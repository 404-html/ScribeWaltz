Justin,

17
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:40,130
the Viking Ren is in the house to
tell us about some amazing adventures.

18
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,960
It's going to be educational
and enriching for the soul.

19
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:49,683
Yeah.

20
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:58,040
Justin wren.

21
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:58,671
First of all,

22
00:00:58,671 --> 00:00:59,451
thanks for doing this.

23
00:00:59,451 --> 00:01:00,830
I'm so glad we could fit you in.

24
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:01,251
I was,

25
00:01:01,251 --> 00:01:03,770
I was a little worried we were going to
be able to get you before you got back

26
00:01:03,771 --> 00:01:07,100
to the Congo because you're on
this kind of a whirlwind thing.

27
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,140
You know you have your back at La.

28
00:01:09,141 --> 00:01:10,280
Have for only like a few days,

29
00:01:10,281 --> 00:01:11,000
right?

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,301
Actually,

31
00:01:11,301 --> 00:01:14,780
I head out to Vegas after this and
then I'm driving there and I fly out

32
00:01:14,781 --> 00:01:15,614
tomorrow.

33
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,360
For those who don't know.

34
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:22,420
Justin was a contestant on the ultimate
fighter is a mixed martial arts fighter

35
00:01:22,631 --> 00:01:24,890
in the heavyweight division for the UFC.

36
00:01:24,891 --> 00:01:27,890
And then I started reading some stuff.

37
00:01:27,891 --> 00:01:31,160
I think the first thing I read
about it was a on the underground,

38
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:31,490
uh,

39
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:32,870
which has mixed martial arts.com.

40
00:01:32,871 --> 00:01:34,760
It's this great website
that we both belong to.

41
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:36,440
It's probably the best,

42
00:01:36,441 --> 00:01:36,830
uh,

43
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,750
mixed martial arts message
board in the country,

44
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,093
in the world really.

45
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:40,963
And uh,

46
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:41,900
there was a,

47
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,850
uh,

48
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:48,110
a thread where it was talking about you
going over there and helping people in

49
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:51,500
the Congo and working with these pygmies
and this would become something you

50
00:01:51,501 --> 00:01:52,101
were really,

51
00:01:52,101 --> 00:01:53,270
really devoted to.

52
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:53,991
And I was like,

53
00:01:53,991 --> 00:01:54,441
wow.

54
00:01:54,441 --> 00:01:55,470
Like who saw that common?

55
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,363
Like check this guy out.

56
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,620
I saw a picture of you before that with
a pig that you had killed with a knife

57
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,790
over your shoulder.

58
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:02,360
You know this,

59
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:02,661
I'm like,

60
00:02:02,661 --> 00:02:03,920
this guy's a fucking savage.

61
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,990
He's got a pig over his shoulder.

62
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:06,590
Yeah.

63
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,690
There's a picture of you with this,

64
00:02:08,691 --> 00:02:09,020
uh,

65
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,150
with this wild hog over your shoulder.

66
00:02:11,151 --> 00:02:11,541
I'm like,

67
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:13,010
I want to party with Justin wren.

68
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,330
And the next thing you know,

69
00:02:14,331 --> 00:02:16,490
you go from there and you're,

70
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:16,761
uh,

71
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,350
your mixed martial arts fighter,

72
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,550
hog killer,

73
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,570
pygmy saver.

74
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,081
I mean you're,

75
00:02:21,081 --> 00:02:23,120
you're over there helping all
these people in the Congo.

76
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,700
How did it all this get started man,

77
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,560
I just heard about how much
they were suffering and uh,

78
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:29,800
I,

79
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,130
I had no clue.

80
00:02:31,131 --> 00:02:33,710
Like I fighting,

81
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,180
I wanted to fight against people,

82
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:35,511
you know,

83
00:02:35,511 --> 00:02:36,920
and I wanted my dreams,

84
00:02:36,921 --> 00:02:37,754
my everything.

85
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,380
And then when I heard about the pygmies,

86
00:02:39,381 --> 00:02:41,210
I just heard the suffering
that they were going through.

87
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,320
I heard that they felt forgotten her,

88
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:44,210
that they were enslaved.

89
00:02:44,211 --> 00:02:47,810
I heard that the four out of 10 is the
small stack that you can find four out of

90
00:02:47,811 --> 00:02:49,730
10 of their children die before age five.

91
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:50,961
And so for me,

92
00:02:50,961 --> 00:02:51,681
I was just like,

93
00:02:51,681 --> 00:02:51,921
man,

94
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:52,754
that's brutal.

95
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,330
And I knew that they were not given
citizenship in their own country and so I

96
00:02:56,331 --> 00:02:59,710
just went there to just learn and
see and sit with live with them,

97
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:00,130
sit

98
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:00,911
around the campfire.

99
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:02,980
That's where I've learned most
whenever the slave masters on,

100
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:04,150
around whenever,

101
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:04,720
uh,

102
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,160
whenever those guys are asleep,

103
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,440
then they'll really open up and tell
you what everything is happening.

104
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,220
Um,

105
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,920
and so it was just a ton of suffering
and that's how I went over there.

106
00:03:11,921 --> 00:03:14,110
I just went with a burden to
find out what was going on.

107
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,400
Could you put that a
little closer to yeah,

108
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,263
absolutely.

109
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,310
How did you find out about it at first?

110
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:18,791
What was the,

111
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:19,624
uh,

112
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:20,260
what,

113
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:20,681
what mean?

114
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:21,640
What led you to this?

115
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,560
Uh,

116
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,070
I had a buddy that was having a plan to
go to the Congo and he was going all by

117
00:03:27,071 --> 00:03:29,350
himself and I mean just completely,

118
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,340
utterly alone.

119
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,800
And it was like the worst
conflict zone on the planet.

120
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:33,251
And,

121
00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:33,940
uh,

122
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,990
heard about what he was doing,

123
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:35,720
heard about,

124
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,553
uh,

125
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,250
what was happening with the
pygmies and heard his wife,

126
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:39,760
uh,

127
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,050
was a little worried that he was going.

128
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,411
And,

129
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:41,651
uh,

130
00:03:41,651 --> 00:03:45,490
I just was looking for something with
purpose and passion and I felt like I

131
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:47,260
could be passionate about
fighting for people.

132
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,990
And so I went with them and uh,

133
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,750
heard all the terrible stuff that was
going on and we went there to see what we

134
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:53,584
could do to help.

135
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,370
Wow,

136
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,450
that's so inspiring.

137
00:03:55,451 --> 00:03:57,370
And for folks who haven't seen it,

138
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,480
there's a video that Justin did that's
gone viral and this has really brought a

139
00:04:01,481 --> 00:04:03,440
lot of attention to your cause and,

140
00:04:03,441 --> 00:04:03,940
and what,

141
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:04,773
what you're doing.

142
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,950
There's a video of you with
these young pygmy children then,

143
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:11,600
or is this the first time
they're seeing a white man to,

144
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:12,670
to preface the video?

145
00:04:12,671 --> 00:04:14,590
This is actually not the pygmies.

146
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,453
The video.

147
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:16,570
It's actually the band too.

148
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:20,230
And the band to are the tribe that's
actually enslaving the pygmies.

149
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:20,801
Oh my God.

150
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:21,520
So it was,

151
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:21,821
yeah,

152
00:04:21,821 --> 00:04:22,540
it was uh,

153
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,650
around some of the pygmies,

154
00:04:23,651 --> 00:04:25,480
but this was the least remote location.

155
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,620
Like you'll see that there wasn't many
trees where I went was 85 kilometers deep

156
00:04:29,621 --> 00:04:33,150
in the jungle where you couldn't even see
the sky because the canopy of the rain

157
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,000
forest is so tall.

158
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,830
And so this was the band.

159
00:04:35,831 --> 00:04:37,060
Two people in the band too.

160
00:04:37,061 --> 00:04:38,380
People are ones that enslave them.

161
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,380
He was actually a gift because I don't,

162
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,420
that video to me is a real gift.

163
00:04:42,421 --> 00:04:42,551
It,

164
00:04:42,551 --> 00:04:43,384
it shows me,

165
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:44,543
uh,

166
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,000
even though I hated their parents,

167
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:46,620
um,

168
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:46,870
uh,

169
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,320
you know,

170
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,740
you can't even see that in the video
that I actually just had a hatred in my

171
00:04:50,741 --> 00:04:51,391
heart towards it,

172
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:52,510
the parents of these kids.

173
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:53,853
Um,

174
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,131
but yeah,

175
00:04:54,131 --> 00:04:55,630
so that was brutal because I,

176
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,950
on the Ugi also,

177
00:04:56,951 --> 00:04:57,970
I posted a video.

178
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:58,870
Um,

179
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,700
we're actually a thread about how I,

180
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,930
I buried a,

181
00:05:01,931 --> 00:05:02,620
uh,

182
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,220
a one and a half year old in the
Congo and his name was Andy Bo.

183
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,530
And so this video that's
playing right now,

184
00:05:08,531 --> 00:05:10,270
you can't even tell that they were,

185
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:10,980
uh,

186
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:11,280
that,

187
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,770
that their parents are responsible
for the grave that I dug,

188
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,180
I think two days before that video.

189
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,170
So these are the boon to people's Bam,

190
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:24,410
to the a n t u and the band two
people are in slaving the pygmies.

191
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:27,280
And this has been going on for how long?

192
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:28,893
Uh,

193
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,520
it's actually rather recent.

194
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:31,001
I mean,

195
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:33,550
there's been types of it
for hundreds of years,

196
00:05:33,551 --> 00:05:33,761
but,

197
00:05:33,761 --> 00:05:34,420
uh,

198
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,490
they have different kinds of
slavery within the pygmies.

199
00:05:36,491 --> 00:05:38,550
There's ones that
they're held to gunpoint.

200
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,131
Uh,

201
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:42,160
there's by the rebels and the
gold and Colton at diamond mines.

202
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:42,560
Uh,

203
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,140
and then there's other ones where they're,

204
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:45,130
they're in shackles,

205
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,140
but then the ones that we've actually,

206
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,340
I didn't get to say that yet,

207
00:05:48,341 --> 00:05:49,870
but we've actually set some slaves free.

208
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,970
Some pygmy slaves that
were from the band too.

209
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:56,350
And we negotiated with the band to
people who go up and they buy up the land

210
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,650
from underneath the pygmies.

211
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,930
Pygmies don't have a way
to make any monetary gain.

212
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,550
They don't get paid anything and money.

213
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,140
They get paid sometimes corn,

214
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,460
sometimes bags of salt,

215
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:05,690
sometimes bars of soap,

216
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,710
like a bar of soap for two days of work
they might get a bar soap to bathe with.

217
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:10,460
Um,

218
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,750
and so yeah,

219
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:14,600
the Bantu people are the ones that
are enslaving them that we're actually

220
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,220
negotiating with them to,

221
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,083
to free him.

222
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:17,923
Wow.

223
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:18,590
Yeah.

224
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,600
What a crazy environment that must be.

225
00:06:20,601 --> 00:06:21,620
The Congo itself,

226
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:26,000
not being able to see the sky and
having all this insane conflict going on

227
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:27,800
underneath the canopy of these trees.

228
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:32,510
Also primitive dealing with things
like slavery and forcing people.

229
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:36,410
What's really crazy is forcing people
to work in the minds to create the very

230
00:06:36,411 --> 00:06:40,610
things that we need to power our most
technologically advanced pieces of

231
00:06:40,611 --> 00:06:41,210
electronics.

232
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,200
Like these laptops,

233
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,431
that Cold Tan,

234
00:06:43,431 --> 00:06:43,900
right?

235
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,180
Yeah.

236
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:44,720
Colton,

237
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,810
I think 80 to 90% of it
is found in the Congo.

238
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,180
So it's only found in
two places in the world.

239
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,890
80 to 90% of it's the Congo.

240
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,540
100% of its rebel owned.

241
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,770
There's not a legit mine.

242
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,480
And so that's insane.

243
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,340
Most of it's pygmy slave mind.

244
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,790
100% of it is rebel from the Congo.

245
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:02,121
Yes.

246
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:03,560
The Democratic Republic of Congo,

247
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,940
all of it is rebel owned.

248
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,150
So there is no Karma free cell phones,

249
00:07:08,151 --> 00:07:08,984
electronics,

250
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,550
smartphones,

251
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:11,271
not max,

252
00:07:11,271 --> 00:07:12,470
not flat screen TVs.

253
00:07:12,471 --> 00:07:14,900
So I mean I support it even I have the,

254
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,310
the apple products,

255
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:16,941
iPad,

256
00:07:16,941 --> 00:07:17,774
iPhone,

257
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,470
everything.

258
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,090
What a bizarre,

259
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,110
fascinating sort of a
statement on humanity that is.

260
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:24,441
Yeah.

261
00:07:24,441 --> 00:07:25,550
It's actually pretty crazy man,

262
00:07:25,551 --> 00:07:26,870
because I had um,

263
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,960
some pygmies come one time and give me
some Colton and I didn't know what it was

264
00:07:29,961 --> 00:07:30,794
though at the time.

265
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,350
Uh,

266
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,091
I didn't know.

267
00:07:32,091 --> 00:07:35,420
I knew that there's golden diamond
mines there and that they were slaves in

268
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:36,020
those,

269
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,650
but I had no clue what Colton was
a and that was after my first trip.

270
00:07:39,651 --> 00:07:43,280
But they actually put some Colton in my
hands and I was holding it and they were

271
00:07:43,281 --> 00:07:44,540
really excited to give it to me,

272
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:44,751
you know,

273
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:46,650
this is why their slaves and,

274
00:07:46,651 --> 00:07:50,120
and and so they thought I'd be a static
and so I'm having to ask my translator

275
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:50,954
like what?

276
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,600
Like what is this stuff
they're handing me?

277
00:07:53,601 --> 00:07:57,680
I didn't know if it was like a rough
diamonds or if deep inside there there was

278
00:07:57,681 --> 00:07:58,760
gold or what it was,

279
00:07:58,761 --> 00:07:59,540
but it was Colton.

280
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,373
What does it look like?

281
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,950
It's like this black dark mineral.

282
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:04,610
It's almost,

283
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,730
some of it almost looks like a crystal
or I don't know if you can throw up a

284
00:08:07,731 --> 00:08:08,480
picture.

285
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,290
Almost like coal.

286
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:09,621
Yeah,

287
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:10,454
almost like goal.

288
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,360
Um,

289
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:11,770
it's,

290
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:14,150
it's long and Jaggedy it's kind of a,

291
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:14,870
I dunno,

292
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,081
you know,

293
00:08:15,081 --> 00:08:18,950
those like crystals that you can use to
be able to buy like that are long like

294
00:08:18,951 --> 00:08:20,690
that there'd be a black
one of those almost.

295
00:08:20,691 --> 00:08:22,730
And sometimes it has more of a coal,

296
00:08:22,731 --> 00:08:25,430
like charcoal kind of
feature to it and it's,

297
00:08:25,431 --> 00:08:26,100
it's heavy.

298
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:26,510
Uh,

299
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,111
but it's,

300
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:29,750
it's a great conduit for electricity
and that's why we're using it in all our

301
00:08:29,751 --> 00:08:30,770
smartphones and everything.

302
00:08:30,771 --> 00:08:31,820
And that's why they're slaves.

303
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,310
But I wasn't excited about it and
I didn't know what it was and I,

304
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:35,271
but for them,

305
00:08:35,271 --> 00:08:35,451
you know,

306
00:08:35,451 --> 00:08:36,284
think how,

307
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,460
think how crazy that is.

308
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:40,760
That's why they're slaves and
I don't even know what it is.

309
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,190
And they're just a
static to give it to me.

310
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,990
And while it's a huge source,

311
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:45,510
I mean,

312
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,970
you need it all over the world.

313
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:47,540
Yeah.

314
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,780
And most people are completely
ignorant as to what it is and a set,

315
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:52,160
especially where it comes from.

316
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:52,940
Right?

317
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,181
Yeah.

318
00:08:53,181 --> 00:08:54,110
It's very bizarre.

319
00:08:54,111 --> 00:08:55,980
Like I had explained that to someone when

320
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,090
they were talking about,

321
00:08:57,091 --> 00:08:57,470
um,

322
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:57,690
uh,

323
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,700
how much better it is
to have an electric car.

324
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:00,421
And I'm like,

325
00:09:00,421 --> 00:09:03,150
do you understand that that car
is filled with conflict minerals?

326
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,010
Like it's not that simple.

327
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,270
It's not as simple as like,

328
00:09:06,271 --> 00:09:06,901
you're good.

329
00:09:06,901 --> 00:09:08,640
And the guy with the gas guzzlers bad.

330
00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:08,880
Like,

331
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,301
no,

332
00:09:09,301 --> 00:09:12,720
there's a lot of fuck Uri
in creation of your car.

333
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,330
Batteries like lithium ion.

334
00:09:15,331 --> 00:09:17,220
That's another reason
why we're in Afghanistan.

335
00:09:17,221 --> 00:09:20,360
This is a lithium stores is
trillions of dollars of lithium and,

336
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,300
and Afghanistan.

337
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,640
And that's what you need
for lithium ion batteries.

338
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:24,620
Yeah.

339
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,400
Yeah.

340
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:25,671
I mean,

341
00:09:25,671 --> 00:09:26,360
it's insane.

342
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,193
I,

343
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,460
I can't even,

344
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:28,970
I don't,

345
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:29,241
I mean,

346
00:09:29,241 --> 00:09:30,200
I know we have two hours,

347
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,280
but I don't even know if I
could get into some of the,

348
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:33,141
the stuff.

349
00:09:33,141 --> 00:09:36,710
I know that Shane from vice has been on
here and then someone was saying someone

350
00:09:36,711 --> 00:09:37,790
else from your end tomorrow.

351
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:38,370
Is He really?

352
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,203
Oh Man.

353
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,460
I wish I could meet that dude.

354
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:40,930
Uh,

355
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,050
each has a cool guy.

356
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,651
You want to meet him?

357
00:09:42,651 --> 00:09:43,910
If he could stay til tomorrow,

358
00:09:43,911 --> 00:09:44,530
you can meet him.

359
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:44,901
All right.

360
00:09:44,901 --> 00:09:47,320
We'll have to see about my plane
back or something like that.

361
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,770
He'd be happy to meet you,

362
00:09:48,771 --> 00:09:49,041
man.

363
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:49,480
He's a big,

364
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:49,660
crazy,

365
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,700
coolest motherfucker on her.

366
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,070
I think he's awesome.

367
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:52,210
Yeah,

368
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:52,951
he's a great guy.

369
00:09:52,951 --> 00:09:54,320
You see super easy to talk to,

370
00:09:54,321 --> 00:09:56,610
to just really like down to earth.

371
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,310
And he goes to some of
the craziest places.

372
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,060
Oh yeah.

373
00:09:59,060 --> 00:09:59,571
Oh yeah,

374
00:09:59,571 --> 00:10:01,280
he's returning back and forth.

375
00:10:01,281 --> 00:10:01,730
You know,

376
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,920
I wonder what he thinks about
me going for a full year.

377
00:10:03,921 --> 00:10:04,191
Just,

378
00:10:04,191 --> 00:10:07,580
I know that he said it was a
crazy time going there and uh,

379
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,440
and I just would want to pick his brain.

380
00:10:09,441 --> 00:10:10,310
What party you went to.

381
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,293
Is that what you're doing now?

382
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,230
You're about to go for a year?

383
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:12,970
For a full year?

384
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:13,310
Yeah.

385
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:17,270
I'm going to go for a full year and I'm
partnering with the Oldest University in

386
00:10:17,271 --> 00:10:21,690
the Congo and they have been working on
this project for seven years and we kind

387
00:10:21,691 --> 00:10:23,860
of just linked up together to where,

388
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,500
uh,

389
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,940
our visions just are kind of the same.

390
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,610
We want to free these people and
give them a sustainable ways of life.

391
00:10:28,611 --> 00:10:29,270
So,

392
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:29,570
um,

393
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:32,330
one of my best friends now was
born and raised in the Congo,

394
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,471
was educated,

395
00:10:33,471 --> 00:10:34,820
got his doctorates in Australia,

396
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:39,110
but then he came back to the Congo and
he's the dean of the School of community

397
00:10:39,111 --> 00:10:39,710
development.

398
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,390
So we teach you some
different ways of agriculture,

399
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:41,651
water,

400
00:10:41,651 --> 00:10:42,350
wills,

401
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,280
all these kinds of things.

402
00:10:43,281 --> 00:10:44,660
So he's actually setting them free.

403
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,550
And that's what we did in September.

404
00:10:46,551 --> 00:10:48,200
We saw 60 slaves be set free,

405
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,900
put on 30 acres of land and get a water.

406
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:52,400
Well now it's doubled.

407
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,080
Now since I've been back here,

408
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,900
it's been 120 slaves that free men,

409
00:10:56,901 --> 00:10:58,940
women and children put
on 60 acres of land.

410
00:10:59,300 --> 00:10:59,990
And then now,

411
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,380
uh,

412
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:00,681
you know,

413
00:11:00,681 --> 00:11:02,210
we were wanting to find a way,

414
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,040
we think that me going there for a year,

415
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,210
and if we were able to fund raise $50,000
so we could find a thousand people at

416
00:11:08,211 --> 00:11:09,044
50 bucks,

417
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:09,801
thousand people,

418
00:11:09,801 --> 00:11:10,221
50 Bucks,

419
00:11:10,221 --> 00:11:12,170
that's a thousand slaves freedom.

420
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,161
And it would,

421
00:11:13,161 --> 00:11:13,311
it's,

422
00:11:13,311 --> 00:11:14,144
it's a nuts,

423
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:14,541
um,

424
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:15,860
amount of stuff that that would do.

425
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,390
How many people are
slaves right now there?

426
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:18,381
Well,

427
00:11:18,381 --> 00:11:20,450
the pygmies in the
Democratic Republic of Congo,

428
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,350
there's a few different,

429
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,880
it's hard for them to do a census,

430
00:11:22,881 --> 00:11:23,211
you know,

431
00:11:23,211 --> 00:11:23,481
I mean,

432
00:11:23,481 --> 00:11:27,050
these are hunters and gatherers and
nomads and slaves and then in dangerous

433
00:11:27,051 --> 00:11:28,550
areas and then really remote area.

434
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,660
So there's a few different senses and,

435
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:30,910
uh,

436
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,060
that they've tried to do.

437
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:35,240
The lowest I've seen is 300,000
pygmies and then another,

438
00:11:35,241 --> 00:11:36,530
I've seen a 600,000.

439
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:40,100
And pygmy actually literally
translated means elbow height.

440
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,290
So I mean they're smaller
than everybody else.

441
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:43,600
It's almost like they're just a,

442
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,320
the worst bullying victims,

443
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:45,620
uh,

444
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,453
that I've ever been.

445
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,860
So the average men's
height is four foot seven.

446
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:49,980
So are,

447
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,920
are they in any way like a,

448
00:11:51,921 --> 00:11:54,880
have you ever seen any of that stuff on?

449
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:55,714
Um,

450
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,050
uh,

451
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:56,381
the,

452
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:56,621
uh,

453
00:11:56,621 --> 00:11:57,161
the Hobbit,

454
00:11:57,161 --> 00:11:57,881
people from,

455
00:11:57,881 --> 00:11:58,120
uh,

456
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,391
this,

457
00:11:58,391 --> 00:11:58,600
uh,

458
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,010
island of,

459
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:00,844
um,

460
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,260
the remains they found now.

461
00:12:02,261 --> 00:12:02,501
Yeah.

462
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:04,690
They found remains of people that lived,

463
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,553
you know,

464
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,630
tens of thousands of years ago with,

465
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,760
with humans and they were the real tiny,

466
00:12:09,761 --> 00:12:11,350
like almost people like things.

467
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,130
It's,

468
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,710
it really interesting when you see like
some of them like the pygmies where you

469
00:12:14,711 --> 00:12:17,470
have like a whole race of them that
are like really tiny like that.

470
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,490
It makes you wonder like,

471
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:19,541
how did that,

472
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:22,120
how did that separate
strain branch off way,

473
00:12:22,121 --> 00:12:22,451
way,

474
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:23,590
way back in the day.

475
00:12:23,591 --> 00:12:25,950
And the evolutionary chain of these,

476
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,340
these people being developed.

477
00:12:27,341 --> 00:12:28,174
It's really odd.

478
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,160
I mean,

479
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:29,831
it actually,

480
00:12:29,831 --> 00:12:30,640
one of the,

481
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,900
one of the problems that they,

482
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:32,200
uh,

483
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,760
they have is that,

484
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,090
um,

485
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,460
they're called half man,

486
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:36,760
half animal.

487
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:36,941
Uh,

488
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:38,110
by the surrounding tribes.

489
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,600
And so that's one reason
why I've met people,

490
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,440
uh,

491
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,400
that have been,

492
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,420
that their families,

493
00:12:43,421 --> 00:12:45,820
members of their families have
been victim of cannibalism.

494
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:46,511
Uh,

495
00:12:46,511 --> 00:12:47,051
and so yeah,

496
00:12:47,051 --> 00:12:47,200
I've,

497
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,371
I've,

498
00:12:47,371 --> 00:12:50,620
I've pictures that Santa
Buzz of cannibalism,

499
00:12:50,621 --> 00:12:51,454
they actually,

500
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,210
the surrounding tribes believe that if
you can consume the flesh of a pygmy,

501
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:55,781
uh,

502
00:12:55,781 --> 00:12:58,960
that you can gain super human strength.

503
00:12:58,961 --> 00:12:59,350
I mean,

504
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:03,940
from taking the genitals off of small
bullies and putting them under businesses,

505
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:04,391
uh,

506
00:13:04,391 --> 00:13:06,790
it will bring you wealth
from eating their flesh.

507
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,060
Yeah.

508
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,420
The rebels believe that if you
eat their flesh that you can,

509
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:10,780
uh,

510
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,350
what does it,

511
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,690
it makes you not bulletproof,

512
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,211
but what does it,

513
00:13:13,211 --> 00:13:14,830
whenever a bullet can just
fly right through you.

514
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,870
So basically not invisible pervious.

515
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:19,260
So it just,

516
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:19,491
they,

517
00:13:19,491 --> 00:13:22,600
that's what they believe you that you
take children's genitals and they put them

518
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:23,590
under a business.

519
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,000
That's what they'll do to them.

520
00:13:25,001 --> 00:13:25,421
And then we'll,

521
00:13:25,421 --> 00:13:26,140
uh,

522
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,700
think that that brings him many blessings.

523
00:13:27,701 --> 00:13:27,821
It,

524
00:13:27,821 --> 00:13:29,890
that some of the witch doctors
have done that and Uganda,

525
00:13:29,891 --> 00:13:30,880
but they do it in Congo.

526
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:31,401
Ah,

527
00:13:31,401 --> 00:13:36,010
the part of the Congo that I'm going
to is it borders Rwanda and Uganda.

528
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:39,850
And so I'm right over the border
and then in the jungle kind of,

529
00:13:39,851 --> 00:13:40,590
um,

530
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,880
Booney as where Shalom university is.

531
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,640
And then 85 kilometers from there,

532
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:48,280
there's a part of the
Congo called commander.

533
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,330
Um,

534
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,320
they say it differently than that,

535
00:13:50,321 --> 00:13:53,770
but then we go from there deep
into the jungle and where that is,

536
00:13:53,771 --> 00:13:56,110
there's some different
rebel groups that have,

537
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,840
that have done just brutal stuff there.

538
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,111
And,

539
00:13:59,111 --> 00:13:59,261
uh,

540
00:13:59,261 --> 00:14:00,400
that's some of their beliefs.

541
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,440
Wow.

542
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:01,730
Yeah,

543
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:02,530
I was pretty crazy.

544
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:06,460
There's one place gets so messed up that
[inaudible] crazy man as they should

545
00:14:06,461 --> 00:14:06,551
be.

546
00:14:06,551 --> 00:14:10,090
The richest country on the
entire face of this planet.

547
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,160
They have every element
on the periodic table,

548
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,053
every single one.

549
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,013
And uh,

550
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,430
and they have the most fertile soil.

551
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,810
They have gold diamonds.

552
00:14:16,811 --> 00:14:17,670
Now Colton,

553
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,640
with all this taken off,

554
00:14:18,641 --> 00:14:20,410
they should really be the
richest country there is.

555
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:23,080
And then all the corruption
and everything just ruins it.

556
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:23,490
It's,

557
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:24,070
it's so,

558
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,030
it's so crazy.

559
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,650
The corruption is so nuts.

560
00:14:26,651 --> 00:14:28,900
The warlords and the whole system that,

561
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:29,230
uh,

562
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,970
that they've got going on down there.

563
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:31,661
It's so,

564
00:14:31,661 --> 00:14:36,661
it's so bizarre to look at the United
States of America here in 2013 how

565
00:14:37,231 --> 00:14:40,330
everything is and then realize there's
another part of the world that exists in

566
00:14:40,331 --> 00:14:44,530
the same time that is essentially living
the way people live thousands of years

567
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:45,700
ago with guns though.

568
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,300
Yeah,

569
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:46,840
absolutely.

570
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,970
And that's what's so crazy is the pygmies.

571
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,290
I actually have my grandpa's,

572
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,320
I've been accepted as
family there now and um,

573
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:52,740
I,

574
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:57,290
my grandpa [inaudible] is his name
[inaudible] and he gave me his bow.

575
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,830
So it's pygmy bow and arrow that he's
had for 30 40 years old in your hands.

576
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,060
It's actually pretty tiny man.

577
00:15:02,061 --> 00:15:03,110
It's pretty tiny but,

578
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,143
but in it,

579
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:07,880
it has all these things that are almost
like a pygmy tally mark and it's all up

580
00:15:07,881 --> 00:15:10,700
and down at the top of the bow
and the bottom of the bone inside.

581
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:13,970
And it's all the kills that he
has of certain types of antelope.

582
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,073
And he gave me the,

583
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,640
I think I have like 10 arrows,

584
00:15:16,641 --> 00:15:17,930
five with like the metal on it.

585
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,470
And then for that are just straight would
that are sharpened and they have this

586
00:15:21,471 --> 00:15:23,630
like circular thing around the tip of it.

587
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:27,410
And I thought the ones that are metal
would be the ones for the antelope because

588
00:15:27,411 --> 00:15:28,850
they look like they would do more damage.

589
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,070
But it's actually the ones that
don't have the metal on it,

590
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:31,670
uh,

591
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:35,000
that are just carved a out of the wood
that are the ones that go after the

592
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:38,630
antelope because they dip
the tips of them in poison.

593
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,370
And so it's poisoned arrows.

594
00:15:40,371 --> 00:15:42,810
And those are the ones that go
after with the biggest ones in the,

595
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,160
the metal ones are more for like monkeys
and small little pigs and things like

596
00:15:46,161 --> 00:15:46,994
that.

597
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:47,451
Wow.

598
00:15:47,451 --> 00:15:50,870
So you're going to go there and live
with these people in like a tent made out

599
00:15:50,871 --> 00:15:51,704
of leaves?

600
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,100
Yeah.

601
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:52,660
It's a,

602
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,450
a twig,

603
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:54,590
a Twiggly fuck man.

604
00:15:54,591 --> 00:15:56,540
You shouldn't pull the
people see the picture.

605
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,230
Do you have it on your
website or anything?

606
00:15:58,231 --> 00:15:59,310
When did you send me those pictures?

607
00:15:59,310 --> 00:15:59,560
Yeah,

608
00:15:59,560 --> 00:15:59,810
I,

609
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:00,890
some of the pictures over.

610
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:01,783
Um,

611
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,061
yeah,

612
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:03,520
it's a twig leaf hut and they,

613
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,330
they rebuild them basically every night.

614
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:06,680
Every night.

615
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:06,921
Well,

616
00:16:06,921 --> 00:16:08,330
it depends on if it was raining,

617
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,193
the rain forest.

618
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,640
And then if it's a,

619
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,140
if the wind is blowing,

620
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:12,711
uh,

621
00:16:12,711 --> 00:16:13,730
actually have pictures of,

622
00:16:13,731 --> 00:16:17,570
I think like the widows and orphans that
lived in one hut together were just in

623
00:16:17,571 --> 00:16:18,201
the middle of the night.

624
00:16:18,201 --> 00:16:19,130
It didn't even rain that night,

625
00:16:19,131 --> 00:16:20,060
but the wind blew in.

626
00:16:20,061 --> 00:16:21,020
Their whole roof came off.

627
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,950
And so they have to go get the leafs again
and place them over banana leaves and

628
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:25,191
different,

629
00:16:25,191 --> 00:16:27,130
like those big elephant looking here,

630
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:27,900
leafs.

631
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,420
And so they just get
those and they cover up,

632
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,110
um,

633
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:33,710
in nine different villages I went to last
time I was there for a month and nine

634
00:16:33,711 --> 00:16:35,990
different villages don't we do not
one of them ever owned a blanket,

635
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,000
so they're just sleeping
straight on the dirt,

636
00:16:38,001 --> 00:16:38,240
man.

637
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:38,720
That's it.

638
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,890
And no blankets?

639
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:40,730
No,

640
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:41,270
no,

641
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,920
just sleeping straight on the dirt.

642
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:43,610
Wow.

643
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:46,580
First Time I went to one of those tribes
was I saw the chief and I was putting

644
00:16:46,581 --> 00:16:50,030
up my tent and they about lost
it and had a little air mattress,

645
00:16:50,031 --> 00:16:50,360
you know,

646
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,290
and I had a sleeping bag and I mean
to them that was the Ritz Carlton.

647
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,150
So I let the chief habit and I said,

648
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,360
yeah,

649
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,550
so I let him have that and I
slept in his hut and uh wow.

650
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:02,120
Yeah.

651
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,210
And then site.

652
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:03,861
Yeah,

653
00:17:03,861 --> 00:17:07,160
he was man and they all passed around the
air mattress and that they're actually

654
00:17:07,161 --> 00:17:08,300
like holding it up above them.

655
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,460
Almost like a crowd surfing,

656
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,680
like crowd surfing at a concert.

657
00:17:12,681 --> 00:17:14,780
But they're doing that with Eric
mattress so everyone could feel it.

658
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:15,763
Wow.

659
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:16,370
Yeah.

660
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,080
So they've never had mattresses.

661
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,850
I mean this isn't like
a new thing to them.

662
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:21,380
They've slept on dirt forever.

663
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:21,920
Yeah.

664
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,970
I haven't come across one pygmy in the
remote locations that had been to the

665
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:26,570
other ever.

666
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:30,080
Pygmies and other locations that have
cities or anything like that or no,

667
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,381
no,

668
00:17:30,381 --> 00:17:30,541
they're,

669
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:33,020
they're actually basically if
they come to a city at all.

670
00:17:33,021 --> 00:17:33,350
So yeah,

671
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:33,831
there we go.

672
00:17:33,831 --> 00:17:35,300
That would be home sweet home for,

673
00:17:35,301 --> 00:17:35,600
uh,

674
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,433
for a full year.

675
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,540
That's the kind of villages
that I'm staying in.

676
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:39,800
And if you look in there,

677
00:17:39,801 --> 00:17:43,760
I think on top of one of those huts
there's like a few clothes and if they,

678
00:17:43,761 --> 00:17:45,030
if a pygmies had close,

679
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:45,864
they've been a slave.

680
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,590
So there's basically the
only pygmies that are there.

681
00:17:48,591 --> 00:17:48,831
Yeah.

682
00:17:48,831 --> 00:17:50,100
So some of the clothes,

683
00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:54,450
so obviously these ones were have been
slaves and most of the ones I've ever

684
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:55,281
been to have been slaves.

685
00:17:55,281 --> 00:17:58,380
We've only been like one village I've
been to where they were so remote that

686
00:17:58,381 --> 00:18:01,560
they still weren't enslaved and
they can be hunters and gatherers.

687
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:05,310
But the deforestation with
the trees falling that you
could drive to Mack trucks

688
00:18:05,311 --> 00:18:06,370
through a,

689
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:09,360
those are scaring all the animals away
to where they basically can no longer

690
00:18:09,361 --> 00:18:13,290
live like hunters and gatherers because
the animals just flee from all the trees

691
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:13,890
falling.

692
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:14,820
So the,

693
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,020
there isn't loggers,

694
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:16,883
is that what it is?

695
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:17,581
It's loggers,

696
00:18:17,581 --> 00:18:19,080
but it's also the guys that are,

697
00:18:19,081 --> 00:18:19,380
uh,

698
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,213
like the Bantu,

699
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,061
the slave masters,

700
00:18:21,061 --> 00:18:22,830
they can get the pygmies,

701
00:18:22,831 --> 00:18:25,380
they're slaves to go
cut these trees down in,

702
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,161
into pygmies.

703
00:18:26,161 --> 00:18:26,994
Trees are wholly,

704
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:27,420
uh,

705
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,820
they believe that the ancestors of their,

706
00:18:29,821 --> 00:18:30,270
um,

707
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:30,451
yeah,

708
00:18:30,451 --> 00:18:31,740
their ancestors live inside.

709
00:18:31,741 --> 00:18:34,190
The trees become trees and uh,

710
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,230
they bury their dead inside
holes inside of trees.

711
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:38,520
They find an opening in it.

712
00:18:38,521 --> 00:18:38,970
They'll put,

713
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:39,900
put their dead there.

714
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,010
Um,

715
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:44,190
and so they're having to cut down what
they've lived in for thousands of years.

716
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:47,970
And then the rain forest preservationist
and wildlife conservationist,

717
00:18:47,971 --> 00:18:48,720
they,

718
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,590
they push them out.

719
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:52,650
They'll buy up the land and they'll
say pygmies aren't good for this.

720
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,980
And they'll kick them off the land and
they'll buy up thousands and thousands of

721
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:56,250
acres.

722
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,930
Actually thousands of square cushions.

723
00:18:58,670 --> 00:18:58,920
Yeah.

724
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,150
They'll kick the pygmies off.

725
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,820
So they're more interested in the
trees and the are the pygmies.

726
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:03,630
Absolutely.

727
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:04,200
Wow.

728
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:04,471
Yeah.

729
00:19:04,471 --> 00:19:04,540
I,

730
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:04,851
I've,

731
00:19:04,851 --> 00:19:05,210
I've,

732
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:09,270
I've heard from my family members in
the pig pygmy tribe and when I say this,

733
00:19:09,271 --> 00:19:14,271
like literally I have pygmy family that
are more family to me than some of my

734
00:19:14,401 --> 00:19:16,050
family here in the u s and so on.

735
00:19:16,051 --> 00:19:17,970
Crazy cousin who gets
drunk and grabbed it there.

736
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,281
We're sure.

737
00:19:20,281 --> 00:19:20,790
Yeah,

738
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:23,880
there's some piggies I just
love man that I love and uh,

739
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,470
and you speak their language.

740
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:26,363
I must speak the language.

741
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,301
I speak some of it,

742
00:19:27,301 --> 00:19:27,541
man.

743
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:27,840
But,

744
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,471
but not a lot.

745
00:19:28,471 --> 00:19:31,020
And during that year there
for my birthday coming up,

746
00:19:31,021 --> 00:19:32,100
I'm going to get Rosetta stone,

747
00:19:32,101 --> 00:19:32,851
I think in a,

748
00:19:32,851 --> 00:19:33,510
that's what I'm asking.

749
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,231
How could you not?

750
00:19:34,231 --> 00:19:35,430
You're going to live there for a year.

751
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,630
You say you love these people.

752
00:19:36,631 --> 00:19:39,180
What do they have been talking shit about
you the whole time and you gotta learn

753
00:19:39,181 --> 00:19:40,200
pygmy and find out?

754
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:40,620
Well,

755
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,453
they don't have,

756
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,110
they don't have a Rosetta stone.

757
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:45,803
That'd be funny though.

758
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,220
I'm the crazy uncle.

759
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,020
What is the language that they have?

760
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:49,920
Like what is it called?

761
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,570
It's like a,

762
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:52,740
it's not the clicking is,

763
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,670
but it's close.

764
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:56,940
It's actually a tonal
language or a polyphonic.

765
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:57,931
Actually there's,

766
00:19:57,931 --> 00:19:59,130
there's some sweet videos,

767
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:00,390
I don't know if you guys
want to pull any out,

768
00:20:00,391 --> 00:20:01,650
but on youtube there's a,

769
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,630
they do a thing that I love called,

770
00:20:03,631 --> 00:20:04,200
uh,

771
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:04,410
uh,

772
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,430
the water drum.

773
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,740
And that actually isn't
gonna be on my youtube thing,

774
00:20:07,741 --> 00:20:11,910
but you could look up pygmies water drum
and on youtube and there's some sweet

775
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:12,181
songs.

776
00:20:12,181 --> 00:20:13,740
They'll have like seven to eight women,

777
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,311
uh,

778
00:20:14,311 --> 00:20:15,390
inside the river.

779
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,240
And then they,

780
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,800
they each have a part to play and um,

781
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:19,270
wow.

782
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:19,420
Uh,

783
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,960
and they just slapped the water and it's,

784
00:20:20,961 --> 00:20:22,380
it comes out the beautiful songs.

785
00:20:22,381 --> 00:20:26,550
Or they also have something called
polyphonic singing where they each have a,

786
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,330
uh,

787
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,910
a tone that they do and they actually,

788
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,730
some people would call it the language
of song that's trying to think of that,

789
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:33,930
but their language,

790
00:20:33,931 --> 00:20:36,750
sometimes they're joking around with
each other getting into it and it sounds

791
00:20:36,751 --> 00:20:38,130
like they're kind of
singing to one another.

792
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,060
Wow.

793
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:42,210
So that's the ones that are in
the more Romaine remote locations.

794
00:20:42,211 --> 00:20:44,220
The ones that had been slaves
for years and years and years.

795
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,320
They've started to learn to speak Swahili.

796
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:46,990
Yeah,

797
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:47,823
there it is.

798
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,870
And you're not in it for just the boobs,

799
00:20:49,871 --> 00:20:50,704
right?

800
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:51,671
No,

801
00:20:51,671 --> 00:20:52,504
sorry,

802
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,190
the Sag after awhile.

803
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,450
Is there a drum

804
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,240
to that as well or is
that all just the water.

805
00:21:02,241 --> 00:21:02,990
Bottled water.

806
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:03,823
That's awesome.

807
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:07,820
Yeah.

808
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:08,690
This is just three.

809
00:21:08,691 --> 00:21:10,400
Whenever they get like
eight to 10 in there,

810
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,780
they get some intense songs.

811
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,013
This is hilarious.

812
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:18,290
Take a pause.

813
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:19,123
Wipe your eyes.

814
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,170
Wow.

815
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:22,940
They also have something
called the tree drum.

816
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,391
They'll,

817
00:21:23,391 --> 00:21:24,224
they'll uh,

818
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:28,460
hollow out at tree and they'll get some
harder sticks and they'll just beat the

819
00:21:28,461 --> 00:21:29,360
side of a tree.

820
00:21:29,361 --> 00:21:29,840
And it's,

821
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,680
it's odd man.

822
00:21:30,681 --> 00:21:31,190
It's sweet.

823
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,050
So what are you doing for food out there?

824
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:34,490
Uh,

825
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:35,600
the last month I went,

826
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,850
I took about 40 to 50,

827
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,540
uh,

828
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,620
power bars with me.

829
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:41,721
Man,

830
00:21:41,721 --> 00:21:43,910
my bag was so heavy because I had took a,

831
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,980
I took a supplement shop with me and,

832
00:21:45,981 --> 00:21:46,370
uh,

833
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:47,121
but I mean,

834
00:21:47,121 --> 00:21:47,390
they,

835
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,590
caterpillars I've eaten,

836
00:21:48,591 --> 00:21:52,070
like I normally don't ask
the different parts of it,

837
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:52,551
but,

838
00:21:52,551 --> 00:21:53,270
um,

839
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:53,780
uh,

840
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,300
like whenever they do goat,

841
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,630
which actually pygmies don't eat goat,

842
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,150
they believe that it has
a evil spirits inside it.

843
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,310
So even though goats are
really easy to raise,

844
00:22:01,311 --> 00:22:01,781
they won't eat it.

845
00:22:01,781 --> 00:22:02,420
Goat,

846
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:05,000
the hunter say that a goat
makes you weak in the knees.

847
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,580
And then the women just
don't like the flavor of it.

848
00:22:07,581 --> 00:22:08,810
And they all think that it,

849
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:09,530
they've seen it.

850
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:11,030
Evil spirits come inside of them.

851
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:13,940
And so they don't eat goat's
did they see drag me to hell?

852
00:22:13,941 --> 00:22:14,774
Is that what it is?

853
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,430
The Gate becomes the goal becomes evil.

854
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,120
Remember that?

855
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:20,953
I never saw it,

856
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:23,421
but yeah.

857
00:22:23,421 --> 00:22:24,090
And so they,

858
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:24,923
they eat,

859
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,053
they'll eat chicken,

860
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,350
whatever their slaves for.

861
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,520
I have a picture I think of,

862
00:22:28,521 --> 00:22:29,290
uh,

863
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,560
of my buddy Harry and,

864
00:22:30,561 --> 00:22:30,950
um,

865
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:31,191
he,

866
00:22:31,191 --> 00:22:34,100
we call him Harry because he's the only
pygmy I've ever seen with facial hair.

867
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:34,600
Ah,

868
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,150
that's why that video is so unique about
me because I went over there and it

869
00:22:38,151 --> 00:22:39,290
wasn't just like some guy,

870
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,190
uh,

871
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,240
from America that went there.

872
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:41,661
Giant,

873
00:22:41,661 --> 00:22:41,931
White,

874
00:22:41,931 --> 00:22:42,764
hairy dude.

875
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,240
What the fuck is all this?

876
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,300
That's why my buddy started calling
me the great white Sasquatch.

877
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:48,650
What do you think about your tattoos?

878
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:49,431
Oh yeah.

879
00:22:49,431 --> 00:22:49,731
That,

880
00:22:49,731 --> 00:22:50,900
that is a crazy,

881
00:22:50,901 --> 00:22:51,770
not to the pygmies.

882
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,050
The pygmies actually tattooed
their faces sometimes.

883
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:54,640
Um,

884
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,400
the women,

885
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:55,641
uh,

886
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:58,550
I've come across a few of them that
are more like traditional or remote.

887
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,650
Those women still carve their teeth.

888
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,760
I don't know if you can Google that.

889
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,990
They actually carve their teeth and
it makes them almost look more like a,

890
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,240
a Pirana to me it's not attractive,

891
00:23:08,241 --> 00:23:09,260
but to the pygmy men,

892
00:23:09,261 --> 00:23:10,094
it's attractive.

893
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:10,820
Yeah.

894
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,160
They,

895
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:11,490
they,

896
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,323
uh,

897
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:13,880
hate below jobs.

898
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,940
I hate to,

899
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,710
I don't even want to
be tagged those teeth.

900
00:23:18,711 --> 00:23:19,041
Good.

901
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:19,874
Perfect.

902
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,350
You read my girl.

903
00:23:21,351 --> 00:23:22,910
I don't know if you guys
can find a picture of that,

904
00:23:22,911 --> 00:23:23,121
but,

905
00:23:23,121 --> 00:23:23,390
uh,

906
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:23,691
it's,

907
00:23:23,691 --> 00:23:23,900
uh,

908
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,680
pretty,

909
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,330
pretty crazy looking whenever a smile,

910
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,350
there's a lot of,

911
00:23:27,351 --> 00:23:27,710
um,

912
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:28,810
strange things that,

913
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:29,630
wow,

914
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:30,231
oh my God.

915
00:23:30,231 --> 00:23:33,890
That African people do
to customize their body.

916
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,540
The neck rings.

917
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,130
That's very strange.

918
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,410
The stretching of the lower lip.

919
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,860
Serie a women do the,

920
00:23:42,861 --> 00:23:44,570
they put a plate in their lower lip.

921
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,290
Yeah.

922
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:45,910
Well the,

923
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:46,970
the Masi they do,

924
00:23:46,971 --> 00:23:51,410
they're a big gauges in their ears and
whenever they get so big that they start

925
00:23:51,411 --> 00:23:52,041
flopping around,

926
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:54,410
I've actually been brought into that.

927
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:56,210
So the pygmy tribe
brought me in his family.

928
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:56,721
Uh,

929
00:23:56,721 --> 00:24:00,800
the Masai tribe had a ceremony and made
me a warrior and they painted me red

930
00:24:00,801 --> 00:24:01,634
head to toe.

931
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:02,061
Um,

932
00:24:02,061 --> 00:24:03,890
they gave me a spear
that killed two lions.

933
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:04,810
Whoa.

934
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:08,300
She's seen the main of the line
that it killed the head warrior,

935
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:08,840
you know,

936
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,621
gave me my name,

937
00:24:09,621 --> 00:24:10,454
which is Mizzou.

938
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:11,900
Simba Maasais Milan.

939
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,090
And that means though the white lion,

940
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,030
Masai warrior.

941
00:24:15,031 --> 00:24:16,970
So I'm a part of the warrior class,

942
00:24:16,971 --> 00:24:17,541
the Masa.

943
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:20,030
And whenever the wind blows with
them and there was big gauges,

944
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:20,840
um,

945
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,170
they'll just twist their ear loads and
then wrap them around the top of their

946
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:24,680
ear.

947
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,580
So it looks really funny.

948
00:24:25,581 --> 00:24:26,270
But uh,

949
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,380
but that's just on a windy day.

950
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,410
So they killed lions with spears.

951
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:34,430
Is it because the lions are attacking
them or just they just got to be gangster?

952
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:35,240
A little,

953
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,073
a little bit of both.

954
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:36,471
Really.

955
00:24:36,471 --> 00:24:38,570
I think the younger guys go
out there to impress the girls,

956
00:24:38,571 --> 00:24:38,751
but,

957
00:24:38,751 --> 00:24:38,990
uh,

958
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,480
to kill a fucking line with the speed,

959
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:41,970
their waiting,

960
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:42,803
just show your deck.

961
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:45,290
The,

962
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:45,561
the,

963
00:24:45,561 --> 00:24:46,280
uh,

964
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:46,850
the,

965
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:47,241
what is it?

966
00:24:47,241 --> 00:24:47,841
The guys,

967
00:24:47,841 --> 00:24:48,560
um,

968
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:48,711
oh,

969
00:24:48,711 --> 00:24:49,100
the,

970
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,120
they there.

971
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:50,921
Those are shepherds.

972
00:24:50,921 --> 00:24:53,210
So the pygmies are hunter and gatherers,

973
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:55,040
but the Masa or shepherds.

974
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:57,530
And so they take care of
different cattle and goats.

975
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,000
And so whenever they're doing that,

976
00:24:59,001 --> 00:24:59,930
they have to protect,

977
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:00,470
uh,

978
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,070
their herd.

979
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:03,080
And that's against lions and Jaguars,

980
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,930
cheetahs and leopards.

981
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:08,120
And so my spear,

982
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:11,420
they actually showed me the skin of the
leopard that it killed the main of the

983
00:25:11,421 --> 00:25:12,470
lion that had killed.

984
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:13,520
Um,

985
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,200
and he also said it killed a man.

986
00:25:15,201 --> 00:25:17,120
So I guess I have a murder weapon,

987
00:25:17,121 --> 00:25:18,290
but a holy shit.

988
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:18,531
Yeah.

989
00:25:18,531 --> 00:25:18,651
He,

990
00:25:18,651 --> 00:25:20,360
but he was protecting their cattle.

991
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:23,180
A thief came in there
and a actually came with,

992
00:25:23,181 --> 00:25:23,650
uh,

993
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:24,231
a room Goo,

994
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,064
which is a club.

995
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:25,850
Um,

996
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:27,680
and so it was a room Guo versus a spear.

997
00:25:27,681 --> 00:25:28,760
And it was a warrior.

998
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,930
So anyways,

999
00:25:29,931 --> 00:25:30,590
it's pretty,

1000
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:31,423
pretty crazy.

1001
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:31,940
Wow.

1002
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:32,541
What is it like,

1003
00:25:32,541 --> 00:25:33,860
what kind of a head does this thing,

1004
00:25:33,861 --> 00:25:34,694
the spearhead,

1005
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,280
the spearheads about this long.

1006
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,140
And it's heavy because I mean at all?

1007
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:39,651
Uh,

1008
00:25:39,651 --> 00:25:40,101
yeah,

1009
00:25:40,101 --> 00:25:41,600
actually they have this,

1010
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:42,171
uh,

1011
00:25:42,171 --> 00:25:47,150
the wood part of it in the middle of a
Maasai warrior spirit from like an olive

1012
00:25:47,151 --> 00:25:47,984
tree of some sort,

1013
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,780
and then they put it through
the fire and make it really,

1014
00:25:50,781 --> 00:25:51,291
really strong.

1015
00:25:51,291 --> 00:25:52,130
It's a hardwood anyway.

1016
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:52,410
Yeah,

1017
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:53,030
that's a hard way.

1018
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:53,341
And they,

1019
00:25:53,341 --> 00:25:53,630
they,

1020
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:56,300
they know how to treat it through
the fire and make it like rock solid.

1021
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,460
And then one end is almost like,

1022
00:25:58,461 --> 00:25:59,390
it looks like a javelin.

1023
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:02,210
And so that's the end that they use for
either target practice or just sticking

1024
00:26:02,211 --> 00:26:04,460
it in the ground whenever they're
walking around and the other,

1025
00:26:04,461 --> 00:26:06,530
and they only use for whenever
they come across the line.

1026
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:07,760
Wow.

1027
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:09,050
So one end,

1028
00:26:09,051 --> 00:26:11,810
they throw it just to
like to just to practice.

1029
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:12,040
Yep.

1030
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:12,340
And,

1031
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:12,590
uh,

1032
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:16,460
we took some balloons over there
to see if the kids would like it.

1033
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,750
And to be honest,

1034
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,570
uh,

1035
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:18,820
the,

1036
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:21,920
the warriors liked the balloons better
than anything because we blow up those

1037
00:26:21,921 --> 00:26:23,420
balloons and just tie them,

1038
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:24,650
throw them on the ground,

1039
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:25,630
and then,

1040
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:25,940
uh,

1041
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,300
they would,

1042
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,840
the different warriors would stock
the balloons almost on every time.

1043
00:26:29,841 --> 00:26:31,010
Almost the first throw,

1044
00:26:31,011 --> 00:26:32,480
every single time they nailed it.

1045
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:33,563
How far away?

1046
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,311
Uh,

1047
00:26:34,311 --> 00:26:37,190
I mean not too far because
the wind's blowing in there.

1048
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,740
They're stocking it and whenever
they're going after a lion,

1049
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:42,200
they normally wait until they're
close because if they miss,

1050
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:43,130
they,

1051
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:43,963
they,

1052
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,810
they wait until it's close.

1053
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:46,921
And so,

1054
00:26:46,921 --> 00:26:47,191
I mean,

1055
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:48,140
probably here to the door,

1056
00:26:48,141 --> 00:26:50,280
me and only like 20 feet.

1057
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:50,520
Oh,

1058
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:50,601
well,

1059
00:26:50,601 --> 00:26:53,880
I guess some of them did it farther where
some were getting it from all the way

1060
00:26:53,881 --> 00:26:54,510
to the,

1061
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,343
to the window.

1062
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:57,140
So some of them could actually
throw him pretty good and for,

1063
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:59,580
sometimes they get jacked when
they go after these lines.

1064
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:00,481
Oh yeah.

1065
00:27:00,481 --> 00:27:00,751
The,

1066
00:27:00,751 --> 00:27:01,051
the,

1067
00:27:01,051 --> 00:27:01,620
the,

1068
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,820
the spear that I have,

1069
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:04,643
um,

1070
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,480
the guy that's the warrior
that gave it to me,

1071
00:27:06,481 --> 00:27:09,180
it seems almost like it's
like most is his name.

1072
00:27:09,181 --> 00:27:12,540
It's like most and the other warrior
mean I'm slipping on his name.

1073
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:13,230
Uh,

1074
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:16,440
but I took a picture of both of
them in the one guy that I met,

1075
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,640
he had this,

1076
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,040
these teeth marks out of his,

1077
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:20,371
uh,

1078
00:27:20,371 --> 00:27:21,090
his knee.

1079
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:21,840
He's kneecap.

1080
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,061
He,

1081
00:27:22,061 --> 00:27:23,430
he had a big room Goo,

1082
00:27:23,431 --> 00:27:24,121
which is a club,

1083
00:27:24,121 --> 00:27:24,954
but it was,

1084
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,850
it was like a walking stick for him.

1085
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:27,920
And,

1086
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,200
uh,

1087
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,410
his knee was really swollen and
it had these chunks out of it.

1088
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:32,071
And then,

1089
00:27:32,071 --> 00:27:32,550
um,

1090
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:32,881
we,

1091
00:27:32,881 --> 00:27:33,714
uh,

1092
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:36,750
I asked him what happened to his
knee and then he pulled over.

1093
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,930
They always wear red because that way
if they're ever wounded in battle or

1094
00:27:39,931 --> 00:27:40,591
anything hits them,

1095
00:27:40,591 --> 00:27:41,190
they,

1096
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,330
you don't know that they're bleeding.

1097
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,640
And so he pulled down his,

1098
00:27:44,641 --> 00:27:44,910
uh,

1099
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:45,570
his Shuka,

1100
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:47,910
which is like a robe of
sort for the warrior class.

1101
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,360
And he pulled it down and down his
shoulder blade and the back of his like

1102
00:27:51,361 --> 00:27:52,194
shoulder.

1103
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,430
He had claw marks,

1104
00:27:53,431 --> 00:27:53,611
I mean,

1105
00:27:53,611 --> 00:27:55,050
just wicked claw marks.

1106
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,183
And so the,

1107
00:27:56,270 --> 00:28:01,270
the lion had attached onto a shoulder
on to his thigh and then bid into his

1108
00:28:01,321 --> 00:28:02,154
knee.

1109
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,570
They showed me the scars

1110
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:10,290
and the w the head warrior is the one
that saved the other warrior and that's

1111
00:28:10,531 --> 00:28:12,420
the spear that I have
hanging up at my house.

1112
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:12,871
Wow.

1113
00:28:12,871 --> 00:28:14,820
So as the line was biting him,

1114
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:18,660
homeboy jacked him with the spirit that
came after this one that wasn't even on

1115
00:28:18,661 --> 00:28:19,380
a lion hunt.

1116
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,071
This was just,

1117
00:28:20,071 --> 00:28:21,330
they were going after,

1118
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,160
uh,

1119
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,060
or they were tending the fields,

1120
00:28:24,061 --> 00:28:27,920
tending the flock and aligned
came after the guy to fuck cats.

1121
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,040
That's all I have to say.

1122
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,930
And I'm more of a dog guy.

1123
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:31,410
Yeah.

1124
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:32,760
I'm way more of a dog guy.

1125
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,121
I,

1126
00:28:33,121 --> 00:28:33,441
uh,

1127
00:28:33,441 --> 00:28:34,840
I have chickens right now.

1128
00:28:34,841 --> 00:28:36,330
It just got a little baby chicks.

1129
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,080
That's awesome.

1130
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:37,913
My little girl,

1131
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,780
they wanted to get chicken,

1132
00:28:39,781 --> 00:28:43,200
so we decided to get like a little
chicken coop sort of a situation.

1133
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:44,070
Um,

1134
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,840
but the fucking cat,

1135
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,270
I have two cats and my one cat,

1136
00:28:48,271 --> 00:28:51,840
this motherfucker just paces in front
of that door and laughed and Ryan,

1137
00:28:51,841 --> 00:28:53,730
and it doesn't matter if he's trained,

1138
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:57,660
it doesn't matter if he's sweet nippers
he can't wait to murder one of those

1139
00:28:57,661 --> 00:28:58,260
birds.

1140
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,910
He just can't get it out of his head.

1141
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,020
Like in his head.

1142
00:29:01,021 --> 00:29:02,160
He's got to get in there and fit.

1143
00:29:02,161 --> 00:29:02,994
He hears them.

1144
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,470
He sits out in front of the dorm,

1145
00:29:04,471 --> 00:29:05,880
the owls and you know,

1146
00:29:05,881 --> 00:29:06,061
it's,

1147
00:29:06,061 --> 00:29:07,830
it's almost like you want to kick his ass.

1148
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:08,311
He like,

1149
00:29:08,311 --> 00:29:09,144
come on man,

1150
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,440
why don't you fucking leave them alone?

1151
00:29:10,441 --> 00:29:11,274
They're little chicks,

1152
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,950
but in his DNA there was
just no stopping that.

1153
00:29:13,951 --> 00:29:15,030
That's what he wants to do.

1154
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:15,960
Yep.

1155
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,800
Have you ever seen a live?

1156
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:17,520
Uh,

1157
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:17,850
yeah,

1158
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:18,100
I,

1159
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:18,540
I've just seen,

1160
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,580
I've seen a two different times.

1161
00:29:20,581 --> 00:29:24,060
I've seen two and a one time
they were sitting over a,

1162
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:26,490
it was either Cape Buffalo or a,

1163
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:27,481
what is it,

1164
00:29:27,481 --> 00:29:29,910
a water buffalo water buffalo.

1165
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,890
I think it was a water buffalo and uh,

1166
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:36,180
it was still chomping down on that and
so it wasn't paying attention to us.

1167
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,730
I had my spear though and I did,

1168
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,850
but I wasn't going to test it out.

1169
00:29:38,851 --> 00:29:40,650
Like some guys are
trying to go over there,

1170
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:42,040
have practiced with it.

1171
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,060
I have practice with it,

1172
00:29:43,061 --> 00:29:44,080
but I'm not going to use it man.

1173
00:29:44,081 --> 00:29:44,261
Like,

1174
00:29:44,261 --> 00:29:44,700
I'm not,

1175
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,360
I'm not what they already gave me,

1176
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,020
uh,

1177
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,460
the ceremony and gave me the spear,

1178
00:29:48,461 --> 00:29:49,300
made me a warrior.

1179
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:49,901
In fact,

1180
00:29:49,901 --> 00:29:50,530
the other ones,

1181
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:53,350
they can't be a warrior
until they kill a lion.

1182
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:56,770
So they come back with the
female tail a waving it in.

1183
00:29:56,771 --> 00:29:57,341
If it's a male,

1184
00:29:57,341 --> 00:29:58,230
they come back with a law.

1185
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,620
The main wrapped around them.

1186
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:01,523
Yeah.

1187
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:05,950
You got to be a w two w you have
to be Elian killer to be a warrior.

1188
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:06,430
Yeah.

1189
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,570
Oh my goodness.

1190
00:30:07,571 --> 00:30:07,780
Yeah.

1191
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,411
Until then,

1192
00:30:08,411 --> 00:30:09,850
you're kind of a lesser class.

1193
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:15,140
A male should bring a blue
state policies in this country.

1194
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:15,760
Yeah.

1195
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,900
So I thought I was a warrior.

1196
00:30:16,901 --> 00:30:18,370
That's what I tried to connect with them,

1197
00:30:18,371 --> 00:30:18,581
you know.

1198
00:30:18,581 --> 00:30:18,881
Hey,

1199
00:30:18,881 --> 00:30:19,390
I fought.

1200
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:19,730
We,

1201
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:20,563
they wrestle.

1202
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:21,970
They just do take downs though.

1203
00:30:21,971 --> 00:30:24,430
They don't do any like ground
fight and you show them some moves.

1204
00:30:24,431 --> 00:30:24,911
I did.

1205
00:30:24,911 --> 00:30:25,241
I did.

1206
00:30:25,241 --> 00:30:27,540
I wrestled two at the same
time and picked them both up.

1207
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:28,840
Uh,

1208
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,630
so they thought that's how they thought
I was a warrior because they were like,

1209
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:32,100
oh wow.

1210
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:32,681
As wrestling,

1211
00:30:32,681 --> 00:30:33,570
like we can't dot.

1212
00:30:33,571 --> 00:30:34,630
You had a line of them.

1213
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:35,670
Did you submit anybody?

1214
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:36,140
Uh,

1215
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,660
you try to teach them at a tap man?

1216
00:30:37,661 --> 00:30:37,961
No.

1217
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:38,710
Uh,

1218
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:39,340
for me,

1219
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,320
I would just pick them up
and put him over my shoulder.

1220
00:30:41,321 --> 00:30:42,940
I did that with both of
them at the same time.

1221
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:43,910
Wants to do what you got to remember.

1222
00:30:43,911 --> 00:30:44,091
They're,

1223
00:30:44,091 --> 00:30:45,670
they're skinny skinny dudes.

1224
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:49,300
I did start to put one
in a guillotine choke,

1225
00:30:49,301 --> 00:30:50,140
but then I started thinking,

1226
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:50,351
man,

1227
00:30:50,351 --> 00:30:51,280
this guy killed a lion.

1228
00:30:51,281 --> 00:30:52,120
He's not going to tap.

1229
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:52,500
Right.

1230
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:52,970
You know,

1231
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:53,630
so I'm like,

1232
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:54,910
I'm not going to hurt this guy.

1233
00:30:54,911 --> 00:30:56,260
I'm just going to play around with them.

1234
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,090
So is he trying to wrestle with you?

1235
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:58,400
Oh yeah.

1236
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,460
They have figured out your sprawl.

1237
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:00,940
Yeah.

1238
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,830
Get doubled under hooks.

1239
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,081
You're like,

1240
00:31:02,081 --> 00:31:02,901
what is he doing?

1241
00:31:02,901 --> 00:31:06,700
And they trying a couple of different
kinds of like colored ties and trips and

1242
00:31:06,701 --> 00:31:07,750
then they do like a double,

1243
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,480
almost like a Thai clinch real.

1244
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:09,660
Uh,

1245
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,470
and so they do that and
they just kind of like,

1246
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,040
um,

1247
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:16,180
circle each other and they just
do that amongst the warrior class.

1248
00:31:16,181 --> 00:31:16,870
Just a,

1249
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:18,670
almost like a ranking system of sorts.

1250
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:19,271
So,

1251
00:31:19,271 --> 00:31:19,530
uh,

1252
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:22,510
but you should be able to go in there
and school those dudes and why when it

1253
00:31:22,511 --> 00:31:23,120
came to wrestle,

1254
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,940
create a whole elite team.

1255
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:25,600
Yeah.

1256
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,920
Masai warriors,

1257
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,240
Kenyan wrestling team.

1258
00:31:28,241 --> 00:31:29,170
That'd be pretty crazy.

1259
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:33,370
It's like you could be like
your own Sandra Bullock movie.

1260
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,140
A white guy goes over there,

1261
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,790
teaches them how to wrestle,

1262
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,530
brings him into the state championship.

1263
00:31:38,531 --> 00:31:39,880
They got leaves for shoes,

1264
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:43,211
teach him.

1265
00:31:43,211 --> 00:31:45,160
And Cy had a fucking tap people,

1266
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,590
they probably don't understand this,

1267
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,940
like probably so many different
techniques you can use.

1268
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:49,180
I don't,

1269
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:49,950
they don't see comment.

1270
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:50,160
Right?

1271
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:50,410
Yeah.

1272
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:51,570
But the craziest thing is,

1273
00:31:51,571 --> 00:31:55,120
is that they have all these cactuses
and briar bushes all around.

1274
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,160
So inside the village,

1275
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,180
the wrestling was,

1276
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:58,841
was okay,

1277
00:31:58,841 --> 00:32:00,160
but it was just,

1278
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,210
it would happen anywhere.

1279
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:02,044
And anytime.

1280
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:02,951
I remember I had those,

1281
00:32:02,951 --> 00:32:06,730
a five finger shoes on and I stepped
right on a briar Bush and it went straight

1282
00:32:06,731 --> 00:32:08,410
through the soul of it and into my toe.

1283
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,071
And,

1284
00:32:09,071 --> 00:32:09,400
uh,

1285
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:09,671
I mean,

1286
00:32:09,671 --> 00:32:10,180
just,

1287
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:10,511
I'm like,

1288
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:10,991
come on guys,

1289
00:32:10,991 --> 00:32:12,250
let's at least were you,

1290
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:12,490
uh,

1291
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:12,840
you know,

1292
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,870
so you just said it like,

1293
00:32:13,871 --> 00:32:14,351
where do you used to?

1294
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:15,520
The mats were used to the,

1295
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,713
to the sissy stuff.

1296
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,970
And so those guys are just,

1297
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,350
they're worried be barefoot too,

1298
00:32:20,351 --> 00:32:20,680
right?

1299
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,100
Yeah,

1300
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:21,850
they're barefoot.

1301
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:22,720
I got shoes on,

1302
00:32:22,721 --> 00:32:23,050
I got,

1303
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:24,220
I got hiking boots on.

1304
00:32:24,221 --> 00:32:25,040
I have,

1305
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:25,840
I have everything.

1306
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,880
So when they step on a briar
Bush and they're barefoot,

1307
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:29,070
they just walk it off.

1308
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,161
I don't know.

1309
00:32:30,161 --> 00:32:30,461
I didn't,

1310
00:32:30,461 --> 00:32:30,820
I didn't,

1311
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,050
I guess I'm the only one,

1312
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,220
even while we're wrestling,

1313
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:37,090
I'm not aware enough to know there's a
briar Bush around or herself ridiculously

1314
00:32:37,091 --> 00:32:37,940
tough feet too,

1315
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,520
especially with the pygmies,

1316
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:41,660
the Masi too.

1317
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,490
But a lot of the,

1318
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:46,130
I now are getting a
sandals made out of tires,

1319
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,420
so like tires at blowout,

1320
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:48,890
they'll uh,

1321
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:49,711
they'll make it out of the,

1322
00:32:49,711 --> 00:32:50,930
the rubber from the tire.

1323
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,670
But the pygmies,

1324
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:54,710
they don't have access to stuff like that,

1325
00:32:54,711 --> 00:32:57,470
especially because they don't have
anything to bargain or barter with.

1326
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:58,461
They don't have goats,

1327
00:32:58,461 --> 00:33:00,770
they don't have cows and their slaves.

1328
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:04,160
So they are mostly barefoot all the time
in the running through the jungle and

1329
00:33:04,161 --> 00:33:04,761
stuff like that.

1330
00:33:04,761 --> 00:33:08,930
And so they're the soles of their feet
actually almost like the soles of shoes

1331
00:33:08,931 --> 00:33:09,291
almost.

1332
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:09,501
I mean,

1333
00:33:09,501 --> 00:33:10,190
not,

1334
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:10,401
not,

1335
00:33:10,401 --> 00:33:10,611
I mean,

1336
00:33:10,611 --> 00:33:11,150
they don't have the,

1337
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:12,350
the gripping and stuff and,

1338
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:12,980
but uh,

1339
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:13,670
but they're thick.

1340
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:14,360
They're really thick.

1341
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,480
Have you ever seen that studies
show where there's two dudes,

1342
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:20,870
I think they call it dual survivor
or something like dual survivor?

1343
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,610
I don't remember the Cody.

1344
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,720
Cody a Landon or Landauer's,

1345
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,340
I dunno.

1346
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,660
Whatever homeboy's name is pig tails.

1347
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,320
Yeah.

1348
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:28,630
Yeah.

1349
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:29,420
He's got pigtails,

1350
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:32,870
big gorilla looking dude
doesn't cold weather snow,

1351
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,640
I mean berries and stuff everywhere.

1352
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:38,090
I saw the one and because I'm trying
to learn from those guys some survival

1353
00:33:38,091 --> 00:33:38,361
stuff,

1354
00:33:38,361 --> 00:33:40,040
which the pygmies no more than anybody,

1355
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:41,070
but um,

1356
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:41,810
while I'm here,

1357
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:42,051
you know,

1358
00:33:42,051 --> 00:33:46,310
learning from that show and they did
like the swamps of Louisiana or something

1359
00:33:46,311 --> 00:33:50,300
and there's all these water moccasins
and all this stuff and he's barefoot and

1360
00:33:50,301 --> 00:33:50,880
there he,

1361
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,150
he's walking through and poisons fighters.

1362
00:33:53,151 --> 00:33:55,370
And first time I saw
him scared like he was,

1363
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,900
he was terrified walking through that.

1364
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:57,441
Yeah.

1365
00:33:57,441 --> 00:34:00,740
One bite from one of those crazy fucking
animals that live down there and you're

1366
00:34:00,741 --> 00:34:01,330
done.

1367
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,170
You got a lot of that
in the Congo as well.

1368
00:34:03,171 --> 00:34:06,230
I've watched some documentaries in the
Congo and then there's the only place in

1369
00:34:06,231 --> 00:34:08,540
the world when they have
spiders that move in packs.

1370
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:08,711
No.

1371
00:34:08,711 --> 00:34:09,070
Yeah,

1372
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:09,350
yeah.

1373
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:09,681
And then,

1374
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:10,250
uh,

1375
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,330
their aunts manner,

1376
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:12,223
pretty crazy.

1377
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,370
My buddy I took with me,

1378
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:13,760
um,

1379
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,450
he went to take a dump
behind a tree and he put his,

1380
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:22,690
he put his back against the tree and he
had these ants crawl up and just start

1381
00:34:22,911 --> 00:34:23,744
biting them.

1382
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,020
Uh,

1383
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,280
like these ants though,

1384
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:26,301
make you bleed.

1385
00:34:26,301 --> 00:34:26,551
They're,

1386
00:34:26,551 --> 00:34:27,530
they're chompers on him.

1387
00:34:27,531 --> 00:34:28,364
Like literally,

1388
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,473
um,

1389
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:30,140
what's,

1390
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:33,380
what's the most brutal part is they
tried to find the softest spot to bite or

1391
00:34:33,381 --> 00:34:33,681
something,

1392
00:34:33,681 --> 00:34:33,861
they,

1393
00:34:33,861 --> 00:34:34,880
with their sensors.

1394
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,710
And so whenever they came up my,

1395
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:37,563
my leg,

1396
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,300
uh,

1397
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,520
I didn't notice them
because how fast they are.

1398
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:40,791
Uh,

1399
00:34:40,791 --> 00:34:43,730
I didn't notice them until
two were on my left nipple.

1400
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,560
And I was like pulling this thing off.

1401
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,131
And I mean,

1402
00:34:46,131 --> 00:34:48,050
I'm having to pull the aunt out.

1403
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:49,820
And whenever I finally got it off,

1404
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:50,960
I literally was bleeding.

1405
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:51,770
Um,

1406
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:53,800
like just from a fucking aunt.

1407
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:54,081
Yeah.

1408
00:34:54,081 --> 00:34:55,340
And they travel in these things,

1409
00:34:55,341 --> 00:34:56,151
like I'm talking about.

1410
00:34:56,151 --> 00:34:57,110
They like roads.

1411
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:58,370
So sometimes the,

1412
00:34:58,450 --> 00:34:59,930
the path that you're walking on,

1413
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:00,920
if it's a pygmy path,

1414
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:01,820
they're small.

1415
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,121
Really,

1416
00:35:02,121 --> 00:35:02,954
really small.

1417
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,093
Sometimes the,

1418
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:04,810
the,

1419
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,830
it's wider than the path of ants.

1420
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:07,451
Like a,

1421
00:35:07,451 --> 00:35:08,480
I mean like a road,

1422
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,160
a road of ants like this thick.

1423
00:35:10,161 --> 00:35:10,990
And I mean the,

1424
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:11,960
the answer when like this,

1425
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,580
this long and about an inch long.

1426
00:35:13,581 --> 00:35:13,701
Yeah.

1427
00:35:13,701 --> 00:35:17,800
But there's millions of them that
they make these roads that are wide.

1428
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,870
They answered goddamn terrifying.

1429
00:35:19,871 --> 00:35:20,200
Yeah.

1430
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,830
And even really are Brian Callum,

1431
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:23,600
a good buddy of mine was working,

1432
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,950
I think in Borneo.

1433
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:25,820
I think you said it was,

1434
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,691
I forget where it was.

1435
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:27,680
It was in some jungle,

1436
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:30,140
but he said they would
have to pose it in Congo.

1437
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:30,700
No,

1438
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,490
no.

1439
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:35,160
But they had to put Turpentine
over the posts of the,

1440
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:38,940
they had a suspended tents put turpentine
over the posts of the aunts didn't

1441
00:35:38,941 --> 00:35:39,774
climb up them.

1442
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,081
He said,

1443
00:35:40,081 --> 00:35:40,171
well,

1444
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:41,430
when you were lying in bed at night,

1445
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:43,710
you would hear the ants
walking through the forest.

1446
00:35:43,711 --> 00:35:44,490
Yeah,

1447
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:45,260
absolutely.

1448
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,093
We can to them.

1449
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:47,003
You can hear him.

1450
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:48,220
Yeah.

1451
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,890
I mean that's the part,

1452
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:50,110
see,

1453
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:50,490
that's,

1454
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:54,120
that's why I know I'm passionate about
this and that I really feel like this is

1455
00:35:54,121 --> 00:35:55,950
my life's purpose because I don't,

1456
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:57,120
I don't like creepy crawlies.

1457
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,800
I don't like stuff like that man.

1458
00:35:59,120 --> 00:35:59,381
And,

1459
00:35:59,381 --> 00:35:59,480
uh,

1460
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,740
I think I sent a picture of a black Mamba.

1461
00:36:01,741 --> 00:36:03,150
I almost stepped on a,

1462
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,490
and luckily the pygmies killed it.

1463
00:36:04,491 --> 00:36:05,324
It was an angel.

1464
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,593
And uh,

1465
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,753
and it was,

1466
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:10,050
it was pretty crazy because
all of a sudden I heard,

1467
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:12,060
I heard the hut next to me,

1468
00:36:12,061 --> 00:36:14,370
which at this tribe was a chief and,

1469
00:36:14,371 --> 00:36:14,610
uh,

1470
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:17,280
I heard his wife going nuts
and I would sleep with a,

1471
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:18,850
I would actually sleep with the,

1472
00:36:18,851 --> 00:36:19,080
Yep.

1473
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:19,531
There it is.

1474
00:36:19,531 --> 00:36:21,680
That's the Black Mamba and um,

1475
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,530
that almost got you.

1476
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:22,801
Yeah.

1477
00:36:22,801 --> 00:36:25,050
It was like five or
six feet long probably.

1478
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,040
Did you guys eat that thing?

1479
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:26,760
See,

1480
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,581
I thought about it and they,

1481
00:36:27,581 --> 00:36:28,360
they,

1482
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:28,741
they see,

1483
00:36:28,741 --> 00:36:29,574
they believe,

1484
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:34,650
they believe trees and
snakes are their ancestors.

1485
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:36,990
And so even though they killed the snake,

1486
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,250
if it's a python,

1487
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,000
they won't kill it.

1488
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,833
They'll,

1489
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:40,950
they won't kill a python.

1490
00:36:40,951 --> 00:36:42,420
They'll drag it to where it's safe.

1491
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:46,560
The only python I've heard of them killing
was whenever they had gone fishing.

1492
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:48,960
And then they had it almost
on like a stringer of sorts.

1493
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,870
And then a big python came
by and took their fish.

1494
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,880
And then the guy was so
mad he killed that python.

1495
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:54,510
Um,

1496
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:56,820
but the pygmies were mad at
him for killing a python,

1497
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:57,390
uh,

1498
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:58,360
because they aren't poisonous.

1499
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,191
But the black Mambas,

1500
00:36:59,191 --> 00:37:00,240
they know how dangerous they are.

1501
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:01,111
I think it's like 20,

1502
00:37:01,111 --> 00:37:02,820
30 minutes and you're gone.

1503
00:37:02,821 --> 00:37:05,280
And those things can get up
to like eight or 10 feet long.

1504
00:37:05,281 --> 00:37:07,110
And then the fastest snake in the world,

1505
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,730
one of the most venomous,

1506
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,750
so fastest,

1507
00:37:09,751 --> 00:37:10,620
most aggressive,

1508
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:11,940
one of the longest.

1509
00:37:11,941 --> 00:37:12,774
And uh,

1510
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:14,340
so it just seems like Congo man,

1511
00:37:14,341 --> 00:37:15,061
like everything,

1512
00:37:15,061 --> 00:37:17,490
there's some of the most
beautiful places in the world.

1513
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:17,731
I mean,

1514
00:37:17,731 --> 00:37:20,640
the mountains covered on
the equator covered with,

1515
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:21,001
I mean,

1516
00:37:21,001 --> 00:37:22,470
the most gorgeous trees.

1517
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,470
A silver back gorilla is,

1518
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:24,721
I mean,

1519
00:37:24,721 --> 00:37:26,010
just some beautiful stuff there.

1520
00:37:26,011 --> 00:37:28,140
But there were some gorillas in the wild.

1521
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:28,351
No,

1522
00:37:28,351 --> 00:37:29,130
I haven't.

1523
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:29,560
I haven't,

1524
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,690
I think they said,

1525
00:37:30,691 --> 00:37:33,450
I've heard we've heard them and
we've heard definitely monkeys,

1526
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,460
but I haven't seen the guerrillas.

1527
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:36,360
Have you seen monkeys?

1528
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:37,050
Oh yeah.

1529
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:37,350
Oh yeah.

1530
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:37,630
A lot.

1531
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:37,890
Like,

1532
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:38,131
yeah,

1533
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:39,240
it's the Mohs cy,

1534
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,171
not the pygmies,

1535
00:37:40,171 --> 00:37:40,751
but the Masa.

1536
00:37:40,751 --> 00:37:43,110
I actually will target
practice with their room.

1537
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:43,943
Goos their clubs.

1538
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,570
They'll throw those at the monkeys.

1539
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,830
And so poor monkeys,

1540
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:48,990
the monkeys get no fucking slack.

1541
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:50,400
It's just like the pygmies,

1542
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:51,001
pygmies,

1543
00:37:51,001 --> 00:37:51,750
the monkeys,

1544
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:52,980
the little guys get picked on.

1545
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:53,491
Yeah.

1546
00:37:53,491 --> 00:37:54,360
And I actually,

1547
00:37:54,361 --> 00:37:54,601
that,

1548
00:37:54,601 --> 00:37:55,020
that,

1549
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:55,250
uh,

1550
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:56,490
Black Mamba that was up there,

1551
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:58,200
I heard them going nuts.

1552
00:37:58,201 --> 00:38:01,450
And so whenever I got up
and I crawl out of my hut,

1553
00:38:01,451 --> 00:38:01,520
so,

1554
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,161
which I mean,

1555
00:38:02,161 --> 00:38:03,540
those things for me to get inside,

1556
00:38:03,541 --> 00:38:05,070
sometimes I have to be on my elbows.

1557
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,790
And so I start getting
out of it and I'm like,

1558
00:38:08,791 --> 00:38:09,571
what's going on?

1559
00:38:09,571 --> 00:38:11,050
And I had a video of it and uh,

1560
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,760
I should cut it off right
before I asked the question,

1561
00:38:14,761 --> 00:38:16,110
but I didn't know what
kind of snake it was.

1562
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,970
I thought Black Mambas were black,

1563
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,900
like just black.

1564
00:38:18,901 --> 00:38:20,940
But it's actually their mouths
when they open their mouths.

1565
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,100
It's like pitch black inside their mouth,

1566
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:23,550
even.

1567
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:23,851
They're like,

1568
00:38:23,851 --> 00:38:24,684
teeth are black.

1569
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:25,531
And so,

1570
00:38:25,531 --> 00:38:25,950
um,

1571
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:28,320
that's how they got their
name Black Mambas and so,

1572
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,370
uh,

1573
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:29,941
but they're,

1574
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:32,790
they're gray on top and
then white on their belly.

1575
00:38:32,791 --> 00:38:34,830
And so I didn't think it
was a black Mamba at all.

1576
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,220
And so I was,

1577
00:38:36,221 --> 00:38:37,054
uh,

1578
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:37,330
I,

1579
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:37,511
yeah,

1580
00:38:37,511 --> 00:38:41,410
I was getting out of my hut and then I
got slapped in the belly a and stopped

1581
00:38:41,411 --> 00:38:44,080
and I didn't know what was going on until
I got my phone on because it's pitch

1582
00:38:44,081 --> 00:38:44,914
black.

1583
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:46,061
Yeah,

1584
00:38:46,061 --> 00:38:46,330
man,

1585
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:49,540
that's the thing I almost stepped on and
it's like 20 or 30 minutes and you're

1586
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:49,940
dead.

1587
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:50,320
Oh,

1588
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,890
what a creepy look in alien,

1589
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:52,571
like creature.

1590
00:38:52,571 --> 00:38:57,070
They had only hit it in the back of
the tail and so it was still slithering

1591
00:38:57,071 --> 00:38:57,660
around.

1592
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,061
Actually,

1593
00:38:58,061 --> 00:38:58,540
I'll pull up.

1594
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:58,920
Wow.

1595
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,640
I don't think I uploaded it to anywhere,

1596
00:39:00,641 --> 00:39:01,570
but maybe my phone.

1597
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:06,610
So they won't eat these even though
it's a source of protein hungry?

1598
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,000
Nope,

1599
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,320
not at all edible though.

1600
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:09,243
Black Mama.

1601
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:11,160
I don't know about bike mama's.

1602
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:13,060
I know that the pythons are,

1603
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:13,600
uh,

1604
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,670
rattlesnakes are actually pretty tasty.

1605
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:16,091
Yeah,

1606
00:39:16,091 --> 00:39:16,421
I think,

1607
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:18,580
I think if you cut it off far enough,

1608
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:20,590
far enough down from its head,

1609
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:21,970
then I bet it wouldn't be poisoned us,

1610
00:39:21,971 --> 00:39:23,590
but they weren't going to eat it all,

1611
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,993
huh?

1612
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:25,211
Yeah.

1613
00:39:25,211 --> 00:39:25,571
And then I,

1614
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,730
I asked on the right before this video,

1615
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:28,210
uh,

1616
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:28,751
cuts off.

1617
00:39:28,751 --> 00:39:29,381
I ask if,

1618
00:39:29,381 --> 00:39:29,710
uh,

1619
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:31,690
if it's poisonous and so,

1620
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:32,771
yeah.

1621
00:39:32,771 --> 00:39:33,640
I don't know if I can,

1622
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:36,050
if I can email the sows or Pete.

1623
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:40,570
Pretty much everybody there must know
somebody who's been killed by something

1624
00:39:40,571 --> 00:39:41,890
natural in that area.

1625
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:42,340
Oh yeah.

1626
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:46,930
Whether it's a crocodile or whether
it's a lion or whether it's whatever the

1627
00:39:46,931 --> 00:39:47,830
hell else is out there.

1628
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:48,080
Yeah.

1629
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:48,241
The,

1630
00:39:48,241 --> 00:39:51,370
the rivers close to the pygmies
are full of crocodiles and hippos.

1631
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,710
So crocodiles and hippos
live in the same thing.

1632
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:54,590
Oh,

1633
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,151
pumps too,

1634
00:39:55,151 --> 00:39:55,481
man.

1635
00:39:55,481 --> 00:39:56,231
That's another problem,

1636
00:39:56,231 --> 00:39:56,610
right.

1637
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:58,720
Only hippos kill more people
leaving than crocodiles.

1638
00:39:58,750 --> 00:39:58,961
Yeah.

1639
00:39:58,961 --> 00:39:59,710
A lot more.

1640
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:04,000
I got a video of a hippos and crocodiles
all in the same water hole and the

1641
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:04,361
hippos,

1642
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:07,660
we'll like swimming right next to the
crocodiles and they don't give a fuck

1643
00:40:07,661 --> 00:40:10,090
about the crocodiles and
they remotely concerned.

1644
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:10,850
I don't think,

1645
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:12,940
I don't think hippos are
concerned about anything.

1646
00:40:12,941 --> 00:40:13,631
And I don't know if you know that,

1647
00:40:13,631 --> 00:40:14,980
but they do like a bark.

1648
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,500
I mean it literally sounds
like they're barking.

1649
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:18,423
Um,

1650
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,540
like a softer bark.

1651
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:20,403
Not so like,

1652
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:21,251
like doggish,

1653
00:40:21,251 --> 00:40:24,580
but it sounds like a bark and that's
how hippos like communicate and stuff.

1654
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:28,510
And so like in the morning
and in the afternoon,

1655
00:40:28,511 --> 00:40:30,880
like towards like the
sunsetting and sun coming up,

1656
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,650
the hippos are barking.

1657
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,730
And so you hear that and
hear a little leave house.

1658
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:37,390
Yeah.

1659
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:40,150
And you hear these murderous giant pigs.

1660
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:40,660
Yeah.

1661
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:44,770
They're like thinking like a pig or
cousin to a pig or some shit like that.

1662
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,580
Probably.

1663
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,110
Yeah,

1664
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:46,670
I think,

1665
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:47,330
I think,

1666
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:48,163
I think,

1667
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:50,680
and I think there's
even like pygmy hippos.

1668
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:51,101
So,

1669
00:40:51,101 --> 00:40:51,550
uh,

1670
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:54,070
like pygmy hippos picked me crocodiles,

1671
00:40:54,071 --> 00:40:55,210
pygmy monkeys,

1672
00:40:55,211 --> 00:40:56,680
which are like the size of your finger.

1673
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:57,910
Um,

1674
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:58,391
like my,

1675
00:40:58,391 --> 00:41:01,660
like actual monkeys that are like
donkeys and size of your finger.

1676
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:05,320
Are you anywhere near
that area of the Congo?

1677
00:41:05,321 --> 00:41:05,530
A,

1678
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:06,940
I think it's called [inaudible].

1679
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,673
Do you know where that is?

1680
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:10,420
Bili Bi Loi.

1681
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,690
Benny is really close be in,

1682
00:41:13,691 --> 00:41:14,920
I know that Zoe,

1683
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:18,910
I don't have if ever heard of a that
chimpanzee that they found there.

1684
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:19,301
Oh,

1685
00:41:19,301 --> 00:41:20,530
the one that's supposed to be massive.

1686
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:21,700
Uh,

1687
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,180
the,

1688
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:24,640
I've heard stories from the
pygmies talking about a,

1689
00:41:24,641 --> 00:41:25,060
uh,

1690
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:28,000
a like human type monk and not human type.

1691
00:41:28,001 --> 00:41:29,170
They weren't talking about like big foot.

1692
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:29,801
And if they were,

1693
00:41:29,801 --> 00:41:30,700
I guess they were talking about me,

1694
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:32,451
but no,

1695
00:41:32,451 --> 00:41:32,620
they,

1696
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,000
they,

1697
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,790
they talk about,

1698
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:34,130
uh,

1699
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:35,470
different kinds of animals and,

1700
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,920
but they all start about this scene,

1701
00:41:36,921 --> 00:41:38,060
spirits and stuff like that.

1702
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:38,820
Right.

1703
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:39,800
But I mean,

1704
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:40,880
I've asked him about,

1705
00:41:40,881 --> 00:41:42,020
I forget what they call it.

1706
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,221
There's like an actual,

1707
00:41:43,221 --> 00:41:43,371
like,

1708
00:41:43,371 --> 00:41:44,810
Swahili name that they call that,

1709
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:45,620
uh,

1710
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,330
that potential dinosaur of sorts.

1711
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:52,090
It's friend David Choe actually went out
there looking for a long time ago for

1712
00:41:52,091 --> 00:41:52,900
vice,

1713
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:57,410
it went for vice.com and he went to look
in the Congo for like a brontosaurus.

1714
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:57,920
Wow.

1715
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,070
Well,

1716
00:41:58,070 --> 00:41:58,890
it's so crazy.

1717
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:00,200
It's like there's a saying,

1718
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:03,890
the Congo was called the
heart of darkness and uh,

1719
00:42:03,891 --> 00:42:06,080
on the dark continent and the like,

1720
00:42:06,081 --> 00:42:08,330
the pygmies I think are the ones
that have the saying that it's,

1721
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,850
I can't really say it
eloquent like they do,

1722
00:42:10,851 --> 00:42:11,990
but it's called a,

1723
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:12,890
it's,

1724
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:13,461
they say like,

1725
00:42:13,461 --> 00:42:17,660
it's basically hard for a fish to
navigate through the rivers because of how

1726
00:42:17,661 --> 00:42:19,100
thick everything is.

1727
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:19,940
Um,

1728
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:23,390
and it's just hiking
and everything is just,

1729
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:24,920
it's actually,

1730
00:42:24,921 --> 00:42:26,510
I guess better to be a pygmy because it's,

1731
00:42:26,511 --> 00:42:28,820
it's hard to move around,

1732
00:42:28,821 --> 00:42:31,220
especially whenever you have like
an 80 pound pack on your back.

1733
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:32,660
I'm trying to figure out how,

1734
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:33,980
how I'm going to go.

1735
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,780
I haven't sent this picture in,

1736
00:42:35,781 --> 00:42:36,620
but that's a,

1737
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:40,100
that's part of the ways that we get
through like 85 kilometers hiking and

1738
00:42:40,101 --> 00:42:40,811
styles.

1739
00:42:40,811 --> 00:42:41,840
So it's just so thick.

1740
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:42,420
Yeah.

1741
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:44,150
People tried some European,

1742
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:44,590
um,

1743
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:47,030
a nobleman tried to live there.

1744
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:50,450
They tried to settle into the Congo
because there's such a vast amount of

1745
00:42:50,451 --> 00:42:50,961
resources.

1746
00:42:50,961 --> 00:42:51,501
They just figured,

1747
00:42:51,501 --> 00:42:52,010
look,

1748
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:54,980
we'll just carve out a little
place and then make a house.

1749
00:42:54,981 --> 00:42:57,050
And the forest just swallowed it all up.

1750
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:58,730
They just couldn't keep off.

1751
00:42:58,820 --> 00:42:59,300
Yeah.

1752
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,860
I think in the 18,

1753
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:02,090
late 18 hundreds,

1754
00:43:02,091 --> 00:43:03,050
early 19 hundreds,

1755
00:43:03,051 --> 00:43:07,160
that was whenever they went there for
all the rubber and really slaughtered a

1756
00:43:07,161 --> 00:43:08,210
lot of the Congolese.

1757
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:08,810
And then,

1758
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:09,560
um,

1759
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:13,430
since then they came in for the golden
diamonds and now they're there for the

1760
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:14,331
Colton.

1761
00:43:14,331 --> 00:43:17,030
And you can go through
whole colonial like,

1762
00:43:17,031 --> 00:43:17,864
uh,

1763
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:19,940
like settlements that are from like,

1764
00:43:19,941 --> 00:43:20,340
uh,

1765
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,080
the,

1766
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,570
from Belgium and other places
that have settled there.

1767
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,790
And it's from like the early 19 hundreds,

1768
00:43:25,791 --> 00:43:26,570
and it's just,

1769
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:27,210
uh,

1770
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:28,430
almost like ghost towns.

1771
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:29,091
Um,

1772
00:43:29,091 --> 00:43:32,900
but they're like the Belgian colonization
stuff and nobody lives there.

1773
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:34,610
Like trees are growing up
through them and everything,

1774
00:43:34,611 --> 00:43:38,210
but they're brick buildings and the
Congolese don't live in brick buildings.

1775
00:43:38,211 --> 00:43:40,370
A lot of them don't unless
you're more towards the city.

1776
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:42,103
Wow.

1777
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:42,651
So,

1778
00:43:42,651 --> 00:43:42,980
um,

1779
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:44,600
these pygmies that you talked to,

1780
00:43:44,601 --> 00:43:46,970
had they seen that big giant chimpanzee

1781
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,393
at any of them?

1782
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:50,480
I don't know.

1783
00:43:50,481 --> 00:43:50,750
I,

1784
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:51,583
whenever I,

1785
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:55,430
I heard lots of different
stuff and normally they open
up around the campfire at

1786
00:43:55,431 --> 00:43:55,850
night.

1787
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:58,190
I would have to pretend
sometimes to go to sleep,

1788
00:43:58,570 --> 00:43:59,000
um,

1789
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,420
for the band to slave
masters or the kids to leave.

1790
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:06,440
And so Shalom University calls it Campfire
University for the pygmies because

1791
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,500
they'll open up and there'll
be real around the campfire.

1792
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:10,161
And,

1793
00:44:10,161 --> 00:44:10,341
uh,

1794
00:44:10,341 --> 00:44:11,031
they'll actually,

1795
00:44:11,031 --> 00:44:12,380
cause if I ask him in front of,

1796
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:13,510
I had a chief,

1797
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:13,770
uh,

1798
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:17,570
of the band to come to me and welcome me.

1799
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:18,201
It will.

1800
00:44:18,201 --> 00:44:18,771
First he was like,

1801
00:44:18,771 --> 00:44:19,970
what do you want with my people?

1802
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,440
What do you want with my property?

1803
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:22,430
Uh,

1804
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:23,660
and then he,

1805
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,370
and then I told him I
was just there to learn.

1806
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:25,731
Um,

1807
00:44:25,731 --> 00:44:27,540
I was with the university
where they're learning,

1808
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:29,650
doing research and just here to,

1809
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:30,800
to help and benefit.

1810
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:32,490
And then he gave me an egg.

1811
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,430
Um,

1812
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:34,650
he told me he had a gift for me.

1813
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:35,011
And,

1814
00:44:35,011 --> 00:44:35,161
uh,

1815
00:44:35,161 --> 00:44:36,930
so he gave me just one single egg.

1816
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:37,920
Uh,

1817
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:38,880
it wasn't until,

1818
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:41,010
and I was so grateful
and thankful because,

1819
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:41,191
you know,

1820
00:44:41,191 --> 00:44:45,270
he gave me a gift and I was gonna be
able to eat it and everything else.

1821
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:46,800
And as I'm cooking it,

1822
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:47,550
uh,

1823
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:48,110
and,

1824
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:49,770
and the pygmies are helping me cook it,

1825
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:50,450
uh,

1826
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:51,360
and after I eat it,

1827
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:51,960
um,

1828
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:55,500
they finally tell me around the campfire
after I had pretended to go to sleep

1829
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:58,950
and then got up to come back around the
campfire to talk for hours until we fall

1830
00:44:58,951 --> 00:45:00,030
asleep around the campfire.

1831
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:05,870
They finally told me that the egg
they gave me wasn't the Bantu chiefs.

1832
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,560
It was the pygmy chiefs and the pygmy
chief had saved that to give to me because

1833
00:45:10,561 --> 00:45:11,910
he heard that a visitor was coming.

1834
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,940
And so the Bantu chief like just,

1835
00:45:14,941 --> 00:45:15,300
you know,

1836
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:15,931
took his gift,

1837
00:45:15,931 --> 00:45:16,291
completely,

1838
00:45:16,291 --> 00:45:17,790
stole it and acted like it was his,

1839
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:18,391
uh,

1840
00:45:18,391 --> 00:45:21,810
and really it was the pygmy chief and he
was giving me everything that he had to

1841
00:45:21,811 --> 00:45:24,330
give me because that's food for them,

1842
00:45:24,331 --> 00:45:24,930
like foods,

1843
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:25,201
foods,

1844
00:45:25,201 --> 00:45:26,034
their livelihood.

1845
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:26,790
Um,

1846
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:28,080
and that was a clean source of food.

1847
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:28,531
And,

1848
00:45:28,531 --> 00:45:29,364
uh,

1849
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:29,791
so yeah,

1850
00:45:29,791 --> 00:45:30,241
it's just,

1851
00:45:30,241 --> 00:45:31,980
it's pretty messed up how they treat them.

1852
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:32,820
Wow.

1853
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:33,061
That's,

1854
00:45:33,061 --> 00:45:33,330
so,

1855
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:35,970
that's gotta be so strange for
you to be around both of them,

1856
00:45:35,971 --> 00:45:37,620
to be around the band to people.

1857
00:45:37,621 --> 00:45:38,770
And do you,

1858
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:40,430
do you try to communicate that there's,

1859
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:41,820
there's something wrong with this?

1860
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:42,330
Yeah,

1861
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:43,150
absolutely man.

1862
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:43,983
And uh,

1863
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:45,720
so in six of the places I went to,

1864
00:45:45,721 --> 00:45:46,710
they referred to them as,

1865
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:47,970
these are my slaves,

1866
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:48,990
these are my people.

1867
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:49,890
These are my property,

1868
00:45:49,891 --> 00:45:50,790
kind of of sorts.

1869
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,730
Three of the places I went that
were even deeper in the jungle,

1870
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:54,720
they said,

1871
00:45:54,721 --> 00:45:56,700
what do you want with my animals?

1872
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:00,430
Because they believe them to
be so low class like that.

1873
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:01,530
I see a man,

1874
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:01,821
the,

1875
00:46:01,821 --> 00:46:02,654
the,

1876
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:04,000
the tribes that surround me,

1877
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:04,260
it's,

1878
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:04,520
it,

1879
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:05,670
most of it spanned too.

1880
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:06,631
Sometimes it's rebel.

1881
00:46:06,631 --> 00:46:07,830
Sometimes it's other tribes.

1882
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:08,670
Uh,

1883
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:09,720
but they,

1884
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,600
they treat them worse than
they treat their cattle.

1885
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:13,410
Then they treat their,

1886
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:13,561
well,

1887
00:46:13,561 --> 00:46:14,161
they don't have cattle,

1888
00:46:14,161 --> 00:46:14,851
but they have goats.

1889
00:46:14,851 --> 00:46:17,250
And I don't know if that
falls into cattle category,

1890
00:46:17,251 --> 00:46:17,431
but,

1891
00:46:17,431 --> 00:46:18,000
uh,

1892
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,190
but they treat their goats
better than they treat pygmies.

1893
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:21,391
That's insane.

1894
00:46:21,391 --> 00:46:22,530
And they've always done this.

1895
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:23,700
This is just,

1896
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,370
well the pygmies used to never
have to depend on the band too.

1897
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:27,300
So this is why,

1898
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:29,190
I mean on the Ugi some
people have really been,

1899
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:30,083
uh,

1900
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,850
they're really interested and they'd
been trying to find out what kind of

1901
00:46:32,851 --> 00:46:36,900
slavery there is and the slaves
that we've been able to set free.

1902
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:39,540
They weren't in shackles and
they weren't held at gunpoint.

1903
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:39,781
Like,

1904
00:46:39,781 --> 00:46:41,370
I don't know how to do
that with the rebels yet.

1905
00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:42,660
Maybe in the year I'm there.

1906
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:44,213
Um,

1907
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:45,241
I can befriend them.

1908
00:46:45,241 --> 00:46:48,030
Like I had to befriend the slave masters,

1909
00:46:48,031 --> 00:46:50,550
so they would want to learn and stuff.

1910
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:51,570
Um,

1911
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:53,670
and so with the band to people,

1912
00:46:53,671 --> 00:46:55,200
we just had to sit there and say like,

1913
00:46:55,201 --> 00:46:55,980
Hey,

1914
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:56,131
you know,

1915
00:46:56,131 --> 00:46:57,030
these are people.

1916
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:59,790
Like I'm an educated guy
from the United States.

1917
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,110
I'm not really that educated.

1918
00:47:01,111 --> 00:47:01,944
But uh,

1919
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:03,600
but the Shalom university guys,

1920
00:47:03,601 --> 00:47:07,110
those four guys I'm with to have
masters degrees and to have doctorates.

1921
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:10,320
So they're really educated and they're
the ones leading the university.

1922
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:10,891
So I'm like,

1923
00:47:10,891 --> 00:47:11,620
these guys are,

1924
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:11,960
are,

1925
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,650
are knowledgeable and,

1926
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:14,011
and,

1927
00:47:14,011 --> 00:47:15,380
and I came from us.

1928
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:18,780
These are actually people
like fully human beings.

1929
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:20,760
And the band two eyes
would get big like what?

1930
00:47:20,761 --> 00:47:22,650
And then they'll see us
treating them like humans,

1931
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:25,530
treating them like they have
value treating them like,

1932
00:47:25,531 --> 00:47:25,861
you know,

1933
00:47:25,861 --> 00:47:26,101
they're,

1934
00:47:26,101 --> 00:47:27,130
they're like,

1935
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,370
like they should be treated.

1936
00:47:28,371 --> 00:47:28,790
Right.

1937
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:29,090
Um,

1938
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:29,990
and so it starts to,

1939
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:31,220
to change some of the things in,

1940
00:47:31,221 --> 00:47:34,360
in the pygmies are more slave to
the band through circumstance.

1941
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:35,500
They used to not depend on them.

1942
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,900
They used to be hunters and gatherers
and not have to worry about it.

1943
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:40,690
But whenever I can see the sun at times,

1944
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:45,190
and it sounds like this earth quaking
thunder going on all throughout the day,

1945
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:46,001
thunder going on,

1946
00:47:46,001 --> 00:47:46,840
but I see the sun,

1947
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:47,710
it's not raining on me.

1948
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:48,400
I'm like,

1949
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,450
why is there thunder?

1950
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,780
And then we finally get close enough to
where we see some of the deforestation

1951
00:47:52,781 --> 00:47:53,590
going on.

1952
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:54,400
And these are,

1953
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,130
these are trees that you could
drive to Mack trucks through,

1954
00:47:57,430 --> 00:47:57,791
you know,

1955
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:58,061
and,

1956
00:47:58,061 --> 00:47:58,231
and,

1957
00:47:58,231 --> 00:47:59,620
and they're cutting these trees down.

1958
00:47:59,621 --> 00:48:00,940
And whenever those things fall,

1959
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:01,840
it sounds like thunder.

1960
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:03,970
And so the animals just flee.

1961
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:04,511
I mean,

1962
00:48:04,511 --> 00:48:04,710
and,

1963
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:05,543
and I think,

1964
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:09,640
I think last I heard and I
don't know that it's scientific,

1965
00:48:09,641 --> 00:48:10,540
maybe someone can find it,

1966
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:11,403
but uh,

1967
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,980
but I think they said that the
deforestation in the Congo,

1968
00:48:14,981 --> 00:48:16,750
the second largest rain
forest in the world,

1969
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:17,710
um,

1970
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:21,820
is up to the size of Texas or
over Texas and the last like 15,

1971
00:48:21,821 --> 00:48:24,190
20 years less 1520 years,

1972
00:48:24,191 --> 00:48:24,850
man,

1973
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:25,720
they've divorced,

1974
00:48:25,721 --> 00:48:27,850
did the size of Texas and I've seen it,

1975
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:29,560
I've gone to places where it's just big,

1976
00:48:29,561 --> 00:48:30,394
lush,

1977
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:34,360
awesome forest and then you go to this
place and it's just like wrecked and it

1978
00:48:34,361 --> 00:48:37,570
goes from like looking like
the rain forest and now
it's looking like this might

1979
00:48:37,571 --> 00:48:40,990
turn into like deserty kind of
stuff because like they've just,

1980
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:46,020
it's barren and no one does any or makes
any attempt to replenish the forest.

1981
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:46,511
No,

1982
00:48:46,511 --> 00:48:46,781
not all.

1983
00:48:46,781 --> 00:48:50,260
And see that is why the rain
forest conservationists,

1984
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:54,640
the wildlife preservationist are getting
involved in ways that they're trying to

1985
00:48:54,641 --> 00:48:56,170
buy up that lane and protect it.

1986
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:57,580
And I agree with that.

1987
00:48:57,610 --> 00:48:58,690
That's why I feel like what,

1988
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,930
what Shalom is wanting to do and what
I'm wanting to partner with them.

1989
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:02,711
It's a,

1990
00:49:02,711 --> 00:49:05,920
it's a all encompassing thing where
it's like human slave liberation.

1991
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:09,490
It's a rain forest preservation
and wildlife conservation.

1992
00:49:09,491 --> 00:49:09,651
It's,

1993
00:49:09,651 --> 00:49:09,860
it's,

1994
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:11,950
it's attractive to all those people.

1995
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:15,010
There must be a tremendous amount of
money that they're making from those trees

1996
00:49:15,011 --> 00:49:15,221
though.

1997
00:49:15,221 --> 00:49:15,730
No.

1998
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:16,240
Oh,

1999
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,230
massive amounts.

2000
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:17,591
I mean,

2001
00:49:17,591 --> 00:49:19,300
some of those are very rare woods.

2002
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:19,661
Uh,

2003
00:49:19,661 --> 00:49:21,580
other things that they're using it for is,

2004
00:49:21,581 --> 00:49:21,940
uh,

2005
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:24,100
his charcoal that seeing the Congo,

2006
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,940
since they don't have like electric
electric plants and things like that,

2007
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:30,850
they have to cook for them to cook.

2008
00:49:30,851 --> 00:49:31,900
If they burn up wood,

2009
00:49:31,901 --> 00:49:35,650
it's not as long lasting
or as hot as charcoal.

2010
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,090
So I have a picture of a woman
that was a slave for charcoal and,

2011
00:49:40,091 --> 00:49:40,300
um,

2012
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,133
she had to,

2013
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:45,370
her slave master put this bag
of maybe 120 pounds minimum.

2014
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:46,031
I mean,

2015
00:49:46,031 --> 00:49:48,070
the bag of charcoal was
taller than she was.

2016
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:48,371
I mean,

2017
00:49:48,371 --> 00:49:49,240
a pygmy woman is,

2018
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:50,260
is small.

2019
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,131
Um,

2020
00:49:51,131 --> 00:49:53,020
I don't know if you can pull
up the one chai booze Sicu,

2021
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:54,550
the picture that says [inaudible].

2022
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:55,360
Um,

2023
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:59,140
but I mean these are small people and
they're carrying bags of charcoal where

2024
00:49:59,141 --> 00:50:01,120
two slave masters put it on their back,

2025
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:05,260
tie a rope around their head and this
woman having to walk four or five

2026
00:50:05,261 --> 00:50:10,261
kilometers on these little paths carrying
this charcoal and they'll cut down the

2027
00:50:10,271 --> 00:50:11,380
trees to make charcoal.

2028
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:14,740
They'll cut them down and
they'll start a fire and,

2029
00:50:14,741 --> 00:50:17,980
but they'll put like dirt over
the fire and it smolders and it,

2030
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:21,700
I don't know if it's a week long
process or a few day long process,

2031
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:24,040
but it makes it just a long burning.

2032
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:26,860
And so that's how most people cook in the,

2033
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:32,240
and in Rwanda and in Uganda and in Burundi
and those places we'll get charcoal

2034
00:50:32,241 --> 00:50:34,310
from the Congo jungle
cause there's so much wood,

2035
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:35,390
they don't even think about it.

2036
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:36,410
Wow.

2037
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:37,243
Yeah.

2038
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:38,870
What a fucking trip.

2039
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:40,400
So these,

2040
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:42,390
these poor people that are,

2041
00:50:42,391 --> 00:50:44,990
are just recently slaved.

2042
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:45,950
Hmm.

2043
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:46,311
These,

2044
00:50:46,311 --> 00:50:46,491
uh,

2045
00:50:46,491 --> 00:50:47,301
these poor people,

2046
00:50:47,301 --> 00:50:48,230
these poor pig beans.

2047
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:50,720
Before that they,

2048
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:51,913
they were,

2049
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,110
they were able to hunt and gather the,

2050
00:50:54,111 --> 00:50:56,270
able to do everything where
they treat it as people.

2051
00:50:56,271 --> 00:50:57,104
Then,

2052
00:50:57,530 --> 00:50:58,363
uh,

2053
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,490
I would say there are
treated a lot better,

2054
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,310
but still they've never
been believed to be,

2055
00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:05,630
um,

2056
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:06,410
fully human.

2057
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:08,150
They've always thought
of them as Subhuman,

2058
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:09,110
part monkey,

2059
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:09,640
part,

2060
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:10,160
um,

2061
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:10,701
part man.

2062
00:51:10,701 --> 00:51:11,570
And uh,

2063
00:51:11,571 --> 00:51:14,490
the thing is that with the Bantu,

2064
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:15,170
uh,

2065
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:16,130
the relationship,

2066
00:51:16,131 --> 00:51:19,370
the band too and pygmies used
to have is they would trade,

2067
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,410
the pygmies were master
hunters and they still are a,

2068
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:23,630
if there was more wildlife,

2069
00:51:23,631 --> 00:51:24,500
this was a specialty,

2070
00:51:24,501 --> 00:51:28,800
but they would go hunt bushmeat and
then they would come to the band.

2071
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,670
What's bushmeat emotionally like?

2072
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:31,400
Uh,

2073
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,300
some monkeys,

2074
00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:33,140
um,

2075
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:33,250
uh,

2076
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:34,850
also antelope and uh,

2077
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,310
just anything wild game inside of,

2078
00:51:37,311 --> 00:51:39,290
so that's try CQ that you just put up.

2079
00:51:39,291 --> 00:51:40,520
That's my mom and the tribe.

2080
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:41,631
Oh,

2081
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:42,830
it sounds so grown woman.

2082
00:51:42,831 --> 00:51:42,980
Yeah,

2083
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:43,810
she's in her mid forties.

2084
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:47,360
She's probably as old as my mom is 46.

2085
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:50,840
So that's taboo seeker and she's awesome.

2086
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:52,100
She,

2087
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,750
that was her first
picture ever taken of her.

2088
00:51:53,751 --> 00:51:55,880
So I have some other
ones where she smiling,

2089
00:51:55,881 --> 00:51:56,241
but that,

2090
00:51:56,241 --> 00:51:57,410
that's the one that shows her,

2091
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:58,280
uh,

2092
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,060
her size.

2093
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:01,370
So that's how they got their name p pygmy,

2094
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,510
which is elbow height.

2095
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:05,960
So they really are just like
the bullied people of the world.

2096
00:52:05,961 --> 00:52:06,201
Yeah.

2097
00:52:06,201 --> 00:52:07,500
And he's bullied people the world.

2098
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:11,780
I mean there was times that I've gotten
sick to my stomach hearing the stories

2099
00:52:11,781 --> 00:52:12,620
that have happened to them.

2100
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:14,330
And that's what I was saying,

2101
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:18,440
that they would go hunt and then they
would come to the edge of the forest where

2102
00:52:18,441 --> 00:52:21,020
the band to are and the band to grow corn,

2103
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:21,560
grow,

2104
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,393
grow beans.

2105
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:25,580
And they would basically want some
side dishes to go with their meat.

2106
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,340
And so they would trade
sometimes like the,

2107
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:29,031
the,

2108
00:52:29,031 --> 00:52:32,570
the wild plants that they would
gather and they would come and trade.

2109
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:36,620
They're either bushmeat or they're hunted
animals and they're different kinds of

2110
00:52:36,621 --> 00:52:37,550
like mushrooms and stuff.

2111
00:52:37,551 --> 00:52:42,140
And they'd trade it with
the band to peoples for some
corn or beans or rice or a

2112
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,190
cassava leafs,

2113
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:45,410
which I can make a Ugalde out of.

2114
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:46,310
Um,

2115
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:48,980
it's like kind of paste like thing
that takes on the flavor of the meat.

2116
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,920
And they would do it had
a trading relationship.

2117
00:52:51,921 --> 00:52:56,921
Sometimes band two would go find the
pygmies because they wanted some meat and

2118
00:52:57,621 --> 00:52:59,150
they weren't the best shepherds.

2119
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:00,860
And so they could grow the corn and beans,

2120
00:53:00,861 --> 00:53:01,694
but they wanted to meet.

2121
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:03,860
And so that's how the
relationship started.

2122
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,550
And then they started to get exploited
whenever they could no longer hunt.

2123
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:08,443
Like they,

2124
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:08,910
they,

2125
00:53:08,910 --> 00:53:09,290
they,

2126
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:10,160
they really can.

2127
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:11,060
Um,

2128
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,440
the animals started fleeing,

2129
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:13,050
uh,

2130
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:17,030
in the wildlife conservationist
and rainforest preservationists.

2131
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:19,580
Preservationists are trying
to push them towards the road.

2132
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,380
They made a bunch of promises.

2133
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:21,820
Uh,

2134
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:26,820
I mean a lot of these NGOs that had
their special interest would promise the

2135
00:53:27,421 --> 00:53:27,960
pygmies,

2136
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,000
if you go off the deep forest,

2137
00:53:30,001 --> 00:53:31,740
if you let us have this,

2138
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:32,730
um,

2139
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:35,130
we'll take care of you whenever
you're closer to the road.

2140
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,900
We'll make sure you you're taking care of.

2141
00:53:36,901 --> 00:53:38,060
And then they just never took care of him.

2142
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:38,680
Uh,

2143
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:41,900
and then the band to buy up the land from
underneath them and then in slave and

2144
00:53:41,901 --> 00:53:42,091
say,

2145
00:53:42,091 --> 00:53:42,751
you're on our land,

2146
00:53:42,751 --> 00:53:43,584
you work at.

2147
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:46,080
And so it's just kind of a whole crazy,

2148
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:50,490
how does people feel about you
taking off going to America to,

2149
00:53:50,491 --> 00:53:53,430
to let everybody know about
them and then flying back again?

2150
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:53,861
Mean he's this,

2151
00:53:53,861 --> 00:53:54,180
uh,

2152
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:56,040
this must be so bizarre for them.

2153
00:53:56,430 --> 00:53:56,791
Yeah.

2154
00:53:56,791 --> 00:53:57,624
Well,

2155
00:53:58,230 --> 00:53:59,850
that's what's crazy at first,

2156
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:00,361
every,

2157
00:54:00,361 --> 00:54:01,050
all the night,

2158
00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:01,350
well,

2159
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:02,370
I've been to more than nine,

2160
00:54:02,371 --> 00:54:06,000
but the last time I went I went to
nine different tribes and of pygmies,

2161
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:07,440
a little nine villages,

2162
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:09,211
each one of them.

2163
00:54:09,211 --> 00:54:10,530
I'd never seen a white dude before.

2164
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:11,070
Uh,

2165
00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:12,930
so that scares them.

2166
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:13,231
I mean,

2167
00:54:13,231 --> 00:54:15,240
there'd be times that
it would take an hour,

2168
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:20,220
maybe even sometimes a little over
an hour before someone in that tribe.

2169
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:22,350
Most of the time it was
always women or children,

2170
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:23,040
uh,

2171
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:26,010
that would finally come up to me and touch
me to make sure they don't go through

2172
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:28,530
me like I was a spirit
or a ghost of some sort.

2173
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:29,490
Um,

2174
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:33,270
and then once one person felt me and I'd
play a game with them or something like

2175
00:54:33,271 --> 00:54:33,490
that,

2176
00:54:33,490 --> 00:54:34,323
then more would,

2177
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:37,320
I mean literally come out
from hiding behind trees,

2178
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:38,483
come out from,

2179
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:38,910
uh,

2180
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:39,601
from the forest.

2181
00:54:39,601 --> 00:54:40,201
Whenever I come in,

2182
00:54:40,201 --> 00:54:41,160
sometimes they would flee,

2183
00:54:41,161 --> 00:54:41,581
run,

2184
00:54:41,581 --> 00:54:44,010
cry kids like flailing on the ground,

2185
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,450
like just freaked out by me.

2186
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:46,410
Um,

2187
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:47,790
but whenever I'd make friends with them,

2188
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:48,430
uh,

2189
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:49,950
then they would ask me one thing,

2190
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:52,260
every place that I went
and all nine tribes,

2191
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:55,890
they asked me will I
help them have a voice?

2192
00:54:56,610 --> 00:54:57,150
That was the thing.

2193
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:57,391
They were like,

2194
00:54:57,391 --> 00:54:58,620
we have no voice here.

2195
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:01,230
They're the only tribe not
allowed to have their citizenship,

2196
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:01,950
um,

2197
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:03,880
in Congo and like,

2198
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:05,190
so they have zero voice.

2199
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:06,383
Wow.

2200
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:10,570
What a strange turn your life has taken.

2201
00:55:10,571 --> 00:55:11,410
That this is a,

2202
00:55:11,411 --> 00:55:14,790
you've gone from being on the
house and the ultimate fighter,

2203
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:15,400
you know,

2204
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:20,400
competing in the heavyweight version of
the show to now live in a grass hut in

2205
00:55:20,791 --> 00:55:21,420
the Congo.

2206
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:21,721
What a,

2207
00:55:21,721 --> 00:55:23,160
that's a string or a leaf,

2208
00:55:23,161 --> 00:55:25,800
hod rather strange journey you're on,

2209
00:55:25,801 --> 00:55:26,634
man.

2210
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:27,720
Yeah,

2211
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:28,553
to be honest,

2212
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:30,330
I wouldn't change it.

2213
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:30,900
I mean with,

2214
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:34,320
especially with this video
going viral and with a,

2215
00:55:34,321 --> 00:55:35,154
yesterday,

2216
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:36,533
um,

2217
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:38,840
US talking about a book deal and,

2218
00:55:38,841 --> 00:55:40,440
and today I went out to,

2219
00:55:40,441 --> 00:55:41,060
uh,

2220
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:45,510
to lunch with a publicist that will
really worked on the blind side and the

2221
00:55:45,511 --> 00:55:46,590
movie invincible.

2222
00:55:46,591 --> 00:55:47,360
And,

2223
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:47,970
uh,

2224
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:51,120
I forget some other big time
blockbusters that he worked on.

2225
00:55:51,121 --> 00:55:51,271
But,

2226
00:55:51,271 --> 00:55:51,960
uh,

2227
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:55,440
I mean people are saying that this is a
kind of crazy story and the whole thing

2228
00:55:55,441 --> 00:55:56,880
is the Sandra Bullock movie,

2229
00:55:56,881 --> 00:55:57,390
man.

2230
00:55:57,390 --> 00:55:58,223
There we go.

2231
00:55:58,350 --> 00:55:59,040
I'm going to have her,

2232
00:55:59,040 --> 00:55:59,970
I'm gonna have her play me

2233
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,900
my is Justin a chick?

2234
00:56:03,930 --> 00:56:04,763
Yeah.

2235
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:05,190
Yeah.

2236
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:06,840
Well we pulled it and uh,

2237
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:10,570
he was more likely to believe that
it will more vulnerable situations.

2238
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:12,720
You get this giant MMA
fighter go into the Congo,

2239
00:56:12,721 --> 00:56:14,250
kicking people's asses then ain't right.

2240
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:15,203
Yeah.

2241
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:16,201
Yeah.

2242
00:56:16,201 --> 00:56:16,920
No,

2243
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:17,790
me and I just,

2244
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:18,480
the,

2245
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:19,990
the wild turn is man,

2246
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:20,880
I just feel like it's,

2247
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:23,130
it's something that I can be fully,

2248
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:25,130
wholeheartedly passionate about and I'm,

2249
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:26,710
I'm fulfilled doing it.

2250
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:27,550
And uh,

2251
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,140
and when I say they're my family,

2252
00:56:29,141 --> 00:56:31,450
I mean it seemed very,

2253
00:56:31,451 --> 00:56:32,200
very sincere.

2254
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:32,651
How old are you,

2255
00:56:32,651 --> 00:56:33,070
Justin?

2256
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:33,903
25.

2257
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:35,470
So this is a good time.

2258
00:56:35,471 --> 00:56:36,340
You don't have kids,

2259
00:56:36,341 --> 00:56:37,840
you don't have responsibilities.

2260
00:56:37,841 --> 00:56:38,620
You can,

2261
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:40,730
you can go and just follow your,

2262
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:42,490
your desire and your passion and your,

2263
00:56:42,491 --> 00:56:42,731
your,

2264
00:56:42,731 --> 00:56:46,060
your interest here as the
only thing that really,

2265
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:46,571
I mean,

2266
00:56:46,571 --> 00:56:48,010
I have a future wife and uh,

2267
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:49,023
got to find her.

2268
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:49,630
What's that?

2269
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:50,710
You got to find her.

2270
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:52,450
I have her in Dallas Fort Worth,

2271
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:52,731
right.

2272
00:56:52,731 --> 00:56:55,540
She's in Dallas and you're going
to the fucking Congo for a year.

2273
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:58,270
So how does she think about that at first?

2274
00:56:58,480 --> 00:56:58,751
Well,

2275
00:56:58,751 --> 00:56:59,710
at first she was pumped.

2276
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:00,910
Then,

2277
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:01,570
uh,

2278
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:01,871
she,

2279
00:57:01,871 --> 00:57:05,170
she's done like some different trips
around the world and has gone and helped a

2280
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:09,880
orphanages and Mexico and she kind of
has a heart to maybe one day started an

2281
00:57:09,881 --> 00:57:10,714
orphanage.

2282
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:11,210
Um,

2283
00:57:11,210 --> 00:57:12,730
and so she's got a great heart man.

2284
00:57:12,731 --> 00:57:13,271
She's awesome.

2285
00:57:13,271 --> 00:57:14,010
She's gorgeous.

2286
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:14,350
Um,

2287
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:15,183
but,

2288
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:15,430
uh,

2289
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:18,040
the s the first time I went,

2290
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:18,820
um,

2291
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:22,870
I went one time before we started
dating and then the second time I went,

2292
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:23,780
uh,

2293
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:24,050
it was,

2294
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:24,640
it was hard.

2295
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,630
It was hard for her because she
started doing some research,

2296
00:57:26,690 --> 00:57:27,820
started finding out that,

2297
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:28,810
uh,

2298
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:29,830
the Congo leaves,

2299
00:57:29,831 --> 00:57:32,050
people call it the African Holocaust,

2300
00:57:32,051 --> 00:57:33,310
that's what they call it.

2301
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:34,030
Um,

2302
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:36,010
because depending on
what stats you look at,

2303
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:37,570
they say it surpasses,

2304
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:38,441
uh,

2305
00:57:38,441 --> 00:57:41,830
the death of death toll of
the Jews and the Holocaust,

2306
00:57:41,831 --> 00:57:42,790
which is pretty crazy.

2307
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:46,660
But some stats say 6.8 million
Congolese and the last 10 years,

2308
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:48,460
some say over 5 million,

2309
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:49,840
but it's between 5 million.

2310
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:50,830
And 7 million men.

2311
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:51,880
Um,

2312
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:52,411
and so it,

2313
00:57:52,411 --> 00:57:53,710
it really is like one of the,

2314
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:54,370
if not the,

2315
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:58,450
it is the worst conflict zone last year
in 2012 because then she was saying,

2316
00:57:58,451 --> 00:57:59,380
maybe I'll go with you.

2317
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:00,491
And I was like,

2318
00:58:00,491 --> 00:58:00,881
yeah,

2319
00:58:00,881 --> 00:58:01,500
and then,

2320
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:01,720
uh,

2321
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:02,440
maybe,

2322
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:02,711
uh,

2323
00:58:02,711 --> 00:58:03,190
we'll,

2324
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:04,023
we'll,

2325
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:04,720
uh,

2326
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:05,980
we'll talk about that.

2327
00:58:05,981 --> 00:58:06,730
And uh,

2328
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:11,730
but the staff for 2012 was that over
400,000 women were raped in the Congo.

2329
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:14,500
It's 58 women every 60 minutes.

2330
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:15,690
So,

2331
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:16,160
uh,

2332
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,870
you can't bring your woman to the Connoco,

2333
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:20,200
especially not kind of,

2334
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:22,660
it was the most dangerous
Walmart parking lot in the world.

2335
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:24,010
Uh,

2336
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:25,000
and so it's,

2337
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:25,540
uh,

2338
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:25,841
it's,

2339
00:58:25,841 --> 00:58:26,950
it's been a crazy journey.

2340
00:58:26,951 --> 00:58:29,050
It's made us both grow a
lot in a relationship to,

2341
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:30,393
um,

2342
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:32,800
me being gone for that
month there and her,

2343
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:33,400
you know,

2344
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:35,230
sitting there and thinking about,

2345
00:58:35,830 --> 00:58:36,401
am I okay?

2346
00:58:36,401 --> 00:58:37,420
Cause I know contact.

2347
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:38,230
Um,

2348
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:39,370
so all this different stuff.

2349
00:58:39,371 --> 00:58:39,760
We,

2350
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:42,670
we've really been on a journey and we
were talking about even getting married

2351
00:58:42,671 --> 00:58:43,300
before I went,

2352
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:43,990
and then now we're,

2353
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:46,840
we're talking about waiting
until I get back from the year.

2354
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:48,250
But it's just something
I know I got to do.

2355
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,370
Are you going to come back
at all during that year?

2356
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:52,421
So far,

2357
00:58:52,421 --> 00:58:53,254
no.

2358
00:58:53,350 --> 00:58:54,630
I mean like spring.

2359
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:55,740
Greg stirred,

2360
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:58,020
actually my girlfriend's
sister's getting married and a,

2361
00:58:58,021 --> 00:58:59,410
I might want to come back for that.

2362
00:58:59,411 --> 00:59:00,244
But uh,

2363
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,001
but so far,

2364
00:59:01,001 --> 00:59:01,271
no.

2365
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:02,560
And it depends on my visa.

2366
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:06,310
Luckily with Shalom university I might
be able to get like a student visa.

2367
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:07,151
Uh,

2368
00:59:07,151 --> 00:59:11,170
I might be able to do something with
a school to get a year long visa,

2369
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:12,900
but if I can't get to
your long be something,

2370
00:59:12,901 --> 00:59:13,660
I'd have to come back.

2371
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:16,090
And you have no income
while you're doing all that?

2372
00:59:16,290 --> 00:59:16,540
No,

2373
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:16,840
man,

2374
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,790
I have the last year and a half,

2375
00:59:18,791 --> 00:59:18,941
man.

2376
00:59:18,941 --> 00:59:20,530
I've honestly felt like I was just a nut.

2377
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:20,900
Like,

2378
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:21,940
well not enough.

2379
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:22,843
I knew it was right,

2380
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:24,210
but I felt like a lone nut.

2381
00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:25,160
Like everybody,

2382
00:59:25,370 --> 00:59:25,731
people be like,

2383
00:59:25,731 --> 00:59:25,851
oh,

2384
00:59:25,851 --> 00:59:26,481
that's really good,

2385
00:59:26,481 --> 00:59:27,590
but why don't you go back to fighting?

2386
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:27,911
Uh,

2387
00:59:27,911 --> 00:59:28,221
I mean,

2388
00:59:28,221 --> 00:59:32,150
I've worn my last three fights and then
I took some time off to go see the world

2389
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:34,310
and see what people I could fight for.

2390
00:59:34,430 --> 00:59:36,200
And I couldn't find anyone
better to fight for them,

2391
00:59:36,201 --> 00:59:38,510
the pygmies because they're the
worst off people group on the planet.

2392
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:38,811
And,

2393
00:59:38,811 --> 00:59:39,644
uh,

2394
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:40,221
but yeah,

2395
00:59:40,221 --> 00:59:40,431
man,

2396
00:59:40,431 --> 00:59:40,601
it's,

2397
00:59:40,601 --> 00:59:41,750
it's been a crazy journey,

2398
00:59:41,751 --> 00:59:41,991
you know,

2399
00:59:41,991 --> 00:59:42,801
from people,

2400
00:59:42,801 --> 00:59:43,401
a family,

2401
00:59:43,401 --> 00:59:45,330
from close friends all see.

2402
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:48,770
And I'm an idiot for given up fighting
and I could actually do it well and,

2403
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:49,460
um,

2404
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:50,600
at grudge training center,

2405
00:59:50,601 --> 00:59:51,434
going from,

2406
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:53,250
from being invited thereafter,

2407
00:59:53,270 --> 00:59:57,710
the ultimate fighter to then being kicked
off of it when I was a drug addict to

2408
00:59:57,711 --> 00:59:59,360
then being invited back onto it.

2409
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:00,350
Uh,

2410
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:01,010
and then,

2411
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:01,520
um,

2412
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,360
me saying,

2413
01:00:02,361 --> 01:00:02,691
you know,

2414
01:00:02,691 --> 01:00:03,201
I'm going to,

2415
01:00:03,201 --> 01:00:04,280
I'm going to leave and go,

2416
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:05,000
go here.

2417
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:05,811
And then they'll be like,

2418
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:06,650
what are you doing?

2419
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:07,101
You know,

2420
01:00:07,101 --> 01:00:07,220
uh,

2421
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:08,210
my coach Trevor Whitman,

2422
01:00:08,211 --> 01:00:08,841
he's awesome.

2423
01:00:08,841 --> 01:00:09,674
I love that dude,

2424
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:11,571
Bro.

2425
01:00:11,571 --> 01:00:13,700
He's one of the best guys
I know as a person too.

2426
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:14,601
He's just incredible.

2427
01:00:14,601 --> 01:00:15,141
Him and his wife,

2428
01:00:15,141 --> 01:00:16,070
a big giving hearts.

2429
01:00:16,071 --> 01:00:16,881
And we,

2430
01:00:16,881 --> 01:00:17,001
uh,

2431
01:00:17,001 --> 01:00:18,940
we set up three different
hospital visits for the,

2432
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,180
for grudge fight team.

2433
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:20,590
I was,

2434
01:00:20,590 --> 01:00:20,970
uh,

2435
01:00:20,970 --> 01:00:24,290
official volunteer at the
Denver Children's hospital.

2436
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:26,720
So we went there three
different times as official,

2437
01:00:26,721 --> 01:00:27,590
like whole team.

2438
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:28,550
Um,

2439
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:29,361
and so that was great.

2440
01:00:29,361 --> 01:00:30,590
That was how I started showing them,

2441
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:30,861
Hey,

2442
01:00:30,861 --> 01:00:32,390
I've really made a life change here.

2443
01:00:32,391 --> 01:00:34,760
I'm no longer the drug addict
that was coming in here.

2444
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:35,331
And,

2445
01:00:35,331 --> 01:00:35,760
uh,

2446
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,820
and I mean we're actually a
depressed drunk drug addict.

2447
01:00:37,821 --> 01:00:38,930
Tried to take my own life,

2448
01:00:38,931 --> 01:00:39,741
all this different stuff.

2449
01:00:39,741 --> 01:00:40,640
And what were you,

2450
01:00:40,641 --> 01:00:41,600
what were you addicted to?

2451
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,000
Was addicted to a bunch of pills,

2452
01:00:44,070 --> 01:00:44,811
a bunch of pain pills.

2453
01:00:44,811 --> 01:00:46,130
I had three different doctors that would,

2454
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:47,360
that would give me scripts.

2455
01:00:47,361 --> 01:00:47,541
And,

2456
01:00:47,541 --> 01:00:47,900
uh,

2457
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:51,020
I had one doctor that would give me a
hundred at a time and I could go to all

2458
01:00:51,021 --> 01:00:52,610
three of a hundred at a time.

2459
01:00:52,611 --> 01:00:53,110
No joke.

2460
01:00:53,110 --> 01:00:53,943
Which pills?

2461
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:54,390
Uh,

2462
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:54,620
well,

2463
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:55,520
hydrocodone a lot.

2464
01:00:55,521 --> 01:00:56,331
But then also,

2465
01:00:56,331 --> 01:00:56,630
um,

2466
01:00:56,630 --> 01:00:59,020
I even gotten into like
harder stuff like on,

2467
01:00:59,021 --> 01:00:59,840
is that Vikatin?

2468
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:00,171
Yeah.

2469
01:01:00,171 --> 01:01:00,441
And then,

2470
01:01:00,441 --> 01:01:00,711
and then,

2471
01:01:00,711 --> 01:01:00,921
uh,

2472
01:01:00,921 --> 01:01:03,590
and then oxy and oxy is the hardest,

2473
01:01:03,591 --> 01:01:03,820
right?

2474
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:04,250
Yeah,

2475
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:04,551
Bro.

2476
01:01:04,551 --> 01:01:05,240
I don't,

2477
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:09,050
I don't remember two to two
and a half months of my life.

2478
01:01:09,051 --> 01:01:09,884
Like just,

2479
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:14,030
there's no memories except for there's
one hazy memory and was from my best

2480
01:01:14,031 --> 01:01:15,650
friend at the time and we're,

2481
01:01:15,651 --> 01:01:17,150
we're building that relationship back.

2482
01:01:17,151 --> 01:01:17,331
But,

2483
01:01:17,331 --> 01:01:18,164
uh,

2484
01:01:18,190 --> 01:01:18,380
uh,

2485
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:19,101
my best friend at the time,

2486
01:01:19,101 --> 01:01:22,190
the guy that got me into fighting and
then my first fight was because he was in

2487
01:01:22,191 --> 01:01:23,090
the hospital and,

2488
01:01:23,091 --> 01:01:23,924
uh,

2489
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:24,980
and he couldn't make it to the fight.

2490
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:27,020
He had a staph infection where they
almost thought he was going to lose his,

2491
01:01:27,021 --> 01:01:27,681
that his leg.

2492
01:01:27,681 --> 01:01:29,570
It was that bad in a lot of guys get that.

2493
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:30,261
Oh Man.

2494
01:01:30,261 --> 01:01:30,471
Yeah.

2495
01:01:30,471 --> 01:01:30,950
And he got,

2496
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:31,580
he got,

2497
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:32,361
he got put to the side,

2498
01:01:32,361 --> 01:01:34,340
like they literally thought
we might have to take his leg.

2499
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:36,110
It was deep and do as like,

2500
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:36,290
oh,

2501
01:01:36,290 --> 01:01:37,970
they thought it might've
been in his femur bone.

2502
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:40,580
So he's laid up man.

2503
01:01:40,581 --> 01:01:41,414
And uh,

2504
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:42,500
and then I went to the,

2505
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:43,671
to the promoter,

2506
01:01:43,671 --> 01:01:44,480
told him he's out.

2507
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:45,830
Then the guy started talking trash.

2508
01:01:45,831 --> 01:01:50,000
He just ended up in the hospital one day
early and the promoter had watched me

2509
01:01:50,001 --> 01:01:50,420
wrestle.

2510
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:51,260
It was an Oklahoma.

2511
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:54,710
And so he knew my high school wrestling
coaches who are both two Olympic gold

2512
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:55,544
medalist,

2513
01:01:55,790 --> 01:01:58,130
both wrestled Oklahoma state
were national champions there.

2514
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:00,950
Kenny Monday and Kendall Cross and uh,

2515
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:02,420
Kenny money fund MMA for a while.

2516
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:02,690
Yeah.

2517
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:02,960
Yeah.

2518
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:05,840
He was one of my training partners to
whenever I was in coaches whenever I was

2519
01:02:05,841 --> 01:02:06,620
fighting.

2520
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:07,220
Um,

2521
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:09,650
he's been a coach of mine
since I was 15 years old.

2522
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:10,610
Uh,

2523
01:02:10,610 --> 01:02:11,443
and then,

2524
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:12,080
yeah.

2525
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:12,561
Anyways,

2526
01:02:12,561 --> 01:02:13,250
the guy,

2527
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:13,760
uh,

2528
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:14,840
his name's Justin McCorkle,

2529
01:02:14,841 --> 01:02:16,550
I think he's like a foreign one,

2530
01:02:16,850 --> 01:02:18,110
pro MMA heavyweight.

2531
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:19,410
And um,

2532
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:20,011
yeah,

2533
01:02:20,011 --> 01:02:20,791
I missed his wedding,

2534
01:02:20,791 --> 01:02:21,481
not just being there,

2535
01:02:21,481 --> 01:02:22,740
but being the best man.

2536
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:25,830
And I remember I had an eight minute
voicemail and meet at like 10 seconds

2537
01:02:25,831 --> 01:02:27,810
through because it said something like,

2538
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:29,040
you missed my wedding.

2539
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:30,180
And then I'm like,

2540
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:30,810
oh,

2541
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:31,261
freak,

2542
01:02:31,261 --> 01:02:31,561
you know,

2543
01:02:31,561 --> 01:02:33,720
and then it paused and he goes,

2544
01:02:33,721 --> 01:02:35,520
you miss being my best man.

2545
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:36,600
Uh,

2546
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:38,100
and then I just remember
hanging up because,

2547
01:02:38,101 --> 01:02:39,570
and going straight back to the drugs.

2548
01:02:39,571 --> 01:02:41,730
And so I'm a medical marijuana
license for three years,

2549
01:02:41,731 --> 01:02:43,080
which I'm cool with people having that.

2550
01:02:43,081 --> 01:02:44,760
But I went with,

2551
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:47,100
I would always piggyback everything.

2552
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:48,023
Like I would,

2553
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:53,160
the reason grudge voted me off the team
was I started waking up and fixing my

2554
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:54,330
steel cut oats,

2555
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:55,530
fixing my egg whites,

2556
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:56,341
getting my berries,

2557
01:02:56,341 --> 01:02:57,570
putting in the steel cut oats,

2558
01:02:58,020 --> 01:02:58,800
um,

2559
01:02:58,800 --> 01:02:59,640
fixing all that.

2560
01:02:59,670 --> 01:03:00,270
But then,

2561
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:00,870
uh,

2562
01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:03,930
starting on my vaporizer before
practice and then hitting a,

2563
01:03:04,090 --> 01:03:07,920
the pain pills and then starting with
a washing it down with hard liquor man.

2564
01:03:08,310 --> 01:03:10,380
And so then I go train and they knew it.

2565
01:03:10,410 --> 01:03:13,950
They knew I sweated out love out
of my poor was coming liquor.

2566
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:14,740
Um,

2567
01:03:14,740 --> 01:03:15,381
they knew that.

2568
01:03:15,381 --> 01:03:16,214
I mean,

2569
01:03:16,370 --> 01:03:18,120
how would you bro,

2570
01:03:18,121 --> 01:03:18,650
I don't know.

2571
01:03:18,650 --> 01:03:20,550
I mean I was going through a literal,

2572
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:21,540
when I say depression,

2573
01:03:21,541 --> 01:03:22,590
I mean like the darkest,

2574
01:03:22,591 --> 01:03:23,270
deepest,

2575
01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:24,103
um,

2576
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:26,820
most desperate time of my life.

2577
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:28,590
And what was that being caused by?

2578
01:03:29,550 --> 01:03:30,383
Um,

2579
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:31,680
selfishness.

2580
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:32,071
I don't know,

2581
01:03:32,071 --> 01:03:32,430
man.

2582
01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:34,230
A lot of different things that,

2583
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:34,921
that didn't,

2584
01:03:34,921 --> 01:03:35,754
uh,

2585
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:37,710
it didn't make sense to me.

2586
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:39,270
I grew up at 13 years old.

2587
01:03:39,271 --> 01:03:39,660
I was,

2588
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:40,770
I was heavily bullied.

2589
01:03:40,771 --> 01:03:41,880
That's when I found the UFC.

2590
01:03:42,450 --> 01:03:42,930
Uh,

2591
01:03:42,930 --> 01:03:43,670
13,

2592
01:03:43,670 --> 01:03:45,840
I sat at the lunch table by myself,

2593
01:03:45,841 --> 01:03:47,280
had people throw stuff at me.

2594
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,233
I,

2595
01:03:48,510 --> 01:03:49,140
uh,

2596
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:53,580
I was invited to my middle school
crushes like a birthday party and,

2597
01:03:53,581 --> 01:03:53,970
uh,

2598
01:03:53,970 --> 01:03:55,080
and it was a costume party.

2599
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:56,010
I got the invitation.

2600
01:03:56,010 --> 01:03:56,191
I'm like,

2601
01:03:56,191 --> 01:03:58,080
no ways costume party wins a prize.

2602
01:03:58,081 --> 01:04:01,110
And I remember her dad
worked for Dr Pepper and,

2603
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:01,620
um,

2604
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:03,350
she loved transformer.

2605
01:04:03,351 --> 01:04:05,820
So I came to the party as
a Dr Pepper transformer,

2606
01:04:06,060 --> 01:04:10,980
like with the Dr Pepper Cardboard and
made out of a made out of duct tape and Dr

2607
01:04:10,981 --> 01:04:12,000
Pepper boxes.

2608
01:04:12,001 --> 01:04:12,630
And,

2609
01:04:12,630 --> 01:04:12,961
uh,

2610
01:04:12,961 --> 01:04:14,670
I got there and I was 30 minutes late.

2611
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:15,780
Everyone's pointing,

2612
01:04:15,781 --> 01:04:16,321
laughing,

2613
01:04:16,321 --> 01:04:17,101
calling me an idiot.

2614
01:04:17,101 --> 01:04:18,540
And that was whenever I was probably,

2615
01:04:18,541 --> 01:04:21,450
I guess maybe in the
first fight of my life,

2616
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:22,290
uh,

2617
01:04:22,290 --> 01:04:24,230
was suicidal thoughts
cause they were like,

2618
01:04:24,231 --> 01:04:24,841
you're so worthless.

2619
01:04:24,841 --> 01:04:25,980
You should just kill yourself.

2620
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:26,900
Um,

2621
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:27,520
13 old.

2622
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:28,830
Oh yeah.

2623
01:04:28,831 --> 01:04:29,980
I mean I left there.

2624
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:30,800
Oh,

2625
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,160
I there no cell phones.

2626
01:04:32,161 --> 01:04:33,990
So I walked and I got to dairy queen.

2627
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:35,041
I lived in the country,

2628
01:04:35,041 --> 01:04:36,020
so we like that.

2629
01:04:36,090 --> 01:04:37,530
They call that the Texas stop sign,

2630
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:38,453
dairy queen.

2631
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:38,821
And,

2632
01:04:38,821 --> 01:04:39,654
uh,

2633
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:40,531
and so,

2634
01:04:40,531 --> 01:04:40,920
uh,

2635
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,180
I went to dairy queen and,

2636
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:42,540
uh,

2637
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:42,720
I,

2638
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:43,920
I think I remember one of the,

2639
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:44,250
uh,

2640
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:45,083
employees,

2641
01:04:45,610 --> 01:04:48,870
I'm coming out to throw away trash and
I'm like sitting there behind the dairy

2642
01:04:48,871 --> 01:04:50,790
queen right in between
kind of the dumpster.

2643
01:04:51,150 --> 01:04:51,541
And then they're like,

2644
01:04:51,541 --> 01:04:52,141
what's going on?

2645
01:04:52,141 --> 01:04:53,040
And I was just sobbing.

2646
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:54,720
And then I went inside and called my mom.

2647
01:04:54,721 --> 01:04:56,370
She wasn't there for a little
bit and had to sit in there.

2648
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:57,960
They asked what was going on anyways,

2649
01:04:57,961 --> 01:04:59,610
so that was this big left turn.

2650
01:04:59,611 --> 01:05:01,410
But that's when I found the UFC.

2651
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:04,560
And I thought maybe a
few weeks after that,

2652
01:05:04,561 --> 01:05:04,951
and I thought,

2653
01:05:04,951 --> 01:05:06,060
these guys don't get bullied.

2654
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:06,660
Uh,

2655
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:08,520
these guys are like modern day gladiators.

2656
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:09,200
Um,

2657
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:09,350
I,

2658
01:05:09,350 --> 01:05:09,680
I,

2659
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:10,740
and I was,

2660
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:11,491
I mean,

2661
01:05:11,491 --> 01:05:15,300
I was mesmerized by the sport of it
because I loved sports and I always played

2662
01:05:15,301 --> 01:05:16,134
sports growing up.

2663
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:16,740
Um,

2664
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:18,700
but this was multiple sports putting one.

2665
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:19,091
And I'm like,

2666
01:05:19,091 --> 01:05:19,301
man,

2667
01:05:19,301 --> 01:05:20,740
if I could just become one of those guys,

2668
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:23,350
I'll have all the passion,

2669
01:05:23,351 --> 01:05:23,891
the purpose,

2670
01:05:23,891 --> 01:05:25,090
the significance,

2671
01:05:25,091 --> 01:05:25,924
the,

2672
01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:28,120
I'll never be this dude
that I am right now.

2673
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:29,201
And,

2674
01:05:29,201 --> 01:05:29,470
uh,

2675
01:05:29,470 --> 01:05:29,770
I'll,

2676
01:05:29,770 --> 01:05:31,450
I'll be the exact opposite.

2677
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:34,000
And so I set out for
that and started at 15.

2678
01:05:34,001 --> 01:05:35,620
So wrestling under two
Olympic gold medalist,

2679
01:05:35,621 --> 01:05:37,480
17 won my first national championship.

2680
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:40,480
18 was living back and forth
with the Olympic training center.

2681
01:05:40,481 --> 01:05:42,310
19 started fighting professionally.

2682
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:45,280
21 I was on the ultimate fighter 22,

2683
01:05:45,470 --> 01:05:46,303
um,

2684
01:05:46,650 --> 01:05:47,471
fight in 23.

2685
01:05:47,471 --> 01:05:50,080
It was main event at the hard
rock and another promotion.

2686
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:54,700
And I think every time I got my hand
raised and it got worse as this drug

2687
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:55,421
problem got on.

2688
01:05:55,421 --> 01:05:55,631
But,

2689
01:05:55,631 --> 01:05:56,370
uh,

2690
01:05:56,370 --> 01:05:57,020
uh,

2691
01:05:57,020 --> 01:06:00,250
I stopped looking forward to even the
victories of fighting and start looking

2692
01:06:00,251 --> 01:06:01,690
forward to the parties after the fight.

2693
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:03,430
And then I started thinking like,

2694
01:06:03,431 --> 01:06:04,264
uh,

2695
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:04,721
I don't know,

2696
01:06:04,721 --> 01:06:05,890
every time I get my hand raised,

2697
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:06,340
uh,

2698
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:09,580
if you can find a picture of me or
a video of me smiling after a fight,

2699
01:06:09,581 --> 01:06:12,940
that would be the first for me because I
don't think I smiled after any of them.

2700
01:06:13,230 --> 01:06:13,690
Wow.

2701
01:06:13,690 --> 01:06:15,610
I was always looking towards the next one.

2702
01:06:15,730 --> 01:06:15,911
You know,

2703
01:06:15,911 --> 01:06:16,870
most guys jumping up,

2704
01:06:16,871 --> 01:06:17,890
smile and screaming.

2705
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,310
When was your issue with,

2706
01:06:19,570 --> 01:06:20,111
with drugs?

2707
01:06:20,111 --> 01:06:21,440
Was it after the ultimate fighter?

2708
01:06:21,441 --> 01:06:22,151
But it was,

2709
01:06:22,151 --> 01:06:23,500
it was before and after.

2710
01:06:23,501 --> 01:06:27,700
It got really bad after and
I mean it got brutal after I,

2711
01:06:27,701 --> 01:06:28,534
uh,

2712
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:30,220
actually the,

2713
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:30,820
the week of my job,

2714
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:31,780
I don't know if I've ever,

2715
01:06:31,870 --> 01:06:33,220
I told Loretta hunting this,

2716
01:06:33,221 --> 01:06:34,120
I'm a couple of days,

2717
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:36,640
I did an interview for
sports illustrated and uh,

2718
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:38,583
um,

2719
01:06:38,890 --> 01:06:43,890
the week of my John Madsen fight I was
taking handfuls of pills and I was uh,

2720
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:44,360
in,

2721
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:44,561
in,

2722
01:06:44,561 --> 01:06:45,910
in some guys can function,

2723
01:06:46,060 --> 01:06:46,470
um,

2724
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:46,660
and,

2725
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:47,860
and fight and everything.

2726
01:06:47,861 --> 01:06:48,694
Me Though,

2727
01:06:48,730 --> 01:06:51,040
I would piggy back everything if I got,

2728
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:51,971
if I got high,

2729
01:06:51,971 --> 01:06:52,660
I needed,

2730
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:54,580
I needed the pills or I needed a drinker.

2731
01:06:54,790 --> 01:06:57,280
I never did one thing that was my,

2732
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:59,500
that was a huge problem of mine.

2733
01:06:59,530 --> 01:07:04,530
I always piggyback that I had to have
something else and so I was doing that the

2734
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,040
week of my John Madsen
fight for the finale.

2735
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:06,850
And while you were there,

2736
01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:11,850
how was high that week and the pain pills
like lots of pain pills like the day

2737
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:12,881
before?

2738
01:07:12,881 --> 01:07:13,714
I didn't the night,

2739
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:16,150
the day of how did you not test positive?

2740
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:16,630
They didn't,

2741
01:07:16,630 --> 01:07:17,710
they didn't test me on that one.

2742
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:19,330
They tested me when I
fought at the hard rock.

2743
01:07:19,331 --> 01:07:20,680
But at that one they didn't task,

2744
01:07:20,681 --> 01:07:22,420
they only tested the main events.

2745
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:25,920
I think that was the time
that there was a commission.

2746
01:07:25,950 --> 01:07:26,410
Yeah.

2747
01:07:26,410 --> 01:07:27,490
Or even the,

2748
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:30,490
I think the commission hit a time where
they didn't test everybody on the card.

2749
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:33,460
They were only gonna do like the main
event fights or something like that.

2750
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:34,690
And then I was kind of in that window.

2751
01:07:35,110 --> 01:07:35,740
Wow.

2752
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:36,573
Yeah.

2753
01:07:36,610 --> 01:07:37,421
That's crazy,

2754
01:07:37,421 --> 01:07:37,751
man.

2755
01:07:37,751 --> 01:07:37,961
What,

2756
01:07:37,961 --> 01:07:39,610
what would happen if they did test you?

2757
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:40,031
Oh,

2758
01:07:40,031 --> 01:07:41,050
I would've failed big time,

2759
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:42,580
which is like a lot of the other guys do.

2760
01:07:42,581 --> 01:07:43,181
But I mean,

2761
01:07:43,181 --> 01:07:43,970
not a lot of the biggest,

2762
01:07:43,970 --> 01:07:45,410
so you knew you weren't
going to be tested.

2763
01:07:45,411 --> 01:07:46,930
Is that why you were
kept taking the pills?

2764
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:49,190
I honestly,

2765
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:49,930
yeah,

2766
01:07:49,930 --> 01:07:50,830
I would have taken him anyway.

2767
01:07:50,831 --> 01:07:51,340
I didn't care.

2768
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:52,990
I never did any sort of steroids.

2769
01:07:53,050 --> 01:07:53,600
Never.

2770
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:54,610
I already,

2771
01:07:55,510 --> 01:07:56,740
I already felt empty enough,

2772
01:07:56,741 --> 01:07:58,390
I guess with some of the victories.

2773
01:07:58,420 --> 01:08:02,320
And I think whenever we got real bad
was after that Roy Nelson fight on the

2774
01:08:02,321 --> 01:08:06,970
ultimate fighter and Dana and rampage
and Rashad and coach t and basically

2775
01:08:06,971 --> 01:08:08,170
everybody except Roy.

2776
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:08,890
Um,

2777
01:08:08,890 --> 01:08:10,270
was telling me that it should have,

2778
01:08:10,330 --> 01:08:14,290
well that I won or that it should have
gone to a third round at least because I

2779
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:16,010
think one judge thought
want to thought he won.

2780
01:08:16,011 --> 01:08:18,200
It was a split and we
only went two rounds.

2781
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:20,450
And for me this was my dream.

2782
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:21,410
And uh,

2783
01:08:21,410 --> 01:08:24,560
and so whenever that was taken from me
and I felt like it was taken in a wrong

2784
01:08:24,561 --> 01:08:25,220
way,

2785
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:27,650
then what really got bad
was after the Mattson fight,

2786
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:28,070
um,

2787
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:29,450
I lost a split decision again.

2788
01:08:29,451 --> 01:08:30,590
So two back to back.

2789
01:08:31,430 --> 01:08:31,890
I just,

2790
01:08:31,890 --> 01:08:33,380
I lost it and I went straight.

2791
01:08:33,450 --> 01:08:33,890
I mean,

2792
01:08:33,890 --> 01:08:36,380
I don't even remember that we can Vegas.

2793
01:08:36,650 --> 01:08:38,930
What started you off on
pills in the first place?

2794
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:39,591
Well,

2795
01:08:39,591 --> 01:08:41,420
it was it an injury this right here.

2796
01:08:42,050 --> 01:08:42,381
Um,

2797
01:08:42,381 --> 01:08:45,890
so do you know how many times I've
heard that man will guy gets injured?

2798
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:47,510
Is doctor puts them on pills?

2799
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:49,370
Carl [inaudible] same story.

2800
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:50,593
Went off the deep end.

2801
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:55,550
How goddamn addicted or the addictive or
these pills and it just got handed them

2802
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:56,050
out to,

2803
01:08:56,050 --> 01:08:56,900
I remember,

2804
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:58,100
uh,

2805
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:00,230
a bit about my mom would confirm it,

2806
01:09:00,231 --> 01:09:00,441
but,

2807
01:09:00,441 --> 01:09:00,590
uh,

2808
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:01,700
whenever this happened,

2809
01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:06,380
I was 18 and I was living at the
Olympic training center and I wrestled a

2810
01:09:06,381 --> 01:09:07,490
against the world champion.

2811
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:09,320
I didn't give up a point.

2812
01:09:09,321 --> 01:09:11,120
It was kind of like I could
have given up a point,

2813
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:12,313
it would have been similar to,

2814
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:14,210
could have tapped or let it snap,

2815
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:16,520
but I just didn't want to give up a point.

2816
01:09:16,521 --> 01:09:18,740
So I let him and snap and uh,

2817
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:19,790
anyways,

2818
01:09:19,790 --> 01:09:24,790
I probably took at least a month worth
of the oxycodone and a week after that I

2819
01:09:25,071 --> 01:09:25,904
went back.

2820
01:09:26,190 --> 01:09:27,500
Probably took three weeks worth.

2821
01:09:27,501 --> 01:09:28,490
What happened next with arm?

2822
01:09:28,491 --> 01:09:29,620
What position was it in?

2823
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:30,950
It was just wrestling,

2824
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:32,360
Greco Roman wrestling.

2825
01:09:32,361 --> 01:09:33,100
So,

2826
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:33,380
uh,

2827
01:09:33,380 --> 01:09:36,320
have you ever seen a gut wrench like
short Recko how they go to turn somebody?

2828
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:36,831
Um,

2829
01:09:36,831 --> 01:09:37,664
so I was fighting it,

2830
01:09:37,670 --> 01:09:39,370
the post explaining to people
who don't know anything.

2831
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:40,820
I was,

2832
01:09:40,820 --> 01:09:42,200
I was a on my belly.

2833
01:09:42,230 --> 01:09:44,650
A guy who maybe took me down and,

2834
01:09:44,690 --> 01:09:45,800
and once he's on your back,

2835
01:09:45,801 --> 01:09:47,610
he goes to do a gut wrench.

2836
01:09:47,611 --> 01:09:50,840
She wraps around your ribs and he starts
to crank down with his shoulder on the

2837
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:51,880
back of your shoulder blades.

2838
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:55,490
You're trying to fight it so
your back doesn't break 90,

2839
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:58,850
it breaks 90 degrees and in your
back angles towards the Mat,

2840
01:09:59,410 --> 01:10:02,150
the guy gets two points or
maybe you one point sometimes.

2841
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:02,691
Uh,

2842
01:10:02,691 --> 01:10:04,160
but I didn't want to have my,

2843
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:04,980
uh,

2844
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:07,340
backbreaking 90 to
where he get any points.

2845
01:10:07,550 --> 01:10:08,450
So just let it keep fighting,

2846
01:10:08,451 --> 01:10:08,691
fighting,

2847
01:10:08,691 --> 01:10:08,931
fighting,

2848
01:10:08,931 --> 01:10:09,171
fighting,

2849
01:10:09,171 --> 01:10:09,860
fighting.

2850
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:13,180
And I tried to to do this hot thing
and whenever I went to do the hop hit,

2851
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:14,930
that's whenever all his
weight came down on it.

2852
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:16,190
Super Experience Guy.

2853
01:10:16,191 --> 01:10:16,911
He's like 33,

2854
01:10:16,911 --> 01:10:20,360
34 and I was 18 at the Olympic training
center where he was world champion and

2855
01:10:20,361 --> 01:10:24,770
Olympic bronze or silver medalist and it
just snapped it whenever it snapped and

2856
01:10:24,771 --> 01:10:26,300
went completely behind my back.

2857
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:29,150
One of my buddies at the Olympic
training center puked because of it.

2858
01:10:29,151 --> 01:10:29,930
And uh,

2859
01:10:29,930 --> 01:10:32,150
so I was laying on it
completely behind my back.

2860
01:10:32,150 --> 01:10:33,140
Like if I was on the bet,

2861
01:10:33,450 --> 01:10:35,720
the mat right now is
completely behind my back,

2862
01:10:36,230 --> 01:10:37,280
except it was this way.

2863
01:10:37,710 --> 01:10:41,210
So it was show part of this
whole part of my heart is wicked.

2864
01:10:41,211 --> 01:10:42,950
This whole part of my
arm was under my back,

2865
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,050
so it broke it,

2866
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:48,500
it dislocated it and it tore the
old Neri collateral ligament.

2867
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:49,431
Um,

2868
01:10:49,431 --> 01:10:51,800
so they did a nerve transposition.

2869
01:10:51,801 --> 01:10:52,990
So I have no more funny bone.

2870
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:53,720
Uh,

2871
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:55,010
they moved it to where it's right here.

2872
01:10:55,011 --> 01:10:56,300
So if I talk on the phone too long,

2873
01:10:56,301 --> 01:10:58,220
these three nerves go numb or I'm sorry,

2874
01:10:58,221 --> 01:10:59,270
these three fingers go numb.

2875
01:10:59,710 --> 01:11:00,130
Uh,

2876
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:01,670
and then they took a,

2877
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:02,510
they were going to do,

2878
01:11:02,510 --> 01:11:03,430
is it a cadaver?

2879
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:04,190
Cadaver?

2880
01:11:04,190 --> 01:11:04,940
Cadaver.

2881
01:11:04,940 --> 01:11:05,570
Cadaver.

2882
01:11:05,570 --> 01:11:09,360
So they were going to use a
cadaver nerves that Zombie show?

2883
01:11:09,510 --> 01:11:09,870
No,

2884
01:11:09,870 --> 01:11:10,070
no.

2885
01:11:10,070 --> 01:11:11,450
For the torn ligament,

2886
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:12,171
the UCL,

2887
01:11:12,171 --> 01:11:13,010
the ordinary collateral.

2888
01:11:13,890 --> 01:11:15,330
But then instead they use the,

2889
01:11:15,331 --> 01:11:16,164
uh,

2890
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:19,370
there's like three tendons in your
hamstring that are kind of like this.

2891
01:11:19,370 --> 01:11:22,460
And he took the center one out and
they said a tendon is stronger than the

2892
01:11:22,461 --> 01:11:23,250
ligament.

2893
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:23,491
And like,

2894
01:11:23,491 --> 01:11:24,510
we want to put some strong in there.

2895
01:11:24,511 --> 01:11:26,730
If you're wanting to be an
Olympic caliber athlete,

2896
01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:27,900
um,

2897
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:30,350
and they said that that was actually
maybe a harder chance for it to,

2898
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:31,253
to take,

2899
01:11:31,410 --> 01:11:31,770
um,

2900
01:11:31,770 --> 01:11:33,900
but it was the best chance
to take instead of a cadaver,

2901
01:11:33,901 --> 01:11:34,930
which might be weaker,

2902
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:36,990
smaller person than your
body could reject it.

2903
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:37,853
Right.

2904
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:42,920
Dominick Cruz nine brutal blows it out,

2905
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:44,010
has to do it all over again.

2906
01:11:44,070 --> 01:11:44,460
Yup.

2907
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:45,161
And so they,

2908
01:11:45,161 --> 01:11:47,040
they wanted to use that
tending cause of stronger,

2909
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:47,471
and he said,

2910
01:11:47,471 --> 01:11:48,450
and it's going to be from your leg.

2911
01:11:48,451 --> 01:11:48,751
And he goes,

2912
01:11:48,751 --> 01:11:49,630
and you want to fight Sunday?

2913
01:11:49,650 --> 01:11:49,891
And I go,

2914
01:11:49,891 --> 01:11:50,131
yeah.

2915
01:11:50,131 --> 01:11:50,940
And he said,

2916
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:51,091
well,

2917
01:11:51,091 --> 01:11:52,910
this will be like you're kicking
someone in the face then.

2918
01:11:53,370 --> 01:11:53,821
And I'm like,

2919
01:11:53,821 --> 01:11:54,181
okay,

2920
01:11:54,181 --> 01:11:55,200
that sounds pretty sweet.

2921
01:11:55,590 --> 01:11:55,951
Uh,

2922
01:11:55,951 --> 01:11:56,850
but yeah,

2923
01:11:56,851 --> 01:11:59,190
so that's whenever the drug
problem probably started.

2924
01:11:59,191 --> 01:12:00,750
I remember I was,

2925
01:12:00,810 --> 01:12:02,190
I was piggy back and even then,

2926
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:02,710
um,

2927
01:12:02,710 --> 01:12:05,130
kind of started going into
depression because I thought,

2928
01:12:05,490 --> 01:12:05,940
man,

2929
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:08,730
did I just lose my Olympic
dreams and my MMA dreams?

2930
01:12:09,150 --> 01:12:09,331
Uh,

2931
01:12:09,331 --> 01:12:09,631
so,

2932
01:12:09,631 --> 01:12:11,300
and I was doing all the oxycodone.

2933
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:13,170
The how old were you at this
time when you hurt yourself?

2934
01:12:13,171 --> 01:12:13,431
18.

2935
01:12:13,431 --> 01:12:13,850
18.

2936
01:12:13,850 --> 01:12:14,190
Yeah.

2937
01:12:14,190 --> 01:12:15,360
So you're 18 years old.

2938
01:12:15,361 --> 01:12:16,860
No drug problem before.

2939
01:12:16,890 --> 01:12:17,340
No,

2940
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:18,180
get on the pills.

2941
01:12:18,181 --> 01:12:20,700
And I had smoked some
weed before and I drank,

2942
01:12:20,701 --> 01:12:21,750
but not as never,

2943
01:12:22,110 --> 01:12:23,880
no nothing where I had to have anything.

2944
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:26,000
People in my family that
have had the same issue,

2945
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:30,030
guy got injured and all of a sudden taking
pills for his back and he's a fucking

2946
01:12:30,031 --> 01:12:30,630
loser now.

2947
01:12:30,630 --> 01:12:30,811
I mean,

2948
01:12:30,811 --> 01:12:31,500
he's just gone.

2949
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:33,300
It was a normal guy and now he's a loser.

2950
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:37,650
And I've met so many people that know
somebody that has that same story or that

2951
01:12:37,651 --> 01:12:40,830
have that same story and then like
you pulled themselves out of it.

2952
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,090
It's so terrifying.

2953
01:12:42,290 --> 01:12:45,600
It's so terrifying how they're just
handing out some of the most addictive

2954
01:12:45,601 --> 01:12:47,460
medication that the world has ever known.

2955
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:48,930
That that really is what it is.

2956
01:12:49,030 --> 01:12:49,471
It's brutal,

2957
01:12:49,471 --> 01:12:49,700
man.

2958
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:49,830
I,

2959
01:12:49,830 --> 01:12:51,090
I owe and it's heroin.

2960
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:51,610
Yeah.

2961
01:12:51,610 --> 01:12:52,980
And I know drive on it.

2962
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:54,920
I would a man I,

2963
01:12:54,921 --> 01:12:56,010
and I know that's,

2964
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:56,821
hey,

2965
01:12:56,821 --> 01:12:58,110
you should have that reaction.

2966
01:12:58,111 --> 01:12:58,231
I,

2967
01:12:58,231 --> 01:13:01,430
I have that reaction to me now
looking back at my life and,

2968
01:13:01,431 --> 01:13:01,800
and,

2969
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:02,460
and just,

2970
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:02,701
I mean,

2971
01:13:02,701 --> 01:13:03,000
I dunno,

2972
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,050
thank God that I didn't,

2973
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:06,930
I didn't kill somebody or a family or,

2974
01:13:06,931 --> 01:13:09,810
but I remember the time that
I really wanted to end it.

2975
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:13,150
I just took a handful of the hydrocarbons.

2976
01:13:13,230 --> 01:13:13,650
Um,

2977
01:13:13,650 --> 01:13:14,820
I was taking Adderall to,

2978
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:15,620
uh,

2979
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:15,790
I,

2980
01:13:15,790 --> 01:13:16,540
and then I was,

2981
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:17,373
uh,

2982
01:13:17,610 --> 01:13:18,870
drinking straight.

2983
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:19,291
I'm actually,

2984
01:13:19,291 --> 01:13:20,041
I didn't drink it straight,

2985
01:13:20,041 --> 01:13:20,871
but I had it,

2986
01:13:20,871 --> 01:13:21,480
uh,

2987
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:22,560
in a Sonic Cup,

2988
01:13:22,590 --> 01:13:23,760
but it was ever clear,

2989
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:25,610
like a strawberry slushy up,

2990
01:13:25,611 --> 01:13:28,170
brutal and knows how to party.

2991
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:29,003
I told you about the,

2992
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:30,420
he's got a dead pig on his shoulder.

2993
01:13:31,050 --> 01:13:32,010
I got to hang out with.

2994
01:13:32,110 --> 01:13:32,943
And then I was,

2995
01:13:33,030 --> 01:13:34,170
I had my tinctures.

2996
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:34,990
Tinctures are,

2997
01:13:34,990 --> 01:13:35,230
yeah.

2998
01:13:35,230 --> 01:13:36,720
And so I had those and um,

2999
01:13:36,810 --> 01:13:40,500
and so I just took it all and
driving and I blacked out.

3000
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:41,471
Oh yeah.

3001
01:13:41,471 --> 01:13:42,480
What a confusion.

3002
01:13:42,481 --> 01:13:42,991
Your mind,

3003
01:13:42,991 --> 01:13:45,480
you had a civil war
going on in your brain?

3004
01:13:45,510 --> 01:13:45,901
I did.

3005
01:13:45,901 --> 01:13:47,580
And I blacked out driving and,

3006
01:13:47,581 --> 01:13:48,180
uh,

3007
01:13:48,180 --> 01:13:48,981
I do what?

3008
01:13:48,981 --> 01:13:53,850
I've been so low that have woke up in
a drug house up in kind of a outside on

3009
01:13:53,851 --> 01:13:55,170
the outskirts of summit county.

3010
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:55,620
Um,

3011
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:56,090
and uh,

3012
01:13:56,090 --> 01:13:56,280
it will,

3013
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:57,690
you still usually live in boulder?

3014
01:13:57,710 --> 01:13:58,190
Yeah.

3015
01:13:58,190 --> 01:13:58,381
Yeah.

3016
01:13:58,381 --> 01:14:01,890
So you know where summit county is then
with like Breckenridge and keystone.

3017
01:14:02,410 --> 01:14:04,390
So we'll go up on me and I loved it.

3018
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:05,400
Yeah.

3019
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:05,731
I wish,

3020
01:14:05,731 --> 01:14:06,564
uh,

3021
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:06,810
yeah,

3022
01:14:06,810 --> 01:14:07,740
I'm in Texas right now,

3023
01:14:07,741 --> 01:14:09,300
so Congo is going to be beautiful too,

3024
01:14:09,301 --> 01:14:11,290
but I miss scholar is another level.

3025
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:11,580
Yeah.

3026
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:13,270
It goes a different level of life.

3027
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:15,430
It's like so vibrant and green,

3028
01:14:15,730 --> 01:14:16,920
rainy and everything that,

3029
01:14:17,770 --> 01:14:18,491
I don't know if you know this,

3030
01:14:18,491 --> 01:14:20,920
this is a completely different subject.

3031
01:14:20,921 --> 01:14:22,060
But in Uganda,

3032
01:14:22,510 --> 01:14:24,340
right on the border of where I'm at,

3033
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:25,390
there's,

3034
01:14:25,390 --> 01:14:28,510
it's on the equator is the jungle.

3035
01:14:28,730 --> 01:14:29,110
Um,

3036
01:14:29,110 --> 01:14:31,230
but there's mountains that
are so high that there,

3037
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:32,440
I think the only,

3038
01:14:32,870 --> 01:14:33,703
uh,

3039
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:36,310
glaciers that you can find on the equator.

3040
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:38,740
So there's like actual glaciers in Uganda,

3041
01:14:38,741 --> 01:14:40,330
in Africa on the equation,

3042
01:14:40,331 --> 01:14:42,130
the equator right outside the jungle.

3043
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:43,620
That,

3044
01:14:43,620 --> 01:14:44,453
so there's glaciers.

3045
01:14:44,470 --> 01:14:45,490
That's insane.

3046
01:14:45,491 --> 01:14:46,120
Yeah.

3047
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:46,891
So anyways,

3048
01:14:46,891 --> 01:14:47,890
that's completely random.

3049
01:14:48,010 --> 01:14:49,630
What made you straighten up?

3050
01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:50,980
What made you sober up?

3051
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:53,560
I knew I was going to die.

3052
01:14:53,790 --> 01:14:53,890
Well,

3053
01:14:53,890 --> 01:14:54,723
that was one thing.

3054
01:14:54,820 --> 01:14:55,653
Uh,

3055
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:57,260
how did you do and you clean up?

3056
01:14:59,350 --> 01:15:00,190
Uh,

3057
01:15:00,790 --> 01:15:02,620
for me personally,

3058
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:03,580
um,

3059
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:06,610
I had this guy that that
was just brutal man.

3060
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:09,610
He a brutal in a way.

3061
01:15:09,611 --> 01:15:10,630
Like he was relentless.

3062
01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:11,920
He was just coming after me,

3063
01:15:11,921 --> 01:15:12,191
man,

3064
01:15:12,191 --> 01:15:14,080
saying that I had a purpose to live for,

3065
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:14,980
um,

3066
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:15,730
saying that,

3067
01:15:15,730 --> 01:15:16,260
you know,

3068
01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:16,600
uh,

3069
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:17,920
he told me this and I remember,

3070
01:15:17,921 --> 01:15:20,470
I'll always remember this is
my buddy named Jeff Donkey.

3071
01:15:20,471 --> 01:15:21,370
He'll probably be watching this.

3072
01:15:21,371 --> 01:15:22,570
He's an awesome dude.

3073
01:15:22,571 --> 01:15:23,980
Man has a great family,

3074
01:15:23,981 --> 01:15:24,491
great wife,

3075
01:15:24,491 --> 01:15:25,324
great kids.

3076
01:15:25,590 --> 01:15:26,050
Um,

3077
01:15:26,050 --> 01:15:26,561
and he told me,

3078
01:15:26,561 --> 01:15:26,981
Justin,

3079
01:15:26,981 --> 01:15:28,270
you're in the battle for your life.

3080
01:15:28,271 --> 01:15:29,104
Like if you,

3081
01:15:29,710 --> 01:15:31,240
this life is a battle ground,

3082
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:32,200
not a playground.

3083
01:15:32,410 --> 01:15:33,730
If you treat it like a playground,

3084
01:15:33,731 --> 01:15:35,380
you will lose the battle.

3085
01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:37,780
And then he started talking like,

3086
01:15:37,781 --> 01:15:39,340
what's your game plan for victory here?

3087
01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:39,731
And I'm like,

3088
01:15:39,731 --> 01:15:39,911
man,

3089
01:15:39,911 --> 01:15:40,900
I got a perfect game plan,

3090
01:15:40,901 --> 01:15:41,171
right?

3091
01:15:41,171 --> 01:15:41,411
Like,

3092
01:15:41,411 --> 01:15:41,800
I mean,

3093
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:43,390
thank God that guy didn't find Brian.

3094
01:15:44,330 --> 01:15:44,891
You'd be like,

3095
01:15:44,891 --> 01:15:45,011
well,

3096
01:15:45,011 --> 01:15:45,970
I'm no,

3097
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:46,541
no,

3098
01:15:46,541 --> 01:15:46,990
I'm not.

3099
01:15:46,990 --> 01:15:47,321
No,

3100
01:15:47,321 --> 01:15:48,154
no battle.

3101
01:15:49,990 --> 01:15:50,860
I'm here to play.

3102
01:15:52,010 --> 01:15:52,300
Fuck.

3103
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:53,111
What am I going to lose?

3104
01:15:53,111 --> 01:15:54,220
That eating too much pussy.

3105
01:15:57,610 --> 01:15:58,740
And so he told,

3106
01:15:58,741 --> 01:16:01,420
he told you that you have
to find your purpose.

3107
01:16:01,450 --> 01:16:01,750
Yeah,

3108
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:03,630
he said I had to find a purpose
and that I had a purpose.

3109
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:04,660
What does this gentleman do?

3110
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:05,800
Um,

3111
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:06,633
he's a Roofer,

3112
01:16:07,060 --> 01:16:09,890
so he's a childhood friend and uh,

3113
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:10,211
not,

3114
01:16:10,211 --> 01:16:10,570
uh,

3115
01:16:10,570 --> 01:16:11,500
actually he's even older.

3116
01:16:11,501 --> 01:16:13,990
Like I had some family friends in a debt,

3117
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:17,170
a guy that was like a second dad to me
and his kids are some of my best friends.

3118
01:16:17,171 --> 01:16:18,190
And um,

3119
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:19,390
and Jeff was kind of in that,

3120
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:20,410
that core group,

3121
01:16:20,411 --> 01:16:22,170
but he had heard through the grapevine,

3122
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:22,810
uh,

3123
01:16:22,810 --> 01:16:26,110
that my mom had come and checked on me
and that like two and a half period.

3124
01:16:26,620 --> 01:16:27,250
And I think my,

3125
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:28,061
my dad might've came,

3126
01:16:28,061 --> 01:16:28,241
but,

3127
01:16:28,241 --> 01:16:28,930
uh,

3128
01:16:28,930 --> 01:16:32,680
but she had broken into my house
that was in color and not broken in,

3129
01:16:32,681 --> 01:16:34,810
but she just was able to
get through the back door,

3130
01:16:35,410 --> 01:16:36,241
saw the drug,

3131
01:16:36,241 --> 01:16:37,260
saw the pills,

3132
01:16:37,261 --> 01:16:38,350
saw how has living,

3133
01:16:38,351 --> 01:16:40,960
and it looked like hoarders
or just just filthy.

3134
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:42,130
Um,

3135
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:45,850
and so she knew that he might be one guy
that could get to me and get through to

3136
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:46,031
me.

3137
01:16:46,031 --> 01:16:47,920
And so he called me every
single day for two months.

3138
01:16:47,950 --> 01:16:48,783
I mean called me,

3139
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:49,810
left me a voicemail,

3140
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:53,170
text me and email me
and was pissing me off.

3141
01:16:53,171 --> 01:16:53,500
Man.

3142
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:54,830
I was getting livid with them.

3143
01:16:55,900 --> 01:16:57,910
And then whenever I got
kicked off a grudge,

3144
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,520
I got up to my phone and
it got out to my car.

3145
01:17:00,521 --> 01:17:01,690
I was like an angry tears.

3146
01:17:01,691 --> 01:17:02,524
I didn't know what to do.

3147
01:17:02,980 --> 01:17:03,400
Um,

3148
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:05,380
because like I was living my dream,

3149
01:17:05,650 --> 01:17:08,680
but it was a nightmare
and my dream was reality.

3150
01:17:08,681 --> 01:17:10,160
But it was literally a nightmare.

3151
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:10,371
Right?

3152
01:17:10,371 --> 01:17:12,550
You're living your dream as
a competitive MMA fighter,

3153
01:17:12,570 --> 01:17:13,610
but you're also a drug.

3154
01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:14,170
I had,

3155
01:17:14,170 --> 01:17:15,950
I had transform successfully,

3156
01:17:15,951 --> 01:17:19,460
I guess we can go back that I transformed
successfully from that 13 year old

3157
01:17:19,461 --> 01:17:21,440
loser that was invited to the parties.

3158
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:25,130
And now I was that maybe quote
unquote modern day gladiator,

3159
01:17:25,131 --> 01:17:25,821
ultimate fighter,

3160
01:17:25,821 --> 01:17:27,350
mixed martial artist and uh,

3161
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:29,390
and somehow I wasn't fulfilled.

3162
01:17:29,391 --> 01:17:33,770
Somehow I was a depressed
drug addict and um,

3163
01:17:34,670 --> 01:17:36,080
and whenever I got to my car,

3164
01:17:36,081 --> 01:17:38,330
I had a text message,

3165
01:17:38,331 --> 01:17:38,721
voicemail,

3166
01:17:38,721 --> 01:17:40,100
all this other stuff then
want to hear from him.

3167
01:17:40,101 --> 01:17:42,770
But the text message said
this was when your iPhone,

3168
01:17:42,771 --> 01:17:44,180
it didn't just say text message on it,

3169
01:17:44,210 --> 01:17:48,230
it would say like the actual message and
on the actual message on the screen it

3170
01:17:48,231 --> 01:17:49,280
said check her email,

3171
01:17:50,390 --> 01:17:51,350
checked my email.

3172
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:55,370
The very first thing said
a game plan for victory.

3173
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:56,570
Um,

3174
01:17:56,570 --> 01:17:59,240
and then whenever I opened it up it said
the best thing you'll ever do in your

3175
01:17:59,241 --> 01:18:00,074
life.

3176
01:18:00,190 --> 01:18:00,500
Uh,

3177
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:05,030
and it was a trip that was paid for and
I thought it was maybe like a a detox

3178
01:18:05,090 --> 01:18:07,940
detox kind of thing or a
rehab or something like that.

3179
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:09,381
So I was interested in,

3180
01:18:09,381 --> 01:18:10,940
I just got kicked off of grudge.

3181
01:18:11,570 --> 01:18:13,280
I think Trevor was the only guy,

3182
01:18:13,281 --> 01:18:14,150
maybe Brendan?

3183
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:15,111
No,

3184
01:18:15,111 --> 01:18:17,390
I think there was like
30 guys or something.

3185
01:18:17,391 --> 01:18:20,930
They got there early to vote on the day
of sparring to vote if I stay a part of

3186
01:18:20,931 --> 01:18:25,280
the team because some of the
guys that had it with me and Ti,

3187
01:18:25,310 --> 01:18:27,530
coach t brought me into
his office and he said,

3188
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:27,980
Bro,

3189
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:30,320
like we can't have our name
attached to you anymore.

3190
01:18:30,350 --> 01:18:31,183
Like,

3191
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:33,350
I'm the only guy that
once you still a party,

3192
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:34,161
I could veto it.

3193
01:18:34,161 --> 01:18:35,150
Maybe I'm the head coach,

3194
01:18:35,151 --> 01:18:38,720
but I'm not going to go
against the guys and grudges.

3195
01:18:38,721 --> 01:18:39,321
Unique man,

3196
01:18:39,321 --> 01:18:40,310
because grudges,

3197
01:18:40,610 --> 01:18:41,450
it's a family.

3198
01:18:41,630 --> 01:18:41,871
I mean,

3199
01:18:41,871 --> 01:18:43,250
then what I mean like it's,

3200
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:44,353
it's like the,

3201
01:18:44,570 --> 01:18:45,640
I think for Elliot Marshall,

3202
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:48,440
we threw a surprise baby shower for him.

3203
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:49,401
I mean,

3204
01:18:49,401 --> 01:18:51,890
in fighters throwing a
baby shower for a fighter,

3205
01:18:51,891 --> 01:18:52,221
you know,

3206
01:18:52,221 --> 01:18:53,390
like that's just not normal.

3207
01:18:53,390 --> 01:18:55,250
And a lot of fight gyms are there.

3208
01:18:55,251 --> 01:18:57,790
A bunch of gym hoppers and a bunch of
selfish dudes and they're never going to

3209
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:59,350
give the coach to the money
or they're never gonna.

3210
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:01,220
They're gonna try to knock
out their training partners.

3211
01:19:01,221 --> 01:19:01,521
Like we,

3212
01:19:01,521 --> 01:19:03,950
we just worked like a
head cookouts together,

3213
01:19:03,951 --> 01:19:04,790
all this different stuff.

3214
01:19:04,791 --> 01:19:07,560
But I was the one guy that was a,

3215
01:19:07,561 --> 01:19:08,420
that was the problem.

3216
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:09,261
And uh,

3217
01:19:09,261 --> 01:19:11,540
they voted me off and
so me and I was just,

3218
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:12,021
I was empty.

3219
01:19:12,021 --> 01:19:12,441
I felt like,

3220
01:19:12,441 --> 01:19:13,160
man,

3221
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:15,230
now my dream or my nightmare,

3222
01:19:15,231 --> 01:19:17,540
but my dream now that's
even ripped away from me.

3223
01:19:17,570 --> 01:19:18,470
So now I had nothing,

3224
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:19,041
you know?

3225
01:19:19,041 --> 01:19:21,920
I know that you've gone
through some growth as a human,

3226
01:19:21,921 --> 01:19:22,754
as a man,

3227
01:19:22,970 --> 01:19:25,580
some spiritual development and
character building and all that.

3228
01:19:25,581 --> 01:19:30,581
But I can't help but be terrified at
how smart you are and how to gather and

3229
01:19:31,641 --> 01:19:32,510
passionate you are.

3230
01:19:32,630 --> 01:19:35,330
But yet you still got hooked
by these fucking pills.

3231
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:38,030
Those goddamn things
scare the shit out of me.

3232
01:19:38,031 --> 01:19:42,050
And I know you were a younger
man at the time and you didn't,

3233
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:44,330
you didn't have the life
experiences that you have now,

3234
01:19:44,331 --> 01:19:45,740
but you're not a loser.

3235
01:19:45,770 --> 01:19:48,560
So the fact that you got just
sucked up into it like that,

3236
01:19:48,561 --> 01:19:48,821
it's,

3237
01:19:48,821 --> 01:19:50,180
it's so terrifying to me.

3238
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:50,891
Yeah.

3239
01:19:50,891 --> 01:19:51,161
I mean,

3240
01:19:51,161 --> 01:19:51,431
they're,

3241
01:19:51,431 --> 01:19:52,360
they're dangerous man.

3242
01:19:52,361 --> 01:19:53,194
I think they should.

3243
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:54,340
I don't know how they could,

3244
01:19:54,370 --> 01:19:54,791
they could,

3245
01:19:54,791 --> 01:19:55,270
uh,

3246
01:19:55,270 --> 01:19:56,200
watch it better.

3247
01:19:56,260 --> 01:19:56,690
You know?

3248
01:19:56,690 --> 01:19:56,960
I mean,

3249
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:57,270
I,

3250
01:19:57,270 --> 01:20:01,240
I shouldn't be able to go to three
different doctors and have one given me a

3251
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:02,073
hundred at a time.

3252
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:02,831
I mean,

3253
01:20:02,831 --> 01:20:03,664
you know what I mean,

3254
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:04,210
hundred,

3255
01:20:04,210 --> 01:20:05,410
this is going to Colorado.

3256
01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:06,070
Yeah.

3257
01:20:06,070 --> 01:20:06,903
At least they have.

3258
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:07,920
I mean,

3259
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:10,020
I literally just go to
three different pharmacies,

3260
01:20:10,021 --> 01:20:10,854
three different doctors,

3261
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:11,760
three different doctors to be,

3262
01:20:11,761 --> 01:20:16,440
that was the whole topic of a vanguard
show called the oxycontin express.

3263
01:20:16,470 --> 01:20:17,303
Oh,

3264
01:20:17,490 --> 01:20:18,180
I was on it.

3265
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:19,620
I was off the board at the man.

3266
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:21,150
I was taking the train.

3267
01:20:21,210 --> 01:20:22,320
It's about Florida.

3268
01:20:23,090 --> 01:20:23,671
It's Florida.

3269
01:20:23,671 --> 01:20:27,720
Had these things calls up pain management
centers where you would go to a doctor

3270
01:20:27,870 --> 01:20:28,950
and the doctor would say,

3271
01:20:28,951 --> 01:20:29,440
what's wrong?

3272
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,151
I hurt my back.

3273
01:20:30,151 --> 01:20:30,420
What?

3274
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:31,620
You need a prescription for pain pills.

3275
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,900
So the doctor writes it in the
same facility right next to that,

3276
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:36,120
you leave the doctor's door.

3277
01:20:36,180 --> 01:20:39,540
The next door is the pharmacy
that only sells oxycontin.

3278
01:20:39,810 --> 01:20:42,750
You go in there and you buy pain
pills and they have these fucking pain

3279
01:20:42,751 --> 01:20:44,940
management centers and
they're all over the place.

3280
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:49,200
So you essentially have these
oxycontin addicts waiting in line it,

3281
01:20:49,201 --> 01:20:51,420
all these parking lots
to get into these places.

3282
01:20:51,421 --> 01:20:52,860
And the places was filled.

3283
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:56,400
They were filled with poor people that
were just hooked on these goddamn pills.

3284
01:20:56,490 --> 01:20:56,880
And I think,

3285
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:57,720
I think for me,

3286
01:20:57,750 --> 01:20:58,460
uh,

3287
01:20:58,460 --> 01:20:58,590
uh,

3288
01:20:58,590 --> 01:21:00,180
mean I appreciate you saying like,

3289
01:21:00,181 --> 01:21:00,421
you know,

3290
01:21:00,421 --> 01:21:01,350
you're not a loser.

3291
01:21:01,351 --> 01:21:02,400
Smart guy or whatever.

3292
01:21:02,401 --> 01:21:03,450
I think it's true.

3293
01:21:03,451 --> 01:21:03,661
I mean,

3294
01:21:03,661 --> 01:21:04,680
I'm listening to you talk,

3295
01:21:04,681 --> 01:21:04,861
you're,

3296
01:21:04,861 --> 01:21:06,180
you're obviously a smart guy.

3297
01:21:06,420 --> 01:21:06,571
Well,

3298
01:21:06,571 --> 01:21:07,231
I appreciate that.

3299
01:21:07,231 --> 01:21:11,070
I think that worked in my
advantage for my problem.

3300
01:21:11,460 --> 01:21:11,731
Uh,

3301
01:21:11,731 --> 01:21:11,881
I,

3302
01:21:11,881 --> 01:21:12,630
if that makes sense.

3303
01:21:12,630 --> 01:21:12,751
Like,

3304
01:21:12,751 --> 01:21:12,831
it,

3305
01:21:12,831 --> 01:21:13,051
it,

3306
01:21:13,051 --> 01:21:13,250
it,

3307
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:13,890
it fed it.

3308
01:21:13,890 --> 01:21:15,750
I was able to justify it,

3309
01:21:15,980 --> 01:21:17,070
justify owning also,

3310
01:21:17,071 --> 01:21:19,620
but to the doctors even
like articulate it,

3311
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:23,670
I wasn't the same kind of guy they would
classify as we got to watch this guy.

3312
01:21:24,270 --> 01:21:25,470
He's a professional fighter.

3313
01:21:25,471 --> 01:21:27,030
He does have a bum elbow.

3314
01:21:27,060 --> 01:21:28,440
He's got a back problem.

3315
01:21:28,441 --> 01:21:29,274
He,

3316
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:29,940
uh,

3317
01:21:29,940 --> 01:21:30,181
yeah,

3318
01:21:30,181 --> 01:21:31,290
we can trust this guy.

3319
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:32,430
What was your back problem?

3320
01:21:32,980 --> 01:21:34,470
I actually,

3321
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:35,700
in my last fight,

3322
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:39,900
I a herniated one disk
and I bulged another.

3323
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:41,393
And so I have a,

3324
01:21:41,420 --> 01:21:44,050
I have an x ray that
they have a messed up,

3325
01:21:44,051 --> 01:21:44,160
uh,

3326
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:45,540
actually a bunch from the,

3327
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:47,460
mainly it was the thoracic,

3328
01:21:47,870 --> 01:21:48,691
the thoracic,

3329
01:21:48,691 --> 01:21:50,370
and then one or two of the lumbar.

3330
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:50,730
But,

3331
01:21:50,730 --> 01:21:51,150
um,

3332
01:21:51,150 --> 01:21:52,860
I have a x ray of,

3333
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,660
from those pain management places.

3334
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:58,740
I think I had six different
disk where they put these,

3335
01:21:58,741 --> 01:21:59,000
uh,

3336
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:03,570
injections into my spine of Cortisone,

3337
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:04,860
kind of like cortisone.

3338
01:22:04,890 --> 01:22:08,610
I'm trying to think of some sort of
steroid a little time for absolutely.

3339
01:22:08,710 --> 01:22:12,120
That was brutal because I was supposed
to be in a twilight kind of sleep and I

3340
01:22:12,121 --> 01:22:15,370
woke up during it because he hit
something and I just remembered just ah,

3341
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:15,760
uh,

3342
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:17,670
and then they put some
more in me and I was out.

3343
01:22:17,671 --> 01:22:17,990
But yeah,

3344
01:22:17,990 --> 01:22:20,140
I had a boss and in
here yesterday and his,

3345
01:22:20,470 --> 01:22:21,600
his right arm,

3346
01:22:21,810 --> 01:22:26,250
it's like shriveled away because of a
neck injuries cause the disc injuries.

3347
01:22:26,550 --> 01:22:28,530
I used to get stingers all
the time from wrestling.

3348
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:33,560
So it's so amazing how many guy you have
a bulging disc now and my neck and uh,

3349
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:37,250
it's amazing talking to how
many guys talking to people,

3350
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:40,770
asking how many guys also have the same
injury or a similar injuries were in

3351
01:22:40,771 --> 01:22:42,540
their lower back or in the middle backer.

3352
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:44,070
It's fucking everybody.

3353
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:44,850
Yeah,

3354
01:22:44,850 --> 01:22:45,683
it's crazy.

3355
01:22:45,810 --> 01:22:46,190
Yeah.

3356
01:22:46,190 --> 01:22:47,610
And I mean,

3357
01:22:47,611 --> 01:22:48,900
it's easy if you want to get,

3358
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:50,010
if you want to get it,

3359
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:50,933
uh,

3360
01:22:51,210 --> 01:22:51,691
you know,

3361
01:22:51,691 --> 01:22:52,950
fund your or whatever,

3362
01:22:52,951 --> 01:22:57,750
find your addiction and you want to
find a way to feed that and you can,

3363
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:00,360
if you want to find something
to take a pill for it,

3364
01:23:00,410 --> 01:23:00,680
they'll,

3365
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:00,960
they'll,

3366
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:01,710
they'll get you.

3367
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:02,161
Absolutely.

3368
01:23:02,161 --> 01:23:04,320
Even one of my doctors was an Iowa,

3369
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:05,231
so two,

3370
01:23:05,231 --> 01:23:06,130
we're in Colorado.

3371
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:06,993
One was an Iowa.

3372
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:07,853
We won't go there,

3373
01:23:09,130 --> 01:23:09,461
man.

3374
01:23:09,461 --> 01:23:09,851
That's a,

3375
01:23:09,851 --> 01:23:10,900
that's terrifying shit.

3376
01:23:10,901 --> 01:23:11,790
But it's a,

3377
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:15,370
for a lot of people out there that might
be struggling with that very problem

3378
01:23:15,371 --> 01:23:16,720
right now listening to this,

3379
01:23:17,020 --> 01:23:17,321
you know,

3380
01:23:17,321 --> 01:23:21,160
hearing you that you were able
to pull yourself out of it,

3381
01:23:21,250 --> 01:23:22,061
I guarantee you,

3382
01:23:22,061 --> 01:23:25,780
you can inspire people to do the same
when they can realize they listen to you

3383
01:23:25,781 --> 01:23:26,051
and go,

3384
01:23:26,051 --> 01:23:27,100
I want to be that guy.

3385
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:31,090
I don't want to be this guy that I'm now
a slave to his bottle of pills that I

3386
01:23:31,091 --> 01:23:32,590
have to figure out how to get every week.

3387
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:33,933
You know?

3388
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:36,880
I feel like that's one of the reasons
I have that connection to the pygmies.

3389
01:23:36,910 --> 01:23:37,240
Like,

3390
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:39,490
I wasn't a slave to a band too,

3391
01:23:39,820 --> 01:23:42,070
but I've bet I've definitely
been a slave to something.

3392
01:23:42,540 --> 01:23:43,060
Uh,

3393
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:43,840
and,

3394
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:44,531
and so yeah,

3395
01:23:44,531 --> 01:23:48,250
if there is somebody that's watching me
and that you can get out of it because,

3396
01:23:48,660 --> 01:23:49,060
um,

3397
01:23:49,060 --> 01:23:50,080
there's definitely hope.

3398
01:23:50,380 --> 01:23:50,980
How did you,

3399
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:51,581
how did you do it?

3400
01:23:51,581 --> 01:23:52,600
Did you go cold Turkey?

3401
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:53,980
Yeah.

3402
01:23:53,980 --> 01:23:54,430
Yeah.

3403
01:23:54,430 --> 01:23:54,731
Yeah.

3404
01:23:54,731 --> 01:23:55,421
I actually,

3405
01:23:55,421 --> 01:23:55,810
I went,

3406
01:23:55,810 --> 01:23:56,800
I ended up going on that,

3407
01:23:56,830 --> 01:23:57,310
uh,

3408
01:23:57,310 --> 01:24:01,450
that kind of retreat of sorts with
my buddy and he just loved on me,

3409
01:24:01,451 --> 01:24:01,751
man,

3410
01:24:01,751 --> 01:24:02,471
in a way that,

3411
01:24:02,471 --> 01:24:03,304
uh,

3412
01:24:03,730 --> 01:24:04,541
it was genuine.

3413
01:24:04,541 --> 01:24:05,470
It was authentic.

3414
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:06,261
Where was the retreat?

3415
01:24:06,261 --> 01:24:07,094
What did you guys do?

3416
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:09,970
Have you ever heard of the
hallmark family or hallmark cards?

3417
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:10,570
Sure.

3418
01:24:10,570 --> 01:24:11,880
I know they're big in Texas.

3419
01:24:11,900 --> 01:24:12,760
I don't know if they're not sure,

3420
01:24:12,940 --> 01:24:14,590
but it was actually their
house or their ranch.

3421
01:24:14,630 --> 01:24:15,130
Um,

3422
01:24:15,130 --> 01:24:15,963
and it was,

3423
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:20,800
they kind of donated this ranch
to be for all walks of life,

3424
01:24:20,860 --> 01:24:21,500
um,

3425
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:23,470
kind of all beliefs and
for people to come there.

3426
01:24:23,950 --> 01:24:24,370
And,

3427
01:24:24,370 --> 01:24:24,700
uh,

3428
01:24:24,700 --> 01:24:26,190
it was a vision of this one guy that,

3429
01:24:26,220 --> 01:24:29,740
that wants to just have a place where
people's lives can be changed and stuff.

3430
01:24:30,610 --> 01:24:30,970
Man,

3431
01:24:30,970 --> 01:24:31,510
there's these,

3432
01:24:31,510 --> 01:24:32,321
there's like 20,

3433
01:24:32,321 --> 01:24:35,640
30 guys that said that
they are not that said,

3434
01:24:35,641 --> 01:24:38,530
but they literally went
to war for me in my,

3435
01:24:38,531 --> 01:24:41,170
in my life and told me
how to life worth living.

3436
01:24:41,171 --> 01:24:41,710
And it was,

3437
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:42,521
it was awkward,

3438
01:24:42,521 --> 01:24:42,910
kind of,

3439
01:24:42,910 --> 01:24:43,691
not awkward,

3440
01:24:43,691 --> 01:24:44,111
but just right.

3441
01:24:44,111 --> 01:24:44,621
At first I was like,

3442
01:24:44,621 --> 01:24:45,161
what's up here?

3443
01:24:45,161 --> 01:24:45,994
This is crazy.

3444
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:47,193
Um,

3445
01:24:47,350 --> 01:24:48,040
but for me,

3446
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:48,970
I had a,

3447
01:24:49,030 --> 01:24:50,260
I had a radical change,

3448
01:24:50,261 --> 01:24:50,440
man.

3449
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:51,190
It wasn't a,

3450
01:24:51,190 --> 01:24:52,240
it wasn't a,

3451
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:54,220
it wasn't a slow process.

3452
01:24:54,370 --> 01:24:57,640
It was like I finally realized
I have a life worth living,

3453
01:24:58,330 --> 01:24:58,900
um,

3454
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:01,810
in my life can be for a
bigger purpose than myself.

3455
01:25:02,330 --> 01:25:04,120
Then getting what I want when I want it.

3456
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:05,233
Um,

3457
01:25:05,290 --> 01:25:07,150
I can make a contribution to this planet,

3458
01:25:07,151 --> 01:25:07,751
to this world,

3459
01:25:07,751 --> 01:25:08,584
to people.

3460
01:25:08,790 --> 01:25:09,400
Um,

3461
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:11,170
I can not just fight against people.

3462
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:12,430
I can fight for people.

3463
01:25:12,490 --> 01:25:15,340
And that's what it was demonstrated
in front of me at this retreat.

3464
01:25:15,910 --> 01:25:16,540
Um,

3465
01:25:16,540 --> 01:25:16,871
and I'm,

3466
01:25:16,871 --> 01:25:17,920
I'm not man.

3467
01:25:18,010 --> 01:25:19,150
I have my own personal beliefs.

3468
01:25:19,151 --> 01:25:19,620
Everyone does,

3469
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:19,950
man.

3470
01:25:19,950 --> 01:25:20,260
Uh,

3471
01:25:20,260 --> 01:25:21,093
but this was a,

3472
01:25:21,790 --> 01:25:25,600
it was a Christian retreat
and for me it changed my life,

3473
01:25:25,601 --> 01:25:25,870
man.

3474
01:25:25,870 --> 01:25:26,470
Because,

3475
01:25:26,470 --> 01:25:27,010
uh,

3476
01:25:27,010 --> 01:25:28,210
these men weren't like,

3477
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:28,781
because Bro,

3478
01:25:28,781 --> 01:25:31,120
if you want to go into some
jacked up religious background,

3479
01:25:31,121 --> 01:25:31,900
I got it.

3480
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:34,060
I've got a jacked up religious background.

3481
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:34,900
Um,

3482
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:36,430
I have family that says if,

3483
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:40,210
I mean just crazy stuff like you
have instruments in your music,

3484
01:25:40,211 --> 01:25:41,770
you go to hell if you have tattoos,

3485
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:43,990
you got to have them only
tattooed guy and my family.

3486
01:25:44,290 --> 01:25:44,800
Um,

3487
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:46,150
and I have a whole back piece and,

3488
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:46,770
and,

3489
01:25:46,770 --> 01:25:47,740
and all this stuff.

3490
01:25:47,741 --> 01:25:48,730
And I had another one where,

3491
01:25:49,270 --> 01:25:53,470
so they're super like legalistic
and this rules and this other one,

3492
01:25:53,471 --> 01:25:54,370
when I'm 13 years old,

3493
01:25:54,371 --> 01:25:55,990
I left up a church camp.

3494
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:56,741
When we church camp,

3495
01:25:56,741 --> 01:25:57,574
I ever went to,

3496
01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:58,660
I left the church camp,

3497
01:25:58,661 --> 01:26:01,360
have bruises on my neck because
they tried to cast demons out of me.

3498
01:26:01,770 --> 01:26:02,110
Um,

3499
01:26:02,110 --> 01:26:02,710
and then,

3500
01:26:02,710 --> 01:26:03,130
yeah,

3501
01:26:03,130 --> 01:26:03,470
yeah.

3502
01:26:03,470 --> 01:26:06,860
And then I went to Catholic
school and had a background where,

3503
01:26:06,861 --> 01:26:07,311
you know,

3504
01:26:07,311 --> 01:26:07,620
the,

3505
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:11,360
the parents were throwing keg parties
for us and then only there in this place

3506
01:26:11,361 --> 01:26:12,081
and this retreat.

3507
01:26:12,081 --> 01:26:13,040
And I told the guy,

3508
01:26:13,610 --> 01:26:13,821
Bro,

3509
01:26:13,821 --> 01:26:16,250
I don't need anything Christian,

3510
01:26:16,490 --> 01:26:16,701
Bro.

3511
01:26:16,701 --> 01:26:17,534
I don't need it.

3512
01:26:17,570 --> 01:26:18,403
I don't want it.

3513
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:18,950
Uh,

3514
01:26:18,950 --> 01:26:20,090
I know your type,

3515
01:26:20,150 --> 01:26:25,150
like if I sit around the campfire and
hold hands with a bunch of sissies punks

3516
01:26:25,461 --> 01:26:27,290
and sissies and sing Kumbaya,

3517
01:26:27,291 --> 01:26:28,040
what does that,

3518
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:29,420
what is that going to do for me?

3519
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:30,590
I need a real answer.

3520
01:26:30,650 --> 01:26:34,070
I need some like real hope and me and
the guy gave me an answer where it was

3521
01:26:34,071 --> 01:26:34,311
like,

3522
01:26:34,311 --> 01:26:34,960
you know,

3523
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:39,200
a real people with real problems
could really use a real god.

3524
01:26:39,630 --> 01:26:40,463
Um,

3525
01:26:40,490 --> 01:26:43,040
and for me that just
kind of struck a chord.

3526
01:26:43,041 --> 01:26:44,150
He told me that if you,

3527
01:26:44,570 --> 01:26:45,231
and this is again,

3528
01:26:45,231 --> 01:26:46,250
this is my beliefs and stuff,

3529
01:26:46,251 --> 01:26:47,960
so I'm not throwing anything
out there on anybody,

3530
01:26:47,961 --> 01:26:48,794
but he told me,

3531
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:49,720
um,

3532
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:50,690
and it made sense to me.

3533
01:26:51,020 --> 01:26:54,590
You've experienced the counterfeit
and for counterfeit to me,

3534
01:26:54,591 --> 01:26:54,921
anything,

3535
01:26:54,921 --> 01:26:56,030
there's gotta be an authentic.

3536
01:26:56,450 --> 01:26:56,971
And he told me,

3537
01:26:56,971 --> 01:26:57,111
you know,

3538
01:26:57,111 --> 01:27:00,590
if there's going to be a full
ex a watch made a fake Rolex,

3539
01:27:00,591 --> 01:27:03,680
there's gotta be a Rolex and
you've been around the fake stuff,

3540
01:27:03,681 --> 01:27:04,820
you've been around the full Lexis,

3541
01:27:04,821 --> 01:27:06,560
you felt the weight of
them and they broke on you.

3542
01:27:06,870 --> 01:27:07,150
You,

3543
01:27:07,150 --> 01:27:07,970
you've seen it and you,

3544
01:27:07,970 --> 01:27:10,720
you sometimes gotta get close
enough to where it ticks,

3545
01:27:10,740 --> 01:27:12,320
where it has a smooth transition.

3546
01:27:12,950 --> 01:27:16,100
Other Times you got to actually hold it
because there's that smooth transition

3547
01:27:16,101 --> 01:27:17,510
on the Rolex instead of ticking.

3548
01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:18,750
Other ones are so tricky.

3549
01:27:18,751 --> 01:27:19,760
You actually got to feel the weight.

3550
01:27:19,790 --> 01:27:19,930
What,

3551
01:27:19,930 --> 01:27:22,610
what you're making an analogy
too is the fake religious people,

3552
01:27:22,611 --> 01:27:24,230
the people that know the people that,

3553
01:27:24,231 --> 01:27:24,520
that,

3554
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:24,820
that,

3555
01:27:24,820 --> 01:27:25,880
that abused me.

3556
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,030
And there's a lot of religious people
that abused people that judge people that

3557
01:27:29,031 --> 01:27:29,721
all this stuff,

3558
01:27:29,721 --> 01:27:30,051
man.

3559
01:27:30,051 --> 01:27:30,590
And,

3560
01:27:30,590 --> 01:27:31,281
and for me,

3561
01:27:31,281 --> 01:27:35,210
and what this guy shared with me and
what he did was he didn't look at the

3562
01:27:35,211 --> 01:27:37,880
problems I was going through
except for to help me out of him.

3563
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:40,400
He didn't come down on
me about any of them.

3564
01:27:40,670 --> 01:27:41,720
He didn't judge me.

3565
01:27:41,900 --> 01:27:43,010
He didn't say you're wrong.

3566
01:27:43,220 --> 01:27:45,620
He didn't say God hates you.

3567
01:27:45,890 --> 01:27:46,430
He didn't.

3568
01:27:46,430 --> 01:27:46,911
He said,

3569
01:27:46,911 --> 01:27:47,750
God loves you bro.

3570
01:27:47,950 --> 01:27:49,550
And you got problems and that's okay.

3571
01:27:49,910 --> 01:27:50,810
And Love God,

3572
01:27:50,811 --> 01:27:51,350
love people.

3573
01:27:51,350 --> 01:27:52,490
If you can do that thing,

3574
01:27:52,890 --> 01:27:54,350
it would solve all the problems.

3575
01:27:54,351 --> 01:27:59,240
If you could love God and love people
that and then that would change things.

3576
01:27:59,241 --> 01:28:01,250
And so that's what changed
my life was like wow.

3577
01:28:01,700 --> 01:28:06,050
And the Wa what had to happen first was
to see if God could actually love me.

3578
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:09,540
And then I felt it me and my own
personal experience and encounter.

3579
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:10,311
Like I felt like,

3580
01:28:10,311 --> 01:28:10,700
man,

3581
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:11,533
God,

3582
01:28:11,540 --> 01:28:12,470
God doesn't hate me.

3583
01:28:12,740 --> 01:28:13,640
He might love me.

3584
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:17,630
And then I feel like he does love me and
then he wants me to love him back and

3585
01:28:17,631 --> 01:28:18,290
love people.

3586
01:28:18,290 --> 01:28:20,690
And if I can do those two things for me,

3587
01:28:21,230 --> 01:28:22,400
that would change.

3588
01:28:22,610 --> 01:28:27,140
It has changed my life and I believe
it will change others lives if I can do

3589
01:28:27,141 --> 01:28:27,680
that.

3590
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:29,690
I think for a lot of
people who are atheists,

3591
01:28:29,990 --> 01:28:31,160
they hear this kind of talk,

3592
01:28:31,161 --> 01:28:31,511
one of them,

3593
01:28:31,511 --> 01:28:33,620
one of the things that comes to
mind is they're going to like,

3594
01:28:33,621 --> 01:28:34,670
where's is God?

3595
01:28:34,671 --> 01:28:35,421
You're talking about?

3596
01:28:35,421 --> 01:28:36,680
Where's this evidence?

3597
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:37,593
Um,

3598
01:28:37,610 --> 01:28:38,030
to,

3599
01:28:38,030 --> 01:28:38,830
to put it into it,

3600
01:28:38,830 --> 01:28:40,100
the way I kind of look at it,

3601
01:28:40,101 --> 01:28:42,010
like a lot of people,

3602
01:28:42,011 --> 01:28:42,260
uh,

3603
01:28:42,260 --> 01:28:44,630
have thought for whatever reason that,

3604
01:28:44,660 --> 01:28:45,320
uh,

3605
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:48,260
that I don't believe in God
or that I'm anti God or,

3606
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:49,820
or that I'm an atheist.

3607
01:28:50,270 --> 01:28:50,810
I'm,

3608
01:28:50,810 --> 01:28:51,643
I would,

3609
01:28:51,860 --> 01:28:54,440
I would not classify myself in any way,

3610
01:28:54,441 --> 01:28:55,274
shape or form.

3611
01:28:55,340 --> 01:28:55,550
Uh,

3612
01:28:55,550 --> 01:28:58,850
I definitely don't think that
I am an atheist because I,

3613
01:28:58,851 --> 01:29:00,710
I don't not believe in God.

3614
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:02,130
But what I think

3615
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:07,130
is that when someone can tune into the
genuine intentions of the best aspects of

3616
01:29:11,851 --> 01:29:12,780
any religion,

3617
01:29:12,781 --> 01:29:14,220
whether it's Christianity,

3618
01:29:14,370 --> 01:29:15,550
whether it's Hinduism,

3619
01:29:15,570 --> 01:29:20,570
whether it's what it really boils
down to is love and generosity and,

3620
01:29:21,770 --> 01:29:22,111
and,

3621
01:29:22,111 --> 01:29:23,800
and fellowship and,

3622
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:29,000
and moving towards good and bringing
people together with happiness rather than

3623
01:29:29,101 --> 01:29:30,270
moving towards bad.

3624
01:29:30,390 --> 01:29:32,280
And what you've done in your life,

3625
01:29:32,281 --> 01:29:33,300
you can call it God,

3626
01:29:33,301 --> 01:29:34,290
you can call it anything,

3627
01:29:34,291 --> 01:29:39,291
but what you've done in your life is
recognize the worst possible aspects to

3628
01:29:40,381 --> 01:29:41,610
chemical addiction,

3629
01:29:41,611 --> 01:29:42,510
the depression,

3630
01:29:42,511 --> 01:29:43,380
the sadness,

3631
01:29:43,381 --> 01:29:44,214
the failure,

3632
01:29:44,370 --> 01:29:46,140
all the self sabotage.

3633
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:49,470
And then realize there's
another way to do this.

3634
01:29:49,770 --> 01:29:52,320
I've hit the worst possible frequency.

3635
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:56,580
And I've also kind of barely been able
to tune into this great frequency,

3636
01:29:56,581 --> 01:29:56,761
well,

3637
01:29:56,761 --> 01:29:57,630
what is this?

3638
01:29:58,170 --> 01:30:00,780
Knowing the lows and the lowest lows,

3639
01:30:00,930 --> 01:30:05,190
sometimes you can really sort
of extrapolate that there's a,

3640
01:30:05,191 --> 01:30:06,360
there's a counter to that.

3641
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:07,860
There's 180 degrees to that.

3642
01:30:07,861 --> 01:30:10,380
Just like your friend was talking
about the full lux and the Rolex,

3643
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:11,100
you know,

3644
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:11,690
you call,

3645
01:30:11,690 --> 01:30:11,940
you know,

3646
01:30:11,940 --> 01:30:14,130
for a lot of people that have
a problem with the word God.

3647
01:30:14,131 --> 01:30:14,580
You know,

3648
01:30:14,580 --> 01:30:18,030
I had this Guy Alex Grey on
who's this visionary artists,

3649
01:30:18,420 --> 01:30:19,920
really fascinating,

3650
01:30:19,921 --> 01:30:20,701
fascinating guy,

3651
01:30:20,701 --> 01:30:23,310
and he's also this a
psychedelic adventure.

3652
01:30:24,090 --> 01:30:26,700
And he throws around the word
God all the time and he's like,

3653
01:30:26,970 --> 01:30:27,211
you know,

3654
01:30:27,211 --> 01:30:31,650
we kind of have to take that word back
because the word God sort of has this bad

3655
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:32,570
heebie jeebies yeah,

3656
01:30:32,710 --> 01:30:33,250
yeah.

3657
01:30:33,250 --> 01:30:33,540
Like,

3658
01:30:33,540 --> 01:30:33,901
Oh,

3659
01:30:33,901 --> 01:30:35,280
you're talking about nonsense.

3660
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:36,151
But no,

3661
01:30:36,151 --> 01:30:38,870
you're not necessarily talking
about nonsense and you're,

3662
01:30:38,871 --> 01:30:39,091
you know,

3663
01:30:39,091 --> 01:30:40,470
just because you can't prove it.

3664
01:30:40,471 --> 01:30:42,000
And just because you know,

3665
01:30:42,030 --> 01:30:42,161
the,

3666
01:30:42,161 --> 01:30:44,040
the Bible was written
thousands of years ago,

3667
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:46,140
it doesn't mean it's all bullshit.

3668
01:30:46,170 --> 01:30:47,003
And the,

3669
01:30:47,010 --> 01:30:47,221
the,

3670
01:30:47,221 --> 01:30:49,530
the true frequency of love,

3671
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:51,800
the true frequency of
fellowship is really what,

3672
01:30:51,930 --> 01:30:53,220
what leads to happiness.

3673
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:55,260
If you're experiencing that yourself.

3674
01:30:55,290 --> 01:30:55,711
Oh Man,

3675
01:30:55,711 --> 01:30:56,041
I am.

3676
01:30:56,041 --> 01:30:56,920
And that's what this,

3677
01:30:56,921 --> 01:30:59,550
this vision is for me with
the pygmies in the Congo,

3678
01:31:00,210 --> 01:31:03,330
like a lot of people have misinterpreted
it to where they've thought,

3679
01:31:03,450 --> 01:31:03,601
oh,

3680
01:31:03,601 --> 01:31:05,520
you're just going there to
make a bunch of converts.

3681
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:08,250
You should take him a sandwich
instead of a bunch of converts.

3682
01:31:08,251 --> 01:31:09,030
Like if,

3683
01:31:09,030 --> 01:31:09,840
if people,

3684
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:10,131
if,

3685
01:31:10,131 --> 01:31:11,700
if you actually looked at what I'm doing,

3686
01:31:12,120 --> 01:31:14,670
like I'm actually doing slave liberation,

3687
01:31:14,671 --> 01:31:16,800
rainforest conservation
and wildlife preservation,

3688
01:31:16,830 --> 01:31:19,080
all wrapped into one
sustainable ways of life.

3689
01:31:19,081 --> 01:31:19,770
This and that.

3690
01:31:19,770 --> 01:31:22,170
It does not hinge around,

3691
01:31:22,890 --> 01:31:23,670
uh,

3692
01:31:23,670 --> 01:31:27,360
it does not really hinge around
if they become a Christian or not.

3693
01:31:27,361 --> 01:31:28,990
If they don't and they
don't want to and they will,

3694
01:31:29,020 --> 01:31:30,330
they want to worship their god,

3695
01:31:30,331 --> 01:31:30,900
do witchcraft,

3696
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:32,280
do all that fine.

3697
01:31:32,310 --> 01:31:36,780
I'm going to love you the same way I feel
like God has put on my heart a desire

3698
01:31:36,781 --> 01:31:41,781
to love them and to love them well and
to love them regardless of their choices

3699
01:31:41,881 --> 01:31:42,690
that they make.

3700
01:31:42,690 --> 01:31:46,620
Just because my choices are to love
them and it doesn't hinge around if,

3701
01:31:46,650 --> 01:31:48,840
if they do what I want them to do or not.

3702
01:31:48,870 --> 01:31:50,250
Like they're my family.

3703
01:31:50,610 --> 01:31:51,900
And so I want to see them be,

3704
01:31:51,930 --> 01:31:54,510
be self sustainable and
all that other stuff.

3705
01:31:54,511 --> 01:31:55,344
So it's not about,

3706
01:31:56,910 --> 01:32:00,010
it's not about like are they
going to converts or anything

3707
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:00,930
like that at all.

3708
01:32:00,940 --> 01:32:01,540
It's about,

3709
01:32:01,540 --> 01:32:05,230
I'm going to love you guys and see
you guys go from being slaves to being

3710
01:32:05,231 --> 01:32:05,741
liberated,

3711
01:32:05,741 --> 01:32:07,510
to being free to being
put on your own land,

3712
01:32:07,511 --> 01:32:08,830
to being able to farm,

3713
01:32:09,220 --> 01:32:09,611
uh,

3714
01:32:09,611 --> 01:32:11,260
to being able to produce
your own corn and beans.

3715
01:32:11,261 --> 01:32:13,270
Crops which are getting ready
for their second harvest,

3716
01:32:13,630 --> 01:32:14,411
first time in history.

3717
01:32:14,411 --> 01:32:15,580
They're gonna have their own school.

3718
01:32:15,610 --> 01:32:16,421
You're gonna be educated.

3719
01:32:16,421 --> 01:32:17,141
Once they're educated,

3720
01:32:17,141 --> 01:32:18,880
they can represent
themselves at the capitol.

3721
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:20,980
They can be citizens of
the country after that.

3722
01:32:21,370 --> 01:32:21,581
I mean,

3723
01:32:21,581 --> 01:32:22,000
it's just,

3724
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,270
it goes on and on and on
and it's like anybody,

3725
01:32:24,340 --> 01:32:27,220
I don't think anybody who's reasonable
who listens to you would think that

3726
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:30,190
you're just trying to convert people
because you're a religious zealot.

3727
01:32:30,191 --> 01:32:31,330
It doesn't sound like that at all.

3728
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:34,780
It sounds like you're doing everything
absolutely perfect with the best

3729
01:32:34,781 --> 01:32:35,800
intentions possible.

3730
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:36,401
And thank you.

3731
01:32:36,401 --> 01:32:37,390
It's beautiful story,

3732
01:32:37,391 --> 01:32:37,631
man.

3733
01:32:37,631 --> 01:32:38,201
It really is.

3734
01:32:38,201 --> 01:32:41,080
And it's one of the reasons why I wanted
to have you in here and talk to you

3735
01:32:41,081 --> 01:32:44,680
about it and it's become more
beautiful the more I hear about it,

3736
01:32:44,681 --> 01:32:44,921
man.

3737
01:32:44,921 --> 01:32:45,071
It's,

3738
01:32:45,071 --> 01:32:46,030
it's really cool.

3739
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:47,140
And uh,

3740
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:49,420
please come back again
when you're back in town,

3741
01:32:49,421 --> 01:32:51,160
when you're back a year from now.

3742
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:51,791
Yeah.

3743
01:32:51,791 --> 01:32:52,120
Again,

3744
01:32:52,120 --> 01:32:52,930
you got my number.

3745
01:32:52,930 --> 01:32:56,320
Get in touch with me and let's do
this again and tell me more things.

3746
01:32:56,350 --> 01:32:57,610
What's the end game?

3747
01:32:57,620 --> 01:32:58,720
Are you going to stay there forever?

3748
01:32:59,440 --> 01:32:59,680
Man,

3749
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:00,513
I honestly don't know.

3750
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:03,250
We're talking about that
with my future wife because,

3751
01:33:03,251 --> 01:33:03,460
uh,

3752
01:33:03,460 --> 01:33:04,150
she,

3753
01:33:04,150 --> 01:33:06,160
I don't think we could live there forever.

3754
01:33:06,890 --> 01:33:07,723
There's no,

3755
01:33:07,730 --> 01:33:08,563
there's no,

3756
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:12,610
but I do want to go back often in this
one years is my way of committing to

3757
01:33:12,611 --> 01:33:13,270
them.

3758
01:33:13,270 --> 01:33:14,260
And this is what's crazy man.

3759
01:33:14,261 --> 01:33:19,030
Like I'm trying to find a way to turn
this huge publicity or they're going

3760
01:33:19,031 --> 01:33:19,480
viral.

3761
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:23,140
It was on Jimmy Kimmel and TMC and the
today show and now there's going to be a

3762
01:33:23,141 --> 01:33:28,141
book and I'm trying to find a way to
go from 800,000 views to $50,000 or,

3763
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:33,280
or even maybe even 200 to 250
which I know that sounds like,

3764
01:33:33,290 --> 01:33:33,380
oh,

3765
01:33:33,380 --> 01:33:34,360
he started Kickstarter.

3766
01:33:34,550 --> 01:33:35,110
Yeah,

3767
01:33:35,110 --> 01:33:37,240
we're on Indiegogo right now.

3768
01:33:37,270 --> 01:33:38,350
And what does now that goes,

3769
01:33:38,351 --> 01:33:38,681
it's a,

3770
01:33:38,681 --> 01:33:39,940
it was before Kickstarter.

3771
01:33:39,970 --> 01:33:40,990
It's a crowdfunding site.

3772
01:33:41,380 --> 01:33:46,380
So it's indiegogo.com/projects/fight
hyphen for,

3773
01:33:47,831 --> 01:33:49,210
it's for the fight for the forgotten,

3774
01:33:49,211 --> 01:33:50,220
but hyphens in between it.

3775
01:33:50,980 --> 01:33:55,660
So indiegogo.com/projects/fight
for the forgotten,

3776
01:33:55,661 --> 01:33:59,920
but there's hyphens in between
fight hyphen for difficult
as fuck for someone to

3777
01:33:59,921 --> 01:34:00,820
give you some money.

3778
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:01,953
I know,

3779
01:34:02,140 --> 01:34:06,220
but where you can go to fight for the
forgotten.com and then you hit donate and

3780
01:34:06,221 --> 01:34:07,490
then it would take you the Indiegogo page,

3781
01:34:07,780 --> 01:34:10,020
fight for the forgotten.com go there,

3782
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:11,620
please go there.

3783
01:34:11,621 --> 01:34:12,221
And uh,

3784
01:34:12,221 --> 01:34:13,720
and and donate some cash.

3785
01:34:13,750 --> 01:34:14,583
That sounds,

3786
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:15,611
that sounds amazing,

3787
01:34:15,611 --> 01:34:15,910
man.

3788
01:34:15,910 --> 01:34:16,900
If we can help you,

3789
01:34:16,901 --> 01:34:18,550
if we can help publicize things,

3790
01:34:18,551 --> 01:34:19,930
we can tweak things for you,

3791
01:34:19,931 --> 01:34:23,020
just let me know you're going to have
any access to the Internet while you're

3792
01:34:23,021 --> 01:34:23,530
out there.

3793
01:34:23,530 --> 01:34:25,180
Actually my buddy that
I brought in with me,

3794
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:25,811
the film maker,

3795
01:34:25,811 --> 01:34:26,710
he's got a buddy that,

3796
01:34:26,711 --> 01:34:27,020
uh,

3797
01:34:27,020 --> 01:34:30,820
is developing this military technology
that's been picked up by him,

3798
01:34:30,821 --> 01:34:31,960
but uh,

3799
01:34:32,620 --> 01:34:36,130
they can fly like drones and stuff like
that from a briefcase and you'd take

3800
01:34:36,131 --> 01:34:37,580
this briefcase and uh,

3801
01:34:37,610 --> 01:34:41,650
you can take it to remote places of the
world and you set up these four squares

3802
01:34:41,651 --> 01:34:42,550
or something like that.

3803
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:45,010
And inside of that you have perfect Wifi,

3804
01:34:45,250 --> 01:34:46,330
high speed stuff.

3805
01:34:46,570 --> 01:34:47,403
So they're trying,

3806
01:34:47,530 --> 01:34:50,200
they're trying to see if they could get
that to me cause I've had zero contact

3807
01:34:50,201 --> 01:34:50,950
while I've been there.

3808
01:34:50,950 --> 01:34:52,510
So I'd love to be able
to Skype with people,

3809
01:34:52,540 --> 01:34:54,700
talk to people from the
jungle of the Congo.

3810
01:34:54,730 --> 01:34:57,070
All I needed was some power
that would definitely help.

3811
01:34:57,080 --> 01:34:58,400
And when you do do that,

3812
01:34:58,401 --> 01:35:00,420
please let us know and we'll
tweet it and we'll get,

3813
01:35:00,430 --> 01:35:02,210
we'll get it out there to
as many people as we can.

3814
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:02,351
Yeah,

3815
01:35:02,351 --> 01:35:02,900
that's great.

3816
01:35:02,900 --> 01:35:07,040
They'll hold the whole main
goal is getting potentially,

3817
01:35:07,041 --> 01:35:07,211
oh,

3818
01:35:07,211 --> 01:35:07,581
well that's,

3819
01:35:07,581 --> 01:35:11,300
that's actually what I would love to do
is if we could get Shalom university and

3820
01:35:11,301 --> 01:35:11,500
it's,

3821
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:13,220
it's the shares that the Indiegogo page,

3822
01:35:13,250 --> 01:35:16,280
if we could get them a
research center on the land,

3823
01:35:16,370 --> 01:35:16,820
uh,

3824
01:35:16,820 --> 01:35:18,740
and I'm talking about 1200 acres of land,

3825
01:35:18,741 --> 01:35:21,050
if we could get them a research center,

3826
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:25,070
then that would mean they have year round
students on the pygmy land and they'd

3827
01:35:25,071 --> 01:35:28,040
be able to develop them in different
self sustainable ways of life,

3828
01:35:28,041 --> 01:35:28,491
crops,

3829
01:35:28,491 --> 01:35:29,720
waterwheels all this stuff.

3830
01:35:30,110 --> 01:35:31,010
College students,

3831
01:35:31,011 --> 01:35:33,350
we get credit to uh,

3832
01:35:33,351 --> 01:35:35,540
develop the pygmies and
sustainable ways of life.

3833
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:36,051
And uh,

3834
01:35:36,051 --> 01:35:36,490
so the,

3835
01:35:36,490 --> 01:35:39,560
the big goal would be 200 to 250,000.

3836
01:35:39,561 --> 01:35:40,311
I think it's right there.

3837
01:35:40,311 --> 01:35:41,630
And it says what it does and it's,

3838
01:35:41,990 --> 01:35:44,120
it's some crazy stuff where,

3839
01:35:44,121 --> 01:35:44,954
uh,

3840
01:35:45,020 --> 01:35:45,500
where,

3841
01:35:45,500 --> 01:35:46,280
I mean,

3842
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:46,811
I'll,

3843
01:35:46,811 --> 01:35:48,440
I'll read it real quick and uh,

3844
01:35:48,470 --> 01:35:49,280
but it's,

3845
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:49,700
yeah,

3846
01:35:49,700 --> 01:35:51,840
so for 200 to 250,000,

3847
01:35:51,841 --> 01:35:53,120
and this is with the university,

3848
01:35:53,121 --> 01:35:54,080
this isn't something that made up,

3849
01:35:54,110 --> 01:35:56,180
this is what they've been able to say.

3850
01:35:56,330 --> 01:35:56,680
It would,

3851
01:35:56,680 --> 01:36:01,680
it would literally have three to 5,000
slaves put on five square kilometers of

3852
01:36:02,811 --> 01:36:03,740
perfect rain forests,

3853
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:05,830
five square kilometers of land for under,

3854
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:07,760
for the $200,000 price.

3855
01:36:07,761 --> 01:36:09,830
But then after that it would uh,

3856
01:36:09,890 --> 01:36:11,660
preserve the culture of the pygmies.

3857
01:36:11,690 --> 01:36:13,130
It would get water wells,

3858
01:36:13,131 --> 01:36:14,750
it would get nutritious crops growing.

3859
01:36:14,751 --> 01:36:15,411
So not just,

3860
01:36:15,411 --> 01:36:16,190
uh,

3861
01:36:16,190 --> 01:36:17,120
not just corn and beans,

3862
01:36:17,121 --> 01:36:17,800
but like,

3863
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:18,830
like good crops.

3864
01:36:19,070 --> 01:36:23,090
It would have a tilapia upon that stocked
so the corn would feed the chickens.

3865
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:27,170
It would also feed the Tilapia and it
would feed the pygmies and it just is a

3866
01:36:27,171 --> 01:36:28,550
self sustainable way of life.

3867
01:36:28,580 --> 01:36:31,700
It could have like a earth
bag home technology where,

3868
01:36:31,701 --> 01:36:32,481
have you ever seen those?

3869
01:36:32,481 --> 01:36:34,550
The earth back homes or the ECO domes?

3870
01:36:34,551 --> 01:36:36,680
Those things are going crazy today.

3871
01:36:36,681 --> 01:36:39,710
One of my buddies was over there having
a meeting with them and they might want

3872
01:36:39,711 --> 01:36:43,700
to support this project were four
in the u s three to five men.

3873
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:47,780
It would only take them three to five
days to build a three to five room home.

3874
01:36:48,290 --> 01:36:52,340
And it's under $300 in the
u s all it is is sandbags,

3875
01:36:52,370 --> 01:36:53,091
sandbags.

3876
01:36:53,091 --> 01:36:56,630
You fill it with dirt and he make this
like Adobe that you put on the outside of

3877
01:36:56,631 --> 01:36:57,100
it.

3878
01:36:57,100 --> 01:36:58,940
And so we're trying to get
that technology over there too.

3879
01:36:58,941 --> 01:37:02,240
I'm Shalom University is like
all on board wanting to do that.

3880
01:37:02,540 --> 01:37:03,111
And so really,

3881
01:37:03,111 --> 01:37:03,980
and then it would have that,

3882
01:37:03,981 --> 01:37:04,814
uh,

3883
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,970
could have that university research
center there where they get,

3884
01:37:08,330 --> 01:37:08,930
and that's the thing,

3885
01:37:08,930 --> 01:37:09,860
I don't want this,

3886
01:37:09,861 --> 01:37:10,491
this project,

3887
01:37:10,491 --> 01:37:14,210
I don't want the pygmies
to be dependent on me.

3888
01:37:14,330 --> 01:37:17,360
Like if I'm only there a year and I
can only do a year's worth of stuff,

3889
01:37:17,361 --> 01:37:21,710
I want this thing to be a well oiled
machine that it lasts long after I'm gone.

3890
01:37:22,250 --> 01:37:22,440
Um,

3891
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:23,630
so that way I don't know.

3892
01:37:23,631 --> 01:37:24,770
I want this thing to outlive me,

3893
01:37:24,771 --> 01:37:25,550
if that makes sense.

3894
01:37:25,550 --> 01:37:26,510
I wanted to keep going on.

3895
01:37:26,570 --> 01:37:27,410
It does make sense.

3896
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:29,030
It's a very noble idea,

3897
01:37:29,031 --> 01:37:29,390
man.

3898
01:37:29,390 --> 01:37:29,830
And it,

3899
01:37:29,830 --> 01:37:30,300
listen,

3900
01:37:30,300 --> 01:37:32,870
you've done an amazing
thing so far and uh,

3901
01:37:32,900 --> 01:37:33,830
we're going to try to help you.

3902
01:37:33,970 --> 01:37:36,080
So fight for the forgotten.com.

3903
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:37,990
Go there and give some money to the,

3904
01:37:38,120 --> 01:37:39,380
what does it Indego,

3905
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:43,400
what does indeed Gogo Dunkin
on indiegogo.com find it folks.

3906
01:37:43,401 --> 01:37:47,270

forgot for the forgotten dicot man,

3939
01:38:59,741 --> 01:39:04,200
just recovered from gut out of San Diego
and take shots of Jack Daniels with

3940
01:39:04,201 --> 01:39:07,320
Mexican narcotics because
they're right across the border.

3941
01:39:07,321 --> 01:39:08,100
And Sandy,

3942
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:09,450
I'm not telling you you should do this,

3943
01:39:09,990 --> 01:39:11,310
but if you're gonna do that,

3944
01:39:11,311 --> 01:39:12,300
that's the place to be.

3945
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:15,450

All right,

3950
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:20,900
my friends,

today.

3956
01:39:27,871 --> 01:39:28,704
You are,
