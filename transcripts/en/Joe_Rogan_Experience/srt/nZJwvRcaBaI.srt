1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:03,130
Doo doo,
Doo Doo Doo.

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,850
Oh,
what's up hunter?

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:06,900
How are you doing?
Gel.

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,820
I'm doing good now that we're actually 
live.

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:09,753
She feels more formal.
We're just talking about how crazy some 

6
00:00:12,061 --> 00:00:12,894
of the,
uh,

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,500
people in Brian Collins passed.
Then what is the like doing his show?

8
00:00:16,501 --> 00:00:17,340
Man,
I knew you guys.

9
00:00:17,341 --> 00:00:19,110
You're like cohos.
You keep them on the level.

10
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:19,831
Well,
yeah,

11
00:00:19,831 --> 00:00:20,451
so I mean,
what,

12
00:00:20,451 --> 00:00:22,470
what happened was,
is that a couple of years ago,

13
00:00:22,471 --> 00:00:26,520
Brian and I were talking about books and
Brian had just started doing his podcast

14
00:00:26,521 --> 00:00:28,680
at that point and uh,
you know,

15
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:29,514
he was sort of interviewing strippers,
a lot of strippers or like porn stars 

16
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:33,180
are like,
you know,

17
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,880
mma guys and that was fine,
but you know,

18
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:36,840
I was like,
Brian,

19
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:37,674
if you enjoy these books so much,
why don't we get on some of these 

20
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,760
professors?
And he was like,

21
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:42,743
really?
Like professors would talk to me and I 

22
00:00:44,101 --> 00:00:45,000
said,
well,

23
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:45,863
you know,
what are your download numbers and you 

24
00:00:46,831 --> 00:00:47,664
know,
he told me them and then I went off and 

25
00:00:48,991 --> 00:00:53,880
I liked the professors and like doubled 
or tripled them to do it though.

26
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:54,991
And then,
you know,

27
00:00:54,991 --> 00:00:55,824
as a result they were all like,
that's great because if you're a New 

28
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,733
York Times best selling author,
you usually have an audience of three 

29
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,310
and so have a chance to like actually 
reach a decent number of people,

30
00:01:05,311 --> 00:01:06,144
then yeah,
you're going to come on this weird 

31
00:01:06,781 --> 00:01:07,740
podcast.
You're like,

32
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,960
I've heard of podcasting,
what is that?

33
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:10,860
Why not?
Right.

34
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:11,993
And so we started getting all of these 
professors and academics and scientists 

35
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:19,140
and all that stuff on and um,
you know,

36
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,350
that's sort of been the journey and 
we're now 200 plus episodes in.

37
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,320
Yeah,
that's Brian loves that kind of stuff.

38
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,183
But I wish that like,
how come you never talked about that on 

39
00:01:27,211 --> 00:01:28,710
stage?
He just,

40
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:34,080
he wants to be captain silly face Joe.
Are we willing to wander into the dark,

41
00:01:35,551 --> 00:01:39,300
dark place?
That is Brian Collins mind dark place.

42
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,670
Yeah.
Are you ready to go there?

43
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:42,683
Yeah,
I've been there.

44
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:44,911
So,
I mean,

45
00:01:44,911 --> 00:01:47,730
a lot of it comes down to Brian's own 
personal insecurities.

46
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:48,564
Like he loves it,
but he doesn't feel confident engaging 

47
00:01:50,821 --> 00:01:52,650
with and breakout.
Disagree with that.

48
00:01:52,651 --> 00:01:56,280
I would say that he's just his comedy,
he prefers it to be silly,

49
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,513
you know,
because there's a difference between 

50
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,813
comedy and in Brian's mind,
especially between what's really funny 

51
00:02:03,211 --> 00:02:04,920
and what's really deep,
you know,

52
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,780
and he doesn't find deep things to be 
very funny.

53
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:07,614
He's not,
he doesn't,

54
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,440
you know what I mean?
Like he's,

55
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,423
when he gets into deep subjects,
he kind of gets into them just for what 

56
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:18,330
they are and not like tries to translate
those into comedy.

57
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,160
Does that make sense?
It does make sense.

58
00:02:20,161 --> 00:02:20,994
I mean,
but part of what I've seen across the 

59
00:02:22,051 --> 00:02:26,340
course of these 200 episodes is I think 
that Brian Kellen is growing up.

60
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,710
Oh Way.

61
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:32,670
Finally it like whatever age he is there
at 5:55

62
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,900
tomorrow.
Yeah.

63
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,793
There's starting to be an evolution and 
part of it is just sort of having 

64
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,740
actually talked to some of the smartest 
people in the world.

65
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:41,671
He's like,
oh,

66
00:02:41,671 --> 00:02:42,504
these are just people and you know,
they know certain ideas that I didn't 

67
00:02:45,391 --> 00:02:48,240
know and now I know them and you know,
maybe I can.

68
00:02:48,241 --> 00:02:52,050
And he even started experimenting with 
you particularly got really excited.

69
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,063
We had a guy called Joe Henrich on who 
wrote this great book called the secret 

70
00:02:55,861 --> 00:02:57,150
of our success,
um,

71
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,340
which is all about cultural evolution,
cultural evolution works,

72
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,890
and one of the things he talks about in 
there is,

73
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,420
you know,
why do we have black people in,

74
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:06,230
why do we have white people?
Um,

75
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,731
and,
you know,

76
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:10,030
it comes down to vitamin D and foliate 
and all these sorts of things.

77
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,650
Determine where are you from?
Oh,

78
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:15,940
I spent a lot of time in England and I 
got rid of most of my accent,

79
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:19,430
but there are weird words that come out 
like vitamin and being.

80
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,413
Um,
and so sometimes people think I'm 

81
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:22,234
Canadian,
which is hilarious because they 

82
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:29,920
literally can't place it.
Side story,

83
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,030
uh,
when I was,

84
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:32,320
when I first went to college,
you know,

85
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,183
I wanted to major in linguistics for 
awhile and I met with my linguistics 

86
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:39,100
professor and he sits me down and we're 
having a conversation just like this.

87
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,680
And then all of a sudden he stops me 
just like you did.

88
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:43,780
And he says,
wait a minute.

89
00:03:43,781 --> 00:03:47,380
And he proceeds to like ask me these 
really fucking bizarre questions.

90
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:48,214
Like he's like,
if John and Jane are in a race and John 

91
00:03:50,591 --> 00:03:52,900
comes fifth and Jane comes in 
afterwards,

92
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,400
what position does Jane come in?

93
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:59,580
And I was like sick and he goes,
British precedes to like do all of these

94
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,360
tests basically spot my accent.
Sixth,

95
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,120
sixth.
There's no ask.

96
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,200
It's not sixth.
Yeah,

97
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:11,320
it's super weird.
And then medicine is the other one.

98
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,120
They don't say medicine.
They say medicine.

99
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,950
Oh,
so by sick.

100
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,360
Wow,
that's interesting.

101
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,553
That's interesting because the Eq sound 
is really a k and then an ass even 

102
00:04:20,951 --> 00:04:21,784
though we represented as an ax.
So he basically had all these tests and 

103
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:25,834
he figured out pretty quickly that I was
trying to pass as an American and he's 

104
00:04:30,191 --> 00:04:31,030
like,
sorry,

105
00:04:31,031 --> 00:04:32,650
white boy,
not so much.

106
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,900
How long did you live in England for?
Ten years.

107
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,760
Ten years until your 10.
A from the age of eight until 18.

108
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,113
So if you were in England,
so you started out without an English 

109
00:04:42,641 --> 00:04:43,460
accent?
Yep.

110
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,293
Right.
So you learned English here and then 

111
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,533
when you started speaking in England,
did you sense that you were shifting 

112
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:52,240
over to nick and I sort of fought it.

113
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:55,020
I fought it and it's because what 
happens is,

114
00:04:55,021 --> 00:04:57,070
is that people naturally sort of start 
to,

115
00:04:57,071 --> 00:04:57,904
you know,
you're in a tribe and you start to like 

116
00:04:59,321 --> 00:05:02,350
pick up the values and the speech 
patterns and all that sort of stuff with

117
00:05:02,351 --> 00:05:04,030
the tribe.
And you know,

118
00:05:04,031 --> 00:05:06,490
I really thought of myself as American,
um,

119
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,730
in large part because I identified with 
my mom more than my dad.

120
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,710
Um,
and so what happened was,

121
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:12,281
is that,
you know,

122
00:05:12,281 --> 00:05:13,510
I was like,
Oh,

123
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,583
British accent creeping in.
And so I fought that with everything 

124
00:05:16,991 --> 00:05:17,824
that I could,
but in spite of fighting the accident 

125
00:05:19,481 --> 00:05:20,314
with everything,
I could these words that like being in 

126
00:05:22,391 --> 00:05:25,480
vitamin and medicine and sick that I 
wasn't watching for,

127
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:30,610
that no ordinary person would watch for,
crept into my mind is always interesting

128
00:05:30,611 --> 00:05:31,444
to me.
There's an added a insight that you get 

129
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:37,990
from people that come from another 
country and then live in America.

130
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,690
There's something different about like,
oh,

131
00:05:40,691 --> 00:05:43,000
you guys don't know how weird this 
fucking place.

132
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:44,920
Like I know,
you know,

133
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,480
I've been to Scotland,
I lived there.

134
00:05:46,481 --> 00:05:47,314
You know,
like those people have a different 

135
00:05:48,701 --> 00:05:49,534
insight.
Very different insight and also I think 

136
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:57,150
we're so established in America in so 
far as thinking that this

137
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,440
is how people live in the world.
Like this is where you go,

138
00:06:00,441 --> 00:06:02,260
you go to Byrd Gang,
it's right over there.

139
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,770
You get on the highway,
it's right over here.

140
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,783
And we see our landscape and we see our 
cityscapes and we see it as being 

141
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,080
normal.
If you don't go to another country,

142
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:12,651
you don't go,
oh,

143
00:06:12,651 --> 00:06:15,110
this is normal to,
this is normal for them.

144
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,730
Oh,
this is normal for them.

145
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,840
Yup.
This is like,

146
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:21,410
you really need to be there.
Like I don't think that's.

147
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,500
I don't think that's absorbable from a 
DVD.

148
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,180
No,
and part of it is,

149
00:06:27,181 --> 00:06:28,014
I mean,
this is a large part of what we've been 

150
00:06:28,861 --> 00:06:30,840
doing and what Joe Henrich work is 
about,

151
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,280
is the fact that,
you know,

152
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,980
when you're in a tribe,
whatever that tribe is,

153
00:06:34,981 --> 00:06:39,300
whether that's America or Christianity 
or mormonism or Islam or,

154
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,510
you know,
some Papa New Guinea,

155
00:06:40,511 --> 00:06:42,260
Ian's in the foothills of,
you know,

156
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,223
Papa,
New Guinea,

157
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,480
whatever you do,
you're like,

158
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,910
that's our way.
That's just the way things are done.

159
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,310
You don't question it,
right.

160
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,530
The tribe creates the sense that this is
what normalcy is.

161
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,900
And then the second you go outside the 
tribe,

162
00:06:54,901 --> 00:06:57,390
whatever that tribe is,
you're suddenly like,

163
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,910
oh,
our tribe is fucking weird.

164
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,030
There are other ways of doing things.
And um,

165
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,953
that,
that's sort of been a large part of the 

166
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:06,324
experience that Brian and I had growing 
up because Brian's dad was my dad's 

167
00:07:09,121 --> 00:07:09,954
boss.

168
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,810
Uh,
so

169
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,043
I'm the first place that I went after I 
was born in Saudi Arabia was Brian's 

170
00:07:16,091 --> 00:07:17,770
house.
Like at work.

171
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,200
I went to Brian's house.
Um,

172
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,640
and so for the last,
you know,

173
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,860
and then we moved around and we moved to
different places.

174
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:24,700
He did,
you know,

175
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:25,950
Philippines,
you know,

176
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,531
whatever,
whatever,

177
00:07:26,531 --> 00:07:28,360
whatever.
I did Saudi Arabia,

178
00:07:28,361 --> 00:07:29,260
Greece,
Brazil,

179
00:07:29,261 --> 00:07:30,470
England,
um,

180
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:34,330
and then my parents moved to France and 
Libya and the UAE and then,

181
00:07:34,331 --> 00:07:35,500
you know,
I came to the US.

182
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,680
So,
so moving constantly between tribes,

183
00:07:38,681 --> 00:07:41,320
like that was a large part of my 
experience growing up as a kid was I was

184
00:07:41,321 --> 00:07:42,154
constantly like,
people are all the same and yet they're 

185
00:07:45,311 --> 00:07:48,280
fucking different.
And how does that work?

186
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,443
Um,
and because I come from the background 

187
00:07:51,191 --> 00:07:53,910
of science,
my first response was like,

188
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,990
oh,
well there must be science of this,

189
00:07:55,991 --> 00:07:56,824
right?
Why not go and look at that science and 

190
00:07:57,851 --> 00:07:58,684
see what the science says about that?
Turns out there's a massive amount of 

191
00:08:01,361 --> 00:08:02,230
science all about it.

192
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:03,883
Yeah.
There's a massive amount of science all 

193
00:08:04,671 --> 00:08:05,504
about it.
And it's so fascinating when you stop 

194
00:08:07,011 --> 00:08:07,844
and think that there are some people on.
I'm sure you've seen the most recent 

195
00:08:10,641 --> 00:08:15,260
photos of that uncontacted tribe now 
contacted obviously in the Amazon,

196
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,910
like really recently over the last 
couple of weeks.

197
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,020
Oh,
it's amazing.

198
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,950
Yeah.
Really cool.

199
00:08:18,951 --> 00:08:20,150
I mean,
these people were there.

200
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,043
They don't have American teacher,
like sometimes you'll see like these 

201
00:08:23,301 --> 00:08:24,134
tribes and they're deep in the Amazon,
but they have to tee shirts on and like 

202
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,800
can't get there.
There's,

203
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:33,050
there's some sort of interaction with 
these people.

204
00:08:33,051 --> 00:08:33,884
There's none,
there's been no interaction with the 

205
00:08:34,851 --> 00:08:35,684
West.
They have stick bows they've made and 

206
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:38,834
you know,
they're all barefoot and all wearing 

207
00:08:39,681 --> 00:08:41,270
leaves and shit.
You know,

208
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:43,040
these people,
they're here.

209
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:47,270
They aren't trucking along in 2017 and 
you've got to think 50,

210
00:08:47,271 --> 00:08:48,440
60,000
years ago.

211
00:08:48,441 --> 00:08:50,870
They probably were living exactly the 
same way.

212
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,340
Yep.
Yup.

213
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,173
And what's fascinating is just the 
degree to which those people have so 

214
00:08:56,281 --> 00:08:59,550
much to teach us because you know,
a lot of what happened,

215
00:08:59,551 --> 00:09:00,384
you know,
in the beginning of the enlightenment 

216
00:09:01,021 --> 00:09:01,681
is,
as you know,

217
00:09:01,681 --> 00:09:04,290
if you look at Locke and Rousseau and 
all these guys,

218
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:05,970
they're trying to imagine the state of 
nature,

219
00:09:05,971 --> 00:09:07,980
but they're a group of people who are 
sitting around in Europe.

220
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,580
They've never met somebody from the 
Amazon or someone from Papa New Guinea.

221
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,070
And now we really have a pretty good 
idea of what,

222
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,970
what was life like before civilization?
Um,

223
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:18,963
and,
and it's,

224
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,430
I mean,
it's pretty damn fascinating.

225
00:09:20,431 --> 00:09:22,650
I mean jared diamond has this great 
book,

226
00:09:22,651 --> 00:09:24,470
the world until yesterday,
um,

227
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,990
which is literally all about life before
civilization.

228
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:32,310
And what are the things that we can 
learn as moderns from these people?

229
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:33,443
Um,
what are the things they get right that 

230
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:35,274
we get wrong?

231
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,200
Like what was his examples?
Well,

232
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,580
he has,
there's a bunch of interesting ones.

233
00:09:38,581 --> 00:09:41,280
One of my favorite ones is a 
constructive paranoia.

234
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:44,310
Um,
so what happens is when you have tribes,

235
00:09:44,311 --> 00:09:45,144
people and they go outside of their 
village and they suddenly become 

236
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:51,780
massively paranoid,
like incredibly paranoid and he's like,

237
00:09:51,781 --> 00:09:53,550
you know,
these people are more paranoid than your

238
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,020
average New York Jew,
right?

239
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,063
Like suddenly,
like wandering around the forest and 

240
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:59,124
they're like,
shit,

241
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,710
is this tree gonna fall down?
Where can we sleep?

242
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,320
Like they go and they check the trees,
they look for footprints.

243
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,213
Oh my God.
Are those the footprints of some other 

244
00:10:06,451 --> 00:10:07,141
tribe?
Like,

245
00:10:07,141 --> 00:10:08,670
what's going on?
What does that sound?

246
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,800
And he's like,
what is this paranoia about?

247
00:10:10,801 --> 00:10:14,520
And for a long time he thought this 
paranoid paranoia was just misplaced,

248
00:10:14,521 --> 00:10:17,880
that it was inappropriate.
But then he had this experience where he

249
00:10:17,881 --> 00:10:21,060
had a couple of experiences,
one of which was around,

250
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,200
you know,
somebody,

251
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,500
some other tribe that was potentially 
trying to kill him in Papa New Guinea.

252
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:29,640
And then the other one was around.
He basically was getting on this boat.

253
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:30,683
And you know,
if you're in the west and you get on a 

254
00:10:31,771 --> 00:10:33,870
boat at the New York Port Authority or 
whatever,

255
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,370
you feel like,
oh yeah,

256
00:10:35,371 --> 00:10:37,590
this boat safe.
Like there are safety rules.

257
00:10:37,591 --> 00:10:39,180
Probably someone would check it,
whatever.

258
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:40,014
So he gets on this boat,
the boat goes out into the ocean and 

259
00:10:42,331 --> 00:10:45,270
like capsizes and sinks and he almost 
drowned to death.

260
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:48,390
And it's basically because these kids 
who were running the boat,

261
00:10:48,391 --> 00:10:49,224
we're running it way too fast and the 
water kept sloshing over the side and 

262
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:53,334
the highways and a certain point.
There's so much water in the boat that 

263
00:10:55,181 --> 00:10:57,890
the boat goes down.
You know,

264
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,740
when you're in that kind of environment,
one of these societies that doesn't have

265
00:11:01,741 --> 00:11:03,990
protections and doesn't have rules and 
all that sort of stuff.

266
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,063
Being paranoid as super smart,
it's the most appropriate thing you can 

267
00:11:07,561 --> 00:11:09,690
do,
and he then talks about how,

268
00:11:09,691 --> 00:11:10,980
you know,
he's in 70,

269
00:11:10,981 --> 00:11:11,940
80 year old man.

270
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,773
He's like,
I need to be more paranoid because the 

271
00:11:14,521 --> 00:11:15,354
reality is if I go down,
it's probably because I slipped in the 

272
00:11:17,461 --> 00:11:18,294
shower.
There are all these things that can 

273
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:21,714
actually kill me in my environment that 
I sort of take for granted because my 

274
00:11:24,961 --> 00:11:25,794
world seems so safe.
And so one of the things you learned 

275
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:33,870
from that is that paranoia is a tool and
rather than a lot of people have trouble

276
00:11:33,871 --> 00:11:36,180
with paranoia where they're 
indiscriminately paranoid,

277
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,313
but the key is figuring out what to be 
paranoid about when to be paranoid so 

278
00:11:40,501 --> 00:11:42,840
that you're hyper alert,
alert to threats.

279
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,760
I would totally make sense.
Yeah.

280
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,200
I mean they're very vulnerable.
They're so soft and flushing.

281
00:11:48,201 --> 00:11:49,034
Most of their body's exposed and there's
all sorts of different poisonous things 

282
00:11:52,681 --> 00:11:54,010
and things

283
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:58,840
and cats and fucking spiders and 
whatever the hell is out there.

284
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:01,320
And if you break a leg in the gun,
you're done.

285
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:02,243
Yeah.
And that's the point is they don't have 

286
00:12:03,331 --> 00:12:04,230
the luxury of,
Oh,

287
00:12:04,231 --> 00:12:05,041
I was,
you know,

288
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:08,010
not paying attention to in crossfit I 
dropped a barbell on my foot.

289
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,060
Oh,
I go to the doctor.

290
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,040
I'm out for a few months.
Not a big deal.

291
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,410
Yeah.
It's a shorter life though.

292
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,960
It doesn't seem like nearly as fun.
It will be.

293
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:20,340
The interesting thing is that in many 
ways that it's actually more fun because

294
00:12:20,341 --> 00:12:21,970
they have such a strong,
like,

295
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,630
you know,
part of what we don't have.

296
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:25,523
And obviously part of what you're 
creating with your podcast and what 

297
00:12:27,361 --> 00:12:30,930
we're trying to create on a smaller 
level with our podcasts is tribe,

298
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,161
right?
Like we,

299
00:12:32,161 --> 00:12:34,140
you know,
a strong sense of community,

300
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,630
a group of people that you belong with,
you know,

301
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:39,180
you're in it together,
all of that sort of stuff.

302
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,040
And you know,
America.

303
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,080
And he particularly talks about the 
elderly,

304
00:12:43,081 --> 00:12:45,000
you know,
he talks about what is the experience of

305
00:12:45,001 --> 00:12:48,660
the elderly in a tribe and you know,
you're super valuable until death.

306
00:12:48,661 --> 00:12:49,494
Everybody respects the shit out of you.
You always have things to contribute to 

307
00:12:52,261 --> 00:12:54,840
a tribe.
What do we do with the elderly here?

308
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:58,170
You stick them in a fucking old person's
home and leave him to rot.

309
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,940
You know,
they don't have that sense of belonging,

310
00:12:59,941 --> 00:13:01,110
that sense of purpose late in life.

311
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,013
Do you think that's a sheer volume thing
that's almost like we don't value life 

312
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:05,884
as much because we're overwhelmed by it.
When we're talking about the last 

313
00:13:08,711 --> 00:13:12,670
podcast about the number of people in 
America today versus when I was a kid.

314
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,500
Yeah,
when I was 14 there was.

315
00:13:14,501 --> 00:13:17,650
We figured there was 230 200,
what was it?

316
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,740
Twenty five.
Two hundred and $25 million.

317
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,270
Now there's a 100 million plus more.
Just the sheer volume.

318
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,313
It seems like if we lived in a small 
town and there was some guy that we 

319
00:13:29,051 --> 00:13:31,750
really loved and he was starting to die,
we'd want to take care of them.

320
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:32,743
Right.
But if it's like crazy asshole that's 

321
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:35,470
down the hallway in your apartment 
building,

322
00:13:35,471 --> 00:13:36,304
you never even talked to that dude 
because there's a thousand people in 

323
00:13:37,931 --> 00:13:40,030
your apartment building that you never 
talked to.

324
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,020
Right?
Well,

325
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,260
part part of it is like what are 
neurological limits?

326
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,293
Right?
So in general there's what's called the 

327
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,780
Dunbar number and the Dunbar number,
you know,

328
00:13:49,781 --> 00:13:51,520
it's like one of the 50,
1:50

329
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:54,460
and then there are serious to explain 
that what that is for people who haven't

330
00:13:54,461 --> 00:13:56,170
heard of that,
it's pretty simple.

331
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,780
The easiest way to understand it is 
facebook,

332
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:00,370
right?
Like you may have 4,000

333
00:14:00,371 --> 00:14:01,204
friends on facebook,
but then you constantly find like who 

334
00:14:03,161 --> 00:14:06,700
the fuck are these people that I 
friended?

335
00:14:06,701 --> 00:14:08,650
And some sort of like friending for 
instance,

336
00:14:08,651 --> 00:14:09,510
like a song.
Yeah.

337
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,600
Well hopefully not.
I don't think that you were breaking up.

338
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,500
I don't think that's going to take off.
But you,

339
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,900
you find that like,
oh,

340
00:14:16,901 --> 00:14:18,910
I only really know a few of these 
people,

341
00:14:18,911 --> 00:14:21,190
the majority of them my brain can't 
track.

342
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,650
Right.
And you even get into that experience.

343
00:14:23,651 --> 00:14:24,484
Like that's what I always find 
fascinating is you run into someone you 

344
00:14:26,141 --> 00:14:26,974
haven't seen in a long time,
right on the street and you're kind of 

345
00:14:29,231 --> 00:14:31,080
avoiding the interaction.
This,

346
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:32,170
you're like,
oh,

347
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:33,850
where the fuck do I know this guy from?
Yeah.

348
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,070
And you also then if you like,
really get into it,

349
00:14:36,071 --> 00:14:38,290
then you have to dust off the 
relationship.

350
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:42,010
You have to invest time.
It's fucking exhausting.

351
00:14:42,011 --> 00:14:43,100
Right?
So there's,

352
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:47,530
there's a real limit to like how many 
people any one human brain can handle.

353
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,630
Isn't it more of like the top nine on my
space?

354
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,990
Remember,
wasn't

355
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,290
it nine?
Was it nine people?

356
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,150
Yeah.
When were you to have a top nine?

357
00:14:56,151 --> 00:14:56,984
And like those,
those are the people that you were like 

358
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,400
pretty tight with you to have your boys,
all your friends and the top nine.

359
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,490
Well there's a,
there's a series

360
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,840
Dunbar numbers,
right?

361
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,310
And there's like,
you know,

362
00:15:06,311 --> 00:15:08,590
there's essentially like two or three 
people who are like,

363
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,720
you would tell anything to.
Right.

364
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,760
And then there's sort of like your top 
nine,

365
00:15:12,761 --> 00:15:13,840
right?
You're sort of like,

366
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,760
oh we're cool,
we can all go hang out.

367
00:15:15,761 --> 00:15:18,350
If I was going to have a bachelor party,
these are the people I would invite.

368
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,540
Right.
And then,

369
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:20,374
you know,
you sort of get out into larger and 

370
00:15:21,191 --> 00:15:24,250
larger circles.
One 50 is sort of the size of a tribe,

371
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,710
but then you know,
even though there's 1:50,

372
00:15:26,711 --> 00:15:27,700
there's,
you know,

373
00:15:27,701 --> 00:15:28,780
whatever,
4,000

374
00:15:28,781 --> 00:15:29,591
people,
5,000

375
00:15:29,591 --> 00:15:32,080
people who like,
you'd recognize their face,

376
00:15:32,081 --> 00:15:34,330
but you're like,
I don't totally fucking know you.

377
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:39,730
So there's a series of all these things,
but whatever the numbers are,

378
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,230
it's not 7 billion.

379
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,720
Well that's what's interesting about 
small towns is that there's a,

380
00:15:47,721 --> 00:15:51,700
there's a feeling in small towns of an 
invasion,

381
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:55,990
invasion of your privacy as much as 
there is a feeling of comradery.

382
00:15:55,991 --> 00:16:00,991
There's also like a nosiness yeah.
So like if there's 2000 people living in

383
00:16:01,811 --> 00:16:04,060
an apartment building,
nobody wants to know shit about anybody.

384
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,380
Right?
Yeah.

385
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,720
But if it's 2000 people living in a 
town,

386
00:16:07,721 --> 00:16:11,050
that's the whole town and everybody 
needs to know everything about everybody

387
00:16:11,051 --> 00:16:11,720
else.
Yeah.

388
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,553
That.
But that hunter boy know what he's up 

389
00:16:13,721 --> 00:16:15,400
to.
And what about that Brian?

390
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,050
Oh,
he's a wacky one.

391
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:20,230
And everybody wants to gossip and 
exchange information.

392
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,480
What gossip is what Dunbar his work is 
really about.

393
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,870
Um,
so his big book is a grooming gossip and

394
00:16:27,871 --> 00:16:30,720
the origins of language.
And so Dunbar,

395
00:16:30,721 --> 00:16:33,060
his whole thesis is.
The big question has always been like,

396
00:16:33,061 --> 00:16:34,470
why do we talk,
right?

397
00:16:34,471 --> 00:16:37,500
Like why do humans have language,
what is the function of language?

398
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,693
And what Dunbar did was he basically 
looked at what's the natural group size 

399
00:16:41,671 --> 00:16:42,930
of different primates,
right?

400
00:16:42,931 --> 00:16:43,800
So,
you know,

401
00:16:43,801 --> 00:16:48,360
there's a natural group size for a apes 
for chimpanzees and you know,

402
00:16:48,361 --> 00:16:52,400
orangutans and all this sort of stuff.
And what ends up happening is,

403
00:16:52,401 --> 00:16:54,450
is that when you,
if you're chimps,

404
00:16:54,451 --> 00:16:54,961
right?
You know,

405
00:16:54,961 --> 00:16:57,050
you can groom all the members of your 
team,

406
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,350
of your troop,
right?

407
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,184
That's not a big problem.
But if your trip is 150 people like it 

408
00:17:01,861 --> 00:17:02,694
is for humans,
there's no way you can physically groom 

409
00:17:04,771 --> 00:17:08,910
all of those people so it becomes too 
many people to physically groom.

410
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:09,983
So essentially the idea is that language
is how we groom each other without 

411
00:17:13,411 --> 00:17:16,440
having to do it physically.
And that's what gossip is about.

412
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:19,110
It's really that we're like grooming 
each other,

413
00:17:19,111 --> 00:17:19,944
we're maintaining social relationships 
and we're trading information about 

414
00:17:23,611 --> 00:17:25,800
who's trustworthy,
who's not trustworthy,

415
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,813
who did what to who,
and passing information around in the 

416
00:17:29,401 --> 00:17:31,410
tribe.
Totally makes sense.

417
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:32,563
I mean,
it seems also when you think about how 

418
00:17:34,491 --> 00:17:37,070
women are really into gossiping and 
chatting,

419
00:17:37,071 --> 00:17:40,320
whereas men really appreciate quiet and,
and,

420
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:43,030
and then get upset if people are too 
flashy young.

421
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:45,530
It's about men going off into hunting 
parties.

422
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,590
Right?
And the women's staying back and going,

423
00:17:47,591 --> 00:17:48,424
you know,
this crazy motherfuckers doing when no 

424
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:49,944
one's looking and they have to try to 
assess what the dangers are in their 

425
00:17:52,051 --> 00:17:52,930
environments.
Yep.

426
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,323
And specifically men like what you're 
saying about like making sure that 

427
00:17:56,881 --> 00:17:59,610
nobody's getting too flashy.
That's,

428
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:00,031
I mean,
you know,

429
00:18:00,031 --> 00:18:01,830
that's the real function of teasing,
right?

430
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,450
The real function of teasing is this,
that,

431
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:04,643
you know,
if you look at these hunter gatherer 

432
00:18:05,491 --> 00:18:06,324
tribes,
they have all these mechanisms for 

433
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,660
making sure that nobody's head gets too 
big,

434
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,550
right?
So for example,

435
00:18:11,551 --> 00:18:12,930
you know,
they'll do things where,

436
00:18:12,931 --> 00:18:13,764
for example,
I'll give you my arrow and you'll go 

437
00:18:16,141 --> 00:18:19,920
hunt with my arrow.
So then even if you kill a deer,

438
00:18:19,921 --> 00:18:23,070
it's actually not your kill because it 
was done with my arrow.

439
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,990
It's everybody's,
it's everybody's killed.

440
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,340
So,
and then also,

441
00:18:26,341 --> 00:18:27,330
you know,
when they,

442
00:18:27,331 --> 00:18:28,164
for example,
they'll have all these rituals when 

443
00:18:29,071 --> 00:18:29,904
somebody is elected,
the big man of the tribe or whatever it 

444
00:18:31,651 --> 00:18:33,090
is,
they will.

445
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:35,640
Then all the group will get around and 
make fun of him,

446
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,623
right?
And they'll sort of humiliate him and 

447
00:18:37,561 --> 00:18:38,394
it's a sort of democracy.
It's a way of keeping him his ego in 

448
00:18:42,481 --> 00:18:42,870
check.

449
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,760
So this is what Donald Trump is 
avoiding.

450
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:49,790
The exact this is,
he's avoiding this inevitable reality of

451
00:18:50,131 --> 00:18:52,560
being mocked me.
So mad at Alec Baldwin.

452
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,370
Well then he should,
he should embrace it.

453
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,390
I mean,
that's the shit,

454
00:18:55,391 --> 00:18:56,230
right?
He should,

455
00:18:56,231 --> 00:18:57,130
because I mean,
it's,

456
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,500
that's if for his social function,
right,

457
00:18:59,501 --> 00:19:03,700
the leaders social function is to be 
humble because we,

458
00:19:03,701 --> 00:19:05,080
you know,
power corrupts,

459
00:19:05,081 --> 00:19:06,820
like that's what it does to human 
psychology.

460
00:19:06,821 --> 00:19:07,654
That's not a function of Donald trump.
That's just a function of the human 

461
00:19:09,101 --> 00:19:09,934
brain.
Right?

462
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,051
Um,
and,

463
00:19:11,051 --> 00:19:11,900
you know,
we,

464
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:12,980
we know that.
I mean,

465
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,751
that's,
you know,

466
00:19:13,751 --> 00:19:14,584
that's been studied.
Now there's a guy at a bar at a UC 

467
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,401
Berkeley,
dacher Keltner,

468
00:19:18,401 --> 00:19:20,380
who's also awesome,
um,

469
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:23,530
who's studied power and specifically,
you know,

470
00:19:23,531 --> 00:19:26,050
there's this old quote from Lord Acton,
power corrupts,

471
00:19:26,051 --> 00:19:27,790
absolute power corrupts.
Absolutely.

472
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,773
He went and studied that and he got more
specific and he found out that power 

473
00:19:31,301 --> 00:19:32,134
does two things.
It makes people more impulsive and it 

474
00:19:34,121 --> 00:19:37,030
makes them less empathetic.
So it makes people good,

475
00:19:37,031 --> 00:19:37,864
impulsive and bad.
Impulsive in the sense that you'll have 

476
00:19:39,851 --> 00:19:43,330
celebrities who will be like,
I'm giving away all my fucking money.

477
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,270
Right?
You're like,

478
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,740
oh,
that was fucking dumb.

479
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:50,350
Or like Wesley Snipes had that great 
idea of like,

480
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:53,490
I'm just going to not pay taxes.
In his defense,

481
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,413
he just got one of those wacky attorney 
convinced there's some loophole in the 

482
00:19:57,211 --> 00:20:00,260
constitution and they don't want this 
constitution loopholes.

483
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,880
I'm gonna tell you something,
man.

484
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:07,290
They found out that no one has to pay.
Taxes goes down.

485
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,813
People.
There's a lot of people that actually 

486
00:20:09,781 --> 00:20:10,614
had that conversation with me telling me
that you don't have to pay taxes and 

487
00:20:14,731 --> 00:20:15,564
that the constitution says that the only
time we were supposed to pay taxes is 

488
00:20:18,691 --> 00:20:19,524
during war and that's when they came up 
with federal taxes in the first place 

489
00:20:22,651 --> 00:20:25,590
and it's not legal and that's why they 
can't really charge you with it.

490
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:28,680
If you just resist like bitch,
they will put you in a cage,

491
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,860
take all your money and we'll put you in
a cage.

492
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:32,983
Like it is a one time.
There's two really fascinating things 

493
00:20:35,491 --> 00:20:36,324
when it comes to money.
That's a really fascinating one and 

494
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:39,840
said,
if you don't pay your taxes,

495
00:20:39,841 --> 00:20:42,870
it's one of those debts were it doesn't 
matter.

496
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:45,450
You go to fucking jail like you go to 
jail.

497
00:20:45,451 --> 00:20:48,700
They take everything you have the law,
even if you have no ability to pay it.

498
00:20:48,701 --> 00:20:51,160
When you get out,
you still owe it and you go to jail.

499
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:54,160
That's fascinating because you can't 
just pay it off.

500
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:54,761
It's not like,
Oh,

501
00:20:54,761 --> 00:20:57,190
you owed $50,000
in back taxes.

502
00:20:57,191 --> 00:20:58,024
No,
you fucking lied to us about paying 

503
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,910
money.
So now you go to jail.

504
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,430
Like you weren't honest.
So it's not just you owe the money,

505
00:21:03,431 --> 00:21:04,780
now you pay it,
now you're clean.

506
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,180
No,
no,

507
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:05,681
no,
no.

508
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:06,514
You go to jail,
we take all your money and then you get 

509
00:21:08,831 --> 00:21:09,664
out and you hadn't made money in a long 
time and now you've got to get back on 

510
00:21:11,591 --> 00:21:12,740
your feet and fuck you.

511
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:14,223
Fuck you.
And the other time the PS fuck you is 

512
00:21:15,881 --> 00:21:16,714
student loans.
So one thing that you can't fucking go 

513
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,270
bankrupt.
Wealth,

514
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:25,000
that's horrible.
That is the worst idea ever.

515
00:21:25,001 --> 00:21:25,834
Saddled down.
Young impulsive children who are just 

516
00:21:28,151 --> 00:21:32,230
getting out of their parents' grasp,
saddle them down with debt and then have

517
00:21:32,231 --> 00:21:34,780
them enter into a diminishing job 
market.

518
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,380
And if you start off something in 2016,
what are the fucking odds?

519
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:40,720
Especially if it's tech related,
that anything you learned is going to be

520
00:21:40,721 --> 00:21:43,090
applicable in four years.
Well,

521
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:45,100
I mean if you want to talk about the 
university system,

522
00:21:45,101 --> 00:21:45,934
I mean,
you know,

523
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,773
there's a.
there's a ship that is sinking pretty 

524
00:21:48,191 --> 00:21:50,440
damn fast and a whole lot of stuff,
isn't it?

525
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,543
Having Jordan Peterson on your podcast.
You guys had them before I had them on 

526
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,830
and I've been paying attention to his 
work for a long time.

527
00:21:58,850 --> 00:21:59,683
He's one of the few people that are out 
standing out there in the river 

528
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:04,420
screaming,
you know?

529
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,650
I mean,
that's what he's doing.

530
00:22:05,651 --> 00:22:06,460
He's like,
this is.

531
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,110
You guys are.
This is madness.

532
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,540
You guys aren't being honest about 
things here.

533
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:13,510
Did you see this recent thing with this 
women's March?

534
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,393
It was in the New York Times.
They're separating the women by color 

535
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,053
and white women are being told to check 
their privilege in this March against 

536
00:22:22,901 --> 00:22:25,240
discrimination and privilege.
We're going to find that.

537
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,640
See,
I put that up on my twitter,

538
00:22:27,641 --> 00:22:28,474
pulled it up because it's fucking 
hilarious and this is not some fringe 

539
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,253
newspaper.
This New York Times printing this and 

540
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:35,374
Michael Shermer posted it,
women's march on Washington opens 

541
00:22:38,321 --> 00:22:40,930
contentious dialogues about race.
Well,

542
00:22:40,931 --> 00:22:42,160
let's,
what is the,

543
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:42,994
uh,
what was the headline that was on my 

544
00:22:44,231 --> 00:22:47,370
twitter thing about it?
Because the headlines Hilarious.

545
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:49,990
Look at what,
what schirmer said.

546
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,390
Oh,
to protest racism now,

547
00:22:52,391 --> 00:22:56,200
dividing women by skin color whites told
to check your privilege.

548
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:57,723
Get the fuck Outta here.
And that's what you were talking about 

549
00:22:59,621 --> 00:23:02,770
with power and power corrupting.
That is power.

550
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:03,933
That's one of the thing that's going on 
with this social justice warrior 

551
00:23:05,891 --> 00:23:06,724
movement is not just people deciding 
that some people should be more ethical 

552
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:12,060
or kind or loving or open a progressive.
No,

553
00:23:12,061 --> 00:23:12,550
no,
no.

554
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,383
It's exerting power over people to 
enforce your standard of thinking and 

555
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:20,060
driving on them.
That's a giant problem.

556
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,850
And that's what Jordan Peterson is 
fighting.

557
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,580
Well,
and it's the power of a adjust cause,

558
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,750
right?
Okay.

559
00:23:25,751 --> 00:23:27,880
You're fighting racism,
you're fighting sexism.

560
00:23:27,881 --> 00:23:30,120
Like these are things to fight.
Like I'm,

561
00:23:30,121 --> 00:23:33,880
I'm all down with you.
But the fact that you know,

562
00:23:33,881 --> 00:23:36,160
if,
if you have any problem with it,

563
00:23:36,161 --> 00:23:38,020
right?
Jordan Peterson takes issue with some of

564
00:23:38,021 --> 00:23:39,040
that behavior there.

565
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:39,883
Then like,
so you're saying racism and sexism and 

566
00:23:41,951 --> 00:23:43,960
discrimination are okay.
Of course,

567
00:23:43,961 --> 00:23:46,790
no one saying the stupid game that they 
play.

568
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:47,624
Exactly.
They try to paint you into a corner 

569
00:23:48,681 --> 00:23:51,890
instantaneously with their opening 
statement while you're a bigot.

570
00:23:51,891 --> 00:23:53,060
So you know,
Oh,

571
00:23:53,061 --> 00:23:54,860
I'm a bigot.
Is that what's really going on?

572
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,990
Just because we disagree on things.
I'm a bigot.

573
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:57,901
Yeah.
And,

574
00:23:57,901 --> 00:23:59,210
and if you look at,
I mean the,

575
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,310
the argument I think particularly about 
pronouns,

576
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:04,520
it really comes down to a linguistic one
in the sense that,

577
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,320
you know,
words are tools,

578
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,180
right?
And so if you look,

579
00:24:08,181 --> 00:24:09,014
if you want to talk about pronouns,
look at English and the time of 

580
00:24:11,091 --> 00:24:12,020
Shakespeare,
right?

581
00:24:12,021 --> 00:24:13,160
They had this,
this thing,

582
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:16,430
thou right,
it was another pronoun and then they got

583
00:24:16,431 --> 00:24:17,810
the fuck rid of it.
Right.

584
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,700
And why did they get rid of it?
Because they were like,

585
00:24:19,701 --> 00:24:21,440
man doesn't really add anything good.

586
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,190
When you say to that,
and it sounds fancy,

587
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:28,100
but it's not,
it doesn't practically add anything.

588
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,390
Right?
So it was,

589
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,253
it was.
It's the same thing as the romance 

590
00:24:30,981 --> 00:24:33,440
languages where it was a distinction 
between formal and informal,

591
00:24:33,441 --> 00:24:34,274
you and essentially we decided we didn't
need that distinction so that Pronoun 

592
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:40,010
dropped away and in general that's what 
has happened over time.

593
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:40,990
That's a big part of,
you know,

594
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:41,953
Joe Hendricks work is that language 
simplifies over time the tools become 

595
00:24:45,501 --> 00:24:50,501
more and more powerful and more refined 
and the same way that say a stone tools,

596
00:24:50,511 --> 00:24:52,190
right?
You see the early stone tools,

597
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:55,970
their shit and then over time they get 
more and more elegant and more refined.

598
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,103
The same thing as being happening with 
language for the entirety of human 

599
00:24:59,781 --> 00:25:01,250
history.
They get whittled down.

600
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,570
So what the fuck do you think happens if
you introduced 70 gender pronouns?

601
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,673
Well you might get equality.
Fucking racist cisgendered piece of 

602
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,440
shit.
You Shit.

603
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,990
That's a problem Joe,
is for guys like us,

604
00:25:14,991 --> 00:25:15,824
we have so much privilege.
Like we're going to be there like 

605
00:25:17,961 --> 00:25:20,750
checking it in like half an hour,
an hour.

606
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:23,410
We have to even out the world.
That is true.

607
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:24,583
The world must be evened out,
so there's no more competition by the 

608
00:25:27,081 --> 00:25:27,914
way,
which is one of the more hilarious 

609
00:25:28,701 --> 00:25:31,780
things about people that actually think 
that they're communist shut.

610
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,653
Just shut your fucking mouth,
but if you are and you really do 

611
00:25:35,871 --> 00:25:37,940
subscribe to that guarantee,
you're not contributing.

612
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,890
You're like one of those hippies that 
always wants.

613
00:25:39,891 --> 00:25:41,870
We'd never bring some,
you know,

614
00:25:41,871 --> 00:25:44,480
come on man,
that's old shit about you bring your own

615
00:25:44,481 --> 00:25:46,820
weed.
You they never have it.

616
00:25:46,821 --> 00:25:48,740
Right?
And that's the communist people,

617
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,820
the people that are really into the idea
of communism on theory about everybody's

618
00:25:52,821 --> 00:25:54,440
sharing and not worrying about money.

619
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,690
There'll be great.
There's only the three of us.

620
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:59,180
We were the only people in the world.
This is my example that I always love to

621
00:25:59,181 --> 00:26:00,014
use.
If was the three of us and there was 

622
00:26:01,611 --> 00:26:04,010
like $3,000,000
in the world and we all said,

623
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,540
oh,
it's all just split it up like.

624
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:06,403
And then money won't be nothing.
It's just we'll just trade back and 

625
00:26:08,511 --> 00:26:09,770
forth and everything should be even 
okay.

626
00:26:09,771 --> 00:26:11,570
Cool.
And we'd be fine with that.

627
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:12,923
And then we go on about our merry way,
but there's too many fucking people and 

628
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:16,124
there's inevitably going to be going to 
be some form of competition and it's 

629
00:26:18,711 --> 00:26:19,544
some form of competition.
Some people are going to get out ahead 

630
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:22,243
and it's going to be some people that 
are upset that people were ahead and 

631
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,673
it's gonna be all sorts of reasons.
Some people are going to be at the head 

632
00:26:26,241 --> 00:26:27,110
because they're assholes.

633
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,780
Some people are going to be head because
they get up at 5:00

634
00:26:29,781 --> 00:26:31,610
in the morning while you sleep till 
fucking noon.

635
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:34,010
That's true too.
These are all true.

636
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:35,203
There's some people that are totally 
ethical and they just do a lot of work 

637
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,830
and they do better.
They're going to do better.

638
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:42,050
They didn't steal from anybody,
they didn't rip anybody off.

639
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:42,913
But this narrative keeps getting 
repeated by people who don't get up at 

640
00:26:45,631 --> 00:26:46,464
7:00
in the morning or don't have the same 

641
00:26:47,911 --> 00:26:48,744
kind of ambition or feel bad because 
some people do want a fucking private 

642
00:26:52,051 --> 00:26:55,800
jet and fly all over the world and ball 
like Dan Bilzerian.

643
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,110
It's all these things are true.
I mean,

644
00:26:58,111 --> 00:27:01,900
it's both things,
it's like you can be an ethical person,

645
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:02,743
it'd be like a super ambitious,
crazy person and wants to succeed in 

646
00:27:05,191 --> 00:27:07,410
business for some reason.
They're not mutually exclusive.

647
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:08,243
Nope.
So when everybody says capitalism is 

648
00:27:09,421 --> 00:27:11,250
evil and it's the problem,
man.

649
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:11,881
No,
no,

650
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:13,800
no.
You saying that it's a problem.

651
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,083
It's not a problem.
The whole reason why you have a fucking 

652
00:27:16,561 --> 00:27:19,740
laptop to complain on is because of 
capitalism.

653
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:20,993
And the point is is that the lesson of 
2016 is that there are a lot of shit 

654
00:27:24,331 --> 00:27:25,164
ideas out there and there shit ideas 
spread all around the political 

655
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,100
spectrum.
Right?

656
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,293
And the.
I think the challenge of 2017 is how do 

657
00:27:32,071 --> 00:27:32,904
we kill those ideas,
but also in the defense of the people 

658
00:27:35,131 --> 00:27:37,590
that are anti corporate or Anti 
Corporation,

659
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:42,330
there is an issue when these gigantic 
groups get together and they're only.

660
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:45,960
They're only motivation is acquiring 
more money every year.

661
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,873
Right?
That does become a problem and then 

662
00:27:47,851 --> 00:27:48,684
there's a diffusion of responsibility 
when you're locked into that giant 

663
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:51,504
system and you're just a middle manager 
of some Exxon group that's fucking kill 

664
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,630
and seals and you don't give a shit.

665
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:59,100
You know,
those poor seals.

666
00:27:59,101 --> 00:28:00,270
What are they living in the Arctic 
anyway?

667
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,513
Loyalists.
Stupid fucking seals covered up with 

668
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:04,470
soil.
You know,

669
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,560
it becomes that,
right?

670
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:08,940
It becomes.
You're just a part of the thing.

671
00:28:08,941 --> 00:28:11,160
But look,
I got a new BMW drives itself.

672
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,840
Hey guys,
we got a house in the hamptons.

673
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,390
Everybody's happy.
And that's a problem too.

674
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:17,190
So there's,
there's two problems.

675
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,140
There's,
well there's a million of them,

676
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,780
but that's,
that is a problem with money too.

677
00:28:21,781 --> 00:28:26,730
It's like it might be the issue,
might be corporations in itself might be

678
00:28:26,731 --> 00:28:29,220
a problem.
Like that is a power thing.

679
00:28:29,221 --> 00:28:31,380
Like you're talking about.
Absolute power will look.

680
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:34,710
The problem is not power per se,
it's unchecked power.

681
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,240
Right?
And so,

682
00:28:36,241 --> 00:28:37,770
I mean the founding fathers understood 
that.

683
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,100
That's why you had checks and balances 
and the problem is,

684
00:28:41,101 --> 00:28:43,380
is that a lot of the checks and balances
on,

685
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,940
you know,
intellectuals,

686
00:28:44,941 --> 00:28:45,240
right?

687
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,580
What's happening at universities have 
broken down,

688
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,010
right?
And the checks on corporations,

689
00:28:50,011 --> 00:28:51,510
which is government,
right,

690
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,613
is broken down and the check on 
government is the people and that's 

691
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:55,734
broken down.
And so what's happened is in a lot of 

692
00:28:57,331 --> 00:28:58,164
the checks and balances have failed and 
the ultimate check and balance is the 

693
00:29:00,541 --> 00:29:02,240
people.
But the problem is,

694
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:03,074
is that you can't get the wisdom of 
crowds if the crowd isn't wise and it's 

695
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:11,211
not a real big fucking problem.
One and so good statement.

696
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:12,580
And the,
the problem is,

697
00:29:12,581 --> 00:29:15,270
is that a large part of this is these 
are large historical forces,

698
00:29:15,271 --> 00:29:17,580
namely specialization.
So you know,

699
00:29:17,581 --> 00:29:18,810
if we get,
you know,

700
00:29:18,811 --> 00:29:21,570
the 300 million people in America,
it's not that everybody's an idiot,

701
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:22,560
right?
It's that,

702
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:25,230
oh,
you're a lawyer and you know the law and

703
00:29:25,231 --> 00:29:27,540
you know nothing else,
right?

704
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:30,810
Or you are a teacher and you know your 
subject,

705
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:31,441
you know,
history,

706
00:29:31,441 --> 00:29:32,071
you know,
whatever.

707
00:29:32,071 --> 00:29:32,904
Right?
Or if you go into academia and you talk 

708
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,390
to a bunch of scientists,
you'll find,

709
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:36,991
oh,
you know,

710
00:29:36,991 --> 00:29:41,991
your sub discipline of psychology,
of biology and chemistry of and

711
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:44,710
literally nothing else that is happening
in science.

712
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,400
So the problem is,
is that what that happens is if you look

713
00:29:48,401 --> 00:29:49,660
at the founding fathers,
they,

714
00:29:49,661 --> 00:29:51,340
they read really,
really widely.

715
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,600
Um,
and you know,

716
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:53,523
I was recently involved in a 
intellectual dispute with some 

717
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:57,430
libertarians.
Right?

718
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:58,443
And so I went to libertarianism.org
where it's just run by the Cato 

719
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:02,583
Institute.
What was the intellectual dispute 

720
00:30:03,191 --> 00:30:04,024
regarding.
So my big beef that I've been taking is 

721
00:30:06,191 --> 00:30:08,980
with fundamentalists and across the 
board,

722
00:30:08,981 --> 00:30:10,840
across the board,
I don't really have a car.

723
00:30:10,841 --> 00:30:13,090
I don't really care what kind of 
fundamentalist you are.

724
00:30:13,091 --> 00:30:16,690
I have an issue with fundamentalism in 
general and if you look at what you were

725
00:30:16,691 --> 00:30:17,530
just doing,
Joe,

726
00:30:17,531 --> 00:30:21,040
is that you were able to hold two 
contradictory thoughts in your mind.

727
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,360
Right?
I think it's important.

728
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,343
It's incredibly important.
You were able to say there's a problem 

729
00:30:25,781 --> 00:30:26,614
with people who oppose capitalism and 
there's a problem with much of what 

730
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:29,980
corporations are doing.

731
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,173
And then that's how you know,
you start to figure out reality is 

732
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:35,470
you're like,
oh fuck,

733
00:30:35,471 --> 00:30:38,080
there are these two opposing things.
How do I reconcile them?

734
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,700
And you have to go around,
you have to think,

735
00:30:39,701 --> 00:30:40,930
you have to read,
you have to talk to people,

736
00:30:40,931 --> 00:30:41,764
you have to do all that sort of stuff.
Fundamentalists aren't burdened with 

737
00:30:43,751 --> 00:30:44,584
that problem.
They have a much easier time because 

738
00:30:47,291 --> 00:30:48,124
they know that they are the good guys.
They know that there is one thing that 

739
00:30:51,191 --> 00:30:52,024
is the answer to all of our problems and
that there is one thing that is bad and 

740
00:30:55,721 --> 00:30:59,230
whatever that bad thing is,
we can just get rid of that bad thing.

741
00:30:59,231 --> 00:31:00,064
Then all of our problems will be solved.
And then they go about figuring out how 

742
00:31:03,221 --> 00:31:06,070
to strip away more and more and more of 
that bad thing.

743
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,083
Right?
So you look at the obvious example is 

744
00:31:08,801 --> 00:31:10,000
Islamic fundamentalism.

745
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,130
They're like,
it's the way of the profit.

746
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,410
We just have to live the way of the 
Prophet Mohammed.

747
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:17,680
And so then we have to strip out 
anything that interferes with that,

748
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:21,000
like toothbrushes and kites and you 
know,

749
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,113
women's education.
We're driving around all these really 

750
00:31:25,631 --> 00:31:27,070
problematic things.
Right.

751
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,143
And you know,
it's not that the prophet Mohammed 

752
00:31:29,261 --> 00:31:30,094
didn't have a toothbrush,
it was just a stick toothbrush and you 

753
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:33,220
know,
I'm not a dentist,

754
00:31:33,221 --> 00:31:36,270
but I think that an oral b is better 
than a stick toothbrush.

755
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,001
Dick.
He,

756
00:31:37,001 --> 00:31:40,240
they had like sticks that were like 
bristled at the end or something.

757
00:31:40,241 --> 00:31:41,074
Like they would break up the stick.
Then you just get that stick in there 

758
00:31:43,461 --> 00:31:44,294
and.
Yeah.

759
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:46,600
So you're supposed to use that today to 
this day.

760
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,680
Well,
if you listen to some of Moms,

761
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,570
yeah.
Wow.

762
00:31:49,571 --> 00:31:51,010
If you want to go super,
super deep.

763
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:51,820
Yeah.
Well,

764
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,653
exactly.
That's the point that it's always about 

765
00:31:53,681 --> 00:31:54,790
going super,
super deep.

766
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:56,950
It's not the case with Christianity and 
all religions,

767
00:31:56,951 --> 00:31:57,784
right?
That's,

768
00:31:58,090 --> 00:31:59,460
there's people that are just,
you know,

769
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,500
kind of like casual Christians just like
us.

770
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:04,930
People that are casual Muslims and then 
there's people that go whole hog.

771
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:07,600
That's right.
I think that the reckoning is coming.

772
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:08,973
Jesus is on his way and that's better 
pack your bags because you're going to 

773
00:32:11,501 --> 00:32:12,334
need clothes and having people that are 
packed and ready for Jesus to take them 

774
00:32:15,521 --> 00:32:16,100
away

775
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:20,000
and those people give the rest of 
Christianity or the rest of Islam.

776
00:32:20,001 --> 00:32:20,210
Yes,

777
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:21,043
bad name,
but they also give us amazing movies 

778
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:26,630
left behind and left behind too.
I don't know if you've seen them,

779
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:29,300
but they're Kirk Cameron's greatest 
word,

780
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:35,160
a ratable work of comedy that he didn't 
know his comedy while he was making.

781
00:32:36,141 --> 00:32:37,850
Oh dude,
it's so bad.

782
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:40,730
Have you seen it?
Left behind and left behind too.

783
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:43,100
It's so good.
I bought it on vhs.

784
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:46,430
I saw it at Walmart and I snatched it up
like a greet each child.

785
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,490
I'm going to write this down.
Left,

786
00:32:48,491 --> 00:32:49,324
right and left behind too.
I'm sure you can probably get it on 

787
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,393
itunes or something.
It's on itunes or Netflix and find out 

788
00:32:55,311 --> 00:32:58,250
where people can watch it because it's 
fucking unbelievably bad.

789
00:32:58,830 --> 00:32:59,663
Somebody a youtube Amazon video or 
google play and it was based on these 

790
00:33:04,581 --> 00:33:06,800
cataclysmic books that were written by 
these.

791
00:33:06,801 --> 00:33:07,634
A loony tune dudes.
Is it one loony toon dude or two loony 

792
00:33:09,951 --> 00:33:12,020
toon dudes that wrote the left behind 
series.

793
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,240
He's a Christian guys,
and by the way,

794
00:33:14,241 --> 00:33:17,410
they've sold like 100 million copies of 
this fucking shit bag.

795
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:24,560
It's so dumb,
but it's amazing.

796
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,570
What's that?
Two guys.

797
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:31,480
Two guys can each other off in between.
I made that up.

798
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,110
Gay.
Don't get mad.

799
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:34,850
Don't get mad.
Don't sue me.

800
00:33:34,851 --> 00:33:38,060
I'm sure your books.
Amazing books the best,

801
00:33:38,061 --> 00:33:39,200
but my.
Take it back,

802
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:41,180
take it back.
I'm going to be a.

803
00:33:41,181 --> 00:33:42,014
I'm going to never forget some of Kirk 
Cameron's best work that growing pains 

804
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,710
as best work is avoiding Dick's.
Oh,

805
00:33:48,711 --> 00:33:50,420
is this it?
Oh Wow.

806
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,343
Yeah,
it's amazing.

807
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:52,820
It's just for us.
Yeah.

808
00:33:52,821 --> 00:33:53,654
This is for the cinematography and the 
fact that this is made in 2000 and 

809
00:33:56,241 --> 00:33:57,830
that's the cinematography.
Like,

810
00:33:57,831 --> 00:33:59,510
that's really impressive.
So adorable.

811
00:33:59,511 --> 00:34:01,310
He's adorable.
He religious.

812
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,590
Have you ever seen the one where uh,
ray comfort,

813
00:34:03,591 --> 00:34:04,424
who's his buddy and all these videos 
describes how a banana is an atheist 

814
00:34:07,581 --> 00:34:08,630
work.
Worst nightmare.

815
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,400
How wonderful is that?
Amazing.

816
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:14,360
So what's wonderful video and that's his
right hand man.

817
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:18,660
Like he's like,
God designed a banana specific purpose.

818
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,331
Like what?
Okay,

819
00:34:23,331 --> 00:34:24,164
well what is it?
Coconut fuckhead coconuts are more 

820
00:34:26,541 --> 00:34:27,980
nutritious it bananas.
Guess what?

821
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,300
Phase?
Really Shitty.

822
00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:31,940
Beating bananas.
She like one of them in a day.

823
00:34:31,941 --> 00:34:33,700
They're high in sugar.
Okay.

824
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:34,813
You really shouldn't be bananas Ray.
But wouldn't that be amazing if you 

825
00:34:38,031 --> 00:34:39,790
managed to convince Christians that 
like,

826
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:41,420
you know,
actually instead of the Eucharist,

827
00:34:41,421 --> 00:34:42,254
you should be eating bananas.
Some people that believe bananas are 

828
00:34:44,861 --> 00:34:46,400
like super good.
Well then your potassium,

829
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:47,323
there's something to them but the 
coconuts better for you and you got to 

830
00:34:49,311 --> 00:34:50,144
break that fucking thing open.
You got to get through that husk like 

831
00:34:52,041 --> 00:34:54,230
somebody had to figure out that husk.
Yeah.

832
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:57,290
And then the hard part,
you have to be so hungry.

833
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,263
You're banging on a brock and then 
luckily for you there's meat and water 

834
00:35:02,361 --> 00:35:04,160
inside.
Like wow,

835
00:35:04,161 --> 00:35:07,160
what are the odds?
You had to do a lot of work.

836
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,130
I bet it was probably somebody who's 
loved.

837
00:35:10,131 --> 00:35:10,964
One was killed by a falling coconut and 
got fucking pissed as smashed that 

838
00:35:14,661 --> 00:35:19,661
coconut with a rock thinking that 
coconut and killed their mom or somebody

839
00:35:19,791 --> 00:35:21,830
who killed their mom with that fucking 
coconut.

840
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:22,693
That to 150.
People die every year because coconuts 

841
00:35:25,851 --> 00:35:27,620
fall in their head.
What a way to go.

842
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,520
Twenty one people in America are killed 
by armed toddlers every year.

843
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:33,163
I think I would.
What would you rather go buy coconut or 

844
00:35:34,611 --> 00:35:35,444
toddler coconut all day?
I'll God dropping a rock on my head all 

845
00:35:39,751 --> 00:35:43,590
day to be in shot by a one year old.
A one year old.

846
00:35:43,591 --> 00:35:45,930
You like what?
I mean?

847
00:35:45,931 --> 00:35:46,764
I know you're tired.
Why'd you leave a loaded gun in your 

848
00:35:48,001 --> 00:35:50,740
purse and crazy bitch?
No,

849
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,450
you get mom.
Bernice,

850
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,230
maybe you should fucking keep that gun 
on your hip.

851
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,373
Yeah.
They leave guns and purses and they 

852
00:35:58,091 --> 00:36:00,030
leave the kids with the guns and the 
kids pull it.

853
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:00,873
Oh,
I see now on TV and they shoot mommy 21 

854
00:36:03,931 --> 00:36:06,150
people a year.
Think of that.

855
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:09,180
That's not a good way to go,
but in general,

856
00:36:09,181 --> 00:36:12,210
I mean that's two a month.
Yeah,

857
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,120
Bang.
One just probably happened right now.

858
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:19,020
It's like there's a timer that's going 
off like we're waiting.

859
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,360
It's like the slowest national debt 
clock.

860
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,133
We should have a arm toddler where you 
get a notification every time an rm 

861
00:36:29,791 --> 00:36:33,570
toddler kills a person because it's 21 a
year just in this country.

862
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:34,703
Well,
I think probably primarily in this 

863
00:36:35,911 --> 00:36:37,050
country.
Folks.

864
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,220
Get on that.
Who?

865
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:42,090
I'll promote your APP.
Please send it to me.

866
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,430
Tag Me on instagram.
Make that APP.

867
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,380
Will promoted the arm.
Toddler APP,

868
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:54,150
toddlers shootings in 2015.
Oh,

869
00:36:54,151 --> 00:36:56,820
1:13
says they killed more.

870
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:01,110
Oh my God is so that's 13 had 
inadvertently killed themselves.

871
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:01,973
Oh,
13 kids had killed themselves with 

872
00:37:03,181 --> 00:37:03,810
firearms.

873
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:08,140
13 more injured themselves.
10 injured other people and to killed.

874
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,330
Oh,
so there's only two.

875
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:11,340
This is this statement.
It was looking up.

876
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:16,350
The toddlers killed more Americans and 
terrorists in 2015.

877
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:18,000
But what?
How many do they kill?

878
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,253
It says they only killed two to have 
killed other people to killed other 

879
00:37:22,981 --> 00:37:24,090
people.
So toddlers,

880
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,760
they were suicide bombers who killed 
themselves.

881
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:28,830
That's the point.
Okay,

882
00:37:28,831 --> 00:37:31,230
so when you're saying that they killed 
15 people,

883
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:34,070
13 of those 15 were the baby themselves?
Yeah.

884
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:36,090
Oh,
well that's not the same.

885
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:37,290
Right?
That's not that,

886
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:39,330
but I've read.
Where is this?

887
00:37:39,331 --> 00:37:41,220
Where are you getting this from?
On snopes.

888
00:37:41,221 --> 00:37:43,230
I just typed indoor arm,
toddlers.

889
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:45,230
Do you know what?
Didn't we talk about snobs?

890
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,730
About the.
The Guy Married a hooker?

891
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:49,290
Yeah.
Yeah.

892
00:37:49,291 --> 00:37:51,990
The guy who owned snopes left,
his wife,

893
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:52,853
married a hooker,
a who had a website that's an act of 

894
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:01,040
escort website with reviews as recently 
as 2015 people reviewing.

895
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,240
So nothing wrong with being a hooker.
No,

896
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:05,190
that's cool.
But it's the oldest profession,

897
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,890
but when I think about a dude marrying a
hooker,

898
00:38:07,891 --> 00:38:09,660
I figured about a dude who's off the 
rails.

899
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:12,090
When you think about a dude in his 
fifties who marries an escort,

900
00:38:12,091 --> 00:38:12,511
I'm like,
oh,

901
00:38:12,511 --> 00:38:13,344
he might.
There's a 50 slash 50 chance that guy 

902
00:38:15,571 --> 00:38:16,404
might be out of his fucking mind.
So like one of the criticisms of snopes 

903
00:38:20,041 --> 00:38:20,874
during this election was that it wasn't.
There was a pro hillary bias to some of 

904
00:38:23,941 --> 00:38:28,680
the information that snopes was 
reporting on and apparently she had been

905
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:33,681
involved in some sort of an anti Bush 
anti anti Republican website in the past

906
00:38:35,801 --> 00:38:37,810
and you know,
leans left the whole deal,

907
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:43,440
so snobs might be a little wacky or not.
Maybe beside all those things,

908
00:38:43,811 --> 00:38:48,130
they still stick to the science thing.
I mean,

909
00:38:48,131 --> 00:38:49,780
you know,
wouldn't that be nice if people actually

910
00:38:49,781 --> 00:38:52,000
stuck to the statistics,
the facts,

911
00:38:52,001 --> 00:38:52,780
reality.

912
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,613
I would way rather have someone who goes
off and married some crazy escort lady 

913
00:38:56,531 --> 00:39:00,010
and they pull up to ecstasy every night,
but when it comes down to the work,

914
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:02,260
they do solid works because I'm a big 
old.

915
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,393
Oh Wow.
I was all her husband and wife now 

916
00:39:07,931 --> 00:39:10,210
married and that's the old.
There you go.

917
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:12,820
Happy couple.
Maybe they have a good time.

918
00:39:12,821 --> 00:39:15,550
The guy smiling.
It gives a shit if she got paid for sex,

919
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:18,670
people are so god damn prudish.
That's when she was at our best.

920
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:19,743
But presumably it's also like the weird 
thing always with fundamentalists and 

921
00:39:23,831 --> 00:39:24,664
like wanting to marry a virgin.
Like don't you want somebody who has 

922
00:39:26,741 --> 00:39:28,960
some experience with the old wife 
though?

923
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:31,110
She's mad dude.
Yeah,

924
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:34,670
she mad.
There should be like a meme just as.

925
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,840
Yeah.
Yeah,

926
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:38,561
I guess.
Yeah,

927
00:39:38,561 --> 00:39:40,420
you'd want someone who was experienced 
for sure.

928
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,373
You want someone who's worked at all the
toothy blow jobs so that when they get 

929
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:44,680
to you,
they know what they're doing.

930
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:45,693
Right.
And is there much of a difference 

931
00:39:46,451 --> 00:39:47,284
between a woman who gets paid for each 
individual sexual encounter versus a 

932
00:39:50,441 --> 00:39:53,640
woman who marries a guy for money,
which is pretty much same thing.

933
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,000
It's kind of the same thing.
Yeah.

934
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,133
Yeah.
I mean you just have one John for life 

935
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:59,850
or at least until you run out.
Yeah.

936
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:01,750
Until the Castillo's.
Exactly.

937
00:40:01,751 --> 00:40:06,610
Until they upgrade seat number for that.
Those guys like that's a,

938
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,530
that's the trump move.
You know,

939
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:10,403
those super rich dudes,
they keep getting smaller and more 

940
00:40:12,161 --> 00:40:15,640
baller or wife's like.
The new one is like God damn.

941
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,980
Little bit at a certain point like it.
That's a problem.

942
00:40:17,981 --> 00:40:21,190
He can't really.
He can't replace Melania.

943
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:22,840
Not while he's president.
Uh,

944
00:40:22,841 --> 00:40:23,560
with a hotter one.

945
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,221
Yeah.
Yes.

946
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:25,570
Again,
you think you can fuck,

947
00:40:25,571 --> 00:40:26,530
yeah.
Yeah.

948
00:40:26,531 --> 00:40:27,364
He's the king of dance halls.
How many people have come out of the 

949
00:40:30,221 --> 00:40:32,270
closet as assholes now?
You know,

950
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:33,823
I mean,
this is a rare time where it's not just 

951
00:40:36,131 --> 00:40:36,964
that he doesn't,
doesn't represent a lot of people that 

952
00:40:38,621 --> 00:40:40,180
wanted to lean more.
Right.

953
00:40:40,181 --> 00:40:43,750
And you're also represents a lot of men 
that are kind of dicks.

954
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:44,603
Yeah.
Right.

955
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:47,470
Right.
And they get excited about this.

956
00:40:47,471 --> 00:40:48,080
This is,
there's,

957
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:53,080
there's definitely more overt asshole 
behavior in the name of trump.

958
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:54,671
Yup.
You know,

959
00:40:54,671 --> 00:40:58,090
like he's tapped into that vein,
which I didn't really see.

960
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:01,180
I don't remember seeing that from any 
other candidate ever.

961
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:02,920
Well,
I think,

962
00:41:02,921 --> 00:41:03,491
uh,
you know,

963
00:41:03,491 --> 00:41:07,070
that frustration has been building a lot
for a long time with those guys.

964
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:10,900
They didn't get that representation to 
get kicked his wife out.

965
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:13,630
If she said something stupid,
she said,

966
00:41:13,631 --> 00:41:15,300
I'm tired of his breath.
Yeah.

967
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:19,060
Fuck him.
And he kicks it to the curb and I mean,

968
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:21,670
people would be like,
get rid of her donald.

969
00:41:21,671 --> 00:41:22,504
Get a new one.
Probably.

970
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:23,403
It'd be like a gigantic,
like nationwide woman hunt to find the 

971
00:41:26,531 --> 00:41:31,531
perfect person who just knows to do what
she's told and to just to,

972
00:41:31,961 --> 00:41:34,040
just to obey the and just

973
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,860
to take care of them.
And as long as she doesn't look too much

974
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:38,360
like Ivanka.
Right.

975
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:41,180
Just got to look hot as fuck for sure.
I mean,

976
00:41:41,181 --> 00:41:42,014
he's the God damn president of the 
United States and his wife is hot as 

977
00:41:44,271 --> 00:41:45,620
fuck.
He's going to go down.

978
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,540
No,
he's not going to get a less.

979
00:41:47,541 --> 00:41:50,030
He's only going to go down in age.
Yeah,

980
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,470
because he keeps going up.
Right.

981
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:54,290
He went with his first wife,
then with Marla Maples,

982
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,153
maples.
She was super hot and then this one is 

983
00:41:57,111 --> 00:41:59,480
even more super hot.
This one's off the charts.

984
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:01,340
Well,
Eastern European women.

985
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:03,740
Yeah.
What's that all about?

986
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:04,990
Uh,
well,

987
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:07,940
I think actually like a large part of it
is I think also cultural,

988
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:08,803
right?
There's a certain like arrogance that 

989
00:42:10,251 --> 00:42:12,800
eastern European women have where 
they're sort of like,

990
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,090
who are you?
Like,

991
00:42:14,091 --> 00:42:16,910
are you good enough for me?
There's a certain hottiness right.

992
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:20,510
And a certain skepticism,
like an unavailability emotionally.

993
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,780
Are you a racist?
What do you know?

994
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:23,540
I'm,
I'm thinking about generalist.

995
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,130
No,
but I'm speaking about culture.

996
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,330
This is outrageous.
Well,

997
00:42:26,331 --> 00:42:28,010
do you want to have outrageous 
conversations?

998
00:42:28,011 --> 00:42:29,090
Yeah,
I mean,

999
00:42:29,091 --> 00:42:31,040
he seemed like a guy who likes them,
right?

1000
00:42:31,041 --> 00:42:32,030
I do.
Yeah,

1001
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:33,320
I do.
But yeah.

1002
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,213
Do you think that's because of the war?
A lot of those Russian men died in the 

1003
00:42:38,631 --> 00:42:39,200
war.
I mean,

1004
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:43,100
there was a mass calling of males.
Right?

1005
00:42:43,101 --> 00:42:46,130
And that's part of a much,
much older phenomenon than the war.

1006
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,830
Right?
So in terms of cultural evolution,

1007
00:42:48,831 --> 00:42:52,670
the way that cultural evolution works is
we all have certain mindsets,

1008
00:42:52,671 --> 00:42:53,504
right?
So every human has optimism and 

1009
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:55,550
pessimism.
Right?

1010
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:57,950
But for example,
we talked about Americans earlier,

1011
00:42:57,951 --> 00:42:58,784
right?
And how outsiders see Americans and 

1012
00:43:00,201 --> 00:43:01,280
Americans are,
you know,

1013
00:43:01,281 --> 00:43:02,114
historically massively optimistic that 
even Alexis de Tocqueville when he came 

1014
00:43:05,601 --> 00:43:06,050
here,
right?

1015
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,730
A French guy comes here,
he's like,

1016
00:43:07,731 --> 00:43:10,010
Americans are so optimistic.
What is up with that?

1017
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,540
Right?
That's why we kicked ass on.

1018
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:13,040
Well,
but it is,

1019
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:14,670
I mean honestly,
like the,

1020
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,210
because their optimism has certain 
benefits,

1021
00:43:17,211 --> 00:43:19,250
which is that it makes you super 
productive.

1022
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:20,810
Right?
Super happy.

1023
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,620
And these have always been a large part 
of what American success is about,

1024
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:25,843
but optimism doesn't have a problem,
which is an optimism has a tendency to 

1025
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:30,710
make you delusional.
Right?

1026
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:32,960
Ah,
that's a problem.

1027
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:33,823
That's a problem.
And so if you look at what is the most 

1028
00:43:36,201 --> 00:43:38,180
optimistic group of humans on the 
planet,

1029
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,550
it's actors in Los Angeles,
right?

1030
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,610
Are they really the most optimistic you 
think?

1031
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:44,623
Well,
I think the people who are to move to 

1032
00:43:45,861 --> 00:43:47,060
La,
right?

1033
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:51,020
You have to really believe that out of 
all the people in the world that somehow

1034
00:43:51,021 --> 00:43:51,860
you're going to make it.

1035
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:52,783
Right?
So optimism is what attracts people out 

1036
00:43:54,861 --> 00:43:55,694
here.
But then what happens is that a lot of 

1037
00:43:57,381 --> 00:43:59,600
them end up sort of sitting in optimism,
right?

1038
00:43:59,601 --> 00:44:01,190
They're always sitting there and being 
like,

1039
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:03,050
I'm going to get discovered.
I'm going to get discovered.

1040
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,400
I'm going to win the lottery.
Right?

1041
00:44:04,401 --> 00:44:05,234
Essentially,
it's that sort of mindset and then 

1042
00:44:06,681 --> 00:44:08,390
they're just waiting for things to 
happen.

1043
00:44:08,391 --> 00:44:10,490
They don't have an actual plan for going
about it.

1044
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,280
That's obviously not true of all actors.
Some people are like,

1045
00:44:13,281 --> 00:44:14,210
man,
okay,

1046
00:44:14,211 --> 00:44:15,710
I'm out here now.
If I'm going to make it,

1047
00:44:15,711 --> 00:44:17,480
I need to hustle,
I need to do things,

1048
00:44:17,481 --> 00:44:18,314
I need to do all that sort of stuff,
but there is that trajectory for actors 

1049
00:44:21,261 --> 00:44:23,300
who come out here hoping they're going 
to get discovered,

1050
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:25,730
you know,
are waiting to be discovered for 40,

1051
00:44:25,731 --> 00:44:27,980
50 years and then like,
Oh shit,

1052
00:44:27,981 --> 00:44:31,070
I'm 70,
and then they crash and then,

1053
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,580
you know,
they become the super depressed,

1054
00:44:32,581 --> 00:44:35,520
cynical actors who sit around like,
you know,

1055
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:36,960
being like,
fuck the industry.

1056
00:44:36,961 --> 00:44:38,590
The industry is the fucking worst.

1057
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:42,900
Exactly.
Because people are rough to be around.

1058
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,570
They are rough to be around.
I'm just spit it out.

1059
00:44:45,571 --> 00:44:46,404
It's all negative.
It's like coming out of them like a 

1060
00:44:47,611 --> 00:44:48,444
sprinkler system and that is where a lot
of middle America is right now because 

1061
00:44:51,781 --> 00:44:53,760
they've had this hope of the American 
dream,

1062
00:44:53,761 --> 00:44:55,050
the American dream,
the American dream,

1063
00:44:55,051 --> 00:44:57,120
the American dream.
And then there's,

1064
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:58,980
those hopes have been crushed,
right?

1065
00:44:58,981 --> 00:45:01,380
It hasn't delivered.
It hasn't panned out the way that it was

1066
00:45:01,381 --> 00:45:02,214
supposed to.
And so you're seeing a lot of pessimism 

1067
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:06,630
and you know,
which is the opposite side.

1068
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:10,230
And pessimism has certain strengths and 
the strengths of pessimism.

1069
00:45:10,231 --> 00:45:11,064
It's that constructive paranoia we 
talked about that they practice in Papa 

1070
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:15,143
New Guinea,
which is that you're super alive to 

1071
00:45:15,841 --> 00:45:16,674
threats,
but you're actually so alive to threats 

1072
00:45:18,421 --> 00:45:20,280
that you see threats that aren't even 
there.

1073
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:21,330
Right?
You're paranoid,

1074
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:21,990
right?

1075
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:23,500
Um,
but the problem is,

1076
00:45:23,501 --> 00:45:25,740
is that it also comes with substance 
abuse.

1077
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:27,660
Um,
so you find that,

1078
00:45:27,661 --> 00:45:28,620
you know,
for example,

1079
00:45:28,621 --> 00:45:29,454
what's happening in middle America,
there's a lot of substance abuse going 

1080
00:45:31,081 --> 00:45:33,360
on,
on all of these opioid addictions,

1081
00:45:33,361 --> 00:45:34,710
all that sort of stuff.
Right?

1082
00:45:34,711 --> 00:45:37,890
But don't you think that's a function of
being exposed to those things as much as

1083
00:45:37,891 --> 00:45:39,900
it's a function of the society that we 
live in,

1084
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,660
it's those things are super dangerous to
be exposed to.

1085
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:45,840
And because of these corporations that 
we were talking about,

1086
00:45:45,841 --> 00:45:47,370
the concept want to up their bottom 
line,

1087
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,280
they're selling these things and pushing
them on doctor.

1088
00:45:50,281 --> 00:45:51,390
So it's,
I mean,

1089
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:56,570
that could be as much as the cause of 
despair as a symptom of the issue.

1090
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:57,683
Well,
right,

1091
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:00,060
of course,
of course that's a factor.

1092
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,610
But at the same time,
look at Russia right?

1093
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,670
Russia is a place that is famous for 
substance abuse,

1094
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:06,180
right?

1095
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,013
Thirty point five percent of Russians 
die from alcohol related causes and 

1096
00:46:10,651 --> 00:46:12,900
that's as compared to say three percent 
in America,

1097
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:14,003
right?
So 10 times as many Russians are dying 

1098
00:46:15,751 --> 00:46:19,230
from alcohol related causes and they 
drank fucking anything,

1099
00:46:19,231 --> 00:46:20,064
right?
Like they pioneer weird fucking drugs 

1100
00:46:21,451 --> 00:46:24,630
like Krokodil that are just like fucking
gnarly.

1101
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:30,120
It's either exposed bones and they're 
there periodically.

1102
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:32,190
There's all this weird stuff that 
happens in Russia where,

1103
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:33,720
for example,
they'll drink like,

1104
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:36,090
you know,
some weird detergent,

1105
00:46:36,091 --> 00:46:36,924
some glade plug in or something like 
that because there's a tiny bit of 

1106
00:46:38,821 --> 00:46:39,970
alcohol in it,
right?

1107
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,333
So there's a certain psychology that 
comes with that massive pessimism and 

1108
00:46:44,461 --> 00:46:48,150
that massive pessimism evolve because of
the context of Russian history,

1109
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:49,890
right?
So Russian history,

1110
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:53,730
if you ever want to truly be depressed,
just read some Russian history,

1111
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:55,170
right?
That'll do it for you.

1112
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:57,210
And you find that like,
I mean,

1113
00:46:57,211 --> 00:46:59,220
Russia has always been a meat grinder,
right?

1114
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:01,320
It just chews people up and spits them 
out.

1115
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:05,340
And so the way that you survive in that 
environment is being massively paranoid,

1116
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,900
right?
The winter will kill you,

1117
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,000
right?
The leadership will kill you.

1118
00:47:09,001 --> 00:47:10,560
There all sorts of things that will kill
you.

1119
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:14,610
And so the Eastern European mindset 
tends towards this massive,

1120
00:47:14,611 --> 00:47:15,444
massive pessimism and the pessimism is 
useful in the same way that it is for 

1121
00:47:18,211 --> 00:47:19,044
the Papa New Guinea.
Ian's where you're massively alive to 

1122
00:47:20,431 --> 00:47:21,264
possible threats,
but it sets up these problems and the 

1123
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:26,550
problems that it sets up our substance 
abuse.

1124
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:27,683
And it also sets up the problem of sort 
of anticipating threats that aren't 

1125
00:47:31,151 --> 00:47:34,210
actually there and just overall despair.
Yep.

1126
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:35,793
And so what ends up happening is,
is that there's then the problem that 

1127
00:47:37,871 --> 00:47:40,120
pessimists and optimists misunderstand 
each other,

1128
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:42,190
right?
They don't get each other right.

1129
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:43,293
The optimist is like,
you're just fucking depressing and you 

1130
00:47:46,211 --> 00:47:47,044
know,
sort of see threats that aren't there 

1131
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:50,680
and like,
your life sucks and the pessimists looks

1132
00:47:50,681 --> 00:47:53,050
at the optimists and it's like,
you're fucking delusional dude.

1133
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:53,933
Like you got to get real.
You've got to understand how things 

1134
00:47:55,091 --> 00:47:55,924
really work.
So if you look at what happens in 

1135
00:47:57,371 --> 00:47:58,204
Russian and American relations,
what happens is that you'll have to the 

1136
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:04,090
same situation but interpreted in two 
totally different ways.

1137
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:05,223
So after the fall of the Berlin Wall,
the United States made some sort of 

1138
00:48:08,561 --> 00:48:09,394
promise or some sort of intimation that 
it would not expand NATO any further 

1139
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:17,050
east and the Russians were took that as,
okay,

1140
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:19,450
you're not expanding NATO any further 
east.

1141
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,830
Right?
But in fact,

1142
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:23,500
what ended up happening is the United 
States and the West,

1143
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:25,510
and it's sort of oblivious hopefulness.
It's like,

1144
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:27,340
let's keep expanding NATO,
right?

1145
00:48:27,341 --> 00:48:29,260
They didn't take this comment very 
seriously,

1146
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:30,303
and they moved NATO all the way to 
Estonia all the way to the Russian 

1147
00:48:32,891 --> 00:48:33,724
border.
Now the Russian sitting on their site 

1148
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:37,660
interpret that as a violation of the 
promise.

1149
00:48:37,661 --> 00:48:40,000
So sitting there as the pessimists that 
they are,

1150
00:48:40,001 --> 00:48:41,500
they're tracking each of these moves.

1151
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:41,941
They're like,
oh,

1152
00:48:41,941 --> 00:48:43,570
okay,
you're moving to another country over.

1153
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:46,480
You're moving in another country over.
We see what you're doing.

1154
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:47,343
And that's a lot of what the tension 
that boiled up between Russia and 

1155
00:48:49,991 --> 00:48:51,970
America was about.
Well,

1156
00:48:51,971 --> 00:48:52,804
don't you think right now?
Rushes in the weirdest place ever with 

1157
00:48:55,091 --> 00:48:58,990
Putin because he's essentially a 
dictator is a dictator,

1158
00:48:59,020 --> 00:48:59,853
right?
Right out in front of you as a dictator 

1159
00:49:01,691 --> 00:49:06,010
and all of his.
All of the people that are opposing him,

1160
00:49:06,011 --> 00:49:08,800
they weren't getting murdered really 
publicly yet,

1161
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:11,470
but that's because the dictators are 
godfathers.

1162
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:12,970
That's what they're.
They are.

1163
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:14,470
And you,
you know,

1164
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:17,800
father's household well on the sentiment
in Russian culture that.

1165
00:49:17,801 --> 00:49:18,634
No,
just to dictators in general who is 

1166
00:49:19,571 --> 00:49:21,340
Kadafi?
Who is Saddam Hussein?

1167
00:49:21,341 --> 00:49:22,980
Who are any of these guys?
They,

1168
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:25,360
they functioned as the godfather of 
their society.

1169
00:49:25,361 --> 00:49:28,300
So there's basically,
you know what you want the,

1170
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,820
there's an I should clarify just so that
people know.

1171
00:49:30,821 --> 00:49:31,654
Where is this all coming from?
This is all coming from books and 

1172
00:49:32,831 --> 00:49:35,860
interviewing academics and if you are 
curious about anything,

1173
00:49:35,861 --> 00:49:37,630
tweet me,
let me know.

1174
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:39,940
And if there's any comments that you're 
curious about,

1175
00:49:39,941 --> 00:49:40,774
I'll direct you to the book and you can 
go read it and you can work your way up 

1176
00:49:42,641 --> 00:49:43,474
the science chain and figure it out.
There's an onslaught of Dick pics to be 

1177
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:49,180
tweeted to.
Exactly.

1178
00:49:49,181 --> 00:49:50,410
Or,
or Dick Pics.

1179
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,670
I don't know what I'll do with those,
but you know,

1180
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:56,680
when you want to send them back for 
gifting.

1181
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:03,640
So I'm a Russian civilization.
Where were we?

1182
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:04,710
So,
so there's,

1183
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:06,280
there's essentially,
if you look at,

1184
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:08,260
if we talk about those hunter gatherers,
right?

1185
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:11,650
They have a two big problems,
right?

1186
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:15,000
One big problem is band level genocide.
So what'll happen is,

1187
00:50:15,001 --> 00:50:19,360
is that periodically one tribal just go 
and wipe the other fucking tribe out,

1188
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:21,520
right?
They'll kill them down to the last man,

1189
00:50:21,521 --> 00:50:23,530
they'll kill the babies,
they'll do all that sort of stuff.

1190
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:25,870
And this can happen super,
super quickly.

1191
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:29,300
So what'll jared diamond when we had him
on the podcast,

1192
00:50:29,301 --> 00:50:32,390
he told this great story about,
you know,

1193
00:50:32,391 --> 00:50:34,130
there's these two tribes in Papa New 
Guinea.

1194
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:36,920
They've been living side by side for 
years and years and years,

1195
00:50:36,921 --> 00:50:38,900
perfectly happily.
They love each other,

1196
00:50:38,901 --> 00:50:40,250
they get along,
they cooperate,

1197
00:50:40,251 --> 00:50:43,550
all this sort of stuff.
And then resources get scarce,

1198
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:45,650
right?
There's some change in the environment.

1199
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:50,090
Suddenly there's not as much food around
and as people start to get hungry,

1200
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:54,230
one of the tribes goes off and for in 
the course of half an hour,

1201
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:55,123
they tell each other,
made up stories that get increasingly 

1202
00:50:56,811 --> 00:51:00,410
fantastic and by the end of the half an 
hour they have convinced themselves that

1203
00:51:00,411 --> 00:51:03,740
the other tribe are vermin that they 
need to be exterminated,

1204
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:04,633
that they are a scourge on the land,
that they're not really human and they 

1205
00:51:07,011 --> 00:51:08,450
go and wipe them the fuck out.

1206
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:10,213
And that is one of the dangerous 
potentials in human psychology is the 

1207
00:51:12,891 --> 00:51:15,890
fact that when resources get scared 
scarce,

1208
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:18,920
we like identify some sort of threat in 
the environment,

1209
00:51:18,921 --> 00:51:20,600
some sort of group of humans and we go 
home,

1210
00:51:20,601 --> 00:51:22,790
we wipe them the fuck out.
So if you look at,

1211
00:51:22,791 --> 00:51:25,580
for example,
what happened in Germany in 1933,

1212
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:27,260
right?
There's the great depression,

1213
00:51:27,261 --> 00:51:28,094
there's hyperinflation,
there are all these problems and you 

1214
00:51:30,231 --> 00:51:31,064
know,
that old psychology that hasn't changed 

1215
00:51:33,261 --> 00:51:35,600
and tens of thousands of years is still 
there.

1216
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:36,613
And so naturally people start looking 
around for a scapegoat and the 

1217
00:51:39,051 --> 00:51:41,660
antisemitism that is sort of already 
lingering in.

1218
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:44,090
You know,
the German cultural environment,

1219
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,133
you know,
suddenly that becomes the target group 

1220
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:47,530
and you know,
Hitler,

1221
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:49,520
the political opportunist comes along 
and says,

1222
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:51,650
oh,
you can blame it on them.

1223
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:52,753
That's the source of all your problems.
It's almost like there's a death mode 

1224
00:51:55,221 --> 00:51:58,340
locked in the human consciousness that 
when things get scared and like,

1225
00:51:58,341 --> 00:51:59,390
Oh,
you might die,

1226
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:00,950
we're now on death mode.

1227
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:01,813
That's right.
Death mode means you kill other people 

1228
00:52:03,111 --> 00:52:03,980
quickly.
That's right.

1229
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:04,970
And,
and that's,

1230
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,710
and you have to understand,
I mean,

1231
00:52:06,711 --> 00:52:11,660
this is the brutal reality of evolution,
is that in that hunter gatherer context,

1232
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,810
that's fucking useful.
It's really useful if,

1233
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,870
if resources get scarce,
to be the one who acts first,

1234
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:18,913
who wipes out the other tribe first.
What's interesting that we even think 

1235
00:52:22,101 --> 00:52:25,220
that this is unusual or bizarre when we 
look at nature,

1236
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,980
when you look at all the different 
systems in nature that are set up,

1237
00:52:27,981 --> 00:52:32,981
like how many times lions will kill cubs
to make sure that those males don't grow

1238
00:52:34,161 --> 00:52:35,270
up to dominate.
That's right.

1239
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,870
Especially cubs that aren't theirs.
Um,

1240
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:38,901
and that's,
I mean,

1241
00:52:38,901 --> 00:52:39,734
that's a big problem of sort of what's 
happening on college campuses is that 

1242
00:52:42,171 --> 00:52:43,004
there are a lot of unpleasant things in 
human psychology and unpleasant things 

1243
00:52:45,741 --> 00:52:49,460
in human nature and you know,
for humanity,

1244
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:52,400
really the good things come from being 
realistic.

1245
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,800
When we're realistic about how disease 
works,

1246
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,650
we get to control it.
When we're realistic about how electrons

1247
00:52:57,651 --> 00:52:58,730
work,
we get to control them.

1248
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:01,280
Let me ask you this,
because this is really important to this

1249
00:53:01,281 --> 00:53:05,840
subject,
this issue with Marxism spreading across

1250
00:53:05,841 --> 00:53:08,840
universities.
What do you think is the cause of that?

1251
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:10,820
Like why is that so attractive to 
people?

1252
00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:14,060
Why are people so confident to openly 
proclaim,

1253
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,110
proclaim themselves as Marxists without 
understanding how ridiculous that is?

1254
00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:19,070
Well,
it's,

1255
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:20,480
you know,
so John Height,

1256
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:21,970
who um,
you know,

1257
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,230
is uh,
is at Nyu,

1258
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:25,093
he has what's called moral foundations 
theory and essentially it's that we 

1259
00:53:28,441 --> 00:53:32,100
have,
we all have these sort of basic impulses

1260
00:53:32,101 --> 00:53:33,330
of morality.
So for example,

1261
00:53:33,331 --> 00:53:34,440
fairness,
right?

1262
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:35,573
So you know,
you can watch little kids and they're 

1263
00:53:36,601 --> 00:53:38,550
like our tracking fairness,
what's fair,

1264
00:53:38,551 --> 00:53:39,384
who got more,
who got to play with the toy more and 

1265
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:41,634
all that sort of stuff.

1266
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,140
That doesn't change,
right?

1267
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:44,213
But we have these notions of fairness 
play out in different ways as we're 

1268
00:53:46,531 --> 00:53:47,364
adults,
but different political groups and 

1269
00:53:50,161 --> 00:53:50,994
different tribes favor these other 
notions of fairness more than some 

1270
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:56,040
others.
So let's take for example,

1271
00:53:56,041 --> 00:53:58,740
the issue of pro life versus pro choice.
Right?

1272
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:00,840
Okay.
So you have,

1273
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,100
let's just,
here's the question.

1274
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:04,980
Are liberals pro life or are liberals 
pro choice?

1275
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:08,940
They're more pro choice on the issue of 
abortion.

1276
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:13,110
So on abortion it's about freedom,
right?

1277
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:14,320
Okay.
Uh,

1278
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:16,170
well it's very much about women's 
rights,

1279
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:17,850
women's freedom.
It's a big,

1280
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:18,820
uh,
it's not,

1281
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:21,870
it's not even thought of it like as a 
human freedom because,

1282
00:54:21,871 --> 00:54:22,660
uh,
it's,

1283
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:24,510
it's about the woman,
not about the child.

1284
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:27,000
That's right.
So it's about the woman's freedom,

1285
00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:27,943
right?
So they've hooked up to that idea of 

1286
00:54:28,831 --> 00:54:29,730
freedom,
right?

1287
00:54:29,731 --> 00:54:30,720
Yes.
And then,

1288
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:32,670
you know,
conservatives are pro life.

1289
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:35,700
This is about caring and protecting from
harm and all that sort of stuff.

1290
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,350
Okay.
Unless you're talking about war,

1291
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:40,410
unless you're talking about war and 
that's exactly the point.

1292
00:54:40,411 --> 00:54:41,244
Is this that you know,
are all humans hypocrites or is it that 

1293
00:54:44,011 --> 00:54:48,810
we selectively use these same intuitions
that we all have for different causes?

1294
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,160
So if you look at,
for example,

1295
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:52,590
gun control,
are liberals pro choice or pro life?

1296
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:55,590
They're definitely pro life.
Ah Ha.

1297
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:56,693
So what you see is that on abortion 
they're pro choice and on gun control 

1298
00:54:59,851 --> 00:55:02,190
they're pro life,
but then when it comes the other way,

1299
00:55:02,191 --> 00:55:07,191
exactly lichens are pro choice when it 
comes to guns.

1300
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:08,933
So we all have these same intuitions,
but we use them in different ways to 

1301
00:55:12,301 --> 00:55:14,130
justify our political arguments.
Well,

1302
00:55:14,131 --> 00:55:14,964
what's interesting too is that there's 
two positions that are taking place in 

1303
00:55:17,490 --> 00:55:21,630
the American psyche at least,
that were almost reluctantly agreeing to

1304
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:26,840
and is that the Republicans are,
or the Conservatives are more realistic,

1305
00:55:27,601 --> 00:55:32,220
more hardcore ready to kick ass ready to
fight for what's right.

1306
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:33,093
Yeah.
Whereas liberals are bunch of whiny 

1307
00:55:34,681 --> 00:55:35,514
crybabies looking to give away their 
money and they're creating welfare 

1308
00:55:37,951 --> 00:55:38,701
babies.
Well,

1309
00:55:38,701 --> 00:55:40,610
that's certainly.
If it wasn't for.

1310
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:41,513
If it wasn't for the conservatives,
these fucking people would be speaking 

1311
00:55:44,101 --> 00:55:48,090
German living in Vietnam actually write 
well at all tribes.

1312
00:55:48,091 --> 00:55:50,520
The nature of tribes.
You tell something that makes your tribe

1313
00:55:50,521 --> 00:55:52,280
look like the good guys.
Right?

1314
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,950
So each tribe has.
That's,

1315
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:57,150
that's the conservative story.
And then the liberal story is like we're

1316
00:55:57,151 --> 00:56:00,810
fighting racism and sexism because you 
see the Golden Globes.

1317
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:02,010
Uh,
I did see the golden.

1318
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:04,780
She's a meryl streep,
Meryl Streep's speech.

1319
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:06,850
God bless her.
God bless marrow.

1320
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:10,080
What she was talking about,
mixed martial arts people get so mad.

1321
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:12,940
And I was like,
of course she doesn't watch cage fighter

1322
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:15,540
when she's talking out of her ass for 
sure.

1323
00:56:15,541 --> 00:56:18,720
But she did say that some people aren't 
artists.

1324
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:19,583
Martial artists aren't artists.
Well that's completely open to 

1325
00:56:22,321 --> 00:56:24,010
interpretation.
Like what do you think is

1326
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:26,380
beautiful?
You think that fucking stupid movie.

1327
00:56:26,381 --> 00:56:28,990
When you played that Rockstar,
what was that one that nobody went to?

1328
00:56:28,991 --> 00:56:31,600
St Ricky get your gun or whatever the 
fuck that is.

1329
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:32,950
Listen,
that wasn't art.

1330
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:33,993
That was an art.
And Anderson Silva Front kick to the 

1331
00:56:35,831 --> 00:56:36,664
face is a thousand times more beautiful 
than that piece of shit movie put out 

1332
00:56:39,461 --> 00:56:40,294
lady.
I'm sure she's a very nice person and 

1333
00:56:43,351 --> 00:56:46,990
she probably thinks that she's.
She's standing up for what's right.

1334
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:50,140
Get ready for ricky.
That's ricky flash.

1335
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,153
Get the fuck out of here.
Three people saw that when we are all 

1336
00:56:53,111 --> 00:56:57,400
related to her.
He saw that movie and you see that movie

1337
00:56:57,450 --> 00:56:58,600
even heard of it.
It was like,

1338
00:56:58,870 --> 00:57:00,810
what are they doing?
She's an 80 year old lady,

1339
00:57:00,811 --> 00:57:02,860
is going to be a rockstar.
Ricky's coming back.

1340
00:57:02,861 --> 00:57:03,694
And.
But it's also like such weird casting 

1341
00:57:04,961 --> 00:57:08,080
for her too because she does like these 
emotionally difficult.

1342
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:08,913
Like Sophie's choice movies.
She's like trying to do like a poppy 

1343
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:13,470
rockstar movie.
Well she was interested in it.

1344
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,670
You know,
she's an amazing actress.

1345
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:19,770
She's an amazing artist in her realm.
And I just think it's the.

1346
00:57:19,771 --> 00:57:20,604
You could,
you could sort of say that without 

1347
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:23,373
disparaging what other people enjoy and 
including disparaging with a lot of 

1348
00:57:27,401 --> 00:57:29,350
women.
Enjoy like and foreigners.

1349
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:30,303
One of the things you were saying is 
that Hollywood is crawling with 

1350
00:57:32,201 --> 00:57:33,670
foreigners.
If you take them out,

1351
00:57:33,671 --> 00:57:36,970
all you have left is mma and football,
MMA,

1352
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,440
mixed martial arts,
not the arts,

1353
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:39,693
but you wouldn't.
That's not true because like 80 percent 

1354
00:57:41,801 --> 00:57:43,960
of the fighters in the UFC or from other
countries,

1355
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:46,690
they're from Ireland,
like conor Mcgregor,

1356
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:48,880
they're from Brazil.
Like Amanda Nunez.

1357
00:57:48,881 --> 00:57:52,510
I mean this is the good,
incredibly diverse lineup of people from

1358
00:57:52,511 --> 00:57:55,810
all over the world.
So for her to say that is like so silly,

1359
00:57:56,170 --> 00:57:57,003
but I can understand saying that you 
don't think it's an art by your 

1360
00:57:59,081 --> 00:57:59,920
interpretation.

1361
00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:01,263
I understand that,
but the larger point is that humans are 

1362
00:58:03,221 --> 00:58:04,310
silly.
Yes,

1363
00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:08,260
general are silly and we're not 
individually that smart.

1364
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:11,680
I think performance arts,
like as far as dance,

1365
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:14,170
I mean dance is clearly an art,
right?

1366
00:58:14,171 --> 00:58:15,004
If you watch Mikhail Baryshnikov,
that's clearly art and I think in many 

1367
00:58:18,401 --> 00:58:23,401
ways competition in performance,
like gymnastics is also an art.

1368
00:58:23,590 --> 00:58:25,630
We don't think of it as an art.
We think of it as a sport,

1369
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:30,460
but when you look at the ability to 
execute these spectacular moves,

1370
00:58:30,461 --> 00:58:33,310
yeah,
maybe that doing it to a concerto,

1371
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:35,500
but it's still art.
You know,

1372
00:58:35,501 --> 00:58:40,501
like you see some amazing gymnast,
fly through the air and nail a landing.

1373
00:58:40,631 --> 00:58:42,250
It's beautiful.
It's glorious.

1374
00:58:42,251 --> 00:58:44,140
Well,
that's art in competition,

1375
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:45,273
but it's not one on one competition.
Now art in one on one competition is 

1376
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:51,400
Edson Barboza.
We'll kicking Terry Adam.

1377
00:58:51,610 --> 00:58:53,560
I know it doesn't look like art to some 
people,

1378
00:58:54,310 --> 00:58:55,143
but to me it does well and it's a 
technically extremely difficult move in 

1379
00:58:58,010 --> 00:59:00,990
clinic and a lot of time to practice and
get good at it.

1380
00:59:01,150 --> 00:59:04,810
So it's just the fact that when he does 
his beautiful pair of wet,

1381
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:06,640
it just lands in someone's face.
Well,

1382
00:59:06,641 --> 00:59:11,350
someone has to suffer because someone 
has to suffer and perhaps sometimes both

1383
00:59:11,351 --> 00:59:16,300
people have to suffer in terms of a very
brutal fight.

1384
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:17,223
Right.
But if you look at like Amanda Nunez 

1385
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:21,100
knockout out of Ronda Rousey,
if you're an Amanda Nunez Fan,

1386
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:22,190
that is a beautiful

1387
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:23,023
work of art.
Yeah,

1388
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:26,120
because she didn't get any promotion for
that fight.

1389
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:30,140
She was looked at like cannon fodder to 
go in there and fight rousy.

1390
00:59:30,141 --> 00:59:33,110
A lot of people were predicting a first 
round victory and she went out there and

1391
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:35,760
fucked her up in 48 seconds.
That's art too.

1392
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:39,230
To some people it might not be to her,
but.

1393
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:40,241
Well,
but also,

1394
00:59:40,241 --> 00:59:42,280
I mean this comes down to,
you know,

1395
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:43,420
liberals,
right?

1396
00:59:43,421 --> 00:59:48,370
So in general,
liberals massively over favor the notion

1397
00:59:48,371 --> 00:59:50,920
of caring.
That's like their big,

1398
00:59:50,921 --> 00:59:53,230
big moral intuition,
right?

1399
00:59:53,231 --> 00:59:55,870
So they care about the environment,
right?

1400
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:59,770
They care about protecting children,
toddlers from dangerous guns,

1401
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,030
right?
They just sort of.

1402
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:03,940
Everything is interpreted through caring
and wanting to protect.

1403
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:06,970
So understandably,
when they look at an MMA fight,

1404
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:07,661
they're like,
oh,

1405
01:00:07,661 --> 01:00:10,870
that's bad because there's not caring 
and people are getting hurt,

1406
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:12,190
right?
They're getting their feelings hurt.

1407
01:00:12,430 --> 01:00:13,263
And so when Jordan Peterson is on here 
and he's talking about how it's this 

1408
01:00:15,431 --> 01:00:16,264
very sort of maternal thing,
it is a very maternal thing and the 

1409
01:00:19,451 --> 01:00:20,350
problem is,
is that,

1410
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:21,820
you know,
what ends up happening is,

1411
01:00:21,821 --> 01:00:24,670
is that when you have an echo chamber 
like college campuses,

1412
01:00:24,671 --> 01:00:28,210
which are incredibly liberal with very 
few outside opinions,

1413
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:30,730
that that's the rabbit hole that they go
down,

1414
01:00:30,790 --> 01:00:35,020
they go down the caring rabbit hole and 
when you go down the caring rabbit hole,

1415
01:00:35,021 --> 01:00:35,854
you end up at Marxism and you know,
when you're surrounded by people who 

1416
01:00:38,411 --> 01:00:39,244
essentially think like you,
there's no one to like sit you down and 

1417
01:00:41,291 --> 01:00:43,540
be like,
that's fucking nuts.

1418
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:45,560
Like let's talk about though the,

1419
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:49,560
that is why do you think going down the 
caring rabbit hole lead you to Marxism?

1420
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:51,410
Well,
because you know you don't want anyone's

1421
01:00:51,411 --> 01:00:54,200
feelings to get hurt.
You want everybody to have enough.

1422
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:55,460
You know,
you want to share.

1423
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:58,610
And it's important to realize back to 
your point where you said like,

1424
01:00:58,611 --> 01:00:59,840
you know,
if it was the three of us,

1425
01:00:59,841 --> 01:01:01,490
communism might work,
right?

1426
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:02,713
It comes back to the Dunbar number.
If you actually look at hunter gatherer 

1427
01:01:05,331 --> 01:01:07,790
tribes,
they're communists right there,

1428
01:01:07,791 --> 01:01:09,080
really,
really socialist.

1429
01:01:09,410 --> 01:01:11,180
And what they do is,
for example,

1430
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:13,220
they have these behaviors where,
for example,

1431
01:01:13,221 --> 01:01:15,290
they'll drag.
If you go and kill a deer,

1432
01:01:15,470 --> 01:01:16,303
we drag it into the middle of the 
village so everybody can see the deer 

1433
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:20,113
and then we divided up and then you make
sure that you give it to everybody else 

1434
01:01:23,121 --> 01:01:25,910
first.
And then you take the last piece and you

1435
01:01:25,911 --> 01:01:27,800
take the smallest piece.
So it's,

1436
01:01:27,801 --> 01:01:29,240
you know,
what you do with birthday cake,

1437
01:01:29,241 --> 01:01:33,170
you're trying to show everybody like I'm
being Super Sherry here.

1438
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:36,470
Isn't this great?
I'm not thinking about myself and at the

1439
01:01:36,471 --> 01:01:37,304
level of a tribe,
you and I can track all of the 

1440
01:01:39,981 --> 01:01:43,160
interactions we can attract.
We can track the fact that,

1441
01:01:43,430 --> 01:01:44,270
you know,
oh,

1442
01:01:44,330 --> 01:01:47,330
you know,
a fucking hung over there is not pulling

1443
01:01:47,331 --> 01:01:49,030
his weight.
Such a,

1444
01:01:49,610 --> 01:01:50,443
such a piece of shit.
And that's the point we go and we talk 

1445
01:01:52,791 --> 01:01:53,271
about,
um,

1446
01:01:53,271 --> 01:01:56,390
we talk shit about 'em.
And then we go and we go and we confront

1447
01:01:56,650 --> 01:01:58,970
them.
We say among you fucking piece of shit.

1448
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:02,690
Like we go out all hunting all day and 
then you sit around and you know,

1449
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:06,170
there's always going to be an honest.
There is always going to be an along and

1450
01:02:06,171 --> 01:02:08,990
if you have enough people for sure 
you're going to have 100 people.

1451
01:02:08,991 --> 01:02:11,030
There's going to be one and that's just 
evolution.

1452
01:02:11,031 --> 01:02:14,680
It's a strategy that works.
Oh,

1453
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:16,370
fat sack of Shit.

1454
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:19,800
You come back and all guava,

1455
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:23,870
like you ate all of it.
Right.

1456
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,920
And there's.
Then you have to plot to kill ung.

1457
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:27,083
Well.
Or to get him to pull his weight for 

1458
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:29,041
him.
No,

1459
01:02:29,041 --> 01:02:30,760
you just say kill him.
Take them on.

1460
01:02:31,190 --> 01:02:33,060
Take them hunting and have him have an 
accident.

1461
01:02:33,061 --> 01:02:34,790
Come over the fucking place.
Exactly.

1462
01:02:34,830 --> 01:02:37,640
Look over there dude.
Looking at waterfall or get them to hang

1463
01:02:37,641 --> 01:02:39,300
out with a toddler with a gun.
Yeah.

1464
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:41,310
They don't have that as though the 
second word.

1465
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:45,960
Tyler with little kids can't even 
stretch that far.

1466
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:49,680
Talking to now you have a zero worry 
about being shot by a bone marrow from a

1467
01:02:49,681 --> 01:02:53,310
toddler.
Another reason why arrows are superior.

1468
01:02:55,050 --> 01:02:56,550
I'm so.
I'm so,

1469
01:02:56,551 --> 01:02:57,384
but Marxism,
Marxism being like a communist ideology 

1470
01:03:01,291 --> 01:03:03,630
of Marxism,
being that you know,

1471
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:07,350
everyone should be more equal sharing 
more,

1472
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:08,333
but as Jordan Peterson pointed out so 
eloquently on your podcast and on my 

1473
01:03:11,191 --> 01:03:13,260
podcast,
that doesn't really work.

1474
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:16,760
It doesn't work at 7 billion people,
more 300 million people,

1475
01:03:17,050 --> 01:03:17,883
50.
It works at 50 or $150 because that's 

1476
01:03:20,131 --> 01:03:23,970
what our brain can track.
The problem is is that I can't track all

1477
01:03:23,971 --> 01:03:26,520
the ungs.
It works great without technology.

1478
01:03:26,910 --> 01:03:29,250
It works great without access to people 
all over the world.

1479
01:03:29,251 --> 01:03:31,800
That works great in a consolidated 
environment,

1480
01:03:31,810 --> 01:03:33,930
a small controlled,
contained environment,

1481
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:37,200
but it doesn't work when a,
essentially there's,

1482
01:03:37,201 --> 01:03:38,490
you know,
you're in an apartment building,

1483
01:03:38,491 --> 01:03:40,710
have 2000 people and you don't want to 
fucking talk to anybody,

1484
01:03:41,010 --> 01:03:42,240
right?
But what do people say?

1485
01:03:42,241 --> 01:03:44,610
Well,
it should work and we can make it work.

1486
01:03:44,611 --> 01:03:48,510
It's just this old outdated mindset that
you fuckers grew up.

1487
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:52,290
You guys grew up way back in the day 
before the influence of the Internet.

1488
01:03:52,330 --> 01:03:53,163
Now we understand thatZ is a very 
respectable pronoun and we need to be 

1489
01:03:56,830 --> 01:03:58,620
using.
How do you say that?

1490
01:03:58,621 --> 01:03:59,520
Zero.
Zero,

1491
01:03:59,550 --> 01:04:03,090
zero.
I think so know there's 75 options.

1492
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:04,890
Whatever the fuck they are,
you know.

1493
01:04:06,350 --> 01:04:08,850
Well,
I mean I think the experts making people

1494
01:04:08,851 --> 01:04:09,870
use it.
Well,

1495
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:12,030
Oxford is again also gone down the 
rabbit hole,

1496
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:12,751
but the,
these,

1497
01:04:12,751 --> 01:04:13,584
you know,
colleges and academia are not going to 

1498
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:18,380
go back out of the rabbit hole.
They're just getting.

1499
01:04:18,430 --> 01:04:19,263
They're going to keep going down the 
rabbit hole until the larger community 

1500
01:04:21,811 --> 01:04:25,440
holds them accountable.
So do you think that that's happening at

1501
01:04:25,441 --> 01:04:26,274
all now?
I mean there was the president of 

1502
01:04:27,091 --> 01:04:28,860
Chicago University that said,
hey listen,

1503
01:04:28,861 --> 01:04:30,660
there's going to be a safe space is this
year.

1504
01:04:30,990 --> 01:04:31,823
It's not going to be any trigger 
warnings to shut the fuck up and go to 

1505
01:04:33,811 --> 01:04:36,390
work and learn.
This is the marketplace of ideas.

1506
01:04:36,391 --> 01:04:38,130
That's right.
Express yourself,

1507
01:04:38,190 --> 01:04:41,490
get your ideas challenged,
debate these ideas.

1508
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:44,220
Let's find out what's right rather than 
what's safe.

1509
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,233
Well,
and I think a large part of how you do 

1510
01:04:46,411 --> 01:04:47,490
that faster.

1511
01:04:47,490 --> 01:04:49,530
I mean firstly people already doing it.
There's the,

1512
01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:51,900
there's the guy in Chicago,
there's Jordan Peterson,

1513
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:53,023
you know,
the larger community is having a 

1514
01:04:53,731 --> 01:04:54,564
conversation about this,
but the faster way to do this is 

1515
01:04:56,521 --> 01:04:57,540
science,
right?

1516
01:04:57,541 --> 01:04:58,374
You confront people with science and 
then you force people to either are you 

1517
01:05:01,531 --> 01:05:02,364
either accepting reality,
are you denying reality and if you're 

1518
01:05:05,221 --> 01:05:06,054
denying reality,
then you got a real problem because now 

1519
01:05:08,551 --> 01:05:09,750
you look like a fool.
Well,

1520
01:05:09,751 --> 01:05:11,310
you,
when you talk about science,

1521
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:12,203
you have,
you run into a real issue when it comes 

1522
01:05:13,651 --> 01:05:14,640
to gender.
Yeah.

1523
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:18,160
Gender and science,
like gender as is discussed

1524
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:19,293
on campuses today,
things that gets things get real weird 

1525
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:23,133
thing.
It gets real sort of loose and open to 

1526
01:05:25,331 --> 01:05:28,450
interpretation and even though you're 
biologically a male,

1527
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:32,650
you can identify as a woman and the 
correct way to treat you as to treat you

1528
01:05:32,651 --> 01:05:33,950
as a woman.
So we're,

1529
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:36,160
we're gone.
We're outside the realm of science now.

1530
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:37,013
Well,
we're in into the world of social 

1531
01:05:38,201 --> 01:05:40,270
constructs and agreed upon behavior,

1532
01:05:40,450 --> 01:05:44,500
but the science exists.
It's just in journals and it hasn't been

1533
01:05:44,501 --> 01:05:45,334
brought and made accessible to these 
children and there are ways to do it 

1534
01:05:47,441 --> 01:05:48,700
very simply.
So for example,

1535
01:05:48,701 --> 01:05:50,980
do you know the story of David Reimer?
No.

1536
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:53,410
Okay.
So this was a kid in the sixties,

1537
01:05:53,660 --> 01:05:57,700
um,
who I think it was Canadian and for some

1538
01:05:57,701 --> 01:05:58,534
bizarre reason right at the hospital,
the surgeon decides to use an 

1539
01:06:02,231 --> 01:06:03,064
electrocautery needle to circumcise him 
and basically there's a huge botch up 

1540
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:11,140
and he manages to,
he manages to chop off most of his dick.

1541
01:06:11,350 --> 01:06:14,800
Right.
And so the parents are like,

1542
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:17,110
okay,
can't put that back on,

1543
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:17,973
what do we do?
And so they end up going to the world's 

1544
01:06:21,641 --> 01:06:24,370
leading specialist in the 19 sixties or 
whatever it was,

1545
01:06:24,371 --> 01:06:28,180
50 sixties on gender identity and all 
this stuff,

1546
01:06:28,181 --> 01:06:29,680
which is this guy Dr.
money.

1547
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:30,813
And they go and see Dr Munday and Dr Dr.
money convinces them to castrate their 

1548
01:06:39,461 --> 01:06:42,730
penis lists son and to raise him as a 
girl.

1549
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:46,040
And so they have to go and,
you know,

1550
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,370
take their son in and,
you know,

1551
01:06:48,490 --> 01:06:50,740
David who is now going to be raised as 
Brenda,

1552
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:51,980
um,
is,

1553
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:52,813
you know,
Dr Money is showing pictures of naked 

1554
01:06:55,481 --> 01:06:56,314
men to Brenda and saying like,
this is what girls like and all this 

1555
01:07:00,401 --> 01:07:03,070
sort of stuff and you know,
uh,

1556
01:07:03,071 --> 01:07:03,904
is forcing him to wear women's clothing 
and they're going to do hormone therapy 

1557
01:07:06,881 --> 01:07:07,714
and all this sort of stuff.
Now Dr Money is meanwhile publishing 

1558
01:07:10,421 --> 01:07:11,920
papers that is saying,
oh,

1559
01:07:11,921 --> 01:07:14,020
this is a tremendous success.
It's amazing.

1560
01:07:14,021 --> 01:07:16,480
Like gender is all a construct,
you know,

1561
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:17,801
blah,
blah,

1562
01:07:17,801 --> 01:07:18,461
blah,
blah,

1563
01:07:18,461 --> 01:07:20,950
you know,
perfectly adjusting to life as a girl.

1564
01:07:20,951 --> 01:07:22,440
All this stuff.
And the plan is,

1565
01:07:22,441 --> 01:07:22,961
is that,
you know,

1566
01:07:22,961 --> 01:07:26,470
they're going to do surgery and give him
a vagina and all this sort of stuff.

1567
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:27,760
Not some.
Now.

1568
01:07:27,761 --> 01:07:30,170
Meanwhile,
what is Brenda doing?

1569
01:07:30,430 --> 01:07:31,263
Brenda's hitting things with sticks.
Brenda has no interest in playing with 

1570
01:07:34,811 --> 01:07:35,644
her sewing machine except for the one 
time that she takes a screwdriver and 

1571
01:07:38,681 --> 01:07:39,514
picks it apart to figure out how it 
works and doesn't want to hang out with 

1572
01:07:42,731 --> 01:07:43,564
girls.
Only wants to hang out with boys only 

1573
01:07:45,041 --> 01:07:47,200
wants to play with her brothers toys,
you know,

1574
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:49,540
so all these sorts of things.
And at some point,

1575
01:07:49,570 --> 01:07:51,310
you know,
and when the kid is like 13,

1576
01:07:51,311 --> 01:07:52,510
14,
the Jig is up,

1577
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:53,403
they figure out that they better tell 
Brenda the truth and Brenda finds out 

1578
01:07:57,221 --> 01:08:01,030
the truth and proceeds to essentially,
you know,

1579
01:08:01,031 --> 01:08:06,031
have a mastectomy to remove her breasts,
switches to male hormones and you know,

1580
01:08:06,701 --> 01:08:10,470
instantly goes to living as a boy.
Now what happens is,

1581
01:08:10,471 --> 01:08:11,304
is that,
you know,

1582
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:14,460
Brenda,
now David grows up,

1583
01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:16,820
marries woman,
um,

1584
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:18,740
and you know,
has a relationship,

1585
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:24,040
but unsurprisingly has a whole bunch of 
psychological issues and ultimately goes

1586
01:08:24,261 --> 01:08:25,094
into a supermarket,
a grow a parking lot and blows his 

1587
01:08:27,801 --> 01:08:28,634
brains out.

1588
01:08:30,770 --> 01:08:32,270
Now,
the point is,

1589
01:08:32,271 --> 01:08:34,820
is that I think that if you really want 
to talk about gender,

1590
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:39,110
you should force anybody who wants to 
deny gender to talk about David Reimer.

1591
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:40,243
You Make David Reimer household name,
and we're all going to talk about what 

1592
01:08:43,071 --> 01:08:45,830
lessons can we learn from the tragedy of
j Dot David Reimer.

1593
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:47,720
And if you get,
for example,

1594
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:48,583
you know,
how many listeners do you have at this 

1595
01:08:49,311 --> 01:08:51,110
point?
Yeah,

1596
01:08:51,111 --> 01:08:51,944
it's a lot Joe.
And if you get your tens of millions of 

1597
01:08:54,711 --> 01:08:55,431
listeners,
$30,

1598
01:08:55,431 --> 01:08:59,150
million plus listeners talking about 
David Reimer and you're like,

1599
01:08:59,151 --> 01:09:01,310
we're going to make David Reimer 
household name.

1600
01:09:01,610 --> 01:09:02,443
We're going to make sure that the 
tragedy of David Reimer is something 

1601
01:09:04,431 --> 01:09:05,264
that everybody knows about and learns 
about and everybody's tweeting and 

1602
01:09:08,091 --> 01:09:08,924
talking about David Reimer.
Then suddenly it becomes very hard for 

1603
01:09:12,561 --> 01:09:15,500
anybody to say that gender is purely a 
construct.

1604
01:09:15,770 --> 01:09:18,200
There may be spectrums and there may be 
like,

1605
01:09:18,230 --> 01:09:20,270
you know,
weird in between areas,

1606
01:09:20,510 --> 01:09:24,020
but the reality is that a lot of gender 
is genetic and the sciences there,

1607
01:09:24,170 --> 01:09:25,003
and you're not going to get a bunch of 
social justice warriors to read science 

1608
01:09:26,781 --> 01:09:28,400
because most people don't actually read 
science,

1609
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:31,970
but you will get them to engage with the
story of David Slash Brenda Reimer.

1610
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:33,100
Well,

1611
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:33,933
there's most certainly as a spectrum,
but there's also a high percentage of 

1612
01:09:37,811 --> 01:09:38,644
people that operate in a very specific 
area of that spectrum and you're going 

1613
01:09:42,431 --> 01:09:45,280
to get some kids that are convinced that
they are boys,

1614
01:09:45,540 --> 01:09:46,373
but guess what?
Some of those kids grow up and they 

1615
01:09:47,441 --> 01:09:48,274
changed their mind as they get older and
that's something that really deserves 

1616
01:09:51,461 --> 01:09:52,294
the shit out of me.
When I see nine year olds that are on 

1617
01:09:53,231 --> 01:09:54,540
hormones,
I'm like,

1618
01:09:54,550 --> 01:09:57,250
this seems crazy.
Like this kid really thinks he's a girl.

1619
01:09:57,251 --> 01:09:59,710
Let him think he's a girl.
Like as is like,

1620
01:09:59,711 --> 01:10:01,740
why are you adding hormones to the mix?
Why?

1621
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:02,613
Right.
Why are you suggesting surgery when he 

1622
01:10:04,241 --> 01:10:05,074
turns 15 or whatever the fuck the ages.
Like this seems like something that 

1623
01:10:07,601 --> 01:10:12,601
should be worked out by a grown adult 
with a fully developed frontal cortex.

1624
01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:14,490
That's right.
It doesn't see.

1625
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:18,610
And also like the influence of the 
parents to change how this kid.

1626
01:10:18,611 --> 01:10:22,240
Like if you have a kid and you have a 
daughter and your daughter just wants to

1627
01:10:22,241 --> 01:10:25,930
cut all her hair off and climb trees and
like let her do that.

1628
01:10:26,170 --> 01:10:27,003
Like if she wants to be a boy letter,
thinks she's a boy and and work it all 

1629
01:10:30,131 --> 01:10:31,390
out one day.
That's right.

1630
01:10:31,450 --> 01:10:32,283
But to work it all out and to encourage 
that behavior or to say we're going to 

1631
01:10:35,771 --> 01:10:36,604
bring you to a transgender specialist 
right away and they're going to 

1632
01:10:38,831 --> 01:10:39,664
prescribe this and that.
Like how many of these people are going 

1633
01:10:41,711 --> 01:10:45,190
to be like Brenda reimers original 
doctor?

1634
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:48,280
Well there was a male name was a male 
named David,

1635
01:10:48,281 --> 01:10:50,890
David Reimer,
David Reimer's original doctor who,

1636
01:10:51,370 --> 01:10:52,203
who were,
you know,

1637
01:10:52,570 --> 01:10:55,270
proclaiming it was such a success when 
the tour shit

1638
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:56,990
in general,
raw reality,

1639
01:10:56,991 --> 01:10:58,930
denial leads to tragedy.
That's,

1640
01:10:59,060 --> 01:10:59,893
and you know,
so what we have to be engaged with is 

1641
01:11:01,191 --> 01:11:02,024
what is reality and you know,
it's not that I sit here and have read 

1642
01:11:04,850 --> 01:11:07,130
literally all of the science I can't 
like,

1643
01:11:07,131 --> 01:11:09,500
it's,
it's far too vast to project and science

1644
01:11:09,501 --> 01:11:11,270
isn't supposed to be an individual 
project.

1645
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:12,343
Supposed to be a collective project.
We're all trying to really figure out 

1646
01:11:14,701 --> 01:11:15,534
what is this bitch known as reality that
has evaded us for millions of years or 

1647
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:21,300
tens,
hundreds of thousands of years.

1648
01:11:21,690 --> 01:11:23,660
And you know,
the,

1649
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:24,533
the point is,
is that if you want to talk about like 

1650
01:11:26,070 --> 01:11:26,903
gender for example,
let's talk about people who are 

1651
01:11:28,561 --> 01:11:29,394
Intersex.
There are some people who are born and 

1652
01:11:32,161 --> 01:11:33,060
it's not,
you know,

1653
01:11:33,061 --> 01:11:37,800
their genitalia at birth aren't clearly 
male or female and what they now do,

1654
01:11:37,801 --> 01:11:38,634
you know,
the medical community is that you 

1655
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:42,030
basically find out what are they 
genetically,

1656
01:11:42,031 --> 01:11:42,781
are they x,
y,

1657
01:11:42,781 --> 01:11:43,860
or are they xx?

1658
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:44,933
And then you raise them as that,
but you don't do hormones and you don't 

1659
01:11:48,181 --> 01:11:51,810
do surgery precisely because you're 
going to let them decide.

1660
01:11:51,990 --> 01:11:53,400
Right?
And if you are,

1661
01:11:53,430 --> 01:11:55,200
I mean,
you know how much better.

1662
01:11:55,410 --> 01:11:56,243
Okay,
so why is this surgeon using an 

1663
01:11:57,521 --> 01:11:59,670
electrocautery,
neil needle to do circumcision?

1664
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:01,440
Who the fuck knows,
right?

1665
01:12:01,441 --> 01:12:04,620
Like it's a dumb choice by a surgeon.
But imagine if they'd said,

1666
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:06,720
okay,
that fuck up happened.

1667
01:12:06,721 --> 01:12:10,200
We can't unfuck that up,
but we're not going to now make it worse

1668
01:12:10,201 --> 01:12:12,120
by chopping off his balls.
Well,

1669
01:12:12,121 --> 01:12:14,250
this was what year?
This is in the sixties,

1670
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,240
fifties,
sixties.

1671
01:12:15,690 --> 01:12:19,290
The amount of data they had back then 
was so limited and we've now,

1672
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:21,360
we've now got a lot more data and you 
know,

1673
01:12:21,510 --> 01:12:22,343
David,
Brenda Reimer is not an isolated 

1674
01:12:23,881 --> 01:12:26,010
incident.
There've been other incidents like that.

1675
01:12:26,390 --> 01:12:27,450
Um,
and you know,

1676
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:28,830
they,
they very like,

1677
01:12:28,831 --> 01:12:29,664
it's not,
it's not that everything turns out 

1678
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:32,790
David,
Brenda Reimer,

1679
01:12:32,910 --> 01:12:33,743
right?

1680
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:37,830
But if you really care about children 
and you really care about people,

1681
01:12:37,890 --> 01:12:40,050
which is the sort of the big liberal 
value,

1682
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:42,690
then you know,
if the hippocratic oath,

1683
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:43,553
the whole point of being a doctor is 
their first responsibility is do no 

1684
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:46,710
harm,
right?

1685
01:12:46,711 --> 01:12:48,390
You're not supposed to make things 
worse,

1686
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:50,820
right?
If you can make things better without,

1687
01:12:50,821 --> 01:12:53,130
you know,
really possibly making things worse,

1688
01:12:53,370 --> 01:12:55,770
then that's great.
And so again,

1689
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:56,633
again,
you would,

1690
01:12:56,690 --> 01:13:00,480
we don't let children vote.
We don't let children drive.

1691
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:05,700
Why would we let them make such a huge 
decision at such a young age?

1692
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:06,923
Um,
and I think whatever the decision ends 

1693
01:13:09,001 --> 01:13:09,691
up being,
you know,

1694
01:13:09,691 --> 01:13:12,030
people are going to make their own 
individual decisions,

1695
01:13:12,031 --> 01:13:12,864
so be it.
But you want to make sure that the 

1696
01:13:14,101 --> 01:13:15,660
decision is an informed decision.
And

1697
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:17,060
there's also,
um,

1698
01:13:17,450 --> 01:13:18,283
there's forbidden territory when it 
comes to gender and gender identity as 

1699
01:13:21,831 --> 01:13:24,770
far as like what you are allowed to 
debate or not allowed to debate.

1700
01:13:25,730 --> 01:13:26,563
There's a lot of forbidden territory.
It becomes a pretty obvious that the 

1701
01:13:31,101 --> 01:13:31,934
origin of that forbidden behavior,
forbidden thinking is that people that 

1702
01:13:36,951 --> 01:13:37,784
are transgender or gay or marginalized 
in any way have been discriminated 

1703
01:13:41,721 --> 01:13:45,770
against and treated poorly.
And we recognize that.

1704
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:46,753
So we are,
we automatically stop any critical 

1705
01:13:49,761 --> 01:13:52,970
thinking when it comes to those people.
Like they can't be crazy.

1706
01:13:53,130 --> 01:13:54,840
They must be,
you know,

1707
01:13:54,870 --> 01:13:55,703
it's just a transgender issue.
It couldn't be that they're crazy and 

1708
01:13:58,371 --> 01:14:00,140
transgender.
Well that's never discussed.

1709
01:14:00,350 --> 01:14:02,420
It can't be.
He's gay and stupid as fuck.

1710
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:02,961
No,
no,

1711
01:14:02,961 --> 01:14:03,141
no,
no,

1712
01:14:03,141 --> 01:14:04,640
no.
Gay People are wonderful.

1713
01:14:04,910 --> 01:14:06,080
They're all amazing.
Yeah.

1714
01:14:06,110 --> 01:14:07,790
Because they've all been discriminated 
against.

1715
01:14:07,850 --> 01:14:09,380
Right.
And the point is you don't,

1716
01:14:09,460 --> 01:14:09,951
I mean,
you know,

1717
01:14:09,951 --> 01:14:11,920
human beings are human.
And so for example,

1718
01:14:11,921 --> 01:14:12,070
when

1719
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:15,280
we had Jordan Peterson on,
one of the questions that I asked him,

1720
01:14:15,370 --> 01:14:17,050
which I think is a super important 
question,

1721
01:14:17,051 --> 01:14:18,850
is Jordan's a psychologist.
Right?

1722
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:20,560
And I asked him,
okay,

1723
01:14:20,561 --> 01:14:23,260
so let's imagine you had a patient who 
came here and said,

1724
01:14:23,261 --> 01:14:24,094
you know,
I want to be called by one of the 70 

1725
01:14:25,361 --> 01:14:26,320
pronouns,
right?

1726
01:14:26,710 --> 01:14:29,680
What as your patient would you then do?
And he said,

1727
01:14:29,980 --> 01:14:30,813
well,
if you came to me and said to me that 

1728
01:14:32,081 --> 01:14:32,914
you were Jesus Christ,
I would have to as a responsible doctor 

1729
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:40,000
first decide that it was in my best 
interest to call you Jesus Christ.

1730
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:44,680
So I have to figure out really what is 
that about and is it going to serve your

1731
01:14:44,681 --> 01:14:48,100
outcome to be able to do that.
And again,

1732
01:14:48,190 --> 01:14:50,860
you know,
there's unaccountability for any human,

1733
01:14:50,861 --> 01:14:51,694
whether it's a celebrity or a sports 
star or a rapper or a gay person or a 

1734
01:14:55,151 --> 01:14:59,860
transgender person or a politician or a 
scientist is bad.

1735
01:14:59,950 --> 01:15:03,040
Like humans need accountability.
Like that's just the reality.

1736
01:15:03,041 --> 01:15:03,874
Otherwise we go fucking nut balls.
So if for any reason a human is denied 

1737
01:15:07,061 --> 01:15:10,060
accountability to other humans,
you've got a problem,

1738
01:15:10,330 --> 01:15:10,690
right?

1739
01:15:10,690 --> 01:15:11,523
Yeah.
You're doing them a disservice by 

1740
01:15:12,581 --> 01:15:16,540
thinking that your in somehow or another
helping them or you know,

1741
01:15:16,541 --> 01:15:19,930
like that stupid article earlier today 
that we were talking about,

1742
01:15:19,931 --> 01:15:20,764
about these people showing up with a 
racist and a conference and then the 

1743
01:15:24,941 --> 01:15:26,980
white people being forced to check their
privilege.

1744
01:15:26,981 --> 01:15:29,980
Like this is your,
you're ruining the whole thing with this

1745
01:15:29,981 --> 01:15:33,370
kind of short sighted shitty thinking.

1746
01:15:33,690 --> 01:15:35,260
I want to really go down the rabbit 
hole.

1747
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:36,340
No,
let's do it.

1748
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,970
Let's do it.
So do you know Thomas Soul?

1749
01:15:39,510 --> 01:15:40,950
I know that name.
Why don't we do that name?

1750
01:15:41,130 --> 01:15:43,890
Thomas soul is a big,
famous conservative.

1751
01:15:43,891 --> 01:15:45,670
He's at Stanford.
Um,

1752
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:47,340
he's at the Hoover Institute,
I think.

1753
01:15:47,341 --> 01:15:48,360
Anyway.
So,

1754
01:15:48,470 --> 01:15:49,950
you know,
within this,

1755
01:15:49,970 --> 01:15:52,170
I mean,
first just to set all this up,

1756
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:54,780
we should set up briefly how does 
culture work,

1757
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:55,733
right?
And the way culture works is that it 

1758
01:15:57,540 --> 01:16:00,480
like genetic evolution.
It works based on blind copying.

1759
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:04,110
So what ends up happening is that you 
are in all of people,

1760
01:16:04,170 --> 01:16:06,690
right?
You look up to people and so you blindly

1761
01:16:06,691 --> 01:16:07,524
copied the things they do and 
specifically you start by blindly 

1762
01:16:10,681 --> 01:16:13,050
copying from the outside.
And then you work in,

1763
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:15,720
so the first thing you do is you see 
someone and you're like,

1764
01:16:15,721 --> 01:16:17,160
oh,
that person's fucking amazing.

1765
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:19,260
That rockstar,
that sports star or whatever,

1766
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:20,273
and you start dressing like them.
You start walking like them and all of 

1767
01:16:22,891 --> 01:16:25,620
that sort of stuff.
Now in a hunter gatherer context,

1768
01:16:25,621 --> 01:16:29,550
that would be somebody who is a hunter 
or a gatherer and you're like,

1769
01:16:29,551 --> 01:16:30,241
man,
you know,

1770
01:16:30,241 --> 01:16:33,120
she finds all the best guavas how does 
she do that?

1771
01:16:33,121 --> 01:16:36,950
And then among fucking eats them.
Yeah.

1772
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:38,190
Um,
and so,

1773
01:16:38,191 --> 01:16:38,850
you know,
you would,

1774
01:16:38,850 --> 01:16:41,910
you would like hang out with her.
You'd sort of Shimmy up to her.

1775
01:16:41,911 --> 01:16:43,770
You'd be seeing what she'd be doing.
She's like,

1776
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:44,591
oh,
okay.

1777
01:16:44,591 --> 01:16:47,280
That she looks for a very particular 
color of guava.

1778
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:51,690
She squeezes them in a certain way and 
over time you learn what she's doing.

1779
01:16:51,691 --> 01:16:54,240
And then ultimately you even learn how 
she's thinking.

1780
01:16:55,050 --> 01:17:00,050
But in a large scale society like ours,
I don't meet Michael Jordan,

1781
01:17:00,570 --> 01:17:02,700
right?
Michael Jordan just becomes this sort of

1782
01:17:02,701 --> 01:17:04,440
distant person that I idolized.

1783
01:17:04,470 --> 01:17:08,670
And so advertisers have figured out how 
to hijack these mechanisms and they know

1784
01:17:08,671 --> 01:17:12,410
if you a burger next to Michael Jordan's
face that I'm like,

1785
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:13,790
oh,
I want to be like Michael Jordan,

1786
01:17:13,910 --> 01:17:16,340
so I'm going to eat a big Mac.
Right?

1787
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:19,460
And little children are dumb and so they
blindly copy that,

1788
01:17:19,461 --> 01:17:21,590
or Oh,
I want to be like James Dean,

1789
01:17:21,620 --> 01:17:22,453
he has a cigarette in his mouth and I 
want to blindly copy that and we don't 

1790
01:17:25,011 --> 01:17:25,844
understand that the burger or the 
cigarette is not actually the key to 

1791
01:17:29,481 --> 01:17:30,314
being as successful or as cool as or as 
good at basketball as Michael Jordan or 

1792
01:17:33,621 --> 01:17:34,940
James Deane.
Right.

1793
01:17:34,941 --> 01:17:37,070
We don't understand that.
That's where that comes from.

1794
01:17:37,071 --> 01:17:40,340
So we have this tendency to blindly copy
anything we can.

1795
01:17:40,850 --> 01:17:41,900
Right.
So it makes sense.

1796
01:17:42,330 --> 01:17:43,450
Yeah.
And in,

1797
01:17:43,470 --> 01:17:45,950
in a mass society,
we never work our way in.

1798
01:17:45,951 --> 01:17:47,960
We never learn the mastery,
right.

1799
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:50,630
We just sort of remained at this sort of
very superficial level.

1800
01:17:51,170 --> 01:17:55,880
So what that means is that we're.
Where did this all start?

1801
01:17:56,540 --> 01:17:57,890
A good question.
Yeah.

1802
01:17:58,070 --> 01:17:59,390
Where were you going with this?
Well,

1803
01:17:59,391 --> 01:18:01,450
we're starting at culture,
how culture works,

1804
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:02,600
how culture works.
Okay,

1805
01:18:02,601 --> 01:18:04,100
so now we're going to talk about black 
people.

1806
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:05,720
Okay?
Jesus Christ.

1807
01:18:05,930 --> 01:18:10,070
So Thomas Thomas,
Thomas Soul is a black guy,

1808
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:11,083
right?
And Thomas Soul has for years and years 

1809
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:15,403
and years being trying to fight racism,
but he's been trying to fight racism by 

1810
01:18:18,621 --> 01:18:21,440
having a conversation about culture,
right?

1811
01:18:21,441 --> 01:18:24,980
And the fact that there are essentially 
two different sort of,

1812
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:25,973
uh,
you know,

1813
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:27,820
we're speaking broadly here,
right?

1814
01:18:27,830 --> 01:18:29,810
But this is for the purposes of 
communication.

1815
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:30,913
Um,
we're going to tell a simple story to 

1816
01:18:31,791 --> 01:18:32,750
start off with,
right?

1817
01:18:32,751 --> 01:18:37,640
So broadly speaking,
he puts two different cultures of people

1818
01:18:37,641 --> 01:18:41,150
with dark skin next to each other,
and one culture is these people from the

1819
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:41,984
West indies.

1820
01:18:42,230 --> 01:18:43,063
And one culture is this group of people 
who grew up in the south with slavery 

1821
01:18:46,131 --> 01:18:47,930
and all that sort of stuff.
Now,

1822
01:18:48,170 --> 01:18:51,260
what one group,
the West indies group does really well.

1823
01:18:51,290 --> 01:18:53,720
So I'll,
a lot of the successful black people,

1824
01:18:53,721 --> 01:18:56,990
people like Colin Powell are originally 
from that cultural heritage.

1825
01:18:57,740 --> 01:18:58,573
The other group is the group that you 
find in ghettos and African American 

1826
01:19:01,761 --> 01:19:03,260
communities.
And all of that sort of stuff,

1827
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:04,640
they don't do well,
right?

1828
01:19:04,641 --> 01:19:07,490
They don't get good education,
they shoot each other,

1829
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:11,060
they're all these sorts of things.
And the reason why soul has been telling

1830
01:19:11,061 --> 01:19:13,250
this story is because he's been trying 
to say,

1831
01:19:13,550 --> 01:19:14,383
you know,
when liberals look at the people in 

1832
01:19:16,071 --> 01:19:17,630
Ghettos,
they say,

1833
01:19:17,780 --> 01:19:19,070
oh,
racism.

1834
01:19:19,190 --> 01:19:22,760
That's why they're not succeeding.
And Soul is saying,

1835
01:19:22,940 --> 01:19:23,840
no,
it's not.

1836
01:19:24,170 --> 01:19:26,600
Because if you look at this group from 
the West indies,

1837
01:19:26,870 --> 01:19:29,120
they also came from the experience of 
slavery.

1838
01:19:29,210 --> 01:19:31,910
There was slavery in the West indies.
They are also black.

1839
01:19:31,970 --> 01:19:35,090
So they also faced racism and yet they 
do well.

1840
01:19:35,510 --> 01:19:36,343
So it has to be something else.
And that other thing is the fact that 

1841
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:42,230
these black people who were in the 
south,

1842
01:19:42,470 --> 01:19:43,303
there's always been a big question.
We're black people robbed of their 

1843
01:19:45,501 --> 01:19:48,980
culture or did they preserve their 
authentic African culture?

1844
01:19:49,820 --> 01:19:53,180
And what soul is saying is that they 
were robbed of their culture.

1845
01:19:53,450 --> 01:19:57,110
And so they picked up the culture of the
people around them and the people around

1846
01:19:57,111 --> 01:19:57,944
them were rednecks.
And if you look at the white redneck 

1847
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:04,760
culture and the black redneck culture,
they have a lot of the same values.

1848
01:20:04,761 --> 01:20:06,590
They don't particularly respect 
education.

1849
01:20:06,990 --> 01:20:11,990
They love Jesus,
they use violence in their conflicts and

1850
01:20:12,270 --> 01:20:13,560
um,
they,

1851
01:20:13,590 --> 01:20:14,770
you know,
there's,

1852
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:15,660
there's just,
you know,

1853
01:20:15,661 --> 01:20:17,730
a lot of the same values and a lot of 
the same outcomes.

1854
01:20:17,910 --> 01:20:18,743
And even at bonaire,
which is black English is actually all 

1855
01:20:21,301 --> 01:20:23,670
from the west of England.
So it's actually,

1856
01:20:23,671 --> 01:20:26,460
this is from the west of England.
So for example,

1857
01:20:26,461 --> 01:20:28,770
if you go to places like Cornwall,
um,

1858
01:20:28,771 --> 01:20:30,870
there used to be this amazing,
um,

1859
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:33,540
uh,
these amazing ads on British TV,

1860
01:20:33,541 --> 01:20:34,890
right for this,
uh,

1861
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:37,290
this Devin custard or whatever.
And they would always say,

1862
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:38,071
Devin News,
oh,

1863
01:20:38,071 --> 01:20:40,590
they make it so creamy and they all talk
like this.

1864
01:20:40,591 --> 01:20:41,424
Right?
And so it doesn't sound like black 

1865
01:20:42,211 --> 01:20:44,070
English,
but they do say things like,

1866
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:44,933
oh,
you be doing that and we be doing this 

1867
01:20:46,530 --> 01:20:49,110
and you be doing that.
And they be doing that.

1868
01:20:49,130 --> 01:20:52,920
And so there's the use of that Copula be
right where instead of saying,

1869
01:20:52,921 --> 01:20:53,940
I am,
you are,

1870
01:20:53,941 --> 01:20:54,990
he is,
she is,

1871
01:20:54,991 --> 01:20:57,460
they are.
They just say I bub,

1872
01:20:57,510 --> 01:20:58,470
we be.
They be,

1873
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:00,690
which is the classic feature of Black 
English,

1874
01:21:00,691 --> 01:21:03,060
African American vernacular English 
right?

1875
01:21:03,150 --> 01:21:03,983
Now the point is,
is that how I'm blower mindblower now 

1876
01:21:07,830 --> 01:21:08,663
let's imagine that.
How do you think that Thomas Soul has 

1877
01:21:10,651 --> 01:21:12,330
been received by Liberal America?

1878
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,680
Not Well,
not well,

1879
01:21:16,681 --> 01:21:19,500
and so for example,
soul has a book called black rednecks,

1880
01:21:19,770 --> 01:21:21,810
white liberals.
Okay.

1881
01:21:22,230 --> 01:21:25,230
And his whole point is that,
you know,

1882
01:21:25,231 --> 01:21:26,520
if you actually,
and you know,

1883
01:21:26,521 --> 01:21:28,470
again like soul is,
you know,

1884
01:21:28,471 --> 01:21:30,900
he researches the shit out of this 
stuff.

1885
01:21:30,901 --> 01:21:32,820
He really does this work.
Now,

1886
01:21:32,910 --> 01:21:35,490
if you,
if you look at the experience of African

1887
01:21:35,491 --> 01:21:39,810
Americans after slavery after slavery,
they do really,

1888
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,910
they,
they start to make real progress,

1889
01:21:42,020 --> 01:21:42,853
right?
And a large part of the reason why they 

1890
01:21:43,951 --> 01:21:44,784
make progress is because you start to 
get a lot of people from New England 

1891
01:21:47,911 --> 01:21:48,744
either you know,
black people from New England or white 

1892
01:21:50,491 --> 01:21:53,850
people from New England who come down 
and sort of reshape the culture.

1893
01:21:53,851 --> 01:21:57,120
They create these schools and they're 
teaching those New England values,

1894
01:21:57,121 --> 01:21:59,010
right?
It's those puritan values of hard work,

1895
01:21:59,011 --> 01:22:00,660
tenacity,
all of that sort of stuff.

1896
01:22:00,930 --> 01:22:04,230
And so there's all this progress and you
have people like booker t Washington and

1897
01:22:04,231 --> 01:22:07,710
booker t dot Washington was an actual 
slave and then after he got his freedom,

1898
01:22:07,711 --> 01:22:10,860
he got to go work in a salt mine,
which is literally the worst job ever.

1899
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:13,680
And in booker t Washington's up from 
slavery,

1900
01:22:13,681 --> 01:22:14,514
he tells this great story about seeing a
school house right and that he thought 

1901
01:22:18,241 --> 01:22:22,170
that going into a school house was about
as close to heaven on earth as you could

1902
01:22:22,171 --> 01:22:23,004
get.
Like this is a dude who wanted an 

1903
01:22:25,231 --> 01:22:26,910
education really,
really badly,

1904
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:30,930
and that's a lot of what you find in the
early black experience in,

1905
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:33,270
you know,
the post slavery period.

1906
01:22:33,930 --> 01:22:34,890
And in fact,
you know,

1907
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:35,880
blacks,
you know,

1908
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:36,773
before sort of world war two actually 
had higher rates of marriage than 

1909
01:22:39,151 --> 01:22:39,984
whites.
All of these sorts of things that you 

1910
01:22:41,431 --> 01:22:45,270
know are now supposedly a problem.
And then there's this turnaround,

1911
01:22:45,390 --> 01:22:47,790
right?
The black experience starts to go south,

1912
01:22:47,850 --> 01:22:49,080
right?
It starts to get worse.

1913
01:22:49,081 --> 01:22:51,820
And what year is this around?
This is post World War Two,

1914
01:22:51,990 --> 01:22:52,823
right?
So,

1915
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:55,710
um,
so post slavery,

1916
01:22:56,130 --> 01:23:00,600
black people experience a rebounding,
they're starting to make some progress.

1917
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:02,640
There is ambition and I mean,
you know,

1918
01:23:02,641 --> 01:23:05,040
if in terms of books to read like,
you know,

1919
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:06,700
just because a large,
you know,

1920
01:23:06,701 --> 01:23:07,534
a large part of what I'm trying to do in
general is really let's move to the 

1921
01:23:11,111 --> 01:23:11,944
place of all people are created equal.
Like let's remove all these stupid 

1922
01:23:15,161 --> 01:23:16,180
distinctions,
right?

1923
01:23:16,181 --> 01:23:19,550
And really live that principle.
And the problem is,

1924
01:23:19,551 --> 01:23:21,910
is that in order to really live that 
principle,

1925
01:23:22,150 --> 01:23:24,430
you need a new narrative that beat 
slavery.

1926
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:25,511
So,
you know,

1927
01:23:25,511 --> 01:23:27,310
it's not.
If you go and talk to racist,

1928
01:23:27,311 --> 01:23:32,110
you can't just say racism is bad.
Like that doesn't destroy racism,

1929
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:33,233
right?
What destroys racism is when you make 

1930
01:23:34,661 --> 01:23:36,640
sense of the things that they know,
right?

1931
01:23:36,641 --> 01:23:37,474
They see people who are violent in the 
ghettos or they see crime or they see a 

1932
01:23:40,931 --> 01:23:44,800
lack of education or they see that 
Africa is poor and you're able to tell a

1933
01:23:44,801 --> 01:23:47,680
better story that makes sense of the 
things that they know,

1934
01:23:47,980 --> 01:23:50,470
but also comes out with the conclusion,
oh,

1935
01:23:50,471 --> 01:23:52,630
we actually all have the same potential.

1936
01:23:53,230 --> 01:23:54,063
Right?
But if you have this issue with people 

1937
01:23:55,031 --> 01:23:55,864
imitating their atmosphere in retaining 
their environment and this southern 

1938
01:23:58,961 --> 01:24:01,900
style talk with,
uh,

1939
01:24:01,901 --> 01:24:06,901
the southern redneck influence on the 
African American slaves,

1940
01:24:06,970 --> 01:24:08,410
former slaves,
how do you,

1941
01:24:08,470 --> 01:24:10,750
how do you stop that and how do you turn
that around?

1942
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:13,450
Well,
in general for humanity,

1943
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:14,313
I mean,
this is sort of a big problem for 

1944
01:24:14,771 --> 01:24:15,604
humanity in general is that there's not 
a culture alive today that is well 

1945
01:24:19,301 --> 01:24:20,770
suited to the world that we're living 
in.

1946
01:24:21,250 --> 01:24:22,900
And that's because,
you know,

1947
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:26,380
culture is adapted to environment in the
same way as any evolutionary thing.

1948
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:28,510
Right?
So for example,

1949
01:24:28,530 --> 01:24:30,290
you know,
if you look at a like,

1950
01:24:30,310 --> 01:24:31,930
let's talk about these hunter gatherers,
right?

1951
01:24:31,931 --> 01:24:32,764
The Anam Amo or something like that.
So there's a great story in the lost 

1952
01:24:35,711 --> 01:24:36,920
city ofZ ,
um,

1953
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:38,410
where,
you know,

1954
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:41,110
a Percy Fawcett who was an explorer 
comes across,

1955
01:24:41,111 --> 01:24:42,850
you know,
all these tribes in the Amazon,

1956
01:24:42,851 --> 01:24:46,690
and one of the examples that the author 
gives him there is a David Grann,

1957
01:24:46,691 --> 01:24:48,680
he talks about how,
um,

1958
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:49,593
you know,
there's this group of tribesmen in the 

1959
01:24:51,761 --> 01:24:52,594
Amazon and what they'll do is there's 
this special leaf and they go and they 

1960
01:24:55,501 --> 01:24:57,100
squeeze this leaf,
right?

1961
01:24:57,100 --> 01:24:57,933
They crush it up and this milky 
substance runs into the water and then 

1962
01:25:01,271 --> 01:25:04,990
all of a sudden the fish float up to the
surface upside down,

1963
01:25:05,110 --> 01:25:07,030
right?
They've been anesthetized by this.

1964
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:08,193
Whatever substance in the leaf.
And this little boy goes into the river 

1965
01:25:10,301 --> 01:25:14,350
and he plucks out all the fattest fish.
And then as the milky cloud dissipates,

1966
01:25:14,351 --> 01:25:16,720
the others fish swim away,
right?

1967
01:25:17,110 --> 01:25:18,630
Impressive as fuck.
Like,

1968
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:21,160
how the fuck did these tribesmen who 
don't have science,

1969
01:25:21,161 --> 01:25:23,590
don't have any of these things,
figure this thing out.

1970
01:25:23,620 --> 01:25:26,150
And it's cultural evolution.
That's what happens is,

1971
01:25:26,151 --> 01:25:27,520
is that,
that's the nature of evolution.

1972
01:25:27,521 --> 01:25:28,354
That's the nature of markets.
Because markets are an evolutionary 

1973
01:25:30,401 --> 01:25:31,510
process,
you know,

1974
01:25:31,511 --> 01:25:32,344
intelligent answers and intelligent 
solutions can emerge from just sort of 

1975
01:25:36,221 --> 01:25:37,054
competing forces and so all of these 
cultures are well adapted to a 

1976
01:25:40,571 --> 01:25:42,730
particular environment.
So if,

1977
01:25:42,790 --> 01:25:43,770
you know,
if you,

1978
01:25:43,810 --> 01:25:46,810
like we talked about American culture 
and we talked about Russian culture,

1979
01:25:46,811 --> 01:25:50,620
Russian culture selects for pessimism,
American culture because you had to move

1980
01:25:50,650 --> 01:25:52,600
all the way across the ocean,
right?

1981
01:25:52,810 --> 01:25:55,060
If you've got villages in Italy,
you know,

1982
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:56,680
Vietnam,
whatever it is,

1983
01:25:56,770 --> 01:25:58,960
who is the person in that village who 
says,

1984
01:25:59,050 --> 01:25:59,883
I'm going to go across the ocean to a 
country I know nothing about and you 

1985
01:26:04,461 --> 01:26:05,570
know,
make a fortune,

1986
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:08,450
right?
It's the most optimistic individual.

1987
01:26:08,510 --> 01:26:09,343
And so it's basically a magnet for all 
the most optimistic individuals in the 

1988
01:26:12,321 --> 01:26:13,850
world.
The analogy,

1989
01:26:13,851 --> 01:26:15,950
I always use this,
you ever see American tale,

1990
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:20,390
the like old animated movie from like 
the must be the nineties or whatever.

1991
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:22,850
Probably.
I don't think I saw that.

1992
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:25,700
Well,
it's about a group of animated.

1993
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:26,940
It's animated.
Yeah.

1994
01:26:27,450 --> 01:26:28,470
Um,
who,

1995
01:26:28,510 --> 01:26:30,680
who made it?
I don't know.

1996
01:26:30,770 --> 01:26:33,240
I'm trying to remember.
Um,

1997
01:26:33,620 --> 01:26:35,930
it's not Disney.
That's it.

1998
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:38,260
No,
I don't think I saw that students,

1999
01:26:38,330 --> 01:26:39,560
Spielberg will.
Anyway,

2000
01:26:39,620 --> 01:26:41,060
it's,
it's sort of about the,

2001
01:26:41,090 --> 01:26:41,923
it's about the immigrant experience more
generally and then specifically sort of 

2002
01:26:44,451 --> 01:26:46,100
about the Russian Jewish experience.

2003
01:26:46,570 --> 01:26:48,680
Um,
and it's about this family,

2004
01:26:48,681 --> 01:26:53,681
the mouse Kevitsa is and right there on 
that,

2005
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:54,913
on that trunk,
there's a 500 miles Kovitz and five old 

2006
01:26:58,360 --> 01:26:59,960
mouse Kovitz,
um,

2007
01:26:59,990 --> 01:27:00,823
you know,
in the first part there in Russia and 

2008
01:27:02,481 --> 01:27:04,850
the,
they're all being persecuted by cats,

2009
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:08,120
right?
Because there might be 500 miles of it's

2010
01:27:08,130 --> 01:27:11,840
sings a song with all of the other 
Moskovitz is called.

2011
01:27:11,841 --> 01:27:12,674
There are no cats in America,
which is so much of what the American 

2012
01:27:16,821 --> 01:27:18,470
immigrant experiences about.
Right.

2013
01:27:18,471 --> 01:27:19,161
You're like,
oh,

2014
01:27:19,161 --> 01:27:21,290
it's all going to be perfect land of 
opportunity.

2015
01:27:21,291 --> 01:27:24,380
The streets are paved with gold excepted
an American tale.

2016
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:29,500
The streets are paved with cheese,
American t a L.

2017
01:27:30,740 --> 01:27:33,360
exactly.
Or Til t a.

2018
01:27:34,050 --> 01:27:36,350
yeah,
exactly.

2019
01:27:36,380 --> 01:27:37,670
Yeah.
Um,

2020
01:27:37,970 --> 01:27:38,840
so,
so the,

2021
01:27:38,870 --> 01:27:40,640
these different environments,
right?

2022
01:27:40,641 --> 01:27:43,220
Just as you have different environments,
select for different,

2023
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:44,113
uh,
different beaks or wings or whatever it 

2024
01:27:46,701 --> 01:27:48,830
is,
select for different mindsets,

2025
01:27:48,831 --> 01:27:51,140
different ways of thinking,
different cultural traits.

2026
01:27:51,170 --> 01:27:52,003
Right?
And what ends up happening is we become 

2027
01:27:54,171 --> 01:27:56,210
well adapted to a particular 
environment.

2028
01:27:56,330 --> 01:27:57,163
So what happens to the point of the lost
city of z is what happened to all of 

2029
01:28:00,951 --> 01:28:03,740
these European explorers who went into 
the Amazon?

2030
01:28:04,070 --> 01:28:04,903
Well,
a lot of them fucking tide and that's 

2031
01:28:06,681 --> 01:28:09,440
because they're doing things that are 
well suited to England,

2032
01:28:09,441 --> 01:28:12,200
like walking around in wool suits and 
eating cans of chipped beef,

2033
01:28:12,410 --> 01:28:13,243
but suddenly when you're in the hundred 
degree heat of the Amazon and there's 

2034
01:28:16,761 --> 01:28:21,740
all these animals you don't understand 
and you don't know how to use the plants

2035
01:28:21,741 --> 01:28:24,680
that you squeeze and have the anesthetic
in them and all that sort of stuff,

2036
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:26,600
you can't survive.
Right?

2037
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:30,200
And what they called in velocity of CSI,
all the explorers,

2038
01:28:30,201 --> 01:28:33,140
they called it the Amazon UK counterfeit
paradise.

2039
01:28:33,380 --> 01:28:36,560
It looked like a paradise was so lush.
It was so tropical,

2040
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:37,513
but there were like,
there's nothing to fucking eat except 

2041
01:28:39,860 --> 01:28:43,880
clearly there was because Amazonian 
people had been living there for tens of

2042
01:28:43,881 --> 01:28:44,930
thousands of years.

2043
01:28:45,260 --> 01:28:46,093
They just did.
The Westerners didn't have the cultural 

2044
01:28:47,721 --> 01:28:50,870
software that was well suited to 
surviving in that environment.

2045
01:28:50,990 --> 01:28:53,440
So how does this translate into 
African-american's?

2046
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:54,553
So what is the environment that created 
that southern redneck culture and the 

2047
01:28:59,691 --> 01:29:03,360
environment it turns out is right?
So raising sheep,

2048
01:29:03,361 --> 01:29:04,194
raising goats and all that stuff.
Because most of the people who are in 

2049
01:29:07,051 --> 01:29:09,540
the south,
I'm originally came from the Scots.

2050
01:29:09,541 --> 01:29:10,374
Irish.
And when you look at hurting cultures 

2051
01:29:12,511 --> 01:29:14,910
around the world,
they all have certain traits in common,

2052
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:15,893
right?
So if you're a herder where you have a 

2053
01:29:17,491 --> 01:29:18,570
big,
big problem,

2054
01:29:18,660 --> 01:29:20,880
and that big big problem is property 
rights.

2055
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:24,930
So if you're a farmer,
there are clear boundaries on my land.

2056
01:29:24,990 --> 01:29:26,760
Now there are ways you can try and fuck 
me.

2057
01:29:26,790 --> 01:29:30,690
You can try and move the boundary stones
on my land slowly into your field,

2058
01:29:30,691 --> 01:29:31,351
over,
over,

2059
01:29:31,351 --> 01:29:32,184
over,
over.

2060
01:29:32,430 --> 01:29:35,340
But what we usually have is we have some
sort of government,

2061
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:36,203
there's a local town official that we go
to and he is responsible for policing 

2062
01:29:39,631 --> 01:29:40,464
the boundaries.
And so towns would do things where you 

2063
01:29:42,351 --> 01:29:43,184
know,
you would essentially all get together 

2064
01:29:43,681 --> 01:29:46,850
and we go walk the boundary stones and 
we make sure that none of those boundary

2065
01:29:46,851 --> 01:29:47,684
stones had moved.
So the intuition of people from the 

2066
01:29:49,891 --> 01:29:50,724
North Pier,
people like that is if we have a 

2067
01:29:52,741 --> 01:29:53,574
problem,
we go to the government and we resolve 

2068
01:29:54,811 --> 01:29:58,830
it through the government,
right in the environment of hurting,

2069
01:29:59,100 --> 01:29:59,933
you can come over and you can steal my 
sheep and you can mix the sheep in with 

2070
01:30:03,211 --> 01:30:07,200
your flock and I have no way to prove 
which my sh which cheaper my sheep.

2071
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:09,600
So we evolve things like branding,
right?

2072
01:30:09,601 --> 01:30:10,434
Where I have a brand,
I put it on my sheep and all that sort 

2073
01:30:11,761 --> 01:30:12,480
of stuff.

2074
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:16,680
But there's another strategy that is 
used that evolved before branding.

2075
01:30:17,010 --> 01:30:20,310
And that earlier strategy is being a 
crazy motherfucker.

2076
01:30:20,580 --> 01:30:24,540
You establish a reputation as the kind 
of guy that you don't fuck with you.

2077
01:30:24,541 --> 01:30:27,000
Come on my land,
I kill you.

2078
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:30,720
You touch my sheep or my women,
I fucking kill you.

2079
01:30:30,930 --> 01:30:35,930
And I use such an aggressive level of 
violence that you know that you know,

2080
01:30:36,210 --> 01:30:38,550
there is no point in fucking with.
I mean,

2081
01:30:38,610 --> 01:30:40,230
this is not plausible because I'm saying
it,

2082
01:30:40,231 --> 01:30:42,120
but let's imagine it much tougher 
person.

2083
01:30:42,121 --> 01:30:43,470
Conor Mcgregor,
for example,

2084
01:30:43,471 --> 01:30:46,380
is a great example.
You don't fuck with conor Mcgregor,

2085
01:30:46,530 --> 01:30:47,363
right?
He has a reputation as just being a bad 

2086
01:30:49,081 --> 01:30:50,960
ass motherfucker who will fuck you up.
Right?

2087
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:52,800
So that's how you keep people off your 
land.

2088
01:30:52,830 --> 01:30:54,300
That's right.
And if you look at,

2089
01:30:54,301 --> 01:30:55,790
let's look at a couple of other 
cultures.

2090
01:30:55,870 --> 01:30:58,290
So hurt cultures include the scots,
Irish,

2091
01:30:58,291 --> 01:30:59,460
who are the rednecks.

2092
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:02,850
A herder cultures include the 
Mongolians,

2093
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:03,713
right?
The Mongols notoriously a very gentle 

2094
01:31:05,311 --> 01:31:07,100
peace loving people,
right?

2095
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:09,900
And they include the Bedouins and where 
the Arabs,

2096
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:10,973
right,
who had camels and all that sort of 

2097
01:31:12,121 --> 01:31:12,954
stuff.
And you'll notice that there is that 

2098
01:31:14,191 --> 01:31:17,520
same use of violence and mostly they 
fight amongst themselves.

2099
01:31:17,521 --> 01:31:18,354
There's this inter clan warfare,
but periodically a charismatic figure 

2100
01:31:21,290 --> 01:31:22,123
emerged is who unites the clans.
So gangas con manages to unite the 

2101
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:28,980
Mongols and then what are the Mongols 
proceed to do?

2102
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:31,740
They proceed to go use that aggressive 
use of violence.

2103
01:31:31,890 --> 01:31:34,890
They have those horses which allow them 
to move quickly,

2104
01:31:34,891 --> 01:31:36,840
right?
And they're really effective and they go

2105
01:31:36,841 --> 01:31:39,180
and they fuck everybody up,
right?

2106
01:31:39,450 --> 01:31:40,283
Because you know,
the gentle farmers of China aren't 

2107
01:31:42,091 --> 01:31:43,770
prepared for that.
And the gentle farmers,

2108
01:31:43,771 --> 01:31:46,230
a Persian aren't prepared for that.
What happens with the Arabs,

2109
01:31:46,231 --> 01:31:48,210
the Arabs are mostly fighting amongst 
themselves.

2110
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:49,253
But then along comes this charismatic 
figure with a new belief system that 

2111
01:31:51,901 --> 01:31:52,734
unites the Muhammad and he unites them 
and suddenly they fuck everybody up and 

2112
01:31:56,641 --> 01:31:58,710
they create this great empire,
the caliphate,

2113
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:03,220
right spreads all across Central Asia 
and the Middle East and all across north

2114
01:32:03,221 --> 01:32:04,210
Africa.
Right?

2115
01:32:04,570 --> 01:32:07,240
And in many ways that is what Donald 
Trump is.

2116
01:32:07,510 --> 01:32:08,350
They've been,
you know,

2117
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:11,650
the rednecks been fighting amongst 
themselves for a long time.

2118
01:32:11,830 --> 01:32:15,070
And then Donald Trump,
the gang is con of America.

2119
01:32:15,071 --> 01:32:19,300
The Mohamad of America has succeeded in 
uniting the clans and you know,

2120
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:20,193
in our time,
you don't do it by going out and like 

2121
01:32:22,421 --> 01:32:23,254
raping and pillaging.
You go and you seize the ballot box and 

2122
01:32:25,781 --> 01:32:29,140
you vote and you know,
you really like take back power.

2123
01:32:29,530 --> 01:32:31,570
And so that's what they've done.
Um,

2124
01:32:31,780 --> 01:32:33,430
but there are,
if you look,

2125
01:32:33,431 --> 01:32:36,880
there are certain problems that occur 
across these herder cultures.

2126
01:32:37,090 --> 01:32:38,620
So if you're,
you know,

2127
01:32:38,621 --> 01:32:39,690
as a friend of mine.

2128
01:32:39,910 --> 01:32:41,800
So you're saying essentially saying that
the south,

2129
01:32:41,830 --> 01:32:45,580
is that the reason why Donald Trump has 
been elected because of the south,

2130
01:32:45,730 --> 01:32:46,350
because of the herder

2131
01:32:46,350 --> 01:32:47,141
culture?
Well,

2132
01:32:47,141 --> 01:32:49,900
and it's also,
so if you've read Hillbilly Elegy,

2133
01:32:49,901 --> 01:32:52,900
jd Vance's book,
it's an excellent,

2134
01:32:52,901 --> 01:32:53,734
right?
But he's really talking about this 

2135
01:32:54,221 --> 01:32:57,340
hillbilly culture and so it's not just 
the south.

2136
01:32:57,370 --> 01:32:58,680
Right?
So what happened is,

2137
01:32:58,681 --> 01:33:01,410
is that it's Redneck,
it's rednecks,

2138
01:33:01,420 --> 01:33:02,650
which is a,
or you know,

2139
01:33:02,651 --> 01:33:04,680
whatever or hillbillies or whatever you 
want to call them.

2140
01:33:04,681 --> 01:33:05,620
The folk.
Well,

2141
01:33:05,621 --> 01:33:06,454
it's not even simple folk,
it's just a particular culture and they 

2142
01:33:08,081 --> 01:33:08,914
have certain values and I just,
it's also worth clarifying because of 

2143
01:33:11,141 --> 01:33:11,974
the way that I sound and where I come 
from and the fact that I went to 

2144
01:33:14,351 --> 01:33:15,870
Harvard.
Yeah.

2145
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:19,270
And vitamin than that.
I'm not a part of that tribe that,

2146
01:33:19,271 --> 01:33:20,104
you know,
Americans owe a tremendous debt to the 

2147
01:33:22,361 --> 01:33:25,960
hillbilly culture and that tremendous 
debt is that overwhelmingly they are the

2148
01:33:25,961 --> 01:33:26,794
people who have served in the military 
and they are overwhelmingly the people 

2149
01:33:29,081 --> 01:33:32,320
who have fought our wars and blood and 
died and all that sort of stuff.

2150
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:33,660
And that's stuff that,
you know,

2151
01:33:33,910 --> 01:33:34,743
I may sound like a liberal,
but I don't really sit in either of 

2152
01:33:37,031 --> 01:33:38,050
those cultures.
Right.

2153
01:33:38,051 --> 01:33:43,051
I can critique the liberal culture and I
can critique the hillbilly culture.

2154
01:33:43,390 --> 01:33:44,470
Right.
And you know,

2155
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:45,333
white liberals,
the whole reason why I started this 

2156
01:33:46,301 --> 01:33:47,134
thing off is because white liberals have
their own weird things that are 

2157
01:33:49,301 --> 01:33:51,910
dysfunctional in that aren't helping 
black people and all that stuff.

2158
01:33:51,970 --> 01:33:52,803
If you just wore a bow tie,
people would think you were 

2159
01:33:53,771 --> 01:33:54,604
conservative.
So you have to do well then there you 

2160
01:33:55,781 --> 01:33:59,020
go.
Or maybe you have a bolo tie.

2161
01:33:59,021 --> 01:34:01,660
One hundred percent.
Actually I would like to do that.

2162
01:34:01,690 --> 01:34:04,540
Like I like the texting Carter rancher 
rancher,

2163
01:34:04,860 --> 01:34:07,720
jade right there and pull that George W 
Bush be from Connecticut,

2164
01:34:07,721 --> 01:34:08,230
but dress

2165
01:34:08,230 --> 01:34:09,910
like a cowboy.
He was from Maine.

2166
01:34:11,950 --> 01:34:13,720
Maine is,
I mean Kennebunk port.

2167
01:34:13,750 --> 01:34:14,583
That's where they're from.
That is the whitest of white fucking 

2168
01:34:16,930 --> 01:34:20,740
north and people ever.
French folks.

2169
01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:23,050
Maine is filled with French folks.
Maniacs.

2170
01:34:23,110 --> 01:34:23,943
Yeah.

2171
01:34:24,010 --> 01:34:26,900
I'm also originally,
you know more your neck of the woods.

2172
01:34:27,530 --> 01:34:28,370
Yeah,
Boston.

2173
01:34:28,730 --> 01:34:32,840
I did a lot of gigs in Maine.
Maine's a fascinating place because it's

2174
01:34:32,841 --> 01:34:35,380
a entirely abandoned.
Yep.

2175
01:34:35,540 --> 01:34:36,373
There's a couple of cities and you have 
to drive like vast distances in between 

2176
01:34:40,791 --> 01:34:42,680
them.
When you go from Portland to Bangor,

2177
01:34:42,820 --> 01:34:47,060
there was just like 50 plus mile stretch
where there's nothing on the road.

2178
01:34:47,061 --> 01:34:50,300
It's a two lane highway and there ain't 
shit on that road.

2179
01:34:50,330 --> 01:34:51,680
No gas,
no nothing.

2180
01:34:51,681 --> 01:34:53,150
If you don't have gas,
you're fucked.

2181
01:34:53,240 --> 01:34:54,320
Did you ever run out of gas?

2182
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:56,930
Did you ever hear?
There's a friend of mine,

2183
01:34:57,080 --> 01:34:58,130
dad's from Maine

2184
01:34:58,370 --> 01:35:02,360
and he has all these great main isms and
one of them is a,

2185
01:35:02,390 --> 01:35:03,223
Oh,
you gotta go up past soy as band and 

2186
01:35:05,150 --> 01:35:08,210
past Sawyer's barn is any place that is 
far away.

2187
01:35:08,420 --> 01:35:11,480
Oh.
Which is I think fucking amazing.

2188
01:35:11,481 --> 01:35:12,314
Wow.
So that's sort of like the version of 

2189
01:35:14,421 --> 01:35:15,710
uh,
the uh,

2190
01:35:15,860 --> 01:35:17,930
Islamic 72 virgins.
Yeah.

2191
01:35:18,710 --> 01:35:21,120
Right.
Like 72 virgins just means a shitload of

2192
01:35:21,140 --> 01:35:21,980
virgins.
Yeah.

2193
01:35:21,981 --> 01:35:23,790
It doesn't really mean the number seven 
too.

2194
01:35:23,930 --> 01:35:25,190
Yeah.
Yeah.

2195
01:35:25,250 --> 01:35:25,871
Well,
you know,

2196
01:35:25,871 --> 01:35:26,704
it's,
you're saying you have a passel of 

2197
01:35:27,261 --> 01:35:28,094
virgin.
It's like there's a good chunk of 

2198
01:35:29,151 --> 01:35:30,020
virgin.
Right?

2199
01:35:30,050 --> 01:35:31,760
So we get back to this,
um,

2200
01:35:31,790 --> 01:35:33,770
African American culture.
So how does it,

2201
01:35:33,830 --> 01:35:36,170
how does it correct itself?
So what ends up happening?

2202
01:35:36,230 --> 01:35:37,530
Yeah,
what you have to do is,

2203
01:35:37,531 --> 01:35:38,364
is that you just have to have a much 
larger conversation about culture and 

2204
01:35:41,211 --> 01:35:42,950
you have to talk about how culture 
works.

2205
01:35:43,190 --> 01:35:45,350
You have to say it's not your fault,
right?

2206
01:35:45,351 --> 01:35:47,990
Because the point is,
is that imitate our atmosphere.

2207
01:35:48,020 --> 01:35:50,350
We imitate our atmosphere.
And the reality is,

2208
01:35:50,351 --> 01:35:51,020
is that,
you know,

2209
01:35:51,020 --> 01:35:55,190
these cultures are very old,
that hurt her culture is the same one.

2210
01:35:55,191 --> 01:35:56,024
And that's the big ironies is that 
you're not saying that it's about black 

2211
01:35:58,461 --> 01:36:00,470
people,
it's about rednecks,

2212
01:36:00,471 --> 01:36:02,470
whether they're white rednecks or black 
red necks.

2213
01:36:02,510 --> 01:36:03,343
So that hurt our culture has just 
inexorably tied itself into the African 

2214
01:36:07,371 --> 01:36:10,790
American culture without the African 
Americans even knowing that it happened.

2215
01:36:10,791 --> 01:36:12,920
Exactly.
Which is the nature of culture.

2216
01:36:12,980 --> 01:36:13,813
And it's also,
it's only tied itself into this very 

2217
01:36:16,311 --> 01:36:19,220
specific subset of Africa of black 
culture,

2218
01:36:19,221 --> 01:36:22,040
which is why the people in the West 
indies have a completely different.

2219
01:36:22,210 --> 01:36:23,270
Whoa.
Oh Wow.

2220
01:36:23,300 --> 01:36:24,133
And if you talk,
if you talk to people who are literally 

2221
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:26,953
Africans who immigrated to America,
like from Ethiopia or Kenya or anything 

2222
01:36:30,261 --> 01:36:31,280
like that,
you know,

2223
01:36:31,281 --> 01:36:33,700
if you ever get an Ethiopian cab driver,
right?

2224
01:36:33,790 --> 01:36:35,140
So hard working.
Yeah.

2225
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:36,073
Talk to them,
talk to them about how they feel about 

2226
01:36:38,661 --> 01:36:40,850
that sort of ghetto black culture,
those black rednecks.

2227
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,250
They fucking hate it.
Hey fucking hate it.

2228
01:36:43,490 --> 01:36:44,870
And the point is this,
because a,

2229
01:36:44,890 --> 01:36:46,700
it gives them a bad name,
right?

2230
01:36:46,730 --> 01:36:47,563
You know,
and people see a black person and 

2231
01:36:48,531 --> 01:36:49,311
they're like,
oh,

2232
01:36:49,311 --> 01:36:50,840
you're like probably this,
this,

2233
01:36:50,841 --> 01:36:51,291
this,
this,

2234
01:36:51,291 --> 01:36:52,520
this.
Because again,

2235
01:36:52,580 --> 01:36:55,220
human stereotype because of the Dunbar 
number,

2236
01:36:55,250 --> 01:36:56,083
because we can only track 150 people.
And so we have to make up stories about 

2237
01:36:58,971 --> 01:36:59,321
them.
Yeah,

2238
01:36:59,321 --> 01:37:01,340
we fit into this rednecks.
That's right.

2239
01:37:01,550 --> 01:37:03,170
Oh you have a dukes of hazzard tee 
shirt.

2240
01:37:03,530 --> 01:37:06,020
You are.
And we do that.

2241
01:37:06,021 --> 01:37:07,010
And you know,
that's the point.

2242
01:37:07,011 --> 01:37:07,844
The listeners are going to be sitting 
here and they're going to be trying to 

2243
01:37:09,231 --> 01:37:11,300
categorize me and all of this sort of 
stuff.

2244
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:12,313
And you know,
part of what you're dealing with is you 

2245
01:37:13,221 --> 01:37:14,054
start talking about gender or anything 
like that and the social justice 

2246
01:37:16,281 --> 01:37:18,380
warriors try and put you into some 
bucket and you're like,

2247
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:20,720
no,
I don't belong in that bucket.

2248
01:37:20,770 --> 01:37:22,640
You're constantly trying to say I'm not 
in that bucket.

2249
01:37:22,850 --> 01:37:25,100
So you could imagine if you're 
Ethiopian,

2250
01:37:25,130 --> 01:37:25,963
right,
and you've moved here and you really 

2251
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:30,260
sort of believe in the American Dream 
Land of opportunity and we work hard and

2252
01:37:30,261 --> 01:37:31,094
we all do this sort of stuff.
And You keep getting put in that bucket 

2253
01:37:34,070 --> 01:37:36,800
with all this sort of rap culture or 
anything like that,

2254
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:38,540
you're going to be annoyed.
It does.

2255
01:37:38,541 --> 01:37:41,270
Like if you're a Sikh and people want to
beat your ass,

2256
01:37:41,390 --> 01:37:43,760
far as the Muslims bombed,
you know,

2257
01:37:43,761 --> 01:37:47,150
nine slash 11,
like it's not even near the same part of

2258
01:37:47,151 --> 01:37:48,410
the world.
Oh fuck heads.

2259
01:37:48,411 --> 01:37:50,450
Nope,
totally different headgear.

2260
01:37:51,770 --> 01:37:55,070
But to the person on the outside trying 
to categorize.

2261
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:56,040
That's right.
They're trying to make

2262
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:56,873
sense of it.

2263
01:37:57,400 --> 01:37:58,990
But,
and that's the point is,

2264
01:37:58,991 --> 01:38:01,900
is that when you start to have a 
conversation that is about culture,

2265
01:38:02,110 --> 01:38:02,943
then you start to realize that race 
doesn't actually matter and what you'll 

2266
01:38:05,741 --> 01:38:07,810
find is,
so let's take a look at,

2267
01:38:07,811 --> 01:38:08,830
for example,
Asians,

2268
01:38:09,160 --> 01:38:09,993
Asians do very well in school.
They're very productive and all that 

2269
01:38:12,011 --> 01:38:15,430
sort of stuff except for the Hmong,
right?

2270
01:38:15,431 --> 01:38:17,930
So there's a group of people called the 
Hmong and they're,

2271
01:38:17,980 --> 01:38:20,980
they're the big Asian exception.
And you know,

2272
01:38:20,981 --> 01:38:22,600
they do things.
I'm hunters,

2273
01:38:22,690 --> 01:38:24,580
big time hunters.
Um,

2274
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:26,980
you know,
there's a lot of violence,

2275
01:38:27,180 --> 01:38:30,070
uh,
not a lot of education,

2276
01:38:30,100 --> 01:38:30,933
right?
They don't sort of fall into that sort 

2277
01:38:32,471 --> 01:38:36,280
of stereotype of becoming engineers and 
doctors and from what part of the world,

2278
01:38:36,310 --> 01:38:38,170
they're like Cambodia,
Vietnam,

2279
01:38:38,171 --> 01:38:41,890
like what used to be called Indochina.
They don't have their own country.

2280
01:38:42,220 --> 01:38:43,200
No,
no,

2281
01:38:43,260 --> 01:38:44,093
they're,
they're tribal grouping that sort of 

2282
01:38:44,891 --> 01:38:48,610
exists across national boundaries 
because in general,

2283
01:38:48,850 --> 01:38:49,830
you know,
one of the great,

2284
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:50,713
uh,
destructive forces in human history is 

2285
01:38:52,271 --> 01:38:53,710
the British map maker.

2286
01:38:55,750 --> 01:38:56,583
You know what I mean?
Like Europeans just love a straight 

2287
01:38:58,391 --> 01:38:59,224
line.
They just can't get enough of the 

2288
01:39:01,991 --> 01:39:03,330
straight line.
And so they were just like,

2289
01:39:03,610 --> 01:39:04,443
and you know,
like that the straight line works in 

2290
01:39:05,981 --> 01:39:09,070
middle America because you've already 
wiped out all the tribes.

2291
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:09,880
Right?
Right.

2292
01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:10,713
But it doesn't work so well in Africa 
where there are still tribes or 

2293
01:39:12,431 --> 01:39:15,430
Southeast Asia where you suddenly start 
like drawing a line,

2294
01:39:15,431 --> 01:39:16,264
right between two tribal groups or 
across a tribal group and suddenly now 

2295
01:39:20,141 --> 01:39:21,480
shit's all fucked up.
And they're,

2296
01:39:21,550 --> 01:39:22,383
what they're trying to do when they're 
having all these civil wars as they're 

2297
01:39:23,981 --> 01:39:25,600
trying to unfuck the boundaries.

2298
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:29,170
A straight lines are annoying.
Yeah.

2299
01:39:29,230 --> 01:39:30,063
They all know it's really hilarious when
you get busted for transporting 

2300
01:39:32,111 --> 01:39:35,800
something across state lines like my 
allowed to drive around with this or not

2301
01:39:36,550 --> 01:39:37,383
like what?
What's the fucking law like if you have 

2302
01:39:39,161 --> 01:39:42,250
pot in particular.
I mean you cross a state line,

2303
01:39:42,251 --> 01:39:43,084
you go from being someone who is 
innocent 100 percent to someone who's 

2304
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:48,580
guilty.
One hundred percent of a felony.

2305
01:39:48,610 --> 01:39:49,600
Yup.
Yeah.

2306
01:39:49,601 --> 01:39:51,070
Well they're there.
It's so bizarre.

2307
01:39:51,071 --> 01:39:54,370
I mean in one one side states' rights or
a,

2308
01:39:54,490 --> 01:39:57,280
an amazing idea for testing ideas out.
Sure.

2309
01:39:57,340 --> 01:39:59,680
You know,
like testing out with like with Colorado

2310
01:39:59,681 --> 01:40:01,390
illegal legal marijuana again.
That's right.

2311
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:02,393
Worked out,
worked out great and people wouldn't 

2312
01:40:03,551 --> 01:40:04,660
look,
this is working.

2313
01:40:04,690 --> 01:40:06,250
It's profitable.
It helps everybody.

2314
01:40:06,251 --> 01:40:06,971
Let's go.
Yeah.

2315
01:40:06,971 --> 01:40:09,290
And then it's,
it's sold the idea to other pe.

2316
01:40:09,530 --> 01:40:10,363
That's right.
And then there's other places like open 

2317
01:40:11,951 --> 01:40:16,660
carry and you're like a hey,
are you sure?

2318
01:40:16,900 --> 01:40:18,370
You sure?
Every concealed carry.

2319
01:40:18,371 --> 01:40:19,720
Okay.
You could just have a gun on you.

2320
01:40:19,721 --> 01:40:21,340
Everywhere you go,
you have the movie theater.

2321
01:40:21,341 --> 01:40:22,010
Okay.

2322
01:40:22,010 --> 01:40:24,910
But where are the places where that's 
true south?

2323
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,370
Yeah.
And that's because it's,

2324
01:40:27,410 --> 01:40:28,243
again,
it comes down to the what this is being 

2325
01:40:29,781 --> 01:40:30,614
driven by.
It's being driven by old cultural 

2326
01:40:31,791 --> 01:40:33,650
baggage.
That doesn't necessarily make sense.

2327
01:40:33,860 --> 01:40:35,780
So the guy who.
So there's really,

2328
01:40:35,781 --> 01:40:37,940
in terms of honor cultures,
there are four books,

2329
01:40:37,941 --> 01:40:40,040
right?
That I think that if you want to go into

2330
01:40:40,041 --> 01:40:41,780
this,
like don't get angry at me,

2331
01:40:41,781 --> 01:40:43,880
just read the four books.
Those books,

2332
01:40:43,940 --> 01:40:46,940
those books are a black red necks,
white liberals,

2333
01:40:46,941 --> 01:40:50,120
Thomas Souls Book,
a culture of honor,

2334
01:40:50,180 --> 01:40:53,830
which is Richard Nisbett book.
I'm jd Vance's,

2335
01:40:53,831 --> 01:40:54,664
hillbilly elegy.
And then a book called the short and 

2336
01:40:57,461 --> 01:40:59,860
tragic life of Robert Peace.
Um,

2337
01:41:00,220 --> 01:41:01,053
and those four books essentially,
if you read those four books and you're 

2338
01:41:04,421 --> 01:41:07,660
still saying that,
what I'm saying is unsubstantiated,

2339
01:41:07,720 --> 01:41:09,730
you know,
well then we should talk about it.

2340
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:10,593
Or are there a lot of liberals that are 
up in arms and you propose these things 

2341
01:41:13,210 --> 01:41:14,740
start bringing up the hurt or culture?

2342
01:41:14,740 --> 01:41:15,573
No.
What about the Patriarchy and white 

2343
01:41:16,511 --> 01:41:17,740
racism?
Exactly.

2344
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:18,633
Know race.
You can't be racist towards white 

2345
01:41:19,871 --> 01:41:20,704
people.
That's one of my favorite things that 

2346
01:41:21,791 --> 01:41:24,340
people are saying today that you can't 
be racist and white people.

2347
01:41:24,341 --> 01:41:26,260
Yeah.
There's a lot of favorite things to say.

2348
01:41:26,261 --> 01:41:28,540
People are saying a lot of weird and 
wacky shit,

2349
01:41:28,620 --> 01:41:29,453
but that's one of the wackiest like of 
course you can like that's racism only 

2350
01:41:33,461 --> 01:41:35,230
works when someone has power.
Well,

2351
01:41:35,231 --> 01:41:38,170
when you racist to someone,
you have power over a period.

2352
01:41:38,710 --> 01:41:40,000
Cultural power.
Like what?

2353
01:41:40,001 --> 01:41:42,580
Presumed across the board by black and 
white.

2354
01:41:42,581 --> 01:41:43,660
Like real,
real simple.

2355
01:41:43,661 --> 01:41:45,910
Yes or no.
Binary one or a zero.

2356
01:41:45,911 --> 01:41:47,740
Is that what we're doing?
Is that people?

2357
01:41:47,741 --> 01:41:48,620
Of course not.
No,

2358
01:41:48,621 --> 01:41:49,930
of course not.
Of course not.

2359
01:41:49,931 --> 01:41:53,070
Of course you can be racist,
you could judge someone prejudice Lee.

2360
01:41:53,110 --> 01:41:53,943
Well,
and in fact that is the key thing with 

2361
01:41:56,051 --> 01:41:58,090
Richard Nisbett book,
the culture of honor.

2362
01:41:58,330 --> 01:41:59,163
So nesbitt was a professor in the 
nineties at the height of political 

2363
01:42:01,901 --> 01:42:02,734
correctness and he wanted to study 
culture and the problem was that he's a 

2364
01:42:06,221 --> 01:42:07,054
white man from the south and he knew 
that if you studied any culture you 

2365
01:42:10,301 --> 01:42:14,890
would have to say bad things about it.
So what does Richard Nesbitt do?

2366
01:42:15,130 --> 01:42:16,420
He says,
ally,

2367
01:42:16,421 --> 01:42:19,930
no one culture that I can say bad things
about on a college campus.

2368
01:42:20,260 --> 01:42:23,080
I can say bad things about southern 
culture.

2369
01:42:23,380 --> 01:42:27,790
That's a culture I can criticize freely.
And so what he did,

2370
01:42:27,791 --> 01:42:28,624
and you know,
this I think gets really down to what 

2371
01:42:29,771 --> 01:42:33,100
are the strengths of know sort of 
broadly northern and southern culture.

2372
01:42:33,130 --> 01:42:34,060
Right?
And you know,

2373
01:42:34,061 --> 01:42:36,460
Kennedy,
John F Kennedy had this great line about

2374
01:42:36,461 --> 01:42:37,294
Washington DC.
He said that it was a city of southern 

2375
01:42:39,491 --> 01:42:44,320
efficiency and northern charm.
That's interesting.

2376
01:42:44,380 --> 01:42:46,020
Yeah.
And um,

2377
01:42:46,180 --> 01:42:46,720
you know,
the,

2378
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:47,553
the potential for America is to be a 
country of southern charm and northern 

2379
01:42:50,831 --> 01:42:53,320
efficiency,
but we're kind of got it backwards right

2380
01:42:53,321 --> 01:42:54,154
now,
right?

2381
01:42:54,340 --> 01:42:55,690
Um,
but so what,

2382
01:42:55,750 --> 01:42:58,990
what Nesbitt is doing is,
is that he's charming the liberals,

2383
01:42:58,991 --> 01:43:00,790
right?
Which is what southerners do.

2384
01:43:00,820 --> 01:43:02,950
He's like,
I'm going to study culture,

2385
01:43:02,951 --> 01:43:07,330
but I'm going to study white southern 
culture and I'm going to show how bad it

2386
01:43:07,331 --> 01:43:08,164
is.
Right?

2387
01:43:08,290 --> 01:43:09,520
And so they're like,
oh,

2388
01:43:09,521 --> 01:43:11,830
okay.
That feels safe and comfortable.

2389
01:43:11,890 --> 01:43:14,200
Right.
And that's essentially how he worked his

2390
01:43:14,201 --> 01:43:17,830
way into the conversation.
And specifically what he knew is he knew

2391
01:43:17,831 --> 01:43:18,664
that southern culture had this very 
particular problem and this very 

2392
01:43:21,670 --> 01:43:22,503
particular problem was that it had 
higher rates of homicide in very 

2393
01:43:24,701 --> 01:43:28,510
specific categories.
So it had a higher rates of,

2394
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:29,830
um,
you know,

2395
01:43:29,890 --> 01:43:30,723
uh,
basically killings around trespassing 

2396
01:43:32,590 --> 01:43:34,550
and then killings around,
you know,

2397
01:43:34,570 --> 01:43:35,500
lovers,
triangles.

2398
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:38,410
And so for example,
until 1970,

2399
01:43:38,830 --> 01:43:42,520
if you found your wife in bed with 
another man in Texas,

2400
01:43:42,790 --> 01:43:43,623
you could shoot him.
And it was justifiable homicide until 

2401
01:43:46,601 --> 01:43:50,110
1970 isn't really only 70.
I thought it was really recent.

2402
01:43:50,260 --> 01:43:50,820
Well,
I may,

2403
01:43:50,820 --> 01:43:51,750
I mean that was,
that's,

2404
01:43:51,780 --> 01:43:52,810
that's my recollection,
but

2405
01:43:53,110 --> 01:43:57,810
I think that might still be a law.
There's a,

2406
01:43:57,811 --> 01:44:00,780
isn't there like a crime of passion law 
in Texas?

2407
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:03,090
I feel like there is for some reason,

2408
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:05,800
well they may have just moved,
moved the name or something.

2409
01:44:05,860 --> 01:44:07,330
I don't know,
maybe I'm wrong,

2410
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:12,190
but I know that people have been 
exonerated because of what,

2411
01:44:12,191 --> 01:44:14,260
you know,
crimes of passion because of like you're

2412
01:44:14,261 --> 01:44:15,700
allowed to get pissed off and shoot 
people.

2413
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:17,860
Here it goes.
Crime of passion,

2414
01:44:17,861 --> 01:44:18,694
legal definition.
There is sometimes called the law of 

2415
01:44:20,831 --> 01:44:24,940
Texas since injuries in that state or 
supposedly lenient to cuckolded lovers.

2416
01:44:25,010 --> 01:44:25,843
I love that expression.
Who reached their own vengeance or 

2417
01:44:28,781 --> 01:44:32,290
rector on vengeance.
The benefit of eliminating premeditation

2418
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:33,153
is to lessen the provable homicide to 
manslaughter with no death penalty and 

2419
01:44:36,551 --> 01:44:40,240
limited prison terms.
So that's crimes of passion.

2420
01:44:40,241 --> 01:44:45,241
So it's not legal,
but it's a much lesser crime.

2421
01:44:45,630 --> 01:44:47,070
Well,
I think until [inaudible] 70,

2422
01:44:47,071 --> 01:44:49,600
it was actually just straight up 
justifiable homicide,

2423
01:44:49,601 --> 01:44:50,434
so it was like straight up illegal crime
of passion and now it's like a homicide 

2424
01:44:53,690 --> 01:44:55,890
or manslaughter or go to jail for six 
months.

2425
01:44:55,920 --> 01:44:57,180
Yeah.
But when you get out,

2426
01:44:57,900 --> 01:45:01,730
knows the fuck is up basically stay off 
my property.

2427
01:45:01,740 --> 01:45:02,740
Exactly.
Goddammit.

2428
01:45:02,910 --> 01:45:05,280
It's that same psychology that plays 
out.

2429
01:45:05,420 --> 01:45:07,650
Um,
and so Nesbitt and you know,

2430
01:45:07,810 --> 01:45:09,540
by,
by contrast in the north,

2431
01:45:09,570 --> 01:45:12,540
there are a lot of what are called.
There are more seven slash 11 murders,

2432
01:45:12,750 --> 01:45:15,240
which are basically murders or 
instrumental murders,

2433
01:45:15,241 --> 01:45:17,640
which is where people kill people trying
to get cash,

2434
01:45:17,641 --> 01:45:18,720
right?
They're trying to get rich,

2435
01:45:18,750 --> 01:45:19,770
right?
Um,

2436
01:45:19,771 --> 01:45:21,030
so there are these different.
It's,

2437
01:45:21,060 --> 01:45:22,740
you know,
there's homicide in both places,

2438
01:45:22,741 --> 01:45:25,170
but there are different types of 
homicides that predominate.

2439
01:45:25,530 --> 01:45:27,420
And Nesbitt essentially,
you know,

2440
01:45:27,421 --> 01:45:28,254
the,
the big thing was to figure out why is 

2441
01:45:29,851 --> 01:45:31,080
that true,
right?

2442
01:45:31,350 --> 01:45:35,370
And the answer is that it's this culture
of honor that comes out of hurting.

2443
01:45:35,430 --> 01:45:36,263
And so the irony is,
is that southerners who very often are 

2444
01:45:39,301 --> 01:45:43,560
the ones who feel most strongly about 
how problematic Muslims are,

2445
01:45:43,860 --> 01:45:48,270
have the same culture.
And honor killings,

2446
01:45:48,271 --> 01:45:51,330
and they do all these sorts of things,
but they don't do it to the same extent.

2447
01:45:51,750 --> 01:45:52,800
No,
because in general,

2448
01:45:52,801 --> 01:45:54,680
America is much less violent place,
right?

2449
01:45:54,730 --> 01:45:58,890
So much more violent than they would be 
forced to adapt to the new culture.

2450
01:45:58,891 --> 01:46:00,780
That's right.
Which is mad max style.

2451
01:46:00,810 --> 01:46:01,643
That's right.
And what would happen to all the 

2452
01:46:02,161 --> 01:46:06,510
liberals and when your resources are 
extremely limited,

2453
01:46:06,511 --> 01:46:07,344
like you live in a fucking desert,
you're forced to become even more 

2454
01:46:10,621 --> 01:46:11,580
vicious.
That's right.

2455
01:46:11,581 --> 01:46:14,670
You are protecting your boundaries and 
your property and your resources.

2456
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:15,713
Yep.

2457
01:46:18,070 --> 01:46:18,903
Again,
how do we straighten out the African 

2458
01:46:20,470 --> 01:46:21,240
American

2459
01:46:21,240 --> 01:46:22,680
and that's the point.
It's about profit

2460
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:27,290
with crime and violence and terrible 
atmosphere that they have to imitate.

2461
01:46:27,580 --> 01:46:28,710
Well,
that's the point is,

2462
01:46:28,711 --> 01:46:29,544
is that the thing that allows people to 
move past their cultural baggage is 

2463
01:46:32,411 --> 01:46:33,244
understanding their cultural baggage.
So it's that answer of why it's 

2464
01:46:36,101 --> 01:46:36,934
storytelling.
I did this in this environment because 

2465
01:46:40,331 --> 01:46:43,180
it made sense.
We are no longer in that environment.

2466
01:46:43,181 --> 01:46:46,600
Now it is problematic to me.
Therefore it screws me up.

2467
01:46:46,780 --> 01:46:50,910
So now I should behave in this.
And then you can start to retrain.

2468
01:46:50,911 --> 01:46:54,300
What your impulses are,
so somebody bumps you,

2469
01:46:54,330 --> 01:46:55,163
you know,
somebody comes on your land and your 

2470
01:46:56,461 --> 01:46:59,370
first impulse is not to go grab your 
shotgun and kill them.

2471
01:46:59,430 --> 01:47:00,263
Right?
And you don't worry so much of what it 

2472
01:47:01,591 --> 01:47:04,260
comes down to because it's crucially 
like their honor killings.

2473
01:47:04,261 --> 01:47:05,094
Right?
So those cultures are obsessed with 

2474
01:47:06,750 --> 01:47:07,583
honor and purge for particular.
What you hear with African Americans is 

2475
01:47:10,021 --> 01:47:12,030
don't dismiss,
don't disrespect me,

2476
01:47:12,070 --> 01:47:12,903
right?
So there's a real policing of one's 

2477
01:47:15,001 --> 01:47:18,360
honor and really making sure that nobody
is fucking with me.

2478
01:47:18,361 --> 01:47:19,730
And it's the same thing with,
you know,

2479
01:47:19,770 --> 01:47:21,210
white rednecks,
white southerners,

2480
01:47:21,211 --> 01:47:23,040
right?
That's right.

2481
01:47:23,070 --> 01:47:26,250
Texas pride don't mess with Texas.
Um,

2482
01:47:26,580 --> 01:47:27,413
nobody says Delaware pride.
Well that's because if you've been to 

2483
01:47:30,451 --> 01:47:31,284
Delaware there,

2484
01:47:31,700 --> 01:47:34,090
Maine,
Maine Pride,

2485
01:47:34,091 --> 01:47:37,780
all the dude love Maine.
Those fucking poor do trapped up there.

2486
01:47:37,970 --> 01:47:38,900
Frozen wasteland

2487
01:47:39,260 --> 01:47:42,290
with blueberries and lobster and Steven 
King and Steven King.

2488
01:47:42,291 --> 01:47:43,220
Yeah.
God bless him.

2489
01:47:43,970 --> 01:47:47,120
He's up there for the summer,
summer and winters in Florida.

2490
01:47:48,260 --> 01:47:49,600
Snowbird.
Yeah.

2491
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:51,980
Um,
it's uh,

2492
01:47:52,280 --> 01:47:53,300
in many ways,

2493
01:47:54,200 --> 01:47:56,510
bad to not talk about this.
Right?

2494
01:47:56,511 --> 01:47:57,344
So that is people that have the issue 
with even discussing the origins of 

2495
01:48:00,951 --> 01:48:01,784
certain types of behavior and comparing 
different types of black people and 

2496
01:48:04,821 --> 01:48:05,654
different types of African Americans 
trying to figure out or African former 

2497
01:48:08,631 --> 01:48:09,464
slaves like why did the people in the 
West indies behave differently than the 

2498
01:48:11,661 --> 01:48:12,494
people in America and you know,
it opens up this weird can of worms 

2499
01:48:15,351 --> 01:48:19,550
where people are not willing to discuss 
it openly and that's taboo

2500
01:48:19,650 --> 01:48:23,040
and that is why so called his book black
redneck white liberals.

2501
01:48:23,490 --> 01:48:24,323
Because the problem is that because 
white liberals are not willing to 

2502
01:48:26,431 --> 01:48:27,264
discuss these things,
what ends up happening is that you get 

2503
01:48:29,970 --> 01:48:31,520
African pride,
right?

2504
01:48:31,720 --> 01:48:34,020
It's and you know,
as Solo points out,

2505
01:48:34,021 --> 01:48:36,030
right?
When was pride ever a good thing?

2506
01:48:36,270 --> 01:48:38,240
Right?
Pride is the feeling of that.

2507
01:48:38,250 --> 01:48:40,650
You know it all,
that you have nothing to learn.

2508
01:48:40,651 --> 01:48:42,270
Right.
It's that feeling of arrogance

2509
01:48:42,570 --> 01:48:46,550
or just have to be from mother fucker.
Exactly.

2510
01:48:46,770 --> 01:48:50,080
You wouldn't know about all that live in
your daydreams.

2511
01:48:51,330 --> 01:48:55,240
England when you're a little shit.
He lived here.

2512
01:48:55,260 --> 01:48:56,220
18 in England,
right?

2513
01:48:56,280 --> 01:48:58,790
Yeah.
It's a problem and it is a problem.

2514
01:48:58,850 --> 01:49:01,010
There's just can't be trusted.
That's a lot of culture.

2515
01:49:01,940 --> 01:49:03,820
They got you.
What the.

2516
01:49:03,880 --> 01:49:06,170
What would the.
We know the Siberian candidate.

2517
01:49:06,190 --> 01:49:08,660
What's Siberian tangible people are 
saying,

2518
01:49:08,661 --> 01:49:10,670
Donald Trump is the Siberian candidate 
because.

2519
01:49:12,980 --> 01:49:13,813
Yeah.
What do you think about this whole 

2520
01:49:14,421 --> 01:49:15,254
situation with Russia today?
Because it seems like that poor country 

2521
01:49:18,261 --> 01:49:22,100
doesn't know how to fucking get rid of 
that one guy who's their main dude.

2522
01:49:22,101 --> 01:49:24,830
As much as Garry Kasparov talks about 
and look at that hair.

2523
01:49:24,890 --> 01:49:27,630
That is wonderful.
What the hell is going on there?

2524
01:49:27,860 --> 01:49:31,700
Intel chiefs present trump with claims 
of Russian efforts to compromise.

2525
01:49:31,701 --> 01:49:32,930
Yeah.
Whoa.

2526
01:49:32,931 --> 01:49:35,990
Around this afternoon,
like breaking news sort of thing.

2527
01:49:35,991 --> 01:49:39,620
I don't know how.
Breaking a Russian efforts to compromise

2528
01:49:39,621 --> 01:49:41,420
him while they're playing to his ego.
Oh

2529
01:49:42,680 --> 01:49:45,020
Wow.
Look at his eyebrows.

2530
01:49:45,050 --> 01:49:47,890
Did you read the thing by?
Hold on a second.

2531
01:49:47,891 --> 01:49:48,130
Scroll

2532
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:49,560
back up to that picture.
Tell me that.

2533
01:49:49,561 --> 01:49:53,080
It's not a Dr Seuss character.
That's the Mayor of Louisville.

2534
01:49:54,340 --> 01:49:57,070
That is the fucking mayor of Louisville.
I mean,

2535
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:00,280
the whole thing is just what's happening
here.

2536
01:50:00,790 --> 01:50:04,510
What is all that?
Wow.

2537
01:50:05,410 --> 01:50:08,320
So they're presenting him.
I wonder what he's going to do about all

2538
01:50:08,321 --> 01:50:09,154
that,
including allegations that Russian 

2539
01:50:10,781 --> 01:50:14,560
operatives claimed to have compromising 
personal and financial information about

2540
01:50:14,561 --> 01:50:15,190
Mr.
Trump,

2541
01:50:15,190 --> 01:50:19,980
multiple US officials with direct 
knowledge of the briefly tell CNN hm.

2542
01:50:20,500 --> 01:50:21,333
The allegations were presented in a two 
page synopsis that was at bended to 

2543
01:50:24,941 --> 01:50:27,940
report on Russian intelligence,
the 2016 election.

2544
01:50:28,330 --> 01:50:29,163
The allegations came in part from memos 
compiled by former British intelligence 

2545
01:50:32,411 --> 01:50:35,530
operative who was past work,
US intelligence,

2546
01:50:35,610 --> 01:50:36,443
Fisher officials or officials consider 
credible the FBI's investigating the 

2547
01:50:39,701 --> 01:50:44,350
credibility and accuracy of these 
allegations which are based primarily on

2548
01:50:44,530 --> 01:50:47,590
information from Russian sources but has
not confirmed.

2549
01:50:47,591 --> 01:50:50,290
This is a weird time and it is a very 
weird time.

2550
01:50:50,470 --> 01:50:54,280
So fucking so crazy to think that we're 
in a cold war again.

2551
01:50:54,281 --> 01:50:56,560
Like how did we.
We duct that forever.

2552
01:50:56,770 --> 01:50:57,603
Like to the whole Clinton administration
that was a nonissue through the entire 

2553
01:51:00,191 --> 01:51:01,024
Bush administration.
Non Issue through the entire Obama 

2554
01:51:03,431 --> 01:51:07,210
administration non fuck an issue until 
2012 ish.

2555
01:51:07,720 --> 01:51:09,160
And then he started hearing about it 
again.

2556
01:51:09,560 --> 01:51:11,250
Well,
a large part of what's happened is,

2557
01:51:11,251 --> 01:51:14,120
is that our environment has changed,
but our culture has not.

2558
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:17,420
So if you look at in the 19 fifties,
right,

2559
01:51:17,421 --> 01:51:19,250
if you're talking about the marketplace 
of ideas,

2560
01:51:19,251 --> 01:51:22,670
you had these guys like Ed Rowe,
Edward Armaro and Walter Cronkite,

2561
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:24,860
and they had a thing called journalistic
integrity,

2562
01:51:25,010 --> 01:51:29,530
right?
And Brian Williams and Williams.

2563
01:51:30,370 --> 01:51:31,071
Yeah.
That guy,

2564
01:51:31,071 --> 01:51:33,120
he's,
he's just as good as any of them.

2565
01:51:34,220 --> 01:51:36,170
That guy can tell a good story.
Yeah,

2566
01:51:36,171 --> 01:51:37,600
exactly.
Um,

2567
01:51:37,730 --> 01:51:40,610
but journalistic integrity is now don 
lemon.

2568
01:51:40,730 --> 01:51:42,590
Don Lemon.
Step back,

2569
01:51:44,730 --> 01:51:47,140
step back and respect him.
A set of check.

2570
01:51:47,270 --> 01:51:48,380
People.
I don't know if you know.

2571
01:51:48,530 --> 01:51:49,350
No

2572
01:51:49,350 --> 01:51:53,000
Czech people had it.
One of my favorite things.

2573
01:51:53,030 --> 01:51:56,020
Do you ever said on tv?
Someone was talking about something?

2574
01:51:56,050 --> 01:51:57,970
It was something about.
I don't remember what it was.

2575
01:51:57,971 --> 01:51:58,804
What was it?
When don lemon was saying he had to 

2576
01:52:00,791 --> 01:52:01,624
check.
People had to check some people in my 

2577
01:52:02,351 --> 01:52:03,184
life.
It was like people talk to talking 

2578
01:52:05,231 --> 01:52:07,750
sexist or something like that.
And he was just telling people he had to

2579
01:52:07,751 --> 01:52:09,940
check people in his life.
Shut the fuck up.

2580
01:52:09,941 --> 01:52:11,460
Don Lemon.
You check checking anybody,

2581
01:52:12,610 --> 01:52:14,470
anybody you'd check tells you to shut 
your mouth.

2582
01:52:15,010 --> 01:52:15,843
What's the funny part is I guess 
something in this report that just came 

2583
01:52:18,881 --> 01:52:20,470
out,
which is also going around now.

2584
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:22,330
I'll let you go ahead and read this 
report.

2585
01:52:22,331 --> 01:52:23,164
Trump allegedly hired prostitutes for a 
golden shower party on Ritz Moscow bed 

2586
01:52:27,701 --> 01:52:29,410
were Obama.
Michelle slept.

2587
01:52:30,550 --> 01:52:32,450
This is right out of the report.
This highlighted.

2588
01:52:33,220 --> 01:52:34,200
Okay.
Here's.

2589
01:52:34,260 --> 01:52:37,030
There were aspects of trump's engagement
with Russian authorities,

2590
01:52:37,031 --> 01:52:39,370
one which had borne fruit to them,
was exploited.

2591
01:52:39,400 --> 01:52:40,233
Trump's personal obsessions with sexual 
perversion in order to obtain the 

2592
01:52:43,151 --> 01:52:46,520
sustainable kompromat compromising 
material

2593
01:52:46,520 --> 01:52:49,970
on him according to source diy where,
uh,

2594
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:55,000
where s he had been president trump's 
perverted in Britain,

2595
01:52:55,770 --> 01:52:56,603
brackets conduct in Moscow included 
hiring the presidential suite of the 

2596
01:53:03,050 --> 01:53:04,760
Ritz Carlton Hotel where he knew 
president and Mrs Obama,

2597
01:53:05,090 --> 01:53:05,923
whom he hated in parenthesis,
had stayed on one of their official 

2598
01:53:09,861 --> 01:53:10,694
trips to Russia and defiling the bed 
where they had slept by employing a 

2599
01:53:14,241 --> 01:53:16,580
number of prostitutes,
performed golden showers,

2600
01:53:16,910 --> 01:53:18,560
urination,
show in front of him.

2601
01:53:19,380 --> 01:53:20,213
Hm.
The hotel was known to be under FSB 

2602
01:53:22,191 --> 01:53:26,660
control with microphones and concealed 
cameras and all the main rooms to record

2603
01:53:26,661 --> 01:53:28,970
anything they wanted to.
Holy Shit.

2604
01:53:29,210 --> 01:53:32,720
They just go to the Ritz Carlton and 
they set up microphones and cameras.

2605
01:53:32,850 --> 01:53:34,200
Oh yeah.
That's the Russian way.

2606
01:53:35,030 --> 01:53:36,960
All the Ritz Carlton.
Oh yeah.

2607
01:53:37,080 --> 01:53:39,180
That's crazy.
But that's the nature.

2608
01:53:39,181 --> 01:53:40,014
I mean,
you know,

2609
01:53:40,230 --> 01:53:43,170
you jerk off for the Ritz Carlton,
what do you put a blanket over?

2610
01:53:43,590 --> 01:53:46,350
Where do you.
A fucking camera.

2611
01:53:46,470 --> 01:53:47,303
You'd have to put a.
you'd have to put a blanket over 

2612
01:53:48,421 --> 01:53:50,880
everything because there are going to be
a lot of cameras in that room.

2613
01:53:51,040 --> 01:53:51,873
My friend Mike,
but Mike Swick who is a former UFC 

2614
01:53:53,971 --> 01:53:54,804
fighter,
worked in Russia with the American 

2615
01:53:56,821 --> 01:53:57,654
secret service a long time ago and he 
said that they found these listening 

2616
01:54:00,571 --> 01:54:01,404
devices,

2617
01:54:01,850 --> 01:54:02,683
it hidden inside buildings that were 
powered by the movement of the building 

2618
01:54:06,501 --> 01:54:10,970
during the wind,
like what they have their own.

2619
01:54:11,360 --> 01:54:14,660
Their power source is literally the 
building moving in.

2620
01:54:14,661 --> 01:54:15,494
The wind was.
He said it was so far beyond anything 

2621
01:54:17,750 --> 01:54:18,583
that they had ever figured out that the 
Americans had figured out at the time 

2622
01:54:21,410 --> 01:54:23,210
and they were just all about 
surveillance.

2623
01:54:23,400 --> 01:54:25,890
Well that was the things that the Soviet
Union did well.

2624
01:54:25,950 --> 01:54:26,870
Right.
Like they,

2625
01:54:26,910 --> 01:54:27,743
they.
There were a few things in the Soviet 

2626
01:54:28,860 --> 01:54:33,150
Union really put their attention on like
space and surveillance and you know,

2627
01:54:33,151 --> 01:54:33,984
espionage and all of that sort of stuff 
in the military and they did those very 

2628
01:54:37,111 --> 01:54:39,630
well.
Sounds like horseshit to me.

2629
01:54:39,930 --> 01:54:40,763
That sounds like something somebody 
would say if you're trying to emote is 

2630
01:54:43,531 --> 01:54:44,364
from buzzfeed,
but it sounds like something someone 

2631
01:54:46,021 --> 01:54:47,790
would say,
but the quote is not though.

2632
01:54:47,791 --> 01:54:49,340
Right.
Where's the quote from the quote?

2633
01:54:50,200 --> 01:54:52,580
The quote is from the story was from 
buzzfeed from,

2634
01:54:52,660 --> 01:54:53,493
but that's just the actual report is 
where that was from that report that 

2635
01:54:56,500 --> 01:54:58,540
they were talking about in the previous 
article we brought up.

2636
01:54:58,840 --> 01:54:59,800
Oh,
so it's from the,

2637
01:55:00,140 --> 01:55:01,870
from the Intel.
Oh,

2638
01:55:01,950 --> 01:55:04,410
shut the CIA.
Australia.

2639
01:55:04,460 --> 01:55:06,960
The thing here,
this is the report here.

2640
01:55:07,500 --> 01:55:07,950
It's like a,

2641
01:55:07,950 --> 01:55:09,860
the company intelligence report.
Yeah.

2642
01:55:09,870 --> 01:55:11,550
It's a long report.
Presidential.

2643
01:55:11,551 --> 01:55:12,420
Hold on,
sorry.

2644
01:55:12,480 --> 01:55:14,880
Go back up there,
certain US presidential election,

2645
01:55:14,881 --> 01:55:16,800
Republican Kennedy,
Donald Trump's activity in Russia,

2646
01:55:16,801 --> 01:55:18,690
and compromising relationship with the 
Kremlin.

2647
01:55:18,930 --> 01:55:19,763
Wow.

2648
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:23,450
A long pages and this right here.
So now,

2649
01:55:23,690 --> 01:55:25,750
now we have to talk about golden showers
apparent,

2650
01:55:25,770 --> 01:55:26,603
but here's the thing.

2651
01:55:28,170 --> 01:55:29,150
We know.
Yeah,

2652
01:55:29,180 --> 01:55:30,013
okay.
We know we've always known that 

2653
01:55:31,111 --> 01:55:34,560
intelligence agencies will distribute 
propaganda.

2654
01:55:34,830 --> 01:55:37,230
We know that that's 100 percent factual,

2655
01:55:37,500 --> 01:55:40,650
but that's the problem and that's the 
problem in general is this,

2656
01:55:40,651 --> 01:55:41,484
that like you know that the CIA engages 
that sort of behavior and of course you 

2657
01:55:44,881 --> 01:55:48,030
know that the FSB,
the Russian security services engages in

2658
01:55:48,031 --> 01:55:49,380
that behavior.
Of course,

2659
01:55:49,440 --> 01:55:51,240
who do you trust?
Do you trust?

2660
01:55:51,390 --> 01:55:54,510
And that's the basic problem of 2017,
2016,

2661
01:55:54,511 --> 01:55:56,540
100 percent who the trust.

2662
01:55:57,390 --> 01:55:58,223
You got to know that if the,
if someone from any agency is telling 

2663
01:56:03,061 --> 01:56:05,940
you something and why,
what,

2664
01:56:06,240 --> 01:56:09,090
what,
what would it serve them to tell you 100

2665
01:56:09,091 --> 01:56:12,990
percent the truth without any 
manipulation whatsoever in order to gain

2666
01:56:12,991 --> 01:56:15,600
favor in order to gain influence in 
order to gain.

2667
01:56:16,010 --> 01:56:19,110
And what what,
what would the CIA have?

2668
01:56:19,111 --> 01:56:21,780
Any motivation to be 100 percent 
accurate about it?

2669
01:56:21,810 --> 01:56:22,300
Why?

2670
01:56:22,300 --> 01:56:23,140
Well,
I mean,

2671
01:56:23,200 --> 01:56:24,880
you know,
I mean the CIA,

2672
01:56:24,881 --> 01:56:28,060
obviously Donald Trump is not clearly a 
friend to the CIA.

2673
01:56:28,240 --> 01:56:29,073
Right.
He's already made it clear that he has 

2674
01:56:29,951 --> 01:56:30,784
issues with the intelligence community.
So it sounds so crazy because he's not 

2675
01:56:34,241 --> 01:56:35,240
even in there yet.
Nope.

2676
01:56:35,340 --> 01:56:36,173
And he hasn't been briefed by them and 
he's been rejecting that and I mean 

2677
01:56:39,371 --> 01:56:40,880
that's the point we live in.
You know,

2678
01:56:40,900 --> 01:56:43,570
the old Chinese curse,
we live in interesting times.

2679
01:56:43,720 --> 01:56:46,390
I'll tell you one thing though,
when if he,

2680
01:56:46,510 --> 01:56:50,650
if it comes out that there was a bunch 
of girls that he hired the piss all over

2681
01:56:50,651 --> 01:56:51,484
the bed,
people are going to cheer him on the 

2682
01:56:52,451 --> 01:56:53,284
streets where people will.
There's people that loved them in the 

2683
01:56:56,261 --> 01:56:58,120
first place and that's going to be a ton
of them.

2684
01:56:58,121 --> 01:57:00,370
They're going to care as the guy had a 
good time.

2685
01:57:00,490 --> 01:57:01,630
Yep.
And that's,

2686
01:57:01,810 --> 01:57:03,220
that's because again,
it's clan,

2687
01:57:03,310 --> 01:57:04,001
it's,
you know,

2688
01:57:04,001 --> 01:57:04,834
it is that culture of authority and 
grouping around and being loyal and all 

2689
01:57:07,961 --> 01:57:09,490
that sort of stuff.
Of course.

2690
01:57:09,580 --> 01:57:12,010
And those,
those are the big sort of conservative,

2691
01:57:12,040 --> 01:57:14,650
you know,
a hillbilly redneck intuitions,

2692
01:57:14,680 --> 01:57:16,480
right?
As opposed to liberals are like,

2693
01:57:16,481 --> 01:57:18,880
let's care for everybody.
Like that's amazing,

2694
01:57:18,881 --> 01:57:19,714
let's not hurt anyone's feelings and 
let's have trophies for participation 

2695
01:57:22,121 --> 01:57:23,980
and all that sort of stuff.
And so for a long time,

2696
01:57:24,370 --> 01:57:25,203
you know,
the liberals have had a lot of power 

2697
01:57:26,261 --> 01:57:28,570
over the media and politics and all that
sort of stuff.

2698
01:57:28,571 --> 01:57:32,620
And so that's the rabbit hole that the 
country went down and now you know,

2699
01:57:32,621 --> 01:57:34,190
the Conservatives have sort of,
you know,

2700
01:57:34,210 --> 01:57:36,880
gotten pissed off and you know,
have,

2701
01:57:36,910 --> 01:57:38,160
you know,
it's sort of like,

2702
01:57:38,170 --> 01:57:39,910
I mean,
in the ideal situation,

2703
01:57:40,210 --> 01:57:43,000
the Republicans,
the Democrats work like Mommy and Daddy,

2704
01:57:43,180 --> 01:57:43,810
right?

2705
01:57:43,810 --> 01:57:44,643
And you know,
it's not that mommy and daddy have it 

2706
01:57:46,571 --> 01:57:49,330
all figured out,
but if mommy and daddy have a productive

2707
01:57:49,331 --> 01:57:50,164
working relationship than the,
than the sort of like take personal 

2708
01:57:53,261 --> 01:57:54,550
responsibility,
you know,

2709
01:57:54,551 --> 01:57:55,384
man up,
like do all these sorts of things is 

2710
01:57:56,951 --> 01:58:00,790
counteracted by a certain understanding,
compassion and all that sort of stuff.

2711
01:58:00,970 --> 01:58:01,803
And then the parenting that emerges is 
better than what they would either of 

2712
01:58:04,091 --> 01:58:09,091
them would do on their own or they can 
both get dysfunctional as fuck and mommy

2713
01:58:09,191 --> 01:58:10,900
becomes an enabling,
you know,

2714
01:58:10,901 --> 01:58:13,070
snowflake machine,
right?

2715
01:58:14,200 --> 01:58:15,033
Daddy just becomes an abusive asshole 
who won't pay child support and just 

2716
01:58:17,531 --> 01:58:20,380
berates his children and is like,
what the fuck is wrong with you?

2717
01:58:20,381 --> 01:58:22,750
Grow the fuck up on,
come on pussy.

2718
01:58:23,050 --> 01:58:26,500
And so that's really where America is.
His Mommy and daddy are fighting.

2719
01:58:28,370 --> 01:58:29,203
And fundamentally like Mommy and daddy 
are having the most dysfunctional 

2720
01:58:32,381 --> 01:58:32,950
relationship.

2721
01:58:32,950 --> 01:58:35,710
Possible rushes are crazy neighbor who 
was like,

2722
01:58:35,711 --> 01:58:37,900
what a great opportunity to come in and 
fuck mommy.

2723
01:58:38,060 --> 01:58:39,670
Right?
Wow.

2724
01:58:39,700 --> 01:58:44,320
Russia trying to fart mom.
I can't believe this nonsense.

2725
01:58:44,740 --> 01:58:45,573
But it's also,
it's good for Putin because what does 

2726
01:58:46,931 --> 01:58:47,764
the Godfather want the godfather the.
So I think it's important to understand 

2727
01:58:51,731 --> 01:58:54,790
like the disaster of American foreign 
policy.

2728
01:58:54,791 --> 01:58:56,140
What is that about?
Right?

2729
01:58:56,200 --> 01:59:00,160
And it's because modern Americans have 
grown up in,

2730
01:59:00,190 --> 01:59:02,190
you know,
essentially the most successful,

2731
01:59:02,200 --> 01:59:04,480
most productive,
most stable country in history.

2732
01:59:04,540 --> 01:59:05,710
Right?
Um,

2733
01:59:05,800 --> 01:59:06,670
and so,
you know,

2734
01:59:06,671 --> 01:59:07,570
if you're,
you know,

2735
01:59:07,660 --> 01:59:10,300
as many generations into democracy as 
you are,

2736
01:59:10,600 --> 01:59:14,080
there's not a real understanding of how 
you get to democracy,

2737
01:59:14,320 --> 01:59:15,153
right?
We just sort of inherited democracy and 

2738
01:59:16,631 --> 01:59:17,200
we're like,
man,

2739
01:59:17,200 --> 01:59:18,033
I don't know how he make one and then 
you get these ridiculous fables that 

2740
01:59:20,681 --> 01:59:25,681
Americans have about themselves where 
they think that I'm essentially,

2741
01:59:26,141 --> 01:59:27,040
you know,
King George,

2742
01:59:27,041 --> 01:59:30,910
the third was this awful vicious 
dictator and then we kicked the dictator

2743
01:59:30,911 --> 01:59:32,320
out and then democracy.

2744
01:59:32,680 --> 01:59:33,513
And so that's all you have to do is you 
have to go in and you have to remove 

2745
01:59:35,951 --> 01:59:36,784
dictators.
And if we just keep removing dictators 

2746
01:59:38,261 --> 01:59:40,120
than democracy will emerge.
Well,

2747
01:59:40,121 --> 01:59:42,790
what happens when you remove Saddam 
Hussein vacuum?

2748
01:59:42,791 --> 01:59:44,740
Yeah.
Fills up with,

2749
01:59:45,020 --> 01:59:47,470
I said,
isn't that delicious?

2750
01:59:47,570 --> 01:59:49,070
Right?
Or you know,

2751
01:59:49,090 --> 01:59:50,710
you remove Kadafi,
right?

2752
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:53,670
What happens vacuum.
Yeah.

2753
01:59:53,860 --> 01:59:56,140
And then what happens?
I says,

2754
01:59:56,320 --> 01:59:58,090
al Qaeda,
all these sorts of things.

2755
01:59:58,360 --> 01:59:59,950
So that,
the big question that you know,

2756
02:00:00,130 --> 02:00:00,963
that has always been in political 
science and that Francis Fukuyama for 

2757
02:00:03,340 --> 02:00:04,121
frames,
this is that.

2758
02:00:04,121 --> 02:00:04,954
It's always been what it,
why is it that the American revolution 

2759
02:00:07,691 --> 02:00:10,810
succeeded?
And the French revolution descended into

2760
02:00:10,811 --> 02:00:13,380
bloody violence.
And the answer is,

2761
02:00:13,381 --> 02:00:16,750
is that they were actually at two 
different stages of development.

2762
02:00:17,480 --> 02:00:22,480
Incorrect answer is America.
America and French are bunch of pussies.

2763
02:00:25,680 --> 02:00:27,040
Exactly.
That is correct.

2764
02:00:27,070 --> 02:00:30,460
That's freedom.
Fries and fries.

2765
02:00:30,520 --> 02:00:32,430
Kick back and relax.
Um,

2766
02:00:32,710 --> 02:00:33,880
yeah.
So that's actually the answer.

2767
02:00:33,881 --> 02:00:36,250
And I'm sorry I take back everything 
that I said earlier.

2768
02:00:36,510 --> 02:00:39,500
It is the blaming of,
you know,

2769
02:00:40,040 --> 02:00:40,873
not necessarily blaming,
but understanding the root of the 

2770
02:00:42,841 --> 02:00:43,674
behavior as being cultural and that we 
have these ideologies that we become 

2771
02:00:49,861 --> 02:00:53,290
imprisoned to patterns of behavior,
that we become prison too,

2772
02:00:53,730 --> 02:00:54,563
and that we're all subject to it.
Anyone with an accent understands that 

2773
02:00:57,511 --> 02:00:59,910
this is where it comes from,
that we imitate behavior,

2774
02:00:59,911 --> 02:01:00,744
that it's around us.
And if we're in around an area like we 

2775
02:01:02,591 --> 02:01:07,410
were talking about the Middle East with 
poor resources and scarcity and a lot of

2776
02:01:07,411 --> 02:01:08,244
violence,
this is the type of behavior that we're 

2777
02:01:09,631 --> 02:01:11,250
going to.
We're going to control our women,

2778
02:01:11,280 --> 02:01:13,200
dress them up,
cover them up like beekeepers.

2779
02:01:13,380 --> 02:01:14,213
We got to keep them,
keep them away from the other swinging 

2780
02:01:15,301 --> 02:01:16,134
dicks that's fucking assholes that are 
going to come over the hill with the 

2781
02:01:18,130 --> 02:01:19,500
sores and the horses.
That's right.

2782
02:01:19,501 --> 02:01:20,940
Because that's what's been going on 
forever.

2783
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:21,751
Exactly.
I mean,

2784
02:01:21,751 --> 02:01:22,584
if you look at Iraq,
one of the craziest stories about Iraq 

2785
02:01:24,121 --> 02:01:24,954
was a rackspace with Baghdad being 
invaded by the Mongols and then killing 

2786
02:01:29,071 --> 02:01:34,071
everybody and running the streets raw 
red with blood and black with ink in the

2787
02:01:34,831 --> 02:01:35,664
rivers would fucking be filled with the 
philosophy and all the from all these 

2788
02:01:40,550 --> 02:01:43,580
Islamic theorists and all these 
different,

2789
02:01:43,581 --> 02:01:48,230
um,
different scholars who were far ahead of

2790
02:01:48,231 --> 02:01:51,230
that aspect of the world,
the rest of the part of the world at the

2791
02:01:51,231 --> 02:01:52,130
time.
That's right.

2792
02:01:52,131 --> 02:01:53,810
I mean,
so much mathematics,

2793
02:01:53,811 --> 02:01:55,720
so much philosophy.
So,

2794
02:01:55,910 --> 02:01:57,830
so much knowledge came from that part of
the world.

2795
02:01:57,860 --> 02:02:00,170
It was totally lost when they were 
invaded.

2796
02:02:00,460 --> 02:02:02,080
And so much of it is that,
you know,

2797
02:02:02,081 --> 02:02:02,770
the,
the old,

2798
02:02:02,770 --> 02:02:03,603
there's an old quote that floats around,
which is that if Nobel prizes had been 

2799
02:02:06,461 --> 02:02:09,550
given out in the year 1000,
they all would have gone to Arabs.

2800
02:02:10,530 --> 02:02:12,520
Amazing it,
they were at the forefront and the point

2801
02:02:12,521 --> 02:02:13,354
is,
is that tells you something which is 

2802
02:02:14,230 --> 02:02:16,330
that success is not a permanent 
condition.

2803
02:02:16,540 --> 02:02:17,373
Bright cultures can gain it and cultures
can lose it and you better figure out 

2804
02:02:21,011 --> 02:02:21,844
what is it that makes a culture 
successful so you can preserve those 

2805
02:02:24,311 --> 02:02:25,870
values,
fight for those values,

2806
02:02:25,871 --> 02:02:27,100
instilled them,
spread them,

2807
02:02:27,101 --> 02:02:28,150
all that sort of stuff.

2808
02:02:28,320 --> 02:02:32,670
And that's why poop is jockeying for 
power because he believes that there's a

2809
02:02:32,671 --> 02:02:36,660
turnover going on right now and they 
just hired a fucking reality star to run

2810
02:02:36,661 --> 02:02:39,000
the biggest nuclear arsenal in the world
has ever known.

2811
02:02:39,270 --> 02:02:41,070
Holy Shit.
This might be the time.

2812
02:02:41,170 --> 02:02:42,550
Yep.
And they're there.

2813
02:02:42,551 --> 02:02:45,150
And that the instability that has been 
created is,

2814
02:02:45,151 --> 02:02:45,984
is that,
you know,

2815
02:02:46,070 --> 02:02:48,850
if you know,
you gave everyone a microphone,

2816
02:02:48,880 --> 02:02:50,240
that's what the Internet is,
right?

2817
02:02:50,500 --> 02:02:52,000
We're literally sitting here,
right?

2818
02:02:52,030 --> 02:02:52,863
And you know,
you can start a show and if people 

2819
02:02:54,581 --> 02:02:56,200
resonate with the show,
great.

2820
02:02:56,560 --> 02:02:57,393
And the point is,
is that there are some people like you 

2821
02:02:59,170 --> 02:03:02,530
who can hold two contradictory ideas in 
their head,

2822
02:03:02,680 --> 02:03:03,513
right?
And you like wrestle with that and 

2823
02:03:05,261 --> 02:03:06,071
you're like,
man,

2824
02:03:06,071 --> 02:03:08,410
how do I make sense of both of these 
things that,

2825
02:03:08,440 --> 02:03:09,273
you know,
capitalism is fundamentally generates 

2826
02:03:11,801 --> 02:03:13,750
wealth and prosperity and all that sort 
of stuff.

2827
02:03:13,810 --> 02:03:16,000
But corporations can do fucked up 
things,

2828
02:03:16,001 --> 02:03:16,834
right?
How do I reconcile those two different 

2829
02:03:17,891 --> 02:03:20,440
things?
And then there's a whole bunch of people

2830
02:03:20,441 --> 02:03:21,274
out there on the Internet who are 
fundamentalists or who offer some sort 

2831
02:03:23,651 --> 02:03:24,484
of very,
very simple narrative that is very easy 

2832
02:03:27,011 --> 02:03:27,844
for people to get and people can go and 
go down the rabbit hole of their 

2833
02:03:31,301 --> 02:03:34,090
prejudices.
They can go down the rabbit hole of,

2834
02:03:34,300 --> 02:03:35,133
you know,
caring and compassion in the end up at 

2835
02:03:36,551 --> 02:03:37,570
Marxism,
right?

2836
02:03:37,770 --> 02:03:41,440
Where people can go down the libertarian
rabbit hole of freedom.

2837
02:03:41,740 --> 02:03:45,490
And so they come up with this idea 
called a narco capitalism and a narco.

2838
02:03:45,491 --> 02:03:46,324
Capitalism is the idea that we're just 
going to remove all government and then 

2839
02:03:49,151 --> 02:03:53,320
the free market will solve all problems.
So there's literally going to be minimal

2840
02:03:53,321 --> 02:03:54,340
or no government.

2841
02:03:54,440 --> 02:03:57,800
They're the most annoying people there 
to me,

2842
02:03:57,820 --> 02:04:00,710
of the most annoying people like you.
You don't know that that's going to fall

2843
02:04:00,711 --> 02:04:01,544
to shit.
You don't know that people aren't going 

2844
02:04:02,191 --> 02:04:03,024
to fix the streets.
Where's the money for education coming 

2845
02:04:04,311 --> 02:04:05,380
from?
Who's going to hire cops?

2846
02:04:05,390 --> 02:04:07,970
Anybody.
No laws at all.

2847
02:04:07,971 --> 02:04:08,870
Shut the fuck up.

2848
02:04:08,870 --> 02:04:09,703
Well,
but what I love particularly and so 

2849
02:04:10,341 --> 02:04:11,080
stupid.
Well,

2850
02:04:11,080 --> 02:04:11,913
I,
I got into a big fight over the 

2851
02:04:13,401 --> 02:04:14,234
Christmas holidays with a group of a 
narco capitalists and it was literally 

2852
02:04:17,511 --> 02:04:18,860
because one of them,
there's this,

2853
02:04:19,490 --> 02:04:21,560
there were two things we interviewed.
There's this guy,

2854
02:04:21,561 --> 02:04:23,310
Peter Schiff,
and Peter Schiff is a liberal.

2855
02:04:23,550 --> 02:04:24,770
Yeah.
So anyway,

2856
02:04:24,771 --> 02:04:27,370
so I interviewed Peter Schiff and we,
you know,

2857
02:04:27,450 --> 02:04:30,710
part of the experience of doing this 
podcast with Brian Kaylin is,

2858
02:04:30,980 --> 02:04:33,620
you know,
we interviewed all these academics,

2859
02:04:33,621 --> 02:04:36,230
right?
Two hundred and six of them.

2860
02:04:36,290 --> 02:04:38,670
Right?
And then at episode two,

2861
02:04:38,671 --> 02:04:39,504
Oh six,
there were two things that we sort of 

2862
02:04:40,741 --> 02:04:41,574
noticed a,
there were all these amazing ideas be 

2863
02:04:44,580 --> 02:04:45,413
you would find that any academic knew 
about his amazing idea and nobody 

2864
02:04:49,420 --> 02:04:50,253
else's.
Like we didn't know about anything else 

2865
02:04:51,451 --> 02:04:53,280
that was going on in science or anything
like that.

2866
02:04:53,281 --> 02:04:56,070
Or like Meryl Streep doesn't understand 
MMA exactly.

2867
02:04:56,420 --> 02:04:58,030
Um,
so it's the Meryl Streep Effect,

2868
02:04:58,080 --> 02:05:01,020
right?
That's an academics are like,

2869
02:05:01,230 --> 02:05:02,063
and it again,
it actually comes out of sort of what 

2870
02:05:03,421 --> 02:05:07,370
the Western cultural biases which is 
towards this thing called atomism write.

2871
02:05:07,400 --> 02:05:10,080
Like scientists are super focused on a 
tiny,

2872
02:05:10,081 --> 02:05:12,630
tiny question.
They don't look for the bigger picture.

2873
02:05:13,050 --> 02:05:16,620
And we reached this frustration where 
essentially we were like,

2874
02:05:16,920 --> 02:05:19,050
these ideas,
you can't,

2875
02:05:19,080 --> 02:05:19,913
you know,
there's an old George Bernard Shaw joke 

2876
02:05:21,481 --> 02:05:22,314
about economists.
He said all the economists laid end to 

2877
02:05:24,271 --> 02:05:25,890
end would never reach a conclusion.

2878
02:05:28,080 --> 02:05:28,913
It's the same thing with academics.
All the academics laid end to end would 

2879
02:05:31,531 --> 02:05:32,364
never reach a conclusion.
There's all this science that piles up 

2880
02:05:34,471 --> 02:05:36,180
all this sort of stuff.
What does it mean?

2881
02:05:36,480 --> 02:05:38,460
Like what should we do?
How should we live our lives?

2882
02:05:38,461 --> 02:05:40,650
How do we solve the problems of people 
in the ghettos?

2883
02:05:40,830 --> 02:05:43,050
How do we solve the problems of the 
people in the Middle East?

2884
02:05:43,200 --> 02:05:44,033
How do we solve,
make liberals have some sort of 

2885
02:05:45,571 --> 02:05:48,270
perspective?
How do we do these things?

2886
02:05:48,540 --> 02:05:51,900
And that's science should turn into 
practical things.

2887
02:05:52,080 --> 02:05:54,060
And in some areas it does,
right?

2888
02:05:54,061 --> 02:05:55,620
So you know,
there's a good sort of,

2889
02:05:55,880 --> 02:05:56,713
you know,
there's physics has this adjacent 

2890
02:05:57,871 --> 02:05:59,370
profession engineering,
right,

2891
02:05:59,371 --> 02:06:02,280
and engineers go and they look at the 
laws of physics and they figured out how

2892
02:06:02,281 --> 02:06:04,740
to engineer quantum computers and all 
this other stuff,

2893
02:06:04,770 --> 02:06:05,603
right?
But when you talk about the human 

2894
02:06:06,751 --> 02:06:07,584
sciences,
the adjacent profession that's supposed 

2895
02:06:09,541 --> 02:06:10,890
to be there as storytelling.

2896
02:06:11,220 --> 02:06:14,370
So there's what's called the science to 
narrative chain where you're supposed to

2897
02:06:14,371 --> 02:06:16,390
take science all of this research and 
supposed to tell it,

2898
02:06:16,460 --> 02:06:19,080
turn it into simple stories that people 
can understand and get,

2899
02:06:19,470 --> 02:06:20,303
and there is in fact,
just to give you a sense of this 

2900
02:06:21,571 --> 02:06:22,404
problem,
like everybody knows that scientists 

2901
02:06:24,210 --> 02:06:25,710
aren't the best communicators,
right?

2902
02:06:25,711 --> 02:06:28,530
Like the ones that are people like Neil 
degrasse Tyson,

2903
02:06:28,590 --> 02:06:29,423
right?
You get on this show because you're 

2904
02:06:30,751 --> 02:06:31,381
like,
man,

2905
02:06:31,381 --> 02:06:33,690
a fucking scientists who can communicate
like a human,

2906
02:06:33,780 --> 02:06:35,640
right or Carl Sagan or.
But,

2907
02:06:35,700 --> 02:06:37,620
you know,
these people are fucking Unicorns,

2908
02:06:37,621 --> 02:06:38,460
right?
They're very,

2909
02:06:38,461 --> 02:06:40,740
very rare in the scientific community.
So,

2910
02:06:40,830 --> 02:06:42,540
um,
I had,

2911
02:06:42,600 --> 02:06:45,150
my very specific experience was I,
I,

2912
02:06:45,210 --> 02:06:48,090
when I graduated from college,
I started tutoring just to pay my bills.

2913
02:06:48,420 --> 02:06:49,253
But I was really trying to figure out,
I had this weird experience where I 

2914
02:06:51,991 --> 02:06:55,140
would be working with kids and I would 
hear them say things like,

2915
02:06:55,170 --> 02:06:56,380
oh,
I didn't get the math gene.

2916
02:06:56,680 --> 02:06:58,860
And I was like,
what the fuck is that matching?

2917
02:06:58,890 --> 02:07:00,660
Because I was a biochemistry major,
so I'm like,

2918
02:07:00,750 --> 02:07:01,583
we met like you're 13 and failing 
biology and you're telling me that you 

2919
02:07:06,751 --> 02:07:07,584
have a math gene.
And I just majored in biochemistry and 

2920
02:07:10,261 --> 02:07:12,240
we don't know about any math gene over 
there.

2921
02:07:12,450 --> 02:07:16,080
So what the fuck are you talking about?
Someone's telling them that some.

2922
02:07:16,150 --> 02:07:18,330
Somehow they're picking that up,
getting this idea.

2923
02:07:18,360 --> 02:07:19,980
That's right.
Limited potential.

2924
02:07:19,981 --> 02:07:24,120
That's right now.
So that was a detective hunt that I went

2925
02:07:24,121 --> 02:07:24,954
on.
I was there is because there's a lot of 

2926
02:07:25,531 --> 02:07:26,364
these things.
I don't have a natural ear for 

2927
02:07:26,941 --> 02:07:27,780
languages.
Right.

2928
02:07:27,781 --> 02:07:30,000
That's another big one we heard and you 
know,

2929
02:07:30,060 --> 02:07:33,000
oh I'm not a natural writer and all 
these sorts of things.

2930
02:07:33,210 --> 02:07:35,740
And I was like,
what are all these fucking beliefs?

2931
02:07:35,800 --> 02:07:37,510
Right.
And I could tell that they were,

2932
02:07:37,600 --> 02:07:41,620
they were problematic and that they were
self defeating and specifically,

2933
02:07:41,980 --> 02:07:42,813
you know,
having moved between all of these 

2934
02:07:43,781 --> 02:07:44,614
cultures,
I'd seen that different cultures have 

2935
02:07:45,911 --> 02:07:47,740
very different ideas about intelligence.

2936
02:07:47,980 --> 02:07:52,120
So especially if you like my mother and 
my father's side by side on the issue of

2937
02:07:52,121 --> 02:07:54,430
learning languages.
My Dad is Dutch.

2938
02:07:54,670 --> 02:07:56,530
Okay.
Now when you're Dutch,

2939
02:07:56,620 --> 02:07:58,540
you grew up with one great certainty in 
life,

2940
02:07:58,870 --> 02:08:01,030
which is that no one will ever fucking 
learn Dutch.

2941
02:08:01,540 --> 02:08:04,930
Like literally no one is ever going to 
fucking learn Dutch.

2942
02:08:05,200 --> 02:08:07,720
So if you want to get a job and you want
to be competitive,

2943
02:08:07,930 --> 02:08:10,750
you better learn literally everybody 
else's fucking language.

2944
02:08:10,960 --> 02:08:14,080
So you know,
it's routine and Holland to speak three,

2945
02:08:14,081 --> 02:08:15,670
four languages.
And you know,

2946
02:08:15,671 --> 02:08:17,350
my dad spoke 10,
right?

2947
02:08:17,351 --> 02:08:19,960
He studied 10 different languages his in
his life.

2948
02:08:20,140 --> 02:08:21,160
That's crazy.
Well,

2949
02:08:21,161 --> 02:08:21,994
and it's,
it's actually there anybody who comes 

2950
02:08:23,321 --> 02:08:25,840
from a lot of these minority languages,
sort of smaller,

2951
02:08:25,841 --> 02:08:28,000
shittier languages,
you find they do this.

2952
02:08:28,001 --> 02:08:30,640
So polls routinely learn a lot of 
languages.

2953
02:08:30,850 --> 02:08:33,550
People from Southeast Asia routinely 
learn a lot of languages.

2954
02:08:33,550 --> 02:08:34,660
And again,
it's that environment,

2955
02:08:34,780 --> 02:08:38,890
like you lost the language lottery and 
so you better make up for it,

2956
02:08:39,040 --> 02:08:40,300
like you're just going to have to do 
that.

2957
02:08:40,570 --> 02:08:43,510
And at a certain point when you've 
learned three or four languages,

2958
02:08:43,540 --> 02:08:44,770
it's now like,
Oh,

2959
02:08:44,780 --> 02:08:46,450
you've sussed this thing out.
You're like,

2960
02:08:46,480 --> 02:08:47,920
oh,
I get how this works.

2961
02:08:48,190 --> 02:08:49,023
Like this is just about work and there 
are certain techniques and certain 

2962
02:08:50,861 --> 02:08:52,600
approaches you start to get really,
really good at it.

2963
02:08:53,050 --> 02:08:53,883
So,
you know,

2964
02:08:53,960 --> 02:08:54,793
I really sort of from my dad picked up 
this love of learning languages and my 

2965
02:08:57,701 --> 02:08:58,530
dad is,
you know,

2966
02:08:58,530 --> 02:09:00,370
sort of,
especially into languages,

2967
02:09:00,400 --> 02:09:01,233
like every time they,
he didn't really like school and every 

2968
02:09:03,461 --> 02:09:05,380
time they would tell him he had to take 
another subject,

2969
02:09:05,590 --> 02:09:08,890
he would look up another language take.
So for example,

2970
02:09:09,070 --> 02:09:12,550
he ended up taking Swedish because in 
the sixties and seventies,

2971
02:09:12,551 --> 02:09:13,384
all the pornos were made in Sweden and 
he wanted to know what they were saying 

2972
02:09:18,041 --> 02:09:19,840
between sexual thrust.

2973
02:09:20,060 --> 02:09:21,430
Oh,
that's hilarious.

2974
02:09:21,460 --> 02:09:22,293
So he learned Swedish.
He learns all these fucking weird 

2975
02:09:24,131 --> 02:09:24,791
languages,
right?

2976
02:09:24,791 --> 02:09:26,110
Because they were like,
okay,

2977
02:09:26,111 --> 02:09:28,810
you need me to take another class.
I'm going to do something that I enjoy,

2978
02:09:29,040 --> 02:09:30,550
right,
like pretty normal sense.

2979
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:31,833
But then on the other hand,
my mom's from Kansas and in Kansas they 

2980
02:09:34,961 --> 02:09:38,110
don't speak foreign languages.
Like that's not the thing that's done.

2981
02:09:38,111 --> 02:09:39,970
And so there would be this experience of
like,

2982
02:09:39,971 --> 02:09:40,804
you know,
I took Japanese in high school and I 

2983
02:09:42,191 --> 02:09:43,030
would be like,
Oh yeah,

2984
02:09:43,031 --> 02:09:44,920
I'm taking Japanese.
And they'd go like,

2985
02:09:45,320 --> 02:09:47,440
what the fuck?
Like who are you?

2986
02:09:47,441 --> 02:09:50,140
And you've taken Latin and ancient Greek
and they're like,

2987
02:09:50,141 --> 02:09:52,690
that's fucking weird.
And you know,

2988
02:09:52,691 --> 02:09:55,570
so you're moving between these two 
different environments and you're like,

2989
02:09:56,260 --> 02:09:57,093
I feel like the issue here is that you 
just think about languages in different 

2990
02:10:00,581 --> 02:10:02,530
ways.
Like I don't know that it's,

2991
02:10:02,531 --> 02:10:05,770
that you have different potentially you 
just have different attitudes to it.

2992
02:10:05,850 --> 02:10:06,683
Right.
So hearing all these kids say all these 

2993
02:10:09,401 --> 02:10:10,234
bizarre things and you know,
at the time I was doing a tutoring 

2994
02:10:13,001 --> 02:10:13,834
company with a friend of mine from 
college who is from New England and you 

2995
02:10:17,081 --> 02:10:17,914
know,
the New England is that pure and 

2996
02:10:18,741 --> 02:10:19,541
culture,
right?

2997
02:10:19,541 --> 02:10:20,374
It's,
you know,

2998
02:10:20,500 --> 02:10:23,560
all self-denial,
no fun work hard,

2999
02:10:23,561 --> 02:10:27,010
all of that sort of stuff.
So she also heard all of these weird and

3000
02:10:27,011 --> 02:10:30,060
wacky beliefs and she was like,
you know,

3001
02:10:30,100 --> 02:10:32,800
reacted in the puritan way possible,
which is like,

3002
02:10:32,830 --> 02:10:36,470
you're just being fucking lazy.
Like fucking like do your fucking work.

3003
02:10:36,680 --> 02:10:37,940
No excuses,
right?

3004
02:10:37,941 --> 02:10:41,930
It's not Boston attitude,
so prevalent attitude.

3005
02:10:42,410 --> 02:10:43,340
And so,
you know,

3006
02:10:43,341 --> 02:10:46,130
you've got this Bostonian and then 
you've got this half Dutch,

3007
02:10:46,131 --> 02:10:47,480
half American,
you know,

3008
02:10:47,870 --> 02:10:49,310
lived with the limeys,
you know,

3009
02:10:49,311 --> 02:10:50,490
all this sort of stuff.
Right?

3010
02:10:50,630 --> 02:10:52,850
And we're like,
we're the outsiders.

3011
02:10:52,851 --> 02:10:54,260
It's that experience that you talked 
about,

3012
02:10:54,261 --> 02:10:55,094
uh,
foreigners who come to America or 

3013
02:10:56,001 --> 02:10:56,570
anybody.

3014
02:10:56,570 --> 02:11:00,280
And we're like,
this culture of La is fucking weird.

3015
02:11:00,290 --> 02:11:01,580
Now,
what brought you here?

3016
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:02,990
Uh,
well,

3017
02:11:03,050 --> 02:11:05,240
I always wanted to move to the west 
coast.

3018
02:11:05,420 --> 02:11:05,991
So,
you know,

3019
02:11:05,991 --> 02:11:06,824
I watched triggered last night and I 
agree with you that California is the 

3020
02:11:09,501 --> 02:11:13,010
best place on earth,
but particularly because,

3021
02:11:13,011 --> 02:11:13,761
I mean,
you know,

3022
02:11:13,761 --> 02:11:14,594
I mean it is the what part of what I 
found like a lot of what I was reacting 

3023
02:11:17,811 --> 02:11:18,531
against,
right?

3024
02:11:18,531 --> 02:11:21,470
You leave places [inaudible] there's 
something you don't like and then you go

3025
02:11:21,471 --> 02:11:22,304
to the most opposite place you can find.
And so I didn't like the culture of 

3026
02:11:25,191 --> 02:11:27,080
England,
I didn't like aristocracy,

3027
02:11:27,081 --> 02:11:30,260
I didn't like that whole class system,
I fucking hated it.

3028
02:11:30,530 --> 02:11:31,363
And then when I went to Boston and New 
York I felt like there was still a lot 

3029
02:11:34,521 --> 02:11:35,354
of that sort of hierarchy and I think 
that La is the place where it's like 

3030
02:11:39,110 --> 02:11:43,520
nobody gives a fuck where you come from.
Like there isn't that hierarchy,

3031
02:11:43,730 --> 02:11:45,200
you know,
all of that sort of stuff.

3032
02:11:45,201 --> 02:11:46,610
Doesn't matter.
It's the wild west.

3033
02:11:46,611 --> 02:11:47,444
And I love that.

3034
02:11:47,520 --> 02:11:49,530
It definitely isn't a lot of ways.
I mean to me,

3035
02:11:49,531 --> 02:11:53,400
I think it's the last place that people 
we know they landed on the east coast,

3036
02:11:53,401 --> 02:11:55,230
they made their way to the west coast.
I said,

3037
02:11:55,231 --> 02:11:57,300
well I don't want to live in Hawaii.
So this is what it was.

3038
02:11:57,420 --> 02:11:58,620
Exactly.
That's litter.

3039
02:11:58,621 --> 02:12:01,440
And the people that did move to Hawaii,
that's why.

3040
02:12:01,700 --> 02:12:04,830
I mean I fucking love Hawaii.
And one of the things I love about it is

3041
02:12:04,831 --> 02:12:06,300
the ex pats,
the people that go,

3042
02:12:06,301 --> 02:12:07,380
you know what man?
Fuck it.

3043
02:12:08,010 --> 02:12:09,510
Fuck it.
I'm just out here now.

3044
02:12:09,600 --> 02:12:10,980
Yep.
And that's,

3045
02:12:11,010 --> 02:12:11,843
that's the culture that I always wanted 
to be a part of was the culture that 

3046
02:12:15,031 --> 02:12:16,830
it's like,
who the fuck cares,

3047
02:12:16,831 --> 02:12:19,650
like we're done with that shit,
but Hawaii is too much.

3048
02:12:19,680 --> 02:12:20,460
Right.
Well,

3049
02:12:20,460 --> 02:12:20,920
uh,
you know,

3050
02:12:20,920 --> 02:12:22,980
I mean I probably should have gone to 
Hawaii.

3051
02:12:23,980 --> 02:12:24,813
It's hard.
Well it seems like now it's more viable 

3052
02:12:26,021 --> 02:12:28,490
than ever before because the Internet,
you know,

3053
02:12:28,510 --> 02:12:33,490
it's just pretty much access evenly to 
everything other than what's immediately

3054
02:12:33,491 --> 02:12:34,324
in your area.

3055
02:12:34,510 --> 02:12:35,343
But also engine.
I think also it's important to talk 

3056
02:12:37,211 --> 02:12:39,490
about like how do humans actually work?
Right.

3057
02:12:39,550 --> 02:12:41,370
And it's often that,
you know,

3058
02:12:41,410 --> 02:12:43,480
I mean,
so a large part of what comes out of the

3059
02:12:43,481 --> 02:12:45,790
sciences that thinking and feeling are 
always linked.

3060
02:12:46,030 --> 02:12:46,863
Right.
And so we're often driven by feelings 

3061
02:12:47,951 --> 02:12:50,140
that we can't quite explain.
So,

3062
02:12:50,200 --> 02:12:51,033
you know,
the,

3063
02:12:51,040 --> 02:12:56,040
the why was I also motivated by La,
I think there was some attraction to the

3064
02:12:56,291 --> 02:12:58,270
entertainment industry,
comedy,

3065
02:12:58,271 --> 02:13:00,400
storytelling.
I don't really,

3066
02:13:00,430 --> 02:13:01,990
you know,
like if you're being really honest,

3067
02:13:01,991 --> 02:13:04,960
like why the fuck do you make any 
decision that you make when you're 22,

3068
02:13:04,961 --> 02:13:05,794
23?
Right,

3069
02:13:05,850 --> 02:13:06,700
right.
Like you're just,

3070
02:13:07,240 --> 02:13:08,073
there's,
and there's some sort of cultural 

3071
02:13:08,921 --> 02:13:12,070
baggage that's driving you there.
They watch Baywatch like.

3072
02:13:12,071 --> 02:13:12,904
Exactly,
but you have some sort of fantasy 

3073
02:13:14,081 --> 02:13:16,920
version.
It is the Bible Moskovitz a shower where

3074
02:13:18,440 --> 02:13:19,273
you think there are no cats in Los 
Angeles and the streets are paved with 

3075
02:13:22,031 --> 02:13:24,310
cheese and then you get out here and 
you're like,

3076
02:13:24,370 --> 02:13:26,140
they're fucking scientologists 
everywhere.

3077
02:13:27,290 --> 02:13:27,640
Yeah.

3078
02:13:27,640 --> 02:13:28,473
Well Dude,
that's one of the things that I wanted 

3079
02:13:29,630 --> 02:13:34,630
to talk to you about before we get get 
to talk to you about your,

3080
02:13:34,870 --> 02:13:37,420
your calling Richard Dawkins,
the scientologists.

3081
02:13:37,430 --> 02:13:38,110
Yeah.

3082
02:13:38,110 --> 02:13:39,610
So the,
the larger.

3083
02:13:39,640 --> 02:13:40,473
So you've now gotten a taste of some of 
the things that are going on across 

3084
02:13:43,121 --> 02:13:44,260
science,
right?

3085
02:13:44,320 --> 02:13:48,790
There's lots of really exciting stuff 
that can actually change and improve and

3086
02:13:48,820 --> 02:13:49,900
help people's lives.

3087
02:13:50,230 --> 02:13:51,063
But one of the things I think that you 
pointed out that's incredibly critical 

3088
02:13:53,590 --> 02:13:58,330
is that to or in order to be at the top 
of your field,

3089
02:13:58,750 --> 02:13:59,583
you must be completely absorbed in that 
particular subject and oftentimes a lot 

3090
02:14:03,851 --> 02:14:04,684
like all the other systems that we find 
that have limited resources and you 

3091
02:14:08,051 --> 02:14:08,884
really don't have the time or the energy
or even the inclination to study all 

3092
02:14:12,341 --> 02:14:17,341
these other comparable systems or 
different disciplines or it's like,

3093
02:14:18,380 --> 02:14:20,020
I mean there's many,
many,

3094
02:14:20,021 --> 02:14:21,340
many,
many examples of that,

3095
02:14:21,540 --> 02:14:24,520
but singular focus is,
which usually leads to greatness.

3096
02:14:24,700 --> 02:14:27,430
And when you're reading about some 
professors,

3097
02:14:27,431 --> 02:14:29,530
peer reviewed work that's incredibly 
groundbreaking,

3098
02:14:29,770 --> 02:14:32,530
oftentimes you're dealing with a form of
greatness.

3099
02:14:32,740 --> 02:14:34,810
And that requires massive tunnel vision.

3100
02:14:35,130 --> 02:14:37,230
Well,
that's the interesting thing.

3101
02:14:37,231 --> 02:14:39,150
So we should talk about what tunnel 
vision is,

3102
02:14:39,290 --> 02:14:41,100
right?
So there's,

3103
02:14:41,130 --> 02:14:43,110
you know,
just as we have optimism and pessimism,

3104
02:14:43,111 --> 02:14:45,660
there are these other two mindsets,
atomism in holism,

3105
02:14:45,840 --> 02:14:49,200
right?
And atomism is the seeing the tree,

3106
02:14:49,230 --> 02:14:50,063
right?
You like ignore the fucking forest and 

3107
02:14:51,571 --> 02:14:52,404
you're just like,
I'm going to look at that one fucking 

3108
02:14:53,851 --> 02:14:55,620
tree and become the world's expert in 
that.

3109
02:14:55,920 --> 02:14:57,840
And then there's whole ism,
which is seeing the big picture,

3110
02:14:57,841 --> 02:14:59,970
seeing the forest,
seeing all that sort of stuff.

3111
02:15:00,230 --> 02:15:01,063
Now again,
everybody has these mindsets but 

3112
02:15:03,660 --> 02:15:05,550
different cultures favor than 
differently,

3113
02:15:05,551 --> 02:15:06,384
again,
because of the environmental pressures 

3114
02:15:07,591 --> 02:15:08,424
of that environment.
So the Greeks massively favored atomism 

3115
02:15:11,820 --> 02:15:14,420
and if you look at the behavior of the 
Greeks,

3116
02:15:14,590 --> 02:15:15,423
the ancient Greeks,
they were constantly picking everything 

3117
02:15:16,681 --> 02:15:17,514
apart,
right?

3118
02:15:17,640 --> 02:15:21,390
Because they were pirates pirates and 
traders and fishermen.

3119
02:15:21,690 --> 02:15:22,523
And in that environment,
it's not about cooperation or anything 

3120
02:15:25,201 --> 02:15:25,710
like that.

3121
02:15:25,710 --> 02:15:26,543
It's about everybody just trying to get 
ahead for themselves and all that sort 

3122
02:15:28,411 --> 02:15:30,000
of stuff.
Very individualistic.

3123
02:15:30,270 --> 02:15:31,103
All of that stuff.
And so when they would have leisure 

3124
02:15:33,181 --> 02:15:35,250
time,
what were the things they did?

3125
02:15:35,460 --> 02:15:37,080
Well,
they would go and they would go into the

3126
02:15:37,081 --> 02:15:37,914
marketplace and they would argue with 
each other and pick apart each other's 

3127
02:15:39,991 --> 02:15:41,670
arguments and they would just pick,
pick,

3128
02:15:41,671 --> 02:15:42,001
pick,
pick,

3129
02:15:42,001 --> 02:15:42,391
pick,
pick,

3130
02:15:42,391 --> 02:15:43,224
pick.
And that's what logic is and rhetoric 

3131
02:15:44,551 --> 02:15:45,920
and all that sort of stuff.
Um,

3132
02:15:46,030 --> 02:15:47,730
and then they would also,
you know,

3133
02:15:47,731 --> 02:15:48,564
when they had other leisure time,
they would go and see who could throw 

3134
02:15:51,031 --> 02:15:52,530
shit furthest,
right?

3135
02:15:52,531 --> 02:15:56,040
Like who run fastest,
it's all about standing out.

3136
02:15:56,070 --> 02:15:58,350
It's all about trying to excel and be 
the best.

3137
02:15:58,560 --> 02:15:59,760
And what happened is,
is that,

3138
02:15:59,761 --> 02:16:01,650
you know,
the is during the renaissance,

3139
02:16:01,890 --> 02:16:02,730
that they

3140
02:16:03,240 --> 02:16:04,073
say that again,
renascence and they sold in America 

3141
02:16:08,341 --> 02:16:10,730
says,
um,

3142
02:16:11,160 --> 02:16:12,010
what?
So what,

3143
02:16:12,020 --> 02:16:12,870
what,
what is the,

3144
02:16:12,900 --> 02:16:13,733
what is the American way I want to fit 
in genaissance renaissance renaissance 

3145
02:16:16,190 --> 02:16:19,080
renaissance Paris,
or like the renaissance faire,

3146
02:16:19,100 --> 02:16:21,780
Patty Paris,
Paris,

3147
02:16:21,930 --> 02:16:23,520
France,
say France,

3148
02:16:23,550 --> 02:16:25,360
not France from France.
Well,

3149
02:16:25,370 --> 02:16:27,690
I just have to really channel my inner 
Kansas.

3150
02:16:31,120 --> 02:16:31,953
Well,
whenever you want to fucking call the 

3151
02:16:32,980 --> 02:16:34,170
rebirth,
rebirth,

3152
02:16:34,300 --> 02:16:35,133
right?
They basically were obsessed with the 

3153
02:16:36,881 --> 02:16:37,714
Greeks and the Romans were obsessed with
the Greeks and then when the rebirth or 

3154
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:42,833
assaults happened,
they were obsessed with the Romans and 

3155
02:16:44,711 --> 02:16:45,544
the Greeks.
And so they became obsessed with this 

3156
02:16:47,891 --> 02:16:48,724
culture and that's how you start to get 
this culture of individualism that 

3157
02:16:51,521 --> 02:16:52,354
develops.
The founding fathers were obsessed with 

3158
02:16:54,071 --> 02:16:54,904
that.
And so that becomes a lot of the spirit 

3159
02:16:56,831 --> 02:16:58,030
of the West,
right?

3160
02:16:58,031 --> 02:17:01,360
Is this real atomistic culture.
Meanwhile,

3161
02:17:01,480 --> 02:17:03,220
over in Asia,
right?

3162
02:17:03,280 --> 02:17:05,440
They have different incentives,
which is rice farming.

3163
02:17:05,500 --> 02:17:07,930
And so what happens is,
is that rice farming is,

3164
02:17:07,931 --> 02:17:10,450
you know,
you have to be super cooperative because

3165
02:17:10,660 --> 02:17:13,300
the water runs down the mountain,
it runs through my patty field,

3166
02:17:13,301 --> 02:17:15,730
but then it runs through your neighbor's
patty field and all that sort of stuff.

3167
02:17:15,910 --> 02:17:16,743
So I have to have relations with my 
neighbor and that neighbor and then I 

3168
02:17:19,541 --> 02:17:20,374
have to think about how it affects the 
next guy and the next guy and the next 

3169
02:17:21,791 --> 02:17:22,624
guy and the next guy.

3170
02:17:22,750 --> 02:17:26,080
So they favor whole ism.
How does everything fit together?

3171
02:17:26,350 --> 02:17:30,190
And so if you look at what is Eastern 
culture about,

3172
02:17:30,191 --> 02:17:31,750
what are those ancient Asian culture is 
about,

3173
02:17:31,960 --> 02:17:32,793
it's all about Yin and Yang things 
fitting together and complimenting it 

3174
02:17:35,741 --> 02:17:37,540
all.
Being part of a larger system.

3175
02:17:37,750 --> 02:17:38,583
And Confucianism was all about the 
family and relationships and everybody 

3176
02:17:41,591 --> 02:17:42,424
has their proper role and you all sort 
of have to belong and all of that sort 

3177
02:17:45,461 --> 02:17:46,294
of stuff.
Right?

3178
02:17:47,020 --> 02:17:52,020
So which set of biases do you think that
science has baked into it's culture?

3179
02:17:52,880 --> 02:17:55,180
Adam is.
And so what,

3180
02:17:55,210 --> 02:17:58,900
when you get the structure of scientific
culture as it stands today,

3181
02:17:59,050 --> 02:18:04,050
it's super atomistic right now.
If you look at things like economics and

3182
02:18:04,211 --> 02:18:05,044
psychology and you know,
biology and all of these sorts of 

3183
02:18:08,141 --> 02:18:08,974
things,
they're all studying the natural world 

3184
02:18:10,510 --> 02:18:13,720
and in fact there's a whole bunch of 
disciplines that are all studying humans

3185
02:18:13,721 --> 02:18:17,710
and how they behave and all that sort of
stuff and yet they're all broken up into

3186
02:18:17,711 --> 02:18:18,544
separate disciplines and now they're 
sort of doubling down on those 

3187
02:18:21,791 --> 02:18:22,624
intuitions and they're now breaking up 
those disciplines into subdisciplines 

3188
02:18:25,330 --> 02:18:26,163
and smaller disciplines and smaller 
disciplines and left to their own 

3189
02:18:28,271 --> 02:18:28,780
devices.

3190
02:18:28,780 --> 02:18:31,360
They'll just keep splitting up and 
getting smaller and smaller.

3191
02:18:31,480 --> 02:18:33,160
And where does feminism fit in all of 
this?

3192
02:18:33,250 --> 02:18:34,830
Well,
the but that,

3193
02:18:35,030 --> 02:18:35,651
that's.
I mean,

3194
02:18:35,651 --> 02:18:36,620
you know what,
what,

3195
02:18:36,640 --> 02:18:37,473
what happens is,
is that as you get smaller and smaller 

3196
02:18:40,181 --> 02:18:41,014
and smaller disciplines,
that it doesn't necessarily make the 

3197
02:18:43,781 --> 02:18:47,260
science better.
It can make the science worse.

3198
02:18:47,740 --> 02:18:50,680
And the reason why it makes a science 
where it's the easiest way to understand

3199
02:18:50,681 --> 02:18:52,990
it is the story of the blind men and the
elephant.

3200
02:18:53,260 --> 02:18:55,990
Right?
So this is an old story about from India

3201
02:18:55,991 --> 02:18:56,824
about religion.
So a group of blind men decide come 

3202
02:18:58,991 --> 02:19:00,700
along and they decided to figure out the
elephant.

3203
02:19:00,730 --> 02:19:02,860
So this what this thing is,
right?

3204
02:19:02,861 --> 02:19:03,694
They don't know what's an elephant.
So the first one comes up and he feels 

3205
02:19:05,561 --> 02:19:06,394
the tail and he feels the end of it and 
it feels a little hairs at the end he 

3206
02:19:08,021 --> 02:19:09,640
says it's a rope,
right?

3207
02:19:09,640 --> 02:19:10,473
And the second one goes along and he 
feels the trunk and it rides in his 

3208
02:19:12,821 --> 02:19:14,500
hands and he jumps back,
startled and he's like,

3209
02:19:14,501 --> 02:19:15,730
it's a snake.
Right?

3210
02:19:15,731 --> 02:19:17,980
And the third one feels the leg,
he thinks it's a column.

3211
02:19:17,981 --> 02:19:20,140
The fourth one feels the side,
he thinks it's a wall,

3212
02:19:20,320 --> 02:19:21,153
and then the fifth one feels the ear and
decides that it's a palm leaf and then 

3213
02:19:25,120 --> 02:19:25,953
they all proceed to beat the shit out of
other because clearly everybody else is 

3214
02:19:28,611 --> 02:19:29,444
a fucking idiot.
And they need to die because they know 

3215
02:19:31,941 --> 02:19:33,320
that it's a rope.
It's a snake.

3216
02:19:33,321 --> 02:19:35,030
It's a leg,
it's a wall,

3217
02:19:35,031 --> 02:19:37,820
it's a column.
Whatever it is right now,

3218
02:19:38,570 --> 02:19:41,480
if you look at something like feminism,
right?

3219
02:19:41,510 --> 02:19:44,180
Feminism is making certain claims about 
biology,

3220
02:19:44,300 --> 02:19:47,180
right?
It's making claims about how male gender

3221
02:19:47,181 --> 02:19:49,010
works,
how female gender works,

3222
02:19:49,210 --> 02:19:50,043
you know,
they should be looking at things like 

3223
02:19:50,781 --> 02:19:52,820
genetics and they should be looking at,
you know,

3224
02:19:52,890 --> 02:19:53,723
chromosomes,
and they should be looking at evolution 

3225
02:19:56,271 --> 02:19:59,840
to see how evolution might've selected 
for differences in men and women because

3226
02:20:00,080 --> 02:20:02,480
there are different competing pressures 
for men and women.

3227
02:20:02,750 --> 02:20:04,490
And in fact,
if you go into,

3228
02:20:04,580 --> 02:20:06,140
you know,
actual science,

3229
02:20:06,141 --> 02:20:08,540
you'll find that there's actually lots 
of science about that.

3230
02:20:09,080 --> 02:20:09,913
But what's happened is,
is that feminism has become its own 

3231
02:20:11,841 --> 02:20:13,400
tribe,
right?

3232
02:20:13,670 --> 02:20:18,110
And as a tribe,
it rejects the findings of other tribes,

3233
02:20:18,230 --> 02:20:19,130
right?
So I,

3234
02:20:19,131 --> 02:20:24,131
if I go into the circles of feminism or 
sociology or any other tribe,

3235
02:20:25,731 --> 02:20:27,110
and I start talking about,
you know,

3236
02:20:27,111 --> 02:20:29,480
the evidence of some other tribe,
they're like,

3237
02:20:29,481 --> 02:20:30,410
oh,
that doesn't count,

3238
02:20:30,710 --> 02:20:32,510
right?
It's easy to rationalize it away.

3239
02:20:32,870 --> 02:20:36,320
And so now we're no longer grounded in 
reality.

3240
02:20:36,470 --> 02:20:37,303
And what we can do is we can take that 
tail and we can convince ourselves that 

3241
02:20:40,911 --> 02:20:42,230
it's a rope,
right?

3242
02:20:42,231 --> 02:20:45,350
Because we're not accountable to all of 
these other fields that surrounding it.

3243
02:20:45,460 --> 02:20:46,530
Does it make sense?
Yes.

3244
02:20:47,200 --> 02:20:49,100
So what if you want to solve the 
problem,

3245
02:20:49,550 --> 02:20:52,580
what you have to do is,
is that you have to make each discipline

3246
02:20:52,581 --> 02:20:54,680
accountable to all the other 
disciplines.

3247
02:20:54,890 --> 02:20:59,090
You have to make people responsive to 
evidence outside of their field.

3248
02:20:59,510 --> 02:21:02,150
So if you take someone like Richard 
Dawkins,

3249
02:21:02,180 --> 02:21:03,013
right,
has Richard Dawkins gone down his 

3250
02:21:05,061 --> 02:21:08,620
particular rabbit hole of figuring out,
you know,

3251
02:21:08,710 --> 02:21:10,910
his tiny piece of the world?
Yes,

3252
02:21:10,911 --> 02:21:12,710
he has done that.
And what makes you think that?

3253
02:21:13,100 --> 02:21:14,240
Well,
I can tell you.

3254
02:21:14,241 --> 02:21:15,074
So in general,
what you're going to find is that 

3255
02:21:17,060 --> 02:21:19,520
there's a,
in a lot of different fields,

3256
02:21:19,580 --> 02:21:23,060
you're going to find that there are two 
competing theories right now.

3257
02:21:23,120 --> 02:21:25,370
So for example,
if you look in economics,

3258
02:21:26,900 --> 02:21:28,040
there's this idea,
you know,

3259
02:21:28,041 --> 02:21:30,170
there's sort of what are called 
classical economics,

3260
02:21:30,440 --> 02:21:31,273
um,
and they have this idea called rational 

3261
02:21:32,361 --> 02:21:33,194
agent theory,
and they basically think it's a 

3262
02:21:34,881 --> 02:21:38,270
reasonable approximation to assume that 
people are rational,

3263
02:21:38,300 --> 02:21:39,133
right?
That they act is rational individuals 

3264
02:21:40,371 --> 02:21:41,204
and all this sort of stuff.
And then meanwhile there's another 

3265
02:21:43,491 --> 02:21:45,530
school called behavioral economics.

3266
02:21:45,770 --> 02:21:48,290
And because of Daniel Kahneman and Amos 
Tversky,

3267
02:21:48,291 --> 02:21:51,680
who were these two Israeli psychologists
in the 19 seventies who started to study

3268
02:21:51,681 --> 02:21:53,830
human rationality,
and you know,

3269
02:21:54,140 --> 02:21:55,940
I'm sure this will come as a huge 
surprise,

3270
02:21:55,941 --> 02:21:58,630
but what they found is that humans 
aren't that rational,

3271
02:21:58,960 --> 02:21:59,793
right?
And so there was a group of economists 

3272
02:22:02,391 --> 02:22:03,650
who say,
Hey,

3273
02:22:03,651 --> 02:22:07,130
our whole discipline is based on this 
idea of rational agent theory,

3274
02:22:07,340 --> 02:22:11,480
but when we look at psychology,
that assumption doesn't check out and it

3275
02:22:11,481 --> 02:22:13,490
leads to a whole bunch of bad 
conclusions.

3276
02:22:13,670 --> 02:22:17,120
So they formed a new school of economics
called behavioral economics,

3277
02:22:17,121 --> 02:22:19,910
which is based on all the findings of 
psychology,

3278
02:22:19,911 --> 02:22:22,400
how humans actually think and all that 
sort of stuff.

3279
02:22:22,850 --> 02:22:25,030
Now these two schools are warring right 
there,

3280
02:22:25,050 --> 02:22:25,883
two fighting tribes.
But what ends up happening is that they 

3281
02:22:29,221 --> 02:22:30,054
can't solve that discipline.
They can't solve that in the context of 

3282
02:22:33,781 --> 02:22:34,614
academia,
right?

3283
02:22:34,800 --> 02:22:38,100
The fire papers back and forth,
lots of discussions are had and all that

3284
02:22:38,101 --> 02:22:38,934
sort of stuff.
But essentially you have a recurring 

3285
02:22:41,311 --> 02:22:45,300
problem in science,
which is that scientists won't let go of

3286
02:22:45,301 --> 02:22:48,540
their pet theories.
They won't let their theories die.

3287
02:22:48,990 --> 02:22:49,823
And Max Planck,
the physicists had this famous quote 

3288
02:22:51,931 --> 02:22:54,480
that he said,
science proceeds one funeral at a time.

3289
02:22:54,770 --> 02:22:55,603
Um,
and essentially what happens is it 

3290
02:22:56,960 --> 02:22:59,610
science doesn't progress because,
uh,

3291
02:22:59,611 --> 02:23:00,660
you know,
people are like,

3292
02:23:00,661 --> 02:23:02,520
Hey,
new evidence came out.

3293
02:23:02,730 --> 02:23:03,563
Turns out I was wrong,
now I'm going to change my mind because 

3294
02:23:06,841 --> 02:23:07,674
it's their theory.
And so they keep on fighting for and 

3295
02:23:10,321 --> 02:23:12,030
defending their theory until they're 
dead.

3296
02:23:12,420 --> 02:23:14,500
And then the discipline is like,
oh,

3297
02:23:14,501 --> 02:23:15,221
okay,
now that,

3298
02:23:15,221 --> 02:23:18,120
that guy's dead,
obviously that was dumb all along,

3299
02:23:18,330 --> 02:23:20,460
let's move forward.
Interesting.

3300
02:23:20,461 --> 02:23:23,220
So ego becomes this sort of trap.
Huge problem.

3301
02:23:23,490 --> 02:23:25,200
Huge problem for science in general.

3302
02:23:25,530 --> 02:23:27,930
And so if you look at,
for example,

3303
02:23:27,931 --> 02:23:30,650
that rational agent theory dispute,
uh,

3304
02:23:30,651 --> 02:23:31,484
there's a,
the one of the big founders of 

3305
02:23:32,371 --> 02:23:34,530
behavioral economics,
this Guy Richard Thaler,

3306
02:23:34,860 --> 02:23:36,480
um,
basically,

3307
02:23:36,540 --> 02:23:37,373
you know,
he tells a great story and the story is 

3308
02:23:38,881 --> 02:23:42,120
that he's at a dinner party and at this 
dinner party,

3309
02:23:42,121 --> 02:23:46,050
there's this famous economists from the 
whole rational agent theory camp.

3310
02:23:46,590 --> 02:23:48,030
And this,
uh,

3311
02:23:48,060 --> 02:23:50,730
there's also like a bunch of other 
academics like a psychologist.

3312
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:54,690
And so the guy who believes in rational 
agent theories going on and on about how

3313
02:23:54,691 --> 02:23:56,820
fucking dumb people are,
right,

3314
02:23:56,821 --> 02:23:59,820
how irrational they are.
So he's going on about his own wife.

3315
02:23:59,821 --> 02:24:01,800
He says,
my wife is so irrational.

3316
02:24:02,010 --> 02:24:06,720
She just bought a new car but she won't 
drive it and that makes no sense because

3317
02:24:06,721 --> 02:24:09,330
she's worried about digging it,
but she's already paid for the car.

3318
02:24:09,331 --> 02:24:12,240
She should use it.
God humans are so irrational.

3319
02:24:12,270 --> 02:24:16,470
And then he goes and my students,
my students are so fucking dumb,

3320
02:24:16,530 --> 02:24:17,363
right?
They can't even understand the most 

3321
02:24:18,211 --> 02:24:21,510
basic economic concepts and all that 
sort of stuff.

3322
02:24:22,020 --> 02:24:24,330
And so the psychologist pipes up and 
says,

3323
02:24:24,810 --> 02:24:29,010
how come all the people in your theories
are geniuses?

3324
02:24:29,280 --> 02:24:32,280
But all the people you know in real life
are idiots.

3325
02:24:32,970 --> 02:24:36,390
And that's a problem.
That's a real problem for your theory,

3326
02:24:36,600 --> 02:24:37,433
right?
Because your ubs observations about 

3327
02:24:39,331 --> 02:24:44,331
reality do not fit your theory,
but what does this guy do?

3328
02:24:44,940 --> 02:24:46,530
Does this guy say,
you know what?

3329
02:24:46,830 --> 02:24:49,230
I'm going to fall on my sword.
I'm going to throw out 30,

3330
02:24:49,231 --> 02:24:51,540
40 years of work on a bad idea.
No,

3331
02:24:51,541 --> 02:24:52,374
he's not going to say that.
Instead what he does is he does what 

3332
02:24:54,211 --> 02:24:55,044
Richard Thaler calls the invisible hand 
wave where he proceeds to wave his hand 

3333
02:24:58,441 --> 02:24:59,221
and say,
well,

3334
02:24:59,221 --> 02:25:01,860
you know,
there might be some irrationality,

3335
02:25:01,861 --> 02:25:02,400
blah,
blah,

3336
02:25:02,400 --> 02:25:03,233
blah blah.

3337
02:25:03,360 --> 02:25:08,040
But in the end markets sort things out 
and that's,

3338
02:25:08,070 --> 02:25:10,230
he's rationalizing scientists,
rationalized.

3339
02:25:10,231 --> 02:25:11,064
Humans rationalized.
They want to defend their own most 

3340
02:25:13,021 --> 02:25:15,780
cherished ideas.
And so that's not.

3341
02:25:15,810 --> 02:25:19,260
This is not a problem of Richard Dawkins
is a problem of humans.

3342
02:25:19,590 --> 02:25:20,423
Right?
And if humans have power and 

3343
02:25:21,511 --> 02:25:23,980
intellectual power as a form of power 
and it's not checked,

3344
02:25:24,250 --> 02:25:26,770
they will continue to rationalize their 
bad ideas.

3345
02:25:26,800 --> 02:25:29,530
So specifically what bad ideas is 
dawkins rationalizing?

3346
02:25:29,560 --> 02:25:30,990
Well,
so there's the,

3347
02:25:31,030 --> 02:25:31,700
you know,
the,

3348
02:25:31,700 --> 02:25:36,700
the intellectual dispute is this.
So in the 19 sixties there was this idea

3349
02:25:37,961 --> 02:25:38,794
of group selection,
but it was very fuzzy and it was a 

3350
02:25:40,841 --> 02:25:42,880
shitty version of group selection,
right?

3351
02:25:42,881 --> 02:25:43,714
Which is the idea that natural selection
happens not only at the level of genes 

3352
02:25:46,060 --> 02:25:49,360
but also at the level of human groups 
and the idea that selection is happening

3353
02:25:49,361 --> 02:25:49,901
at many,
many,

3354
02:25:49,901 --> 02:25:52,120
many levels.
And so Dawkins,

3355
02:25:52,121 --> 02:25:55,780
in 1976 writes this big important book,
the selfish gene,

3356
02:25:56,260 --> 02:26:00,400
and it's basically that you actually 
don't need group selection to make sense

3357
02:26:00,401 --> 02:26:01,390
of a lot of behavior.

3358
02:26:01,390 --> 02:26:03,340
You can just use what's called kin 
selection.

3359
02:26:03,670 --> 02:26:04,503
So for example,
you might do something nice for your 

3360
02:26:05,951 --> 02:26:07,930
sister or you might potentially,
you know,

3361
02:26:08,200 --> 02:26:09,033
die to save your sister,
but we can make sense of that at the 

3362
02:26:11,591 --> 02:26:14,010
level of genes because essentially,
you know,

3363
02:26:14,080 --> 02:26:16,110
your sister's shares many of the same 
genes.

3364
02:26:16,111 --> 02:26:16,944
So you know,
you don't need this idea that groups 

3365
02:26:18,461 --> 02:26:20,260
matter.
Now,

3366
02:26:20,620 --> 02:26:22,650
since then,
what's happened is,

3367
02:26:22,651 --> 02:26:23,484
is that there are,
and this is a large part of what the 

3368
02:26:25,901 --> 02:26:26,734
problem is,
that some people read that book 

3369
02:26:28,960 --> 02:26:29,793
including Jeff Skilling and they 
concluded that what that means is that 

3370
02:26:34,181 --> 02:26:38,890
the way to get ahead is to be selfish.
Jeff Skilling is the CEO of Enron,

3371
02:26:39,490 --> 02:26:41,380
right?
And you'll hear in business circles,

3372
02:26:41,381 --> 02:26:43,690
you'll hear this,
this idea of like,

3373
02:26:43,960 --> 02:26:44,793
oh,
it's all about law of the jungle killer 

3374
02:26:45,810 --> 02:26:47,920
be killed.
That's how you get ahead,

3375
02:26:47,921 --> 02:26:49,450
you know,
survival of the fittest.

3376
02:26:49,510 --> 02:26:50,343
So it's confirmation bias.
So exactly from their ideas about guts 

3377
02:26:53,801 --> 02:26:55,150
repeating in business.
That's right.

3378
02:26:55,570 --> 02:26:58,690
And know that's what scaling probably 
wanted to believe.

3379
02:26:58,691 --> 02:27:00,850
And so he read Dawkins' book and he's 
like,

3380
02:27:00,940 --> 02:27:01,773
ah,
now I have intellectual credibility for 

3381
02:27:04,151 --> 02:27:04,984
what I wanted to do anyway.
And so skilling runs and ron based on 

3382
02:27:08,740 --> 02:27:12,490
those ideas and what has this,
what he said what at Skilling.

3383
02:27:12,520 --> 02:27:13,001
Yes.
Yeah.

3384
02:27:13,001 --> 02:27:14,800
He.
So he said that he based it on Docklands

3385
02:27:14,801 --> 02:27:15,281
ideas.
Well,

3386
02:27:15,281 --> 02:27:17,470
I said that the selfish gene was his 
favorite book.

3387
02:27:17,940 --> 02:27:18,690
Okay.
I,

3388
02:27:18,690 --> 02:27:19,840
you know,
to find out,

3389
02:27:19,841 --> 02:27:22,330
I don't know exactly everything that 
skilling his son,

3390
02:27:22,960 --> 02:27:27,160
but he said it was his favorite book and
this is in general a big problem.

3391
02:27:27,270 --> 02:27:29,950
Science is the big magic of our time.
Right?

3392
02:27:30,010 --> 02:27:30,843
Like it's if you want to justify like 
feminists when they try and justify 

3393
02:27:33,791 --> 02:27:37,270
their.
If the sort of feminists who try and say

3394
02:27:37,271 --> 02:27:39,670
that gender doesn't matter and it's all 
social constructs,

3395
02:27:40,030 --> 02:27:42,250
they try and do it all in terms of 
science.

3396
02:27:42,250 --> 02:27:43,540
Right.
When the Nazi youth,

3397
02:27:43,550 --> 02:27:45,910
I mean what,
what sometimes to the point to,

3398
02:27:46,180 --> 02:27:47,680
well they have,
you know,

3399
02:27:47,681 --> 02:27:49,990
some sort of idea of culture or 
whatever.

3400
02:27:50,170 --> 02:27:51,003
But these other,
a lot of ideas that masquerade as 

3401
02:27:52,571 --> 02:27:53,470
science,
right?

3402
02:27:53,471 --> 02:27:55,960
So you know the Nazis,
the eugenics movement,

3403
02:27:56,210 --> 02:27:57,940
you know,
the Nazis that was,

3404
02:27:57,970 --> 02:28:02,380
that was based on some sort of idea that
they thought was science at the time,

3405
02:28:02,610 --> 02:28:05,500
you know,
the Soviets had this guy loves Sanko who

3406
02:28:05,501 --> 02:28:08,070
was the opposite and he believed that,
you know,

3407
02:28:08,260 --> 02:28:09,093
genes could be true.
Like he thought you could literally 

3408
02:28:11,110 --> 02:28:11,943
shock and electrocute seeds to make them
do what you wanted them to do because 

3409
02:28:15,041 --> 02:28:17,080
jeans didn't really matter and it was 
all conditioning,

3410
02:28:17,410 --> 02:28:18,930
right?
Or you know,

3411
02:28:18,970 --> 02:28:20,360
behaviorism,
right?

3412
02:28:20,470 --> 02:28:21,303
Was bf skinner's idea,
which was the idea that it was all 

3413
02:28:23,541 --> 02:28:26,030
stimulus response.
The human mind didn't exist.

3414
02:28:26,031 --> 02:28:27,830
There were no beliefs and all that 
stuff.

3415
02:28:28,010 --> 02:28:30,560
And a lot of the way that education,
for example,

3416
02:28:30,561 --> 02:28:31,394
the,
a lot of the educational pace choices 

3417
02:28:32,301 --> 02:28:34,880
that were made in the fifties were based
on skinner's ideas,

3418
02:28:35,060 --> 02:28:37,070
which then fucks up a whole bunch of 
kids.

3419
02:28:37,310 --> 02:28:38,143
You know,
either what ends up happening is that 

3420
02:28:39,471 --> 02:28:40,304
either science is applied or it's 
misapplied or misinterpreted or people 

3421
02:28:44,840 --> 02:28:45,673
you know,
read a particular scientific study and 

3422
02:28:46,941 --> 02:28:49,540
don't have the context on it.
And so you know,

3423
02:28:49,550 --> 02:28:52,880
these bad ideas permeate and they're 
applied and all of that sort of stuff.

3424
02:28:52,910 --> 02:28:54,650
Right.
And so the debate,

3425
02:28:54,651 --> 02:28:57,410
for example,
around rational agent theory is not some

3426
02:28:57,411 --> 02:28:58,910
act,
it is an academic debate,

3427
02:28:59,270 --> 02:29:01,010
but in addition to being an academic 
debate,

3428
02:29:01,040 --> 02:29:04,280
economists apply those ideas and you 
know,

3429
02:29:04,310 --> 02:29:08,740
the public needs to,
if the public wants it's experts and its

3430
02:29:08,750 --> 02:29:11,600
leaders to make the right decision than 
it has to hold them accountable on their

3431
02:29:11,601 --> 02:29:12,434
ideas.

3432
02:29:12,740 --> 02:29:14,270
And so,
you know,

3433
02:29:14,330 --> 02:29:15,920
if,
if you have,

3434
02:29:16,010 --> 02:29:19,070
you know,
science also has to police who has their

3435
02:29:19,071 --> 02:29:20,390
backing,
right?

3436
02:29:20,391 --> 02:29:21,224
And it needs,
it has a responsibility to communicate 

3437
02:29:22,851 --> 02:29:23,684
to the public what is the best 
scientific understanding available 

3438
02:29:27,051 --> 02:29:27,884
today.
So Skilling takes the selfish gene and 

3439
02:29:30,891 --> 02:29:31,724
he runs with that and clearly that's 
thinking that was very popular in the 

3440
02:29:34,491 --> 02:29:36,140
seventies and eighties,
the me generation,

3441
02:29:36,141 --> 02:29:36,974
all that sort of stuff.
So that selfish gene sort of slots into 

3442
02:29:40,011 --> 02:29:43,760
a culture that is already sort of 
looking for that to be true.

3443
02:29:44,030 --> 02:29:46,730
Right?
And it lends this credibility.

3444
02:29:47,280 --> 02:29:48,113
Um,
and what has happened is that the 

3445
02:29:49,881 --> 02:29:50,714
science has now moved on to,
to this idea of multilevel selection 

3446
02:29:54,921 --> 02:29:55,754
theory and a lot of what we've been 
talking about today in terms of how 

3447
02:29:58,191 --> 02:30:02,240
groups work and how culture works is all
based on those ideas and there's a whole

3448
02:30:02,241 --> 02:30:03,074
group of academics and a whole bunch of 
different disciplines that have these 

3449
02:30:05,691 --> 02:30:06,524
ideas.

3450
02:30:06,740 --> 02:30:08,670
And you know,
there are people like John Height,

3451
02:30:09,470 --> 02:30:12,380
people like Joe Henrich,
people like David Sloan Wilson who's the

3452
02:30:12,381 --> 02:30:17,381
big multilevel selection guy and when 
you put all of theirs or Daniel Conaman,

3453
02:30:17,900 --> 02:30:19,460
right?
Amos Tversky,

3454
02:30:19,670 --> 02:30:21,020
you know,
the list goes on and on and on.

3455
02:30:21,021 --> 02:30:23,570
But when you put all of these ideas 
together,

3456
02:30:23,930 --> 02:30:26,330
you get a really,
really compelling narrative.

3457
02:30:26,810 --> 02:30:27,643
Now doc and says that his work was 
misinterpreted and that I'm essentially 

3458
02:30:33,231 --> 02:30:34,070
the,
you know,

3459
02:30:34,071 --> 02:30:38,780
Jeff Skilling misunderstood his work now
doc and says very clearly in the selfish

3460
02:30:38,781 --> 02:30:41,930
gene that our nature is selfish.
Right?

3461
02:30:42,050 --> 02:30:42,883
So I mean that's,
that seems pretty clear that I don't 

3462
02:30:44,871 --> 02:30:46,760
know that Jeff Skilling entirely 
misinterpreted,

3463
02:30:47,180 --> 02:30:48,013
but what David Sloan Wilson and the 
multilevel selection people are saying 

3464
02:30:50,510 --> 02:30:53,540
something very simple.
An eo Wilson said this as well,

3465
02:30:53,780 --> 02:30:54,613
which is that altruism,
selfish individuals be altruistic 

3466
02:30:57,801 --> 02:30:58,634
individuals,
but altruistic groups beat selfish 

3467
02:31:00,981 --> 02:31:03,710
groups.
So if you want to get ahead,

3468
02:31:03,920 --> 02:31:04,753
right,
you can get ahead by being a selfish 

3469
02:31:05,841 --> 02:31:07,940
asshole and fucking everyone,
right?

3470
02:31:08,690 --> 02:31:09,523
But if you have a group that is based on
selfishness and you're trying to fuck 

3471
02:31:12,681 --> 02:31:13,514
everyone,
then your group is going gonna fall 

3472
02:31:15,021 --> 02:31:17,450
apart and it's going to lose out to an 
altruistic group.

3473
02:31:17,900 --> 02:31:22,650
So if you compare side by side accompany
like Enron and accompany like Pixar,

3474
02:31:22,710 --> 02:31:24,480
which you can read about and Creativity 
Inc,

3475
02:31:24,780 --> 02:31:27,240
you're going to find that they have two 
very different environments,

3476
02:31:27,241 --> 02:31:28,074
right?
Pixar is fundamentally a cooperative 

3477
02:31:29,881 --> 02:31:32,040
environment.
It's a high trust environment.

3478
02:31:32,041 --> 02:31:33,900
Everybody works together,
you know,

3479
02:31:33,901 --> 02:31:34,734
all of that sort of stuff and it's a 
sustainable company that year after 

3480
02:31:37,771 --> 02:31:38,604
year,
turns out great films and does great 

3481
02:31:39,781 --> 02:31:40,614
work and all that sort of stuff.
And Ron is a toxic environment because 

3482
02:31:43,921 --> 02:31:47,400
everybody is just trying to get ahead.
There is no I in team,

3483
02:31:47,610 --> 02:31:50,370
they're just fucking each other.
And so the thing blows up.

3484
02:31:51,060 --> 02:31:51,893
Now again,
science has a responsibility to 

3485
02:31:53,881 --> 02:31:57,270
communicate clearly and what should 
happen,

3486
02:31:57,360 --> 02:32:00,360
I think in terms of our economy,
not blowing the fuck up,

3487
02:32:00,480 --> 02:32:00,750
right?

3488
02:32:00,750 --> 02:32:05,270
In terms of corporations not engaging in
that sort of toxic behavior is,

3489
02:32:05,271 --> 02:32:06,104
is that,
you know,

3490
02:32:06,120 --> 02:32:08,370
I don't have the authority because I'm a
nobody,

3491
02:32:08,550 --> 02:32:11,700
right?
So I can't come out and say this is what

3492
02:32:11,701 --> 02:32:12,930
science is.
In fact,

3493
02:32:13,100 --> 02:32:13,933
there is literally no human alive today 
that can come out and say what science 

3494
02:32:16,771 --> 02:32:20,550
is because people can only come out and 
speak about their tiny field.

3495
02:32:20,790 --> 02:32:21,623
Right?
There's no consistent message from 

3496
02:32:22,741 --> 02:32:23,574
science especially don't understand what
Dawkins is arguing against because 

3497
02:32:26,041 --> 02:32:29,050
didn't he also argue for cooperation in 
this book?

3498
02:32:29,051 --> 02:32:30,690
Like wasn't one of the chapters of his 
book.

3499
02:32:30,691 --> 02:32:32,550
Nice guys finish first.
Well,

3500
02:32:32,551 --> 02:32:36,630
but he refuses to acknowledge this idea 
of group that group selection happens,

3501
02:32:36,631 --> 02:32:38,780
right?
He's refusing to acknowledge like,

3502
02:32:38,820 --> 02:32:41,190
what is this is actual statements.
How is he?

3503
02:32:41,340 --> 02:32:42,173
Well,
I mean the larger academic debate is 

3504
02:32:44,701 --> 02:32:45,540
like,
uh,

3505
02:32:45,541 --> 02:32:49,440
so specifically he rejects the idea 
that,

3506
02:32:49,441 --> 02:32:50,274
and it's important to realize that the 
group selection people are not denying 

3507
02:32:53,200 --> 02:32:56,190
construction,
so they're not denying Dawkins is work,

3508
02:32:56,370 --> 02:32:57,203
right?
They're building off of is work and 

3509
02:32:58,441 --> 02:33:01,140
saying there's this extra effect.
Right?

3510
02:33:02,160 --> 02:33:03,660
But how do they describe that extra 
effect?

3511
02:33:03,720 --> 02:33:06,150
They described that effect as selfish 
individuals,

3512
02:33:06,170 --> 02:33:07,003
outcompete altruistic individuals,
altruistic groups compete selfish 

3513
02:33:09,181 --> 02:33:10,014
groups.
Right?

3514
02:33:10,080 --> 02:33:10,950
But if,
if,

3515
02:33:11,010 --> 02:33:13,650
if you were to have Richard Dawkins in 
this room today,

3516
02:33:13,830 --> 02:33:15,300
he would not agree with that statement,

3517
02:33:16,970 --> 02:33:17,803
what would he think?
He would say that selection does not 

3518
02:33:20,001 --> 02:33:21,290
happen at the level of groups.

3519
02:33:22,940 --> 02:33:23,773
Hmm.

3520
02:33:24,810 --> 02:33:27,630
And will be the evidence pro and con.
Well,

3521
02:33:27,720 --> 02:33:28,553
ultimately what I would like Joe and the
reason why I called him a scientologist 

3522
02:33:32,040 --> 02:33:35,220
is because you know,
what should happen in academic debate is

3523
02:33:35,221 --> 02:33:37,320
that ideas should die,
right?

3524
02:33:37,830 --> 02:33:38,663
The point of,
of scientific progress is that you 

3525
02:33:40,290 --> 02:33:42,420
should live and die,
right?

3526
02:33:42,421 --> 02:33:46,500
It's Thunderdome to ideas.
Enter one ideas leave right now,

3527
02:33:46,920 --> 02:33:49,050
the point is,
is that that's not happening in science.

3528
02:33:49,080 --> 02:33:49,913
What's happening?
What happened to that dinner party with 

3529
02:33:51,241 --> 02:33:54,480
Richard Thaler is two ideas entered and 
two ideas left,

3530
02:33:54,900 --> 02:33:56,730
right,
and in general,

3531
02:33:56,731 --> 02:33:58,580
that's a big recurring problem in 
science.

3532
02:33:58,581 --> 02:34:03,180
It's happening in economics and it's 
also happening in evolutionary biology.

3533
02:34:03,540 --> 02:34:05,460
Now the point is is that I'm a single 
individual.

3534
02:34:05,550 --> 02:34:06,383
I can't be an expert in all the nuances 
and all the details of all of these 

3535
02:34:10,621 --> 02:34:11,454
things,
but what I can do is I can show you the 

3536
02:34:13,501 --> 02:34:14,334
general pattern that's happening and I 
can show you what the consequences are 

3537
02:34:17,651 --> 02:34:18,484
for you.

3538
02:34:18,670 --> 02:34:19,503
Have these beliefs not changing.
So the area in which I do know the most 

3539
02:34:23,320 --> 02:34:26,830
right is the area of education.
And you have some daughters,

3540
02:34:26,831 --> 02:34:28,270
I believe.
Is that true?

3541
02:34:28,660 --> 02:34:29,493
Yeah.
So these beliefs that your daughters 

3542
02:34:31,541 --> 02:34:34,600
have about their intelligence,
whatever those beliefs may be,

3543
02:34:34,601 --> 02:34:35,434
as of today,
will have a huge effect on the choices 

3544
02:34:37,241 --> 02:34:38,980
they make in school.
The choice,

3545
02:34:38,990 --> 02:34:41,830
how they do in education,
what their experience of school is,

3546
02:34:41,831 --> 02:34:43,750
whether they are happy in school,
whether they're productive,

3547
02:34:43,751 --> 02:34:44,584
whether they're successful,
and whether they're setup for a 

3548
02:34:46,271 --> 02:34:48,790
knowledge economy,
which was all about constantly learning.

3549
02:34:49,120 --> 02:34:49,953
Do they emerge from school hating school
or did they emerge from school loving 

3550
02:34:52,121 --> 02:34:52,954
school?
Do they emerge from school with 

3551
02:34:53,711 --> 02:34:54,544
confidence that they can learn what has 
there ever is required or do they feel 

3552
02:34:56,861 --> 02:34:59,320
like they can only be good at some 
things and not good at other things?

3553
02:34:59,410 --> 02:35:00,243
Before we get too far off track,
I just noticed I'm still confused as to 

3554
02:35:02,741 --> 02:35:07,510
how you feel Dawkins is ignoring the 
arguments against his work.

3555
02:35:07,540 --> 02:35:08,180
Like what?
What?

3556
02:35:08,180 --> 02:35:09,013
What are his statement?

3557
02:35:09,290 --> 02:35:11,690
He's denied.
He's denied this idea of group

3558
02:35:11,750 --> 02:35:16,120
since anybody had a debate with him 
about this secret and watch somewhere.

3559
02:35:16,140 --> 02:35:16,500
Okay.
I listen

3560
02:35:16,500 --> 02:35:16,860
to.
Well,

3561
02:35:16,860 --> 02:35:19,230
there have been debates and you know,
what has happened is,

3562
02:35:19,231 --> 02:35:21,810
is that you know,
they like for example,

3563
02:35:22,550 --> 02:35:23,383
what the debate is currently is the 
debate is currently about how many 

3564
02:35:26,461 --> 02:35:29,190
people are on each side.
So John Height,

3565
02:35:29,191 --> 02:35:30,024
for example,
was on Sam Harris' podcast and Sam 

3566
02:35:31,950 --> 02:35:33,690
Harris would agree with Richard Dawkins,
right?

3567
02:35:34,110 --> 02:35:35,560
And John Height,
you know,

3568
02:35:35,561 --> 02:35:36,900
they,
John Heightened Sam Harris,

3569
02:35:36,901 --> 02:35:38,790
disagree on multiple things,
right?

3570
02:35:38,850 --> 02:35:39,683
They've had many disagreements in the 
whole point of their podcast was to try 

3571
02:35:41,551 --> 02:35:43,710
and have a civil conversation and you 
know,

3572
02:35:43,740 --> 02:35:45,030
John Height said,
you know,

3573
02:35:45,060 --> 02:35:46,920
the difference between you and Sam,
you and I,

3574
02:35:46,950 --> 02:35:47,783
Sam,
is that I'm an intuitionist in euro 

3575
02:35:48,630 --> 02:35:50,100
rationalist,
right?

3576
02:35:50,101 --> 02:35:51,300
So Sam,
John,

3577
02:35:51,330 --> 02:35:54,060
John Height believes,
and if you look across the science,

3578
02:35:54,061 --> 02:35:54,894
I think this is what supported is that a
thief thinking and feeling are always 

3579
02:35:58,291 --> 02:35:59,124
linked.
So we're always being driven by these 

3580
02:35:59,761 --> 02:36:02,760
intuitions even if we don't always 
understand that there is,

3581
02:36:02,761 --> 02:36:04,530
on the other hand,
this idea of descartes' error,

3582
02:36:04,531 --> 02:36:06,450
which is the idea that descartes came up
with.

3583
02:36:06,460 --> 02:36:09,270
The reason and emotion are separate and 
there are a lot of.

3584
02:36:09,300 --> 02:36:12,210
That's what the rational agent theories 
about the idea that,

3585
02:36:12,211 --> 02:36:13,620
you know,
there's reason and it's,

3586
02:36:13,621 --> 02:36:16,710
it's separate from emotion.
Are these mutually incompatible though?

3587
02:36:16,740 --> 02:36:17,760
Yes.
Okay.

3588
02:36:17,910 --> 02:36:21,150
Then that's the point of science is that
you're supposed to kill certain ideas.

3589
02:36:21,151 --> 02:36:24,730
So while there's descartes' error 
specifically comes from A.

3590
02:36:24,810 --> 02:36:25,643
There's this book by Antonio Damasio at 
USC and it's based on a series of 

3591
02:36:28,021 --> 02:36:30,660
experiments around this guy named Elliot
and people like him.

3592
02:36:31,140 --> 02:36:35,790
And so elliot was this banker,
financial guy,

3593
02:36:35,791 --> 02:36:37,620
happy family man,
all this sort of stuff,

3594
02:36:38,460 --> 02:36:42,360
and he had a brain tumor and so they 
chopped it out.

3595
02:36:42,540 --> 02:36:43,373
The brain tumor was right here,
right up at the top of the base of his 

3596
02:36:45,511 --> 02:36:48,120
nose.
And at first it seemed like chopping out

3597
02:36:48,121 --> 02:36:50,100
this piece of his brain had done 
nothing,

3598
02:36:50,160 --> 02:36:51,240
right?
It hadn't effected him.

3599
02:36:51,270 --> 02:36:51,931
Oh,
totally.

3600
02:36:51,931 --> 02:36:52,764
Disposable,
bit of brain didn't really have a 

3601
02:36:54,001 --> 02:36:54,960
function.
Look at that.

3602
02:36:54,961 --> 02:36:57,630
It was just an optional accessory,
like the appendix of the brain.

3603
02:36:58,080 --> 02:36:58,913
But then what happens is that they come 
to find out that all of a sudden elliot 

3604
02:37:01,501 --> 02:37:04,650
has all these problems,
even though his Iq is unaffected,

3605
02:37:04,651 --> 02:37:08,370
even though his,
a verbal intelligence is not affected,

3606
02:37:08,371 --> 02:37:09,880
right?
What's happening is,

3607
02:37:09,881 --> 02:37:11,470
is that he,
um,

3608
02:37:12,150 --> 02:37:13,890
he's making all these terrible 
decisions.

3609
02:37:14,280 --> 02:37:17,960
He leaves his wife for a stripper,
he snopes.

3610
02:37:19,670 --> 02:37:20,503
That's actually who Elliott is.
He's the snopes guy and it's because he 

3611
02:37:24,051 --> 02:37:25,350
had cancer.
So don't make fun of him.

3612
02:37:25,550 --> 02:37:26,383
Um,
yeah.

3613
02:37:27,260 --> 02:37:28,010
But,
um,

3614
02:37:28,010 --> 02:37:28,910
you know,
he,

3615
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:30,080
uh,
his business,

3616
02:37:30,160 --> 02:37:30,993
he starts speaking,
he was business decision making falls 

3617
02:37:32,601 --> 02:37:34,550
apart.
He falls for all these conmen,

3618
02:37:34,820 --> 02:37:35,653
he's making all these horrible choices 
and he can't decide where to go to 

3619
02:37:37,461 --> 02:37:38,294
lunch.
So what ends up happening is is that an 

3620
02:37:39,891 --> 02:37:40,491
11:00
AM,

3621
02:37:40,491 --> 02:37:45,320
he'll try and decide where am I going to
go to lunch and then by 4:00

3622
02:37:45,320 --> 02:37:46,153
PM lunches past and that's because he 
sat around and tried to calculate 

3623
02:37:48,861 --> 02:37:50,390
rationally where should I go to lunch?

3624
02:37:50,420 --> 02:37:51,350
Right?
He thought about,

3625
02:37:51,380 --> 02:37:52,213
oh,
should I go like based on tables and 

3626
02:37:54,891 --> 02:37:58,190
calories and all this sort of stuff,
and he couldn't make a decision.

3627
02:37:58,280 --> 02:37:59,113
And the reason why is because this bit 
of the brain that was removed turns out 

3628
02:38:01,611 --> 02:38:02,444
is what links thinking and feeling.
It's your ventral medial prefrontal 

3629
02:38:05,841 --> 02:38:10,841
cortex and deciding where to go to lunch
is influenced constantly by our emotions

3630
02:38:11,540 --> 02:38:12,440
because you know,
you have,

3631
02:38:12,470 --> 02:38:13,303
you feel like tie or you know,
you feel like something light or you 

3632
02:38:16,581 --> 02:38:18,740
feel like a meatball sub or whatever it 
may be,

3633
02:38:18,741 --> 02:38:20,570
where you feel like if you go to this 
restaurant,

3634
02:38:20,780 --> 02:38:23,210
you'll run into that really hot waitress
or whatever it may be.

3635
02:38:24,110 --> 02:38:24,943
So that along with the work of Daniel 
Kahneman and Amos Tversky and the work 

3636
02:38:29,631 --> 02:38:30,464
of people like John Height,
there's now an immense amount of 

3637
02:38:32,781 --> 02:38:33,614
information that basically understands 
that descartes who lived 400 years ago 

3638
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:41,210
was making shit up when he came up with 
his theory of the brain,

3639
02:38:41,510 --> 02:38:42,080
right?

3640
02:38:42,080 --> 02:38:44,870
And his theory of the brain of this idea
of reason and emotion,

3641
02:38:44,871 --> 02:38:47,870
which has floated around in the West for
ages and ages and ages.

3642
02:38:48,380 --> 02:38:50,660
It doesn't fit the evidence.
Now,

3643
02:38:51,170 --> 02:38:53,510
that's the basic problem is that,
and I will tell you,

3644
02:38:53,540 --> 02:38:57,770
having worked with students,
your ability to improve their lives,

3645
02:38:57,771 --> 02:39:00,290
once you understand that thinking and 
feeling are always linked,

3646
02:39:00,590 --> 02:39:03,830
goes massively up because now when a 
student starts telling me,

3647
02:39:03,831 --> 02:39:05,270
Oh,
I don't have the math gene,

3648
02:39:05,480 --> 02:39:07,280
or I don't have a natural ear for 
languages,

3649
02:39:07,570 --> 02:39:10,070
I don't waste my time dealing with that 
rationalization.

3650
02:39:10,250 --> 02:39:13,340
Instead I asked the kid,
how do you feel about math?

3651
02:39:13,400 --> 02:39:15,470
Right?
How do you feel about your teacher?

3652
02:39:15,471 --> 02:39:16,304
And we start to deal with the feelings 
and we start to sort through the 

3653
02:39:17,841 --> 02:39:18,674
feelings until we get the feelings lined
up in such a way that you're making the 

3654
02:39:21,231 --> 02:39:22,190
right choices.

3655
02:39:22,550 --> 02:39:24,020
And that's,
that's for me,

3656
02:39:24,021 --> 02:39:25,760
the heart is that there.
That's,

3657
02:39:25,790 --> 02:39:30,180
that's the problem that I first came to 
this from was education and all this,

3658
02:39:30,270 --> 02:39:31,850
talking about these kids though.
Sorry to interrupt you,

3659
02:39:31,851 --> 02:39:32,684
but it seems almost like a.
you're talking about a user operator 

3660
02:39:34,311 --> 02:39:35,144
error.
It's like they're just programmed 

3661
02:39:36,591 --> 02:39:40,040
incorrectly to know how to view the 
world by their culture.

3662
02:39:40,790 --> 02:39:43,990
Their culture is fucking them and 
setting and know.

3663
02:39:44,040 --> 02:39:44,600
And it's.
And,

3664
02:39:44,600 --> 02:39:45,730
and that's what you have to understand 
is,

3665
02:39:45,731 --> 02:39:46,700
is that,
you know,

3666
02:39:47,030 --> 02:39:51,410
that's human hardware doesn't.
Human hardware has not really changed in

3667
02:39:51,411 --> 02:39:54,860
the last hundred thousand years.
But human software,

3668
02:39:54,861 --> 02:39:57,800
the culture that we picked up has 
evolved over time.

3669
02:39:58,190 --> 02:40:00,320
It's constantly changing.
It's constantly changing.

3670
02:40:00,321 --> 02:40:01,154
And now especially because the 
environment is changing so fast because 

3671
02:40:03,651 --> 02:40:05,020
of technology and all these sorts of 
things,

3672
02:40:05,210 --> 02:40:06,043
chat filters,
we need to change the culture fast and 

3673
02:40:08,241 --> 02:40:11,120
we need to change the culture 
intentionally and so.

3674
02:40:11,120 --> 02:40:13,560
But who decides how the culture gets 
changed?

3675
02:40:13,561 --> 02:40:15,420
Is it Donald Trump or is it another 
month?

3676
02:40:15,790 --> 02:40:18,480
And it's not either of us,
it should be the group.

3677
02:40:18,690 --> 02:40:21,120
Right?
And the point is to spark a conversation

3678
02:40:21,121 --> 02:40:24,230
so that we can have this conversation.
But the point is,

3679
02:40:24,231 --> 02:40:25,064
is there are certain academics who are 
going to try and stand in the way of 

3680
02:40:28,051 --> 02:40:28,884
that conversation and will use their 
authority to try and shut down that 

3681
02:40:31,411 --> 02:40:32,244
conversation because they're trying to 
defend their pet theory in whatever 

3682
02:40:35,341 --> 02:40:36,174
discipline it is.
And this is where you come back to 

3683
02:40:37,081 --> 02:40:38,430
Dawkins,
and this is Dawkins,

3684
02:40:38,431 --> 02:40:40,350
but I,
the point is to recognize it's not about

3685
02:40:40,351 --> 02:40:41,184
Dawkins particularly.
And if you want to get into the woods 

3686
02:40:43,861 --> 02:40:44,694
on,
like,

3687
02:40:44,790 --> 02:40:45,623
you know,
all of the nuances of all of this sort 

3688
02:40:47,071 --> 02:40:47,904
of stuff.
You should get on either David Sloan 

3689
02:40:49,620 --> 02:40:50,453
Wilson or John Heider,
Joe Henrich and they can like take you 

3690
02:40:52,201 --> 02:40:53,100
through the whole thing.

3691
02:40:53,670 --> 02:40:56,160
But um,
and the basic problem is,

3692
02:40:56,161 --> 02:40:57,960
is that there's a lot of science that is
really,

3693
02:40:57,961 --> 02:41:00,030
really useful.
But you know,

3694
02:41:00,031 --> 02:41:03,660
one man can't figure it all out.
Impossible.

3695
02:41:03,750 --> 02:41:06,960
Impossible.
And you can't hold onto a theory.

3696
02:41:07,200 --> 02:41:09,750
No,
you have to expose it to the marketplace

3697
02:41:09,751 --> 02:41:13,500
of ideas.
It has to be tested and what I can do,

3698
02:41:13,530 --> 02:41:14,363
because there's a lot of this comes down
to what's permissible in the culture of 

3699
02:41:16,141 --> 02:41:18,690
science.
So if you've got guys like,

3700
02:41:18,691 --> 02:41:19,524
you know,
you can go if you want to go and like 

3701
02:41:20,610 --> 02:41:23,430
read about what David Sloan Wilson is 
saying and all of these guys,

3702
02:41:23,670 --> 02:41:25,770
you can either go read their books which
are excellent,

3703
02:41:25,970 --> 02:41:26,803
but you can also go to David Sloan 
Wilson because he has also seen 

3704
02:41:29,671 --> 02:41:30,504
practically how much of these ideas can 
make a difference in people's lives and 

3705
02:41:33,571 --> 02:41:34,404
actually make people's lives better.
He's also trying to popularize the 

3706
02:41:36,681 --> 02:41:36,990
science.

3707
02:41:36,990 --> 02:41:39,240
So he has a whole website,
you know,

3708
02:41:39,241 --> 02:41:42,060
this view of life and economics and all 
this sort of stuff.

3709
02:41:42,350 --> 02:41:45,240
And if you want,
there's a great article by Peter Turchin

3710
02:41:45,241 --> 02:41:49,230
who's another guy and he'll take you 
through some of the stuff around Dawkins

3711
02:41:49,231 --> 02:41:51,900
and all this stuff.
But what my,

3712
02:41:51,930 --> 02:41:52,763
my goal with all of this stuff with 
Thomas Soul's work with David Sloan 

3713
02:41:56,850 --> 02:41:57,670
Wilson,
John Height,

3714
02:41:57,670 --> 02:41:58,503
you know Carol dwecks work was just a 
lot of this education stuff is that I 

3715
02:42:01,351 --> 02:42:04,320
know that it's not realistic to expect 
people to.

3716
02:42:04,380 --> 02:42:06,240
That I can't just like put a list on the
Internet,

3717
02:42:06,300 --> 02:42:09,060
have 50 books and be like everybody has 
to read these 50 bucks.

3718
02:42:09,061 --> 02:42:10,560
Like people have other shit to worry 
about.

3719
02:42:10,830 --> 02:42:11,630
Right?
Yeah.

3720
02:42:11,630 --> 02:42:14,190
But if you don't concern yourself with 
that,

3721
02:42:14,191 --> 02:42:17,970
I've just suggested enough people will.
The ideas will start to permeate.

3722
02:42:18,150 --> 02:42:20,580
But you also what your,
what you run into.

3723
02:42:20,580 --> 02:42:23,370
And this is part of what I've run into 
with education right,

3724
02:42:23,670 --> 02:42:24,660
is so,
you know,

3725
02:42:24,661 --> 02:42:26,880
along with Katie,
my Bostonian friend,

3726
02:42:27,180 --> 02:42:28,013
we took seven different fields of 
neuroscience and psychology and we 

3727
02:42:30,691 --> 02:42:31,524
condensed them all into one book that we
wrote to the teenager because we wanted 

3728
02:42:34,561 --> 02:42:35,394
to have a message.
Problem is most of these books are 

3729
02:42:36,631 --> 02:42:39,060
written to adults and you write the book
to the adult,

3730
02:42:39,090 --> 02:42:41,190
the adult reads it,
the parent reads that and they're like,

3731
02:42:41,430 --> 02:42:42,330
oh,
this is so great.

3732
02:42:42,360 --> 02:42:45,540
And then now they're in the 
uncomfortable position of having to have

3733
02:42:45,541 --> 02:42:48,540
a conversation about school with kids 
and then the ideas die.

3734
02:42:48,541 --> 02:42:50,730
The idea is don't move.
So we were like,

3735
02:42:50,790 --> 02:42:54,030
let's skip the middle man and let or 
middle woman and let's write straight to

3736
02:42:54,031 --> 02:42:55,830
the kid.
What's the book is called the straight a

3737
02:42:55,831 --> 02:42:56,664
conspiracy.
And the reason why we called it the 

3738
02:42:58,351 --> 02:42:59,184
straight a conspiracy is because we,
at the time we're working with the son 

3739
02:43:01,980 --> 02:43:06,420
of a guy named Stan Rogo who was the 
executive producer on Lizzie Mcguire.

3740
02:43:06,780 --> 02:43:07,890
And we'd been.
I mean,

3741
02:43:07,891 --> 02:43:09,780
this is the power of emotions by the 
way,

3742
02:43:09,810 --> 02:43:11,070
like super predators.
Lizzie,

3743
02:43:11,680 --> 02:43:14,140
Lizzie mcguire was like that hate hilary
duff,

3744
02:43:14,170 --> 02:43:15,850
a kids' TV show.
Oh,

3745
02:43:15,851 --> 02:43:17,800
okay.
In the nineties it was like super big.

3746
02:43:17,801 --> 02:43:20,830
It was the miley cyrus of like or early 
two thousands I think.

3747
02:43:21,790 --> 02:43:23,110
But anyway,
so we,

3748
02:43:23,140 --> 02:43:23,973
you know,
we were struggling with how do you have 

3749
02:43:25,811 --> 02:43:26,644
a conversation about education in school
and your potential and all these sorts 

3750
02:43:29,561 --> 02:43:31,510
of things with kids.
And you know,

3751
02:43:31,511 --> 02:43:32,344
our intuitions are,
we're sort of the classic teacher 

3752
02:43:33,791 --> 02:43:35,020
intuitions,
which is like,

3753
02:43:35,021 --> 02:43:37,030
you can do it.
You're amazing,

3754
02:43:37,031 --> 02:43:37,864
like you have so much potential.
And we had sat down with Stan and Stan 

3755
02:43:41,801 --> 02:43:42,401
said,
listen,

3756
02:43:42,401 --> 02:43:46,810
I've been making kids' tv for a long 
time and if I've learned one thing about

3757
02:43:46,811 --> 02:43:48,070
teenagers,
it's this,

3758
02:43:48,250 --> 02:43:49,083
their lives suck.
They may not suck at any sort of 

3759
02:43:51,011 --> 02:43:51,844
objective sense or any sort of 
geographical sense or anything like 

3760
02:43:54,731 --> 02:43:57,010
that,
but on an emotional subjective level,

3761
02:43:57,220 --> 02:43:58,053
they suck.

3762
02:43:58,150 --> 02:44:01,750
And so the only thing you could ever 
tell them that they will believe is that

3763
02:44:01,751 --> 02:44:05,710
they've been lied to.
And so that's what we did.

3764
02:44:05,770 --> 02:44:06,760
And he said,
your,

3765
02:44:06,761 --> 02:44:09,250
the title of your book is the something 
conspiracy.

3766
02:44:09,400 --> 02:44:10,870
I don't know what it is.
Right?

3767
02:44:11,140 --> 02:44:13,810
And so we went away and we did the 
straight a conspiracy.

3768
02:44:14,230 --> 02:44:16,330
And rather than getting kids to believe 
them,

3769
02:44:16,450 --> 02:44:18,970
believe in themselves,
we got them to doubt their doubts.

3770
02:44:19,630 --> 02:44:20,463
And once you got them doubting their 
doubts and you know all the things that 

3771
02:44:23,561 --> 02:44:26,500
they believed about math genes,
is that really true?

3772
02:44:26,530 --> 02:44:28,720
How do we know that brow like,
is that really,

3773
02:44:28,721 --> 02:44:29,980
you know,
all that sort of stuff.

3774
02:44:30,280 --> 02:44:31,113
And then you get that process where they
are now starting to question things and 

3775
02:44:34,061 --> 02:44:34,894
you know,
we did the first chapter is all about 

3776
02:44:36,071 --> 02:44:37,500
genius myths,
um,

3777
02:44:37,660 --> 02:44:38,680
which are,
you know,

3778
02:44:39,430 --> 02:44:41,560
essentially very clever marketing 
schemes that again,

3779
02:44:41,561 --> 02:44:43,000
rely on that thing of all.

3780
02:44:43,330 --> 02:44:46,050
So if you look at someone like Steve 
Jobs,

3781
02:44:46,051 --> 02:44:49,060
right?
Steve Jobs was very smart marketer,

3782
02:44:49,061 --> 02:44:50,830
right?
And He created this image,

3783
02:44:50,860 --> 02:44:53,890
right?
This cult of personality around himself,

3784
02:44:54,100 --> 02:44:55,030
which is that,
you know,

3785
02:44:55,031 --> 02:44:59,200
he made himself seem like this genius 
who out of nowhere came out of all these

3786
02:44:59,201 --> 02:45:00,034
things,
people call them the I got and the cult 

3787
02:45:01,511 --> 02:45:05,140
of Mac and what is the effect of all the
effect of all his blind copying.

3788
02:45:05,170 --> 02:45:06,003
We just had to have that Mac product.
And in that he was copying the playbook 

3789
02:45:09,851 --> 02:45:11,320
of another guy much,
much earlier,

3790
02:45:11,470 --> 02:45:12,303
Thomas Edison,
who in his own time created this own 

3791
02:45:14,321 --> 02:45:15,154
cult of personality around himself.
And at the time he was known as the 

3792
02:45:16,961 --> 02:45:19,450
wizard of Menlo Park.
But in reality,

3793
02:45:19,480 --> 02:45:21,130
did Edison invented the light bulb?
No,

3794
02:45:21,131 --> 02:45:21,964
he did not.
The light bulb was around 45 years 

3795
02:45:23,411 --> 02:45:25,860
before he was even born,
ripped off Tesla.

3796
02:45:27,510 --> 02:45:28,343
You watch drunk history.
I received Duncan trussell's version of 

3797
02:45:31,190 --> 02:45:32,023
history.
It's all on Nikola Tesla and Thomas 

3798
02:45:34,210 --> 02:45:35,440
Edison.
Thomas Edison,

3799
02:45:35,441 --> 02:45:36,390
and being a con.
Yeah,

3800
02:45:36,420 --> 02:45:38,680
it's amazing.
And so,

3801
02:45:38,770 --> 02:45:40,480
um,
and that's the point is that,

3802
02:45:40,510 --> 02:45:41,200
you know,
these,

3803
02:45:41,200 --> 02:45:43,150
these,
these people were people and you know,

3804
02:45:43,600 --> 02:45:47,620
the myths that you have about geniuses 
are actually clever advertising schemes.

3805
02:45:47,890 --> 02:45:50,200
But the problem is,
is that it's an ad jingle that,

3806
02:45:50,230 --> 02:45:54,490
that is so good that we've essentially 
had that jingle trapped in our heads for

3807
02:45:54,491 --> 02:45:58,120
hundreds and hundreds of years.
So there are ideas that are passed on,

3808
02:45:58,121 --> 02:46:00,850
like Edison had a thousand patents to 
his name before he,

3809
02:46:00,880 --> 02:46:02,950
by the time he died,
he did.

3810
02:46:03,190 --> 02:46:05,560
That's because when you set up an 
industrial research lab,

3811
02:46:05,561 --> 02:46:06,394
you make sure that your name is on all 
the patents because that's the whole 

3812
02:46:08,651 --> 02:46:10,640
point of employing a bunch of people is 
that,

3813
02:46:10,670 --> 02:46:12,230
you know,
you want to own the Ip.

3814
02:46:12,620 --> 02:46:13,920
And that's true for,
you know,

3815
02:46:13,940 --> 02:46:16,850
Mozart was the Michael Jackson of the 17
hundreds.

3816
02:46:17,060 --> 02:46:18,620
Isaac Newton,
you know,

3817
02:46:18,650 --> 02:46:21,710
they basically knew that they couldn't 
sell the ideas of gravity,

3818
02:46:21,711 --> 02:46:22,544
so they sold Newton is the man,
this guy who had this great vision and 

3819
02:46:25,430 --> 02:46:26,230
Blah Blah,
blah,

3820
02:46:26,230 --> 02:46:28,430
and the story of the apple and all that 
bullshit,

3821
02:46:28,640 --> 02:46:30,020
and then Einstein,
you know,

3822
02:46:30,021 --> 02:46:30,854
they needed to package the new physics 
that was being done by lots and lots of 

3823
02:46:33,381 --> 02:46:36,230
physicist Heisenberg and planck and all 
that sort of stuff.

3824
02:46:36,470 --> 02:46:38,090
But there was this guy,
Arthur Eddington,

3825
02:46:38,091 --> 02:46:42,470
who knew he couldn't sell that,
so he sold the idea of a boy wonder with

3826
02:46:42,471 --> 02:46:46,640
crazy hair who had beaten Newton and was
displacing Newton.

3827
02:46:46,910 --> 02:46:49,370
Now the point is you go and you talk to 
physicists and they'll tell you,

3828
02:46:49,371 --> 02:46:50,780
well,
it's not really true.

3829
02:46:50,781 --> 02:46:52,760
Like Einstein didn't really displace 
Newton,

3830
02:46:52,761 --> 02:46:54,770
right?
We still use newtonian mechanics.

3831
02:46:54,920 --> 02:46:58,130
We only use Einsteinian mechanics when 
we start to get near the speed of light,

3832
02:46:58,280 --> 02:47:00,170
right?
So there are all these marketing,

3833
02:47:00,260 --> 02:47:01,880
the marketing schemes,
right?

3834
02:47:02,840 --> 02:47:06,510
But in the marketplace of ideas,
part of what happens is,

3835
02:47:06,511 --> 02:47:10,580
is that there are these big public 
intellectuals like Richard Dawkins,

3836
02:47:10,730 --> 02:47:11,563
right?
And they have a lot of power and it 

3837
02:47:13,701 --> 02:47:15,400
becomes very difficult to challenge 
them.

3838
02:47:15,401 --> 02:47:16,234
And in particular,
I don't think that anybody particularly 

3839
02:47:18,381 --> 02:47:20,780
wants to go up against Richard Dawkins.
Right?

3840
02:47:21,100 --> 02:47:23,330
He's a sacred cow.
He is a sacred cow.

3841
02:47:23,331 --> 02:47:26,420
And if you go up against the new 
atheists or you challenge anything about

3842
02:47:26,421 --> 02:47:27,950
the new atheists.
And I have,

3843
02:47:28,250 --> 02:47:28,761
I,
you know,

3844
02:47:28,761 --> 02:47:31,850
I like the,
the whole rationalist intuitionist thing

3845
02:47:32,090 --> 02:47:35,420
because I've been trying to talk about 
emotions on our podcast.

3846
02:47:35,690 --> 02:47:36,840
And I said,
you know,

3847
02:47:36,890 --> 02:47:37,521
hey,
look,

3848
02:47:37,521 --> 02:47:40,340
you don't have to believe me,
there's this Guy John Height,

3849
02:47:40,341 --> 02:47:42,800
who's a big famous scientists and all 
that stuff.

3850
02:47:42,800 --> 02:47:43,633
And then there's this guy,
Sam Harris who has a phd in 

3851
02:47:45,111 --> 02:47:45,944
neuroscience,
but John Height is saying rationalist 

3852
02:47:47,991 --> 02:47:49,700
versus intuitionist.
There's a difference.

3853
02:47:49,730 --> 02:47:50,563
Right?
And I want to talk about that and I'm 

3854
02:47:51,771 --> 02:47:53,930
going to tell you that I think that in 
light of the evidence,

3855
02:47:53,931 --> 02:47:54,764
Sam Harris was wrong and I got a whole 
bunch of angry tweets from a guy named 

3856
02:47:58,190 --> 02:48:03,050
at Atheist Sensei proceeded to tell me 
that I was a fucking idiot,

3857
02:48:03,051 --> 02:48:03,441
and blah,
blah,

3858
02:48:03,441 --> 02:48:04,274
blah.
And what did I know and how arrogant I 

3859
02:48:05,211 --> 02:48:07,580
was and how dare you and all this sort 
of stuff.

3860
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:10,910
But once you understand your argument,
he didn't really.

3861
02:48:10,940 --> 02:48:11,773
So what did he just jump at you because 
of the fact that you're questioning his 

3862
02:48:15,050 --> 02:48:18,170
boy.
He basically and then what?

3863
02:48:18,171 --> 02:48:20,220
I man his man and.
But it was,

3864
02:48:20,230 --> 02:48:21,020
it was,
it was,

3865
02:48:21,020 --> 02:48:25,370
it was productive because what he said 
is he said,

3866
02:48:25,371 --> 02:48:27,020
what are you even talking about?

3867
02:48:27,500 --> 02:48:32,500
Sam Harris knows that most people are 
being emotional most of the time,

3868
02:48:33,950 --> 02:48:37,580
but the issue isn't what Sam Harris 
knows about other people.

3869
02:48:37,760 --> 02:48:40,550
It's what a Sam Harris believe about his
own brain.

3870
02:48:40,880 --> 02:48:43,010
Right?
And Sam Harris,

3871
02:48:43,090 --> 02:48:43,923
he's really.
And this is not sam's fault as an 

3872
02:48:45,681 --> 02:48:46,514
individual,
just as none of the cultural stuff that 

3873
02:48:47,811 --> 02:48:50,030
we've been talking about is his fault.
I,

3874
02:48:50,090 --> 02:48:50,923
when I was in college,
I also believed in this whole idea of 

3875
02:48:54,681 --> 02:48:56,720
descartes' error,
that reason and emotion are separate.

3876
02:48:57,020 --> 02:48:57,853
And then I moved out to la and I was in 
an acting class and I moved from an 

3877
02:49:01,611 --> 02:49:05,690
environment that worshiped reason to an 
environment that worshiped emotion,

3878
02:49:05,810 --> 02:49:07,500
right?
That's what actors do all day.

3879
02:49:07,501 --> 02:49:08,334
They fucking talk about their feelings 
and so for somebody who had come from 

3880
02:49:11,671 --> 02:49:14,670
that environment,
it was super fucking annoying.

3881
02:49:14,730 --> 02:49:15,563
I found actors really,
really annoying because they would not 

3882
02:49:17,251 --> 02:49:19,080
stop talking about their feelings and it
pissed me off.

3883
02:49:19,080 --> 02:49:20,160
It pissed me off.
It pissed me off.

3884
02:49:20,490 --> 02:49:23,070
And the certain point I got so annoyed,
I was like,

3885
02:49:23,071 --> 02:49:26,400
you fuckers don't know what the fuck 
you're talking about.

3886
02:49:26,640 --> 02:49:29,280
The only real authorities are 
scientists.

3887
02:49:29,610 --> 02:49:32,220
So what did I do?
I went off and I read the scientists and

3888
02:49:32,221 --> 02:49:35,760
I found out that the actors were right 
and it was fucking humiliating.

3889
02:49:35,761 --> 02:49:37,380
I don't understand where they were,
right?

3890
02:49:37,381 --> 02:49:39,720
How they were,
right about the importance of emotions.

3891
02:49:39,840 --> 02:49:42,240
Emotions are hugely important.
They drive thinking,

3892
02:49:42,390 --> 02:49:43,223
yeah,
but that's not what these actors are 

3893
02:49:44,221 --> 02:49:45,450
doing.
I understand that,

3894
02:49:45,660 --> 02:49:46,493
you know,
they're just being emotional because 

3895
02:49:48,211 --> 02:49:49,044
it's indulgent.
They're being indulgent and they're not 

3896
02:49:50,971 --> 02:49:53,790
managing their emotions,
which is what you're supposed to do,

3897
02:49:54,270 --> 02:49:56,100
but what you find,
for example.

3898
02:49:56,101 --> 02:49:58,050
So here's a simple thing,
um,

3899
02:49:58,400 --> 02:49:59,233
you know,
there's a reason why we say that and 

3900
02:50:01,410 --> 02:50:02,243
then you know,
that intersected with working with 

3901
02:50:03,181 --> 02:50:03,930
students,
right?

3902
02:50:03,930 --> 02:50:06,000
So if you say,
for example,

3903
02:50:06,001 --> 02:50:07,830
students say,
I feel stupid,

3904
02:50:08,230 --> 02:50:10,770
turns out that stupid is a feeling 
specifically,

3905
02:50:10,771 --> 02:50:12,780
it's the feeling of shame,
right?

3906
02:50:13,140 --> 02:50:13,973
And so,
and also being ineffective in your 

3907
02:50:15,481 --> 02:50:18,720
intellectual pursuits and a sense of 
helplessness and all that sort of stuff,

3908
02:50:18,780 --> 02:50:20,310
but feel inadequate.
That's right.

3909
02:50:20,400 --> 02:50:21,233
And it's specifically,
it's a feeling called learned 

3910
02:50:22,501 --> 02:50:23,550
helplessness,
right?

3911
02:50:23,880 --> 02:50:24,713
In,
in academic circles where there are 

3912
02:50:25,951 --> 02:50:27,630
terrible names for everything,
right?

3913
02:50:27,870 --> 02:50:28,950
So,
um,

3914
02:50:28,980 --> 02:50:29,813
but the,
the feeling of shame motivates a very 

3915
02:50:31,291 --> 02:50:34,110
specific behavior which is that you 
avoid the source of their shame,

3916
02:50:34,140 --> 02:50:37,470
your shame.
So when students get back a bad test,

3917
02:50:37,530 --> 02:50:41,180
what they do is they want it up and they
throw it away and they avoid math.

3918
02:50:41,250 --> 02:50:42,720
They avoid math.
Right?

3919
02:50:43,050 --> 02:50:44,170
Now,
the point is,

3920
02:50:44,171 --> 02:50:45,004
is that that is that behavior is 
literally the worst response you can 

3921
02:50:48,901 --> 02:50:51,180
have to failure,
right?

3922
02:50:51,570 --> 02:50:53,910
If you're screwing up in math or any 
other subject,

3923
02:50:53,911 --> 02:50:55,920
what you should be doing is getting out 
your mistakes,

3924
02:50:56,280 --> 02:50:59,070
analyzing your mistakes and using them 
to get better,

3925
02:50:59,430 --> 02:51:03,330
and so that very simple thing is what we
did with all of our students.

3926
02:51:03,330 --> 02:51:05,970
We sat them down,
we made them confront their mistakes.

3927
02:51:05,971 --> 02:51:06,930
We made them say,
okay,

3928
02:51:06,931 --> 02:51:09,000
number three,
why did you get number three wrong?

3929
02:51:09,060 --> 02:51:11,160
And then you figure out why number three
is wrong,

3930
02:51:11,370 --> 02:51:12,510
and then you fix that.
Now,

3931
02:51:12,511 --> 02:51:14,430
how does this oppose what Sam Harris 
believes?

3932
02:51:14,780 --> 02:51:17,310
The point is is that does Sam does.
If,

3933
02:51:17,340 --> 02:51:20,820
if an atheist Sensei,
and I will tell you that I think that an

3934
02:51:20,821 --> 02:51:25,680
atheist Sensei is pretty right in,
is a sense in his assessment of what Sam

3935
02:51:25,680 --> 02:51:26,513
Harris believes about.
Like most people are emotional most of 

3936
02:51:28,921 --> 02:51:29,754
the time,
but I don't think that Sam Harris 

3937
02:51:31,021 --> 02:51:31,854
believes that thinking and feeling are 
always linked so that his brain is all 

3938
02:51:35,521 --> 02:51:37,380
know this for a fact.
Have you discussed this with him?

3939
02:51:37,381 --> 02:51:40,080
Because I know I'm getting a text from 
him and about fucking five minutes.

3940
02:51:40,081 --> 02:51:41,700
I'll tell you for example.
Okay,

3941
02:51:41,701 --> 02:51:46,701
so how does Sam Harris feel about God or
how does Sam Harris feel about religion?

3942
02:51:50,640 --> 02:51:51,473
That's a pretty open ended question.
He doesn't believe in religion and I 

3943
02:51:54,661 --> 02:51:57,660
don't think he necessarily believes in 
any form of a deity.

3944
02:51:57,780 --> 02:51:58,490
Well,
let's talk.

3945
02:51:58,490 --> 02:52:00,780
There's no evidence for that.
Let's talk about it.

3946
02:52:00,840 --> 02:52:02,700
I know that you have a relationship with
Sam,

3947
02:52:02,730 --> 02:52:04,470
but that's okay.
But forget about that.

3948
02:52:04,550 --> 02:52:07,810
Why those questions?
And so if you look at,

3949
02:52:07,840 --> 02:52:08,920
let's look at,
for example,

3950
02:52:08,950 --> 02:52:10,210
you know your,
your friends,

3951
02:52:10,211 --> 02:52:11,740
the narco capitalists,
right?

3952
02:52:11,980 --> 02:52:13,300
And Libertarians,
right?

3953
02:52:13,540 --> 02:52:15,910
Who just want to get rid of government,
right?

3954
02:52:16,030 --> 02:52:17,770
And they're just trying to get rid of 
all government,

3955
02:52:17,980 --> 02:52:19,570
right?
So what is that?

3956
02:52:19,630 --> 02:52:21,160
What is that?
Thinking about?

3957
02:52:21,161 --> 02:52:25,240
What does that psychology about or any 
sort of a or Muslim fundamentalists,

3958
02:52:25,241 --> 02:52:27,220
they just want to get rid of these 
western influences.

3959
02:52:27,430 --> 02:52:28,263
They basically think that a certain 
thing is bad and they're constantly 

3960
02:52:30,101 --> 02:52:31,420
trying to strip it out,
strip it out,

3961
02:52:31,421 --> 02:52:32,260
strip it out,
strip it out.

3962
02:52:32,740 --> 02:52:33,573
That's the nature of fundamentalism.
And Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris are 

3963
02:52:37,571 --> 02:52:38,404
atheist fundamentalists and specifically
Richard Dawkins has talked about 

3964
02:52:41,291 --> 02:52:42,124
militant atheism that you know,
and Richard Dawkins has said that 

3965
02:52:44,201 --> 02:52:48,370
religion is the scourge of humanity and 
that we need to get rid of religion.

3966
02:52:48,790 --> 02:52:49,930
Now,
in reality,

3967
02:52:49,931 --> 02:52:50,764
if you look at the scientific evidence,
what you're going to find out is that 

3968
02:52:53,831 --> 02:52:56,620
religion has a very checkered past,
right?

3969
02:52:56,920 --> 02:52:57,880
And that it's,
you know,

3970
02:52:57,881 --> 02:53:00,220
that religion has a,
you know,

3971
02:53:00,310 --> 02:53:02,680
in terms of the history of violence,
right?

3972
02:53:02,681 --> 02:53:03,514
Steven pinker has this book,
the better angels of our nature and he 

3973
02:53:05,861 --> 02:53:07,360
talks about the fact that,
you know,

3974
02:53:07,361 --> 02:53:08,194
the,
what the new atheists are saying about 

3975
02:53:09,131 --> 02:53:11,140
religion is not supported by the 
evidence,

3976
02:53:11,440 --> 02:53:13,030
right?
That in history,

3977
02:53:13,031 --> 02:53:15,760
religion has not been any one thing,
right?

3978
02:53:15,761 --> 02:53:17,080
It's,
it's had some good things,

3979
02:53:17,081 --> 02:53:17,914
it's had some bad things.
So that's not a scientifically 

3980
02:53:19,901 --> 02:53:20,734
appropriate belief to go around and 
saying that religion is the scourge of 

3981
02:53:23,111 --> 02:53:26,530
all humanity or to be waging war about 
over religion.

3982
02:53:26,700 --> 02:53:30,880
You're talking about Dawkins and Sam 
Harris and all that sort of stuff.

3983
02:53:31,120 --> 02:53:33,870
And particularly Dawkins,
because he's the most militant them.

3984
02:53:33,950 --> 02:53:34,783
Right?
Right.

3985
02:53:35,080 --> 02:53:36,430
Separately,
you know,

3986
02:53:36,431 --> 02:53:39,850
why do people believe in religion?
What is religion really about?

3987
02:53:40,120 --> 02:53:43,120
Right.
It's because people don't understand how

3988
02:53:43,121 --> 02:53:43,954
to control their environment and so 
their minds fill in and they're trying 

3989
02:53:46,421 --> 02:53:50,320
to make sense of how do we get the 
things that we also like all the rest of

3990
02:53:50,321 --> 02:53:51,640
culture,
it's passed down.

3991
02:53:51,641 --> 02:53:52,474
That's learned behavior and imitating 
atmospheres and adopting predetermined 

3992
02:53:55,991 --> 02:53:57,050
patterns of behavior.
Yeah.

3993
02:53:57,250 --> 02:53:58,570
And thinking.
Exactly.

3994
02:53:58,600 --> 02:54:01,690
And so if you,
if you know Dawkins and Sam Harris,

3995
02:54:01,691 --> 02:54:03,070
their stated objective,
right?

3996
02:54:03,071 --> 02:54:07,780
As they want to promote evolution right 
now I taught,

3997
02:54:07,840 --> 02:54:08,673
I had to tutor some students who were at
a Christian school that taught 

3998
02:54:11,831 --> 02:54:16,330
creationism and it's oaks Christian in 
thousand oaks.

3999
02:54:16,360 --> 02:54:19,900
Right.
And I had never like honestly,

4000
02:54:19,930 --> 02:54:20,763
like pre doing that experience,
I had never thought much about the new 

4001
02:54:23,621 --> 02:54:25,540
atheists,
like they just weren't a big deal.

4002
02:54:25,540 --> 02:54:26,291
I was like,
okay,

4003
02:54:26,291 --> 02:54:28,540
those guys are out doing whatever 
they're doing.

4004
02:54:28,630 --> 02:54:29,463
Right.
And then I went into this Christian 

4005
02:54:31,031 --> 02:54:31,864
fundamentalist school or whatever it is,
or school that teaches creationism and 

4006
02:54:34,510 --> 02:54:37,630
all they could talk about was Richard 
Dawkins and Sam Harris.

4007
02:54:38,200 --> 02:54:39,033
Right?
They were talking about them constantly 

4008
02:54:40,270 --> 02:54:44,170
and in their minds,
Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris represent

4009
02:54:44,171 --> 02:54:47,230
science.
They are the face of science in the same

4010
02:54:47,231 --> 02:54:48,070
way that,
you know,

4011
02:54:48,071 --> 02:54:53,071
some guy in the midwest when he thinks 
about when he thinks about Islam,

4012
02:54:53,231 --> 02:54:55,990
he's thinking about isis or al Qaeda or 
all that sort of stuff.

4013
02:54:56,230 --> 02:55:00,490
He doesn't understand that those people 
don't represent the majority of Muslims.

4014
02:55:00,720 --> 02:55:03,890
And in the same way in this right.

4015
02:55:04,280 --> 02:55:05,113
Dorkins and Harris were being used to 
represent science in general and to 

4016
02:55:08,961 --> 02:55:11,630
represent evolution in general.
Right?

4017
02:55:11,631 --> 02:55:15,200
So they are essentially for a lot of 
people forming the stereotype of science

4018
02:55:15,490 --> 02:55:17,840
now,
now in opposition to them.

4019
02:55:17,841 --> 02:55:21,430
I mean with an opposition to Dawkins and
Harris.

4020
02:55:21,950 --> 02:55:24,830
And there were certain things they did 
in their teaching like they would do,

4021
02:55:25,010 --> 02:55:26,290
um,
you know,

4022
02:55:26,291 --> 02:55:26,760
the,
uh,

4023
02:55:26,760 --> 02:55:27,591
you know,
the school,

4024
02:55:27,591 --> 02:55:28,424
I mean,
it was a weird experience because one 

4025
02:55:29,570 --> 02:55:30,403
school had the very best rhetoric 
department that I've ever seen of any 

4026
02:55:33,561 --> 02:55:34,394
school because they knew that they were 
going to have people attacking their 

4027
02:55:36,531 --> 02:55:37,364
beliefs for their whole life.
And so you had to know all the logical 

4028
02:55:39,201 --> 02:55:41,110
fallacies Straw man,
you know,

4029
02:55:41,270 --> 02:55:43,820
to quote quail,
that's where stuff and the worst science

4030
02:55:43,821 --> 02:55:46,720
department for fuck you seen in my life.
Yeah.

4031
02:55:46,940 --> 02:55:48,560
Wonder why?
Well exactly.

4032
02:55:48,680 --> 02:55:49,780
And so,
you know,

4033
02:55:49,790 --> 02:55:50,990
they did all sorts of things.

4034
02:55:50,990 --> 02:55:53,510
Like for example,
they had a whole unit on Isms,

4035
02:55:53,720 --> 02:55:56,390
right?
They were like Nazis and fascism,

4036
02:55:56,391 --> 02:55:57,224
communism and how bad isms were.
And then right after that they taught 

4037
02:56:01,280 --> 02:56:03,950
the controversy around evolution.
So they were like,

4038
02:56:03,951 --> 02:56:06,080
well,
there are four different theories of the

4039
02:56:06,081 --> 02:56:07,640
origins of life,
right?

4040
02:56:07,880 --> 02:56:10,880
One is young Earth creationism,
one is intelligent design,

4041
02:56:11,090 --> 02:56:11,923
one is earth is metaphorical day.
And then the fourth one is a evolution 

4042
02:56:16,581 --> 02:56:20,240
isn't right.
She's just so evolutionism,

4043
02:56:20,480 --> 02:56:23,180
right?
So after telling you the evils of Isms,

4044
02:56:23,210 --> 02:56:24,210
that's right.
So,

4045
02:56:24,211 --> 02:56:26,360
so you're going on a long circuitous 
route here.

4046
02:56:26,361 --> 02:56:29,060
So because causation is about Harris so 
well,

4047
02:56:29,061 --> 02:56:29,894
but the problem is wrong with his views 
on God and what's wrong with his views 

4048
02:56:32,541 --> 02:56:33,560
on religion.
Well,

4049
02:56:33,561 --> 02:56:36,620
that's the point is,
is that religion is a set of beliefs.

4050
02:56:36,621 --> 02:56:39,680
And actually many of these beliefs are 
adapted to their environment even though

4051
02:56:39,681 --> 02:56:40,514
they seem cookie and they're also 
ideologies that are strictly enforced 

4052
02:56:43,041 --> 02:56:45,350
and that's one of the things he has a 
big issue with.

4053
02:56:45,380 --> 02:56:48,200
But the point is is that is the issue if
you want to.

4054
02:56:48,230 --> 02:56:51,860
So this comes down to how do you change 
people's minds and what does the science

4055
02:56:51,861 --> 02:56:54,950
say about how you change people's minds 
and how do you move ideas?

4056
02:56:55,010 --> 02:56:55,843
Okay.
So you're saying that his mocking of 

4057
02:56:57,921 --> 02:57:01,190
these ideas is contrary to the expanding
of knowledge.

4058
02:57:01,310 --> 02:57:03,640
It's a people are going to resist it and
it's,

4059
02:57:03,670 --> 02:57:04,503
it doesn't predict,
promote a productive exchange of ideas 

4060
02:57:06,471 --> 02:57:08,420
between tribes.
That's isn't that debate about.

4061
02:57:08,421 --> 02:57:09,254
Because a lot of people in listening to 
really excellent constructed arguments 

4062
02:57:12,801 --> 02:57:16,280
against religion will change their mind 
well like everything,

4063
02:57:16,310 --> 02:57:17,320
right?
So you know,

4064
02:57:17,360 --> 02:57:18,800
rule 34,
right?

4065
02:57:18,850 --> 02:57:20,630
Right.
So rule 34,

4066
02:57:20,631 --> 02:57:22,640
if you can imagine it,
there is porn of it,

4067
02:57:23,030 --> 02:57:24,920
right?
So in the same way,

4068
02:57:24,921 --> 02:57:26,810
if you can imagine it,
there is science of it,

4069
02:57:27,320 --> 02:57:28,153
right?
Right.

4070
02:57:28,190 --> 02:57:31,730
But hold on.
So there's actually science on how ideas

4071
02:57:31,731 --> 02:57:32,564
move.

4072
02:57:32,720 --> 02:57:33,553
There's a whole field of it and there's 
this book called the diffusion of 

4073
02:57:36,651 --> 02:57:37,760
innovations,
right?

4074
02:57:37,761 --> 02:57:38,594
And I had,
because I was working with these 

4075
02:57:39,531 --> 02:57:40,390
students,
right?

4076
02:57:40,760 --> 02:57:44,600
I was trying to figure out how do we get
these ideas to move and so I was like,

4077
02:57:44,630 --> 02:57:48,050
oh thank God there's a book all about 
how ideas move.

4078
02:57:48,170 --> 02:57:49,003
Right?
And what you come to find out is that 

4079
02:57:51,200 --> 02:57:52,033
all of the research shows,
there's a whole bunch of things that 

4080
02:57:54,261 --> 02:57:55,094
make ideas move.
One thing is they have to be compatible 

4081
02:57:57,621 --> 02:58:02,130
with people's existing beliefs and then 
also they have to be practical

4082
02:58:02,430 --> 02:58:05,220
so they have to confer some sort of 
practical benefit.

4083
02:58:05,610 --> 02:58:09,840
Right?
So if in terms of moving evolution,

4084
02:58:10,170 --> 02:58:12,600
the first thing is to recognize that,
you know,

4085
02:58:12,601 --> 02:58:15,750
if we really want to like not just spend
another hundred and 50 years,

4086
02:58:15,990 --> 02:58:16,823
you know,
having a fight between science and 

4087
02:58:17,941 --> 02:58:18,774
religion and all that sort of stuff.
The first thing to realize is that what 

4088
02:58:21,031 --> 02:58:21,864
people like David Sloan Wilson are 
saying is fundamentally compatible with 

4089
02:58:24,721 --> 02:58:26,220
Christianity,
right?

4090
02:58:26,221 --> 02:58:28,530
Because they understand that,
you know,

4091
02:58:28,590 --> 02:58:30,570
that altruism matters,
right?

4092
02:58:30,571 --> 02:58:31,860
All this sort of stuff,
right.

4093
02:58:32,440 --> 02:58:37,230
The sort of doc doc type notion of it's 
all about selfishness and everybody just

4094
02:58:37,231 --> 02:58:39,120
trying to fuck everybody and all that 
sort of stuff.

4095
02:58:39,420 --> 02:58:42,090
Part of it is that doesn't fit well with
Christianity,

4096
02:58:42,420 --> 02:58:43,253
right?
It doesn't fit well with religious 

4097
02:58:44,191 --> 02:58:45,180
notions.
Right?

4098
02:58:45,570 --> 02:58:48,210
Secondly,
all of this stuff that I'm talking about

4099
02:58:48,211 --> 02:58:51,120
with cultural evolution is deeply 
practical,

4100
02:58:51,390 --> 02:58:51,690
right?

4101
02:58:51,690 --> 02:58:52,523
You can see that if we have a 
conversation as humanity about culture 

4102
02:58:56,431 --> 02:58:57,264
and how my choices are being driven and 
all that sort of stuff so that I can 

4103
02:59:00,031 --> 02:59:01,740
change my culture and all that sort of 
stuff,

4104
02:59:01,741 --> 02:59:02,574
that we can fix a whole lot of things.
That notion of culture relies on group 

4105
02:59:06,511 --> 02:59:07,890
selection,
right?

4106
02:59:07,891 --> 02:59:08,724
It relies on this multilevel selection 
idea that Dawkins is not on board with 

4107
02:59:12,301 --> 02:59:15,060
and all that sort of stuff and that Sam 
Harris is not on board with.

4108
02:59:16,050 --> 02:59:20,580
So ultimately what I want to do is I 
want to move these ideas,

4109
02:59:20,850 --> 02:59:22,260
but the whole point is,
Joe,

4110
02:59:22,350 --> 02:59:23,183
is that part of the reason why you 
brought me on this podcast today is 

4111
02:59:25,981 --> 02:59:28,050
specifically because I called out 
Richard.

4112
02:59:28,280 --> 02:59:29,010
No,
no,

4113
02:59:29,010 --> 02:59:29,520
no,
no,

4114
02:59:29,520 --> 02:59:30,353
no.
I brought you on because Brian Cowen 

4115
02:59:31,391 --> 02:59:33,360
recommends you and I listen to you on 
his podcast.

4116
02:59:33,580 --> 02:59:34,413
He had nothing to do with that.
I just thought that'd be an interesting 

4117
02:59:35,461 --> 02:59:36,480
topic of discussion.
Okay.

4118
02:59:36,930 --> 02:59:37,763
But I still don't understand.
So you're saying that essentially Sam 

4119
02:59:42,420 --> 02:59:43,253
Harris's refused one or refuting rather 
of religion and his ideas about 

4120
02:59:49,411 --> 02:59:50,244
spreading what he believes are the 
empirical truths about science are in 

4121
02:59:55,411 --> 02:59:56,244
somehow or another causing a resistance 
to these very ideas because of the way 

4122
03:00:00,871 --> 03:00:01,704
he's presenting them because he's not 
presenting them in a form that 

4123
03:00:04,661 --> 03:00:06,980
psychologically digestible.
Is that what you're saying?

4124
03:00:06,990 --> 03:00:07,350
Yes,

4125
03:00:07,350 --> 03:00:08,183
and also fundamentally he creates the 
stereotype of scientists that is being 

4126
03:00:11,581 --> 03:00:12,414
formed around him.
And what is that well is that they're 

4127
03:00:15,271 --> 03:00:16,500
angry,
aggressive.

4128
03:00:16,790 --> 03:00:18,260
They doesn't seem aggressive.
Well,

4129
03:00:18,270 --> 03:00:19,260
he seems aggressive.
It's not.

4130
03:00:19,290 --> 03:00:20,123
It's not about really.
I mean that was the point of like 

4131
03:00:21,570 --> 03:00:22,403
spending time in at oaks Christian.
It's not really about how I was 

4132
03:00:25,021 --> 03:00:26,740
perceiving them because I wasn't 
thinking about it.

4133
03:00:27,110 --> 03:00:27,943
Well,
these are people that are pushing a 

4134
03:00:29,571 --> 03:00:34,571
ridiculous ideology and the enemies of 
that ridiculous ideology they attack.

4135
03:00:36,050 --> 03:00:37,700
They're attacking,
but the basic,

4136
03:00:38,190 --> 03:00:39,950
the basic problem is attacking.
Right?

4137
03:00:39,951 --> 03:00:44,750
But it's a very small segment of mean 
schools that are doing this.

4138
03:00:44,751 --> 03:00:45,584
Right.
You're talking about how many people 

4139
03:00:46,251 --> 03:00:48,860
believe Christian school,
how many people believe in evolution?

4140
03:00:49,090 --> 03:00:51,100
It was probably a giant number.
Well,

4141
03:00:51,110 --> 03:00:51,943
I mean,
you know,

4142
03:00:52,280 --> 03:00:54,800
you can look at different polls,
but it's like 50 slash 50.

4143
03:00:54,890 --> 03:00:55,723
Yeah,
I think it's like 46 percent according 

4144
03:00:57,291 --> 03:00:59,590
to a recent Gallup poll,
but my joke was always like,

4145
03:00:59,860 --> 03:01:00,010
who

4146
03:01:00,010 --> 03:01:01,700
the fuck answer is?
Paul's mean,

4147
03:01:01,720 --> 03:01:05,110
is it like one out of 100 at triggered 
last night?

4148
03:01:05,230 --> 03:01:05,650
Right?
Yeah.

4149
03:01:05,650 --> 03:01:07,440
The people dumb enough to answer polls 
sets,

4150
03:01:07,441 --> 03:01:08,274
right?
One percent,

4151
03:01:08,740 --> 03:01:11,140
but,
but ultimately that's the,

4152
03:01:11,230 --> 03:01:12,280
the,
you know,

4153
03:01:12,340 --> 03:01:13,173
the sort of,
the larger thing that I would like to 

4154
03:01:14,801 --> 03:01:18,520
achieve is a scientific reformation,
right?

4155
03:01:18,610 --> 03:01:21,040
So you know,
you the,

4156
03:01:21,060 --> 03:01:23,050
you know,
Martin Luther triggers this,

4157
03:01:23,160 --> 03:01:26,140
this reformation with the Catholic 
church and all that sort of stuff.

4158
03:01:27,100 --> 03:01:27,933
At the cornerstone of the core of the 
Catholic Church was this idea of love 

4159
03:01:29,951 --> 03:01:30,784
they neighbor as thyself.
And basically Martin Luther said the 

4160
03:01:32,651 --> 03:01:33,484
people in the power in this,
in the religious establishment are not 

4161
03:01:36,520 --> 03:01:40,490
living that principle right at the core 
of sciences.

4162
03:01:40,540 --> 03:01:42,670
This idea that we should be responsive 
to evidence,

4163
03:01:43,060 --> 03:01:43,893
right?
Right.

4164
03:01:44,050 --> 03:01:44,883
And the scientific establishment is 
often not living or the academic 

4165
03:01:47,351 --> 03:01:49,210
establishment is not living that,
that,

4166
03:01:49,390 --> 03:01:50,470
that,
you know,

4167
03:01:50,620 --> 03:01:51,453
principal.

4168
03:01:51,580 --> 03:01:52,690
Right.
So,

4169
03:01:52,750 --> 03:01:55,960
and part of the problem is,
is that left to their own devices,

4170
03:01:56,200 --> 03:01:57,033
they will continue to remain in their 
tiny lanes and a lot of these academic 

4171
03:01:59,741 --> 03:02:02,770
disputes can only be solved by going 
outside their lanes.

4172
03:02:03,040 --> 03:02:05,980
So for example,
if Sam Harris was here,

4173
03:02:06,040 --> 03:02:06,873
right?
And I've said this on the podcast with 

4174
03:02:08,021 --> 03:02:08,854
Brian,
the one thing that I wanted would want 

4175
03:02:10,361 --> 03:02:12,100
to talk about,
the only thing that I would want to talk

4176
03:02:12,101 --> 03:02:16,000
about is this rationalist versus 
intuitionist idea and try and reach some

4177
03:02:16,001 --> 03:02:16,834
sort of definitive conclusion on that 
because if Sam Harris is thinking and 

4178
03:02:20,051 --> 03:02:20,884
feeling are always being linked,
then he has to decide how his feelings 

4179
03:02:24,551 --> 03:02:25,384
about religion are driving his thinking 
and whether his feelings about religion 

4180
03:02:28,661 --> 03:02:32,740
are appropriate in light of the evidence
or whether they're not appropriate.

4181
03:02:33,040 --> 03:02:34,090
So that makes sense.
Well,

4182
03:02:34,091 --> 03:02:36,760
religion as itself though,
when you talk to you about evidence,

4183
03:02:36,761 --> 03:02:39,310
it's extremely lacking in that.

4184
03:02:39,310 --> 03:02:40,143
So what he's talking about is people 
that are subscribing to a very rigid 

4185
03:02:43,391 --> 03:02:44,224
ideology that he thinks is compromising 
growth in the same way that racism 

4186
03:02:48,491 --> 03:02:51,490
justifies the behavior of social justice
warriors.

4187
03:02:51,730 --> 03:02:52,750
So it's not,
I'm not.

4188
03:02:52,870 --> 03:02:54,820
So you know,
you understand,

4189
03:02:54,850 --> 03:02:55,683
I understood this but,
but this religious discrimination is 

4190
03:02:57,491 --> 03:03:02,380
based on an ideology,
of course that's written on animal skins

4191
03:03:02,381 --> 03:03:05,200
from thousands of years ago.
Actually my ignorance.

4192
03:03:05,380 --> 03:03:08,600
So there's much more to that than,
than just saying that it's,

4193
03:03:08,601 --> 03:03:12,490
it's similar to racism will know.
But what I'm saying is that,

4194
03:03:12,520 --> 03:03:14,470
you know,
in this is again,

4195
03:03:14,471 --> 03:03:16,960
so there's a,
there's a larger principle here,

4196
03:03:17,770 --> 03:03:18,940
and again,
you can find it in,

4197
03:03:19,080 --> 03:03:20,350
you know,
Jon Heights' book,

4198
03:03:20,351 --> 03:03:21,700
the happiness hypothesis,
right?

4199
03:03:21,701 --> 03:03:22,534
Which is,
this is something that Jesus talked 

4200
03:03:23,291 --> 03:03:24,670
about a long time ago,
right?

4201
03:03:24,940 --> 03:03:28,510
Which is that it's easy to see the 
splinter in my brother's eye,

4202
03:03:28,511 --> 03:03:31,270
but hard to see the log in my own.
So in general,

4203
03:03:31,271 --> 03:03:32,980
when you talk to people,
right?

4204
03:03:32,981 --> 03:03:34,670
Like if you look at Jordan Peterson,
right?

4205
03:03:34,990 --> 03:03:37,900
Jordan Peterson criticizes people on 
College Campuses,

4206
03:03:37,930 --> 03:03:39,910
right?
And He,

4207
03:03:40,000 --> 03:03:41,440
you know,
for us,

4208
03:03:41,441 --> 03:03:42,580
right?
He comes on my show,

4209
03:03:42,581 --> 03:03:44,800
he comes on your show and we all cheer 
him on.

4210
03:03:44,801 --> 03:03:46,180
We're like,
that's so fucking great.

4211
03:03:46,360 --> 03:03:47,193
Right?
What is the reaction that Jordan 

4212
03:03:48,730 --> 03:03:51,720
Peterson gets on his campus?
Mixed.

4213
03:03:51,900 --> 03:03:54,490
It's very mixed.
Some were saluting him,

4214
03:03:54,580 --> 03:03:56,620
some people were very upset at him.
That's right.

4215
03:03:56,870 --> 03:03:58,310
And so for example,

4216
03:03:58,310 --> 03:04:00,170
when I took,
when I challenged these,

4217
03:04:00,171 --> 03:04:01,400
you know,
the narco capitalists,

4218
03:04:01,401 --> 03:04:02,990
the libertarians,
all that sort of stuff,

4219
03:04:03,200 --> 03:04:04,033
I got some people cheering me on and 
then a lot of people calling me 

4220
03:04:06,380 --> 03:04:09,020
intellectually dishonest or whatever and
all that sort of stuff,

4221
03:04:09,050 --> 03:04:11,120
right?
These arguments,

4222
03:04:11,121 --> 03:04:14,150
nobody is saying that these arguments as
they currently stand are easy.

4223
03:04:14,151 --> 03:04:16,160
There's a lot of material to draw,
right?

4224
03:04:16,520 --> 03:04:17,480
And,
you know,

4225
03:04:17,890 --> 03:04:19,320
um,
my in,

4226
03:04:19,321 --> 03:04:20,154
in the end,
like my job is to communicate them as 

4227
03:04:21,831 --> 03:04:25,270
clearly as possible.
What I'm saying is,

4228
03:04:25,271 --> 03:04:29,210
is that if you want to move science,
like science has a communication problem

4229
03:04:29,510 --> 03:04:30,343
right now.
If you read people in science like a 

4230
03:04:32,781 --> 03:04:34,940
tool Guan Day,
he'll just be like,

4231
03:04:35,240 --> 03:04:37,910
people are fucking dumb.
Science is complicated,

4232
03:04:37,911 --> 03:04:38,510
right?
You,

4233
03:04:38,510 --> 03:04:39,343
you going,
you go on these big broad journeys for 

4234
03:04:41,840 --> 03:04:42,890
you come back.
So,

4235
03:04:42,891 --> 03:04:43,724
so,
so what I'm saying is that Sam Harris 

4236
03:04:46,251 --> 03:04:51,251
and Richard Dawkins are the kind of 
friends with friends like Sam Harris and

4237
03:04:51,441 --> 03:04:52,220
Richard Dawkins.

4238
03:04:52,220 --> 03:04:55,790
Science doesn't need enemies.
They are alienating,

4239
03:04:55,820 --> 03:04:56,653
they are not helping us and they're 
getting in the way of communicating 

4240
03:04:58,881 --> 03:04:59,714
science.
I understand because of the very 

4241
03:05:01,370 --> 03:05:02,203
approach that they're taking.
If science was to adopt the approach of 

4242
03:05:06,081 --> 03:05:08,600
we are here in light of the diffusion of
innovations,

4243
03:05:08,601 --> 03:05:09,434
which is the book all about how you feel
the same way about Neil degrasse Tyson 

4244
03:05:11,301 --> 03:05:12,134
and is open criticism of religion.
Well I think in general that I don't 

4245
03:05:15,201 --> 03:05:18,140
think that the criticism of religion is 
helping science.

4246
03:05:18,141 --> 03:05:18,974
It's a hundred and 50 year old science 
has been at war with religion for a 

4247
03:05:21,751 --> 03:05:22,584
hundred and 50 years.
So you don't think that science should 

4248
03:05:24,140 --> 03:05:26,530
be honest or the.
I think that will.

4249
03:05:26,540 --> 03:05:28,840
That scientists should be honest about 
their own personal.

4250
03:05:29,200 --> 03:05:30,033
Well,
but the point is is that I believe that 

4251
03:05:30,891 --> 03:05:31,724
scientists should read science widely 
and if you look at someone like John 

4252
03:05:34,400 --> 03:05:35,233
Height,
part of the reason why John Height and 

4253
03:05:36,201 --> 03:05:37,034
Sam Harris have fought is because John 
doesn't have a problem with religion 

4254
03:05:40,100 --> 03:05:42,350
because when you update your view of the
brain,

4255
03:05:42,560 --> 03:05:43,393
you come to realize that what's really 
going on is that you blindly 

4256
03:05:46,551 --> 03:05:47,384
internalized the beliefs of science and 
your community and all that sort of 

4257
03:05:50,061 --> 03:05:50,894
stuff and that they blindly internalized
the beliefs of their community and that 

4258
03:05:54,501 --> 03:05:58,400
if you want to move ideas,
if you want to move scientific ideas,

4259
03:05:58,640 --> 03:05:59,473
what we have to do is establish trust,
but what specifically are they blindly 

4260
03:06:02,571 --> 03:06:03,404
interpreting,
but it's this idea of that reason and 

4261
03:06:05,841 --> 03:06:07,710
emotion are separate,
but what?

4262
03:06:07,760 --> 03:06:12,440
How does that apply strictly to religion
and beliefs on religion being incorrect?

4263
03:06:12,441 --> 03:06:14,750
Because if you look at the behavior of 
fundamentalists,

4264
03:06:14,751 --> 03:06:17,000
right?
They get very into the,

4265
03:06:17,060 --> 03:06:20,120
the literal text in the wording and all 
that sort of stuff.

4266
03:06:20,150 --> 03:06:20,983
Right?
And it's the same thing with Sam Harris 

4267
03:06:22,791 --> 03:06:23,870
and Richard Dawkins,
right?

4268
03:06:23,871 --> 03:06:27,920
They're super into like breaking apart.
What does the Koran say?

4269
03:06:28,070 --> 03:06:30,200
What does the Bible say and all this 
sort of stuff,

4270
03:06:30,440 --> 03:06:34,550
and what really matters is what is the 
spirit in which it's being approached.

4271
03:06:34,551 --> 03:06:36,080
What are,
how do you feel about these things?

4272
03:06:36,081 --> 03:06:38,810
So if you look at something like gay 
marriage,

4273
03:06:38,840 --> 03:06:40,070
right,
or homosexuals,

4274
03:06:40,100 --> 03:06:40,933
right?
What does the Bible say on 

4275
03:06:41,721 --> 03:06:44,060
homosexuality?
Well,

4276
03:06:44,120 --> 03:06:46,820
it says two totally different things,
right?

4277
03:06:46,930 --> 03:06:49,400
There's what it says about Sodom and 
Gomorrah.

4278
03:06:49,730 --> 03:06:52,310
And then there's what it says about,
uh,

4279
03:06:52,311 --> 03:06:53,720
you know,
love thy neighbor as thyself.

4280
03:06:53,860 --> 03:06:55,500
And if you hate gays,
you're to be like,

4281
03:06:55,560 --> 03:06:56,970
oh,
Sodom and Gomorrah.

4282
03:06:56,971 --> 03:06:58,170
That's the thing.
Right?

4283
03:06:58,380 --> 03:06:59,213
And if you like gay people,
you have a nice gay neighbor or 

4284
03:07:00,961 --> 03:07:01,740
whatever.
You're like,

4285
03:07:01,740 --> 03:07:03,150
Oh,
love thy neighbor as thyself.

4286
03:07:03,240 --> 03:07:05,760
Right?
So the issue is not the text,

4287
03:07:06,000 --> 03:07:08,580
the issue is what does the person feel 
about the thing,

4288
03:07:09,030 --> 03:07:09,863
right?
That's,

4289
03:07:09,870 --> 03:07:11,880
that's the psychology that is driving 
it.

4290
03:07:12,080 --> 03:07:14,040
Right?
So the point is,

4291
03:07:14,041 --> 03:07:16,230
is that if you want to fix the problem,
right,

4292
03:07:16,560 --> 03:07:19,290
you don't worry about the text,
right?

4293
03:07:19,291 --> 03:07:21,240
You don't worry about what are the 
literal.

4294
03:07:21,350 --> 03:07:23,990
The text is preposterous.
It should be discussed.

4295
03:07:24,290 --> 03:07:25,123
Well,
I mean if the taxed promotes violence 

4296
03:07:28,131 --> 03:07:28,964
against women or against any particular 
group that doesn't believe what you 

4297
03:07:32,901 --> 03:07:35,990
believe it's discussed because it's 
problematic,

4298
03:07:36,080 --> 03:07:36,810
right?

4299
03:07:36,810 --> 03:07:40,710
Different people like has the Bible 
changed in the last 400 years?

4300
03:07:41,180 --> 03:07:42,013
No,
but different people's interpretations 

4301
03:07:42,921 --> 03:07:44,510
of the bibles have.
Right?

4302
03:07:44,690 --> 03:07:45,523
Right.
And so,

4303
03:07:45,610 --> 03:07:47,020
so for example,
you know,

4304
03:07:47,021 --> 03:07:48,520
if you look at,
if you look at,

4305
03:07:48,521 --> 03:07:49,354
for example,
where are Muslims now and where are 

4306
03:07:50,771 --> 03:07:53,760
Christians now look at Christianity and 
the 1600.

4307
03:07:54,160 --> 03:07:58,270
Well this is an issue that Michael 
Shermer wrote about recently about Islam

4308
03:07:58,271 --> 03:08:02,410
not experiencing the enlightenment that 
other religions have gone through this.

4309
03:08:02,490 --> 03:08:03,323
Well,
it's specifically about Islam 

4310
03:08:05,101 --> 03:08:06,940
experiencing a D enlightenment,
right?

4311
03:08:06,960 --> 03:08:08,580
Because in the year $1,000
they were.

4312
03:08:09,120 --> 03:08:11,640
But so the real thing that if you want 
to fix Islam,

4313
03:08:11,641 --> 03:08:12,970
and again,
like you know,

4314
03:08:12,990 --> 03:08:15,840
I was born in Saudi Arabia,
my parents live in Dubai.

4315
03:08:16,110 --> 03:08:18,810
Like there are conversations happening 
about this.

4316
03:08:19,020 --> 03:08:19,853
What you have to do is,
is that you have to change the 

4317
03:08:21,841 --> 03:08:23,760
intellectual climate,
but the.

4318
03:08:23,820 --> 03:08:27,480
But the intellectual climate has nothing
to do with the text.

4319
03:08:27,510 --> 03:08:30,720
It has to do with a lot of what people 
believe about learning what they believe

4320
03:08:30,721 --> 03:08:31,554
about themselves,
whether they find ideas threatening and 

4321
03:08:34,010 --> 03:08:37,890
the the text that when Islam in the year
1000,

4322
03:08:38,220 --> 03:08:39,053
right was the most intellectually 
advanced place on the planet and the 

4323
03:08:42,271 --> 03:08:45,900
text that Islam is using now has not 
changed.

4324
03:08:46,200 --> 03:08:47,033
So what happens is,
is that people like Sam Harris and 

4325
03:08:49,141 --> 03:08:51,870
Richard Dawkins,
they get super caught up in the text,

4326
03:08:52,050 --> 03:08:53,640
but really if you want to fix these 
problems,

4327
03:08:53,641 --> 03:08:54,750
you have to talk about,
you know,

4328
03:08:54,751 --> 03:08:57,600
what are your beliefs about your 
intentional intelligence,

4329
03:08:57,690 --> 03:08:59,520
how do you feel about other cultures?

4330
03:08:59,670 --> 03:09:00,503
You have to talk about feelings and 
that's really where the conversation 

4331
03:09:03,091 --> 03:09:03,924
changes and the point is,
is that rationalist don't talk about 

4332
03:09:06,511 --> 03:09:08,700
feelings.
So that's the real.

4333
03:09:08,730 --> 03:09:09,563
I mean that is the core of what needs to
happen and the science is there to do 

4334
03:09:13,111 --> 03:09:14,410
that.
But the point is,

4335
03:09:14,411 --> 03:09:15,090
is that,
you know,

4336
03:09:15,090 --> 03:09:15,923
let's put these people side by side.
John Height has a following of 

4337
03:09:18,600 --> 03:09:20,130
essentially zero,
right?

4338
03:09:20,460 --> 03:09:22,800
Richard Dawkins has a huge following,
right?

4339
03:09:22,801 --> 03:09:25,950
Sam Harris has a big following.
Someone like Joe Henrich,

4340
03:09:26,070 --> 03:09:28,230
I'd probably maybe has three twitter 
followers.

4341
03:09:28,470 --> 03:09:30,870
So the people who are representing 
science,

4342
03:09:30,871 --> 03:09:32,190
right?
Neil degrasse Tyson,

4343
03:09:32,520 --> 03:09:33,353
you know,
no one's questioning like does Neil 

4344
03:09:34,561 --> 03:09:35,394
degrasse tyson?
No way the fuck more about astrophysics 

4345
03:09:37,291 --> 03:09:38,124
than I do 100 percent,
but I don't know that Neil degrasse 

4346
03:09:41,910 --> 03:09:43,020
Tyson has,
for example,

4347
03:09:43,021 --> 03:09:43,854
read the diffusion of innovations 
because I will tell you that I've had 

4348
03:09:46,080 --> 03:09:48,960
numerous academics on the podcast.

4349
03:09:48,960 --> 03:09:50,400
For example,
David Sloan Wilson,

4350
03:09:50,670 --> 03:09:52,200
David Sloan Wilson,
right?

4351
03:09:52,230 --> 03:09:53,530
I asked him,
you know,

4352
03:09:53,531 --> 03:09:58,531
he sent me this thing back in 2014 and 
it was a 67 page paper and it said,

4353
03:10:00,040 --> 03:10:00,873
you know,
it was towards a science of intentional 

4354
03:10:02,381 --> 03:10:03,214
behavior change or something like that.
And I read the 67 pages and at the end 

4355
03:10:06,551 --> 03:10:07,384
of the 16,
17,

4356
03:10:07,430 --> 03:10:08,710
67 pages,
I'm like,

4357
03:10:08,740 --> 03:10:09,573
I feel like what you're actually talking
about is how do you move ideas and 

4358
03:10:12,250 --> 03:10:16,060
wasn't that already solved with the 
diffusion of innovations?

4359
03:10:16,570 --> 03:10:18,250
And he said,
Oh,

4360
03:10:18,251 --> 03:10:19,120
I,
you know,

4361
03:10:19,121 --> 03:10:21,550
I've obviously heard of the diffusion of
innovations.

4362
03:10:21,551 --> 03:10:23,950
Like Everett Rogers is literally famous 
work,

4363
03:10:24,160 --> 03:10:24,993
but I've never made a close study of it.
Now the diffusion of innovations was 

4364
03:10:28,961 --> 03:10:33,370
written in 1967.
It is an innovation that hasn't diffused

4365
03:10:33,460 --> 03:10:37,510
and that's specifically because even 
though it's set practices,

4366
03:10:37,560 --> 03:10:39,850
it preaches one thing about how ideas 
move.

4367
03:10:40,000 --> 03:10:42,880
It's written in that dry scientific 
technical style.

4368
03:10:43,240 --> 03:10:45,630
So a guy like Neil degrasse Tyson,
you know,

4369
03:10:45,760 --> 03:10:49,070
or Sam Harris or Richard Dawkins or 
David Sloan Wilson,

4370
03:10:49,071 --> 03:10:51,100
the war,
John Hyde or Joe Henrich or any of these

4371
03:10:51,101 --> 03:10:51,934
guys often have not heard of ideas that 
are relevant to the conversations that 

4372
03:10:57,521 --> 03:11:00,370
we're having.
Like it's not just that the ideas aren't

4373
03:11:00,371 --> 03:11:01,210
moving between them

4374
03:11:01,220 --> 03:11:03,200
sciences,
some bizarre conversation to have if you

4375
03:11:03,201 --> 03:11:04,640
don't know whether or not they've read 
that

4376
03:11:04,940 --> 03:11:05,773
well,
but you can look at people's behavior 

4377
03:11:07,910 --> 03:11:08,743
and you can see from people's behavior 
whether they understand certain things 

4378
03:11:11,241 --> 03:11:11,590
or not,

4379
03:11:11,590 --> 03:11:13,300
whether they agree with certain things.
I mean,

4380
03:11:13,301 --> 03:11:16,400
just because their behavior doesn't,
isn't compatible to that paper.

4381
03:11:16,401 --> 03:11:17,234
It doesn't mean that they haven't read 
it and just decided that they don't 

4382
03:11:19,451 --> 03:11:21,130
agree or they have another point of 
view.

4383
03:11:21,340 --> 03:11:22,500
Well,
I mean the,

4384
03:11:22,540 --> 03:11:23,480
for a,
you know,

4385
03:11:23,570 --> 03:11:25,050
uh,
okay.

4386
03:11:25,110 --> 03:11:26,080
Uh,
if you immune,

4387
03:11:26,110 --> 03:11:28,310
if we're going to really get into this,
we really

4388
03:11:28,360 --> 03:11:29,390
camp,
we were,

4389
03:11:29,391 --> 03:11:30,550
we're,
we're way over,

4390
03:11:30,610 --> 03:11:31,443
we're like 25 minutes over.
So I was trying to figure out a way to 

4391
03:11:33,760 --> 03:11:35,650
skirt out of here quick,
but yeah,

4392
03:11:36,030 --> 03:11:37,350
but I mean the,
the,

4393
03:11:37,700 --> 03:11:41,580
the point that I'm trying to the large,
I think the main point is this,

4394
03:11:41,581 --> 03:11:42,620
that,
you know,

4395
03:11:42,780 --> 03:11:45,180
from all of our conversations about 
culture,

4396
03:11:45,510 --> 03:11:46,343
right,
there are ideas out there trapped in 

4397
03:11:48,481 --> 03:11:49,314
books,
which is the whole point of what we're 

4398
03:11:50,431 --> 03:11:51,264
doing on the brand calvin show that have
real practical value to improving 

4399
03:11:55,321 --> 03:11:56,154
people's lives.
Those ideas are not moving and part of 

4400
03:11:59,911 --> 03:11:59,990
it,

4401
03:11:59,990 --> 03:12:01,700
don't you think they're all kind of 
moving?

4402
03:12:02,210 --> 03:12:04,550
Well right now,
everything is moving

4403
03:12:04,680 --> 03:12:05,310
well,
but.

4404
03:12:05,310 --> 03:12:07,860
Well,
so part of the diffusion of innovations,

4405
03:12:07,861 --> 03:12:08,694
right?
So the book opens with a story about 

4406
03:12:11,461 --> 03:12:12,660
scurvy,
right?

4407
03:12:12,720 --> 03:12:14,610
So scurvy is,
you know,

4408
03:12:14,611 --> 03:12:16,710
this problem that killed 2 million 
people,

4409
03:12:16,800 --> 03:12:17,820
right?
And you know,

4410
03:12:17,821 --> 03:12:18,654
it's all comes down to vitamin C 
deficiency and it's the simplest 

4411
03:12:20,671 --> 03:12:22,590
solution in the world.
You just suck on a line.

4412
03:12:23,040 --> 03:12:23,873
So between scurvy being figured out,
right in a sort of academic context and 

4413
03:12:28,311 --> 03:12:33,311
between it being applied 150 years past 
150 years.

4414
03:12:35,040 --> 03:12:37,380
So the point is is that ideas don't 
move.

4415
03:12:37,381 --> 03:12:40,020
Well they didn't have the internet,
but it's not even about that.

4416
03:12:40,021 --> 03:12:40,420
It's good.

4417
03:12:40,420 --> 03:12:41,253
It isn't it.
I mean isn't that the best way to 

4418
03:12:42,101 --> 03:12:42,934
distribute information as the internet?
The fact that it took 150 years for 

4419
03:12:46,361 --> 03:12:49,870
scurvy to be cured,
even though the information was there,

4420
03:12:50,020 --> 03:12:53,690
don't you think that directly coincides 
with the lack of ability to express that

4421
03:12:53,691 --> 03:12:54,524
information?

4422
03:12:54,670 --> 03:12:56,800
It has to do with.
And that's the point of the diffusion of

4423
03:12:56,801 --> 03:12:57,634
innovations.
It's has to do with the ideas being 

4424
03:12:58,811 --> 03:12:59,644
packaged in a way that is culturally and
psychologically compatible with what 

4425
03:13:04,211 --> 03:13:07,510
people already believe and it being 
shown that they have practical value.

4426
03:13:07,750 --> 03:13:11,010
The basic barrier is this.
Why have ideas?

4427
03:13:11,050 --> 03:13:11,920
Have these,
you know,

4428
03:13:11,921 --> 03:13:12,670
the,
the,

4429
03:13:12,670 --> 03:13:16,250
the science of evolution has been around
for hundred and 50 years.

4430
03:13:16,320 --> 03:13:18,280
That vitamin C example that you're 
using,

4431
03:13:18,281 --> 03:13:19,114
you're talking about an extremely 
limited amount of education available 

4432
03:13:21,491 --> 03:13:24,010
when people were not expressing them.

4433
03:13:24,420 --> 03:13:25,021
Well,
what?

4434
03:13:25,021 --> 03:13:30,021
Eighteen 47 in comparison to 2016 or 17 
difference.

4435
03:13:30,690 --> 03:13:31,523
Yeah,
but if you've got 2 million people 

4436
03:13:32,341 --> 03:13:33,900
dying,
right?

4437
03:13:33,990 --> 03:13:36,180
There were 2 million people dying.
It was a huge problem.

4438
03:13:36,181 --> 03:13:39,270
They didn't know how to solve it and 
these ideas didn't move.

4439
03:13:39,360 --> 03:13:41,670
Right.
But how can you compare that to today?

4440
03:13:41,970 --> 03:13:43,000
Well,
the,

4441
03:13:43,140 --> 03:13:44,290
I mean the,
the.

4442
03:13:44,820 --> 03:13:45,480
I mean,
you know,

4443
03:13:45,480 --> 03:13:46,650
I mean Joe,
we can't do the,

4444
03:13:46,680 --> 03:13:49,470
we can't do the experiment where,
you know,

4445
03:13:49,471 --> 03:13:53,760
we have one world where we don't move,
we don't do anything to package and move

4446
03:13:53,761 --> 03:13:54,594
the ideas and we have another world 
where we do actively work to try and 

4447
03:13:57,541 --> 03:13:59,670
package and move these ideas.
We can't do that,

4448
03:13:59,790 --> 03:14:03,120
but it's 160 years difference in the 
world is a different world.

4449
03:14:03,180 --> 03:14:04,440
Well,
the technology is different,

4450
03:14:04,441 --> 03:14:05,274
but the human mind hasn't changed.
The human mind hasn't changed really in 

4451
03:14:07,561 --> 03:14:08,640
10,000
years.

4452
03:14:09,600 --> 03:14:11,790
The human mind might not have changed 
genetically,

4453
03:14:11,791 --> 03:14:14,040
but it's understanding of the world has 
changed radically.

4454
03:14:14,041 --> 03:14:16,710
So it's understanding of what a vitamin 
is

4455
03:14:17,160 --> 03:14:17,993
well,
but that's the different between you 

4456
03:14:19,891 --> 03:14:20,724
understand well,
but that's also important is that it's 

4457
03:14:22,201 --> 03:14:25,350
important to realize that when this 
whole scurvy conversation was going on,

4458
03:14:25,380 --> 03:14:26,213
they didn't have the concept of a 
vitamin and there are three concepts 

4459
03:14:28,831 --> 03:14:29,664
that you don't have right now in terms 
of this idea that thinking and feeling 

4460
03:14:32,941 --> 03:14:33,960
are always linked,
right?

4461
03:14:33,961 --> 03:14:34,794
This idea of descartes' error,
that's not our culture doesn't talk 

4462
03:14:37,591 --> 03:14:39,810
about emotions in a way where they 
understand,

4463
03:14:40,050 --> 03:14:40,883
oh,
this behavior of the student where they 

4464
03:14:41,650 --> 03:14:43,230
bought up the test and they throw it all
away.

4465
03:14:43,231 --> 03:14:46,380
That is being driven by an emotion.
A lot of people understand that though,

4466
03:14:46,440 --> 03:14:47,210
do they?

4467
03:14:47,210 --> 03:14:48,043
For sure.
A lot of people understand that people 

4468
03:14:49,281 --> 03:14:52,580
get humiliated by failure and then it 
makes them pull back,

4469
03:14:52,630 --> 03:14:53,750
okay,
so they don't grow.

4470
03:14:53,751 --> 03:14:54,584
And when people teach people,
there's a lot of things that people 

4471
03:14:56,031 --> 03:14:56,864
teach about when learning new 
information to make an encouraging and 

4472
03:15:00,411 --> 03:15:05,360
to make it enjoyable and to express 
boundless potential and not express,

4473
03:15:05,630 --> 03:15:06,710
you know,
very clear,

4474
03:15:06,711 --> 03:15:07,544
rigid boundaries that you're never going
to cross and that you can impart these 

4475
03:15:10,791 --> 03:15:11,624
very limiting ideas into children's 
minds or you can expand upon their 

4476
03:15:14,931 --> 03:15:15,764
potential horizons by promoting this 
idea of accessibility and have have 

4477
03:15:19,700 --> 03:15:20,720
massive potential

4478
03:15:20,770 --> 03:15:23,720
of course.
But is it a standard practice in America

4479
03:15:23,721 --> 03:15:24,554
schools today when a student,
when a student gets a bad tests that we 

4480
03:15:28,361 --> 03:15:30,640
all work through those mistakes and 
analyze them.

4481
03:15:30,820 --> 03:15:32,780
I don't know what the standards.
It's not.

4482
03:15:33,200 --> 03:15:34,033
I mean that's just shitty teaching,
but it's not a matter of lack of 

4483
03:15:37,421 --> 03:15:38,254
understanding amongst certain 
individuals about the way people are 

4484
03:15:40,541 --> 03:15:41,980
motivated and not motivated.

4485
03:15:42,210 --> 03:15:43,043
Well,
there may be a small number of 

4486
03:15:43,561 --> 03:15:44,394
individuals,
but that doesn't mean that that is the 

4487
03:15:45,361 --> 03:15:46,194
general consensus.
I don't even know if it's a small 

4488
03:15:47,581 --> 03:15:49,560
number.
I think it's a fairly number.

4489
03:15:49,561 --> 03:15:50,190
It's just not

4490
03:15:50,190 --> 03:15:51,023
the consensus.
Why do you think that Asian cultures do 

4491
03:15:52,651 --> 03:15:56,400
better in school than American culture?
Probably discipline,

4492
03:15:56,670 --> 03:15:58,590
well a lot of it is that faith and 
intelligence,

4493
03:15:58,591 --> 03:15:59,424
they really believe practice makes 
perfect and if you work hard at 

4494
03:16:01,261 --> 03:16:03,420
something that you'll get better.
It's also cultural,

4495
03:16:03,421 --> 03:16:05,820
isn't it?
That is called talking about it for you.

4496
03:16:05,821 --> 03:16:06,654
Americans don't have that culture today.
They don't have that faith that if you 

4497
03:16:09,751 --> 03:16:12,450
bust your ass and you really work hard 
that you'll get better.

4498
03:16:12,690 --> 03:16:15,360
They did have that.
People have that idea.

4499
03:16:15,390 --> 03:16:17,820
Some do.
That's a giant generalization,

4500
03:16:17,930 --> 03:16:20,040
but look at the reserve funds don't 
have,

4501
03:16:20,041 --> 03:16:20,874
but look at the results.
Americas are massive hotbed of 

4502
03:16:23,380 --> 03:16:24,213
innovation and creativity and art,
which is the part which part of America 

4503
03:16:27,601 --> 03:16:29,700
in particular as a massive hotbed of 
innovation.

4504
03:16:29,850 --> 03:16:31,860
Which subculture?
It's silicon valley.

4505
03:16:32,070 --> 03:16:34,980
Silicon Valley is one.
It's an incredibly innovative.

4506
03:16:34,981 --> 03:16:36,330
What about the artistic community?

4507
03:16:36,330 --> 03:16:39,480
What about music?
There's massive amounts of comedy,

4508
03:16:39,690 --> 03:16:41,700
massive amounts of writing,
literature,

4509
03:16:41,701 --> 03:16:43,570
fiction.
A lot of it's coming from America.

4510
03:16:43,571 --> 03:16:45,750
All total,
all corners of the spot.

4511
03:16:45,900 --> 03:16:49,080
Totally.
But at the same time is the,

4512
03:16:49,110 --> 03:16:49,943
you know,
why aren't American students doing well 

4513
03:16:51,481 --> 03:16:54,090
in school?
Shitty students or Shitty,

4514
03:16:54,250 --> 03:16:55,740
excuse me.
Shitty teachers rather.

4515
03:16:55,770 --> 03:16:57,270
Shitty culture and well,
yeah,

4516
03:16:57,271 --> 03:16:58,104
that too,
and also a lack of a lack of resources 

4517
03:17:00,691 --> 03:17:03,270
being applied to schools.
I mean,

4518
03:17:03,271 --> 03:17:06,230
you find out what a teacher's salary is 
and you front out how little they.

4519
03:17:06,231 --> 03:17:08,550
They're respected women.
It's a real issue for sure.

4520
03:17:08,600 --> 03:17:09,110
Yeah,
we have,

4521
03:17:09,110 --> 03:17:12,630
I think we absolutely agree on that and 
a large part of it is that there are,

4522
03:17:12,670 --> 03:17:13,503
you know,
there are complicated fixes like fixing 

4523
03:17:15,600 --> 03:17:19,290
how much we pay teachers and all that 
sort of stuff and there are simple fixes

4524
03:17:19,380 --> 03:17:24,270
and things that we can fix pretty simply
and ideas that you can promote our,

4525
03:17:24,330 --> 03:17:25,770
you know,
embrace your mistakes,

4526
03:17:25,771 --> 03:17:27,660
analyze your mistakes,
fail forward,

4527
03:17:27,900 --> 03:17:28,733
and that is the I,
that is the cornerstone value of the 

4528
03:17:30,481 --> 03:17:31,314
FAA,
which is why you're safer flying than 

4529
03:17:32,581 --> 03:17:33,414
walking.
It's the cornerstone valley value of 

4530
03:17:35,131 --> 03:17:35,964
Silicon Valley and I will tell you that 
having worked with lots and lots of 

4531
03:17:38,611 --> 03:17:40,620
students and traveled all across the 
country,

4532
03:17:40,800 --> 03:17:44,340
that is not the core value of a lot of 
American students.

4533
03:17:44,420 --> 03:17:46,080
Then we got to wrap this up.
I'm so sorry.

4534
03:17:46,260 --> 03:17:47,730
It's already 5:00.
I'm in trouble.

4535
03:17:48,390 --> 03:17:49,350
Thank you very much,
man.

4536
03:17:49,351 --> 03:17:50,340
Really appreciate it.
Me.

4537
03:17:50,410 --> 03:17:51,243
Do it again man.
It seems like you've got a lot more to 

4538
03:17:52,091 --> 03:17:53,320
talk.
There's a lot of shock though.

4539
03:17:53,480 --> 03:17:54,740
Alright,
you fucks Cmr.

4540
03:17:54,870 --> 03:17:55,960
Bye.
You.

4541
03:17:56,570 --> 03:17:57,403
Sorry Dude.
