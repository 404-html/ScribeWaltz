1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,850
Her low freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:03,520
That was,

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,480
I was in Costa Rica and
fortunately we didn't have those,

4
00:00:06,481 --> 00:00:09,750
but we wanted to rough it
and my wife was just like,

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:09,991
yeah,

6
00:00:09,991 --> 00:00:10,260
listen,

7
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,250
I just want to go on in the middle.

8
00:00:11,251 --> 00:00:15,120
We fucking slept under a mosquito
net dude wear in the jungle.

9
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:15,841
I do.

10
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:16,890
We will put it this way.

11
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:19,030
We did a zip line tour
through the northern part of,

12
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,230
we did the rank rank.

13
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:20,611
Yeah,

14
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:21,151
we were right there.

15
00:00:21,151 --> 00:00:26,151
So we're staying under this
fucking mosquito net and
we have like United States

16
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,260
of America bug spray in like the rain
forest and it just laughing at that shit.

17
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,203
It's like,

18
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,720
it's like I'm shooting a pellet
gun and the guys get a 44 dude.

19
00:00:36,721 --> 00:00:37,321
It was like,

20
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:37,690
it was like,

21
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,630
I might as well put a one on two.

22
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,230
I had welts all up and down and
he'll bite in the shit out of us.

23
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,970
And I remember like the second day,

24
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,613
um,

25
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,121
this,

26
00:00:48,121 --> 00:00:50,410
these fucking army ants
just took over our,

27
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:51,420
our fucking little,

28
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,040
I don't even know what you'd call it.

29
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:54,770
There was like these ex
patriots had a fucking,

30
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,970
literally this giant tree
fort that they lived in,

31
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,180
and then they had these little bungalows
so that you had to walk up a ladder to

32
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:05,181
get into and these fucking things just
took over the place and the guy's like

33
00:01:06,061 --> 00:01:06,691
came on and I go,

34
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:06,841
yeah,

35
00:01:06,841 --> 00:01:07,080
I did.

36
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:07,591
I came,

37
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:07,801
I was like,

38
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:07,861
oh,

39
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:09,300
there's like a fucking
thousand ants in there.

40
00:01:09,301 --> 00:01:12,210
Like they were all in a single
file and he just came washed.

41
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:12,421
He goes,

42
00:01:12,421 --> 00:01:12,661
yeah,

43
00:01:12,661 --> 00:01:12,870
those,

44
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:13,501
the army ants.

45
00:01:13,501 --> 00:01:13,771
He goes,

46
00:01:13,771 --> 00:01:13,951
yeah,

47
00:01:13,951 --> 00:01:15,510
he just can't do anything about it.

48
00:01:15,511 --> 00:01:16,344
Uh,

49
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,360
was standing there looking
at him and I got like,

50
00:01:18,361 --> 00:01:19,740
these flip flops on and he goes,

51
00:01:19,741 --> 00:01:20,760
you can't do anything about,

52
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:21,070
I'm just,

53
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:22,200
you just got to let them pass through,

54
00:01:22,201 --> 00:01:23,280
take a couple of hours.

55
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:24,601
And he goes out,

56
00:01:24,601 --> 00:01:25,111
watch out though.

57
00:01:25,111 --> 00:01:27,570
They bite and write as he said
that one of them fucking bit me.

58
00:01:27,571 --> 00:01:28,321
And I was just like,

59
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:28,561
dude,

60
00:01:28,561 --> 00:01:29,580
you gotta be fucking kidding me.

61
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:31,470
So,

62
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:31,681
uh,

63
00:01:31,681 --> 00:01:35,490
so they had a monkey and
a spider monkey and pet.

64
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,420
Yup.

65
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,231
Not really a pet.

66
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:37,470
I mean,

67
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,910
not pet by its choice,

68
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,043
but he hung out.

69
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:40,670
Yay.

70
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:41,490
They had it.

71
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:41,701
No,

72
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:43,740
they had it as a pet by their choice.

73
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,510
The monkey was was a prisoner.

74
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,493
Oh,

75
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,143
so,

76
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,380
so he's an so I went
over there and it's done.

77
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,660
Now it's sitting on top of like,

78
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,510
it looks like a birdhouse silicon asshole.

79
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,810
I walk over to this fucking thing like
giving it food and everything and it

80
00:01:57,811 --> 00:02:00,990
fucking jumps on me in two seconds.

81
00:02:00,991 --> 00:02:03,360
It jumped on me inverted,

82
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,130
had its tail wrapped around my neck,

83
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,510
reached into my pockets,

84
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,890
took my bungalow keys and then ran up
the fucking tree with the keys to my

85
00:02:10,891 --> 00:02:13,550
bungalow so I couldn't fucking
get into it and it all,

86
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,680
it all went down in like fucking like
0.3 seconds and things just went fucking

87
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:23,910
that was standing there feeling subhuman.

88
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:24,511
I was like,

89
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,130
I just got out smarter by this thing.

90
00:02:26,131 --> 00:02:29,160
Like this is one for their side and
the monkey was up there looking at me.

91
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,380
I know it's fucking
laughing at me going like,

92
00:02:31,381 --> 00:02:32,790
oh you dumb mother fuckers.

93
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,740
Keep it right in your right front pocket.

94
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:35,880
I get it every time.

95
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,980
So then I was sitting there going like,

96
00:02:37,981 --> 00:02:38,490
all right,

97
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,420
all right motherfucker.

98
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,230
Right?

99
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,730
You want to have a battle of wits?

100
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:42,893
Here we go.

101
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:44,460
So I get some food,

102
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:45,983
right?

103
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,960
So I come down and I know I'm judging,

104
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:49,741
it's fucking leash,

105
00:02:49,741 --> 00:02:51,150
how far it can jump.

106
00:02:51,151 --> 00:02:54,270
So it Kinda get all the way back down
on its little fucking bird house,

107
00:02:54,271 --> 00:02:56,070
which was probably about three feet long.

108
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:00,010
So I'm sitting there walking with the
food and it knows I want the key and it's

109
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:02,770
actually holding the fucking key away
from its body and seeing if it can have

110
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:04,600
its cake and eat it like
a fucking human being.

111
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,710
Ooh.

112
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,580
So yeah.

113
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,481
Wow.

114
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:10,720
So I get the food and
when I did was I set it,

115
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:12,221
I,

116
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:14,750
I took a big chunk of
whatever the fuck it was was,

117
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,120
so we would need two hands.

118
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,030
So it's set down my keys.

119
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:21,760
So it's set down the keys on the
other side of the fucking thing.

120
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,870
And then it was walking,

121
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:27,310
it was slowly walking towards it
and right as it got to the food.

122
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,890
This is why I'm a sadistic
Gasol raise the got to the food,

123
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,610
I fucking slapped the food off the
house so it would be out of its reach.

124
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:38,611
And then I grabbed the fucking keys and
ran and this thing fucking leapt at me.

125
00:03:38,631 --> 00:03:39,464
I

126
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,041
swear to God,

127
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:47,041
I swear to God I could feel its breath
and I fucking made it away to the other

128
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:48,580
side of it.

129
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,520
And it was fucking pissed at
me and I was standing there.

130
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:52,750
This is the Middle Costa Rica going,

131
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:52,901
yeah,

132
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:54,130
fuck you motherfucker.

133
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:54,761
Fuck you.

134
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:55,594
Right.

135
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,580
So here's the funniest part,

136
00:03:57,581 --> 00:03:58,240
right?

137
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,980
So I go into my bungalow and I'm fucking
still kind of pissed at that fucking

138
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:07,810
thing and I go and unlock the door and
I'm sitting there for like 20 minutes

139
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,580
reading a book or whatever.

140
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,400
And then I just got on.

141
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:15,430
I just started thinking about the monkey
and I fucking looked out the window and

142
00:04:15,431 --> 00:04:18,400
it was sitting there all by itself
looking all sad and everything.

143
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:19,360
And then I felt bad.

144
00:04:19,361 --> 00:04:22,750
So then I went and I got food and
I didn't have my keys this time.

145
00:04:22,751 --> 00:04:24,980
And I actually kind of made
friends with the thing after that,

146
00:04:24,981 --> 00:04:26,620
but I felt when I saw
it all lonely and she,

147
00:04:26,621 --> 00:04:26,921
I was like,

148
00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:27,311
you know what?

149
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:28,160
This thing's a prisoner.

150
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,130
It doesn't want to fucking
be here and I'm being a dick.

151
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:31,720
I got to give it to food.

152
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,010
So I gave it back to it.

153
00:04:33,011 --> 00:04:33,191
Yeah.

154
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:33,920
I felt bad.

155
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,990
That's a happy ending.

156
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,393
The happy.

157
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,121
I felt bad.

158
00:04:37,121 --> 00:04:37,954
I don't get an inmate.

159
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:47,830
Okay.
