1
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,340
Okay,

2
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,560
the Joe Rogan experience

3
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:26,790
Joe Rogan podcast by Katie Bowman.

4
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,470
Ladies and gentlemen,
move your DNA.

5
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,140
You could find her on twitter aligned 
and.

6
00:00:33,141 --> 00:00:36,650
Well she's friends with Rob Wolf,
so she must be cool.

7
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,030
And you're here.
What's up?

8
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,170
How are you?
I'm doing well.

9
00:00:39,171 --> 00:00:39,950
How are you?
Good.

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,960
I didn't want to talk to you too much 
before the show because we were talking 

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,141
about something that I'm very interested
in about how you live in Washington 

12
00:00:47,141 --> 00:00:49,010
state.
You found some clever area where it's in

13
00:00:49,011 --> 00:00:53,180
Washington but it's not rainy every day 
where you actually get sun.

14
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,800
That's true.
How'd you do that?

15
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,560
Magic.
You know,

16
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:01,690
I followed my family that someone else 
found that magic and like how it always 

17
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:04,130
happens.
I decided to go up there too.

18
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,730
And it's uh,
you can see like Vancouver and Vancouver

19
00:01:08,731 --> 00:01:10,010
island right from where you're at.
Yeah.

20
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,850
I could row a boat to Canada if I had 
to.

21
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,690
If the shit hit the fan shit,
hit the fan and I got my out.

22
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,250
Well that's what you started talking 
about.

23
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:20,190
You started talking about like living 
off the wild and,

24
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,980
and that's something that you're really 
concerned with,

25
00:01:22,981 --> 00:01:23,850
like are you a prepper?

26
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,620
I'm not,
I,

27
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,090
I'm not really concerned with it,
but it Kinda goes hand in hand with what

28
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:35,091
I teach about natural movements,
like I'm trying to put back these 

29
00:01:35,091 --> 00:01:37,920
isolated pieces of how you eat and how 
you move and how you think and where you

30
00:01:37,921 --> 00:01:41,130
spend your time and even where you spend
your money of going.

31
00:01:41,131 --> 00:01:43,050
Well,
if we all just kind of go spend a little

32
00:01:43,051 --> 00:01:45,510
bit more time out in,
in nature.

33
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,640
Um,
but I mean more than the park.

34
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:49,050
I mean,
I really mean wild.

35
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,380
You can see how it's been done for a 
long period of time.

36
00:01:52,381 --> 00:01:57,381
So trying to figure out how to get more 
movement goes naturally with trying to 

37
00:01:57,381 --> 00:01:59,510
figure out how to acquire your own 
foods.

38
00:01:59,511 --> 00:02:02,580
So I thought,
well I'm a parent of two little kids.

39
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:07,581
I have a limited amount of time.
So what if our food acquisition is our 

40
00:02:07,581 --> 00:02:09,150
movement is our teaching,
our kids is our family,

41
00:02:09,151 --> 00:02:14,151
time is everything and it's the same 
hunk of time and we're just out there in

42
00:02:15,721 --> 00:02:16,590
the wild.
I love it.

43
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:21,500
Then you're in an area that's 
particularly like dense with wilderness,

44
00:02:21,501 --> 00:02:26,501
with trees,
with animals and that whole area of the 

45
00:02:26,501 --> 00:02:26,501
Pacific northwest.
It's such a.

46
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:31,190
When you were talking about how you come
to California and everything's so dry,

47
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,610
it's almost like where's the life?
But if you go up there,

48
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,830
there's so much life.
It's ridiculous.

49
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,360
Well,
I went up there with my friend Duncan.

50
00:02:38,361 --> 00:02:43,361
We were hunting for bigfoot,
was for a TV show and we went wandering 

51
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:44,750
through the woods.
But the thing,

52
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,550
the soaps,
that's my computer isn't working.

53
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,820
The sound wasn't working up until then.
We got an issue with stream.

54
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,600
This is,
we have a totally new setup.

55
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,380
So we're an hd now.
So you look lovely in hd.

56
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,260
Um,
we were,

57
00:02:59,261 --> 00:03:00,380
uh,
we,

58
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:05,381
we just got this new computer and this 
whole jazz and we would maybe we should 

59
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:07,000
just run the show for like a minute 
before we go live.

60
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,030
That's what we'll do next time,
but uh,

61
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,470
anyway,
when we went up there,

62
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:14,050
like when you're wandering around 
through the forest up there,

63
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:18,550
the thing that is so shocking is how 
many animals there are and how much life

64
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:23,551
there as you see elk crap everywhere and
all these birds and rodents and just so 

65
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:25,240
many,
so many,

66
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,130
so much variety of life up there

67
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,910
and that's the big stuff you can see 
underneath every footprint.

68
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:35,420
There's like one or 200 organisms living
in every foot footprint that you take 

69
00:03:35,971 --> 00:03:37,770
there because it's just,
it's so deep.

70
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,480
It's just dense.
Dense is,

71
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:43,560
it's the densest place on the planet.
It is dense of,

72
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,830
of plant and animal stuffs.

73
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:52,170
Yeah.
And you don't have to worry about 

74
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:52,170
drought up there.
Not this millennia.

75
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:57,300
Well,
not like we do here in California that 

76
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,461
we need 11 trillion gallons of water 
just to balance out what's been lost 

77
00:03:59,461 --> 00:03:59,461
over the last three years.

78
00:03:59,461 --> 00:04:00,230
Yeah.
And even more,

79
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:05,290
even even more.
I guess alarming to me is less than the 

80
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,470
total water,
but the amount of organization amongst 

81
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,850
people it takes to get it here like 
that.

82
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:11,510
I,
you know,

83
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,410
that's always what I was worried about 
failing here.

84
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,070
Yeah,
the water supply,

85
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,650
the food supply,
the infrastructure,

86
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,290
the infrastructure,
the delivery system,

87
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,330
because none of it is actually here 
like,

88
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,080
like I'm just thinking of something like
a power outage where so much of your 

89
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,801
water is dependent on it being cleaned 
and all of that is depends on energy 

90
00:04:32,991 --> 00:04:35,360
that requires a bunch of people.
Like my,

91
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:40,410
my in laws who live here in California,
their house has been without power for 

92
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:43,640
two weeks and they live in an area north
of Orange County and they had to bring a

93
00:04:43,641 --> 00:04:46,040
generator.
They put a generator into a neighborhood

94
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,030
because they're like,
well,

95
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:51,530
it's got to dig for it and frankly we 
don't have the manpower right now.

96
00:04:51,531 --> 00:04:53,270
And they're like,
when I started hearing stuff like that,

97
00:04:53,271 --> 00:04:55,850
that's when I flee to the Pacific 
northwest

98
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,450
so that there's an issue with their 
lines.

99
00:04:58,451 --> 00:05:03,451
The power lines are down or something 
like that and so they have to dig for 

100
00:05:03,451 --> 00:05:04,120
the lines to put them back up.
So to live in like the camping

101
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,320
for two weeks,
camping in a very affluent area in 

102
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,410
Orange County.
I mean this is like,

103
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,750
you know,
a nice neighborhood,

104
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,780
really nice neighborhood now where you 
live,

105
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:19,410
do you have neighbors?
And we do want me to have two and a half

106
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,690
acres and,
but there are,

107
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,330
there are some neighbors,
you know,

108
00:05:24,331 --> 00:05:27,930
but it's not um,
within the whole town,

109
00:05:27,931 --> 00:05:31,530
the whole town's pretty small and you 
can get to a place to see nobody,

110
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,080
you know,
within 10 minutes,

111
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,520
which I like.

112
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:40,780
Yeah,
that is nice if you want to get to 

113
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,731
nobody in 10 minutes.
But I find that like when you're in 

114
00:05:42,731 --> 00:05:46,810
small towns and small areas,
the real issue is finding a cool small 

115
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,160
town with a good sensibility,
a nice,

116
00:05:49,161 --> 00:05:52,190
intelligent small town.
Because you can find some small towns,

117
00:05:52,191 --> 00:05:55,760
like if you drive from southern 
California up to northern California,

118
00:05:55,761 --> 00:06:00,761
you can drive through some spots.
You have these giant Mitt Romney signs 

119
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:04,481
that are still up.
And there's the weird religious signs 

120
00:06:04,481 --> 00:06:06,230
and these strange really sketchy 
communities.

121
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:07,970
You're like,
oh boy,

122
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:10,130
you got a pretty view,
but fuck these neighbors.

123
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,560
Yeah,
it's a retirement community,

124
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,720
but you know,
you are where I am.

125
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,670
It's a retirement community because it 
was a,

126
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:17,890
it used to be a,
um,

127
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,490
a logging town,
so it's,

128
00:06:20,491 --> 00:06:22,730
it's got this waterway there,
it's next to some ports.

129
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:25,610
And so they've been moving with their 
and milling it up and there's some paper

130
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:28,490
mills,
but a lot of that business has shut down

131
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:30,740
as people are buying stuff from 
overseas.

132
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:35,741
And then of course as the wood is not 
being able to be replenished as fast as 

133
00:06:35,741 --> 00:06:39,891
they'd been taking it down.
So I think in sunset magazine somebody 

134
00:06:39,891 --> 00:06:44,801
wrote an article about this town that 
you could buy a few acres and,

135
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:48,290
and that it wasn't this what they call a
rain shadow.

136
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:51,530
So it's in the banana belt.
It's sunny almost every single day.

137
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:54,710
Totally different than any other place 
in Oregon or Washington.

138
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,050
And you could buy an acre for it long 
enough.

139
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,780
It was like $60,000
or $70,000.

140
00:06:59,781 --> 00:07:02,100
So a whole bunch of people went out 
there,

141
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,710
there's no,
there's no work or anything,

142
00:07:03,711 --> 00:07:07,070
but they bought their homes and they 
built them up,

143
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,920
but they're all kind of dying now.
The people,

144
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,050
the people who originally were there,
so,

145
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:17,620
so it's not that ideal,
small kind of funky ideal town yet.

146
00:07:18,891 --> 00:07:20,780
But I decided,
well I can make that happen.

147
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,850
You were going to make sure I can do 
that.

148
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:27,860
Like people in.
I'm not really about waiting around for 

149
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,130
the ideal to happen.
I'll just build it from the ground up.

150
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,110
Sure,
yeah,

151
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:29,900
there you go.

152
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,480
And so,
um,

153
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:36,570
this area that you're at,
do you take your kids out fishing and 

154
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,240
take them out gathering food and all 
that jazz?

155
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,290
Yeah.
So it's huge.

156
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:43,330
A huge reservation land where we are.
So the salmon is unreal.

157
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:46,210
I live on the dungeness river,
so all the crap,

158
00:07:46,211 --> 00:07:48,730
like all the crab that you met here from
Dungeness,

159
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,040
that's where it comes from.
So the,

160
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:56,190
the um,
the first nation peoples that lived 

161
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:56,190
there,
the food was so abundant,

162
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,190
like that's all the things like,
um,

163
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:03,090
totem poles and big dugout canoes that 
you see that came about because they 

164
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,830
didn't have to really worry about food.
It's like listless of elk today.

165
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,250
Let's just sit here until one walks by,
wait till Baird's walks by,

166
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:14,760
you know,
the berries and the fruit and the wild 

167
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,550
Greens and,
and then again the fish you could,

168
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,140
you know,
depending on the time of year,

169
00:08:17,141 --> 00:08:19,820
just grab one out of the water,
you know,

170
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,700
if they're sponsors,
it's not hard to eat there.

171
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,990
So I thought,
what a great place.

172
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:28,170
There's so many elk up there.
I took a photograph of an elk standing 

173
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:28,170
in front of a no hunting signs

174
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:29,300
close

175
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,290
because it was like,
right,

176
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:34,730
right when we were driving,
these elk were just wandering across the

177
00:08:34,731 --> 00:08:37,400
road and they were just standing in 
front of this no hunting.

178
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:38,720
So I'm like,
this is ridiculous.

179
00:08:38,721 --> 00:08:40,690
That was the first elk I'd ever seen in 
the wild to.

180
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,830
Those things are huge.
They're huge.

181
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,630
Yeah.
Like if you ever hit one with your car,

182
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:44,630
I

183
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:49,690
have not come close.
I've been waiting waiting for that to 

184
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:49,690
happen.
They don't seem.

185
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:53,441
That bright.
Light seems smarter than a lot of 

186
00:08:53,441 --> 00:08:53,441
people.
I know.

187
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,840
Maybe that shows the area that you're 
living with.

188
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,770
That's true.
They're cautious.

189
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:04,900
They're fleeting.
There's a little a herd of them that 

190
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,580
lives in our town there,
that mascot of this little town,

191
00:09:05,581 --> 00:09:10,581
and so there's a hurt and they've got 
collars around their neck and we've got 

192
00:09:10,581 --> 00:09:13,920
elk flashing lights so you can their 
colors because they just kind of.

193
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:18,950
Maybe they are dumb.
Maybe they just kind of stumbled across 

194
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,081
the freeway every now and then,
so they flash up when they're close to 

195
00:09:21,081 --> 00:09:21,930
the highway.
The one on either side is they're moving

196
00:09:21,931 --> 00:09:26,931
back and forth from the ocean,
so the gps collar collar that that the 

197
00:09:26,931 --> 00:09:28,590
government,
the local government is fitted them with

198
00:09:28,591 --> 00:09:33,591
so that they can kind of track where 
they're going to be in light the sign 

199
00:09:33,591 --> 00:09:36,821
up.
When the color comes close to these 

200
00:09:36,821 --> 00:09:36,821
signs,
you know,

201
00:09:36,821 --> 00:09:37,890
that's where the elk are.
So you can sometimes look up and see the

202
00:09:37,891 --> 00:09:40,710
whole herd sitting in the past year or 
you know,

203
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,120
maybe walking across the freeway

204
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,680
seems weird.
I feel like I kind of liked the idea 

205
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:47,720
that,
you know,

206
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:53,760
they know where they are,
but to put a collar on him and be able 

207
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:53,760
to track them and seems like that's not 
wild anymore.

208
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,190
Then you just roaming pet.

209
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:54,820
Yeah.
Yeah.

210
00:09:54,821 --> 00:09:58,480
Maybe it will their mascots wildish 
roaming mascots.

211
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,220
Wildish wildish eat them.
No.

212
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,420
No.
I mean by whom?

213
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,890
No,
like hunting laws.

214
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,450
No,
I don't.

215
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,670
I don't know if all of them are colored.
I think maybe just a couple of the males

216
00:10:09,671 --> 00:10:11,560
are so then no,
you wouldn't be allowed.

217
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:16,870
Kenny them really can't shoot them.
I don't know.

218
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,590
They're not,
they're not really like hunting area.

219
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,670
They're like in these kind of like the 
neighborhoods.

220
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,330
Maybe they're dumb.
Maybe they're totally.

221
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,020
You'd be amazed at some areas that you 
can hunt in there.

222
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:30,030
Like a,
there's an area called Evergreen 

223
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,170
Colorado and uh,
one of the issues that they have is the 

224
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,530
local laws allow you to essentially hunt
in your backyard.

225
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,620
If you have more than x amount of land,
not much,

226
00:10:37,621 --> 00:10:39,270
it's like two acres or something like 
that.

227
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:43,710
I might be butchering this law,
but I remember there was some sort of a,

228
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:48,711
um,
an issue online when people debating it 

229
00:10:48,711 --> 00:10:48,711
because people were firing off guns and 
their backyard,

230
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:51,900
like shooting it elk and deer and 
they're like,

231
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,160
oh,
this is kind of fucked up.

232
00:10:53,161 --> 00:10:55,740
Like we're not,
we're not really in the woods man.

233
00:10:55,741 --> 00:10:58,200
Like my swing set is 100 yards to the 
right.

234
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,330
So,
um,

235
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,720
but they have so many animals up there.
It's such a rich abundance of animals 

236
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,700
and the people that rely on them for a 
large part of their food,

237
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:13,701
you know,
moderate income or lower income 

238
00:11:13,701 --> 00:11:13,701
families,
if they get an elk,

239
00:11:13,701 --> 00:11:14,430
like,
boy that is a year's worth of meat.

240
00:11:14,431 --> 00:11:19,431
Like you've got a 1300 pound animal,
you're going to get 400 plus pounds of 

241
00:11:19,801 --> 00:11:22,620
meat from that.
That's 400 meals,

242
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,140
you know.
So for a lot of people that is literally

243
00:11:25,141 --> 00:11:30,141
a year's worth of meat for your family.
So they'll just shoot that fucker right 

244
00:11:30,141 --> 00:11:30,900
in their backyard.

245
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:32,980
Yep.

246
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,740
Everybody's got a duck for a couple 
minutes and come on over.

247
00:11:36,741 --> 00:11:41,741
I'll give you a ham.
The salmon fishing up there must be 

248
00:11:41,741 --> 00:11:41,780
amazing.

249
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,790
Amazing,
amazing.

250
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:46,040
Actually,
when does the weirdest going down?

251
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:46,690
You know,
they,

252
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,900
there was a dam up there for a really 
long time,

253
00:11:48,901 --> 00:11:50,840
like 100 years that they've just taken 
down.

254
00:11:50,841 --> 00:11:55,841
You can actually watch the 
deconstruction of this dam a couple of 

255
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:55,841
years

256
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:57,880
and we were walking around at the bottom
of what has been,

257
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,370
you know,
this damned up body of,

258
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:05,960
of water and some friends of ours were 
biologist took us upstream because 

259
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:10,381
they're there,
they're doing a lot of salmon 

260
00:12:10,381 --> 00:12:10,381
restoration,
you know,

261
00:12:10,381 --> 00:12:13,530
they're trying to get everything back to
what it was a couple of hundred years 

262
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:16,180
ago because it's very different because 
of this dam.

263
00:12:16,181 --> 00:12:21,181
And he is our friend Keith.
He just reached down and he picked up 

264
00:12:21,181 --> 00:12:22,990
the salmon like right out of the water,
this huge thing.

265
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:26,260
I mean the thing was a foot and a half 
more.

266
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:29,650
It was 15 pounds and he just picked it 
right up and he was like,

267
00:12:29,651 --> 00:12:31,360
here's where the eggs are.
And then he.

268
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:36,420
Then it turned out to be a male and he 
just grabbed it and he just shot all of 

269
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,390
the salmon.
Salmon is also the river because they're

270
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,330
spawning and he just,
he just deals with salmon all day long.

271
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,400
It was amazing.
Was opponent out of a weird,

272
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,510
like a salmon?
We're.

273
00:12:43,511 --> 00:12:48,511
Or was he pulling out of the river was 
retarded because they're spawning so 

274
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,480
when they're spawning they just rub up 
against anything.

275
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:53,960
Well they're just,
when they're spawning,

276
00:12:53,961 --> 00:12:55,360
you know,
they're trying to get to kind of shallow

277
00:12:55,361 --> 00:12:57,100
water.
So a lot of them are kind of,

278
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:02,160
you know,
they have to make it up through the 

279
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:02,160
river even as the river changes in terms
of volumes.

280
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,260
So where it's a little low,
they just kind of walk up.

281
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,720
It kind of take themselves out of the 
water.

282
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:08,650
They're,
they're amazing.

283
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:15,300
Well,
I mean I've seen bears pulled them out 

284
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,731
on tv,
like in deeper waters because they're 

285
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:18,520
jumping.
These ones are actually on the ground,

286
00:13:18,521 --> 00:13:21,460
but they're just wiggling.
Yeah.

287
00:13:21,461 --> 00:13:23,860
So he said the females will be way more 
scratched up.

288
00:13:23,861 --> 00:13:28,861
You can tell during spawning season a 
male versus a female because the female 

289
00:13:28,861 --> 00:13:31,830
is just really desperately trying to get
her eggs to someplace.

290
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:36,460
And I guess the male just drop his load 
kind of wherever he's less intense about

291
00:13:36,461 --> 00:13:38,440
it.
Goofy designed by nature,

292
00:13:38,441 --> 00:13:39,580
Huh?
Yeah.

293
00:13:39,581 --> 00:13:44,581
Or,
or just amazing like in what I find 

294
00:13:44,581 --> 00:13:47,350
interesting is so salmon that they're 
raising in,

295
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,020
um,
whatever they call it,

296
00:13:50,021 --> 00:13:51,570
like in the fisheries,
you know,

297
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:56,580
in the hatcheries,
the identify them because they remove 

298
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:56,800
what they will call like a vestibular 
Finn.

299
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,800
This,
I think it's called an adipose Finn.

300
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:04,480
Um,
so that they can recognize which ones 

301
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:04,480
are wild in which ones are introduced.
But,

302
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,480
but um,
and I was talking to some biologists in 

303
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,720
part of a lot of stuff that I do is,
is kind of redefining what's actually 

304
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,750
this digital era and what's just,
we don't know what it is,

305
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,780
so it must not be necessary anymore.
And he said,

306
00:14:16,781 --> 00:14:21,781
well,
it's interesting because he was 

307
00:14:21,781 --> 00:14:22,090
explaining it's kind of like the 
appendix of the fish.

308
00:14:22,091 --> 00:14:23,500
It's not really necessary.
And I was like,

309
00:14:23,501 --> 00:14:28,501
well,
it turns out that our appendix isn't 

310
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:28,501
really as digital as it was once 
thought,

311
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:29,020
you know,
it's a little bit more necessary.

312
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,340
And it is.
Yeah,

313
00:14:30,341 --> 00:14:35,341
it's not,
it has a role whether that role is 

314
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,870
challenged by modern living,
that's really more where,

315
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,480
what the issue is.
If it still is,

316
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,900
it still is harboring.
I can't remember exactly what it is.

317
00:14:43,901 --> 00:14:48,901
It's harboring some sort of bacteria 
depending on the exposure.

318
00:14:50,351 --> 00:14:52,010
You have two different foodstuffs and 
I'll

319
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,750
have to look it up a little bit more.
But.

320
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:59,290
But he said it's interesting that you 
say that because they're wondering why 

321
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:00,110
these fish don't do really,
really well.

322
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:05,140
So perhaps it's because they're removing
the fin and as I did a little bit more 

323
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:09,281
research on that fin that Finn in 
particular deals with assisting swimming

324
00:15:09,351 --> 00:15:11,930
through very particular types of 
turbulence.

325
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,520
And so it,
it is,

326
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:16,160
it's not something that you use 100 
percent of the time,

327
00:15:16,161 --> 00:15:18,240
but it's used over the lifetime of a 
salmon.

328
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:22,310
Just put like a tag on that thing 
instead of dragging it off.

329
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,780
Too much drag.
I don't know.

330
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:27,290
I don't know.
I don't know,

331
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,750
there's so many problems to solve and so
little time,

332
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:34,950
well,
so many problems to solve when your 

333
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:34,950
people and you want to fuck with 
animals,

334
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:38,270
want to cut their fins off and put 
collars on their elk in this area that 

335
00:15:38,351 --> 00:15:40,960
you live in.
Sounds like ideally it sounds beautiful.

336
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:45,990
It is.
And does this have anything to do with 

337
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:49,801
what you do for a living?
Does it have anything to do with what 

338
00:15:49,801 --> 00:15:51,160
you're all about?
Movement and alignment and

339
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:56,480
like I'm all about natural movement and 
an alignment being a component of that,

340
00:15:57,601 --> 00:16:02,601
but I would say that the reason we moved
up there as we were just unable to 

341
00:16:02,601 --> 00:16:05,460
execute our life the way with we wanted 
here,

342
00:16:05,461 --> 00:16:06,250
like there was,
there's a,

343
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:11,340
there's a physical blockage to moving in
the way that we need to move and I was 

344
00:16:11,731 --> 00:16:16,731
like,
well the only way to remove that 

345
00:16:16,731 --> 00:16:18,501
blockage is to take ourselves away from 
the environment that's limiting this,

346
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,340
this way of moving,
which is,

347
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,710
which is larger than it sounds.
It's not like,

348
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:27,950
you know,
make sure you get these seven exercises 

349
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:27,950
into your workout.
It's,

350
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:31,411
it's,
it's very broad and it has to do with 

351
00:16:31,411 --> 00:16:34,280
the loads that your body experiences and
then that goes for light and noise and 

352
00:16:34,621 --> 00:16:38,400
all the different ways your cells are 
deformed by your habitat.

353
00:16:38,401 --> 00:16:40,470
So if,
when you talk about,

354
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:45,000
when I talk about movement,
I really like in the way that we move to

355
00:16:45,001 --> 00:16:50,001
be similar to animals that are in zoos.
Like if you ever go to a zoo and check 

356
00:16:50,701 --> 00:16:55,701
out that kind of unfortunate thing,
you'll see these animals and they have 

357
00:16:55,701 --> 00:16:55,701
movement,
you know,

358
00:16:55,701 --> 00:16:55,860
they have,

359
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,890
yeah,
cages or habitats designed for them,

360
00:16:59,891 --> 00:17:04,891
but the way that they used them is 
pretty narrow and it goes for us as 

361
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:04,891
well.
So that's,

362
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:05,770
that's,
that's why the move.

363
00:17:05,771 --> 00:17:08,440
I just wanted less people,
more space,

364
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,710
less rules,
less noise,

365
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,370
more water.

366
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:17,870
Yeah.
And when you say like we're being 

367
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:17,870
deformed or like in what way?

368
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,660
Well in the book,
the analogy that I use,

369
00:17:20,661 --> 00:17:25,661
because I think it's easiest to 
understand is if you look at workers in 

370
00:17:25,661 --> 00:17:29,030
a place like sea world,
have you seen their folded over fin?

371
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,730
That's the kind of defamation that I'm 
talking about.

372
00:17:31,731 --> 00:17:35,840
I'm talking about like um,
you are shaped really by the forces that

373
00:17:35,841 --> 00:17:40,841
you experience all the time.
Your mechanical environment is 100 

374
00:17:40,841 --> 00:17:44,390
percent of the time and so the resultant
shape of your body

375
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:50,760
is based on this exposure in the same 
way that the Orca was missing input,

376
00:17:50,761 --> 00:17:55,560
it was missing mechanical input and it 
was exposed to high levels of mechanical

377
00:17:55,561 --> 00:17:59,460
input that gets this result in shape,
you know,

378
00:17:59,461 --> 00:18:04,461
in,
in the difference between what the Orca 

379
00:18:04,461 --> 00:18:04,461
is.
When you look at an Orca,

380
00:18:04,461 --> 00:18:07,731
it's like clearly it's not supposed to 
be at seaworld and clearly that shaped 

381
00:18:07,731 --> 00:18:09,150
doesn't seem conducive to swimming,
you know,

382
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:14,320
at least in a straight line.
So we don't see that in ourselves very 

383
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,411
well though because we are the Orca in 
the tank and everyone else is in the 

384
00:18:18,411 --> 00:18:20,550
tank with us.
So it's really hard to see how you would

385
00:18:20,551 --> 00:18:25,551
have been shaped and it's really hard to
imagine what the resultant shape of us 

386
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:31,820
would be culturally if,
if there were more examples of people 

387
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,300
who moved in drastically different ways,
which there are not.

388
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:38,800
Well,
I know posture is a big issue with 

389
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,241
Americans.
It's a big issue with anybody in all 

390
00:18:41,241 --> 00:18:41,241
parts of the world that have to sit at 
desks all the time.

391
00:18:41,241 --> 00:18:46,221
You know,
the expression sitting is the new 

392
00:18:46,221 --> 00:18:46,350
smoking.
We've tried really hard in this place to

393
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:51,590
change that up.
We've got these desks or these chairs 

394
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:51,800
from Ergo depot.
These are called Cup Pisco.

395
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:57,140
I had a couple different ones before I 
started off with regular chairs like 

396
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:57,690
that,
but by the end of the podcast,

397
00:18:57,691 --> 00:19:01,370
my back,
I've had some back issues with Jujitsu.

398
00:19:01,371 --> 00:19:06,371
I had a bulging disc at one point,
my cervical spine and that's all healed 

399
00:19:06,371 --> 00:19:10,911
up now,
but if I sit in something like that and 

400
00:19:10,911 --> 00:19:12,780
I kind of have that hunch thing that you
get from a chair by the end of the show,

401
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:15,390
I'll just get stiff in my back.
But with these things,

402
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:20,480
nothing.
So something that forces you to sit 

403
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,021
erect,
you realize like how few of us actually 

404
00:19:24,021 --> 00:19:26,841
do that and how many people are like 
have that weird hunch spine thing going 

405
00:19:26,841 --> 00:19:30,681
on,
which constantly puts pressure on your 

406
00:19:30,681 --> 00:19:33,471
spine and I never thought anything of 
that until I started doing this fucking 

407
00:19:33,471 --> 00:19:35,250
podcast and I'm like sitting down all 
the time,

408
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,180
all day.

409
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,420
And it just,
it really puts into perspective how many

410
00:19:39,421 --> 00:19:42,120
people are doing it.
Not Me for three hours a day.

411
00:19:42,121 --> 00:19:43,020
They're doing eight,
nine,

412
00:19:43,021 --> 00:19:46,230
10 hours a day even more staring at 
computers all day.

413
00:19:46,231 --> 00:19:48,100
Everyone's going blind early.
Right?

414
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:48,710
You know,
I'm uh,

415
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,580
my,
my vision sucks.

416
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,830
It used to be really good,
but now I need,

417
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:58,040
I need reading glasses to read stuff 
that's close up and I know it has 

418
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,911
something to do with age,
but it definitely has something to do 

419
00:20:01,911 --> 00:20:01,911
with staring at monitors too.
It's just not good for you.

420
00:20:01,911 --> 00:20:02,860
No.
And it's the distance,

421
00:20:02,861 --> 00:20:03,310
you know.
Um,

422
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,680
I,
I tried to talk about casts,

423
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,120
casts,
casts.

424
00:20:07,121 --> 00:20:09,520
When you break your arm,
those are really easy to see.

425
00:20:09,521 --> 00:20:11,950
There's like a physical structure that 
you can't move your arm.

426
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:17,220
It's really harder to see these 
invisible casts so distance the distance

427
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:21,850
of something from your eye is a cast 
upon the Lens,

428
00:20:21,851 --> 00:20:25,350
so when you look at something,
what allows you to focus on that is that

429
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,860
the distance that you're looking at,
your,

430
00:20:27,861 --> 00:20:29,410
your mind,
your,

431
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:34,420
your musculature of the.
I will change the shape of your lens so 

432
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,830
that that distance is what you're 
looking at.

433
00:20:35,831 --> 00:20:40,831
When you want to see something farther,
you look up and you look at it and then 

434
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:44,641
these muscles,
these ciliary muscles in the eye will 

435
00:20:44,641 --> 00:20:46,420
change the shape of the eye and allow 
you to focus that to that distance.

436
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:51,990
But humans,
modern humans in the places where we 

437
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:55,600
live very rarely look beyond 20 feet.

438
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,850
I mean you're not looking at anything.
I mean,

439
00:20:57,851 --> 00:21:02,851
so like you can say that it's the screen
because the screen is two feet away and 

440
00:21:02,851 --> 00:21:05,320
there's certainly a much greater 
frequency of screen use.

441
00:21:05,321 --> 00:21:10,321
Like by the time you look at your ipod 
or your iphone and you're looking at 

442
00:21:10,321 --> 00:21:12,340
your computer and doing whatever work 
that's on that,

443
00:21:12,341 --> 00:21:17,341
that number has gone up.
But what's always been high is that you 

444
00:21:17,341 --> 00:21:19,480
don't see much beyond the walls of your 
house.

445
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,670
So that's another reason you don't have 
the ability to look very far indoors,

446
00:21:24,671 --> 00:21:28,510
does not allow you to look very far.
And so right now with that vision,

447
00:21:28,511 --> 00:21:30,670
with kind of understanding like why is 
Myopia,

448
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
which is that near sightedness coming up
with such great frequency years to be 

449
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,030
one kid in school with glasses,
right?

450
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:42,660
And now there are seven or eight,
you got one third of the classroom who 

451
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:46,951
can't see at ages six and seven kids are
starting now to be put in glasses like 

452
00:21:46,951 --> 00:21:49,060
in four and five years old because 
they've been looking.

453
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,010
They don't even have outdoor playtime,
you know,

454
00:21:51,011 --> 00:21:56,011
they're not even going outside.
And so they know that outdoor time is a 

455
00:21:58,421 --> 00:22:02,400
factor in those and have less myopia.
So then they're trying to test it like,

456
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,460
is it the near work?
And I,

457
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:09,280
I wrote a piece about this that there's 
a difference between going outside.

458
00:22:09,281 --> 00:22:10,540
So they're like,
is it the vitamin D?

459
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:15,541
Is it the light exposure?
But they were able to figure out by 

460
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:16,910
isolation that it wasn't that,
and so then I.

461
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,190
my contribution is,
well,

462
00:22:18,191 --> 00:22:23,191
what about distance looking?
That distance looking itself is a 

463
00:22:23,191 --> 00:22:24,280
different variable in something that you
don't.

464
00:22:24,281 --> 00:22:27,610
It's not a load to the eye that we're,
I'm very experienced with.

465
00:22:27,611 --> 00:22:31,390
But if you had to again go out and get 
your food and you were moving around,

466
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:33,670
it's not just that you're outside more.
It's a.

467
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,310
You need to be able to see things kind 
of far away.

468
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:38,530
If you've ever gone hunting.
Hunting is,

469
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,680
especially if we're doing like spot and 
stock type hunting,

470
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:45,430
being able to look at long distances and
seeing and spotting animals,

471
00:22:45,431 --> 00:22:47,200
you know,
before you make your way over there,

472
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,440
that's a skill to be able to look 30 or 
40 or 60 feet to the top of a tree to 

473
00:22:52,991 --> 00:22:55,480
kind of see what's up in there.
That's just a.

474
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,850
it's a part of your workout that you're 
missing,

475
00:22:57,851 --> 00:23:00,280
so to speak.
You're not cross training your eyes with

476
00:23:00,281 --> 00:23:05,281
enough types of exercises.
You do two feet and you do however far 

477
00:23:05,281 --> 00:23:06,300
your television is,
and then maybe the.

478
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,670
The bumper of the car in front of you,
I mean we're not distance lookers at all

479
00:23:09,671 --> 00:23:10,090
anymore,

480
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:13,060
so have ophthalmologists and 
optometrists have,

481
00:23:13,061 --> 00:23:15,220
they've sort of just accepted the fact 
that people,

482
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:20,400
their eyes are just going to go bad 
because this is the environment we live 

483
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,101
in.
So this is just an inevitable fact of 

484
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:24,811
aging.
And is that something that can be 

485
00:23:24,811 --> 00:23:24,811
avoided by spending a lot of time 
outdoors,

486
00:23:24,811 --> 00:23:29,341
looking at long distance stuff and 
looking at things that are 100 yards 

487
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:29,970
away,
500 yards away and focusing your,

488
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,210
your vision on those things?

489
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:31,910
Yeah.
Well I don't,

490
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,800
I don't think they want you to accept 
it.

491
00:23:33,801 --> 00:23:35,840
It's not.
I mean it's not an inevitable thing.

492
00:23:35,841 --> 00:23:37,610
That's why they're working on the 
literature for it.

493
00:23:37,611 --> 00:23:42,080
So the actual researchers in eyes are 
trying to find like what it is,

494
00:23:42,081 --> 00:23:45,620
do we need more supplementation?
But they're like,

495
00:23:45,621 --> 00:23:46,160
kids really

496
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,790
do need to be outside a lot more.
Um,

497
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:51,710
because the shape of the size of your 
eye is changing.

498
00:23:51,711 --> 00:23:56,711
And so when the eye freezes or as cast 
by something near and then your eyes 

499
00:23:56,981 --> 00:23:59,900
start growing,
but the lens has to stay the same size,

500
00:23:59,901 --> 00:24:02,540
then you have this mismatch between the 
size of your eye and the Lens.

501
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:07,541
And so that's why this childhood myopia 
kind of starts moving with you into 

502
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:10,280
adulthood and you become an adult that 
needs glasses.

503
00:24:10,281 --> 00:24:11,540
So.
So yes,

504
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:16,541
they are calling for that intervention.
And then there's a lot of I exercise 

505
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,560
programs,
you know,

506
00:24:18,561 --> 00:24:21,590
people trying to create some sort of 
corrective.

507
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:26,650
My recommendation is you got to get 
yourself near a window if you're an 

508
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:26,650
office worker and you have to just take 
an eyebrow,

509
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:29,300
you need to look as far away as possible
just to.

510
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,540
It's like if you did a bunch of curls,
bicep curls,

511
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:35,330
and you never ever put your arm down,
it's like you did them all.

512
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:38,000
And then when you were done,
you tied it up there.

513
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:43,210
You can imagine what the shape of the 
bicep would look like and the function 

514
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:46,601
of the elbow and the shoulder and how 
eventually that bicep would not just 

515
00:24:46,601 --> 00:24:48,830
pull your lower arm up to your upper 
arm,

516
00:24:48,831 --> 00:24:51,680
but would start to pull your shoulder in
towards your upper arm.

517
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,210
Same thing goes with the eyes,
you know,

518
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:57,260
first the muscles that move the shape of
the Lens,

519
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,450
do that,
but then the tighter they are,

520
00:24:59,451 --> 00:25:03,080
the more they begin to pull the whole 
structure of the eyeball down itself.

521
00:25:03,081 --> 00:25:04,970
And then you're starting to look at,
well,

522
00:25:04,971 --> 00:25:06,500
how does that affect the pressure of the
eye?

523
00:25:06,501 --> 00:25:09,800
And in,
in so many things that occur in the body

524
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:11,570
are,
um,

525
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,630
mechanically sensitive.
You know,

526
00:25:14,631 --> 00:25:19,631
you,
all your pressures are depend on all 

527
00:25:19,631 --> 00:25:21,311
your pressures everywhere else.
And when you start to forming the shape 

528
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:24,521
of structures,
it does start effecting those functions 

529
00:25:24,521 --> 00:25:26,510
that are positioned dependent,
which is almost all of them

530
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,250
sort of like when people were a wallet 
in their pockets,

531
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:32,790
bulging discs.
That's a really common thing with folks.

532
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:38,030
Have you,
you don't know if you have a wallet and 

533
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:38,030
you put it in your back pocket,
please stop doing it.

534
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:38,250
Um,
I recently,

535
00:25:38,251 --> 00:25:43,251
I used to get mocked because I had a 
wallet chain because I lost my wallet 

536
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:44,490
twice.
Okay.

537
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,890
Relax people.
Plus they look kind of sweet.

538
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,020
But uh,
I got this wallet recently.

539
00:25:49,021 --> 00:25:54,021
It's a front pocket wallet,
just keeps a few credit cards and my 

540
00:25:54,021 --> 00:25:57,441
driver's license and that's it.
I went and minimalist and ever since I 

541
00:25:57,441 --> 00:26:00,891
did that I just,
I'm aware that I can just sit down and 

542
00:26:00,891 --> 00:26:01,500
have to pull it because I would always 
take my wallet out of my pocket and then

543
00:26:01,501 --> 00:26:03,720
sit down,
which is one of the reasons why I wanted

544
00:26:03,721 --> 00:26:05,670
it attached to a chain because I'm 
absentminded,

545
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:08,430
but people that have these big fat 
wallet,

546
00:26:08,431 --> 00:26:09,990
everybody gives you a business card all.

547
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:12,390
Let me just stick that in there.
You're sitting on a brick,

548
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,550
you know,
you're sitting on an encyclopedia,

549
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:19,730
stuff that sucker into your pocket and 
you've got this weird angle that you're 

550
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:22,941
at all the time.
You're always sitting in a weird lump 

551
00:26:22,941 --> 00:26:24,990
and soft tissue is very pliable and 
that's something that.

552
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:30,530
It's also something that really 
frustrated me about getting a back 

553
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:31,110
injury was how many people were like,
well,

554
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,400
you're going to have to get surgery,
and I was like,

555
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,510
oh,
what the fuck?

556
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:37,830
Like there's no way to fix this.
There's no way to stretch this out.

557
00:26:37,831 --> 00:26:39,390
There's no way to.
It's compressed,

558
00:26:39,391 --> 00:26:40,260
right?
Have suffered Capri.

559
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,320
Is there a way to decompress it?
And then I went to other people and 

560
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:45,320
like,
yeah,

561
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:45,320
of course we do decompression therapy.
Like,

562
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,200
okay,
well what the fuck?

563
00:26:46,201 --> 00:26:51,201
Well,
how come this doctor is telling me that 

564
00:26:51,201 --> 00:26:51,201
you got to cut my back,
and then there's.

565
00:26:51,201 --> 00:26:52,200
Have you ever heard of the reverse hyper
machine?

566
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,150
Yes.
Louie Simmons,

567
00:26:54,151 --> 00:26:56,460
this guy from west side barbell in 
Columbus,

568
00:26:56,461 --> 00:26:58,980
Ohio,
created this amazing machine that I have

569
00:26:58,981 --> 00:27:01,350
in the back now that I use almost every 
day.

570
00:27:01,351 --> 00:27:06,351
It's fantastic because it offers 
decompression and this incredible 

571
00:27:06,351 --> 00:27:09,441
strengthening of the back.
It's this amazing machine that as you 

572
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:15,050
you're lifting up your.
You're flexing your back and is very 

573
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:19,101
unusual way that it's really hard to 
work out any other way and then on the 

574
00:27:19,101 --> 00:27:21,930
release it's actually actively 
decompressing your spine,

575
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:27,200
so it's because of guys like him.
Louis Siemens is powerlifter genius,

576
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:32,330
sort of bio mechanic dude who figured 
out he had an injury and they wanted a 

577
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:34,740
fuses discs and he was like,
fuck that,

578
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:39,770
you know,
let me let me figure out a way around 

579
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:39,770
this,
and he figured out a way and he fixed it

580
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:39,770
and he fixed it through this.

581
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:44,900
Just using what he knows about exercise 
and the mechanics of the body and coming

582
00:27:45,961 --> 00:27:50,961
up with some sort of machine that would 
allow the decompression of that soft 

583
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:55,290
tissue and that's something that I think
we all have to be aware of when it comes

584
00:27:55,291 --> 00:27:58,350
to posture.
Posture is a giant one with people.

585
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:03,330
I had terrible posture like most of my 
life until I started getting back issues

586
00:28:03,331 --> 00:28:06,960
and one of the things that I realized is
even though I was healthy and strong,

587
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:11,160
I was able to avoid a lot of pain that 
was associated with that bad posture.

588
00:28:11,161 --> 00:28:16,161
The bad posture was still screwing me up
and like just being able to sit up 

589
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:18,270
straight.
It just feels odd when you do it,

590
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,250
but if you do it and like you force 
your,

591
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,280
it's like an active exercise.
You force yourself to do it,

592
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:28,320
you want a slump because it's like you 
feel like you're using less energy but 

593
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:28,680
you're really screwing your body up when
you do it

594
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,510
and you're using less energy.
Yeah.

595
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,900
Which is,
which is fine in some cases.

596
00:28:34,901 --> 00:28:36,880
I mean using less energy is good in some
cases,

597
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:40,530
but I think it has has less to do with 
like with good posture,

598
00:28:40,531 --> 00:28:42,130
but the thing with the thing with 
posture,

599
00:28:42,131 --> 00:28:47,131
his posture is this modern construct 
that has arisen in a culture that 

600
00:28:48,071 --> 00:28:49,390
doesn't move at all.
Right?

601
00:28:49,391 --> 00:28:53,200
So it's really like what's the optimal 
way to be still because that's the wrong

602
00:28:53,201 --> 00:28:55,660
question or asking kind of the wrong 
question.

603
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:57,010
Yes.
That's the first question.

604
00:28:57,011 --> 00:29:02,011
The first question is to assume that 
there is nothing you can change about 

605
00:29:02,011 --> 00:29:02,300
your life,
that you can't move to a wonderful place

606
00:29:02,301 --> 00:29:05,800
in,
cultivate a wonderful city to live in,

607
00:29:05,801 --> 00:29:07,990
but right now if you feel stuck in your 
job,

608
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:13,000
the tendency is to make that environment
better,

609
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:18,150
but I always like to point out that 
posture isn't something that you would 

610
00:29:18,731 --> 00:29:23,731
be as concerned about if you were moving
a lot more in general that the resting 

611
00:29:23,731 --> 00:29:25,660
tensions of your body would be doing all
the things that you know,

612
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:29,170
we're trying to do in small blips on,
on different machines,

613
00:29:29,171 --> 00:29:30,310
in posture classes.
You know,

614
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:33,130
in posture books.
They just got to move more to.

615
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:38,920
And also even standing up though,
even if you are moving,

616
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:44,160
like there's a lot of people that move 
and they of have that hunch for thing 

617
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,371
going on and even if you're out there 
doing stuff like especially like when 

618
00:29:47,371 --> 00:29:50,911
you're exercising you,
you put a tremendous amount of pressure 

619
00:29:50,911 --> 00:29:54,451
on your back and really weird ways if 
you don't use proper posture like with 

620
00:29:54,451 --> 00:29:55,570
squats and things along those lines.
It's so super important.

621
00:29:55,630 --> 00:30:00,630
Yeah.
Forum forum is huge during your workout 

622
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:01,000
and all the other times too.

623
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,050
Yeah,
and form for everything,

624
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,210
not just for lifting weights for martial
arts,

625
00:30:05,211 --> 00:30:06,380
of course,
this gigantic,

626
00:30:06,381 --> 00:30:07,490
you know,
doing things correctly.

627
00:30:07,491 --> 00:30:12,491
If you do things incorrectly,
you put a lot of load on weird areas of 

628
00:30:12,491 --> 00:30:15,521
your joints and your hips and your back.
And so many people want to be healthier.

629
00:30:16,671 --> 00:30:21,671
So many people want to be.
They wanted to get out of this Rut 

630
00:30:21,671 --> 00:30:22,400
they're in and,
and get there.

631
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:27,670
But it seems like the,
just a modern life that most people are 

632
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:33,130
either found themselves in by 
circumstance by lack of understanding,

633
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:36,730
but whatever it is you find yourself in 
this,

634
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:41,800
this way or this way of life,
which it almost makes it 

635
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:45,500
incomprehensibly difficult to like be 
healthy,

636
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,820
to be fit,
to be,

637
00:30:46,821 --> 00:30:51,590
to have a body that functions correctly.
If you're sitting in a desk all day,

638
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:56,920
like what are the things that people 
should be concentrating on if they find 

639
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,160
themselves stuck in a work environment,
you're in a cubicle.

640
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,870
Like is there a way to mitigate that?

641
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,670
There is.
Um,

642
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:06,680
I think one of the things that I've 
known for most is that thinking,

643
00:31:06,681 --> 00:31:08,660
if you think about in terms of like your
exercise,

644
00:31:08,661 --> 00:31:10,180
a lot of people will try to figure out 
like,

645
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,520
healthy to them as what are you doing 
for exercise?

646
00:31:13,521 --> 00:31:15,160
What are you eating for your diet?
So you're,

647
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:20,350
you're,
you're trying to maximize those two 

648
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:20,910
categories,
but um,

649
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:25,990
you've got all of this other time in 
which you are getting your work done and

650
00:31:26,511 --> 00:31:31,511
you can make that healthier too.
So like we know you were talking about 

651
00:31:31,511 --> 00:31:32,150
your wallet for example,
when I was thinking,

652
00:31:32,151 --> 00:31:37,151
you know,
you put this big hunk under one hip and 

653
00:31:37,151 --> 00:31:39,431
so you take it out.
Well a lot of people put two big hunks 

654
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:43,960
of wallet,
dish type stuff under their feet every 

655
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,330
single day.
And they call them shoes.

656
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:45,710
You know,
they'll put like a big,

657
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,310
big wedge about high heels.

658
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,790
I'm talking about trainers,
you know,

659
00:31:49,791 --> 00:31:53,420
like your athletic shoe could have an 
inch and a quarter is standard,

660
00:31:53,421 --> 00:31:56,000
a man's dress shoes almost two full 
inches.

661
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:59,570
We'd,
it's not sin in spiky and Fashiony,

662
00:31:59,571 --> 00:32:04,571
but,
but that is the equivalent to the 

663
00:32:04,571 --> 00:32:05,030
wallet.
It's just because it's symmetrical.

664
00:32:05,031 --> 00:32:05,750
We think of,
well,

665
00:32:05,751 --> 00:32:07,640
it's symmetrical,
like the thing,

666
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:11,540
your wallet under your hip.
It's not just that it's asymmetrical.

667
00:32:11,541 --> 00:32:16,541
If you had a wallet in each hip,
either the problems of having something 

668
00:32:16,541 --> 00:32:17,390
underneath under that soft tissue would 
still be there.

669
00:32:17,391 --> 00:32:19,940
It would just.
It would be more subtle.

670
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:22,460
You wouldn't have this big torque there 
as well.

671
00:32:22,461 --> 00:32:24,260
It would just be kind of continuous 
pressure,

672
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:29,650
but people put stuff on their feet every
single day that affects every other 

673
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:33,191
joint north of their ankle.
And then you compensate all day long 

674
00:32:33,191 --> 00:32:34,100
your whole entire life you've been 
compensating.

675
00:32:34,101 --> 00:32:37,940
And over time you lose.
You lose parts to your body.

676
00:32:37,941 --> 00:32:40,300
You lose little.
The little contract

677
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:45,460
components that make up muscle,
like the sarcomeres that make up your 

678
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:45,460
muscle length.
Those just go away.

679
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,430
You cannibalize those,
um,

680
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:52,450
which means you lose range of motion,
which means even when you go to move 

681
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:54,200
your parts during this part of your life
that you've set aside to move,

682
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,380
which is different than the rest of your
life that you've set aside to not move.

683
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,810
You're moving less,
you're moving less of you.

684
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:02,630
So that's,
that's always a huge one.

685
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:07,660
Like what if I told you your whole body 
would work better if you fix what you 

686
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:10,691
were putting on your feet everyday,
you're just going to put shoes on any 

687
00:33:10,691 --> 00:33:10,850
way,
like what does it matter what they are?

688
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:16,510
If you could put on a pair of shoes that
allowed your whole body to function in a

689
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:19,190
different way,
it would be the equivalent to saying,

690
00:33:19,191 --> 00:33:21,560
I got this new workout,
like this new cross training piece.

691
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:26,540
Your workout is stale,
you're not as strong as you should be,

692
00:33:26,541 --> 00:33:29,240
or that you'd like to be.
For the thing that you're doing that you

693
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:34,241
can introduce whole new load spectrum to
your body just by changing your shoes 

694
00:33:34,241 --> 00:33:35,360
would have.
What do you think about those?

695
00:33:35,361 --> 00:33:36,580
What are they called?
Mbts?

696
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,050
Is that what it was called?
The barefoot technology.

697
00:33:39,051 --> 00:33:41,080
The rocker bottom ones.
What are the.

698
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,860
What's the deal with those?
Those stupid.

699
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,290
Well,
there are a rocking chair for your feet,

700
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:50,291
so if you want it,
like if you ever sit down in a rocking 

701
00:33:50,291 --> 00:33:52,541
chair,
that's called momentum and that's not 

702
00:33:52,541 --> 00:33:53,780
something you want in your gait pattern.
You don't want your shoes to be throwing

703
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:56,630
you forwards that you don't have to 
expend as much energy to do it,

704
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:03,180
that you balance yourself constantly on 
those things and in doing that you're 

705
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,790
using all those little muscle groups.
Is that all bs?

706
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:07,940
I don't know if it's all BS.
It's just.

707
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:11,000
It doesn't get.
Its mostly bs.

708
00:34:11,001 --> 00:34:13,630
Mbs isn't there?
Almost called MTS mpt.

709
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,770
It's just this bigger like I don't know.
I always think a lot larger than that.

710
00:34:18,771 --> 00:34:21,380
I'm thinking about like there is a 
cellular environment,

711
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:26,410
there is a nutritious movement,
like it's the equivalent to nutritious 

712
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:32,050
food is that there is a way to move that
as nutritious to your body and you're 

713
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:35,360
missing some huge nutrients so you 
should wear flat shoes all the time.

714
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,350
Flexible,
flexible.

715
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,350
There's a little bit of a bottom to 
that.

716
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:43,910
There's more on the.
If you grab him,

717
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,670
if he grabbed them and bend them over,
what do they do?

718
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:52,190
Like here's my shoes,
flip flops.

719
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,350
That's it.
Yeah,

720
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:58,420
but also,
but decidedly not flip flops because if 

721
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:58,420
you put,
if it's just flip flops then you have to

722
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:03,281
grab to hold them and then you've got 
all this tension and your foot and your 

723
00:35:03,281 --> 00:35:04,280
gait patterns all messed up from,
from natural,

724
00:35:04,281 --> 00:35:09,281
just to hold on the thing on your foot.
So it's kind of like your,

725
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,810
your movement is very reflexive,
you know,

726
00:35:11,811 --> 00:35:16,811
you are an animal,
you're a primate and in your movements 

727
00:35:16,811 --> 00:35:18,890
should be much more reflective than it's
happening right now.

728
00:35:18,891 --> 00:35:23,891
And in one of the reasons that makes it 
so difficult is because of all of these 

729
00:35:23,891 --> 00:35:24,000
casts,
these,

730
00:35:24,001 --> 00:35:29,001
these things that we put on everything.
It's fascinating that you refer to like 

731
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:30,410
a cast for your eyes because I never 
thought about it that way,

732
00:35:30,411 --> 00:35:31,490
but as soon as you said,
I was like,

733
00:35:31,491 --> 00:35:32,870
oh,
that totally makes sense.

734
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:35,010
Like your house is kind of a cast is a 
cast,

735
00:35:35,011 --> 00:35:38,370
the cast being in a work environment,
an office as a cast,

736
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,590
not looking at things for large 
distances.

737
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,670
That is a cast.
Um,

738
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:45,030
the,
the shoe thing I wear converse all stars

739
00:35:45,031 --> 00:35:50,031
most of the time because of that,
because they're flat and they're really 

740
00:35:50,031 --> 00:35:50,031
flexible and light.
Those are okay.

741
00:35:50,031 --> 00:35:50,031
Those,
those would be helpful.

742
00:35:50,031 --> 00:35:53,590
Can you spread your toes out wide but 
then there's this whole other level.

743
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:59,080
Why is that important?
There's muscles in their 25 percent of 

744
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,470
the number in your muscles.
In your body or from your ankle down.

745
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:02,990
Maybe you.
Maybe not me.

746
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:04,370
No,
you might have more muscles.

747
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:07,100
Not Muscle mass.
Muscle mass.

748
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:10,230
I'm just talking shit.
What about those toe shoes?

749
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:11,950
Toe Shoes.
I liked the toe shoes.

750
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:14,380
You get a little bit more for that,
but you have to,

751
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:18,250
you have to transition pretty hard.
It's like you've been wearing cast,

752
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:23,280
like if you broke your arm you wouldn't 
cut it off and then start doing 

753
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,970
cartwheels and stuff.
Why do all my workouts barefoot?

754
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:26,310
That's great.

755
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,400
I do all my weightlifting barefoot.
All my martial arts stuff is off course 

756
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:31,400
barefoot.
But uh,

757
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:35,910
like sometimes I'll take pictures of a 
gym workouts and like,

758
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,140
what are you doing barefoot?
Man,

759
00:36:37,141 --> 00:36:38,610
you crazy going to drop things on your 
feet.

760
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:39,720
I guess what,
man,

761
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,570
you drop things in your feet normally 
you're fucked anyway.

762
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:45,240
If you're lifting 400 pounds,
if you have shoes on,

763
00:36:45,241 --> 00:36:47,050
you're still fucked.
It's gonna.

764
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:49,440
Smush your toes.
Just don't drop things on your feet.

765
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:54,441
Dummy.
How often do you drop things on your 

766
00:36:54,441 --> 00:36:54,441
feet?
I don't drop things on my feet.

767
00:36:54,441 --> 00:36:54,441
I pay attention.

768
00:36:54,441 --> 00:36:54,441
Well,
that's the thing.

769
00:36:54,441 --> 00:36:54,630
If,
if,

770
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:58,480
if you go barefoot,
you learn how to pay a lot of attention.

771
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,370
Yeah,
little kids,

772
00:36:59,371 --> 00:37:04,371
man.
My Kid's stomped on my feet all the 

773
00:37:04,371 --> 00:37:05,991
time.
I'm barefoot around the house and they 

774
00:37:05,991 --> 00:37:05,991
love it.
They think it's funny,

775
00:37:05,991 --> 00:37:10,870
but I'm.
While I'm teaching my six year old 

776
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,591
daughter a teacher,
kickboxing and so now she thinks it's 

777
00:37:12,591 --> 00:37:15,840
funny to just run up on me and leg 
kicked me and it's starting to get hard.

778
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:19,380
Like she's six and she's.
She knows how to whip her body into it.

779
00:37:19,381 --> 00:37:24,381
Now she's a little athlete.
She knows how to turn your hips because 

780
00:37:24,381 --> 00:37:24,720
I've taught her like how to really 
generate force.

781
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:29,870
So the other day she came up to me and 
she did this like perfect pivot and 

782
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:30,840
whack and just dug one right into my 
calf.

783
00:37:30,841 --> 00:37:32,220
I was like,
oh,

784
00:37:32,221 --> 00:37:34,560
you little fucker.
Like it was good.

785
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,350
It was good.
I was proud of how it's pretty good.

786
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,830
But I didn't see it coming.

787
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:38,730
You know,
they just,

788
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,880
they,
well when there's six they feel like 

789
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,951
you're invulnerable.
So they just tee off on you whenever 

790
00:37:45,951 --> 00:37:45,951
they want,
you know,

791
00:37:45,951 --> 00:37:49,790
we can't let them know.
But I mean it doesn't really hurt yet 

792
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:54,110
but it's like,
hey you gotta we've got about four more 

793
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:54,110
years of that before we're going to have
an issue.

794
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:56,730
When she gets to like 13,
14,

795
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:59,340
you could really hurt somebody.
So don't only do it to me.

796
00:37:59,341 --> 00:38:04,341
We have like rules in our house.
We're only allowed to hit daddy and you 

797
00:38:04,341 --> 00:38:07,190
know,
he can't hit each other but you could 

798
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:07,190
hit daddy.
And so we,

799
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:09,870
we play just by.
I just feel like the best way to teach 

800
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:10,830
the martial arts is to show them the 
techniques,

801
00:38:10,831 --> 00:38:15,831
but then actually have them hit a person
because you can hit punching bags and 

802
00:38:15,831 --> 00:38:19,491
stuff all you want,
but I want them to like specifically 

803
00:38:19,491 --> 00:38:19,800
target areas like this is the area 
supposed to hit I.

804
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,300
This is why you're supposed to hit this 
area.

805
00:38:21,301 --> 00:38:25,620
So I let him hit me like a lot of 
barefoot stuff.

806
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,280
Point is.

807
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:27,770
Yeah,
and a lot of people don't.

808
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:30,620
Don't do anything barefoot.
So if you're doing,

809
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,120
you know the bulk of your movement with 
barefoot,

810
00:38:32,121 --> 00:38:37,121
that's great,
but you could also do your podcast 

811
00:38:37,121 --> 00:38:37,121
barefoot.
Really?

812
00:38:37,121 --> 00:38:37,121
Why would that help?

813
00:38:37,121 --> 00:38:39,700
Why does it help your workout?
But I'm moving my feet around.

814
00:38:39,701 --> 00:38:44,701
I'm sitting here will move around.
I would suggest that you move around 

815
00:38:44,701 --> 00:38:46,180
more to like wiggle my toes around.
People are weird.

816
00:38:46,181 --> 00:38:49,000
They're sitting around barefoot somehow 
or another would with girls.

817
00:38:49,001 --> 00:38:54,001
It doesn't bother me,
but like if I'm sitting like Eddie 

818
00:38:54,001 --> 00:38:54,001
Bravo,
I love Eddie.

819
00:38:54,001 --> 00:38:55,930
Bravo two dads is a good buddy of mine.
That dude's always barefoot.

820
00:38:55,931 --> 00:38:57,610
It was playing with his feet and stuff 
like,

821
00:38:57,611 --> 00:38:58,240
come on,
man,

822
00:38:58,241 --> 00:39:02,390
puts his feet up on tables in a 
restaurant and just.

823
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:04,210
He's always stretching.
He's super.

824
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,190
He's a Jujitsu master,
so he was always like,

825
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:09,510
got one foot here and one foot here is 
always pushing his weight down,

826
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,470
stretching himself.
He's always barefoot.

827
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,490
That's why he's a master maybe.
Yeah.

828
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,660
Wow.
Was that the 10,000

829
00:39:16,661 --> 00:39:18,020
hours thing?
You know,

830
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:21,400
it's got a lot of years of choking 
people and thinking about it too,

831
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:24,640
but the.
He's always barefoot like so.

832
00:39:24,641 --> 00:39:26,800
There's probably something to that and 
he lifts weights,

833
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:30,130
will converse all stars of the gym.
They don't let you lift weights at a gym

834
00:39:30,131 --> 00:39:31,540
gym most of the time,
barefoot,

835
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:37,410
but those toe shoes didn't.
Wasn't really a class action lawsuit 

836
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:37,410
that said those toe shoes were bullshit.

837
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:41,620
No.
The class action lawsuit was that the 

838
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,760
woman who brought about the class action
said that the advertising imply that all

839
00:39:43,761 --> 00:39:46,310
you had to do was buy the shoes that you
didn't.

840
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,670
You didn't have to figure out how to use
your body differently,

841
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:54,500
so it had nothing to do with how they.
How they performed it was about their,

842
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:59,590
their claim,
so the way she interpreted it was that 

843
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:02,531
she just had to put them on her feet and
that she would be healthier and have 

844
00:40:02,531 --> 00:40:02,980
less injuries.
Marika,

845
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:04,390
let's

846
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:05,760
mark.
Yeah,

847
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,460
Jesus Christ.
These class action lawsuits,

848
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:10,960
some of them are just so God damn goofy.
You let go.

849
00:40:10,961 --> 00:40:12,100
Come on.
Really.

850
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,520
You thought you could put shoes on and 
you would become a super person.

851
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:16,990
Might have.
It's true though,

852
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:22,890
but that's the real issue.
If they do one day come up with 

853
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:23,860
something that you just put it on and 
makes you a way better athlete.

854
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:26,290
Like then what's the point of being?
Yeah,

855
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,110
it's like steroid shoes,
you know,

856
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,890
like all of a sudden people are running 
faster.

857
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:32,470
She didn't that um,
the,

858
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:35,800
the South African guy who shot his 
girlfriend the,

859
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:38,650
what's his name?
The guy with the blades.

860
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:40,810
Pistorius.
Yeah.

861
00:40:40,811 --> 00:40:42,850
That guy.
Those blades,

862
00:40:42,851 --> 00:40:47,851
like a lot of people feel like they can,
you can actually run faster with those 

863
00:40:47,851 --> 00:40:51,601
things on because they offer some sort 
of a spring that you could with just 

864
00:40:51,601 --> 00:40:51,750
your regular feet.

865
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,510
So they get to that with shoes.
Then we've got an issue.

866
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,570
People,
do you think people will be taking their

867
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:01,060
own feet off just to get those too?
When we've actually discussed that,

868
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,610
what we've discussed is not for those 
blades,

869
00:41:03,611 --> 00:41:06,400
but there's gonna come a time where 
there was a guy that we,

870
00:41:06,401 --> 00:41:11,401
um,
we talked about on the podcast once he 

871
00:41:11,401 --> 00:41:14,281
had gotten his leg and his arm bitten 
off by a shark and he had replaced them 

872
00:41:14,281 --> 00:41:19,230
with these really high tech replacement 
hands that articulate and his,

873
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:24,640
his leg was perfectly suited to his body
and he walked around with no limp.

874
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:29,970
It was so strange and you see the guys 
there talking and he's having a 

875
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:30,700
conversation and talking about that and 
he's using his,

876
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:35,780
his,
his artificial hand and his real to 

877
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:35,780
gesture and like,
well,

878
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:40,740
what,
what they're going to get better at 

879
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:40,740
those.

880
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:43,030
Like the old days it was like I went to 
school with this girl and she lost her 

881
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:43,880
arm like really early on in life.
And it was always,

882
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:45,630
you know,
everybody was always weirded out by it.

883
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,300
She had a hook.
It's a very nice girl,

884
00:41:47,301 --> 00:41:52,301
but she was like,
if she had like this artificial hand 

885
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:54,590
that looked exactly like a real hand is 
just a different color.

886
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:56,450
Well,
what,

887
00:41:56,510 --> 00:42:01,510
how much different would people react to
her then a decade later if she has an 

888
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:05,681
artificial hand that has some sort of an
artificial skin component to it that 

889
00:42:05,681 --> 00:42:09,161
actually has sensitivity built into it,
that it interacts with her nerves that 

890
00:42:09,161 --> 00:42:09,410
allows.
I mean,

891
00:42:09,411 --> 00:42:13,100
they have some that allow you to pick up
pieces of glass and not break them.

892
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:14,720
I mean they have like,
really?

893
00:42:14,721 --> 00:42:16,670
They,
they allow you to feel pressure,

894
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:21,850
like really sensitive one.
So they're developing one day they're 

895
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:23,090
going to get one that's better than your
actual legs.

896
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:26,980
So if you had these regular legs,
we can give you an operation and uh,

897
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:31,990
it'll make you run like Hussein bolt.
You're going to have some artificial 

898
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:31,990
legs,
you know,

899
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:32,570
it's going to,
going to go through a rehab process.

900
00:42:32,571 --> 00:42:35,120
You won't be able to walk for a couple 
of weeks because we're going to cut your

901
00:42:35,121 --> 00:42:40,121
fucking legs off and stuff.
These carbon fiber jammies in there and 

902
00:42:40,121 --> 00:42:44,470
and put the joint endings in and fuse 
them with this new thing that we've 

903
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:44,470
created.
Yeah,

904
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:45,460
someone's going to do that.
Totally.

905
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:47,390
Absolutely.
It's just a matter of time.

906
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:53,630
Just a matter of time before we have 
artificial bodies into someone's going 

907
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:54,500
to just suck your head right out of your
brain,

908
00:42:54,501 --> 00:42:57,290
right out of your head and stuffing into
this thing and boom,

909
00:42:57,291 --> 00:43:01,380
you're just going to be like piloting 
around this crazy body right now.

910
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:01,640
You think.

911
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:04,850
I absolutely think that that's kind of 
beyond the point though,

912
00:43:04,851 --> 00:43:09,851
right?
Until then we've got to deal with what 

913
00:43:09,851 --> 00:43:09,851
we have.
Well,

914
00:43:09,851 --> 00:43:09,851
yeah.
Well I would say,

915
00:43:09,851 --> 00:43:11,040
I mean I'm,
I'm a biomechanist,

916
00:43:11,041 --> 00:43:16,041
so a lot of the colleagues that I work 
with are in a orthopedic development and

917
00:43:16,131 --> 00:43:18,920
stuff that you're talking about,
so it's kind of my,

918
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:22,280
my territory just to see what people are
coming up with,

919
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:25,340
but the big thing that you can't really 
get around yet is that,

920
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:31,030
that your,
that your parts are doing other parts 

921
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:34,391
and just moving you around.
That's always kind of the limitation of 

922
00:43:34,391 --> 00:43:34,391
like if you,
if you lose a part,

923
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,210
you know that's,
that's the loss and you can replace it,

924
00:43:38,211 --> 00:43:40,370
but to voluntarily take off healthy 
parts,

925
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:43,310
those parts do things other than just be
those parts.

926
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:45,620
They're,
they're participating in the system.

927
00:43:45,621 --> 00:43:50,621
It's like kind of the same thing,
like you can't take an animal out of an 

928
00:43:50,621 --> 00:43:53,951
ecosystem because the,
all the other animals collapse without 

929
00:43:53,951 --> 00:43:55,430
it because they're expanding out of 
control and something else is dying off.

930
00:43:55,431 --> 00:43:56,750
It's the,
it's the same thing.

931
00:43:56,751 --> 00:44:00,410
The parts,
the part has a role as a part,

932
00:44:00,411 --> 00:44:05,411
but it also has a role within the system
and so that'll be the backfiring on 

933
00:44:05,411 --> 00:44:05,411
that.

934
00:44:05,411 --> 00:44:09,100
The balance though,
just like putting an invasive species 

935
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:09,100
into an ecosystem,
screws everything up.

936
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:09,890
There's a balance.

937
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:12,010
There's a relationship between 
everything else.

938
00:44:12,011 --> 00:44:17,011
It took a really long time to establish 
and when you start messing around that 

939
00:44:17,011 --> 00:44:17,560
around,
you're playing clean up like the rest of

940
00:44:17,561 --> 00:44:19,090
your life.

941
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:23,340
Yeah.
Now when you like,

942
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,440
when you think about human movement,
like what?

943
00:44:26,441 --> 00:44:31,441
Besides the shoes that you wear,
what are the other big issues that 

944
00:44:31,441 --> 00:44:32,250
people have and how

945
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:37,250
they,
how they get through this life with 

946
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:37,250
their body?

947
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:40,400
Well,
people don't walk enough like they're 

948
00:44:41,821 --> 00:44:44,190
missing in.
Like there's a whole group of people who

949
00:44:44,191 --> 00:44:49,191
don't eat any fat.
A lot of people don't eat any fat as a 

950
00:44:49,191 --> 00:44:52,731
whole category of a,
a micronutrient and then they're slowly 

951
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:57,381
introducing it back in and they're like,
I had all these health problems because 

952
00:44:57,381 --> 00:45:00,081
I was missing I'm fat.
Or maybe I didn't eat any protein or 

953
00:45:00,081 --> 00:45:00,120
maybe I didn't eat any animal products.
You know,

954
00:45:00,121 --> 00:45:05,121
like they've got these big voids in 
their diet and then there are diseases 

955
00:45:05,121 --> 00:45:08,460
that show up when you have some,
some void like vitamin C,

956
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:12,550
no one even knew you needed vitamin C 
until you have this group of sailors,

957
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:17,570
you know,
in this case population that went 

958
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:17,570
without it.
And it's like,

959
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:17,570
well,
they have that.

960
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:18,090
They had adequate food so it's not 
calories they're missing.

961
00:45:18,091 --> 00:45:21,550
And it took 40 years before someone 
realize it.

962
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:26,560
The vitamin C it's APP.
We've figured out that we can get them 

963
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,840
their connective tissue to stop bleeding
profusely if we give them a oranges or 

964
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:34,551
lemons,
and then it took another 60 or 70 years 

965
00:45:34,551 --> 00:45:34,551
for someone to identify that as vitamin 
C.

966
00:45:34,551 --> 00:45:37,020
it's like it's essential.
Your body can't live without it,

967
00:45:37,021 --> 00:45:40,050
and so,
so walking is really one of those things

968
00:45:40,051 --> 00:45:45,051
that your body can't.
They can't function as it as it should 

969
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:50,450
without it that,
that there are these other byproducts 

970
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:51,870
that go along when you walk in a 
particular way,

971
00:45:51,871 --> 00:45:53,760
so that's where alignment comes in,
that there's this,

972
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:59,210
these series of loads that are created 
by using your body and in walking would 

973
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:03,401
have been the thing that you would be 
doing most often out of out of all the 

974
00:46:03,401 --> 00:46:04,860
moves that your body has done for the 
millennium,

975
00:46:04,861 --> 00:46:09,861
walking is the load maker that you would
do the most and there's people who just 

976
00:46:09,861 --> 00:46:11,430
don't walk at all.
They work out,

977
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,170
they're fit,
they run,

978
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:14,460
they do everything,
but they don't walk.

979
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:15,600
That's huge.

980
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:21,220
So just walking alone,
just important just to to balance out 

981
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:21,440
your body,
just to be a normal,

982
00:46:21,441 --> 00:46:22,220
healthy person.

983
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:23,550
Yeah.
It's a,

984
00:46:23,551 --> 00:46:24,690
it's a,
it's an input,

985
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:26,810
it's an input to your,
to your body slam.

986
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,370
We don't think of movement as an input,
but it's a squash,

987
00:46:29,371 --> 00:46:34,371
like your cells are squashed by the way 
that you move and then then the way that

988
00:46:34,891 --> 00:46:36,990
the cells expressed themselves,
they're kind of,

989
00:46:36,991 --> 00:46:41,991
their genetic expression is,
is comes about by the mechanical 

990
00:46:41,991 --> 00:46:43,590
environment is one of the important 
environments.

991
00:46:43,591 --> 00:46:48,591
And,
and right now for a lot of people it's 

992
00:46:48,591 --> 00:46:48,591
walking free.
So just walking,

993
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:51,990
it doesn't really have any purpose in 
our life any longer because you don't,

994
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,620
you don't have to walk anywhere to get 
anything done.

995
00:46:55,621 --> 00:46:57,840
But,
but like this Orca Fin,

996
00:46:57,841 --> 00:46:59,160
you know,
the way,

997
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:03,000
the way that an Orca swims in the wild 
is what maintains its structure.

998
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:05,610
There's nothing that the Orca can do now
with this flopped over fin.

999
00:47:05,611 --> 00:47:08,490
It can't,
it can't do opposing fin curls.

1000
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:10,980
It can't foam roller out the floppy 
side.

1001
00:47:10,981 --> 00:47:13,710
The structure has been set by the fact 
that swims in a circle.

1002
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,320
So it softens all,
all,

1003
00:47:16,321 --> 00:47:20,460
uh,
fins soften as the worker goes from it's

1004
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:23,040
juvenile through its teenager to 
adulthood.

1005
00:47:23,041 --> 00:47:28,041
But coupled package with that is 
swimming in a particular way at depths 

1006
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:32,290
where the forces are such that it 
maintains and shapes this structure,

1007
00:47:32,291 --> 00:47:35,890
this end result that we call an Orca.
So we're,

1008
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:40,750
we are swimming metaphorically,
just counterclockwise all of the time.

1009
00:47:40,751 --> 00:47:45,751
And so our structure,
our definition of fit and healthy is 

1010
00:47:45,751 --> 00:47:48,760
like the peak of that.
This orca with the flopped over fin,

1011
00:47:48,761 --> 00:47:51,220
whatever.
Get swimming in a circle at seaworld and

1012
00:47:51,221 --> 00:47:56,221
you can see the vast difference between 
any possible swimming program he can be 

1013
00:47:56,221 --> 00:47:58,750
put on there compared to how he would 
swim in the ocean,

1014
00:47:58,751 --> 00:48:03,751
getting food every day,
which is like 100 miles of swimming 

1015
00:48:03,751 --> 00:48:06,421
every day.
Fast sprints when they have to get 

1016
00:48:06,421 --> 00:48:06,421
something,
you know,

1017
00:48:06,421 --> 00:48:07,540
there's,
there's mating their social time,

1018
00:48:07,541 --> 00:48:12,220
there's all these things that go on in 
the wild that is the necessary input for

1019
00:48:12,221 --> 00:48:13,840
being an Orca.
And then you just say,

1020
00:48:13,841 --> 00:48:16,780
well then what,
what necessary inputs are we missing?

1021
00:48:16,781 --> 00:48:21,781
Kind of is as humans because so much of 
our physiology depends on how we move 

1022
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:23,800
and how we don't.

1023
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:25,180
So,
uh,

1024
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:29,960
to use an analogy that you used earlier,
like the Orca in that pool is kind of in

1025
00:48:29,961 --> 00:48:31,340
a cast,
correct?

1026
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:35,420
Because the atrophy of lawyer,
I had my arm broke once and I had a cast

1027
00:48:35,421 --> 00:48:40,421
when I took my arm out of the cast,
it was like this little shriveled up 

1028
00:48:40,421 --> 00:48:40,421
thing,
you know,

1029
00:48:40,421 --> 00:48:41,420
and everybody knows that when you don't 
use your muscles,

1030
00:48:41,421 --> 00:48:42,370
they just decide,
oh,

1031
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:44,750
we don't need these and they shrink 
down.

1032
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:48,210
And so that's what's happening to this,
this poor things thin

1033
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:49,230
and,
and everyone that,

1034
00:48:49,231 --> 00:48:54,231
you know,
even even people that you know who have 

1035
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:56,511
a ton of muscle mass,
it's just compare the distribution of 

1036
00:48:56,511 --> 00:49:00,921
muscle mass that you see is just 
compared to people who don't do those 

1037
00:49:00,921 --> 00:49:02,190
particular things that you do to get 
that muscle mass.

1038
00:49:02,191 --> 00:49:07,191
But there is a whole other mass 
distribution that would come about were 

1039
00:49:07,591 --> 00:49:09,600
you to do other things.
And so I'm,

1040
00:49:09,601 --> 00:49:12,810
I'm mostly concerned with disease.
What I,

1041
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:15,160
what I work on most are human diseases 
and,

1042
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,600
and basic human functions.
What I'm most interested in is,

1043
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:20,280
um,
she'll like,

1044
00:49:20,281 --> 00:49:21,660
uh,
getting pregnant,

1045
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:25,430
maintaining your delivery and then 
delivering this child like that.

1046
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:28,860
We're having some serious fertility and 
delivery problems,

1047
00:49:28,861 --> 00:49:29,820
which are,
you know,

1048
00:49:29,821 --> 00:49:32,940
like the level one for a species,
like the survival of a species is like,

1049
00:49:32,941 --> 00:49:37,941
what do you mean people can't get 
pregnant or they can't birth third 

1050
00:49:37,941 --> 00:49:41,720
children anymore.
Like they need special equipment and 

1051
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,031
medical intervention.
Like these are big signs for a species 

1052
00:49:44,031 --> 00:49:44,100
that it.
Same thing happens in zoos,

1053
00:49:44,101 --> 00:49:49,101
right?
Like animals don't breed well in zoos 

1054
00:49:49,101 --> 00:49:51,831
because they are missing things.
And so it's the same thing that we're 

1055
00:49:51,831 --> 00:49:51,831
experienced.

1056
00:49:51,831 --> 00:49:55,180
That's an interesting way of putting it.
Animals don't breed well in zoos because

1057
00:49:55,181 --> 00:50:00,181
they're missing.
Their environment has been radically 

1058
00:50:00,181 --> 00:50:00,181
changed.
And that's the same thing with people.

1059
00:50:00,181 --> 00:50:05,180
Well,
they're supposed to be interacting with 

1060
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:05,180
other animals.
I mean like there's so much.

1061
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:05,400
There's isolation,
not,

1062
00:50:05,401 --> 00:50:10,401
not just the animal itself from its herd
or it's try,

1063
00:50:10,651 --> 00:50:12,390
but then from other animals.
Again,

1064
00:50:12,391 --> 00:50:17,391
this is a big system and in zoo research
is really interesting because it's 

1065
00:50:17,391 --> 00:50:21,411
covering everything.
Like what happens when you put a zoo in 

1066
00:50:21,411 --> 00:50:21,411
a city,
you know,

1067
00:50:21,411 --> 00:50:21,411
and,
and,

1068
00:50:21,411 --> 00:50:25,961
and have light,
you've got light going on all of the 

1069
00:50:25,961 --> 00:50:25,961
time.
So,

1070
00:50:25,961 --> 00:50:25,961
um,
there's,

1071
00:50:25,961 --> 00:50:28,460
there's constant what they call night 
lighting,

1072
00:50:28,461 --> 00:50:30,260
so light beyond this,
the sun.

1073
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:33,560
And then there's metal noises,
the loud clanging.

1074
00:50:33,561 --> 00:50:37,130
Plus there's all these biological cues 
that if you ever go camping,

1075
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:38,600
you know,
you hear the bugs,

1076
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:43,750
the bugs let you know the birds let you 
know where everything else is in that 

1077
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:47,450
there are cultures who understand who,
who have this input of,

1078
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:52,400
of noise.
And from a scientific perspective,

1079
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:53,750
you know,
there's like these things.

1080
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:58,460
All of the data that we have on humans 
really comes from the last,

1081
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,890
oh,
maybe like 60 to 100 years.

1082
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:03,530
And so there's like these basic in 
psychology tests,

1083
00:51:03,531 --> 00:51:05,480
like you've probably seen them where 
they've got the arrows,

1084
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:08,300
the outset arrows pointed outward on the
tips.

1085
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:10,410
And then on the other tip of the other 
early point in words,

1086
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:13,850
which line is longer,
it's kind of an optical illusion and you

1087
00:51:13,851 --> 00:51:18,851
get it wrong.
Like everyone says that the arrows that 

1088
00:51:18,851 --> 00:51:18,851
point in his longer or whatever,
and it was like,

1089
00:51:18,851 --> 00:51:21,680
so this is how the human brain works and
there's all this data like that.

1090
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:27,190
Only it turns out if you take that test 
to a culture that actually needs to 

1091
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:29,930
judge distance for survival,
they don't have a problem seeing.

1092
00:51:29,931 --> 00:51:34,220
It's not an optical illusion to them.
It's just poor skill when we look at it.

1093
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:39,580
So there are all of these hypotheses on 
humans are studying college aged humans 

1094
00:51:42,201 --> 00:51:44,150
like you're.
You're looking at orcas with floppy,

1095
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:49,390
floppy fins and then are just making all
these judgments on whales and so I'm at 

1096
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:53,270
with this realization that so much of 
our,

1097
00:51:53,271 --> 00:51:56,600
like your human physiology textbook,
that's not human physiology,

1098
00:51:56,810 --> 00:51:59,180
that shape that you're looking at have a
skeleton that's,

1099
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:04,550
that's modern guy who's worn shoes his 
whole life and walked on flat and level,

1100
00:52:04,551 --> 00:52:06,260
flat and level ground.
That's another cast.

1101
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:11,410
You're not supposed to walk like flat 
and level is the most weird abnormal 

1102
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:16,150
texture for you to ever walk on,
and yet you've probably only walked on 

1103
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:17,060
flat and level for like 99 percent of 
your life.

1104
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:22,090
Your ankle joint has a different shape 
than someone who has walked in the 

1105
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:26,951
wilderness their whole entire life 
because they use more parts just to get 

1106
00:52:26,951 --> 00:52:26,951
walking done.
Use almost nothing to walk.

1107
00:52:26,951 --> 00:52:28,340
Walking is falling.
Like that's our.

1108
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:33,760
That's our saying is sure.
For someone who sits in the chair most 

1109
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:34,130
of the time and walks on flat and level 
in shoes that's falling.

1110
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:37,010
Some people have an incredibly difficult
time going up hills.

1111
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:40,220
Sure.
The different muscles and different.

1112
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:46,170
One of the first times I went hunting,
I went hunting in Montana and we were 

1113
00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:50,311
climbing up these hills.
That's used to be the great western 

1114
00:52:50,311 --> 00:52:50,830
inland sea near,
uh,

1115
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:55,890
it's the Missouri breaks.
And so it's this weird clay like 

1116
00:52:55,890 --> 00:52:59,850
material that covers all the ground and 
when you're walking up hill you're 

1117
00:52:59,850 --> 00:53:03,190
sliding a lot down and everything is 
kind of slippery.

1118
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:08,310
So everywhere you're going,
you're constantly counterbalancing and 

1119
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:10,831
catching yourself.
And it's not like us and you get 

1120
00:53:10,831 --> 00:53:10,870
exhausted like you think you're in 
shape.

1121
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:14,980
Like you could do all kinds of crazy 
workouts and crossfit your brains out,

1122
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:20,190
but then you go up these hills all day 
and you're fucking tired and by the end 

1123
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:24,840
of the day you're starving.
You have this weird hunger for animal 

1124
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:28,921
protein to for animal protein and fat,
like fatty things and even pasta or any 

1125
00:53:29,701 --> 00:53:34,701
like high calorie things like this 
intense craving for because your body's 

1126
00:53:34,701 --> 00:53:37,500
just doing all this breaking down of 
tissue all day long.

1127
00:53:37,501 --> 00:53:41,160
You're stressing your body in a weird 
way that you just don't get.

1128
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:42,450
Like walking around the city

1129
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:45,000
we've gotten.
We've gotten rid of everything.

1130
00:53:45,001 --> 00:53:50,001
Anything.
The only variable that we have left to 

1131
00:53:50,001 --> 00:53:50,950
play with his intensity.
Like it's like,

1132
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:52,920
well I'm walking on this.
I'll have to go faster.

1133
00:53:52,921 --> 00:53:57,921
I'll have to go harder because that's 
the only thing that's left to respond to

1134
00:53:58,351 --> 00:54:03,351
it.
Like that's the thing with casts is if 

1135
00:54:03,351 --> 00:54:04,881
you've.
If you've removed any other movement 

1136
00:54:04,881 --> 00:54:08,841
that would allow you to do any sort of 
cross training or use new parts in 

1137
00:54:08,841 --> 00:54:10,740
different ways than all you have left to
do is the same thing harder or faster,

1138
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:16,130
but yeah,
texture for people who study the human 

1139
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:19,611
kinetic chain,
like things like walking and like the 

1140
00:54:19,611 --> 00:54:21,510
foot skin like you're going up hills and
shoes probably,

1141
00:54:21,511 --> 00:54:23,910
but if you.
If you didn't have shoes on,

1142
00:54:23,911 --> 00:54:27,000
that first level of of traction would be
at the skin,

1143
00:54:27,001 --> 00:54:32,001
which means your skin has to be strong 
enough to carry the load of your body 

1144
00:54:32,001 --> 00:54:33,460
here hands,
you know,

1145
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:35,580
people do a ton of work with their upper
body,

1146
00:54:35,581 --> 00:54:40,581
but they won't actually bring the hand 
skin along to the strength of the rest 

1147
00:54:40,581 --> 00:54:41,670
of their body because everything's a 
bar,

1148
00:54:41,671 --> 00:54:46,671
right?
It's like this flat uniform level never 

1149
00:54:46,671 --> 00:54:49,491
occur in nature bar as opposed to 
picking up things with texture and each 

1150
00:54:49,491 --> 00:54:52,801
other's texture.
That kind of bite in the skin and then 

1151
00:54:52,801 --> 00:54:53,700
your skin strengthens and then your arms
are stronger because.

1152
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:59,540
Because that first level of caring or 
picking up or hauling out or doing 

1153
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:01,860
anything is traction.
Traction between you and the earth,

1154
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:03,390
human and the earth.
Animal on earth,

1155
00:55:03,391 --> 00:55:04,470
whether it's a hand or foot.

1156
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:09,870
Yeah.
One thing I've never understood is I 

1157
00:55:09,870 --> 00:55:09,870
understand it,
but I've never done it.

1158
00:55:09,870 --> 00:55:14,220
I've never agreed with it is guys who 
put risk traps on and do all these 

1159
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:17,071
exercises.
So you're carrying weight that your 

1160
00:55:17,071 --> 00:55:20,071
hands can support,
but you're kind of doing your body a 

1161
00:55:20,071 --> 00:55:21,190
disservice or you're overloading your 
joint 20 doing that,

1162
00:55:21,191 --> 00:55:21,460
aren't you?

1163
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:22,190
Yeah.
Um,

1164
00:55:22,770 --> 00:55:27,770
because what's happening is they can't 
get any stronger to carry that because 

1165
00:55:27,770 --> 00:55:28,230
it's,
again,

1166
00:55:28,231 --> 00:55:31,560
it's this limited flat and round thing 
like,

1167
00:55:31,561 --> 00:55:36,561
you know,
you can pick up your kettlebell or 

1168
00:55:36,561 --> 00:55:36,561
whatever,
but as it's getting heavier,

1169
00:55:36,561 --> 00:55:37,410
it's the same handle.
So there's,

1170
00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:42,810
there's parts of you that are left out 
of getting stronger because the 

1171
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:46,110
environment is repetitive.
So if you go out and hang from a tree,

1172
00:55:46,111 --> 00:55:49,860
if you were holding onto something that 
kind of fit in a little bit,

1173
00:55:49,861 --> 00:55:54,861
then you would be able to carry with 
your hands whatever you were also able 

1174
00:55:54,861 --> 00:55:59,391
to carry with for the rest of the body.
There's got to be some sort of cross 

1175
00:55:59,391 --> 00:55:59,391
training for the hands.
It can't just be that same

1176
00:55:59,391 --> 00:56:04,210
thanks.
So instead of just gripping like this 

1177
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:06,131
all the time,
you should do some stuff like this and 

1178
00:56:06,131 --> 00:56:06,131
you should pull things and you should 
be.

1179
00:56:06,131 --> 00:56:08,450
And texture.
Texture is,

1180
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:13,870
it's not musculoskeletal,
it has nothing to do with the amount 

1181
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:13,870
your joints flex,
so.

1182
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:16,350
So girth of a bar is one thing,
you know,

1183
00:56:16,351 --> 00:56:18,410
the size and the shape of the bar and 
the angle.

1184
00:56:18,411 --> 00:56:20,480
That's one way of cross training the 
hands,

1185
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,980
but there's also the skin,
like your skin just not

1186
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:28,980
strong enough because the things that 
you are exercising with are these kind 

1187
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:32,010
of smooth man made fake things are not 
anything that you would actually like.

1188
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:33,490
This is the weight of a log.
It's like great.

1189
00:56:33,491 --> 00:56:35,790
Go pick up a log to.
We should pick up long.

1190
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:37,720
You should pick up logs,
pickup some,

1191
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:41,050
some rocks or something.
Or at least hall yourself up in a tree.

1192
00:56:41,051 --> 00:56:42,970
Every now and then instead of on a chin 
up bar,

1193
00:56:42,971 --> 00:56:43,660
like in a gym.

1194
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:47,130
Hm.
We need trees to climb up,

1195
00:56:47,131 --> 00:56:48,810
but if you fall down from the tree,
you're fucked.

1196
00:56:49,330 --> 00:56:50,350
Yeah.
Or are you.

1197
00:56:50,351 --> 00:56:52,390
I don't know,
maybe you've never really loaded.

1198
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:57,840
Like I said,
the other thing would walls you're 

1199
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:57,840
fucked if you fall from a tree.
Well,

1200
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:58,660
the same thing about,
you know,

1201
00:56:58,661 --> 00:57:01,450
dropping something on your foot.
You become a little bit more mindful.

1202
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:02,800
You become more mindful.

1203
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:08,060
My friend Cameron does this work out.
I think he does it once a week where he 

1204
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:12,500
takes a rock that's 135 pound rock and 
he carries it up to the top of a 

1205
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,700
mountain and he doesn't want it two 
ways.

1206
00:57:14,701 --> 00:57:16,950
Like sometimes he throws it in his 
backpack.

1207
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:22,040
He has like one of those,
a big oversized tenzing backpacks,

1208
00:57:22,321 --> 00:57:27,321
like with all the straps on it that you 
would use for like carrying game out of 

1209
00:57:27,321 --> 00:57:27,321
the woods.
He's a big l connor.

1210
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:30,090
And to train his body to carry heavy 
loads,

1211
00:57:30,091 --> 00:57:35,091
he just takes us 135 pound rock throws 
in his backpack and goes up hills or 

1212
00:57:35,091 --> 00:57:39,470
sometimes he just picks this rock up and
puts it on his shoulder and goes up 

1213
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:42,591
hills and just rotate shoulders and I 
think in his eyes like anything you do 

1214
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:49,760
that's unusual or difficult and training
your body and training it in some way 

1215
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:53,961
that's going to sort of mimic what he's 
going to have to do if he's hunting and 

1216
00:57:53,961 --> 00:57:55,350
carrying an elk out of the forest.
It's like similar to that.

1217
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:55,500
Yeah,

1218
00:57:55,570 --> 00:58:00,570
six law of specificity.
You want to get to it as close as 

1219
00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:00,570
possible,

1220
00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:03,780
but he's also still carrying this 
awkward weight and doing things in a way

1221
00:58:03,781 --> 00:58:05,760
that makes you your body like 
compensate.

1222
00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:07,200
But that's.
But see,

1223
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:10,110
that's the thing with posture,
why it's a modern construct.

1224
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:15,111
Like to say that there's a safe way to 
carry a rock really means that if I'm 

1225
00:58:15,181 --> 00:58:18,660
only doing this one thing and then 
sitting down the rest of the time,

1226
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:23,661
that the only way that my whole body's 
going to be trained is if I do my 

1227
00:58:23,661 --> 00:58:26,340
training time symmetrically.
If you were just moving all the time,

1228
00:58:26,341 --> 00:58:28,320
kind of a nature,
you would balance out and actually.

1229
00:58:28,321 --> 00:58:33,321
Because you'd never encouraged.
You never encounter the same load twice 

1230
00:58:33,321 --> 00:58:33,660
really.
So I have kids,

1231
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:36,600
I have a two year old and a three old.
We've never had a stroller.

1232
00:58:36,810 --> 00:58:41,310
We've carried those 30 and 40 pounders 
exclusively miles.

1233
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:44,100
And so that was,
that was our big thing.

1234
00:58:44,101 --> 00:58:44,490
Right.
You know,

1235
00:58:44,491 --> 00:58:45,640
so everyone's like,
you're,

1236
00:58:45,810 --> 00:58:50,810
when you have kids,
a lot of times your workout changes 

1237
00:58:50,810 --> 00:58:50,810
because there's just no more time 
anymore.

1238
00:58:50,810 --> 00:58:55,550
It's like,
well you carry them and then they're 

1239
00:58:55,550 --> 00:58:58,310
dynamic and they're moving,
which means it's not like it's not 

1240
00:58:58,310 --> 00:59:00,630
holding a 30 or 40 pound ball,
right.

1241
00:59:00,631 --> 00:59:05,631
It's,
it's a different load because there for 

1242
00:59:05,631 --> 00:59:07,940
30 and 40 pounds is distributed at their
whim based on what they want to look at 

1243
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:09,780
and where they want to go and they want 
to go to this site now.

1244
00:59:09,781 --> 00:59:13,560
So they are,
they are strong little shits,

1245
00:59:13,561 --> 00:59:15,690
like they're strong,
they're really strong,

1246
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:18,720
but they've been carrying themselves and
we've been carrying them.

1247
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:20,910
So it's like there's been this 
relationship,

1248
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:23,390
I'm always strong enough to carry them 
five miles.

1249
00:59:23,391 --> 00:59:24,140
No problem.

1250
00:59:24,490 --> 00:59:26,050
Wow.
Five miles,

1251
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:31,000
five miles.
Wow.

1252
00:59:31,490 --> 00:59:34,710
That's very impressive.
Carrying anything that's 30 plus pounds,

1253
00:59:34,711 --> 00:59:37,030
five miles,
but you can't put down when you're like,

1254
00:59:37,050 --> 00:59:38,460
that's the thing.
It's like we've committed,

1255
00:59:38,570 --> 00:59:40,230
we're in the,
we're in the wilderness.

1256
00:59:40,231 --> 00:59:44,700
We will have to come out now.
Like my six year old is awesome.

1257
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:48,870
She pulls full guard on your show,
wrap her legs around you and essentially

1258
00:59:48,871 --> 00:59:50,610
almost carries her homework and that's 
part of it.

1259
00:59:50,611 --> 00:59:55,611
Right?
So since they've never been in a 

1260
00:59:55,611 --> 00:59:57,051
stroller,
they know how to hold on to and they 

1261
00:59:57,051 --> 00:59:59,211
could hold on.
I mean when they were like six or seven 

1262
00:59:59,211 --> 00:59:59,211
months,
they were strong enough to hold on.

1263
00:59:59,211 --> 01:00:00,360
It could hang from their own hand.
Wait,

1264
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:05,390
no problem.
That you had to give them the 

1265
01:00:05,390 --> 01:00:05,390
environment to do that,
which was never put him in anything.

1266
01:00:05,390 --> 01:00:10,040
That's so,
so you like have engineered this in a 

1267
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:10,040
way?
Well I think it was,

1268
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:12,000
it's been around for a really long time.

1269
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,970
But yeah,
like that's like in your own personal.

1270
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:19,020
My own personal life.
I've just a really do everything that I 

1271
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:20,490
recommend.
I've just done myself.

1272
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:23,250
I do it as a workout.
I carry both of them.

1273
01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:25,380
Like when we go places and they get 
tired.

1274
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:29,580
I carry both my kids a six year old and 
the four year old I always team up.

1275
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:32,520
I have an 18 year old but I'm carrying a
six year old,

1276
01:00:32,521 --> 01:00:35,520
the four year old or hoist him up on my 
shoulders and haul them around.

1277
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:38,190
But yeah,
this is a really good workout if you,

1278
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:43,200
you know,
you carry carrying 70 pounds and some 

1279
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:43,200
sort of a weird way,
you know,

1280
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:46,400
you got like 40 on one hand,
30 on the other and you sort of balance 

1281
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,310
and amount,
but it balances out over time.

1282
01:00:47,311 --> 01:00:48,600
I mean,
I guess that's a thing with,

1283
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:50,850
with loads the body,
they should balance out over time.

1284
01:00:50,851 --> 01:00:52,950
They don't always have to balance out 
over an hour.

1285
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:55,640
I found out something recently that 
disturbed me.

1286
01:00:56,870 --> 01:01:01,870
I always throw my backpack,
I throw it over my right shoulder like 

1287
01:01:03,351 --> 01:01:06,500
this and I walk around and it just sits 
there.

1288
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:11,830
But then when I throw it over my left 
shoulder it slumps down and it's 

1289
01:01:11,830 --> 01:01:16,481
awkward.
Like I can't carry it on my skin right 

1290
01:01:16,481 --> 01:01:16,481
now.
But you know,

1291
01:01:16,481 --> 01:01:17,510
like my left shoulder doesn't know how 
to keep it up.

1292
01:01:17,511 --> 01:01:18,980
And I was like,
well what the fuck is going on?

1293
01:01:18,981 --> 01:01:23,981
Why does it keep doing this?
Why does it keep falling over my left 

1294
01:01:23,981 --> 01:01:23,981
one when I put on my right one,
boom,

1295
01:01:23,981 --> 01:01:25,790
it just locks in place there.
It's effortless,

1296
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:28,970
but over my left one it's like a lot of 
extra work.

1297
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:31,520
So I started carrying it only on my left
one,

1298
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:32,500
like,
you know,

1299
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:35,540
pick up the slack bitch.
But it's odd,

1300
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:38,720
like I think I'm in balanced in some 
sort of strange way.

1301
01:01:38,810 --> 01:01:39,290
Yeah.
Well,

1302
01:01:39,291 --> 01:01:42,290
you know,
the shape of your body is down on the,

1303
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:43,910
on the cellular level,
you know,

1304
01:01:43,911 --> 01:01:48,911
they look at bones and people they can 
tell who his right hand and you'll be 

1305
01:01:48,911 --> 01:01:49,040
able to tell you right handed or left 
handed.

1306
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,390
That's how all that anthropological data
just.

1307
01:01:51,470 --> 01:01:56,470
Yeah,
it's bone robust tenicity the size and 

1308
01:01:56,470 --> 01:01:58,361
the shape of your bone lets people know 
what you did with your body while you 

1309
01:01:58,361 --> 01:01:58,361
were here.

1310
01:01:58,361 --> 01:02:03,130
Well that's also why bounce in like 
certain exercises like pictures and 

1311
01:02:03,130 --> 01:02:07,871
stuff.
They get imbalanced because they're 

1312
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:07,871
always throwing with your right hand.
Like my friend Steve Maxwell,

1313
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:12,460
he's worked with a lot of people that 
have issues with their back and stuff 

1314
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:15,191
and like one of them was a kicker and he
fixed it all by making them kick with 

1315
01:02:15,191 --> 01:02:15,440
the left leg.
It was like,

1316
01:02:15,441 --> 01:02:17,360
you're own kicking with your right leg 
all the time.

1317
01:02:17,361 --> 01:02:19,040
Do you ever kick with your left leg?
Then I was like,

1318
01:02:19,050 --> 01:02:20,070
no.
Like

1319
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,690
you need to do that.
Like you're,

1320
01:02:21,691 --> 01:02:26,691
you're,
you're loading up one side of your body 

1321
01:02:26,691 --> 01:02:29,420
constantly all day and the other side is
getting virtually no movement in the 

1322
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:34,161
same direction.
So it's just going to have to start 

1323
01:02:34,161 --> 01:02:34,161
doing.
And all of his problems went away.

1324
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:36,590
Yeah.
You can't just do heavy,

1325
01:02:36,770 --> 01:02:41,770
high loads on one side all day long.
Is your sport like that can't be your 

1326
01:02:41,770 --> 01:02:42,980
sport.
It has to a little bit better balanced.

1327
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:45,310
But isn't that incredible?
Because I don't think pitchers,

1328
01:02:45,550 --> 01:02:50,550
I don't,
I really don't know what they do about 

1329
01:02:50,550 --> 01:02:52,861
that now.
I think it's probably more people like 

1330
01:02:52,861 --> 01:02:52,861
you now that are interacting with these 
guys and teaching them things.

1331
01:02:52,861 --> 01:02:55,060
But I think for the most part they just 
throw the one arm

1332
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:56,340
they do.
And the thing with the thing,

1333
01:02:56,341 --> 01:02:58,370
with the picture data,
like in the CTCS,

1334
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:01,470
um,
it's not just muscle,

1335
01:03:01,471 --> 01:03:03,500
like it's easy to correct a muscle 
imbalance.

1336
01:03:03,501 --> 01:03:04,290
It's like,
Oh,

1337
01:03:04,291 --> 01:03:09,291
you clearly,
you can see that there's more muscle 

1338
01:03:09,291 --> 01:03:09,291
mass on one side.
Their bone,

1339
01:03:09,291 --> 01:03:14,090
the bone itself is torked now.
So that the reason that you know if you 

1340
01:03:14,341 --> 01:03:15,930
have enough,
if you wind up,

1341
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:20,960
if you imagine winding up,
there's this great need for range of 

1342
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:21,480
motion behind you and your body is very 
efficient.

1343
01:03:21,481 --> 01:03:25,650
If you are going to keep challenging the
muscles to get longer,

1344
01:03:25,651 --> 01:03:29,160
to stretch to that position,
it will just move the bone there so that

1345
01:03:29,161 --> 01:03:31,620
the muscles can go back to kind of their
regular length.

1346
01:03:31,621 --> 01:03:36,060
So now you have the same range of motion
in both arms,

1347
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:41,270
but the range of motion isn't a 
different location on your pitching arm 

1348
01:03:41,270 --> 01:03:41,940
because you've twisted the bone there.

1349
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:46,940
So that phenomenon of,
of your bones being shaped by what you 

1350
01:03:47,491 --> 01:03:49,170
do is happening to all of us all the 
time.

1351
01:03:49,171 --> 01:03:50,760
People will say like,
have tibial torsion,

1352
01:03:50,761 --> 01:03:51,900
you know,
like in my lower leg.

1353
01:03:51,901 --> 01:03:52,320
It's like,
yes,

1354
01:03:52,321 --> 01:03:57,321
your gait pattern has slowly wound your 
bones so that your foot is no longer in 

1355
01:03:57,751 --> 01:04:01,860
the same plane as it once was or would 
have been.

1356
01:04:01,861 --> 01:04:06,861
So you already are an entirely different
shape than you would have been had you 

1357
01:04:06,861 --> 01:04:06,861
been moving differently throughout your 
life.

1358
01:04:06,861 --> 01:04:07,380
You're,
you're,

1359
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:11,820
you're not just like more or less muscle
in shape or out of shape.

1360
01:04:11,850 --> 01:04:13,350
You're an entirely different shape.

1361
01:04:13,790 --> 01:04:15,680
Whoa.
So,

1362
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:20,910
um,
I started doing martial arts when I was 

1363
01:04:20,910 --> 01:04:23,051
a young boy and did it all throughout my
adolescent years through puberty.

1364
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:29,030
That's probably my body sort of 
developed to do those movements.

1365
01:04:30,230 --> 01:04:32,930
That's one of the reasons why when you 
take people,

1366
01:04:33,410 --> 01:04:36,110
one of the big issues with a martial 
arts,

1367
01:04:36,170 --> 01:04:41,170
some martial arts that have really 
difficult for older people to learn and 

1368
01:04:41,170 --> 01:04:43,010
kicking seems to be one of the hardest 
ones.

1369
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:48,250
For whatever reason your body just does 
not want to learn that as an older 

1370
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:48,250
person.
But as a young person,

1371
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:50,960
like my six year old,
her little hips are just so,

1372
01:04:50,961 --> 01:04:55,961
like loose.
She knows she can just throw her legs 

1373
01:04:55,961 --> 01:04:55,961
around.
There's no resistance,

1374
01:04:55,961 --> 01:04:59,770
but old people,
it's very difficult getting into 

1375
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:00,200
properly with enough speed and,
and to,

1376
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:05,530
to have impact.
But if you get someone that's the same 

1377
01:05:05,530 --> 01:05:07,190
age has been doing it since there were 
child there could do it really quickly.

1378
01:05:07,530 --> 01:05:10,340
It's was like there's something about 
the body developing,

1379
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:11,540
doing those movements.

1380
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:12,240
Yeah.
You know,

1381
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:16,540
zero to zero to five is the most where 
you're the most malleable,

1382
01:05:16,690 --> 01:05:18,190
like your skeleton isn't

1383
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:23,190
even set yet,
but then when you go from five to 15 and

1384
01:05:24,011 --> 01:05:29,011
probably all the way up to 20,
then you are much more malleable than 

1385
01:05:29,011 --> 01:05:30,010
you will be after your.
Your bone,

1386
01:05:31,390 --> 01:05:33,490
your bone.
We say bone density because it's easiest

1387
01:05:33,491 --> 01:05:36,340
to measure,
but your bone shape and all that entails

1388
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:40,780
is set really for life at that point.
So you know if you would squat,

1389
01:05:40,781 --> 01:05:43,120
so you probably squat a lot more.
At least if you're in a martial art,

1390
01:05:43,121 --> 01:05:44,710
a lot of times they're squatting put 
into it,

1391
01:05:44,711 --> 01:05:46,750
but if you take someone who's been 
sitting at their office,

1392
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:49,330
you know,
using a toilet their whole entire life,

1393
01:05:49,331 --> 01:05:53,290
their hips have never articulated to 
that degree that you're,

1394
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:58,440
that you're asking them to.
And in the tradition of the martial art 

1395
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:01,201
that people who came up with the martial
art oftentimes live in entirely 

1396
01:06:01,201 --> 01:06:01,330
different lifestyle.

1397
01:06:01,330 --> 01:06:02,490
Where they're shaped.
They're.

1398
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:07,560
There are shapes that facilitate sports 
better and the in the shape that 

1399
01:06:07,721 --> 01:06:12,721
facilitates.
It tends to come from the areas that 

1400
01:06:12,721 --> 01:06:14,911
create whatever the sport is that you're
talking about because anthropometric 

1401
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:16,660
dimensions are the size and the shape of
your body.

1402
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:21,900
Sports and leverages that you create are
heavily dependent on anther prometric 

1403
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:26,821
dimensions and so your pelvis you might 
not be able to kick because your pelvis 

1404
01:06:26,821 --> 01:06:31,770
is shaped by not kicking like you have a
not kicking pelvis because you were a 

1405
01:06:31,770 --> 01:06:35,701
non kicker.
You can't just all of a sudden start to 

1406
01:06:35,701 --> 01:06:38,641
be a kicker any any more than the 
pitcher can decide to not have it 

1407
01:06:38,641 --> 01:06:39,550
twisted bone in his arm anymore after 
throwing his whole entire life.

1408
01:06:39,590 --> 01:06:44,590
So if you develop your whole life as a 
non kick and then someone tries to show 

1409
01:06:44,590 --> 01:06:44,590
you kicking techniques,
is there.

1410
01:06:44,590 --> 01:06:49,301
Is there a way to open you up and make 
you more pliable and make your body 

1411
01:06:49,941 --> 01:06:51,440
adapt to those movements better?

1412
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:56,560
I think that there is because you are 
malleable really as a structure 

1413
01:06:56,560 --> 01:07:00,431
throughout your entire life.
I just think that it's larger than do 

1414
01:07:00,431 --> 01:07:04,481
this kick over and over and over again,
that there are ways to facilitate the 

1415
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:09,521
mobility of the entire structure.
So if it were me and I was trying to 

1416
01:07:09,521 --> 01:07:10,190
teach them martial art,
it wouldn't just be the kick.

1417
01:07:10,191 --> 01:07:10,880
I'd be like,
what?

1418
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:16,390
What do these that are good at kicking?
Like what are the other lifestyle 

1419
01:07:16,390 --> 01:07:16,390
things?
It's,

1420
01:07:16,390 --> 01:07:17,240
it's about frequency.
It's not enough.

1421
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:22,270
It's not enough load like not kicking.
You're constantly adapting to not 

1422
01:07:22,270 --> 01:07:23,780
kicking.
So the amount that you kick is,

1423
01:07:23,781 --> 01:07:25,740
I mean how many kicks are you going to 
practice 100.

1424
01:07:25,850 --> 01:07:30,850
100.
Like it's so it's so it's so it's too 

1425
01:07:30,850 --> 01:07:30,850
small.
It's so small.

1426
01:07:30,850 --> 01:07:34,910
What you're asking to adapt to that.
There are ways to create change in shape

1427
01:07:34,911 --> 01:07:39,911
and bones and that there's evidence that
it really does happen throughout a 

1428
01:07:39,911 --> 01:07:43,001
lifetime.
It's just the exercise paradigm is so 

1429
01:07:43,001 --> 01:07:45,641
small to training paradigm is so small.
It's like if you want to become more 

1430
01:07:45,641 --> 01:07:49,091
malleable,
you have to change everything that you 

1431
01:07:49,091 --> 01:07:49,091
do all of the time and you will adapt to
that.

1432
01:07:49,091 --> 01:07:53,910
Do people have a built in limitation as 
far as their flexibility or is it simply

1433
01:07:55,421 --> 01:07:59,520
a matter of the amount of time and 
effort you spend trying to explain?

1434
01:07:59,590 --> 01:08:01,060
You expand your flexibility?

1435
01:08:01,390 --> 01:08:06,390
I don't think humans have a builtin 
limitation from birth,

1436
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:09,730
but I think that your range of motion 
gets set really,

1437
01:08:09,970 --> 01:08:13,980
really early and we are in a mobilizing 
culture like we a mobilizer.

1438
01:08:13,990 --> 01:08:17,570
Babies really like the whole culture 
really doesn't work unless your kids are

1439
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:23,020
quiet and still in someplace at the time
in which are the most dynamic and I'm 

1440
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:26,870
now people now,
you know,

1441
01:08:26,871 --> 01:08:29,090
we used to roll around in the back of 
our station wagon,

1442
01:08:29,091 --> 01:08:34,091
but now kids are like locked in even 
more for a longer period of time and 

1443
01:08:34,091 --> 01:08:37,070
they have more casts on them now so 
they're very,

1444
01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:42,071
very inflexible.
Extremely inflexible or the ranges of 

1445
01:08:42,071 --> 01:08:44,660
motion are in way different planes than 
they would be.

1446
01:08:44,661 --> 01:08:48,770
So like you can still have 50 degrees of
hip motion,

1447
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:52,250
but it's all in front of you instead of 
port of it being behind you.

1448
01:08:52,690 --> 01:08:53,660
Right?
Yeah.

1449
01:08:53,661 --> 01:08:58,661
That's one of the weird ones I'm in 
teaching is teaching people to lift 

1450
01:08:58,671 --> 01:09:02,120
their leg up and to move it.
Like in this range,

1451
01:09:02,330 --> 01:09:05,510
like whether it's a cross or this one is
even weirder.

1452
01:09:05,511 --> 01:09:07,460
Lifting your leg up,
what's called a hook kick.

1453
01:09:07,790 --> 01:09:10,070
You lift your leg up and bring it 
across.

1454
01:09:10,071 --> 01:09:15,071
This way it's just a different movement 
and a looseness of the hips and I've 

1455
01:09:15,071 --> 01:09:17,870
talked to people about it and one of the
big copout as people go,

1456
01:09:17,871 --> 01:09:20,810
I'm not naturally flexible.
You're naturally flexible and I'm like,

1457
01:09:20,811 --> 01:09:22,130
man,
I don't know about all that.

1458
01:09:22,190 --> 01:09:25,130
I don't seem naturally flexible.
I see my mom,

1459
01:09:25,131 --> 01:09:30,131
I see my sister like they're not.
They're not any but I've done it my 

1460
01:09:30,131 --> 01:09:30,890
whole life so I.
I've become.

1461
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:35,510
But there was this guy that used to work
out at our gym and he was a really,

1462
01:09:35,511 --> 01:09:40,511
like I'm very dedicated athletes,
a pro football player who retired and 

1463
01:09:40,511 --> 01:09:45,200
started getting into Jujitsu and he had 
massive flexibility issues for a while,

1464
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:50,320
but this guy was such a dedicated 
athlete that he would get after 

1465
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:50,320
practice,
he would,

1466
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:54,710
he would do his training and then he 
would stretch just like painful 

1467
01:09:54,710 --> 01:09:54,710
stretches.

1468
01:09:54,710 --> 01:09:59,710
You could see that guy putting way more 
time in it and then like a year later 

1469
01:09:59,710 --> 01:10:03,581
he's doing the splits and you know,
I pointed it out to everybody in the 

1470
01:10:03,581 --> 01:10:03,581
class.
I go,

1471
01:10:03,581 --> 01:10:07,370
I don't want to hear anybody tell me you
can't get flexible because this fucking 

1472
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:08,300
guy got flexible in a year,
like in a year,

1473
01:10:08,301 --> 01:10:12,590
this guy was this giant,
250 pound like giant quads,

1474
01:10:12,710 --> 01:10:17,710
like all stiff from all these years of 
dead lifting and all that jazz and this 

1475
01:10:17,710 --> 01:10:17,710
guy figured out like,
hey,

1476
01:10:17,710 --> 01:10:20,240
in order to get good at Jujitsu,
I'm going to have to really stretch,

1477
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,400
and we all used him as an example.
Okay,

1478
01:10:22,401 --> 01:10:24,260
now I know like it,
it can be done,

1479
01:10:24,261 --> 01:10:27,060
but you got to really do it and you've 
got to do it.

1480
01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:32,110
It's gonna.
It's gonna suck and it's not going to 

1481
01:10:32,110 --> 01:10:32,110
feel comfortable.
It's gonna.

1482
01:10:32,110 --> 01:10:32,660
You're gonna have to stretch that tissue
out.

1483
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:34,090
Yeah,
it's frequency.

1484
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:39,360
I mean,
I think the easiest way to say is it's 

1485
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:39,360
all changeable,
but you have to be super diligent.

1486
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:43,921
It's about the amount of time that 
you're asking your body to do something 

1487
01:10:43,921 --> 01:10:46,480
and if you imagine the shape of whatever
kick you can do now,

1488
01:10:46,481 --> 01:10:49,210
like whatever small circle it is,
and then you imagine this,

1489
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:53,410
the kick that you want to have your 
kicks just have to.

1490
01:10:53,570 --> 01:10:55,630
You have to coax the edge of it.
It's like you're.

1491
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,100
Your body's like clay,
right?

1492
01:10:57,101 --> 01:10:59,860
You're just a matter of you're just 
doing the slow reshaping,

1493
01:10:59,861 --> 01:11:04,861
your slowly reshaping and and you want 
to just be imagining the shape that 

1494
01:11:05,021 --> 01:11:08,170
you're trying to make and you're just 
pushing the limits of the tissue because

1495
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:10,120
you,
you've been doing it so long,

1496
01:11:10,121 --> 01:11:13,120
you have the parts.
Your muscle mass becomes longer,

1497
01:11:13,230 --> 01:11:14,700
shorter as necessary.

1498
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:19,700
The,
the orientation of the bone in its 

1499
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:19,800
socket and all those support issues like
those,

1500
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:21,480
it takes a while to adapt.
Takes a year.

1501
01:11:21,481 --> 01:11:23,220
It's not like I've been doing this for 
six weeks.

1502
01:11:23,221 --> 01:11:28,221
When is it going to get better?
It's like you're not doing it for 40 

1503
01:11:28,221 --> 01:11:28,260
years,
so you just have to look about.

1504
01:11:28,530 --> 01:11:30,390
You have to look at it more in terms of 
time,

1505
01:11:30,391 --> 01:11:35,391
like realistic time and physiology,
and I think anyone can really accomplish

1506
01:11:35,641 --> 01:11:37,680
some serious physical,
physiological,

1507
01:11:37,681 --> 01:11:40,230
physical transformations,
but again,

1508
01:11:40,231 --> 01:11:43,230
not in that one hour that they allow 
themselves three times a week.

1509
01:11:43,231 --> 01:11:45,240
It's got to be bigger.
Everybody wants a pill.

1510
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:47,640
Sure,
fucking Dr.

1511
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:51,150
every time you seen him on TV,
he's pushing some God damn diet pill.

1512
01:11:51,151 --> 01:11:53,340
They dragged him in front of Congress 
because of that shit.

1513
01:11:53,790 --> 01:11:57,620
He was lying about Miracle Diet pills,
but that's a real issue with our culture

1514
01:11:57,621 --> 01:11:58,260
is we want to.

1515
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:03,640
We want to eat things to lose weight.
We want to put more food in our fat 

1516
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:04,950
faces and we just want,
oh,

1517
01:12:04,951 --> 01:12:09,951
this,
this diet is going to make you lose 

1518
01:12:09,951 --> 01:12:12,171
weight,
but what what you're doing by telling 

1519
01:12:12,171 --> 01:12:14,070
people that that you can have a pill and
lose weight is you're,

1520
01:12:14,071 --> 01:12:16,680
you're.
What you're doing is denying the reality

1521
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:21,860
of change and that change requires time 
and effort and you can't just pop 

1522
01:12:22,381 --> 01:12:27,381
something in there and get a shot and 
everything goes away and all your fat 

1523
01:12:27,381 --> 01:12:27,500
shrinks away.
And like,

1524
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:30,330
people that want to like,
there's this friend,

1525
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:33,120
um,
she uh,

1526
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:38,300
got liposuction and didn't need it.
I mean she might've been 20 pounds 

1527
01:12:39,331 --> 01:12:41,730
overweight.
Like maybe if that,

1528
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:45,240
like that's a few months of dedication.
That's it.

1529
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:48,330
Just a few months of let's watch our 
diet,

1530
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:49,670
let's you know,
and you know,

1531
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:52,290
she's got kids and Blah Blah Blah and 
she,

1532
01:12:52,291 --> 01:12:53,850
you know,
has a business and blah blah blah.

1533
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:58,870
She just doesn't have that much time.
But you gotTa fucking vacuum stuffed 

1534
01:12:58,870 --> 01:13:03,831
under your skin and they sucked all the 
fat out and now you've got to wear a 

1535
01:13:03,831 --> 01:13:05,280
girdle and they going to wear these 
compression shorts and shit.

1536
01:13:05,281 --> 01:13:08,690
And everything's all fucked up and lumpy
and like it's crazy.

1537
01:13:08,770 --> 01:13:11,910
Oozing postures,
a drain on her leg because the,

1538
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:13,980
the,
the fact that they suck out of it,

1539
01:13:13,981 --> 01:13:17,550
like everything gets infected and it's 
all fucking pussy and shit.

1540
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:21,450
Like you're going to go through two 
months of rehabilitation,

1541
01:13:21,690 --> 01:13:23,820
you're going to recover.
It's going to take you like,

1542
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:27,150
yeah,
you look slightly thinner right away,

1543
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:32,420
but at what cost.
But the instantaneous nature of the 

1544
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:34,890
gratification of just going to the 
doctor or are going to suck it all out.

1545
01:13:34,891 --> 01:13:39,891
Right?
Like the same thing as the doctor 

1546
01:13:39,891 --> 01:13:39,891
telling me,
Oh,

1547
01:13:39,891 --> 01:13:39,891
you're going to,
we're going to have to fuse her desk.

1548
01:13:39,891 --> 01:13:40,770
Like you're going to what?
Like wait a minute,

1549
01:13:40,771 --> 01:13:42,270
I'm moving around.
Everything seems to be.

1550
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:44,970
There's no way to fix this.
It's just going to get worse.

1551
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,490
Like they always say,
it's just gonna get worse.

1552
01:13:47,730 --> 01:13:52,730
Well,
if I continue to do the same shit that 

1553
01:13:52,730 --> 01:13:53,130
made it bad,
it's just going to get worse.

1554
01:13:53,131 --> 01:13:56,850
Right?
Isn't there some sort of a way to change

1555
01:13:56,851 --> 01:13:59,820
that?
But nobody thinks about it that way.

1556
01:13:59,850 --> 01:14:04,850
Everybody wants instantaneous 
gratification where there's a weird 

1557
01:14:04,850 --> 01:14:09,081
space right now where we want,
we want to be better in the very same 

1558
01:14:09,081 --> 01:14:13,941
habit,
doing the same things that got us to 

1559
01:14:13,941 --> 01:14:13,941
where we are in the first place.
Like it's

1560
01:14:13,941 --> 01:14:13,941
so weird.
It's like when does that work?

1561
01:14:13,941 --> 01:14:17,620
Anywhere else where like this is,
this is what has happened,

1562
01:14:17,621 --> 01:14:22,621
this is the,
this is the ramifications of all those 

1563
01:14:22,621 --> 01:14:23,230
things that you did.
So the solution,

1564
01:14:23,231 --> 01:14:28,231
the pill is really so that I don't have 
to change any of those things that got 

1565
01:14:28,231 --> 01:14:31,591
me there.
It's like everyone should take a class 

1566
01:14:31,591 --> 01:14:31,591
in human physiology or something.

1567
01:14:31,670 --> 01:14:33,820
Well,
there's also the reality of life.

1568
01:14:33,870 --> 01:14:35,670
Dove work,
you know,

1569
01:14:35,690 --> 01:14:40,690
most people have a job that requires 
them to stay in a spot and it's really 

1570
01:14:40,791 --> 01:14:43,190
difficult to do anything about it.
I have this Jarvis desks,

1571
01:14:43,191 --> 01:14:44,150
not this one,
but uh,

1572
01:14:44,390 --> 01:14:46,580
over there and the other room that uh,
Jamie setup,

1573
01:14:46,581 --> 01:14:48,500
you press a button and it stands with 
you.

1574
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:52,790
So like as you were at your office,
you can do this and you can just go back

1575
01:14:52,791 --> 01:14:57,791
and sit down and you move around.
The idea is to give yourself like a 

1576
01:14:57,791 --> 01:15:00,611
couple of minutes sitting a couple 
minutes standing and keep moving like 

1577
01:15:00,611 --> 01:15:00,611
Zach,

1578
01:15:00,611 --> 01:15:01,300
is that effective?
That's good.

1579
01:15:01,301 --> 01:15:03,580
Amazing.
So there's like a whole,

1580
01:15:03,910 --> 01:15:06,760
if you just talk about your office,
I'm not,

1581
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:08,660
I like the standing workstation,
right?

1582
01:15:08,661 --> 01:15:10,810
So the sitting kills stuff sitting's 
worse than smoking.

1583
01:15:10,820 --> 01:15:14,320
Then everyone's like,
I'm never gonna sit down ever worse.

1584
01:15:14,321 --> 01:15:16,120
Right.
I don't know if you chain smoke.

1585
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:18,790
Well,
have you been changed sitting for a long

1586
01:15:18,791 --> 01:15:23,791
time?
What'd you chain smoke end chain set 

1587
01:15:23,791 --> 01:15:25,950
than your far.
Well maybe it's smoking has been saving 

1588
01:15:25,950 --> 01:15:25,950
your life by going outside for a smoke 
break.

1589
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:28,810
So small walks,
you know now like the literature is like

1590
01:15:28,811 --> 01:15:32,230
make sure you take a small walk every 20
minutes like that times perfectly with a

1591
01:15:32,231 --> 01:15:37,231
cigarette break.
And since it's not since it's the old 

1592
01:15:37,231 --> 01:15:37,231
smoking,
so old smoking.

1593
01:15:37,231 --> 01:15:37,231
But could you imagine

1594
01:15:37,231 --> 01:15:38,980
someone telling you,
uh,

1595
01:15:38,990 --> 01:15:39,550
you know,
I'll,

1596
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:44,560
I'll work in your office by gotta to 
take a walk every 20 minutes like fuck 

1597
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:44,560
off.
You're not going to get anything done.

1598
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,090
Well I,
you know what I tell people all the time

1599
01:15:46,091 --> 01:15:48,910
that they should do their phone calls,
walking,

1600
01:15:49,530 --> 01:15:50,650
like,
like make your,

1601
01:15:50,651 --> 01:15:55,651
save up your phone calls and then just 
go out and just take a 20 minute stroll 

1602
01:15:55,651 --> 01:15:57,430
or whatever.
And just gotTa stop right here.

1603
01:15:57,431 --> 01:15:59,230
Because I don't have service for.
Keep walking.

1604
01:15:59,730 --> 01:16:04,730
Yeah.
See I live in the cities all different 

1605
01:16:04,730 --> 01:16:04,730
now.
I don't know where these things.

1606
01:16:04,730 --> 01:16:08,910
What will you,
where you live and you get cell phone 

1607
01:16:08,910 --> 01:16:10,861
service.
I do everywhere I cell phone service 

1608
01:16:10,861 --> 01:16:10,870
now.
We have in China right everywhere.

1609
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:13,290
Even that can be good.
Has that bad,

1610
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:16,660
bad for bees,
cell phone service.

1611
01:16:18,030 --> 01:16:19,870
You know what,
that whole emf thing,

1612
01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:25,470
they wanted to put some emf weapons up 
in an hour in our woods there so that 

1613
01:16:25,601 --> 01:16:30,601
it's like we've,
there's no literature that shows that 

1614
01:16:30,601 --> 01:16:33,361
they're bad for the body.
So we're going to put some emf weapons 

1615
01:16:33,361 --> 01:16:33,361
and was like,
what?

1616
01:16:33,361 --> 01:16:33,361
That's crazy.
Yeah,

1617
01:16:33,361 --> 01:16:37,920
I've seen some interesting studies.
Clearly it's doing something so the,

1618
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:43,750
the easiest tissue to test his sperm 
because you can get as much sperm to 

1619
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:44,770
test and you can,
you can.

1620
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:48,850
It's a ethical I guess to expose it to 
emf so they can take,

1621
01:16:49,170 --> 01:16:50,800
you know,
just gonna throw it away anyway,

1622
01:16:51,010 --> 01:16:56,010
so you can take us to sperm samples and 
you can put one next to a phone or you 

1623
01:16:56,801 --> 01:17:01,801
can have a guy where a phone on his hip 
and the sperm is different after having 

1624
01:17:02,471 --> 01:17:07,471
it.
So they don't know if it's the heat of 

1625
01:17:07,471 --> 01:17:07,471
the device because there's a device in 
your pocket,

1626
01:17:07,471 --> 01:17:11,941
you know,
a lot of people carry it right there in 

1627
01:17:11,941 --> 01:17:11,941
their pocket or right there in their 
shirt pockets,

1628
01:17:11,941 --> 01:17:11,941
you know,
um,

1629
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:14,960
whether it's the heat or the EMF,
they haven't really broken it down.

1630
01:17:14,961 --> 01:17:17,510
And I've seen some,
some other smaller studies on,

1631
01:17:17,930 --> 01:17:19,910
on um,
uh,

1632
01:17:19,990 --> 01:17:21,170
fetuses,
you know,

1633
01:17:21,171 --> 01:17:26,171
where they make the mother have a device
and where a device to see what the cells

1634
01:17:26,510 --> 01:17:27,050
look like.

1635
01:17:27,050 --> 01:17:32,050
So the data isn't,
the data is pointing that there is some 

1636
01:17:32,050 --> 01:17:34,310
sort of change all with all that kind of
stuff.

1637
01:17:34,311 --> 01:17:36,230
It's like the dose makes the poison.
How much,

1638
01:17:36,231 --> 01:17:39,710
what is the change significant.
Like what's gonna happen with that sperm

1639
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:41,900
that's different.
Nobody knows any of that.

1640
01:17:41,901 --> 01:17:43,940
So I guess just say,
just say,

1641
01:17:43,941 --> 01:17:44,870
well,
use your phone.

1642
01:17:44,871 --> 01:17:49,871
I turn my phone off of air.
I put it on airplane mode if it's going 

1643
01:17:49,871 --> 01:17:51,050
to be by my head when I go to sleep.
And other than that,

1644
01:17:51,051 --> 01:17:53,960
I don't keep it on my body or near my 
body.

1645
01:17:54,070 --> 01:17:56,060
Why do you keep it by your head?
Well yeah,

1646
01:17:56,061 --> 01:17:57,830
like if it's,
if it's my alarm or whatever,

1647
01:17:57,831 --> 01:17:59,690
so I was like,
you can use it for an alarm,

1648
01:17:59,691 --> 01:18:01,010
just turn,
you can turn it off.

1649
01:18:01,011 --> 01:18:02,840
So that's not transmitted admitting 
anything.

1650
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:04,820
Right.
But is it's still generating heat?

1651
01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:08,060
Well it's not touching me anymore so 
it's not all my skin.

1652
01:18:08,260 --> 01:18:11,450
But if you carry it in your pocket,
if you're carrying in your pocket,

1653
01:18:11,451 --> 01:18:14,150
it would still be.
It generates heat more I think when it's

1654
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:15,110
transmitting

1655
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:18,500
wonder if people just show up like years
now everyone has asked cancer

1656
01:18:18,990 --> 01:18:23,950
back pocket area ships are all aligned 
but now they have asked answer.

1657
01:18:24,170 --> 01:18:29,170
I think like Sheryl Crow has brain 
cancer and she was saying that they were

1658
01:18:29,781 --> 01:18:34,781
trying to attribute it to or possibly 
attributed to when she was doing press 

1659
01:18:34,971 --> 01:18:39,971
for her first cd was the old days of 
cell phones and she did all of it 

1660
01:18:39,971 --> 01:18:44,291
through her mobile phone.
She had it up to her head the entire 

1661
01:18:44,291 --> 01:18:45,620
time and it's that side of her head that
she has the issue with.

1662
01:18:47,030 --> 01:18:52,030
I think that we,
we do a lot of stuff that we have no 

1663
01:18:52,030 --> 01:18:53,250
idea how it's gonna,
you know,

1664
01:18:53,380 --> 01:18:54,460
trickle down later

1665
01:18:54,790 --> 01:18:56,260
about it.
Like everywhere we go,

1666
01:18:56,460 --> 01:18:59,830
you're experiencing wifi signals,
radio signals,

1667
01:19:00,050 --> 01:19:01,240
um,
you know,

1668
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:04,090
I don't know.
How does the satellite thing work?

1669
01:19:04,420 --> 01:19:09,420
I mean you have to Kinda like have a,
an antenna or a dish that points up to 

1670
01:19:09,420 --> 01:19:11,110
where the satellite is sending the 
signal,

1671
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:13,900
but that signal somehow or another 
getting here,

1672
01:19:13,901 --> 01:19:17,200
whether it hits your dish or not,
is it getting to bodies?

1673
01:19:18,190 --> 01:19:20,650
We know that cell phone signals fuck 
with bees.

1674
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:26,300
Like that's one of the things that 
they've figured out when they were 

1675
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:26,530
trying to figure out what's killing off 
all these honeybees.

1676
01:19:26,950 --> 01:19:29,740
Most,
most things point towards pesticides,

1677
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:35,040
but there is an disease,
but there's also some issue that we 

1678
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:39,121
might be constantly fucking with their 
navigation and their ability to 

1679
01:19:39,121 --> 01:19:43,411
communicate.
It's almost like living next door to 

1680
01:19:43,411 --> 01:19:43,900
people that are just playing loud rock 
music all day.

1681
01:19:44,140 --> 01:19:46,060
Do you survive?
Yes you do.

1682
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:48,160
But does it fuck with the quality of 
your life?

1683
01:19:48,370 --> 01:19:49,120
Yeah,
it does.

1684
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:54,560
You know,
and because bees have this weird way of 

1685
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:56,521
communicating with each other that seems
to be interfering or with the cellular 

1686
01:19:57,281 --> 01:19:59,710
systems that we have seems to be 
interfering with that.

1687
01:20:00,070 --> 01:20:05,070
Well,
and they've shown it was sonar and the 

1688
01:20:05,070 --> 01:20:05,070
whales,
you know,

1689
01:20:05,070 --> 01:20:06,830
everything is just messed up by these 
things,

1690
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:08,190
these,
that we're creating

1691
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:10,050
for whatever,
you know,

1692
01:20:10,051 --> 01:20:11,820
they're,
they're tangible,

1693
01:20:11,821 --> 01:20:16,821
they're invisible.
I think it's just because they're 

1694
01:20:16,821 --> 01:20:18,411
invisible.
We just don't think of visible things 

1695
01:20:18,411 --> 01:20:20,691
having any sort of impacts like wrap me 
up in something I want to head pounding 

1696
01:20:20,691 --> 01:20:21,510
against my head.
But if I can't see it,

1697
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:24,600
how much could it really be harming me.
Meanwhile,

1698
01:20:24,601 --> 01:20:29,601
every everyone's writing up this huge 
list of things that are wrong with them 

1699
01:20:29,601 --> 01:20:29,690
and what they're searching for and we're
just flapping on uh,

1700
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:35,240
well it's just idiopathic or genetic or,
or whatever has no cause no known cause 

1701
01:20:35,341 --> 01:20:37,020
it just happens.
It's normal.

1702
01:20:37,110 --> 01:20:37,590
And it's like,
yeah,

1703
01:20:37,591 --> 01:20:42,591
but.
So our cell phone towers or chairs and 

1704
01:20:42,591 --> 01:20:42,591
all this other stuff.

1705
01:20:42,591 --> 01:20:46,420
Well,
there's a weird feeling that you get 

1706
01:20:46,420 --> 01:20:46,420
when you get to a completely deserted 
place,

1707
01:20:46,420 --> 01:20:49,070
like a real wilderness place with total 
quiet,

1708
01:20:49,071 --> 01:20:50,780
no cell phone service,
no nothing.

1709
01:20:52,970 --> 01:20:55,460
Yeah.
This is weird.

1710
01:20:55,461 --> 01:20:59,000
Like absence of input that you feel 
different.

1711
01:20:59,040 --> 01:20:59,660
They're like,
wow,

1712
01:20:59,661 --> 01:21:01,790
this feels weird.
Like I gotta get Outta here.

1713
01:21:02,690 --> 01:21:07,690
Desolate feels like so it's so 
unforgiving.

1714
01:21:07,841 --> 01:21:09,920
It just doesn't give a fuck if you're 
around or not around.

1715
01:21:09,921 --> 01:21:14,921
It's like that silence for whatever.
It's almost like people that are afraid 

1716
01:21:14,921 --> 01:21:18,461
to be alone,
like you have to be out at parties all 

1717
01:21:18,461 --> 01:21:20,591
the time.
It got to constantly be talking to 

1718
01:21:20,591 --> 01:21:21,971
people on the phone when you're alone 
and you have to deal with your own 

1719
01:21:21,971 --> 01:21:23,891
bullshit.
When you go to those will true 

1720
01:21:23,891 --> 01:21:24,200
wilderness areas with no cell phone 
service.

1721
01:21:24,201 --> 01:21:25,700
It's like,
oh,

1722
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:27,020
okay.
A little scary.

1723
01:21:27,050 --> 01:21:28,630
This is real.
You know,

1724
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:31,130
we try to go dark like two days a week.
Dark,

1725
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:33,680
dark wood in the diamond family.

1726
01:21:33,730 --> 01:21:38,730
Yes.
The Bowman Bowman family goes dark two 

1727
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:41,791
days a week and you just go out and 
spend more time outside than inside and 

1728
01:21:41,791 --> 01:21:43,390
that's a great place about having great 
thing about having the wilderness.

1729
01:21:43,391 --> 01:21:48,391
There is like huge trees,
old growth trees have been around for a 

1730
01:21:48,391 --> 01:21:50,450
long time and one time it was windy and 
trees were falling

1731
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:53,080
down.
It's like trees are falling down.

1732
01:21:53,081 --> 01:21:54,880
We are in the wilderness.
It's insane.

1733
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:58,840
Well,
it happens.

1734
01:21:58,841 --> 01:21:59,830
It happens.
Yeah.

1735
01:21:59,860 --> 01:22:03,370
You say that until you get hit by a tree
that I've avoided that.

1736
01:22:03,371 --> 01:22:05,920
You don't have that laissez faire,
but it happens.

1737
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:09,220
It happens.
Maybe A.

1738
01:22:09,260 --> 01:22:10,070
Yeah.
Yeah.

1739
01:22:10,170 --> 01:22:13,240
Fucking hit by an old growth tree.
Way to go.

1740
01:22:13,310 --> 01:22:18,310
We,
we were out in one fell and it sounded 

1741
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:21,091
like a gunshot went off and we had 
determined that it was a tree that fell 

1742
01:22:21,091 --> 01:22:22,220
who was up in Canada,
but it was like boom.

1743
01:22:22,350 --> 01:22:24,760
We're like somebody out here shooting.
Like what the fuck is that?

1744
01:22:25,090 --> 01:22:28,060
And the guy that we were with,
like I don't think so.

1745
01:22:28,061 --> 01:22:31,700
I think that's a tree with a felling 
trees or no towel.

1746
01:22:32,590 --> 01:22:35,920
Just fucking had its time.
What happens when was blown like,

1747
01:22:35,921 --> 01:22:40,921
that's enough.
I'm tapping out bone and it just came 

1748
01:22:40,921 --> 01:22:40,921
down.
I mean,

1749
01:22:40,921 --> 01:22:42,070
you find them all over the place,
right?

1750
01:22:42,071 --> 01:22:46,060
There are so many trees,
but that reality that this,

1751
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:50,140
this thing has been there before 
Columbus ever get near America.

1752
01:22:50,141 --> 01:22:55,141
I mean especially where you are in the 
Pacific northwest when you're dealing 

1753
01:22:55,141 --> 01:22:56,290
with some of those trees,
like a thousand years old,

1754
01:22:56,570 --> 01:22:58,440
almost the whole planet used to be 
wooded,

1755
01:22:58,441 --> 01:22:59,790
right?
We've cut everything down.

1756
01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:01,890
It was almost all wooded.
You couldn't even.

1757
01:23:02,430 --> 01:23:06,700
You couldn't even walk.
I'm like up in up in British Columbia,

1758
01:23:06,701 --> 01:23:07,810
up there,
I was so thick.

1759
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:10,540
The all of the trees falling down for 
years.

1760
01:23:10,541 --> 01:23:14,230
All that Moss and stuff that you're 
walking on is just old mushed up,

1761
01:23:14,231 --> 01:23:19,231
rotted trees,
but you couldn't even just walk through 

1762
01:23:19,231 --> 01:23:22,141
the woods.
There are trees everywhere and they've 

1763
01:23:22,141 --> 01:23:24,900
cut everything down and so much of the 
desert that's in the middle of the 

1764
01:23:25,810 --> 01:23:27,280
United States or from those from the 
fires,

1765
01:23:27,290 --> 01:23:30,670
like when they started using lumber for 
oceans,

1766
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:35,760
ocean ships like all of the.
The British military ships came from 

1767
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:37,410
lumber from the Pacific northwest,
and they are at,

1768
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:42,420
once they realized that they had that 
commodity they are using like wasn't 

1769
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:43,870
mink Mikan Otter,
otter offers where what brought everyone

1770
01:23:43,871 --> 01:23:45,010
to the Pacific northwest.

1771
01:23:45,010 --> 01:23:47,620
They cleaned all the mountain and like 
what can we ship now if they would,

1772
01:23:48,670 --> 01:23:51,880
and then they shipped it out and they 
were making,

1773
01:23:51,940 --> 01:23:53,740
they were milling it.
So when you mill it,

1774
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:59,480
you know,
the mass of the tree is lost in between 

1775
01:23:59,480 --> 01:23:59,480
the boards.
So it's um,

1776
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:03,330
a sawdust and so sawdust was clogging 
all the rivers and there was a big fire 

1777
01:24:03,460 --> 01:24:08,460
and then the fire just went across the 
United States because there was no 

1778
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:12,610
natural water barriers anymore.
It just burnt it down,

1779
01:24:12,611 --> 01:24:13,810
kind of like your cartilage,
right?

1780
01:24:13,811 --> 01:24:15,850
You can,
you can use some cartilage grows back,

1781
01:24:15,851 --> 01:24:18,190
but if you take it all the way down to 
the bottom to the base cells,

1782
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:20,760
no more's coming back.
So that's really where that,

1783
01:24:20,761 --> 01:24:24,750
that rock,
it's really cool.

1784
01:24:24,751 --> 01:24:26,410
Have you ever used a pellet grill?
You don't.

1785
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:31,230
A pellet grill and this is company.
A bunch of companies make them,

1786
01:24:31,231 --> 01:24:36,231
but one of them that I'm friends with,
his green mountain grills and these 

1787
01:24:36,231 --> 01:24:40,011
pellet grills,
they take hardwood pellets and it's 

1788
01:24:40,011 --> 01:24:41,760
basically saw dust and they press it in 
the natural sugars.

1789
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:45,810
Allow it to maintain the shape of.
It's almost like kitty litter.

1790
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:47,250
If you have a cat.
I have a cat.

1791
01:24:47,251 --> 01:24:52,251
We use this pine.
Literally it looks real similar to the 

1792
01:24:52,251 --> 01:24:52,251
stuff that you put it in this pellet 
grill.

1793
01:24:52,251 --> 01:24:56,040
It's all digitally regulated so it can 
keep the temperature at 200 degrees.

1794
01:24:56,190 --> 01:25:01,190
Can You keep it for like seven hours 
with this like pot of of pellets and 

1795
01:25:01,190 --> 01:25:03,480
it's like super efficient and it's a 
smoker.

1796
01:25:03,550 --> 01:25:07,260
It's essentially a grill slash smoker,
but instead of like,

1797
01:25:07,261 --> 01:25:08,900
have you ever used an old school smoker?

1798
01:25:08,910 --> 01:25:11,790
Like one of those big barrel smokers,
those are pain in the ass.

1799
01:25:11,791 --> 01:25:13,950
Like you got to like regulate the 
openings,

1800
01:25:13,951 --> 01:25:16,800
the valves and make sure you get the 
right amount of temperature.

1801
01:25:16,801 --> 01:25:18,570
You've got to keep thermometers in 
there.

1802
01:25:18,571 --> 01:25:23,571
And in the old days it was super 
difficult to figure out how hot 

1803
01:25:23,571 --> 01:25:23,571
everything was,
you know?

1804
01:25:23,571 --> 01:25:25,710
And then they figured out how to put 
meat thermometer is actually in the meet

1805
01:25:25,711 --> 01:25:28,140
and have digital ones had come outside 
and give you a reading.

1806
01:25:28,141 --> 01:25:33,141
But these pellet smokers essentially 
they take all that hardwood sawdust that

1807
01:25:33,841 --> 01:25:38,841
used to be just waste and compress it 
into these little pellets and then use 

1808
01:25:38,841 --> 01:25:39,300
it to cook with smart.
Yeah,

1809
01:25:39,301 --> 01:25:44,301
it's pretty cool.
And it tastes really good too when you 

1810
01:25:44,301 --> 01:25:44,301
cook it with because you were actually.
It's real.

1811
01:25:44,301 --> 01:25:48,381
It's not like that's the big issue with 
using any sort of lighter fluid or 

1812
01:25:48,481 --> 01:25:52,440
anything like those.
Those ones that are like easy match,

1813
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:56,030
charcoal briquettes,
those chemicals and those things.

1814
01:25:56,031 --> 01:25:57,540
And you can taste it.
You smell it.

1815
01:25:58,140 --> 01:25:58,860
Yeah.
But this stuff,

1816
01:25:58,861 --> 01:26:00,430
you don't smell any of it.
So they're there,

1817
01:26:01,540 --> 01:26:02,250
you know.
But it is,

1818
01:26:03,050 --> 01:26:04,040
that's the reality of

1819
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:07,580
chopping down trees just looks gross and
it makes you feel sad when you see it.

1820
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:10,730
But your house is warm because he 
chopped down trees.

1821
01:26:10,980 --> 01:26:12,330
Yeah,
it's,

1822
01:26:13,330 --> 01:26:14,860
yeah,
it's a cutting.

1823
01:26:15,230 --> 01:26:19,150
It's sad to be up there and don't drive 
by a forest that's not there anymore.

1824
01:26:19,470 --> 01:26:21,780
Yeah,
those cut blocks was gigantic chunks,

1825
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:23,310
but they kind of regulate that.
Right.

1826
01:26:23,311 --> 01:26:25,140
Like they only allow you to do it in 
certain spots.

1827
01:26:25,141 --> 01:26:26,490
Then they regrow them and.

1828
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:28,070
Well,
but they're regrowing Americans.

1829
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:30,330
It's the same thing with any sort of 
management.

1830
01:26:30,331 --> 01:26:35,010
Like they're being replanted with stuff.
It's going to be cut down into different

1831
01:26:35,011 --> 01:26:37,440
kinds of tree.
It's like a non native kind of tree.

1832
01:26:37,441 --> 01:26:39,000
It's the fast growing kind.
Right.

1833
01:26:39,001 --> 01:26:41,040
So I was trying to get it up and it's 
like a commodity,

1834
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:46,360
a commodity.
So get it planted and get it back up so 

1835
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:47,160
we can cut it down again.
But that old wood,

1836
01:26:47,250 --> 01:26:51,090
there's nothing like old growth.
It's just been around forever.

1837
01:26:51,510 --> 01:26:56,510
Yeah.
There's nothing like being in those 

1838
01:26:56,510 --> 01:26:57,681
forests to.
Because you really do get that sense 

1839
01:26:57,681 --> 01:27:00,381
that while this was here long before the
wheel or long before rather I'm the 

1840
01:27:00,381 --> 01:27:02,610
engine or long before boats came over 
here.

1841
01:27:02,611 --> 01:27:04,670
I mean this stuff out before the wheel.
Sixty zero,

1842
01:27:04,700 --> 01:27:05,730
6,000
year old trees,

1843
01:27:05,731 --> 01:27:06,970
right?
No.

1844
01:27:07,050 --> 01:27:08,790
So I don't think so.
What's the oldest tree?

1845
01:27:09,420 --> 01:27:10,460
I don't know.
Let's find out.

1846
01:27:11,020 --> 01:27:12,250
What do you guess?
If you had to guess,

1847
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:18,300
it'd be like a sequoia or a redwood or 
something.

1848
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:21,780
How old do you think it would be?
There's trees.

1849
01:27:21,781 --> 01:27:23,100
Whoa.
Methuselah,

1850
01:27:23,410 --> 01:27:28,410
a brittle cone.
Pine tree from California's white 

1851
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:29,010
mountains is thought to be 5,000
years old.

1852
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:34,950
The oldest non non conal will know what 
that means.

1853
01:27:35,370 --> 01:27:39,190
Non clonal tree in the world.
The exact location of the normal trusted

1854
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:40,170
is.
Oh,

1855
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:44,040
it's kept secret for its protection.
Huh?

1856
01:27:44,610 --> 01:27:49,610
There's a tree that people are so gross.
You have to not tell them where the old 

1857
01:27:49,610 --> 01:27:53,961
tree is because they'll go cut it down.
Smoking chair out of the tree.

1858
01:27:55,230 --> 01:28:00,230
Yeah.
Some asshole will go and use it to make 

1859
01:28:00,230 --> 01:28:00,230
his headboard.
That stupid tree.

1860
01:28:00,230 --> 01:28:01,500
Huh?
Five thousand years old.

1861
01:28:01,501 --> 01:28:04,590
So that's a good answer.
So that's a God damn old tree.

1862
01:28:05,670 --> 01:28:06,690
That's probably the wheel.

1863
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:08,820
And there's probably wheels circles all 
around it.

1864
01:28:08,910 --> 01:28:10,290
Yeah.
Yeah.

1865
01:28:11,020 --> 01:28:16,020
Um,
but that's just being around something 

1866
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:19,070
that predates most of human history.
Just knowing that this thing was a seed 

1867
01:28:19,861 --> 01:28:24,861
and that seed became this tree and it's 
just seeing this entire world changed 

1868
01:28:24,861 --> 01:28:29,481
during the time that it's been living 
and breathing in carbon dioxide and 

1869
01:28:29,481 --> 01:28:31,020
breathing out oxygen.
Very freaky.

1870
01:28:32,190 --> 01:28:37,190
That's something you get with old growth
trees that you're not going to get with 

1871
01:28:37,190 --> 01:28:40,080
those cut blocks that are reef 
refurbished with these new little shitty

1872
01:28:40,081 --> 01:28:43,110
pine trees that are little tags on them 
and stuff.

1873
01:28:43,140 --> 01:28:44,320
Yeah,
it's kind of fucked.

1874
01:28:44,670 --> 01:28:46,890
That's just a weird thing about people.
We just,

1875
01:28:46,891 --> 01:28:47,530
we,
we,

1876
01:28:47,610 --> 01:28:50,850
if we don't put regulations on stuff,
that's why it's really cool.

1877
01:28:50,851 --> 01:28:53,220
Like a place like a.
have you ever been to boulder,

1878
01:28:53,221 --> 01:28:58,221
Colorado?
They don't really allow people to build 

1879
01:28:58,221 --> 01:28:58,221
like the.
You don't see any apartment buildings in

1880
01:28:58,221 --> 01:29:02,220
the mountains you don't see like they,
they have a very strict amount

1881
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:07,250
of construction that they allow in and 
they're very strict about it and they 

1882
01:29:07,250 --> 01:29:11,310
buy up space on people of like spaced 
land that's for sale.

1883
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:16,340
Like Boulder County will actually buy 
that land and make sure that it remains 

1884
01:29:16,340 --> 01:29:17,010
open space.
So there'll be given ever build on it,

1885
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:21,630
be kind of have to do that.
Keep people from fucking the whole thing

1886
01:29:21,631 --> 01:29:22,290
up.
You know,

1887
01:29:23,630 --> 01:29:25,050
wonder why no one wants to go to Alaska.

1888
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:28,260
I think the last frontier,
there's some space up there.

1889
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:29,790
Yeah,
with everyone's scared of bears.

1890
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:31,380
That's true.
I'll ask.

1891
01:29:31,381 --> 01:29:33,310
It's freaky.
Alaska is the law.

1892
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:36,450
It's like the wild west.
It is like the wild west up there.

1893
01:29:36,630 --> 01:29:40,200
The people are really cool though.
Have you spent time in Alaska?

1894
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:42,890
No.
My husband had a big motorcycle trip.

1895
01:29:42,950 --> 01:29:47,950
They did like a big motorcycle trip.
I'm like all around there and they were 

1896
01:29:47,950 --> 01:29:48,860
just in some kind of back country and it
was like everyone here,

1897
01:29:48,861 --> 01:29:52,430
is this like hardy?
They are.

1898
01:29:52,460 --> 01:29:55,400
They are like the cowboy,
whatever that equivalent spirit is there

1899
01:29:55,401 --> 01:29:57,200
going there because there's this less 
rules,

1900
01:29:57,201 --> 01:29:59,660
more space,
more quiet.

1901
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:02,300
We went to the movies at midnight and it
was bright outside.

1902
01:30:03,190 --> 01:30:05,720
This is fucking strange.
It was in the middle of July.

1903
01:30:06,110 --> 01:30:07,370
It was really weird.
Like we,

1904
01:30:07,410 --> 01:30:09,830
we did a comedy show up there.
We got out of the show.

1905
01:30:09,831 --> 01:30:11,060
It was two,
3:00

1906
01:30:11,061 --> 01:30:12,470
in the morning.
Bright out,

1907
01:30:12,860 --> 01:30:17,860
see everything.
It's very strange and the people up 

1908
01:30:17,860 --> 01:30:20,771
there there are so it's like there's a 
as a sense of community,

1909
01:30:20,841 --> 01:30:25,841
even in the city like anchorage that you
don't really see in a lot of cities down

1910
01:30:26,061 --> 01:30:28,190
here because their reality is,
yeah,

1911
01:30:28,191 --> 01:30:31,310
well every now and then a moose comes 
into town and kicks the shit out of some

1912
01:30:31,311 --> 01:30:34,280
people at a supermarket or a bear 
attack.

1913
01:30:34,281 --> 01:30:37,540
Someone that's in the wrong place,
the wrong time or you know,

1914
01:30:37,550 --> 01:30:42,550
it's just the reality that they live in.
They all have to kind of band together 

1915
01:30:42,550 --> 01:30:44,270
because every now and then if you see a 
car broken down the side of the road,

1916
01:30:44,271 --> 01:30:46,880
like you get out and help that person 
because that could be you.

1917
01:30:46,930 --> 01:30:51,930
Right?
Whereas if you're leaving here and you 

1918
01:30:51,930 --> 01:30:51,930
get on the one on one,
you see some guy broken down,

1919
01:30:51,930 --> 01:30:54,350
you don't even think for a second,
let me pull over.

1920
01:30:54,650 --> 01:30:56,940
There's 100 million people drive by.
Wrong.

1921
01:30:57,590 --> 01:30:59,390
No one's thinking,
let me go help that guy.

1922
01:30:59,750 --> 01:31:02,960
But if you're in Alaska and that's the 
only car you've seen for 20 minutes,

1923
01:31:02,990 --> 01:31:04,370
you pull over.
Hey you okay?

1924
01:31:04,371 --> 01:31:06,080
Like what's going on?
Like you need a call,

1925
01:31:06,820 --> 01:31:11,820
it's a.
there's a sense of community because of 

1926
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:11,820
their harsh conditions because the 
environment they're in.

1927
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:12,990
Yeah,
you need people.

1928
01:31:13,130 --> 01:31:16,810
You really do need a tribal situation.
If you have,

1929
01:31:16,820 --> 01:31:18,750
you're spread out a little bit,
you know you have your,

1930
01:31:19,410 --> 01:31:24,410
your claim or your space,
but when you need help it's going to 

1931
01:31:25,351 --> 01:31:27,660
have to be some other person's gonna 
have to come help

1932
01:31:28,120 --> 01:31:31,960
but don't think it's kind of healthier 
to be in a place where there's like,

1933
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:34,480
you know,
the term diffusion of responsibility,

1934
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:39,520
the idea being that it's easier to 
attack someone in front of a thousand 

1935
01:31:39,790 --> 01:31:44,790
people than it is in front of one person
because one person feels obligated to 

1936
01:31:44,790 --> 01:31:48,241
help.
Whereas a thousand people say someone 

1937
01:31:48,241 --> 01:31:50,131
should jump in and do something but 
nobody does anything because they don't 

1938
01:31:50,131 --> 01:31:50,590
feel like they have to because there's 
so many other folks.

1939
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:56,040
Isn't that Kinda like what you get if 
you're in a big city as opposed to like 

1940
01:31:56,040 --> 01:31:58,440
maybe where you live or maybe Alaska or 
just a.

1941
01:31:58,441 --> 01:31:59,770
there's a,
there's a number

1942
01:32:00,310 --> 01:32:01,150
that's manageable.

1943
01:32:02,620 --> 01:32:03,580
Yeah,
I mean I,

1944
01:32:03,670 --> 01:32:05,860
I like,
I like the town that we live in.

1945
01:32:05,861 --> 01:32:08,180
I grew up in a small town and then I've 
been,

1946
01:32:08,220 --> 01:32:13,220
I was in southern California for a long 
time and it never really felt connected 

1947
01:32:13,220 --> 01:32:17,191
as easiest word,
but now that I'm out there in a little 

1948
01:32:17,191 --> 01:32:17,590
bit more rugged or wilderness,
you know,

1949
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:18,760
I,
I,

1950
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:21,280
I,
I feel I feel safe,

1951
01:32:21,340 --> 01:32:26,340
safe knowing that there are neighbors or
community members,

1952
01:32:27,220 --> 01:32:28,960
I feel more,
more safe there.

1953
01:32:28,961 --> 01:32:31,630
I think that I feel in the big city.

1954
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:34,740
Yeah,
totally makes sense.

1955
01:32:34,950 --> 01:32:35,420
Uh,
yeah.

1956
01:32:35,460 --> 01:32:37,560
I think big cities are a new thing,
you know,

1957
01:32:37,650 --> 01:32:40,260
as far as human beings,
like our DNA,

1958
01:32:40,330 --> 01:32:42,210
we've only had them for a few hundred 
years.

1959
01:32:43,850 --> 01:32:44,960
Yeah.
What's the biggest city?

1960
01:32:45,820 --> 01:32:49,440
It's probably something in China,
like as far as population wise,

1961
01:32:50,130 --> 01:32:53,910
I mean la is kind of huge,
but it's really spread out.

1962
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:56,040
It's not.
I mean it's a city,

1963
01:32:56,041 --> 01:32:58,320
but it's a weird thing.
It's like a giant suburb,

1964
01:32:58,730 --> 01:33:03,730
you know,
the look at the city aspect of La you 

1965
01:33:03,730 --> 01:33:05,070
got like downtown La is what we think of
as a city,

1966
01:33:05,071 --> 01:33:06,600
but because of the fact that there's 
earthquakes,

1967
01:33:06,601 --> 01:33:11,601
everything is only one level out here 
are two levels at most except for 

1968
01:33:11,601 --> 01:33:12,840
downtown and you have a few office 
buildings here and there,

1969
01:33:12,841 --> 01:33:16,950
but if you look at the landscape,
it's a lot of like flat things.

1970
01:33:17,910 --> 01:33:21,030
I would say probably the biggest is like
Singapore or something like that.

1971
01:33:21,031 --> 01:33:21,310
What is it?

1972
01:33:21,390 --> 01:33:24,690
Hong Delhi.
India has got at least 25 million.

1973
01:33:25,850 --> 01:33:28,950
Do you know your neighbors really well?
My neighbor is a Douche bag.

1974
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:30,300
So you do.

1975
01:33:32,060 --> 01:33:33,440
I know one neighbor,
uh,

1976
01:33:33,441 --> 01:33:38,441
I know a couple neighbors.
There's a few people that live on my 

1977
01:33:38,441 --> 01:33:38,441
block that I know that I'm friendly 
with.

1978
01:33:38,441 --> 01:33:38,441
It's wet.
People know,

1979
01:33:38,441 --> 01:33:43,321
go outside.
I think that it might even be like less 

1980
01:33:43,321 --> 01:33:45,771
about numbers and more about how many 
people go outside or not because it 

1981
01:33:45,771 --> 01:33:46,170
seems to me like in,
in big cities,

1982
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:50,160
um,
w or even suburbs of big cities,

1983
01:33:50,161 --> 01:33:52,080
like everyone is pulled their car to 
their garage.

1984
01:33:52,081 --> 01:33:55,680
They close their garage and then they're
in their house and then um,

1985
01:33:55,830 --> 01:33:58,110
if they're outside,
they're in their backyard with her,

1986
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:03,320
you know,
small family that there's not these 

1987
01:34:03,320 --> 01:34:03,420
large communities of people that are 
interacting outside.

1988
01:34:03,421 --> 01:34:07,800
So maybe maybe you could have that kind 
of that safety or you know,

1989
01:34:07,801 --> 01:34:12,801
everyone taking responsibility for 
people that you live with because you 

1990
01:34:12,801 --> 01:34:16,431
consider yourself living with them 
because you see them and you're next to 

1991
01:34:16,431 --> 01:34:17,940
them in some,
in some place.

1992
01:34:17,941 --> 01:34:20,160
But I'm like,
if you're in Alaska,

1993
01:34:20,161 --> 01:34:24,720
I imagine that even if you were in your,
even if you're up there by yourself,

1994
01:34:24,721 --> 01:34:28,200
you're still spending so much time 
outside because you still have to get so

1995
01:34:28,201 --> 01:34:32,820
much for yourself I imagine or just get 
out to go pick it up wherever it's being

1996
01:34:32,821 --> 01:34:33,540
shipped in.

1997
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:35,190
Well,
there's definitely that.

1998
01:34:35,191 --> 01:34:40,191
It's much more expensive to get things 
up there and get food and groceries and 

1999
01:34:40,191 --> 01:34:42,510
things along those lines.
Especially the more rural you get,

2000
01:34:42,540 --> 01:34:44,670
the more problematic it is to get things
delivered.

2001
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:45,890
No.
Um,

2002
01:34:46,060 --> 01:34:49,110
when I say my neighbors a Douche bag or 
something bad guys just kind of goofy,

2003
01:34:49,380 --> 01:34:52,050
but there's some people in my 
neighborhood that are very cool,

2004
01:34:52,051 --> 01:34:53,060
like,
you know,

2005
01:34:53,070 --> 01:34:55,260
I see them and it's nice.
It's nice to have a community where,

2006
01:34:55,261 --> 01:34:57,000
you know,
you go up the street and you see,

2007
01:34:57,410 --> 01:34:58,250
hey man,
what's going on?

2008
01:34:58,251 --> 01:34:59,330
What are you doing?
You're still working on that.

2009
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:00,410
Oh that's cool.
Blah Blah Blah.

2010
01:35:00,770 --> 01:35:03,530
So it's nice like you have like this 
little sort of relationship with.

2011
01:35:03,531 --> 01:35:08,531
But I didn't choose these people.
I just moved in and I got lucky that 

2012
01:35:08,531 --> 01:35:11,090
some of them were okay and became 
friends with some along the way.

2013
01:35:11,090 --> 01:35:16,090
But it's like ideally I've always said 
the really smart thing to do would be 

2014
01:35:16,090 --> 01:35:17,360
get together with all your friends and 
loved ones and say,

2015
01:35:17,361 --> 01:35:19,040
Hey,
let's all live in this area.

2016
01:35:19,490 --> 01:35:22,640
Let's all move to this one street.
Is that possible to do like,

2017
01:35:22,641 --> 01:35:25,340
let's get the other.
But nobody ever really does that.

2018
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:30,400
They always say like,
I've had 15 of those conversations with 

2019
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:33,221
my friends and with my friend Brian.
He just moved out in my neighborhood 

2020
01:35:33,221 --> 01:35:33,221
didn't.
And I'm like,

2021
01:35:33,221 --> 01:35:33,221
come,
come,

2022
01:35:33,221 --> 01:35:37,780
come look on my block.
And it's like fucking guy moved like 10 

2023
01:35:37,780 --> 01:35:37,780
miles away.
I'm like,

2024
01:35:37,780 --> 01:35:41,231
why did you move over there dummy?
Oh my wife looks to be close to the 

2025
01:35:41,231 --> 01:35:41,270
grocery store,
like fucking grocery store.

2026
01:35:41,271 --> 01:35:46,271
You're going to get in your car anyway.
Dummy isn't getting you car for 30 

2027
01:35:46,271 --> 01:35:47,450
seconds or three minutes.
Is it really that much of a difference?

2028
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:53,000
And it maybe that was the idea like with
neighborhoods that you would be living 

2029
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:53,000
with people like,
you know,

2030
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,040
you're all going the same place for work
and everyone goes to same school and.

2031
01:35:55,430 --> 01:35:57,230
But now your neighborhood is just full 
of all.

2032
01:35:57,460 --> 01:35:59,870
Like it's such a,
it's such a transient time.

2033
01:35:59,871 --> 01:36:01,160
And,
and also big houses,

2034
01:36:01,161 --> 01:36:02,360
I think,
you know,

2035
01:36:02,361 --> 01:36:07,361
I'm in New York,
I have friends who they go out to eat 

2036
01:36:07,361 --> 01:36:10,991
for most of their meals right there.
Houses are large and so they're forced 

2037
01:36:10,991 --> 01:36:12,020
by lack of space.
Again,

2038
01:36:12,021 --> 01:36:17,021
it's kind of one of those space things 
where you have to go out and commune 

2039
01:36:17,021 --> 01:36:21,431
with other people and you have your 
seven favorite places and then by 

2040
01:36:21,431 --> 01:36:21,900
default those became.
Come,

2041
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:24,770
you're a little community,
but here you can.

2042
01:36:24,860 --> 01:36:27,200
You can sustain yourself entirely within
your,

2043
01:36:27,590 --> 01:36:29,870
your house,
your compound,

2044
01:36:29,871 --> 01:36:33,050
and it's just made it so we don't have 
to really interact with anyone anymore.

2045
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:39,000
That's a big thing with people.
They like to be sustained and they like 

2046
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,150
to have all of their stuff that they 
need.

2047
01:36:40,151 --> 01:36:40,770
I mean,
that's what.

2048
01:36:40,860 --> 01:36:42,340
That's the prepper instinct,
right?

2049
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:47,400
I've got enough food here for a year,
like everybody's got this idea that if 

2050
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:47,470
the shit goes down,
I'm going to be fine.

2051
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:51,160
I'm going to just start piling.
Just have a gun turret on my roof,

2052
01:36:51,161 --> 01:36:53,780
I'm going to be fine,
but I live in,

2053
01:36:53,781 --> 01:36:57,580
in New York City I think is the worst 
case scenario because people like I have

2054
01:36:57,581 --> 01:36:59,800
a friend who lives in New York.
You can't even put his golf clubs in his

2055
01:36:59,801 --> 01:37:00,970
apartment.
He's got no room.

2056
01:37:00,971 --> 01:37:05,971
He used to put it all in storage,
so if he wants to play golf is to go to 

2057
01:37:05,971 --> 01:37:09,031
the storage place and open up his little
spot with a key and go in and get as 

2058
01:37:09,281 --> 01:37:10,600
junk and like,
oh,

2059
01:37:11,260 --> 01:37:13,510
what are you doing?
Like you're living in a box.

2060
01:37:13,860 --> 01:37:18,860
Yeah.
My Post apocalypto is less about 

2061
01:37:18,860 --> 01:37:18,860
hoarding,
you know,

2062
01:37:18,860 --> 01:37:18,960
like food or whatever.
It more about assembling a team.

2063
01:37:19,230 --> 01:37:22,980
Like I'm looking for skill sets because 
a skill set you can take on the road and

2064
01:37:23,130 --> 01:37:26,220
produce something with that skill set 
that is necessary.

2065
01:37:26,221 --> 01:37:31,221
So I don't really care how much what you
got in your garage or how much canned 

2066
01:37:31,221 --> 01:37:35,661
food you have.
I care about like show me how fast you 

2067
01:37:35,661 --> 01:37:35,661
can clean a fish who can make medicine 
on herbs.

2068
01:37:35,661 --> 01:37:37,010
Like that's,
that's kind of more my.

2069
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:39,340
That's those are the applications taking
now.

2070
01:37:39,550 --> 01:37:41,360
Sonata herbs,
any medicine,

2071
01:37:41,361 --> 01:37:43,880
any good that you can make other herbs 
you just laying around.

2072
01:37:43,940 --> 01:37:45,140
Sure.
What have you ever made?

2073
01:37:45,740 --> 01:37:47,570
Well,
I mean there are,

2074
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:49,300
there's all sorts of things you can make
an artist.

2075
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:50,690
Can you make a mud pack?
I do.

2076
01:37:50,691 --> 01:37:55,691
You know,
do you know of the things that are in 

2077
01:37:55,691 --> 01:37:56,460
nature that you can,
that you can take?

2078
01:37:56,461 --> 01:37:57,570
What can you eat?
What's edible?

2079
01:37:58,870 --> 01:38:00,600
Like basic stuff like that.
Like what?

2080
01:38:00,601 --> 01:38:05,601
What is out here that people have known 
about for forever that no one knows 

2081
01:38:05,821 --> 01:38:06,960
about anymore?
Like how,

2082
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:12,040
how much of people,
how many Irish people started with the 

2083
01:38:12,040 --> 01:38:14,241
potato famine because no one knew 
anything about the plants that were 

2084
01:38:14,241 --> 01:38:14,850
sitting right there that they could have
sustained themselves on the entire time.

2085
01:38:15,380 --> 01:38:18,030
Sure.
Eaten plenty of edible stuff.

2086
01:38:18,090 --> 01:38:20,970
They just didn't have the thing that 
they had always eaten beforehand.

2087
01:38:21,660 --> 01:38:22,410
Really?
Sure.

2088
01:38:22,740 --> 01:38:27,740
That seems like ridiculous.
There's plenty of food mass there to 

2089
01:38:27,740 --> 01:38:28,800
eat,
but if the skill set is gone,

2090
01:38:28,801 --> 01:38:33,801
then it's really easy to kill yourself.
Trying to figure it out for the first 

2091
01:38:33,801 --> 01:38:33,801
time.

2092
01:38:33,801 --> 01:38:36,980
I'm sure you've seen survivor man.
You've seen that show less drought duck.

2093
01:38:36,990 --> 01:38:41,990
I opened my eyes for watching that show.
Watching how easy it is to not get food 

2094
01:38:42,230 --> 01:38:43,240
like you think,
wow.

2095
01:38:43,241 --> 01:38:48,241
The guys in the woods,
plenty of stuff to eat out there and 

2096
01:38:48,241 --> 01:38:50,221
they seemed like foraging for food and 
trying to figure out how to like kill a 

2097
01:38:50,221 --> 01:38:53,821
squirrel with some sort of a rock that 
drops a little thing that he hits the 

2098
01:38:53,821 --> 01:38:55,990
switch and the rock falls on his head.
Yeah.

2099
01:38:56,010 --> 01:38:57,730
Not so good.
It doesn't really work that well.

2100
01:38:58,270 --> 01:39:03,270
Who is that guy that John?
Is it John mcclane is the guy who went 

2101
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:04,570
out in the woods and then died in the 
bus.

2102
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:09,960
They made a movie out of it into the 
wild so that everyone's like the 

2103
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:10,410
hypothesizing about like his,
you know,

2104
01:39:10,420 --> 01:39:11,410
his death and like,
oh,

2105
01:39:11,411 --> 01:39:16,411
he must've eaten this particular 
planning got poisoned and all the wild 

2106
01:39:16,411 --> 01:39:17,050
food experts aren't so he starved to 
death.

2107
01:39:17,110 --> 01:39:18,460
It's very simple.
He starved,

2108
01:39:18,810 --> 01:39:21,670
he starved himself to death.
Like one of the reasons humans have such

2109
01:39:21,671 --> 01:39:26,671
a long juvenile period compared to any 
other primate is getting food is hard 

2110
01:39:27,131 --> 01:39:29,890
and it takes a really long time to be 
taught how to get it.

2111
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:33,730
Like to have this information handed 
down into to get the skill,

2112
01:39:33,731 --> 01:39:38,731
the muscle if you will,
to be able to do it and you expend so 

2113
01:39:38,731 --> 01:39:42,631
much energy trying to get it that you 
have to eat not only to cover that 

2114
01:39:42,631 --> 01:39:45,610
energy but enough to go beyond beyond 
that a little bit.

2115
01:39:45,611 --> 01:39:46,690
And then if you're,
you know,

2116
01:39:46,720 --> 01:39:51,720
making kids or whatever,
then there's all this extra stuff and 

2117
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:53,050
it's very hard and no one has ever done 
it ever.

2118
01:39:53,510 --> 01:39:58,510
Yeah.
We really got soft when it comes to 

2119
01:39:58,510 --> 01:40:00,751
that,
the ability to feed yourself without a 

2120
01:40:00,751 --> 01:40:02,890
supermarket.
It's very monumentally difficult task to

2121
01:40:02,891 --> 01:40:07,891
do for the average person.
That movie really pissed me off because 

2122
01:40:07,891 --> 01:40:11,880
they twisted the into the wild.
They twisted the ending because in the 

2123
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:14,740
movie he eats a poisonous plant and he 
gets sick and he dies.

2124
01:40:14,741 --> 01:40:19,490
He missed misidentified as the wrong 
plant and his liver toxic and he dies.

2125
01:40:19,491 --> 01:40:24,491
Right?
But the reality is he did starve to 

2126
01:40:24,491 --> 01:40:24,491
death because it's fucking hard to get 
food,

2127
01:40:24,491 --> 01:40:28,710
right?
Like if you've ever gone hunting like 

2128
01:40:28,710 --> 01:40:30,690
this.
One of the things that my friend Brian 

2129
01:40:30,690 --> 01:40:31,660
Count and I first realized the first 
hunting trip that we went on.

2130
01:40:31,661 --> 01:40:36,661
Lucky we went with this guy,
Steve Rinella is his famous hunter and 

2131
01:40:36,661 --> 01:40:36,661
we.
But we're like Jesus,

2132
01:40:36,661 --> 01:40:38,830
like how the fuck did they do this 
before they had guns?

2133
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:44,240
Like we have guns and it's hard.
We have guns and scopes and binoculars 

2134
01:40:44,891 --> 01:40:48,880
and a trained hunter and we know the 
territory and we have,

2135
01:40:49,210 --> 01:40:54,160
we have a tags which like,
so they know there's in the area,

2136
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:58,690
there's all these like things that are 
on our side and it's still a fucking for

2137
01:40:58,691 --> 01:41:02,080
days with no success.
I feel like if you didn't have food with

2138
01:41:02,081 --> 01:41:04,660
you and you were going on these days 
with no success,

2139
01:41:04,661 --> 01:41:08,020
you would be fucked.
Like you would start.

2140
01:41:08,050 --> 01:41:13,050
Like.
It could be really easy to starve to 

2141
01:41:13,050 --> 01:41:13,050
death.
Like real.

2142
01:41:13,050 --> 01:41:14,110
That's with a gun.
Like with a gun.

2143
01:41:14,111 --> 01:41:19,111
It's easy to start without a gun.
When you hear about someone that's like 

2144
01:41:19,111 --> 01:41:20,950
survived in the woods by themselves for 
like 20 years,

2145
01:41:20,951 --> 01:41:23,050
like eating frogs and shit.
You like what?

2146
01:41:23,620 --> 01:41:25,830
How did that guy do it?
Like that?

2147
01:41:25,880 --> 01:41:28,180
To be like touch and go almost everyday.

2148
01:41:28,510 --> 01:41:30,830
Very few stockpiles.
Very.

2149
01:41:30,910 --> 01:41:32,920
Let me.
How much can you store?

2150
01:41:33,070 --> 01:41:38,070
You can only store like a couple days 
worth of vegetables or plant matter 

2151
01:41:38,070 --> 01:41:41,590
before that starts to go bad meat 
depending on the temperature.

2152
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:44,530
Usually only good for.
Unless it's freezing cold out,

2153
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:49,560
you know,
it's not good for more than a couple of 

2154
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:50,050
days like you.
You have to constantly be on the move,

2155
01:41:50,410 --> 01:41:55,410
which is why cities weren't really 
figured out until we figured out how 

2156
01:41:55,410 --> 01:41:55,960
stockpile shit.
Once they fail,

2157
01:41:56,110 --> 01:41:58,270
stockpile shit and like,
okay,

2158
01:41:58,271 --> 01:42:00,190
we have a,
a grain silo,

2159
01:42:00,191 --> 01:42:01,420
we have enough food for a week.
Hey,

2160
01:42:01,421 --> 01:42:04,870
somebody should invent a way to make 
music out of a box.

2161
01:42:04,900 --> 01:42:06,070
You know,
let's make a piano.

2162
01:42:06,110 --> 01:42:07,930
Like all that much of free time on her 
hands.

2163
01:42:08,620 --> 01:42:09,670
Yeah,
yeah.

2164
01:42:09,671 --> 01:42:10,160
No,
it's.

2165
01:42:10,270 --> 01:42:15,270
That is the container container.
I think of container free life is kind 

2166
01:42:15,911 --> 01:42:17,440
of like my,
my goal,

2167
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:22,560
but isn't it kind of a catch 22?
It's like you need society and culture 

2168
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:24,700
in order to figure out how to make a 
computer,

2169
01:42:24,701 --> 01:42:27,310
which allows you to learn about how to 
live in the wild.

2170
01:42:29,530 --> 01:42:31,030
You know what I mean?
You need,

2171
01:42:31,390 --> 01:42:36,390
you need education in order to figure 
out what's going wrong with the human 

2172
01:42:36,791 --> 01:42:41,791
body,
by living in this sedentary lifestyle 

2173
01:42:41,791 --> 01:42:45,030
that you have to go through this 
sedentary lifestyle to get that 

2174
01:42:45,030 --> 01:42:48,511
education,
to figure out that it's not good for 

2175
01:42:48,511 --> 01:42:48,511
you.
Yeah.

2176
01:42:48,511 --> 01:42:48,511
Well we've been in.
Again,

2177
01:42:48,511 --> 01:42:52,840
I mean that's what I could.
Damien is like we're stockpiling 

2178
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:53,660
information right,
and now we've got to figure out a way to

2179
01:42:53,661 --> 01:42:57,670
distribute it so it requires a whole new
society.

2180
01:42:57,680 --> 01:42:59,670
Like that's part of what civilization is
to,

2181
01:42:59,671 --> 01:43:04,671
is,
is someone knows something that you 

2182
01:43:04,671 --> 01:43:06,611
don't know and that you might want to 
know that you find valuable so you can 

2183
01:43:06,611 --> 01:43:07,970
go do some of his work for him.
So he'll tell you.

2184
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:12,130
Do you think that ultimately the,
the pattern that most people have chosen

2185
01:43:12,131 --> 01:43:15,760
this like nine to five in a box and then
still sat in the car drive,

2186
01:43:15,820 --> 01:43:19,330
is that going to be,
do you think will will realize somewhere

2187
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:24,600
down the line that that likes smoking is
like really bad for you and we should 

2188
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:28,831
try to phase that out and try to.
Or do you think we're so caught up in 

2189
01:43:28,831 --> 01:43:29,590
this idea of achievement and,
and our,

2190
01:43:29,750 --> 01:43:34,750
our momentum is so in that direction 
that will never pull away from it?

2191
01:43:35,170 --> 01:43:35,170
I,

2192
01:43:35,880 --> 01:43:36,600
no,
I think,

2193
01:43:36,690 --> 01:43:38,160
I think that we will.
I mean,

2194
01:43:38,161 --> 01:43:39,200
I think that,
uh,

2195
01:43:39,340 --> 01:43:44,340
like you with European countries playing
around with things like four day work 

2196
01:43:44,340 --> 01:43:45,160
weeks,
you know,

2197
01:43:45,170 --> 01:43:47,790
how,
how much work it doesn't take as much as

2198
01:43:47,791 --> 01:43:52,791
much time as you're going to work.
You're probably not working at some 

2199
01:43:52,791 --> 01:43:52,791
point.
Someone I

2200
01:43:52,791 --> 01:43:56,980
hope is going to stand up and say I 
could do my job like in three hours a 

2201
01:43:56,980 --> 01:43:57,870
day.
And I think um,

2202
01:43:57,920 --> 01:43:59,770
as people are,
you know,

2203
01:43:59,771 --> 01:44:01,040
as,
as businesses are laying off,

2204
01:44:01,041 --> 01:44:03,500
people are doing enforced furloughs,
you know,

2205
01:44:03,530 --> 01:44:08,530
where they're saying,
well you now have four days to get the 

2206
01:44:08,530 --> 01:44:10,580
same job done and you're gonna have to 
take a 20 percent pay cut.

2207
01:44:10,581 --> 01:44:13,760
I think people are accepting that 
because now they get this extra day.

2208
01:44:13,761 --> 01:44:16,070
They're actually better for it.
They might have less money,

2209
01:44:16,520 --> 01:44:17,660
but at home,
you know,

2210
01:44:18,110 --> 01:44:23,110
I think that if you've had some health 
issues usually end up valuing your 

2211
01:44:23,110 --> 01:44:24,530
health a little bit more.
It's always after,

2212
01:44:24,620 --> 01:44:27,260
I don't know if the up and comers will 
see it that way,

2213
01:44:27,530 --> 01:44:32,530
but then for the up and comers,
there's not a lot of jobs for those up 

2214
01:44:32,530 --> 01:44:33,260
and comers.
There's not even,

2215
01:44:33,261 --> 01:44:37,310
there's not even the option for nine to 
five work for so many people now who did

2216
01:44:37,311 --> 01:44:38,420
what they were supposed to do,
you know,

2217
01:44:38,421 --> 01:44:41,510
when they went to school or whatever and
they got a trade or a job,

2218
01:44:41,511 --> 01:44:43,730
like there's no place for them,
so then they're going,

2219
01:44:43,731 --> 01:44:46,520
well I'll go back to school and try to 
get a better job.

2220
01:44:46,520 --> 01:44:49,130
So I think everything.
I think everything we're to transition,

2221
01:44:49,190 --> 01:44:54,190
a lot of things are gonna change and I 
think the work day in general with the 

2222
01:44:54,190 --> 01:44:55,330
commute,
with the like digital commute,

2223
01:44:55,340 --> 01:44:59,180
people being able to work from their 
computers wherever they are.

2224
01:44:59,181 --> 01:45:01,910
Eventually corporations will see that 
it's cheaper.

2225
01:45:02,030 --> 01:45:04,820
The cheaper for them to still make the 
same products,

2226
01:45:06,050 --> 01:45:08,240
paying people less,
but people get more free time.

2227
01:45:08,910 --> 01:45:13,910
Yeah,
but people are always going to want 

2228
01:45:13,910 --> 01:45:13,910
more.
That's the thing.

2229
01:45:13,910 --> 01:45:14,100
It's like,
I think if you could tell someone,

2230
01:45:14,101 --> 01:45:19,101
hey,
I can do the same job for three hours a 

2231
01:45:19,101 --> 01:45:19,280
day,
they will be like good.

2232
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:20,310
That way.
I saved money.

2233
01:45:20,420 --> 01:45:20,840
Like,
no,

2234
01:45:20,850 --> 01:45:23,430
but we don't doing the same job.
If I'm doing the same job,

2235
01:45:23,460 --> 01:45:25,200
you're making the same amount of money.
Yeah,

2236
01:45:25,201 --> 01:45:27,750
but you only working three hours a day,
eight hours a day,

2237
01:45:27,751 --> 01:45:32,751
but I'm getting the same shit done,
but we don't really reward people sort 

2238
01:45:32,751 --> 01:45:33,350
of.
Well,

2239
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:38,360
some jobs do,
but most jobs it's about the amount of 

2240
01:45:38,360 --> 01:45:38,360
hours you put in.

2241
01:45:38,360 --> 01:45:42,230
Yeah,
well I think that that person know who 

2242
01:45:42,230 --> 01:45:42,420
said I can do it in three hours a day is
going to be replaced by someone who does

2243
01:45:42,750 --> 01:45:47,750
like you'll just keep working.
You'll find someone who can do the job 

2244
01:45:47,750 --> 01:45:52,460
faster and for less,
and the only thing keeping people who 

2245
01:45:52,460 --> 01:45:55,770
don't do that in their seats is a maybe 
the law at a certain point.

2246
01:45:55,771 --> 01:46:00,771
Like if who you can fire and who you 
can't fire if people are tenured or or 

2247
01:46:00,771 --> 01:46:02,550
whatever that.
Hasn't that been the transition for like

2248
01:46:02,551 --> 01:46:07,551
the last 30 or 40 years where you're 
just paying people less relatively 

2249
01:46:07,551 --> 01:46:07,860
speaking,
you know,

2250
01:46:07,861 --> 01:46:09,960
the dollar is,
is different than what it was,

2251
01:46:09,961 --> 01:46:12,030
but aren't we paying people less who are
working?

2252
01:46:12,120 --> 01:46:17,120
Wait.
Like who doesn't work like seven days a 

2253
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:19,551
week who goes home and doesn't still 
have their email on and still answering 

2254
01:46:19,551 --> 01:46:20,760
emails.
I think that they're getting.

2255
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:24,930
I think that they're getting a lot more 
work out of people for what they used to

2256
01:46:24,931 --> 01:46:26,820
pay and that the fact they are paying 
people less.

2257
01:46:27,030 --> 01:46:32,030
That is an issue.
I have a friend who has an issue with 

2258
01:46:32,030 --> 01:46:34,050
his work because once he's done working 
he will not answer emails.

2259
01:46:34,590 --> 01:46:35,790
He's like,
when I'm done,

2260
01:46:35,850 --> 01:46:40,850
I'm done and he's,
he's successful enough so that you can 

2261
01:46:40,850 --> 01:46:44,151
kind of pull this off,
but it's a real issue that we were 

2262
01:46:44,151 --> 01:46:44,151
trying to reach you all day.
He's like,

2263
01:46:44,151 --> 01:46:45,000
I was done.
I'm done working.

2264
01:46:45,240 --> 01:46:50,240
When I'm done,
I shut my email off and I go places 

2265
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:50,240
without cell phone service and like,

2266
01:46:50,420 --> 01:46:51,300
you know,
he's like,

2267
01:46:51,301 --> 01:46:51,930
well,
what's going on?

2268
01:46:51,931 --> 01:46:53,670
Am I working for you guys 24 hours a 
day?

2269
01:46:53,730 --> 01:46:58,730
Like,
like if they send him an email at like 

2270
01:46:58,730 --> 01:46:58,730
10:00
at night,

2271
01:46:58,730 --> 01:46:58,730
they get upset if you respond to it in 
the morning,

2272
01:46:58,840 --> 01:47:00,420
like I sent you this at 10:00
at night.

2273
01:47:00,630 --> 01:47:01,620
He's like,
fuck you.

2274
01:47:01,810 --> 01:47:02,240
Fuck,
okay.

2275
01:47:02,241 --> 01:47:03,370
You don't own me.
Right?

2276
01:47:03,420 --> 01:47:04,530
This is,
this is what we're doing.

2277
01:47:04,531 --> 01:47:09,140
I mean he's in a weird position because 
he's a without outing him.

2278
01:47:09,270 --> 01:47:14,270
He's a big wig so his,
his situation is very strange but his 

2279
01:47:14,341 --> 01:47:17,940
stance is not.
His stance is like the stance that a lot

2280
01:47:17,941 --> 01:47:19,890
of people would like to take.
Like when the fucking day is over,

2281
01:47:19,891 --> 01:47:24,891
it's over.
You don't own me all through the night 

2282
01:47:24,891 --> 01:47:27,111
with email,
but that's like sort of creeped into 

2283
01:47:27,111 --> 01:47:27,111
people's life space.
Yeah.

2284
01:47:27,170 --> 01:47:32,170
Yeah.
Do you ever work with a company like 

2285
01:47:32,170 --> 01:47:32,170
Zephyr company ever come to you and 
said,

2286
01:47:32,170 --> 01:47:36,021
hey,
like we would like to ultimately like 

2287
01:47:36,021 --> 01:47:37,170
from the beginning of our company would 
like to engineer this thing to be like a

2288
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:42,200
healthier environment for our employees.
Like what is a way we can get the most 

2289
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:46,281
amount of productivity,
but also keep people as healthy as 

2290
01:47:46,281 --> 01:47:49,071
possible and give them an environment 
that's more conducive to just being an 

2291
01:47:50,401 --> 01:47:51,870
active healthy person.

2292
01:47:52,340 --> 01:47:53,420
Yeah,
sure.

2293
01:47:53,450 --> 01:47:56,060
You know like what are the.
I mean there are simple,

2294
01:47:56,210 --> 01:48:01,210
simple things that people can do.
Employers can do to provide their 

2295
01:48:01,210 --> 01:48:03,320
employees with a healthier version,
I guess of what?

2296
01:48:03,380 --> 01:48:06,290
Of the nine to five.
You don't have to sit like roving desks.

2297
01:48:06,291 --> 01:48:07,160
That was a big one.
Not,

2298
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:12,360
not having everyone at the same desk.
It's like going into the same desk every

2299
01:48:13,970 --> 01:48:16,730
single day is an issue.
It's an environmental killer.

2300
01:48:16,731 --> 01:48:19,160
Like you're looking at the same wall.
You're looking in the same.

2301
01:48:19,240 --> 01:48:23,930
Put our go to picture my daughter more 
worried for you and there's my golf club

2302
01:48:23,931 --> 01:48:28,931
Monaco.
More thing I put here about the things 

2303
01:48:28,931 --> 01:48:30,270
like you just are just so attached to 
their people working.

2304
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:35,320
Yeah.
What keeps you working as buying new 

2305
01:48:35,320 --> 01:48:35,320
shit?
Know,

2306
01:48:35,320 --> 01:48:35,400
like the thing at the end of the week 
I'm going to get that purse.

2307
01:48:35,401 --> 01:48:38,900
Woo.
That watch I've got my eye on you.

2308
01:48:39,740 --> 01:48:41,280
That's what keeps you going.
Otherwise I'm like,

2309
01:48:41,281 --> 01:48:43,290
why the fuck am I doing this?
Especially jobs,

2310
01:48:43,291 --> 01:48:45,570
they don't like.
Rewards are critical.

2311
01:48:46,830 --> 01:48:47,100
Right?

2312
01:48:47,210 --> 01:48:52,210
But then it turns out that they don't 
even like the reward that much because 

2313
01:48:52,210 --> 01:48:52,400
it's just onto the next reward.
How do we fix this?

2314
01:48:52,401 --> 01:48:56,050
Can I have a community that I am taking 
up?

2315
01:48:56,090 --> 01:48:59,740
Okay.
She was opening a call your community up

2316
01:48:59,741 --> 01:49:01,280
north?
Yeah.

2317
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:02,520
Take applications for you.

2318
01:49:02,920 --> 01:49:03,350
Well,
um,

2319
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:06,250
I have applications or for my poke post 
apocalypto team,

2320
01:49:06,300 --> 01:49:08,560
but yeah,
really banking on that.

2321
01:49:08,830 --> 01:49:10,030
Well,
you know what it is.

2322
01:49:10,031 --> 01:49:11,830
I just,
I really feel like I,

2323
01:49:11,950 --> 01:49:13,690
I,
it's like with shoes,

2324
01:49:13,700 --> 01:49:15,970
I wear regular shoes my whole entire 
life.

2325
01:49:15,971 --> 01:49:20,971
And then you switched to something 
minimal and you didn't even know how 

2326
01:49:20,971 --> 01:49:20,971
they,
how your feet were feeling all day long.

2327
01:49:20,971 --> 01:49:25,861
It's very hard to sense how something is
limiting you until you take yourself out

2328
01:49:27,581 --> 01:49:28,960
and away from it.
It's like going camping.

2329
01:49:28,961 --> 01:49:32,500
Like everyone feels better when they go 
camping and they're out hiking.

2330
01:49:32,501 --> 01:49:33,670
It's like,
I feel so good.

2331
01:49:33,671 --> 01:49:36,220
This thing that I had this chronic 
headache,

2332
01:49:36,221 --> 01:49:37,900
this vision problem,
the,

2333
01:49:37,901 --> 01:49:40,330
this irritation with my family or 
whatever it is.

2334
01:49:40,331 --> 01:49:43,570
When you go outside and you can't,
like all of a sudden it's different.

2335
01:49:43,571 --> 01:49:48,571
You've,
you've changed it up enough where it's 

2336
01:49:48,571 --> 01:49:48,571
different.

2337
01:49:48,571 --> 01:49:51,550
Well,
I feel like that indoors now after being

2338
01:49:51,551 --> 01:49:53,310
outside so much,
um,

2339
01:49:53,340 --> 01:49:56,740
after spending so much time,
I'm like,

2340
01:49:56,741 --> 01:50:01,390
I can feel this chair right now.
I haven't sat in a chair continuously in

2341
01:50:01,391 --> 01:50:04,870
probably two years.
This was the only time you've sat.

2342
01:50:04,871 --> 01:50:06,040
Now I don't have furniture.
I'm like,

2343
01:50:06,041 --> 01:50:07,060
I got rid of my couch.
Right?

2344
01:50:07,061 --> 01:50:11,060
So we should.
I know now you know,

2345
01:50:11,580 --> 01:50:14,200
this show just took a turn.
You're a crazy person.

2346
01:50:14,201 --> 01:50:19,201
You have a couch and don't have a couch 
and watch netflix sitting on the floor 

2347
01:50:19,201 --> 01:50:24,001
in front of my laptop.
You sit on a floor like some sort of 

2348
01:50:24,001 --> 01:50:25,690
barbarian for real,
for real.

2349
01:50:26,740 --> 01:50:29,300
Do you have cable tv at home or you just
one of those Weirdos?

2350
01:50:29,740 --> 01:50:31,570
Weirdos.
I get everything in.

2351
01:50:31,571 --> 01:50:32,980
I mean,
I like Netflix and stuff,

2352
01:50:33,610 --> 01:50:38,290
but I don't have Netflix as a guess.
I love Netflix.

2353
01:50:38,920 --> 01:50:39,320
I love it.

2354
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:41,530
You can,
you can watch anything.

2355
01:50:41,531 --> 01:50:46,531
You don't need cable TV pretty close to.
You can find just about anything that 

2356
01:50:46,531 --> 01:50:47,960
you want to watch.
But you know,

2357
01:50:47,961 --> 01:50:48,640
I don't,
I,

2358
01:50:48,710 --> 01:50:49,270
I'm,
I'm,

2359
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:51,460
I'm a worker.
Like I work a lot.

2360
01:50:51,461 --> 01:50:53,310
I'm very busy.
Um,

2361
01:50:53,620 --> 01:50:56,470
I participate in society so it's like 
how can I,

2362
01:50:56,530 --> 01:51:01,530
how can I do all those things and,
and keep my pelvic shape in the low back

2363
01:51:02,500 --> 01:51:07,500
shape that I wanted and the strength 
without having to go to do those things 

2364
01:51:07,540 --> 01:51:10,840
separately from my regular life.
So I just sit on the floor.

2365
01:51:10,841 --> 01:51:13,810
I mean you've outsourced the work to 
your most of your muscular system,

2366
01:51:13,811 --> 01:51:16,330
to your couch.
You have books.

2367
01:51:16,390 --> 01:51:18,280
How did you write those books?
On my laptop.

2368
01:51:18,610 --> 01:51:23,610
Did you,
how'd you sit in many different ways 

2369
01:51:23,610 --> 01:51:23,610
like,
and not in one just,

2370
01:51:23,610 --> 01:51:24,280
you know,
cross legged laying on my stomach.

2371
01:51:24,281 --> 01:51:27,610
Sometimes they'll sit in a chair or I'll
stand at the counter.

2372
01:51:29,090 --> 01:51:30,640
My,
your buck.

2373
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:34,450
It would if,
if you work that way exclusively,

2374
01:51:34,451 --> 01:51:36,160
but,
but not if you spent 20 minutes.

2375
01:51:36,161 --> 01:51:37,900
There you go do that and call it a yoga 
pose.

2376
01:51:37,901 --> 01:51:38,140
Right?

2377
01:51:40,620 --> 01:51:41,740
Well,
someone would,

2378
01:51:41,980 --> 01:51:46,920
someone would call it some animal's name
was right?

2379
01:51:48,200 --> 01:51:53,200
Yeah.
So you just move around in different 

2380
01:51:53,200 --> 01:51:55,240
ways.
Nothing completely sedentary or static.

2381
01:51:55,510 --> 01:52:00,510
Yeah,
and it's because I don't think that 

2382
01:52:00,510 --> 01:52:00,510
we're,
you know,

2383
01:52:00,510 --> 01:52:03,271
we say we're too sedentary and it's like
I would say that you have too much 

2384
01:52:03,271 --> 01:52:04,750
repetitive geometry which are different,
which is different,

2385
01:52:04,751 --> 01:52:09,751
you know,
so it's like you got to get out of your 

2386
01:52:09,751 --> 01:52:11,071
couch and exercise.
I would say maybe you just get out of 

2387
01:52:11,071 --> 01:52:11,071
your couch.
Maybe you keep watching Netflix.

2388
01:52:11,071 --> 01:52:15,540
Just sit cross legged on the floor.
Just put your legs out in front of you 

2389
01:52:15,540 --> 01:52:16,030
because that is movement.
That is exercise.

2390
01:52:16,031 --> 01:52:18,940
It's just not in a special clothing.
In a class,

2391
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:24,000
in a gym.
I go over my friend's house and they 

2392
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:24,000
have chairs.
No,

2393
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,230
my kids freaks.
No,

2394
01:52:25,300 --> 01:52:30,300
they are.
They're a little freaky for everyone 

2395
01:52:30,300 --> 01:52:30,300
else,
but they are now.

2396
01:52:30,300 --> 01:52:32,980
They've never been sick.
I've never been sick.

2397
01:52:33,010 --> 01:52:34,140
No.
What is that?

2398
01:52:34,610 --> 01:52:36,700
Got Alien Kids.
You don't bring them anywhere.

2399
01:52:37,400 --> 01:52:42,400
Travel all over the world because you 
are a filtration system and movement is 

2400
01:52:43,991 --> 01:52:45,800
your biggest changer

2401
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:51,250
and most people don't move at all.
They're too busy trying to figure out 

2402
01:52:51,250 --> 01:52:52,040
how to not be stick.
Stick with these clogged up filters like

2403
01:52:52,041 --> 01:52:54,530
your whole lymphatic system depends on 
movement.

2404
01:52:54,531 --> 01:52:59,531
A function like the biggest physical 
movement portion of your immune system 

2405
01:52:59,990 --> 01:53:02,720
depends on movement.
It doesn't have its own pump.

2406
01:53:02,930 --> 01:53:03,800
It uses the muscular.

2407
01:53:04,870 --> 01:53:09,870
What do you mean by that?
Like your immune system relies on 

2408
01:53:09,870 --> 01:53:09,870
movement.

2409
01:53:09,870 --> 01:53:10,620
Yes,
your lymphatic system,

2410
01:53:10,621 --> 01:53:11,360
right?
So that's,

2411
01:53:11,650 --> 01:53:16,650
that's what's taking your cellular waste
and then moving it out of your body.

2412
01:53:17,400 --> 01:53:22,400
It's like it's.
It's laying right next to your arterial 

2413
01:53:22,921 --> 01:53:25,800
and venous system.
So as muscles work,

2414
01:53:25,801 --> 01:53:30,801
they pump the blood over to the working 
tissues and then it kind of washes 

2415
01:53:30,801 --> 01:53:35,271
everything away.
So your lymphatic system doesn't need a 

2416
01:53:35,271 --> 01:53:36,390
pump because why would it need a pump?
Why would you not be moving?

2417
01:53:36,391 --> 01:53:39,030
Why would a human not be moving?
Why would an Orca not be swimming in the

2418
01:53:39,031 --> 01:53:44,031
ocean?
It's because you have these parts of 

2419
01:53:44,031 --> 01:53:47,751
your body that are movement dependent 
because movement is something that 

2420
01:53:47,751 --> 01:53:50,670
humans should be doing all of the time.
It's only in recent times that,

2421
01:53:51,630 --> 01:53:56,630
that we haven't needed to move.
So then these systems that are movement 

2422
01:53:56,630 --> 01:53:56,630
dependent is

2423
01:53:56,630 --> 01:53:56,630
Kinda fail.
Yeah.

2424
01:53:56,630 --> 01:54:00,030
But my kids get sick and my kids move a 
lot.

2425
01:54:00,090 --> 01:54:02,670
They do.
They do gymnastics classes,

2426
01:54:02,850 --> 01:54:05,980
exercise classes,
and they're in school and they're doing,

2427
01:54:05,981 --> 01:54:07,080
I mean,
what?

2428
01:54:07,230 --> 01:54:08,790
Are you kids going to school?
No.

2429
01:54:09,340 --> 01:54:10,270
Yeah,
I mean I might.

2430
01:54:10,360 --> 01:54:12,490
My three and a half year ago

2431
01:54:12,570 --> 01:54:14,760
it started in preschool,
but he's in a nature school,

2432
01:54:14,761 --> 01:54:16,340
right?
So it's all outside nature.

2433
01:54:16,350 --> 01:54:19,110
School side.
People are freaks.

2434
01:54:19,170 --> 01:54:21,900
We're going deep here.
What does this mean in nature?

2435
01:54:21,901 --> 01:54:22,990
School school?

2436
01:54:23,090 --> 01:54:27,080
It's um,
it's been around for like 15 years where

2437
01:54:27,800 --> 01:54:28,970
they're,
they don't have a building.

2438
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:30,590
They do all their work outside.

2439
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:32,310
They don't have a building.
No.

2440
01:54:32,490 --> 01:54:34,800
So what happens when it rains?
You go to school,

2441
01:54:35,070 --> 01:54:37,080
go to school and you know,
humans.

2442
01:54:37,090 --> 01:54:38,880
And what happens?
People live in the woods.

2443
01:54:38,970 --> 01:54:41,700
So you just use an umbrella.
No read under a tent.

2444
01:54:41,730 --> 01:54:42,360
No,
they're,

2445
01:54:42,361 --> 01:54:47,361
they're not doing that traditional kind 
of sitting and reading and working with 

2446
01:54:47,361 --> 01:54:50,990
paper.
They're learning edibles and their 

2447
01:54:50,990 --> 01:54:51,000
learning.
I mean they're hiking and they're moving

2448
01:54:51,001 --> 01:54:52,160
and they're doing their math,
you know,

2449
01:54:52,180 --> 01:54:57,180
buy,
get this many branches and how to build 

2450
01:54:57,180 --> 01:54:59,151
a fire.
And so you teach the kids to be grizzly 

2451
01:54:59,151 --> 01:54:59,151
Adams.
Kind of.

2452
01:54:59,151 --> 01:55:01,040
Yeah.
This is fascinating.

2453
01:55:01,070 --> 01:55:03,540
How many kids go to your school with 
your kids?

2454
01:55:03,780 --> 01:55:05,940
Well,
I think there's 10,

2455
01:55:06,030 --> 01:55:07,470
12,
10,

2456
01:55:07,471 --> 01:55:12,471
12 woodsy.
People that come down with like leaves 

2457
01:55:12,471 --> 01:55:13,070
in their hair and not really.
I am the woods easiest.

2458
01:55:13,100 --> 01:55:15,870
You're the woods,
the woods where they are not,

2459
01:55:16,130 --> 01:55:21,130
you're not very what?
You seem totally normal to me I'm 

2460
01:55:21,130 --> 01:55:21,130
totally almost normal.
Yes.

2461
01:55:21,130 --> 01:55:21,130
I'm totally normal.

2462
01:55:21,430 --> 01:55:24,880
I just like kids move,
like movement.

2463
01:55:25,900 --> 01:55:30,900
There's movement and then there's 
exercise and they're two different 

2464
01:55:30,900 --> 01:55:33,900
things and you know,
like gymnastics and like taking these 

2465
01:55:33,900 --> 01:55:36,640
movement classes is not the kind of 
movement that I'm talking about,

2466
01:55:36,641 --> 01:55:41,641
you know,
like recess and stuff that that's a 

2467
01:55:41,641 --> 01:55:41,641
certain amount of movement.
But you know,

2468
01:55:42,850 --> 01:55:43,940
like the,
like

2469
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:46,290
my kids move all day long.
I know.

2470
01:55:46,291 --> 01:55:46,780
Everyone's like,
yeah,

2471
01:55:46,840 --> 01:55:48,570
my kids when they're so they're active,
they're kids.

2472
01:55:48,571 --> 01:55:48,870
I'm like,
no,

2473
01:55:48,871 --> 01:55:53,871
I'm talking about like my kids will walk
two to three miles a day and they could 

2474
01:55:55,260 --> 01:55:58,080
hang and climb and suspend themselves.
You know,

2475
01:55:58,170 --> 01:56:02,130
by the time they're one,
they move more like monkeys.

2476
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:07,880
They're very confident and strong and 
capable because they've been put into 

2477
01:56:07,880 --> 01:56:09,810
challenging environments and they have 
never.

2478
01:56:09,960 --> 01:56:13,700
They don't have chairs or anything.
They said no.

2479
01:56:14,070 --> 01:56:16,080
He goes eat.
We eat at a low table.

2480
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:19,750
Sat on the floor with a low table.
Japanese style.

2481
01:56:20,260 --> 01:56:25,260
Yeah.
The bulk of the world doesn't have 

2482
01:56:25,260 --> 01:56:27,531
furniture.
I know it seems radical that I don't 

2483
01:56:27,531 --> 01:56:29,421
have furniture,
but the bulk of humans right now on the 

2484
01:56:29,421 --> 01:56:29,421
planet don't have furniture.
Like you have furniture.

2485
01:56:29,421 --> 01:56:30,360
It's a real.
Your.

2486
01:56:30,361 --> 01:56:33,840
The weirdo also ruled the world.
Well,

2487
01:56:33,841 --> 01:56:34,440
that's the thing.

2488
01:56:34,440 --> 01:56:38,910
That's true TV.
Probably couches.

2489
01:56:39,250 --> 01:56:44,250
Yeah.
So you really do have no furniture in 

2490
01:56:44,611 --> 01:56:45,640
your house?
Well,

2491
01:56:45,641 --> 01:56:47,100
I mean I have to core,
but no,

2492
01:56:47,101 --> 01:56:49,030
I don't have couches.
Sleep.

2493
01:56:49,290 --> 01:56:53,540
We sleep on pads on the floor.
On the floor.

2494
01:56:53,550 --> 01:56:54,720
No pillows,
pillows,

2495
01:56:54,721 --> 01:56:56,370
north your pillows.
A cast.

2496
01:56:56,371 --> 01:57:01,371
Do you think your heads should be laid 
out in front of you like that whole 

2497
01:57:01,371 --> 01:57:02,000
entire time?
Right?

2498
01:57:02,010 --> 01:57:07,010
You have a pillow underneath your head 
between your shoulders and you sleep on 

2499
01:57:07,010 --> 01:57:07,010
your back.
I sleep.

2500
01:57:07,010 --> 01:57:09,630
I move constantly because it's never 
really comfortable.

2501
01:57:09,631 --> 01:57:12,840
So in that way,
in that way,

2502
01:57:12,870 --> 01:57:13,410
Mike,
my,

2503
01:57:13,411 --> 01:57:15,540
I move at night like just like any other
animal.

2504
01:57:16,980 --> 01:57:21,980
You're going going,
going back to the roots I think for 

2505
01:57:22,681 --> 01:57:24,960
disease and health yet is.
I think it's required.

2506
01:57:25,230 --> 01:57:27,810
Do you ever go on the road and staying 
at a bed and go,

2507
01:57:27,811 --> 01:57:29,220
fuck,
this is awesome.

2508
01:57:29,340 --> 01:57:34,340
I do.
And the couches Galore when I'm on 

2509
01:57:34,340 --> 01:57:36,891
vacation,
my husband had to like turn on the 

2510
01:57:36,891 --> 01:57:36,891
television,
love it,

2511
01:57:36,891 --> 01:57:38,460
but it's like dessert,
dessert,

2512
01:57:38,990 --> 01:57:41,340
but we don't have this at home.
We're just going to have this one.

2513
01:57:41,341 --> 01:57:42,230
We're on the road.
Right.

2514
01:57:42,930 --> 01:57:44,880
You know,
like any other sensible thing,

2515
01:57:44,881 --> 01:57:47,520
intake of sensible thing.
Is there a way around it?

2516
01:57:47,521 --> 01:57:52,521
I mean,
can you have a bed that's like semi 

2517
01:57:52,521 --> 01:57:52,521
comfortable?
Was Zero,

2518
01:57:52,521 --> 01:57:53,640
zero,
like a medium ground or middle ground?

2519
01:57:53,641 --> 01:57:53,980
Yeah.
Well,

2520
01:57:53,981 --> 01:57:56,640
I mean I think it all just depends on 
how your,

2521
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:01,650
your state,
like I'm looking for really strong cells

2522
01:58:01,651 --> 01:58:06,651
had toe,
so like it just comes from the loads 

2523
01:58:06,651 --> 01:58:08,760
that you expose them to like your,
if you think of like what is the natural

2524
01:58:08,761 --> 01:58:13,761
environment for your body,
like you go to a massage therapist like 

2525
01:58:13,761 --> 01:58:13,860
to push on you and give you pressure.

2526
01:58:13,860 --> 01:58:17,460
It's like because your input you are 
missing.

2527
01:58:17,461 --> 01:58:20,760
Well I get it every night on the ground 
so I'm not missing.

2528
01:58:21,390 --> 01:58:26,390
I'm not missing all of that movement.
And in helping those tissues become 

2529
01:58:26,390 --> 01:58:28,770
unstuck because the floor does that for 
you for free while you sleep.

2530
01:58:29,260 --> 01:58:34,260
Wait a minute.
You think that going and lying on the 

2531
01:58:34,260 --> 01:58:38,301
ground on the floor is the equivalent to
going and getting like deep tissue 

2532
01:58:38,301 --> 01:58:38,400
massage?
Um,

2533
01:58:38,540 --> 01:58:43,540
well pressure wise it's the same.
It's the same thing.

2534
01:58:43,601 --> 01:58:44,770
It's,
it's pressure.

2535
01:58:44,771 --> 01:58:46,930
That's what makes sleeping on the floor 
so uncomfortable.

2536
01:58:46,931 --> 01:58:51,931
I don't have ever gone camping and slept
on the ground and everyone's like 

2537
01:58:51,931 --> 01:58:52,630
hurting the next day.
Like you don't have the,

2538
01:58:52,780 --> 01:58:54,820
you don't have the strength really to do
that.

2539
01:58:54,821 --> 01:58:59,821
You don't have the suppleness of the 
tissues and so you stiffen and react to 

2540
01:58:59,821 --> 01:59:03,511
it.
Kind of like if someone pushes on you 

2541
01:59:03,511 --> 01:59:05,821
really hard,
like too deep at first you tense your 

2542
01:59:05,821 --> 01:59:08,221
muscles in responsible with with time,
the way how you're probably imagining 

2543
01:59:09,311 --> 01:59:12,790
sleeping on the ground feels is not how 
it feels to me anymore.

2544
01:59:12,850 --> 01:59:15,670
It's how it felt to me at the beginning,
but not how it feels to me anymore.

2545
01:59:15,880 --> 01:59:17,550
Well,
I've camped a bunch of times,

2546
01:59:17,551 --> 01:59:20,070
especially over the last couple years,
have done several times,

2547
01:59:20,550 --> 01:59:22,950
five slash six days in a stretch and 
sucks.

2548
01:59:23,100 --> 01:59:28,100
It's just not comfortable,
but it doesn't feel like deep tissue 

2549
01:59:28,100 --> 01:59:28,570
massage,
like the difference between massage,

2550
01:59:28,571 --> 01:59:33,571
especially sports massage is you're 
needing out knots and different scar 

2551
01:59:34,201 --> 01:59:37,020
tissue and blockages that have happened 
from extreme,

2552
01:59:37,050 --> 01:59:42,050
from strenuous exercise.
I just don't see how laying on the 

2553
01:59:42,050 --> 01:59:42,050
ground would do that.

2554
01:59:42,050 --> 01:59:44,040
Your jeep,
your massage is targeted and in,

2555
01:59:44,100 --> 01:59:48,380
in local to whatever area someone is 
applying it.

2556
01:59:48,381 --> 01:59:53,381
So in that way the sensations are 
different because this is just kind of 

2557
01:59:53,381 --> 01:59:56,840
whole body all at the same time,
but mechanically speaking it's the same.

2558
01:59:57,380 --> 01:59:59,120
It's the same thing,
it's pressure,

2559
01:59:59,121 --> 02:00:04,121
it's pressure being applied to tissue,
something pushing on it and moving it 

2560
02:00:04,121 --> 02:00:08,651
around and it's uncomfortable at first 
because it's such a large surface area 

2561
02:00:08,651 --> 02:00:13,601
of your body.
It's not you being comfortable 

2562
02:00:13,601 --> 02:00:13,601
everywhere else and then someone working
on,

2563
02:00:13,601 --> 02:00:16,960
you know,
three inches or seems like that's like a

2564
02:00:16,961 --> 02:00:17,570
mini.
Well,

2565
02:00:17,780 --> 02:00:21,890
because it's hard because I mean heart 
to hard is not natural either.

2566
02:00:21,920 --> 02:00:22,820
Right?
If you're going to sleep,

2567
02:00:22,850 --> 02:00:25,820
just imagine what they want.
Something soft.

2568
02:00:25,821 --> 02:00:30,821
Yeah.
You always be seeking something 

2569
02:00:30,821 --> 02:00:30,821
comfortable.
It's just that you,

2570
02:00:30,821 --> 02:00:33,910
your bed is so comfortable.
What it does is it doesn't reveal your 

2571
02:00:33,910 --> 02:00:38,891
discomfort,
so you just assume one position again 

2572
02:00:38,891 --> 02:00:39,020
the same geometry almost all night long.

2573
02:00:39,710 --> 02:00:44,710
So in that way your movement is less 
where I moved much more during that 

2574
02:00:47,181 --> 02:00:52,181
eight hours so that eight hours my cells
have a different experience than someone

2575
02:00:52,431 --> 02:00:54,340
who's sleeping in a bed and on a pillow 
and.

2576
02:00:54,420 --> 02:00:55,940
And when I'm uncomfortable,
I'm,

2577
02:00:55,980 --> 02:01:00,770
I changed position,
which is all the time it was at first.

2578
02:01:00,771 --> 02:01:05,771
Yeah.
But how long have you been doing this 

2579
02:01:05,771 --> 02:01:08,261
for?
I've been probably 18 months without a 

2580
02:01:08,841 --> 02:01:10,490
bed.
Something smaller.

2581
02:01:10,940 --> 02:01:15,940
How long did it take to get used to?
It took me like a year to get rid of my 

2582
02:01:15,940 --> 02:01:20,201
pillow.
It took them a year to get rid of my 

2583
02:01:20,201 --> 02:01:20,201
pillow.
Right.

2584
02:01:20,201 --> 02:01:20,201
Because it was tight through the neck.
Even though I did,

2585
02:01:20,201 --> 02:01:25,120
you know,
all the same neck mobilization and got 

2586
02:01:25,120 --> 02:01:27,101
massage all of the time.
The bulk of my day was doing the same 

2587
02:01:27,101 --> 02:01:29,030
thing with how often do you have to turn
your head and look up or look down.

2588
02:01:29,030 --> 02:01:33,680
There's no need for actually using the 
muscles of your neck anymore.

2589
02:01:33,740 --> 02:01:34,700
But finally I was like,
you know,

2590
02:01:34,701 --> 02:01:37,610
after doing the stretch I was like,
where?

2591
02:01:37,611 --> 02:01:40,670
Why am I doing this stretch?
Like where would this stretch happen?

2592
02:01:41,180 --> 02:01:42,320
Naturally it's like,
okay,

2593
02:01:42,321 --> 02:01:44,360
well if I was laying on my side curled 
up,

2594
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:49,400
you know,
if you look at your dog or your cat 

2595
02:01:49,400 --> 02:01:49,400
sleeping there.
Thirdly,

2596
02:01:49,400 --> 02:01:51,530
doing these weird positions and poses 
and then I found the literature on it in

2597
02:01:52,140 --> 02:01:53,000
the journal.
It's like,

2598
02:01:53,030 --> 02:01:58,030
yeah,
we think that a lot of low back pain is 

2599
02:01:58,030 --> 02:01:58,030
coming from these repetitive sleeping 
positions on,

2600
02:01:58,030 --> 02:02:00,170
on beds and here's how all these humans 
sleep.

2601
02:02:00,440 --> 02:02:05,440
Here's all,
all these other primates and other 

2602
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:07,061
animals sleep.
There seems to be some weird way about 

2603
02:02:07,061 --> 02:02:10,151
the way we sleep,
so I just cleaned up that environment 

2604
02:02:10,151 --> 02:02:12,800
for myself about a hard mattress.
You could do a hard mattress if you have

2605
02:02:12,801 --> 02:02:13,820
a soft one now.

2606
02:02:13,820 --> 02:02:17,000
A hard one would give you more pressure.
Yeah,

2607
02:02:17,001 --> 02:02:18,620
I mean it's definitely gradual,
you know,

2608
02:02:18,630 --> 02:02:23,630
it's not with a pillow.
I took my pillow size and then over a 

2609
02:02:23,630 --> 02:02:27,430
year just came down to a smaller and 
smaller pillow and eventually tee shirt 

2610
02:02:27,430 --> 02:02:31,301
until I didn't need it.
And with the bed the bed was more 

2611
02:02:31,301 --> 02:02:34,301
organic because we had little kids and 
so it seems like you're never sleeping 

2612
02:02:34,301 --> 02:02:37,571
in your own bed.
Like everyone's always moving around 

2613
02:02:37,571 --> 02:02:37,571
beds and I slept in a different 
mattress,

2614
02:02:37,571 --> 02:02:37,910
like this metric sucks.
And then I was like,

2615
02:02:37,911 --> 02:02:39,920
that's ridiculous.
Like it's mattress.

2616
02:02:40,250 --> 02:02:44,140
My body should have enough give where,
you know,

2617
02:02:44,141 --> 02:02:49,141
a slightly different baby pressure isn't
stressing my body out and then that's 

2618
02:02:49,141 --> 02:02:51,140
when I just started to explore this kind
of stuff.

2619
02:02:53,020 --> 02:02:58,020
A lot of people that are doing this are 
sleeping on the ground and having no 

2620
02:02:58,020 --> 02:02:59,070
couches.
I think furniture free takes awhile.

2621
02:02:59,150 --> 02:03:00,330
You don't have to give up your couch 
views.

2622
02:03:00,331 --> 02:03:02,330
Said how about just sitting on the floor
instead of it,

2623
02:03:02,331 --> 02:03:07,331
you know,
it's just with the sitting is the new 

2624
02:03:07,331 --> 02:03:10,031
smoking stuff.
That's the thing that that research 

2625
02:03:10,031 --> 02:03:12,371
really showed is that you can be this 
like really great exerciser or it was a 

2626
02:03:12,371 --> 02:03:16,331
new category of sedentary active that,
that all of the active than fittest 

2627
02:03:16,331 --> 02:03:18,500
people within our culture are still 
sedentary.

2628
02:03:18,590 --> 02:03:20,780
They're like moving like four percent of
the day.

2629
02:03:21,140 --> 02:03:23,210
And since your body again is movement 
dependent,

2630
02:03:23,220 --> 02:03:28,160
their systems in the fittest,
people are like four percent better than

2631
02:03:28,400 --> 02:03:33,400
the people who don't move at all.
So there's like all this space to get 

2632
02:03:33,400 --> 02:03:35,240
better physically.
And again,

2633
02:03:35,241 --> 02:03:40,241
when I say better,
I'm really talking about basic 

2634
02:03:40,241 --> 02:03:40,850
biological things like procreating,
digesting food.

2635
02:03:40,851 --> 02:03:43,390
Some people can't even go to the 
bathroom like their guts and their,

2636
02:03:43,490 --> 02:03:48,230
their bathroom doesn't work and these 
are again basic human functions.

2637
02:03:48,230 --> 02:03:53,230
They can't sleep well and like they're 
not being like their humanness is 

2638
02:03:53,901 --> 02:03:56,420
impaired in the same way that you would 
see.

2639
02:03:56,421 --> 02:03:57,710
Again,
like in zoo animals,

2640
02:03:57,711 --> 02:04:00,740
like just pacing and they're not,
they're not on their bio.

2641
02:04:00,741 --> 02:04:02,270
Rhythms all messed up,
so I thought,

2642
02:04:02,271 --> 02:04:04,610
well I can get myself back on track.
I don't need a couch.

2643
02:04:05,300 --> 02:04:08,080
It turned out to be better in all these 
other things that we're talking about,

2644
02:04:08,600 --> 02:04:11,290
consumerism for our family and space 
and,

2645
02:04:11,291 --> 02:04:16,291
and,
and I'm having little kids you know and 

2646
02:04:16,291 --> 02:04:16,550
run around and less to clean and just 
less.

2647
02:04:16,580 --> 02:04:21,580
It's just less minimal minimalism,
which ends up being maximalism at for 

2648
02:04:22,260 --> 02:04:24,830
your biology.
Wow.

2649
02:04:25,160 --> 02:04:27,680
I'm still tripping out on the fact that 
your kids don't get sick.

2650
02:04:27,860 --> 02:04:29,270
I'm trying to figure out how that's 
possible.

2651
02:04:29,271 --> 02:04:34,271
That little immune systems are subject 
to so many different little bugs and 

2652
02:04:34,271 --> 02:04:34,520
stuff when they're hanging out with 
other little kids.

2653
02:04:34,521 --> 02:04:39,521
I know,
but they just have the strength to push 

2654
02:04:39,521 --> 02:04:39,521
it right through.
Like it

2655
02:04:39,521 --> 02:04:39,521
just.
I think that.

2656
02:04:39,521 --> 02:04:41,160
I think that with a lot of illness it's 
the delay,

2657
02:04:41,161 --> 02:04:46,161
right?
It's like you're making the music as it 

2658
02:04:46,161 --> 02:04:48,321
sits around for so long,
it just takes like what we envisioned 

2659
02:04:48,321 --> 02:04:50,190
being sick is,
is the coping mechanism.

2660
02:04:50,191 --> 02:04:55,191
It's like a sluggish immune system,
so it's not that my kids don't interact 

2661
02:04:55,191 --> 02:04:55,680
with it,
but it just happens faster.

2662
02:04:55,681 --> 02:04:56,550
I don't know.
I mean we,

2663
02:04:56,730 --> 02:05:00,540
again,
we travel all over United States,

2664
02:05:00,541 --> 02:05:03,750
Canada and Europe for six weeks.
They dust.

2665
02:05:04,110 --> 02:05:06,390
They're very robust.
Kids vaccinated?

2666
02:05:06,600 --> 02:05:07,740
No,
not yet.

2667
02:05:11,460 --> 02:05:14,580
Not yet.
I'm not an anti vaccine nation.

2668
02:05:14,581 --> 02:05:15,330
I just,
again,

2669
02:05:15,331 --> 02:05:20,331
I'm a have a particular timeline in a 
development that I want them to explore 

2670
02:05:22,700 --> 02:05:25,740
first and I don't want encroached with 
any of that stuff.

2671
02:05:25,741 --> 02:05:30,741
And so I maximize lots of other things.
Well,

2672
02:05:33,480 --> 02:05:38,480
so like with,
with I'm also an extended breast feeder 

2673
02:05:38,730 --> 02:05:42,000
so like my children had been breastfed 
for like the oldest one.

2674
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:43,950
He stopped when he was three and a half 
years.

2675
02:05:44,340 --> 02:05:48,030
So a lot of people don't have that going
on.

2676
02:05:48,210 --> 02:05:48,970
And then,
you know,

2677
02:05:48,990 --> 02:05:51,240
with my younger one,
she's just too.

2678
02:05:51,241 --> 02:05:56,241
And so she's still breastfeeding.
So there's lots of other things that I 

2679
02:05:56,241 --> 02:05:56,241
do.
I'm not really a,

2680
02:05:56,241 --> 02:05:59,370
don't do her.
I'm more like here's all the things that

2681
02:05:59,580 --> 02:06:04,580
um,
that ended up improving their immune 

2682
02:06:04,580 --> 02:06:04,580
system.
You know,

2683
02:06:04,580 --> 02:06:08,991
they play in dirt,
they've never been exposed to 

2684
02:06:08,991 --> 02:06:11,040
antibiotics or anti bacterial products,
you know,

2685
02:06:11,041 --> 02:06:13,680
things that now are showing up to 
accumulate in the system.

2686
02:06:13,681 --> 02:06:16,350
And so I think that,
I think that has a lot to do with it.

2687
02:06:16,900 --> 02:06:21,900
Do you have any issue or any worry or 
concern about your kids catching measles

2688
02:06:21,941 --> 02:06:26,941
or mumps or one of these dangerous 
diseases that have had a resurgence 

2689
02:06:26,941 --> 02:06:28,780
because of a lack of vaccinations?
I mean that's,

2690
02:06:29,160 --> 02:06:34,160
that's a big issue in the east coast is 
the measles and mumps and things along 

2691
02:06:34,160 --> 02:06:37,360
those lines that used to be kind of 
knocked down now because a lot of people

2692
02:06:37,390 --> 02:06:41,290
don't want to vaccinate their kids.
You're seeing this make a resurgence.

2693
02:06:41,380 --> 02:06:43,310
Yeah.
Well I mean I wear,

2694
02:06:43,500 --> 02:06:44,440
like I said,
we're not,

2695
02:06:44,710 --> 02:06:49,710
I'm not an anti vaccs like the reason 
like you're really vaccinating is for 

2696
02:06:49,710 --> 02:06:53,011
the benefit of weaker people for the 
most part because measles as a whole is 

2697
02:06:54,761 --> 02:06:59,761
not something that is that dangerous.
I mean there are very few incidences 

2698
02:07:00,341 --> 02:07:04,990
even when it was really bad that it 
would cause death or whatnot.

2699
02:07:04,991 --> 02:07:08,860
So there'll be vaccinated at a certain 
point for,

2700
02:07:08,890 --> 02:07:13,890
for the benefit of the community.
I just am not loading really their 

2701
02:07:14,320 --> 02:07:19,320
systems with anything.
I'm not particularly worried about 

2702
02:07:19,320 --> 02:07:23,131
exposure.
They know they don't go to places where 

2703
02:07:23,131 --> 02:07:23,680
measles,
I mean,

2704
02:07:23,800 --> 02:07:26,960
excuse me,
where measles occurs.

2705
02:07:26,961 --> 02:07:30,400
Like they're not in doctor's offices.
So they travel all over the world.

2706
02:07:30,401 --> 02:07:32,290
Well they travel all over the world.
That's the other thing.

2707
02:07:32,291 --> 02:07:35,980
But I mean as,
as far as as I spend time

2708
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:40,980
detecting where like there was a,
there was someone who was exposed to 

2709
02:07:40,980 --> 02:07:43,570
measles in Washington who came from 
Disneyland.

2710
02:07:43,670 --> 02:07:48,670
So they.
So I got a notification saying this 

2711
02:07:48,670 --> 02:07:51,361
person went from Disneyland to the 
Seatac airport who then went to this 

2712
02:07:51,361 --> 02:07:56,161
place,
if you've been at any of these three 

2713
02:07:56,161 --> 02:07:56,161
places,
which is what our,

2714
02:07:56,161 --> 02:07:59,400
you know,
the government put out in local 

2715
02:07:59,400 --> 02:07:59,400
government.
That was recently,

2716
02:07:59,400 --> 02:08:00,270
like in the last week and a half.
No,

2717
02:08:00,271 --> 02:08:01,120
this is,
I just got the,

2718
02:08:01,210 --> 02:08:02,830
I got it like in the last week and a 
half.

2719
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,880
So there are,
there are those cases.

2720
02:08:06,881 --> 02:08:07,180
Yeah.

2721
02:08:08,500 --> 02:08:10,430
So you're not concerned with that.
And it's,

2722
02:08:10,431 --> 02:08:11,920
uh,
it's interesting that we have these,

2723
02:08:11,921 --> 02:08:16,921
um,
these ideas about what diseases we need 

2724
02:08:16,921 --> 02:08:17,950
to be gravely concerned about.
Like measles is one,

2725
02:08:18,310 --> 02:08:20,680
chicken pox is another belly.
Uh,

2726
02:08:20,710 --> 02:08:22,900
all the different ones that people are 
terrified of,

2727
02:08:23,260 --> 02:08:25,150
the one that kills everybody,
the flu,

2728
02:08:25,460 --> 02:08:27,250
the flu fucking kills the shit out of 
people.

2729
02:08:27,251 --> 02:08:28,530
There's so many people that die every 
year,

2730
02:08:28,570 --> 02:08:31,210
the flu,
but most people don't get a flu shot.

2731
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:32,580
Yeah.
Shot.

2732
02:08:32,990 --> 02:08:34,170
Yeah.
Well,

2733
02:08:34,171 --> 02:08:34,980
I just,
again,

2734
02:08:35,910 --> 02:08:40,290
from a biological standpoint,
I think we're looking at problems from,

2735
02:08:40,470 --> 02:08:43,050
we're all sick in this zoo.
Like we don't see that.

2736
02:08:43,051 --> 02:08:44,580
Like you're,
you're,

2737
02:08:45,150 --> 02:08:50,150
the way that you are interacting with 
the disease has a lot to do with the 

2738
02:08:50,150 --> 02:08:51,090
state of the being that you're bringing 
to the disease.

2739
02:08:51,091 --> 02:08:54,870
So I'm working to maximize the state of 
the being.

2740
02:08:55,050 --> 02:08:57,660
What about nutrition?
Like what kind of nutrition?

2741
02:08:58,400 --> 02:08:59,250
Well,
that's the same thing.

2742
02:08:59,251 --> 02:09:00,200
So my kids,
like I,

2743
02:09:00,250 --> 02:09:05,250
I'm,
I'm much more scared by what other 

2744
02:09:05,250 --> 02:09:07,401
people feed their family.
I think then I am about diseases that 

2745
02:09:07,591 --> 02:09:12,591
they'll pick up.
So we don't really eat any processed 

2746
02:09:12,870 --> 02:09:17,870
food on a regular basis.
Mostly I think for the first couple of 

2747
02:09:17,870 --> 02:09:22,481
years of their life they had exclusively
proteins and vegetables exclusively.

2748
02:09:24,180 --> 02:09:27,000
Yeah.
Like they never had a goldfish cracker,

2749
02:09:27,270 --> 02:09:30,180
let me know.
They are swallowing a live fish.

2750
02:09:30,270 --> 02:09:31,590
I've been talking about the goldfish 
cracker.

2751
02:09:31,591 --> 02:09:34,590
They never had a cheerios or goldfish 
crackers or any of that kind of stuff.

2752
02:09:34,591 --> 02:09:35,400
But um,
yeah,

2753
02:09:35,401 --> 02:09:36,780
like we,
I make cookies,

2754
02:09:36,781 --> 02:09:38,390
I make desserts.
They have sweets and,

2755
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:42,060
and I'm more lenient now,
but like in that first hunk of time,

2756
02:09:42,061 --> 02:09:42,720
you know,
when they're,

2757
02:09:42,780 --> 02:09:45,330
when they're developing so much,
but you know,

2758
02:09:45,331 --> 02:09:50,331
like they had popsicles,
like they're regular kids you wouldn't 

2759
02:09:50,331 --> 02:09:51,000
even know because I want them to fit.

2760
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,880
I want us all to fit in society.
As weird as my life sounds.

2761
02:09:53,881 --> 02:09:58,881
You wouldn't even really know it.
We throw great parties at our house and 

2762
02:09:58,881 --> 02:10:01,170
every house has just decorated kind of 
like Moroccan style.

2763
02:10:01,290 --> 02:10:04,440
It just looks like wow.
They have a lot of cool floor pillows or

2764
02:10:04,441 --> 02:10:05,070
whatever.
The whole.

2765
02:10:05,071 --> 02:10:06,600
It's not just like you walk into a house
going,

2766
02:10:06,601 --> 02:10:08,100
where's all the furniture?
This is weird.

2767
02:10:08,460 --> 02:10:10,540
It's not like that.
It's just,

2768
02:10:10,910 --> 02:10:13,800
it's just slightly,
it's just this kind of our,

2769
02:10:13,860 --> 02:10:18,860
our odd are oddness and we are the only 
friends in our group that are like this,

2770
02:10:20,310 --> 02:10:25,310
you know,
so to them we're kind of frigates like 

2771
02:10:25,310 --> 02:10:25,310
no one likes the desserts that I make 
for kids,

2772
02:10:25,310 --> 02:10:28,020
birthday parties or whatever,
but that all being said,

2773
02:10:28,680 --> 02:10:30,420
you know,
everyone's kids are like,

2774
02:10:30,421 --> 02:10:30,810
they're like,
oh,

2775
02:10:30,811 --> 02:10:32,690
there are kids are melting down because 
of Xyz.

2776
02:10:32,760 --> 02:10:34,400
And I was like,
yeah,

2777
02:10:34,850 --> 02:10:36,040
but our kids,
we don't have that.

2778
02:10:36,041 --> 02:10:37,670
I mean they have kid meltdowns or 
whatever,

2779
02:10:37,671 --> 02:10:40,220
but they just,
they just sleep regularly.

2780
02:10:40,221 --> 02:10:41,090
They're,
they're healthy,

2781
02:10:41,091 --> 02:10:41,810
they're pretty healthy.

2782
02:10:42,300 --> 02:10:47,300
Well,
it sounds the sound ridiculously 

2783
02:10:47,300 --> 02:10:47,300
healthy.
They're healthy.

2784
02:10:47,300 --> 02:10:48,240
They've never been sick.
That's,

2785
02:10:48,300 --> 02:10:53,300
that's.
I've never heard of anything like that 

2786
02:10:53,300 --> 02:10:53,300
before.
That's really shocking to me.

2787
02:10:53,300 --> 02:10:57,410
I mean,
I thought that that was just like a 

2788
02:10:57,410 --> 02:10:57,410
natural part of being a child to gets 
sick.

2789
02:10:57,410 --> 02:10:57,730
Your immune system rebounds and 
strengthens.

2790
02:10:57,731 --> 02:11:00,550
It is actually good to expose your sick 
kids.

2791
02:11:01,180 --> 02:11:01,850
I mean,
and we don't,

2792
02:11:01,970 --> 02:11:06,970
we don't keep them away from.
We don't keep them away from sick 

2793
02:11:06,970 --> 02:11:06,970
people.
They just,

2794
02:11:06,970 --> 02:11:07,910
if they get sick,
it's just,

2795
02:11:07,911 --> 02:11:11,060
it doesn't look like what getting sick 
would look like.

2796
02:11:11,061 --> 02:11:16,061
I mean,
they're still interacting with any 

2797
02:11:16,061 --> 02:11:16,061
pathogens and they're responding to it.

2798
02:11:16,061 --> 02:11:16,530
Oh,
I see what you're saying.

2799
02:11:16,531 --> 02:11:17,660
So if they get sick,
it's,

2800
02:11:17,661 --> 02:11:22,661
it's a minor thing,
but you wouldn't even the processes and 

2801
02:11:22,661 --> 02:11:22,661
you don't even know.

2802
02:11:22,661 --> 02:11:22,661
Well,
you don't even know that there's,

2803
02:11:22,661 --> 02:11:24,570
I mean,
I wouldn't even know that they're sick

2804
02:11:25,040 --> 02:11:28,340
because it never,
they never get to an overload points.

2805
02:11:28,810 --> 02:11:30,130
What is sick?
What is sick?

2806
02:11:30,131 --> 02:11:32,260
Like sick to me is,
you know,

2807
02:11:32,261 --> 02:11:34,660
I think um,
my son had,

2808
02:11:35,290 --> 02:11:40,290
he just had his second fever and almost 
four in four years and there was no 

2809
02:11:41,001 --> 02:11:46,001
overnight.
Well he just went to bed with a fever 

2810
02:11:46,001 --> 02:11:46,910
and he woke up.
I think if so,

2811
02:11:46,911 --> 02:11:48,920
I.
So for me like sick is like they've been

2812
02:11:48,921 --> 02:11:50,780
to the doctor,
they've taken a medication.

2813
02:11:51,980 --> 02:11:52,890
Okay.
So what you're saying,

2814
02:11:53,270 --> 02:11:56,540
so you think sick is he needs medical 
attention?

2815
02:11:56,890 --> 02:11:58,470
Yeah.
Or you know how to,

2816
02:11:58,700 --> 02:12:01,430
how to stay home from school or had you 
know,

2817
02:12:01,480 --> 02:12:04,570
something running down out of his nose 
or whatever.

2818
02:12:04,810 --> 02:12:06,880
Like to me like the,
like the fever,

2819
02:12:06,881 --> 02:12:11,140
that fever that he had was like he's 
just hot and then it was just gone.

2820
02:12:11,800 --> 02:12:13,060
So you slept it up?
Yeah.

2821
02:12:13,061 --> 02:12:15,430
Well I don't know.
I guess I guess I compare it to myself.

2822
02:12:15,431 --> 02:12:17,690
Like I was at the pediatrician's office 
a lot as a kid.

2823
02:12:17,691 --> 02:12:22,691
I was,
I remember taking antibiotics once a 

2824
02:12:22,691 --> 02:12:23,950
quarter,
like a lot.

2825
02:12:25,780 --> 02:12:28,270
And do you find yourself sick less as 
well?

2826
02:12:28,330 --> 02:12:33,330
Yeah,
I mean all of us as a family that's so 

2827
02:12:33,330 --> 02:12:36,211
unusual.
All my friends that have young children 

2828
02:12:36,211 --> 02:12:38,820
around my kids' age work,
everyone's battling colds all the time 

2829
02:12:38,820 --> 02:12:38,820
because your kid's a little petri 
dishes.

2830
02:12:38,820 --> 02:12:39,370
Yeah.
And that's the same thing.

2831
02:12:39,371 --> 02:12:41,140
So I thought,
I just thought the same thing.

2832
02:12:41,141 --> 02:12:45,490
Like I compared to our group of families
who all have little kids,

2833
02:12:46,300 --> 02:12:49,390
I would say that they're sick a lot and 
so I,

2834
02:12:49,391 --> 02:12:50,470
you know,
it's like this person is sick,

2835
02:12:50,471 --> 02:12:51,790
this person sick,
this person sick.

2836
02:12:51,791 --> 02:12:53,620
And we always just go to the party.
It's like whatever.

2837
02:12:53,621 --> 02:12:54,630
Because I want my,
I'm not,

2838
02:12:55,330 --> 02:12:57,970
I know that they get healthier through 
interacting with it,

2839
02:12:57,971 --> 02:13:02,750
but I just had my first cold in,
I don't know,

2840
02:13:02,751 --> 02:13:06,050
like two years maybe.
And I,

2841
02:13:06,090 --> 02:13:09,370
and I've had kids for almost four.
And what is your diet like?

2842
02:13:09,371 --> 02:13:11,050
Like what do you eat?
Same thing as a kid.

2843
02:13:11,051 --> 02:13:14,770
A lot of fat,
a lot of protein engineered.

2844
02:13:15,730 --> 02:13:17,500
That's on purpose.
It's on purpose.

2845
02:13:17,501 --> 02:13:17,790
You know,
I,

2846
02:13:17,791 --> 02:13:22,791
I try not to.
It turned out to eat a lot of processed 

2847
02:13:22,791 --> 02:13:25,510
foods and then a lot of like,
we don't do a lot of bread.

2848
02:13:25,780 --> 02:13:28,300
You don't need a lot of bread,
but we're not totally green free.

2849
02:13:28,301 --> 02:13:30,520
Like I like Amaris,
you know,

2850
02:13:30,521 --> 02:13:32,790
like in,
in of like different grains,

2851
02:13:33,270 --> 02:13:36,390
Amaranth,
just to a grain or TAF,

2852
02:13:36,391 --> 02:13:38,730
which is an Ethiopian grain.
They're just,

2853
02:13:39,120 --> 02:13:41,130
they're just freak food.
What is this talk?

2854
02:13:41,520 --> 02:13:43,010
What about white bread?
Yeah.

2855
02:13:43,570 --> 02:13:44,520
What am I wonder?
Wonder.

2856
02:13:44,690 --> 02:13:46,660
No wonder.
No peanut butter and jelly sandwiches in

2857
02:13:46,661 --> 02:13:49,320
your house.
We have our version.

2858
02:13:50,010 --> 02:13:50,940
I know,
I know,

2859
02:13:50,970 --> 02:13:53,130
I know,
I know.

2860
02:13:53,250 --> 02:13:55,170
Good Lord.
It's really weird.

2861
02:13:55,470 --> 02:13:56,910
Yeah,
real weird.

2862
02:13:57,300 --> 02:14:02,300
Then we take your kids to Disneyland.
They see soda and popcorn and shit like 

2863
02:14:02,300 --> 02:14:02,300
that.
They freak out.

2864
02:14:03,170 --> 02:14:05,750
They,
they freak out about food in packages.

2865
02:14:05,751 --> 02:14:10,751
It's like,
it seems to be the packaging more than 

2866
02:14:10,751 --> 02:14:12,611
anything else.
Like what does that thing with the knob 

2867
02:14:12,611 --> 02:14:12,611
that they have,
you know,

2868
02:14:12,611 --> 02:14:13,550
like the other kids have that and we'll 
let them,

2869
02:14:13,551 --> 02:14:14,360
you know,
like if we're going,

2870
02:14:14,361 --> 02:14:15,170
I'm not going to be like,
no,

2871
02:14:15,171 --> 02:14:16,160
you can't have that.
You know,

2872
02:14:16,161 --> 02:14:17,840
if someone's handing out something to 
everybody,

2873
02:14:17,841 --> 02:14:19,010
it's like,
of course you know,

2874
02:14:19,011 --> 02:14:19,940
you're,
you're a kid.

2875
02:14:19,941 --> 02:14:21,800
This is your community,
this is your time.

2876
02:14:22,130 --> 02:14:26,350
But I don't go out of my way to make it,
to put it in there

2877
02:14:26,440 --> 02:14:28,240
for them.
I remember when I was a kid,

2878
02:14:28,241 --> 02:14:30,730
TV dinners had a very special appeal to 
me.

2879
02:14:30,820 --> 02:14:32,380
Like there's something about the TV 
dinner,

2880
02:14:32,381 --> 02:14:37,381
like all of it in that little tray,
like the little potatoes or like molded 

2881
02:14:37,381 --> 02:14:42,150
to the little tiny little spot where the
potatoes go and the Brownie was baked 

2882
02:14:42,150 --> 02:14:44,320
right in it.
I remember Barry Steak with the stuff on

2883
02:14:44,321 --> 02:14:45,940
the meanwhile,
if you had to eat that now,

2884
02:14:45,941 --> 02:14:47,230
he'd be like,
Christ,

2885
02:14:47,231 --> 02:14:48,520
what am I putting in my body?

2886
02:14:48,790 --> 02:14:50,650
Kenna was so one,
like all those foods.

2887
02:14:50,651 --> 02:14:55,651
I look at all the foods and all the 
sitcoms that I watched as a TV and it's 

2888
02:14:55,651 --> 02:14:55,651
constantly,
you know,

2889
02:14:55,651 --> 02:14:58,000
as a parent you're going,
am I going too far with this?

2890
02:14:58,001 --> 02:14:59,590
A little bit?
Do I want my kids,

2891
02:14:59,591 --> 02:15:01,360
you know,
to have,

2892
02:15:02,110 --> 02:15:05,410
you know,
I really liked my childhood.

2893
02:15:05,411 --> 02:15:10,411
My childhood was awesome.
The only thing that I was just playing 

2894
02:15:10,411 --> 02:15:13,880
with here is biological function because
I think I,

2895
02:15:13,890 --> 02:15:18,890
you know,
the difference between our kids and Oz 

2896
02:15:18,890 --> 02:15:21,730
is that we grew up in a different time.
Like there were no computers.

2897
02:15:22,120 --> 02:15:27,070
Like I didn't really sit down in front 
of a computer until I was maybe 20.

2898
02:15:27,450 --> 02:15:29,050
You know,
I had a typewriter and you know,

2899
02:15:29,051 --> 02:15:32,620
I took typing in high school,
but you were running around,

2900
02:15:32,690 --> 02:15:34,570
you know,
after school for the most part.

2901
02:15:34,571 --> 02:15:36,370
And,
and now you know,

2902
02:15:36,371 --> 02:15:38,380
my,
my one year old had my iphone.

2903
02:15:38,550 --> 02:15:40,420
I can,
she's a swiping through picking the game

2904
02:15:40,421 --> 02:15:43,030
that she wants to play and you're like,
like it's,

2905
02:15:43,840 --> 02:15:48,340
she is going to be cast did so much 
earlier by,

2906
02:15:48,400 --> 02:15:53,400
by this because zero to five is so 
important and it's going to be just so 

2907
02:15:53,400 --> 02:15:57,970
isn't it interesting that,
that it's going to be more than what we 

2908
02:15:57,970 --> 02:15:58,960
think is going to be.
It's going to affect more than her eyes.

2909
02:15:59,080 --> 02:16:02,650
It's going to affect more than,
than her hips,

2910
02:16:02,710 --> 02:16:05,290
you know,
it's going to be really how she thinks,

2911
02:16:05,360 --> 02:16:06,190
how,
how they,

2912
02:16:06,250 --> 02:16:10,600
how they both think is just going to be 
so impacted by the age of information.

2913
02:16:10,860 --> 02:16:13,560
How did you find this freaky nature 
school thing?

2914
02:16:13,860 --> 02:16:15,360
Like how did that,
is that the,

2915
02:16:15,361 --> 02:16:20,361
is that something that you knew about 
before you moved to the location you 

2916
02:16:20,361 --> 02:16:20,361
live in?

2917
02:16:20,361 --> 02:16:21,180
It just,
it just started its first year.

2918
02:16:21,181 --> 02:16:23,310
So it's a,
it's a model that they've had in Germany

2919
02:16:23,311 --> 02:16:28,311
for a long time.
They've had this kind of for what they 

2920
02:16:28,311 --> 02:16:29,410
call forest kindergarten for maybe 10 
years.

2921
02:16:29,411 --> 02:16:32,080
So it's,
it's popular in Europe.

2922
02:16:32,530 --> 02:16:34,180
Um,
it just started coming over here.

2923
02:16:34,181 --> 02:16:35,770
There's probably,
if you looked online,

2924
02:16:35,771 --> 02:16:37,720
you could find,
um,

2925
02:16:38,140 --> 02:16:41,920
maybe 100 schools already operating like
this and they're just,

2926
02:16:42,010 --> 02:16:47,010
they're just outdoor preschools,
although they're starting to go up 

2927
02:16:47,010 --> 02:16:47,010
higher,
you know,

2928
02:16:47,010 --> 02:16:51,661
where there they're doing the curriculum
does based on child led interests.

2929
02:16:52,601 --> 02:16:57,601
You know,
I like my son came home and were just 

2930
02:16:57,601 --> 02:17:01,291
like taking a hike some time and he was 
telling me the names of the trees and 

2931
02:17:01,291 --> 02:17:01,360
stuff,
like stuff that I didn't even know.

2932
02:17:01,361 --> 02:17:03,160
And,
and so it's not,

2933
02:17:03,280 --> 02:17:06,940
it's not like doing block,
you're not sitting out in the forest,

2934
02:17:06,941 --> 02:17:08,020
you know,
stacking blocks,

2935
02:17:08,021 --> 02:17:11,440
you're not coding colors or you're not 
doing any.

2936
02:17:11,440 --> 02:17:12,910
I think they call them Schema,
like,

2937
02:17:12,940 --> 02:17:16,750
like you're not doing any sort of 
structured Schema,

2938
02:17:17,260 --> 02:17:19,840
but it's,
it happens all very organically.

2939
02:17:19,841 --> 02:17:21,370
You just start to notice,
you know,

2940
02:17:21,910 --> 02:17:26,650
I think it's definitely lends it self to
a scientific kind of outcome because you

2941
02:17:26,651 --> 02:17:27,370
know,
my son's like,

2942
02:17:27,371 --> 02:17:32,371
Hey,
look at the frost patterns on this 

2943
02:17:32,371 --> 02:17:32,371
versus this.
Like,

2944
02:17:32,371 --> 02:17:32,710
here's how you can tell,
you know,

2945
02:17:32,711 --> 02:17:35,360
where it was frosty and like,
this is clearly underwater.

2946
02:17:35,380 --> 02:17:40,380
So they're,
they're just starting to recognize and 

2947
02:17:40,380 --> 02:17:42,100
observe deed data and details about 
things.

2948
02:17:42,220 --> 02:17:43,510
So I like that,
you know,

2949
02:17:43,520 --> 02:17:48,190
I'm a scientist,
so I like that I see things that way.

2950
02:17:48,191 --> 02:17:53,191
So you know,
I don't know if it'll work for both my 

2951
02:17:53,191 --> 02:17:53,191
kids,
but it definitely works for my son who's

2952
02:17:53,191 --> 02:17:53,220
more kinda like

2953
02:17:53,230 --> 02:17:57,010
me.
I'm fascinated by the fact that you as a

2954
02:17:57,011 --> 02:18:02,011
scientist now,
someone who is an expert in human 

2955
02:18:02,011 --> 02:18:05,011
movement and biomechanics and all that,
you've decided to try to engineer your 

2956
02:18:05,081 --> 02:18:07,390
children from the jump.
You know,

2957
02:18:07,391 --> 02:18:12,391
I don't know anybody that's done that.
Now it's done it to such a degree that 

2958
02:18:12,391 --> 02:18:16,141
you've done it where you've gotten rid 
of your couch and sit on the floor and 

2959
02:18:16,141 --> 02:18:18,130
you got your kids in some theory.
Woods school.

2960
02:18:18,550 --> 02:18:19,930
They were born at home,
right?

2961
02:18:19,950 --> 02:18:21,550
I mean it's born at home.
Oh,

2962
02:18:21,551 --> 02:18:23,620
Christ woman.
Now you're going crazy.

2963
02:18:24,400 --> 02:18:27,640
What would you do if it was a breach?
If you had to spin the kid around in the

2964
02:18:27,641 --> 02:18:31,330
box?
Good midwives can do a lot of stuff,

2965
02:18:31,331 --> 02:18:33,010
but it was very,
very close to a hospital.

2966
02:18:33,250 --> 02:18:34,120
I know.
Freak you out.

2967
02:18:34,210 --> 02:18:35,890
Yeah.
Didn't freak me out.

2968
02:18:36,750 --> 02:18:41,750
No.
I have watched and been at lots of 

2969
02:18:41,750 --> 02:18:43,941
births.
Pelvic pelvic floor mechanics was my 

2970
02:18:43,941 --> 02:18:45,300
whole undergraduate biomechanics work.
So when you know a lot about something,

2971
02:18:45,301 --> 02:18:46,660
there's not a lot of fear there.
Oh,

2972
02:18:46,670 --> 02:18:50,220
that makes sense.
There was a healthy dose of of emergency

2973
02:18:50,520 --> 02:18:53,370
preparedness to make sure that 
everything was going to be okay,

2974
02:18:53,371 --> 02:18:54,790
but.
But there was a,

2975
02:18:54,930 --> 02:18:57,310
there wasn't a lot of tension or stress 
in me because I was.

2976
02:18:57,310 --> 02:18:57,530
It was pretty

2977
02:18:57,530 --> 02:19:02,530
cool with it.
What about if you need stitches or any 

2978
02:19:02,530 --> 02:19:02,600
things along those lines?
They can do all that.

2979
02:19:03,340 --> 02:19:04,590
Midwife,
midwife.

2980
02:19:04,600 --> 02:19:06,470
I didn't do it myself,
but my wife can stitch you up.

2981
02:19:06,520 --> 02:19:08,210
Yeah.
Oh Christ.

2982
02:19:08,540 --> 02:19:13,540
Some amateur lady down there.
Not An amateur in you with a needle and 

2983
02:19:13,540 --> 02:19:13,820
thread.
Oh,

2984
02:19:13,821 --> 02:19:15,350
Christ.
Knitting needles.

2985
02:19:16,480 --> 02:19:20,240
Dirty fingernails and no soap.
Don't know what you soap.

2986
02:19:20,340 --> 02:19:22,540
We want to keep everything biological.
No,

2987
02:19:22,550 --> 02:19:25,250
it's not like that.
Did you use a tub?

2988
02:19:25,310 --> 02:19:27,580
Did you give birth to the kid in the 
water one?

2989
02:19:27,640 --> 02:19:28,180
Yes.
One.

2990
02:19:28,180 --> 02:19:28,360
No.

2991
02:19:28,900 --> 02:19:33,900
The water thing is a freaky one.
That's a lot of people that I've known 

2992
02:19:33,900 --> 02:19:35,500
that have tried to do the birth in 
house,

2993
02:19:35,501 --> 02:19:37,840
have done it in the tub to think it's 
very strange.

2994
02:19:38,090 --> 02:19:43,090
Well,
it makes it very comfortable and 

2995
02:19:43,090 --> 02:19:43,090
supported,
you know,

2996
02:19:43,090 --> 02:19:43,090
what your labor and let people get out 
though,

2997
02:19:43,090 --> 02:19:45,230
you know,
to actually do the birthday climb out of

2998
02:19:45,231 --> 02:19:45,860
the tub.
It just,

2999
02:19:45,861 --> 02:19:46,640
it's uh,
you know,

3000
02:19:46,641 --> 02:19:48,560
there are certain positions.
It's really hard.

3001
02:19:48,561 --> 02:19:49,030
You know,
you're,

3002
02:19:49,031 --> 02:19:50,570
you're teaching people how to kick and 
you're like,

3003
02:19:50,571 --> 02:19:51,950
you don't have the hip range of motion 
to kick.

3004
02:19:51,951 --> 02:19:56,951
Well,
what if you don't have the hip range of 

3005
02:19:56,951 --> 02:19:56,951
motion to squat these unnecessary 
positions that open all the bones up.

3006
02:19:57,290 --> 02:19:58,490
Lot of people can't get into them.

3007
02:19:58,770 --> 02:20:03,770
Well,
I've always wondered about people that 

3008
02:20:03,770 --> 02:20:03,770
need to sarian sections,
like women with rain,

3009
02:20:03,770 --> 02:20:08,160
narrow hips and you know,
they have a large husband and the baby's

3010
02:20:08,190 --> 02:20:09,900
got a giant fucking head.
Like,

3011
02:20:10,010 --> 02:20:12,120
oh,
what would you do in the wild?

3012
02:20:12,121 --> 02:20:12,990
Like you would die?

3013
02:20:13,020 --> 02:20:14,160
No,
I think it's.

3014
02:20:14,220 --> 02:20:19,220
I think that again,
there's a lot of things like the growth 

3015
02:20:19,220 --> 02:20:21,750
rate of the baby that our diet and 
movement related.

3016
02:20:22,020 --> 02:20:24,330
Again,
that growth rate of the baby,

3017
02:20:24,390 --> 02:20:25,420
yes.
Like yes,

3018
02:20:25,450 --> 02:20:27,750
like your baby is not this arbitrary 
size.

3019
02:20:27,751 --> 02:20:32,751
It just pops out like in its DNA are 
going to be eight point eight pounds or 

3020
02:20:32,751 --> 02:20:32,751
whatever.
It's not,

3021
02:20:32,751 --> 02:20:36,860
it's not like that.
There is a relationship in gestation 

3022
02:20:36,860 --> 02:20:40,670
that has to do with that for a while.
They couldn't figure out like what's 

3023
02:20:40,670 --> 02:20:40,670
the,
what's the signal for a woman?

3024
02:20:40,670 --> 02:20:42,210
You start giving birth and they're like,
oh,

3025
02:20:42,211 --> 02:20:47,211
it's got to be something to do with the 
size of the head and the and the pelvis 

3026
02:20:47,211 --> 02:20:48,990
and the autism signal and the lungs.
Like they're trying to figure it out.

3027
02:20:48,991 --> 02:20:53,630
Like we still don't know a lot of basic 
things about how this species worked.

3028
02:20:53,640 --> 02:20:58,640
We've kind of gone right down into like 
advanced technology and no one's really 

3029
02:20:58,640 --> 02:20:59,610
done a lot of work just going,
how does this,

3030
02:20:59,820 --> 02:21:02,580
how does this species work before we go 
over and look at other animals?

3031
02:21:02,581 --> 02:21:04,860
Like how does this one work again?
Um,

3032
02:21:05,580 --> 02:21:07,470
and so the big thing was like narrow 
hips,

3033
02:21:07,480 --> 02:21:10,470
like narrow hips is one of my,
is one of my pet peeves,

3034
02:21:10,500 --> 02:21:14,460
like telling women that they're too 
small to give to give birth,

3035
02:21:14,461 --> 02:21:19,461
but then they look at data of women who 
are up and move more through their 

3036
02:21:19,461 --> 02:21:20,790
pregnancy and head circumference,
you know,

3037
02:21:20,791 --> 02:21:21,410
that,
that,

3038
02:21:21,870 --> 02:21:26,870
that the shape of the baby again is 
based on movement of the vessel in which

3039
02:21:27,691 --> 02:21:31,800
it's in that,
that it's becoming more understood to be

3040
02:21:31,801 --> 02:21:36,801
very mechano regulated.
Mechano meaning like any sort of 

3041
02:21:36,801 --> 02:21:40,251
mechanical forces on the embryo in the 
embryo is sensing movement and there's 

3042
02:21:40,321 --> 02:21:43,510
pressure on the uterus and,
and,

3043
02:21:43,530 --> 02:21:44,970
and that's an environment.
It's an,

3044
02:21:44,971 --> 02:21:46,920
a mechanical environment,
affects foot position,

3045
02:21:46,921 --> 02:21:51,690
the ability for it to move and twist and
to start that developmental phase.

3046
02:21:51,691 --> 02:21:56,691
And there's a lot of things that we do 
that limits developing human movement 

3047
02:21:56,761 --> 02:21:58,350
because we are so still.

3048
02:21:58,780 --> 02:22:03,520
So the more active your child is a child
or the more active you are,

3049
02:22:03,521 --> 02:22:06,700
rather it changes the shape of your 
child in the womb,

3050
02:22:06,701 --> 02:22:08,700
the size of your child,
brother in the womb.

3051
02:22:08,730 --> 02:22:13,140
We'll allow it affects their spacing.
It affects their space and the pressures

3052
02:22:13,141 --> 02:22:16,140
that are on them that are there 
mechanical environment

3053
02:22:17,060 --> 02:22:20,090
and how does that affect a woman having 
narrow hips?

3054
02:22:20,091 --> 02:22:25,091
I mean this.
Is it possible that a baby would be 

3055
02:22:25,091 --> 02:22:25,091
small enough that it would pass through 
if she's really.

3056
02:22:25,500 --> 02:22:28,380
Whereas if she's sedentary and she has 
narrow hips,

3057
02:22:28,381 --> 02:22:30,090
the baby's just going to be too big and 
fat.

3058
02:22:30,091 --> 02:22:30,570
Is that what it is?

3059
02:22:30,600 --> 02:22:31,330
Well,
it's not.

3060
02:22:31,360 --> 02:22:33,120
I mean narrow hips like your,
your,

3061
02:22:33,180 --> 02:22:36,690
your hip,
the obstetrical conjugate this space,

3062
02:22:36,750 --> 02:22:41,750
you know,
where the baby is coming out is not a 

3063
02:22:41,750 --> 02:22:41,750
set structure.
You have hinges in.

3064
02:22:41,750 --> 02:22:44,910
There were things articulate and become 
bigger or smaller as needed,

3065
02:22:45,120 --> 02:22:50,120
but those hinges,
being able to articulate depends on how 

3066
02:22:50,120 --> 02:22:51,960
fluid you yourself made.
Like how much,

3067
02:22:51,990 --> 02:22:54,150
how much movement did you do,
you know,

3068
02:22:54,420 --> 02:22:56,700
were you squatting for a long period of 
time?

3069
02:22:56,701 --> 02:23:01,701
So like squatting is something that's 
totally natural for humans and humans 

3070
02:23:01,701 --> 02:23:05,010
would have to do it a few times a day to
bathroom,

3071
02:23:05,011 --> 02:23:06,750
but also getting up and down off of the 
floor.

3072
02:23:06,751 --> 02:23:10,590
So you imagine what the shape of the 
pelvis would be in the mall.

3073
02:23:10,660 --> 02:23:15,300
The mobility of the hips and the sacred 
and all these joints that play a role in

3074
02:23:15,301 --> 02:23:20,301
birth and then you go how but how 
natural are they not when you want to 

3075
02:23:20,581 --> 02:23:23,910
take them to something like birthing 
that everyone does.

3076
02:23:23,911 --> 02:23:26,310
So I'm a,
I'm a natural birthing advocate,

3077
02:23:26,580 --> 02:23:28,920
but at the same time I'm more an 
advocate for like if you,

3078
02:23:28,980 --> 02:23:33,130
if you want to have like a vaginal 
delivery instead of Assyrian,

3079
02:23:33,300 --> 02:23:37,350
there's work to do in the same way.
If you want to do a certain kick,

3080
02:23:37,610 --> 02:23:42,610
you know,
for your martial arts class that takes 

3081
02:23:42,610 --> 02:23:44,721
training to reestablish this shape and 
mobility so that you don't have too 

3082
02:23:44,721 --> 02:23:45,660
small of a space.

3083
02:23:45,900 --> 02:23:49,230
So what do you do to stretch out your 
quote unquote space?

3084
02:23:49,310 --> 02:23:51,260
Well you,
you just become more mobile.

3085
02:23:51,261 --> 02:23:52,600
So the hips in general,
so like,

3086
02:23:52,660 --> 02:23:56,780
like I couldn't well more,
more specifically like furniture,

3087
02:23:56,781 --> 02:24:01,781
like again,
look at your relationship with your 

3088
02:24:01,781 --> 02:24:01,781
furniture.
So you know,

3089
02:24:01,781 --> 02:24:03,740
getting pregnant women off the couch and
onto a floor and in,

3090
02:24:03,741 --> 02:24:08,741
in,
in what happens when you get on the 

3091
02:24:08,741 --> 02:24:08,741
floor,
when you get on the floor,

3092
02:24:08,741 --> 02:24:11,710
you're essentially doing something that 
looks like the exercise that you go to a

3093
02:24:11,931 --> 02:24:14,840
class to do for an hour,
right?

3094
02:24:14,841 --> 02:24:17,930
So all the things that you do,
if you go to prenatal yoga,

3095
02:24:17,931 --> 02:24:21,110
they give you hip opening exercise and 
like to sit on the floor.

3096
02:24:21,770 --> 02:24:25,130
You can go to the classes too,
but don't go back onto the couch,

3097
02:24:25,550 --> 02:24:29,110
which is putting you back into the 
position that you're adapting to it.

3098
02:24:29,120 --> 02:24:32,690
You don't adapt anymore to your class.
Then you do two sitting on the couch.

3099
02:24:32,691 --> 02:24:35,090
You adapt to what you do 100 percent of 
the time.

3100
02:24:35,750 --> 02:24:38,510
So just sit on the floor in that 
position that you're doing

3101
02:24:39,220 --> 02:24:44,220
and how has it say on the forum more 
beneficial because you're supporting 

3102
02:24:44,220 --> 02:24:45,820
your weight on a flat structure,
a flat surface.

3103
02:24:46,080 --> 02:24:51,080
Well,
you can't physically assume the same 

3104
02:24:51,080 --> 02:24:51,080
geometry and the couch that you are in 
the chair,

3105
02:24:51,080 --> 02:24:52,830
right?
So you automatically have to rotate your

3106
02:24:52,831 --> 02:24:56,430
hips and drop your knees and your 
pelvis.

3107
02:24:56,431 --> 02:24:59,100
Now you're engaging,
your core muscles are working,

3108
02:24:59,101 --> 02:25:01,020
so the baby's getting bigger,
but you're on the couch,

3109
02:25:01,021 --> 02:25:02,640
so even though the baby's getting 
bigger,

3110
02:25:02,641 --> 02:25:05,720
that weight's never put on the muscles 
that hold the baby,

3111
02:25:05,721 --> 02:25:08,850
so then you have to start tucking your 
pelvis under a,

3112
02:25:08,851 --> 02:25:13,851
wearing a baby support belt because 
you're not training your muscles 

3113
02:25:13,851 --> 02:25:15,870
relative to the natural mass 
accumulation of having a baby.

3114
02:25:15,871 --> 02:25:19,590
You have to be up and moving around with
that weight in order to adapt to it.

3115
02:25:19,591 --> 02:25:22,890
You can't put a Kettlebell in your lap,
trained to it,

3116
02:25:22,891 --> 02:25:27,891
you to move it and swinging it around.
He had to move and swing around your 

3117
02:25:27,891 --> 02:25:27,891
pregnancy weight to adapt to it.

3118
02:25:27,891 --> 02:25:32,680
And women that have natural or naturally
small hips and they can do all this.

3119
02:25:33,681 --> 02:25:38,681
You think it would aid them and they 
would have like a normal birth or would 

3120
02:25:38,681 --> 02:25:40,100
they still have like a huge issue?
I know a lot of women,

3121
02:25:40,360 --> 02:25:43,760
like especially in Western medicine,
they get to a point where they're like,

3122
02:25:43,761 --> 02:25:44,840
look,
we've got to cut you.

3123
02:25:44,900 --> 02:25:46,460
We can't,
that baby's not going to come out.

3124
02:25:47,110 --> 02:25:50,020
There's a,
there's a lot of factors that affect,

3125
02:25:50,770 --> 02:25:55,770
um,
the birthing process and I don't think 

3126
02:25:55,770 --> 02:26:00,271
that there is as much evidence for space
being a factor as it is used as a casual

3127
02:26:03,551 --> 02:26:08,551
reason to like what I mean if you're at 
the point where you've tried to labor 

3128
02:26:08,551 --> 02:26:12,750
and it's not happening,
you move to a Sicilian that's pretty 

3129
02:26:12,750 --> 02:26:12,750
normal.
Um,

3130
02:26:12,750 --> 02:26:16,890
but the situation in which that Labor 
has happened is usually in a city is in 

3131
02:26:16,910 --> 02:26:20,260
a,
is in a position where the forces aren't

3132
02:26:20,261 --> 02:26:22,180
necessarily in your favor.
Right?

3133
02:26:22,181 --> 02:26:23,860
Like if you're on your back the whole 
entire time,

3134
02:26:23,861 --> 02:26:25,630
it's like the baby's not moving down.
It's like,

3135
02:26:26,200 --> 02:26:28,570
well,
what could you do to help bring it down?

3136
02:26:28,600 --> 02:26:30,040
Like you could be more upright.
You can,

3137
02:26:30,041 --> 02:26:35,041
there's so many things you can do,
but they don't necessarily happen well 

3138
02:26:35,041 --> 02:26:38,520
in a hospital that have their own set of
rules and equipment in which they have 

3139
02:26:38,520 --> 02:26:42,481
to be monitoring you with.
So a lot of the tradeoff for constant 

3140
02:26:42,481 --> 02:26:46,830
monitoring and emergency care is the OP.
The optimal process is sometimes 

3141
02:26:50,321 --> 02:26:52,420
compromised,
too.

3142
02:26:52,421 --> 02:26:55,750
Uncomfortable questions the placenta.
Okay.

3143
02:26:56,160 --> 02:26:59,170
What do you do with that?
Well with my son,

3144
02:26:59,171 --> 02:27:02,890
it went in the ocean with my daughter.
It went into the woods when I was done.

3145
02:27:02,891 --> 02:27:06,850
It usually just goes into a bag in the 
freezer bag in the freezer,

3146
02:27:07,630 --> 02:27:09,280
freeze it until it's.
It's hard.

3147
02:27:11,490 --> 02:27:16,490
I mean,
I mean it becomes hard after you put it 

3148
02:27:16,490 --> 02:27:16,490
in the freezer that why do you put in 
the oil?

3149
02:27:16,490 --> 02:27:19,930
It's bloody and goopy.
Just.

3150
02:27:20,290 --> 02:27:22,540
You can't really throw it in the trash.
I mean it has to,

3151
02:27:22,590 --> 02:27:27,590
has to be.
Has to have some place where it can 

3152
02:27:27,590 --> 02:27:27,610
safely breakdown away from people you 
couldn't.

3153
02:27:28,360 --> 02:27:30,880
I guess you could say.
Well I mean it's,

3154
02:27:31,040 --> 02:27:32,140
it's biomass,
right?

3155
02:27:32,141 --> 02:27:37,141
It's right.
But isn't that like food scraps and 

3156
02:27:37,141 --> 02:27:37,141
that's what it is.
It is just like a.

3157
02:27:37,141 --> 02:27:38,980
it's like a takeout bag.
You don't eat it though.

3158
02:27:39,340 --> 02:27:41,950
I didn't even know.
Uncomfortable question.

3159
02:27:41,951 --> 02:27:43,090
Oh,
is that what the question is now?

3160
02:27:43,630 --> 02:27:44,830
Some people do,
some people do.

3161
02:27:44,831 --> 02:27:46,990
That's a big thing because you know,
that's what an animal,

3162
02:27:46,991 --> 02:27:49,980
a guy.
I'm more of biomechanics,

3163
02:27:49,990 --> 02:27:54,990
so like movement in geometry,
like as opposed to like eating my 

3164
02:27:54,990 --> 02:27:54,990
placenta.
I didn't do that.

3165
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,940
Some people boil it down and make a tea 
or dehydrated,

3166
02:27:57,941 --> 02:28:00,400
make a powder,
scramble it.

3167
02:28:01,720 --> 02:28:03,580
Well,
I think that the thought is right.

3168
02:28:03,581 --> 02:28:05,380
So most animal mothers eat it.

3169
02:28:05,940 --> 02:28:10,940
Yeah,
but the reason is not devoid off 

3170
02:28:10,940 --> 02:28:11,130
predators because the smell.

3171
02:28:11,170 --> 02:28:12,910
Who knows?
That's what you've been told.

3172
02:28:13,360 --> 02:28:16,030
Well that's definitely what it is.
With certain animals like deer

3173
02:28:17,570 --> 02:28:20,660
biomap,
they don't eat animal protein other than

3174
02:28:20,661 --> 02:28:20,960
that,

3175
02:28:21,530 --> 02:28:21,890
but.

3176
02:28:22,190 --> 02:28:24,500
But because they've been doing it for a 
long time,

3177
02:28:24,501 --> 02:28:29,501
there can be something that's consumed 
in that movement of or that in that 

3178
02:28:29,501 --> 02:28:31,250
choice of doing so that comes along with
it.

3179
02:28:31,251 --> 02:28:36,251
There's a lot of.
In biology there's a lot of naturally 

3180
02:28:36,251 --> 02:28:39,881
occurring byproduct just because of the 
relationship of how something has been 

3181
02:28:39,881 --> 02:28:44,141
done for a long period of time.
So like I use bees pollinating as an 

3182
02:28:44,141 --> 02:28:44,360
example.
It's like bees aren't.

3183
02:28:44,960 --> 02:28:47,450
They're not actively pollinating,
they're just eating,

3184
02:28:48,110 --> 02:28:53,110
but their structure is is pollinating by
default just because it happened to be 

3185
02:28:53,571 --> 02:28:58,571
the right structure that had some static
electricity because of the way that the 

3186
02:28:58,571 --> 02:29:02,381
wings flew around and then it happened 
and p Harry instead of smooth so that 

3187
02:29:02,451 --> 02:29:07,451
the pollen could stick in there and then
it just brushes up against it and it 

3188
02:29:07,451 --> 02:29:10,301
becomes this vessel,
but that's a byproduct of Polynesian is 

3189
02:29:10,301 --> 02:29:13,310
just something that occurs because of a 
structure.

3190
02:29:13,310 --> 02:29:17,600
So if you eat something to keep a 
Predator from coming,

3191
02:29:17,870 --> 02:29:19,730
coming up,
but you've always done it.

3192
02:29:19,731 --> 02:29:23,390
Then there can be some sort of compound 
that triggers milk production.

3193
02:29:23,391 --> 02:29:25,700
Like who knows,
who knows what it's in.

3194
02:29:25,701 --> 02:29:30,701
So when you.
When you look at a population of people 

3195
02:29:30,701 --> 02:29:34,541
who are having kids and it's like wow,
there's a very large percentage of this 

3196
02:29:35,001 --> 02:29:38,240
population that's struggling just after 
having a baby.

3197
02:29:38,330 --> 02:29:42,140
Could we be missing some sort of 
naturally occurring nutrient?

3198
02:29:42,141 --> 02:29:47,141
And I think that's why people take the 
placenta is because they're just trying 

3199
02:29:47,141 --> 02:29:50,261
to hedge their bets.
Like maybe inside the placenta is 

3200
02:29:50,261 --> 02:29:51,350
something that keeps me from feeling 
whatever,

3201
02:29:51,351 --> 02:29:53,450
whatever issue like there are diagnosed 
with,

3202
02:29:53,451 --> 02:29:58,451
you know,
if it plays some sort of role in 

3203
02:29:58,451 --> 02:30:01,990
hormonal regulation afterwards,
is it part of the input that changes how

3204
02:30:02,811 --> 02:30:05,630
your physiology starts going back to 
what it was before.

3205
02:30:05,630 --> 02:30:10,630
There's so much that we don't know that 
things are very easily dismissed as we 

3206
02:30:12,171 --> 02:30:17,171
know the reason or that's no longer a 
necessary structure just because it 

3207
02:30:17,171 --> 02:30:20,741
doesn't fit into our tank and so you 
don't really want to approach biology 

3208
02:30:20,741 --> 02:30:24,800
and physiology and anatomy with that 
heavy bias that the way humans are doing

3209
02:30:24,801 --> 02:30:29,801
it right now in La is really an 
indication of what humans need to be 

3210
02:30:29,801 --> 02:30:31,150
doing.
Oh,

3211
02:30:31,220 --> 02:30:34,100
people have a natural instinct to suck 
on wounds.

3212
02:30:34,290 --> 02:30:39,290
Hundred cut your finger.
You naturally do that and then people 

3213
02:30:39,290 --> 02:30:40,670
would tell you not to do that for the 
longest time,

3214
02:30:40,671 --> 02:30:45,671
but then they found out the notes alive 
as actually very strong healing 

3215
02:30:45,671 --> 02:30:48,971
properties like we have an instinct to 
suck on wounds because it actually does 

3216
02:30:48,971 --> 02:30:48,971
help.

3217
02:30:48,971 --> 02:30:50,710
Yeah.
It's just like that.

3218
02:30:50,711 --> 02:30:55,711
It's just part of the part of the 
reflexes that we come with that have 

3219
02:30:56,470 --> 02:30:58,450
kept us alive for so long.
Uncomfortable.

3220
02:30:58,451 --> 02:31:00,700
Question number two,
do you guys have toilets?

3221
02:31:00,880 --> 02:31:05,880
We do regular old toilets platforms 
around platforms around.

3222
02:31:07,241 --> 02:31:08,920
There were regular toilets.
Yeah.

3223
02:31:08,980 --> 02:31:11,800
And the squad platform.
What do you build that?

3224
02:31:11,980 --> 02:31:12,670
Well,
you can build it,

3225
02:31:12,960 --> 02:31:17,960
buy it,
and is bought a squatty potty and you 

3226
02:31:17,960 --> 02:31:17,960
just throw it up and

3227
02:31:17,960 --> 02:31:18,320
you don't make loud noises when someone 
drops.

3228
02:31:18,810 --> 02:31:19,950
No doesn't because the height,

3229
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:21,540
you mean your butts at the same 
altitude.

3230
02:31:22,490 --> 02:31:27,490
You can.
You can actually just still sit on the 

3231
02:31:27,490 --> 02:31:30,441
toilet and just put your feet up.
So your hips and knees are just a 

3232
02:31:30,441 --> 02:31:33,831
different angle.
You don't even have to work any muscles 

3233
02:31:33,831 --> 02:31:33,831
differently.
Don't actually have a squatty potty.

3234
02:31:33,831 --> 02:31:38,571
Can do that.
Any person sit down and you put your 

3235
02:31:38,571 --> 02:31:41,481
feet up.
Just take like if you have a stack of 

3236
02:31:41,481 --> 02:31:41,700
books or if you have like a wastepaper 
basket is flip it over and put your feet

3237
02:31:41,701 --> 02:31:46,701
up on it.
Just get your hips and your knees to a 

3238
02:31:46,701 --> 02:31:47,270
different,
um,

3239
02:31:47,790 --> 02:31:52,100
joint angle because it turns out again 
that the tubes of,

3240
02:31:52,520 --> 02:31:56,100
of elimination line up better when you 
do the other,

3241
02:31:56,101 --> 02:32:00,000
that it's part of the system and without
that then you have to start bearing down

3242
02:32:00,001 --> 02:32:03,630
and adding forces into the system that 
aren't so good for.

3243
02:32:03,631 --> 02:32:06,180
They're good to accomplish that task,
but they're not good for maybe the whole

3244
02:32:06,181 --> 02:32:11,181
structure like that.
All that intra abdominal pressure over 

3245
02:32:11,181 --> 02:32:14,451
time,
if that's how you're forcing it to get 

3246
02:32:14,451 --> 02:32:16,341
out moves things and other ways.
Like when you have to poop in the woods,

3247
02:32:17,040 --> 02:32:22,040
it comes out real quick.
Whereas like if you're sitting down a 

3248
02:32:22,040 --> 02:32:25,580
toilet,
it's like sometimes you can read a book 

3249
02:32:25,580 --> 02:32:27,030
or go answer a few tweets.
It takes awhile because you have to work

3250
02:32:27,031 --> 02:32:31,530
against the technology of a toilet.
That's interesting.

3251
02:32:33,790 --> 02:32:35,290
How did we get into the toilets then?
What?

3252
02:32:35,291 --> 02:32:36,910
Where did that come along?
Women from toilet.

3253
02:32:36,911 --> 02:32:38,470
That was just uncomfortable.
Question number two,

3254
02:32:38,880 --> 02:32:41,590
how did we as human beings,
how did we get to this,

3255
02:32:41,650 --> 02:32:46,650
this throne that you sit down on?
How come nobody figured out that a long 

3256
02:32:46,650 --> 02:32:46,690
time ago?
Well,

3257
02:32:46,691 --> 02:32:51,691
I think that with civilization,
part of another inherent component of 

3258
02:32:52,211 --> 02:32:56,320
civilization that you have to be better 
than someone else,

3259
02:32:56,380 --> 02:32:58,840
you know,
and so a lot of the things that we do,

3260
02:32:59,290 --> 02:33:00,690
um,
our,

3261
02:33:01,330 --> 02:33:06,330
our,
our ways of delineating ourselves from 

3262
02:33:06,330 --> 02:33:10,021
sap,
what we would call savages are more 

3263
02:33:10,021 --> 02:33:12,250
primitive people like your shoes.
You didn't want your skin to be too dark

3264
02:33:12,251 --> 02:33:13,500
or Tan,
you know,

3265
02:33:13,510 --> 02:33:16,870
you wanted to show that you had more 
affluence that you weren't as barbaric.

3266
02:33:16,871 --> 02:33:19,410
You didn't have to poop on it,
you could just poop it and push it flush

3267
02:33:19,411 --> 02:33:20,440
or,
and it went away.

3268
02:33:20,441 --> 02:33:22,780
And like it just,
it just comes soft hands,

3269
02:33:23,700 --> 02:33:28,700
cultured demeanor.
You were less animal if you were less 

3270
02:33:28,871 --> 02:33:29,530
animal.
Correct.

3271
02:33:29,580 --> 02:33:31,520
You're trying to be more animal.
Uh,

3272
02:33:31,630 --> 02:33:33,760
but the word is primitive.
I am a primate.

3273
02:33:34,150 --> 02:33:34,520
Yeah.

3274
02:33:36,370 --> 02:33:41,370
What advancements the society make that 
you think has society made that you 

3275
02:33:41,370 --> 02:33:43,200
think are beneficial?
Well,

3276
02:33:43,201 --> 02:33:45,520
gosh man,
I think medicine is benefit.

3277
02:33:45,521 --> 02:33:47,410
I mean,
I think everything is beneficial.

3278
02:33:47,411 --> 02:33:51,790
It's just that what I'm more concerned 
about is what's,

3279
02:33:52,660 --> 02:33:57,660
what has been,
what is no longer needed that is still 

3280
02:33:57,660 --> 02:33:57,810
essential.
So it's,

3281
02:33:57,820 --> 02:33:58,390
it's,
it's,

3282
02:33:58,450 --> 02:34:03,450
I don't,
I don't have really an aversion against 

3283
02:34:03,450 --> 02:34:05,940
civilization and technology.
It's just that vitamin C is still 

3284
02:34:06,611 --> 02:34:11,611
necessary,
like we can't get around the fact that 

3285
02:34:11,611 --> 02:34:14,401
vitamin C is still necessary.
So I'm just trying to figure out 

3286
02:34:14,401 --> 02:34:17,610
diseases.
So when you're trying to figure out 

3287
02:34:17,610 --> 02:34:19,651
diseases you have to kind of boil down 
to could this be a rising because of 

3288
02:34:19,651 --> 02:34:23,431
some not and input some essential input 
that we're not getting.

3289
02:34:23,531 --> 02:34:28,420
And so as people get more and more 
advanced than our,

3290
02:34:28,630 --> 02:34:33,630
our health again in the terms of 
biological sense isn't getting better 

3291
02:34:34,480 --> 02:34:39,480
with us.
And so what happens to a species that 

3292
02:34:39,480 --> 02:34:42,220
advances itself right out of being a 
species,

3293
02:34:42,330 --> 02:34:43,330
you know,
like that.

3294
02:34:43,820 --> 02:34:45,520
That's more what I'm,
I'm interested in.

3295
02:34:45,521 --> 02:34:47,170
So I like it all.
I like all technology.

3296
02:34:47,171 --> 02:34:49,390
Netflix,
Netflix might be my favorite technology.

3297
02:34:51,600 --> 02:34:53,400
It just seems to me that you,
you're,

3298
02:34:53,401 --> 02:34:58,401
you're in this really weird state of,
of sort of primitive re-engineering.

3299
02:35:01,291 --> 02:35:02,080
I don't want to like,
uh,

3300
02:35:02,150 --> 02:35:04,380
our primate re-engineering.
I mean,

3301
02:35:04,381 --> 02:35:05,850
that's,
that seems like what you're doing,

3302
02:35:06,150 --> 02:35:11,150
like you're,
you're looking at all the various 

3303
02:35:11,150 --> 02:35:14,370
various components of society that you 
feel like are non beneficial.

3304
02:35:14,610 --> 02:35:19,610
You're eliminating them and you're,
you're doing it from the jump with your 

3305
02:35:19,610 --> 02:35:20,070
children.
I find that very fascinating.

3306
02:35:20,440 --> 02:35:21,040
Yeah.
Well,

3307
02:35:21,041 --> 02:35:25,090
I mean it's a bed,
like the things sound radical,

3308
02:35:25,091 --> 02:35:30,091
but again,
as far as humans on the planet right 

3309
02:35:30,091 --> 02:35:32,521
now,
they're really not so they might be 

3310
02:35:32,521 --> 02:35:34,651
more,
they might be more radical because are 

3311
02:35:34,651 --> 02:35:38,430
decidedly non American,
but I don't think I'm really going out 

3312
02:35:38,430 --> 02:35:42,151
of my way that much to be more animal.
Like it's just like I don't feel my life

3313
02:35:42,671 --> 02:35:43,900
is enhanced with a bed.

3314
02:35:45,430 --> 02:35:50,140
I don't think my life is enhanced with 
like I'm obviously letting go the things

3315
02:35:50,141 --> 02:35:52,570
that I can't live without.
There are certain things that,

3316
02:35:53,440 --> 02:35:58,440
that I know I still have a car.
I some weird thing that you said in your

3317
02:35:58,751 --> 02:36:03,610
car and you sit on a lot.
I just want to sit as little as possible

3318
02:36:03,611 --> 02:36:08,611
in it.
I try to walk as many places as I can 

3319
02:36:08,611 --> 02:36:10,500
sit in a weird way or anything I'll sit 
across.

3320
02:36:10,501 --> 02:36:15,501
I mean,
I'll sit in as many different ways in 

3321
02:36:15,501 --> 02:36:15,760
the car as long as I hit the gas and the
pedal with your left foot.

3322
02:36:15,790 --> 02:36:16,750
No,
no,

3323
02:36:16,840 --> 02:36:18,280
I don't play around with that kind of 
stuff.

3324
02:36:18,900 --> 02:36:20,260
Now that can be dangerous.
Right?

3325
02:36:20,620 --> 02:36:23,710
That'd be weird.
Like sensory input is huge.

3326
02:36:24,100 --> 02:36:29,100
You're driving,
you're using a lot of motor memory when 

3327
02:36:29,100 --> 02:36:31,441
you're driving.
I don't know if I would start playing 

3328
02:36:31,441 --> 02:36:31,441
around with that kind of stuff.

3329
02:36:31,441 --> 02:36:34,820
Yeah.
I've used my left foot to break 

3330
02:36:34,820 --> 02:36:35,050
sometimes and it's amazing how dumb my 
left foot is like my right foot is.

3331
02:36:35,230 --> 02:36:36,690
Ooh.
It's so like,

3332
02:36:36,760 --> 02:36:40,120
it's interesting that we figured out a 
way to use the foot for input,

3333
02:36:40,540 --> 02:36:42,340
you know,
and the other thing you find out is that

3334
02:36:42,341 --> 02:36:45,700
your left foot gets tired if you were to
try to drive the gas.

3335
02:36:45,701 --> 02:36:47,410
We left,
but like I hurt my right knee once and I

3336
02:36:47,411 --> 02:36:50,770
was driving with my left foot.
Your left foot gets tired.

3337
02:36:51,130 --> 02:36:53,380
It gets tired.
Just pressing down on the gas pedal.

3338
02:36:53,650 --> 02:36:58,650
It's makes you think like what?
What muscles are being programmed by my 

3339
02:36:58,650 --> 02:37:00,190
right foot that are not being programmed
by my left.

3340
02:37:00,590 --> 02:37:03,040
Like there's a lot of things that I do 
really good with my right side.

3341
02:37:03,041 --> 02:37:04,660
I don't do so good with my left side.
Yeah,

3342
02:37:04,960 --> 02:37:07,480
it's weird.
So yeah,

3343
02:37:07,481 --> 02:37:08,470
hold the bag.
That's a big one.

3344
02:37:08,830 --> 02:37:13,830
Throw kicks is another one that certain 
kicks I just don't do as well with my 

3345
02:37:13,830 --> 02:37:13,830
left side.
And the.

3346
02:37:13,830 --> 02:37:16,160
It's just.
I wonder now,

3347
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:21,160
especially after talking to you like 
what other chains of things are not 

3348
02:37:21,200 --> 02:37:24,410
working as well because of that in 
balance.

3349
02:37:25,940 --> 02:37:30,940
Yeah.
Well I think for me that brings up that 

3350
02:37:30,940 --> 02:37:33,260
notion of alignment is an alignment is 
when you're moving,

3351
02:37:33,720 --> 02:37:34,850
you know,
alignment in your,

3352
02:37:35,030 --> 02:37:40,030
in your car is like when you're,
when the relationship of all of the 

3353
02:37:40,030 --> 02:37:43,481
parts are where they should be,
and then the way that you drive 

3354
02:37:43,481 --> 02:37:46,970
optimizes the longevity of the structure
of the car as a whole.

3355
02:37:47,030 --> 02:37:48,240
Like you don't like,
you don't have anyone.

3356
02:37:48,290 --> 02:37:53,290
We'll getting its job done as a wheel is
wearing down the break on that side 

3357
02:37:53,290 --> 02:37:54,470
where it's costing you something that it
shouldn't.

3358
02:37:54,471 --> 02:37:59,471
So it's the same thing with the body,
you're trying to figure out your 

3359
02:37:59,471 --> 02:38:01,931
alignment,
which is how can I be using my arm 

3360
02:38:01,931 --> 02:38:02,450
without

3361
02:38:04,140 --> 02:38:09,140
wearing down my shoulder prematurely 
because the muscles between the two are 

3362
02:38:09,140 --> 02:38:12,741
tighter than they should be because I 
always do the same thing with my left 

3363
02:38:12,741 --> 02:38:14,430
arm.
So I think it's less about.

3364
02:38:15,030 --> 02:38:17,580
I mean muscle balancing is one way to 
look at it,

3365
02:38:17,581 --> 02:38:21,960
but also just look at what are the 
movements you do in your life.

3366
02:38:21,961 --> 02:38:26,100
Like if you had to make a list of the 
top 10 moves you do in your life outside

3367
02:38:26,101 --> 02:38:27,960
of your exercise program,
like what are they?

3368
02:38:28,360 --> 02:38:33,360
It's sitting from like getting up and 
down out of chairs is a thing that you 

3369
02:38:33,360 --> 02:38:37,251
do most often,
but we don't do very much with our body 

3370
02:38:37,251 --> 02:38:37,650
at all.
When it's not exercising almost nothing.

3371
02:38:37,950 --> 02:38:39,330
What kind of exercise do you do?

3372
02:38:43,270 --> 02:38:44,260
No,
none.

3373
02:38:45,370 --> 02:38:50,370
None really in that I have really 
eliminated structured exercise time out 

3374
02:38:52,691 --> 02:38:57,580
of my life,
but if you plotted my body on a graph,

3375
02:38:57,581 --> 02:39:02,581
what you would see is probably five 
miles of walking a day almost carrying 

3376
02:39:02,581 --> 02:39:05,830
something.
Almost always while doing that,

3377
02:39:05,860 --> 02:39:08,530
but you know,
it's in different arms all of the time.

3378
02:39:08,620 --> 02:39:11,230
I'm working,
you know,

3379
02:39:11,231 --> 02:39:13,900
working on the house.
My stillness is on the computer time,

3380
02:39:13,901 --> 02:39:16,840
but really it's just that getting up and
down off of the floor,

3381
02:39:17,050 --> 02:39:18,630
sitting on the floor in different ways,
which would,

3382
02:39:18,670 --> 02:39:20,590
which would look like stretching I would
say to most people.

3383
02:39:20,591 --> 02:39:25,591
Right.
So I'm always working on some sort of 

3384
02:39:25,591 --> 02:39:28,321
stretch,
but it's really just to get something 

3385
02:39:28,321 --> 02:39:28,321
accomplished.

3386
02:39:28,860 --> 02:39:31,200
So no lifting weights,
no squatting,

3387
02:39:31,590 --> 02:39:31,920
no.

3388
02:39:32,080 --> 02:39:35,260
Well I circled lifts,
squat because I don't have furniture,

3389
02:39:35,261 --> 02:39:40,261
so I probably do 200 squats a day,
but I don't do them repetitively.

3390
02:39:41,831 --> 02:39:46,831
They're distributed throughout the day 
and they're held sometimes for three or 

3391
02:39:47,861 --> 02:39:52,360
four minutes while I'm doing something.
So I would say that my moves,

3392
02:39:52,361 --> 02:39:57,361
if you,
if you loaded up my moves and put them 

3393
02:39:57,361 --> 02:39:59,581
in,
it wouldn't look that much different 

3394
02:39:59,581 --> 02:40:01,060
than a workout probably.
It would probably look most like,

3395
02:40:02,200 --> 02:40:05,500
like a cross,
like a crossfit kind of workout,

3396
02:40:05,501 --> 02:40:06,490
you know?
Um,

3397
02:40:06,760 --> 02:40:11,760
as far as you know,
the variation of moves and my kids are 

3398
02:40:12,041 --> 02:40:17,041
heavy.
So like you're them around and moving 

3399
02:40:17,041 --> 02:40:17,041
them around,
but it would,

3400
02:40:17,041 --> 02:40:18,750
it would just,
it just looked like regular living,

3401
02:40:19,070 --> 02:40:21,310
never exhausted and never breathing 
heavy.

3402
02:40:21,311 --> 02:40:26,311
You never had a rapid heart rate.
So your cardiovascular improvement from 

3403
02:40:26,311 --> 02:40:27,130
something like that is probably pretty 
minimal,

3404
02:40:27,131 --> 02:40:27,340
right?

3405
02:40:27,370 --> 02:40:28,010
Well,
I mean,

3406
02:40:28,060 --> 02:40:31,420
but I also go out like.
So we're actually going out and hiking.

3407
02:40:31,421 --> 02:40:34,390
So if you go out and hike a couple miles
again,

3408
02:40:34,720 --> 02:40:38,710
carrying or hurting kids like it does 
stay.

3409
02:40:40,160 --> 02:40:41,200
Yeah.
You do.

3410
02:40:41,201 --> 02:40:44,830
Like your heart rate is elevated.
I still practice recovery.

3411
02:40:44,831 --> 02:40:45,460
You know,
again,

3412
02:40:45,461 --> 02:40:49,840
one of the reasons you do cardio,
you do cardio because this idea that you

3413
02:40:49,841 --> 02:40:54,841
want to keep your heart strong enough to
do what it's supposed to be,

3414
02:40:54,851 --> 02:40:59,851
to distribute oxygen.
Your cardiovascular system distributes 

3415
02:40:59,851 --> 02:41:01,480
oxygen,
but just because it's beating faster,

3416
02:41:01,481 --> 02:41:05,320
working harder is not accomplishing 
whole body oxygen distribution.

3417
02:41:05,321 --> 02:41:07,780
In fact,
it's pulling blood away from anything,

3418
02:41:07,781 --> 02:41:11,320
not doing that thing that you're doing 
in the moment.

3419
02:41:11,321 --> 02:41:16,321
So even that idea of cardio comes from 
being still all the time.

3420
02:41:16,451 --> 02:41:21,451
What can I consume in a short period of 
time that keeps my heart muscles strong 

3421
02:41:21,451 --> 02:41:26,311
instead of going,
how can I take the resistance away from 

3422
02:41:26,311 --> 02:41:26,440
my heart and distribute my oxygen all 
the time,

3423
02:41:26,441 --> 02:41:31,441
like my cardiovascular system is working
all the time because I'm moving all the 

3424
02:41:31,441 --> 02:41:31,441
time.

3425
02:41:31,441 --> 02:41:33,330
I think what we're talking about,
two different things.

3426
02:41:33,420 --> 02:41:35,450
I'm talking about like what you're 
trying to accomplish,

3427
02:41:35,451 --> 02:41:38,240
whether or not you're trying to push 
your body to an optimum state,

3428
02:41:38,630 --> 02:41:40,940
have you look into optimize your body's 
performance.

3429
02:41:40,941 --> 02:41:43,390
You really not going to get that just by
caring kids doing,

3430
02:41:43,910 --> 02:41:46,680
you know,
sitting down on the ground like your,

3431
02:41:46,690 --> 02:41:51,020
your body,
like the difference between exercise.

3432
02:41:51,350 --> 02:41:55,220
A lot of people are thinking of exercise
as being something where,

3433
02:41:55,530 --> 02:42:00,530
uh,
I guess you're just trying to lose a 

3434
02:42:00,530 --> 02:42:00,530
little weight or stay active or sweat a 
little bit.

3435
02:42:00,530 --> 02:42:02,540
What I'm talking about is optimizing 
your physical body,

3436
02:42:02,541 --> 02:42:07,541
like strengthening your body,
strengthening your cardiovascular 

3437
02:42:07,541 --> 02:42:08,720
system,
strengthening your physical structure.

3438
02:42:09,110 --> 02:42:14,110
Like A,
I'm a big believer in especially 

3439
02:42:14,110 --> 02:42:16,360
resistance exercises.
I think that it's very important for 

3440
02:42:16,360 --> 02:42:18,761
bone density.
It's very important to resist the aging 

3441
02:42:18,761 --> 02:42:22,280
process and muscles.
Keeping muscle density,

3442
02:42:22,281 --> 02:42:25,400
keeping bone density like you're not 
doing anything like that.

3443
02:42:26,210 --> 02:42:26,750
Well,
again,

3444
02:42:26,751 --> 02:42:31,670
I think it's about how you're using the 
word optimization optimization.

3445
02:42:31,671 --> 02:42:36,671
To me,
if you're optimizing the fitness 

3446
02:42:36,671 --> 02:42:40,100
performance tests like one rep Max or or
a strength goal,

3447
02:42:40,101 --> 02:42:44,150
whether it's a static or physics perform
like a physical performance,

3448
02:42:44,151 --> 02:42:48,350
like how much weight can I move with his
body part and can I get more and more?

3449
02:42:49,430 --> 02:42:54,430
That's fine as long as your body is also
being successful at getting biological 

3450
02:42:56,360 --> 02:43:01,360
tasks done and I think that in a lot of 
cases people can have very high levels 

3451
02:43:02,901 --> 02:43:07,901
of this fitness optimization for 
performance for athletic performance,

3452
02:43:09,290 --> 02:43:12,730
but not be performing hundred percent 
biologically

3453
02:43:12,730 --> 02:43:15,020
speaking.
How so?

3454
02:43:15,940 --> 02:43:16,900
Well,
I think of like.

3455
02:43:17,900 --> 02:43:22,690
I think if like I in the book I use 
cycling as an example where you can have

3456
02:43:22,691 --> 02:43:27,691
people who have huge vo,
two Max capacity because they're 

3457
02:43:27,761 --> 02:43:32,761
training,
they're doing a ton of endurance 

3458
02:43:32,761 --> 02:43:34,441
training,
but the bone density in their hips and 

3459
02:43:34,441 --> 02:43:36,190
most competitive cyclists is lower than 
what it should be like.

3460
02:43:36,191 --> 02:43:41,191
They actually have like the hips have of
a 70 year old woman with osteoporosis 

3461
02:43:43,840 --> 02:43:46,630
because they're not carrying any weight 
because they've.

3462
02:43:46,690 --> 02:43:49,150
They've isolated the variable that 
they're training for.

3463
02:43:49,450 --> 02:43:54,450
Bone density is not necessary,
but it's a waste actually have bone 

3464
02:43:54,450 --> 02:43:57,391
density,
so there's a lot of health tradeoffs 

3465
02:43:57,391 --> 02:44:01,440
that occur when we train for performance
without keeping our eye constantly on 

3466
02:44:02,170 --> 02:44:07,170
biology.
So I would say that my bone and see the 

3467
02:44:07,170 --> 02:44:09,091
bone density of,
of hunter gatherer populations is way 

3468
02:44:09,091 --> 02:44:12,211
higher than it is in even like heavy 
lifters because bone density is a whole 

3469
02:44:14,080 --> 02:44:19,080
head to toe phenomenon and and you know 
like people who have warned sues their 

3470
02:44:19,080 --> 02:44:23,341
entire time,
like the bone density and their feet is 

3471
02:44:23,341 --> 02:44:23,341
pretty low.

3472
02:44:23,341 --> 02:44:24,430
Like the size and shape of your bones is
small already.

3473
02:44:24,760 --> 02:44:26,950
Even if you do a lot with it,
that,

3474
02:44:27,370 --> 02:44:30,430
that the size and the shape is,
is,

3475
02:44:31,360 --> 02:44:34,270
is limited by the fact that you don't 
move all the time.

3476
02:44:34,271 --> 02:44:39,271
Even though you do a ton of work to 
optimize your fitness level in that 

3477
02:44:39,271 --> 02:44:44,010
hour,
you're sedentary 96 percent of the time 

3478
02:44:44,010 --> 02:44:46,630
so that the physical cap optimization,
it's just different.

3479
02:44:46,631 --> 02:44:51,631
It's just different.
It's just a different set of variables 

3480
02:44:51,631 --> 02:44:53,911
by which to assess yourself,
but they're not mutually exclusive or 

3481
02:44:53,911 --> 02:44:58,511
not.
Someone could be doing everything that 

3482
02:44:58,511 --> 02:44:58,511
you're doing and also lift weights and 
improve their guns,

3483
02:44:59,170 --> 02:45:02,800
but I think you can be too strong.
Like I think that some of you can be too

3484
02:45:03,520 --> 02:45:05,320
tight,
so get in the birthing community.

3485
02:45:05,321 --> 02:45:07,000
There's this,
there's this thing of,

3486
02:45:07,180 --> 02:45:12,180
you know,
why are women who I'm doing a lot of 

3487
02:45:12,180 --> 02:45:14,380
exercise,
their muscles get to the point where the

3488
02:45:14,381 --> 02:45:19,381
tension,
the resting tension is higher than what 

3489
02:45:19,381 --> 02:45:23,281
it should be like saying their pelvic 
floor and then they're having to 

3490
02:45:23,281 --> 02:45:26,281
generate way more force or their tissues
will tear or give because the tension is

3491
02:45:26,891 --> 02:45:30,300
greater than what is natural because you
can.

3492
02:45:30,710 --> 02:45:32,470
Because you can get stronger and 
stronger and stronger.

3493
02:45:32,471 --> 02:45:36,460
But at what point is your attention 
higher than natural?

3494
02:45:36,461 --> 02:45:38,800
Because of the context of doing nothing 
else.

3495
02:45:38,801 --> 02:45:41,470
The rest of the time,
like I will carry our kids,

3496
02:45:41,800 --> 02:45:46,800
but then there's like huge,
like very fit guy and he came up to us 

3497
02:45:46,800 --> 02:45:46,840
like if I had to carry my kids,
there's no way.

3498
02:45:46,841 --> 02:45:51,841
My back had tolerated it for more than 
20 minutes and I've been following you 

3499
02:45:51,841 --> 02:45:51,841
guys around all day and you've had these
kids for hours.

3500
02:45:51,841 --> 02:45:52,000
He's like,
I can't.

3501
02:45:52,270 --> 02:45:54,250
I couldn't even do it.
So who's stronger?

3502
02:45:58,770 --> 02:46:01,480
No terrorists.
Kids for 20 minutes.

3503
02:46:01,481 --> 02:46:02,770
That's ridiculous.
It was back.

3504
02:46:02,771 --> 02:46:03,700
I mean he was,
he was,

3505
02:46:03,701 --> 02:46:08,701
he worked out a lot,
but he obviously had some sort of weak 

3506
02:46:08,701 --> 02:46:10,100
leak in a system like and of course you 
can mitigate

3507
02:46:10,100 --> 02:46:12,270
that right by better training practices,

3508
02:46:12,460 --> 02:46:17,460
but the thing is a bad example because I
think anyone can overload their system 

3509
02:46:17,460 --> 02:46:20,150
and an unnatural way and then that's a 
huge issue with weightlifting,

3510
02:46:20,170 --> 02:46:22,570
especially with people do isolation 
exercises.

3511
02:46:22,810 --> 02:46:27,070
I'm a big proponent of functional 
strength exercises like full body weight

3512
02:46:27,071 --> 02:46:32,071
x or full body movements and things 
along those lines and that's something 

3513
02:46:32,071 --> 02:46:35,821
that for a long time people just weren't
even aware of this,

3514
02:46:35,880 --> 02:46:40,880
this,
this sort of crossfit type Olympic body 

3515
02:46:40,880 --> 02:46:43,000
lift body weight or Olympic lifting 
style,

3516
02:46:43,001 --> 02:46:48,001
a full body exercise thing.
That's like fairly recent as far as 

3517
02:46:48,001 --> 02:46:50,230
trends.
For the longest time everybody was doing

3518
02:46:50,231 --> 02:46:52,810
like preacher curls,
which are just ridiculous,

3519
02:46:53,650 --> 02:46:54,090
you know?

3520
02:46:54,460 --> 02:46:54,950
Yeah,
there was,

3521
02:46:55,120 --> 02:46:55,960
it's,
it's,

3522
02:46:56,110 --> 02:47:00,910
it has come in the last 10 years to a 
whole different level of functional,

3523
02:47:01,210 --> 02:47:04,240
so I think I'm just calling for it to 
become even more functional,

3524
02:47:04,450 --> 02:47:07,420
like real functional,
like stuff that you would actually do in

3525
02:47:07,421 --> 02:47:07,930
life.

3526
02:47:08,350 --> 02:47:09,020
Yeah,
I mean I'm,

3527
02:47:09,021 --> 02:47:11,800
I'm fascinated by your approach,
but I just wonder how Ab,

3528
02:47:11,920 --> 02:47:14,970
how practical it would be for the 
average person.

3529
02:47:15,030 --> 02:47:18,850
You seem to have engineered your life in
order to do it this way and it's great.

3530
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:24,000
It's wonderful,
but I just wonder how many other people 

3531
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:26,431
could sort of apply that to their lives 
unless they had some sort of a mean.

3532
02:47:26,580 --> 02:47:29,350
You have to have a lot of freedom to do 
what you're doing,

3533
02:47:29,410 --> 02:47:31,360
you know,
what does your husband do?

3534
02:47:32,820 --> 02:47:37,820
Do you have a job that works with you?
We've just run our company from online,

3535
02:47:39,341 --> 02:47:39,880
you know,
it's,

3536
02:47:40,360 --> 02:47:43,320
I have a podcast and the blog and write 
books and stuff.

3537
02:47:43,330 --> 02:47:45,880
As your podcast Katie says,
Katie says,

3538
02:47:46,090 --> 02:47:49,920
so just talks about this kind of stuff.
Breaking it down though and in,

3539
02:47:50,070 --> 02:47:52,600
in much smaller bites.
So yeah,

3540
02:47:52,601 --> 02:47:57,601
we were very fortunate.
We worked hard to get to this point 

3541
02:47:57,601 --> 02:48:00,520
though,
were just managing me and and what I,

3542
02:48:00,700 --> 02:48:02,950
what I produce and speaking do lesbian.

3543
02:48:03,620 --> 02:48:08,620
So he's like sort of like a manager or a
coworker with you and sort of helps you 

3544
02:48:08,661 --> 02:48:09,890
along with what you're doing?
Yeah,

3545
02:48:10,050 --> 02:48:11,730
we're both also raising the kids.
Right.

3546
02:48:11,731 --> 02:48:13,830
So we're like,
we're sharing so there's just like,

3547
02:48:13,831 --> 02:48:16,140
you're just constantly jumping in and 
tagging in,

3548
02:48:16,141 --> 02:48:21,141
tagging out and in taking turns working 
at night and someone works at early in 

3549
02:48:21,141 --> 02:48:23,170
the morning and just getting all the 
things done that need to.

3550
02:48:23,230 --> 02:48:28,230
He used to do.
He used you guys became the grizzly 

3551
02:48:28,230 --> 02:48:28,290
Adams family.
He was an editor,

3552
02:48:28,530 --> 02:48:33,530
like a,
like a magazine article editor sees a 

3553
02:48:33,530 --> 02:48:35,940
copy editor and a lot of just kind of a 
jack of all trades just writing.

3554
02:48:35,941 --> 02:48:37,600
So it's helped me out.
Producing,

3555
02:48:37,620 --> 02:48:37,930
writing,
yes.

3556
02:48:38,440 --> 02:48:43,440
Oh,
I bet that sitting down writing all 

3557
02:48:43,440 --> 02:48:45,721
this,
he's probably really aware of what 

3558
02:48:45,721 --> 02:48:46,800
you're talking about and the issues that
people that do that kind of thing face I

3559
02:48:46,810 --> 02:48:50,530
was probably attractive to him to sort 
of pursue what you're advocating.

3560
02:48:50,570 --> 02:48:51,140
Yeah.
What,

3561
02:48:51,150 --> 02:48:55,490
and it's funny because he was actually,
he was total a barefoot guy,

3562
02:48:55,690 --> 02:48:57,050
you know,
you know,

3563
02:48:57,051 --> 02:49:00,470
just now I didn't know this about him 
when he was in college here in La.

3564
02:49:00,490 --> 02:49:02,510
He's Kinda,
he's Kinda like the big Lebowski.

3565
02:49:02,930 --> 02:49:07,930
My husband is very similar to if you 
know who the character of the big 

3566
02:49:07,930 --> 02:49:07,930
Lebowski is,
he's Kinda like,

3567
02:49:07,930 --> 02:49:11,670
it's Kinda like that guys,
like the dude is just kind of a cool 

3568
02:49:11,670 --> 02:49:11,670
kind of hang out Kinda guy.
And,

3569
02:49:11,700 --> 02:49:14,190
and he was barefoot like in a bathrobe a
lot of the time.

3570
02:49:14,191 --> 02:49:17,260
So he was already had this barefoot 
component and then he worked in New York

3571
02:49:17,260 --> 02:49:17,510
City,
you know,

3572
02:49:17,560 --> 02:49:22,560
barefoot in a bathrobe.
I think a lot of the time getting an 

3573
02:49:22,560 --> 02:49:23,100
ingredients for his white Russians.

3574
02:49:25,750 --> 02:49:30,750
Like the big Lebowski,
like the dude from big Lebowski rights 

3575
02:49:30,750 --> 02:49:30,850
is the dude.
He's like the dude.

3576
02:49:31,420 --> 02:49:32,790
He's a stoner then.
Yeah.

3577
02:49:32,980 --> 02:49:37,980
Yeah.
That's a good place for you to be the 

3578
02:49:37,980 --> 02:49:37,980
Pacific northwest.
It's a good place for stoners.

3579
02:49:37,980 --> 02:49:38,770
It's right here.
It's everywhere up there.

3580
02:49:38,771 --> 02:49:40,900
It's grown wild Washington man.
Yeah.

3581
02:49:40,901 --> 02:49:42,430
Well,
Washington is one of the few states that

3582
02:49:42,431 --> 02:49:47,431
had the courage to make it legal sounds 
Oregon now and some couple other places 

3583
02:49:47,441 --> 02:49:49,850
is going to become legal too.
Um,

3584
02:49:50,320 --> 02:49:52,630
I think what you're doing is really 
fascinating.

3585
02:49:52,631 --> 02:49:53,620
I,
like I said,

3586
02:49:53,621 --> 02:49:57,190
I just wonder how many people could 
actually apply it to their life,

3587
02:49:57,191 --> 02:49:59,300
but I think it's really cool that you're
doing it.

3588
02:49:59,330 --> 02:50:03,280
I think it's really cool that you're a 
sort of documenting it and explain it.

3589
02:50:03,520 --> 02:50:05,170
And do you talk about this kind of stuff
a lot?

3590
02:50:05,171 --> 02:50:05,980
And Katie says,

3591
02:50:06,160 --> 02:50:07,150
I do.
I do.

3592
02:50:07,151 --> 02:50:08,920
People have questions.
I think their questions are like,

3593
02:50:08,921 --> 02:50:11,290
how do I,
how do I do it?

3594
02:50:11,291 --> 02:50:16,291
You know,
some people tweet me their pictures of 

3595
02:50:16,291 --> 02:50:18,210
like here's,
here's me sitting on the floor in front 

3596
02:50:18,210 --> 02:50:18,210
of my couch.
You know,

3597
02:50:18,210 --> 02:50:22,980
the couch is still there,
but they're just sitting on the floor 

3598
02:50:22,980 --> 02:50:22,980
and fun of it.
Or we have indoor monkey bars,

3599
02:50:22,980 --> 02:50:25,330
so they're.
So that even if we're inside,

3600
02:50:25,331 --> 02:50:27,070
you know,
the kids can still train,

3601
02:50:27,071 --> 02:50:32,071
we can all train.
So they just kind of go down the 

3602
02:50:32,071 --> 02:50:32,071
kitchen.
Yeah,

3603
02:50:32,280 --> 02:50:34,890
you guys are freaks.
But.

3604
02:50:34,930 --> 02:50:36,760
So are lots of other people now.

3605
02:50:37,030 --> 02:50:37,910
Yeah.
Listen,

3606
02:50:37,940 --> 02:50:39,740
people come over my house.
I think I'm a freak too.

3607
02:50:39,741 --> 02:50:41,240
I mean,
we're all freaks in our own little weird

3608
02:50:41,241 --> 02:50:41,760
way.
Sure.

3609
02:50:41,940 --> 02:50:46,940
But I think you were.
Freakiness is a very healthy and I'm 

3610
02:50:46,940 --> 02:50:47,450
conscientious freakiness and they'd say 
it's pretty.

3611
02:50:47,451 --> 02:50:49,820
Obviously you're thinking this is not 
just something,

3612
02:50:49,821 --> 02:50:54,821
you're just jumping into this.
You put a great deal of thought into 

3613
02:50:54,821 --> 02:50:54,821
this.
Yeah.

3614
02:50:54,821 --> 02:50:55,980
Um,
what kind of criticisms do you get?

3615
02:50:55,981 --> 02:50:58,030
I mean,
I'm sure you must get criticisms because

3616
02:50:58,040 --> 02:50:59,600
the anti anti anti-vaccine.
Well,

3617
02:50:59,630 --> 02:51:01,790
none.
Not even your anti-vaccination yeah.

3618
02:51:01,850 --> 02:51:04,730
The fact that you have not yet 
vaccinated your kids.

3619
02:51:04,940 --> 02:51:05,530
Well,
I don't know.

3620
02:51:05,540 --> 02:51:09,100
It's the first time I ever told anyone 
publicly than I don't.

3621
02:51:09,560 --> 02:51:10,940
Yeah.
No one's ever asked me before.

3622
02:51:11,480 --> 02:51:13,040
I'm not anti.
I'm not an anti.

3623
02:51:13,700 --> 02:51:16,490
I'm not an anti vaccinator.
I believe in,

3624
02:51:17,180 --> 02:51:18,320
in vaccines.
I just,

3625
02:51:18,560 --> 02:51:19,140
I've just,
there's,

3626
02:51:19,220 --> 02:51:23,450
there's just a timeline like I am.
I at what I didn't do as do early,

3627
02:51:23,780 --> 02:51:24,680
you know,
vaccines.

3628
02:51:24,681 --> 02:51:28,400
I have a lot of.
I work with a lot of people in medicine,

3629
02:51:28,520 --> 02:51:33,520
a lot of people on a regular basis.
And so I just have the way that I'm 

3630
02:51:33,520 --> 02:51:34,340
doing it,
but um,

3631
02:51:35,180 --> 02:51:37,450
yeah,
I guess it is a big,

3632
02:51:37,510 --> 02:51:39,430
that's a hot topic.
It is a hot topic.

3633
02:51:39,720 --> 02:51:42,680
It's a hot topic in terms of criticism 
as well.

3634
02:51:42,780 --> 02:51:47,780
People love to jump on people that 
aren't vaccinating their kids or jump 

3635
02:51:47,780 --> 02:51:51,570
in.
Anyone who's trying to connect any 

3636
02:51:51,570 --> 02:51:51,790
vaccinations towards any sort of 
ailments and diseases.

3637
02:51:51,791 --> 02:51:52,950
And you know,
I,

3638
02:51:53,170 --> 02:51:58,170
I've talked to many doctors and that are
pro vaccine that think that the 

3639
02:51:59,171 --> 02:52:04,171
protocols that we instill as far as like
everyone being subscribed to the same,

3640
02:52:06,100 --> 02:52:09,880
like this is probably not the best way 
to deal with anything biological because

3641
02:52:09,881 --> 02:52:14,881
people have so much bio diversity.
There's so much difference between one 

3642
02:52:14,881 --> 02:52:19,831
thing that will make someone terribly 
ill and the same exact substance,

3643
02:52:20,051 --> 02:52:25,051
one effect someone at all,
whether it's allergies or sensitivities 

3644
02:52:25,051 --> 02:52:29,101
to certain medications.
And it's just you're going to run the 

3645
02:52:29,101 --> 02:52:29,101
risk,
especially when you're,

3646
02:52:29,101 --> 02:52:32,770
you're introducing a lot of chemicals 
into a very young immune system.

3647
02:52:32,771 --> 02:52:33,820
A very young child.

3648
02:52:33,990 --> 02:52:34,980
Yeah,
I mean I,

3649
02:52:35,780 --> 02:52:37,320
I,
I would agree there's a,

3650
02:52:37,321 --> 02:52:42,321
there's a timing.
There was a timing issue for us in the 

3651
02:52:42,321 --> 02:52:43,540
way that we wanted to do it.
Um,

3652
02:52:43,630 --> 02:52:46,560
I don't think.
I'm not really even a,

3653
02:52:47,070 --> 02:52:52,070
I don't really believe that the 
vaccinations are tied to any ailment or 

3654
02:52:52,070 --> 02:52:52,170
anything.
Like that's not,

3655
02:52:52,230 --> 02:52:56,220
that's not my bag at all.
It's just more like there is like,

3656
02:52:56,630 --> 02:53:01,630
I think it's a load I think of just a 
load to the body as a whole and watching

3657
02:53:02,660 --> 02:53:07,660
I'm wanting my children to process and 
develop certain things first where you 

3658
02:53:10,861 --> 02:53:11,760
know,
the risk of,

3659
02:53:12,360 --> 02:53:14,820
of any overload or mismatch as you call 
it.

3660
02:53:14,821 --> 02:53:19,821
Like in terms of biology and medicine 
where it's just less of a less of a new 

3661
02:53:19,980 --> 02:53:20,880
new thing,
you know,

3662
02:53:20,881 --> 02:53:25,881
the structure is a little bit more,
more formed and more able to process 

3663
02:53:26,550 --> 02:53:27,570
anything that you put into it.

3664
02:53:27,820 --> 02:53:30,450
It seems like there's an issue with,
um,

3665
02:53:30,490 --> 02:53:35,490
some parents where some parents want to 
criticize people that are raising their 

3666
02:53:35,490 --> 02:53:40,411
kids in a different way and they do it 
for either because they don't like the 

3667
02:53:40,411 --> 02:53:42,370
way it makes them examined,
the way they're raising their kids.

3668
02:53:42,371 --> 02:53:47,371
So they get,
they do it defensively or they're 

3669
02:53:47,371 --> 02:53:49,591
judgmental or you know that everybody 
thinks they're doing it the right way 

3670
02:53:49,591 --> 02:53:49,591
and then everybody else is doing it the 
wrong way.

3671
02:53:49,600 --> 02:53:54,600
Do you face a lot of that?
Because this is a very unconventional 

3672
02:53:54,600 --> 02:53:54,600
way of raising children?

3673
02:53:54,600 --> 02:53:55,590
It is.
And that's I think out of all the.

3674
02:53:55,610 --> 02:54:00,610
If I got any criticisms it would be for,
for that,

3675
02:54:00,870 --> 02:54:05,280
for the way that we want to raise our 
kids and I,

3676
02:54:06,090 --> 02:54:09,390
and I don't have any problem with the 
way that anyone wants to raise her kids.

3677
02:54:09,391 --> 02:54:14,391
Like this is just what we're,
this is just what we're doing and this 

3678
02:54:14,391 --> 02:54:16,751
is what we're trying.
I just happened to be in a more public 

3679
02:54:16,751 --> 02:54:16,751
format and I'm writing about it.
I mean I'm,

3680
02:54:16,751 --> 02:54:21,741
I'm making.
There's very conscious biomechanical 

3681
02:54:21,741 --> 02:54:23,220
choices of why I'm doing what I'm doing.
Like I got to go,

3682
02:54:23,221 --> 02:54:28,221
here's the process of 
mechanotransduction and here's the list 

3683
02:54:28,221 --> 02:54:30,090
of diseases and here's,
here's the known environments.

3684
02:54:30,091 --> 02:54:32,160
And so here's the environments that 
we're changing.

3685
02:54:32,161 --> 02:54:35,580
So in that way it's kind of like a,
an experiment in,

3686
02:54:36,090 --> 02:54:37,410
in current process,
right?

3687
02:54:37,411 --> 02:54:38,580
That we're,
that we're doing.

3688
02:54:38,581 --> 02:54:39,210
But yeah,
it's,

3689
02:54:39,540 --> 02:54:42,630
I think the worst thing I was ever 
called by someone,

3690
02:54:43,240 --> 02:54:45,240
you know,
in a comment section and I don't spend.

3691
02:54:45,630 --> 02:54:49,230
I spent almost zero time reading 
comments or whatever.

3692
02:54:49,231 --> 02:54:51,440
It's not my sound.
My thing is smart.

3693
02:54:51,870 --> 02:54:52,890
Yeah.
I was just like,

3694
02:54:52,891 --> 02:54:57,891
I feel like the quality of interaction 
isn't someone who is really wanting to 

3695
02:54:57,891 --> 02:54:59,710
have a thoughtful discussion with me to.

3696
02:55:00,150 --> 02:55:01,540
Unless you really.
I mean it's,

3697
02:55:01,640 --> 02:55:04,220
it's hard to manage those things too if 
you can.

3698
02:55:05,220 --> 02:55:08,150
No one wants censorship,
but you've got to eliminate assholes.

3699
02:55:08,210 --> 02:55:13,210
You know?
It's not like censorship as far as the 

3700
02:55:13,210 --> 02:55:14,030
way the ideas are expressed or the ideas
themselves.

3701
02:55:14,180 --> 02:55:19,180
It's the way they're expressed in the 
insulting manner in which people can do 

3702
02:55:19,180 --> 02:55:21,380
it anonymously.
If there was some reason to not.

3703
02:55:21,630 --> 02:55:25,070
If there's some way to not have it be 
anonymous and that you would see,

3704
02:55:26,170 --> 02:55:29,390
then all of a sudden you're interacting 
with some person and what's lacking is a

3705
02:55:29,391 --> 02:55:34,391
social cue.
So there's things that people will tell 

3706
02:55:34,391 --> 02:55:34,520
you things in online that they would 
never tell you,

3707
02:55:35,270 --> 02:55:38,270
just looking at you in front of you.
And if they did,

3708
02:55:38,271 --> 02:55:40,760
they would be completely socially 
retarded to do that.

3709
02:55:40,970 --> 02:55:42,960
But just it's,
there's no consequences.

3710
02:55:42,970 --> 02:55:47,970
Just typing something shitty.
And the one thing that you can glean 

3711
02:55:47,970 --> 02:55:50,870
that you can get from that is that all 
those people were socially retarded.

3712
02:55:51,260 --> 02:55:52,850
Anyone who does that like,
okay,

3713
02:55:52,851 --> 02:55:57,851
you're input is,
it's not valid because your input like 

3714
02:55:57,851 --> 02:55:58,550
this insulting thing that you've 
written,

3715
02:55:58,610 --> 02:56:00,110
you've written that because you're an 
idiot.

3716
02:56:00,280 --> 02:56:01,820
Like that's it.
That's the only reason why you do it.

3717
02:56:01,821 --> 02:56:06,821
If you're a sensitive person or if 
you're a person that considers that 

3718
02:56:06,821 --> 02:56:06,821
person,
the other analyst I person,

3719
02:56:06,821 --> 02:56:09,380
obviously he's doing something horribly 
racist or sexist or whatever,

3720
02:56:09,381 --> 02:56:09,860
you know,
whatever.

3721
02:56:09,861 --> 02:56:11,600
In some way that victimizes other 
people,

3722
02:56:11,750 --> 02:56:16,750
you're just talking about someone's 
opinions and ideas and doing so in a 

3723
02:56:16,750 --> 02:56:19,451
very insulting way.
You're doing so because you're an 

3724
02:56:19,451 --> 02:56:19,451
emotionally stunted fuckhead.
I'm like,

3725
02:56:19,451 --> 02:56:20,240
that's what you are.
And so that's why you're.

3726
02:56:20,500 --> 02:56:25,500
That's why you're drawn to this 
anonymous contribution in the first 

3727
02:56:25,500 --> 02:56:25,690
place.
Whereas the ver,

3728
02:56:25,910 --> 02:56:30,910
the large majority of people and they 
watch a youtube video will not leave a 

3729
02:56:30,910 --> 02:56:30,910
comment,
right?

3730
02:56:30,910 --> 02:56:35,560
The large majority and the people that 
do the overwhelming number of negative 

3731
02:56:35,751 --> 02:56:40,751
comments like it's represents way more 
than I think the average population 

3732
02:56:41,271 --> 02:56:44,720
because you're dealing with a sort of a 
stunted group in the first place.

3733
02:56:44,950 --> 02:56:48,440
I think you're already.
There's already a certain type of person

3734
02:56:48,690 --> 02:56:50,750
who will comment so you're not looking 
at.

3735
02:56:51,170 --> 02:56:53,780
You're not looking at a good cross 
section of humanity.

3736
02:56:53,781 --> 02:56:58,781
I don't think when you're looking at 
youtube comments like I have a message 

3737
02:56:58,781 --> 02:56:59,480
board and it's,
it's amazing that mean had,

3738
02:56:59,690 --> 02:57:02,810
I've had it since 1998 and that there's 
always going to be assholes.

3739
02:57:02,840 --> 02:57:07,840
There's a certain amount of assholes,
so you just going to get a certain 

3740
02:57:07,840 --> 02:57:07,840
amount.
People,

3741
02:57:07,840 --> 02:57:08,360
they just want attention so they just 
want to be shitty and insulting.

3742
02:57:08,750 --> 02:57:13,750
But the intelligent discussions that the
large majority have intelligent 

3743
02:57:13,750 --> 02:57:16,070
discussions and an interesting different
viewpoints.

3744
02:57:16,071 --> 02:57:21,071
And once people get away from this idea 
of just a demanding attention by just 

3745
02:57:22,250 --> 02:57:27,250
being just shitty,
which is what a lot of people do in 

3746
02:57:27,250 --> 02:57:29,780
these social network forums,
whether it's twitter or facebook,

3747
02:57:30,050 --> 02:57:32,030
they get more attention by being shitty.

3748
02:57:32,500 --> 02:57:33,980
Uh,
but once you get past that,

3749
02:57:34,010 --> 02:57:37,100
like you can find communities,
you can cultivate communities,

3750
02:57:37,220 --> 02:57:42,220
but it's hard to do without some form of
regulation when you regulate your 

3751
02:57:42,220 --> 02:57:43,520
sensor.
And so it becomes like,

3752
02:57:43,680 --> 02:57:44,960
you know,
what's going on in France right now,

3753
02:57:44,961 --> 02:57:45,830
of course,
right with the,

3754
02:57:45,831 --> 02:57:46,880
this,
this,

3755
02:57:47,110 --> 02:57:48,380
uh,
cartoonists,

3756
02:57:48,460 --> 02:57:50,270
uh,
these people that were killed,

3757
02:57:50,480 --> 02:57:55,480
well now Francis arrested like 60 people
for making facebook posts that they 

3758
02:57:56,061 --> 02:58:01,061
thought were either in,
in support of terrorism or criticizing 

3759
02:58:01,921 --> 02:58:06,030
their government.
They re arrested a comedian recently for

3760
02:58:06,060 --> 02:58:11,060
some,
some comment that he's made about the 

3761
02:58:11,060 --> 02:58:13,890
relationship between terrorism and this,
this,

3762
02:58:14,190 --> 02:58:16,020
this,
this horrible tragedy.

3763
02:58:16,021 --> 02:58:17,670
It's really kind of fucked up because 
it's like,

3764
02:58:17,671 --> 02:58:22,671
it's Kinda counterintuitive to the whole
idea that you're supposed to be 

3765
02:58:22,671 --> 02:58:23,450
supporting in the first place.
But the,

3766
02:58:23,820 --> 02:58:26,910
the communities that we have online 
right now,

3767
02:58:26,911 --> 02:58:30,060
I think a big part of it is they don't 
feel the interaction.

3768
02:58:30,090 --> 02:58:32,490
They just send it out there,
almost like a message in the bottle.

3769
02:58:32,491 --> 02:58:33,860
And you were on the other hand 
receiving.

3770
02:58:34,090 --> 02:58:39,090
Do you read all your,
a lot of your comments on your board 

3771
02:58:39,090 --> 02:58:41,241
still?
I read a lot of the comments on the 

3772
02:58:41,241 --> 02:58:41,241
board.
I read a lot of comments on twitter.

3773
02:58:41,241 --> 02:58:42,290
I still interact with people,
but it's like I.

3774
02:58:42,400 --> 02:58:47,400
I believe it's like snake venom like you
get if you just get bitten by a snake 

3775
02:58:47,400 --> 02:58:48,390
and never been bitten before,
you kind of fucked.

3776
02:58:48,690 --> 02:58:51,090
But if you get snake venom all the time,
you go,

3777
02:58:51,120 --> 02:58:51,930
oh,
I know what that is.

3778
02:58:52,070 --> 02:58:54,450
Some fucking Weirdo.
That's a good way to say it.

3779
02:58:54,451 --> 02:58:59,451
You could feel the.
I know I have a very kind kind of group 

3780
02:58:59,451 --> 02:59:01,040
of people who read and follow him.
Tweet at.

3781
02:59:01,060 --> 02:59:03,100
Very rarely do I get,
you know,

3782
02:59:03,120 --> 02:59:05,010
the kind of person,
but you occasionally get mean people.

3783
02:59:05,430 --> 02:59:08,670
I mean the biggest one was someone who 
said that I was racist.

3784
02:59:08,671 --> 02:59:13,671
I was raising my children is 
colonialists and because I didn't have 

3785
02:59:13,671 --> 02:59:13,671
furniture,
Linda,

3786
02:59:13,671 --> 02:59:14,630
you don't even want to sit down.
You sit in your own culture,

3787
02:59:14,790 --> 02:59:17,340
furniture and stuff like sit in your own
cultures,

3788
02:59:17,341 --> 02:59:20,840
furniture,
plantation furniture.

3789
02:59:22,270 --> 02:59:26,010
It was such a random irritation for this
person,

3790
02:59:26,011 --> 02:59:27,400
so can't read that.
No.

3791
02:59:27,920 --> 02:59:28,920

3795
02:59:36,951 --> 02:59:38,631
