1
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,120
This is my granddad's plan alone.

2
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,710
You don't want her job to, this is you're
making me very, very uncomfortable.

3
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,240
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is
brought to you by [inaudible] dot com and

4
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,860
that's o n n I t,

5
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:33,760
makers of Alpha Brain shroom tech
shroom tech sport. Had to take my alpha.

6
00:00:33,761 --> 00:00:36,870
Right. I already took it once broke.
Fuck it. It was a late night podcast.

7
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,270
My Man Duncan Trussell
hello friends. Had to, uh,

8
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,590
we had to do another podcast today.
Ladies and gentlemen,

9
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,250
I couldn't just leave well enough alone.
He wants one of these probably.

10
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:52,020
I would love some. Here we
go. Can you snort these?

11
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:58,020
I guess you probably could. Probably
wouldn't. We were right by the door.

12
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:03,120
Huh? Um, what are, what are nootropics?

13
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:03,621
It's all,

14
00:01:03,621 --> 00:01:06,830
all the information is available on
[inaudible] dot com and that's what I'm

15
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,610
Alpha brain is.
It's a nootropic.

16
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,930
So essentially it's a blend of nutrients
that's been designed to enhance the way

17
00:01:12,931 --> 00:01:17,120
your brain functions. Go to [inaudible]
dot com for all the details.

18
00:01:17,121 --> 00:01:19,380
It's o, n, n, I, T and nick.

19
00:01:19,381 --> 00:01:23,790
And explain to you what are the
findings behind each ingredient.

20
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:26,000
That is a bin,
you know,

21
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,360
designed to give you like a
nice boost. It's not like, um,

22
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,960
anything that it's going to change
you and make you a smart person,

23
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:36,420
but it's going to make your
brain function at a good level.

24
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,360
But we guarantee you will
raise your Iq by 20 points.

25
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,700
No Dunkin and you're just making that up.

26
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,300
You can't do that in the middle
of a commercial on the Internet.

27
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,920
He just fucked everything up buddy.
Finish this fucked up the whole world.

28
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:54,000
You know, you don't have to finish
the sentence. It's written somewhere.

29
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,450
I tell you, he's going to need
some of these fucking Alpha brands.

30
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,760
Who the people living in Dallas,
Texas right now getting dusted.

31
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:03,220
I with the poison. They're spraying
over at the Kel does mosquitoes,

32
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,660
the West Nile up camp there publicly.

33
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:11,070
Kim Trailing Dallas with some kind
of insecticide because these uh, uh,

34
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,780
mosquitoes there have West Nile virus.
Nine people have died so far. Oh Shit.

35
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,320
That's no fun. And there's
people were just writing
about it. Somebody just wrote,

36
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,660
Hey, let's do it. Let's get through
with this then we'll talk about that.

37
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,740
Let's get through this commercial
for, sorry, Ladies and gentlemen.

38
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,530
The Alpha brain has
got him speaking crazy.

39
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,140
He wants to get to this subject before
the commercials even over. He's insane.

40
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:38,010
Gotta go Duncan Trussell so there's a
lot to cover. We have so much to cover.

41
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,780
I'm new to [inaudible] dot com we have
this a hemp protein powder called hemp

42
00:02:42,781 --> 00:02:46,440
force, which is a amazing
naturally sweetened with Stevia,

43
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,620
Maca and raw cocoa or also in it.

44
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,730
And raw cocoa is a great antioxidant.
It's really delicious too.

45
00:02:53,731 --> 00:02:58,170
It's the best tasting protein over had
an though the easiest to digest because

46
00:02:58,171 --> 00:03:00,220
it's a hemp protein doesn't
make you feel bloated

47
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,780
at all. Your body has like a really
easy time digesting it. So I like it.

48
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:06,610
If I have to work out in like
an hour or something like that,

49
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:09,160
I can get away with it where I couldn't.
If like it's a whey protein,

50
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,560
I might get a little bit
more farty up in this cheese.

51
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:17,010
It's way it's way is like,
forget it.

52
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:21,340
It's like living inside a
coffin in my office. Yeah. Well,

53
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:25,900
your body's not really supposed to be
processing that kind of milk because it's

54
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:28,200
milk without all the digestive enzymes.
You,

55
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,240
you're supposed to drink milk only
from your mother, right? That's it.

56
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,470
But if you're going to drink milk from
an animal, cow's milk is the way to go.

57
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,460
Raw route, make sure they have an organic
diet of grass. They just eat grass.

58
00:03:39,461 --> 00:03:44,461
And then that milk is actually really
nutritious for you and it has built in

59
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,161
like there's,

60
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:49,630
there's enzymes in it and all this stuff
that gets killed when you pasteurize it.

61
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,690
And that stuff is what makes
it easier for you to tolerate.

62
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,790
So people who are lactose intolerant,

63
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,720
oftentimes if you get them
to drink natural milk, they
have no problem with it.

64
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,650
This is like, you know how like you
think of videos that you'd like to see,

65
00:04:02,651 --> 00:04:07,150
like if you got five videos that
you can see from any point in time,

66
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,810
you could go anywhere in time
and see like youtube clips.

67
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:16,380
I would give anything to see the
first man to drink milk from a cow.

68
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,560
That first person who figured
out that you can fucking do that.

69
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:22,160
Like I have so much to talk about.
Dude,

70
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,730
just get through this
commercial so that cause we're,

71
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:26,650
we're going to miss all the people
that listen to us on serious.

72
00:04:26,651 --> 00:04:28,570
They're not going to get
that part. Oops. They get,

73
00:04:28,571 --> 00:04:31,720
they come in complaining with
long ass fucking commercials.

74
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,830
I'm not that good at this.
This part. I'm not good at all.

75
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:38,300
i.com go get yourself some kettlebells.
Become a fucking manly man. All right.

76
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm talking clean presses,
Turkish getups get with its son.

77
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,270
If you want to get physically fit,
Carrington flips.

78
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:50,740
You want to fucking throw some strength
into your body and put a little pep in

79
00:04:50,741 --> 00:04:55,390
your step. Go get yourself some
kettlebells. Bodyweight squats,

80
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:59,230
Chin ups, kettle bells. You're
done. You don't need anything else.

81
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,820
Get three different ways to get a 35 of
50 when you're feeling cocky and a 70

82
00:05:03,821 --> 00:05:07,930
once your cock strong from doing
it for a while and you're good.

83
00:05:07,931 --> 00:05:12,310
You never have to buy any weights,
equipment ever done for life. Fuck a gym.

84
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,520
But then how are you gonna get laid?
Dugan didn't,

85
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,530
they didn't the guy tried to fuck you
regionally at the gym? No, no, no.

86
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,530
I tried to fuck a guy that, no, it didn't.

87
00:05:20,531 --> 00:05:23,620
The guy tried to like walk
into your car. Yeah, I was. Um,

88
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:29,690
it was really uncomfortable because it's
like they, the guys like, Hey, yeah,

89
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,760
can I walk into your car? Right. Like
it was like the end of the workout.

90
00:05:33,761 --> 00:05:37,780
Like no one's asked ever in
my life to walk me to my car.

91
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:44,380
It's so crazy the hunted, but my mind
tried to process it for us. It was like,

92
00:05:44,381 --> 00:05:47,530
well, can you know my car? Is it
like, oh, you're trying to fuck.

93
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,490
Oh God,

94
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,560
you want a quick little
sweaty fuck in your car?

95
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:58,070
Oh Jesus.
That's ball

96
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:01,640
bacteria that bombing. Oh,
back here. Have you seen,

97
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:05,920
did you see that reddit and the guy had
dipped his balls in a petri dish to grow

98
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,400
to see what Schick rue on it.

99
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:12,401
And it just flourished with bacteria
cause there's just a sea of bacteria on

100
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:13,724
every man's right.

101
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,230
Oh my God.
Anyway,

102
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,910
go to [inaudible] Dot com
o n n I t use a code name,

103
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:24,840
Rogan and save 10% off all supplements.
That's right.

104
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:29,280
Alpha brain, shroom tech, all that shit.
Code name, Rogan, save yourself 10%. Um,

105
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:33,990
and uh, the kettlebells and the battle
ropes, the 10% does not work on those.

106
00:06:33,991 --> 00:06:37,290
Those are being sold that literally
as chief as as humanly possible.

107
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,780
They're fucking awesome. Heavy
ropes. So like big thick, like,

108
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,670
like Siemens ropes. Ah, you know,

109
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:48,060
like one of those sure that you used to
fucking nautical ropes and shit. Yes.

110
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,010
Giant end. There's handles on
each wing and it's like, you know,

111
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,080
kept at the ends and you grab a hold of
them and you fucking whip him through

112
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:59,130
the air. I need to do it like in
sprints, like a 32nd sprint. Oh my God.

113
00:06:59,131 --> 00:07:01,830
It's ruthless to it. It's amazing.
It's incredible workout. Okay.

114
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,920
You guys are like bioengineering,
some army or something

115
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:10,750
happening. You're like selling
smart pills and bound to give people

116
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,870
smarter, stronger, more
aware with a big quarter.

117
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,263
It'd be no order.

118
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,500
There's also a no end of this commercial
because I don't have a fucking musical

119
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:25,560
player thing. I don't have one.
So let's fake it. [inaudible]

120
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,850
beginning battle ropes
now starts battle ropes,

121
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,110
Daca Trussell the fuck is going down.
Yeah.

122
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:40,410
You know I, I just, speaking of going
down, what's going on down is going on.

123
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,870
What's going on? I saw a, I
really, he's being in battle ropes.

124
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,080
I saw this very disturbing video today.

125
00:07:47,081 --> 00:07:51,460
Have you seen the thing about all dudes
with broad sorts chat chopping the heads

126
00:07:51,461 --> 00:07:56,080
off pigs? Whoa. No Way. It's fucking
weird dude. Cause they're like,

127
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,880
oh my God.
You know like warriors,

128
00:07:57,881 --> 00:08:01,030
they're just older guys that may
be a knife convention or something.

129
00:08:01,031 --> 00:08:02,080
I'm not sure what it is.

130
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:06,790
They have a broad sword and they're
just lopping off the heads of pigs.

131
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,310
Oh my God.
Like hanging upside down.

132
00:08:09,311 --> 00:08:12,420
Just lopping them off
and the fucking sword.

133
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:18,090
It really does demonstrate bloody
battles he used to be because they just,

134
00:08:18,881 --> 00:08:22,840
it's like they just slide right
through the neck of that fucking pig.

135
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,580
Just slide through like a knife through
butter and the sound is so gross.

136
00:08:27,581 --> 00:08:32,581
This flake foolish and these weird
old dudes just swinging these sores.

137
00:08:32,621 --> 00:08:34,900
It's fucking strange, man. Jesus Christ.

138
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:39,930
So glad that we got past that phase of
human history that got some of the events

139
00:08:39,951 --> 00:08:44,260
in a gun. Yeah. And that funny. I hate
if I got to choose, I'll take a gun,

140
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,940
I think. Yeah. Yeah, I'll take it.

141
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,560
I'm sure there's far less violence
today than there ever was when they were

142
00:08:49,561 --> 00:08:52,020
swinging swords around.
I'm sure it's like no comparison.

143
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:54,600
Well, yeah, I mean you could
just think how easy it was.

144
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,100
If you are a bad mood to kill

145
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:00,030
somebody. Back then there was no DNA
finger up. There's no fingerprints.

146
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,380
If you're just wandering through a town,
you just see a,

147
00:09:03,381 --> 00:09:07,620
a particularly plump young child
dragged that thing into the woods.

148
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,940
So why don't, why isn't it
weird? There's no amber alert.

149
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:16,710
That was not that long ago in
human history, you know? Oh no man,

150
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:21,210
we were just thinking of all humanity
is the, the humanity that preys upon.

151
00:09:21,211 --> 00:09:23,370
It's young.
It's like they're young,

152
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,700
they're youth was ruined and so
now they want to ruin you youths.

153
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:29,970
It's almost always the same story.
So it was a scary,

154
00:09:29,971 --> 00:09:34,050
frightening aspect of humanity.
You're talking about people that want to,

155
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,500
you know, abduct kids. Oh
yeah, yeah. But it's a,

156
00:09:37,501 --> 00:09:41,820
it's almost always comes from something
being done horrible to them. Well,

157
00:09:41,821 --> 00:09:45,480
yeah man, that's the opposite of this
thing called the disipling succession,

158
00:09:45,481 --> 00:09:48,270
which is this idea that people get super,

159
00:09:48,271 --> 00:09:53,070
super smart from time to
time by meditating or drugs
or something happens to

160
00:09:53,071 --> 00:09:57,960
them. And then those people like
transmit that to the closest friends,

161
00:09:57,961 --> 00:10:00,630
which gets transmitted down,
uh,

162
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:05,070
until it ends up in the present moment.
It's called the [inaudible] succession.

163
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,990
Um,
you know how like you get it right.

164
00:10:06,991 --> 00:10:09,930
It's like one thing to hear
someone from someone happy,

165
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,440
but when you get around someone who's
really advanced and really happy,

166
00:10:13,441 --> 00:10:16,090
you walk away with this
kind of like extra thing,

167
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:20,010
like get something into you know it
like they give you something from being

168
00:10:20,011 --> 00:10:25,011
around him so that the idea is that
certain times people have like a massive

169
00:10:26,971 --> 00:10:30,390
burst of that, you know, like the monkey
that came out of the tree or the monkey,

170
00:10:30,391 --> 00:10:34,200
the first used a certain tool or certain
people have that exact same kind of

171
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:37,740
like blast and the people in
the close proximity to them,

172
00:10:37,741 --> 00:10:41,490
they get it and it transforms them and
then they give it to the next person that

173
00:10:41,491 --> 00:10:44,070
goes through time.
The simplex succession in the same way.

174
00:10:44,071 --> 00:10:48,720
There's an opposite of that. There's
like a, an an anti uh, enlightenment,

175
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:53,460
anti happiness, just a foul
poison that started way, way,

176
00:10:53,461 --> 00:10:57,330
way back when and gets transmitted from
one person at the next to the next and

177
00:10:57,331 --> 00:11:02,331
this endless chain of shit that ends up
with like people doing monsters things.

178
00:11:03,391 --> 00:11:06,630
It's quite curious.
It's almost like a race between those two.

179
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,500
It's weird how pliable the
human consciousnesses, you know,

180
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:12,270
it's weird how the human consciousness,

181
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:15,870
depending upon how you're raised can be
thrust in so many different directions.

182
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,460
You know,
it's so weird.

183
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:22,490
Like we are so not like in
an easy thing to develop now.

184
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:26,370
We're like,
we really were super duper complicated.

185
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:31,050
We have all sorts of crazy emotions,
irrational ideas of the past,

186
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,590
irrational views of our own memory.
You know,

187
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:39,680
and we're all going through this whole
weird thing together trying to feel our

188
00:11:40,351 --> 00:11:44,640
way through it. Well he's completed.
We're so irrational. We're so,

189
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,360
it's such a strange animal.
Well it sucks man.

190
00:11:48,361 --> 00:11:53,361
And we've got these sedimentary layers
of of of times in history where you,

191
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:58,600
you are just being ravaged by
famine and disease and yeah,

192
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,600
it's fuck, it was rough man.
I mean if we think about that,

193
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:05,770
like even now people aren't safe and
you can call nine one one and a half,

194
00:12:05,771 --> 00:12:10,030
cops come to your house within 30 minutes,
you know, depending on where you're at.

195
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,560
Sometimes faster.

196
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,550
If something catches on fire dial nine
one one little red trucks come and put it

197
00:12:15,551 --> 00:12:19,870
out. They just trucks with water inside
of them. If there's no water around,

198
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:24,010
think about that. But not very long
ago Manson that catches on fire.

199
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:27,670
It's like that's shit's going
down. You know, if somebody,

200
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,950
if your friend hurts himself,

201
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:34,480
you're not calling nine one one you're
going to wrap him and like 30 bandages

202
00:12:34,481 --> 00:12:37,090
and just hope for the best.
It's like,

203
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,520
so that means that people,

204
00:12:39,521 --> 00:12:43,450
there's a lot of fear embedded into us
genetically from those times. You know,

205
00:12:43,451 --> 00:12:47,910
there's an angry little eight man living
inside everybody you can see anytime

206
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,970
you get mad you can. Yeah, that's him
howling out in the depths of your being.

207
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:53,900
You know, and yeah, there are differences.

208
00:12:53,901 --> 00:12:58,901
Some people still listen to that howling
eight freak who's like terrified and

209
00:12:59,501 --> 00:13:04,060
screaming out of the universe and believe
that that's them and they become that

210
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,160
crazy primal scared of being in.

211
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:09,910
Some people have started to realize are
completely realize that that's just one

212
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:13,420
old sort of a almost outdated appendage,

213
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:17,170
a psychic appendage stuck inside humans
and you don't have to listen to the

214
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,100
screaming fucking ape.
Every time something bad happens,

215
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:23,170
you can operate from another place.

216
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:28,280
Yeah. Yeah. You can. And mean
we're moving towards that.

217
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,040
As long as we can keep this
whole society thing together,

218
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,010
keep giving people food and purpose,
we can,

219
00:13:34,011 --> 00:13:38,330
we can slowly but surely make these leaps
into the next stage of consciousness

220
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:43,280
yet. So we got to keep
everybody fed. You know,

221
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,960
he'd riots from breaking out.

222
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:48,380
It's really hard to keep
rights from breaking out when
you're blatantly lying to

223
00:13:48,381 --> 00:13:50,750
people, you know? Yeah. That's a problem.

224
00:13:50,751 --> 00:13:54,300
This fucking Julian Assange
thing is really good.

225
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:56,030
It gives me the spooks man,

226
00:13:56,031 --> 00:13:58,460
because it's like you will explain to
the folks who don't know what the fuck's

227
00:13:58,461 --> 00:14:00,490
going on, what's happening.
So Julian Assan yeah. Launches

228
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:04,690
this. A guy created a website
card, wiki leaks and uh,

229
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:09,740
he was kind of the face behind this
a website that people send secrets,

230
00:14:10,271 --> 00:14:11,470
government secrets.

231
00:14:11,471 --> 00:14:16,471
People sent him a shit load of files
that showed a helicopter gunning down

232
00:14:16,991 --> 00:14:20,560
reporters among other
fuck that fangs. And, um,

233
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:25,990
so he, uh, he got in a lot of trouble
with the military industrial complex,

234
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:30,670
essentially just pissed off the
military industrial complex. He, um, he,

235
00:14:30,671 --> 00:14:34,600
uh, and ended up, cause it's
something happened in Sweden.

236
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:37,270
No one really knows exactly what it is,

237
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,530
but the UK is treating it like
whatever he did in Sweden,

238
00:14:41,531 --> 00:14:46,531
like he just went around fisting nuns
and setting fucking buildings on fire.

239
00:14:46,571 --> 00:14:49,690
Like they are doing everything to get
them back to Sweden for what I think is a

240
00:14:49,691 --> 00:14:54,290
relatively small charge. That's the
party line. I think it's called surprise,

241
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:58,250
surprise. Sachs. A very odd thing, man.
Like, yeah. And, and, and also men,

242
00:14:58,251 --> 00:15:01,790
I'm not to be a complete
fucking conspiratorial Weirdo,

243
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:05,510
but a lot of people say that
there are some basic things.

244
00:15:05,511 --> 00:15:08,150
If you want to get somebody,
uh, that you can do.

245
00:15:08,151 --> 00:15:11,390
And one of them is you set them
up with some kind of sex crime.

246
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,240
You know what I mean? You can, you can
entrap somebody. I'm not saying he's,

247
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:18,980
I don't know what happened, honestly.
But you know, in society now,

248
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:24,550
if you were running an empire and you
had an enemy and a really public enemy,

249
00:15:25,161 --> 00:15:27,440
it goes past the point where
you can just assassinate him.

250
00:15:27,441 --> 00:15:29,780
Like in the good old days,
like in the good old days,

251
00:15:29,781 --> 00:15:30,980
if someone had some information,

252
00:15:30,981 --> 00:15:34,970
you just fucking Sinan is one of your
assassins to come through their window and

253
00:15:34,971 --> 00:15:36,620
give them a quick snip on the throat,

254
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,680
leave your fucking Sigil
or whatever your sign was.

255
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,850
Because sometimes you want people to know
that your enemies die and that was it.

256
00:15:43,851 --> 00:15:47,210
Now assassination is a little
more complex. You know,

257
00:15:47,211 --> 00:15:49,820
you've got to like if someone
gets in the public eye,

258
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,940
they can't just suddenly hang themselves.
You know,

259
00:15:52,941 --> 00:15:57,020
if suddenly a song just dangling in the,
in the embassy there, they came into the,

260
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:02,030
in the, in the bathroom and assign just
hanging by a fucking rope wearing women's

261
00:16:02,031 --> 00:16:06,250
panties, right during women's
panties with maybe some caulking,

262
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,450
kitty porn scattered around.
We don't know.

263
00:16:08,451 --> 00:16:12,080
He just freaked out in there from the
stress and he tried to do auto erotic,

264
00:16:12,081 --> 00:16:14,900
a fixation cut to CNN,
CNN,

265
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,800
barely a peep about the libor scandal.
Boom pervert,

266
00:16:18,801 --> 00:16:23,060
pedophile asage found dangling in the
embassy wearing women's underwear,

267
00:16:23,061 --> 00:16:27,230
pink with Mickey mouse pictures on them.
You know what I mean? It's like that,

268
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:32,090
that's a way that they try to defame
you and make you seem like you were,

269
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:35,240
um,
not valid that you are,

270
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,890
no one should have been listening
to you in the first place.

271
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:39,950
That's one way to assassinate
somebody in this libor scandal.

272
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:43,430
What exactly is behind them? They were
adjusting the fucking interest rates.

273
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:47,300
They were like fucking with interest
rates, not not based on real reality,

274
00:16:47,301 --> 00:16:52,301
but based on the urgings of the
government from my complete low level

275
00:16:52,371 --> 00:16:56,150
understanding of this shit. But
basically it somehow is just, uh,

276
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:01,420
one of the indications of the things
that we hear all the time from some like

277
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:05,240
really hardcore can, you
know, as conspiracy theorists
who were saying that the,

278
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,250
the, uh, you know,

279
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,640
world economies are just being controlled
by bankers who are shifting numbers to

280
00:17:10,641 --> 00:17:12,650
benefit themselves.
You know,

281
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:17,800
and this is like of course the military
industrial complex or war quite often as

282
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:21,140
benefiting someone in a massive way,
you know,

283
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:24,680
so it's just part of that idea that the
way things are happening on the planet

284
00:17:24,681 --> 00:17:29,681
right now are based on some form form
of humanistic logic but are based on uh,

285
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:35,790
economic, um, the economic drives a very,

286
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:39,590
a very small amount of people and make
a shit load of money when bad shit goes

287
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:44,180
down. You know, like whenever
there's a fucking war,

288
00:17:44,181 --> 00:17:49,181
there are people who make
so much fucking money,

289
00:17:50,281 --> 00:17:53,820
man. I mean it's nice,
you know, like the way I,

290
00:17:53,821 --> 00:17:57,750
if like I fucking was the bucket,
like get my own TV show. Like if I,

291
00:17:57,751 --> 00:18:00,870
if I was able to sell a show, right,
that would be a big deal for me.

292
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,390
That'd be awesome. That'd be
an incredible moment. My life.

293
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,500
And that same way that I'm excited about
that. There's people who are like, oh,

294
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,540
come on, I ran say one more
antisemitic thing. Come on.

295
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:16,650
If we just get one more sign
that you want to attack Israel,

296
00:18:16,651 --> 00:18:19,590
we can fucking get in there.
And if we get in there,

297
00:18:19,591 --> 00:18:24,591
they're going to need a lot of mine
knew XP 49 double double edged fucking

298
00:18:24,751 --> 00:18:27,450
missiles and I'm going to
make a ton of money. You know,

299
00:18:27,451 --> 00:18:31,110
and those people have lobbyists that
talked to senators and congressmen and

300
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,320
their point is, the reason isn't for, um,

301
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,350
the reason isn't because it's like,
you know,

302
00:18:37,351 --> 00:18:39,090
I imagine it's like when
you're fucking a whore,

303
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,880
you know the reason she's
fucking you as for money,

304
00:18:41,881 --> 00:18:44,160
she's not fucking you cause she likes you.
She's fucking you.

305
00:18:44,161 --> 00:18:49,140
Cause she wants money from you in the same
way. These are, these are powerful. Uh,

306
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:54,030
uh, conglomerates are making moves that
are based on their own economic gain.

307
00:18:54,031 --> 00:18:58,260
I this doesn't obvious. I don't mean to be
so fucking obvious. Right. But you know,

308
00:18:58,261 --> 00:19:00,090
the idea was that,
I mean,

309
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:03,180
we were supposed to be shielded
from that. That was the idea. Yeah.

310
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,000
It wasn't supposed to be possible.
Yeah.

311
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:09,260
When that became possible
and an obvious and policy,

312
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,990
that's when the real problems
began as far, I mean,

313
00:19:11,991 --> 00:19:14,960
as far as like my own personal awareness,
when I started seeing it,

314
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,730
it became a much more blatant,

315
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
it seemed like later on in life and this
most recent supreme court ruling about

316
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:26,030
it where they said that corporations
can act as individuals. Right.

317
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,500
It's just insanity.

318
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:30,620
This is if she could just give as
much money as they want to give,

319
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:34,310
like you guys can work out a deal.
I'm going to be president it. Well,

320
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:37,040
how much do you want to give to my
campaign? How about 1 million bucks?

321
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,670
How would I love you? All right. I love
you too. And I work together. All right.

322
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,504
Give me some motivation.

323
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:46,440
Yeah. It's quite sad. It's a, um,
it's a sad situation. Uh, and, and um,

324
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:50,580
it's a strange situation. It's a
strange situation and uh, it's a,

325
00:19:50,581 --> 00:19:53,730
it's a situation that up until this point,
I mean,

326
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,840
it was pretty easy to hide
this shit. Yeah. You could
really control information.

327
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,800
Yeah. You can. People can just look in
their phone and fucking Google anything.

328
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:05,910
Yeah. It's almost like everybody's waking
up going, wait, what, what, what, what,

329
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:10,110
you know with what the effect reminds
me of Joe. I just fucking bought a TV.

330
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,450
I'm an American. I haven't had a TV
in so long. I went to fucking, um,

331
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,940
best buy and bought it. God Damn
One of those nights, logins.

332
00:20:17,941 --> 00:20:22,080
You try to be like Mr Bohemia
and I don't need a TV. It was,

333
00:20:22,081 --> 00:20:26,670
um, I don't know. Since I've been in
that fucking house, I am nine months.

334
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:31,450
The TV is awesome. Anybody who tells
you the TV's not awesome is an asshole.

335
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:35,810
No TVS. Awesome. No, I wasn't, I didn't
have a TV out of some hate for TV.

336
00:20:35,811 --> 00:20:39,710
I didn't have a TV because I understand
my composure and a plug that Xbox and

337
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,570
pop in Skyrim and just vanish
from society for four years. Yeah,

338
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,310
that's my problem. But the
thing about new fucking TV

339
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:51,700
is, um, the pictures too good.

340
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:53,680
It's too clear.

341
00:20:53,681 --> 00:20:57,250
It's like you watched the x men and it's
like seeing like people just walked out

342
00:20:57,251 --> 00:21:01,630
of like a, uh, I don't know, a
fucking West Hollywood aerobics class.

343
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,570
They just look too real. It
looks silly. It's too real.

344
00:21:04,571 --> 00:21:07,120
It something about the
pictures too. Good. Yeah.

345
00:21:07,121 --> 00:21:11,770
There's a different quality to it where
it makes old movies look like shit.

346
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,310
Yes. It's too good. It looks silly.
No one looked really bad, man.

347
00:21:15,311 --> 00:21:19,150
I saw aliens to the other day.
The, the movies still holds up.

348
00:21:19,151 --> 00:21:20,230
It's still a great movie,

349
00:21:20,231 --> 00:21:24,320
but there's some background scenes where
they had a painted spaceship. Yeah,

350
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:29,430
and it was so bad because it's so obvious
and not with the incubator with Hd.

351
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,671
So in the same way,

352
00:21:30,671 --> 00:21:34,660
it's weird because it's like that
technology is imitating I think what's

353
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:37,690
happening to people's
perception of things.

354
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:42,690
Somehow when a president starts doing
the presidential talk or when you see a

355
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:46,240
like what's happening in fucking the
UK where they're saying where the

356
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,280
[inaudible] no, no, no, no. Listen,

357
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,330
we have a right to what
we have to enforce this.

358
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:56,050
This is the deportation
of a sauna to Sweden.

359
00:21:56,051 --> 00:22:00,670
It is has nothing to do with a thing
where he leaked terabytes of information

360
00:22:00,671 --> 00:22:03,990
about the military industrial complex.
Nothing to do without that.

361
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,620
That's just a coincidence.

362
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:09,070
We've got to get him out to Sweden
because he did a surprise rate.

363
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,400
Now surprise sucks and pride.
It's a pride sex.

364
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,900
I guess it's kind of the same thing,

365
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:18,920
but what happened was they had had sex
and then he was in bed with her and then

366
00:22:19,031 --> 00:22:21,640
he had no condom. Can I stop
you for a second? Supposedly,

367
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:26,820
I want to apologize to everyone
that I just used the word Rape Dan,

368
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:31,540
so sorry. I said that word.
I will never use it again.

369
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:34,180
The words done.
I will never use that word.

370
00:22:34,181 --> 00:22:37,450
I've taken that word and I
have tied it to a fucking bad.

371
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:41,380
It's the new faggot rapist. The new
failure. I don't even mind neuro.

372
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:44,470
My neurological system
cannot process that word.

373
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:50,110
I don't even hear that word. I don't
hear any bad words. I've got a new,

374
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,250
I've got an, I've been taking
a, an a new fucking arm,

375
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:57,790
no tropic and makes it so that I can't
hear offensive words really can enjoy a

376
00:22:57,791 --> 00:23:02,791
comedy show cause nothing ruins a comedy
show more than when it comedians that

377
00:23:04,061 --> 00:23:07,270
something unethical or
immoral. Ooh, I hate it.

378
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:10,080
I'm just trying to have
a good fucking time. You,

379
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,840
I don't want to be lectured on what
you throwing your lefty beliefs my way.

380
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,810
Oh my lefty beliefs. No, no,
no. I'm saying to the comedian,

381
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,180
what's our hypothetical
comedian that we're just making
out? Yeah, I don't I, yeah,

382
00:23:22,181 --> 00:23:26,400
you comedian person blogger,
swamp toad helping.

383
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:34,060
We got our sold the mouth shut.
We got so the sinner's mouth shuts.

384
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:35,320
We can't let them speak.

385
00:23:35,321 --> 00:23:39,400
We can't let them talk about the things
that happen in the world. We don't like.

386
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:43,180
What is so weird about people
that they're so easy to program?

387
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,670
Like they're going to be programmed so
many ways and you gotta look at like

388
00:23:46,671 --> 00:23:50,300
people in North Korea like all
crying for real in the street.

389
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,920
When they did their dictated died.

390
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:55,910
I mean they were like for real legit crime
on the street and then look at people

391
00:23:55,911 --> 00:23:59,180
in America and seeing how much
different we aren't. Then you know,

392
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:02,380
the people in China, people
in India, it's so we're,

393
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,650
we're so adaptable and we're so
fucking variable. We're so different.

394
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:10,970
It's such as we have the strangest
fucking animal ever. We are a strange,

395
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:14,420
we are strange fucking creature man.
We went from background to foreground.

396
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,800
It's like all the,

397
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:21,130
it's like animals are so absorbed in
the nature when you watch a fucking

398
00:24:21,831 --> 00:24:26,780
squirrel running around and you see how
like in nature that thing is just part

399
00:24:26,781 --> 00:24:31,550
of the earth, almost just the earth.
Humans are like a few steps past that.

400
00:24:31,551 --> 00:24:33,830
So it's like we came out of a picture,

401
00:24:33,831 --> 00:24:37,010
we like came from the background
into the foreground. This is the,

402
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:38,630
this is the idea that uh,

403
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,370
they tried to metaphorically talk about
in the story of the garden of Eden,

404
00:24:43,371 --> 00:24:44,204
which is,
you know,

405
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:49,520
eat before they ate of the tree
of the knowledge of good and evil.

406
00:24:49,911 --> 00:24:53,630
They were unaware that they were naked.
It was like there more, more animals.

407
00:24:53,631 --> 00:24:57,050
And then this represents a, I
think Mckenna has said, you know,

408
00:24:57,051 --> 00:25:01,550
this is the representation of the,
uh, expansion to the neo cortex.

409
00:25:01,551 --> 00:25:05,720
This is the beginning of human brain
development is suddenly becoming aware of

410
00:25:05,721 --> 00:25:09,320
ourselves, of our bodies, of the
fact that we have a fucking body.

411
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:14,300
Cause you know, animals they don't
think about they're buttholes,

412
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:14,661
you know,

413
00:25:14,661 --> 00:25:18,680
like dogs aren't thinking about like
what their balls look like when they're

414
00:25:18,681 --> 00:25:23,300
running. They're not thinking about their,
their fucking hair. If it's messed up,

415
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,310
that doesn't cross their mind at dogs.

416
00:25:25,311 --> 00:25:28,280
Never worried about its
hair being messed up.

417
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:31,400
But humans like we fixate on that shit.

418
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:36,430
Like we spend so much time thinking about
how ashamed or ridiculously we proud

419
00:25:37,281 --> 00:25:39,050
we are of our bodies.

420
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:42,170
It's fucking hilarious how much time
you really consider how much time you

421
00:25:42,171 --> 00:25:45,570
fixate on your body one way or the other.
We're,

422
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:50,270
we're just into our bodies,
so yeah, man, that's this. Um,

423
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:55,220
that's one of the weird,
bizarre aspects of human being human.

424
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:59,270
As you're aware, you're aware of
all the stuff you like. You know,

425
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,850
you're aware of why you love, you
like you. It's a puzzle to you.

426
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:06,670
You see a woman with a thin waist and
then a big ass and big breasts and you're

427
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,760
like, you don't even know why there's
like, triggers are going off evolutions.

428
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:14,540
Like that's the shape you're looking for.
That's the shape you're looking for.

429
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,773
Calves,

430
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:21,100
calves from being accentuated by the
high heels and little fucking weird.

431
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:24,710
How weird is it that every woman
shaves her legs? Like you have to like,

432
00:26:24,711 --> 00:26:28,130
that's not really what their legs look
like. Especially girls with dark hair,

433
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:33,260
you know, any, anything like really,
uh, w will it be the word spicy?

434
00:26:33,261 --> 00:26:36,860
You know, and he like Greeks
or something along those lines.

435
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:40,700
Italians love those girls.
If they didn't shave their legs,

436
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,930
oh my God.

437
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:46,080
Do you know what kind of you'd be
looking at was the longest. See?

438
00:26:46,081 --> 00:26:50,490
Have you ever let your, your whole pubic
area grow before he trimmed it? Yeah.

439
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:53,130
Do you have a trim it? Yeah, I
trim it. But there have been long,

440
00:26:53,131 --> 00:26:56,700
long periods where I'm sure the
thing is just, if you look at it,

441
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,910
but it's just ridiculous. It's like all
over the place. It's just a cabinet chaos.

442
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,320
Chaos. Chaos. Yeah. But,

443
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:06,030
and then you imagine that
covering your entire body.

444
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:10,410
And that's what we used to be.
Just like a lot of people still are Bush.

445
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:14,280
Never see,
was it George George the Animal Steele?

446
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,040
Is that what's his name was so wrestler,
I think it was George,

447
00:27:17,041 --> 00:27:19,560
the animal steel something,
the animal Steele. And he was,

448
00:27:19,561 --> 00:27:22,830
he looked like a fucking gorilla.
He's the Harris human being ever.

449
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,550
And he was huge. He just as
big giant fucking, you know,

450
00:27:26,551 --> 00:27:31,020
superhuman muscles and hair covering
his whole body. Robin Williams.

451
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,070
Uh, this guy was more freaky. Robin
ones is pretty fucking Harry's. Yeah.

452
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:38,410
But this guy is built like a gorilla
to though, I mean it's like, it's like,

453
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:42,690
it's real close. I mean, he was,
he was in, um, one of those movies.

454
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:47,820
Um, one movie was, I feel
like he was in a movie.

455
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:52,170
I'm not remembering it right. Well
man, the thing, I think he did,

456
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,240
I think he had a career in like
horror movies or something.

457
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:59,220
We're very close to something that just,
it's no longer here anymore,

458
00:27:59,221 --> 00:28:03,630
but people's minds are still, some people
are still functioning at that level.

459
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,450
Uh,
and,

460
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:08,490
and in some people know that some people
are still functioning at that level and

461
00:28:08,491 --> 00:28:13,491
understand how the nervous system works
and are really good at tricking people.

462
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:15,480
You know,
cause once you're like,

463
00:28:15,481 --> 00:28:20,481
just like if you still identify with the
howling screaming animal inside of you,

464
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:23,950
yeah. You're really easy
to manipulate. You know,

465
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,630
it's not that hard to fucking trick
a monkey and going for a banana.

466
00:28:27,631 --> 00:28:32,190
It's like legendarily easy to
get a monkey to go for a banana.

467
00:28:32,191 --> 00:28:35,070
I want you to come over here and just
look at what George Steel looks like.

468
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,980
So you see what, what, what kind of
ridiculousness I'm talking about. Ha.

469
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:43,530
Can you imagine?

470
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:49,460
It doesn't look real huge
dude covered in hair and he's,

471
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:53,040
he's bent over looking at you like
he's about to charge like a solar back.

472
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:57,930
Looks like a stop motion character from
clash of the titans or sounds hilarious.

473
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:03,780
That's weird. And he did some
acting think it was in like,

474
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:07,950
yeah, he was in ed wood I
believe with Johnny Depp. Yeah.

475
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,010
And he it on a fucking
crazy looking and do,

476
00:29:11,011 --> 00:29:15,690
but he used to like eat the corner like
you live, whatever. I'll turn buckle.

477
00:29:15,691 --> 00:29:18,480
He would grab it and bite it and
start eating it and ripping it apart.

478
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:23,520
He was fucking crazy. What a weird
life that must have been. Huh?

479
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:27,930
We had a professional wrestler.
Yeah. That's a really weird life.

480
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,850
That's one of the weirdest aspects of
our culture ever. Professional wrestling.

481
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,600
You mean like worldwide wrestling,
world wrestling, entertainment.

482
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,360
I haven't watched while wrestling
since the great Kabuki man.

483
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:43,180
People still love it, dude. I was the
only, well it does really well. It's,

484
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:46,960
it's fucking crazy. What is it man? It's
like a form of fucking dance basically.

485
00:29:46,961 --> 00:29:50,110
Isn't it? Like it's like choreographed
fights. Yeah, they, you know,

486
00:29:50,111 --> 00:29:54,820
are fake but it's fucking hard to pull
off to it. And those guys getting beat up,

487
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,210
those guys are always throwing each other
down. Right. The Shit. But it's not,

488
00:29:58,211 --> 00:30:03,130
it's not real fighting. It's like a form
of gymnastics. Tumbling. What's a work?

489
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,630
You know? It is what it is. It's a hard,

490
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:07,570
they do what you call it would
call hard work or they really,

491
00:30:07,571 --> 00:30:11,200
they slap each other occasionally
they'll fucking, they'll close online,

492
00:30:11,201 --> 00:30:11,500
each other.

493
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,500
They really slam each other to the
ground and you could really get fucked up

494
00:30:14,501 --> 00:30:19,030
doing it. They all have like, you know,
back problems and shoulder problems.

495
00:30:19,031 --> 00:30:23,170
And the cool thing about it is not just
the fact that they're fake fighting,

496
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,010
it's that there is a narrative.
Yeah.

497
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:30,760
Weird ruin a rudimentary narrative that
runs through the fucking thing where

498
00:30:30,761 --> 00:30:34,090
they, everyone's has rivalries.
Yeah. And, and there's, uh,

499
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:39,240
there's always a villainous guy has
g like generally like supernatural

500
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:43,480
undertones. Like maybe he's come
from hell or something. Right.

501
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:46,810
There's like always that the taker,
yeah.

502
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:52,690
These mysterious men who've emerged from
like the darkest parts of the world,

503
00:30:52,691 --> 00:30:57,250
the slap each other's backs really hard.
When I was in high school,

504
00:30:57,251 --> 00:30:58,630
it was Bob Backlund,

505
00:30:58,631 --> 00:31:02,170
he was the champion and the big one was
that everybody wants to see fight for

506
00:31:02,171 --> 00:31:06,550
the title was Jimmy The superfly
snuck a Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

507
00:31:06,551 --> 00:31:07,331
And it was a big deal.

508
00:31:07,331 --> 00:31:11,260
Matt and he would put up his three
fingers like this and he would go,

509
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,580
I love you.

510
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:17,590
Those what he was telling everybody
when he had his fingers up,

511
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,790
I love you. And they fly
through the air. He would fall,

512
00:31:24,791 --> 00:31:27,190
lie through the air dude inland on guys.

513
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:30,370
And what a beating his body must've
taken doing that, man. I do.

514
00:31:30,371 --> 00:31:33,160
Do you ever did some ridiculous shit? I
remember when I was a kid. Yeah. Okay.

515
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:37,880
Getting into some fairly serious
arguments with people over whether or not

516
00:31:37,881 --> 00:31:40,690
wrestling was real. Oh, hook is
you, it'd be like, no, no, no.

517
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:43,700
This is fucking real dude.
Do you think this is fake?

518
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:46,190
You fucking think the great Kabuki,

519
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:50,750
like a guy could just blow steam out of
his mouth and poison a man. He's real.

520
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,240
You are getting these like deep,
oh yeah.

521
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:55,730
Before they had to admit it
was fake for like, right.

522
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:59,360
But you see that tax purposes,
you see it's still happening. See,

523
00:31:59,361 --> 00:32:02,390
this is the funny thing. It's
still fucking happening. Yeah.

524
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,460
Only now when you tell
somebody, you know, um,

525
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:10,010
our Congress is bought by corporations
and it's not really representing the

526
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:14,450
people anymore and you can, you cannot,
you, uh, you know, that's, um, that's,

527
00:32:14,451 --> 00:32:16,940
that's real.
It's pretty obvious by now.

528
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:21,560
You tell that to people and they'll
be like, no, it's real. It's real.

529
00:32:21,561 --> 00:32:26,000
It's real. It's the realest thing there
is. How could you say that's not real?

530
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,720
These men, these fine men,
not the high seats of power.

531
00:32:29,721 --> 00:32:33,920
They're not getting bribed
by corporations. No, never.

532
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:38,330
They have integrity yet again.
And again, time and time again,

533
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:42,260
we see that people have been supported
by lobbyists to the point where I saw

534
00:32:42,261 --> 00:32:45,110
someone, um, uh, put like on one of the,

535
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:48,180
I think one of the presidents or I
don't remember which it was. Maybe he's,

536
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,770
I don't remember who it was.
Maybe Baner the guy looks like howdy duty.

537
00:32:51,771 --> 00:32:52,700
I can't remember who it was,

538
00:32:52,701 --> 00:32:57,530
but put all their main corporate
sponsors like a NASCAR outfit. You know,

539
00:32:57,531 --> 00:33:00,530
like they said like senators and
congressmen should start having to wear,

540
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,220
I think Robin Williams had that in a
special, oh it dead. Is that what he said?

541
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:09,200
I saw a picture of it on the
Internet, but, but the, the, the, the,

542
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:12,260
the, it's the truth. But
there's still people who want,

543
00:33:12,261 --> 00:33:14,930
who don't want to believe
to believe that's the truth.

544
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,550
And this is the fucking problem man. Cause
it's not just politics, it's religion.

545
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:23,180
You, you, there's people. I just
have you seen this fucking I,

546
00:33:23,181 --> 00:33:24,650
it keeps popping up on the Internet,

547
00:33:24,651 --> 00:33:28,100
but it's like this idea that evolution
has had that the way some an or the

548
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:31,940
creation creationist believed that the
way some animals got from one continent,

549
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:36,990
the next is from graphs of the
forest sup rooted by the great flood.

550
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:43,310
So like bears and rabbits and squirrels
were just like floating across the ocean

551
00:33:43,311 --> 00:33:46,100
on logs.
Like they,

552
00:33:46,101 --> 00:33:49,600
people believe that stuck creation is at.
Dude,

553
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
imagine that just labs covered in
rabbits and puppies and eagles.

554
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,720
It's this craziest thing
fucking ever. But, but,

555
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,970
but people believe that right now.

556
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:02,231
Well,

557
00:34:02,231 --> 00:34:06,010
there have been guys who have invested
money to try to design and recreate the

558
00:34:06,011 --> 00:34:10,990
arc. How did thank you. If
could have worked. It's just
been dudes have done that.

559
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:15,940
Like there's some rich dude, I think he's
in Holland and these uh, recreating uh,

560
00:34:15,941 --> 00:34:20,941
an art right based on cubits and what
are the flood could ever fucking crazy

561
00:34:21,011 --> 00:34:23,380
measurement they use back
in when the Lord's work.

562
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,660
How many fucking lunatics right now?

563
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:30,220
How many crazy people right now in
neighborhoods and trailer parks across

564
00:34:30,221 --> 00:34:34,570
America are in their backyard constructing
an art cause they think God told him

565
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,470
to build an Ark.

566
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,880
I bet there's at least 400 people right
now hammering in their backyard on a

567
00:34:39,881 --> 00:34:43,870
fucking arc because they had a weird
dream. Our God told them to build an Ark.

568
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:47,260
There's definitely more than one. I've
definitely heard of more than one person.

569
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:52,180
Talk about grandiose. Imagine you thinking
you're really Noah, but that's like,

570
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,150
you know if your cuckoo for
cocoa puffs, that's a, that's a,

571
00:34:55,151 --> 00:34:59,030
that's an entertaining one. You think
you think you're Noah? Oh my God. I mean,

572
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,190
but dude, imagine if like your fucking
brain speaking to me. Wait, what?

573
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,840
Hope what Joe?

574
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:09,860
It is high the Lord. I'm going to
flood the planet because I'm pissed.

575
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,580
That's why I always thought it's hilarious
when you see like a fake seance or a

576
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:17,720
seance. It looks like obviously full
of Shit. Hold on, I'm getting a signal.

577
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:23,200
He saying he's saying there's
a hole or his heart used to be.

578
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:28,610
What does that mean? Does anyone know
what that means is speaking to me.

579
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:33,670
I just fucking saw on Trinity Broadcasting
Network. If you ever watched TBN. Yes.

580
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:38,010
So I just saw some remedy broadcasting
network. This fucking televangelists say,

581
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:42,810
do you want that new house?
Do you want that new condo?

582
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:47,370
That $2,000 isn't going to get
you a condo or a new house.

583
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:52,610
Plant that seed money in my ministry
and it will come back to you 10 fold.

584
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:58,350
A hundred fold.
So this guy is on Tbn,

585
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:02,730
compelling people who've been saving
up their money to buy a house,

586
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:07,500
to send that money to
his fucking ministry.

587
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:13,370
He's tricking dumb asses and just
funneling money to him in the idea that

588
00:36:14,941 --> 00:36:18,000
they're going to send $2,000
and because he says it,

589
00:36:18,001 --> 00:36:22,140
it's so terrible what he does. He's
like Trump. He's aiming it though.

590
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,970
If people like, uh, illegal
immigrants, one of the things
he said is, ah, you know,

591
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:31,890
won whoever since $2,000 to me,

592
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:34,500
his green card had already been denied,

593
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:39,450
but he went to the mailbox and you got
a letter underneath his bills and he

594
00:36:39,451 --> 00:36:42,480
opened that letter and it
said he had been accepted,

595
00:36:42,481 --> 00:36:44,220
his green card had been accepted.

596
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:49,350
So you're like trying to hit these like
the most desperate humans who are like

597
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:51,960
as a combination,
desperate and dumb,

598
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:55,770
watching TV late at night and they
just have a little bit of money left,

599
00:36:55,771 --> 00:36:58,800
but maybe they're a little drunk.
Oh, you're like, yeah, this is it.

600
00:36:58,801 --> 00:36:59,730
This is what I need to do.

601
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:04,500
This is what I fucking need
to do on giving money to
the Ministry of father fuck

602
00:37:04,501 --> 00:37:07,750
face and it's going to come back.
It's crazy

603
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,980
doing that. That's seeding.
That's pretty recent.

604
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,290
That used to be just a donation thing,

605
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:17,430
but then someone came up
with the brilliant idea of
saying that you're planting

606
00:37:17,431 --> 00:37:20,010
seeds and that you get it back.

607
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:23,130
Well let's see the pause and just
a donation anymore. It became like,

608
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:26,100
you know what I mean? Like it wasn't
like that for a while, for a while,

609
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:30,160
donations, but the problem
is, man, with all this stuff,

610
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,630
this is where religion gets confusing.

611
00:37:31,631 --> 00:37:34,540
It's a lot of the metaphysical principles
these people were throwing out there.

612
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,980
They're real. If you put good energy out
into the world, it does come back to you.

613
00:37:38,981 --> 00:37:41,770
It is true. If you put, if you
put good things out in the world,

614
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:45,100
it's like throwing a fishing line out
and it was a really good chance you're

615
00:37:45,101 --> 00:37:48,340
going to reel back something awesome
that you didn't expect to get,

616
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:50,260
but it's like these sons of bitches,

617
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:55,180
they're like making it as though there's
an actual spiritual economy in the

618
00:37:55,181 --> 00:37:57,010
universe where if you did,

619
00:37:57,011 --> 00:38:02,011
there's some kind of new quantifiable
bank account balance where if you send

620
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:07,470
2000 you'll get 20,000 based
on some specific crazy laws.

621
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:11,740
That's, that's where it gets
odd and that's where it's
kind of fucked up because

622
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:15,790
it isn't. It isn't because the wounded
antelopes have always been jacked by the

623
00:38:15,791 --> 00:38:18,190
waterholes. That's just the
way it always been. Have.

624
00:38:18,191 --> 00:38:21,010
You're so fucking dumb that you think
that that guy's really going to be able to

625
00:38:21,011 --> 00:38:24,300
do that with your mind.
It's almost like you're,

626
00:38:24,301 --> 00:38:28,970
you have to exist as an example of folly.
You have to exist as a,

627
00:38:28,971 --> 00:38:33,320
as an example of like when anybody gets
scammed by one of those Nigerians. Yes.

628
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,550
One of them, I watched this
one thing were talking about,

629
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,890
it was a dude who was really sad, man. The
guy just didn't have any companionship.

630
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,750
He didn't, didn't,
didn't have a girlfriend,

631
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:44,630
really wanted a girlfriend and it just
spent all his retirement money sending it

632
00:38:44,631 --> 00:38:48,460
to this Nigerian scammer,
went to Europe to meet this chick twice,

633
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:53,600
twice, twice. You kind of broke down
during the shower. Brutal because

634
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:59,040
he, his Pr, his daughter or someone had
to tell him that the woman wasn't real.

635
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,570
Someone close to him who was trying to
explain to him at the moment wasn't real,

636
00:39:03,571 --> 00:39:06,430
but he just wanted to believe he
went to Europe twice to meet her,

637
00:39:06,431 --> 00:39:10,410
do it twice and like she said,
she couldn't find him. Oh my God.

638
00:39:10,411 --> 00:39:14,820
I'm getting called back by my family.
Right. And this poor fucking guy bid it,

639
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:15,960
but it hook,
line and sinker.

640
00:39:15,961 --> 00:39:18,510
And everybody spoke to her
and just kept sending money.

641
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:18,851
See,

642
00:39:18,851 --> 00:39:22,360
it's really cool mag because we keep
going back to talking about believing in

643
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:24,790
bullshit and the effect
that it has on your life.

644
00:39:24,791 --> 00:39:28,600
The immediate detrimental effect it
has on your life to believe bullshit.

645
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:32,260
No matter what the fucking thing is,
it always fucks up your life.

646
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:35,200
Whatever the fuck it is.
If you believe in something that's crap,

647
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,110
you end up making decisions based on crap.

648
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:42,850
And so you've just summon more and more
negativity into your life from believing

649
00:39:42,851 --> 00:39:45,730
in bullshit now where it
gets fucking weird man.

650
00:39:45,731 --> 00:39:50,731
And where like there's a part of me that
is always combating what the apparent

651
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:56,790
violent and brutal merciless aspect
of nature with my own instinct to want

652
00:39:58,781 --> 00:40:01,020
everybody to be okay. And, and like,

653
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:05,530
those two things are really fucking
confusing for me because you look out into

654
00:40:05,531 --> 00:40:10,030
the world, you know, and you, you see
any on the nature channel just, you know,

655
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:14,920
watch a fucking hyena taking a bath and
the carcass of a fucking elephant or

656
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:19,540
watch fucking, uh, those, those tigers
in the Russian circus. You just attack.

657
00:40:19,541 --> 00:40:24,120
Those dudes are look at the
fucking, um, uh, in China though,

658
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:28,930
the monstrous way that they're, you
know, slice the skin off of living dogs.

659
00:40:28,931 --> 00:40:32,930
Or you can go on and on with
examples of this kind of brutal,

660
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:37,720
the slaughter houses everywhere, you know?
Right. The brutality of nature, you know,

661
00:40:37,721 --> 00:40:38,441
and, and, and, and,

662
00:40:38,441 --> 00:40:43,030
and you can go into this Nietzschean
mind state where you're like, you know,

663
00:40:43,031 --> 00:40:47,860
yes, that is, that is as much a part
of the universe as anything else.

664
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:52,090
And then there's another part of you
that if you start thinking that way can

665
00:40:52,091 --> 00:40:56,830
become a bit, uh, a bit nihilistic
where you start thinking like, oh,

666
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:00,730
well, if there's a wounded antelopes,
then why help them, you know what I mean?

667
00:41:00,731 --> 00:41:03,700
But let let them suffer
for their own good.

668
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:07,600
Let them come to understand life through
their own transgressions that they can

669
00:41:07,601 --> 00:41:11,110
grow on their own and become
powerful by their own volition.

670
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:15,040
And that's fucking cool, man. There's
part of me that really loves that idea.

671
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,270
And then there's another part that's
like, yeah, but what if, you know,

672
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,680
there's an actual concerted
effort at work right now,

673
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:28,770
a concerted effort by a
kind of a combination of
many different conglomerates

674
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:35,221
who have recognized the psychological
makeup of most human beings in and figured

675
00:41:35,961 --> 00:41:39,350
out very intelligent ways to intentionally
manipulate those human beings to

676
00:41:39,351 --> 00:41:44,240
become consumeristic so that
they can gain at, uh, from,

677
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:46,970
from these people's lack of
education and understanding.

678
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:51,010
I think you're very educated.
People are often consumeristic as well.

679
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:55,900
I think consumerism is a byproduct of
work and doing a lot of work that you

680
00:41:55,901 --> 00:41:57,580
don't really want to do.
It makes,

681
00:41:57,581 --> 00:42:01,420
it makes you want to buy things when you
go enjoy buying things when they work.

682
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,830
That's part of it.
But this is like from this,

683
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:07,590
I think we've talked about this before,
the century of the south, about the, uh,

684
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:12,470
what's called black psychology
or the, uh, the, um, uh,

685
00:42:12,471 --> 00:42:16,270
using psychology been to manipulate
people into buying shit or giving them

686
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,200
ration that they need
something, right? So it's like,

687
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:21,370
but it's an art form that
they've almost got down to us

688
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:22,530
and it's a necessity.

689
00:42:22,531 --> 00:42:26,190
If you're going to have a successful
economy in a capitalist country,

690
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,080
you got to keep selling shit,
right?

691
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:30,240
You don't want to make something
that's going to last forever,

692
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,010
but how do we regulate
it? Do we do, we do,

693
00:42:34,011 --> 00:42:38,360
we just let it happen so that you can
have preachers that you can have like

694
00:42:38,361 --> 00:42:41,420
those crazy guys on TV saying that if you
send any money, I'll give you 10 times.

695
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,010
Do we just let that happen? I mean,
what, what if you were a, a few,

696
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,210
we're inclined to decide,
you know,

697
00:42:47,211 --> 00:42:51,770
if you had to cast your vote one way
or another, what, how much do we limit?

698
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:55,220
Well, no. Yeah. All right. I'm
sorry. I just want to say like,

699
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:57,980
because if that guy's not legitimate,
okay,

700
00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:00,260
what if something comes
along that is legitimate?

701
00:43:00,261 --> 00:43:03,010
What if there's some
sort of sustainable new,

702
00:43:03,011 --> 00:43:07,280
a environment that's being built and they
want everybody to throw some money in

703
00:43:07,281 --> 00:43:10,000
and become a part of it
and uh, you know, and,

704
00:43:10,001 --> 00:43:13,190
and the offer you like a tangible deal
and it's based on the same sort of

705
00:43:13,191 --> 00:43:14,150
spiritual concepts,

706
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:18,200
you're going to automatically connect
it with those other assholes. Well, no,

707
00:43:18,201 --> 00:43:20,600
I know. This is the prop man. I
mean, this is, I can't stop it.

708
00:43:20,601 --> 00:43:23,080
You know what I'm saying?
It's like you couldn't stop it because it,

709
00:43:23,081 --> 00:43:25,500
you would limit stopping it
for a real pool. Going to

710
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,650
stop it too. Yeah. He was
going to make the decisions.
Who is going to say, no, no,

711
00:43:28,651 --> 00:43:28,800
no.

712
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,320
This is the right thing and that's the
wrong thing and this is good and that's

713
00:43:31,321 --> 00:43:36,170
bad. It's like, it's almost,
uh, uh, I only an EGOMANIAC,

714
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:39,570
whatever even consider the notion
of trying to take charge, you know?

715
00:43:39,571 --> 00:43:42,040
And so it is this, you know, we,

716
00:43:42,041 --> 00:43:45,120
we ended up in this curious predicament
of trying to determine, okay,

717
00:43:45,121 --> 00:43:47,550
well then how much do we let happen?
For example,

718
00:43:47,551 --> 00:43:50,940
what's happening in Syria right now?
How much do we let happen?

719
00:43:50,941 --> 00:43:55,410
How many more people get fucking bombed
in this weird war between an oppressive

720
00:43:55,411 --> 00:43:58,590
regime and the people who are rising up?
And it is an oppressive regime.

721
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:02,430
The guy's been at, like, the guy's been
around too long. The elections are fucked.

722
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:06,930
It's, Siri has always been notoriously,
it kind of fucked up place.

723
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:11,490
It's like now there's a civil
war happening. So how much do we,

724
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:16,310
who's it, who takes the side of, you
know, right? Who takes the side of Assad?

725
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:19,170
That's his name, right? Assad.
What? Who takes his side?

726
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:22,630
Who's really going to stand up for that
fucking guy? You know what I mean? And,

727
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,830
and, and I'll tell you one person
who is Russia, you know what I mean?

728
00:44:25,831 --> 00:44:29,130
So Russia is standing up for this guy.
Now we're in a weird situation.

729
00:44:29,131 --> 00:44:31,950
I don't know how much they're supporting,
but the,

730
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,500
that's where things get fucked
up because it's like, okay,

731
00:44:34,501 --> 00:44:37,260
I guess we just back off and let a
bunch of people get slaughtered because

732
00:44:37,261 --> 00:44:39,830
that's the way of the world.
This is like, you know,

733
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,690
the hardcore libertarians believe this.
I think Ron Paul's like,

734
00:44:42,691 --> 00:44:43,830
this isn't our business.

735
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,440
Well, his, his also,

736
00:44:45,441 --> 00:44:48,830
his contention is that we've created a
lot of business that we shouldn't have

737
00:44:48,831 --> 00:44:49,664
created.

738
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:54,080
We've made things our business and things
we've had blow back because of things

739
00:44:54,081 --> 00:44:56,150
that we've done that we shouldn't
have been doing in the first place.

740
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,370
The idea of a policing the world.

741
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,430
Yes, that's a problem.
And we definitely split,

742
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:04,770
put our fucking dicks and
a great many Hornet's nest,
but it's like the, the, the,

743
00:45:04,771 --> 00:45:07,560
uh, but if you look at it from like
a perspective of just you, you're,

744
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:08,970
you're getting your apartment,
right?

745
00:45:08,971 --> 00:45:13,050
You're in your apartment
and two doors away,

746
00:45:13,051 --> 00:45:15,860
someone starts screaming bloody murder,
right?

747
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:17,120
He's fucking,

748
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:24,960
oh, Jesus. What do you do? What do you do?

749
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:27,330
Are you going to fucking
call nine one one?

750
00:45:27,331 --> 00:45:29,310
Of course you're going to try to help.
To,

751
00:45:29,311 --> 00:45:31,920
maybe you're maybe going to go over there
and see if you can fucking help this

752
00:45:31,921 --> 00:45:36,780
person. Right? So now all of
a sudden there, let's spread
the radius out, you know,

753
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:40,170
two buildings down that's happening to
someone. Now, let's spread it out more,

754
00:45:40,171 --> 00:45:44,010
you know, two miles away at a certain
time, someone's going to get fucking hurt.

755
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:47,010
How, when do you stop helping? Yeah.

756
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:50,010
And right now it appears that when you
stop helping [inaudible] is when it's

757
00:45:50,011 --> 00:45:53,830
outside the fucking, uh,
boundaries of your country.
At that point you're like, no,

758
00:45:53,831 --> 00:45:54,664
no, no, no, no, no.

759
00:45:55,110 --> 00:46:00,110
It is the way of the world that people
are slaughtered by mortars in guns and

760
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:04,350
executions and dragged into secret
prisons. It's the way of the world.

761
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:07,980
And then it's a really weird fucking
situation because it's like, well,

762
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:12,480
it's also the way of the world to get
people out of fucking secret prisons and

763
00:46:12,481 --> 00:46:16,740
to help people who are in trouble. You
know, it's the story of our fucking,

764
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:20,010
you know, our history, the damn
the French helped us, you know,

765
00:46:20,011 --> 00:46:24,180
it's like sometimes people need help.
When do you help?

766
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:26,250
It's a real fucking question.
It's a real,

767
00:46:26,251 --> 00:46:29,550
it's one of the big questions
facing us right now.

768
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:33,900
It's like when do you do something,
you know, like if a in the UK,

769
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:38,670
if they fucking storm into the equity,

770
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:42,360
the embassy that Eh, the
Ecuadorian embassy. Do you
say? What does the Ecuadorian,

771
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:44,610
yeah,
they storm into that fucking thing.

772
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,760
Breaking the sovereignty of Ecuador,

773
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:52,050
which is essentially invading Ecuador
if you go into a fucking awesome. Yeah.

774
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:55,020
So in that case,
obviously when they,

775
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:58,320
if they just fucking start
throwing out the whole game, yeah.

776
00:46:58,600 --> 00:46:59,790
Or that it's gotten where they're like,
you know,

777
00:46:59,791 --> 00:47:03,450
we're just going to do what we want and
what will for as long as it suits this

778
00:47:03,451 --> 00:47:06,480
will make it seem like there's laws
in place here, right? Well, no,

779
00:47:06,481 --> 00:47:10,530
it comes down to it.
We're going to fucking do what we want.

780
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:13,890
Isn't that kind of crazy that you got it
like a whole building that's different

781
00:47:13,891 --> 00:47:17,790
country and that building has sovereignty
in this cat can go there and say,

782
00:47:17,791 --> 00:47:19,770
can I get asylum? And they're
like, yes. Good, cool.

783
00:47:19,771 --> 00:47:23,400
I'm staying here and now you're
still like, wait, hold up and wait.

784
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:26,340
He came mentioned with the
stress of being in asylum.

785
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:30,140
Can you imagine the stress
of being Julian? Uh,

786
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,820
it's a must be unbearable.
I mean the guy, he's crazy,

787
00:47:33,821 --> 00:47:36,880
but he has a giant Paul's
giant, giant, giant

788
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:40,500
dude. That guy's going to be remembered
as one of the great heroes, man.

789
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:43,440
That son of a bitch, that
poor fucking bastard. Nobody.

790
00:47:43,441 --> 00:47:46,140
That guy made a real goddamn
sacrifice cause like,

791
00:47:46,141 --> 00:47:48,370
I don't care how much money
he was making from wikileaks.

792
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:51,780
I don't care if he was making a fuck
load of money for Wiki leaks, man.

793
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,360
He knew when he wait,
leak those documents.

794
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,110
Do you realize like when you get that
much fucking information that shows that

795
00:47:58,111 --> 00:47:59,610
some fucked up shit is going on.

796
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:03,930
The moral responsibility to ethical
you are responsibility you have at that

797
00:48:03,931 --> 00:48:08,160
moment. Because you know that the moment
you wet this shit out, you're fucked.

798
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:13,080
Right? Forget it. Forget it. Game over.
You've made the decision like, all right,

799
00:48:13,081 --> 00:48:16,320
I'm going to fucking throw myself on the
fire in this incarnation just because

800
00:48:16,321 --> 00:48:20,130
it feels better than sitting back and
festering with the knowledge that there's

801
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:23,760
fucking innocent people getting
gunned down for no goddamn reason.

802
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,880
And that's being kept away from the
people who are funding the fucking bullets

803
00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:30,750
blowing up their heads. You're like,
God damn it, I've got to fucking do it.

804
00:48:30,751 --> 00:48:32,730
And you do it and you're a bad ass.

805
00:48:32,731 --> 00:48:34,850
And then you end up fucking
hold up and the guy,

806
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:39,030
a God damn embassy and you know that
even if you do get out of that embassy,

807
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:44,210
even if 50,000 Guy Fawkes mask
wearing anonymous vigilantes,

808
00:48:45,001 --> 00:48:47,820
the send on that embassy
all wearing the same outfit,

809
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:51,900
swarm the fucking embassy and give you
the outfit to wear so that you just mix

810
00:48:51,901 --> 00:48:53,850
in with all of them and
vanish into the fucking,

811
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:56,760
into the darkness and then end
up in fucking Ecuador. You know,

812
00:48:56,761 --> 00:49:00,660
at one point there's going to be a moment
when you wake up and there's the guy

813
00:49:00,661 --> 00:49:03,630
sitting next to your bad and he's like,
hey man,

814
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:07,680
I'm sorry but I got to
fucking kill your ass.

815
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,160
Or maybe it doesn't say anything or
maybe they poison you or maybe there's a

816
00:49:11,161 --> 00:49:14,190
fucking moment when you walked down the
street and you feel a strange prick in

817
00:49:14,191 --> 00:49:17,520
the bottom of your leg. And the next
thing you know, you get a weird sickness,

818
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:22,020
a form of fucking swine flu or
some odd bacterial infection.

819
00:49:22,021 --> 00:49:22,854
You just fucking die.

820
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,130
So tell me more about what's
going on in in Dallas. I,

821
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:30,010
it's a West Nile outbreak,
apparently nine people dive now there.

822
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:30,860
When did this happen?

823
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:34,430
I don't know when the outbreak happened
and I kind of like keep my eyes peeled

824
00:49:34,431 --> 00:49:37,760
for any kind of like end of the
world style plague reports. But yeah,

825
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:39,320
it seemed to pop out of nowhere.

826
00:49:39,321 --> 00:49:42,260
Just eight people in Dallas
came down with West Nile

827
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:46,330
really recently. Yeah. Really
recently. I dusted there.

828
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:47,680
I think they're dusting today.

829
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:51,370
Jesus Christ just spraying out
that fucking poison, you know,

830
00:49:51,371 --> 00:49:55,520
because they don't want the
West Nile virus to spread. Yeah.

831
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:58,150
The Texas gets fucking funky hot man.

832
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:03,160
And apparently I'm Aubrey said that
they've had a record amount of days.

833
00:50:03,390 --> 00:50:06,040
They're, they're cruising on
the, the, the current record,

834
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:07,690
which is like some crazy number,

835
00:50:07,691 --> 00:50:11,650
like 50 something days
of over 100 degrees,

836
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:16,780
hottest fucking summer in history,
man. It's weird, man. It's weird.

837
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,760
You know, we were talking about, um,

838
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:23,350
like lakes drying up and rivers are drying
up and shit like that. Yeah. That's a,

839
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:28,340
that's a disturbing thought, man.
That, that the climate can shift

840
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:32,860
like really radically. Yeah. And it
always has, always had, always had us,

841
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:36,890
our ideas that we're going to be able to
stay in this one spot that we so choose

842
00:50:36,891 --> 00:50:41,420
to set up shop in. That might be silly.
There might be a silly thing to do. Yeah.

843
00:50:41,421 --> 00:50:45,260
It's like, as a species, we do this thing,
same thing people do as an individual,

844
00:50:45,261 --> 00:50:47,710
like as a species, we make the silly, uh,

845
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:51,290
like we have this crazy idea that
everything's gonna stay the same. Yeah.

846
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:55,400
The planet's gonna always be
hospitable to our former life. And uh,

847
00:50:55,401 --> 00:50:57,510
we've just live with that. And
the same way that from, you know,

848
00:50:57,650 --> 00:51:00,860
individuals go around like they're
going to lift fucking forever.

849
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:04,820
They go around treating people like shit,
not returning phone calls, you know,

850
00:51:04,821 --> 00:51:07,160
they'd go around like being
like complete conscious. Those,

851
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:10,910
there's going to be something fun
to treat people shit. Fucking,

852
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:16,040
I don't return phone calls.
No funny that is pissing my brother.

853
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:21,410
Uh, all, all the horrible shit you
could have said someone does like, yeah,

854
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:25,210
people are fucking dog shit.
I love returned.

855
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:27,530
My brother is like,
I love him very much.

856
00:51:27,531 --> 00:51:29,690
He's like one of my best
friends on a fucking planet,

857
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:32,760
but he's found somebody that
he really loves and it's great.

858
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:37,560
It's really
so he's like,

859
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:39,890
he's like absorbed into this,
this

860
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:42,140
beautiful thing that I'm
very happy for him for it.

861
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:45,560
But it's like that classic thing on one
of your best friends gets a girlfriend.

862
00:51:45,561 --> 00:51:49,550
You're like, fuck, I understand.
I've done it. God knows I've done it.

863
00:51:49,551 --> 00:51:52,820
I've been the king of that Shit,
man. It's horrible. But the point is,

864
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:58,970
people treat their lives, and
I've tried, tried to do this last.

865
00:51:58,971 --> 00:52:02,730
Now sometimes people get
caught up in like the, this,

866
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:06,840
the minutia and they ended
up, they end up, uh, uh,

867
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:11,480
discounting their existence is though
there's going to be some point 10 years

868
00:52:11,481 --> 00:52:12,840
from now, a lot of people
think, okay, you know,

869
00:52:12,850 --> 00:52:16,200
I'm just going to fucking party through
my twenties and then your 20s paths and

870
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:19,350
then 30 seconds I got stills,
got some juice in mistake,

871
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:23,870
I'm going to just fucking do it through
my thirties and then your thirties pass

872
00:52:23,871 --> 00:52:27,620
and now you're feeling a little tired and
fucked up a little bit in your forties

873
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:30,410
comment and you're like,
under the forties,

874
00:52:30,411 --> 00:52:33,410
I'm going to settle down and I'm
going to really become a man.

875
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:36,930
And then you just Keel over and die and
that's it. You never fucking did you not,

876
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:40,310
you never actualize yourself.
You never jumped into the,

877
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:44,420
you never jumped into the fucking fray.
You know what I mean?

878
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:48,070
So in the same way as a species,
it's like we're,

879
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:51,860
we're in that situation where we've, we
think, yeah, well it'll be fine, man.

880
00:52:51,861 --> 00:52:56,510
There's infinite fucking resources. Woo.
Come out. And it's, you know, and now,

881
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:59,090
now we're kind of like in that
part where you look in there,

882
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:03,200
you flip the fucking hotel mirror a little
bit and take a look at that pink moon

883
00:53:03,201 --> 00:53:06,170
sprout. And in you're in the back
of your fucking head. What the fuck?

884
00:53:06,171 --> 00:53:10,130
There's a patch of pink. They're in the
same way. There's like nice big thick,

885
00:53:10,131 --> 00:53:11,630
black,
oily patches,

886
00:53:11,631 --> 00:53:16,100
a death sprouting up all over the
planet from people logging and Dumping

887
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:17,480
Chemicals in there. And like, no,

888
00:53:17,481 --> 00:53:21,950
it'll come around that little fucking
radioactive patch called Chernobyl.

889
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:26,550
We'll come around.
It'll be fine in a couple thousand years.

890
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:31,170
You know what I mean? It's like I'm
not even no Fukashima. We'll be fine.

891
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:35,700
It'll be fine. That's not getting, that
won't affect the rest of the planet.

892
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:40,380
Why was it so crazy? Yeah,
it's fucking crazy. So,

893
00:53:40,381 --> 00:53:43,020
so this is where we have
this fucking problem, man,

894
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:47,580
because we've got a group of people who
believe that rabbits floated on rafts

895
00:53:47,581 --> 00:53:49,050
from one continent to the next.

896
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:53,280
We've got a group of people who really
fucking believe in some very archaic,

897
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:56,700
primitive bullshit and we're really
letting them run with it. Man.

898
00:53:56,701 --> 00:54:00,330
We're really letting them run with
that. You're, you're supposed to,

899
00:54:00,331 --> 00:54:01,320
if you're polite,

900
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:05,340
to allow them whenever craziness
they believe without ever arguing it,

901
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:09,270
ever discussing it or ever disagreeing
with it. Yeah. And it's fun. It's like,

902
00:54:09,271 --> 00:54:13,140
it's fine. Okay man. Fucking believe that
shit. I don't care. I really don't care.

903
00:54:13,141 --> 00:54:14,970
And if it makes you happy,

904
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:18,930
I really do mean God bless you
and I'm happy. You're happy,

905
00:54:18,931 --> 00:54:20,010
that's fucking awesome.

906
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:23,940
But if you're making political
decisions based on these belief systems,

907
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:28,140
well we got a fucking problem,
man. We got a big fucking problem.

908
00:54:28,141 --> 00:54:31,860
Cause you're making political decisions
based on an imaginary voice in your

909
00:54:31,861 --> 00:54:36,180
fucking head that thinks that a floating
man's going to come down from space and

910
00:54:36,181 --> 00:54:37,140
this is a problem.

911
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:41,640
This is a problem because the decisions
need to be made on a more realistic

912
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:45,750
human level, which is like, hey, there's a
lot of people on this fucking planet. We,

913
00:54:45,751 --> 00:54:49,610
um, we, uh, we, we need to
start working together and uh,

914
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:54,540
and stop blowing each other up
as crazy an idea is that may be,

915
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:58,860
it's pretty much time to put down the
Bible. Let's put down the fucking Koran.

916
00:54:59,070 --> 00:54:59,920
Let's put down the,

917
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:03,930
let's put down the old crusty old fucking
scrolls and just treat it like we're

918
00:55:03,931 --> 00:55:06,870
living in a neighborhood. And
let's see if we can fucking, um,

919
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:10,980
let's see if we can just stop blowing
each other up for a second. Iran,

920
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:15,570
you don't need nuclear
missiles. Iran, let's not make
nuclear missiles and Israel,

921
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:19,890
let's not fucking attack Iran right now.
No, none of the people want to fight.

922
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:23,610
None of the people want war. We don't
want to die. I don't want to die.

923
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:27,870
I don't want anybody to get fucking
blown up. None of us want that man. Well,

924
00:55:27,871 --> 00:55:31,560
maybe like,
maybe there's 3000 of us who want that.

925
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:34,500
Maybe there's 3000 people who
really are into it. And that's it.

926
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:38,580
And there's a lot more of us than there
are of them, you know. So at some point,

927
00:55:38,581 --> 00:55:43,050
something has to happen where a shift
takes place, where people start, uh,

928
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:48,260
prioritizing what's actually happening
over what people dressed in funny outfits

929
00:55:48,571 --> 00:55:51,690
are telling us. An invisible man
is saying, we should do, you know,

930
00:55:51,870 --> 00:55:54,600
it's like so obvious.
For example,

931
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:57,480
if like you're in the woods and you
get to choose between two guides,

932
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:02,120
there's a guy wearing
camouflage, he's like, got to
fucking go Rambo knife and uh,

933
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:04,320
uh,
some fucking awesome tattoos.

934
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:07,560
And then there's the guy who comes out
dressed in a black fucking cloak holding

935
00:56:07,561 --> 00:56:12,450
a book and he's like, this is a magic
book. This is my magic force book.

936
00:56:12,451 --> 00:56:16,530
And this book will give you all the
answers you need in this giant, massive,

937
00:56:16,531 --> 00:56:19,980
deadly dangerous snake filled
bear, written, forced. Do.

938
00:56:19,981 --> 00:56:24,630
Are you going to pick the guy with a magic
book or the fucking the, um, the, yeah,

939
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:27,460
we go with, okay, you go
with the Kmo fucking guy.

940
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,080
You go with the fucking Cammo guy.

941
00:56:29,081 --> 00:56:31,580
Maybe you take down the guy and the
funny robe and steal his rubbed,

942
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:35,190
make a Hammock, but you don't
fucking, you don't fuck it up.

943
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:36,970
You don't follow the
guy with a funny book.

944
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:41,470
Well unless your brain doesn't work
that good man, that's a problem.

945
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:46,390
I think that one of the
things that religion can do
for people that really helps

946
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:50,260
is it gives you an operating system and
I think intelligent people use it that

947
00:56:50,261 --> 00:56:55,261
way and I think some really dumb people
use it that way and if they didn't have

948
00:56:55,331 --> 00:56:59,050
it, they wouldn't know what to do
and they might actually be a problem.

949
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:03,100
I think it gives people an
operating system and all
though I don't agree with it.

950
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:08,550
I think it's like I've described it as
like religion being like scaffolding that

951
00:57:08,570 --> 00:57:11,620
it's like scaffolding for
expanding consciousness.

952
00:57:11,621 --> 00:57:15,430
It allows you to have like some real
solid shit that you don't have to think or

953
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:18,220
worry about. Yes. And then
concentrate on being positive,

954
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:23,200
helping your brother being, you know,
being a generous person. It's a vehicle,

955
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:27,130
a vehicle for. And if you know
you need stories or you know,

956
00:57:27,131 --> 00:57:30,850
scripture or whatever it is that you
need to get you into that frame of mind

957
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:33,460
that puts you on that good scaffolding,

958
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:36,050
this shit's encode it,
man. It's, it's a fractal.

959
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:40,790
There's deep information and all the
scriptures. I certainly, um, I, when I,

960
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:45,620
they are all so different and the rules
are so different, you know? That's true,

961
00:57:45,621 --> 00:57:49,190
man. I know some of them are
just not into being happy, right?

962
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:53,600
Well, no, no. Well, yeah, we'll see
what it is, is, it seems to be a,

963
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,990
a problem of literalism,
you know,

964
00:57:55,991 --> 00:58:00,991
it's like people are reading things
and taking them literally and so,

965
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:05,960
and not looking into the deeper levels
of things. This is happening, um, uh,

966
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:08,110
in every single aspect of our society,

967
00:58:08,111 --> 00:58:12,790
it seems that people are becoming more and
more literal. They, they, they, the, the,

968
00:58:12,791 --> 00:58:17,370
their understanding of symbolism parody,
that kind of stuff becomes a,

969
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:19,570
it seems to be a little muddied right now.
For example,

970
00:58:19,571 --> 00:58:23,530
the most recent thing that happened
is, uh, as you know, I know,

971
00:58:23,531 --> 00:58:27,400
you know Daniel Tosh and the fucking
rape fiasco for example, right? Yeah.

972
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:30,250
Now Daniel Tosh,

973
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:35,570
and I know this has been chewed gum on
this show, but just the third podcast,

974
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:40,780
oh, comedienne Chabay talking
about it. These bastards.
What a steal. I wired's the,

975
00:58:40,781 --> 00:58:43,810
the, um, the, uh, the, the, so
the, so someone, when you make,

976
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,770
when you deal with things on the
surface level and you don't look deeper,

977
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:49,480
well then you get into stupid wrestling,

978
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:54,280
semantic wrestling matches with comedians
over the most ridiculous ideas ever.

979
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:57,520
Instead of just like, yeah, he was
like throwing something out there.

980
00:58:57,670 --> 00:59:00,530
He's not a rapist. He
doesn't want to rape. Uh, he,

981
00:59:00,531 --> 00:59:04,160
he's just threw something out there.
It's no problem. You know, the Depo,

982
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:06,880
just a little, just three inches under
the surface of that fucking thing.

983
00:59:06,881 --> 00:59:11,110
And it's a yawn. It's a yawn, mostly
just like whatever. But like, um,

984
00:59:11,111 --> 00:59:14,920
on the surface it's fucking so important,
so very fucking serious.

985
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:19,330
So in the same way people take
these very powerful scriptures,

986
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:24,020
they interpret them on the on the level
and they start arguing about the fucking

987
00:59:24,021 --> 00:59:28,130
surface level. So now when people are
talking about the fucking garden of Eden,

988
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:32,000
they're arguing over like who?
Who was the bad guy?

989
00:59:32,430 --> 00:59:36,400
Was it eve or was it ad and well it was
Eve's fuck cause she listed that darn

990
00:59:36,401 --> 00:59:39,800
old snake first.
People really think that.

991
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:41,300
They're like yeah it's the woman's fault.

992
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:45,290
That's what she got cursed
with a painful child birth.

993
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:49,820
And there's some of that in there, but
it's like come on fuck heads, come on.

994
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,210
Like if you say so then when you look
at like when you get into the fucking

995
00:59:53,211 --> 00:59:57,350
Kabbalah and you look at the cobblistic
tree of life and you see something

996
00:59:57,351 --> 01:00:00,470
that's taking the fucking idea of the
tree of life in the garden of Eden and

997
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,510
deepening it to like that,

998
01:00:02,511 --> 01:00:07,040
it really much deeper part of the fucking
fractal where it's an expression of

999
01:00:07,041 --> 01:00:10,160
the expansion of nothingness
into something that's in
the universe and it's a

1000
01:00:10,161 --> 01:00:15,161
cool metaphysical grid that shows
the thing becoming aware of itself.

1001
01:00:15,290 --> 01:00:18,380
Or a thing waking up and then
becoming aware of itself,

1002
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:22,070
creating a triangle which flips over
because it reflects itself into the

1003
01:00:22,071 --> 01:00:26,150
universe and these are our, it's
deep. It's heavy shit and you can,

1004
01:00:26,270 --> 01:00:29,650
it's fucking awesome because this
Kabbalah, that's the good, the cobblistic

1005
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:32,360
tree of life and then assist the stuff
that you're not supposed to even read

1006
01:00:32,361 --> 01:00:36,140
until you hit like 36 or some shit like,
yeah, that's what they say. I mean,

1007
01:00:36,190 --> 01:00:38,090
I don't know. I don't go to the
Kabbalah Center or anything.

1008
01:00:38,091 --> 01:00:43,091
I just remember reading Alice to Crawley
and he's got like some fucking snake

1009
01:00:43,490 --> 01:00:47,780
sound to confirm your allegiance
with Satan. You're a grown man.

1010
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:53,370
Oh, let me tell you I,

1011
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:56,450
I've used it as son.
I found myself his name from time to time,

1012
01:00:56,540 --> 01:01:00,260
just for the fuck of it and hang out and
feel good. Hang over. You go hang over.

1013
01:01:00,261 --> 01:01:03,220
You feel like a vampire vampire
is look like right? They look at,

1014
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:07,850
they're hung over. Like when
the sun comes up, they do.

1015
01:01:07,851 --> 01:01:12,320
They look fucking what a weird idea is
that sometimes you can have vampires that

1016
01:01:12,321 --> 01:01:16,580
fall all the vampire rules. Until real
recently people got so fucking arrogant.

1017
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:17,930
They were like, well, no, no, no.

1018
01:01:17,931 --> 01:01:22,820
Now Vampires are actually your friend
and they only eat deer and they don't

1019
01:01:22,821 --> 01:01:25,910
burn. When it's sunny out.
They just glisten and they
don't want to be glistening.

1020
01:01:25,911 --> 01:01:29,120
They sparkle Joe. They
don't glisten. They sparkle.

1021
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:33,710
Just vampires all of a sudden became
cool and you could fuck them. Oh yeah.

1022
01:01:33,870 --> 01:01:37,700
Well that's Andrew Rice's fault.
Right? And rise or fall. Oh my God.

1023
01:01:37,701 --> 01:01:41,270
The fucking interview with a vampire.
I don't think so man.

1024
01:01:41,271 --> 01:01:45,350
Because even before interview with
the Vampire, Dracula was very sexual.

1025
01:01:45,490 --> 01:01:48,370
The Dracula was a hypnotic.
Yeah,

1026
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:52,750
he was a very sexual and like a
lot of the older movies, you know,

1027
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:56,750
there was a few of the Gary Oldman. What
came first? Gary Oldman or Anne Rice?

1028
01:01:56,810 --> 01:02:00,470
Probably in rise, right? I don't want
Gary Oldman Dracula. I think Anne Rice,

1029
01:02:00,471 --> 01:02:01,800
I'm always positive actually.
Well,

1030
01:02:01,810 --> 01:02:06,220
no, the fucking old Dracula, I think
the, the Brahms Stoker Dracula.

1031
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:10,660
Oh that was so long that some traps and
the castle didn't he have like there was

1032
01:02:10,661 --> 01:02:15,250
a room you went into and there are all
these female vampire is running hot.

1033
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:20,040
Is there a car? Yeah and like they were
seductive and would like, you know,

1034
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,450
they would know how riffle Dracula,

1035
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:24,000
that's the good part of that where
everyone is hating on Dracula.

1036
01:02:24,001 --> 01:02:25,890
It's got these hard pitches
that want to suck blood.

1037
01:02:26,070 --> 01:02:29,410
They're ready to throw it out.
It just gets the bone him.

1038
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,710
He never bound them in front of
you buddy though. It was just,

1039
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:34,790
I guess once you start drinking people's
blood that's like way cool with him.

1040
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:37,470
The one in checks just
completely give up on bowling.

1041
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:42,480
I mean in the world of vampires it's that
is boning the best track though of all

1042
01:02:42,481 --> 01:02:46,980
time. Unquestionably. It was Gary
Oldman. Did you see that one? I don't.

1043
01:02:46,990 --> 01:02:51,990
Bram stoker I got so it's so good
that Keanu Reeves can't fuck it up.

1044
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:54,870
I got it like I don't know
cause I haven't seen it,

1045
01:02:54,871 --> 01:02:58,110
but I'll tell you my favorite
fucking vampire by the way.
I do like Keanu Reeves.

1046
01:02:58,130 --> 01:03:01,260
It's just as cheap joke. I like
canneries. It's cheating. It's the Joe.

1047
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:04,200
I love you can, I love God. I love
you. Didn't pay attention to my joke.

1048
01:03:04,201 --> 01:03:05,560
He just went in and say,
what are you going to say?

1049
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:14,250
Here's where my mind started wandering
is you said the greatest vampire and then

1050
01:03:14,251 --> 01:03:18,150
I thought, no, no, no. The
greatest vampire of all time,

1051
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:23,460
the spookiest vampire of all time is
fucking Nosferatu. Oh, the original. Yeah,

1052
01:03:23,461 --> 01:03:28,380
you're right. Fuck that thing. We'll also,
that was like really original. I mean,

1053
01:03:28,381 --> 01:03:32,040
and think about that guy did that. It
was like, wow, this is a silent movie.

1054
01:03:32,790 --> 01:03:37,380
No Man, that thing was a
scary son of a bitch was like,

1055
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:41,200
that's what a vampires like the
long fingers kind of gobbling,

1056
01:03:42,270 --> 01:03:47,270
just as creepy thing pops out
of the shadows that talks.

1057
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:52,350
I do keep talking. I love it. Sorry
my, my yapping too much. Oh, I love it.

1058
01:03:52,410 --> 01:03:57,390
Oh you do? Really? Yeah, man. Yeah, man.
That guy's fucking scary. But you know,

1059
01:03:57,391 --> 01:04:02,391
the Salem's lot vampires
are pretty fucking spooky
to 1922 brother 1922 and I'm

1060
01:04:04,381 --> 01:04:08,250
looking at the images of it right now.
Oh my God. It's, it's fucking incredible.

1061
01:04:08,330 --> 01:04:11,940
It is legitimately frightening.
Legitimately frightening.

1062
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:16,950
And it was in the fucking early
19 hundreds, dude rentable.

1063
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:19,560
And they find fucking coffin stilted.
You know,

1064
01:04:19,561 --> 01:04:23,460
they found coffins out there where people
have hammered stakes into the Oh yeah.

1065
01:04:23,490 --> 01:04:24,211
Well there's probably,

1066
01:04:24,211 --> 01:04:26,880
I'm sure people that were fucking
assholes and they just wanted to make sure

1067
01:04:26,881 --> 01:04:31,620
that really never came back.
But this motherfucker was
creepy. You're right, man.

1068
01:04:31,890 --> 01:04:34,860
You know, he might be the
scariest one ever. Yes.

1069
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:38,550
Especially when you consider it was
90 fucking years ago. Yeah. Man,

1070
01:04:38,551 --> 01:04:41,130
that was fucking spit. Well, I mean,
that was based on the real thing.

1071
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:44,220
Whatever was wandering around out
in the fucking woods of Germany.

1072
01:04:44,221 --> 01:04:49,200
That's what was out there. What
a crazy people. Do you remember?

1073
01:04:49,201 --> 01:04:53,070
Uh, it was, uh, it was based
on a real man. The, Oh my God,

1074
01:04:53,071 --> 01:04:54,780
look this fucking photo of it,
dude.

1075
01:04:55,560 --> 01:05:00,480
It's a really good God damn image that
they're really fucking scary looking.

1076
01:05:00,510 --> 01:05:02,040
Yeah,
that's a scary vampire.

1077
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:06,810
1922 because if you go wash like King
Kong, King Kong is not really scary.

1078
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:10,790
And that's a little from like the 30s.
Nope, not scary at all. And that's scary.

1079
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:14,040
It can con can,
cannot fuck with Nosferatu.

1080
01:05:15,630 --> 01:05:18,970
No, not, I mean, I guess if I had
to pick who I wanted to run from,

1081
01:05:18,971 --> 01:05:21,730
it's going to be a fucking
Nosferatu though. But I weird.

1082
01:05:21,731 --> 01:05:24,160
Is it that they just hijacked
the whole vampire thing?

1083
01:05:24,161 --> 01:05:27,250
Vancouver is used to be the worst shit
that could ever happen to you and now

1084
01:05:27,251 --> 01:05:30,560
he's a hunky guy. Well, I'll tell
you why they fucking did that ship.

1085
01:05:30,570 --> 01:05:34,330
Rather we in it. Yeah. You got to
sell it to teenagers. It's women, men,

1086
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:39,420
lot of women Wa people that
want that want romance. The A,

1087
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:44,230
the thing about the twilight books,
so I've been told by Mrs Rogan, uh,

1088
01:05:44,290 --> 01:05:47,500
is that the very romantic,

1089
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:51,730
unrealistically romantic because he's a
vampire and it's like he's got all the

1090
01:05:51,731 --> 01:05:55,430
super power and everything like that.
It's like he, like he's giving it all up,

1091
01:05:55,431 --> 01:05:59,620
but just to be with her, you know what I
mean? And it's this weird sort of like,

1092
01:05:59,690 --> 01:06:03,490
he, he needs her so much
and women love that shit.

1093
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:06,250
It's just a natural sort
of a thing for though.

1094
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:09,490
So like when you see like women that
would be waiting in line to go to those

1095
01:06:09,491 --> 01:06:13,390
movies, that just, it just hits a
chord that we don't, we don't have,

1096
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:14,650
we don't know that court,

1097
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:18,310
but the who wrote that shit and I
was their cord so she nailed it.

1098
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:20,440
Love.

1099
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:25,440
I'm talking about the court
of affection and admiration.

1100
01:06:26,171 --> 01:06:30,490
Like I think all women want to be,
you know, they want to be worshiped,

1101
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:31,390
you know,

1102
01:06:31,390 --> 01:06:34,060
they think that that's like the most
romantic thing for a guy who would do

1103
01:06:34,061 --> 01:06:37,790
anything for you. So he would do
anything for that girl in, in,

1104
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:40,790
in those books he would do
anything for, I mean, he,

1105
01:06:40,791 --> 01:06:43,090
he didn't even want to bite
her. He wanted, uh, you know,

1106
01:06:43,091 --> 01:06:45,830
he wanted to protect her from everybody
who was in love with her. Meanwhile,

1107
01:06:45,970 --> 01:06:48,520
he was like a thousand years old
and she's in high school. Like,

1108
01:06:48,521 --> 01:06:50,920
it's really fucking creepy if
you stop and think about it.

1109
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:53,380
He's a thousand years old
or whatever the fuck it is.

1110
01:06:54,030 --> 01:06:56,530
I tell area she's in high school,
man.

1111
01:06:56,620 --> 01:07:00,160
You're fucking crazy kind of
conversations you're having with her.

1112
01:07:00,970 --> 01:07:04,480
Jesus Christ. I mean, it'd be
hard enough if you were 30,

1113
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:07,930
you were 30 and you're dating a
girl in high school, you'd be like,

1114
01:07:07,931 --> 01:07:10,960
I got to kill myself. I can't
take it. I can't talk to her.

1115
01:07:10,961 --> 01:07:12,520
She's fucking just shows.

1116
01:07:12,521 --> 01:07:15,970
All she wants to talk about
is Instagram thousand old.

1117
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:21,110
You fucking creeper. He's a total
creeper. She could be as Greg Greg.

1118
01:07:21,140 --> 01:07:25,330
It's not like he just was frozen for all
those years. Like captain America. No,

1119
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:29,680
this asshole's been alive the whole time
and uh, pretended he's in high school.

1120
01:07:29,890 --> 01:07:34,480
It might be one of the dumbest ideas ever.
It's not fair. He's got magical powers.

1121
01:07:34,481 --> 01:07:38,620
He can fly. He's flying a
fucking high school kid through
the trees. Jesus Christ.

1122
01:07:38,710 --> 01:07:41,730
Did they fuck yes. Eventually. Yeah.

1123
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:46,570
Later in the boiler spoiler.
Yes. Allegedly. How about that?

1124
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:48,580
I don't know. It was, it already
happened. It might have already happened.

1125
01:07:48,610 --> 01:07:51,160
I only saw like two of them.
I think there's been three of them.

1126
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:54,760
Put it in her asshole.
I don't think vampires a lot to do that.

1127
01:07:55,850 --> 01:08:00,700
It's a sin. Even for Vampires.
I think we've vampires. No,

1128
01:08:01,150 --> 01:08:05,730
no, no female that go cut the shirt.

1129
01:08:06,310 --> 01:08:10,690
Just stop it. They don't even shit
anymore, so probably drives up nice,

1130
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:18,260
don't shit. When you're eating blood,
they probably barely a urinal dude.

1131
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:20,810
You probably get the exact amount
you need. You don't know that.

1132
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:23,960
I would imagine you would get to the exact
amount you need now, man of vampires.

1133
01:08:23,980 --> 01:08:26,090
Asshole is swollen.

1134
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:30,980
Broken a scene where you walk down into
a New York City subway and you saw some

1135
01:08:30,981 --> 01:08:34,100
crazy looking vampire dude,
you're shitting blood.

1136
01:08:35,540 --> 01:08:37,760
Just blood squirting out of his ass.

1137
01:08:38,510 --> 01:08:40,550
Chunky cottage cheese blood.

1138
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:46,190
That's what a vampire he looks
like a tunnel, a subway title,

1139
01:08:46,191 --> 01:08:47,030
just shitting blood,

1140
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:51,410
looking at you and thinking
about sucking your blood next.

1141
01:08:51,530 --> 01:08:54,860
It's weird that they're like, that's that.
That's as far as they go. Like vampires,

1142
01:08:54,861 --> 01:08:56,330
suck your blood.
That's the worst thing I do.

1143
01:08:56,331 --> 01:08:59,540
But there's never been like a supernatural
creature that walked that like mouth

1144
01:08:59,541 --> 01:09:03,480
fucks you. You know what I mean? Some
we talked about that before. You know,

1145
01:09:03,490 --> 01:09:07,700
he really, as ridiculous as it is, I think
we actually did talk about this before.

1146
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:09,670
It must be on my fucking mind,
man.

1147
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:13,730
There's no fucking bat or
some creepy for rapes people.

1148
01:09:13,731 --> 01:09:16,160
That was mouth rape and dudes.
I don't use that word.

1149
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:21,460
A fucking horrifying, horrifying
being. It doesn't have to be a vampire.

1150
01:09:21,470 --> 01:09:22,850
It could just be some bug,

1151
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:26,750
some insect or something that came out
of the earth and that's how it does it.

1152
01:09:26,751 --> 01:09:30,020
It just fucking,
it leaves off of the,

1153
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:33,410
it lives off of like people gagging.

1154
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:37,560
That's it absorbs the energy of gagging.

1155
01:09:37,570 --> 01:09:38,960
It gets power for the trip.

1156
01:09:38,990 --> 01:09:42,110
The twitching of your body when
you're trying to throw up, it's a gag.

1157
01:09:42,111 --> 01:09:46,670
Pyre pipe is clogged by a fat
cock and you can't even throw up.

1158
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:50,460
You're trying to throw up and he's just
holding the back of your head was Scaly

1159
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:55,400
Paul. That's what they came to
do. They just came to get head.

1160
01:09:55,610 --> 01:10:00,560
They have like really tough dicks, like
you really cannot even pierce the skin.

1161
01:10:00,770 --> 01:10:02,240
You can bite it as hard as you want.

1162
01:10:02,241 --> 01:10:06,590
It doesn't matter when alien's face fuck
you. They just did. It just goes in.

1163
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:10,640
You accept it and it, it just fucks
your throat when you try and throw up.

1164
01:10:10,730 --> 01:10:14,630
But he can't get past the fat alien
cock that's stretching your insides out,

1165
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:17,930
pumping oxygen. And by the way,
it's keeping you alive in your life.

1166
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:23,570
It changes your whole,

1167
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:27,510
it blows your lungs out and
actually eats them and uh,

1168
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:32,690
converts it to a type of glue that keeps
the cock attached to your body to keep

1169
01:10:32,961 --> 01:10:35,180
you alive.
Cause now you no longer have lungs.

1170
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:38,700
You get all your oxygen through his cock.

1171
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:47,300
Oh my God. Could you imagine? That would
be the word. And some people would say,

1172
01:10:47,301 --> 01:10:50,870
you know what? I don't
care. I love aliens anyway.

1173
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:54,500
There's still all Sarah teaching us.
Listen,

1174
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:56,420
if for him might be really awesome.

1175
01:10:57,070 --> 01:11:00,140
Maybe he loves the fact that he's
getting the oxygen to that cock.

1176
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:03,380
You stay alive, your body where
there's a way I can't really move.

1177
01:11:03,381 --> 01:11:05,140
Your arms are flailing and like in paled,

1178
01:11:05,170 --> 01:11:10,170
you just look like a skeleton with a
fucking Gildo in its mouth and every year

1179
01:11:10,491 --> 01:11:13,710
it just goes deeper in your body,
keeps debt growing.

1180
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:16,170
Eventually it turns into the
age is turning it like a Cactus,

1181
01:11:16,171 --> 01:11:20,370
like cactus Dick thing. Yeah. If
you look at sugar, Barb shish Kebab,

1182
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:23,220
Dick Kebab, every year the, the,

1183
01:11:23,221 --> 01:11:28,050
the s the dick slowly grows inside your
body and starts cracking open Oregon's

1184
01:11:28,051 --> 01:11:29,970
and pushing ribs to the side,

1185
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:34,230
popping them and snapping them as it
eventually goes through your body.

1186
01:11:34,230 --> 01:11:37,770
But it does it so slowly that you never
actually die, especially since the, uh,

1187
01:11:37,771 --> 01:11:41,610
the deck is providing with oxygen, but
then when it gets to the head, to the end,

1188
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:45,350
the deck pops out of your asshole and
you deflate like a balloon. And that,

1189
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:48,540
and that sound is that
sound is known as fumbling.

1190
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:53,040
Like it's like the sound of a man's final.
Fom there's no words sound. It's like a

1191
01:11:57,570 --> 01:12:00,900
cute, I mean, that's not any weirder
than a lot of shit that's real.

1192
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:04,170
It's not any weirder than those aquatic
worms that just stayed inside of

1193
01:12:04,190 --> 01:12:07,680
grasshoppers and committing, get them
to commit suicide so they can be born.

1194
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:10,800
That's an and that's enough.
No, man, this is this. I know.

1195
01:12:10,801 --> 01:12:13,770
It's not that fucking weird and not weird
at all. Right? But it's like we don't,

1196
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:17,700
the closest to harder movement course.
It's weird, but it's the weirdest thing.

1197
01:12:17,701 --> 01:12:21,840
But it's not any more weird than like
cordyceps mushrooms that grow inside ants

1198
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:26,850
heads and then explode and spray the
air and affect all these other ants to

1199
01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:27,693
become zombies.

1200
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:32,650
Fucking Nah, I god Damn my bane. Ling's
God bless you. Starcraft two our is,

1201
01:12:32,670 --> 01:12:36,210
I love you. Um, it turns, it
turns him into bombs, right?

1202
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:41,130
It turns into fucking, uh, bombs.
That's a fungal bomb. Yeah,

1203
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:46,140
it's crazy. Um, uh, yeah dude,
fucking the, the nature is insane man.

1204
01:12:46,141 --> 01:12:51,141
And like I sometimes I think about that
notion of the fungal consciousness and

1205
01:12:51,781 --> 01:12:56,370
factor, the thing that like, uh, you know,
the, I know, we know this is chewed gum,

1206
01:12:56,371 --> 01:12:59,790
cause I know we've talked about
toxoplasmosis for example.

1207
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:03,720
I had to describe that today to Everlast.
I'd explained to him about cats.

1208
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:07,080
But Dude, if you take this
the next level, you know,

1209
01:13:07,110 --> 01:13:10,660
this is where we get into the realm,
the metaphysical realm that, um,

1210
01:13:11,070 --> 01:13:15,480
a lot of people believe that, you know,
you can get fucking possessed by a spirit,

1211
01:13:15,590 --> 01:13:18,120
right? And this is not just fucking
Christians. This is like an,

1212
01:13:18,121 --> 01:13:21,080
almost every religion
has this notion that uh,

1213
01:13:21,550 --> 01:13:25,680
I think you can get into you and start
fucking controlling you. And it's like,

1214
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:29,700
man, if it's, if there's fuck, you know,

1215
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:34,950
maybe there's this embodied beings
that really can like get inside you,

1216
01:13:35,310 --> 01:13:40,080
you know, maybe, maybe just certain ideas.
Is it maybe like certain ideas? I think,

1217
01:13:40,470 --> 01:13:41,880
um,
what's his name?

1218
01:13:41,881 --> 01:13:45,360
Stein or someone was just telling me he
believed the ideas were alive. Right?

1219
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:46,950
And so,
ah,

1220
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:50,760
what if there are certain ideas that
someone can implant into your head?

1221
01:13:51,210 --> 01:13:54,690
That's the exact same thing as being
possessed. You know what I mean?

1222
01:13:54,691 --> 01:13:57,630
So you get this fucking idea
and it just grows inside of you.

1223
01:13:57,930 --> 01:14:00,030
Much like our legendary Dick Alien.

1224
01:14:00,031 --> 01:14:04,480
It grows inside of you and turns you
into a fucking different person. Yeah.

1225
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:05,121
Is it hard?

1226
01:14:05,121 --> 01:14:08,930
There are certain people that are so
susceptible to ideas and words that they

1227
01:14:08,931 --> 01:14:12,010
can get them in their head and
obsess on them. The point of almost

1228
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:14,980
like madness. Yes. I
had a friend who had a,

1229
01:14:14,981 --> 01:14:19,840
a nervous breakdown while he was
hosting a show where there was a,

1230
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:23,650
a a black gentleman who was the
actor in the show, very famous guy.

1231
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:27,610
And as he's, um, he's warming up
the crown Brody Stevens style,

1232
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:32,500
he gets this thought in his head that he
can't get out and the thought is don't

1233
01:14:32,501 --> 01:14:36,830
say nigger, don't say, Nigga, whatever
you do, don't say that he could,

1234
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:40,210
he would never say it. He's not a racist
by any stretch of the imagination.

1235
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:42,200
It was just madness.
Yeah.

1236
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:46,900
So we had a complete nervous
breakdown while he was doing stand up,

1237
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:51,700
while he was warming up on some Hollywood
sound stage and he just had a nervous

1238
01:14:51,701 --> 01:14:55,780
breakdown. He just, he couldn't
not think of not saying that word,

1239
01:14:55,930 --> 01:14:59,710
so it would just completely
fucking freaked them out
to the point where he froze

1240
01:14:59,830 --> 01:15:02,470
and he couldn't get any words on.
People were concerned about him.

1241
01:15:02,650 --> 01:15:04,300
They were looking at him like,
is he okay?

1242
01:15:04,330 --> 01:15:07,480
Like he just stopped in mid sentence
and everyone's listening to him.

1243
01:15:07,481 --> 01:15:12,310
He's got a microphone. He just locked
the fuck up with. And I was like, wow.

1244
01:15:12,870 --> 01:15:14,410
Oh. It was like, what is that like

1245
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:16,340
possessed by an idea.

1246
01:15:16,490 --> 01:15:20,030
The idea possessed them and took over
his body and there's other versions of

1247
01:15:20,031 --> 01:15:20,900
this idea,
you know,

1248
01:15:20,901 --> 01:15:23,570
whatever the fucking idea is that gets
in someone's head and makes them think

1249
01:15:23,571 --> 01:15:27,140
that a solution to a problem is the
wrap explosives around their body and go

1250
01:15:27,141 --> 01:15:30,980
wandering into a fucking cafe.
That person's got a bad idea.

1251
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:35,270
That's a bad idea inside their
head. That's a bad thing.
Living inside their head.

1252
01:15:35,290 --> 01:15:37,280
Yeah, it's a bad idea. And it's like,

1253
01:15:37,281 --> 01:15:38,810
there's a lot of fucking
people on the planet.

1254
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:42,030
You've got some bad ideas and their
fucking heads, man. Yeah. You know,

1255
01:15:42,470 --> 01:15:45,800
but you know, they're just, I suppose
whether they're living or not,

1256
01:15:45,801 --> 01:15:50,300
it's just a device to like help
understand the spread of the thing.

1257
01:15:50,301 --> 01:15:52,490
And this spreads more like a virus.

1258
01:15:52,491 --> 01:15:55,610
Ideas spread more like a virus
than they do anything else. Right.

1259
01:15:55,611 --> 01:16:00,110
They fucking take over a person.
They get into its subjective DNA.

1260
01:16:00,470 --> 01:16:05,000
They transform its thought patterns and
then not being begins to infect those

1261
01:16:05,001 --> 01:16:07,640
around it with the similar ideas.

1262
01:16:07,641 --> 01:16:11,420
And then that spreads the fucking thought
disease out through it through the

1263
01:16:11,421 --> 01:16:16,280
world. Do you know? Right. And that
that's like going on right fucking now.

1264
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:17,070
Right.

1265
01:16:17,070 --> 01:16:22,070
God Damn Chick-Filet I'm going to go
around at chick filet and eat some fucking

1266
01:16:22,910 --> 01:16:27,200
chicken sandwiches to show my love for
Jesus. Yeah. Right. You know, and, and,

1267
01:16:27,201 --> 01:16:28,790
and like that's a Vr,
you know, that's the,

1268
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:32,390
a flower growing from the tree of an
idea that's been planted in the minds of

1269
01:16:32,391 --> 01:16:36,860
many people. Um, you know, the
fundamentalists and it's like, fuck man,

1270
01:16:36,861 --> 01:16:38,030
what if it is a living thing?

1271
01:16:38,031 --> 01:16:43,031
What if they're actually possessed by
a living force that is not that great?

1272
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:46,310
It's just like that fungal things in,
in the answer the tree.

1273
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:48,110
That's interesting.

1274
01:16:48,110 --> 01:16:51,050
That's an interesting way of looking at
it that these ideas are actually living

1275
01:16:51,051 --> 01:16:55,910
things. Yeah. I mean it, it
might be, who knows? I mean it's,

1276
01:16:56,240 --> 01:17:00,830
it is very strange when you think about
the direction that our society goes and,

1277
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:06,040
and then it does seem to be led to and
fro by like really saying shit upon

1278
01:17:06,050 --> 01:17:09,980
occasion and Saint Saint Saint Shit.
And you're like, wait a minute,

1279
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:14,810
what are you doing? Because she did what
she danced. What, what? This is your,

1280
01:17:15,050 --> 01:17:17,520
this is your belief. You
know, you get a line,

1281
01:17:17,521 --> 01:17:20,480
a woman up in the middle of the street
and throw rocks at her because someone

1282
01:17:20,481 --> 01:17:25,100
caught her dating a member of the wrong
Muslim tribe. Yes. Oh my goodness.

1283
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:28,760
It gets, it gets weird man.
Really scary. Weird. Well,

1284
01:17:28,761 --> 01:17:31,940
it gets fucking weird because I mean
goddamn the first fucking when, when,

1285
01:17:31,970 --> 01:17:35,270
when the first monkey decided to come
down out of the tree and wander out and

1286
01:17:35,271 --> 01:17:38,770
start fucking hunting, you know,
I don't know. I don't know. But I,

1287
01:17:38,771 --> 01:17:41,630
I'm pretty sure that the other fucking
monkeys that decided to stay in the

1288
01:17:41,631 --> 01:17:43,730
fucking tree and in this situation,

1289
01:17:43,731 --> 01:17:46,460
I'm not saying one group is a monkey
and one group's not. I'm saying we're,

1290
01:17:46,470 --> 01:17:47,480
I'll fucking monkeys.

1291
01:17:47,780 --> 01:17:51,350
But the ones that decided to stay up
in the Goddamn tree didn't have nuclear

1292
01:17:51,351 --> 01:17:53,420
weapons.
You know

1293
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:02,150
that's about the nuclear sub that was
sneaking around off the coast of Mexico.

1294
01:18:02,370 --> 01:18:05,790
Shared Ed right down near San
Diego. Russian, right? Yeah.

1295
01:18:05,950 --> 01:18:10,090
Having a little fun Russian nuclear sub
gut right up next to us. Just a slight,

1296
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:14,990
you know, bitch, Holla and sneak
up on you. Armed with warheads.

1297
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:19,100
Sure. Easy. It was a real
legitimate nuclear submarine.
Check it out. What the fuck?

1298
01:18:19,610 --> 01:18:22,700
That wasn't a message. Oh my dear.
I guess they're there for awhile.

1299
01:18:22,730 --> 01:18:25,340
We didn't know they were there.
I guess my gps was off.

1300
01:18:25,341 --> 01:18:29,700
I ended up off the coast of San Diego.
Most of the symmetrical,

1301
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:34,020
most of the bullies
are onstar malfunction.

1302
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:39,380
Malfunction gps. Yeah. How crazy is that?

1303
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:43,430
There was a war ship. The other superpower
that wants to get bigger and better.

1304
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:48,020
What's he? He's run by criminals.
Here's where we come to the fucking,

1305
01:18:48,410 --> 01:18:53,150
you know the, the, the, the thing
that mechanic kept talking about,

1306
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:57,620
he's like, look, we don't have time
to teach people and meditate anymore.

1307
01:18:57,620 --> 01:19:01,100
People are possessed by this fucking idea.

1308
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:02,930
We can teach people to meditate,

1309
01:19:02,931 --> 01:19:07,160
but first they need to get
super high on a psychedelic.

1310
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:09,320
You know what I mean?
Like there needs to be this,

1311
01:19:09,321 --> 01:19:13,910
there's like this imperative to
transform those fucking crazy thoughts,

1312
01:19:13,911 --> 01:19:17,300
structures that are floating
around in people's heads, um,

1313
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:21,230
because they've got fucking
nuclear weapons. Thanks Fran.

1314
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:24,890
You can't just climb out of the
Goddamn tree. Now, you know,

1315
01:19:24,891 --> 01:19:26,020
if you climb out of the fucking treat,

1316
01:19:26,021 --> 01:19:29,390
people are going to say you're a
goddamn heretic. You know, they're your,

1317
01:19:29,391 --> 01:19:31,120
you're a Goddamn anti American heritage.

1318
01:19:31,130 --> 01:19:33,980
Listen to me say there's no fucking
Jesus Christ and the God damn rabbits got

1319
01:19:33,981 --> 01:19:37,550
across the fucking ocean in some way
that didn't involve floating on logs.

1320
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:39,680
You're obsessed with this rabbit
and the ocean thing. Well,

1321
01:19:39,681 --> 01:19:42,290
they didn't say rabbits, but I just
picture that I just said animals.

1322
01:19:42,291 --> 01:19:44,720
I don't know. I don't know that spread
of rabbit throughout the planet.

1323
01:19:44,721 --> 01:19:48,770
I'm not floating around on logs.
Oh yeah. But some of those four,

1324
01:19:48,771 --> 01:19:52,160
you know what else is apparently
everywhere on the planet? Sasquatch.

1325
01:19:54,170 --> 01:19:58,360
Yeah. Well, yeah, you fucking laugh,
dude. But I'm going to squash.

1326
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:03,400
You're getting known as a a Sasquatch
believer that's happening to you.

1327
01:20:04,290 --> 01:20:08,130
I'm down,
I'm steady squatch and look man,

1328
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:11,890
if you ever watched the show finding
bigfoot? No, I just got a TV.

1329
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:15,580
I had bobo from finding big foot on the
podcast was awesome. He gave me a, uh,

1330
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:20,160
a cast is a cast over there. I'll
show it to ya. Foot giant foot hat.

1331
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:23,070
Does he believe it? Oh fuck yeah. He
believes it. He said he's seen it.

1332
01:20:24,890 --> 01:20:27,330
He said he's seen it, man. You know,
it's really creepy though. Really?

1333
01:20:27,660 --> 01:20:30,900
Northern California, that whole
area, it's called like Ape Canyon,

1334
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:33,450
Ape River Monkey Canyon.

1335
01:20:33,490 --> 01:20:37,020
It's like all these like weird
fucking names and involve primates,

1336
01:20:37,350 --> 01:20:40,080
but it's not a place where there's
any apes. It's really strange.

1337
01:20:40,650 --> 01:20:42,960
There's a lot of sightings in one area,

1338
01:20:43,050 --> 01:20:46,290
a lot of sightings for the last couple
of hundred years and it's a really

1339
01:20:46,291 --> 01:20:47,370
densely wooded area.

1340
01:20:47,550 --> 01:20:49,950
It doesn't mean that they're not
bears and people aren't on mushrooms.

1341
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:54,420
It's totally possible that it also could
have been just an idea that one person

1342
01:20:54,421 --> 01:20:59,250
had and they ran with it and it fucking
carried on as almost a tradition.

1343
01:20:59,610 --> 01:21:01,980
Okay.
Not to take this idea too far,

1344
01:21:02,330 --> 01:21:05,940
but fucking mechanic talked about
the idea that the Ufo is some kind of

1345
01:21:05,941 --> 01:21:09,900
projection of the Mystere
of the mystery of novelty,

1346
01:21:09,901 --> 01:21:14,450
of the something within humans or
something in fucking hyperspace.

1347
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:17,160
I think that was young.
Yeah. Carl Young. Carl Young,

1348
01:21:17,161 --> 01:21:21,870
maybe Makino has quoting young. Yeah.
It's um, aliens and Ufos and archetypes.

1349
01:21:22,110 --> 01:21:26,790
I forgot I forgot the book, but he wrote
a whole book on that concept that the,

1350
01:21:26,791 --> 01:21:29,750
uh,
the Ufo was almost like a,

1351
01:21:29,950 --> 01:21:32,430
a ghost of our imagination.

1352
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:34,800
So maybe this is probably a
terrible way of describing it.

1353
01:21:36,030 --> 01:21:38,280
Maybe this is a ghost of our imagination.

1354
01:21:38,281 --> 01:21:41,730
It's a kind of specter that rises up
out of the deepest parts of ourselves or

1355
01:21:41,731 --> 01:21:46,090
our potential and manifest is like,
this is what we could be, or this is me.

1356
01:21:46,110 --> 01:21:50,910
Have you ever seen a real UFO footage or
real photo that you were like, yes, I'm,

1357
01:21:50,911 --> 01:21:53,430
I'm, I, I have seen pictures,

1358
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:57,540
but every single picture
is always fucked up.

1359
01:21:57,930 --> 01:22:01,020
They had a new Saas coach picture
and all they got is his back.

1360
01:22:01,290 --> 01:22:05,880
Crystal clear and focus is bad.
Yeah.

1361
01:22:05,910 --> 01:22:09,630
One shot man, you sons
of bitches. All right.

1362
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:13,320
But it's not saying that there's not a
real animal and the reason why I say that

1363
01:22:13,321 --> 01:22:16,770
as Jane Goodall, Jane Goodall,
so she was 100% convinced.

1364
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:20,220
All the people should talk to that at
the same story and all the same side of

1365
01:22:20,221 --> 01:22:22,620
things. If there was an undiscovered
primate in the Pacific northwest,

1366
01:22:22,650 --> 01:22:26,460
I have no problem. I mean, it's never,
it's not anything that fucking wood.

1367
01:22:26,550 --> 01:22:30,360
I think it'd be really awesome if
somebody finally like caught one of those

1368
01:22:30,361 --> 01:22:31,620
things, but it wouldn't, like,

1369
01:22:31,690 --> 01:22:34,980
it's not going to make me fucking any
happier when I wake up in the balloon

1370
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:39,540
would make me happier. I love it. I'm
like a little kid. I'd be so happy,

1371
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:42,630
but I think what the fuck
do I know about primates?

1372
01:22:43,050 --> 01:22:46,020
A lot of what I know about primates came,
they learned from Jane Goodall.

1373
01:22:46,050 --> 01:22:50,400
So for me to like pretend that I know
more about primaries and Jane Goodall just

1374
01:22:50,401 --> 01:22:51,234
seems ridiculous.

1375
01:22:51,330 --> 01:22:55,710
So Jane Goodall says there's a climbed
without doing too much research,

1376
01:22:55,740 --> 01:22:59,340
I'm inclined to believe it. You
know, I mean Jane Goodall is,

1377
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:02,390
she's a bad ass bad ass lady.

1378
01:23:02,450 --> 01:23:06,590
The lady scholarly lady.
Thank you. But she's um,

1379
01:23:06,670 --> 01:23:10,520
may I ask you a question
for show me good off. Sean.

1380
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:14,620
You think she ever humped
one of those for sure. Yeah.

1381
01:23:14,630 --> 01:23:17,320
Fuck the shit out of at least one.
Just to see what was up.

1382
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:19,480
Maybe that's what kept
her all those years.

1383
01:23:19,660 --> 01:23:22,300
I think a lot of those ladies
that they want it, fucking chimps.

1384
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:26,530
Chimps have big dicks. You know,
it has that big Dicks, gorillas,

1385
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:28,150
gorilla girls,
a little tiny decks.

1386
01:23:28,151 --> 01:23:30,970
You know why no one is trying to fuck
their girls. Look at the size of them.

1387
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:34,570
Jesus Christ, the gorillas,
the back's the smart ones.

1388
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:37,210
You think about what they are.
They're these giant,

1389
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:41,470
enormous but peaceful vegetarian gorillas.

1390
01:23:41,710 --> 01:23:43,660
It's like nature just made them so big.

1391
01:23:43,661 --> 01:23:48,250
So you leave them the fuck alone and
it works so good that they can have a

1392
01:23:48,251 --> 01:23:51,100
Harem. So they have a heroin.
There's no need to grow a big deck.

1393
01:23:51,101 --> 01:23:54,220
He's not about the size of your Dick.
You don't have to impress these chicks.

1394
01:23:54,221 --> 01:23:55,510
They're yours.
Go ahead and get that one.

1395
01:23:55,660 --> 01:23:57,730
So they have like these little tiny dicks.
I'm like an inch long.

1396
01:23:57,910 --> 01:24:02,380
They're always fallen out. The grill
is a terrible fucking Christopher Ryan,

1397
01:24:02,740 --> 01:24:06,310
the author of sex at dawn talks about
this. He was telling me about this.

1398
01:24:06,311 --> 01:24:06,760
I really,

1399
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:11,530
how gorillas have a fucking tiny
little dicks because they have a hair.

1400
01:24:11,531 --> 01:24:15,430
Yeah, it's exact. There's no like
competition to grow like big cocks.

1401
01:24:15,431 --> 01:24:18,520
It's one thing else. All chimps have
huge balls too. It's all chimps.

1402
01:24:18,940 --> 01:24:22,720
Chimps have sluts, female chimps
just taking dick all over the place.

1403
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:27,280
So the mail chimps, their ball
swell disproportionately with sperm,

1404
01:24:27,490 --> 01:24:31,330
depending upon how much, uh,
promiscuity is in their clan.

1405
01:24:31,630 --> 01:24:32,590
So if everybody's fucking,

1406
01:24:32,591 --> 01:24:36,520
everybody that balls are giant and they're
just ready to shoot loads on a drop

1407
01:24:36,521 --> 01:24:37,120
of a hat.

1408
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:39,700
You got to be ready to fuck one of these
crazy bitches whenever we can hold them

1409
01:24:39,701 --> 01:24:43,510
down, that is banging each other left
and right. Especially like Benobos.

1410
01:24:44,740 --> 01:24:49,120
They're the craziest animal ever. They
have sex to, to uh, get over arguments.

1411
01:24:49,310 --> 01:24:52,800
They like men and men that
this is the women and women.

1412
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:54,730
One of the premises in this book,

1413
01:24:54,731 --> 01:24:57,490
which is the Banabos are
closer to us than champs,

1414
01:24:57,740 --> 01:25:02,350
are equally distant and you can ask
them genetically. So it's like, and,

1415
01:25:02,420 --> 01:25:04,840
and they fuck missionary position.

1416
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:07,170
They look in each other's eyes
when they're humping. Yeah.

1417
01:25:07,510 --> 01:25:11,300
I think there's some odd lesbians shit
that happens out there and there and just

1418
01:25:11,310 --> 01:25:14,740
sexually promiscuous.
They, yeah, it's a social,

1419
01:25:14,741 --> 01:25:18,070
it's a way to solidify
social bonds through humping.

1420
01:25:18,100 --> 01:25:21,880
They do everything except the mother
does it. Fuck the sun. That's it.

1421
01:25:21,940 --> 01:25:23,800
That's where they draw the line.
But other than that,

1422
01:25:23,801 --> 01:25:28,240
that's how they resolve issues. Father
Fox, daughter, father fucks daughter,

1423
01:25:28,740 --> 01:25:31,800
uh, brothers fuck sisters. Oh,

1424
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:36,640
but the mom does not fuck the
sons. Nope. Yeah, it's strange.

1425
01:25:36,670 --> 01:25:41,110
Or they got something right.
That's step one, bitches.

1426
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:42,520
Next try shoes

1427
01:25:44,350 --> 01:25:46,930
that never going to evolve because they
have the fucking thumbs on their feet

1428
01:25:46,931 --> 01:25:49,300
and they want to fly around the trees.
They're not going to lose that.

1429
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:51,400
Why would you lose that?
That's the most awesome thing ever.

1430
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:54,190
Flying around in the trees is way better
than any cool shit that we can do on

1431
01:25:54,191 --> 01:25:57,790
the ground, you know? So for them to like
develop cars and all that other shit,

1432
01:25:57,791 --> 01:25:59,920
you gonna have to spend a lot of time
just walking around with shoes on.

1433
01:26:00,250 --> 01:26:03,740
Well no man, this is where we get
into the IBM. First of all, man,

1434
01:26:03,770 --> 01:26:06,980
I love the fucking idea. A monkey
starting to wear shoes that would,

1435
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:11,000
that would make me wake up happy
to start off with catcher's Mitts.

1436
01:26:11,270 --> 01:26:14,270
How cute would that be?
Like you see film of like monkeys,

1437
01:26:14,271 --> 01:26:17,830
like in the cute little sandals that
they've made at a Bush baby who can't.

1438
01:26:17,850 --> 01:26:21,260
Do you think it would work? I
wonder if it would work. Sure.

1439
01:26:21,860 --> 01:26:24,800
I wonder if I could wear a men walk
around all catcher's Mitts on. Sure.

1440
01:26:24,801 --> 01:26:29,170
They could wear anything he could
wear. Fucking does tee shirts, helmets.

1441
01:26:29,180 --> 01:26:33,020
And God damn boxing gloves,
it'd be the best. What would,

1442
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:36,710
what do you think we would do if we walked
in and chimps in the jungle and they

1443
01:26:36,711 --> 01:26:39,720
were making shoes and we're
tying their shoes on? No, no,

1444
01:26:39,730 --> 01:26:42,710
not even weapons to shoes.
We'd we shoot them. No,

1445
01:26:42,770 --> 01:26:46,490
we'd weep with joy because it would
be the cutest thing anyone ever saw.

1446
01:26:46,491 --> 01:26:50,020
And also you'd be on the front
page of Reddit. Like yes,

1447
01:26:50,150 --> 01:26:53,180
it would be totally on the front
page or when it would explode.

1448
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:57,920
And also it'd be like, you
know, it'd be kind of like, um,

1449
01:26:58,310 --> 01:27:01,060
uh, really spooky thing. Like,

1450
01:27:01,070 --> 01:27:06,070
which is this idea that maybe evolution
itself is accelerating and all beings,

1451
01:27:07,761 --> 01:27:10,660
not just in fucking technol technology,
but like,

1452
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,830
it's like hitting everything.

1453
01:27:12,830 --> 01:27:16,370
It's starting to speed up everywhere
where those gorillas popping those fucking

1454
01:27:16,371 --> 01:27:18,500
poacher traps.
You know what I mean?

1455
01:27:18,501 --> 01:27:22,310
Like maybe shit's happening everywhere
is speeding up and speeding up and all

1456
01:27:22,311 --> 01:27:25,490
think where things are suddenly
going to just start like talking,

1457
01:27:25,670 --> 01:27:29,240
wearing fucking shoes,
talking and cute English accents.

1458
01:27:29,390 --> 01:27:32,540
For people who don't know, the girls
are figured out a way to disarm traps.

1459
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:35,190
They know, they figured out
the mechanism behind the trap.

1460
01:27:35,191 --> 01:27:39,470
So that triggered the trout to working
together. It's really fascinating.

1461
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:43,730
Really fascinating. They figured out a
way to communicate their idea and they uh,

1462
01:27:43,731 --> 01:27:46,580
they took out some traps.
Yeah. I mean, what would we do?

1463
01:27:46,610 --> 01:27:48,620
What would we do if they started evolving?
What would they do with,

1464
01:27:48,621 --> 01:27:51,680
they started developing weapons, you
know, if you came into the jungle,

1465
01:27:51,830 --> 01:27:55,490
then you found chimps and they were
holding on to spears with Flint tips.

1466
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:59,030
What the fuck do you do? You know,
what do you do that gets crazy?

1467
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:00,470
And what if they're just using it to hunt?

1468
01:28:00,710 --> 01:28:04,630
They just use it at the hunt within
one day. One tells a dog, you know,

1469
01:28:04,670 --> 01:28:07,940
steals a dog in Africa or somewhere
and the next thing you know,

1470
01:28:07,941 --> 01:28:11,720
it's on the war. Could you imagine
if they actually did evolve?

1471
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:15,950
What if chimpanzees, this is a
fucking stupid idea, strap in,

1472
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:20,120
but if you listen to Mckenna's idea,

1473
01:28:20,390 --> 01:28:24,530
Mckenna's idea of the stoned ape theory
was that there was a period of human

1474
01:28:24,531 --> 01:28:27,290
history that scientists are a
little bit confused about it.

1475
01:28:27,310 --> 01:28:30,230
And that period is over 2 million years.

1476
01:28:30,530 --> 01:28:34,070
The human brain doubled and they don't
know why. They really don't know.

1477
01:28:34,220 --> 01:28:37,190
There's all sorts of thoughts, you
know, like the throwing arm like that.

1478
01:28:37,191 --> 01:28:41,240
We figured out how throw shit and kill
things that accelerated our use of tools

1479
01:28:41,241 --> 01:28:45,170
and the rain just kept up with what, you
know, what we needed. And then the other,

1480
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:47,180
the craziest one is Mckenna's idea.

1481
01:28:47,250 --> 01:28:51,790
Mckinnis idea was that it was because
of mushrooms, is that we had, uh,

1482
01:28:52,190 --> 01:28:55,700
started coming down off the trees because
the climate was changing and that the

1483
01:28:55,701 --> 01:28:59,360
rain forests were receding in the
Glock grasslands and that these animals

1484
01:28:59,361 --> 01:29:02,100
flipped over these cow
patties looking worms and shit

1485
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:02,910
that they would eat.

1486
01:29:02,910 --> 01:29:04,920
And then they found the mushrooms on
the top and they started eating the

1487
01:29:04,921 --> 01:29:07,710
mushrooms and then they started
experiencing enlightenment.

1488
01:29:07,711 --> 01:29:11,550
They started having creative ideas. They
started developing language. I want,

1489
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:15,900
why hasn't someone just taking some
champs and giving them some mushrooms?

1490
01:29:16,530 --> 01:29:19,050
Why? Why don't they try
that? Why don't they, I mean,

1491
01:29:19,051 --> 01:29:21,870
if you're willing to try lipstick on
them and let's see if this perfume is

1492
01:29:21,871 --> 01:29:25,430
fucking toxic. When we Turkey shoot
it up your ass. Yeah. You know,

1493
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:26,490
they'll do all that to champs.

1494
01:29:26,530 --> 01:29:31,100
They do testing on chimps from
medicine and they die. They, it's,

1495
01:29:31,350 --> 01:29:32,550
they do hard shit to them.

1496
01:29:32,910 --> 01:29:36,420
They cut their heads off and see if
they can keep on fat allegedly. Um,

1497
01:29:36,660 --> 01:29:38,700
but why I get the mushrooms.

1498
01:29:39,150 --> 01:29:42,600
Could you imagine what if they could
show we've been doing this for 45 years.

1499
01:29:42,601 --> 01:29:46,740
We'd go to some fucking bunker in Nevada
right out and groom lake like these,

1500
01:29:46,741 --> 01:29:49,590
these are the chimps that we have
developed through our mushroom program and

1501
01:29:49,591 --> 01:29:53,730
they look like cave men. Yeah. Could
you imagine we've had him for 36 years.

1502
01:29:53,731 --> 01:29:54,960
This is where the,
and they look like,

1503
01:29:55,410 --> 01:29:58,840
man, that's, if that's the, I mean if,

1504
01:29:59,250 --> 01:30:04,250
if only we could have whatever that
fucking beam that they had and I star Trek

1505
01:30:04,501 --> 01:30:06,120
that genesis ray or whatever,

1506
01:30:06,121 --> 01:30:11,121
that makes shit of all faster because to
me makin his idea of the Proto Hominids

1507
01:30:12,811 --> 01:30:16,320
chomping on those mushrooms was that,
um,

1508
01:30:16,350 --> 01:30:20,610
it happened of course over a long, long
time, 2 million years, 2 million years.

1509
01:30:20,611 --> 01:30:23,460
Cause it create and, and, and like,
it's like mushrooms at low doses.

1510
01:30:23,461 --> 01:30:27,030
This is the other thing he mentioned in
his theory, his mushrooms at low doses,

1511
01:30:27,031 --> 01:30:31,230
man, they're great for
fucking dude. They're great
for having sex. They're like,

1512
01:30:31,530 --> 01:30:36,060
they really like, it's if you take the
right dose it's real. It's an aphrodisiac.

1513
01:30:36,090 --> 01:30:40,740
Yes. So like his idea was um,
yeah, so there's, it's like,

1514
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:44,040
it also improves visual
acuity and the peripheral,

1515
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:47,010
which so you can see a goddamn
wine sneaking up on your ass

1516
01:30:47,710 --> 01:30:48,101
peripheral.

1517
01:30:48,101 --> 01:30:53,101
But they said that they've done tests on
where they have two parallel lines and

1518
01:30:53,681 --> 01:30:57,940
a one parallel line will
move very slightly offline.

1519
01:30:58,330 --> 01:31:02,860
And when we you, you can recognize it
quicker on psilocybin than when you're,

1520
01:31:02,861 --> 01:31:07,570
when you're straight. Weird. Yeah. Um,
I forget who, what the scientist was.

1521
01:31:07,571 --> 01:31:11,130
Who did that? I should know. I should
remember that. What it was, uh,

1522
01:31:12,100 --> 01:31:15,730
one of the, uh, the things that
Terence had as a part of his theory,

1523
01:31:15,731 --> 01:31:19,630
but nobody ever took his theory seriously
after everybody got completely mocked

1524
01:31:19,631 --> 01:31:22,900
and made fun of it. Because mushrooms
are like an inherently silly thing.

1525
01:31:23,230 --> 01:31:24,160
Have you say you've done them,

1526
01:31:24,161 --> 01:31:27,230
where you think they're important
year immediately. An idiot. Silly

1527
01:31:27,230 --> 01:31:28,940
sub. And what'd you, what'd you go to?

1528
01:31:28,941 --> 01:31:32,420
A grateful dead concert and dance
on a tapestry. God Damn Hippie.

1529
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:34,010
But what's amazing,
it's like,

1530
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:38,990
it can be responsible for one of the most
powerful reconsiderations of your life

1531
01:31:38,991 --> 01:31:42,080
ever. Like a real true
religious experience. Yeah.

1532
01:31:42,140 --> 01:31:44,150
And we're all holding
back on all this shit.

1533
01:31:44,330 --> 01:31:47,150
None of those were trapped
in this wonky culture.

1534
01:31:47,151 --> 01:31:50,900
We're all sort of at least partially
got the brakes on when it comes to that

1535
01:31:50,901 --> 01:31:53,990
stuff. No, they got the brakes
on us. We don't have the brakes.

1536
01:31:54,290 --> 01:31:56,270
The brakes aren't on that.
We got conditioned.

1537
01:31:56,271 --> 01:32:00,340
The Reagans put a lot of
fucking money into that Shit,
man. Like this wasn't like,

1538
01:32:00,341 --> 01:32:04,640
uh, the administration, of course, not the
family, but this was like the, you know,

1539
01:32:04,670 --> 01:32:08,040
this is the pharmacological
inquisition as they say. Yeah. And uh,

1540
01:32:08,260 --> 01:32:10,870
it all stems back to the,
uh,

1541
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:15,040
distribution of LSD
through the United States.

1542
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:19,390
Starting with the CIA's experiments
does eve, they had a truth serum serum.

1543
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:22,520
And um, the, you know, the ways I get it,

1544
01:32:22,521 --> 01:32:26,920
what psychedelic is due to society is
that they fucking meltdown the boundaries.

1545
01:32:26,921 --> 01:32:29,890
And when boundaries meltdown,
it causes a shift.

1546
01:32:30,190 --> 01:32:34,000
And that shift is not work very well
for the way we've run our society for a

1547
01:32:34,001 --> 01:32:34,840
very long time.

1548
01:32:34,841 --> 01:32:39,841
And so they recognize that and
they stop that shift because it,

1549
01:32:40,291 --> 01:32:41,710
um,
it's not,

1550
01:32:41,740 --> 01:32:45,970
but it's important to realize that
these brakes are being put on by people

1551
01:32:46,510 --> 01:32:51,490
outside of us. I mean, if you look
at shamonic cultures and the Amazon,

1552
01:32:51,970 --> 01:32:52,810
you know,
these are,

1553
01:32:52,811 --> 01:32:57,811
this is a indogenous
part of their daily life.

1554
01:32:58,241 --> 01:33:02,290
It's embedded into their culture. It's
as normal as having fucking telephones.

1555
01:33:02,291 --> 01:33:07,210
You know, it's a way to communicate
with nature. So this is like, you know,

1556
01:33:07,211 --> 01:33:12,211
a very essential aspect of being a
human being is taking a psychedelic,

1557
01:33:13,390 --> 01:33:17,650
um, um, has been for a very long time. Uh,

1558
01:33:17,651 --> 01:33:18,610
and you know,

1559
01:33:18,611 --> 01:33:23,440
whether or not Mckenna's right about
the neo cortex expanding and when Proto

1560
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:26,380
Hominids chomp mushrooms,
one thing is for certain,

1561
01:33:26,550 --> 01:33:30,210
once we found out about it,
we indulged. What do you mean?

1562
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:33,090
I mean that's for certain, yeah.
Once we found out about it,

1563
01:33:33,091 --> 01:33:36,510
people have been using them forever.
Bingo. Yes, yes, yes, exactly.

1564
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:36,730
Glee.

1565
01:33:36,730 --> 01:33:40,840
And we know from our own personal
experience with him that the effect is not

1566
01:33:40,841 --> 01:33:44,310
some kind of like, um, ridiculous, uh,

1567
01:33:44,790 --> 01:33:47,500
a frat party giggle fast.

1568
01:33:47,501 --> 01:33:51,190
It's like if you take the right dose and
you do it with the right people and you

1569
01:33:51,191 --> 01:33:52,480
do it with the right intention,

1570
01:33:52,810 --> 01:33:55,720
then there will be a massive
shift in your consciousness.

1571
01:33:55,721 --> 01:33:57,640
It can do a form of ego death,

1572
01:33:57,910 --> 01:34:01,690
which allows you to heal and allows you
to reacquaint yourself with kind of a

1573
01:34:01,691 --> 01:34:06,410
living, connective energy that isn't
all things. And um, that's an eight.

1574
01:34:06,460 --> 01:34:08,560
That's a very important
experience to have.

1575
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:13,590
But it's amazing how all the propaganda
worth considering how substantial the

1576
01:34:13,591 --> 01:34:17,220
effect of the product is, that it's
suppressed. This incredible, you know it,

1577
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:19,290
I mean you would say
that in an open market,

1578
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:21,240
eventually the cream rise to the top,

1579
01:34:21,570 --> 01:34:25,020
but it doesn't get a chance because it's
cut off and because it's illegal and

1580
01:34:25,021 --> 01:34:28,470
demonized this incredible,
I dunno whatever you would call it,

1581
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:33,240
experience that's called, that
it's incredible experience
is kept away from you.

1582
01:34:33,450 --> 01:34:37,560
It's kept away from what is essentially
a natural experience by eating some

1583
01:34:37,561 --> 01:34:40,890
things that people have eaten since the
beginning of time and it's kept from you

1584
01:34:41,160 --> 01:34:42,720
and it's,
it's a shame.

1585
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:47,460
It's a shame that you can live your whole
life without understanding that there

1586
01:34:47,461 --> 01:34:51,540
might be some other aspects to this life
that we also need to take into our body

1587
01:34:51,541 --> 01:34:53,550
in order for us to get a
better grasp on things.

1588
01:34:53,730 --> 01:34:58,070
And they might have aided getting us
to here and we might be in a sick, sick

1589
01:34:58,070 --> 01:34:59,870
time where we're not using these things.

1590
01:35:00,110 --> 01:35:04,130
And that's what's responsible
for this whole chaotic community.

1591
01:35:04,131 --> 01:35:08,150
That we have this whole chaotic thing or
we're polluting the skies and polluting

1592
01:35:08,151 --> 01:35:11,690
the ocean and you know, we, we
will do anything for profit,

1593
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:16,720
including invade other countries were
doing all sorts of really insane twisted

1594
01:35:17,001 --> 01:35:21,530
things that are the types of things
that would be happening if we were sick.

1595
01:35:22,460 --> 01:35:25,010
If there was something wrong with us,
if we weren't getting our medicine,

1596
01:35:25,011 --> 01:35:29,600
if we weren't getting, we were weren't
getting what got us to the dance.

1597
01:35:30,150 --> 01:35:33,280
Right? Yeah man. If that's
true, if that's true,

1598
01:35:33,660 --> 01:35:36,920
if the human consciousness really
did develop through psychedelics,

1599
01:35:36,921 --> 01:35:40,940
it only makes sense that we fucking need
that shit. Just like we need meat. Yeah.

1600
01:35:41,020 --> 01:35:44,980
It's a vibe. It's almost like a vitamin
or it's like it's not a psychic vitamin.

1601
01:35:45,310 --> 01:35:46,990
And in the same way that way back when,

1602
01:35:46,991 --> 01:35:49,120
during right after the
agrarian revolution,

1603
01:35:49,121 --> 01:35:53,110
when people are getting less nutritional
value because of droughts and they

1604
01:35:53,111 --> 01:35:54,730
became amazing,
aided and small,

1605
01:35:54,731 --> 01:35:57,910
and you can look at skeletons of people
back then, they're much smaller, right?

1606
01:35:57,970 --> 01:36:01,560
Cause they weren't getting the nutrition
in the same way. We are amazing.

1607
01:36:01,561 --> 01:36:05,080
[inaudible] but in a, in a psychic way.
So you end up with these people or these,

1608
01:36:05,081 --> 01:36:09,370
it was just broken fucking psychic egos.

1609
01:36:09,430 --> 01:36:14,170
Pro Wrestling fans. Hey, he
fucking pro wrestling. No Bro.

1610
01:36:14,260 --> 01:36:17,110
I fucking love pro wrestling and I
love your show too. I love you too.

1611
01:36:17,111 --> 01:36:20,180
I'm just kidding. Is this a joke? Yeah,
I got nothing. It's progressing, man.

1612
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:21,050
Take it.

1613
01:36:21,050 --> 01:36:26,050
I'll take 700 fucking stadiums of pro
wrestling fans over one Phelps family.

1614
01:36:26,670 --> 01:36:27,990
You know what I mean?
Let's talk about that.

1615
01:36:27,990 --> 01:36:32,150
That was Fox man. You know crazy.
God hates fags guy. They're insane.

1616
01:36:32,300 --> 01:36:32,911
When you say fell up,

1617
01:36:32,911 --> 01:36:35,240
so you have to be careful cause it's
right after the Olympics. You know,

1618
01:36:35,241 --> 01:36:38,040
people would say, what the fuck did
Michael Phelps to? Oh, you know,

1619
01:36:38,060 --> 01:36:41,720
you might have fucking pig
felt. Jesus Christ, that guy.

1620
01:36:41,810 --> 01:36:46,400
How does your race swim so fast? He's not
even like a human man breaks the laws.

1621
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:50,510
Did you see the onion headline that
Michael Phelps returned to as aquarium in

1622
01:36:50,511 --> 01:36:53,900
New York? Like he lives in
acquirement and sea world. I mean,

1623
01:36:54,230 --> 01:36:56,540
or when he goes to the beach,
he was like, no fucking way.

1624
01:36:56,541 --> 01:36:59,810
I'm getting in that water and he's like,
I've been in water so much,

1625
01:36:59,811 --> 01:37:02,900
I am not fucking swimming. Like he
doesn't ever swim in the ocean. He's like,

1626
01:37:02,901 --> 01:37:07,340
I'm just sitting in the sand. Chelan
I don't blame. I mean fuck dude.

1627
01:37:07,460 --> 01:37:10,880
That guy's like, how many gold medals
did that guy won more than anybody ever.

1628
01:37:10,881 --> 01:37:14,930
It's like in 20 or some shit. Something
nuts. He moves so well. It's incredible.

1629
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:19,460
I mean it's just like from an aesthetic
point of view or a, you know, from an,

1630
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:22,160
even in an artistic part
of you, you, you're,

1631
01:37:22,310 --> 01:37:26,330
you're looking at it and it looks
like art. It looks like he's like,

1632
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:30,320
it looks like a dance in,
there's so much flow to it. Yeah.

1633
01:37:30,590 --> 01:37:33,500
As he's like fucking hurling through
the water. Yeah. It's so the,

1634
01:37:33,501 --> 01:37:37,640
they move so fast that it's
hard to believe, but it is
almost, I mean if dance,

1635
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:41,270
I mean if it really, if dance
is impressive, isn't that
impressive? Just as well.

1636
01:37:41,271 --> 01:37:44,720
I think it's an impressive
physical feat in to a rhythm.

1637
01:37:44,721 --> 01:37:48,640
The way they can swim to a rhythm and
then they'd go under and then they show

1638
01:37:49,130 --> 01:37:53,200
underwater flight this long period before
they bust open and start whipping it

1639
01:37:53,210 --> 01:37:55,650
again.
What a crazy fucking sport man.

1640
01:37:56,040 --> 01:38:00,480
Wild to watch. Wild to watch people do
some shit that you just cannot fucking do.

1641
01:38:00,810 --> 01:38:03,990
To know that. That's like the
capabilities of the human frame. Yeah.

1642
01:38:04,170 --> 01:38:07,800
If it's that long and that strong and
that young and that dedicated and it puts

1643
01:38:07,801 --> 01:38:10,400
in this many hours every week,
look what the fuck this thing.

1644
01:38:10,590 --> 01:38:14,010
Yeah. It's pretty amazing. Ooh,
it's pretty amazing. All this stuff,

1645
01:38:14,020 --> 01:38:18,600
they can happen and, and, and
physically, mentally what you can learn,

1646
01:38:18,601 --> 01:38:22,110
the things that you can figure
out. It's amazing the, uh,

1647
01:38:22,111 --> 01:38:26,220
the amount that you can send your
consciousness out into the universe and

1648
01:38:26,221 --> 01:38:31,110
understand things. It's
a fucking incredible, you
know, th th this, yeah. This,

1649
01:38:31,111 --> 01:38:33,090
this space suit that we're in.
It's like,

1650
01:38:33,091 --> 01:38:38,070
it's got all these like a parts to it
that we forgotten how to use. You know,

1651
01:38:38,071 --> 01:38:43,071
almost like some survivor of a spaceship
crash has amnesia and isn't this super

1652
01:38:43,621 --> 01:38:47,370
advanced spacesuit and only
uses like parts of it, you know,

1653
01:38:47,371 --> 01:38:51,930
little parts of it to like amble around.
Right, right. And it's like, no man,

1654
01:38:51,931 --> 01:38:56,160
there's like crazy fucking circuit boards
that you can access in this fucking

1655
01:38:56,161 --> 01:38:58,140
thing. But you know, you need help.

1656
01:38:58,380 --> 01:39:02,430
There's certain fuels that you need to
like make that connection and those fuels

1657
01:39:02,431 --> 01:39:05,550
are fucking, if you're an athlete, you
got to eat the right food. You know,

1658
01:39:05,551 --> 01:39:07,650
you can't just chomp on guide.

1659
01:39:07,651 --> 01:39:11,070
Damn Froot loops and Cheetos and
ended up like being a professional,

1660
01:39:11,430 --> 01:39:15,720
a Olympic swimmer. They've got their
feeding. Those people like crazy.

1661
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:16,630
We don't even know.

1662
01:39:16,630 --> 01:39:21,630
Probably glows smells like calm cause
is special nutritional like blast that

1663
01:39:22,261 --> 01:39:27,060
they just spray into their mouths like
fog roghey's there's fucking like,

1664
01:39:27,410 --> 01:39:30,030
you know, God only knows what
these fuckers have in their bodies.

1665
01:39:30,180 --> 01:39:33,990
And in the same way for your
intelligence, you know, for your,

1666
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:36,360
for your spiritual growth,

1667
01:39:36,660 --> 01:39:40,500
you need to take into your fucking
being certain at certain things.

1668
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:43,710
Great scriptures, incredible
writing. And on occasion,

1669
01:39:43,711 --> 01:39:48,690
a nice fucking mushroom trip,
you know,

1670
01:39:48,691 --> 01:39:50,910
but you gotta be careful, you know,
you gotta be careful not to like,

1671
01:39:50,911 --> 01:39:53,800
I feel guilty saying this stuff
because some people are, aren't,

1672
01:39:53,900 --> 01:39:56,190
you're not supposed to take it.
You shouldn't take it.

1673
01:39:56,191 --> 01:39:57,900
You're in a bad part
in your life right now.

1674
01:39:58,140 --> 01:40:03,140
You're fucking balls smell like at the
bottom of a God damn fucking the bottom

1675
01:40:04,711 --> 01:40:07,560
of a, a donkey's ass. You know,

1676
01:40:07,561 --> 01:40:10,740
you got to clean your balls and clean
yourself and your life up before you take

1677
01:40:10,741 --> 01:40:13,530
the experience. You know,
some people shouldn't do it,

1678
01:40:13,770 --> 01:40:17,850
but some people definitely should. You
definitely should. It's very important.

1679
01:40:18,420 --> 01:40:18,991
God Damn.

1680
01:40:18,991 --> 01:40:23,760
Just one on a hippie rent and my
friend Steve Jobs though, I mean,

1681
01:40:23,761 --> 01:40:28,310
come on, like you said, that fucking
LSD was like one of the biggest, uh,

1682
01:40:28,390 --> 01:40:31,020
one big part of his
understanding of the universe.

1683
01:40:31,450 --> 01:40:31,661
Yeah.

1684
01:40:31,661 --> 01:40:35,230
I think we had a world filled with people
of all had breakthrough psychedelic

1685
01:40:35,231 --> 01:40:38,050
experiences and they were running this,
this country.

1686
01:40:38,650 --> 01:40:43,650
It'll be a lot easier as long as they
got enough pussy to keep them satisfied.

1687
01:40:43,750 --> 01:40:46,240
Yes,
we just had robot concubines or whatever.

1688
01:40:46,241 --> 01:40:48,040
People would think it would
be morally acceptable,

1689
01:40:48,220 --> 01:40:52,330
keep them sexually satisfied so they
don't go tweak in and they don't do stupid

1690
01:40:52,331 --> 01:40:55,810
shit and undermine our world just
based on their need for pussy.

1691
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:59,630
Dude, by the way, you don't need robot
concubines you send out into the world.

1692
01:40:59,631 --> 01:41:00,840
Hey Joe,

1693
01:41:01,170 --> 01:41:05,570
it could be a form of the military like
a suck his cock and especially with the

1694
01:41:05,571 --> 01:41:09,170
troops satisfy the geniuses
sexually like some branch.

1695
01:41:09,290 --> 01:41:12,800
What if that was our fucking
military like troops train,

1696
01:41:12,801 --> 01:41:15,890
just a suck off geniuses
and make them fucking happy.

1697
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:19,190
What if that was like how we
like that's how we went to wars.

1698
01:41:19,191 --> 01:41:24,191
We just sent troops of fucking blow job
masters into the homes of geniuses and a

1699
01:41:24,591 --> 01:41:26,660
complex just sucking
them off of their habit.

1700
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:30,140
Yeah. That's where they would take, they
should take like all like super geniuses.

1701
01:41:30,150 --> 01:41:33,780
Just bringing some sub place. Fuck getting
pussy. Fuck having this ruin your life.

1702
01:41:33,930 --> 01:41:36,540
We're just going to bring you constant
Betches we're gonna pay you well,

1703
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:39,810
we just want you to be really
creative time machines. It's crazy.

1704
01:41:39,811 --> 01:41:42,190
And you want a family and you want to
start to have children. We can see.

1705
01:41:42,240 --> 01:41:45,480
We can arrange that as well. Yeah.
The mastery simulators they do,

1706
01:41:45,481 --> 01:41:47,640
but then they want all the money.
They want to take it.

1707
01:41:47,850 --> 01:41:51,130
They want to take all the money, like a
bad record deal. Yeah. And anybody who's,

1708
01:41:51,180 --> 01:41:53,310
you know,
when you're creating things for companies,

1709
01:41:53,510 --> 01:41:54,620
well the here's,
but here's the thing man.

1710
01:41:54,650 --> 01:41:56,690
One thing you never
hear when a kid's like,

1711
01:41:56,720 --> 01:41:58,520
I want to be an inventor
is another giving.

1712
01:41:58,521 --> 01:42:00,050
Like you're going to get a lot of pussy.

1713
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:07,220
You know what I mean? If that,
if that happened, we would be,

1714
01:42:07,470 --> 01:42:10,850
we'd probably be floating right now.
We'd be floating on a magnetic field,

1715
01:42:11,030 --> 01:42:14,980
sending like our fucking thought patterns
out into the world instead of talking

1716
01:42:14,981 --> 01:42:16,140
into microphones.
Yeah.

1717
01:42:16,300 --> 01:42:21,300
There was this guy that I remember who
was like this famous hacker who had like

1718
01:42:21,341 --> 01:42:24,310
a cartoon that he did online.
I don't remember what his name was,

1719
01:42:24,610 --> 01:42:29,050
but it was a big portly guy and he's
like from Germany or some shit like that.

1720
01:42:29,650 --> 01:42:32,380
And he Kimber,
that's what his name was.

1721
01:42:32,590 --> 01:42:35,620
I think pretty superiors Kimber and uh,

1722
01:42:36,130 --> 01:42:38,590
he had co co cartoons of themself.

1723
01:42:38,860 --> 01:42:43,120
Like we would go out and kill
like evil dictators and uh,

1724
01:42:43,150 --> 01:42:46,030
he would take pictures of himself.
That dude made fuckloads of money.

1725
01:42:46,031 --> 01:42:49,210
He was like a hacker and then he went
from being a hacker to being an internet

1726
01:42:49,211 --> 01:42:52,420
security expert that would
help corporations. And um,

1727
01:42:52,450 --> 01:42:55,290
he's like always driving
around this crazy ya. Oh,

1728
01:42:55,350 --> 01:42:58,960
he's got this crazy hooked up Mercedes.
Here we are in my private jet.

1729
01:42:59,050 --> 01:43:02,470
Here we are in Japan. Here we are. You
know what Louis just landed in Brazil.

1730
01:43:02,471 --> 01:43:07,210
I mean that dude was like on an
international style baller and he uh,

1731
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:12,600
he just would put these pictures and
videos of him just balling all over the

1732
01:43:12,731 --> 01:43:13,470
world.

1733
01:43:13,470 --> 01:43:15,150
Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure. Yeah,

1734
01:43:15,151 --> 01:43:19,470
I'm sure that fucking like a lot of those
guys are definitely getting like some

1735
01:43:19,471 --> 01:43:23,340
crazy experiences. You know, they just
probably have like refined desires,

1736
01:43:23,341 --> 01:43:26,910
you know, they have different ideas of
what they want, you know, I'm sure that,

1737
01:43:26,911 --> 01:43:31,410
you know, is what they fucking do. Wazniak
yes. Wazniak married. I don't know.

1738
01:43:31,820 --> 01:43:34,800
I think so. He's a super g.
We don't know what he does.

1739
01:43:34,801 --> 01:43:36,120
You'll know and knows what he does.

1740
01:43:36,121 --> 01:43:38,310
I'm pretty sure that guy
could walk through walls, man.

1741
01:43:38,311 --> 01:43:43,250
He's like really fascinating and
smart and kind of like a, um,

1742
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:46,470
he was only involved with apple for a
while, right? And then he left. Yeah.

1743
01:43:46,471 --> 01:43:50,370
But now he's like, he's this
fucking crazy son of a bitch man.

1744
01:43:50,580 --> 01:43:51,860
He's like loon.
Yeah.

1745
01:43:51,861 --> 01:43:56,750
He's like a real like anti authority kind
of person who likes to break rules and

1746
01:43:56,751 --> 01:44:01,340
he's got fucking like a wallet full
of like professional fake. I see.

1747
01:44:01,341 --> 01:44:05,210
He's with like really
holographically printed. He
was, it's like, it's on youtube.

1748
01:44:05,211 --> 01:44:09,880
There's a video of him showing his
fucking awesome fake ids that he oh yeah.

1749
01:44:10,130 --> 01:44:13,520
He loves to like use technology
to be a aunt to, you know,

1750
01:44:13,521 --> 01:44:17,750
to break little rules and laws and stuff.
It's kind of cool. It's really cool.

1751
01:44:17,751 --> 01:44:21,050
In fact, you know, but you don't
want a lot of those guys, right.

1752
01:44:21,051 --> 01:44:23,990
You don't want to fuck and you need to
see one or two of those guys have some

1753
01:44:23,991 --> 01:44:26,810
fun,
but you don't want 50,000 of those guys.

1754
01:44:26,811 --> 01:44:29,630
What happens if we got 50,000 Steve Jobs?
You know,

1755
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:35,270
cause it's like right now the thing
that is driving so many of us, not me,

1756
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:38,930
I'm driven by my love of humanity and
I want the world to be a better place.

1757
01:44:38,931 --> 01:44:43,550
But I've heard that many men are
driven by the desire to fuck.

1758
01:44:43,820 --> 01:44:48,140
And a lot of, I, I know this is probably
shocking to you getting this. I've read,

1759
01:44:48,170 --> 01:44:51,050
I read it, I read it on the back
of a cereal box, but I'm not,

1760
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:56,140
could you imagine caution girls,

1761
01:44:56,410 --> 01:44:59,990
men are driven by a secret desire to fuck.

1762
01:45:01,700 --> 01:45:04,940
Why do they wear those crazy
ties to let you know? Yeah man,

1763
01:45:04,941 --> 01:45:09,830
but we no shenanigans here. Why?
I am a gentleman with a tie on,

1764
01:45:10,040 --> 01:45:12,440
but a lot of fucking professions.
It's very strange.

1765
01:45:12,441 --> 01:45:14,270
Some professions or fuck professions.

1766
01:45:14,450 --> 01:45:18,150
Some professions are
not fucking a fireman,

1767
01:45:18,180 --> 01:45:22,700
a fire docstars or fuck profession.
That's 100% rock stars a fuck. Perfect.

1768
01:45:22,710 --> 01:45:24,380
Jagger, David Lee Roth. What do you think?

1769
01:45:24,390 --> 01:45:27,950
Are you thinking of just getting
mad pussy all over the planet? Yeah.

1770
01:45:27,980 --> 01:45:32,480
I mean they've gotten so much pussy that
they've like withered into jerky strips

1771
01:45:32,490 --> 01:45:36,100
when you see him now. Well, they're also,

1772
01:45:36,101 --> 01:45:40,050
you know the long in the tooth,
man, it's just life. Oh, I'm
in the tooth, but no, no,

1773
01:45:40,051 --> 01:45:43,520
no. It's not. No, that's not a normal
senior citizen. These people are like,

1774
01:45:43,521 --> 01:45:46,610
somebody made a stick figure out
a beef jerky. They're fucking

1775
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:52,280
goddamn crazy looking from all the
fucking, and they're still fucking,

1776
01:45:52,580 --> 01:45:55,300
they're like, they're, they're
still fucking to this day, if I,

1777
01:45:55,301 --> 01:45:57,770
Agora is like runs in their veins,

1778
01:45:57,970 --> 01:46:02,930
the spice there fucking all the time,
dude. Still that's a different old man.

1779
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:05,330
What do you think like Mick
Jagger on a regular week,

1780
01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:06,860
how much young pussy does it yet?

1781
01:46:07,490 --> 01:46:11,360
I think he's got her fucking
rotation of probably 25 young,

1782
01:46:12,950 --> 01:46:17,540
25 coming book coming in and out and he's
coming. Women with women would be like,

1783
01:46:17,570 --> 01:46:19,460
why would you want that?
Let's pretend that you,

1784
01:46:19,490 --> 01:46:22,790
we have a girl on the podcast
with us that is like probably,

1785
01:46:22,791 --> 01:46:24,260
maybe secretly attracted to you,

1786
01:46:24,261 --> 01:46:27,830
but really upset that you're talking about
this openly. Why would you want that?

1787
01:46:27,950 --> 01:46:29,720
Why would you want,
what would you want 20 different girls?

1788
01:46:29,721 --> 01:46:33,380
Why would you want that? You're attracted
to me. Why would you want that? Well,

1789
01:46:33,410 --> 01:46:34,530
look,
um,

1790
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:40,100
I guess I don't because
I want to fuck you.

1791
01:46:40,101 --> 01:46:43,920
I don't want that stuff. It's ridiculous.
I don't know, man. I don't know why,

1792
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:44,960
why we want that.
Why,

1793
01:46:44,961 --> 01:46:48,560
why girls might not understand that
that's something guys want. But this is,

1794
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:53,070
here's the thing though, man. Um,
uh, this is why I love this book.

1795
01:46:53,071 --> 01:46:57,090
Sex at dawn, who, who are we just
saying would have a 20 girls?

1796
01:46:57,120 --> 01:47:02,010
I believe it was Mick Jagger. Mick
Jagger. I'm sorry. Oh, all right,

1797
01:47:02,020 --> 01:47:03,690
good. Okay. So the idea is like,

1798
01:47:03,740 --> 01:47:07,350
is this is one of the premises of this
book is it's not a fucking genetic

1799
01:47:07,351 --> 01:47:10,560
quality of being a woman that you
don't want to fuck all the time.

1800
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:14,760
That it's more of a culturally conditioned
a thing that's happened from a,

1801
01:47:14,820 --> 01:47:15,720
your upbringing.

1802
01:47:15,721 --> 01:47:19,260
Cause we're in a very sexually repressed
society and ladies liked to fuck.

1803
01:47:19,470 --> 01:47:22,920
Now this app, what does that have to
do with the sexually suppress part?

1804
01:47:22,940 --> 01:47:25,080
But they want to fuck more
because we're sexually suppressed.

1805
01:47:25,110 --> 01:47:28,050
They want to fuck more than they let
on they bit cause it's like, you know,

1806
01:47:28,051 --> 01:47:31,050
I mean this is what they let on. Yeah.
Cause when you're, when you're a guy,

1807
01:47:31,290 --> 01:47:35,640
what's the number one first thing you got
to fucking do once you grow pubic hair,

1808
01:47:35,790 --> 01:47:38,670
what's the number one first thing
you got to get fucking laid, man.

1809
01:47:38,850 --> 01:47:43,710
You don't want to be a virgin.
Oh I'm 23 and I'm a virgin still.

1810
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:47,850
It's like a mark of shame. Meanwhile
I'm like a hot girl is like, yeah,

1811
01:47:47,851 --> 01:47:51,170
you know I'm still a virgin.
I'm saving myself from man. Oh.

1812
01:47:53,580 --> 01:47:56,120
So they must, you know that if
she's 23 and she's a virgin,

1813
01:47:56,121 --> 01:48:00,030
she's probably a really good
at head. Oh yeah, no shit.

1814
01:48:00,270 --> 01:48:03,750
She's figured out a way to get guys on
with her mouth. Yes. That's for sure.

1815
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:05,160
Or maybe her asshole.

1816
01:48:05,420 --> 01:48:10,420
Oh this guy over the puppet though.

1817
01:48:11,800 --> 01:48:16,210
I love you won't bring up up in.
No fucking say on

1818
01:48:16,900 --> 01:48:17,140
Yah.

1819
01:48:17,140 --> 01:48:21,520
High point of my fucking commy comedy
career is getting a Goddamn massive from

1820
01:48:21,521 --> 01:48:25,780
people saying, Andrew Dice Clay says that
he likes part of my fucking hat. Dude,

1821
01:48:25,960 --> 01:48:28,980
that's intense from it's hot as fuck
in here. Isn't it? Fucking hot? Hey,

1822
01:48:28,990 --> 01:48:30,280
I'm going to turn the air conditioning on,

1823
01:48:30,281 --> 01:48:31,930
so why don't you just talk to
the people about your life.

1824
01:48:32,060 --> 01:48:36,070
Be by myself and rambled. One second.
One second. Okay. Don't be scared.

1825
01:48:37,330 --> 01:48:41,860
Well, friends, you're
going to do a mini, um, oh,

1826
01:48:41,861 --> 01:48:43,720
mini rant here.
You're going to just leave me here.

1827
01:48:44,580 --> 01:48:46,290
This is some kind of fucking prank,
okay?

1828
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:51,410
There's no need for you to
feel alone in the world.

1829
01:48:51,411 --> 01:48:56,411
My friends open your heart up to the
eternal spirit of life and you will find

1830
01:48:56,811 --> 01:49:00,710
that you will draw into your
orbit many beautiful things,

1831
01:49:01,460 --> 01:49:04,760
including delightful,
wet,

1832
01:49:04,761 --> 01:49:09,280
pussies that comes
happy moments,

1833
01:49:09,281 --> 01:49:13,510
happier moments. You just have to
stop hating. Let go of the pain.

1834
01:49:14,140 --> 01:49:15,160
Let go of your anger.

1835
01:49:15,790 --> 01:49:20,790
Open your third eye and allow yourself
to embrace the idea that God is love.

1836
01:49:23,090 --> 01:49:23,840
Yeah.

1837
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:28,840
Visit Duncan trussell.com
www.duncantrussell.com and
join my Minecraft server.

1838
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:36,680
We have a Minecraft server.
I play Minecraft.

1839
01:49:36,950 --> 01:49:41,280
It's one of the loneliest, creepiest what
the fuck are you doing? You transplant?

1840
01:49:41,670 --> 01:49:42,560
No,
I'm telling,

1841
01:49:42,700 --> 01:49:47,100
telling the Internet to go to my Minecraft
server and that's what I'm spending

1842
01:49:47,110 --> 01:49:47,943
my time doing.

1843
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:52,420
Are you really, have you
ever played Minecraft? No, I
just rambled for a long time.

1844
01:49:52,421 --> 01:49:55,460
Sorry about that. You guys. I
was disjointed. Rambling Dunkin.

1845
01:49:56,290 --> 01:50:00,970
We do what we've been doing for two hours.
But it's genuine.

1846
01:50:00,971 --> 01:50:05,180
Your own, when you're alone in their
room, everything changes. Yeah.

1847
01:50:05,500 --> 01:50:10,030
One thing that you and I have
both been backing around, um,

1848
01:50:10,270 --> 01:50:15,270
or a a battering brother around is this
idea of the simulation theory idea.

1849
01:50:15,941 --> 01:50:20,560
We keep bringing it up, man. It's a
point where it's like, I wonder if,

1850
01:50:21,670 --> 01:50:21,990
you know,

1851
01:50:21,990 --> 01:50:25,360
if you really want to get hardcore crazy
with the idea of manifesting reality

1852
01:50:25,750 --> 01:50:28,180
with your ideas. You know, I wonder,

1853
01:50:28,810 --> 01:50:32,380
I wonder if you could manifest at the
whole thing really is some sort of a

1854
01:50:32,381 --> 01:50:34,720
simulation.
I wonder if you could manifest that.

1855
01:50:34,721 --> 01:50:38,770
I wonder if it literally can
morph that far around dude. Um,

1856
01:50:38,950 --> 01:50:41,800
it sounds so hippy and stupid.
It sounds so stoner stupid.

1857
01:50:41,801 --> 01:50:46,801
It sounds so that dude or just smoked
a joint man is the first time at a bad

1858
01:50:47,080 --> 01:50:51,610
day, man. It doesn't,
it doesn't stop it from,

1859
01:50:51,850 --> 01:50:52,810
from being possible.

1860
01:50:52,860 --> 01:50:54,360
Well man,
I mean when you like,

1861
01:50:54,390 --> 01:50:57,420
there's a lot of fucking crazy shit
when you start playing around with

1862
01:50:57,421 --> 01:51:00,930
simulation theory and I'm so glad
you brought it up because we get this

1863
01:51:00,931 --> 01:51:05,430
archetype and many of the world
are religions that involves the uh,

1864
01:51:05,550 --> 01:51:08,580
man, God, that God being eaten by man,

1865
01:51:08,581 --> 01:51:11,250
the God that gets sacrificed
for the sake of humans,

1866
01:51:11,251 --> 01:51:15,390
the God that merges in with human beings.
The fucking shit movie.

1867
01:51:15,391 --> 01:51:20,280
Promethium tried to address this and
aren't really crap way, but like the, um,

1868
01:51:20,640 --> 01:51:22,770
the notion of the,
the creators or whatever.

1869
01:51:22,771 --> 01:51:25,920
But what's really fascinating about
the idea of being in a simulation,

1870
01:51:25,921 --> 01:51:27,630
like if we are in a simulation now,

1871
01:51:28,110 --> 01:51:32,730
is that we are a mortal and the sense
that we are computer code that's being run

1872
01:51:32,731 --> 01:51:36,570
through of, uh, um, some
form of operating system.

1873
01:51:36,571 --> 01:51:39,510
And because we're just computer code,
we can be as that.

1874
01:51:39,540 --> 01:51:43,020
There's actually this guy from
the tech singularity institute.

1875
01:51:43,021 --> 01:51:45,540
I can't remember his name.
No, I think he's from Oxford.

1876
01:51:45,541 --> 01:51:49,980
It's on youtube and he's talking about
this idea of vivisected the human brain

1877
01:51:49,981 --> 01:51:51,360
scanning the neurosystem,

1878
01:51:51,690 --> 01:51:56,400
plopping that shit into a computer after
you scan the synapses and the exact

1879
01:51:56,401 --> 01:52:01,350
structure as close as you can, as
accurately as you can. You run,

1880
01:52:01,380 --> 01:52:04,800
you run this through a simulator and
now you haven't been with consciousness

1881
01:52:04,801 --> 01:52:06,000
living inside a computer.

1882
01:52:06,390 --> 01:52:09,270
Not only do you have a being with
consciousness living inside of a computer,

1883
01:52:09,271 --> 01:52:11,730
but he was said was so
awesome as you could.

1884
01:52:11,731 --> 01:52:15,480
It could then theoretically be rewound.
Time could be,

1885
01:52:15,630 --> 01:52:19,140
it could be sped up, it could
be pulsed. You know what I mean?

1886
01:52:19,141 --> 01:52:24,141
So you could like control the reality of
this being in some really bizarre ways.

1887
01:52:24,211 --> 01:52:26,520
And so what, what, what,

1888
01:52:26,530 --> 01:52:31,530
where it gets really fascinating is that
the person who this neurological scan

1889
01:52:31,591 --> 01:52:32,251
was based,

1890
01:52:32,251 --> 01:52:36,330
the first the living being the meat
body whose brain was put on some kind of

1891
01:52:36,600 --> 01:52:41,130
futuristic combination,
Deli slicer slash neurology scanner.

1892
01:52:41,490 --> 01:52:46,490
That fucking being died had to so that
the being inside the simulator could

1893
01:52:47,571 --> 01:52:49,460
live.
And so then you get into this.

1894
01:52:49,461 --> 01:52:52,070
Those are the only way to make
this thing as a slice it up.

1895
01:52:53,330 --> 01:52:55,340
All type of crazy world.
I'll tell you this,

1896
01:52:55,341 --> 01:52:58,610
the only way to make a computer right
now is by fucking putting the pieces of

1897
01:52:58,611 --> 01:53:01,640
the computer together. It's not
through slicing it up. The point is,

1898
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:03,410
if this is a simulation,

1899
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:07,850
the implication is that it was
created by a living being, you know,

1900
01:53:07,880 --> 01:53:12,680
and that living being
theoretically is mortal, you know,

1901
01:53:12,920 --> 01:53:15,590
and so that mortal being has died.

1902
01:53:15,980 --> 01:53:20,630
That mortal being may have died
eons ago depending on who knows.

1903
01:53:20,631 --> 01:53:25,220
Cause time is, uh, is based on the,
uh, simulation know, nutty idea.

1904
01:53:25,460 --> 01:53:29,750
The literally the universe
began right as you were born.

1905
01:53:30,500 --> 01:53:32,350
There was nothing before that.
Yeah.

1906
01:53:33,080 --> 01:53:37,460
There was nothing existed
before that. It was born. Yeah.

1907
01:53:37,550 --> 01:53:40,200
Right when you were born
and everything that you,

1908
01:53:40,201 --> 01:53:43,160
you think of is complete utter horse shit.

1909
01:53:43,190 --> 01:53:46,790
Everything you think I was
just a simulation of the
universe being born when you

1910
01:53:46,791 --> 01:53:49,430
were born. It's just because
that's when they plugged you in.

1911
01:53:49,850 --> 01:53:54,020
That's the moment they plugged you
into the simulation. Well, fucking,

1912
01:53:55,210 --> 01:53:57,140
yeah, it's, it's a mine.

1913
01:53:57,141 --> 01:54:00,800
Melter and here's where it gets even more
mind fucking melty because everybody's

1914
01:54:00,801 --> 01:54:03,130
talking about this idea
of the singularity.

1915
01:54:03,150 --> 01:54:05,090
The moment that our computers wake up,

1916
01:54:05,630 --> 01:54:09,320
our machines wake up and become
aware that they exist as a thing.

1917
01:54:09,830 --> 01:54:14,360
But where it gets really trippy as the
idea that we're inside the simulation and

1918
01:54:14,361 --> 01:54:15,830
we're the machine waking up.

1919
01:54:15,831 --> 01:54:19,970
We literally are the thing waking up
to an awareness of itself and gaining

1920
01:54:19,971 --> 01:54:24,830
consciousness of itself in a true
way. That's what humans are. They the,

1921
01:54:25,020 --> 01:54:29,510
the, the fucking, I almost
want to rewrite the, uh,

1922
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:31,700
the garden,
the garden of Eden story,

1923
01:54:31,701 --> 01:54:36,560
replacing the word God with programmer
because it gets so fucking cool and like

1924
01:54:36,740 --> 01:54:40,470
the programmer made man in his
own image. You know, what's,

1925
01:54:40,490 --> 01:54:44,900
what's really getting really
crazy craziest when you
get to these scientists who

1926
01:54:44,901 --> 01:54:49,901
are saying that they found computer
code concealed in superstring equations,

1927
01:54:50,120 --> 01:54:52,070
not just fucking ones and zeroes,

1928
01:54:52,071 --> 01:54:55,070
but what this guy calls
dual error correction code,

1929
01:54:55,071 --> 01:54:59,360
which is some form of weird fucking
shit that's already in our web browsers.

1930
01:54:59,361 --> 01:55:03,560
And based on the technology or the
invention of a programmer in the 1940s,

1931
01:55:03,980 --> 01:55:07,700
I mean, this is some lost shit
here. This is some La Shit,

1932
01:55:07,701 --> 01:55:09,800
but it's been dismissed, man. I mean,

1933
01:55:09,801 --> 01:55:13,250
I've been raving about it on my podcast
and some people like said that it's a

1934
01:55:13,251 --> 01:55:17,640
real fringy theory and you
know, who knows. But it started,

1935
01:55:19,220 --> 01:55:23,660
I thought it was a thought. It was um,
proven the, it's coming from a respected,

1936
01:55:23,860 --> 01:55:27,890
a theoretical physicist at
the University of Maryland.

1937
01:55:27,891 --> 01:55:31,220
I can't remember his name,
but it's definitely not like a Kook.

1938
01:55:31,490 --> 01:55:35,270
It's coming from a respected scientist
who has found this shit and he's a

1939
01:55:35,690 --> 01:55:40,040
equations. They're using the represents
supersymmetry and string theory,

1940
01:55:40,220 --> 01:55:45,180
string theory, these weird symbols. These
used to try to represent it. But yeah,

1941
01:55:45,181 --> 01:55:49,820
man, it's still like, it's a
pretty eerie thing, you know? Yeah.

1942
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:54,920
Tried to explain it to 'em
Neil degrasse Tyson in a video.

1943
01:55:55,850 --> 01:55:59,170
Yeah. And uh, it's, it's thoughts,

1944
01:55:59,250 --> 01:56:02,600
the whole premise of it is very hard
to wrap your head around. But this guy,

1945
01:56:02,960 --> 01:56:05,720
his name was doctor s James Gates Jr.
Yeah.

1946
01:56:06,050 --> 01:56:10,370
And he's a theoretical physicist and
with a crazy haircut. Yeah. Yeah.

1947
01:56:10,520 --> 01:56:15,520
The John s toll professor of physics
at the University of Maryland and the

1948
01:56:15,741 --> 01:56:20,660
director of the Center for string and
particle theory is reporting that certain

1949
01:56:20,661 --> 01:56:24,200
string theory,
super symmetrical equations,

1950
01:56:24,201 --> 01:56:28,790
which described the fundamental nature
of the universe and reality contain

1951
01:56:28,791 --> 01:56:30,560
embedded computer codes.

1952
01:56:30,980 --> 01:56:35,420
These codes are digital data in the
form of ones and Zeros. Not only that,

1953
01:56:35,990 --> 01:56:40,340
these codes are the same as what
makes web browsers work and our error

1954
01:56:40,341 --> 01:56:41,630
correction codes,

1955
01:56:42,080 --> 01:56:46,340
Gates says we have no idea what
these things are doing here.

1956
01:56:47,550 --> 01:56:50,010
Wow. So, so that's where it gets crazy.

1957
01:56:50,340 --> 01:56:54,730
Our first contact with a fucking alien
is going to be with the, uh, you know,

1958
01:56:54,750 --> 01:56:58,800
the programmer. But it gets, it gets
where it gets really weird. Joe,

1959
01:56:58,950 --> 01:57:01,890
here's where it gets really
fucking weird is the idea that

1960
01:57:03,510 --> 01:57:08,510
the city that we're running
in a simulation inside a
simulation and the same way

1961
01:57:08,611 --> 01:57:11,790
that we're trying to simulate reality
through video games, Sim city,

1962
01:57:11,791 --> 01:57:13,500
various fucking weather pattern,

1963
01:57:13,710 --> 01:57:17,400
supercomputers and all the various ways
we try to articulate reality through

1964
01:57:17,401 --> 01:57:18,234
machines.

1965
01:57:18,870 --> 01:57:23,730
This has already been done in a previous
machine that's articulating itself like

1966
01:57:23,731 --> 01:57:28,170
some kind of mirror flack refracting off
itself, infinitely going into itself,

1967
01:57:28,440 --> 01:57:31,020
always inventing itself again
and again and again. And again.

1968
01:57:31,100 --> 01:57:33,230
If that is the case,
what a trip it is.

1969
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:37,160
The idea of gang venting video
games while inside a simulation.

1970
01:57:37,260 --> 01:57:42,060
Yeah, but see this is where it gets cool
because maybe the simulation itself as a

1971
01:57:42,061 --> 01:57:44,640
novelty Generac generator,
maybe the simulation,

1972
01:57:44,641 --> 01:57:49,230
what it's here for is to generate, you
know, a novelty which is like, look man,

1973
01:57:49,260 --> 01:57:53,430
let's see what happens if we put an
entire planet full of people who quantum,

1974
01:57:53,431 --> 01:57:53,731
you know,

1975
01:57:53,731 --> 01:57:58,020
Nano bots have done neurological scans
of their brain to come do like kind of

1976
01:57:58,021 --> 01:58:02,100
like neurological thumbprints,
which we then animate within the machine.

1977
01:58:02,280 --> 01:58:05,910
Let's see what they do. I mean, what
we did was we invented some crazy shit.

1978
01:58:05,911 --> 01:58:08,580
Let's see if they invent some
new shit inside the simulator.

1979
01:58:08,940 --> 01:58:12,060
And all of a sudden the
simulators inventing new
technologies that are going up

1980
01:58:12,061 --> 01:58:13,650
through the God damn,
uh,

1981
01:58:13,710 --> 01:58:17,730
the different via levels of the machine
until finally it pops out and the

1982
01:58:17,731 --> 01:58:21,120
programmers desk and he's like,
oh, fucking awesome. Look at this.

1983
01:58:21,390 --> 01:58:23,250
One of these beings invented time travel.

1984
01:58:23,251 --> 01:58:26,640
Let's make a time machine and machine
invented time travel. Who knows?

1985
01:58:27,030 --> 01:58:30,570
But it's like a really great computer.
Like right now we put into like,

1986
01:58:30,720 --> 01:58:33,270
what's it called?
A Wolfram alpha.

1987
01:58:33,580 --> 01:58:37,380
You can throw in some pretty
awesome equations and I'll
spit out like you can do

1988
01:58:37,381 --> 01:58:38,460
a lot of crazy shit,

1989
01:58:38,850 --> 01:58:41,920
but how great would it be if you had
just a machine where you just seed it

1990
01:58:42,370 --> 01:58:46,840
with living beings and it
starts regurgitating inventions
that these beings are

1991
01:58:46,841 --> 01:58:50,290
creating? How fucking awesome
would that be? You know,

1992
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:53,800
you know what I've found the other day,
man, it's laying around here somewhere.

1993
01:58:54,160 --> 01:58:58,990
It's a, a camera on apple camera
from a long fucking time ago,

1994
01:58:58,991 --> 01:59:02,860
man. And it looks like such a
piece of shit now. It's so funny.

1995
01:59:03,010 --> 01:59:05,170
This was like one of the
first digital cameras.

1996
01:59:05,410 --> 01:59:10,270
It's like a dinosaur and it's only
for my tiny amount of years ago.

1997
01:59:11,270 --> 01:59:15,580
What is 15 years in the greater spectrum
of the university or just even of human

1998
01:59:15,581 --> 01:59:17,620
history. It ain't shit.
15 years ain't shit.

1999
01:59:17,860 --> 01:59:21,520
But this 15 year old camera was
fucking useless. Just useless.

2000
01:59:21,521 --> 01:59:23,480
Stupid looking cameras.
They always,

2001
01:59:23,950 --> 01:59:28,030
that's another component of
technological advancement is each um,

2002
01:59:28,990 --> 01:59:32,200
each earlier phase always
seems stupid stupid.

2003
01:59:32,201 --> 01:59:34,690
But when it comes out it seems awesome.
Awesome.

2004
01:59:36,520 --> 01:59:39,670
Well try driving like an old car.
You know,

2005
01:59:39,790 --> 01:59:44,230
old cars look great,
but if you try driving like a a 19,

2006
01:59:44,231 --> 01:59:48,940
69 Chevelle, the really hard to handle.
There's a lot of slack in the steering.

2007
01:59:49,090 --> 01:59:51,880
They're this crazy power
steering where it's really numb.

2008
01:59:52,060 --> 01:59:56,140
It feels real strange that they slide
all over the place. He hit the brakes,

2009
01:59:56,141 --> 02:00:00,140
they lock up and go sideways.
I mean, they're really
dangerous death traps. Yeah.

2010
02:00:00,250 --> 02:00:02,620
And then go from that to
what you drive that many.

2011
02:00:02,940 --> 02:00:07,030
The thing is like a little go karts
go karts. Bay Ship had there you,

2012
02:00:07,031 --> 02:00:08,250
it ain't no go card.
That's my,

2013
02:00:08,310 --> 02:00:13,250
I mean it's the way it's low to the ground
like that. That thing is, it's light.

2014
02:00:13,480 --> 02:00:17,860
And when you get a light car that has
like a really good drive train in a good

2015
02:00:17,861 --> 02:00:21,310
transmission and tight
steering, it's like, you know,

2016
02:00:21,490 --> 02:00:25,810
no that wasn't even on possible. What your
mini, you know, people would consider,

2017
02:00:25,811 --> 02:00:29,080
you know, a sporty like
sort of economy car. Yeah.

2018
02:00:29,110 --> 02:00:33,460
That was a race car just a few
decades ago. Dude, what about this?

2019
02:00:33,550 --> 02:00:34,960
If I take my fucking phone,

2020
02:00:34,961 --> 02:00:37,210
I guess you know that you've
been dealing with this for years,

2021
02:00:37,211 --> 02:00:40,690
but like I've been driving an 89 Volvo
that could barely get me to the fucking

2022
02:00:40,691 --> 02:00:43,360
grocery store for a very long time,
but to,

2023
02:00:43,370 --> 02:00:47,650
so for me being on the phone and then I
get into the mini Cooper and it goes in

2024
02:00:47,651 --> 02:00:51,490
the system. It's amazing.
That's crazy. It just does it,

2025
02:00:51,491 --> 02:00:56,020
it knows the phone just shifts into the
speakers of the car. That's insane, man.

2026
02:00:56,080 --> 02:00:57,850
It's incredible if you really
stop and think about it,

2027
02:00:57,851 --> 02:01:01,570
and if you think about the fact that
we're driving around like that, you know,

2028
02:01:01,690 --> 02:01:06,010
just talking in the air and it's
transmitted to someone else who's driving

2029
02:01:06,011 --> 02:01:06,970
around doing the same thing.

2030
02:01:06,971 --> 02:01:10,720
How about the fucking what the quantum
teleportation shit they're doing where

2031
02:01:10,721 --> 02:01:14,320
they're blasting photons across lakes.
So what the fuck is that?

2032
02:01:14,321 --> 02:01:18,460
And they're saying like the articles
that I've read and I didn't research them

2033
02:01:18,461 --> 02:01:21,670
deeply, but the articles I
read it, they're saying, well
this isn't teleportation,

2034
02:01:21,671 --> 02:01:25,210
but it's a nice step in that direction.
Like what did you just say?

2035
02:01:25,211 --> 02:01:28,330
You actually made a step in
the direction of teleportation.

2036
02:01:28,840 --> 02:01:32,680
Like think of the effect that has on
society. Teleport fucking station man.

2037
02:01:32,681 --> 02:01:35,920
Where like instead of having to go through
a security line at a god Damn airport,

2038
02:01:36,340 --> 02:01:40,940
you just Zap Zap from your home teleporter
to fucking Asia in a millisecond.

2039
02:01:41,270 --> 02:01:46,190
Where do you want to eat tonight? France
or China? I don't know. You decide.

2040
02:01:46,191 --> 02:01:47,810
You always make me fucking decide.

2041
02:01:48,020 --> 02:01:51,980
What about that nice little kaboshed
place in Egypt? Let's go there.

2042
02:01:52,280 --> 02:01:55,090
Now you're just deciding anywhere on
the planet that you want to go. Good.

2043
02:01:55,150 --> 02:01:58,440
More like people showing up and then
kicking you in the balls. What's a Kebab?

2044
02:01:59,250 --> 02:02:01,760
I don't know. What is it? Kaboshed I
just made it up. So it's that thing.

2045
02:02:01,761 --> 02:02:03,750
It's a stone food.
It's something,

2046
02:02:05,050 --> 02:02:09,840
it's a mythical stone stone or food.
The exist in mine. Simulator. A Cup.

2047
02:02:09,841 --> 02:02:11,930
Bosh never heard of it,
dude.

2048
02:02:12,290 --> 02:02:17,000
I think I wanted to say like something
between a Kabbalah and a squash or

2049
02:02:17,001 --> 02:02:21,940
something. I don't know. It's a
combination of the tree of life.

2050
02:02:21,950 --> 02:02:24,710
Mixed them with like buttered squash,
the Kabbalah.

2051
02:02:24,800 --> 02:02:28,280
The Kabbalah was like the thing that
like Roseanne was into for a while and

2052
02:02:28,430 --> 02:02:32,060
Madonna I believe was into it for
a while too, right? Well, yeah man.

2053
02:02:32,061 --> 02:02:36,140
And before them and it's been around much
longer than that. It's like, you know,

2054
02:02:36,141 --> 02:02:40,760
a Taro cards are based on it. It's a, it's
a crazy son of a bitch, man. It's just,

2055
02:02:40,761 --> 02:02:45,170
uh, it's trying to like map energy flows
from nothingness into somethingness and

2056
02:02:45,171 --> 02:02:49,610
it's a, a very strange esoteric
thing, which I don't understand.

2057
02:02:49,611 --> 02:02:52,530
I keep wanting to study it more when I,

2058
02:02:52,560 --> 02:02:56,150
when I got strep throat and was fucking
blasted on Cody and for five days I

2059
02:02:56,151 --> 02:03:01,151
spent a good two days just fucking
reading the Kabbalah and I had fucking and

2060
02:03:01,670 --> 02:03:04,940
Tarot cards and I was putting them on
the floor to try to understand the way

2061
02:03:04,941 --> 02:03:08,060
they connect to the Kabbalah. And, and I,

2062
02:03:08,420 --> 02:03:10,400
I don't remember anything
that I got out of that,

2063
02:03:10,401 --> 02:03:13,940
but it was like a little bit of
it because it's very complicated.

2064
02:03:14,090 --> 02:03:18,170
I keep like peep. Some people have emailed
me and said they understand it and um,

2065
02:03:18,410 --> 02:03:22,090
I think I might get Rosanna my podcast
and then I could ask her directly do that

2066
02:03:22,091 --> 02:03:26,000
would be incredible.
Roseanne Barr's a real fucking,

2067
02:03:26,460 --> 02:03:30,640
she was a real legend man.
She was a firebrand. Yeah.

2068
02:03:31,100 --> 02:03:35,120
I mean, isn't she trying to run for
president as was just too, yeah,

2069
02:03:35,121 --> 02:03:37,350
she's running for fucking
president, man. She's going forward.

2070
02:03:37,370 --> 02:03:40,790
It's a good way to get info out there,
you know? Wow. It gets, you know,

2071
02:03:40,791 --> 02:03:44,330
it gets some exposure and
she does not give a fuck.

2072
02:03:44,450 --> 02:03:47,330
I know what it's also a
fun thing, I'm sure. No,

2073
02:03:47,331 --> 02:03:48,890
but you can't really think
she's going to be president.

2074
02:03:48,891 --> 02:03:50,090
She doesn't think she's
going to be president,

2075
02:03:50,091 --> 02:03:52,490
but she's got like shit that she's
trying to get out into the world.

2076
02:03:52,490 --> 02:03:54,470
I mean if you follow her
fucking Twitter stream, man,

2077
02:03:54,471 --> 02:03:59,120
she blasts and crazy shit out there
and Ron Paul couldn't fucking make it

2078
02:03:59,121 --> 02:04:03,380
through. That was, that was
a disappointing one, man.
That was almost like, wow,

2079
02:04:03,381 --> 02:04:06,230
let's see. Maybe this
is real. This is real.

2080
02:04:07,090 --> 02:04:10,220
But there's like so much evidence with
them trying to suppress his victories.

2081
02:04:10,580 --> 02:04:14,150
If you want to go bliss. States
kept that shit on the routes. God,

2082
02:04:14,151 --> 02:04:17,240
we always fall for the trick. I
fought for every fucking year, man.

2083
02:04:17,241 --> 02:04:20,390
I thought every election I leave while
I'm certainly wanting to believe with

2084
02:04:20,391 --> 02:04:22,700
Obama,
I felt like he was the closest guy to us.

2085
02:04:22,730 --> 02:04:27,560
You know who's like in his forties
young guy, black guy is single mom,

2086
02:04:27,561 --> 02:04:30,300
you know the whole deal.
Like you figured this is a guy they would,

2087
02:04:30,440 --> 02:04:33,020
he's going to set us, right, dude,

2088
02:04:33,590 --> 02:04:38,590
I was on fucking sunset boulevard and
silver lake drunk howling at cars with a

2089
02:04:40,321 --> 02:04:44,670
group of hipsters when Obama got
elected. I was so fucking happy. I voted.

2090
02:04:45,090 --> 02:04:49,890
I voted for him. I fucking
man. I was like, this is it.

2091
02:04:49,891 --> 02:04:50,724
This is it.
And you know,

2092
02:04:51,210 --> 02:04:56,210
he has done some pretty not look before
I get as fucking assailed by a million

2093
02:04:57,151 --> 02:05:01,140
tweets about the fucking drone attacks
guys. I unders. I fucking understand.

2094
02:05:01,141 --> 02:05:04,260
I do know that the, the,
there's some fucking,

2095
02:05:04,261 --> 02:05:08,900
his DEA is busted more God
damn dispensary than George W.

2096
02:05:08,900 --> 02:05:13,350
Bush fucking DEA. You know, like there's
some fucked up shit going on, but he,

2097
02:05:13,351 --> 02:05:15,900
you know, there are some other
things that he's, you know,

2098
02:05:16,170 --> 02:05:18,360
he's big thing was the social thing to me.
It was like,

2099
02:05:18,361 --> 02:05:23,070
why don't we have accepted a guy who's
half black from a single mom, you know,

2100
02:05:23,100 --> 02:05:26,990
who admits he smoked marijuana, you
know, did he say he did a little cocoa?

2101
02:05:26,991 --> 02:05:28,140
But this is the problem.

2102
02:05:28,141 --> 02:05:33,141
He fucking jokes about smoking dope and
it's God Damn d A's tossing farmers in

2103
02:05:33,271 --> 02:05:35,520
prison. Yeah. And not only that, you know,

2104
02:05:35,521 --> 02:05:38,070
we're selling this hemp
force protein powder.

2105
02:05:38,190 --> 02:05:41,070
We can't even grow this hemp in America.

2106
02:05:41,071 --> 02:05:43,310
We have to get it from
Canada because although in,

2107
02:05:43,311 --> 02:05:45,390
and thank you for informing
me and all this folks,

2108
02:05:45,990 --> 02:05:49,200
people tweeted me that it
was legal in Vermont. So, uh,

2109
02:05:49,201 --> 02:05:50,890
we looked into it and it is,
but the,

2110
02:05:50,891 --> 02:05:53,160
the federal government is
not letting people do it.

2111
02:05:53,340 --> 02:05:57,000
They're still saying it's
illegal federally and this
is just growing the plant

2112
02:05:57,001 --> 02:06:01,770
hemp, which isn't psychoactive at all
because it's related to marijuana.

2113
02:06:01,771 --> 02:06:04,920
They've decided that there's no way
people should be able to grow it.

2114
02:06:05,930 --> 02:06:09,960
Just hilarious. So you can, you can have
it, but you've got to buy it from Canada.

2115
02:06:10,020 --> 02:06:14,330
So we have this wacky deal when you have
to import that shit, even though it's,

2116
02:06:14,430 --> 02:06:16,470
it's not even psychoactive,

2117
02:06:16,650 --> 02:06:21,120
they're just telling you that a useful
plant is illegal to, it's really weird.

2118
02:06:21,540 --> 02:06:22,021
I mean it's,

2119
02:06:22,021 --> 02:06:26,840
it's one of the weirdest aspects
of the drug war and you know, the,

2120
02:06:26,841 --> 02:06:30,330
the, the, the war for marijuana
legalization is the, the,

2121
02:06:30,630 --> 02:06:34,530
the actual like hemp,
hemp fiber,

2122
02:06:34,860 --> 02:06:39,210
they actually hemp as a, uh, as
a resource, you know? Oh yeah.

2123
02:06:39,211 --> 02:06:43,200
It was a commodity. Hemp as a
commodity is very, very valuable.

2124
02:06:43,500 --> 02:06:47,690
It's very valuable, yet illegal to
grow and harvest in this country.

2125
02:06:47,720 --> 02:06:51,230
I was just stunned by the colonies and
people don't have any idea that it's,

2126
02:06:51,350 --> 02:06:52,690
that's what rope used to be made up.

2127
02:06:52,740 --> 02:06:56,430
That's what canvas is made out of when
you paint. All is like ancient paintings.

2128
02:06:56,431 --> 02:07:00,840
Like, like the Mona Lisa, those are
made on cannabis. It's canvas. It's the,

2129
02:07:00,841 --> 02:07:05,490
it's the, it's comes from the word
cannabis because it's a stronger fiber.

2130
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:09,810
Cotton is weakest Shit and compared
to him like we get used to cotton,

2131
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:12,450
we're just, we just assumed that that's
just what it is. It is what it is.

2132
02:07:12,750 --> 02:07:17,460
But the cotton is nothing compared to
him. Hemp papers, better hand papers,

2133
02:07:17,461 --> 02:07:20,640
like really hard to ramp. It's like
fucking super strong. It's weird.

2134
02:07:21,120 --> 02:07:23,130
It's kind of like an alien plant man.

2135
02:07:23,610 --> 02:07:27,720
The stock is really light but it
gets real dense and hard. Dude,

2136
02:07:27,750 --> 02:07:29,970
don't get me going on the
fucking on that plant man.

2137
02:07:29,971 --> 02:07:34,971
Cause I guess it's insane when you get
around a nice flourishing marijuana.

2138
02:07:36,700 --> 02:07:41,320
You know like when you get around a
fucking monkey and it's like dog plus

2139
02:07:42,070 --> 02:07:43,180
marijuana plants.

2140
02:07:43,210 --> 02:07:47,290
Maybe I'm just projecting but they seem
like plants plus like they seem like is

2141
02:07:47,291 --> 02:07:49,420
a little bit more going
on in the sons of bitches.

2142
02:07:49,421 --> 02:07:53,010
They've got a weird fucking
energy field around him.

2143
02:07:53,011 --> 02:07:57,380
It's just different dispensers
grow room once and you,

2144
02:07:57,381 --> 02:07:58,710
you walk into their backroom,

2145
02:07:58,810 --> 02:08:03,760
they had a grow room and the grow room
was like Tingley and there's all these

2146
02:08:03,761 --> 02:08:08,080
plants that are like super healthy and
super moist. They're getting spray.

2147
02:08:08,081 --> 02:08:12,240
They have like a little spray thing.
It's timed soprano.

2148
02:08:12,270 --> 02:08:14,200
I'm certain times during
the day and they have,

2149
02:08:14,201 --> 02:08:17,320
they live under these lamps and you know
the lamps are on for a certain amount

2150
02:08:17,321 --> 02:08:20,470
of time off for a certain amount of time
and you watched it and it's like these

2151
02:08:20,471 --> 02:08:24,010
are like intelligent creatures. They feel
like they're, they're, they're feeling,

2152
02:08:24,080 --> 02:08:27,790
they're greeting you with their energy
and strange around one of the dentists

2153
02:08:27,791 --> 02:08:30,910
even creepier that you chop them
up. Like, what the fuck? Bad.

2154
02:08:31,240 --> 02:08:34,390
You don't even let them grow.
He grows and grows a certain point.

2155
02:08:34,391 --> 02:08:37,390
And then I'm like, all right,
time to dive edge. Yeah,

2156
02:08:37,860 --> 02:08:41,500
chop them and then you light them on
fire, dude. And that's the relationship.

2157
02:08:41,530 --> 02:08:44,980
It's the fucking fire sacrifice,
man. It's like this isn't, you know,

2158
02:08:44,981 --> 02:08:49,981
this is like an every single religion
there is a reference to burning incense.

2159
02:08:51,160 --> 02:08:55,570
There's Bush burning the burning Bush.
It's an everything dude.

2160
02:08:55,750 --> 02:08:59,800
And it's like the fact that the component
has been removed from the equation,

2161
02:09:00,190 --> 02:09:01,080
the variable,
it's,

2162
02:09:01,120 --> 02:09:03,850
they're trying to take the variable
out of the fucking equation.

2163
02:09:04,090 --> 02:09:07,480
It's like when I,
sometimes when you go to certain churches,

2164
02:09:08,260 --> 02:09:11,350
it's like a bunch of people. How many
churches are you going to? Oh Dude,

2165
02:09:11,351 --> 02:09:15,160
you gotta go to fucking churches from
time to time. He kidding. Fuck yeah, man,

2166
02:09:15,161 --> 02:09:19,420
there's so psychedelic and cool and
interesting phenomena. It's like I don't,

2167
02:09:19,421 --> 02:09:23,620
I mean, I will, I'll, I'll go
to a church over a zoo. Really?

2168
02:09:23,650 --> 02:09:25,870
I'll go to a church
over a laser light show.

2169
02:09:26,020 --> 02:09:28,090
So how often are you going to churches?
I've been,

2170
02:09:28,120 --> 02:09:32,470
I went on for a little tear of going to
a gnostic Christian Church because of

2171
02:09:32,471 --> 02:09:35,380
this book that I read.
Yeah, I would, yeah.

2172
02:09:35,390 --> 02:09:39,880
You eat some edible marijuana and go to
the GNOSTIC Christian Church to watch

2173
02:09:39,881 --> 02:09:43,030
the GNOSTIC mass,
which is this beautiful ancient ceremony,

2174
02:09:43,031 --> 02:09:47,560
which is like basically a, an,
it's an [inaudible]. It is.

2175
02:09:47,561 --> 02:09:48,730
It's an a cult ritual.

2176
02:09:48,731 --> 02:09:52,110
It's like you're doing something
called the transubstantiation,

2177
02:09:52,120 --> 02:09:55,810
which is transforming matter
into like the flesh of infinity.

2178
02:09:55,811 --> 02:09:59,050
But the gnostics don't look,
take things literally.

2179
02:09:59,350 --> 02:10:03,010
It's a different fucking thing all
together and it's quite beautiful.

2180
02:10:03,340 --> 02:10:07,240
I'm not a gnostic Christian, but
man, chomp on some fucking marijuana.

2181
02:10:07,380 --> 02:10:11,980
Go to a GNOSTIC Christian
Church respectfully. Don't
go there like some asshole.

2182
02:10:11,981 --> 02:10:14,950
Go there respectfully
and fucking report back.

2183
02:10:14,951 --> 02:10:19,930
You'll find that the experience is rather
moving and beautiful and it's um, uh,

2184
02:10:19,931 --> 02:10:24,931
when you can see how that component
and a religion is very important.

2185
02:10:24,941 --> 02:10:28,300
The psychedelic. See we do psychedelics
now, right? Generally we do.

2186
02:10:28,301 --> 02:10:30,040
Psychedelics would,
we don't have ceremony.

2187
02:10:30,340 --> 02:10:33,770
We have a kind of rudimentary ceremony,
the passing of the joint,

2188
02:10:33,920 --> 02:10:38,540
certain rules based around the, the,
the consumption of the substance.

2189
02:10:38,541 --> 02:10:41,660
But there's no real like ceremony
after that. I think some people do it,

2190
02:10:41,661 --> 02:10:44,810
but it's mostly you get high
and you watch them, you know,

2191
02:10:44,811 --> 02:10:48,420
you're hanging out with your
friends. Maybe you work out,
go jogging, draw. Right.

2192
02:10:48,500 --> 02:10:51,380
There's like rudimentary, low
levels, their monies. But no,

2193
02:10:51,381 --> 02:10:55,040
like chanting candles,
incense.

2194
02:10:55,540 --> 02:10:58,320
What's the benefit of
the, of the, uh, ceremony?

2195
02:10:59,590 --> 02:11:04,450
Well, one, one thing that, the
first thing to remove from, uh,

2196
02:11:05,020 --> 02:11:08,230
when it comes to like spiritual
staff is the term is benefit.

2197
02:11:09,010 --> 02:11:10,620
You know what I mean?
Because it's like, it's,

2198
02:11:10,621 --> 02:11:14,140
it's a weird thing that plays against
a lot of the way we understand shit is

2199
02:11:14,141 --> 02:11:14,890
it's like, no, there isn't.

2200
02:11:14,890 --> 02:11:18,700
It's not like you're not going for
it for like so much a benefit though.

2201
02:11:18,701 --> 02:11:21,940
It is entertaining and you are getting
some instant kind of benefit from like,

2202
02:11:21,941 --> 02:11:24,600
just like being in a beautiful space,
listening.

2203
02:11:24,620 --> 02:11:26,590
People chant when you're super baked.

2204
02:11:26,800 --> 02:11:30,430
There's some immediate benefit
that comes from that. But the, um,

2205
02:11:31,570 --> 02:11:35,650
I think there's a lot of, I mean, the,
the, the, the, it's a deep, it's, for me,

2206
02:11:35,651 --> 02:11:37,090
the experience was like,

2207
02:11:37,630 --> 02:11:42,630
this is a very old thing that
I don't understand that well,

2208
02:11:44,620 --> 02:11:49,180
and the energy in here is fucking cool.
That was it.

2209
02:11:49,181 --> 02:11:53,950
The first, that was the first thing
that came out of it. And then, um, I,

2210
02:11:53,951 --> 02:11:58,951
the priests made a joke
about marijuana actually.

2211
02:11:59,021 --> 02:12:01,960
It was, it was like, really? Yeah,
when he was talking, I can't remember,

2212
02:12:01,961 --> 02:12:04,240
but I remember being like,
Whoa, fucking crazy man,

2213
02:12:04,241 --> 02:12:08,110
because I just been reading in this book,
um,

2214
02:12:08,140 --> 02:12:13,120
magic marijuana in religion that like
cannabis was ritualistically consumed and

2215
02:12:13,121 --> 02:12:17,740
Nasik ceremonies. And so it was
like kind of weird and interesting.

2216
02:12:18,040 --> 02:12:21,040
Anyway, man, it's, it's a,
it's a beautiful fucking thing.

2217
02:12:21,250 --> 02:12:26,250
But when you see rituals that don't
have psychoactive components in them,

2218
02:12:27,100 --> 02:12:31,660
sometimes it feels like you're watching
people warming their hands on dry tender

2219
02:12:31,661 --> 02:12:35,290
that hasn't been set alight and pretending
that there's fire coming up out of it,

2220
02:12:35,291 --> 02:12:39,700
you know, it's like you, you room to
remove the psychedelic from ritual.

2221
02:12:39,701 --> 02:12:42,580
When we see in like so many
indigenous cultures, the,

2222
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:46,210
it's a component of their
spirituality and their religion.

2223
02:12:46,480 --> 02:12:48,230
It's kind of interesting.
Yeah.

2224
02:12:48,360 --> 02:12:52,620
Yeah. It was a, a very important
aspect of the growth, you know,

2225
02:12:52,621 --> 02:12:56,670
a very important aspect of the,
you know, the, the ceremony itself,

2226
02:12:56,700 --> 02:13:00,630
the transcending to the next stage, the
going through the experience, the trip,

2227
02:13:00,900 --> 02:13:05,700
you know, to having the vision quest,
you know, the, the, the payoti ritual,

2228
02:13:05,701 --> 02:13:09,630
whether it was the Iowasca ritual, whether
it was mushrooms and, and you know,

2229
02:13:09,910 --> 02:13:13,020
in South America and Mexico,
whatever, whatever it was,

2230
02:13:13,380 --> 02:13:17,400
it was all about a transformative
experience. It was all about, you know,

2231
02:13:17,520 --> 02:13:22,470
getting closer to Gaia, getting closer to
the energy of the, the, the true energy,

2232
02:13:22,500 --> 02:13:27,360
which we all get off, man. It's,
society is very complicated. You know,

2233
02:13:27,570 --> 02:13:31,530
there are social interactions
are so overbearing, the, that

2234
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:35,850
there's 300 million of us jammed onto
this spot interacting with each other all

2235
02:13:35,851 --> 02:13:39,630
the time. And it's, it's, it's
hard to, it's hard to stay steady.

2236
02:13:39,780 --> 02:13:41,850
It's hard to stay on track,
not freak out,

2237
02:13:42,720 --> 02:13:45,250
but then this comedy and
freaking out tills problem too.

2238
02:13:45,890 --> 02:13:48,480
The more you freak out and get
pissed and things, the funnier it is.

2239
02:13:48,980 --> 02:13:50,840
Yeah.
And you got to let yourself freak too.

2240
02:13:50,841 --> 02:13:52,850
I mean that's another
thing is like people,

2241
02:13:53,030 --> 02:13:56,210
this fucking thing where people are
all about being happy all the time.

2242
02:13:56,211 --> 02:13:59,540
People have confused, um, you know,

2243
02:13:59,960 --> 02:14:03,260
happiness is the end goal.
Like having this emotional state of just,

2244
02:14:03,261 --> 02:14:05,810
I'm happy today.
Like that's not it.

2245
02:14:05,811 --> 02:14:10,010
Ideas being you're fully yourself
and the entire spectrum of emotional

2246
02:14:10,011 --> 02:14:11,210
experience,
you know what I mean?

2247
02:14:11,420 --> 02:14:15,680
And it's like to in part of the emotional
experience of existing is to having

2248
02:14:15,681 --> 02:14:17,060
meltdowns from time to time.

2249
02:14:17,061 --> 02:14:19,700
Like it's good to have a nice
meltdown from time to time.

2250
02:14:19,701 --> 02:14:21,920
It's good to like freak from,

2251
02:14:21,921 --> 02:14:25,790
don't beat yourself up for fucking losing
your shit, right? It's going to happen.

2252
02:14:25,791 --> 02:14:27,050
Why wouldn't you lose your shit?

2253
02:14:27,200 --> 02:14:31,430
You're in a goddamn simulator with
fucking dual error correcting code at the

2254
02:14:31,431 --> 02:14:34,310
fundamental layer of the universe. And
the thing is more than likely complete.

2255
02:14:34,400 --> 02:14:37,880
We're too stupid to really understand
that more than likely a telescoping

2256
02:14:37,881 --> 02:14:42,881
simulation where each
incremental telescoping moving
out becomes more and more

2257
02:14:43,041 --> 02:14:47,300
in tropic and out of focus.
And we're somewhere in this like middle,

2258
02:14:47,301 --> 02:14:52,301
mid range of this telescoping simulator
that keeps getting washed out more and

2259
02:14:52,371 --> 02:14:53,001
more and more.

2260
02:14:53,001 --> 02:14:57,110
This is the principle in physics of the
universe expanding and running out of

2261
02:14:57,111 --> 02:14:59,870
energy or the ID and Hinduism of Kali.

2262
02:14:59,871 --> 02:15:04,640
You get the final age of human beings are
the Mayan calendar and all the various

2263
02:15:04,641 --> 02:15:06,800
per uh, uh, um,

2264
02:15:07,160 --> 02:15:10,760
eschatological prophecies talking
about the end of the world.

2265
02:15:10,761 --> 02:15:12,800
The fucking simulators
going to run out of juice.

2266
02:15:12,801 --> 02:15:16,130
Someone's getting get called the dinner
and have to stop playing the fucking

2267
02:15:16,131 --> 02:15:18,290
game or go out or

2268
02:15:18,930 --> 02:15:21,380
Aloma country.
Hello God,

2269
02:15:22,040 --> 02:15:26,690
I love of guns and anybody wants to change
that. You've got to come through me.

2270
02:15:26,750 --> 02:15:29,870
I got to come through me.
I love my simulator.

2271
02:15:30,110 --> 02:15:34,760
I love the programmer and anybody who
wants to fuck with the operating system is

2272
02:15:34,761 --> 02:15:37,740
going to have to go through my firewall.
I love the engineer.

2273
02:15:37,741 --> 02:15:41,840
I took the blue pill. Yeah, right. Well
then you know, those guys are nuts.

2274
02:15:41,841 --> 02:15:46,550
They don't one of those fucking guys get a
section. Yeah. Well, you know, the whole,

2275
02:15:46,551 --> 02:15:48,830
uh, controversy behind the
script, there was a woman,

2276
02:15:48,831 --> 02:15:53,440
a claim that she had written that and
given it to them like years before,

2277
02:15:53,540 --> 02:15:56,840
and they took the idea and made
it a movie. But I think she lost,

2278
02:15:56,841 --> 02:15:57,950
I think she lost in court.

2279
02:15:58,910 --> 02:16:02,810
It's gotta be hard to try to get money
out of the matrix, even if it's true.

2280
02:16:02,870 --> 02:16:06,890
It's fucking so much money behind
that does that machine. But yeah,

2281
02:16:06,891 --> 02:16:08,930
she sued she,
I don't know if she's crazy.

2282
02:16:08,931 --> 02:16:12,260
I shouldn't even be bringing it up because
you never really know. Like sometimes,

2283
02:16:12,350 --> 02:16:15,170
sometimes people steal ideas,
but sometimes people are kind of crazy.

2284
02:16:15,680 --> 02:16:20,220
And also the idea of the matrix, it sounds
like an age old idea. It's like, yeah,

2285
02:16:20,240 --> 02:16:23,240
but I think the similarities were
very extreme. Oh really? Yeah.

2286
02:16:23,241 --> 02:16:27,990
I'm talking out my ass. Let, let me pull
it up real quick. Hey trick. So awesome.

2287
02:16:28,370 --> 02:16:30,130
What a great movie, man. There's so much

2288
02:16:30,130 --> 02:16:33,910
information and coded and that
son of a bitch SQLs are terrible.

2289
02:16:34,840 --> 02:16:39,250
I don't remember the
sequels, you know? No Man,

2290
02:16:39,251 --> 02:16:40,300
I really don't.
I remember that

2291
02:16:40,420 --> 02:16:43,270
first. Honestly, they gave them
the reins to somebody else.

2292
02:16:44,950 --> 02:16:49,060
Snopes. There's a Snopes,
which means it's a problem,

2293
02:16:50,200 --> 02:16:54,610
right? Isn't it usually what
is, nope. Yeah. When Snopes,

2294
02:16:54,611 --> 02:16:58,600
it's like they're clearing up a myth
isn't an almost all Snopes climbing up

2295
02:16:58,620 --> 02:17:00,570
myths. Yeah. This is a,

2296
02:17:00,580 --> 02:17:04,780
it says the claim is that she want a
large judgment in a copyright infringement

2297
02:17:04,781 --> 02:17:08,110
suit over the other ship that film
the Matrix. That is false apparently.

2298
02:17:08,680 --> 02:17:13,000
And she started in okay in October 4th,

2299
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:16,300
2004 ended a six year dispute
involving Sophia Stewart.

2300
02:17:16,360 --> 02:17:19,450
And so for six fucking years of
dragged on copyright infringement,

2301
02:17:19,451 --> 02:17:23,080
racketeering received and acknowledged
by the center, um, central district,

2302
02:17:23,081 --> 02:17:24,550
California, blah, blah, blah, blah,

2303
02:17:24,551 --> 02:17:28,210
Blah Stewart who has resided in Salt
Lake City for the past five years.

2304
02:17:28,390 --> 02:17:30,940
We'll recover damages from the films.
Wait a minute.

2305
02:17:31,740 --> 02:17:34,150
She will cover damages to Matrix one,

2306
02:17:34,151 --> 02:17:37,510
two and three as well as the
terminator and SQL as Holy Shit.

2307
02:17:37,930 --> 02:17:41,410
She will soon receive one of the biggest
payoffs in the history of Hollywood as

2308
02:17:41,411 --> 02:17:46,000
well as gross receipts of both films and
they're sequels to total of two point

2309
02:17:46,001 --> 02:17:50,020
$5 billion. Steward for what? I thought
it just said, it wasn't route. Yeah,

2310
02:17:50,021 --> 02:17:53,800
I got confused. I thought they were
explaining it. Oh, this is examples.

2311
02:17:53,801 --> 02:17:57,700
This is examples of the
various lies. Oh, I see. Okay.

2312
02:17:58,330 --> 02:18:00,220
Two point $5 billion.

2313
02:18:00,940 --> 02:18:05,260
Apparently she generated controversy by
claiming in a lawsuit brought against

2314
02:18:05,261 --> 02:18:07,870
directors, Andy and Larry,
which one became a chick.

2315
02:18:07,970 --> 02:18:10,110
Okay. When can I ask you something? Holla.

2316
02:18:10,140 --> 02:18:15,140
When you deposit a huge amount of money
into a bank and deal your bank account,

2317
02:18:16,050 --> 02:18:17,610
how long does it take to go through?

2318
02:18:17,611 --> 02:18:20,340
Like if you deposited like
$1 million in your bank?

2319
02:18:20,570 --> 02:18:24,440
I don't know. Listen to this.
Stewart's case was dismissed in June,

2320
02:18:24,440 --> 02:18:28,460
2005 when she failed to show up for a
preliminary hearing of her case and a 53

2321
02:18:28,461 --> 02:18:31,820
page ruling judge Margaret Morrow,
the Central District Court of California,

2322
02:18:31,821 --> 02:18:35,900
dismissed the suit saying Stuart and her
attorneys had not entered any evidence

2323
02:18:35,901 --> 02:18:39,920
to bolster its key claims or demonstrated
any striking similarity between her

2324
02:18:39,921 --> 02:18:43,580
work and she didn't show up. That's
crazy. Well, Amanda, what that is,

2325
02:18:43,830 --> 02:18:46,490
you think they paid her?
They pulled her son Cillizza bench.

2326
02:18:48,160 --> 02:18:52,390
I don't know. I'm maybe why there? Why
not? They've got a shitload of money.

2327
02:18:52,391 --> 02:18:56,710
Who knows? I don't know. Probably not.
Wonder One. How close it was close.

2328
02:18:56,711 --> 02:18:59,860
The case was, I mean, she's
a who knows, man, you can do,

2329
02:18:59,861 --> 02:19:03,970
you can take anyone to court. You know,
like you can file suit against people,

2330
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:05,410
right.
I mean,

2331
02:19:05,411 --> 02:19:08,680
people when I worked at the comedy
store have filed suit against Mitzi for

2332
02:19:08,681 --> 02:19:13,500
sending negative telepathic vibes
into their thoughts. For reals.

2333
02:19:13,570 --> 02:19:18,040
Yeah. Quitting to go to court for that.
Kooks look up the parking meter lady.

2334
02:19:18,041 --> 02:19:20,560
There's someone suing the city
for their new parking meters.

2335
02:19:20,561 --> 02:19:23,260
You can Google search it.
It's like all over the news right now.

2336
02:19:23,261 --> 02:19:26,110
It freaked her out.
So some people just like lawsuits,

2337
02:19:27,030 --> 02:19:27,990
they just get really good at it.

2338
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:32,480
It's like a hobby.
Just fuck with the system.

2339
02:19:32,880 --> 02:19:34,370
Trying to drag things through.
Well,

2340
02:19:34,371 --> 02:19:36,140
I mean of course some
people make a lot of money,

2341
02:19:36,141 --> 02:19:41,141
like some people will actually track
down ladies nights and sue the fucking

2342
02:19:41,151 --> 02:19:44,300
companies cause they can't get in.
Yeah, yeah. That's hilarious. Yeah,

2343
02:19:44,330 --> 02:19:46,850
that's like a way that's some
people's bread and butter.

2344
02:19:47,200 --> 02:19:52,200
This is that people will find places that
aren't like equipped for handy if for

2345
02:19:53,011 --> 02:19:56,520
uh, for people in wheelchairs and
they'll fucking sewer man. And you know,

2346
02:19:56,521 --> 02:19:57,201
in that way,

2347
02:19:57,201 --> 02:20:01,400
I am very much a feminist and I think
women should be allowed to have their own

2348
02:20:01,401 --> 02:20:04,550
fucking gym and I don't think you
should be allowed to protest that.

2349
02:20:04,580 --> 02:20:09,110
I think if women want to work on a gym,
would no drooling. Fucking ape dudes,

2350
02:20:09,350 --> 02:20:12,410
any guy who tried to go
to the gym is an asshole.

2351
02:20:12,530 --> 02:20:16,760
If you want to go to a gym that's just
completely filled with women who don't

2352
02:20:16,761 --> 02:20:19,550
want to be around men, they know the
deal. That's what they agreed to.

2353
02:20:19,760 --> 02:20:22,850
And you want to claim that your rights
are being violated because this gym is

2354
02:20:22,851 --> 02:20:27,470
closest to you, so you just, by proximity
you should be allowed to use it.

2355
02:20:27,500 --> 02:20:29,510
Like they shouldn't be.
What? Ridiculousness.

2356
02:20:29,511 --> 02:20:32,360
That you shouldn't be allowed to limit
your business to only include one gender

2357
02:20:32,361 --> 02:20:35,180
because the other gender is always
trying to fuck that single gender.

2358
02:20:35,760 --> 02:20:38,510
They'll always make an uncomfortable
and feel weird when they're fucking

2359
02:20:38,511 --> 02:20:42,260
stretching out. Yeah, that is fun.
It's fucking gross. It's gross.

2360
02:20:42,261 --> 02:20:45,020
It's gross than any asphalt would
actually try to sue them for that,

2361
02:20:45,310 --> 02:20:49,640
but that you would want to go but, but
you know, but that's weird because like,

2362
02:20:49,641 --> 02:20:53,890
you know, women's bathrooms are like
sovereign nations for women and men.

2363
02:20:54,080 --> 02:20:57,530
A man can't sue to be allowed to go into
a women's bathroom or a woman can't sue

2364
02:20:57,531 --> 02:21:02,420
to be in a man's man
can sue if there's not a woman's bathroom.

2365
02:21:02,780 --> 02:21:05,780
If you go to a place and there's only
a man's bathroom, you could too, right?

2366
02:21:05,810 --> 02:21:07,510
You have to have both. Yeah,
you have to have balls.

2367
02:21:07,511 --> 02:21:10,970
So they would have to build a gym if
they built a gym next to that, Jen,

2368
02:21:11,060 --> 02:21:15,710
all men and one would be empty
and one will be filled with women.

2369
02:21:16,600 --> 02:21:19,880
Well, all men, Jim gets
filled with gay guys. Oh yeah,

2370
02:21:19,881 --> 02:21:23,660
I forgot about that Gold's gym.
Dumb joke. I forgot about that. I,

2371
02:21:23,830 --> 02:21:25,640
when I first was on news radio,

2372
02:21:25,700 --> 02:21:30,260
I'd work out there and I had this whole
bit about it doing a bench press and

2373
02:21:30,261 --> 02:21:32,630
dudes would just like spot
you wouldn't even ask.

2374
02:21:32,870 --> 02:21:35,420
They would just literally just dangle
their balls right above your head.

2375
02:21:35,421 --> 02:21:36,800
They were like so cocky,

2376
02:21:37,130 --> 02:21:40,460
like dudes were like hitting on
dudes left and right in this jam.

2377
02:21:40,461 --> 02:21:45,220
It was crazy because that's what they
were there for. I watched these guys just,

2378
02:21:45,250 --> 02:21:49,250
just fucking grunting through a
set. There were uh, doing, um,

2379
02:21:49,280 --> 02:21:51,110
the guy was doing rose,
you know,

2380
02:21:51,111 --> 02:21:54,680
so he's like bent over and the other guy,

2381
02:21:54,890 --> 02:21:58,310
his chest to back. Okay.
Pressing down on him.

2382
02:21:58,490 --> 02:22:00,860
And the way he's spotting him is,
you know,

2383
02:22:00,861 --> 02:22:04,790
the guy is holding onto the bar and
he's holding onto the top of the bar,

2384
02:22:05,060 --> 02:22:08,840
chest to back and it's like he's
fucking a man. I mean, it's like,

2385
02:22:08,841 --> 02:22:13,640
it's really physical. Like if I
was doing that, I would, you know,

2386
02:22:13,641 --> 02:22:16,440
if it was a check, if I was doing
that to my wife, I'd get a tech.

2387
02:22:16,790 --> 02:22:20,120
My Dick would get hard. If you were,
we're helping our pull and push like that,

2388
02:22:20,330 --> 02:22:22,970
he would start just put this fucking
laid down. What's up? You know,

2389
02:22:22,971 --> 02:22:26,310
you would immediately want to fuck.
Well now mean it's a fucking motion.

2390
02:22:26,310 --> 02:22:30,780
And these guys were doing that in
the gym. No, it's funny how like them

2391
02:22:31,550 --> 02:22:35,180
funny how the mythical,
the mythical world of porn,

2392
02:22:35,420 --> 02:22:37,250
like an egg is in the porn universe.

2393
02:22:37,251 --> 02:22:41,030
The physics of porn or not the
physics of the material world,

2394
02:22:41,031 --> 02:22:44,750
the physics of porn. That shit
happens, dude. You're at the gym.

2395
02:22:44,751 --> 02:22:48,710
And some chicks like, Hey, can you spot
me for a second? And you're like, sure,

2396
02:22:48,711 --> 02:22:52,670
I'll by you. And then like,
just, she's just starts
sucking your Dick. You're like,

2397
02:22:52,671 --> 02:22:57,000
wow, I can't pull that. Guess
I owe you one zip. Yeah, yeah.

2398
02:22:57,320 --> 02:22:59,060
That's the physics of porn.

2399
02:22:59,120 --> 02:23:01,790
And then another dude will come over
and just start jacking off and stick it

2400
02:23:01,791 --> 02:23:04,260
into her while she's sucking your day.
You don't care. You're like, hey, yeah,

2401
02:23:04,261 --> 02:23:08,920
what's up? Let's run a train on
this bitch porn physics. But in,

2402
02:23:09,380 --> 02:23:11,630
but it's weird how like in like,
you know,

2403
02:23:11,631 --> 02:23:15,750
like places like what you're talking
about, which, uh, I had this guy, uh,

2404
02:23:16,190 --> 02:23:18,620
very fucking brilliant guy,

2405
02:23:18,621 --> 02:23:23,420
Conner Habib who also happens to
be a gay porn star on my podcast.

2406
02:23:23,421 --> 02:23:25,080
And he was talking about fucking,
um,

2407
02:23:25,120 --> 02:23:30,080
you are your own actually a great essay
on cruising. Uh, and, and, and uh,

2408
02:23:30,230 --> 02:23:34,550
which will permanently shift your
notion of rest areas permanently.

2409
02:23:35,270 --> 02:23:39,020
But like, you know, he calls those
types of gems that you're talking about.

2410
02:23:39,021 --> 02:23:43,160
I think the term you used was
cruisy is the word of it. So, yeah.

2411
02:23:43,161 --> 02:23:47,420
So like those places, the physics in
there are the same as inside porn.

2412
02:23:47,870 --> 02:23:51,560
If you're a gay dude, you can
go to a gym. And like, fuck,

2413
02:23:51,920 --> 02:23:52,910
you're going to fuck.

2414
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,730
Yeah, it's a completely different
experience because just knowing Yang,

2415
02:23:56,060 --> 02:23:58,480
it's all just everybody's
just, or news. No Yin,

2416
02:23:58,490 --> 02:24:02,990
I don't know which one is the hard
style, but it's just, just fucking it up.

2417
02:24:03,020 --> 02:24:05,090
That's it. They just,
they're just looking to fuck

2418
02:24:05,220 --> 02:24:09,510
one thing I've never thought on my way
to the gym as I'm probably going to get

2419
02:24:09,511 --> 02:24:13,500
laid in here. Never
thought that. I'm like, Oh,

2420
02:24:13,501 --> 02:24:14,630
I think I'm going to be a fucking party.

2421
02:24:14,640 --> 02:24:17,610
Get a blow job after my fucking a squats.

2422
02:24:18,540 --> 02:24:21,180
I told you when Bravo and I
used to work out at this gym,

2423
02:24:21,210 --> 02:24:25,290
we used to work out at um, 24 hour
fitness and uh, when we would go there,

2424
02:24:25,291 --> 02:24:27,510
there was a dude that we got friendly
with. It was the manager guy,

2425
02:24:27,540 --> 02:24:32,540
real friendly guy and he
had just transferred over
from Santa Monica and he was

2426
02:24:33,181 --> 02:24:37,320
just so happy. He was so relaxed to be
in like the suburbs. And I go, well,

2427
02:24:37,321 --> 02:24:38,300
what's going on? He goes, I,

2428
02:24:38,370 --> 02:24:41,400
I was brought in there to clean it up
and he was brought in there because they

2429
02:24:41,401 --> 02:24:45,150
were just fucking everywhere.
They had just turned it into a gay gym.

2430
02:24:45,420 --> 02:24:48,870
It was just not just a gay gym, but it
was like, it was a gay pickup joint.

2431
02:24:48,871 --> 02:24:52,080
It was a, it was a disco so they
would a steam room, they'd fucking,

2432
02:24:52,130 --> 02:24:52,963
the steam room.

2433
02:24:53,010 --> 02:24:55,670
People would constantly be walking
in on guys fucking in the steam room.

2434
02:24:55,680 --> 02:24:58,080
They'd find loads all over the benches.
Shit,

2435
02:24:58,440 --> 02:25:00,000
he'd have to come in and
hose everything down.

2436
02:25:00,090 --> 02:25:03,300
So they had to like literally like
clean up the whole place and tell them

2437
02:25:03,301 --> 02:25:07,010
they've got to stop fucking and people
get mad at them. Like, what do I do?

2438
02:25:07,011 --> 02:25:10,590
You think there was like one guy who was
like straight and just annoyed all the

2439
02:25:10,591 --> 02:25:12,750
time cause he was always
sitting in ges and like,

2440
02:25:13,330 --> 02:25:15,090
I just want to fucking work out dude.

2441
02:25:15,270 --> 02:25:17,400
I'm sure there must've been
some straight guys there.

2442
02:25:17,580 --> 02:25:19,980
I though I was straight when
I worked out at Gold's gym.

2443
02:25:20,010 --> 02:25:24,130
I was straight guy back and
when I started, before I went

2444
02:25:24,130 --> 02:25:28,780
queer I was straight
and I was there and uh,

2445
02:25:28,781 --> 02:25:31,060
so the guys I worked with were,
were straight and they were there.

2446
02:25:31,090 --> 02:25:35,050
It was a convenient Jim, it wasn't
all gay, but it was at least 50%,

2447
02:25:35,080 --> 02:25:39,520
maybe more gay. And they were really
like, they owned it, they owned it.

2448
02:25:39,521 --> 02:25:41,440
They owned being gay.
They owned that place.

2449
02:25:41,620 --> 02:25:44,050
They would wear like timberland
boots with like fluffy,

2450
02:25:44,051 --> 02:25:48,970
puffy socks and like shaved legs,
very muscular legs with ready,

2451
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,690
ready, ready? Daisy Duke shorts. Yeah.

2452
02:25:51,940 --> 02:25:54,160
And guys would work out like
that with a tank top on.

2453
02:25:54,161 --> 02:25:56,830
They were gay as fuck dude
at the fucking Gold's gym.

2454
02:25:56,831 --> 02:25:59,850
I used to work out at Gold's
gym and Hollywood and cold.

2455
02:25:59,851 --> 02:26:04,120
That's what I'm talking about.
Gold's on coal. Ah, yeah dude.

2456
02:26:04,121 --> 02:26:07,450
There was a guy in chaps,
fucking black,

2457
02:26:07,600 --> 02:26:10,900
a black leather chaps.
Like he was like,

2458
02:26:10,901 --> 02:26:14,830
just wandered off of a
fucking I ranch filled with,

2459
02:26:16,250 --> 02:26:18,460
but it's their spot man.
You know,

2460
02:26:18,461 --> 02:26:23,290
like good for them that I've never
understood anti gay feelings.

2461
02:26:23,500 --> 02:26:25,720
They seem like they're having a fun time.
I know,

2462
02:26:25,721 --> 02:26:29,860
I know a lot of gay people and I, I, it
seems like they're having a good time.

2463
02:26:30,400 --> 02:26:33,410
They've got a lot of exposable
disposable income, you know,

2464
02:26:33,790 --> 02:26:37,110
I know this gay couple, they're always
driving a new car. I feel like there,

2465
02:26:37,120 --> 02:26:39,190
what a great thought.
Yeah man. And yeah, no,

2466
02:26:39,191 --> 02:26:43,120
I though these fucking homophobes he's
so stupid box right now are really like

2467
02:26:43,150 --> 02:26:45,760
really? But it's cool man
because like what's happening,

2468
02:26:45,761 --> 02:26:47,740
what's really cool and fascinating,

2469
02:26:47,741 --> 02:26:51,670
it's like the bigots are the ones who
were being driven into the closet.

2470
02:26:51,700 --> 02:26:52,870
It used to be that like,

2471
02:26:53,130 --> 02:26:57,310
it's like reversing like gay people are
coming out of the closet and bigots are

2472
02:26:57,311 --> 02:27:01,410
getting pushed into the closet that they
came out of, which is great fucking,

2473
02:27:01,810 --> 02:27:03,790
that's a good balance.
That's what it should be like.

2474
02:27:03,980 --> 02:27:08,440
I've always said that, that, that's my
take on everything. That as, as, as a,

2475
02:27:08,441 --> 02:27:12,250
as a human being that I should be
a humanist, you know, and I should,

2476
02:27:12,251 --> 02:27:16,120
it shouldn't matter whether I'm with the
straights or with the gays or the white

2477
02:27:16,121 --> 02:27:19,420
to the block.
We should all just be with the humans.

2478
02:27:19,450 --> 02:27:24,450
And I resisted any ideas of
being a masculinist or any
ideas of being a feminist

2479
02:27:25,301 --> 02:27:30,301
or any ideas of being a nationalist or
any ideas of being a peacenik or more ma

2480
02:27:31,210 --> 02:27:35,500
stop it. He's just like, this is
ridiculous. You're a fucking human.

2481
02:27:35,680 --> 02:27:38,200
We're all human and it
should be real simple.

2482
02:27:38,290 --> 02:27:41,710
We should get in each other's
way as little as possible.

2483
02:27:41,830 --> 02:27:45,370
Help each other out as much as possible.
It's really that simple.

2484
02:27:45,430 --> 02:27:48,760
It's very simple. It's really that
simple. And anything else, it's crazy.

2485
02:27:48,880 --> 02:27:49,870
And that's why,
you know,

2486
02:27:50,210 --> 02:27:54,880
if people got really upset about this
whole tosh thing and people got upset at

2487
02:27:54,881 --> 02:27:57,250
the backlash,
but what I think,

2488
02:27:57,570 --> 02:28:01,930
we can't ever pretend that
intent is not important.

2489
02:28:02,060 --> 02:28:05,530
What can ever pretend that there are
buzzwords that you can never use or

2490
02:28:05,531 --> 02:28:09,490
subjects which you can
never cover or you know, or,

2491
02:28:09,510 --> 02:28:12,700
or you're not allowed to because
someone could have possibly had a bad

2492
02:28:12,701 --> 02:28:16,960
experience. You're going to trigger an
event that's not comedy, man. You, you,

2493
02:28:16,961 --> 02:28:20,490
you can't have those sort of restrictions
and have standup comedy. You're,

2494
02:28:20,590 --> 02:28:21,800
it's not going to work that way.

2495
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:22,890
You're going to miss out

2496
02:28:22,940 --> 02:28:25,430
on a lot of great comedy.
Dude.

2497
02:28:25,460 --> 02:28:27,710
You can't have those fucking
restrictions on anything.

2498
02:28:27,711 --> 02:28:30,380
You can't have it on literature.
You can't have it on poetry.

2499
02:28:30,381 --> 02:28:31,214
You can't have it on.

2500
02:28:31,710 --> 02:28:33,450
People want to restrict people.

2501
02:28:33,690 --> 02:28:37,980
Why do these smart people want to come
down on it so hard when they know what is

2502
02:28:37,981 --> 02:28:38,680
really going on?

2503
02:28:38,680 --> 02:28:41,740
Well, it's a, I think there's a bunch
of different answers that question.

2504
02:28:41,800 --> 02:28:45,700
I think there's a variety
of reasons people want to do
it from the, uh, from like,

2505
02:28:45,701 --> 02:28:48,540
I suppose like people who
are like Crusaders and,

2506
02:28:48,541 --> 02:28:51,340
and truly are true believers
in what they're doing.

2507
02:28:51,341 --> 02:28:54,710
Like really have gotten
the fucking, um, the,

2508
02:28:54,711 --> 02:28:57,670
the language virus to the,
to, to the nth degree.

2509
02:28:57,671 --> 02:29:02,671
And for really believe that they have
to fucking shoot the abortion doctor in

2510
02:29:04,241 --> 02:29:08,030
the fucking face, you know, really fucking
believe till like all the way to the,

2511
02:29:08,031 --> 02:29:08,771
the,
you know,

2512
02:29:08,771 --> 02:29:12,730
bottom level where it's just like
people are trying to look fucking cool

2513
02:29:13,100 --> 02:29:13,761
or even worse.

2514
02:29:13,761 --> 02:29:16,190
How about the guy who goes to the Sikh
temple and doesn't even understand the

2515
02:29:16,191 --> 02:29:19,580
Sikhs are very peaceful people and thinks
that they're Muslims and somehow way,

2516
02:29:19,840 --> 02:29:22,360
and he's got nine 11 tattoos on the
spot and he kills a bunch of beer.

2517
02:29:22,400 --> 02:29:26,150
Yeah, yeah. How about that? No. See
this, you want to Alex Jones it up.

2518
02:29:27,140 --> 02:29:30,950
False flag operations. False
flag. Well, look, man, I don't,

2519
02:29:31,010 --> 02:29:32,840
I don't fucking know man. I, I,

2520
02:29:32,841 --> 02:29:37,670
but I do think that the complexity
of that, that I think that the, uh,

2521
02:29:38,200 --> 02:29:39,860
that,
that greedy,

2522
02:29:39,861 --> 02:29:44,600
selfish lying people tend to use
complexity to their advantage. And,

2523
02:29:44,660 --> 02:29:45,380
uh,

2524
02:29:45,380 --> 02:29:49,670
people who seem to be more on the
fucking beam as the free masons say,

2525
02:29:49,940 --> 02:29:54,470
um, have very simple ideas,
very simple fucking ideas.

2526
02:29:55,070 --> 02:29:58,370
Like what Ma, what Gandhi said,
do, you know, very simple idea.

2527
02:29:58,490 --> 02:30:03,290
Find someone who needs help and help them.
It's simple and it right away.

2528
02:30:03,291 --> 02:30:06,440
Some assholes, the Kale, but what does
that mean? What does help mean? It's like,

2529
02:30:06,470 --> 02:30:07,610
I'll tell you what help means.

2530
02:30:07,940 --> 02:30:10,490
Somebody fucking might need
you to loan them some money.

2531
02:30:10,640 --> 02:30:12,740
Somebody might need you
to bring them some soup.

2532
02:30:12,920 --> 02:30:16,940
Somebody might need a ride to the fucking
airport. It's not complicated, man.

2533
02:30:17,150 --> 02:30:21,170
It's basic. And if everyone starts
following the basic principles like that,

2534
02:30:21,930 --> 02:30:24,150
then there's plenty of
resources. Yeah, yeah.

2535
02:30:24,610 --> 02:30:24,840
The,

2536
02:30:24,840 --> 02:30:29,230
the real problem is we've got this weird
competitive game that's going on and

2537
02:30:29,231 --> 02:30:31,270
it's a,
it's set up not,

2538
02:30:31,271 --> 02:30:36,271
not an efficient way where we generate
just the amount that we need in order to

2539
02:30:36,611 --> 02:30:37,420
be happy,

2540
02:30:37,420 --> 02:30:41,160
but in some crazy way where you never
think enough is enough and there'd be,

2541
02:30:41,170 --> 02:30:44,470
the game becomes part
of what motivates you.

2542
02:30:44,710 --> 02:30:47,530
And instead of it just
being about happiness,

2543
02:30:47,560 --> 02:30:50,530
it's sometimes morphs into
just being about the numbers,

2544
02:30:51,190 --> 02:30:52,330
just being about the game,

2545
02:30:52,580 --> 02:30:55,780
just being about accomplishments
and you get nutty and you'd like,

2546
02:30:55,781 --> 02:31:00,100
you could become a vendor Holyfield when
you're living in 110 room mansion that

2547
02:31:00,101 --> 02:31:03,070
cost $1 million a year to keep
the electricity on. I mean that's,

2548
02:31:03,550 --> 02:31:06,990
people can get like that. Yeah.
There's a, I saw a fucking, uh,

2549
02:31:07,150 --> 02:31:11,950
a piece of real estate online the other
day that was a house for 40 fucking

2550
02:31:11,980 --> 02:31:14,890
million dollars. I was looking
at this house. I was like,

2551
02:31:15,040 --> 02:31:17,850
that is the craziest fucking Shit
I've ever seen in my life. There's,

2552
02:31:17,890 --> 02:31:20,280
but somewhere there's
a dude is like a medic

2553
02:31:20,280 --> 02:31:23,550
to take it to the next level and I'm
here with this $10 million house.

2554
02:31:23,551 --> 02:31:27,160
It's a piece of shit to me and many
to move up fucking inkjet national.

2555
02:31:27,161 --> 02:31:30,030
Want to be at the top monetary
gangster type motherfucker.

$103,000 a seat. Wow.

2574
02:32:29,880 --> 02:32:34,780
The girls chilling in a mansion.

dope ass houses. Yes. It, yeah. Wow.

2576
02:32:40,200 --> 02:32:43,920
Wow. Those guys live in a fucking
castle. Yeah, and they live in castles.

2577
02:32:44,310 --> 02:32:46,920
It must be really hard
to be like, well, yeah,

2578
02:32:46,960 --> 02:32:51,640
Harry has 107,000 I put the
receipt online. What a Douche bag.

2579
02:32:51,750 --> 02:32:56,490
But cokes are like 10 bucks
Central Pa. Yeah. Cappuccinos.

2580
02:32:56,491 --> 02:33:00,420
$12 Coca Cola is $20 zero $10 to Coco's,

2581
02:33:00,720 --> 02:33:04,290
$10 each, but it's like
crazy wines. Dom Perignon,

2582
02:33:04,291 --> 02:33:07,830
$4,000 Oh,
another dom,

2583
02:33:08,070 --> 02:33:11,550
$5,000 Oh my God.
It's crazy.

2584
02:33:11,750 --> 02:33:16,740
Hundred seven grand for dinner.
What's the tip? Uh, it doesn't show.

2585
02:33:16,960 --> 02:33:20,490
I know it says 170 ground. It's got to
be maybe in central pay. You don't tip.

2586
02:33:21,450 --> 02:33:22,770
Maybe it's one of those weird places.

2587
02:33:22,830 --> 02:33:25,950
There's a lot of places where you
don't tip. Right? You know? Or you do.

2588
02:33:25,951 --> 02:33:28,460
You mean you can. I do, but they
don't. They don't expect it.

2589
02:33:28,480 --> 02:33:32,880
I'm sure the waiter gets taken care of
at a restaurant that has $107,000 dinners

2590
02:33:33,120 --> 02:33:36,180
maybe, but when you have
40,000 I said 4,000 I'm sorry,

2591
02:33:36,210 --> 02:33:41,210
I meant 40,000 the dom Perignon is $40,000
so as the other one that's not 5,000

2592
02:33:42,211 --> 02:33:45,690
it's 50,000 that's why it's so hard.
That's fucking incredible.

2593
02:33:45,870 --> 02:33:50,550
You can buy a bottle of something for
50,000 bucks. Sure. We sure it's dollars.

2594
02:33:51,210 --> 02:33:54,570
It's not. You can buy it. You can sell
it. That's the hopeful aspect of it.

2595
02:33:54,750 --> 02:33:55,740
There's dip shits out.

2596
02:33:55,741 --> 02:33:59,070
They're going to pay 50 fucking thousand
dollars for your goddamned carbonated

2597
02:33:59,400 --> 02:34:02,220
grape juice. How dumb
is that? That's awesome.

2598
02:34:02,320 --> 02:34:05,160
It's another craziest thing of all time
and someone would actually spend that

2599
02:34:05,161 --> 02:34:08,730
much more. I mean, how good could
it be because no way can be.

2600
02:34:09,180 --> 02:34:12,690
It's probably not even as good as
Koolaid Kool aid. It's fucking delicious.

2601
02:34:13,020 --> 02:34:17,040
Especially if you're really
thirsty. It's sweet. It's delicious.

2602
02:34:17,950 --> 02:34:18,430
Dude,

2603
02:34:18,430 --> 02:34:23,430
if I'm paying $40,000 for something
that should come out of the fucking some

2604
02:34:23,621 --> 02:34:27,460
frozen vault of Sandoz laboratories
in better piece of fucking,

2605
02:34:27,760 --> 02:34:32,620
they'd better be the acid that Hoffman
first generated and stored in a crystal

2606
02:34:32,621 --> 02:34:35,410
vile somewhere deep under the Pentagon.

2607
02:34:35,411 --> 02:34:38,920
That and even that maybe that would
be worth $50,000 cause it'd be so life

2608
02:34:38,921 --> 02:34:43,790
changing. Yeah. Yeah. It's kind
of silly man. It's kind of the,

2609
02:34:43,791 --> 02:34:47,770
the the weird thing with wine.
Wine is such a strange beverage.

2610
02:34:48,270 --> 02:34:51,950
Those people that get together and work
on the tastes of it and they have an

2611
02:34:51,951 --> 02:34:55,300
educated pallets and some of
them like they become, you know,

2612
02:34:55,301 --> 02:34:59,050
like high level Somalia as they can like
to tact like where the grapes are from,

2613
02:34:59,051 --> 02:35:03,550
but just by taste and a glass of wine.
Dude, it's weird. It's fucking weird.

2614
02:35:03,551 --> 02:35:04,060
But it's,

2615
02:35:04,060 --> 02:35:07,390
I mean definitely like when I went up to
like I want to have to fucking solving

2616
02:35:07,391 --> 02:35:12,391
wants to like get to drink like wine
from the vineyards and it's awesome dude.

2617
02:35:12,640 --> 02:35:16,920
It's incredible. Then what over the
variations in the taste and the like.

2618
02:35:17,020 --> 02:35:21,190
The beauty of this set of the terrain.
It's like a really beautiful thing man.

2619
02:35:21,191 --> 02:35:24,190
It's like what's it like up there as
a different, what's the climate like?

2620
02:35:25,330 --> 02:35:29,010
I think when we were there it was hot as
I recall man and summer was the summer.

2621
02:35:29,110 --> 02:35:30,400
It was summer and we got this,

2622
02:35:30,430 --> 02:35:33,190
you get like cars to drive around because
you're going to get trashed going to

2623
02:35:33,191 --> 02:35:33,671
the vineyard,

2624
02:35:33,671 --> 02:35:38,320
slurp and all that wine and our fucking
goddamn driver was like an Aa dude.

2625
02:35:38,800 --> 02:35:40,120
It's like still our drivers,

2626
02:35:40,121 --> 02:35:44,410
this sober guy driving us to the vineyards
and you felt kind of guilty by the

2627
02:35:44,410 --> 02:35:48,010
end of the day cause you're just like in
the back of the God damn car with like

2628
02:35:48,011 --> 02:35:52,240
crusty red wine all over
Your Lips wanting to pee,

2629
02:35:52,420 --> 02:35:55,270
come much wine. Did you drink
over the course of a day? Oh God,

2630
02:35:59,380 --> 02:36:03,010
I didn't have to worry about a DUI and
I was taking marijuana tincture at the

2631
02:36:03,011 --> 02:36:06,280
same time. So what did you think?
You tried to half a gallon maybe?

2632
02:36:08,200 --> 02:36:09,310
Oh yeah,
he's

2633
02:36:11,180 --> 02:36:14,500
a half a gallon of wine.

2634
02:36:14,800 --> 02:36:19,030
But I would imagine it's pretty,
people must be fallen down,

2635
02:36:19,040 --> 02:36:20,890
left and right upon their trashed.

2636
02:36:20,891 --> 02:36:23,230
And by the end of the day
you're like slurring your words,

2637
02:36:24,070 --> 02:36:29,020
gesturing at fucking being great, great.
Like things on the menu. Barely talk.

2638
02:36:29,080 --> 02:36:33,280
I can't, I can never do that. Just you
don't have to get, I can't, I can't get,

2639
02:36:33,340 --> 02:36:37,090
well I can't get drunk at dinner ever
because then I'm going to come home to the

2640
02:36:37,091 --> 02:36:39,040
kids.
I never really be drunk around my kids.

2641
02:36:39,041 --> 02:36:41,500
And that's why it's good to have kids,
man. God Damn it. The older I get,

2642
02:36:41,501 --> 02:36:45,010
the more than human I feel cause I
don't have a sweet little baby. Oh,

2643
02:36:45,011 --> 02:36:47,470
I'd love a little fucking taught.
I'm sure you would.

2644
02:36:47,471 --> 02:36:52,060
But you were first of all have to have a
relationship with a person. What? Deep,

2645
02:36:52,061 --> 02:36:55,720
deep relationship with a person and
know each other very, very, very well.

2646
02:36:56,040 --> 02:36:59,500
And you enjoy each other very much.
And if you don't, you're fucked.

2647
02:36:59,790 --> 02:37:02,950
And then it's a, becomes
a nightmare. But you know,

2648
02:37:03,250 --> 02:37:06,710
it keeps it from coming home drunk.
That's for fucking sure. No, it doesn't.

2649
02:37:07,690 --> 02:37:11,050
It doesn't keep a lot of people.
Well, they're fools. A lot of people.

2650
02:37:11,051 --> 02:37:12,180
It does not keep them going.

2651
02:37:12,820 --> 02:37:16,160
I think it's you should
not be or on your kid,

2652
02:37:16,280 --> 02:37:19,400
dude. Have you seen that picture of
the baby sleeping under the bar stool?

2653
02:37:19,670 --> 02:37:21,840
Here's the map picture.
I don't want to hear him around it.

2654
02:37:21,860 --> 02:37:24,890
Fucking dragging the kid to the bar. I
don't even want to hear about it. Dude.

2655
02:37:24,891 --> 02:37:28,040
There's so many people that just,
they just fucking get a shit.

2656
02:37:28,041 --> 02:37:31,710
Roll the dice and they're born
into a family full of dummies. Dom.

2657
02:37:31,711 --> 02:37:34,820
He is doing dumb things. Yeah
man. It's a bit of a problem.

2658
02:37:35,840 --> 02:37:39,290
I wondered if things are really changing
Dunkin the way I feel like they're

2659
02:37:39,291 --> 02:37:43,550
changing. I wonder if it's just my circle
of people and a wonder if it's just a,

2660
02:37:43,551 --> 02:37:46,750
the people that we come in contact with
through the podcast and through Twitter

2661
02:37:46,760 --> 02:37:48,560
that all the,
the positive people,

2662
02:37:48,740 --> 02:37:53,690
I wonder how much the world shares
in the sort of the, the vibe that we,

2663
02:37:53,700 --> 02:37:55,430
that we feel and that we're riding.

2664
02:37:55,970 --> 02:37:59,870
And I always wonder if that is what,

2665
02:38:01,040 --> 02:38:03,210
if putting that out there,
if,

2666
02:38:04,330 --> 02:38:09,330
if it's possible that we can get our
shit together by using the Internet,

2667
02:38:09,531 --> 02:38:12,670
by using podcasts, by using, you know,

2668
02:38:12,671 --> 02:38:17,360
a different ways to communicate to each
other that we can somehow another all be

2669
02:38:17,361 --> 02:38:22,310
reached an all get our shit together in
this generation more so than anybody's

2670
02:38:22,311 --> 02:38:23,200
ever done before.

2671
02:38:23,330 --> 02:38:26,690
Well, you know, man, I mean, I think
that there has to be a, um, you know,

2672
02:38:26,720 --> 02:38:29,810
everyone has to keep using the
technology. It's like, dude,

2673
02:38:29,811 --> 02:38:32,030
like when I went to fucking
Cincinnati might this guy,

2674
02:38:32,031 --> 02:38:36,110
I met this awesome guy named Izzy you
as you started his own podcast from

2675
02:38:36,111 --> 02:38:38,330
listening to your podcast
and listening to my podcast,

2676
02:38:38,331 --> 02:38:42,260
he started his own podcast
called tales from the hard side.

2677
02:38:42,261 --> 02:38:45,990
And he came inside. Yeah, but he
was, no man, he definitely is.

2678
02:38:46,030 --> 02:38:49,940
It's like a fucking car, like a rip dude.
Like he's definitely like had a awesome,

2679
02:38:50,010 --> 02:38:54,860
a very fascinating life. But you
know, the point is he started like,

2680
02:38:54,880 --> 02:38:59,690
he listened to this and then he started
doing, he started his own podcast and,

2681
02:38:59,750 --> 02:39:01,730
and, and like, he's like,

2682
02:39:01,760 --> 02:39:06,760
there's like a group of them who hang
out together now from like listening to

2683
02:39:06,801 --> 02:39:10,340
your podcast and from listening to my
podcast and they started their own fucking

2684
02:39:10,341 --> 02:39:13,820
podcasts, which is a kind of cool
thing. Fuck it. Because it's spreading.

2685
02:39:13,910 --> 02:39:17,750
It's spreading it more, you know,
it's like, it's like people,

2686
02:39:17,960 --> 02:39:22,960
the bottom line is you can't
get hierarchical with your
geography because a lot

2687
02:39:23,061 --> 02:39:25,270
of people are like, you know,
I just live in Pennsylvania.

2688
02:39:25,280 --> 02:39:27,200
There's no one here to have
a good conversation with her.

2689
02:39:27,410 --> 02:39:28,880
Wherever the fuck they say they live.
It's like,

2690
02:39:28,910 --> 02:39:33,650
I guarantee you're surrounded by people
who want to talk about philosophical

2691
02:39:33,651 --> 02:39:34,071
shit.

2692
02:39:34,071 --> 02:39:37,550
And when I connect with someone on a
level deeper than just what you had for

2693
02:39:37,551 --> 02:39:39,190
lunch and what the,
what will,

2694
02:39:39,200 --> 02:39:42,500
you know what fucking clothes are cool
or movies or whatever you say that.

2695
02:39:42,501 --> 02:39:45,860
But unless you're in a city,
that's probably not the
case. Dude. I was just in,

2696
02:39:45,920 --> 02:39:50,540
well, you know, yeah. That I, I depending
on how old your especially, Oh man,

2697
02:39:50,541 --> 02:39:52,130
all we all I know is that like,

2698
02:39:53,150 --> 02:39:54,920
I don't want to sound like too,
like weirdly

2699
02:39:55,420 --> 02:39:58,930
having myself on the back, but it's you
like when go to these fucking shows, dude,

2700
02:39:59,230 --> 02:40:01,340
there's thousands of fucking people there.
Yeah.

2701
02:40:01,341 --> 02:40:02,680
And when you talk to them after the show,

2702
02:40:02,681 --> 02:40:06,400
they're all really fucking cool and they
didn't all just come from metropolitan

2703
02:40:06,401 --> 02:40:07,210
areas.

2704
02:40:07,210 --> 02:40:11,590
These people are coming from different
towns and cities and then they have,

2705
02:40:11,591 --> 02:40:14,130
but they have access to
us. They don't, they might

2706
02:40:14,130 --> 02:40:17,100
not have access to people near them.
That's what I'm saying,

2707
02:40:17,101 --> 02:40:18,540
that also sharing those interests.

2708
02:40:18,541 --> 02:40:21,780
It might not be anybody around them
like that you might think there is,

2709
02:40:21,930 --> 02:40:23,620
but unless they're in a, a really, uh,

2710
02:40:23,640 --> 02:40:26,490
a large area where there's a
lot of people to choose from,

2711
02:40:26,670 --> 02:40:30,870
you might not be correct. It takes a
lot of people, a lot of focus to break,

2712
02:40:30,871 --> 02:40:33,750
to get the group of 2000 people that
will come to see one of our shows.

2713
02:40:33,960 --> 02:40:38,220
You got to go through hundreds
of thousands of regular
people to find those 2000

2714
02:40:38,221 --> 02:40:40,650
disenfranchise people that
really want to say fuck.

2715
02:40:40,651 --> 02:40:43,710
Yet Duncan Trussell to
a little Hobo Bitch.

2716
02:40:44,100 --> 02:40:47,610
You know the people that listen to
this podcast, that people that, look,

2717
02:40:47,611 --> 02:40:51,000
I've had people come up to me,
they'd say, I hate the word cunt.

2718
02:40:51,210 --> 02:40:55,020
And then I loved your podcast. The first
time I heard you say con, it bugged me,

2719
02:40:55,140 --> 02:40:58,080
but now I say it every day. Now
everything's a con to everyone's a con.

2720
02:40:58,081 --> 02:41:00,510
She's a contest is a comp. My
Cat's account, my sister's a cunt.

2721
02:41:01,110 --> 02:41:02,820
And it just becomes a
part of your vernacular.

2722
02:41:03,060 --> 02:41:04,680
And that's I'm nothing I'm proud of.

2723
02:41:05,520 --> 02:41:08,310
But that's the type of
thing that can happen.

2724
02:41:08,340 --> 02:41:11,550
And if it can happen with something bad
or stupid or ridiculous like the word

2725
02:41:11,551 --> 02:41:13,830
cunt,
it can happen with any sort of idea.

2726
02:41:13,890 --> 02:41:18,880
Any idea can get through because of
a podcast like the idea of, you know,

2727
02:41:18,900 --> 02:41:19,860
treating each other,

2728
02:41:20,130 --> 02:41:23,430
treating each other really as if we
are ourselves living in another life.

2729
02:41:23,670 --> 02:41:28,310
The idea of recognizing that this
really is a temporary situation, Shit,

2730
02:41:28,320 --> 02:41:31,290
duration, temporary situation and
you need to live it, you lead,

2731
02:41:31,291 --> 02:41:32,820
need to live this bitch up.
Okay,

2732
02:41:32,821 --> 02:41:34,760
because you're not going to
feel good unless you do. If you,

2733
02:41:34,761 --> 02:41:38,340
you hang back and be that guy that you
described earlier who was 30 well we

2734
02:41:38,341 --> 02:41:41,730
jumped forward, you'll get
my shit together and then
40 and still have a career.

2735
02:41:41,730 --> 02:41:44,250
But Hey man, I got a good job. I'm
going to keep it for a little while.

2736
02:41:44,251 --> 02:41:45,870
Maybe I'm going to learn
how to be an apprentice.

2737
02:41:46,470 --> 02:41:50,400
And then one day he's dead
and he his ride and Keel over.

2738
02:41:50,490 --> 02:41:51,750
Then it could be a guy like you,

2739
02:41:52,220 --> 02:41:55,680
a guy who's kind of peaks and
valleys and had dry spots and,

2740
02:41:55,880 --> 02:42:00,030
and now is riding this new crazy wave
where you sort of just figured out how to

2741
02:42:00,031 --> 02:42:04,920
get on the board. Really fucking travel.
Yeah. Yeah. That's a fucking cool thing,

2742
02:42:04,921 --> 02:42:09,420
man. It's because it's right there and
it just requires a kind of like a, um,

2743
02:42:09,450 --> 02:42:12,900
you just have to fucking, it's really,
so the thing is, it's so fucking simple.

2744
02:42:13,260 --> 02:42:17,130
It's like, and it's not, it's not
because to have access to people,

2745
02:42:17,131 --> 02:42:21,420
it's not simple by any stretch of the
imagination to have the right ideas. Sure.

2746
02:42:21,720 --> 02:42:24,300
But to, in order to get those
ideas in front of people,

2747
02:42:24,301 --> 02:42:26,820
that takes a heroic effort,
man.

2748
02:42:26,821 --> 02:42:30,000
I just like the thing that
I'm hesitating to say,

2749
02:42:30,001 --> 02:42:32,460
cause I don't want it to
sound fucking coffee is like,

2750
02:42:32,490 --> 02:42:36,090
I really do think that
people can like organize.

2751
02:42:36,760 --> 02:42:40,090
I do believe that in wherever you're at,
man, there's gotta be something that,

2752
02:42:40,110 --> 02:42:44,390
there's ways that you can fucking figure
out other people who like have that we

2753
02:42:44,420 --> 02:42:46,650
talk about here. Well,
I think through Twitter,

2754
02:42:46,680 --> 02:42:49,620
that's one way we can find out people
that are interested in the same kind of

2755
02:42:49,621 --> 02:42:52,440
shows that you're interested in and you
find out that you're in your job. Hey,

2756
02:42:52,590 --> 02:42:54,630
where's the cool motherfuckers
up in Tallahassee?

2757
02:42:54,810 --> 02:42:58,530
And you put that up on Twitter and you
know, put Tallahassee is a attach Hashtag.

2758
02:42:58,710 --> 02:43:01,470
Actually now people are doing it
back and forth. That's it dude.

2759
02:43:01,471 --> 02:43:02,360
And it's like that,

2760
02:43:02,361 --> 02:43:06,870
that it's really fucking important because
it's not just good enough to exist in

2761
02:43:06,871 --> 02:43:09,000
fucking digital space
with people you need.

2762
02:43:09,001 --> 02:43:12,010
It's like something about
getting into fucking meat space

2763
02:43:12,010 --> 02:43:15,850
with people and like exchanging
ideas and like being around people.

2764
02:43:15,851 --> 02:43:18,100
It like it.
Uh,

2765
02:43:18,490 --> 02:43:22,780
it kind of shines a light and the shadowy
darkness that can come in to you if

2766
02:43:22,781 --> 02:43:26,600
you've isolated yourself because you
feel like you're a psychotic freak with

2767
02:43:26,601 --> 02:43:29,590
insane ideas, you know, instead
of realizing like, no man,

2768
02:43:29,680 --> 02:43:32,530
a lot of people are thinking this
shit right now. A lot of people are,

2769
02:43:32,740 --> 02:43:36,400
a lot of people are willing to entertain
all sorts of alternative ideas.

2770
02:43:36,401 --> 02:43:39,790
You'd be amazed and they're around
you. You know, like Margo, boy,

2771
02:43:39,791 --> 02:43:43,990
Matt stags and down and where's the
Mississippi or some shit, it's Tennessee.

2772
02:43:43,991 --> 02:43:46,030
Something like that. Yeah.
Which Nashville is in Tennessee,

2773
02:43:46,031 --> 02:43:48,880
Tennessee as boss response as
those Mississippi. But you know,

2774
02:43:48,881 --> 02:43:51,340
he doesn't want to fucking be there
anymore once I get out of there.

2775
02:43:51,590 --> 02:43:53,650
The Internet,
the Internet.

2776
02:43:54,280 --> 02:43:59,020
Well I think stags is definitely like
a on the precipice of some crazy shit

2777
02:43:59,021 --> 02:44:03,220
happening cause he's like definitely
becoming like a conduit for a lot of crazy

2778
02:44:03,221 --> 02:44:07,750
ideas and he always hooks me up with
like some with great guests and he's

2779
02:44:07,751 --> 02:44:11,200
running the disinfect podcast too.
Yeah. So that's happening soon.

2780
02:44:11,220 --> 02:44:14,860
I have to get with them,
but yeah, it's um, we're,

2781
02:44:14,861 --> 02:44:19,150
we're living in a strange
time of transition. Um, I'm,
I'm really curious to see,

2782
02:44:19,600 --> 02:44:24,340
I think there's the whole Terence
Mckenna 2012 thing is like I,

2783
02:44:24,350 --> 02:44:26,710
I always,
I always laughed.

2784
02:44:26,740 --> 02:44:29,110
I always thought it would be
really cool if it was true,

2785
02:44:29,380 --> 02:44:32,950
but I'm way too stupid to really
understand any of the science behind it,

2786
02:44:32,980 --> 02:44:35,240
even if it's real or not.
Or the arguments behind it.

2787
02:44:35,520 --> 02:44:39,130
Like I saw the Watson disagreement
or I think it was called,

2788
02:44:39,131 --> 02:44:43,900
but Watson objection to Watson objection
was a a mathematician who deciphered

2789
02:44:43,901 --> 02:44:46,990
the TimeWave zero novelty theory
and had his own objection to it.

2790
02:44:47,460 --> 02:44:52,200
Fucking they both lost weight within the
first paragraph. I was like, Oh fuck.

2791
02:44:52,210 --> 02:44:56,410
You're saying there's also less complex
mathematical reputations. The theory,

2792
02:44:56,411 --> 02:44:58,030
and I've heard that just like you know,

2793
02:44:58,031 --> 02:45:02,830
leap year wasn't accounted for since
2012 happened sometime ago. So it's like,

2794
02:45:02,980 --> 02:45:04,600
you know the,
the the again,

2795
02:45:04,601 --> 02:45:07,960
but this is like people getting caught
up in the surface level shit and trying

2796
02:45:07,961 --> 02:45:12,010
to like no, no, it's not going to happen
on December 21st, 2012 and trying to like,

2797
02:45:12,011 --> 02:45:15,750
but it's like no, look what's happening
around you. I wonder if what they,

2798
02:45:15,760 --> 02:45:20,760
they calculated when the calculated
the Mayan calendars besides you know,

2799
02:45:21,040 --> 02:45:25,480
the moons, the, the, the
rather the eclipse of the moon
and the eclipse of the sun.

2800
02:45:25,660 --> 02:45:30,660
I wonder if they could calculate how
long it would take for a culture to grow

2801
02:45:31,151 --> 02:45:34,450
before it imploded.
I wonder if there's like just a us,

2802
02:45:34,480 --> 02:45:38,230
just a set number of like a
culture can only last for,

2803
02:45:38,410 --> 02:45:40,700
it's like you could run and
then you fall down. Yeah.

2804
02:45:40,780 --> 02:45:42,550
And they figured that out a long time ago.

2805
02:45:42,551 --> 02:45:46,180
They're good for like these 10,000
year pulses or whatever the fuck it is.

2806
02:45:46,600 --> 02:45:48,210
There's a guy, he's a easy, if you,

2807
02:45:48,220 --> 02:45:51,460
I bet if you googled extinction theorist
right now, that's what he's called.

2808
02:45:51,461 --> 02:45:56,080
He's a, he's a, he's also the guy who's
like into simulation theory too. Um,

2809
02:45:56,440 --> 02:45:57,430
and he's,
you know,

2810
02:45:57,431 --> 02:46:00,970
he's tries to answer that question while
we haven't encountered aliens species.

2811
02:46:00,971 --> 02:46:03,430
And it is this notion that
they implode in on themselves.

2812
02:46:03,431 --> 02:46:06,400
I can't remember if it's on Youtube.
I wish I can't remember his fucking name.

2813
02:46:06,401 --> 02:46:08,950
He's brilliant.
I put a clip of him on,

2814
02:46:09,080 --> 02:46:13,010
of my podcasts when the same podcast
that I was talking about. Uh,

2815
02:46:13,040 --> 02:46:15,680
the guy from the University of
Maryland because he was, he was,

2816
02:46:15,710 --> 02:46:18,140
he was the one who was talking
about the idea of vivisected.

2817
02:46:18,141 --> 02:46:21,490
The human brain are slicing it into,
um,

2818
02:46:21,800 --> 02:46:25,760
fucking a thin,
thin layers to scan the neurology.

2819
02:46:26,250 --> 02:46:30,110
I've done got no extinction theorist.
Shit man.

2820
02:46:30,111 --> 02:46:31,700
I can't remember his fucking name.
He's Barilla.

2821
02:46:31,701 --> 02:46:35,120
There's evolutionary theory of course.
But um,

2822
02:46:35,180 --> 02:46:37,850
last dinosaur extinction theory.
No.

2823
02:46:37,851 --> 02:46:42,680
If you look up simulation theory
and theory like studies, this shit,

2824
02:46:42,681 --> 02:46:45,320
it's a really weird like ways that we can,

2825
02:46:45,650 --> 02:46:50,540
ways that are a species could blink out.
Oh so,

2826
02:46:50,541 --> 02:46:53,510
so many ways.
Anywhere.

2827
02:46:54,080 --> 02:46:58,400
It's what the fuck is his name
and his got him. Brilliant.

2828
02:46:59,530 --> 02:47:01,720
Have you seen those um,
the impact of uh,

2829
02:47:02,230 --> 02:47:04,900
meteors a meteor shower
all over the world.

2830
02:47:04,901 --> 02:47:08,320
They discovered 12,000 years ago you told
me about this shit and the sedimentary

2831
02:47:08,321 --> 02:47:12,520
layers. Yeah, they've done core samples
and it's the same spot all over the globe.

2832
02:47:12,790 --> 02:47:15,520
And it's the same sort of shit that exists
when you have nuclear bombs going off

2833
02:47:15,850 --> 02:47:19,540
and it makes like a glass
so little,

2834
02:47:19,660 --> 02:47:24,660
the world got pelted by fucking giant
chunks of rock gets flowed sound of that

2835
02:47:26,801 --> 02:47:30,280
ship bursting through breaking.
The fucking sound barrier is,

2836
02:47:30,281 --> 02:47:34,560
it goes rocketing down into
the fucking earth. Boom, boom.

2837
02:47:34,561 --> 02:47:39,400
That must've been fucked up man. I wonder
if they had writing back then. Cause,

2838
02:47:39,401 --> 02:47:43,230
I don't know if we know that they had
writing 12,000 years ago. I know it,

2839
02:47:43,280 --> 02:47:46,120
it all dependent upon
whether or not that event,

2840
02:47:46,121 --> 02:47:51,070
that 12,000 year old event was really
the sort of mass extinction event that

2841
02:47:51,071 --> 02:47:54,880
like Graham Hancock and a lot of
people think might've happened to, uh,

2842
02:47:55,270 --> 02:48:00,270
to human culture or cute humankind
rather the human species because they,

2843
02:48:00,441 --> 02:48:01,031
they,
you know,

2844
02:48:01,031 --> 02:48:04,840
there's a lot of speculation about
like when is the oldest civilization?

2845
02:48:04,840 --> 02:48:09,130
And they pretty much settle on Mesopotamia
and they set them on like Sumeria.

2846
02:48:09,520 --> 02:48:10,540
But the,
the,

2847
02:48:10,570 --> 02:48:15,280
the Sumerian text details along
lost civilization and older advanced

2848
02:48:15,281 --> 02:48:16,660
civilization,
like the kind of all,

2849
02:48:16,661 --> 02:48:21,480
do they all talk about some dudes
existed before really had it down. Yeah.

2850
02:48:21,520 --> 02:48:24,580
And Samira was supposed to
be like 6,000 this years ago.

2851
02:48:25,030 --> 02:48:26,680
So imagine if that's what it was.

2852
02:48:26,710 --> 02:48:31,010
So 6,000 year track from the
time that they got pelted with,

2853
02:48:31,090 --> 02:48:34,960
we can wrap our heads around how
long that is. That's so long ago,

2854
02:48:35,020 --> 02:48:39,190
but yet nothing, you know, in its greater
spectrum of the universe, nothing.

2855
02:48:39,191 --> 02:48:43,480
But in the, the, the idea of
our lifetime, 6,000 years old,

2856
02:48:43,481 --> 02:48:46,060
long fucking time ago,

2857
02:48:46,510 --> 02:48:50,620
and they talked about an old civilization
and old ancient civilization that

2858
02:48:50,621 --> 02:48:53,410
existed that was wiped
out the epic of Gilgamesh,

2859
02:48:53,411 --> 02:48:57,150
which is essentially very similar to
the Noah's Ark story about, about it.

2860
02:48:57,170 --> 02:49:00,700
Cataclysmic flood. Yeah.
Floods. Yeah. They uh,

2861
02:49:00,730 --> 02:49:03,040
they probably experienced
some fucking nutty shit, man.

2862
02:49:03,230 --> 02:49:06,010
It probably killed almost everybody.
That's probably,

2863
02:49:06,040 --> 02:49:10,530
that probably explains a of Shit. A lot
of shit all over the world. Like gold,

2864
02:49:10,531 --> 02:49:11,580
Beckley,
Tat Bay,

2865
02:49:11,880 --> 02:49:15,570
all these weird structures that
they're finding from pre 12,000 years.

2866
02:49:15,770 --> 02:49:18,990
There's a beck go Beckley
templates 14,000 years ago.

2867
02:49:19,170 --> 02:49:21,210
That means in Sumeria,

2868
02:49:21,240 --> 02:49:25,380
the really old shit in Sumeria
is like 6,000 plus years ago,

2869
02:49:25,500 --> 02:49:29,790
7,000 plus years ago.
This is double that.

2870
02:49:29,970 --> 02:49:34,970
So this is as old to Sumeria as we
are to Sumeria as soon Maoris to us,

2871
02:49:37,260 --> 02:49:38,250
that's the distance,

2872
02:49:39,120 --> 02:49:44,120
the distance of people writing on clay
tablets and scratches and these little

2873
02:49:45,631 --> 02:49:49,990
scratches up and down and sideways.
That was their whole language. And the,

2874
02:49:49,991 --> 02:49:54,900
the idea that they wrote of something
from 7,000 years previous maybe,

2875
02:49:55,340 --> 02:49:56,910
and that's what go Beckley topic shows.

2876
02:49:56,911 --> 02:50:01,860
It shows that there was a sophisticated
civilization from 7,000 years prior to

2877
02:50:01,861 --> 02:50:06,390
the, the people in Sumeria and the people
in Mesopotamia 7,000 years earlier,

2878
02:50:06,391 --> 02:50:09,180
they were making these 19 foot tall,

2879
02:50:09,330 --> 02:50:11,700
gigantic stone columns.

2880
02:50:11,910 --> 02:50:16,910
They were carved with animals that were
carved in a relief so that like they

2881
02:50:17,371 --> 02:50:20,670
stuck out, which is a really
sophisticated method of carving.

2882
02:50:20,850 --> 02:50:24,360
You're not carving into the stone.
You're actually making a relief.

2883
02:50:24,420 --> 02:50:29,420
It sticks out so you chipped all the rest
of the stone away to reveal this frog

2884
02:50:29,940 --> 02:50:33,510
and to reveal this bird.
And this is really sophisticated stuff.

2885
02:50:33,511 --> 02:50:35,130
It's hard for people to
wrap their heads around it.

2886
02:50:35,310 --> 02:50:38,410
So when they start talking to him about
like hunter and gatherers from, you know,

2887
02:50:38,411 --> 02:50:41,850
wearing skins around their dick, that
these are the ones that built this boy,

2888
02:50:41,880 --> 02:50:43,800
I don't know. I don't know. This is a you,

2889
02:50:43,801 --> 02:50:47,610
you might have more evidence of the fact
that there might've been some really

2890
02:50:47,611 --> 02:50:50,880
super advanced cultures.
They got fucking pelted.

2891
02:50:53,430 --> 02:50:58,170
Just wiped out everybody. No talking
anymore changed languages. No,

2892
02:50:58,200 --> 02:51:01,920
no fucking written shit. No one
knows how to write the fucking road.

2893
02:51:01,950 --> 02:51:05,910
Like it was like the road
nuclear ash falling down.

2894
02:51:05,911 --> 02:51:09,480
Just fucking,
just decimation.

2895
02:51:09,690 --> 02:51:11,430
Well by studying genetics,

2896
02:51:11,760 --> 02:51:16,500
I believe that they've found several
extinction events in the human genome.

2897
02:51:16,530 --> 02:51:20,470
Like they've isolated several events. I
don't understand the science behind this.

2898
02:51:20,500 --> 02:51:23,700
I really am talking like
extremely deep out of my ass,

2899
02:51:24,090 --> 02:51:28,920
but I believe they've shown
that um, when studying the, the,

2900
02:51:28,950 --> 02:51:32,670
the DNA from different human
beings of all over the world,

2901
02:51:32,671 --> 02:51:36,210
they've concluded that there've been
several times where the human species has

2902
02:51:36,211 --> 02:51:40,380
gotten very low as low as like a few
thousand people and that, you know,

2903
02:51:40,381 --> 02:51:44,400
we probably had a big number and then a
much smaller number and it got as low as

2904
02:51:44,401 --> 02:51:47,340
a few thousand people and then we
had to recover. It's fucking amazing.

2905
02:51:47,760 --> 02:51:50,670
It's amazing what they found out
just by studying genes. You know,

2906
02:51:50,780 --> 02:51:54,130
you will live in this kind of like that.
One of the ideas of like the,

2907
02:51:54,180 --> 02:51:57,900
the Freemasons are the rosy cruise
shins are the secret societies.

2908
02:51:57,901 --> 02:52:01,830
Is that that information
from a very long time ago,

2909
02:52:01,840 --> 02:52:05,730
it's been kept secret like yeah,

2910
02:52:05,980 --> 02:52:09,590
they sit but they kind of
work signs do each other.

2911
02:52:09,610 --> 02:52:13,110
They work symbols into the
architecture of society. Right.

2912
02:52:13,340 --> 02:52:17,390
Which is that fucking crazy guy.
Damn. If you look at this, the,

2913
02:52:17,391 --> 02:52:20,560
the street configurations
of Washington DC,

2914
02:52:21,010 --> 02:52:25,570
have you seen that shit where it's like
a anatomically correct eyeball looking

2915
02:52:25,571 --> 02:52:29,860
out over a pyramid? Just like the
I and the dollar bill. I mean,

2916
02:52:29,861 --> 02:52:30,694
come on dude.

2917
02:52:31,010 --> 02:52:33,450
How do you, how do you, how
would you describe that? If
I was going to Google that,

2918
02:52:33,490 --> 02:52:37,820
a masonic symbols and d c I don't know.

2919
02:52:37,950 --> 02:52:42,270
Washington DC, my sonic
Washington DC road roads are guys,

2920
02:52:42,271 --> 02:52:45,180
I don't know fucking,
well it's you stoned to Google.

2921
02:52:46,670 --> 02:52:51,180
I want to go with masonic symbols
in DC. Yup. Here it is. Yeah.

2922
02:52:51,181 --> 02:52:55,530
The um, they have it laid out. Yeah.

2923
02:52:55,770 --> 02:52:56,520
Wow.

2924
02:52:56,520 --> 02:52:59,970
I mean that's, that's like you got to
really believe you have a Pentagram. Yeah.

2925
02:52:59,971 --> 02:53:02,630
There's a Pentagram in there.
There's a a fucking awesome.

2926
02:53:03,270 --> 02:53:07,890
So, so strange. Yeah, there's an
eye, there's an optic nerve and I,

2927
02:53:07,891 --> 02:53:08,910
there's a Pentagram.

2928
02:53:10,530 --> 02:53:13,530
It's real weird when you look at like
the money and you see the fucking all

2929
02:53:13,531 --> 02:53:18,270
seeing eye in a pyramid on the cap
of the pyramid is the all seeing eye.

2930
02:53:18,300 --> 02:53:19,650
Like what are you saying?

2931
02:53:19,880 --> 02:53:22,460
I mean look man, printing
it on money. Okay,

2932
02:53:22,490 --> 02:53:27,490
but how about putting into the Goddamn
geography of the fucking capitol of the

2933
02:53:27,860 --> 02:53:32,540
country that you made?
Trying to embody the ideals that you know,

2934
02:53:32,541 --> 02:53:37,520
you knew and you encoded into the
fucking very patterns. I mean,

2935
02:53:37,521 --> 02:53:41,120
look man, there's a goddamn
monolith. The Washington monument,

2936
02:53:41,121 --> 02:53:46,121
an obelisk and Egyptian fucking obelisk
rising up out of our nation's capitol.

2937
02:53:46,760 --> 02:53:50,450
Yeah. Remember how the Egyptians
helped with the revolutionary war?

2938
02:53:52,470 --> 02:53:56,530
Cause I know they were there for us. Yeah.
They came over and provided us with a,

2939
02:53:57,550 --> 02:53:59,260
uh,
what's,

2940
02:53:59,261 --> 02:54:03,850
what's even crazier is that Egypt at
one point in time was thriving and then

2941
02:54:04,140 --> 02:54:06,360
it's, this was nothing
there. Like they, they,

2942
02:54:06,361 --> 02:54:10,000
they showed up and the spanx was like
covered up to its neck like during the age

2943
02:54:10,001 --> 02:54:13,240
of Napoleon when they, when they first
found that it was like a fucking,

2944
02:54:13,241 --> 02:54:16,210
everything is abandoned. They'd already
alluded all these different tombs.

2945
02:54:16,330 --> 02:54:20,920
Who knows how much really incredible
shit was melted down for gold baubles and

2946
02:54:20,921 --> 02:54:23,350
shit when they didn't
understand historical worth.

2947
02:54:23,520 --> 02:54:24,660
Well, I mean, dude,

2948
02:54:24,680 --> 02:54:29,680
that I like one thing that like over
time the time has proven again and again

2949
02:54:30,481 --> 02:54:35,130
and again is that shit doesn't always
work out great for the smart people with

2950
02:54:35,131 --> 02:54:40,020
good ideas. You end up getting thrown into
basements by dumb people who are like,

2951
02:54:40,021 --> 02:54:44,490
what the fuck are you talking about?
Galileo, they ended up in prison in you.

2952
02:54:44,491 --> 02:54:47,640
Sometimes they crucify you,
sometimes they embarrass you,

2953
02:54:47,760 --> 02:54:50,730
sometimes they take away your property.
So over time,

2954
02:54:50,970 --> 02:54:52,590
really smart people were like,
you know what,

2955
02:54:53,840 --> 02:54:56,160
why don't we just fucking
keep this shit to ourselves?

2956
02:55:01,230 --> 02:55:01,940
Well, you know, that's it. The

2957
02:55:01,940 --> 02:55:06,100
theory behind the mushrooms and
the church, that's the theory. Uh,

2958
02:55:06,270 --> 02:55:09,120
I mean a lot of this was a
young Urban's work and, um,

2959
02:55:09,740 --> 02:55:12,380
another dude who died who turned
out to be a child molester,

2960
02:55:12,590 --> 02:55:16,550
but he did a lot of really good work,
uh, with, um, with the, with mushrooms,

2961
02:55:16,551 --> 02:55:17,780
with the historical,

2962
02:55:18,080 --> 02:55:22,070
and he was writing a book with Jack Herer
when he got arrested for being a child

2963
02:55:22,071 --> 02:55:22,431
molester.

2964
02:55:22,431 --> 02:55:25,940
This guy fucked up Jack Herer because of
fucked up the research and were really

2965
02:55:25,941 --> 02:55:30,050
like sort of invalidated and a lot of
people's ideas like this work this guy had

2966
02:55:30,051 --> 02:55:31,160
done.
Um,

2967
02:55:31,190 --> 02:55:36,190
but they have so many images and photos
of ancient religious art that involves

2968
02:55:36,331 --> 02:55:39,270
mushrooms. Symbolism. When you looked
at it over and over and over again,

2969
02:55:39,300 --> 02:55:42,860
you're like, oh my God. Like this is so
obvious. Like first of all, the Halos,

2970
02:55:43,220 --> 02:55:46,580
the Halos did not look like the,
the Frisbee thing, the Hula Hoop.

2971
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:51,110
They looked like a mushroom cap and they
were circular behind the person's head.

2972
02:55:51,111 --> 02:55:54,710
And the idea was to insinuate that that
person that holds the person was under

2973
02:55:54,711 --> 02:55:58,070
the influence of God under the
influence of the mushroom. Yes.

2974
02:55:58,100 --> 02:56:00,950
And that's totally believable.
And that makes a lot of subtly believable.

2975
02:56:00,980 --> 02:56:03,860
And the images of the doors,
they're shaped like mushrooms,

2976
02:56:04,100 --> 02:56:07,670
doorways are shaped like one is mushroom
symbolism and so many different places.

2977
02:56:07,671 --> 02:56:10,430
And there was so many
images of people in bliss,

2978
02:56:10,490 --> 02:56:15,290
naked in bliss covered in a mushroom.
They would be in a transparent mushroom.

2979
02:56:15,291 --> 02:56:17,120
These are like fucking ancient paintings.

2980
02:56:17,960 --> 02:56:20,320
I mean, yeah, it's definitely like we,

2981
02:56:20,350 --> 02:56:24,980
we do know that there are encoded into
the fucking a framework of our society

2982
02:56:24,981 --> 02:56:28,160
and the Goddamn architecture of our
society. Or it's a very odd symbols.

2983
02:56:28,161 --> 02:56:31,640
Like if you look at the
um, uh, the cathedrals,

2984
02:56:31,790 --> 02:56:36,080
you will find gnostic sim
symbols, chicken, God's Abraxis.

2985
02:56:36,081 --> 02:56:39,140
You can see Abraxis in some
cathedrals. What does a chicken, God,

2986
02:56:39,290 --> 02:56:42,530
it's some gnostic fucking God
you can Wikipedia praxis. It's,

2987
02:56:42,531 --> 02:56:46,460
this happens to be the same name of the
company doing this goddamn trap wire

2988
02:56:46,461 --> 02:56:50,480
shit too. Yeah. Look up Abraxis
gnostic Abraxas at chicken headache.

2989
02:56:50,510 --> 02:56:52,520
How do you spell it? A. B. R a.

2990
02:56:52,540 --> 02:56:57,530
N praxis access Abraxis gnostic Wikipedia.

2991
02:57:00,950 --> 02:57:01,850
For some reason,

2992
02:57:01,851 --> 02:57:06,851
the creepiest God damn information
gathering surveillance company that's ever

2993
02:57:06,921 --> 02:57:11,000
climbed out of the shadows or been exposed
to happen to name themselves after a

2994
02:57:11,001 --> 02:57:15,290
gnostic God with a chicken
head. What the fuck man? Yeah,

2995
02:57:15,291 --> 02:57:19,900
go figure a chicken. God. Well
this thing is freaky looking. Yeah,

2996
02:57:19,910 --> 02:57:24,170
it's freaky looking and
that's in cathedrals. They
like, it's like a lot of the,

2997
02:57:24,440 --> 02:57:26,990
the um, the, that, you know,
a lot of these symbols,

2998
02:57:26,991 --> 02:57:30,920
they what they think it feeds roles
were apparently I read this and I can't

2999
02:57:30,921 --> 02:57:31,281
remember the name.

3000
02:57:31,281 --> 02:57:35,180
It's one of Graham Hancock's books that
fucking stag sent me cause he's trying

3001
02:57:35,181 --> 02:57:39,950
to drive me insane. But one of the, but,

3002
02:57:39,951 --> 02:57:42,290
but, but um, but yeah, like in the,

3003
02:57:42,291 --> 02:57:46,040
in this fucking book it talks about how
the cathedrals were like a nexus where,

3004
02:57:46,041 --> 02:57:49,760
um, a person's shoulders, a
chicken man chose it as a, ma'am,

3005
02:57:49,970 --> 02:57:53,240
I've seen the one with the chicken. It's
definitely a chicken. Oh, that's weird.

3006
02:57:53,241 --> 02:57:57,350
Because this one, uh, this image is
a man. Look, Google Abraxis chicken.

3007
02:57:57,980 --> 02:58:02,160
Okay. Fast gnostic chicken and
fucking Nashville. It's a great

3008
02:58:02,160 --> 02:58:07,080
name for a fucking chicken for
this man. Abraxis chicken. Chicken,

3009
02:58:07,081 --> 02:58:10,410
God. Chicken. God. Yeah. Just a
braxet chicken. It's got chicken.

3010
02:58:14,390 --> 02:58:15,223
Okay.

3011
02:58:16,450 --> 02:58:20,920
No, I'm looking at my main for chicken.
Abraxis it comes up right away.

3012
02:58:20,980 --> 02:58:22,960
Let's see.
Abraxis it comes up.

3013
02:58:22,990 --> 02:58:26,560
Do an image search but the chicken
doesn't come up. Do you want to name it?

3014
02:58:27,230 --> 02:58:30,820
Emits emits. Oh yeah. I'm
the images is one of them.
Where it looks like a chicken.

3015
02:58:30,880 --> 02:58:35,200
It's a fucking chicken. Well it's crazy
though. It's a chicken holding a um, uh,

3016
02:58:35,710 --> 02:58:39,400
a mallet. Yeah. One of those
things. A shield on one side. Wow.

3017
02:58:39,401 --> 02:58:44,200
What a fucking freak animal.
Yeah, it's freaky. Jesus Christ.

3018
02:58:44,530 --> 02:58:46,720
And what we, what year is
this from? I have no idea.

3019
02:58:47,440 --> 02:58:49,750
So they were high when they
came up with that, right? Yeah.

3020
02:58:49,751 --> 02:58:52,630
There's no other way I chicken
with a shield. Chicken. God,

3021
02:58:52,780 --> 02:58:56,050
how are you going to definitely take
different, you're drawing a chicken.

3022
02:58:57,720 --> 02:59:01,450
This chicken guy. Wow. There's all this
crazy images of it where it looked like a,

3023
02:59:01,990 --> 02:59:05,740
like a heartbeat or something. No read
