[inaudible] listen to that music.

19
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:12,520
I have like an extra echo in there.
Are you sampling your own shit?

20
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,190
I'm just fucking around with the
mixer. Oh, is that what you did?

21
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,860
Did you go DJ on us right there?

22
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,840
Did you go straight Russell Peters on a
bitch but test low or whatever his name

23
00:01:22,841 --> 00:01:25,360
is. You'd like to a class
once at a community college.

24
00:01:25,361 --> 00:01:27,130
You're trying to put that to good use.
I know.

25
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:31,600
Who was the guy that he ate a Tesla guys.
That huge guy. The guy who was of no,

26
00:01:31,601 --> 00:01:35,710
what is that guy's name?
Stoats. Yesto. Yeah. Ts though.

27
00:01:35,711 --> 00:01:37,690
I was trying to explain him to Mrs Rogan.
The end of the day.

28
00:01:37,691 --> 00:01:40,130
We were driving down the highway and
there was this big billboard for this ts

29
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,880
tow guy and really that billboard.
Oh Dude,

30
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,750
I don't think you and I haven't
any idea how big that guy is.

31
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:51,490
I've looked online and
watched his concerts where
it's like him on a stage and

32
00:01:51,491 --> 00:01:54,860
he's got like a bunch of laptops and a
bunch of musical equipment and he's like

33
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,540
pumping his fist and there's a huge
audience of people that are like dancing

34
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:02,530
along to him. And I, I don't know
how many big Djs are like that.

35
00:02:02,531 --> 00:02:05,590
We'd have to get Russell Peters back
on to explain to us the whole world of

36
00:02:05,591 --> 00:02:08,980
deejaying because Russell doesn't like
the guy cause he says that what he's

37
00:02:08,981 --> 00:02:12,430
basically doing is sort of like pressing
play on all the computers and then

38
00:02:12,431 --> 00:02:13,900
waving his arm up. But you know, I,

39
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:17,980
I've been listening to it because my
friends are like set a lie and I've been

40
00:02:17,981 --> 00:02:21,100
listening to it and it's, you know, it's
not bad. I know. Wait Russell saying,

41
00:02:21,101 --> 00:02:23,170
but it's all about like how you
feel when you're listening to it.

42
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,240
I'll take that any day over
at [inaudible]. Oh shit man.

43
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,990
I mean that they just crammed down her
fucking ass is your friend that likes it.

44
00:02:31,991 --> 00:02:36,070
A girl or a guy? A girl, a girl.
But I like that same kind of music,

45
00:02:36,071 --> 00:02:39,160
that kind of chillax music where
you're just like, yeah, it's, it's um,

46
00:02:39,161 --> 00:02:41,550
what he's doing is interesting.
You know what I mean? It's,

47
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,380
it's not d I understand
where Russell saying,

48
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,110
it's sort of like a guy going on
stage in a statue, a sketch group on,

49
00:02:48,111 --> 00:02:51,100
on stage saying he's a standup
comic and you're like, you know,

50
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,100
it's still good. I mean, come
on man. You can't deny it.

51
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,610
Like some sketch shows like
in living color or you know,

52
00:02:57,611 --> 00:03:00,730
some Saturday night live sketches, they're
fucking brilliant. It's fun to watch.

53
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,870
A lot of them suck.

54
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:05,800
Like I'm not a fan of like sketch comedy
because it's too much miss to the hit,

55
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:06,850
you know?
It's like a,

56
00:03:06,851 --> 00:03:09,430
for every really good sketch
you get on senator didn't live.

57
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:13,520
You have to endorse him. Bullshit.
Yeah. I can't do it man. But,

58
00:03:13,521 --> 00:03:16,400
but Russell is saying this do just
pretty much just pressing play.

59
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,110
Like it gets all the music together
beforehand or whatever he programs at all.

60
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:23,200
But he's making it pretty bad
ass if all these fucking, I mean,

61
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:25,840
I know I'm not a fan of it.
I never got into it.

62
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:28,960
Maybe I could get into it if I really
sat down and listen to it, but damn,

63
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:32,740
he's got these fucking huge arenas
filled with people jumping up and down

64
00:03:32,741 --> 00:03:35,560
whatever drug they're on or not.
You know what it was on.

65
00:03:35,561 --> 00:03:39,610
If it's an x to see situation
Molly, yeah, whatever. Or maybe not.

66
00:03:39,611 --> 00:03:42,040
Maybe it's just they're having a good
time, but you know, I don't, I don't know,

67
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,620
but whatever it is for them,
it's fucking awesome.

68
00:03:44,621 --> 00:03:48,850
You can tell that that music for them,
it might not click for you or me,

69
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:51,490
but he can't say sucks.
You know?

70
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,930
And Russell just says he
sucks sorta because he's not
really a Dj like Russell's

71
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:57,190
at Dj.
Like Russell,

72
00:03:57,191 --> 00:04:01,420
like remember when Russell was over and
he picked up this fucking beat that like

73
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:04,390
a secondary beat in the back
of a song like you said? No,

74
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:08,170
they're also sampling like salt and
pepper right here. And we were like, what?

75
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,400
Like play that back again.

76
00:04:09,401 --> 00:04:13,480
We had to play it like three or four times
and still we were like an uneducated,

77
00:04:13,481 --> 00:04:17,740
a morons trying to like test wine with
a Somalia. You know what I'm saying?

78
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:22,390
Well I would, I would see, I don't even
consider Tashi or tests or whatever.

79
00:04:22,391 --> 00:04:25,450
The guy's Tsl. Yes. Though I
don't even consider him a DJ.

80
00:04:25,451 --> 00:04:30,420
I just music of electronic music producer.
That's a good,

81
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,130
yeah, you're right. I know a few djs
but I've never heard of this guy.

82
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:38,131
And you said you've seen a billboard like
Dane Cook of Dj even bigger than Dane

83
00:04:39,851 --> 00:04:41,740
was when Damien isn't,
it was in his prime.

84
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:44,800
This guy is [inaudible]
nationwide or worldwide rather.

85
00:04:44,801 --> 00:04:47,080
He's huge all over Europe.
He's huge.

86
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:51,760
This guy does like 50,000 seat arenas
where people are out there like pumping

87
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:53,650
their fists and he's
fucking playing records.

88
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,180
I mean there's one thing
if the music's good,

89
00:04:55,181 --> 00:04:59,890
but I mean there's art to being a Dj
about mixing the stuff right there when

90
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:01,300
you're on stage being in that moment.

91
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,280
But if you're just sitting there
pushing play fucked up. Well,

92
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:06,910
I think a lot of people are looking for
cool shit to do when you're fucked up on

93
00:05:06,911 --> 00:05:11,530
drugs and when it comes to cool shit
to do and you're fucked up on drugs,

94
00:05:11,531 --> 00:05:16,060
this guy's need device to go
sweat like a laser show. I tuned,

95
00:05:16,061 --> 00:05:18,790
if you're on ecstasy and you'd go
to one of his shows, first of all,

96
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:21,510
you're going to be sure there's going to
be a lot of other people on ecstasy to,

97
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,500
yeah,
I mean,

98
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,490
it's electronic music and everyone's
dancing and everyone's drinking. Come on,

99
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,740
there's going to be ecstasy everywhere.
So if that's the case, you know,

100
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:34,180
this guy is really providing this fucking
cool symbiotic service with people

101
00:05:34,181 --> 00:05:38,080
that are tripping on an ecstasy he make.
He creates the full experience. You know,

102
00:05:38,081 --> 00:05:39,070
you know that you're going to,

103
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:41,620
he's going to draw them all and they're
all going to come to him because they

104
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:43,000
know what he does.
And then you,

105
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:45,310
so you're going to have your likeminded
people there that are going to want to

106
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:49,240
meet up at the [inaudible] concert and
then a everybody just fucking dances and

107
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:50,270
he puts on a show.
And,

108
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,140
and you're blitzed out of your fucking
head and you know it's going to last for

109
00:05:53,141 --> 00:05:58,020
four hours. Perfect. So He's like
the Dane Cook of Djs where he,

110
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:01,030
he's mixing songs and it just
really get that extra punch.

111
00:06:01,031 --> 00:06:02,530
He just does a leg kick or something.

112
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,230
He goes home at the end of every
show and emails. He does that.

113
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,110
He goes home and emails.
Everybody who came to his show,

114
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,030
there's a new sample. Yeah. Dane
would really do that, you know? Yeah.

115
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,850
He's a machine. Dean is, he's a
phene as far as like emailing people.

116
00:06:19,851 --> 00:06:23,260
It's really fun. But I mean
it's, the guy did it, you know,

117
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:26,300
the way he did it and it worked.
There's no,

118
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:29,900
no one else has ever become famous from
the instrument the way. Dang cooked it.

119
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,200
It was really, truly
spectacular. You know what he,

120
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:36,200
what he did like his comedy or not what
he did as far as like the marketing

121
00:06:36,201 --> 00:06:41,000
himself was fucking genius. Dane had
some good bits over the year. Dangerous.

122
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:44,390
You know, I like Dane. He's
not a bad dude. He's just, he,

123
00:06:44,391 --> 00:06:47,120
he lost his way a little bit there in the,

124
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:51,890
the great tide of wanting to be famous
and wanting to be a big comedian,

125
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:56,900
you know. But I think he's
paid for it. You know, think
he's paid his latest album,

126
00:06:56,901 --> 00:06:59,810
his, his blues stuff. I guess what uh,

127
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,260
what's it called where he was like raw
on stage and it was just filmed one take

128
00:07:03,261 --> 00:07:06,860
called an intimate evening or something.
The whole shit. The whole Bon Jovi,

129
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:10,700
the whole episode was filmed one Katie
went, went that's, I love that shit.

130
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,720
Yeah that was great. Even though it was
good. It was good. It was good stuff,

131
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,260
you know. And that was sort of like a
retribution thing for him. You know,

132
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,870
he hasn't done standup in a long time.
I ran into him at the warriors from here.

133
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,690
Let me just name drop real quick cause

134
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:31,450
you know I've been to like four.
I haven't had a formal, your true,

135
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,620
isn't it 20 fucking years
I've lived out here,

136
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,230
but my friend was in Brian
Cowan who was here yesterday,

137
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:41,250
was in warrior and I saw,
I met them. There. Is that
that came out warriors. Yeah,

138
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,970
it was it good. Yeah, it
was pretty good. But anyway,

139
00:07:43,971 --> 00:07:46,610
Dan said when I met him there that
he hadn't done standup in six months.

140
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,190
Good grief.
Yeah.

141
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:51,140
I saw him when he was working
on that blue, the blue stuff.

142
00:07:51,141 --> 00:07:55,340
Was that what this album was about? All
that kind of rocks? I didn't like it.

143
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,181
You didn't?
Yeah.

144
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:59,840
I mean he's one of those guys that I
think I heard his standup first back when

145
00:07:59,841 --> 00:08:03,830
he was like on top of the world and I was
like, Nah, I don't, I don't really know.

146
00:08:03,831 --> 00:08:07,640
And then I saw him live and I was like,
oh I get it. I see why people love this.

147
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,980
And then I went back and heard
the bits and it was great.

148
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:14,120
But having never heard him or,
or, or, or uh, seen him live.

149
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:16,160
I don't know how people can
understand his jokes cause cause he's

150
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,420
so fricking physical. Yeah.
Some of it is a, it's hard,

151
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:22,720
but some of the earlier stuff
wasn't nearly as physical. Like,

152
00:08:22,721 --> 00:08:23,590
so there was some stuff,

153
00:08:23,591 --> 00:08:28,240
I've heard his stuff on like
Sirius satellite radio and
it translates. Yeah. Okay.

154
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,990
I mean I just, different
beds. Yeah. You know,

155
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,490
for a while he was getting like
super crazy physical with shit,

156
00:08:33,491 --> 00:08:37,300
but he's also doing 15,000 fucking
scene of arenas. Yeah. You gotta go,

157
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,650
you gotta get big. But this was at
like an improv where you know, there's,

158
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:44,020
there were like 150 people.
Yeah. Who preparing for it.

159
00:08:44,021 --> 00:08:46,480
He does those theaters in the round two,
which is interesting.

160
00:08:46,481 --> 00:08:47,890
I've only done that a couple of times.

161
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,580
I did like the stage spins
I did in Phoenix. Um,

162
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,150
celebrity theatre. Yeah. I've done it
twice in Phoenix and Phoenix is, it's

163
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,390
interesting because,
uh,

164
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:02,520
that celebrity theater is as big circle
and that's where Kat Williams got in

165
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:06,900
trouble. That dude where you know, the,
he was, the guy was like fuck America.

166
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,840
And he was like, Fuck America Sarah.
Remember that, that whole thing.

167
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:13,800
And everybody was mad at him for telling
this Mexican guy that how great America

168
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:14,700
was and shit.

169
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,500
Who's heckling stories
when he goes to cities?

170
00:09:17,501 --> 00:09:21,630
We're just an Ontario doing comedy and
be like, one guy guy's like, oh he won't.

171
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,070
He pulled a gun on him and the other
guy is like, oh no, that's not true.

172
00:09:24,071 --> 00:09:26,200
What the fuck are you saying?
Have we had a cross reference?

173
00:09:26,201 --> 00:09:29,560
We had to bring people in together. Did
Clark, who's the guy who runs a place?

174
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:34,330
I go, did Kat Williams put a gun on you?
And he's like, no, we'd put a gun on me.

175
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:38,020
Like it got crazy. And then like, and then
we had to go back to the first time. Oh,

176
00:09:38,021 --> 00:09:38,831
that's what I heard.
I go,

177
00:09:38,831 --> 00:09:42,850
he can't just scope saying a guy
pulled a gun on how my man cat man,

178
00:09:42,851 --> 00:09:47,020
just going around [inaudible] I want
to hear the stories I haven't heard yet

179
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:49,350
from like Dayton, Ohio,
where he fucking, you know,

180
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:52,310
ate a guy's ass out or something.
Boy,

181
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:56,560
Brian Cowen making stuff up
now. He's silly. Fuck no,

182
00:09:56,561 --> 00:10:00,250
but there has to be stories that just
never made it in a TMZ that was in the

183
00:10:00,251 --> 00:10:02,620
weed store that was in
the weed store once,

184
00:10:02,621 --> 00:10:05,080
and Cat Williams assistant came
in and she announced herself.

185
00:10:05,081 --> 00:10:09,430
So I'm Kat Williams, I'm Kat Williams
assistant. I'm here to pick up his weed.

186
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,180
She was getting weed for Kevin.
Welcome to America.

187
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:17,320
Welcome to California where
your assistant can go to a,

188
00:10:17,321 --> 00:10:19,920
we chop and just announce hello.
And you go in there,

189
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,980
you announce yourself properly.

190
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:25,510
This

191
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:29,410
girl. So yeah, it was
interesting. But anyway,

192
00:10:29,411 --> 00:10:32,440
that's theater in the round.
That's a, that's a smaller place.

193
00:10:32,441 --> 00:10:35,830
The one where cat was that I've been
at that place, it's like 2,500 seats.

194
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,950
Dane's doing that shit with, it's
like 18,000 people. Same goal.

195
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,240
Like what is that? That's so
bizarre. People eat that shit up,

196
00:10:43,241 --> 00:10:47,410
but it's like really?
It's so cultive personality when it,

197
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,780
when it was really hitting what
people didn't like about it.

198
00:10:49,781 --> 00:10:53,650
What a lot of comics who were upset about
the true reason is that he had packed

199
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:56,830
somehow another tapped
into this boy band thing.

200
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,530
So he hit this boy band
energy with common,

201
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,880
like this big boy band energy
like no one had ever done before.

202
00:11:03,881 --> 00:11:05,350
Like backstreet boys shit,

203
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:10,210
where girls would go and fucking scream
to meet Dane Cook and he hit that

204
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:10,781
somehow or another.

205
00:11:10,781 --> 00:11:14,260
He tuned into that frequency for a little
while and I don't know how the fuck he

206
00:11:14,261 --> 00:11:15,600
did it. He just, you know,

207
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:20,200
he just was the perfect energy and the
perfect planning mean you've got to give

208
00:11:20,201 --> 00:11:22,510
the guys is his props for
figuring that all out.

209
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,450
But that's what bothered comedians
because they knew that there was just like

210
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:29,750
boy band thing going on. It's almost
gimmicky. Yeah. Without it being gimmicky,

211
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,780
she did it all himself.
It's not like, you know,

212
00:11:31,781 --> 00:11:36,460
Dick Clark productions put together some
comedian and taught them how to dress

213
00:11:36,461 --> 00:11:38,500
and then foisted a month
to the American public.

214
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:41,830
Like what happens with a lot of music
acts, you know, they construct them.

215
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,330
You know, I mean it's, it's funny how
it's so open in the music community.

216
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:46,700
You know,

217
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,140
like our friend Eddie Bravo has had a
whole bunch of looks throughout his life,

218
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:53,680
music career with his long hair
or whether it's, you know, it's,

219
00:11:53,681 --> 00:11:56,980
it's funny how like people like in the
music industry it's like, you know,

220
00:11:56,981 --> 00:12:01,070
this is our band and we only wear
leather when we take pictures. You know,

221
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,600
it's like the, the idea of like
projecting an image, you know,

222
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,980
it's very much just accepted.

223
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:11,760
It's funny how a lot of them overused the
same looks cause they all use the same

224
00:12:11,761 --> 00:12:15,360
photographers to make like,
like album covers. Like a
lot of them are all similar.

225
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:18,990
So like I was looking at some like just
an unknown bands recently and I was

226
00:12:18,991 --> 00:12:20,790
looking at their, their,
their promo shots,

227
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:24,210
like their headshots and they're all
like sitting in like window sills,

228
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:25,740
like outside of factories.

229
00:12:25,741 --> 00:12:29,520
Like looking off at each other backwards
and like the one singing that's looking

230
00:12:29,521 --> 00:12:30,354
down at his shoes.

231
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,830
Yeah.
He's on the railroad tracks.

232
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,000
How many fucking people who are supposed
to be moody of taking pictures by the

233
00:12:36,001 --> 00:12:39,480
railroad trucks, you know, like
Chaz Christ. We get it. Yeah.

234
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,360
You're just going to get on that
train and ride out of nowhere.

235
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:46,830
You're just going to disappear on us.
You're such a crazy rebel at any moment.

236
00:12:46,831 --> 00:12:51,200
You're going to light a cigarette,
take a puff and hop on the train, man.

237
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:56,080
Yeah, those album covers, dude, you could,
you could put a hold blog site together.

238
00:12:56,081 --> 00:12:59,350
Just every asshole has ever done that.
Why? You're looking away and all that.

239
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:00,970
Sending in window sills.

240
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:05,010
Guess what? The dude who's kneeling in the
front, he does not want to be kneeling.

241
00:13:05,011 --> 00:13:06,810
He wants to be standing
up just like the singer,

242
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,770
but the singer's is not going to think
I show you the one who stands up and

243
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,690
talks.
You're the tambourine player man.

244
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:17,420
So tamarind players got to take
this like gangster slouch people,

245
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:20,310
I'm going to take me seriously in this
band unless I get down and if you're a

246
00:13:20,311 --> 00:13:23,130
tambourine player, you have to have like
thumb rings and Shit. You have to work,

247
00:13:23,131 --> 00:13:25,890
brings in your thoughts.
You have to be extra cool.

248
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:29,730
You know those banjo players that have
like a little pick on every finger.

249
00:13:29,731 --> 00:13:33,020
You ever see that?
That's what they do every,

250
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:36,690
they have claws like damn talents.
Yeah.

251
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:40,320
They have those weird ones that like
the connect to their fingertips,

252
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:43,840
like metal kitty cat claws and they all,

253
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,720
they all have that piercing from the
belly button that goes down to it,

254
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:49,230
like their nipples and stuff.
For a lot of musicians,

255
00:13:49,231 --> 00:13:52,800
it really is like trying
to get you to notice them.

256
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,190
There's like four other guys
on stage sweating it out.

257
00:13:56,191 --> 00:14:00,720
I'm just standing here with this fucking
base. Yeah. I need something shiny.

258
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,500
They figured kiss,
figured it out the best.

259
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,980
Just have a whole fucking character show,
have a show,

260
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:10,830
you know everyone's wearing makeup.
You're blown firing into the crowd.

261
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:14,180
Yeah. It's the same makeup
too. It's not like a mixture.

262
00:14:14,181 --> 00:14:18,380
I mean pretty much it's just black and
white and I can't tell the difference of

263
00:14:18,381 --> 00:14:20,120
who they are, what their, their makeup on.

264
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,100
I've been to a lot of concerts in my life.

265
00:14:22,101 --> 00:14:25,550
The greatest concert I've ever
been to ever was a kiss concert.

266
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:30,070
I've been to a bunch of kiss concerts
because my uncle used to work for kiss in

267
00:14:30,071 --> 00:14:34,640
the early seventies so I was, yeah,
I was a little kid. I was like, fuck.

268
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:38,000
I was like maybe six years old
the first time I met ace freely.

269
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,330
Was this like your first concert or
you're like just the best concert and it

270
00:14:41,331 --> 00:14:43,820
just happened to be when you were
five or six years old? Well, no,

271
00:14:43,821 --> 00:14:47,300
just you know those and then I
saw them again with Kevin James.

272
00:14:47,301 --> 00:14:49,370
Kevin James is a big kiss freak too.

273
00:14:49,371 --> 00:14:50,930
And he and I went to see
them two nights in a,

274
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,780
in the 90s when they made
that comeback tour. Yeah.

275
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,700
Here's before neither one of us,
you know,

276
00:14:55,701 --> 00:14:58,670
I think maybe I've just gotten on
news radio and Kevin, you know,

277
00:14:58,671 --> 00:15:01,100
nobody knew who Kevin was yet.
And uh,

278
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:05,540
we went to see kiss to ninth and a fucking
row. We went to see it. It was awesome.

279
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:05,901
It's good.

280
00:15:05,901 --> 00:15:09,830
It's fun to see a band like consecutively
like that and change up the show.

281
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,840
They came back to,
this is the real kiss.

282
00:15:11,841 --> 00:15:15,600
It was like Peter Criss and ace freely
with them, which had never happened.

283
00:15:15,601 --> 00:15:19,010
But we like for years they did like the
band had broken up and there was this

284
00:15:19,011 --> 00:15:21,920
Vinny Vincent Guy and his other,
a bunch of other guys that came in.

285
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,430
But essentially the,

286
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,470
the only two guys that was constant where
Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley and then

287
00:15:27,471 --> 00:15:31,280
this was like the big tour and having
him back again, it was just so fun.

288
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:32,960
It's like,
it's so much,

289
00:15:32,961 --> 00:15:36,700
there's so much involved as like nostalgia
cause he songs that like, you know,

290
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,980
they're singing songs from Detroit,
rock city,

291
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:43,450
this thing had songs from like 40 fucking
years ago or whatever it was, you know,

292
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:48,020
that the time 30 years ago. And
they're still, they're not fat yet.

293
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,850
They're still wearing makeup and their
dance read like they look like they're

294
00:15:50,851 --> 00:15:53,660
still their characters. It's
where it works, you know,

295
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,540
they're really still can put on
a fucking good show. So there's,

296
00:15:56,541 --> 00:16:00,800
so it was so much involved and how
they all died in that plane crash.

297
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:05,630
What Gene Simmons is getting married,
if you've seen that shit. Yeah. Yeah.

298
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,920
How long was he with his,
uh,

299
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,650
it was going to be his wife of
28 years or something. Crazy.

300
00:16:09,651 --> 00:16:13,700
Lindsay Lohan is going to be
in playboy for $1 million.

301
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:18,740
Who pays for this? You, it
should be just like, dude.

302
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:22,640
So we need to say them aside and be like,
look, no one cares about that at all.

303
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,470
This is sort of,
I don't think you're right though.

304
00:16:24,471 --> 00:16:27,650
I think this is sort of the model
that he's based his entire career on.

305
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:31,370
It's like do something sensational
woman. No, won't see a broken woman.

306
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:35,270
Everybody wants the American
woman's ass hole. She's naked. Yeah.

307
00:16:35,271 --> 00:16:39,320
If I can just see her asshole. Just the,
just the hint of it in the distance,

308
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:43,070
but mostly concentrate on the vagina. Even
if the vagina lips are closed, which I,

309
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,990
except with playboy,
you have to accept.

310
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,420
You have to accept they won't get all
gynecological. I would take Brittany,

311
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:53,990
Brittany's asshole Britney Spears over
Lindsay and I would like to see Lindsay

312
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:57,860
Lohan photograph drunk. That's what I
want to say. I want to see real drunk,

313
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:01,520
not fake drunk, real drunk. And
when she goes to the real, yeah,

314
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,670
no,
I'd be really interested in those photos.

315
00:17:04,671 --> 00:17:08,630
I'd really interested if you could get
photos of her in her element. Obviously.

316
00:17:08,631 --> 00:17:11,300
Look, I have nothing
against Lindsay Lohan. Okay.

317
00:17:11,301 --> 00:17:15,560
She seems like a girl who's just looking
to have fun. She seems a girl who, yeah,

318
00:17:15,561 --> 00:17:19,130
maybe she's partying a little bit,
but you know what? Guess what?

319
00:17:19,131 --> 00:17:22,100
It probably wasn't too fucking easy
growing up on the Mickey Mouse Club and

320
00:17:22,101 --> 00:17:25,460
being in the limelight when you were a
child and all your developmental years

321
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:28,670
and with your parents, people would take
it fucking photos of your all the time.

322
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,060
Your Dad's fucking nuts to me. Totally
say the girls just having a good time.

323
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,490
I want to see if she's going
to take pictures naked.

324
00:17:34,491 --> 00:17:37,200
It should be watching as having a
good time, which the ankle bracelet.

325
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:42,170
She get high, she should get high. She
should do a bump. Drink a couple of shots,

326
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:45,290
you know, and then show me your
pussy. Let's see what's up. Those,

327
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,080
those should be the pictures,
the Lindsay Lohan pictures that we get.

328
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,980
I don't want to see that airbrush cropped

329
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,180
out bullshit where she's pretending
to get on a fucking Polo Pony.

330
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:58,890
[inaudible] hanging out of her
pants. But this is, I mean,

331
00:17:58,891 --> 00:18:02,430
obviously a total PR moves,
so people who are kind of managing the PR,

332
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:06,570
this won't ever let that happen and
that's disappointing. Yeah, those dummies,

333
00:18:06,571 --> 00:18:08,730
they don't know what they're doing.
They're doing it the wrong way.

334
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,050
What they should do is embrace it. You
know what? He should embrace what you are.

335
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:14,910
That's what brought you to the dance.
Lindsay.

336
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:17,790
Little hands is nothing wrong with that
girl. She's a freak. She's a freak.

337
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:18,840
She's not hurting anybody.

338
00:18:18,841 --> 00:18:20,850
She's not out there clogging
people's fucking eyes out.

339
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:24,060
She's just getting fucked up. She's got
millions of dollars. It was 24 years old.

340
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,770
What do you want her to do?
What do you want it to do?

341
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,100
You want her to take yoga classes?
We didn't want it to,

342
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:32,280
not everybody's going to be fucking
mother Theresa. You know this curly bad.

343
00:18:32,281 --> 00:18:35,760
She's just out there probably sucking
in some decks, getting cooked up,

344
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:39,700
getting fingered in the bathroom. She's
fucking, she's putting it together. Yeah.

345
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,280
It's called together an exciting little
life. Join her twenties she never see.

346
00:18:43,281 --> 00:18:48,090
See, when I asked her if she
wanted to Fart in Katy far
cup, when I asked her, no,

347
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:52,980
you asked her. You actually, you harassed
her. What a piece of shit you are,

348
00:18:52,981 --> 00:18:55,110
Bro. No, no. Poor girl.
It's pretty awesome.

349
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:59,290
Okay. You're going to
like this if it works. And

350
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,270
Brian, all right, here we go.

351
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,580
Hey Lindsey. Lindsey. Oh my God. Do you,

352
00:19:12,581 --> 00:19:15,400
have you ever farted in a cup and put
it in the cat space just to see its

353
00:19:15,401 --> 00:19:16,234
reaction.

354
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,250
What about what about puppy?

355
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:27,700
That's not really true.
You added all that shit.

356
00:19:27,701 --> 00:19:32,690
Ain't [inaudible].

357
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:37,700
You already told me how you did,
but knucklehead joke for everybody.

358
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:42,580
Everybody tried to pull it over my eyes
and maybe watch a gag from four fucking

359
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:45,970
years ago. That wasn't even real. It's
real. [inaudible] tell you what he did.

360
00:19:45,971 --> 00:19:46,631
Ladies and gentlemen,

361
00:19:46,631 --> 00:19:50,230
he added his audio into the
previous audio of Lindsay Lohan.

362
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:54,790
This is a fucking fraud perpetrated
on the American people. It's fine.

363
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:59,810
It's fine. And it's funny, but you
already did the bit on the podcast. No,

364
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:03,450
but you did it to Joe.
I was doing it to America.

365
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:07,000
I knew disrespectful man. Yeah,
he's fucking tried to trick me, man.

366
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:12,030
The good thing is that people think that's
real and now the really good thing is

367
00:20:12,491 --> 00:20:15,400
they don't know until you ruined it.
I ruined it.

368
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,340
I wanted to know what Lindsay
Lohan thinks about that video.

369
00:20:18,341 --> 00:20:22,180
I think that would be hilarious to
see stuff. She already asked me that.

370
00:20:22,181 --> 00:20:25,000
It's a stupid question she wants.
We thought it was a stupid question.

371
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,550
It's got 7,000 users a chance to,
you seen it?

372
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,210
Yeah, man. That's everybody.

373
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:37,600
That's a youtube is going to make you
a partner. There's a fucking videos,

374
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,480
some videos online. If you look
at and you go, Whoa, how many?

375
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:42,970
I finally started watching Zeitgeists.

376
00:20:42,971 --> 00:20:46,030
There's a new site guys to film that
everybody tells you you have to watch.

377
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,980
So I finally started it.
I looked

378
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,890
down to views,
11 million views.

379
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:53,880
Right, and when was it uploaded?
Do you know how fast that came?

380
00:20:53,881 --> 00:20:55,710
Good question because that stuff,

381
00:20:55,711 --> 00:20:59,250
I mean there's like a formula almost.

382
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,950
I got a couple of buddies who are
like youtube partners and they just,

383
00:21:01,951 --> 00:21:05,610
I mean it's ridiculous.
Once people start subscribing to you,

384
00:21:05,611 --> 00:21:07,590
they'll just watch anything
and they just throw up shit.

385
00:21:07,591 --> 00:21:11,020
It doesn't matter just because they need
to put more content out there and you

386
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:13,410
know that that part of it suffers,
which sucks.

387
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:18,560
Dude is only a bloated in January of
2011 so I guess it's been around for,

388
00:21:19,141 --> 00:21:20,790
what is that, six months? February. March,

389
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,620
yeah, but when did you watch
this? A couple of months ago.

390
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:27,650
It's secret is black woman on toilet
equals 38 million hit black Raymond on

391
00:21:29,491 --> 00:21:31,650
toilet?
No.

392
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:36,270
Was that the woman who was like
smacking her lips and singing some

393
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,450
crazy Dee Siggy type

394
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,343
black ones

395
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,550
and this woman looks like she's got a

396
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,720
Bandanna on her head

397
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,540
and she's morbidly obese.

398
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,860
I think she really is sitting on
the toilet too, which is cool.

399
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:12,020
It's not funny. Wow. This is,

400
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:14,730
this is one of those things.

401
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:21,750
What about wiping a dirty bitch?

402
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:26,760
I had a buddy who sent me that and I
watched about 10 seconds of it when this

403
00:22:26,761 --> 00:22:30,570
chick's like trying too hard to be viral
and I'm pissed that she became viral.

404
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,180
Yeah.
Read a lot of hydro,

405
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:36,570
38 million people married and she would
have sped up her voice like times two

406
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:40,900
that would have made 80 million hits.
He has to do is setting up.

407
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,140
That's what you do.

408
00:22:45,141 --> 00:22:48,200
And if you were an alien and you
were from another planet and you were

409
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:50,930
evaluating Earth and whether or not
the earthlink should be allowed to move

410
00:22:50,931 --> 00:22:54,830
forward, he would look at things like
this and you would go, wait a minute,

411
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:57,920
what the fuck? They'd probably wasted
all their resources. Let's move on.

412
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:02,020
I might get one of the real housewives
of Beverly Hills checks to come on this

413
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,260
podcast.
This is Rogan is friends with one of them.

414
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,950
I can't say until we, until she says
yes. But that would be fascinating too,

415
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,420
because it was another perfect example.

416
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,420
I need to be a watch that could show
Joe. It's fucking, it's unsafe. Feeling

417
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,093
uncomfortable.

418
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:23,810
Yeah. And they, um, they're,
it's real gross man. Did the,

419
00:23:23,811 --> 00:23:28,080
like the level of behavior, especially
the Beverly hills one is real gross.

420
00:23:28,081 --> 00:23:32,520
They're just disgusting human
beings. Yeah. These women are foul.

421
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,390
I haven't seen this new season.
Have you been watching it this season?

422
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:40,100
I just watched one episode, the one
that misses Rogan's friends in the,

423
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,140
they are so fucking,
yeah. These women are,

424
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,580
they're ugly and doing drugs.

425
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:50,300
Girl keeps running to the bathroom and
doing drugs and she's coming out and

426
00:23:50,301 --> 00:23:50,471
they're,

427
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:53,810
they're mean to this pretty girl and
they're mean to this pretty girl for no

428
00:23:53,811 --> 00:23:57,500
reason. I mean, she doesn't do a damn
thing and they think it's hilarious,

429
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,490
but they're being mean to her.
You know why?

430
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:02,020
Because when you're a woman and if you're,

431
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,960
you're an an unattractive woman and
another woman is really attractive,

432
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:08,480
all of the sudden it's like
she stole something from you.

433
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:13,430
It's like she has this magical power just
to have some fucking roll of the dice.

434
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:17,480
And so they feel like it's okay to
be contrary to them because the woman

435
00:24:17,481 --> 00:24:21,140
actually makes them feel like
we're already at a deficit
before the conversation.

436
00:24:21,141 --> 00:24:22,970
Even starts,
they feel uncomfortable,

437
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:27,500
so they don't feel bad about turning that
uncomfortable feeling on the girl for

438
00:24:27,501 --> 00:24:30,540
no reason at all. Right. Just for
the girl being pretty and it's,

439
00:24:30,541 --> 00:24:32,180
it's crazy to watch,
man.

440
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:35,780
It's crazy to watch these like
really low level human beings,

441
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,670
like low level thing catty.
Yeah. It's worse than caddy.

442
00:24:39,671 --> 00:24:44,100
It's just worried about is who's fucking
who and whose bag is who wearing and

443
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:48,080
where do you get your shoes and
low and they're monsters, man.

444
00:24:48,081 --> 00:24:50,090
They're just just retard monsters.

445
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:53,400
I watched all of last season
and I don't know why, but oh I

446
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,830
did you feel like, did you see
the guy committing suicide coming?

447
00:24:57,831 --> 00:24:58,670
Did you see that coming?

448
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,370
No,
but he was a little weird.

449
00:25:00,371 --> 00:25:04,030
He was just kind of off and the
way his wife would describe him,

450
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:05,470
she was saying like,
oh,

451
00:25:05,471 --> 00:25:09,520
he's a manly man and he's like a cowboy
and he's just muscular and all this shit.

452
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,700
And he just looks like a dude who sits
in a cubicle. I mean, I know he didn't,

453
00:25:12,701 --> 00:25:15,280
but he looks like he's never been at
the gym and his life. But you know,

454
00:25:15,281 --> 00:25:18,880
it wasn't like a fat tub of Shit, but he
was just all right. And I was just like,

455
00:25:18,881 --> 00:25:20,380
this woman has blinders on,

456
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:24,250
you know? Yeah. Well, so I
think some people, you know,
they sit down, they go, well,

457
00:25:24,251 --> 00:25:26,950
how are you going to talk about
me? Well, I'm going to say that

458
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,660
love wildlife. How are you
going to talk about me? Well,

459
00:25:31,661 --> 00:25:34,510
I'm going to say that you're a
manly man. Tell people, meet you.

460
00:25:34,511 --> 00:25:35,980
And they're like cowboy

461
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,170
pull balls down by the,

462
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,610
that wasn't even a plot point. And one of
the episodes they were, they were like,

463
00:25:42,611 --> 00:25:44,220
wait,
she described him as there's like,

464
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,590
there's mainly cowboy and he's
just like a balding piece of shit.

465
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,460
Yeah. You know what? The producers
would probably smacking their lips.

466
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,300
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

467
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:55,650
That's a good way to describe on the
way to describe him. But I like to wait,

468
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:00,550
we've met this guy. Make sure
this gets to the year fast enough.

469
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,720
If there's any words that slurry, just
make her do it again. Do it again.

470
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:09,250
That's called, she had like major, major
botox. Dude, I don't think it's a botox.

471
00:26:09,251 --> 00:26:10,600
I think it's actually an implant.

472
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:11,880
Oh really?
Well,

473
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,710
she was constantly going in and
getting more plastic surgery done.

474
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:19,270
Oh, jumps and stuff. And She
just looks ridiculous. Yeah.

475
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,810
They start fucking with her face man.

476
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,920
And it's way better to look old and
they look crazy and women don't want to

477
00:26:24,921 --> 00:26:27,770
accept that. But there's, I
know women, they need to stop.

478
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,160
I know women that have become monsters.
I mean literally become monsters.

479
00:26:31,161 --> 00:26:32,570
I've seen them become monsters.

480
00:26:32,571 --> 00:26:37,571
I've seen them change from
this very nice older woman,

481
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:38,780
you know,

482
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:42,770
it's just accepting the fact that she's
entering her forties or 50s or whatever.

483
00:26:42,771 --> 00:26:44,160
And this just life,
the cycle of life

484
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,590
for all of us. There's other things
to concentrate other than that.

485
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:50,580
And instead they just
whacked her face out, man.

486
00:26:50,581 --> 00:26:55,470
I mean whack it out with like fillers.
So their cheeks stick out. Right.

487
00:26:55,471 --> 00:26:59,810
And then they get, they get their noses
change and their eyes pulled back.

488
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:05,010
Well, the duck lips freaking the fuck
out there. Like w w what are you doing?

489
00:27:05,011 --> 00:27:05,844
What is this?

490
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,450
It's almost like people thought that
because you were allowed to have duck lip,

491
00:27:09,451 --> 00:27:13,510
tits, those blah, that's
fucking stupid tits.

492
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:18,000
We not only like, they were
encouraged like buck mom, nobody,

493
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:21,900
nobody went, you know, you've ridiculous
bitch. But if you go duck lips on the,

494
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,500
on the lips, then we go get outta
here. You can't go super balloons.

495
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,090
You can go super balloons on the tits,

496
00:27:27,091 --> 00:27:30,260
but you can't go super balloons on
the lips. People drew a line there.

497
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,970
They're like, this is creepy
to tits. I can go with,

498
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:36,420
it's past the point of being funny and
it's just sad. Yeah. And ridiculous.

499
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:40,050
But it's more disturbing.
Like for whatever reason,

500
00:27:40,051 --> 00:27:43,860
fake breasts don't bother me nearly as
much as fake lips. Fake breasts seem like,

501
00:27:43,861 --> 00:27:46,830
yeah, I see what you did there and you
know you want him to bigger ones. Okay,

502
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,350
cool. That's cool. But fake
lips are like, whoa, Whoa, whoa.

503
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,360
That's your fucking mouth man. You
know, like you're, you're, you're,

504
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:57,390
you're jabbing some shit into where you
sit and eat to change the shape event.

505
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:01,860
Do you look at the before and afters?
Is anybody looked better with that shit?

506
00:28:01,861 --> 00:28:04,350
Especially the eyebrows when they
started fucking with the eyebrows too.

507
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:06,660
Like people that shaped who much also.

508
00:28:06,661 --> 00:28:08,790
And then there's people
that get those teammates.

509
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,790
At least your eyebrows grow back. That
doesn't bother me. But the tattoos.

510
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:15,740
Have you seen the tattoos?
Cat eyes and eyebrows. I,

511
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:18,450
I'd rather not do permanent
makeup too with a tattoo.

512
00:28:18,451 --> 00:28:22,110
Like eye shadow on shit like that.
I don't like that Shit's weird.

513
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:27,420
Like a clown person.
That's a commitment man.

514
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:30,240
Who's got bits about the tattoo
on your face? It doesn't.

515
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,200
One of our friends have a bit about
tattoo on your face. Is it team?

516
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:38,390
Does team have been about tattoos
on his phone? Hey Thompson girl.

517
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:41,370
So Gurra has bits about guys
with tattoos on their face.

518
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:45,150
One of the guys on our board,
it's a stupid fucking picture,

519
00:28:45,151 --> 00:28:48,900
but it makes me laugh every time I see it.
This guy a non on the message board,

520
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,050
he has this,
uh,

521
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:55,010
this photo of a dude who had
tattooed on his lip pussy eater it,

522
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,800
and it's a mugshot of this guy.
I hate the Mugshot of this guy.

523
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,430
And he's kept pussy eater
tattooed on his lip.

524
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:07,380
Can you imagine being there
and carrying that? I could. Oh,

525
00:29:07,381 --> 00:29:11,190
he cares, man. That's why
he did it. Doesn't not care.

526
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:16,020
It's abuse, Bro. Somebody
abused that kid for sure. Yeah.

527
00:29:16,021 --> 00:29:20,010
That's a kid that grew up in a terrible
environment. That's what that is.

528
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,370
I got a buddy who's got a, you know
those name tags that say like, hi,

529
00:29:23,371 --> 00:29:26,300
my name is Tom,
or whenever it's got to as just he's,

530
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:30,810
he tattooed that on his chest when he
was drunk and Mexico and so it was that

531
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:33,060
and it says, hi, my name is Dildo tron.

532
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:39,720
Here's the best part. The Mexican dude
given him the tattoo misspelled Dildo.

533
00:29:39,721 --> 00:29:44,320
Toronto does says Delo. Oh,
to go back and get it fixed.

534
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:48,850
Oh, that's hilarious. That's so beautiful.

535
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,270
That's so beautiful. It's
ridiculous. So much better that way.

536
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:56,230
That's so much better. There's some
hilarious misspelled tattoos online.

537
00:29:56,231 --> 00:29:58,330
If you want to just,
just laugh your fucking ass.

538
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,620
Just go and look at some of the shit
that people have misspelled on tattoos.

539
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:05,530
It's like, my God. Fuck man.

540
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:09,100
Do you just not care at all?
Do you do not double check?

541
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:12,340
I'm pretty sure it's how it's spelled,
but let me check real quick.

542
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,690
That's why he just try not to get any
writing. Just do that. You can't have

543
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:19,030
design like that will. You could
always say, oh well then no,

544
00:30:19,031 --> 00:30:21,460
that octopus was supposed
to have nine tentacles.

545
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:24,090
Especially if you do
like to Betten language.

546
00:30:24,091 --> 00:30:27,030
Like I have a friend who was this big
Tibet and piece across his stomach like

547
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:28,630
come on Sunday,
can't read Tibet.

548
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,780
Know what the fuck does
that really says?

549
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:35,930
That can say some ridiculous shit.
Like what is your say you you,

550
00:30:35,931 --> 00:30:37,710
you got a tattoo.
You thought it said Brian.

551
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,870
I thought it was the letter R and I found
out it meant what are flowing water or

552
00:30:41,871 --> 00:30:46,871
waterfalls and he blames crying fits
in that Tattoo under my lip right here.

553
00:30:49,731 --> 00:30:52,640
I thought it said, you know my
last name and it says cum bucket.

554
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,733
Are you doing bitch?

555
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:01,850
He felt like he was setting us
up there twice, twice, twice,

556
00:31:01,851 --> 00:31:02,800
twice today.
Brian,

557
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:05,600
you try to sneak something in
there is that there's a porn star.

558
00:31:05,601 --> 00:31:07,010
It has the word cum bucket.

559
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,100
And that's what I was thinking about it
because she had a Twitter the other day

560
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:12,080
and she was looking at like
her lips and as a company,

561
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,080
that's disgusting. I just,
some girls just say, all right,

562
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:20,170
you want to play slot? All right,
I'm going to play super slot. Right.

563
00:31:20,171 --> 00:31:23,930
They just take it out.
Like when you watch those gang bang scene,

564
00:31:23,931 --> 00:31:27,130
so you watch gang bang scene and like,
you know, they get together and they go,

565
00:31:27,131 --> 00:31:28,450
all right,
and how many want to do all right,

566
00:31:28,451 --> 00:31:31,730
what we're gonna do 300 today and
they'll do a 300 man gang bang.

567
00:31:31,731 --> 00:31:34,810
And then another girl go, that
bitch, she had 300 I'll fuck her.

568
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:36,400
I'm going to do 150 more.

569
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:40,030
And so she'll do the fucking four 50 and
then some crazy bitch to 600 but that's

570
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:42,970
what they do. They just outside
each other they get instead,

571
00:31:42,971 --> 00:31:46,420
since they can't be pure and loved and
they can't be accepted for who they are,

572
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,510
instead they just go deep,
deep into the slut barrel.

573
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:54,420
Brad, you know Brad Williams,
he was dating. Yeah, the
little, uh, the little guy,

574
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,540
he was a,
he was telling me that he was like,

575
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:02,460
he had been like fucking this porn
star. Whoa for a while. And then she,

576
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:04,980
you know, and this is going
on for two years or something.

577
00:32:04,981 --> 00:32:08,810
And then she comes to him
and says, listen, we've got
to stop and this and that.

578
00:32:08,811 --> 00:32:12,570
I'm getting out of the business. And he's
like, oh, is that just like what you do?

579
00:32:12,571 --> 00:32:14,790
Like when you stop, you just don't want
to do when she goes, well, you know,

580
00:32:14,791 --> 00:32:17,340
I want to be faithful
to my husband with like,

581
00:32:17,341 --> 00:32:20,550
this whole time you've been having this
two year affair with this porn star.

582
00:32:20,551 --> 00:32:24,150
Didn't even know, Whoa, maybe
I shouldn't have said his name.

583
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:29,210
Well,
see Shatsky these chicks,

584
00:32:29,211 --> 00:32:30,044
these chicks,

585
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:33,190
you know, it goes back
into, you know, I'm gonna,

586
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:38,180
I'm gonna fuck 150 more guys. I'm going
to go fuck dwarfs or whatever. You know.

587
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,620
Well, you know, I mean I'm,

588
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,930
I'm a shitty arm chair psychologist,
you know, and I want to,

589
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:47,970
when I break down porn stars and like
why does a person do this and does a

590
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,910
person do that? There's different reasons.
There's a lot of different reasons but,

591
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:55,190
and some of them are really nice, like
Danny, the Armand, she's really nice.

592
00:32:55,191 --> 00:32:56,950
Jenna Jameson's running
nice, you know, some,

593
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:01,490
they're really nice people
but I can't help. But when,

594
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:03,950
you know, especially since
I have daughters of my own,

595
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,930
whenever I seen something like that,

596
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:10,910
that there's this weird part of me
that has to do the math, you know,

597
00:33:10,911 --> 00:33:15,160
I can't just watch a girl with a Dick in
her mouth and wandering around assault

598
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:18,230
and one in her vagina. I can't
go. Wow. They must be crazy.

599
00:33:18,231 --> 00:33:21,070
Like this bitch is just
letting go and just wild.

600
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:25,940
I have to do the math in my
head has to go back to puberty.

601
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,440
It has to go back to
child and that's the girl.

602
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:30,710
What the fuck happened to you
that you're expressing yourself?

603
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:34,160
This word is your bond.
It's really like fucking sex like a lot,

604
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:37,610
like it feels so good and you just gave
up me like, you know what? Fuck it.

605
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,260
I liked the fuck it is possible.
But you know,

606
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:44,000
all all varieties of behavior
are possible, I guess.

607
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:48,590
Supposedly friends with her family.
No, nothing's ever happened to her.

608
00:33:48,591 --> 00:33:50,120
She's just a good example.

609
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:55,160
Dana Dermo now that she's a very
strange girl. Yeah. You know she did.

610
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,640
She did a gang bang scene and afterwards
she was so happy about it that she was

611
00:33:58,641 --> 00:34:03,170
crying. It was an awesome video. Just the
trailer alone. Totally legit. Awesome.

612
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:07,890
Totally legit. She's just crying
because she accomplished awesome senior.

613
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:12,470
No that. I love them. I love
them all and it's like, whoa.

614
00:34:12,471 --> 00:34:16,190
Like for everybody else he watching you
go, wow, what the fuck? But she's nice.

615
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,040
She's a nice person. He's going to bring
a tear to your eye because you know her.

616
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,260
No,
not quiet before.

617
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,740
It's one of those Arsenio
Hall things that make you go,

618
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:31,310
you
remember that was a song for a while,

619
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,750
D and c music factory.
Is that what it was?

620
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,100
I wonder if they took that from
Arsenio Hall and I think it was,

621
00:34:37,101 --> 00:34:37,934
I think it was the whole,

622
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:41,840
I think they ripped him off or was
either or the other backwards. Oh,

623
00:34:41,841 --> 00:34:45,590
it could've just been like a same
time period though. Cultural thing.

624
00:34:45,591 --> 00:34:49,020
Like they're just like a phrase
that people, you know, in that time,

625
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:52,210
Arsenio Hall show that
never fell off like that.

626
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:57,360
I would've loved to see that guy continue
his talk show ways like Jay Leno's

627
00:34:57,641 --> 00:35:00,240
done like everybody else has done.
I liked the Arsenio Hall show.

628
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:05,460
He's a nice fucking guy and he
lives, he lives, uh, and, well,

629
00:35:05,461 --> 00:35:06,460
I don't want to say where it lists,
but I've,

630
00:35:06,461 --> 00:35:08,920
I've run into them a bunch of times
and he's always super friendly.

631
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:12,050
I keep hearing he's trying to
make a comeback or something
and then I never hear

632
00:35:12,051 --> 00:35:14,230
anything about it at anytime.

633
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,670
I hear his name is always trying to get
things in order because he's going to do

634
00:35:16,671 --> 00:35:17,990
a comeback and then you
just don't hear anything.

635
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,160
Well, he was doing standup
for a while, you know,

636
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:21,960
he came to the comedy
store a bunch of times.

637
00:35:21,961 --> 00:35:23,910
Do you remember it came to a comedy store?
Yeah.

638
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,460
Well we saw him at the comedy Magic Club.

639
00:35:25,461 --> 00:35:26,870
We hung out with him and
then got in the green room.

640
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:30,950
Yeah, I'm really, yeah,

641
00:35:30,951 --> 00:35:35,000
it was like maybe two years ago. Three
years ago. Really? Yeah. He's a great guy.

642
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:37,130
Either way. Um, he's um,

643
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:41,460
I don't know why the fuck did we get
on to him? Oh, things make you go home?

644
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:43,853
It's called dead air.

645
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:45,040
No,
that shit.

646
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,450
Do you remember how they used to portray
or sending a hold on like Saturday

647
00:35:47,451 --> 00:35:51,230
night live with that really long finger,
like, yeah, like this creepy long finger.

648
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,690
Oh, remember that? Remember that?

649
00:35:53,691 --> 00:35:57,760
Was that Sarah and I think it was
Saturday night live in living color. Oh,

650
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:58,660
did you hear about it?

651
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:02,740
This a high school, uh, drug
bust that they pulled today.

652
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:04,650
And can I saw you,
I saw you tweeted that,

653
00:36:04,651 --> 00:36:06,210
but I didn't get a chance to look at it.

654
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,920
Fucking ridiculous. One of
the most ridiculous things
I've ever heard in my life.

655
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:14,690
They told these kids that is
in Connecticut and um, Walcott,

656
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,230
Connecticut did this, this happened today.
No, I'm sorry. They reporting it today.

657
00:36:18,231 --> 00:36:19,380
It happened last week.
Oh,

658
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,410
so they say that the over the loudspeaker
that an intruder has entered the

659
00:36:24,411 --> 00:36:26,850
building, they think it's
a shooter. You know, they,

660
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:30,920
they implied that they think that there's
some armed person who has entered the

661
00:36:30,921 --> 00:36:35,600
building that everyone needs to get into
a corner and huddle up and then they go

662
00:36:35,601 --> 00:36:39,350
through the fucking high school with
drug sniffing dogs looking for pot.

663
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:41,580
That's ridiculous.

664
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:45,600
So they scared these fucking kids into
thinking that there was a shooter and

665
00:36:45,601 --> 00:36:48,480
they're building now they don't
know the history of these people.

666
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:51,960
What if one of these kids was related
to someone who got shot at Columbine,

667
00:36:51,961 --> 00:36:53,670
right?
Or many of those other schools shootings.

668
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:56,790
And you're going to give some
horrible trauma to some fucking kid.

669
00:36:56,791 --> 00:37:00,010
Who remembers their uncle Mike who
got shot in the fucking hammer?

670
00:37:00,011 --> 00:37:02,190
They did that then because their comments,

671
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,550
because morons run the school
systems in Walcott, Connecticut.

672
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,190
So they send dogs through
the fucking in the hallways.

673
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:11,670
They find no drugs by the way.
They find nothing. Meanwhile,

674
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,370
these fucking kids now are going to think,
oh,

675
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,910
they're willing to lie to us for
a shit reason. They're not even,

676
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,590
they're not even going to ask us,
do you have drugs?

677
00:37:19,591 --> 00:37:23,070
And then search to the school
unexpectedly. Instead of doing that,

678
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,800
what they're going to do as a lie
to us about a fucking shooter,

679
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:29,340
about an armed intruder,
get us terrified now,

680
00:37:29,341 --> 00:37:31,560
how the fuck are you ever going to believe
them if they come on the loudspeaker

681
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:34,910
again and say an armed intruder is
entered into this tool at fuck you was,

682
00:37:34,911 --> 00:37:39,180
it really was an army. God Damn. Fuck
you. Yeah, you're right. Fuck you.

683
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:42,270
When I was in high school that were
like, you know, it's probably more today,

684
00:37:42,271 --> 00:37:46,830
but like 10 dudes you knew did, you know
did did pot and stuff and that was it.

685
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:49,170
It's like,
I'm sure most high schools are like that.

686
00:37:49,171 --> 00:37:53,130
Like you know who the fucking pot
heads are just like corner them or so.

687
00:37:53,131 --> 00:37:55,470
You don't have to lie to the
entire school freak everyone.

688
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,830
You don't have to lie to them either.
If you want to search the fucking school,

689
00:37:58,831 --> 00:37:59,820
search to school,

690
00:37:59,821 --> 00:38:03,690
tell the kids to sit the fuck down and
put the dogs in the hallway and you know,

691
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,090
make sure you have the dogs on leash.
You fucking savages.

692
00:38:06,091 --> 00:38:08,840
So no little kids get
bitten. But the, the disease,

693
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:12,990
this is whose idea it was like the
superintendent or the principal or,

694
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:16,650
I mean there's should be multiple
firings for this firings.

695
00:38:16,651 --> 00:38:19,920
They should go to jail. You
guys are criminals, criminals,

696
00:38:19,921 --> 00:38:21,570
and you're fucking up a kid's brain.

697
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:23,940
You're going to make kids
think the cops are idiots.

698
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:26,020
You're going to make kids
think the cops won't,

699
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:28,680
will lie to you to find out if
someone's smoking a fucking joint.

700
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:32,970
It's all high school.
Jesus fucking Christ.

701
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:37,900
How will you raising your 15 1617 year
old kids do not talk to them. Yeah,

702
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:41,560
you could do your fucking talk to him at
that age. They're fucking teenagers, man.

703
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,180
There are a lot of fucking
smarter than you think.

704
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:47,170
What you don't do is lie to him and
see there's a fucking shooter in the

705
00:38:47,171 --> 00:38:51,630
building.
It's just so bad.

706
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:55,690
Associate or Duke Walcott,
police department.

707
00:38:55,750 --> 00:39:00,580
You can't dumb dumb,
dumb cunts.

708
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,370
Did you fucking think
this shit through at all?

709
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,360
It's just one of the things where it
makes you just really realize that there's

710
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:11,920
no special qualifications to be in
charge of a situation like this.

711
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:16,510
To be that guy who comes up with that
Shitty fucking idea and then implemented

712
00:39:16,511 --> 00:39:20,770
without anybody stopping him. Right.
Damn. How the fuck do you trust them?

713
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:26,050
You Morons not one teacher go, wait,
whoa, whoa. What the fuck are we doing?

714
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:29,500
But not one cop go. What?
What you want? I mean,

715
00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:32,800
I know cops just want to keep their
fucking job and keep the fucking pension,

716
00:39:32,801 --> 00:39:35,980
but when your boss tells you that
you got to be like Jesus Christ,

717
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:38,710
we're going to bring dogs to the fucking
high school and you're going to tell

718
00:39:38,711 --> 00:39:41,770
them that there's a shooter.
Well, I mean it's doubtful,

719
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,480
but maybe the cops didn't know.

720
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:46,510
Maybe they said you just get the kids
off in one area and we'll come through

721
00:39:46,511 --> 00:39:48,910
with the, yeah, there might be. Yeah,
there might be more to that story.

722
00:39:48,911 --> 00:39:51,160
Like the cops had no idea what
they were doing. You know,

723
00:39:51,161 --> 00:39:54,410
like they were just like what? There's
a gun really. This is the exact note,

724
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:57,250
the school administrator and now it's
over the public address system that a

725
00:39:57,251 --> 00:40:01,750
dangerous intruder had entered the school
and that all students were to remain

726
00:40:01,751 --> 00:40:06,751
in their classrooms away from windows
and ideally huddled in one corner of the

727
00:40:06,851 --> 00:40:07,330
room.

728
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:12,330
They had the kids huddle in fear huddle
in one corner of the room for nothing,

729
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:17,620
for our fake drill. Cause I'm a fucking
moron, cop and Walcott, Connecticut.

730
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:21,220
And I think I'm smarter than people
because they have to listen to me cause I

731
00:40:21,221 --> 00:40:24,640
have a badge because they
operate under a system of law.

732
00:40:24,641 --> 00:40:28,720
These fucks these fucking cops and
they get into these situations, band,

733
00:40:28,721 --> 00:40:31,360
they start thinking they're
better than regular people there.

734
00:40:31,361 --> 00:40:33,520
Start thinking they can
tell you what to do. What?

735
00:40:33,521 --> 00:40:35,590
I will just tell them
there's an intruder jets.

736
00:40:35,591 --> 00:40:38,750
Why you're the boss always
with the great ideas

737
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:44,980
chief. How do we get all these kids to
huddle in the corner? Terrified in fear.

738
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:49,260
Well, denim, there's a Nandan Truda. Oh,

739
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:52,930
that's why you get all the big tax
dollars. We're paying this guy.

740
00:40:52,931 --> 00:40:57,790
We're paying this cunt to lie to our kids.
You fucking dummy.

741
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:01,690
What a disaster of a human being.
You. If I've got the day off,

742
00:41:01,691 --> 00:41:03,130
you need me to come in. Yeah, come down.

743
00:41:03,131 --> 00:41:06,700
We're gonna scare the shit out
of some kids. Show up with dogs.

744
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:11,500
We're going to look for joints.
You fucking cunt. You just useless.

745
00:41:11,501 --> 00:41:13,960
I think it was coke. If it was
coke, it'd be okay if they were,

746
00:41:13,961 --> 00:41:17,980
even if it was coke, man, look, all
of it. Anything. You know, even pot,

747
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:19,510
if you're this pot
going around the school,

748
00:41:19,511 --> 00:41:22,780
you've got to find out where the fuck
at pots coming from kids, 14 year olds,

749
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,320
he'd be a lot harder than it is
to get pot. I agree with that.

750
00:41:26,321 --> 00:41:28,600
I don't think it should be high
all through fucking high school.

751
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:32,550
It can ruin you and ruin your motivation.
You're not developed. Yeah, you're not.

752
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,360
You're not fully a human being
yet. There's these, there's a way,

753
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:40,280
but there's ways to handle it that don't
get kids terrified of Jack boot thugs

754
00:41:40,281 --> 00:41:43,940
for the rest of their fucking lives and
lies the lies that the people that are

755
00:41:43,941 --> 00:41:45,860
in control are going to tell you,
no matter what,

756
00:41:45,861 --> 00:41:49,880
you're always going to question those
kids that experienced this will always

757
00:41:49,881 --> 00:41:53,060
question any official
announcement now forever. Right?

758
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:56,870
It's impossible for them not to write
and they'll have this story forever.

759
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:01,040
They will laugh about this store. They
should sue the fuck out of those people.

760
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:04,750
Yeah, and I know it's a down economy and
I know that, you know, there's no Melissa,

761
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:08,960
this is shit we're suing over. Not
Frivolous lawsuits you get all the time.

762
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:11,990
This is where it's soon over. If
that was my kids, I would fuck you.

763
00:42:11,991 --> 00:42:16,940
I would sue sue the fuck out of that
police department and I love cops.

764
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:20,750
It's not the cops themselves. It's,
I know this is the work of one dummy.

765
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:23,680
You have to find that dummy.
You'd find that dummy.

766
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:25,010
You need to move him to Siberia.

767
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:28,060
Thought he was going to win an award or
something for some sort of, you know,

768
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:29,690
drug task force bullshit.

769
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:35,170
My new model might not be an edge. As
we came and I came up with a great idea,

770
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,180
score shoot or fish, Judah,
everybody's game, finish school.

771
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:44,000
It's fucking idiot. Running around
running a police department,

772
00:42:44,001 --> 00:42:47,510
fill of grown men with guns and
this is what he tells you to do.

773
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:51,170
What a piece of shit you dumped.
Fuck, I wish I knew your name.

774
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,600
They don't list the name it and how could,
how could they not?

775
00:42:53,601 --> 00:42:56,840
Listen to me a better officer. What do
you need to do is do mushrooms? Well,

776
00:42:56,841 --> 00:43:01,040
you need to do officer is just
get alone in the woods is good.

777
00:43:01,041 --> 00:43:02,360
As long as you know there's no bears,

778
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:05,270
you know you're not going to be freaking
out while you're in the middle of your

779
00:43:05,271 --> 00:43:08,750
peak, right? Just do some
mushrooms. Now Find Yourself,

780
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,750
find how bad this idea was and
if you're scared of mushrooms,

781
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:13,940
eat one of those pop brown
is that you confiscate.

782
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:19,820
If you're not prepared, he two or three
pot brownies. If you're not prepared.

783
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:24,140
That's just as bad as it was doing
mushrooms that will introduce you to your

784
00:43:24,141 --> 00:43:28,280
flaws. You know they have to
to to eat those already. Right.

785
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:29,970
That's I'm sure if they do a drunk bus,

786
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:32,930
probably just going to burn all that
weed or like dispose of it in one way,

787
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,710
but it's a Brownie. Yeah.
Yeah. I mean they're good.

788
00:43:35,711 --> 00:43:37,640
They're going to be munching
on that on the way home. Well,

789
00:43:37,641 --> 00:43:39,830
you can obviously you can
just say it's a Brownie.

790
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:42,390
You know it doesn't look like contraband.
Right? What's that? That's Brownie.

791
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:45,140
My wife pack went my lunch
there was black and brown.

792
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:48,680
Did you ever hear that video of the cops
are called nine one one because they

793
00:43:48,681 --> 00:43:51,950
had stolen some pot brownies
from this kid and ate them.

794
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:55,160
I guess they stole a pot and then cook
them into brownies and then ate the

795
00:43:55,161 --> 00:43:57,980
brownies and I think that's a story.
Either way,

796
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:02,210
the most important part was they were
calling nine one one they were cops and

797
00:44:02,211 --> 00:44:04,520
they're calling nine one one. They were
like, I think we're going back in time.

798
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:09,170
I don't think that really, I think I
might already be dead like they were.

799
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,390
They were thinking they were already dead.

800
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:15,320
Like did they were so high
that they were like, oh my God,

801
00:44:15,321 --> 00:44:18,410
I have passed into the great beyond that,
I'm just starting to realize it.

802
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:22,070
So they were calling essentially the
nine one. One in the great beyond, right.

803
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:26,400
They were calling as cops.
Hilarious. So funny. Yeah.

804
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:29,240
This cop needs to party with
those people. Yeah. Right.

805
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:32,220
Just get your shit together,
Dude. The are you doing man?

806
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:37,230
I'm in war right now with Wikipedia.
What's, yeah, it's impossible. I,

807
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,670
there's been so many people,

808
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:42,180
like I have tried to make me a Wikipedia
page and then it gets canceled cause it

809
00:44:42,181 --> 00:44:45,330
says I'm not important enough.
Which I agree. That's fine,

810
00:44:45,331 --> 00:44:47,910
but then you look who else is
on there and you're like, wait,

811
00:44:47,911 --> 00:44:51,660
this person's on air because they f they
were a porn star for a month, you know,

812
00:44:51,661 --> 00:44:56,280
or this person, it's like a notator
ship over there, man. It's so fucked up.

813
00:44:56,281 --> 00:44:58,530
Right. And so that there's
all these, there's all this,

814
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,040
well there's all this controversy about
these people that kind of are like the

815
00:45:02,041 --> 00:45:05,930
head editors and no one, you know,
it's, everyone can edit Wikipedia.

816
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:07,930
So it's all about the people.
It's like the moderator. Yeah.

817
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:11,880
But there's like these moderators that
they want to put who they think is

818
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:16,410
important enough to be put in there. So
you go through this and you're like, wow,

819
00:45:16,411 --> 00:45:21,030
this is where you wanted there just for
promotional purposes. Do you want there?

820
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:23,490
I W I want it there because, well, one,

821
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:25,740
one of the things I want to be
is because Siri and all this,

822
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,490
all these technologies are incorporating
Wikipedia into it. So yeah,

823
00:45:29,491 --> 00:45:32,540
it's it for search reasons
and for what I do, it's, it's,

824
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:34,770
it makes sense to be in Wikipedia.
Right.

825
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:37,760
And then the other reason is
because then I look at, uh,

826
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:41,250
who's in there and I'm like, that's
makes sense. They have a Wikipedia.

827
00:45:41,251 --> 00:45:45,450
I should have a Wikipedia just for
as a kind of a quick bio, you know?

828
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:50,030
So when people are like, who the fuck is
Hilton? Have a Wikipedia course? And so,

829
00:45:50,031 --> 00:45:54,720
so what, you're sort of a many,
many, many Paris Hilton. So,

830
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:59,670
so I'm at some asking the p one of
the moderators or editors or whatever,

831
00:45:59,671 --> 00:46:02,280
and I'm like, you know, like what do
I have to do? And they're like, well,

832
00:46:02,281 --> 00:46:04,880
you need to send links of like your work.
Uh,

833
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,910
like on other websites or other
publications or who you are on other

834
00:46:08,911 --> 00:46:12,210
publications that are linked. So I'm
sending them like on Sirius Xm radio,

835
00:46:12,211 --> 00:46:16,970
they talk about our podcast page. It's
probably, they listened to the podcast,

836
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,090
right? I know what it is. And
you're like trying too hard.

837
00:46:21,091 --> 00:46:22,710
So then they have the power.
I know.

838
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:27,750
So I'm thinking about being in a
porn movie just to be in Wikipedia.

839
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:31,030
It's a good move. And wiki
leaks what you're doing. See,

840
00:46:31,031 --> 00:46:33,960
your girl wants to start branching out
into male porn and you're resisting and

841
00:46:33,961 --> 00:46:37,220
you'll say, well, I'll just fuck you and
it'll kill two birds with one stone. Sure.

842
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:40,500
It'll get me on Wikipedia and you can
do boy, Girl Porn. I make more money.

843
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:43,180
That's right. So I think it's
my transition and getting a wig.

844
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:47,250
I won't fire you.
There's some jobs will,

845
00:46:47,251 --> 00:46:49,920
they'll fire you if they catch you
doing born. I'll tell you right now,

846
00:46:49,921 --> 00:46:52,230
you can go do all the porn you
want and I will never fire you.

847
00:46:52,231 --> 00:46:56,160
It was a part of your job growth at it.
You're free to do mourn.

848
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:59,460
You might get a hundred
percent job security. You
don't have to worry. I got it.

849
00:46:59,461 --> 00:47:02,730
I got a buddy who is an attorney,
he's an attorney and he moved,

850
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:06,330
he moved from Phoenix to La. Oh,
just to work in the office out here.

851
00:47:06,331 --> 00:47:09,750
He was living with a guy
who created a big TV show,

852
00:47:09,751 --> 00:47:12,300
but I don't want to say what it is, but
everybody would know what it is. Bonanza.

853
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:14,430
And he was living with a
guy who created bonanza.

854
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:20,850
And so he's a lawyer and a, and then
the guy, he's living with his like, Hey,

855
00:47:20,851 --> 00:47:22,590
do you want to come and do a
little guest spot on my show?

856
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:26,400
This is like a reporter, right? And
he's just asks two questions. It's some,

857
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:30,550
some little guest star thing. And,
uh, so what I put on Wikipedia,

858
00:47:30,551 --> 00:47:33,350
I make a Wikipedia page for him just
as like a joke. Like, oh, Brandon,

859
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:38,230
Lombardy is a American actor. And
uh, but he's also a lawyer. He,

860
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:42,100
he, this thing is taunting him now. I've
tried to take that off several times.

861
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:44,680
You can't, like, you can't take it
off him and take that. I'll delete it.

862
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:48,220
It'll be back within an hours because
he'll, he's like trying, you know,

863
00:47:48,221 --> 00:47:50,830
he's like interviewing for other jobs
and stuff at different law firms.

864
00:47:50,831 --> 00:47:53,590
They're like, well, what the fuck is it?
You're an actor. Like what? And he's like,

865
00:47:53,591 --> 00:47:57,430
no, no, no, no. They look, I mean,
he's on IMD be and that sort of thing,

866
00:47:57,431 --> 00:48:00,050
but it's like he,
that's not who he is and it's,

867
00:48:00,051 --> 00:48:03,310
it's like starting to fuck with them. Like
they're tyrants over there, dude. Yeah,

868
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:04,173
it's weird.

869
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:07,540
There's some kind of like government that
runs we Wikipedia and they want you to

870
00:48:07,541 --> 00:48:09,010
know who they want you to know.

871
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:13,050
Almost like the media where it should be
an open source thing. Like it's rolled,

872
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:17,050
you know it. And it's really fucking
weird because if you can say, hey,

873
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:20,110
like I gave them a link list of links,
like 50 pages,

874
00:48:20,111 --> 00:48:23,530
like how many Twitter followers do you
have now you're like 30,000 but I was a

875
00:48:23,531 --> 00:48:26,680
guest on Adam Carolla radio show about
the Carla's been see a video I, you know,

876
00:48:26,681 --> 00:48:28,540
have,
have little things that are,

877
00:48:28,541 --> 00:48:30,820
I would gay more important
than somebody that is like,

878
00:48:30,821 --> 00:48:33,190
I was in a blowjob video when I was 18

879
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:36,370
the blowjob video provides a lot of
people with something to beat off to.

880
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:38,440
You think it should be knocking it?
Like what's,

881
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:43,370
what's Charlie Sheen's girl that crazy
that his ex that day, the crazy slide.

882
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:46,210
Her name.
What's the Olson?

883
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:50,920
She is the most beautiful fucking
Wikipedia page with photos and lane.

884
00:48:50,921 --> 00:48:54,700
She's a superstar though. She's a
porn superstar. Compare yourself

885
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:57,820
to her. That's ridiculous.
That's what I'm saying.

886
00:48:57,821 --> 00:49:00,130
I'm just know what you
will never be hurt if you,

887
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:03,880
you know what you are and you're the
guy who confidently says, you know,

888
00:49:03,881 --> 00:49:07,780
like if you have to choose to treat me or
fucking Bree Olsen, you'll let me live.

889
00:49:07,781 --> 00:49:09,790
I know you will.
I don't even have to think about it.

890
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:12,280
And then it gets to the judgment
time when the guy was like,

891
00:49:12,281 --> 00:49:17,080
I'll take Brielle's and what the bottom
falls out of the floor and he drops down.

892
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:17,990
He just doesn't understand.

893
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:23,600
He just wants some legitimacy. He just
wants to affirmation for what I do,

894
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:28,220
what I do, my videos and, and Margaret.
It helps promote stuff. It's pretty,

895
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,770
it makes more sense to me that that's
like my being not being able to be on I

896
00:49:31,771 --> 00:49:34,670
MDB for you probably imagine.
You know, it's kind of like that.

897
00:49:34,671 --> 00:49:36,380
It's kind of like a Techie,
nerdy.

898
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:39,310
I got,
what else?

899
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:41,980
What else I get is the fact that you've
had it up a couple of times and then

900
00:49:41,981 --> 00:49:43,180
somehow or another it gets yanked back.

901
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:44,670
Yeah.
It's because it's,

902
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,120
they always give the excuse that you're
not important enough or you're not

903
00:49:47,121 --> 00:49:48,980
showing importance at all.

904
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:50,710
I send them a link,

905
00:49:51,310 --> 00:49:55,000
30 different things like article
reviews and stuff like that.

906
00:49:55,001 --> 00:49:56,440
He listens to this podcast.

907
00:49:56,470 --> 00:50:01,300
I fucking guarantee you he listened to
these podcasts. He's one of those guys.

908
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:03,340
It's fucking red being Nazi.

909
00:50:03,341 --> 00:50:06,870
Every time we bring this up is another
six months of me not adding it.

910
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:11,140
Tired of red pens. Bullshit. Nobody
wants to hear about your cats Dick.

911
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:13,550
He's going to Applebee's on the weekends.
Just bitching.

912
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:14,790
Anyone who will hear and will be,

913
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:20,010
did I tell you I've got the craziest
Internet search story other ever.

914
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,910
There was a store,
I've told this before,

915
00:50:21,911 --> 00:50:25,930
I think this is the the 1990s like right,

916
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,060
right around 2000 ish.
There was a

917
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:32,450
small mixed martial arts organization and
it was when they were just starting to

918
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:35,870
learn about Internet searches and they
had this guy who was fighting for them

919
00:50:35,871 --> 00:50:38,330
and he's got, he's got,
he's a fucking beast dude.

920
00:50:38,331 --> 00:50:41,600
Like six four two 40 built like a,

921
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:45,620
like a comic book superhero smashing
everybody and he was like a big star and

922
00:50:45,621 --> 00:50:47,360
their organization,
so a,

923
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:51,890
they're trying to assemble some press on
this guy and they do a search and they

924
00:50:51,891 --> 00:50:55,650
find out that a gentleman with the same
name had won something called the hungry

925
00:50:55,651 --> 00:50:57,120
is but contests.

926
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:05,003
So

927
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:07,350
pre Google man,
this is like,

928
00:51:07,351 --> 00:51:09,570
who knows what they had for
search engines back then.

929
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:14,160
So clearly this couldn't be our guide,
this couldn't be our gladiator,

930
00:51:14,161 --> 00:51:17,850
our warrior and not be involved in
something called. So they click a link,

931
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:22,380
there's two dudes using him as Chinese
finger handcuffs, one's in his ass,

932
00:51:22,381 --> 00:51:26,670
ones in his mouth and they got these
pictures of this guy, oh my God.

933
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:29,250
And so then my friend has
to sit down with this guy,

934
00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:33,320
talked to him and he has
to say, uh, you know, um,

935
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,070
did you ever do gay porn?

936
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:40,160
Which is the guy fucking freaks out and
starts yelling, what the fuck you saying?

937
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:41,550
What the fuck are you saying?

938
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:45,630
And he has to literally click on the
link and then step away from the computer

939
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:49,620
while it loads. And he's like, and the
fucking few seconds and it took to load.

940
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:54,610
I'm locked. He goes, I'm locked in a
fucking office with a gay savage, right,

941
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:59,040
right. Big Day gladiator who is
lying to me and tell me he's not gay.

942
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:02,790
And I'm clicking this link and as it's
click, click, click, click, click, click.

943
00:52:02,791 --> 00:52:06,060
It's old school internet where it takes
a long time for a personal loan and

944
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:10,950
slowly but surely he sees the Dick in
his mouth like slowly but surely you see

945
00:52:10,951 --> 00:52:14,490
men's abdomens mag, men's
abdomens, someone's head,

946
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:19,790
your head, what's in your mouth?
Oh, that's a car once in your ass.

947
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:22,200
That's a cocktail and you,
you're watching this

948
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:24,830
and he's watching this. They're
watching this together. You know,

949
00:52:24,831 --> 00:52:27,830
they're watch this together. And then
the guy says, listen man, listen man.

950
00:52:27,831 --> 00:52:30,920
I just needed the money. It's not
that I'm gay. I just needed the money.

951
00:52:30,921 --> 00:52:34,100
It was just a bad situation.
It turns out he did like a hundred movies.

952
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:38,810
Oh Shit. You can do like 15 movies.
That's a lot of money though.

953
00:52:38,811 --> 00:52:42,390
I'd take her money movies. That's
what's a lot of money though, for fee.

954
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:43,430
How much worse?

955
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:46,250
It wasn't getting paid back then as
compared to what you would get today too.

956
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:49,010
Yeah. The joke is when I
talked about it in my act,

957
00:52:49,011 --> 00:52:50,510
the joke was how much does
a lot of money to you?

958
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:52,910
Cause for a lot of money
to me is I do one movie.

959
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:56,000
I live like I'm in a fucking Jz
video for the rest of my life.

960
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:58,790
They did 15 you should have
all the money on a planet.

961
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:01,530
There should be no money left for
anybody else. You have everything.

962
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:04,970
You did 15 movies where we,
they like, man, fuck you.

963
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,800
You got everything and great memories

964
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:09,150
do, do, do, do.

965
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:12,050
How pissed off are you Brian
that I have a Wikipedia page?

966
00:53:12,051 --> 00:53:14,420
I already know you'd already looked.
Oh goodness.

967
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:18,730
I looked it up because it's kind of you
coming off a little jealous. No, no.

968
00:53:18,731 --> 00:53:22,560
I looked it up. I looked it up
actually when I was trying to get, no,

969
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:26,040
trying to get photos for you for the
show we did last week and it came up

970
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:30,060
as on when I did a search
and I, he, he's in a TV show,

971
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:33,210
so you should be on, have a
Wikipedia show. But I didn't,

972
00:53:33,211 --> 00:53:35,550
I don't know how it got made or how,
I mean,

973
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:38,010
I would imagine my own voice if they try,

974
00:53:38,011 --> 00:53:40,740
if they verified it
that I was on that show.

975
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:42,840
The way that you're saying they do that,
I don't know why they're not.

976
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,930
There's gotta be something else
as a reason why they're not like,

977
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,390
I know. I think it's because I'm
German. Josh has his own website.

978
00:53:51,391 --> 00:53:56,220
Josh mcdermitt.com. What a handsome fella.
Hey, can I plug my Twitter? Fuck yes,

979
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:59,130
dude. This is what I like. Anytime
you say anything about me on Twitter,

980
00:53:59,131 --> 00:54:04,110
I pick up like a hundred followers like
that. Please follow Josh McDermitt, m c d.

981
00:54:04,111 --> 00:54:08,330
E r M. I t. T. Derm myth to be,

982
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:11,400
it used to be fat piece of crap,
which is easier to remember.

983
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:13,000
How can we change it?
Uh,

984
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:16,610
cause people who pay me a lot of money
asked me if I would change it so they get

985
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:20,250
promoted and I just kind of went, this
isn't a fight I want to have. I was like,

986
00:54:20,251 --> 00:54:24,470
sure, whatever. But I still have fat piece
of crap so don't try and get it. But um,

987
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:29,190
this is what I'm going to do. Cause uh,
uh, no, this is kind of little plug.

988
00:54:29,191 --> 00:54:31,740
If I could put,
November,

989
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:35,400
November is pancreatic cancer awareness
month and my brother in law died of

990
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,940
pancreatic cancer.
And so for every follower I get,

991
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:41,340
let's start it now through
the month of November,

992
00:54:41,341 --> 00:54:44,880
I'm going to donate 5 cents to
pancreatic cancer research. And I know,

993
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:48,300
I think I had like six 82 or
something when I walked in here.

994
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:52,470
So everything from now on, uh, through
November I'll donate 5 cents. Oh sweet.

995
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:54,570
That's pretty good.
I get all the money in the world,

996
00:54:54,571 --> 00:54:57,330
so I don't give a shit if I get a
million followers. Guys, you crazy.

997
00:54:57,690 --> 00:55:00,870
What's a million followers? 5 cents of
falling or know who can do the math,

998
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:01,823
not me.
You know,

999
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:04,830
there's someone listening to this right
now already who's already done it. Yes.

1000
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:07,830
Yelling it out. Killing [inaudible]
answer. Morons guy ain't talking.

1001
00:55:07,831 --> 00:55:12,420
I'm not Brian. We're going to get you on
Wikipedia buddy. It's going to be okay.

1002
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,770
We gotta do it, man. So
me and Joe were talking,

1003
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:17,280
we're still in the other day
talking about yawning and like,

1004
00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:19,500
like what the fuck is yawning for it?
And I was like,

1005
00:55:19,501 --> 00:55:23,070
what if there was some kind
of communication back in
the old days were we're not

1006
00:55:23,071 --> 00:55:26,040
figuring out.
And we went on this whole theory of like,

1007
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:29,250
like what if we yawned and touched
her nipples at the same time?

1008
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:33,480
Like a dragon head would come out and
teach us something or that was you not

1009
00:55:33,490 --> 00:55:37,800
wait, don't say we when you came
up with a stupid idea. So anyways,

1010
00:55:38,850 --> 00:55:39,683
last night it was

1011
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:47,060
last night was watching. What's that
show where they tried to break a myth?

1012
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:47,850
Myth busters.

1013
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:51,540
I was watching mythbusters and during
doing theory on yawns and it was so weird

1014
00:55:51,541 --> 00:55:54,130
that out of nowhere that I saw this,
uh,

1015
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:57,150
and they would put people
around in like groups.

1016
00:55:57,210 --> 00:55:59,940
And then like see if
like one person to yawn,

1017
00:55:59,970 --> 00:56:04,020
if it would start like a yawn off where
everyone would be yawning eventually.

1018
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:07,230
It was really interesting. There
was a, it wasn't a high number,

1019
00:56:07,231 --> 00:56:09,720
which I thought it was,
but there was definitely shown negative.

1020
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:13,750
You Yawn in a group that
there'll be more yards per, yeah.

1021
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:16,950
Well I think that that's a smart
way to test that. First of all,

1022
00:56:16,951 --> 00:56:19,740
you know they did a few ways you,
but that's a terrible way to test it.

1023
00:56:19,770 --> 00:56:22,560
When you have cameras on people
and you make no, they don't. No,

1024
00:56:22,561 --> 00:56:23,970
they don't know there's cameras.
They think that they,

1025
00:56:23,971 --> 00:56:26,740
they got him off Craig's list. They had
to fill out to like some application,

1026
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:29,440
like a doctor's waiting room. They
don't know there's cameras. Yeah. Yeah.

1027
00:56:29,441 --> 00:56:32,740
They didn't know there were, there was
cameras. Wait for someone to yawn. Yeah.

1028
00:56:32,741 --> 00:56:35,920
And they just waited for one person to
yawn and and see, see if it started.

1029
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:39,140
Do the, do people yawn? Like,

1030
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:43,660
or just like what if nobody dawned
than this? They had problems with that.

1031
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:46,330
So they didn't, they did other
studies where the gas, the room,

1032
00:56:48,650 --> 00:56:53,470
then they did you sign the release
where they put them in like their each

1033
00:56:53,471 --> 00:56:57,760
individual rooms and did studies on them?
It was just kind of weird because I,

1034
00:56:57,761 --> 00:57:01,120
while watching that I couldn't
stop yawning. You're like I was

1035
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:05,620
mentioning I'll, I'll
start yawning. Right.

1036
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:09,010
Even if you're talking about that makes
sense that they studied it that way.

1037
00:57:09,011 --> 00:57:09,761
I was so stupid.

1038
00:57:09,761 --> 00:57:12,930
I thought they just got everybody
that that's how I was studying.

1039
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:15,040
Get them all in the room.
Okay. You Yawn first.

1040
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:18,310
Shit doesn't work at all.

1041
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:21,510
But what if that was some
weird communication that
we're not, we're missing out.

1042
00:57:21,590 --> 00:57:23,560
Like you're supposed to yon
with the person next to you.

1043
00:57:23,561 --> 00:57:25,280
At the same time I'm like,
there's something there.

1044
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:29,560
I think they believe in chimpanzees.
It had something to do with, uh,

1045
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:34,590
with the Alpha position and with
like exchanging like empathy.

1046
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:39,100
Like, so when one person
yawns like you're almost like,

1047
00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:43,600
you feel like, uh, obliged to let
them know. Yeah, I'm tired too.

1048
00:57:43,601 --> 00:57:46,360
Cause you don't want to be like,
you're taught bitch, I'm wide awake.

1049
00:57:46,361 --> 00:57:49,060
I'm going to fuck your wife while
you're sleeping. You know there's,

1050
00:57:49,061 --> 00:57:52,780
there's a little something too.
It's like a communication thing.

1051
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:55,480
When you're young, your heartbeat,
I think it was 30% goes up,

1052
00:57:55,481 --> 00:58:00,481
30% rate and your lungs completely fill
up with air like and it does all this

1053
00:58:00,541 --> 00:58:02,110
shit when, when you, when you yawn,

1054
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:04,750
it also makes me also wonder if
there was something else there.

1055
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:08,680
Like you're sending a bolt of like you're
supposed to yawned at same time while

1056
00:58:08,681 --> 00:58:11,530
you want to talk to somebody else in
their head or something like that.

1057
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:16,890
Did they talk about what the fuck are you
charging? You're charging your battery.

1058
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:19,720
Did they talk about what your heart
rate dips too after you're done yawning

1059
00:58:19,721 --> 00:58:22,390
because you're, you're like
relaxing. I don't know.

1060
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:25,270
I feel like you almost like relax even
more than it would be less than what it

1061
00:58:25,271 --> 00:58:27,700
was when before he started
yawning. Yeah, that seems silly.

1062
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:28,930
Maybe it's waking you up.

1063
00:58:28,931 --> 00:58:31,070
I mean saying that your heart
jumps 30 beats per minute. I mean,

1064
00:58:31,071 --> 00:58:32,500
that's what happens when
you take a stimulant.

1065
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,710
Maybe like the idea of this big burst of

1066
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:39,880
this big burst of oxygen and
unusual fashion like that.

1067
00:58:39,881 --> 00:58:44,660
Maybe it sparks like an extra little pump
of blood flow that's supposed to like

1068
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:48,220
send, like send a signal. Come on guys,
let's wake up. Let's wake up. Come on.

1069
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:50,980
Because like, that's what a lot of people
do too when they're young. Like, oh, okay,

1070
00:58:50,981 --> 00:58:53,920
okay, okay, let's fucking
bear down. You know,

1071
00:58:53,921 --> 00:58:56,710
when someone like yawns and they're tired,
sometimes they'll do that.

1072
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,900
They'll be on the go,
I got to wake up,

1073
00:58:58,901 --> 00:59:01,570
I gotta wake up and then they'll like
fire up whatever you supposed to touch

1074
00:59:01,571 --> 00:59:05,770
like a pyramid at the same time.
[inaudible] on one side,

1075
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:09,640
blue monkey up your asshole
while you're eating a jellyfish.

1076
00:59:14,490 --> 00:59:17,320
I thought you guys like what ifs. I'm
just talking. This is the craziest,

1077
00:59:17,321 --> 00:59:21,980
what if ever, Brian, I'm so glad
you saw this through. So there's,

1078
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:26,540
um, there's some evidence that the justice
department is proposing new freedom of

1079
00:59:26,541 --> 00:59:30,920
information act rules that
allow the government to
influence of form the public.

1080
00:59:30,921 --> 00:59:33,680
That records do not exist.
Even if they do.

1081
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:36,050
So you know the freedom of Information
Act, you're supposed to be able to say,

1082
00:59:36,051 --> 00:59:39,890
Hey, is the records on, you
know, Blah Blah Blah, and
they're, they're supposed to,

1083
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:42,040
you know, in cases where it's not, I mean,

1084
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:45,990
I'm sure there must be some fucking
national security rules, right?

1085
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:50,990
That's mine son I file. You're going
to drink out of mind. I'm like, ill,

1086
00:59:51,110 --> 00:59:55,060
you want some of this?
Anyway, what they're saying is
they're allowed to lie real.

1087
00:59:55,150 --> 00:59:57,060
They're allowed to tell
you that. It totally, it,

1088
00:59:57,090 --> 01:00:00,590
it cancels out the whole reason of
having the Freedom Information Act. Yeah.

1089
01:00:00,591 --> 01:00:02,490
I mean it's like, it's, it's, so,

1090
01:00:02,550 --> 01:00:07,550
it's like there's no way to keep a tab
of all the creepy shit the government

1091
01:00:07,701 --> 01:00:10,190
does on a regular basis.
They tried to sneak through.

1092
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:15,050
It's like you have to read about this on
fucking wired.com which is where I read

1093
01:00:15,051 --> 01:00:18,410
about it. Somebody sent it to me on
Twitter. It's just, it's so gross.

1094
01:00:18,411 --> 01:00:19,221
It's almost like the,

1095
01:00:19,221 --> 01:00:22,790
the Justice Department is putting this
out now and doing that so they don't have

1096
01:00:22,791 --> 01:00:26,960
to talk about shit like that. Fast and
furious gun running thing. Yeah, exactly.

1097
01:00:26,961 --> 01:00:30,710
You know what I mean? They're like, ah, we
got to cover our ass retroactively. Yeah.

1098
01:00:30,711 --> 01:00:33,530
I wonder. I wonder. I wonder if
it's just another distraction,

1099
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:37,190
but it's gotta be everything. It seems
like everything is a distraction nowadays.

1100
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:39,920
It's so offensive.
It's so strange.

1101
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,740
It's like it doesn't,

1102
01:00:42,770 --> 01:00:47,150
it doesn't make sense that at this stage
of the game that people still think

1103
01:00:47,151 --> 01:00:50,810
that they can communicate with people
like this or they can just lie to you and

1104
01:00:50,811 --> 01:00:53,330
just tell you that they don't,
that files don't exist.

1105
01:00:53,330 --> 01:00:56,450
Even if they do like 30 40 years ago,

1106
01:00:56,451 --> 01:00:58,490
freedom of Information Act comes out.

1107
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:02,240
Nobody thinks anything of it because
how many people are actually going to be

1108
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:04,520
asking for it.
But now that everyone's a blogger,

1109
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:07,130
everyone's got their own
podcast doing stuff. I mean,

1110
01:01:07,131 --> 01:01:10,070
it's like anyone could get
that information and you
start really doing some

1111
01:01:10,071 --> 01:01:14,000
fucking damage. Yeah. Anyone can
get that information. We had,

1112
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:17,360
we had yon over when we were young,
had stacks of them used to, fuck,

1113
01:01:17,361 --> 01:01:20,630
I've got the documents,
I'll release Jones. Yeah.

1114
01:01:20,631 --> 01:01:23,810
He had the freedom of information
documents like wow. Yeah. But even,

1115
01:01:23,811 --> 01:01:27,250
even though I know, I know that I could
get my hands on, I still feel like, ah,

1116
01:01:27,290 --> 01:01:30,950
it'd be too much work. I don't know.
Is it, it's, I don't want to do it.

1117
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:32,450
I don't have the, I
don't have the, I mean,

1118
01:01:32,451 --> 01:01:34,640
you've got to sift through
millions of fucking documents.

1119
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:35,750
You ain't gotta be a 90 person,

1120
01:01:35,910 --> 01:01:38,090
but every now and then you
find something really crazy.

1121
01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:40,970
Like they found the operation
Northwoods document that was like,

1122
01:01:40,971 --> 01:01:45,300
they didn't find that until
fairly recently. That's the
one where the public, uh,

1123
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:45,800
the,

1124
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:50,630
rather than the army was planning on
having fake attacks on American civilians

1125
01:01:50,631 --> 01:01:53,180
and blaming it on the Cubans to
get us to go to war with Cuba.

1126
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:55,430
They were going to blow up a drone.

1127
01:01:55,431 --> 01:01:59,210
Jetliner they're going to send a
jet into the air and blow it up. Oh,

1128
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:02,690
my blame the Cubans for it and
get us to go to war with Cuba.

1129
01:02:02,691 --> 01:02:03,980
And the guy who came up with that.

1130
01:02:03,981 --> 01:02:06,380
Then when I moved to Connecticut
and did that thing at the school,

1131
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:10,130
I got another idea. Well,
the scary part about it,

1132
01:02:10,131 --> 01:02:13,470
it was signed by the Joint Chiefs of
staff and it was vetoed by candidates.

1133
01:02:13,471 --> 01:02:14,840
It's called operation Northwoods.

1134
01:02:14,841 --> 01:02:19,770
It's one of the creepiest documents
you'll ever read because it is 100% lock

1135
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:20,280
down.

1136
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:24,390
Solid proof that people in high office
think that way, that they really,

1137
01:02:24,391 --> 01:02:26,220
they were going to
attack American soldiers.

1138
01:02:26,221 --> 01:02:29,710
They were going to have armed Cuban
friendlies, attack, wan tot them,

1139
01:02:29,711 --> 01:02:32,370
obey attack American soldiers. They
went on fucking lob mortars. Yeah.

1140
01:02:32,610 --> 01:02:35,280
I mean they would killed, killed
kids who would kill, you know,

1141
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:38,220
soldiers like American soldiers.
They're not pushing this through,

1142
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:40,550
put it in over the everglades
or something where you know,

1143
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:43,350
it's just going to kill a couple of
crocodiles. The whole thing is disgusting.

1144
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:46,170
But the what's really terrifying,
it's like no one went to jail for that.

1145
01:02:46,171 --> 01:02:50,640
This is like, you know, this is, I believe
it was like 1962 somewhere around then.

1146
01:02:50,770 --> 01:02:54,030
Right. So it was right before Kennedy
was killed and nobody was, um,

1147
01:02:54,690 --> 01:02:55,770
nobody went to jail for that.

1148
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:59,460
If nobody went to jail for that and
there's no punishment for that kind of

1149
01:02:59,461 --> 01:03:02,790
corruption and that kind of, you know,
the mismanagement of the government,

1150
01:03:02,970 --> 01:03:06,090
then all that happens is it evolves,
everything involves things.

1151
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:10,020
They don't stay still. If they're
making five bucks a day under the table,

1152
01:03:10,021 --> 01:03:11,920
they want to make 10 bucks a
day under the table. You know,

1153
01:03:11,990 --> 01:03:15,780
it's a very few people stay at the
same level all the time, but that,

1154
01:03:15,781 --> 01:03:20,190
that document just feeds into why Kennedy
was assassinated, you know, probably.

1155
01:03:20,191 --> 01:03:20,941
Yeah.
Like with the,

1156
01:03:20,941 --> 01:03:24,900
with the Cubans and how he didn't want
to do the shit that the military sort of

1157
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:29,190
wave of people recently I find that don't
believe the Kennedy was assassinated

1158
01:03:29,191 --> 01:03:33,690
by anyone other than Oswald. And
I think it's hilarious. Yeah.

1159
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:37,040
It's one of the dumbest conspiracies.
It's one of the, if you know,

1160
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:40,920
w you go with a conspiracy theories,
there's, there's, there's, you know,

1161
01:03:40,921 --> 01:03:43,800
some that are really out there and you've
got to really squint when you look at

1162
01:03:43,801 --> 01:03:46,590
them. And there's other ones that go,
oh yeah, there's something wrong here.

1163
01:03:46,650 --> 01:03:48,450
And the Kennedy is, there's
something wrong here. Yeah.

1164
01:03:48,451 --> 01:03:52,200
If you just look at the facts,
you know that Oswald didn't do it.

1165
01:03:52,230 --> 01:03:56,510
He didn't act alone so much crazy shit.
The fact that they found the bullet on,

1166
01:03:56,570 --> 01:03:59,310
on the, um, what are those things
they carry by on the Gurney,

1167
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:03,030
they found the bullet on, on, on
Connolly's Gurney just magically fell.

1168
01:04:03,050 --> 01:04:05,760
Oh here's the bullet that shot
you and went through everybody.

1169
01:04:05,761 --> 01:04:07,760
And even though it's not even bent up,
right,

1170
01:04:07,761 --> 01:04:09,810
it's the whole thing is just preposterous.

1171
01:04:09,811 --> 01:04:12,330
And the only reason why they came
up with a third bullet, you know,

1172
01:04:12,331 --> 01:04:14,340
the reason why they had to
have that single bullet theory,

1173
01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:15,630
this is one thing a lot
of people don't know.

1174
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:17,700
It's cause there was a
guy under the bridge,

1175
01:04:17,701 --> 01:04:20,010
he was under the overpass
and he got hit by a ricochet.

1176
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:21,720
So they had account for that bullet.

1177
01:04:21,870 --> 01:04:24,630
And since they had committed to the idea
that there was three shots that were

1178
01:04:24,631 --> 01:04:28,140
fired from Oswald's gun, they had
account for all these different wounds.

1179
01:04:28,290 --> 01:04:32,730
One of them being a wound in the front
of the neck that in the initial autopsy

1180
01:04:32,731 --> 01:04:36,420
they diagnosed as a wound in the front
of the neck and then in Bethesda,

1181
01:04:36,421 --> 01:04:39,480
Maryland when they flew the body and
they said it was a trake wound and that

1182
01:04:39,481 --> 01:04:41,970
they opened up it to help him breathe.
Why,

1183
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:46,020
why are you helping someone brewery that
is missing their fucking head. Okay.

1184
01:04:46,021 --> 01:04:49,950
His brains got shot all over the
fucking backseat of that car.

1185
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:53,970
Stop pretending that that guy was alive
when they flew him across the continent

1186
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:56,690
and they stuck a trake wound. He
didn't know that's an impact, won't it?

1187
01:04:56,700 --> 01:05:00,300
So it's an entry wound from a bullet
and they can't account for that bullet.

1188
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:04,560
So all they came up with was,
oh well one bullet just went wiki,

1189
01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:09,390
wacky inside of his body and shattered
bones in two different people came out

1190
01:05:09,391 --> 01:05:13,290
looking almost pristine. It's, it's
amazing how few people believe that.

1191
01:05:13,291 --> 01:05:18,040
And it's because people like things
tidy and they like things and they love

1192
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:22,660
this idea of [inaudible]
razor. The simplest solution
is always the correct one.

1193
01:05:22,661 --> 01:05:26,410
But that's not the case. Oftentimes
it is. But it's not always the case.

1194
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:30,820
If you'd see in the operation Northwoods
document, there's real corruption.

1195
01:05:30,850 --> 01:05:32,620
There's your real conspiracy.

1196
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:35,290
There's a bunch of guys who
really sat down and said,

1197
01:05:35,291 --> 01:05:38,800
how can we get people to be interested
in going to war with Cuba? Well,

1198
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:39,700
here's what we can do.

1199
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:42,940
We can say the Cubans are attacking us
and we can blow up airplanes like the

1200
01:05:42,941 --> 01:05:45,670
fact that they would drop a memo for that.

1201
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:49,270
If you don't think they would get
together and say, this Kennedy,

1202
01:05:49,271 --> 01:05:53,170
this motherfucker, he wants us out of
Vietnam. It's going to cost us billions.

1203
01:05:53,290 --> 01:05:57,310
He wants to fucking end the Fed. He
wants to get rid of the CIA. The CIA.

1204
01:05:57,340 --> 01:05:59,620
At the time,
I'd only been around for about 20 years.

1205
01:05:59,950 --> 01:06:04,020
The CIA was created after World War II,
so from World War II to,

1206
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:08,560
you know when Kennedy was shot in the 60s
it was building up steam and he didn't

1207
01:06:08,561 --> 01:06:10,840
like it.
He thought they should get rid of the CIA.

1208
01:06:10,990 --> 01:06:12,730
He thought they should get
rid of the federal bank.

1209
01:06:12,731 --> 01:06:16,480
He was like proposing to
restructure everything and
they shot that dude right in

1210
01:06:16,481 --> 01:06:20,020
the fucking head. And if you don't think
that's what happened, you're crazy.

1211
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:24,250
Because Lyndon Johnson took over after
him and he's basically just a version of

1212
01:06:24,251 --> 01:06:27,010
George Bush.
Just play it by the book.

1213
01:06:27,011 --> 01:06:29,260
Good old boy version of George Bush.

1214
01:06:29,261 --> 01:06:31,480
And they went deep into
Vietnam right afterwards.

1215
01:06:31,481 --> 01:06:33,850
And they stay there for a while.
There was,

1216
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:38,350
there's no doubt in my mind that they
killed that guy who, I don't know.

1217
01:06:38,410 --> 01:06:42,850
I Dunno. I Dunno. But I have a feeling
he thought he was really president.

1218
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:45,030
Thank you know,
I think there's,

1219
01:06:45,110 --> 01:06:46,900
there's certain people that
get this idea in their head,

1220
01:06:46,901 --> 01:06:50,020
they're going to get in there and they're
just going to fucking change shit and

1221
01:06:50,021 --> 01:06:52,630
it's really gonna happen. And then
they get there and they'd go, whoa.

1222
01:06:52,631 --> 01:06:54,910
So this is how it works.
You know,

1223
01:06:55,030 --> 01:06:57,790
we were talking about Colin
Powell yesterday and I've
always thought that he was

1224
01:06:57,791 --> 01:07:01,870
one of those guys that like probably
could have been president, you know,

1225
01:07:01,871 --> 01:07:05,650
and when you're running for president,
I think they don't let you know. Shit,

1226
01:07:05,651 --> 01:07:07,660
I don't. I was like, you have
a clue as to how it works.

1227
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:12,250
And then finally one day you're,
you're actually an office and you realize,

1228
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:13,180
oh my God,

1229
01:07:13,181 --> 01:07:16,780
like they take you into the matrix room
where you watch all the fetuses that are

1230
01:07:16,781 --> 01:07:17,880
connected to these metals,

1231
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:22,420
suck fluid brains to feed this mothership.

1232
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:26,950
And you look at it and you go, oh my
God, this is the truth. This is reality.

1233
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:31,060
And then your hair starts going,
that's when your hair turns gray.

1234
01:07:31,410 --> 01:07:34,450
That's your hair starts calling Greg.
But what about, what about Powell though?

1235
01:07:34,451 --> 01:07:37,990
You feel like he felt like he was a,
another one of those guys. It's like,

1236
01:07:37,991 --> 01:07:42,780
he was like, you know, a real man of
character and a guy who you trust would,

1237
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:45,490
his word was then all of sudden he's
in the Bush administration. He's like,

1238
01:07:45,491 --> 01:07:46,930
Jesus Christ,

1239
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:50,080
just watching the whole thing go down
and eventually had to get out of there.

1240
01:07:50,290 --> 01:07:53,600
You know, it's like the, the whole
situation was crows. And then here,

1241
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:57,370
here's the guy was a genuine war hero
and is watching this chicken hawks,

1242
01:07:57,550 --> 01:07:57,791
you know,

1243
01:07:57,791 --> 01:08:01,300
forced us into these weird fucking wars
and he's creepy parts of the world and

1244
01:08:01,810 --> 01:08:05,680
coming up with these stupid fucking
reasons why we're supposed to be there and

1245
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:06,461
occupy la.

1246
01:08:06,461 --> 01:08:10,420
They had these pumpkin's in each pumpkin's
was carved with a different president

1247
01:08:10,421 --> 01:08:14,080
or person in office, you know, and
every time they made a bush wine,

1248
01:08:14,081 --> 01:08:18,190
it would get smashed like 30 minutes.
Like so every time they played,

1249
01:08:18,210 --> 01:08:21,110
the guy told me he would walk by they,
it was always smashed.

1250
01:08:21,111 --> 01:08:24,500
The Bush Bushman is always smashed.
He's a figurehead. That's funny.

1251
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:27,920
It's all he is, man. He's
just a figurehead. He's
just a dude who got a job.

1252
01:08:28,010 --> 01:08:31,400
You know, it's a not that much
different than me hosting fear factor.

1253
01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:34,010
See Obama is in Los Angeles.

1254
01:08:34,011 --> 01:08:36,380
He went to Roscoe's chicken
and waffles and there's photos.

1255
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:41,780
Unless that was an evil Twitter
prank. I am sorry if this,
if I, no, no, no, no, no.

1256
01:08:41,781 --> 01:08:45,950
He went, but he went, he went to Roscoe's
and it's hilarious. That places amazing.

1257
01:08:46,390 --> 01:08:49,130
Can't, I can't get into that
man. What? Chicken and waffles?

1258
01:08:49,670 --> 01:08:52,580
It's like fried chicken fried chicken.

1259
01:08:52,581 --> 01:08:56,390
It's not like they put syrup on the
chicken and stuff. I don't know.

1260
01:08:56,391 --> 01:08:58,130
You don't have to put Syrup on the chin.
My mind,

1261
01:08:58,190 --> 01:09:00,920
that's what it is and that's when I'm
like, fuck this. I'm not going dude.

1262
01:09:00,921 --> 01:09:02,900
It's all delicious.
[inaudible] crazy.

1263
01:09:02,901 --> 01:09:07,610
Listen chicken with a little bit of
syrup and some hot sauce. God Damn Son.

1264
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:08,360
I'll give it a shot.

1265
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:11,270
It's like instead of eating cornbread
with your fried chicken at 8:00 AM you

1266
01:09:11,271 --> 01:09:15,460
eating a waffle? The waffles you get
extra butter and extra syrup. All right.

1267
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:17,090
I just just go crazy with that bitch.

1268
01:09:17,091 --> 01:09:19,820
Just appreciate the fact that it's
going to be two days worth of calories.

1269
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:22,790
What you're supposed to eat in two days.
You're going to eat in one. Okay, I'll,

1270
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:25,610
I'll, I'll hold off until it
was all clear. My schedule.

1271
01:09:25,611 --> 01:09:28,640
You know what you gotta do?
Just do one day of heavy rock lifting.

1272
01:09:28,850 --> 01:09:29,780
You know what you'd do is just,

1273
01:09:29,781 --> 01:09:33,860
there's a lot of videos online of
guys who pick up these stone circles.

1274
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:36,350
You ever seen those guys
that come with atlas stones?

1275
01:09:36,590 --> 01:09:40,070
It's like a very particular type of
working out. They pick up these stones.

1276
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:43,430
They're like, it's like a giant
medicine ball. Me a stone.

1277
01:09:43,610 --> 01:09:45,860
And they carry these around.
They're very difficult to carry around.

1278
01:09:45,861 --> 01:09:49,250
They actually make special like wristbands
and shit so that they don't get the

1279
01:09:49,251 --> 01:09:51,350
skin of their forearms ripped apart.

1280
01:09:51,590 --> 01:09:55,490
They have these big long like padded
wristbands and he's fucking gods walk

1281
01:09:55,491 --> 01:09:59,480
around carrying these stones and this
thing's supposed to just like burn 800

1282
01:09:59,481 --> 01:10:03,350
calories full on caveman
shit. Uh, you know,

1283
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:06,530
that's like what charges up to
system to be the most strong suck.

1284
01:10:06,550 --> 01:10:09,350
Carrying something really
heavy and moving it somewhere.

1285
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:12,480
That's the hardest thing to do.
It requires the whole body to be strong.

1286
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:15,410
Every single aspect of the
body. Right? Very difficult.

1287
01:10:15,411 --> 01:10:18,530
So that's your move to do that and then
go Wah Roscoe's chicken and waffles.

1288
01:10:18,970 --> 01:10:21,650
He'll be so fucking
tired. He'd be like, man,

1289
01:10:21,651 --> 01:10:23,900
I don't give a fuck how
many calories are in that.

1290
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:27,590
I'm going to eat the shit out of that
stuff. I want to sit in the Obama booth.

1291
01:10:29,410 --> 01:10:30,890
There probably is one now.
Right.

1292
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:36,050
Do you think they have the keep it light
roped off with photos of him and then

1293
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:39,770
they said they weren't going
to do anything special for
the fact that he visited

1294
01:10:39,771 --> 01:10:43,060
the location because
apparently Reagan and uh,

1295
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:46,900
who's the other president who's
from California? Nixon. Yeah,

1296
01:10:47,130 --> 01:10:49,820
it came in Roscoe's all the time.
Really didn't,

1297
01:10:49,850 --> 01:10:51,890
they didn't change the menu or
do anything special for them.

1298
01:10:51,891 --> 01:10:53,220
They're not going to do that for Obama.
Yeah,

1299
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:57,710
but he's black and I know
that's what you're supposed
to say. US the rope it off.

1300
01:10:58,290 --> 01:10:59,390
Not only should they rope it off,

1301
01:10:59,391 --> 01:11:02,970
they should get Madame Trudeau's to
create a wax image of him sitting there.

1302
01:11:04,030 --> 01:11:04,863
Awesome.

1303
01:11:05,870 --> 01:11:09,680
And there'd be a photo there and you have
the whole thing in cased in glass and

1304
01:11:09,750 --> 01:11:14,130
kids will wipe their boogers on
it. They put quarters, they stick

1305
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:17,160
quarters in the last year trying to remove
one. And if you do, you get to keep it.

1306
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:20,490
One of those things.
It should be a big candle.

1307
01:11:20,491 --> 01:11:24,060
Light him from the top every day and see
the melt. While he's eating his waffles.

1308
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:27,780
A big candle. Yeah, like a big
candle statue where he is like,

1309
01:11:29,690 --> 01:11:32,820
oh yeah. If someone was wax,
statues are fucking incredible man.

1310
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:34,440
It's really amazing. Yeah. Some,

1311
01:11:34,530 --> 01:11:37,260
some of them I can't like they'll show
the celebrity standing next to it.

1312
01:11:37,261 --> 01:11:40,090
I can't tell who. Sometimes,
yeah, I'm doing rivers.

1313
01:11:40,670 --> 01:11:43,440
One of them looks weird and the other one
doesn't. But you still are like, well,

1314
01:11:43,441 --> 01:11:46,960
which one is it though? Yeah. You
know what I mean? And photos that,

1315
01:11:46,961 --> 01:11:49,290
just to show you how weird photos are,
you know,

1316
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:52,830
especially when the photos get photo
shopped and have you ever looked at

1317
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:56,610
someone's photos? Like you know like
especially like professional hot chicks,

1318
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,080
you know,
they'll have like a girl,

1319
01:11:58,081 --> 01:12:00,480
it's like a ring card girl or something
like that and there have her all touched

1320
01:12:00,481 --> 01:12:05,010
up or someone along those
lines. You barely can tell
what they really look like.

1321
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,740
Like you have to actually see them in
person to see what they're really looked

1322
01:12:07,741 --> 01:12:11,850
like. Because in this photo that's not
a real representative of who they are.

1323
01:12:11,851 --> 01:12:15,420
It's like it's weird paint thing.
It's like you painted,

1324
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:19,260
someone's painted over you. This is
not the real picture. This is your,

1325
01:12:19,310 --> 01:12:22,350
you're showing me a God damn cartoon. This
is like artwork. Well, I think three d,

1326
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:24,800
three d photos. I don't know if you've
seen like those new cell phones.

1327
01:12:24,820 --> 01:12:27,420
Cell phones. Yeah. I mean this
camera has a three d in it,

1328
01:12:27,421 --> 01:12:31,290
so you can take a panoramic views in
three d and then you hook up to your three

1329
01:12:31,291 --> 01:12:34,800
d TV and it's just like amazing
and real. Yeah, it's ridiculous.

1330
01:12:34,801 --> 01:12:36,650
You can like move your
head and look around. Wait,

1331
01:12:36,710 --> 01:12:39,130
show me a picture on the three d camera.
I've never seen that.

1332
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:43,350
You can't see it on this. Oh, you
got to put on a three D TV. Oh,

1333
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:47,340
that's a way to make money. Yeah. What
is it? Where's the the end of that?

1334
01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:51,270
This three d thing to me, I don't like
the movies where I have to wear glasses.

1335
01:12:51,271 --> 01:12:53,520
They have to figure out to
put something over the screen,

1336
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:57,270
but I'm thinking that this is
just a hiccup along the way.

1337
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:00,150
So get the Nintendo three Ds.
It's a little game.

1338
01:13:00,151 --> 01:13:04,890
Boy It's in three d without glasses now.
So it's just kind of show you five,

1339
01:13:04,891 --> 01:13:06,960
10 years. Yeah, it's going to be good.

1340
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:11,370
Those three d TVs where they have some
commercials or whatever playing in a bar

1341
01:13:11,371 --> 01:13:13,110
and it's, you know, it's kind of cool.

1342
01:13:13,111 --> 01:13:16,030
It's not as as good as it when you're
wearing the glasses and watching like

1343
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:19,110
avatar.
Avatar is like the only kind of movies.

1344
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:23,670
If it's like a big crazy action movie
like that, I'll wear this stupid glasses,

1345
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:27,370
those things. Or they're uncomfortable.
Then you used to wearing glasses? Yeah.

1346
01:13:27,850 --> 01:13:29,910
It's to you. It's in everybody.
Even even I don't like him.

1347
01:13:29,911 --> 01:13:33,030
I mean I have to take them off every once
in a while and just get my face arrest.

1348
01:13:33,031 --> 01:13:36,750
You never thought about getting an
operation? No, I can't do it, dude.

1349
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:41,970
Remember that movie fire in the sky back
in like the late eighties or early Ufo?

1350
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:45,280
You a phone guys.
Travis Walton,

1351
01:13:45,281 --> 01:13:48,810
I think the guy's name is very famous
Ufo case. And they showed, like,

1352
01:13:48,811 --> 01:13:50,940
I remember watching the trailer
when I was a kid and they were like,

1353
01:13:50,970 --> 01:13:55,530
the aliens were probing him in just the
needle was coming towards his eye and he

1354
01:13:55,531 --> 01:13:59,190
was freaking out and I just went,
I don't want anyone to ever touch my eye.

1355
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:03,330
And that stuck with me since I was a kid.
I was born, I had contacts for a while.

1356
01:14:03,331 --> 01:14:07,770
That took me a while to, to start
doing contacts. I, I hated it.

1357
01:14:07,890 --> 01:14:10,950
They scare the fuck out of you son Travis
Walton. You, yeah. That's the guy's,

1358
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:12,130
he's working as a logger

1359
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:16,300
in the woods in 1975. Yeah,
in Arizona, Flagstaff.

1360
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:18,670
And he was pulled out
into the fucking sky.

1361
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:22,220
I used to have that poster in my room.
Huge banner like would get like banners,

1362
01:14:22,510 --> 01:14:25,090
you know, you're doing poster
here, uh, for the movie theaters.

1363
01:14:25,150 --> 01:14:26,550
And they would throw them away,
but they would,

1364
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:28,810
you'd have to have them if you were,
you worked at the movie theater.

1365
01:14:28,811 --> 01:14:32,140
So I get all the cool ones and firing
the sky was like right on my wall right

1366
01:14:32,141 --> 01:14:35,560
when I walked in. Wow. That was a
dope fucking movie about abduction.

1367
01:14:35,561 --> 01:14:39,640
That was a fun movie, man.
Those, those alien movies
scare the shit out of me, man.

1368
01:14:39,710 --> 01:14:44,230
They still do. It's so easy
to say, AH, they're full of
shit. I don't believe them.

1369
01:14:44,231 --> 01:14:48,850
It's so easy to say that
because it doesn't happen
every day because it doesn't

1370
01:14:48,851 --> 01:14:52,910
happen every day. It's so easy to go.
Sad. It's fucking bullshit. Right?

1371
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:55,510
But could you imagine if it
actually was happening to you?

1372
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:59,920
How wonderful a fucking freak out
that would be. Like, Holy Shit.

1373
01:14:59,921 --> 01:15:02,350
They're real.
You're flying into the fucking sky,

1374
01:15:02,351 --> 01:15:04,340
into the space ship and they're
probing you and you're like,

1375
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:09,380
[inaudible] real and you're not gonna
be able to tell anybody about it.

1376
01:15:10,890 --> 01:15:14,140
Well, this was one of the best movies
at sort of representing that, that fire,

1377
01:15:14,150 --> 01:15:17,620
this guy moving, because it really
did represent that feeling of like,

1378
01:15:17,621 --> 01:15:20,830
you like you. Like that guy really
did seem like he was stuck. I mean,

1379
01:15:20,831 --> 01:15:22,960
it was a terrifying
whatever the fuck happened.

1380
01:15:23,470 --> 01:15:26,510
Whether or not they they're full of
shit or not. I don't know. I mean,

1381
01:15:26,590 --> 01:15:30,550
but the character in the movie, if that
was real, what a terrifying experience.

1382
01:15:30,551 --> 01:15:33,820
But that movie was like a recount
of that Guy Story and experience.

1383
01:15:33,820 --> 01:15:37,900
But even movies like he t ski, they
still, it still scares the shit out of me.

1384
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:39,640
I,

1385
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:43,480
there was like my parents' bedroom was
around the corner or are there a bathroom

1386
01:15:43,481 --> 01:15:45,880
was around the corner and their bedroom
and every once we had a big family,

1387
01:15:46,180 --> 01:15:48,550
so I'd have to use her bathroom every
once wants while I was scared to death,

1388
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:49,391
like as a little kid,

1389
01:15:49,391 --> 01:15:53,200
I thought fucking Iti would be sitting
on the toilet taking a shit or something.

1390
01:15:53,740 --> 01:15:54,573
I just,

1391
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:59,600
kids think weird things and even to
this day I'll go home and I just, Eh,

1392
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:02,320
I'm hesitant to even go in that bathroom.
I'm like,

1393
01:16:02,321 --> 01:16:03,760
I know eating is not going to be here,

1394
01:16:03,761 --> 01:16:06,680
but I still don't want to just walk
around the corner. What if it was white?

1395
01:16:07,050 --> 01:16:11,730
Do what if it was white t dragging
a leg? Like Zombie style. Wow.

1396
01:16:11,740 --> 01:16:15,970
He's made, eats he creepy. Did they should
make an Iti horror movie. Why he eats,

1397
01:16:15,971 --> 01:16:19,270
he's a lovable little character.
Was supposed to be. Yeah,

1398
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:22,450
that was a little grittier. And then
gives you saw the thing last night. Oh,

1399
01:16:22,451 --> 01:16:25,960
how was that thing? Prequel dude.
It's not getting good reviews,

1400
01:16:25,961 --> 01:16:29,890
but it's fucking good. I did want to
see it just because I love the thing.

1401
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:33,540
I don't know. I don't know what
rotten tomatoes gave it, but um,

1402
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:36,490
sometimes he can't trust
that stuff, man. I mean,

1403
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:39,590
I think trust in the car with some things,
but then there's other shit.

1404
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:45,020
33%, man. They say they're saying
it sucks. I don't get it. I mean,

1405
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:51,340
I was pretty sober actually. Sober. Yeah.
I had a glass of wine. That's it. Um,

1406
01:16:51,550 --> 01:16:54,040
but it was good, man. It's good. Look,

1407
01:16:54,041 --> 01:16:57,700
I'm a big fan of the John
Carpenter version of the
Kirk Douglas or Kurt Russell

1408
01:16:57,820 --> 01:17:02,080
version. Yeah. That's a good fucking
movie. That's fun. It's still holds up.

1409
01:17:02,081 --> 01:17:06,370
I watched that movie recently, like
a month or so ago. Still holds up.

1410
01:17:06,371 --> 01:17:10,160
That's solid. That's a solid
fucking movie. This movie was not

1411
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:15,020
quite as good as that. First of all
because, um, I don't, I didn't quite,

1412
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:19,850
the girl who was the lead is, she was
okay. She is her name. Good. I don't know.

1413
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:21,500
I don't know her name.
She's okay.

1414
01:17:21,530 --> 01:17:25,010
But I think she's wasn't Mary
Elizabeth Winstead. That's her name.

1415
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:30,210
So it wasn't a Kurt Russell. Kurt Russell
just brought so much to that park.

1416
01:17:30,211 --> 01:17:31,040
Her fucking Russell.

1417
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:36,040
Then that's Kurt Russell in his prime
dude with holding onto a fucking stick

1418
01:17:36,770 --> 01:17:41,600
grenades with a blow torches hand. Fucking
with all that, the ice in his face.

1419
01:17:41,601 --> 01:17:45,590
I'll pull this whole fucking place
and you're like, Whoa, that's intense.

1420
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:49,930
This district never hit that kind
of a, Oh my God, I'm about to die.

1421
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:53,490
It was like she's around
aliens and craziness and the,

1422
01:17:53,630 --> 01:17:58,070
but still somehow or another,
she's like Dwayne to composed for me.

1423
01:17:58,380 --> 01:18:02,780
You mean to me, I think everybody should
have been really freaking the fuck out.

1424
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:05,840
And I just, I, it just,
it didn't have that,

1425
01:18:05,860 --> 01:18:09,020
that's where the effects and
everything fucking insane.

1426
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:14,480
Fucking insane. Sex were amazing,
man. The effects were incredible.

1427
01:18:14,630 --> 01:18:18,460
Whether they can do now is, well,
first of all it's a prequel. So it's,

1428
01:18:18,470 --> 01:18:23,000
it's basically what happens and it takes
place in [inaudible] 82 so it's all

1429
01:18:23,001 --> 01:18:26,080
what happens right before the
Kurt Russell version of sure.

1430
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:29,030
So I dunno if they're going to Redo
that one. I hope they don't honestly.

1431
01:18:29,031 --> 01:18:32,570
Cause there's no need to just come
up with a new fucking idea. Please.

1432
01:18:32,690 --> 01:18:36,530
They probably will. The dude, everything's
getting remade though, if they redo it.

1433
01:18:36,531 --> 01:18:39,320
And so it's really,
it's really a shit trick because yeah,

1434
01:18:39,321 --> 01:18:42,380
you'll go back to see ky Kang,
the fourth remake of King Kong,

1435
01:18:42,470 --> 01:18:45,320
but you know he's going to fucking die
at the end. It's still the same story.

1436
01:18:45,490 --> 01:18:49,040
So you're just going to trick me with
a bunch of new shit in the middle that

1437
01:18:49,041 --> 01:18:50,180
wasn't in the original one.

1438
01:18:50,180 --> 01:18:53,060
So you're basically making your own
movie for the middle. You have a very,

1439
01:18:53,090 --> 01:18:56,920
very flimsy guidelines. Got To
pick up King Kong, grab bag,

1440
01:18:56,980 --> 01:18:59,060
bring them back to America.
You figure it out.

1441
01:18:59,270 --> 01:19:02,240
Then she's supposed to be there and
sacrifice. She's gotta be blonde.

1442
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:06,490
You got to have a lot of
naked black checks and nobody
cares about con grabs and

1443
01:19:06,491 --> 01:19:08,600
then you get them and everything
else you can make up on your own.

1444
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:11,750
So every version is, that's what
we're, we're, we're tuning in for,

1445
01:19:11,751 --> 01:19:14,510
we're tuning in for the shit that
they made up. It's like, yeah,

1446
01:19:14,511 --> 01:19:15,590
we know what's going to happen.

1447
01:19:15,591 --> 01:19:17,630
He's going to climb the empire state
building is going to get shot down.

1448
01:19:17,631 --> 01:19:20,750
He's going to die. That's the end. What do
you, what are you creating in there? Oh,

1449
01:19:20,751 --> 01:19:23,330
well we've got is this and
now he's going to battle with,

1450
01:19:23,331 --> 01:19:24,650
he's fucking kick his black.

1451
01:19:27,890 --> 01:19:30,740
I want to see super racist movie.
King Kong is,

1452
01:19:30,950 --> 01:19:35,360
I want to see Johnny English reborn
Johnny English. We see it. Mr. Bean.

1453
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:41,390
No,
I was never big into Mr. I wasn't either,

1454
01:19:41,391 --> 01:19:45,380
but my little brother loved that and
so if I want her to hang out with him,

1455
01:19:45,381 --> 01:19:48,500
we'd watch mister. He loved all
that British shit and so we'd,

1456
01:19:48,501 --> 01:19:51,500
I'd watch Mr. Bean and after it was
hard growing on me, man. I'm like,

1457
01:19:51,530 --> 01:19:54,500
it's so stupid.
It's funny.

1458
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:58,700
It's so stupid that it finally
becomes funny. And then I was,

1459
01:19:58,790 --> 01:20:00,020
I don't remember what
movie I was watching,

1460
01:20:00,021 --> 01:20:03,650
but the trailer for Johnny English came
out and I was laughing throughout the

1461
01:20:03,651 --> 01:20:07,500
whole fucking thing. Man. It's so
funny. I can't wait to see it dude.

1462
01:20:07,501 --> 01:20:08,010
We're going to have

1463
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:10,740
Shane Smith from vice TV.
Come on.

1464
01:20:10,741 --> 01:20:14,690
The guy who goes to the lady boys
and the guy went to Liberia. Oh cool.

1465
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:18,690
I tweeted him today and he tweeted, he's
going to, he's going to do the podcast.

1466
01:20:18,691 --> 01:20:22,950
He's in Beirut right now filming. Who
knows what kind of fuck with the lady boy.

1467
01:20:22,951 --> 01:20:25,770
Like he goes to Thailand and gets a
lady boy ever heard of the vice guide to

1468
01:20:25,771 --> 01:20:30,360
travel? No Fun at the best
one. It's on MTV now. Ryan is,

1469
01:20:30,361 --> 01:20:32,230
I would have told him, you
know, I only watch on Netflix,

1470
01:20:32,231 --> 01:20:37,110
so it's one of the best fucking exposé.
What's the best way to describe it?

1471
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:38,640
New shows.

1472
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:43,500
It's like a documentary online sort of a
show where they do a bunch of different

1473
01:20:43,501 --> 01:20:47,550
things. Like one of the guys is whenever
they have some sort of a drug situation,

1474
01:20:47,551 --> 01:20:51,240
they have one guy who's like
a serious fucking cycad.

1475
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:56,040
He's like massively into psychedelics
and he's like super, super,

1476
01:20:56,041 --> 01:20:56,800
like uh,

1477
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:01,770
educated about them and he sits down
with Sasha soul gin and they go over the

1478
01:21:01,950 --> 01:21:06,950
various thousands of different known
psychedelic compounds and human use and

1479
01:21:07,550 --> 01:21:08,990
it's just incredible shit.

1480
01:21:08,991 --> 01:21:13,380
He went to the jungle and did Iowasca
with the natives and I mean they have

1481
01:21:13,381 --> 01:21:14,101
incredible shows.

1482
01:21:14,101 --> 01:21:17,460
They went to Liberia and literally they're
in a whorehouse in Liberia where it

1483
01:21:17,461 --> 01:21:20,910
was like a dollar or it might've been
less than a dollar to have sex with

1484
01:21:20,911 --> 01:21:24,420
somebody. Yeah, it's increased. I mean in
these guys go there, they go everywhere.

1485
01:21:24,421 --> 01:21:28,650
They go to the Congo, they go everywhere,
it's nuts. And he went to North Korea.

1486
01:21:28,651 --> 01:21:32,670
This Guy Shane Smith went to North Korea.
They went to the Thailand one.

1487
01:21:32,671 --> 01:21:34,320
He's hanging out with lady boys.

1488
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:38,010
Like they picked up some lady boys and
brought them back and we're sitting in

1489
01:21:38,011 --> 01:21:42,000
the tub with them, hang out with them,
I think. I think I saw that. Was that,

1490
01:21:42,001 --> 01:21:45,090
was that it also a documentary or is this
just on his show? It's just the show.

1491
01:21:45,091 --> 01:21:48,840
It's just, I don't know. I don't know
the history of it and that's what a,

1492
01:21:48,841 --> 01:21:52,710
why it'd be great to have him on
because I don't know how it got founded,

1493
01:21:52,711 --> 01:21:55,290
but these guys have fucking balls,
man.

1494
01:21:55,291 --> 01:21:58,410
They're savages and I've been a big
fan of their work for a long time.

1495
01:21:58,680 --> 01:21:59,400
And one of them,

1496
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:03,600
my favorite one is the one where they go
up to visit that guy that lives a deep,

1497
01:22:03,601 --> 01:22:07,350
deep, deep in Alaska. That guy
that lives a member, um, he,

1498
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:12,560
he lives alone with his wife and they
have like this little log cabin in the

1499
01:22:13,591 --> 01:22:18,570
middle of nowhere and like North
East Alaska, North East Alaska,

1500
01:22:18,571 --> 01:22:20,350
like way the fuck up there,
you know,

1501
01:22:20,430 --> 01:22:24,120
where there's nobody man and this
guy and they'd go hang out with him.

1502
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:28,230
And he's just every day hunting
caribou fishing for fish.

1503
01:22:28,350 --> 01:22:32,400
Just every day is just foraging food and
these are bright guy and he's been up

1504
01:22:32,401 --> 01:22:36,090
there for like 30 years and he believes
that's like the only way people are

1505
01:22:36,091 --> 01:22:38,220
supposed to live.
And that's the best way to be happy.

1506
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:42,060
Like he's super content up
there. He's like, you know,
I don't have any depression.

1507
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:44,970
I don't have any problems. You know, I
just, I, I, this is what I like to do.

1508
01:22:44,971 --> 01:22:48,420
I like to hunt and gather and he's
that and he's not a dummy man.

1509
01:22:48,570 --> 01:22:51,420
It's a really fascinating fucking show.

1510
01:22:51,690 --> 01:22:55,440
And in the middle of the show they have
to kill a bear because the bear, uh, was,

1511
01:22:55,441 --> 01:22:57,600
uh, getting out his food,
you know, cause he's,

1512
01:22:57,660 --> 01:23:00,100
he shoots Caribou and then he
has to hang the Caribou. Right.

1513
01:23:00,101 --> 01:23:01,620
And sometimes they have a problem.

1514
01:23:01,621 --> 01:23:05,380
You're hanging in his fucking care about
and bear [inaudible] brown and when

1515
01:23:05,381 --> 01:23:08,020
they come around you have to kill him.
Yeah. So in the middle of the night,

1516
01:23:08,021 --> 01:23:12,710
they're chasing him with
cameras. Waste, fucking shooting.
It's bare. It's wild dog.

1517
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:16,330
Cause they're in the middle of nowhere.
I mean someone has to come by and drop

1518
01:23:16,390 --> 01:23:18,950
[inaudible] goods for
them out of a parachute.

1519
01:23:18,951 --> 01:23:22,580
That's the only way that he's getting
a gooey Hannah. Yeah. Fuck. Well,

1520
01:23:22,581 --> 01:23:24,310
if he's been there for 30 years,
maybe you should.

1521
01:23:25,010 --> 01:23:29,120
Maybe he left like in the 80s where it was
like, oh look, set tapes suck. You know,

1522
01:23:29,121 --> 01:23:32,250
fucking Atari. 2,600 this is
lane. I gotta get Outta here.

1523
01:23:32,251 --> 01:23:35,240
You know how to be happy. Yeah,
I'll go out in the middle of Alaska.

1524
01:23:35,241 --> 01:23:39,890
I wonder if he's travels to like at
main city or peaches in a long time.

1525
01:23:40,060 --> 01:23:43,510
It has been. But as of the show,
as of the vice guide to travel,

1526
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:47,280
I don't think he had ever
even seen nine 11 yeah,

1527
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:48,790
I don't think he'd ever
seen the towers fall

1528
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:50,580
check checkout TVs now.
You know,

1529
01:23:50,581 --> 01:23:53,090
like maybe he's just had
no idea how awesome it is.

1530
01:23:53,390 --> 01:23:57,560
Maybe. Maybe, but maybe he's
right. Maybe like, you know, we,

1531
01:23:57,561 --> 01:23:59,960
our bodies are still the same bodies.
I mean,

1532
01:23:59,980 --> 01:24:03,410
you've got to think that there's a
bunch of like reward systems that are in

1533
01:24:03,411 --> 01:24:07,730
place to ensure that people stay alive.
And for the longest time,

1534
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,570
for a period of thousands and
thousands and thousands of years,

1535
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:13,970
the way we stayed alive
was hunting and gathering.

1536
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,770
That's the way we stayed alive.
We went out and we,

1537
01:24:15,820 --> 01:24:19,670
we killed our own food and we caught her
own fish and we grew our own fruit and

1538
01:24:19,671 --> 01:24:20,504
vegetables.

1539
01:24:20,510 --> 01:24:25,510
And I think to this day we're probably
wired with a reward system that enforces

1540
01:24:26,031 --> 01:24:27,590
that. Like when you, when you do that,

1541
01:24:27,591 --> 01:24:29,510
it probably feels really
good because I know a lot of,

1542
01:24:29,511 --> 01:24:32,150
I used to be hooked on fishing.
I used to love fishing,

1543
01:24:32,151 --> 01:24:35,710
I used to fish all the time. It's a
very primal thing. Like the, the, the,

1544
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:38,210
the excitement of catching a fish.
It's very,

1545
01:24:38,211 --> 01:24:42,890
it's very much wired system
as his hunting, supposedly,
I haven't been hunting,

1546
01:24:42,891 --> 01:24:46,280
but they all say that people can't, you
know, they all say that it's, it's, it's,

1547
01:24:46,281 --> 01:24:48,890
it's wired into man.
And that's why people to this day,

1548
01:24:48,891 --> 01:24:53,120
even though it's easy to get food, still
go hunting, not even just for, you know,

1549
01:24:53,121 --> 01:24:55,730
for the meat and the, for the fact
that they need to meet to stay alive.

1550
01:24:55,731 --> 01:25:00,140
But just for, for the actual excitement of
it because it's, you know, it's, it's, uh,

1551
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:03,950
there's an exciting thing
about procuring your own food,

1552
01:25:03,951 --> 01:25:05,690
going out and getting your own food and,

1553
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:10,130
and sustaining yourself through your
own work instead of sustaining yourself

1554
01:25:10,131 --> 01:25:12,200
through a supermarket where
he just kind of empty.

1555
01:25:12,201 --> 01:25:14,930
We pay for things and just consume them.
You know?

1556
01:25:14,931 --> 01:25:18,860
And some people really believe that the,
the real true way to be happy is to,

1557
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:19,341
I mean,

1558
01:25:19,341 --> 01:25:22,730
it's not very progressive
because eventually we have
to evolve past the state,

1559
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:23,890
but some people think they're,

1560
01:25:23,900 --> 01:25:28,340
the true way to be happy is to live
as if people were living, you know,

1561
01:25:28,370 --> 01:25:30,320
thousands of years ago when
there was no electricity.

1562
01:25:30,530 --> 01:25:33,200
And then all this technology,
even though we are enjoying in it,

1563
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:37,700
it's enhancing our life. We're not
really wired to, to use this stuff.

1564
01:25:37,750 --> 01:25:41,480
We're not wired to be influenced
by it. You know, like televisions,

1565
01:25:41,481 --> 01:25:43,100
we were talking about TVs and movies.

1566
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:46,520
You think about the
influence that a film has.

1567
01:25:46,700 --> 01:25:49,820
Think about the influence that that has
compared to any influence that you would

1568
01:25:49,821 --> 01:25:51,230
actually see in the natural world.

1569
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:55,940
And compared to what you're supposed
to be receiving the the human brain,

1570
01:25:55,941 --> 01:25:58,460
like as you're developing and
learning and going through life,

1571
01:25:58,461 --> 01:26:01,970
you're supposed to be impressed by
certain things. Acts of bravery.

1572
01:26:02,150 --> 01:26:02,990
He's supposed to be impressed.

1573
01:26:03,110 --> 01:26:07,130
Character and press by leadership and
all these things are supposed to impress

1574
01:26:07,131 --> 01:26:11,690
you because you should eventually take
on that role yourself. If you're a man,

1575
01:26:11,691 --> 01:26:15,020
you should actually develop to a person
of character and respect and leadership.

1576
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:17,810
Hopefully if you ever will
want to become the leader.

1577
01:26:17,930 --> 01:26:19,460
But until then you follow the leader,

1578
01:26:19,461 --> 01:26:21,950
you follow the Alpha cause that's
the one that has all the information.

1579
01:26:21,951 --> 01:26:23,570
They've already lived a long life.

1580
01:26:23,571 --> 01:26:26,660
They've learned some things and if you
want to stay alive, you follow him.

1581
01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:30,410
Now this is what's programmed in our head,
but instead of that,

1582
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:34,100
what we're getting in,
this is fucking a hundred foot screen.

1583
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:38,450
We were wearing glasses
that make everything three
d and this paralyzed dude's

1584
01:26:38,451 --> 01:26:40,460
gonna fuck this blue chick.
You know,

1585
01:26:40,461 --> 01:26:44,580
and it's like our bodies and our
brains almost can't process that,

1586
01:26:44,581 --> 01:26:49,250
that much bullshit. It's like, even
though we know it's just a movie,

1587
01:26:49,670 --> 01:26:54,500
there's certain parts of our subconscious
or even our consciousness that I think

1588
01:26:54,501 --> 01:26:59,501
are programmed to expect movie
like results from real life.

1589
01:27:00,050 --> 01:27:01,850
And when you don't have
anything like that,

1590
01:27:01,910 --> 01:27:04,130
when you realize that the
reality of it is, well no,

1591
01:27:04,131 --> 01:27:08,390
I'm just some weird person who gets an
a metal fucking box and it's on rubber

1592
01:27:08,391 --> 01:27:12,140
wheels and I ride over this hard surface
to this same spot where I sit in a

1593
01:27:12,141 --> 01:27:15,640
cubicle every fucking day
and repeat over and over.

1594
01:27:15,660 --> 01:27:18,740
There's no Sandra Bullock movie for
me, man. There's no, there's no,

1595
01:27:18,770 --> 01:27:22,040
there's no beautiful ending. Like
what the fuck, man, this is reality.

1596
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:26,480
But we're so programmed by this idea of,
of,

1597
01:27:26,540 --> 01:27:31,370
of happy endings and this idea of easy
to follow storylines where it all works

1598
01:27:31,371 --> 01:27:35,770
out in the end that I,
you know, and it's, it's,

1599
01:27:35,771 --> 01:27:38,040
it's a, it's a trip. It's a trip to,

1600
01:27:38,090 --> 01:27:42,170
to wonder whether or not we have created
something in our mass media and our

1601
01:27:42,171 --> 01:27:42,431
media,

1602
01:27:42,431 --> 01:27:46,610
in our television or movies we have
created something that influences us far

1603
01:27:46,611 --> 01:27:50,390
beyond what we can control.
And almost like that's how it's,

1604
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:53,890
it's difficult for people to truly
understand people anymore. It's so,

1605
01:27:53,891 --> 01:27:56,360
I'm just like,
people aren't even influencing people.

1606
01:27:56,361 --> 01:27:58,430
People's creations are influencing people.

1607
01:27:58,580 --> 01:28:02,220
Artificial bullshit is influencing
people, you know? And the,

1608
01:28:02,250 --> 01:28:07,010
the actual what you know who the
human is below all of it. It's very,

1609
01:28:07,011 --> 01:28:11,880
very difficult to distinguish for a
lot of people. Wrap your head. I had

1610
01:28:11,890 --> 01:28:15,960
about that bitch. So I'm
reading the biography of Steve
Jobs, I think I mentioned,

1611
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:17,030
but they're talking,

1612
01:28:17,030 --> 01:28:20,130
they're the one cool thing that they
kind of hinted at was the future.

1613
01:28:20,131 --> 01:28:24,990
How Steve Jobs thought that
he had mapped out the next TV.

1614
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:27,240
He broke the,
the idea for the next TV.

1615
01:28:27,540 --> 01:28:30,780
And so there's like these rumors now that
apple might start making their own TV

1616
01:28:30,781 --> 01:28:32,930
sets. Like, you know,
like, well tell you what,

1617
01:28:32,940 --> 01:28:37,840
that Apple TV program is fucking great
man. I love it. Oh, the apple TV.

1618
01:28:37,970 --> 01:28:42,250
The actual box. It's a little
tiny ass box man. Yeah, I got it.

1619
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:46,410
And so I was thinking with the,
with how good Siri is, what,

1620
01:28:46,411 --> 01:28:50,940
what could imagine being able to tell
your TV like a find me family guy Thursday

1621
01:28:50,970 --> 01:28:51,803
record,

1622
01:28:51,930 --> 01:28:56,760
turn the channel Hbo Record that you know
and how it's probably going to mix in

1623
01:28:56,761 --> 01:29:00,990
with the Siri into the TV.
Can you, wouldn't that be
awesome to be able to just,

1624
01:29:01,020 --> 01:29:02,070
yeah,
that's inevitable

1625
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:04,260
I think. Why isn't it like
that? Like if you use connects,

1626
01:29:04,261 --> 01:29:06,210
obviously moving that
direction like we're going to,

1627
01:29:06,211 --> 01:29:08,210
we're going to get that
real quick, right? Oh.

1628
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:11,410
Have you ever seen Bill Gates' house?
Have you ever seen no, there's,

1629
01:29:11,430 --> 01:29:12,270
there's a bunch of videos.

1630
01:29:12,271 --> 01:29:14,640
There was actually a thread about it
on my message board a few weeks ago.

1631
01:29:14,641 --> 01:29:18,810
I think I'm amazing house and you
wear a pin when you entered the room.

1632
01:29:19,110 --> 01:29:20,400
When you get into his house,

1633
01:29:20,401 --> 01:29:25,170
you put a pin on and this
pin has a microchip in it
and every room it recognizes

1634
01:29:25,171 --> 01:29:27,300
you. It knows that you're the
one who entered into the room.

1635
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:30,990
So it changes the movies or a track
changes, right? The images on the wall,

1636
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:33,090
it changes the atmosphere,
the temperature.

1637
01:29:33,170 --> 01:29:35,730
What's funny is that, so that, that,

1638
01:29:35,740 --> 01:29:38,630
that's so funny how that's
old technology already.

1639
01:29:38,660 --> 01:29:40,670
Cause even with connect with x box,

1640
01:29:40,671 --> 01:29:42,650
you have it in your house
and you walk in the room,

1641
01:29:42,651 --> 01:29:45,800
it detects your face and in
logs you win and connect.

1642
01:29:45,980 --> 01:29:48,380
Does it start playing music
and change the light? No,

1643
01:29:48,381 --> 01:29:52,130
but it logs you in and then like you
can have like your like Netflix and he'd

1644
01:29:52,131 --> 01:29:54,440
sit there with your hand and you string
through the movies with your hand.

1645
01:29:54,441 --> 01:29:59,110
Kind of like you can go through
Netflix with your hand. Yeah.

1646
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,640
Yeah. Crazy. Imagine now
lazy people, even more lazy.

1647
01:30:06,650 --> 01:30:09,800
It's not incredible though.
I mean that is a big jump.

1648
01:30:10,210 --> 01:30:10,781
Big Jump.

1649
01:30:10,781 --> 01:30:13,780
The ability that we have right now to
sit in front of the TV and swipe things

1650
01:30:13,781 --> 01:30:15,040
with your hand in space.

1651
01:30:15,350 --> 01:30:18,350
Now imagine not having, didn't move
your hand now just being like theory,

1652
01:30:18,351 --> 01:30:21,770
find me this.
Maybe you do this kit.

1653
01:30:21,860 --> 01:30:23,720
I was just getting used
to the retinal scan.

1654
01:30:24,060 --> 01:30:26,480
Like that blows my mind that
you could put your eye up.

1655
01:30:26,750 --> 01:30:30,470
I mean when have you used that
on a laptop? I've never used it.

1656
01:30:30,471 --> 01:30:33,860
I just see it in movies. I'm like,
what the fuck is that? I love real.

1657
01:30:33,861 --> 01:30:34,620
They have it for life

1658
01:30:34,620 --> 01:30:38,610
tops now. They have fingerprint
ones and they have retina scan ones.

1659
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:41,730
Wait, they have retina scan
one. I've only seen a finger.

1660
01:30:41,731 --> 01:30:45,300
When do it like to log in or I'm
just security. I know they do it for,

1661
01:30:45,860 --> 01:30:49,610
they have my gym 24 hour fitness I,
that's how I sign it.

1662
01:30:50,630 --> 01:30:53,280
Yeah, that's some of the, we don't
work out in the same gym, but yeah,

1663
01:30:54,050 --> 01:30:57,650
I never see you there. I know I'm 24
hour fitness. Which one did you go to?

1664
01:30:58,370 --> 01:31:00,890
Santa Monica.
Yeah.

1665
01:31:01,590 --> 01:31:06,190
I can't find this. I might've made that
up. How to buy retina biometrics. Camera?

1666
01:31:06,191 --> 01:31:09,160
No, they have them. I don't know
if they have it on laptops yet.

1667
01:31:09,820 --> 01:31:12,850
It wouldn't surprise me if there's like
a thing you plug into the back of your

1668
01:31:12,851 --> 01:31:15,070
computer sits on top.
You'd do like a retinal scan.

1669
01:31:15,071 --> 01:31:17,890
Then it brings up your
profile or something,

1670
01:31:18,340 --> 01:31:21,190
but then you know people would worry.
What if somebody cut your eyeballs out?

1671
01:31:21,430 --> 01:31:25,630
That's what I'm always at like with a
pencil, like you jam a pencil in there,

1672
01:31:25,631 --> 01:31:30,250
pop that sucker out and then you get in
behind the security wall that you're,

1673
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:32,710
you shouldn't be,
but you got the eyeball and then uh,

1674
01:31:32,711 --> 01:31:36,800
you strapped the nukes to yourself
and pull the pin and yeah, that's it.

1675
01:31:37,300 --> 01:31:38,470
Getting kind of jealous.
My uh,

1676
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:41,650
girlfriend's brother's building a computer
right now and he just bought his new

1677
01:31:41,651 --> 01:31:44,860
case on this case.
It looks like alien ware

1678
01:31:47,230 --> 01:31:48,490
Jealous Cause you're, you're, no,

1679
01:31:48,491 --> 01:31:52,300
because I missed those days buying like
you sit there and find the coolest case.

1680
01:31:52,301 --> 01:31:56,920
He Pan and you find which motherboard
that you've done before. Yeah.

1681
01:31:56,921 --> 01:31:59,980
Just pretend he's doing it
now. Yeah, I just missing

1682
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:03,470
it. Yeah. It's kind of funny. I forget
that I get, and then there's like a,

1683
01:32:03,471 --> 01:32:07,530
that new game that just came out to a
battlefield three and there was showing

1684
01:32:07,540 --> 01:32:11,200
how bad acid looks and how I'm
thinking, man, I wish, I wish,

1685
01:32:11,230 --> 01:32:15,310
I almost want to build like some stupid
gaming computer so you don't get as much

1686
01:32:15,311 --> 01:32:19,690
free time as it is. I know I need
to clone people. No you don't.

1687
01:32:19,770 --> 01:32:23,470
You just enjoy less things.
But I'm with you on the computers.

1688
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:27,910
I used to love the satisfaction of
putting together a computer, you know,

1689
01:32:27,911 --> 01:32:32,560
punching him, putting the
mush, the motherboard,
punching in the ram, you know,

1690
01:32:32,590 --> 01:32:36,520
setting everything up. And then the moment
it turns on you boot up windows like,

1691
01:32:36,521 --> 01:32:41,110
yes, what the fuck do I don't Miss Jumper
setting. So Jumpers, settings in the ass,

1692
01:32:41,111 --> 01:32:42,020
if they still have jumpers,

1693
01:32:42,021 --> 01:32:46,780
settings have tweezers and used to have
to like move these little things like

1694
01:32:46,781 --> 01:32:49,480
what the fuck were those things?
But how about that shit?

1695
01:32:49,481 --> 01:32:52,810
And then it was like primes where your
graphics card would interfere with your

1696
01:32:52,811 --> 01:32:54,790
sound card.
Like what was that called?

1697
01:32:54,791 --> 01:32:58,030
Like in that box bios you had
to change frequencies and shit.

1698
01:32:58,120 --> 01:33:01,020
Oh that was so knowing that shit you,

1699
01:33:01,030 --> 01:33:04,110
but I think you learn how
much does this one work?

1700
01:33:04,220 --> 01:33:08,560
My appreciate Max so much. I love the
fact that I don't have to do anything.

1701
01:33:08,561 --> 01:33:08,771
You know,

1702
01:33:08,771 --> 01:33:12,970
you could say that it's a computer for
people weren't power users or whatever

1703
01:33:12,971 --> 01:33:15,880
you want to say.
Let the fact that I don't have to do shit.

1704
01:33:15,940 --> 01:33:18,480
It knows what you're wanting to do.
It's like, Oh, do you want to do that?

1705
01:33:18,481 --> 01:33:21,160
I'll just do it for you.
Yeah, it's like that.

1706
01:33:21,430 --> 01:33:24,670
I Dunno if it's like a
sketch or something. It was
just like move. I got it.

1707
01:33:25,060 --> 01:33:29,230
You know? And I don't have to go into
the registry and tweak the settings.

1708
01:33:29,230 --> 01:33:31,750
Like what the fuck are you
talking about man? I'm like,

1709
01:33:31,751 --> 01:33:35,660
what am I even doing in there? I don't
know what to talk about this. This.

1710
01:33:36,110 --> 01:33:37,120
I've talked about it before.

1711
01:33:37,270 --> 01:33:40,590
This is the best coconut water I've ever
had in my life. Yeah. I tell everybody,

1712
01:33:40,690 --> 01:33:42,930
everybody says coconut water
tastes like Shit. Yeah.

1713
01:33:42,931 --> 01:33:47,010
And I never understood why they said
that until I tried other stuff and I,

1714
01:33:47,060 --> 01:33:50,650
these people are not paying me a dime.
This is all just honesty.

1715
01:33:50,890 --> 01:33:55,000
I think they have a great proxy to o
is the Shit. And I asked him, I said,

1716
01:33:55,001 --> 01:33:58,690
why is your coconut water so much better?
Cause it's really delicious. I go,

1717
01:33:58,691 --> 01:34:00,560
do you add sugar? And they go, no, no, no.

1718
01:34:00,610 --> 01:34:04,270
What we do is we get our coconuts
from a single plantation in Thailand,

1719
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:05,920
they own the plantation.

1720
01:34:06,070 --> 01:34:10,260
And so this plantation in
Thailand is the apparently date.

1721
01:34:10,270 --> 01:34:14,700
The Thais have the sweetest coconuts,
real delicious coconut taste,

1722
01:34:14,710 --> 01:34:17,950
and very sweet. And that's
the key. So that's, this is,

1723
01:34:17,980 --> 01:34:21,460
I don't know what other companies
get their shit from Thailand too,

1724
01:34:21,461 --> 01:34:24,310
but you'd get it from them because
that's where c two o gets it there.

1725
01:34:24,330 --> 01:34:27,430
They're fucking, let's talk about coconut
water. And they're like, oh, I love it.

1726
01:34:27,431 --> 01:34:28,770
So I went to whole foods and,

1727
01:34:28,830 --> 01:34:32,740
and I bought three different kinds because
I figured I wouldn't like one of them

1728
01:34:32,741 --> 01:34:36,820
or whatever, just to try them out. I hated
all three of them. Yeah. This is amazing.

1729
01:34:36,821 --> 01:34:40,750
It's amazing when people, people think
I'm exaggerating and like I said,

1730
01:34:40,810 --> 01:34:43,330
no one's giving me a fucking dime.
I swear to God.

1731
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:46,480
There's definitely bad coconut water
that other kind of you had a couple of

1732
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:51,310
weeks ago. I did not even want to finish.
And that's, yeah, this is delicious.

1733
01:34:51,311 --> 01:34:55,030
This stuff is fucking, it's, and it's
so good for you, man. It's really good.

1734
01:34:55,031 --> 01:34:58,160
Like for when you're working out,
like it's a good like

1735
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:02,240
natural isotonic beverage, whatever the
fuck isotonic means, whatever it is,

1736
01:35:02,241 --> 01:35:03,000
it's good.

1737
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,010
Joe, do you know if it's
okay, you have a Vitamix?

1738
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:09,340
Is it okay to mix like vitamins into
your drinks to like crush them into the

1739
01:35:09,341 --> 01:35:12,300
drinks with? Is that something that be
okay? Well, I guess you could do that,

1740
01:35:12,301 --> 01:35:15,710
but why would you do that when you can
just take them? Yeah. I don't know.

1741
01:35:16,150 --> 01:35:18,990
But what do you, uh, what are
you eating with vitamins? No,

1742
01:35:18,991 --> 01:35:22,180
I mean like I do like a bunch of, like
one of those packs of vitamins every day.

1743
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:24,200
I've been throwing it into the,

1744
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:27,020
he could do that. Sure. You
could do that, but you know,

1745
01:35:27,021 --> 01:35:29,880
you got to wonder how much of it is
going to get stuck to the walls. Right.

1746
01:35:29,910 --> 01:35:33,860
How much of it is actually in your,
you know, right. Yeah. I don't know.

1747
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:36,500
You know what kind of,
what kind of vitamins you're taking

1748
01:35:37,090 --> 01:35:39,160
fish oil? Uh, it,

1749
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:43,180
it's just one of those packs you buy
where it has a big pack of different kinds

1750
01:35:43,181 --> 01:35:47,640
and you take like a plastic baggies?
No, it's uh, from Costco. Yeah.

1751
01:35:48,460 --> 01:35:50,560
Do you notice any difference
when you take vitamins? Yeah,

1752
01:35:50,561 --> 01:35:54,700
my ps really yellow and the smells
bad. Smells bad. It smells like pee,

1753
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:57,270
like hardcore p more waters.

1754
01:35:57,720 --> 01:36:00,910
A study recently the, I mean there's
always studies one way or another,

1755
01:36:00,911 --> 01:36:04,080
but this study recently had
said something about, uh,

1756
01:36:04,450 --> 01:36:08,950
there were doubting the efficacy of a
large doses of vitamins and they were

1757
01:36:08,951 --> 01:36:11,170
saying that may even be
harmful for some people.

1758
01:36:11,470 --> 01:36:13,280
It's really interesting because I,

1759
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:18,070
I always wonder how the fuck do you
judge that? How do you figure that out?

1760
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:21,150
Well, it's probably like
anything, if you overdo like a B,

1761
01:36:21,151 --> 01:36:23,910
12 or a c or something like that,
it's probably not good for you.

1762
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:28,440
How much of it is placebo then?
You know, like with vitamins? Yeah.

1763
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:31,890
It's like how much is, is this
vitamin C actually helping me? Well,

1764
01:36:31,891 --> 01:36:35,520
it's also like w how much do you need
as opposed to how much other people

1765
01:36:37,470 --> 01:36:40,080
though. It's not like it's
crazy, you know it's not,

1766
01:36:40,410 --> 01:36:44,520
I think it's just basic stuff to
you like fish away. I'll d whatever,

1767
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:48,510
fish oil and d. Well you know
you don't eat and healthy either.

1768
01:36:48,630 --> 01:36:52,980
So for you and pretty healthy how to be
the problem is I only eat once a day.

1769
01:36:53,070 --> 01:36:55,500
Why do you do that? Well, like
today, you know, I wake up,

1770
01:36:55,501 --> 01:37:00,210
I get some coffee I can't eat before I
have my coffee. You know, coffee? Yeah.

1771
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:03,810
It doesn't work. Like I can't eat unless
you get an upset stomach sort of thing.

1772
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:06,930
I just zero hunger like it's,
it sounds gross.

1773
01:37:06,931 --> 01:37:08,790
Like I would probably
get sick if I try to eat.

1774
01:37:08,791 --> 01:37:12,720
If I have my coffee for some ranchers
then and then I usually do something like

1775
01:37:12,721 --> 01:37:16,150
this. Like I'm doing this podcast right
now. I probably will get home put, put,

1776
01:37:16,170 --> 01:37:16,861
do the podcasts,

1777
01:37:16,861 --> 01:37:19,410
put it up online and then probably eat
around seven or eight o'clock at night.

1778
01:37:19,710 --> 01:37:23,530
Wow. Yeah. So that's, I mean, my problem
is like last night I had, you know,

1779
01:37:23,550 --> 01:37:27,380
skinless grilled chicken,
lettuce, tomatoes, fruit. You know

1780
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:30,220
my question when I read these things,

1781
01:37:30,460 --> 01:37:33,820
when you read a study that says
more evidence against Vitamin News,

1782
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:38,470
my fucking tin foil hat always
goes up. And they always go, well,

1783
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:43,500
how do I not know that this isn't some
shit that the pharmaceutical companies

1784
01:37:43,691 --> 01:37:46,120
have come up with? You
know, to discourage it.

1785
01:37:48,060 --> 01:37:49,590
They found out that if you take vitamins,

1786
01:37:49,591 --> 01:37:53,220
you're less likely to get certain amount
of things that we need drugs to cure.

1787
01:37:53,490 --> 01:37:56,340
And so they're trying to
cycle squash pharmaceutical

1788
01:37:56,370 --> 01:37:56,971
industry.
You know,

1789
01:37:56,971 --> 01:38:00,630
the pharmaceutical industry was trying
at one point in time and they have

1790
01:38:00,631 --> 01:38:02,340
recently tried it again,
they're there.

1791
01:38:02,350 --> 01:38:06,540
They've talked about doing this where
they want to regulate vitamins and

1792
01:38:06,541 --> 01:38:11,250
minerals and they want to make it
so they're only by prescription.

1793
01:38:11,430 --> 01:38:12,100
So they'd go,

1794
01:38:12,100 --> 01:38:14,670
you're going to cost a lot more and
you're going to have to get them from

1795
01:38:14,700 --> 01:38:15,750
pharmaceutical companies.

1796
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:20,660
So instead of these companies like GNC
or all these different places that sell

1797
01:38:20,661 --> 01:38:21,270
vitamins,

1798
01:38:21,270 --> 01:38:24,270
those will essentially be taken over by
the pharmaceutical companies and their

1799
01:38:24,271 --> 01:38:29,130
massive amounts of profits will in
turn be absorbed by the pharmaceutical

1800
01:38:29,131 --> 01:38:31,260
industry.
The pharmaceutical SuiteGL industry,

1801
01:38:31,290 --> 01:38:34,980
by using the American government will
essentially jack the whole nutritional

1802
01:38:34,981 --> 01:38:37,500
market and take it over.
And they tried this in the past.

1803
01:38:37,740 --> 01:38:40,500
They tried to do it under
the name nutriceuticals.
That's what they're going to,

1804
01:38:40,501 --> 01:38:41,910
um,
call vitamins.

1805
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:43,830
And they were going to make it so
that if you wanted to get vitamin C,

1806
01:38:43,831 --> 01:38:47,010
you had to get a fucking prescription.
You had to go through the whole rigmarole,

1807
01:38:47,011 --> 01:38:50,180
you had to go to a doctor, you had
to get a prescription. It's, it's,

1808
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:53,040
it's disgusting. It's, it's,
it's really terrifying.

1809
01:38:53,250 --> 01:38:55,020
And so whenever I see studies like this,

1810
01:38:55,021 --> 01:38:57,540
and I know that this was a
very recently proposed thing,

1811
01:38:57,780 --> 01:39:00,720
I always wonder if they're
jocking for positioning.

1812
01:39:00,750 --> 01:39:04,650
I always wonder what the fuck they're
doing. I really do. Oh, really?

1813
01:39:04,651 --> 01:39:08,670
Do you know? And then you know, once
they take position they'll say, well,

1814
01:39:08,790 --> 01:39:12,990
if you get FDA approved
vitamins and minerals,

1815
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:18,030
it's been shown that moderate doses of
FDA approved vitamin and minerals can

1816
01:39:18,031 --> 01:39:19,950
actually prevent certain diseases.

1817
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:22,710
This is one of the benefits of
having the government take over the

1818
01:39:22,711 --> 01:39:26,040
pharmaceutical industry is that we're
able to run tests on them and get

1819
01:39:26,041 --> 01:39:30,120
conclusive results using taxpayer money.
Now everybody can be safe,

1820
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:34,470
could take government approved vitamins.
So when I hear stories like this,

1821
01:39:34,471 --> 01:39:37,560
I don't necessarily, I don't
believe it. I don't know.

1822
01:39:37,561 --> 01:39:39,240
I don't know who's putting
these fucking things together.

1823
01:39:39,450 --> 01:39:42,810
And I used to think that all these
universities where beyond reproach,

1824
01:39:42,811 --> 01:39:44,400
I just think,
well you know,

1825
01:39:44,401 --> 01:39:49,320
if it's a university study for sure that
means until I watched inside job and

1826
01:39:49,321 --> 01:39:52,920
then I realized how the whole system
works with university professors in the

1827
01:39:52,921 --> 01:39:54,540
fucking studies that they put out.

1828
01:39:54,541 --> 01:39:57,600
And then the cushy jobs did they get
afterwards and they make millions of

1829
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:00,750
dollars by playing ball with
everybody. Did you see inside job? No,

1830
01:40:00,751 --> 01:40:03,120
but I heard about exactly
what you're talking about.

1831
01:40:03,610 --> 01:40:06,450
It just makes me wonder like,
is there an honest,

1832
01:40:06,660 --> 01:40:10,560
is there any honesty left in the world
for anything when you're dealing with

1833
01:40:10,561 --> 01:40:14,250
that kind of money? I think the money
for the professors, millions of dollars.

1834
01:40:14,250 --> 01:40:16,110
All of a sudden they're
working from Merrick, you know,

1835
01:40:16,111 --> 01:40:19,010
and they're developing some fucking,
you know,

1836
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:22,830
brain drug for American making millions
and millions of fucking dog for them.

1837
01:40:22,831 --> 01:40:27,720
It's like the, the numbers are too
high. Yeah. You know, I wonder,

1838
01:40:27,780 --> 01:40:31,140
I wonder if there is anything
on, on corrupt. Just,

1839
01:40:31,380 --> 01:40:34,710
I think the only thing that's going to
save people honestly is there's going to

1840
01:40:34,711 --> 01:40:38,340
have to be some APP that's created
eventually that lets us see the truth.

1841
01:40:38,370 --> 01:40:40,260
Always see the truth and anything.

1842
01:40:40,261 --> 01:40:42,030
No one's ever going to
be able to lie to anyone.

1843
01:40:42,060 --> 01:40:45,180
All your motives will
be exposed right away.

1844
01:40:45,181 --> 01:40:48,050
You'll be forced to tell the truth
and then, and only then are we,

1845
01:40:48,130 --> 01:40:51,620
we're going to really get it together
because half the problem with what it's

1846
01:40:51,630 --> 01:40:56,630
fucked up about human is the lies and the
bullshit in the real motivation behind

1847
01:40:57,281 --> 01:41:00,360
things. Whether it's operation
Northwoods or whether it's, you know,

1848
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:04,240
them trying to fucking take
over the phone. The vitamin
industry under the guys,

1849
01:41:04,241 --> 01:41:06,610
they're trying to help us.
Nobody's, let me tell you something.

1850
01:41:06,620 --> 01:41:10,480
Nobody's dying from fucking
vitamins. No body, no body,

1851
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:14,680
a negligible amount. 10,000 people
die from fucking caffeine every year.

1852
01:41:14,860 --> 01:41:16,450
All right.
And I love coffee.

1853
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:21,220
Who knows how many thousands of people
die from aspirins 400,000 die from

1854
01:41:21,221 --> 01:41:25,240
cigarettes. Just shut the fuck up,
right? If they're going after something,

1855
01:41:25,241 --> 01:41:26,770
they're going after it for money.

1856
01:41:26,980 --> 01:41:30,040
The federal government is not trying
to take over the cigarette industry.

1857
01:41:30,190 --> 01:41:32,320
They're not trying to give you only
government approves cigarettes.

1858
01:41:32,321 --> 01:41:35,260
You need a prescription to get cigarettes
cause we're worried about the dangers

1859
01:41:35,261 --> 01:41:35,920
of cigarettes.

1860
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:38,710
They don't think twice about cigarettes
cause the tobacco company pays them

1861
01:41:38,711 --> 01:41:42,040
billions of fucking dollars.
Those dirty, dirty cunts.

1862
01:41:42,460 --> 01:41:46,090
So the truth APP is the way to go. We
need a truth APP, Brian, until you,

1863
01:41:46,091 --> 01:41:49,930
until somebody figures
out how to manipulate that
hack, it's money off of it.

1864
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:52,690
Of course, the whole don't make it a
fucking bought bought for the truth APP.

1865
01:41:55,180 --> 01:41:56,860
What's the solution? Brian? I don't know.

1866
01:41:57,100 --> 01:42:00,860
Thinking about how crazy that it, if
you really think about it, it's there.

1867
01:42:00,890 --> 01:42:01,820
There's a creator,

1868
01:42:01,821 --> 01:42:06,170
there's somebody did that created the
human person and whatever and they had to

1869
01:42:06,310 --> 01:42:09,650
like take the eye and try to like
design the eye to make it the best,

1870
01:42:09,651 --> 01:42:13,530
most efficient I and somebody created
the nos like no, it has to be, you know,

1871
01:42:13,610 --> 01:42:18,140
has to have these filters of hair so
it collects dust before they inhale it.

1872
01:42:18,141 --> 01:42:21,220
You know,
it's amazing that they're pro there.

1873
01:42:21,230 --> 01:42:24,230
Is there somebody that sat around and
had to design every single part of the

1874
01:42:24,231 --> 01:42:26,750
human person? No, there's not one person.

1875
01:42:26,980 --> 01:42:30,860
It's not a jet team of scientists and
they created these robots and we're robots

1876
01:42:30,870 --> 01:42:31,703
and

1877
01:42:32,490 --> 01:42:35,370
you know, there's the question of whether
or not there's intelligent design.

1878
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:39,470
There's some pretty intelligent people
that believe in intelligent design and a,

1879
01:42:39,500 --> 01:42:40,680
the idea behind it,

1880
01:42:40,770 --> 01:42:44,070
everybody has a big red flag when you
bring it up because it's been co opted by

1881
01:42:44,071 --> 01:42:45,640
religious groups and they,
they,

1882
01:42:45,650 --> 01:42:50,040
they use it to sort of promote the idea
in school that you can push religious

1883
01:42:50,041 --> 01:42:54,060
nonsense on kids because the real problem,
religious nonsense is not that.

1884
01:42:54,090 --> 01:42:56,220
It's not possible.
What they're saying is true.

1885
01:42:56,250 --> 01:42:59,310
It's that there's no evidence that it's
true. And they're basically just talking.

1886
01:42:59,610 --> 01:43:01,920
They basically just making up
a bunch of fucking stories.

1887
01:43:02,100 --> 01:43:03,900
Somebody wrote it down and you know,

1888
01:43:03,901 --> 01:43:06,930
they try to pretend that it's history
and they try to sell it to kids.

1889
01:43:07,050 --> 01:43:10,080
There's no fucking evidence. But it
doesn't mean it's not right. It doesn't,

1890
01:43:10,081 --> 01:43:13,170
it does. It doesn't mean that there
isn't, you know, at one point in time,

1891
01:43:13,171 --> 01:43:18,171
some benevolent you one power
that oversees everything.

1892
01:43:18,991 --> 01:43:22,020
But we have eyelashes to protect our eyes.
I mean,

1893
01:43:22,021 --> 01:43:26,670
with each piece of crocodiles, what
would they make? Komodo dragons.

1894
01:43:26,671 --> 01:43:28,250
Why would they make monkeys throw shit at,
you know,

1895
01:43:29,110 --> 01:43:33,560
so those were all like
revision B, c, d e. Well,

1896
01:43:33,630 --> 01:43:36,770
I think there's a, is there some sort
of an ecosystem but does anything,

1897
01:43:36,771 --> 01:43:37,980
it looks alien.
It's us.

1898
01:43:38,160 --> 01:43:42,720
If you really want it to make the argument
and there is this a logical argument

1899
01:43:42,990 --> 01:43:46,260
if you really want to make the argument
that there has been genetic engineering,

1900
01:43:46,290 --> 01:43:50,490
there's two animals that you'd make that
argument with dogs and people and dogs

1901
01:43:50,491 --> 01:43:52,250
and people both very

1902
01:43:52,310 --> 01:43:57,310
substantially in size and
shape and coloring and the
what the where they live on

1903
01:43:57,801 --> 01:43:58,670
the on the earth.

1904
01:43:59,060 --> 01:44:03,080
But you can make them fuck each other
and they can have babies no matter what.

1905
01:44:03,081 --> 01:44:06,200
They're all interchangeable. Midgets
can fucked Shaquille O'Neal, you know,

1906
01:44:06,201 --> 01:44:09,130
you can, you could figure out a way to
put it all together. It's, it's a way,

1907
01:44:09,650 --> 01:44:10,050
you know,

1908
01:44:10,050 --> 01:44:13,730
there's only people in dogs and we know
for a fact the only reason why dogs are

1909
01:44:13,731 --> 01:44:15,470
like that is cause
people fucked with them.

1910
01:44:15,471 --> 01:44:19,340
But people through selective breeding
and some sort of genetic engineering that

1911
01:44:19,341 --> 01:44:21,050
they're really don't know
and a bunch of people,

1912
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:25,280
thank you have sent me a
bunch of documentaries on
dogs that a problem I'm not

1913
01:44:25,281 --> 01:44:28,670
going to watch. I just watched
one last night. Interesting.

1914
01:44:28,671 --> 01:44:32,360
Dogs dissect it or something like that.
It's something I'm from wolves. Yeah.

1915
01:44:32,361 --> 01:44:36,200
They come from words. But how like also
like when humans look at each other,

1916
01:44:36,201 --> 01:44:39,310
they like look from left to right
for some reason to like, uh,

1917
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:42,170
to judge you or I forget
what it was about,

1918
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:46,770
but that dogs also did it and then that
we actually think closer to the dogs and

1919
01:44:46,790 --> 01:44:50,960
most chimpanzees or, or monkey.
And it was really weird.

1920
01:44:50,961 --> 01:44:54,710
It was interesting to the see did
they only bark like it though?

1921
01:44:55,130 --> 01:44:57,560
They're not designed to bark Burgum.

1922
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:00,470
They're designed a bark were like wolves
don't sit around and bark all day.

1923
01:45:00,590 --> 01:45:04,430
Right. Yeah. Where that dogs are trying
to communicate with humans and stuff.

1924
01:45:04,431 --> 01:45:07,100
It was really interesting. You know,
wolves communicate with people too.

1925
01:45:07,101 --> 01:45:10,400
If you have a wolf, the for a pet. I have
a friend that, uh, has, uh, two wolves.

1926
01:45:10,401 --> 01:45:13,460
He had three for awhile and the
wolves fucking talk to you, man.

1927
01:45:13,580 --> 01:45:14,390
You come home and you're like,

1928
01:45:14,390 --> 01:45:18,860
what's up dude? What's up
dude? They go, Whoa, whoa.

1929
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:23,250
They look like they're all on wolves.
While there there's something, you know,

1930
01:45:23,251 --> 01:45:27,150
probably seven eighths Timberwolf they're
really tricky. The real tricky pets.

1931
01:45:27,151 --> 01:45:31,140
Like once you, you're around them, you
go, okay, well this isn't a dog dude. You,

1932
01:45:31,141 --> 01:45:33,370
you live with an animal,
you live with a totally different animal.

1933
01:45:33,410 --> 01:45:36,990
It's just not a dog. It's a wise we
a grizzly man. Shit man, it's close.

1934
01:45:36,991 --> 01:45:38,520
Except they don't really attack people.

1935
01:45:38,521 --> 01:45:41,490
I mean they can if they're treated
badly and if they're, you know,

1936
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:43,830
if they're in a bad environment
for the most part was, you know,

1937
01:45:43,890 --> 01:45:46,770
Timberwolf seven I don't have
a problem with their master's,

1938
01:45:46,771 --> 01:45:50,610
at least in any dog could have a problem
with someone else. Another person,

1939
01:45:50,611 --> 01:45:54,180
little kids, sometimes scary. Do you
think the little kids aren't our animals?

1940
01:45:54,390 --> 01:45:56,580
It's a real danger.
Some of the funniest shit.

1941
01:45:56,581 --> 01:46:01,170
My Dad had a friend who would come over
the nicest guy in the world, but our dog,

1942
01:46:01,171 --> 01:46:05,240
Larry didn't like the sound of his voice
and she would just bark like crazy,

1943
01:46:05,260 --> 01:46:07,560
just Rah Rah Rah and,
and like try to attack him.

1944
01:46:07,740 --> 01:46:11,460
But she was the nicest dog to everyone.
And this dude for whatever reason,

1945
01:46:11,461 --> 01:46:13,170
just come over and she would attack him.
Wow.

1946
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:14,570
He probably fucked her
when you weren't looking.

1947
01:46:14,590 --> 01:46:19,050
Probably it's probably was always
fucking that poor dog. But you know,

1948
01:46:19,170 --> 01:46:23,290
the idea is that human beings
were genetically engineered
by higher power that

1949
01:46:23,291 --> 01:46:25,360
something came down here
and genetically engineered.

1950
01:46:25,650 --> 01:46:29,310
That's why we look so different than
anything else on the planet. You know,

1951
01:46:29,311 --> 01:46:34,110
we are so different than any other
primate. Our skin is soft and fleshy.

1952
01:46:34,410 --> 01:46:38,190
For the longest time we've been using
tools to the point where we can't even

1953
01:46:38,191 --> 01:46:42,210
remember. We just have to Kinda like look
at old stuff and trying to figure out,

1954
01:46:42,211 --> 01:46:43,980
they have tools then how
think they had on that.

1955
01:46:43,981 --> 01:46:47,490
And they just recently moved it
back way, way, way, way, way back.

1956
01:46:47,730 --> 01:46:50,250
They moved the dawn civilization back

1957
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:55,250
almost 6,000 years really recently because
they found this huge structure and go

1958
01:46:55,531 --> 01:46:57,120
Beckley, Tempe. And they,

1959
01:46:57,150 --> 01:47:00,810
they used to think that back then people
were just living in caves and they had

1960
01:47:00,811 --> 01:47:05,460
these 19 foot tall carved stone
columns with animals on them.

1961
01:47:05,461 --> 01:47:09,780
And then this is like 12,000 years ago.
So to put in perspective,

1962
01:47:10,530 --> 01:47:14,910
ancient Sumeria was thought to
be the cradle of civilization.

1963
01:47:14,911 --> 01:47:19,590
That was the oldest known civilization
that we knew of that 6,000 years ago in

1964
01:47:19,591 --> 01:47:23,520
Iraq.
This is 6,000 years older than that.

1965
01:47:23,730 --> 01:47:26,490
So to them in ancient Sumeria,

1966
01:47:26,790 --> 01:47:30,630
it was to them go Beckley Tapley
was like Sumeria is to us,

1967
01:47:30,631 --> 01:47:33,510
which is impossible to even
wrap your head around where it,

1968
01:47:33,530 --> 01:47:35,470
what is the Biblioteca?
It's,

1969
01:47:35,471 --> 01:47:40,260
it's called go Beckley Tepi and it's
in Turkey. It's really an amazing,

1970
01:47:40,261 --> 01:47:43,650
amazing stuff. Yeah. They just,
I mean this is recent. This was,

1971
01:47:43,680 --> 01:47:47,130
the guy found this in
the 1990s. He was a, uh,

1972
01:47:47,190 --> 01:47:50,400
some farmer and he's fucking
digging in his backyard and Turkey.

1973
01:47:50,580 --> 01:47:53,910
It's like a goat herder or some shit.
And he found like some thing sticking up.

1974
01:47:53,911 --> 01:47:54,870
It's like,
what the fuck is this?

1975
01:47:55,160 --> 01:47:59,910
And it turns out there's all these
giant fucking stone circles of the huge

1976
01:47:59,911 --> 01:48:01,980
columns and shit all on his land,

1977
01:48:02,100 --> 01:48:05,400
all his land and all done like way,
way,

1978
01:48:05,401 --> 01:48:08,640
way before they thought anybody
was doing anything like this.

1979
01:48:08,641 --> 01:48:11,640
They had to rewrite the whole
situation because of this stuff.

1980
01:48:11,970 --> 01:48:13,950
They thought people were just
hunter gatherers back then.

1981
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:16,600
So there's still trying to attribute
it somehow to a hunter gatherers,

1982
01:48:16,620 --> 01:48:20,590
but it doesn't make sense. Right,
right. Temple. Yeah, good luck.

1983
01:48:20,630 --> 01:48:23,730
It's just fucking crazy.
Giant stone carved temple.

1984
01:48:23,970 --> 01:48:25,860
And you want to tell me
that people who made this,

1985
01:48:25,861 --> 01:48:29,580
we're just running around chasing animals.
It blows me away that over time,

1986
01:48:29,581 --> 01:48:34,581
that much dirt and just shit has just
piled up to cover that temple and that

1987
01:48:34,651 --> 01:48:36,600
it's just on some dude's farmland.
Well,

1988
01:48:36,601 --> 01:48:39,720
actually this one I think they
believe was covered over on purpose.

1989
01:48:39,930 --> 01:48:43,560
They believe that a, that someone at
some point in time actually covered it.

1990
01:48:43,830 --> 01:48:47,010
Oh really? Yeah, because because of the
nature of the dirt that's covering it,

1991
01:48:47,060 --> 01:48:48,420
they believe that it's,
uh,

1992
01:48:48,750 --> 01:48:52,020
it's actually a artificial that
someone brought it in and covered it.

1993
01:48:52,050 --> 01:48:56,080
Covered up the stone structures under
the ancient backhoe. Yeah. Ain't shit.

1994
01:48:56,740 --> 01:48:59,880
It's dogs. A lot of dudes who
listened to him. That's what it is.

1995
01:49:00,240 --> 01:49:02,350
That was your number one
resource back then? Yeah.

1996
01:49:02,410 --> 01:49:04,980
But the slaves who built the
pyramids, they're like, oh,

1997
01:49:04,981 --> 01:49:06,640
we've got another project was so,

1998
01:49:06,660 --> 01:49:10,590
so what we are talking about then was
like 12,000 years. That's how long,

1999
01:49:10,600 --> 01:49:14,190
long time ago.
But even then it just doesn't make sense.

2000
01:49:14,191 --> 01:49:16,470
Like how the fuck where did,
where did this animal come from?

2001
01:49:16,471 --> 01:49:19,080
How'd his hand will get so much
different than all these other monkeys?

2002
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:21,630
How did to figure out tools,
how did it figure out language?

2003
01:49:21,631 --> 01:49:23,550
Why is it so different?
Why is it so different?

2004
01:49:23,551 --> 01:49:28,260
Its ability to communicate ideas that
just somehow or another the aliens came

2005
01:49:28,261 --> 01:49:29,310
down and said,
God,

2006
01:49:29,311 --> 01:49:32,340
you know how long it's going to take
for these fucking monkeys to ever figure

2007
01:49:32,341 --> 01:49:35,550
out anything. It could take billions
of years and it can never happen.

2008
01:49:35,551 --> 01:49:39,020
They could go extinct. Look,
they live outside. They
haven't even figured out five.

2009
01:49:39,030 --> 01:49:40,260
This might not ever work out.

2010
01:49:40,440 --> 01:49:43,770
They might catch some crazy infection
or there might be some spider that's

2011
01:49:43,771 --> 01:49:46,770
fucking toxic that likes to live in
their sheets and eats them alive.

2012
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:49,300
You know there might be no chance
of these monkeys making it.

2013
01:49:49,330 --> 01:49:50,140
How about we do this?

2014
01:49:50,140 --> 01:49:54,400
How about we just inject a little of
our DNA and just spice up the process a

2015
01:49:54,401 --> 01:49:58,970
little bit. And that's the
idea. That's the idea that,

2016
01:49:58,971 --> 01:50:00,560
and that's the,
I'll also the idea of,

2017
01:50:00,561 --> 01:50:03,770
there's a guy named Zechariah Cichon
and he wrote all these books about this

2018
01:50:03,771 --> 01:50:07,700
shit about the ancient Sumerians had
written this very controversial stuff,

2019
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:11,240
but it's all about the Sumerian text and
how the Annunaki we're on this planet

2020
01:50:11,241 --> 01:50:13,640
that's in an elliptical
orbit and every 3000,

2021
01:50:13,641 --> 01:50:17,780
600 years it comes near our planet and
they hop off and fucking come hangout

2022
01:50:17,810 --> 01:50:21,060
with us for a little,
show us some shit and then disappeared.

2023
01:50:21,670 --> 01:50:24,930
And then by the time 3000, 600 years
rolls around, we forgot about it again.

2024
01:50:25,580 --> 01:50:30,200
When are we do probably like a week
or so if you just got to get online,

2025
01:50:30,230 --> 01:50:33,880
probably December 21st, 2012. Yeah,
right. That's probably the, uh,

2026
01:50:34,030 --> 01:50:36,530
one of the people think that there's
the people that believe there's a planet

2027
01:50:36,531 --> 01:50:38,870
out there and it's headed our way.
They can't see it yet,

2028
01:50:39,050 --> 01:50:41,120
but it's getting our way and it's giant.

2029
01:50:41,360 --> 01:50:44,210
What's really scary is that that
definitely can happen. You know,

2030
01:50:44,211 --> 01:50:47,600
planets get hit by planets all the
time in the solar system. Right.

2031
01:50:47,630 --> 01:50:49,670
Or in the universe rather.
It hasn't happened.

2032
01:50:49,700 --> 01:50:52,640
We know it's happening in certain parts
of our solar system I can think is

2033
01:50:52,641 --> 01:50:55,670
Uranus is spinning upside down.
Is it

2034
01:50:57,590 --> 01:51:00,050
one of them? One of the planets
is spinning like the, the,

2035
01:51:00,051 --> 01:51:03,470
the ravens are going the wrong way
and they believe more than likely it's

2036
01:51:03,471 --> 01:51:05,600
because it got fucking
nails by another planet.

2037
01:51:06,860 --> 01:51:09,580
They just fly into each other
and shit. Oh, that was hilarious.

2038
01:51:10,010 --> 01:51:13,370
That happened at Earth Earth. One in earth
too. That's how the moon was created.

2039
01:51:13,640 --> 01:51:18,590
Earth one like 4 billion years ago got
hit with some Mara size planet and just

2040
01:51:18,620 --> 01:51:22,700
slammed into us and knocked off a
fucking slab and that created the moon.

2041
01:51:25,460 --> 01:51:28,910
Useless Astronomy Mano La.

2042
01:51:31,210 --> 01:51:32,950
That was your last, uh, Thursday night.

2043
01:51:33,570 --> 01:51:36,230
Yes. Yeah. On the Internet
with this. No, man, I,

2044
01:51:36,300 --> 01:51:38,400
I've been obsessed with
all this shit forever.

2045
01:51:38,760 --> 01:51:40,050
That's what I love about you dude.

2046
01:51:40,051 --> 01:51:42,930
You're able to like retain
all this shit like from,

2047
01:51:42,931 --> 01:51:44,310
I don't remember anything man.

2048
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:46,440
Well you would if it was
interesting to you. This, this,

2049
01:51:46,441 --> 01:51:48,600
this stuff is absolutely
fascinating to me.

2050
01:51:48,601 --> 01:51:50,870
So I retain all sorts of stupid
shit when it comes to that.

2051
01:51:51,090 --> 01:51:52,230
I find it fascinating,

2052
01:51:52,231 --> 01:51:55,020
but I'll get into an article and I'll
read like three sentences and then go make

2053
01:51:55,021 --> 01:51:56,130
a sandwich and I forget what I was,

2054
01:51:56,960 --> 01:52:01,730
you know, get some Alpha brain new
system from rain sun. Don't get scared.

2055
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:06,320
Don't be scared of the Alpha brain.
Eat shroom tech and your feet.

2056
01:52:06,620 --> 01:52:08,570
Would you be for brain in your
head and you're not working?

2057
01:52:08,571 --> 01:52:11,210
Do you sit around and watch
documentaries? Like, do you ever,

2058
01:52:11,510 --> 01:52:14,620
do you ever like purposely sit down and
go, okay, I'm going to watch grizzly man.

2059
01:52:14,621 --> 01:52:17,090
I'm gonna get some fucking material out
of this. Do you ever do you do shit?

2060
01:52:17,110 --> 01:52:21,800
I don't sit down to get
material? No. You'd never know.
Do you write when, when you,

2061
01:52:21,801 --> 01:52:24,160
uh, write your standup, do you sit
down and go, come on over, sit down.

2062
01:52:24,161 --> 01:52:27,920
I'm gonna write some stand
up. Yeah. You do. Yeah. Do
you force yourself to do that?

2063
01:52:27,950 --> 01:52:29,990
Yeah.
How many times a week to try to do it.

2064
01:52:30,850 --> 01:52:34,340
Uh, if it's good, it's five
days a week. Wow. Good for you.

2065
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:38,960
And it went from 45 minutes a
day to an hour because I figure,

2066
01:52:38,961 --> 01:52:41,270
I felt like an hour was out of reach,

2067
01:52:41,271 --> 01:52:45,380
but I could do 45 minutes and then a
lot of times I would end up going hour

2068
01:52:45,381 --> 01:52:45,980
anyway,

2069
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:48,590
so then I would just go for
an hour. But then, you know,

2070
01:52:48,591 --> 01:52:52,100
when Shit just starts getting busy,
I don't sit down and maybe once a week,

2071
01:52:52,280 --> 01:52:54,770
you know, but so much. Right.
I don't sit down and go,

2072
01:52:54,771 --> 01:52:56,150
I'm going to go create all this stuff.

2073
01:52:56,151 --> 01:53:00,110
A lot of it's just like going over old
stuff, tightening it up, make it funnier.

2074
01:53:00,250 --> 01:53:03,490
Have like, I have a bank of old
shit that I'll open up a file.

2075
01:53:03,510 --> 01:53:04,343
You're gonna never did anything.

2076
01:53:05,450 --> 01:53:07,040
Is there anything in there?
I got that.

2077
01:53:07,041 --> 01:53:10,250
I got the tape recorder that I always
am still rocking a tape recorder.

2078
01:53:10,280 --> 01:53:12,050
It's digital.
It's great cause it uh,

2079
01:53:12,310 --> 01:53:14,870
I just dump it in and it's an MP
three and then I listened to it on my

2080
01:53:14,871 --> 01:53:15,740
headphones or whatever.

2081
01:53:15,790 --> 01:53:18,250
I used to do that until I
got an iPhone and the iPhone,

2082
01:53:18,460 --> 01:53:20,500
iPhone voice recorder
app is so much better.

2083
01:53:20,501 --> 01:53:24,660
I can actually write in the name of
what I thought of like that, you know,

2084
01:53:24,680 --> 01:53:28,510
a blue smurf, Dick boom.
And then that's like,

2085
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:32,470
you look at it and you can go right to
the voice note and you can have Siri play

2086
01:53:32,471 --> 01:53:37,090
it. You could have say, Siri, play
me Blue Smurf Dick and it'll play it.

2087
01:53:37,390 --> 01:53:39,550
I just got the iPhone now so I don't even,

2088
01:53:40,390 --> 01:53:43,150
I mean I know about that stuff but
he just got it. Are you a newb?

2089
01:53:43,420 --> 01:53:47,230
I'm a newb voice notes is in there.
It's free. It's a free APP. I know,

2090
01:53:47,231 --> 01:53:50,110
but I mean it's like I have this, I spent
the money for this. I'm going to use it.

2091
01:53:50,111 --> 01:53:52,890
Cause it doesn't throw that into
the crowd when someone angers you.

2092
01:53:53,630 --> 01:53:56,110
That's the other cool thing about that.

2093
01:53:56,110 --> 01:53:58,330
The iPhone is you can
record all of your sets.

2094
01:53:58,570 --> 01:54:00,670
I record all my stats on the
voice thing and it doesn't,

2095
01:54:00,671 --> 01:54:03,940
you just make sure that you put it on
airplane mode so it doesn't get a phone

2096
01:54:03,941 --> 01:54:05,040
call.
Cause if you get a phone

2097
01:54:05,140 --> 01:54:08,320
cause there was a good that it'll kill
you. It'll kill the recording. Oh really?

2098
01:54:08,350 --> 01:54:12,700
Stops it. Stops it debt. Use Evernote. If
you haven't started that, that's awesome.

2099
01:54:12,701 --> 01:54:15,370
It's a program where you can type
your notes up on your computer and it

2100
01:54:15,371 --> 01:54:17,320
automatically just sinks it with your,
your,

2101
01:54:17,620 --> 01:54:19,660
you have to have mobile me
for that though. No, no.

2102
01:54:19,661 --> 01:54:23,620
This is a free app in the APP store
and evernotes on evernote.com I think.

2103
01:54:23,660 --> 01:54:24,760
And yeah,
Evernote

2104
01:54:24,780 --> 01:54:29,630
work with um, the, the new voice software
on apple. Can you talk to Evernote?

2105
01:54:29,660 --> 01:54:33,710
Evernote has its own recorder built
into the program, but it's a recording.

2106
01:54:33,711 --> 01:54:37,520
It's not a translation.
It's not transcript transcription.

2107
01:54:37,521 --> 01:54:40,640
So I don't think so because the
droids have like transcription.

2108
01:54:40,641 --> 01:54:43,790
Should they have it to different things?
Yeah, they have with dragon I think,

2109
01:54:43,791 --> 01:54:48,110
but or you can do it on Siri. You know
what I'm saying is like you don't know.

2110
01:54:48,200 --> 01:54:50,690
I don't know. Someone out there
will know. But if you can,

2111
01:54:50,691 --> 01:54:52,190
that would be a good move for Evernote.

2112
01:54:52,310 --> 01:54:54,980
We could talk to it and actually
writes it down, you know,

2113
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:57,220
instead of just recording it.
Yeah.

2114
01:54:57,520 --> 01:55:00,230
Cause then it wouldn't be any
better than voice recorder. Right.

2115
01:55:00,370 --> 01:55:03,470
You know Neal Brennan, do you know Neil
Brown? Huh? He had a great line about,

2116
01:55:03,500 --> 01:55:07,010
about having something like
a piece of paper or you know,

2117
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:09,740
having a voice recorder when
you're a comic and he goes,

2118
01:55:09,741 --> 01:55:13,880
it's like I'm fishing for ideas and I
catch one in my net and if I don't write

2119
01:55:13,881 --> 01:55:17,090
it down, it's going to get away. You
know? It was like, but I write it down,

2120
01:55:17,130 --> 01:55:20,360
then I've caught it forever. It's
in my net. And I'm like, yeah, yeah.

2121
01:55:20,380 --> 01:55:24,200
It is like sometimes it's just the
discipline to sit down and write shit out

2122
01:55:24,440 --> 01:55:28,370
because the discipline to write shit
out is such a different mindset than the

2123
01:55:28,371 --> 01:55:30,260
mindset that comes up
with something silly.

2124
01:55:30,500 --> 01:55:33,770
Like you'll come up with
something hilarious and
ridiculous and that mindset is

2125
01:55:33,771 --> 01:55:37,640
just like this shit talking.
Good time fucking around mindset.

2126
01:55:37,880 --> 01:55:41,090
And then the other mindset is we might
be able to make money off this year and

2127
01:55:41,091 --> 01:55:44,970
it's just this little piece of gold we
got here. Make sure what type this up.

2128
01:55:45,150 --> 01:55:47,520
You know, it's a, it's funny
how uh, they're, they're,

2129
01:55:47,530 --> 01:55:50,670
they're both completely different
mindsets where it's like we know a lot of

2130
01:55:50,671 --> 01:55:53,790
funny people that like never
write their shit down. You know,

2131
01:55:55,100 --> 01:55:58,380
it's, I'm a better comic when I
do that and when I don't, I, I

2132
01:55:58,810 --> 01:56:01,900
deck man. I always tell everybody that
man, I was like, just two jobs man.

2133
01:56:01,901 --> 01:56:05,890
One job is performing. There's another
job. It's writing. You have to do both.

2134
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:08,870
If you just try to come up with only
shit on stage and that's improving it on

2135
01:56:08,871 --> 01:56:13,020
stage, you can do that. And I've done that
for years. I did that for a long time.

2136
01:56:13,050 --> 01:56:15,940
I did, I just only worked
on my material on stage.

2137
01:56:15,941 --> 01:56:18,190
But this was like pre internet days,
you know,

2138
01:56:18,191 --> 01:56:21,560
this is much less people
that have access to your,

2139
01:56:21,561 --> 01:56:24,550
your material if you want to like
continue to process new shit,

2140
01:56:24,940 --> 01:56:26,650
come up with new good stuff.
You've got it right.

2141
01:56:26,720 --> 01:56:30,910
I got it. Yeah, that stuff is fine, but
if you are sitting down to do it too,

2142
01:56:30,911 --> 01:56:31,231
that's,

2143
01:56:31,231 --> 01:56:35,710
that's the way to go because it doesn't
exclude the ability to add live on stage.

2144
01:56:35,890 --> 01:56:38,950
This whole ton of bitch only writes on
stage. She told me, you know who that is?

2145
01:56:39,480 --> 01:56:43,180
He's just a comic, but it's she suck.
No, she's funny. She's hilarious.

2146
01:56:43,181 --> 01:56:47,920
She's really funny. Um, but
she only writes on stage and
I was just like, I can't,

2147
01:56:47,921 --> 01:56:49,870
she goes, well, I just can't sit
down and write. And it's like,

2148
01:56:49,871 --> 01:56:51,700
well you got to force yourself to do that.
Yeah.

2149
01:56:51,820 --> 01:56:54,730
Our nobody wants to know why
are you so never read a stage.

2150
01:56:54,820 --> 01:56:57,430
I used to tell him my or only
write on stage. I just tell him,

2151
01:56:57,431 --> 01:56:59,590
did you sit down and write
man or road on storage?

2152
01:57:02,200 --> 01:57:05,700
That's not writing, dude,
that's performing. You're
lazy. But this is the same guy.

2153
01:57:05,701 --> 01:57:08,700
It didn't clean the sheets for six
months. Sure. Literally, there's,

2154
01:57:08,710 --> 01:57:12,610
when you're doing a bit like I'll do bits
that I've done for years and all of a

2155
01:57:12,611 --> 01:57:14,410
sudden I come up with a new tag on stage.

2156
01:57:14,411 --> 01:57:16,900
Like that new tag was only
going to come out on stage,

2157
01:57:16,901 --> 01:57:19,750
not when I'm sitting down
in my underwear or whatever.

2158
01:57:19,970 --> 01:57:20,271
Yeah.

2159
01:57:20,271 --> 01:57:23,450
And isn't it weird that you forget the
tag and then you'll be back in the bit

2160
01:57:23,451 --> 01:57:26,810
and go, Oh, here it is.
It goes right here. Yeah.

2161
01:57:27,710 --> 01:57:31,250
Taglines for folks who don't know, they're
like a little gift from the universe.

2162
01:57:31,500 --> 01:57:33,270
So like you'll be on stage,
you've got this perf,

2163
01:57:33,290 --> 01:57:36,200
I've had jokes that I thought were,
I was like, I really liked this joke.

2164
01:57:36,380 --> 01:57:40,520
And then you have a tagline, boom. And
it's like, oh, now this joke's a weapon.

2165
01:57:40,680 --> 01:57:43,490
And then now this joke is just hit
some critical mass. You're like,

2166
01:57:43,491 --> 01:57:47,630
this joke is good, it's done. No it's
not. I've never done. Do you, um,

2167
01:57:47,660 --> 01:57:49,850
do you have like a schedule?
Like what you try to do,

2168
01:57:49,851 --> 01:57:51,890
like put out shit for
like a couple of years,

2169
01:57:52,040 --> 01:57:56,120
put it down on a CD and then like try
to write a whole new schedule or a whole

2170
01:57:56,121 --> 01:57:58,740
new act. No, I want to
get to that point. Yeah.

2171
01:57:58,820 --> 01:58:02,030
I've been recently just recently
doing that over the last few years.

2172
01:58:02,031 --> 01:58:05,420
My last few specials have done that where
I've banned in one and start another

2173
01:58:05,421 --> 01:58:10,100
one. It's a good US forces you to get
after it. Yeah. Cause right now, dude,

2174
01:58:10,101 --> 01:58:14,230
I'm still doing shit from my
second year of comedy. Which Elle,

2175
01:58:14,240 --> 01:58:18,860
how long have you been in when we met
you? Uh, when did we meet? Like 2004,

2176
01:58:18,861 --> 01:58:23,100
2005, somewhere around there. Had
I done last comic yet? Do you know,

2177
01:58:23,140 --> 01:58:27,980
know before last time. And I think it
was like 2005 or it might've been four.

2178
01:58:28,430 --> 01:58:32,420
It was, uh, it was during the dark
joy Diaz days and what it meant.

2179
01:58:32,850 --> 01:58:34,670
So Joey Diaz,
I've told this story before,

2180
01:58:34,671 --> 01:58:37,820
I used to only bring one guy on
the road with me because you know,

2181
01:58:37,821 --> 01:58:40,970
I do like an hour and 20 minutes or
whatever. I don't really, I only need one.

2182
01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:42,431
And you know,

2183
01:58:42,431 --> 01:58:45,760
it's fun traveling with one comic
sometimes when you're traveling with two

2184
01:58:45,761 --> 01:58:49,780
comics, like I got to get organized.
Like we lost Brendan Walsh in Houston.

2185
01:58:49,810 --> 01:58:53,230
Perfect example. We got up in the
morning, Brendan Walsh, buzzard awake.

2186
01:58:53,260 --> 01:58:55,390
He just wouldn't fucking wake up.
Call this room when,

2187
01:58:55,480 --> 01:58:57,460
so we're trying to figure out how
to get the fuck to the airport.

2188
01:58:57,461 --> 01:59:00,910
And we had a band in Brendan Walsh
we had even behind but with jelly.

2189
01:59:00,930 --> 01:59:05,560
I just could never be sure he was going
to show up. I never knew it. Never knew.

2190
01:59:05,561 --> 01:59:08,380
And Phoenix was a perfect example.
He didn't show up.

2191
01:59:08,410 --> 01:59:12,430
He was supposed to go to Phoenix and
he's just fucking slipped in between the

2192
01:59:12,431 --> 01:59:13,264
howling.

2193
01:59:13,430 --> 01:59:16,910
You did like a Thursday
night show it at Tempe. Yeah.

2194
01:59:16,911 --> 01:59:18,770
And then there it was so fucking weird,

2195
01:59:18,771 --> 01:59:23,260
like after your show they had some weird
contest or whatever that Danny Maher

2196
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:27,080
asked me to, to do. I don't even know
what the fuck it was. Four. And uh,

2197
01:59:27,660 --> 01:59:30,710
and so the whole crowd stayed you that
you'd like sold out Thursday night?

2198
01:59:31,010 --> 01:59:35,090
The whole crowd's stayed in the first
comic who went up just ate dog shit.

2199
01:59:35,260 --> 01:59:36,620
I don't even know who she was.
I mean,

2200
01:59:36,621 --> 01:59:40,190
just some horrible comic and like half
the crowd gets up and walks out and I was

2201
01:59:40,191 --> 01:59:44,060
like, and I'm last of this group
of people. I'm like, fuck this.

2202
01:59:44,330 --> 01:59:45,260
And then I remember,
I see,

2203
01:59:45,261 --> 01:59:48,740
I saw you sit down to eat a meal after
the show and you're sitting there and,

2204
01:59:48,790 --> 01:59:51,020
and you were even turning the Dan,
you're like, why? Why are they,

2205
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:54,560
what is the show going on?
Like what did I finish the show now?

2206
01:59:54,561 --> 01:59:57,950
There's another show and the socks and
everybody in the audience and everyone's

2207
01:59:57,951 --> 01:59:58,960
like walking up and leaving.

2208
01:59:58,980 --> 02:00:02,960
And I got back up and there was like 12
people in the crowd and I was like, shit,

2209
02:00:02,990 --> 02:00:06,200
I was so pissed. I didn't give a fuck
anymore. So I started doing my jokes,

2210
02:00:06,201 --> 02:00:08,000
but like,
people were laughing,

2211
02:00:08,001 --> 02:00:11,000
but I heard you laughing the loudest
from the back. I was like, oh,

2212
02:00:11,001 --> 02:00:14,300
well this was a victory for tonight. And
then you had asked me, you're like, Hey,

2213
02:00:14,600 --> 02:00:18,290
can you uh, open for me the rest of
the weekend? Because it's a Joey Diaz.

2214
02:00:18,300 --> 02:00:22,610
Is it here? Yeah, that's how we met.
That was like two, it was like 2004,

2215
02:00:22,611 --> 02:00:27,611
but that was maybe my first
show was February of 2003.

2216
02:00:27,860 --> 02:00:31,130
Oh, so it was, yeah. You were really
recent rash. Yeah. You were really fresh,

2217
02:00:31,131 --> 02:00:35,420
I think you'd said you just been doing it
a year. Yeah, it was like a tight seven,

2218
02:00:35,421 --> 02:00:36,740
which was good.
You know?

2219
02:00:37,180 --> 02:00:40,150
Great job, man. For someone who
never performed, like, you know,

2220
02:00:40,160 --> 02:00:44,720
in that sort of a situation on a weekend,
a paid show, what's the difference?

2221
02:00:44,740 --> 02:00:47,550
A page shows a big difference.
You know, when people pay,

2222
02:00:47,590 --> 02:00:50,250
when there's money on the table,
they go, who's this guy? When?

2223
02:00:50,251 --> 02:00:54,430
When is Joey Diaz Get up there? You know,
and then they find out that Joey Diaz,

2224
02:00:54,820 --> 02:00:56,650
I ain't got a lot of your
dog and Never Las Vegas.

2225
02:00:57,740 --> 02:00:58,573
Okay.

2226
02:00:59,190 --> 02:01:01,080
What are the influence?
He did it a bunch of times,

2227
02:01:01,081 --> 02:01:04,290
but this is back in the dark
days. Joe, he's very reliable now.

2228
02:01:04,291 --> 02:01:05,970
Scares the shit out of me man.
Awesome.

2229
02:01:06,140 --> 02:01:07,640
Like I love him but he scares the shit.

2230
02:01:07,641 --> 02:01:10,820
I mean I did shows in Tucson with him
and it was so afraid to talk to him.

2231
02:01:10,821 --> 02:01:13,280
Why I did it was a great guy.

2232
02:01:13,300 --> 02:01:17,420
Well cause he's just like rough and he's
not like bad aggressive, but he's just,

2233
02:01:18,380 --> 02:01:20,300
he gets mad at me for,
he'll get mad at me.

2234
02:01:20,301 --> 02:01:22,800
It was the last thing we got mad
at me for Susko Hannah. We'd, yeah,

2235
02:01:23,210 --> 02:01:24,490
he didn't like my weed.

2236
02:01:24,500 --> 02:01:28,190
We fucked up and we w someone told me
you should grind your weed in a coffee

2237
02:01:28,191 --> 02:01:32,510
grinder. And I'm like, oh that seems like
it would make sense. You just be like,

2238
02:01:32,511 --> 02:01:34,520
it'd be really quick.
Right. But when you do that,

2239
02:01:34,521 --> 02:01:38,720
it makes it way too fine and it pack
these joints so thick you literally

2240
02:01:38,721 --> 02:01:43,290
couldn't through them. Oh,
hi. It was like, we figured
it out. We figured it out.

2241
02:01:43,291 --> 02:01:45,620
After a while you have to use like a
regular grind or you can't use a coffee

2242
02:01:45,621 --> 02:01:46,610
grinder.
It's just too much.

2243
02:01:46,820 --> 02:01:49,640
So we did it with Joey and he got so
mad he was swinging and you just give me

2244
02:01:49,641 --> 02:01:52,280
this fucking Susko Hannah,
we'd Susko Hannah.

2245
02:01:52,280 --> 02:01:55,770
We thought he was talking about Hannah
Montana and it turns out the Susko Hannah.

2246
02:01:55,990 --> 02:02:00,260
Cause that's what he'll say, you know,
like he wouldn't call you Josh McDermitt.

2247
02:02:00,350 --> 02:02:04,250
He would call you a fucking,
I like that guy like Josh McDougall.

2248
02:02:04,251 --> 02:02:07,700
He's fucking hilarious.
And he will come up with just a subtle,

2249
02:02:07,760 --> 02:02:11,750
and I think he does it a little
bit on purpose. Subtle fuck up.

2250
02:02:11,751 --> 02:02:15,530
And the way he still calls Nick
Swanson. Yeah, Nick's and Nick Swardson,

2251
02:02:15,531 --> 02:02:19,160
he calls Nick Swanson. You know,
he was listening. Brian Redman,

2252
02:02:19,370 --> 02:02:23,660
I'm tired of your bullshit.
Yeah, he's uh, he's, but,

2253
02:02:23,690 --> 02:02:27,890
but he's a great guy. He's a national
treasure to me guys like that.

2254
02:02:27,920 --> 02:02:30,410
It's just like, how do you, how do
you create a guy like that? You could,

2255
02:02:30,620 --> 02:02:35,480
you could throw a million people through
life and you will never get a Joey Diaz

2256
02:02:35,500 --> 02:02:39,380
and so rare combination of events that
have to take place to get a guy that's

2257
02:02:39,381 --> 02:02:41,990
just that comical and doesn't
give a fuck and just that's it.

2258
02:02:42,230 --> 02:02:46,910
That's our original human. So hard for
someone to really truly be themselves.

2259
02:02:46,911 --> 02:02:48,950
It's a very difficult thing
that we have in this life.

2260
02:02:48,951 --> 02:02:53,951
This want for self acceptance and sex
and money and poor Brian can't get on

2261
02:02:54,351 --> 02:02:57,320
Wikipedia round.
He gets upset about that.

2262
02:02:57,321 --> 02:03:01,580
There's very few people in this world
learn how to just not give a fuck,

2263
02:03:01,810 --> 02:03:05,930
not give a fuck. And Joey,
Joey, just Diaz is, listen dog.

2264
02:03:05,931 --> 02:03:09,950
If I'm on Wikipedia, I'm on Wikipedia.
Whatever dog. I don't give a fuck.

2265
02:03:09,951 --> 02:03:11,960
Give a fuck. I ain't got time
for that. You know what I'm on.

2266
02:03:12,020 --> 02:03:16,620
I'm on Joey Coco diaz.com go
hit me up on Facebook, Twitter.

2267
02:03:16,760 --> 02:03:21,020
Check yourself before you wreck yourself.
Big Dixon Yas is bad for your health.

2268
02:03:22,240 --> 02:03:24,800
Are you going to any Halloween parties
this year that you have to dress up for?

2269
02:03:24,860 --> 02:03:25,280
Yes.

2270
02:03:25,280 --> 02:03:28,910
And unfortunately I took my three and a
half year old to the Halloween stores.

2271
02:03:28,910 --> 02:03:31,400
Her, her idea like, Daddy,
we have to get you a costume.

2272
02:03:31,410 --> 02:03:33,980
We have to get you a costume. All
right, let's do it. Let's do it.

2273
02:03:34,040 --> 02:03:37,940
So she picked out this really
fucking scary mask. I would
go get it for you guys,

2274
02:03:37,941 --> 02:03:41,180
but it's upstairs. It's really
scary. Zombie masks. I'm like, oh,

2275
02:03:41,181 --> 02:03:44,510
I want to be a Zombie. But
uh, I showed it to the,

2276
02:03:44,540 --> 02:03:47,120
to the one year old and the one year
olds just started shaking her head,

2277
02:03:48,710 --> 02:03:51,380
thrown that away. I can't wear
it. And so then I said, well,

2278
02:03:51,381 --> 02:03:54,170
I'll just play with it with the three and
a half year old. But when I put it on,

2279
02:03:54,200 --> 02:03:57,440
take it off, Daddy, take it
off. Like I had to take it
off. I'm like, I'm just okay.

2280
02:03:57,441 --> 02:04:00,740
I'm taking it off and is okay. You put it
on again. I put it on and it's just, no,

2281
02:04:00,741 --> 02:04:05,510
no, no, take it off. Take it off. It's too
scary. It's too scary. So, so I fucked.

2282
02:04:05,511 --> 02:04:09,200
That was my mom dude. She would, she
would, she's like the female Andy Kaufman.

2283
02:04:09,201 --> 02:04:10,160
Right.
She would put the,

2284
02:04:10,161 --> 02:04:13,580
she would put these like ugly hideous
masks on and it looked like you'd dumped

2285
02:04:13,850 --> 02:04:16,950
acid on their face and everything
your mom would do that you had do.

2286
02:04:16,951 --> 02:04:18,260
My mom was fucking crazy.
Right.

2287
02:04:18,470 --> 02:04:21,260
So we'd come home from school and
she'd be sitting on the porch.

2288
02:04:21,261 --> 02:04:24,330
I get wrapped up in a blanket and
a hat with that mask on and she's,

2289
02:04:24,440 --> 02:04:28,310
and we'd be like, hey mom. She
was like, we were eight years old,

2290
02:04:28,311 --> 02:04:30,410
just scaring the shit out of us.
That's awesome.

2291
02:04:30,440 --> 02:04:34,130
Why did your mom want to scare
you so bad? I, I don't know, man.

2292
02:04:34,160 --> 02:04:38,040
She wanted to be like, oh, she wanted to
be a comic, but she just never really did

2293
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:41,910
anything about it, you know? Wow. Like
she's a dude. She's the funniest person.

2294
02:04:41,911 --> 02:04:46,500
I know, isn't it? Uh, this, uh, uh,
for us, for someone who's done comedy,

2295
02:04:46,710 --> 02:04:48,030
isn't it a sad,

2296
02:04:48,031 --> 02:04:50,730
sad thing when you meet someone who
really should be a comic and they're not

2297
02:04:50,731 --> 02:04:54,510
doing it? Yeah. All met them.
Right, right, right. No, absolutely.

2298
02:04:54,540 --> 02:04:57,750
Some of the funniest people I know
are not comedians not tied to the

2299
02:04:57,751 --> 02:05:01,710
entertainment industry at all. Yeah,
I've met some hilarious regular people.

2300
02:05:01,860 --> 02:05:03,900
Hilarious.
My mom would do some crazy,

2301
02:05:03,901 --> 02:05:07,410
crazy dark shit like when she was like
nine months pregnant with my little

2302
02:05:07,411 --> 02:05:12,000
brother and I'm like four
or five years old. And she
says, um, I did something bad.

2303
02:05:12,001 --> 02:05:14,610
And she's like, come into the kitchen,
you're getting punished. I go,

2304
02:05:14,611 --> 02:05:17,720
go into the kitchen. She sits
down on a stool and she goes,
listen, you know, do we,

2305
02:05:17,730 --> 02:05:20,740
what do you want me to punish you?
I'm like, I dunno. I Dunno. She goes,

2306
02:05:20,770 --> 02:05:24,450
I'm going to kill your little brother.
Like she tells me this five years old,

2307
02:05:24,990 --> 02:05:28,170
she sat on a stool, lifted her
stomach, had a retractable knife,

2308
02:05:28,171 --> 02:05:30,670
which I didn't know is we're
tracking to get into her stomach.

2309
02:05:32,600 --> 02:05:36,870
Oh my God, my God. Oh
my God. You know. Wow.

2310
02:05:37,260 --> 02:05:42,080
That was the childhood I grew up, dude.
What's that type of shit? That's crazy.

2311
02:05:42,081 --> 02:05:44,480
So then of course, you know, she pulled
up, she goes, this is a retractable knife.

2312
02:05:44,481 --> 02:05:47,840
And knowing my mom, she would do that
shit all the time, but I'd be like, oh,

2313
02:05:47,841 --> 02:05:51,140
that's hilarious.
Like the mother version of those cops,

2314
02:05:51,141 --> 02:05:52,670
it made those kids sit in the corner.

2315
02:05:53,450 --> 02:05:55,910
That's like the mother version
that your mother is a criminal.

2316
02:05:55,940 --> 02:06:00,540
It sounds like growing up in
the Family Guy House. Yeah.

2317
02:06:00,710 --> 02:06:04,510
That sounded like so cartoonish. Is
your mom still around? Yeah. Yeah.

2318
02:06:04,511 --> 02:06:06,710
And she's still crazy as fuck.
Do you want to get revenge?

2319
02:06:06,711 --> 02:06:08,780
We could do something really cool.
Well don't listen to him.

2320
02:06:08,781 --> 02:06:11,240
He'll get you locked up in jail. Yeah.
I don't find career ahead of you.

2321
02:06:11,241 --> 02:06:14,910
You're an excellent standup comic. Thank
you. Spray. It's called liquid ass.

2322
02:06:15,560 --> 02:06:18,830
Don't do I love my mom. I next thing you
know, someone's dead hanging from a tree.

2323
02:06:18,831 --> 02:06:21,540
That's how it goes. They don't resent
her for any of this stuff, you know,

2324
02:06:21,570 --> 02:06:25,010
made you probably funny. It's one of
the reasons why you are so irreverent.

2325
02:06:25,040 --> 02:06:27,660
You know, you have such a funny
sense of humor maybe. Yeah, no,

2326
02:06:27,680 --> 02:06:32,240
that's absolutely what it was. Yeah. But
she uh, I mean, but now that, you know,

2327
02:06:32,241 --> 02:06:35,000
there's the sh she had six
kids and then you know,

2328
02:06:35,001 --> 02:06:37,460
everybody's got grandkids and everything
so she starts to fuck with the

2329
02:06:37,461 --> 02:06:42,130
grandkids a little bit. Hairy woman
has to be stopped. I'm like God,

2330
02:06:42,410 --> 02:06:42,591
you know,

2331
02:06:42,591 --> 02:06:46,010
my brothers and sisters and we're all
kind of onto her so we're a little more

2332
02:06:46,011 --> 02:06:50,380
protective. So like what my sister
had a kid like in, in, I dunno,

2333
02:06:50,390 --> 02:06:53,570
he was like eight months old or whatever
he was on in the back in her bedroom

2334
02:06:53,571 --> 02:06:56,600
like with pillows around them on the
bed so he wouldn't roll off or whatever.

2335
02:06:57,050 --> 02:07:01,660
And we were just sitting around and my
sister in law goes, where's Judy? And,

2336
02:07:01,720 --> 02:07:04,640
and you hear her from the bedroom?
She goes, I'm not doing anything,

2337
02:07:05,060 --> 02:07:08,150
which is scary shit cause my
mom's like always doing something.

2338
02:07:08,151 --> 02:07:11,210
And we went back there and she was just
sitting on the bed with the baby and we

2339
02:07:11,240 --> 02:07:14,030
don't know what the fuck was going on,
what,

2340
02:07:14,150 --> 02:07:15,860
we don't think she was doing anything.

2341
02:07:15,890 --> 02:07:19,520
But you still don't know with her because
she was always worried about what do

2342
02:07:19,521 --> 02:07:23,900
you think she would do? I don't know.
I mean it was never like dangerous.

2343
02:07:23,930 --> 02:07:28,670
It was never dangerous. It was never
like, she's really crazy, a fun, crazy,

2344
02:07:28,671 --> 02:07:31,040
not like crazy like you,
we're not going to let you,

2345
02:07:31,250 --> 02:07:33,230
would it be around the kids but you,

2346
02:07:33,231 --> 02:07:35,500
you were worried that she was
in there alone with the baby?

2347
02:07:36,220 --> 02:07:38,650
Well, yeah. Well I think it was more
like what will, where is she? Why?

2348
02:07:38,651 --> 02:07:41,800
Why are we all at her house and sitting
in her living room and she's not here

2349
02:07:42,300 --> 02:07:45,820
doing it. I'm not doing anything which
may have just been to fuck with us.

2350
02:07:45,850 --> 02:07:49,600
Like she would do that too. I
get it. It's not bad. Crazy.

2351
02:07:50,540 --> 02:07:54,820
Trump obviously stabbing your stomach for
your five year old was probably a poor

2352
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:58,960
choice and judgment, but I knew my mom
well enough at that point that I was like,

2353
02:07:58,990 --> 02:08:03,040
oh she's, she's just kidding around.
And once she told me, that's so crazy.

2354
02:08:03,130 --> 02:08:04,210
I would come home from school,

2355
02:08:04,211 --> 02:08:08,440
I'd come home from school and she'd like
pops a blood capsules and lay on the

2356
02:08:08,441 --> 02:08:11,480
sidewalk or in the middle of the
way and I'd come home. But it,

2357
02:08:11,530 --> 02:08:13,210
we just step over and be like,
get up mom.

2358
02:08:13,210 --> 02:08:17,560
Like she's trying to get us way
that she passed out or something.

2359
02:08:17,620 --> 02:08:19,990
Oh my God.
But what if she actually did it's again,

2360
02:08:19,991 --> 02:08:21,810
it's just like that fucking shitty share.

2361
02:08:23,710 --> 02:08:28,510
Your mom cried wolf every day.
Every day. Holy Shit, US man. Wow.

2362
02:08:28,540 --> 02:08:31,420
But look, look at this sense of humor
you got out of it. Oh, she loves it.

2363
02:08:31,421 --> 02:08:35,440
She's milking it to with their friends.
And that you're a comic. The comic. Yeah.

2364
02:08:35,441 --> 02:08:37,300
I told you I was funny.
I got funny jeans.

2365
02:08:37,600 --> 02:08:40,840
It's all over Facebook or was she just
knocked it off like she's all over

2366
02:08:40,841 --> 02:08:45,370
Facebook. Yeah, it's, it's upsetting me.

2367
02:08:46,480 --> 02:08:50,770
The last time I saw a mom that
was into her son's career,

2368
02:08:50,771 --> 02:08:55,100
it was Stan helps mom at home. Mom was
pretty funny. She was hilarious. She,

2369
02:08:55,101 --> 02:08:59,500
she's to review porn for us on the
man show stand helps moms. Hilarious.

2370
02:09:00,030 --> 02:09:04,340
She was a character man. Really
fucking funny lady. Well, my,

2371
02:09:04,390 --> 02:09:07,990
my mom's the type of woman that if I
ever wanted her to do bits and everything

2372
02:09:07,991 --> 02:09:10,780
she would, but of course, you know,

2373
02:09:12,880 --> 02:09:15,730
fucked with us a lot, man.
I mean, I've got stories,

2374
02:09:15,731 --> 02:09:18,970
just tons of stupid shit that she would
do. That's how you become a comic,

2375
02:09:18,971 --> 02:09:21,880
I guess though, right? I mean, I don't
think you'd become a comic. Well,

2376
02:09:22,030 --> 02:09:26,140
it can't say, you'd never know.
We really, there's no clear path.

2377
02:09:26,170 --> 02:09:29,980
It could be just someone has a sense of
humor and regardless of how nice their

2378
02:09:29,981 --> 02:09:31,350
family was or they grew up,
I,

2379
02:09:31,351 --> 02:09:34,840
I've had guys with seemingly perfect
lives who become comics and they're funny,

2380
02:09:35,380 --> 02:09:39,010
but it's what if your child had an
upbringing? He was a little fucked up.

2381
02:09:39,011 --> 02:09:41,230
That's a mind for mine.
Gold Mine.

2382
02:09:41,260 --> 02:09:44,410
I haven't really talked about my mom
on stage much just because I don't,

2383
02:09:44,440 --> 02:09:47,800
I don't want to blow it too early
because you don't like the longer you do

2384
02:09:47,801 --> 02:09:49,210
comedy that funny you,

2385
02:09:49,270 --> 02:09:52,900
you become and you kind of understand
your point of view a little bit more.

2386
02:09:53,170 --> 02:09:56,520
I know that there's such great shit there.
I don't want to blow it early,

2387
02:09:56,521 --> 02:09:57,910
which you just told us on stage.

2388
02:09:58,030 --> 02:10:01,270
You don't think that could be hilarious
on a show or telling what you just told

2389
02:10:01,271 --> 02:10:02,540
us on stage.
The knife.

2390
02:10:02,680 --> 02:10:05,380
If you were talking about that on stage
a little bit and people didn't laugh.

2391
02:10:05,381 --> 02:10:08,700
So at that may have scared me away too.
It's like, I know this is great, but dude,

2392
02:10:08,820 --> 02:10:11,530
it's hilarious. Problem
is people are like, whoa.

2393
02:10:11,710 --> 02:10:13,630
More horrified then find this funny.

2394
02:10:13,890 --> 02:10:15,850
But just your sense of
humor is a little warped.

2395
02:10:15,851 --> 02:10:18,760
The you found it hilarious and then
you went, well that's fucked up.

2396
02:10:18,790 --> 02:10:20,380
You just have to relieve them of that.

2397
02:10:20,381 --> 02:10:23,860
You have to somehow or another relieve
them of that ad like right catch up

2398
02:10:23,861 --> 02:10:27,220
instead of gliding down fries
into it. Okay. Mother fucker.

2399
02:10:27,221 --> 02:10:31,960
As many of you listening, it's
just silly, silly, silly boy.

2400
02:10:32,870 --> 02:10:34,220
Um,
so if anybody wants to find

2401
02:10:34,220 --> 02:10:34,910
Josh,

2402
02:10:34,910 --> 02:10:39,910
Josh has a fine standup comics travels
all over the place and you TV show is

2403
02:10:40,671 --> 02:10:43,460
retired at 35.
We just got an air date.

2404
02:10:43,520 --> 02:10:47,960
Our second season starts in March 2nd.
What network is it on?

2405
02:10:48,290 --> 02:10:53,150
TV Land. It's a small cable network on
by MTV. That's cool. And the vet channel,

2406
02:10:53,680 --> 02:10:55,210
when I go to sleep to they,
they,

2407
02:10:55,220 --> 02:10:59,210
they do reruns of everybody loves
Raymond and Lucy. Lucy. Yeah.

2408
02:10:59,510 --> 02:11:02,750
Cosby show all that old Lucy you were,

2409
02:11:02,780 --> 02:11:07,490
you were a radio DJ for awhile.
Where at? In Phoenix and Phoenix,

2410
02:11:07,491 --> 02:11:09,170
Arizona. I would tell you
how to do, we got time.

2411
02:11:09,171 --> 02:11:13,550
Did I ever tell you how I started with
that? No. So I was like 14 years old.

2412
02:11:13,870 --> 02:11:16,100
Do you, do you remember the
Tim and Willie Show in Phoenix?

2413
02:11:16,101 --> 02:11:18,890
Do you remember radio shows at
all? Yes, Brian Remembers. Let me,

2414
02:11:18,891 --> 02:11:21,770
so that was the show. I worked him and
Willie, Tim and Willie's country music.

2415
02:11:21,800 --> 02:11:24,810
Okay. So anyway, we did their show.
I did a lot of different, yeah,

2416
02:11:24,811 --> 02:11:29,660
you would do are you did our show a lot,
but um, I did. Every time I did with you,

2417
02:11:31,220 --> 02:11:34,910
I was a producer, we would go to every
time we go. Right, right. And Tim,

2418
02:11:34,911 --> 02:11:39,230
we ran into Tim at the mall
one day wandering around.
Yes. Super cool guys. Yeah,

2419
02:11:39,231 --> 02:11:43,390
they're great. Yeah. So I
was like 14 years old and uh,

2420
02:11:43,400 --> 02:11:45,980
it was right when that Song
Achy breaky heart was like,

2421
02:11:46,010 --> 02:11:48,080
was out and people were starting
to make fun of it. You know,

2422
02:11:48,081 --> 02:11:51,660
the Billy Ray Cyrus Song, you
don't tell her keep brick. Yeah.

2423
02:11:52,150 --> 02:11:55,910
So I would listen to their show cause I
thought they just had a funny radio show,

2424
02:11:55,911 --> 02:11:58,190
but not necessarily because of the
country music. I could give a shit.

2425
02:11:58,580 --> 02:12:02,690
So one day I called up and I'm 14 years
old and I requested Achy breaky heart,

2426
02:12:02,691 --> 02:12:05,660
but I did a funny voice that
said, hello, my name is Coco.

2427
02:12:05,660 --> 02:12:09,260
Can you play a key breaky heart? And
they're like, what the fuck is your name?

2428
02:12:09,261 --> 02:12:11,600
And I said, well, it's Kako. And they
started asking me about it. Well,

2429
02:12:11,601 --> 02:12:15,090
I hadn't thought of like a
backstory and all that stuff.

2430
02:12:15,450 --> 02:12:19,730
So I'm like making it up on the fly.
Mcglynn Pilipino and it just,

2431
02:12:19,890 --> 02:12:23,820
I just moved to America. I love a
cubic yard. I'll sing it for us.

2432
02:12:24,060 --> 02:12:27,810
I started singing it for him and like,
uh, they loved it. They're like, hey,

2433
02:12:27,811 --> 02:12:32,780
call us back anytime. Kako is great. So
I'd call back every fucking day, you know,

2434
02:12:33,060 --> 02:12:36,840
and I'm calling and, and I became this
like mini celebrity on their show is Kaka,

2435
02:12:36,841 --> 02:12:39,750
which they didn't know was a,
a fake guy.

2436
02:12:40,110 --> 02:12:43,920
One of the story I told Hako in in the
split second where I was coming up with

2437
02:12:43,921 --> 02:12:44,880
this backstory,

2438
02:12:45,030 --> 02:12:49,380
I said I was born in England and my and
moved to the Philippines when I was two

2439
02:12:49,381 --> 02:12:53,460
years old because my father was in the
Royal Air Force that way I thought if I

2440
02:12:53,461 --> 02:12:54,870
ever meet them,
that will be,

2441
02:12:54,871 --> 02:12:57,030
that will be the justification
is why I'm a white guy.

2442
02:12:58,680 --> 02:13:02,590
So you were going to show up a white
guy with a Filipino accent. Oh my God,

2443
02:13:02,591 --> 02:13:03,860
it's brilliant.
So they go.

2444
02:13:04,400 --> 02:13:08,640
So they were like cargo call us anytime
and they would play the fucking phone

2445
02:13:08,641 --> 02:13:11,670
calls. Then I started calling up as
a guy named Josh and I'm like, dude,

2446
02:13:11,671 --> 02:13:15,300
I'm Kokkos biggest fan play
his phone call from yesterday.

2447
02:13:15,480 --> 02:13:18,680
So it's like marketing myself and
everything. They're like genius.

2448
02:13:18,710 --> 02:13:21,810
So they would do these little concerts
and like a Garth Brooks would come into

2449
02:13:21,811 --> 02:13:24,810
town and they would introduce Garth
Brooks on stage and they would invite some

2450
02:13:24,811 --> 02:13:26,550
of the players from the radio
show out. And then, you know,

2451
02:13:26,551 --> 02:13:31,020
Kako was like this big star and he
would come out there. And um, in fact,

2452
02:13:31,040 --> 02:13:34,030
the first time I met them I walked into
the studio and they just looked at me

2453
02:13:34,040 --> 02:13:36,210
and they're like, what the
fuck? And they're like, okay,

2454
02:13:36,211 --> 02:13:41,100
you can drop the accent now. And I'm like,
what are you talking about? [inaudible]

2455
02:13:41,100 --> 02:13:44,770
character dude really
never broke character. And,

2456
02:13:44,790 --> 02:13:47,610
and this whole bit came about
how I was looking for a job.

2457
02:13:47,640 --> 02:13:51,630
I was in high school and they're trying
to find me a job and then they would

2458
02:13:51,631 --> 02:13:52,411
find me these jobs,

2459
02:13:52,411 --> 02:13:54,600
but I couldn't go to the job because
it was a fucking in high school.

2460
02:13:55,350 --> 02:13:58,170
And they're like, hey, you know,
so they called me Taco. Yeah.

2461
02:13:58,171 --> 02:14:02,320
You never showed up for your
[inaudible] slipped in, you know,

2462
02:14:03,700 --> 02:14:04,280
Larry.

2463
02:14:04,280 --> 02:14:07,800
So I had like 10 different characters
going on in the show and they didn't know

2464
02:14:07,801 --> 02:14:10,530
it was all from one guy. And then
they said at one point they were like,

2465
02:14:10,531 --> 02:14:13,330
Kako you should work down
here, man. And I got sick.

2466
02:14:13,380 --> 02:14:17,040
That's when I got scared and I was
like, oh, this is my real voice.

2467
02:14:17,080 --> 02:14:20,790
[inaudible]
and their jaws dropped.

2468
02:14:20,791 --> 02:14:23,280
I thought it was going to get arrested
or something. And they're like, no.

2469
02:14:23,340 --> 02:14:26,430
They're like, dude, you have to
work down here. Oh, that's the list.

2470
02:14:26,550 --> 02:14:30,630
That's how I got the job with them.
And so from, Gosh, what was that,

2471
02:14:30,640 --> 02:14:34,800
90 93 until 2007 I worked for them.

2472
02:14:34,860 --> 02:14:38,850
Whoa, that's amazing. We
were syndicated for a while.

2473
02:14:38,851 --> 02:14:41,850
14 years.
Holy Shit.

2474
02:14:43,050 --> 02:14:44,370
We were syndicated for awhile.

2475
02:14:44,430 --> 02:14:48,760
I was the producer for that and I would
travel the country when I came in and do

2476
02:14:48,761 --> 02:14:48,821
it,

2477
02:14:48,821 --> 02:14:52,290
cause I never really remember sitting
down and talking to you until I saw you on

2478
02:14:52,291 --> 02:14:55,110
stage. Yeah, we met, I
met you before. That was,

2479
02:14:55,111 --> 02:14:57,420
it was just like a high walking
through the hallway. She was like, Hey,

2480
02:14:57,421 --> 02:14:59,970
can I get you some water?
We're going on the air in 10 minutes.

2481
02:15:00,320 --> 02:15:01,153
Some of that bull shit.

2482
02:15:01,400 --> 02:15:05,820
Probably remember this because I must've
remembered it when I first saw you do

2483
02:15:05,821 --> 02:15:08,820
stand up because I'm,
I'm remembering it now.

2484
02:15:08,820 --> 02:15:11,430
Like a glimmer of it and I think
you would ask someone from the club,

2485
02:15:11,431 --> 02:15:15,060
you were like, Hey, who was that that you
know, blonde fat kid with the glasses.

2486
02:15:15,061 --> 02:15:18,240
Who, who, you know who was funny last
night, I want him to open for me.

2487
02:15:18,241 --> 02:15:18,451
They're like,

2488
02:15:18,451 --> 02:15:21,690
oh we'll see him tomorrow morning and
you probably came in and did our show and

2489
02:15:21,691 --> 02:15:25,290
then you said hey do you want to, it
was something like that might have been,

2490
02:15:25,291 --> 02:15:29,340
it might have been that. Yeah, but
I was so long ago. Yeah, it's crazy.

2491
02:15:29,341 --> 02:15:32,340
Time flies man. We would have
all the comics on and I mean I,

2492
02:15:32,350 --> 02:15:34,530
I've met so many people and no one,

2493
02:15:34,531 --> 02:15:37,320
I don't ever expect anyone to remember
who the fuck I was but I must have been a

2494
02:15:37,321 --> 02:15:38,430
cool job.
You know,

2495
02:15:38,431 --> 02:15:43,431
like it was great doing standup and
well it started a sock and that's why I

2496
02:15:43,651 --> 02:15:47,450
started doing stand up cause we got bought
out by clear channel bump, bump bump.

2497
02:15:47,450 --> 02:15:52,050
No there it is. And it, that
just made me what happened.

2498
02:15:52,120 --> 02:15:56,190
It's they suck the fun out of it
man. What they do? Uh, they just,

2499
02:15:56,191 --> 02:16:00,780
all the budget cuts, all, you know,
like my mind just works in being funny.

2500
02:16:00,990 --> 02:16:02,910
I just want to be funny.
And then they were just like,

2501
02:16:03,060 --> 02:16:06,180
well we need you to start figuring
out ways we can sell advertising time.

2502
02:16:06,181 --> 02:16:08,670
And I'm like, I'm a fucking writer
and a producer. I'm not, you know,

2503
02:16:08,671 --> 02:16:12,990
talk to the salespeople and just,
they, it just made the show not fun.

2504
02:16:12,991 --> 02:16:16,740
We started out, you were, they
wanted you to find, it was like,

2505
02:16:16,741 --> 02:16:20,700
well what kind of bits can we do that we
can sell to an advertiser to this tire

2506
02:16:20,701 --> 02:16:24,870
company. So this tire company, we've
got this advertiser and they want,

2507
02:16:24,871 --> 02:16:27,840
they want to buy airtime with us but they
only want to do it on the morning show.

2508
02:16:27,960 --> 02:16:29,980
And they're like,
so can you figure out like a funny bit

2509
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:33,970
we can incorporate tires into?
I'm like, no, what the fuck?

2510
02:16:34,240 --> 02:16:37,030
It's like weird shit like that.
And I'm just like, this is not fun.

2511
02:16:37,060 --> 02:16:39,010
That's a dumb way to approach it.
Or they should say,

2512
02:16:39,011 --> 02:16:41,770
just make it the funniest thing
possible and we'll sell regular ads.

2513
02:16:41,771 --> 02:16:45,310
Go our rating nutty.
Our radio station was owned by Buck Owens.

2514
02:16:45,311 --> 02:16:48,580
You know who buck Owens and
country star. Yeah, legendary dude.

2515
02:16:48,820 --> 02:16:51,430
And he owned like two or three radio
stations and we were one of them.

2516
02:16:51,431 --> 02:16:56,200
So we were like the focus of that
company when clear channel came in,

2517
02:16:56,201 --> 02:16:59,740
they got hundreds of stations that
could give a shit about us and it just

2518
02:16:59,741 --> 02:17:00,461
stopped being fun.

2519
02:17:00,461 --> 02:17:03,220
So I had a buddy who started
doing stand up and I went and did,

2520
02:17:03,450 --> 02:17:06,100
I was writing jokes for him and then
I'm like, oh, I'll give this a shot.

2521
02:17:06,790 --> 02:17:10,570
And it was more of an outlet
for me because I'd have to
censor myself on the air.

2522
02:17:10,870 --> 02:17:12,370
They got this guy,
I don't remember his name,

2523
02:17:12,371 --> 02:17:15,100
but he was like the CEO or something.
And he was always like,

2524
02:17:15,250 --> 02:17:18,790
I think it was like listening
to like a 50 cent song and uh,

2525
02:17:18,840 --> 02:17:21,610
and his daughter was in the car and he
like had to turn it down. He's like,

2526
02:17:21,611 --> 02:17:23,880
we got it. We're censoring
everything and we're, you know,

2527
02:17:24,250 --> 02:17:27,070
clear channel really started
putting their thumb on everything.

2528
02:17:27,071 --> 02:17:31,900
It was so much shit was confetti. It
says all that stuff. And so white girls,

2529
02:17:32,260 --> 02:17:36,040
Jackson, 50 cent, black girls,
just a big mess. You shouldn't you,

2530
02:17:36,041 --> 02:17:40,300
do you need a podcast hunting or said Oh,
100%. And what are you gonna do for me,

2531
02:17:40,301 --> 02:17:43,210
man, I'll get you that Wikipedia
page. Well listen man, you,

2532
02:17:43,650 --> 02:17:47,020
if you sign up on the desk squad and
be a part of his podcast network,

2533
02:17:47,170 --> 02:17:51,070
they right now are number seven.
There's a number seven all yes.

2534
02:17:51,100 --> 02:17:55,000
Right now he's in the top 10.
We great man.

2535
02:17:55,060 --> 02:17:58,180
Well we started doing this thing
live at the Ice House and uh,

2536
02:17:58,181 --> 02:18:03,181
we aired one half of it on mine and one
half of it on his and when we put one

2537
02:18:03,611 --> 02:18:06,220
half and I, his, his shit jumped
all the way. Oh, number six.

2538
02:18:06,221 --> 02:18:10,240
He's number six right now.
So by doing his podcast,

2539
02:18:10,420 --> 02:18:14,410
automatically you're going to get seen
or listened to by hundreds of thousands

2540
02:18:14,411 --> 02:18:19,240
of people that you wouldn't normally do.
So we'll just do it on his and dude,

2541
02:18:19,241 --> 02:18:23,320
you, you're perfect for this. You've got
great stories. You're a fucking smart guy.

2542
02:18:23,620 --> 02:18:26,950
It'll help your stand up.
It's easy as fuck to do.

2543
02:18:27,570 --> 02:18:30,130
And you could probably set it up where
you could do it from your own fucking

2544
02:18:30,131 --> 02:18:33,040
house and just getting
ready to file. Not Hard. No,

2545
02:18:34,310 --> 02:18:37,330
you got to come over to my house now.
Now you have to come to my house.

2546
02:18:37,660 --> 02:18:39,970
Why am I going to come over to the
house, Dude, I'm on a TV show, man.

2547
02:18:39,971 --> 02:18:40,930
I don't have to go to your house.

2548
02:18:43,420 --> 02:18:46,960
I think it's your own show too right now.
Well, I mean that's what I tell people.

2549
02:18:46,980 --> 02:18:51,190
No, I'm not. Who's The star?
George Segal. Oh, the old
dude. Yeah. From just shoot me.

2550
02:18:51,280 --> 02:18:54,190
Oh, that guy's a great act. Jessica
Walter, the old man, the old man,

2551
02:18:54,191 --> 02:18:57,010
the old woman from some recipe
development doing something with like her.

2552
02:18:57,020 --> 02:18:59,050
She's cute.
Maybe it was you.

2553
02:18:59,051 --> 02:19:01,750
And they were talking about him
doing something that George Segal,

2554
02:19:01,840 --> 02:19:04,750
I think we talked about this Friday night
at the ice house. Was that what it was?

2555
02:19:04,810 --> 02:19:08,560
Oh, that's what it was and we talked about
it on the actual live at the icehouse

2556
02:19:08,590 --> 02:19:12,610
podcast. Yeah, so that one, that one live
dice house podcast. That's what did it.

2557
02:19:12,820 --> 02:19:17,710
So in with us son, Collin dilutes
getting juicy comic needs this man.

2558
02:19:17,740 --> 02:19:19,190
Every comic is this.

2559
02:19:19,420 --> 02:19:23,020
It's like having your own radio station
with no fucking clear channel. Not One.

2560
02:19:23,160 --> 02:19:26,830
If it can't just step in and tell you
there's no way I'd be able to say cut this

2561
02:19:26,831 --> 02:19:27,920
much on a radio station

2562
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:32,480
many times is that you see black con?
I tallied it only because it's habit.

2563
02:19:32,660 --> 02:19:34,820
I've tallied how many
you've set up 14 times,

2564
02:19:34,821 --> 02:19:36,380
but that's all because it's had a habit.

2565
02:19:36,410 --> 02:19:39,830
Do you do it out of habit because of
radio career? He years, yeah. Wow.

2566
02:19:39,860 --> 02:19:43,460
I said court cut 1415 now. Wow. Nice.

2567
02:19:44,080 --> 02:19:48,830
Some guys going to go back and check
now. Kinds of beautiful word. The end.

2590
02:21:08,541 --> 02:21:13,290
this rubber vagina? They wouldn't be
offended. Right? Thank you for your help.

2591
02:21:14,630 --> 02:21:17,250
It's fucking shows over. All right.
We'll see you guys on Thursday.

2592
02:21:17,280 --> 02:21:21,330
Probably do a Thursday afternoon
show. We're going to do a laser. Uh,

2593

but she's coming up soon.

2594
02:21:23,990 --> 02:21:26,330
You're going to do a lot to do on
Thursday. We're doing so many on Thursday.

2595
02:21:27,560 --> 02:21:32,000
I'll tell you. We'll figure it private
and Thursday bitches. It's a three, three,

2596
02:21:32,001 --> 02:21:35,450

And this is UFC weekend too,

2597
02:21:35,451 --> 02:21:37,370

about that on Thursday too.

2598
02:21:37,371 --> 02:21:39,930
Maybe we'll get Joe Diaz
in here. Yeah. Need Joey.

02:21:43,430 --> 02:21:45,710
You might not want to walk on
ice and might as well dance.

2601
02:21:46,220 --> 02:21:48,380
That's the end of this podcast.

Ya and we'll see you soon. Bye. Bye.
