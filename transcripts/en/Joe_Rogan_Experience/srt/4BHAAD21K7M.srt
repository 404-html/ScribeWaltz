1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,650
That's literally turning,

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,230
Wash Shahada,

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,450
a beautiful voice man.

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:09,261
Sweet,

5
00:00:09,261 --> 00:00:09,501
right?

6
00:00:09,501 --> 00:00:10,334
Like an angel.

7
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:13,320
Tommy.

8
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,400
So good rod.

9
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:18,830
This episode of the Joe Rogan
experience is brought to you by ting.

10
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,590
Ting is one of our favorite sponsors.

11
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:21,981
It's a,

12
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:23,090
it's an awesome company.

13
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:28,110
I great cell phone company that works on
the sprint backbone but at gives you a

14
00:00:29,331 --> 00:00:30,980
lot of options as far as like,

15
00:00:30,981 --> 00:00:31,340
um,

16
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,290
what you can do with your,

17
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:33,470
uh,

18
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:34,303
your account.

19
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:35,060
Um,

20
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,260
they don't have any contracts.

21
00:00:36,261 --> 00:00:37,880
You can cancel at any time.

22
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:38,600
Um,

23
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,411
I love this part.

24
00:00:39,411 --> 00:00:41,690
No overage charges or penalties.

25
00:00:41,691 --> 00:00:42,524
If you lose,

26
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,170
you used more time than
you thought you would.

27
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,130
You just pay for what you used
and credit on unused service.

28
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,960
This is unheard of.

29
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,050
If you use less than
you thought you would,

30
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:58,490
10 drops you down to the level you hit
and the credits that difference on your

31
00:00:58,491 --> 00:00:59,000
next bill.

32
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,211
I mean,

33
00:00:59,211 --> 00:01:00,440
that's fucking incredible.

34
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,460
That has way too fair.

35
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:02,240
It's beautiful.

36
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,020
Nobody does that.

37
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:03,853
It's such a thing.

38
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:06,530
It's a really cool idea.

39
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,060
It's like do business,

40
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,330
but do it ethically and do it in a
way where people aren't being fucked.

41
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,760
It still going to get plenty of business.

42
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,490
There's 300 million goddamn
people in this country.

43
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,600
How many people do you need?

44
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:17,850
Oh,

45
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:18,480
I know.

46
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,010
I mean,

47
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:19,610
how much,

48
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:20,670
how much money do you need?

49
00:01:20,671 --> 00:01:22,940
You wouldn't you feel happier if you had,

50
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,780
you know,

51
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:24,310
whatever,

52
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:24,590
uh,

53
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,220
enough.

54
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:25,790
But it's,

55
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:26,541
it feels good.

56
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:31,541
Like you're doing everything you should
be doing with a company providing an

57
00:01:31,941 --> 00:01:32,691
excellent service.

58
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:32,861
It's,

59
00:01:32,861 --> 00:01:34,070
it's on the sprint backbone,

60
00:01:34,071 --> 00:01:37,610
one of the biggest cell phone services
in the country and they use these awesome

61
00:01:37,611 --> 00:01:37,911
phones.

62
00:01:37,911 --> 00:01:38,570
They have these,

63
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:39,081
I was telling you,

64
00:01:39,081 --> 00:01:41,090
the Samsung Galaxy s three,

65
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,411
and they have the,

66
00:01:42,411 --> 00:01:42,531
uh,

67
00:01:42,531 --> 00:01:44,360
the note and the note to,

68
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:44,811
Oh,

69
00:01:44,811 --> 00:01:46,160
these things are insane.

70
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:46,851
Isn't it?

71
00:01:46,851 --> 00:01:47,241
Crazy?

72
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:47,950
Beautiful.

73
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:48,031
Yeah.

74
00:01:48,031 --> 00:01:48,950
It gets some notes in this.

75
00:01:48,951 --> 00:01:49,220
I know.

76
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,120
We need to get some notes.

77
00:01:50,121 --> 00:01:51,290
It makes me think the,

78
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:51,920
uh,

79
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,910
it's crazy when you hear that a company
is so ethical that it makes you go like,

80
00:01:55,911 --> 00:01:56,700
what's going on?

81
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:56,960
Yeah.

82
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,980
You guys are the CIA.

83
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,260
Why are you guys being on,

84
00:02:00,261 --> 00:02:00,560
you know,

85
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,360
why am I doing so much sneaky shit?

86
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:07,380
This is a real tendency with companies
to try to make as much money as possible

87
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:09,260
to maximize their profits,

88
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:09,981
you know,

89
00:02:09,981 --> 00:02:11,660
and the more they maximize their profits,

90
00:02:11,661 --> 00:02:14,090
especially corporations
who are dealing with many,

91
00:02:14,091 --> 00:02:17,030
many employees like who
knows how many a hundred,

92
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,571
a thousand,

93
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:18,404
whatever it is.

94
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,670
When you're dealing with all those people
and if you want to maximize profit and

95
00:02:21,671 --> 00:02:25,310
they're trying to maximize
profit collectively over a
group of like hundreds of

96
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,050
people where it makes an
impact on either one of it,

97
00:02:27,051 --> 00:02:28,370
there's a lot of fucking money involved.

98
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,203
It's what I'm trying to say.

99
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,130
And there's,

100
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,460
there's got to be the
correct ethics in place.

101
00:02:34,461 --> 00:02:36,800
And I think for a lot of
companies in this country,

102
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:37,371
they're not,

103
00:02:37,371 --> 00:02:38,750
I think a lot of companies there,

104
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,060
they're just trying to make
as much money as possible.

105
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,820
But smart people like Tang are saying,

106
00:02:43,821 --> 00:02:44,570
you know what,

107
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:49,570
you can make plenty of money and still
be really fair and that's good money.

108
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,170
That's the new concept.

109
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,850
And it's a great concept.

110
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:53,660
You know,

111
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,650
the same with hover.

112
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,401
Hover is,

113
00:02:55,401 --> 00:02:56,234
um,

114
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,150
a domain name company
that is also owned by 10.

115
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,610
And they have sort of
the same thing going on.

116
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,600
It's beautiful.

117
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,800
Go to [inaudible] dot [inaudible] dot com
and you can get 25 bucks off of either

118
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,660
one of their cell phones or service.

119
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:08,501
And then like I said,

120
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:10,770
they have top of the line android phone.

121
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:11,890
That's pretty dope malicious.

122
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,360
I used mine in Columbus,

123
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:16,750
Ohio at work to everywhere actually
worked better than my 18 t phones.

124
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:17,623
I was using my,

125
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,170
uh,

126
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:18,680
I gotta tell you to,

127
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,680
Joey loves sprint and he
says the prince amazing.

128
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:25,090
And I think sprint is
probably commensurate with
Verizon as far as the areas

129
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,700
that you can use it because it's a CDMA,

130
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:28,241
you know,

131
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,800
I think CDMA is,

132
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:30,634
um,

133
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:31,241
it's,

134
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:31,690
it's,

135
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,940
it's a different sort
of a signal than GSM.

136
00:03:33,941 --> 00:03:35,320
That's why Verizon is so good.

137
00:03:35,321 --> 00:03:39,280
One of the reasons why it doesn't drop
as much as like that CDMA can go like

138
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:40,570
deep in the buildings and shit.

139
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,351
It's a,

140
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:43,090
apparently it's older technology,

141
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,890
but it's a little bit stronger.

142
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:45,120
Just,

143
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,240
sorry to tell you one that has that one.

144
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,730
Verizon and sprint or CDMA,

145
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,250
whereas a t and t,

146
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,653
um,

147
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:53,651
t-mobile,

148
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:54,484
those are GSM.

149
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,740
So it's different kinds of stuff.

150
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:56,350
Okay.

151
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,183
Yeah.

152
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,230
But GSM is more worldwide,

153
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,280
like use GSM,

154
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:00,821
you're fine.

155
00:04:00,821 --> 00:04:01,660
And Europe,

156
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:01,950
all,

157
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,890
all throughout England.

158
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,440
If you have a Verizon phone
and you go over to England,

159
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:06,190
you're fucked.

160
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:06,550
Really?

161
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:06,851
Yeah.

162
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:08,470
You have to get a world phone.

163
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,360
It won't even work without that.

164
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:10,871
No,

165
00:04:10,871 --> 00:04:12,430
you have to get a world
phone because if you,

166
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:12,711
you're a,

167
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:14,080
you're running on a CDMA signal.

168
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:15,850
They don't use that old stupid shit.

169
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,810
Oh really?

170
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,520
It's only Americans that used that.

171
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,200
I don't understand why it's better,

172
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:25,201
but I do know that an 18 and t
you can go online as well as,

173
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:26,300
um,

174
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,700
as as make a phone call.

175
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:28,990
Like I could be talking to you.

176
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:29,670
And then I said,

177
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:29,771
well,

178
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:31,600
let me look it up real
quick and I can say,

179
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:33,460
hold on a second and while
I'm on the phone with you,

180
00:04:33,461 --> 00:04:35,260
I can go on a website or Google.

181
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,450
I can't do that with,

182
00:04:37,451 --> 00:04:37,690
uh,

183
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:38,560
with Verizon.

184
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,280
That sucks.

185
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:39,820
Yeah.

186
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,670
The only time you can do that
I think is with the four g.

187
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,353
That's a,

188
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,700
I think that the four g's.

189
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:45,911
Lao,

190
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:46,601
is that True Brian?

191
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:47,470
Or does it not yet?

192
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,251
I'm sorry.

193
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:49,810
Four G for Verizon to do,

194
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:52,780
they allow you to make phone
calls and access the Internet?

195
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:53,680
Um,

196
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,460
some of the devices I think
does four g but only on four G.

197
00:04:57,461 --> 00:04:57,890
Right?

198
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:58,720
The iPhone,

199
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,500
right.

200
00:04:59,500 --> 00:04:59,711
Yeah.

201
00:04:59,711 --> 00:05:01,300
The iPhone is always a step behind.

202
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,890
It was a step behind for the longest time.

203
00:05:02,891 --> 00:05:04,390
It was three g before it's four g.

204
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,210
But you used to have to pay something.

205
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,940
It used to cost if you want
to get off the iPhone tit,

206
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,871
like if you want it.

207
00:05:10,871 --> 00:05:11,351
Like I told you,

208
00:05:11,351 --> 00:05:12,580
I got an old android.

209
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:12,830
Oh,

210
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:15,760
I had that piece of shit
for one day and I was like,

211
00:05:15,761 --> 00:05:17,860
you gotta be fucking kidding me.

212
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,940
It was so clunky and shitty
compared to my iPhone.

213
00:05:21,941 --> 00:05:24,790
It wasn't even a question of whether
or not I was going to deal with it.

214
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:25,661
It was just like,

215
00:05:25,661 --> 00:05:27,940
you get the fuck Outta here with this.

216
00:05:27,941 --> 00:05:28,181
I'm like,

217
00:05:28,181 --> 00:05:30,850
this thing is dog shit immediate.

218
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:31,271
Oh,

219
00:05:31,271 --> 00:05:32,530
it was so bad.

220
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:33,790
It was such a piece of shit.

221
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:34,301
Yeah,

222
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:35,260
it was terrible.

223
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:35,981
It was so bad.

224
00:05:35,981 --> 00:05:37,870
But the new ones are dope.

225
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,000
They're like the galaxy s four is coming
out March 14th isn't that supposed to

226
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:44,080
be the next level?

227
00:05:44,081 --> 00:05:44,610
Shit.

228
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,443
Damn it.

229
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,660
Why didn't we get,

230
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,900
why even bother getting an android devices
and now there's new ones coming out

231
00:05:49,901 --> 00:05:51,930
on both apple and android.

232
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:52,180
I'm like,

233
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:52,271
oh,

234
00:05:52,271 --> 00:05:53,104
I need to.

235
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:54,790
Especially Samsung,

236
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,200
they don't fuck around man.

237
00:05:56,201 --> 00:06:00,080
They keep pumping out bad ass phones
and they for the first time ever,

238
00:06:00,081 --> 00:06:05,081
the galaxy s three outsold the
iPhone or a factory worker.

239
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,090
The fucking photos on that thing.

240
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:08,391
Oh,

241
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:09,081
it's incredible.

242
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:10,330
In fucking balloon.

243
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,270
They're incredible.

244
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,490
The new ones are going
to have ready for this.

245
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,250
A 13 motherfucking megapixel camera

246
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:19,670
and a phone.

247
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,070
The five facing cameras
going to be two megapixels.

248
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,960
It's rear camera's going to be 13.

249
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,040
Jesus.

250
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,111
My billing,

251
00:06:26,111 --> 00:06:29,290
I'm looking at my billing right now for
Ting and I haven't really used my phone

252
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:29,831
much,

253
00:06:29,831 --> 00:06:31,690
but like this month I used it a lot.

254
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,570
So my building's been $14 for one month,

255
00:06:34,571 --> 00:06:36,070
$13 for another month,

256
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,930
and then this month it's going to be,

257
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,120
it looks like $25.

258
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:40,983
That's amazing.

259
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,340
That's amazing.

260
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,270
Like I,

261
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,370
this month I've used megabytes.

262
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,130
I've used a 250 megabytes.

263
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,830
Does that my Wifi so much
that I don't really use it.

264
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:53,590
I've seen some bills
that have been crippling,

265
00:06:53,591 --> 00:06:54,090
man.

266
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:54,421
Yeah.

267
00:06:54,421 --> 00:06:56,430
You can fuck your life
up with a cell phone.

268
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:56,611
Oh,

269
00:06:56,611 --> 00:06:57,361
you sure can.

270
00:06:57,361 --> 00:06:58,200
Especially if you,

271
00:06:58,201 --> 00:07:01,740
you don't know your policy and you go
over and you get hit with some overages or

272
00:07:01,741 --> 00:07:05,340
travel and you don't
really consider oh yeah.

273
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,210
International stuff.

274
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:06,690
Yeah.

275
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,640
International will crush you.

276
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,740
Go to rogan.ting.com savory stuff.

277

278

You fucks also were brought to you
by [inaudible] Dot com that's o.

280
00:07:15,241 --> 00:07:16,650
N.

281
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:16,650
N.

282
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:16,650
I.

283
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:16,800
T.

284
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,740
We've got a lot of cool
shit and place a these days.

285
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,940
Not just,

286
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:21,500
uh,

287
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,680
the supplements that we've,

288
00:07:22,681 --> 00:07:23,100
um,

289
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,510
been selling for a while.

290
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,010
But we also have steel maces and
steel clubs that were selling.

291
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,220
We're trying to sell you the
most gangster Shit available,

292
00:07:32,221 --> 00:07:32,971
ladies and gentlemen,

293
00:07:32,971 --> 00:07:34,380
including killer bee honey.

294
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,080
But now we have the steel clubs.

295
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,750
They're also referred to as club bells.

296
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,010
I use these all the time.

297
00:07:41,011 --> 00:07:41,940
They're fucking awesome.

298
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,160
It's like a giant baseball bat,

299
00:07:44,161 --> 00:07:45,120
like a wiffle bat member.

300
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,640
The fat wiffle bat that you would always
try to grab because it was way better

301
00:07:47,641 --> 00:07:49,320
than a regular wiffle ball bat.

302
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:49,940
Oh sure.

303
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,360
Big Fat ones where you could really,

304
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,411
that's what these are like,

305
00:07:52,411 --> 00:07:54,390
but they're made of iron and your,

306
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:57,810
you do all these fucking crazy things
called the shield cats with them and all

307
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,040
these exercises with it.

308
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,170
Persian guys do.

309
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,400
The Iranian guys and Indian guys,

310
00:08:02,401 --> 00:08:03,660
a lot of Indian guys do it.

311
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:05,881
Friends.

312
00:08:05,881 --> 00:08:09,930
Kids love you in the fucking new shit
that we started selling at on it.

313
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,690
It's uh,

314
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:10,931
we,

315
00:08:10,931 --> 00:08:12,240
we have kettle bells now.

316
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,110
Battle ropes.

317
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,800
We have an amazing
kettle bell workout DVD.

318
00:08:16,801 --> 00:08:19,140
It's the extreme kettlebell cardio DVD.

319
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:19,610
Um,

320
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,360
if you are going to do that though,

321
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:24,850
I would really suggest
anybody that's interested in,

322
00:08:24,851 --> 00:08:29,851
in doing kettle bells or any particularly
or possibly dangerous exercise,

323
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,780
go and learn from a local guy.

324
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,860
Find a local guy who's a professional
instructor and Kettle Valley.

325
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,270
It won't take much time.

326
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,410
He can show you the,

327
00:08:40,411 --> 00:08:42,750
all the movements are fairly intuitive.

328
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,720
I'm sure a guy would let you videotape it,

329
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,291
you know,

330
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:46,431
and,

331
00:08:46,431 --> 00:08:50,280
and he could give you just some tips to
make sure that you don't hurt yourself.

332
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,061
You know,

333
00:08:51,061 --> 00:08:51,251
I'm,

334
00:08:51,251 --> 00:08:53,820
I'm going through some back
issues right now myself.

335
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:58,570
Nothing like I can still kick box at 100%.

336
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:00,270
I could still lift weights but,

337
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,960
but I have some disc issues,

338
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:02,440
you know?

339
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:02,950
Oh sure.

340
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:03,611
And you know,

341
00:09:03,611 --> 00:09:04,450
a lot of that,

342
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:05,501
you know,

343
00:09:05,501 --> 00:09:06,040
it's just,

344
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,960
it's going to happen if you
do something like Jujitsu.

345
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,780
But if you can avoid any kind of injury,

346
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,220
you really should.

347
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:12,880
Oh my God.

348
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,580
Anytime you can avoid any
kind of injury you should.

349
00:09:15,581 --> 00:09:20,581
And the best way to avoid an injury with
kettlebells is to use proper form and

350
00:09:20,921 --> 00:09:23,390
to learn from an instructor
what kettle bells are.

351
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,370
If you've never seen them before,

352
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,400
it's a circular ball on the bottom,

353
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,540
like the bell.

354
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:33,570
It's made out of iron and it has a
handle and it's a fic iron handle.

355
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:37,870
And what you do with these things is
you swing them around and you use your

356
00:09:37,871 --> 00:09:42,871
whole body to pick them up and it really
engages your core and your legs and

357
00:09:43,031 --> 00:09:48,031
your arms in like really weird functional
ways that help you like in real life,

358
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:52,870
whether it's in athletics or whether
it's in like just picking something up,

359
00:09:52,871 --> 00:09:54,640
the ability to pick something up
and move it around your house,

360
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:57,040
you'll have more strength
of your whole body.

361
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:57,871
Like A,

362
00:09:57,871 --> 00:09:59,890
I was hanging out with
this dude really recently,

363
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,490
um,

364
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,260
who was a bodybuilder guy,

365
00:10:02,261 --> 00:10:03,970
but he had like this
little toothpick legs.

366
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:04,721
It's like,

367
00:10:04,721 --> 00:10:08,060
it's so crazy because all he's doing is
like doing bench press and curls does,

368
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,950
it makes you look good.

369
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:12,640
But then he's got these toothpicks that
are holding all that up because he's not

370
00:10:12,641 --> 00:10:15,400
using his whole body at the same time.

371
00:10:15,401 --> 00:10:16,330
You see that at every gym.

372
00:10:16,331 --> 00:10:16,751
By the way,

373
00:10:16,751 --> 00:10:18,610
you see that guy who's so on athletic,

374
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:22,270
dangerous for your body because
you could break shit like that.

375
00:10:22,271 --> 00:10:24,160
That's when you blow hamstrings.

376
00:10:24,161 --> 00:10:25,120
That's when you know you're,

377
00:10:25,121 --> 00:10:25,331
you're,

378
00:10:25,331 --> 00:10:26,410
you're designed wrong.

379
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,250
Absolutely.

380
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,870
Putting all that power
up in your upper body.

381
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:29,340
Um,

382
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,880
I don't look sexy girls,

383
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:31,743
but you know what?

384
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,321
But you know,

385
00:10:32,321 --> 00:10:32,560
the,

386
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,670
the main thing if you're going to start
with kettle bells too is if you seek out

387
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,570
that local guy,

388
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,310
you're going to learn technique.

389
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,290
And even if you're already athletic,

390
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,680
what was that?

391
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:42,990
I don't know.

392
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,140
Sounds like a door shut.

393
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,710
Something happened here.

394
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,520
The feds.

395
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,230
Did you hear about the for?

396
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:47,420
Well,

397
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:47,840
it's all,

398
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,673
sorry about that later.

399
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:48,951
Anyway,

400
00:10:48,951 --> 00:10:49,310
listen.

401
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:49,750
Um,

402
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,230
i.com o n n,

403
00:10:51,231 --> 00:10:52,041
I t a.

404
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:52,701
We met the,

405
00:10:52,701 --> 00:10:53,030
uh,

406
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:55,010
the audit power lifter guy this weekend.

407
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,210
It was very nice guy.

408
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,400
It sucks when you talk about back issues,

409
00:10:59,401 --> 00:10:59,611
you know,

410
00:10:59,611 --> 00:11:02,010
you're getting old when it
doesn't involve comic books.

411
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:03,363
Yeah,

412
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
that's actually a pretty good joke.

413
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,450
That's a good joke for nerds.

414
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,400
Are we about to get raided?

415
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,830
A big truck just stopped.

416
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:13,670
Um,

417
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,120
anyway,

418
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,601
go there.

419
00:11:14,601 --> 00:11:17,450
Check out all the different
supplements as well.

420
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,280
And if you use the code named Rogan,

421
00:11:19,281 --> 00:11:21,620
you will save 10% off
any of the supplements.

422
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:21,890
All right,

423
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:22,760
go check it out.

424
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:24,271
But listen,

425
00:11:24,271 --> 00:11:25,460
if you were at the event,

426
00:11:25,461 --> 00:11:26,600
the back of the kettle bells,

427
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:27,240
if you,

428
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,440
even if you're already athletic,

429
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:33,360
if you get somebody that shows you
technically how to do even a small change,

430
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:33,930
like,

431
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:34,081
oh,

432
00:11:34,081 --> 00:11:34,920
your hips are like this,

433
00:11:34,921 --> 00:11:36,330
you should move him here.

434
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,130
It can really prevent an injury.

435
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:38,550
Yes.

436
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,630
And it's a lot of times,

437
00:11:39,631 --> 00:11:40,710
even if you are like,

438
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:42,420
you've worked out a lot,

439
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,290
it's a thing that you haven't done
before and you don't realize it until

440
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,760
somebody who knows what
they're talking about.

441
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:48,540
Yeah,

442
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:48,871
it could.

443
00:11:48,871 --> 00:11:50,030
You could find to do this.

444
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:50,370
Yeah.

445
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,620
You can find yourself doing
any kind of weightlifting,

446
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:52,970
any,

447
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:53,960
any kind of exercise.

448
00:11:53,961 --> 00:11:54,410
Really.

449
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:54,860
Um,

450
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,150
so gay self in shape,

451
00:11:56,151 --> 00:11:57,380

00:11:58,521 --> 00:11:59,060
Rogan.

454
00:11:59,060 --> 00:11:59,960
Save yourself some money.

455
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:00,853
All right,

456
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,630
Brian.

457
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,463
Red Band.

458
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:05,690
Chew the Music Thompson Jurors here.

459
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,020
We're fixing to be crazy.

460
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,970
The Joe Rogan experience,

461
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:15,940
Joe Rogan podcast all day.

462
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,000
We're full Tommy bonds.

463
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:22,780
Yo,

464
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,141
Tami,

465
00:12:23,141 --> 00:12:26,440
please tell me about
white girls with cornrows.

466
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,030
Very dangerous.

467
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:30,813
Very dangerous.

468
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,780
That's the cover.

469
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,620
That's the name of your,

470
00:12:32,621 --> 00:12:32,771
uh,

471
00:12:32,771 --> 00:12:33,551
your latest CD,

472
00:12:33,551 --> 00:12:33,811
right?

473
00:12:33,811 --> 00:12:33,890
Well,

474
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:34,300
yeah,

475
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:34,721
yeah.

476
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:35,050
White.

477
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,340
Why white girls with cornrows?

478
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,150
Just a very,

479
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:40,150
I think of them as a very dangerous,

480
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,580
often overlooked segment of our society.

481
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,780
So what's a,

482
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:47,760
what's dangerous about,

483
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,030
I tried to clarify,

484
00:12:49,031 --> 00:12:49,481
first of all,

485
00:12:49,481 --> 00:12:54,481
for people that I don't mean like
white girls that just got back from The

486
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,443
Bahamas.

487
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,850
I mean like white girls
to live in Baltimore.

488
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,110
Curious downtown chicks.

489
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,990
Baltimore's sure it's real dude.

490
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:05,331
Yeah.

491
00:13:05,331 --> 00:13:05,970
And Paul Tomorrow.

492
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:09,670
So rough and the d the d scary right now.

493
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,380
I just did three weeks in a row.

494
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:12,431
No,

495
00:13:12,431 --> 00:13:13,264
I did,

496
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,140
uh,

497
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,010
Baltimore,

498
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:17,663
Baltimore,

499
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,650
then Cleveland and then
Detroit back to back to back.

500
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,311
I was like,

501
00:13:21,311 --> 00:13:21,611
dude,

502
00:13:21,611 --> 00:13:25,600
I'm doing like recovering
cities of America places.

503
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,433
I'm not going.

504
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,010
Those are the three.

505
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:27,130
I,

506
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:27,311
I,

507
00:13:27,311 --> 00:13:27,521
you know,

508
00:13:27,521 --> 00:13:31,810
I did Ann Arbor and I felt like I was in
a satellite colony outside of the death

509
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:32,560
star.

510
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,400
I felt like I was,

511
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,810
I was hanging out on like,

512
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,350
like some colony of white
people try to keep it together.

513
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:38,771
Well,

514
00:13:38,771 --> 00:13:40,540
there's state implodes around them.

515
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,840
There is a 47% illiteracy rate in Chicago
now or any serious Detroit right now.

516
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:52,120
Detroit is the one that leaves
the biggest impact for me.

517
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:52,900
Yeah.

518
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,201
Uh,

519
00:13:53,201 --> 00:13:54,130
when you drive through it.

520
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,060
Oh,

521
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,860
Baltimore's funny because Baltimore,

522
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,540
they're like,

523
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:03,540
it's all these rows where literally block
to block the everything changes when

524
00:14:04,991 --> 00:14:05,680
you're in the city.

525
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,513
Yeah.

526
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,090
So they're like,

527
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:07,241
no,

528
00:14:07,241 --> 00:14:08,080
these right here.

529
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,250
This is a really good neighborhood.

530
00:14:09,251 --> 00:14:12,550
These are families now you see
that next street right there.

531
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,110
You don't want to fuck
around on that street.

532
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:14,380
Yeah.

533
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,400
That one right there.

534
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:15,821
And they're like,

535
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:16,031
yeah,

536
00:14:16,031 --> 00:14:17,140
that's a bad neighborhood.

537
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:18,790
That's your neighborhood man.

538
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,003
No,

539
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:20,411
no.

540
00:14:20,411 --> 00:14:22,150
That's a whole different
neighborhood right there.

541
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,560
We saw that in DC.

542
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,521
Oh yeah.

543
00:14:24,521 --> 00:14:25,090
We were talking,

544
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:28,810
I went to DC with Ari
and Ari grew up there.

545
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:28,981
Oh,

546
00:14:28,981 --> 00:14:29,330
that's right.

547
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:29,870
He went the,

548
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:30,790
it's where he first,

549
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:31,150
uh,

550
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:31,960
was uh,

551
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,730
he was doing stand up
at the Improv there too.

552
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,481
Um,

553
00:14:34,481 --> 00:14:37,210
when we went down the
street as we're driving,

554
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,370
we're in this terrible neighborhood.

555
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,960
I mean it's really bad.

556
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,670
It's just like liquor stores,

557
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,220
people hanging out half naked on a corner.

558
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:46,060
It's just,

559
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:51,060
it looked like it was real sketch and
then two blocks over there's Volvos

560
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,040
and shiny white people climbing
out with your baby carriages.

561
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:57,821
I'm like,

562
00:14:57,821 --> 00:14:58,631
Whoa,

563
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,220
what the fuck is this?

564
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:01,450
This is crazy.

565
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,440
It was downtown La.

566
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,101
Nah,

567
00:15:03,101 --> 00:15:03,280
it was,

568
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,020
it was way more extreme.

569
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,180
It's way more extreme on the east coast.

570
00:15:07,181 --> 00:15:12,181
The east coast has a completely
different sense of like integration.

571
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,800
There's integration in like New York City,

572
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:18,310
but you just don't get in Los
Angeles because nobody walks.

573
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:18,880
Right.

574
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,151
You know?

575
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:20,830
So I think you live on top of each other.

576
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:25,270
Living on top of each other is standard
being on top of it or the being around

577
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,370
people of all sorts of races,

578
00:15:27,371 --> 00:15:28,181
nationalities,

579
00:15:28,181 --> 00:15:31,210
origins of to be around them all
the time like you are in New York.

580
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:36,480
I think it leads people to be more open
to the idea of being around people that

581
00:15:37,391 --> 00:15:39,730
aren't in their same economic
group to being closer to them.

582
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:40,510
Definitely.

583
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,800
Whereas like in la,

584
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,641
everybody's like,

585
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:44,440
get me the fuck out of this neighborhood.

586
00:15:44,441 --> 00:15:44,561
Like,

587
00:15:44,561 --> 00:15:45,100
you know,

588
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:45,940
you don't want to like,

589
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,270
like have a nice place in the hood
that is not even in the question.

590
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:49,591
No,

591
00:15:49,591 --> 00:15:49,770
no,

592
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:50,080
no.

593
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,430
You know,

594
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:55,380
and Ellie's really sliced and diced where
you know exactly where everything is.

595
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,390
Like my dad's this neighborhood,

596
00:15:57,391 --> 00:15:58,200
this is this kind of,

597
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,033
yeah,

598
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,410
it's very obvious.

599
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,700
There's no integration.

600
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,010
My friend Mo lives in Bedstuy in Brooklyn.

601
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,993
He's a white guy.

602
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,480
I really,

603
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:05,900
yeah,

604
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,141
I could,

605
00:16:06,141 --> 00:16:07,190
why do you live in bed Stuy?

606
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,360
That's where Mike Tyson grew
up and talks about crazy.

607
00:16:09,361 --> 00:16:09,770
It was,

608
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:10,041
he goes,

609
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:10,251
well,

610
00:16:10,251 --> 00:16:10,461
you know,

611
00:16:10,461 --> 00:16:11,720
they've cleaned it up quite a bit,

612
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:12,350
you know,

613
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:12,861
it goes a,

614
00:16:12,861 --> 00:16:13,880
nobody bothers us.

615
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:14,691
And uh,

616
00:16:14,691 --> 00:16:15,141
you know,

617
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:18,740
I would rather live in a place like
that and be able to afford an apartment.

618
00:16:18,741 --> 00:16:20,870
I can move around and
then live in a box and,

619
00:16:20,871 --> 00:16:21,091
and,

620
00:16:21,091 --> 00:16:21,924
and the city.

621
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,023
Wow.

622
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,230
I guess it's like,

623
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:27,410
that's one of the reasons why a lot of
these neighborhoods have gotten better.

624
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:27,770
You know,

625
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,270
the idea of gentrification,

626
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:30,350
the idea of like,

627
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:33,260
and that's happened over and over
again in New York when they realize,

628
00:16:33,261 --> 00:16:33,920
hey look,

629
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,330
we've got a bad neighborhood,

630
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,750
but it's just a neighborhood that's
got a bunch of shitty places.

631
00:16:38,751 --> 00:16:41,980
If we buy those shitty places
and start building nice places,

632
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,910
then it's a good neighborhood.

633
00:16:42,911 --> 00:16:43,160
Yeah.

634
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,470
And then it's worth a lot of fucking
money and it can happen like that.

635
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,210
It's happened on the east side of La.

636
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:47,400
Yeah.

637
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,080
A lot more.

638
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,370
Los Filez silver lake.

639
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:49,560
Yeah.

640
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,570
The area that used to be an area that
like white people didn't really just fuck

641
00:16:53,571 --> 00:16:54,440
around in at all.

642
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,030
You know,

643
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:55,610
it's uh,

644
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:57,890
and then it's like a good artist area.

645
00:16:58,290 --> 00:16:59,900
But I'm saying like 20 years ago,

646
00:16:59,901 --> 00:17:00,630
like most,

647
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,220
you know,

648
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:01,610
it was,

649
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:02,330
it was a lot of,

650
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:06,020
it was much more Latin population
and then now it's like,

651
00:17:06,021 --> 00:17:06,170
uh,

652
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:06,890
you know,

653
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:11,890
hipster community sliced and diced with
a little bit of the Latinos that were

654
00:17:12,321 --> 00:17:13,640
there predominantly.

655
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:18,250
So it's become like one bad motherfucker
hipster move in and you know,

656
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:21,170
I have to imagine it's the
same scenario as your friend.

657
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,670
I imagine it's the same scenario.

658
00:17:22,671 --> 00:17:23,090
I bet.

659
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:23,510
You know?

660
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,480
Whereas as one dude or a
couple people were like,

661
00:17:26,481 --> 00:17:28,700
well we can get this bigger
place and just kind of,

662
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:29,630
you know,

663
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:34,630
less desirable part of town for really
cheap and then over time that slowly

664
00:17:35,151 --> 00:17:36,290
becomes a thing and then they've,

665
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,030
you know,

666
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,810
populated an area and
it totally changed it.

667
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:39,261
Yeah.

668
00:17:39,261 --> 00:17:40,094
It's kind of crazy.

669
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:40,860
It's really,

670
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,571
that'd be crazy.

671
00:17:41,571 --> 00:17:42,740
That happened in bedstuy though.

672
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,330
Oh B

673
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:47,950
it could easily happen because so many
people spilling over from Manhattan.

674
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:48,280
Yeah.

675
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,060
There's so much money mean it's
like a slow creep of money.

676
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:51,850
You know?

677
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,370
Those prices are insane.

678
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:53,611
Oh,

679
00:17:53,611 --> 00:17:54,390
it's amazing.

680
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:54,720
Yeah.

681
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,410
Like you look at some of the apartments
that are for sale and you like,

682
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,720
they're like $4 million and it's
like a $1,200 Burbank apart.

683
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:03,790
It's so nuts,

684
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,180
man.

685
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,140
It's so crazy.

686
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:07,870
I stayed in an apartment in
midtown that was 4,600 a month,

687
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,300
4,600 a month.

688
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,790
Oh my God.

689
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:12,910
The Guy was playing rank.

690
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:13,661
Nice.

691
00:18:13,661 --> 00:18:14,494
Two bedroom.

692
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:14,770
Uh,

693
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:15,160
not,

694
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,821
not particularly.

695
00:18:15,821 --> 00:18:16,654
Like,

696
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:17,650
like,

697
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:17,981
you know,

698
00:18:17,981 --> 00:18:18,520
wow.

699
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,091
But Nice.

700
00:18:19,091 --> 00:18:19,691
Like where you go,

701
00:18:19,691 --> 00:18:19,971
right?

702
00:18:19,971 --> 00:18:20,290
Yeah.

703
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,310
You have a nice apartment,

704
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:22,240
right?

705
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:22,661
Never.

706
00:18:22,661 --> 00:18:24,460
And you're in my mind,

707
00:18:24,461 --> 00:18:27,960
was it going to be 4,600
that's a crazy mortgage.

708
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,890
That's a mortgage for $1 million house.

709
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,270
And I told the guy,

710
00:18:31,271 --> 00:18:32,080
I go,

711
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,610
don't you think you could
get like $1 million house?

712
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,001
He was like,

713
00:18:34,001 --> 00:18:34,630
yeah,

714
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:35,620
I'm going to do that sometime.

715
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:36,490
I was like,

716
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,323
whoa.

717
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:37,961
Wow Man.

718
00:18:37,961 --> 00:18:38,111
Yeah,

719
00:18:38,111 --> 00:18:39,710
but people love the people that

720
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:40,860
love living there.

721
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,560
Love live in there so much.

722
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,583
Yeah.

723
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,260
My,

724
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,210
my friend Jeff,

725
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,440
he fucking,

726
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,970
he would never live anywhere else.

727
00:18:47,971 --> 00:18:49,560
He comes here like every now and again,

728
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:50,430
he's got a place here.

729
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:51,421
He'll come here,

730
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:51,811
but when he's,

731
00:18:51,811 --> 00:18:52,321
when he's here,

732
00:18:52,321 --> 00:18:52,651
he's like,

733
00:18:52,651 --> 00:18:53,484
get me back.

734
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,331
And he gets back.

735
00:18:54,331 --> 00:18:54,571
He was like,

736
00:18:54,571 --> 00:18:55,500
this is where I love it.

737
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:56,190
I love it here.

738
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,990
He loves the city being in there.

739
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:00,120
I can see that you fall in
love with that city though.

740
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:00,481
It's,

741
00:19:00,481 --> 00:19:01,170
you know,

742
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:01,981
a lot of people love it,

743
00:19:01,981 --> 00:19:02,520
man.

744
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,480
A lot of people love it.

745
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:04,440
For a lot of people.

746
00:19:04,441 --> 00:19:05,520
It's like that,

747
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,740
that idea of having
everybody packed in together,

748
00:19:07,741 --> 00:19:08,574
they feel happy.

749
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:09,050
Yeah.

750
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:09,390
You know,

751
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:12,060
there's really is something
like always going on.

752
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:12,850
Yeah.

753
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:13,420
Oh yes.

754
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,540
And I don't mean just like an activity,

755
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:18,900
a party like just being on
the standing on a corner.

756
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,640
The street feels alive.

757
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:21,150
Yeah.

758
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,080
There's just always,

759
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:22,510
you know,

760
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,343
there's action.

761
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:28,400
People are remarkably cool in New York
when you consider how big that's it is.

762
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:28,970
Yeah.

763
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:30,500
I mean they're remarkably cool.

764
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:34,130
Like people talk about how people are
rude and the east coast like that.

765
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:34,964
Not that rude.

766
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,160
And I,

767
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,660
I think New Yorkers are
particularly friendly actually.

768
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:41,570
I mean they're a little
less tolerant of idiots,

769
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:46,130
but I think that the intelligence level
that the average intelligence level of

770
00:19:46,131 --> 00:19:46,964
people in the city,

771
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,410
it's like a little higher.

772
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,990
I tell him it's higher than Los Angeles.

773
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:51,940
Like you,

774
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,380
you,

775
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:56,690
the odds of you meeting a guy not
knowing him very well and having a good

776
00:19:56,691 --> 00:19:57,620
conversation with them.

777
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:57,951
Like,

778
00:19:57,951 --> 00:20:01,970
say if you're in a waiting room and he
strike up a conversation and it being a

779
00:20:01,971 --> 00:20:05,300
really interesting conversation and the
odds are way better in New York than

780
00:20:05,301 --> 00:20:06,134
they are in La.

781
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,493
Great.

782
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,760
Great observation.

783
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,290
And 1000% agree.

784
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:12,870
And not only that,

785
00:20:12,871 --> 00:20:16,590
I feel like La has a way
higher sketch ball factor.

786
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,960
Oh look at this fucking guy.

787
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:22,170
Not like total hose artists.

788
00:20:22,171 --> 00:20:22,600
Yeah.

789
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:27,600
You're going to roofie some chick just
way high bullshit meters off the chain

790
00:20:27,841 --> 00:20:28,230
here.

791
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,340
But you kind of go like,

792
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,050
Nah.

793
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:30,883
Yeah.

794
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:35,460
And actually in New York you see
some guy who might be like eccentric,

795
00:20:35,461 --> 00:20:37,050
kind of weird as shit looking,

796
00:20:37,051 --> 00:20:40,950
but then he's like a super intelligent
guy that you can have a great

797
00:20:40,951 --> 00:20:41,471
conversation.

798
00:20:41,471 --> 00:20:41,750
Yeah.

799
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,230
Yeah.

800
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,400
It's super possible.

801
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,960
And I mean not that you have,

802
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:47,260
not that you would really
use it if you were there,

803
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:50,770
but you have access if you're in
New York to the all those museums.

804
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:51,630
Yeah.

805
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:52,660
Just that alone,

806
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:55,090
having all that stuff right there.

807
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,111
I mean you're,

808
00:20:56,111 --> 00:20:57,160
you're dealing with,

809
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,930
there's so many great museums.

810
00:20:58,990 --> 00:20:59,291
Oh yeah.

811
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,360
There's so much cool shit to see.

812
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,520
And there's a Neil Tyson's place.

813
00:21:03,521 --> 00:21:03,851
The,

814
00:21:03,851 --> 00:21:04,030
uh,

815
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:04,241
what,

816
00:21:04,241 --> 00:21:04,460
what,

817
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,550
what does that a astronomy place Brian,

818
00:21:06,551 --> 00:21:10,870
but they have that huge place that
he's the one at Griffith Park.

819
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:11,830
Is that it is the Griffin?

820
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,071
No,

821
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:13,690
he doesn't do the
Griffith Park Observatory.

822
00:21:13,691 --> 00:21:14,524
That's out here.

823
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,453
He does something.

824
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,600
I was watching part of that
podcast you did with this awesome.

825
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,120
You know,

826
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:24,120
it's really fun to watch as
somebody who's just vocabulary is,

827
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:24,401
you know,

828
00:21:24,401 --> 00:21:25,420
there's so our ticket,

829
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,263
yeah.

830
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,700
It's actually fun to listen to them
speak because they speak so richly.

831
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:31,330
Yeah.

832
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:36,330
So clearly I was like listening to
him speak and then missing what he was

833
00:21:36,911 --> 00:21:37,720
saying.

834
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,261
You know what I mean?

835
00:21:38,261 --> 00:21:39,094
Like,

836
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:41,230
like he kinda hypnotizes you in a way.

837
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,520
He has a beautiful voice.

838
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:43,563
He's a beautiful man.

839
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,320
He has a beautiful man,

840
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,990
but he's his what's,

841
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:52,110
there's something to be said about the
tonal quality of someone's voice and

842
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:55,030
their ability to understand
what they sound like.

843
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,620
And a lot of people don't know that.

844
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:00,430
A lot of people who are super obnoxious
and come off really fucking bad.

845
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,410
One of the reasons why they come off bad,

846
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:06,640
it's like they're not registering that
their intent is not being accurately

847
00:22:06,641 --> 00:22:08,400
displayed by the way the communicate it.

848
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:08,800
Yeah.

849
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:13,120
There's like an the sounds that people
don't like hearing this sharpness that's

850
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:13,890
necessary.

851
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:15,730
The misunderstandings a lot
with what you're saying.

852
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,271
Yeah,

853
00:22:16,271 --> 00:22:17,010
absolutely.

854
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:17,230
Yeah.

855
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:17,441
Well,

856
00:22:17,441 --> 00:22:20,530
what he does so well is he knows how,

857
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:20,981
first of all,

858
00:22:20,981 --> 00:22:22,000
he's got a beautiful voice.

859
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,820
He knows how to use the voice,

860
00:22:23,821 --> 00:22:26,290
and he's got an immense vocabulary.

861
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:31,000
He's got an immense amount of knowledge
when it comes to the cosmos and you

862
00:22:31,001 --> 00:22:31,241
know,

863
00:22:31,241 --> 00:22:32,830
and most of the stuff he's saying,

864
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,270
you've never heard it before,

865
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:38,140
but he knows it intimately and
he's super passionate about it.

866
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:38,380
Right.

867
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,750
So it's like got a sense of theater to it,

868
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:43,690
but it's also an insane information.

869
00:22:43,691 --> 00:22:45,580
Like he was telling us
information about the,

870
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:48,310
the actual possible size of the universe.

871
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,120
And it just,

872
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,230
it just makes you,

873
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:54,460
it just makes you want to just not say
anything for like 10 minutes and just go,

874
00:22:54,461 --> 00:22:55,000
what?

875
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,833
Yeah.

876
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,130
Jesus.

877
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,240
It's incredible.

878
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:58,511
Yeah.

879
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:03,511
Those guys are so important because
science so often is dry to kids.

880
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,920
Like a lot of kids think
that science is like,

881
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:10,390
you know the idea of
studying stars like Eh,

882
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,230
it's,

883
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:14,320
it seems like doll and
this is serious five,

884
00:23:14,321 --> 00:23:14,681
this is,

885
00:23:14,681 --> 00:23:16,420
this is a but but blah blah blah.

886
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:17,610
The orbiter went around,

887
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:22,920
they don't have this like engaging like
contagious passion that he has and when

888
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:24,430
kids hear him talk,

889
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,230
they get super pumped up about it.

890
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:26,470
You know,

891
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:30,400
as they should imagine if he were your
teacher and like school and like I

892
00:23:30,401 --> 00:23:31,234
wouldn't probably,

893
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,710
I would have probably
never been a comedian.

894
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:32,991
Yeah,

895
00:23:32,991 --> 00:23:33,520
I know.

896
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,320
I would've probably tried to
be a scientist or something.

897
00:23:35,321 --> 00:23:36,460
I would have tried to be an astronomer.

898
00:23:36,461 --> 00:23:36,760
I forgot.

899
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,720
Like that was my teacher.

900
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,920
He would have been my hero.

901
00:23:38,921 --> 00:23:39,491
You know what I mean?

902
00:23:39,491 --> 00:23:39,790
You know,

903
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,623
to,

904
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,720
to like the,

905
00:23:41,721 --> 00:23:43,990
the average fucking kid.

906
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:49,230
It's like constantly searching for someone
that represents who they'd like to be

907
00:23:49,401 --> 00:23:50,450
when they get older.

908
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,320
You know?

909
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,430
Because if you're around,

910
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,780
even if you love your dad,

911
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:54,291
you know,

912
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:56,000
you're around your dad all the time.

913
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,220
There's most likely a
dad's and knucklehead,

914
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:58,761
you know,

915
00:23:58,761 --> 00:24:03,761
your dad was born 1940 whatever it is
for they're fucking idiots right from a

916
00:24:04,341 --> 00:24:05,360
different time.

917
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,330
And so then you go to school
and who you're dealing with,

918
00:24:08,331 --> 00:24:08,700
school,

919
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,150
you punch.

920
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,520
People don't really want that job.

921
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,990
They just can't do anything else.

922
00:24:11,991 --> 00:24:15,470
And most of them are really
miserable in their personal life.

923
00:24:15,471 --> 00:24:18,110
And if you knew them
today as a grown adult,

924
00:24:18,111 --> 00:24:19,280
you would think there were fools.

925
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:19,700
Yeah.

926
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,740
But back then there the
figures of authority.

927
00:24:21,741 --> 00:24:25,220
So it puts this sort of helpless feeling
to you because you know their tools.

928
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:25,520
Yeah.

929
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,930
You know there are tools and you know,

930
00:24:26,931 --> 00:24:28,250
they're teaching you and you know,

931
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:29,390
this is nonsense.

932
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:29,691
They don't,

933
00:24:29,691 --> 00:24:32,180
they're not into this at all
and they don't want to be here.

934
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:35,180
And that's the majority of the
teaching experiences that I had.

935
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:37,160
The of being taught being class.

936
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:37,851
Absolutely.

937
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:38,320
Yeah.

938
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,000
It was a few standout guys
who was a guy named Greg,

939
00:24:41,001 --> 00:24:41,930
who was a Spanish teacher,

940
00:24:41,931 --> 00:24:42,764
was really cool.

941
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:46,760
But Greg wound up bang and
the 17 year old hall law.

942
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:49,010
Really if it was legal or not.

943
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:51,080
I remember Mr Keener's breath

944
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:53,563
fifth grade,

945
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,010
if you had Neil Tyson.

946
00:24:55,011 --> 00:24:55,130
Yeah.

947
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:55,700
For uh,

948
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,451
a professor,

949
00:24:56,451 --> 00:24:57,020
you'd be,

950
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,160
you'd be a fucking scientist.

951
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:59,083
Totally.

952
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:01,520
You were trying to do something
in that world for sure.

953
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:02,570
That world man,

954
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:06,530
when those guys landed the rover on Mars
and started screaming and cheering when

955
00:25:06,531 --> 00:25:07,370
the pictures started coming up,

956
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,520
yeah.

957
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,080
You realize like how exciting.

958
00:25:10,081 --> 00:25:11,020
That must have been fun again,

959
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,450
it's so,

960
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:16,860
because the idea that they were embracing
was so crazy that stream and you had

961
00:25:16,861 --> 00:25:18,930
so many detractors and you get people,

962
00:25:18,931 --> 00:25:19,501
you would say that too.

963
00:25:19,501 --> 00:25:19,891
And they were like,

964
00:25:19,891 --> 00:25:21,090
are you fucking stupid?

965
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:22,980
Like smart people would say that to you.

966
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:25,260
They're talking about
sending people to Mars,

967
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,153
you know,

968
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,180
and they're talking about,

969
00:25:27,181 --> 00:25:27,540
uh,

970
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,230
you know,

971
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:28,710
right.

972
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:31,620
There's even a new thing about,

973
00:25:31,621 --> 00:25:32,310
uh,

974
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:36,330
whether or not they should send couples
because they probably won't ever be able

975
00:25:36,331 --> 00:25:37,164
to come back.

976
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:37,700
Okay,

977
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,533
dude.

978
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,710
Now imagine that.

979
00:25:39,711 --> 00:25:42,410
Imagine for a second if
they pulled that off,

980
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,600
what our reaction would be watching that.

981
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,031
Like if,

982
00:25:45,031 --> 00:25:45,220
if,

983
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,640
if they landed and they were like,

984
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:46,910
oh,

985
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:47,571
we're on Mars,

986
00:25:47,571 --> 00:25:48,560
it's fucking awesome here.

987
00:25:48,561 --> 00:25:48,921
You guys,

988
00:25:48,921 --> 00:25:49,400
we would be like,

989
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,233
oh my God,

990
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,190
what did he say

991
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,023
back to

992
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,590
rescue us?

993
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,700
It takes six

994
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,720
some months to get there.

995
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:57,680
Oh my God.

996
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:58,820
What if they didn't know?

997
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,500
But that there's a constant

998
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:01,823
wow.

999
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,640
Back Mars.

1000
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:09,020
Nobody recorded any sound and I don't
realize it until they open the hatch.

1001
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:13,020
This the planet makes us sound shit.

1002
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:13,960
Oh Shit.

1003
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:15,721
Pick you up.

1004
00:26:15,721 --> 00:26:16,620
It's going to be awhile.

1005
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:18,090
And we're just smell like pussy,

1006
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:20,123
pussy,

1007
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:22,970
rats.

1008
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:23,171
The,

1009
00:26:23,171 --> 00:26:24,620
they can't pick you up at all.

1010
00:26:24,621 --> 00:26:25,640
They can't get you.

1011
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:29,510
They can send more people to
hug you and give you your plugs.

1012
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:30,470
She can't,

1013
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,250
they can't send,

1014
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,110
they can't send you back there.

1015
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:37,040
The first trips they believe with
people are going to be one way trips.

1016
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,030
Really?

1017
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:38,863
Yes.

1018
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,460
But how would you drop them?

1019
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:41,480
What would you leave them with?

1020
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,010
W with enough to live with what?

1021
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:43,610
You know,

1022
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:43,980
um,

1023
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,731
you got to get one of them,

1024
00:26:44,731 --> 00:26:45,564
boy scout knives.

1025
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:46,930
They'd have like a bunch
of different things.

1026
00:26:46,931 --> 00:26:50,170
So it's a spoon and a magnifying glass.

1027
00:26:50,171 --> 00:26:52,080
And you guys can make it
three weeks and they're like,

1028
00:26:52,081 --> 00:26:52,590
what,

1029
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,250
three weeks?

1030
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,120
Oh Man.

1031
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,080
Fuck that.

1032
00:26:55,081 --> 00:26:56,010
No it's not.

1033
00:26:56,011 --> 00:26:57,180
It can't be cool enough.

1034
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:57,751
There's no way.

1035
00:26:57,751 --> 00:27:00,330
I mean the idea of being
the first person on Mars,

1036
00:27:00,331 --> 00:27:03,180
I'm sure it's going to be
appealing to a lot of people,

1037
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,231
but not to me,

1038
00:27:04,231 --> 00:27:04,590
man.

1039
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:04,921
To me,

1040
00:27:04,921 --> 00:27:05,400
I'd be like,

1041
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:05,791
listen,

1042
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,590
I'm not living in some fucking movie.

1043
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,370
Okay,

1044
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:08,640
you,

1045
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,061
you're not,

1046
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:10,970
I'm not going to be the
first guy on Mars pitch.

1047
00:27:10,971 --> 00:27:12,540
Are you phrasing?

1048
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,090
Do you know how bad Mars could suck?

1049
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,333
Do you know back inside?

1050
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,550
Do you want to live in Antarctica?

1051
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,800
I don't want to live in New York,

1052
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:20,190
but living in Antarctica,

1053
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:20,970
I mean you,

1054
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:23,820
you might as well be living at arc
if you leave it on fucking Mars,

1055
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,450
might as well.

1056
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:24,691
Yeah,

1057
00:27:24,691 --> 00:27:25,380
that's,

1058
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,510
that's not desirable least man.

1059
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,310
Cause I'm pretty sure
you're going to have to,

1060
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:29,941
you know,

1061
00:27:29,941 --> 00:27:31,530
you're going to have to wear
a mask everywhere you go.

1062
00:27:31,531 --> 00:27:35,100
You're going to home or they're going
to have to put a dome over that bitch of

1063
00:27:35,101 --> 00:27:35,491
course.

1064
00:27:35,491 --> 00:27:36,360
And do you realize,

1065
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:41,420
I'm like how unpredictable the
entire thing from they get like shit.

1066
00:27:43,321 --> 00:27:43,591
They're like,

1067
00:27:43,591 --> 00:27:44,850
we thought it was going to be like this.

1068
00:27:44,851 --> 00:27:45,211
They're gonna be like,

1069
00:27:45,211 --> 00:27:45,391
yeah,

1070
00:27:45,391 --> 00:27:50,130
that's not really saying rocks and they
hurt like everything that you thought it

1071
00:27:50,131 --> 00:27:51,000
could be way,

1072
00:27:51,001 --> 00:27:51,481
way off,

1073
00:27:51,481 --> 00:27:51,710
man.

1074
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:52,191
Not only that,

1075
00:27:52,191 --> 00:27:52,470
right

1076
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,630
bet Mars gets more fucking asteroids.

1077
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:58,410
I bet they get more
impacts because Mars is,

1078
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:00,630
I'm,

1079
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,710
I hope I'm not wrong about this,

1080
00:28:01,711 --> 00:28:03,270
but as it's been explained to me,

1081
00:28:03,271 --> 00:28:06,810
there's something called boats
law and bodes law represents,

1082
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:11,580
it's a way of measuring
by gravity and mass.

1083
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:13,800
When you get a series of planets,

1084
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,380
when you measure the mass of one,

1085
00:28:16,381 --> 00:28:20,700
you can accurately predict how far away
the next plan should be and apparently

1086
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:25,730
the asteroid belt between Mars and
Jupiter is the only thing wrong with boats

1087
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:27,420
law in this source system.

1088
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:27,991
As explained,

1089
00:28:27,991 --> 00:28:28,471
explained to me,

1090
00:28:28,471 --> 00:28:29,304
I might be wrong,

1091
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:34,940
but that there's so many asteroids close
to Mars and Jupiter that most likely

1092
00:28:35,221 --> 00:28:39,570
the idea is that either that's leftover
shit from the formation of galaxies or

1093
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:44,750
it could be leftover from an impact
like earth one and earth to Earth at one

1094
00:28:45,121 --> 00:28:47,490
point in time was hit by another planet.

1095
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,661
Jesus Christ.

1096
00:28:48,661 --> 00:28:48,930
Yeah.

1097
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:51,120
That's like the main stream,

1098
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:51,530
uh,

1099
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:53,850
acceptance of how the moon was created.

1100
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:54,780
And um,

1101
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,120
the,

1102
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:55,420
the,

1103
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:55,861
you know,

1104
00:28:55,861 --> 00:28:56,041
the,

1105
00:28:56,041 --> 00:28:57,660
just the evolution of the earth itself.

1106
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:59,850
And so it was at one point in time,

1107
00:28:59,851 --> 00:29:01,410
we were actually hit by a planet.

1108
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:06,180
Imagine how dude hit by a planet.

1109
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,010
We got hit by a planet.

1110
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:12,030
So we basically became
an enormous ball of lava.

1111
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:12,280
Yeah.

1112
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:12,661
So like,

1113
00:29:12,661 --> 00:29:15,390
who knows how long before
everything cooled off.

1114
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:15,710
I mean,

1115
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:16,170
do you know,

1116
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:21,170
who knows how many thousands of fucking
years everything burned have to get hit

1117
00:29:21,181 --> 00:29:21,691
by a planet?

1118
00:29:21,691 --> 00:29:25,350
Plus a giant chunk of us came
flying off and became the moon.

1119
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:26,521
Yeah.

1120
00:29:26,521 --> 00:29:28,680
That's the whole idea of it all.

1121
00:29:28,681 --> 00:29:30,040
It seems it's,

1122
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,210
it's two fantastic.

1123
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:33,241
Well,

1124
00:29:33,241 --> 00:29:33,511
you know,

1125
00:29:33,511 --> 00:29:35,040
it's just as fantastic.

1126
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:35,791
It is.

1127
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:38,280
A planet floating above us every day.

1128
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:41,770
Every day we go outside in broad daylight.

1129
00:29:41,771 --> 00:29:44,170
You can see the Moon in
California because you know,

1130
00:29:44,171 --> 00:29:47,650
I know you poor folks in Columbus get
cloudy skies all throughout the winter.

1131
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:48,710
Um,

1132
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,800
Cincinnati was the same way this weekend,

1133
00:29:50,801 --> 00:29:52,300
but you come back to La,

1134
00:29:52,301 --> 00:29:53,560
you can see the moon in the middle of day.

1135
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:56,560
You'll see it fat and juicy
just sitting up in the sky.

1136
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,350
It looks all beautiful and the blue sky,

1137
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:03,520
it's a floating planet and you're
looking at it with your eyes and it's a

1138
00:30:03,521 --> 00:30:05,680
quarter of the size of the
earth and it's right there.

1139
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:06,110
Yeah,

1140
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:08,860
it's floating in the air above you.

1141
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:13,420
Like that might be the nuttiest shit
you ever get to look at and you're just

1142
00:30:13,421 --> 00:30:13,660
like,

1143
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:13,871
ah,

1144
00:30:13,871 --> 00:30:14,501
whatever.

1145
00:30:14,501 --> 00:30:15,670
I'm waiting for Ufo.

1146
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,880
The UFO ain't nearly as crazy as the fact
that there's a fucking planet floating

1147
00:30:21,401 --> 00:30:22,480
in the air.

1148
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:22,791
Yeah,

1149
00:30:22,791 --> 00:30:23,920
you can see it.

1150
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,720
You just got to make sense for real.

1151
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,041
Like a teacher.

1152
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:27,874
You're like that guy.

1153
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,290
The moon is enormous,

1154
00:30:29,291 --> 00:30:29,710
man.

1155
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:31,450
The moon is really big for food.

1156
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,960
We take it for granted how cool it is.

1157
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:33,820
See it.

1158
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,180
Well,

1159
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,160
you see the same side to,

1160
00:30:36,161 --> 00:30:37,420
it doesn't even spin.

1161
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,130
It rotates around us.

1162
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,330
The moon is a trip,

1163
00:30:40,331 --> 00:30:40,631
man.

1164
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:43,540
The moon's that trip and so many ways
because they say that if a moon wasn't as

1165
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:44,650
big as it is,

1166
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,590
our gravity or our,

1167
00:30:46,591 --> 00:30:47,170
um,

1168
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:48,760
atmosphere wouldn't be a stable,

1169
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,661
like our,

1170
00:30:49,661 --> 00:30:50,500
we wouldn't,

1171
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:51,020
our,

1172
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:51,371
our,

1173
00:30:51,371 --> 00:30:51,910
um,

1174
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:53,290
orbit wouldn't be a stable.

1175
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,550
And what stabilizes us is we have this
massive objects sitting there with us.

1176
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,420
Yeah,

1177
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,110
that's crazy.

1178
00:30:59,110 --> 00:30:59,943
That's nuts.

1179
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:03,480
Like an ordered liberty literally
to have this kind of life that,

1180
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:04,001
and people are like,

1181
00:31:04,001 --> 00:31:04,710
wow,

1182
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:05,141
they're going to do,

1183
00:31:05,141 --> 00:31:06,040
it'd be no life.

1184
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:06,850
No,

1185
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:08,110
it just wouldn't be this kind of life.

1186
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:11,410
Life with figures shit out for sure.

1187
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,430
Life figure shit out.

1188
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,353
You know?

1189
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:16,480
I'm just amazed that no one's ever
figured shit out in the ocean.

1190
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:17,860
And it's,

1191
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:18,790
there's so much of it,

1192
00:31:18,791 --> 00:31:19,030
man.

1193
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:19,870
It's a big,

1194
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:22,060
but like life never figured
shit out in the ocean.

1195
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:22,990
Oh right.

1196
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:25,030
Life in the ocean still lives like a fish.

1197
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:26,110
You know?

1198
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:29,560
Could you imagine if like we're running
around on earth claiming to be super

1199
00:31:29,561 --> 00:31:29,891
smart,

1200
00:31:29,891 --> 00:31:31,840
but we're still running around
killing things with her face.

1201
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:33,340
Yeah.

1202
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,120
We would say like,

1203
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,120
how are we any better
than than regular monkeys?

1204
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:37,630
We're not.

1205
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:37,811
Oh,

1206
00:31:37,811 --> 00:31:38,111
we are.

1207
00:31:38,111 --> 00:31:38,980
Because we have a language.

1208
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,510
Those poor dolphins,

1209
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,190
those poor fucks and killer whales,

1210
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,900
they live in like regular fish.

1211
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,180
They don't have condos.

1212
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:47,820
It's true of the car.

1213
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,350
They didn't have TVs and everybody's like,

1214
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:50,681
oh,

1215
00:31:50,681 --> 00:31:51,910
they're just as smartest people.

1216
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:53,740
The fuck they are the fuck they are.

1217
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:54,520
Stop it.

1218
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,660
They're not creating anything.

1219
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:56,170
Yeah.

1220
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:59,200
They could just make noise
with their face and catch fish.

1221
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,130
Just bigger fish.

1222
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,311
Yeah,

1223
00:32:00,311 --> 00:32:01,210
they did pig there.

1224
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:02,080
You know they're animals.

1225
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,530
They've taken the air through a poll,

1226
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:07,900
but basically they live like a fish.

1227
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,390
There's not much difference between
the killer whale on the tuna,

1228
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,300
you know?

1229
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:14,260
As far as like how the forced to live,

1230
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:16,930
you've got to go get
yours is no supermarket,

1231
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,190
no credit cards.

1232
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:19,870
They live like savages.

1233
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:20,410
They live.

1234
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:20,601
Yeah,

1235
00:32:20,601 --> 00:32:21,434
they are.

1236
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:23,650
They're just like the bottom feeding fish.

1237
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:24,010
Really?

1238
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:24,350
Yeah.

1239
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,061
They're ridiculous.

1240
00:32:25,061 --> 00:32:29,410
They're scrubs man scrubs the of the
universe and killer killer whale scrubs.

1241
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:33,430
Imagine if there really was intelligent
life in something figured out.

1242
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:34,510
I mean it doesn't seem,

1243
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:39,470
it seems to me that if a monkey can figure
out how to be conscious and how to be

1244
00:32:39,471 --> 00:32:40,400
a intelligent

1245
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,233
here,

1246
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,860
that a fish could figure out how to be
conscious and intelligent down there and

1247
00:32:45,861 --> 00:32:50,840
develop a way to get up to the air world
and wear like a a big water mask and

1248
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:51,650
come and visit us.

1249
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:52,490
They totally should,

1250
00:32:52,491 --> 00:32:56,510
but I think it doesn't happen because
of there'll be just too much conflict.

1251
00:32:56,511 --> 00:32:57,440
When we started talking,

1252
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,420
well he tried to open land parks.

1253
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,940
Apparently you haven't seen
creature from the black lagoon.

1254
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,833
I have not.

1255
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,420
This is what you ever see
that you ever see that movie?

1256
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,380
I watched that movie recently
learned to read and so dope.

1257
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:11,420
It's a Fishman Monster Fishman.

1258
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:12,201
Pull it up.

1259
00:33:12,201 --> 00:33:14,060
Brian Reed creature from the black lagoon.

1260
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:17,360
It's like a 1950s movie.

1261
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:18,470
Really think.

1262
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:19,200
Let me see.

1263
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,270
Creature from the black lagoon.

1264
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:20,961
I'm going to guess.

1265
00:33:20,961 --> 00:33:24,880
I'm going to guess I'm going
to go with 1961 but um,

1266
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:25,130
it's,

1267
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:27,770
I'm probably off 1951 is it 51.

1268
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:28,990
Okay.

1269
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:30,110
It's 1954.

1270
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:30,980
Really?

1271
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:31,813
Wow.

1272
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:32,900
It's a wow.

1273
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,770
Okay.

1274
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:34,101
Yeah,

1275
00:33:34,101 --> 00:33:35,300
so it's 1950s.

1276
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,223
Wow.

1277
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:36,801
I,

1278
00:33:36,801 --> 00:33:37,580
um,

1279
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,560
remember this when I was a kid,

1280
00:33:39,561 --> 00:33:40,970
he was like one of my favorite monsters,

1281
00:33:40,971 --> 00:33:41,804
man.

1282
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:43,790
Creature from the black hole was awesome.

1283
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:47,210
It only got a 6.9 on the IMD.

1284
00:33:47,211 --> 00:33:47,691
Be What?

1285
00:33:47,691 --> 00:33:48,860
A bunch of cons.

1286
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:50,800
I remember that was one of
those myriad of 10 out of 10.

1287
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:54,720
I'm sorry,

1288
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:55,431
but if you're,

1289
00:33:55,431 --> 00:33:57,950
if you're talking about
like old cool horror movies,

1290
00:33:57,951 --> 00:33:59,090
it's amazing.

1291
00:33:59,091 --> 00:34:02,990
It's a 10 that was one of those movies
they played in the 80s with the three d

1292
00:34:02,991 --> 00:34:06,410
glasses where you would go to the grocery
store and get those glasses and then

1293
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:11,020
the red and blue glasses and they
made it three d movie three days.

1294
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:14,510
They changed it and made it three
day to pull some of that up.

1295
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:15,344
It's awesome.

1296
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:17,420
It's looking at it,

1297
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,430
the creature from the black lagoon.

1298
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:23,990
Wow.

1299
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:24,291
Yeah.

1300
00:34:24,291 --> 00:34:25,820
There's no explanation.

1301
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,230
That's just where he lived.

1302
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,780
Where did he come from?

1303
00:34:29,781 --> 00:34:33,230
Did he interact with people
from science to haunt them?

1304
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:33,771
Oh yeah.

1305
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:34,850
He kidnapped bitches.

1306
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,451
Oh really?

1307
00:34:35,451 --> 00:34:36,680
I snatch pitches up,

1308
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:37,940
took them back to this case.

1309
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,600
He's trying to make a
more person person thing.

1310
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:42,440
I got you.

1311
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,150
I knew it'd be a person hybrid,

1312
00:34:44,151 --> 00:34:45,560
like he's a person fish hybrid.

1313
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,011
He's like,

1314
00:34:46,011 --> 00:34:50,570
I had to take the shit to
the next generation and that
it's just me as a hybrid.

1315
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,010
Fuck some white bitch.

1316
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:53,930
He definitely looks like a child.

1317
00:34:53,931 --> 00:34:55,490
Made them in the image that I saw.

1318
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:56,780
Well back then,

1319
00:34:56,781 --> 00:34:57,050
man,

1320
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,640
that was for fish it for,

1321
00:34:58,641 --> 00:35:00,740
that's an amazing outfit,

1322
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:01,640
you know?

1323
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,180
Yeah.

1324
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,370
He's got some pretty eccentric gear.

1325
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:05,780
Those guys had a struggle,

1326
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:06,740
you know,

1327
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:09,830
it was hard to do special
effects and the 1950s you know,

1328
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:12,400
did you ever see like even stuff and now
that you see from the eighties you're

1329
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:12,850
like,

1330
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:13,683
yes,

1331
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:14,840
this is embarrassing.

1332
00:35:14,841 --> 00:35:18,410
Is that the debt is the merch and mystery

1333
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:22,330
of a hundred million years ago

1334
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,230
up from the depths of unknown waters

1335
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:32,950
comes a creature to confound science

1336
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,470
and terrorize.

1337
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:38,323
No.

1338
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:41,440
Wow.

1339
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,340
These are awesome.

1340
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:43,661
Yeah,

1341
00:35:43,661 --> 00:35:45,850
he's got web fingers and claws and shit.

1342
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:50,890
Creature from the black lagoon and
it's all black and white and awesome.

1343
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:51,760
Shocking,

1344
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,040
shocking in the stark realism.

1345
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,280
Look at it when you make that up.

1346
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,310
Perfected three dimension
is black and white,

1347
00:36:00,311 --> 00:36:01,300
but it was three D.

1348
00:36:01,301 --> 00:36:02,590
Isn't that fascinating?

1349
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,530
Look how weak that dude looks.

1350
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,761
It looks back then,

1351
00:36:06,761 --> 00:36:08,520
didn't know nothing
about bench press then.

1352
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,900
I didn't know nothing about Kettlebell.

1353
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:15,400
He had no shroom tech sport and life
creatine going through his system.

1354
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,240
Those dudes didn't know deadlifts.

1355
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:19,000
Absolutely.

1356
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:20,350
They'll like that.

1357
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:24,870
Don't like their leading men back there
like a joke with their shirts off and

1358
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,870
you ever done a hack squat?

1359
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:27,490
You compare it to like the rock.

1360
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:28,270
Yeah,

1361
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:28,570
no.

1362
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:28,930
Right.

1363
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:30,660
Oh fuck.

1364
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:31,931
Oh my God.

1365
00:36:31,931 --> 00:36:32,321
Hot.

1366
00:36:32,321 --> 00:36:33,071
It never worked out.

1367
00:36:33,071 --> 00:36:35,950
A day in her life with a
billion eggs inside of her.

1368
00:36:35,951 --> 00:36:37,540
You come anywhere near eggs,

1369
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,093
leap down,

1370
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:41,470
grab the sperm and crawl back in.

1371
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:42,100
Yeah.

1372
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,570
All the guys back then were,

1373
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:47,740
they almost look like they were all gay
maybe at work cause they were all like,

1374
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:48,130
you know,

1375
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:49,390
do they all had body here?

1376
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,860
Which dudes all shave today?

1377
00:36:50,861 --> 00:36:53,140
It's really interesting when
you just see what happened.

1378
00:36:53,141 --> 00:36:53,940
Groom was,

1379
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:57,040
well I think giveaway a lot in this
movie gets lit on fire and falls in the

1380
00:36:57,041 --> 00:36:57,430
water.

1381
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:58,150
Look at that dude.

1382
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,410
I'll study with his shirt off.

1383
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:03,853
Oh

1384
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:05,320
whoa.

1385
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,290
Just jumps in the water.

1386
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,000
Took Rita out.

1387
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:09,203
Damn

1388
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,120
deep.

1389
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:10,810
Deep,

1390
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:11,643
deep.

1391
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:14,780
This is awesome.

1392
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,030
Into the waters of his domain,

1393
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,750
so he just drown and may follow.

1394
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:21,950
He just drowned a bitch.

1395
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:22,401
Yeah,

1396
00:37:22,401 --> 00:37:23,840
I guess he's like drowning her.

1397
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:26,270
I Dunno what's happened during
the middle of a gator roll.

1398
00:37:26,271 --> 00:37:27,530
They're amazing.

1399
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:32,450
Three dimension creature
from the black lagoon.

1400
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:33,560
Oh Man.

1401
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,140
Isn't in the fascinating thing
when you can go back and back in

1402
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:39,450
time like that and see
something and see what,

1403
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:42,770
what media looked like in 1954 oh my God.

1404
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:43,723
I know.

1405
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:46,490
And then that you know that
people would see certain things.

1406
00:37:46,491 --> 00:37:47,630
It'd be so captivated.

1407
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,080
Valid.

1408
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:52,090
We would fucking love that
movie if we lived in 1954 yeah.

1409
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,930
Well actually what do we as adults,

1410
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,130
what would it be so psyched?

1411
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:55,730
I think so.

1412
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:57,500
Because you had never seen shit like that.

1413
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,420
You might even be more impressed.

1414
00:37:59,421 --> 00:37:59,601
Like,

1415
00:37:59,601 --> 00:38:00,530
what the fuck?

1416
00:38:00,531 --> 00:38:01,490
How did they do this?

1417
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,241
But I was thinking like,

1418
00:38:02,241 --> 00:38:03,130
who goes to sales movie?

1419
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:03,983
Would it be kids?

1420
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,270
Because in 1954,

1421
00:38:05,271 --> 00:38:06,680
guys our age are almost dead.

1422
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,353
Yeah,

1423
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:08,901
that's true.

1424
00:38:08,901 --> 00:38:09,920
I had a late thirties.

1425
00:38:09,921 --> 00:38:10,071
Like,

1426
00:38:10,071 --> 00:38:10,580
who are you?

1427
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,510
You're not even alive.

1428
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,373
But they're also,

1429
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:15,440
they're also more like scared of,

1430
00:38:15,441 --> 00:38:16,274
um,

1431
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,350
the unknown of the unknown.

1432
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:21,560
But I think that would be a
thing where they'd be like,

1433
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:21,801
Oh,

1434
00:38:21,801 --> 00:38:22,391
you're not,

1435
00:38:22,391 --> 00:38:23,780
you don't want to bring a
kid do something like this.

1436
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:27,350
This is an adults only kind
of rated r mean Appdex.

1437
00:38:27,351 --> 00:38:30,350
This white woman takes her
to the bottom of the ocean.

1438
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,220
He's scary,

1439
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:31,761
real scary.

1440
00:38:31,761 --> 00:38:32,300
And he's,

1441
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:35,710
you don't take a white bitch into the
bottom of the ocean unless you in either

1442
00:38:35,711 --> 00:38:36,820
killer or fucker.

1443
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:37,180
Yeah.

1444
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,050
He's probably doing about fair.

1445
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:40,360
You're probably going to kill her
unless you can come really quick.

1446
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:41,410
She's going to drown.

1447
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,000
It's rude.

1448
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:43,570
Yeah,

1449
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:44,590
there's definitely,

1450
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:46,150
there's a lot of stuff you
don't want to see in this goal.

1451
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,010
1954.

1452
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,900
The audience wasn't ready.

1453
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:53,630
Do you know the creature was
modeled after the Oscar real?

1454
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:54,464
Yeah.

1455
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:55,630
Yeah.

1456
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:55,781
Well,

1457
00:38:55,781 --> 00:38:58,600
they figured with a fucking
plot like this were a shoe it,

1458
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:01,330
how could we go wrong?

1459
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,890
Guys were dealing with a Gil man.

1460
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,710
He's a monster that kidnaps and then
fucks and we got hot white benches that he

1461
00:39:08,711 --> 00:39:09,461
kidnaps.

1462
00:39:09,461 --> 00:39:11,860
This movie's going to be big water.

1463
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:12,760
He drowns them,

1464
00:39:12,761 --> 00:39:16,840
he rapes them and then he leaves them
back to the surface in real black and

1465
00:39:16,841 --> 00:39:17,300
white.

1466
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,090
Three it's going to be amazing.

1467
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,290
Three d black and white.

1468
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:22,060
That's going to be amazing.

1469
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:22,900
Holy Shit.

1470
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:27,250
There's no better piece of evidence
about how our society has changed.

1471
00:39:27,251 --> 00:39:32,080
I think then watching our old shows and
movies like try to watch father knows

1472
00:39:32,081 --> 00:39:32,914
best.

1473
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,300
It's beautiful.

1474
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:36,840
It's like you're watching
a comedy like you,

1475
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:41,841
you watch father knows best and it's
so awkward and like clunky and fake and

1476
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:49,470
like not in any way resembling
how human beings really behaved.

1477
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,460
It becomes a comedy.

1478
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:51,740
Yeah.

1479
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,540
Yeah.

1480
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,880
Like you may guess it was
supposed to be a comedy back then,

1481
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,520
but it wasn't.

1482
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,321
It wasn't.

1483
00:39:56,321 --> 00:39:56,951
It was a drama,

1484
00:39:56,951 --> 00:39:57,350
comedy,

1485
00:39:57,350 --> 00:39:58,183
drama.

1486
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,530
What would you call it?

1487
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:00,221
It was like a comedy,

1488
00:40:00,221 --> 00:40:00,500
right?

1489
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,333
Yeah.

1490
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:03,160
It's funny for being sucky.

1491
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,350
It's funny for being really stupid.

1492
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,650
Well father knows best and
it was fucking stupid pipe.

1493
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:11,290
It's like the whole
thing is like so weird.

1494
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:11,531
Oh,

1495
00:40:11,531 --> 00:40:12,161
it's crazy.

1496
00:40:12,161 --> 00:40:12,940
Surreal.

1497
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:15,310
If you watch like see if you
could pull up a father knows,

1498
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:19,330
you know it's also really
bad that like shows you like,

1499
00:40:19,331 --> 00:40:20,620
it makes you think about what were,

1500
00:40:20,621 --> 00:40:24,770
what were you thinking when we saw this
and where people impressed are like uh,

1501
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:25,630
music videos.

1502
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:27,610
If you watch old music
videos and you're like,

1503
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,720
Holy Shit,

1504
00:40:28,721 --> 00:40:28,980
this is,

1505
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:29,990
oh yeah,

1506
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,440
but at the time you
know that they're like,

1507
00:40:32,441 --> 00:40:33,274
do you see this guy?

1508
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,750
He can make his face freeze on the screen
and then they'll leave it there for a

1509
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:41,230
minute and a half while some
other shit goes on behind it.

1510
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:45,310
And that was like they were showing off
the technology when they made those,

1511
00:40:45,311 --> 00:40:46,460
but they weren't even like making it.

1512
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:46,811
They were like,

1513
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:49,690
just look at the buttons we
got with this new software.

1514
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,210
Like the videos were just bad,

1515
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,830
new special effects.

1516
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,360
Here's some of black guys never said,

1517
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,620
hey man,

1518
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,620
you check out that contract.

1519
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:58,463
Google video.

1520
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:00,580
No one's ever said it.

1521
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,800
I've never heard say that ever.

1522
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:04,181
Yeah.

1523
00:41:04,181 --> 00:41:06,970
Some of those old videos
were fucking preposterous.

1524
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:07,810
Yeah.

1525
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:08,140
Terry,

1526
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:11,980
you know what I heard the other day for
a long time that I haven't heard in a

1527
00:41:11,981 --> 00:41:12,671
long time.

1528
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:13,750
That really brought me back.

1529
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,000
That I want candy song.

1530
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,860
Really hot bitch.

1531
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,530
What are you laughing about?

1532
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:25,190
You hear that?

1533
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,770
I like a strip club.

1534
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:28,343
No.

1535
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,800
Was that Chippendale's?

1536
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,713
Constantly.

1537
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:31,840
That's a,

1538
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,480
that's a girl song.

1539
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:35,250
Girls singing about a boy.

1540
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,153
Um,

1541
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:41,100
I think I was at a restaurant and
it was playing in the background.

1542
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:43,440
I was like a pizza place or
something and it was like Whoa.

1543
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:44,820
Immediately put you in a good mood.

1544
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:46,050
Well I just always,

1545
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,160
the girl

1546
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:47,993
was the sheriff.

1547
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:49,143
Did you?

1548
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:52,090
Did you have that sound?

1549
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,640
I'll do that stupid shit.

1550
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:55,120
Fuck.

1551
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,650
How old do you think on this?

1552
00:41:56,651 --> 00:41:57,011
Terrible.

1553
00:41:57,011 --> 00:41:57,844
Shut up.

1554
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,170
It's so bad.

1555
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:02,110
Breaking my brain is so god damn bed.

1556
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,180
God.

1557
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:04,301
Well,

1558
00:42:04,301 --> 00:42:05,890
you know it's almost just as bad.

1559
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:06,810
Ah,

1560
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:07,560
yes dear.

1561
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,430
You ever see that Sitcom?

1562
00:42:08,431 --> 00:42:09,264
Yeah.

1563
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:12,390
Might as well be the same fucking show.

1564
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:16,980
There's a lot of sitcoms that are
on even currently that are like,

1565
00:42:16,981 --> 00:42:18,060
Holy Shit.

1566
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:18,901
They've been shown a yes,

1567
00:42:18,901 --> 00:42:19,650
dear marathon,

1568
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:21,270
500 Nickelodeon.

1569
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:22,290
Yeah.

1570
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,610
It's unfucking believable.

1571
00:42:23,611 --> 00:42:24,444
How bad that show.

1572
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,673
Oh,

1573
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,120
it's madness.

1574
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:27,420
Yeah,

1575
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,890
like you're watching madness.

1576
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,350
I always wondered why
isn't he Clark blew a fuse?

1577
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,430
Like what happened?

1578
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:32,821
Yeah,

1579
00:42:32,821 --> 00:42:35,840
I bet it was just working on that shitty
show over and over and over again.

1580
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:38,420
Those goddamn scripts every to it's like,

1581
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:38,851
cool,

1582
00:42:38,851 --> 00:42:39,840
I'll pull a boob.

1583
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,210
I'd been working at the same plant.

1584
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:42,870
Yeah,

1585
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:43,260
I dunno.

1586
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:48,260
There's something w extra bad about
being a comedian and being on an unfunny

1587
00:42:49,621 --> 00:42:50,070
show.

1588
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,320
It's just knowing how bad it is.

1589
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,050
Yeah.

1590
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:53,550
There's something extra bad.

1591
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:54,240
Yeah.

1592
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,170
That's a fucking show.

1593
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:57,150
I was watching on the
family the other day.

1594
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,250
That is the best show.

1595
00:42:59,251 --> 00:43:00,084
So good chicken.

1596
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:01,260
Do you remember how racist he was?

1597
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,313
Look at it.

1598
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:04,850
This works for you and Henry.

1599
00:43:04,851 --> 00:43:05,900
You're trying to find somebody else.

1600
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,880
You don't call that crooked?

1601
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:08,720
No.

1602
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,100
You walking off by number one.

1603
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:11,121
Where does that place?

1604
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:11,954
Henry Jackson.

1605
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,380
It was of a joke.

1606
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:15,320
Why is he number two?

1607
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:16,161
Because me,

1608
00:43:16,161 --> 00:43:16,431
dad,

1609
00:43:16,431 --> 00:43:17,151
they can only be one.

1610
00:43:17,151 --> 00:43:18,170
Number one I want to know,

1611
00:43:18,171 --> 00:43:18,920
be chill.

1612
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:23,050
I like Mae Jemison number two long
before I come along I suppose,

1613
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:27,270
but the Puerto Ricans a number three
then this just showing it that a little

1614
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:27,531
gallery,

1615
00:43:27,531 --> 00:43:28,810
your point of weakness could be fun.

1616
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:31,370
Be Judging your change can be three,

1617
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:33,321
three,

1618
00:43:33,321 --> 00:43:34,154
a three B.

1619
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:38,810
It was the greatest shot.

1620
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:39,741
He couldn't make that show.

1621
00:43:39,741 --> 00:43:40,441
Now I need to get the,

1622
00:43:40,441 --> 00:43:42,230
show me how good it is.

1623
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:42,501
Yeah.

1624
00:43:42,501 --> 00:43:46,640
I wonder if they even censored
the DVDs because I mean he used,

1625
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:48,050
oh he dropped in bombs.

1626
00:43:48,051 --> 00:43:49,350
He called everyone shakes in it.

1627
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:51,350
We've become a bunch of pussies.

1628
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:51,680
Yeah.

1629
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:56,090
We've become super duper sensitive
pussies and you know a lot of people

1630
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:59,760
apologizing for a lot of
shit because of that you'll,

1631
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:01,580
you'll lose out on comedy,

1632
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:02,241
you know,

1633
00:44:02,241 --> 00:44:03,320
because you're not,

1634
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:06,290
you can't tell me those
guys don't still exist.

1635
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:06,840
Oh yeah.

1636
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,070
No,

1637
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:09,200
you can't tell me that
racism doesn't still exist.

1638
00:44:09,201 --> 00:44:09,921
It absolutely does.

1639
00:44:09,921 --> 00:44:13,790
But I think racism in
the context of a show,

1640
00:44:13,791 --> 00:44:15,020
like all in the family,

1641
00:44:15,021 --> 00:44:15,721
the way he's ready,

1642
00:44:15,721 --> 00:44:17,210
I think it helps people.

1643
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,390
I think it helps people relate to it.

1644
00:44:19,391 --> 00:44:23,540
Like how he's such a moron and it
makes you realize he's a fucking idiot.

1645
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:23,840
Yeah.

1646
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:26,340
It makes you relate to how
everybody else sees him.

1647
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:28,280
It's like it's probably
good for the culture.

1648
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:30,170
Absolutely realistic
about a guy like that.

1649
00:44:30,171 --> 00:44:33,330
And you even see in that
character because it's so deep,

1650
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:37,470
you actually see how it's not
the only thing that defines him.

1651
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:42,090
So you still have a soft spot in a way
for this guy who has the detestable

1652
00:44:42,091 --> 00:44:43,530
aspects of his personality.

1653
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:45,210
He also did,

1654
00:44:45,211 --> 00:44:46,890
I mean Carol O'Connor,

1655
00:44:46,891 --> 00:44:49,050
so who to play them did an amazing job.

1656
00:44:49,051 --> 00:44:49,491
A plane.

1657
00:44:49,491 --> 00:44:50,190
My God,

1658
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:53,250
amazing job because he was a guy
that clearly loved his children,

1659
00:44:53,251 --> 00:44:54,510
who wasn't a terrible person.

1660
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:55,020
Right.

1661
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:55,710
You know,

1662
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:59,760
he was tolerant even with meathead
living with him and never got violent or

1663
00:44:59,761 --> 00:45:00,271
anything like that.

1664
00:45:00,271 --> 00:45:01,000
You know what I mean?

1665
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,010
You can think about how a lot of fathers
would have been like way more horror,

1666
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:09,230
but it was like he also was a buffoon
and that buffoonery sorta look,

1667
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:09,810
you go,

1668
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:10,260
oh,

1669
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:11,970
that's why he's racist.

1670
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:16,620
The same reason why he's the butt of all
these jokes cause he's a buffoon and I

1671
00:45:16,621 --> 00:45:17,640
think that's a good thing.

1672
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:18,990
I don't think that's a bad thing at all.

1673
00:45:18,991 --> 00:45:19,351
But you,

1674
00:45:19,351 --> 00:45:19,771
you're right.

1675
00:45:19,771 --> 00:45:19,951
You could.

1676
00:45:19,951 --> 00:45:20,880
We don't have that today.

1677
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:22,910
The thing is when you cut,

1678
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,790
you don't want to carry,

1679
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:25,230
they would censor a character like that.

1680
00:45:25,231 --> 00:45:30,231
Today you're doing a disservice to just
your own honesty about people because

1681
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:32,790
you're not acknowledging that.

1682
00:45:32,791 --> 00:45:33,271
Like you said,

1683
00:45:33,271 --> 00:45:34,140
that person's out there.

1684
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:34,531
Yeah.

1685
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:37,350
It's like how come you can acknowledge
that the murderers are out there?

1686
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:41,130
How can you can acknowledge every week
on CSI that there's a crazy fucking

1687
00:45:41,131 --> 00:45:42,720
serial killer chopping up hookers.

1688
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:45,430
You can do that every week and
nobody has a problem with it.

1689
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:50,190
But if they had one character on TV that
was a racist white guy that was talking

1690
00:45:50,191 --> 00:45:52,800
shit about the chinks in
the specs and it'd be like,

1691
00:45:52,801 --> 00:45:53,880
what the fuck?

1692
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:55,710
Everybody would protest.

1693
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:59,130
People would say they were going to
boycott at Internet marketing campaigns a

1694
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:00,330
stop the hate.

1695
00:46:00,331 --> 00:46:02,610
And when his comedy too far,

1696
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:02,900
well,

1697
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:03,340
you know,

1698
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:06,990
now did you see on the Superbowl
the commercial that that people,

1699
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:11,760
they didn't want it run because of the
white guy do in the Jamaican accident.

1700
00:46:11,761 --> 00:46:12,620
Like that was the guy,

1701
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:17,460
they sent out a press release
about how offensive it was.

1702
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:18,780
And um,

1703
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:19,570
it was,

1704
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:22,260
it was a car commercial where
like the guy in Minnesota,

1705
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:22,891
a white guy,

1706
00:46:22,891 --> 00:46:24,690
he's doing a bad or not even bad,

1707
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:24,890
it,

1708
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:27,420
I think it's pretty
decent Jamaican accent,

1709
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:28,320
uh,

1710
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,041
throughout the commercial.

1711
00:46:29,041 --> 00:46:32,640
It's so crazy that they wanted
an apology and then you have,

1712
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:33,960
uh,

1713
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,010
at another end of that,

1714
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,620
what does it JC penny is trying to get,

1715
00:46:37,621 --> 00:46:38,454
was trying to get,

1716
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:39,293
or Sears,

1717
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:40,320
um,

1718
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,000
has,

1719
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:41,310
uh,

1720
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:45,000
Ellen's generous as a spokeswoman
and then there's protesters.

1721
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:45,690
They're like,

1722
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:46,590
we don't want,

1723
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,500
you just lost a dollar for hiring her.

1724
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:50,530
You know,

1725
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:53,560
they weren't good and we don't
want your flooring dollar.

1726
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:57,270
And they would get more people supporting
them wherever they're going to lose

1727
00:46:57,271 --> 00:47:00,210
for those people that are not going to
get back unless they stand up for it.

1728
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:00,600
Yeah.

1729
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,070
And then talk about a fucking stupid,

1730
00:47:02,071 --> 00:47:03,060
that's what do you watching Brian?

1731
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:03,811
That's the commercial.

1732
00:47:03,811 --> 00:47:04,860
He wasn't just talking about,

1733
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:06,570
oh look how look this is what they,

1734
00:47:06,571 --> 00:47:07,360
these people wanted.

1735
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:07,910
And uh,

1736
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:09,060
this commercial polled

1737
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:10,260
golf,

1738
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,400
then miss the gym.

1739
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:13,013
Giulia,

1740
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,530
turn the frown the other way around.

1741
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:17,910
Hey Dave,

1742
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:18,860
you're from Minnesota,

1743
00:47:18,861 --> 00:47:19,270
right?

1744
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:20,103
Yes.

1745
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:23,010
I 10,000 lakes.

1746
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,210
The gopher state.

1747
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:25,140
So in conclusion,

1748
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,060
things are pretty dismal.

1749
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:27,981
You know what?

1750
00:47:27,981 --> 00:47:30,410
This room needs a smile.

1751
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:32,620
Who want to come with Di traveling

1752
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:36,263
by car.

1753
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:41,243
Why

1754
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:48,270
Dave?

1755
00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:49,560
Really for real.

1756
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:50,423
They pulled that.

1757
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:51,271
No they did not.

1758
00:47:51,271 --> 00:47:51,990
They wanted to,

1759
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:53,560
a group one brought,

1760
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:54,030
they were like,

1761
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:55,470
this is the racist.

1762
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:56,633
Awful.

1763
00:47:56,670 --> 00:47:57,420
Oh my God.

1764
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:58,620
Prejudice commercial.

1765
00:47:58,621 --> 00:47:59,280
My God.

1766
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,190
And you need to pull this shit down.

1767
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:03,053
That's hilarious.

1768
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:04,900
So what was the name of the
group that wanted to pull it?

1769
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:06,810
If you did a Google search for it?

1770
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:07,650
Uh,

1771
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:08,670
the Superbowl,

1772
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,050
Jamaican,

1773
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:11,430
Minnesota and commercial.

1774
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:12,630
Uh,

1775
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:13,310
you'll see.

1776
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:13,500
Yeah,

1777
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,460
it was a whole thing.

1778
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:15,000
And then,

1779
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,230
and then everybody was anticipating
because that new story came out before the

1780
00:48:19,231 --> 00:48:19,650
Superbowl.

1781
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:19,861
Like,

1782
00:48:19,861 --> 00:48:24,861
wait til you see this shit like
protest where they then that aired,

1783
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:26,770
you know like a,

1784
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:27,603
yeah,

1785
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:29,160
that's what we're offended by now.

1786
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:30,060
People are really

1787
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:30,900
so selling.

1788
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:35,160
Meanwhile they were really clever and how
they did that where everything the guy

1789
00:48:35,161 --> 00:48:36,630
says it is very positive.

1790
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:37,770
Yeah.

1791
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:38,670
It's not like,

1792
00:48:38,671 --> 00:48:39,504
you know,

1793
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:40,471
doing a,

1794
00:48:40,471 --> 00:48:45,300
a Jamaican accent but just like bang
it a bunch of bitches and sleeping in a

1795
00:48:45,301 --> 00:48:46,040
closet.

1796
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:46,873
Yeah,

1797
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:47,370
yeah.

1798
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:48,960
Stealing orange juice or something,

1799
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:49,200
you know?

1800
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,010
He was like trying to
make everybody smarter.

1801
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:53,070
I'm a Jamaican pot smoking rapist.

1802
00:48:53,071 --> 00:48:53,904
You guys

1803
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:56,460
all right enough with that.

1804
00:48:56,810 --> 00:48:58,590
People are so fucking sensitive.

1805
00:48:58,680 --> 00:48:59,700
They're so stupid.

1806
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:00,870
Someone,

1807
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:04,950
someone wrote some blog about
what's his face that did the Oscars?

1808
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:05,843
Stephan quo.

1809
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:06,630
Oh yeah.

1810
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:07,710
Apparently said something about,

1811
00:49:07,711 --> 00:49:09,510
nobody can understand sound behind but,

1812
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,460
but no one cares because she's so hot.

1813
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:12,750
It's kind of funny.

1814
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:13,350
You know what I mean?

1815
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:14,490
It's not offensive.

1816
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:14,680
Oh,

1817
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:14,911
come.

1818
00:49:14,911 --> 00:49:18,240
And this fucking chick wrote
this article where it was like,

1819
00:49:18,241 --> 00:49:22,830
so what you're basically saying
is that her opinion is invalid.

1820
00:49:22,831 --> 00:49:27,510
It doesn't matter if she's communicating
because you find her attractive and you

1821
00:49:27,511 --> 00:49:29,130
can't understand it
because she's Hispanic.

1822
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:31,350
Like w w what you're,

1823
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:32,730
it's a comedy joke.

1824
00:49:32,731 --> 00:49:33,421
It's a joke.

1825
00:49:33,421 --> 00:49:37,410
You fuckhead you got
damped supersensitive shit.

1826
00:49:37,411 --> 00:49:37,960
Fuck.

1827
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,880
It's the worst that is ruining,

1828
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,460
that's ruining the fun
and it's ruining life.

1829
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:42,691
And,

1830
00:49:42,691 --> 00:49:43,524
and just,

1831
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:44,210
uh,

1832
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:44,390
it,

1833
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:44,611
it's,

1834
00:49:44,611 --> 00:49:46,690
it's going to ruin
communication between people.

1835
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:50,050
Is that type of reaction
did you see with a,

1836
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,160
like what Espn,

1837
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:51,490
uh,

1838
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:55,840
they issued an apology on behalf
of Brent Musburger for the national

1839
00:49:55,841 --> 00:50:00,010
championship game when he commented on
Aging Mclaren's girlfriend and just like,

1840
00:50:00,011 --> 00:50:00,844
yes.

1841
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,060
And you watch him like he has,

1842
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:03,530
you want him to apologize.

1843
00:50:03,531 --> 00:50:05,080
She said she was pretty,

1844
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,460
like when you put a woman,

1845
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:06,900
uh,

1846
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:07,190
you,

1847
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:08,770
you starting quarterbacks get all the,

1848
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:10,480
like the beautiful ones.

1849
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:14,320
And then I bet there's a lot of young
boys out there in Alabama right now that

1850
00:50:14,321 --> 00:50:16,030
just started throwing the ball around,

1851
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:17,230
just warming their arm up,

1852
00:50:17,231 --> 00:50:17,711
getting ready,

1853
00:50:17,711 --> 00:50:18,030
you know?

1854
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:18,550
Yeah.

1855
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:19,570
What's wrong with that?

1856
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:20,640
It's he,

1857
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:21,130
I mean,

1858
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:26,130
the implication is that she is only with
him because he's who he is and that,

1859
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:31,190
that he only sees in her beauty because
that's all Brent Musburger talked about

1860
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:32,960
was how beautiful she was.

1861
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:38,290
And you know how she's not just a piece
of meat and people wrote articles and

1862
00:50:38,361 --> 00:50:42,560
had their opinions about how
unbelievably offended they were.

1863
00:50:42,561 --> 00:50:43,910
That Brent Musburger was like,

1864
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:44,660
wow,

1865
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:48,830
what a beautiful woman to this obviously
gorgeous woman that is standing there

1866
00:50:48,831 --> 00:50:51,320
that anybody's reaction would be,

1867
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:52,130
wow,

1868
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:53,030
what a beautiful woman.

1869
00:50:53,031 --> 00:50:53,720
She is.

1870
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:54,201
Not like,

1871
00:50:54,201 --> 00:50:54,681
wow,

1872
00:50:54,681 --> 00:50:56,480
I wonder what her thoughts are right now.

1873
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:00,320
It's so hilarious.

1874
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:03,680
People are so silly and
the real problem is,

1875
00:51:03,681 --> 00:51:04,210
and other people,

1876
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:05,090
but listening to them,

1877
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:05,990
that's the real problem.

1878
00:51:05,991 --> 00:51:06,824
Of course,

1879
00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:07,490
you know,

1880
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:09,140
it's a real problem is that they can,

1881
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:12,650
they can protest and they don't get
mocked the way they would in your house,

1882
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:14,180
the way they would in your neighborhood,

1883
00:51:14,181 --> 00:51:15,920
the way they would in a normal,

1884
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:17,210
healthy community.

1885
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:18,470
Someone brought that up.

1886
00:51:18,471 --> 00:51:18,951
He'd be like,

1887
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:20,750
shut him the fuck out of here.

1888
00:51:20,751 --> 00:51:21,830
He crazy asshole.

1889
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:22,693
Right.

1890
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:24,860
But because of the fact that
they know that they can,

1891
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:25,460
you know,

1892
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:28,850
could you imagine if like someone
in your neighborhood was a,

1893
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:33,950
a guy and he had a beautiful wife and you
knew that he was a football player and

1894
00:51:33,951 --> 00:51:36,620
so we were all sitting around and you're
like somewhere guys are warming their

1895
00:51:36,621 --> 00:51:37,041
arms up,

1896
00:51:37,041 --> 00:51:38,060
looking at her like,

1897
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:39,650
can I get to be one of those?

1898
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:40,880
You'd laugh at that guy.

1899
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,033
He's silly.

1900
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:43,710
You know what I mean?

1901
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:44,543
Like

1902
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:48,950
people are actually genuinely
pretending to be upset.

1903
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:49,880
Yeah.

1904
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,020
We can't be actually upset.

1905
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:53,180
You're upset at the world
if you're upset at that,

1906
00:51:53,181 --> 00:51:53,940
you're not really yes.

1907
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:56,490
Because you're really
focusing on something that is,

1908
00:51:56,610 --> 00:51:58,260
it's even less than important.

1909
00:51:58,290 --> 00:51:58,631
Like it,

1910
00:51:58,631 --> 00:52:03,360
it doesn't even belong in that
like circle of conversation.

1911
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:04,470
This is not an issue.

1912
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,060
You're wasting your time.

1913
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:07,110
And we all know it.

1914
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:07,791
That's why we get,

1915
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:08,624
we get upset about it.

1916
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:13,640
By that we know that you're wasting
everybody's time to ask for apologies for

1917
00:52:13,891 --> 00:52:16,110
something that you might
interpret coming out.

1918
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:18,630
Like if it's not even a direct statement.

1919
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:19,853
Yeah.

1920
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:21,113
Uh,

1921
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:21,560
it's,

1922
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:26,560
it's a weird thing that's going on
where we've been around for so long and

1923
00:52:26,851 --> 00:52:29,520
comedy in this offensive comedy
has been around for so long.

1924
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,920
But there's this new thing,

1925
00:52:31,921 --> 00:52:36,300
this righteous indignation that people
were claiming now more than ever where

1926
00:52:36,301 --> 00:52:38,820
they're pretending that there's not a,

1927
00:52:38,821 --> 00:52:43,560
a joking context to a lot of this stuff
that let that joking context doesn't

1928
00:52:43,561 --> 00:52:44,220
even exist.

1929
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:44,710
Yeah,

1930
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:45,241
it's joking.

1931
00:52:45,241 --> 00:52:48,360
Context doesn't exist and they'll
take a joke as a statement.

1932
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:53,510
Did you know that he said he would like
to see the queen getting eaten out by a

1933
00:52:53,911 --> 00:52:54,930
hot 20 year old?

1934
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:57,420
Cause I said that once I
was talking about the queen.

1935
00:52:57,421 --> 00:52:57,871
I was like,

1936
00:52:57,871 --> 00:52:58,101
you know,

1937
00:52:58,101 --> 00:52:59,730
she's probably a nice old lady.

1938
00:52:59,731 --> 00:53:01,860
Well wouldn't it be great
if she was a lesbian?

1939
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:02,813
I mean wouldn't that be like,

1940
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:03,541
cause if you,

1941
00:53:03,541 --> 00:53:04,140
if you know,

1942
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:06,840
if you made now if
someone just look at that,

1943
00:53:06,841 --> 00:53:09,810
oh Joe Rogan was hoping the Queen
get eaten out by hot 20 year old.

1944
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:12,600
You do you have a put that in the
paper in England they would go crazy.

1945
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:13,740
Like what are you saying?

1946
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:14,820
Obviously,

1947
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:16,740
I don't really mean that
these are the jokes,

1948
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:22,030
but t to cut out that aspect
of communication is to
pretend it's like you're

1949
00:53:22,951 --> 00:53:23,784
playing dumb.

1950
00:53:24,090 --> 00:53:24,950
Like you don't think so.

1951
00:53:24,970 --> 00:53:26,140
You might not think it's funny,

1952
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:28,210
but you know the difference
between someone jokes

1953
00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:31,800
around and a very casual joke around,

1954
00:53:31,801 --> 00:53:35,340
by the way about a girl being attractive
and guys are warming up their arms,

1955
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:38,470
throwing the ball around cause they'd
like to have an attractive girlfriend.

1956
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,920
Like are we pretending that we
don't like attractive people?

1957
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:41,461
Exactly.

1958
00:53:41,461 --> 00:53:42,140
Like what did we,

1959
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:43,080
what did we mad at?

1960
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:43,350
Or,

1961
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:45,930
and we're also pretending that like if,

1962
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:51,080
if you're factoring in and attractive
persons attractive attraction level,

1963
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:54,530
then that is a cheap and,

1964
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:56,100
and shortsighted of you.

1965
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:58,080
Like what about the other,

1966
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:58,590
you know,

1967
00:53:58,590 --> 00:53:59,940
factors about this person,

1968
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:00,541
but you're like,

1969
00:54:00,541 --> 00:54:00,840
well,

1970
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:05,040
why are we going to pretend like they're
level of attraction isn't a factor.

1971
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:06,210
It's a real factor.

1972
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,113
It's gonna.

1973
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,840
It's gonna determine a lot of
things in that person's life.

1974
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:10,320
Right.

1975
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:10,621
You know,

1976
00:54:10,621 --> 00:54:13,200
and we're going to just ignore
that because they're attractive.

1977
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:14,010
Yeah.

1978
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:14,370
Yes.

1979
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:15,203
Come on.

1980
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:16,193
So stupid.

1981
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:19,710
Just like ugly people don't have a good,

1982
00:54:19,711 --> 00:54:19,981
you know,

1983
00:54:19,981 --> 00:54:20,970
we can talk about that.

1984
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:21,900
There's real,

1985
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:22,830
it's fucking real.

1986
00:54:22,831 --> 00:54:23,431
It's a shit.

1987
00:54:23,431 --> 00:54:24,940
Roll the dice and you all know it.

1988
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:25,863
Goddammit.

1989
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:27,390
Trent Reznor his wife.

1990
00:54:27,610 --> 00:54:29,220
I just found out about her.

1991
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:29,820
Look at her.

1992
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:30,690
She is the most,

1993
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:33,060
I found out about her
music and then I was like,

1994
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:34,380
well I need to find out who this is.

1995
00:54:34,381 --> 00:54:35,820
I need to stop soccer boy.

1996
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:36,510
Yeah,

1997
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:37,231
I need to stock her.

1998
00:54:37,231 --> 00:54:39,420
And then I found I was
turning this resonance wife,

1999
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:42,990
but her music is like pink Floyd
mixed with electronic music.

2000
00:54:42,991 --> 00:54:43,860
It's really good.

2001
00:54:43,861 --> 00:54:44,460
I haven't read,

2002
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:45,293
what's her name?

2003
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:46,440
Her bed.

2004
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,810
Her bands called how to destroy angels.

2005
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:50,940
They have a new CD that
just came out today.

2006
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:52,140
That sounds like an angry bitch.

2007
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:54,460
And then I tweeted,

2008
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:55,890
I tweeted how much I like it.

2009
00:54:55,950 --> 00:54:57,270
And then all these people are look good.

2010
00:54:57,271 --> 00:55:00,300
She's the new Yoko Ono if
she killed nine snails.

2011
00:55:00,770 --> 00:55:01,603
Huh.

2012
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:03,190
Oh Wow.

2013
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:04,630
This woman who wrote this article,

2014
00:55:04,690 --> 00:55:06,540
I kind of agree with some of
the things she's saying though,

2015
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:07,450
which her name is.

2016
00:55:07,451 --> 00:55:09,250
This is the one was complaining about,

2017
00:55:09,310 --> 00:55:09,590
uh,

2018
00:55:09,590 --> 00:55:14,560
went comedy does not win a free pass
is the name of the article saying Seth

2019
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:15,393
Macfarlane at the Oscars.

2020
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,150
Okay.

2021
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:18,520
Some of what she's saying I agree with,

2022
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:23,620
you know she's saying she's sick of
people saying things that are racist and

2023
00:55:23,621 --> 00:55:28,621
sexist and that someone saying it's just
comedy somehow gives you a free pass.

2024
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:31,030
It doesn't give you a free pass.

2025
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:31,630
I agree.

2026
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:32,463
I agree with that.

2027
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:33,101
But you know,

2028
00:55:33,101 --> 00:55:35,190
it does give you a free
pass if it's funny.

2029
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:35,730
It's funny.

2030
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:36,460
Yeah.

2031
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:36,930
And that's,

2032
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:38,260
that's what she's missing.

2033
00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:42,940
Like if someone says something
fucked up and racist but hilarious.

2034
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:43,300
Yeah,

2035
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:44,140
you can say that.

2036
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:44,920
You can say it,

2037
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:49,080
you can say it as long as I know that
you're just joking and there's this

2038
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,750
certain shit like you'll do like yo
like crack like this fucked up the half

2039
00:55:52,751 --> 00:55:55,780
smile and you'll say something
and I know you're bullshitting.

2040
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:56,111
You're,

2041
00:55:56,111 --> 00:56:00,160
you're like doing a joke to me and I know
you're doing it and I'll laugh my ass

2042
00:56:00,161 --> 00:56:03,220
off because I know you really don't
mean this mean thing that you're saying,

2043
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:06,160
but you'll say it joking and
like just say that smile.

2044
00:56:06,161 --> 00:56:07,570
It's like you can't quite,

2045
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:08,983
it's fun.

2046
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,650
It's a fun thing to do
and it's not reality.

2047
00:56:11,651 --> 00:56:13,480
It's not like a statement on things.

2048
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:18,670
The idea that joking doesn't exist or
the idea that something that is fucking

2049
00:56:18,671 --> 00:56:23,671
hilarious shouldn't be said because it's
also racist or it's also is that's so

2050
00:56:24,761 --> 00:56:25,480
silly.

2051
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:28,210
I mean can I tell you
too that I feel like the,

2052
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:32,800
they're basically our two groups
as far as who gets like your point,

2053
00:56:32,801 --> 00:56:37,801
what you're saying and then who gets
upset by it and it's almost almost split

2054
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:42,820
down the line of intelligent and not so
intelligent that we're as intelligent

2055
00:56:42,821 --> 00:56:43,180
people.

2056
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:46,690
I feel like get what you joking.

2057
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:49,720
They get joking around that
people who are a little bit,

2058
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:50,501
you know,

2059
00:56:50,501 --> 00:56:53,530
and then that breaking it down to
like an Iq level but they're like,

2060
00:56:53,531 --> 00:56:55,000
do you not get this right now?

2061
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:55,751
I agree with you.

2062
00:56:55,751 --> 00:56:56,561
To a certain extent.

2063
00:56:56,561 --> 00:56:59,530
But I also think that there's one other
segment that you have to address and

2064
00:56:59,531 --> 00:57:01,390
that is unhappy people.

2065
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:02,140
That's very true.

2066
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:06,490
There's a lot of smart people that
are fucking miserable and they want to

2067
00:57:06,491 --> 00:57:07,870
complain about anything they can.

2068
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:10,930
And anytime they think they have the
red light or the green light to go,

2069
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:11,771
they will just go,

2070
00:57:11,771 --> 00:57:12,011
right.

2071
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:13,210
The country is shit.

2072
00:57:13,211 --> 00:57:16,690
They can fucking think up because
they've been looking for a green light.

2073
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,240
They've been looking for a chance
to get pissed about something.

2074
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:23,560
And if you say these x words in a row
and they know that this is a green light,

2075
00:57:23,561 --> 00:57:24,580
I'm going after this fuck.

2076
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:25,900
And I just find the angle,

2077
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:30,520
what's the angle to attack him and how
he believes slavery should be back in

2078
00:57:30,521 --> 00:57:31,181
season.

2079
00:57:31,181 --> 00:57:32,500
You believe what?

2080
00:57:32,501 --> 00:57:32,890
This per,

2081
00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:34,590
I cannot leave yet.

2082
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:35,950
I just indignation.

2083
00:57:35,951 --> 00:57:36,521
And you know what?

2084
00:57:36,521 --> 00:57:38,620
You make a good point because the,

2085
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:41,590
that can be either a smart
or a dumb person that,

2086
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:42,191
and they're,

2087
00:57:42,191 --> 00:57:43,720
and they're often smart,

2088
00:57:43,721 --> 00:57:44,440
often smart,

2089
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:45,161
and that when they,

2090
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:46,090
if they do get happy,

2091
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:46,840
um,

2092
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,610
you get to experience like,

2093
00:57:48,611 --> 00:57:49,180
uh,

2094
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:50,260
whether they're smart or dumb,

2095
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:51,580
I totally different person.

2096
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:52,001
Yes.

2097
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:52,390
Yeah,

2098
00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:52,691
yeah,

2099
00:57:52,691 --> 00:57:52,931
yeah,

2100
00:57:52,931 --> 00:57:53,201
yeah.

2101
00:57:53,201 --> 00:57:54,100
You're more joyful.

2102
00:57:54,101 --> 00:57:59,101
And we have another problem with people
that are really smart is that they

2103
00:57:59,111 --> 00:58:01,210
recognize the variables.

2104
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:04,090
They recognize the
consequences of failure.

2105
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:08,380
They recognize the consequences of their
own laziness or whatever it is that's

2106
00:58:08,381 --> 00:58:10,360
kept them from being successful.

2107
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:14,590
They are frustrated by their own inability
to reach their potential in life.

2108
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:17,350
So then when they find a green light,

2109
00:58:17,351 --> 00:58:19,000
like it's Catholic fall and telling jokes,

2110
00:58:19,001 --> 00:58:21,070
the Oscars like they're frustrated.

2111
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:21,371
Right,

2112
00:58:21,371 --> 00:58:21,670
okay.

2113
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:26,670
Already and smart and go find something
to attack when you're really sort of

2114
00:58:27,971 --> 00:58:29,170
projecting some,

2115
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:32,390
some of your internal bullshit on it,

2116
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,010
you know,

2117
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,330
a silly subject.

2118
00:58:34,331 --> 00:58:36,400
Him saying that Salma Hayek is hot,

2119
00:58:36,401 --> 00:58:38,200
so no one cares that
you can understand her.

2120
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:39,250
That's what,

2121
00:58:39,251 --> 00:58:41,230
that's what's horrible about that.

2122
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:42,520
Have you ever heard her talk,

2123
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:45,820
Jesus fucking Christ and we pretended
that she's easy to understand.

2124
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,620
Are you really going to
pretend that that's a good,

2125
00:58:47,890 --> 00:58:50,140
I don't know what the dual Mr Jaws.

2126
00:58:50,170 --> 00:58:50,560
Yeah.

2127
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,450
She's fucking really hard to understand.

2128
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:53,050
Yeah,

2129
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:53,530
of course.

2130
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,090
And she's also really hot as fuck.

2131
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:55,480
Yeah.

2132
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:56,440
I've met her in real life.

2133
00:58:56,441 --> 00:58:57,101
She's beautiful.

2134
00:58:57,101 --> 00:58:57,491
She's very,

2135
00:58:57,491 --> 00:58:58,000
very,

2136
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,590
she was on that and here
comes the boom movie.

2137
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:00,641
She's beautiful.

2138
00:59:00,641 --> 00:59:01,331
She's smoking,

2139
00:59:01,331 --> 00:59:01,931
but why would it,

2140
00:59:01,931 --> 00:59:04,930
why would she be upset that
she's hard to understand really?

2141
00:59:05,530 --> 00:59:07,180
If it didn't make sense,

2142
00:59:07,181 --> 00:59:08,380
it wouldn't be funny.

2143
00:59:08,470 --> 00:59:09,303
For the record,

2144
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:11,650
I'd like to fill her up and seal her shut.

2145
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:12,311
Yes.

2146
00:59:12,311 --> 00:59:12,760
On the height.

2147
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:13,090
Yeah.

2148
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:16,750
I would like to fill her up with so much
come that she could float in the ocean.

2149
00:59:18,970 --> 00:59:19,803
She would just,

2150
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:21,400
she would be,

2151
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:22,260
she's so buoyant.

2152
00:59:22,261 --> 00:59:22,951
They don't even know why.

2153
00:59:22,951 --> 00:59:23,784
I would like her to have

2154
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:28,550
so much common hurt that it's dripping
out of her nose and she uses it as

2155
00:59:28,551 --> 00:59:29,384
seasoning on her talk.

2156
00:59:30,010 --> 00:59:30,521
And you know what?

2157
00:59:30,521 --> 00:59:32,590
This dummy that wrote
this needs to understand,

2158
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:33,970
here's the big part.

2159
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:35,860
If it didn't make sense,

2160
00:59:35,890 --> 00:59:37,090
it wouldn't be funny.

2161
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:37,960
Okay.

2162
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:41,410
If you try to say that about Jennifer
Aniston and nobody understands her,

2163
00:59:41,470 --> 00:59:43,150
but no one cares because she's so hot,

2164
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:43,960
people would be like,

2165
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:44,410
what?

2166
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:45,100
Yeah.

2167
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:46,150
What are you talking about?

2168
00:59:46,270 --> 00:59:46,691
Jennifer?

2169
00:59:46,691 --> 00:59:48,250
Aniston is very easy to understand,

2170
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:49,300
right?

2171
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:51,640
So why are you pretending?

2172
00:59:51,641 --> 00:59:53,170
Why are you saying that's hurtful?

2173
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,300
That's crazy talk.

2174
00:59:56,050 --> 01:00:01,050
And you're talking about the
Oscars silly expression of,

2175
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:02,080
you know,

2176
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:07,080
real rewarding people that are making
movies and all you have to do this,

2177
01:00:08,561 --> 01:00:09,101
this guy,

2178
01:00:09,101 --> 01:00:10,540
he's just trying to get a couple of he,

2179
01:00:10,541 --> 01:00:12,250
he's in haws in between.

2180
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:12,851
You know,

2181
01:00:12,851 --> 01:00:15,730
he's got a few moments to make
a little bit of an impact.

2182
01:00:15,731 --> 01:00:15,970
Yeah.

2183
01:00:15,970 --> 01:00:16,151
Hey,

2184
01:00:16,151 --> 01:00:18,700
let's say Sammo high is hot
and fucking again our standard,

2185
01:00:18,701 --> 01:00:19,240
but who cares?

2186
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:19,451
Okay,

2187
01:00:19,451 --> 01:00:19,661
good,

2188
01:00:19,661 --> 01:00:19,841
good,

2189
01:00:19,841 --> 01:00:20,230
good.

2190
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:23,300
And then like your co constructing
a little comedy routine.

2191
01:00:23,301 --> 01:00:23,920
Yeah.

2192
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,830
You mentioned have a high pressure that
hosting Gigis well you know what should

2193
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:30,100
be high pressure writing
this stupid blog shit out.

2194
01:00:30,101 --> 01:00:34,180
She's had a thousand people on
reddit review this blog and then,

2195
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:35,170
and then,

2196
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:36,340
then decide,

2197
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:37,920
you know how it gets raided.

2198
01:00:38,290 --> 01:00:40,780
We like red stars over the top of it.

2199
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:41,351
Yeah.

2200
01:00:41,351 --> 01:00:42,170
And then you,

2201
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:45,130
then this company decides whether or
not they want to fucking print your dumb

2202
01:00:45,131 --> 01:00:45,690
shit.

2203
01:00:45,690 --> 01:00:46,270
Jesus.

2204
01:00:46,270 --> 01:00:49,780
But she's right about that
comedian shouldn't get a free pass.

2205
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:54,100
They shouldn't like their shit and
it's just racist and it's not funny.

2206
01:00:54,130 --> 01:00:54,541
And you,

2207
01:00:54,541 --> 01:00:55,780
you hear it and it's not,

2208
01:00:55,781 --> 01:00:56,050
it's,

2209
01:00:56,050 --> 01:00:56,351
you know,

2210
01:00:56,351 --> 01:00:57,400
someone crossed the line.

2211
01:00:57,850 --> 01:01:00,400
And a lot of times that's an competence.

2212
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:04,060
A lot of times it's guys who
think that they're being edgy,

2213
01:01:04,061 --> 01:01:04,900
so that's funny.

2214
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:06,170
But they don't really
know how to be funny.

2215
01:01:06,171 --> 01:01:09,160
And like we've all worked with
guys there are shockingly bad.

2216
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:10,173
Oh yeah.

2217
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:10,581
You know,

2218
01:01:10,581 --> 01:01:11,500
and that,

2219
01:01:11,950 --> 01:01:12,930
that sort of calm.

2220
01:01:13,030 --> 01:01:16,600
Sometimes people say things and they
just say things because they're stuck on

2221
01:01:16,601 --> 01:01:17,980
stage and they start talking.

2222
01:01:17,981 --> 01:01:19,060
I didn't even know what
the fuck they're saying,

2223
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:20,530
but they're trying to be edgy.

2224
01:01:20,590 --> 01:01:20,770
Right.

2225
01:01:20,770 --> 01:01:23,420
So then they say something
like really fucked up and race.

2226
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:24,890
Have you ever seen that happen?

2227
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:25,911
Yeah,

2228
01:01:25,911 --> 01:01:26,670
I was.

2229
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:26,891
Yeah,

2230
01:01:26,891 --> 01:01:28,720
though that feeling when you're panicking.

2231
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:30,760
But this obviously this is,

2232
01:01:30,761 --> 01:01:32,680
she's talking about a monologue,

2233
01:01:33,010 --> 01:01:34,120
but I've seen it with,

2234
01:01:34,121 --> 01:01:36,700
I'm very like a guy trying
to make a very like,

2235
01:01:36,701 --> 01:01:36,830
uh,

2236
01:01:36,830 --> 01:01:41,380
like trying to be edgy in a sex joke
and then just goes through it and you're

2237
01:01:41,381 --> 01:01:41,650
like,

2238
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:42,640
Holy Shit.

2239
01:01:42,641 --> 01:01:45,610
Like you sound like you're going to
murder and kill and rape bitches tonight.

2240
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:48,420
Like you could tell he just didn't know.

2241
01:01:48,450 --> 01:01:48,611
You know,

2242
01:01:48,611 --> 01:01:49,660
he just wanted to run through it.

2243
01:01:49,690 --> 01:01:49,930
Yeah.

2244
01:01:49,930 --> 01:01:50,321
Crazy.

2245
01:01:50,321 --> 01:01:51,154
It sounded and you're like,

2246
01:01:51,590 --> 01:01:52,900
it does not sound good man.

2247
01:01:52,930 --> 01:01:53,141
There's,

2248
01:01:53,141 --> 01:01:54,040
there's no joke there.

2249
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:55,173
Yeah.

2250
01:01:55,310 --> 01:01:58,820
There's certain certain things that
people say on stage and the way they,

2251
01:01:58,821 --> 01:01:59,510
Sam,

2252
01:01:59,510 --> 01:02:00,100
one person,

2253
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:01,910
you could say it and
it's really hilarious.

2254
01:02:02,170 --> 01:02:04,730
And then like half the
Shit Joey Diaz says,

2255
01:02:04,970 --> 01:02:08,210
if it wasn't someone as
lovable as Joey Diaz,

2256
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:08,691
you'd be like,

2257
01:02:08,691 --> 01:02:09,710
get this guy off.

2258
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:14,860
If he was like an awkward white guy that
was kind of shifting or if you just saw

2259
01:02:15,111 --> 01:02:15,350
his,

2260
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:15,591
his,

2261
01:02:15,591 --> 01:02:15,980
uh,

2262
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:16,813
what he says written.

2263
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:17,300
Yes.

2264
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:17,810
You'd be like,

2265
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:18,643
oh man.

2266
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:19,191
Yeah,

2267
01:02:19,191 --> 01:02:20,030
you did.

2268
01:02:20,330 --> 01:02:20,851
You got to be,

2269
01:02:20,851 --> 01:02:21,990
while you'll never see that.

2270
01:02:21,991 --> 01:02:23,230
You don't have to worry
about that happening.

2271
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:24,870
That's not written anywhere.

2272
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:28,201
That act,

2273
01:02:28,201 --> 01:02:29,100
they written down.

2274
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:29,881
They got mad at me.

2275
01:02:29,881 --> 01:02:30,840
Once we're having a notebook,

2276
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,180
what are you going to walk around
with this fucking law book?

2277
01:02:33,270 --> 01:02:34,890
Really like you want it?

2278
01:02:34,891 --> 01:02:35,724
He's fucking,

2279
01:02:35,870 --> 01:02:36,420
what are those?

2280
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:37,253
What's that?

2281
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:39,960
What's that place that they all go to?

2282
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:44,160
What's the alternative room used to be?

2283
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:46,680
What are you one of
those fucking UCB almost

2284
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:49,980
notebook.

2285
01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:53,310
You know what the Fuck I'm saying?

2286
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:54,840
You're letting everybody
know you got your notebook.

2287
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:58,440
It's my fucking nervous
I can put to go on stage.

2288
01:02:58,470 --> 01:02:59,670
I don't know what to say to that.

2289
01:02:59,671 --> 01:03:03,900
I'm letting everybody know that I take
notes like no fucking does that even mean

2290
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,033
he's so great.

2291
01:03:05,130 --> 01:03:10,130
I've seen him a go on stage and just
really just talk shit on people in the

2292
01:03:10,831 --> 01:03:12,780
audience for like 15 minutes.

2293
01:03:12,810 --> 01:03:14,910
Just talk things out and
that there was nothing.

2294
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:18,420
He was really just in the moment and
it was like the funniest shit I've ever

2295
01:03:18,421 --> 01:03:18,870
seen.

2296
01:03:18,870 --> 01:03:19,171
Yeah,

2297
01:03:19,171 --> 01:03:19,640
he you,

2298
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:23,980
you can't like personality and like
what is funny and what's not fun.

2299
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:25,920
It's also so subjective.

2300
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:28,830
So someone saying a comedian
getting a free pass.

2301
01:03:28,831 --> 01:03:29,460
Well,

2302
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:31,350
it might not be good for you.

2303
01:03:31,530 --> 01:03:32,220
Okay.

2304
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:35,370
But you got to understand that
that's that person doing this thing.

2305
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:37,770
It's like the same as
someone singing a song.

2306
01:03:38,130 --> 01:03:39,750
You're just not thinking
about it that way.

2307
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:41,640
You know when someone is singing a song,

2308
01:03:41,641 --> 01:03:43,470
they're creating a piece of
instrument entertainment.

2309
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:44,820
When someone's doing a joke,

2310
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:46,540
they're creating a piece
of entertainment too,

2311
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:49,680
but it's a completely different
process and sometimes it doesn't work.

2312
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:52,290
It's not like someone said
that like you asked them,

2313
01:03:52,470 --> 01:03:53,430
Hey Thomson girl,

2314
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,800
what do you think about
white girls with cornrows?

2315
01:03:56,190 --> 01:03:56,761
And you know,

2316
01:03:56,761 --> 01:03:57,660
and you just go,

2317
01:03:57,661 --> 01:03:57,961
well,

2318
01:03:57,961 --> 01:03:58,370
you know,

2319
01:03:58,370 --> 01:04:00,240
I fucking think there are
a bunch of crazy bitches.

2320
01:04:00,241 --> 01:04:01,020
They'll stab you.

2321
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:02,880
Like you're not being
interviewed for the news.

2322
01:04:02,881 --> 01:04:03,210
Right.

2323
01:04:03,210 --> 01:04:04,290
You're telling jokes,

2324
01:04:04,410 --> 01:04:05,243
of course.

2325
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,530
And that that's a real like,

2326
01:04:07,531 --> 01:04:07,801
to me,

2327
01:04:07,801 --> 01:04:12,801
that's a real social problem that people
need to be called on because I think

2328
01:04:13,770 --> 01:04:18,690
when people think that they can just
get away with being twatty like that and

2329
01:04:18,691 --> 01:04:23,691
everybody gives him that political correct
free pass and puts logic out the door

2330
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,410
and doesn't call him on it going,

2331
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:25,580
yeah,

2332
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:26,730
that's not what's going on here.

2333
01:04:26,731 --> 01:04:27,190
This is,

2334
01:04:27,190 --> 01:04:27,340
well,

2335
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:29,670
you shut the fuck up if I
was in your living room,

2336
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:30,840
can you imagine if you're in your,

2337
01:04:30,841 --> 01:04:35,841
in your house and you and a fucking
Seth macfarlane are sitting there joking

2338
01:04:35,851 --> 01:04:39,810
around and he says that about Salma
Hayek and you guys both start laughing.

2339
01:04:39,811 --> 01:04:40,760
He like a couple of,

2340
01:04:41,430 --> 01:04:41,761
you know,

2341
01:04:41,761 --> 01:04:42,870
a couple guys would,

2342
01:04:42,990 --> 01:04:45,690
and then this woman is also
there and she's on the couch,

2343
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:46,740
just the three of you.

2344
01:04:46,830 --> 01:04:47,970
And she starts complaining,

2345
01:04:48,090 --> 01:04:48,750
Oh yeah,

2346
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:49,171
you'd be like,

2347
01:04:49,171 --> 01:04:49,920
what?

2348
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:50,753
And then and,

2349
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:52,940
and you would have a crazy,

2350
01:04:53,510 --> 01:04:56,580
a con argument about they're
your size and then you'd be like,

2351
01:04:56,581 --> 01:04:58,800
we're never hanging out
with that person ever again.

2352
01:04:58,950 --> 01:04:59,281
Well,

2353
01:04:59,281 --> 01:05:04,110
it's the most ironic thing because
lefties and progressive people are always

2354
01:05:04,170 --> 01:05:06,300
espousing freedom of speech.

2355
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:07,680
The First Amendment,

2356
01:05:07,681 --> 01:05:08,431
freedom of the press,

2357
01:05:08,431 --> 01:05:11,700
they're always talking about how
important it is to have a free internet.

2358
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:17,120
But meanwhile they're also like the
first people willing to get at someone

2359
01:05:17,911 --> 01:05:22,590
expressing themselves in a manner that
they find amusing or that they find,

2360
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:23,280
you know,

2361
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,140
they find shocking but funny.

2362
01:05:25,230 --> 01:05:27,300
You should have free speech
up until it bothers me.

2363
01:05:27,301 --> 01:05:27,751
Yes,

2364
01:05:27,751 --> 01:05:28,584
exactly.

2365
01:05:28,590 --> 01:05:31,050
Free speech up until you
cross the conservative line.

2366
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:34,380
And then when I feel like you've crossed
into some area where I can make fun of

2367
01:05:34,381 --> 01:05:34,720
you.

2368
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:35,261
Do you ever get,

2369
01:05:35,261 --> 01:05:35,770
um,

2370
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:38,680
have you gotten mail
hate mail about jokes?

2371
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:39,220
You know,

2372
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:39,910
not really.

2373
01:05:39,910 --> 01:05:40,151
Yeah.

2374
01:05:40,151 --> 01:05:40,781
I mean sure.

2375
01:05:40,781 --> 01:05:42,750
There's been certain things that
people have been upset about it.

2376
01:05:42,751 --> 01:05:43,210
Yeah.

2377
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:45,100
I always feel like going like,

2378
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:47,020
like do you remember this
thing that you're up,

2379
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:52,080
this was on a standup comedy
show or this was a comedy?

2380
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:54,860
Well you had a lot of people
mad at you about that bike joke.

2381
01:05:54,861 --> 01:05:55,280
Right?

2382
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:56,120
So many.

2383
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:01,160
You looked like a little like
bothered by it at one point in time.

2384
01:06:01,161 --> 01:06:03,440
Like I didn't know what to kill you.

2385
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:05,280
What weather?

2386
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:09,650
Like it was a normal reaction like cause
it was the first thing that had gotten

2387
01:06:09,651 --> 01:06:11,750
any like real exposure

2388
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:15,830
and everybody wants to kill you.

2389
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:18,530
The big thing that it
got was it got the um,

2390
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:24,560
he got the Huffington post
home comedy page for a day.

2391
01:06:24,890 --> 01:06:29,180
So like it was the first thing on
huffpost comedy because it was using,

2392
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:32,840
being used to promote your
special season of actually,

2393
01:06:32,870 --> 01:06:33,081
well,

2394
01:06:33,081 --> 01:06:38,081
but my special in was that was
the season debut of the series.

2395
01:06:38,210 --> 01:06:41,030
So it was hey the series
is back for season,

2396
01:06:41,031 --> 01:06:41,864
whatever,

2397
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:43,970
here's a clip from the first episode,

2398
01:06:44,030 --> 01:06:44,690
you know,

2399
01:06:44,690 --> 01:06:45,830
so it was that kind of thing,

2400
01:06:45,831 --> 01:06:47,120
like a big promo thing.

2401
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:48,230
What's the series?

2402
01:06:48,290 --> 01:06:49,880
It was comedy central presents,

2403
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:50,900
which is right.

2404
01:06:51,230 --> 01:06:52,011
So they were going to air,

2405
01:06:52,011 --> 01:06:52,340
you know,

2406
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:53,030
15 of them.

2407
01:06:53,030 --> 01:06:54,170
How many did they do last year?

2408
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:55,700
They did about,

2409
01:06:55,701 --> 01:06:56,780
I think around 16.

2410
01:06:57,050 --> 01:06:57,530
That's great.

2411
01:06:57,530 --> 01:06:57,830
Yeah.

2412
01:06:57,830 --> 01:06:58,940
That's called the half hour now.

2413
01:06:58,941 --> 01:07:02,990
They changed the name of it and
then they just shot the new ones.

2414
01:07:03,610 --> 01:07:04,240
Uh,

2415
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:05,060
yes.

2416
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:06,940
This past weekend in New York did,

2417
01:07:06,950 --> 01:07:08,310
you should try to get one of those Brian.

2418
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:09,313
Actually I should.

2419
01:07:09,950 --> 01:07:11,470
There should be a goal when
I'm talking about buddy.

2420
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:13,850
It should be your goal.

2421
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:15,890
Your goal should be to
put one of those together.

2422
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:16,640
You can do that.

2423
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,080
Hey get manager first or something.

2424
01:07:18,081 --> 01:07:20,090
Like get a notebook,

2425
01:07:20,650 --> 01:07:21,440
get a notebook.

2426
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:22,610
Don't worry about that dude.

2427
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:23,720
You don't need a manager first.

2428
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:24,940
You need to just,

2429
01:07:25,020 --> 01:07:25,620
just

2430
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:26,970
do a lot of writing.

2431
01:07:27,070 --> 01:07:28,710
We'll a lot of writing get on stage.

2432
01:07:28,950 --> 01:07:29,101
You know,

2433
01:07:29,101 --> 01:07:30,330
you got some really killer jokes.

2434
01:07:30,340 --> 01:07:32,100
Did you have some funny shit?

2435
01:07:32,101 --> 01:07:34,920
You have some good ideas
like you could really like,

2436
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:37,410
you can really like put down
a special if you want it to,

2437
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:39,000
if you really wanted to
dedicate yourself to it.

2438
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:40,170
Yeah.

2439
01:07:40,170 --> 01:07:41,160
Work up to that for sure.

2440
01:07:41,161 --> 01:07:41,580
Man.

2441
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:45,390
Have you ever been so drunk that you can
even like you had to just get off the

2442
01:07:45,391 --> 01:07:45,990
stage?

2443
01:07:45,990 --> 01:07:46,530
No,

2444
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:46,810
never.

2445
01:07:46,810 --> 01:07:47,440
Never got drunk.

2446
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:47,671
No,

2447
01:07:47,671 --> 01:07:47,851
no,

2448
01:07:47,851 --> 01:07:48,140
no.

2449
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:48,420
I've,

2450
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:48,931
I've been,

2451
01:07:48,931 --> 01:07:49,764
um,

2452
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:50,971
I've really,

2453
01:07:50,971 --> 01:07:55,971
the most I've ever had is like a buzz
from drinking where I recognized that it

2454
01:07:56,341 --> 01:08:00,050
was throwing off my timing
and stuff like and then um,

2455
01:08:00,330 --> 01:08:01,410
I just couldn't think as quick.

2456
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:02,130
That's not good.

2457
01:08:02,130 --> 01:08:03,450
So I I I personally,

2458
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:04,170
I mean I know it,

2459
01:08:04,170 --> 01:08:05,040
everyone's different with it.

2460
01:08:05,250 --> 01:08:09,630
I don't drink until I'm done performing
cause I will fuck me up sometimes.

2461
01:08:09,631 --> 01:08:10,020
I do.

2462
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:12,000
Sometimes I have a couple of
drinks and you pull it off.

2463
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:12,271
Yeah.

2464
01:08:12,271 --> 01:08:12,671
But I,

2465
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:15,240
I prefer honestly I prefer my sets,

2466
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:15,710
uh,

2467
01:08:15,710 --> 01:08:17,720
when I'm just a little bit high

2468
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:20,233
or sober.

2469
01:08:20,570 --> 01:08:21,020
Yeah.

2470
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:21,920
Those are my best sets.

2471
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:22,250
Yeah,

2472
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:23,083
me too.

2473
01:08:23,330 --> 01:08:26,240
But every now and then
I'll go up lit and crush.

2474
01:08:26,510 --> 01:08:27,950
Especially like at the Ice House,

2475
01:08:27,951 --> 01:08:28,970
Jesus Christ.

2476
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:30,990
Cause it's like home base.

2477
01:08:31,370 --> 01:08:34,610
I'll get a couple of Jack Daniels and
go up to the ice house because the ice

2478
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:36,740
house is like so positive.

2479
01:08:36,770 --> 01:08:37,100
Great.

2480
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:38,000
Like everyone,

2481
01:08:38,001 --> 01:08:39,200
there is all hugs.

2482
01:08:39,201 --> 01:08:40,700
The waiters are cool,

2483
01:08:40,701 --> 01:08:42,200
the bartenders are cool,

2484
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:43,640
the waitresses are cool,

2485
01:08:43,641 --> 01:08:44,960
the managers are cool.

2486
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:46,670
It's like when you go to the ice house,

2487
01:08:46,671 --> 01:08:47,001
it's like,

2488
01:08:47,001 --> 01:08:47,960
that's like a love.

2489
01:08:47,961 --> 01:08:49,530
That's like set a family environment.

2490
01:08:49,630 --> 01:08:50,900
When we do as Wednesday nights there,

2491
01:08:51,050 --> 01:08:52,250
we'll probably do one next week too.

2492
01:08:52,251 --> 01:08:52,581
By the way,

2493
01:08:52,581 --> 01:08:53,414
folks.

2494
01:08:53,510 --> 01:08:56,840
We do those Wednesday nights and it's
packed on a Wednesday night at 10.

2495
01:08:56,841 --> 01:08:58,100
It's like you could do anything there.

2496
01:08:58,100 --> 01:08:59,720
So those are my get hammered from.

2497
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:01,310
I could get a little fucked up.

2498
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:03,440
That crowds shut there Friday.

2499
01:09:03,441 --> 01:09:03,960
By the way.

2500
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:06,610
Do you wear at the little mouse who?

2501
01:09:06,611 --> 01:09:06,980
Yeah.

2502
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:09,350
Who either with I believe,

2503
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:11,113
I can't remember now.

2504
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:12,201
I don't have to look at my phone.

2505
01:09:12,201 --> 01:09:13,100
Harmful advertise.

2506
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:15,950
What time is your show?

2507
01:09:15,951 --> 01:09:17,420
That's at 10 o'clock ice house,

2508
01:09:17,421 --> 01:09:19,000
comedy.com desk squad show.

2509
01:09:19,090 --> 01:09:21,830
We have a very odd podcast on,

2510
01:09:21,831 --> 01:09:22,400
um,

2511
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:22,820
on,

2512
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:23,653
um,

2513
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:27,800
on Friday with a doctor Amit Goswami.

2514
01:09:28,250 --> 01:09:29,630
It's a theoretical physicist.

2515
01:09:30,230 --> 01:09:30,680
Wow.

2516
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:31,550
Particle physicists.

2517
01:09:31,551 --> 01:09:32,360
Guys,

2518
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:33,193
what's he going to talk about?

2519
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:34,760
Theoretical physicists,

2520
01:09:35,290 --> 01:09:38,850
like they write a book or like is it's
going to talk about the nature of matter.

2521
01:09:38,851 --> 01:09:40,100
He's going to talk about string theory.

2522
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:44,030
He's going to talk about how the fucking
world is really constructed inside of

2523
01:09:44,031 --> 01:09:44,661
every atom.

2524
01:09:44,661 --> 01:09:46,370
It's just empty space.

2525
01:09:46,790 --> 01:09:47,690
How this,

2526
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:52,840
this idea of strings
vibrating that control and,

2527
01:09:53,061 --> 01:09:54,260
and create all matter.

2528
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:57,680
It's going to be a total mind fuck
because he's like super legit.

2529
01:09:58,170 --> 01:09:58,371
He's,

2530
01:09:58,371 --> 01:09:58,731
you know,

2531
01:09:58,731 --> 01:10:01,850
he's like legit as those
quantum scientists go,

2532
01:10:01,851 --> 01:10:03,920
those quantum guys are so strange.

2533
01:10:04,370 --> 01:10:08,180
It's so hard to understand because
everything they're doing like is,

2534
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:10,670
is all this alien mathematical language.

2535
01:10:10,671 --> 01:10:12,380
Like you see them writing it out and in,

2536
01:10:12,381 --> 01:10:16,340
in that alien mathematical language as
they're writing down all those fucking

2537
01:10:16,341 --> 01:10:18,350
symbols and how that Einstein,

2538
01:10:18,351 --> 01:10:18,910
yeah.

2539
01:10:18,910 --> 01:10:19,490
You know,

2540
01:10:19,490 --> 01:10:20,323
fucking,

2541
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:23,150
what's that movie with Matt Damon and uh,

2542
01:10:23,210 --> 01:10:24,043
Oh yeah.

2543
01:10:24,490 --> 01:10:25,340
What was that movie?

2544
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:29,653
A bunch of numbers.

2545
01:10:30,290 --> 01:10:30,810
Um,

2546
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:31,401
goodwill hunting.

2547
01:10:31,401 --> 01:10:31,971
Good will hunting.

2548
01:10:31,971 --> 01:10:32,211
Yeah.

2549
01:10:32,211 --> 01:10:34,820
When he's writing all that stuff on the
board and you don't know if it's right,

2550
01:10:34,850 --> 01:10:35,600
you know,

2551
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:38,420
you don't know if that shit's
fucking no idea what all that is.

2552
01:10:38,421 --> 01:10:42,410
He might as well be right in nature
and hieroglyphs shit for mathematics.

2553
01:10:42,411 --> 01:10:43,500
It's complex my flags.

2554
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:44,930
But when he's writing that,

2555
01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:45,171
I'm like,

2556
01:10:45,171 --> 01:10:46,370
these guys are writing that shit.

2557
01:10:46,371 --> 01:10:47,920
Like I've seen them like on notes,

2558
01:10:47,930 --> 01:10:50,870
like they'll have an inspiration
for the way and equation.

2559
01:10:50,871 --> 01:10:53,020
It's supposed to be interacting
with the environment and like

2560
01:10:54,590 --> 01:10:55,060
my brain,

2561
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:59,390
just like the real problem with
didn't dealing with those guys.

2562
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:00,480
It's like you're,

2563
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:01,480
even when you're,

2564
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:04,130
you're asking questions about
how they came to the conclusions,

2565
01:11:04,131 --> 01:11:07,580
like how they understand these things
and where were the ideas of string theory

2566
01:11:07,581 --> 01:11:08,151
come from?

2567
01:11:08,151 --> 01:11:10,010
It's like you can't even measure it.

2568
01:11:10,011 --> 01:11:10,380
Like they,

2569
01:11:10,380 --> 01:11:10,971
they're just,

2570
01:11:10,971 --> 01:11:15,480
they're talking about something that
they say and like number form and it'll

2571
01:11:15,490 --> 01:11:17,320
show you like pate but
you'll never get it.

2572
01:11:17,410 --> 01:11:17,710
No,

2573
01:11:17,710 --> 01:11:18,340
you're going to be like,

2574
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:18,641
oh,

2575
01:11:18,641 --> 01:11:19,121
okay.

2576
01:11:19,121 --> 01:11:20,050
Like you'll try it again.

2577
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:24,920
They spray pixie dust and
then say Alica Zam and

2578
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:25,900
babies are born.

2579
01:11:25,930 --> 01:11:28,930
I'm pretty sure I wouldn't get it
because I don't get Algebra one.

2580
01:11:30,070 --> 01:11:33,580
I don't think I would get the advanced
shit with it that I don't even,

2581
01:11:33,610 --> 01:11:37,090
I can't understand the beginning of
what they're trying to even explain.

2582
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:42,150
I think some people just don't
have the capacity or the ability,

2583
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:43,000
you know,

2584
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,410
I think it's like almost anything.

2585
01:11:44,411 --> 01:11:46,570
If you have an interest
in it and you pursue it,

2586
01:11:46,610 --> 01:11:46,840
yeah,

2587
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:47,673
you're good at it.

2588
01:11:47,830 --> 01:11:52,830
And I think mathematics is probably real
similar to whether it's literature or

2589
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:54,490
even athletics is like,

2590
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:55,930
what do you focus your energy on?

2591
01:11:55,931 --> 01:11:57,310
You focus your energy on this.

2592
01:11:57,640 --> 01:11:58,930
You're going to figure out how to do it.

2593
01:11:58,960 --> 01:11:59,351
If it's,

2594
01:11:59,351 --> 01:12:01,150
if it's interesting to you and you,

2595
01:12:01,151 --> 01:12:02,920
I mean you might not be the
best in the world at it,

2596
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:04,780
but if you put your focus on it,

2597
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:06,820
you're going to be able to
figure out how to do it.

2598
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:07,420
That's true.

2599
01:12:07,420 --> 01:12:08,253
Almost anything,

2600
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:08,891
almost anything.

2601
01:12:08,891 --> 01:12:10,780
But it's like what entices you?

2602
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:11,431
Does it do you?

2603
01:12:11,431 --> 01:12:11,610
Are you,

2604
01:12:11,610 --> 01:12:12,160
are you like,

2605
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:12,461
Ooh,

2606
01:12:12,461 --> 01:12:13,210
math,

2607
01:12:13,210 --> 01:12:14,043
Ooh,

2608
01:12:14,050 --> 01:12:14,321
no,

2609
01:12:14,321 --> 01:12:15,400
you're not with you.

2610
01:12:15,401 --> 01:12:15,700
It's like,

2611
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:15,971
aw,

2612
01:12:15,971 --> 01:12:17,470
stage time when we could do a joke.

2613
01:12:17,590 --> 01:12:17,950
Yeah,

2614
01:12:17,950 --> 01:12:18,783
I'm going to kill.

2615
01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:20,450
That's like that's,

2616
01:12:20,490 --> 01:12:21,870
that's what entices you.

2617
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:24,340
What's attractive to
you is what you pursue.

2618
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:27,700
What's attracted to you or
attractive to you stand up comedy.

2619
01:12:27,850 --> 01:12:31,450
But if you were one of those wacky dudes
like that Russian guy who solved this

2620
01:12:31,451 --> 01:12:31,901
prize,

2621
01:12:31,901 --> 01:12:33,580
that we're going to give
them $1 million prize.

2622
01:12:33,940 --> 01:12:35,500
The guy who said he didn't
even want the money.

2623
01:12:35,890 --> 01:12:37,510
He's so fucking crazy.

2624
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:39,850
This dude is just up there in Siberia,

2625
01:12:39,940 --> 01:12:44,290
right and shit down on paper and he solves
some crazy mathematical equation that

2626
01:12:44,291 --> 01:12:45,124
they had been trying to,

2627
01:12:45,190 --> 01:12:47,500
I should pull up the actual
information so I don't,

2628
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:49,360
it doesn't sound like I'm
talking out of my ass,

2629
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:50,470
but um,

2630
01:12:50,470 --> 01:12:50,920
he,

2631
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:52,290
he Russian,

2632
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:53,020
let me pull this up.

2633
01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:53,650
Russian song.

2634
01:12:53,650 --> 01:12:56,500
I'm going to just Google
Russian scientists.

2635
01:12:56,710 --> 01:12:59,470
Come dog wins math prize.

2636
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:03,100
It doesn't want it.

2637
01:13:05,890 --> 01:13:06,760
Let's see if that works.

2638
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:09,520
And notice that I didn't use bing.

2639
01:13:10,570 --> 01:13:12,190
I used fucking Google.

2640
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:12,850
Okay.

2641
01:13:12,850 --> 01:13:13,900
Cause these new commercials,

2642
01:13:13,930 --> 01:13:14,100
right.

2643
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:15,150
You should try bing.

2644
01:13:15,510 --> 01:13:20,380
Bing is actually better than
Google surprise being so crazy.

2645
01:13:20,710 --> 01:13:23,760
I like when a search engine
is a good God damn time.

2646
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:24,430
You know,

2647
01:13:24,430 --> 01:13:25,320
I tell you one thing though,

2648
01:13:25,321 --> 01:13:25,930
if you Google,

2649
01:13:25,930 --> 01:13:28,140
we had this thing on
muffs said the other day.

2650
01:13:28,141 --> 01:13:29,520
If you Google that word,

2651
01:13:29,550 --> 01:13:30,383
boobs,

2652
01:13:30,730 --> 01:13:31,800
a safe serve,

2653
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:33,540
safe search off.

2654
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:35,070
You don't get any tits.

2655
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:37,560
But if you go to Yahoo and do boobs,

2656
01:13:37,590 --> 01:13:38,400
you get tits.

2657
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,230
But which one you don't Google.

2658
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:40,800
Really?

2659
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:41,620
Yeah.

2660
01:13:41,620 --> 01:13:42,800
Google's trying to hide the heads.

2661
01:13:43,330 --> 01:13:43,680
Sorry.

2662
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:44,340
I understand.

2663
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:45,270
Try and make that paper.

2664
01:13:46,290 --> 01:13:47,130
This is the dude.

2665
01:13:47,370 --> 01:13:47,910
Um,

2666
01:13:47,910 --> 01:13:48,460
he,

2667
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:48,830
uh,

2668
01:13:48,830 --> 01:13:49,040
he's a

2669
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:51,080
Russian scientists from Saint Petersburg.

2670
01:13:51,081 --> 01:13:53,570
His name is Gregory Bill Man.

2671
01:13:54,230 --> 01:13:59,230
He's a 40 year old man and he won the
fields medal often described as mass

2672
01:13:59,331 --> 01:14:03,110
equivalent to the Nobel prize for a
breakthrough in the study of shapes that

2673
01:14:03,111 --> 01:14:08,111
experts say might help scientists figure
out the shape of the universe and super

2674
01:14:08,541 --> 01:14:09,920
offended by the way you said his name,

2675
01:14:09,921 --> 01:14:14,600
with that accurate Gregory
bureau men to really offensive.

2676
01:14:14,630 --> 01:14:15,150
John [inaudible],

2677
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:18,620
president of the International Mathematics
Union said that he had urged Perlman

2678
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:19,730
per p,

2679
01:14:19,730 --> 01:14:20,000
p.

2680
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,360
P.

2681
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:23,360
E.

2682
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:23,360
R.

2683
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:23,360
E.

2684
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:23,360
L.

2685
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:23,360
M.

2686
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:23,360
A.

2687
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:23,450
N.

2688
01:14:23,450 --> 01:14:24,320
So I don't know what that is.

2689
01:14:24,370 --> 01:14:24,790
Oh Man.

2690
01:14:24,790 --> 01:14:27,100
Pirlo Pearlman Pearlman.

2691
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:28,400
Anyway,

2692
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:29,233
homeboy,

2693
01:14:29,570 --> 01:14:31,700
he urged homeboy to accept the metal,

2694
01:14:31,850 --> 01:14:35,810
but he said he felt isolated from the
mathematics community and does not want to

2695
01:14:35,811 --> 01:14:37,250
be seen as a figurehead.

2696
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:38,690
Wow.

2697
01:14:38,690 --> 01:14:39,890
He just didn't want the money.

2698
01:14:39,891 --> 01:14:41,990
He passed on $1 million money.

2699
01:14:42,230 --> 01:14:43,280
A million dollar prize.

2700
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:44,310
Million Dollars.

2701
01:14:44,390 --> 01:14:45,223
Yep.

2702
01:14:45,230 --> 01:14:49,280
Besides shunning the award
for his work in top topology.

2703
01:14:49,490 --> 01:14:53,990
He also seems uninteresting according
to colleagues in a separate wouldn't

2704
01:14:53,991 --> 01:14:54,980
billion dollar prize.

2705
01:14:54,981 --> 01:14:55,814
He could win.

2706
01:14:56,420 --> 01:15:01,420
Providing the Poincare
conjecture a theorem about
the nature of multidimensional

2707
01:15:01,761 --> 01:15:02,594
space.

2708
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:03,733
Whoa,

2709
01:15:04,780 --> 01:15:05,613
whoa indeed.

2710
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:06,613
Whoa.

2711
01:15:06,710 --> 01:15:06,891
Yeah,

2712
01:15:06,891 --> 01:15:07,690
he's too smart.

2713
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:08,000
Yeah.

2714
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:12,800
That's a dude that's too smart and
doesn't understand what $2 billion can get

2715
01:15:12,801 --> 01:15:13,180
you.

2716
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:15,200
Cause he can get you a lot of cool shit.

2717
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:16,093
Yeah.

2718
01:15:16,530 --> 01:15:16,670
Oh,

2719
01:15:16,670 --> 01:15:17,750
you're going to have to do,

2720
01:15:17,810 --> 01:15:20,790
one of the things you could do is move
from Siberia with your million dollars.

2721
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:21,411
Yeah.

2722
01:15:21,411 --> 01:15:23,000
You gotta be a really crazy

2723
01:15:23,090 --> 01:15:24,940
fuck to pass on 1 million bucks pocket.

2724
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:28,760
But you probably also have to be a really
crazy fuck to be able to think in such

2725
01:15:28,761 --> 01:15:29,930
a spectacular way.

2726
01:15:30,550 --> 01:15:32,030
It's like the fact that this guy,

2727
01:15:32,450 --> 01:15:37,450
I mean it's not that this
guy wasn't successful because
he's studied mathematics

2728
01:15:38,931 --> 01:15:39,411
only.

2729
01:15:39,411 --> 01:15:41,150
He put all his focus on mathematics.

2730
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:44,150
But once he got really good at that,

2731
01:15:44,151 --> 01:15:47,030
well then he was able to
capitalize on is excellence.

2732
01:15:47,430 --> 01:15:47,850
No,

2733
01:15:47,850 --> 01:15:48,171
no,

2734
01:15:48,171 --> 01:15:48,321
it's,

2735
01:15:48,321 --> 01:15:49,760
they offered him money and he said,

2736
01:15:49,790 --> 01:15:53,050
I don't want to go back to the shock.

2737
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:55,460
And the things like [inaudible] papers.

2738
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:59,540
I just realized too that I was talking
about people's intelligence earlier in

2739
01:15:59,541 --> 01:16:02,240
this podcast and that if that guy met me,

2740
01:16:02,241 --> 01:16:02,721
he'd be like,

2741
01:16:02,721 --> 01:16:03,471
are you the dumbest?

2742
01:16:03,471 --> 01:16:03,590
Yeah.

2743
01:16:03,590 --> 01:16:04,423
Personally,

2744
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:12,390
I've never spoken to somebody
as stupid as you told me again.

2745
01:16:12,990 --> 01:16:13,261
Well,

2746
01:16:13,261 --> 01:16:14,940
I wonder what he would be like socially.

2747
01:16:15,030 --> 01:16:16,560
I wonder what's probably a little awkward.

2748
01:16:16,790 --> 01:16:17,623
I guess

2749
01:16:18,890 --> 01:16:19,723
maybe

2750
01:16:22,410 --> 01:16:26,760
they figured out sociology and he
figured out the interaction between human

2751
01:16:26,761 --> 01:16:27,270
beings.

2752
01:16:27,270 --> 01:16:29,790
Then he becomes the coolest
fucking guy in the world.

2753
01:16:29,791 --> 01:16:30,624
If he's that guy,

2754
01:16:30,690 --> 01:16:31,051
that guy,

2755
01:16:31,051 --> 01:16:34,380
he takes the two months and
we all know that that guy,

2756
01:16:34,381 --> 01:16:36,660
that guy takes the 2 million
definitely goes pimping.

2757
01:16:36,690 --> 01:16:37,920
You should double up on that shit.

2758
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:38,851
You know what?

2759
01:16:38,851 --> 01:16:41,880
Someone just called somebody
that I thought it was an
awesome fucking expression

2760
01:16:41,881 --> 01:16:42,780
to call him a suitcase.

2761
01:16:42,781 --> 01:16:43,320
Pimp.

2762
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:44,250
Suitcase pimps.

2763
01:16:44,930 --> 01:16:45,601
I've never heard of that.

2764
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:46,200
I like that.

2765
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:47,610
I have heard it many times,

2766
01:16:47,611 --> 01:16:49,030
but I hadn't heard it a while.

2767
01:16:49,070 --> 01:16:50,070
A suitcase pimp.

2768
01:16:50,420 --> 01:16:50,761
What's up?

2769
01:16:50,761 --> 01:16:51,594
Suitcase pimp.

2770
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:53,610
It's a suitcase.

2771
01:16:53,611 --> 01:16:54,150
Pimps,

2772
01:16:54,150 --> 01:16:55,050
but it's not a,

2773
01:16:55,051 --> 01:16:55,820
it's not a

2774
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:56,690
positive term.

2775
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:59,750
A suitcase pimp is like a hustler,

2776
01:17:00,020 --> 01:17:00,261
you know?

2777
01:17:00,261 --> 01:17:02,090
It's like he's never
got his shit together.

2778
01:17:02,091 --> 01:17:04,130
He's always like living out of a suitcase.

2779
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:07,550
Somebody said some shit that was so
cool to me that I just didn't get it.

2780
01:17:07,580 --> 01:17:10,160
You know when it's like two
bits much cooler than you.

2781
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:12,880
Somebody yelled that shit at
me in Cleveland like I am.

2782
01:17:12,881 --> 01:17:14,270
So they calm me,

2783
01:17:14,271 --> 01:17:14,630
daisy,

2784
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:15,463
and I was like,

2785
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:17,511
cool.

2786
01:17:17,511 --> 01:17:18,890
I just don't know what the fuck you mean,

2787
01:17:18,891 --> 01:17:19,340
man.

2788
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:21,320
In the porn world,

2789
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:23,450
I use that term suitcase pimp.

2790
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:24,051
Oh really?

2791
01:17:24,051 --> 01:17:24,470
Yeah.

2792
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:25,580
In the porn world,

2793
01:17:25,610 --> 01:17:29,750
a suitcase pimp is the unemployed
boyfriend of the porn star.

2794
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:30,613
Oh,

2795
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:31,730
that's a suitcase pen.

2796
01:17:31,731 --> 01:17:34,070
That's all over that industry support.

2797
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:35,270
You've got to have support in that.

2798
01:17:35,271 --> 01:17:37,790
The craziest thing that those guys,

2799
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:39,020
it's always those guys.

2800
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:39,330
Yeah.

2801
01:17:39,330 --> 01:17:40,163
You know,

2802
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:41,890
it's always a,

2803
01:17:41,930 --> 01:17:42,591
you got to get paid,

2804
01:17:42,591 --> 01:17:43,550
but it's strippers as well,

2805
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:47,000
like a lot of strippers and
especially like girls at work.

2806
01:17:47,001 --> 01:17:47,721
It really nasty,

2807
01:17:47,721 --> 01:17:48,391
but he's this and that.

2808
01:17:48,391 --> 01:17:49,340
You don't feel good about it.

2809
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:50,280
Right.

2810
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:55,010
They need a man and a man waiting for
them when they get home to cuddle with and

2811
01:17:55,011 --> 01:17:55,844
snuggle,

2812
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:56,760
trying to get out.

2813
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:58,160
The memories of all those boners

2814
01:18:01,670 --> 01:18:04,580
and it's always a guy that's
a loser because I mean,

2815
01:18:04,581 --> 01:18:06,170
you know a lot of guys
out there right now,

2816
01:18:06,171 --> 01:18:07,190
it's tripper girlfriends going,

2817
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:08,190
fuck you should.

2818
01:18:08,470 --> 01:18:09,260
Yeah.

2819
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:09,891
But it's true.

2820
01:18:09,891 --> 01:18:13,370
If you're at home and you don't
pay the bills and you don't,

2821
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:13,841
you know,

2822
01:18:13,841 --> 01:18:15,050
you don't contribute to the household.

2823
01:18:15,051 --> 01:18:18,950
You're unemployed and you're girls out
there sticking her pussy and guys faces.

2824
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:21,950
There's a reason why that's
not the conventional setup.

2825
01:18:22,070 --> 01:18:23,090
It's cause you're number one bro.

2826
01:18:24,230 --> 01:18:25,040
That's fine.

2827
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:26,980
Basically the most
awesome guy ever either,

2828
01:18:26,990 --> 01:18:27,231
bro.

2829
01:18:27,231 --> 01:18:27,441
Yes,

2830
01:18:27,441 --> 01:18:28,274
Bro.

2831
01:18:28,310 --> 01:18:30,740
And your band is awesome too.

2832
01:18:31,610 --> 01:18:32,443
And uh,

2833
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:35,150
that Barb wire tat is
looking fucking rat bro.

2834
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:37,940
Does anybody do barbwire anymore?

2835
01:18:37,941 --> 01:18:38,810
I wonder if someone does it.

2836
01:18:38,811 --> 01:18:40,610
Ironically it's gotta be,

2837
01:18:40,611 --> 01:18:41,330
but the thing is,

2838
01:18:41,330 --> 01:18:42,163
it's ironic,

2839
01:18:42,650 --> 01:18:43,240
but you gotta be,

2840
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:46,280
you gotta be rolling with a really a
crew that really knows you to get your

2841
01:18:46,540 --> 01:18:47,373
ironic,

2842
01:18:49,090 --> 01:18:50,560
Ari has keep on trucking.

2843
01:18:50,590 --> 01:18:51,760
Tattoo does ride.

2844
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:53,811
That's,

2845
01:18:53,811 --> 01:18:54,621
that's ironic.

2846
01:18:54,621 --> 01:18:57,250
And I think everyone gets
that campaign has one too.

2847
01:18:57,630 --> 01:18:58,463
The silly one.

2848
01:18:59,220 --> 01:19:00,180
I forget what it is though,

2849
01:19:00,310 --> 01:19:03,240
on just like side or is tat
somebody find out suitcase?

2850
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:04,591
Yeah.

2851
01:19:04,591 --> 01:19:05,460
He's got a funny one.

2852
01:19:06,820 --> 01:19:07,653
Waterfalls.

2853
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:08,371
Barb wire.

2854
01:19:08,371 --> 01:19:09,204
Come on.

2855
01:19:09,270 --> 01:19:10,410
You can't do that shit anymore,

2856
01:19:10,411 --> 01:19:11,244
right?

2857
01:19:11,770 --> 01:19:13,320
Do Girls still get tramp stamps?

2858
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:14,160
I think so.

2859
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:16,200
How many girls have gotten just a target?

2860
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:19,140
Just put it an actual target aim here.

2861
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:19,501
Yeah.

2862
01:19:19,501 --> 01:19:21,690
It's just like concentric rings.

2863
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:22,590
Bullseye.

2864
01:19:22,770 --> 01:19:24,850
There's some freaky fucking ones,

2865
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:25,390
uh,

2866
01:19:25,390 --> 01:19:27,060
around pussies on the Internet.

2867
01:19:27,061 --> 01:19:27,271
Right.

2868
01:19:27,271 --> 01:19:28,021
If you seen some of them,

2869
01:19:28,021 --> 01:19:28,410
we were like,

2870
01:19:28,410 --> 01:19:28,711
oh,

2871
01:19:28,711 --> 01:19:28,980
Mike,

2872
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:33,120
I guess a demon's mouth that is
around her box and you're like,

2873
01:19:33,150 --> 01:19:36,260
you really thought that that
was going to be a good movie?

2874
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:37,130
I think we'll,

2875
01:19:37,130 --> 01:19:41,540
I think that cat butthole belly
button tattoo on is the grossest one.

2876
01:19:41,830 --> 01:19:45,500
It's just once but whole
on your fucking tummy.

2877
01:19:47,690 --> 01:19:48,523
Yeah.

2878
01:19:48,650 --> 01:19:49,970
Mine would look really bad.

2879
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:51,090
It's all here eating,

2880
01:19:51,140 --> 01:19:52,220
letting it all the time.

2881
01:19:52,310 --> 01:19:52,900
Yeah.

2882
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:53,860
You Have Lynn,

2883
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:55,400
I think the other day,

2884
01:19:55,430 --> 01:19:59,810
like a bug crowd in my belly button and
then got squished when I was sleeping.

2885
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:00,730
Really?

2886
01:20:00,730 --> 01:20:02,810
Like put my finger in there
and this thing came out.

2887
01:20:02,811 --> 01:20:04,970
It looked like it like a squished bug.

2888
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,580
Really big one now.

2889
01:20:06,620 --> 01:20:07,680
Like a called it.

2890
01:20:07,770 --> 01:20:08,170
Oh.

2891
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:08,341
Oh,

2892
01:20:08,341 --> 01:20:08,611
okay.

2893
01:20:08,611 --> 01:20:08,761
Well,

2894
01:20:08,761 --> 01:20:09,960
sometimes it looks like spiders.

2895
01:20:09,961 --> 01:20:11,880
When I pull out the lint and
there's all these hairs in them,

2896
01:20:11,881 --> 01:20:12,540
I'm like,

2897
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:12,691
Oh,

2898
01:20:12,691 --> 01:20:14,190
is that a 70 legs spider?

2899
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:16,290
And then I realize that
it's just a ball end.

2900
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:17,153
But yeah,

2901
01:20:17,420 --> 01:20:19,730
this girl got diarrhea
tattooed on her back.

2902
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:20,593
Come on.

2903
01:20:20,610 --> 01:20:21,443
Yeah,

2904
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:23,273
like

2905
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:25,110
the word diarrhea.

2906
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:26,160
Diarrhea.

2907
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:26,710
I guess

2908
01:20:26,710 --> 01:20:28,460
it's for dudes are trying
to fuck her on the butt.

2909
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:29,120
She's like,

2910
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:31,450
I just want to steer you away right away.

2911
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:33,190
That's going to go poorly.

2912
01:20:34,210 --> 01:20:34,391
Yeah,

2913
01:20:34,391 --> 01:20:34,841
there's a,

2914
01:20:34,841 --> 01:20:39,841
if you look on Google images under a
tramp stamps something one girl has like a

2915
01:20:40,031 --> 01:20:43,870
whole Bible passage written on
her lower back up to her ass.

2916
01:20:44,110 --> 01:20:47,350
Is that the last shit you want to be
reading when you're banging a hot chick

2917
01:20:47,351 --> 01:20:48,184
doggy style?

2918
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:52,020
Cause their ass looks tremendous
too and is a bible verse.

2919
01:20:52,650 --> 01:20:54,840
It's a giant literary tattoo.

2920
01:20:55,390 --> 01:20:56,830
But maybe it's really like,

2921
01:20:56,831 --> 01:20:57,011
Hey,

2922
01:20:57,011 --> 01:20:58,600
I want you to come right here in a second,

2923
01:20:58,601 --> 01:21:00,230
but it just written
really fast Corinthians.

2924
01:21:00,550 --> 01:21:01,270
No,

2925
01:21:01,270 --> 01:21:01,750
this is,

2926
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:02,620
this is what it says.

2927
01:21:02,621 --> 01:21:03,040
This is,

2928
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:04,750
this bitch is so crazy.

2929
01:21:06,110 --> 01:21:07,240
Love is patient.

2930
01:21:07,241 --> 01:21:08,380
Love is kind.

2931
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:10,180
It does not envy.

2932
01:21:10,810 --> 01:21:11,643
Love.

2933
01:21:12,010 --> 01:21:14,140
This is all written on her ass.

2934
01:21:15,340 --> 01:21:17,710
Love is never boastful,

2935
01:21:18,070 --> 01:21:20,770
not conceited nor rude.

2936
01:21:21,310 --> 01:21:22,960
It's hard to cause the curve of her ass.

2937
01:21:23,950 --> 01:21:26,290
Something self seeking

2938
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:28,960
commonly,

2939
01:21:29,230 --> 01:21:31,330
commonly not commonly are angered,

2940
01:21:31,390 --> 01:21:32,223
argued,

2941
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:33,093
argued.

2942
01:21:33,670 --> 01:21:35,110
It keeps no secrets,

2943
01:21:35,170 --> 01:21:35,351
blah,

2944
01:21:35,351 --> 01:21:35,471
blah,

2945
01:21:35,471 --> 01:21:36,130
blah.

2946
01:21:36,130 --> 01:21:40,180
It does to delight in evil but
rejoices and I can't read it.

2947
01:21:40,750 --> 01:21:41,051
Blah Blah,

2948
01:21:41,051 --> 01:21:41,884
blah,

2949
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:43,240
protects,

2950
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:44,441
trusts,

2951
01:21:44,441 --> 01:21:46,480
hopes and preserves.

2952
01:21:47,260 --> 01:21:49,060
There is never a blah,

2953
01:21:49,061 --> 01:21:49,211
blah,

2954
01:21:49,211 --> 01:21:49,481
blah,

2955
01:21:49,481 --> 01:21:50,590
something face.

2956
01:21:51,090 --> 01:21:54,040
There is no limit to its faith.

2957
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:54,950
If you could open it,

2958
01:21:54,950 --> 01:21:56,130
this is all in her ass.

2959
01:21:56,131 --> 01:21:58,830
If you can't translate it
just said raped by father.

2960
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:00,780
Keeps going dude.

2961
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:02,550
There is this honor as faith.

2962
01:22:02,610 --> 01:22:03,031
Yes,

2963
01:22:03,031 --> 01:22:04,080
this is all show you.

2964
01:22:04,650 --> 01:22:06,270
But the greatest of them all is love.

2965
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:06,660
Look at that.

2966
01:22:06,660 --> 01:22:08,070
Oh my God.

2967
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:11,130
Like she like wrote,

2968
01:22:11,250 --> 01:22:11,830
I mean it's a pair.

2969
01:22:11,830 --> 01:22:13,500
I think I would lose my erection show.

2970
01:22:13,501 --> 01:22:14,820
Did you see this woman in Columbus?

2971
01:22:14,821 --> 01:22:18,370
The one that has all our tattoos
including Thomson [inaudible] mine,

2972
01:22:19,010 --> 01:22:19,531
but I know her.

2973
01:22:19,531 --> 01:22:20,364
She's awesome.

2974

Yeah.

2978
01:22:22,630 --> 01:22:23,850
That's dumb.

2979
01:22:23,910 --> 01:22:24,391

Did you sign it?

2983
01:22:27,290 --> 01:22:27,660
No.

2984
01:22:27,660 --> 01:22:27,811
No.

2985
01:22:27,811 --> 01:22:30,210
I didn't sign it cause
she didn't ask me to.

2986
01:22:30,211 --> 01:22:30,570
But uh,

2987
01:22:30,570 --> 01:22:32,250

I want a cone of good one.

3051
01:23:52,950 --> 01:23:54,700

01:23:55,300 --> 01:23:56,133

3053
01:23:58,480 --> 01:23:59,100

3054
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:03,330
Delicious cones with the upper
level that is like styrofoam,

3055
01:24:03,331 --> 01:24:06,270

3058
01:24:12,030 --> 01:24:13,680
like writing us phase two.

3059
01:24:13,860 --> 01:24:18,420
He just uses face to draw and you see
what it says under his and I can you read

3060
01:24:18,421 --> 01:24:22,290
what pissed off those things on his eye
under resign or those are tattoos too.

3061
01:24:22,350 --> 01:24:23,390
Oh my God.

3062
01:24:23,780 --> 01:24:24,870
It looks like it's under his,

3063
01:24:24,871 --> 01:24:26,040
I says something.

3064
01:24:26,041 --> 01:24:27,990
What the fuck Bobby or some shit.

3065
01:24:27,991 --> 01:24:28,824
What does that say?

3066
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:30,353
I see,

3067
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:31,790
what does it say?

3068
01:24:31,790 --> 01:24:33,170
1000 vague.

3069
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:34,100
I don't know.

3070
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:37,070
It's hard to say 10 times
10 with the s on the amp.

3071
01:24:37,071 --> 01:24:37,904
So yeah.

3072
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:39,350
And on the other side he has,

3073
01:24:39,351 --> 01:24:41,590
it looks like a dove or something
like that in the Honda's.

3074
01:24:41,770 --> 01:24:41,921
Yeah.

3075
01:24:41,921 --> 01:24:44,450
That that dude is probably irrational.

3076
01:24:44,690 --> 01:24:45,523
Gucci.

3077
01:24:47,260 --> 01:24:47,721
Yeah.

3078

This is music.

3079
01:24:48,501 --> 01:24:48,711
Like,

3080
01:24:48,711 --> 01:24:49,550

3081
01:24:49,551 --> 01:24:49,821

3087
01:24:51,741 --> 01:24:52,191
Gucci Man.

3088
01:24:52,191 --> 01:24:52,701
He's got some,

3089
01:24:52,701 --> 01:24:53,720

3096
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:58,033
Hmm.

3097

Can we listen to a
little bit of the future?

3098
01:24:59,861 --> 01:25:00,694

3101
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:04,133
Yeah.

3102
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:06,100
Does Gucci Mane Independent?

3103
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:08,020
Is he out there working for the man?

3104
01:25:08,650 --> 01:25:09,101
What does he have?

3105
01:25:09,101 --> 01:25:09,540
So many?

3106
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:11,610
He's got a verse here

and you can go pick up a CD.

3111
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:25,130
Yeah.

3112
01:25:25,130 --> 01:25:26,660
There's no tower records anymore.

3113
01:25:26,790 --> 01:25:27,450
No.

3114

He's got better shit.

3144
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:06,681
He's got another,

3145
01:26:06,681 --> 01:26:08,060
he's know for as big as hit.

3146
01:26:08,630 --> 01:26:09,463
Let's do,

3147
01:26:09,890 --> 01:26:10,320
yeah,

3148
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:10,730
yeah,

3149
01:26:10,730 --> 01:26:11,390
yeah.

3150
01:26:11,390 --> 01:26:12,230
You should get it in another,

3151
01:26:12,470 --> 01:26:13,250
that's the sample.

3152
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:14,570
But the fact that he's capable of that,

3153
01:26:15,570 --> 01:26:16,490
he's mad hood man.

3154
01:26:16,491 --> 01:26:17,570
He's got to make it for the streets.

3155
01:26:17,571 --> 01:26:18,111
You know what I'm saying?

3156
01:26:18,111 --> 01:26:18,621
Bad Hood.

3157
01:26:18,621 --> 01:26:19,670
Is that a mad hood song?

3158
01:26:19,820 --> 01:26:21,040
I think definitely that.

3159
01:26:21,100 --> 01:26:24,470
That sounds like some shit you would hear
Bubba and ATL if you were bowling on,

3160
01:26:24,471 --> 01:26:29,120
it sounds like you'd locked
him in a garage with a
hundred cars running and made

3161
01:26:29,121 --> 01:26:31,220
a breathe the fumes for a year.

3162
01:26:31,910 --> 01:26:32,630
Definitely.

3163
01:26:32,630 --> 01:26:33,860
And then you brought him out.

3164
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:35,030
Barely alive.

3165
01:26:37,910 --> 01:26:38,743
This is a little,

3166
01:26:42,410 --> 01:26:43,410
this is terrible to,

3167
01:26:43,750 --> 01:26:44,220
okay.

3168
01:26:44,220 --> 01:26:44,511
Okay.

3169
01:26:44,511 --> 01:26:44,990
Okay.

3170
01:26:44,990 --> 01:26:47,270
I don't want to get to
the little Gucci Man.

3171
01:26:47,630 --> 01:26:48,660
Pull up Gucci Mane.

3172
01:26:48,670 --> 01:26:49,503
His greatest hit.

3173
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:53,720
Try to find groups you means greatest
basely sorted by view count and that was,

3174
01:26:53,870 --> 01:26:56,270
oh well then do a search for it and yeah,

3175
01:26:56,271 --> 01:26:58,610
he's got to have a bigger
hit than that for sure.

3176
01:26:58,611 --> 01:27:00,170
You're defending it.

3177
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:02,480
I want you to get a good sample of Gucci.

3178
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:03,373
Here's a good,

3179
01:27:03,410 --> 01:27:04,243
okay.

3180
01:27:04,940 --> 01:27:05,331
No,

3181
01:27:05,331 --> 01:27:07,040
this is not going to be key chain as fuck.

3182
01:27:07,041 --> 01:27:08,300
It's going to put something else on.

3183
01:27:08,410 --> 01:27:10,340
Some buttons going to
put Rebecca Black Friday.

3184
01:27:10,450 --> 01:27:11,283
No.

3185
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:15,913
Uh,

3186
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:17,111
that chick hurt.

3187
01:27:17,111 --> 01:27:19,390
Her deal was they gave
her a bunch of money.

3188
01:27:19,450 --> 01:27:19,811
Remember that?

3189
01:27:19,811 --> 01:27:19,920
Okay.

3190
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:20,590
Becca black.

3191
01:27:20,590 --> 01:27:20,721
No,

3192
01:27:20,721 --> 01:27:20,810
no,

3193
01:27:20,810 --> 01:27:21,041
no.

3194
01:27:21,041 --> 01:27:22,330
I just heard creation right.

3195
01:27:22,331 --> 01:27:22,690
Then

3196
01:27:22,690 --> 01:27:24,280
how do you even know who that is?

3197
01:27:24,310 --> 01:27:25,143
It was a big deal.

3198
01:27:25,150 --> 01:27:25,841
She got like a,

3199
01:27:25,841 --> 01:27:27,620
I feel like I know you and
then I feel like a dome.

3200
01:27:29,940 --> 01:27:30,110
Oh,

3201
01:27:30,110 --> 01:27:31,640
like a million dollar advance,

3202
01:27:31,670 --> 01:27:35,240
which was not as common now for
an unsafe like unknown artist.

3203
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:37,310
And then that album sell well at all.

3204
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:37,821
Really?

3205
01:27:37,821 --> 01:27:38,654
When was this?

3206
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:40,040
I think within like the last year.

3207
01:27:40,330 --> 01:27:41,163
Huh?

3208
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:44,240
I don't know anybody today and I'm just,

3209
01:27:44,241 --> 01:27:45,110
so I'm out of the loop.

3210
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:46,260
I'm pretty out of it.

3211
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:51,440
I know stuff that like that because it's
in the news and I know I'm mostly the

3212
01:27:51,571 --> 01:27:52,500
music I grew up on.

3213
01:27:52,530 --> 01:27:54,870
I'm not aware of a lot of
the new Shit Gucci Mane.

3214
01:27:54,871 --> 01:27:56,940
I know because you know like a son to me.

3215
01:27:56,941 --> 01:27:57,774
But

3216
01:27:58,740 --> 01:28:02,240
there's so much music that
was been hin been made.

3217
01:28:02,350 --> 01:28:06,530
And when you think about the fact
that from 1960 whatever to today,

3218
01:28:06,930 --> 01:28:08,090
you know you want to go crazy,

3219
01:28:08,091 --> 01:28:09,310
you want to go Robert Johnson,

3220
01:28:09,311 --> 01:28:11,720
you can listen to some shit recorded
in the 30s and forties right?

3221
01:28:11,721 --> 01:28:11,930
Yeah.

3222
01:28:11,930 --> 01:28:12,200
Yeah.

3223
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:15,050
But think about that two d till today.

3224
01:28:15,350 --> 01:28:19,430
What a gigantic pile of
music that I've seen.

3225
01:28:19,490 --> 01:28:20,990
There's so much out there.

3226
01:28:20,991 --> 01:28:22,220
What a body of work.

3227
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:22,580
Yeah,

3228
01:28:22,580 --> 01:28:26,210
all the different musicians in the
sixties the seventies that fit.

3229
01:28:26,270 --> 01:28:27,530
Oh my God,

3230
01:28:27,860 --> 01:28:29,210
there's so much music.

3231
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:31,700
It's like to come up with new stuff.

3232
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:34,220
It's like to really get me into it.

3233
01:28:34,221 --> 01:28:35,790
It has to be like the black keys spent

3234
01:28:36,390 --> 01:28:37,590
raising some money.

3235
01:28:37,591 --> 01:28:39,580
Like did he blow through
and cars and shit?

3236
01:28:39,590 --> 01:28:39,870
Yeah.

3237
01:28:39,870 --> 01:28:41,040
Like he blew through a lot of it.

3238
01:28:41,190 --> 01:28:43,110
He was on that broke um,

3239
01:28:43,580 --> 01:28:45,600
special that the air and he was just like,

3240
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:46,860
if somebody pulled up,

3241
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:47,550
you know,

3242
01:28:47,550 --> 01:28:49,230
and like a Ferrari,

3243
01:28:49,620 --> 01:28:49,891
you're like,

3244
01:28:49,891 --> 01:28:50,071
yeah,

3245
01:28:50,071 --> 01:28:50,790
that's just hot.

3246
01:28:50,790 --> 01:28:51,990
I got a top that shit.

3247
01:28:52,050 --> 01:28:53,220
So then he would go like the day,

3248
01:28:53,250 --> 01:28:56,580
that day I got the land by
what the brains blown out man.

3249
01:28:56,610 --> 01:29:00,000
Like just to top each other guys
would just buy shit to show off,

3250
01:29:00,001 --> 01:29:00,600
you know,

3251
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:01,830
to compete each other on it.

3252
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:05,940
They say that there's some
ungodly number of people.

3253
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:11,000
It's like 80% of all NFL players are broke
and in bankruptcy within two years of

3254
01:29:11,971 --> 01:29:12,450
retiring.

3255
01:29:12,450 --> 01:29:12,600
It's,

3256
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:13,500
it's incredible.

3257
01:29:13,530 --> 01:29:14,040
I mean,

3258
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:14,341
you know,

3259
01:29:14,341 --> 01:29:15,330
the older I get,

3260
01:29:15,331 --> 01:29:20,331
the more I understand the younger guys
having no like 0 million cents and also

3261
01:29:21,241 --> 01:29:23,400
zero Fike financial Iq.

3262
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:24,120
Like they don't know.

3263
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:24,490
No.

3264
01:29:24,490 --> 01:29:27,030
The 21 to like here's the $3 million.

3265
01:29:27,110 --> 01:29:27,580
And they're like,

3266
01:29:27,580 --> 01:29:28,413
Ooh,

3267
01:29:29,230 --> 01:29:32,050
let's get this part is 22 yeah.

3268
01:29:32,310 --> 01:29:32,551
Yeah.

3269
01:29:32,551 --> 01:29:33,780
I imagine it's crazy,

3270
01:29:33,810 --> 01:29:35,520
but it's crazier when they're like,

3271
01:29:35,521 --> 01:29:36,630
he played 10,

3272
01:29:36,631 --> 01:29:37,111
12,

3273
01:29:37,111 --> 01:29:42,111
16 years like Iverson and he's blown
through like $200 million in your lab or

3274
01:29:43,961 --> 01:29:44,550
some broke now.

3275
01:29:44,550 --> 01:29:45,270
Yes.

3276
01:29:45,270 --> 01:29:46,103
Yes.

3277
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:47,213
And how old is he now?

3278
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:49,590
He is 37 something like that.

3279
01:29:49,591 --> 01:29:51,000
His body's not working right anymore.

3280
01:29:51,060 --> 01:29:51,151
Oh,

3281
01:29:51,151 --> 01:29:51,570
he's down head.

3282
01:29:51,570 --> 01:29:52,110
The NBA.

3283
01:29:52,110 --> 01:29:52,470
Yeah.

3284
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:53,303
And he's,

3285
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:55,560
and he's trying to play,

3286
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:58,590
but he's running through
well into nine figures,

3287
01:29:58,620 --> 01:29:59,160
you know.

3288
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:00,030
Wow.

3289
01:30:00,090 --> 01:30:00,361
I mean,

3290
01:30:00,361 --> 01:30:00,541
I,

3291
01:30:00,541 --> 01:30:00,811
you know,

3292
01:30:00,811 --> 01:30:01,530
and that's,

3293
01:30:01,530 --> 01:30:02,251
and that's,

3294
01:30:02,251 --> 01:30:02,491
you know,

3295
01:30:02,491 --> 01:30:03,151
you have to consider,

3296
01:30:03,151 --> 01:30:03,780
he made a lot of,

3297
01:30:03,780 --> 01:30:04,920
he didn't endorsements.

3298
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:06,270
So nine figures.

3299
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:07,320
Nine figures.

3300
01:30:07,430 --> 01:30:07,680
Yeah.

3301
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:08,850
Make seven figures.

3302
01:30:08,940 --> 01:30:09,390
Yeah.

3303
01:30:09,390 --> 01:30:10,081
Girls would be like,

3304
01:30:10,081 --> 01:30:10,560

3305
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:11,700
he makes seven figures.

3306
01:30:11,900 --> 01:30:12,260
It's like,

3307
01:30:12,260 --> 01:30:15,300
can make nine nine a Bluetooth at all.

3308
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:15,780
Yeah.

3309
01:30:15,780 --> 01:30:17,010
That shit crazy,

3310
01:30:17,011 --> 01:30:17,280
man.

3311
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:20,580
Woopsies it's crazy that

3312
01:30:22,940 --> 01:30:23,670
it's so much.

3313
01:30:23,670 --> 01:30:23,950
They,

3314
01:30:23,950 --> 01:30:25,250
they interviewed one uh,

3315
01:30:25,290 --> 01:30:26,100
defensive,

3316
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:27,420
like a guy on the,

3317
01:30:27,421 --> 01:30:28,110
on the,

3318
01:30:28,110 --> 01:30:29,220
the special on the,

3319
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:29,971
the broke thing.

3320
01:30:29,971 --> 01:30:31,170
And he was like,

3321
01:30:31,171 --> 01:30:31,981
I don't know why man.

3322
01:30:31,981 --> 01:30:32,670
But he was like,

3323
01:30:32,670 --> 01:30:33,930
everybody had a car wash.

3324
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:40,410
He's like,

3325
01:30:40,780 --> 01:30:42,610
we all had a fucking car wash man.

3326
01:30:42,670 --> 01:30:43,120
That shit.

3327
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:44,680
That shit did not last.

3328
01:30:44,681 --> 01:30:46,840
Like we all spent money on a car.

3329
01:30:46,841 --> 01:30:48,670
We bought a carwash.

3330
01:30:48,910 --> 01:30:49,331
Yeah man,

3331
01:30:49,331 --> 01:30:50,780
you ain't got your own carwash.

3332
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:51,430
Ah,

3333
01:30:51,430 --> 01:30:52,830
and Bart Scott had the bay.

3334
01:30:52,831 --> 01:30:53,664
He was like,

3335
01:30:53,710 --> 01:30:54,361
you buy shit.

3336
01:30:54,361 --> 01:30:54,901
It's Anessa.

3337
01:30:54,901 --> 01:30:56,380
He's not broke at all.

3338
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:57,850
And he's still playing and he's like,

3339
01:30:57,851 --> 01:30:59,140
I'm smarter with my money.

3340
01:30:59,350 --> 01:30:59,711
But he's like,

3341
01:30:59,711 --> 01:30:59,861
you know,

3342
01:30:59,861 --> 01:31:01,000
everybody's a stupid purchase.

3343
01:31:01,001 --> 01:31:01,781
I bought a coat,

3344
01:31:01,781 --> 01:31:02,980
I think it was made a wolf

3345
01:31:04,710 --> 01:31:07,630
and he's like,

3346
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:12,880
I wore that shit once
and it was like $35,000

3347
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:15,670
you can wear a wolf collide.

3348
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:19,200
Think so man Christ I get wolf coat.

3349
01:31:20,580 --> 01:31:22,530
That shit would be my dogs at attack it.

3350
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:24,720
Let Little Wolf in the house like that.

3351
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:26,550
I was thinking about how absurd is it,

3352
01:31:26,580 --> 01:31:31,580
like how unprepared my mind is
to see grown men in any type of,

3353
01:31:32,161 --> 01:31:33,510
for like if they're not,

3354
01:31:33,930 --> 01:31:38,160
if you don't have like an AK 47 in
your hand or you're not a coke dealer,

3355
01:31:38,161 --> 01:31:39,780
are you stepping off a team plane?

3356
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:40,290
Yeah.

3357
01:31:40,290 --> 01:31:43,890
I'm not like mentally
prepared to see a man in for,

3358
01:31:43,930 --> 01:31:44,140
you know,

3359
01:31:44,140 --> 01:31:45,110
you're rushing or,

3360
01:31:45,140 --> 01:31:45,450
yeah.

3361
01:31:45,450 --> 01:31:46,620
Eat inside beer garden.

3362
01:31:46,940 --> 01:31:47,731
Patch it in your hand.

3363
01:31:47,731 --> 01:31:48,180
Sure.

3364
01:31:48,180 --> 01:31:50,580
And you've got your collision to cop
and you're ready to fucking get down.

3365
01:31:50,610 --> 01:31:51,720
But other than that,

3366
01:31:51,721 --> 01:31:53,540
walking around with
dude have first shit on.

3367
01:31:53,570 --> 01:31:54,403
So warm.

3368
01:31:54,420 --> 01:31:55,000
Have you ever worn it?

3369
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:55,520
Fur coat.

3370
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:58,080
I put my mother's on when I was like 12.

3371
01:31:58,110 --> 01:31:58,620
Yeah.

3372
01:31:58,620 --> 01:31:59,860
I have a friend who,

3373
01:31:59,861 --> 01:32:00,130
uh,

3374
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:05,130
is a rich guy back in Boston and he
wore a full length fur coat and a,

3375
01:32:05,540 --> 01:32:05,831
I go,

3376
01:32:05,831 --> 01:32:06,700
what is that?

3377
01:32:06,701 --> 01:32:06,971
It's like,

3378
01:32:06,971 --> 01:32:07,660
it's a mink coat.

3379
01:32:07,660 --> 01:32:07,871
I go,

3380
01:32:07,871 --> 01:32:09,220
you're wearing a mink coat?

3381
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:09,791
He goes,

3382
01:32:09,791 --> 01:32:10,300
yeah.

3383
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:10,511
He goes,

3384
01:32:10,511 --> 01:32:11,260
you got to try it on.

3385
01:32:11,260 --> 01:32:11,531
I go,

3386
01:32:11,531 --> 01:32:12,250
really?

3387
01:32:12,250 --> 01:32:12,521
He goes,

3388
01:32:12,521 --> 01:32:12,671
yeah,

3389
01:32:12,671 --> 01:32:13,091
try it on.

3390
01:32:13,091 --> 01:32:13,601
Try It on and go.

3391
01:32:13,601 --> 01:32:14,290
Okay.

3392
01:32:14,290 --> 01:32:14,561
I'm like,

3393
01:32:14,561 --> 01:32:15,460
oh my God.

3394
01:32:15,490 --> 01:32:15,941
Crazy.

3395
01:32:15,941 --> 01:32:17,080
It's so warm.

3396
01:32:17,260 --> 01:32:18,490
They're so comfortable.

3397
01:32:18,910 --> 01:32:19,540
You know,

3398
01:32:19,540 --> 01:32:22,780
it's gross when they have the legs
still attached around the top.

3399
01:32:23,670 --> 01:32:25,860
That's gangster shrunk and curves.

3400
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:27,110
That's pretty worn.

3401
01:32:27,140 --> 01:32:27,851
Shrunken heads.

3402
01:32:27,851 --> 01:32:28,061
Look,

3403
01:32:28,061 --> 01:32:29,830
could I got my fucking conquest?

3404
01:32:29,860 --> 01:32:30,670
Yeah.

3405
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:30,821
Yeah.

3406
01:32:30,821 --> 01:32:31,571
It keeps you warm.

3407
01:32:31,571 --> 01:32:32,141
People like,

3408
01:32:32,141 --> 01:32:32,710
well,

3409
01:32:32,710 --> 01:32:33,071
you know,

3410
01:32:33,071 --> 01:32:35,130
I really think it's fucked up that uh,

3411
01:32:35,170 --> 01:32:38,380
people kill minx it is
fucked up that people kill.

3412
01:32:38,381 --> 01:32:39,820
Makes it totally is.

3413
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:41,980
But you know what happens
when people don't kill Max,

3414
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:43,960
they get eaten alive by walls.

3415
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:45,400
Yeah,

3416
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:45,551
yeah.

3417
01:32:45,551 --> 01:32:46,390
They get killed.

3418
01:32:46,470 --> 01:32:48,130
Like they don't live like,

3419
01:32:48,131 --> 01:32:50,440
it's not like a mixed is
going to live forever.

3420
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:51,610
I get it though.

3421
01:32:51,820 --> 01:32:52,840
It's like it's tough.

3422
01:32:52,870 --> 01:32:53,710
It's tough to,

3423
01:32:54,780 --> 01:32:55,091
you know,

3424
01:32:55,091 --> 01:32:56,620
rationally look at it and say,

3425
01:32:56,621 --> 01:32:59,170
you think it's okay to kill
an animal just for it's for,

3426
01:32:59,290 --> 01:33:00,130
I say no.

3427
01:33:00,190 --> 01:33:00,791
I say no.

3428
01:33:00,791 --> 01:33:04,210
I say the only way you should kill an
animal is if you're going to use the whole

3429
01:33:04,211 --> 01:33:04,630
animal.

3430
01:33:04,630 --> 01:33:04,920
He,

3431
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:05,753
it,

3432
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:06,671
he did for sure.

3433
01:33:06,671 --> 01:33:08,230
I mean that I think is the most important.

3434
01:33:08,231 --> 01:33:09,910
And if you use the other
parts of it as well.

3435
01:33:09,911 --> 01:33:10,690
Yeah,

3436
01:33:10,690 --> 01:33:12,130
but just the for man,

3437
01:33:12,131 --> 01:33:13,180
that seems fucked up.

3438
01:33:13,750 --> 01:33:14,400
I agree.

3439
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:14,621
All right.

3440
01:33:14,621 --> 01:33:19,330
And then what's even worse or on the
same line is when they kill the fucking

3441
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:20,650
elephants for the tusks,

3442
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:22,233
it's dark.

3443
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:23,410
It's dark.

3444
01:33:23,410 --> 01:33:27,560
There's a big controversy about
that with a pool players because uh,

3445
01:33:27,820 --> 01:33:31,270
there's a lot of parts of pool
cues that they use ivory for.

3446
01:33:31,450 --> 01:33:32,283
Oh really?

3447
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:32,861
Yeah,

3448
01:33:32,861 --> 01:33:35,500
but it has to be pre ban ivory and they,

3449
01:33:35,501 --> 01:33:40,060
they're really good at like
monitoring where the ivory comes from.

3450
01:33:40,061 --> 01:33:43,270
And occasionally people get
arrested for selling illegal ivory.

3451
01:33:43,271 --> 01:33:44,104
Like there was a guy,

3452
01:33:44,250 --> 01:33:45,083
there was a god,

3453
01:33:45,460 --> 01:33:48,490
he distributed stuff for pool,

3454
01:33:48,491 --> 01:33:53,110
a cute makers like a ivory and exotic
woods and stuff along those lines.

3455
01:33:53,111 --> 01:33:56,560
And he got arrested a few
years back because he,

3456
01:33:56,561 --> 01:33:56,800
uh,

3457
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:58,930
he was selling illegal ivory.

3458
01:33:59,230 --> 01:34:00,820
They take that shit very seriously.

3459
01:34:00,850 --> 01:34:01,290
Oh,

3460
01:34:01,290 --> 01:34:02,380
I lad.

3461
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:03,760
But you're allowed to have it.

3462
01:34:03,910 --> 01:34:05,980
You're allowed to have the band ivory.

3463
01:34:06,020 --> 01:34:06,280
Yeah.

3464
01:34:06,280 --> 01:34:08,320
And the idea is that first of all,

3465
01:34:08,350 --> 01:34:09,340
those animals are dead.

3466
01:34:09,460 --> 01:34:09,881
Okay.

3467
01:34:09,881 --> 01:34:11,800
And they killed so many of them,

3468
01:34:11,801 --> 01:34:14,860
so it was worth so much
money that between,

3469
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:20,250
I think it was like 1980 and eight
whenever the band was in institute in 1987

3470
01:34:21,581 --> 01:34:21,840
there,

3471
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:24,640
their population dipped by over a million.

3472
01:34:24,641 --> 01:34:28,180
I think they were at like 1.5 million
and they were down to 500,000.

3473
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:29,380
So,

3474
01:34:29,380 --> 01:34:30,060
um,

3475
01:34:30,060 --> 01:34:30,880
it's,

3476
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:35,880
it's imperative that people understand
that like a lot of the ivory that you use

3477
01:34:36,371 --> 01:34:38,020
today and stuff is like,

3478
01:34:38,021 --> 01:34:39,280
there's so much of it,

3479
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:41,020
you don't have to kill anything for it.

3480
01:34:41,230 --> 01:34:42,820
And if you don't use it,

3481
01:34:42,970 --> 01:34:46,900
it's kind of fucked because that means
somebody murdered these animals for their

3482
01:34:46,901 --> 01:34:49,030
ivory and then didn't use him for things.

3483
01:34:49,060 --> 01:34:49,720
Yeah.

3484
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:52,750
But if you murdered him now
and use the robbery for shit,

3485
01:34:52,780 --> 01:34:53,321
it's fucked up.

3486
01:34:53,321 --> 01:34:54,490
Like it's a real gray area.

3487
01:34:54,491 --> 01:34:55,450
If you look at it that way,

3488
01:34:55,720 --> 01:34:56,553
it's like,

3489
01:34:56,830 --> 01:35:01,830
would you be willing to have ivory tusks
if you found them in a store in your

3490
01:35:02,031 --> 01:35:02,391
house,

3491
01:35:02,391 --> 01:35:03,110
like mounted?

3492
01:35:03,110 --> 01:35:05,960
They're beautiful and the crazy to look
at it and like if you've ever seen him

3493
01:35:05,961 --> 01:35:06,350
in a minute,

3494
01:35:06,350 --> 01:35:09,140
there's a mammoth Tusk at this museum.

3495
01:35:09,170 --> 01:35:10,430
It's fucking fascinating,

3496
01:35:10,431 --> 01:35:11,000
man.

3497
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:11,833
It's amazing.

3498
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:14,090
But as far as we know,

3499
01:35:14,091 --> 01:35:15,350
nobody ever shot a mammoth.

3500
01:35:15,410 --> 01:35:16,040
Right,

3501
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:16,300
right,

3502
01:35:16,300 --> 01:35:16,580
right.

3503
01:35:16,580 --> 01:35:20,270
Dealing with an elephant that some dude
put a sniper bullet through his fucking

3504
01:35:20,271 --> 01:35:21,210
brain and see,

3505
01:35:21,290 --> 01:35:24,050
I think it make me too
sad around probably,

3506
01:35:24,060 --> 01:35:24,600
right.

3507
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:24,800
Yeah.

3508
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:25,420
Because the only,

3509
01:35:25,420 --> 01:35:26,760
there's only one way you get those things.

3510
01:35:26,761 --> 01:35:27,740
And the animal will two ways.

3511
01:35:27,741 --> 01:35:28,730
The animal dies on its own,

3512
01:35:28,731 --> 01:35:29,750
which is pretty fucking rare.

3513
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:30,290
No,

3514
01:35:30,290 --> 01:35:32,600
that's not how usually you
get to live a long time.

3515
01:35:32,940 --> 01:35:33,740
They can live a long time.

3516
01:35:33,740 --> 01:35:34,100
Yeah.

3517
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:34,430
Yeah.

3518
01:35:34,430 --> 01:35:35,450
Or you shoot that.

3519
01:35:35,540 --> 01:35:36,350
That's the other problem.

3520
01:35:36,350 --> 01:35:38,480
They live a long time and
they're fucking smart.

3521
01:35:39,290 --> 01:35:39,830
You know?

3522
01:35:39,830 --> 01:35:40,730
Elephants are smart.

3523
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:44,900
Elephants a recognize each other after
not seeing each other for like 20 years.

3524
01:35:45,500 --> 01:35:46,400
Like it's crazy.

3525
01:35:46,401 --> 01:35:47,234
It's crazy to watch.

3526
01:35:47,270 --> 01:35:48,860
They run over and grab trunks,

3527
01:35:49,010 --> 01:35:53,150
wrap their trunks around each other and
from knowing a cuddling practically,

3528
01:35:53,151 --> 01:35:53,984
you know?

3529
01:35:54,110 --> 01:35:54,650
Yeah.

3530
01:35:54,650 --> 01:35:55,031
It's,

3531
01:35:55,031 --> 01:35:55,490
it's,

3532
01:35:55,490 --> 01:35:57,800
it's fucked up that year.

3533
01:35:57,801 --> 01:35:58,310
It was,

3534
01:35:58,310 --> 01:36:00,230
people just slaughtered them for ivory.

3535
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:02,010
That's the thing too is you're,

3536
01:36:02,620 --> 01:36:06,140
they're killing these big
beautiful animals just for
one thing and then they're

3537
01:36:06,141 --> 01:36:06,261
like,

3538
01:36:06,261 --> 01:36:06,381
yeah,

3539
01:36:06,381 --> 01:36:06,830
that's cool.

3540
01:36:06,830 --> 01:36:07,750
And then they move along.

3541
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:09,830
Those animals will fucking
kill you too though.

3542
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:11,020
Are these Elvis got,

3543
01:36:11,030 --> 01:36:11,380
fuck.

3544
01:36:11,380 --> 01:36:12,213
All right.

3545
01:36:12,350 --> 01:36:13,000
Wow.

3546
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:16,630
You imagine having to carry that
look at the size of that thing in.

3547
01:36:17,330 --> 01:36:18,500
I don't think they have big decks too.

3548
01:36:18,590 --> 01:36:19,910
I think he's trying to go deep,

3549
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,410
but it's like barely has a deck.

3550
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:21,731
Ooh.

3551
01:36:21,731 --> 01:36:26,731
There is that look at the size of
his body as muscles on the thing.

3552
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:28,520
You ever thought about that?

3553
01:36:28,540 --> 01:36:30,230
That'd be cool if they walk
around with that all the time.

3554
01:36:30,290 --> 01:36:31,640
What do you think he squats that guy?

3555
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:31,971
Oh,

3556
01:36:31,971 --> 01:36:32,930
he could do a house,

3557
01:36:33,110 --> 01:36:34,210
but a whole house on his back.

3558
01:36:34,211 --> 01:36:35,044
He'll squatted.

3559
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:35,860
Oh my God.

3560
01:36:35,860 --> 01:36:37,280
Look at the size of his muscles.

3561
01:36:37,310 --> 01:36:39,020
What a freaky fucking animal.

3562
01:36:39,020 --> 01:36:40,430
He just finished wrapping right now.

3563
01:36:40,431 --> 01:36:40,930
He's just like,

3564
01:36:40,930 --> 01:36:41,390
ah.

3565
01:36:41,390 --> 01:36:43,040
He's in an intense,

3566
01:36:43,220 --> 01:36:44,510
elephants are so much,

3567
01:36:44,690 --> 01:36:46,850
so much weirder than the Avatar people.

3568
01:36:47,660 --> 01:36:48,080
Oh yeah.

3569
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:48,710
Yeah,

3570
01:36:48,710 --> 01:36:49,190
they are.

3571
01:36:49,190 --> 01:36:50,060
They're so weird.

3572
01:36:50,270 --> 01:36:52,430
That trunk is completely alien.

3573
01:36:52,670 --> 01:36:54,860
A long knows that pick shit up.

3574
01:36:54,890 --> 01:36:55,723
What?

3575
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:57,470
There's no other thing like it.

3576
01:36:57,590 --> 01:36:58,010
Oh,

3577
01:36:58,010 --> 01:36:59,390
just see that slow.

3578
01:37:00,120 --> 01:37:02,240
That's a huge data hog on that

3579
01:37:03,980 --> 01:37:04,850
size of that thing.

3580
01:37:04,851 --> 01:37:05,840
Holy Shit.

3581
01:37:05,870 --> 01:37:06,740
Oh my God.

3582
01:37:06,770 --> 01:37:09,620
Are we allowed to show 'em
elephant hogs on your streams?

3583
01:37:09,890 --> 01:37:11,290
It's okay because it's like nature.

3584
01:37:11,310 --> 01:37:12,143
Yeah.

3585
01:37:12,290 --> 01:37:12,531
Yeah.

3586
01:37:12,531 --> 01:37:12,861
That was,

3587
01:37:12,861 --> 01:37:13,460
uh,

3588
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:16,190
that was a big deck that could kill you.

3589
01:37:16,340 --> 01:37:17,120
That's,

3590
01:37:17,120 --> 01:37:18,380
that's definitely kind of things.

3591
01:37:18,381 --> 01:37:20,270
A horses dicta I don't think that,

3592
01:37:20,271 --> 01:37:21,110
I think that it's bigger.

3593
01:37:21,140 --> 01:37:21,561
No,

3594
01:37:21,561 --> 01:37:21,771
no,

3595
01:37:21,771 --> 01:37:21,900
no.

3596
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:22,880
We just saw it right there.

3597
01:37:22,910 --> 01:37:24,290
Horses ever ridiculous decks.

3598
01:37:26,630 --> 01:37:27,680
A lot of people don't know this.

3599
01:37:27,681 --> 01:37:28,730
Smaller and yeah,

3600
01:37:28,731 --> 01:37:29,510
we'll uh,

3601
01:37:29,510 --> 01:37:31,460
we'll be visiting again with,

3602
01:37:31,461 --> 01:37:32,240
um,

3603
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:33,920
our friend Dr. Christopher Ryan.

3604
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:35,990
He's going to be a pack on the podcast.

3605
01:37:35,991 --> 01:37:37,580
He's the author of that book,

3606
01:37:37,581 --> 01:37:39,500
Sex at dawn and uh,

3607
01:37:39,530 --> 01:37:44,530
he'll be on a Monday the 25th.

3608
01:37:45,170 --> 01:37:46,003
Um,

3609
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:46,910
and uh,

3610
01:37:46,910 --> 01:37:47,840
looking forward to that.

3611
01:37:47,841 --> 01:37:51,110
But one of the things that he
said is that gorillas in his book,

3612
01:37:51,111 --> 01:37:52,460
he talks about Dick size.

3613
01:37:52,670 --> 01:37:55,980
Gorillas have really little decks
and the reason they have little dicks

3614
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:59,760
is because they didn't have to
like have a big Dick to dominate.

3615
01:38:00,180 --> 01:38:02,790
They just have a bunch of
chicks who listened to them.

3616
01:38:02,970 --> 01:38:04,140
The girls aren't slutty,

3617
01:38:04,290 --> 01:38:06,780
they stay put and he doesn't
really need a big Dick.

3618
01:38:06,870 --> 01:38:07,980
So he's got this little tiny,

3619
01:38:07,981 --> 01:38:09,810
tiny dick cause it's not about her,

3620
01:38:09,811 --> 01:38:11,580
it's about him getting on top,

3621
01:38:11,581 --> 01:38:12,414
pinning her down,

3622
01:38:12,540 --> 01:38:14,700
sticking little tiny dick and
there she ain't going anywhere.

3623
01:38:14,710 --> 01:38:16,080
He doesn't have to like
prove himself to her.

3624
01:38:16,110 --> 01:38:16,620
Right.

3625
01:38:16,620 --> 01:38:20,380
Whereas chimpanzee chicks are whore.

3626
01:38:21,570 --> 01:38:25,050
Chimpanzees don't run
any sort of a brothel.

3627
01:38:25,170 --> 01:38:27,510
They don't have like a heroin
checks like a gorilla does.

3628
01:38:27,720 --> 01:38:29,250
Chimpanzees can't rock it like that.

3629
01:38:29,251 --> 01:38:31,170
Chimpanzee girls are just too slutty.

3630
01:38:31,530 --> 01:38:32,700
So chimpanzees,

3631
01:38:32,940 --> 01:38:33,773
because of this,

3632
01:38:33,900 --> 01:38:35,430
have enormous testicles.

3633
01:38:35,700 --> 01:38:39,120
And the reason why they have
enormous tax goals on a male primate,

3634
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:44,160
the testicle size is directly
proportionate to the amount
of promiscuous females

3635
01:38:44,161 --> 01:38:44,994
that are in your area.

3636
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:45,540
Really?

3637
01:38:45,540 --> 01:38:46,170
Yes.

3638
01:38:46,170 --> 01:38:50,610
So if the females are monogamous and
you don't have to compete to earn their

3639
01:38:50,940 --> 01:38:51,780
trust and their,

3640
01:38:51,781 --> 01:38:52,614
their sex,

3641
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:53,760
your balls shrivel up,

3642
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:54,833
Dick shrivels up.

3643
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:56,250
You don't need as much is,

3644
01:38:56,610 --> 01:38:57,443
but when there's,

3645
01:38:57,450 --> 01:38:58,830
when there's competition,

3646
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:00,660
when there's a lot of shit going down,

3647
01:39:00,870 --> 01:39:03,600
that's when you need to have
big balls and a big deck.

3648
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:07,350
Humans have the biggest dicks
out of all the primates.

3649
01:39:07,770 --> 01:39:09,210
Human dicks are bigger than chimps,

3650
01:39:09,211 --> 01:39:10,044
chimps her next.

3651
01:39:10,380 --> 01:39:14,760
But it's because human girls to the
sluttiest to the sluts and all the animal

3652
01:39:14,761 --> 01:39:15,360
community.

3653
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:15,481
Oh,

3654
01:39:15,481 --> 01:39:15,811
right.

3655
01:39:15,811 --> 01:39:15,990
Yeah.

3656
01:39:15,990 --> 01:39:17,010
Those dirty bitches.

3657
01:39:17,030 --> 01:39:19,290
So our decks have to oh yeah.

3658
01:39:19,650 --> 01:39:22,380
And the big of the dude's Dick
is the most likely bigger,

3659
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:23,490
the amount of slots he's around.

3660
01:39:23,870 --> 01:39:24,440
Wow.

3661
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:27,880
And that crazy genetically like
in his environment where you know,

3662
01:39:27,900 --> 01:39:31,060
he was born and conceived ball size too.

3663
01:39:31,260 --> 01:39:31,470
Yeah.

3664
01:39:31,470 --> 01:39:31,711
I mean,

3665
01:39:31,711 --> 01:39:34,260
over the course of obviously
generation after generation,

3666
01:39:34,261 --> 01:39:35,610
it's not like it's an instant thing.

3667
01:39:35,790 --> 01:39:36,451
Your mom's a whore,

3668
01:39:36,451 --> 01:39:37,280
you got a giant deck.

3669
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:38,113
Right.

3670
01:39:40,110 --> 01:39:41,040
It's not like that,

3671
01:39:41,041 --> 01:39:41,874
but,

3672
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:43,470
but that's the reason for it.

3673
01:39:43,740 --> 01:39:44,520
Wow.

3674
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:45,270
And then fucked.

3675
01:39:45,270 --> 01:39:45,840
Yeah,

3676
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:46,673
absolutely.

3677
01:39:46,700 --> 01:39:47,533
But it makes sense.

3678
01:39:47,730 --> 01:39:48,041
I mean we,

3679
01:39:48,041 --> 01:39:48,171
we,

3680
01:39:48,171 --> 01:39:48,441
we,

3681
01:39:48,441 --> 01:39:51,120
we look at all sexual
things so emotionally,

3682
01:39:51,330 --> 01:39:51,601
you know,

3683
01:39:51,601 --> 01:39:52,860
we always look at it like,

3684
01:39:53,190 --> 01:39:53,461
you know,

3685
01:39:53,461 --> 01:39:54,900
we look at it as ourselves,

3686
01:39:55,170 --> 01:39:55,471
you know,

3687
01:39:55,471 --> 01:39:55,651
like,

3688
01:39:55,651 --> 01:39:55,740
Whoa,

3689
01:39:55,740 --> 01:39:56,041
Whoa,

3690
01:39:56,041 --> 01:39:57,660
what did you care about the fucking,

3691
01:39:57,890 --> 01:39:58,530
what does secure,

3692
01:39:58,530 --> 01:39:59,400
how big my Duke is.

3693
01:39:59,401 --> 01:40:00,190
If you love me,

3694
01:40:00,190 --> 01:40:00,660
you know?

3695
01:40:00,660 --> 01:40:03,130
But nature doesn't care
about your emotions at all.

3696
01:40:03,300 --> 01:40:04,470
Nature doesn't care about,

3697
01:40:04,471 --> 01:40:04,711
you know,

3698
01:40:04,711 --> 01:40:04,951
your,

3699
01:40:04,951 --> 01:40:07,230
your desire for acceptance and it doesn't,

3700
01:40:07,260 --> 01:40:08,400
it cares about numbers.

3701
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:11,940
It cares about who is going
to make the most babies.

3702
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,920
Who's going to be the
most effective breeding?

3703
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:16,980
Who's going to have the bigger dick
that's going to transfer to his children

3704
01:40:16,981 --> 01:40:17,880
having a bigger deck?

3705
01:40:17,881 --> 01:40:18,270
What?

3706
01:40:18,270 --> 01:40:21,540
Who's going to have the most ambitious
personality that transfers into the

3707
01:40:21,541 --> 01:40:25,860
genetics and passes on epigenetically
to offspring and they become more

3708
01:40:25,861 --> 01:40:27,270
aggressive and more ambitious.

3709
01:40:27,271 --> 01:40:29,400
And I mean that's nature favors.

3710
01:40:29,401 --> 01:40:33,750
Nature favors like the numbers of the
whole nature isn't really like looking at

3711
01:40:33,751 --> 01:40:35,340
your emotions and your problems.

3712
01:40:35,341 --> 01:40:39,120
Your emotions are basically a trick and
all of them are just set up to get you

3713
01:40:39,121 --> 01:40:40,920
to do shit the nature wants you to do.

3714
01:40:41,130 --> 01:40:42,510
Whether it's your emotions for your,

3715
01:40:42,511 --> 01:40:42,751
you know,

3716
01:40:42,751 --> 01:40:44,340
your connection to your loved ones,

3717
01:40:44,490 --> 01:40:46,110
it's real as it is and it's palpable.

3718
01:40:46,111 --> 01:40:46,944
It is to you.

3719
01:40:46,980 --> 01:40:48,530
It's really also uh,

3720
01:40:48,720 --> 01:40:49,070
uh,

3721
01:40:49,070 --> 01:40:49,903
it's,

3722
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:50,390
it's,

3723
01:40:50,390 --> 01:40:54,040
it's sort of a reward system
that the universe has set up to

3724
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:55,930
make sure that you keep
interacting with people,

3725
01:40:55,960 --> 01:40:57,490
keep breeding and they,

3726
01:40:57,530 --> 01:41:02,440
and keep perpetuating the
civilization in its current form.

3727
01:41:02,650 --> 01:41:04,360
Like all these emotions are all,

3728
01:41:04,530 --> 01:41:08,320
it's all set up to make sure that you
keep the universal then give a fuck about

3729
01:41:08,321 --> 01:41:08,870
you,

3730
01:41:08,870 --> 01:41:09,370
right?

3731
01:41:09,370 --> 01:41:10,020
Yeah.

3732
01:41:10,020 --> 01:41:15,020
Is busy constructing a gram design that
you're a part of and that's also your

3733
01:41:16,091 --> 01:41:16,631
big deck.

3734
01:41:16,631 --> 01:41:17,740
You Big Dick as a part of that?

3735
01:41:17,741 --> 01:41:20,530
Tommy Big Dick is a part of
about the is grand design.

3736
01:41:20,531 --> 01:41:21,430
It's part of the blueprint.

3737
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:22,460
Yeah.

3738
01:41:22,460 --> 01:41:23,293
Result of it.

3739
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:24,513
What is that?

3740
01:41:24,850 --> 01:41:25,121
What do you,

3741
01:41:25,121 --> 01:41:25,954
what is this?

3742
01:41:26,230 --> 01:41:27,840
It's that thing that
doctor found the other,

3743
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:28,091
oh,

3744
01:41:28,091 --> 01:41:29,200
the doctor found the alien.

3745
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:29,980
Hmm.

3746
01:41:29,980 --> 01:41:30,910
It looks realistic.

3747
01:41:31,910 --> 01:41:33,070
Totally looks like a real person.

3748
01:41:33,100 --> 01:41:34,150
I'm a so I thought you were.

3749
01:41:34,151 --> 01:41:35,890
So is this something so much worse?

3750
01:41:36,040 --> 01:41:37,090
This is a birth defect.

3751
01:41:37,180 --> 01:41:38,320
I don't think that's funny at all.

3752
01:41:38,460 --> 01:41:39,280
What is this?

3753
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:39,611
I don't know.

3754
01:41:39,611 --> 01:41:42,580
It's listed as a frog person.

3755
01:41:42,610 --> 01:41:43,000
Half.

3756
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:43,270
Yeah.

3757
01:41:43,270 --> 01:41:43,781
Half human.

3758
01:41:43,781 --> 01:41:47,200
Half Frog and cephalic baby.

3759
01:41:47,230 --> 01:41:47,441
Yeah.

3760
01:41:47,441 --> 01:41:47,781
That's a,

3761
01:41:47,781 --> 01:41:49,510
that's a baby with a
terrible disease buddy.

3762
01:41:50,620 --> 01:41:50,850
Oh,

3763
01:41:50,850 --> 01:41:51,190
sure.

3764
01:41:51,190 --> 01:41:52,023
That was real.

3765
01:41:52,270 --> 01:41:52,630
Yeah.

3766
01:41:52,630 --> 01:41:53,590
I thought that was a frog.

3767
01:41:53,650 --> 01:41:53,891
No,

3768
01:41:53,891 --> 01:41:54,790
it looks like a frog.

3769
01:41:55,900 --> 01:41:56,651
It looks like a frog,

3770
01:41:56,651 --> 01:42:01,480
but it's a sick to z and it funny like
it was funny for a couple seconds and

3771
01:42:01,481 --> 01:42:02,270
then it wasn't funny.

3772
01:42:02,270 --> 01:42:03,050
Yeah.

3773
01:42:03,050 --> 01:42:06,200
It's funny when we thought it
was an animation just like that,

3774
01:42:06,810 --> 01:42:07,301
that one does.

3775
01:42:07,301 --> 01:42:08,200
He like this disease?

3776
01:42:08,260 --> 01:42:09,820
I was freaky.

3777
01:42:09,850 --> 01:42:10,091
Oh,

3778
01:42:10,091 --> 01:42:10,924
what is that?

3779
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:12,190
I forget the name of the disease.

3780
01:42:12,191 --> 01:42:12,820
It's where it's,

3781
01:42:12,820 --> 01:42:13,653
uh,

3782
01:42:13,900 --> 01:42:14,580
oh yeah.

3783
01:42:14,580 --> 01:42:15,413
I don't really want to anyway.

3784
01:42:15,580 --> 01:42:15,820
Yeah,

3785
01:42:15,820 --> 01:42:16,541
don't watch that.

3786
01:42:16,541 --> 01:42:17,960
That's a horrible baby.

3787
01:42:18,040 --> 01:42:19,000
It looks like a lizard.

3788
01:42:19,540 --> 01:42:20,210
Yeah,

3789
01:42:20,210 --> 01:42:21,440
she's just mad.

3790
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:26,170
There's a lot of bad bad rolls of
the dice you can get for reals.

3791
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:28,860
Do you ever feel bad
about the midget joke?

3792
01:42:28,861 --> 01:42:29,694
He do.

3793
01:42:30,250 --> 01:42:31,083
Um,

3794
01:42:31,290 --> 01:42:32,860
it's talking about bad rolls of the dice.

3795
01:42:34,210 --> 01:42:34,850
I mean,

3796
01:42:34,850 --> 01:42:35,683
I,

3797
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:37,750
I felt badly.

3798
01:42:38,260 --> 01:42:39,860
I haven't done that in a
long time cause you know,

3799
01:42:39,880 --> 01:42:40,660
I just,

3800
01:42:40,660 --> 01:42:42,490
it got old to me like just saying it,

3801
01:42:42,930 --> 01:42:44,440
but I haven't said it a while,

3802
01:42:44,470 --> 01:42:46,270
but um,

3803
01:42:47,830 --> 01:42:48,700
I felt bad when this,

3804
01:42:48,701 --> 01:42:52,750
this couple one time at a show got really
like the woman was crying hysterically

3805
01:42:52,870 --> 01:42:53,703
over it.

3806
01:42:53,990 --> 01:42:54,823
Um,

3807
01:42:55,090 --> 01:42:55,923
whoa.

3808
01:42:56,140 --> 01:42:57,380
Like it was so weird.

3809
01:42:57,381 --> 01:43:01,860
Is she a big fan of little house
on the prairie or she is a,

3810
01:43:01,880 --> 01:43:02,830
what's a show with a midget?

3811
01:43:03,190 --> 01:43:03,850
Um,

3812
01:43:03,850 --> 01:43:04,001
oh,

3813
01:43:04,001 --> 01:43:04,834
the big people.

3814
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:05,351
Little world.

3815
01:43:05,351 --> 01:43:05,710
Right.

3816
01:43:05,710 --> 01:43:06,280
That's one.

3817
01:43:06,280 --> 01:43:06,760
That's one.

3818
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:08,020
I don't know why I said a
little house in my prayer.

3819
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:09,470
I bottle little.

3820
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:10,481
Was She,

3821
01:43:10,481 --> 01:43:10,910
uh,

3822
01:43:10,910 --> 01:43:11,651
the wizard of Oz?

3823
01:43:11,651 --> 01:43:11,981
Maybe it was.

3824
01:43:11,981 --> 01:43:13,090
That was,

3825
01:43:13,091 --> 01:43:13,600
that was it.

3826
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:15,340
It was maybe that was a big one for her.

3827
01:43:15,370 --> 01:43:16,203
She really,

3828
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:17,160
yeah,

3829
01:43:17,160 --> 01:43:19,790
they got upset about that.

3830
01:43:19,860 --> 01:43:20,321
She talked to,

3831
01:43:20,321 --> 01:43:21,131
you know,

3832
01:43:21,131 --> 01:43:24,310
her husband followed me
offstage to the bathroom.

3833
01:43:24,450 --> 01:43:24,610
Oh,

3834
01:43:24,610 --> 01:43:24,820
Jay.

3835
01:43:24,820 --> 01:43:25,181
Anybody.

3836
01:43:25,181 --> 01:43:26,860
He goes a really funny stuff,

3837
01:43:26,890 --> 01:43:27,480
really funny.

3838
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:27,821
And I was like,

3839
01:43:27,821 --> 01:43:28,390
thanks man.

3840
01:43:28,390 --> 01:43:31,130
I thought it was just like a
regular guy thinks will happen.

3841
01:43:31,680 --> 01:43:32,680
Then he goes in and then,

3842
01:43:32,681 --> 01:43:33,514
um,

3843
01:43:33,970 --> 01:43:35,980
you know that that image is stuff you do,

3844
01:43:36,010 --> 01:43:36,880
you know those jokes.

3845
01:43:37,180 --> 01:43:37,810
And I was like,

3846
01:43:37,810 --> 01:43:38,560
Oh shit,

3847
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:39,160
I really thought it,

3848
01:43:39,160 --> 01:43:40,070
it's almost gonna Punch me.

3849
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:40,780
And I was like,

3850
01:43:40,780 --> 01:43:41,613
Yep.

3851
01:43:42,030 --> 01:43:42,611
And he goes,

3852
01:43:42,611 --> 01:43:43,444
um,

3853
01:43:44,740 --> 01:43:44,891
yeah,

3854
01:43:44,891 --> 01:43:45,690
so you know,

3855
01:43:45,690 --> 01:43:45,890
my,

3856
01:43:45,890 --> 01:43:47,050
my son is a dwarf.

3857
01:43:47,590 --> 01:43:48,423
And I was like,

3858
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:49,593
yeah.

3859
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:51,010
And he started talking and he,

3860
01:43:51,300 --> 01:43:51,721
I go,

3861
01:43:51,721 --> 01:43:52,050
I

3862
01:43:52,050 --> 01:43:52,321
get it,

3863
01:43:52,321 --> 01:43:52,680
man.

3864
01:43:52,680 --> 01:43:53,513
I understand.

3865
01:43:53,670 --> 01:43:53,980
He's like,

3866
01:43:53,980 --> 01:43:54,630
you understand,

3867
01:43:54,630 --> 01:43:55,320
I go,

3868
01:43:55,320 --> 01:43:58,110
I understand how what I
said is offensive to you.

3869
01:43:58,290 --> 01:43:58,651
And he said,

3870
01:43:58,651 --> 01:43:59,640
it's not offensive to me.

3871
01:43:59,670 --> 01:44:02,190
It's offensive to him and
what he's going to become.

3872
01:44:02,910 --> 01:44:03,743
And I was like,

3873
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:05,220
yeah,

3874
01:44:05,220 --> 01:44:05,611
I get it,

3875
01:44:05,611 --> 01:44:06,444
man.

3876
01:44:06,810 --> 01:44:07,860
So the next show,

3877
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:09,241
oh,

3878
01:44:09,241 --> 01:44:10,170
and then after that,

3879
01:44:10,590 --> 01:44:11,550
the fucking,

3880
01:44:11,970 --> 01:44:13,790
the guy went back to see,

3881
01:44:13,820 --> 01:44:14,221
I was like,

3882
01:44:14,221 --> 01:44:15,480
Jesus Christ.

3883
01:44:15,540 --> 01:44:16,440
And I was like,

3884
01:44:16,441 --> 01:44:17,274
that sucked.

3885
01:44:17,730 --> 01:44:21,330
And I was standing out front
and then at the end of the show,

3886
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:21,901
or actually no,

3887
01:44:21,901 --> 01:44:22,681
the show was still going on.

3888
01:44:22,681 --> 01:44:27,681
I saw him and a woman talking to
the manager and she was hysterical,

3889
01:44:30,090 --> 01:44:32,760
like just crying and screaming.

3890
01:44:33,930 --> 01:44:34,710
And I was,

3891
01:44:34,710 --> 01:44:35,910
she didn't know that I was watching.

3892
01:44:35,911 --> 01:44:39,960
I was watching from like
25 feet away and the guy,

3893
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:43,800
she's telling the manager and I can
hear her saying he's such an asshole,

3894
01:44:43,801 --> 01:44:45,150
he's such an asshole.

3895
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:47,880
And I can hear the manager going,

3896
01:44:48,090 --> 01:44:48,960
he's not an asshole,

3897
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:50,250
he's not an asshole.

3898
01:44:50,280 --> 01:44:51,113
He's a nice guy.

3899
01:44:51,330 --> 01:44:52,140
And I was like,

3900
01:44:52,140 --> 01:44:53,520
I couldn't believe that
he was saying that.

3901
01:44:53,880 --> 01:44:55,650
And then he was like,

3902
01:44:55,651 --> 01:44:56,550
I'll tell you what I'll do,

3903
01:44:56,700 --> 01:44:59,220
I'll give you tickets to come back.

3904
01:44:59,670 --> 01:45:02,940
You tell me any show you want to come
to and I'll give you tickets to that.

3905
01:45:03,540 --> 01:45:04,590
And then they were like,

3906
01:45:04,591 --> 01:45:04,981
okay.

3907
01:45:04,981 --> 01:45:08,190
And they were leaving and then
he stopped them and he was like,

3908
01:45:08,340 --> 01:45:09,173
just so you know,

3909
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:11,520
I can't promise you the same shit
won't happen at that next show.

3910
01:45:11,730 --> 01:45:12,563
And they were like,

3911
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:13,433
I guess so.

3912
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:13,981
And then they,

3913
01:45:13,981 --> 01:45:14,814
they left.

3914
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:16,673
Um,

3915
01:45:16,920 --> 01:45:21,920
so I felt badly that I
upset a family and I get,

3916
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:22,521
you know,

3917
01:45:22,521 --> 01:45:23,460
like would upset them.

3918
01:45:23,580 --> 01:45:28,580
But I still think that the joke
for the most part was funny.

3919
01:45:28,980 --> 01:45:30,270
Like I thought it was a funny joke,

3920
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:31,830
the bid or whatever.

3921
01:45:31,860 --> 01:45:34,230
So I kind of thought about it and then,

3922
01:45:35,130 --> 01:45:35,510
you know,

3923
01:45:35,510 --> 01:45:35,751
I like,

3924
01:45:35,751 --> 01:45:37,620
I stopped doing it really out of boredom.

3925
01:45:37,710 --> 01:45:38,560
Not really that I,

3926
01:45:38,980 --> 01:45:40,110
I spent the next show,

3927
01:45:40,111 --> 01:45:41,610
I made a joke about that couple.

3928
01:45:43,710 --> 01:45:46,190
I told him how the lady got
upset at me and I was like,

3929
01:45:46,191 --> 01:45:47,220
Hey lady,

3930
01:45:47,221 --> 01:45:47,730
that joke,

3931
01:45:47,730 --> 01:45:48,031
I'm not,

3932
01:45:48,031 --> 01:45:49,380
the one that fills you
up was spoiled milk.

3933
01:45:49,381 --> 01:45:50,101
Don't get mad at me.

3934
01:45:50,101 --> 01:45:51,810
Did you say on stage?

3935
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:52,321
Oh,

3936
01:45:52,321 --> 01:45:53,250
that's fucked up.

3937
01:45:55,350 --> 01:45:58,530
But I mean it wasn't that
familiar with spoiled little girl.

3938
01:45:58,560 --> 01:45:59,393
It's so wrong.

3939
01:45:59,490 --> 01:46:01,310
But I really feel like it's,

3940
01:46:01,311 --> 01:46:01,951
it goes back to,

3941
01:46:01,951 --> 01:46:02,671
we were talking about,

3942
01:46:02,671 --> 01:46:03,031
I mean,

3943
01:46:03,031 --> 01:46:06,600
and I realized that it's super subjective
and people can definitely tell me that

3944
01:46:06,601 --> 01:46:07,800
that joke is not funny.

3945
01:46:07,830 --> 01:46:08,610
I respect that.

3946
01:46:08,610 --> 01:46:09,061
I'm not,

3947
01:46:09,061 --> 01:46:09,894
I'm not in the,

3948
01:46:10,230 --> 01:46:14,370
I don't take the position as I'm going
to argue with you about how things are

3949
01:46:14,371 --> 01:46:16,140
funny or something that I said.

3950
01:46:16,830 --> 01:46:18,270
I'm just saying that when I said it,

3951
01:46:18,510 --> 01:46:21,180
I thought it was funny that
that's what I'm going out on.

3952
01:46:21,420 --> 01:46:22,830
I thought when I said it was funny,

3953
01:46:23,150 --> 01:46:23,380
uh,

3954
01:46:23,380 --> 01:46:25,650
there are jokes that I've
done in the past that I go,

3955
01:46:26,190 --> 01:46:27,030
those are just,

3956
01:46:27,210 --> 01:46:27,480
yeah.

3957
01:46:27,480 --> 01:46:29,250
I mean some of course are easy jokes.

3958
01:46:29,251 --> 01:46:32,310
Some are really just jokes that
I get bored of saying it's,

3959
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:32,860
it's,

3960
01:46:32,860 --> 01:46:36,240
it's not funny to me anymore now because
I didn't think it was a funny thing at

3961
01:46:36,241 --> 01:46:36,770
first.

3962
01:46:36,770 --> 01:46:38,100
We were just bored of it.

3963
01:46:38,130 --> 01:46:38,320
Yeah.

3964
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:39,060
I got bored of it,

3965
01:46:39,060 --> 01:46:39,930
so I stopped saying it.

3966
01:46:40,380 --> 01:46:40,621
Yeah.

3967
01:46:40,621 --> 01:46:42,150
And there's stop with this.

3968
01:46:42,200 --> 01:46:42,800
You don't like it?

3969
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:43,170
No,

3970
01:46:43,170 --> 01:46:44,220
I don't want this shit.

3971
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:45,010
Um,

3972
01:46:45,010 --> 01:46:45,843
why?

3973
01:46:46,030 --> 01:46:47,850
It's like when you,

3974
01:46:47,851 --> 01:46:49,110
when you create a bit,

3975
01:46:49,150 --> 01:46:49,391
you know,

3976
01:46:49,391 --> 01:46:50,170
when you have a bit

3977
01:46:50,170 --> 01:46:52,250
and you do a bit that's
like super controversial.

3978
01:46:52,350 --> 01:46:52,870
Yes.

3979
01:46:52,870 --> 01:46:55,600
We are essentially doing is you're
establishing your parameters.

3980
01:46:55,601 --> 01:46:57,790
Like know if you're
going to go see my show,

3981
01:46:57,940 --> 01:46:59,650
you're going to get this.

3982
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:00,833
You might get this,

3983
01:47:01,330 --> 01:47:02,530
it goes this far.

3984
01:47:02,620 --> 01:47:02,860
Right,

3985
01:47:02,860 --> 01:47:06,360
and there's certain guys
that you know that like you,

3986
01:47:06,361 --> 01:47:07,690
you know when you go see them,

3987
01:47:07,870 --> 01:47:10,390
they're basically not going to
talk about anything controversial.

3988
01:47:10,510 --> 01:47:12,310
They're not going to say
anything mean or cruel.

3989
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:12,701
They're not.

3990
01:47:12,701 --> 01:47:14,410
And so you know that guy's parameters too,

3991
01:47:14,440 --> 01:47:14,740
right?

3992
01:47:14,740 --> 01:47:16,540
Like if you go see Jerry
Seinfeld for instance,

3993
01:47:16,720 --> 01:47:19,000
you're not going to get a whole
lot of ass to mouth jokes.

3994
01:47:19,660 --> 01:47:24,660
Jerry Seinfeld is dropped so many of
his ATM until imagine if he's like,

3995
01:47:24,911 --> 01:47:28,420
if you got divorced and just
started doing ecstasy and hit well,

3996
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:30,010
I realize I'm almost dead.

3997
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:34,880
So a and I'm ranch so I
only go asked him out.

3998
01:47:36,550 --> 01:47:37,390
I don't want to talk to them.

3999
01:47:38,470 --> 01:47:40,900
Why would I talk to you
when she'll go ask them out?

4000
01:47:41,470 --> 01:47:42,400
You explained it to me.

4001
01:47:42,430 --> 01:47:42,851
You'd say,

4002
01:47:42,851 --> 01:47:44,230
I'm stupid Jesus.

4003
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:46,710
She'll go ass to mouth and
you won't put it in her ass.

4004
01:47:46,730 --> 01:47:47,740
He was like simple math.

4005
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:49,480
I just put it in her mouth.

4006
01:47:50,140 --> 01:47:52,630
Why are we arguing when I can
just be driving a Porsche?

4007
01:47:53,740 --> 01:47:53,981
Yeah.

4008
01:47:53,981 --> 01:47:54,730
I mean,

4009
01:47:54,730 --> 01:47:55,930
you know that you go see him,

4010
01:47:55,931 --> 01:47:57,700
you're not going to get a midget joke,

4011
01:47:57,730 --> 01:47:58,690
you're not going to get some.

4012
01:47:58,740 --> 01:47:59,320
Yeah.

4013
01:47:59,320 --> 01:48:02,650
But this part of like establishing,

4014
01:48:02,980 --> 01:48:07,220
establishing yourself as a comic is
you got to know like who's going to say

4015
01:48:07,221 --> 01:48:08,080
fucked up shit.

4016
01:48:08,230 --> 01:48:10,540
And the comedians that
say fucked up shit to me,

4017
01:48:11,170 --> 01:48:12,550
even if I don't laugh at it,

4018
01:48:12,580 --> 01:48:15,070
like I'm not particularly
fond of midget jokes,

4019
01:48:15,400 --> 01:48:20,400
but I love the fact that a guy is
going to do a joke about anything.

4020
01:48:21,011 --> 01:48:23,080
You're not going to worry
about pissing people off.

4021
01:48:23,081 --> 01:48:24,970
You're just going to do fucked up what?

4022
01:48:24,971 --> 01:48:29,050
And so like you're in a certain
frequency that I enjoy comedy wise.

4023
01:48:29,051 --> 01:48:30,250
Like if I was just a fan,

4024
01:48:30,251 --> 01:48:31,270
if I wasn't a comedian,

4025
01:48:31,271 --> 01:48:32,530
I would totally go see you.

4026
01:48:32,770 --> 01:48:37,770
I'd be psyched because of that element
of danger because of that element of,

4027
01:48:39,070 --> 01:48:39,700
you know,

4028
01:48:39,700 --> 01:48:40,890
fucked up Agnes.

4029
01:48:41,110 --> 01:48:41,680
Yeah,

4030
01:48:41,680 --> 01:48:41,950
no,

4031
01:48:41,950 --> 01:48:42,783
that's an expense.

4032
01:48:43,090 --> 01:48:43,601
But it isn't it.

4033
01:48:43,601 --> 01:48:46,450
I mean it's like I don't
you feel the same way,

4034
01:48:46,670 --> 01:48:48,610
like your favorite kind
of comedy we watch,

4035
01:48:48,611 --> 01:48:48,960
right?

4036
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:49,141
I mean,

4037
01:48:49,141 --> 01:48:50,040
it's why I think I,

4038
01:48:50,100 --> 01:48:50,880
I mean,

4039
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:54,540
I got into comedy because I
love comedy and the guy's like,

4040
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:55,860
I always say it and it,

4041
01:48:55,890 --> 01:48:56,723
I guess it's not,

4042
01:48:56,760 --> 01:48:57,210
it's not,

4043
01:48:57,210 --> 01:48:58,140
it's not entirely fair.

4044
01:48:58,141 --> 01:48:58,890
And I'm aware of that,

4045
01:48:58,890 --> 01:49:00,150
but in my mind,

4046
01:49:00,151 --> 01:49:04,920
what I say to people who as a fan
who don't do things like that,

4047
01:49:05,420 --> 01:49:05,730
um,

4048
01:49:05,730 --> 01:49:06,810
I just in my mind go,

4049
01:49:06,811 --> 01:49:06,931
well,

4050
01:49:06,931 --> 01:49:07,830
I'm going to be bored.

4051
01:49:07,930 --> 01:49:08,200
Yeah.

4052
01:49:08,200 --> 01:49:08,820
I'm going to be bored.

4053
01:49:08,820 --> 01:49:11,430
I want to see somebody
do something fucked up,

4054
01:49:11,460 --> 01:49:12,420
top about fucked up shit.

4055
01:49:12,421 --> 01:49:12,871
I want to talk,

4056
01:49:12,871 --> 01:49:17,871
I want to hear jokes about drugs and sex
and fucked up thing because that's what

4057
01:49:18,031 --> 01:49:18,720
makes me laugh.

4058
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:19,030
Yeah.

4059
01:49:19,030 --> 01:49:20,790
So that's why I want to see,

4060
01:49:20,820 --> 01:49:23,370
and I want to see people
that work in that circle.

4061
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:24,233
That's what interests me.

4062
01:49:24,380 --> 01:49:24,651
Yeah.

4063
01:49:24,651 --> 01:49:25,800
That's all that interesting too.

4064
01:49:25,820 --> 01:49:27,230
And for the longest time,

4065
01:49:27,290 --> 01:49:27,770
uh,

4066
01:49:27,770 --> 01:49:30,710
I was told that that was
the wrong kind of comedy.

4067
01:49:31,010 --> 01:49:34,610
I was told that you shouldn't do that
kind of comedy because it's cheap and easy

4068
01:49:34,611 --> 01:49:35,001
jokes.

4069
01:49:35,001 --> 01:49:35,391
But I was like,

4070
01:49:35,391 --> 01:49:35,841
but God,

4071
01:49:35,841 --> 01:49:36,890
that's what I want to hear.

4072
01:49:36,920 --> 01:49:37,161
That's what,

4073
01:49:37,161 --> 01:49:37,251
yeah,

4074
01:49:37,251 --> 01:49:37,821
that's what you're like,

4075
01:49:37,821 --> 01:49:39,620
when I knew a guy was coming into town,

4076
01:49:39,621 --> 01:49:39,831
when I,

4077
01:49:39,831 --> 01:49:41,770
when I remember when I
first started doing standup,

4078
01:49:41,810 --> 01:49:45,530
I went to see like a bunch of
stand ups when I first started.

4079
01:49:45,531 --> 01:49:45,870
Like what the,

4080
01:49:45,870 --> 01:49:50,170
for my first year of comedy I was real
lucky because that at that time in Boston

4081
01:49:50,320 --> 01:49:52,510
there was a couple big national clubs.

4082
01:49:52,660 --> 01:49:54,520
There wasn't a lot of
national clubs back then.

4083
01:49:54,521 --> 01:49:56,140
Like there was an Improv in New York,

4084
01:49:56,230 --> 01:49:59,980
but there wasn't even an Improv it
in la yet or not an Improv in la.

4085
01:50:00,070 --> 01:50:01,720
There wasn't even an Improv Boston yet.

4086
01:50:02,110 --> 01:50:07,110
It was an Improv in New York and Improv
in La and the Boston one opened I think

4087
01:50:08,381 --> 01:50:13,330
in like 89 or 90 or
something along those lines.

4088
01:50:13,331 --> 01:50:13,780
Yeah.

4089
01:50:13,780 --> 01:50:18,730
So like the guys who were like wanting
to work in like in travel the country,

4090
01:50:18,760 --> 01:50:21,100
there wasn't as many
options as there is now.

4091
01:50:21,220 --> 01:50:24,610
So we would get like top level
headliners in every week.

4092
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:27,310
Like catch a rising star and Cambridge,

4093
01:50:27,550 --> 01:50:28,383
I don't even know.

4094
01:50:28,870 --> 01:50:29,651
I think it's under,

4095
01:50:29,651 --> 01:50:30,401
I think it went under,

4096
01:50:30,401 --> 01:50:31,980
which is God damn shame.

4097
01:50:31,990 --> 01:50:33,400
Cause I went to see,

4098
01:50:33,401 --> 01:50:35,080
I saw Kevin Meeney there.

4099
01:50:35,350 --> 01:50:36,170
I saw that was,

4100
01:50:36,170 --> 01:50:37,270
I was in high school.

4101
01:50:37,330 --> 01:50:38,470
I just graduated high school.

4102
01:50:38,471 --> 01:50:39,580
When I saw Kevin me there,

4103
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:41,500
I saw a rich Jenny there.

4104
01:50:41,680 --> 01:50:46,360
I saw so many comics that were like
big name headliners come through and I

4105
01:50:46,420 --> 01:50:48,610
always enjoyed it when
they were fucked up.

4106
01:50:48,760 --> 01:50:51,880
I remember I would go way out of my way
if I knew that a guy was going to do

4107
01:50:51,881 --> 01:50:52,810
some crazy shit.

4108
01:50:53,050 --> 01:50:53,440
Yeah,

4109
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:55,660
talk about some crazy shit if it went,

4110
01:50:55,770 --> 01:50:57,520
went nutty and if it didn't go nutty.

4111
01:50:57,521 --> 01:50:58,354
I understood.

4112
01:50:58,390 --> 01:50:59,470
I understood it didn't,

4113
01:50:59,680 --> 01:51:02,410
but I was so I would get a giddy joy.

4114
01:51:02,740 --> 01:51:04,600
It's like Doug Stan hope was doing,

4115
01:51:04,900 --> 01:51:06,820
have you heard his new bit
about fantasy football?

4116
01:51:08,350 --> 01:51:09,183
Phenomenal.

4117
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:11,230
It's so fucked up.

4118
01:51:11,710 --> 01:51:12,251
First of all,

4119
01:51:12,251 --> 01:51:15,820
Doug's crowd is so much
different than my crowd.

4120
01:51:16,120 --> 01:51:17,230
They're very different.

4121
01:51:17,560 --> 01:51:19,860
They're very different and they're there.

4122
01:51:19,930 --> 01:51:20,261
There's,

4123
01:51:20,261 --> 01:51:21,670
I mean there's a lot of crossover,

4124
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:27,000
but his fucking people are ham or
really hammer and talking through.

4125
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,160
I mean they were so loud.

4126
01:51:30,200 --> 01:51:32,230
It was w we went to see him at Cincinnati.

4127
01:51:32,231 --> 01:51:33,880
We went to go in and I did,

4128
01:51:33,940 --> 01:51:34,121
yeah,

4129
01:51:34,121 --> 01:51:37,000
we did our show at the Taft and
then we came over to go bananas.

4130
01:51:37,700 --> 01:51:37,990
Oh,

4131
01:51:37,990 --> 01:51:39,520
we had a great fucking time go down.

4132
01:51:39,521 --> 01:51:40,450
This is awesome shit.

4133
01:51:40,451 --> 01:51:42,970
And then we went to Mc Levy's,

4134
01:51:42,971 --> 01:51:46,760
we went next door to the bar and standup
and I were bartending you bartender too

4135
01:51:46,780 --> 01:51:47,110
for awhile,

4136
01:51:47,110 --> 01:51:47,560
didn't you?

4137
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:48,880
I bartended for a half hour.

4138
01:51:48,881 --> 01:51:49,810
I was still bartending.

4139
01:51:49,811 --> 01:51:50,351
You guys are gone.

4140
01:51:50,351 --> 01:51:50,591
I'm like,

4141
01:51:50,591 --> 01:51:50,831
wait,

4142
01:51:50,831 --> 01:51:51,730
why am I doing this?

4143
01:51:53,380 --> 01:51:53,621
Yeah,

4144
01:51:53,621 --> 01:51:56,440
we were handing out drinks and
giving away drinks for free.

4145
01:51:56,620 --> 01:52:01,030
I would give away like 10 drinks and then
I would just take 100 bucks and throw

4146
01:52:01,031 --> 01:52:01,361
it in the,

4147
01:52:01,361 --> 01:52:02,194
in the the uh,

4148
01:52:02,350 --> 01:52:02,771
tip bear.

4149
01:52:02,771 --> 01:52:03,011
I'm like,

4150
01:52:03,011 --> 01:52:03,844
I don't know.

4151
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:04,331
I go,

4152
01:52:04,331 --> 01:52:05,860
I don't know how much this stuff costs,

4153
01:52:05,861 --> 01:52:08,440
so I'm just giving people booze and
I'll just come and start paying for it.

4154
01:52:08,650 --> 01:52:10,210
So I would give people,

4155
01:52:10,211 --> 01:52:10,391
I would,

4156
01:52:10,391 --> 01:52:13,040
I was giving out free drinks and then
I would throw money in that bucket.

4157
01:52:13,220 --> 01:52:13,660
I was like,

4158
01:52:13,660 --> 01:52:14,890
I don't know if it evens out.

4159
01:52:15,250 --> 01:52:19,180
Like we were in Australia and you bought
everybody that ever walked into a bar,

4160
01:52:19,181 --> 01:52:20,014
a drink.

4161
01:52:20,350 --> 01:52:21,850
We went off in Australia.

4162
01:52:22,030 --> 01:52:26,230
That was one of the few times in my life
where we purposely decided to go deep.

4163
01:52:26,530 --> 01:52:26,741
Yeah.

4164
01:52:26,741 --> 01:52:27,430
That was pretty fun.

4165
01:52:27,430 --> 01:52:27,761
We,

4166
01:52:27,761 --> 01:52:29,830
me and Tommy and Eddie Bravo,

4167
01:52:29,950 --> 01:52:33,700
we were in Sydney and we
went to the movies when we
were super disappointed with

4168
01:52:33,701 --> 01:52:35,830
that stupid fucking island.

4169
01:52:35,831 --> 01:52:36,550
Shutter island.

4170
01:52:36,550 --> 01:52:36,821
Yeah.

4171
01:52:36,821 --> 01:52:38,020
Leonardo di Caprio.

4172
01:52:38,110 --> 01:52:38,860
Oh,

4173
01:52:38,860 --> 01:52:39,401
psych.

4174
01:52:39,401 --> 01:52:40,570
None of this actually happened.

4175
01:52:40,571 --> 01:52:41,560
I'm actually crazy.

4176
01:52:41,960 --> 01:52:42,400
Ah,

4177
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:44,290
we were so angry and we're angry.

4178
01:52:44,291 --> 01:52:45,890
It's so many people that weren't angry.

4179
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:47,420
That was one that was more upsetting.

4180
01:52:47,690 --> 01:52:48,950
That was way more upsetting.

4181
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:49,660
Somebody.

4182
01:52:49,660 --> 01:52:50,780
People like that movie.

4183
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:51,110
Yeah.

4184
01:52:51,110 --> 01:52:52,940
So we decided to go to Taiwan on,

4185
01:52:53,120 --> 01:52:56,510
and we went to this local bar and uh,

4186
01:52:56,600 --> 01:52:57,433
it just,

4187
01:52:57,650 --> 01:52:58,910
it just started,

4188
01:52:59,120 --> 01:52:59,770
you know,

4189
01:52:59,770 --> 01:52:59,950
we,

4190
01:52:59,950 --> 01:53:00,231
we,

4191
01:53:00,231 --> 01:53:01,700
we got some shots we made,

4192
01:53:01,701 --> 01:53:04,040
so we met some friends and
they made some friends,

4193
01:53:04,041 --> 01:53:05,210
some nice people that were there,

4194
01:53:05,300 --> 01:53:06,470
wanted to take a couple of pictures.

4195
01:53:06,470 --> 01:53:07,303
We took a pictures,

4196
01:53:07,460 --> 01:53:09,290
and then when somebody
wanted to take a picture,

4197
01:53:09,291 --> 01:53:09,501
I'm like,

4198
01:53:09,501 --> 01:53:10,131
come on mother fucker.

4199
01:53:10,131 --> 01:53:10,641
You want to drink?

4200
01:53:10,641 --> 01:53:11,770
Let's trank cause come on with drinking.

4201
01:53:11,800 --> 01:53:13,520
You weren't and I just pointed
people you want to drink,

4202
01:53:13,820 --> 01:53:14,570
you want to know who's in,

4203
01:53:14,570 --> 01:53:14,961
who's in.

4204
01:53:14,961 --> 01:53:15,970
Are you guys in WWE?

4205
01:53:16,030 --> 01:53:18,170
I was buying drinks for
2030 people at a time.

4206
01:53:18,171 --> 01:53:18,800
Like the wages,

4207
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:23,800
super stacking trays of shots and like
just giant group of people were all like

4208
01:53:23,871 --> 01:53:25,760
cheering and dragon by the way.

4209
01:53:25,820 --> 01:53:27,410
There's nothing after that experience.

4210
01:53:27,411 --> 01:53:31,280
That's the coolest way you can ever spend
your first night in a foreign country.

4211
01:53:31,410 --> 01:53:31,660
Oh.

4212
01:53:31,660 --> 01:53:33,680
Like thank you for having
me in your country.

4213
01:53:34,040 --> 01:53:35,090
Everybody gets drinks.

4214
01:53:35,480 --> 01:53:36,620
That was the most fucking fun.

4215
01:53:36,650 --> 01:53:39,530
I spend more money in that bar
than I've ever spent in a bar.

4216
01:53:39,650 --> 01:53:40,490
I hope so.

4217
01:53:40,520 --> 01:53:40,790
Yeah,

4218
01:53:40,790 --> 01:53:41,810
it was thousands of dollars,

4219
01:53:42,650 --> 01:53:43,520
but it was so fun.

4220
01:53:43,610 --> 01:53:47,150
You were nice enough to tell people
we've been buying people drinks all night

4221
01:53:47,750 --> 01:53:48,770
when we walked out.

4222
01:53:48,790 --> 01:53:49,910
Like now we have it.

4223
01:53:50,180 --> 01:53:51,460
He's been buying people's drinks.

4224
01:53:51,890 --> 01:53:52,521
I brought 50.

4225
01:53:52,521 --> 01:53:53,354
Dot.

4226
01:53:54,380 --> 01:53:55,430
While we were all together.

4227
01:53:55,431 --> 01:53:56,060
So it's we,

4228
01:53:56,060 --> 01:53:56,340
yeah,

4229
01:53:56,340 --> 01:53:57,021
that was fun,

4230
01:53:57,021 --> 01:53:57,530
man.

4231
01:53:57,530 --> 01:53:58,340
It was the way to do it.

4232
01:53:58,340 --> 01:53:58,571
I mean,

4233
01:53:58,571 --> 01:53:58,640
yeah,

4234
01:53:58,640 --> 01:53:59,760
cause it was like we,

4235
01:53:59,800 --> 01:54:00,111
we,

4236
01:54:00,111 --> 01:54:00,770
you know,

4237
01:54:00,770 --> 01:54:01,370
when we were,

4238
01:54:01,370 --> 01:54:02,480
when you're all drunk,

4239
01:54:02,660 --> 01:54:03,010
okay.

4240
01:54:03,010 --> 01:54:04,010
When everybody's drunk,

4241
01:54:04,310 --> 01:54:05,780
when you're dealing with 20,

4242
01:54:05,781 --> 01:54:06,320
30,

4243
01:54:06,320 --> 01:54:07,670
I mean how many people
were there at the end?

4244
01:54:08,490 --> 01:54:09,520
We had a lot of people who are doing,

4245
01:54:10,360 --> 01:54:10,700
yeah,

4246
01:54:10,700 --> 01:54:11,810
there's hundreds of people,

4247
01:54:11,811 --> 01:54:12,290
Dude.

4248
01:54:12,290 --> 01:54:13,430
And we're high fiving people.

4249
01:54:13,610 --> 01:54:15,830
But we made sure that
everyone was fucked up.

4250
01:54:15,860 --> 01:54:16,100
Yeah.

4251
01:54:16,100 --> 01:54:17,630
So we were all in the same boat of course.

4252
01:54:17,660 --> 01:54:18,810
And everyone was very friendly,

4253
01:54:19,120 --> 01:54:23,330
was happy and everybody was friendly
and people were all like huggy high five

4254
01:54:23,331 --> 01:54:24,170
take a picture,

4255
01:54:24,171 --> 01:54:24,381
you know,

4256
01:54:24,381 --> 01:54:26,960
they were all friendly and
the waiters were happy.

4257
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:28,010
The bartenders were happy,

4258
01:54:28,011 --> 01:54:28,940
they were all laughing.

4259
01:54:29,090 --> 01:54:32,000
It's like the fact that you can
make a moment like that happen,

4260
01:54:32,240 --> 01:54:34,130
but God damn did I pay
for it the next day.

4261
01:54:35,110 --> 01:54:36,030
Ooh.

4262
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:37,190
Give business manager call.

4263
01:54:37,220 --> 01:54:37,671
Hey,

4264
01:54:37,671 --> 01:54:38,504
what happened?

4265
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:38,900
No,

4266
01:54:38,900 --> 01:54:39,590
I'm my head.

4267
01:54:39,590 --> 01:54:39,771
No,

4268
01:54:39,771 --> 01:54:40,000
I did.

4269
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,630
The money was well spent with my,

4270
01:54:41,631 --> 01:54:43,310
my dome was fucking pounds.

4271
01:54:43,820 --> 01:54:48,560
That's the shit thing to do too because
the next day like I had a really fire up

4272
01:54:48,561 --> 01:54:49,371
to do this show.

4273
01:54:49,371 --> 01:54:51,200
I was like noticeably slower,

4274
01:54:51,570 --> 01:54:52,130
you know?

4275
01:54:52,130 --> 01:54:55,610
And I think I was probably even noticeably
like slow the next day when the UFC

4276
01:54:55,611 --> 01:54:56,150
was on.

4277
01:54:56,150 --> 01:54:56,451
Really?

4278
01:54:56,451 --> 01:54:56,720
It's like,

4279
01:54:56,720 --> 01:54:57,051
yeah,

4280
01:54:57,051 --> 01:54:57,920
probably man,

4281
01:54:57,921 --> 01:54:58,820
I got drunk.

4282
01:54:58,821 --> 01:55:00,500
I mean that was pretty God damn drunk.

4283
01:55:00,830 --> 01:55:04,080
You can't get that drunk and
bounce bounce right back here.

4284
01:55:04,081 --> 01:55:09,081
Also that drunk coming off of that
flight 16 hours or whatever it is.

4285
01:55:09,231 --> 01:55:09,800
Yeah.

4286
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:10,580
And then,

4287
01:55:10,580 --> 01:55:12,220
but then we didn't like our bodies.

4288
01:55:12,370 --> 01:55:15,560
I already went past like when
we should have gone to bed,

4289
01:55:15,590 --> 01:55:18,080
which probably like I know where like
in the early evening or something,

4290
01:55:18,620 --> 01:55:21,170
we rolled that out into late night there.

4291
01:55:21,230 --> 01:55:21,560
Yeah,

4292
01:55:21,560 --> 01:55:24,830
we did like a full day and change over.

4293
01:55:24,860 --> 01:55:27,800
They say you should do that
though to avoid like to,

4294
01:55:27,801 --> 01:55:28,910
to reset your clock.

4295
01:55:29,270 --> 01:55:31,580
They say just have one day
where you just stay up,

4296
01:55:31,581 --> 01:55:32,160
stay up,

4297
01:55:32,160 --> 01:55:32,631
stay up.

4298
01:55:32,631 --> 01:55:36,670
So that way when you know 10:00
PM the right time rolls around,

4299
01:55:36,710 --> 01:55:38,390
you're going to be so fucking tired.

4300
01:55:38,630 --> 01:55:39,020
You know,

4301
01:55:39,020 --> 01:55:40,490
if you could just power through.

4302
01:55:40,640 --> 01:55:42,890
But if you take a nap
you could fuck the whole,

4303
01:55:43,120 --> 01:55:43,570
yeah.

4304
01:55:43,570 --> 01:55:45,250
Well I've had that where
you wake up and you're like,

4305
01:55:45,251 --> 01:55:45,970
we're the fucking marine.

4306
01:55:45,970 --> 01:55:47,730
Like really scared for a moment like that.

4307
01:55:47,750 --> 01:55:48,850
You don't know where you are.

4308
01:55:48,910 --> 01:55:49,290
Yeah.

4309
01:55:49,290 --> 01:55:49,450
Yeah.

4310
01:55:49,450 --> 01:55:50,500
I had that happen before.

4311
01:55:50,650 --> 01:55:54,220
The worst is when you're in England and
he can't go to bed till like 6:00 AM

4312
01:55:54,760 --> 01:55:57,000
because it's eight hours
ahead or something done.

4313
01:55:57,040 --> 01:55:57,270
Right.

4314
01:55:57,270 --> 01:55:57,490
Right.

4315
01:55:57,490 --> 01:55:58,360
Was all of us.

4316
01:55:58,420 --> 01:55:58,711
Yeah.

4317
01:55:58,711 --> 01:56:00,550
It's probably like in the seven,

4318
01:56:00,551 --> 01:56:02,260
eight some Australia was like a whole day.

4319
01:56:02,290 --> 01:56:02,891
It's all day.

4320
01:56:02,891 --> 01:56:03,370
Yeah.

4321
01:56:03,370 --> 01:56:04,930
Which has even nuttier.

4322
01:56:05,010 --> 01:56:05,380
Yeah.

4323
01:56:05,380 --> 01:56:06,160
You know,

4324
01:56:06,160 --> 01:56:06,550
that's,

4325
01:56:06,550 --> 01:56:07,121
that's a,

4326
01:56:07,121 --> 01:56:07,954
that's a bizarre,

4327
01:56:08,260 --> 01:56:09,190
I did South Africa,

4328
01:56:09,191 --> 01:56:11,050
that was like a half,

4329
01:56:11,650 --> 01:56:13,240
I think it's like 12 hour difference.

4330
01:56:13,241 --> 01:56:13,871
It's pretty great.

4331
01:56:13,871 --> 01:56:14,740
Like it throws you over.

4332
01:56:16,060 --> 01:56:16,780
Yeah.

4333
01:56:16,780 --> 01:56:19,120
How many hours is that flight?

4334
01:56:19,570 --> 01:56:20,860
It was from Atlanta.

4335
01:56:21,160 --> 01:56:22,150
They do a direct,

4336
01:56:22,350 --> 01:56:22,660
uh,

4337
01:56:22,660 --> 01:56:25,450
15 and change to South Africa.

4338
01:56:25,700 --> 01:56:27,430
You Act from Atlanta?

4339
01:56:27,630 --> 01:56:28,180
Yeah.

4340
01:56:28,180 --> 01:56:29,013
How long were you there for?

4341
01:56:29,590 --> 01:56:31,270
Two and almost three weeks.

4342
01:56:31,750 --> 01:56:31,961
Oh,

4343
01:56:31,961 --> 01:56:32,770
Jesus.

4344
01:56:32,770 --> 01:56:33,310
Yeah.

4345
01:56:33,310 --> 01:56:33,900
It was great.

4346
01:56:33,900 --> 01:56:35,140
I was it God.

4347
01:56:35,170 --> 01:56:35,800
Yeah.

4348
01:56:35,800 --> 01:56:36,490
Fantastic.

4349
01:56:36,490 --> 01:56:37,570
Really loved it.

4350
01:56:37,600 --> 01:56:37,840
Yeah.

4351
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:38,710
What was so great about it?

4352
01:56:39,220 --> 01:56:39,640
Um,

4353
01:56:39,640 --> 01:56:40,031
everything.

4354
01:56:40,031 --> 01:56:44,190
I mean people were so god Damn
Nice and friendly and appreciative.

4355
01:56:44,210 --> 01:56:45,970
The shows were all fantastic.

4356
01:56:46,450 --> 01:56:47,620
We got treated great.

4357
01:56:47,860 --> 01:56:48,700
It was a,

4358
01:56:48,760 --> 01:56:49,391
it was a blast,

4359
01:56:49,391 --> 01:56:49,541
man.

4360
01:56:49,541 --> 01:56:52,390
So did you have any prejudices
about going to Africa?

4361
01:56:53,230 --> 01:56:53,621
Not really.

4362
01:56:53,621 --> 01:56:53,891
I mean,

4363
01:56:53,891 --> 01:56:55,840
I knew that like once it was booked,

4364
01:56:56,320 --> 01:56:56,700
um,

4365
01:56:56,700 --> 01:56:58,450
the only thing that I had,

4366
01:56:58,451 --> 01:56:59,470
you have to think about,

4367
01:56:59,860 --> 01:57:00,693
uh,

4368
01:57:00,720 --> 01:57:01,090
you know,

4369
01:57:01,090 --> 01:57:02,140
his disease stuff,

4370
01:57:02,141 --> 01:57:03,610
so you have to get certain shots.

4371
01:57:03,610 --> 01:57:04,360
But like,

4372
01:57:04,360 --> 01:57:05,260
I thought it was gonna be fun.

4373
01:57:05,261 --> 01:57:09,730
I'd heard good things about doing like
standup in South Africa for a while now,

4374
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:11,350
so I was totally excited to go.

4375
01:57:11,380 --> 01:57:14,110
I'm all about anywhere
I get an offer abroad.

4376
01:57:14,140 --> 01:57:14,973
I think that's,

4377
01:57:15,010 --> 01:57:15,730
to me it's not,

4378
01:57:15,730 --> 01:57:16,563
um,

4379
01:57:16,720 --> 01:57:18,070
I get excited about it really.

4380
01:57:18,071 --> 01:57:19,090
Why do you want to get excited?

4381
01:57:19,330 --> 01:57:20,170
I just think it's fun,

4382
01:57:20,171 --> 01:57:20,411
man.

4383
01:57:20,411 --> 01:57:20,951
I mean like my,

4384
01:57:20,951 --> 01:57:25,951
it's my job and then somebody would want
to see me do this like thousands of,

4385
01:57:26,201 --> 01:57:27,430
I like checking out places,

4386
01:57:27,431 --> 01:57:29,410
so it's fun to go to Australia.

4387
01:57:29,411 --> 01:57:31,210
It's fun to go to South Africa,

4388
01:57:31,240 --> 01:57:31,511
England.

4389
01:57:31,511 --> 01:57:32,440
Like that's all I entertaining.

4390
01:57:32,441 --> 01:57:32,740
To me.

4391
01:57:32,740 --> 01:57:33,240
It's fun.

4392
01:57:33,240 --> 01:57:34,590
I just remembered your opening joke.

4393
01:57:34,630 --> 01:57:35,463
Where in Australia?

4394
01:57:37,090 --> 01:57:37,980
Can you remember it?

4395
01:57:38,250 --> 01:57:38,910
Yeah.

4396
01:57:38,910 --> 01:57:39,450
Uh,

4397
01:57:39,450 --> 01:57:39,721
no.

4398
01:57:39,721 --> 01:57:43,680
What was it about being on the plane for
so long that you think you're trimming?

4399
01:57:44,010 --> 01:57:44,843
Oh yeah.

4400
01:57:45,420 --> 01:57:46,200
Am I dead?

4401
01:57:46,200 --> 01:57:46,801
Like well,

4402
01:57:46,801 --> 01:57:47,634
right.

4403
01:57:48,030 --> 01:57:48,540
Yeah.

4404
01:57:48,540 --> 01:57:48,740
Oh,

4405
01:57:48,740 --> 01:57:49,573
I remember there was a bit,

4406
01:57:49,860 --> 01:57:50,370
yeah.

4407
01:57:50,370 --> 01:57:51,040
I mean,

4408
01:57:51,040 --> 01:57:51,890
then they get it.

4409
01:57:51,900 --> 01:57:52,350
My Dad,

4410
01:57:52,350 --> 01:57:53,610
you'd get off and you said,

4411
01:57:53,790 --> 01:57:53,941
well,

4412
01:57:53,941 --> 01:57:56,010
I must be in heaven because
there's no black people.

4413
01:57:56,220 --> 01:57:57,053
Oh yeah.

4414
01:57:57,090 --> 01:57:57,923
Yeah.

4415
01:57:58,830 --> 01:57:59,663
That was for,

4416
01:57:59,880 --> 01:58:03,210
I was so far as your
opening joke in Sydney.

4417
01:58:03,211 --> 01:58:03,890
Yeah.

4418
01:58:03,890 --> 01:58:04,860
But they light up.

4419
01:58:04,890 --> 01:58:05,011
Oh,

4420
01:58:05,011 --> 01:58:06,150
they troubles Joe.

4421
01:58:06,160 --> 01:58:06,900
It was a joke.

4422
01:58:06,900 --> 01:58:09,420
It's like how you said at the very
beginning and everybody knew it.

4423
01:58:09,450 --> 01:58:10,200
Nobody was like,

4424
01:58:10,200 --> 01:58:11,430
that's fucked up man.

4425
01:58:11,490 --> 01:58:11,701
Like,

4426
01:58:11,701 --> 01:58:12,240
yeah.

4427
01:58:12,240 --> 01:58:12,780
Yeah.

4428
01:58:12,780 --> 01:58:13,590
It was a joke.

4429
01:58:13,590 --> 01:58:14,423
It was funny.

4430
01:58:14,820 --> 01:58:15,481
It was funny.

4431
01:58:15,481 --> 01:58:19,680
And they have a totally different feeling
for black people and then we do as

4432
01:58:19,681 --> 01:58:24,360
well because that's not like
their cultural underclass
or cultural underclass is

4433
01:58:24,361 --> 01:58:26,100
not like former slaves.

4434
01:58:26,101 --> 01:58:27,090
It's aborigines.

4435
01:58:27,130 --> 01:58:27,510
Right.

4436
01:58:27,510 --> 01:58:30,970
It's like a totally different sort of a
holocaust that happened over there told

4437
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:31,833
me the,

4438
01:58:31,900 --> 01:58:36,330
it's like this whole dark
period of American history,

4439
01:58:36,331 --> 01:58:39,150
the shameful period there is a shameful,

4440
01:58:39,151 --> 01:58:41,260
but it's shameful towards
the aborigine people.

4441
01:58:41,261 --> 01:58:42,094
It's totally,

4442
01:58:42,220 --> 01:58:43,420
totally different sort of,

4443
01:58:43,430 --> 01:58:43,780
uh,

4444
01:58:43,780 --> 01:58:44,470
underclass.

4445
01:58:44,470 --> 01:58:45,340
I made a joke there.

4446
01:58:45,341 --> 01:58:46,030
I got that.

4447
01:58:46,030 --> 01:58:49,540
They didn't think it was so funny about
that when I went back and looked up to

4448
01:58:49,550 --> 01:58:50,310
the Auburn,

4449
01:58:50,310 --> 01:58:50,710
but,

4450
01:58:50,710 --> 01:58:51,700
but it was a joke,

4451
01:58:51,701 --> 01:58:52,330
man.

4452
01:58:52,330 --> 01:58:53,890
The Melbourne would be more sensitive.

4453
01:58:54,920 --> 01:58:55,990
They're more sensitive,

4454
01:58:56,020 --> 01:58:57,520
but really it was most sensitive.

4455
01:58:57,560 --> 01:58:58,540
It wasn't really the room,

4456
01:58:58,750 --> 01:59:01,180
it was the press like the
guy writing the review.

4457
01:59:01,840 --> 01:59:03,190
It's not like the room lost it.

4458
01:59:03,220 --> 01:59:03,690
Right.

4459
01:59:03,690 --> 01:59:08,350
Instead it made its way into an article
about how offensive and racist and stuff

4460
01:59:08,351 --> 01:59:08,590
it was.

4461
01:59:08,590 --> 01:59:08,981
You know what I mean?

4462
01:59:08,981 --> 01:59:09,390
Horse.

4463
01:59:09,390 --> 01:59:09,640
Yeah.

4464
01:59:09,640 --> 01:59:10,271
Well most,

4465
01:59:10,271 --> 01:59:12,840
most people that are going to write
articles about something getting,

4466
01:59:12,841 --> 01:59:13,010
yeah.

4467
01:59:13,010 --> 01:59:16,100
Excited to be upset because if I,

4468
01:59:16,140 --> 01:59:19,360
even if we're talking right now and you're
like right about how fucking much you

4469
01:59:19,361 --> 01:59:20,790
hate American Airlines and be like,

4470
01:59:20,791 --> 01:59:21,311
all right,

4471
01:59:21,311 --> 01:59:22,300
here goes a blog.

4472
01:59:22,301 --> 01:59:23,040
Like oh yeah,

4473
01:59:23,040 --> 01:59:25,110
and I can tell you this
story and I just write that.

4474
01:59:25,120 --> 01:59:25,331
Yeah,

4475
01:59:25,331 --> 01:59:25,840
of course.

4476
01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:26,950
Like it's fun to write that.

4477
01:59:27,020 --> 01:59:28,300
Did you read that one?

4478
01:59:28,340 --> 01:59:28,770
Uh,

4479
01:59:28,770 --> 01:59:31,900
there was a broader view of a Guy Fieri,

4480
01:59:31,901 --> 01:59:33,100
whatever the fuck his name is,

4481
01:59:33,160 --> 01:59:34,750
restaurant in Manhattan.

4482
01:59:35,050 --> 01:59:36,220
It was so scathing.

4483
01:59:36,221 --> 01:59:36,431
Yeah.

4484
01:59:36,431 --> 01:59:37,241
It went public.

4485
01:59:37,241 --> 01:59:37,871
Were people like,

4486
01:59:37,871 --> 01:59:38,870
what the fuck?

4487
01:59:38,871 --> 01:59:39,701
Like it was.

4488
01:59:39,701 --> 01:59:41,350
It was such a brutal review.

4489
01:59:41,380 --> 01:59:41,890
Right.

4490
01:59:41,890 --> 01:59:43,270
I wonder how accurate it was.

4491
01:59:43,300 --> 01:59:43,630
Well,

4492
01:59:43,630 --> 01:59:45,290
I wonder how I imagined it.

4493
01:59:45,291 --> 01:59:46,150
It's somewhat accurate,

4494
01:59:46,750 --> 01:59:51,750
but some of the hatred for that restaurant
comes from that guy's feeling about

4495
01:59:52,001 --> 01:59:53,440
God and not the restaurant.

4496
01:59:53,680 --> 01:59:55,110
If you took a guy out of the equation,

4497
01:59:55,120 --> 01:59:55,960
you just send them there.

4498
01:59:56,010 --> 01:59:56,290
Sure.

4499
01:59:56,290 --> 01:59:58,000
It would not be as vicious.

4500
01:59:58,180 --> 01:59:58,710
Yeah,

4501
01:59:58,710 --> 01:59:58,880
no,

4502
01:59:58,880 --> 01:59:59,713
absolutely.

4503
01:59:59,890 --> 02:00:00,670
Yeah,

4504
02:00:00,670 --> 02:00:01,503
absolutely.

4505
02:00:01,550 --> 02:00:01,810
Yeah,

4506
02:00:01,810 --> 02:00:02,340
it's pro,

4507
02:00:02,340 --> 02:00:02,650
well,

4508
02:00:02,650 --> 02:00:03,580
it's also the,

4509
02:00:03,581 --> 02:00:05,110
the hype that comes with that.

4510
02:00:05,111 --> 02:00:05,261
I mean,

4511
02:00:05,261 --> 02:00:06,970
if you want to be a celebrity chef,

4512
02:00:07,210 --> 02:00:10,870
you better knock my dick in the dirt and
I come to your fucking place and to go

4513
02:00:10,871 --> 02:00:12,010
there and to get some,

4514
02:00:12,160 --> 02:00:12,993
you know,

4515
02:00:13,180 --> 02:00:14,940
whack ass Applebee's.

4516
02:00:15,580 --> 02:00:16,301
Apple Mannequins.

4517
02:00:16,301 --> 02:00:17,134
Yeah.

4518
02:00:17,210 --> 02:00:18,043
All right.

4519
02:00:18,770 --> 02:00:19,030
The,

4520
02:00:19,030 --> 02:00:20,380
the whole celebrity chef thing.

4521
02:00:20,381 --> 02:00:21,580
It's a very odd thing.

4522
02:00:21,581 --> 02:00:23,200
And then like all of a sudden,

4523
02:00:23,420 --> 02:00:25,840
and we had Julia child and that was it.

4524
02:00:25,900 --> 02:00:26,260
Yeah.

4525
02:00:26,260 --> 02:00:27,190
For the longest time.

4526
02:00:27,550 --> 02:00:28,361
Who else did we have?

4527
02:00:28,361 --> 02:00:31,840
Who else is celebrity chef was
there a man slept the French,

4528
02:00:31,990 --> 02:00:32,823
the French guy,

4529
02:00:33,130 --> 02:00:34,260
the galloping gourmet.

4530
02:00:34,270 --> 02:00:35,103
Remember that guy?

4531
02:00:35,490 --> 02:00:36,310
Is that,

4532
02:00:36,310 --> 02:00:37,091
I remember the guy who,

4533
02:00:37,091 --> 02:00:38,470
he's been on TV for years now.

4534
02:00:38,530 --> 02:00:39,363
The French guy,

4535
02:00:39,520 --> 02:00:40,353
he's kind of older,

4536
02:00:41,380 --> 02:00:43,360
older French chef.

4537
02:00:43,361 --> 02:00:44,194
I forget his name,

4538
02:00:44,950 --> 02:00:45,783
but he's been on,

4539
02:00:47,160 --> 02:00:47,470
well,

4540
02:00:47,470 --> 02:00:47,830
whatever.

4541
02:00:47,830 --> 02:00:48,663
I mean it's everyone.

4542
02:00:49,180 --> 02:00:53,620
It's a fascinating thing because
it's like all you had was like a,

4543
02:00:54,070 --> 02:00:59,070
like a couple of examples and
then Wolfgang puck got famous.

4544
02:01:00,010 --> 02:01:00,720
That's right.

4545
02:01:00,720 --> 02:01:01,030
He's,

4546
02:01:01,030 --> 02:01:02,200
he's been big for a while now.

4547
02:01:02,230 --> 02:01:02,650
Yeah.

4548
02:01:02,650 --> 02:01:03,100
He's like,

4549
02:01:03,100 --> 02:01:06,670
I feel like he's the one that made Emeral
got famous for a little bit and people

4550
02:01:06,690 --> 02:01:06,911
like,

4551
02:01:06,911 --> 02:01:08,500
will you shut the fuck up with that?

4552
02:01:08,501 --> 02:01:09,334
Bam.

4553
02:01:09,430 --> 02:01:10,300
Stop that.

4554
02:01:10,470 --> 02:01:11,200
Because he was like,

4555
02:01:11,200 --> 02:01:12,033
damn,

4556
02:01:12,820 --> 02:01:13,601
he knew that.

4557
02:01:13,601 --> 02:01:15,070
Like he needed a tagline.

4558
02:01:15,100 --> 02:01:15,230
Yeah,

4559
02:01:15,230 --> 02:01:15,911
exactly.

4560
02:01:15,911 --> 02:01:16,091
Yeah.

4561
02:01:16,091 --> 02:01:18,400
But he just shoved it
right down her throat.

4562
02:01:18,401 --> 02:01:19,234
That's right.

4563
02:01:19,390 --> 02:01:20,380
And then we got Bordain,

4564
02:01:20,440 --> 02:01:21,130
which is awesome.

4565
02:01:21,130 --> 02:01:21,340
Well,

4566
02:01:21,340 --> 02:01:22,210
boardings the first,

4567
02:01:22,240 --> 02:01:25,210
I think an example of what a
kitchen is really staffed with,

4568
02:01:25,240 --> 02:01:25,720
right.

4569
02:01:25,720 --> 02:01:26,270
You know,

4570
02:01:26,270 --> 02:01:30,250
wild punk rocker type dudes with
Mexicans working side by side.

4571
02:01:30,260 --> 02:01:30,890
Yeah.

4572
02:01:30,890 --> 02:01:31,270
You know,

4573
02:01:31,270 --> 02:01:32,680
and he's honest about the experience.

4574
02:01:33,090 --> 02:01:34,120
That's what it's awesome.

4575
02:01:34,480 --> 02:01:34,721
Yeah.

4576
02:01:34,721 --> 02:01:35,554
And he has a,

4577
02:01:35,660 --> 02:01:38,320
a genuine passion for cooking.

4578
02:01:38,321 --> 02:01:38,860
Yeah.

4579
02:01:38,860 --> 02:01:39,640
It a,

4580
02:01:39,640 --> 02:01:40,270
I never

4581
02:01:40,270 --> 02:01:44,890
worked in a kitchen other than like in
high school I did work for Papa Ginos or

4582
02:01:44,891 --> 02:01:48,550
in the kitchen [inaudible] worked at
Newport creamery like Megan burgers and

4583
02:01:48,551 --> 02:01:49,031
stuff like that,

4584
02:01:49,031 --> 02:01:50,800
but I've never worked in
like a real restaurant.

4585
02:01:51,220 --> 02:01:54,790
But he had an episode once where
they showed him actually working in a

4586
02:01:54,791 --> 02:01:55,331
restaurant,

4587
02:01:55,331 --> 02:01:58,930
like keeping up with all these orders as
they came in at time and all these food

4588
02:01:58,931 --> 02:01:59,290
and,

4589
02:01:59,290 --> 02:02:04,290
and how hard it is and how much of a
fucking stressful like high stress,

4590
02:02:04,960 --> 02:02:06,790
fast paced Gig it is.

4591
02:02:06,791 --> 02:02:08,140
It's like wow.

4592
02:02:08,560 --> 02:02:13,560
He really opens up your eyes to how
difficult and how much artistic like flare

4593
02:02:14,321 --> 02:02:17,260
is involved in the culinary arts,

4594
02:02:17,290 --> 02:02:17,770
you know?

4595
02:02:17,770 --> 02:02:18,600
Fantastic.

4596
02:02:18,600 --> 02:02:19,433
Yeah.

4597
02:02:20,630 --> 02:02:22,340
There's guys who is
getting more famous now.

4598
02:02:22,730 --> 02:02:27,160
Who was a in that front is the chef
Ludo you don't talking about no Louis,

4599
02:02:27,320 --> 02:02:28,240
he just make this guy out.

4600
02:02:28,310 --> 02:02:28,461
No,

4601
02:02:28,461 --> 02:02:30,560
I swear to God he's all ready for you.

4602
02:02:30,561 --> 02:02:31,070
You Fuck?

4603
02:02:31,070 --> 02:02:31,903
He's a,

4604
02:02:32,060 --> 02:02:32,570
he's a,

4605
02:02:32,570 --> 02:02:33,560
he's a French guy.

4606
02:02:33,890 --> 02:02:36,380
He was doing popup restaurants here in la.

4607
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:39,890
What's a pop up restaurant where they
go like they find a space of an already

4608
02:02:39,891 --> 02:02:44,891
existing restaurant and they go from
this from like a March 5th to May 1st my

4609
02:02:48,351 --> 02:02:49,340
restaurant is going to,

4610
02:02:49,400 --> 02:02:52,730
I'm an operate here during
these hours in these times,

4611
02:02:52,760 --> 02:02:55,130
like it typically a place
that does breakfast and lunch.

4612
02:02:55,131 --> 02:03:00,131
Let's say we're going to do dinner from
now on and except he is this amazing

4613
02:03:00,711 --> 02:03:01,544
chef.

4614
02:03:02,110 --> 02:03:02,990
So it would pop up,

4615
02:03:03,680 --> 02:03:05,330
it would fill out every night,

4616
02:03:05,331 --> 02:03:09,360
would be booked out and then he would
shut shop and then like go away for awhile

4617
02:03:09,410 --> 02:03:11,600
and do whatever he does and then be like,

4618
02:03:11,601 --> 02:03:13,610
Hey July I'm coming to,

4619
02:03:13,700 --> 02:03:14,481
you know Venice,

4620
02:03:14,481 --> 02:03:15,314
I'm going to take,

4621
02:03:15,470 --> 02:03:16,340
take place over.

4622
02:03:16,440 --> 02:03:17,810
I'm going to take over
that one restaurant.

4623
02:03:17,960 --> 02:03:19,190
How does he let people know?

4624
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:21,890
Well it's the word of mouth really spread.

4625
02:03:22,250 --> 02:03:25,970
Like my cousin is the one that let me
know about it and we went there and we

4626
02:03:25,971 --> 02:03:27,560
ordered one of everything on the menu.

4627
02:03:27,770 --> 02:03:28,880
Like that's how,

4628
02:03:29,090 --> 02:03:30,200
cause it's not like,

4629
02:03:30,430 --> 02:03:31,790
it wasn't like full portion size,

4630
02:03:31,791 --> 02:03:35,210
it was like tasting style
and it was just incredible.

4631
02:03:35,330 --> 02:03:39,380
And it's the kind of place you walk away
and then you start telling people like

4632
02:03:39,410 --> 02:03:39,890
it.

4633
02:03:39,890 --> 02:03:42,500
That's a really spreads like wildfire.

4634
02:03:42,501 --> 02:03:45,470
And then now he was on
a food show last year.

4635
02:03:45,471 --> 02:03:49,130
He's a judge on that show
that Bourdain is hosting.

4636
02:03:49,580 --> 02:03:50,380
Um,

4637
02:03:50,380 --> 02:03:50,840
yeah.

4638
02:03:50,840 --> 02:03:51,081
Yeah.

4639
02:03:51,081 --> 02:03:51,800
What is that?

4640
02:03:51,800 --> 02:03:53,330
I forget he's hosting a new show.

4641
02:03:53,440 --> 02:03:54,740
It's a judging thing.

4642
02:03:54,770 --> 02:03:56,060
I think it's a food tasting thing.

4643
02:03:56,420 --> 02:03:58,370
And Ludo was one of the
guest judges on that.

4644
02:03:58,400 --> 02:04:03,400
And that dude has a fried chicken
truck in la that is on real.

4645
02:04:04,700 --> 02:04:06,350
You got to go to his food truck.

4646
02:04:06,380 --> 02:04:06,951
How do you find it?

4647
02:04:06,951 --> 02:04:07,490
Easy truck.

4648
02:04:07,490 --> 02:04:08,420
It's on Twitter.

4649
02:04:08,450 --> 02:04:09,620
It's online where you look.

4650
02:04:09,920 --> 02:04:11,660
Will you look for Chef Ludo owes,

4651
02:04:12,050 --> 02:04:12,650
uh,

4652
02:04:12,650 --> 02:04:14,330
fried chicken truck and did,

4653
02:04:14,331 --> 02:04:17,780
you can find out where it is from Twitter
because you follow them and they're

4654
02:04:17,781 --> 02:04:18,290
like,

4655
02:04:18,290 --> 02:04:19,101
we're parked at,

4656
02:04:19,101 --> 02:04:19,790
you know,

4657
02:04:19,790 --> 02:04:20,301
whatever.

4658
02:04:20,301 --> 02:04:21,270
Hollywood boulevard.

4659
02:04:21,271 --> 02:04:21,780
And,

4660
02:04:21,780 --> 02:04:22,613
and I said,

4661
02:04:22,720 --> 02:04:23,270
good.

4662
02:04:23,270 --> 02:04:23,720
Yes,

4663
02:04:23,720 --> 02:04:24,553
definitely.

4664
02:04:24,620 --> 02:04:25,453
Always align.

4665
02:04:26,150 --> 02:04:26,870
Um,

4666
02:04:26,870 --> 02:04:27,351
when I went,

4667
02:04:27,351 --> 02:04:29,510
I tracked it down one time and it was,

4668
02:04:29,540 --> 02:04:29,781
no,

4669
02:04:29,781 --> 02:04:30,650
it wasn't too crazy.

4670
02:04:30,651 --> 02:04:31,484
It was actually,

4671
02:04:31,610 --> 02:04:33,680
they were actually wrapping
up for the lingo truck.

4672
02:04:33,700 --> 02:04:34,190
Yeah.

4673
02:04:34,190 --> 02:04:35,960
This ain't your Mama's fried chick dude.

4674
02:04:35,961 --> 02:04:36,591
It's crazy.

4675
02:04:36,591 --> 02:04:37,020
Good.

4676
02:04:37,020 --> 02:04:37,890
I'm not really you.

4677
02:04:37,891 --> 02:04:38,040
It's

4678
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:38,520
that good.

4679
02:04:38,520 --> 02:04:39,120
Yes.

4680
02:04:39,120 --> 02:04:40,260
What could be so good about it?

4681
02:04:40,530 --> 02:04:42,900
There's just something about the,

4682
02:04:43,500 --> 02:04:46,710
the richness of the flavor of the chicken.

4683
02:04:46,740 --> 02:04:47,340
The,

4684
02:04:47,340 --> 02:04:47,641
the,

4685
02:04:47,641 --> 02:04:48,060
um,

4686
02:04:48,060 --> 02:04:48,691
the breading.

4687
02:04:48,691 --> 02:04:52,200
Like the fried part itself
is just has a flavor to it.

4688
02:04:52,201 --> 02:04:53,034
It's phenomenal.

4689
02:04:53,130 --> 02:04:55,530
And so are like the other
things they have there.

4690
02:04:55,680 --> 02:04:56,760
I feel like Ludo truck,

4691
02:04:56,761 --> 02:04:57,750
you should send me some shit now.

4692
02:04:57,751 --> 02:04:58,380
I just really,

4693
02:04:58,380 --> 02:04:58,801
yeah,

4694
02:04:58,801 --> 02:04:59,634
you should.

4695
02:04:59,730 --> 02:05:00,421
What the fuck?

4696
02:05:00,421 --> 02:05:01,070
Ludo truck.

4697
02:05:01,070 --> 02:05:01,903
A little truck.

4698
02:05:02,010 --> 02:05:04,530
I don't know how they're gonna
fuck with 'em hooked me up.

4699
02:05:05,130 --> 02:05:05,550
I mean,

4700
02:05:05,550 --> 02:05:08,970
it seems like it's like a good
idea and everything like that.

4701
02:05:08,971 --> 02:05:10,470
But do they want is,

4702
02:05:10,590 --> 02:05:11,640
it's not his main thing.

4703
02:05:11,760 --> 02:05:12,420
Like,

4704
02:05:12,420 --> 02:05:12,511
oh,

4705
02:05:12,511 --> 02:05:12,901
I don't know.

4706
02:05:12,901 --> 02:05:15,780
I don't remember because how you gonna
fuck with Roscoe and Melrose tonight?

4707
02:05:16,080 --> 02:05:17,970
How are you gonna fuck with
Roscoe's if you don't have,

4708
02:05:18,330 --> 02:05:19,470
if you don't have waffles,

4709
02:05:19,500 --> 02:05:20,790
you're not gonna fuck with Roscoe.

4710
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:22,010
I just started following him.

4711
02:05:22,050 --> 02:05:22,410
Okay.

4712
02:05:22,410 --> 02:05:24,870
Roscoe's Shit Roscoe's or this shit,

4713
02:05:24,871 --> 02:05:25,704
dude.

4714
02:05:26,100 --> 02:05:27,020
[inaudible]

4715
02:05:27,270 --> 02:05:29,160
chicken and waffles are
so hard to fuck with.

4716
02:05:29,220 --> 02:05:30,030
It's so good.

4717
02:05:30,030 --> 02:05:30,571
So good.

4718
02:05:30,571 --> 02:05:32,340
And you get those Collard
Greens with it too.

4719
02:05:32,341 --> 02:05:34,320
So you can give yourself
an illusion of vitamins.

4720
02:05:35,240 --> 02:05:35,700
It's right.

4721
02:05:35,700 --> 02:05:39,870
I throw hot sauce all over
the chicken and extra butter.

4722
02:05:40,170 --> 02:05:43,020
Extra Sierra hungry because
you know you're going deep.

4723
02:05:43,021 --> 02:05:43,880
You're to know you're going to do,

4724
02:05:43,920 --> 02:05:45,720
you guys want to eat when
to get some food after this.

4725
02:05:45,880 --> 02:05:46,450
All right.

4726
02:05:46,450 --> 02:05:50,490
He know you're going deep waffles
with SMA and their American waffles.

4727
02:05:50,530 --> 02:05:50,860
Yeah,

4728
02:05:50,860 --> 02:05:54,490
those fucking big gay
Belgian motherfucker shows.

4729
02:05:54,510 --> 02:05:56,460
Big Fluffy cloud waffles.

4730
02:05:56,461 --> 02:05:57,330
That's not a waffle.

4731
02:05:57,331 --> 02:05:58,290
That's a pastry.

4732
02:05:58,500 --> 02:05:59,580
That's a loaf of bread.

4733
02:05:59,581 --> 02:06:01,540
You fuck a real waffle house?

4734
02:06:01,570 --> 02:06:04,140
Little skinny tight ones that
you get at a waffle house.

4735
02:06:04,410 --> 02:06:05,680
That's a real waffle.

4736
02:06:05,681 --> 02:06:07,020
You do a lot of syrup or do you do,

4737
02:06:07,320 --> 02:06:07,681
yeah.

4738
02:06:07,681 --> 02:06:11,070
I like to talk a lot of butter and a lot
of syrup because I'm not trying to be

4739
02:06:11,071 --> 02:06:11,760
healthy.

4740
02:06:11,760 --> 02:06:12,170
Okay.

4741
02:06:12,170 --> 02:06:12,291
Oh,

4742
02:06:12,291 --> 02:06:13,230
the waffles asshole.

4743
02:06:13,260 --> 02:06:13,500
Yeah,

4744
02:06:13,500 --> 02:06:14,011
exactly.

4745
02:06:14,011 --> 02:06:15,630
I'll punish myself later at the gym.

4746
02:06:15,870 --> 02:06:16,410
Trust me,

4747
02:06:16,410 --> 02:06:16,600
I,

4748
02:06:16,600 --> 02:06:17,640
I'm disciplined,

4749
02:06:17,910 --> 02:06:22,590
but right now I'm gonna beat the fuck out
of this waffle and I'm going to have a

4750
02:06:22,591 --> 02:06:25,650
regular coke fuck a diet
coke because why play games?

4751
02:06:25,651 --> 02:06:25,921
Sugar,

4752
02:06:25,921 --> 02:06:26,191
sugar,

4753
02:06:26,191 --> 02:06:26,640
sugar.

4754
02:06:26,640 --> 02:06:27,473
Again,

4755
02:06:27,570 --> 02:06:29,490
I'm going to pretend
that I have a diet coke.

4756
02:06:29,491 --> 02:06:29,641
No,

4757
02:06:29,641 --> 02:06:31,470
I'm going to have a regular
coke and a cup of coffee.

4758
02:06:31,650 --> 02:06:34,800
A Cup of coffee is to allow me to stay
conscious long enough to walk to the car,

4759
02:06:34,830 --> 02:06:36,510
get me super excited about this shit.

4760
02:06:36,511 --> 02:06:37,344
Right.

4761
02:06:37,680 --> 02:06:41,430
There should be a Roscoe's chicken and
waffles and every country it's one of

4762
02:06:41,431 --> 02:06:42,270
those 600 words.

4763
02:06:42,271 --> 02:06:44,550
You don't forget it because somebody
pitches it to you and you're like,

4764
02:06:44,551 --> 02:06:45,660
what if you have never had it?

4765
02:06:45,690 --> 02:06:46,081
What's that?

4766
02:06:46,081 --> 02:06:46,980
I'll let chickens.

4767
02:06:46,981 --> 02:06:47,461
Very,

4768
02:06:47,461 --> 02:06:47,941
very,

4769
02:06:47,941 --> 02:06:52,620
very good delicious fried chicken and
it's very homestyle fried chicken.

4770
02:06:52,620 --> 02:06:55,110
Like it tastes like somebody
made it in their house.

4771
02:06:55,111 --> 02:06:57,780
Whereas like sometimes you
go to Kentucky Fried Chicken,

4772
02:06:57,781 --> 02:07:02,781
it's so uniform and it has like a certain
amount of sodium tastes that it's like

4773
02:07:03,360 --> 02:07:05,200
this is a mix and you know you got,

4774
02:07:05,860 --> 02:07:06,750
you need Roscoe's.

4775
02:07:06,751 --> 02:07:08,940
It feels like somebody
actually crack some eggs.

4776
02:07:08,941 --> 02:07:10,890
Actually dip the chicken in.

4777
02:07:10,891 --> 02:07:15,891
It actually rolled in and flour and deep
fried the fuck out of that shit's so

4778
02:07:17,120 --> 02:07:18,030
Roscoe's on Pico.

4779
02:07:18,031 --> 02:07:18,650
I see you.

4780
02:07:18,650 --> 02:07:22,050
I'll see you Holla out
to Roscoe's on Gower.

4781
02:07:23,640 --> 02:07:24,473
Yeah,

4782
02:07:24,620 --> 02:07:26,190
that's a beautiful combination.

4783
02:07:26,220 --> 02:07:27,053
It's fantastic.

4784
02:07:27,090 --> 02:07:28,470
Didn't seem like it would work.

4785
02:07:28,500 --> 02:07:29,333
You know,

4786
02:07:29,640 --> 02:07:31,350
if you looked at it on
paper you'd be like,

4787
02:07:31,351 --> 02:07:32,250
how's this gonna work?

4788
02:07:32,340 --> 02:07:32,600
Yeah.

4789
02:07:32,600 --> 02:07:33,251
Chicken and why?

4790
02:07:33,251 --> 02:07:34,470
Why would I want to
have those two together?

4791
02:07:34,680 --> 02:07:35,740
One of the you fuck

4792
02:07:36,370 --> 02:07:36,641
no,

4793
02:07:36,641 --> 02:07:37,474
it's perfect.

4794
02:07:37,900 --> 02:07:38,733
Oh boy.

4795
02:07:38,950 --> 02:07:39,581
You excited.

4796
02:07:39,581 --> 02:07:41,760
Now I want to go get chicken
and waffles side of it.

4797
02:07:41,920 --> 02:07:42,281
So,

4798
02:07:42,281 --> 02:07:42,521
um,

4799
02:07:42,521 --> 02:07:43,350
before we wrap up,

4800
02:07:43,350 --> 02:07:45,460
I mean we were going to talk
to them a little buddy Brian.

4801
02:07:45,520 --> 02:07:45,910
Sure.

4802
02:07:45,910 --> 02:07:46,390
And uh,

4803
02:07:46,390 --> 02:07:46,601
say,

4804
02:07:46,601 --> 02:07:50,090
what'd you think about our guests
with the crazy UFO talk fell.

4805
02:07:51,270 --> 02:07:52,650
Oh,

4806
02:07:54,090 --> 02:07:56,460
well I'm being nice being nice.

4807
02:07:57,300 --> 02:07:58,890
I mean,

4808
02:07:58,891 --> 02:08:00,990
he said he could talk to aliens,

4809
02:08:01,740 --> 02:08:02,490
right?

4810
02:08:02,490 --> 02:08:02,880
He's a,

4811
02:08:02,880 --> 02:08:04,200
he did say that right.

4812
02:08:04,710 --> 02:08:06,510
At one point you sit
down when he was younger,

4813
02:08:06,511 --> 02:08:07,300
he could,

4814
02:08:07,300 --> 02:08:08,780
he found a way to communicate,

4815
02:08:09,170 --> 02:08:11,540
meditated at a Tantrum,

4816
02:08:11,750 --> 02:08:16,750
thought and meditation was able to have
something that he was describing that

4817
02:08:16,761 --> 02:08:19,850
sounded to me very much
like a drug experience.

4818
02:08:19,851 --> 02:08:22,370
Like a psychedelic drug or
a meditation experience.

4819
02:08:22,371 --> 02:08:24,260
Some sort of a breakthrough,

4820
02:08:24,770 --> 02:08:25,630
sort of a,

4821
02:08:26,090 --> 02:08:26,570
yeah,

4822
02:08:26,570 --> 02:08:29,630
I mean he seemed like a nice
guy and he seemed intelligent.

4823
02:08:30,440 --> 02:08:31,610
But my,

4824
02:08:32,780 --> 02:08:35,290
my bullshit meter just
was out of control and,

4825
02:08:35,310 --> 02:08:35,511
and,

4826
02:08:35,511 --> 02:08:36,470
and when that happens,

4827
02:08:36,780 --> 02:08:37,090
the,

4828
02:08:37,090 --> 02:08:40,750
the were so many things like
wanted to like talk to them about,

4829
02:08:40,760 --> 02:08:44,560
but I also didn't want to like be
confrontational or confrontation though.

4830
02:08:45,130 --> 02:08:45,790
I don't know man.

4831
02:08:45,790 --> 02:08:46,640
I don't buy any of it.

4832
02:08:46,800 --> 02:08:47,633
Well,

4833
02:08:47,760 --> 02:08:51,480
I respect the guy for coming
on and talking and I don't,

4834
02:08:51,481 --> 02:08:51,750
you know,

4835
02:08:51,750 --> 02:08:56,750
I don't know whether or not he's right
or telling the truth and I don't feel

4836
02:08:57,361 --> 02:08:58,500
it's ever true.

4837
02:08:58,530 --> 02:08:58,801
I mean,

4838
02:08:58,801 --> 02:08:59,670
I have in the past,

4839
02:08:59,671 --> 02:09:00,121
don't get me wrong,

4840
02:09:00,121 --> 02:09:00,841
I'm not a hypocrite.

4841
02:09:00,841 --> 02:09:04,560
I'm just a person who was involved or
tried to evolve my conversational skills.

4842
02:09:05,010 --> 02:09:08,910
And one of the things that I try
not to do is ever called bullshit.

4843
02:09:08,911 --> 02:09:12,330
If I'm not 100% sure I
can believe I can be like,

4844
02:09:12,360 --> 02:09:14,040
I am positive this guy's full of shit.

4845
02:09:14,160 --> 02:09:15,420
But if I don't have any proof,

4846
02:09:16,170 --> 02:09:17,100
how can I call bullshit?

4847
02:09:17,280 --> 02:09:20,400
I can call bullshit on some of the things
he says if they don't make any sense.

4848
02:09:20,670 --> 02:09:21,150
You know,

4849
02:09:21,150 --> 02:09:24,120
if some of the things he says
don't line up with facts,

4850
02:09:24,150 --> 02:09:25,290
you can call bullshit on that.

4851
02:09:25,291 --> 02:09:29,250
But I don't really know whether or not
he can actually do that until I go and

4852
02:09:29,251 --> 02:09:29,670
see it.

4853
02:09:29,670 --> 02:09:31,230
So I plan on going and seeing it.

4854
02:09:31,290 --> 02:09:33,120
I mean we're going to do
that for that show for,

4855
02:09:33,190 --> 02:09:33,960
for Bam,

4856
02:09:33,960 --> 02:09:34,531
for question.

4857
02:09:34,531 --> 02:09:35,160
Everything.

4858
02:09:35,160 --> 02:09:35,993
We're going to go,

4859
02:09:36,210 --> 02:09:37,410
we're going to go out
to the fucking desert.

4860
02:09:37,411 --> 02:09:37,591
Him,

4861
02:09:37,591 --> 02:09:38,730
Eddie Bravo is going to come to,

4862
02:09:39,390 --> 02:09:42,250
I just think it'd be perfect cause
Eddie loves him some Ufo shows

4863
02:09:42,430 --> 02:09:42,940
and then,

4864
02:09:42,940 --> 02:09:43,720
and then,

4865
02:09:43,720 --> 02:09:45,580
and then there was like
the thing where he,

4866
02:09:45,581 --> 02:09:46,414
he sits in his,

4867
02:09:46,670 --> 02:09:50,000
in the desert and he shines
lasers in the sky and you know,

4868
02:09:50,001 --> 02:09:50,760
he says that he,

4869
02:09:50,760 --> 02:09:55,730
it's 100% and then you go to his youtube
page to see what he's talking about is

4870
02:09:55,731 --> 02:09:58,110
100% and it's like one,

4871
02:09:58,180 --> 02:09:58,851
why is he shining?

4872
02:09:58,851 --> 02:10:00,770
Lasers at airplanes are up in the sky.

4873
02:10:00,771 --> 02:10:01,850
That's like against the law,

4874
02:10:02,030 --> 02:10:02,541
but to,

4875
02:10:02,541 --> 02:10:05,090
it's like his evidence is like,

4876
02:10:05,180 --> 02:10:05,480
oh,

4877
02:10:05,480 --> 02:10:08,780
you just see that flashing.in the
middle of the sky out of nowhere.

4878
02:10:08,840 --> 02:10:11,090
That's his alien communication.

4879
02:10:11,120 --> 02:10:12,920
And that could be a million things.

4880
02:10:12,921 --> 02:10:13,161
You know,

4881
02:10:13,161 --> 02:10:14,120
you see a little flashing guy.

4882
02:10:14,121 --> 02:10:15,980
It could be a shooting star,

4883
02:10:16,130 --> 02:10:16,851
it could be,

4884
02:10:16,851 --> 02:10:17,241
you know,

4885
02:10:17,241 --> 02:10:18,140
just anything.

4886
02:10:18,410 --> 02:10:20,060
It's way wackier than that gets

4887
02:10:20,060 --> 02:10:21,020
way wackier than that.

4888
02:10:21,080 --> 02:10:24,230
There's actually video that I watched
after the interview that I really wish I

4889
02:10:24,231 --> 02:10:25,190
had watched before.

4890
02:10:25,390 --> 02:10:25,520
I,

4891
02:10:25,520 --> 02:10:25,770
you know,

4892
02:10:25,770 --> 02:10:27,170
you can only watch so much of that stuff,

4893
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:27,830
right.

4894
02:10:27,830 --> 02:10:29,930
But where he said that he was,

4895
02:10:29,931 --> 02:10:30,110
uh,

4896
02:10:30,110 --> 02:10:35,110
he was leading a crew and that they
were of a craft at one point in time,

4897
02:10:36,021 --> 02:10:37,220
it was an interdimensional craft,

4898
02:10:37,221 --> 02:10:39,160
their standing in the middle of
field and they sense that he,

4899
02:10:39,610 --> 02:10:40,071
he was like,

4900
02:10:40,071 --> 02:10:44,060
and some people said they saw me
disappear for a moment and as I,

4901
02:10:44,830 --> 02:10:45,470
you know,

4902
02:10:45,470 --> 02:10:48,080
crossed into this area and that we,

4903
02:10:48,081 --> 02:10:48,231
you know,

4904
02:10:48,231 --> 02:10:49,520
we could see it in front of you.

4905
02:10:49,521 --> 02:10:51,110
Like it was sort of like a fog.

4906
02:10:51,590 --> 02:10:52,220
Well,

4907
02:10:52,220 --> 02:10:52,551
you know,

4908
02:10:52,551 --> 02:10:53,660
what we know is real

4909
02:10:55,080 --> 02:10:55,411
fog.

4910
02:10:55,411 --> 02:10:56,450
Fog is fucking real.

4911
02:10:56,700 --> 02:10:57,360
Okay.

4912
02:10:57,360 --> 02:10:58,620
So if you see fog,

4913
02:10:58,621 --> 02:11:02,070
you should assume that shit is
fog and I fucking spaceship.

4914
02:11:02,340 --> 02:11:03,173
Okay.

4915
02:11:03,270 --> 02:11:04,760
What was that thing at the handoffs?

4916
02:11:04,761 --> 02:11:06,480
So like I might have got this wrong,

4917
02:11:06,481 --> 02:11:11,481
but it sounded like he said you can buy
the movie and then once you buy it you

4918
02:11:12,721 --> 02:11:15,240
can put it for sale on your website.

4919
02:11:15,870 --> 02:11:16,800
And then you know,

4920
02:11:16,801 --> 02:11:20,040
like it almost sounded like he was
saying like it's a pyramid scheme.

4921
02:11:20,110 --> 02:11:22,180
Well it's not a pyramid scheme.

4922
02:11:22,210 --> 02:11:23,500
It's a promotional scheme,

4923
02:11:23,530 --> 02:11:24,520
a pyramid scheme.

4924
02:11:24,580 --> 02:11:27,130
There's really no nothing of value.

4925
02:11:27,370 --> 02:11:31,780
The way a pyramid scheme works is you get
money when you get other people to put

4926
02:11:31,781 --> 02:11:32,230
in money.

4927
02:11:32,230 --> 02:11:36,580
So like say if you're the guy who starts
a scheme and you have three people that

4928
02:11:36,581 --> 02:11:39,400
are in that are in the
scheme with you and you say,

4929
02:11:39,401 --> 02:11:39,821
listen,

4930
02:11:39,821 --> 02:11:44,080
if you get a dude to give 100
bucks for every hundred bucks,

4931
02:11:44,140 --> 02:11:46,030
you get 25 bucks and
they start making money.

4932
02:11:46,031 --> 02:11:47,060
That's what I'm saying.

4933
02:11:47,500 --> 02:11:48,370
That's not a pyramid scheme.

4934
02:11:48,371 --> 02:11:48,601
You know what?

4935
02:11:48,601 --> 02:11:49,434
You don't understand it.

4936
02:11:49,450 --> 02:11:52,960
A pyramid scheme is at the end
you find there's nothing of value.

4937
02:11:53,080 --> 02:11:57,370
And at the end what it is is that it
depends on more people donating money.

4938
02:11:57,610 --> 02:12:00,580
Then there's people extracting money and
as soon as the people want their money,

4939
02:12:00,610 --> 02:12:01,780
you're fucked because there's no money.

4940
02:12:01,780 --> 02:12:02,920
That's what happened with,

4941
02:12:02,921 --> 02:12:03,720
um,

4942
02:12:03,720 --> 02:12:04,051
that,

4943
02:12:04,051 --> 02:12:04,330
uh,

4944
02:12:04,330 --> 02:12:05,800
that it's called a Ponzi scheme.

4945
02:12:05,801 --> 02:12:07,750
That's what happened with Bernie Madoff.

4946
02:12:07,780 --> 02:12:08,470
Yeah,

4947
02:12:08,470 --> 02:12:09,191
that's what it was.

4948
02:12:09,191 --> 02:12:09,490
It was,

4949
02:12:09,490 --> 02:12:12,070
there was no actual value to anything.

4950
02:12:12,100 --> 02:12:14,950
What he's doing is he's offering you,

4951
02:12:15,160 --> 02:12:16,510
he has this video.

4952
02:12:16,750 --> 02:12:17,290
Okay,

4953
02:12:17,290 --> 02:12:21,880
and if you put a link on your site and
he's selling the video for five bucks,

4954
02:12:21,881 --> 02:12:25,570
he's selling a product and if he's
selling this video for five bucks,

4955
02:12:25,571 --> 02:12:29,770
if you put a link on your site and
the clicks go through your site,

4956
02:12:30,040 --> 02:12:31,060
it registers.

4957
02:12:31,090 --> 02:12:32,530
And so you get a piece,

4958
02:12:32,890 --> 02:12:34,060
whatever that piece is,

4959
02:12:34,061 --> 02:12:34,930
it's negotiated.

4960
02:12:34,931 --> 02:12:38,200
Whether it's 10 cents a video or a dollar
a video or whatever the fuck it is.

4961
02:12:38,201 --> 02:12:39,040
I don't know how much you get,

4962
02:12:39,250 --> 02:12:40,061
but whatever you get,

4963
02:12:40,061 --> 02:12:45,061
he's saying that he wanted to do that to
spread the wealth and encourage people

4964
02:12:45,401 --> 02:12:48,640
to promote the video because it would
be financially profitable for them as

4965
02:12:48,641 --> 02:12:49,240
well,

4966
02:12:49,240 --> 02:12:50,410
which is actually admirable.

4967
02:12:50,620 --> 02:12:51,220
I mean,

4968
02:12:51,220 --> 02:12:52,480
that's a cool way to do things.

4969
02:12:52,600 --> 02:12:57,280
If you decided to put a link on your site
and you made $1,000 in a month off of

4970
02:12:57,281 --> 02:12:57,671
his video,

4971
02:12:57,671 --> 02:12:58,720
that's your money man.

4972
02:12:58,840 --> 02:12:59,920
And you helped him.

4973
02:13:00,040 --> 02:13:00,701
You helped him,

4974
02:13:00,701 --> 02:13:01,481
you got the video out,

4975
02:13:01,481 --> 02:13:03,860
which is what he wanted and you got to,

4976
02:13:03,910 --> 02:13:04,743
you got some money.

4977
02:13:04,780 --> 02:13:06,190
So nothing wrong with that.

4978
02:13:06,220 --> 02:13:07,360
It's not a pyramid scheme.

4979
02:13:07,390 --> 02:13:11,110
A real pyramid scheme is a lie
because there's nothing of value.

4980
02:13:11,560 --> 02:13:12,210
But this isn't a,

4981
02:13:12,210 --> 02:13:13,060
this is a movie.

4982
02:13:13,090 --> 02:13:13,923
I know what you're saying.

4983
02:13:14,830 --> 02:13:16,180
This is an actual product.

4984
02:13:16,240 --> 02:13:17,073
What is the movie?

4985
02:13:17,110 --> 02:13:18,520
It's called serious.

4986
02:13:18,580 --> 02:13:18,860
It's,

4987
02:13:18,860 --> 02:13:19,390
uh,

4988
02:13:19,390 --> 02:13:19,840
his,

4989
02:13:19,840 --> 02:13:21,490
his whole thing is,

4990
02:13:22,840 --> 02:13:23,860
it's very sketch.

4991
02:13:23,980 --> 02:13:24,610
Okay.

4992
02:13:24,610 --> 02:13:25,151
And it's,

4993
02:13:25,151 --> 02:13:25,510
uh,

4994
02:13:25,510 --> 02:13:25,721
I,

4995
02:13:25,721 --> 02:13:26,140
I look,

4996
02:13:26,140 --> 02:13:27,730
I should say first of all,

4997
02:13:27,850 --> 02:13:31,860
that I don't disbelieve in aliens.

4998
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:35,160
I don't disbelieve in the idea
that we've been contacted before,

4999
02:13:35,730 --> 02:13:40,730
but I have never seen anything that was
compelling to me as far as like visual

5000
02:13:42,421 --> 02:13:43,110
evidence.

5001
02:13:43,110 --> 02:13:44,220
As far as,

5002
02:13:44,300 --> 02:13:45,490
um,

5003
02:13:45,930 --> 02:13:47,160
eye witness testimony.

5004
02:13:47,370 --> 02:13:52,370
I've never seen anything compelling that
made me 100% sure that that person had

5005
02:13:53,851 --> 02:13:58,470
seen something from another planet or
that this video was something from another

5006
02:13:58,471 --> 02:13:58,890
planet.

5007
02:13:58,890 --> 02:14:00,150
I've seen some wild shit,

5008
02:14:00,151 --> 02:14:02,520
but I don't know exactly
what it is and I'm not,

5009
02:14:03,060 --> 02:14:07,590
I'm not privy to all of the various
pieces of information that go into,

5010
02:14:08,220 --> 02:14:09,000
you know,

5011
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:10,140
whatever the fuck happened.

5012
02:14:10,141 --> 02:14:12,660
When we see a thing that's
flying across the sky,

5013
02:14:12,990 --> 02:14:14,190
who knows what that is.

5014
02:14:14,490 --> 02:14:15,450
One of the things I asked him,

5015
02:14:15,451 --> 02:14:15,691
he said,

5016
02:14:15,691 --> 02:14:16,650
we have a photo of a,

5017
02:14:16,651 --> 02:14:18,240
of a being.

5018
02:14:18,570 --> 02:14:19,770
It's like it looks like a,

5019
02:14:19,980 --> 02:14:21,330
an ethereal being.

5020
02:14:21,510 --> 02:14:21,930
I go,

5021
02:14:21,930 --> 02:14:22,980
how do you know that's not a video?

5022
02:14:22,981 --> 02:14:23,371
Or if I go,

5023
02:14:23,371 --> 02:14:24,240
it's not an artifact.

5024
02:14:24,300 --> 02:14:24,781
Well how can you,

5025
02:14:24,781 --> 02:14:25,110
how you,

5026
02:14:25,110 --> 02:14:26,700
how the fuck could you possibly know?

5027
02:14:26,880 --> 02:14:28,560
Like there's a lot of artifacts.

5028
02:14:28,610 --> 02:14:28,761
Yeah.

5029
02:14:28,761 --> 02:14:30,620
That hologram thing is talking about.

5030
02:14:30,630 --> 02:14:30,891
I'm like,

5031
02:14:30,891 --> 02:14:31,701
are you kidding me?

5032
02:14:31,701 --> 02:14:33,950
You're actually saying
that's like a Hologram dude.

5033
02:14:33,951 --> 02:14:35,680
Or even at the photo

5034
02:14:35,800 --> 02:14:37,760
dimensional being looked at,

5035
02:14:37,790 --> 02:14:40,450
there's a lot of confirmation bias.

5036
02:14:40,480 --> 02:14:40,840
Yeah.

5037
02:14:40,840 --> 02:14:43,750
And the reality of the Ufo community,

5038
02:14:43,751 --> 02:14:44,590
and this is again,

5039
02:14:44,591 --> 02:14:45,940
this is not saying everyone,

5040
02:14:45,941 --> 02:14:47,680
and this is not saying
that you are foes are fake,

5041
02:14:47,950 --> 02:14:51,610
but the reality of the Ufo community
is that it's filled with Kooks.

5042
02:14:51,940 --> 02:14:53,710
Just like the psychic community.

5043
02:14:53,860 --> 02:14:55,540
Just like the big foot community,

5044
02:14:55,660 --> 02:14:57,490
just like the ghost community.

5045
02:14:57,580 --> 02:14:59,140
It doesn't mean that goats aren't real.

5046
02:14:59,160 --> 02:15:00,550
It doesn't mean big foot's not real.

5047
02:15:00,640 --> 02:15:04,180
But it means all a lot of those
people are drawn to Kooky Shit.

5048
02:15:04,350 --> 02:15:09,350
And another thing isn't like DNA nowadays
fast enough where you take a little

5049
02:15:09,601 --> 02:15:11,010
piece of that little alien dude,

5050
02:15:11,370 --> 02:15:12,060
you could just be like,

5051
02:15:12,060 --> 02:15:12,391
oh yeah,

5052
02:15:12,391 --> 02:15:13,224
it's a baby.

5053
02:15:13,430 --> 02:15:14,390
Well not only that,

5054
02:15:14,420 --> 02:15:16,250
did you know that that alien dude,

5055
02:15:16,550 --> 02:15:20,510
they found that fucking
thing and like 2002 yeah,

5056
02:15:20,720 --> 02:15:23,160
they found that thing a long ass time ago

5057
02:15:23,260 --> 02:15:25,840
or at Michael's craft shop or
would they find this thing?

5058
02:15:25,900 --> 02:15:27,430
They found it in the dirt somewhere.

5059
02:15:27,450 --> 02:15:27,570
Yeah.

5060
02:15:27,570 --> 02:15:28,900
He didn't want to tell
us where he found it.

5061
02:15:28,930 --> 02:15:30,460
He found it in a desert safe.

5062
02:15:30,520 --> 02:15:32,050
What do you said afterwards?

5063
02:15:32,051 --> 02:15:33,160
We're never supposed to repeat.

5064
02:15:33,580 --> 02:15:34,413
So be careful.

5065
02:15:34,480 --> 02:15:34,960
Oh yeah.

5066
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:37,270
Cause he told us where it's
being studied and shit.

5067
02:15:37,930 --> 02:15:40,900
But the bottom line is he set himself up.

5068
02:15:40,930 --> 02:15:41,231
Okay,

5069
02:15:41,231 --> 02:15:41,741
so here's,

5070
02:15:41,741 --> 02:15:45,880
here's either they do the genetic
work and it really is being done.

5071
02:15:45,910 --> 02:15:48,550
That's High Level Ivy League school.

5072
02:15:48,760 --> 02:15:53,560
And we find out about it and we get like
peer reviewed papers that are talking

5073
02:15:53,561 --> 02:15:55,060
about whatever the fuck this thing is.

5074
02:15:55,330 --> 02:15:56,690
Whether it's a dis,

5075
02:15:57,160 --> 02:15:58,840
like some sort of a fetus,

5076
02:15:58,841 --> 02:16:01,650
it's got birth defects and
makes it look like that.

5077
02:16:01,690 --> 02:16:06,670
I mean who knows what the hell it is
or completely artificial or you know,

5078
02:16:06,730 --> 02:16:07,240
whatever.

5079
02:16:07,240 --> 02:16:09,640
Well you know w if they
actually run a test,

5080
02:16:09,700 --> 02:16:14,590
but to say that you did a test
and to say you got results coming,

5081
02:16:14,950 --> 02:16:17,110
you'll set yourself up
because it's one or the other.

5082
02:16:17,111 --> 02:16:20,320
Now it's either bullshit
or it's something.

5083
02:16:20,350 --> 02:16:20,800
Yeah.

5084
02:16:20,800 --> 02:16:22,060
And if it's a rubber doll,

5085
02:16:22,090 --> 02:16:23,290
I'm going to be upset at you.

5086
02:16:23,970 --> 02:16:24,561
Of course.

5087
02:16:24,561 --> 02:16:25,394
Yeah.

5088
02:16:25,790 --> 02:16:27,170
I think that's a test that it,

5089
02:16:27,171 --> 02:16:28,160
it's like a week,

5090
02:16:28,220 --> 02:16:28,551
a week.

5091
02:16:28,551 --> 02:16:29,384
DNA.

5092
02:16:29,610 --> 02:16:30,480
I think it takes that long.

5093
02:16:30,481 --> 02:16:32,580
Like if there's a fire in a car,

5094
02:16:32,790 --> 02:16:33,750
the police can go,

5095
02:16:33,810 --> 02:16:34,201
okay,

5096
02:16:34,201 --> 02:16:37,530
we found human remains cause we
checked its DNA as human DNA.

5097
02:16:37,590 --> 02:16:38,730
Isn't that something fast?

5098
02:16:40,320 --> 02:16:41,010
I don't know.

5099
02:16:41,010 --> 02:16:43,230
How does he not know
how to use a camera yet?

5100
02:16:43,680 --> 02:16:43,950
I'm sorry.

5101
02:16:43,950 --> 02:16:44,071
Well,

5102
02:16:44,071 --> 02:16:44,341
let's,

5103
02:16:44,341 --> 02:16:44,640
let's,

5104
02:16:44,640 --> 02:16:44,971
let's,

5105
02:16:44,971 --> 02:16:48,150
let's Google the whole,

5106
02:16:48,200 --> 02:16:51,060
just a guest you had
on the big foot thing.

5107
02:16:51,390 --> 02:16:54,040
He's the biggest big a phone.

5108
02:16:56,010 --> 02:17:00,660
Well he only saw two
bone saw to Dr. Greer.

5109
02:17:00,661 --> 02:17:00,991
Hold on.

5110
02:17:00,991 --> 02:17:01,950
Dr. Greer,

5111
02:17:02,390 --> 02:17:05,490
ideally in a top sea.

5112
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:06,151
Oh,

5113
02:17:06,151 --> 02:17:07,490
all of those are fucking bullshit.

5114
02:17:08,320 --> 02:17:09,280
The autopsy films.

5115
02:17:10,870 --> 02:17:11,703
Um,

5116
02:17:12,540 --> 02:17:13,470
Dr. Greer,

5117
02:17:13,530 --> 02:17:14,580
alien body.

5118
02:17:15,690 --> 02:17:17,730
I just don't like it if he is,

5119
02:17:18,180 --> 02:17:19,150
if he's a bullshitter,

5120
02:17:19,590 --> 02:17:20,490
bullshitting is,

5121
02:17:20,491 --> 02:17:22,380
I am going to send shit to his house.

5122
02:17:22,410 --> 02:17:22,620
Okay.

5123
02:17:22,620 --> 02:17:23,453
I'll just say this.

5124
02:17:23,800 --> 02:17:28,560
At least a small percentage of what
he was saying smelled like bullshit.

5125
02:17:28,860 --> 02:17:30,540
The anecdotal stories,

5126
02:17:30,600 --> 02:17:31,350
the way they were,

5127
02:17:31,350 --> 02:17:32,250
they were coming out.

5128
02:17:32,340 --> 02:17:33,450
Somebody described them like,

5129
02:17:33,451 --> 02:17:34,920
like bad scenes in a movie.

5130
02:17:35,130 --> 02:17:38,760
Then he said this and I said that
sometimes people just sort of paraphrase

5131
02:17:38,761 --> 02:17:41,250
though and that could be responding to me.

5132
02:17:41,251 --> 02:17:44,160
You're telling a story over and over
and over again after a course of so many

5133
02:17:44,161 --> 02:17:44,850
years.

5134
02:17:44,850 --> 02:17:48,150
Sometimes people sort of paraphrase what
actually was said and they put it into

5135
02:17:48,151 --> 02:17:49,500
almost like a script form.

5136
02:17:49,740 --> 02:17:51,930
And that could have been
what that guy was doing.

5137
02:17:51,931 --> 02:17:53,270
Cause it did sound like fiction.

5138
02:17:53,340 --> 02:17:53,611
Yeah.

5139
02:17:53,611 --> 02:17:54,780
It also sounded like,

5140
02:17:54,810 --> 02:17:58,470
I noticed that whenever you would ask him
a question and that kind of throw them

5141
02:17:58,471 --> 02:17:59,340
off or whatever,

5142
02:17:59,610 --> 02:18:02,590
he would go into this weird voice
where he just suddenly good.

5143
02:18:03,200 --> 02:18:03,560
Yeah.

5144
02:18:03,560 --> 02:18:07,280
So like it got really quiet and calm like,

5145
02:18:08,220 --> 02:18:08,750
yeah.

5146
02:18:08,750 --> 02:18:09,510
Hmm.

5147
02:18:09,510 --> 02:18:11,160
Like his voice changed into this.

5148
02:18:11,161 --> 02:18:13,140
We're really weird volume.

5149
02:18:13,190 --> 02:18:13,670
It just went.

5150
02:18:13,670 --> 02:18:14,451
Those were three of us.

5151
02:18:14,451 --> 02:18:17,450
They think they have an
alien body or that thing.

5152
02:18:18,230 --> 02:18:19,063
What do you think that is?

5153
02:18:19,580 --> 02:18:21,480
I think that's a very old human body.

5154
02:18:21,481 --> 02:18:22,430
Six inches long.

5155
02:18:23,300 --> 02:18:26,480
But they have a math and a
ruler next to it and everything,

5156
02:18:26,510 --> 02:18:29,340
but couldn't that be from it's fuck.

5157
02:18:29,390 --> 02:18:33,780
Of course it could be a child or it
could be so old that it's like when the,

5158
02:18:33,800 --> 02:18:34,633
but he doesn't know.

5159
02:18:34,940 --> 02:18:35,690
He said,

5160
02:18:35,690 --> 02:18:38,720
I mean in his defense he said he doesn't
know what it is and he said they're

5161
02:18:38,721 --> 02:18:39,680
doing tests on it.

5162
02:18:39,850 --> 02:18:40,140
Yeah,

5163
02:18:40,140 --> 02:18:41,810
but if he found it that long ago,

5164
02:18:42,320 --> 02:18:44,240
I don't know when he
got ahold of it though.

5165
02:18:44,570 --> 02:18:45,291
He told us,

5166
02:18:45,291 --> 02:18:46,160
I don't remember.

5167
02:18:46,220 --> 02:18:47,900
It was a long conversation and we talked,

5168
02:18:47,930 --> 02:18:49,460
we talked to the guy for three hours.

5169
02:18:49,650 --> 02:18:50,210
It's going to be,

5170
02:18:50,210 --> 02:18:50,870
hey guys.

5171
02:18:50,870 --> 02:18:51,021
Yeah,

5172
02:18:51,021 --> 02:18:51,400
we ran,

5173
02:18:51,400 --> 02:18:56,400
says it was a guy years ago in January
of 2013 and it says that the studies will

5174
02:18:59,451 --> 02:19:00,740
take around two months,

5175
02:19:00,800 --> 02:19:01,730
possibly longer.

5176
02:19:01,790 --> 02:19:04,790
So they just started
the testing in January.

5177
02:19:04,820 --> 02:19:06,130
So that's why they haven't gotten these,

5178
02:19:06,140 --> 02:19:06,951
doing these testing.

5179
02:19:06,951 --> 02:19:07,784
Mcafee,

5180
02:19:08,270 --> 02:19:08,991
McAfee,

5181
02:19:08,991 --> 02:19:10,120
what happened at McAfee?

5182
02:19:10,121 --> 02:19:10,490
Mcafee,

5183
02:19:10,490 --> 02:19:11,270
he's balling.

5184
02:19:11,270 --> 02:19:14,730
He's in a Texas trying to sell
his house and believes dude,

5185
02:19:15,170 --> 02:19:15,591
dude,

5186
02:19:15,591 --> 02:19:16,110
dude,

5187
02:19:16,110 --> 02:19:16,943
dude.

5188
02:19:18,020 --> 02:19:18,231
Yeah,

5189
02:19:18,231 --> 02:19:21,880
he's got his 20 year old Third World
Hottie with them just getting this freak.

5190
02:19:21,881 --> 02:19:22,670
Huh.

5191
02:19:22,670 --> 02:19:23,503
Good for him.

5192
02:19:24,130 --> 02:19:24,770
Um,

5193
02:19:24,770 --> 02:19:25,603
yeah.

5194
02:19:26,330 --> 02:19:27,163
I don't know man.

5195
02:19:27,170 --> 02:19:28,003
You know,

5196
02:19:28,240 --> 02:19:29,890
if he really did find an alien,

5197
02:19:29,910 --> 02:19:30,890
like Holy Shit.

5198
02:19:31,220 --> 02:19:32,870
I mean maybe can you imagine?

5199
02:19:32,890 --> 02:19:35,600
That would be really fascinating and
ironic if there was a guy who was a

5200
02:19:35,630 --> 02:19:36,960
charlatan who was a,

5201
02:19:36,961 --> 02:19:39,470
a total UFO hoaxer but
somebody gave him a real alien.

5202
02:19:41,150 --> 02:19:41,481
You know?

5203
02:19:41,481 --> 02:19:43,130
And I'm not saying that
Greer is a charlatan.

5204
02:19:43,131 --> 02:19:43,964
I don't think he is.

5205
02:19:44,240 --> 02:19:44,751
I think,

5206
02:19:44,751 --> 02:19:45,690
um,

5207
02:19:46,340 --> 02:19:49,610
first of all he's dealing with
a really nutty group of humans,

5208
02:19:49,840 --> 02:19:50,990
the Ufo community.

5209
02:19:51,020 --> 02:19:51,970
And I think if that's your,

5210
02:19:52,130 --> 02:19:56,240
your base and that you're communicating
with them only for decade after decade.

5211
02:19:56,270 --> 02:20:01,270
And most of this was sort of instigated
on your part before the Internet.

5212
02:20:02,601 --> 02:20:05,630
So he was involved in like
the Ufo community before,

5213
02:20:05,650 --> 02:20:06,140
you know,

5214
02:20:06,140 --> 02:20:08,330
people were even online
a lot before Twitter,

5215
02:20:08,540 --> 02:20:09,830
before you in my space.

5216
02:20:10,160 --> 02:20:11,420
Like he was online,

5217
02:20:11,450 --> 02:20:11,781
you know,

5218
02:20:11,781 --> 02:20:11,990
like,

5219
02:20:11,990 --> 02:20:16,990
and he was known through the world from
these youtube clips and shit like that.

5220
02:20:17,630 --> 02:20:18,291
He was already,

5221
02:20:18,291 --> 02:20:18,801
before that,

5222
02:20:18,801 --> 02:20:21,170
it had been long before
the disclosure project,

5223
02:20:21,171 --> 02:20:22,880
he had put that together for years.

5224
02:20:23,270 --> 02:20:24,570
So he had always been involved.

5225
02:20:24,590 --> 02:20:25,490
All these nutty people.

5226
02:20:25,520 --> 02:20:26,090
Yeah.

5227
02:20:26,090 --> 02:20:27,710
And when you're involved
with nutty people,

5228
02:20:27,711 --> 02:20:30,350
especially the nutty Ufo
people before the Internet,

5229
02:20:30,351 --> 02:20:32,090
like you got a lot of adjusting to do.

5230
02:20:32,360 --> 02:20:32,861
Once the,

5231
02:20:32,861 --> 02:20:33,051
the,

5232
02:20:33,051 --> 02:20:33,331
the,

5233
02:20:33,331 --> 02:20:38,060
the Thor Hammer of reality comes down
and sometimes guys adjust really poorly.

5234
02:20:38,300 --> 02:20:40,220
So they still have a lot
of bullshit in their game.

5235
02:20:40,460 --> 02:20:40,761
You know,

5236
02:20:40,761 --> 02:20:45,761
they might have a few things that are
real that they're investigating that are

5237
02:20:46,071 --> 02:20:48,320
beyond understanding there.

5238
02:20:48,350 --> 02:20:49,460
It's very possible.

5239
02:20:49,610 --> 02:20:52,430
But there also might be some
fuckery mixed in there too.

5240
02:20:52,431 --> 02:20:53,840
And Leo Fuckery,

5241
02:20:54,200 --> 02:20:55,070
serious writers.

5242
02:20:55,220 --> 02:20:56,420
And you've gotta be real careful.

5243
02:20:56,421 --> 02:20:58,790
And one of the things is he's,

5244
02:20:58,791 --> 02:20:59,330
uh,

5245
02:20:59,330 --> 02:21:01,610
somehow or another he's drawing
an income from all of this.

5246
02:21:02,230 --> 02:21:03,920
He wasn't really that open about it,

5247
02:21:03,921 --> 02:21:07,910
but I know that he takes people out
into the desert and gives them an alien

5248
02:21:07,911 --> 02:21:10,370
encounters and shit and
they charges money for that.

5249
02:21:10,400 --> 02:21:10,971
Of course.

5250
02:21:10,971 --> 02:21:11,150
Yeah.

5251
02:21:11,150 --> 02:21:14,390
And it's like several days and you'd
take a bunch of people out there and you

5252
02:21:14,391 --> 02:21:14,930
know,

5253
02:21:14,930 --> 02:21:15,950
make some cash,

5254
02:21:18,230 --> 02:21:21,830
some shit in the sky almost makes me want
to say that you shouldn't even bother

5255
02:21:21,831 --> 02:21:22,760
dealing with this one.

5256
02:21:23,330 --> 02:21:24,250
It's so obvious.

5257
02:21:24,350 --> 02:21:24,531
No,

5258
02:21:24,531 --> 02:21:24,681
no,

5259
02:21:24,681 --> 02:21:24,861
no,

5260
02:21:24,861 --> 02:21:25,010
no,

5261
02:21:25,010 --> 02:21:25,220
no.

5262
02:21:25,220 --> 02:21:26,053
It's both.

5263
02:21:26,210 --> 02:21:27,140
It's fascinating.

5264
02:21:27,170 --> 02:21:27,711
He's a,

5265
02:21:27,711 --> 02:21:31,910
he's a certainly marketing himself and
he certainly brought up his site a lot,

5266
02:21:32,180 --> 02:21:33,050
but it's also,

5267
02:21:33,920 --> 02:21:34,880
here's the question,

5268
02:21:35,450 --> 02:21:40,450
what would you do if you knew that there
really was some sort of encounter with

5269
02:21:43,791 --> 02:21:45,110
humans and aliens?

5270
02:21:45,110 --> 02:21:49,010
If you knew that there had been a series
of events that had been swept under the

5271
02:21:49,011 --> 02:21:54,011
rug and covered up and you start making
a living doing something different,

5272
02:21:55,190 --> 02:21:59,240
but this fascination with Ufo gets in
the way and then all of a sudden you have

5273
02:21:59,241 --> 02:22:02,720
to quit your job and then as you're
quitting your job for something that you

5274
02:22:02,721 --> 02:22:03,590
absolutely believe in,

5275
02:22:03,591 --> 02:22:06,170
but it's totally ridiculed
by everyone around you,

5276
02:22:06,500 --> 02:22:11,320
then what if you have to figure out how
to make a living off of this thing that

5277
02:22:11,321 --> 02:22:11,670
you built?

5278
02:22:11,670 --> 02:22:15,390
So maybe it's that maybe
the guy's legit and may,

5279
02:22:15,391 --> 02:22:16,230
but it's this,

5280
02:22:16,460 --> 02:22:19,040
this trying to profit off of it,

5281
02:22:19,041 --> 02:22:22,270
which gets people to go
ahead and what's your motive?

5282
02:22:22,340 --> 02:22:22,671
Hey,

5283
02:22:22,671 --> 02:22:24,140
how can I got to pay
you to go to the desert?

5284
02:22:24,290 --> 02:22:25,123
Hey,

5285
02:22:25,140 --> 02:22:27,120
you do with all the money that
he got from his donated movie.

5286
02:22:27,120 --> 02:22:27,810
Hey,

5287
02:22:27,810 --> 02:22:29,130
how much did you claim on your taxes?

5288
02:22:29,131 --> 02:22:29,880
Where'd you get that money?

5289
02:22:29,880 --> 02:22:30,151
Where's it?

5290
02:22:30,151 --> 02:22:30,871
Where's it coming from?

5291
02:22:30,871 --> 02:22:31,501
You writing books,

5292
02:22:31,501 --> 02:22:32,161
you're selling the books,

5293
02:22:32,161 --> 02:22:32,821
you're doing lectures,

5294
02:22:32,821 --> 02:22:33,654
you're doing this,

5295
02:22:33,720 --> 02:22:34,890
you're taking people out in the desert.

5296
02:22:34,891 --> 02:22:35,550
You're profiting,

5297
02:22:35,550 --> 02:22:36,090
okay?

5298
02:22:36,090 --> 02:22:36,361
It's,

5299
02:22:36,361 --> 02:22:37,770
this is obviously how
you make your living.

5300
02:22:37,771 --> 02:22:38,010
Now,

5301
02:22:38,010 --> 02:22:39,510
not that there's anything wrong with that,

5302
02:22:39,660 --> 02:22:40,980
if he's legit,

5303
02:22:41,250 --> 02:22:42,360
if he's sincere,

5304
02:22:42,480 --> 02:22:44,490
but when you have those elements,

5305
02:22:44,520 --> 02:22:48,900
people automatically get skeptical
and then there's the part of like

5306
02:22:49,230 --> 02:22:54,230
extraordinary claims require extraordinary
evidence and when you're claiming

5307
02:22:55,260 --> 02:22:56,310
crazy shit,

5308
02:22:56,430 --> 02:23:00,540
you should have photos and video
ready to go at the drop of a hat.

5309
02:23:00,900 --> 02:23:03,450
And when I was questioning him
about where can I see these photos?

5310
02:23:03,451 --> 02:23:05,640
Like if you have photos you shouldn't.

5311
02:23:05,641 --> 02:23:06,001
First of all,

5312
02:23:06,001 --> 02:23:09,780
if you have something that's really
important for people to see and you are a

5313
02:23:09,781 --> 02:23:13,830
researcher and your whole Gig is
about trying to get the truth out,

5314
02:23:13,940 --> 02:23:16,530
you would put that shit online
the moment you got it right,

5315
02:23:16,600 --> 02:23:18,120
he would make sure it goes viral.

5316
02:23:18,240 --> 02:23:21,450
If you're holding it back and only
putting it in your documentary,

5317
02:23:23,070 --> 02:23:23,641
I got to go,

5318
02:23:23,641 --> 02:23:24,140
all right.

5319
02:23:24,140 --> 02:23:24,870
Yeah.

5320
02:23:24,870 --> 02:23:25,660
Okay.

5321
02:23:25,660 --> 02:23:25,931
I mean,

5322
02:23:25,931 --> 02:23:27,000
I see you trying to make some money,

5323
02:23:27,001 --> 02:23:30,920
but what you're doing is contrary to the,

5324
02:23:30,950 --> 02:23:31,111
the,

5325
02:23:31,111 --> 02:23:33,060
the path that you need
to follow to be taken

5326
02:23:33,070 --> 02:23:33,700
and serious,

5327
02:23:33,700 --> 02:23:38,110
especially a scientific path because
somebody that wants to tell you the truth

5328
02:23:38,140 --> 02:23:38,890
about,

5329
02:23:38,890 --> 02:23:39,310
uh,

5330
02:23:39,310 --> 02:23:39,641
you know,

5331
02:23:39,641 --> 02:23:43,240
a huge something that would have that
type of impact on the world and the way it

5332
02:23:43,241 --> 02:23:44,074
operates.

5333
02:23:44,190 --> 02:23:45,260
You don't go as,

5334
02:23:45,310 --> 02:23:48,340
as somebody that's pursued
this for my whole life,

5335
02:23:48,341 --> 02:23:49,174
I have the answer.

5336
02:23:50,080 --> 02:23:52,340
I want you to give me five bucks
first before I tell you about it.

5337
02:23:53,030 --> 02:23:53,530
B,

5338
02:23:53,530 --> 02:23:53,961
I mean,

5339
02:23:53,961 --> 02:23:54,351
again,

5340
02:23:54,351 --> 02:23:55,220
I have to be fair.

5341
02:23:55,250 --> 02:23:58,340
It also could be that he doesn't
understand how he's coming off.

5342
02:23:58,640 --> 02:24:00,070
It also could be true that,

5343
02:24:00,071 --> 02:24:00,321
you know,

5344
02:24:00,321 --> 02:24:02,660
he really truly has had these experiences,

5345
02:24:02,661 --> 02:24:05,750
but now he's in a scramble to try to
figure out how to make some money off of

5346
02:24:05,751 --> 02:24:06,320
it.

5347
02:24:06,320 --> 02:24:11,120
There's a fascinating website that details
Hillary Clinton's meetings with the

5348
02:24:11,121 --> 02:24:12,170
Rockefeller family.

5349
02:24:13,130 --> 02:24:13,963
It's really crazy.

5350
02:24:14,120 --> 02:24:15,350
And one of the photos,

5351
02:24:15,470 --> 02:24:16,221
Hillary Clinton,

5352
02:24:16,221 --> 02:24:21,221
it's walking and she's got this book
with her and people tried to figure out

5353
02:24:21,471 --> 02:24:23,060
what book it was like they're there.

5354
02:24:23,080 --> 02:24:28,080
They did a close up of the image and it's
a book on extraterrestrial encounters

5355
02:24:28,970 --> 02:24:29,381
and art.

5356
02:24:29,381 --> 02:24:29,841
It's about,

5357
02:24:29,841 --> 02:24:31,490
are we alone in the universe?

5358
02:24:31,850 --> 02:24:36,350
And the book is all about like what we
would do if we got contacted by an alien

5359
02:24:36,351 --> 02:24:39,650
race and she's walking with Rockefeller
who had given her that book.

5360
02:24:39,800 --> 02:24:40,280
Really?

5361
02:24:40,280 --> 02:24:40,670
Yeah.

5362
02:24:40,670 --> 02:24:43,970
So she's walking along
in his ranch in Wyoming.

5363
02:24:43,971 --> 02:24:46,580
He's worth about a fucking billion,

5364
02:24:46,580 --> 02:24:46,581
trillion dollars.

5365
02:24:46,581 --> 02:24:48,410
He's at the top of the
financial food chain.

5366
02:24:48,620 --> 02:24:51,650
And he's exactly the person that this guy,

5367
02:24:51,651 --> 02:24:55,430
Dr. Steven Greer was telling us we'd have
access to this kind of information and

5368
02:24:55,431 --> 02:24:56,870
would want to,

5369
02:24:56,871 --> 02:24:57,230
uh,

5370
02:24:57,230 --> 02:24:57,531
you know,

5371
02:24:57,531 --> 02:24:59,120
figure out what we do.

5372
02:24:59,360 --> 02:24:59,601
You know,

5373
02:24:59,601 --> 02:25:01,310
what do we do about the banking system,

5374
02:25:01,320 --> 02:25:02,480
what we do about the military.

5375
02:25:02,481 --> 02:25:03,350
So what do we do when,

5376
02:25:03,380 --> 02:25:03,710
if,

5377
02:25:03,710 --> 02:25:05,990
when and if aliens do come.

5378
02:25:06,290 --> 02:25:09,280
And so he's walking around and
meeting a woman who ran for president.

5379
02:25:09,281 --> 02:25:12,440
It was the wife of the president of the
secretary of state and then wandering

5380
02:25:12,441 --> 02:25:15,020
around is fucking a ranch and she's
got an alien book in her hand,

5381
02:25:15,080 --> 02:25:15,913
but he gave her,

5382
02:25:16,540 --> 02:25:17,630
now that was that photo.

5383
02:25:17,640 --> 02:25:18,850
The original photo was,

5384
02:25:18,860 --> 02:25:19,221
good question.

5385
02:25:19,221 --> 02:25:19,531
Is it,

5386
02:25:19,531 --> 02:25:21,200
is it published anywhere?

5387
02:25:21,230 --> 02:25:22,100
Respectable,

5388
02:25:22,130 --> 02:25:22,371
you know,

5389
02:25:22,371 --> 02:25:22,521
like,

5390
02:25:22,521 --> 02:25:23,040
cause that's,

5391
02:25:23,040 --> 02:25:23,460
that's,

5392
02:25:23,460 --> 02:25:23,770
Yup.

5393
02:25:23,770 --> 02:25:24,060
Seems

5394
02:25:24,060 --> 02:25:24,990
like a very good question.

5395
02:25:24,991 --> 02:25:26,250
Usually photo.

5396
02:25:26,340 --> 02:25:27,151
You're very good question.

5397
02:25:27,151 --> 02:25:27,481
So let's,

5398
02:25:27,481 --> 02:25:27,870
let's,

5399
02:25:27,870 --> 02:25:28,260
let's,

5400
02:25:28,260 --> 02:25:33,260
let's search for the hoax Hillary Clinton
and everything you could do is take

5401
02:25:33,841 --> 02:25:38,160
the Hillary Clinton photo and save it
to your desktop and then Google image

5402
02:25:38,161 --> 02:25:42,270
search it and find that similar images
and see if they all have that because

5403
02:25:42,330 --> 02:25:45,690
somebody has made that a
twilight book cover for sure.

5404
02:25:45,990 --> 02:25:46,261
Okay.

5405
02:25:46,261 --> 02:25:49,500
Let's see if it's Hillary
Clinton Rockefeller alien book,

5406
02:25:49,650 --> 02:25:50,610
shades of grey,

5407
02:25:51,810 --> 02:25:52,760
50 shades of grey.

5408
02:25:53,780 --> 02:25:54,613
Mm.

5409
02:25:54,990 --> 02:25:55,800
Well there's a,

5410
02:25:55,800 --> 02:25:57,930
there's also some documents about,

5411
02:25:57,960 --> 02:25:58,793
um,

5412
02:25:59,100 --> 02:25:59,581
about,

5413
02:25:59,581 --> 02:25:59,880
uh,

5414
02:25:59,880 --> 02:26:04,410
Rockefeller wanting to talk
President Clinton into,

5415
02:26:04,411 --> 02:26:07,680
these were released by the freedom of
Information Act that Rockefeller was

5416
02:26:07,830 --> 02:26:10,320
trying to talk President Clinton into,

5417
02:26:10,321 --> 02:26:11,154
um,

5418
02:26:11,430 --> 02:26:11,881
into,

5419
02:26:11,881 --> 02:26:12,240
uh,

5420
02:26:12,240 --> 02:26:13,950
releasing information about aliens.

5421
02:26:14,580 --> 02:26:15,000
Oh really?

5422
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:15,390
Yeah.

5423
02:26:15,390 --> 02:26:18,420
And the Rockefeller was
requesting information and
they wouldn't give it to him.

5424
02:26:18,600 --> 02:26:20,160
And he had a meeting with Clinton.

5425
02:26:21,090 --> 02:26:21,301
Yeah.

5426
02:26:21,301 --> 02:26:22,620
It's just a pretty trippy man.

5427
02:26:22,860 --> 02:26:26,200
The book Laurance Rockefeller apparently
was fascinated with [inaudible].

5428
02:26:27,480 --> 02:26:27,931
He was,

5429
02:26:27,931 --> 02:26:28,764
uh,

5430
02:26:28,860 --> 02:26:29,700
the dude was,

5431
02:26:29,820 --> 02:26:30,780
he was obsessed.

5432
02:26:31,530 --> 02:26:31,741
Yeah.

5433
02:26:31,741 --> 02:26:32,431
Maybe he's just like,

5434
02:26:32,431 --> 02:26:32,820
you know,

5435
02:26:32,820 --> 02:26:33,630
just like you,

5436
02:26:33,630 --> 02:26:36,480
maybe just a little guy that
likes aliens and conspiracies.

5437
02:26:36,481 --> 02:26:36,800
Yeah.

5438
02:26:36,800 --> 02:26:38,310
It could be just that's it.

5439
02:26:38,370 --> 02:26:39,480
That's how simple it is,

5440
02:26:39,481 --> 02:26:39,990
you know,

5441
02:26:39,990 --> 02:26:44,850
except he could actually call the
government asked for cash or asked to,

5442
02:26:44,851 --> 02:26:45,330
uh,

5443
02:26:45,330 --> 02:26:46,740
to give them cash for things.

5444
02:26:47,310 --> 02:26:49,490
You mean he like
established funds and shit.

5445
02:26:49,970 --> 02:26:50,121
He,

5446
02:26:50,121 --> 02:26:51,740
along with his niece and Bartley,

5447
02:26:51,741 --> 02:26:56,270
the stepdaughter of Winthrop Rockefeller
and the then president of the

5448
02:26:56,270 --> 02:26:56,390
Rockefeller Family Fund,

5449
02:26:56,390 --> 02:27:00,860
he established the Ufo disclosure
initiative to the Clinton White House.

5450
02:27:00,950 --> 02:27:03,800
They asked for all UFO information
held by the government,

5451
02:27:03,801 --> 02:27:08,030
including from the CIA and the u s air
force to be declassified and released to

5452
02:27:08,031 --> 02:27:08,864
the public.

5453
02:27:08,990 --> 02:27:13,520
The first and most important test case
where declassification had to apply

5454
02:27:13,521 --> 02:27:16,730
according to Rockefeller was
the Roswell Ufo incident.

5455
02:27:16,850 --> 02:27:17,810
This is fascinating.

5456
02:27:17,960 --> 02:27:19,340
Like why,

5457
02:27:20,210 --> 02:27:20,751
why didn't,

5458
02:27:20,751 --> 02:27:21,230
um,

5459
02:27:21,230 --> 02:27:22,550
Greer talk about this,

5460
02:27:22,700 --> 02:27:23,900
why doesn't he know about this?

5461
02:27:24,010 --> 02:27:24,681
Cause this is all,

5462
02:27:24,681 --> 02:27:27,470
these are all government freedom
of information documents.

5463
02:27:28,520 --> 02:27:31,280
It seems like something you would be
into if you were dedicated to the cause.

5464
02:27:31,370 --> 02:27:31,581
Yeah,

5465
02:27:31,581 --> 02:27:35,150
it was in 1995 the Clintons went
to a talk to the Rockefellers.

5466
02:27:35,360 --> 02:27:37,030
It was when Hilary was,

5467
02:27:37,031 --> 02:27:37,640
uh,

5468
02:27:37,640 --> 02:27:41,600
married to bill and bill was the president
and a mother fucker gave her a book

5469
02:27:41,601 --> 02:27:42,434
on aliens.

5470
02:27:42,590 --> 02:27:43,460
Come walk with me.

5471
02:27:43,580 --> 02:27:44,150
Let's talk.

5472
02:27:44,150 --> 02:27:45,250
I want to talk to about something from,

5473
02:27:45,260 --> 02:27:49,430
talk to you about some real shit and
tell your daddy go home and tell Daddy.

5474
02:27:50,790 --> 02:27:51,623
I want to know,

5475
02:27:52,310 --> 02:27:52,850
tell,

5476
02:27:52,850 --> 02:27:54,740
tell bill till Beal.

5477
02:27:54,741 --> 02:27:57,010
I want to know what's up everyday.

5478
02:27:57,050 --> 02:27:58,790
I get to say that my dad is Dansk.

5479
02:27:59,540 --> 02:28:00,373
Yeah.

5480
02:28:01,430 --> 02:28:04,040
Creepy old fuck knows so fucking creepy.

5481
02:28:04,250 --> 02:28:05,720
And Bill Clinton apparently couldn't,

5482
02:28:05,770 --> 02:28:06,080
you know,

5483
02:28:06,080 --> 02:28:09,200
according to a Rockefeller
or according to,

5484
02:28:09,201 --> 02:28:10,034
um,

5485
02:28:10,290 --> 02:28:10,940
um,

5486
02:28:10,940 --> 02:28:12,170
the people talked about this,

5487
02:28:12,171 --> 02:28:13,040
Bill Clinton couldn't,

5488
02:28:13,100 --> 02:28:14,420
couldn't get any information out of him.

5489
02:28:14,660 --> 02:28:16,880
They didn't want to tell
him I shut him down.

5490
02:28:17,720 --> 02:28:19,010
That's one of the things
that Greer was saying.

5491
02:28:19,250 --> 02:28:20,061
Greer was saying that,

5492
02:28:20,061 --> 02:28:20,420
um,

5493
02:28:20,420 --> 02:28:21,180
these presidents,

5494
02:28:21,180 --> 02:28:21,361
like,

5495
02:28:21,361 --> 02:28:25,110
people that want to get access
to information that they don't,

5496
02:28:25,340 --> 02:28:26,760
it's not like you become president.

5497
02:28:26,761 --> 02:28:27,001
Okay,

5498
02:28:27,001 --> 02:28:27,450
come on.

5499
02:28:27,450 --> 02:28:28,260
We're going to tell you what's up.

5500
02:28:28,260 --> 02:28:28,471
Like,

5501
02:28:28,471 --> 02:28:28,741
no,

5502
02:28:28,741 --> 02:28:29,730
you don't need to know that.

5503
02:28:30,150 --> 02:28:31,380
You just need to be the president.

5504
02:28:31,470 --> 02:28:31,920
Yeah,

5505
02:28:31,920 --> 02:28:32,753
go do your shit.

5506
02:28:33,240 --> 02:28:33,631
But I'm like,

5507
02:28:33,631 --> 02:28:33,721
well,

5508
02:28:33,721 --> 02:28:34,554
who does know?

5509
02:28:34,650 --> 02:28:35,490
And then that's the real,

5510
02:28:36,060 --> 02:28:37,320
that's the real weird part.

5511
02:28:37,370 --> 02:28:38,010
Yeah.

5512
02:28:38,010 --> 02:28:38,940
If he is right,

5513
02:28:39,810 --> 02:28:42,840
that is how I think it would go
down if he's telling the truth.

5514
02:28:43,140 --> 02:28:44,790
I really do think that the people,

5515
02:28:44,791 --> 02:28:49,791
st people that can keep something as
crazy as the federal bank in place when

5516
02:28:50,251 --> 02:28:52,320
it's not really a branch of
the federal government at all,

5517
02:28:52,321 --> 02:28:53,490
but they call it the federal bank.

5518
02:28:53,790 --> 02:28:57,240
The same people that can keep the military
industrial complex moving in the same

5519
02:28:57,241 --> 02:28:58,140
rate that is moving now.

5520
02:28:58,470 --> 02:29:00,690
Those would be the people that
would know about the Ufos.

5521
02:29:00,720 --> 02:29:01,050
I mean,

5522
02:29:01,050 --> 02:29:02,070
there must be,

5523
02:29:02,610 --> 02:29:03,060
if you,

5524
02:29:03,060 --> 02:29:05,820
if you believe that
corporations control the earth,

5525
02:29:05,850 --> 02:29:10,590
which it's Kinda obvious at this
corporation from everything,

5526
02:29:10,690 --> 02:29:12,870
it's this guy to beat people at
the head of these corporations.

5527
02:29:12,940 --> 02:29:13,800
Who are these people?

5528
02:29:13,801 --> 02:29:15,870
Like these old dudes with
this fucking Ufo book.

5529
02:29:15,930 --> 02:29:16,763
Yeah.

5530
02:29:17,100 --> 02:29:17,933
So he might be right.

5531
02:29:18,150 --> 02:29:18,731
It could be right.

5532
02:29:18,731 --> 02:29:19,564
It could be right.

5533
02:29:19,760 --> 02:29:20,700
What do you think Brian's right?

5534
02:29:21,960 --> 02:29:24,690
How dare you just throw
that out there like that?

5535
02:29:24,960 --> 02:29:25,111
No,

5536
02:29:25,111 --> 02:29:26,040
I actually don't know.

5537
02:29:26,100 --> 02:29:27,060
I want to believe him by,

5538
02:29:27,070 --> 02:29:27,361
you know,

5539
02:29:27,361 --> 02:29:29,520
there's just too much fishy in my mouth.

5540
02:29:30,340 --> 02:29:32,970
There's definitely a
potential for fuckery.

5541
02:29:33,240 --> 02:29:34,190
I did a lot of fuckery.

5542
02:29:34,330 --> 02:29:36,930
That little creature thing that
drives me the most crazy cause.

5543
02:29:36,940 --> 02:29:37,773
I mean it's,

5544
02:29:37,830 --> 02:29:39,060
it's just slow to me.

5545
02:29:39,061 --> 02:29:39,571
It's just like,

5546
02:29:39,571 --> 02:29:39,811
all right,

5547
02:29:39,811 --> 02:29:39,991
wait,

5548
02:29:39,991 --> 02:29:43,740
so we're going to find out the
day that the movie releases.

5549
02:29:43,741 --> 02:29:45,690
Is that set up that way?

5550
02:29:45,720 --> 02:29:46,191
You know what I mean?

5551
02:29:46,191 --> 02:29:46,501
Thank you.

5552
02:29:46,501 --> 02:29:47,220
Said it was going to cut.

5553
02:29:47,220 --> 02:29:47,431
It was,

5554
02:29:47,431 --> 02:29:48,264
the information was coming.

5555
02:29:48,280 --> 02:29:48,960
Come out that week.

5556
02:29:48,960 --> 02:29:49,870
He got to come with me though,

5557
02:29:49,871 --> 02:29:50,180
man.

5558
02:29:50,180 --> 02:29:51,013
You gotta come.

5559
02:29:51,050 --> 02:29:51,883
What's going to be fun?

5560
02:29:52,090 --> 02:29:52,923
We should film it.

5561
02:29:53,380 --> 02:29:54,213
What are you gonna go through it?

5562
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,430
We're going to go to this
premiere premiere of his movie.

5563
02:29:57,460 --> 02:29:58,110
He definitely,

5564
02:29:58,110 --> 02:29:59,990
now I'm going to have to
wear a wig or something.

5565
02:30:00,010 --> 02:30:00,511
We can go.

5566
02:30:00,511 --> 02:30:02,940
He didn't say anything like
you said what you believe.

5567
02:30:03,750 --> 02:30:04,650
He didn't do anything wrong.

5568
02:30:05,730 --> 02:30:06,510
Prove me wrong.

5569
02:30:06,510 --> 02:30:06,751
Look,

5570
02:30:06,751 --> 02:30:10,590
the Internet is probably
predominantly on your side.

5571
02:30:10,800 --> 02:30:11,800
The Internet is pro.

5572
02:30:11,850 --> 02:30:12,840
If I had to guess.

5573
02:30:12,900 --> 02:30:14,100
I know my message board,

5574
02:30:14,400 --> 02:30:16,500
and this is no disrespect to Dr. Greer,

5575
02:30:16,590 --> 02:30:17,670
but my message board,

5576
02:30:17,700 --> 02:30:19,500
90% of them thought he was full of Shit.

5577
02:30:19,560 --> 02:30:19,980
Yeah.

5578
02:30:19,980 --> 02:30:20,813
90.

5579
02:30:21,030 --> 02:30:21,870
And I'm not bullshitting.

5580
02:30:22,110 --> 02:30:22,861
When I looked at the,

5581
02:30:22,861 --> 02:30:22,951
uh,

5582
02:30:22,951 --> 02:30:23,610
the thread,

5583
02:30:23,610 --> 02:30:27,030
it was pretty overwhelming that
most people were calling fuckery.

5584
02:30:27,210 --> 02:30:27,630
Yeah.

5585
02:30:27,630 --> 02:30:28,830
But that's again,

5586
02:30:29,010 --> 02:30:30,960
when you make an extraordinary claim,

5587
02:30:30,990 --> 02:30:32,820
you have to provide
extraordinary evidence.

5588
02:30:32,821 --> 02:30:34,980
And if you don't have that
extraordinary evidence,

5589
02:30:34,981 --> 02:30:37,080
it becomes very difficult
to convince people.

5590
02:30:37,290 --> 02:30:40,230
So if he really did have these experiences
and he really does know all this

5591
02:30:40,231 --> 02:30:41,064
information,

5592
02:30:41,160 --> 02:30:42,240
that's all well and good,

5593
02:30:43,020 --> 02:30:46,390
but you can't go around telling
people unless you have something

5594
02:30:46,580 --> 02:30:47,000
Shelby,

5595
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:47,833
the hard evidence,

5596
02:30:48,050 --> 02:30:48,880
I don't want to hear it.

5597
02:30:48,880 --> 02:30:49,050
And,

5598
02:30:49,050 --> 02:30:49,671
and it can't be,

5599
02:30:49,671 --> 02:30:52,430
you have to open the
store and take this ride.

5600
02:30:52,460 --> 02:30:54,160
You got to be able to just
show people harder than,

5601
02:30:54,200 --> 02:30:54,381
I mean,

5602
02:30:54,381 --> 02:30:55,050
I guess you do.

5603
02:30:55,050 --> 02:30:58,460
What do you do though for an alien really
does abducted you really does take you

5604
02:30:58,461 --> 02:31:02,360
away if you really do know what the fuck
do you do if there is no evidence that

5605
02:31:02,361 --> 02:31:03,101
you can get what I'm saying.

5606
02:31:03,101 --> 02:31:05,210
If your best evidence is watch my film,

5607
02:31:05,990 --> 02:31:09,500
then it leads people to
embrace not believing you.

5608
02:31:09,550 --> 02:31:10,130
Yeah,

5609
02:31:10,130 --> 02:31:10,650
I agree.

5610
02:31:10,650 --> 02:31:11,483
You know?

5611
02:31:11,590 --> 02:31:16,590
And right now it looks like that DNA
test to find out like a simple basic DNA

5612
02:31:17,061 --> 02:31:20,100
test to see if it's something
is human or it takes less

5613
02:31:20,100 --> 02:31:20,933
than 24 hours,

5614
02:31:21,900 --> 02:31:23,910
less than 24 hours to find
out if something's human.

5615
02:31:23,911 --> 02:31:24,180
Yeah.

5616
02:31:24,180 --> 02:31:25,170
Meaning like if I,

5617
02:31:25,171 --> 02:31:27,030
if I threw a piece of Bologna
at you and you're like,

5618
02:31:27,031 --> 02:31:27,331
oh my God,

5619
02:31:27,331 --> 02:31:28,164
that's a human,

5620
02:31:28,230 --> 02:31:29,970
you can take it to the
DNA lab and they'll go,

5621
02:31:29,971 --> 02:31:30,151
no,

5622
02:31:30,151 --> 02:31:30,960
it's Baloney.

5623
02:31:30,960 --> 02:31:31,793
Hmm.

5624
02:31:32,050 --> 02:31:32,800
Okay.

5625
02:31:32,800 --> 02:31:37,180
So would they be able to distinguish
between an animal and I'm like a monkey

5626
02:31:37,181 --> 02:31:40,000
baby or a monkey fetus or a human feet?

5627
02:31:40,001 --> 02:31:40,710
Would they be like,

5628
02:31:40,710 --> 02:31:41,543
yeah,

5629
02:31:41,670 --> 02:31:44,840
it's pretty much you
just the human markup,

5630
02:31:44,870 --> 02:31:45,680
you know,

5631
02:31:45,680 --> 02:31:47,700
d our human DNA is,

5632
02:31:47,940 --> 02:31:48,990
what's the smallest monkey?

5633
02:31:49,920 --> 02:31:51,060
Uh,

5634
02:31:51,260 --> 02:31:52,093
what's his name?

5635
02:31:52,230 --> 02:31:52,801
This is a real,

5636
02:31:52,801 --> 02:31:53,810
it's a really tiny monkey,

5637
02:31:53,811 --> 02:31:54,200
right?

5638
02:31:54,200 --> 02:31:56,670
There's a tiny spider monkey there.

5639
02:31:57,010 --> 02:31:57,771
They're way bigger.

5640
02:31:57,771 --> 02:31:59,300
There's some really small primates.

5641
02:31:59,900 --> 02:32:01,940
What it maybe it was like a dried out,

5642
02:32:01,941 --> 02:32:02,910
really small crime.

5643
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:06,380
I mean it doesn't necessarily have
to be even a human finger monkey.

5644
02:32:06,830 --> 02:32:09,360
I wonder how long it would take to
find out whether or not something like,

5645
02:32:10,640 --> 02:32:10,911
wow,

5646
02:32:10,911 --> 02:32:11,840
look how small that is.

5647
02:32:12,700 --> 02:32:13,190
Yeah,

5648
02:32:13,190 --> 02:32:14,300
that's pretty small.

5649
02:32:15,490 --> 02:32:15,770
Yeah,

5650
02:32:15,770 --> 02:32:16,760
and if that was all like,

5651
02:32:16,850 --> 02:32:19,760
oh it's hair fell off
and some of the its tail.

5652
02:32:20,210 --> 02:32:20,901
That's what it looked like.

5653
02:32:20,901 --> 02:32:22,100
That came out of my belly button.

5654
02:32:22,910 --> 02:32:24,140
That probably lives in your asshole.

5655
02:32:24,560 --> 02:32:25,820
Probably don't even know about it.

5656
02:32:26,390 --> 02:32:27,230
He lives in there.

5657
02:32:27,500 --> 02:32:28,820
It's like a mouse in the house.

5658
02:32:29,030 --> 02:32:30,230
The happiest little monkey.

5659
02:32:30,740 --> 02:32:33,010
He's got a little fucking set up in there.

5660
02:32:34,480 --> 02:32:35,070
Brian's ass.

5661
02:32:35,070 --> 02:32:36,170
He's got a barrier.

5662
02:32:36,320 --> 02:32:41,320
He sets up whenever Brian's taking a
shit cause past it blocks off in the area

5663
02:32:41,721 --> 02:32:44,210
that he's got cordoned off
in Brian's after his house.

5664
02:32:46,370 --> 02:32:47,520
He helps jungle hot,

5665
02:32:47,640 --> 02:32:48,530
push the shit out.

5666
02:32:49,630 --> 02:32:50,870
Do you have a hard time shifting Brian?

5667
02:32:50,900 --> 02:32:51,201
No.

5668
02:32:51,201 --> 02:32:53,300
It's almost like someone's
pushing it because someone is,

5669
02:32:53,301 --> 02:32:58,301
you've got to fucking little monkey man
with a shovel and puppet shit out of

5670
02:32:59,191 --> 02:32:59,290
here.

5671
02:32:59,290 --> 02:33:00,650
I don't act like he wouldn't enjoy it.

5672
02:33:00,680 --> 02:33:01,610
Stop shaking your head.

5673
02:33:02,240 --> 02:33:04,640
This monkey my ass too late.

5674
02:33:06,830 --> 02:33:07,011
All right,

5675
02:33:07,011 --> 02:33:07,970
let's go get some neat.

5676
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:09,020
It's fucking shows over.

5677
02:33:09,320 --> 02:33:09,980
Tommy [inaudible].

5678
02:33:09,980 --> 02:33:11,390
How can people get your,

5679
02:33:11,391 --> 02:33:11,720
uh,

5680
02:33:11,720 --> 02:33:12,370
your uh,

5681
02:33:12,370 --> 02:33:12,870
CD?

5682
02:33:12,870 --> 02:33:13,141
Oh,

5683
02:33:13,141 --> 02:33:17,790
you can go to Tom cigarette.com and click
on the store or you can go to iTunes.

5684
02:33:17,820 --> 02:33:18,653
Powerful iTunes,

5685
02:33:18,660 --> 02:33:19,500
powerful iTunes.

5686
02:33:20,130 --> 02:33:22,980
And My site also has a link to,

5687
02:33:23,010 --> 02:33:23,370
um,

5688
02:33:23,370 --> 02:33:26,190
if you don't use iTunes because people
are always want an option that's not

5689
02:33:26,191 --> 02:33:26,730
iTunes.

5690
02:33:26,730 --> 02:33:27,151
Right?

5691
02:33:27,151 --> 02:33:27,631
There's a link.

5692
02:33:27,631 --> 02:33:30,630
You can download it from CD
baby on a link on my site.

5693
02:33:30,670 --> 02:33:31,503
Nice.

5694
02:33:31,680 --> 02:33:35,880
Christina and I are going to do
alive your mom's house comedy tour.

5695
02:33:36,090 --> 02:33:37,950
So we're going to Seattle,

5696
02:33:38,190 --> 02:33:38,760
um,

5697
02:33:38,760 --> 02:33:39,630
May 18th,

5698
02:33:39,720 --> 02:33:40,231
and then,

5699
02:33:40,231 --> 02:33:40,490
uh,

5700
02:33:40,490 --> 02:33:41,880
I think we're going to
do Portland the next day,

5701
02:33:41,881 --> 02:33:43,620
but the Seattle link is up.

5702
02:33:43,621 --> 02:33:44,130
I just tweeted,

5703
02:33:44,130 --> 02:33:47,980
are you doing both comedy and
also just lifestyle lifestyle,

5704
02:33:48,350 --> 02:33:48,721
a lot.

5705
02:33:48,721 --> 02:33:49,290
Podcasts.

5706
02:33:49,290 --> 02:33:50,123
Excuse me.

5707
02:33:50,760 --> 02:33:51,280
Just to know.

5708
02:33:51,280 --> 02:33:52,760
Podcasts can,

5709
02:33:52,770 --> 02:33:54,060
I'm saying it's the two of us.

5710
02:33:54,061 --> 02:33:55,200
We don't ever ride together.

5711
02:33:55,910 --> 02:33:56,690
It's the two.

5712
02:33:56,690 --> 02:33:57,280
That's awesome.

5713
02:33:57,280 --> 02:33:57,661
Really Fun.

5714
02:33:57,661 --> 02:33:58,790
So it should be a good time.

5715
02:33:58,791 --> 02:33:59,910
I've never done that before.

5716
02:34:00,040 --> 02:34:00,550
Really.

5717
02:34:00,550 --> 02:34:02,490
I always thought you guys would
have done that a long time ago.

5718
02:34:02,520 --> 02:34:02,720
Yeah.

5719
02:34:02,720 --> 02:34:03,061
I mean,

5720
02:34:03,061 --> 02:34:06,330
because of the popularity of your podcasts
you allowed to put together shit like

5721
02:34:06,331 --> 02:34:07,080
this.

5722
02:34:07,080 --> 02:34:08,160
It's all from the podcast.

5723
02:34:08,161 --> 02:34:09,720
He's just done the hundredth episode.

5724
02:34:09,721 --> 02:34:11,760
I heard and I heard you
had an awesome guests.

5725
02:34:11,790 --> 02:34:12,600
Red Banded our,

5726
02:34:12,600 --> 02:34:13,590
we did our hundredth episode,

5727
02:34:13,591 --> 02:34:13,840
man.

5728
02:34:13,840 --> 02:34:16,680
We talked about how you are the
one that got us started with it.

5729
02:34:16,681 --> 02:34:17,351
So that was pretty cool.

5730
02:34:17,351 --> 02:34:18,040
I'm so happy.

5731
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:18,611
I'm so happy.

5732
02:34:18,611 --> 02:34:23,611
Did and so have you been experiencing
a lot more people coming out to fans of

5733
02:34:23,831 --> 02:34:24,670
the show is definitely.

5734
02:34:25,290 --> 02:34:26,123
And there's a best fans.

5735
02:34:26,410 --> 02:34:28,570
They're the most amazing
people at the shows.

5736
02:34:28,870 --> 02:34:29,800
So yeah,

5737
02:34:29,801 --> 02:34:30,130
I got,

5738
02:34:30,130 --> 02:34:31,030
I got a bunch of,

5739
02:34:31,031 --> 02:34:31,360
um,

5740
02:34:31,360 --> 02:34:31,931
it's been great.

5741
02:34:31,931 --> 02:34:36,130
And our goal is to get to the point where
we can do what we're doing in Seattle

5742
02:34:36,190 --> 02:34:38,860
and I'm in a bunch of different places.

5743
02:34:38,861 --> 02:34:39,420
Yeah.

5744
02:34:39,420 --> 02:34:39,910
Um,

5745
02:34:39,910 --> 02:34:42,220
and still play like the good
clubs that we love playing,

5746
02:34:42,221 --> 02:34:45,520
but try to take a little more control
of where we're doing it and what we're

5747
02:34:45,521 --> 02:34:45,821
doing.

5748
02:34:45,821 --> 02:34:46,270
You know?

5749
02:34:46,270 --> 02:34:46,541
I mean,

5750
02:34:46,541 --> 02:34:49,440
you should be able to book
shit now because your,

5751
02:34:49,441 --> 02:34:51,610
your podcast has been going
on for a couple of years now.

5752
02:34:52,090 --> 02:34:52,923
How many years?

5753
02:34:53,080 --> 02:34:53,530
It's a,

5754
02:34:53,530 --> 02:34:54,670
we're over two.

5755
02:34:54,700 --> 02:34:56,380
So we're going into our third year.

5756
02:34:56,760 --> 02:34:57,100
Yeah.

5757
02:34:57,100 --> 02:34:57,933
That's strong.

5758
02:34:57,940 --> 02:34:59,020
So yeah,

5759
02:34:59,140 --> 02:35:01,840
it's amazing how if you just stick
with something all of a sudden,

5760
02:35:01,900 --> 02:35:02,230
boom.

5761
02:35:02,230 --> 02:35:03,100
There's two years con.

5762
02:35:03,150 --> 02:35:03,370
Yeah.

5763
02:35:03,370 --> 02:35:04,360
With us three.

5764
02:35:04,600 --> 02:35:05,290
It's crazy.

5765
02:35:05,290 --> 02:35:06,480
We're three years in that.

5766
02:35:06,490 --> 02:35:07,210
And you guys,

5767
02:35:07,210 --> 02:35:08,140
I remember doing,

5768
02:35:08,200 --> 02:35:11,410
I was telling somebody I'm
on one of your first 15.

5769
02:35:11,470 --> 02:35:11,801
Yeah.

5770
02:35:11,801 --> 02:35:13,060
Sitting on a couch.

5771
02:35:13,090 --> 02:35:13,480
Yeah.

5772
02:35:13,480 --> 02:35:14,770
And I just remember we'd lean up.

5773
02:35:14,771 --> 02:35:15,011
You're like,

5774
02:35:15,011 --> 02:35:15,940
sit closer to the mic man.

5775
02:35:17,140 --> 02:35:18,560
Sit back and then you're like say close.

5776
02:35:19,120 --> 02:35:20,500
But I kept scooching back.

5777
02:35:20,501 --> 02:35:20,891
But yeah.

5778
02:35:20,891 --> 02:35:22,780
And then now you have
a whole goddamn studio.

5779
02:35:22,820 --> 02:35:22,961
Yeah.

5780
02:35:22,961 --> 02:35:24,820
We resisted it for a long time.

5781
02:35:24,850 --> 02:35:26,170
They really embraced it now.

5782
02:35:26,230 --> 02:35:26,741
Now.

5783
02:35:26,741 --> 02:35:27,230
Yeah.

5784
02:35:27,230 --> 02:35:28,120
Well now it's,

5785
02:35:28,121 --> 02:35:28,540
um,

5786
02:35:28,540 --> 02:35:31,150
it's more important
than anything else I do.

5787
02:35:31,450 --> 02:35:32,110
I know.

5788
02:35:32,110 --> 02:35:33,580
Now it's more important than,

5789
02:35:34,060 --> 02:35:34,960
I mean it's really,

5790
02:35:34,961 --> 02:35:38,200
I hate to say it's more important than
the UFC as far as like for my standup

5791
02:35:38,201 --> 02:35:38,860
gigs,

5792
02:35:38,860 --> 02:35:40,930
it's way more important like this,

5793
02:35:40,931 --> 02:35:41,081
uh,

5794
02:35:41,081 --> 02:35:41,914
this weekend,

5795
02:35:42,100 --> 02:35:42,761
one of the things,

5796
02:35:42,761 --> 02:35:44,000
it's a trippy is a,

5797
02:35:44,010 --> 02:35:44,740
our buddy,

5798
02:35:44,740 --> 02:35:46,560
Tony's era from the,

5799
02:35:46,570 --> 02:35:50,410
our message board came down this weekend
and it was interesting hearing him talk

5800
02:35:50,411 --> 02:35:52,060
about the difference in the shows.

5801
02:35:52,270 --> 02:35:53,860
Like he used to come see me at,

5802
02:35:53,861 --> 02:35:54,220
uh,

5803
02:35:54,220 --> 02:35:55,900
the punchline when I was there,

5804
02:35:55,930 --> 02:35:56,111
you know,

5805
02:35:56,111 --> 02:35:57,250
the punchline and Columbus,

5806
02:35:57,251 --> 02:35:57,901
what isn't funny?

5807
02:35:57,901 --> 02:36:00,310
Bone Columbus funnybone
funny bone and kilometers,

5808
02:36:00,311 --> 02:36:01,060
great club.

5809
02:36:01,060 --> 02:36:02,080
There's a little tiny place,

5810
02:36:02,500 --> 02:36:05,800
but this time we're at the palace
theater and there's fucking 2,400 people

5811
02:36:05,801 --> 02:36:06,100
there.

5812
02:36:06,100 --> 02:36:06,510
It was,

5813
02:36:06,510 --> 02:36:07,121
it was crazy.

5814
02:36:07,121 --> 02:36:07,571
Huge.

5815
02:36:07,571 --> 02:36:08,110
Yeah.

5816
02:36:08,110 --> 02:36:10,690
And it's this beautiful a place
in it's packed and he was like,

5817
02:36:10,720 --> 02:36:11,830
the nutty thing was like,

5818
02:36:11,831 --> 02:36:16,000
people were so nice and friendly
and between all the jokes,

5819
02:36:16,001 --> 02:36:17,470
everybody was like real quiet,

5820
02:36:17,480 --> 02:36:18,313
respectful.

5821
02:36:18,460 --> 02:36:18,761
He goes,

5822
02:36:18,761 --> 02:36:19,720
it was nuts.

5823
02:36:19,930 --> 02:36:20,261
He goes,

5824
02:36:20,261 --> 02:36:21,370
it was fucking nuts.

5825
02:36:21,371 --> 02:36:22,091
Everyone's got desk,

5826
02:36:22,091 --> 02:36:24,850
quad tee shirts on or higher
prime eight tee shirts.

5827
02:36:24,851 --> 02:36:26,050
It's like this crazy.

5828
02:36:26,140 --> 02:36:27,070
It's pretty positive,

5829
02:36:27,071 --> 02:36:31,750
fun environment and all of
that's attributed to the podcast.

5830
02:36:31,751 --> 02:36:33,970
It's all attributable to people that,

5831
02:36:33,971 --> 02:36:34,770
you know,

5832
02:36:34,770 --> 02:36:36,070
they've seen the podcast,

5833
02:36:36,071 --> 02:36:38,920
they've seen her stand up like
it's changed everything man.

5834
02:36:38,920 --> 02:36:39,341
It changes.

5835
02:36:39,341 --> 02:36:43,690
The world has changed the world
for is constantly rattling off.

5836
02:36:43,750 --> 02:36:45,400
If you haven't seen Diaz's podcast,

5837
02:36:45,550 --> 02:36:47,170
it's the church of what's happening now.

5838
02:36:47,290 --> 02:36:48,790
You could get it on iTunes.

5839
02:36:49,050 --> 02:36:50,800
If you'd go to mad flavor on Twitter,

5840
02:36:50,801 --> 02:36:52,450
you can find out when
he's doing them alive.

5841
02:36:52,480 --> 02:36:54,040
I did his a weeks ago,

5842
02:36:54,700 --> 02:36:59,700
told me a story about when he went to
football camp as a kid and it was Jack

5843
02:36:59,830 --> 02:37:00,431
Lambert football camp.

5844
02:37:00,431 --> 02:37:01,390
You Remember Jack Lambert?

5845
02:37:01,490 --> 02:37:01,711
No.

5846
02:37:01,711 --> 02:37:03,040
Is it very famous?

5847
02:37:03,190 --> 02:37:05,490
Pittsburgh Steeler linebacker w uh,

5848
02:37:05,680 --> 02:37:08,110
like had his teeth missing
cause he was such a fucking,

5849
02:37:08,130 --> 02:37:08,440
you know,

5850
02:37:08,440 --> 02:37:08,950
animal.

5851
02:37:08,950 --> 02:37:09,670
Yeah.

5852
02:37:09,670 --> 02:37:14,670
And he walked into the bathroom and
Jack Lambert was taking a shit in one of

5853
02:37:14,831 --> 02:37:17,660
those old school locker rooms where
they don't have doors on the style.

5854
02:37:17,680 --> 02:37:18,260
Right.

5855
02:37:18,260 --> 02:37:21,470
And that he was shaving
in the shit water and

5856
02:37:23,420 --> 02:37:25,520
almost fucking had a heart attack.

5857
02:37:26,120 --> 02:37:27,680
So that's old school.

5858
02:37:27,710 --> 02:37:29,440
If you want to laugh your Dick off,

5859
02:37:30,170 --> 02:37:32,660
go to go to Joey's,

5860
02:37:32,830 --> 02:37:36,410
a church of what's happening now where
I'm a guest on and he tells that story

5861
02:37:36,680 --> 02:37:37,820
and it's Piss your pants.

5862
02:37:37,880 --> 02:37:39,710
I'm going to get that and
listened to on the way home.

5863
02:37:39,740 --> 02:37:40,680
It's so fun.

5864
02:37:41,270 --> 02:37:42,350
The iPod APP,

5865
02:37:42,380 --> 02:37:47,150
the iPhone podcast APP is amazing.

5866
02:37:47,151 --> 02:37:47,750
He's awesome.

5867
02:37:47,750 --> 02:37:48,920
I was bored with people,

5868
02:37:48,921 --> 02:37:50,360
Shit that I had on my iPod.

5869
02:37:50,990 --> 02:37:51,470
Why?

5870
02:37:51,470 --> 02:37:54,350
I Dunno like horrible reviews.

5871
02:37:54,351 --> 02:37:55,161
I think it's great.

5872
02:37:55,161 --> 02:37:55,641
I think there's,

5873
02:37:55,641 --> 02:37:56,181
I have no problem.

5874
02:37:56,181 --> 02:37:57,170
I mean I use stitcher,

5875
02:37:57,171 --> 02:37:59,900
but people hate everything
to hate themselves.

5876
02:38:00,230 --> 02:38:03,860
90% of the hate you getting out of
all these people in line is they hate

5877
02:38:03,861 --> 02:38:04,694
themselves.

5878
02:38:05,190 --> 02:38:06,470
I went to a restaurant the other day,

5879
02:38:06,471 --> 02:38:10,880
they got three stars and I read the
reviews like so many people would just

5880
02:38:10,881 --> 02:38:11,740
shitting on it to.

5881
02:38:11,750 --> 02:38:14,810
It was amazing because I
had heard it was amazing.

5882
02:38:14,900 --> 02:38:15,290
People like,

5883
02:38:15,290 --> 02:38:17,270
oh there's this new
Italian restaurant opened.

5884
02:38:17,271 --> 02:38:18,104
It's so good.

5885
02:38:18,140 --> 02:38:19,010
It's not cheap.

5886
02:38:19,040 --> 02:38:19,520
I mean it's,

5887
02:38:19,520 --> 02:38:20,151
it's pricey,

5888
02:38:20,151 --> 02:38:22,550
but the dishes were fantastic in la.

5889
02:38:22,940 --> 02:38:24,360
It's out in um,

5890
02:38:24,590 --> 02:38:25,460
like West hills,

5891
02:38:25,970 --> 02:38:28,580
but it was a like five star restaurants,

5892
02:38:28,660 --> 02:38:29,990
like in my eyes I was like,

5893
02:38:30,050 --> 02:38:30,231
wow,

5894
02:38:30,231 --> 02:38:31,340
this place is amazing.

5895
02:38:31,340 --> 02:38:32,360
It's really good.

5896
02:38:32,480 --> 02:38:34,370
The Pasta was fresh pasta,

5897
02:38:34,610 --> 02:38:34,821
you know,

5898
02:38:34,821 --> 02:38:35,630
it's like the way they,

5899
02:38:35,630 --> 02:38:35,811
I mean,

5900
02:38:35,811 --> 02:38:36,980
it was legit.

5901
02:38:37,360 --> 02:38:38,540
Then I read the reviews.

5902
02:38:38,570 --> 02:38:40,400
It's like people are just constant.

5903
02:38:40,460 --> 02:38:43,100
People get upset about restaurants
when they didn't get the seat,

5904
02:38:43,101 --> 02:38:45,400
when they thought they were
going to get it though one star.

5905
02:38:45,450 --> 02:38:46,160
Absolutely.

5906
02:38:46,160 --> 02:38:47,070
This is a fucking shit.

5907
02:38:47,090 --> 02:38:48,530
There was a hostess and you're like,

5908
02:38:48,550 --> 02:38:48,980
all right,

5909
02:38:48,980 --> 02:38:49,910
or waiter spilled water,

5910
02:38:49,940 --> 02:38:50,990
Lonestar fuck you.

5911
02:38:52,340 --> 02:38:53,810
But in the podcast APP,

5912
02:38:54,020 --> 02:38:54,531
I'm like,

5913
02:38:54,531 --> 02:38:56,660
the other day I was in my car and I said,

5914
02:38:56,661 --> 02:38:57,230
you know what,

5915
02:38:57,230 --> 02:39:00,050
I'd like to listen to Dan
Carlin's hardcore history.

5916
02:39:00,290 --> 02:39:02,300
So I'm at a fucking red light.

5917
02:39:02,360 --> 02:39:03,193
Okay.

5918
02:39:03,380 --> 02:39:04,213
And I go,

5919
02:39:04,230 --> 02:39:04,641
I have time,

5920
02:39:04,641 --> 02:39:04,800
man,

5921
02:39:04,800 --> 02:39:07,910
the single parent real quick at a red
light and the time that it took for the

5922
02:39:07,911 --> 02:39:08,480
light to create,

5923
02:39:08,480 --> 02:39:09,500
I go hardcore history,

5924
02:39:09,530 --> 02:39:10,100
doom.

5925
02:39:10,100 --> 02:39:13,310
It opens up Mongols think play bank play,

5926
02:39:13,400 --> 02:39:13,940
play.

5927
02:39:13,940 --> 02:39:17,900
It's playing and it's playing on
my fucking car through Bluetooth.

5928
02:39:18,110 --> 02:39:18,943
Just like that.

5929
02:39:19,040 --> 02:39:20,520
Instantly streaming tomatoes.

5930
02:39:20,570 --> 02:39:21,230
Perfect,

5931
02:39:21,230 --> 02:39:22,250
not a glitch in it.

5932
02:39:22,370 --> 02:39:23,840
And for the next hour home,

5933
02:39:23,841 --> 02:39:26,240
I listened to the history
of the Mongol Empire,

5934
02:39:26,450 --> 02:39:26,870
uh,

5935
02:39:26,870 --> 02:39:28,040
which is fascinating.

5936
02:39:28,310 --> 02:39:29,870
Dan Carlin's hardcore history.

5937
02:39:29,960 --> 02:39:33,000
We had them as a guest on the podcast
a couple of weeks ago and now I'm a,

5938
02:39:33,010 --> 02:39:34,050
I'm addicted to his,

5939
02:39:34,051 --> 02:39:34,250
uh,

5940
02:39:34,250 --> 02:39:34,971
his podcast.

5941
02:39:34,971 --> 02:39:39,290
It's excellent to me if you're into
like crazy stories about history and the

5942
02:39:39,291 --> 02:39:41,670
wars and this whole
shit about Gingiss con,

5943
02:39:41,690 --> 02:39:43,250
this is a series that
he's doing right now.

5944
02:39:43,251 --> 02:39:44,084
It's hot.

5945
02:39:44,870 --> 02:39:45,651
It's so nuts.

5946
02:39:45,651 --> 02:39:46,280
I was only 12,

5947
02:39:46,280 --> 02:39:46,881
1200.

5948
02:39:46,881 --> 02:39:47,440
There was a few,

5949
02:39:47,440 --> 02:39:48,261
a few hundred years ago.

5950
02:39:48,261 --> 02:39:50,930
This motherfucker was just
carving its way across the world.

5951
02:39:51,200 --> 02:39:51,351
Yeah,

5952
02:39:51,351 --> 02:39:52,200
I'd love to listen to that.

5953
02:39:52,250 --> 02:39:53,083
Amazing.

5954
02:39:53,280 --> 02:39:56,390
And I got it immediately at a
red light with that podcast APP.

5955
02:39:56,391 --> 02:39:57,680
So if you don't like the podcast App,

5956
02:39:57,681 --> 02:40:02,681
go fuck your soul and introduces you to
the podcasting to so many fans too that

5957
02:40:03,440 --> 02:40:04,940
you didn't know existed.

5958
02:40:04,941 --> 02:40:06,620
Like you always tend to think of,

5959
02:40:06,621 --> 02:40:06,921
I mean,

5960
02:40:06,921 --> 02:40:10,330
you've had obviously like
way more exposure and,

5961
02:40:10,331 --> 02:40:10,761
and you know,

5962
02:40:10,761 --> 02:40:11,660
being on television,

5963
02:40:11,661 --> 02:40:12,410
but like,

5964
02:40:12,410 --> 02:40:13,950
you forget like when you do

5965
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:15,900
just the podcasts that,

5966
02:40:16,050 --> 02:40:16,381
you know,

5967
02:40:16,381 --> 02:40:19,740
there's people downloading
it in all over Canada,

5968
02:40:20,040 --> 02:40:21,240
all over Australia,

5969
02:40:21,241 --> 02:40:23,580
UK and like all over the world,

5970
02:40:23,610 --> 02:40:26,640
all over the world and that and
that now like we can go and do like,

5971
02:40:26,641 --> 02:40:30,510
I'm going to do Toronto and
it's all because of the podcast.

5972
02:40:30,720 --> 02:40:33,090
I'm doing that underground comedy club.

5973
02:40:33,690 --> 02:40:34,710
I heard a place is awesome.

5974
02:40:34,820 --> 02:40:35,670
That's fucking awesome.

5975
02:40:35,671 --> 02:40:37,630
I'm going there in May talking.

5976
02:40:37,710 --> 02:40:38,610
Just got back from there.

5977
02:40:38,640 --> 02:40:39,031
Yes.

5978
02:40:39,031 --> 02:40:40,950
He said it was a fucking
incredible experience.

5979
02:40:41,070 --> 02:40:42,180
I'm so excited to go.

5980
02:40:42,181 --> 02:40:43,710
I'm going to get really weak early in May.

5981
02:40:43,820 --> 02:40:47,000
You and the beautiful
thing about podcasts and,

5982
02:40:47,030 --> 02:40:47,360
uh,

5983
02:40:47,360 --> 02:40:50,420
the impact of podcasts is that it,

5984
02:40:50,570 --> 02:40:52,910
if people don't like the podcast,

5985
02:40:53,210 --> 02:40:54,320
it's not successful.

5986
02:40:54,410 --> 02:40:55,400
It's really that simple,

5987
02:40:55,401 --> 02:40:55,700
right?

5988
02:40:55,700 --> 02:40:56,270
They don't,

5989
02:40:56,270 --> 02:40:58,850
they don't take off
unless people like them.

5990
02:40:58,990 --> 02:40:59,360
So it's,

5991
02:40:59,360 --> 02:41:00,800
no one's promoting it.

5992
02:41:01,100 --> 02:41:02,450
It's totally democratic.

5993
02:41:02,451 --> 02:41:03,860
It's totally organic.

5994
02:41:03,861 --> 02:41:06,650
It totally ha it either
happens or it doesn't happen.

5995
02:41:06,651 --> 02:41:07,400
Right.

5996
02:41:07,400 --> 02:41:09,320
So the two people that enjoy our podcast.

5997
02:41:09,350 --> 02:41:10,183
Thank you very much.

5998
02:41:10,220 --> 02:41:11,420
We appreciate the fuck out of it.

5999
02:41:11,421 --> 02:41:12,254
I know you do.

6000
02:41:12,420 --> 02:41:13,150
You have some shade.

6001
02:41:13,150 --> 02:41:13,820
Absolutely.

6002
02:41:13,820 --> 02:41:17,150
It's like the greatest opportunity to
have your own show that could have ever

6003
02:41:17,151 --> 02:41:17,710
existed.

6004
02:41:17,710 --> 02:41:18,170
Absolutely.

6005
02:41:18,170 --> 02:41:18,890
There's nothing else.

6006
02:41:18,890 --> 02:41:20,990
Nothing else that comes close to
giving you the kind of freedom.

6007
02:41:21,260 --> 02:41:22,220
We're number one right now.

6008
02:41:22,790 --> 02:41:23,470
No.

6009
02:41:23,470 --> 02:41:25,360
And all comedy podcasts suck.

6010
02:41:25,860 --> 02:41:26,630
Suck,

6011
02:41:26,630 --> 02:41:27,463
suck,

6012
02:41:28,200 --> 02:41:29,990
suck upon it.

6013
02:41:30,020 --> 02:41:30,261
Uh,

6014
02:41:30,261 --> 02:41:30,621
but we're,

6015
02:41:30,621 --> 02:41:31,341
we're very happy,

6016
02:41:31,341 --> 02:41:33,200
so thank you everybody
that came out this weekend.

6017
02:41:33,230 --> 02:41:33,650
Um,

6018
02:41:33,650 --> 02:41:33,980
uh,

6019
02:41:33,980 --> 02:41:34,813
Brian say thanks.

6020
02:41:34,900 --> 02:41:35,261
Yes,

6021
02:41:35,261 --> 02:41:36,250
thank you very much.

6022
02:41:36,280 --> 02:41:37,240
Everyone was so nice,

6023
02:41:37,241 --> 02:41:40,540
so nice and a pretty powerful death squad.

6024
02:41:41,090 --> 02:41:41,921
A group there.

6025
02:41:41,921 --> 02:41:45,310
They'd have a hundred people before
the show even started met at this.

6026
02:41:45,370 --> 02:41:46,203
Uh,

6027
02:41:46,220 --> 02:41:46,961
it's weird.

6028
02:41:46,961 --> 02:41:47,740
They're starting to like,

6029
02:41:47,740 --> 02:41:49,360
like chapters in every state.

6030
02:41:49,600 --> 02:41:50,120
Organic,

6031
02:41:50,120 --> 02:41:50,421
Ricky,

6032
02:41:50,421 --> 02:41:52,010
completely organic desk.

6033
02:41:52,070 --> 02:41:52,903
Quite Ohio,

6034
02:41:52,920 --> 02:41:54,190
Connecticut called Florida.

6035
02:41:54,191 --> 02:41:55,110
Completely organic.

6036
02:41:55,390 --> 02:41:56,200
I hear you.

6037
02:41:56,200 --> 02:41:57,033
We have Juggalos.

6038
02:41:57,470 --> 02:41:57,890
Yeah,

6039
02:41:57,890 --> 02:41:59,020
we basically have juggalos.

6040
02:41:59,080 --> 02:41:59,470
Yeah,

6041
02:41:59,470 --> 02:42:00,570
we have a new type of juggle.

6042
02:42:00,571 --> 02:42:00,681
Oh,

6043
02:42:00,681 --> 02:42:01,750
though it's like fight club.

6044
02:42:01,810 --> 02:42:02,430
They're nice.

6045
02:42:02,430 --> 02:42:03,290
They get their shit together.

6046
02:42:03,790 --> 02:42:04,750
Eating Kale shakes,

6047
02:42:04,990 --> 02:42:05,800
lifting weights.

6048
02:42:05,800 --> 02:42:08,260
I talked to a hundred people that
lost fucking a hundred pounds or more.

6049
02:42:08,290 --> 02:42:08,561
I mean,

6050
02:42:08,561 --> 02:42:09,250
I'm not joking.

6051
02:42:09,250 --> 02:42:09,610
I keep,

6052
02:42:09,610 --> 02:42:12,520
I talked to 30 people this weekend
instead of changed their life.

6053
02:42:12,980 --> 02:42:15,120
And it happens every time we do shows the,

6054
02:42:15,280 --> 02:42:16,960
the weirdness of it all.

6055
02:42:16,961 --> 02:42:20,060
And the unexpectedness of it all
is the inspirational aspect of it.

6056
02:42:20,061 --> 02:42:21,700
I never thought that
that was going to happen.

6057
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:25,000
Never thought that people are going
to take these crazy rants just getting

6058
02:42:25,001 --> 02:42:27,550
pissed off and talking shit about
things or breaking things down and take,

6059
02:42:27,551 --> 02:42:30,700
take them and put them into youtube clips
and then those youtube clips would get

6060
02:42:30,701 --> 02:42:32,020
hundreds of thousands of views.

6061
02:42:32,350 --> 02:42:32,681
I mean,

6062
02:42:32,681 --> 02:42:34,000
it's millions or some of them.

6063
02:42:34,001 --> 02:42:34,211
It's,

6064
02:42:34,211 --> 02:42:34,660
it's,

6065
02:42:34,660 --> 02:42:35,680
it's really crazy.

6066
02:42:35,681 --> 02:42:36,370
It's incredible.

6067
02:42:36,370 --> 02:42:37,001
It's incredible.

6068
02:42:37,001 --> 02:42:38,080
And I don't know how it happened.

6069
02:42:38,081 --> 02:42:38,980
You affect people's lives,

6070
02:42:39,010 --> 02:42:39,430
but it's,

6071
02:42:39,430 --> 02:42:39,821
it's,

6072
02:42:39,821 --> 02:42:41,410
it's all organic.

6073
02:42:41,440 --> 02:42:43,390
It was no one ever
planned to do any of this.

6074
02:42:43,391 --> 02:42:45,400
And that's the most
beautiful thing about it.

6075
02:42:45,940 --> 02:42:46,271
Uh,

6076
02:42:46,271 --> 02:42:47,770
I'm headed right now from here.

6077
02:42:47,771 --> 02:42:49,460
We're going to get some neat
and then I'm going to go do,

6078
02:42:49,461 --> 02:42:49,830
um,

6079
02:42:49,830 --> 02:42:50,050
uh,

6080
02:42:50,050 --> 02:42:51,190
David shows podcasts.

6081
02:42:51,460 --> 02:42:52,300
Looking forward to that.

6082
02:42:52,460 --> 02:42:53,111

It's awesome.

6121
02:43:52,090 --> 02:43:52,220
Oh,

6122
02:43:52,220 --> 02:43:55,530
I have to Yoshi people that
are asking me about Montreal.

6123
02:43:55,560 --> 02:43:59,160
Montreal was sold out a long time ago.

6124
02:43:59,310 --> 02:44:00,510
I'm there with powerful,

6125
02:44:00,511 --> 02:44:05,460
Ari should fear we're
doing the gym comedy club.

6126
02:44:05,880 --> 02:44:08,010
It's the tiniest little place.

6127
02:44:08,310 --> 02:44:10,620
It seats like no bullshit.

6128
02:44:10,650 --> 02:44:12,300
Like I don't even think
it seats a hundred people.

6129
02:44:12,301 --> 02:44:12,780
Really?

6130
02:44:12,780 --> 02:44:13,380
Yeah.

6131
02:44:13,380 --> 02:44:15,090
The last time I was there I did.

6132
02:44:15,110 --> 02:44:15,540
Um,

6133
02:44:15,540 --> 02:44:16,261
the palladium,

6134
02:44:16,261 --> 02:44:18,510
I think it's called like two 2100 people.

6135
02:44:18,520 --> 02:44:20,050
And then you're doing a tiny yeah.

6136
02:44:20,060 --> 02:44:20,281
Yeah.

6137
02:44:20,281 --> 02:44:21,570
But it's my friend Jimbo.

6138
02:44:21,960 --> 02:44:22,680
See,

6139
02:44:22,680 --> 02:44:26,430
I've been working for Jimbo for,

6140
02:44:26,820 --> 02:44:29,280
since I think I first worked
for him in [inaudible] 92.

6141
02:44:29,540 --> 02:44:30,990
[inaudible] 93.

6142
02:44:31,230 --> 02:44:31,800
Yeah,

6143
02:44:31,800 --> 02:44:32,910
it's somewhere around then.

6144
02:44:32,920 --> 02:44:34,740
It was before I ever moved to California.

6145
02:44:34,920 --> 02:44:36,060
I was living in New York.

6146
02:44:36,110 --> 02:44:36,943
This is really cool.

6147
02:44:36,960 --> 02:44:37,793
And uh,

6148
02:44:37,830 --> 02:44:39,120
he's just the nicest guy ever.

6149
02:44:39,330 --> 02:44:40,410
And he's so nice.

6150
02:44:40,440 --> 02:44:42,870
I alternate whenever I do Montreal,

6151
02:44:43,140 --> 02:44:43,980
when I do Montreal,

6152
02:44:43,981 --> 02:44:46,910
I'd do a big theater and then
the next time I come in town,

6153
02:44:46,911 --> 02:44:47,670
it's a few months later,

6154
02:44:47,670 --> 02:44:48,271
whatever it is,

6155
02:44:48,271 --> 02:44:49,890
I do his tiny club.

6156
02:44:50,010 --> 02:44:50,730
That's cool.

6157
02:44:50,730 --> 02:44:51,540
Yeah.

6158
02:44:51,540 --> 02:44:52,430
That's so good.

6159
02:44:52,431 --> 02:44:53,580
It's fun for me.

6160
02:44:53,640 --> 02:44:54,061
You know,

6161
02:44:54,061 --> 02:44:55,080
it's fun to do.

6162
02:44:55,140 --> 02:44:56,730
It's a cool ass place,

6163
02:44:57,030 --> 02:44:59,220
but unfortunately it's sold out pitch.

6164
02:44:59,250 --> 02:45:00,001
That's really cool.

6165
02:45:00,001 --> 02:45:00,300
Joe.

6166
02:45:00,300 --> 02:45:01,020
You've got way cooler.

6167
02:45:01,020 --> 02:45:01,370
It's,

6168
02:45:01,370 --> 02:45:02,220
it's an awesome place.

6169
02:45:02,400 --> 02:45:06,660
And then the 22nd and the 23rd is the
next time on the road I'm going to be,

6170
02:45:06,661 --> 02:45:08,190
it's Zucchinis in Nashville,

6171
02:45:08,191 --> 02:45:09,270
another small club.

6172
02:45:09,570 --> 02:45:14,570
I got a gang of new shit that I'm working
on and so I decided to book myself in

6173
02:45:14,761 --> 02:45:16,440
a really small place and uh,

6174
02:45:16,480 --> 02:45:19,200
[inaudible] and Nashville
is fucking great.

6175
02:45:19,220 --> 02:45:19,950
It's,

6176
02:45:19,950 --> 02:45:22,110
that's a the 22nd and 23rd.

6177
02:45:22,590 --> 02:45:23,011
Um,

6178
02:45:23,011 --> 02:45:23,761
so that's,

6179
02:45:23,761 --> 02:45:24,330
um,

6180
02:45:24,330 --> 02:45:26,420
I'm just trying to like,

6181
02:45:26,460 --> 02:45:27,810
put all this shit into a form.

6182
02:45:27,811 --> 02:45:28,331
I'm going to try it.

6183
02:45:28,331 --> 02:45:30,510
I'm trying to do my
next special in August.

6184
02:45:30,830 --> 02:45:31,310
He really,

6185
02:45:31,310 --> 02:45:31,680
yeah.

6186
02:45:31,680 --> 02:45:32,080
Damn.

6187
02:45:32,080 --> 02:45:33,300
I'm trying to figure out where to do it.

6188
02:45:33,510 --> 02:45:33,721
Yeah,

6189
02:45:33,721 --> 02:45:35,760
I've got an hour and 20 minutes now.

6190
02:45:36,280 --> 02:45:36,620
This,

6191
02:45:36,620 --> 02:45:37,620
this past weekend,

6192
02:45:37,650 --> 02:45:38,670
it was so solid.

6193
02:45:38,671 --> 02:45:40,650
It was like this new shit that I have.

6194
02:45:40,651 --> 02:45:43,110
It's like a lot of it is
ideas that I've had before.

6195
02:45:43,111 --> 02:45:45,000
I just didn't know where
to put them and you know,

6196
02:45:45,001 --> 02:45:46,650
so it's coming along really quick,

6197
02:45:46,800 --> 02:45:47,790
so I figured fuck it.

6198
02:45:48,090 --> 02:45:50,040
Let's get that ball rolling again.

6199
02:45:50,240 --> 02:45:50,880
That's cause I,

6200
02:45:50,880 --> 02:45:51,630
yeah,

6201
02:45:51,630 --> 02:45:52,291
cause I want to,

6202
02:45:52,291 --> 02:45:52,860
um,

6203
02:45:52,860 --> 02:45:53,520
I want to,

6204
02:45:53,520 --> 02:45:58,230
I have a new process that I'm doing and
one of the new processes is a work on

6205
02:45:58,231 --> 02:46:00,770
what I have now add to
it but also stockpile.

6206
02:46:00,780 --> 02:46:02,280
So I'm doubling up on my writing.

6207
02:46:02,790 --> 02:46:07,320
So I'm trying to have four
big writing sessions a week.

6208
02:46:07,440 --> 02:46:10,280
That's my goal is to get for like major

6209
02:46:10,280 --> 02:46:11,180
writing sessions a week.

6210
02:46:11,181 --> 02:46:11,751
So three days,

6211
02:46:11,751 --> 02:46:12,351
I don't read it all,

6212
02:46:12,351 --> 02:46:14,900
but for several hour writing sessions,

6213
02:46:14,930 --> 02:46:15,381
just write,

6214
02:46:15,381 --> 02:46:15,560
write,

6215
02:46:15,560 --> 02:46:18,170
write one blog a week.

6216
02:46:18,200 --> 02:46:19,400
So that's my other new goal.

6217
02:46:19,460 --> 02:46:21,890
Is your writing session
just freeform writing.

6218
02:46:21,891 --> 02:46:22,551
Just like whatever.

6219
02:46:22,551 --> 02:46:23,850
Like to sit down stream of conscious.

6220
02:46:23,860 --> 02:46:24,051
Yeah,

6221
02:46:24,051 --> 02:46:25,070
whatever I want to write about.

6222
02:46:25,100 --> 02:46:25,460
That's cool.

6223
02:46:25,460 --> 02:46:26,090
Yeah.

6224
02:46:26,090 --> 02:46:26,871
It could be sports,

6225
02:46:26,871 --> 02:46:27,710
could be my deck.

6226
02:46:28,290 --> 02:46:30,470
Could be poop deck with your sports.

6227
02:46:30,480 --> 02:46:32,030
Could Be Dick and poop with sports.

6228
02:46:32,031 --> 02:46:32,450
Yeah.

6229
02:46:32,450 --> 02:46:33,560
That sounds like a good show.

6230
02:46:33,620 --> 02:46:34,450
That's a good show.

6231
02:46:34,450 --> 02:46:35,930
Dick and poop with sports,

6232
02:46:36,200 --> 02:46:36,921
that's like a good,

6233
02:46:36,921 --> 02:46:40,400
like over two radio guys that talk shit
and don't want anybody to know their

6234
02:46:40,401 --> 02:46:40,860
name.

6235
02:46:40,860 --> 02:46:42,080
I'm Dick and this is poop.

6236
02:46:42,081 --> 02:46:42,821
We're dicking poop.

6237
02:46:42,821 --> 02:46:43,654
It's sports.

6238
02:46:43,930 --> 02:46:44,361
All right,

6239
02:46:44,361 --> 02:46:45,020
you fox.

6240
02:46:45,020 --> 02:46:45,351
Listen,

6241
02:46:45,351 --> 02:46:46,490
we love the shit out of you people.

6242
02:46:46,670 --> 02:46:47,231
And uh,

6243
02:46:47,231 --> 02:46:47,491
we,

6244
02:46:47,491 --> 02:46:48,770
we appreciate all of your support.

6245
02:46:48,771 --> 02:46:49,650
We appreciate all the,

6246
02:46:49,651 --> 02:46:49,781
the,

6247
02:46:49,781 --> 02:46:51,560
the positive energy that we get.

6248
02:46:51,560 --> 02:46:52,550
I say this all the time,

6249
02:46:52,551 --> 02:46:53,600
but I can't say it enough.

6250
02:46:53,630 --> 02:46:54,410
It's a,

6251
02:46:54,410 --> 02:46:55,850
we feel incredibly fortunate.

6252
02:46:55,851 --> 02:46:57,830
It's a very unusual place to be in,

6253
02:46:57,831 --> 02:46:58,370
in life.

6254
02:46:58,370 --> 02:46:58,761
And,

6255
02:46:58,761 --> 02:46:59,510
uh,

6256
02:46:59,510 --> 02:46:59,991
you know,

6257
02:46:59,991 --> 02:47:00,510
um,

6258
02:47:00,510 --> 02:47:01,050
I,

6259
02:47:01,050 --> 02:47:05,540
I understand that and I appreciate
that and I'm very thankful.

6260
02:47:05,840 --> 02:47:06,051
Uh,

6261
02:47:06,051 --> 02:47:07,550
so people keep coming to,

6262
02:47:07,551 --> 02:47:09,110

6263
02:47:09,111 --> 02:47:11,450
I've never stopped doing
