1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,250

3

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,180
something's going to happen.

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,540
Something you think if
anybody could do it.

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,290
Um,

7
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:19,200

a long time and he's had a couple of

8
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:19,401
them,

9
00:00:19,401 --> 00:00:22,550

Silva find the shame that I have,

10
00:00:22,551 --> 00:00:25,850

day and I watch the count down and watch

11
00:00:25,851 --> 00:00:26,930

13
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,780
I'm not saying he's
going to beat Jon Jones,

14
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,050
but I probably experiences
on motherfucker.

15
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,110

thing before supplements.

00:01:25,591 --> 00:01:26,610
you got to eat healthy food.

38
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,260
That's number one.

39
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:28,801
Number two,

40
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:29,940

and then start fucking
around with vitamins.

48
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,410

00:01:49,621 --> 00:01:51,030
You fucking freak bitches.

60
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,111
I didn't get the hemp.

61
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:52,710
You as a good,

62
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,070
oh,

63
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:53,903
it's delicious.

64
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,360
Oh,

65
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,510
it's the best tasting stuff ever.

66
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,850
What's its flavor it with Stevia?

67
00:01:56,851 --> 00:01:57,750
So it was no sugar in it.

68
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,730
It's like we'll only one gram of sugar.

69
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,380
It's a raw cocoa.

70
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,210
It's a Maca,

71
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,770
which is like something's supposed to,

72
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,110
it's supposed to enhance your sexuality,

73
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:08,670
supposed to fire you up.

74
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,833
I don't know if it works.

75
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:10,681
Uh,

76
00:02:10,681 --> 00:02:11,341
and then,

77
00:02:11,341 --> 00:02:11,910
um,

78
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:12,661
there's a,

79
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:13,770
the Stevia,

80
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,070
Stevia is used as the sweetener
for the show hemp chocolate,

81
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,413
chocolate,

82
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,320
and it's the finest quality
hemp hearts available.

83
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,870
We just went and got the best shit and
we could only buy 50 pounds of it a day.

84
00:02:24,871 --> 00:02:25,704
It's Kinda crazy.

85
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,240
We can't grow it in America.

86
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,110
It's not,

87
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,070
you can't get high on it.

88
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,180
You can't test positive.

89
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:30,861
Like people say if,

90
00:02:30,861 --> 00:02:31,290
um,

91
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,490
what if I get tested for work?

92
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,720
You cannot test positive,

93
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:35,100
but oddly enough,

94
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,020
if you eat poppy seed bagels,

95
00:02:37,021 --> 00:02:38,790
you do test positive for heroin.

96
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,830
It's kind of crazy halfway house.

97
00:02:40,831 --> 00:02:41,580
They tell you that.

98
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:41,791
Yeah.

99
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,260
You can not eat poppy seed bagels,

100
00:02:43,261 --> 00:02:45,150
but you can take hemp protein powder.

101
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:45,511
It doesn't,

102
00:02:45,511 --> 00:02:45,991
it's not,

103
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:47,370
there's no THC in it,

104
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,870
but it's illegal to grow anyway.

105
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,790
It's our government's way
of fucking you in the ass.

106
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:51,624
If you're a farmer,

107
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,450
it's a great crop and we have
to buy it from Canadians.

108
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,070
It's fucking ridiculous.

109
00:02:56,071 --> 00:02:57,690
It has nothing to do with marijuana.

110
00:02:57,691 --> 00:03:00,610
It's completely non you.

111
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:00,970
Uh,

112
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:01,840
you eat it.

113
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:02,740
It's healthy.

114
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:03,611
It's a,

115
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:04,870
it's got a lot of protein in.

116
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:06,940
It contains the essential amino acids.

117
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:09,430
It's a great fiber for
making clothes with,

118
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:10,960
and he can go on and on and on about the,

119
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,910
the benefits of industrial hemp,

120
00:03:12,911 --> 00:03:14,320
hemp as a commodity.

121
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:15,461
But there's a,

122
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,020
there's some creepy shit going on that,

123
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:19,090
that's illegal because it makes no sense.

124
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:20,560
It doesn't have anything to do.

125
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:24,640
Even a little bit has nothing
to do with getting high.

126
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:25,361
It's a,

127
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:27,250
it's a really fucking creepy racket,

128
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:31,630
but it's one that this government
is all caught up in your fucks.

129
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:32,080
Anyway,

130

You can open it.

147
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:55,871

00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,310
Pretty high.

00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:28,531
What's up?

172
00:04:28,531 --> 00:04:28,980
Beautiful.

173
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:29,221
Hey,

174
00:04:29,221 --> 00:04:31,950
we got a good podcast with Mac Danzig
and we're waiting for Billy Corbin,

175
00:04:31,951 --> 00:04:32,371
who was the,

176
00:04:32,371 --> 00:04:32,910
uh,

177
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,350
director of cocaine cowboys.

178
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:35,620
And then I looked down at my phone.

179
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,440
He had been telling me
that he had to cancel.

180
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,320
So you were close by.

181
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:39,571
He said,

182
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:39,871
fuck it,

183
00:04:39,871 --> 00:04:41,020
let's drop in any way.

184
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,130
Bummed out that I was getting on the one
34 when he called the first time and I

185
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,670
just gotten the right hand lane right.

186
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:50,110
And I just did 65 like
the rest of the civilians.

187
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,580
When you called back,

188
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:56,250
I wasn't on forest lawn and I fucking
kick that into that Hov lane and I had

189
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,650
sons of anarchy behind Matt,

190
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:58,960
this black bike about him.

191
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,930
So I knew what the cops are going to pull
anybody that he was going down first.

192
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,100
He was my beer.

193
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,060
I got in front of him in the Hov Lane
and I just shot that motherfucker.

194
00:05:07,061 --> 00:05:09,610
Hell bent for free all the way
till you called me and said,

195
00:05:09,611 --> 00:05:10,444
Nah,

196
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:10,811
we're going to,

197
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:11,230
and I said,

198
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:11,800
hold on.

199
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,940
I'm back in the Hov lane and I went
through cars and there was an unmarked

200
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,860
police car and the right hand lane.

201
00:05:17,861 --> 00:05:18,694
He didn't even see me.

202
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,280
I just slipped right back behind him.

203
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,400
I took my time after that.

204
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,240
He just,

205
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,180
it's 65 like a fucking sat.

206
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:24,400
Yeah.

207
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,990
That's like a thing that we do out here.

208
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:28,270
He was like your roll
the dice in the Hov Lane,

209
00:05:28,271 --> 00:05:30,400
400 400 bucks,

210
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,820
64 60 and if you call
it a licensing point,

211
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,080
like when I go for it,

212
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:35,620
I go for,

213
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,340
I go for the nine 20th package.

214
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:41,650
Most of the 920 hour package that
she go over the line and you find,

215
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:45,130
because you can only cut into Hov
where the lines say you're permitted.

216
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,350
So I do the nine 60 package,

217
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,950
which nine pointy in court
altogether court costs.

218
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,010
You got to drop a hundred for
the victim compensation fund,

219
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,890
another hundred from the deaf
kids from Chinese society.

220
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,130
You're going to run into a by

221
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:02,740
16 halala about minivans and
fucking southern California.

222
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,640
That makes them think they
should be in the left lane.

223
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:08,030
Kills you people anywhere in
this great country of laws.

224
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:08,741
When you drive in,

225
00:06:08,741 --> 00:06:11,990
there's somebody doing 65 and the
left hand get out of your way,

226
00:06:11,991 --> 00:06:12,621
get out of your way.

227
00:06:12,621 --> 00:06:13,640
Only in California,

228
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:15,750
they'll sit there and fucking
tore menu and they'll,

229
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,890
they'll give you the finger like they
don't think that they should have to move.

230
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,920
It's something that never made it
out here and back where I grew up,

231
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,260
the,

232
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,870
the highways were more narrow.

233
00:06:23,871 --> 00:06:26,990
Like there was a lot of two lane
highways so it was just good,

234
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,910
good citizenship.

235
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:29,331
You know,

236
00:06:29,331 --> 00:06:30,081
getting out of the lane,

237
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:31,040
there was only two lanes.

238
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,120
So if you're in the left lane,

239
00:06:32,121 --> 00:06:32,901
you're trying to go fast.

240
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:33,570
If you're in the right lane,

241
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:34,403
you're going slow.

242
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,340
But these douchebags have
this wealth of lanes,

243
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:37,701
you know,

244
00:06:37,701 --> 00:06:37,801
they,

245
00:06:37,801 --> 00:06:38,571
they have six,

246
00:06:38,571 --> 00:06:38,931
seven,

247
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:39,490
eight lanes.

248
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,150
So you can go run me,

249
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,680
we'll just go around me.

250
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,600
Why don't you just not
be in the fast lane,

251
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:49,190
you twat lane number two and do 65
minimum yield going 60 miles an hour in a

252
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:49,941
minivan.

253
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:51,410
And you're mad that people don't,

254
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,760
don't want you in their way.

255
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:53,720
That's ridiculous.

256
00:06:53,721 --> 00:06:55,130
You don't have to be in the left lane.

257
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,330
That's for passing people.

258
00:06:56,331 --> 00:06:56,841
You stupid.

259
00:06:56,841 --> 00:06:57,560
Fuck.

260
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,780
And the worst is like a,

261
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,110
when I go up north,

262
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,351
I'm like,

263
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:03,490
when you go up north and the one
on one after you pass a certain,

264
00:07:03,491 --> 00:07:04,111
it's beautiful.

265
00:07:04,111 --> 00:07:05,420
It opens right to fuck up.

266
00:07:05,421 --> 00:07:07,160
It's beautiful driving and he,

267
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:08,810
you are doing fucking Haiti.

268
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:09,920
You're on cruise.

269
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:14,530
You got the Eagle's Hotel California
and you get behind the fucking seven 50

270
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,690
that's doing 65 and that's
when you start to burn.

271
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:18,681
I'm thinking to myself,

272
00:07:18,681 --> 00:07:19,191
for starters,

273
00:07:19,191 --> 00:07:20,690
he's a Jew driving a German car.

274
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,530
I'll confused this.

275
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,170
Cox,

276
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:25,080
Cox mother fuckers got no loyalty Shit,

277
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:25,971
right?

278
00:07:25,971 --> 00:07:26,721
That's number one.

279
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:27,554
Number two.

280
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:28,551
Number two,

281
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:32,720
he's doing 65 [inaudible] seven cards
because the only reason I would buy a

282
00:07:32,721 --> 00:07:36,440
seven series if when a cop pulls me
over back to rip the ticket in his face,

283
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:37,910
all my attorney,

284
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:41,180
that's the only way I would drive a
seven if I could do 90 all the time,

285
00:07:41,181 --> 00:07:41,690
Joe.

286
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:41,991
It's not,

287
00:07:41,991 --> 00:07:43,010
I don't see the beauty in it.

288
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,053
I don't see it.

289
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:47,400
Unless you're going to do 90 then it's
okay to give me this like a seven series,

290
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:49,780
five dose.

291
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,110
You should shoot yourself.

292
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,790
That's a Toyota fucking Corolla.

293
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:53,810
You just paid more.

294
00:07:53,811 --> 00:07:54,980
You want to impress people,

295
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,270
you know after your dope dude,

296
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,750
you're talking about
this three series BMW.

297
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:03,350
I have an m three nine but you have
an m three I say fucking difference.

298
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,213
It's a beautiful,

299
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,000
I love that.

300
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,080
But the people that get to
three holding onto that,

301
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:08,990
I'm famous to cars.

302
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:12,890
Joe Has a three fucking
thing that drives brilliant,

303
00:08:12,891 --> 00:08:16,540
but there's some people can't afford
the three that ghetto basically good for

304
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,480
fucking Lexis fucking rx.

305
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,610
A smaller one than that.

306
00:08:19,611 --> 00:08:19,950
They haven't.

307
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,540
Why?

308
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,850
They were tiny one and they have an I am.

309
00:08:22,851 --> 00:08:25,570
It's just like tiny little buzz mo mobile.

310
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,070
But it looks like a fact that
you all told me that in push.

311
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:28,491
Yeah,

312
00:08:28,491 --> 00:08:29,000
the one that,

313
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
how much of that porch grow wholesale
rethink a hundred he's got a 900 901 which

314
00:08:34,221 --> 00:08:35,390
is the newest generation.

315
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:36,610
It's more than a hundred okay.

316
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,610
That's a Carrera.

317
00:08:37,611 --> 00:08:40,190
So he might be able to get that one for
less than a hundred it's not the career

318
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,550
ass.

319
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,200
You pull me all with
that car and I'm like,

320
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:42,431
yes,

321
00:08:42,431 --> 00:08:42,921
sure officer.

322
00:08:42,921 --> 00:08:44,120
Do you know how fast she was doing?

323
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:47,060
It doesn't matter because
this is how I do it.

324
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,281
What license?

325
00:08:49,281 --> 00:08:50,350
I don't have what we ended up picking.

326
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,440
You rip it up.

327
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:51,981
You give it to them.

328
00:08:51,981 --> 00:08:53,370
You give them the name
of your fucking attorney.

329
00:08:53,371 --> 00:08:55,780
He's got a Yamaka on it
with a stock going to it.

330
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:56,030
Here you

331
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:56,520
go.

332
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,600
Call Him in 10 minutes.

333
00:08:57,601 --> 00:09:00,670
I'll tell you what the shooting
star coming out of the picture.

334
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,760
Jesus bleeding on the floor and shit.

335
00:09:02,761 --> 00:09:03,310
Hit.

336
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:03,900
Remember that?

337
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,290
All right,

338
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,123
got stuck.

339
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,050
Take this cock sucker.

340
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,200
You're going to pull me off with
doing 90 I'm in northern California.

341
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,780
You know when you get up
here it's beautiful to drive.

342
00:09:12,781 --> 00:09:15,090
You can't know six in the
morning and do your thing.

343
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:15,481
Yeah,

344
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:17,820
but that area is filled
with cops waiting the bag.

345
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,690
I've seen it and I got pulled over one
night on the one 30 cause there's pilots.

346
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:25,560
When you're coming from the one old one
noise where it becomes hilly and you get

347
00:09:25,561 --> 00:09:27,570
caught up on those
motherfucking hills late night,

348
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,710
you got the music on,

349
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,150
you're listening to the radio,

350
00:09:30,151 --> 00:09:30,571
whatever.

351
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:31,800
You're on the phone with your buddies.

352
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,050
When you go over that hill,

353
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:33,391
look at you.

354
00:09:33,391 --> 00:09:34,130
It's predominant.

355
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:34,500
Yeah.

356
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,910
You're doing 90 yeah,

357
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:36,630
by mistake.

358
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,910
You know really you're doing
90 they come right behind you.

359
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:39,391
Yeah.

360
00:09:39,391 --> 00:09:40,800
There's a lot of spots where they wait.

361
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:46,050
We ride to San Francisco was fucking
parking ticket central driving,

362
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,510
speeding ticket central
and you got to really,

363
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,120
you got to stick to the law
of the vagueness around La.

364
00:09:51,121 --> 00:09:52,650
That's the one leniency we have.

365
00:09:52,651 --> 00:09:55,470
There's not that many cops was ticket city

366
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:57,363
bold.

367
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:57,970
Really?

368
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:58,803
I'm Connie.

369
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,360
I'm a fucking hippie loving cock suckers.

370
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:06,190
Not Though the cops in bold the had this
thing by a and they were telling me the

371
00:10:06,191 --> 00:10:07,120
statistic once.

372
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,630
It was like one of the highest
on the Nash National Average.

373
00:10:10,631 --> 00:10:11,970
This isn't the 80s right.

374
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,140
But I'm that one Irish Irish
takes you into Longmont.

375
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,241
Okay.

376
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,010
On Irish in between,

377
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:18,520
uh,

378
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,930
28th and 30th street.

379
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,760
They would now more people.

380
00:10:21,761 --> 00:10:22,660
It was like a Nashville.

381
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:26,620
They just sit there by the mental health
center and they get you on that 20 with

382
00:10:26,621 --> 00:10:27,371
the blinking light.

383
00:10:27,371 --> 00:10:29,080
35 cause if you ain't used to that,

384
00:10:29,081 --> 00:10:29,980
you don't know what's cracking.

385
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:30,700
Right.

386
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,420
So you don't even see that 35 you're
doing 35 watts and you see plenty.

387
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:35,591
Bam.

388
00:10:35,591 --> 00:10:36,790
That's how they get you right there.

389
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:37,150
Boom.

390
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:37,600
I got,

391
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,320
I got nailed on that 35
20 that's really cool.

392
00:10:40,321 --> 00:10:41,230
And I went to court,

393
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,480
they told me in court they're like,

394
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:43,840
oh you fell for the fucking,

395
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,730
they have a name for it
and boulder at the time,

396
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,873
the alley,

397
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:47,770
that's where they

398
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:48,430
just,

399
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,440
so it's a setup.

400
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:49,691
It's,

401
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:49,781
it's,

402
00:10:49,781 --> 00:10:50,860
it's almost like the,

403
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,540
the transition is so quick.

404
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,300
It's designed just to give you a ticket

405
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,540
or else I just was at with it.

406
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:00,960
They said be careful because
the transition Nashville,

407
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,430
when you're going from Nashville,

408
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,271
Chattanooga,

409
00:11:03,271 --> 00:11:04,890
we were talking one day and they go dog,

410
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,560
they kill motherfuckers.

411
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:07,550
There really is,

412
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,160
it goes from 75 to 60 within a
minute and you don't see in the cops.

413
00:11:11,161 --> 00:11:11,994
It's right there.

414
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:14,311
Hey man,

415
00:11:14,311 --> 00:11:14,960
you got to get through.

416
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,060
No,

417
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:15,980
for the states and towns,

418
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:20,340
there's a much more of a police state in
other places than there is here when it

419
00:11:20,341 --> 00:11:21,001
comes to that,

420
00:11:21,001 --> 00:11:23,310
when it comes to speeding
and shit like that.

421
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,870
Like I remember in Connecticut,

422
00:11:24,871 --> 00:11:27,990
like Connecticut state troopers
were brutal because they all,

423
00:11:27,991 --> 00:11:29,300
they had to do that everyday.

424
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,480
They're just pulling people over.

425
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,560
That's what they're looking for.

426
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,240
That's their number one crime.

427
00:11:33,241 --> 00:11:36,270
They're just trying to pull people
over and write them tickets as much as

428
00:11:36,271 --> 00:11:36,840
possible.

429
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,790
They become glorified revenue collectors.

430
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:39,520
It's really rich,

431
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,970
especially rich white
people in the rich areas.

432
00:11:41,971 --> 00:11:42,420
They just,

433
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,070
they don't give a fuck and just sit there.

434
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,301
It's crazy.

435
00:11:45,301 --> 00:11:49,950
The cops actually have a quota that
they have to make and it's been exposed

436
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:50,311
like,

437
00:11:50,311 --> 00:11:51,120
uh,

438
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,451
the,

439
00:11:51,451 --> 00:11:51,870
uh,

440
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:52,470
they were,

441
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,680
they were offering price.

442
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,580
It was in California.

443
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:56,650
There was some something
that we're offering,

444
00:11:56,651 --> 00:11:56,890
you know,

445
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,900
officers something more.

446
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,310
If they got more rests.

447
00:12:00,311 --> 00:12:00,581
It was,

448
00:12:00,581 --> 00:12:02,530
it was proven that
they've got more tickets,

449
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:05,410
that they would get some benefit from it.

450
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,640
But you know,

451
00:12:06,641 --> 00:12:09,640
you're not allowed to do that
because would have nobody drives.

452
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,880
Nobody speeds at all and you
have to write 10 tickets a day,

453
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:13,743
but what if everybody's,

454
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,170
we're assuming that everyone's
going to break the law,

455
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:21,010
and if that's not the case that you
don't have a job because that's your job

456
00:12:21,011 --> 00:12:21,401
basically,

457
00:12:21,401 --> 00:12:23,290
every day you're going out
there and you're parking,

458
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,750
you're waiting for people
to go by and speed.

459
00:12:25,751 --> 00:12:25,901
Well,

460
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:27,850
if nobody speeds anymore,

461
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,230
everybody just quits.

462
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,450
How do you make that
10 ticketed day quota?

463
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:32,290
We'll get don't.

464
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:32,741
Well,

465
00:12:32,741 --> 00:12:34,030
what the fuck happens then?

466
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,480
What happens in you pull
over people for bullshit,

467
00:12:37,481 --> 00:12:38,620
the fake tickets.

468
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:39,520
I mean,

469
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,300
is it possible that we can get to a point
where nobody's doing anything illegal

470
00:12:43,301 --> 00:12:45,610
anymore and we don't need traffic cops?

471
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:47,560
If that happens,

472
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,760
the fuck are they going
to do with all that?

473
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:49,301
What they need,

474
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:49,751
that money,

475
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:51,430
they've got that built into the budget.

476
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,930
The amount of tickets they get,

477
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,190
they build that into the budget.

478
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:55,120
They know it's coming in.

479
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:55,571
They know,

480
00:12:55,571 --> 00:12:55,811
well,

481
00:12:55,811 --> 00:12:56,171
we get it.

482
00:12:56,171 --> 00:12:56,401
You know,

483
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:56,740
I don't know.

484
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,950
I don't have to pay the tickets awake.

485
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,110
Sally does have those.

486
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,200
That's $100,000 for this
common ala is brutal.

487
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,093
It's crazy.

488
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:03,940
That's why I'm in La.

489
00:13:03,941 --> 00:13:04,960
I see like budgets.

490
00:13:04,961 --> 00:13:05,990
They talk about how they're,

491
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:10,150
they go shut down the system for three
days a week and four days a week that

492
00:13:10,151 --> 00:13:10,984
they're out of money.

493
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,820
I just go to Hollywood and look around.

494
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:17,350
That's a moneymaking machine and Hollywood
and they got those black chicks or

495
00:13:17,351 --> 00:13:22,351
the angry angry sisters driving them
ticket motherfucking cause those angry

496
00:13:22,471 --> 00:13:25,660
hangry sisters that
left her with four kids.

497
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,500
She got rickets,

498
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:26,921
you know,

499
00:13:26,921 --> 00:13:27,820
Shit like that.

500
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:31,090
I mean these sisters are beautiful
and they're driving around dog.

501
00:13:31,091 --> 00:13:31,420
I had it.

502
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:34,810
I had a car in Hollywood that was
given to me and they never gave me the

503
00:13:34,811 --> 00:13:38,830
registration and the registration
expired and they would hunt me down.

504
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:42,280
Did you know that really it would just
drive around and give me a ticket every

505
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,040
day just on spike for the registration.

506
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:46,810
They make that motherfucking
quoted that way.

507
00:13:46,811 --> 00:13:47,511
Let me tell you something.

508
00:13:47,511 --> 00:13:48,190
In La,

509
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:52,060
the biggest thing when you move to
Hollywood is your first 90 days you get

510
00:13:52,061 --> 00:13:52,840
banged up.

511
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,470
I got my,

512
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,960
I got Stan hoax car towed
him one night by mistake.

513
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,000
Really parked it by on sunset.

514
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,460
I mean it's fucking ridiculous down there.

515
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,810
They will destroy you.

516
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,060
It feels like the kind of have
to be on top of everything.

517
00:14:04,061 --> 00:14:04,181
No,

518
00:14:04,181 --> 00:14:06,760
there's so many people there
and there's so many dirt bags.

519
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,623
Oh my God.

520
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,150
They have people living in Hollywood,

521
00:14:10,151 --> 00:14:10,840
like the percentage,

522
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,640
like there's a lot of
Nice people in Hollywood.

523
00:14:12,641 --> 00:14:15,250
I know know a lot of like
really normal people.

524
00:14:15,251 --> 00:14:18,010
Folks would be surprised
when you meet like folks,

525
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:22,600
people who actually live in West Hollywood
and have like a little house in West

526
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:22,720
Hollywood.

527
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,070
I met some really wonderful,

528
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,030
nice people there,

529
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:29,860
but there's also a giant percentage
of crazy fucks in that city.

530
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,120
There's a lot of them,

531
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:31,931
young kids,

532
00:14:31,931 --> 00:14:33,340
they move here after college.

533
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,260
Their parents give them a credit card,

534
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:36,110
go out there,

535
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,430
you know whatever you do till
the credit cards over though.

536
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:41,620
We've seen at the store how many people
come and go with just having this

537
00:14:41,621 --> 00:14:43,210
conversation this morning at breakfast,

538
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,710
how many people went,

539
00:14:44,711 --> 00:14:45,544
came at,

540
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,170
had seven great minutes,

541
00:14:47,171 --> 00:14:48,460
went to Montreal,

542
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,460
got a deal for a quarter of a Mil,

543
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,070
fucking late nineties two

544
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,770
thousands and once
they'd fucking got down,

545
00:14:54,771 --> 00:14:55,850
they went to the Improv.

546
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:59,270
They got sandwiched in between Joe Rogan
and Nick Dipaolo one night and they

547
00:14:59,271 --> 00:15:01,760
realize how bad they
really were and they said,

548
00:15:01,761 --> 00:15:02,330
you know what,

549
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:06,890
I'm going to go back and re run daddy's
fucking transmission shop because the

550
00:15:06,891 --> 00:15:07,190
work,

551
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:07,880
and I've seen it,

552
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,290
how many people came and went to this?

553
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,930
You've been here people that
we're going to be stars.

554
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:12,501
Yeah,

555
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:13,490
there was a lot of that.

556
00:15:13,491 --> 00:15:14,510
That's definitely happened.

557
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,880
I think it's easy to lose your,

558
00:15:16,881 --> 00:15:17,714
your way,

559
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,471
lose your,

560
00:15:18,471 --> 00:15:19,340
your intention.

561
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,510
It's easy to,

562
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:25,610
it's easy to just fucking get
caught up in the fear of it all.

563
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:25,941
You know,

564
00:15:25,941 --> 00:15:29,570
the uncertainty of it all and
just get swept away in it,

565
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,220
which that happens a lot of people,

566
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:31,970
man.

567
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:32,391
A lot of people,

568
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:34,550
they just can't ever
build any momentum up.

569
00:15:34,551 --> 00:15:36,260
The can't ever build any success up there.

570
00:15:36,261 --> 00:15:39,140
Always just slipping
around that just can't,

571
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,060
it can't get control.

572
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,530
And so then they just quit.

573
00:15:42,531 --> 00:15:43,430
It's too much stress.

574
00:15:43,431 --> 00:15:44,300
It's too much pressure,

575
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:45,430
you know?

576
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:45,611
Yeah,

577
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,090
she does.

578
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:46,923
I mean,

579
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:48,040
we've been here,

580
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,960
I've been here trying,

581
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:49,510
swinging.

582
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:49,920
You know,

583
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,640
AAA has been his swing and trying,

584
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,503
you know,

585
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:52,811
I mean,

586
00:15:52,811 --> 00:15:55,660
it's really weird that I just
never seen just given up.

587
00:15:55,661 --> 00:15:59,250
I always felt like a lot of times I go
to auditions and I see people that would,

588
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:02,770
were at the store with me doing
spots now running the camera.

589
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:07,300
I don't want addition people
that I knew was actors years ago,

590
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,520
running cameras and commercial audition.

591
00:16:09,521 --> 00:16:10,060
Right.

592
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,170
And when I'm walking out though,

593
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:12,004
chase me,

594
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,263
how's it going?

595
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:13,601
Yeah.

596
00:16:13,601 --> 00:16:14,740
I started doing this.

597
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:18,160
I really want to direct commercials and
as I'm getting into my car and I'm like,

598
00:16:18,161 --> 00:16:20,500
they never really knew what they
wanted to do in the first place.

599
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,360
They didn't really want to sink that Ti.

600
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,130
If I came to you one day and said,

601
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,480
uh,

602
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:25,901
you know,

603
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:27,790
I'm going to become a fucking writer,

604
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,960
I'm going to become a director.

605
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:29,741
You like Joe,

606
00:16:29,741 --> 00:16:29,921
wait,

607
00:16:29,921 --> 00:16:30,754
what the fuck?

608
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:31,091
Yeah,

609
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:31,660
no

610
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,441
think I would say that.

611
00:16:32,441 --> 00:16:33,910
You know why Ron Howard?

612
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:34,410
No,

613
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:34,501
no,

614
00:16:34,501 --> 00:16:34,601
no,

615
00:16:34,601 --> 00:16:34,840
no.

616
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,100
You don't understand what
trying to say to you,

617
00:16:36,101 --> 00:16:38,080
but there's a lot of people
that in the middle of the game,

618
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:39,521
they changed.

619
00:16:39,521 --> 00:16:40,690
Ron Howard was an accident.

620
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,670
I've got a couple of years in this.

621
00:16:42,671 --> 00:16:45,490
It's not like you come in here and there's
a lot of people have gotten here and

622
00:16:45,491 --> 00:16:45,671
said,

623
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,031
fuck it.

624
00:16:46,031 --> 00:16:46,540
I'm not going to do,

625
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,010
I know I bumped into standards.

626
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:48,620
Where's wild?

627
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,740
Willy Parsons wears a lot of what?

628
00:16:50,741 --> 00:16:51,461
Judy Turner was.

629
00:16:51,461 --> 00:16:53,110
A lot of these people that,

630
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:53,530
you know,

631
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:54,910
we're working for a long time.

632
00:16:54,911 --> 00:16:57,040
She knew that was huge and he
told him he was still working.

633
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:57,471
By the way,

634
00:16:57,471 --> 00:16:58,930
it shouldn't go does a movie here that,

635
00:16:58,931 --> 00:17:00,190
but I shouldn't have said Judy.

636
00:17:00,191 --> 00:17:03,490
She just came to my mind was this little
just trying to come up at the store a

637
00:17:03,491 --> 00:17:04,091
lot of years.

638
00:17:04,091 --> 00:17:05,110
You know a lot of those guys,

639
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,140
you just don't,

640
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:06,821
in my book,

641
00:17:06,821 --> 00:17:08,830
you just never stopped being a stand up.

642
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:09,341
Yeah.

643
00:17:09,341 --> 00:17:10,174
I don't know.

644
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:11,810
Well,

645
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:11,910
it's

646
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,830
just the pressure of performing is,

647
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,673
is different.

648
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:19,740
I think the pressure perform for you
and I is we that we enjoy it because we

649
00:17:19,741 --> 00:17:23,820
know that we're putting in the work and
we want to go up there and give you a

650
00:17:23,821 --> 00:17:24,331
good show.

651
00:17:24,331 --> 00:17:25,680
We want to go up there
and give you some fun.

652
00:17:25,681 --> 00:17:26,401
It's fun for us.

653
00:17:26,401 --> 00:17:27,001
It's fun for you.

654
00:17:27,001 --> 00:17:27,751
It's fun for us.

655
00:17:27,751 --> 00:17:28,584
We want to do it.

656
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,080
But for some folks they
just become more private.

657
00:17:31,081 --> 00:17:32,580
They don't want to deal
with the criticism.

658
00:17:32,581 --> 00:17:34,710
They don't want to deal with
the critiquing of their work.

659
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,740
They don't want to have the stress
of it and they'd rather get a job.

660
00:17:37,741 --> 00:17:38,580
Like as a writer,

661
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,050
that happens to a lot of guys.

662
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,690
They just decided no one to
stand up performing thing.

663
00:17:42,691 --> 00:17:44,130
It's just too fucking harsh.

664
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:44,911
You know?

665
00:17:44,911 --> 00:17:45,091
It's,

666
00:17:45,091 --> 00:17:46,620
I would rather get a job as a writer.

667
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,281
It's easier,

668
00:17:47,281 --> 00:17:50,310
it's more relaxing and then some
of them come back and forth.

669
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:50,611
You know,

670
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,740
the beauty of is that if
you really think about it,

671
00:17:52,741 --> 00:17:55,320
the part of this job is
the nucleus is the writing.

672
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:55,800
Yeah.

673
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,180
So they're not really stray.

674
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,480
No hint changes.

675
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:00,960
Completely fucking different.

676
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,860
Like I'm a producer now what?

677
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:03,510
Ah,

678
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,343
what the fuck?

679
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,390
She's a weird part.

680
00:18:06,391 --> 00:18:08,130
The director kind of makes sense,

681
00:18:08,131 --> 00:18:08,401
right?

682
00:18:08,401 --> 00:18:09,720
Because that's more of a creative,

683
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:13,020
much more creative thing or an editor
or something along those lines.

684
00:18:13,021 --> 00:18:13,321
But yeah,

685
00:18:13,321 --> 00:18:14,154
producer,

686
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,350
well maybe they don't
like the performing part.

687
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:16,771
Maybe,

688
00:18:16,771 --> 00:18:17,101
you know,

689
00:18:17,101 --> 00:18:18,480
maybe they don't like the artistic part,

690
00:18:18,481 --> 00:18:19,710
but they really love movies.

691
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:20,671
I don't know man.

692
00:18:20,671 --> 00:18:22,170
Everybody's got their own fucking path.

693
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,250
But for me,

694
00:18:23,251 --> 00:18:24,330
I think for you and I,

695
00:18:24,331 --> 00:18:25,570
there was only standup,

696
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,150
we weren't going to be anything else.

697
00:18:27,151 --> 00:18:28,290
We were always going to be standing up.

698
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,180
And we,

699
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,300
we know that too.

700
00:18:30,301 --> 00:18:31,380
When like when we were running into,

701
00:18:31,381 --> 00:18:33,330
someone will know if a guy's a real,

702
00:18:33,331 --> 00:18:34,560
I'll call you about this guy.

703
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,131
I'll say,

704
00:18:35,131 --> 00:18:35,581
hey man,

705
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:36,181
have you seen blah,

706
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:36,331
blah,

707
00:18:36,331 --> 00:18:36,990
blah.

708
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:37,823
He's fucking real.

709
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:38,520
That guy's rail,

710
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,150
that guy's real,

711
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:39,983
very funny guy.

712
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,220
And you know what I mean?

713
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:42,270
It's like there's a few,

714
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:42,720
there's,

715
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,680
there's not that many.

716
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,400
There's like,

717
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,460
this may be a thousand professional
comedians in this country.

718
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,440
If you really stop and think about it,

719
00:18:49,441 --> 00:18:51,210
people that make a
living by telling jokes,

720
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,380
is there even a thousand?

721
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,990
Let's be conservative and
say there's a thousand.

722
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,540
And for those,

723
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,700
how many of them are like national,

724
00:18:59,701 --> 00:19:02,420
like touring headliners is like,

725
00:19:02,421 --> 00:19:05,550
it was like 300 maybe two
5,300 something like that.

726
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,770
It's not that many people like that man.

727
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,050
And it's because not
everybody's supposed to do it.

728
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,250
We don't,

729
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,460
the world doesn't need more
than 300 good standup comedians.

730
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:14,740
Okay.

731
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,380
Them enough is enough.

732
00:19:16,381 --> 00:19:17,710
Crazy assholes talking,

733
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,470
talking shit and a,

734
00:19:19,471 --> 00:19:20,550
and making people laugh.

735
00:19:20,551 --> 00:19:21,384
That's like plenty.

736
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,410
W the,

737
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:22,690
the,

738
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:22,891
the,

739
00:19:22,891 --> 00:19:27,390
the vast majority of people will never
be a professional stand up comedian and

740
00:19:27,391 --> 00:19:28,224
they shouldn't be.

741
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,400
They have something else.

742
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:29,561
They,

743
00:19:29,561 --> 00:19:29,821
they,

744
00:19:29,821 --> 00:19:32,580
this is just a step on the way to them,

745
00:19:32,581 --> 00:19:34,680
just finding themselves in some other way.

746
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:35,651
But for you and I,

747
00:19:35,651 --> 00:19:36,271
it was always,

748
00:19:36,271 --> 00:19:37,440
it was like I,

749
00:19:37,441 --> 00:19:38,100
you know,

750
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,130
I was on news radio and one
time the producer said to me,

751
00:19:41,131 --> 00:19:42,270
why are you doing this?

752
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,030
Why are you still doing standup?

753
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,940
You're an actor now.

754
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:46,290
And I was like,

755
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:46,981
Oh my God,

756
00:19:46,981 --> 00:19:48,090
I'm ready to quit right now.

757
00:19:48,091 --> 00:19:48,361
I was like,

758
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:49,410
are you crazy?

759
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:50,850
Like you don't get it.

760
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,330
You know,

761
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:56,330
you can't possibly understand how
much different it is to be on a set,

762
00:19:56,701 --> 00:19:59,190
repeating brilliant words
and someone else wrote,

763
00:19:59,390 --> 00:19:59,760
you know,

764
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,870
in front of a bunch of,

765
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:01,440
you know,

766
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,440
other folks are doing the same thing and
you're doing it in front of an audience

767
00:20:04,441 --> 00:20:06,420
that has to see the same
scene over and over again.

768
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,580
And then you get to watch it
and people enjoy it and this,

769
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,780
there's satisfaction in that.

770
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,060
But it can't fuck with stand up.

771
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:12,901
My God,

772
00:20:12,901 --> 00:20:14,350
it can't fuck with stand up.

773
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:18,150
Bass quote I've heard the
last six months is by a boy.

774
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:18,984
Vinny Credo.

775
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:19,590
What'd he say?

776
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:22,050
He goes general one at this.

777
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,460
They got a second chance.

778
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,470
They get cut standups.

779
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,940
There ain't no cut motherfucker.

780
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,930
I mean for Vinny kernel to
say that I got goosebumps.

781
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,340
My whole body goes,

782
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:32,460
well,

783
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,530
we were having coffee one day
and he's talking about comedic.

784
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,440
These guys supposed to
be comedic actors get,

785
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:38,910
I'm in a fucking audition room.

786
00:20:38,911 --> 00:20:39,744
They die.

787
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,120
People just laugh as a courtesy.

788
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:43,200
Hey,

789
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,530
who did I fight in 1964
because it looks sad.

790
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,790
He'll forget who the fuck talking about.

791
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,010
You know what

792
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:48,670
I'm saying?

793
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:51,610
And then he went right back
to that beautiful statement.

794
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:52,190
Yeah.

795
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:52,601
And he goes,

796
00:20:52,601 --> 00:20:55,720
all I know is I've been in plenty of
rooms with these comedic actors from

797
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:56,710
television show,

798
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:00,100
and once they hit cut that
fucking in heaven standups,

799
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,030
we don't hear cut.

800
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:01,630
I was like,

801
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:02,381
Damn Vinnie,

802
00:21:02,381 --> 00:21:05,140
colonel droplet like a bad motherfucker.

803
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:05,740
There's a,

804
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,390
there's certainly an art to acting.

805
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,320
No doubt about it.

806
00:21:08,321 --> 00:21:08,710
Definitely.

807
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,700
But it's definitely,

808
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:09,980
there's,

809
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,120
there's also the,

810
00:21:11,121 --> 00:21:11,350
the,

811
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:15,460
the real thing about auditions
is that's not normal.

812
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:15,761
You're,

813
00:21:15,761 --> 00:21:18,880
you're pretending you're
sitting down at a desk,

814
00:21:18,881 --> 00:21:22,170
the guys holding a piece of paper and
you've got to pretend that this is a real,

815
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:23,170
it's a real scene.

816
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,700
You've got to pretend
it's really happening.

817
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,770
I mean you're pretending you're
in a different environment,

818
00:21:26,771 --> 00:21:27,730
you're pretending everything.

819
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,870
If you're in the movie,

820
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:33,040
unless you're doing some crazy fucking
CGI screen where everything behind you is

821
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:33,874
a green screen,

822
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:36,040
you're actually like in Brooklyn,

823
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,630
you're actually in front of the house.

824
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:39,880
You're actually pointing
the fake gun at the guy.

825
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:40,270
I mean,

826
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:45,010
there's a lot of shit going on that
would lead you to be better prepared to

827
00:21:45,011 --> 00:21:49,150
pretend that you're actually in the
scene than being in a conference room and

828
00:21:49,151 --> 00:21:51,310
there's some guy who's
reading like reading,

829
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:55,840
like tell us where you put the money
or you're going to be in big fucking

830
00:21:55,841 --> 00:21:56,380
trouble.

831
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:59,500
Like that's how the guy reads it to you
and he's supposed to go blood money guy.

832
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,970
What am I supposed to be real?

833
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:01,541
Come on.

834
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:02,800
It's like ridiculous.

835
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,430
It's so fake that if for you
to be real in that audition,

836
00:22:06,431 --> 00:22:07,180
you almost have,

837
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:11,110
you almost have to be fucking crazy
for you to be real in that wacky ass

838
00:22:11,111 --> 00:22:12,220
audition room.

839
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:15,460
I mean that's that dude just
not wearing a viking outfit.

840
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,930
How were you pretending
you were on a boat?

841
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,741
You're just doing it.

842
00:22:17,741 --> 00:22:21,340
You're just pretending it's some of the
silliest shit ever wants to be there.

843
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:22,300
They should take like,

844
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:22,780
uh,

845
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,540
auditions that they filmed
that were like super silly.

846
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:26,530
It preposterous,

847
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,640
especially for like B movies where they're
like got their cousins and I know I

848
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:34,930
do to Preuss is on moving and he brought
all his friends in that don't act at

849
00:22:34,931 --> 00:22:36,190
all and they all played parts.

850
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,160
That's how to do that.

851
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,050
All the best movies because they
don't know what the fuck's going on.

852
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,280
They don't know what the fuck's going on.

853
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:45,750
It's the guy that comes in and goes,

854
00:22:45,751 --> 00:22:46,050
made me,

855
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:46,240
me,

856
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,840
me again.

857
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:48,743
Oh my God.

858
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:49,410
You know,

859
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,890
it's like I trained at Juilliard.

860
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:52,643
What's his name?

861
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:54,780
What's the guy trained
doctor for the last month.

862
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:57,630
Boogie nights has been on
HBO every fucking nights.

863
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:58,501
Every night.

864
00:22:58,501 --> 00:22:59,590
And you got to watch the movie.

865
00:22:59,591 --> 00:23:00,424
It's a great movie.

866
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:01,550
But who's the guy in that?

867
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:05,520
The crazy guy tries to make out with
market Walberg he's in a bunch of movies

868
00:23:05,521 --> 00:23:05,760
now.

869
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,593
Uh,

870
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,720
see Riley's not the guy from
stepbrothers name with the blonde hair.

871
00:23:12,961 --> 00:23:14,400
He's kind of Chubby and shit.

872
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,680
He's got a bunch of those.

873
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,040
Nelson Riley.

874
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:18,121
Well you can't,

875
00:23:18,121 --> 00:23:20,130
you can't have a salt like Denzel and him.

876
00:23:20,131 --> 00:23:22,050
You can't have a cell phone on set.

877
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,280
Can have a cell phone and said,

878
00:23:24,281 --> 00:23:25,660
well that's smart man cell.

879

Here's a test cell phone.

880
00:23:27,101 --> 00:23:28,000
Paul Thomas Anderson.

881
00:23:28,001 --> 00:23:28,181
No,

882
00:23:28,181 --> 00:23:29,014
that's director.

883
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,100
If there's 10 zero,

884
00:23:30,101 --> 00:23:30,970
he is a cell phone.

885
00:23:30,971 --> 00:23:33,630
He abandoned ship really cannot focus on,

886
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:34,510
well you know,

887
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,880
in like when everybody got mad at 'em,

888
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:37,600
uh,

889
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,433
Batman.

890
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,260
Remember when he screamed at some
guy for walking in front of a shot?

891
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,120
John C.

892
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,070
Reilly Jonsi right now that's the,

893
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,093
that's the crazy

894
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:47,263
dummy.

895
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,200
William H Macy.

896
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:48,531
No,

897
00:23:48,531 --> 00:23:49,880
that's the guy that shot himself.

898
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:51,403
Nina Hartley.

899
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:54,030
Where's boy?

900
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,760
He played a camera guy.

901
00:23:55,761 --> 00:23:56,594
Boom.

902
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:57,591
But he's always,

903
00:23:57,591 --> 00:24:01,430
he tries to make out with him in
1980 and she buys the corvette.

904
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,520
You sure he's in Boogie nights.

905
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:05,810
Yeah.

906
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:06,620
How's this possible?

907
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,190
Oh,

908
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,360
Phillip Seymour Hoffman.

909
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,410
Jesus Christ.

910
00:24:09,411 --> 00:24:10,244
Like that guy.

911
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,420
Remember that guy's name?

912
00:24:11,421 --> 00:24:12,380
I love that guy.

913
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:13,830
I'm going to throw your mover.

914
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,290
He's really good dog.

915
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,620
He plays himself.

916
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:16,691
I,

917
00:24:16,691 --> 00:24:19,610
it's like a dick in that
movie with Jennifer Aniston.

918
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:20,511
And,

919
00:24:20,511 --> 00:24:20,700
uh,

920
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:20,941
he,

921
00:24:20,941 --> 00:24:23,950
he plays the kid's friend like a washed
up back to their lives in New York and

922
00:24:23,951 --> 00:24:26,570
he's the leaving and
Jesus Christ superstar.

923
00:24:26,571 --> 00:24:27,350
But he really,

924
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:27,670
I mean,

925
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:27,980
yeah.

926
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,813
Yeah.

927
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:33,350
Have you seen that Jennifer Aniston may
time frame and should I watch it one

928
00:24:33,351 --> 00:24:33,650
time?

929
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:34,161
Terrible.

930
00:24:34,161 --> 00:24:37,200
But he's never bad in anything grazing.

931
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,350
He's good and fucking boogie nights.

932
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,840
But last week they were
saying that there was a,

933
00:24:41,841 --> 00:24:43,220
an award show and I'm like,

934
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,093
uh,

935
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:48,230
and Venice and he showed up with a stained
shirt who's had was fucked up and he

936
00:24:48,231 --> 00:24:49,190
had been on the couch.

937
00:24:49,191 --> 00:24:54,020
And it's amazing how those guys act
because they don't want to act like,

938
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:54,700
let me,

939
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,090
let me tell you that I don't care,

940
00:24:56,091 --> 00:24:56,924
but I really care.

941
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,180
He was in the big Lebowski to fuck.

942
00:24:59,181 --> 00:24:59,571
Yeah Bro.

943
00:24:59,571 --> 00:25:02,300
That dude's spending a bunch
of things really good shit.

944
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:02,961
He's the real deal.

945
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:03,794
This new movie,

946
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,810
they say he's really good as new movie.

947
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,700
It's good and that's going
to win an award this year.

948
00:25:07,701 --> 00:25:08,151
They stay.

949
00:25:08,151 --> 00:25:09,620
Thank God the master or something.

950
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:12,160
It looks like his other movie too though,

951
00:25:12,161 --> 00:25:12,551
doesn't it?

952
00:25:12,551 --> 00:25:14,070
Where he played like the president or

953
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:16,680
he convinces somebody or something crazy.

954
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,750
Played like the president.

955
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,613
Who did he play?

956
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,580
What movie was that?

957
00:25:20,581 --> 00:25:21,330
He played,

958
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:21,601
he,

959
00:25:21,601 --> 00:25:22,800
it came out recently.

960
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,000
It wasn't the president.

961
00:25:24,001 --> 00:25:25,890
It was somebody famous that he played.

962
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:27,843
Uh,

963
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:28,661
but he's a new movie.

964
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:29,590
It looks like that movie.

965
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:30,660
Well,

966
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,050
he was in the ides of March.

967
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:32,851
That was the,

968
00:25:32,851 --> 00:25:33,020
uh,

969
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,630
the most famous,

970
00:25:34,631 --> 00:25:35,021
I think,

971
00:25:35,021 --> 00:25:36,010
recent movie.

972
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:37,451
You sure are.

973
00:25:37,451 --> 00:25:39,940
You sure you're confusing
him with somebody else?

974
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,153
What's his name again?

975
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,300
Phillip Seymour Hoffman.

976
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,200
How dare you.

977
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,100
Jesus Christ.

978
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:47,400
He was in money ball.

979
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,030
I just got movies.

980
00:25:49,031 --> 00:25:49,460
Good.

981
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,280
Moneyball.

982
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,130
He's going to be in right.

983
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:51,911
He's really good.

984
00:25:51,911 --> 00:25:52,360
What's that?

985
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,350
What's his newest movie?

986
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:54,071
Uh,

987
00:25:54,071 --> 00:25:56,560
the newest one is a late quartet.

988
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:56,831
No,

989
00:25:56,831 --> 00:25:57,300
under that.

990
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:57,940
The master,

991
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,860
the master is the one they say is bad ass.

992
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:00,191
Really?

993
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:00,911
It's kind of weird,

994
00:26:00,911 --> 00:26:01,990
but he's really good.

995
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,011
It's like a,

996
00:26:03,011 --> 00:26:05,200
he convinces somebody to join Scientology.

997
00:26:05,201 --> 00:26:05,860
I don't fucking,

998
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:06,693
he's a beast.

999
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,301
He's a,

1000
00:26:07,301 --> 00:26:08,170
he's a great actor.

1001
00:26:08,171 --> 00:26:09,430
He's a [inaudible].

1002
00:26:09,431 --> 00:26:12,290
He played a Truman Capote's is,

1003
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:15,340
those motherfuckers really do
go on doing their own sense,

1004
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:15,581
you know,

1005
00:26:15,581 --> 00:26:16,390
that's their strength.

1006
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:16,531
They,

1007
00:26:16,531 --> 00:26:16,721
they,

1008
00:26:16,721 --> 00:26:16,961
you know,

1009
00:26:16,961 --> 00:26:19,600
they take it to the next
limit like that to watch it.

1010
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:22,840
The only guy seen in a room that
fucks it up in a room like that.

1011
00:26:22,841 --> 00:26:24,780
I seen two motherfuckers fucking diploma.

1012
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:25,720
I'm going to table.

1013
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,440
They are who?

1014
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,400
Christopher Walken.

1015
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:32,380
But one of the baddest motherfuckers
that was on his tail was Phil apartment.

1016
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,401
Oh yeah,

1017
00:26:33,401 --> 00:26:34,370
he can audition.

1018
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,620
He was a such a professional bill Hartman
and could light up a room by himself

1019
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:38,860
though.

1020
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:39,760
That's a real gift.

1021
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:40,870
Not too many.

1022
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:45,120
When people clap on the scene when do a
movie scene and at the end when they go

1023
00:26:45,121 --> 00:26:46,620
cut and the motherfuckers are like,

1024
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:48,330
yeah,

1025
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:50,820
like what the fuck did we just see?

1026
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,790
You know when they were saying when the,

1027
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:53,760
when they did a,

1028
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,790
I went one day on the Adam Sandler
when Christopher Walken was there,

1029
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,310
but there was saying when I got there
the days early that when that mother

1030
00:27:00,311 --> 00:27:01,410
fucker does this scene,

1031
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:03,120
he locks you in on the set.

1032
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,860
Like I'm the set that people are like,

1033
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:07,560
like you have to look
at the person to cut,

1034
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:08,580
cut,

1035
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,001
cut.

1036
00:27:09,001 --> 00:27:09,390
And they're like,

1037
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:10,223
oh fuck.

1038
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:13,340
That's how much he locks you
in like he used and probe.

1039
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,020
When you watch that movie
where he shoots himself,

1040
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:18,150
you know deedee mile and be a hunter.

1041
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,010
I was watching that about two months ago.

1042
00:27:20,011 --> 00:27:20,850
He was brilliant.

1043
00:27:20,851 --> 00:27:21,684
He locked me out.

1044
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,010
Oh,

1045
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:23,250
he's playing the fucking guy.

1046
00:27:23,251 --> 00:27:24,870
That's all he was.

1047
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,370
He was on heroin,

1048
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,560
whatever they were giving him and
Vietnam and he was on a game of his,

1049
00:27:31,561 --> 00:27:33,840
he made money by playing Russian roulette.

1050
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:34,350
She's,

1051
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,060
how do you prepare for that character?

1052
00:27:36,061 --> 00:27:36,871
Do you want to tell me?

1053
00:27:36,871 --> 00:27:41,871
Do you want to what I think teacher on
Melrose did tell you about that shit.

1054
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,430
You think about that
motherfucker and that you know,

1055
00:27:44,431 --> 00:27:46,440
he had to come up with that
character from somewhere.

1056
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,460
So there was motherfuckers
walking around that said,

1057
00:27:48,461 --> 00:27:49,110
you know what?

1058
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,250
Fuck my family.

1059
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:53,370
I've already killed 50
fucking donkey Kong's Vietnam.

1060
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:54,181
I killed everybody.

1061
00:27:54,181 --> 00:27:54,700
Russians,

1062
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,533
French.

1063
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,010
I'm just like,

1064
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,420
practice killing myself now.

1065
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:58,890
They put that band on,

1066
00:27:58,891 --> 00:28:01,950
they do a little bit number two and that
shit was pure over there that it's like

1067
00:28:01,951 --> 00:28:02,371
bouncing.

1068
00:28:02,371 --> 00:28:03,204
Did you see him in that?

1069
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:03,841
Remember that?

1070
00:28:03,841 --> 00:28:04,351
What's his name,

1071
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:06,510
came to get him and he
couldn't get queued them.

1072
00:28:06,511 --> 00:28:07,650
They were childhood friends.

1073
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,360
He couldn't get through to him,

1074
00:28:09,361 --> 00:28:09,720
Bro.

1075
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,610
Imagine how deep you are playing that.

1076
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,340
That's a scary thinking
that you're going to,

1077
00:28:14,341 --> 00:28:15,120
what are you doing today?

1078
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,020
I'm going to go shoot pool.

1079
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:18,390
I'm going to go over to him to play
Russian roulette for a few hours.

1080
00:28:18,391 --> 00:28:18,631
I said,

1081
00:28:18,631 --> 00:28:18,841
Yo,

1082
00:28:18,841 --> 00:28:19,674
what the fuck is,

1083
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:23,010
how crazy are the Russians
if they came up with that?

1084
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,740
Is that who invented a gas?

1085
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:25,980
It's called Russian roulette.

1086
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:27,360
Brian know anything about it?

1087
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,313
I have no idea.

1088
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:28,741
I mean,

1089
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:29,480
is that what it's it?

1090
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:29,850
That's,

1091
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:30,960
that's must be there.

1092
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,340
The invention of Russian roulette,

1093
00:28:32,341 --> 00:28:33,174
right.

1094
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:37,030
Christopher Walken made a movie
that's not a popular movie.

1095
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:37,470
I mean,

1096
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:39,450
one of his best movies
was the one that he takes.

1097
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:42,600
The acid will move with Natalie Wood.

1098
00:28:42,601 --> 00:28:45,270
Isn't there a movie where he
does something altered states?

1099
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:46,840
Who's in that office?

1100
00:28:46,841 --> 00:28:48,110
Dates was um,

1101
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:48,983
John hurt.

1102
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:49,381
Yeah.

1103
00:28:49,381 --> 00:28:49,990
William hurt.

1104
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:50,823
Julian hurt.

1105
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:51,810
William hurt.

1106
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:52,051
Yeah.

1107
00:28:52,051 --> 00:28:54,240
William hurt played the scientists for me.

1108
00:28:54,241 --> 00:28:57,480
One of the best times I ever seen
Christopher Walker is a movie called that

1109
00:28:57,481 --> 00:28:58,900
close range with Sean Penn.

1110
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,410
He played the dad like dad.

1111
00:29:01,411 --> 00:29:04,160
He's very good in that very fucking good.

1112
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,551
And the movie,

1113
00:29:05,551 --> 00:29:07,770
like the week before they
pulled the budget or something.

1114
00:29:07,771 --> 00:29:08,640
So the movie never,

1115
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,170
Mcdonald's got the soundtrack.

1116
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:10,501
Yeah.

1117
00:29:10,501 --> 00:29:10,960
Yeah.

1118
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,730
I ran away and was a good movie.

1119
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:12,941
Yes.

1120
00:29:12,941 --> 00:29:13,800
That's a very good move.

1121
00:29:13,801 --> 00:29:14,634
If you haven't watched that,

1122
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,560
people have been hitting me
up for a good movie lately.

1123
00:29:16,561 --> 00:29:17,790
Watch at close range.

1124
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,330
1985 that was Donna.

1125
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,930
You know who don't have
lines in that movie.

1126
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,141
You know,

1127
00:29:22,141 --> 00:29:23,140
it was going to have a movie like that.

1128
00:29:23,141 --> 00:29:23,910
Don't have wines.

1129
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,380
Who was a star at 24.

1130
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:27,880
He ain't got a fever.

1131
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:28,680
Heat.

1132
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,400
The Sutherland and Crispin
Grover Glover is in that movie.

1133
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:32,950
Uh,

1134
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:34,110
Sean Penn's brother.

1135
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:34,710
I mean,

1136
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:35,700
they're fucking phenomenal.

1137
00:29:35,701 --> 00:29:36,090
Yeah.

1138
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:38,490
This is a for not I get fucking movie,

1139
00:29:38,491 --> 00:29:38,761
man.

1140
00:29:38,761 --> 00:29:41,710
I get goosebumps thinking
about when he tells Sean Penn,

1141
00:29:41,711 --> 00:29:42,491
Sean Penn thousand,

1142
00:29:42,491 --> 00:29:42,720
I'm,

1143
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,170
I'm not going to rob with you know more.

1144
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:44,801
And he's like,

1145
00:29:44,801 --> 00:29:45,634
what are you going to do?

1146
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,571
You got a girl,

1147
00:29:46,571 --> 00:29:47,404
you got rent,

1148
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:48,490
you've got a job,

1149
00:29:48,491 --> 00:29:49,120
when are you going to do,

1150
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,350
what are you going to
do when you get there?

1151
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,550
Fuck you.

1152
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,510
And they start getting it out.

1153
00:29:52,511 --> 00:29:56,560
He buys a quarter ounce of weed from him
and he shoots the girl and then at the

1154
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:56,771
end,

1155
00:29:56,771 --> 00:30:00,280
and Sean Penn comes to his house with
at nine millimeter and then he and he

1156
00:30:00,281 --> 00:30:00,461

1158
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:02,120
don't even,

1159
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,810
spoiler spoiler.

1160
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,050
Oh my God,

1161
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,310
I'm getting goosebumps.

1162
00:30:06,311 --> 00:30:07,720
Just thinking I forgot all about that.

1163
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:09,130
And here's the,

1164
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:09,963
here's the clinker.

1165
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:11,200
I'm like Caroline's,

1166
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,960
I'm doing the motherfucking
Toyota comedy festival.

1167
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:15,010
They put me up,

1168
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,180
you know,

1169
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,670
1255 the show was,

1170
00:30:18,671 --> 00:30:18,901
you know,

1171
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:19,631
there's nine people,

1172
00:30:19,631 --> 00:30:20,680
but I made the festival,

1173
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:23,890
but guess who stayed the
assistant from the Sopranos,

1174
00:30:23,891 --> 00:30:24,724
right?

1175
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:25,970
So she comes up to me,

1176
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,740
she goes,

1177
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,770
are you busy tomorrow?

1178
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:30,550
This is when the Sopranos for a start.

1179
00:30:30,551 --> 00:30:32,140
I go in and know and she goes,

1180
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,420
would you mind coming to
my office at 11 o'clock?

1181
00:30:34,421 --> 00:30:35,530
Somebody wants to meet you.

1182
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,030
This is a true story.

1183
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:37,211
I go,

1184
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:37,630
what?

1185
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:38,141
And she goes,

1186
00:30:38,141 --> 00:30:39,070
she wrote the paper,

1187
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:39,641
she goes,

1188
00:30:39,641 --> 00:30:40,211
here's what you're going to go.

1189
00:30:40,211 --> 00:30:44,200
11 o'clock I was headed to
buffalo for $450 as a feature.

1190
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,520
Okay?

1191
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,061
And she goes,

1192
00:30:46,061 --> 00:30:46,250
no,

1193
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:46,350
no,

1194
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:46,431
no,

1195
00:30:46,431 --> 00:30:46,521
no,

1196
00:30:46,521 --> 00:30:46,591
no,

1197
00:30:46,591 --> 00:30:46,721
no.

1198
00:30:46,721 --> 00:30:48,130
You got to come to my office tomorrow.

1199
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,260
So I go to this place,

1200
00:30:50,261 --> 00:30:51,270
it's on 48th street,

1201
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,990
up the block from Roger Paul's Office,

1202
00:30:52,991 --> 00:30:55,960
and I'm sitting out front
and a blind Chubby lady.

1203
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,441
Cute,

1204
00:30:56,441 --> 00:31:00,370
real like you could tell she was hot and
here you get tired of a cab and sees me

1205
00:31:00,371 --> 00:31:00,591
and go,

1206
00:31:00,591 --> 00:31:01,151
excuse me,

1207
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:01,984
you were an actor.

1208
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:02,861
And I go,

1209
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:03,071
no,

1210
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:03,761
I'm going to stand up.

1211
00:31:03,761 --> 00:31:04,650
And she was doing me a favor.

1212
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,670
Go Up to my office and
leave your name and number.

1213
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,321
And I go,

1214
00:31:08,321 --> 00:31:08,801
what office?

1215
00:31:08,801 --> 00:31:09,131
She goes,

1216
00:31:09,131 --> 00:31:09,641
whatever.

1217
00:31:09,641 --> 00:31:10,474
Walking.

1218
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:10,961
And I go,

1219
00:31:10,961 --> 00:31:11,860
my 11 o'clock,

1220
00:31:11,861 --> 00:31:12,760
I'm year 11 o'clock.

1221
00:31:12,761 --> 00:31:13,061
And she goes,

1222
00:31:13,061 --> 00:31:13,894
oh my God.

1223
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,450
My assistant called me last night,

1224
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:15,671
come,

1225
00:31:15,671 --> 00:31:15,941
come,

1226
00:31:15,941 --> 00:31:16,774
forget the coffee.

1227
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,010
And I'm in the elevator.

1228
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:18,821
I go,

1229
00:31:18,821 --> 00:31:20,050
can I ask you a personal question?

1230
00:31:20,051 --> 00:31:20,411
They really,

1231
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:21,790
Christopher Walken's
while he was just like,

1232
00:31:21,791 --> 00:31:22,624
fuck yeah.

1233
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,670
And I go,

1234
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:25,900
I fucking love that dude.

1235
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,180
And I go his best movies at close range.

1236
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:29,230
A lot of people would say,

1237
00:31:29,231 --> 00:31:29,820
deer hunter.

1238
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,120
This bitch looked at me and she goes,

1239
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,700
you just got three quarters in my door.

1240
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:35,080
That is his best movie.

1241
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:37,040
We have an argument at the
house every day about it.

1242
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,110
So what was this about
there you got dragged into,

1243
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:41,710
they drank.

1244
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:41,871
No,

1245
00:31:41,871 --> 00:31:42,250
no,

1246
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,380
I'm talking about the street when her,

1247
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:44,450
it wasn't the Sopranos.

1248
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:45,670
David call me in front of audition,

1249
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:50,350
but this woman who brought you arrested
for walking his wife and she was working

1250
00:31:50,351 --> 00:31:51,880
for the soprano's cast it,

1251
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,440
her and her partner,

1252
00:31:53,441 --> 00:31:54,280
cashless or primal.

1253
00:31:54,281 --> 00:31:55,450
She's the one that night anymore.

1254
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:56,380
Now she's retired.

1255
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:57,130
She retired.

1256
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:58,060
I put some problems,

1257
00:31:58,061 --> 00:32:01,810
but before that it was Christopher
Walken's wife that puts you in that show.

1258
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,710
That's where you met with,

1259
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:03,311
wow,

1260
00:32:03,311 --> 00:32:03,940
that's crazy.

1261
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:04,773
That's crazy.

1262
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:05,890
Yeah,

1263
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:06,723
it makes sense though.

1264
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,510
Successful relationship
with a lot of those people.

1265
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:11,710
It's all in the business.

1266
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,200
People understand how
nutty that business is,

1267
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,070
you know?

1268
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:15,390
You know,

1269
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:18,310
I was thinking about it and when they
started accusing him of throwing that

1270
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,870
Natalie Wood off the boat shed,

1271
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:20,980
Christopher Walken,

1272
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,880
wasn't he on the boat?

1273
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,080
He,

1274
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:22,501
no,

1275
00:32:22,501 --> 00:32:22,780
no.

1276
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,391
He was on the boat.

1277
00:32:23,391 --> 00:32:23,831
It was,

1278
00:32:23,831 --> 00:32:24,810
but that's not who they know.

1279
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,001
No,

1280
00:32:25,001 --> 00:32:25,481
it was a,

1281
00:32:25,481 --> 00:32:26,111
it was a,

1282
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:26,541
you know,

1283
00:32:26,541 --> 00:32:26,950
uh,

1284
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:27,820
it takes a fif.

1285
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:28,421
Yeah.

1286
00:32:28,421 --> 00:32:29,254
What is his name?

1287
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:29,800
Robert.

1288
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,580
Robert Raglin.

1289
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,241
It takes a thief.

1290
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:32,140
I just took it deep.

1291
00:32:32,141 --> 00:32:34,000
What was the show he had
after that with the red head?

1292
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,100
With the hot redhead?

1293
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:36,641
Jesus.

1294
00:32:36,641 --> 00:32:37,510
Carol Christ.

1295
00:32:37,511 --> 00:32:38,080
You're killing me.

1296
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:38,950
I kill your dog.

1297
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,980
I'd take it deep.

1298
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:40,911
Brian,

1299
00:32:40,911 --> 00:32:42,020
you weren't even around for it.

1300
00:32:42,021 --> 00:32:42,621
Takes a thief.

1301
00:32:42,621 --> 00:32:43,910
Your head with a fucking exploded.

1302
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,530
How do you say his name again?

1303
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,490
Robert Wagner.

1304
00:32:46,491 --> 00:32:51,491
W.

1305
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,160
A.

1306
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,160
G.

1307
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,160
N.

1308
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,160
E.

1309
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,160
R.

1310
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,640
Redhead.

1311
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,000
Oh,

1312
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,380
a Stephanie from mother fucking powers.

1313
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,320
She was the first original cougar.

1314
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,171
Yeah.

1315
00:33:00,171 --> 00:33:01,100
They think that he killed.

1316
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:01,340
No,

1317
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,173
ma'am.

1318
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:05,760
There's a guy who apparently
is putting out a book.

1319
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:06,320
Right?

1320
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:06,720
I think,

1321
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,441
think that he,

1322
00:33:07,441 --> 00:33:07,650
uh,

1323
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:09,450
killed Natalie Wood.

1324
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:09,720
Yeah.

1325
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,430
His memory came back after 20 years.

1326
00:33:11,431 --> 00:33:12,390
Once he got the book deal.

1327
00:33:12,391 --> 00:33:13,224
Once again,

1328
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,730
once they get in the 50,000,

1329
00:33:14,731 --> 00:33:15,560
he fucking remembered.

1330
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,010
He snapped out of his alcoholism.

1331
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,390
He's been on a couple.

1332
00:33:18,391 --> 00:33:19,224
Uh,

1333
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:20,610
and CIS is

1334
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,653
yeah,

1335
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,341
and a few,

1336
00:33:25,341 --> 00:33:26,540
two and a half men's.

1337
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,950
I wonder what the fuck,

1338
00:33:29,951 --> 00:33:30,784
man.

1339
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,693
Wow.

1340
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,420
That's a crazy thing that to,

1341
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:37,751
I mean,

1342
00:33:37,751 --> 00:33:39,280
if this guy bullshit it,

1343
00:33:39,281 --> 00:33:44,260
could you imagine if your wife died in
a tragic accident and then years later

1344
00:33:44,261 --> 00:33:48,580
some motherfucker is writing
a book claiming that you
killed her and you have to

1345
00:33:48,581 --> 00:33:53,380
deal with the fact that you lost her
anyway and you loved her and you miss her.

1346
00:33:53,381 --> 00:33:55,780
And this guy who you know,

1347
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,350
who knows why the fuck
he's is that you breathing?

1348
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:00,843
No

1349
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,550
sitting here holding my breath.

1350
00:34:03,551 --> 00:34:04,384
Cock sucker.

1351
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:05,950
No.

1352
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:06,790
What was her name again?

1353
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,353
He would,

1354
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,880
if he didn't kill her,

1355
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,170
if he really didn't kill her,

1356
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,101
then this guy,

1357
00:34:12,101 --> 00:34:13,840
what a piece of shit this guy is.

1358
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:15,340
That would be a horrible thing.

1359
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:17,440
And it's based on when
they got back from fishing,

1360
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:18,370
something like that.

1361
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,270
And if he did kill her,

1362
00:34:19,271 --> 00:34:19,391
well,

1363
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:21,010
he's a piece of shit
and this guy's a hero.

1364
00:34:21,011 --> 00:34:21,810
Right?

1365
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,020
Keeping chasing after it.

1366
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,153
Wow.

1367
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,360
This is really interesting.

1368
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,590
The only full sentence I could completely
deciphered during the entire argument

1369
00:34:31,591 --> 00:34:34,770
was get off my fucking
boat set by Robert Wagner.

1370
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:36,680
Wow.

1371
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,590
The day after woods body was
found off the coast of California.

1372
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,790
This Guy Davern said that he
was asked to go to Wagner,

1373
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:44,521
his bedroom,

1374
00:34:44,521 --> 00:34:49,521
and his Beverly hills home where he
met with a lawyer and was told to say

1375
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:50,483
nothing.

1376
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:52,990
The captain wrote,

1377
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:56,860
Wagner informed me he would
hire an attorney who had
handled my statement about

1378
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:58,870
Natalie Wood's disappearance and drowning,

1379
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,480
which he did before
Natalie Wood's funeral,

1380
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:05,920
I signed a statement appointed district
attorney drafted one completely void of

1381
00:35:05,921 --> 00:35:08,860
facts of the facts surrounding
Natalie was disappearance.

1382
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:09,940
Wow.

1383
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:11,500
That's crazy,

1384
00:35:11,501 --> 00:35:12,334
man.

1385
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,430
They might've got shrunk and he threw
her off the fucking boat and she just

1386
00:35:15,431 --> 00:35:15,971
drown.

1387
00:35:15,971 --> 00:35:16,860
What you was that brother?

1388
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:23,780
1981 November 28th,

1389
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,130
1981 wow.

1390
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,320
They got an a drunk fighting.

1391
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:27,530
He threw her off the boat.

1392
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,090
Holy Shit.

1393
00:35:30,091 --> 00:35:31,260
If this guy is telling the truth,

1394
00:35:31,261 --> 00:35:35,790
that's horrific because that guy's
got to live with that and got,

1395
00:35:35,791 --> 00:35:36,121
damn.

1396
00:35:36,121 --> 00:35:37,050
Natalie Wood was hot.

1397
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:37,770
Oh my God.

1398
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:38,603
Ooh.

1399
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,740
She was no makeup,

1400
00:35:40,741 --> 00:35:41,381
no Claire.

1401
00:35:41,381 --> 00:35:45,510
All that was 1981 though that bitch
waked up track a glass of orange juice.

1402
00:35:45,511 --> 00:35:46,470
And that's what she looked like.

1403
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:48,211
Yeah.

1404
00:35:48,211 --> 00:35:49,410
This is really crazy,

1405
00:35:49,411 --> 00:35:50,244
man.

1406
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:55,380
The detectives at the WHO is at the
heart of the original case said that he

1407
00:35:55,381 --> 00:35:56,760
believed Wagner's account.

1408
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:01,290
He added that the actress was very
small so that it was believable that she

1409
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:03,930
drowned quickly while yeah,

1410
00:36:03,931 --> 00:36:06,210
Christopher Walken was on the boat.

1411
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,343
Yeah.

1412
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:10,003
Wow.

1413
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:15,360
It says Christopher Walken began talking
about his total pursuit of a career

1414
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:19,290
which he admitted was more important
to him than his personal life.

1415
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:22,680
He clearly thought Natalie
should live like that too.

1416
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:24,583
Wow.

1417
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:25,911
So,

1418
00:36:25,911 --> 00:36:26,300
uh,

1419
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,880
they got in an argument that was
what started off the argument.

1420
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:34,070
It sounds like Christopher Walken was
trying to get some pussy and Robert Wagner

1421
00:36:34,071 --> 00:36:37,310
was there and they were all drunk and
they were all getting shitty with each

1422
00:36:37,311 --> 00:36:41,480
other and he fucking threw off the
boat and he tried to be captain,

1423
00:36:41,481 --> 00:36:42,314
save a hoe.

1424
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,790
And Robert Wagner said,

1425
00:36:43,791 --> 00:36:45,590
what bitch you ain't going home with?

1426
00:36:45,591 --> 00:36:48,320
Nobody grabbed it by the fucking
head doing true in that ocean.

1427
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:51,260
Well that's so scary,

1428
00:36:51,261 --> 00:36:52,094
man.

1429
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,180
Which could have happened.

1430
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,070
We weren't there and who the fuck knows?

1431
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:56,953
Oh Man.

1432
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:58,470
They had that kids too.

1433
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,430
That kids.

1434
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:00,090
Yeah,

1435
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:01,020
they had two children.

1436
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:03,330
Oh God.

1437
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,793
What a mess.

1438
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:05,880
Dude.

1439
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,940
Is there anything worse than relationships
gone wrong where you're screaming and

1440
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,620
yelling at each other while drunk?

1441
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:13,740
That is like one of the
lowest forms of mankind.

1442
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,790
A relationship gone wrong where you're
both drunk and you're yelling at him.

1443
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:25,500
It's just Charles boot
Koski ask and it's sadness.

1444
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:26,910
Whatever the woman you date,

1445
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:27,930
you got to do the opposite.

1446
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:30,360
If she has a cocktail once in a while,

1447
00:37:30,361 --> 00:37:31,194
you smoke riva,

1448
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,490
she smokes reef.

1449
00:37:33,491 --> 00:37:34,324
You have one.

1450
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:34,711
Yeah.

1451
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:36,660
Cause when you both do
something that's the same,

1452
00:37:36,661 --> 00:37:37,620
it's not going to pay it off.

1453
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:39,900
It seems to be that it
works in some paypal.

1454
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:42,150
You know some people that
professional pool players,

1455
00:37:42,151 --> 00:37:42,984
they're both,

1456
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,670
they're both men and female.

1457
00:37:44,671 --> 00:37:46,290
Both professional pool
players and it works.

1458
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,450
Some people do that with
golfing and it works.

1459
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,380
Some people do that.

1460
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:50,880
It works with some comedians.

1461
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,660
Tom and Christina,

1462
00:37:52,661 --> 00:37:53,880
the perfect example,

1463
00:37:53,881 --> 00:37:54,714
it works great.

1464
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:55,613
Fucking works.

1465
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,970
Those people are happy as fuck.

1466
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:59,750
Thomas common his wife
for super happy and say,

1467
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:00,301
well it doesn't,

1468
00:38:00,301 --> 00:38:00,601
you know,

1469
00:38:00,601 --> 00:38:02,910
so it's not always,

1470
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,340
but it's a low percentage is low.

1471
00:38:05,341 --> 00:38:09,150
What I'm trying to say is every time I've
dated a woman when I was younger that

1472
00:38:09,151 --> 00:38:09,271
she,

1473
00:38:09,271 --> 00:38:11,150
let's say she did blow and I did blow.

1474
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,360
At first it was great because
she sucking your Dick,

1475
00:38:13,361 --> 00:38:18,361
your light and her ass one five but 10
somewhere along the line it gets a stray

1476
00:38:18,871 --> 00:38:20,850
when she's watching
you because you got it,

1477
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:21,830
you don't want to share it with,

1478
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:22,980
oh Geez.

1479
00:38:22,981 --> 00:38:23,814
I'm saying you don't want,

1480
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:24,870
you got your period bitch,

1481
00:38:24,871 --> 00:38:25,061
you,

1482
00:38:25,061 --> 00:38:25,980
you no good to me.

1483
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:26,820
You know,

1484
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,290
so you're doing blow by yourself.

1485
00:38:28,291 --> 00:38:28,441
No.

1486
00:38:28,441 --> 00:38:28,921
So she's like,

1487
00:38:28,921 --> 00:38:29,820
are you doing blow?

1488
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:30,750
No.

1489
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:31,680
And your jaw is going now.

1490
00:38:31,681 --> 00:38:35,440
She wants to do a line now she wants
you to fuck and she's got that blood and

1491
00:38:35,441 --> 00:38:36,010
you got your on the

1492
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:36,371
blow.

1493
00:38:36,371 --> 00:38:37,204
Fuck that.

1494
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:38,230
When the chick had a period,

1495
00:38:38,231 --> 00:38:39,040
I don't show up.

1496
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:39,490
Really lucky.

1497
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:39,790
Yeah.

1498
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:40,391
Fuck you.

1499
00:38:40,391 --> 00:38:41,260
Just in case she even,

1500
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:41,711
it's that,

1501
00:38:41,711 --> 00:38:43,420
that I made that mistake one time.

1502
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:47,110
Whenever it chicks out with a period that
she started getting naked and she had

1503
00:38:47,111 --> 00:38:47,720
like a,

1504
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:47,950
you know,

1505
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:51,700
she had the fuse right in the front
and I have to like five or six hours.

1506
00:38:51,701 --> 00:38:53,560
They can only suck your
Dick so many times I'm like,

1507
00:38:53,561 --> 00:38:54,490
maybe I'll eat her ass.

1508
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,820
And I went to either as,

1509
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,020
yeah,

1510
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:56,930
like a half a ever.

1511
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,110
If that shit,

1512
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:00,070
the next day mark Babbitt picked me up.

1513
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,340
Half of the kids that
picked me up to that.

1514
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,510
Where is he these days?

1515
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:05,740
I Dunno,

1516
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,190
I dunno.

1517
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:09,180
I think he's the vice president
of Sandusky cooperation and shit.

1518
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:14,760
Who is the head of the laugh stop
in Houston during the glory days,

1519
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,950
the glory days where you would go there.

1520
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,510
People don't know about Houston,

1521
00:39:18,511 --> 00:39:18,961
Texas,

1522
00:39:18,961 --> 00:39:19,321
man.

1523
00:39:19,321 --> 00:39:20,790
People do not know about Houston,

1524
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:21,211
Texas.

1525
00:39:21,211 --> 00:39:22,170
What it used to be,

1526
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:22,771
first of all,

1527
00:39:22,771 --> 00:39:23,261
it's the first,

1528
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:26,250
first place in the country
that I could sell out shows.

1529
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:27,660
The very first place was Houston,

1530
00:39:27,661 --> 00:39:30,960
Texas and when the laugh
stop was in his prime glory,

1531
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:36,230
they had a Monday night open mic night
where they would go from fucking whatever

1532
00:39:36,421 --> 00:39:37,051
they started.

1533
00:39:37,051 --> 00:39:38,460
Was it eight with APM,

1534
00:39:38,461 --> 00:39:39,060
they started,

1535
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:43,350
that shit would go straight onto til two
o'clock in the fucking morning and the

1536
00:39:43,351 --> 00:39:46,830
place would be packed back and
there was a hundred comics looking

1537
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:52,450
people at seven leave at 10 and another
hundred people come at 10 30 and leave

1538
00:39:52,451 --> 00:39:52,820
at two.

1539
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,020
It was a legit,

1540
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:57,410
they were legit comics out of that scene.

1541
00:39:57,411 --> 00:39:58,730
They were good comics,

1542
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,610
but the scene crumbled and
a lot of guys stayed there.

1543
00:40:01,611 --> 00:40:02,960
And guys that jettisoned,

1544
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:04,130
they came to la with,

1545
00:40:04,131 --> 00:40:05,630
they didn't find success quick enough.

1546
00:40:05,631 --> 00:40:07,010
It wasn't what they
thought it was going to be.

1547
00:40:07,011 --> 00:40:08,780
They didn't adapt for whatever reason.

1548
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,730
And we lost a lot of guys who like,

1549
00:40:10,731 --> 00:40:11,481
in my opinion,

1550
00:40:11,481 --> 00:40:12,100
you know,

1551
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,850
could have been like fucking all,

1552
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:14,871
all time.

1553
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:15,710
Funny guys,

1554
00:40:15,711 --> 00:40:17,480
really fucking funny guys.

1555
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:18,321
They just,

1556
00:40:18,321 --> 00:40:19,101
whatever reason,

1557
00:40:19,101 --> 00:40:20,720
they never got out of that Houston scene.

1558
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:23,420
But that Houston scene
was a mother fucker man.

1559
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:28,130
It's Kinison and Hicks left behind
the remanence of that scene.

1560
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,900
They started it when they had that,

1561
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:30,650
uh,

1562
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:31,490
the annex,

1563
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:31,860
the,

1564
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:32,840
the comedy annex,

1565
00:40:32,841 --> 00:40:36,230
which was in Houston and that's
where s Kennison was just on fire.

1566
00:40:36,231 --> 00:40:36,830
Man.

1567
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:38,300
He was just coming out of the gates gun.

1568
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:42,680
He was so unique that his opening
acts would all sound like him.

1569
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:44,990
They'd all stop talking like Yam.

1570
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,970
They all would do like his cadence.

1571
00:40:46,971 --> 00:40:47,870
They couldn't help it.

1572
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:50,180
It's like they thought it
was so hypnotized by him.

1573
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,490
They thought that might be
the only way to do comedy now.

1574
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:53,180
You know,

1575
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:53,780
and they,

1576
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,260
they would,

1577
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,280
they would go on stage,

1578
00:40:55,281 --> 00:40:56,360
like you would watch them and be like,

1579
00:40:56,361 --> 00:40:58,130
this guy's like doing
a Kennison impression.

1580
00:40:58,131 --> 00:40:58,964
This is weird.

1581
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,580
That's how much of a motherfucker he was.

1582
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,200
And so when Kennison left,

1583
00:41:03,201 --> 00:41:03,591
it was just,

1584
00:41:03,591 --> 00:41:04,101
boom,

1585
00:41:04,101 --> 00:41:06,530
just left this ripple of a community.

1586
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:07,491
And you know,

1587
00:41:07,491 --> 00:41:11,210
there's all in Jimmy Pineapple and all
these other guys that the toured with

1588
00:41:11,211 --> 00:41:12,680
them and that we're a part of the outlaws.

1589
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,061
No,

1590
00:41:13,061 --> 00:41:14,450
they were all sort of left behind.

1591
00:41:14,451 --> 00:41:15,284
And some guys,

1592
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,210
some guys survived and some guys didn't.

1593
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:18,650
But that was,

1594
00:41:18,651 --> 00:41:19,130
uh,

1595
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:19,811
that was the,

1596
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:20,051
the,

1597
00:41:20,051 --> 00:41:20,261
the,

1598
00:41:20,261 --> 00:41:20,571
the,

1599
00:41:20,571 --> 00:41:20,990
the,

1600
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:22,730
the burst of that scene.

1601
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:25,700
It was Kennison and then fucking nothing,

1602
00:41:25,701 --> 00:41:26,060
man.

1603
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:26,301
No,

1604
00:41:26,301 --> 00:41:26,990
nothing.

1605
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:27,300
You know,

1606
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:27,561
I mean,

1607
00:41:27,561 --> 00:41:28,700
I know they had the comedy,

1608
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,241
what'd they call it,

1609
00:41:29,241 --> 00:41:32,330
the comedy union going for awhile
and we got the Houston Improv,

1610
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:32,811
you know,

1611
00:41:32,811 --> 00:41:33,590
and Houston Improv.

1612
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:34,150
How's that?

1613
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:34,340
I,

1614
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,930
you know she had open mic nights.

1615
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,700
I think they have open
mic night on Wednesday,

1616
00:41:37,701 --> 00:41:38,534
but not like that.

1617
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:40,460
Got of open Mike Nights.

1618
00:41:40,461 --> 00:41:41,294
They don't understand.

1619
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:44,150
But I think they have a couple
of rooms around town in Houston.

1620
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:44,750
Yeah.

1621
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,380
I haven't talked to slit other laptops.

1622
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,780
Done the new laptops.

1623
00:41:47,781 --> 00:41:48,131
Done right.

1624
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:48,351
Done.

1625
00:41:48,351 --> 00:41:49,140
Everything's done.

1626
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,510
The last spot is done.

1627
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:51,373
That's done too.

1628
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,660
So all that's left is to comedy showcase,

1629
00:41:53,661 --> 00:41:58,440
which is on the south side and the Improv
or theater or the house of Blues there

1630
00:41:58,441 --> 00:41:58,851
as well.

1631
00:41:58,851 --> 00:41:59,420
Poppy,

1632
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:03,050
the Improv must've closed a lot of places
down because they get the top talent.

1633
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,480
Like if you're going to a
town and there's an Improv,

1634
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,160
that's the top talent,

1635
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:07,491
you know,

1636
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:08,181
it always is.

1637
00:42:08,181 --> 00:42:08,541
It's always,

1638
00:42:08,541 --> 00:42:10,370
you look at the line that was Jim brewer.

1639
00:42:10,371 --> 00:42:10,940
It's this guy,

1640
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:11,691
Tracy Morgan.

1641
00:42:11,691 --> 00:42:13,970
It's always like top named guys,

1642
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:14,631
you know?

1643
00:42:14,631 --> 00:42:17,210
So what a club like that
moves into your town.

1644
00:42:17,211 --> 00:42:18,890
It's probably hard to be the last stop.

1645
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:23,630
And now I think the only reason because
it's that they didn't keep up the same

1646
00:42:23,631 --> 00:42:24,441
level of quality.

1647
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:28,190
They have like local headliners who was
like one of the few places where like

1648
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,720
San Francisco's one,

1649
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:30,800
um,

1650
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,970
Denver's one and Boston's another
one where you have like legit local

1651
00:42:34,971 --> 00:42:35,804
headliners,

1652
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:40,190
but like there's nobody talks about
like legit local Chicago headliners.

1653
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:43,100
How many guys are like in Chicago that
are just headline and clubs around

1654
00:42:43,101 --> 00:42:43,934
Chicago?

1655
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:44,923
There's not that many.

1656
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:45,770
Larry Reed,

1657
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:46,520
I reread,

1658
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:46,701
but he,

1659
00:42:46,701 --> 00:42:48,170
but he's been around for a long,

1660
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:50,230
who else was out of Chicago?

1661
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:50,990
But I knew there's a,

1662
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:52,610
there's a funny fucking guy.

1663
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:56,490
I always forget his name and that's a
shame because I thought he was one of the

1664
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:59,330
best monologist I ever saw on stage.

1665
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,040
And when I,

1666
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:00,950
you don't remember his name?

1667
00:43:00,951 --> 00:43:01,161
No,

1668
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:04,820
he's a school teacher and he's got like
four kids and he doesn't like traveling.

1669
00:43:04,821 --> 00:43:08,480
So he just does yoga rooms and
then anything local in Chicago.

1670
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:11,770
But the story goes that one night
he was on stage in the room.

1671
00:43:11,771 --> 00:43:14,690
It was in the old days when
Kennison would do a theater,

1672
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:17,720
he would go right to the local
comedy club and get onstage.

1673
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:18,410
Really?

1674
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:21,620
So they said that one night they
told him before that night they go,

1675
00:43:21,621 --> 00:43:22,430
look,

1676
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:25,180
we don't want to offend you but kinnisons
coming in and when they come in and

1677
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:27,620
we're going to give you like you get off,

1678
00:43:27,621 --> 00:43:28,454
we'll pay you.

1679
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:32,690
And they said there Kennison came and I
had worked with him in myrtle beach and

1680
00:43:32,691 --> 00:43:33,920
I left in awe of him.

1681
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:36,600
He had one bit about
getting on a bus and a,

1682
00:43:36,601 --> 00:43:37,580
but I was just dying.

1683
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:38,893
And uh,

1684
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:42,650
somebody told me the story years later
that kindness and came in and they were

1685
00:43:42,651 --> 00:43:42,771
like,

1686
00:43:42,771 --> 00:43:43,880
we'll get them off the stage.

1687
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:47,650
Can if somebody ordered a drink and
started listening to a guy and go down and

1688
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:49,640
let me watch the guy.

1689
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:51,300
That's how good they get.

1690
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:53,000
He's a brutal now he's got,

1691
00:43:53,001 --> 00:43:54,590
this is 10 years ago
when I worked with him.

1692
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:54,900
Well,

1693
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:55,360
I can't say,

1694
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,670
must have been a fan of comedy and you
know how you can't get that good without

1695
00:43:58,671 --> 00:43:59,504
being a fam,

1696
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,080
you know,

1697
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,700
told the guy you want to go on the road.

1698
00:44:01,701 --> 00:44:02,540
And the guys like Doug,

1699
00:44:02,541 --> 00:44:03,374
I'm dead.

1700
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:05,990
I got a wife and kid and
I'm a school teacher.

1701
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:07,910
It kind of seems like if you
ever fucking come though,

1702
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:08,753
ain't look me up.

1703
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:10,160
While he's a great kid,

1704
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:11,060
he still works.

1705
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,620
He still works locally.

1706
00:44:12,621 --> 00:44:12,890
You know,

1707
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:15,740
it's nice when you find new town on the
road and that's where we found Thomas a

1708
00:44:15,741 --> 00:44:16,100
girl.

1709
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:16,721
When we did that,

1710
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:18,050
a maximum comedy tour.

1711
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,030
Thomas the girl was one
of the opening acts.

1712
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:21,860
They would have a new
opening act and every place,

1713
00:44:21,861 --> 00:44:22,610
and you know some,

1714
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:23,450
some guys are pretty good,

1715
00:44:23,451 --> 00:44:24,830
but Tommy really stood out.

1716
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:25,491
I was like,

1717
00:44:25,491 --> 00:44:27,410
this kid's fucking pool.

1718
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:28,370
Is Tommy Cigar?

1719
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,200
The nicest guy I haven't had,

1720
00:44:30,201 --> 00:44:33,000
haven't lately have coffee with
Bert Kreischer three times a week.

1721
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:33,810
Beautiful.

1722
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:34,890
Two blocks from my house,

1723
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:35,610
you know,

1724
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:38,490
now I can meet Chris Mcguire to Starbucks.

1725
00:44:38,491 --> 00:44:40,380
You just wrapped up the burn,

1726
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,480
the burn and it had the
wrap party last night.

1727
00:44:42,481 --> 00:44:42,691
You know,

1728
00:44:42,691 --> 00:44:44,100
I was with Brody this morning.

1729
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:45,700
We know a lot of really nice pieces.

1730
00:44:45,701 --> 00:44:46,291
Yeah Bro.

1731
00:44:46,291 --> 00:44:46,741
We're really like,

1732
00:44:46,741 --> 00:44:46,921
you know,

1733
00:44:46,921 --> 00:44:47,940
Tony High and cliff,

1734
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:48,490
you know,

1735
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:50,040
it's grody said a joke last night.

1736
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:52,380
That motherfucker's bathroom bone.

1737
00:44:52,381 --> 00:44:56,430
Tony Hinchliffe Brody said a joke last
night and the burn and I immediately knew

1738
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,170
fucking Tony wrote it.

1739
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:00,750
That's how much of a fan
I am a Tony's about that.

1740
00:45:00,751 --> 00:45:04,140
He goes to Mcdonald's as
he eats the happy meal,

1741
00:45:04,141 --> 00:45:06,450
but he keeps the burger
or something like that.

1742
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:07,680
Something very witty.

1743
00:45:07,681 --> 00:45:07,951
I don't,

1744
00:45:07,951 --> 00:45:09,270
I'm not giving it justice,

1745
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,550
but it made me fucking lame
stuff's a very good writer.

1746
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:12,361
And I knew he was,

1747
00:45:12,361 --> 00:45:13,050
it was Tony's.

1748
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:13,883
I knew it was totally,

1749
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,370
we were real lucky that we know somebody,

1750
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:18,140
uh,

1751
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:18,661
many cool,

1752
00:45:18,661 --> 00:45:20,060
funny and nice people and they were like,

1753
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:21,360
we all feed off of each other.

1754
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:22,080
You know,

1755
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:27,080
that's a very important part of any
like real strong seen a real strong

1756
00:45:27,421 --> 00:45:28,254
community,

1757
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:28,770
you know.

1758
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:31,260
And I think we're a part of a very strong,

1759
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:31,861
uh,

1760
00:45:31,861 --> 00:45:33,570
and fun stand up community.

1761
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,050
You know,

1762
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:35,580
this is a more,

1763
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,890
more of a community now I think,

1764
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:38,790
uh,

1765
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:41,040
at this stage in our lives
than it's ever been before.

1766
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:43,890
And we think about all the people
that were like networked with,

1767
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:44,970
you know,

1768
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:48,000
it's pretty unusual and how
everybody is doing so well.

1769
00:45:48,001 --> 00:45:50,700
Like I just got off the phone with Aubrey,

1770
00:45:50,701 --> 00:45:55,020
went down to see a Ari and
a in Austin last weekend.

1771
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:55,540
Yeah.

1772
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:57,120
And it was talking to Ari was like,

1773
00:45:57,390 --> 00:46:00,840
are you fucking headlined
the Cap City Comedy Club?

1774
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:04,230
Like that's legit at Cap
City Comedy Club in Austin.

1775
00:46:04,231 --> 00:46:05,520
That is a legit weekend.

1776
00:46:05,521 --> 00:46:09,510
You headlined a legit club and for the
longest time dude couldn't get booked

1777
00:46:09,511 --> 00:46:09,971
places.

1778
00:46:09,971 --> 00:46:10,560
No.

1779
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,371
And now you know,

1780
00:46:11,371 --> 00:46:13,200
you see him headlining a legit place.

1781
00:46:13,201 --> 00:46:13,501
It's like,

1782
00:46:13,501 --> 00:46:13,831
wow,

1783
00:46:13,831 --> 00:46:18,831
this is seeing your friends prosper and
seeing people around you prosper and

1784
00:46:19,081 --> 00:46:21,390
seeing them grow and seeing them do shit.

1785
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:22,770
That's hilarious on stage,

1786
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:23,371
man.

1787
00:46:23,371 --> 00:46:24,960
It's like nothing more energizing.

1788
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:28,920
There's not nothing more beneficial to
you as a person and your growth and your

1789
00:46:28,921 --> 00:46:32,520
own inspiration because it's like
inspiration without jealousy.

1790
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:34,110
It's inspiration without,

1791
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:34,710
you know,

1792
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:38,040
without any of the negative
aspects attached to it,

1793
00:46:38,041 --> 00:46:41,310
like no fear or insecurity that's
causing you to be inspired to action.

1794
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,820
Now you're just inspired by watching
somebody else do what you do,

1795
00:46:44,821 --> 00:46:45,930
someone that you love,

1796
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:47,370
so you like watching them up.

1797
00:46:47,371 --> 00:46:48,090
They're killing,

1798
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:48,511
you know,

1799
00:46:48,511 --> 00:46:49,730
four years ago I was very,

1800
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:51,240
this solution with this business.

1801
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:51,960
What are you really?

1802
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:52,231
Yeah.

1803
00:46:52,231 --> 00:46:56,160
It was after the Carlos thing and the
comedy store when they all went back and

1804
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:57,840
there was no real solidarity.

1805
00:46:57,841 --> 00:47:02,280
I became a comic because of people like
Lenny Bruce that he would do comedy and

1806
00:47:02,281 --> 00:47:06,300
then shoot over to Chelsea and shoot
heroine with the jazz musicians and fuck a

1807
00:47:06,301 --> 00:47:07,020
stripper.

1808
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:11,490
That was the lifestyle I wanted when I
was 28 I was a little crazy and I was

1809
00:47:11,491 --> 00:47:12,181
content with that.

1810
00:47:12,181 --> 00:47:13,440
I couldn't handle a family.

1811
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:14,850
I was pretty content with that.

1812
00:47:14,851 --> 00:47:16,400
Knowing you content with that is great.

1813
00:47:16,401 --> 00:47:17,580
That was a little disenchanted.

1814
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:19,210
I'm not going to lie to nobody.

1815
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,570
I didn't want to do it and I didn't want
to hang out with those fucking people

1816
00:47:21,571 --> 00:47:22,590
at the store ever again.

1817
00:47:22,591 --> 00:47:23,300
I didn't want to see him.

1818
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:23,720
The,

1819
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:26,370
the real problem was
when that all went down,

1820
00:47:26,371 --> 00:47:30,010
everybody sorta pussied out
except and stuff for you

1821
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:30,843
and Ari,

1822
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:31,751
you and Ra.

1823
00:47:31,751 --> 00:47:34,600
We're the only ones already took
like a year off of that place.

1824
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:35,410
And you never went,

1825
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:35,891
I take,

1826
00:47:35,891 --> 00:47:38,800
I take my friends and family
series because at the end
of that it's all you got.

1827
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:39,643
I got no family.

1828
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:40,000
Yeah.

1829
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,260
So and on top of that,

1830
00:47:41,261 --> 00:47:42,760
I know the old saying,

1831
00:47:42,761 --> 00:47:42,971
you know,

1832
00:47:42,971 --> 00:47:45,010
you got to close one door
before another one opens.

1833
00:47:45,011 --> 00:47:45,940
We were done at the store.

1834
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:46,960
I was done at the store.

1835
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:47,860
Uh,

1836
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:48,431
and uh,

1837
00:47:48,431 --> 00:47:50,950
I went and applied for a job
as a car fucking salesman.

1838
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:51,850
I took the Piss test.

1839
00:47:51,851 --> 00:47:53,470
But like I obviously think melted.

1840
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:55,240
So the THC,

1841
00:47:55,241 --> 00:47:56,260
so they never called back.

1842
00:47:56,261 --> 00:47:58,270
They were scared and all of a sudden,

1843
00:47:58,271 --> 00:48:00,010
what kind of cars are
we going to sell for it?

1844
00:48:00,011 --> 00:48:00,731
Right on my block.

1845
00:48:00,731 --> 00:48:01,564
Friendly for it.

1846
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:02,231
I could sell it.

1847
00:48:02,231 --> 00:48:02,411
Like,

1848
00:48:02,411 --> 00:48:02,620
listen,

1849
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:03,640
I can sell chariots.

1850
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:04,810
I don't give a fuck.

1851
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:05,320
You come in,

1852
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,400
I'll sell you a champion.

1853
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:07,293
You know what I'm saying?

1854
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:11,433
You know me dog.

1855
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:12,460
I said you're fucking cherry.

1856
00:48:12,461 --> 00:48:13,294
It don't matter.

1857
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,130
You know the car I'm selling today.

1858
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,540
This is the best car on the market.

1859
00:48:16,541 --> 00:48:17,710
This particular car today,

1860
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:18,820
fucking Mercedes,

1861
00:48:18,821 --> 00:48:20,890
this is for tourists
or rocky fucking world.

1862
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:22,630
Even though in the back
of my head I don't,

1863
00:48:22,631 --> 00:48:22,841
you know,

1864
00:48:22,841 --> 00:48:24,190
but uh,

1865
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:24,790
you know,

1866
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:29,790
I opened for you when July in Irvine
and there was no Twitter then and there

1867
00:48:30,701 --> 00:48:31,451
were five shows.

1868
00:48:31,451 --> 00:48:35,260
It was 4th of July weekend and the place
was sold that and that was the first

1869
00:48:35,261 --> 00:48:38,620
time I was ever impressed
with the computer and all
the years I was around you

1870
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:41,230
then I did a podcast here
with you about two years ago.

1871
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:42,071
You got the tape,

1872
00:48:42,071 --> 00:48:43,330
the footage is on youtube,

1873
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:43,960
right.

1874
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,120
Sat here and said to,

1875
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,330
I didn't want to be on Twitter.

1876
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,340
I didn't want to be on Facebook.

1877
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:49,450
You guys got the footage.

1878
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:50,380
I eat my words dog.

1879
00:48:50,381 --> 00:48:51,214
I'm a big boy.

1880
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:55,390
And I started fucking around on Twitter
cause you started telling me and I

1881
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:56,260
started doing it.

1882
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:59,830
Just how I seen everybody was
fucking up just writing jokes,

1883
00:48:59,831 --> 00:49:00,550
bro.

1884
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:00,941
You know,

1885
00:49:00,941 --> 00:49:02,710
every week or every three days,

1886
00:49:02,711 --> 00:49:03,101
and I go,

1887
00:49:03,101 --> 00:49:03,670
deep dog,

1888
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:04,360
I don't give a fuck.

1889
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,500
You got to go deep on Twitter.

1890
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:07,540
If you want some mother fucking retweets,

1891
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:09,430
you got to take them into murky waters,

1892
00:49:09,431 --> 00:49:10,390
whatever the fuck you say.

1893
00:49:10,391 --> 00:49:11,224
You know,

1894
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:12,910
I tell you man,

1895
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:15,370
these people on Twitter are my family now.

1896
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,080
I retweeted on CNN the other day.

1897
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:17,920
Oh fuck yeah.

1898
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:18,620
Fuck yeah.

1899
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:18,810
No,

1900
00:49:18,810 --> 00:49:18,981
no,

1901
00:49:18,981 --> 00:49:19,151
no.

1902
00:49:19,151 --> 00:49:19,751
It's amazing.

1903
00:49:19,751 --> 00:49:21,460
It's the only one in the
whole Chris Brown story.

1904
00:49:21,461 --> 00:49:22,510
They retweeted my tweet.

1905
00:49:22,511 --> 00:49:22,961
I was like,

1906
00:49:22,961 --> 00:49:23,380
yes.

1907
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:23,710
Yeah.

1908
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:24,790
Of all the Shit I've done.

1909
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:26,020
That was like a real accomplished.

1910
00:49:26,021 --> 00:49:26,290
Yes.

1911
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:26,411
Oh,

1912
00:49:26,411 --> 00:49:27,550
you feel like fucking great,

1913
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:28,330
don't you?

1914
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:28,751
I was like,

1915
00:49:28,751 --> 00:49:29,350
yes,

1916
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:31,480
but it's amazing what's
going on right now.

1917
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:34,330
I've never loved stand up more than that.

1918
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,970
I am turning down audition.

1919
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:37,330
If they're not in my realm,

1920
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:39,610
I don't want to bother with that world.

1921
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:41,710
No one else figured that out recently,

1922
00:49:41,711 --> 00:49:42,490
Brian Cowen.

1923
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:42,850
Yeah.

1924
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:44,740
It's all at the exact same garden.

1925
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:45,311
I don't want to,

1926
00:49:45,311 --> 00:49:45,881
I don't want to do it.

1927
00:49:45,881 --> 00:49:47,830
It's not elevating me
is not making me happy.

1928
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:48,541
You're going to call it.

1929
00:49:48,541 --> 00:49:50,170
They call me in for two broke girls.

1930
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:51,370
Two in the afternoon.

1931
00:49:51,371 --> 00:49:52,960
They want to be to be
there at five 30 really?

1932
00:49:52,961 --> 00:49:53,621
Who the fuck are you?

1933
00:49:53,621 --> 00:49:54,454
I don't have a life.

1934
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:54,971
First of all,

1935
00:49:54,971 --> 00:49:55,691
you got to respect me.

1936
00:49:55,691 --> 00:49:56,331
That's number one.

1937
00:49:56,331 --> 00:49:57,250
There's a fucking man.

1938
00:49:57,490 --> 00:49:59,170
Number two for a Goomba.

1939
00:49:59,171 --> 00:49:59,891
I'm the Goombas.

1940
00:49:59,891 --> 00:50:00,724
Am I gonna play?

1941
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:02,020
How's it going to change my life?

1942
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,720
So somebody going to see me
at eight o'clock at night?

1943
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:05,501
I turned it down.

1944
00:50:05,501 --> 00:50:08,590
I want to do it unless it's something
great now I don't want to do it.

1945
00:50:08,591 --> 00:50:10,060
I'm very content with what I'm doing.

1946
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:11,980
I'm very content with the stand up.

1947
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:13,750
I'm very content with the writing.

1948
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:16,300
I'm content with this circle right now.

1949
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:17,590
We have people around us,

1950
00:50:17,591 --> 00:50:18,250
dog.

1951
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:19,450
I don't have anybody around me.

1952
00:50:19,451 --> 00:50:20,680
I don't want to have no more.

1953
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:21,580
I get out,

1954
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:22,450
I work out.

1955
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:25,750
I meet people for coffee and now
the Duncan and Brian made up.

1956
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:26,111
Yeah,

1957
00:50:26,111 --> 00:50:26,291
no,

1958
00:50:26,291 --> 00:50:26,440
no.

1959
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,640
The positive is not perfect now.

1960
00:50:28,641 --> 00:50:29,750
That ain't no stopping us.

1961
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:30,830
These people are done.

1962
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,890
They created a monster and
we created it all on Twitter.

1963
00:50:33,891 --> 00:50:34,724
And I love it.

1964
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:36,430
I love my people on Twitter.

1965
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:37,251
Twitter is big,

1966
00:50:37,251 --> 00:50:38,840
but the podcast is the biggest thing.

1967
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:39,321
They know.

1968
00:50:39,321 --> 00:50:40,760
They know you because of this.

1969
00:50:40,761 --> 00:50:43,820
Twitter is just the way they stay in
touch with you and go down and dirty with

1970
00:50:43,821 --> 00:50:45,650
these motherfuckers on
Twitter and they feel me.

1971
00:50:45,651 --> 00:50:46,360
They feel the [inaudible]

1972
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:46,760
most of the,

1973
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:48,110
so it's all everything.

1974
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:49,850
It's a combination of all these things.

1975
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:50,530
It's uh,

1976
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:51,980
it's your standup being funny.

1977
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:52,690
It's the,

1978
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:53,900
the Twitter you'd be,

1979
00:50:53,901 --> 00:50:56,750
you'd be able to connect with them and
it's the podcast where they get to know

1980
00:50:56,751 --> 00:50:56,901
you.

1981
00:50:56,901 --> 00:50:58,070
It's all those things above,

1982
00:50:58,071 --> 00:51:02,090
but it's all those things that just didn't
exist for us just a little while ago,

1983
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:03,020
you know,

1984
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:05,990
and the impact that it has
now since fucking nuts.

1985
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:07,400
Brian went on stage in Sacramento.

1986
00:51:07,401 --> 00:51:08,660
They went berserk.

1987
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:09,920
They went berserk.

1988
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:11,120
I insisted ladies,

1989
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:11,701
gentleman,

1990
00:51:11,701 --> 00:51:12,070
you know,

1991
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:12,620
have iPod.

1992
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:13,453
God Man.

1993
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:18,170
Brian went from the stage
and he called ca collect.

1994
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:21,140
That's how brains so ca collect.

1995
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:23,600
Tell Him Brian Red Bolt.

1996
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:23,990
Yeah,

1997
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:24,823
it's fine.

1998
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:26,500
And then I went up right.

1999
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:28,530
Probably had one of the best
heads I've ever had in my life.

2000
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:28,830
I,

2001
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:29,080
um,

2002
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:29,430
I've,

2003
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:30,870
I'm having these new sets now.

2004
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:31,390
My set,

2005
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:32,223
sir,

2006
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:34,700
I've got all this new shit
I'm working on and it's,

2007
00:51:34,701 --> 00:51:35,610
it's so fun.

2008
00:51:35,611 --> 00:51:38,820
It's all these new light
weapons and turns and it's like,

2009
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:42,150
this is shit that didn't even exist
a month ago and it's crushing.

2010
00:51:42,151 --> 00:51:42,391
You know,

2011
00:51:42,391 --> 00:51:42,721
it's like,

2012
00:51:42,721 --> 00:51:46,080
it's so exciting to watch you just pop
out of the ground and become a fucking

2013
00:51:46,081 --> 00:51:46,890
tree.

2014
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:47,221
You know?

2015
00:51:47,221 --> 00:51:47,371
It's,

2016
00:51:47,371 --> 00:51:48,210
it's really fun,

2017
00:51:48,211 --> 00:51:48,481
man.

2018
00:51:48,481 --> 00:51:49,314
It's exciting.

2019
00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:50,320
Joined the people.

2020
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:51,970
I never used to enjoy the people.

2021
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:52,580
Yeah,

2022
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:53,231
the comedy.

2023
00:51:53,231 --> 00:51:54,070
It's always dumped.

2024
00:51:54,071 --> 00:51:54,910
People coming up to me,

2025
00:51:54,911 --> 00:51:55,744
a fat man.

2026
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:58,180
These people call me fat man,

2027
00:51:58,181 --> 00:51:59,014
but they love me.

2028
00:51:59,020 --> 00:51:59,381
They love.

2029
00:51:59,381 --> 00:52:00,610
So it's a different fat man.

2030
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:01,300
I love it.

2031
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:02,133
I love it that the,

2032
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:02,980
we communicate.

2033
00:52:02,981 --> 00:52:03,814
We smoked dope.

2034
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:06,040
I wasn't at the mall of America last week,

2035
00:52:06,041 --> 00:52:06,874
bitch.

2036
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:07,751
The mall,

2037
00:52:07,751 --> 00:52:08,950
a motherfucker in America.

2038
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:13,510
We had 60 people up on that fucking
garage panel puffing like savages.

2039
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:14,231
You know,

2040
00:52:14,231 --> 00:52:15,520
people brought cookies.

2041
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:17,381
This is it.

2042
00:52:17,381 --> 00:52:18,214
This is a movement.

2043
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:20,720
He shouldn't talk about
the sunlight because a Ari,

2044
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:21,020
uh,

2045
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:21,853
almost got arrested.

2046
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:22,960
Who gives a fuck?

2047
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:24,993
He got arrested.

2048
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:27,610
He got arrested because he's playing
that hunt for the edible thing.

2049
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:28,630
We ain't got time for that.

2050
00:52:28,631 --> 00:52:31,750
What are you can somebody
emailed me today in Chicago.

2051
00:52:31,751 --> 00:52:34,490
You're going to go to play
hunt for the yellow pan.

2052
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:35,890
I'm going to fucking adult dog.

2053
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:36,973
Got a skateboard?

2054
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:38,080
No.

2055
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:38,381
Are,

2056
00:52:38,381 --> 00:52:39,340
you can't do that shit.

2057
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:42,980
Ari was doing it when he was just in
Texas last week and he was doing it.

2058
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:44,710
Was he doing it online?

2059
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:46,023
Yeah.

2060
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:46,420
Oh,

2061
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:46,820
sorry.

2062
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:47,130
No,

2063
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:47,330
no,

2064
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:47,490
no,

2065
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:47,690
no,

2066
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:48,523
no.

2067
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:50,180
That is super illegal.

2068
00:52:50,181 --> 00:52:51,170
He gets set up.

2069
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:52,730
Has got to be careful.

2070
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:54,780
One one follower that doesn't like them.

2071
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:55,190
Well,

2072
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:58,170
I don't think he's aware of
the repercussions of getting
busted and that mother

2073
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:58,551
Fucker,

2074
00:52:58,551 --> 00:52:59,271
he'll go to jail.

2075
00:52:59,271 --> 00:52:59,751
No sons.

2076
00:52:59,751 --> 00:53:02,360
Antiquey you'll get that little
[inaudible] he's over though.

2077
00:53:02,361 --> 00:53:02,841
Shave it.

2078
00:53:02,841 --> 00:53:03,920
They'll put some fucking,

2079
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:08,270
some fucking whatever the fuck they put
in your ads before they bang it and you

2080
00:53:08,271 --> 00:53:08,421
know,

2081
00:53:08,421 --> 00:53:08,881
it ain't fun.

2082
00:53:08,881 --> 00:53:09,950
Especially in Texas.

2083
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:12,620
I couldn't imagine doing time now anyway.

2084
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:13,670
Did they have air conditioning?

2085
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:15,220
Oh yeah.

2086
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:17,150
Marketing a swimming pool.

2087
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:18,470
Massages.

2088
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:19,331
Oh yeah,

2089
00:53:19,331 --> 00:53:19,550
yeah,

2090
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:19,731
yeah.

2091
00:53:19,731 --> 00:53:20,564
They got everything.

2092
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:21,381
Stakes.

2093
00:53:21,381 --> 00:53:23,030
Lots of tales on Sunday.

2094
00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:24,470
Get the fuck.

2095
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,130
The only personal gives you massage.

2096
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:27,570
That is against your will.

2097
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:29,690
You don't know what it is
to get a massage again.

2098
00:53:29,770 --> 00:53:30,361
She was like,

2099
00:53:30,361 --> 00:53:32,640
you can fight this or
we could take the ride.

2100
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:36,030
You might get a happy ending
and you might get choked to him.

2101
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:37,081
I would,

2102
00:53:37,081 --> 00:53:37,470
uh,

2103
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:42,210
I would want to teach a few dudes
Jujitsu and just have impromptu sparring

2104
00:53:42,211 --> 00:53:45,660
sessions where you don't
just teach a few dudes.

2105
00:53:45,661 --> 00:53:48,090
You just say to keep your
shit sharp and then just,

2106
00:53:48,091 --> 00:53:48,370
uh,

2107
00:53:48,370 --> 00:53:48,691
all right,

2108
00:53:48,691 --> 00:53:48,901
come on,

2109
00:53:48,901 --> 00:53:49,200
let's go.

2110
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,033
We're going to roll here.

2111
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:52,560
Lay some mattresses down and go at it.

2112
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:54,390
And as long as you teach him some shit,

2113
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:57,810
maybe they'll offer you good sparring
partners and then maybe you could at least

2114
00:53:57,811 --> 00:54:02,340
keep up a level of fitness and it's
trying to stay alive when the joy,

2115
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:03,383
yeah.

2116
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:04,591
You know,

2117
00:54:04,591 --> 00:54:05,000
man,

2118
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,470
I mean you don't want to go in there
because of a hunt for the animals.

2119
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:08,333
No.

2120
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,290
Cause then they're going to
hunt for your fucking edible,

2121
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:11,720
your ass hole.

2122
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:12,930
Deep,

2123
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:13,350
deep,

2124
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:17,010
deep in the murky waters of that muscle
aren't gets baked with people after

2125
00:54:17,011 --> 00:54:17,401
shows.

2126
00:54:17,401 --> 00:54:18,300
I don't do that anymore.

2127
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:20,610
You're not smoking when people see me too.

2128
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:24,900
I had a guy come up to me then I was
positive it was a cop once and I was like,

2129
00:54:24,901 --> 00:54:25,201
all right,

2130
00:54:25,201 --> 00:54:26,340
this is ridiculous.

2131
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:27,540
I just,

2132
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:27,961
I didn't,

2133
00:54:27,961 --> 00:54:28,351
you know,

2134
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:30,300
I also knew somebody that had um,

2135
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:32,850
something putting his
pot that it wasn't pot.

2136
00:54:32,851 --> 00:54:33,220
It doesn't,

2137
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:34,530
still to this day doesn't know what it is.

2138
00:54:34,531 --> 00:54:35,364
It might've been math.

2139
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:37,650
Might've been someone
sprinkled math on down the

2140
00:54:39,230 --> 00:54:39,570
road.

2141
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:40,300
Dude,

2142
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:42,090
seven tried to give me DMT in Sacramento.

2143
00:54:42,970 --> 00:54:43,860
Who knows what that is.

2144
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:44,440
Yeah.

2145
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,140
That's like schedule it,

2146
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:51,060
it gets really shady cause that's like
super illegal shit and we already know

2147
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:53,040
that people have been set up in the past.

2148
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,420
Like you gotta really think about that.

2149
00:54:54,421 --> 00:54:59,400
Like that's the 15 year old kid who was
arrested in Florida because a undercover

2150
00:54:59,401 --> 00:55:00,870
cop pretend to be in
high school with them,

2151
00:55:00,871 --> 00:55:02,160
flirted with them and got them.

2152
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:03,630
You buy into that shit.

2153
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:04,473
Look,

2154
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:07,110
this is what you're doing in California.

2155
00:55:07,111 --> 00:55:07,620
Okay.

2156
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:09,840
What heads when you
declare yourself a head,

2157
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:10,920
it's a different story.

2158
00:55:10,921 --> 00:55:11,754
We're not stoners.

2159
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:12,720
That's 13 year olds.

2160
00:55:12,721 --> 00:55:13,650
I look at high times.

2161
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:14,370
I'm a head,

2162
00:55:14,370 --> 00:55:14,581
okay,

2163
00:55:14,581 --> 00:55:16,590
we're smoking dope 30 fucking years.

2164
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:17,070
No,

2165
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:17,903
none of use a head.

2166
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:18,621
No,

2167
00:55:18,621 --> 00:55:19,454
no,

2168
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:20,820
no.

2169
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:22,500
You guys are head bolt as a head.

2170
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,110
It's a fucking understanding.

2171
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:25,410
It's an understanding.

2172
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:29,160
It's an understanding pro and I could
tell when I look at some of these eyes,

2173
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:30,750
I won't take edibles that much.

2174
00:55:30,751 --> 00:55:30,961
Eat.

2175
00:55:30,961 --> 00:55:33,240
I don't like the fucking big
thing or a chocolate bar,

2176
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:34,500
but if somebody comes to me,

2177
00:55:34,501 --> 00:55:36,760
I could tell when they have real REFA.

2178
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,280
I could tell because their heads,

2179
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,140
they're not drunk and not sloppy.

2180
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,240
I could tell I had just mow go,

2181
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:43,860
you don't fuck with nothing else.

2182
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:45,390
When I look at his eyes and I go,

2183
00:55:45,391 --> 00:55:46,190
what'd you listen to?

2184
00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:47,180
And it was a dog at Harrison.

2185
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,033
Sabbath was,

2186
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:49,313
it's a head.

2187
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:50,071
It's a head.

2188
00:55:50,071 --> 00:55:50,904
When I was done,

2189
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:51,753
I want to shoot myself.

2190
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:52,830
That type of shit.

2191
00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:53,760
Their heads.

2192
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,410
Then they quit on themselves.

2193
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:57,180
It wouldn't harm themselves,

2194
00:55:57,181 --> 00:55:57,780
Bro.

2195
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:59,190
I've been doing this for 30 years.

2196
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:00,270
Ain't nobody gonna set you up.

2197
00:56:00,271 --> 00:56:01,710
Or if you smoke a joint with somebody,

2198
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:02,843
how,

2199
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:03,271
how,

2200
00:56:03,271 --> 00:56:05,640
how am I going to set you up in that
light if you smoke a joint with somebody,

2201
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:06,480
if,

2202
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:06,710
if,

2203
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:07,890
even if I'm in fucking,

2204
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:10,530
but I tell you got an
offer from a weed store,

2205
00:56:10,531 --> 00:56:11,190
Michigan.

2206
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:12,540
The fly me out and do comedy.

2207
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:13,111
Really Nice.

2208
00:56:13,111 --> 00:56:13,830
Number two.

2209
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:14,663
Hell yeah.

2210
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:15,511
Oh yeah.

2211
00:56:15,511 --> 00:56:16,344
Fuck yeah.

2212
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:17,430
Fuck yeah.

2213
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:17,850
Why not?

2214
00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:18,690
What's the name of the store?

2215
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:19,081
I don't know.

2216
00:56:19,081 --> 00:56:20,370
They didn't send me all the details.

2217
00:56:20,371 --> 00:56:21,450
They just went mad flavor.

2218
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:22,141
You gotta change it.

2219
00:56:22,141 --> 00:56:22,381
Twitter,

2220
00:56:22,381 --> 00:56:23,214
we need Joey d,

2221
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:25,450
You know Jim's got Joey Diaz on Twitter.

2222
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,240
Let me checked me.

2223
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:28,233
You do.

2224
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:29,950
I'm the baddest motherfucker
you got involve.

2225
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:30,641
Joey D is,

2226
00:56:30,641 --> 00:56:31,090
yeah,

2227
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:31,923
but anyway,

2228
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:34,300
the problem is no business
giving them bad bro.

2229
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:34,900
You know,

2230
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:37,390
I heard in New York in
the 70s on Halloween,

2231
00:56:37,391 --> 00:56:40,570
they would put razor blades and
apples and give them to kids.

2232
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:41,320
You know what?

2233
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:42,790
If you ate an apple on Halloween,

2234
00:56:42,791 --> 00:56:43,720
go fuck yourself.

2235
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,640
You're supposed to go to
for the fucking doe Ray.

2236
00:56:45,641 --> 00:56:46,060
Me,

2237
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:48,280
I never really candy and
Halloween I went for the money.

2238
00:56:48,550 --> 00:56:50,680
I went for the pennies and
the fucking dollar bills.

2239
00:56:50,681 --> 00:56:51,400
They changed.

2240
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,121
I grew up early.

2241
00:56:52,121 --> 00:56:52,960
When I came from Cuba,

2242
00:56:52,961 --> 00:56:54,460
I was in New York City
and those buildings,

2243
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:55,211
those buildings,

2244
00:56:55,211 --> 00:56:55,631
the juice,

2245
00:56:55,631 --> 00:56:56,740
they give you fucking cash.

2246
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:57,663
How much?

2247
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:00,760
A dollar a quarter and the 70s
somebody give you a fucking quarter.

2248
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:02,500
That's a little juice
drink from the hot dog,

2249
00:57:02,501 --> 00:57:03,040
man.

2250
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:03,830
You know I'm not going to,

2251
00:57:03,830 --> 00:57:04,570
don't listen.

2252
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:07,210
Take your little m and m's and all
this shit and shove it up your ass.

2253
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:10,630
Isn't it strange when you really think
back about the price of shit when you

2254
00:57:10,631 --> 00:57:11,111
were a kid?

2255
00:57:11,111 --> 00:57:14,860
When you see like comic books for 25
cents and you think about how ridiculous,

2256
00:57:14,861 --> 00:57:17,080
like you hear like what
someone's wage was.

2257
00:57:17,081 --> 00:57:20,050
He got $5 a week working for
the ranch and you're like,

2258
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:21,003
what?

2259
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:26,140
What's the price for tickets now for a
concert like a hundred and fifth well,

2260
00:57:26,141 --> 00:57:27,490
didn't you say Bob Dylan?

2261
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:27,761
Oh,

2262
00:57:27,761 --> 00:57:28,870
two 25 and yeah.

2263
00:57:28,930 --> 00:57:29,761
What's the guy say to us?

2264
00:57:29,761 --> 00:57:32,290
$300 that's what we are in Santa Barbara.

2265
00:57:32,291 --> 00:57:34,080
I think he said three fifth and Madison.

2266
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,450
February 24th look it up.

2267
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:40,960
1980 I paid $15 and 50 cents
for pink Floyd the wall.

2268
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,080
And that's where the service tag,

2269
00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:45,460
we have a service tax they have now you
know what Tom is just service tax was

2270
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:45,820
what?

2271
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:46,653
50 cents?

2272
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:48,580
That was dollars.

2273
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:51,440
Now it's like $5 more than that is it?

2274
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:52,893
You think about it.

2275
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:55,090
So in 30 years to the,

2276
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:57,460
so let's say it doubles every 10 years,

2277
00:57:58,030 --> 00:58:00,130
it should be 60 $70 for a ticket.

2278
00:58:00,131 --> 00:58:03,310
Why are we paying 300 200
for a ticket for anything?

2279
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:04,630
This was pink Floyd,

2280
00:58:04,631 --> 00:58:04,990
the wall.

2281
00:58:04,990 --> 00:58:05,950
That's as good as it gets.

2282
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:07,540
Why at the Nassau Coliseum?

2283
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:07,691
Well,

2284
00:58:07,691 --> 00:58:10,480
it's just weird how everything
got more expensive like that,

2285
00:58:10,481 --> 00:58:13,900
that weird thing of inflation
that I never really,

2286
00:58:13,901 --> 00:58:14,860
totally understood.

2287
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:17,950
Like why does why the things have
to get more expensive every year?

2288
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:18,761
But it does.

2289
00:58:18,761 --> 00:58:20,110
Why does gas have to get more expensive?

2290
00:58:20,111 --> 00:58:20,620
Who Does?

2291
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:21,850
Why do people have to make more money?

2292
00:58:21,851 --> 00:58:22,151
I don't know.

2293
00:58:22,151 --> 00:58:23,470
But they do and it just keeps,

2294
00:58:23,471 --> 00:58:25,780
the number gets higher and yeah,

2295
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:26,590
people are,

2296
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:28,720
I mean for sure if you have more money,

2297
00:58:28,721 --> 00:58:29,890
you're going to be able
to buy more things,

2298
00:58:29,891 --> 00:58:33,070
but then when those more things
costs more money as well,

2299
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:35,230
you're just raising the numbers,

2300
00:58:35,231 --> 00:58:36,760
but it all balances itself out.

2301
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:37,600
It's just so,

2302
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:42,340
it's a weird sort of a trend to me that
things constantly get more expensive,

2303
00:58:42,370 --> 00:58:44,680
constantly get more
expensive like no one's ever,

2304
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:46,590
they're not going to
lock in iPhone and say,

2305
00:58:46,591 --> 00:58:50,230
Ladies and gentlemen is iPhone is $200
it would be $200 to the end of fucking

2306
00:58:50,231 --> 00:58:50,710
time.

2307
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:55,030
The iPhone 80 that comes out will be
$200 that's what we're charging for a

2308
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:55,721
fucking iPhone.

2309
00:58:55,721 --> 00:58:58,420
You can't say that because you don't
know what the fuck $200 is going to be

2310
00:58:58,421 --> 00:58:59,560
worth in 20 years.

2311
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,300
You don't know what it's
going to be worth in a decade.

2312
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:04,000
You don't know what it's going to be
worth if the fucking economy collapses,

2313
00:59:04,001 --> 00:59:04,834
like in Russia,

2314
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,250
like it went down in the Soviet Union,

2315
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:07,420
like it's going down in Greece.

2316
00:59:07,690 --> 00:59:07,961
I mean,

2317
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:08,651
Greece is a,

2318
00:59:08,651 --> 00:59:13,300
they're really running a very real
possibility of leaving the European Union.

2319
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:15,400
That's going to fuck the dollar up.

2320
00:59:15,401 --> 00:59:16,840
It's going to fuck everybody up.

2321
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:18,101
What happens then?

2322
00:59:18,101 --> 00:59:18,330
It was,

2323
00:59:18,330 --> 00:59:18,760
well,

2324
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:21,870
how much does it cost to get your car
washed now is at $18 you know what?

2325
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,380
How much do you get an
hour is minimum wage?

2326
00:59:24,381 --> 00:59:25,460
$20 an hour now,

2327
00:59:25,461 --> 00:59:25,701
you know,

2328
00:59:25,701 --> 00:59:27,560
it gets at a certain point in time
that's going to keep going up.

2329
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:30,470
Told Julia the day that I was
out of touch with reality,

2330
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:32,030
but I went car shopping.

2331
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:32,420
Yeah.

2332
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:34,040
I sold cars for 10 years,

2333
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:35,031
a four runner.

2334
00:59:35,031 --> 00:59:40,031
When I quit selling cars of 22,000 loaded
with the fucking under Greece and the

2335
00:59:40,101 --> 00:59:41,750
fucking stars and Colorado,

2336
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:47,110
it's 40 $50,000 for $20,000 I
looked at a Honda last week.

2337
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:50,510
It was 10 years old with
a hundred thousand miles.

2338
00:59:50,511 --> 00:59:54,740
They still want to 13 grant and
the blue book is 14 five wow.

2339
00:59:54,830 --> 00:59:55,960
Kelley blue book or you know me.

2340
00:59:55,970 --> 00:59:56,810
I know all that shit.

2341
00:59:56,811 --> 00:59:57,290
I fucked him.

2342
00:59:57,290 --> 00:59:57,981
Look at that stuff.

2343
00:59:57,981 --> 00:59:59,900
I have friends in the car
because I called Colorado.

2344
00:59:59,901 --> 01:00:00,734
I asked around,

2345
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:02,930
I was even thinking of getting
a car shipped from Colorado,

2346
01:00:02,931 --> 01:00:04,040
from my buddy and I'm the,

2347
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,780
he's the general manager
of one month Toyota.

2348
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:08,230
They gave me a fucking dollar
over invoice right away.

2349
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:08,751
Give a fuck.

2350
01:00:08,751 --> 01:00:08,961
He goes,

2351
01:00:08,961 --> 01:00:09,761
come get the car.

2352
01:00:09,761 --> 01:00:10,900
So I'm thinking about doing that.

2353
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:11,960
I'm trying to put it together.

2354
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:13,243
Uh,

2355
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:14,070
it's just,

2356
01:00:14,070 --> 01:00:15,200
I was out of touch.

2357
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:16,760
You know what helps me,

2358
01:00:16,761 --> 01:00:17,810
the prices and things,

2359
01:00:18,050 --> 01:00:18,771
like I told you,

2360
01:00:18,771 --> 01:00:18,981
you know,

2361
01:00:18,981 --> 01:00:21,380
we live around here
with BMWs and Mercedes,

2362
01:00:21,381 --> 01:00:22,214
so we forget.

2363
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:23,960
But I go to Pittsburgh and I watch,

2364
01:00:23,961 --> 01:00:24,800
I go to Houston,

2365
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:25,960
I go to all of those cities.

2366
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:26,760
I look at these people,

2367
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:28,670
I look at the people that come
into the shows and I'm like,

2368
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:29,271
Bro,

2369
01:00:29,271 --> 01:00:30,170
we're in fucking Trump.

2370
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:32,900
I look at these malls
empty across America.

2371
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:34,410
Empty Bro more.

2372
01:00:34,411 --> 01:00:35,510
I'm America is one thing.

2373
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:35,721
They,

2374
01:00:35,721 --> 01:00:36,171
you know what I'm saying?

2375
01:00:36,171 --> 01:00:38,210
Everybody wants to have a
business at the mall of America.

2376
01:00:38,390 --> 01:00:39,030
Have you been there,

2377
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:42,170
Jim Zine to make motherfucking paper?

2378
01:00:42,650 --> 01:00:43,341
Minneapolis?

2379
01:00:43,341 --> 01:00:44,480
I was very impressed.

2380
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:45,320
I mean the airport,

2381
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:47,030
just 10 minutes from mall of America,

2382
01:00:47,330 --> 01:00:47,961
not dirty.

2383
01:00:47,961 --> 01:00:49,580
They designed that city.

2384
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:51,260
So they get your pocket,

2385
01:00:51,261 --> 01:00:52,010
you land,

2386
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:53,750
there's 22 airports and each amp,

2387
01:00:53,751 --> 01:00:56,200
what hasn't shut up to the mall
of America every 10 minutes later,

2388
01:00:56,540 --> 01:00:57,110
bro.

2389
01:00:57,110 --> 01:00:59,570
It's for sinking land just to shop,

2390
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:01,640
which you could land just to shop.

2391
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:02,300
Damn.

2392
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:03,800
Four floors deep.

2393
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,500
Fucking four floors deal exercise in it.

2394
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:06,660
Oh,

2395
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:07,610
you to see this thing.

2396
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:08,690
You got to see this thing.

2397
01:01:08,930 --> 01:01:11,840
And then they have an whole area
where you're an amusement park.

2398
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:13,810
Used to be a fucking dead.

2399
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:15,620
It used to be the old twin stadium.

2400
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:17,750
So think of a fucking stadium,

2401
01:01:17,751 --> 01:01:18,920
a baseball stadium.

2402
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:20,480
And that's just a little piece of it.

2403
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:21,621
That's just,

2404
01:01:21,621 --> 01:01:22,400
I walked around,

2405
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,410
the one day was an hour and a half walk.

2406
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:25,220
Wow.

2407
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:26,390
He walked around the whole thing.

2408
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:27,081
Fucking hold her.

2409
01:01:27,081 --> 01:01:28,010
I didn't go up the stairs.

2410
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:28,670
Don't get me wrong.

2411
01:01:28,670 --> 01:01:31,500
It's like a carry the way my
Gaultier fuck that I'm talking about.

2412
01:01:31,501 --> 01:01:33,020
But I walked around that mall.

2413
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:34,311
Wow.

2414
01:01:34,311 --> 01:01:35,150
Fucking mall.

2415
01:01:35,330 --> 01:01:37,790
But it tells me that Bro,

2416
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:38,810
this country's in trouble.

2417
01:01:38,811 --> 01:01:40,160
We were talking about
the phone that they have,

2418
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:43,400
they don't have five pound bag of sugar
is normal because the price of sugar

2419
01:01:43,401 --> 01:01:43,671
went up.

2420
01:01:43,671 --> 01:01:45,650
You have to buy it by the
pound or three pound bags.

2421
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:47,150
Gas has gone up.

2422
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:48,650
Everything has gone up,

2423
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:50,180
but the price of cocaine,

2424
01:01:50,181 --> 01:01:51,560
it's still 35 at Graham.

2425
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:52,700
You said it went down.

2426
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:53,593
It went down.

2427
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:57,170
It was 40 or 62 years ago
when last time I bought blow,

2428
01:01:57,171 --> 01:01:59,930
five years ago it was
60 I go to open padre,

2429
01:01:59,931 --> 01:02:01,910
pick up the grant for
50 if the guy was high,

2430
01:02:01,911 --> 01:02:02,744
you know what I'm saying?

2431
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:04,480
If I had been there a couple of times now,

2432
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:09,580
35 $35 you get jazzed up foot
and it's better than ever.

2433
01:02:10,161 --> 01:02:11,720
They say better than ever.

2434
01:02:12,070 --> 01:02:13,310
Gives you your skin rash.

2435
01:02:13,311 --> 01:02:15,170
Don't fucking heroin.

2436
01:02:15,590 --> 01:02:16,700
Did you read about heroin?

2437
01:02:16,701 --> 01:02:19,650
Did you read about new weed in
New York City amongst teens?

2438
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:20,220
What

2439
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:20,580
I mean,

2440
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:21,000
oh,

2441
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,710
teens are going nuts in New York city.

2442
01:02:22,711 --> 01:02:23,260
We thought we'd,

2443
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:25,320
and so his eyes good.

2444
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:26,190
More of it.

2445
01:02:26,190 --> 01:02:26,911
Now what are we going to do?

2446
01:02:26,911 --> 01:02:29,180
Give may dd pills and SOS,

2447
01:02:29,181 --> 01:02:30,510
but why don't you get these fucking,

2448
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:30,961
you know,

2449
01:02:30,961 --> 01:02:32,850
at a certain point in time it's becomes,

2450
01:02:32,851 --> 01:02:33,390
okay,

2451
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:34,051
I don't know what it is.

2452
01:02:34,051 --> 01:02:36,090
17 1819 whatever it is.

2453
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:37,830
You think it's okay for you.

2454
01:02:37,831 --> 01:02:39,510
If you have a good childhood,

2455
01:02:39,511 --> 01:02:40,560
if you have good parents,

2456
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:41,760
go for it.

2457
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:42,390
But it's not,

2458
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:42,751
I don't,

2459
01:02:42,751 --> 01:02:43,584
I don't buy that.

2460
01:02:43,830 --> 01:02:44,670
That's going to hurt you.

2461
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:47,430
I don't think it's going to
hurt 18 year olds are this day.

2462
01:02:47,431 --> 01:02:49,380
Say that if you smoke
it when you're young,

2463
01:02:49,470 --> 01:02:51,740
that it can diminish your Iq.

2464
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:52,300
I've,

2465
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:52,861
I've heard that,

2466
01:02:52,861 --> 01:02:53,131
but I'm like,

2467
01:02:53,131 --> 01:02:54,000
how do you find that out?

2468
01:02:54,001 --> 01:02:54,990
You take two people,

2469
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:57,180
make them live the exact
same circumstances,

2470
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:57,751
you know,

2471
01:02:57,751 --> 01:02:59,810
and get one of them high
and one of them doesn't.

2472
01:02:59,830 --> 01:03:01,050
They both follow the same diet.

2473
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:02,610
They both have the same genetics.

2474
01:03:02,611 --> 01:03:03,300
They're twins.

2475
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:03,931
But other than that,

2476
01:03:03,931 --> 01:03:05,760
how the fuck are you gonna tell
me that that's what's going on.

2477
01:03:05,910 --> 01:03:07,620
How do you know what his Iq would've been?

2478
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:08,721
Who you're not you,

2479
01:03:08,721 --> 01:03:10,110
you're just extrapolating.

2480
01:03:10,111 --> 01:03:10,351
You know,

2481
01:03:10,351 --> 01:03:13,740
there's a lot of other
environmental factors that
could lead to someone being in

2482
01:03:13,741 --> 01:03:17,010
an area where there's a disproportionate
portion amount of people with a low Iq.

2483
01:03:17,490 --> 01:03:17,791
You know,

2484
01:03:17,791 --> 01:03:22,260
it's the Iq test itself is not really
necessarily a good judge of intelligence.

2485
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:25,020
Cause a little bit is about
understanding how tests work.

2486
01:03:25,170 --> 01:03:28,590
So I really fucking smart people that
just don't know how this test works and

2487
01:03:28,591 --> 01:03:28,671
they,

2488
01:03:28,671 --> 01:03:28,871
they,

2489
01:03:28,871 --> 01:03:29,081
they,

2490
01:03:29,081 --> 01:03:32,040
they know how to be very
intelligent in their own world.

2491
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:35,430
They didn't know how to be
very intelligent in their
own occupation or their

2492
01:03:35,431 --> 01:03:35,730
own,

2493
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:38,300
their own world in a way that you
wouldn't be able to plug into.

2494
01:03:38,530 --> 01:03:41,310
It's just because you write some fucking
shit on a piece of paper that requires

2495
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:41,980
thinking.

2496
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:45,120
It doesn't mean this is a real accurate
measurement of real intelligence,

2497
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:47,210
usable intelligence
because it just doesn't,

2498
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:48,661
you know,

2499
01:03:48,661 --> 01:03:50,460
real intelligence is social intelligence.

2500
01:03:50,461 --> 01:03:52,560
There's a lot of people
that are socially brilliant.

2501
01:03:52,770 --> 01:03:54,840
I mean how many guys we met
that aren't that good looking,

2502
01:03:54,841 --> 01:03:56,040
but they're always getting laid.

2503
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,420
Everybody loves him.

2504
01:03:57,540 --> 01:03:59,100
People come around and grabbing them.

2505
01:03:59,101 --> 01:04:00,540
They can't wait to hear him talk.

2506
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:01,231
What is that?

2507
01:04:01,231 --> 01:04:02,730
That's a social intelligence is a,

2508
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:04,110
there's a talent to that.

2509
01:04:04,111 --> 01:04:07,710
There's something to that and
to discount that is silly.

2510
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:08,910
And to say that,

2511
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:09,150
you know,

2512
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:11,580
the only kind of intelligence should
be standing in front of a computer,

2513
01:04:11,581 --> 01:04:12,301
punch in numbers.

2514
01:04:12,301 --> 01:04:14,880
And that's stupid because
there's a social intelligence.

2515
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:20,100
If a guy can talk some crazy freak who's
never done it before and to sucking his

2516
01:04:20,101 --> 01:04:20,551
dick in a,

2517
01:04:20,551 --> 01:04:21,630
in an alleyway somewhere,

2518
01:04:21,631 --> 01:04:22,590
I can't believe I'm doing this.

2519
01:04:22,770 --> 01:04:24,630
That's in social
intelligence that he allowed,

2520
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:25,140
you know,

2521
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:26,070
he pulled that off.

2522
01:04:26,090 --> 01:04:26,700
Yeah.

2523
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:27,710
I mean that's what you saying.

2524
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:28,501
You could sell cars.

2525
01:04:28,501 --> 01:04:29,760
That's a social intelligence.

2526
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:30,773
You're like,

2527
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:33,180
wall,

2528
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:34,230
I saw you and you are,

2529
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:36,090
you are a black belt and talking,

2530
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:36,211
oh,

2531
01:04:36,211 --> 01:04:36,980
I don't give a fuck.

2532
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:37,290
You know,

2533
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:38,370
get down with the best of them.

2534
01:04:38,371 --> 01:04:39,240
All that you know.

2535
01:04:39,241 --> 01:04:39,910
And bold.

2536
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:43,290
It's tough to talk to those people
like a rock and boulder because social

2537
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:44,161
assembly real.

2538
01:04:44,161 --> 01:04:44,431
Yeah,

2539
01:04:44,431 --> 01:04:45,510
they're very intelligent.

2540
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:45,960
You know?

2541
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,100
Can I get this on a grant?

2542
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:47,611
You know,

2543
01:04:47,611 --> 01:04:48,680
those people in Boulder

2544
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:52,950
love Djo told me there's once
a friend of mine said to me,

2545
01:04:52,951 --> 01:04:53,580
Bro,

2546
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:56,910
you have to forgive these people in
bold because some of these astronauts,

2547
01:04:57,130 --> 01:04:58,890
you know at the university there,

2548
01:04:58,891 --> 01:05:03,891
so their intellect is so high that they
have no social skills has been sucked

2549
01:05:04,591 --> 01:05:04,711
in.

2550
01:05:04,711 --> 01:05:07,230
It's not that they're assholes
are trying to be bad people,

2551
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:08,520
is that they really,

2552
01:05:08,521 --> 01:05:09,331
the introverts,

2553
01:05:09,331 --> 01:05:10,140
they don't know.

2554
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:10,560
It's,

2555
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:11,820
and I understand that shit.

2556
01:05:11,821 --> 01:05:15,050
I understand between the guy that's
a dick and there's a guy that uh,

2557
01:05:15,270 --> 01:05:16,980
has his fucking face in a book.

2558
01:05:17,210 --> 01:05:17,500
Yeah.

2559
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,320
And He loves it and he doesn't
care about the outcome.

2560
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,610
They don't concentrate on social shit.

2561
01:05:21,650 --> 01:05:26,260
They just don't blow the blow up.

2562
01:05:26,261 --> 01:05:27,094
What

2563
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:31,060
Dan and then,

2564
01:05:31,061 --> 01:05:31,740
and then,

2565
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:32,530
and then,

2566
01:05:32,530 --> 01:05:32,871
then,

2567
01:05:32,871 --> 01:05:33,340
then,

2568
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:36,490
then it told you when I was
heavy into martial arts,

2569
01:05:36,491 --> 01:05:37,780
but I was like a teenager.

2570
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:41,350
I would get like social anxiety
when I had to talk to somebody.

2571
01:05:41,410 --> 01:05:44,200
I would get anxious if I had talked
to somebody in return a video.

2572
01:05:44,410 --> 01:05:45,310
If I would get anxious,

2573
01:05:45,311 --> 01:05:46,410
if I would go to uh,

2574
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:46,701
the,

2575
01:05:46,701 --> 01:05:46,811
uh,

2576
01:05:46,811 --> 01:05:48,280
the mailbox and get something,

2577
01:05:48,281 --> 01:05:50,800
or if I go to the bank
and deposit a check,

2578
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:54,880
I would get socially anxiety and anxiety
where I couldn't talk very well for no

2579
01:05:54,881 --> 01:05:57,580
reason because I just wasn't
used to talking to people.

2580
01:05:57,610 --> 01:05:58,750
All I wanted to do was train.

2581
01:05:58,751 --> 01:06:00,400
So it was just training
and fighting all day.

2582
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:05,260
It was just locked into this one form
in my mind where most of my day was

2583
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:08,530
dedicated to movements and
learning how to strike things.

2584
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:11,710
And then I would go out into the outside
world and I would be really awkward.

2585
01:06:11,890 --> 01:06:12,700
It's real weird.

2586
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:13,720
Lasted a couple of years,

2587
01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:14,501
stand up,

2588
01:06:14,501 --> 01:06:15,334
changed it for me,

2589
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:17,590
teaching and stand up.

2590
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:21,370
The two things that changed
it for teaching made stand
up easier because it was

2591
01:06:21,371 --> 01:06:21,521
tea.

2592
01:06:21,521 --> 01:06:23,680
I would teach whole classes and uh,

2593
01:06:23,681 --> 01:06:25,450
I got used to being able to do that.

2594
01:06:25,451 --> 01:06:29,050
Used to be able to talk in front of
classes and explain the right way to get,

2595
01:06:29,051 --> 01:06:29,680
you know,

2596
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,690
Mo momentum and technique.

2597
01:06:31,691 --> 01:06:33,520
And all this different shit
that was kind of complicated.

2598
01:06:33,730 --> 01:06:34,930
And when I explained it to the class,

2599
01:06:34,931 --> 01:06:36,940
I would get more and more confidence
because I was doing that when I was a

2600
01:06:36,941 --> 01:06:37,450
teenager.

2601
01:06:37,450 --> 01:06:37,940
You know,

2602
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:39,280
get your black belt this week.

2603
01:06:39,281 --> 01:06:41,640
You'll end John Shot Black Ron bank.

2604
01:06:41,710 --> 01:06:44,410
Kleefish Ron van Cleef.

2605
01:06:44,411 --> 01:06:44,581
You know,

2606
01:06:44,581 --> 01:06:45,414
I was still working out.

2607
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:47,140
There's a video of him online,

2608
01:06:47,230 --> 01:06:48,550
I think he's even older than that,

2609
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:50,050
but I think he's in his sixties.

2610
01:06:50,350 --> 01:06:52,360
He's got 63 Rodney tournament,

2611
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:53,800
I think he was 62 years old.

2612
01:06:53,801 --> 01:06:54,910
He fought in a karate tournament.

2613
01:06:55,810 --> 01:06:57,260
Bright six.

2614
01:06:57,610 --> 01:06:58,860
I heard Dan and assign throat.

2615
01:06:58,861 --> 01:07:00,640
Just got his brown belt in Jujitsu,

2616
01:07:00,670 --> 01:07:01,420
but did he really?

2617
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:01,541
Oh,

2618
01:07:01,541 --> 01:07:03,310
you 70 Dan Inosanto.

2619
01:07:03,311 --> 01:07:05,210
I believe it's got to
be sacked on Jujitsu.

2620
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:05,950
He's,

2621
01:07:05,950 --> 01:07:07,210
I think he's been involved in,

2622
01:07:07,211 --> 01:07:11,750
in Jujitsu for old nice guy was in Marina
del Ray and he still teaches Jeet Kune

2623
01:07:11,751 --> 01:07:12,370
Dough.

2624
01:07:12,370 --> 01:07:12,760
Well,

2625
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:13,030
yeah.

2626
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:13,391
Yeah.

2627
01:07:13,391 --> 01:07:15,430
I mean Eric Paulson was
one of his students,

2628
01:07:15,431 --> 01:07:16,264
I believe.

2629
01:07:16,270 --> 01:07:16,570
Uh,

2630
01:07:16,570 --> 01:07:17,900
Paulson is a,

2631
01:07:17,901 --> 01:07:21,970
a guy who's a sometimes
more famous for as a coach,

2632
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:23,190
but he was a great fighter for a while.

2633
01:07:23,190 --> 01:07:25,510
He was a shootout champion and Paulson,

2634
01:07:25,511 --> 01:07:29,520
I think the main style that he
originally claimed was [inaudible] see,

2635
01:07:29,530 --> 01:07:30,670
but if you're in a g Condo,

2636
01:07:30,671 --> 01:07:35,671
you're essentially into m and a because
with g Cuando was Bruce Lee Style and

2637
01:07:36,311 --> 01:07:38,890
the style that Bruce Lee always,

2638
01:07:39,310 --> 01:07:39,970
uh,

2639
01:07:39,970 --> 01:07:42,760
always preached was
used whatever's useful,

2640
01:07:42,970 --> 01:07:43,900
learn everything,

2641
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:44,251
learn,

2642
01:07:44,251 --> 01:07:44,561
learn,

2643
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:45,280
whatever's useful,

2644
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:46,420
whether it's boxing.

2645
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:47,200
I mean he had,

2646
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:47,831
he wrote a book,

2647
01:07:47,831 --> 01:07:48,790
the Tao of Jeet Kune do it,

2648
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:51,010
which just essentially
like copied techniques,

2649
01:07:51,130 --> 01:07:54,040
how to throw punches correctly
from old boxing manuals.

2650
01:07:54,041 --> 01:07:54,610
He was like,

2651
01:07:54,610 --> 01:07:59,350
it was like just sort of documenting all
the stuff that we know works and he had

2652
01:07:59,351 --> 01:08:03,790
some unique ideas as Bruce Lee did that
to this day are starting to be adopted

2653
01:08:03,791 --> 01:08:05,090
by people like,

2654
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:05,440
uh,

2655
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:07,350
like Bruce Lee was the,

2656
01:08:07,351 --> 01:08:08,650
the one of the first guys to say,

2657
01:08:08,730 --> 01:08:10,660
you should lead with your strong hand.

2658
01:08:10,930 --> 01:08:14,170
Because in boxing you always
lead with your jab and then your,

2659
01:08:14,171 --> 01:08:15,740
your power hand is your shorthand.

2660
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:16,910
You're your strong hand,

2661
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:18,320
which you throw less of.

2662
01:08:18,530 --> 01:08:19,251
And Bruce Lee said,

2663
01:08:19,251 --> 01:08:20,150
that doesn't make any sense.

2664
01:08:20,151 --> 01:08:22,460
You should throw more punches with your,

2665
01:08:22,461 --> 01:08:23,780
your dominant hand.

2666
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:24,010
The,

2667
01:08:24,010 --> 01:08:27,950
the jab in the hooks are more frequent
so you should lead with your more

2668
01:08:27,951 --> 01:08:28,784
dominant hand.

2669
01:08:29,090 --> 01:08:30,770
And then boxer started doing that.

2670
01:08:30,890 --> 01:08:32,300
Oscar de la Hoya and did that.

2671
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:32,840
Um,

2672
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:34,460
there's quite a few
boxers today to do that.

2673
01:08:34,461 --> 01:08:34,671
I thought,

2674
01:08:34,671 --> 01:08:35,630
I don't know if who's Julio?

2675
01:08:35,631 --> 01:08:37,310
Cesar Chavez Jr does it.

2676
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:38,810
Andre Ward does it.

2677
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:40,460
Shad Dawson does it.

2678
01:08:40,610 --> 01:08:41,630
It's really interesting man.

2679
01:08:41,631 --> 01:08:43,190
It's a lot of fighters that do that now.

2680
01:08:43,191 --> 01:08:47,210
So Bruce Lee like predicted this
shit like way back deep in the 70s.

2681
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:49,850
So when you say that a guy like
Eric Paulson is a g condo guy,

2682
01:08:49,851 --> 01:08:50,930
like anybody who's smart,

2683
01:08:50,931 --> 01:08:52,160
it's really a g condone guy.

2684
01:08:52,430 --> 01:08:53,840
Cause g can doe is just like,

2685
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:54,470
it's,

2686
01:08:54,470 --> 01:08:55,690
it's figure it all out.

2687
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:56,533
Pull it all together.

2688
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:58,600
You know what kicking from Moy Tai,

2689
01:08:58,820 --> 01:08:59,061
you know,

2690
01:08:59,061 --> 01:09:00,320
punches from karate.

2691
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:00,800
This,

2692
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:02,210
this hook from boxing.

2693
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:03,710
This is a double leg take down.

2694
01:09:03,711 --> 01:09:04,640
That's from wrestling.

2695
01:09:04,730 --> 01:09:06,560
Here's a headlock that comes from a,

2696
01:09:06,561 --> 01:09:07,250
you know,

2697
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:07,731
whatever.

2698
01:09:07,731 --> 01:09:09,270
A catch wrestling in the AA.

2699
01:09:09,271 --> 01:09:12,950
He was doing like arm bars and
shit and movies like way back.

2700
01:09:13,610 --> 01:09:14,230
Tap,

2701
01:09:14,230 --> 01:09:14,501
tap.

2702
01:09:14,501 --> 01:09:15,130
Yeah.

2703
01:09:15,130 --> 01:09:15,701
Sam Mo.

2704
01:09:15,701 --> 01:09:16,121
It's funny,

2705
01:09:16,121 --> 01:09:20,260
last night I was watching pedis against
the Joe low zone when he knocked him

2706
01:09:20,261 --> 01:09:21,094
out.

2707
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:22,223
And you said,

2708
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:23,170
uh,

2709
01:09:23,170 --> 01:09:24,190
you know that we were talking to,

2710
01:09:24,191 --> 01:09:27,130
they were talking about taekwondo
black though him and so it was Duke.

2711
01:09:27,230 --> 01:09:27,480
Yeah.

2712
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:30,230
Well I'm going to see Friday
Duke and I'm Chael Sonnen.

2713
01:09:30,550 --> 01:09:32,230
Friday Duke motherfucking roof.

2714
01:09:32,231 --> 01:09:33,130
Where are you at this weekend?

2715
01:09:33,810 --> 01:09:36,550
See German town on Friday in Milwaukee,

2716
01:09:36,790 --> 01:09:37,350

Stan hope is an hour up the road so
that state will be all fucked up.

2732
01:10:07,180 --> 01:10:07,331
Oh,

2733
01:10:07,331 --> 01:10:08,730
that's beauties up there for the weekend.

2734
01:10:08,731 --> 01:10:10,320
It was still tickets available for stand.

2735
01:10:10,450 --> 01:10:11,283
I did see that.

2736
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:13,840
And then tomorrow night I'm in Milwaukee.

2737
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:17,500
I see my man Chels Sonnen's
flying in to Duke Roufus is,

2738
01:10:17,501 --> 01:10:22,060

2739
01:10:22,061 --> 01:10:24,790
in Appleton the rest of the week
and tickets are still available.

2740
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:26,260
The skyline comedy club.

2741
01:10:26,261 --> 01:10:26,891
He's a good man.

2742
01:10:26,891 --> 01:10:27,790
Let's give some plugs.

2743
01:10:28,070 --> 01:10:29,920
A Rogun is in Toronto.

2744
01:10:30,090 --> 01:10:30,331
Brian,

2745
01:10:30,331 --> 01:10:30,680
we got it.

2746
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:33,020
Change the background to my Twitter page.

2747
01:10:33,021 --> 01:10:35,900
Can we do that because it's
still got April on there.

2748
01:10:36,530 --> 01:10:37,730
It's got march,

2749
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:38,930
April,

2750
01:10:38,990 --> 01:10:41,810
and capitalize the last one from Calgary,

2751
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:43,280
the last one I might use.

2752
01:10:43,290 --> 01:10:43,860
Stern.

2753
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:44,011
Oh,

2754
01:10:44,011 --> 01:10:44,844
did I say Twitter?

2755
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:45,220
Sorry.

2756
01:10:45,220 --> 01:10:45,631
USTREAM.

2757
01:10:45,631 --> 01:10:48,300
Ustream and somebody started
doing it and then they stopped.

2758
01:10:48,301 --> 01:10:48,870
I don't know.

2759
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:52,200
You could have someone else
there that works there,

2760
01:10:52,201 --> 01:10:52,560
right?

2761
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:52,860
Yeah,

2762
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:55,950
because it says follow Joe and get
notified every time he goes live.

2763
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:57,630
I never put that up on anything.

2764
01:10:58,370 --> 01:11:00,840
We've got a good weekend that
I think our reason Toronto,

2765
01:11:01,350 --> 01:11:03,990
check this out at NBC La.

2766
01:11:04,030 --> 01:11:09,030
I just tweeted that American Airlines
has to canceled over 300 flights this

2767
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:09,480
week.

2768
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:09,990
What?

2769
01:11:09,990 --> 01:11:10,260
So,

2770
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:12,090
I don't know why they're cancelled them,

2771
01:11:12,091 --> 01:11:14,370
but if you're flying or American Eagle,

2772
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:16,590
you might want to show
him the American Airways.

2773
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:17,521
Tamala wanna fuck.

2774
01:11:17,521 --> 01:11:18,151
Is that about,

2775
01:11:18,151 --> 01:11:18,600
I don't know.

2776
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:19,470
They just tweeted it.

2777
01:11:19,950 --> 01:11:21,060
Holy Shit.

2778
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:22,710
But they haven't said why.

2779
01:11:22,740 --> 01:11:24,510
I don't know if that
planes are all fucked or,

2780
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:25,910
oh,

2781
01:11:25,910 --> 01:11:27,780
I'm not going to fucking medicine.

2782
01:11:29,850 --> 01:11:30,690
Oh my God.

2783
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:32,390
You got to find out if
you take you for thing,

2784
01:11:32,391 --> 01:11:32,971
it's still good.

2785
01:11:32,971 --> 01:11:33,804
I gotta get Outta here.

2786
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:35,370
I'm going to Toronto this weekend.

2787
01:11:35,371 --> 01:11:38,130
They'd better not be some fucking
terrible how American Airlines,

2788
01:11:38,131 --> 01:11:38,321
right?

2789
01:11:38,321 --> 01:11:38,480
Yeah.

2790
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:38,850
No,

2791
01:11:38,850 --> 01:11:38,970

2792
01:11:38,970 --> 01:11:39,211

2793
01:11:39,211 --> 01:11:39,391

2794
01:11:39,391 --> 01:11:39,810

2795
01:11:39,810 --> 01:11:40,081
Oh,

2796
01:11:40,081 --> 01:11:40,621

2799
01:11:45,091 --> 01:11:49,310
So that's nine days from today and
that is going to set it right there.

2800
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:50,153
See that right?

2801
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:51,390
Yes.

2802
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:51,900

2806
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:55,831
Doug,

2807
01:11:55,831 --> 01:11:56,670
Stan hope,

2808
01:11:56,730 --> 01:11:57,091
honey,

2809
01:11:57,091 --> 01:11:58,380
honey and me.

2810
01:11:58,710 --> 01:11:59,161
And,

2811
01:11:59,161 --> 01:11:59,450
uh,

2812
01:11:59,450 --> 01:12:00,630
it's going to be a fucking,

2813
01:12:00,670 --> 01:12:01,080
uh,

2814
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:01,891
a festival,

2815
01:12:01,891 --> 01:12:04,080
a celebration of the end of history,

2816
01:12:04,350 --> 01:12:05,850
which we don't really
think it's going to happen.

2817
01:12:05,970 --> 01:12:06,690
We just,

2818
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:07,650
it's not really end of the world.

2819
01:12:07,651 --> 01:12:08,130
We're just,

2820
01:12:08,130 --> 01:12:09,210
we just want to have a good time.

2821
01:12:09,390 --> 01:12:13,770
So we thought it'd be fun to put on
like a super show so it will be a honey

2822
01:12:13,771 --> 01:12:14,041
honey.

2823
01:12:14,041 --> 01:12:15,000
We'll call up and they'll,

2824
01:12:15,001 --> 01:12:18,640
they'll do some songs first and then it
will be a show with dia as Stan hope in

2825
01:12:18,641 --> 01:12:21,750
myself and we're going to have a
fucking blast and can't wait to do it.

2826
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:22,591
And just a,

2827
01:12:22,591 --> 01:12:24,240
an opportunity to do something like this.

2828
01:12:24,241 --> 01:12:27,480
I don't on a regular basis in la because
we don't do too many shows in la.

2829
01:12:27,481 --> 01:12:30,540
We do a lot out here in Pasadena
and this one's going to be fun.

2830
01:12:31,050 --> 01:12:33,180
So that's going to be a September 28.

2831
01:12:33,181 --> 01:12:35,580
Those tickets go on sale and um,

2832
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:36,511
which we've chosen.

2833
01:12:36,511 --> 01:12:37,344
You and I are doing together.

2834
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:39,390
You're not yoga.

2835
01:12:39,570 --> 01:12:40,021
You can do,

2836
01:12:40,021 --> 01:12:40,141
oh,

2837
01:12:40,141 --> 01:12:40,440
that's right.

2838
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:41,310
We do in Arizona,

2839
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:43,290
Arizona and Minneapolis.

2840
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:44,460
October 19th.

2841
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:47,370
Brendan Walsh is out for Arizona man.

2842
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:48,030
Why?

2843
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:48,380
I Dunno,

2844
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:49,350
he booked something else.

2845
01:12:49,351 --> 01:12:50,430
So I reached your fee is coming.

2846
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:51,360
I thought,

2847
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:52,320
I wish if he was doing something else.

2848
01:12:52,350 --> 01:12:52,590
No,

2849
01:12:52,590 --> 01:12:52,831
I wish.

2850
01:12:52,831 --> 01:12:53,640
Feel free is coming.

2851
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:54,310
He is.

2852
01:12:54,310 --> 01:12:55,740
Or Red Banner Dunkin.

2853
01:12:55,950 --> 01:12:56,783
Somebody else.

2854
01:12:57,530 --> 01:12:58,500
Well we have to find out.

2855
01:12:59,090 --> 01:12:59,923
Find out.

2856
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:00,950
No one else is booked.

2857
01:13:00,990 --> 01:13:01,620
Who else is book?

2858
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:01,921
No,

2859
01:13:01,921 --> 01:13:03,120
she'll feel lost that weekend.

2860
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:03,860
I told him did.

2861
01:13:03,860 --> 01:13:04,090
Yeah.

2862
01:13:04,090 --> 01:13:05,790
When did he lose that week
and he said he forgot.

2863
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:07,920
You forgot that you had given it flags.

2864
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:08,993
No Way.

2865
01:13:09,330 --> 01:13:09,931
That's crazy.

2866
01:13:09,931 --> 01:13:10,764
He's crazy.

2867
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:11,521
Something happened.

2868
01:13:11,521 --> 01:13:12,061
Cause I asked him,

2869
01:13:12,061 --> 01:13:14,280
you're going to go to Arizona because
I seen Brandon Walsh and he goes,

2870
01:13:14,281 --> 01:13:15,060
no,

2871
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:17,270
I think he has Brendan first or something.

2872
01:13:17,290 --> 01:13:19,020
So he didn't know he called Shaundra.

2873
01:13:19,021 --> 01:13:19,860
I Dunno what happened.

2874
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:21,000
I don't know.

2875
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:21,930
That doesn't make sense to me,

2876
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:22,560
but that's good.

2877
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:22,951
That's good.

2878
01:13:22,951 --> 01:13:23,784
We'll figure it.

2879
01:13:23,790 --> 01:13:24,480
Well either way.

2880
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:27,450
October you and I are going to be
there so other people will be there.

2881
01:13:27,451 --> 01:13:28,141
Most likely Brian,

2882
01:13:28,141 --> 01:13:28,974
I'll be there too.

2883
01:13:29,450 --> 01:13:30,030
Um,

2884
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:31,260
did you call ca collect,

2885
01:13:31,710 --> 01:13:32,850
collect bitches?

2886
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:33,933
Like

2887
01:13:34,870 --> 01:13:35,260
fuck,

2888
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:39,150
I didn't even know FCA is
fucked it up in Sacramento.

2889
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:42,390
I want to know if you guys
are just fucking Haggen.

2890
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:45,010
Someone's saying that
the pilot thing is a,

2891
01:13:45,050 --> 01:13:45,750
it's a uh,

2892
01:13:45,750 --> 01:13:48,060
pilot strike from American Airlines.

2893
01:13:48,061 --> 01:13:48,840
That's what's going on.

2894
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:50,160
It says American Airlines,

2895
01:13:50,161 --> 01:13:50,721
American Ecos,

2896
01:13:50,721 --> 01:13:51,990
that they will cancel 300 flights.

2897
01:13:51,991 --> 01:13:55,620
It's weak to cope with the high number
of pilots reporting sick and an increase

2898
01:13:55,621 --> 01:14:00,621
in maintenance reports filed by Cruz
has shut him down the old fashion way.

2899
01:14:01,340 --> 01:14:02,460
Fucking sit outside,

2900
01:14:02,461 --> 01:14:04,800
go to the hospital and get an Mri.

2901
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:06,860
Then you say you had a
headache motherfucker.

2902
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:08,550
Yeah.

2903
01:14:08,550 --> 01:14:12,430
Woopsies they've already
canceled 249 flights this week.

2904
01:14:12,431 --> 01:14:14,800
300 by [inaudible] heard
they get paid shit.

2905
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:16,180
I heard that uh,

2906
01:14:16,210 --> 01:14:20,210
pilots that it's a like a really
a tough job to get by with it.

2907
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:21,130
They'll make good money.

2908
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:22,121
You think they would,

2909
01:14:22,121 --> 01:14:23,170
but they don't apparently.

2910
01:14:23,310 --> 01:14:24,090
Hm.

2911
01:14:24,090 --> 01:14:24,800
Yeah.

2912
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:25,210
I don't know.

2913
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:26,530
Fucking tough job man.

2914
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:31,420
Flying a whole fucking tube full of
souls through the air constantly because

2915
01:14:31,421 --> 01:14:33,970
just cause we get off the plane
don't mean their afternoon.

2916
01:14:33,971 --> 01:14:34,361
It's done.

2917
01:14:34,361 --> 01:14:36,280
Then a followup drew
and go to San Francisco.

2918
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:38,920
We'll fucking Baltimore somehow hole,

2919
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:39,401
you know,

2920
01:14:39,401 --> 01:14:40,234
and the other way.

2921
01:14:40,270 --> 01:14:41,410
And it's the other way too.

2922
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:41,891
Yeah.

2923
01:14:41,891 --> 01:14:43,360
And some of them don't
get much sleep either.

2924
01:14:43,410 --> 01:14:44,310
That scares the shit.

2925
01:14:45,140 --> 01:14:46,330
Sleep on the plane.

2926
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:50,830
12 with turn around this 12 hour turn
around and let's say they go back to the

2927
01:14:50,831 --> 01:14:50,980
room.

2928
01:14:50,980 --> 01:14:51,101
What?

2929
01:14:51,101 --> 01:14:52,120
You'd never had insomnia.

2930
01:14:52,870 --> 01:14:55,360
I've had fucking insomnia
like a motherfucker.

2931
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:58,810
They probably take ambien so
they're all fucking ambien doubt.

2932
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:00,430
I've known dudes to take ambien.

2933
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:03,400
They get all of a sudden get
real squirrely with reality.

2934
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:05,920
Reality becomes a little
slippery dolphin on them,

2935
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:07,060
you know?

2936
01:15:07,060 --> 01:15:07,810
Do you know the dudes?

2937
01:15:07,810 --> 01:15:09,460
If you ever known anybody
that needs that shit?

2938
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:10,373
Yeah.

2939
01:15:10,630 --> 01:15:10,930
Yeah.

2940
01:15:10,930 --> 01:15:15,670
Well you don't want to like when someone
needs that Ambien ship and that's all I

2941
01:15:15,671 --> 01:15:15,971
needed.

2942
01:15:15,971 --> 01:15:17,110
I did one of those,

2943
01:15:17,140 --> 01:15:19,210
I did a fucking 16th of those things.

2944
01:15:19,211 --> 01:15:20,290
Rush Limbaugh was on.

2945
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:23,740
I did the 16th I did a pill cut in half,

2946
01:15:23,980 --> 01:15:24,940
cut in half again,

2947
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:25,871
cut in half again.

2948
01:15:25,871 --> 01:15:29,770
It was an eighth or a 16th of a oxycotton
really got a friend of mine game.

2949
01:15:29,771 --> 01:15:30,430
It had a lay down.

2950
01:15:30,430 --> 01:15:31,060
Never again.

2951
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:32,180
My blood pressure dropped.

2952
01:15:32,210 --> 01:15:32,691
What's it is?

2953
01:15:32,691 --> 01:15:34,510
It rushed doing like a
hundred of those pitches.

2954
01:15:34,950 --> 01:15:36,730
That's when I thought about that.

2955
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:38,020
My heart went out to him.

2956
01:15:38,110 --> 01:15:39,050
I think it was on,

2957
01:15:39,070 --> 01:15:40,060
it was 50 a day.

2958
01:15:40,060 --> 01:15:40,680
He was doing,

2959
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:41,351
there was no,

2960
01:15:41,351 --> 01:15:41,891
I was eating,

2961
01:15:41,891 --> 01:15:42,850
I ate an eighth,

2962
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:45,550
and it was fucking mind
boggling what I felt like,

2963
01:15:45,551 --> 01:15:49,030
how bad I felt like that
just crushes your body.

2964
01:15:49,031 --> 01:15:50,410
That fucking synthetic heroin.

2965
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:51,461
Yeah.

2966
01:15:51,461 --> 01:15:54,040
And that's like one of the biggest
problems we have in this fucking country.

2967
01:15:54,041 --> 01:15:56,380
And this is one of the biggest
problems we have in this country.

2968
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:58,880
That fucking synthetic heroin.

2969
01:15:58,881 --> 01:15:59,001
No.

2970
01:15:59,001 --> 01:15:59,834
Kill your dog.

2971
01:16:00,090 --> 01:16:02,230
He'll start pissing fucking
green and shit like that.

2972
01:16:02,260 --> 01:16:02,680
Yeah.

2973
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:04,420
I guess he got up to 30 pills a day.

2974
01:16:04,421 --> 01:16:05,320
This one is saying,

2975
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:09,640
I swore I read that at one
point in time was I called,

2976
01:16:09,641 --> 01:16:10,331
I read 50.

2977
01:16:10,331 --> 01:16:11,410
That's fucking crazy.

2978
01:16:11,770 --> 01:16:12,670
That's to a pop.

2979
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:14,050
That's 25 times a day.

2980
01:16:14,051 --> 01:16:15,730
He would pop two of them if you pop fifth.

2981
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:15,941
Yeah.

2982
01:16:15,941 --> 01:16:16,631
This is his,

2983
01:16:16,631 --> 01:16:17,140
um,

2984
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:17,501
he,

2985
01:16:17,501 --> 01:16:20,290
his housekeeper got busted
buying them for him.

2986
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:21,460
Like his pitch,

2987
01:16:21,670 --> 01:16:26,670
he sent her out to go buy buy pills for
him and she said he took as many as 30

2988
01:16:26,861 --> 01:16:28,060
oxycontin's a day.

2989
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:29,680
So I don't know.

2990
01:16:30,010 --> 01:16:31,090
I don't know if she's right.

2991
01:16:31,180 --> 01:16:32,080
She could be crazy.

2992
01:16:32,081 --> 01:16:32,914
I don't know her.

2993
01:16:33,310 --> 01:16:35,230
You can't just listen to
someone that says that,

2994
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:36,513
you know?

2995
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:37,710
But those,

2996
01:16:37,710 --> 01:16:39,190
those people that take that shit,

2997
01:16:39,730 --> 01:16:40,630
that and a,

2998
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:41,740
an ambient is a,

2999
01:16:41,741 --> 01:16:44,230
is another one that's a scary one.

3000
01:16:44,470 --> 01:16:48,010
I used to sell value and when I first got
divorced in Colorado was buying and in

3001
01:16:48,011 --> 01:16:50,120
Colorado it was real
volumes with the Vietnam,

3002
01:16:50,770 --> 01:16:52,570
not these motherfucking
things that make it,

3003
01:16:52,630 --> 01:16:53,463
what's the difference?

3004
01:16:53,780 --> 01:16:54,050
Those,

3005
01:16:54,050 --> 01:16:54,431
the Mac,

3006
01:16:54,431 --> 01:16:58,090
those fives and those times with the V
in the middle where the V was cut out.

3007
01:16:58,630 --> 01:16:59,290
What did they do?

3008
01:16:59,290 --> 01:17:01,180
What volumes just put
you on another planet.

3009
01:17:01,181 --> 01:17:03,100
So I use them as to come
down from something,

3010
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:03,620
you know,

3011
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:04,900
you do an eight ball of coke,

3012
01:17:04,901 --> 01:17:05,890
it's seven in the morning.

3013
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:08,890
You got to come down and you gotta
be watching daytime television until

3014
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:09,733
lunchtime.

3015
01:17:10,870 --> 01:17:12,920
We valued and the chill out.

3016
01:17:12,921 --> 01:17:14,120
And one time in Beaumont,

3017
01:17:14,121 --> 01:17:14,391
man,

3018
01:17:14,391 --> 01:17:14,861
I owe deed.

3019
01:17:14,861 --> 01:17:17,450
I'm in my 30 of those
motherfuckers in three days.

3020
01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:21,940
This is in 2006 I had to stay in Houston
for four days at the Intercontinental.

3021
01:17:22,130 --> 01:17:23,690
I couldn't even talk
on the phone to people.

3022
01:17:23,691 --> 01:17:24,540
People hire me.

3023
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:28,820
I know this was 2005
or six I have to alone.

3024
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:30,943
I went to Houston.

3025
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:33,590
I wanted these fucking pills and the
kids like we ain't got him and we got

3026
01:17:33,591 --> 01:17:33,950
volume.

3027
01:17:33,950 --> 01:17:34,180
I said,

3028
01:17:34,180 --> 01:17:35,330
I can give me the fucking volumes.

3029
01:17:35,331 --> 01:17:36,164
What the fuck?

3030
01:17:36,250 --> 01:17:37,100
I was in Beaumont,

3031
01:17:37,101 --> 01:17:37,910
Texas.

3032
01:17:37,910 --> 01:17:38,481
The home of,

3033
01:17:38,481 --> 01:17:39,314
what's her name?

3034
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:39,710
Uh,

3035
01:17:39,710 --> 01:17:40,543
Bobby McGee.

3036
01:17:40,890 --> 01:17:41,260
He,

3037
01:17:41,260 --> 01:17:42,260
what was her fucking name?

3038
01:17:42,261 --> 01:17:43,790
The girl he used to
come to the comic store?

3039
01:17:43,910 --> 01:17:44,271
No.

3040
01:17:44,271 --> 01:17:45,410
What's the fucking cool girl?

3041
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:45,981
The one that sent it?

3042
01:17:45,981 --> 01:17:46,814
Bobby McGee.

3043
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:47,570
What's her name?

3044
01:17:47,570 --> 01:17:48,191
Me and Bobby.

3045
01:17:48,191 --> 01:17:50,500
We can take a cow man.

3046
01:17:50,610 --> 01:17:50,980
Yeah.

3047
01:17:50,980 --> 01:17:51,370
Yeah,

3048
01:17:51,370 --> 01:17:52,190
she's from Beaumont.

3049
01:17:52,190 --> 01:17:56,500
That's where a little museum is
that so Slade ham had a room.

3050
01:17:56,550 --> 01:17:57,290
Boma.

3051
01:17:57,290 --> 01:17:58,340
I get there on a Thursday.

3052
01:17:58,341 --> 01:17:59,310
I'm looking for blowing shit.

3053
01:17:59,311 --> 01:17:59,500
I'm like,

3054
01:17:59,500 --> 01:17:59,701
Bro,

3055
01:17:59,701 --> 01:18:00,170
I ain't got no,

3056
01:18:00,170 --> 01:18:00,831
we got valid.

3057
01:18:00,831 --> 01:18:02,570
Janis Joplin try anybody
who wants to know.

3058
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:02,991
I said,

3059
01:18:02,991 --> 01:18:03,471
what the fuck?

3060
01:18:03,471 --> 01:18:04,780
Give me the fucking 30 volumes,

3061
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:05,960
like all eat two or three of them.

3062
01:18:05,961 --> 01:18:07,420
I bring the rest of La and give them out.

3063
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:09,970
I know a friend who was like Valium
and as soon as you shoot them here,

3064
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:14,870
the first night,

3065
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,090
the second night,

3066
01:18:16,090 --> 01:18:17,810
eight to next day,

3067
01:18:17,820 --> 01:18:18,653
I didn't have reefer,

3068
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:22,420
I pop one in for lunch that night I went
to the club and I started drinking them

3069
01:18:22,421 --> 01:18:23,280
a fucking Nigga.

3070
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:27,140
Meisters now where people don't know about
volumes as they sit your fucking fat.

3071
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:30,410
So you eat a 10 milligram Valium,

3072
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:34,310
five of it goes into your body of
the five goes into your fucking fat.

3073
01:18:34,670 --> 01:18:37,670
So what happens is the next day when
you wake up and you drink your water

3074
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:40,700
thinking you're all healthy and you
hit that fucking one hit of a joint,

3075
01:18:40,701 --> 01:18:42,560
that volume kicks right back up again.

3076
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:43,641
But what are you do?

3077
01:18:43,641 --> 01:18:44,960
You put a tenant side of you?

3078
01:18:45,290 --> 01:18:49,210
So now you got the five that you popped
and the five that's motherfucking

3079
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:50,083
lurking in there.

3080
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:52,070
So now you're popping these every day.

3081
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:54,080
That's why I love when the
people tell me that he values,

3082
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:56,210
cause this shit just pops up in your fat.

3083
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:57,530
You will never get that out of.

3084
01:18:57,540 --> 01:18:58,101
And people.

3085
01:18:58,101 --> 01:19:00,830
We volumes 50% of them when
they go to the fucking gym,

3086
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:02,870
so that just just in your factory,

3087
01:19:02,871 --> 01:19:06,320
every time you touch alcohol you
smoke a shaker and a smoker volume.

3088
01:19:06,321 --> 01:19:08,750
It just kicks that Shit back
until your system is shit.

3089
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:10,790
It's amazing until it just piles up.

3090
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,380
So I bought 30 of them.

3091
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:13,520
Dirty,

3092
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:17,810
dirty was a Thursday night at 11 when
I got him the first night I pop one,

3093
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,760
the next day I pop one
that none of that pop.

3094
01:19:19,761 --> 01:19:23,480
Two or three of them drank Yeager by
Saturday I pop two in the afternoon.

3095
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:25,280
I couldn't fall asleep.

3096
01:19:25,370 --> 01:19:27,200
I went to the club after club,

3097
01:19:27,201 --> 01:19:28,310
I had a brown bag.

3098
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:29,900
I didn't know what was in there.

3099
01:19:29,940 --> 01:19:32,690
It wasn't like an a week container
and I just kept popping up,

3100
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:34,521
tricking Yeager,

3101
01:19:34,521 --> 01:19:38,450
mice to the second show I had to do on
a stool and the management knew I was

3102
01:19:38,451 --> 01:19:39,284
whacked out.

3103
01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:42,230
They pay me my money.

3104
01:19:42,231 --> 01:19:44,720
I buy an eight ball from chick,

3105
01:19:44,721 --> 01:19:45,650
gives me a number,

3106
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:47,090
but in the fucking dilemma,

3107
01:19:47,091 --> 01:19:47,811
I didn't give a fuck her.

3108
01:19:47,811 --> 01:19:48,501
She had a boyfriend.

3109
01:19:48,501 --> 01:19:49,520
She told me she had to go home,

3110
01:19:49,850 --> 01:19:50,661
wait for the boyfriend.

3111
01:19:50,661 --> 01:19:52,820
I went home by myself and
did the fucking eight ball,

3112
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:55,460
called the dealer and
then called the chicken.

3113
01:19:55,461 --> 01:19:55,791
She was like,

3114
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:57,140
I'm ready to come over and suck your Dick.

3115
01:19:57,141 --> 01:19:59,000
Now she comes over with the dealer,

3116
01:19:59,001 --> 01:19:59,834
comes over.

3117
01:19:59,930 --> 01:20:04,280
I leave with him and he
takes me deep into the Boma.

3118
01:20:04,310 --> 01:20:06,500
More fucking Caribou down there.

3119
01:20:07,790 --> 01:20:08,611
Just some Christian was,

3120
01:20:08,611 --> 01:20:08,901
gosh,

3121
01:20:08,901 --> 01:20:09,840
I'm good old Christians.

3122
01:20:09,841 --> 01:20:14,430
I was selling some cocaine straight
from fucking Noriega's dash four in the

3123
01:20:14,431 --> 01:20:14,791
morning.

3124
01:20:14,791 --> 01:20:16,350
My jaw would drive him back.

3125
01:20:16,351 --> 01:20:17,310
I'm fucking paranoid.

3126
01:20:17,330 --> 01:20:18,330
We're going to get pulled over.

3127
01:20:18,750 --> 01:20:20,640
I get back to the hotel Sunday,

3128
01:20:20,770 --> 01:20:21,750
Saturday night,

3129
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:23,220
it was Saturday going into Sunday.

3130
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:27,390
My flight southwest was leaving
at like nine from Houston.

3131
01:20:27,391 --> 01:20:27,931
I had a stoke.

3132
01:20:27,931 --> 01:20:31,080
I was getting picked up at
six 30 it's four or five.

3133
01:20:31,081 --> 01:20:32,160
I pick up another eight boy.

3134
01:20:32,161 --> 01:20:32,971
I go back to the room.

3135
01:20:32,971 --> 01:20:33,810
The chick shows up.

3136
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:35,370
She sucks my dick one time,

3137
01:20:35,371 --> 01:20:36,570
but it was so dead.

3138
01:20:37,290 --> 01:20:38,850
It was way beyond dead.

3139
01:20:38,851 --> 01:20:39,600
It was dead.

3140
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:42,810
No Houdini attend chicks from the
room sucking it fingers up my ass.

3141
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:44,250
Alpha brain,

3142
01:20:44,550 --> 01:20:44,970
nothing,

3143
01:20:44,970 --> 01:20:45,460
nothing,

3144
01:20:45,460 --> 01:20:46,140
nothing.

3145
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:47,070
Any of those pills.

3146
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:48,990
I was going straight on blow for five,

3147
01:20:48,991 --> 01:20:53,700
six hours plus the amount of volumes I
had dog at eight o'clock in the morning

3148
01:20:53,701 --> 01:20:54,720
to cocaine was gone.

3149
01:20:54,721 --> 01:20:55,770
She was all sucked up.

3150
01:20:55,771 --> 01:20:56,790
She was laying in one bed.

3151
01:20:56,791 --> 01:20:58,380
You know those hotels that have two beds?

3152
01:20:58,570 --> 01:20:58,920
Yes.

3153
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:01,320
I went to get the Brown paper
bag and stick my hand there.

3154
01:21:01,950 --> 01:21:02,910
There was nothing in there.

3155
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:04,450
I flip the bag over.

3156
01:21:04,530 --> 01:21:05,363
Nothing.

3157
01:21:05,370 --> 01:21:06,031
Here I am.

3158
01:21:06,031 --> 01:21:06,381
Join.

3159
01:21:06,381 --> 01:21:08,160
I hate dirty fucking valuable.

3160
01:21:08,370 --> 01:21:12,960
Three days I couldn't fucking believe
I drank a bunch of water and went to

3161
01:21:12,961 --> 01:21:13,410
sleep.

3162
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:13,890
Right.

3163
01:21:13,890 --> 01:21:14,401
Well,

3164
01:21:14,401 --> 01:21:15,110
Sunday,

3165
01:21:15,110 --> 01:21:17,040
maybe 10 o'clock I go to see.

3166
01:21:17,041 --> 01:21:18,270
I'm trying to fuck her at this point.

3167
01:21:18,271 --> 01:21:19,470
My Dick is flat.

3168
01:21:20,220 --> 01:21:21,180
It's got blood on it.

3169
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:26,820
I'm scratching it from trying to walk off
in the bathroom where I'm sniffing her

3170
01:21:26,821 --> 01:21:27,300
bra,

3171
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:28,380
sniffing a fucking feet,

3172
01:21:29,110 --> 01:21:32,880
something because you need to bang
something out the fall asleep.

3173
01:21:32,881 --> 01:21:33,061
Right,

3174
01:21:33,061 --> 01:21:34,710
because you're fucking all jacked up.

3175
01:21:34,711 --> 01:21:35,730
I'm trying to bang one out.

3176
01:21:36,090 --> 01:21:37,080
Next thing you know dog.

3177
01:21:37,110 --> 01:21:37,943
I swear to God,

3178
01:21:37,950 --> 01:21:38,521
I hear boom,

3179
01:21:38,521 --> 01:21:38,731
boom,

3180
01:21:38,731 --> 01:21:38,911
boom,

3181
01:21:38,911 --> 01:21:39,121
boom,

3182
01:21:39,121 --> 01:21:39,301
boom,

3183
01:21:39,301 --> 01:21:39,511
boom,

3184
01:21:39,511 --> 01:21:39,691
boom,

3185
01:21:39,691 --> 01:21:40,260
boom.

3186
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:41,100
I just passed out.

3187
01:21:41,101 --> 01:21:41,934
I'm on the bed.

3188
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:43,980
I must have jerked myself off to sleep,

3189
01:21:43,981 --> 01:21:44,640
whatever,

3190
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:45,390
cause I went back.

3191
01:21:45,390 --> 01:21:46,200
She was in the other bed.

3192
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:47,210
That's how coked up I was.

3193
01:21:47,211 --> 01:21:48,330
It was a naked lady.

3194
01:21:48,690 --> 01:21:50,010
But how it's checking off.

3195
01:21:50,011 --> 01:21:52,020
That's the disease and the pills.

3196
01:21:52,021 --> 01:21:53,400
I couldn't even wake her up no more.

3197
01:21:53,401 --> 01:21:53,701
She's like,

3198
01:21:53,701 --> 01:21:54,481
you're not going to get it hard.

3199
01:21:54,481 --> 01:21:55,314
Don't wake me up.

3200
01:21:55,690 --> 01:21:56,630
Pick was flat.

3201
01:21:56,631 --> 01:21:58,920
It had scratches from me
trying to whack it off.

3202
01:21:59,220 --> 01:22:00,150
It was all small.

3203
01:22:00,151 --> 01:22:02,640
Only the helmet comes out and
you've got to start from scratch.

3204
01:22:02,790 --> 01:22:05,100
So all you're whacking off at
first and they got to work at work,

3205
01:22:05,101 --> 01:22:07,260
at work and all of a sudden it just dies.

3206
01:22:07,350 --> 01:22:08,950
You think of your uncle playing bass.

3207
01:22:10,410 --> 01:22:12,120
So now Joe Rogan,

3208
01:22:12,121 --> 01:22:12,960
this was horrible.

3209
01:22:13,050 --> 01:22:13,621
I hit boom,

3210
01:22:13,621 --> 01:22:13,770
boom,

3211
01:22:13,770 --> 01:22:13,980
boom,

3212
01:22:13,980 --> 01:22:14,191
boom,

3213
01:22:14,191 --> 01:22:14,401
boom,

3214
01:22:14,401 --> 01:22:14,591
boom,

3215
01:22:14,591 --> 01:22:14,811
boom,

3216
01:22:14,811 --> 01:22:15,390
boom.

3217
01:22:15,390 --> 01:22:16,620
But like the feds or something,

3218
01:22:16,621 --> 01:22:17,490
I opened up my eyes.

3219
01:22:17,491 --> 01:22:18,121
I looked at the clock.

3220
01:22:18,121 --> 01:22:18,954
It's one o'clock.

3221
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:21,840
The kid came at seven to pick me up.

3222
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:22,860
I didn't pick up the phone.

3223
01:22:22,861 --> 01:22:23,371
They knocked.

3224
01:22:23,371 --> 01:22:24,204
I didn't hear it.

3225
01:22:24,330 --> 01:22:25,650
I guess the CIC Wold Cup left.

3226
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:26,340
I woke up,

3227
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:27,420
it was the hotel managers,

3228
01:22:27,421 --> 01:22:28,470
are you staying another night?

3229
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:29,520
And I'm like,

3230
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:30,170
yeah.

3231
01:22:30,170 --> 01:22:30,741
And he goes on,

3232
01:22:30,741 --> 01:22:33,480
he payment and I just went in my
pocket game like a hundred dollar bill.

3233
01:22:33,890 --> 01:22:34,890
It would keep the change.

3234
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:36,300
I went right back to sleep.

3235
01:22:36,810 --> 01:22:39,930
I woke up the next month
I slept straight 24 hours.

3236
01:22:39,931 --> 01:22:43,290
They slept straight through
a Monday morning at eight
I called my friend who was

3237
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:46,260
an attorney to come to [inaudible]
pick me up and he goes,

3238
01:22:46,261 --> 01:22:47,220
you're going to make your flight?

3239
01:22:47,370 --> 01:22:47,880
No,

3240
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:49,320
I didn't even call southwest.

3241
01:22:49,410 --> 01:22:50,790
I haven't had to buy another plane ticket.

3242
01:22:51,510 --> 01:22:52,320
So I just said,

3243
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:53,460
I drove with him.

3244
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:55,170
I went and got a big Mexican meal.

3245
01:22:55,230 --> 01:22:56,280
I was dehydrated,

3246
01:22:56,281 --> 01:22:57,114
everything.

3247
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:59,760
And I went and got another big
Mexican meal and then he goes,

3248
01:22:59,761 --> 01:23:00,271
what do you want to do?

3249
01:23:00,271 --> 01:23:00,991
You want to go to my house?

3250
01:23:00,991 --> 01:23:01,291
And I said,

3251
01:23:01,291 --> 01:23:02,124
no,

3252
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:03,390
take me to the intercontinental.

3253
01:23:03,390 --> 01:23:07,130
Pete had a deal over there for like
60 night before Philippe fucks it up.

3254
01:23:07,630 --> 01:23:09,310
So I stayed in there for three days.

3255
01:23:09,410 --> 01:23:10,260
We pay fuck it up.

3256
01:23:10,330 --> 01:23:11,560
He got fucked up with a chicken,

3257
01:23:11,561 --> 01:23:12,540
had a dick in her pussy,

3258
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:13,660
the best states.

3259
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:15,300
She had a pussy and they're still calling.

3260
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:16,700
Her name is Nikki.

3261
01:23:16,701 --> 01:23:19,090
He kept calling the tricky cause
she got a dick in her pussy.

3262
01:23:19,091 --> 01:23:19,451
But anyway,

3263
01:23:19,451 --> 01:23:21,680
back to the situation I got to,

3264
01:23:21,690 --> 01:23:24,970
I told tell went Monday
I lived off room service,

3265
01:23:24,971 --> 01:23:29,500
the money I made and Beaumont had a call
Terry to send me like the credit card

3266
01:23:29,501 --> 01:23:30,190
number.

3267
01:23:30,190 --> 01:23:33,220
I had eaten it because all
I could do is eat to refuel.

3268
01:23:33,790 --> 01:23:35,140
I couldn't even talk to nobody.

3269
01:23:35,141 --> 01:23:36,250
My agents were calling me,

3270
01:23:36,251 --> 01:23:37,060
where are you?

3271
01:23:37,060 --> 01:23:37,893
They want to say it.

3272
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:39,760
I would call people and I couldn't.

3273
01:23:39,870 --> 01:23:41,860
This side of my face wasn't moving though.

3274
01:23:43,470 --> 01:23:44,303
Like

3275
01:23:45,470 --> 01:23:48,700
I was proud of to like when you know when
you go to the dentist and your face is

3276
01:23:48,701 --> 01:23:49,000
dead.

3277
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,290
That's how bad I was.

3278
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:52,450
I didn't make it out of fucking Houston.

3279
01:23:52,451 --> 01:23:56,830
Felt Thursday took me five days and that's
the last time I basically had a pill.

3280
01:23:56,860 --> 01:23:59,290
That's why after that I knew
something had to be done.

3281
01:23:59,540 --> 01:24:00,730
Matt has had to be taken.

3282
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:01,211
I got a book.

3283
01:24:01,211 --> 01:24:02,044
He outta here.

3284
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:02,840
Get outta here.

3285
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:04,460
Powerful I mad flavor.

3286
01:24:04,490 --> 01:24:04,881
Listen,

3287
01:24:04,881 --> 01:24:09,881
there's a dude who's got your name is
Joel on Twitter so you don't have mad

3288
01:24:10,671 --> 01:24:11,200
flavor.

3289
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:12,260
You don't have Joey Diaz.

3290
01:24:12,270 --> 01:24:13,300
He gotta get Joey Diaz.

3291
01:24:13,310 --> 01:24:14,720
We need to figure out how to get that.

3292
01:24:14,930 --> 01:24:16,400
If anybody knows how to do that,

3293
01:24:16,460 --> 01:24:17,360
contact me.

3294
01:24:17,540 --> 01:24:21,410
It's ridiculous that some dude named Joel
is running around out there with Joey

3295
01:24:21,410 --> 01:24:21,411
Diaz.

3296
01:24:21,411 --> 01:24:22,100
His name.

3297
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:24,770
We need to have Joey Diaz
be Joey Diaz on Twitter.

3298
01:24:24,771 --> 01:24:25,480
Mad flavors too.

3299
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:26,510
Goddamn obscure.

3300
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:28,280
It's confusing the fuck out of people,

3301
01:24:28,610 --> 01:24:29,030
right?

3302
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:30,260
Am I right Brian?

3303
01:24:30,710 --> 01:24:33,200
I think joy days would be
definitely better but better,

3304
01:24:33,201 --> 01:24:33,440
right?

3305
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:34,250
I like mad flavor.

3306
01:24:34,250 --> 01:24:35,090
I love mad flavor.

3307
01:24:35,540 --> 01:24:36,141
Planet Rock.

3308
01:24:36,141 --> 01:24:38,480
Even Joey Planet Rock Diaz.

3309
01:24:38,481 --> 01:24:39,710
I was never when you were
applying planet rock,

3310
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:40,120
bro.

3311
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:41,090
I'm still planning rock.

3312
01:24:41,750 --> 01:24:43,190
Whatever the mind frame your brother.

3313
01:24:43,220 --> 01:24:44,053
Great to see you.

3314
01:24:44,860 --> 01:24:45,693
I love you man.

3315
01:24:45,890 --> 01:24:47,660
Love you to death that I
wanted to come up here.

3316
01:24:47,660 --> 01:24:49,810
I haven't had an intimate one in a while,

3317
01:24:49,820 --> 01:24:53,030
but two more weeks and we'll come up
and do one to five and really get down.

3318
01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:53,450
Yeah,

3319
01:24:53,450 --> 01:24:54,283
let's get down.

3320
01:24:54,530 --> 01:24:58,640
Argue with talking about the
Martians talking about stressing,

3321
01:24:59,030 --> 01:24:59,863
stressing.

3322
01:25:00,050 --> 01:25:00,351
All right,

3323
01:25:00,351 --> 01:25:01,310
we'll still send me,

3324
01:25:01,311 --> 01:25:02,720
I love you guys by the way.

3325
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:05,540
I love the guys that still
come to me and they stay.

3326
01:25:05,541 --> 01:25:08,240
I went to this restaurant and I
asked her and she didn't have it,

3327
01:25:08,241 --> 01:25:09,950
so we left and they take
a picture of the menu.

3328
01:25:10,430 --> 01:25:11,580
People actually to go.

3329
01:25:11,581 --> 01:25:13,650
Thank you very much for all
the love you give me back.

3330
01:25:13,790 --> 01:25:14,510
Love you motherfucker.

3331
01:25:14,510 --> 01:25:17,810
Thanks to whoever the fuck that sculptor
is that made the sculpture of the

3332
01:25:17,811 --> 01:25:18,291
Werewolf.

3333
01:25:18,291 --> 01:25:19,970
Fucking the gorilla in the ass.

3334
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:21,770
Whoever you are out there,

3335
01:25:21,830 --> 01:25:22,730
mass man,

3336
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,290
he did a fucking amazing job.

3337
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:25,550
I think it's wicked.

3338
01:25:25,650 --> 01:25:27,050
It'll be up in the new studio.

3339
01:25:27,350 --> 01:25:28,070

I see your Madison tomorrow.

3357
01:25:47,770 --> 01:25:49,220
We'll see you tonight at the Ice House.

3358
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:50,510
So he's going to be here tonight.

Greg Fitzsimmons.

3363
01:25:54,291 --> 01:25:56,060
Ari should fear Brian Red band.

3364
01:25:56,240 --> 01:25:57,170
It's going to be stacked.

3365

All right.

3369
01:26:02,450 --> 01:26:03,870
Sigora had to last minute

3370
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:04,690
and shift.

3371
01:26:04,690 --> 01:26:06,030
