1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,470
Didn't two,
one,

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,370
boom,
and we're live.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,950
Let's go.
Let's go chat.

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,330
If you said anything else other than 
let's go champions.

5
00:00:10,331 --> 00:00:12,330
The first thing you said in the podcast 
will be a giant.

6
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:14,760
We had to start it off,
right?

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,900
The chat.
Shannon,

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,900
how did you get started doing this man?
That is the you would you would think 

9
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,010
that that something like as simple as 
let's go champ,

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,350
like that wouldn't catch on.
How would that be?

11
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:31,710
So inspirational videos every day.
I get pumped up.

12
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:32,910
Thank you brother.
Thank you.

13
00:00:32,911 --> 00:00:34,590
I appreciate it.
A pleasure meeting you.

14
00:00:34,591 --> 00:00:36,430
Find on youtube as well,
champ.

15
00:00:36,431 --> 00:00:37,980
Let's go champ.
I appreciate this.

16
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:38,910
Oh,
I made it.

17
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,940
I'm here with you.
Your videos on instagram get me fired 

18
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,180
up.
They're positive.

19
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,590
They're exciting.
They're fun.

20
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,000
Infectious,
real.

21
00:00:48,001 --> 00:00:49,190
It's real.
It's real.

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,250
It's real me.
It's me.

23
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,550
I've been a fan of yours as a boxer for 
a long time,

24
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:58,530
but I love how you kind of reinvented 
yourself over the last few years.

25
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,880
You know what I mean?
Like you,

26
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,030
like you reinvented yourself with social
media.

27
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,340
Is this something you've always been 
doing privately?

28
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,910
You've been talking like this privately,

29
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,240
a hundred percent,
like,

30
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,040
you know,
you know,

31
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,070
honestly,
like this is the first time in my life.

32
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:20,340
I'm 44,
I'll be 45 in December fourth and a few 

33
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:20,340
weeks.
This is the first time I like honestly,

34
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,880
that I've,
I'm really being myself.

35
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:25,750
I'm,
I'm not putting on a show for anybody.

36
00:01:25,751 --> 00:01:28,090
I'm just showing my real personality,
which I'm silly.

37
00:01:28,091 --> 00:01:30,160
I'm goofy.
I'm sure he said times.

38
00:01:30,161 --> 00:01:32,260
I'm political at times.
I'm a family man.

39
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,610
I'm diverse,
you know,

40
00:01:33,611 --> 00:01:36,760
I love hip hop,
but I don't like listen to rap lyrics.

41
00:01:36,761 --> 00:01:39,450
So I just listened to beats.
So this is who I am and with the,

42
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,170
you know,
with uh,

43
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:46,230
with thanks to social media,
I'm able to just show it to the world 

44
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,230
and,
and that's.

45
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,230
And,
and I let my guard down.

46
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,480
I did.
To be honest with you,

47
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:49,210
I'm finally being like,
I'm not trying to be a tough guy because

48
00:01:49,211 --> 00:01:50,890
I'm a boxer.
I'm just being who I am.

49
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,070
Well,
it's fun,

50
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:52,600
man.
You know,

51
00:01:52,601 --> 00:01:56,930
you could tell because there's no other 
forum where you would just have a camera

52
00:01:56,931 --> 00:02:01,931
pointed at you.
He just sing mixing smoothies and 

53
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,200
talking about organic blueberries.
All the healthy shit you eat.

54
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,030
It's very exciting,
man.

55
00:02:08,031 --> 00:02:10,670
I mean like you'll,
you'll do a video just telling people to

56
00:02:10,671 --> 00:02:12,290
drink water.
And it's true like,

57
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:13,040
fuck man,
I'm gonna.

58
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,030
Drink some water.

59
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,410
Seriously,
you gotta stay hydrated.

60
00:02:15,411 --> 00:02:16,020
Champion,
you know,

61
00:02:16,021 --> 00:02:17,540
um,
I listen to you as well.

62
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,690
You have a war on sugar,
more sugar and I been out.

63
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,950
I'm totally for that because,
um,

64
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,580
it destroys you,
man.

65
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,770
Destroys every level mentally,
physically.

66
00:02:27,771 --> 00:02:30,280
It just takes away from me.
So I try to step on toes,

67
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:35,770
you know,
eating right and changing my diet 

68
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:35,770
changed my life.
I was finished.

69
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:36,770
I was like,
God,

70
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,440
I was a 403 pounds.
I was out of boxing.

71
00:02:39,441 --> 00:02:43,220
I was financially ruined and I'm eating 
my,

72
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,770
changing my diet just totally made my 
life different.

73
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:46,490
Well,

74
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,960
I love your story because I,
I love a guy who I love a success story,

75
00:02:50,961 --> 00:02:55,961
but almost more than a success story.
I love a success than fuck your life up 

76
00:02:56,171 --> 00:03:00,070
and get it back together again.
So I liked that because there's like

77
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:05,070
a,
there's a certain amount of enthusiasm 

78
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:05,070
that you have that you,
you,

79
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,490
you know,
that you've seen dark days,

80
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,470
but now you're back,
you know,

81
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:11,440
and that's part of like the fun of what 
you're doing,

82
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,410
you know what I mean?
Thank you.

83
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,220
Thank you.
The sugar thing is a fucked up thing,

84
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:15,850
isn't it?
Like,

85
00:03:15,851 --> 00:03:18,310
totally because most people don't know.
That's what screwed me up.

86
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:23,311
I told you I was like,
everyday Donald's and this is after 

87
00:03:23,311 --> 00:03:25,180
years of eating right and just letting 
myself go.

88
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:26,500
And that's a whole nother story.
But,

89
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:28,660
um,
I just fell into a deep depression.

90
00:03:28,661 --> 00:03:33,661
I was just eating junk food all the time
and crispy cream and sugar was just part

91
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:35,920
of my diet and it was making me crazy 
mentally.

92
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:40,921
I was in cell phone from depression.
I wanted to off myself for over two 

93
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:41,500
years.
I was committing suicide champ.

94
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,970
I was just like,
to the point,

95
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,000
I didn't have a clue what to do,
you know,

96
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,160
um,
although financially I was doing well,

97
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,350
I had got out of box and I had got the 
job and,

98
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:54,690
but I was just,
I had seen so much darkness in my life 

99
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:55,610
from,
from a child and um,

100
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,460
it just,
it was overwhelming because what I did,

101
00:03:57,461 --> 00:04:00,370
Joe was throughout my life,
I would store things and put them in the

102
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:01,000
closet,
you know,

103
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:02,740
I was told very young that,
you know,

104
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:04,060
you got to be the man of the house,
you know,

105
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:04,630
so,
um,

106
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:10,410
you gotta get over it.
So you're doing that when you're 11 

107
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:10,410
years old,
12 years old,

108
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,120
eight years old.
That becomes your over over time.

109
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:14,090
I just,
you know,

110
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,890
snapped.
It's too much pressure.

111
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,050
There was just too much pressure.
And then,

112
00:04:17,051 --> 00:04:17,370
you know,
I'm,

113
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:22,610
I'm a kid,
honestly fighting guys like George 

114
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:23,050
Foreman and Lennox Lewis with very 
little amateur experience.

115
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,700
This was all happening fast.
So it just became at a point,

116
00:04:26,701 --> 00:04:28,160
you know,
I got older that was just like,

117
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:28,810
hold on me.
Well,

118
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:30,490
when you were young,
you were so hyped up,

119
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,520
you know,
you had this crazy look with the 

120
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,321
dreadlocks and Teddy Atlas is behind you
and all these big names and everybody's 

121
00:04:37,321 --> 00:04:39,550
like Shannon cannon,
brexit's an expat thing and you know,

122
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,700
you had a lot of success,
but there was some people that felt like

123
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:47,701
you didn't live up to your full 
potential and then you went away for a 

124
00:04:47,701 --> 00:04:49,720
little bit and then you came back and 
you look better than ever.

125
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,950
This is like,
this is like my third combat,

126
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,020
maybe fourth,
to be honest with you.

127
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:01,050
This is like my fourth coming back,
so because I've always had like a foot 

128
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,350
and boxing,
but it was nothing really.

129
00:05:02,351 --> 00:05:06,670
Something that I was really dedicated to
or had the right team behind me.

130
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,130
It was always something that was to get,
you know,

131
00:05:09,131 --> 00:05:14,131
to get me by to make a living.
And it's finally come to the point now 

132
00:05:14,131 --> 00:05:14,260
at 44,
[inaudible] 45.

133
00:05:14,261 --> 00:05:19,261
I think about three,
four years ago when I got to the point 

134
00:05:19,261 --> 00:05:19,261
where it's like,
you know what?

135
00:05:19,261 --> 00:05:19,810
I know I'm good at this.
This is something that I've,

136
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:24,860
I've,
this is a talent that I've had because 

137
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:24,860
I've had one foot in and one foot out 
and I've done great.

138
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,420
You know,
they say you can't cheat boxing.

139
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,690
I won the heavyweight title twice,
you know what I'm saying?

140
00:05:27,691 --> 00:05:29,260
Not that I cheated boxing,
but I never,

141
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:34,210
I never had the stability and the deep 
I'm backing,

142
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:34,760
we're,
I had,

143
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,910
I had a team behind me,
don't get me wrong financially,

144
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:42,090
but I don't.
I wouldn't say they were for my best 

145
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:42,130
interest in that sense.
Whereas it was a marketing,

146
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:42,880
you know,
I could,

147
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:46,000
I could bring in big money from 
investors and stuff like that,

148
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,770
but then it got to the point I was like,
you know what,

149
00:05:47,771 --> 00:05:48,820
Shanda,
I'm better than that.

150
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,720
But I wasn't given the opportunity to 
have a real training situation.

151
00:05:52,721 --> 00:05:54,100
You know?
I was on my own for a long time.

152
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:59,220
I really been on my own.
If you look at it since like 1995 when 

153
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,621
me and teddy that was split.
I basically been on my own with 

154
00:06:02,621 --> 00:06:03,710
different trainers and different 
promoters and really no management,

155
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,270
just doing what I had to do to make a 
living.

156
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,270
When you look back on your career and 
you look back,

157
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,430
especially in the early days when there 
was so much hype behind human,

158
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,220
you are the next big thing out of 
Brownsville.

159
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:16,280
You're this guy that everybody was 
looking forward to that this is going to

160
00:06:16,281 --> 00:06:18,590
be the next big heavyweight.
How much is that?

161
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,410
Too much pressure in a sense.
In a lot of ways.

162
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,030
Do you almost like not train 100 percent
to give yourself some excuses?

163
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,170
Is that possible?

164
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:32,470
It's possible.
I guess for other people it wasn't for 

165
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:32,470
me.
What was going on for you back then?

166
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:36,671
Like what was that like to be that young
up and coming prospect with all those 

167
00:06:36,671 --> 00:06:38,680
eyes on them that wasn't really,
um,

168
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,720
it was overwhelming in a sense.
It was fun,

169
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:43,470
don't get me wrong,
but it was overwhelming in a sense where

170
00:06:43,471 --> 00:06:45,080
it's like,
I knew I wasn't ready.

171
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,590
I had a very limited amateur background 
from day one.

172
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:50,510
I was put on the top level.
I mean,

173
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:52,460
I had 10 amateur fights.
I was on the USA team.

174
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:57,780
I fought Felix who had 300 fights when I
had 18 amateur fights on ABC wide world 

175
00:06:58,131 --> 00:07:00,260
of sports.
This was a little overwhelming for me.

176
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:05,261
Not,
I mean 18 amateur fights and here I'm 

177
00:07:05,261 --> 00:07:05,261
fighting a guy,
you know,

178
00:07:05,261 --> 00:07:05,261
a gold medalist,
but you know,

179
00:07:05,261 --> 00:07:05,640
it happened.
So I get,

180
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:10,660
I kinda started out young knowing that 
you know what you're going to be on the 

181
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:10,660
big screen,
you're going to be out there,

182
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,480
although you're not prepared.

183
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,430
So you felt like you were always playing
catch up?

184
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,280
Always.
Oh,

185
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:17,090
until the last couple of years where I 
was home making videos,

186
00:07:17,091 --> 00:07:21,200
I had time to get in shape.
I hadn't had a drink in over five years.

187
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,360
I started drinking when I was 13 years 
old.

188
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,170
You know what I mean?
I was 13 years old.

189
00:07:25,171 --> 00:07:30,171
I was drinking.
I was homeless from when I was 13 to 

190
00:07:30,171 --> 00:07:30,171
about 20 years old.
Live in here,

191
00:07:30,171 --> 00:07:34,510
in here.
So I've been on my own since basically 

192
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:34,510
since I was a kid.
You know what I mean?

193
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,190
So when I was put on an,
on the image,

194
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,470
the top level,
I've always been in a situation where,

195
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,470
uh,
um,

196
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,580
besides playing catch up,
I'm on a Mac,

197
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:48,610
I'm on the big screen and I'm not ready,
but I got to do the best I can and I've 

198
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:51,050
always done that and that's what I try 
to tell people to do the best you can,

199
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:51,710
you know what I mean?

200
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,360
Do the best you can because you never 
know,

201
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:58,540
but that I'm not ready.
Thing seems to have been the constant 

202
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:58,540
theme.
Like that was always in the back of your

203
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:58,600
head,
right?

204
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,980
100 percent.
And that was that.

205
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,390
That's confidence.
That's what confidence is.

206
00:08:02,391 --> 00:08:05,490
If you go into any fight saying to him,
I'm already,

207
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:10,130
you already have to feed it.
And I was so talented that I could still

208
00:08:10,131 --> 00:08:11,330
overcome.
You know,

209
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,150
I fought George Foreman grill basically 
on my own.

210
00:08:14,151 --> 00:08:16,580
I wasn't with Daddy.
We had split up.

211
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,680
I met a guy down in,
not a guy,

212
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:22,700
a friend of mines now and call us up and
we trained for about eight weeks.

213
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:25,970
And He,
I was battling George George Foreman and

214
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:27,620
got a close decision,
but,

215
00:08:27,621 --> 00:08:28,000
um,
he,

216
00:08:28,001 --> 00:08:30,200
I was,
I didn't get knocked out and I was happy

217
00:08:30,201 --> 00:08:30,820
with that,
you know,

218
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,510
and I became the linear heavyweight 
champion.

219
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,170
I was like,
wow,

220
00:08:33,171 --> 00:08:38,171
you know,
there was a light to beat George 

221
00:08:38,171 --> 00:08:38,171
Foreman.
Unimaginable.

222
00:08:38,171 --> 00:08:40,880
There's a mount rushmore of boxing.
It comes to the heavyweight division for

223
00:08:40,881 --> 00:08:42,230
short.
George Foreman's on it.

224
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:42,660
Yeah.
Yeah,

225
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,150
definitely,
definitely.

226
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,920
Great Guy.
Great Guy.

227
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,590
It must have been a trip to just be 
looking at them on the other side of the

228
00:08:48,591 --> 00:08:49,160
ring.
Yeah,

229
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,110
it was,
you know,

230
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,320
again,
I wasn't ready,

231
00:08:51,321 --> 00:08:52,560
but I was there,
you know,

232
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,720
it wasn't ready.
Um,

233
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,380
confidence wise,
you know,

234
00:08:55,381 --> 00:08:56,820
I just met the trainer.
We,

235
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:57,870
you know,
got through to him.

236
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:02,871
He spoke no English at all.
He would tell me is give me a jump rope 

237
00:09:02,871 --> 00:09:03,000
and say jump.
I jumped rope,

238
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:05,040
you know what I mean?
He spoke no English,

239
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:05,960
very hard.
Spoke,

240
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,470
spoke very little English.
And um,

241
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,700
I speak very little Spanish but 
understood working.

242
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,990
We just worked and I want the title.
Wow.

243
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,300
Yeah.
It was now almost copy on Vamos can't be

244
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,610
all pretty much living in Miami,
you know,

245
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,720
when you,
you split with Teddy Atlas,

246
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:26,770
that was a big deal too because teddy 
atlas is a notorious hard ass now.

247
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,530
I mean he's the hardest of the hard.
I mean even when you look at them,

248
00:09:29,531 --> 00:09:31,760
that big scar across his face and you 
know,

249
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:35,050
he talks very brutally and he was,
he was like open publicly,

250
00:09:35,051 --> 00:09:37,330
like saying that he just didn't think 
that you were all in.

251
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,770
That was,
that was,

252
00:09:38,771 --> 00:09:43,771
uh,
that was a real down point in my life 

253
00:09:43,771 --> 00:09:46,801
where I really felt like that was one of
the Times where suicide definitely came 

254
00:09:46,931 --> 00:09:48,880
into play.
And I know that may sound crazy,

255
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:51,220
but the reason why is because,
you know,

256
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,900
when I got with Teddy,
I was like 19,

257
00:09:52,901 --> 00:09:56,800
20 years old and he was very over 
bearing in that sense where it's like,

258
00:09:56,801 --> 00:09:58,240
you know,
I want to,

259
00:09:58,241 --> 00:09:59,230
I wanted to make it,
you know,

260
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:01,600
I was homeless,
I wanted to make and I was willing to do

261
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:05,320
anything he said or without,
with the management said to make it.

262
00:10:05,321 --> 00:10:07,150
Because it was either that or die in 
prison.

263
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:10,000
My Dad was in prison at the time where 
he eventually died.

264
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,880
My mom was on drugs.
She was on heroin and crack.

265
00:10:12,881 --> 00:10:13,990
So it was like,
okay,

266
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:17,010
I got a manager now and I had an 
opportunity to a trainer,

267
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:17,980
Teddy Alice.

268
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:22,030
We used to train my Mike Tyson.
So I gave myself to him in a sense where

269
00:10:22,031 --> 00:10:27,031
I was like,
everything he says I'm going to do and 

270
00:10:27,031 --> 00:10:27,031
in doing so,
um,

271
00:10:27,031 --> 00:10:31,290
I felt like when we split and he 
wouldn't publicly and said that about 

272
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:34,591
me,
it hurts so bad because I looked at him 

273
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:35,950
like a father figure because Cedi spent 
many days I think,

274
00:10:35,951 --> 00:10:40,951
you know,
tearing me down so he could control and 

275
00:10:40,951 --> 00:10:40,951
you know,
my mind and that was cool,

276
00:10:40,951 --> 00:10:40,951
you know,
whatever.

277
00:10:40,951 --> 00:10:43,450
I knew I didn't come to him as a kid.
I kept him as a 19,

278
00:10:43,451 --> 00:10:47,050
20 year old.
So when we split and he went publicly,

279
00:10:47,051 --> 00:10:48,490
I was just at a down point.
Everyone,

280
00:10:48,491 --> 00:10:50,250
I was undefeated.
I lost for HBO,

281
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,240
neither the heavyweights,
it was a big,

282
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:52,750
uh,
you know,

283
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,960
montage about me and everything.
And here I was,

284
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,590
the head of the show and I got knocked 
out by Darren Wilson at the,

285
00:10:57,591 --> 00:11:00,700
around and when teddy went out I was 
just like,

286
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:01,360
damn,
you know,

287
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:03,660
what happened to the days when it was 
like me and you were like,

288
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,260
you know,
we,

289
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:05,740
I was with them for three,
four,

290
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,060
five years from what I'm saying.

291
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:12,540
It was so much a mental telling me that,
you know,

292
00:11:13,181 --> 00:11:15,760
without me,
you're nothing and you don't have this,

293
00:11:15,761 --> 00:11:17,380
you don't have that.
But then fight time,

294
00:11:17,381 --> 00:11:19,150
you can do it.
So such a mental,

295
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:21,910
you know,
pumping puppet type of thing.

296
00:11:21,911 --> 00:11:24,130
When we split,
I contemplated committed suicide.

297
00:11:24,131 --> 00:11:26,570
I was in my management's basement.
I had a shotgun.

298
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,220
I was like,
man,

299
00:11:27,221 --> 00:11:30,340
you know,
because I mean I was just in a bad place

300
00:11:30,341 --> 00:11:32,140
and everyone turned it,
turned it back on me.

301
00:11:32,141 --> 00:11:37,141
I mean,
the newspapers rip me apart in his 

302
00:11:37,141 --> 00:11:38,320
intelligence influence.
Teddy's influenced with the writers.

303
00:11:38,321 --> 00:11:40,850
And you know,
the New York City cried was such,

304
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,800
so,
so strong.

305
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,350
He had built a great relationship with,
um,

306
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:48,990
I don't want to put anybody out there,
but he had built great relationships 

307
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:48,990
with a certain certain writers and um,
they just,

308
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,710
everybody's assaulted me.
I was just crazy.

309
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:54,430
It was one born on Shannon break.
So I survived

310
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,160
that though.
So that was part of me saying,

311
00:11:56,161 --> 00:12:01,161
that's why I tell people I'm the champ 
because I've never spoken about this 

312
00:12:01,161 --> 00:12:01,161
publicly.
This is my first time.

313
00:12:01,161 --> 00:12:02,500
Let's go champ.
Let's go champ.

314
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:03,250
You know,
but uh,

315
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,800
probably hit emotion in my voice,
but I apologize.

316
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,310
But,
you know,

317
00:12:06,311 --> 00:12:07,420
the whole thing is like,
um,

318
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:13,170
that was,
that was part of the reason why I call 

319
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:13,170
myself the champion.
I mean,

320
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:13,990
because although when I beat for him in,
you know,

321
00:12:13,991 --> 00:12:14,590
people say,
Oh,

322
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:19,650
you really lost and nothing.
That third eye I wanted the title that 

323
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:23,251
wasn't winning.
Winning was doing that with my mom had 

324
00:12:23,251 --> 00:12:23,251
just died on my birthday,
you know,

325
00:12:23,251 --> 00:12:24,810
that was to me why I'm the champ,
you know,

326
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,460
because I went out there with,
you know,

327
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,720
without a stable stability,
stable trainer.

328
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,240
And I still fought and went 12 rounds.
That's why I'm the champ.

329
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,870
Then,
uh,

330
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:37,890
you know,
those type of moments in my life is yc 

331
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,340
and the chain went under title again 
with one second left on the clock would 

332
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:40,390
lie Covich.
Um,

333
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,890
that's not why I'm the champ.
No,

334
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,340
because I fought that fight with an 
asthma attack and I was born asthmatic.

335
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:48,520
I meet the fact that I'm even.
Boxing is unreal.

336
00:12:48,521 --> 00:12:50,460
You know,
I spent my childhood in the hospitals.

337
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,870
I got to,
I hardly got an education.

338
00:12:52,871 --> 00:12:54,190
I dropped out of high school in ninth 
grade.

339
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:55,150
Joe.
So,

340
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,670
you know,
I never part of my school,

341
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:02,790
they used to go on trips,
was to come visit me in school because 

342
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:02,790
of my asthma,
you know what I mean?

343
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,850
So for me to become a heavyweight 
champion of the world,

344
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
to Tom's about to be three very soon.
This is an accomplishment for not only 

345
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,111
myself but for asthmatic and people who 
didn't give up because I wanted to give 

346
00:13:13,111 --> 00:13:13,111
up.
When Teddy left me,

347
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:14,650
I want them to give up champ.

348
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,220
Well,
people don't know boxing,

349
00:13:16,221 --> 00:13:19,070
maybe don't know the legend of Teddy 
Atlas and him,

350
00:13:19,071 --> 00:13:24,071
how he directly connects the customer on
the early days of the Tyson camp and you

351
00:13:25,831 --> 00:13:26,640
know,
Teddy's a,

352
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,960
he's like a famous motivator,
I would say,

353
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,010
you know,
in a lot of ways,

354
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:36,011
but I think there's a certain amount of 
intoxication that comes from people 

355
00:13:36,011 --> 00:13:39,581
telling you you're a great motivator and
you start to believe it and buy it and 

356
00:13:39,581 --> 00:13:40,430
do it yourself.
You may remember the Tim Bradley fight,

357
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,140
boys in timberly's caught.
He's like,

358
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,090
we're firemen.
We fight,

359
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,750
they fight the fire.

360
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,180
I love Teddy.
Listen man.

361
00:13:49,181 --> 00:13:50,040
You know,
it's,

362
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,510
it's hard for me and I,
you know,

363
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:56,520
it's hard for me to talk about this now 
because this is before the fame for 

364
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:56,520
teddy,
right?

365
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:01,290
Like when we met Teddy,
I think he was working in a liquor 

366
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:01,290
store.
I'm not sure,

367
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:01,990
no disrespect,
but you know,

368
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:06,991
that's just the facts and he wasn't 
doing well financially and my manager 

369
00:14:06,991 --> 00:14:11,041
was like,
you know what I spoke about earlier 

370
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:12,751
about he was a guy can go out and raise 
capital and he had this young kid from 

371
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:15,340
the same neighborhood is Mike Tyson.
I had just won the national,

372
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:19,210
excuse me,
the US championships in 92 and 91,

373
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:22,560
92 and he was able to go out and get in 
gods.

374
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,470
He looked back,
my guy,

375
00:14:23,471 --> 00:14:24,260
you know,
like race horse,

376
00:14:24,261 --> 00:14:29,261
you don't just keep it real.
And he got this famous trainer to train 

377
00:14:29,261 --> 00:14:30,580
his own race horse was Teddy Alice and I
was,

378
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,720
I submitted.
I was like,

379
00:14:31,721 --> 00:14:32,150
Hey,
whatever.

380
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,810
I was listening,
it was this or jail.

381
00:14:34,811 --> 00:14:37,300
I,
I said dad was in prison and my step dad

382
00:14:37,301 --> 00:14:42,301
was in prison,
was in the streets and the manager was 

383
00:14:42,301 --> 00:14:42,301
like,
Hey,

384
00:14:42,301 --> 00:14:43,480
you know what sign would be?
I gonna put your mom in Rehab.

385
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,820
And I was like,
hell yeah.

386
00:14:45,821 --> 00:14:50,821
Okay.
He did everything he said he was gonna 

387
00:14:50,821 --> 00:14:52,381
do and he gave.
He believes in teddy and I believed in 

388
00:14:52,381 --> 00:14:52,381
and teddy

389
00:14:52,381 --> 00:14:57,100
and the process I watched him say,
he told me I would never be a 

390
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,140
commentator because he doesn't feel is 
right to talk about fighters.

391
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,830
This is what he told me.
He said he would never be a common ever,

392
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,180
but he,
of course he is a commentator.

393
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:10,210
This was before he became,
so he decided to become on a lot of 

394
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:10,210
things,
a lot of things that were said.

395
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:15,820
Um,
basically when we split and he went on 

396
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,820
television,
New York one and said,

397
00:15:16,821 --> 00:15:17,450
hey,
you know,

398
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,760
he didn't think I had this in the third.
I was like,

399
00:15:19,761 --> 00:15:24,761
damn,
what will all the times that we were 

400
00:15:24,761 --> 00:15:24,761
winning,
it was weak when I lost that one time it

401
00:15:24,761 --> 00:15:25,310
was me.
So,

402
00:15:25,311 --> 00:15:26,120
you know,
I just,

403
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:31,170
you know,
there's not an exact science to 

404
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:31,170
motivating people,
right?

405
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:34,091
There's not an exact science of training
and a lot of the relationship between a 

406
00:15:34,091 --> 00:15:37,001
trainer and a fighter comes to like a 
perfect trainer for you might not be a 

407
00:15:37,001 --> 00:15:37,001
perfect trainer for another guy.

408
00:15:37,001 --> 00:15:41,090
It's just you gotta have that bond 
together and whether you do your don't,

409
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,490
you don't find out until you're in there
right now.

410
00:15:43,491 --> 00:15:48,491
Looking back as a man now as an 
accomplished man and you look back on 

411
00:15:48,491 --> 00:15:52,601
your days when you were 19 or 20,
what do you think would have been 

412
00:15:52,601 --> 00:15:55,691
different?
Like what would you have done to 

413
00:15:55,691 --> 00:15:55,691
motivate yourself or to talk to yourself
differently back then?

414
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:58,190
You know what I'm doing now?
To be honest with you,

415
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,230
I honestly tell you joe,
like what I'm doing right now,

416
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,230
being free.
You know,

417
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,770
everyone's not that type of fighter.
You know,

418
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,190
he worked great for I guess certain 
people.

419
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:08,920
I'm not that type of guy.
Look,

420
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,370
I'm a funny guy.
I like to have fun.

421
00:16:10,371 --> 00:16:11,840
I like to laugh.
I like the bug out,

422
00:16:11,841 --> 00:16:12,470
you know?
Um,

423
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,210
I like to live,
you know,

424
00:16:14,211 --> 00:16:15,440
I'm happy.
I'm a happy guy.

425
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:18,010
Teddy is not different in that way.
You know what I'm saying?

426
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,290
And for a long time I'm look looking.
For example,

427
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:26,350
Ali Ali trained to archery moy trend.
Another other is before he got the 

428
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,710
Dundee.
Dundee knew how to train our lead.

429
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,770
Let him do him and this is what I'm 
doing now.

430
00:16:30,771 --> 00:16:31,540
People will say,
you know,

431
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,100
my guys who worked with me,
Jesse Robertson,

432
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,530
Stacy Mckinley,
the great statesman,

433
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,920
Mckenzie,
the Great Jesse Robertson,

434
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:40,130
these guys know how to train me now and 
although I'm 44,

435
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:45,230
almost 45,
I've learned later on in life how to 

436
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:45,640
just be me be free.
This is,

437
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:46,970
this works for Shannon Briggs,
win,

438
00:16:46,971 --> 00:16:48,320
lose or draw.
It works for Shannon breeze.

439
00:16:48,321 --> 00:16:50,960
Opposed to being someone else because 
someone else said,

440
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:56,050
and I've done a lot of that.
In the end it became a syndrome where 

441
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:56,050
it's like,
you know,

442
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,750
I grew up,
I grew up in this with a manager,

443
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:03,760
with a trainer,
and an investor became like a process 

444
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:03,760
for me to go through it over and over 
and over again.

445
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,720
It's like to the point where like your 
man champ,

446
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:10,860
do you feel like all these people were 
trying to shape you and you were 

447
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,270
resisting it or you were confused by it?
I was going along with the program 

448
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:13,270
champ,
you know,

449
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:13,940
whatever,
you know,

450
00:17:13,941 --> 00:17:14,900
survival,
you know,

451
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:16,290
go on with the program.
The one,

452
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:19,250
the hardest thing for me and my life was
being homeless,

453
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:24,710
you know,
being a homeless teenager and losing my 

454
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:24,710
home because it wasn't like something 
that I was used to.

455
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:29,321
I came home from school one day I was 
going to pitch a block at school 

456
00:17:29,321 --> 00:17:32,471
whenever I came home and we were 
affected and I looked through the peep 

457
00:17:32,471 --> 00:17:33,670
hole and I looked in.
The apartment was empty and I was like,

458
00:17:33,671 --> 00:17:38,671
I lived here all my life.
I was born and raised in Atlantic 

459
00:17:38,671 --> 00:17:38,671
towers,
you know,

460
00:17:38,671 --> 00:17:39,100
so that was a turning point for me.
I,

461
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:41,540
I left home.
I left that building that day,

462
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:47,120
a homeless,
the homeless kid and no more comic 

463
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:47,420
books,
no more toys that I grew up,

464
00:17:47,421 --> 00:17:49,710
you know?
And then now the people who

465
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,680
look at me on the gram,
they see my personality,

466
00:17:52,681 --> 00:17:54,630
you know what I'm saying?
They see the comic book side of me.

467
00:17:54,631 --> 00:17:59,631
They see the television side of me.
Whereas I lost my childhood that day 

468
00:17:59,631 --> 00:18:03,650
when I went home and we were evicted.
That day became like I had to become a 

469
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:07,341
man that day.
I took the bus to my aunt's house and 

470
00:18:07,341 --> 00:18:11,420
you know,
that night she kicked us out so my life 

471
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,980
was no longer had a color TV in my room 
and you know,

472
00:18:13,981 --> 00:18:15,600
it was all about survival,
you know,

473
00:18:15,601 --> 00:18:18,570
I started getting in trouble and life 
took me to where I am now.

474
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:19,870
Wow.
And you were,

475
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:22,410
you were boxing at the time to na number
box.

476
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:24,240
You Start Boxing?
I started boxing.

477
00:18:24,241 --> 00:18:25,770
I was like 16,
17.

478
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,960
So you started boxing as you were 
homeless?

479
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:28,980
Yeah.
Wow.

480
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:34,820
And how are you doing now?
Like where were you sleeping in 

481
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:34,820
different places?
Sometimes the aunt's house,

482
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,720
a cousin's house or friend's house,
you know,

483
00:18:36,721 --> 00:18:38,740
sometimes the shelter,
uh,

484
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,950
wherever.
I could be honest with you.

485
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,440
And so it wasn't until you started 
having some success as a boxer that you 

486
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:46,440
stopped being homeless?

487
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,180
Yeah,
well actually I got an apartment,

488
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:48,790
my,
uh,

489
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,940
rest in peace.
Jimmy O'farrell my,

490
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:56,220
my savior,
he found these gems third city when I 

491
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:56,360
was about 16 years old.
And um,

492
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,350
I stopped there many nights too.
I was staying in the gym and that's what

493
00:18:59,351 --> 00:18:59,890
kind of.
Okay.

494
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:03,640
It was funny because boxing always drew 
me back in because,

495
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,080
you know,
I'm like,

496
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,670
I might get in trouble,
go to jail,

497
00:19:06,671 --> 00:19:11,671
get arrested in whatever as a teen and 
I'm from wanting to get out of trouble 

498
00:19:11,671 --> 00:19:11,740
and had to go to get Jimmy.
Oh,

499
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,590
to hopefully sign for me for probation 
or something like that.

500
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,990
And then I'd have to use the gym as my,
uh,

501
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,730
uh,
residents.

502
00:19:18,731 --> 00:19:19,730
I sleep in the chair,
man.

503
00:19:19,731 --> 00:19:24,731
It was freezing many nights,
but it's what I had to do until I was 

504
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:24,731
drawn back to boxing,
you know,

505
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:25,170
I wanted to be.

506
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,470
I always had the talent.
So,

507
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,090
you know,
like for instance,

508
00:19:28,091 --> 00:19:30,370
let me tell you this,
my first guy that ever looked,

509
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,040
gave me some money with shelly finkel.
Wow.

510
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,530
The first guy I was like 17 years old,
18 years old.

511
00:19:35,531 --> 00:19:37,380
He was looking for me.
He was calling around with Gemini,

512
00:19:37,381 --> 00:19:41,000
generally said that Kid's homeless.
It got back to me and he shall,

513
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:46,040
we think he was looking for me.
I couldn't believe it could show me 

514
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,040
think it was shelly.
Thank legendary boxing because after,

515
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,130
and I never forget.
I swear to God,

516
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,960
I went to senior,
I went to see him,

517
00:19:49,961 --> 00:19:53,380
Joe and he gave me five grand.
He was like,

518
00:19:53,381 --> 00:19:54,390
you're gonna make it.
He said,

519
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:55,270
I want,
you know,

520
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,230
seeing,
you know,

521
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:57,610
what my team or whatever.
I was like,

522
00:19:57,611 --> 00:20:01,470
I can't believe it and I leave this 
building I believe is built.

523
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,290
I go to the,
I'm going,

524
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,320
I'm in a train station.
Joe and I take out the money to get a 

525
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,171
token.
This is when they had the token booth 

526
00:20:10,171 --> 00:20:11,400
and it had to be like 89 90.
And uh,

527
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:14,680
God's seen me with the money.
I was homeless at the time.

528
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:17,380
I took trying.
I took out one of the hundreds.

529
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:20,500
He tried to rob me on the train.
He followed me.

530
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:24,400
I couldn't believe it.
I had never seen $5,000

531
00:20:24,401 --> 00:20:26,200
let alone I had it in my pocket.
Right.

532
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,800
And I'm thinking this right?
So he tries to rob you on the train pro.

533
00:20:29,801 --> 00:20:30,690
I beat the crap

534
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,080
bottom.
It was crazy.

535
00:20:34,081 --> 00:20:36,720
Jake the wrong dude.
Now when you,

536
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:41,780
when you went that long period of year 
of your life where you're boxing 

537
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,100
consistently and then you stopped for 
awhile,

538
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,470
what was going on there in your life?

539
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:49,630
Let me see.
How long did you stop for?

540
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,680
Just one year here.
Two years here.

541
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:53,770
Three years here.
I was not,

542
00:20:53,771 --> 00:20:55,570
I wasn't consistent.
I wasn't concerned.

543
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,300
I just like,
again,

544
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,610
man,
it goes back to the confidence,

545
00:20:57,611 --> 00:21:02,611
you know,
just never really had the confidence to 

546
00:21:02,611 --> 00:21:04,741
really want to do it a to just really 
feel like I had a foot of my foot,

547
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,710
my feet solid in the ground and they 
miss these last couple of years gave me.

548
00:21:08,711 --> 00:21:10,410
That gave me the opportunity to just,
you know,

549
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:13,010
train,
stop messing what I call it.

550
00:21:13,011 --> 00:21:18,011
Not that I'm making up for lost time,
but I called making up for lost time 

551
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:18,100
because I'm training everyday nonstop,
you know,

552
00:21:18,101 --> 00:21:23,101
I'll get my rest of course,
but I've dedicated my life for years to 

553
00:21:23,101 --> 00:21:26,191
this unit.
And what made you decide to just clean 

554
00:21:26,191 --> 00:21:26,191
everything up?
Eat healthy,

555
00:21:26,191 --> 00:21:26,770
stopped drinking.
Like what?

556
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:31,770
What was it like?
How did you make that decision to just 

557
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:32,230
stop and get it together?
I was suicidal.

558
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,120
I was like,
I had a daughter.

559
00:21:34,121 --> 00:21:35,830
I had my baby girl.
I have two sons.

560
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,180
Chan breads,
my boy.

561
00:21:37,181 --> 00:21:38,260
I love him with death.
Let's go.

562
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,960
Champ is 19.
My son Jaden breaks,

563
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,310
who's 10 years old.
I love them too.

564
00:21:42,311 --> 00:21:45,850
Let's go chat.
And my baby girl chloe and she's uh,

565
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,080
she was,
she changed everything.

566
00:21:47,081 --> 00:21:49,300
She's four now and it was four years 
ago.

567
00:21:49,301 --> 00:21:54,301
I got to everything that I always really
everything in four years for the four 

568
00:21:54,301 --> 00:21:54,301
years ago,
my life changed,

569
00:21:54,301 --> 00:21:56,050
you know,
she came and she was a spitting image of

570
00:21:56,051 --> 00:21:58,210
my mom and you know,
I was just like,

571
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,940
I was two when she came on,
I could see my mom and I let.

572
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:05,630
It was like my mom reincarnated.
I'm an only child and you know,

573
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,750
here was,
I was back with my mother again.

574
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,570
I could see it.
It was,

575
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:12,280
it was an area was a ghost.
And then I was fat.

576
00:22:12,281 --> 00:22:13,810
I was depressed and I was there 
everyday.

577
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:16,960
I sat on the couch where every dime for 
one year straight,

578
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,300
like 364 days,
I kid you not.

579
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,340
I Sat,
my wife would get in the morning.

580
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:21,880
I said,
well,

581
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:26,930
I would.
I would just give it to my wife to 

582
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,391
breastfeed.
I held every day and then it was like 

583
00:22:28,391 --> 00:22:28,391
264 days.
I was fat as a balloon.

584
00:22:28,391 --> 00:22:33,361
I'd get up early to get like food.
You don't eat a big bowl of a box of 

585
00:22:33,361 --> 00:22:33,361
cereal.
I kid you not.

586
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:37,870
I put the milk in the fridge.
I put a whole box and a big huge bowl.

587
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:42,880
My friend called the unger bungalow ball
and I sit there and eat a whole box,

588
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:45,070
you know,
and I would hold her all day.

589
00:22:45,071 --> 00:22:46,720
And then finally one day I said,
you know what Bro,

590
00:22:46,721 --> 00:22:47,620
you're gonna kill yourself.

591
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,070
And I couldn't imagine her in this 
world.

592
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,000
You know what I'm saying?
Having to do things to survive that some

593
00:22:55,001 --> 00:22:56,380
women have to do,
you know what I mean?

594
00:22:56,381 --> 00:22:58,000
And just looking at her and her love for
her.

595
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,160
I got up and I started walking and I 
started saying,

596
00:23:00,161 --> 00:23:02,230
let's go chat.
Let's go champ.

597
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,210
You know,
I had no entourage,

598
00:23:04,211 --> 00:23:05,860
no more friends.
My money was gone.

599
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,840
You know,
I had an entourage at one point.

600
00:23:07,841 --> 00:23:09,970
I thought that I thought they jack the 
show for me.

601
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:13,060
I had a,
you know,

602
00:23:13,061 --> 00:23:16,330
I had friends that had cars.
I had a lot of that embedded in that all

603
00:23:16,331 --> 00:23:19,510
disappeared and it was just me and my 
baby girl and my family and my wife.

604
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,550
A lot of shout out to my baby.
Let's go champ.

605
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,300
And um,
you know,

606
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:26,920
it was just a lot of her memories and 
anger and I was like,

607
00:23:26,921 --> 00:23:27,450
you know,
I got a,

608
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,620
I got a few lists,
champ.

609
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,190
You got to put this in the right place,
you know,

610
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,710
and I'll shout out to Teddy Alice.
No disrespect.

611
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:34,840
I got number lot because I learned a lot
from them.

612
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,790
Good and bad.
You're not going to say bad,

613
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:41,791
but the bad things that I survived,
those things made me who I am today and 

614
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:42,100
that's why I have a family.
That's why I'm able to,

615
00:23:42,101 --> 00:23:47,101
you know,
be here with you today at 45 years old 

616
00:23:47,101 --> 00:23:47,101
because I'm strong,
you feel me?

617
00:23:47,101 --> 00:23:48,260
But one thing he told me,
he said,

618
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:49,610
well,
he told me a long time ago,

619
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:50,630
1992,
he said,

620
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,230
whatever your fuel is,
whether it's anger,

621
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,290
love,
whatever,

622
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:57,710
use it.
It may be for some people may say,

623
00:23:57,711 --> 00:24:02,711
oh,
it's wrong because anger pumps 

624
00:24:02,711 --> 00:24:02,711
somebody's missing,
you know,

625
00:24:02,711 --> 00:24:02,711
oh,
use positivity,

626
00:24:02,711 --> 00:24:03,830
use what you got to use,
what I'm saying,

627
00:24:03,831 --> 00:24:05,180
do what you gotta do to get what you got
to get.

628
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:10,300
And there was a lot of hurt and anger 
from my pis from that situation,

629
00:24:10,461 --> 00:24:12,770
from other situations,
other management and you know,

630
00:24:12,771 --> 00:24:14,260
I mean I've been through so much 
chaplain,

631
00:24:14,261 --> 00:24:15,100
you know,
I was,

632
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:20,110
I've been heavily involved with some of 
the biggest deals and probably this 

633
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:20,110
country's,
this country's history.

634
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:22,790
I kid you not live nation deal.
I was involved with that.

635
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:27,791
I mean the first one of the first 
reality shows you looking at the 

636
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:30,611
content.
I was involved at the top level of 

637
00:24:30,611 --> 00:24:30,611
things,
disappointments,

638
00:24:30,611 --> 00:24:31,220
things not happening where I was heavily
involved in.

639
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,290
I got shocked.
So I was like,

640
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:34,340
damn,
you know what,

641
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,840
four years ago I was like,
Yo,

642
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,640
you know what,
you've done everything Shannon,

643
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,470
you've done business.
You did well,

644
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:40,370
you know,
I didn't make money.

645
00:24:40,371 --> 00:24:42,080
I didn't make,
I haven't made much money in boxing.

646
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:47,260
You know,
I'm around guys like form mean me like 

647
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:50,020
Britney Bowl and a holyfield everyday 
guys who'd made hundreds of millions of 

648
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:50,020
dollars.

649
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,820
I'm lucky if I made $4,000,000,
million dollars in Inboxing,

650
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,770
you know what I'm saying?
And the money I made,

651
00:24:54,771 --> 00:24:58,460
I've had um,
it wasn't given to me,

652
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,420
champ,
you know what I'm saying?

653
00:24:59,421 --> 00:25:00,340
I been shot.
I'm gonna.

654
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,610
Keep it real with you.
I've been shy.

655
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,990
So you know,
for me to.

656
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,830
I'm sorry I'm jumping around,
but I learned to use all that,

657
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,720
the field from that anger from getting 
shot so many times.

658
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,300
Vernon,
Shannon,

659
00:25:13,301 --> 00:25:15,590
you're not a businessman.
You're a boxer.

660
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:18,530
Every time you was homeless,
every time he was down and out,

661
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:21,770
boxing saved you.
You ran back to boxing,

662
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,570
he was doing business.
You made fish.

663
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:26,360
Made that but boxing.
You know what I'm saying?

664
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:31,430
Getting,
having peace with that balancing act 

665
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:31,430
like the negative moments that you had 
in your life,

666
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:34,150
not defining you and figuring out how to
use them for fuel.

667
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,550
Figuring out how to look back on those 
negative moments and,

668
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,860
and don't,
don't wallow in them,

669
00:25:38,861 --> 00:25:43,861
but say that's never gonna happen again.
That isn't that the great balancing act 

670
00:25:43,861 --> 00:25:47,971
of the successful fighter because 
there's not a single success for 

671
00:25:47,971 --> 00:25:50,581
fighter.
It hasn't come from some kind of 

672
00:25:50,581 --> 00:25:50,581
conflict.
Hundred percent.

673
00:25:50,581 --> 00:25:50,581
There's no other way,

674
00:25:50,581 --> 00:25:50,581
but you know,
I think,

675
00:25:50,581 --> 00:25:55,540
I think we do this.
Some of us do this and hopes there is a 

676
00:25:55,540 --> 00:26:00,161
finish line.
The finish line is you want to retire 

677
00:26:00,161 --> 00:26:02,651
with money.
You want to hopefully leave a name for 

678
00:26:02,651 --> 00:26:05,681
yourself,
know what I'm saying and you want to 

679
00:26:05,681 --> 00:26:05,681
walk away with and what your brain's 
know what I'm saying.

680
00:26:05,681 --> 00:26:07,130
So for me,
I'm trying to leave with my brains.

681
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:09,680
I'm trying to leave with some money.
You know what I'm saying?

682
00:26:09,681 --> 00:26:12,770
And I'm trying to leave with a name and 
I'm using that fuel.

683
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,430
I'm using my past and my present because
I got to tell you the truth,

684
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:21,490
although I.
There is some past hurt and you can 

685
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:21,490
probably hear them when I talk about 
certain things.

686
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:25,510
There's so much positivity.
There's so much great things that's 

687
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:25,830
happening right now that's surpassing 
the.

688
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:26,450
The,
the,

689
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,090
the,
the,

690
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,850
just the disappointment.
Excuse me,

691
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:33,940
the disappointment.
So much positivity is happening right 

692
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:33,940
now,
champ.

693
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:33,940
All around the world.
People saying,

694
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,790
let's go champ.
Yeah,

695
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:39,850
I couldn't imagine a champ.
I was wanting to commit suicide and now 

696
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:39,850
I'm walking.
Everywhere I go,

697
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:40,040
people going,

698
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:43,720
dude.
Got Texts.

699
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,350
Everybody.
When,

700
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:47,340
when we put on instagram that you were 
coming on here.

701
00:26:47,341 --> 00:26:50,490
I got texts from everybody.
Michael Bisping,

702
00:26:50,491 --> 00:26:51,690
UFC,
middleweight champion.

703
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,470
I love that guy,
man.

704
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:56,110
So many people love you,
man.

705
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:59,420
You are spreading so much fun and 
positive.

706
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,260
That's the real fruit.
Honestly.

707
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:06,340
Chambliss two tanks.
There's the disappointments and the 

708
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,591
hurt,
and then there's the reality that right 

709
00:27:08,591 --> 00:27:09,690
now I'm alive.
I survive a bad food.

710
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:12,000
I survived myself.
Drinking Champ,

711
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,200
champ.
Listen,

712
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,240
at one point Joe,
they had me on Depakote,

713
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,010
seroquel,
Xanax,

714
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:20,520
Zoloft,
and paxil altogether not together.

715
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,980
Chat for David to me.
Now listen,

716
00:27:22,981 --> 00:27:27,981
I didn't take.
I didn't take the Depakote in circle 

717
00:27:27,981 --> 00:27:27,981
because I was like,
come on champ,

718
00:27:27,981 --> 00:27:29,010
you that stuff.
It's like tranquilizers.

719
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:34,150
Geez.
That's how bad I was trying to slow you 

720
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:34,150
down.
Just trying to kill the champ.

721
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:37,110
You know what I'm saying?
This big killer and not survive that.

722
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:42,800
That's why I'm the champ.
That's why I'm the champ because I 

723
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:42,800
survived that.
This overcoming and be like,

724
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,110
you know what?
I lost 160 pounds.

725
00:27:43,111 --> 00:27:44,630
Look at me,
look at me,

726
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,610
look at me champ.
And you're 44,

727
00:27:47,611 --> 00:27:52,611
almost 44,
45 in a week or two and people are 

728
00:27:52,611 --> 00:27:52,611
ducking you like crazy.
Interesting.

729
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,620
David said he was all in,
so I'm sorry.

730
00:27:58,621 --> 00:28:00,680
I curse.
I'd probably say curse away.

731
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:04,710
Let's go chat.
David Haye was all in at one point,

732
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,900
so sorry.
Too many left hooks.

733
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,010
So did.
Yeah.

734
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,130
What happened?
I went over to England,

735
00:28:11,131 --> 00:28:16,131
which I love with my uk.
Had went over there just to fuck with 

736
00:28:16,131 --> 00:28:16,140
you got an apartment.
Totally.

737
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,760
Totally.
Again,

738
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,340
that's the field.
That's the field.

739
00:28:20,341 --> 00:28:22,420
Like honestly,
I was down and now Cham listen.

740
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,720
So many days.
I was like,

741
00:28:24,721 --> 00:28:25,620
man,
you know what?

742
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,000
I'm trying to think,
man,

743
00:28:27,001 --> 00:28:29,790
and no one's giving me a shot and I'm 
like,

744
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:30,480
you know what,
man,

745
00:28:30,481 --> 00:28:32,570
maybe I should get a job and shit.
I'm like,

746
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,290
you know,
you know what?

747
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,420
Then I woke up one day and guess what?
Snoop Dogg said,

748
00:28:36,421 --> 00:28:40,100
let's go champ.
I swear to God he smoked weed.

749
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,430
He's like,
I'm fucking with you.

750
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,610
Let's go channel.

751
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:46,500
That was the night before.
I was like,

752
00:28:46,501 --> 00:28:48,160
Bro,
the Labor floor.

753
00:28:48,161 --> 00:28:49,260
I was like,
Yo Bro,

754
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,740
you really try and champion have fights 
man,

755
00:28:51,741 --> 00:28:53,430
and maybe it's never going to happen for
you.

756
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,390
You know what I mean?
I was like,

757
00:28:54,391 --> 00:28:59,391
Yo.
And then I woke up like four or five in 

758
00:28:59,391 --> 00:28:59,391
the morning.
Snoop Dogg was saying,

759
00:28:59,391 --> 00:28:59,391
let's throw a champ.
I said,

760
00:28:59,391 --> 00:29:02,340
I'm back.
I'm back.

761
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,630
That was beautiful,
man.

762
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,440
Well,
you've done some crazy shit too,

763
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,630
man.
Like it was like,

764
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:11,470
especially with the Klitschkos,
the biscuit.

765
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,340
If I had a lot of fun,
fun videos though,

766
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,930
showing up,
drinking his water,

767
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:18,330
fucking with him,
knocked him over.

768
00:29:18,331 --> 00:29:21,800
When you were riding the paddleboard 
chunk.

769
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:24,870
Well how long ago was the paddleboard 
incident?

770
00:29:24,871 --> 00:29:26,920
And I don't even know.
I can track the time champ.

771
00:29:26,921 --> 00:29:29,040
I was like two years maybe,
but he just,

772
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:30,840
you couldn't get a fight with him.
Nah,

773
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:31,830
he saw.
I've been listening.

774
00:29:31,831 --> 00:29:33,090
I've been chasing clicks.
Go honestly,

775
00:29:33,091 --> 00:29:37,500
since like 2005 was supposed to fight 
him to fight.

776
00:29:37,501 --> 00:29:39,000
He fought in New York.
City's wasn't fight.

777
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:40,350
Uh,
Shannon breaks.

778
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,250
Everything was,
you know,

779
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:42,070
set the goal and he

780
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:45,730
wind up fighting Calvin Brock,
who's from North Carolina.

781
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,830
No one could.
I couldn't understand where we had,

782
00:29:47,831 --> 00:29:50,170
you know,
we literally had a contract.

783
00:29:50,171 --> 00:29:50,520
Yeah,
it was.

784
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:55,030
It was going to sell out a lot of fans 
with all crazy all the time.

785
00:29:55,031 --> 00:29:57,550
You know what I'm saying?
Because I'm bringing that he didn't want

786
00:29:57,551 --> 00:29:59,950
it because he was dangerous and that's 
what I'm going through right now.

787
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,230
They can say what they want about me.
Joe De Sena,

788
00:30:02,231 --> 00:30:03,220
thorough.
He's crazy.

789
00:30:03,221 --> 00:30:04,270
He's this.
But guess what?

790
00:30:04,271 --> 00:30:06,490
I'm dangerous.
I've got tons of emails.

791
00:30:06,491 --> 00:30:07,600
I'm not a snitch.
Listen,

792
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:11,260
I got tons of emails of guys with their 
managers saying,

793
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:12,850
no,
not right now.

794
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,880
He's too dangerous.
I've got deontay wilder backed out of a 

795
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,140
fight with me for $2,000,000.
He can't front.

796
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:21,850
I got everything.
Let's go chat.

797
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,880
I'm getting excited as you can tell once
you.

798
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:28,780
Once you started calling him champion to
def con four,

799
00:30:28,781 --> 00:30:33,280
he started calling him the champ.
The meters rosin now.

800
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:38,490
Now we told you about what?
I want to talk about fights and I still 

801
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:38,490
chat.
Let's go chat.

802
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:41,780
Let's go champ.
Champ.

803
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,910
And Joe Rogan.

804
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:49,540
Klitschko one was particularly hilarious
because he was on that paddle board.

805
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,990
There's nothing more humiliating.
They get knocked over.

806
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:58,370
Still wouldn't fight.
People are talking shit and he still 

807
00:30:58,370 --> 00:30:58,370
won't fight me.
He still wouldn't fight me.

808
00:30:58,370 --> 00:30:59,260
Come here.
Look at them.

809
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,840
First of all,
what is he doing out there?

810
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,890
Board by himself.
Stupid.

811
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:06,510
In the middle of nowhere.
This is almost like a setup Wednesday,

812
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,530
does he?
Yeah,

813
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:13,560
he does this every Wednesday.
I got mine.

814
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,950
Where does it go?
I'll use it at the coast or somewhere.

815
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,360
Where's that?
Is it Miami?

816
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:21,490
Fort Lauderdale.
Hollywood champs.

817
00:31:21,491 --> 00:31:22,750
Shout out to Hollywood,
Florida.

818
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,880
Better sound in the world.
Does he live down there?

819
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:25,860
Yeah,
he lived down there.

820
00:31:25,861 --> 00:31:27,160
I lived down here.
We all live down there,

821
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,460
so he would stay on that power board,
go out in the middle of the ocean.

822
00:31:30,461 --> 00:31:31,750
It'd be pat,
I need this doctor,

823
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,260
and he would just be paddled around this
exercise.

824
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:36,790
What a weird exercise.
Yeah.

825
00:31:36,791 --> 00:31:39,830
He said,
take a strange guy.

826
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:40,270
Yeah,
he's weird.

827
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,960
That's how the beef started.
Yo,

828
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:47,290
Chris,
shout out to Chris Lawrence to have you 

829
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:47,290
with factory.
Who's the greatest guy on earth?

830
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:48,160
Honestly,
like it wasn't for him.

831
00:31:48,161 --> 00:31:50,200
You know,
this guy put the fuel,

832
00:31:50,201 --> 00:31:52,600
put the cash behind me.
I was flat on my face.

833
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,790
This guy came and was like,
you know why I believe you.

834
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:56,230
I was fat.
The press.

835
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,660
He seen me in fresh market.
He was like,

836
00:31:58,661 --> 00:31:59,380
you know,
Damn.

837
00:31:59,381 --> 00:32:00,310
I was like,
you know,

838
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:05,520
he seen me.
I came back like seven or eight months 

839
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:05,520
later I came into his office.
I was like,

840
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:05,520
Yo,
champ,

841
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:05,520
what's up?
He was like,

842
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,060
Damn.
He called me and we played.

843
00:32:07,061 --> 00:32:07,540
It was like,
Yo,

844
00:32:07,541 --> 00:32:08,650
we should do something.
I was like,

845
00:32:08,651 --> 00:32:10,200
let's go champ.
And uh,

846
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,500
here we are today.
You know what I'm saying?

847
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,580
I've been traveling world thinks is 
Chris and I'm now.

848
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:19,600
I'm now,
I've actually been ordered the WBA and 

849
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,440
ordered a fight between me and Lucas 
Brown and hopefully we can make that 

850
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,050
happen.
I was seeing something on instagram that

851
00:32:23,051 --> 00:32:24,880
it's,
it's still not signed yet though.

852
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,910
You're disappointed.
Very disappointed.

853
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,880
This is Lucas Brown trying to avoid it.
Or what's time is your,

854
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,220
um,
I want to know what,

855
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,250
you know,
what Joel?

856
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:37,260
Honestly like I've been through so much 
in the last couple of years while we 

857
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:37,420
were quit school with a different funnel
with,

858
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:40,310
hey this,
I fought haze on the car and I went over

859
00:32:40,311 --> 00:32:41,600
to England,
shout out to the UK.

860
00:32:41,601 --> 00:32:44,810
I love it.
My second home I have a big,

861
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,960
a big fuel injection when I'm doing 
right now because I went over there and 

862
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,990
I've never felt that type of love 
anywhere in the world,

863
00:32:51,991 --> 00:32:53,870
like for myself to go where,
you know,

864
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:54,900
we speak the same language.

865
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:58,120
We speak their language and um,
just to have the love man,

866
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,570
it's just incredible.
Everywhere I go,

867
00:32:59,571 --> 00:33:00,740
let's go champ.
You know,

868
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,270
it's just amazing,
man.

869
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:04,490
I didn't really put a lot into what I'm 
doing right now,

870
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,380
but you decided to go over there and get
an apartment.

871
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:11,400
I had to.
I had to because I was flat on my ass 

872
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:11,400
champ and I was like,
you know,

873
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,580
trying to move up in the rankings.
I gave everybody a call out.

874
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,860
Haman,
every labella,

875
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:17,380
everybody,
everybody.

876
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,130
The cubist I gave everybody to call was 
like,

877
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:20,360
Yo,
I'm trying to get back in the game.

878
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:22,670
Nobody believed in me.
Chris Lawrence called me and was like,

879
00:33:22,671 --> 00:33:23,480
Yo,
I believe in you.

880
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:24,980
And that's what I was like,
you know what Chris?

881
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:25,580
He said,
Yo,

882
00:33:25,581 --> 00:33:26,750
you a little crazy.
I said,

883
00:33:26,751 --> 00:33:28,310
I am.
I been diagnosed a little crazy.

884
00:33:28,311 --> 00:33:29,480
I suffer from PTSD.

885
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,320
This is true,
you know,

886
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:31,250
sad.
But um,

887
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:36,670
what I'm exciting and I'm gonna make it 
happen because I'm a believer that 

888
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:37,280
nothing could stop me chatting.
We look at me,

889
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,320
nothing can stop me.
I don't care who you get.

890
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,750
Whoever say they can beat me,
they lying.

891
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:43,790
Because when we put when the Bell Ring 
Champ,

892
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:46,310
I'm a whole different person because I'm
charged.

893
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,170
Look at me.
Look what I've been through.

894
00:33:48,171 --> 00:33:51,020
Look what I'm telling you.
You can hear the emotion in my voice.

895
00:33:51,021 --> 00:33:52,460
The pain still lit.
Champ.

896
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:54,040
Let's go champ.
I'm.

897
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,310
Let's go champ.
Let's go champ.

898
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,820
I don't understand why it's so hard to 
get you fight,

899
00:33:58,821 --> 00:34:00,680
so this is what I'm saying.
Just look at me.

900
00:34:00,681 --> 00:34:03,320
Look at me and I'm crazy.
I believe I'm here.

901
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,590
I'm a promoter.
I don't care who I fight.

902
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:09,080
They could say what the and then I'm 
also not stupid.

903
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:11,900
I'm not going to fight fights for me,
for guys,

904
00:34:11,901 --> 00:34:13,340
for pennies.
That's meaningless.

905
00:34:13,341 --> 00:34:14,210
That's gonna.
Beat me up.

906
00:34:14,211 --> 00:34:15,830
I'm 44.
I'll be 45.

907
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,080
I already got,
but so much limit on his body.

908
00:34:18,081 --> 00:34:20,210
I'm a heavyweight.
I fought George Foreman Champ.

909
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,060
I fought fatality clinical champ for 
free,

910
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:28,061
by the way.
We'll talk about that later for no 

911
00:34:28,061 --> 00:34:28,780
money.
I fought Francoise,

912
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:32,810
both Ray Mercer.
You feel me in for some big punches.

913
00:34:32,811 --> 00:34:34,430
George Foreman.
So for me,

914
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:39,550
I'm not going go down.
I'm not going to fight every guy out 

915
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:42,971
there just to try to build myself.
I'm a former two time heavyweight 

916
00:34:42,971 --> 00:34:43,640
champion world.
That alone should get me a title fight.

917
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:46,370
That alone,
that's how it used to be.

918
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,490
Gods have come out of retirement from 
the.

919
00:34:48,491 --> 00:34:53,491
From the beginning,
from the Sullivan days and came out of 

920
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:53,491
no,
no fights and got a title fight.

921
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:54,470
What drives me crazy is your so 
marketable.

922
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,960
That's what drives me crazy.
You were in the UFC.

923
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:57,790
No,
no.

924
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:02,930
The best ever.
They would be lining up fights for you 

925
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:02,930
left and right.
If you were in the UFC.

926
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:02,930
Listen,
champ.

927
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:03,230
I know.
I know that.

928
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,870
That is my boy now.
That's another story in itself.

929
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,220
Nineteen 93 or four.
Maya,

930
00:35:09,221 --> 00:35:10,280
which is his name,
right?

931
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:12,980
He sold the UFC to Dana and them,
right?

932
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:18,100
Yeah.
In Two thousand one call rob right now 

933
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:18,100
he tell you who is boy is Shannon 
bricks.

934
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:21,170
He was sitting on the couch with me 
waiting for Mark Roberts to come home to

935
00:35:21,171 --> 00:35:22,460
talk,
to try to get mark,

936
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:27,790
to kick to go in with him with the UFC 
champ champ.

937
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:33,160
Sitting on the couch with a rock or 
boxing is hard to get fights lined up 

938
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:37,361
because there's so many different 
conflicting promoters and different 

939
00:35:37,361 --> 00:35:38,190
piece of the pie

940
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:43,580
and then it's hard to get fighters to 
agree to fight someone like you who's 

941
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:43,580
dangerous?
Dangerous.

942
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:43,580
I'm,
you know,

943
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:48,440
I'm fast,
I'm a punch hard and I got a chain so 

944
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:52,581
you know,
they only count on one thing that I run 

945
00:35:52,581 --> 00:35:53,130
out of gas and I say this all the time,
champ,

946
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,890
if you'll,
if your biggest asset is hoping on the.

947
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:00,270
I run out of gas,
you fucked up talking my language.

948
00:36:00,271 --> 00:36:02,270
I apologize.
Boys and girls on apologize.

949
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,440
Messed up.
Excuse me.

950
00:36:03,441 --> 00:36:04,680
I apologize.
Boys and girls,

951
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:08,640
you messed up if your own.
If you relying on me running out of gas,

952
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,860
that's your.
That's your.

953
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,400
You're going into a fight.
Took my.

954
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:14,040
Just hope you run out of gas.
You already lost champ.

955
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:19,550
You already laws now why?
They're worried that you're running out 

956
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:23,091
of gas because I know that you've 
concentrated a lot on your cardio in 

957
00:36:23,091 --> 00:36:23,091
this.

958
00:36:23,091 --> 00:36:23,091
One of the things you put on your 
instagram,

959
00:36:23,091 --> 00:36:25,200
you're always doing cardio.
You constantly doing cardio,

960
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:26,830
cardio.
If I was born with under the,

961
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,880
under the under developed lungs,
I was born less than two pounds at 

962
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,660
birth.
My mom was on heroin when I was born.

963
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,170
Jesus,
so I was.

964
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,210
I was.
I came out.

965
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,150
I came out the womb fighting this.
If I didn't go home for seven,

966
00:36:39,151 --> 00:36:40,710
eight,
nine months before when I was born.

967
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:44,130
So look at me now.
That's why I'm the Champ Joe.

968
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:48,020
That's why I'm the champ because if you 
can overcome you already to champ,

969
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:51,300
you had an underdeveloped lungs and 
asthma all my life.

970
00:36:51,301 --> 00:36:53,040
You can ask anybody.
I went to school with.

971
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,740
I went to risen Christ Lutheran School 
in Brownsville,

972
00:36:55,741 --> 00:36:58,480
Brooklyn for seven years.
Then I went to [inaudible],

973
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,850
then I went to Bishop Loughlin high 
school.

974
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:02,940
Then I went to George wingate where I 
got dragged and dropped out.

975
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,670
Now what causes asthma?
Like what exactly?

976
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:08,310
Like people like me,
we don't have it and you know it's bad,

977
00:37:08,311 --> 00:37:10,050
but you don't know much about it.
What is it?

978
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:11,370
I don't know.
Chat,

979
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,200
but you know,
looking back like we lived,

980
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,090
you know,
my mom lived in the towers,

981
00:37:15,091 --> 00:37:16,830
but like you know,
my grandma,

982
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,310
my grandma lives on Pennsylvania Avenue 
in East New York,

983
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:20,610
you know,
looking back,

984
00:37:20,611 --> 00:37:25,611
it was an old abandoned building and my 
aunt bought from the city for like $7 

985
00:37:25,611 --> 00:37:28,230
and they construct.
I'm sure it has the best best to send it

986
00:37:28,231 --> 00:37:29,340
in that type of shit,
you know,

987
00:37:29,341 --> 00:37:30,780
looking back.
But uh,

988
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:32,100
you know,
I grew up man in the hood,

989
00:37:32,101 --> 00:37:34,380
Cham I grew up in a poor in New York 
City,

990
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,260
19 seventies.
I remember everything to black out.

991
00:37:37,261 --> 00:37:39,660
I was on the train by myself.
I was nine years old,

992
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:40,710
you know,
I grew up hard,

993
00:37:40,711 --> 00:37:41,130
you know what I mean?

994
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:43,230
So when you get an asthma attack,
is it like.

995
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:48,510
I was saying that to say asthma is 
really in the city and the city's like 

996
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:49,380
that.
It's the comedy in inner city,

997
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,400
Chicago,
La,

998
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,350
New York,
shit like that.

999
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:55,140
So you think it might be related to 
environmental stuff?

1000
00:37:55,530 --> 00:38:00,530
One hundred percent now.
What does it feel like when you get an 

1001
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:00,530
asthma attack?
US.

1002
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:03,891
The worst thing in the world,
it's like nothing you can ever imagine 

1003
00:38:03,891 --> 00:38:07,401
because we take for granted because we 
take oxygen for granted because it's 

1004
00:38:07,401 --> 00:38:09,000
just here for us,
but you can go without food and water.

1005
00:38:09,001 --> 00:38:14,001
I said all the time for days to weeks,
but you can't go without oxygen for five

1006
00:38:14,071 --> 00:38:15,120
minutes with it.
Four minutes,

1007
00:38:15,121 --> 00:38:16,530
three minutes,
and that's what I.

1008
00:38:16,531 --> 00:38:17,850
that's what it's like.
It's just really,

1009
00:38:17,851 --> 00:38:19,380
you're dying.
That's the bottom line.

1010
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:24,381
You're dying.
The friend of mine described it as he 

1011
00:38:24,381 --> 00:38:26,781
said,
it's like trying to breathe through a 

1012
00:38:26,781 --> 00:38:26,781
straw.

1013
00:38:26,781 --> 00:38:26,781
It's like all of a sudden all you got is
like a little straw.

1014
00:38:26,781 --> 00:38:26,781
That's it.
That's it.

1015
00:38:26,781 --> 00:38:31,730
That's it.
Have you ever had that happen in a 

1016
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:31,730
fight?
100 times we'll goes,

1017
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:32,160
whoa,
what's that feeling like?

1018
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:37,340
The worst fear panicking and you started
talking and coming up with things and 

1019
00:38:38,381 --> 00:38:40,790
believe in doing anything you can do.
You know?

1020
00:38:40,791 --> 00:38:45,791
That's was a lot of people in a 
religious and a lot of people go to 

1021
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:48,481
different things for something outside 
of themselves that they can get a hold 

1022
00:38:48,481 --> 00:38:49,900
onto or ask for help.
For you.

1023
00:38:49,901 --> 00:38:51,640
Filming me,
I'm a little different.

1024
00:38:51,641 --> 00:38:53,920
I know it's just me.
I got to deal with these lungs and I got

1025
00:38:53,921 --> 00:38:57,310
to do what I gotta do to expand them and
what I'm in a fight in that field and he

1026
00:38:57,311 --> 00:38:58,570
comes over comm.
So what,

1027
00:38:58,571 --> 00:38:59,830
let's go champ.
Now.

1028
00:38:59,831 --> 00:39:01,750
When you,
when you have an attack,

1029
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:04,510
is it just take a while before it 
relaxes and comes back?

1030
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,100
Like what is,
what is the feeling,

1031
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:08,220
man?
I mean,

1032
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,940
I know,
I know people take inhalers.

1033
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:12,380
Dilate your lungs.
Yeah,

1034
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:12,870
yeah,
yeah,

1035
00:39:12,871 --> 00:39:13,320
yeah.
It's,

1036
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:13,960
it's,
it's,

1037
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:18,990
it's a,
it's like being in the water champion 

1038
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:18,990
drowning almost.
I guess,

1039
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:18,990
you know what I'm saying?
You're,

1040
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,380
you're panicking.
I guess.

1041
00:39:20,381 --> 00:39:21,290
You know,
you're suffering,

1042
00:39:21,291 --> 00:39:23,080
you're,
you're trying to get that oxygen and.

1043
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:23,650
But,
you know,

1044
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:26,220
it's something that I really,
uh,

1045
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,190
thanks to,
you know,

1046
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:30,870
things that I'm doing now,
my diet of first and run.

1047
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:33,490
I really feel like I've overcome it.
So,

1048
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,720
um,
the Diet,

1049
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,580
cutting out the sugar,
eating really healthy,

1050
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:39,180
no dairy,
no nothing that causes inflammation.

1051
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:42,360
That's made a big information is key.
Inflammation that.

1052
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,030
Can you CBD?
Shout out CBDS and management,

1053
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,390
these amazing.
Unreal.

1054
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,730
Now from doing that,
you uh,

1055
00:39:48,731 --> 00:39:50,200
you don't have any asthma attacks 
anymore?

1056
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:51,280
No.
Wow,

1057
00:39:51,281 --> 00:39:52,390
that's great.
Champ.

1058
00:39:52,391 --> 00:39:53,710
I feel like man of steel.

1059
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:54,720
I honestly do.
You know,

1060
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,440
I feel like I'm in the best shape of my 
life.

1061
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:01,500
Literally.
Have you ever done any breathing 

1062
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,270
exercises you ever gotten to know?
And it,

1063
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:06,150
it's a hard job because I'm a family 
man.

1064
00:40:06,151 --> 00:40:10,600
I got no kids and no excuse,
but I found I have a family to take care

1065
00:40:10,601 --> 00:40:12,730
of,
provide for and I have a career.

1066
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:14,620
So that's why the things people don't 
understand.

1067
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:19,621
Like I've always juggled both.
You don't take care of my family and 

1068
00:40:19,621 --> 00:40:20,950
myself and a boxing career and it's been
crazy,

1069
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:23,560
but it's been amazing.
Rochap and where I'm at right now.

1070
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:28,620
Oh,
let me tell you a boy joy everywhere I 

1071
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:28,620
go.

1072
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:29,230
When did you,
when did,

1073
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,560
when did the social media thing kicking 
my nephew?

1074
00:40:32,561 --> 00:40:33,940
Crack.
Shout out to Craig Brown.

1075
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:37,780
Let's go chat whenever you crack.
Came about four years ago.

1076
00:40:37,781 --> 00:40:39,820
Um,
I had my first instagram account.

1077
00:40:39,821 --> 00:40:41,740
I was able just photos then.
I was like,

1078
00:40:41,741 --> 00:40:42,430
you know what,
man,

1079
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:47,760
I'm going to lose this weight and uh,
it sounds like a corny thing to do and 

1080
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,370
he was doing like a little blog but I'm 
going to just do my own,

1081
00:40:48,371 --> 00:40:50,410
you know,
even for myself and I put it up.

1082
00:40:50,411 --> 00:40:53,380
I had non followers champ and if go to 
like,

1083
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,310
you know,
2000.

1084
00:40:54,311 --> 00:40:54,790
I was like,
man,

1085
00:40:54,791 --> 00:40:56,560
if I could ever get the 5,000
man,

1086
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:57,230
you know,
I'll,

1087
00:40:57,231 --> 00:40:58,750
I'll be there.
And um,

1088
00:40:58,751 --> 00:41:03,751
I never paid for the followers.
And they went to this whole thing where 

1089
00:41:03,751 --> 00:41:05,010
they dropped everybody who would pay for
the followers.

1090
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,500
I want to be in like $5,000.

1091
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,130
I was like,
man,

1092
00:41:09,131 --> 00:41:12,280
if I ever get to $10,000.
And then they came up with the video and

1093
00:41:12,281 --> 00:41:13,990
Craig came to town,
I was the old crack.

1094
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:19,230
I'm going to work out everyday and I 
want you to film it and we're gonna put 

1095
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:19,660
it on instagram and see how it goes.
And it just took them off.

1096
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,960
But it's just hilarious how much is 
taken much time.

1097
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:28,020
Like when I,
when I tell people that you were going 

1098
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:28,020
to beyond man,
I'm telling you like,

1099
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:28,390
not like anybody else that's ever been 
on.

1100
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,980
They got a wave.
He got excited about it.

1101
00:41:30,981 --> 00:41:32,610
I appreciate that because they don't 
have a publicist,

1102
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,650
Chad.
Uh,

1103
00:41:33,651 --> 00:41:34,220
I do everything.

1104
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:37,400
We do everything in house jam,
which is just me dragging my family.

1105
00:41:37,401 --> 00:41:40,340
We do everything.
We don't have any marketing behind us.

1106
00:41:40,341 --> 00:41:41,840
Nothing.
We just out here grinding.

1107
00:41:41,841 --> 00:41:43,370
And uh,
fortunately,

1108
00:41:43,371 --> 00:41:45,470
uh,
we let the shot now for this web.

1109
00:41:45,471 --> 00:41:48,980
Every championship has been ordered as 
far as broadening the team.

1110
00:41:48,981 --> 00:41:50,450
They'd been delaying.
Um,

1111
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,180
I'm not sure if he gon drop out and just
give me the belt.

1112
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:58,450
I'm not sure what's happening,
but if you've been waiting for them to 

1113
00:41:58,450 --> 00:41:58,450
pull the trigger,
they said they were going to,

1114
00:41:58,450 --> 00:41:58,450
you know,
find it,

1115
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:00,560
find and venue and everything that we 
talked about.

1116
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,240
Australia,
they talked about China.

1117
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,770
Who's the promoter?
Uh,

1118
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:04,220
well,
you know,

1119
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:04,970
his,
his,

1120
00:42:04,971 --> 00:42:07,310
his management team and his lawyer,
Leon Michael.

1121
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,020
Lisa had when,
most of it.

1122
00:42:09,021 --> 00:42:10,270
But if they don't come with the deal 
champ.

1123
00:42:10,271 --> 00:42:12,980
But basically I already feel like 
everybody's scared of me,

1124
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:18,130
so I didn't pick you,
just gave me the belt because I just 

1125
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:18,130
want to fight clips,
go to be honest with you,

1126
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:22,991
because I want to prove to the world 
that he saw in a biscuit because he 

1127
00:42:22,991 --> 00:42:22,991
really is.

1128
00:42:22,991 --> 00:42:24,170
I fought his brother.
Bill went on for 12 rounds,

1129
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:27,020
one on for 12 rounds.
This happened in the first round.

1130
00:42:27,021 --> 00:42:28,700
Joe,
he told you about in the first round?

1131
00:42:28,701 --> 00:42:33,701
Yeah.
And the first round not only tore the 

1132
00:42:33,701 --> 00:42:33,701
Bicep,
the tendon popped.

1133
00:42:33,701 --> 00:42:35,450
They had to go through both sides.
This was in the first row I took.

1134
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:39,080
I took like unreal punches to the head.
I forgot how many number was,

1135
00:42:39,081 --> 00:42:41,570
but I took unreal punches to the head.
They left me for dad.

1136
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,100
I ain't even get paid for the fight 
champ.

1137
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:45,320
Now what happened there?
How'd you knock your parents?

1138
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,690
Listen,
I started,

1139
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,760
I started the promotional company called
Golden Empire.

1140
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,480
It was basically backdoor,
the change to the empire.

1141
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,850
Um,
we fought.

1142
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:00,830
The company felt as though certain 
things that were allotted to me.

1143
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:03,560
I don't know.
They said I had a tab.

1144
00:43:03,561 --> 00:43:04,430
I don't know,
it's crazy,

1145
00:43:04,431 --> 00:43:05,900
but the tide was never produced.

1146
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:11,630
The companies that I started,
basically it wasn't my company anymore 

1147
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:11,870
and I was supposed I was supposed to be 
given shares.

1148
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:16,220
This company wind up going into try and 
trying to purchase EDC,

1149
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,330
EDC,
electric,

1150
00:43:17,331 --> 00:43:19,580
daisy carnival.
Through my introduction.

1151
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:24,940
You've got crazy.
It went public the night before my 

1152
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:24,940
fight,
the stock was up.

1153
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:25,400
I had no shares.
I said,

1154
00:43:25,401 --> 00:43:28,040
I'm not signing nothing into.
I know I'm guaranteed a purse.

1155
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:31,310
It was crazy.
Champions would link to my depression.

1156
00:43:31,311 --> 00:43:32,750
That's why went home after the fight and
was like,

1157
00:43:32,751 --> 00:43:34,070
Yo,
what happened here?

1158
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:36,440
I fought.
I've taught fourth fatality critical for

1159
00:43:36,441 --> 00:43:37,780
12 rounds.
I took ass,

1160
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:39,720
man even get paid.
That's crazy.

1161
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:44,770
And that was in court with them for 
eight months before I set out on like 

1162
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:48,880
pennies on the dollar because I had to 
take care of my family champ and it's 

1163
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:48,980
what drove me to the pure depression.

1164
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:50,990
But then I overcame that and now I'm 
here with you.

1165
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:52,230
How much do they fuck you out?
Oh,

1166
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:54,020
who knows?
Who knows?

1167
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,090
I mean the fight,
and let's is facts.

1168
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,660
This is champ,
but they like they say in New York facts

1169
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,020
and you fell me,
listen,

1170
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:05,350
it was the highest grossing fight as far
as a TV coverage in history at either 

1171
00:44:05,721 --> 00:44:09,560
one or two in German history.
Shannon braids versus fatality clinical.

1172
00:44:09,561 --> 00:44:14,561
He's a huge star in German and I will 
see you and I went over there and I 

1173
00:44:14,561 --> 00:44:15,380
bought action and the people was like,
Yo,

1174
00:44:15,381 --> 00:44:17,120
listen,
this guy can sell.

1175
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:19,430
We'd want to see this fight.
The ratings were unreal.

1176
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,320
It was like the highest reading in 
history,

1177
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:23,060
champ.
I ain't get $1.

1178
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:25,310
That's so not $1 channel.
How can I,

1179
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:28,370
how can I not fall into depression?
But how could I not come out of it?

1180
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:34,830
I've been fighting day one channel fight
the fight,

1181
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:39,780
fighting the brief chat.
So that was the last big bad moment.

1182
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,110
That was harsh.
That was back to normal.

1183
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:45,260
Yet she came,
but you came out of it.

1184
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,180
Just a beautiful thing about it.
You came out of it.

1185
00:44:48,181 --> 00:44:48,670
Yeah,
yeah,

1186
00:44:48,671 --> 00:44:49,770
yeah,
no doubt.

1187
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:52,620
Now at 44,
almost 45 years old,

1188
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:54,600
how much as terrorists?
December fourth,

1189
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,630
how much have you had to like alter your
training,

1190
00:44:57,810 --> 00:45:00,510
like as you've gotten older,
you've gotten wiser with it?

1191
00:45:00,511 --> 00:45:05,511
Because I remember it was something that
Larry Holmes talked about a lot when he 

1192
00:45:05,511 --> 00:45:05,511
got older.
He's like,

1193
00:45:05,511 --> 00:45:05,940
what?
What he did was he was smarter.

1194
00:45:05,941 --> 00:45:06,480
He goes,
uh,

1195
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:11,510
I don't,
I'm not trained seven days a week 

1196
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:11,510
anymore,
six days a week.

1197
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:11,510
He goes,
I'll train four or five,

1198
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:14,220
and he goes and I won't do three hours.
I'll do an hour and a half,

1199
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,300
you know,
and he just,

1200
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:20,540
he still was able to maintain a very 
high level by but understanding the 

1201
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:21,180
limitations of his body.

1202
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,630
Yeah.
Shout out to Larry Holmes,

1203
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:24,930
who's always given me nothing but great 
advice.

1204
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:28,650
He's an assassin man,
one of the greatest of all times,

1205
00:45:28,651 --> 00:45:33,460
if not the greatest unfortune of being 
right after Mohammed.

1206
00:45:33,461 --> 00:45:35,520
I was.
People just didn't appreciate them.

1207
00:45:35,521 --> 00:45:37,890
I love 100 percent,
but he could definitely get busy.

1208
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:42,950
Oh yeah.
It was a great boxer and he's been 

1209
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:42,950
giving me advice since the nineties,
early nineties.

1210
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:43,590
He told me recently,
he said,

1211
00:45:43,591 --> 00:45:45,600
don't stop fighting.
He told me,

1212
00:45:45,601 --> 00:45:46,980
don't stop fighting.
Whatever you do,

1213
00:45:46,981 --> 00:45:47,790
don't stop.
He said,

1214
00:45:47,791 --> 00:45:49,440
keep fighting.
I don't care what they tell you,

1215
00:45:49,441 --> 00:45:50,110
win,
lose or draw.

1216
00:45:50,111 --> 00:45:52,050
You said don't stop fighting.
I was like,

1217
00:45:52,051 --> 00:45:52,500
really?
He was.

1218
00:45:52,501 --> 00:45:54,000
I'm telling you,
don't fight to the end.

1219
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:55,860
That's what we do.
He said,

1220
00:45:55,861 --> 00:45:58,260
if I could've,
I would've stayed fighting to the end.

1221
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:03,740
Well,
I remember when Larry came back when 

1222
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:03,740
Mike Tyson went to jail.

1223
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:03,740
He's like,
fuck it,

1224
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:07,011
I'm coming back.
Mike Tyson's locked up and he came back 

1225
00:46:07,011 --> 00:46:07,590
and a box ray mercer.
And I was like,

1226
00:46:07,591 --> 00:46:09,450
wow,
look at Larry man,

1227
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:14,870
just skill and talent that jab.
He had like one of the most underrated 

1228
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:18,681
jabs ever bus the bus.
So when you are now a 44 years age,

1229
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,570
you're,
you're healthier than ever before.

1230
00:46:21,571 --> 00:46:24,050
You take care of yourself better than 
ever before you look fantastic.

1231
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:26,550
Have you,
have you altered your training at all?

1232
00:46:26,551 --> 00:46:28,890
Like what have you done to make sure 
that everything is,

1233
00:46:28,891 --> 00:46:29,920
uh,
you know,

1234
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:31,620
going smooth?
Yeah.

1235
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:33,210
When I first came back I was,
oh Dan,

1236
00:46:33,211 --> 00:46:35,400
of course I was again trying to make up 
for lost time.

1237
00:46:35,401 --> 00:46:38,550
So I was training everyday,
everyday and injuries would just come in

1238
00:46:38,551 --> 00:46:40,710
here and get Kiwis.
This one,

1239
00:46:40,711 --> 00:46:42,460
not one elbow,
just going to hard.

1240
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:43,400
That was going to hard.

1241
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:45,900
Then I met Dr Buck and whole foods one 
day.

1242
00:46:45,901 --> 00:46:47,550
Shout out to Dr Buck.
And he was like,

1243
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:48,480
who's Dr?
Buck,

1244
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:50,010
he's a,
he's a nice guy,

1245
00:46:50,011 --> 00:46:55,011
man.
He's what is he a Chinese doctor 

1246
00:46:55,011 --> 00:46:57,770
tightening Chinese medicine doctor.
And he gave me a great plan and he was 

1247
00:46:57,770 --> 00:46:57,770
like,
you know,

1248
00:46:57,770 --> 00:46:57,770
champ,
you should train three days,

1249
00:46:57,770 --> 00:46:59,070
take a day off,
training two days,

1250
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:00,930
take two days off,
train four days,

1251
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,160
take three days.
So.

1252
00:47:02,161 --> 00:47:02,910
And I was like,
wow.

1253
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:03,630
He was like,
trust me,

1254
00:47:03,631 --> 00:47:04,860
it wasn't work for you.
He was like,

1255
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:07,200
the body beats rest.
And I started doing that.

1256
00:47:07,201 --> 00:47:08,490
Chairman has been working for me.
Great.

1257
00:47:08,491 --> 00:47:11,760
I feel better than I've honestly.
I've never felt this strong.

1258
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:15,470
I've just bought that day for yesterday.
Shout out to Trevor Brian.

1259
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:17,640
I've been coming to heavyweight.
Uh,

1260
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,490
it gives me great work for him.
I'm,

1261
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:20,430
I'm,
I'm where I'm at,

1262
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:21,090
thanks to him.

1263
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:22,590
He's been training me for the last three
years.

1264
00:47:22,591 --> 00:47:25,080
I've been watching the train sparring.
We spoke the other day.

1265
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:27,120
I'm going to get you because he put me 
in the eye by the way,

1266
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:30,190
but I'm still pretty.
Let's go chat and um,

1267
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:31,100
you know,
I've been training.

1268
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:33,790
I've been sporing I'm the fastest I've 
ever been.

1269
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:36,610
I'm stronger than I've ever been.
I see everything.

1270
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:39,070
You know what I mean?
In the room when I was young men again,

1271
00:47:39,071 --> 00:47:43,840
I was battling with.
I'm not supposed to be here right now.

1272
00:47:43,841 --> 00:47:44,490
How many?
Like,

1273
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:49,430
you're not supposed to be here.
You're not supposed to be here.

1274
00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:51,370
You know what I'm saying?
Y'All feel good.

1275
00:47:51,371 --> 00:47:52,780
Chair.
I get it,

1276
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:58,650
I get it.
But it's all about getting yourself 

1277
00:47:58,650 --> 00:47:59,170
prepared for the moment where you could 
perform.

1278
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:04,500
And I think so many guys leave too much 
in the gym because they have this thing 

1279
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:07,090
in their head that you can't do too much
trade smarter,

1280
00:48:07,091 --> 00:48:07,720
not harder.

1281
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:08,980
That is it.
Right?

1282
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:11,170
And it's a balancing act smarter,
not harder.

1283
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:14,140
Trying to find that balance between the,
the car.

1284
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:19,310
You don't want to sell yourself short.
You don't want to not push hard enough 

1285
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:19,310
to,
to reach your potential.

1286
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:22,210
But how do you figure out like when,
when you're in,

1287
00:48:22,211 --> 00:48:23,460
when you're out,
how do you feel,

1288
00:48:23,830 --> 00:48:26,620
how do you figure out how to reach that 
perfect potential?

1289
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:27,600
Because only,
you know,

1290
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:29,880
you know,
I was working with a guy I love him,

1291
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:32,710
shout out to billy and billy told me,
he said,

1292
00:48:32,711 --> 00:48:33,880
you know what,
you got to once in a while,

1293
00:48:33,881 --> 00:48:36,720
push yourself to see how far you can go.
He said,

1294
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:38,170
you know,
you could run 15 miles,

1295
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,780
but can you run 20?
I was like,

1296
00:48:40,781 --> 00:48:41,410
damn,
you know,

1297
00:48:41,411 --> 00:48:43,810
so once in a while I do give myself 
that,

1298
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:44,520
you know,
what,

1299
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:45,520
what can you do?

1300
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:51,080
I'm going to try to make A.
I'm going to try to make it up and down 

1301
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:51,080
these stairs.
Know 100 times,

1302
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:52,720
you know what I mean?
I'm going to do the best I can just once

1303
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:54,070
in a blue and then I give it.
You know what?

1304
00:48:54,071 --> 00:48:56,740
I may do that again in three months,
two months.

1305
00:48:56,741 --> 00:48:59,360
You know what you gotta know your body 
to channel.

1306
00:48:59,361 --> 00:49:00,820
You got honest and you got to be honest 
with yourself.

1307
00:49:00,821 --> 00:49:03,430
Because I wasn't always honest with 
myself because of asthma,

1308
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:08,130
I was having high anxiety when it came 
to running and they came to like pushing

1309
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:11,350
my lungs because this is something I've 
experienced all my life since birth.

1310
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,760
I don't,
I can't remember,

1311
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:15,370
you know,
finishing school because I was always in

1312
00:49:15,371 --> 00:49:17,560
the hospital.
I grew up in St Mary's in Brooklyn.

1313
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:19,990
St John's in Brooklyn,
kings county in Brooklyn.

1314
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:21,410
I grew up in the hospital.

1315
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:24,910
I can tell you what the children's play 
rooms look like.

1316
00:49:24,911 --> 00:49:25,860
You know what I'm saying?
I'm a kid,

1317
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:28,240
kids ward.
So I grew up in these places,

1318
00:49:28,241 --> 00:49:32,200
so for me to become a box and have to 
use so much breathing,

1319
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:33,760
it's amazing.
You know what I'm saying?

1320
00:49:33,761 --> 00:49:35,980
I'm not trying to get myself a blow job,
but it's just the truth.

1321
00:49:35,981 --> 00:49:37,210
You know what I mean?
It's not.

1322
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:37,990
No.
I mean,

1323
00:49:37,991 --> 00:49:42,991
what other heavyweight champion history 
can honestly say they suffer from 

1324
00:49:42,991 --> 00:49:46,621
something.
We're underdeveloped lungs and became a 

1325
00:49:46,621 --> 00:49:46,621
champion and him on the greatest 
champion.

1326
00:49:46,621 --> 00:49:47,140
Hell no,
but could I be possibly.

1327
00:49:47,141 --> 00:49:49,480
Because if I had the lungs that some of 
these guys had,

1328
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:52,300
who knows how good I might be a fast.
I hit hard.

1329
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:54,010
I'm crazy.
I'm with whatever.

1330
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:55,450
Whatever,
champ.

1331
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:56,930
You know what I'm saying?
I'm Joe.

1332
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,750
They haven't seen the best to me to be 
honest with you.

1333
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,330
They've never seen the best and no one 
has and I.

1334
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:05,710
and that's why I'm back because why?
Like I don't want to leave this earth or

1335
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:08,440
wherever I'm going next level,
the next dimension.

1336
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:12,100
I didn't want to go st man.
I wish they had seen me because I'm nice

1337
00:50:12,101 --> 00:50:13,000
Joe.
Honestly,

1338
00:50:13,001 --> 00:50:18,001
those who really know me,
like I'm really good at this box and 

1339
00:50:18,001 --> 00:50:19,240
things like I'm self taught.
I watched Mohammad Ali and Ray Robertson

1340
00:50:19,241 --> 00:50:22,540
till I was blue in the face as a kid and
I eliminate them as a heavyweight.

1341
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:24,850
You got one of the best left hook to the
liver.

1342
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:27,860
Chavez Vamos to be on.

1343
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,050
Oh,
there you go.

1344
00:50:30,051 --> 00:50:34,430
Let's go.
Go,

1345
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,720
go.
Mass part of this coming back.

1346
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:37,640
My brother.
Yeah,

1347
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:42,710
that's definitely.
It's a stabbing left to guys around.

1348
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,260
I snatch it,
but shout out to us,

1349
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:53,480
you know,
you know black people would shout out 

1350
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:53,660
McCallum McCallum.
I got that from him.

1351
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:58,690
Oh yeah.
I met Mike when I was 18 years old in 

1352
00:50:58,690 --> 00:50:58,690
prospect park.
Oh Wow.

1353
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:00,020
I remember when he knocked out Donald 
Curry.

1354
00:51:00,021 --> 00:51:03,290
I was a huge Donald Curry fan.
I got so depressed I had to go running.

1355
00:51:03,550 --> 00:51:05,090
I,
I shut the TV off.

1356
00:51:05,091 --> 00:51:06,050
I was like,
fuck.

1357
00:51:06,051 --> 00:51:11,051
And went right.
He hit him with a left hook to the body 

1358
00:51:11,051 --> 00:51:11,051
and went upstairs,
went boom,

1359
00:51:11,051 --> 00:51:13,250
knocked him out cold.
I had to go running.

1360
00:51:13,251 --> 00:51:18,251
I ran and I said to myself,
I'm never going to get depressed at 

1361
00:51:18,251 --> 00:51:18,251
somebody else's last ever again.
I was,

1362
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:20,120
I was a kid.
I was so bummed out.

1363
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:25,610
I was like huge Donald Curry Fan.
Mike taught me that hat,

1364
00:51:25,611 --> 00:51:28,850
but I watched.
I watched the vest so much done.

1365
00:51:28,851 --> 00:51:31,130
I just feel like if we're going,
I've got to put effective.

1366
00:51:31,131 --> 00:51:32,930
I get you there.
You could call it good night.

1367
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:38,140
It might catch up to you later though.
It might be chilling for a minute round 

1368
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:38,140
next time around.
You be like,

1369
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:38,960
Oh shit.
Gotcha.

1370
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:44,680
Let's go chop now.
Do you follow a strength and 

1371
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:44,990
conditioning program?
Do you have a trainer that you work with

1372
00:51:44,991 --> 00:51:47,450
for strength and conditioning?
I work with different guys.

1373
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,430
What kind of Shit do you do?
All type of shit.

1374
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:50,510
Chad,
you name it.

1375
00:51:50,511 --> 00:51:51,560
I've.
I've been doing this for years.

1376
00:51:51,561 --> 00:51:53,400
I worked with Mackie show stone chat.
Oh,

1377
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:56,390
days before this was popular.
I mean he was back.

1378
00:51:56,391 --> 00:51:57,740
He worked with spinks,
so get me wrong,

1379
00:51:57,741 --> 00:51:58,930
but I worked with stone.

1380
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:01,480
I've worked with God.
This ain't nothing new to the chair.

1381
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:02,080
You feel me?
Well,

1382
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:07,090
she'll stone was the first guy that 
really became prominent as a strength 

1383
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:08,860
conditioning coach.
I was with the great time.

1384
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:10,160
Short time shows.
Demand.

1385
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,710
Yeah.
I worked with Duke Roofs,

1386
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:12,740
man.
You don't do groups.

1387
00:52:12,741 --> 00:52:17,741
I know the name rules.
I work with Duke rules out of New 

1388
00:52:17,741 --> 00:52:17,741
Orleans.
He's the best in the world.

1389
00:52:17,741 --> 00:52:19,430
Rod Gillis,
I worked with everybody.

1390
00:52:19,431 --> 00:52:24,431
Chimp and Maggie.
She'll stone was the guy that pumped a 

1391
00:52:24,431 --> 00:52:25,990
spinks up when he fought Lara.
He bumped them up a little bit,

1392
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:27,590
but it didn't slow him down.
That's right.

1393
00:52:27,591 --> 00:52:29,780
He had this boy,
didn't you work with Holyfield too?

1394
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:33,230
He worked with Holyfield as well.
I think he worked for Hany leaning.

1395
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:34,070
Oh,
okay.

1396
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:36,570
He might've worked with holy,
holy is the man holy.

1397
00:52:36,571 --> 00:52:39,590
He worked with everybody to holy was the
real guy who bought this.

1398
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:45,100
Bought that into prominence as far as 
strength and conditioning and and 

1399
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:45,470
especially in boxing.
You know what I mean?

1400
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:50,760
This was the first one of the first guys
were weightlifting became accepted 

1401
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:55,510
because for the longest time boxing 
trainers will tell you that weight 

1402
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:58,051
lifting slows you down,
which it kind of does because it makes 

1403
00:52:58,051 --> 00:52:58,250
you soar and then you don't perform as 
well in the gym,

1404
00:52:58,251 --> 00:53:01,070
but once you recover then you're fast 
again.

1405
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:04,730
So holyfield was like one of the first 
guys to make that leap,

1406
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:05,840
to understand like,
look,

1407
00:53:05,841 --> 00:53:10,841
he's going to go from a cruiserweight to
a heavyweight and he became a legit 

1408
00:53:10,841 --> 00:53:12,140
heavyweight.
One of the best ever.

1409
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:14,120
I mean his performance against Mike 
Tyson.

1410
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:15,380
Come on,
man.

1411
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:21,580
I want him in both him and dope.
Come on man.

1412
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:24,560
You ain't see me and him moving the 
other day.

1413
00:53:24,561 --> 00:53:25,190
Me and wholly,

1414
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:31,460
he's still got it.
He still do something,

1415
00:53:31,501 --> 00:53:33,060
but he got it because he's still 
fighting.

1416
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:33,860
No,
he ain't fighting.

1417
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,030
He stopped now,
but he's still got to champion.

1418
00:53:36,031 --> 00:53:38,090
I was moving with another day.
Wow.

1419
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:40,060
He's still got it.
Wow.

1420
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:45,980
Still bold.
Really Bold in the gym with me every 

1421
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:45,980
day.
Really?

1422
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:45,980
Every day.
Every day.

1423
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:48,150
You live in Florida.
He's a great guy.

1424
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:49,830
Killed him for this.
He is.

1425
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,750
Wow.
So he still trains all the time.

1426
00:53:51,870 --> 00:53:53,670
Everyday.
How come he doesn't fight anymore?

1427
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,240
He chilling.
He like Yo just said enough is enough.

1428
00:53:56,270 --> 00:53:58,500
You good job.
Wow.

1429
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:01,350
So when you work with a strength and 
conditioning coach,

1430
00:54:01,351 --> 00:54:06,351
like what is like a week in the life of 
Shannon Briggs when it comes to 

1431
00:54:06,351 --> 00:54:10,191
training?
Like say if this fight gets signed and 

1432
00:54:10,191 --> 00:54:12,531
you know you're going to get started,
how do you organize your weeks already 

1433
00:54:12,531 --> 00:54:12,531
started,
but what I'm,

1434
00:54:12,531 --> 00:54:16,460
what I'm doing is basically I'm using a,
a strength and conditioning day with 

1435
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:16,460
boxing.

1436
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:19,400
I running day with boxing a rest day.
A strength and condition.

1437
00:54:19,401 --> 00:54:19,950
They would,
you know,

1438
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:22,320
with boxing day and then another run 
day.

1439
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:24,900
You ever fuck with yoga the best?
Yes.

1440
00:54:25,090 --> 00:54:26,820
They understand you and Christina is 
great.

1441
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:29,180
Yeah.
So you got all kinds of stuff going on.

1442
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:32,730
Flexibility.
I'm doing everything I can do.

1443
00:54:32,731 --> 00:54:33,680
Possibly.
Um,

1444
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,370
cryo machine.
Um,

1445
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:38,070
you named a hyperbaric chamber.
Everything I could do,

1446
00:54:38,071 --> 00:54:39,700
I'm looking for the edge because 
everyone wants that.

1447
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:40,790
They get,
they got a champ.

1448
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:41,820
I'm,
I'm broke.

1449
00:54:41,821 --> 00:54:42,530
They got money.
They.

1450
00:54:42,531 --> 00:54:47,531
So imagine what they got it.
Now I'm scrambling to get everything I 

1451
00:54:47,531 --> 00:54:47,531
could get.
You know what I mean?

1452
00:54:47,531 --> 00:54:48,090
To get to the next level.
I know,

1453
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:48,930
I know,
I see it,

1454
00:54:48,931 --> 00:54:49,890
I see it,
I see it.

1455
00:54:49,891 --> 00:54:53,190
Any man and I'm me,
like many other people rooting for you.

1456
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:53,740
Thank you,
chair.

1457
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:58,910
Just it's frustrating when I see you 
getting close to these fights with guys 

1458
00:54:58,910 --> 00:54:59,810
like David head and then it falls apart.

1459
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:04,910
Sucker.
What happened when they said he was 

1460
00:55:04,910 --> 00:55:04,910
going to fight you?
I went over to England champion.

1461
00:55:04,910 --> 00:55:08,720
They showed me nothing but love.
They seen the true character of who he 

1462
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:09,030
really is and that he ain't really a 
good dude,

1463
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:09,690
man.
He's not,

1464
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,480
he's a businessman,
but he's also like a,

1465
00:55:12,481 --> 00:55:13,130
you know,
he's a,

1466
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:14,520
he's a,
he's a weird dude,

1467
00:55:14,521 --> 00:55:15,240
man.
You know what I mean?

1468
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:20,540
Y'All shook his hand.
We said we had to go because be 

1469
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:20,540
grateful.
Great.

1470
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:20,540
Fight,
win,

1471
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:21,000
lose or draw for either one of us.
Um,

1472
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:26,450
and everything was set and he,
I did everything they needed me to do 

1473
00:55:26,450 --> 00:55:26,980
and then he just,
uh,

1474
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:30,150
he felt he was looking for another deal.
And the truth of the matter is,

1475
00:55:31,290 --> 00:55:33,870
I heard this from inside that he was 
like,

1476
00:55:33,871 --> 00:55:35,430
it's too dangerous,
you know,

1477
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:37,430
that's just the bottom line,
which is what they all.

1478
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:39,660
He's a fairly small heavyweight.
Y'All smash them up.

1479
00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:41,340
That was easy one for me.
That was a layup.

1480
00:55:41,341 --> 00:55:41,880
I was like,
oh,

1481
00:55:41,881 --> 00:55:43,230
look at him on bumble,
smashed.

1482
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:45,030
And he was scared.
A little steam in his eyes.

1483
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:48,030
I'm from Brownsville.
I got one thing I could smell when you,

1484
00:55:48,130 --> 00:55:53,130
when you're scared.
I'm from the same neighborhood as Mike 

1485
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:53,130
Tyson.
Ready?

1486
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:53,130
Paul?
I know when a man scared.

1487
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:53,130
I went up on him.
Joe.

1488
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:54,630
I looked in his eyes.
I seen his lips.

1489
00:55:54,631 --> 00:55:56,280
He was trembling.
He was scared.

1490
00:55:56,281 --> 00:55:57,200
I could smell it.
I was like,

1491
00:55:57,330 --> 00:56:00,630
oh,
this is a layup layup champ.

1492
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:02,160
This is an easy one.
Champ.

1493
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:04,150
Yeah.
What does he wait?

1494
00:56:04,151 --> 00:56:05,770
He's not a.
it's not a heavy guy.

1495
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:08,180
I had that one child.
I could see me just snatching them.

1496
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:10,240
You went Vegan?

1497
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:17,960
I'm eating bowls and cows and dinosaurs.
Straight animal.

1498
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:22,560
What is your diet like?
Like what?

1499
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:25,240
How do you organize your diet?
Everything.

1500
00:56:25,241 --> 00:56:26,590
You know what I'm saying?
Just to try to,

1501
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:28,420
you know,
if it's whole foods,

1502
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:29,790
I can't buy it.
They love.

1503
00:56:29,810 --> 00:56:31,090
They know me well,
you know what I'm saying?

1504
00:56:31,091 --> 00:56:33,430
You know they should be sponsored.
Me Shout out to whole foods.

1505
00:56:33,710 --> 00:56:35,540
I'm,
I'm there everyday.

1506
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:39,100
It's a 150 to $200 a day for the final.
Yes.

1507
00:56:39,101 --> 00:56:40,060
Every day.
Every day.

1508
00:56:40,061 --> 00:56:45,061
For the last four years we've been 
eating from old food stamps are not 

1509
00:56:45,061 --> 00:56:47,550
cheap.
One 50 to 200 every day of his bed.

1510
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,840
And normally I'm not bragging.
I'm actually complaining because.

1511
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:52,390
But that's what it took because I'm no 
sugar.

1512
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,580
I'm eating right.
I use coconut sugar,

1513
00:56:54,581 --> 00:56:59,581
you know what I'm saying?
I just tried to do the best I can 

1514
00:56:59,581 --> 00:56:59,581
consider.
I don't,

1515
00:56:59,581 --> 00:56:59,581
I'm not a nutritionist.

1516
00:56:59,581 --> 00:57:03,920
Uh,
I live on my iphone as you can tell 

1517
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:03,920
them,
always posted and I'm always looking for

1518
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:04,180
new recipes or new,
the next edge,

1519
00:57:04,181 --> 00:57:04,570
what's,
you know,

1520
00:57:04,571 --> 00:57:06,490
what I'm saying?
The Best I can for myself.

1521
00:57:06,491 --> 00:57:07,150
So I eat,
I eat,

1522
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:09,550
I eat fairly well.
Organic meats.

1523
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:11,180
I don't eat pork.
I'm on each.

1524
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:13,930
I don't eat shell fish,
no dairy,

1525
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:15,790
you know what I mean?
I'm just keeping it as best I can.

1526
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:18,340
Do you get your blood work monitor to do
that as well?

1527
00:57:18,341 --> 00:57:18,890
Yeah.
You know,

1528
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:20,590
I try to keep my levels where they need 
to be.

1529
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:22,840
Do you supplement a Tta?
Unfortunately,

1530
00:57:22,841 --> 00:57:23,590
no,
not right now.

1531
00:57:23,591 --> 00:57:24,280
No,
not right now.

1532
00:57:24,281 --> 00:57:25,320
Some CBD that,
um,

1533
00:57:25,330 --> 00:57:26,230
I've been,
you know,

1534
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:28,660
and I was ahead of me ahead of the game 
with that to chairman.

1535
00:57:28,661 --> 00:57:33,661
I'm not trying to get myself a blow job,
but I was suffering from depression 

1536
00:57:33,661 --> 00:57:37,471
champ and I was fortunate to uh,
I went and got like 10 different Mris 

1537
00:57:37,471 --> 00:57:38,230
and I was like,
what's wrong with me?

1538
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:40,060
I'm always depressed.
I'm always feeling like,

1539
00:57:40,061 --> 00:57:41,130
you know,
I'm,

1540
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:46,140
I feel anxiety overcoming me and I was 
given this night and then I was hip to 

1541
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:48,780
cbd for a few years ago,
four years ago,

1542
00:57:48,781 --> 00:57:50,920
and changed life,
changing experimentation.

1543
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:52,440
I mean,
but I'm here,

1544
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:57,920
I'm here.
But CBD is an interesting thing because 

1545
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,841
a,
it's a part of marijuana but it's not 

1546
00:58:00,841 --> 00:58:01,180
psychoactive.
So a lot of people like they,

1547
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:03,160
they hear about it and they get worried 
about it.

1548
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,080
They feel like it's drugs.
Yes.

1549
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:08,260
But it has nothing to do with that.
It's like one of the beneficial parts of

1550
00:58:08,261 --> 00:58:13,261
the plant just eliminates inflammation 
and for people that have arthritis or 

1551
00:58:13,261 --> 00:58:15,740
all kinds of other injuries or just hard
training like you're doing.

1552
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:17,620
And I was drinking since I was,
I was a kid,

1553
00:58:17,621 --> 00:58:18,340
you know what I mean?
Honestly.

1554
00:58:18,341 --> 00:58:19,770
And I had a,
I had a,

1555
00:58:19,771 --> 00:58:22,520
I had a family member that,
that was an oh,

1556
00:58:22,590 --> 00:58:25,270
marijuana smoke and we're kinda was.

1557
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:29,080
The person was abusive to me,
very abusive physically and mentally.

1558
00:58:29,081 --> 00:58:34,081
And um,
so the smell of marijuana was something 

1559
00:58:34,081 --> 00:58:34,540
that always reminded me of those times 
as a child.

1560
00:58:34,541 --> 00:58:35,200
So,
you know what I mean,

1561
00:58:35,201 --> 00:58:40,201
growing up.
So I never was attracted to motor we 

1562
00:58:40,201 --> 00:58:40,201
ever,
but drinking was my king,

1563
00:58:40,201 --> 00:58:43,310
which was worse and I was drinking since
I was a kid and I've shouldn't have been

1564
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:46,000
in.
Just led me down some dark days when you

1565
00:58:46,001 --> 00:58:48,850
drink it during training camps.
I'm not really,

1566
00:58:48,851 --> 00:58:51,520
I wasn't never that type of drinkable 
after a fight,

1567
00:58:51,521 --> 00:58:52,630
you know,
celebration,

1568
00:58:52,631 --> 00:58:57,631
Heineken,
Heineken and Hennessy was chasing and 

1569
00:58:57,631 --> 00:58:57,631
just being,
you know,

1570
00:58:58,190 --> 00:59:00,950
a kid,
not a kid being an idiot.

1571
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:03,650
And how'd you get off it?
Um,

1572
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:04,990
my daughter man,
you know,

1573
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:06,040
adopt my daughter,
you know,

1574
00:59:06,041 --> 00:59:07,750
I was taking,
like I said,

1575
00:59:07,751 --> 00:59:12,751
I was taken um,
the different antidepressants and they 

1576
00:59:12,751 --> 00:59:12,751
gave me Xanax as well.

1577
00:59:12,751 --> 00:59:17,550
And my mom was a heroin addict.
I told you crack and she died on my 

1578
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:21,871
birthday of overdose.
And I said if I was ever hooked on 

1579
00:59:21,871 --> 00:59:21,871
drugs,
I'd rather die.

1580
00:59:21,871 --> 00:59:22,880
And you know what I'm saying,
be a slave.

1581
00:59:22,881 --> 00:59:27,881
I hooked or something.
I remember not taking the Xanax for a 

1582
00:59:27,881 --> 00:59:29,120
couple days and just having like the 
jitters and almost like,

1583
00:59:29,121 --> 00:59:30,870
Yo,
this is horrible.

1584
00:59:30,871 --> 00:59:35,871
When that happened,
that went on for like six months and I 

1585
00:59:35,871 --> 00:59:38,000
was blessed and when I was introducing 
cbd because my life changed,

1586
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:43,120
I went from not knowing what I was going
to do when fearful to you're calming 

1587
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:47,001
down and this was all from my past.
So many things that happened to me as a 

1588
00:59:47,001 --> 00:59:50,471
kid I don't need to harp on,
but my childhood was rough and people 

1589
00:59:50,691 --> 00:59:55,480
don't realize how much keith internalize
and become adults are bad.

1590
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:58,110
Broken kid is a worse adult forms.

1591
00:59:58,300 --> 00:59:58,950
Yeah.
Forms.

1592
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:01,760
And when I got money champ,
I was 20 years old.

1593
01:00:02,490 --> 01:00:03,350
My manager,
you know,

1594
01:00:03,351 --> 01:00:04,970
move me out to jersey.
I was living in west,

1595
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:07,100
south,
west orange,

1596
01:00:07,101 --> 01:00:08,240
big mansion,
you know what I'm saying?

1597
01:00:08,241 --> 01:00:10,550
Always living in a nice house and of the
car it was,

1598
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:11,750
but I had no work,
no money,

1599
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:14,810
but I had the things that,
you know what I'm saying to me,

1600
01:00:14,811 --> 01:00:16,670
I made it.
I had a care credit card,

1601
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,410
you get close.
I want to do is fight.

1602
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:23,590
So I had a nice thing going,
but I wasn't really dealing with the 

1603
01:00:23,590 --> 01:00:24,710
fact that my mom was on drugs.
My Dad was in jail.

1604
01:00:25,710 --> 01:00:27,230
You know what I'm saying?
I was born that piece.

1605
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:32,290
I wasn't nowhere near piece I didn't 
know and that's what yoga has done for 

1606
01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:35,291
me.
Yoga has done that for the people that 

1607
01:00:35,291 --> 01:00:35,291
know.
They see the crazy side of me.

1608
01:00:35,291 --> 01:00:36,620
Like I'm like the spiritual crazy 
warrior.

1609
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:38,690
Don't even say spiritual because I'm not
even a spirit.

1610
01:00:38,691 --> 01:00:43,691
I'm just like the crazy warrior,
but I get centered when I have to and 

1611
01:00:43,691 --> 01:00:47,170
that's what I'm learning.
Like I never knew how to turn on the 

1612
01:00:47,170 --> 01:00:47,750
Lesko champ.
I tell everyone,

1613
01:00:47,751 --> 01:00:50,120
listen,
there is a champion with all over people

1614
01:00:50,121 --> 01:00:51,560
see me hype.
How I go from.

1615
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:53,910
That's me turning on the champ,
champ.

1616
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:57,050
That's me turning on the champ because I
didn't know how to do that.

1617
01:00:57,290 --> 01:01:00,830
That's why I say I'm in the best shape 
ever because now I can zone out.

1618
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:02,660
I was on my way over here,
champ in the car.

1619
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:03,870
I was like,
Damn.

1620
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:05,450
Oh nervous.
Let me tell you why.

1621
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:07,940
When I was fat and depressed and down 
and out,

1622
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:10,880
I was watching you and I said,
damn,

1623
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:16,660
I need to get my shit together and to do
that one day I'll be on Joe Rogan's 

1624
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:16,660
show.

1625
01:01:16,730 --> 01:01:21,730
I'm not bullshitting you.
Anybody can say whatever they want to 

1626
01:01:21,730 --> 01:01:21,730
say.
I'm seeking God's with you.

1627
01:01:21,730 --> 01:01:24,080
So on the way over here I was nervous,
but I was like,

1628
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:27,010
let's go chat.
No need to be nervous.

1629
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:33,220
You know?
What are the things I love about 

1630
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:33,220
youtube?
Like you,

1631
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:33,920
you push that positivity on other people
and you want them to be positive too.

1632
01:01:33,921 --> 01:01:35,420
It's not just about,
you know,

1633
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:37,790
like you call everybody champ.
Everybody's a champion.

1634
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:39,740
They're all smiling.
You'll hear your videos.

1635
01:01:39,741 --> 01:01:40,510
That's real.
That's.

1636
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:42,290
I'm happy man,
because I'm happy to be alive.

1637
01:01:42,291 --> 01:01:43,880
Job wanting to.
I wanted to kill myself.

1638
01:01:43,881 --> 01:01:46,250
So many kids commit suicide around the 
world.

1639
01:01:46,251 --> 01:01:48,710
Champion.
I've got thousands of emails and texts.

1640
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:50,630
Kid you not,
I can show you my phone.

1641
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,880
Thousands of emails and text with people
around the world.

1642
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:57,950
Champ.
I was suffering from depression and I 

1643
01:01:57,950 --> 01:01:57,950
wanted to kill myself,
but thanks to you watching the videos,

1644
01:01:57,950 --> 01:02:00,710
I'm motivated and I'm like,
but my bs in thousands,

1645
01:02:00,711 --> 01:02:03,620
over 15,000
of people telling me,

1646
01:02:03,621 --> 01:02:04,320
champ,
thank you.

1647
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:05,960
Thank you.
So this is for me.

1648
01:02:05,961 --> 01:02:07,220
It's amazing.
No publicist,

1649
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:09,650
no company behind me.
This is just me and Craig.

1650
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,220
That's all you need though.
Know what I'm saying?

1651
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:16,230
You feel me?
But that's why I feel good because I'm 

1652
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:16,230
like,
damn,

1653
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:17,300
if this was not real organic,
I'd be like,

1654
01:02:17,301 --> 01:02:18,560
okay.
I could be like,

1655
01:02:18,561 --> 01:02:19,260
ah,
you know,

1656
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:19,980
but this is just

1657
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:22,910
real.
It's not like a marketing mind and this.

1658
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:28,010
I'm either going to win,
lose or draw and they ain't gonna be no 

1659
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:28,010
losing being who I'm going to be for 
once in my life.

1660
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:32,690
Well that's the beautiful thing about 
social media is that it lets you be you 

1661
01:02:32,690 --> 01:02:33,250
100 percent.
Like there's no director goes.

1662
01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:34,920
Yeah,
there's no direct on Shannon.

1663
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:40,190
I see what you're saying right now.
I want to want something different from 

1664
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:40,230
chance.
Right,

1665
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:40,720
right,
right,

1666
01:02:40,730 --> 01:02:41,600
right.
I'm sticking.

1667
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:43,020
I tell people when it comes to that,
people say,

1668
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:43,860
oh,
it's boring.

1669
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:45,500
You know you do the same thing on 
Thomas.

1670
01:02:45,501 --> 01:02:46,440
He says,
meet me.

1671
01:02:46,441 --> 01:02:51,441
I'm like,
you know what is as you watched it too 

1672
01:02:51,441 --> 01:02:51,441
much.
Come back later.

1673
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:55,380
They come back later to tell people that
about my podcast.

1674
01:02:55,381 --> 01:02:56,370
You know,
man,

1675
01:02:56,580 --> 01:02:58,620
I'm tired of listening to you could take
some time off.

1676
01:02:58,630 --> 01:03:00,510
I get tired of me too.
Let's go chat.

1677
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:04,410
Jason.
Changing Shit.

1678
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:09,630
Ministerials good man.
For Real.

1679
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:11,880
I needed to vent to which we can hear.
You know what?

1680
01:03:11,890 --> 01:03:13,860
I needed to vent a little bit about the 
alice thing and not that.

1681
01:03:13,861 --> 01:03:14,740
You know what I mean?
It,

1682
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:16,520
I held it in all this time because this 
feel.

1683
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:17,970
I'm sure I'm gonna lie,
you know,

1684
01:03:17,971 --> 01:03:19,350
I watched him many days.
I said,

1685
01:03:19,351 --> 01:03:20,240
damn man,
like,

1686
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:22,910
you know why he threw me under the bus 
like that and you know what I mean?

1687
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:25,790
Hurt.
So now he's a hard man.

1688
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:31,140
I got a huge article coming out for espn
by brand Johnathan Butler.

1689
01:03:32,190 --> 01:03:34,530
It's unreal.
I looked for him to do this piece.

1690
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:37,830
He's the guy who's done like,
he's done some amazing pieces.

1691
01:03:37,831 --> 01:03:39,150
Champ,
Mike Tyson,

1692
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:41,250
Tupac.
He saw some amazing pieces.

1693
01:03:41,251 --> 01:03:43,920
He's got a piece coming out that's going
to be into the Monitor,

1694
01:03:43,921 --> 01:03:46,320
but not that I'm plugging him.
I just want you to know this is going to

1695
01:03:46,321 --> 01:03:46,860
be unreal.

1696
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:49,020
Beautiful.
It's going to be on ESPN.

1697
01:03:49,490 --> 01:03:50,950
ESPN.
It's going to be.

1698
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:57,000
That's giant,
but there's a lot of momentum in your 

1699
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,261
side.
It's just a matter of getting a fight 

1700
01:04:00,261 --> 01:04:00,261
sign.
You don't have.

1701
01:04:00,261 --> 01:04:00,600
The heavyweight division right now is 
pretty exciting.

1702
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,330
It's not in the face.
Done the big,

1703
01:04:02,331 --> 01:04:04,150
the fights done.
I'm just saying for,

1704
01:04:04,290 --> 01:04:06,830
for Brown,
those people to to act like they had.

1705
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:12,260
They were going to grab the bull by the 
Horn and not be able to come up with a 

1706
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:12,260
deal.
You know they had.

1707
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:14,230
I think they have a couple of days until
we go to bed.

1708
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:16,370
Like if that was the case that we should
have just went to perse.

1709
01:04:16,371 --> 01:04:18,170
But I'm ready now.
What I'm saying.

1710
01:04:18,171 --> 01:04:19,800
I'm ready now.
I don't want no more delays.

1711
01:04:19,801 --> 01:04:22,010
I don't want to play with this boy.
Another boy.

1712
01:04:22,050 --> 01:04:24,930
Don't want to pay with this man,
this young man with a family.

1713
01:04:25,170 --> 01:04:27,270
I don't want to play with him.
I want the bell will ring because he and

1714
01:04:27,271 --> 01:04:29,270
my way.
I understand,

1715
01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:33,210
but he's in my way and there's nothing 
like people don't want to stand like you

1716
01:04:33,211 --> 01:04:34,680
can call me crazy.
But that's,

1717
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:35,670
that's okay.
Look,

1718
01:04:36,190 --> 01:04:41,190
my mind and my mind.
This is like a already written destiny.

1719
01:04:41,610 --> 01:04:46,610
I was a lot of shape.
I was dealt and now I wanted to kill 

1720
01:04:46,610 --> 01:04:46,770
myself and now I came back with nothing 
behind me.

1721
01:04:46,771 --> 01:04:48,290
But the people,
the people's chairs,

1722
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:50,130
everywhere I go,
he's in my way.

1723
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:52,920
He's just like a tornado come and he's a
role.

1724
01:04:53,010 --> 01:04:55,140
I'm a temporal part.
He just said my wait,

1725
01:04:55,230 --> 01:04:58,250
because I got a bigger picture champ.
All the belts I want to.

1726
01:04:58,260 --> 01:04:59,910
People around the world,
all the belts,

1727
01:04:59,911 --> 01:05:04,911
chaps.
I want people all around the world and 

1728
01:05:04,911 --> 01:05:04,911
be like,
Yo,

1729
01:05:04,911 --> 01:05:04,911
hear my story.
I got to.

1730
01:05:04,911 --> 01:05:06,150
I don't have a great record.
I've got like six or seven point five,

1731
01:05:06,151 --> 01:05:07,170
six lawyers.
Who knows.

1732
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:09,000
Um,
I had ups and downs.

1733
01:05:09,001 --> 01:05:14,001
I've never been considered a great,
but I fought guys who will tell you on 

1734
01:05:14,001 --> 01:05:14,001
the low man.
He kept busy.

1735
01:05:14,001 --> 01:05:14,670
Excellent.
It's Louis.

1736
01:05:15,630 --> 01:05:16,880
They'll tell you guys who,
who,

1737
01:05:16,930 --> 01:05:19,190
who know me or who,
who box acts,

1738
01:05:19,210 --> 01:05:20,650
Chris Bird.
They say,

1739
01:05:20,670 --> 01:05:23,470
you know what Shit and never read that.
Never really seen Shannon.

1740
01:05:23,950 --> 01:05:25,750
They never really seen Shannon.
I'm honest.

1741
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:27,040
I'm.
I'm keeping it real.

1742
01:05:27,041 --> 01:05:29,140
They never seen me.
They going to see me win this fight.

1743
01:05:29,141 --> 01:05:30,370
Get done.
They're going to see me.

1744
01:05:30,371 --> 01:05:31,630
They going to see the real shit.
They're going to say,

1745
01:05:31,631 --> 01:05:32,990
wow,
we didn't know yet.

1746
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:38,040
All that talent we didn't know.
Let's go chap chap stick won't see it 

1747
01:05:39,551 --> 01:05:41,130
for real.
This is a lot of suffering.

1748
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,530
Pain Champ and a lot of love too because
they're all around the world.

1749
01:05:44,530 --> 01:05:45,560
They say,
unless champion,

1750
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:47,290
they fill in the positivity and they 
said,

1751
01:05:47,291 --> 01:05:49,690
you know what jam we behind you man.
The people,

1752
01:05:49,691 --> 01:05:54,691
sure that's not happening in boxing 
champ and that's and that and that is 

1753
01:05:54,691 --> 01:05:58,171
another reason that's fueling me to look
at the box and look at a state of the 

1754
01:05:58,171 --> 01:05:58,690
heavyweight division.
It was flat before me,

1755
01:05:58,691 --> 01:06:00,950
champ.
Crypto was doing nothing but sticking up

1756
01:06:00,951 --> 01:06:02,980
division for kids.
Grab whole,

1757
01:06:02,981 --> 01:06:03,610
grab,
hold.

1758
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:09,120
Come on.
Champion heavyweight champion of the 

1759
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:10,691
world.
You're supposed to be the biggest 

1760
01:06:10,691 --> 01:06:10,691
project.
Sports.

1761
01:06:10,691 --> 01:06:10,691
You're supposed to be out there doing 
interviews.

1762
01:06:10,691 --> 01:06:14,890
You're supposed to be Muhammad Ali,
you to stay around people's around kids 

1763
01:06:14,890 --> 01:06:14,890
around the world.
Supposed to know her head,

1764
01:06:14,890 --> 01:06:18,960
which had been the world when I was out 
there trying to campaign and even to 

1765
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:22,321
this day,
you ask somebody who's the heavyweight 

1766
01:06:22,321 --> 01:06:22,321
champion and rural.
They don't even know.

1767
01:06:22,321 --> 01:06:22,321
Nobody knows.

1768
01:06:22,321 --> 01:06:23,050
Nobody knows now.
And he was a white guy.

1769
01:06:23,110 --> 01:06:24,280
Yeah,
but ask them now.

1770
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:25,870
They don't even know.
Nobody knows.

1771
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:29,730
Nobody knows.
Now you go around and keep people.

1772
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:30,990
Call me one thing,
champ.

1773
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:33,490
Yeah,
they say chat when you're fighting.

1774
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:35,230
Exactly.
So that's what I.

1775
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:38,560
that's what I'm talking about.
Bringing back the imagery to the game.

1776
01:06:38,561 --> 01:06:40,120
Listen,
people told me all the time,

1777
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:42,340
the people in the game,
but I hear people you know,

1778
01:06:42,341 --> 01:06:47,341
ride you.
I see one of the uncommons ride me to 

1779
01:06:47,341 --> 01:06:49,891
you and it started thorough and I 
appreciate your chair for holding me 

1780
01:06:49,891 --> 01:06:49,891
down,
but listen to this champion.

1781
01:06:49,891 --> 01:06:54,090
Listen to this chap,
the people inside of boxing is one 

1782
01:06:54,551 --> 01:06:55,920
thing.
Inside of contact.

1783
01:06:55,930 --> 01:07:00,930
Sports is one thing,
but when you got people who don't watch 

1784
01:07:00,930 --> 01:07:01,360
boxing,
who don't never watch box and said,

1785
01:07:01,361 --> 01:07:03,230
hey champ,
I watched your champion.

1786
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:05,920
It's social media,
it's social media.

1787
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:08,170
You feel me?
That's what's doing it.

1788
01:07:08,171 --> 01:07:09,820
So that's my goal.
That's my point.

1789
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,400
The boxing people who.
Not that I don't want them to know me,

1790
01:07:12,610 --> 01:07:14,230
I'm not trying to alienate them and say,
oh no,

1791
01:07:14,231 --> 01:07:15,400
fuck them.
I'm saying,

1792
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:16,750
that's cool.
I love y'all.

1793
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:17,440
Oh,
you don't like me.

1794
01:07:17,441 --> 01:07:18,910
I know I suck.
I'm missing a door.

1795
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:24,060
But the outside people all around the 
world who don't watch boxing the ladies 

1796
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:25,360
to kids.
It's the champ.

1797
01:07:25,550 --> 01:07:28,450
Shannon,
the candidate who I want.

1798
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:30,370
I want this.
I guess what I have right now.

1799
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:35,580
Kids everywhere.
I came out of a place the other day and 

1800
01:07:35,580 --> 01:07:35,580
a kid I know he wasn't a boxing fan.
He said,

1801
01:07:35,580 --> 01:07:36,850
hey champ.
I said,

1802
01:07:36,851 --> 01:07:38,680
wow.
I felt good champ.

1803
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:40,210
I felt good bro.
I was like,

1804
01:07:40,211 --> 01:07:41,360
that was like a weed.
He's moment.

1805
01:07:42,820 --> 01:07:44,140
I felt like the readings moment,
like,

1806
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:45,370
hey champ,
you know what?

1807
01:07:45,370 --> 01:07:46,450
I'm saying that's what I want,
man.

1808
01:07:46,451 --> 01:07:48,070
I want people to be excited about 
bicycles.

1809
01:07:48,090 --> 01:07:50,680
Boxing saved my life.
Every time I left the game chat,

1810
01:07:50,770 --> 01:07:55,770
my life fell down,
but there was a long period of time or 

1811
01:07:55,770 --> 01:07:58,891
Klitschko was a heavyweight champion 
where literally no one could tell you 

1812
01:07:58,891 --> 01:08:01,861
outside of real hardcore boxing fans who
the heavyweight champ was here in 

1813
01:08:01,861 --> 01:08:05,761
America right here was never the case.
You would ask people who's the 

1814
01:08:05,761 --> 01:08:05,761
heavyweight champion and they would 
have,

1815
01:08:05,761 --> 01:08:06,190
oh,
it's Mike Tyson,

1816
01:08:06,191 --> 01:08:08,050
it's Lennox Lewis,
evander Holyfield,

1817
01:08:08,051 --> 01:08:10,540
whoever it was,
but for a long period,

1818
01:08:10,541 --> 01:08:13,270
no one cared.
It was just a such a boring style.

1819
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:18,480
He didn't want.
He didn't want to mix it up and put her 

1820
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:20,891
in line.
He was more concerned with his legacy 

1821
01:08:20,891 --> 01:08:21,220
gas plant is safe.
And you know what I mean?

1822
01:08:21,221 --> 01:08:26,221
I,
I think it's like you look at wrestling 

1823
01:08:26,221 --> 01:08:26,540
or even like in the mail,
like you guys come back,

1824
01:08:26,541 --> 01:08:27,830
you guys fight and you lose.

1825
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:28,580
Okay,
you come back,

1826
01:08:28,581 --> 01:08:30,050
you fight again.
There's no set.

1827
01:08:30,051 --> 01:08:31,910
Schedule One with these guys with 
boxing.

1828
01:08:32,090 --> 01:08:34,130
Um,
and then guys don't want to lose.

1829
01:08:34,131 --> 01:08:35,240
You don't.
And then they fight in God,

1830
01:08:35,241 --> 01:08:36,860
they fight what I call pies,
you know,

1831
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:39,140
they call it fighting pies just to stack
up.

1832
01:08:39,141 --> 01:08:44,141
They wreck it remains.
So they got great records and we all do 

1833
01:08:44,141 --> 01:08:44,141
it.
You got to patch.

1834
01:08:44,141 --> 01:08:44,950
This is the game.
Unfortunately it's the game.

1835
01:08:44,951 --> 01:08:45,950
But if you were telling me,
look,

1836
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:49,430
you can fight,
you can fight and win,

1837
01:08:49,431 --> 01:08:52,910
lose or draw your guaranteed going to 
fight another fight for $3,000,000.

1838
01:08:53,150 --> 01:08:56,750
You'd fight this guy all the time.
But what happens when you lose?

1839
01:08:56,830 --> 01:08:59,290
And then you go back to making $500 a 
fight,

1840
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:00,590
$5,000
a fight.

1841
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:02,570
So guys don't want to lose,
right?

1842
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:04,940
It's just part of the game in boxing the
record,

1843
01:09:04,941 --> 01:09:09,941
the winning record is so much more 
important than this than MMA fights in 

1844
01:09:09,941 --> 01:09:09,941
mma.
It's just about a p and exciting,

1845
01:09:09,941 --> 01:09:10,550
right?
I had some losses.

1846
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:11,650
Nobody gives a shit.
You know?

1847
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:12,740
I was K one,
right?

1848
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:13,740
Yeah.
A kid.

1849
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:19,940
What was that like getting the worst 
thing ever.

1850
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:23,600
Who did you fight?
A Erik Erickson.

1851
01:09:24,490 --> 01:09:24,970
Tom,
Eric,

1852
01:09:24,980 --> 01:09:28,790
Tom Erickson.
I kicked the shit out of each child.

1853
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:32,210
I think I'm the first guy ever to scream
and the history.

1854
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:37,550
Did you train it all leg kicks in?
I did.

1855
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:40,190
And um,
it was shit.

1856
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:42,350
It was for nothing because he kicked the
hell out of me.

1857
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:43,760
He's a big fellow,
a man.

1858
01:09:43,761 --> 01:09:46,990
I couldn't believe it felt like it.
Something like two bats it together.

1859
01:09:49,970 --> 01:09:51,980
I said if he kicked me one more time,
I got to go down.

1860
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:53,960
I can't take it.
I don't care,

1861
01:09:53,961 --> 01:09:55,510
you know?
I said I can't take it if he want more.

1862
01:09:55,511 --> 01:09:58,940
He kicked me again.
Like I said,

1863
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:01,570
I said I got.
I jabbed into the body,

1864
01:10:01,770 --> 01:10:02,690
boof.
And when I,

1865
01:10:02,810 --> 01:10:05,240
and he looked at me because I'm able to 
read fast,

1866
01:10:05,241 --> 01:10:08,840
you got to be able to read within tenths
of a second milliseconds and boxing.

1867
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:12,080
I read in his eyes that that wasn't that
bad.

1868
01:10:12,230 --> 01:10:17,230
Like he must've felt like it wasn't that
strong of a punch and he could come and 

1869
01:10:17,230 --> 01:10:18,920
he came in to punch at that point and 
when he came into punch,

1870
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:19,560
I just,
I,

1871
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:21,350
I let,
I let the candy go.

1872
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:23,360
I left,
right go freedom champ.

1873
01:10:23,450 --> 01:10:25,280
Got Them on top of the Hash.
Sheesh.

1874
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:29,330
God,
I get excited because I know the feeling

1875
01:10:29,331 --> 01:10:32,630
now tapped in all these years I was 
playing with the game.

1876
01:10:32,780 --> 01:10:37,780
Now I finally tapped in because I've 
focused and concentrated on just doing 

1877
01:10:37,780 --> 01:10:38,960
this,
that now I know how to put it there.

1878
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:40,730
I know how.
This is my gift.

1879
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:43,460
This has been my gift.
I've had a rough life,

1880
01:10:43,461 --> 01:10:48,461
but my gift is that I have a talent in 
something that I've always kind of ran 

1881
01:10:48,461 --> 01:10:50,510
from if I had my own reasons,
but now I've got it.

1882
01:10:50,511 --> 01:10:53,510
I've channeling,
I've channeled this shit kind of thing.

1883
01:10:53,511 --> 01:10:54,990
Come about,
man.

1884
01:10:55,010 --> 01:10:56,540
Herman Triseto.
Shout out to Herman.

1885
01:10:56,541 --> 01:10:57,050
He,
um,

1886
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:58,460
you know,
me,

1887
01:10:58,470 --> 01:11:03,470
me and the hustle,
me and a struggle with trying to make 

1888
01:11:03,470 --> 01:11:03,470
some bread.
Man.

1889
01:11:03,470 --> 01:11:03,470
I'm a businessman.
You know,

1890
01:11:03,470 --> 01:11:03,470
I'm,
I'm,

1891
01:11:03,470 --> 01:11:03,560
I'm a working man,
not a businessman.

1892
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:06,170
I'm a working man and it's work.
You know what I mean?

1893
01:11:06,171 --> 01:11:09,950
If,
if that was going to fight in the UFC,

1894
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:13,260
I came out to Vegas Champ Out Dana,
put me up at the,

1895
01:11:13,261 --> 01:11:15,930
um,
Dana put me up at the palm or somewhere,

1896
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:18,300
a mg.
He put me up in the suite.

1897
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:20,250
He was talking about me fighting.
What's my boy name?

1898
01:11:20,430 --> 01:11:25,430
The big white dude back in the days,
I want to say around 2005.

1899
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:27,020
Six.
Uh,

1900
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:28,530
randy coture.
No,

1901
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,960
no big tall,
tall,

1902
01:11:30,961 --> 01:11:31,710
white dude.
Tim.

1903
01:11:31,711 --> 01:11:32,890
Sylvia.
No.

1904
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:37,900
Give me one of truth.
Was he how highly ranked was the guy?

1905
01:11:38,310 --> 01:11:39,750
He was the one.
He became the champ.

1906
01:11:40,110 --> 01:11:41,700
Okay.
He wanted me to fight them.

1907
01:11:41,701 --> 01:11:43,020
They put me at.
Flew me in,

1908
01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:44,490
put me in Dana Nomi.
Well,

1909
01:11:44,850 --> 01:11:47,240
Tim Silvia.
Silvia.

1910
01:11:47,310 --> 01:11:49,260
Was it?
That was before Tim Silvia.

1911
01:11:49,261 --> 01:11:50,910
Probably.
There's a toll dude.

1912
01:11:50,911 --> 01:11:53,430
Real toll after other tims.
So tall white dude.

1913
01:11:53,430 --> 01:11:58,290
He wanted to fight in Tim Silvia Fault 
Ray Mercer and Dr with one punch.

1914
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:00,230
He fought,
right?

1915
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:01,290
Oh,
okay.

1916
01:12:01,291 --> 01:12:02,760
That's him.
Wait a minute.

1917
01:12:03,570 --> 01:12:06,420
Ray Mercer also far merchant and beat 
him.

1918
01:12:06,930 --> 01:12:11,140
No.
Kimbo slice and Kimbo a guillotine.

1919
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:12,870
Dm.
And then ray mercer,

1920
01:12:13,110 --> 01:12:18,110
Tim Silvia.
And it was supposed to be a boxing 

1921
01:12:18,110 --> 01:12:20,691
match,
but the athletic commission wouldn't 

1922
01:12:20,691 --> 01:12:21,240
sanction it for boxing match because Tim
Silvia didn't have any boxing matches.

1923
01:12:21,510 --> 01:12:26,510
I have to see this picture though,
if I see a picture of you tall and his 

1924
01:12:26,510 --> 01:12:29,850
skin was hanging down like how long he 
can share a landscape was eco box 

1925
01:12:29,850 --> 01:12:30,150
though.
The kid he could box.

1926
01:12:30,151 --> 01:12:31,620
He had some good shit though with his 
hands.

1927
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:36,880
He,
I don't know if his name but dude could 

1928
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:36,880
get busy.
I was going to fight.

1929
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:36,880
He asked me to fight him.
We were like,

1930
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:39,180
look,
100 was negotiated for me again.

1931
01:12:39,181 --> 01:12:39,810
He was like,
Yo,

1932
01:12:39,811 --> 01:12:42,420
uh,
give us somebody a little easier because

1933
01:12:42,421 --> 01:12:43,230
they wanted me to fight.

1934
01:12:43,230 --> 01:12:45,220
Um,
what's his name now?

1935
01:12:45,221 --> 01:12:48,110
Mark Hunt the black brother.
What's his name over?

1936
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:50,460
He was fighting k one for awhile.
He fought.

1937
01:12:50,461 --> 01:12:53,050
You have say to UFC to carry goodrich 
goodrich.

1938
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:55,170
Let's go big daddy.
They wouldn't be the fight.

1939
01:12:55,171 --> 01:12:58,810
Good rich chapter chair.
I've been in the game chat.

1940
01:12:58,890 --> 01:13:03,890
So did you.
Did you take any wrestling classes or 

1941
01:13:03,890 --> 01:13:03,890
anything?
Listen,

1942
01:13:03,890 --> 01:13:04,170
Yo kid,
you weren't ready for this.

1943
01:13:04,430 --> 01:13:05,400
You ready for this?
I'm ready.

1944
01:13:05,430 --> 01:13:06,150
Let's go.
Champ.

1945
01:13:06,330 --> 01:13:08,870
American top team La.
That's how.

1946
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:11,400
That's my boy.
That's my boy.

1947
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:13,770
That's my boy man.
Dan Is my homie.

1948
01:13:13,870 --> 01:13:17,280
He was there when they were in a store 
front and Boca.

1949
01:13:17,430 --> 01:13:19,560
No,
Jim a store front in Boca.

1950
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:22,060
I went down there because they wanted me
to teach them how some teachers,

1951
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:25,170
some teachers teach them boxing.
That was like 2001.

1952
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:26,970
Why?
And um,

1953
01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:31,590
I started messing with dom and I was 
doing some mom take wine dough and I was

1954
01:13:31,591 --> 01:13:33,640
doing mma,
Jujitsu and all that.

1955
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:35,490
And it was kicking my ass,
but I was loving.

1956
01:13:35,491 --> 01:13:37,230
I was getting strong.
I was like,

1957
01:13:37,231 --> 01:13:39,320
Yo,
this might be a great type of thing that

1958
01:13:39,321 --> 01:13:41,650
costs up with the box and that's what 
I'm in the clenches,

1959
01:13:41,670 --> 01:13:42,740
you know what I'm saying?
Oh yeah.

1960
01:13:43,070 --> 01:13:44,840
Big Difference in the clenches right,
man,

1961
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:46,260
that's why I.
Sprint planning is important.

1962
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:51,590
Yeah.
It's important for boxes now and these 

1963
01:13:51,590 --> 01:13:51,590
days.
So what happened?

1964
01:13:51,590 --> 01:13:51,590
How come you never wound up doing an MMA
fight?

1965
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:57,400
Um,
besides not wanting to get my ass 

1966
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:57,400
kicked.
Oh,

1967
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:58,800
you know,
just so hard on the body.

1968
01:13:58,830 --> 01:13:59,550
Hard,
brutal,

1969
01:13:59,610 --> 01:14:00,300
brutal.
Brutal.

1970
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:01,900
Wrote joints,
the NAC,

1971
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:05,250
it'd be like me playing basketball.
I can't dribble.

1972
01:14:05,550 --> 01:14:10,550
I'm like,
the only black man in the world can 

1973
01:14:10,550 --> 01:14:10,550
dribble a basketball.
I can't catch a football,

1974
01:14:10,550 --> 01:14:11,410
you know?
Wow.

1975
01:14:11,650 --> 01:14:12,010
So

1976
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:14,530
you just decided it's just not for you 
so bad.

1977
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,120
I pay one experience,
man.

1978
01:14:16,121 --> 01:14:17,260
I tell you,
I was like,

1979
01:14:17,261 --> 01:14:18,330
man,
I just.

1980
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:19,480
You know what's funny?
Because I went,

1981
01:14:19,510 --> 01:14:21,460
I went back to the hotel and I was 
chilling.

1982
01:14:21,461 --> 01:14:23,350
I was laying in bed and um,
I went to sleep.

1983
01:14:23,351 --> 01:14:28,351
I just had a little couple of bruises 
and when I woke up my entire both legs 

1984
01:14:28,351 --> 01:14:29,410
were black and blue.
I was like,

1985
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:30,250
I painted.
I was like,

1986
01:14:30,251 --> 01:14:31,420
Oh snap.
I was like,

1987
01:14:31,421 --> 01:14:32,530
Oh shit.
I was like,

1988
01:14:32,570 --> 01:14:33,880
Yo,
just get me Outta here.

1989
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:34,850
They paid me.
Well Chad,

1990
01:14:34,851 --> 01:14:37,890
I might've made like in over two years I
made.

1991
01:14:37,910 --> 01:14:39,340
I made a good chunk of change over 
there.

1992
01:14:39,341 --> 01:14:41,610
I went to the irs chasing me down.
I don't got no bread.

1993
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:45,280
There was fun.
It was fun.

1994
01:14:45,281 --> 01:14:46,120
It was fun.
It was fun.

1995
01:14:46,150 --> 01:14:51,150
Let's go chat.
So you decided one and done with 

1996
01:14:51,150 --> 01:14:51,150
Katelyn?
Yeah.

1997
01:14:51,150 --> 01:14:51,280
Katelyn wasn't the thing for me.
And um,

1998
01:14:52,150 --> 01:14:57,150
but I love it,
I love watching it and I think that 

1999
01:14:57,150 --> 01:14:59,060
training was tremendous for me.
I was in general that they was saying 

2000
01:14:59,060 --> 01:15:00,540
tyrone sponge,
that's the chat for real motherfucker,

2001
01:15:00,550 --> 01:15:01,630
y'all.
He's the man for real.

2002
01:15:01,631 --> 01:15:03,070
Let's go champ.
He says,

2003
01:15:03,071 --> 01:15:04,960
man,
help me out with my kickboxing because I

2004
01:15:04,961 --> 01:15:06,670
think it's definitely helped my boxer.
Yeah,

2005
01:15:06,671 --> 01:15:11,671
he sent in the borderline.
He's been doing a lot of boxing matches 

2006
01:15:11,671 --> 01:15:12,190
and not exactly sure if he's going back 
to kickboxing,

2007
01:15:12,191 --> 01:15:17,191
he'll fight anybody anywhere.
Anytime though I'm just waiting for the 

2008
01:15:17,191 --> 01:15:18,790
right contract or anything.
He'll beats beats.

2009
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:21,340
He's very talented.
He's a very smart dude too.

2010
01:15:21,341 --> 01:15:22,200
He's on the ball.
Yeah,

2011
01:15:22,330 --> 01:15:24,070
I'm going gonna be working with him for 
this fight as well.

2012
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:26,740
Oh beautiful.
So when,

2013
01:15:27,330 --> 01:15:30,070
so you said we're very close to purse 
bits.

2014
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:34,220
So it's happening 100 percent.
Whether this guy is in or not.

2015
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:36,850
They gave me,
they gave me the bell in a box.

2016
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:39,580
I'll take it.
I'd rather winning in the ring,

2017
01:15:40,090 --> 01:15:41,220
but I'm,
you know,

2018
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:41,590
I'm,
I'm,

2019
01:15:41,591 --> 01:15:43,010
I'm frustrated.
I ain't gonna lie to each other.

2020
01:15:43,030 --> 01:15:44,920
I'm very frustrated.
I'm trying to be happy about,

2021
01:15:44,921 --> 01:15:49,921
you know,
my situation because I am getting in a 

2022
01:15:49,921 --> 01:15:49,921
fight,
but again,

2023
01:15:49,921 --> 01:15:51,550
I'm the politics of boxing with ups and 
downs,

2024
01:15:51,551 --> 01:15:52,030
these,
these,

2025
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:56,050
these managers or shift DNA saying one 
thing and they're telling me to wait.

2026
01:15:56,170 --> 01:15:58,170
I don't know why I say the whole thing 
with me is like,

2027
01:15:58,190 --> 01:15:59,250
like what happened with,
hey,

2028
01:15:59,270 --> 01:16:04,270
it's happened to me so many times.
I live in fear that I'm going to get 

2029
01:16:04,270 --> 01:16:04,270
shocked.
Like,

2030
01:16:04,270 --> 01:16:04,270
okay,
what,

2031
01:16:04,270 --> 01:16:08,860
what,
what they gonna shock me with now 

2032
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:08,860
because if they're delaying,
so what's next?

2033
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:10,210
You know what mean I'm expecting 
something if nothing happens,

2034
01:16:10,690 --> 01:16:11,980
I'm hoping for the best,
but I'm ready.

2035
01:16:13,330 --> 01:16:15,700
It's gotta be a weird situation field.
Right?

2036
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:17,380
It's all good champ.
I'm the champion.

2037
01:16:17,381 --> 01:16:19,390
This is what they got to do to try to 
keep me down.

2038
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:21,690
What the heavyweight division right now 
is exciting though.

2039
01:16:22,330 --> 01:16:23,650
Now there's a lot champ.
Yeah,

2040
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:25,500
that's a big part of it.
Yeah.

2041
01:16:25,510 --> 01:16:27,190
There's a lot of good stuff happening,
right?

2042
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:32,250
Yeah.
And what did you think about Ortiz's 

2043
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:32,250
fight the other night?
Uh,

2044
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:35,220
it was,
it was shocking that he went to the 

2045
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:35,220
distance,
right?

2046
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:35,220
No,
not at all.

2047
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:35,220
No,
not at all.

2048
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:39,151
Because he fought Malique Scott,
who was the guy who was in tip top 

2049
01:16:39,151 --> 01:16:39,400
shape.
We get an instagram always trading,

2050
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:42,100
always training.
Very,

2051
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:43,900
very defensive,
very defensive,

2052
01:16:43,901 --> 01:16:46,480
which is hard to beat a guy like that.
It's hard and I got a guy who don't want

2053
01:16:46,481 --> 01:16:47,080
to get knocked out.

2054
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:48,330
Chat.
They filmed me.

2055
01:16:49,090 --> 01:16:50,830
I'm not getting knocked out.
He gonna do whatever he can.

2056
01:16:50,831 --> 01:16:53,770
Not to get knocked out.
Doesn't mean he gonna fight back and let

2057
01:16:53,790 --> 01:16:54,750
me see.
You get knocked down.

2058
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:56,230
That's what he did.
Yeah,

2059
01:16:56,630 --> 01:16:57,680
too.
But you know,

2060
01:16:58,120 --> 01:16:59,280
he did.
He did what he had to do.

2061
01:16:59,510 --> 01:17:04,510
It just happens.
But there was a once instagram where 

2062
01:17:04,510 --> 01:17:07,141
you're mocking deontay wilder technique,
legs coming up off the ground when he 

2063
01:17:07,141 --> 01:17:08,350
was punching.
I actually like him,

2064
01:17:08,351 --> 01:17:11,360
but you know what?
You gotta do what you gotTa do that for.

2065
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:13,130
I liked him actually.
I think he could fight.

2066
01:17:13,430 --> 01:17:16,190
I think he's very talented.
I think he's dangerous to anybody,

2067
01:17:16,191 --> 01:17:18,830
including myself.
He's a vicious puncher.

2068
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:21,090
He's a wild puncture.
He's the one of those bony,

2069
01:17:21,091 --> 01:17:23,480
strong.
Those bony dudes hit your boy.

2070
01:17:23,490 --> 01:17:24,620
Woo.
You finished.

2071
01:17:24,621 --> 01:17:26,330
You know what I mean?
So he's dangerous.

2072
01:17:26,331 --> 01:17:27,260
He's,
he can punch,

2073
01:17:27,470 --> 01:17:29,300
um,
you know,

2074
01:17:30,170 --> 01:17:32,480
he kinda like,
you know,

2075
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:34,700
he got that he offended me because I 
don't give a shit,

2076
01:17:34,701 --> 01:17:35,210
you know what I'm saying?

2077
01:17:35,210 --> 01:17:38,870
But he kind of took it personal that I 
was coming after him and I wasn't,

2078
01:17:38,871 --> 01:17:39,740
you know,
I'm a jokester.

2079
01:17:39,741 --> 01:17:44,741
I like to have fun and bug out.
He kind of took it like a little bit 

2080
01:17:44,741 --> 01:17:44,741
like,
Oh,

2081
01:17:44,741 --> 01:17:45,320
you know this and I'm like,
I ain't like that.

2082
01:17:45,321 --> 01:17:46,020
You don't want.
I'm not a,

2083
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:48,820
I'm not a street dude,
but I really am.

2084
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:51,210
It could be whatever you want me to be 
[inaudible] I'm from the street,

2085
01:17:51,211 --> 01:17:52,070
you know what I'm saying?
But I was like,

2086
01:17:52,071 --> 01:17:52,740
don't do that.
You know what?

2087
01:17:52,810 --> 01:17:56,960
Because trying to get busy,
if you touch me,

2088
01:17:56,970 --> 01:18:01,970
if you make me,
if you put me to that point in the 

2089
01:18:01,970 --> 01:18:01,970
street anywhere,
I'm known now and I don't want to be.

2090
01:18:01,970 --> 01:18:05,980
I'm not that type of person,
but I'll defend the champ because I got 

2091
01:18:05,980 --> 01:18:05,980
make.
I went to my babies.

2092
01:18:05,980 --> 01:18:05,980
I love them.
You feel me?

2093
01:18:05,980 --> 01:18:07,580
So I ain't gonna let nobody ever hurt 
the chap.

2094
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:09,830
Did you ever see that video where 
deontay wilder box,

2095
01:18:09,831 --> 01:18:11,780
some Internet troll shit.
Yeah.

2096
01:18:12,710 --> 01:18:14,000
That guy's fucking crazy.
Yeah.

2097
01:18:14,001 --> 01:18:15,650
Yeah.
I'm a knock the wall down.

2098
01:18:15,710 --> 01:18:16,550
He gonna get.
I'm gonna get.

2099
01:18:16,551 --> 01:18:21,551
I'm a,
I'm a knockout Lucas Brown and then I'm 

2100
01:18:21,551 --> 01:18:23,300
going to let a Deontae beyonce wild.
The beyonce,

2101
01:18:23,930 --> 01:18:26,690
beyonce.
You know what I'm saying?

2102
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:31,190
Put up his BC belt and I'm a knock flat.
Starch out starch.

2103
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:33,580
I would like to see that.
Yeah,

2104
01:18:33,610 --> 01:18:38,610
I would like to see the fight for sure.
Let's go chat and let's go check this 

2105
01:18:38,610 --> 01:18:38,610
out.
Yeah,

2106
01:18:38,610 --> 01:18:43,511
exactly.
Now when you're 45 years old in 

2107
01:18:43,511 --> 01:18:44,780
December,
December fourth,

2108
01:18:44,810 --> 01:18:49,810
realistically,
how much more time you think you're 

2109
01:18:49,810 --> 01:18:50,120
going to be fighting after now called 
Brown and um,

2110
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:53,240
hopefully I'll get the window clinical 
with a in Joshua,

2111
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:55,340
anthony,
Joshua who a tremendous talent.

2112
01:18:55,770 --> 01:18:57,560
Um,
after that,

2113
01:18:57,830 --> 01:18:58,320
you know,
uh,

2114
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:00,320
go after 'em,
whoever,

2115
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:01,520
whoever has the belt,
man,

2116
01:19:01,521 --> 01:19:02,990
I'm going to keep.
Larry Holmes said,

2117
01:19:02,991 --> 01:19:05,360
don't stop by rehearsing.
Larry told me,

2118
01:19:05,361 --> 01:19:06,200
don't stop.
He said,

2119
01:19:06,201 --> 01:19:06,860
keep fighting.
Switch.

2120
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:08,120
You do make money.
Have Fun.

2121
01:19:08,121 --> 01:19:10,070
Enjoy your life.
And who's having more fun with me?

2122
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:12,940
Everywhere I go,
champion will be your happy.

2123
01:19:12,950 --> 01:19:14,640
They're motivated and that's,
that's to me,

2124
01:19:14,641 --> 01:19:16,610
it's for the first time in my life gives
me some purpose.

2125
01:19:16,730 --> 01:19:19,310
Other than making money,
I've been struggling to make money since

2126
01:19:19,311 --> 01:19:22,970
I came home from school and then have a 
place to live for once in my life.

2127
01:19:22,971 --> 01:19:26,540
For once in my life I'm doing something 
that's not involved.

2128
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:29,630
Me using the money from her fight to buy
a car and look fair to you.

2129
01:19:29,631 --> 01:19:30,030
And then,
you know,

2130
01:19:30,050 --> 01:19:32,000
hang out.
I'm just being myself.

2131
01:19:32,001 --> 01:19:34,700
I'm a bump champs or bump.
I don't know what I'm saying.

2132
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:39,700
I don't buy.
I refused because that was part of my 

2133
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:39,700
downfall,
you know,

2134
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:41,420
wanting things,
wanting material things.

2135
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:46,560
So finding,
finding power and things like that to 

2136
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:47,630
make myself feel good.
I'm going to go buy a new car.

2137
01:19:47,631 --> 01:19:48,610
I'm going to buy chain.
I'm gonna.

2138
01:19:48,611 --> 01:19:49,500
Buy a hat.
I'm gonna.

2139
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:52,100
Buy this expensive 50 sweater now the 
champ.

2140
01:19:52,101 --> 01:19:53,270
Don't do none of that shit.
The champ.

2141
01:19:53,271 --> 01:19:54,560
Just like a bump.
This is me.

2142
01:19:54,561 --> 01:19:59,561
You know what I'm saying?
Because I'm not putting value in that 

2143
01:19:59,561 --> 01:19:59,561
anymore.
Which means what?

2144
01:19:59,561 --> 01:20:01,040
What I'm finding so amazing is that 
everywhere I go,

2145
01:20:01,041 --> 01:20:02,300
people are saying,
hey jim,

2146
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:03,320
thanks for the videos,
man.

2147
01:20:03,321 --> 01:20:03,890
We love you,
man.

2148
01:20:03,891 --> 01:20:06,190
Can I get a picture?
Can I get a video that nothing can outdo

2149
01:20:06,230 --> 01:20:07,830
that shift?
Because I'd had a little bit of money.

2150
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:12,980
Never made a lot of money.
Like those guys were hundreds of 

2151
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:15,830
millions of dollars,
but I made a little bit of money for me 

2152
01:20:15,830 --> 01:20:15,830
to feel good.

2153
01:20:15,830 --> 01:20:17,070
You know what I'm saying?
But I never felt love.

2154
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:22,380
No.
My mom was in the streets trying to put 

2155
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:22,890
a roof over our head.
I never had a dad.

2156
01:20:22,891 --> 01:20:25,050
You know what I'm saying?
I never had a brother and sister.

2157
01:20:25,290 --> 01:20:26,630
I was basically on my own.
You know,

2158
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:28,080
you look at my personality,
you can tell.

2159
01:20:28,081 --> 01:20:33,081
I've watched a lot of television.
I grew up reading comic books and 

2160
01:20:33,081 --> 01:20:35,800
cartoons,
so I never had love and to have what I 

2161
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:38,460
feel is love from people who genuinely 
don't know me and just see me and say,

2162
01:20:38,461 --> 01:20:39,420
man,
thank you.

2163
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:40,740
Two emails.
That's,

2164
01:20:40,830 --> 01:20:43,080
that's more fulfilling than anything 
I've ever felt.

2165
01:20:43,110 --> 01:20:43,560
You feel me?

2166
01:20:43,730 --> 01:20:44,490
I do feel.
Yeah,

2167
01:20:44,550 --> 01:20:45,760
I think it's important,
man.

2168
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:49,930
I think your message is important and 
what you're saying about having all that

2169
01:20:49,940 --> 01:20:54,940
bullshit,
all the material possessions and 

2170
01:20:54,940 --> 01:20:54,940
counting on it,
you know,

2171
01:20:54,940 --> 01:20:54,940
I remember Chuck d talking about that 
once,

2172
01:20:55,040 --> 01:21:00,040
you know,
it was during the height of when people 

2173
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:02,581
have giant wheels and they're fucking 
cars and every all in that room and he 

2174
01:21:02,581 --> 01:21:02,581
was like,
he was like,

2175
01:21:02,581 --> 01:21:05,180
I drive a Ford explorer and he's like in
a it,

2176
01:21:05,410 --> 01:21:08,420
I don't put any,
any power in that

2177
01:21:08,570 --> 01:21:12,350
shit at all.
So sad that I was a slave to it.

2178
01:21:12,410 --> 01:21:17,410
I feel so miserable when I think about 
the days that I spent money on sweaters,

2179
01:21:18,081 --> 01:21:21,290
caused jewelry bottles at the club.
I'm just like,

2180
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:24,580
Damn what a lot of athletes go broke 
trying to keep up with the Joneses,

2181
01:21:25,050 --> 01:21:30,050
but it's part of,
as part of our culture because we never 

2182
01:21:30,050 --> 01:21:30,050
had shit.
Right.

2183
01:21:30,050 --> 01:21:34,271
So now we're like,
you're feeling good because someone's 

2184
01:21:34,271 --> 01:21:37,271
admiring you for anything.
The admiration is what becomes 

2185
01:21:37,271 --> 01:21:37,271
intoxicated.
You know,

2186
01:21:37,271 --> 01:21:39,140
what I'm fighting for me was that as 
well.

2187
01:21:39,141 --> 01:21:39,460
You know,
I'm,

2188
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:42,170
I'm finding on gratitude,
gratitude things that,

2189
01:21:42,340 --> 01:21:42,630
you know,
I,

2190
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:43,000
I,
I,

2191
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,590
I was smart though because I've always 
wanted to keep a place,

2192
01:21:45,591 --> 01:21:47,660
a roof over my head and I'll put value 
in that as well.

2193
01:21:47,661 --> 01:21:52,661
But you do a lot of the things too is 
just for show it off other people and 

2194
01:21:52,661 --> 01:21:54,860
that once I was able to get past that 
and that was,

2195
01:21:54,861 --> 01:21:56,270
you know,
part of me was cutting my hair.

2196
01:21:56,570 --> 01:22:00,420
You don't have it locked for 27 years 
and people want to come over here.

2197
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:02,270
Man,
just the response from people was just,

2198
01:22:02,660 --> 01:22:05,030
it was amazing.
Just the people looking at me like,

2199
01:22:05,031 --> 01:22:06,350
wow,
look at you.

2200
01:22:06,770 --> 01:22:09,020
You cut your hair,
you finish.

2201
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:14,350
You'll never get.
You'll never be nothing or boxes over 

2202
01:22:14,350 --> 01:22:14,350
for you.

2203
01:22:14,350 --> 01:22:14,400
Why do you think you cut your hair?

2204
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:16,900
Oh,
it was the sickest thing.

2205
01:22:16,901 --> 01:22:21,310
It was like the most eye opening thing 
and people were literally like,

2206
01:22:21,870 --> 01:22:23,170
I could.
They were telling me,

2207
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:26,140
but I could also see deeper into what 
they were saying.

2208
01:22:26,141 --> 01:22:27,280
Like,
you're finished.

2209
01:22:27,460 --> 01:22:30,490
You'll never make another movie.
You never fight.

2210
01:22:30,550 --> 01:22:35,550
You're just like you.
That was your marketing tool that you 

2211
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:35,550
would just your head.
I was like,

2212
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:35,550
no,
no,

2213
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:36,730
I can really fight.
I was like,

2214
01:22:36,731 --> 01:22:38,200
no,
I really got hands and they were like,

2215
01:22:38,410 --> 01:22:40,240
you know,
and no one believed in me,

2216
01:22:40,241 --> 01:22:45,241
so that's what makes this thing even 
more powerful than the fact that I got 

2217
01:22:45,241 --> 01:22:45,970
rid of that here and I'm still doing my 
thing.

2218
01:22:45,971 --> 01:22:46,690
I'm still a child.

2219
01:22:47,170 --> 01:22:52,170
Weird thing to,
for people to focus on dreadlocks 

2220
01:22:52,170 --> 01:22:55,380
marketing.
They looked at it like it was a 

2221
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:56,910
marketing.
It was back in the day that was a big 

2222
01:22:56,910 --> 01:22:56,910
part of who you were and they always 
marketed your hair.

2223
01:22:56,910 --> 01:22:58,130
Right.
The crazy dreadlocks.

2224
01:22:58,131 --> 01:22:58,570
Right,
right,

2225
01:22:58,571 --> 01:22:59,500
right.
I understand,

2226
01:22:59,501 --> 01:23:00,970
but I don't want to stay because.
Yeah,

2227
01:23:02,380 --> 01:23:04,480
you really know me that that's just 
nothing.

2228
01:23:04,510 --> 01:23:05,980
That was mark and again,

2229
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:10,360
the hair was blocking me that he was 
blocking my vibe because I was like,

2230
01:23:10,361 --> 01:23:11,470
Yo,
this haircut,

2231
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:16,520
the hair had his own personality,
his own personality and then it's really

2232
01:23:16,571 --> 01:23:21,571
shit.
And then cutting the hair and see how 

2233
01:23:21,571 --> 01:23:21,571
people treated me.
I was like,

2234
01:23:21,571 --> 01:23:21,790
you know what?
It's cool.

2235
01:23:22,150 --> 01:23:23,500
I'm gonna just,
I'm just gonna be me.

2236
01:23:23,530 --> 01:23:24,790
You know,
I'm not going to try to talk,

2237
01:23:24,910 --> 01:23:25,900
uh,
uh,

2238
01:23:26,170 --> 01:23:28,780
correct or you know what I'm saying?
My Dick,

2239
01:23:28,810 --> 01:23:33,810
my Dick,
she is going to be what it's going to 

2240
01:23:33,810 --> 01:23:33,810
be.
People telling me.

2241
01:23:33,810 --> 01:23:33,810
Oh,
Shannon,

2242
01:23:33,810 --> 01:23:33,810
why don't you do movies?
Why don't you do this chant when I don't

2243
01:23:33,810 --> 01:23:33,940
speak Welsh?
Yeah,

2244
01:23:34,570 --> 01:23:38,560
I'm hardcore ghetto.
If you want to go into every word you're

2245
01:23:38,561 --> 01:23:40,210
saying that your champion.
I said,

2246
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:41,800
you know what I mean,
I'm not the type you feel me.

2247
01:23:41,801 --> 01:23:44,080
I'm just keeping it real.
Like I've learned one thing in.

2248
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:46,210
Shout out to Chris Morris.
Stay in your lane,

2249
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:51,360
you know,
and that's one of his best sayings that 

2250
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:51,360
I hear him say it all the time,
but it's true.

2251
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:52,570
I learned that stay in my lane champion.
Don't know what you're really good at.

2252
01:23:53,020 --> 01:23:55,090
Really good at being Shannon.
Let's go.

2253
01:23:55,870 --> 01:23:58,840
That's it.
And that took me that.

2254
01:23:59,050 --> 01:24:01,080
You'll get one more time.
No,

2255
01:24:01,180 --> 01:24:05,230
and I mean that because that's what I 
did know who I didn't know who I was.

2256
01:24:05,260 --> 01:24:08,520
I grew up overnight.
What's understandable?

2257
01:24:08,521 --> 01:24:13,521
I mean,
it takes a long time for everybody if 

2258
01:24:13,521 --> 01:24:13,521
everything's worked out perfectly 
released,

2259
01:24:13,521 --> 01:24:14,170
man,
everybody,

2260
01:24:14,171 --> 01:24:19,171
everybody,
every person that's ever lived know you 

2261
01:24:19,171 --> 01:24:19,171
don't want.
No one ever fails.

2262
01:24:19,171 --> 01:24:21,100
If you do your full,
if you mean if you're 18 years old,

2263
01:24:21,101 --> 01:24:22,810
you've got it all figured out and get 
the fuck out of here.

2264
01:24:25,020 --> 01:24:26,950
That own apartment.
I was like 15,

2265
01:24:27,330 --> 01:24:28,240
right?
So I was like,

2266
01:24:28,570 --> 01:24:31,120
not my problem when I was 15 and was 
like,

2267
01:24:31,121 --> 01:24:31,970
uh,
I was a,

2268
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:35,700
we call it when you are living in the 
place you're squatting in a sense.

2269
01:24:36,010 --> 01:24:36,820
But you know,
I was like,

2270
01:24:36,910 --> 01:24:40,270
I've been on my own all my life.
A friend of mine's just Robinson said to

2271
01:24:40,271 --> 01:24:40,930
me one day,
he said,

2272
01:24:40,931 --> 01:24:41,380
you know,
Jack,

2273
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:45,130
you basically been making your own 
decisions since she was a kid,

2274
01:24:45,970 --> 01:24:49,060
but now you understand yourself better.
I didn't know who the fuck I was.

2275
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:50,710
Right?
I didn't know who I was.

2276
01:24:50,711 --> 01:24:55,711
I was just knew that I was living.
But going through all the bad times,

2277
01:24:56,231 --> 01:25:01,231
I think it's probably what has made your
character so strong today and now that 

2278
01:25:01,231 --> 01:25:04,861
everything's good,
you you understand the importance of 

2279
01:25:04,861 --> 01:25:07,771
keeping it good.
That's why this positive message that 

2280
01:25:07,771 --> 01:25:07,771
you keep pumping out.

2281
01:25:07,771 --> 01:25:07,940
And that's why this.
Let's go chat.

2282
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:11,290
I'm one step away from.
I'm one step away,

2283
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:15,670
a fruit punch from not feeling good.
I went to Roscoe's yesterday,

2284
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:18,970
you know,
great for getting waffles and I had a.

2285
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:21,100
I took a sip of the.
What's it called?

2286
01:25:21,430 --> 01:25:22,780
Eliminate Sunrise.
I don't know.

2287
01:25:22,781 --> 01:25:25,950
The fruit punch and sugary shit got me 
thinking bad.

2288
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:26,830
I was like,
Oh man,

2289
01:25:26,831 --> 01:25:29,200
I feel terrible.
Like so again,

2290
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:31,390
I say that you say I want a path and 
that's the great power.

2291
01:25:31,540 --> 01:25:36,310
But so is so crucial.
Diet's important.

2292
01:25:36,610 --> 01:25:38,220
Who I'm around.
It's important.

2293
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:43,460
You feel what I'm saying?
Because that's the energy you feel me 

2294
01:25:43,460 --> 01:25:43,460
and I'm around somebody doing some 
negative shit.

2295
01:25:43,460 --> 01:25:48,420
I'm not on that.
So I don't need to be around this 

2296
01:25:48,420 --> 01:25:50,821
person.
I don't even listen to like that much 

2297
01:25:50,821 --> 01:25:50,821
hip hop.
I listen to beats.

2298
01:25:50,821 --> 01:25:52,070
I don't eat because I don't want to hear
you drinking,

2299
01:25:52,310 --> 01:25:52,740
smoking.

2300
01:25:52,970 --> 01:25:55,570
You want to screw this girl,
you this shoot that you got this,

2301
01:25:55,660 --> 01:25:57,380
you got this car.
I got the watch.

2302
01:25:57,381 --> 01:25:59,800
I don't need that chip.
I already went through that and that was

2303
01:25:59,801 --> 01:26:04,801
a bad portion of my life.
The nineties is something that I wish 

2304
01:26:04,801 --> 01:26:04,801
never had.
The Guy,

2305
01:26:04,801 --> 01:26:06,680
I can't remember.
The name isn't until four years ago.

2306
01:26:06,681 --> 01:26:09,090
I don't feel like I was alive.
Wow.

2307
01:26:09,130 --> 01:26:10,520
Yeah.
I don't feel like I was lying and that's

2308
01:26:10,521 --> 01:26:12,170
credit to my,
to my family,

2309
01:26:12,171 --> 01:26:13,280
man,
my wife and kids,

2310
01:26:13,281 --> 01:26:14,450
man,
they really helped me down.

2311
01:26:14,570 --> 01:26:16,670
I'm crazy channel.
I'm not just saying no act.

2312
01:26:16,671 --> 01:26:21,671
I'm really.
I've been through some shit so I been 

2313
01:26:21,671 --> 01:26:21,671
through some shit.
Man.

2314
01:26:21,671 --> 01:26:24,730
You know what is on that crazy music you
play in the background that's just beats

2315
01:26:24,740 --> 01:26:27,050
tramp shout out to the plow.
Lord o g tags.

2316
01:26:27,051 --> 01:26:29,660
It was just beats Krazy k,
all the people,

2317
01:26:29,661 --> 01:26:30,050
man.

2318
01:26:30,050 --> 01:26:31,190
You know what I'm saying?
Courtney,

2319
01:26:31,191 --> 01:26:32,390
Scott,
all the people.

2320
01:26:32,391 --> 01:26:35,180
She's a female from La makes beats.
She's amazing.

2321
01:26:35,450 --> 01:26:38,030
I mean this is these.
I had to like do a detox,

2322
01:26:38,270 --> 01:26:40,160
like I don't watch certain things.
Television,

2323
01:26:40,161 --> 01:26:41,150
you know,
you flicking the channel.

2324
01:26:41,151 --> 01:26:43,720
What you got first 48,
a lockup.

2325
01:26:43,790 --> 01:26:45,780
You got negativity news.
I don't.

2326
01:26:45,820 --> 01:26:48,080
I had to.
I had to do a detox from the news.

2327
01:26:48,081 --> 01:26:49,580
Lately.
I don't watch anymore news.

2328
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:53,330
The presidential election.
All this shit is going crazy.

2329
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:58,450
I don't want to be involved in on 
because I'm involved with something 

2330
01:26:58,450 --> 01:26:58,450
else.
Roxanne,

2331
01:26:58,450 --> 01:27:00,410
I'm focused on Lucas Brown.
I can't focus on trump and hilary.

2332
01:27:00,590 --> 01:27:03,530
I got focused on Shannon breaks and me 
and Lucas locking ass.

2333
01:27:03,740 --> 01:27:08,740
Whenever we get a date you feel me.
So I've learned to like put things in 

2334
01:27:08,740 --> 01:27:13,031
perspective for you.
I can't watch the internet and watch so 

2335
01:27:13,031 --> 01:27:16,451
much brutal knockout videos and this 
girl is doing that in this guy I don't 

2336
01:27:16,451 --> 01:27:16,451
need to be involved with that.

2337
01:27:16,490 --> 01:27:21,490
I had and that's what a lot of people 
need to learn and they and a lot of 

2338
01:27:21,490 --> 01:27:22,280
people follow me or kids and they say 
thanks champ.

2339
01:27:23,030 --> 01:27:28,030
Because once I see the most damaging 
thing right now and America around the 

2340
01:27:28,030 --> 01:27:30,890
world for get that around the world is 
that kids don't have guidance.

2341
01:27:31,670 --> 01:27:33,890
You know what I mean?
So they got uncle champ.

2342
01:27:33,950 --> 01:27:35,060
You feel me?
Some kids,

2343
01:27:35,090 --> 01:27:36,920
thousands of kids hit me like you're 
like a dad to me,

2344
01:27:36,921 --> 01:27:37,850
man.
You know what I mean?

2345
01:27:37,940 --> 01:27:39,650
I didn't have a data.
Have a role model.

2346
01:27:39,770 --> 01:27:42,260
I didn't have nothing.
So they looked at my videos were days.

2347
01:27:42,261 --> 01:27:43,490
I don't want to make videos.
Joe,

2348
01:27:43,790 --> 01:27:45,320
I get text chat.
You okay?

2349
01:27:47,540 --> 01:27:48,260
You okay?
Chad,

2350
01:27:48,261 --> 01:27:49,580
we haven't heard from you in a couple of
days.

2351
01:27:49,581 --> 01:27:54,581
So I have a responsibility now to help 
others make them feel happy by being 

2352
01:27:54,581 --> 01:27:56,270
happy sometimes when I don't even feel 
happy.

2353
01:27:56,790 --> 01:27:58,670
But I think one of the things you're 
saying it's really important that you're

2354
01:27:58,671 --> 01:28:01,370
talking about a mental diet as well as a
physical 100 percent.

2355
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:04,430
And I think you really do have a mental 
diet and if you just take it,

2356
01:28:04,431 --> 01:28:07,490
nothing but negative things all day and 
around negative people.

2357
01:28:07,610 --> 01:28:12,610
And especially when you just expose 
yourself to 7 billion people's worth of 

2358
01:28:12,610 --> 01:28:16,151
news.
And the only stuff that gets popular as 

2359
01:28:16,151 --> 01:28:16,151
and stuff that's fucked up.
Nasty Shit Bro.

2360
01:28:16,151 --> 01:28:17,150
Fuck with your head.
Nasty.

2361
01:28:17,151 --> 01:28:22,151
I mean it really not forget your head 
because then it physically started 

2362
01:28:22,151 --> 01:28:23,660
feeling like,
I felt so crazy with this election.

2363
01:28:23,661 --> 01:28:25,070
You know what I'm saying?
Like physically,

2364
01:28:25,071 --> 01:28:25,910
I was like,
man.

2365
01:28:26,130 --> 01:28:27,470
I was like,
you know what?

2366
01:28:27,471 --> 01:28:29,030
That's it.
I came home and said,

2367
01:28:29,031 --> 01:28:29,960
that shit no more.
I said,

2368
01:28:29,961 --> 01:28:30,780
I told my wife.
I said No.

2369
01:28:30,781 --> 01:28:31,550
I said No.
I said,

2370
01:28:31,580 --> 01:28:33,560
please do me a favor if you want to 
watch this stuff,

2371
01:28:33,590 --> 01:28:38,590
do me a favor,
please just Tivo it and watch it when 

2372
01:28:38,590 --> 01:28:38,590
the champs on around.
Because I can't.

2373
01:28:38,590 --> 01:28:39,950
It's really me because I got to worry 
about training.

2374
01:28:40,120 --> 01:28:41,510
Right?
I gotta think I gotta think about that.

2375
01:28:41,511 --> 01:28:42,620
I don't want to be worried about what 
they,

2376
01:28:42,770 --> 01:28:44,750
what they do happen.
Gonna Happen.

2377
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:45,910
You know what?
I ain't gonna you don't,

2378
01:28:45,911 --> 01:28:47,300
it's going to affect me or it's not 
gonna affect me.

2379
01:28:47,301 --> 01:28:52,301
I'm going to deal with that then.
But right now I've got to focus on me 

2380
01:28:52,301 --> 01:28:52,301
and that's what I couldn't do.
Champ.

2381
01:28:52,301 --> 01:28:53,180
And I don't,
I don't blame anybody,

2382
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:54,890
but if you out there on prescription 
drugs,

2383
01:28:55,130 --> 01:29:00,130
I was taking all types of inhalers all 
my life since I promise team from early 

2384
01:29:01,070 --> 01:29:01,350
days kids.

2385
01:29:01,530 --> 01:29:06,530
That stuff is bad for you.
Mentally chat isn't bad for you 

2386
01:29:06,530 --> 01:29:06,530
mentally,
man.

2387
01:29:06,530 --> 01:29:07,680
What does it do for a man?
The anxiety,

2388
01:29:07,681 --> 01:29:08,910
the Judas,
the brain,

2389
01:29:09,150 --> 01:29:11,310
the chemistry,
the what it does to your brain,

2390
01:29:11,311 --> 01:29:12,960
man.
It alters it champ.

2391
01:29:13,230 --> 01:29:15,540
All you got to be careful not to take 
your medicine.

2392
01:29:15,541 --> 01:29:20,541
Follow your doctors.
I'm not telling you you don't listen to 

2393
01:29:20,541 --> 01:29:20,541
doctors,
but me personally,

2394
01:29:20,541 --> 01:29:25,220
I had to go on a journey to find out how
to save me because I went to every 

2395
01:29:25,220 --> 01:29:30,141
doctor.
They don't know anything about hormones 

2396
01:29:30,141 --> 01:29:30,390
and this and that.
They don't know anything.

2397
01:29:30,450 --> 01:29:35,450
They don't know how you.
I heard you once say you want to find 

2398
01:29:35,450 --> 01:29:38,670
about your hormones.
It's a super old doctor that looks 

2399
01:29:38,670 --> 01:29:41,301
great,
that knows about this type of shit 

2400
01:29:41,301 --> 01:29:42,810
because when you're feeling depressed 
and your testosterone is like 80 or 20,

2401
01:29:43,170 --> 01:29:44,660
you feel like killing yourself champ.

2402
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:50,060
You've got to do something.
People can't give you a bunch of pills 

2403
01:29:50,060 --> 01:29:50,190
and say,
this will make you feel better.

2404
01:29:50,310 --> 01:29:52,110
It's because you're still going to have 
low test,

2405
01:29:52,260 --> 01:29:54,930
which for a man is gonna,
make you feel like a bitch.

2406
01:29:55,380 --> 01:29:56,940
Excuse my language,
but it's just a fact.

2407
01:29:57,120 --> 01:30:00,000
So all these different factors play a 
role.

2408
01:30:00,090 --> 01:30:02,010
And also again,
back to what you're saying,

2409
01:30:02,130 --> 01:30:03,750
what you're watching,
the mental diet.

2410
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:06,750
If you're watching people getting killed
all day,

2411
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:12,440
you're gonna feel a certain way.
It's all this shit is going on in your 

2412
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:15,021
brain and your mental stores.
You feel me and now you're just 

2413
01:30:15,021 --> 01:30:15,021
wondering why.
Then you're eating sugar.

2414
01:30:15,021 --> 01:30:16,710
He eating cookies and donuts and fast 
food and Chinese food.

2415
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:20,580
This shit ain't helping you weave the 
champ and that's what I'm telling people

2416
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:21,480
everyday,
champ,

2417
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:23,150
leave it alone.
It's too tempting.

2418
01:30:23,170 --> 01:30:24,660
Everywhere you go,
you see fast food.

2419
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:26,730
Take take the food home and cook it 
yourself.

2420
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:30,150
We've got to try to bet and it's not in.
The problem is it's not cheap,

2421
01:30:30,540 --> 01:30:32,340
but we can afford to go to whole foods 
every day,

2422
01:30:32,370 --> 01:30:33,570
right?
You know what I'm saying?

2423
01:30:33,571 --> 01:30:35,580
Who can ice hard?
I'm struggling.

2424
01:30:36,060 --> 01:30:39,270
Who can afford every day to spend $150,
$20 for their family a day,

2425
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:41,160
every day.
That shit is hard chat.

2426
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:43,100
I think what you're saying is very 
important.

2427
01:30:43,150 --> 01:30:48,150
Very,
very important about a mental and a 

2428
01:30:48,150 --> 01:30:48,150
physical diet.
That is.

2429
01:30:48,150 --> 01:30:51,310
It's the same thing in that like when 
you watch it all the violence on 

2430
01:30:51,310 --> 01:30:51,800
television or all the negative news,
it's like sugar.

2431
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:54,650
Very compelling and to take in and for 
you.

2432
01:30:55,010 --> 01:31:00,010
Well,
I had that sugar drink last night and I 

2433
01:31:00,010 --> 01:31:00,010
was like,
because I'm not used to it.

2434
01:31:00,010 --> 01:31:00,380
Right?
And I was like,

2435
01:31:00,381 --> 01:31:01,430
I was feeling.
I was like,

2436
01:31:01,431 --> 01:31:02,150
Yo,
chill.

2437
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:05,880
This is what people drinking every day,
all day every day.

2438
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:08,060
And I was happy.
I was.

2439
01:31:08,070 --> 01:31:10,460
I able to do it now I can't take a sip.

2440
01:31:11,110 --> 01:31:13,420
It's crazy how your body adjusts your 
body,

2441
01:31:13,570 --> 01:31:16,450
your body adapts to not having sugar and
feeling healthy.

2442
01:31:16,451 --> 01:31:18,890
And then when you do have something 
that's unhealthy you,

2443
01:31:18,980 --> 01:31:23,980
you feel it.
Like you really feel deep in your body 

2444
01:31:23,980 --> 01:31:24,810
and your mood change me,
I crashed.

2445
01:31:24,830 --> 01:31:29,830
Yeah man.
I had a cheeseburger and a milkshake 

2446
01:31:29,830 --> 01:31:33,060
man,
and it was like somebody hit me with a 

2447
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:33,060
tranquilizer dart.
I felt terrible telling you,

2448
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:33,060
bro,
it's crazy.

2449
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:35,080
Before I would eat that and it'd be 
nothing crazy,

2450
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:39,790
but I think what you're saying I think 
is very important for people to take in.

2451
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:44,880
You know,
and having a person like you who's 

2452
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:47,131
experienced these great highs and lows 
and then come out of it with this 

2453
01:31:47,131 --> 01:31:47,850
positive energy.
That is that.

2454
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:52,900
That is so powerful for people.
That's such a motivational thing for 

2455
01:31:52,900 --> 01:31:53,080
other people though,
man.

2456
01:31:53,140 --> 01:31:54,220
There's no other way.
Yeah.

2457
01:31:54,250 --> 01:31:57,040
As much as you are helping yourself and 
I know you're helping yourself,

2458
01:31:57,041 --> 01:31:58,540
you're helping a lot of people,
man.

2459
01:31:58,541 --> 01:31:59,980
You really helping each other

2460
01:32:00,430 --> 01:32:01,300
helping each other.
I mean,

2461
01:32:01,301 --> 01:32:06,301
honestly,
there's nothing I said from the 

2462
01:32:06,301 --> 01:32:06,301
beginning that this ain't mine.
Are Patented.

2463
01:32:06,301 --> 01:32:10,580
Trademark the name.
I mean I trademarked the same and 

2464
01:32:10,580 --> 01:32:10,710
everything you trademark.
Let's go chat to try and go to.

2465
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:12,870
Let's go back.
Had to,

2466
01:32:12,910 --> 01:32:15,010
you know,
I had so many ups and downs.

2467
01:32:15,011 --> 01:32:16,570
Like I told you when I tell you no lie 
bro,

2468
01:32:16,571 --> 01:32:21,571
I got nothing to lie to you about.
I was involved with some major deals 

2469
01:32:21,571 --> 01:32:25,530
when I'm talking about from at the top 
in the beginning and in business and 

2470
01:32:25,530 --> 01:32:28,630
entertainment and the champion come out 
on the good side.

2471
01:32:28,631 --> 01:32:31,720
So a lot of times,
a lot of times enough to say damn,

2472
01:32:31,721 --> 01:32:33,370
I already am,
I stupid or something like,

2473
01:32:33,550 --> 01:32:38,550
but you don't just trust and belief and 
getting shot at champs and dirty 

2474
01:32:38,550 --> 01:32:42,100
business,
dirty game show and it's been dirty for 

2475
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:43,330
businesses,
all businesses.

2476
01:32:43,660 --> 01:32:45,530
So that's what I learned in and you 
know,

2477
01:32:45,550 --> 01:32:50,290
coming out where I am now and you know,
I trademarked it because I said,

2478
01:32:50,291 --> 01:32:52,330
you know what it was,
it was starting to like,

2479
01:32:52,331 --> 01:32:52,990
you know,
physical.

2480
01:32:52,991 --> 01:32:55,390
When I was like,
I was really passionate about it because

2481
01:32:55,540 --> 01:33:00,540
it's something that I was saying again,
I have nobody around me to whites to 

2482
01:33:00,540 --> 01:33:00,970
have friends with me all the time.
I'm training,

2483
01:33:00,971 --> 01:33:01,510
whatever,
whatever.

2484
01:33:01,630 --> 01:33:03,400
They all left.
It was always moved on.

2485
01:33:03,401 --> 01:33:06,670
So for me I was like no entourage,
nobody to push me.

2486
01:33:07,140 --> 01:33:09,820
I've got to push myself.
So I started talking to myself something

2487
01:33:09,821 --> 01:33:12,070
that I ever did and that's a whole 
nother story.

2488
01:33:12,071 --> 01:33:14,890
I'm gonna tell you in the book why I 
refused to talk to myself.

2489
01:33:15,310 --> 01:33:19,680
Why does your friends tell me I was 
saving it for Book Chalky,

2490
01:33:19,681 --> 01:33:21,820
but I'm still really sell the book man.

2491
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:23,850
Let me know.
Put up links.

2492
01:33:23,860 --> 01:33:25,010
I let people know,
right?

2493
01:33:25,011 --> 01:33:27,010
Well I'm buying myself if we go in that 
route,

2494
01:33:27,011 --> 01:33:27,880
that already they'll come on.
No,

2495
01:33:27,890 --> 01:33:28,480
no,
no.

2496
01:33:28,481 --> 01:33:30,370
The reason why is because um,
I had an uncle,

2497
01:33:30,371 --> 01:33:34,000
my mother's brother Anthony part hand,
he was her only brother.

2498
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:37,090
He went to the military.
He went to the Vietnam war as a child,

2499
01:33:37,091 --> 01:33:37,840
you know,
as a young man,

2500
01:33:37,841 --> 01:33:39,130
18 years old.
When he left high school,

2501
01:33:39,131 --> 01:33:42,840
he didn't have to because it was all 
sisters and he wanted to be Kogi.

2502
01:33:43,030 --> 01:33:44,860
He wanted to go because everyone in 
town,

2503
01:33:44,890 --> 01:33:45,580
Petersburg,
Virginia,

2504
01:33:45,670 --> 01:33:46,690
excuse me,
Jarret,

2505
01:33:46,691 --> 01:33:48,760
Virginia,
everybody from his town,

2506
01:33:48,820 --> 01:33:50,920
the young men were going his own cousins
and everybody.

2507
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:52,900
So he went,
he came back,

2508
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:55,720
I'm disturbed.
He came back,

2509
01:33:55,740 --> 01:33:57,130
you know,
different than when he went in.

2510
01:33:57,131 --> 01:34:02,131
He was actually missing for quite a time
that we could declare him dead when he 

2511
01:34:02,131 --> 01:34:03,620
showed up one day,
um,

2512
01:34:04,510 --> 01:34:06,710
with a trench coat on army boots and 
neck it.

2513
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:07,940
Whoa,
whoa.

2514
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Easy street in Brooklyn.
So this led to him being mentally 

2515
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,890
disturbed all my life.
He would talk to himself.

2516
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:16,020
He lived with us.
I,

2517
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:21,200
I slept in a twin bed here and he slept 
in the bed there and he was with 

2518
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:22,960
alcohol.
He drank.

2519
01:34:22,961 --> 01:34:24,930
He became very violent,
you know,

2520
01:34:24,940 --> 01:34:27,490
he beat my mom up one time.
Really bad colds.

2521
01:34:27,491 --> 01:34:32,491
I had eyes on him talking to himself,
but something I grew up all my life 

2522
01:34:32,491 --> 01:34:34,020
watching and I'm like,
ain't me crazy.

2523
01:34:34,021 --> 01:34:34,860
You called amy,
amy,

2524
01:34:34,870 --> 01:34:35,490
you crazy.
Okay.

2525
01:34:35,540 --> 01:34:38,830
You told me to itself so.
And I got older.

2526
01:34:38,890 --> 01:34:41,950
I would just refuse to even have a 
conversation with myself.

2527
01:34:41,980 --> 01:34:42,810
Oh,
you're crazy if you.

2528
01:34:43,090 --> 01:34:46,330
And four years ago I started having 
conversations with myself.

2529
01:34:46,700 --> 01:34:47,680
I was like,
Yo,

2530
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:48,850
you know what,
champ,

2531
01:34:49,030 --> 01:34:51,040
you got to go.
And I start saying,

2532
01:34:51,041 --> 01:34:52,240
let's go champ.
And I was like,

2533
01:34:52,270 --> 01:34:53,470
ma'am,
I asked my wife.

2534
01:34:53,470 --> 01:34:54,250
I said,
you think I'm crazy?

2535
01:34:54,251 --> 01:34:55,570
Because I spoke.
She was like,

2536
01:34:55,700 --> 01:34:56,590
Oh yeah,
we already know.

2537
01:34:56,591 --> 01:34:57,680
You're crazy.
Know what I mean?

2538
01:34:58,220 --> 01:34:59,640
So I'm like,
let's go you.

2539
01:35:00,270 --> 01:35:02,420
And that was my mantra.
It became a mantra.

2540
01:35:02,421 --> 01:35:04,730
You know,
my friend told me one of his mantras was

2541
01:35:05,510 --> 01:35:06,950
to be the man,
you've got to be the man.

2542
01:35:08,330 --> 01:35:11,120
When he was tired,
he was running mile 18 to be the man.

2543
01:35:11,121 --> 01:35:13,220
You've got to be the man,
be the man.

2544
01:35:13,221 --> 01:35:15,150
You got to be the man I'm going to say 
to himself.

2545
01:35:15,380 --> 01:35:20,380
And I was like,
you know why they the mantra and I was 

2546
01:35:20,380 --> 01:35:20,840
hitting the bag one day and I was tired.
I was like 400 pounds.

2547
01:35:20,841 --> 01:35:24,040
I was like,
let's go champ champ.

2548
01:35:26,260 --> 01:35:28,130
You know,
and it's in the head champ.

2549
01:35:28,190 --> 01:35:29,360
You know,
when I'm feeling pain,

2550
01:35:29,361 --> 01:35:30,860
you're feeling pain,
you're feeling down,

2551
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:32,300
tell yourself,
let's go champ.

2552
01:35:32,870 --> 01:35:34,910
Let's go chat to what I hear you when I 
work out.

2553
01:35:34,911 --> 01:35:38,240
Sometimes it's yours.
I shouldn't push them through a set.

2554
01:35:38,300 --> 01:35:39,710
It's yours,
it's yours.

2555
01:35:39,740 --> 01:35:41,390
It's everybody's.
It's the people's man,

2556
01:35:41,391 --> 01:35:43,100
the people.
The people gave me this.

2557
01:35:43,340 --> 01:35:45,260
The universe gave me this.
The people,

2558
01:35:45,350 --> 01:35:47,480
the people linked into it and it's not 
mine.

2559
01:35:47,481 --> 01:35:52,481
It's ours,
we just want to give each other 

2560
01:35:52,481 --> 01:35:52,481
positivity and love and I meet people 
from everywhere.

2561
01:35:52,481 --> 01:35:56,520
China.
I'm a little nuts because I go to every 

2562
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:56,520
city or country and people say,
chair,

2563
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:56,520
but I'm in the lobby or I'm in this 
time,

2564
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:57,280
can I meet you?
And I said,

2565
01:35:57,281 --> 01:36:00,500
come over to the hotel and they come.
They come.

2566
01:36:00,501 --> 01:36:05,501
I mean,
you might have to stop that when you 

2567
01:36:05,501 --> 01:36:05,501
went to people.

2568
01:36:05,501 --> 01:36:05,501
I'm the people's champ.
I'm fair.

2569
01:36:05,501 --> 01:36:06,920
I'm here for the people.
Wow Man,

2570
01:36:06,921 --> 01:36:08,270
that's strong.
But listen,

2571
01:36:08,271 --> 01:36:09,570
if you can motivate yourself,
you can.

2572
01:36:09,710 --> 01:36:11,420
I mean,
you motivate other people.

2573
01:36:11,421 --> 01:36:13,340
You should definitely be able to 
motivate yourself as well.

2574
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:15,200
I'm not trying going to be honest with 
you.

2575
01:36:15,380 --> 01:36:18,500
I'm not trying to like say I'm a guru.
I'm a motivator.

2576
01:36:18,501 --> 01:36:23,501
I'm just a dude who is showing people 
that I was down and out.

2577
01:36:23,750 --> 01:36:27,010
I was flat on my face.
I wanted to kill myself and I gave.

2578
01:36:27,050 --> 01:36:30,200
I didn't give up for the love of my 
family and the love of the people.

2579
01:36:30,201 --> 01:36:31,580
That's pr.
That's Sam.

2580
01:36:31,581 --> 01:36:32,840
Let's go champion that.
Believe in me.

2581
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:34,520
I want to do a full of them.
You need a reason,

2582
01:36:34,521 --> 01:36:35,270
you know,
unit purpose.

2583
01:36:35,271 --> 01:36:38,240
Got Her shout out to Scott Hirsch.
He told me a long time ago.

2584
01:36:38,241 --> 01:36:38,970
He said,
uh,

2585
01:36:39,170 --> 01:36:39,770
you know,
Shaney,

2586
01:36:39,771 --> 01:36:43,610
I think the family thing,
environment is just out the blue and the

2587
01:36:43,611 --> 01:36:44,200
conversation.

2588
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:44,700
He just said,
you know,

2589
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:46,760
Shana,
we wouldn't even talking about anything.

2590
01:36:46,761 --> 01:36:47,120
He said,
you know,

2591
01:36:47,121 --> 01:36:52,121
I just think the family,
the family plays a huge part of our 

2592
01:36:52,121 --> 01:36:52,121
development.
I said,

2593
01:36:52,121 --> 01:36:52,121
why you say that,
Scott?

2594
01:36:52,160 --> 01:36:53,930
He says,
because it gives you a reason to go home

2595
01:36:53,931 --> 01:36:55,340
at night.
And I was like,

2596
01:36:55,341 --> 01:36:55,850
Damn,
you know,

2597
01:36:55,851 --> 01:36:57,140
we all need a reason.
You know what I mean?

2598
01:36:57,160 --> 01:37:02,160
There's a reason and my family gives me 
a reason and you give me a reason 

2599
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:03,560
because when snoop dogg gave me a reason
to camera on,

2600
01:37:03,561 --> 01:37:08,561
gave me a reason every popular rapper 
and unpopular wrapper and guys who make 

2601
01:37:08,561 --> 01:37:09,380
beats,
they gave me a reason because champion,

2602
01:37:09,381 --> 01:37:10,220
feel good,
man.

2603
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:12,200
I'm a keep it real with you.
A lot of days I didn't feel good,

2604
01:37:12,201 --> 01:37:14,500
but when I got up and seen you,
what?

2605
01:37:14,501 --> 01:37:19,501
Snoop or cameron or reals or chance or 
anybody out there that I know that was 

2606
01:37:21,020 --> 01:37:23,110
gave me a shot out or did that,
uh,

2607
01:37:23,180 --> 01:37:25,010
you know,
actors to someone else.

2608
01:37:25,160 --> 01:37:30,160
I was like,
Dad gave me a reason and the reason it 

2609
01:37:30,160 --> 01:37:32,311
became more and more so I felt like I 
was taking an imagery from the people 

2610
01:37:32,311 --> 01:37:32,311
around the world.
Every,

2611
01:37:32,311 --> 01:37:34,190
every text,
every meme,

2612
01:37:34,220 --> 01:37:39,220
every,
every DM I feel I'm getting stronger 

2613
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:39,220
because now the people behind me,
I never had nothing.

2614
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:43,760
So I was on my own.
I was a kid by myself and now I've got 

2615
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:44,360
the world behind me.
That's all I needed.

2616
01:37:44,420 --> 01:37:46,280
You got a lot of people got the world 
champ.

2617
01:37:46,300 --> 01:37:48,620
I don't know.
I got 150 thanks to you as well.

2618
01:37:48,621 --> 01:37:51,630
And then everybody who promotes me and 
those are my promoters by the way.

2619
01:37:51,631 --> 01:37:53,290
The people promote me.
Thanks.

2620
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:56,310
So you guys got 157,000

2621
01:37:56,330 --> 01:37:57,000
people,
a hundred 50,

2622
01:37:57,001 --> 01:37:58,110
6,000
people following me.

2623
01:37:58,111 --> 01:37:59,530
Right.
That to me is unreal.

2624
01:37:59,531 --> 01:38:04,531
I started out with nine.
I remember when you talked about me on 

2625
01:38:04,531 --> 01:38:07,341
your instagram because we were talking 
about you and how much I love your 

2626
01:38:07,341 --> 01:38:07,341
videos.
I was like,

2627
01:38:07,341 --> 01:38:10,080
oh,
I'm excited.

2628
01:38:10,370 --> 01:38:13,170
This is excitement for me because I 
never had this.

2629
01:38:13,171 --> 01:38:15,690
I never had no momentum.
I never had nobody behind me.

2630
01:38:15,870 --> 01:38:17,280
I got a reason.
I feel like rocky.

2631
01:38:17,281 --> 01:38:19,350
You know what I'm saying?
Like keep fighting.

2632
01:38:19,351 --> 01:38:19,990
You know what I'm saying?
Hey,

2633
01:38:21,180 --> 01:38:23,300
I got a reason.
You know what I mean?

2634
01:38:23,310 --> 01:38:26,550
I got a reason.
I've never had a reason except to try to

2635
01:38:26,551 --> 01:38:29,820
make some money to feed myself and my 
family or to show off or get some shit.

2636
01:38:29,821 --> 01:38:30,900
You know what I'm saying?
So me,

2637
01:38:30,910 --> 01:38:33,380
vo reached type of situation.
Now I'm too.

2638
01:38:33,410 --> 01:38:34,530
I don't care about the money.

2639
01:38:34,710 --> 01:38:37,470
Of course I got to have the money.
Don't get me wrong and I want to be paid

2640
01:38:37,530 --> 01:38:42,120
accordingly.
I'm bringing non boxing fans to boxing.

2641
01:38:43,020 --> 01:38:48,020
That deserves something.
I told you when I fought Vitaly 

2642
01:38:48,020 --> 01:38:48,360
Klitschko,
they did the highest ratings ever,

2643
01:38:48,540 --> 01:38:50,610
not because of political,
because of shared and breaks.

2644
01:38:50,611 --> 01:38:55,611
He fought many people.
Why so many with me when I fought 

2645
01:38:55,611 --> 01:38:55,611
limits,
fluids,

2646
01:38:55,611 --> 01:38:56,370
highest ratings when I fought George 
Foreman,

2647
01:38:56,820 --> 01:38:58,050
George foreman,
highest ratings.

2648
01:38:58,200 --> 01:38:59,850
I sell champ.
Now.

2649
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:01,880
I want to be.
I want to be paid for that chip.

2650
01:39:01,890 --> 01:39:03,090
This is a job.
You know me.

2651
01:39:03,091 --> 01:39:04,800
I'm a mailman.
I get up everyday and go to work,

2652
01:39:04,950 --> 01:39:06,510
do my job,
but I want to be paid.

2653
01:39:06,540 --> 01:39:08,250
I didn't get paid when a forklift go,
champ.

2654
01:39:08,370 --> 01:39:10,110
I want to make money.
I'm not stupid.

2655
01:39:10,260 --> 01:39:11,490
You feel me?
I was,

2656
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:16,520
but I'm not your primary motivation.
My primary motivation is to.

2657
01:39:16,770 --> 01:39:21,330
People are behind me and I want to do 
something that never been gone.

2658
01:39:21,390 --> 01:39:25,080
I want to bring all these non boxing 
fans like Muhammad Ali did.

2659
01:39:25,410 --> 01:39:30,410
I wanted my Hammad lead moment,
not for me and for my ego because I 

2660
01:39:30,410 --> 01:39:30,720
don't have.
I cut the hill already.

2661
01:39:30,721 --> 01:39:32,220
I got a girl already.
I got a wife.

2662
01:39:32,221 --> 01:39:33,420
I don't care.
You know what I'm saying?

2663
01:39:33,570 --> 01:39:35,640
I don't care about clothes.
I don't want a Bentley.

2664
01:39:35,641 --> 01:39:37,680
I don't want to.
I don't care about that no more.

2665
01:39:37,740 --> 01:39:42,740
I don't want none of that.
I just want the people to say that make 

2666
01:39:45,361 --> 01:39:48,030
me feel good champ.
That'll make me feel good man.

2667
01:39:48,031 --> 01:39:49,230
And it make me feel like,
you know what,

2668
01:39:49,890 --> 01:39:53,040
my mom looking at me and she could say 
my part of my boy,

2669
01:39:53,070 --> 01:39:55,260
you feel me?
He made somebody nothing.

2670
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:56,550
You know,
we was homeless.

2671
01:39:57,030 --> 01:39:58,530
People turn their back on US champ.

2672
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:02,580
They wouldn't let us come in a place.
Many nights we sat on the train and many

2673
01:40:02,581 --> 01:40:04,200
nights I didn't know when she was alive 
or dead,

2674
01:40:04,430 --> 01:40:05,700
you know,
and I was hoping to just.

2675
01:40:05,940 --> 01:40:09,240
And it was rough man.
And I want her to look at me and say,

2676
01:40:09,241 --> 01:40:10,170
man,
my boy made it.

2677
01:40:10,380 --> 01:40:12,390
You know what I mean?
And she said something before she died.

2678
01:40:12,391 --> 01:40:12,990
She said,
Shannon,

2679
01:40:13,230 --> 01:40:15,360
when we lost everything,
people said,

2680
01:40:15,361 --> 01:40:16,590
you know,
she said she was like,

2681
01:40:16,591 --> 01:40:18,860
the big person in my family was supposed
to do something.

2682
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:23,310
This is all in the book,
but she was supposed to be something and

2683
01:40:23,340 --> 01:40:28,340
she got.
She came to New York and she was living 

2684
01:40:28,340 --> 01:40:28,810
in life and she was making a,
got a job and she got put on.

2685
01:40:28,830 --> 01:40:33,830
She got got on drugs and she went from a
beautiful woman to a woman who lost 

2686
01:40:34,381 --> 01:40:37,470
everything,
but she had a son and she took me sickly

2687
01:40:37,471 --> 01:40:39,600
and all stuck by my side,
so I said,

2688
01:40:39,601 --> 01:40:44,601
I'm gonna make it,
and she instilled in me making Shannon 

2689
01:40:44,601 --> 01:40:44,601
regardless of what you have to do,
make it.

2690
01:40:44,601 --> 01:40:46,650
And when people turned our back on us 
and we had nothing,

2691
01:40:46,651 --> 01:40:47,720
Joe,
she says,

2692
01:40:47,721 --> 01:40:52,721
Shannon,
one day we going to have something and 

2693
01:40:52,721 --> 01:40:52,721
they gonna look at us different,
you feel me?

2694
01:40:52,721 --> 01:40:54,040
And she said to me before died.
So I didn't make

2695
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:59,040
it,
but I made it through you and that's 

2696
01:40:59,040 --> 01:40:59,240
what I'm doing is for because she made 
it because she gave me.

2697
01:40:59,350 --> 01:41:02,130
She made it her son and she doesn't want
me to give up asthma.

2698
01:41:02,140 --> 01:41:04,120
Ain't no excuse.
No manager.

2699
01:41:04,121 --> 01:41:05,710
Ain't no excuse,
no promoter.

2700
01:41:05,711 --> 01:41:10,711
Ain't no excuse.
Make it until I came out with social 

2701
01:41:10,711 --> 01:41:13,741
media.
They can on social media and I'm making 

2702
01:41:13,741 --> 01:41:13,741
the champ.
When you making a lot of people happy to

2703
01:41:13,790 --> 01:41:15,400
thank you.
A lot of excitement,

2704
01:41:15,980 --> 01:41:18,370
a lot of motivation,
a lot of enthusiasm.

2705
01:41:18,530 --> 01:41:21,340
Me,
I'm in your corner corner.

2706
01:41:21,770 --> 01:41:23,170
Thank you chairman.
Thank you for being.

2707
01:41:25,740 --> 01:41:28,450
This is a.
I'm sorry to cut you off.

2708
01:41:28,620 --> 01:41:29,340
No,
nothing.

2709
01:41:29,350 --> 01:41:31,090
I'm just saying I had a great fucking 
time talking to you.

2710
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:36,360
This has been therapeutic for me.
More importantly because I didn't need 

2711
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:39,190
to vent because no one's been able to 
give me a outlet.

2712
01:41:39,350 --> 01:41:40,450
No SPEC.
Normally.

2713
01:41:40,520 --> 01:41:45,520
This big has given me an opportunity to 
talk to so many people and I wish I 

2714
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:45,760
could've done this totally different 
now.

2715
01:41:46,530 --> 01:41:49,030
Perfect.
This is perfect.

2716
01:41:49,090 --> 01:41:50,200
I started out a little,
you know,

2717
01:41:50,201 --> 01:41:51,340
tripping up,
but it's all good.

2718
01:41:51,341 --> 01:41:51,790
Champ.
You know.

2719
01:41:51,791 --> 01:41:56,791
Um,
this is a moment from your life because 

2720
01:41:56,791 --> 01:41:56,791
forget the past.
I don't even remember.

2721
01:41:56,791 --> 01:41:58,120
I got,
I got some type of damage.

2722
01:41:58,121 --> 01:41:59,530
I don't ever killed.
Remember this shit.

2723
01:41:59,770 --> 01:42:00,730
This right.
This moment,

2724
01:42:00,731 --> 01:42:02,230
right now is the moment,
man.

2725
01:42:02,231 --> 01:42:03,190
I'm in the moment,
man.

2726
01:42:03,191 --> 01:42:05,830
I'm in the moment and I appreciate it 
because it means a lot to me,

2727
01:42:05,831 --> 01:42:07,630
man,
because I was flat.

2728
01:42:07,630 --> 01:42:10,000
They nobody wanted to get me nothing.
Nobody gave me a shot.

2729
01:42:10,001 --> 01:42:12,000
I couldn't get a tee shirt called 
everlasting sent man.

2730
01:42:12,001 --> 01:42:13,090
Let me get a tee shirt.
It said no.

2731
01:42:13,091 --> 01:42:16,150
Call Back Man,
don't go here with that shit.

2732
01:42:16,160 --> 01:42:18,340
Shit.
I couldn't get nothing from nobody,

2733
01:42:18,341 --> 01:42:19,600
man.
I don't want nothing from nobody.

2734
01:42:19,601 --> 01:42:20,380
You what I'm saying,
Oh,

2735
01:42:20,381 --> 01:42:23,040
I want to do is be successful.
You know,

2736
01:42:23,650 --> 01:42:26,020
have something for my family when I'm 
gone.

2737
01:42:26,350 --> 01:42:31,350
You know what I'm saying?
So they don't have to suffer the way I 

2738
01:42:31,350 --> 01:42:31,760
did and I want to make people laugh and 
make people have fun and be so.

2739
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:33,820
Leave my fight to say,
man,

2740
01:42:33,880 --> 01:42:35,380
he did it.
Then I'm going to do it again.

2741
01:42:35,470 --> 01:42:36,560
That's another thing.
Before I go,

2742
01:42:36,580 --> 01:42:38,500
I want to say this.
I want to fight a lot.

2743
01:42:39,220 --> 01:42:41,380
I want the heavyweight championship 
fight three,

2744
01:42:41,381 --> 01:42:42,910
four,
five times a year.

2745
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:45,280
I don't believe in this fight.
Two years.

2746
01:42:45,460 --> 01:42:48,010
He should fight every fight,
every fight,

2747
01:42:48,190 --> 01:42:49,930
every six weeks.
That champion,

2748
01:42:50,590 --> 01:42:55,590
yes.
That's what should be happening and 

2749
01:42:55,590 --> 01:42:55,590
that's what I want.
I want to be an active campaign.

2750
01:42:55,590 --> 01:42:56,050
Now.
I'll give that to wilder.

2751
01:42:56,051 --> 01:42:58,960
They did keep them busy before he,
before he hurt his arm,

2752
01:42:59,140 --> 01:43:04,140
they kept him busy.
But that's how you're supposed to fight 

2753
01:43:04,140 --> 01:43:04,140
the game.
Be Busy,

2754
01:43:04,140 --> 01:43:06,310
be busy half for bringing more people to
the sport and then walk away.
