1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,863
Struggle,

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,820
all right,
ladies and gentlemen would live the

3
00:00:09,821 --> 00:00:12,850
presidents now blind spend staring at
the sun all day trying to see the

4
00:00:12,851 --> 00:00:14,290
eclipse.
There's photos of it.

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,740
Mike Baker help us out.
What?

6
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:18,100
What are we doing,
man?

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:19,270
Well,
Dahlia,

8
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,470
that's probably,
again,

9
00:00:20,471 --> 00:00:20,941
it's,
it's,

10
00:00:20,941 --> 00:00:24,790
it's an indication that they don't have
a lot of discipline in that

11
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:25,421
Communications Department of the White
House.

12
00:00:25,421 --> 00:00:27,220
No one got him the message,
don't Sir Sir.

13
00:00:27,221 --> 00:00:28,930
Don't.
Don't look at the sun.

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,970
Not only that,
definitely don't look at the sun while

15
00:00:30,971 --> 00:00:33,730
people are looking at you,
Jesus Christ,

16
00:00:33,731 --> 00:00:36,810
the whole world is going to mock you.
Don't you know that everybody knows is

17
00:00:36,811 --> 00:00:37,930
since they were a kid,
right?

18
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,120
Even even if you've never been involved
in an eclipse,

19
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,460
every kid knows.
Don't look at the sun.

20
00:00:42,461 --> 00:00:45,460
It's the one thing that every child
learned somehow.

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,420
You know,
when I tried to do that,

22
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:49,660
I'm a fucking idiot.
I took a two dark sunglasses.

23
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:52,510
I put them on top of each other.
That'll where I put one pair and then I

24
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:54,820
put another layer over.
It doesn't work folks.

25
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,860
It looks good.
It does look good,

26
00:00:56,861 --> 00:00:58,440
but I only looked for a second and I
went,

27
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,170
oh,
okay,

28
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,120
this doesn't work,
but you know where I could look at it.

29
00:01:01,121 --> 00:01:03,550
I can look at it through my pool,
like the reflection.

30
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,260
Oh sure.
You'll see the eclipse,

31
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,050
but it never really got fully dark here.
No,

32
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,150
we're too low.
Yeah,

33
00:01:09,151 --> 00:01:10,180
we,
I just came down from,

34
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:14,470
from Idaho.
I was up there in the mountains over the

35
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:17,890
past few days and it was just,
it did just hippies coming in from left

36
00:01:17,891 --> 00:01:21,490
and right.
Tire state just overrun with the hippies

37
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,350
and they're,
I mean their parking and people's,

38
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:24,370
you know,
ranches,

39
00:01:24,371 --> 00:01:28,880
they just driving up on fields that have
just been planted there just like they

40
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:29,890
don't even think.

41
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,350
And so they.
But they kept my.

42
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:31,871
Yeah,
you know,

43
00:01:31,871 --> 00:01:34,720
hey God bless him.
I don't know that I was intellectually

44
00:01:34,721 --> 00:01:37,660
curious enough to really worry about the
eclipse.

45
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,940
There's a balance in.
You know what?

46
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:44,410
I think a lot of intellectual curiosity
is great and a lot of hippie values are

47
00:01:44,411 --> 00:01:46,870
great,
but then you go too far into the hippie

48
00:01:46,871 --> 00:01:51,871
retard gene pool and you get these dopey
hippies that are hippies that know

49
00:01:52,251 --> 00:01:55,690
they're the worst kind of hippies,
hippies that don't really want to do any

50
00:01:55,691 --> 00:01:58,380
work,
but they want universal basic income.

51
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,180
They want all of these.
These one percenters,

52
00:02:01,181 --> 00:02:05,500
they have plenty of money so that no one
should have to work ever.

53
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:09,130
They just passed it.
They passed a tax up in Seattle.

54
00:02:09,131 --> 00:02:10,930
It's gonna probably going to get struck
down,

55
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,340
but it basically,
it was up in Seattle,

56
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:13,360
will got blessed them up there.

57
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,210
They they've decided that they're going
to go against the state charter,

58
00:02:16,211 --> 00:02:18,930
which says you can't have a attacks,
right?

59
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,810
An income tax,
and they've gone ahead and done it for

60
00:02:22,811 --> 00:02:26,170
the.
I think it's for the top two percent.

61
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,160
The only tax that tax.
The tax people are doing something right

62
00:02:30,161 --> 00:02:32,380
because you know,
you gotta make this thing more

63
00:02:32,381 --> 00:02:33,940
equitable.
That's hilarious.

64
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,470
That's really funny.
Well,

65
00:02:35,471 --> 00:02:37,930
what's interesting is that's the whole
reason why a lot of companies like

66
00:02:37,931 --> 00:02:41,380
Amazon and Microsoft is the reason why
they've located to Seattle.

67
00:02:41,381 --> 00:02:44,860
You fucking stomachs and they're going
to pull out and then you wouldn't have

68
00:02:44,861 --> 00:02:49,861
any jobs and then you'll be poor.
Somebody is going to pay for that.

69
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,550
Yeah.
We came from,

70
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,790
we moved out from fairfield county,
from New Canaan,

71
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:58,590
Connecticut when we moved out to Idaho,
which was the world's greatest movie of

72
00:02:58,591 --> 00:02:59,950
all.
Connecticut.

73
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:00,370
Sucks.

74
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,940
I say it over and over again and.
But yeah,

75
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:04,940
I mean,
but they know it.

76
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:08,770
You better get Noah and then people,
but you live in a lucky spot and.

77
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:09,381
And they,
they,

78
00:03:09,381 --> 00:03:11,190
their plan,
the,

79
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,290
the,
the plan of the governor and the rest of

80
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:17,710
the crew there is when you need more
money tax,

81
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,260
fairfield county where I,
which is home to new Canaan and

82
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:24,580
Greenwich and Darien and Stanford.
The people that work in the city or the

83
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:27,040
people that are working in finance and
now what they've,

84
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,800
what they've had over the past three,
four years.

85
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,930
Ever since the governor's been running
the shop is people moving out.

86
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:38,440
I mean,
every GE moved out of General Electric,

87
00:03:38,441 --> 00:03:41,650
the entire operation with General
Electric said went to the state and

88
00:03:41,651 --> 00:03:42,730
said,
I know people will think of why are we

89
00:03:42,731 --> 00:03:45,340
talking about this?
But they went to the State House and

90
00:03:45,341 --> 00:03:47,050
they said,
you can't keep doing this.

91
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,680
You can't keep jacking it up on us to
pay for everything.

92
00:03:50,681 --> 00:03:52,780
We're happy to pay and we are apparent,
our fair share.

93
00:03:52,781 --> 00:03:54,520
But so they did that in general.
Like you said,

94
00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:55,970
we're going to move.
The state didn't believe him.

95
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:58,450
They've all relocated to Boston.
Um,

96
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,610
they've got,
uh,

97
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,030
who else is moving to Aetna?
I think the,

98
00:04:02,031 --> 00:04:03,310
uh,
the large insurance company,

99
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,080
you know,
now Connecticut's known as sort of the

100
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:06,040
insurance capital,
right?

101
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,760
They're leaving hedge funds,
private equity groups moving down to

102
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:11,620
Florida.
And again,

103
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,500
great pay your fair share,
but at a certain point

104
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,350
everybody's got to contribute something.
You can't just say that's what you're

105
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,970
gonna do.
And I'm not in the one percent.

106
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:23,770
I wish I was.
It used to be when you were a kid,

107
00:04:23,771 --> 00:04:26,300
you wanted to be rich right now,
you know,

108
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,210
I don't know what people want.
They want to be in the middle.

109
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,610
You want to be comfortable.
That's where you want to be comfortable.

110
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:31,444
I,
I don't know,

111
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:34,230
I always thought it'd be pretty cool to
be wealthy and all and,

112
00:04:34,231 --> 00:04:35,470
and I think I'd be pretty good at it.

113
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,730
My friend Brian Cowen said it best once
and it stuck with me forever.

114
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,350
He said,
you know what you want to be.

115
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,140
You want to be to the point where you
don't have to worry about your bills and

116
00:04:43,141 --> 00:04:45,900
you can go to a restaurant and not worry
about what you order.

117
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,640
He goes,
everything other than that,

118
00:04:47,641 --> 00:04:48,340
it's bullshit.

119
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,031
Yeah.
Because everybody,

120
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:49,570
you know,
and that's,

121
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:50,950
that's a good point I guess because
that's,

122
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,770
you take that stress out of your life
and then I get,

123
00:04:53,771 --> 00:04:55,630
well I guess you're gonna worry about
it.

124
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,330
So people find it.
Yes.

125
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,380
Just stress and stress,
right?

126
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:02,770
I mean like look at these assholes that
buy these $500,000,000 yachts.

127
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,720
It's like they just realized like,
oh,

128
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,930
enough problems in my life.
I need to buy a fucking floating city.

129
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:11,160
And then I got,
I got to hire a crew of 100 to hate me,

130
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,920
talk shit about me.
Every time I turned my back they,

131
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,050
I want to fuck my wife,
dammit.

132
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:20,770
I'm going to get in line.
Bosens made finished.

133
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,450
Compost is made.
I know what I came up with.

134
00:05:22,451 --> 00:05:23,560
Bows.
And is that a real thing?

135
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,610
I think it is.
Yeah.

136
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,550
I think there was such thing as a
[inaudible] made this always like this

137
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:28,960
ebb and flow,
right?

138
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:32,710
I mean the people that have accumulated
too much wealth,

139
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:35,590
especially when it comes to like hedge
fund people and finance people.

140
00:05:35,591 --> 00:05:37,570
It's like,
what are you actually doing?

141
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,940
Right?
And you're using that money to influence

142
00:05:39,941 --> 00:05:43,810
policy and that policy allows you to
extract more money from the system and

143
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:46,720
it gets real slippery because
occasionally you guys fuck up and it

144
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,580
crashes the whole economy.
Right?

145
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,740
Like that kind of money is like really
creepy.

146
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:53,620
But when you're talking about someone
who's developed a legitimate product,

147
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,690
they sell it and they're successful,
they work hard.

148
00:05:55,691 --> 00:05:57,730
They made something.
Some does business.

149
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,310
Exactly.

150
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:58,730
Yeah.
Yeah.

151
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,330
The hiring people there,
you know there's a,

152
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:04,070
there's a house for sale up in the
Hamptons,

153
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:06,950
now there's a house for $175.
Million Dollars.

154
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,160
It seems logical.
Yeah.

155
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,250
One hundred and $75,000,000.
But you know what?

156
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:11,590
It's on the beach.
So it's,

157
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,600
it's got waterfront to it.
So I guess that explains the Price Tag.

158
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:16,070
But here's the thing about that water
fund.

159
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:17,930
Anybody can walk in front of your house.
Yeah,

160
00:06:17,931 --> 00:06:20,330
that's true.
That's a huge problem in Malibu.

161
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,300
There's this,
a couple of other I'm friends with and

162
00:06:23,301 --> 00:06:26,540
their sons surf and they live in Malibu.
They have a house in Malibu and they

163
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,460
were surfing in the water in front of
this house.

164
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,010
This guy comes out and yells and screams
at him,

165
00:06:31,011 --> 00:06:32,750
you know,
get the fuck off the beach because you

166
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:35,030
know,
a $10,000,000 house right there on the

167
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:36,320
beach.
And they're like,

168
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:37,130
what are you talking about?

169
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,960
Like we live right over there.
You piece of shit.

170
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,720
And like not only that,
anybody can be on this beach.

171
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,250
This is the ocean.
You can't,

172
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:47,690
you don't own the private beach signs up
and ate it and for the most part that's

173
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:48,950
true.
Up and the Hamilton,

174
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,990
I think this actually has some private
beach frontage,

175
00:06:50,991 --> 00:06:54,080
which again,
so $175 million seems somewhat

176
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,540
reasonable.
Hampton's most expensive home.

177
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,560
There it is right there.
One hundred and $75.

178
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,380
Got a lake,
a.

179
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,490
he's got a lake and then further past
the leg.

180
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,350
Wow.
They all have lakes.

181
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:09,500
What is that?
Is that freshwater or brackish water?

182
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,910
That must be brackish water,
right?

183
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,670
I guess.
I guess a pretty bad ass don't have fish

184
00:07:13,671 --> 00:07:16,550
in your front yard like that.
I wonder if the kitchen appliances

185
00:07:16,551 --> 00:07:19,790
convey how big is this house?
Is that.

186
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,770
Wait a minute.
That overhead view was the entire

187
00:07:21,771 --> 00:07:23,960
property baller.

188
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,410
You know what though?
But look at that picture though.

189
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,250
Does that look like $175?
Million dollars in your mind when you

190
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,560
think the whole fucking thing.
She'd be plated in gold.

191
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,380
Forty two acres.
Wow.

192
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,081
Okay.
There you go.

193
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,190
That's what,
that's what it is.

194
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,720
Oh,
the Ford family.

195
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,170
Oh Ah.
Oh.

196
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:45,560
Well the car company.
So hashtag balling on Mustang if you

197
00:07:45,561 --> 00:07:46,430
get,
I think you're right,

198
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:50,900
if you get to that point where you can
entertain the idea of maybe I'll put 10

199
00:07:50,901 --> 00:07:52,880
percent down and then I'll take the rest
of the mortgage.

200
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,470
Um,
then yeah,

201
00:07:54,471 --> 00:07:57,860
you've probably got too much money.
He reminds me of that scene in the big

202
00:07:57,861 --> 00:08:01,730
Lebowski when you meet the big Lebowski
and he's in the wheelchair and his

203
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,130
wife's off from the suck dude's Dick for
a thousand bucks.

204
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,300
You know,
it's like,

205
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,940
that's the kind of shit that happens.
You get a trophy wife,

206
00:08:07,941 --> 00:08:11,000
you buy yourself a mansion and your days
are just filled with stress is such a

207
00:08:11,001 --> 00:08:12,460
great movie.
It's a great movie.

208
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,240
God,
I used to use that movie to judge

209
00:08:14,241 --> 00:08:15,980
whether or not I enjoyed people's
opinions.

210
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,550
Really.
Tell me anything about the big Lebowski.

211
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,550
Okay.
I talked to a lot of people.

212
00:08:22,551 --> 00:08:24,950
They said I couldn't make it through the
first hour and I'm thinking,

213
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,860
how do you not?
How do you not find this funny?

214
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,500
Gees,
I let my kids watch it.

215
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,200
The admittedly the two youngest walked
away,

216
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:34,130
but the older one,
he,

217
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,570
you know.
So anyway,

218
00:08:35,571 --> 00:08:36,231
uh,
yeah,

219
00:08:36,231 --> 00:08:38,540
I've taken him fishing tomorrow morning
off to Alaska in the morning.

220
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,040
Oh,
salmon or halibut?

221
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,030
Salmon.
The Salmon.

222
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,440
I aren't uh,
you know,

223
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:44,780
interested in us.
We'll go after some.

224
00:08:44,781 --> 00:08:47,780
Halibut is a silver salmon season right
now.

225
00:08:47,781 --> 00:08:49,040
Right.
Okay.

226
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,410
So you're on the open water.
So when you guys go,

227
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,240
well,
we'll go.

228
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,090
Yeah,
we'll go up to catch can a,

229
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,630
which is really interesting place by
itself.

230
00:08:57,631 --> 00:09:00,780
And then we've got to take a plane out
of there about,

231
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:03,450
uh,
about 45 minutes outside of that to a

232
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,900
little place called [inaudible] Bay and
they have a really good operation up

233
00:09:06,901 --> 00:09:09,420
there and he spent a lot of time and to
be honest with you,

234
00:09:09,421 --> 00:09:11,520
if the,
if the fish aren't biting,

235
00:09:11,521 --> 00:09:12,800
then we just go hiking.

236
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:15,750
I'm going to take my boy will be a first
time for him to go up there and it's

237
00:09:15,751 --> 00:09:16,860
going to be great.
It's got.

238
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:21,870
But I've just now emptied the freezer of
a salmon and halibut and rock fish from

239
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:24,300
the last trip.
So it's time to stock up again,

240
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:26,940
but it's just a great time of year.
Isn't that a great thing?

241
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,670
To have fish that you caught in your
freezer,

242
00:09:29,671 --> 00:09:31,480
they can go back to the,
you know,

243
00:09:31,481 --> 00:09:34,710
it was only like an hour old by the time
you threw it on the ice.

244
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,300
It's,
it's fantastic.

245
00:09:36,301 --> 00:09:38,710
And so if and,
and just also just getting up there,

246
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:41,400
if people have been up to Alaska to get
up there and see it before it melts.

247
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:45,620
I said that I think it's good.
It'll be fine.

248
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,150
Are you worried about it?
Um,

249
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:50,130
you know what?
Not in the sense that Oh my God,

250
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,380
if I,
if I don't quit driving my wagon here,

251
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,630
the glaciers are going to all melt away.

252
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,320
I,
I,

253
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,630
you know,
I'm sure we have some impact and it's

254
00:09:57,631 --> 00:09:58,590
like everything else,
right?

255
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,070
The truth is in the middle somewhere,
right?

256
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:04,980
So I'm sure we should all do our part,
but do I think we're all gonna you know,

257
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:08,250
the polar bears are dying off tomorrow.
I know,

258
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,550
but well there's definitely somebody
with their ideas.

259
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,200
Yeah.
There's definitely some issues with

260
00:10:13,201 --> 00:10:17,130
polar bears in areas that have less ice,
but apparently the polar bear

261
00:10:17,131 --> 00:10:19,470
population.
This is something that I've read about

262
00:10:19,471 --> 00:10:21,240
Canada,
at least in Canada,

263
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,180
the polar bear population is higher than
it's been in years.

264
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,360
Now there's a,
there's not a shortage of polar bears,

265
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:31,440
but if you go over there to like they
have hunts for polar bears,

266
00:10:31,441 --> 00:10:34,630
like they pay people to take them on
polar bear hunts,

267
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,190
but then you can't bring the polar bear
back to the United States so you can

268
00:10:38,191 --> 00:10:39,420
keep it in Canada.

269
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:42,790
You can like if you come from Europe and
you want to hunt a polar bear,

270
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,010
you can.
It's all very.

271
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:46,140
Well.
You mentioned trying to pack a polar

272
00:10:46,141 --> 00:10:49,380
bear back into the states to know.
I just shot that.

273
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,630
You can see what the reaction would be
a.

274
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,830
I think it's yeah,
everybody should do their part,

275
00:10:55,831 --> 00:10:57,060
right?
There's no doubt about that.

276
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,690
You know,
don't be a Douche and.

277
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,920
But the problem is in part it's like
both sides,

278
00:11:01,921 --> 00:11:03,990
they latch onto one piece of
information.

279
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,430
Right?
So like what you just said,

280
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:07,150
you know,
the polar bear population to grow so

281
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,540
that once I will latch onto and say,
see,

282
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:12,480
there's no such thing as climate change
and the other side we'll find one piece

283
00:11:12,481 --> 00:11:13,920
of it and they'll latch onto that and
then,

284
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,600
okay.
And like I said,

285
00:11:15,601 --> 00:11:17,310
I,
I'm a big believer that somewhere in the

286
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:21,540
middle is where most of the truth sets,
but I'm sure there's definitely polar

287
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:24,060
bear problems higher north,
right in the ice caps.

288
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,030
And I mean I've seen some,
some issues where they're talking about

289
00:11:27,031 --> 00:11:31,380
polar bear starving up there and the
lack of ice contributing to starvation

290
00:11:31,381 --> 00:11:33,120
deaths.
And yeah,

291
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,290
so I,
but it's,

292
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,124
it's,
uh,

293
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,210
regardless,
I'm looking forward to the last guy.

294
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,800
I think regardless of what the hell
happened to the polar bears,

295
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,060
I'm going to have a good trip.
Um,

296
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,700
but I think it's,
it's a beautiful state.

297
00:11:44,701 --> 00:11:46,170
People should get up there if they
haven't been up there.

298
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,270
It's amazing.
Yeah.

299
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:52,170
It's one of the rare places that you
could go to in America that is like real

300
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:55,180
wilderness and that is a really wild
place.

301
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,110
And,
and you can get.

302
00:11:56,111 --> 00:11:56,771
Yeah,
exactly.

303
00:11:56,771 --> 00:11:59,570
And it doesn't take,
it doesn't take much to get up there and

304
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,610
money I just made,
it doesn't,

305
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,300
it's not the effort that people,
I think sometimes imagine it to be

306
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,780
right.
And uh,

307
00:12:04,781 --> 00:12:05,360
yeah,
so it's,

308
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,330
it's a,
it's a great trip.

309
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,960
Kids really looking forward to it and
it's weird that it's the United States,

310
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,180
isn't it?
When you look at the map.

311
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,830
Yeah.
You think about how it was put together.

312
00:12:14,831 --> 00:12:16,350
That's a fascinating story.
I,

313
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,980
for what?
That's worth people.

314
00:12:17,981 --> 00:12:22,870
That's another good interesting read is
how we cobbled this country together and

315
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:26,500
sort of some of it was just incredible
genius on the part of some folks.

316
00:12:26,501 --> 00:12:28,210
Some of it was serendipity,
some of it was,

317
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,400
you know,
short sighted vision on the part of the

318
00:12:30,401 --> 00:12:33,120
Russians or the French or oh they fucked
up.

319
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,650
But with Alaska the Russians fucked up.
Yeah.

320
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,930
What did they give that to us for like
50 bucks?

321
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,240
It wasn't much money.
It wasn't much.

322
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,910
No,
I guess we got our money's worth out of

323
00:12:42,911 --> 00:12:44,520
that by now.
But uh,

324
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,401
anyway,
so yeah,

325
00:12:45,401 --> 00:12:46,320
we'll do that.
And,

326
00:12:46,321 --> 00:12:47,154
and,
uh,

327
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,090
and,
and I planned this trip.

328
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,970
Of course their school starts tomorrow.
They're there,

329
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,190
all three of them are in elementary
school,

330
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:58,240
so their school starts tomorrow and uh,
and I gave my kid that option.

331
00:12:58,241 --> 00:12:59,030
I said,
do you want to,

332
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,910
you know,
he starts in fifth grade.

333
00:13:00,911 --> 00:13:01,744
I said,
do you,

334
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:04,970
do you want to stay here so you don't
miss the first few days at school?

335
00:13:04,971 --> 00:13:08,410
And he looked at me like,
what are you crazy exactly an idiot.

336
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:09,250
I mean,
that's how.

337
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,840
But it's what his eyes said.
He didn't say that.

338
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,210
How old is he?
He's just turned 10.

339
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,220
He's got to learn more in the woods.
Absolutely.

340
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,930
Absolutely.
For a couple of days.

341
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,010
Yeah.
Have a good time.

342
00:13:18,011 --> 00:13:21,840
Have a wonderful experience.
Because of course the grizzlies are out

343
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,000
looking for the salmon.
I mean,

344
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:24,670
and it's a,
it's just fantastic.

345
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,490
That's the safest time to be around
them.

346
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,950
So when their salmon out,
yeah,

347
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,510
they're just fat and happy there and
they don't bother you.

348
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,440
And so,
uh,

349
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,350
you know,
if something happens to my 10 year old

350
00:13:35,351 --> 00:13:36,880
and my wife said it's going to be my
fault,

351
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,100
that's on my head and I can't blame her.
That would,

352
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:42,340
that would be true.
But do you pack when you're out there,

353
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,050
you packing the side arm?
Um,

354
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,180
no,
no we don't because we're,

355
00:13:46,181 --> 00:13:49,120
when we go up there and we're going up
with uh,

356
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,220
what,
uh,

357
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,540
uh,
about a dozen other guys and they pan,

358
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,380
they deal with the lodge does stay in
the small little sort of.

359
00:13:57,381 --> 00:13:57,750
It's not,
I,

360
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,600
you know,
I say launch.

361
00:13:58,601 --> 00:14:00,100
It's a wonderful place.
Family owned.

362
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,820
It's not a fancy place at all,
but it's a great little spot and they do

363
00:14:03,821 --> 00:14:05,650
a great job.
The guides are fantastic.

364
00:14:05,651 --> 00:14:06,680
So,
um,

365
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,960
we'll have a good time.
But yeah,

366
00:14:07,961 --> 00:14:09,580
we don't,
we don't take anything with us.

367
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,200
I mean it's just.
Yeah,

368
00:14:11,201 --> 00:14:12,070
no,
that makes sense.

369
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,630
As long as the people up there,
I mean,

370
00:14:13,631 --> 00:14:16,570
you probably won't need anything as long
as the bears have fish.

371
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,041
They really have.
No.

372
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:22,510
There's an area that we've shown this
video before of this enormous grizzly

373
00:14:22,511 --> 00:14:27,460
that gets right next to this guy who's
sitting there photographing these bears,

374
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:32,350
eating a fish out of the river,
and the bear literally couldn't give a

375
00:14:32,351 --> 00:14:34,630
fuck.
He just looks at him and just sort of

376
00:14:34,631 --> 00:14:38,410
wanders off and there's actually a
statistic that no one has ever died in

377
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:39,370
this area.
No,

378
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:42,760
no person has ever been attacked or
killed in this one area just because

379
00:14:42,761 --> 00:14:45,760
it's just overrun with.so preoccupied
this time of year.

380
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,860
But it's also,
you know,

381
00:14:47,861 --> 00:14:51,710
you talk about how things change around
the planet and the salmon runs are

382
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,740
really being impacted right now by a
variety of reasons.

383
00:14:54,741 --> 00:14:56,030
You know,
it's not just one thing,

384
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,860
but.
So anyway.

385
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:58,880
Uh,
but that'll be,

386
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,500
that'll be good.
And I know that everybody was really

387
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:02,360
keen to hear about my upcoming trip.
So,

388
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,730
you know,
I mean,

389
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,540
it is interesting to hear people's take
on the climate issue because there's

390
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:09,920
hard left and hard,
right?

391
00:15:09,921 --> 00:15:11,240
Hard,
right is a,

392
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,520
it's a cycle.
It's always happened this way and

393
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:14,750
you're,
you're impeding business.

394
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:18,170
Hard left is we're all going to die and
then Miami's going to drown.

395
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,240
I mean,
uh,

396
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,150
an Al Gore had dirty predicted in that
movie an inconvenient truth that we were

397
00:15:23,151 --> 00:15:27,290
going to be covered in water in 2014,
2014.

398
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:30,560
They were predicting that the ocean
levels are going to rise the point where

399
00:15:30,561 --> 00:15:32,780
we're going to have to start evacuating
some of the coastal cities.

400
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,430
And he missed that one just by a little
bit,

401
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,293
but yeah.

402
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,130
Yeah.
But baby came out with another movie.

403
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,490
12 people saw an inconvenient truth and
um,

404
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,560
nobody,
nobody.

405
00:15:42,561 --> 00:15:44,420
I just watched it,
I don't think.

406
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:48,130
But it's,
you see bill Nye when he was on Tucker

407
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:49,310
Carlson's show.
No,

408
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,710
it was very interesting.
It was very interesting.

409
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:55,730
Cause I'm bill Nye who is not really a
scientist.

410
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:56,571
What is he?
Is He,

411
00:15:56,571 --> 00:16:01,571
uh,
he's just an engineer's near the base to

412
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,360
have to be smart,
but you know,

413
00:16:03,361 --> 00:16:05,030
he calls himself Bill Nye the science
guy.

414
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:07,070
He's bothered by the way,
as an undergraduate degree,

415
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:12,100
sunny even a phd I want to be.
And they were uh,

416
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:17,210
they were talking about climate change.
And Tucker Carlson said,

417
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:22,010
I'm willing to absolutely believe that
people have an impact on climate change.

418
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,720
He goes,
but can you tell me how much?

419
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:27,830
And then Bill Nye kind of got flustered
and you know,

420
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:31,820
he,
he got like little confrontational

421
00:16:31,821 --> 00:16:32,550
defensive.

422
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:35,400
It's really kind of interesting because
Tucker kept pestering him like,

423
00:16:35,401 --> 00:16:39,230
we're talking about science.
So I would like you to tell me how much

424
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:41,870
of an impact have people had.
What are the numbers?

425
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:44,230
Is it a narrow range?
Because you give me a narrow range.

426
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,720
It's just what he does is he publicizes
science for his own personal benefit.

427
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:54,020
Is that terrible show on Netflix.
Bill Nye saves the world,

428
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,980
bitch,
you're not saving shit then.

429
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,560
Okay.
You can't call your shell.

430
00:16:57,561 --> 00:17:00,530
Bill Nye saves the world.
You're not saving the world with this

431
00:17:00,531 --> 00:17:03,170
crazy goddamn song about gender.
And he has,

432
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,670
oh my God.
Did you see that?

433
00:17:04,671 --> 00:17:06,650
That was,
that was stunning.

434
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:11,120
Who The fuck greenlit dad?
Like I love Netflix,

435
00:17:11,121 --> 00:17:12,700
but hey,
a little quality controls.

436
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,470
Not a bad thing.
Just have somebody on set to go hope.

437
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:20,480
What we'll say is this like this,
like a sensor,

438
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:21,710
like in the old,
but that movie,

439
00:17:21,711 --> 00:17:22,760
good morning,
Vietnam,

440
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:25,760
you know somebody that sits there and
reads through his material before he

441
00:17:25,761 --> 00:17:26,570
does it and I saw that.

442
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:30,290
Not that you know it clearly they don't
have anybody who has to approve as

443
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:33,080
content.
That shows you where his mindset that

444
00:17:33,081 --> 00:17:36,110
he's willing to say yes to that.
That's someone who wants to acquiesce

445
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,390
with no uncertain terms to the left.
Yeah.

446
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:42,680
Like he just wants to.
Every meanwhile he had a film out of a

447
00:17:42,681 --> 00:17:47,681
movie or a television show out years ago
where he was describing gender and it

448
00:17:47,931 --> 00:17:51,840
was basically saying there's genders and
it's about x and y chromosome,

449
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,780
which is what everybody's been told in
science and biology class.

450
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,840
Then he has this show just a few years
later where thou,

451
00:17:57,841 --> 00:18:02,160
the tide has turned politically where
this is such a weird subject about

452
00:18:02,161 --> 00:18:07,161
gender and sexual identity and gender
identity and so he's got these songs

453
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:08,670
about,
you know,

454
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,860
like what that lady singing that song
like,

455
00:18:10,861 --> 00:18:13,680
Hey,
this is fucking terrible.

456
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,320
Like what all you're doing.
It's just like the same thing as

457
00:18:16,321 --> 00:18:17,960
president trump staring at the sun.
Yeah.

458
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:22,380
All you're doing is setting yourself up
for rootless criticism.

459
00:18:22,381 --> 00:18:25,620
That's going to diminish any potential
legitimate point that you actually have.

460
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:28,740
But I will say this,
I don't think he really got pilloried

461
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:29,251
for it.
Right?

462
00:18:29,251 --> 00:18:31,320
I mean nobody really.
Um,

463
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,750
I mean there was some,
some mine.

464
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,400
Yeah.
I think some people make fun of them,

465
00:18:35,401 --> 00:18:36,630
but I think Bill Knight for the most
part,

466
00:18:36,631 --> 00:18:39,150
he knows it.
It's a very comfortable place for him to

467
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:40,380
do.
Or for a lot of people,

468
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,340
if they say,
look,

469
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,430
I just want to get the adulation of the
left,

470
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:48,690
the far left and then fine.
I mean that's what you want to do,

471
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,930
do it.
But you see people that kind of shift

472
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:55,290
their position and are happy to be there
because they know they're going to be

473
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,740
coddled.
And I.

474
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,580
So I,
I get why he does it because it's a base

475
00:18:59,581 --> 00:19:00,560
of,
of uh,

476
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:04,320
it's an audience that he knows is gonna
stick with them as long as he says the

477
00:19:04,321 --> 00:19:06,540
right things.
And apparently he doesn't really give a

478
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,760
shit about science.
So he's happy to say anything.

479
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,320
Well,
I think he does give a shit about

480
00:19:10,321 --> 00:19:11,154
science.

481
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:15,940
He gives a shit more about people liking
him and fitting in with this crowd of

482
00:19:15,941 --> 00:19:17,680
people.
There's a weird thing that's going on in

483
00:19:17,681 --> 00:19:21,610
science and there's nothing like science
is fantastic.

484
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:25,630
It's critical for our civilization.
I'm not a science criticizer,

485
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:29,620
but there's a weird thing about people
that are a part of science where their

486
00:19:29,621 --> 00:19:34,621
own egos and their own need for positive
affirmation sort of supersede any

487
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,710
critical thinking.
So there's certain subjects that cannot

488
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:41,160
be discussed.
There's certain things that like,

489
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:42,160
they're,
they're almost like,

490
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,440
it's almost like science,
religion,

491
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,670
you know.
So there's certain subjects that are,

492
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,750
aren't even open to scrutiny.

493
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,450
Well I think that's right.
And I think part of it is,

494
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,820
is also we have gotten to a point where
you can't,

495
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:00,480
and I don't know how you walk it back,
but you can't have conflicting ideas in

496
00:20:00,551 --> 00:20:03,960
the same statement or the same sentence
and an idea.

497
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,710
Things conflict all the time.
Right.

498
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:10,730
And you can have a truths that collide
with each other and don't.

499
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:12,550
I don't necessarily make sense.
So.

500
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:16,810
But it seems as if now everything has to
be an absolute and whether it's climate

501
00:20:16,811 --> 00:20:18,040
change,
so you can't say,

502
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,330
you know,
if you,

503
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:22,660
if you just have this middle of the
road,

504
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,010
you know,
discussion where you're saying,

505
00:20:24,011 --> 00:20:24,844
well look,
of course,

506
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,040
you know,
humans I'm sure have some impact.

507
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,690
I don't know what that is.
And then,

508
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,560
and you know,
this is a problem,

509
00:20:30,561 --> 00:20:32,560
then we do have to do our part and we do
have to work to,

510
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,360
to try to be the best we can be.

511
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,450
But that's not good enough.
You've got to,

512
00:20:37,451 --> 00:20:41,500
you've got to be a sort of totalitarian
about the whole issue.

513
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:44,470
And it's not just that it's,
it's any argument,

514
00:20:44,471 --> 00:20:46,980
it just seems as if,
and it's not just a millennial,

515
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:49,420
so I'm not wanting to,
to beat on,

516
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,850
you know,
the young kids or the generation of

517
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:54,760
whatever we want to call them nowadays
because I know a lot of good kids that

518
00:20:54,761 --> 00:20:57,850
are out there that are working hard or
they're in the military and it's a

519
00:20:57,851 --> 00:21:01,150
fantastic group of folks.
So I think we're just fine in that

520
00:21:01,151 --> 00:21:02,890
regard.
But there does seem to be something

521
00:21:02,891 --> 00:21:06,880
about each successive generation and
we've gotten to a point where people

522
00:21:06,881 --> 00:21:11,650
have a hard time processing this
dissenting opinion idea and that starts

523
00:21:11,651 --> 00:21:15,700
to shut down debate and it starts to
shut down the idea that you can have a

524
00:21:15,701 --> 00:21:17,590
discussion about science,
where you have,

525
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,140
you know,
these conflicting ideas and how do you,

526
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,870
how do you resolve them?
That used to be the whole concept about

527
00:21:22,871 --> 00:21:27,160
sciences to test theories and with
little works and anyway,

528
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,880
what do I think?
It's because we're attaching egos and

529
00:21:29,881 --> 00:21:34,170
personalities and virtue signaling to
the actual hard data itself,

530
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,030
but here's,
here's the thing that we should all be

531
00:21:36,031 --> 00:21:37,680
concerned with.
Pollution.

532
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:39,570
We should all be concerned with human
waste.

533
00:21:39,571 --> 00:21:43,650
We should all be concerned with the
damage that we're doing to our water,

534
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:46,230
the damage that we're doing to the
environment,

535
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:49,350
the.
There's a host of different things that

536
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:53,100
human beings are involved in that are
creating irreparable harm to the

537
00:21:53,101 --> 00:21:54,750
environment.
We should absolutely be concerned with

538
00:21:54,751 --> 00:21:56,790
that,
but what's weird is that you hardly ever

539
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:59,670
hear about that.
You hardly ever hear about doing

540
00:21:59,671 --> 00:22:04,320
something to curb the plastic in the
ocean and doing something to eliminate

541
00:22:04,321 --> 00:22:06,060
that.
Some of the sewage waste that goes into

542
00:22:06,061 --> 00:22:07,580
the ocean doing the,
oh,

543
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:10,230
there's a ton of different things that
we're doing that are huge issues,

544
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:14,610
but instead you hear about climate
change and it becomes this ideological

545
00:22:14,611 --> 00:22:17,970
left versus right battle,
which is very weird to me.

546
00:22:17,971 --> 00:22:21,960
And I understand that climate change is
a real issue and if the ocean water

547
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:25,290
continues to rise,
coastal cities really are fucked and if

548
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:28,620
the temperature does rise,
we really might have to migrate to more

549
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,420
better climates.
But there's a lot of other shit going on

550
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:36,030
that seems to get ignored during this
process.

551
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,240
Just,

552
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:36,820
I mean,
I,

553
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,280
you know,
I'm old enough to remember when a

554
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:41,500
plastics that was an issue,
right?

555
00:22:41,501 --> 00:22:43,900
Plastic bags or,
or um,

556
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:46,660
you know,
keeping the oceans clean or you know,

557
00:22:46,661 --> 00:22:47,600
don't be a little bug.
I mean,

558
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:48,820
was,
it was more of a,

559
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,330
it was things that you could accomplish,
right?

560
00:22:52,331 --> 00:22:54,160
It was things that you could do with the
community.

561
00:22:54,161 --> 00:22:57,160
Could do.
So you would have these community drive

562
00:22:57,161 --> 00:23:02,161
to pick up trash or to not use plastic
bags or to whatever it is,

563
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:06,850
and it was stuff that you could do and
you could see some results and it felt

564
00:23:06,851 --> 00:23:09,600
good about it.
And you know,

565
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,590
who knows,
maybe we've gone past that now.

566
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:12,680
And so now,
uh,

567
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:15,120
that's not good enough because,
you know,

568
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:18,250
now we've got to save the planet.
Will you save the planet these little

569
00:23:18,251 --> 00:23:19,420
steps at a time,
right?

570
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,160
If every,
every community says,

571
00:23:21,161 --> 00:23:21,740
well,
you know,

572
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,470
I'm sorry I can't do anything about the
polar bears,

573
00:23:23,471 --> 00:23:25,360
so fuck it.
I'm just going to worry about myself.

574
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:27,550
But if you,
if you bring it back down to those

575
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,230
little things like you would,
you know,

576
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:33,040
maybe implying that I think we're better
off.

577
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,520
Right?
And eventually you,

578
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,590
you do make a difference.
But if all you do is talk about climate

579
00:23:38,591 --> 00:23:41,140
change and save the planet,
people just get overwhelmed.

580
00:23:41,141 --> 00:23:42,890
It's like a lot of other things in life
and you're just thinking,

581
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,950
fuck it.
I'm just gonna focus on other shit.

582
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,990
It was just so strange to

583
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,350
climate change.
It's become this weird ideological

584
00:23:48,351 --> 00:23:51,470
debate between the left and the right,
and is it when it comes to plastic,

585
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:54,350
there's a solution that's been around
for years for plastic.

586
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:58,700
There's biodegradable hemp plastic.
It's existed for a long time.

587
00:23:58,701 --> 00:24:00,950
If they just legalized hemp farming
nationwide,

588
00:24:00,951 --> 00:24:03,860
federally let people grow hemp in mass
quantities.

589
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:06,530
You could turn that into plastic.
You would never have to worry about

590
00:24:06,531 --> 00:24:09,080
water bottles again.
You'd never have to worry about garbage

591
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:10,280
bags.
He would never have to worry about

592
00:24:10,281 --> 00:24:12,980
anything because it's all be plant based
plastic,

593
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:16,070
which is real biodegradable.
You put it in the ground,

594
00:24:16,071 --> 00:24:17,530
it becomes dirt.
So what's the.

595
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,890
What's the,
what's the holdup?

596
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,040
Well,
federally hemp has been legal since the

597
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:23,340
19 thirties.
Yeah,

598
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,710
that's what it is.
I mean,

599
00:24:24,711 --> 00:24:28,700
and all of that goes back to William
Randolph hearst conning people into

600
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:32,590
making it illegal so we didn't have to
switch over his paper mills from wood

601
00:24:32,591 --> 00:24:34,220
son of a bitch.
That son of a bitch.

602
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,030
Yeah,

603
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,800
hearst.
That's right.

604
00:24:36,801 --> 00:24:38,740
I forgot he's the guy to do that.
Yeah.

605
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:39,880
Wow.

606
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,641
Yeah.
Amazing.

607
00:24:40,641 --> 00:24:45,530
Him and Harry Anslinger and you know,
what they did is they organized an

608
00:24:45,531 --> 00:24:50,531
actual campaign against Hamp as a
commodity by demonizing this thing that

609
00:24:52,131 --> 00:24:53,780
they called marijuana,
which didn't even,

610
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:58,790
it wasn't even the name of cannabis at
the time that marijuana was a name for a

611
00:24:58,791 --> 00:25:02,630
wild Mexican tobacco.
They applied that name to cannabis to

612
00:25:02,631 --> 00:25:06,470
say that there's this new drug that's
making Mexicans and blacks rape white

613
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:07,810
women and they,
you know,

614
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:11,360
he was a piece of Shit that William
Randolph hearst and he printed all these

615
00:25:11,361 --> 00:25:14,690
articles and his papers and they made
reefer madness and all that stuff.

616
00:25:14,691 --> 00:25:16,400
All those movies that they made back in
the day.

617
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,770
Have you ever seen?
Oh,

618
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:18,723
it's wonderful.
It's great.

619
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,000
It makes me want to get high.
And then,

620
00:25:21,001 --> 00:25:22,720
uh,
and then of course they made citizen

621
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:26,430
Kane and that turned her into a
household name and uh,

622
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:29,380
you know,
relatively benign character,

623
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:30,243
you,
Orson Welles,

624
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:33,130
I wonder what he did to Orson Welles.
He must have fucked with them a little

625
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:33,650
bit,
don't you think?

626
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:34,483
Yeah.
Yeah,

627
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,950
yeah.
Interesting.

628
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,360
When we did that movie come out,
citizen Kane came out in a long time.

629
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:40,510
You know,
people are like,

630
00:25:40,511 --> 00:25:42,700
why are they talking?
I want to say it was the fifties.

631
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,370
Oh,
it was earlier than that I think was 19,

632
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:47,913
19,
41.

633
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:48,790
Forty one.
Oh,

634
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:52,660
Rko pictures.
Still to this day,

635
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,780
it's an airplane.
I couldn't believe I was.

636
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,300
I was on an airplane not too long ago
when I was looking to the movies

637
00:25:57,301 --> 00:25:58,850
together.
Am I going to watch anything or am I get

638
00:25:59,020 --> 00:25:59,853
up?

639
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:04,090
And Susan Cain was on.
I couldn't put,

640
00:26:04,091 --> 00:26:06,370
which was strange.
It was right there in the middle of all

641
00:26:06,371 --> 00:26:11,140
these typical marvel and DC comics
movies that you would expect on a plane.

642
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,710
That's odd.
So I started watching it and the,

643
00:26:14,711 --> 00:26:16,600
uh,
the dude next to me in the seat next to

644
00:26:16,601 --> 00:26:19,090
me kind of starts,
you can tell when someone's watching

645
00:26:19,091 --> 00:26:21,940
your screen over there finally
attachment of the show.

646
00:26:21,941 --> 00:26:23,230
And he says,
what are you watching?

647
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:27,220
And he was you.
He was probably a couple of years

648
00:26:27,221 --> 00:26:28,450
younger than me,
but not much.

649
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,220
And I said,
I watch citizen Kane.

650
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:32,000
Never heard of it.
Never,

651
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,070
never heard of it.
I wish,

652
00:26:33,071 --> 00:26:34,300
I guess no big deal.
Fine.

653
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:36,730
But you know,
Jerry Lewis died and people are probably

654
00:26:36,731 --> 00:26:37,510
saying,
who's that?

655
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,070
He's like,
probably one of those dudes at the gym.

656
00:26:39,071 --> 00:26:42,070
It talks too much.
He's one of those guys that comes up to

657
00:26:42,071 --> 00:26:43,450
you while you're benching.
I'm gonna.

658
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,310
Ask a question,

659
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:47,310
am I doing this right?
Or even where I still go,

660
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:52,140
you should drop your shoulder a little
bit with those fucking guys because what

661
00:26:52,141 --> 00:26:55,020
you'll do is you'll stress that and then
that'll be better for you and you'll.

662
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:56,290
Okay.
Thank you.

663
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:59,070
Love those guys.
They use big words.

664
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:02,250
Try to convince you they know what
they're talking about.

665
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:06,240
So speaking of a citizen Kane and Orson
Welles and conspiracies,

666
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:11,350
last night I rewatched the episode of
Geraldo Rivera is good night America

667
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:15,020
when they introduced the Zapruder
because you know,

668
00:27:15,021 --> 00:27:16,390
Dick Gregory just died.
Yeah,

669
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:17,263
yeah,
yeah.

670
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:20,060
They introduced this approved or film to
the American public,

671
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,930
uh,
13 years or 12 years,

672
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:25,320
12 years after Kennedy's assassination.
And uh,

673
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:28,440
then I went and read that paper,
the articles.

674
00:27:28,441 --> 00:27:30,240
That was the printed a couple of weeks
ago that,

675
00:27:30,241 --> 00:27:31,410
uh,
you even tweeted about it,

676
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:36,270
about the CIA questioning the official
story of the JFK assassination.

677
00:27:36,271 --> 00:27:36,800
Yeah.
Yeah.

678
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,760
That was interesting,
wasn't it?

679
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:40,290
Yeah.
So the CIA guy,

680
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:41,640
what do you think about that?
Well,

681
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:42,810
first of all,
that's approved of film.

682
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:46,160
That's the most watched piece of film in
history of film has a really,

683
00:27:46,161 --> 00:27:47,360
which is really interesting.
Um,

684
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:48,853
but,
uh,

685
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,840
yeah,
it was interesting that the,

686
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,690
you know,
as typical with a lot of these things

687
00:27:53,691 --> 00:27:56,510
that the headline doesn't necessarily
actually match once you get into the

688
00:27:56,511 --> 00:28:00,560
body of the story,
but the idea being that the agency

689
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:07,390
had some concerns over
the idea that perhaps a Cuba was behind

690
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:14,090
the assassination was the Russians to
some degree or some more likely in a

691
00:28:14,091 --> 00:28:16,450
combination of the two.
Um,

692
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:17,623
look,
I think,

693
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,460
you know,
I do,

694
00:28:19,461 --> 00:28:20,390
I think that,
uh,

695
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:21,283
that,
uh,

696
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:23,060
he could have taken that shot.
Yeah,

697
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,153
it was,
it was.

698
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:24,890
Yeah,
it was not.

699
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:28,040
I said I've been up in that book
depository from that point of view,

700
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:29,720
that vantage point.
We did a story on the,

701
00:28:29,721 --> 00:28:30,554
on the,
uh,

702
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:31,663
the whole,
uh,

703
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:34,040
issue that conspiracy theory and what
could have happened.

704
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,630
Then we tried to find some new witnesses
and,

705
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,250
you know,
could he have made that shot?

706
00:28:37,251 --> 00:28:37,930
Yeah.
That was,

707
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:39,230
that was,
it was a straightforward,

708
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,090
you know,
effort was someone who had some

709
00:28:41,091 --> 00:28:41,781
training.
He was,

710
00:28:41,781 --> 00:28:43,370
you know,
he wasn't the world's best shot,

711
00:28:43,371 --> 00:28:45,200
but he had sufficient training to make
that shot.

712
00:28:45,201 --> 00:28:46,820
No,
that's separate from

713
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:53,350
his motivations and any potential
support that he may have gotten a during

714
00:28:53,391 --> 00:28:55,100
the course of that.
And,

715
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,470
you know,
I think that he,

716
00:28:57,471 --> 00:28:58,580
in his mind,
he,

717
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:02,690
he genuinely felt that this was going to
get him into the revolution,

718
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,560
right.
That this was going to.

719
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,680
It had a very unhappy experience in
Russia when he was over there living,

720
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,590
came back,
um,

721
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:12,650
saw what was happening in Cuba,
desperately wanted to be part of that,

722
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:16,190
uh,
took an unexplained trip down to Mexico.

723
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:19,490
Uh,
which could well have been in an effort

724
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:24,220
to find somebody who could support his,
his desire to,

725
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:27,140
to take some sort of action whether he
had formed in his mind that's what he

726
00:29:27,141 --> 00:29:29,600
was going to do at the time or not.
So,

727
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:32,420
you know,
is there a still a possibility that,

728
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:33,950
um,
the Cubans,

729
00:29:33,951 --> 00:29:37,310
which they're the Intel service there
would have had to file on him.

730
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,690
I mean,
he was a very,

731
00:29:38,691 --> 00:29:40,580
very well known quantity,
obviously by that time,

732
00:29:40,581 --> 00:29:42,010
for the Russians.
The Russians

733
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:45,430
are solely responsible for training up
the Cuban Intel service.

734
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:50,640
So there's a massive file on him and
they knew who they were dealing with.

735
00:29:51,011 --> 00:29:53,890
They knew his weaknesses,
they knew his,

736
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,560
um,
they knew his motivations,

737
00:29:56,561 --> 00:30:00,070
they knew what to do in terms of trying
to get leverageable,

738
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:01,090
you know,
uh,

739
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:02,650
information on him.
So I think that

740
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:06,070
the jury's still out.
I'm not,

741
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:11,071
and I'm not a conspiracy guy,
but I think there's enough there that

742
00:30:11,171 --> 00:30:12,950
says,
you know,

743
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,530
yes,
it's Kinda like what we're talking about

744
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,670
climate change.
I believe this,

745
00:30:15,671 --> 00:30:19,510
but this also could be true.
I think he could have taken that shot

746
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,030
for sure.
Uh,

747
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:21,531
and,
and,

748
00:30:21,531 --> 00:30:26,380
and succeeded,
I think it's also possible that he may

749
00:30:26,381 --> 00:30:30,550
have had the encouragement of,
in particular the Cuban Intel service

750
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,390
through the Russians because at that
time in particular they didn't do

751
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,760
anything.
The Cubans didn't do anything without

752
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:38,530
the Russians support blessings and
direction.

753
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:43,210
So that is entirely possible.
Um,

754
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,330
do I think that there were a variety of
other things at play,

755
00:30:46,331 --> 00:30:47,164
you know,
was,

756
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,170
did they help him get the,
the,

757
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:50,741
the,
uh,

758
00:30:50,741 --> 00:30:51,650
the weapon?
Did they,

759
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:52,050
I mean,
you know,

760
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:54,100
was her actual logistical support in
there?

761
00:30:54,101 --> 00:30:56,080
I don't know.
I don't think so,

762
00:30:56,081 --> 00:30:57,220
but that'd be on maybe.
Yeah,

763
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:57,901
it's,
it's a,

764
00:30:57,901 --> 00:30:59,350
it's a fascinating thing.
And you know,

765
00:30:59,351 --> 00:31:01,810
again,
nobody wants to think that something

766
00:31:01,811 --> 00:31:06,700
that uh,
impactful could have been just one guy

767
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,040
who,
you know,

768
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:11,140
had a dream about being a hero of the
revolution.

769
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,360
And I think they just,
it's,

770
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,010
it's such an awful thing to think about.
You want something bigger,

771
00:31:15,011 --> 00:31:17,230
you want something more behind it.
And it's,

772
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,180
it's,
I will say the one thing that I think

773
00:31:19,181 --> 00:31:21,940
there was something else too was the
Mlk,

774
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,310
Martin Luther King assassination.
Well,

775
00:31:24,311 --> 00:31:25,360
let's get to that for sure,

776
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:29,220
but here's the thing about the,
the Lee Harvey Oswald assassination,

777
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:30,840
you know,
a lot of people think that there was

778
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:34,860
people in the grassy knoll and that they
shot at the president and there was more

779
00:31:34,861 --> 00:31:37,350
than one shooter.
That's possible too.

780
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,560
And here's the other problem with people
saying that Oswald could have never made

781
00:31:40,561 --> 00:31:43,440
that shot.
Of course he could have 100 percent he

782
00:31:43,441 --> 00:31:44,910
could have.
Is it likely?

783
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,820
Listen,
people throw three point shots that have

784
00:31:47,821 --> 00:31:50,800
no fucking business on a basketball
court and they hit nothing but net.

785
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,530
It happens all the time.
It doesn't mean it's not likely that a

786
00:31:55,531 --> 00:31:57,450
guy could get off three shots that
quick,

787
00:31:57,451 --> 00:31:58,284
but it is possible.

788
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:01,440
There was more time in there than they
originally thought.

789
00:32:01,441 --> 00:32:03,390
There been.
There's some misinformation out there

790
00:32:03,391 --> 00:32:06,470
about how condensed that timeframe was.
And now after they've,

791
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:09,180
you know,
research has seemed to have a fairly.

792
00:32:09,181 --> 00:32:11,430
Well at that timeframe extended a little
bit,

793
00:32:11,431 --> 00:32:13,980
but he had more importantly he had.
He worked up there.

794
00:32:13,981 --> 00:32:15,960
So he had the opportunity to see that
site.

795
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,310
Right?
So he was like,

796
00:32:17,311 --> 00:32:20,220
he was sitting in a blind weight and
then figuring out what am I going to be

797
00:32:20,221 --> 00:32:23,820
doing here,
and that's a tremendous advantage and

798
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,400
clear daylight targets moving right in
line with you.

799
00:32:26,401 --> 00:32:27,480
There's no wind.

800
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,060
Not only that,
it's not that far shot.

801
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:30,841
No,
it's not.

802
00:32:30,841 --> 00:32:33,960
It's not like everybody thinks it's like
a half mile away or something like that.

803
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:36,870
I mean how far was it?
It was 150 yards or something like that

804
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:37,380
to

805
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,850
go back and find that.
But I've.

806
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:39,980
But I've stood on that

807
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:44,180
spot where the limo was at the site and
I stood up there and that down and it's

808
00:32:44,181 --> 00:32:46,820
not that far.
And it's a total makeup was shot on a

809
00:32:46,821 --> 00:32:47,710
deer.
Yeah.

810
00:32:47,711 --> 00:32:48,950
I'll give you.
We're going to shoot a deer with a

811
00:32:48,951 --> 00:32:49,581
rifle.
You'd be like,

812
00:32:49,581 --> 00:32:51,620
Oh yeah,
that's definitely my effective range.

813
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,080
No,
there was no how far it would go.

814
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,270
Two hundred and 60.
Five feet.

815
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,930
Eighty one meters.
That ain't shit.

816
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:02,300
That's a bowshot yeah.
You could shoot an animal with a bow

817
00:33:02,301 --> 00:33:04,820
from 80 meters if you're really good and
there's no wind.

818
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:09,200
So that's a really close shot.
So the idea that he couldn't make that

819
00:33:09,201 --> 00:33:10,790
shot,
he's a bad shot.

820
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:14,450
That is so fucking stupid.
He absolutely could make that shot and

821
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:16,820
that will look that he could make that
shot from 81 meters.

822
00:33:16,821 --> 00:33:19,100
That's nothing.
We looked at the grassy knoll issue.

823
00:33:19,101 --> 00:33:19,950
We looked at the end of that.

824
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:20,900
What,
what the,

825
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,500
the train yard engineer,
um,

826
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,540
reported seeing,
um,

827
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:29,600
with a sort of a puff of smoke that he
thought he saw over by the fence line.

828
00:33:29,601 --> 00:33:31,100
And,
and we're looking at like,

829
00:33:31,101 --> 00:33:31,820
yeah,
you could,

830
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:32,900
you know,
from that position,

831
00:33:32,901 --> 00:33:35,480
they opened that place up and we were
able to go back up there and you could

832
00:33:35,481 --> 00:33:37,550
see it.
We ran a couple of tests and fired off a

833
00:33:37,551 --> 00:33:39,630
few shots and that's always fun if you
want to have,

834
00:33:39,631 --> 00:33:42,980
I've got a good time to take a rifle to
dealey plaza and fire off a few shots

835
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:44,840
without the tourist knowing what the
hell is happening.

836
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:48,200
And The Dallas police by the way,
were tremendous during the course of

837
00:33:48,201 --> 00:33:48,710
that.
But,

838
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:50,750
um,
when did you guys do this?

839
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:53,990
We did this a while back for a show
called American declassified,

840
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,700
which isn't running anymore,
um,

841
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:58,280
but it was on a,
on the travel channel.

842
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,610
Jesse Ventura did that.
He went up there and with a mandolin

843
00:34:01,611 --> 00:34:06,350
incur carcanos same rifle.
And I was looking for a possible shock.

844
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:09,430
No one could make the shock camp.

845
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,300
I love Jesse.
I think he's awesome.

846
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:18,970
But you to be conspiracy
significantly on that side to the point

847
00:34:20,841 --> 00:34:21,560
where,
you know,

848
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,140
that's he's leaning always toward the
conspiracy.

849
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,510
Yeah.
Would you want to do is you want to do

850
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:28,130
every investigation,
and I know this company that I've got,

851
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:31,070
we,
we do a lot of investigations and you've

852
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,440
got a bill just like with a homicide
case or anything else.

853
00:34:33,441 --> 00:34:35,750
You've got to build it on stable ground,
right?

854
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,620
So you have to start from,
you know,

855
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:42,770
the very basics because if you start
building ideas and investigative

856
00:34:42,771 --> 00:34:45,860
inquiries on something that's not sturdy
underneath it,

857
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:49,070
you know,
not based on evidence and fact then you

858
00:34:49,071 --> 00:34:51,200
got a problem.
The whole thing becomes suspect and

859
00:34:51,201 --> 00:34:52,880
usually comes toppling down.
So,

860
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:54,163
you know,
I,

861
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:57,140
you got to keep an open mind about all
these things and I think it's important.

862
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,520
Um,
right now people are like,

863
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,470
Oh,
well I'm sure that agency,

864
00:35:00,471 --> 00:35:03,740
the CIA was involved.
So I'm a terrible source of information.

865
00:35:03,741 --> 00:35:04,700
I've,
I've heard that before.

866
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:07,010
So you can't talk credibly about this
because you know,

867
00:35:07,011 --> 00:35:09,590
the CIA was involved in,
I think he is a thing of the CIA was

868
00:35:09,591 --> 00:35:10,470
involved.
It's not you,

869
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:13,460
you weren't there.
And I was 62 last time I checked.

870
00:35:13,461 --> 00:35:17,480
I was not there in 1962 and a.
and also I will tell you this much.

871
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:20,060
Or was it 63?
It was 60 slash six slash 63.

872
00:35:20,061 --> 00:35:22,040
If the age,
if the agency had been involved.

873
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:26,960
This is the honest to God's truth.
There's no way that secret is still

874
00:35:26,961 --> 00:35:29,450
kept.
People can't keep their Yap shut.

875
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,830
They can't.
And secrets have a way of coming out and

876
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:35,990
certainly a lot quicker now than they
used to.

877
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:38,050
So now.
But I did

878
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:41,130
the secrets then.
I mean we're talking about so long ago

879
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,920
how much talking to them more than 50
years ago.

880
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:47,160
Like get out.
It's like the DB cooper issue,

881
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:51,780
my biggest reason for believing db
cooper died and his chute is hanging off

882
00:35:51,781 --> 00:35:53,970
a tree and that's a vast wilderness up
there.

883
00:35:53,971 --> 00:35:55,110
Yeah.
Is,

884
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:58,680
is that people just,
they can't help themselves at some point

885
00:35:58,681 --> 00:36:01,860
people talk or somebody talks somebody
associated with or somebody nearby or

886
00:36:01,861 --> 00:36:04,830
somebody involved or somebody on their
deathbed or somebody says something they

887
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:05,980
shouldn't have.
Um,

888
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:07,680
it's,
you know,

889
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:11,070
the idea that they've maintained this
sort of secret over a period of time.

890
00:36:11,071 --> 00:36:13,710
I find hard to believe I'm not
discounting it.

891
00:36:13,711 --> 00:36:16,170
And again,
you've got to leave a little space open

892
00:36:16,171 --> 00:36:18,120
for something that could be just
amazing.

893
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:21,180
But
anyway,

894
00:36:21,181 --> 00:36:22,920
so that's,
that was that.

895
00:36:22,921 --> 00:36:23,401
But I,
yeah,

896
00:36:23,401 --> 00:36:25,390
I agree that shot was not,
uh,

897
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:28,860
was not a tough shot.
One meters ain't shit and that's nothing

898
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:31,140
in particular in those conditions.
And I will say those conditions were

899
00:36:31,141 --> 00:36:33,960
ideal.
Unfortunately for that event.

900
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:38,680
People are like,
there's a video of me shooting a fucking

901
00:36:38,681 --> 00:36:43,090
hard drive at a hundred yards,
a hard drive and you must have hit it

902
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,220
that hard drive edge.
Well,

903
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,480
we getting rid of some hard yards,
thought it'd be fun to take it to the

904
00:36:46,481 --> 00:36:49,150
rifle range,
so I'd take it to the rifle and

905
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:52,930
obviously we're dealing with modern
rifles are probably more accurate,

906
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:56,770
but I'm shooting something that's
basically two inches high,

907
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:00,250
laying it down on the ground at a
hundred yards and blown to smithereens.

908
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,680
That's how accurate a rifle is at a
hundred yards.

909
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,620
You tell me he couldn't get a headshot
at 81 meters.

910
00:37:05,621 --> 00:37:06,140
That's crazy.

911
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:06,761
Again,
no,

912
00:37:06,761 --> 00:37:09,520
she caught wind.
Of course he could go to light.

913
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,850
Did he go with he?
That's really the question is,

914
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,640
you know,
we have some pretty good indication as

915
00:37:15,641 --> 00:37:18,220
to what he was thinking and what is
obviously what his motivations were and

916
00:37:18,221 --> 00:37:19,054
that's important.

917
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:23,060
It definitely was in with the Russians
definitely was involved in a lot of

918
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:27,830
weird shit with communism.
Who knows what his entire full

919
00:37:27,831 --> 00:37:30,810
background was because there was a lot
of covert shit going on.

920
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:33,640
Did he?
Did he express a desire to do something

921
00:37:33,641 --> 00:37:36,730
like this to the Russians at some point
and they know that,

922
00:37:36,731 --> 00:37:38,380
okay,
well here's an interesting opportunity,

923
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:38,830
right?
Yeah.

924
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:40,900
They would have,
they would have sparked on that and they

925
00:37:40,901 --> 00:37:43,090
would have thought about it.
They would,

926
00:37:43,091 --> 00:37:45,430
they have actually,
you know,

927
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,920
play on words intended,
but would they have pulled the trigger

928
00:37:47,921 --> 00:37:52,840
on an operation trying to push him into
doing an act like this indirectly

929
00:37:52,841 --> 00:37:54,040
through the Cubans.
Exactly.

930
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:57,240
Especially if like this crazy fuck Mike,
go ahead and do this for us.

931
00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:00,660
So after the Bay of Pigs,
people have to realize there was a lot

932
00:38:00,661 --> 00:38:02,220
of people pissed off at Kennedy,
we lost

933
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:04,090
bullshit.
Hated Buddy.

934
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:05,340
Christian hated Kennedy.
Yeah.

935
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,600
And so,

936
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:09,540
well that infamous video where he's
banging his shoe down on the table.

937
00:38:09,541 --> 00:38:10,470
We will bury you.

938
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,211
Yeah.
Yeah,

939
00:38:11,211 --> 00:38:11,601
no,
it was,

940
00:38:11,601 --> 00:38:14,600
it was the,
the environment was right for them and

941
00:38:14,601 --> 00:38:15,051
they.
And again,

942
00:38:15,051 --> 00:38:16,460
the Russians.
It shouldn't be a surprise to anybody

943
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:18,440
when you talk about what they did during
this election.

944
00:38:18,441 --> 00:38:20,450
I mean they've been doing this forever.
There you go.

945
00:38:20,451 --> 00:38:24,290
Back to the 19 forties and the Russians,
were you spending a lot of time and

946
00:38:24,291 --> 00:38:27,200
effort and money here in the states
trying to keep us out of the war?

947
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:31,080
Back before Hitler invaded Russia,
when they were allied with the Nazi

948
00:38:31,081 --> 00:38:33,330
still,
so they spent a lot of time.

949
00:38:33,331 --> 00:38:36,460
They set up independent association.
Supposedly

950
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,750
they paid off a lot of unions and union
members,

951
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,990
a journalists.
I mean they were doing everything they

952
00:38:40,991 --> 00:38:45,070
could create this or to strengthen the
idea of isolationism just to keep us

953
00:38:45,071 --> 00:38:47,170
out.
They've been doing this for as long as

954
00:38:47,171 --> 00:38:48,920
they've been around.
So anybody who says,

955
00:38:48,921 --> 00:38:49,261
well,
I can't.

956
00:38:49,261 --> 00:38:49,890
You know,
it's,

957
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:51,850
it's shocking.
The Russians will be engaged in this is.

958
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,140
It's ridiculous.
They've always been.

959
00:38:53,141 --> 00:38:55,270
Again,
we by the way have been engaged doing

960
00:38:55,271 --> 00:38:56,290
that with them.
What?

961
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,270
That's what I hear.
Fine.

962
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,510
I've heard that online.
I find that hard to leave.

963
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:04,570
The thing that bothers me the most about
the Kennedy assassination is the

964
00:39:04,571 --> 00:39:07,180
universal support for the magic bullet
theory.

965
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,850
I think that fucking bullet is
ridiculous.

966
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:12,340
I've shot things.
I've shot a lot of things.

967
00:39:12,341 --> 00:39:15,040
I know what happens to bullets.
Everybody that I know that's a marksman,

968
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:16,120
everybody knows it's a hunter.

969
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:21,010
They see a bullet that has hit bone.
It fucking never looks like that.

970
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:25,420
When a bullet goes through to people and
comes out looking like you shot it into

971
00:39:25,421 --> 00:39:27,580
a pool of water,
that's what it looks like.

972
00:39:27,581 --> 00:39:30,940
I don't buy that at all.
And the convenience of finding it on

973
00:39:30,941 --> 00:39:33,700
Connolly's Gurney and they enroll them
into the hospital.

974
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:35,350
Oh look guys,
we found the bullet.

975
00:39:35,351 --> 00:39:36,370
Got It.
And it's perfect.

976
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:38,530
God,
I don't buy that for a second.

977
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,760
And the problem is there's more metal
fragments in connally's body.

978
00:39:42,761 --> 00:39:44,410
Then we're missing from the bullet
itself.

979
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:47,110
I think that bullet itself,
look at that bullet.

980
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:51,340
Get the caddy.
That thing didn't hit shit.

981
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,620
Uh,
it's exactly right.

982
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,600
The conditioned with this with people
that have never shot guns.

983
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:59,350
And they go,
well actually proven that broke bones

984
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,420
and a bullet breaks bones.
They get fucked.

985
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:02,500
Melissa jacketed bullets.

986
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:06,400
When it's jacketed bullets breaks bones.
It gets fucked.

987
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:08,110
You're talking about something that's
going.

988
00:40:08,111 --> 00:40:10,420
I mean,
how fast is a bullet from that rifle go.

989
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:13,060
It's got to be that.
It would be interesting thing to pull

990
00:40:13,061 --> 00:40:14,770
up,
but I would imagine it's in the

991
00:40:14,771 --> 00:40:17,140
thousands of feet per second.
It's got to be.

992
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:20,090
When it hits bone,
it's going to it as well.

993
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,630
There's always distortion.
Even if you're.

994
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:25,210
I mean,
so I don't know when you have a

995
00:40:25,211 --> 00:40:29,650
conversation about this and it is
somebody who has no shooting experience

996
00:40:29,651 --> 00:40:31,300
or you know,
it just,

997
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:32,171
I think.
All right,

998
00:40:32,171 --> 00:40:34,210
that's fine.
I understand why you're fascinated by

999
00:40:34,211 --> 00:40:35,460
it,
but do,

1000
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,180
when you do your research,
you know,

1001
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,560
it's,
it's like with news,

1002
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:39,990
read everything,
right?

1003
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,620
Read The Wall Street Journal,
read The New York Times,

1004
00:40:41,621 --> 00:40:42,740
read the Financial Times,
read,

1005
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,100
read the economist.
I read everything.

1006
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,750
Yes.
Before you form your opinion.

1007
00:40:46,751 --> 00:40:47,111
Right?
And,

1008
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,990
and,
and everybody is so siloed nowadays and

1009
00:40:49,991 --> 00:40:51,460
you get the same thing with conspiracy
theories.

1010
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,470
I absolutely believe this and I'm not
going to,

1011
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,440
I'm going to discount everything else
that's out there and,

1012
00:40:56,441 --> 00:40:58,480
or just not pay any attention to it.
Um,

1013
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:01,300
yeah.
But it's hard to say.

1014
00:41:01,301 --> 00:41:03,640
And here's another thing,
the magic bullet path.

1015
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,361
People like,
well,

1016
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:06,120
how is that possible?
Well,

1017
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:09,190
let me tell you something that's the
most believable thing about the magic

1018
00:41:09,191 --> 00:41:11,530
bullet.
There is the path of the bullet because

1019
00:41:11,531 --> 00:41:14,980
bullets do wacky shit when they hit bone
and you can't predict it at all.

1020
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:16,870
I know a guy who,
uh,

1021
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,160
in Iraq,
they shot a guy in the head from the

1022
00:41:21,161 --> 00:41:25,120
front and it went out as eyeball.
The bullet came out of his eyeball back

1023
00:41:25,121 --> 00:41:28,870
forward.
It ricocheted inside of his skull and

1024
00:41:28,871 --> 00:41:30,720
came out as I know you can't.
I mean,

1025
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:31,690
again,
you can't put you right,

1026
00:41:31,691 --> 00:41:33,710
you can't predict it.
They'll try to model these things and

1027
00:41:33,711 --> 00:41:35,390
figure out a way,
but you know,

1028
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,500
there's an unknown there.

1029
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,670
And so yeah,
I agree.

1030
00:41:37,671 --> 00:41:39,560
I mean,
I think that again,

1031
00:41:39,561 --> 00:41:41,650
it's,
it's one of those things where it,

1032
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:44,480
it,
it's never going to get resolved and it,

1033
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:47,390
it's going to continue to live on
because a,

1034
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,930
it was such an important event in the
history of the country.

1035
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:52,280
And B,
it's,

1036
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:56,000
I keep going back to that same thing.
People don't want to believe that really

1037
00:41:56,001 --> 00:41:58,820
awful shit can happen sometimes in a
very simple,

1038
00:41:58,821 --> 00:42:02,720
straightforward way.
And so it's much easier to think it was

1039
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:05,930
a broad base conspiracy.
There were lots of moving parts,

1040
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:10,040
sometimes bad shit happens and it's just
as simple as it seems that is possible.

1041
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:11,990
Conversely,
people don't like to believe in

1042
00:42:11,991 --> 00:42:13,880
conspiracies,
especially when it's involved in an

1043
00:42:13,881 --> 00:42:15,500
assassination of president.
Right.

1044
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:18,980
You know the reason why they came up
with the whole magic bullet theory in

1045
00:42:18,981 --> 00:42:20,810
the first place is pretty shady in the
first,

1046
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:23,090
in fact,
the reason why they did it because the

1047
00:42:23,091 --> 00:42:28,091
guy got hit by a ricochet underneath the
overpass and they blamed that bullet on

1048
00:42:28,341 --> 00:42:31,160
one of the,
one of the shots from Lee Harvey Oswald

1049
00:42:31,161 --> 00:42:32,150
and the book depository.

1050
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:32,871
So they said,
well,

1051
00:42:32,871 --> 00:42:36,150
all right,
so now we have less bullets that could

1052
00:42:36,151 --> 00:42:38,600
have hit Kennedy.
We have all these wounds and we have to

1053
00:42:38,601 --> 00:42:41,120
attribute a series of wounds to one
bullet.

1054
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:41,931
Right?
Right.

1055
00:42:41,931 --> 00:42:44,090
So that was the thought process behind
it.

1056
00:42:44,091 --> 00:42:46,760
But this is approved.
Or film was the one that got people

1057
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:49,310
weirded out by it.
But I'll tell you about men.

1058
00:42:49,311 --> 00:42:53,420
I've watched that film a bunch of times
and one of the things that don't jive is

1059
00:42:53,421 --> 00:42:55,020
if he did get hit from the front,
you know,

1060
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:58,580
head goes back to the left.
Why is the blood spray out forward?

1061
00:42:59,240 --> 00:42:59,950
See,
it's,

1062
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:02,420
it's,
it's weird the way the impact of the

1063
00:43:02,421 --> 00:43:05,840
blood is,
the blood sprays forward and then his

1064
00:43:05,841 --> 00:43:08,720
head goes back into the left.
It could have possibly been that he was

1065
00:43:08,721 --> 00:43:11,030
hit from the front end,
the back at the same time.

1066
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:12,920
That's entirely possible.
I mean,

1067
00:43:12,921 --> 00:43:15,200
that is a tactic you would do,
right?

1068
00:43:15,201 --> 00:43:18,560
You would roll someone into an area
where they would be in a crossfire and

1069
00:43:18,561 --> 00:43:21,290
they'd get shot if they came in.
If there was,

1070
00:43:21,291 --> 00:43:22,050
if the grass,
you know,

1071
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:24,890
it was in fact a second site for a
shooter.

1072
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:30,310
Then by the time it hits that corner and
starts its path just before the shots

1073
00:43:32,061 --> 00:43:34,550
were fired from the book depository and
Oswald,

1074
00:43:34,551 --> 00:43:35,780
if you,
if you're going with that,

1075
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,720
if you had an another shooter up on the
grass,

1076
00:43:38,721 --> 00:43:40,080
you know,
you're,

1077
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:44,840
you are basically looking right at the,
the,

1078
00:43:44,841 --> 00:43:45,351
uh,
the,

1079
00:43:45,351 --> 00:43:47,120
the,
the front of the vehicle.

1080
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:50,660
And because of the way that it's
positioned in the nols kind of turned

1081
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:55,661
and then it's just that,
it's just that there's not a lot of

1082
00:43:57,350 --> 00:44:00,110
concealment up there.
And they had that.

1083
00:44:00,111 --> 00:44:01,970
They had the fence,
picket fence.

1084
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:03,380
It's not the original one that Sarah
anymore,

1085
00:44:03,381 --> 00:44:06,050
but it's basically in line with it.
And you can see there's plenty of

1086
00:44:06,051 --> 00:44:07,200
pictures of the.
Oh,

1087
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:09,860
the previous fence,
it was up there at the time.

1088
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,700
Um,
and you had that,

1089
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:17,600
you did have the train yard engineer
report sometime after the fact that he

1090
00:44:17,601 --> 00:44:20,810
saw a puff of smoke and he wasn't quite
sure what that was all about and he'd

1091
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:24,710
seen a couple of people back there so
that,

1092
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:25,670
you know,
that was,

1093
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:27,920
that's an interesting thread to pull on.
Right.

1094
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:28,870
And,
and I think that,

1095
00:44:28,871 --> 00:44:32,970
that it's been,
it's been ad nauseum doesn't mean that

1096
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:36,510
you couldn't still find something.
It also doesn't mean anybody's going to

1097
00:44:36,511 --> 00:44:39,170
really find a conclusion after the fact.
Right.

1098
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:40,530
Firstly,
today.

1099
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:41,041
Yeah.
No.

1100
00:44:41,041 --> 00:44:41,970
And that's right.
And you know,

1101
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:44,340
maybe it's like everything else,
as time marches on,

1102
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:46,290
you lose,
you lose witnesses,

1103
00:44:46,291 --> 00:44:47,430
you lose,
you know,

1104
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:50,910
people that were there on site and even
witnesses when someone gets shot.

1105
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,820
No,
especially with the precedent is not

1106
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:54,950
credible.
Five different stories from five

1107
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,420
different people and gunshots heard from
the moon.

1108
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:59,520
Nobody will get that just from a
robbery,

1109
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:02,340
just straight driving in a car accident
you'd say you'd say,

1110
00:45:02,341 --> 00:45:03,900
what did you see?
If you have separate people out,

1111
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:05,430
you're right,
you'll get five different versions from

1112
00:45:05,431 --> 00:45:07,980
five different people and you know,
so yeah,

1113
00:45:07,981 --> 00:45:12,470
I wasn't a witness accounts.
I tend not to be a particularly a

1114
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,600
credible and you've got to,
you know,

1115
00:45:14,601 --> 00:45:15,010
you,
you,

1116
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:19,040
you got to take them and then you gotta
match it up with other information that

1117
00:45:19,041 --> 00:45:20,520
you can,
you can pull together forensically.

1118
00:45:20,521 --> 00:45:22,770
But it's a,
it is fascinating.

1119
00:45:22,771 --> 00:45:26,130
I know who knows where it's going to DB
Cooper's back in the news a little bit

1120
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,120
because it really.
Yeah.

1121
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:28,013
Yeah.
They've uh,

1122
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:29,790
initially it was because the bureau was
saying,

1123
00:45:29,791 --> 00:45:30,330
okay,
we're,

1124
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:31,560
we're closing this case.

1125
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:34,350
And then there's some talk now over the
past day and a half,

1126
00:45:34,351 --> 00:45:37,710
two days that they might've found
something up in the wilderness that

1127
00:45:37,711 --> 00:45:40,230
might be a piece of the shoot that he
had.

1128
00:45:40,231 --> 00:45:42,930
And I know they haven't,
they haven't bought them that one out

1129
00:45:42,931 --> 00:45:44,280
yet.
But Cooper,

1130
00:45:44,281 --> 00:45:47,010
more new evidence of parachute believed,
found.

1131
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:49,180
But how they know that's his parachute.
Yeah.

1132
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:50,630
The thing about,
I mean,

1133
00:45:50,631 --> 00:45:52,680
it could be,
but the thing about something that's

1134
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,820
that long ago,
we have to realize how many people die

1135
00:45:56,821 --> 00:45:58,060
in the woods every year.
Yeah.

1136
00:45:58,180 --> 00:45:59,130
Yeah.
And when you go,

1137
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:00,650
when you come out the back of that
plane,

1138
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:02,970
I'm good luck.
Yeah.

1139
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:05,370
And,
and also he was in a suit.

1140
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,550
He was wearing loafers.
He lost his shoes.

1141
00:46:07,551 --> 00:46:09,840
So he hits those,
that wilderness.

1142
00:46:09,841 --> 00:46:14,820
He hits those trees and uh,
it was cold that night and it was wet.

1143
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:18,240
And there's going to be a man hunt on,
in the morning.

1144
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:18,841
No,
he had his,

1145
00:46:18,841 --> 00:46:20,570
he had his,
he had his,

1146
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:24,240
um,
a parachute and he had the bag with the

1147
00:46:24,241 --> 00:46:25,930
money.
They'd given him money.

1148
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:26,820
So.
And that,

1149
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:30,540
that was it.
And so I'm no wilderness gear at all.

1150
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:32,340
No.
Well not that they know of.

1151
00:46:32,341 --> 00:46:33,001
I mean,
who knows,

1152
00:46:33,001 --> 00:46:35,460
maybe underneath his business suit he
was wearing something,

1153
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:39,030
but I'm just going to be wearing.
So what was the time of the year?

1154
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,980
Uh,
it was late in the year I think.

1155
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:42,450
I think I have to go back and check
again,

1156
00:46:42,451 --> 00:46:45,450
but I think it was November,
I want to say part of the country up in

1157
00:46:45,451 --> 00:46:46,060
the,
uh,

1158
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:48,510
the wilderness up in Washington state.
Oh,

1159
00:46:48,511 --> 00:46:51,270
he's dead before thanksgiving.
Before thanksgiving.

1160
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,113
Yeah.
That guy's dead.

1161
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,140
Yeah.
I mean it's just not going to make you

1162
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:58,320
make your way out of there.
And it's nighttime and you know that.

1163
00:46:58,321 --> 00:46:59,160
And,
and you know,

1164
00:46:59,161 --> 00:47:00,890
they again,
there's going to be a manhunt starting.

1165
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:02,550
No,
let's.

1166
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:05,370
Trout wouldn't survive up there,
but there's been all sorts of theories.

1167
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,830
Oh,
he jumped out and then some people met

1168
00:47:07,831 --> 00:47:08,664
them.
Well,

1169
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,890
maybe good luck finding them.
Right.

1170
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:13,710
How are you going to be able to be so
silly?

1171
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:16,710
People jumping out of an airplane with
no gps.

1172
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:19,140
Do the odds of finding that guy and he's
not,

1173
00:47:19,141 --> 00:47:20,470
he doesn't have a flare.
Like what does,

1174
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,680
what does he have?
How are you going to look at?

1175
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:24,150
I'm going to just find him in the woods.
That's why I think there's,

1176
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:25,350
you know,
there was some talk,

1177
00:47:25,351 --> 00:47:25,800
well,
you know,

1178
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,920
because some of his money was found,
um,

1179
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:30,430
you know,
after the fact stacked in a,

1180
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:31,530
in a little,
uh,

1181
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:35,920
a part of the river that seemed unusual,
right?

1182
00:47:35,921 --> 00:47:39,340
It seemed like it would have had to make
a pretty amazing journey from the

1183
00:47:39,341 --> 00:47:44,080
wilderness down through the stream
system out to the river and then be

1184
00:47:44,081 --> 00:47:47,950
found on this sandbar and it was all
stacked one on top of the other,

1185
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,980
but it had the light,
it had the serial numbers.

1186
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:54,240
And so there was some thought that,
you know,

1187
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:57,250
how did that get there?
Did it naturally just float down there

1188
00:47:57,251 --> 00:47:59,730
and ended up on the sandbar and covered
in Santa.

1189
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:01,720
Eventually was found by some kid that
was on a picnic.

1190
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:03,910
Whoa.
You know,

1191
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:08,620
I'm wondering if that's slowly,
how long would it take for you get

1192
00:48:08,621 --> 00:48:11,350
busted.
And that was $200,000 back in the day,

1193
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:14,290
a little bit here and there.
Now buy a bicycle.

1194
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:20,140
Seems good by TV.
No one saying nothing but bicycle.

1195
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:23,960
These little kid,
you know my way to California where the

1196
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:26,550
weather's coming,
room's got a 50 inch tv with the fuck's

1197
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:29,650
going on.
You don't even have a job be what the

1198
00:48:29,651 --> 00:48:32,260
hell are you doing?
Where did you get that transistor radio?

1199
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,610
Well,
if it's a kid who found it,

1200
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,130
I'm sure I see what you're saying.
Yeah,

1201
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:36,310
yeah,
no,

1202
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:39,030
he reported the kid was with his family
and he reported finding Amelie.

1203
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:44,130
That bureau went out there and dug up
the entire area and in a fairly large

1204
00:48:44,201 --> 00:48:46,270
effort trying to figure out what is
there more money there?

1205
00:48:46,271 --> 00:48:48,200
How did it get there?
Run tests.

1206
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,140
I think if they found his money,
he's dead.

1207
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:53,170
It's not going to jump out of a
parachute and then leave the money.

1208
00:48:53,171 --> 00:48:55,390
There was some thought that maybe he was
doing it as a ploy,

1209
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:56,350
right?
To,

1210
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:58,840
to kind of distract and think,
okay,

1211
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:01,740
he's dead because the money's there.
Uh,

1212
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:04,540
but again,
it falls into the category of,

1213
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:05,920
you know,
it's never going to be resolved,

1214
00:49:05,921 --> 00:49:07,780
I don't think.
And it's a fascinating story.

1215
00:49:07,781 --> 00:49:10,720
It's Americans only on solved hijacking.
Am I right about that?

1216
00:49:10,721 --> 00:49:13,660
I think Americans only unsolved does it
all the money.

1217
00:49:13,661 --> 00:49:16,390
Did they find all of it or what?
It was just a small amount.

1218
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:17,860
It was not,
it was not a large amount.

1219
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:19,480
So he did not.
If he,

1220
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:23,140
if he planted the theory was smart
enough not to put it all their weird

1221
00:49:23,141 --> 00:49:25,600
story.
That db cooper one's a weird one because

1222
00:49:25,601 --> 00:49:28,330
a lot of people,
they tend to look at him like some sort

1223
00:49:28,331 --> 00:49:32,660
of a folk hero.
There was a connection with him that

1224
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:35,960
they were,
they were thinking he was this guy who

1225
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:39,430
up,
I want to say shot family members and

1226
00:49:39,431 --> 00:49:42,160
murdered family members and then went
out and did that crime.

1227
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:47,460
There was some suspect that was on the
loose from some sort of a homicide that

1228
00:49:47,771 --> 00:49:51,130
they connected to the DB cooper case and
they thought that somehow there was a

1229
00:49:51,131 --> 00:49:53,800
potential that they were related,
that it was the same guy.

1230
00:49:53,801 --> 00:49:55,330
Yeah,
he loses some of his charm.

1231
00:49:55,331 --> 00:49:56,700
If that's the case.
Yeah,

1232
00:49:56,710 --> 00:49:58,210
it'd be just a guy that's,
you know,

1233
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,160
thinking I'm going to hijack a plan for
some cash.

1234
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,340
And where'd he get the money?
Where did the cash come from?

1235
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:06,710
They brought it on the plane and they
landed and then they gave him the money

1236
00:50:06,711 --> 00:50:09,910
that they got the passengers and the
most of the crew off of there.

1237
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:13,210
And then everybody was in the cockpit
with the door closed when the,

1238
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:17,860
in the old days in the back door would
open up the steps and he went out the

1239
00:50:17,861 --> 00:50:19,420
back door.
They had a backdoor indicator,

1240
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:22,420
which is how they kind of sensed about
where he would have gone out.

1241
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:24,610
And uh,
anyway,

1242
00:50:24,611 --> 00:50:27,080
I sound like a db cooper.
So how high was he up there when he

1243
00:50:27,081 --> 00:50:29,620
jumped
again?

1244
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:33,500
I have to go through my notes,
but I think commercial flight.

1245
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:34,821
No.
Oh No,

1246
00:50:34,821 --> 00:50:35,361
no,
no,

1247
00:50:35,361 --> 00:50:35,721
no,
no,

1248
00:50:35,721 --> 00:50:37,250
they,
they dropped down to,

1249
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:41,300
I want to say about 10,000 feet.
I can't remember,

1250
00:50:42,350 --> 00:50:44,390
but they're not really sure because the
door came down.

1251
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:47,930
He could've been there for any period of
time and he had instructed them to drop

1252
00:50:47,931 --> 00:50:49,870
down.
I forget again what altitude he was

1253
00:50:49,871 --> 00:50:50,750
head,
but you know,

1254
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:53,690
it's just,
it's amazing that these things continue

1255
00:50:53,691 --> 00:50:58,190
to go on and we love mysteries.
I love mysteries and conspiracies and

1256
00:50:58,191 --> 00:51:00,620
uh,
which is why the new trump

1257
00:51:00,621 --> 00:51:02,540
administration is so interesting.
Well,

1258
00:51:02,541 --> 00:51:04,490
he loves conspiracies,
doesn't he?

1259
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:08,390
He believes a bunch of crazy ones.
Like he was just a retweet that one

1260
00:51:08,391 --> 00:51:09,224
about,
um,

1261
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,050
what was the general that uh,
they,

1262
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,790
they attraction to pershing dip in the
pigs.

1263
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,280
Uh,
the bullets in pig's blood.

1264
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,790
Yeah.
And there was never an attack,

1265
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:18,860
uh,
Islamic attack at 35 years.

1266
00:51:18,861 --> 00:51:20,540
That's not even a true story.
Know who?

1267
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:21,553
But again,
who,

1268
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:23,960
why?
Why aren't you doing this?

1269
00:51:23,961 --> 00:51:26,280
Why it just stop?
Yeah,

1270
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:27,710
it does.
There's no,

1271
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,600
there's no like,
I didn't vote for him.

1272
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:30,710
I didn't vote for her.
I,

1273
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:33,740
I just thought we could have done better
in a country this size.

1274
00:51:33,741 --> 00:51:35,600
Right.
Tell you one thing he's doing.

1275
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:40,040
He's fucking it up for future idiots.
Idiots.

1276
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,230
Oh No,
no.

1277
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:45,680
I would not underestimate our ability to
hire somebody worse.

1278
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:50,720
I'm never going to be as someone like
maybe there'll be like a new version of

1279
00:51:50,721 --> 00:51:52,190
him,
like someone like him,

1280
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:54,100
but they dial it back a little bit.
Yeah,

1281
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,100
yeah.
Maybe so.

1282
00:51:55,101 --> 00:51:56,150
I just think people always say,
well,

1283
00:51:56,151 --> 00:51:58,580
this will be a course correction and
we're going to go back to having really

1284
00:51:58,581 --> 00:51:59,770
respond and I'm thinking,
wow,

1285
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:00,920
this is America.
Don't,

1286
00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:02,300
don't,
don't,

1287
00:52:02,301 --> 00:52:04,730
don't imagine that it could actually get
better in that regard.

1288
00:52:04,731 --> 00:52:07,340
We could be even more dysfunctional from
a political point of view,

1289
00:52:07,341 --> 00:52:11,620
but what's weird is I was watching this
interview today where this guy is

1290
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:16,660
fucking pencil neck dork was supporting
and Tif of violence and saying that the

1291
00:52:17,571 --> 00:52:20,360
only way to fight against fascism is
violence.

1292
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,160
And I was like,
oh Jesus.

1293
00:52:22,161 --> 00:52:25,010
And then there was this other guy next
to him who was saying,

1294
00:52:25,011 --> 00:52:26,630
no,
that's not true.

1295
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:30,170
The way you fight it is with a peaceful
protest like just happened in Boston.

1296
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:32,360
Like that's the best way to handle it.
Where there was,

1297
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:36,140
I want to say there was more than
100,000 people in Boston wasn't there

1298
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,080
was how many people in Boston came out.
Let's see if we could find that out,

1299
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:41,210
and it was completely peaceful in the
the.

1300
00:52:41,470 --> 00:52:45,380
I think there was like 400 retards with
KKK banners.

1301
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:50,480
It's a small,
small group of assholes and you're like,

1302
00:52:50,481 --> 00:52:52,100
okay,
but here's the thing.

1303
00:52:52,101 --> 00:52:54,020
This is where,
this is where the,

1304
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,970
you know,
president trump has just such a.

1305
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:58,520
he's a great case study at some point,
I'm sure.

1306
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:00,170
Well,
I'm sure people are already,

1307
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:02,750
you know,
writing up their grant proposals to do a

1308
00:53:02,751 --> 00:53:04,460
study on,
on his psychology.

1309
00:53:04,461 --> 00:53:06,350
But you know,
you look at,

1310
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:12,020
you look at at the first amendment and
you think if you like the first

1311
00:53:12,021 --> 00:53:13,910
amendment,
then you got to be all in,

1312
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,380
right?
It's not like you can say,

1313
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:17,330
and that's the kind of the beauty of
this country.

1314
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:21,500
You got to let that a douchebag speak.
Right?

1315
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:23,660
And that's what it is.
It's speech.

1316
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:26,160
But we've gotten to the point now

1317
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,880
words some by some folks are viewed as
violence.

1318
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:31,590
Words aren't violence.
I don't think.

1319
00:53:31,591 --> 00:53:33,570
This is just my own personal opinion.
Boards on violence,

1320
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:37,500
you gotta let everybody speak because
that's the first amendment.

1321
00:53:37,501 --> 00:53:38,580
You,
you'd go down and they don't want to

1322
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:41,160
pick and choose in slope,
slippery slope.

1323
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:42,023
Right?
And so,

1324
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:44,110
you know,
we,

1325
00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:47,520
we can all agree that there is no space
for them.

1326
00:53:47,521 --> 00:53:51,700
They're assholes,
but there's also no space for violent

1327
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:57,210
counter demonstration.
There is space for protesting it because

1328
00:53:57,211 --> 00:53:59,160
it's,
they're absolutely wrong.

1329
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:00,000
Right?
I mean,

1330
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,620
that's,
that's again,

1331
00:54:01,621 --> 00:54:05,190
this idea that you,
how you should be able to argue both,

1332
00:54:05,230 --> 00:54:06,210
right?
No,

1333
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:09,270
you can't respond with violence and yes,
you guys,

1334
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,370
you shouldn't,
you shouldn't be here.

1335
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:14,130
If you're going to hold those views,
that's,

1336
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:17,640
it's important.
You are protected by the first amendment

1337
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:22,760
and so that's fine.
Doesn't mean we have to like it or in

1338
00:54:23,491 --> 00:54:24,810
any way condone it,
but,

1339
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:28,740
but you get an okay that those sort of
fringe ideas are going to exist.

1340
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:32,970
And I agree the best way to resolve it
is peaceful demonstrations,

1341
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:36,330
massive pieces does demonstrations to
show,

1342
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:38,610
you know,
sort of the weight of where the good

1343
00:54:38,611 --> 00:54:42,810
thoughts are and then a political
process,

1344
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:44,520
right.
And sure that,

1345
00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:46,470
you know,
work through the political system as

1346
00:54:46,471 --> 00:54:48,180
dysfunctional as it may be.
But anyway,

1347
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:49,323
uh,

1348
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:54,450
just encouraging people to violently
attack people that have differing ideas

1349
00:54:54,451 --> 00:54:57,300
in them that aren't being violent is
never the answer.

1350
00:54:57,330 --> 00:54:59,190
No,
it's just not the way to do it.

1351
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:01,510
And that's just the approach to.
Yes,

1352
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:05,270
you're right,
it takes a fascist approach.

1353
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:07,590
Yeah.
I mean literally you're enforcing your

1354
00:55:07,591 --> 00:55:10,380
ideas to the point where you're
silencing others with actual violence.

1355
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:15,410
The mark of a totalitarian state also is
if you say you can't have these views,

1356
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:19,220
will get that to hate those views.
But again,

1357
00:55:19,221 --> 00:55:21,650
it's the idea that what you say is
violent to me.

1358
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:22,551
No,
it's not.

1359
00:55:22,551 --> 00:55:25,250
It's fucking speech.
The other thing that trump fucked up,

1360
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,310
he called those protesters.
Anti violent protesters.

1361
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:30,900
Like anti-police protesters.
Yeah.

1362
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:31,920
Like,
come on

1363
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:34,380
man.
That is not what they're protesting

1364
00:55:34,381 --> 00:55:38,220
against police.
There might be a few amongst them that

1365
00:55:38,221 --> 00:55:39,120
say stupid shit.

1366
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:40,980
But,
but again,

1367
00:55:40,981 --> 00:55:43,530
just like with the other side where
you've got what do you,

1368
00:55:43,531 --> 00:55:44,600
what do you got?
A $100,

1369
00:55:44,601 --> 00:55:48,330
$200.
Who would imagine $15,000?

1370
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,730
What the fuck are these Nazis hiding?
Anyway,

1371
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:51,810
that's it.
That's the thing.

1372
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:53,310
You know,
my dad didn't,

1373
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:55,210
didn't fly in World War Two,
you know,

1374
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:58,380
so that somehow you could have a
resurgent,

1375
00:55:58,381 --> 00:56:00,360
not that there is,
I think it's a small group just like

1376
00:56:00,361 --> 00:56:05,010
it's a small group on the left that
wants a violence solution to this or you

1377
00:56:05,011 --> 00:56:07,290
know,
honestly believes that violence against

1378
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:10,230
police is somehow the answer,
which is insane.

1379
00:56:10,231 --> 00:56:11,440
But,
um,

1380
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:12,960
again,
there you go.

1381
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:14,700
Truth is somewhere in the middle,
right?

1382
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:19,600
I mean,
they've got to get rid of the fringe and

1383
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:22,950
you know,
we got to figure out a way for the folks

1384
00:56:22,951 --> 00:56:25,620
that are in Canada.
Summoned space.

1385
00:56:25,621 --> 00:56:26,860
Yeah.
I have to work together.

1386
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:28,930
Otherwise,
I mean a,

1387
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,980
I don't think the Democrats care whether
Republicans gave.

1388
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:31,990
In fact they are,
they're happy.

1389
00:56:31,991 --> 00:56:35,710
That shit's not getting done.
But as an American,

1390
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,780
again,
I didn't vote for him.

1391
00:56:37,781 --> 00:56:40,420
I didn't vote for her,
but I would like to see the government

1392
00:56:40,421 --> 00:56:41,920
work now.
Who did you vote for?

1393
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:43,061
A.
You know what?

1394
00:56:43,061 --> 00:56:43,810
I just said,
fuck it.

1395
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:45,450
I can't.
I couldn't youtube.

1396
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:48,580
I know I couldn't bring myself to do it.
I couldn't bring us and I hated doing

1397
00:56:48,581 --> 00:56:49,414
that.
Right.

1398
00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:52,840
Because I voted top down right now,
what they call it.

1399
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:53,550
Yeah,
yeah,

1400
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:53,970
yeah.
I mean,

1401
00:56:53,970 --> 00:56:55,020
I,
what I did was I,

1402
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:57,940
you know,
state elections important,

1403
00:56:57,941 --> 00:56:58,570
you know,
those sort of.

1404
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:00,410
And that's fine,
but it,

1405
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:00,860
it,
uh,

1406
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:03,610
it's very painful to say I can't,
you know,

1407
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:07,720
can't justify doing that and uh,
and I know people and then people lose

1408
00:57:07,721 --> 00:57:08,560
their minds and they go,
well,

1409
00:57:08,561 --> 00:57:10,360
that means you have voted for him or
that means.

1410
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:14,860
And I know it just means we should have
been able to do better in a country this

1411
00:57:14,861 --> 00:57:15,880
size,
you know,

1412
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:17,620
and um,
you know,

1413
00:57:17,621 --> 00:57:21,130
maybe maybe you hold your nose and vote
for the other side.

1414
00:57:21,131 --> 00:57:22,540
I don't know.
Um,

1415
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:26,830
but at least she represented a
conventional approach to politics.

1416
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:28,710
That's true.
There's no doubt about that.

1417
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:32,590
That's super conventional.
I don't enjoy a lot of aspects of her

1418
00:57:32,591 --> 00:57:37,450
personality and what she's done with her
career and the obvious deception.

1419
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:42,610
The Clinton Foundation,
which is just riddled with problems and

1420
00:57:42,611 --> 00:57:47,240
now doesn't even exist anymore.
Apparently they shut it down to wonder

1421
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:52,260
what they did with the remaining balance
as a horror is flying in from Russia.

1422
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:55,990
What are we going to deal with this?
We got all this money.

1423
00:57:55,991 --> 00:58:00,440
We're got to transfer it somewhere.
There's got to be a place to store it in

1424
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:05,700
my pants,
wad up hundreds stuff and I'm in his

1425
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:07,780
past.

1426
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:09,850
He was,
he was in a marriage or is.

1427
00:58:09,851 --> 00:58:11,700
I guess he's not dead yet,
so I don't want to kill them off,

1428
00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:12,543
but he's,
he's,

1429
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:17,230
he's an amazing political individual.
That guy could make you think that,

1430
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:20,530
you know,
I met him once overseas is sounds dodgy,

1431
00:58:20,531 --> 00:58:25,531
but in the Saudi at a,
a party that does sound really sketching

1432
00:58:26,610 --> 00:58:29,440
and so.
But he had that ability right now again,

1433
00:58:29,441 --> 00:58:30,470
I wasn't a fan.
That's,

1434
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:31,361
but I,
you know,

1435
00:58:31,361 --> 00:58:34,030
again,
you just want whichever administration

1436
00:58:34,031 --> 00:58:36,640
is in charge.
You want it to work you from country to

1437
00:58:36,641 --> 00:58:38,000
move forward.
But yeah.

1438
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:40,930
But so you met him in it and it's true
what people used to say about them,

1439
00:58:40,931 --> 00:58:45,820
which is that he made you feel like he
was talking right to you and nothing

1440
00:58:45,821 --> 00:58:47,050
else was important.
Right.

1441
00:58:47,051 --> 00:58:49,180
He wasn't one of those guys that looks
over their shoulder thinking,

1442
00:58:49,181 --> 00:58:53,800
ms dot somebody else.
I should be talking to over there and he

1443
00:58:53,801 --> 00:58:58,210
was a charmer friend of mine told me he
was talking to him and a woman though

1444
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:03,540
and Clinton like essentially almost
turned his back to him and like all the

1445
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:09,210
horse out of the picture.
Then he just pressed gun.

1446
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:13,180
I'm just gonna Block you right here.
So these honors,

1447
00:59:13,181 --> 00:59:17,830
I got a stack name a pockets man in a
party.

1448
00:59:18,110 --> 00:59:22,160
A party in Saudi.
Get drunk

1449
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,210
with that dude.
Yeah,

1450
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:25,990
I'll tell you what's.
I mean George Bush.

1451
00:59:25,991 --> 00:59:28,880
That'd be a guy like to sit down and
have a beer with the Bush family.

1452
00:59:28,881 --> 00:59:30,080
Good bunch.
But I know people that go,

1453
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:31,610
oh my God,
I couldn't stand with policies.

1454
00:59:31,611 --> 00:59:33,580
But you know,
sometimes you just,

1455
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:35,510
it comes down to a personal thing and
you think,

1456
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:36,321
yeah,
you know,

1457
00:59:36,321 --> 00:59:38,300
maybe the guy's got some,
you know you made.

1458
00:59:38,301 --> 00:59:39,550
I like his principles.
You may have,

1459
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,100
but he sticks with them.
Right?

1460
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,630
He looks extremely reasonable now.
Yeah,

1461
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:47,240
exactly right.
One time where the supreme court had a

1462
00:59:47,241 --> 00:59:50,870
ruling that he didn't like and there was
a speech where he gave in the.

1463
00:59:50,990 --> 00:59:54,350
I've seen it quoted in print and then
someone showed a video of it,

1464
00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:56,300
but he was essentially saying,
well,

1465
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:58,430
you know,
we have to uphold the decision of the

1466
00:59:58,431 --> 00:59:59,110
court,
you know,

1467
00:59:59,110 --> 01:00:01,490
I'm not happy with it,
but you know,

1468
01:00:01,491 --> 01:00:03,350
this is uh,
the way our system works.

1469
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:07,970
And then it went to trump talking about
the supreme court,

1470
01:00:07,990 --> 01:00:10,640
you know,
not backing his travel ban and all the

1471
01:00:10,641 --> 01:00:14,330
different various things that he's lost
in court and he just goes out and he

1472
01:00:14,331 --> 01:00:18,410
just said,
and I just like the personal attacks and

1473
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:21,080
there's no product,
there's no discipline in the White

1474
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:21,271
House.
And,

1475
01:00:21,271 --> 01:00:22,850
and I know that everybody thought,
well,

1476
01:00:22,851 --> 01:00:24,940
let's get something different in there.
Let's get a businessman.

1477
01:00:24,941 --> 01:00:26,490
Let's,
we don't want the politics as usual.

1478
01:00:26,491 --> 01:00:29,930
And well you got that,
but there is a requirement.

1479
01:00:29,931 --> 01:00:33,980
There is a need for the machine to work
in a certain fashion and in a sense.

1480
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:34,941
And yet,
you know,

1481
01:00:34,941 --> 01:00:36,470
yes,
there's lots of things you can change

1482
01:00:36,471 --> 01:00:38,840
and that that's a good thing.
There should be some change in the

1483
01:00:39,050 --> 01:00:41,960
government,
but the way the place works in

1484
01:00:41,961 --> 01:00:44,840
Washington,
but the communications there that the

1485
01:00:44,841 --> 01:00:46,700
lack of discipline,
I mean for crying out loud,

1486
01:00:46,701 --> 01:00:48,590
they just,
they just put in place the new

1487
01:00:48,591 --> 01:00:50,120
communications director at the White
House,

1488
01:00:50,121 --> 01:00:51,050
28 years old.

1489
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:53,870
She's 28 years old,
never done this sort of thing before.

1490
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:55,820
And she's the new communications
director.

1491
01:00:55,821 --> 01:00:59,000
She replaced Scaramucci for his 10 days
of rain.

1492
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:00,390
And why did she,
um,

1493
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,090
wanted to replace him?
Because she listens.

1494
01:01:02,210 --> 01:01:04,160
She's just willing to do what trump
says.

1495
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:05,450
He just said,
yeah,

1496
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:07,260
I'm here for the job.
I mean,

1497
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,090
she says you're the girl for,
you know,

1498
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:10,010
for this.
And she's,

1499
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:14,960
she's worked within the trump
organization and I guess just viewed as

1500
01:01:14,961 --> 01:01:15,980
loyal.
Loyal.

1501
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:17,021
Yeah.
That's what he needs.

1502
01:01:17,021 --> 01:01:19,460
Yeah.
He needs loyalty above all else.

1503
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:20,353
Yeah.
And so,

1504
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:21,500
so that's it,
but I mean,

1505
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:24,320
there's no consistency and you see these
things happen.

1506
01:01:24,321 --> 01:01:25,370
You'll see,
you know,

1507
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:28,060
these,
the messaging get out and he gets ahead

1508
01:01:28,070 --> 01:01:30,290
of the message or they need to play
catch up then.

1509
01:01:30,291 --> 01:01:34,340
And people like Madison,
John Kelly now and Pompeo and others are

1510
01:01:34,341 --> 01:01:39,341
trying to race to make sense of some of
these things and they just self

1511
01:01:39,381 --> 01:01:42,180
inflicted wound after,
after wound for this,

1512
01:01:42,210 --> 01:01:45,890
this administration,
it seems like one of those homemade

1513
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:48,800
derby carts that they rolled down the
hill where you know,

1514
01:01:48,801 --> 01:01:52,010
the wheels aren't going to stay on and
you kinda can't look away.

1515
01:01:52,010 --> 01:01:52,581
Like,
wow,

1516
01:01:52,581 --> 01:01:55,520
how long is it going to take for this
thing completely falls apart,

1517
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:57,620
start doing tumbles down the hill.
You got a name,

1518
01:01:57,621 --> 01:01:59,270
they get it.
You got to come up with a name for that

1519
01:01:59,271 --> 01:02:01,970
cart is have the name,
your soapbox derby cars.

1520
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:03,770
But um,
yeah,

1521
01:02:03,771 --> 01:02:04,360
I,
I don't,

1522
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:08,900
I don't know where it's going to go.
I just think I'm the guy who has been in

1523
01:02:08,901 --> 01:02:12,380
the intelligence community for so many
years and you're stepping back and there

1524
01:02:12,381 --> 01:02:16,910
was also a real issue with him being at
odds with the intelligence community and

1525
01:02:16,970 --> 01:02:19,350
diminishing the intelligence community.
Yeah.

1526
01:02:19,351 --> 01:02:21,780
That was a strange error.
Sort of an interesting narrative.

1527
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:26,560
It didn't really.
It got overblown to some degree.

1528
01:02:26,561 --> 01:02:28,860
I mean the people in the sense that the
people at the agency,

1529
01:02:28,930 --> 01:02:30,480
you know,
at the end of the day,

1530
01:02:30,481 --> 01:02:34,050
they just take whoever's in charge.
They take their marching orders from,

1531
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:34,560
right.

1532
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:36,450
It's not,
and I know people don't believe it

1533
01:02:36,451 --> 01:02:38,790
because you know,
everybody likes to feature films and

1534
01:02:38,791 --> 01:02:39,341
everything,
but it's,

1535
01:02:39,341 --> 01:02:43,110
it's a pretty apolitical organization.
Whoever's in the administration,

1536
01:02:43,111 --> 01:02:45,540
they're going to prioritize their
national security concerns.

1537
01:02:45,870 --> 01:02:50,070
You're tasking comes out of that and
then you just march on and do your job.

1538
01:02:50,370 --> 01:02:53,750
And yes,
the is an appointed position and you

1539
01:02:53,751 --> 01:02:55,500
know,
John Brennan was certainly much more

1540
01:02:55,501 --> 01:02:57,180
political in the previous administration
than,

1541
01:02:57,210 --> 01:03:00,300
than a previous directors have been.
But,

1542
01:03:00,530 --> 01:03:04,500
and the operational level,
the street level people just get on with

1543
01:03:04,501 --> 01:03:04,891
it,
you know,

1544
01:03:04,891 --> 01:03:05,850
they're human.
So of course,

1545
01:03:05,851 --> 01:03:07,230
you know,
they may have their own personal

1546
01:03:07,231 --> 01:03:08,820
preference,
but I spent a long time.

1547
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:12,110
They're in behind the curtain and,
and you know,

1548
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:14,580
they just tick on and do whatever.
You know.

1549
01:03:14,581 --> 01:03:16,230
There were people that weren't happy
with Obama.

1550
01:03:16,231 --> 01:03:18,480
There are people that weren't happy with
Bush to people not happy with trump.

1551
01:03:18,510 --> 01:03:21,240
That doesn't just tell us what the
priorities are,

1552
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:23,560
tell us what the task is and we'll get
on with it,

1553
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:25,800
you know,
go out there and do the collection

1554
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:31,280
operations we're supposed to do.
It just seems like there's no one person

1555
01:03:31,621 --> 01:03:33,930
that's ever going to be able to fill
that position.

1556
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:36,470
It seems like that position also gets
bigger and bigger,

1557
01:03:36,471 --> 01:03:39,190
like the responsibilities get bigger and
bigger and the president's.

1558
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:39,880
Yeah,
yeah,

1559
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:40,561
yeah.
I just,

1560
01:03:40,561 --> 01:03:43,100
it seems to me that at this point in
our,

1561
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:45,390
our,
our history,

1562
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:49,080
the history of our society,
we kind of have to look at that position

1563
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:53,430
and wonder whether or not it's even
logical to give so much power to one

1564
01:03:53,431 --> 01:03:54,710
person.
It was like,

1565
01:03:55,170 --> 01:03:55,951
what would you do?
I mean,

1566
01:03:55,951 --> 01:03:57,060
how do you have a good question?
Yeah.

1567
01:03:57,061 --> 01:04:00,130
How do you create a Council of Elders
Council?

1568
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:06,750
Everybody sits around like a hand carved
desk in a underground layer and makes

1569
01:04:06,751 --> 01:04:08,580
decisions.
That's a good.

1570
01:04:08,590 --> 01:04:09,301
Yeah,
I like it.

1571
01:04:09,301 --> 01:04:10,770
Yeah.
It could be like the knights of the

1572
01:04:10,771 --> 01:04:12,060
round table,
but I think it's.

1573
01:04:12,061 --> 01:04:12,840
Yeah.
You know,

1574
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:16,200
I don't know.
I think virtuous people by committee.

1575
01:04:16,201 --> 01:04:17,610
I wonder if the founding fathers,
you know,

1576
01:04:17,611 --> 01:04:18,810
I'm sure there's been all,
you know,

1577
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:20,580
reporting on that,
I just never read it,

1578
01:04:20,581 --> 01:04:22,890
but the founding fathers,
have they considered that as an option,

1579
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:24,600
as an option?
Probably not,

1580
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:28,470
but a wonderful committee.
The kind of population growth that we've

1581
01:04:28,471 --> 01:04:30,480
experienced here,
the real problem with the founding

1582
01:04:30,481 --> 01:04:33,600
fathers is as brilliant as they were.
There's no way that could have ever seen

1583
01:04:33,601 --> 01:04:37,140
the internet coming now,
and this is what could they have seen

1584
01:04:37,141 --> 01:04:39,930
the people wanting to stay in Washington
for 36 years,

1585
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:42,450
42 years.
I've become career politicians.

1586
01:04:42,450 --> 01:04:43,900
They were all just interested in,
in,

1587
01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:45,930
you know,
doing their duty and serving the way

1588
01:04:45,931 --> 01:04:48,510
they were supposed to or they felt
obligated to and then getting the hell

1589
01:04:48,511 --> 01:04:48,990
out.
Right.

1590
01:04:48,990 --> 01:04:52,410
Getting back to the farm or whatever
that job was because nobody wanted to

1591
01:04:52,411 --> 01:04:54,600
stay in Washington for any longer than
they needed to.

1592
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:55,920
So yeah,
you're right.

1593
01:04:55,921 --> 01:04:57,150
They could,
they have foreseen all.

1594
01:04:57,530 --> 01:04:58,470
No,
definitely not.

1595
01:04:58,471 --> 01:05:01,740
And so does that mean,
what does that mean though?

1596
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:06,660
It means amendments to the Constitution
and as we've done in the past and think

1597
01:05:06,661 --> 01:05:11,661
about how crazy it is that someone forms
a new country and then 400 plus years

1598
01:05:13,291 --> 01:05:16,320
later,
it is the preeminent superpower in the

1599
01:05:16,321 --> 01:05:17,900
world by far.
Yeah,

1600
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,350
that's pretty crazy.
You got these countries that have been

1601
01:05:20,351 --> 01:05:22,480
around for thousands and thousands of
years,

1602
01:05:22,870 --> 01:05:27,870
like imagine a group of freaks and
misfits that branch off from America,

1603
01:05:28,001 --> 01:05:32,050
getting a boat and float over to Costa
Rica or wherever and take it over.

1604
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:33,070
Yeah.
And then,

1605
01:05:33,070 --> 01:05:35,490
uh,
and then it becomes the superpower.

1606
01:05:35,580 --> 01:05:36,780
It is astounding.
And then again,

1607
01:05:36,781 --> 01:05:39,390
going back to what we talked about
towards the beginning was cobbling it

1608
01:05:39,391 --> 01:05:43,230
together and understanding that we
needed to get our hands on everything

1609
01:05:43,231 --> 01:05:44,720
west of the Mississippi.
Now,

1610
01:05:44,970 --> 01:05:47,580
clearly there were some issues there,
but you know,

1611
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:50,410
it's sort of that vision that says we're
going all the way to the causeway.

1612
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:51,600
The water we have to.
It was,

1613
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:52,630
we can control it.
Right.

1614
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:53,730
And that's,
I mean,

1615
01:05:53,731 --> 01:05:54,450
it's,
it's,

1616
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:56,400
it's an astounding history.
You're absolutely right.

1617
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:57,330
Um,
but,

1618
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:00,240
you know,
it'll be interesting to see.

1619
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:03,030
Obviously this is the probably the
stupidest statement people will hear it

1620
01:06:03,031 --> 01:06:05,090
all day is,
is you know where we're going to be in

1621
01:06:05,230 --> 01:06:08,820
say another 200 years because I've got a
theory that says we're.

1622
01:06:09,270 --> 01:06:13,470
Every generation is making it easier for
their kids and eventually you hit a

1623
01:06:13,471 --> 01:06:17,880
point of diminishing returns and
everybody's just a big pussy and so

1624
01:06:17,970 --> 01:06:20,580
that's my theory.
I haven't come up with a name for it.

1625
01:06:20,581 --> 01:06:21,780
You're not alone.
Yeah,

1626
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:23,900
a big pussy pussy.
That's.

1627
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:26,690
That could cover different things.
So yeah.

1628
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:30,450
Plus that was great.
That was a great show.

1629
01:06:30,550 --> 01:06:31,480
Wonder.
Yeah.

1630
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:35,140
I wonder how much there's going to be.
There are parts of the world where

1631
01:06:35,141 --> 01:06:38,200
obviously things are way more difficult
than are here and maybe we're losing

1632
01:06:38,201 --> 01:06:43,090
some sort of a competitive edge because
we've made our lives so easy and haven't

1633
01:06:43,091 --> 01:06:48,091
replaced the convenience of civilization
with something that tempers are human

1634
01:06:49,481 --> 01:06:51,640
instincts,
like some difficult tasks,

1635
01:06:51,790 --> 01:06:53,800
right?
Of passage for young men,

1636
01:06:54,090 --> 01:06:56,020
you know,
something that develops character.

1637
01:06:56,021 --> 01:07:00,130
Instead we're making safe spaces and
making words,

1638
01:07:00,131 --> 01:07:04,750
violence and you know,
making it so we have trigger warnings

1639
01:07:04,751 --> 01:07:05,190
and

1640
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:07,450
no winters.
Winter when we don't have to,

1641
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:09,920
when,
thank God my kids are getting old enough

1642
01:07:09,921 --> 01:07:11,510
now where their sports leagues no
longer,

1643
01:07:11,930 --> 01:07:14,270
you know,
for awhile there I was just driving me

1644
01:07:14,271 --> 01:07:16,610
crazy.
So it was parent go into a game and

1645
01:07:16,670 --> 01:07:20,570
realizing that they weren't keeping
score because they didn't want to hurt

1646
01:07:20,571 --> 01:07:23,780
anybody's feelings.
That's the whole reason why people get

1647
01:07:23,781 --> 01:07:24,920
better.
You fucked me.

1648
01:07:24,930 --> 01:07:27,680
And while the kids are keeping score,
the kids know for sure and kids don't

1649
01:07:27,681 --> 01:07:29,420
want you to blow smoke up their ass,
right?

1650
01:07:29,421 --> 01:07:32,090
You don't want to.
They'd come off the court and if you

1651
01:07:32,091 --> 01:07:34,790
know the,
the oldest boy a scooter,

1652
01:07:34,791 --> 01:07:37,310
he 10 years old and he's,
he plays a lot of Lacrosse.

1653
01:07:37,311 --> 01:07:39,230
He's been playing for five years and so
he's,

1654
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:40,640
he really likes it.
And he does.

1655
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:41,930
He does well.
But you know,

1656
01:07:41,931 --> 01:07:44,600
I'm not raising the Division One
champion there,

1657
01:07:44,601 --> 01:07:45,434
right?

1658
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:48,730
But he plays other sports too.
So there's sort of a well roundedness

1659
01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:50,750
day.
But we came off the field one day and we

1660
01:07:50,751 --> 01:07:52,800
were walking along and,
and uh,

1661
01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:53,511
they,
all,

1662
01:07:53,511 --> 01:07:57,170
the parents were kind of marching off
and the game was over and he says,

1663
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:58,401
he says,
how'd I do?

1664
01:07:58,401 --> 01:07:59,234
And I said,
well,

1665
01:07:59,270 --> 01:08:00,800
you know,
you could've done better.

1666
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,030
Um,
I said,

1667
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:05,090
I just get the impression you didn't try
as hard as you could,

1668
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:07,100
what do you think?
And he looked at me,

1669
01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:09,200
irritated.
He looked at me like,

1670
01:08:09,201 --> 01:08:10,730
I can't believe you didn't just say I
did great.

1671
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:14,540
And so he said what?
And I looked at him,

1672
01:08:14,541 --> 01:08:17,130
I'm walking and I didn't realize the
parents were within earshot.

1673
01:08:17,210 --> 01:08:17,920
And I said,
well look,

1674
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:18,570
you know,
school,

1675
01:08:18,570 --> 01:08:20,210
do you want me to blow smoke up your
ass?

1676
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:23,210
Do you want me to be honest with you?
And to his credit,

1677
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:25,490
he said,
be honest with me even though it wasn't

1678
01:08:25,491 --> 01:08:26,570
happy about it,
the honesty.

1679
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:29,040
So you just be honest with me.
And so we,

1680
01:08:29,090 --> 01:08:31,970
we tell kids that they know better.
You know,

1681
01:08:31,971 --> 01:08:35,480
if you tell a kid that they're great and
they're doing wonderful and they didn't,

1682
01:08:36,110 --> 01:08:39,140
what do they take away from that?
They take away from it that you're kind

1683
01:08:39,141 --> 01:08:42,380
of bullshitting them unless they're just
super,

1684
01:08:42,381 --> 01:08:43,770
super young.
They're pretty.

1685
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,320
They get it at a pretty early age.

1686
01:08:45,650 --> 01:08:46,240
Well,
here's,

1687
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:50,950
here's something that's important to
relate to children that you are not your

1688
01:08:50,951 --> 01:08:52,900
accomplishments.
You are you,

1689
01:08:52,990 --> 01:08:57,400
and the only way you're going to get
better at accomplishing things is to be

1690
01:08:57,540 --> 01:09:02,170
100 percent honest about the amount of
effort you put in and what the actual

1691
01:09:02,171 --> 01:09:06,820
result of that effort is.
Whether it's a failure or a success that

1692
01:09:06,821 --> 01:09:10,570
does not define you,
that defines your participation in this

1693
01:09:10,571 --> 01:09:12,700
particular activity.
It is not you.

1694
01:09:12,910 --> 01:09:16,630
You are an individual that will
hopefully learn from all of your

1695
01:09:16,631 --> 01:09:19,630
endeavors,
but you're never going to learn shit if

1696
01:09:19,631 --> 01:09:22,360
you lie to yourself.
He never going to learn shit.

1697
01:09:22,570 --> 01:09:26,050
If somebody makes this nobody's scores
employment and there are no winners and

1698
01:09:26,051 --> 01:09:30,770
there are no losers and everybody's
amazing that that's not good because it

1699
01:09:30,771 --> 01:09:31,511
gives voice.
By the way,

1700
01:09:31,511 --> 01:09:35,680
it's not good because there's going to
be people out there that are fucking

1701
01:09:35,681 --> 01:09:38,590
driven and psychotic and they're going
to get ahead.

1702
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:42,430
There's people that are task oriented
and goal oriented it and they they have

1703
01:09:42,431 --> 01:09:45,760
an idea ahead of them are going to try
to figure out how to make this happen.

1704
01:09:45,910 --> 01:09:47,500
They have a goal,
they want to reach it,

1705
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:51,610
and if you're competing with that person
in any form of life and they're not

1706
01:09:51,611 --> 01:09:56,590
burdened down by the bullshit that we
give so many kids today,

1707
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,980
they're going to have a massive
advantage and this idea that this kid

1708
01:09:59,981 --> 01:10:03,070
who's been coddled and treated like he's
always going to be a winner,

1709
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:06,250
that somehow or another they're going to
be happier is fucking crazy.

1710
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:11,920
Kid can't process what's true and what's
not and the kid can't process criticism,

1711
01:10:12,580 --> 01:10:13,830
constructive criticism,
right?

1712
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,430
You don't just stand there and berate
you're kid.

1713
01:10:15,431 --> 01:10:17,950
Of course.
That's just as bad as the other.

1714
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:18,280
Yeah.
No,

1715
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:19,940
absolutely.
The guys that stand on it and

1716
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:20,910
everybody's seen them.
Right.

1717
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:23,230
That the Dads,
sometimes moms that stayed on the

1718
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:27,490
sideline and berate their kid because
kids jeopardizing his scholarship to

1719
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,050
some more on school.
Yeah,

1720
01:10:29,140 --> 01:10:30,490
morons,
but no,

1721
01:10:30,610 --> 01:10:31,443
I think

1722
01:10:31,990 --> 01:10:33,400
you're absolutely right.
They've got.

1723
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:38,400
The sooner they're able to assess that,
that equation effort,

1724
01:10:38,650 --> 01:10:43,650
a end result and compare it to what's
going on around them and then understand

1725
01:10:44,791 --> 01:10:45,820
it.
I'm gonna say what am I?

1726
01:10:45,970 --> 01:10:47,640
And then one of my boys,
you know,

1727
01:10:47,641 --> 01:10:52,641
they play basketball and
they enjoy it,

1728
01:10:53,551 --> 01:10:55,920
but it's not their primary activity
right now.

1729
01:10:56,310 --> 01:11:00,670
So they tried out for a year and they
got and um,

1730
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:05,780
but not at the top team and they were
upset about not being placed on this top

1731
01:11:07,951 --> 01:11:09,390
team.
And I said,

1732
01:11:09,391 --> 01:11:10,870
you don't,
I did.

1733
01:11:10,871 --> 01:11:12,430
And I didn't say it quite this way,
but my,

1734
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:13,590
my,
my point was,

1735
01:11:13,591 --> 01:11:14,190
you don't deserve

1736
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:18,420
to be on the top 10 because you're not
working as hard as those kids that are

1737
01:11:18,421 --> 01:11:20,310
working hard.
And that's their thing.

1738
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:23,040
They wanted to be there.
And so they put in the effort,

1739
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:26,670
you are happy playing and you could,
you could be there,

1740
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,150
but you're not doing it yet.
And so therefore,

1741
01:11:30,151 --> 01:11:31,200
you know,
hey,

1742
01:11:31,201 --> 01:11:33,150
don't get down on yourself,
but b,

1743
01:11:33,151 --> 01:11:36,090
don't certainly don't get down on
anybody else because they put out the

1744
01:11:36,091 --> 01:11:38,580
effort and they accomplished something
that you didn't.

1745
01:11:38,890 --> 01:11:42,240
So you know,
you always trying to find that balance.

1746
01:11:42,241 --> 01:11:44,430
It's just I don't,
we're not doing our kids any favors

1747
01:11:44,431 --> 01:11:45,340
right now.
I just think we're,

1748
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:47,790
we're not,
not obviously as a broad brush

1749
01:11:47,791 --> 01:11:49,950
statement,
but in general terms,

1750
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:54,810
I think society is not doing us any
favors.

1751
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:59,070
We're in and you see that I've got a
daughter that's in college and she talks

1752
01:11:59,071 --> 01:11:59,850
about her,
you know,

1753
01:11:59,850 --> 01:12:04,440
her classmates and others and you know,
sort of the conversations they have in

1754
01:12:04,441 --> 01:12:07,800
class and the discussions and what
passes as debate nowadays,

1755
01:12:07,801 --> 01:12:09,360
which is not much right.

1756
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,400
The idea of the old debate where you
can,

1757
01:12:11,430 --> 01:12:14,610
you can voice your opinions and they can
be different than somebody else's and

1758
01:12:14,611 --> 01:12:17,460
you can hash it out and you can have a
winner and a loser,

1759
01:12:17,461 --> 01:12:19,500
but that's fine.
You Go away and you come back the next

1760
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:22,980
day and you have another rousing debate
in that class doesn't really exist.

1761
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:24,450
You know,
it seems like anyway,

1762
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:28,680
because everybody's so afraid of saying
something that might be offensive or not

1763
01:12:28,681 --> 01:12:31,410
offensive,
but just might be upsetting.

1764
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:34,320
And there's a difference between being
upsetting and being offensive.

1765
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:37,890
We're trying to serve the world.
I mean that really was what we're trying

1766
01:12:37,891 --> 01:12:40,860
to.
All the hard edges that you might bruise

1767
01:12:40,861 --> 01:12:42,040
yourself on.
We're trying to push a,

1768
01:12:42,130 --> 01:12:44,220
put a cushion,
but you need to understand that when you

1769
01:12:44,221 --> 01:12:47,070
fall down,
it's going to hurt so that way next time

1770
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:50,280
you're thinking you might fall down,
you'll correct your path because the

1771
01:12:50,281 --> 01:12:53,070
whole reason why people do difficult
things,

1772
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:55,590
you do difficult things to understand
your boundaries,

1773
01:12:55,591 --> 01:12:58,470
to understand your limitations,
and then to try to improve those,

1774
01:12:58,740 --> 01:13:01,200
try to raise the roof on your
expectations,

1775
01:13:01,201 --> 01:13:02,610
raised the roof on your,
your,

1776
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:03,503
your,
whatever.

1777
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:07,050
Limitations of your abilities,
learn from whatever those are and

1778
01:13:07,051 --> 01:13:08,880
improve.
It's like interrogation training.

1779
01:13:08,881 --> 01:13:11,670
You would an interrogation training when
you're working with people.

1780
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:15,630
Um,
the goal is to show them that it's okay.

1781
01:13:15,631 --> 01:13:17,370
At some point they're going to have to
talk,

1782
01:13:17,450 --> 01:13:20,460
right?
And so when you're going through the

1783
01:13:20,461 --> 01:13:23,010
training,
the point of it is to get them to that

1784
01:13:23,011 --> 01:13:24,510
point.
They realized that,

1785
01:13:24,511 --> 01:13:25,400
okay,
you know,

1786
01:13:25,410 --> 01:13:28,050
it's not the end of the world.
I know that at some point I'm going to

1787
01:13:28,051 --> 01:13:29,160
end up talking,
right?

1788
01:13:29,260 --> 01:13:31,590
I'm going to say something,
I'm going to have to do that because I

1789
01:13:31,591 --> 01:13:33,810
can't,
otherwise I'm either dead or I'm

1790
01:13:33,811 --> 01:13:37,170
completely broken.
And the idea is if you do that and then

1791
01:13:37,171 --> 01:13:38,760
the rest of the training and,
and beyond that,

1792
01:13:38,761 --> 01:13:41,340
you're building them back up because
they understand that now if,

1793
01:13:41,490 --> 01:13:44,130
God forbid something should happen,
they get picked up and there's actually

1794
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:46,320
an interrogation going on in the back of
their mind.

1795
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:50,130
They understand that and they're able to
process it so that if they do get to

1796
01:13:50,131 --> 01:13:51,960
that point where now,
okay,

1797
01:13:51,961 --> 01:13:54,770
I'm going to have to talk.
I'm gonna have to come up with something

1798
01:13:54,790 --> 01:13:57,030
it's going to add.
And then it's not completely

1799
01:13:57,031 --> 01:13:58,020
devastating.
It doesn't,

1800
01:13:58,021 --> 01:14:00,150
you know,
leave them completely broken and they

1801
01:14:00,151 --> 01:14:02,670
can walk back because they understand.
I got to that point.

1802
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:04,660
I understand what my boundaries are.
Uh,

1803
01:14:04,830 --> 01:14:06,160
but I can work within that.
I,

1804
01:14:06,170 --> 01:14:07,970
I don't know where I'm going with this.
So that we're seeing,

1805
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,900
are you seeing turkeys and trading like
a,

1806
01:14:09,901 --> 01:14:13,540
an agent gets interrogated,
interrogation training in general for,

1807
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:15,400
for,
for our outfit,

1808
01:14:15,401 --> 01:14:17,530
for the military.
Basically the same.

1809
01:14:17,531 --> 01:14:20,830
We do a lot of cross training.
This is not interrogating an enemy

1810
01:14:20,850 --> 01:14:24,580
combatant,
you being going through interrogation

1811
01:14:24,581 --> 01:14:26,530
training,
so what do you tell them to do?

1812
01:14:26,550 --> 01:14:29,260
Like in that,
like say if someone gets captured in

1813
01:14:29,261 --> 01:14:32,920
Afghanistan or whatever happened,
whatever bottom line is,

1814
01:14:32,921 --> 01:14:33,491
you know,
you,

1815
01:14:33,491 --> 01:14:35,710
you,
you try to avoid talking,

1816
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:36,790
but it depends.

1817
01:14:36,790 --> 01:14:39,580
Part of it is you've got to assess who
you're dealing with,

1818
01:14:39,581 --> 01:14:40,900
right?
You've got to assess what you think

1819
01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:43,630
their parameters are.
What could be coming down the pike in

1820
01:14:43,631 --> 01:14:45,880
other words.
So how is this and that.

1821
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:48,310
That's part of the training too,
is understanding what different groups

1822
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:50,920
with different places could,
could mean.

1823
01:14:50,980 --> 01:14:53,200
What would that would,
that interrogation could look like,

1824
01:14:53,201 --> 01:14:56,050
how bad it could get?
So you're processing that.

1825
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:59,560
Part of it is understanding what it is.
It's okay to give up.

1826
01:14:59,561 --> 01:15:01,060
What are you,
what are you going to say that's not

1827
01:15:01,061 --> 01:15:04,300
going to put anything in jeopardy
anybody's lives or any operation or

1828
01:15:04,301 --> 01:15:05,830
anything in jeopardy.
Part of it is,

1829
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:08,080
you know,
you've then you've got to understand

1830
01:15:08,081 --> 01:15:09,910
that you got to stay close to the truth.
Right?

1831
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:13,210
The problem with it,
if you know where you start getting

1832
01:15:13,211 --> 01:15:17,050
people out on interrogations is where
they can't remember what they've said

1833
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:20,680
and the closer you are to the truth,
the easier it is to remember what you've

1834
01:15:20,681 --> 01:15:21,280
said.

1835
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:23,350
Right?
So in these things,

1836
01:15:23,351 --> 01:15:25,330
I mean,
if it's a bad situation and you're in

1837
01:15:25,331 --> 01:15:27,730
there day in and day out,
you know,

1838
01:15:27,731 --> 01:15:32,200
and your sleep deprivation and they're
knocking around and there's no food and

1839
01:15:32,201 --> 01:15:33,190
it's,
you're gonna have,

1840
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:36,430
you're gonna have a hard time keeping
track of even the basic things.

1841
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:38,500
So you know,
you're trying to keep it as close to the

1842
01:15:38,501 --> 01:15:41,050
truth as possible and as minimal as
possible.

1843
01:15:41,230 --> 01:15:42,030
You know,
in terms of,

1844
01:15:42,030 --> 01:15:43,420
of damage,
you go in,

1845
01:15:43,430 --> 01:15:45,030
you know,
typically you,

1846
01:15:45,210 --> 01:15:47,290
you've thought through all of this,
it's like everything else,

1847
01:15:47,291 --> 01:15:50,290
you do your homework ahead of time and
God forbid something should happen and

1848
01:15:50,370 --> 01:15:51,280
you know,
usually it won't.

1849
01:15:51,281 --> 01:15:53,170
But Anyway,
point being is that,

1850
01:15:53,230 --> 01:15:54,820
uh,
you know,

1851
01:15:54,821 --> 01:15:58,450
the ideas in the training portion of it,
you want people to understand that,

1852
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:00,580
you know,
everybody's got a breaking point,

1853
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:01,570
right?
And that's just,

1854
01:16:01,950 --> 01:16:03,060
that's the way it works.

1855
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:04,810
And someone's summits,
you know,

1856
01:16:04,811 --> 01:16:05,370
it's here,
so I'm,

1857
01:16:05,370 --> 01:16:09,880
it's further down the road,
but everybody's going to break and you

1858
01:16:09,881 --> 01:16:12,820
don't want that to devastate the person
if it should happen,

1859
01:16:12,970 --> 01:16:14,080
you know,
knock on wood.

1860
01:16:14,081 --> 01:16:16,660
But anyway,
that was apropos of nothing.

1861
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:17,673
Uh,
no,

1862
01:16:17,730 --> 01:16:19,060
it's important.
I mean,

1863
01:16:19,190 --> 01:16:24,190
it's an interesting topic because a mean
understanding that there's going to be

1864
01:16:25,151 --> 01:16:29,460
severe penalties and that there's going
to be repercussions there.

1865
01:16:29,730 --> 01:16:31,240
You know,
this is a,

1866
01:16:31,241 --> 01:16:35,170
this is a bad situation you're in and
understanding that going in is going to

1867
01:16:35,171 --> 01:16:38,050
help you a lot more than if you go in
there from,

1868
01:16:38,070 --> 01:16:38,950
you know,
a soft.

1869
01:16:39,270 --> 01:16:42,280
But how did world where you don't think
there's going to be any adversity

1870
01:16:42,281 --> 01:16:43,001
whatsoever.
No,

1871
01:16:43,001 --> 01:16:44,590
that's right.
And that's all we're,

1872
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:46,160
you know.
Um,

1873
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:50,590
just to finish that,
a thought is that the interesting thing

1874
01:16:50,591 --> 01:16:53,800
about people talked about the
interrogation program that we had

1875
01:16:53,801 --> 01:16:54,440
obviously,
right?

1876
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:56,280
And I don't want to revisit that.
And you know,

1877
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:59,560
the left at a very fine job of grabbing
the moral high ground and saying,

1878
01:16:59,561 --> 01:17:01,720
either you're talking to people or it's
all torture,

1879
01:17:02,140 --> 01:17:03,030
right?
Um,

1880
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:08,520
but the point being is that even if you
don't ever intend to use any enhanced

1881
01:17:09,621 --> 01:17:10,280
interrogation

1882
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:15,110
techniques,
you don't want to tell the enemy that

1883
01:17:15,590 --> 01:17:20,590
because once you tell them that you're
constrained by the army field manual as

1884
01:17:22,371 --> 01:17:23,900
an example,
that's all you can do.

1885
01:17:24,350 --> 01:17:28,100
Guess what?
Every milk out there fighting us and

1886
01:17:28,101 --> 01:17:30,830
wanting to harm us is carrying a copy of
the army field manual in their back

1887
01:17:30,831 --> 01:17:31,480
pocket.
They don't,

1888
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,620
you know,
despite despite the fact that they did

1889
01:17:33,621 --> 01:17:34,670
for a while,
they don't live in a cave.

1890
01:17:34,910 --> 01:17:39,770
And so once they know what's coming down
the pike that's gone,

1891
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:43,310
their incentive is gone right to talk to
you.

1892
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:46,580
Because once you know,
once you don't have that unknown,

1893
01:17:46,581 --> 01:17:48,590
if you're not sitting in some,
you know,

1894
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:53,000
a squat box and the temperature's up and
you haven't eaten and you're thinking,

1895
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:55,910
what the hell they got to do to me next?
You have no idea.

1896
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:59,540
If that's gone and you don't have that
anxiety,

1897
01:17:59,541 --> 01:18:02,910
that intense anxiety,
then you're okay with it.

1898
01:18:02,950 --> 01:18:04,450
Mentally,
you get yourself to a nice happy.

1899
01:18:04,830 --> 01:18:05,930
You're comfortable.
They're feeding,

1900
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:07,000
you know,
they're just asking you questions.

1901
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:08,630
They're just asking questions and
you're,

1902
01:18:08,631 --> 01:18:09,321
you know,
you can,

1903
01:18:09,321 --> 01:18:13,160
you can hold out for a much longer
period of time and yeah,

1904
01:18:13,161 --> 01:18:16,190
maybe there'll be some clever person
working in the interrogation facility

1905
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:18,590
and they'll develop a personal
relationship over a period of time,

1906
01:18:18,591 --> 01:18:19,580
you know,
but you know what,

1907
01:18:19,581 --> 01:18:22,490
by then your operational information is
lost.

1908
01:18:22,491 --> 01:18:23,450
It's interest,
right.

1909
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:28,070
And the shelf life on that stuff is,
is not particularly long typically.

1910
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:31,160
So he had a way that says,
yeah,

1911
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:33,660
when you,
when you're in a situation where you

1912
01:18:33,661 --> 01:18:36,630
have to extract information in a very
short period of time because it's

1913
01:18:36,631 --> 01:18:41,390
critical because lives are at stake,
like in taking time off and if you're

1914
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:45,600
stuck in some situation where someone's
got a dirty bomb or what have you,

1915
01:18:45,630 --> 01:18:47,490
there's a terrorist attack is being
planned,

1916
01:18:47,670 --> 01:18:49,440
you know,
this guy has some information.

1917
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:51,390
What is the best way to get it out of
them?

1918
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:53,010
Is there a best way?

1919
01:18:53,180 --> 01:18:54,440
Yes.
You know what does not really,

1920
01:18:54,450 --> 01:18:57,440
because it's all dependent on the
individual and that's where it's so much

1921
01:18:57,441 --> 01:18:59,900
of this and it just again,
the,

1922
01:18:59,910 --> 01:19:03,320
the,
the argument got sort of corrupted,

1923
01:19:03,321 --> 01:19:04,160
hijacked,
whatever.

1924
01:19:04,550 --> 01:19:07,760
Because of waterboarding,
because it just became such an emotive

1925
01:19:07,820 --> 01:19:08,950
issue,
uh,

1926
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:13,010
but it's an enormously labor intensive
process.

1927
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:15,410
Even in those cases where you think,
okay,

1928
01:19:15,411 --> 01:19:18,800
we've just picked up a high value target
and we feel that they've got operational

1929
01:19:18,801 --> 01:19:22,100
information that we really need to know,
uh,

1930
01:19:22,101 --> 01:19:24,340
related to whatever.
Um,

1931
01:19:24,830 --> 01:19:25,820
it's,
it's,

1932
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:28,550
it's not as if you don't go in there and
start beating them over the head with a

1933
01:19:28,551 --> 01:19:30,770
two by four and nobody,
nobody does that,

1934
01:19:30,950 --> 01:19:31,783
you know,
maybe some,

1935
01:19:31,970 --> 01:19:33,860
maybe some liaison partners,
you know,

1936
01:19:33,861 --> 01:19:34,370
in,
in,

1937
01:19:34,370 --> 01:19:35,690
in,
you know,

1938
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:37,440
fourth world countries,
you know,

1939
01:19:37,570 --> 01:19:41,360
would world fifth world.
What's the fifth world country?

1940
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:43,393
I'd never even heard of that.

1941
01:19:43,430 --> 01:19:47,240
New Jersey,
Connecticut,

1942
01:19:47,450 --> 01:19:51,170
Connecticut outside of Dan Malloy is the
president of the fifth World Nation of

1943
01:19:51,171 --> 01:19:52,510
Connecticut.
Um,

1944
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:54,600
so,
you know,

1945
01:19:54,620 --> 01:19:56,210
it's,
it's down to the individual is knowing

1946
01:19:56,211 --> 01:19:56,830
your homework.
It's,

1947
01:19:56,830 --> 01:19:59,660
it's having all the information that you
can at your fingertips about,

1948
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:01,750
okay,
well who is this person where the

1949
01:20:01,751 --> 01:20:03,980
associates,
who else have we picked up and what have

1950
01:20:04,010 --> 01:20:07,470
they said up to this point?
Do you have anything like that that you

1951
01:20:07,471 --> 01:20:10,920
can walk into there?
If you walk into an interrogation and

1952
01:20:10,921 --> 01:20:12,600
you haven't done your homework,
you're screwed,

1953
01:20:12,690 --> 01:20:14,280
right?
It's going to show out really quickly

1954
01:20:14,281 --> 01:20:16,290
and they're going to figure it out for
the most part.

1955
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:18,260
You know,
not to say that there every detainee

1956
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:20,400
would be a lex Luthor,
but you know,

1957
01:20:20,401 --> 01:20:23,700
they get a sense pretty quickly so you
really got to have it buttoned up,

1958
01:20:23,701 --> 01:20:27,930
have as much information as possible so
that you know how to direct the

1959
01:20:27,931 --> 01:20:31,010
conversation.
If anything is said at all,

1960
01:20:31,030 --> 01:20:33,660
volunteered at all,
is there any credibility to it?

1961
01:20:33,690 --> 01:20:35,730
What can you do with that information?
You can take it back and get it

1962
01:20:35,731 --> 01:20:38,150
corroborated by another series

1963
01:20:38,180 --> 01:20:41,230
is a.
it's going to shut that off man series.

1964
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:44,270
I'm transcribing everything you said.
No,

1965
01:20:45,150 --> 01:20:49,340
I ain't mad at doing that.
Well now what about,

1966
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:55,300
what about using like chemicals?
Like what about like Mtma have they ever

1967
01:20:56,331 --> 01:21:00,530
tried given detainees ecstasy?
I'm no,

1968
01:21:00,531 --> 01:21:01,720
I mean I dunno.
Sixties,

1969
01:21:01,721 --> 01:21:02,910
you know,
maybe the 19 sixties.

1970
01:21:02,940 --> 01:21:05,340
I'm sure I would say.
And you'd be.

1971
01:21:05,350 --> 01:21:08,060
You'd be surprised.
It's taking a series still listening to

1972
01:21:08,061 --> 01:21:10,040
me that,
that big brother she knew.

1973
01:21:10,041 --> 01:21:12,230
Well,
I don't know what to do this to the

1974
01:21:12,290 --> 01:21:13,123
government.
It's,

1975
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:15,680
it's google.
I hate to break it to Google,

1976
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:20,090
but you can listen right now on youtube
to fucking covertly attack people's

1977
01:21:20,091 --> 01:21:22,800
phones doing that asshole stuff.
No,

1978
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:23,350
it's.
You know what?

1979
01:21:23,350 --> 01:21:24,260
There's.
There are,

1980
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:26,600
and again,
they might not know enough about

1981
01:21:26,601 --> 01:21:29,120
ecstasy.
I need to get on the team if I just

1982
01:21:29,121 --> 01:21:29,954
talked to them.

1983
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:31,840
Get along.
I'm telling you,

1984
01:21:31,910 --> 01:21:34,240
you give these guys to hits.
They'll tell you everything because

1985
01:21:34,340 --> 01:21:36,280
getting massage,
that'll be your code name.

1986
01:21:36,330 --> 01:21:39,530
It'd be so nice to you.
It just changes everything.

1987
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,630
That's.
There'll be so nice to you.

1988
01:21:41,950 --> 01:21:46,070
They'll just give him like some
delicious food and give them a back rub

1989
01:21:46,071 --> 01:21:47,120
and just go,
listen man,

1990
01:21:47,121 --> 01:21:49,700
America's awesome.
Tell me what you know about that plot

1991
01:21:49,701 --> 01:21:52,100
that we want to know about.
Blow anybody up,

1992
01:21:52,101 --> 01:21:53,630
man.
They can't be your friend.

1993
01:21:53,690 --> 01:21:56,000
How could you do that?
If you kill people that can't be your

1994
01:21:56,001 --> 01:21:57,210
friend.
Yeah,

1995
01:21:57,950 --> 01:21:59,810
I think that would work.
I don't know why we didn't think about

1996
01:21:59,811 --> 01:22:01,460
that,
but it seems like it wouldn't work,

1997
01:22:01,461 --> 01:22:03,970
but you know why you haven't done that.
Well,

1998
01:22:03,971 --> 01:22:04,804
there you go.
You've done it.

1999
01:22:04,850 --> 01:22:06,480
No,
that you go,

2000
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:07,580
I've done it.
Trust me.

2001
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:11,360
It'll fucking work.
Getting people to heads of ecstasy.

2002
01:22:12,070 --> 01:22:12,741
Acid,
a show.

2003
01:22:12,741 --> 01:22:13,630
I tell you what I'll do.
We'll get.

2004
01:22:13,860 --> 01:22:18,260
I will get on the jet and we'll go back
to headquarters and meeting saying is

2005
01:22:18,261 --> 01:22:22,400
bullshit.
I'm joking around the what that stuff

2006
01:22:22,401 --> 01:22:26,010
does is first of all,
it kills all of your inhibitions are

2007
01:22:26,030 --> 01:22:28,910
gone.
All of your anxiety gone.

2008
01:22:28,940 --> 01:22:32,330
All in,
all of your insecurities gone and what

2009
01:22:32,331 --> 01:22:37,331
you're left with is this over Saratonin.
Over dopa means state.

2010
01:22:37,611 --> 01:22:39,680
We just love everything.
And everybody,

2011
01:22:39,980 --> 01:22:42,380
if you could give that to enemy
combatants,

2012
01:22:42,381 --> 01:22:45,020
I guarantee you if you could talk to
them,

2013
01:22:45,350 --> 01:22:48,020
you would get shit out of them that they
would never want to discuss.

2014
01:22:48,090 --> 01:22:49,190
Yeah,
I think the

2015
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:55,700
people will buy it when I say it,
but there are tremendous constraints on

2016
01:22:56,220 --> 01:22:58,530
what can and can't be done.
If people had gone through and actually

2017
01:22:58,531 --> 01:22:59,364
read all those dog

2018
01:22:59,430 --> 01:23:01,120
memos that were released,
me and buddy.

2019
01:23:01,121 --> 01:23:02,100
There you go.
That's what I'm talking about.

2020
01:23:02,101 --> 01:23:07,060
The chemist
coat on some fake glasses.

2021
01:23:07,061 --> 01:23:08,770
So I look,
look smarter than I am.

2022
01:23:10,070 --> 01:23:13,230
Give me a stethoscope,
maybe liking club Gary.

2023
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:15,520
Just show up.
You take them out for a rave.

2024
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:18,640
High water pants,
Italian shoes.

2025
01:23:19,030 --> 01:23:21,580
Now you're talking sort of the seventies
hustle.

2026
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:22,630
Yeah,
just bring me in.

2027
01:23:22,631 --> 01:23:23,890
I'm telling you.
Just let me try it.

2028
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:28,060
Once I could fix a lot of shit,
I'll put the idea forward.

2029
01:23:28,090 --> 01:23:31,180
I'll see what they say.
And then if you know the reason why they

2030
01:23:31,181 --> 01:23:33,380
don't think it would work because they
haven't done it yet.

2031
01:23:33,460 --> 01:23:37,150
If you get anybody in the viewer,
anybody in the ca or wherever who has

2032
01:23:37,151 --> 01:23:39,400
done ecstasy,
they would listen to this and they would

2033
01:23:39,401 --> 01:23:42,040
not want to say they've done it.
So it'd be a real issue.

2034
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:43,420
But if you.
I'm telling you,

2035
01:23:43,421 --> 01:23:47,260
you give people two tabs of ecstasy and
then start asking them questions.

2036
01:23:47,290 --> 01:23:49,240
Plus also it would've been much happier
facility.

2037
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:51,350
Oh yeah.
Can you open the next day?

2038
01:23:51,370 --> 01:23:53,260
Not the next day.
Next Day is rough.

2039
01:23:53,530 --> 01:23:55,340
He fucking.
I remember the first time,

2040
01:23:55,341 --> 01:23:58,090
well I only did it once,
but the next day I did it.

2041
01:23:58,091 --> 01:24:01,390
I quit.
I was in a coffee shop trying to read a

2042
01:24:01,391 --> 01:24:04,210
boxing magazine.
I literally could not read.

2043
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:05,561
I was like,
God,

2044
01:24:05,561 --> 01:24:08,260
I can't even concentrate enough to read
a full sentence.

2045
01:24:08,261 --> 01:24:12,250
Like this is terrible.
And it was just pretty much that day

2046
01:24:12,251 --> 01:24:13,030
after.
No,

2047
01:24:13,030 --> 01:24:15,880
it's good to a couple of days.
That night I went onstage and I was

2048
01:24:15,881 --> 01:24:18,910
terrible.
I went on stage that night in Dallas.

2049
01:24:18,911 --> 01:24:21,580
If you went to that show back in 2001 or
whatever it was.

2050
01:24:21,581 --> 01:24:23,040
I'm sorry.
If I was apologizing.

2051
01:24:23,390 --> 01:24:24,510
Terrible show.
Well,

2052
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:25,630
I just had no energy.

2053
01:24:25,690 --> 01:24:30,160
My brain was just like.
I felt like my brain was a dry sponge.

2054
01:24:30,161 --> 01:24:33,820
Like someone had just squeezed all the
juice out of my brain.

2055
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:35,550
Yeah.
See it says after effects,

2056
01:24:35,551 --> 01:24:36,100
I just,
you know,

2057
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:39,040
you're not worth it now,
but there's ways out of that.

2058
01:24:39,220 --> 01:24:40,840
There's a.
just keep on it.

2059
01:24:40,890 --> 01:24:42,550
No,
there's nutrients that you take called

2060
01:24:42,551 --> 01:24:45,700
five htp.
Five htp actually converts.

2061
01:24:45,701 --> 01:24:47,920
The serotonin in your brain is the
building blocks for it,

2062
01:24:47,921 --> 01:24:52,750
so what you do is while you're tripping,
you're supposed to double down on five

2063
01:24:52,751 --> 01:24:56,250
htp and it helps you as you come off of
it,

2064
01:24:56,260 --> 01:24:58,130
your serotonin jumps back up.
Oh,

2065
01:24:58,270 --> 01:25:01,810
not 100 percent though,
but to a manageable state,

2066
01:25:01,910 --> 01:25:03,460
who would.
You do have to be a chemist though to do

2067
01:25:03,461 --> 01:25:04,120
all that.
Right.

2068
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:06,490
Just got to be discovered just by a
couple of tabs at the club,

2069
01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:07,780
you know,
call it good,

2070
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:09,640
but if you're really smart,
you actually take l,

2071
01:25:09,670 --> 01:25:14,670
Tryptophan and five htp because El
Tryptophan converts to five htp and you

2072
01:25:15,131 --> 01:25:18,130
should also take adaptogens,
like some b vitamins and different

2073
01:25:18,131 --> 01:25:18,730
things as well.

2074
01:25:18,730 --> 01:25:19,620
That sense?
What?

2075
01:25:19,830 --> 01:25:20,770
Is that?
What's in Turkey?

2076
01:25:21,010 --> 01:25:21,843
Yes.
Okay.

2077
01:25:21,940 --> 01:25:24,520
Yeah,
but you just have a Turkey club,

2078
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:29,410
nice Turkey club.
While you're that apparently that's

2079
01:25:29,411 --> 01:25:33,340
bullshit that crashed that people we say
from Turkey that you know,

2080
01:25:33,370 --> 01:25:36,340
it puts you to sleep.
Apparently that's all just carbs.

2081
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:37,930
Oh yeah,
that makes sense.

2082
01:25:37,931 --> 01:25:40,390
Yeah.
And massive amounts of mashed potatoes,

2083
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:44,200
stuffing.
You just overeat and I can believe that.

2084
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:44,960
Yeah,
yeah,

2085
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:47,020
yeah.
Although I do love stuffing.

2086
01:25:47,290 --> 01:25:49,090
Listen,
bring this information back.

2087
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:50,590
I'm telling you,
you have to bring it back.

2088
01:25:50,591 --> 01:25:52,090
It's happening right now.
It's happening right now.

2089
01:25:52,091 --> 01:25:55,060
They're hearing us listening to the
watch center.

2090
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:57,400
They don't know.
It's only because they don't know

2091
01:25:57,470 --> 01:25:59,400
Langley there taking notes right now.
You know he.

2092
01:25:59,670 --> 01:26:01,450
I am right.
I'm telling you.

2093
01:26:01,451 --> 01:26:02,380
I'm right.
Just try it once.

2094
01:26:02,381 --> 01:26:03,780
It doesn't hurt anybody.
They're not going to die.

2095
01:26:03,790 --> 01:26:04,040
You might

2096
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:06,710
have to change some laws to to get that
to happen.

2097
01:26:06,711 --> 01:26:09,950
Last fucking nose ain't bring me in.
There's no laws.

2098
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:12,620
No.
I show up with a suitcase and a smile.

2099
01:26:13,580 --> 01:26:16,080
Get you guys some UFC tickets.
We'll buy it.

2100
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:17,540
We'll know.
We'll get you a lab coat.

2101
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:24,020
Get Joe's special disguise.
Just let me try it once.

2102
01:26:24,021 --> 01:26:28,670
I guarantee just someone that some.
Someone who's not totally despicable,

2103
01:26:28,671 --> 01:26:31,880
like you just gotta like a little issue
with this guy talking.

2104
01:26:32,390 --> 01:26:34,620
It just changes your chemistry
immediate.

2105
01:26:34,621 --> 01:26:37,370
Just whittle.
It will erase any inhibitions.

2106
01:26:37,371 --> 01:26:39,950
You.
That sounds all very mengele like does,

2107
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:41,720
but it doesn't hurt anybody.
That's the thing.

2108
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:43,250
Yeah.
Yeah.

2109
01:26:43,251 --> 01:26:47,420
I think right now people are losing
their minds because we got back on the.

2110
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:50,600
The interrogation thing,
everybody thinks I thought that was over

2111
01:26:50,601 --> 01:26:51,360
and done with.
Oh,

2112
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:53,490
you on your side in the business.
Yeah,

2113
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:54,560
just people in general.

2114
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:56,840
I think everybody's just.
People just got so tired of it.

2115
01:26:58,160 --> 01:27:00,050
Tired of the war on terror.
Nobody wants to talk.

2116
01:27:00,070 --> 01:27:01,400
Oh,
not that I want to talk about it,

2117
01:27:01,401 --> 01:27:05,870
but that's what happens.
You think where's the end where you

2118
01:27:05,871 --> 01:27:06,321
know,
and,

2119
01:27:06,321 --> 01:27:08,900
and people just tired of it.
I just want to move on.

2120
01:27:08,901 --> 01:27:13,160
I don't want to think about it and
something happens and people are

2121
01:27:13,161 --> 01:27:15,980
reminded that it's still going on.
There's still people out there that want

2122
01:27:15,981 --> 01:27:18,800
to hurt you and yet we're all just so
exhausted from it.

2123
01:27:19,070 --> 01:27:20,360
Well,
I think that's also.

2124
01:27:20,420 --> 01:27:21,020
I mean,
you could,

2125
01:27:21,020 --> 01:27:25,450
you could make an analogy to some of the
stupid lies that trump has told that

2126
01:27:25,470 --> 01:27:28,670
tell so many lies that he just like,
I can't even be bothered.

2127
01:27:28,671 --> 01:27:30,680
This can't even be a scandal because
there's just,

2128
01:27:30,681 --> 01:27:33,530
there's so many of them.
You just get overwhelmed by it to the

2129
01:27:33,531 --> 01:27:34,460
point where you can't even.

2130
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:36,710
He can't process it anymore.
It's exhausting.

2131
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:37,633
It's exhausting.
And,

2132
01:27:37,660 --> 01:27:40,340
and the,
the idea that it kind of works both

2133
01:27:40,341 --> 01:27:40,851
ways,
right?

2134
01:27:40,851 --> 01:27:44,900
It works in the sense that the tweets
and the bizarre statements and the

2135
01:27:44,901 --> 01:27:46,790
things are exhausting.
And then on the,

2136
01:27:46,791 --> 01:27:48,980
you know,
the other side that people that want to

2137
01:27:48,981 --> 01:27:52,100
make all of that stuff,
the death of the republic every day,

2138
01:27:52,101 --> 01:27:54,380
it's the death of the republic that's
exhausting.

2139
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:57,860
And you say who's,
who's running the shop,

2140
01:27:57,861 --> 01:28:00,650
who's keeping things moving forward?
And I don't know,

2141
01:28:01,370 --> 01:28:01,851
you know,
I mean,

2142
01:28:01,851 --> 01:28:03,260
we've got some good people in
governments,

2143
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:06,380
really hardworking people for sure.
Trying to do the right thing.

2144
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:10,430
And yet it's just a,
I'm not,

2145
01:28:10,431 --> 01:28:12,080
I'm not particularly confident right
now.

2146
01:28:12,860 --> 01:28:14,990
What do you think's the worst case
scenario right now?

2147
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:18,520
So when you say you're not confident.
Um,

2148
01:28:18,590 --> 01:28:21,800
well I think we could have,
we could see the market,

2149
01:28:21,860 --> 01:28:23,960
you know,
kind of stall at this point.

2150
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:25,550
I mean,
I think people have been amazed at how

2151
01:28:25,551 --> 01:28:28,340
the market was resilient and not just
resilient,

2152
01:28:28,341 --> 01:28:31,790
but you know,
a blasting upwards and showing

2153
01:28:31,791 --> 01:28:34,000
apparently no concern for,
you know,

2154
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:37,460
how disheveled the administration has
been over the last several months has

2155
01:28:37,461 --> 01:28:40,760
been on a steady increase since 2007 or
so.

2156
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:42,430
No,
the crash,

2157
01:28:42,431 --> 01:28:43,190
right?
Yeah.

2158
01:28:43,190 --> 01:28:46,070
But since that,
since the recovery of the long time,

2159
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:47,750
it took a long time to come back,
but then.

2160
01:28:47,751 --> 01:28:48,201
Yeah.
Right.

2161
01:28:48,201 --> 01:28:49,034
I mean it's not,
it's not,

2162
01:28:49,220 --> 01:28:51,470
but what I'm talking about is the time
since the election,

2163
01:28:51,770 --> 01:28:53,690
you know,
the market's showed this ability to kind

2164
01:28:53,691 --> 01:28:56,050
of ignore what was happening.
Right.

2165
01:28:56,060 --> 01:29:01,060
What was sort of the chaos that the
media is reporting on and encouraged

2166
01:29:02,551 --> 01:29:06,240
though by his remarks about business.
You want to encourage tax cuts.

2167
01:29:06,270 --> 01:29:07,170
Yeah,
absolutely.

2168
01:29:07,171 --> 01:29:07,821
Yeah.
And the,

2169
01:29:07,821 --> 01:29:09,980
and some of the deregulation which has,
you know,

2170
01:29:10,050 --> 01:29:10,801
okay,
to be fair,

2171
01:29:10,801 --> 01:29:13,320
you know,
it's been a lot a fair amount of

2172
01:29:13,321 --> 01:29:14,154
deregulation.

2173
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:17,250
Tax cuts not so much.
And so I think now that,

2174
01:29:17,251 --> 01:29:18,960
you know,
the market's starting to look at that

2175
01:29:18,961 --> 01:29:21,170
and think maybe we do have an issue
here.

2176
01:29:21,220 --> 01:29:22,370
Maybe it's not,
you know,

2177
01:29:22,410 --> 01:29:23,670
oh,
I'm going to work out the way we

2178
01:29:23,671 --> 01:29:25,710
thought,
so maybe that slows down.

2179
01:29:25,711 --> 01:29:28,140
I don't think North Korea is going to be
watching any missiles.

2180
01:29:28,141 --> 01:29:29,910
They're not suicidal,
right?

2181
01:29:29,911 --> 01:29:32,580
I mean,
they're not going to see.

2182
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:36,470
And Kim Jong Gun.
What's the fuck's his name?

2183
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:38,520
The basketball player with those shit
and his lips.

2184
01:29:38,550 --> 01:29:42,840
Rodman Rodman said Rodman over there
with a little Kim Yong.

2185
01:29:42,890 --> 01:29:45,530
And that's what I'm sad I can do.
That.

2186
01:29:45,540 --> 01:29:48,390
Definitely does ecstasy.
So that's that.

2187
01:29:48,391 --> 01:29:50,790
Now that I could get behind,
that's an operation we could,

2188
01:29:50,820 --> 01:29:55,260
we could work on know because that's not
targeting detainees and then have all

2189
01:29:55,270 --> 01:29:56,580
those regulations we've got to worry
about.

2190
01:29:56,581 --> 01:29:57,840
But I think,
you know,

2191
01:29:58,500 --> 01:29:59,630
if Rodman,
you know,

2192
01:29:59,730 --> 01:30:02,850
willingly offers up ecstasy and Kim
says,

2193
01:30:02,851 --> 01:30:05,520
fine,
then it's two consenting adults yet we

2194
01:30:05,521 --> 01:30:07,440
don't even allow Rodman to go back over
there anymore.

2195
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:08,320
Right.
Was.

2196
01:30:08,321 --> 01:30:09,750
Yeah.
I think that Americans aren't allowed to

2197
01:30:09,751 --> 01:30:10,800
go back there and now,
but now,

2198
01:30:10,801 --> 01:30:12,600
right now I suspect,
although if Robin wanted to,

2199
01:30:12,601 --> 01:30:14,050
I'm sure he.
Yeah.

2200
01:30:14,110 --> 01:30:17,790
Yeah.
That's our answer to everything sent

2201
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:20,280
Dennis.
He was a hell of a ballplayer in his

2202
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:21,240
day.
People Forget.

2203
01:30:21,241 --> 01:30:23,140
People think Pacino.
He's such an interesting cat,

2204
01:30:23,670 --> 01:30:25,980
but people forget what a great
basketball player he was.

2205
01:30:26,190 --> 01:30:27,900
Yeah.
He just sort of went crazy.

2206
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:28,800
Yeah.
Yeah.

2207
01:30:28,830 --> 01:30:31,350
Look at them.
Remember this picture?

2208
01:30:31,590 --> 01:30:34,650
Oh yeah.
Bad as I want to be.

2209
01:30:34,651 --> 01:30:37,470
Was that a bookie or something?
Well,

2210
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:40,140
I mean you can't knock the guy for
trying to be unique.

2211
01:30:40,141 --> 01:30:40,830
Yeah,
no,

2212
01:30:40,830 --> 01:30:41,880
he's,
he's unique.

2213
01:30:41,881 --> 01:30:43,080
But he was again,
he,

2214
01:30:43,310 --> 01:30:44,560
he was a hell of a player.
Oh,

2215
01:30:44,561 --> 01:30:47,460
he definitely was mad.
A good look.

2216
01:30:47,461 --> 01:30:51,120
I haven't seen it one for.
I got a jacket just like tropical jacket

2217
01:30:51,121 --> 01:30:55,020
with all the palm trees and what he said
he's wearing around his neck.

2218
01:30:55,020 --> 01:30:57,720
His had a fishing net or is that.
It could be anything

2219
01:31:01,260 --> 01:31:04,620
mad.
It's like a silver Mr t thing.

2220
01:31:04,740 --> 01:31:06,090
See,
I could look at that and say I could

2221
01:31:06,091 --> 01:31:07,650
never pull that off.
I could never.

2222
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:09,900
I couldn't do that for Christmas.
Yeah.

2223
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:11,190
Halloween,
but not.

2224
01:31:11,220 --> 01:31:14,390
Not for Christmas.
Had Christmas and and besides it

2225
01:31:14,490 --> 01:31:16,580
Christmas when the season arrives,
I put on my,

2226
01:31:16,610 --> 01:31:21,510
my handmade New York giants,
a sweater from my daughter and I don't

2227
01:31:21,511 --> 01:31:24,140
take it off until after the Christmas
season as well.

2228
01:31:24,210 --> 01:31:24,991
Yeah.
Yeah.

2229
01:31:24,991 --> 01:31:26,630
It's pretty manky by now.
But yeah,

2230
01:31:27,030 --> 01:31:29,840
that's a great way to do that because
it's a giant.

2231
01:31:30,130 --> 01:31:31,130
Oh,
oh,

2232
01:31:31,170 --> 01:31:35,300
sort of giants.
One of those guys just cling to it to

2233
01:31:35,350 --> 01:31:38,430
cling to the past.
Glories maybe

2234
01:31:41,970 --> 01:31:43,890
not in the government anymore.
So.

2235
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:45,090
No,
no.

2236
01:31:45,150 --> 01:31:48,560
I might those days or even the
possibility of those days just.

2237
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:50,820
I mean,
unless maybe I get older and I just,

2238
01:31:51,430 --> 01:31:53,820
you know,
I want to see kids just slipped out of

2239
01:31:53,821 --> 01:31:54,740
tab,
you know,

2240
01:31:54,750 --> 01:31:57,210
and see what happens.
I told her to calm the fuck down.

2241
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:58,380
Yes.
Yeah.

2242
01:31:58,530 --> 01:31:59,970
There's only one way.
Not told

2243
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:00,551
my kids.
Okay.

2244
01:32:00,551 --> 01:32:01,660
If,
if things get bad,

2245
01:32:01,661 --> 01:32:02,770
if I start to,
you know,

2246
01:32:02,771 --> 01:32:06,190
I got blessed my,
my mom's 98 and she's all there.

2247
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:08,110
She's great.
My Dad passed away when he was 90.

2248
01:32:08,111 --> 01:32:11,620
He was all there and uh,
and so I've got a knock on wood.

2249
01:32:11,621 --> 01:32:13,660
I'm hoping to make it a good long ways,
but

2250
01:32:15,930 --> 01:32:18,820
I've also seen folks deal with the
problem of,

2251
01:32:18,850 --> 01:32:21,430
you know,
onset dementia and Alzheimer's,

2252
01:32:21,431 --> 01:32:23,770
the problems that,
that creates horrible things.

2253
01:32:24,470 --> 01:32:28,010
I told my kids that I haven't told them,
but I told the oldest one is just we'll

2254
01:32:28,020 --> 01:32:30,710
that out to the back and you know,
you guys all take turns shooting abby

2255
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:34,210
and whoever,
whoever wins gets the house.

2256
01:32:34,900 --> 01:32:37,660
So is that really what you told them?
What?

2257
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:38,553
Yeah,
the oldest one.

2258
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:39,430
I said,
shoot you.

2259
01:32:39,910 --> 01:32:41,020
He'll,
he'll win my ways.

2260
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:42,070
It's pretty good shot.
Yeah.

2261
01:32:42,071 --> 01:32:43,360
But if then he'll go to jail.

2262
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:45,550
You don't want that title.
Ho sure.

2263
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,860
There's some law on the books that says
it's okay to,

2264
01:32:48,260 --> 01:32:49,190
you know.
No,

2265
01:32:49,410 --> 01:32:50,890
that's not true.
You're right.

2266
01:32:51,010 --> 01:32:54,130
Where do they have that?
Assisted suicide is in California,

2267
01:32:54,131 --> 01:32:55,780
California,
and I think Oregon.

2268
01:32:55,830 --> 01:32:59,590
You posted something about Idaho,
about people that were going up there

2269
01:32:59,591 --> 01:33:03,100
for the eclipse and I retweeted it.
It was fucking hilarious from the

2270
01:33:03,190 --> 01:33:06,820
sheriff's department,
Lincoln County sheriffs that that guy

2271
01:33:06,850 --> 01:33:09,970
knocked it out of the park because
everybody was thinking the same thing.

2272
01:33:09,971 --> 01:33:14,070
Everybody was like it because literally
the hippies,

2273
01:33:14,260 --> 01:33:15,250
I don't know,
maybe they're not hippie,

2274
01:33:15,251 --> 01:33:16,031
so I.
that's not fair,

2275
01:33:16,031 --> 01:33:18,020
but let's call them hippies.
Yeah.

2276
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:19,210
They just,
they'd pull their,

2277
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:21,190
their camper or their,
you know,

2278
01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:22,900
their,
their Volkswagen van again,

2279
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:25,840
right out in the middle of a plant.
That field of freshly planted field

2280
01:33:26,290 --> 01:33:27,130
because it's not,
not,

2281
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:29,230
not everything is fenced and gate it out
there.

2282
01:33:29,230 --> 01:33:31,420
Right.
There's a lot of space and you're like,

2283
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:32,900
come on.
Or they'll,

2284
01:33:32,901 --> 01:33:33,650
they'll,
they'll take.

2285
01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:35,620
Like I said,
they'll take their prius up in the back

2286
01:33:35,621 --> 01:33:36,680
roads,
you know,

2287
01:33:38,130 --> 01:33:40,860
it's not going to make it.
The funny thing was about the dogs to

2288
01:33:41,350 --> 01:33:44,560
dogs riding the back of the truck and
occasionally some slow loaners took a

2289
01:33:44,561 --> 01:33:46,690
tumble,
but don't go to pet them.

2290
01:33:46,691 --> 01:33:48,910
They will bite you.
It's your truck.

2291
01:33:48,911 --> 01:33:51,100
It's their truck.
And you'll see that you'll see people,

2292
01:33:51,130 --> 01:33:52,270
hey,
they get upset because,

2293
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:53,350
you know,
drive around with your,

2294
01:33:53,380 --> 01:33:53,960
you know,
your,

2295
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:56,410
your dog in the back of the truck.
And B,

2296
01:33:56,411 --> 01:33:58,750
they'll,
they'll like walk up and why don't I

2297
01:33:59,140 --> 01:34:01,060
write pettit new thing?
Don't do that.

2298
01:34:01,061 --> 01:34:04,120
Don't do it.
You don't even know if he's a good dog,

2299
01:34:04,121 --> 01:34:05,500
but he,
that's his truck.

2300
01:34:05,650 --> 01:34:07,330
The other thing about people haven't
guns.

2301
01:34:07,350 --> 01:34:09,550
It's yes.
Everybody up here has a gun.

2302
01:34:09,670 --> 01:34:13,870
This is Idaho and the wildlife,
the wildlife will kill you.

2303
01:34:14,380 --> 01:34:16,570
I'll kill you.
And it will hurt the whole time you're

2304
01:34:16,571 --> 01:34:18,340
dying.
Yeah.

2305
01:34:18,390 --> 01:34:20,320
That sheriff,
it was great post.

2306
01:34:21,670 --> 01:34:23,950
We got great law enforcement or not.
I just got stopped.

2307
01:34:23,951 --> 01:34:27,160
I was uh,
we were up in the mountains and I was

2308
01:34:27,161 --> 01:34:30,040
racing to get to the airport on Sunday
yesterday.

2309
01:34:30,130 --> 01:34:33,500
And so I was coming through the canyon,
um,

2310
01:34:33,890 --> 01:34:38,890
and hidden back into boise from up in
the mountains and it's doing well.

2311
01:34:39,220 --> 01:34:41,410
I know what I was doing because the
sheriff told me what I was doing.

2312
01:34:41,411 --> 01:34:44,670
He stopped me.
He said even [inaudible] 76 and this is

2313
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:47,200
a,
this is a nasty ass canyon following the

2314
01:34:47,201 --> 01:34:48,034
river,
you know,

2315
01:34:48,510 --> 01:34:52,090
for most of the way and you know,
you should be doing about 35,

2316
01:34:52,091 --> 01:34:54,490
40,
but I always just helmet,

2317
01:34:54,540 --> 01:34:56,410
you know.
And I was thinking I'm making good time

2318
01:34:56,411 --> 01:34:56,650
here.

2319
01:34:56,650 --> 01:35:01,100
And the sheriff was out because he's
trying to catch hippies and he stopped

2320
01:35:01,130 --> 01:35:02,780
me and we had it,
but they're just great.

2321
01:35:02,781 --> 01:35:03,380
You know,
that you,

2322
01:35:03,380 --> 01:35:06,290
if you show them respect and implied,
it's like a lot of places,

2323
01:35:06,291 --> 01:35:07,240
right?
It's not just idle,

2324
01:35:07,550 --> 01:35:09,380
but the guy was like,
you know what,

2325
01:35:09,530 --> 01:35:11,900
I'm sorry what to gave you to,
you know.

2326
01:35:11,901 --> 01:35:13,380
But yeah.
How's everything else?

2327
01:35:13,381 --> 01:35:14,870
And you end up chatting,
having a great time,

2328
01:35:14,871 --> 01:35:17,210
having a conversation.
You don't mind getting the ticket and

2329
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:19,460
you know,
bob's your uncle.

2330
01:35:19,490 --> 01:35:21,800
But anyway,
we just white privilege of showing.

2331
01:35:21,860 --> 01:35:23,670
Yeah.
That's what's happening right there.

2332
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:25,610
Is that what's happening to a bunch of
white privilege.

2333
01:35:25,620 --> 01:35:26,660
Right.
Tammy?

2334
01:35:26,770 --> 01:35:27,610
That,
you know what,

2335
01:35:27,620 --> 01:35:29,870
that's probably,
that's probably the case now.

2336
01:35:29,871 --> 01:35:31,310
I feel bad and I'm,
you know what I'm gonna do?

2337
01:35:31,311 --> 01:35:33,230
I'm going to,
I'm going to double what I sent in to

2338
01:35:33,231 --> 01:35:35,690
the county.
I'm going to pay twice the amount that I

2339
01:35:35,691 --> 01:35:36,740
should.
Well that's nice.

2340
01:35:36,741 --> 01:35:38,050
Just so that I,
I,

2341
01:35:38,150 --> 01:35:41,790
I self flagellate.
Yeah.

2342
01:35:41,990 --> 01:35:44,240
It's not like it's a hobby.
Most cops are great.

2343
01:35:44,300 --> 01:35:45,140
I've always said that.

2344
01:35:45,180 --> 01:35:48,210
I think that cops will look,
most people,

2345
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:51,360
most people you run into her fine,
most people you run into a great,

2346
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:54,960
occasionally you run into an asshole and
then you have a problem and then you run

2347
01:35:54,961 --> 01:35:56,730
around going all people.
We're all assholes.

2348
01:35:56,860 --> 01:35:59,010
No,
maybe one out of 100,

2349
01:35:59,340 --> 01:36:02,940
you know.
And I think with cops it's an insanely

2350
01:36:02,941 --> 01:36:04,910
difficult job.
Insanely stressful.

2351
01:36:04,980 --> 01:36:08,520
And you see that video,
that one officer who was trying to get

2352
01:36:08,521 --> 01:36:11,900
that fellow to stop and he was wearing,
he was wearing a body camera and so he

2353
01:36:11,901 --> 01:36:15,000
had,
he had asked him to stop and he matched

2354
01:36:15,001 --> 01:36:18,560
the description of a,
I think of robbery and um,

2355
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:20,820
it's been on,
it's been on video of quite a bit.

2356
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:23,910
And so the,
the officer is trying to get him to stop

2357
01:36:24,210 --> 01:36:25,590
trying to him to stop.
He won't stop.

2358
01:36:25,591 --> 01:36:28,230
He says I will tase you.
And he's coming around.

2359
01:36:28,231 --> 01:36:28,920
Right?
So He's,

2360
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:30,570
the guy won't be take his hand out of
his pocket.

2361
01:36:30,571 --> 01:36:33,120
And that's what the officer sees that
his hands in his pocket when he gets

2362
01:36:33,170 --> 01:36:34,600
kind of starts,
you know,

2363
01:36:35,100 --> 01:36:40,100
pie in that chart.
There are any kind of gets around and he

2364
01:36:40,410 --> 01:36:42,480
sees the hand and he starts saying,
take your hand out,

2365
01:36:42,481 --> 01:36:44,400
take your hand and take in its body
cameras running,

2366
01:36:44,790 --> 01:36:49,260
and the guy pulls out a weapon and shoot
him repeatedly and it's just,

2367
01:36:49,261 --> 01:36:50,760
it's all there on kids.
It's,

2368
01:36:50,820 --> 01:36:54,600
it's a,
it's a perfect example of how difficult

2369
01:36:54,601 --> 01:36:55,900
that job can be.
Right.

2370
01:36:55,901 --> 01:36:57,060
And it's,
it's astounding.

2371
01:36:57,210 --> 01:36:58,710
So I know whether that video is
available.

2372
01:36:58,850 --> 01:36:59,720
Yeah,
it is available.

2373
01:36:59,721 --> 01:37:00,471
I've seen it.
Yeah,

2374
01:37:00,471 --> 01:37:01,640
there's,
there's a bunch of those.

2375
01:37:01,641 --> 01:37:04,070
I mean,
I've seen one of them where a guy pulls

2376
01:37:04,071 --> 01:37:08,450
over this one man and uh,
the guy was a Vietnam vet,

2377
01:37:08,460 --> 01:37:10,050
gets out of his car,
he's got a rifle,

2378
01:37:10,051 --> 01:37:11,510
was yelling at him,
get back to the car,

2379
01:37:11,511 --> 01:37:13,160
put the rifle down,
put the gun down,

2380
01:37:13,161 --> 01:37:17,150
and the guy starts shooting them and
he's shooting multiple rounds into the

2381
01:37:17,151 --> 01:37:18,560
guy's car.
And the guy started screaming.

2382
01:37:18,561 --> 01:37:20,780
Then he goes around by the passenger's
side and kills them.

2383
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:24,380
It's all like on camera and video,
you have to realize this is a routine

2384
01:37:24,381 --> 01:37:26,540
traffic stop,
pulls them over for speeding or whatever

2385
01:37:26,541 --> 01:37:28,190
it was.
And this happens.

2386
01:37:28,191 --> 01:37:31,640
And it can happen all the time and
that's something that's on a cop's mind

2387
01:37:31,670 --> 01:37:34,010
every time he pulls somebody over and
you might think,

2388
01:37:34,011 --> 01:37:35,330
hey,
I'm a good person,

2389
01:37:35,331 --> 01:37:37,670
I'm not doing anything.
So I was going five miles an hour over

2390
01:37:37,671 --> 01:37:38,840
the speed limit,
you know,

2391
01:37:38,841 --> 01:37:41,360
why is this guy got his hand on his gun?
Why this guy freaking out?

2392
01:37:41,390 --> 01:37:44,510
Well maybe watch that video now.
Maybe he's thinking about his kids,

2393
01:37:44,660 --> 01:37:46,340
maybe he's thinking about getting home
to his family.

2394
01:37:46,341 --> 01:37:46,580
Right,

2395
01:37:46,580 --> 01:37:47,413
exactly.
And that's.

2396
01:37:47,570 --> 01:37:49,010
And there's nothing to.
And again,

2397
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:54,160
this idea that you can't say two things
that some people might think,

2398
01:37:54,231 --> 01:37:54,521
oh,
that,

2399
01:37:54,521 --> 01:37:56,150
that counteracts.
Yeah,

2400
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:57,330
anytime there's a,
you know,

2401
01:37:57,331 --> 01:37:59,130
a case of police brutality,
deal with it,

2402
01:37:59,131 --> 01:38:02,610
we got to deal with hard course,
but it's a terrible job.

2403
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:04,980
It's a difficult job and it's a
dangerous job.

2404
01:38:04,981 --> 01:38:08,640
And those,
those two statements can coexist.

2405
01:38:08,810 --> 01:38:11,130
Right?
And there's so you can support the

2406
01:38:11,131 --> 01:38:15,330
police and you can also support efforts
to stop police brutality wherever it

2407
01:38:15,331 --> 01:38:20,331
takes place and ensure that it doesn't.
But you can also support the police and

2408
01:38:20,791 --> 01:38:23,340
the difficult job they do and the
efforts that they try to make them,

2409
01:38:23,420 --> 01:38:24,670
you know,
protect communities.

2410
01:38:24,671 --> 01:38:25,270
So

2411
01:38:25,270 --> 01:38:26,440
yeah,
the last thing you want to do is

2412
01:38:26,441 --> 01:38:29,200
alienate them further.
Mean that doesn't do anybody any good.

2413
01:38:29,210 --> 01:38:32,560
You denine the idea or the possibility
there are any good cops.

2414
01:38:32,561 --> 01:38:35,740
Well that's fucking crazy,
but it's a really convenient thing for

2415
01:38:35,741 --> 01:38:39,040
people to say fuck the police because
you don't get a lot of pushback.

2416
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:41,960
Especially when something happens.
You don't get a lot of pushback.

2417
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:42,790
You look like,
you know,

2418
01:38:42,790 --> 01:38:47,740
you're some sort of a liberal hero.
It's a very slippery slope.

2419
01:38:47,741 --> 01:38:49,980
And the people that want no cops.
Well,

2420
01:38:49,981 --> 01:38:51,670
okay,
well what about guns?

2421
01:38:51,700 --> 01:38:53,830
What are we going to do now?
You're going to just let criminals run

2422
01:38:53,831 --> 01:38:54,664
everything.
Yeah,

2423
01:38:54,790 --> 01:38:55,391
no,
no.

2424
01:38:55,391 --> 01:38:57,460
The good people with their flowers are
going to take over

2425
01:38:57,870 --> 01:38:59,430
shit.
Shit breaks down really quickly,

2426
01:38:59,460 --> 01:39:02,820
real quick and you know,
spend a long time overseas and some

2427
01:39:02,821 --> 01:39:07,821
pretty difficult environments and you
see sort of the worst nature of people

2428
01:39:08,460 --> 01:39:09,590
or you know,
and,

2429
01:39:09,591 --> 01:39:11,250
and you know,
and again,

2430
01:39:11,251 --> 01:39:13,060
I agree with it.
I think vast majority of people are

2431
01:39:13,210 --> 01:39:13,801
good,
you know,

2432
01:39:13,801 --> 01:39:15,780
they want to do good.
They want to do the right thing,

2433
01:39:16,230 --> 01:39:18,780
don't want conflict.
Most people don't want conflict,

2434
01:39:18,810 --> 01:39:19,500
right?
And,

2435
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:20,130
and,
but,

2436
01:39:20,130 --> 01:39:25,130
but things can break down and people can
do things that other folks that are

2437
01:39:25,231 --> 01:39:27,360
trying to do the right thing couldn't
even imagine.

2438
01:39:27,780 --> 01:39:29,100
And uh,
yeah.

2439
01:39:29,101 --> 01:39:29,600
So anyway,

2440
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:30,890
like shoot cops.
Yeah.

2441
01:39:31,120 --> 01:39:32,870
Yeah.
I mean you have to think I would never

2442
01:39:32,871 --> 01:39:35,990
shoot a cop wise's copy and so mean to
me because he doesn't fucking know you.

2443
01:39:36,020 --> 01:39:36,830
Right,
right.

2444
01:39:36,830 --> 01:39:38,210
You know,
it doesn't know you.

2445
01:39:38,211 --> 01:39:40,920
You're doing something wrong,
he's pulling you over and you've got to

2446
01:39:40,921 --> 01:39:45,470
comply and be polite and calm sir.
And try to diffuse the situation and be

2447
01:39:45,471 --> 01:39:47,540
as friendly and as polite as possible.
Yeah.

2448
01:39:47,770 --> 01:39:48,760
And that's not.
And again,

2449
01:39:48,761 --> 01:39:49,920
that's,
that's the same.

2450
01:39:50,260 --> 01:39:52,960
You can give your kid,
no matter who you are,

2451
01:39:53,020 --> 01:39:55,420
you can give your kid that same advice.
Look,

2452
01:39:55,750 --> 01:39:59,520
the law enforcement has a difficult job
and you know,

2453
01:40:00,190 --> 01:40:02,650
so just,
if you're stopped,

2454
01:40:02,890 --> 01:40:04,990
just comply,
comply.

2455
01:40:05,180 --> 01:40:06,590
Nobody's ever.
I mean,

2456
01:40:06,700 --> 01:40:10,180
I,
you just gotta you gotta be concise and

2457
01:40:10,181 --> 01:40:13,240
smart about that.
And I tell my kids out and I try to

2458
01:40:13,241 --> 01:40:17,560
demonstrate by like when I stopped you
and the sheriff came up and you know,

2459
01:40:17,561 --> 01:40:18,910
my kids were in the car and I,
I,

2460
01:40:19,090 --> 01:40:22,630
I was polite and I was saying,
and he got to the window and I said,

2461
01:40:22,631 --> 01:40:25,060
I don't have any excuse.
I was racing to get to the airport.

2462
01:40:25,061 --> 01:40:27,430
I was speeding.
I know it and I have no excuse.

2463
01:40:27,790 --> 01:40:31,390
And that sets the tone immediately.
And he understands right now it helps

2464
01:40:31,391 --> 01:40:32,920
it.
He looks in there and he sees a big dog

2465
01:40:32,921 --> 01:40:36,430
and the kids and everything and that
brings it down a little bit.

2466
01:40:36,460 --> 01:40:38,000
There's no doubt about it.
Um,

2467
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:41,530
and so other situations they might be
more on edge because they don't know.

2468
01:40:41,590 --> 01:40:43,990
They're not sure.
And you know,

2469
01:40:43,991 --> 01:40:45,610
so yes.
Where there's problems,

2470
01:40:45,611 --> 01:40:46,900
deal with it.
We got to take care of it,

2471
01:40:47,240 --> 01:40:50,590
but we can also acknowledge the fact
that the police have a damn difficult

2472
01:40:50,591 --> 01:40:51,424
job.
Yeah,

2473
01:40:51,490 --> 01:40:54,160
and it doesn't mean that there horrible
mistakes

2474
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:57,490
and horrible cops and people that are
under pressure to do terrible things.

2475
01:40:57,710 --> 01:40:59,260
You know,
mean there's some videos of people that

2476
01:40:59,261 --> 01:41:00,970
compliance still get shot.
It's,

2477
01:41:01,030 --> 01:41:02,710
yeah.
It's a terrible tragedy.

2478
01:41:02,770 --> 01:41:03,461
No,
absolutely.

2479
01:41:03,461 --> 01:41:05,470
They make mistakes.
They make mistakes or they had the wrong

2480
01:41:05,471 --> 01:41:10,390
mindset or they're not trained properly
and so their ptsd out and they're just

2481
01:41:10,391 --> 01:41:12,550
not designed for that job in the first
place.

2482
01:41:12,590 --> 01:41:13,390
Right.
I mean,

2483
01:41:13,390 --> 01:41:15,940
it's very difficult to tell who's going
to crack under pressure.

2484
01:41:15,970 --> 01:41:19,660
The pressure of the day to day situation
that a lot of cops find themselves in.

2485
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:20,670
Yeah.
No,

2486
01:41:20,670 --> 01:41:21,503
it's,
it's,

2487
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:23,830
um,
but the idea that you're right,

2488
01:41:23,831 --> 01:41:26,850
the idea that you'd remove law
enforcement and somehow we're all going

2489
01:41:26,851 --> 01:41:30,610
to live in a peaceful community.
Crazy anarchists driving me fucking

2490
01:41:30,611 --> 01:41:31,230
nuts.
Yeah.

2491
01:41:31,230 --> 01:41:32,320
We don't need laws,
man.

2492
01:41:32,620 --> 01:41:37,620
Shut your fucking mouth and get rid of
all the laws and universal basic income.

2493
01:41:37,780 --> 01:41:41,170
That's going to be a,
what did we do out the guns?

2494
01:41:41,171 --> 01:41:43,240
We've gathered them up and melt them
down,

2495
01:41:43,780 --> 01:41:46,240
not mine,
Make Martin Luther King Jr statues

2496
01:41:46,241 --> 01:41:50,440
everywhere.
And we know we were talking before the

2497
01:41:50,441 --> 01:41:52,660
podcast started about,
um,

2498
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:53,800
what's,
uh,

2499
01:41:53,830 --> 01:41:58,170
what could possibly go wrong in
Afghanistan and that trump was

2500
01:41:59,860 --> 01:42:02,920
trump was going to make some sort of an
announcement and you were talking about

2501
01:42:02,980 --> 01:42:06,190
the idea of privatizing the,
uh,

2502
01:42:06,191 --> 01:42:07,620
the military over there and,
you know,

2503
01:42:07,660 --> 01:42:11,230
bringing in contractors,
talking about it from the point of view

2504
01:42:11,231 --> 01:42:12,310
that I don't agree with it.
I.

2505
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:13,640
Yeah.
Um,

2506
01:42:13,890 --> 01:42:14,431
and I,
you know,

2507
01:42:14,431 --> 01:42:15,370
I,
you know,

2508
01:42:15,371 --> 01:42:17,170
in terms of disclosure,
right,

2509
01:42:17,171 --> 01:42:18,250
I mean,
my company intelligence,

2510
01:42:18,251 --> 01:42:20,080
we've got a security services group,
um,

2511
01:42:20,530 --> 01:42:24,370
and starting back in 2003,
we started building up a fairly

2512
01:42:24,371 --> 01:42:26,460
significant presence out in Iraq,
right as,

2513
01:42:26,461 --> 01:42:31,461
as private contractors providing support
to the infrastructure operations that

2514
01:42:31,721 --> 01:42:32,500
were going on out there.

2515
01:42:32,500 --> 01:42:36,490
And what's the benefit of having a
private contractor for the military as

2516
01:42:36,491 --> 01:42:38,470
opposed to like military force at that
time.

2517
01:42:38,471 --> 01:42:41,560
Most of our work was actually for the
infrastructure companies,

2518
01:42:41,590 --> 01:42:43,780
right?
Because the military is not providing

2519
01:42:43,830 --> 01:42:46,960
the support and they need the same level
of security and they have the burden is

2520
01:42:46,961 --> 01:42:48,820
building up some sort of a new business
there.

2521
01:42:48,821 --> 01:42:51,010
They would hire you guys to come in and.
Exactly.

2522
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:53,410
And so that's an important effort
because you know,

2523
01:42:53,411 --> 01:42:56,560
they need the same level of security
that a forward operating base or a

2524
01:42:56,561 --> 01:42:59,110
military base or facility would need,
you know,

2525
01:42:59,111 --> 01:43:01,840
but the military is not going to
allocate resources for a private

2526
01:43:01,841 --> 01:43:04,000
company.
So a lot of what the private contractors

2527
01:43:04,001 --> 01:43:05,790
were doing was that.
And then also private contractors,

2528
01:43:05,860 --> 01:43:09,310
you know,
getting contracts to provide additional

2529
01:43:09,311 --> 01:43:12,710
security support or logistical support
to uh,

2530
01:43:12,730 --> 01:43:15,760
the military to military facilities
where they can't,

2531
01:43:16,130 --> 01:43:16,580
you know,
they,

2532
01:43:16,580 --> 01:43:21,070
they can't afford to allocate resources
to perimeter security and to the degree

2533
01:43:21,071 --> 01:43:21,640
that they would like.

2534
01:43:21,640 --> 01:43:25,480
So private contractors come in and help
with that or providing support in the

2535
01:43:25,481 --> 01:43:29,890
movement of dignitaries or whatever may
be a point being is we're out there for,

2536
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:34,540
for quite some time in Iraq doing that.
And we were there at the beginning of

2537
01:43:34,541 --> 01:43:36,790
sort of this private contractor thing.
Right?

2538
01:43:36,791 --> 01:43:39,460
And people start becoming aware of it
and we started working with groups

2539
01:43:39,461 --> 01:43:44,350
including a Erik prince is a group we
didn't work directly with them,

2540
01:43:44,351 --> 01:43:47,470
but what I mean is the various groups
that are out there doing these contracts

2541
01:43:47,471 --> 01:43:48,520
and this work,
you know,

2542
01:43:48,521 --> 01:43:51,920
realizing that you needed to start to
form an association or started to get

2543
01:43:51,921 --> 01:43:52,130
some

2544
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:55,670
sort of grip on how this thing would
look.

2545
01:43:55,700 --> 01:43:57,380
Right.
So that there was some consistency

2546
01:43:57,381 --> 01:43:59,780
amongst training and what were the
regulations for,

2547
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:00,793
you know,
uh,

2548
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:02,410
the various companies for,
you know,

2549
01:44:02,470 --> 01:44:05,240
weapons and everything else.
It's complicated,

2550
01:44:05,241 --> 01:44:06,680
but you know,
long story short is,

2551
01:44:06,720 --> 01:44:08,960
you know,
we had upwards of 400 people I guess out

2552
01:44:08,961 --> 01:44:11,390
there at a,
at a point providing security and

2553
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:15,020
intelligence support.
So I've got some experience in this and

2554
01:44:15,021 --> 01:44:20,021
now what's happening with Afghanistan is
that one of the options that's been

2555
01:44:20,841 --> 01:44:24,230
being considered is,
is handing over.

2556
01:44:24,231 --> 01:44:27,860
We've got about an 8,400 troops out
there right now doing mostly training

2557
01:44:27,890 --> 01:44:30,230
missions,
training operations and support for the

2558
01:44:30,231 --> 01:44:32,420
Afghan troops.
So the idea was,

2559
01:44:33,010 --> 01:44:35,240
well,
let's let the private contractor take

2560
01:44:35,241 --> 01:44:36,260
that over.
Let's,

2561
01:44:36,290 --> 01:44:38,720
let's move that out.
And let's not have the brave men and

2562
01:44:38,721 --> 01:44:43,070
women of the US military engaged in
Afghanistan ad Nauseum,

2563
01:44:43,380 --> 01:44:45,350
you know,
and this idea is being pushed to some

2564
01:44:45,351 --> 01:44:46,790
degree by Erik Prince,
you know,

2565
01:44:46,791 --> 01:44:48,980
and he's said things like,
well,

2566
01:44:48,981 --> 01:44:49,320
you know,
if,

2567
01:44:49,320 --> 01:44:51,110
you know,
if you want to keep having this

2568
01:44:51,111 --> 01:44:52,670
conversation,
you want to have the conversation 10

2569
01:44:52,671 --> 01:44:54,830
years from now,
Friday the military keep doing it,

2570
01:44:54,860 --> 01:44:56,120
you know,
or we can be more,

2571
01:44:56,150 --> 01:44:58,550
you know,
somehow efficient.

2572
01:44:58,570 --> 01:45:01,880
And they explained that people who Eric
Princes from Blackwater,

2573
01:45:01,881 --> 01:45:03,530
blackwater and yeah,
he came out of a,

2574
01:45:03,580 --> 01:45:06,500
of a,
a wealthy Michigan based family.

2575
01:45:06,501 --> 01:45:09,800
Betsy devoss the cat or the education
secretary is a sister in the current

2576
01:45:09,801 --> 01:45:13,570
administration.
And so he started water and you know,

2577
01:45:13,580 --> 01:45:14,401
they uh,
they,

2578
01:45:14,401 --> 01:45:17,200
they became sort of the face of right
because they,

2579
01:45:17,230 --> 01:45:18,410
they,
they did very well.

2580
01:45:18,411 --> 01:45:20,690
It's a private contractor business.
They got good contracts and that was

2581
01:45:20,691 --> 01:45:22,760
good.
They had some issues and some problems.

2582
01:45:22,761 --> 01:45:24,500
A very controversial,
very controversial.

2583
01:45:24,501 --> 01:45:26,270
They sold the business,
renamed it,

2584
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:27,500
then renamed it again,
and Yada,

2585
01:45:27,501 --> 01:45:30,410
Yada Yada.
But the point being is that the idea

2586
01:45:30,411 --> 01:45:34,730
that somehow you're going to prioritize
this operation in Afghanistan expecting

2587
01:45:34,731 --> 01:45:36,830
then I guess here's the thing,
he,

2588
01:45:36,831 --> 01:45:37,431
because he said,
well,

2589
01:45:37,431 --> 01:45:40,400
it'd be about $10,000,000,000 a year,
which would be a savings on what we

2590
01:45:40,401 --> 01:45:43,550
spend now.
You give private contractors,

2591
01:45:43,570 --> 01:45:43,901
uh,
you know,

2592
01:45:43,901 --> 01:45:46,520
a $10,000,000,000 trough to eat at.

2593
01:45:46,550 --> 01:45:48,410
You think they're going to end it
anytime soon,

2594
01:45:48,780 --> 01:45:52,610
there's no fucking way.
So if we want this thing to just drag on

2595
01:45:52,611 --> 01:45:54,200
ad Nauseum,
fine,

2596
01:45:54,230 --> 01:45:58,280
privatized it and put that profit motive
up there and you think somehow it's not

2597
01:45:58,281 --> 01:46:00,980
going to happen.
And I can ever to say that as a private

2598
01:46:00,981 --> 01:46:03,020
contractor in that had been involved in
it.

2599
01:46:03,320 --> 01:46:04,430
Well,
I appreciate your honesty.

2600
01:46:04,660 --> 01:46:05,930
Not I just,
it's just,

2601
01:46:06,020 --> 01:46:08,840
it's the wrong thing to do.
And if not top of that,

2602
01:46:08,841 --> 01:46:10,430
if I guess the,
the,

2603
01:46:10,431 --> 01:46:14,510
the overlying,
the 30,000 foot view that I've got is

2604
01:46:14,511 --> 01:46:17,660
that if it's important enough for us to
be there,

2605
01:46:17,930 --> 01:46:20,030
then that's a military function.
That's,

2606
01:46:20,100 --> 01:46:23,270
that's.
Then we have to commit in a way that,

2607
01:46:23,330 --> 01:46:24,500
you know,
we're not right now,

2608
01:46:24,501 --> 01:46:29,270
we've been in this sort of stalemate
situation right over there and now we're

2609
01:46:29,330 --> 01:46:32,150
somewhat surprised.
Are people are surprised at the Taliban

2610
01:46:32,390 --> 01:46:33,620
is resurgent,
well,

2611
01:46:33,710 --> 01:46:36,140
where the hell did they think they were
going to go?

2612
01:46:36,710 --> 01:46:39,340
There's Taliban don't have any place to
go there.

2613
01:46:39,530 --> 01:46:43,940
So they're gonna wait us out.
This was entirely predictable that some

2614
01:46:43,941 --> 01:46:47,780
and what we're trying to sell them this
pseudo federal democracy,

2615
01:46:47,870 --> 01:46:49,530
you know?
Then the Afghan people don't understand

2616
01:46:49,560 --> 01:46:50,670
for the most part,
I don't think,

2617
01:46:50,671 --> 01:46:52,770
maybe I'm just too cynical,
but they don't understand what the hell

2618
01:46:52,771 --> 01:46:54,240
we've been trying to sell them for all
these years.

2619
01:46:54,840 --> 01:46:59,160
So this doesn't diminish all the pain
and sacrifice and suffering of all

2620
01:46:59,161 --> 01:47:02,070
people that have been out there and the
lives that we've lost.

2621
01:47:02,071 --> 01:47:04,770
It doesn't diminish it at all.
What I'm saying is that we need to think

2622
01:47:04,771 --> 01:47:06,780
about what's our,
what's our end game,

2623
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:09,810
what's our objective?
So if we're worried now about the

2624
01:47:09,811 --> 01:47:12,030
Taliban resurging and Isis,
you know,

2625
01:47:12,031 --> 01:47:13,770
kind of coming back in,
well fine,

2626
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:16,590
but let's,
let's say this is our objective and to

2627
01:47:16,591 --> 01:47:19,410
meet that objective,
then we're going to need more troops on

2628
01:47:19,411 --> 01:47:21,330
the ground and let's see how that plays
out.

2629
01:47:21,330 --> 01:47:23,160
I don't think a lot of people are going
to be happy about it.

2630
01:47:23,370 --> 01:47:25,290
You don't necessarily do things to make
people happy.

2631
01:47:25,291 --> 01:47:28,350
If it's a national security interests.
If we decide that that's in our national

2632
01:47:28,351 --> 01:47:29,760
security interest,
then yes,

2633
01:47:29,761 --> 01:47:33,600
we need to commit and do it.
But handing it over to a privatized,

2634
01:47:34,250 --> 01:47:36,440
you know,
force to me is,

2635
01:47:36,470 --> 01:47:37,750
is uh,
is,

2636
01:47:37,770 --> 01:47:40,800
is just slightly left of insane.
It doesn't make any sense.

2637
01:47:41,220 --> 01:47:43,710
And you know,
it's always easy for people to stand

2638
01:47:43,711 --> 01:47:45,900
around and talk tough and say we just
need more troops.

2639
01:47:46,200 --> 01:47:47,033
You know?
Well,

2640
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:52,830
I don't know that the objective is
sufficiently clarified to say that we

2641
01:47:52,831 --> 01:47:54,570
need more troops.
I haven't heard.

2642
01:47:54,571 --> 01:47:57,720
I don't care whether we improve the
literacy rate of the Afghan people by

2643
01:47:57,721 --> 01:48:00,240
another percentage point of if we build
another road.

2644
01:48:00,510 --> 01:48:03,690
I don't think that's in our national
security interests and so I think we

2645
01:48:03,691 --> 01:48:05,850
need to be a little bit more clear about
why we're there,

2646
01:48:05,851 --> 01:48:07,290
what we're hoping to accomplish.

2647
01:48:07,290 --> 01:48:10,470
At some point we wanted to be there so
that we wouldn't use it as a playground

2648
01:48:10,740 --> 01:48:14,850
for terrorists to then develop and plot
and plan and attack the West again,

2649
01:48:15,930 --> 01:48:18,630
so maybe the thing that will,
what we should have done was go in

2650
01:48:18,631 --> 01:48:20,310
there,
kick the shit out of them that like we

2651
01:48:20,311 --> 01:48:24,300
did in Tora Bora and elsewhere,
explained to the remnants of the

2652
01:48:24,301 --> 01:48:26,340
government.
If you allow that to happen again,

2653
01:48:26,341 --> 01:48:29,220
we're going to come back and we'll do
this again and we're very good at that.

2654
01:48:29,221 --> 01:48:32,670
We're very good at strategic operations
and we could have done that and maybe

2655
01:48:32,671 --> 01:48:35,550
that's the thing we need to do now.
And then that government's been corrupt

2656
01:48:35,551 --> 01:48:37,710
for a very long time.
The Karzai government,

2657
01:48:37,711 --> 01:48:40,710
Holy Shit.
They were completely corrupt and yet we

2658
01:48:40,711 --> 01:48:43,800
all rallied around cars.
I as if he was because he dressed well.

2659
01:48:44,290 --> 01:48:45,870
One of his brother was a heroin.

2660
01:48:45,910 --> 01:48:46,970
Yes.
Yeah.

2661
01:48:47,030 --> 01:48:48,670
It's awful.
And you know,

2662
01:48:48,680 --> 01:48:50,520
in the current government is,
is it any better?

2663
01:48:50,521 --> 01:48:52,260
Well,
they're a little more clever at hiding

2664
01:48:52,261 --> 01:48:54,210
their corruption,
but it's still exists.

2665
01:48:54,211 --> 01:48:56,560
And more importantly,
the tribal society there,

2666
01:48:56,700 --> 01:48:58,980
it doesn't really get this idea of,
you know,

2667
01:48:58,981 --> 01:49:00,960
a strong central government,
you know,

2668
01:49:01,350 --> 01:49:04,580
it kind of runs counter to thousands of
years of,

2669
01:49:04,620 --> 01:49:06,360
of self governance out there.
But anyway,

2670
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:07,860
so that's,
that's the thing.

2671
01:49:07,861 --> 01:49:09,150
So what,
what's he gonna say tonight?

2672
01:49:09,151 --> 01:49:10,560
I don't have a clue,
but I think he's,

2673
01:49:10,580 --> 01:49:12,030
he does.
He's got limited opera job.

2674
01:49:12,090 --> 01:49:13,380
What's it going to take?
We're going to cut and run.

2675
01:49:13,381 --> 01:49:15,030
We're going to leave.
That's one option.

2676
01:49:15,180 --> 01:49:18,600
We're going to increase the number of US
troops on the ground.

2677
01:49:18,630 --> 01:49:21,210
That's one option is right there.
It's a trump,

2678
01:49:21,980 --> 01:49:22,780
4,000

2679
01:49:22,780 --> 01:49:24,340
more troops to Afghanistan.
Is that,

2680
01:49:24,520 --> 01:49:27,220
is that good?
Now here's the thing about when it comes

2681
01:49:27,221 --> 01:49:30,670
to operations over there and what are,
what the objectives are.

2682
01:49:30,910 --> 01:49:33,490
One of the things that I've been hearing
from people that are in the military

2683
01:49:33,491 --> 01:49:38,440
that I know is they say they are happy
that trump is supporting them and that

2684
01:49:38,441 --> 01:49:40,930
trump has kind of essentially giving the
reigns,

2685
01:49:40,931 --> 01:49:42,010
the military saying,
look,

2686
01:49:42,040 --> 01:49:44,800
this is what you guys do.
I'm not going to get in your way.

2687
01:49:44,801 --> 01:49:47,890
In fact I'm going to support you,
and there seemed to one of the few

2688
01:49:47,891 --> 01:49:48,610
groups

2689
01:49:48,610 --> 01:49:52,720
that is fairly universally happy with
his decisions in that regard and with

2690
01:49:52,721 --> 01:49:54,490
the people that he's appointed.
I think that's right.

2691
01:49:54,491 --> 01:49:56,360
I think law enforcement as well,
I think is it?

2692
01:49:56,380 --> 01:49:58,240
Yeah.
If you feel like you've got top cover,

2693
01:49:58,430 --> 01:49:59,950
you know,
then you know,

2694
01:49:59,990 --> 01:50:02,120
that was one of the problems.
I mean people talked about the art and

2695
01:50:02,140 --> 01:50:05,410
we talked about it briefly about the
idea of the sort of the narrative of

2696
01:50:06,010 --> 01:50:09,400
sort of a battle between trump and the
intel community where the community had

2697
01:50:09,401 --> 01:50:12,280
a problem with the previous
administration because they kept

2698
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:15,220
shifting the goal posts.
They were going to criminally prosecute

2699
01:50:15,221 --> 01:50:19,450
people in the agency for engaging in
that interrogation program and rendition

2700
01:50:19,451 --> 01:50:24,380
program that had been approved by the
previous administration that you know,

2701
01:50:24,610 --> 01:50:27,640
that creates some ill will,
so the fact that you know,

2702
01:50:27,670 --> 01:50:29,320
the military and,
and to some degree,

2703
01:50:29,321 --> 01:50:31,170
you know,
others and certainly law enforcement of

2704
01:50:31,180 --> 01:50:34,090
feel as if they've got this top cover
from the current administration.

2705
01:50:34,090 --> 01:50:35,290
That is a good thing.
And if you're,

2706
01:50:35,320 --> 01:50:39,340
if you're willing to not politicize all
of this and,

2707
01:50:39,341 --> 01:50:41,680
and,
and make every decision related to

2708
01:50:41,681 --> 01:50:45,250
national security based on how you think
it's gonna move the polls,

2709
01:50:45,700 --> 01:50:50,470
then that's also a good thing.
As long as you're getting good solid

2710
01:50:50,471 --> 01:50:54,340
advice and you're consistent in your
decision making process,

2711
01:50:54,341 --> 01:50:56,030
all those things are good.
Um,

2712
01:50:56,350 --> 01:51:00,130
I don't know enough about trump to know
how,

2713
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:02,680
you know,
he makes those decisions,

2714
01:51:02,681 --> 01:51:05,920
but he does have good of Madison's good
pump peo is a good person.

2715
01:51:06,190 --> 01:51:07,020
John Kelly,
certainly.

2716
01:51:07,020 --> 01:51:07,870
Great Guy.
Mcmaster,

2717
01:51:07,871 --> 01:51:11,590
all these people are solid people who in
any other administration would,

2718
01:51:11,670 --> 01:51:12,890
you know,
people would be saying,

2719
01:51:12,900 --> 01:51:13,600
yeah,
that's great.

2720
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:14,860
You know,
they're very highly regarded,

2721
01:51:15,190 --> 01:51:17,230
but it's sort of,
there's this cloud over because it's

2722
01:51:17,231 --> 01:51:22,231
trump and people are still not sure how
things play out in that administration,

2723
01:51:22,481 --> 01:51:24,640
but if he does listen,
I think yeah,

2724
01:51:24,641 --> 01:51:25,180
that's a good thing.

2725
01:51:25,180 --> 01:51:29,140
But sending 4,000 more troops,
that's not quite 50 percent on top of

2726
01:51:29,141 --> 01:51:31,490
what we've currently got there.
Um,

2727
01:51:32,290 --> 01:51:34,050
what does that allow us to do?
Well,

2728
01:51:34,060 --> 01:51:38,440
some of those troops are going to have
to be involved in security operations of

2729
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:40,060
the trainers.
Some of those troops are going to have

2730
01:51:40,061 --> 01:51:41,320
to be involved in,
you know,

2731
01:51:41,400 --> 01:51:43,480
logistical support,
Intel collection support.

2732
01:51:43,481 --> 01:51:44,560
So,
you know,

2733
01:51:44,561 --> 01:51:49,561
will it make us more effective in
defeating and the short term some of the

2734
01:51:50,681 --> 01:51:54,880
pushback from the Taliban and
identifying and taking out more isis

2735
01:51:54,881 --> 01:51:55,714
will.
Sure.

2736
01:51:56,050 --> 01:51:57,880
Okay.
And then,

2737
01:51:57,890 --> 01:51:59,580
and then what?
I guess that's my question.

2738
01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:00,530
What,
what,

2739
01:52:00,530 --> 01:52:03,430
what are we doing?
What is our objective in Afghanistan

2740
01:52:03,431 --> 01:52:06,070
today in 2017?
What is the objective?

2741
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:10,180
I couldn't eloquently,
not that I could add eloquently do shit,

2742
01:52:10,181 --> 01:52:13,360
but I couldn't.
I couldn't state what our end game is

2743
01:52:13,361 --> 01:52:14,380
there.
I think it's,

2744
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:19,120
I would suppose in a big picture,
it's to create a stable society that

2745
01:52:19,420 --> 01:52:23,530
will be a bulwark of some form of
democracy.

2746
01:52:23,531 --> 01:52:24,660
Have we ever done that thought?
I mean,

2747
01:52:24,680 --> 01:52:27,370
we ever had successfully been involved
in nation building.

2748
01:52:27,580 --> 01:52:29,020
We have,
what did you think about,

2749
01:52:29,021 --> 01:52:30,790
um,
post World War II,

2750
01:52:32,110 --> 01:52:33,770
but that was again at different times.
I mean,

2751
01:52:34,030 --> 01:52:37,260
so you can't compare it necessarily,
you know,

2752
01:52:37,330 --> 01:52:42,330
chronologically I,
so when we've invaded places or when

2753
01:52:42,821 --> 01:52:45,410
we've been a part of like,
look what's going on in Libya,

2754
01:52:45,770 --> 01:52:46,010
I mean

2755
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:49,160
we,
we supported that revolution and now

2756
01:52:49,161 --> 01:52:52,820
it's a fucking complete disaster and a
terrifying part of the world.

2757
01:52:52,821 --> 01:52:55,580
Yeah.
It's a real hot mess and nobody wants to

2758
01:52:55,581 --> 01:53:00,581
talk about Libya and we didn't have a
national security interest in Libya and

2759
01:53:01,010 --> 01:53:03,560
yet we allow ourselves to get in there.
Why did we do that?

2760
01:53:04,070 --> 01:53:07,580
A lot of pressure from the French and
the Italians who did,

2761
01:53:08,630 --> 01:53:12,290
and I think we felt it was somehow.
I don't know why,

2762
01:53:12,291 --> 01:53:14,630
but maybe there was a feeling as if it
would be easier,

2763
01:53:14,690 --> 01:53:17,240
more containable somehow.
But I mean,

2764
01:53:17,480 --> 01:53:19,370
shit,
there's more tribal history.

2765
01:53:19,371 --> 01:53:21,530
More tribes in Libya than in
Afghanistan.

2766
01:53:21,531 --> 01:53:21,931
It's,
you know,

2767
01:53:21,931 --> 01:53:25,690
you had to get like 130 some odd tribes
in Olympia.

2768
01:53:25,790 --> 01:53:27,860
So another thing that I watched recently
as a,

2769
01:53:27,861 --> 01:53:29,570
as a country,
so

2770
01:53:31,590 --> 01:53:36,590
watch Qaddafi's death again recently and
watched the whole capture of him and the

2771
01:53:37,190 --> 01:53:37,920
whole thing.

2772
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:42,920
It was just fascinating to watch his
brutal evil murderer is dictator.

2773
01:53:43,221 --> 01:53:46,370
All the sudden get caught by these
common people.

2774
01:53:46,371 --> 01:53:48,010
These rebels,
you know,

2775
01:53:48,011 --> 01:53:48,530
like,
you know,

2776
01:53:48,530 --> 01:53:51,950
outside of his palace and freaking out.
And yeah,

2777
01:53:52,040 --> 01:53:54,560
players all fucked up.
And the weird thing is he was,

2778
01:53:54,740 --> 01:53:57,380
he was our guy,
he was a dictator.

2779
01:53:57,890 --> 01:54:01,720
Renounced.
He had gotten on board for the most part

2780
01:54:01,730 --> 01:54:06,730
on sort of a counterterrorism program to
provide assistance or support or at

2781
01:54:06,861 --> 01:54:09,710
least not impede A.
I'm not saying it was,

2782
01:54:09,720 --> 01:54:10,151
yeah,
it was a,

2783
01:54:10,151 --> 01:54:13,910
it was a complete son of a bitch.
But it's interesting isn't it?

2784
01:54:13,940 --> 01:54:17,300
The dynamics involved.
And so we decided that it was better to

2785
01:54:17,301 --> 01:54:19,580
support the French and Italians and
topple him.

2786
01:54:20,180 --> 01:54:22,460
And now you know,
it's,

2787
01:54:22,490 --> 01:54:23,540
I mean,
but that's always the case.

2788
01:54:23,541 --> 01:54:25,040
You know,
isn't always the case too that we have

2789
01:54:25,041 --> 01:54:27,730
these dictators we problem up and then
after a while,

2790
01:54:27,910 --> 01:54:29,030
Jesus,
this fucking guy,

2791
01:54:29,031 --> 01:54:29,900
we've got to get them out of there.

2792
01:54:30,130 --> 01:54:31,170
Like so dumb.
Yeah.

2793
01:54:31,550 --> 01:54:35,840
Sort of same and Hussein lasted a long
time in that position.

2794
01:54:35,841 --> 01:54:39,230
When you think about the horrific nature
of some of the shit that he did and his

2795
01:54:39,231 --> 01:54:40,450
sons did.
Oh yeah.

2796
01:54:40,540 --> 01:54:43,090
Sons were completely monsters.
Yeah.

2797
01:54:43,460 --> 01:54:44,271
And that's a good point.
I mean,

2798
01:54:44,271 --> 01:54:44,870
you know,
and,

2799
01:54:44,870 --> 01:54:45,830
but you know,
hey,

2800
01:54:45,831 --> 01:54:50,831
how did it,
how did his presence when they were at

2801
01:54:50,931 --> 01:54:52,230
odds with Iran,
you know,

2802
01:54:52,310 --> 01:54:57,310
how did that help our overall sense of
strategic foreign policy?

2803
01:54:59,540 --> 01:55:01,670
So things happen and you don't,
you know,

2804
01:55:01,671 --> 01:55:03,140
it's,
you don't get to pick and choose

2805
01:55:03,141 --> 01:55:05,180
sometimes I guess maybe you do,
but then it'd be,

2806
01:55:05,900 --> 01:55:09,050
it'd be a kind of a strange world,
but you got to deal with sometimes with

2807
01:55:09,051 --> 01:55:11,830
the people that are out there and,
and you know,

2808
01:55:12,010 --> 01:55:14,630
um,
so it's,

2809
01:55:15,080 --> 01:55:15,890
I,
I don't know,

2810
01:55:15,890 --> 01:55:17,850
4,000 more troops in Afghanistan.
I,

2811
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:21,080
is that going to somehow solve a
problem?

2812
01:55:21,081 --> 01:55:22,820
It's going to,
I suspect,

2813
01:55:22,821 --> 01:55:24,490
kick the can down the road.
Again.

2814
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:26,090
It's like Vietnam.
What would you do?

2815
01:55:26,120 --> 01:55:28,340
Where did the vehicle have to go?
They had nowhere to go.

2816
01:55:29,140 --> 01:55:30,740
It's a totally different situation
though,

2817
01:55:30,741 --> 01:55:32,210
isn't it?
Because the Viet Cong really didn't have

2818
01:55:32,211 --> 01:55:33,710
any threat to us.
Well,

2819
01:55:33,711 --> 01:55:36,170
what I mean is,
is what did we think was gonna Happen?

2820
01:55:36,470 --> 01:55:38,660
They were going to outweighed us.
They were going to have glasses.

2821
01:55:38,661 --> 01:55:42,200
They were going to say the suffering was
nothing in their minds compared to what

2822
01:55:42,201 --> 01:55:44,460
we were going through and how we were
processing.

2823
01:55:44,460 --> 01:55:45,910
And so I guess that's what I mean.
You can't.

2824
01:55:45,930 --> 01:55:46,620
Yeah,
everything is,

2825
01:55:46,620 --> 01:55:47,221
is,
is,

2826
01:55:47,221 --> 01:55:48,480
uh,
is relative,

2827
01:55:48,481 --> 01:55:49,880
but I mean with this,
um,

2828
01:55:50,140 --> 01:55:51,580
what would you do?
Well,

2829
01:55:51,590 --> 01:55:53,460
I have,
you were in the situation to call the

2830
01:55:53,461 --> 01:55:54,360
shots.
If someone said,

2831
01:55:54,361 --> 01:55:55,860
hey,
Mike Baker,

2832
01:55:56,250 --> 01:55:58,170
what do we do about Afghanistan?
Yeah.

2833
01:55:58,340 --> 01:55:59,250
And you know what,
I'm,

2834
01:56:00,310 --> 01:56:00,931
it's,
it's,

2835
01:56:00,931 --> 01:56:01,690
it's,
it,

2836
01:56:01,690 --> 01:56:04,020
it.
I'm not saying it's an easy by any

2837
01:56:04,021 --> 01:56:05,280
means.
It's a,

2838
01:56:05,310 --> 01:56:06,630
it's above my pay grade,
but b,

2839
01:56:07,320 --> 01:56:11,610
I think I'm.
Isis creates a different situation

2840
01:56:11,640 --> 01:56:15,960
there.
If we hadn't seen isis develop and start

2841
01:56:15,961 --> 01:56:19,680
to impact to some degree things that are
going on in Afghanistan,

2842
01:56:20,100 --> 01:56:23,220
then I think we could be better off just
saying,

2843
01:56:23,250 --> 01:56:23,850
okay,
we're gonna.

2844
01:56:23,850 --> 01:56:26,670
Figure out a way to work with the
Taliban.

2845
01:56:26,710 --> 01:56:30,090
I mean the Taliban,
I think at this stage of the game could

2846
01:56:30,091 --> 01:56:34,440
be contained within Afghanistan without
allowing their place to be used as a

2847
01:56:34,441 --> 01:56:35,850
shelter for terrorism.

2848
01:56:36,380 --> 01:56:40,260
I say that now caveating saying now
you've got isis and that's a different

2849
01:56:40,261 --> 01:56:42,870
kettle of fish because they're at odds
with each other.

2850
01:56:43,410 --> 01:56:44,460
So what are we going to do?
I ended up,

2851
01:56:44,500 --> 01:56:46,500
you know,
in some weird fashion supporting the

2852
01:56:46,501 --> 01:56:48,270
Taliban and their efforts to,
you know,

2853
01:56:48,420 --> 01:56:50,940
stamp out isis.
I don't know.

2854
01:56:50,970 --> 01:56:51,803
It's a,
it's a,

2855
01:56:52,240 --> 01:56:53,550
it's real weird.
Yeah.

2856
01:56:54,510 --> 01:56:58,260
This is what we're talking.
Thousands of years of history of failed

2857
01:56:58,261 --> 01:57:01,020
efforts in Afghanistan.
And do I think,

2858
01:57:01,021 --> 01:57:03,450
do I have the Hubris to think that we
somehow are going to solve this?

2859
01:57:03,451 --> 01:57:04,830
No.
So,

2860
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:09,000
you know,
maybe maybe the answer is just find that

2861
01:57:09,001 --> 01:57:13,620
point on the curve where you can support
an existing government that you can hold

2862
01:57:13,621 --> 01:57:15,250
your nose and live with.
It's,

2863
01:57:15,270 --> 01:57:18,020
you know,
that it's corrupt and you know,

2864
01:57:18,030 --> 01:57:22,020
but at least they're working in the
counter terrorism realm,

2865
01:57:22,230 --> 01:57:24,600
you know,
and they're there supporting those sort

2866
01:57:24,601 --> 01:57:26,040
of interests from our perspective.

2867
01:57:26,670 --> 01:57:28,320
And yet,
you know,

2868
01:57:28,321 --> 01:57:31,530
I don't think we're ever going to get to
that point where we see a stable self

2869
01:57:31,550 --> 01:57:32,830
supporting,
you know,

2870
01:57:33,060 --> 01:57:36,630
pseudo democratic nation exist there.
I just don't think it's going to happen.

2871
01:57:37,020 --> 01:57:42,020
So that's a hugely unsatisfying answer.
But you know,

2872
01:57:42,181 --> 01:57:43,890
maybe it's,
maybe it's like pollution.

2873
01:57:43,891 --> 01:57:46,200
You do little things,
you know and hope that it helps.

2874
01:57:46,680 --> 01:57:48,570
And maybe that's what we're doing here.
You know,

2875
01:57:48,571 --> 01:57:50,700
if you just start from the point of view
of saying we're going to create a

2876
01:57:50,701 --> 01:57:52,830
bulwark of democracy,
you overwhelmed,

2877
01:57:52,831 --> 01:57:54,510
it's never going to happen.
So you don't do anything.

2878
01:57:54,610 --> 01:57:55,940
You know,
background.

2879
01:57:56,260 --> 01:57:57,450
I,
part of me just,

2880
01:57:57,451 --> 01:57:59,610
I hate the idea of leaving,
right?

2881
01:57:59,660 --> 01:58:02,410
I mean,
I think a lot of people do who are

2882
01:58:02,420 --> 01:58:03,690
living,
we're going to create a vacuum,

2883
01:58:03,691 --> 01:58:04,360
right?
Right.

2884
01:58:04,360 --> 01:58:05,400
And,
and quite frankly,

2885
01:58:05,401 --> 01:58:07,050
that's typically what happens,
you know,

2886
01:58:07,060 --> 01:58:10,440
and particularly with isis president
said they would see that and they would

2887
01:58:10,441 --> 01:58:11,400
see an opportunity.

2888
01:58:11,850 --> 01:58:12,601
Now,
you know,

2889
01:58:12,601 --> 01:58:13,140
they,
they're,

2890
01:58:13,140 --> 01:58:15,750
they're at odds with the Taliban and the
Taliban is pretty brutal.

2891
01:58:16,050 --> 01:58:17,880
Um,
could they handle it on their own,

2892
01:58:17,900 --> 01:58:18,511
you know,
meaning,

2893
01:58:18,511 --> 01:58:21,540
could they destroy isis on their own?
Who knows?

2894
01:58:21,570 --> 01:58:23,070
Maybe,
but it's a,

2895
01:58:23,071 --> 01:58:25,320
it certainly complicates the situation.
But now,

2896
01:58:25,400 --> 01:58:30,240
especially if we just decide to switch
somehow or another support isis now,

2897
01:58:30,270 --> 01:58:31,800
that's never going to happen.
Whenever.

2898
01:58:31,830 --> 01:58:32,663
No,
I mean,

2899
01:58:32,670 --> 01:58:34,170
excuse me,
the Taliban,

2900
01:58:34,790 --> 01:58:36,900
their battle against Isis could see
that.

2901
01:58:37,680 --> 01:58:40,560
I could see elements of the Taliban
saying,

2902
01:58:40,561 --> 01:58:42,640
look,
we just want to self govern.

2903
01:58:42,940 --> 01:58:43,870
Right?
Okay,

2904
01:58:43,871 --> 01:58:44,830
we get it.
But you're not going to

2905
01:58:45,030 --> 01:58:48,830
imagine a scenario where the United
States would support the Taliban because

2906
01:58:48,831 --> 01:58:52,400
they were at war with Isis.
Taliban could soften their stance on

2907
01:58:52,401 --> 01:58:54,440
some things.
We reached some sort of common ground.

2908
01:58:54,610 --> 01:58:58,300
Well look,
we're kind of on the same side with Iran

2909
01:58:58,301 --> 01:59:01,750
against Isis right?
And we're not supporting Iran in a way.

2910
01:59:01,751 --> 01:59:05,380
We are in a sense that we're,
we're trying to kill the same people.

2911
01:59:05,500 --> 01:59:07,780
Right?
So who would have thought that,

2912
01:59:07,840 --> 01:59:09,340
you know,
four or five years ago.

2913
01:59:09,370 --> 01:59:11,770
So that's how nutty Isis says.
Yeah,

2914
01:59:11,860 --> 01:59:12,551
yeah,
yeah.

2915
01:59:12,551 --> 01:59:14,210
Everybody can agree.
Everybody get a great.

2916
01:59:14,730 --> 01:59:16,840
That's the one group that everybody can
agree on.

2917
01:59:17,230 --> 01:59:19,270
Um,
but yeah,

2918
01:59:19,360 --> 01:59:20,380
I don't know.
It's interesting.

2919
01:59:20,381 --> 01:59:22,780
So that's what the president's going to
talk about this evening.

2920
01:59:22,781 --> 01:59:25,270
4,000 more troops.
I,

2921
01:59:25,271 --> 01:59:29,140
you know,
he could have said we're gonna leave and

2922
01:59:29,350 --> 01:59:32,320
the people that hate trump would be up
in arms.

2923
01:59:32,321 --> 01:59:34,570
You could say we're going to add 40,000
troops are going to be up in arms.

2924
01:59:34,571 --> 01:59:36,580
You could say we're going to give it
over to the private contractors.

2925
01:59:36,581 --> 01:59:37,960
They'd be up in arms.
It doesn't really matter.

2926
01:59:38,200 --> 01:59:40,240
So there's going to be a lot of
opposition to this regardless.

2927
01:59:40,810 --> 01:59:43,450
Um,
if there's a clear defined mission with

2928
01:59:43,451 --> 01:59:45,250
an end game,
fine.

2929
01:59:45,700 --> 01:59:47,470
I just haven't heard.
I don't know what that is.

2930
01:59:47,740 --> 01:59:49,600
And maybe they,
maybe they've said it and I just haven't

2931
01:59:49,601 --> 01:59:50,150
seen it.

2932
01:59:50,150 --> 01:59:52,640
Well,
it seems like the only way we're ever

2933
01:59:52,641 --> 01:59:56,210
going to get peace and harmony in the
world is if there's no fifth world,

2934
01:59:56,211 --> 01:59:58,430
fourth world,
third world or second world.

2935
01:59:58,460 --> 02:00:02,690
Just one first world.
Everybody has like suburban problems.

2936
02:00:02,770 --> 02:00:03,640
Yeah.
Yeah.

2937
02:00:04,120 --> 02:00:05,490
Is that even possible?
No.

2938
02:00:05,560 --> 02:00:08,290
I mean,
I never society where everybody's on the

2939
02:00:08,291 --> 02:00:09,760
same footing.
Impossible.

2940
02:00:10,230 --> 02:00:15,230
A universal basic income and a cross the
world and get rid of law enforcement.

2941
02:00:17,100 --> 02:00:19,600
Doing exactly.
No everywhere.

2942
02:00:19,630 --> 02:00:20,680
I don't think that's it.
Yeah,

2943
02:00:20,710 --> 02:00:22,350
it's not gonna happen and I,

2944
02:00:22,660 --> 02:00:27,110
that's so disheartening for people
though to a guy like you as so many

2945
02:00:27,130 --> 02:00:32,130
years of experience in intelligence
agencies that you would say that there's

2946
02:00:33,431 --> 02:00:36,910
nothing that could ever be done that
would give peace in the world.

2947
02:00:36,911 --> 02:00:40,180
Like generations from now,
we're still going to be dealing with the

2948
02:00:40,181 --> 02:00:41,014
same issues.

2949
02:00:41,100 --> 02:00:45,560
Maybe if the chemist can figure out a
way to get us all so next to see mean

2950
02:00:45,561 --> 02:00:47,410
that's going to solve it.
Yeah.

2951
02:00:47,440 --> 02:00:47,881
No,
I don't know.

2952
02:00:47,881 --> 02:00:48,250
You know,
it's,

2953
02:00:48,250 --> 02:00:49,300
it's,
it's the way it is.

2954
02:00:49,301 --> 02:00:50,950
It's human nature.
And um,

2955
02:00:52,020 --> 02:00:52,853
I,
you know,

2956
02:00:53,330 --> 02:00:54,930
we have,
we go through periods of pace,

2957
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:57,700
you can go through periods of prosperity
and during those periods it kind of

2958
02:00:57,701 --> 02:01:01,030
helps to lift everybody up and they get
to a certain level that they didn't

2959
02:01:01,031 --> 02:01:03,670
imagine before.
There's still trailing.

2960
02:01:03,700 --> 02:01:05,950
But are we ever going to get to a point
where we're all,

2961
02:01:06,530 --> 02:01:08,500
you know,
we're all the same.

2962
02:01:08,501 --> 02:01:09,334
I don't,
I,

2963
02:01:09,820 --> 02:01:11,620
I mean I hate great,
but I don't see it.

2964
02:01:12,520 --> 02:01:13,750
Here's the perfect xenical

2965
02:01:13,980 --> 02:01:15,510
the United States in Germany,
right?

2966
02:01:15,511 --> 02:01:18,660
We were at war in the 19 forties and now
we're absolutely a piece.

2967
02:01:19,180 --> 02:01:23,720
I mean this in Germany is prosperous and
it's a great country and everything's

2968
02:01:23,730 --> 02:01:24,720
great.
I mean,

2969
02:01:25,200 --> 02:01:30,060
I would wonder what would have to take
place for this to be a worldwide thing

2970
02:01:30,120 --> 02:01:34,740
where the rest of the world sort of
rises up to an adequate level of

2971
02:01:34,741 --> 02:01:39,741
civilization and we no longer engage and
the potential global war

2972
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:42,650
that we're all looking at right now.
And we're really looking at the

2973
02:01:42,651 --> 02:01:47,240
possibility with Russia and with North
Korea and all these different players.

2974
02:01:47,600 --> 02:01:50,380
There could be some sort of a twisted
world war three going on.

2975
02:01:50,620 --> 02:01:53,780
Russia is,
Russia is punching over its weight.

2976
02:01:54,280 --> 02:01:56,480
I mean at the end of the day,
Russia's got to GDP,

2977
02:01:56,900 --> 02:02:00,170
you know,
equivalent to a midsize EU country.

2978
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:00,801
Right.
I mean,

2979
02:02:00,801 --> 02:02:01,960
so they just,
you know,

2980
02:02:02,020 --> 02:02:04,610
at Putin is very clear.
He wants to rebuild the Soviet Union to

2981
02:02:04,611 --> 02:02:06,200
some degree in some fashion.
Right.

2982
02:02:06,201 --> 02:02:07,980
And he's been,
he's done it through some territory.

2983
02:02:07,981 --> 02:02:11,450
It doesn't do energy policy through
meddling like they always do,

2984
02:02:11,810 --> 02:02:12,643
but.
So,

2985
02:02:12,690 --> 02:02:13,550
you know,
I don't think Russia,

2986
02:02:13,551 --> 02:02:15,650
but to your point,
yeah,

2987
02:02:15,651 --> 02:02:17,590
as with the US Germany,
could we see a,

2988
02:02:17,870 --> 02:02:22,870
a way that the US and Iran for example,
could find common ground and suddenly 40

2989
02:02:22,971 --> 02:02:26,240
years from now be at peace and not only
a piece but supporting each other's

2990
02:02:26,241 --> 02:02:29,420
economy and you know,
have that sort of interaction.

2991
02:02:29,450 --> 02:02:32,150
And
I dunno,

2992
02:02:32,300 --> 02:02:34,030
I don't think so.
Thanks.

2993
02:02:34,090 --> 02:02:37,140
So damn.
Can I pour some coffee and I'm good.

2994
02:02:37,310 --> 02:02:38,510
I'm just thinking.
I'm just like,

2995
02:02:38,920 --> 02:02:41,000
just at a certain point in time,
it just,

2996
02:02:42,050 --> 02:02:46,430
it's very frustrating to think that.
I guess the pace of progress is so

2997
02:02:46,431 --> 02:02:48,350
incredibly slow.
When you look back in history,

2998
02:02:48,351 --> 02:02:51,110
this is probably the safest time to be
alive ever.

2999
02:02:51,111 --> 02:02:55,250
So there's been some progress from Roman
times to today.

3000
02:02:55,340 --> 02:02:57,530
There's obviously been some worldwide
progress.

3001
02:02:57,560 --> 02:02:58,011
Oh,
sure.

3002
02:02:58,011 --> 02:02:58,701
Yeah,
yeah.

3003
02:02:58,701 --> 02:03:01,980
Longevity and stamping out disease and
all the rest of those things.

3004
02:03:02,080 --> 02:03:04,010
Where is like,
you know,

3005
02:03:04,070 --> 02:03:06,770
for what it's worth,
it's a great time to be alive and people

3006
02:03:06,771 --> 02:03:10,280
that are walking around everyday trying
to find a reason to be offended or

3007
02:03:10,340 --> 02:03:14,570
finding that it is because there's no
real conflict that they have these

3008
02:03:14,571 --> 02:03:18,760
issues that the words aren't coming over
the border to know,

3009
02:03:18,880 --> 02:03:19,360
to,
uh,

3010
02:03:19,360 --> 02:03:20,610
to rape and pillage,
you know,

3011
02:03:20,690 --> 02:03:21,710
Great Depression.

3012
02:03:22,040 --> 02:03:26,090
There's food will display easy to find.
They did find the plague that did found

3013
02:03:26,091 --> 02:03:27,740
the P bionic plague on some ticks,
right?

3014
02:03:27,800 --> 02:03:29,060
Yep.
Where was that?

3015
02:03:29,210 --> 02:03:33,050
Was that in Arizona?
I figured it was God Damn Arizona.

3016
02:03:34,290 --> 02:03:36,260
It's a response to Joe,
our pio,

3017
02:03:36,261 --> 02:03:38,060
getting arrested.
Everybody's mad.

3018
02:03:38,120 --> 02:03:42,080
I wonder if that's what it wasn't there.
Some talk about trump pardoning him.

3019
02:03:42,170 --> 02:03:43,840
Yeah.
What does he get?

3020
02:03:43,850 --> 02:03:47,630
His bubonic plague and Arizona Fleas
found carrying the infectious disease.

3021
02:03:47,650 --> 02:03:50,260
There you go.
Wonderful Guy.

3022
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:51,770
You know,
and that's where it's going to be.

3023
02:03:51,771 --> 02:03:52,970
It's not going to be.
This is my,

3024
02:03:53,450 --> 02:03:55,670
for what it's worth.
I put this along with my big pussy

3025
02:03:55,671 --> 02:03:58,250
theory,
but it's not going to be the North

3026
02:03:58,250 --> 02:03:58,461
Koreans,
you know,

3027
02:03:58,461 --> 02:04:01,390
firing off a missile or whatever it's
gonna be this idea.

3028
02:04:01,391 --> 02:04:03,560
It's gonna be a pandemic.
Something that we didn't quite see

3029
02:04:03,561 --> 02:04:07,490
coming mutation of a,
of a disease or something that because I

3030
02:04:07,491 --> 02:04:10,940
do believe in the idea that nature takes
care of its own eventually,

3031
02:04:10,970 --> 02:04:12,890
you know,
just like a deer herd or whatever.

3032
02:04:12,990 --> 02:04:17,990
And eventually the overpopulation issue
becomes a concern and that's how the

3033
02:04:18,801 --> 02:04:21,370
earth tends to reset itself.
You know,

3034
02:04:21,380 --> 02:04:23,060
that is always how it works.
Yeah.

3035
02:04:23,780 --> 02:04:26,300
That would suck.
But another reason to be in Idaho,

3036
02:04:26,810 --> 02:04:31,550
bubonic plague and they have three human
cases in New Mexico that article said,

3037
02:04:31,880 --> 02:04:34,130
and then they found it in fleas in
Arizona.

3038
02:04:36,030 --> 02:04:38,250
Yeah.
Well everybody goes to your doctor.

3039
02:04:38,520 --> 02:04:41,820
Well survive the winter.
So Idaho,

3040
02:04:42,030 --> 02:04:43,430
what else has been going on?
What else?

3041
02:04:43,440 --> 02:04:46,740
You tell me
the inside track.

3042
02:04:46,741 --> 02:04:48,150
Yeah,
well there is that a man with a suit

3043
02:04:48,151 --> 02:04:50,270
coat on.
I know I get that and what?

3044
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:52,260
What I have in here also as a pocket
square,

3045
02:04:53,340 --> 02:04:55,050
I can pull it up.
I pulled that out when I do a TV

3046
02:04:55,051 --> 02:04:57,210
interview,
I pulled up a pocket square and just to

3047
02:04:57,211 --> 02:04:59,970
get a little classier way how people
tend to think you know what you're

3048
02:04:59,971 --> 02:05:01,560
talking about when you have a Hanky.

3049
02:05:01,680 --> 02:05:05,090
I've learned that from a Guy Ritchie
explained the pocket square to me.

3050
02:05:05,430 --> 02:05:06,600
Yeah,
he schooled me in it,

3051
02:05:07,400 --> 02:05:09,720
so it's not something that I was working
on and developing.

3052
02:05:09,721 --> 02:05:11,790
This is his theory,
his theory,

3053
02:05:11,791 --> 02:05:16,791
but he is a very well educated and very
well thought out in regards to his

3054
02:05:19,471 --> 02:05:22,570
choice of suits and a man wearing a well
tailored suit.

3055
02:05:22,571 --> 02:05:24,390
Tim,
is he still married to Madonna?

3056
02:05:24,760 --> 02:05:27,550
We got rid of the check a long time ago.
I remember,

3057
02:05:27,551 --> 02:05:29,520
but he had a kid with her.
Oh,

3058
02:05:30,060 --> 02:05:31,080
there you go.
Yeah.

3059
02:05:31,410 --> 02:05:33,870
I remember Madonna as soon as she
started seeing Guy Richie.

3060
02:05:33,871 --> 02:05:38,871
I was living in England at the time and
she just suddenly out of nowhere had a

3061
02:05:39,870 --> 02:05:40,980
British accent.
I love it,

3062
02:05:41,010 --> 02:05:41,750
love it.
People do.

3063
02:05:41,750 --> 02:05:43,740
That's fantastic.
I love that.

3064
02:05:43,800 --> 02:05:46,590
I love when white people talk like black
people.

3065
02:05:46,650 --> 02:05:47,570
I love.
Um,

3066
02:05:47,920 --> 02:05:51,600
it's my favorite or a Chinese guy
talking like black guy that's even

3067
02:05:51,601 --> 02:05:52,434
better.

3068
02:05:52,680 --> 02:05:54,590
Chinese guy now.
I what?

3069
02:05:54,600 --> 02:05:55,800
Have you heard that?
I've seen it.

3070
02:05:55,860 --> 02:06:00,860
I've seen it many times.
I'm a big fan of a trans racial,

3071
02:06:01,860 --> 02:06:04,500
like people that think they're the wrong
race.

3072
02:06:04,530 --> 02:06:05,730
Yes.
That's a new thing.

3073
02:06:05,760 --> 02:06:09,390
It's one of the few trans things you can
mock still.

3074
02:06:09,420 --> 02:06:10,770
Can you mock it?
Yes.

3075
02:06:10,810 --> 02:06:13,230
Okay.
Letting it go.

3076
02:06:13,710 --> 02:06:14,960
He said.
Well that'd be,

3077
02:06:14,980 --> 02:06:19,890
that would be Rachel Dolezal,
the Naacp in spokane.

3078
02:06:20,010 --> 02:06:23,010
That's right.
And the identified with Shaun King.

3079
02:06:23,940 --> 02:06:24,870
Yeah,
he's another one,

3080
02:06:24,900 --> 02:06:26,800
but he denies it.
He says that,

3081
02:06:26,801 --> 02:06:27,720
uh,
it's actually,

3082
02:06:28,140 --> 02:06:30,720
it's all that everyone is wrong.
His Mom,

3083
02:06:30,721 --> 02:06:33,540
his dad,
his birth certificate people,

3084
02:06:33,541 --> 02:06:35,240
he knows,
they all lied to them.

3085
02:06:35,540 --> 02:06:37,620
Uh,
they're line everybody else and only he

3086
02:06:37,621 --> 02:06:40,140
knows.
Oh well it says his mom had an affair

3087
02:06:40,141 --> 02:06:42,110
with a light skin black man or
something.

3088
02:06:42,160 --> 02:06:43,830
Somebody who knows.
Exactly.

3089
02:06:43,890 --> 02:06:45,360
Exactly.
It's just I can't,

3090
02:06:47,250 --> 02:06:50,940
I can't find enough energy given
everything else that's going to be

3091
02:06:50,941 --> 02:06:53,220
offended by very much frankly.

3092
02:06:53,220 --> 02:06:55,590
I just don't get.
I like people to live their own lives.

3093
02:06:55,591 --> 02:06:57,930
If you are happy,
God bless you.

3094
02:06:57,940 --> 02:07:01,230
Just be happy.
I'm way more amused that I am ever

3095
02:07:01,231 --> 02:07:03,360
offended by things like that.
I'm amused.

3096
02:07:03,450 --> 02:07:04,650
That's a good way to put it.
Yeah,

3097
02:07:04,740 --> 02:07:06,210
that's a good way.
That's a good way to say it.

3098
02:07:06,211 --> 02:07:08,340
You're more amusing than offended.
I just.

3099
02:07:08,720 --> 02:07:12,090
Do you know Rachel Dolezal the trick
from spokane because she,

3100
02:07:12,160 --> 02:07:14,040
uh,
got in trouble,

3101
02:07:14,700 --> 02:07:16,110
you know,
because everyone's mad at her.

3102
02:07:16,170 --> 02:07:21,170
She changed her name legally to the
blackest name the world has ever known

3103
02:07:23,830 --> 02:07:25,310
with young Jamie.
Pull it up.

3104
02:07:25,311 --> 02:07:26,370
Pull that name up.
W.

3105
02:07:26,490 --> 02:07:30,120
This is a,
it's a wonderful name and I would

3106
02:07:30,121 --> 02:07:32,850
encourage anyone that wants to be
transformational to do the game.

3107
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:33,900
The same thing.
AndK ,

3108
02:07:34,590 --> 02:07:37,960
e,
c h I a.

3109
02:07:37,961 --> 02:07:41,100
I don't know how you say that.
The catchy a marree.

3110
02:07:41,300 --> 02:07:43,870
Dr. Lo,
that's her new name.

3111
02:07:44,170 --> 02:07:45,640
Ready?
Here we go again.

3112
02:07:45,820 --> 02:07:50,820
Nick catchy a marree.
D'Angelo d I a l l O hm.

3113
02:07:54,370 --> 02:07:56,110
I liked the description that they give
her.

3114
02:07:56,350 --> 02:07:59,210
She's a former civil rights activist.
Enough.

3115
02:07:59,310 --> 02:07:59,741
Oh,
well,

3116
02:07:59,741 --> 02:08:03,160
I guess because she was fired,
but former Afrikanas studies instructor.

3117
02:08:03,161 --> 02:08:05,980
What's Afrikaana?
She decided to give up the civil rights

3118
02:08:05,981 --> 02:08:08,050
activist thing.
Hm.

3119
02:08:08,190 --> 02:08:09,460
Yeah.
Silly goose.

3120
02:08:09,730 --> 02:08:11,620
But it was great when she had like a
fro,

3121
02:08:11,650 --> 02:08:14,340
like look at her over there with that.
Yeah.

3122
02:08:14,610 --> 02:08:18,400
Full white family orange.
Spray Tan from Lincoln County,

3123
02:08:18,401 --> 02:08:20,500
Montana.
Little Ruth Ann's girl.

3124
02:08:21,310 --> 02:08:24,790
But she feels like she identifies with
black people more.

3125
02:08:24,791 --> 02:08:28,990
She likes the culture more and you know,
there's always been people that like the

3126
02:08:28,991 --> 02:08:32,560
culture more and talk less.
Sure that they're a part of the culture.

3127
02:08:32,561 --> 02:08:34,510
You don't,
you don't say you are.

3128
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:36,110
Yeah.
That's the new thing though,

3129
02:08:36,160 --> 02:08:37,510
isn't that a love of creating and
aren't.

3130
02:08:37,510 --> 02:08:39,970
They aren't the people that are offended
by the idea of appropriating.

3131
02:08:39,971 --> 02:08:43,590
Like if I opened a Mexican restaurant,
people would be offended because I

3132
02:08:43,600 --> 02:08:44,770
shouldn't do that.
I should just,

3133
02:08:45,280 --> 02:08:46,020
uh,
you know,

3134
02:08:46,020 --> 02:08:49,600
and I know you do.
I know black people that were furious at

3135
02:08:49,601 --> 02:08:52,900
her and I know other people that are
also black that were laughing

3136
02:08:52,901 --> 02:08:55,420
hysterically at it.
They thought it was what it was.

3137
02:08:55,450 --> 02:08:58,780
I think it really doesn't affect you.
It's preposterous and not only that,

3138
02:08:58,990 --> 02:09:01,540
don't be infuriated by the fact that she
got caught.

3139
02:09:01,750 --> 02:09:05,830
I mean she's,
I mean this is not like having any undue

3140
02:09:05,831 --> 02:09:07,630
influence.
This is all ridiculous.

3141
02:09:07,690 --> 02:09:08,231
No,
exactly.

3142
02:09:08,231 --> 02:09:10,480
And that.
And also again,

3143
02:09:10,481 --> 02:09:13,240
it's this idea that people are walking
around looking for reasons to be

3144
02:09:13,241 --> 02:09:13,800
offended.
Yeah.

3145
02:09:13,800 --> 02:09:16,720
And it just seems exhausting.
It's like everything.

3146
02:09:16,790 --> 02:09:18,850
And so I don't,
I don't know how people do it.

3147
02:09:18,850 --> 02:09:22,270
I don't know why they do it.
Maybe they just don't have enough going

3148
02:09:22,271 --> 02:09:24,880
on in their lives,
have enough objectivity and they get

3149
02:09:24,881 --> 02:09:28,150
caught up in the momentum of being
pissed off about something,

3150
02:09:28,660 --> 02:09:32,110
but the cultural appropriation or
pretending you're something like,

3151
02:09:32,170 --> 02:09:34,810
look at how many fucking people pretend
they're native American because it makes

3152
02:09:34,811 --> 02:09:36,700
them seem more spiritual.
Jesus,

3153
02:09:36,701 --> 02:09:37,850
that's always been an issue.
Yeah.

3154
02:09:38,040 --> 02:09:38,873
Yeah,
there is.

3155
02:09:39,520 --> 02:09:40,930
Elizabeth,
why was just trying to remember her

3156
02:09:40,931 --> 02:09:42,790
name?
Is she gonna I wonder if she's going to

3157
02:09:42,791 --> 02:09:43,624
run in 20,
20.

3158
02:09:43,730 --> 02:09:45,170
It's going to be a problem.
Yeah.

3159
02:09:45,320 --> 02:09:48,910
The allied and said you were part native
American to get some sort of

3160
02:09:49,030 --> 02:09:50,130
scholarship.
That's right.

3161
02:09:50,140 --> 02:09:51,200
Harvard,
wasn't it?

3162
02:09:51,520 --> 02:09:52,870
Oh,
look at that.

3163
02:09:53,310 --> 02:09:55,210
Yeah.
I will say this.

3164
02:09:55,350 --> 02:09:58,230
The world is so funny.
After a,

3165
02:09:58,990 --> 02:09:59,751
when,
when,

3166
02:09:59,751 --> 02:10:01,930
uh,
when we went into Iraq in 2003,

3167
02:10:01,970 --> 02:10:03,940
early 2003,
um,

3168
02:10:05,200 --> 02:10:08,650
people started looking at the business
opportunities that rock.

3169
02:10:08,650 --> 02:10:10,480
Right.
And I remember there was that whole

3170
02:10:11,500 --> 02:10:12,340
idea,
excuse me,

3171
02:10:12,341 --> 02:10:16,990
that there was gonna be all sorts of
business opening up in Iraq because I

3172
02:10:16,991 --> 02:10:18,910
don't know why they were thinking.
But um,

3173
02:10:19,270 --> 02:10:22,660
so then it became people looking for
contracts,

3174
02:10:22,690 --> 02:10:25,240
government contracts,
commercial sector contracts to do

3175
02:10:25,241 --> 02:10:28,480
business in Iraq.
And so the idea was suddenly there was a

3176
02:10:28,481 --> 02:10:33,481
mad rush to open up a minority owned and
veteran owned and

3177
02:10:37,140 --> 02:10:41,640
women owned businesses.
So the idea was if you had a,

3178
02:10:42,380 --> 02:10:44,160
like an annual Indian,
you know,

3179
02:10:44,210 --> 02:10:48,500
Eskimo who was supposedly in charge of
your business that gave you extra points

3180
02:10:48,501 --> 02:10:51,680
when you were weighed in the bid for a
contract that you were going for.

3181
02:10:51,980 --> 02:10:54,160
So there became this cottage industry,
you know,

3182
02:10:54,170 --> 02:10:58,550
much like the casino business of trying
to find tribes that you can represent in

3183
02:10:58,551 --> 02:11:02,960
order for them to end to open up a and
you're creating essentially a tribe to

3184
02:11:03,170 --> 02:11:04,100
have a casino.

3185
02:11:04,620 --> 02:11:06,580
It gives them a certain advantages
which.

3186
02:11:06,830 --> 02:11:07,940
So it's,
it's an interesting,

3187
02:11:07,941 --> 02:11:11,280
it's an interesting world we live in.
Well the native American casino business

3188
02:11:11,281 --> 02:11:15,740
is very weird in that regard and also
that a lot of people in these areas,

3189
02:11:15,741 --> 02:11:19,700
because there are certain percentage and
I think it's as little as one slash 16th

3190
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,400
native American,
you can get a check.

3191
02:11:22,820 --> 02:11:25,640
So like if,
if the casinos raking in the cash,

3192
02:11:25,730 --> 02:11:29,030
the people that are a part of that tribe
all get free money.

3193
02:11:29,080 --> 02:11:31,340
Yeah.
So these casinos are just generating

3194
02:11:31,341 --> 02:11:34,820
like fucking billions of dollars a year
that just because someone,

3195
02:11:34,830 --> 02:11:36,420
some of them require,
some of them are cow,

3196
02:11:36,421 --> 02:11:37,100
you know,
marginal.

3197
02:11:37,100 --> 02:11:37,960
But,
but uh,

3198
02:11:37,970 --> 02:11:39,370
you know,
there are a number of them that do,

3199
02:11:39,400 --> 02:11:40,750
do very well.
And you know,

3200
02:11:40,760 --> 02:11:42,650
wasn't for some of these.
I don't know about you,

3201
02:11:42,651 --> 02:11:44,720
but some of the.
I tell you what,

3202
02:11:44,750 --> 02:11:47,720
I want to be depressed,
go to,

3203
02:11:47,810 --> 02:11:49,940
you know,
there's certain Indian reservations in

3204
02:11:49,941 --> 02:11:51,680
this country that are just awful.

3205
02:11:51,830 --> 02:11:53,150
Oh my God,
I love her.

3206
02:11:53,151 --> 02:11:56,060
Poverty is just alcoholism down and,
and.

3207
02:11:56,061 --> 02:11:56,670
Yeah,
exactly.

3208
02:11:56,670 --> 02:12:00,620
Substance Abuse and lack of opportunity,
lack of educational facilities for the

3209
02:12:00,621 --> 02:12:04,240
kids and that's just not,
that's not right.

3210
02:12:04,650 --> 02:12:07,550
We should do.
We should be far better than that.

3211
02:12:07,580 --> 02:12:12,580
There should not be a native American
foundations are very strange when you

3212
02:12:13,131 --> 02:12:16,610
think about like how long ago it was,
these tribes,

3213
02:12:16,611 --> 02:12:21,611
people were roaming the earth and
nomadic fashion and living the life they

3214
02:12:22,011 --> 02:12:27,011
did before the Europeans came and that
now they've become this segmented part

3215
02:12:27,351 --> 02:12:31,700
of our population that's sort of a part
of America but has their own kind of

3216
02:12:31,701 --> 02:12:36,701
like nation inside of a nation.
And it was weird rules like the way they

3217
02:12:36,951 --> 02:12:39,320
have it up in Canada,
they call them first nation people,

3218
02:12:39,650 --> 02:12:43,400
but in candidates real weird in regards
to wildlife,

3219
02:12:43,640 --> 02:12:45,200
like I don't know if you know how it
works up there,

3220
02:12:45,201 --> 02:12:49,010
but they can shoot anything they want
all year round and they have it that way

3221
02:12:49,011 --> 02:12:52,880
in Washington state as well with elk
hunt elk all year round.

3222
02:12:53,060 --> 02:12:55,340
The rules are so different things the
same way.

3223
02:12:55,360 --> 02:13:00,290
They use spotlights for Moose.
So like they drive at night with four by

3224
02:13:00,291 --> 02:13:02,630
fours.
The Moose see the spotlight,

3225
02:13:02,631 --> 02:13:04,490
they freeze,
they belong away with high powered

3226
02:13:04,491 --> 02:13:08,280
rifles and they can kill him as many as
they want all year round the same.

3227
02:13:08,390 --> 02:13:12,230
If we used to go spotlighting kangaroos.
I lived in Australia when I was younger,

3228
02:13:12,260 --> 02:13:16,280
were stationed in England,
Australia.

3229
02:13:16,850 --> 02:13:19,480
I've lived in a lot of places,
but I'm now in my.

3230
02:13:19,570 --> 02:13:21,620
I'm in my last place now.
Idaho.

3231
02:13:21,690 --> 02:13:22,940
I'm not,
I've never moved.

3232
02:13:23,180 --> 02:13:25,800
But um,
yeah we used to go in Australia,

3233
02:13:26,180 --> 02:13:28,310
worked on,
lived on a sheep station out there,

3234
02:13:28,610 --> 02:13:33,120
massive property and we get into the,
of the truck with the spotlights.

3235
02:13:33,121 --> 02:13:36,150
And you go out and those kangaroos are
hard as shit to hit.

3236
02:13:36,330 --> 02:13:37,680
They are tough.
Haunting.

3237
02:13:37,710 --> 02:13:39,450
No.
You guys doing that for population

3238
02:13:39,451 --> 02:13:40,284
control?

3239
02:13:40,320 --> 02:13:41,860
Many of them,
yeah.

3240
02:13:42,430 --> 02:13:43,051
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

3241
02:13:43,051 --> 02:13:44,630
I mean this would be delicious.
You know,

3242
02:13:44,740 --> 02:13:46,120
it can be,
you know,

3243
02:13:46,140 --> 02:13:48,650
depending on how old they are and which
high.

3244
02:13:48,760 --> 02:13:49,960
But um,
the uh,

3245
02:13:50,250 --> 02:13:53,460
the tail is actually the tastiest part.
Why Kangaroo tail?

3246
02:13:53,500 --> 02:13:54,110
Yeah.
Yeah.

3247
02:13:54,110 --> 02:13:56,070
I don't know about all that,
but no,

3248
02:13:56,071 --> 02:13:58,590
I don't mean the ass.
I mean the tail tail because it

3249
02:13:58,591 --> 02:14:02,970
balances.
So I've seen the idea you go in real

3250
02:14:02,971 --> 02:14:03,721
life.
Yeah.

3251
02:14:03,721 --> 02:14:04,441
So,
but anyway,

3252
02:14:04,441 --> 02:14:06,630
they are hard to hit.
They are completely unpredictable in

3253
02:14:06,631 --> 02:14:10,380
their movement and they just uh,
and they move fast and they,

3254
02:14:10,381 --> 02:14:12,210
uh,
they jump the fences,

3255
02:14:12,211 --> 02:14:13,830
they can clear.
It's impressive.

3256
02:14:14,480 --> 02:14:18,990
I know why I'm talking about,
we played a video inviting these massive

3257
02:14:18,991 --> 02:14:21,090
herds or packs or whatever you call
them,

3258
02:14:21,091 --> 02:14:24,600
of kangaroos roaming across the field.
Like some people have no idea what the

3259
02:14:24,601 --> 02:14:25,700
numbers are.
You know,

3260
02:14:25,740 --> 02:14:28,260
I have friends that live in Australia
and they tell me like there's places

3261
02:14:28,261 --> 02:14:30,440
that are just infested and there's
nothing they can do.

3262
02:14:30,460 --> 02:14:31,730
They don't know what to do.
So they,

3263
02:14:31,780 --> 02:14:34,590
they literally have to gun them down
because there's no predators.

3264
02:14:34,640 --> 02:14:35,640
It is.
Yeah,

3265
02:14:35,641 --> 02:14:37,770
that's exactly right.
I mean when he got dingoes not going to

3266
02:14:37,771 --> 02:14:38,990
bring down a,
you know,

3267
02:14:39,030 --> 02:14:40,500
a,
a kangaroo,

3268
02:14:40,740 --> 02:14:42,100
good luck.
Feral cat and you know,

3269
02:14:42,330 --> 02:14:43,940
I mean,
but it's.

3270
02:14:43,950 --> 02:14:44,783
Yeah.
So this,

3271
02:14:45,170 --> 02:14:46,710
they just,
they're all over the place.

3272
02:14:46,780 --> 02:14:50,270
I'm great little animal.
So yeah,

3273
02:14:50,570 --> 02:14:52,270
they're kind of cute and they're tasty.
Know,

3274
02:14:52,280 --> 02:14:54,660
look at these fuckers go bouncing all
over the place.

3275
02:14:58,410 --> 02:15:01,850
A kangaroo call starts that Jesus
Christ.

3276
02:15:01,890 --> 02:15:04,800
So many of them.
And Oh,

3277
02:15:05,010 --> 02:15:07,350
people were upset.
I guess people were upset at the

3278
02:15:07,351 --> 02:15:11,450
kangaroo call was going to have that.
Well,

3279
02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:13,240
uh,
Ellen got stuck in a fence.

3280
02:15:13,350 --> 02:15:14,880
That's not good.
Yeah.

3281
02:15:14,881 --> 02:15:18,390
I mean whenever you have an animal that
doesn't have any sort of a natural

3282
02:15:18,391 --> 02:15:21,180
predator and they can just free free
ball it.

3283
02:15:21,240 --> 02:15:22,073
Exactly,
yeah.

3284
02:15:22,200 --> 02:15:23,970
That's what they,
they and Australia is such an

3285
02:15:23,971 --> 02:15:24,900
interesting place.
You know,

3286
02:15:24,901 --> 02:15:29,660
every time they introduce a species to
try to solve a problem that's pcs takes

3287
02:15:29,700 --> 02:15:30,301
off.
Yeah.

3288
02:15:30,301 --> 02:15:30,960
Yeah.
It just,

3289
02:15:30,960 --> 02:15:32,490
and it's,
it's never ending.

3290
02:15:32,700 --> 02:15:35,490
I was trying to explain to someone the
other day about the cats there.

3291
02:15:35,670 --> 02:15:36,421
Yeah.
That they,

3292
02:15:36,421 --> 02:15:39,630
they hunt cats like,
like what we think of as a pet.

3293
02:15:39,810 --> 02:15:41,010
And they were like,
why?

3294
02:15:41,630 --> 02:15:42,570
And I'm like,
listen,

3295
02:15:43,170 --> 02:15:47,940
I know it doesn't seem right,
but the feral cat population is just run

3296
02:15:47,941 --> 02:15:48,660
out of control.

3297
02:15:48,660 --> 02:15:53,240
Like we did a podcast once we pulled up
the feral cat population in America and

3298
02:15:53,250 --> 02:15:58,250
what it does that they killed billions
of birds and rodents in America.

3299
02:15:59,890 --> 02:16:00,990
Yeah.
And someone was like,

3300
02:16:01,050 --> 02:16:01,860
no,
that can't be right.

3301
02:16:01,860 --> 02:16:02,693
I'm like,
listen,

3302
02:16:02,790 --> 02:16:04,590
they,
the scientists who did the study of

3303
02:16:04,591 --> 02:16:07,650
shocked cats are fucking murderers.
Yeah.

3304
02:16:08,070 --> 02:16:10,740
And we had a cat,
a great cat named Charlie who's now

3305
02:16:10,741 --> 02:16:12,160
died.
Um,

3306
02:16:12,450 --> 02:16:15,030
but he was a,
he was not to a captain most part,

3307
02:16:15,031 --> 02:16:16,000
but he would,
uh,

3308
02:16:16,200 --> 02:16:21,200
he would kill chipmunks and he would lay
the chipmunks out in a row to get

3309
02:16:21,390 --> 02:16:22,223
offering.
Yeah.

3310
02:16:22,320 --> 02:16:24,570
Yeah.
And he was incredibly efficient.

3311
02:16:24,571 --> 02:16:25,920
We try to keep them indoors.
But you know,

3312
02:16:25,921 --> 02:16:27,450
the guy,
he just wanted to be outside killing

3313
02:16:27,451 --> 02:16:30,070
something,
so just fun time and then come in and

3314
02:16:30,071 --> 02:16:32,200
you open up a nice fresh can of cat food
for them.

3315
02:16:32,200 --> 02:16:34,720
Like thanks dad.
He's got a little bit of chip monck in

3316
02:16:34,721 --> 02:16:36,050
his tooth.
Uh,

3317
02:16:36,160 --> 02:16:37,330
yeah.
But the feral cats.

3318
02:16:37,331 --> 02:16:37,860
Yeah.
In,

3319
02:16:37,860 --> 02:16:38,310
uh,
in the,

3320
02:16:38,310 --> 02:16:39,101
in the ranch.
I mean,

3321
02:16:39,101 --> 02:16:41,650
you'd be out repairing fences or
something and yeah,

3322
02:16:41,680 --> 02:16:45,520
you just kinda get off or they'd spook
the horses or you'd get to put your hand

3323
02:16:45,521 --> 02:16:48,160
down to Pixar and Bob,
they just come out of nowhere and

3324
02:16:48,161 --> 02:16:49,870
they're just,
they're bastards.

3325
02:16:50,120 --> 02:16:51,580
Yeah.
They're not kitty,

3326
02:16:52,100 --> 02:16:53,680
kitty cats.
Hello Kitty.

3327
02:16:53,740 --> 02:16:56,260
Yeah,
they're like a wild small Predator

3328
02:16:56,261 --> 02:17:00,490
that's extremely vicious.
And you know,

3329
02:17:00,520 --> 02:17:05,320
they killed things all the time though.
The feral cat problem in the United

3330
02:17:05,320 --> 02:17:09,190
States is insignificant in comparison to
what it does in Australia though.

3331
02:17:09,400 --> 02:17:11,620
Australia,
they have devastated ground nesting

3332
02:17:11,621 --> 02:17:15,130
birds and all sorts of other species
because they're an invasive species and

3333
02:17:15,131 --> 02:17:15,791
there's nothing.
Again,

3334
02:17:15,791 --> 02:17:17,710
there's nothing really good dingoes
maybe,

3335
02:17:17,711 --> 02:17:19,510
but you know,
that's that then I can't get a

3336
02:17:19,511 --> 02:17:20,470
deputation is now.

3337
02:17:20,740 --> 02:17:22,720
So it didn't go it.
My baby,

3338
02:17:23,470 --> 02:17:25,780
where you live is fascinating because
you've got,

3339
02:17:25,810 --> 02:17:28,390
you've got everything up there,
you got grizzly bears.

3340
02:17:28,450 --> 02:17:29,201
Yeah.
You gotTa,

3341
02:17:29,201 --> 02:17:31,180
you gotta get a healthy grizzly
population.

3342
02:17:31,181 --> 02:17:34,450
I have a buddy who went black bear
hunting up there and they could not find

3343
02:17:34,451 --> 02:17:36,590
black bears.
They found board grizzlies.

3344
02:17:36,990 --> 02:17:39,400
Yeah.
They start grizzly after grizzly after

3345
02:17:39,401 --> 02:17:40,510
grizzly.
It's amazing.

3346
02:17:40,511 --> 02:17:41,021
I mean,
it is,

3347
02:17:41,021 --> 02:17:42,940
and it is,
it's such a good thing.

3348
02:17:43,030 --> 02:17:45,200
And when you see the sort of the health
of the,

3349
02:17:45,201 --> 02:17:48,460
of the wildlife population and just,
it makes you feel really good,

3350
02:17:48,461 --> 02:17:50,110
you know,
and it's,

3351
02:17:51,250 --> 02:17:52,450
you know,
it's hard to explain.

3352
02:17:52,451 --> 02:17:53,140
I mean,
people.

3353
02:17:53,140 --> 02:17:55,860
I was up in yellowstone and,
and uh,

3354
02:17:55,990 --> 02:17:59,110
once again,
I'm always amazed at how people interact

3355
02:17:59,111 --> 02:18:00,760
with wildlife when they're not used to
it.

3356
02:18:00,860 --> 02:18:02,590
Right?
And Yellowstone is probably the best

3357
02:18:02,591 --> 02:18:07,591
place to see that happen because there's
so many tourists during the busy time of

3358
02:18:08,141 --> 02:18:12,820
year and they'll just say there's no
regard for the fact that it's a wild

3359
02:18:12,821 --> 02:18:13,420
animal.

3360
02:18:13,420 --> 02:18:15,850
Right?
And even the Bison and the price will

3361
02:18:15,930 --> 02:18:19,600
kill you in a hot second if they get
pissed off and you'll get these

3362
02:18:19,601 --> 02:18:22,690
tourists,
it'll get out of that car and you know,

3363
02:18:22,691 --> 02:18:23,251
and,
and,

3364
02:18:23,251 --> 02:18:24,850
uh,
the husband will be taking a picture and

3365
02:18:24,851 --> 02:18:26,140
telling his wife to get a little bit
closer,

3366
02:18:26,180 --> 02:18:28,330
get closer right now.
Maybe he's doing it deliberately,

3367
02:18:28,331 --> 02:18:28,790
right?
But,

3368
02:18:28,790 --> 02:18:30,500
uh,
but it's,

3369
02:18:30,510 --> 02:18:32,400
it's an amazing thing.
Hey,

3370
02:18:32,640 --> 02:18:34,750
she looks fine and,
uh,

3371
02:18:34,780 --> 02:18:35,920
but it is,
it's an amazing.

3372
02:18:35,921 --> 02:18:38,890
That's another place for people if they,
if they haven't been to yellowstone,

3373
02:18:38,891 --> 02:18:42,370
go to yellowstone.
What seems like a zoo to people,

3374
02:18:42,430 --> 02:18:43,750
you know,
you see these gigantic,

3375
02:18:43,751 --> 02:18:46,570
furry star wars looking things out
there.

3376
02:18:46,630 --> 02:18:48,340
I mean,
that's what a buffalo it looks like when

3377
02:18:48,341 --> 02:18:50,640
you see it real life.
Is that real?

3378
02:18:50,680 --> 02:18:52,240
Yeah.
So they're so big.

3379
02:18:52,450 --> 02:18:53,440
They are,
they have massive.

3380
02:18:53,441 --> 02:18:57,100
And then we were in,
we were there and at one point was,

3381
02:18:57,340 --> 02:19:01,840
it was getting to be twilight and um,
came around a corner and I was with a

3382
02:19:01,900 --> 02:19:04,760
couple of the rangers and,
and uh,

3383
02:19:06,310 --> 02:19:09,040
there was a vehicle stopped.
It was a,

3384
02:19:09,100 --> 02:19:10,240
what do they call it?
A minivan.

3385
02:19:10,540 --> 02:19:14,410
And it was stopped on the side of the
road and there were half a dozen people

3386
02:19:14,411 --> 02:19:17,470
out of this minivan and they work all
kinds of fussing about,

3387
02:19:17,530 --> 02:19:20,470
you know,
and it just a little bit in the field

3388
02:19:20,560 --> 02:19:24,220
they're on the side and think what are
they doing?

3389
02:19:24,340 --> 02:19:27,170
And then it became clear that there was
little calf out there.

3390
02:19:27,200 --> 02:19:28,033
Oh,
little

3391
02:19:28,140 --> 02:19:31,040
license calf.
It was gotten separated from the herd

3392
02:19:31,550 --> 02:19:33,920
and I guess they had seen it,
but it now you could hear it.

3393
02:19:33,921 --> 02:19:35,200
It was kinda over there bleeding.
And,

3394
02:19:35,201 --> 02:19:36,260
and,
and,

3395
02:19:36,261 --> 02:19:37,940
uh,
they wanted to get it.

3396
02:19:37,941 --> 02:19:39,260
They wanted to wrap it up.
Meaning bleeding.

3397
02:19:39,300 --> 02:19:40,400
Yeah.
They make noise.

3398
02:19:40,520 --> 02:19:40,941
Yeah,
yeah,

3399
02:19:40,941 --> 02:19:41,331
yeah.
Not,

3400
02:19:41,331 --> 02:19:42,920
not bleeding.
Um,

3401
02:19:42,950 --> 02:19:44,960
although that,
that was probably the next step in this

3402
02:19:45,710 --> 02:19:47,360
evolution,
um,

3403
02:19:47,420 --> 02:19:48,740
was uh,
they were,

3404
02:19:48,770 --> 02:19:52,290
they were trying to figure out how to
round it up and get it back to its.

3405
02:19:53,810 --> 02:19:54,820
And the Rangers,
you know,

3406
02:19:54,830 --> 02:19:55,663
said,
okay,

3407
02:19:55,850 --> 02:19:56,720
here we go again.
And,

3408
02:19:57,120 --> 02:19:58,130
and they said,
look,

3409
02:19:58,131 --> 02:20:01,040
this happens.
Unfortunately people don't realize it's

3410
02:20:01,041 --> 02:20:02,450
nature.
So they had to get out.

3411
02:20:02,451 --> 02:20:05,000
And I stood there and listened while
they explain these people,

3412
02:20:05,001 --> 02:20:07,880
look,
this calf is somebody's dinner now,

3413
02:20:08,120 --> 02:20:09,290
you know,
it's going to be,

3414
02:20:09,400 --> 02:20:13,370
you know,
found and devoured by other forces of

3415
02:20:13,371 --> 02:20:14,010
nature out.

3416
02:20:14,010 --> 02:20:15,170
Luckily wolves.
Yeah.

3417
02:20:15,230 --> 02:20:17,690
And uh,
and there's a wolf population is coming

3418
02:20:17,691 --> 02:20:18,890
back up there,
which is great.

3419
02:20:19,310 --> 02:20:21,530
And so these people were horrified.
They were,

3420
02:20:21,560 --> 02:20:23,660
they were amazed at the rangers wouldn't
do something like,

3421
02:20:23,690 --> 02:20:27,500
I guess catch the calf,
put it in the back of the truck and

3422
02:20:27,501 --> 02:20:30,110
drive it to the ticket to the zoo,
take it to the zoo or take it to the

3423
02:20:30,111 --> 02:20:33,470
herd or take it home and bottle feed it.
It's not much you can do.

3424
02:20:33,471 --> 02:20:35,540
And most likely if it's mother left it
behind,

3425
02:20:35,541 --> 02:20:38,000
maybe there's something wrong with the
mother as well.

3426
02:20:38,760 --> 02:20:39,360
Yeah.
Yeah.

3427
02:20:39,360 --> 02:20:40,290
I mean,
who knows what the,

3428
02:20:40,310 --> 02:20:41,990
what the reasoning was behind it.
But it was,

3429
02:20:42,230 --> 02:20:43,850
it was interesting.
It was a good lesson.

3430
02:20:44,840 --> 02:20:47,480
But that place is that the park system
anyway,

3431
02:20:47,510 --> 02:20:51,080
I think we've talked about that before.
It's just astounding in this amazing.

3432
02:20:51,110 --> 02:20:51,710
Oh my God.

3433
02:20:51,710 --> 02:20:53,100
Yeah.
And the natural,

3434
02:20:53,101 --> 02:20:53,790
uh,
the,

3435
02:20:53,790 --> 02:20:56,050
the uh,
rather the national parks that,

3436
02:20:56,051 --> 02:20:57,140
uh,
that we have,

3437
02:20:57,220 --> 02:20:57,710
uh,
in,

3438
02:20:57,710 --> 02:21:00,570
in Idaho in particular,
you guys have a lot of public ally

3439
02:21:00,730 --> 02:21:01,600
wilderness,
uh,

3440
02:21:01,610 --> 02:21:02,780
you know,
into the Frank Church.

3441
02:21:02,781 --> 02:21:06,130
Wildernesses insane the size.
Um,

3442
02:21:06,230 --> 02:21:09,920
I've read a really good book called the
big burn if anybody's looking for a book

3443
02:21:09,921 --> 02:21:14,540
to pick up and read,
it's about this massive forest fire that

3444
02:21:14,541 --> 02:21:18,350
took place mostly in Idaho and it was,
um,

3445
02:21:18,890 --> 02:21:20,630
during the course of,
uh,

3446
02:21:20,840 --> 02:21:23,130
of Teddy Roosevelt's time.
And it also,

3447
02:21:23,180 --> 02:21:25,380
it also covers Teddy Roosevelt,
um,

3448
02:21:25,940 --> 02:21:30,940
and his efforts and the way that he got
turned on to conservation.

3449
02:21:31,850 --> 02:21:35,750
Um,
and the beginnings of the firefighting,

3450
02:21:35,890 --> 02:21:36,950
you know,
um,

3451
02:21:37,010 --> 02:21:42,010
profession a forest fires.
And it's a fascinating read.

3452
02:21:42,170 --> 02:21:42,921
I mean,
you think about it,

3453
02:21:42,921 --> 02:21:43,731
people are going to go,
really,

3454
02:21:43,731 --> 02:21:45,200
I'm going to read a book about a big
forest fire,

3455
02:21:45,380 --> 02:21:46,460
but it's,
it's incredible.

3456
02:21:46,460 --> 02:21:49,250
And they weave in the history and the
time of the administration and how they

3457
02:21:49,251 --> 02:21:53,720
were declaring parks and what they were
doing and how they tried to tackle this

3458
02:21:53,721 --> 02:21:56,500
fire and what that meant for future
conservation term.

3459
02:21:56,530 --> 02:21:57,260
And,
and it's,

3460
02:21:57,260 --> 02:21:58,610
it's,
it's a fascinating book,

3461
02:21:58,611 --> 02:22:01,040
so it's called the big burn.
I'm drawing a blank on who wrote it,

3462
02:22:01,430 --> 02:22:03,680
but if anybody's out there listening and
wants to book,

3463
02:22:03,740 --> 02:22:06,170
pick it up,
how did they try to stop a fire back

3464
02:22:06,171 --> 02:22:08,390
then?
Especially a massive wildfire,

3465
02:22:08,420 --> 02:22:10,670
you know,
doing a lot of the same things that they

3466
02:22:10,671 --> 02:22:11,620
do now,
right?

3467
02:22:11,630 --> 02:22:15,680
Cutting lines and breaks and trying to
deprive it of fuel,

3468
02:22:15,681 --> 02:22:18,210
feeding it back on itself.
Um,

3469
02:22:18,980 --> 02:22:19,880
it was,
uh,

3470
02:22:20,120 --> 02:22:25,050
just manpower,
just sheer manpower and trying to um,

3471
02:22:25,290 --> 02:22:26,130
and you know,
putting up

3472
02:22:26,140 --> 02:22:27,780
the smoke towers and,
and,

3473
02:22:27,781 --> 02:22:28,810
you know,
creating a,

3474
02:22:28,811 --> 02:22:32,130
back then that's what they were doing.
They were just out in the middle of

3475
02:22:32,131 --> 02:22:32,870
nowhere.
You try to,

3476
02:22:32,870 --> 02:22:34,970
you try to space out these,
these,

3477
02:22:34,971 --> 02:22:36,180
um,
outposts,

3478
02:22:36,181 --> 02:22:40,680
these little points on a top of the
mountains where you can identify smoke

3479
02:22:40,681 --> 02:22:42,390
and try to catch it.
You know,

3480
02:22:42,391 --> 02:22:44,370
like if you've got an electrical storm,
boom,

3481
02:22:44,371 --> 02:22:46,830
then all of a sudden you see some smoke
and you realize you probably got to

3482
02:22:46,831 --> 02:22:48,660
start a fire.
You want to get on it as quick as

3483
02:22:48,661 --> 02:22:50,730
possible.
So then nowadays you'll call and the

3484
02:22:50,731 --> 02:22:53,160
smoke jumpers and they'll go in and
that's an insane job,

3485
02:22:53,470 --> 02:22:55,590
um,
to try to contain it,

3486
02:22:55,591 --> 02:22:57,390
put it out,
but there's always been debate.

3487
02:22:57,450 --> 02:22:58,830
What do you do?
Do you let it burn,

3488
02:22:58,831 --> 02:23:00,000
do you,
how do you,

3489
02:23:00,390 --> 02:23:03,630
how do you deal with it?
Depends on the weather forecast as well.

3490
02:23:03,690 --> 02:23:08,170
Weather forecast and it,
part of it was politics and it was me

3491
02:23:08,220 --> 02:23:11,250
back then in Roosevelt's time,
it was all the timber barons,

3492
02:23:11,251 --> 02:23:13,410
right.
And the mining barons and the railroad

3493
02:23:13,411 --> 02:23:17,550
barons and you know,
they weren't interested in,

3494
02:23:17,551 --> 02:23:21,000
in Roosevelt's idea of claiming land for
the public.

3495
02:23:21,630 --> 02:23:23,280
Um,
and so,

3496
02:23:23,760 --> 02:23:24,440
you know,
it,

3497
02:23:24,440 --> 02:23:26,790
it was so fascinating.
It's a fascinating read.

3498
02:23:26,850 --> 02:23:28,710
And again,
sort of go back to that same thing that

3499
02:23:28,711 --> 02:23:30,660
we talked about it before,
how did this nation could cobbled

3500
02:23:30,661 --> 02:23:32,850
together and how did it end up looking
the way it looked?

3501
02:23:32,851 --> 02:23:35,490
And Roosevelt had some real vision.
He really did.

3502
02:23:35,491 --> 02:23:38,340
I mean,
we're so thankful we should be so

3503
02:23:38,341 --> 02:23:42,640
thankful because of that vision.
We have this incredible national park

3504
02:23:42,641 --> 02:23:46,140
system and all this public land.
I talked to a wildlife biologist who

3505
02:23:46,141 --> 02:23:50,340
said that that's one of the reasons why
we have all these issues with like bark

3506
02:23:50,341 --> 02:23:53,820
beetles and all these different,
a dead tree issues that when we get a

3507
02:23:53,821 --> 02:23:57,330
forest fire today,
it's like so out of control because we

3508
02:23:57,331 --> 02:24:01,560
don't allow these burns to take place,
which they do naturally in nature.

3509
02:24:01,620 --> 02:24:02,171
Right?
Yeah.

3510
02:24:02,171 --> 02:24:04,590
And that's part of it because you can
imagine what happens if you,

3511
02:24:05,040 --> 02:24:07,350
if,
if you don't do that,

3512
02:24:07,351 --> 02:24:09,990
you develop the fuel over a long period
of time,

3513
02:24:10,260 --> 02:24:12,150
uh,
and then you get a devastating fire.

3514
02:24:13,050 --> 02:24:15,240
And,
and also apparently the carbon from

3515
02:24:15,241 --> 02:24:17,490
those trees burning is actually good for
the ground.

3516
02:24:17,491 --> 02:24:19,260
The soil it didn't know it is,
it's very,

3517
02:24:19,261 --> 02:24:22,230
it's the ability of the land to bounce
back.

3518
02:24:22,810 --> 02:24:26,700
We see it in not all the time.
And you get up in Montana and in other

3519
02:24:26,701 --> 02:24:27,720
parts,
parts of Wyoming,

3520
02:24:27,721 --> 02:24:29,390
you see how quickly.
Yeah,

3521
02:24:29,400 --> 02:24:31,170
the environment can,
can bounce back.

3522
02:24:31,320 --> 02:24:35,100
And how often do you see like wolves and
grizzlies and stuff like that where you

3523
02:24:35,101 --> 02:24:38,880
are
wolves more than than grizzlies.

3524
02:24:38,881 --> 02:24:39,920
The grizzlies is still.
Yeah,

3525
02:24:39,930 --> 02:24:40,820
they'll still,
they,

3526
02:24:40,980 --> 02:24:42,930
you know,
they'll try to keep to themselves.

3527
02:24:43,160 --> 02:24:44,300
Um,
but,

3528
02:24:44,460 --> 02:24:45,840
but you're seeing a ton of elk.

3529
02:24:45,870 --> 02:24:47,040
Yeah.
More wolves.

3530
02:24:47,850 --> 02:24:49,680
We had a lot of.
Everybody's got coyotes,

3531
02:24:50,390 --> 02:24:53,490
so they're so resilient.
They are like the cockroach of the

3532
02:24:53,491 --> 02:24:54,630
Mammal,
you know?

3533
02:24:54,660 --> 02:24:55,980
Yeah,
they're pretty incredible.

3534
02:24:56,160 --> 02:24:57,470
Um,
but uh,

3535
02:24:57,480 --> 02:24:58,900
it's,
yeah,

3536
02:24:58,920 --> 02:25:01,000
it's uh,
I,

3537
02:25:01,380 --> 02:25:03,060
I'd say if,
if you're,

3538
02:25:04,190 --> 02:25:05,580
you know,
if you're looking at,

3539
02:25:05,660 --> 02:25:10,050
um,
an accessible trip and I get to ask this

3540
02:25:10,051 --> 02:25:10,890
all the time,
what would you do?

3541
02:25:10,891 --> 02:25:14,910
Where would you go if you had like two
weeks to take the kids and drive him

3542
02:25:14,911 --> 02:25:18,120
somewhere?
I would just point the car towards a

3543
02:25:18,210 --> 02:25:19,560
Utah,
Idaho,

3544
02:25:19,920 --> 02:25:21,450
Montana,
Wyoming and just,

3545
02:25:21,490 --> 02:25:23,950
yeah,
just head up there and then just see

3546
02:25:23,951 --> 02:25:24,940
what you can see.
You know,

3547
02:25:24,941 --> 02:25:28,690
you've got plenty of opportunity to,
a tremendous number of excellent parks

3548
02:25:29,200 --> 02:25:31,450
and you know,
show the kids something different.

3549
02:25:31,680 --> 02:25:34,440
Yeah.
Just let them understand these fats.

3550
02:25:34,510 --> 02:25:38,670
Vast swaths of land that it just open
wilderness.

3551
02:25:38,710 --> 02:25:40,800
Take the electronics away to give me
your.

3552
02:25:40,810 --> 02:25:41,321
I bet.
Yeah.

3553
02:25:41,321 --> 02:25:42,120
Oh yeah,
yeah.

3554
02:25:42,120 --> 02:25:44,740
Don't hide those in the trunk.
God,

3555
02:25:45,100 --> 02:25:46,510
we're starting to get the kids all
start.

3556
02:25:47,050 --> 02:25:50,590
I'll start school tomorrow and they know
as soon as the school year starts,

3557
02:25:50,591 --> 02:25:53,140
that's it.
They don't get as much electronics now.

3558
02:25:54,100 --> 02:25:54,970
Yeah,
no more.

3559
02:25:55,060 --> 02:25:56,380
I mean,
unless they have homework or something

3560
02:25:56,381 --> 02:25:58,920
like that,
it's just too easy to find like escape

3561
02:25:58,921 --> 02:26:03,921
in that from life and that life is
critical for young minds and even being

3562
02:26:04,391 --> 02:26:06,700
bored.
I was reading something about the power

3563
02:26:06,701 --> 02:26:11,260
of boredom and how important it is for
creativity that is kids today are kids

3564
02:26:11,261 --> 02:26:14,470
that are never bored.
They never have to think of something to

3565
02:26:14,471 --> 02:26:16,660
do.
They can always just look at their phone

3566
02:26:16,661 --> 02:26:20,740
or look at the TV and it never activates
that part of their brain where they're

3567
02:26:20,741 --> 02:26:22,930
searching and thinking.
That's really interesting.

3568
02:26:22,931 --> 02:26:23,980
I hadn't thought about that,
but you're right.

3569
02:26:23,980 --> 02:26:26,350
Because we tend to plan everything for
them.

3570
02:26:26,830 --> 02:26:28,720
Okay.
Now you got to go to your uh,

3571
02:26:28,750 --> 02:26:32,050
whatever your hockey lesson.
Go to Lacrosse,

3572
02:26:32,080 --> 02:26:34,480
now it's going to be baseball,
now you've got chess club or whatever

3573
02:26:34,481 --> 02:26:36,140
the hell you doing.
Um,

3574
02:26:36,490 --> 02:26:37,120
yeah,
you're right.

3575
02:26:37,120 --> 02:26:38,680
And,
and it's also kind of goes back to that

3576
02:26:38,681 --> 02:26:41,410
idea that we use to manage these things
for ourselves.

3577
02:26:41,450 --> 02:26:44,770
Right.
And so kids would go out and they would

3578
02:26:44,771 --> 02:26:47,530
organize their own teams and I worry
about that too.

3579
02:26:47,531 --> 02:26:49,030
I mean,
I like a God,

3580
02:26:49,031 --> 02:26:52,090
you know,
just the ability for kids to meet up at

3581
02:26:52,091 --> 02:26:53,440
a playground and say,
okay,

3582
02:26:53,441 --> 02:26:54,161
we're going to end,
you know,

3583
02:26:54,161 --> 02:26:55,960
maybe it happens and I'm making too much
of this,

3584
02:26:55,961 --> 02:26:59,320
but we can't have that because bobby
keeps getting picked last and it's

3585
02:26:59,321 --> 02:27:01,130
terrible for his self esteem.
Meanwhile,

3586
02:27:01,131 --> 02:27:04,300
at Bobby's going to become a software
coder that makes the ai that runs the

3587
02:27:04,301 --> 02:27:05,120
world.

3588
02:27:05,120 --> 02:27:06,250
That's right.
Now that's what happens,

3589
02:27:06,260 --> 02:27:07,220
right?
All the chickens get.

3590
02:27:07,420 --> 02:27:10,210
Bobby.
Bobby gets passed and bobby becomes mark

3591
02:27:10,211 --> 02:27:13,330
Zuckerberg or Elon Musk.
I just said chicks am my lead to say

3592
02:27:13,331 --> 02:27:15,090
chicks,
chicks,

3593
02:27:15,250 --> 02:27:16,051
chicks.
I was just like,

3594
02:27:16,051 --> 02:27:18,020
you can still mock transracial people.
Okay.

3595
02:27:18,430 --> 02:27:21,370
Games all the broads.
That's where it gets tricky.

3596
02:27:21,371 --> 02:27:22,930
All abroad,
you're going to want bobby.

3597
02:27:22,931 --> 02:27:24,910
They've coder broads a weird one,
isn't it?

3598
02:27:24,940 --> 02:27:26,620
Because they're not really that broad.
Yeah.

3599
02:27:26,650 --> 02:27:30,550
I caught that happen in dames.
We're not really private dix from the 19

3600
02:27:30,551 --> 02:27:32,920
thirties.
So I guess what Dane was.

3601
02:27:33,060 --> 02:27:34,450
Dane was I,
I don't know.

3602
02:27:34,451 --> 02:27:37,020
I think of the Maltese Falcon or
something like that.

3603
02:27:37,300 --> 02:27:38,780
Game a private.
No,

3604
02:27:38,800 --> 02:27:39,091
no,
no.

3605
02:27:39,091 --> 02:27:40,750
I mean,
I mean they would say they would say

3606
02:27:40,751 --> 02:27:42,430
yeah,
the dame know walked in.

3607
02:27:42,550 --> 02:27:45,640
My life changed,
but broads is a weird one because it's

3608
02:27:45,670 --> 02:27:48,990
fun to say because it's like a bunch of
guys.

3609
02:27:48,990 --> 02:27:51,030
It's fucking broad.
Broad.

3610
02:27:51,130 --> 02:27:53,950
I love the saying that I feel like I
should be smoking a cigarette.

3611
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,740
I'm saying bring a cigar for sure.
Yeah.

3612
02:27:56,800 --> 02:27:59,350
Martini.
There's not a whole lot of things that

3613
02:27:59,351 --> 02:28:01,450
chicks can say about us like that
though.

3614
02:28:01,480 --> 02:28:04,420
Like Bros.
It's sorta like how black people never

3615
02:28:04,421 --> 02:28:06,760
had a replacement word for the n word
for white people.

3616
02:28:06,940 --> 02:28:10,300
LIke honky just does not have any
negative impact.

3617
02:28:10,301 --> 02:28:13,630
It doesn't work,
but like it's a throwback.

3618
02:28:13,810 --> 02:28:16,990
It's a real historical throwback.
Honky doesn't work.

3619
02:28:17,020 --> 02:28:19,600
Remember the last time I heard anybody
she trashed like whatever.

3620
02:28:19,690 --> 02:28:20,570
That doesn't hurt.
Yeah.

3621
02:28:20,860 --> 02:28:25,100
But like broads is a funny derogatory
term for what women don't.

3622
02:28:25,101 --> 02:28:28,400
I guess burrows they have bros douche
bags.

3623
02:28:28,450 --> 02:28:29,211
Yeah.
That's probably,

3624
02:28:29,211 --> 02:28:30,590
that's probably what more more to the
point.

3625
02:28:30,660 --> 02:28:33,500
Frozen perspective.
White oriented though bros are always

3626
02:28:33,501 --> 02:28:36,110
white people.
He never say a bunch of bros and it's

3627
02:28:36,200 --> 02:28:36,980
black eyes.

3628
02:28:36,980 --> 02:28:39,620
I didn't know that.
I didn't know what jamie.

3629
02:28:40,320 --> 02:28:41,870
If you're younger,
you'd be a fuck boy.

3630
02:28:42,170 --> 02:28:43,250
Oh,
that's true.

3631
02:28:43,700 --> 02:28:45,380
That's called a fuckboy.
Right.

3632
02:28:45,381 --> 02:28:48,560
But that's a lot of people to like black
people.

3633
02:28:48,790 --> 02:28:50,810
Like that's ian edwards has that
hilarious bit.

3634
02:28:50,811 --> 02:28:52,190
It's a.
It's everywhere.

3635
02:28:52,191 --> 02:28:54,530
It's universal though.
It's across the board.

3636
02:28:54,590 --> 02:28:56,680
So we can all agree on fuckboy.
Yeah.

3637
02:28:57,010 --> 02:28:58,530
I don't know what that means.
I don't.

3638
02:28:58,531 --> 02:29:02,470
I don't mean like a derogatory term.
Okay.

3639
02:29:02,990 --> 02:29:03,823
Okay.
Yeah,

3640
02:29:03,870 --> 02:29:05,120
because I mean in some circles,
who knows?

3641
02:29:05,121 --> 02:29:06,540
Maybe that's a good thing.
I don't know.

3642
02:29:06,700 --> 02:29:09,370
Bright cougar wants to fuck.
Boy.

3643
02:29:10,900 --> 02:29:14,210
It's like speaking italian wrong.
I'm sure I'm not getting it right.

3644
02:29:14,350 --> 02:29:16,790
You got it right.
Because if you're in a situation where

3645
02:29:16,791 --> 02:29:20,420
you're like an old broad who's got a lot
of money and you want some young.

3646
02:29:20,421 --> 02:29:21,420
Fuck boy.
Yeah.

3647
02:29:21,540 --> 02:29:22,890
He wants a car,
right?

3648
02:29:23,040 --> 02:29:23,750
Yeah.

3649
02:29:23,750 --> 02:29:26,870
It's good man.
Going to fuck boy is not going to sell

3650
02:29:26,871 --> 02:29:28,820
for a prius.
You had some personal trainer at

3651
02:29:28,830 --> 02:29:30,170
kroger's.
Got to spend some cash.

3652
02:29:30,220 --> 02:29:31,400
Yeah.
She's got to get him a ferrari.

3653
02:29:31,730 --> 02:29:35,420
Sorta like how the guy who owned the uh,
was it the clippers,

3654
02:29:35,630 --> 02:29:36,860
that guy,
the old man.

3655
02:29:36,861 --> 02:29:38,570
What the fuck's his name?
Donald sterling.

3656
02:29:38,571 --> 02:29:40,280
Sterling memory had that broad.
He got her.

3657
02:29:40,490 --> 02:29:42,720
He had a broad right.
He did have a broad,

3658
02:29:43,740 --> 02:29:44,573
broad.
Yeah.

3659
02:29:44,750 --> 02:29:48,950
And he got her like a ferrari and a
bentley and bought her a condo.

3660
02:29:49,010 --> 02:29:50,660
But the broads used to work in the steno
pool.

3661
02:29:50,720 --> 02:29:51,320
Right.
I mean,

3662
02:29:51,320 --> 02:29:54,480
you know,
the ones in the steno pool and the

3663
02:29:54,481 --> 02:29:59,481
office environment back in the sixties.
I know for full.

3664
02:29:59,620 --> 02:30:00,830
Yeah,
because if you needed to apply,

3665
02:30:01,580 --> 02:30:02,360
you know,
you'd have to,

3666
02:30:02,360 --> 02:30:03,220
you'd have to get,
you know,

3667
02:30:03,260 --> 02:30:07,220
marge to come up from the steno pool and
she would take notes and then,

3668
02:30:07,500 --> 02:30:10,520
you know,
do the letter or whatever the paper and

3669
02:30:10,521 --> 02:30:12,980
you'd post it in the mail and that's how
you get business done.

3670
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:13,910
And that's aLert.
Whoa.

3671
02:30:13,911 --> 02:30:15,410
That's a standard thing.
You gotta look at that.

3672
02:30:16,380 --> 02:30:18,080
There's a lot of frauds.
And that steno pool.

3673
02:30:18,110 --> 02:30:19,460
If I was one of those [inaudible] I'd be
like,

3674
02:30:19,520 --> 02:30:21,940
I'd rather be a hooker.
I gotta take this.

3675
02:30:21,950 --> 02:30:25,640
Some dudes in there though,
probably not be a steno pool now.

3676
02:30:25,940 --> 02:30:27,260
Maybe just.
Oh,

3677
02:30:27,261 --> 02:30:29,390
okay.
Guys there,

3678
02:30:29,430 --> 02:30:31,250
they allowed them to work with women
back then.

3679
02:30:31,430 --> 02:30:33,380
I don't think so.
Hold on.

3680
02:30:33,410 --> 02:30:37,190
Steno pools to cubicles and back again.
Wow.

3681
02:30:37,400 --> 02:30:40,940
Fuck all that to you.
Learned about standup pools.

3682
02:30:40,941 --> 02:30:42,050
I learned about.
Fuck boys.

3683
02:30:42,460 --> 02:30:43,940
That's a trap.
And a half though,

3684
02:30:43,941 --> 02:30:45,650
isn't it?
Imagine working in a place like that.

3685
02:30:45,651 --> 02:30:46,300
I was like,
what?

3686
02:30:46,300 --> 02:30:49,040
Where are you going from here?
And the other one was the,

3687
02:30:49,041 --> 02:30:49,821
uh,
the,

3688
02:30:49,821 --> 02:30:52,760
uh,
the telephone command center.

3689
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:56,330
Can we take that picture up on the upper
top colored picture?

3690
02:30:56,331 --> 02:30:58,520
Look right there.
The one with the color in it.

3691
02:30:59,830 --> 02:31:02,420
No one with the girl holding up the
sign.

3692
02:31:02,490 --> 02:31:03,690
Oh,
look at that.

3693
02:31:04,370 --> 02:31:07,700
Swimming in the steno pool by lynn
peril.

3694
02:31:07,910 --> 02:31:12,050
Oh god.
A retro guy to make it in the office.

3695
02:31:12,080 --> 02:31:13,790
Fuck.
Look at that.

3696
02:31:13,791 --> 02:31:16,640
Big of that modern office equipment.
They're there in the lower left hand

3697
02:31:16,641 --> 02:31:20,250
corner.
Gives you a sense of the date of that

3698
02:31:20,251 --> 02:31:22,110
book.
No more writing with a crayon.

3699
02:31:22,350 --> 02:31:23,370
See,
nowadays,

3700
02:31:24,570 --> 02:31:27,690
a key office environment is much more
dangerous now.

3701
02:31:27,780 --> 02:31:31,500
I think it's much more fraught with
potential for hazards and landmines.

3702
02:31:31,710 --> 02:31:34,110
Look at that.
That recording device there.

3703
02:31:34,260 --> 02:31:35,730
Boy,
let me do that thing.

3704
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:39,150
See,
so he was talking and to transcribe all

3705
02:31:39,151 --> 02:31:39,990
that.
Is that what was going on?

3706
02:31:40,010 --> 02:31:43,140
Like a dictaphone?
What is with the guy with a bowler hat?

3707
02:31:43,200 --> 02:31:46,380
This is a movie which was like a spy or
something.

3708
02:31:46,381 --> 02:31:48,110
Oh yeah,
that's it.

3709
02:31:48,300 --> 02:31:50,070
Because you know,
we used to wear a dress like that.

3710
02:31:50,280 --> 02:31:51,810
I don't know if you could.
You can zoom in on that,

3711
02:31:51,811 --> 02:31:54,210
but that was actually.
We would get that after we completed

3712
02:31:54,211 --> 02:31:56,220
training,
they would actually give us an outfit

3713
02:31:56,221 --> 02:31:57,950
like that,
the entire weight,

3714
02:31:58,500 --> 02:32:00,390
the bowler hat and like,
that's nice.

3715
02:32:00,570 --> 02:32:02,880
And then we would set off on our
adventures lakes.

3716
02:32:02,881 --> 02:32:04,980
What's that new movie?
The kingsmen.

3717
02:32:05,040 --> 02:32:07,980
So what it is,
bunch of spies out there kicking ass.

3718
02:32:08,060 --> 02:32:10,170
I have not seen that.
Teaching you deadly skills.

3719
02:32:10,171 --> 02:32:13,620
Like how to kill people at upenn.
They would teach you life skills.

3720
02:32:13,621 --> 02:32:18,530
Like how to use regular
field expediency.

3721
02:32:18,531 --> 02:32:21,350
Yeah,
I mean it's like knowing how to fire for

3722
02:32:21,360 --> 02:32:22,920
whatever weapon you pick up off the
ground.

3723
02:32:22,980 --> 02:32:25,620
It's just simply knowing you know,
what,

3724
02:32:26,320 --> 02:32:29,070
what would work and most of it's common
sense,

3725
02:32:29,100 --> 02:32:31,140
right?
I mean in terms of what would actually

3726
02:32:31,830 --> 02:32:35,100
do the job,
but yeah,

3727
02:32:35,130 --> 02:32:36,030
I mean it's,
it's just,

3728
02:32:36,190 --> 02:32:38,970
it's just a field expediency,
which is good.

3729
02:32:39,020 --> 02:32:41,280
Was it in madison?
Practical information.

3730
02:32:41,520 --> 02:32:43,380
Be polite,
be professional,

3731
02:32:43,381 --> 02:32:47,970
and have a plan to kill everyone.
You meet madIson madison,

3732
02:32:48,320 --> 02:32:49,740
who?
I thought you were talking about.

3733
02:32:49,741 --> 02:32:51,300
John madison.
James madison.

3734
02:32:51,840 --> 02:32:53,220
Wow.
They were tough son of a bitches.

3735
02:32:53,221 --> 02:32:54,150
Be like then.
No.

3736
02:32:54,480 --> 02:32:55,370
So mad.
It's okay.

3737
02:32:55,380 --> 02:32:58,290
Mad dog mattis.
Love to say mad dog,

3738
02:32:58,291 --> 02:32:59,180
didn't he?
Yes.

3739
02:32:59,190 --> 02:33:02,160
He was absolutely in love with mad dog
with that name.

3740
02:33:02,190 --> 02:33:03,900
Well,
he liked it because he had his own life.

3741
02:33:03,901 --> 02:33:05,280
Hitman.
Yeah.

3742
02:33:05,490 --> 02:33:06,600
You know,
I don't know.

3743
02:33:06,601 --> 02:33:09,570
What do you think this is going?
Do you think he's in for four years and

3744
02:33:10,350 --> 02:33:12,540
not anymore polite.
Be professional,

3745
02:33:12,541 --> 02:33:15,180
but have a plan to kill everyone.
You meet madison.

3746
02:33:16,680 --> 02:33:19,080
that's the kind of guy you want in that
position.

3747
02:33:19,081 --> 02:33:21,750
You want to go with things like that and
anybody who doesn't understand that well

3748
02:33:21,810 --> 02:33:23,250
good.
I'm glad you're not in that position.

3749
02:33:23,251 --> 02:33:23,670
Yeah,
because.

3750
02:33:23,670 --> 02:33:25,800
And that goes back to Afghanistan.
We were talking about what's the end

3751
02:33:25,801 --> 02:33:27,360
game if you're going to do this,
don't let it,

3752
02:33:27,950 --> 02:33:28,980
let's not draw,
you know,

3753
02:33:28,981 --> 02:33:32,160
it kind of lets not do this thing where
we're dying by paper cuts or whatever

3754
02:33:32,161 --> 02:33:32,994
you wanna call it.
And I just.

3755
02:33:33,420 --> 02:33:35,970
And that's kind of where it's been.
I just feel like we've been in a Holding

3756
02:33:35,971 --> 02:33:40,890
pattern for years now when it comes to
Afghanistan without really knowing where

3757
02:33:40,891 --> 02:33:44,670
we're going or where we want to be when
we get to the end of that road.

3758
02:33:44,740 --> 02:33:47,730
And you know.
So if somebody like madison and people

3759
02:33:47,731 --> 02:33:50,310
in general in the military,
I understand if you're going to do

3760
02:33:50,311 --> 02:33:51,510
something,
you do it to win,

3761
02:33:51,511 --> 02:33:53,460
that's your objective.
And I worry that,

3762
02:33:53,490 --> 02:33:58,490
well maybe 40,000 troops is not exactly
doing it to when it's doing what they

3763
02:33:59,161 --> 02:34:02,850
feel they can get away with.
And I don't know where that gets us.

3764
02:34:02,851 --> 02:34:06,630
At the end of the day,
this whole tRump thing is getting

3765
02:34:06,631 --> 02:34:09,990
weirder and weirder with every day.
So to even predict where we could be six

3766
02:34:09,991 --> 02:34:12,660
months from now,
forget about four years from now or

3767
02:34:12,661 --> 02:34:16,050
three and a half years from now.
I think that when you look at some of

3768
02:34:16,051 --> 02:34:18,280
the stuff that he does,
you really have to wonder

3769
02:34:18,280 --> 02:34:21,430
about his mental health and I don't,
I don't say that like,

3770
02:34:21,810 --> 02:34:23,440
you know,
there's a lot of people that are saying

3771
02:34:23,470 --> 02:34:26,350
that I think because,
because they would like to think that

3772
02:34:26,351 --> 02:34:29,290
he's mentally incompetent and it became
convenIent for their argument.

3773
02:34:29,560 --> 02:34:31,510
But when,
when I read that,

3774
02:34:31,840 --> 02:34:36,840
I don't know what agency it was,
was trying to get the ip addresses of

3775
02:34:37,661 --> 02:34:40,450
people that visited an anti trump
website.

3776
02:34:41,070 --> 02:34:43,390
Did you hear about that?
Like sessions is working on.

3777
02:34:43,540 --> 02:34:45,250
That's,
that's insane.

3778
02:34:45,670 --> 02:34:47,800
Because I could have visited that site
if somebody sent me a link.

3779
02:34:47,801 --> 02:34:49,550
You got to see this crazy anti-trump
site.

3780
02:34:50,050 --> 02:34:52,540
that doesn't mean I'm a part of that
community or anything like that.

3781
02:34:52,690 --> 02:34:56,230
You can't get ip addresses for him.
Someone who visits things online either

3782
02:34:56,231 --> 02:34:56,640
side.

3783
02:34:56,640 --> 02:34:58,890
Anytime it does.
I don't care which administration it is.

3784
02:34:58,891 --> 02:34:59,790
I mean,
you can argue.

3785
02:35:01,110 --> 02:35:01,620
I mean,
yeah,

3786
02:35:01,620 --> 02:35:04,680
it's just the potential for abuse of
power.

3787
02:35:04,681 --> 02:35:07,560
I've always agreed with that idea.
I'm a small government person,

3788
02:35:07,561 --> 02:35:12,561
so the potential for abuse of power is
always there and needs to be monitored.

3789
02:35:13,690 --> 02:35:15,160
Potential catastrophic.
Yeah,

3790
02:35:15,180 --> 02:35:18,040
because as soon as people lose
confidence and that's one of the biggest

3791
02:35:18,041 --> 02:35:21,370
issues with trump as a president,
if people lose confidence in the

3792
02:35:21,371 --> 02:35:24,040
institution,
like one of the things that was very

3793
02:35:24,041 --> 02:35:28,000
disturbing to a lot of people was that
when he had those russians over and he

3794
02:35:28,001 --> 02:35:32,740
was explaining how isis is thinking
about using laptops as bombs and they're

3795
02:35:32,741 --> 02:35:33,790
like,
jesus fucking christ,

3796
02:35:33,791 --> 02:35:36,760
this is top secret shit.
You're noT supposed to say that because

3797
02:35:36,761 --> 02:35:41,761
then this could potentially compromise
people that are embedded in isis that

3798
02:35:42,071 --> 02:35:45,380
are distributing this information.
Like you have a bunch of people that

3799
02:35:45,390 --> 02:35:48,310
you're giving up this information.
There's a trickle down effect and it

3800
02:35:48,311 --> 02:35:53,311
also diminishes the potential for people
to trust the office person running all

3801
02:35:55,140 --> 02:35:55,980
the time.
You see that?

3802
02:35:55,981 --> 02:35:58,920
I mean the previous administration had
problems where they sort of in their

3803
02:35:58,921 --> 02:36:03,540
desire to rush to the podium to declare
a victory and something.

3804
02:36:03,690 --> 02:36:08,690
There was
a disregard for sources and methods of

3805
02:36:08,971 --> 02:36:11,490
disregard for the importance of
occasionally,

3806
02:36:11,520 --> 02:36:14,070
you know,
secrets are good on,

3807
02:36:14,100 --> 02:36:14,461
uh,
in,

3808
02:36:14,461 --> 02:36:17,280
in many cases when it comes to intel
operations,

3809
02:36:17,281 --> 02:36:18,870
you want again,
you want checks and Balances.

3810
02:36:18,871 --> 02:36:20,250
That's,
I completely get that.

3811
02:36:20,280 --> 02:36:22,200
And of course people are losing their
mindset going,

3812
02:36:22,201 --> 02:36:25,260
I can't believe it's cia guy talking
about checks and balances because,

3813
02:36:25,290 --> 02:36:26,310
you know,
I'm sure he doesn't believe it,

3814
02:36:26,790 --> 02:36:30,480
but it's true.
The place you know for that is in the

3815
02:36:31,170 --> 02:36:35,040
committees and up on capital hill where
you're supposed to have an engaged,

3816
02:36:35,340 --> 02:36:38,220
aggressively curious,
inquisitive.

3817
02:36:38,600 --> 02:36:43,110
I'm operation up there between the
various committees that are supposed are

3818
02:36:43,111 --> 02:36:45,230
charged with overseeing,
you know,

3819
02:36:45,320 --> 02:36:46,830
the work of the intel community.

3820
02:36:47,270 --> 02:36:49,740
And,
and oftentimes they do know exactly

3821
02:36:49,741 --> 02:36:51,780
what's going on.
They just play this game where they

3822
02:36:51,980 --> 02:36:54,450
disavow any knowledge when it looks like
this political blow back.

3823
02:36:54,870 --> 02:36:58,980
there's a fairly well worn path between
langley as an example in capitol hill

3824
02:36:59,340 --> 02:37:01,800
for the briefings telling people this is
what's going on,

3825
02:37:01,801 --> 02:37:03,120
this is what's happening.
And then,

3826
02:37:03,630 --> 02:37:06,330
you know,
the general unwritten understanding is,

3827
02:37:06,440 --> 02:37:07,530
you know,
they're going to be assholes.

3828
02:37:07,531 --> 02:37:10,800
If it becomes politically expedient to
do so,

3829
02:37:10,801 --> 02:37:13,680
they'll disavow that they knew about it
and they'll demand in,

3830
02:37:13,860 --> 02:37:16,010
you know,
and it's just so a game that gets played

3831
02:37:16,011 --> 02:37:17,690
sometimes.
But um,

3832
02:37:18,560 --> 02:37:19,550
yeah,
I think,

3833
02:37:20,030 --> 02:37:22,170
um,
I think that it's,

3834
02:37:22,260 --> 02:37:23,300
it's,
it's hard to say I've got,

3835
02:37:23,330 --> 02:37:28,330
I've got friends who are very,
a hard left and they're convinced that,

3836
02:37:28,970 --> 02:37:32,000
that trump's on his way out in the not
too distant future.

3837
02:37:33,050 --> 02:37:34,490
I think that's a lot of wishful
thinking,

3838
02:37:34,910 --> 02:37:36,590
but I don't think he's gonna make it for
years.

3839
02:37:36,650 --> 02:37:39,140
I might be wrong.
It just doesn't seem like it.

3840
02:37:39,260 --> 02:37:41,900
I think he's also incredibly resilient
though,

3841
02:37:42,210 --> 02:37:44,600
because he is,
he's unusual in that regard.

3842
02:37:44,690 --> 02:37:49,690
He's also a guy though that wants love
and respect and wants to be a winner.

3843
02:37:50,150 --> 02:37:55,150
Like everything he does it in regards to
business decisions mean he,

3844
02:37:56,690 --> 02:38:00,020
he'll take something personally himself
to declare a victory.

3845
02:38:00,260 --> 02:38:03,830
Right.
And you got to wonder whether or not we

3846
02:38:03,831 --> 02:38:05,690
would put someone in position,
you know,

3847
02:38:05,990 --> 02:38:08,330
to say like,
the fake news is so out to get him to.

3848
02:38:08,331 --> 02:38:11,840
What we've done is we've created a
structure that's the best people for the

3849
02:38:11,841 --> 02:38:13,880
job.
And then I'm going to concentrate on

3850
02:38:13,881 --> 02:38:15,710
business and helping them from the
outside.

3851
02:38:15,790 --> 02:38:19,520
you could escape and have some sort of
escape route.

3852
02:38:19,790 --> 02:38:21,170
There's not.
Again,

3853
02:38:21,580 --> 02:38:25,850
it sometimes seems as if there's no
grownups in charge of the messaging that

3854
02:38:25,851 --> 02:38:26,780
comes out of the white house.

3855
02:38:26,780 --> 02:38:28,490
Right.
And that's Been the case since day one

3856
02:38:28,491 --> 02:38:29,690
basically.
And part of it is,

3857
02:38:30,440 --> 02:38:31,760
you know,
maybe people say,

3858
02:38:31,761 --> 02:38:32,860
well,
that's the way he likes to play.

3859
02:38:32,880 --> 02:38:35,300
He likes to play people off of each
other anD he likes the chaos.

3860
02:38:35,301 --> 02:38:36,470
And they,
well,

3861
02:38:36,471 --> 02:38:38,390
you know why he never ran a big
organization.

3862
02:38:38,391 --> 02:38:40,220
People imagined or thought if they
didn't,

3863
02:38:40,240 --> 02:38:40,840
if they,
you know,

3864
02:38:40,840 --> 02:38:44,150
if you didn't spend any time up in New
York and having watched the trump

3865
02:38:44,300 --> 02:38:46,160
organization for years and years and
years,

3866
02:38:46,161 --> 02:38:49,250
if he hadn't done that,
then you imagine it to be this massive

3867
02:38:49,251 --> 02:38:50,660
organization.
Well it's not,

3868
02:38:50,720 --> 02:38:53,060
it's always been kind of a family
business.

3869
02:38:53,061 --> 02:38:56,150
Right.
And it's just so the chaos that's

3870
02:38:56,151 --> 02:38:58,580
around,
that shouldn't be a surprise.

3871
02:38:58,581 --> 02:39:00,950
What is a surprise is that,
You know,

3872
02:39:00,951 --> 02:39:04,670
he wasn't,
he wasn't sharp enough for what I know

3873
02:39:04,671 --> 02:39:06,920
what it is.
They tend to understand the importance

3874
02:39:06,921 --> 02:39:10,820
of inserting the discipline in there and
at least if nothing else,

3875
02:39:10,821 --> 02:39:14,750
being consistent and disciplined with
the messaging that comes out and just

3876
02:39:14,900 --> 02:39:16,460
quit the fucking tweeting.

3877
02:39:19,070 --> 02:39:19,611
People say,
oh,

3878
02:39:19,611 --> 02:39:22,220
I love it.
That's what makes him him for people.

3879
02:39:22,221 --> 02:39:25,400
It's an entertainment that,
you know,

3880
02:39:26,140 --> 02:39:28,970
it's a,
it's a portal for fun,

3881
02:39:29,370 --> 02:39:30,650
like fun.
I mean,

3882
02:39:30,651 --> 02:39:33,620
that's what you're getting out of it.
You like seeing the stupid shitty rights

3883
02:39:33,621 --> 02:39:34,700
and go,
oh my god.

3884
02:39:35,060 --> 02:39:36,950
And you correlate some of the time so
that he writes it.

3885
02:39:37,030 --> 02:39:39,140
Yeah,
it's 2:00 in the morning.

3886
02:39:39,141 --> 02:39:40,360
Is that interesting?
I don't want,

3887
02:39:40,580 --> 02:39:43,040
but that's the thing.
I don't know.

3888
02:39:43,070 --> 02:39:43,910
Again,
I get it.

3889
02:39:43,911 --> 02:39:44,890
I understand people,
you know,

3890
02:39:44,930 --> 02:39:48,200
people are excited to have a genuine
person who's not a politician in there

3891
02:39:48,201 --> 02:39:50,360
and you know,
there's some benefit to shake the system

3892
02:39:50,361 --> 02:39:53,690
up for sure and need some shaking,
but you know,

3893
02:39:53,691 --> 02:39:55,880
how much shaking is actually been done.
I don't want that.

3894
02:39:55,910 --> 02:39:56,511
I mean,
I,

3895
02:39:56,511 --> 02:39:59,300
you know,
I'd rather the president not spend as

3896
02:39:59,301 --> 02:40:03,720
much time watching tv or a tweeting,
um,

3897
02:40:03,950 --> 02:40:08,950
and working to try to accomplish
something major in the way of tax reform

3898
02:40:09,740 --> 02:40:11,560
or even the healthcare problem couldn't
lord,

3899
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:13,100
we're not even to get that done.

3900
02:40:13,440 --> 02:40:18,440
I think there's also a real problem from
the top down when the commander in chief

3901
02:40:19,240 --> 02:40:22,710
likes to personally insult people.
I think when you do that,

3902
02:40:22,711 --> 02:40:25,680
you,
you make that kind of behavior not just

3903
02:40:25,681 --> 02:40:28,390
acceptable but standard.
yeah.

3904
02:40:28,650 --> 02:40:29,161
well it's like,
well,

3905
02:40:29,161 --> 02:40:31,380
with your kids and kids,
you know,

3906
02:40:31,381 --> 02:40:36,270
if they were probably more to the point,
it's like people we talked about the

3907
02:40:36,271 --> 02:40:37,560
fact that nobody can keep their yap
shot,

3908
02:40:37,561 --> 02:40:39,420
right?
So secrets get out there right now and

3909
02:40:39,421 --> 02:40:43,710
that's because we've created this
environment.

3910
02:40:43,860 --> 02:40:46,140
If it's okay for a former defense
secretary,

3911
02:40:46,141 --> 02:40:49,140
a former head of the cia or whatever,
when they get out to write a book,

3912
02:40:49,200 --> 02:40:51,450
right?
And they're getting paid millions of

3913
02:40:51,450 --> 02:40:52,410
dollars to write that book.
So you know,

3914
02:40:52,411 --> 02:40:54,120
they got to cough up something
interesting.

3915
02:40:55,170 --> 02:40:57,750
IF they do that over a period of time
and they've been doing that,

3916
02:40:57,751 --> 02:40:59,490
then people down below think,
well,

3917
02:40:59,491 --> 02:41:03,180
why the fuck yeah,
all sign the same agreements to keep her

3918
02:41:03,181 --> 02:41:05,100
yap shut,
but maybe it's okay.

3919
02:41:05,520 --> 02:41:07,470
So it starts at the top.
I think,

3920
02:41:07,471 --> 02:41:09,750
you know,
and it's just like with parenting,

3921
02:41:09,751 --> 02:41:12,060
you know,
I mean they got to see you do the things

3922
02:41:12,061 --> 02:41:14,700
that you tell them to do.
Otherwise kids are sharp enough to

3923
02:41:14,701 --> 02:41:16,170
think,
well you're not doing it right.

3924
02:41:16,710 --> 02:41:18,600
You know?
So I think it's,

3925
02:41:19,900 --> 02:41:21,180
I don't know where I was going with
that.

3926
02:41:21,181 --> 02:41:24,540
I tend to get,
I tend to get down the rabbit hole and

3927
02:41:24,541 --> 02:41:27,030
distracted.
This is a distracting subject because

3928
02:41:27,031 --> 02:41:29,670
it's really difficult to see how do we
get out of this?

3929
02:41:29,930 --> 02:41:30,640
Like,
well okay,

3930
02:41:30,640 --> 02:41:32,550
we've,
we've obviously got this guy who's

3931
02:41:32,551 --> 02:41:34,800
running the country is doing a lot of
things that people don't enjoy.

3932
02:41:35,130 --> 02:41:37,460
They don't like.
They see a lot of problems in it and

3933
02:41:37,461 --> 02:41:40,350
they don't see a,
a real light at the end of the tunnel.

3934
02:41:40,620 --> 02:41:43,740
It's like what's the best case scenario?
Is this guy going to get us in a fucking

3935
02:41:43,741 --> 02:41:45,150
war with North Korea?

3936
02:41:45,150 --> 02:41:46,620
So we realized like,
oh,

3937
02:41:46,621 --> 02:41:48,930
North Korea and us,
we know we're going to war now.

3938
02:41:48,960 --> 02:41:50,700
This could have been avoided.
We got to get rid of them.

3939
02:41:51,050 --> 02:41:53,670
I mean,
what's the worst case scenario that has

3940
02:41:53,671 --> 02:41:58,671
to happen where we can survive as a
country but still just recover from

3941
02:42:00,061 --> 02:42:02,970
this.
The North Korea thing is,

3942
02:42:02,971 --> 02:42:06,900
is uh,
is kind of frustrating in a sense,

3943
02:42:06,901 --> 02:42:09,390
right?
Because nobody should be out there

3944
02:42:09,391 --> 02:42:11,220
thinking that.
And I'm sure you know,

3945
02:42:11,250 --> 02:42:16,250
very few do that somehow.
We got to that point with North Korea

3946
02:42:16,740 --> 02:42:19,250
because president trump is president,
right?

3947
02:42:19,620 --> 02:42:22,800
We got to this point when North Korea,
because we kicked the can down the road

3948
02:42:22,801 --> 02:42:27,801
for two and a half decades of failed
foreign policy with North Korea and in

3949
02:42:28,861 --> 02:42:32,250
part with China.
And so they've been very clear about

3950
02:42:32,251 --> 02:42:35,790
what they wanted to do and now they've
gotten to that point where they've

3951
02:42:35,791 --> 02:42:39,180
created the weapons program and the
ballistic missile program that they want

3952
02:42:39,240 --> 02:42:40,980
or that they are close to having.

3953
02:42:41,460 --> 02:42:44,310
And you knoW,
when you get to that point,

3954
02:42:44,370 --> 02:42:47,310
you naturally lose some of your options,
you know,

3955
02:42:47,311 --> 02:42:51,000
so the decision tree gets smaller and
you know,

3956
02:42:51,001 --> 02:42:55,590
trump happens to be the president in
office now when North Korea reaches that

3957
02:42:55,591 --> 02:42:58,770
stage and North Korea is pretty
consistent in the way that they've been

3958
02:42:58,771 --> 02:42:59,790
behaving,
you know,

3959
02:42:59,791 --> 02:43:02,970
they're always doing the same thing.
They throw their teddy out of the cot

3960
02:43:02,971 --> 02:43:05,670
when they get upset and they want some
attention where they feel they can get

3961
02:43:05,671 --> 02:43:09,120
something out of it.
Typically they do get something or China

3962
02:43:09,150 --> 02:43:12,010
get something that then they're willing
to reign them in

3963
02:43:12,010 --> 02:43:13,410
to some degree,
um,

3964
02:43:14,420 --> 02:43:15,540
in just like,
you know,

3965
02:43:15,610 --> 02:43:19,330
trump could well Be the guy sitting in
an office where Iran gets to that point

3966
02:43:19,360 --> 02:43:22,930
because anybody who thinks Iran is not
spinning the centrifuges and continuing

3967
02:43:22,931 --> 02:43:25,150
to work on their weapons capabilities
is,

3968
02:43:25,210 --> 02:43:27,430
is somewhat insane.
I mean that,

3969
02:43:28,180 --> 02:43:30,860
there is no,
uh,

3970
02:43:31,240 --> 02:43:34,480
john kerry said the whole Iran deal was
based on verification,

3971
02:43:34,790 --> 02:43:35,590
you know,
on.

3972
02:43:35,590 --> 02:43:38,470
And we don't have verification.
We don't have,

3973
02:43:38,471 --> 02:43:40,270
we don't,
we haven't gotten access still to some

3974
02:43:40,271 --> 02:43:44,830
facilities that we would need to see.
We signed off with the previous

3975
02:43:44,831 --> 02:43:46,270
administration,
signed off on a,

3976
02:43:46,990 --> 02:43:50,680
on a study or a,
an assessment basically just to get the

3977
02:43:50,681 --> 02:43:54,730
deal done because the iranians insisted
that that investigation into their

3978
02:43:54,731 --> 02:43:58,810
capabilities at one of their military
sites come to a close.

3979
02:43:59,180 --> 02:44:02,590
It wasn't like we suddenly got answers
and we were satisfied tHat there was no.

3980
02:44:02,630 --> 02:44:03,490
And we just,
okay,

3981
02:44:03,491 --> 02:44:06,880
that was part of the deal.
So we'll end that investigation,

3982
02:44:06,881 --> 02:44:09,910
but we don't have that verification.
so trump could do my point being trump

3983
02:44:09,911 --> 02:44:12,890
could just be sitting in that seat,
uh,

3984
02:44:12,910 --> 02:44:16,300
when North Korea gets where they are
when Iran possibly,

3985
02:44:16,360 --> 02:44:17,740
you know,
because that could happen sooner rather

3986
02:44:17,741 --> 02:44:19,030
than later.
And then,

3987
02:44:19,031 --> 02:44:20,770
yeah.
Then you'd like to think that the person

3988
02:44:20,771 --> 02:44:24,670
in that position will be rational.
Yes.

3989
02:44:24,770 --> 02:44:25,660
Little more reasoned.

3990
02:44:25,840 --> 02:44:27,640
I read an article today that is saying
that,

3991
02:44:27,810 --> 02:44:32,350
that him saying all that crazy shit
about fire and fury at the world has

3992
02:44:32,351 --> 02:44:35,560
ever seen,
might've actually Been what he needed to

3993
02:44:35,561 --> 02:44:37,900
say.
When you're dealing with someone like

3994
02:44:37,901 --> 02:44:39,020
North Korea.
And I mean,

3995
02:44:39,021 --> 02:44:43,570
it was obviously an opinion piece,
but the argument was that when you're

3996
02:44:43,571 --> 02:44:46,900
dealing with someone does as fucked up
as kim jong,

3997
02:44:47,290 --> 02:44:51,640
you're probably better off having
someone as crazy as trump as president

3998
02:44:51,641 --> 02:44:54,400
who's going to say some ridiculous shit
like that.

3999
02:44:54,401 --> 02:44:55,390
So this guy goes,
all right,

4000
02:44:55,510 --> 02:44:56,980
this guy's just as nuts as me.

4001
02:44:57,780 --> 02:44:59,660
Does that mean that there could be.
And frankly,

4002
02:44:59,661 --> 02:45:02,420
those messages that he's,
he does his things that he said were

4003
02:45:02,421 --> 02:45:04,670
probably more important in terms of how
China received them.

4004
02:45:04,910 --> 02:45:08,720
Then how North Korea received them,
and honestly,

4005
02:45:09,100 --> 02:45:13,520
20 plus years of,
of measure diplomatic language and

4006
02:45:14,870 --> 02:45:18,080
restrained talk didn't really do
anything.

4007
02:45:18,110 --> 02:45:21,680
It just kicked the can down the road.
So yeah,

4008
02:45:21,710 --> 02:45:25,040
maybe,
maybe a different approach in a measured

4009
02:45:25,041 --> 02:45:27,740
fashion.
But the problem is because of their sort

4010
02:45:27,741 --> 02:45:31,190
of the perceived chaos,
nobody has the confidence to believe

4011
02:45:31,191 --> 02:45:34,340
that he's doing it in a disciplined,
reasoned way.

4012
02:45:34,640 --> 02:45:35,690
So they don't look at it and go,
yeah,

4013
02:45:35,691 --> 02:45:37,830
he's saying that's a message he's
sending it.

4014
02:45:37,840 --> 02:45:40,730
Just looked at it and go,
you just go blasting off another tweet

4015
02:45:40,830 --> 02:45:41,840
up,
Scott Adams.

4016
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,520
Scott adams is the only one that
believes this is some large,

4017
02:45:44,521 --> 02:45:47,520
clever masterplan.
We mIss scott as a dilbert.

4018
02:45:47,550 --> 02:45:48,383
dilbert.
Yeah.

4019
02:45:48,490 --> 02:45:50,450
I know about that.
Scott adams,

4020
02:45:50,460 --> 02:45:53,010
like the most rational,
logical,

4021
02:45:53,011 --> 02:45:56,470
intelligent trump supporter that's ever
lived and he's not really a trump

4022
02:45:56,471 --> 02:45:56,860
support.
Support.

4023
02:45:56,860 --> 02:45:59,010
Didn't vote for trump because he talks
about these things.

4024
02:45:59,011 --> 02:46:01,650
He doesn't want to vote for president
because he doesn't want to have a stake

4025
02:46:01,651 --> 02:46:03,960
in the game,
but he believes that trump is a master

4026
02:46:03,961 --> 02:46:07,920
persuader and that everything he's doing
is because of the art of persuasion.

4027
02:46:08,190 --> 02:46:09,580
It's very interesting.
Interesting.

4028
02:46:09,600 --> 02:46:10,080
Yeah.

4029
02:46:10,080 --> 02:46:13,570
I'd falls apart under scrutiny.
Kind of fell apart with his art.

4030
02:46:13,760 --> 02:46:16,940
These,
these arguments with a podcast with sam

4031
02:46:16,941 --> 02:46:18,910
harris is pretty fascinating.
No,

4032
02:46:19,340 --> 02:46:19,850
I mean it's,
it's,

4033
02:46:19,850 --> 02:46:21,610
it's.
I can see where people.

4034
02:46:21,730 --> 02:46:26,180
I've heard that from trump supporters
when they talk about how he's.

4035
02:46:26,420 --> 02:46:28,970
Everything's measured.
Everything in his own way.

4036
02:46:28,971 --> 02:46:31,550
His is,
is actually disciplined because I've

4037
02:46:31,551 --> 02:46:34,370
said numerous times that I think they
lacked discipline and they said,

4038
02:46:34,371 --> 02:46:34,611
no,
no,

4039
02:46:34,611 --> 02:46:34,881
no,
no.

4040
02:46:34,881 --> 02:46:39,881
Actually this is all part of the plan.
I'm thinking it doesn't look like it's

4041
02:46:40,101 --> 02:46:43,310
part of the plan because you've got
other people that are in those senior

4042
02:46:43,311 --> 02:46:46,640
positions that seem to be scrambling to
catch up to the plan.

4043
02:46:46,641 --> 02:46:49,310
And if it was part of the plan,
he'd like to think it was,

4044
02:46:49,630 --> 02:46:50,330
you know,
it was,

4045
02:46:50,330 --> 02:46:52,320
it was part of a conversation amongst
the,

4046
02:46:52,321 --> 02:46:53,091
uh,
the cabinet.

4047
02:46:53,091 --> 02:46:54,830
But anyway,
uh,

4048
02:46:54,910 --> 02:46:55,471
yeah,
so I,

4049
02:46:55,471 --> 02:46:57,080
I don't think,
you know,

4050
02:46:57,110 --> 02:46:57,943
I don't think we're.

4051
02:46:58,550 --> 02:47:00,590
Missiles aren't going to be flying
between us and North Korea.

4052
02:47:00,591 --> 02:47:03,950
I think China may actually see at this
stage of the game,

4053
02:47:03,980 --> 02:47:08,510
um,
they may see that they need to,

4054
02:47:08,780 --> 02:47:11,270
uh,
affect the different mindset for North

4055
02:47:11,270 --> 02:47:13,760
Korea and they may be doing that and
part of it may be,

4056
02:47:13,761 --> 02:47:15,800
again,
not necessarily because it was a reason

4057
02:47:15,801 --> 02:47:18,500
to thought out plan,
but trump's comments about the trade

4058
02:47:18,501 --> 02:47:22,520
imbalance with China.
If the chinese legitimately thought that

4059
02:47:22,521 --> 02:47:26,180
we were going to put that under the
microscope and maybe attack them on the

4060
02:47:26,181 --> 02:47:29,510
trade imbalance in a serious way,
then maybe they look at that and go,

4061
02:47:29,511 --> 02:47:31,160
okay,
well we can get them to back off.

4062
02:47:31,640 --> 02:47:32,361
Then.
Yes,

4063
02:47:32,361 --> 02:47:35,820
we're willing to extend ourselves and
actually listened to the sanctions and

4064
02:47:35,840 --> 02:47:40,580
take part in the sanctions and exert
some additional pressure on North Korea

4065
02:47:40,581 --> 02:47:43,340
that maybe they weren't in the past
because China always accidents own best

4066
02:47:43,341 --> 02:47:45,650
interest and so they're,
they're looking for something,

4067
02:47:45,651 --> 02:47:47,000
what are we going to get out of this?

4068
02:47:47,300 --> 02:47:49,460
And maybe so maybe that's,
you know,

4069
02:47:50,240 --> 02:47:51,050
in.
Anyway,

4070
02:47:51,050 --> 02:47:53,270
in the meantime it seems to have
resolved itself to some degree,

4071
02:47:53,271 --> 02:47:54,350
but I,
I do worry that,

4072
02:47:54,490 --> 02:47:55,311
you know,
once again,

4073
02:47:55,311 --> 02:47:57,290
and we're Just kicking it down the road,
you know,

4074
02:47:57,430 --> 02:47:59,840
I mean until there's something,
some sea change where,

4075
02:48:00,340 --> 02:48:03,380
you know,
maybe somehow we can affect a unified,

4076
02:48:03,550 --> 02:48:04,383
you know,
uh,

4077
02:48:04,430 --> 02:48:07,640
Korea with china's assistance.
It's going to have to be with their

4078
02:48:07,641 --> 02:48:11,450
assistants and blessing obviously a or
something along those lines to get

4079
02:48:11,840 --> 02:48:13,630
actual deterrence,
you know,

4080
02:48:13,640 --> 02:48:17,600
off the table and more of a removal of
the nuclear threat.

4081
02:48:18,680 --> 02:48:20,030
you know,
we're just going to be doing this same

4082
02:48:20,031 --> 02:48:23,300
conversation in another couple of years
when they rattle the cage again and we

4083
02:48:23,301 --> 02:48:26,900
have to figure out how to resolve it.
And the further you go down the road and

4084
02:48:26,901 --> 02:48:29,780
the better their capabilities get,
the fewer options you have.

4085
02:48:29,840 --> 02:48:30,970
So.
Well mike,

4086
02:48:30,971 --> 02:48:33,560
I'm sufficiently depressed.
Thank you very much.

4087
02:48:33,980 --> 02:48:36,690
My job.
Will this meet up again at six months if

4088
02:48:36,700 --> 02:48:39,720
the shit hits the fan?
So you know,

4089
02:48:39,770 --> 02:48:42,530
it's always fun talking to you about
your insight.

4090
02:48:42,560 --> 02:48:44,840
I went off on a tangent there,
don't we both did.

4091
02:48:45,330 --> 02:48:46,820
That's part of the program.
cool man.

4092
02:48:46,940 --> 02:48:47,990
Thank you brother.
Appreciate it.

4093
02:48:48,050 --> 02:48:49,040
Thank you.
All right fOlks.

4094
02:48:49,041 --> 02:48:49,874
We'll see you soon.

4095
02:48:50,240 --> 02:48:50,750
Bye.
