1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,210
Person to do it on their thing,
like we're plugging into it.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,630
We're live.
We're just discussing a very critical,

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,420
um,
sound engineering issues.

4
00:00:09,421 --> 00:00:13,650
We will take care of on the next version
of this studio.

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:19,060
I'm going to build something either in 
downtown or near here and we haven't 

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:19,060
decided.

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,810
Really.
I always figured you'd had it here 

8
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:22,810
because you live here.
Yeah,

9
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:22,810
I do,

10
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,770
but I like downtown.
I like the idea of being on the top of a

11
00:00:24,771 --> 00:00:29,771
big building.
My other option and I had been looking 

12
00:00:29,771 --> 00:00:31,991
at land.
My other option is in Topanga Canyon to 

13
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:35,651
build an actual compound.
My problem is I'm afraid because I know 

14
00:00:35,961 --> 00:00:38,060
me.
I don't necessarily trust me.

15
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:43,300
I'm afraid I'll go whole hog Colonel 
Kurtz and start a real compound once I 

16
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:49,001
have the actual land and start putting 
things in and realize I'm not really 

17
00:00:49,001 --> 00:00:50,240
that restricted financially from 
building shit.

18
00:00:50,241 --> 00:00:55,241
I might just start getting crazy and 
then you can put all your followers 

19
00:00:55,241 --> 00:00:55,241
could work.
That's the problem.

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,280
Then that becomes a problem.
The unstable ones shows up with the 

21
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:00,280
fucking suicide vest.

22
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,470
Downtown's a bit of a pain in the ass 
though.

23
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,880
Getting theirs sucks and I did.
Someone had a show down there and I had 

24
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,231
to park like in this weird thing and cut
through a macy's to get to the where the

25
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,600
thing was.
Downtown can be a little tricky unless 

26
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:16,730
you get a cool,
so ho kind of loft space.

27
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,260
That's what I'm thinking.
What I was thinking of is getting a high

28
00:01:20,261 --> 00:01:23,020
rise,
like a top floor on a high rise.

29
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,990
Get crazy and get something with the 
most dope,

30
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:30,210
ridiculous view and have that view be 
the background when we do shows those

31
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:33,290
especially nighttime shows,
that'd be pretty sweet.

32
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:36,440
And a good vantage point when the 
earthquake comes.

33
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,840
Have you ever been in a high rise during
the quake?

34
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:43,870
Well,
I'm going to have a parachute for you 

35
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,650
and for Jamie and for all of us and 
we're just going to shoot through one of

36
00:01:45,651 --> 00:01:48,890
the windows.
I'll have a shotgun blast through one of

37
00:01:48,891 --> 00:01:50,570
the windows and they were just going to 
jump.

38
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:54,380
I was in San Francisco two summers ago,
not last summer.

39
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:59,381
The one before during that earthquake 
they had a little up in Napa was napa 

40
00:01:59,691 --> 00:02:01,160
one.
And uh,

41
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,860
I had a show there that night.
I'm in a high rise,

42
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:08,810
get up to go to the bathroom at around 
two in the morning on my way back.

43
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:13,880
But the whole building,
like a rubber band just back,

44
00:02:13,881 --> 00:02:15,410
I was like,
what the.

45
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:21,080
Oh,
they were on rollers and that thing just

46
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,870
scariest.
I just laid on the bed and it was like,

47
00:02:23,871 --> 00:02:24,950
all right,
maybe this is going down.

48
00:02:24,951 --> 00:02:27,050
Maybe it's laid on the bed,
laid on the bed.

49
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:27,800
I just,
I just,

50
00:02:27,801 --> 00:02:29,470
yeah,
just kinda collapsed on the bed.

51
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:32,270
Like you're supposed to get into a 
doorframe there was,

52
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:35,500
there was nothing but just tech.
Yeah,

53
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,680
that's completely really weird.
And I was like,

54
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:39,680
and it was,
oh,

55
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,980
I'm like to,
I just go to the airport,

56
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,750
actually just get the hell out of town.
Right.

57
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,140
Start running towards the middle of the 
country.

58
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,470
Brassica that was my instinct.
I looked out the window.

59
00:02:54,471 --> 00:02:56,120
I didn't see people like running and 
drove.

60
00:02:56,121 --> 00:02:57,570
So I just said,
well this,

61
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,130
we'll see how freaked out I am if I can 
just

62
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:03,670
go back to sleep.
And I did just fell asleep.

63
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,550
Did you ever read the article?
Was It in New Yorker?

64
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,530
I don't remember what magazine it was 
in.

65
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:14,010
There was an article that was 
essentially saying the Pacific 

66
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:14,530
northwest,
like Seattle is a ticking time bomb.

67
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:19,531
It's just a matter of time before it 
gets hit by a massive tsunami and an 

68
00:03:19,531 --> 00:03:23,311
earthquake.
One hundred percent going to happen 

69
00:03:23,311 --> 00:03:23,890
might happen in 100 years.
Might happen into who knows?

70
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,060
Yeah,
I'm going,

71
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,760
I'm going there this weekend.
You Parlor,

72
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,070
live,
love that place.

73
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:35,071
Good Club.
That combines my two favorite things in 

74
00:03:35,071 --> 00:03:35,590
life,
pool playing pool and the comedy club.

75
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:37,030
It's almost like they designed it for 
me.

76
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,640
It is pretty perfect.
I haven't been there in awhile.

77
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,960
So what?
What happens?

78
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:45,961
Like when they say like at that level 
that they say it'll hit what happens to 

79
00:03:46,241 --> 00:03:51,241
like,
does that mean like Seattle goes into 

80
00:03:51,241 --> 00:03:51,241
the ocean?

81
00:03:51,241 --> 00:03:51,730
The Article?
It was the New Yorker,

82
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:56,740
the really big ones by the way,
received so much hate and I think 

83
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:00,430
fucking threats and all kinds of crazy 
shit that she had to.

84
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,190
I think she had to make an amendment to 
this,

85
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,790
but not so big one to say,
hey fuckers relaxed.

86
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:11,791
I didn't mean to scare you.
I'm just a notice like Mexico seems 

87
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:12,380
fine.
Look,

88
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:17,390
it goes all the way down to California 
all the way to the see the appeal that 

89
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,540
they're showing in the illustration.
Think Mexico's our move.

90
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:20,770
Come on Tom.
Papa.

91
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:21,910
Let's do it.
Let's go.

92
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,710
San Diego might not be a bad spot 
either.

93
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,130
It doesn't seem to be.
It's like falling off.

94
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,540
It's not two quickie.
No,

95
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,500
and it's filled with military people.
They'll know what to do.

96
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,430
Yeah.
Pendleton.

97
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,570
Yeah,
they're right there.

98
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,250
Tell me what to do.
That's a good spot to be.

99
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:39,250
If the shit hits the fan bunch of 
motherfuckers who prepared for the shit 

100
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:39,520
hitting the fan.
Do you have a kit?

101
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,810
A Kit?
Yeah.

102
00:04:40,811 --> 00:04:43,500
Do you have an emergency kit?
I have food and food.

103
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,190
Dried freeze.
Dried food and water.

104
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,780
Keep it in the garage.
Fridge.

105
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,590
Yeah.
Well,

106
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:50,530
I have a garage freezers,
freezers in the garage,

107
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:54,880
and have giant coolers that'll keep.
I have these yeti coolers you ever said,

108
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:59,881
you know what?
A yeti cooler and Yeti coolers are 

109
00:04:59,881 --> 00:05:01,120
really high end.
A hunting coolers,

110
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,850
outdoorsmen cooler.
They will keep ice.

111
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,610
I use it when I Brian,
things like if I Brian,

112
00:05:06,611 --> 00:05:08,160
a ham,
like I smoked Hams.

113
00:05:08,161 --> 00:05:09,310
You ever smoking hand?
No.

114
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,480
Oh,
so delicious.

115
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,080
Yeah,
man.

116
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:14,020
There's nothing like it.
It takes a long time to do it looks like

117
00:05:14,021 --> 00:05:16,450
six days to Brian it.
Six days.

118
00:05:16,451 --> 00:05:17,350
Six days.
Wow.

119
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:18,150
Yeah.
Um,

120
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,530
but then once you smoke it and then cook
it,

121
00:05:20,531 --> 00:05:22,930
like right out of the smoker and then 
serve it.

122
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,430
Oh my God.
It's amazing.

123
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:29,970
My kids scream when they eat it because 
it just melt in your mouth.

124
00:05:31,211 --> 00:05:33,790
It's just so tender and moist and 
delicious.

125
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,320
So where's the cooler?
Come in?

126
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:39,310
What do you mean you.
I leave it in the cooler for six days by

127
00:05:39,311 --> 00:05:41,140
itself in a bucket.
So I,

128
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:42,850
Brian the ham.
I take the ham,

129
00:05:42,851 --> 00:05:45,970
I put a bucket of water with salt,
garlic,

130
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,270
some brown sugar,
and a few other spices.

131
00:05:49,271 --> 00:05:54,271
I forget what it is.
Some Himalayan pink salt and then it 

132
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:58,261
sits in this cooler.
I surround the cooler with ice or 

133
00:05:58,261 --> 00:05:58,261
surround the bucket with ice.

134
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,240
And I lock it down and I just leave it 
outside for days.

135
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:07,370
She's six days later I opened up and 
it's still got ice in it and really see 

136
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:09,620
that.
That's one that I cook.

137
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,840
Oh man,
that looks good.

138
00:06:11,841 --> 00:06:13,010
Yeah.
Five hours.

139
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:15,350
Two hundred 50 degrees.
How many pounds is that?

140
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,560
That was about,
I wanna say like a three pound one 

141
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,700
somewhere.
She was so good.

142
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,880
Oh my God.
Like you cut like you see all the juices

143
00:06:25,881 --> 00:06:27,360
at the bottom of that plate?
Yeah.

144
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,990
It's like you cut into and it's just 
squirting in your face.

145
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,900
It's so good.
So good.

146
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:37,280
Jesus know that is wild.
Wild Ham.

147
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:42,310
So that's my warning.
The apocalypse is what you're going to 

148
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:42,310
live on.
Well my point is that those yeti coolers

149
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,480
can keep things cold for a really long 
time.

150
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,090
So like you could have like if you have 
frozen meat,

151
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,340
it'll stay frozen in those things for a 
week.

152
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:54,420
Right.
Or at least cold enough where you don't 

153
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,320
have to worry about it going bad.
So you can keep all your stuff in there.

154
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:59,500
So I have meat that'll last for a week 
of like a week of meat and then okay,

155
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,880
generator.
I have a generator,

156
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:05,990
I'm going solar though I'm turning my 
whole house or I think I am as well.

157
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:11,020
It's crazy to not in California.
I know it's you have to drop pretty good

158
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:12,530
cash at the beginning.
Yes.

159
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,090
It'll take about five years to get it 
back.

160
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,460
You might not ever get it back.
I might not ever.

161
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:21,730
You can have it set up where you're 
always going to have power and you're 

162
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:22,820
completely off the grid.
Right.

163
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,090
That's the big thing.
Which Brian Cowen has been trying to get

164
00:07:26,091 --> 00:07:30,020
them to turn over to his soul and he 
says they're really resistant.

165
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,700
Yeah.
He paid for panels.

166
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,140
He had the whole thing set up and he's 
like,

167
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,850
it's really interesting.
He's like,

168
00:07:34,851 --> 00:07:37,620
they make it super difficult for you to 
do this because they,

169
00:07:37,621 --> 00:07:40,130
they're fighting the uh,
the solar companies,

170
00:07:40,131 --> 00:07:43,490
they don't want them to be autonomous.
They don't want people to be autonomous.

171
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:48,670
They also want you to be connected to 
the grid if you choose to remove 

172
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,150
yourself from the grid and be just a 100
percent solar.

173
00:07:50,151 --> 00:07:52,170
It's a huge issue.
Yep.

174
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,900
Very hard to get done.
So Ken,

175
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,810
has he cut off completely but he's not 
not.

176
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,480
So you'll pay like a couple cents a 
month just to stay on.

177
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,440
I don't know.
I don't know.

178
00:08:00,441 --> 00:08:03,200
You'd have to talk to Brian,
but for for the longest time,

179
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,750
I don't know if he's gotten it turned 
over,

180
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:07,760
but for the longest time they weren't 
turning it over.

181
00:08:07,761 --> 00:08:11,210
Like I'm talking about six months.
So he makes a sizable investment.

182
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:16,210
Spent tens of thousands of dollars and 
there's all this equipment installed in 

183
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:16,820
his yard and they wouldn't turn it on.
He's like,

184
00:08:16,821 --> 00:08:21,821
I couldn't get them to turn it on.
I have a tesla and I want to go solar.

185
00:08:23,061 --> 00:08:27,230
So it's the car so completely.
But the battery,

186
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:30,020
the charger,
you can get a rebate off of this thing.

187
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:35,350
The amount of paperwork you have to show
the city of La for them to give you $700

188
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:39,230
back is you have to take pictures of 
your house,

189
00:08:39,231 --> 00:08:43,280
pictures of the charger,
receipts from the company.

190
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,440
Uh,
certificates of work,

191
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,790
things from the panel.
I mean,

192
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,520
it's a list of like 12 things.
It's like,

193
00:08:49,521 --> 00:08:50,030
you know,
and uh,

194
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,670
I,
if I have to go to the,

195
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:55,190
to the mailbox once with the right 
stamp,

196
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,660
like it's going to take weeks for me to 
pull that off.

197
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,870
Your comment,
I'm not,

198
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,030
I'm not doing it.

199
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:00,930
I'm like,
all right.

200
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,300
I guess going to play ball.
Yeah.

201
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:06,090
They make you do $700 worth of work.
Yeah.

202
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,920
Your $700,
where exactly you would think they would

203
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,320
be the opposite.
You'd think they'd be.

204
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,860
No,
you think that they would encourage it 

205
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,141
because it would ease the grid.
I rented a Tesl for a day because we 

206
00:09:18,181 --> 00:09:21,000
have a sponsor,
it's called Skirt as k,

207
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:22,950
U R T,
and they're real new,

208
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,490
but what they're doing is they're 
essentially like uber for rental cars.

209
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,100
So like say if you were outside the 
comedy store and you're like,

210
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,210
hey,
I need a rental car,

211
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:35,230
I want to drive to San Francisco,
they'll fucking show up in 20 minutes 

212
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,230
with a rental car and you'd take that 
bitch and drive it up to coast.

213
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,430
She's,
it's crazy.

214
00:09:38,431 --> 00:09:38,950
Yeah.
You,

215
00:09:38,951 --> 00:09:43,951
you,
you have an application or on your 

216
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:43,951
phone,
right?

217
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:46,761
You use the APP,
you order up a car and you can get a 

218
00:09:46,761 --> 00:09:46,761
tesla.

219
00:09:46,761 --> 00:09:46,761
So I said,
okay,

220
00:09:46,761 --> 00:09:47,790
I want to try this service out before we
do it.

221
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:50,400
Let's get me a tesla.
So I got a tesla.

222
00:09:50,401 --> 00:09:52,710
It was fucking services excellence.
Show up.

223
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,810
They give you the thing,
they give you the key that you do.

224
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:55,710
You know how to do it.
I said,

225
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,880
yeah,
I watched a couple videos.

226
00:09:56,881 --> 00:09:58,200
I'm good to go.
Okay.

227
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:02,560
It's real strange because the tesla 
doesn't start now and that's a,

228
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,700
that's a weird one for people.
You get in it,

229
00:10:05,701 --> 00:10:06,120
you go,
okay.

230
00:10:06,121 --> 00:10:08,520
Why isn't it starting?
There is no revenue gas.

231
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,960
There's no gas,
no brum,

232
00:10:09,961 --> 00:10:10,940
brum,
brum,

233
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,630
brum at all.
No.

234
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,570
And it just sort of,
you put it in drive and okay we're going

235
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,600
o k,
but what got me was how quick the 

236
00:10:20,971 --> 00:10:22,470
battery drained.
I was like,

237
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,360
Ooh,
oh,

238
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,200
like this.
How quick did it train?

239
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,130
Well I live out here.

240
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,680
You were just about half hour to the 
Improv.

241
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:33,060
I drove all the way the Improv back.
I drove here home,

242
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:38,900
back to the Improv and back home and 
then back here and it was more than a 

243
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,290
half a tank.
More than half.

244
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,520
More than half gone.
I'm like,

245
00:10:41,521 --> 00:10:44,090
that's not 240 miles.
Like that's.

246
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,020
But that's half.
That's 1:20

247
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:46,950
in the.
But it's not even,

248
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:52,250
it's not even,
it's maybe 60 miles where the driving 

249
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:52,250
maybe.
Were you punching it?

250
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,860
You must have been because it's a fast.
I don't think I drive any other way to 

251
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:02,051
do it.
There is a big difference when you're 

252
00:11:02,051 --> 00:11:03,861
slamming it was like a thing and yeah,
it shows you like the sweet spot and 

253
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:07,830
that's around probably around 65.
It's ground grantee level.

254
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,420
But man,
when you clash that thing,

255
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,190
yeah,
it's crazy.

256
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:16,310
But it eats up the juice.
But it's weird how it accelerates 

257
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:20,571
without gears,
which is very hard for people who have 

258
00:11:20,571 --> 00:11:21,570
driven a regular car to comprehend,
but it just,

259
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,660
it's instant on.
So like a golf cart,

260
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:28,620
like a Mongo golf cart,
the golf cart.

261
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,930
It's fun.
Even going from zero to 30 5:40.

262
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,900
Yeah.
Just to get that punch.

263
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,090
It's a wonderful car.
It's amazing.

264
00:11:36,091 --> 00:11:40,860
What they've done is amazing.
I came here from down around Wilsher,

265
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,610
like Beverly Hills area.
Get on the four or five,

266
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:49,820
hit autopilot and I didn't steer until I
got off of shut the fuck one-on-one.

267
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,320
Shut the fuck up.
I didn't touch the brake.

268
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:53,980
I

269
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,770
didn't touch the accelerator.
I didn't steer.

270
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,350
We taxing.
I looked at a text.

271
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:06,190
I looked at a text that freaks me out,
man.

272
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,420
It drives better than I do.
What is it doing?

273
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:14,430
Is it?
It's got a camera and it's scanning the 

274
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:14,430
environment.
Cameras and sensors.

275
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:15,850
So it's on the.
On the dashboard,

276
00:12:15,851 --> 00:12:19,150
it'll show the two lines that are picked
up visually.

277
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,720
It'll pick up the speed based on a sign.
And then it has cars,

278
00:12:25,841 --> 00:12:29,350
shadow cars around you.
It's reading all the cars around you,

279
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,970
Jesus,
and it just,

280
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,290
it just goes.
You said it at the,

281
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:39,390
at the speed,
like control and it just breaks and if 

282
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:43,591
you want to change lanes,
just hit the directional and if it 

283
00:12:43,591 --> 00:12:43,591
thinks it's safe,
it'll change lanes for you.

284
00:12:43,591 --> 00:12:43,990
Well,
my,

285
00:12:43,991 --> 00:12:44,580
uh,
I have,

286
00:12:44,581 --> 00:12:46,270
uh,
one of those Lexus Suv.

287
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:51,460
Yeah.
And it'll accelerate and decelerate 

288
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:51,460
depending upon the traffic.

289
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:54,130
So it has a laser sensor and it gives 
you options.

290
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:58,900
Like you could ride someone's ass and 
it'll do it that way or you could spread

291
00:12:58,901 --> 00:13:00,890
it out whereas like four cars in front 
of you,

292
00:13:00,891 --> 00:13:05,891
it starts to break,
which is the way I have it set up 

293
00:13:05,891 --> 00:13:05,891
because I don't think it doesn't break 
that good.

294
00:13:05,891 --> 00:13:09,010
It's a giant ass truck right in traffic.
It's pretty great.

295
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,030
Like when I take my kids to school,
I'll hop on the one on one and I'll,

296
00:13:13,031 --> 00:13:15,730
uh,
to not have to deal with the braking,

297
00:13:15,731 --> 00:13:18,340
stopping going.
That part is just sweet.

298
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,210
Yeah,
it's awesome.

299
00:13:19,211 --> 00:13:24,211
It's really great.
I mean they say a car insurance 

300
00:13:24,211 --> 00:13:26,380
companies are getting ready for the 
collapse of their business.

301
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,690
Good.
They say once everything is automated,

302
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,690
they think this is the insurance 
companies talking,

303
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:34,930
that it's gonna be an 85 percent 
decrease in accidents.

304
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:40,860
That's how much better the car and I 
know the car is a better driver than I 

305
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,950
am.
No more conscious,

306
00:13:41,951 --> 00:13:46,951
sees more was long as you have the 
option to be autonomous on a country 

307
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,310
road,
you know,

308
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:53,340
as long as you get on a country road and
you could just fucking zoom around and 

309
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,900
drive and see things.
You mean do it on your own?

310
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,120
Yeah.
Because when you get on those roads,

311
00:13:58,121 --> 00:14:03,121
like I put it on autopilot,
go into the comedy store and I go from 

312
00:14:03,121 --> 00:14:06,130
Sherman oaks,
Sherman Hooks over Laurel,

313
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:09,220
Laurel Canyon's,
wavy gravy and weird turns and people.

314
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:12,500
And it's,
it's a little nerve wracking.

315
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:15,940
So when you're doing that,
so you're doing all those turns.

316
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:19,800
It's doing it completely by itself on 
Laurel to appoint.

317
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,390
Oh No,
I don't like that to a point.

318
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,400
That's what I'm saying.
That's the scary.

319
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,390
That's the scary part.

320
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,670
So was,
it doesn't really cause you know Laurel,

321
00:14:27,671 --> 00:14:29,800
it's old road that you can't read the 
lines.

322
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,440
There's a lot of weirdness going on.
You can't.

323
00:14:32,441 --> 00:14:37,441
I've tried it,
especially when you come back down 

324
00:14:37,441 --> 00:14:39,691
towards Ventura and there's like that 
really whipping turns that you don't 

325
00:14:39,691 --> 00:14:43,891
want to just let the car do it.
Maybe it's going to be one of those 

326
00:14:43,891 --> 00:14:46,351
things where they're going to be forced 
to have to Redo the roads to deal with 

327
00:14:46,351 --> 00:14:46,351
these electric cars that have to read 
the centers.

328
00:14:46,351 --> 00:14:51,120
Maybe the other thing is I think the 
technology is going to be gps driven 

329
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,120
also,
so

330
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:57,130
that'll help if it syncs up that way the
government can just fucking shut you 

331
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:00,671
down and pull you over.
They get exterminate you if you do 

332
00:15:00,671 --> 00:15:00,671
anything wrong.
Well,

333
00:15:00,671 --> 00:15:00,671
you know,
that's the.

334
00:15:00,671 --> 00:15:03,530
That's the grand conspiracy theory about
Michael Hastings.

335
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,860
Do you know Michael Hastings is.
Michael Hastings is a journalist.

336
00:15:06,861 --> 00:15:11,861
He wrote an article for rolling stone 
about a general who was involved in the 

337
00:15:11,861 --> 00:15:14,480
war and he was embedded and while he was
embedded over there,

338
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:18,380
just coincidentally it was when they had
that big Icelandic volcano.

339
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,060
Remember that?
Icelandic volcano?

340
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,140
Yeah.
Well,

341
00:15:21,141 --> 00:15:23,990
it globally crippled flights for a long 
time.

342
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,670
I remember that all through Europe.
Yeah,

343
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:30,700
so he was stuck over there for I wanna 
say like an extra month and when he was 

344
00:15:30,921 --> 00:15:35,921
stuck over there,
they got a little too coffee with this 

345
00:15:35,921 --> 00:15:37,820
guy and they started cracking a bunch of
jokes about vice president Biden,

346
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,510
who's that?

347
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:44,150
The soldiers and the general,
and I don't remember,

348
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:49,180
mcallister was at Mcalester,
which whichever general believe it's 

349
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:53,230
mcallister.
He had to step down after the article 

350
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,100
came out because the article was just 
absolutely brutal and it was devastating

351
00:15:55,101 --> 00:16:00,101
and so this,
this Michael Hastings character started 

352
00:16:00,101 --> 00:16:02,750
receiving some serious tangible death 
threats that like,

353
00:16:02,751 --> 00:16:07,751
you're a dead motherfucker,
like we're going to find you like you 

354
00:16:07,751 --> 00:16:08,480
just,
you just cost American lives because you

355
00:16:08,481 --> 00:16:13,481
just got rid of one of the best generals
ever because you don't think it's 

356
00:16:13,611 --> 00:16:17,000
politically correct that this guy jokes 
around about a guy like Joe Biden who is

357
00:16:17,001 --> 00:16:18,920
obviously a fucking goof,
right?

358
00:16:18,921 --> 00:16:23,921
Joe Biden's a group,
he's a goof and if you don't think he's 

359
00:16:23,921 --> 00:16:23,921
a goof wise in the running for 
president,

360
00:16:23,921 --> 00:16:24,470
you know,
why isn't he running?

361
00:16:24,471 --> 00:16:26,210
Ladies and gentlemen,
who were a bunch of reasons.

362
00:16:26,211 --> 00:16:28,430
One of them,
Joe Biden was a plagiarist,

363
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:33,460
like Joe Biden when I was in Boston at 
stitches comedy club in 1988 weeks back 

364
00:16:34,071 --> 00:16:36,830
when he was running for president,
but he had abandoned his,

365
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:42,160
his campaign because they found his 
speeches were just gigantic chunks of 

366
00:16:42,891 --> 00:16:44,380
President Kennedy speech and snap.

367
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,610
Yes.
Still from Kennedy,

368
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:49,100
Kennedy.
Nobody knew back before the Internet.

369
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,260
Nobody knew that you couldn't get away 
with shit like that crazy.

370
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:55,910
But he got away with it because of 
actual political scholars who are like,

371
00:16:55,911 --> 00:16:56,840
Hey,
fuck head.

372
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:01,610
I know that fucking speech.
So we at stitches had Joe Biden tonight.

373
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,830
We would do Joe Biden tonight.
What do you mean?

374
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,540
Well,
we would steal each other's shit.

375
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,430
Ah,
like if you went up,

376
00:17:07,431 --> 00:17:09,640
you would do my act and I would try to 
remember your at.

377
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,550
We would try to remember each other.
It was great.

378
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,510
That's got to be fun.
Yeah,

379
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:13,380
it was,
um,

380
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:17,390
Kevin Fitzgerald,
who the hell did I forget who?

381
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:22,730
Forget the comic who started it,
but either way it's a great idea.

382
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,830
That's how much of a plagiarist he was.
Never heard that.

383
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:30,850
Yeah,
he was so well they keep the Democratic 

384
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:30,850
Party,
keeps it under wraps now,

385
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,020
but it was a big story in 88.
So what happened with this?

386
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,230
So he started getting death threats 
because he was talking shit about him,

387
00:17:36,231 --> 00:17:41,231
started getting some serious death 
threats because this guy was a love 

388
00:17:41,231 --> 00:17:44,921
general,
very respected by these people who 

389
00:17:44,921 --> 00:17:44,921
worked for him,
including soldiers,

390
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:49,990
including Spec ops guys and all these 
people who looked at this Michael 

391
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:50,010
Hastings.
I like you piece of fucking

392
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:55,010
shit anyway,
and he's just a guy just to replace the 

393
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:55,500
report just to report,
but a snarky little fuck,

394
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:00,740
you know,
let's do an adderall and a bunch of 

395
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:00,740
other shit.
He was a little cocky.

396
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:04,310
Anyway,
this guy drove a 120 miles an hour 

397
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:08,991
without hitting the brakes into a tree 
on sunset and died under very suspicious

398
00:18:09,241 --> 00:18:10,950
circumstances.
Not only that,

399
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:16,070
he was telling people that if he dies 
like you should understand that they 

400
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:20,541
killed me.
Really not going to kill myself if I 

401
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:20,541
die,
just know this.

402
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:24,980
They killed me.
And when military experts who understand

403
00:18:25,141 --> 00:18:29,130
what's possible today comes to 
automating vehicles.

404
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,560
Yeah.
They say it's absolutely possible.

405
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,010
Absolutely.
People are hacking into commander cars.

406
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,740
These cars like your crying that can 
drive itself.

407
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,990
Yeah.
Like this is a Mercedes and the Mercedes

408
00:18:39,991 --> 00:18:42,320
have that same ability.
Yeah.

409
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,970
Especially the new ones do.
I don't know if his did,

410
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
but what they're essentially saying is 
would they could just pin that fucking 

411
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,230
accelerator down,
just lift off that gas,

412
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,240
lift off that break so the break doesn't
work at all,

413
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:59,660
and then disable,
disable the bags and steer that 

414
00:18:59,660 --> 00:18:59,760
motherfucker right into a tree.

415
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,620
Oh,
that's how they kill them.

416
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,990
That's how people think,
right?

417
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,510
Of course,
his family and a lot of other people who

418
00:19:06,511 --> 00:19:08,460
are close to them,
they don't want to say anything.

419
00:19:08,461 --> 00:19:10,770
They're probably terrified and they say,
no,

420
00:19:10,771 --> 00:19:12,300
we believe it was suicide,
you know?

421
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:12,590
And,
but,

422
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:15,360
but the people who knew knew him outside
of his family,

423
00:19:15,361 --> 00:19:16,800
like,
that is nonsense,

424
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,750
isn't it?
So it's,

425
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:22,980
it's a credible conspiracy because 
you're talking about a guy who,

426
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:28,070
through his article,
like the rolling stone article was 

427
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:30,090
devastating to the military.
It's really devastating to.

428
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:33,840
Wasn't mcallister to the point where 
general has to step down.

429
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:38,900
Stanley McChrystal hastings and crystal 
crystal profiled the CIA director.

430
00:19:39,751 --> 00:19:40,830
John Brennan.
Yes,

431
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,790
yes,
yes.

432
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,680
Okay.
And yeah,

433
00:19:43,681 --> 00:19:48,681
he was working on a pro,
another fucking expos day of the CIA 

434
00:19:48,681 --> 00:19:52,071
director Jesus fucking Christ.
So it was really interesting.

435
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:55,650
What was really interesting and um,
you know,

436
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:01,700
I just have to be worried about someone 
being in the audience of the comedy 

437
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,660
store and like he's a hack and they take
out their cell phone and make me go into

438
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:07,230
a tree on Laurel,
like the CIA is not going to care.

439
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:10,480
But in angry audience member.
Well that's.

440
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:14,580
He fucked with.
What was the general's name?

441
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:18,240
Stanley McChrystal.
Mcchrystal McChrystal and the CIA.

442
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,620
Yes.
Yeah,

443
00:20:19,621 --> 00:20:24,621
I mean it was a double whammy of fuck 
ups and it's almost like they wanted to 

444
00:20:24,621 --> 00:20:24,621
see what they get away with.
Like,

445
00:20:24,621 --> 00:20:25,710
let's see,
we haven't used this shit.

446
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,350
Let's try to use this shit stateside.
Oh man,

447
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,560
this motherfucker nutri because got to 
be able to be.

448
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:34,110
Because when someone riding a snarky 
article like that,

449
00:20:34,111 --> 00:20:37,440
I mean I don't know what actually was 
said or I didn't read the article,

450
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:42,680
but apparently it was very disturbing to
the people that were involved there and 

451
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:47,181
what he had decided to do with this 
article from their point of view was 

452
00:20:47,181 --> 00:20:50,290
take a very inflammatory position.
The he tried to,

453
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:55,320
you know,
manipulate it and make it very negative 

454
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:55,320
and you know,
they,

455
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,710
they can do things like that if they 
writing an article about it,

456
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,940
if they read your article about you.

457
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,410
Well,
it's amazing.

458
00:20:59,411 --> 00:21:03,850
I mean when you think about just 
technology and I'm so excited about this

459
00:21:03,851 --> 00:21:04,900
car,
I'm so excited.

460
00:21:04,901 --> 00:21:06,680
What it can do.
It's amazing what we're.

461
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,800
All this stuff is going.
You just talking about that service.

462
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:13,801
We'll just bring it a rental car to.
I mean it's all and it's moving so 

463
00:21:13,801 --> 00:21:17,311
quickly and so great.
But I tend to only think of all these 

464
00:21:17,311 --> 00:21:17,380
positive,
cool,

465
00:21:17,381 --> 00:21:20,350
fun things that you can do with it.
You know,

466
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:25,830
the evil guy,
the evildoers it can use that same 

467
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:26,680
stuff.
And then some.

468
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,560
I mean,
in their mind,

469
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,950
they might not even be the evildoers he 
might be a real problem.

470
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,710
Right.
You know,

471
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,760
I mean,
he might be in their eyes and enemy of 

472
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:36,760
America,
I don't know who's right,

473
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:41,560
but if he really did interrupt some 
military operations at cost soldiers 

474
00:21:42,351 --> 00:21:47,351
their lives because the general wasn't 
there anymore because he had to step 

475
00:21:47,351 --> 00:21:48,770
down and it fucked up the entire chain 
of leadership.

476
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:54,800
Tevye and he was talking about in that 
same article that Jamie put up that he 

477
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,340
was around,
he was,

478
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:59,360
whenever he was around people who kill 
people for a living,

479
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,820
they would invariably tell him we're 
going to kill you.

480
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,100
Like it wasn't.
It wasn't,

481
00:22:04,101 --> 00:22:06,110
uh,
a couple people that were saying this to

482
00:22:06,111 --> 00:22:11,111
him.
Like there was several people there 

483
00:22:11,111 --> 00:22:11,111
saying,
hey motherfucker,

484
00:22:11,111 --> 00:22:11,111
you're dead.
Just so you know,

485
00:22:11,111 --> 00:22:11,900
we're all,
we're all going to kill you.

486
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,390
So this guy,
what did he do?

487
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,100
He doubled down when,
after the CIA,

488
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:16,640
afterwards,

489
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,860
God balls the balls on the.

490
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:24,920
This young man,
he tested positive when he died for 

491
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:24,920
crystal meth.
He did,

492
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:24,920
yeah,
it had,

493
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,540
um,
um,

494
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:29,400
verify that just to be sure that he had 
had a,

495
00:22:29,401 --> 00:22:33,570
an issue with drugs in the past.
Apparently from all this stuff that I've

496
00:22:33,571 --> 00:22:36,180
read and uh,
they thought he'd kicked it,

497
00:22:36,181 --> 00:22:38,760
but you know,
death threats will fucking get you right

498
00:22:38,761 --> 00:22:43,761
back on the wagon or off.
It doesn't work on the line and I'll 

499
00:22:43,761 --> 00:22:45,420
have them off the wagon or do they plant
that on him?

500
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,070
Well,
it's easy for him.

501
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:50,400
It's his body.
It may or may not have been real.

502
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:55,460
Who knows?
And it also that stuff a crystal meth 

503
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,960
and adderall are so closely related.
They're,

504
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,960
they're almost the same thing really.
Yeah.

505
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,520
Yeah.
Adderall is very,

506
00:23:02,521 --> 00:23:04,800
very similar to Crystal Bailey.
Yeah.

507
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:06,430
She's,
well,

508
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:09,270
it's just a,
a nice healthy dose,

509
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,250
right?
We don't have to worry about dying.

510
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:16,490
Right.
Or running down sunset with no pants on 

511
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:16,530
or you know,
you'll,

512
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,690
you'll get productive instead of 
destructive.

513
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,250
Productive and destructive are next door
neighbors when you're on adderall.

514
00:23:23,251 --> 00:23:23,700
Apparently.

515
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:29,010
God,
that was the scary thing when they were 

516
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:29,010
talking during the Republican debate 
about how,

517
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:33,120
how much heroin is in New Hampshire,
how it just nobody,

518
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:37,800
not one person brought up prescription 
drugs cause the lead into that.

519
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,640
Well,
they can not.

520
00:23:38,641 --> 00:23:39,870
One,
they can't.

521
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:42,690
There's just too much money.

522
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:47,780
Yeah,
it's the pharmaceutical companies have 

523
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:47,780
been bought and sold.

524
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,590
It's a criminal.
It's a criminal business.

525
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:52,910
The whole business is entirely criminal 
as far as politics,

526
00:23:52,911 --> 00:23:55,760
the business of politics,
the way they get money and what they can

527
00:23:55,761 --> 00:23:58,280
and can't say otherwise.
They would be talking about cigarettes.

528
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:03,790
Cigarettes kill a half a million people 
in America alone every year still.

529
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,730
Yeah,
still.

530
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,310
Yeah.
Does.

531
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,530
It's not changing like dropped off a 
little bit,

532
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,700
you know,
with education.

533
00:24:10,701 --> 00:24:12,860
But yeah,
people are fucking dumb man.

534
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,570
They,
they want those things in their mouth.

535
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:19,690
It's amazing,
isn't it true you ever tried smoking 

536
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:24,430
once as a kid we were walking down the 
street and we saw a lit cigarette.

537
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:27,110
Someone who must just put it out of the 
car.

538
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:32,650
I was just walking with my two buddies.
I picked up a cigarette and imagine if 

539
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:35,390
that's how you got herpes,
be such a memorandum cigarette.

540
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,070
I coughed so much.

541
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:42,070
It was like that is all and it was like 
probably 11 and that was it.

542
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:43,130
I was just like,
no,

543
00:24:43,131 --> 00:24:45,130
I'm not going to smoke.
It was good for you.

544
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,120
It was just a lucky break,
you know?

545
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,840
I smoked with my sister when I was 15 
and she was 14.

546
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:55,990
I tried it and she tried it.
She kept smoking until she was in her 

547
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:55,990
forties.
I think it really,

548
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:58,490
I think thirties,
late thirties maybe.

549
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:02,630
I never smoked again.
I just know this is ridiculous.

550
00:25:02,631 --> 00:25:04,700
It just seemed.
I like the idea of it.

551
00:25:04,701 --> 00:25:08,570
I like holding something I like a lot of
times when I'm out with friends,

552
00:25:08,571 --> 00:25:10,940
let's have like a roll up of Napkin or 
something and just.

553
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,500
I just like the authority of it.
It looks cool as fuck.

554
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:16,130
It looks good.
It's the coolest.

555
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:21,320
Oh,
just come out of a show and just light 

556
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:21,320
up by yourself in the,
in the hallway.

557
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:26,020
You know what's funny?
When cigarette smokers looked down on 

558
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:26,020
cigar smokers like,
fuck off.

559
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:28,280
I love cigars.
Cigars are great,

560
00:25:28,281 --> 00:25:33,281
but it's funny when someone lights up a 
cigar around someone to smoke 

561
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:34,120
cigarettes,
they'll be like disgusting.

562
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,350
Like,
oh my God.

563
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:36,680
You know what,
those fucking cigarettes.

564
00:25:36,681 --> 00:25:37,490
You smoke.
Smell A.

565
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,750
Yeah.
The worst.

566
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:40,310
The best is pipes.
Pipe,

567
00:25:40,311 --> 00:25:40,940
smell.
Great.

568
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,760
Know pipes really?
I know.

569
00:25:43,761 --> 00:25:46,790
Pipe smell good because that doesn't 
offend my family,

570
00:25:46,791 --> 00:25:48,980
which is all girl.
That's interesting.

571
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:49,910
Yeah.
They're like,

572
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:50,990
oh,
that's not so bad.

573
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,490
Oh,
forget it.

574
00:25:52,491 --> 00:25:56,360
I can be in the backyard.
Shut all the windows blown.

575
00:25:56,361 --> 00:26:00,050
I might sound with a cigar and someone's
going to pop their head out of a window.

576
00:26:00,051 --> 00:26:04,470
You're disgusting.
Yeah.

577
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:09,550
I love a nice cigars.
A cigar over here from Michael Dowd.

578
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,360
These are from there.
Probably dried out.

579
00:26:12,361 --> 00:26:14,990
Now I got to get a human to remind me 
again about a human.

580
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,380
Got a humidor at home.
I got to bring it here.

581
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:17,640
Yeah,
I got this from.

582
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,730
Did you ever see the documentary?
The seven five now.

583
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,710
Nick Depaulo told me about it.
Oh yeah.

584
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:25,230
Holy Shit.
The seven,

585
00:26:25,231 --> 00:26:26,070
five,
seven.

586
00:26:26,071 --> 00:26:31,071
Five is about the seven,
five precinct in New York City and it 

587
00:26:31,071 --> 00:26:35,661
was in the seventies,
the eighties rather during the crack 

588
00:26:35,661 --> 00:26:35,661
epidemic.
Oh yeah.

589
00:26:35,661 --> 00:26:36,690
Holy Shit.
Oh really?

590
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:41,810
What a fucking crazy documentary.
And Michael Dowd was one of the corrupt 

591
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,010
cops that was in it,
in went to jail for

592
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:44,910
a long time,
the whole deal,

593
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,570
but then got out and then they did this 
documentary and he did my podcast.

594
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,650
Oh really?
Yeah,

595
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:54,651
and he brought in some cigar.
So he's having made if that's his 

596
00:26:54,651 --> 00:26:57,081
business now.
Well he's doing a bunch of different 

597
00:26:57,081 --> 00:26:57,081
things.
You just kind of hustling.

598
00:26:57,081 --> 00:26:57,081
It's hard.
It's just got A.

599
00:26:57,081 --> 00:26:59,850
I mean he was in jail for a long time 
and tried to put his life back in order.

600
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:05,120
She's just got caught up in all the 
money and oh well it was 20 something 

601
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,051
years old.
He was young and all the cops are 

602
00:27:09,051 --> 00:27:11,181
corrupt.
He like the first day on the job they 

603
00:27:11,181 --> 00:27:14,271
were explaining to him about a guy who 
quote on quote jumped off of a roof and 

604
00:27:15,151 --> 00:27:16,890
it was because this guy had ratted on 
cops.

605
00:27:16,891 --> 00:27:18,800
He was like,
that's what happens when you ran on cops

606
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:19,210
that.

607
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,620
Got It.
We're good.

608
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:27,380
We're good.
One of the elite the first week or 

609
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,230
something that he was working,
but he was like.

610
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:33,060
It was really real clear.
Real early on there's a giant percentage

611
00:27:33,061 --> 00:27:35,670
of guys are on the take and that's just 
how you made money.

612
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,040
So where does he get the tobacco?
I don't know.

613
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:41,100
I don't think they're made in the 
Dominican Republic.

614
00:27:41,101 --> 00:27:46,101
He's got a friend that he used to do 
quote unquote business with back during 

615
00:27:46,101 --> 00:27:47,640
the cocaine days that he's pals with 
visits.

616
00:27:47,641 --> 00:27:49,790
I think that's where he's getting.
Yeah,

617
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,130
I got a bunch of Cuban cigars.
Cohibas.

618
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,480
Ooh,
Nice.

619
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,100
It really is a difference.
Yeah.

620
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,770
The other visitors to get the real,
the real deal.

621
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:00,660
You got to make sure you get real ones.
Yeah.

622
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:02,320
There's a lot of fucking counterfeit 
cube.

623
00:28:02,321 --> 00:28:06,000
There's a lot of fake.
He's going to open up now though soon,

624
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,060
but they don't have enough quantity like
the.

625
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:13,260
I forget the name of the area where they
grow.

626
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:17,250
There's this area specific era via whole
trabaho or something like that.

627
00:28:17,251 --> 00:28:22,251
I forget what it's called,
but it's a very small area where they 

628
00:28:22,251 --> 00:28:25,761
grow the best cigars and the soil is 
like incredibly rich and they've been 

629
00:28:25,761 --> 00:28:30,740
tilling the soil and taking care of it 
in a very specific way for decades and 

630
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:35,630
decades and they just know what they're 
doing and now America's coming in and 

631
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,780
wants to devour it.
Yeah,

632
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:37,840
right.
I mean,

633
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,690
because they do sell them around the 
rest of the world.

634
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,820
I used to get them from England.
Oh yeah.

635
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,710
I used to get them sent to me from 
England.

636
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,870
Allegedly.
Allegedly.

637
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,050
It's not legal.
No.

638
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:52,700
They would send them to me and then like
a couple weeks later they would send me 

639
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:56,151
the bands so they would send them with 
like Dominican bands and then you'd take

640
00:28:56,461 --> 00:28:58,890
them off and then they'd send you the,
the actual real,

641
00:28:59,060 --> 00:28:59,500
you know?

642
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:04,550
Yeah.
My friend a Gad Al-Mulla that French 

643
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:04,550
comedian.
No,

644
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,090
it's like the biggest comedian in 
France.

645
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:11,540
And uh,
I told him that I had gotten a little 

646
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,690
while ago that I had a Cuban cigar.
He's like,

647
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,440
no,
you don't.

648
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:14,760
I was like,
yeah,

649
00:29:14,761 --> 00:29:16,260
I got them in touch with.
Did you get them?

650
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,670
I said,
my buddy got.

651
00:29:17,671 --> 00:29:20,910
I'm from Vegas and he knows a guy who 
knows a guy like Tom.

652
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:24,390
I'm telling you,
Americans do not get the Cuban cigars.

653
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:29,690
I will bring you some that we have in 
France and then he brought some stuff 

654
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:31,320
from France and I couldn't really tell 
if it was different,

655
00:29:31,321 --> 00:29:34,500
but he.
His point was Cuban will deal with us.

656
00:29:34,501 --> 00:29:36,630
What you're getting is just rehashed 
horseshit.

657
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,420
You definitely can get.
I mean,

658
00:29:39,421 --> 00:29:40,050
yeah,
you can.

659
00:29:40,051 --> 00:29:43,510
I think the ones I have now or are we 
are legit maybe.

660
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:44,530
I think so.

661
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:46,900
The only way to really know is to get 
them from Cuba.

662
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,850
Yeah.
And even then you don't know,

663
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,760
right?
They can be shipping them from Dominican

664
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,760
Republic to Cuba,
boxing of being Cuba with their own 

665
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:56,760
wrappers and sending them right to you 
to save money.

666
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,460
Yeah.
You're right.

667
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,960
I mean once people realize that there's 
so much money in America now.

668
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:08,110
Yeah,
I still don't think you can just go hog 

669
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:08,920
wild on by like 50 boxes of them.
I think there's a limitation on how much

670
00:30:08,921 --> 00:30:11,770
you're allowed to import.
I went to Canada,

671
00:30:11,771 --> 00:30:12,740
I went to a,
uh,

672
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,360
to a warehouse guy that dealt with Cuba 
and then he would sell them to the 

673
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,810
stores in Canada,
so it was all through the government and

674
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:24,820
pr and legit and stuff and that was 
pretty trippy just walking through a 

675
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,940
warehouse of all heaven.
Humidity control.

676
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,500
Yeah.
Perfect.

677
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:30,970
It's interesting how they have to do 
that.

678
00:30:30,971 --> 00:30:35,971
Right?
They have to like keep the cigars at a 

679
00:30:35,971 --> 00:30:36,040
certain level of humidity,
but once they do that,

680
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:37,760
they last forever.
Yeah.

681
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,750
And you can bring them back to like,
if you get,

682
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:44,810
if this is dry and you have,
you just literally come back apparently 

683
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:44,910
a couple times.
Is that it?

684
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:46,990
Yeah.
After a while they just turned to shit.

685
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,870
You got to be careful of mold to.
They can get mold.

686
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,960
Where do you smoke your cigarettes?
Where the fuck I want in your house?

687
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:55,240
I'm a man top.
I do whatever the fuck I want.

688
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,600
Your no outside go outside.
I could do it in my office but open up 

689
00:31:00,681 --> 00:31:01,940
the window.
Yeah.

690
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:06,070
And to have some fucking sophisticated 
methods of ventilation.

691
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:11,330
Yeah.
Let God do they hate it or if you just 

692
00:31:13,421 --> 00:31:15,640
come home and it's still on your 
clothes.

693
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,710
I had signs of like,
come on in here.

694
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:22,770
That is going to show you what to do.
I know I'm going to show you what that 

695
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:22,770
dope.
It's not.

696
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:25,420
It really repels every female for miles.
Well,

697
00:31:25,421 --> 00:31:30,421
girls who don't get repelled by it.
I do not trust that fucking scandalous 

698
00:31:32,111 --> 00:31:33,690
bitches.
Smoke.

699
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:35,230
Smoke.
Um,

700
00:31:35,231 --> 00:31:36,510
yes.
Yeah.

701
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,190
Those girls are fucking dangerous.
Girls will shoot.

702
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:41,530
You got a gun in her pussy.

703
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:46,290
Don't trust the.
Oh,

704
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,260
one of those.
Oh,

705
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:51,460
she's one of the guys coming over for 
the superbowl.

706
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,560
Right?
She loves sports too.

707
00:31:53,561 --> 00:31:55,480
Come on.
I don't even have a female friend.

708
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,960
Will when you meet a girl,
doesn't have any female friends.

709
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:03,990
Yikes.
That's like a guy who doesn't have any 

710
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:03,990
guy friends.
Yeah.

711
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:07,560
Ladies,
if you ever have a friend who's a guy 

712
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:07,560
and he doesn't have any guy friends,
that guy's gay.

713
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,250
That's the only answer.
Explanation.

714
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:12,700
It's right to an explanation or he's a 
fucking psycho.

715
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,990
You're psycho.
Yeah.

716
00:32:13,991 --> 00:32:15,890
What kind of a man doesn't know your 
friends?

717
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:19,270
I like hanging out with women.
It's just like being with the girls.

718
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:22,510
Women are real.
The more real plus they talk about shit.

719
00:32:22,511 --> 00:32:27,511
I'm interested in shoes and like what 
they're really saying is I can fool 

720
00:32:27,511 --> 00:32:27,970
them.
Guys know I'm full of Shit.

721
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,530
Yes,
definitely that.

722
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:30,660
Yeah.
Yeah.

723
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:35,190
Male feminists were an asshole.
Fucking the Mazda.

724
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,460
You say that.
Say that again.

725
00:32:36,461 --> 00:32:38,200
Say it again.
I'm on your side.

726
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,980
Yeah,
I'm different

727
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,110
ladies.
He knows a lot of men are just.

728
00:32:42,111 --> 00:32:47,111
They're just rude.
The guy in college with the Acoustic 

729
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,510
Guitar.
Fucking animal house scene.

730
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,190
Yeah,
exactly.

731
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:57,300
That was one of the great scenes in 
unmasking gets fucking fake.

732
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:03,160
Pseudo sensitive autistic behavior,
which by the way ladies is just for 

733
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,940
Pussy.
If we were all camping together,

734
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:08,780
that guy would not break out the guitar.
It wouldn't happen.

735
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:14,220
It happens because girls are around and 
he wants to appear to be being 

736
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,940
insensitive and it's the same as a male 
yoga teacher maybe.

737
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Yeah.
Maybe some guy with his little diaper 

738
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,600
out of that guy.
Well,

739
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:29,800
even better than that.
He had a fucking warehouse filled with 

740
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,080
like Ferrari's and shit and they busted 
him and he said that this was for a.

741
00:33:33,081 --> 00:33:38,081
He was going to start an education 
program for children on automotive 

742
00:33:38,081 --> 00:33:41,910
engineering was the beak room.
Automotive Engineering Center.

743
00:33:41,911 --> 00:33:42,530
I'm not bullshitting.

744
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:45,560
He just got caught with this.
That's hilarious.

745
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,110
They just,
uh,

746
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:52,150
he had to,
he had to pay or he just got a judgment 

747
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:56,471
against him for millions of dollars for 
sexual harassment and fucking with 

748
00:33:56,471 --> 00:33:56,730
people.
Yeah.

749
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,670
He was banging all of them.
Well,

750
00:33:58,671 --> 00:34:00,970
it's not just banging because if you're 
banging all of them,

751
00:34:00,971 --> 00:34:03,200
you see they can't get money from you if
you're banging them,

752
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:04,920
you have to be rude.
But he was,

753
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,170
he got to be rude about it,
you know,

754
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:09,830
if they like you and you're having sex,
you know,

755
00:34:09,831 --> 00:34:11,180
like I want some money.
Well,

756
00:34:11,181 --> 00:34:13,250
what did you like having sex with them?
Yeah,

757
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:18,251
but I feel like I should be getting paid
yoga mogul from mogul being from should 

758
00:34:19,191 --> 00:34:24,191
ne should shouldery must pay almost six 
point $5 million in damages.

759
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,990
There's a photo of him and the yoga 
place that I go to,

760
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:32,120
he's sitting there like in the Lotus 
position on a tiger body,

761
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,660
like a skin tiger with the head.

762
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:36,860
Like a rug.
You can find it.

763
00:34:36,861 --> 00:34:38,540
Yeah.
There's a tiger rug.

764
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,540
It's so retail.
It was always in that diaper.

765
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,450
But what did what kind of mixed signal 
you send him,

766
00:34:43,451 --> 00:34:45,200
motherfucker.
You murdering animals.

767
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,990
You don't even eat tigers,
you know?

768
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,530
This isn't like.
You know what I'm saying?

769
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,950
It's not like,
you know you ate an elk and you have the

770
00:34:51,951 --> 00:34:52,940
horns there.
No,

771
00:34:52,941 --> 00:34:55,250
you don't eat fucking tigers.
Like what are you doing,

772
00:34:55,251 --> 00:34:57,860
man?
Why do you have a skin tiger?

773
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,770
Tiger.
There's the photo.

774
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,920
It's not just one of them because 
that's.

775
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:04,150
That's a different one than the one 
that's in my yoga studio.

776
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:09,490
That hair,
the hair's more offensive than the time 

777
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:12,880
while he was going bald.
So what he did it just grow it long on 

778
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:12,880
the outside.
Did the Ben Franklin.

779
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,220
I'll admit I've thought of it.
Here's the thing about those classes,

780
00:35:16,221 --> 00:35:21,221
men,
there's something about yoga classes 

781
00:35:21,221 --> 00:35:21,920
that are almost inherently sexual.
Yes,

782
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:22,970
there it is.
Central.

783
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:25,760
It's hot,
everyone's in their underwear.

784
00:35:25,761 --> 00:35:27,620
It's definitely that one.
Yeah,

785
00:35:27,621 --> 00:35:30,590
that shot.
It could all those girls look at him and

786
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,590
it's a little and then he brings him in 
and he's like,

787
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,910
you can be a teacher and he wins.
It's a cult.

788
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,410
That's the danger of it.
It's.

789
00:35:36,411 --> 00:35:38,130
He really gets devout

790
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,940
followers and then has sex with amount 
of tiger.

791
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:46,070
Seems like no matter what,
if there's one person that's some sort 

792
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:49,971
of charismatic leader like that,
and then you're doing something 

793
00:35:49,971 --> 00:35:52,680
spiritual like yoga,
someone's gonna run a cult.

794
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:55,920
Yeah,
I've absolutely not all powerful.

795
00:35:55,950 --> 00:36:00,950
Yeah.
Not all of them like to go to a good 

796
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,801
place.
I go to this place in a Gaura and the 

797
00:36:03,801 --> 00:36:04,680
lady who runs it is fantastic.
The group has found a great place,

798
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:07,380
but it's a warm place and I was asking 
her,

799
00:36:07,381 --> 00:36:08,090
I was like,
okay,

800
00:36:08,091 --> 00:36:09,100
Rachel,
like,

801
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,800
uh,
this guy,

802
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,870
speaker guys,
a little fucking shady.

803
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:13,680
Like,
what's the deal?

804
00:36:13,681 --> 00:36:16,410
Yeah,
they say that he's a very good teacher,

805
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,140
but he's an asshole.
That's how everybody looks at it.

806
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,250
I totally get it.
I mean,

807
00:36:23,251 --> 00:36:25,650
it's,
you're surrounded by all these beautiful

808
00:36:25,651 --> 00:36:30,651
women in these sweaty scenarios in a 
certain key to fuck him.

809
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,600
Exactly.
They're tired of her husband.

810
00:36:33,601 --> 00:36:34,480
He's boring.
This guy,

811
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,870
spiritual.
I go this great.

812
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,920
Normally I go to a place in Sherman oaks
called black dog yoga.

813
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:41,550
Oh,
okay.

814
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,670
And heard that place.
It's really good and I've fallen in love

815
00:36:44,671 --> 00:36:49,410
with a couple teachers.
They're no joke and of course you have.

816
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:53,400
There's a couple classes that are lambs.
There's a couple of minuses.

817
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:58,640
They know there's a couple of classes 
that are like right after you drop your 

818
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,430
kids off at school,
like a 9:00

819
00:36:59,431 --> 00:37:04,110
start where it's not like the 6:00,
7:00

820
00:37:04,111 --> 00:37:06,960
at night,
young hard body going,

821
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,740
yes,
their moms.

822
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:12,570
I got a couple of kids or even older.
It's not like you're saying,

823
00:37:12,571 --> 00:37:17,571
okay,
I'm going to do a photo shoot in here 

824
00:37:17,571 --> 00:37:17,571
for whatever magazine.
You know what I mean?

825
00:37:17,571 --> 00:37:17,571
It's just,
you know,

826
00:37:17,571 --> 00:37:18,780
regular,
regular looking people.

827
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:24,940
You go to that class for a couple months
and you start seeing the same people 

828
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:24,940
over and over again.

829
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,910
Everybody starts looking really 
attractive.

830
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,910
So it is essential practice.
It is a,

831
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,010
there's a thing to it.
It's hot.

832
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,290
It's hot and wet and everyone's naked.
Yeah.

833
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,260
I keep my shirt on.
Do you?

834
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,850
How dare you?
I'm scared.

835
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:44,510
I'm not scared.
I feel like as a guy it's 90 percent 

836
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:48,921
women.
You should kind of just try and be 

837
00:37:48,921 --> 00:37:49,290
invisible in a yoga class.
Get the outside row,

838
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:52,050
keep your clothes on.
This is really their thing.

839
00:37:52,051 --> 00:37:54,180
And you're kind of visiting is their 
thing.

840
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,130
Yeah,
but the guy invented it.

841
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,880
I invented now he just,
he just took yoga and made it sweaty.

842
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:02,940
Well he just.
No,

843
00:38:02,941 --> 00:38:07,941
he just added.
He just put a bunch of poses in a 

844
00:38:07,941 --> 00:38:10,191
sequence and he tried to copyright that 
sequence but he was turned down so 

845
00:38:10,191 --> 00:38:11,610
there's people that he was suing.
He's a very sue,

846
00:38:11,611 --> 00:38:16,611
happy person.
So like if someone's say allegedly I 

847
00:38:16,611 --> 00:38:16,920
should say allegedly is a sue happy 
person.

848
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:17,780
Right.
So if somebody.

849
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:22,820
I don't want to get it.
If you were one of his disciples and 

850
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:28,560
started your own school,
you had his own program and then you 

851
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:28,560
said,
you know what,

852
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,760
this guy is kind of a Douche.
I don't want to pay him money anymore.

853
00:38:29,761 --> 00:38:33,360
I'm just going to go off and just call 
it Tom Papa's yoga.

854
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:35,830
You will get sued.
Really?

855
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:35,980
Yeah,

856
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,140
but even though he didn't invent any of 
those poses,

857
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:40,480
so he gets a piece of every bikram 
around the world.

858
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:43,330
That's where he's making all that.
That's why he's got all that Luke and he

859
00:38:43,331 --> 00:38:48,331
was trying to say that the,
the sequences in order,

860
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,220
the way that he's putting them together 
have some sort of a right,

861
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:55,360
an extra powerful property to them and 
that that was his patent,

862
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,990
but I believe we check on that because I
believe that was turned down.

863
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:00,750
Yeah,
I believe it was.

864
00:39:00,751 --> 00:39:02,680
He still made all that dough.
Yes.

865
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:08,110
He made a lot of fucking money.
You're probably still makes a lot of 

866
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:11,671
fucking money,
but at the six point five is not going 

867
00:39:11,671 --> 00:39:14,841
to make them flinch.
I'm sure he's got that and cars just 

868
00:39:14,841 --> 00:39:14,841
laying around.

869
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:15,760
I know.
I mean,

870
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,210
you know,
you go once in awhile.

871
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:20,290
It's 10 bucks a class.
How do you make them that much bank?

872
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:25,760
Well,
if you have thousands of schools all 

873
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,010
over the country and each over the 
world,

874
00:39:26,011 --> 00:39:28,290
really in each one of them pays you,
you know,

875
00:39:28,291 --> 00:39:29,790
whatever.
500 bucks a month.

876
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,460
Yeah,
yeah.

877
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:33,310
No,
that's,

878
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:36,960
that's where it comes from.
So here goes.

879
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:42,200
The court affirmed that although beak 
Rome had copyright protection in his 

880
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:46,260
published book on the sequence,
he could not thereby invoke copyright to

881
00:39:46,261 --> 00:39:49,560
stop others from using the sequences 
described in his book.

882
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:50,370
Uh,
yeah.

883
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:55,400
See that's like,
that's like someone teaching Jujitsu and

884
00:39:55,411 --> 00:39:57,860
saying you can't teach those moves,
right?

885
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:00,330
Julius,
who's been around for so long,

886
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:02,010
you could never,
you could never do that.

887
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,880
Yeah.
This guy was born in the sixties,

888
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:09,630
you know what I mean?
Exactly what we're here to take over 

889
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:09,630
yogas.
Thousands of years old,

890
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:14,040
the balls,
the balls on this guy literally all 

891
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,220
tucked away and that little grape 
smuggler and he wears.

892
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,590
There was a guy in my class that used to
go there for awhile.

893
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:22,170
He used to wear the grape smuggler.
He was very sot nom.

894
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:25,900
He was very.
You hit a man Bun,

895
00:40:25,901 --> 00:40:28,960
two smugglers and Amanda and I want to 
pick you up in the parking lot.

896
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:31,090
Totally.
Totally.

897
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:36,450
And I think the other women look at you 
over there and your Nike workout stuff 

898
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:36,450
and they're like,
alright,

899
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:37,030
he's peace vine.
They think so.

900
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:37,600
Yeah.
They like.

901
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:40,480
Thank you for not doing that.
I hope so.

902
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,010
I hope so.
I don't know.

903
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:45,100
The place I go to is very nice.
Very nice people.

904
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,480
Yeah.
But again,

905
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:52,050
it's not like the hot young hard,
but I'm probably the best looking girl 

906
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:52,050
in the class.

907
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,650
A road.
That was a joke.

908
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:55,360
I couldn't help it.
That's not true either.

909
00:40:56,140 --> 00:41:01,140
There's some cute ones,
but the point being is that's not what 

910
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:01,140
it is.
It's a,

911
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:01,790
you know,
but there is a sexual vibe there.

912
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:04,930
I mean you're just there to do yoga,
but there is that kind of thing,

913
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,230
which is why I'm not too big a fan of 
the classes.

914
00:41:08,231 --> 00:41:12,490
The team you up where they want you to 
partner up for this thing.

915
00:41:12,491 --> 00:41:13,330
Yeah.
You ever have that?

916
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,050
No.
Oh,

917
00:41:14,051 --> 00:41:16,560
like you stretch you out.
You got to get a partner,

918
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:18,490
get unhappy baby.
With your legs behind,

919
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:21,090
your partner pushed down on you and 
you're like,

920
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:25,050
you know,
farther on this lady happens.

921
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:28,480
That'd be actually the smartphone as a 
married man,

922
00:41:28,481 --> 00:41:33,481
that would be the smart man.
How much porn takes place in the Yoga 

923
00:41:33,481 --> 00:41:33,650
Student Yoga Studio where the yoga 
teacher says,

924
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:38,150
I would like to review some poses with 
you after class to give you some tips.

925
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:41,020
That'd be like if you were,
let's,

926
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,280
let's just be as politically correct 
about this possible.

927
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,000
If you were single and the person 
actually was into you and this all went 

928
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,530
down according to this,
this,

929
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,520
that would be the greatest like fantasy 
ever.

930
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,130
Like you're in that hot yoga class,
all hot and Sweaty,

931
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,810
and afterwards the teacher wants to 
fuck.

932
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:03,200
Damn.
She's like,

933
00:42:03,201 --> 00:42:08,201
Tom,
I just really feel like your practice 

934
00:42:08,201 --> 00:42:08,201
could aid with just a little private one
on one instruction.

935
00:42:08,201 --> 00:42:08,840
Yes.
He'd be like,

936
00:42:08,841 --> 00:42:09,950
sure,
sure.

937
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,690
First we're gonna start with a foot 
massage.

938
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:13,900
Okay.
You're back.

939
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,620
Your right.
Oh,

940
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:20,760
okay.
And she's rubbing your feet and lifting 

941
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,961
your legs.
I'm just going to stretch your legs out 

942
00:42:22,961 --> 00:42:24,350
and she's rubbing the inside of your 
thighs and you start moaning.

943
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:27,370
She moans back and the next thing you 
know it's on top.

944
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:30,110
Oh,
now my stay.

945
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:36,820
I had a massage at the Bacara resort and
Santa Barbara.

946
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:40,690
Oh Shit.
And The lady got up on the table,

947
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:45,430
like straddled me on the table like at 
one point and it just,

948
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:46,840
you know,
I'm always thinking,

949
00:42:46,841 --> 00:42:48,790
is it going to go someplace else?
It didn't.

950
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:52,990
But when I came back to the room and 
told my wife what had happened,

951
00:42:52,991 --> 00:42:55,120
she was horrified.
She angry.

952
00:42:55,121 --> 00:42:59,140
She was like that.
That does not happen ever.

953
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:01,960
She was obviously doing something.
I'm like,

954
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:03,760
she wasn't.

955
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:05,110
Well,
I mean,

956
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,970
time massage,
they do it all the time.

957
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:08,650
They jump up on top of it.
Oh yeah,

958
00:43:08,651 --> 00:43:10,630
they climb on you right.
This lady,

959
00:43:10,631 --> 00:43:12,690
I go to,
this bitch fucks me up when I say bitch,

960
00:43:12,691 --> 00:43:14,980
she's a very nice lady.
I shouldn't say bitch.

961
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:19,600
She's probably in her at least late 
fifties,

962
00:43:19,601 --> 00:43:22,630
maybe early sixties.
And she's from Thailand.

963
00:43:22,631 --> 00:43:25,720
Very nice lady.
She climbs on my back.

964
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:30,870
She pulls my arms up right.
She's stomping on me like she stomped 

965
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:32,110
the shit out of me.
She fucking,

966
00:43:32,111 --> 00:43:35,290
she gets her knee in my back,
brines in the elbows,

967
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,390
feet.
This wasn't that what?

968
00:43:37,391 --> 00:43:38,710
She's always.
She's always asking me,

969
00:43:38,711 --> 00:43:40,390
you'll care this.
Okay.

970
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:42,190
Come on.
Just go crazy.

971
00:43:42,191 --> 00:43:43,360
I'm fine.
Just do it.

972
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:44,860
Hurt me.
Go get nutty.

973
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,950
Do everything.
You feel like you need to deal with anti

974
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:48,940
vegf.
This a.

975
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:52,650
She just fucking climbs on top of that 
table and just jacks me.

976
00:43:55,970 --> 00:44:00,080
There's a lot of comedians in New York 
who get the massage lady to come over to

977
00:44:00,081 --> 00:44:00,920
their house.
To Jack.

978
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,390
Jack,
you're talking about Jim Norton.

979
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:05,240
You don't have to say a lot of 
comedians.

980
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:10,260
You could just say Jim Norton,
Jim Norton and the outer electrons that 

981
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:10,650
spawn from Jimmy and the other guys who 
go,

982
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:15,680
you could do that.
And the other one to get the number from

983
00:44:15,721 --> 00:44:18,750
the chat doesn't seem smart to me.
I talked to Jim about in these ones.

984
00:44:18,751 --> 00:44:20,010
Yeah.
But I had more of my house.

985
00:44:20,011 --> 00:44:20,550
They,
you know,

986
00:44:20,551 --> 00:44:21,390
they,
they,

987
00:44:21,391 --> 00:44:22,950
uh,
I have a security building.

988
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:23,870
They can't get inside.
I go,

989
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:28,880
but they know where you live now.
Like what if they develop some bizarre 

990
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,181
fixation on you from the radio show and 
then meet you after John Lennon style

991
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:37,190
outside your door?
I don't think there's any part of that 

992
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:38,340
scenario that he doesn't like show me 
say.

993
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:41,950
I think also,
you know,

994
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:47,340
you're,
you're dipping into the world of people 

995
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:49,170
who get paid for sex and there's not 
necessarily a bad world.

996
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:54,360
The,
I don't think there's anything wrong 

997
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:54,360
with it.
I don't think it's unnecessary world.

998
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:57,231
For some people.
There's nothing wrong with Jerkins 

999
00:44:57,231 --> 00:44:57,231
someone off.
It's like,

1000
00:44:57,231 --> 00:44:58,200
why is it okay to rub someone's back,
but it's not okay to rub their dick.

1001
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,210
You tell me.
It doesn't make any sense.

1002
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,230
It's foolishness,
right?

1003
00:45:02,231 --> 00:45:05,190
You know the only thing I mean,
I guess the possible threat of diseases,

1004
00:45:05,191 --> 00:45:07,950
but if as long as you know proper gun 
control,

1005
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:13,090
you know the aim that thing away from 
you always makes sure he pointed in a 

1006
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:16,680
safe distance and keep the safety on 
your fine and stand at least an inch and

1007
00:45:16,681 --> 00:45:18,870
a half away and don't put it near your 
eyes.

1008
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:22,830
Don't open your eyes up.
I don't know if it's Ms Dot.

1009
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:27,870
No,
I've never been to one of those places 

1010
00:45:28,501 --> 00:45:33,501
where you know it's going to happen.
I've never been in a place where it 

1011
00:45:33,501 --> 00:45:33,830
never happened.
I need to talk to Brian Redman.

1012
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:38,840
He'll hook you up,
but you kind of hope I never want to go 

1013
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:38,840
to the point of like,
Oh yeah,

1014
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,320
actually going there,
but you go to like the straight place at

1015
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:45,321
like a nice resort and stuff and it's 
always in the back of your mind like 

1016
00:45:45,321 --> 00:45:45,321
maybe.
But no.

1017
00:45:45,321 --> 00:45:46,560
Yeah,
I've never had a place do it,

1018
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:51,590
but I,
I have gone to a place where one of the 

1019
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:55,730
guys that works there,
I got busted because he was blowing all 

1020
00:45:55,730 --> 00:46:00,231
the dudes that would come in there.
Like they figured out that these gay 

1021
00:46:00,231 --> 00:46:02,520
guys like flamboyantly gay guys were 
coming to this one guy.

1022
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:06,210
They would be like super excited to see 
him like a little too excited.

1023
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:09,750
Right.
And he had this little thing going on.

1024
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:13,440
He would have these guys show up and he 
would give them like,

1025
00:46:13,441 --> 00:46:14,700
you know,
half decent massage,

1026
00:46:14,701 --> 00:46:19,701
suck their dick.
And then get out of their fucking 

1027
00:46:19,701 --> 00:46:19,701
Gideon,
get a big tip,

1028
00:46:19,701 --> 00:46:22,500
but problem with those flamboyant gay 
guys is they're very vocal.

1029
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:27,530
They like to talk about right now.
That was the best massage I've ever 

1030
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:28,500
seen.
I'm sure they had a nickname for him and

1031
00:46:28,501 --> 00:46:30,470
for the place.
Well,

1032
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:33,180
you know,
I guess just the word got out,

1033
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,330
but you know,
to think that I was getting a legitimate

1034
00:46:36,331 --> 00:46:40,300
massage just a few doors over.
Wasn't there a movie sister?

1035
00:46:41,350 --> 00:46:46,350
Wasn't there a movie star that got in 
trouble for trying to.

1036
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:48,060
John Travolta.
Sexual advancement,

1037
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:49,230
right.
John Travolta.

1038
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,610
Digital budgets.
Volta.

1039
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:52,530
Yeah.
He would.

1040
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:55,550
He would get massages and like their 
hands.

1041
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:57,940
Yes.
Up into their.

1042
00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:00,350
What's going on over there?
Oh,

1043
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:05,480
that's a good time in that area.
Opening it up.

1044
00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:09,910
Where's my keys?
Look for my phone.

1045
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:13,710
Did you see him in Oj?
I've met him.

1046
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:15,930
You know in the Oj show?
No.

1047
00:47:15,931 --> 00:47:19,680
All the new show on Fx just started last
week.

1048
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:20,460
Oh,
come on.

1049
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:23,340
It's so good.
Is it in the worst way?

1050
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,350
No,
it's good.

1051
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:26,640
It's good.
A good show.

1052
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:28,710
It's going to be.
It's a 10 part series.

1053
00:47:28,711 --> 00:47:32,500
I think it's actually good Oj versus the
people versus Oj.

1054
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:33,550
Legit.
Good.

1055
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:34,900
Oh,
I thought you were saying it's good.

1056
00:47:34,901 --> 00:47:37,810
Like it's retarded and like should watch
it because it's bad.

1057
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:42,310
And Travolta plays Kardashians.
Now.

1058
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:44,290
Robert Shapiro.
Robert Shapiro.

1059
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:46,210
Did they shave his head?
Creepy.

1060
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:48,570
Cool.
That's Shapiro.

1061
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:51,550
Wasn't Shapiro Bald guys?
Kind of flamboyant.

1062
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:56,700
Oh,
I'm thinking I'm confusing Robert 

1063
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,560
Shapiro with f Lee Baily,
but I don't think any job this,

1064
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:01,720
this thing is you think like you're 
tapped out on Oj.

1065
00:48:01,721 --> 00:48:04,450
Like why would I watch one episode and 
you're like,

1066
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:06,220
Oh man,
this is going to be John Travolta.

1067
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:06,910
Jose.
Good.

1068
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Wonderful Wig.
He does that is just get in close on 

1069
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:12,130
that hairline.
Jamie.

1070
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:15,430
That is impeccable.
That is really nice.

1071
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:20,550
This poor bastard.
I was at a store the other day and this 

1072
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:22,771
poor bastard in front of me had one of 
the worst things I've ever seen in my 

1073
00:48:22,771 --> 00:48:23,560
life.
I really say don't full on wig.

1074
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:26,500
It was ridiculous.
It was just ridiculous.

1075
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:29,290
20 16 wig.
Oh my God.

1076
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:32,620
Have you seen Mickey Rourke now?
Oh God,

1077
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:35,710
that's perfect.
We're going to have fucking heroin.

1078
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:37,240
It's incredible.
It's on again tonight.

1079
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:44,340
You'll like it [inaudible] he plays.
You could definitely see him trying to 

1080
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:45,460
put his rump and massage therapist 
hands.

1081
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:46,540
Could see it.
Yeah.

1082
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:49,070
He seems fairly gay while he's doing it.
Yeah.

1083
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,250
Really?
Yo.

1084
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,150
He's.
Yeah.

1085
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:54,750
He's playing this very erudite.
Hmm.

1086
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:55,630
Yeah.
Hmm.

1087
00:48:56,050 --> 00:48:57,040
Good,
good.

1088
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,300
Really,
really good.

1089
00:48:58,420 --> 00:48:59,410
Okay.
Dude,

1090
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:04,430
I'm on episode eight of 'em Narchos.
There's only tell.

1091
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:07,180
Yeah,
I finished episode eight last night.

1092
00:49:07,181 --> 00:49:09,950
I'm depressed that there's two left.
Really bad.

1093
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:11,390
So good.
Wow.

1094
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:12,400
It's so good.

1095
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:17,210
Pablo Escobar was a mother fucker.
Really?

1096
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:22,360
He built his own fucking jail.
He turned himself into his own jail.

1097
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,460
He built his own.
He made a deal with the government,

1098
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:28,310
with the Colombian government where he 
would admit to.

1099
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:33,340
This is all historical.
Who says this is the historical fact box

1100
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:36,320
taken from wikipedia.
I actually knew about this in advance,

1101
00:49:36,321 --> 00:49:38,390
but I just didn't know how they were 
going to play it out on the show,

1102
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:42,770
but he did a fantastic job in the show,
but he turned himself.

1103
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:47,771
I mean,
he was a fucking major league drug 

1104
00:49:47,771 --> 00:49:47,771
dealer.
The greatest drug dealer of all time.

1105
00:49:47,771 --> 00:49:52,151
Next to El Chapo.
El Chapo was apparently even a bigger 

1106
00:49:52,151 --> 00:49:55,340
deal than him really,
but he made it so that he would only get

1107
00:49:55,341 --> 00:49:58,430
charged with one count of smuggling 
drugs.

1108
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:02,540
And even then he wanted a bargain that 
down to a lesser charge.

1109
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:06,320
He built his own super powerful luxury 
prison,

1110
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:10,580
had his own guards to guard him and this
super powerful

1111
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:15,610
luxury prison cheese.
And that's where it was in Columbia,

1112
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:17,540
in Columbia.
So the government,

1113
00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:19,910
they had um,
oh well he killed everybody and,

1114
00:50:19,911 --> 00:50:21,680
but they had him now and he's like,

1115
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:24,080
I even have them nailed.
He turned himself in.

1116
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:26,900
He was just killing everybody.
She really killed,

1117
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,370
blew up planes,

1118
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:31,790
just killed everybody.
She's just killed thousands of people.

1119
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:37,880
I mean he had all these sicario is 
apparently that was what they call a 

1120
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:42,281
hitman Spanish.
He just had all these hitman's killing 

1121
00:50:42,281 --> 00:50:42,281
cops,
killing everybody,

1122
00:50:42,281 --> 00:50:42,800
killing judges.
He,

1123
00:50:42,801 --> 00:50:47,801
they,
they even had all this evidence about 

1124
00:50:47,801 --> 00:50:50,351
him dealing drugs.
So he hired this like a communist sort 

1125
00:50:51,441 --> 00:50:56,441
of revolutionary group to overtake the 
government building where his data was 

1126
00:50:57,051 --> 00:51:00,470
being held and blew it up,
lit it on fire,

1127
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:06,730
lit up all this fucking evidence.
We took over a fucking government 

1128
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:06,730
building.
Like,

1129
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:07,670
oh well we can house.
It was insane.

1130
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:09,680
It's insane story.
He's still alive.

1131
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,300
He's dead as fuck.
He's dead.

1132
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:14,060
You have to get them.
I'm going to have to watch your show.

1133
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,990
I'm watching Oj.
It was a shootout,

1134
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:21,050
if I remember correctly from rival gang 
or the government.

1135
00:51:21,051 --> 00:51:22,110
I think the government shot him.

1136
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:23,100
Wow.
Who?

1137
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:26,640
Who shot him?
Jeremy Pablo was uh,

1138
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:28,490
was caring,
caring so much.

1139
00:51:28,491 --> 00:51:32,060
I was earning so much each year they 
read off 10 percent of the money because

1140
00:51:32,061 --> 00:51:35,180
the rats would eat it in storage or be 
damaged by water.

1141
00:51:35,181 --> 00:51:39,080
And Lost Mike.
That would be about two point 1 billion.

1142
00:51:39,081 --> 00:51:42,500
So two point 1 billion per month,
per month was what?

1143
00:51:42,501 --> 00:51:44,720
The rats?
No,

1144
00:51:44,721 --> 00:51:49,721
it says here,
it says each year picture right above 

1145
00:51:49,721 --> 00:51:50,850
it.
Said it was factored in.

1146
00:51:50,851 --> 00:51:53,960
A two point 1 billion loss in profits 
each month.

1147
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:54,980
Well,
scroll that down.

1148
00:51:54,981 --> 00:51:57,040
Last.
The loss was to what it says it was.

1149
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,960
It was earning so much.
Each year he'd write off 10 percent.

1150
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:03,800
That would be to write 10 percent per 
year.

1151
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:07,490
She's $420 million a week.

1152
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:11,900
Look at his face to look at.
I'm happy.

1153
00:52:11,901 --> 00:52:13,310
Fuck.
Happy Dude.

1154
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:15,920
Yes.
Happy to do so much money.

1155
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:21,640
So much money.
I always wonder what these guys eat for 

1156
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:22,850
dinner.
Whatever the fuck they want babies.

1157
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:27,620
What's he saying?
Chinese babies around 6:00

1158
00:52:27,621 --> 00:52:29,450
at night.
Who was he talking to?

1159
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:32,660
That was the big shows up.
That picture did him in because that was

1160
00:52:32,661 --> 00:52:34,670
one of the earliest pictures of him 
getting arrested.

1161
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:37,940
He got arrested and they will any.
He was smiling at them like,

1162
00:52:37,941 --> 00:52:42,941
you dumb fucks.
You didn't get an arrest me and then 

1163
00:52:42,941 --> 00:52:44,720
just wrecked havoc on the people that 
arrested him.

1164
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:46,340
He just.
It was amazing,

1165
00:52:46,341 --> 00:52:47,470
man.
Amazing.

1166
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:50,930
So the show's great.
He wants started a fire with $2,000,000

1167
00:52:50,931 --> 00:52:55,931
because his daughter was cold for real 
man.

1168
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:58,280
Wow.
It was.

1169
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:00,970
What years was this?
It looks like eighties.

1170
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:03,250
Nineties.
This is the fucking cocaine years,

1171
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,470
right?
What his is this subtle scarface.

1172
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:10,370
Wow.
His son who's 30,

1173
00:53:10,371 --> 00:53:12,560
he's 38 years old since changed his 
name.

1174
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:16,010
Describe what life was like on the run 
with Sebastian Maniscalco,

1175
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:21,410
if that makes sense.
Jesus always ducking fucking.

1176
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:26,220
It's unbelievable story and it's so

1177
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:30,210
well done that show narcos.
Netflix is killing it.

1178
00:53:30,211 --> 00:53:32,670
They're so good right now.
So good.

1179
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:36,750
There's a house of cards that mean 
making a murderer.

1180
00:53:36,770 --> 00:53:37,680
Oh,
I haven't seen that yet.

1181
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:43,280
That one's pretty good.
I haven't seen you will give it getting 

1182
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:47,591
mad at me because I haven't seen it.
You know that one around eight a guy and

1183
00:53:48,151 --> 00:53:48,810
you're like,
all right,

1184
00:53:48,811 --> 00:53:51,860
let's wrap this up.
I'll really like.

1185
00:53:52,410 --> 00:53:57,390
You're kind of like push them through 
like one more set Sunday night.

1186
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,910
I want him to agree to a late show on 
Sunday.

1187
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:04,990
Right?
Exactly the funny fuck face in the 

1188
00:54:04,990 --> 00:54:07,500
middle of nowhere.
Did you see soaked in bleach?

1189
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:08,970
No.

1190
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:14,170
That is the documentary that was created
with the help of the private 

1191
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:16,190
investigator.
The Courtney love hired,

1192
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:19,130
who actually believes that she had Kurt 
cobain killed.

1193
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:24,910
She hired the private investigator,
hired the private investigator to find 

1194
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:25,760
him during the time that he was missing 
and blah,

1195
00:54:25,761 --> 00:54:26,030
blah,
blah,

1196
00:54:26,031 --> 00:54:26,420
blah,
blah.

1197
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:31,870
During his interactions with her,
he believed her to be so deceptive and 

1198
00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:35,030
such a liar and a manipulator,
and then the evidence that he presents,

1199
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:37,580
he believes is enough to reopen the 
case.

1200
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:40,490
He said they did a terrible job of 
examining the body.

1201
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:40,950
They,
they,

1202
00:54:41,170 --> 00:54:46,170
they cremated them within six days.
The police called it a suicide,

1203
00:54:46,581 --> 00:54:49,700
not an autopsy specialists,
which is just not the way you do it.

1204
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:52,880
And he said there's enough evidence to 
point to that.

1205
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:58,390
He and his words thinks that courtney 
love had Kurt cobain killed for the 

1206
00:54:58,390 --> 00:54:58,390
money because he was leaving her.
I

1207
00:54:58,850 --> 00:55:00,140
had him killed.
Yeah,

1208
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:03,380
or helped him,
helped him kill himself.

1209
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:08,330
They said that the amount of cocaine or 
heroin or that was in his body was three

1210
00:55:08,331 --> 00:55:12,710
times the lethal dose.
But of course that means for me,

1211
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:16,100
that was never done heroin,
but like was it for him?

1212
00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:21,270
The guy who did heroin all the time,
that other documentary with all the 

1213
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:22,580
doodles moving around.
She see that one.

1214
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,890
What's that one with all the doodles?
Yeah.

1215
00:55:24,891 --> 00:55:28,670
They took all of his notebooks.
Montage of heck yeah,

1216
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:33,760
I haven't seen that one.
There's a couple of scenes where they 

1217
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:33,760
show them,
you know,

1218
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,850
blitzed out on heroin and oh really?
It's too bad.

1219
00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:38,540
Drugs are bad.
So bad.

1220
00:55:38,690 --> 00:55:43,690
I mean just wasted with this kid.
Like his little kid is right there and 

1221
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:43,690
like her birthday,
something like that.

1222
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:46,040
Oh,
that's so sad.

1223
00:55:46,041 --> 00:55:47,930
He's just in another planet.

1224
00:55:49,370 --> 00:55:50,600
Bad,
bad drug.

1225
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,150
I used to know a guy or a serious heroin
problem,

1226
00:55:53,151 --> 00:55:55,100
but he was like a world class pool 
player.

1227
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:58,770
Oh yeah.
And he would get heroin down and then we

1228
00:55:58,771 --> 00:56:01,040
play pool and he,
he wouldn't miss.

1229
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:04,700
He had no nerves and he would be playing
my friend George the Greek,

1230
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:06,010
not like the famous George,
the Greek,

1231
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:11,020
the racist guy.
Although this guy was probably racing 

1232
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:11,020
right?
Jimmy,

1233
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:11,600
the Greek.
Jimmy the Greek,

1234
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:13,500
right.
My friend George degree,

1235
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:18,520
he would talk like,
this is fucking cock sucker and a ga 

1236
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:22,211
Greek would be so mad because he would 
gamble with this guy and the guy's name 

1237
00:56:22,211 --> 00:56:25,031
was water dog.
They would call me the buffalo bill or 

1238
00:56:25,031 --> 00:56:25,031
water dog.
There's two nicknames.

1239
00:56:25,031 --> 00:56:26,860
Both cool names.
This guy used to go to the bathroom.

1240
00:56:26,861 --> 00:56:30,070
He would lock the door in the men's room
and executive billiards in white plains,

1241
00:56:30,071 --> 00:56:35,071
New York.
He would go in there and lock the 

1242
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:35,071
bathroom door and then come out 10 
years,

1243
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:36,040
10 years,
10 years later to him,

1244
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:41,160
but 10 minutes later we'd come out just 
whacked out of his mind.

1245
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:46,360
He was sitting in a bar stool like this.
He would sit down and he would have his 

1246
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:50,581
arms like on the rest is risk.
Would just hang there like his hands 

1247
00:56:50,581 --> 00:56:55,380
gently rest on his gut,
his hands and just sit there and he 

1248
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:58,681
would just zone out for like another 20 
minutes and then he would get up and be 

1249
00:56:59,411 --> 00:57:04,411
good.
He would get up and he had like shark 

1250
00:57:04,411 --> 00:57:04,411
eyes.
His eyes were like black,

1251
00:57:04,411 --> 00:57:08,851
like his pupils were totally dilated and
he would get up and he would screw 

1252
00:57:08,851 --> 00:57:08,851
together as cute.

1253
00:57:08,851 --> 00:57:09,700
There's a photo of him,
you could find it online.

1254
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:13,900
Buffalo bill or water dog,
a pool player.

1255
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:17,890
Um,
I forget his real name,

1256
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:23,020
but anyway,
he screwed together as kill and he 

1257
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:25,890
wouldn't fucking miss and they were 
playing on this table with these really 

1258
00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:29,701
tiny tight pockets.
It was a gambler's tables table one at 

1259
00:57:29,701 --> 00:57:32,110
executive billiards and they were 
playing for thousands of dollars and you

1260
00:57:32,111 --> 00:57:34,090
know,
that's a fucking lot of pressure.

1261
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:37,930
I didn't feel a thing.
He was just dead on the inside.

1262
00:57:37,931 --> 00:57:41,660
Just gone from how long will last?
It was good for hours,

1263
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:42,330
hours like that?
Yeah.

1264
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:43,400
How many years?
Oh,

1265
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:44,650
he's dead.
He's dead now.

1266
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,470
He died a few years back.
What were you doing?

1267
00:57:47,471 --> 00:57:49,630
Shooting Pool in white plains.
Twice to live.

1268
00:57:49,631 --> 00:57:51,160
I used to live in white plains,
new Rochelle.

1269
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:52,270
Oh really?
Yeah.

1270
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:57,360
I bought,
I got an apartment in new Rochelle 

1271
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:57,360
because it was close to executive 
billiards in white plains.

1272
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:57,360
Really?
Yeah,

1273
00:57:58,490 --> 00:57:59,900
it's great.
I was there,

1274
00:57:59,901 --> 00:58:02,710
but so often my manager thought that I 
had a problem.

1275
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:08,280
He's like,
do you taken pool more seriously than 

1276
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:08,280
your career?
My God,

1277
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:12,460
I might be just so much fun.
The people that are hung out with were 

1278
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:13,630
so fun.
Really?

1279
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:16,810
Mount Vernon,
Tommy international style.

1280
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:20,200
I'll hang out with a guy who was an 
international credit card smuggler.

1281
00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:25,290
He was the first really,
his name is international style and 

1282
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:27,100
international south was a.
He was a Gambler,

1283
00:58:27,101 --> 00:58:30,700
but I use that word loosely because he 
was an incredible loser,

1284
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:36,120
but he made so much money from all this 
credit card swindled that he would go 

1285
00:58:37,661 --> 00:58:40,030
into the pool hall.
This is before my time before I met him.

1286
00:58:40,031 --> 00:58:41,440
I met him once.
He got out of jail,

1287
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:43,330
but he was still a loser.
He just couldn't win.

1288
00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:48,390
Right.
Psychologically he had like these 

1289
00:58:48,390 --> 00:58:50,551
blocks,
like he would have a ball like sitting 

1290
00:58:50,551 --> 00:58:53,191
in front of the whole for a thousand 
dollars and he just bumped because 

1291
00:58:53,191 --> 00:58:53,191
bobble it.

1292
00:58:53,191 --> 00:58:53,840
He could never win.
He'd never won.

1293
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:56,440
He never.
He was just psychology.

1294
00:58:56,530 --> 00:58:58,330
It's a weird thing.
It was crazy.

1295
00:58:58,331 --> 00:59:00,730
So during the time where he was a 
swindler,

1296
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:03,880
what he would do is,
this was the early days of credit cards.

1297
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:06,790
This is the 19 eighties American 
Express.

1298
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:10,180
They would take these receipts that they
would get them from stores,

1299
00:59:10,181 --> 00:59:12,070
like say if they run your credit card on
something.

1300
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:13,000
Yeah.
They get that.

1301
00:59:13,370 --> 00:59:18,370
The carbons,
they would get those carbons and then 

1302
00:59:18,370 --> 00:59:18,430
they would make copies of the credit 
card,

1303
00:59:18,431 --> 00:59:22,610
they make another copy of the credit 
card and just fucking run up these crazy

1304
00:59:22,611 --> 00:59:25,130
bills by all this shit and then sell the
shit.

1305
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:30,420
And so he would get money and they would
come to the pool hall was just Brown 

1306
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:34,241
paper bags filled with hundred dollar 
bills and people from all over the world

1307
00:59:34,341 --> 00:59:36,320
would come to find him to play with 
them.

1308
00:59:36,470 --> 00:59:37,330
Really?
Yeah.

1309
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:40,640
Because he was a loser because he was a 
loser with tons and tons of cash.

1310
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:44,270
So he would just lose all of it.
And I say he's a loser.

1311
00:59:44,271 --> 00:59:46,430
I don't mean like as a person who was a 
very nice guy,

1312
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:50,180
but I mean like as a pool player,
he was a loser.

1313
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:54,140
She wasn't a bad player either,
but like good enough to play.

1314
00:59:54,141 --> 00:59:58,490
But the big games player,
he psychologically was a beat,

1315
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,530
a beat man.
He just could not do it.

1316
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,360
Did he drink?
Um,

1317
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:03,260
nope.
No,

1318
01:00:03,261 --> 01:00:04,570
I don't believe he did.
Uh,

1319
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,950
he died of cancer and it was an ugly one
to.

1320
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:09,210
My friend's mom was a,
the,

1321
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:12,230
one of the nurses that was taking care 
of them and it was just,

1322
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:16,100
it ended bad,
but they're all dead.

1323
01:00:16,101 --> 01:00:17,930
All those people that I really like.
Then yeah,

1324
01:00:17,931 --> 01:00:22,931
the guy who owned it,
guy as red and he was just fucking 

1325
01:00:22,931 --> 01:00:24,080
hilarious piano players,
musician.

1326
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:29,290
I wanted to invest his money and he 
bought a pool hall and it just became 

1327
01:00:29,290 --> 01:00:32,180
this incredible hangout because she's 
this guy guy as a reedy who owned it was

1328
01:00:32,181 --> 01:00:35,270
the nicest guy on the planet and 
everybody loved them.

1329
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:38,000
So they would come and hang out at his 
pool hall,

1330
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:40,190
like partially just to say hi and hang 
out with him.

1331
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:42,350
And then he created this incredible 
environment.

1332
01:00:42,351 --> 01:00:46,700
It was like all fun and laughs.
And did you know other comics sit there?

1333
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:48,050
Just one.
There was one.

1334
01:00:48,051 --> 01:00:50,480
This Guy Jon Tobin who was a buddy of 
mine at the time,

1335
01:00:50,481 --> 01:00:53,750
he was a,
he worked there part time Gig.

1336
01:00:53,751 --> 01:00:57,230
They're like the counterman for a little
bit,

1337
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:59,480
but no,
it was mostly just pool players.

1338
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:02,090
Me and a bunch of pool players,
it's pretty cool.

1339
01:01:02,110 --> 01:01:07,110
Degenerates and Weirdos and it's pretty 
cool that you had the balls to just go 

1340
01:01:07,110 --> 01:01:07,800
hang out there with all these crack.

1341
01:01:07,850 --> 01:01:09,860
Well,
I became addicted to pool.

1342
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:12,860
When I became addicted to pool,
it was like that was my spot.

1343
01:01:12,861 --> 01:01:17,861
I was there every night and I knew a lot
of the people that worked there and ran 

1344
01:01:17,861 --> 01:01:22,151
it and guy the owner was a good friend 
of mine so we would be there oftentimes 

1345
01:01:22,151 --> 01:01:24,560
till the morning and then we'd get up.
We'd go to the diner and this was.

1346
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:29,590
I was 24 or 20 somewhere around there,
so I had no job.

1347
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:33,860
My job was to do jokes,
so do jokes.

1348
01:01:33,861 --> 01:01:35,960
At night I would.
I would literally,

1349
01:01:35,961 --> 01:01:38,990
I would get up and go to the gym.
I'd had over the pool hall.

1350
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:41,030
I'd hang out,
see what's going on.

1351
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:46,750
Then I would go do my gig and then I'd 
come back to the pool hall and I'd stay 

1352
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:46,750
there until the morning.
Where would you go gig?

1353
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:51,560
Wherever it was either in the city or a 
lot of the gigs that I did.

1354
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:54,530
When I first moved to New York,
I used to do that,

1355
01:01:54,531 --> 01:01:56,840
a danger fields.
I did the comic strip.

1356
01:01:56,841 --> 01:01:58,070
I did all those.
I did catch.

1357
01:01:58,100 --> 01:01:59,750
That's when cash was still there at 
catch,

1358
01:01:59,751 --> 01:02:01,610
a rising star was still there.
But um,

1359
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:05,600
I didn't like the fact that I only did 
10 minutes and then it wasn't any money,

1360
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:07,270
so I was doing a lot of Connecticut 
gigs.

1361
01:02:07,271 --> 01:02:10,850
So this Guy John Schuler,
do you ever do those Connecticut cakes?

1362
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:11,990
And.
I don't think so.

1363
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:13,520
John Schuller,
he kept me paid.

1364
01:02:13,550 --> 01:02:14,960
That name's familiar.
It was great.

1365
01:02:14,961 --> 01:02:15,920
Great Guy.
Yeah.

1366
01:02:15,921 --> 01:02:19,010
He had a bunch of good gigs.
They were solid Connecticut,

1367
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:20,060
you know,

1368
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:24,960
a hotel lounge bar and had a nice little
stage.

1369
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:27,720
But there was Jersey gigs.
I did a lot of those for this guy.

1370
01:02:27,721 --> 01:02:29,720
Bob Gonzo Gonzo.
Yeah.

1371
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:30,500
Know Him.
Yeah,

1372
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:33,030
I think it did a couple like out in 
summit,

1373
01:02:33,031 --> 01:02:34,800
New Jersey or something like that.
Yeah,

1374
01:02:34,801 --> 01:02:37,170
the shore.
I did those with him and um,

1375
01:02:37,890 --> 01:02:39,690
I did um,
with auto and George,

1376
01:02:39,691 --> 01:02:44,691
we did a bunch of those there.
And then I did a decided Connecticut 

1377
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:48,210
Jersey Long Island did a lot of long 
island gigs,

1378
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:53,240
the brokerage governors.
But so is the thing that made you set up

1379
01:02:53,941 --> 01:02:55,470
shop there?
Yeah,

1380
01:02:55,530 --> 01:02:58,170
that was going to the city couldn't 
afford the city,

1381
01:02:58,560 --> 01:02:59,950
couldn't afford parking.
Right.

1382
01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:01,470
I knew that.
I enjoyed your car.

1383
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:06,500
I needed a car.
I had a car and I wasn't gonna get rid 

1384
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:06,500
of it.
So it was like,

1385
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:07,020
okay,
I can't afford an apartment.

1386
01:03:07,021 --> 01:03:11,580
Like apartments for people were out of 
the country or out of the city.

1387
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:17,300
New York City apartment rates are so 
insane that it doesn't make sense that 

1388
01:03:17,341 --> 01:03:19,620
anybody could afford to live there other
than rich people.

1389
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:23,840
And it's gotten so much worse from back 
then way worse way than it was.

1390
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:26,040
You couldn't achieve it.
Now forget it.

1391
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:31,250
Well,
I was poor as fuck you mean back then 

1392
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:33,321
when I first moved there,
I lived with my grandfather and north 

1393
01:03:33,321 --> 01:03:33,321
ninth street in Newark,
New Jersey,

1394
01:03:33,321 --> 01:03:38,000
which was the ghetto.
My grandfather art got it in the 19 

1395
01:03:38,101 --> 01:03:43,101
forties and when it was an all Italian 
neighborhood and then it became an all 

1396
01:03:43,101 --> 01:03:44,790
black neighborhood.
And then it became Puerto Rican,

1397
01:03:44,791 --> 01:03:49,791
then it became Dominican and production 
left and just dried up.

1398
01:03:51,270 --> 01:03:56,270
Also,
they did blockbusting where the real 

1399
01:03:56,270 --> 01:03:56,270
estate people would,
uh,

1400
01:03:56,270 --> 01:03:57,030
come door to door and they would say,
hey,

1401
01:03:57,060 --> 01:03:58,720
black people are moving in,
you know,

1402
01:03:58,721 --> 01:04:00,430
you've got to sell now.
Otherwise you're,

1403
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:02,700
your property value's going to go 
through the floor.

1404
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:05,880
And they would literally clean out whole
blocks like that.

1405
01:04:05,881 --> 01:04:08,160
And Salomon people would sell their 
houses in a panic.

1406
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:09,510
No.
Yeah.

1407
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:10,740
Really?
Yeah,

1408
01:04:10,741 --> 01:04:12,000
they did to my grandfather.
And like,

1409
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:14,070
I liked black people.
Get the fuck Outta here.

1410
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:17,170
He wouldn't move.
He stayed there to the end.

1411
01:04:17,470 --> 01:04:17,820
Yeah,
it was,

1412
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:19,440
it was crazy.
Yeah.

1413
01:04:19,450 --> 01:04:22,080
There was a common tactic that they used
to use.

1414
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:27,350
Find a picture of that guy.
So dirty kind of started getting 

1415
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:30,540
distracted about Mike Segal.
No,

1416
01:04:30,541 --> 01:04:30,900
no,
no,

1417
01:04:30,901 --> 01:04:32,640
no.
Mike Segal is a famous world champion.

1418
01:04:32,641 --> 01:04:36,600
This guy's name was buffalo bill.
That is what they used to call them,

1419
01:04:36,601 --> 01:04:40,140
pool player Gambler or water dot.
But he was.

1420
01:04:40,270 --> 01:04:42,750
So did you find weird looking guy?
Did you know of the pool hall?

1421
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:44,700
And then say,
let me try and find a place near here or

1422
01:04:44,710 --> 01:04:46,170
to the other way around.
No,

1423
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:49,290
I was living in New Jersey when my 
grandfather was trying to save up enough

1424
01:04:49,291 --> 01:04:54,291
money to get an apartment and when I 
saved up enough money to get an 

1425
01:04:54,291 --> 01:04:54,291
apartment,
um,

1426
01:04:54,291 --> 01:04:58,460
I was taking the trek down to white 
plains all the time as my friend John 

1427
01:04:58,780 --> 01:05:03,780
and my friend Johnny B,
who was Johnny B was actually a 

1428
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:07,100
professional pool hustler who's like,
one of my best friends became one of my 

1429
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:08,440
best friends at around that same town 
about.

1430
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:11,790
But it was a special place man.
I've thought about almost writing a book

1431
01:05:11,850 --> 01:05:15,930
about the adventures of being a part of 
that place because it was so fun.

1432
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:18,100
I was just going to say,
I think I've been in la too long because

1433
01:05:18,101 --> 01:05:19,150
I,
the whole time you're like,

1434
01:05:19,151 --> 01:05:23,830
this is a great movie or show was.
It was like a movie.

1435
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:29,060
It was like every night there was 
something going on there and we would 

1436
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:29,060
run to get to that place.
Wow.

1437
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:33,330
I couldn't wait to get in there.
You get in the door and no one had a 

1438
01:05:33,330 --> 01:05:34,060
phone back then because there was a,
there was a cell phone or a payphone,

1439
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:39,160
payphone.
People would be on the phone all the 

1440
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:39,160
time,
like getting calls.

1441
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:40,240
It would ring and people would call and 
so no one had,

1442
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:45,270
no one had cell phones but people would 
come in from all over the country 

1443
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:45,700
because that was a place that will have 
gambling action.

1444
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:48,200
So guys would come in from Canada,
guys would come in,

1445
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:50,610
California,
a guy came in from there,

1446
01:05:50,690 --> 01:05:53,580
they can come in from all over the place
playing but not at that level.

1447
01:05:53,610 --> 01:05:54,580
Oh No,
I wasn't good.

1448
01:05:54,581 --> 01:05:55,830
You're just playing,
you know,

1449
01:05:56,050 --> 01:06:01,050
I was more of a spectator.
I was playing and I was playing in 

1450
01:06:01,050 --> 01:06:01,050
tournaments and stuff like that and I 
got.

1451
01:06:01,050 --> 01:06:02,920
I got better over the couple of years 
that I lived there,

1452
01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:05,770
but I was never at a level that these 
guys were at.

1453
01:06:05,771 --> 01:06:08,590
These are like real professional level 
players would go there.

1454
01:06:08,650 --> 01:06:13,650
And is it like any sport,
like those guys just had something 

1455
01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:14,350
special or they just put more time in 
time?

1456
01:06:14,430 --> 01:06:15,190
Yeah,
I think.

1457
01:06:15,850 --> 01:06:20,850
I think there are special,
there's certain special things like 

1458
01:06:20,850 --> 01:06:23,401
athleticism,
like Karl Malone or like a Michael 

1459
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:29,020
Jordan or know fill in the blanks with 
some of the elite athletes.

1460
01:06:29,530 --> 01:06:31,180
Lebron,
Lebron James,

1461
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:33,910
and you use your regular guy at yoga.

1462
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:35,800
Yeah.
You're a regular guy.

1463
01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:41,130
He's not.
There's a giant advantage is a giant 

1464
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:44,611
advantage.
He has that thing and then on top of 

1465
01:06:44,611 --> 01:06:47,131
that,
I think when you get a guy like Lebron 

1466
01:06:47,131 --> 01:06:49,500
James,
but you get as a guy who has this 

1467
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:51,630
massive physical advantage and then 
dedication and then intelligence and 

1468
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:53,500
then discipline and then you get a great
one.

1469
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:57,540
It's once in a lifetime athlete that 
comes along that has the whole package,

1470
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:02,760
but we'll pull.
It's not like that because there's no 

1471
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:02,950
physical strength aspect of it.
Long arms.

1472
01:07:03,010 --> 01:07:04,450
Nope.
Doesn't help at all.

1473
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,610
Some of the best players in the world.
Really tiny guys.

1474
01:07:06,710 --> 01:07:09,230
Are they really using the bridge?
Well,

1475
01:07:09,231 --> 01:07:14,231
there are other switch hands switch.
They play lefthanded like Jose Perico 

1476
01:07:14,231 --> 01:07:14,560
was like one of the greatest players of 
all time.

1477
01:07:14,561 --> 01:07:16,320
He's like five one.
Oh really?

1478
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:18,020
Tiny little Filipino guy.
Yeah,

1479
01:07:19,150 --> 01:07:22,360
so it's just more just dedication and 
time and dedication,

1480
01:07:22,370 --> 01:07:23,980
the implant,
understanding of geometry,

1481
01:07:24,550 --> 01:07:29,550
angles,
understanding like how the ball's gonna 

1482
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:30,010
reflect off other balls and it's going 
to bounce off the rail.

1483
01:07:30,010 --> 01:07:32,470
Things along those lines.
So you got good though.

1484
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:33,730
I got pretty good.
Yeah.

1485
01:07:33,850 --> 01:07:35,480
I never got real good.
I got it.

1486
01:07:35,530 --> 01:07:38,200
I got good compared to regular people.
Regular people see me play the like,

1487
01:07:38,201 --> 01:07:43,201
Holy Shit.
He's like a pool player would never be 

1488
01:07:43,201 --> 01:07:44,850
impressed.
Now I'm okay that game with like,

1489
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:47,620
I don't think there are pockets.
Three cushioned billiards.

1490
01:07:48,630 --> 01:07:49,900
Three different balls.
And they were,

1491
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:55,220
yeah,
you hit one ball and it has to go three 

1492
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:56,230
cushions and then hit the other bowl.
It's a weird game.

1493
01:07:56,490 --> 01:08:01,490
Yeah.
That's a game that's really popular in 

1494
01:08:01,490 --> 01:08:01,490
South America.
Really popular in Korea.

1495
01:08:01,490 --> 01:08:02,280
Korea town.
You can go to Korea town.

1496
01:08:02,290 --> 01:08:03,880
They have three cushioned billiards 
places.

1497
01:08:03,910 --> 01:08:04,780
Oh really?
Yeah.

1498
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:10,100
Yeah.
I was a St Lucia or someplace like that 

1499
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:11,470
and they had a table there and no one 
knew what they were doing.

1500
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:13,110
Yeah,
there's a,

1501
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:15,420
we used to have one,
um,

1502
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:16,070
that,
uh,

1503
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:20,270
they set up an executive and people from
like all these other kinds of,

1504
01:08:20,271 --> 01:08:22,400
like,
a lot of Mexican players would come in.

1505
01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:25,090
Guys who worked in the area who were,
um,

1506
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:28,340
Latino from some Latin American 
countries,

1507
01:08:28,341 --> 01:08:33,341
they'd come,
they'd be so happy to find a table like 

1508
01:08:33,341 --> 01:08:33,341
that.
Really.

1509
01:08:33,341 --> 01:08:34,840
Isn't it weird how some games just can 
last centuries?

1510
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:37,380
Yeah.
Like chess [inaudible] pool,

1511
01:08:37,970 --> 01:08:39,500
bace,
you know what I mean?

1512
01:08:39,501 --> 01:08:43,190
Like there's something to.
They just got it right.

1513
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:46,010
Yeah.
That it could last that long chest isn't

1514
01:08:46,011 --> 01:08:51,011
weird thing and amazing one in that 
regard because there's never been a 

1515
01:08:51,011 --> 01:08:51,011
game.
It's really come along.

1516
01:08:51,011 --> 01:08:52,510
That's become the,
uh,

1517
01:08:53,150 --> 01:08:56,180
any sort of a contender for the 
intellectual game.

1518
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:58,040
Right.
That is the intellectual.

1519
01:08:58,620 --> 01:08:59,930
Yeah.
Yeah.

1520
01:09:00,790 --> 01:09:02,200
And it's to ship made a run at it.

1521
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:09,260
You know,
chess is sick.

1522
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:14,760
It's also one game.
It's one of the few games where you 

1523
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:17,431
could tell people you play and they 
don't look at you like you're wasting 

1524
01:09:17,431 --> 01:09:17,431
your time.
Know you're right.

1525
01:09:17,431 --> 01:09:18,100
That's exactly right.
You're like,

1526
01:09:18,101 --> 01:09:18,760
oh,
okay.

1527
01:09:18,820 --> 01:09:23,820
Like even pool.
I got to tell people I love to play 

1528
01:09:23,820 --> 01:09:23,820
pool.
Right,

1529
01:09:23,820 --> 01:09:24,070
exactly.
Get home to your family,

1530
01:09:24,670 --> 01:09:29,670
right?
You tell people you're involved in a 

1531
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:30,010
chess tournament.
You're like,

1532
01:09:30,011 --> 01:09:31,470
wow,
he's a dedicated into electrical.

1533
01:09:31,690 --> 01:09:32,340
Tom.
Papa.

1534
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:36,670
Papa thinks it really is true.
Yeah.

1535
01:09:37,180 --> 01:09:38,950
I wish I knew more people.
We played chess.

1536
01:09:38,951 --> 01:09:40,900
I wish my,
I tried to get my daughter's into it,

1537
01:09:40,901 --> 01:09:43,810
but uh,
it's a cool thing to be able to do.

1538
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:46,990
Just so engrossing.
Good for your mind.

1539
01:09:46,991 --> 01:09:49,300
Yeah.
There was a guy,

1540
01:09:49,301 --> 01:09:53,880
I was on a movie once and the guy was 
renting his house out for you.

1541
01:09:54,070 --> 01:09:56,260
Ever seen how they do that?

1542
01:09:56,260 --> 01:09:57,790
Like people rent their house out for 
movies.

1543
01:09:57,791 --> 01:09:58,780
Yeah.
I used to know a guy,

1544
01:09:58,810 --> 01:10:03,810
that's how I paid his whole mortgage.
She had a cool house in the Hollywood 

1545
01:10:03,810 --> 01:10:05,110
hills and he just rented out to movie 
studios and TV studios and that's how he

1546
01:10:05,111 --> 01:10:10,111
paid his bills and they would only use 
it like a couple of days a month and 

1547
01:10:10,111 --> 01:10:10,300
that paid for everything.
But anyway,

1548
01:10:10,301 --> 01:10:15,160
this guy was a chess player and all he 
did was play chess really?

1549
01:10:15,161 --> 01:10:18,570
So we're hanging around with this guy 
and his house and I'm like,

1550
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:20,000
so you just played chess?
He was like,

1551
01:10:20,001 --> 01:10:20,980
yeah,
I play chess and I,

1552
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:21,550
I,
you know,

1553
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:23,920
I'm divorced so I don't need the whole 
house.

1554
01:10:23,921 --> 01:10:26,530
I rent the house out for movies and just
kind of fun.

1555
01:10:26,590 --> 01:10:28,390
I like watching movies,
get filmed in my house.

1556
01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:29,470
I'm like,
wow,

1557
01:10:29,471 --> 01:10:31,150
that's crazy because you had to kind of 
a cool house.

1558
01:10:31,450 --> 01:10:34,090
And so I went with them and like,
show me what you do.

1559
01:10:34,091 --> 01:10:34,570
He goes,
okay,

1560
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:40,020
well I'm about to get a game right now,
so I'll go to this forum and I'll say 

1561
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:44,520
who would like to have a game?
And then they meet up in this room and 

1562
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:45,280
then they play chess online.
Online.

1563
01:10:45,281 --> 01:10:46,990
Yeah.
And I was watching him play chess online

1564
01:10:46,991 --> 01:10:49,810
and that's apparently where the majority
of games get played.

1565
01:10:51,370 --> 01:10:56,370
Norton and I were starting to do that.
You could play against each other 

1566
01:10:56,370 --> 01:10:56,370
online.
Oh really?

1567
01:10:56,370 --> 01:10:57,550
Yeah.
And uh,

1568
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:59,380
it's cool,
but there's,

1569
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:05,120
I just the physical part,
it's like anything with online 

1570
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:05,120
newspapers,
whatever.

1571
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,790
I missed the physical moving the pieces.
Yeah.

1572
01:11:06,870 --> 01:11:08,220
Yeah.
But yeah,

1573
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:13,230
he was into it for for a bit.
Howard stern was into it to the point 

1574
01:11:13,230 --> 01:11:14,940
where he was taking lessons talking 
about it on the air all the time.

1575
01:11:14,990 --> 01:11:15,810
Oh really?
Yeah.

1576
01:11:15,830 --> 01:11:17,710
I think he probably decided it was just 
a mad.

1577
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:19,250
I mean he's,
it's a time suck.

1578
01:11:19,251 --> 01:11:20,280
Yeah,
it's a time suck.

1579
01:11:20,281 --> 01:11:25,281
And once I started being able to read in
the paper the moves and understand it,

1580
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:27,090
I was like,
I'm spending too much time.

1581
01:11:27,510 --> 01:11:30,900
I would say that's what I'm fucking 
balling me.

1582
01:11:30,930 --> 01:11:32,070
I'm so smart.
Oh,

1583
01:11:32,071 --> 01:11:37,071
King took six course.
The obvious Belgium variation.

1584
01:11:38,731 --> 01:11:41,580
Why is it in the paper?
Because it's fucking smart people.

1585
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:46,920
It's like,
it's like reading the box score to a 

1586
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:46,920
baseball game.
Well,

1587
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:50,391
it's always been in the paper.
That particular game that someone's 

1588
01:11:50,391 --> 01:11:50,890
playing that you're following along,
they're showing,

1589
01:11:50,891 --> 01:11:54,060
you know,
these two guys just played last night in

1590
01:11:54,061 --> 01:11:57,000
this big tournament or whatever.
Well maybe.

1591
01:11:57,310 --> 01:12:02,310
Has there ever been a newspaper that 
it'll show a move then ask you for the 

1592
01:12:02,310 --> 01:12:04,170
counter to that move and then you like,
you play the game out day after day?

1593
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:06,830
No,
no.

1594
01:12:07,130 --> 01:12:08,390
They want it to do it,
but then,

1595
01:12:08,391 --> 01:12:10,370
uh,
the Sukkot people blocked it.

1596
01:12:12,220 --> 01:12:15,980
The word find people were outraged.

1597
01:12:17,010 --> 01:12:18,010
What was the,
the,

1598
01:12:18,011 --> 01:12:18,690
the,
uh,

1599
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:21,690
conspiracy that we were talking about 
before the podcast started?

1600
01:12:21,691 --> 01:12:23,880
That we both thought was bullshit that 
you,

1601
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:26,850
you brought up.
Oh yeah.

1602
01:12:26,890 --> 01:12:29,520
The chipolte lay bullet thing.
Yeah.

1603
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:34,880
What's the chipotle?
A conspiracy as I was eating chipotle a 

1604
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:35,970
on this wacky diet.
Man I can be doing now.

1605
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,650
Any grains.
I'm on this.

1606
01:12:37,651 --> 01:12:42,651
It's called the primal blueprint diet.
And the idea behind it as no grains,

1607
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:44,910
no car,
like very low carbohydrates,

1608
01:12:44,911 --> 01:12:47,440
no sugar,
no processed sugar.

1609
01:12:47,710 --> 01:12:49,500
You can have like a piece of fruit every
now and then,

1610
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:54,740
but you wanted to bring your body into 
ketosis where your body burns off fat 

1611
01:12:54,930 --> 01:12:58,410
and everybody's doing.
Everybody's telling me not to do it.

1612
01:12:58,550 --> 01:12:59,660
Go.
This will work for this.

1613
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:00,600
I'm like,
have you done it?

1614
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:02,670
No,
but shut the fuck up.

1615
01:13:03,780 --> 01:13:05,940
Shut the fuck up.
Where did you hear about it?

1616
01:13:06,190 --> 01:13:07,970
We'll have this guy on.
His name's Mark Sisson.

1617
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:11,400
He's a pretty famous guy in the Paleo 
community.

1618
01:13:11,850 --> 01:13:12,700
He,
the,

1619
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,080
you know your term Paleolithic Diet?
Yeah.

1620
01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:15,570
Yeah.
Well,

1621
01:13:15,571 --> 01:13:17,200
that's actually kind of bullshit.
Yeah.

1622
01:13:18,010 --> 01:13:23,010
Well,
what's bullshit is Paleolithic people 

1623
01:13:23,010 --> 01:13:23,010
didn't really eat like that.
They they brands.

1624
01:13:23,010 --> 01:13:25,410
So what he's saying is like,
the name is wrong,

1625
01:13:25,950 --> 01:13:30,950
but the diet,
the principles of the Diet are really 

1626
01:13:30,950 --> 01:13:31,380
good for fighting inflammation for a lot
of people.

1627
01:13:31,381 --> 01:13:33,870
Like he had irritable bowel syndrome.
A lot of people,

1628
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:38,960
they find that it helps them with 
arthritis and a lot of it cures a lot of

1629
01:13:39,061 --> 01:13:41,760
inflammatory issues.
Not that I have them,

1630
01:13:42,150 --> 01:13:43,140
but I'm like,
okay,

1631
01:13:43,141 --> 01:13:48,141
well let's see what it's like.
And then I had this Guy Kyle Kingsbury 

1632
01:13:48,141 --> 01:13:48,141
on who's a former UFC fighter,
great athlete,

1633
01:13:48,141 --> 01:13:49,170
Great Guy,
very,

1634
01:13:49,171 --> 01:13:54,171
very smart.
And he was talking to me about it and 

1635
01:13:54,171 --> 01:13:54,930
one of the things that he said was he 
was citing the mental clarity aspects of

1636
01:13:54,931 --> 01:13:54,990
it.

1637
01:13:54,990 --> 01:13:57,330
He said it makes his mind functions 
better.

1638
01:13:57,331 --> 01:14:00,240
He has more energy.
He feels more even throughout the day.

1639
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:03,060
And then I talked to my car,
my brother Danny protocols,

1640
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:04,850
you know Danny Danny probe,
who,

1641
01:14:04,870 --> 01:14:08,850
who's a world champion Jujitsu player,
who's a good friend of mine,

1642
01:14:08,890 --> 01:14:11,560
found out that I was doing it and he 
said he's been on it since November.

1643
01:14:11,561 --> 01:14:14,050
And he also cited the mental clarity 
thing,

1644
01:14:14,140 --> 01:14:17,500
real and denny's,
a real physical culture wizard.

1645
01:14:17,501 --> 01:14:22,501
He's always on top of the latest and 
greatest of all the techniques and 

1646
01:14:22,501 --> 01:14:24,610
modalities as far as training and stuff 
like that.

1647
01:14:24,790 --> 01:14:27,550
So just no grains is the dominant 
fucking grains.

1648
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:31,750
Mostly fats like fats.
Like I eat a lot of Avocados.

1649
01:14:31,751 --> 01:14:34,300
I run mighty five,
fucking Avocados a day.

1650
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:39,550
Really?
I had two of these stake bowls from aaa 

1651
01:14:39,550 --> 01:14:43,060
today with just beans.
No,

1652
01:14:43,090 --> 01:14:46,420
no rice.
Just extra heaps of Guacamole.

1653
01:14:46,660 --> 01:14:50,440
And then I two giant things of Guacamole
on top of that.

1654
01:14:50,441 --> 01:14:55,080
So I'm just eating guacamole.
So steak bowl would have made.

1655
01:14:55,770 --> 01:15:00,770
He didn't mention did I said steak bowl.
But then you listed a stake taking it.

1656
01:15:02,250 --> 01:15:04,700
But you also took the right?
Yeah.

1657
01:15:04,850 --> 01:15:05,650
That just.
No,

1658
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:10,680
just no rice beans set.
I'm just eating boring shit when I go to

1659
01:15:12,390 --> 01:15:13,240
the meat.
Is Great,

1660
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:15,910
but when I go to a restaurant could 
fucking Lord.

1661
01:15:15,911 --> 01:15:20,911
It's hard to find things to eat.
Restaurants kill every diet no matter 

1662
01:15:20,911 --> 01:15:22,030
what.
No matter what you're trying to do,

1663
01:15:22,090 --> 01:15:25,660
restaurants are just bad place.
I went to this one place and I wanted to

1664
01:15:25,661 --> 01:15:27,790
get a nice salad and then I said,
wait a minute.

1665
01:15:27,820 --> 01:15:30,910
What's in the salad dressing?
Do you toss it in the side?

1666
01:15:30,970 --> 01:15:33,080
Yeah,
it comes already tossed in it.

1667
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:35,320
You might as well be eating candy,
right?

1668
01:15:35,350 --> 01:15:35,950
The side.
I'm like,

1669
01:15:35,951 --> 01:15:37,420
this is crazy.
I can't even eat this.

1670
01:15:37,421 --> 01:15:38,440
I go,
this is all sugar.

1671
01:15:38,441 --> 01:15:39,940
And like,
well there is some sugar and I go,

1672
01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:42,550
what?
Some of the fucking desert.

1673
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:44,170
Your Salads.
Goddamn desert.

1674
01:15:44,670 --> 01:15:49,670
It was glistening with syrup.
I'm not kidding.

1675
01:15:49,871 --> 01:15:50,830
I know,
I know.

1676
01:15:51,050 --> 01:15:53,290
That stuff's high calorie.
You have wood ranch.

1677
01:15:53,291 --> 01:15:54,630
Every wood ranch,
barbecue places,

1678
01:15:54,970 --> 01:15:56,610
they have this thing called a natalie 
salads.

1679
01:15:56,650 --> 01:15:58,720
Fucking delicious.
I love it,

1680
01:15:59,050 --> 01:16:01,240
but he might as well be eating an ice 
cream Sundae.

1681
01:16:02,430 --> 01:16:07,330
It's a salad that's discovered in syrup.
She's their salad dressing is syrup.

1682
01:16:07,390 --> 01:16:08,710
So how long have you been doing this 
diet?

1683
01:16:08,890 --> 01:16:09,820
Today is,
what is it,

1684
01:16:09,821 --> 01:16:12,940
Jamie Day nine,
nine.

1685
01:16:12,941 --> 01:16:14,050
I think.
I didn't have days.

1686
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:16,750
I feel great.
I know I've lost a little weight,

1687
01:16:17,050 --> 01:16:18,160
which uh,
you know,

1688
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:22,750
my body's always pretty much the same 
weight really gain or lose,

1689
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:26,050
but I did some things in the past that 
made me lose weight.

1690
01:16:26,050 --> 01:16:28,450
One of them was I cut all the sugar out 
of my diet.

1691
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:33,460
I lost five pounds in a week,
like doing nothing else but doing that 

1692
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:36,840
really it was crazy.
And then I went gluten free for a while 

1693
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:38,110
and that,
that helped me a lot.

1694
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:40,960
That made me feel like there was 
something going on to that,

1695
01:16:40,961 --> 01:16:44,350
like a energy levels felt good.
My skin look good,

1696
01:16:44,351 --> 01:16:47,980
like really healthy.
I think what that is though is the sugar

1697
01:16:47,981 --> 01:16:50,080
thing,
because I think with gluten,

1698
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:54,100
gluten is bread and pasta in Wheaton.
That stuff,

1699
01:16:54,101 --> 01:16:56,470
it's not like I had an issue with gluten
itself,

1700
01:16:56,850 --> 01:16:58,590
like I didn't have an issue processing 
gluten.

1701
01:16:58,730 --> 01:17:00,850
Right?
It's all converts to sugar,

1702
01:17:00,980 --> 01:17:03,040
right?
Like that's just a lot of sugar for your

1703
01:17:03,041 --> 01:17:08,041
body and your body just doesn't want 
that much sugar to process this 

1704
01:17:08,041 --> 01:17:09,800
essentially toxic and the more people 
are learning about sugar,

1705
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:15,160
the more people are coming to an 
agreement like almost all these 

1706
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:19,450
scientists and nutritional experts that 
come to an agreement like processed 

1707
01:17:19,450 --> 01:17:20,600
sugar is just fucking awful.
It's brutal.

1708
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:23,870
It's really bad and it's in everything.
Everything.

1709
01:17:24,110 --> 01:17:26,960
Everything.
I've been baking bread lately.

1710
01:17:27,050 --> 01:17:29,330
Holy Shit.
Sourdough bread.

1711
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:31,420
Sourdough bread is very good for you.
It is.

1712
01:17:31,430 --> 01:17:34,130
Has Gluten though.
Natural process.

1713
01:17:34,190 --> 01:17:39,190
Yeah,
but sour dough bread apparently has way 

1714
01:17:39,190 --> 01:17:42,251
less gluten than regular bread right 
here because my wife can eat that 

1715
01:17:42,251 --> 01:17:43,520
mechanic.
The other brand really?

1716
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:46,140
It's a cool thing.
It just takes the.

1717
01:17:46,150 --> 01:17:48,680
You just take flour and water.
You need a starter,

1718
01:17:49,310 --> 01:17:51,420
which is culture.
Yeah.

1719
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:56,540
You just start with flour and water and 
the natural yeast that comes from around

1720
01:17:56,570 --> 01:18:00,110
us in the environment goes in and starts
eating that.

1721
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:03,260
What?
And it becomes a living thing and people

1722
01:18:03,261 --> 01:18:06,620
have starters that are like 100 years 
old wax you take,

1723
01:18:06,830 --> 01:18:11,830
you take a couple ounces off and you 
always maintain a little and feed it 

1724
01:18:11,830 --> 01:18:11,830
like a living thing.

1725
01:18:11,830 --> 01:18:13,420
It's like a bowl of flour and water,
but it's,

1726
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:17,790
you'll see it start to bubble when you 
feed it more flour and water receding.

1727
01:18:17,820 --> 01:18:19,370
Yeah,
it's the coolest.

1728
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:21,950
That's crazy.
So it's in your refrigerator.

1729
01:18:22,110 --> 01:18:22,870
In my fridge.
Oh,

1730
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:24,890
a little little.
A Mason Jar.

1731
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:30,920
And then you scoop it out,
you take a little chunk of it in the 

1732
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:34,001
feed it and it expands.
And then you take some of that and make 

1733
01:18:34,001 --> 01:18:34,820
bread out of it.
That is fucking nuts.

1734
01:18:34,850 --> 01:18:36,110
It's pretty.
Yeah.

1735
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:39,950
So never would have been into this if I 
didn't hear that concept.

1736
01:18:39,951 --> 01:18:43,990
And now I can stop baking bread,
like Little Red Riding Hood.

1737
01:18:45,620 --> 01:18:48,920
Who gave you the idea to do this?
This writer friend of mine,

1738
01:18:49,010 --> 01:18:51,260
he's been doing it for a long time and 
he said it's just,

1739
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:53,330
you just have sourdough bread and the 
kids love it.

1740
01:18:53,331 --> 01:18:56,330
And Wow.
I just started doing it and uh,

1741
01:18:57,020 --> 01:18:58,250
I just got hooked on it.

1742
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:00,920
Where do you buy your starter?
You don't buy it.

1743
01:19:00,980 --> 01:19:03,440
You can just start it.
You make a starter,

1744
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:04,970
make a starter.
Okay.

1745
01:19:04,971 --> 01:19:09,971
How do you do that?
You just take some flour and water and 

1746
01:19:09,971 --> 01:19:10,640
put it out on the,
on the,

1747
01:19:10,641 --> 01:19:11,510
uh,
counter.

1748
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:12,620
That's it.
Yeah.

1749
01:19:12,740 --> 01:19:15,050
I mean there's measurements and stuff,
but that's it.

1750
01:19:15,710 --> 01:19:20,710
And then the natural yeast,
there's yeast around us just floating 

1751
01:19:20,710 --> 01:19:22,820
around that explains a lot of things.
The APP and it goes into,

1752
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:24,710
it goes into the,
uh,

1753
01:19:25,310 --> 01:19:29,150
into the concoction and you'll see it 
starts to bubble and get lighter and you

1754
01:19:29,151 --> 01:19:32,150
feed it some more and it gets bigger.
When you say feed it like for you,

1755
01:19:32,470 --> 01:19:34,430
because it's,
it's like a yeast,

1756
01:19:34,580 --> 01:19:39,580
a little,
like a little community feeding you 

1757
01:19:39,580 --> 01:19:41,250
equal parts of flour and water.
Wow.

1758
01:19:41,390 --> 01:19:45,500
And it eats it and now it's like this 
living thing in the house who has a star

1759
01:19:45,501 --> 01:19:46,460
that's 100 years old.

1760
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:51,880
I went to buy a Dutch oven,
which is like a pot that you can bake 

1761
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:55,790
that we put the bread in and this old 
guy was like,

1762
01:19:56,060 --> 01:19:59,420
what are you doing?
Even the guy will sit down with like six

1763
01:19:59,421 --> 01:20:02,060
foot lanky.
What do you need it for?

1764
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:04,100
I'm like,
I'm going to make some bread.

1765
01:20:04,660 --> 01:20:07,070
Oh,
I've been making bread for a long time.

1766
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:10,770
Really?
I'm going to be making sourdough bread.

1767
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,980
Oh,
I got my start and where are you getting

1768
01:20:13,981 --> 01:20:15,060
your starter?
I said,

1769
01:20:15,061 --> 01:20:20,061
well,
a friend of mine has the brightest 

1770
01:20:20,061 --> 01:20:20,280
starter and my daughter.
What labrea?

1771
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:25,400
What's the labrea starter?
That one is that all the brave labrea 

1772
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:29,600
bakery bread.
You get the yeast off of the skin of 

1773
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,680
grapes,
so he is a process where you take grapes

1774
01:20:31,681 --> 01:20:34,190
and you put it in like cheesecloth and 
you just let the.

1775
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:38,760
The yeast come off of all,
all grapes have yeast in the skin,

1776
01:20:39,270 --> 01:20:44,270
eating on the skin of the grapes and 
that drips off and then you put it into 

1777
01:20:44,270 --> 01:20:44,270
the basic.

1778
01:20:44,270 --> 01:20:45,660
Started with flour and water.
So it have you say liberal,

1779
01:20:45,690 --> 01:20:49,160
sweeter say chain.
Is that what you mean?

1780
01:20:49,170 --> 01:20:49,950
Like liberal,
yeah,

1781
01:20:49,951 --> 01:20:54,951
there's,
you'll see them there are actual bakery 

1782
01:20:54,951 --> 01:20:56,040
and now they're like in Ralph's and 
everything that's all over and they say,

1783
01:20:56,270 --> 01:20:59,700
and like the places San Francisco that 
have big sourdough,

1784
01:21:00,150 --> 01:21:02,400
that it all,
it's maintains the same.

1785
01:21:02,850 --> 01:21:05,580
Started that they've always had.
So this guy said,

1786
01:21:05,670 --> 01:21:10,670
uh,
so I told them where I was getting my 

1787
01:21:10,670 --> 01:21:12,680
stuff,
my daughter made one as a gift and then 

1788
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:14,961
this other guy gave me a piece.
He said his starter came from Jackson 

1789
01:21:14,961 --> 01:21:19,700
Hole,
Wyoming and he got it from a friend of 

1790
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:23,361
his and it's over 100 years old.
People have been passing it on to cowboy

1791
01:21:24,611 --> 01:21:26,010
starter.
Cowboy started.

1792
01:21:26,070 --> 01:21:31,070
That's what it was.
It was a lot of miners in San Francisco 

1793
01:21:31,070 --> 01:21:34,911
and all that.
During the gold rush they were creating 

1794
01:21:34,911 --> 01:21:34,920
bred that way.
That's where it started.

1795
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:41,790
Yeah.
I wonder how old the yeast organisms get

1796
01:21:41,791 --> 01:21:46,020
before they die and do they die?
They probably reproduce in.

1797
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:47,250
Yeah.
It's a good question.

1798
01:21:48,270 --> 01:21:52,470
I don't know because basically like I 
have it on my counter nab and feeding it

1799
01:21:52,471 --> 01:21:53,850
for the last day,
so now,

1800
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:56,340
so now it's kind of bubbly.
Wow.

1801
01:21:56,370 --> 01:22:00,690
It's like glue and it's kind of bubbly,
so I'll scoop out four ounces of that,

1802
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:05,520
make bread out of it,
and then take one ounce of that,

1803
01:22:05,521 --> 01:22:10,521
put it back in the jar,
feed it a little and put it in the 

1804
01:22:10,521 --> 01:22:10,521
fridge.
So what's the process?

1805
01:22:10,521 --> 01:22:12,360
So if you took four ounces out and made 
bread with it,

1806
01:22:12,390 --> 01:22:14,310
what do you do with that?
The starter,

1807
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:18,390
uh,
you basically take a lot of flour.

1808
01:22:18,450 --> 01:22:22,440
You take like 28,
this is to make two of them two loaves.

1809
01:22:22,441 --> 01:22:27,441
You take a,
a 28 ounces of all purpose flour or 

1810
01:22:27,441 --> 01:22:28,770
wheat flour,
whatever you want to use.

1811
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:31,860
You put that in with a little salt.
Then you take your starter,

1812
01:22:31,861 --> 01:22:35,160
you take the four ounces and an 18 
ounces of water,

1813
01:22:35,161 --> 01:22:37,410
a bunch of water,
and you make it into a cloudy mixture.

1814
01:22:38,220 --> 01:22:43,220
And then you dump that into the flour 
and salt that's in your mixer and it 

1815
01:22:43,220 --> 01:22:46,080
just makes it into dough.
And then it just rises naturally.

1816
01:22:46,260 --> 01:22:49,200
Bold it a couple times,
put it into a ball,

1817
01:22:49,230 --> 01:22:51,960
into the Dutch oven after a couple of 
hours,

1818
01:22:51,961 --> 01:22:54,300
and then you've got bread.
It's that simple.

1819
01:22:54,330 --> 01:22:59,330
It's that simple.
How long before you start growing your 

1820
01:22:59,330 --> 01:23:00,240
own wheat and smashing up with a rock?
Probably I'm.

1821
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:05,320
I'm headed that way.
That is where the guy who worry about 

1822
01:23:05,471 --> 01:23:06,040
the Dutch oven

1823
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:11,040
from is like,
I really like seed breads and then I 

1824
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:13,210
looked it up.
That's like crazy.

1825
01:23:13,211 --> 01:23:18,211
Like 12 different seeds from different 
places and you mash them up and then 

1826
01:23:18,251 --> 01:23:23,251
you're getting a job at Williams sonoma.
I went to the Museum of natural history.

1827
01:23:23,940 --> 01:23:26,980
They have a,
an Egyptian mummy display.

1828
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:28,610
Really fucking cool.
Yeah,

1829
01:23:29,230 --> 01:23:33,190
but one of the interesting things was by
the time Egyptian people were older,

1830
01:23:33,250 --> 01:23:34,630
you know,
they didn't leave that live that long,

1831
01:23:34,631 --> 01:23:39,631
but if they did,
they didn't have any teeth left because 

1832
01:23:39,631 --> 01:23:40,690
the way they made bread,
they grounded up.

1833
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:44,110
They ground up their own flour and it 
left sand in the bread.

1834
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:52,870
So the bread was all you were eating,
sand were away your teeth.

1835
01:23:53,050 --> 01:23:54,970
That's gross.
I thought you were going to say sugar.

1836
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:56,820
No sand.
Oh,

1837
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:01,350
wear your teeth down time.
The down Arabs.

1838
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:06,670
And they had all these methods that they
were trying to concoct to save teeth,

1839
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:11,700
like wooden caps,
that they would put a shoe on that 

1840
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:15,100
instead of chewing with whatever nerve 
endings were left in your face,

1841
01:24:15,190 --> 01:24:18,590
just so you could eat more.
Sam Breads Sandy Bread fucked.

1842
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:23,900
Oh,
it is a kind of a trippy thing that you 

1843
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:26,200
just put some flour and water and this 
yeast comes from the environment and now

1844
01:24:26,201 --> 01:24:31,201
you've got this amazing tasting bread 
that the family can't stop eating.

1845
01:24:31,751 --> 01:24:36,430
The kids cutting it.
It's just has been around for ever right

1846
01:24:36,431 --> 01:24:38,210
out of the oven when it's.

1847
01:24:41,070 --> 01:24:46,070
We're eating bread like crazy.
Like when you're talking about like 

1848
01:24:46,070 --> 01:24:46,360
eating sugar and all that flat.
We just can't stop.

1849
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:47,580
Wow.
We're all going to be fun.

1850
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,540
I'm going the other way.
I'm not eating any of it.

1851
01:24:50,050 --> 01:24:52,210
At least for 60 days I'm going to.
I don't feel.

1852
01:24:52,650 --> 01:24:57,650
I don't feel mentally clear.
Have you made some life choices they 

1853
01:24:58,370 --> 01:25:03,370
regret?
I told you I woke up at seven this 

1854
01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:03,370
morning.
Like,

1855
01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:03,370
oh,
I got to do a show tonight.

1856
01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:06,340
And that's the bread is the bread is 
bread.

1857
01:25:06,341 --> 01:25:08,070
It's making me.
Laying you down.

1858
01:25:08,910 --> 01:25:10,870
So weird man.
Yeah.

1859
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:15,900
So weird that you could just like put it
out there and the natural yeast grows.

1860
01:25:16,151 --> 01:25:18,640
I had no idea.
I felt like it.

1861
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:24,000
You know what I wish someone had asked 
me where does it come from because I 

1862
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,340
never considered it before.
I would have been like a fucking.

1863
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:28,780
What is it?
A plant.

1864
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:30,520
What is,
I don't know.

1865
01:25:30,521 --> 01:25:31,810
And then there's like,
you know,

1866
01:25:31,811 --> 01:25:36,811
because you can buy yeast that just make
regular bread and you throw it in there 

1867
01:25:36,811 --> 01:25:39,721
and it eats wow.
Own maintains a hundred and 22 year old 

1868
01:25:39,721 --> 01:25:40,990
sourdough starter.
Yeah.

1869
01:25:40,991 --> 01:25:41,860
Look at that.
Whoa.

1870
01:25:41,890 --> 01:25:46,890
There was a woman on line who's this?
Radical feminists who made sourdough 

1871
01:25:46,890 --> 01:25:47,820
bread out of her pussy east.

1872
01:25:50,470 --> 01:25:51,550
Yeah.
Go find that one.

1873
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:53,400
Jim couldn't keep their hands off it.
Oh,

1874
01:25:53,410 --> 01:25:56,140
it was fucking flying off the shelves.
Yeah.

1875
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:59,290
I tweeted about it,
but it was quite awhile ago.

1876
01:25:59,291 --> 01:26:01,360
Probably never find it,
but I was like,

1877
01:26:01,361 --> 01:26:02,980
good for her.
There is.

1878
01:26:02,990 --> 01:26:05,270
I can't tell you.
It's really a weird thing.

1879
01:26:05,510 --> 01:26:06,400
I mean,
who haven't never.

1880
01:26:06,410 --> 01:26:09,020
I've never be bacon bread.
Now I'm like hooked on it.

1881
01:26:10,390 --> 01:26:15,390
Yeah.
There is a woman who made sourdough 

1882
01:26:15,390 --> 01:26:15,530
bread using yeast from her vagina,
just ate the bread.

1883
01:26:18,220 --> 01:26:23,220
Why wouldn't she know I would eat a 
donut.

1884
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:33,410
Gross.
Why is it so gross when I eat it?

1885
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:36,170
But when my wife swallows it,
it's all gravy.

1886
01:26:36,860 --> 01:26:40,520
That's a good relationship to committed.
So life is built?

1887
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:41,980
Yeah,
it's a compromise.

1888
01:26:43,150 --> 01:26:45,110
Yeah.
So I'm baking bread and getting fat.

1889
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:46,310
What else you doing?
Growing?

1890
01:26:46,350 --> 01:26:48,260
Anything in your garden?
You one of those guys?

1891
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:48,950
No,
no,

1892
01:26:49,220 --> 01:26:50,870
no.
We're surrounded by bamboo.

1893
01:26:50,930 --> 01:26:54,770
I hadn't had a bone arrow.
Bamboo just cost me five grand.

1894
01:26:54,890 --> 01:26:56,630
What?
Why?

1895
01:26:57,200 --> 01:26:58,580
Well,
once we had the reins,

1896
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:00,860
nothing was draining off the property 
properly.

1897
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:02,470
So,
uh,

1898
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:06,980
they started looking at the drainage 
pipes and stuff.

1899
01:27:06,981 --> 01:27:10,110
And the guys who built it didn't 
fastened them together at one point.

1900
01:27:10,190 --> 01:27:13,670
Oh,
gram bu has grown into.

1901
01:27:13,970 --> 01:27:15,620
It's like a log.
I mean,

1902
01:27:15,621 --> 01:27:18,260
I never saw it this thick like sign that
just happened.

1903
01:27:18,590 --> 01:27:21,710
It's massive.
I had a root growing in my pipe.

1904
01:27:21,770 --> 01:27:23,930
CV can find that.
That was online,

1905
01:27:24,550 --> 01:27:27,210
like a toilet route.
It looked like a group,

1906
01:27:27,730 --> 01:27:30,140
like the guy was pulling a Gofer out of 
my toilet.

1907
01:27:30,890 --> 01:27:35,890
There was actually,
this is what happened when we moved to 

1908
01:27:35,890 --> 01:27:35,900
Colorado for a bit.
Um,

1909
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:41,080
I didn't use that bathroom obviously 
because we were there for like four 

1910
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:41,080
months.
Right.

1911
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:45,550
And so the,
the thing had apparently been in the 

1912
01:27:45,550 --> 01:27:45,550
toilet.

1913
01:27:45,550 --> 01:27:46,160
There it is.
That's from my own bathroom.

1914
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:49,520
That's the bathroom in my office.
Oh my God.

1915
01:27:49,550 --> 01:27:52,580
That thing.
This guy is holding it up right now.

1916
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:54,740
I'm sending you.
Is that solid or was that.

1917
01:27:54,741 --> 01:27:59,741
Was that fibrous?
What does that flicker can send me that 

1918
01:27:59,741 --> 01:28:03,431
photo so I can put it up on Instagram,
but because I always forget about this,

1919
01:28:03,620 --> 01:28:06,170
I need to put it up somewhere.
Show people.

1920
01:28:06,410 --> 01:28:09,380
But that fucking thing it looked like if
you see how thick it is,

1921
01:28:09,381 --> 01:28:11,180
it looks like he's pulling a Muskrat 
out.

1922
01:28:11,210 --> 01:28:13,700
It looks like some kind of a weasel or 
something.

1923
01:28:13,701 --> 01:28:15,410
How long was it?
Fucking huge.

1924
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:18,770
It's like four feet long.
At least you start to get scared of it.

1925
01:28:18,771 --> 01:28:20,600
You're like,
this stuff is really invasive.

1926
01:28:20,601 --> 01:28:23,060
Like it could really do some damage.
Oh yeah.

1927
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:26,330
It's not good with this beautiful bread.
Wow.

1928
01:28:26,331 --> 01:28:27,110
That's your bread.

1929
01:28:27,350 --> 01:28:29,030
It's pretty good.
That's amazing.

1930
01:28:29,450 --> 01:28:31,160
That looks excellent.
It's good.

1931
01:28:31,250 --> 01:28:36,250
It makes me want to break my diet.
That was like one of my first ones and 

1932
01:28:36,250 --> 01:28:36,250
this is the starter.
Have you gotten better at it?

1933
01:28:36,410 --> 01:28:41,410
Yeah,
fortunately we got to get back on the 

1934
01:28:41,410 --> 01:28:41,720
road home.
Baking bread.

1935
01:28:42,260 --> 01:28:43,820
This is a lot of starter.
Oh,

1936
01:28:43,821 --> 01:28:48,821
okay.
Just since before I knew what I was 

1937
01:28:48,821 --> 01:28:48,821
doing,
I was growing a lot of it.

1938
01:28:48,821 --> 01:28:50,020
Now you just need like a little bit.
Was this just like,

1939
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:52,190
do you have a burning desire to do this?
Like,

1940
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:54,200
no,
my friend told me about it,

1941
01:28:54,201 --> 01:28:57,830
that he was doing it and I came home at 
dinner,

1942
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:02,840
told my wife and kids about it and then 
for Christmas my daughter started a 

1943
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:08,420
starter.
She went off in youtube and figured out 

1944
01:29:08,420 --> 01:29:10,500
how to do it and then for her presence 
she gave me some starter.

1945
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,000
Oh,
that's so cute.

1946
01:29:12,001 --> 01:29:17,001
So sweet.
So we started making bread off of that 

1947
01:29:17,001 --> 01:29:17,001
and then my other friend who turned me 
onto it originally,

1948
01:29:17,001 --> 01:29:21,090
he brought me a little of the bravest 
starter creatures.

1949
01:29:21,150 --> 01:29:26,150
Yeah.
Have you thought about experimenting 

1950
01:29:26,150 --> 01:29:26,150
with different starters,
like the grape starter?

1951
01:29:26,150 --> 01:29:28,260
The starter,
the pussy ones.

1952
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:31,920
Intriguing.
I didn't know about it until just now.

1953
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:35,980
That's the show's good for now.
Uh,

1954
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:41,010
it now maybe grow my own weed.
That would be good.

1955
01:29:41,220 --> 01:29:43,330
Now it's pretty safe.
Pretty safe to grow.

1956
01:29:43,331 --> 01:29:44,550
You don't really get in trouble for 
that.

1957
01:29:44,551 --> 01:29:45,280
Now.
Fornia,

1958
01:29:45,750 --> 01:29:47,280
Texas,
you can go to jail forever.

1959
01:29:47,310 --> 01:29:52,310
You can so stupid forever.
They can fucking lock if they found you 

1960
01:29:52,310 --> 01:29:57,171
with a giant plant that not only that,
like say if you have a plant in the 

1961
01:29:57,171 --> 01:29:58,920
plants and dirt and the dirt and a pot.
They were the whole thing together.

1962
01:29:59,070 --> 01:30:02,850
So if you have a big heavy clay pot at 
the end,

1963
01:30:02,851 --> 01:30:05,760
the dirt that it goes in,
you might have 50 pounds of weed.

1964
01:30:06,130 --> 01:30:11,130
She,
well you really don't even have a pound 

1965
01:30:11,130 --> 01:30:11,130
of weed.
Oh my God,

1966
01:30:11,130 --> 01:30:12,930
that's probably a male class.
I grew it in college.

1967
01:30:12,931 --> 01:30:15,390
We had a house and we had like a walk in
closet.

1968
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:18,330
Oh really?
Because the happy days.

1969
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:22,130
Yeah.
Just seeing it come alive and knowing,

1970
01:30:22,220 --> 01:30:27,220
you know,
in school you had no money to even buy 

1971
01:30:27,220 --> 01:30:27,220
it and then we'll all of a sudden we 
were growing.

1972
01:30:27,220 --> 01:30:30,150
It is great.
That is not to sell just for ourselves.

1973
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:31,130
Good.
Oh,

1974
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:32,490
it was beautiful.
It was beautiful.

1975
01:30:32,491 --> 01:30:34,410
That would be a nice thing to grow.
That's a good idea.

1976
01:30:34,411 --> 01:30:36,150
Until your kids find it.
Yeah.

1977
01:30:36,270 --> 01:30:40,290
Then you got to explain.
I know know daddy's funny and silly.

1978
01:30:42,150 --> 01:30:46,240
Daddy's enhanced.
It was natural for awhile,

1979
01:30:46,290 --> 01:30:49,770
but now he's got to keep it going with I
knew a guy who had a um,

1980
01:30:49,950 --> 01:30:54,950
a dispensary and in the back room of the
dispensary it was a very large room 

1981
01:30:54,950 --> 01:30:58,020
where they were growing weed and I went 
into the room and it was like we'd those

1982
01:30:58,021 --> 01:31:03,021
like five feet high,
five foot high plants and all these 

1983
01:31:03,021 --> 01:31:03,021
lights and everything.

1984
01:31:03,021 --> 01:31:05,820
And I swear to God it felt like you were
going into a room filled with people.

1985
01:31:06,390 --> 01:31:09,060
Like there was like an intelligence in 
that room.

1986
01:31:09,090 --> 01:31:11,090
Really very strange.
Really.

1987
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:16,100
Granted I was hiding.
It must have been really when I walked 

1988
01:31:16,100 --> 01:31:19,881
in there,
but I do really think there's something 

1989
01:31:19,881 --> 01:31:19,881
to it.
It was something to that room.

1990
01:31:19,881 --> 01:31:20,160
I was like,
wow,

1991
01:31:20,161 --> 01:31:22,530
this room feels like there's things in 
here.

1992
01:31:22,700 --> 01:31:24,820
Like it doesn't seem like a room.
Full plant.

1993
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:29,840
Yeah.
Like you can go into a room full of 

1994
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:29,840
plants.
You're like,

1995
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:29,840
oh,
this is beautiful vegetation.

1996
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:30,110
Yeah.
But this is like,

1997
01:31:30,210 --> 01:31:31,860
you know,
full of hello.

1998
01:31:33,290 --> 01:31:38,290
It was very weird that it's like,
I totally get that you really start to 

1999
01:31:38,290 --> 01:31:42,201
care for them too.
It really seems insane that you don't 

2000
01:31:42,201 --> 01:31:46,281
own a dispensary.
It's like me and anybody with anybody 

2001
01:31:46,281 --> 01:31:48,110
with a brain living in California,
it's like you see in,

2002
01:31:48,111 --> 01:31:53,111
you know,
Denver print money to change that city 

2003
01:31:53,111 --> 01:31:55,770
and people are making so much money.
We're talking about going into.

2004
01:31:56,710 --> 01:31:57,490
Oh yeah,
yeah.

2005
01:31:57,530 --> 01:32:00,000
We've considered starting in Denver,

2006
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:05,010
perhaps some sort of an edible factory.
Really hire mercenaries.

2007
01:32:08,470 --> 01:32:13,470
What do I got?
You gotta hire mercenaries and I'm not 

2008
01:32:13,470 --> 01:32:13,940
joking if you want to do that.
It's all cash.

2009
01:32:13,941 --> 01:32:15,280
It's all cash.
Um,

2010
01:32:15,570 --> 01:32:19,000
you're,
you're dealing with a lot of people that

2011
01:32:19,180 --> 01:32:21,910
know that this is like essentially like 
a bank they can rob,

2012
01:32:21,911 --> 01:32:26,911
but it has much less security and for 
the longest time people were being 

2013
01:32:26,911 --> 01:32:31,291
forced to take these cash drops and take
him to banks and banks weren't even 

2014
01:32:31,751 --> 01:32:36,751
taking them.
So then they would have to take them to 

2015
01:32:36,751 --> 01:32:38,581
banks and convert them to like a 
traveler's check or something along 

2016
01:32:38,581 --> 01:32:38,581
those lines.
Like there was a bunch of different work

2017
01:32:38,581 --> 01:32:40,300
around so they had to.
Some banks do.

2018
01:32:41,060 --> 01:32:43,900
Banks are taking it now though.
I don't know what the fuck they're doing

2019
01:32:43,901 --> 01:32:48,901
now.
I don't think there's the real issue is 

2020
01:32:48,901 --> 01:32:51,190
if some fucking Wackadoo like Ted Cruz 
actually becomes the president,

2021
01:32:52,090 --> 01:32:54,790
which is not outside of the realm of 
possibility.

2022
01:32:54,790 --> 01:32:57,040
Phillips,
this is one of the scariest elections in

2023
01:32:57,041 --> 01:33:02,041
recent memory for me,
I think is the most scary because I 

2024
01:33:02,041 --> 01:33:03,970
don't think that people are willing to 
vote for Hillary Clinton.

2025
01:33:04,150 --> 01:33:06,730
I not only do I not think that people 
are willing to vote for her.

2026
01:33:06,731 --> 01:33:08,050
I think that,
uh,

2027
01:33:08,110 --> 01:33:13,110
I don't even think.
I think the people that are willing to 

2028
01:33:13,110 --> 01:33:15,541
vote for her are only willing to vote 
for her because she's a woman and they 

2029
01:33:15,541 --> 01:33:15,541
go,
let's,

2030
01:33:15,541 --> 01:33:15,541
let's see if chicks can do it,
you know,

2031
01:33:15,541 --> 01:33:17,470
or I want a woman in office,
Yay.

2032
01:33:17,660 --> 01:33:20,290
I get that kind of thing,
but she's not compelling as a leader.

2033
01:33:20,291 --> 01:33:24,070
She's just not now.
Now Bernie Sanders is interesting.

2034
01:33:24,490 --> 01:33:26,380
He's very interesting.
He's very interesting.

2035
01:33:26,381 --> 01:33:28,650
Socially,
he's very interesting in that he's.

2036
01:33:28,651 --> 01:33:33,651
He's just,
he's way more a man of a people of the 

2037
01:33:33,651 --> 01:33:37,021
people than anybody else.
And people like he's a career 

2038
01:33:37,021 --> 01:33:37,021
politician.

2039
01:33:37,021 --> 01:33:37,021
You.
Yeah,

2040
01:33:37,021 --> 01:33:41,131
but this fucking guy is.
He's so different than any other career 

2041
01:33:41,131 --> 01:33:41,730
politician that's running for office.
So he is.

2042
01:33:41,770 --> 01:33:46,770
He's the most intriguing,
interesting and intriguing to me along 

2043
01:33:46,770 --> 01:33:49,681
with trump and trump.
Although he says a lot of really stupid 

2044
01:33:49,681 --> 01:33:51,910
things and he's ridiculous and he's his 
ego's out of control.

2045
01:33:51,911 --> 01:33:54,910
And the shit that he says about Mexicans
is deplorable.

2046
01:33:55,570 --> 01:34:00,570
He's so wealthy that he can do whatever 
the fuck he wants and he's using all of 

2047
01:34:00,570 --> 01:34:05,041
his own money to fund this campaign and 
he won't be a puppet the same way that 

2048
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:09,370
Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio or any of these 
other guys on the right.

2049
01:34:09,371 --> 01:34:13,250
Will those guys scare the fuck out of me
that Ted Cruz guy scares the fuck out of

2050
01:34:13,260 --> 01:34:14,320
him.
He's really framing.

2051
01:34:14,380 --> 01:34:16,390
He's so dumb,
but he's not dumb.

2052
01:34:16,450 --> 01:34:17,310
That's what scary.
He's,

2053
01:34:17,311 --> 01:34:17,600
uh,
he's,

2054
01:34:17,650 --> 01:34:22,650
he's very smart as far as education.
But the shit that he says and Oh my God,

2055
01:34:23,411 --> 01:34:28,411
I think the Hillary thing though,
there's also a majority of people who 

2056
01:34:29,740 --> 01:34:34,170
from that party who will vote to keep 
things going on the Obama track.

2057
01:34:34,171 --> 01:34:36,850
Yeah.
I think that there's enough of that that

2058
01:34:36,851 --> 01:34:40,540
just kind of Grin and bear voting for 
Hillary,

2059
01:34:40,630 --> 01:34:42,670
Hillary Clinton versus Putin.
I mean,

2060
01:34:42,740 --> 01:34:47,740
who knows what the fuck happens if Putin
decides to ramp it up because hillary 

2061
01:34:47,740 --> 01:34:49,180
becomes president.
That's pretty tough though.

2062
01:34:49,181 --> 01:34:50,920
She,
she had that job.

2063
01:34:54,270 --> 01:34:54,970
She,
you know,

2064
01:34:55,750 --> 01:34:58,280
she had that job.
Faccia wasn't a pushover,

2065
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:01,550
right?
She wasn't,

2066
01:35:01,750 --> 01:35:03,610
she wasn't nasty,
real queen,

2067
01:35:05,180 --> 01:35:07,560
whatever the fuck she was.
I don't know man,

2068
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:10,850
that little promise.
She just so non compelling to me.

2069
01:35:10,851 --> 01:35:12,380
There's nothing she says.
It's interesting.

2070
01:35:12,790 --> 01:35:17,790
A great photo that I put up on instagram
that somebody made of the difference 

2071
01:35:17,790 --> 01:35:20,390
between Bernie Sanders and Hillary 
Clinton in regard to their response.

2072
01:35:20,391 --> 01:35:22,310
Like what is the olive garden like?
How do,

2073
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:25,950
how do you feel about the olive garden?
It's funny,

2074
01:35:26,420 --> 01:35:29,390
I'll show Jamie pull it up because it's 
so hilarious.

2075
01:35:29,391 --> 01:35:32,870
But it is how I feel about Hillary 
Clinton.

2076
01:35:32,871 --> 01:35:36,740
Like I feel like she's.
Yeah,

2077
01:35:36,830 --> 01:35:38,540
I know,
but you know what?

2078
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:41,120
It's politics,
but she's also boring.

2079
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:46,240
Yeah.
And I think that is something you kind 

2080
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:46,400
of appreciate when they're in office.
Really?

2081
01:35:46,430 --> 01:35:50,060
Yes.
Obama's kind of boring and wonkish any,

2082
01:35:50,210 --> 01:35:53,840
but it just kinda no drama.
No big.

2083
01:35:53,841 --> 01:35:58,841
I mean this is kind of,
I'm talking against her at the same 

2084
01:35:58,841 --> 01:35:58,841
time,
but with Obama there was no scandal.

2085
01:35:58,910 --> 01:36:03,910
There was no do surgery,
there was no things taking us off track 

2086
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:06,210
day just kind of went to work 
methodically.

2087
01:36:06,211 --> 01:36:07,910
It wasn't flashy,
wasn't exciting,

2088
01:36:07,911 --> 01:36:12,911
but it's improved.
Here it is all garden and authentic 

2089
01:36:13,671 --> 01:36:17,000
Italian restaurant for the whole family 
says Hillary Bernie.

2090
01:36:17,210 --> 01:36:21,080
Only when I'm high,
I don't make sense.

2091
01:36:21,150 --> 01:36:23,210
It totally.
Yeah.

2092
01:36:23,211 --> 01:36:26,810
There's a whole group.
I just think that um,

2093
01:36:27,470 --> 01:36:29,960
this is just,
there's no one that really grabs me.

2094
01:36:29,961 --> 01:36:34,070
Like Al Know Al Gore when he was running
opposite of Bush was compelling.

2095
01:36:34,460 --> 01:36:39,460
I'm like,
here's a guy who cares a lot about the 

2096
01:36:39,460 --> 01:36:39,460
environment.
You know,

2097
01:36:39,460 --> 01:36:39,460
people is,
oh,

2098
01:36:39,460 --> 01:36:42,661
he's bullshit.
That movie an inconvenient truth is 

2099
01:36:42,661 --> 01:36:43,580
filled with books and bullshit and lies 
and propaganda.

2100
01:36:43,790 --> 01:36:47,870
Not One question about climate change in
the Republican debates.

2101
01:36:48,170 --> 01:36:50,240
Yeah.
They want to keep the that on the DL.

2102
01:36:50,270 --> 01:36:52,280
Not One pill.
Addictions,

2103
01:36:52,670 --> 01:36:54,470
like we're saying,
pharmaceutical addictions,

2104
01:36:54,890 --> 01:36:58,520
cigarettes.
I mean if there was a drug that just got

2105
01:36:58,521 --> 01:37:00,560
released that's killing as many people,
cigarettes,

2106
01:37:00,561 --> 01:37:02,390
that would be the number one hot topic 
for debate.

2107
01:37:02,940 --> 01:37:05,750
If there was a,
a disease like the Zika virus,

2108
01:37:05,751 --> 01:37:08,360
it was killing a half million people.
It would be the number one hot,

2109
01:37:08,361 --> 01:37:13,361
huge topic of debate.
Half a million people a year in this 

2110
01:37:13,361 --> 01:37:16,331
country alone.
But cigarettes skirt right under the 

2111
01:37:16,331 --> 01:37:16,331
radar.
Yeah.

2112
01:37:16,331 --> 01:37:16,880
It's because the amount of money they 
contribute.

2113
01:37:16,910 --> 01:37:18,770
Yeah.
Same thing with pharmaceutical drugs.

2114
01:37:19,270 --> 01:37:21,970
The heroin problem in New Hampshire.
Right?

2115
01:37:22,450 --> 01:37:27,450
Well,
why do you think that drumming up such 

2116
01:37:27,450 --> 01:37:27,950
fear about all the terrorism is so good 
because these guys want to come.

2117
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:29,990
It's the same thing with the industrial 
complex.

2118
01:37:29,991 --> 01:37:33,950
They want to just.
Those guys spend a lot of money on those

2119
01:37:33,951 --> 01:37:38,951
politicians,
but you also know the whole reality of 

2120
01:37:38,951 --> 01:37:42,011
the New Hampshire heroin problem was 
entirely spawned entirely spawned by 

2121
01:37:42,681 --> 01:37:43,730
oxicon.
Right?

2122
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:47,960
It was people that got oxycontin's.
They got them easy and cheaply,

2123
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:53,080
and then they cramp down on it when they
found that all these people are 

2124
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:53,120
addicted,
so what did they do?

2125
01:37:53,121 --> 01:37:56,160
Did they fix it?
Then they cure their addiction.

2126
01:37:56,160 --> 01:38:01,160
No.
They made these poor fucking people try 

2127
01:38:01,160 --> 01:38:03,921
to figure out some other way to get 
their fix and the way to do that was 

2128
01:38:03,921 --> 01:38:05,400
heroin a cheaper way to get it?
To get it?

2129
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:07,530
The only way to get it because he 
couldn't get the pills anymore,

2130
01:38:07,890 --> 01:38:10,080
so they started shooting up.
That's where it came from.

2131
01:38:10,081 --> 01:38:15,081
Exactly.
It was all spawned out of the 

2132
01:38:15,081 --> 01:38:15,081
prescription drug problem that we have 
in this country.

2133
01:38:15,081 --> 01:38:16,920
Apparently that movie that those guys 
came in here,

2134
01:38:16,921 --> 01:38:21,921
this prescription thugs.
Apparently it's very good and there's 

2135
01:38:21,921 --> 01:38:25,491
some insane fucking stats,
statistics about it and I'll try to get 

2136
01:38:25,491 --> 01:38:29,560
those guys to come back in and talk 
about it after I'm there.

2137
01:38:29,590 --> 01:38:32,430
They're doing their their press cycle 
right now and after I watch it,

2138
01:38:33,030 --> 01:38:35,220
but a the same guys who did bigger,
stronger,

2139
01:38:35,221 --> 01:38:37,650
faster,
which was supposedly on steroids.

2140
01:38:37,651 --> 01:38:39,930
Did this expose a on prescription drugs?

2141
01:38:39,930 --> 01:38:42,210
Yeah,
Chris Brown and mark his brother,

2142
01:38:43,260 --> 01:38:46,380
but it's terrifying.
Terrifying,

2143
01:38:46,590 --> 01:38:47,560
terrifying.
Oh.

2144
01:38:48,060 --> 01:38:53,060
What's so scary as a parent is that you 
could basically raise this beautiful 

2145
01:38:54,451 --> 01:38:58,740
person their whole life and get to the 
whatever age.

2146
01:38:58,950 --> 01:39:03,950
Let's put them as you know,
17 to 25 when they're out on their own 

2147
01:39:03,950 --> 01:39:04,920
doing their thing.
One bad summer,

2148
01:39:05,580 --> 01:39:08,880
one horrible week,
one intense weekend,

2149
01:39:08,910 --> 01:39:10,110
and you can lose them.
Well,

2150
01:39:10,111 --> 01:39:15,111
how about this?
Someone could fucking give them 

2151
01:39:15,111 --> 01:39:15,111
something and they can die from it.
Someone can lie to them.

2152
01:39:15,111 --> 01:39:20,070
Someone could bill cosby them,
give them some shit that they think is 

2153
01:39:20,070 --> 01:39:20,340
going to whack them out so they can have
sex with your daughter.

2154
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:22,890
Crazy die of an overdose.
That happens.

2155
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:24,900
It's insane.
You can't even.

2156
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:27,300
You can't even have your kids go to a 
party.

2157
01:39:27,390 --> 01:39:28,560
You can eat,
drink.

2158
01:39:28,770 --> 01:39:30,590
You can't have a sour patch kid.
Especially.

2159
01:39:30,780 --> 01:39:31,500
Can't do any.

2160
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:34,110
I know women have to be very careful 
about what they drink.

2161
01:39:34,980 --> 01:39:35,570
You know,
I.

2162
01:39:35,571 --> 01:39:38,130
I know,
I know people who've been drugged.

2163
01:39:38,580 --> 01:39:41,060
I met people who have been drugged this.
It's very common.

2164
01:39:41,070 --> 01:39:43,890
Yeah.
Guys dropped completely.

2165
01:39:44,160 --> 01:39:45,150
Terrifying Shit,
man.

2166
01:39:45,190 --> 01:39:48,030
Terrifying.
This is bill cosby thing is,

2167
01:39:48,450 --> 01:39:51,900
you know,
I think it's awful.

2168
01:39:51,901 --> 01:39:56,901
It's horrific,
but it at least it's opening up this 

2169
01:39:56,901 --> 01:40:00,711
discussion that I think we need to have 
in this country about men who are 

2170
01:40:00,711 --> 01:40:02,040
willing to drug women and have sex than 
weather out.

2171
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:05,190
That is a creepy,
sociopathic,

2172
01:40:05,191 --> 01:40:08,220
psychopathic type of person.
So creepy.

2173
01:40:08,310 --> 01:40:11,700
It's scary.
It's it really empowerful.

2174
01:40:11,701 --> 01:40:15,630
People like him wasn't the other one 
from the singing show.

2175
01:40:15,631 --> 01:40:17,610
He was.
He was given a.

2176
01:40:18,060 --> 01:40:23,060
allegedly wasn't cee lo green busted for
given girls ecstasy just without them 

2177
01:40:23,311 --> 01:40:24,020
knowing.
Yeah.

2178
01:40:24,510 --> 01:40:26,040
Allegedly,
allegedly,

2179
01:40:26,041 --> 01:40:29,100
allegedly who the guy who looks like a 
peanut m and m was trying to get.

2180
01:40:29,370 --> 01:40:30,740
Get some boats.
We had some pressure.

2181
01:40:30,741 --> 01:40:35,280
I couldn't do it any other way.
I met him once they get on a plane,

2182
01:40:35,281 --> 01:40:36,990
I was like,
oh Jesus Christ.

2183
01:40:37,980 --> 01:40:39,210
For sure.
Stop eating dude.

2184
01:40:40,450 --> 01:40:44,790
Settle down gluten grain and everything.
Take bowls stomach.

2185
01:40:44,970 --> 01:40:48,690
He had that one song that fuck you song.
Great Song.

2186
01:40:48,710 --> 01:40:53,710
It was a good song.
And that launched the whole thing is 

2187
01:40:53,710 --> 01:40:53,710
that uh,
since those allegations,

2188
01:40:53,710 --> 01:40:54,610
I think he's kind of disappeared,
right?

2189
01:40:55,030 --> 01:40:56,410
Yeah.
I don't know what the deal is.

2190
01:40:56,411 --> 01:40:58,960
I mean he might be in the middle of a 
trial or something.

2191
01:40:58,990 --> 01:41:00,970
I mean,
just to knock them out.

2192
01:41:02,190 --> 01:41:03,730
We'll access.
He doesn't knock them out,

2193
01:41:03,731 --> 01:41:05,830
but I think it makes them much more 
willing to have sex.

2194
01:41:06,220 --> 01:41:08,020
But back to the cosby thing,
like what you're saying,

2195
01:41:08,021 --> 01:41:12,000
like that issue of guys that are just 
willing to knock women out.

2196
01:41:13,020 --> 01:41:18,020
Oh,
why do you feel good about yourself the 

2197
01:41:18,020 --> 01:41:18,020
next.

2198
01:41:18,020 --> 01:41:18,020
As soon as it's over,
it's not about that.

2199
01:41:18,020 --> 01:41:19,420
It's about getting back at women,
I think.

2200
01:41:19,450 --> 01:41:20,350
Is it?
Yeah.

2201
01:41:20,351 --> 01:41:25,351
I think there's women out there that 
hate men and there's men out there that 

2202
01:41:26,381 --> 01:41:28,450
hate women.
I think at this point it's ridiculous to

2203
01:41:28,690 --> 01:41:33,690
pretend anything different and I think 
there's a direct correlation between 

2204
01:41:33,690 --> 01:41:38,010
people that have been rejected and 
people that have associated women with 

2205
01:41:38,010 --> 01:41:39,850
someone who's going to turn them down or
treat them like shit because they're not

2206
01:41:39,851 --> 01:41:41,100
physically attractive.
Right.

2207
01:41:41,160 --> 01:41:43,060
This fucking guy is built like a peanut 
m and m's.

2208
01:41:43,090 --> 01:41:44,140
Right.
You know,

2209
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:49,720
you know,
I was lucky enough where I never had 

2210
01:41:49,720 --> 01:41:51,520
those interactions with girls coming up 
with funny.

2211
01:41:51,870 --> 01:41:54,020
It was funny and pretty good looking.
Well,

2212
01:41:54,021 --> 01:41:59,021
you know,
but a meeting friends as an adult who 

2213
01:42:00,590 --> 01:42:03,910
women just screwed them over in their 
mind,

2214
01:42:03,980 --> 01:42:05,930
in their,
in their fable.

2215
01:42:07,250 --> 01:42:10,250
They come out with a whole different 
view of womanhood.

2216
01:42:10,450 --> 01:42:11,040
Yeah.
I mean,

2217
01:42:11,060 --> 01:42:16,060
mine was really pleasant and I always 
see women as the victim or I always see 

2218
01:42:16,060 --> 01:42:19,931
women and the guys who had a really 
shitty time and they got jumped on and 

2219
01:42:19,931 --> 01:42:24,461
whatever.
There's a rage that these guys carry 

2220
01:42:24,461 --> 01:42:27,731
around that it's really just kind of 
like a stroke of luck that when I was 

2221
01:42:27,731 --> 01:42:28,070
young I met them.
Nice ones.

2222
01:42:28,160 --> 01:42:29,290
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

2223
01:42:29,550 --> 01:42:31,460
These guys are really like,
you know,

2224
01:42:31,461 --> 01:42:35,120
you see guys like and they kind of say 
jokes about like knocking a girl out and

2225
01:42:35,121 --> 01:42:36,800
doing all those kinds of events.
It's not really.

2226
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:39,760
They're not really kidding in a way.
Yeah.

2227
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:44,800
You know what I mean?
It's a darkness anytime you talk about 

2228
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:44,800
women,
right?

2229
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:44,800
These guys,
well,

2230
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:49,300
there's always going to be people that 
got fucked over by somebody and if 

2231
01:42:49,300 --> 01:42:53,491
you're involved in a horrific divorce,
and I have a friend who was involved in 

2232
01:42:53,491 --> 01:42:57,671
a horrific divorce that took years and 
I've talked about on this podcast ad 

2233
01:42:57,671 --> 01:42:59,200
nauseum.
Unfortunately he's,

2234
01:42:59,201 --> 01:43:04,201
he's got to pay her for the rest of his 
life because you were married for 12 

2235
01:43:04,201 --> 01:43:04,201
years,
so he,

2236
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:09,560
she's a grown woman.
If you have a fucking kid when the kids 

2237
01:43:09,560 --> 01:43:09,560
18,
they're on their own.

2238
01:43:09,560 --> 01:43:09,560
Yeah,
but not.

2239
01:43:09,560 --> 01:43:14,340
Not a woman.
Like if you have a woman and you're 

2240
01:43:14,340 --> 01:43:14,340
married to her for 12 years,
by the way,

2241
01:43:14,340 --> 01:43:14,590
they were divorced more than 12 years 
ago,

2242
01:43:14,680 --> 01:43:17,590
so he has to pay her forever,
forever,

2243
01:43:17,680 --> 01:43:18,940
forever,
until she died.

2244
01:43:18,970 --> 01:43:23,970
So she fucking die.
So if she gets into some life extension 

2245
01:43:23,970 --> 01:43:23,970
shit,
some new science comes out.

2246
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:26,950
He and he lives for 500 years and she 
lives for 500 years.

2247
01:43:27,130 --> 01:43:32,130
He's going to have to pay her for some 
shit that he doesn't even remember 

2248
01:43:32,130 --> 01:43:32,130
anymore.
Oh my God.

2249
01:43:32,130 --> 01:43:32,950
And I'm not talking about a small amount
of money either.

2250
01:43:32,951 --> 01:43:35,500
He's wealthy,
so he's paying her hundreds of thousands

2251
01:43:35,501 --> 01:43:36,940
of dollars a year.
More than a half a million.

2252
01:43:36,941 --> 01:43:38,530
I think.
So it's his rage like,

2253
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:39,640
oh,
that's crazy.

2254
01:43:39,910 --> 01:43:41,530
If you get them started up,
he just needed.

2255
01:43:41,531 --> 01:43:46,531
He literally needs a drink really start 
bubbling in his mind because the whole 

2256
01:43:46,841 --> 01:43:48,430
thing was a fuck.
California.

2257
01:43:48,490 --> 01:43:49,690
Yeah.
Yeah.

2258
01:43:49,691 --> 01:43:54,691
There's bad divorce laws and there's 
really bad horrible ones and if you get 

2259
01:43:54,691 --> 01:43:55,670
the wrong lawyer and she gets the right 
one.

2260
01:43:55,800 --> 01:44:00,800
Oh God.
It's just insane that you don't have to 

2261
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:07,000
move on with your life like as a woman,
but a woman is married to a guy and 

2262
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:11,081
we're not talking about someone with 
children and she doesn't even have any 

2263
01:44:11,081 --> 01:44:11,081
children.
Right?

2264
01:44:11,081 --> 01:44:12,440
Like there's,
this is indefensible because people said

2265
01:44:12,441 --> 01:44:14,030
no children.
I've heard people say,

2266
01:44:14,031 --> 01:44:14,950
yeah,
but you know,

2267
01:44:15,020 --> 01:44:20,020
she's got to raise the kids.
What kids know kids and when you tell 

2268
01:44:20,020 --> 01:44:20,020
them that they go,
wait,

2269
01:44:20,020 --> 01:44:23,561
what?
Actually she doesn't even have any kids 

2270
01:44:23,561 --> 01:44:26,621
and he has to pay her for ever forever 
millions and millions and millions of 

2271
01:44:27,770 --> 01:44:30,380
dollars by the time she's dead for 
nothing,

2272
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:31,480
for nothing.
Forgot.

2273
01:44:31,530 --> 01:44:34,370
They had a relationship relationship 
with time together and he didn't want to

2274
01:44:34,371 --> 01:44:37,130
be with her anymore,
so he has to pay her forever.

2275
01:44:37,660 --> 01:44:42,660
Oh,
it's the most horrific form of 

2276
01:44:42,660 --> 01:44:42,840
prostitution known to man.
Oh my God.

2277
01:44:43,490 --> 01:44:45,770
It's crazy.
It's crazy.

2278
01:44:46,370 --> 01:44:49,230
We're not talking about child support.
That's insane.

2279
01:44:49,231 --> 01:44:54,231
Now we're not talking even about a woman
who like put the guy through school 

2280
01:44:54,231 --> 01:44:55,880
while he was working on his engineering 
degree or something like that.

2281
01:44:55,881 --> 01:44:59,240
And then he went on to become successful
and tried to abandon her and she's like,

2282
01:44:59,241 --> 01:45:00,500
Hey,
I put you through school.

2283
01:45:00,740 --> 01:45:02,300
I'm responsible for part of your 
success.

2284
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:03,560
That makes a lot of sense.
Yeah.

2285
01:45:03,561 --> 01:45:04,640
Nope.
Never worked.

2286
01:45:04,850 --> 01:45:06,170
Never.
Never.

2287
01:45:06,260 --> 01:45:09,390
Never worked while she was with him.
Never worked.

2288
01:45:10,470 --> 01:45:12,440
Yeah,
don't worry,

2289
01:45:12,441 --> 01:45:13,310
baby.
I'll take care of you.

2290
01:45:13,311 --> 01:45:15,440
You don't have to work.
How does the law support that?

2291
01:45:15,470 --> 01:45:19,340
Because they're cunts.
Cunt festival up there.

2292
01:45:19,680 --> 01:45:21,200
Oh,
whoever creates it.

2293
01:45:21,201 --> 01:45:23,420
Whoever forces it.
Whoever looks at that on paper and says,

2294
01:45:23,421 --> 01:45:24,650
that's good.
That's how it's written.

2295
01:45:24,980 --> 01:45:29,980
You should.
A media should come from God's hand and 

2296
01:45:29,980 --> 01:45:30,710
fucking blow your brains out.
It's insane.

2297
01:45:30,740 --> 01:45:33,410
That is crazy town.
It's so gross.

2298
01:45:33,530 --> 01:45:35,540
That is scary.
It's scary.

2299
01:45:35,780 --> 01:45:38,660
It's really scary.
What if he just got a job as a busboy?

2300
01:45:38,780 --> 01:45:43,780
Well,
he's response and went to like a studio 

2301
01:45:43,780 --> 01:45:43,780
apartment and didn't make that much 
money anymore.

2302
01:45:43,780 --> 01:45:44,150
Well,
I've got another one,

2303
01:45:44,660 --> 01:45:45,170
Dave.

2304
01:45:47,550 --> 01:45:48,360
Cool.
Yay.

2305
01:45:48,460 --> 01:45:51,670
No,
God damn it from a news.

2306
01:45:51,740 --> 01:45:52,750
Newsradio.
Jesus Christ.

2307
01:45:52,820 --> 01:45:55,790
Dave,
want to draw a blank on date because,

2308
01:45:55,810 --> 01:45:58,190
uh,
this one hurts my brain so much.

2309
01:45:58,210 --> 01:45:59,800
I draw blanks.
Now.

2310
01:45:59,810 --> 01:46:04,810
Dave Foley got divorced and his wife 
wanted money.

2311
01:46:05,780 --> 01:46:10,780
That is like the way they establish how 
much money he was going to pair was 

2312
01:46:10,881 --> 01:46:13,250
depending upon how much money he was 
making at the time.

2313
01:46:13,390 --> 01:46:15,350
So he was on news radio when they got 
divorced,

2314
01:46:15,590 --> 01:46:20,590
so that was the highlight of his entire 
life as far as how much money he's ever 

2315
01:46:20,590 --> 01:46:20,590
going to make in a month.
Right.

2316
01:46:20,780 --> 01:46:22,880
So they based it on a percentage of 
that,

2317
01:46:22,900 --> 01:46:26,540
like 50 percent of that,
which he will never.

2318
01:46:26,600 --> 01:46:28,220
I mean right now he's never made.
I mean,

2319
01:46:28,221 --> 01:46:29,690
I don't know if he will.
Maybe he will.

2320
01:46:29,691 --> 01:46:32,870
He's a very talented guy.
He might have a hit next week,

2321
01:46:33,350 --> 01:46:38,350
but as far as right now,
it's never made that kind of money ever 

2322
01:46:38,350 --> 01:46:41,141
again in his life.
So He owes hundreds of thousands of 

2323
01:46:41,141 --> 01:46:41,141
dollars.
Can't go to Canada.

2324
01:46:41,141 --> 01:46:42,940
If he goes to Canada,
they'll arrest him and the DA.

2325
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:48,000
The judge literally said to him,
your ability to pay has no relation to 

2326
01:46:48,051 --> 01:46:49,410
your obligation to pay.

2327
01:46:51,750 --> 01:46:56,220
So you have an obligation to obey.
I do not care if you're able to able to,

2328
01:46:56,221 --> 01:46:58,410
you have an obligation to make more 
money.

2329
01:46:58,980 --> 01:47:01,500
Oh my God.
But in the end,

2330
01:47:01,501 --> 01:47:06,290
and that's the judge's words to his face
and it's not like,

2331
01:47:07,050 --> 01:47:08,850
you know,
even $100,000

2332
01:47:08,851 --> 01:47:11,700
working at straight gig.
That's like winning the lottery.

2333
01:47:11,701 --> 01:47:13,710
Yeah.
They based it on his winning ticket.

2334
01:47:14,190 --> 01:47:17,000
He won the lottery based network show.
Yeah,

2335
01:47:17,010 --> 01:47:19,950
he won.
He got the cushiest spot ever,

2336
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:22,740
which is a network Sitcom in the 
nineties,

2337
01:47:22,770 --> 01:47:25,560
right back when they were real.
It's not a,

2338
01:47:25,620 --> 01:47:27,620
you cannot,
they don't even exist anymore.

2339
01:47:28,020 --> 01:47:29,550
That.
How many sitcoms are there now?

2340
01:47:29,551 --> 01:47:34,551
They're 10 million actors in Hollywood 
trying to get on 10 sit.

2341
01:47:34,740 --> 01:47:37,170
Right?
Oh.

2342
01:47:37,420 --> 01:47:42,420
Oh.
And he's 50 something so it's not going 

2343
01:47:42,420 --> 01:47:42,420
to happen.
I mean,

2344
01:47:42,420 --> 01:47:46,730
they don't want the 57 guy.
They want the guy that he was in the 

2345
01:47:46,730 --> 01:47:46,730
nineties,
they want the 30 year old guy.

2346
01:47:46,730 --> 01:47:48,390
Oh my God.
What a nightmare.

2347
01:47:48,391 --> 01:47:50,580
Fucking Christ.
And He's another one.

2348
01:47:50,790 --> 01:47:53,190
You're around him when he talks about it
and you just need a drink.

2349
01:47:53,530 --> 01:47:54,760
I can drink.
You start small.

2350
01:47:54,840 --> 01:47:56,330
It's so sad.
Ice Cubes,

2351
01:47:56,600 --> 01:47:59,400
dance classes and whiskey starts pouring
and you're like,

2352
01:47:59,401 --> 01:48:02,820
fuck.
And he is the nicest guy.

2353
01:48:02,821 --> 01:48:07,821
Yeah,
he is one of the handful of nicest 

2354
01:48:07,821 --> 01:48:09,290
people I've ever met in my life and he 
talks about his ex wife goes,

2355
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:13,200
she's a contact.
She is and she will not negotiate.

2356
01:48:13,230 --> 01:48:15,750
She will not lessen his money.
She will not.

2357
01:48:15,751 --> 01:48:17,550
She doesn't give a fuck.
She wants to torture him.

2358
01:48:17,790 --> 01:48:20,670
She's as crazy as that crazy person.
Oh,

2359
01:48:20,750 --> 01:48:23,370
it's so gross.
But that's these crazy laws.

2360
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:24,270
And when people say,
well,

2361
01:48:24,271 --> 01:48:26,850
why do you think why?
Like even my own wife,

2362
01:48:26,851 --> 01:48:29,400
like I say,
the Saint Mary's is retarded.

2363
01:48:29,401 --> 01:48:31,290
It's ridiculous.
I am happy.

2364
01:48:31,350 --> 01:48:32,130
I'm happily married.

2365
01:48:32,460 --> 01:48:33,450
I love her.
She's great.

2366
01:48:33,451 --> 01:48:36,300
I love having a family.
It is fucking dumb.

2367
01:48:36,530 --> 01:48:37,500
Well,
you shouldn't say that.

2368
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:41,400
That's fucking dumb.
I shouldn't say it.

2369
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,510
If you were making all the money you'd 
say to,

2370
01:48:43,550 --> 01:48:45,510
it's great to see.
He took.

2371
01:48:45,690 --> 01:48:49,890
It's a legal contract with the state 
that involves two people getting along.

2372
01:48:50,020 --> 01:48:55,020
That's insane.
It's one of the most transient things 

2373
01:48:55,020 --> 01:48:57,240
that we can do is try to establish 
sexual relationships with each other.

2374
01:48:57,700 --> 01:48:59,490
Often those fucking things.
Last,

2375
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:02,100
none of them lasts forever.
Well,

2376
01:49:02,101 --> 01:49:04,020
it's really,
it's really a business.

2377
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:08,340
You're really creating a business and it
becomes a big business as you go further

2378
01:49:08,341 --> 01:49:11,250
on and bring on other employees and 
children in that kind of thing,

2379
01:49:12,300 --> 01:49:17,300
and this is why you're not allowed to 
have sex with your coworkers because 

2380
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:19,220
that makes things very complicated,
right?

2381
01:49:19,221 --> 01:49:19,810
Yeah.
If you.

2382
01:49:19,830 --> 01:49:24,830
If you have a job and you have a 
secretary and you start banging your 

2383
01:49:24,830 --> 01:49:27,831
secretary and she's a part of this 
business that you've created with your 

2384
01:49:27,831 --> 01:49:27,831
wife,
you got real issues,

2385
01:49:27,831 --> 01:49:29,850
you're experiencing pleasure from 
someone else and that's like,

2386
01:49:29,851 --> 01:49:31,590
you know,
like if you are working on a set,

2387
01:49:31,650 --> 01:49:34,470
you can't plug something in because it 
was a union electrician,

2388
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:34,920
right?

2389
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:36,040
It's his job,
right?

2390
01:49:36,240 --> 01:49:41,240
You need that union electrician.
Otherwise that guy wouldn't really be 

2391
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:41,240
able to justify his position.
Well,

2392
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:44,400
your,
your wife is your Dick Technician and if

2393
01:49:44,660 --> 01:49:49,660
your secondary,
not only does she handle your paperwork 

2394
01:49:49,660 --> 01:49:49,660
but also handles your Dick.
Well,

2395
01:49:49,660 --> 01:49:52,630
we've got a problem here because we have
one too many employees.

2396
01:49:52,631 --> 01:49:53,900
It's very complicated.
Well,

2397
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:55,960
this try and keep that on the rails.
Yeah.

2398
01:49:55,961 --> 01:49:58,870
The secretary is really good at plugging
things in and um,

2399
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:01,630
I just feel like I don't need someone 
else.

2400
01:50:01,870 --> 01:50:05,380
So it's all a bitch.
The kids are 18 fuck off.

2401
01:50:05,450 --> 01:50:06,870
Was going to be a big lawsuit.
Well yeah.

2402
01:50:06,871 --> 01:50:11,871
Madeline Albright on speed dial eight.
Or is it where you got divorced?

2403
01:50:16,200 --> 01:50:19,690
I think where you got married as big,
it's the bigger part is a big one.

2404
01:50:20,180 --> 01:50:22,900
If you get married in California,
that's like one of the worst places.

2405
01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:23,830
One of my.
Yeah,

2406
01:50:23,831 --> 01:50:28,831
it's one of the worst places.
One of my favorite stories was this New 

2407
01:50:28,831 --> 01:50:29,830
York.
I'm really wealthy.

2408
01:50:30,190 --> 01:50:35,190
Fucking millionaire,
multimillionaire business guy marries 

2409
01:50:35,190 --> 01:50:36,220
this young lady.
He's in his sixties.

2410
01:50:36,250 --> 01:50:38,020
She's in her 30 [inaudible].
She's hot as fuck.

2411
01:50:38,021 --> 01:50:40,690
He marries her and then when he marries 
her,

2412
01:50:41,410 --> 01:50:45,280
he immediately files for divorce in the 
Dominican Republic,

2413
01:50:46,370 --> 01:50:51,370
believe is Dominican Republic.
Write this story up because it was real 

2414
01:50:51,370 --> 01:50:53,791
recent.
She had no idea they were married the 

2415
01:50:53,791 --> 01:50:53,791
entire time.
She thought they were married,

2416
01:50:53,791 --> 01:50:57,750
but he had filed for divorce and had 
attorneys represent her and him in 

2417
01:50:58,961 --> 01:51:03,590
absentia.
He paid for both lawyers on the case and

2418
01:51:03,610 --> 01:51:06,430
got divorced.
So he didn't have any country in another

2419
01:51:06,431 --> 01:51:08,590
country,
so he's saying we're not married.

2420
01:51:08,980 --> 01:51:12,610
Bitch got divorced weeks afterwards.
Here's my paperwork.

2421
01:51:12,690 --> 01:51:16,060
It's binding in the Dominican Republic.
This is a legal document.

2422
01:51:16,180 --> 01:51:17,710
Really?
Where'd they get married?

2423
01:51:18,640 --> 01:51:19,390
In the station?

2424
01:51:19,660 --> 01:51:20,140
Yeah,
I think so.

2425
01:51:20,141 --> 01:51:21,820
In the states.
She's.

2426
01:51:21,850 --> 01:51:22,690
Yeah.
Mick Jagger.

2427
01:51:22,691 --> 01:51:24,160
Try to do the same thing with Jerry 
Hall.

2428
01:51:24,250 --> 01:51:25,230
Oh really?
He's like,

2429
01:51:25,240 --> 01:51:26,070
bitch,
we didn't even get married.

2430
01:51:26,090 --> 01:51:28,810
America.
We got married on like a fucking coconut

2431
01:51:28,811 --> 01:51:33,811
island somewhere.
So he was saying that that didn't count 

2432
01:51:33,811 --> 01:51:35,100
either.
Oh my guy.

2433
01:51:35,140 --> 01:51:36,010
Yeah.
Here's the guy.

2434
01:51:36,190 --> 01:51:41,190
Husbands secretly divorced wife after 
wedding to protect his assets and look 

2435
01:51:41,190 --> 01:51:43,270
at him and look at her.
She's hot and young.

2436
01:51:43,271 --> 01:51:45,790
Of course they were married for 20 
years.

2437
01:51:45,791 --> 01:51:50,320
Raising a son and living the good life 
in between homes in New York and France.

2438
01:51:50,370 --> 01:51:52,780
I'm like,
it was all perfect except one thing.

2439
01:51:52,870 --> 01:51:57,870
He had secretly divorced her just months
after their wedding in an apparent 

2440
01:51:57,870 --> 01:52:01,540
attempt to shield his assets.
He's 90.

2441
01:52:01,570 --> 01:52:03,820
Yeah.
And now she's 59.

2442
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:09,000
She's suing her in a 90 year old husband
to nullify the divorce that she never 

2443
01:52:10,001 --> 01:52:15,001
knew about.
And keep him from selling an apartment 

2444
01:52:15,001 --> 01:52:17,641
that they shared that they met in 1994.
So they met when he was 70.

2445
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:23,230
He knew what was going on.
Yeah,

2446
01:52:23,290 --> 01:52:26,110
he was 70 and probably shouldn't no to 
the prenup.

2447
01:52:26,290 --> 01:52:29,310
And she was more than 30 years.
Uh,

2448
01:52:29,620 --> 01:52:31,820
his senior.
Huh?

2449
01:52:32,300 --> 01:52:37,000
She was like somewhere around 30 
something years old as fuck.

2450
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:40,330
Marrying a 70 year old guy.
She says it's a fraud.

2451
01:52:40,331 --> 01:52:41,390
She tells the post,
well,

2452
01:52:42,120 --> 01:52:46,000
well it's the fraud.
Now what?

2453
01:52:46,170 --> 01:52:48,420
What did you do to get that apart?
Where's,

2454
01:52:48,500 --> 01:52:50,090
where's your money coming from,
lady?

2455
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:52,580
How's that work?
But it's not good enough.

2456
01:52:52,581 --> 01:52:57,581
See,
we've established that when someone 

2457
01:52:57,581 --> 01:52:57,581
marries someone,
they won the lottery.

2458
01:52:57,581 --> 01:52:59,600
When you marry some old rich dude like 
that guy,

2459
01:52:59,810 --> 01:53:04,810
you've won the lottery and then you 
deserve to get paid from winning that 

2460
01:53:04,810 --> 01:53:05,510
lottery.
But the reality is what?

2461
01:53:05,511 --> 01:53:10,511
What,
what exactly was going on in that 

2462
01:53:10,511 --> 01:53:12,431
relationship?
They were together and he made all the 

2463
01:53:12,431 --> 01:53:14,480
money and she wants some of that money 
that he made while she was living in the

2464
01:53:14,481 --> 01:53:16,430
same place as him.
And that's really what it is.

2465
01:53:17,030 --> 01:53:20,000
If you're an athlete,
a professional athlete,

2466
01:53:20,001 --> 01:53:21,980
how do you possibly meet someone and 
think,

2467
01:53:21,981 --> 01:53:24,260
this is gonna,
go against you.

2468
01:53:24,650 --> 01:53:25,730
Well,
sometimes it works.

2469
01:53:25,820 --> 01:53:27,830
Sometimes you can meet the right people,
man.

2470
01:53:28,010 --> 01:53:29,450
It's just.
It's really who are you?

2471
01:53:29,480 --> 01:53:30,230
Who are they?

2472
01:53:30,340 --> 01:53:35,340
It's so hard to generalize and some 
relationships work great and some 

2473
01:53:35,340 --> 01:53:39,281
marriages worth grade some marriages 
where both people make a similar amount 

2474
01:53:39,281 --> 01:53:41,810
of money and then no one is really in it
for the money and they had just their.

2475
01:53:41,850 --> 01:53:46,850
They have a modest living and they enjoy
themselves and they just love being 

2476
01:53:46,850 --> 01:53:48,350
together and they liked the fact that 
they were a ring and hey,

2477
01:53:48,351 --> 01:53:50,060
that's my wife.
That's my husband.

2478
01:53:50,360 --> 01:53:51,530
We're happy.
We love it.

2479
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:54,110
This is great.
That's nothing wrong with that.

2480
01:53:54,260 --> 01:53:59,260
The real problem is when you break up 
like my buddy who went through this 

2481
01:53:59,260 --> 01:53:59,540
horrific,
horrific divorce,

2482
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:05,560
he married a new woman after that and 
she didn't want to sign a prenup and he 

2483
01:54:05,560 --> 01:54:06,700
was going fucking crazy.
You know,

2484
01:54:06,860 --> 01:54:08,870
and,
and everyone was screaming at him,

2485
01:54:08,871 --> 01:54:12,210
all of his friends do not do this.
You have to find it.

2486
01:54:12,950 --> 01:54:17,950
She's like,
you're saying that it's not going to 

2487
01:54:17,950 --> 01:54:17,950
work.

2488
01:54:17,950 --> 01:54:17,950
He's like,
no,

2489
01:54:17,950 --> 01:54:21,280
because if it doesn't work then the 
prenup doesn't mean anything and he has 

2490
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:21,920
a history of always saying,
if it doesn't work,

2491
01:54:21,921 --> 01:54:24,140
the Prenup is valuable.
It comes in handy,

2492
01:54:24,141 --> 01:54:27,470
but if it does,
like what I'm saying is if this marriage

2493
01:54:27,471 --> 01:54:28,580
works,
if you do your part,

2494
01:54:28,581 --> 01:54:29,720
I do my part.
We'll work it out.

2495
01:54:29,721 --> 01:54:31,640
We make it beautiful.
We stayed together forever.

2496
01:54:31,850 --> 01:54:34,820
The prenup doesn't mean shit because 
every time you together forever,

2497
01:54:34,840 --> 01:54:36,770
right?
So if the marriage is going to work,

2498
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:37,790
the problem,
it only,

2499
01:54:37,820 --> 01:54:40,760
it only means something if it doesn't 
work out.

2500
01:54:40,850 --> 01:54:42,680
If you're looking at it as an 
investment.

2501
01:54:42,770 --> 01:54:46,880
So what she is hoping for or what she's 
saying essentially is if it doesn't work

2502
01:54:46,881 --> 01:54:49,820
out,
I want you to get fucked over and you're

2503
01:54:49,821 --> 01:54:54,821
protecting yourself.
You're protecting yourself from the 

2504
01:54:54,821 --> 01:54:54,821
legal system that's set up the fuck you.

2505
01:54:55,420 --> 01:54:58,070
If you and I don't want to be together 
anymore,

2506
01:54:58,430 --> 01:55:03,430
you have to get punished.
You must be punished financially and he 

2507
01:55:03,430 --> 01:55:04,010
has a whole story that he could hold up 
in front of her.

2508
01:55:04,090 --> 01:55:04,790
Like,
you know,

2509
01:55:04,791 --> 01:55:06,950
I am suffering.
Any works like,

2510
01:55:07,270 --> 01:55:08,390
so what do you do?
Hours?

2511
01:55:08,630 --> 01:55:10,910
He's got a prenup.
He does know he got through it.

2512
01:55:10,911 --> 01:55:11,480
Yeah,
he was good.

2513
01:55:11,600 --> 01:55:14,780
He wouldn't do it.
He could you the beating that he took,

2514
01:55:15,510 --> 01:55:17,270
but he lost a house.
He lost.

2515
01:55:17,300 --> 01:55:19,070
I mean it's.
The whole story is comical.

2516
01:55:19,420 --> 01:55:23,450
The ex wife lives in with a guy now,
but she's not allowed to.

2517
01:55:23,451 --> 01:55:27,320
So when they go to inspect the house,
the guy literally puts all this stuff in

2518
01:55:27,321 --> 01:55:32,321
a u haul drives around the corner,
which did inspect her leave and drives 

2519
01:55:32,321 --> 01:55:32,321
back.
It's a game.

2520
01:55:32,321 --> 01:55:35,240
Can you get a private investigators?
Doesn't matter.

2521
01:55:35,241 --> 01:55:36,050
You have to prove it.

2522
01:55:36,120 --> 01:55:37,740
The private investigator.
What?

2523
01:55:38,120 --> 01:55:40,520
What evidence did he discovers?
Like you can't.

2524
01:55:41,180 --> 01:55:43,680
There's only so much privacy.
You can violate someone's home.

2525
01:55:43,820 --> 01:55:48,820
It's not his home.
His own home where he could put in his 

2526
01:55:48,820 --> 01:55:51,540
own home and catch his wife bag and some
fucking personal trainer.

2527
01:55:51,690 --> 01:55:54,270
This is not that.
This is her house now,

2528
01:55:54,870 --> 01:55:59,870
by the way,
multimillion dollar house in the 

2529
01:55:59,870 --> 01:56:00,810
palisades really overlooking the ocean.
All hers.

2530
01:56:01,080 --> 01:56:03,150
Oh God.
Ow.

2531
01:56:03,151 --> 01:56:08,151
It hurts.
When you find out what happened to you 

2532
01:56:08,151 --> 01:56:08,370
in a divorce.
It's horrific,

2533
01:56:08,430 --> 01:56:13,430
but what happens if he seriously gets a 
job working at a diner and it's like no 

2534
01:56:13,801 --> 01:56:15,120
one knows.
No one will hire me.

2535
01:56:15,210 --> 01:56:20,210
He would have to go back to court and 
we'd would have to figure out a way to 

2536
01:56:20,210 --> 01:56:23,601
get a judge to agree to lower the terms.
But the problem is he's responsible for 

2537
01:56:23,601 --> 01:56:24,570
maintaining her lifestyle.

2538
01:56:25,200 --> 01:56:28,440
So if he takes that job,
he could actually be put in prison.

2539
01:56:28,500 --> 01:56:29,940
Yes,
because he's not making enough.

2540
01:56:29,970 --> 01:56:31,410
Exactly.
Well,

2541
01:56:31,411 --> 01:56:34,110
he would have to get a judge that agrees
to maintain,

2542
01:56:34,140 --> 01:56:38,790
to lower the lifestyle that he has been,
that he's obligated to maintain.

2543
01:56:38,970 --> 01:56:41,370
He's obligated to maintain a certain 
lifestyle for her.

2544
01:56:42,780 --> 01:56:44,260
Oh my God.
It's insane.

2545
01:56:44,790 --> 01:56:48,870
We're not talking about substantially.
We're not talking about subsistence.

2546
01:56:49,050 --> 01:56:52,410
We're not talking about like you have to
extrapolate to give her $50,000

2547
01:56:52,411 --> 01:56:54,300
a year and that's enough for her to 
survive on.

2548
01:56:54,301 --> 01:56:59,301
And she wasn't that way.
She doesn't have to get a job or maybe 

2549
01:56:59,301 --> 01:57:02,331
you have to give her a $100,000
for two years until she can figure out 

2550
01:57:02,331 --> 01:57:03,900
how to get a job like that.
She's a human being.

2551
01:57:03,901 --> 01:57:05,670
She's a person.
She's intelligent,

2552
01:57:05,700 --> 01:57:07,500
she's articulate,
she has an education.

2553
01:57:07,980 --> 01:57:12,180
She's not a handicap person.
She's not diseased like she's not broken

2554
01:57:12,270 --> 01:57:13,290
like where she can't work.

2555
01:57:13,320 --> 01:57:16,620
She doesn't have feet.
She's like a regular person,

2556
01:57:17,110 --> 01:57:20,040
a regular person.
It's fucking madness.

2557
01:57:20,041 --> 01:57:23,070
Wow.
I made it is mostly madness.

2558
01:57:23,100 --> 01:57:25,710
It's really the worst case scenario.
The thing is in,

2559
01:57:25,711 --> 01:57:30,711
unless you're with these people,
you don't know these stories unless you 

2560
01:57:30,711 --> 01:57:32,160
know someone that's gone through this,
you don't know these stories,

2561
01:57:32,580 --> 01:57:37,580
and then when you hear these men's 
rights groups and then you hear 

2562
01:57:37,580 --> 01:57:37,960
feminists mock men's rights groups like 
this is.

2563
01:57:38,250 --> 01:57:43,250
This is the reason why a lot of people 
won't take feminism seriously and this 

2564
01:57:43,250 --> 01:57:46,640
because a lot of them mock these men's 
rights groups and this is also the 

2565
01:57:46,640 --> 01:57:49,761
reason why a lot of these men's rights 
groups have a valid point because 

2566
01:57:49,761 --> 01:57:51,690
there's a lot of men's rights points 
that are stupid as far.

2567
01:57:52,020 --> 01:57:53,850
What do you care if these feminists 
don't like you?

2568
01:57:53,851 --> 01:57:58,851
What do you care?
They bitch about the way you act or 

2569
01:57:58,851 --> 01:57:58,851
dress unless you work with them.

2570
01:57:58,851 --> 01:57:58,851
What do you care?
Right?

2571
01:57:58,851 --> 01:57:58,980
You know,
if you're.

2572
01:57:58,981 --> 01:58:03,981
If you're trapped in some office with 
some man hating woman and she has a 

2573
01:58:03,981 --> 01:58:06,030
position above you and she's making your
life hell well,

2574
01:58:06,060 --> 01:58:09,330
that's no different than being trapped 
in an office with some sexist pig.

2575
01:58:09,331 --> 01:58:10,890
Man.
If you're a woman,

2576
01:58:10,910 --> 01:58:12,000
it's.
It's terrible.

2577
01:58:12,060 --> 01:58:14,790
If someone is gender specifically biased
in any way,

2578
01:58:14,791 --> 01:58:16,950
shape or sure,
but in,

2579
01:58:17,070 --> 01:58:19,380
unless you see the devastation that it 
can,

2580
01:58:20,090 --> 01:58:25,050
it someone's life like day Foley's life.
From the time that I met him,

2581
01:58:25,260 --> 01:58:28,170
to the time that he got divorced when he
was on Newsradio,

2582
01:58:28,380 --> 01:58:33,150
his life has been overwhelmingly 
influenced by this woman that he used to

2583
01:58:33,151 --> 01:58:35,610
be married to,
that he doesn't even know anymore.

2584
01:58:35,720 --> 01:58:36,390
Yeah.
I mean,

2585
01:58:36,420 --> 01:58:38,550
he doesn't see her anymore.
He hasn't.

2586
01:58:38,610 --> 01:58:43,610
He hasn't had sex with her in decades,
but they're still inexorably connected 

2587
01:58:44,231 --> 01:58:46,270
financially and it has ruined his life.

2588
01:58:46,780 --> 01:58:51,780
These are two pages to people I know who
have to pay the women that they used to 

2589
01:58:52,721 --> 01:58:55,900
sleep with more than 20 years ago.
He has to.

2590
01:58:55,960 --> 01:58:58,300
They have to pay them forever.
Oh my God.

2591
01:58:59,050 --> 01:59:01,000
And that's just one story.
And the,

2592
01:59:01,240 --> 01:59:04,330
the problem is the court system,
and this is one of the things that I was

2593
01:59:04,331 --> 01:59:07,040
going over with Phil Hartman before his 
wife murdered him.

2594
01:59:07,630 --> 01:59:08,950
I was telling him,
you know,

2595
01:59:08,951 --> 01:59:09,600
I'm,
I,

2596
01:59:10,210 --> 01:59:15,210
I grew up in a really fucked up house.
Like when I was little,

2597
01:59:15,260 --> 01:59:20,260
my parents split up when I was young 
there was violence and there was just 

2598
01:59:20,260 --> 01:59:20,260
like,
and my mom,

2599
01:59:20,260 --> 01:59:24,960
when my dad hit my mom,
my mom got her shit and got the fuck 

2600
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:25,570
out.
I saw it.

2601
01:59:25,630 --> 01:59:28,660
I saw him hit her eye and then we moved 
to my grandpa's,

2602
01:59:28,790 --> 01:59:33,790
my grandfather's house.
Like immediately afterwards we were out 

2603
01:59:33,790 --> 01:59:35,040
and apparently he had done it before and
you know,

2604
01:59:35,041 --> 01:59:36,940
he terrorized her and she was just like,
fuck this.

2605
01:59:37,480 --> 01:59:39,670
We're gone.
So my,

2606
01:59:39,700 --> 01:59:43,090
in my mind when Shit goes bad,
you've got to fucking pull strings,

2607
01:59:43,480 --> 01:59:45,520
get you just get out,
just get out.

2608
01:59:45,550 --> 01:59:46,690
So I was telling Phil,
I go,

2609
01:59:46,691 --> 01:59:48,190
dude,
get out of there man.

2610
01:59:48,191 --> 01:59:49,990
Just get out.
It was like.

2611
01:59:50,080 --> 01:59:51,730
He was like,
it's not that simple.

2612
01:59:51,890 --> 01:59:53,710
He's like,
you don't give half.

2613
01:59:53,970 --> 01:59:55,450
I was a kid her half.
He's like,

2614
01:59:55,451 --> 01:59:56,680
it's not half.
He goes,

2615
01:59:56,681 --> 01:59:59,020
it's two thirds because the fucking 
lawyers get a third.

2616
01:59:59,200 --> 02:00:00,730
He likes it's a business.
He's like,

2617
02:00:00,731 --> 02:00:03,310
you have to understand there's a 
business involved in law.

2618
02:00:03,490 --> 02:00:05,290
Who's a business involved in divorce?
First of all,

2619
02:00:05,380 --> 02:00:07,180
he had to pay for her lawyer.
He's like,

2620
02:00:07,210 --> 02:00:09,340
I have to pay for her lawyer.
I have to pay for my lawyer.

2621
02:00:09,580 --> 02:00:14,580
And there's two lawyers.
They're to battle it out and they're 

2622
02:00:14,580 --> 02:00:16,681
gonna.
Drag it out as long as possible to make 

2623
02:00:16,681 --> 02:00:16,681
the most money.

2624
02:00:16,681 --> 02:00:19,980
Just ruin your life.
Oh well they get a percentage and they 

2625
02:00:19,980 --> 02:00:22,120
get legal to get paid by the hour.
So the whole thing is just brutality.

2626
02:00:22,121 --> 02:00:27,121
Keep it going.
And if you have somebody who's a little 

2627
02:00:27,121 --> 02:00:27,121
off,
you can just keep fueling the fire.

2628
02:00:27,121 --> 02:00:28,030
Just keep it going.
Well,

2629
02:00:28,031 --> 02:00:29,560
you know Carla blow.
Yeah.

2630
02:00:29,680 --> 02:00:30,730
Okay.
How about this one?

2631
02:00:31,140 --> 02:00:36,140
Carlo,
who used to be in the outlaws of comedy 

2632
02:00:36,140 --> 02:00:37,900
with Sam Kinison,
Sam Kinison Fuck Carla Bose wife and got

2633
02:00:37,901 --> 02:00:39,760
her pregnant.
Was Bo,

2634
02:00:39,761 --> 02:00:42,940
was raising Sam kinisons child thinking 
it was his own.

2635
02:00:43,610 --> 02:00:46,690
He got into DNA test after Sam Kennison 
died,

2636
02:00:47,110 --> 02:00:52,110
found out it wasn't his child,
tried to get out of paying child 

2637
02:00:52,110 --> 02:00:52,110
support.
And they said,

2638
02:00:52,110 --> 02:00:54,640
no,
you have to pay child support forever.

2639
02:00:54,910 --> 02:00:59,910
So Carl Lebow owes hundreds of thousands
of dollars for Sam's baby.

2640
02:01:00,010 --> 02:01:01,000
He,
he first,

2641
02:01:01,010 --> 02:01:03,040
Sam's baby,
he's fucked.

2642
02:01:03,160 --> 02:01:03,940
He,
um,

2643
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,580
his credit is ruined.
He doesn't have a car.

2644
02:01:06,790 --> 02:01:07,240
I mean,
he's,

2645
02:01:07,270 --> 02:01:11,920
he's devastated by this.
Just a working comic to comic.

2646
02:01:12,010 --> 02:01:12,790
Yeah,
I mean not,

2647
02:01:12,820 --> 02:01:15,690
not.
I mean a road comic road guy who does it

2648
02:01:15,700 --> 02:01:17,650
does well.
It does headlines,

2649
02:01:18,190 --> 02:01:20,470
but he can't see.
It's not like A.

2650
02:01:20,560 --> 02:01:20,890
Yeah.
But.

2651
02:01:20,930 --> 02:01:24,730
So he tried to fight it and lost.
And so now because he lost,

2652
02:01:24,731 --> 02:01:29,731
he has to pay,
but he's responsible for another man's 

2653
02:01:29,731 --> 02:01:31,000
child because his wife had an affair and
it doesn't matter.

2654
02:01:31,060 --> 02:01:36,060
Why does that not matter?
Because we are living in a system that 

2655
02:01:36,060 --> 02:01:37,960
looked limit or fucked over in this 
country.

2656
02:01:37,990 --> 02:01:40,070
Let's just,
let's just make this as a caveat.

2657
02:01:40,220 --> 02:01:42,470
Women get fucked over in this country 
all the time.

2658
02:01:42,680 --> 02:01:44,120
I mean there.
Absolutely.

2659
02:01:45,230 --> 02:01:50,230
Besides what we're talking about with 
men that are willing to drop pills and 

2660
02:01:50,230 --> 02:01:54,071
girls drinks,
there's women that work in offices with 

2661
02:01:54,071 --> 02:01:56,861
pieces of shit for bosses and they 
sexually harassed them and fuck with 

2662
02:01:56,861 --> 02:02:00,911
them and make their life was horrible 
and create this boy's club environment 

2663
02:02:00,911 --> 02:02:01,010
that makes it terrible for them to work 
in.

2664
02:02:01,160 --> 02:02:03,110
There's absolutely.
That is absolutely key,

2665
02:02:03,380 --> 02:02:08,380
but when it comes to divorce and when it
comes to a man who makes money and the,

2666
02:02:08,770 --> 02:02:11,690
the preying upon that,
man that happens.

2667
02:02:12,020 --> 02:02:14,330
It's fucking Hoe.
It's horrific.

2668
02:02:14,660 --> 02:02:17,000
It's horrific.
That should be a documentary.

2669
02:02:17,460 --> 02:02:22,460
It's so much a follow those stories 
around like being really because people 

2670
02:02:22,460 --> 02:02:22,630
don't know those stories.
Yeah.

2671
02:02:22,640 --> 02:02:24,180
An inconvenient truth.
Yes.

2672
02:02:24,260 --> 02:02:27,380
Another one rather inconvenient truth.
So it's,

2673
02:02:27,400 --> 02:02:28,940
you know,
it's bad man.

2674
02:02:28,970 --> 02:02:32,630
There's a lot of California,
California,

2675
02:02:33,110 --> 02:02:37,070
California has that law and in some ways
I kind of understand because like,

2676
02:02:37,071 --> 02:02:38,210
look,
um,

2677
02:02:38,211 --> 02:02:41,660
I have a stepdaughter and she's,
as far as I feel she's my daughter.

2678
02:02:41,661 --> 02:02:46,661
I mean,
I treat her like she's my daughter and 

2679
02:02:46,661 --> 02:02:49,030
if I found out that one of my actual 
daughters was actually not my biological

2680
02:02:49,461 --> 02:02:51,170
daughter,
I wouldn't love them any less.

2681
02:02:51,210 --> 02:02:56,210
No.
I wouldn't want my wife to get giant 

2682
02:02:56,210 --> 02:02:58,820
chunks of money because of it,
but if it was about supporting the kid,

2683
02:02:59,210 --> 02:03:00,470
I would never change that.

2684
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:03,830
I've never changed that because that's.
But his case is more than that.

2685
02:03:03,831 --> 02:03:05,450
It's to support her also.
Well,

2686
02:03:05,451 --> 02:03:07,220
that's a fucked up situation,
man.

2687
02:03:07,221 --> 02:03:10,460
It's God Damn Sam Kennison like,
why doesn't the Sam kinison estate,

2688
02:03:10,520 --> 02:03:12,050
I mean,
how much money are they making?

2689
02:03:12,070 --> 02:03:13,310
Right?
How come they're not?

2690
02:03:13,370 --> 02:03:14,680
Why don't they pay it?
Right.

2691
02:03:14,960 --> 02:03:19,960
That's his kid.
You're talking about a wealthy man who 

2692
02:03:19,960 --> 02:03:22,721
died,
who was one of the greatest comics who 

2693
02:03:22,721 --> 02:03:22,721
ever lived.
I could only assume,

2694
02:03:22,721 --> 02:03:26,200
like I read something the other day that
said that Liverpool just Liverpool gets 

2695
02:03:26,200 --> 02:03:28,280
100 million dollars a year from the 
Beatles.

2696
02:03:29,930 --> 02:03:33,490
I don't know how the fuck that works,
but just the tax is involved.

2697
02:03:33,720 --> 02:03:38,720
You know,
the amount of money that they generate 

2698
02:03:38,720 --> 02:03:38,960
from their portfolio,
the taxes from all the sales.

2699
02:03:38,961 --> 02:03:39,920
Who knows?
Right.

2700
02:03:40,700 --> 02:03:42,620
You're not making my innocent anymore 
though.

2701
02:03:42,640 --> 02:03:43,280
Yeah,
Kenny.

2702
02:03:43,310 --> 02:03:45,560
But kennison had generated a few 
million.

2703
02:03:45,740 --> 02:03:47,360
Yeah,
but that's gone.

2704
02:03:48,110 --> 02:03:53,110
Right?
I mean there's a whole generation that 

2705
02:03:53,110 --> 02:03:53,110
doesn't even know Sam anymore.
Unfortunately.

2706
02:03:53,110 --> 02:03:56,420
God isn't crazy as a kid that does a 
great impression of Kennison and it went

2707
02:03:56,421 --> 02:03:57,620
up and crack gas.
Yeah,

2708
02:03:57,621 --> 02:04:01,230
I think so.
Knowing the factory.

2709
02:04:01,260 --> 02:04:02,660
No idea.
Who's talking about.

2710
02:04:02,720 --> 02:04:03,380
Well,
that's the thing.

2711
02:04:03,381 --> 02:04:06,830
We were talking about this Oj case,
like you and I,

2712
02:04:06,950 --> 02:04:09,280
we were around when the Oj trial was 
going on,

2713
02:04:09,680 --> 02:04:14,680
but a lot of kids today,
they don't even fucking have any idea 

2714
02:04:14,680 --> 02:04:14,680
what this about.
No idea.

2715
02:04:14,680 --> 02:04:16,790
We're old dude.
How old are you now?

2716
02:04:17,210 --> 02:04:18,650
How old are you?
Thirty nine.

2717
02:04:18,700 --> 02:04:23,700
I'm 48.
So how old are you for real seven.

2718
02:04:24,350 --> 02:04:25,070
Yeah.
That's funny.

2719
02:04:25,270 --> 02:04:26,850
Yeah,
yeah,

2720
02:04:27,820 --> 02:04:29,510
yeah.
It gets you mad.

2721
02:04:29,570 --> 02:04:31,310
It's all of a sudden you're like,
Holy Shit,

2722
02:04:31,340 --> 02:04:32,190
we've lived.
We've,

2723
02:04:32,470 --> 02:04:35,630
we've been around,
we've seen some shit.

2724
02:04:35,790 --> 02:04:36,980
But then you see people that are older.

2725
02:04:36,990 --> 02:04:38,910
I always gravitate towards those people.
I'm like,

2726
02:04:38,911 --> 02:04:40,650
he's still rocking it.
He's still going.

2727
02:04:40,651 --> 02:04:42,600
Some people are,
but less,

2728
02:04:43,240 --> 02:04:45,610
less white because they die.
But yeah.

2729
02:04:45,611 --> 02:04:46,950
Well,
as you know,

2730
02:04:47,940 --> 02:04:52,940
a,
Jamie and I were just talking about 

2731
02:04:52,940 --> 02:04:52,940
this,
me and Brian Cowen,

2732
02:04:52,940 --> 02:04:54,510
we're uh,
we're doing this podcast the other day,

2733
02:04:54,511 --> 02:04:59,511
about a week there was a,
we do this podcast called the fight 

2734
02:04:59,511 --> 02:05:00,210
companion and it's a,
uh,

2735
02:05:00,240 --> 02:05:02,280
we watched the UFC fights and we talk 
about fighting.

2736
02:05:02,281 --> 02:05:05,370
We'd get drunk and get retarded in one 
of the,

2737
02:05:05,390 --> 02:05:07,640
the little exchanges that we have.
We were,

2738
02:05:07,800 --> 02:05:10,230
Brian was throwing kicks and I was 
teaching them how to throw kicks.

2739
02:05:10,231 --> 02:05:15,231
Right.
And one of the things that people were 

2740
02:05:15,231 --> 02:05:15,231
saying like,
these guys are 50,

2741
02:05:15,231 --> 02:05:15,231
how are they even doing that?
Right.

2742
02:05:15,231 --> 02:05:15,510
Jesus Christ,
like they think we're dead.

2743
02:05:16,500 --> 02:05:17,220
But then I'm like,
well,

2744
02:05:17,221 --> 02:05:18,840
how many people do I know that are 50 
that are,

2745
02:05:18,841 --> 02:05:19,980
that are taking care of themselves?

2746
02:05:19,980 --> 02:05:21,930
Yeah.
It gets a number.

2747
02:05:21,960 --> 02:05:23,010
I know,
you know,

2748
02:05:23,011 --> 02:05:28,011
I'm 40 years old when I'm 90.
I'm probably not gonna be able to do 

2749
02:05:28,070 --> 02:05:29,940
anything.
That's just a fact.

2750
02:05:29,941 --> 02:05:33,870
So I'm halfway to not being mobile.
Do any of that.

2751
02:05:33,900 --> 02:05:34,700
Yeah man.
I mean,

2752
02:05:34,710 --> 02:05:39,710
what at what level?
At what age do you get where your body 

2753
02:05:39,710 --> 02:05:39,710
just doesn't work right anymore?
All right,

2754
02:05:39,710 --> 02:05:41,370
well that's the thing,
if you're active,

2755
02:05:41,371 --> 02:05:43,230
you gotta stay active,
you got to stay.

2756
02:05:43,231 --> 02:05:46,470
I mean no joke and when going to that 
yoga class where it's,

2757
02:05:46,770 --> 02:05:51,770
you know,
the after drop off and there's some 

2758
02:05:51,770 --> 02:05:53,961
older people to see like a 70 year old 
woman and they're like standing on her 

2759
02:05:53,961 --> 02:05:57,981
head and doing a backward backbend 
because she kept doing that.

2760
02:05:58,351 --> 02:06:03,351
That's why she's able to do that now.
That's one of the things is the place 

2761
02:06:03,351 --> 02:06:07,041
that I go to a some really good 
instructors and one of the things that 

2762
02:06:07,041 --> 02:06:07,170
this lady was talking about was she's in
her,

2763
02:06:07,710 --> 02:06:12,360
I want to say she's in her sixties and 
she was saying that if you just maintain

2764
02:06:12,361 --> 02:06:17,361
your practice and keep doing it,
you can be healthy and mobile deepen 

2765
02:06:17,361 --> 02:06:17,361
your nineties.

2766
02:06:17,361 --> 02:06:19,590
A lot of it is just people neglecting 
their body.

2767
02:06:19,620 --> 02:06:21,600
Atrophy were just.
Yeah,

2768
02:06:22,010 --> 02:06:23,910
you see people that can't even touch 
their toes anymore.

2769
02:06:24,440 --> 02:06:29,440
It's weird.
I got to go to the gym and as you get 

2770
02:06:29,440 --> 02:06:33,141
older,
one really important thing is lifting 

2771
02:06:33,141 --> 02:06:35,331
weights.
It's very important for older people 

2772
02:06:35,331 --> 02:06:37,760
because you need to maintain muscle mass
just to avoid being injured and bone 

2773
02:06:37,760 --> 02:06:41,151
density don't they say like you have to 
really Max out as much as you can up 

2774
02:06:41,151 --> 02:06:43,200
until up to 50.
Like it's because that's when you really

2775
02:06:43,201 --> 02:06:45,120
start to fall off muscle wise.

2776
02:06:46,340 --> 02:06:47,660
Um,
I dunno,

2777
02:06:48,170 --> 02:06:49,180
I haven't heard that.
No,

2778
02:06:49,550 --> 02:06:50,000
you're,
you're,

2779
02:06:50,001 --> 02:06:55,001
you're slowly falling off from the time 
you're like 30 is the whole key is just 

2780
02:06:55,820 --> 02:07:00,590
maintaining a level of activity.
You have to maintain a level of activity

2781
02:07:00,591 --> 02:07:04,460
but also maintain a level of 
maintenance.

2782
02:07:04,610 --> 02:07:08,240
And that's where I really love yoga 
because yoga is taken care of.

2783
02:07:08,241 --> 02:07:13,241
A lot of,
like weird back pains that I used to 

2784
02:07:13,241 --> 02:07:15,191
have and things and weird shit.
It's weird isn't all of a sudden all 

2785
02:07:15,191 --> 02:07:15,830
this goes away.
All that tensions.

2786
02:07:15,850 --> 02:07:17,300
Yeah.
I haven't gone to amazing.

2787
02:07:17,330 --> 02:07:18,410
It is amazing.
It's,

2788
02:07:18,411 --> 02:07:20,990
there's a reason why those skinny 
motherfuckers in India been doing it for

2789
02:07:20,991 --> 02:07:22,250
a thousand years.
You're right.

2790
02:07:22,370 --> 02:07:24,330
It's really good for you.
I know it's.

2791
02:07:24,680 --> 02:07:25,850
Do you do it high?
Ever do it,

2792
02:07:25,851 --> 02:07:26,000
Huh?

2793
02:07:26,180 --> 02:07:26,850
No,
no,

2794
02:07:27,090 --> 02:07:28,280
no,
no,

2795
02:07:28,610 --> 02:07:29,960
no.
Really?

2796
02:07:30,060 --> 02:07:32,970
Yeah.
Where do you get high?

2797
02:07:33,060 --> 02:07:35,230
How often you get high?
Not that often anymore.

2798
02:07:35,520 --> 02:07:36,070
What does that mean?

2799
02:07:36,220 --> 02:07:37,870
Once a month.
Once a year.

2800
02:07:38,020 --> 02:07:39,570
Once every couple of months.
Yeah.

2801
02:07:39,730 --> 02:07:42,130
You should do it.
I want to do it all the time.

2802
02:07:42,280 --> 02:07:46,410
If you don't have anything to do during 
the day that happened,

2803
02:07:46,650 --> 02:07:51,650
we'll just take a day.
Take a day where you tell your agent or 

2804
02:07:51,650 --> 02:07:51,650
whoever the fuck it is.
It bothers you.

2805
02:07:51,650 --> 02:07:53,890
Say,
listen off the fucking grid today.

2806
02:07:53,920 --> 02:07:56,080
Then I'm also telling my wife,
I'm not picking the kids up.

2807
02:07:56,370 --> 02:07:59,470
I'm not doing this.
No time do you have to pick your kids up

2808
02:07:59,650 --> 02:08:01,150
for,
for you're good.

2809
02:08:01,390 --> 02:08:02,440
Take a 9:00
AM class.

2810
02:08:02,470 --> 02:08:03,400
You'll be fine.
Yeah.

2811
02:08:03,560 --> 02:08:06,310
Just get barbecued.
Drop the kids off,

2812
02:08:06,340 --> 02:08:11,340
drop the kids off,
take four strong hits and go to yoga 

2813
02:08:11,340 --> 02:08:14,101
class.
Really will feel your body in a way 

2814
02:08:14,101 --> 02:08:16,321
where you never felt it before.
You'll feel like your vertebrae 

2815
02:08:16,321 --> 02:08:17,830
stretching and the tissue in your neck 
loosening and it's like,

2816
02:08:18,670 --> 02:08:19,810
I'm doing that tomorrow.

2817
02:08:19,900 --> 02:08:24,900
Well,
that's one of the secrets of the 

2818
02:08:24,900 --> 02:08:25,510
[inaudible] and the Yogis of India is 
they would.

2819
02:08:25,830 --> 02:08:28,090
They would smoke all these chillums,
they would smoke,

2820
02:08:28,091 --> 02:08:31,940
hash the hash heads,
and they would go and do their practice.

2821
02:08:31,960 --> 02:08:33,850
That's really a big part of it.
Yeah.

2822
02:08:33,970 --> 02:08:35,620
I'm going to try it.
I wanted it so bad.

2823
02:08:35,621 --> 02:08:37,470
I can completely.
Yeah,

2824
02:08:37,540 --> 02:08:39,400
could fill it for the first time in my 
life,

2825
02:08:39,430 --> 02:08:44,430
I've always been active always for the 
first time in my life I have this issue 

2826
02:08:44,430 --> 02:08:46,570
where I've got a muscle under here under
the first rib.

2827
02:08:46,660 --> 02:08:51,660
It's tight and it's affecting back here 
down to my arm and it's affecting how 

2828
02:08:53,350 --> 02:08:56,860
it's cutting off whatever nerves are 
running down here.

2829
02:08:56,890 --> 02:08:59,360
Oh,
it's like it's cutting.

2830
02:08:59,730 --> 02:09:01,330
It's raising the.
This rib,

2831
02:09:01,630 --> 02:09:02,960
it's actually.
It's a stall.

2832
02:09:02,961 --> 02:09:07,961
Tight muscles tightened.
The rib is pulled up and it's pinching 

2833
02:09:07,961 --> 02:09:09,220
on the stuff that's coming down.

2834
02:09:09,220 --> 02:09:11,590
Do you feel any numbness?
Sometimes.

2835
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:14,350
Okay,
and so going to this great guy,

2836
02:09:15,030 --> 02:09:16,990
he's great.
He works with the clippers and stuff and

2837
02:09:16,991 --> 02:09:19,840
he's knows exactly where it is and he's.
And it's helping,

2838
02:09:20,340 --> 02:09:22,030
but he's like,
what do not sleep on?

2839
02:09:22,031 --> 02:09:27,031
Your stomach just goes in and loosens it
up and it's basically just kind of 

2840
02:09:27,031 --> 02:09:30,310
releasing the tension of tissue and it's
working and feel it,

2841
02:09:30,370 --> 02:09:31,750
you know,
it's only a couple of times.

2842
02:09:32,440 --> 02:09:34,480
And uh,
there's two parts of this.

2843
02:09:34,481 --> 02:09:39,481
One is I can't sleep.
I sleep on my stomach with my head to 

2844
02:09:39,481 --> 02:09:40,010
the side.
I used to do that.

2845
02:09:40,011 --> 02:09:42,750
I fucked my neck up doing that.
That's exactly what happened.

2846
02:09:42,790 --> 02:09:44,380
And it's really,
that's the cause,

2847
02:09:44,410 --> 02:09:47,410
the cause of it and I,
but my sleep,

2848
02:09:47,650 --> 02:09:51,670
I'm used to doing that my whole life.
Now I'm laying on my back.

2849
02:09:52,060 --> 02:09:53,800
It's so hard to sleep.

2850
02:09:54,280 --> 02:09:55,960
I lay on my side.
You do?

2851
02:09:55,990 --> 02:09:56,830
Yeah.
I lay on my side.

2852
02:09:56,831 --> 02:09:59,410
I put a pillow in between my legs.
I lay on my side.

2853
02:10:00,070 --> 02:10:01,030
This is,
I literally,

2854
02:10:01,031 --> 02:10:06,031
when I was driving here,
it's like Joe will know I had the same 

2855
02:10:06,031 --> 02:10:06,190
exact issue by the denial.
Yeah.

2856
02:10:06,220 --> 02:10:08,660
Before I hurt my neck,
hurt my neck from Jujitsu.

2857
02:10:08,710 --> 02:10:11,800
But before I did that,
I started developing problems in my neck

2858
02:10:11,801 --> 02:10:13,420
from laying down.
That's it.

2859
02:10:13,870 --> 02:10:16,490
I had no idea.
It was just from laying down on your.

2860
02:10:16,491 --> 02:10:19,900
Especially if you laid down flat within,
turn your head in the same way,

2861
02:10:20,170 --> 02:10:21,730
right?
Always turn your head to the right.

2862
02:10:21,760 --> 02:10:22,690
Always.
You're fucked.

2863
02:10:23,830 --> 02:10:25,600
If you ever heard of those cab drivers 
develop.

2864
02:10:25,601 --> 02:10:29,620
Swollen discs are bulging discs because 
they sit with a wallet in their pocket.

2865
02:10:30,250 --> 02:10:35,250
Right?
Because just that lifting of your butt 

2866
02:10:35,250 --> 02:10:35,250
cheek,
that an inch on

2867
02:10:35,250 --> 02:10:37,360
one side fucks your backup repeatedly.
Yeah,

2868
02:10:37,430 --> 02:10:38,960
because that's what you're doing when 
you're sleeping.

2869
02:10:39,090 --> 02:10:40,300
Yeah,
it's really bad for you.

2870
02:10:40,910 --> 02:10:45,650
Tissue is really pliable.
It is like everything's out of whack.

2871
02:10:45,651 --> 02:10:49,100
So you have to kind of like reset it.
They'll reset me and then it's like,

2872
02:10:49,370 --> 02:10:54,370
all right,
just don't lift your arm and try and be 

2873
02:10:54,370 --> 02:10:54,370
cool and just kind of let it learn that 
it's got.

2874
02:10:54,370 --> 02:10:56,030
It's back in its place.
You see that little ball?

2875
02:10:56,031 --> 02:11:01,031
That little blue ball right here.
Hold on a little balloon behind the 

2876
02:11:01,431 --> 02:11:02,840
creepy guy.
Oh,

2877
02:11:02,841 --> 02:11:03,680
this heavy.
Oh,

2878
02:11:03,681 --> 02:11:05,420
what's this?
That is a,

2879
02:11:05,480 --> 02:11:10,190
that's called a mobilitywod supernova.
That's a smaller one.

2880
02:11:10,191 --> 02:11:13,130
I actually prefer there's a larger one 
that we have around here somewhere.

2881
02:11:13,550 --> 02:11:14,000
Um,
I,

2882
02:11:14,050 --> 02:11:16,480
I give them to people because I want 
people to use these things.

2883
02:11:16,500 --> 02:11:21,500
People have sore backs.
Will you do is you put it on the ground 

2884
02:11:21,500 --> 02:11:24,761
or on a wall and you back up against it 
and like put your weight on it and you 

2885
02:11:24,761 --> 02:11:29,291
rub it up and down,
like you roll the ball and it breaks up 

2886
02:11:29,291 --> 02:11:32,900
all the scar tissue and loosens up all 
the tendons and all the Fascia.

2887
02:11:33,800 --> 02:11:35,510
It's painful,
but if you get them,

2888
02:11:35,511 --> 02:11:37,990
if you can bite your teeth and get 
through it,

2889
02:11:38,180 --> 02:11:41,000
it'll make a significant difference in 
loosening up your muscles.

2890
02:11:41,030 --> 02:11:44,630
It's such a strange idea.
Like I've never had any issue.

2891
02:11:45,020 --> 02:11:47,300
I've worked out.
I was an athlete my whole life and never

2892
02:11:47,360 --> 02:11:49,010
literally I've ever been like,
oh,

2893
02:11:49,011 --> 02:11:54,011
that hurt for the first time and I had 
no idea the concept that all the tissue 

2894
02:11:54,171 --> 02:11:57,950
and tendons are just tightening and I'm 
just ending up like,

2895
02:11:58,310 --> 02:12:00,620
like a,
like a hunchback will.

2896
02:12:00,621 --> 02:12:05,621
That's all one of the things that pot 
will help because we feel all those 

2897
02:12:05,621 --> 02:12:06,920
things.
You feel tense like marijuana.

2898
02:12:06,950 --> 02:12:10,250
It's almost like it.
Whatever sensitivity you have about your

2899
02:12:10,251 --> 02:12:12,880
body awareness ramps it up to 10 
minutes.

2900
02:12:12,920 --> 02:12:15,080
Why sex feels so good when you.
When you smoke,

2901
02:12:15,740 --> 02:12:17,900
because it just ramps up all the 
feeling.

2902
02:12:17,910 --> 02:12:22,910
It's just.
It changes the way you interface with 

2903
02:12:22,910 --> 02:12:22,910
the nerve endings.

2904
02:12:22,910 --> 02:12:24,500
I'm scared now to lift for the first 
time.

2905
02:12:24,501 --> 02:12:28,220
I'm not lifting railing for like since 
like October.

2906
02:12:28,300 --> 02:12:33,300
Ooh,
that's not good because that'll fuck it 

2907
02:12:33,300 --> 02:12:33,300
up even more because you're right.
Yeah.

2908
02:12:33,300 --> 02:12:37,141
You lose strength in your back.
You need to go to a personal trainer 

2909
02:12:37,141 --> 02:12:40,961
that understands how to strengthen that 
area to keep this whole thing from 

2910
02:12:40,961 --> 02:12:40,961
happening.
I mean,

2911
02:12:40,961 --> 02:12:43,430
he works with the clippers.
He's and he's running two times and it's

2912
02:12:43,431 --> 02:12:44,000
like,
all right,

2913
02:12:44,030 --> 02:12:47,390
we're onto it sounds.
You have a good massage therapist guy,

2914
02:12:47,391 --> 02:12:48,140
right?
That's what he does.

2915
02:12:48,141 --> 02:12:50,480
He's massage.
She said he's like a chiropractor.

2916
02:12:51,080 --> 02:12:53,630
See,
I think I am practice mostly bullshit.

2917
02:12:53,660 --> 02:12:55,670
I don't know if he's physical therapist 
or chiropractor.

2918
02:12:55,671 --> 02:13:00,671
I don't know what it is.
I think chiropractors are mostly 

2919
02:13:00,671 --> 02:13:01,470
bullshit.
Nonsense.

2920
02:13:01,500 --> 02:13:02,230
Yeah.
Yeah.

2921
02:13:02,240 --> 02:13:06,640
I think they're mostly bullshit,
but one of the things that they do do is

2922
02:13:06,650 --> 02:13:11,650
all the other stuff outside of cracking,
like cold lasers work and massage work.

2923
02:13:12,590 --> 02:13:17,590
There's a lot of other different 
effective methods of alleviating 

2924
02:13:17,590 --> 02:13:18,080
pressure,
intention that work,

2925
02:13:18,470 --> 02:13:23,470
but all that back cracking stuff.
If you talk to like most people that,

2926
02:13:24,111 --> 02:13:26,630
uh,
that study it and then try to figure out

2927
02:13:26,631 --> 02:13:29,030
what exactly they're doing like this.
They're not doing anything.

2928
02:13:29,330 --> 02:13:32,220
They're popping things in place and if 
you have something really fucked

2929
02:13:32,220 --> 02:13:32,610
up,
yeah,

2930
02:13:32,620 --> 02:13:37,620
maybe.
Maybe if something's like really out of 

2931
02:13:37,620 --> 02:13:37,980
whack and they can straighten it out,
most of the time that's not what's going

2932
02:13:37,981 --> 02:13:42,981
on.
Most of the time you're just getting 

2933
02:13:42,981 --> 02:13:44,511
this sort of placebo effect where 
they're pushing on your back and making 

2934
02:13:44,511 --> 02:13:44,511
a noise.
Pop.

2935
02:13:44,511 --> 02:13:44,511
Pop.
We got it.

2936
02:13:44,511 --> 02:13:45,810
We got it right.
You're good at Tom.

2937
02:13:45,811 --> 02:13:46,580
You're like,
I'm good.

2938
02:13:47,720 --> 02:13:49,360
I'm good.
I'm feeling right now.

2939
02:13:49,490 --> 02:13:50,820
This guy.
I mean,

2940
02:13:50,821 --> 02:13:52,620
I was really a mess.
Yeah.

2941
02:13:52,770 --> 02:13:54,950
I mean I literally couldn't go like this
without this.

2942
02:13:54,960 --> 02:13:57,030
Just going numb.
And uh,

2943
02:13:57,540 --> 02:13:59,850
he got,
I mean he was just like,

2944
02:13:59,880 --> 02:14:00,630
no,
it's right in here.

2945
02:14:00,631 --> 02:14:03,930
But at the tent and then cool for,
you know,

2946
02:14:03,931 --> 02:14:07,620
a week and then I'm sleeping.
I'm literally going to do it every week.

2947
02:14:07,650 --> 02:14:09,150
Yeah.
I got to loosen it up.

2948
02:14:09,151 --> 02:14:10,950
I mean,
it sounds a bit of a real.

2949
02:14:11,370 --> 02:14:12,350
Have you ever gotten your ad?

2950
02:14:12,360 --> 02:14:17,360
Rolfing done.
Rolfing thing is like a very painful 

2951
02:14:17,360 --> 02:14:18,350
method of deep tissue massage where 
they're,

2952
02:14:18,370 --> 02:14:23,370
they're stretching out your fascia and 
facing up all these binding to negative 

2953
02:14:23,701 --> 02:14:25,380
scar tissue,
all that stuff.

2954
02:14:25,740 --> 02:14:27,020
And uh,
that,

2955
02:14:27,050 --> 02:14:30,960
that can be super effective with all the
scar tissue just from whatever abuse you

2956
02:14:30,961 --> 02:14:33,760
didn't.
Life muscle polls that funny.

2957
02:14:33,920 --> 02:14:35,250
Oh really?
Healed tents up me.

2958
02:14:35,300 --> 02:14:40,300
Especially if you have a bad poll.
I've had a bunch of them or scar tissue 

2959
02:14:40,300 --> 02:14:42,480
all over my back.
But I think yoga fixed a lot of it,

2960
02:14:42,600 --> 02:14:44,480
like really a lot.
I don't have any issues.

2961
02:14:44,481 --> 02:14:49,481
No,
but I do feel like as much as I love 

2962
02:14:49,481 --> 02:14:51,861
yoga,
I do feel like you'd have to keep 

2963
02:14:51,861 --> 02:14:51,861
lifting.
Yes.

2964
02:14:51,861 --> 02:14:52,020
And I haven't literally because this 
started getting,

2965
02:14:52,050 --> 02:14:54,000
becoming a problem like around October,
November,

2966
02:14:54,480 --> 02:14:57,660
and I literally feel like soft.
Yeah.

2967
02:14:57,670 --> 02:14:59,800
The people that don't think that,
you know,

2968
02:14:59,801 --> 02:15:01,470
and I don't,
I just don't think they're right.

2969
02:15:01,800 --> 02:15:04,740
If you talk to people that are experts 
in physical culture,

2970
02:15:04,741 --> 02:15:06,660
you know,
people that really understand like what,

2971
02:15:06,690 --> 02:15:09,000
what did you do,
what do you need to do to keep your body

2972
02:15:09,001 --> 02:15:14,001
at its most effective operating level?
And they say it's a bunch of different 

2973
02:15:14,041 --> 02:15:15,930
stuff.
It's like you have to do cardio,

2974
02:15:15,931 --> 02:15:17,940
you have to lift weights,
you have to stretch.

2975
02:15:18,300 --> 02:15:19,720
Yoga is part of that.
Yeah,

2976
02:15:19,721 --> 02:15:20,890
it's part of it.
I was just,

2977
02:15:21,170 --> 02:15:26,170
I was just in Hawaii doing a Gig and uh,
I at the pool and just like,

2978
02:15:26,581 --> 02:15:28,260
you know,
they have no kids pool,

2979
02:15:28,261 --> 02:15:33,261
like the serenity pool kind of thing.
So there and so it's all guys that are 

2980
02:15:33,261 --> 02:15:33,261
like,
you know,

2981
02:15:33,261 --> 02:15:38,060
late thirties to mid sixties.
Every guy walking around there was guys 

2982
02:15:38,851 --> 02:15:40,450
that were athletic,
you know,

2983
02:15:40,750 --> 02:15:45,750
you could tell.
And then there's guys that are a 

2984
02:15:45,750 --> 02:15:45,750
complete mess.
And then there's a whole bunch of in the

2985
02:15:45,750 --> 02:15:45,750
middle.

2986
02:15:45,750 --> 02:15:50,540
The Dad Bod,
the dad bod a little pudgy and no 

2987
02:15:50,540 --> 02:15:50,540
shoulders.
They all,

2988
02:15:50,550 --> 02:15:54,360
their shoulders have disappeared and you
can just see it just a bone bone went in

2989
02:15:54,361 --> 02:15:57,000
to.
I don't want to be ready to tear off.

2990
02:15:57,290 --> 02:16:02,290
It's really tried to pick up a suitcase 
and it just from your basic life,

2991
02:16:03,310 --> 02:16:05,400
it can't end up like that.
No,

2992
02:16:05,520 --> 02:16:06,480
he can't.
Well,

2993
02:16:06,481 --> 02:16:08,790
some people,
they don't have a job like we have.

2994
02:16:09,370 --> 02:16:10,590
You know?
It's hard.

2995
02:16:10,870 --> 02:16:15,870
That's what I was talking about.
My friend who got divorced and fucked 

2996
02:16:15,870 --> 02:16:15,870
over the guy works 12 hours a day.
Yeah.

2997
02:16:15,870 --> 02:16:17,190
When is he gonna?
Go to the gym.

2998
02:16:17,220 --> 02:16:18,510
He probably wouldn't be better off 
though.

2999
02:16:18,540 --> 02:16:21,360
He gets a trainer and sometimes he goes 
on his lunch break and stuff like that.

3000
02:16:21,361 --> 02:16:24,710
But the reality is he's working.
Yeah know.

3001
02:16:24,960 --> 02:16:27,270
I know you got to pay for his fucking 
divorce,

3002
02:16:28,020 --> 02:16:30,990
but if you work out then it's kind of 
like a.

3003
02:16:31,090 --> 02:16:36,090
your antidepressants.
She moved to Argentina should just 

3004
02:16:36,090 --> 02:16:38,670
stockpile all of his cash,
get a fake fucking passport and just 

3005
02:16:38,670 --> 02:16:39,970
you're on your own hook and just go.
They can't come get you.

3006
02:16:39,971 --> 02:16:42,310
Right.
If they don't know where he is,

3007
02:16:42,340 --> 02:16:43,570
they can't come get you.
I mean,

3008
02:16:43,571 --> 02:16:46,180
it's not like he's like,
I couldn't live with the paranoia.

3009
02:16:46,960 --> 02:16:47,810
That's true.
Especially Thinking,

3010
02:16:47,880 --> 02:16:50,920
Oh,
you're on the beach having a great time.

3011
02:16:52,300 --> 02:16:55,540
This is the life and the best.
They catch me and then it's not the life

3012
02:16:56,190 --> 02:16:57,480
in prison.
You a card.

3013
02:16:57,510 --> 02:16:59,740
Yeah,
everybody does.

3014
02:16:59,741 --> 02:17:00,940
You don't have one I don't like.
Yeah.

3015
02:17:00,941 --> 02:17:02,170
You want.
I've been so out of it.

3016
02:17:02,230 --> 02:17:04,740
Come on.
I know.

3017
02:17:04,870 --> 02:17:07,090
Just bring you to a place.
This is Tom Papa.

3018
02:17:07,091 --> 02:17:08,530
Hi Tom.
What's going on?

3019
02:17:08,531 --> 02:17:09,370
I need pot.
Okay.

3020
02:17:10,760 --> 02:17:15,760
I'm so out of it.
After I was every day for like a decade 

3021
02:17:15,760 --> 02:17:17,380
and then just stopped.

3022
02:17:17,560 --> 02:17:19,510
Stopped.
It's hard when you have responsibilities

3023
02:17:19,511 --> 02:17:22,390
too and I wasn't as funny.
It was hurting my funny.

3024
02:17:22,430 --> 02:17:24,310
Was it really?
It was making me lethargic.

3025
02:17:24,460 --> 02:17:25,750
Oh,
he was making me.

3026
02:17:26,200 --> 02:17:29,920
Yeah,
it was making me a not as funny.

3027
02:17:30,070 --> 02:17:35,070
Well there's different kinds of pot to 
and there's different reactions people 

3028
02:17:35,070 --> 02:17:35,410
have to pot like some people.
Pot.

3029
02:17:35,710 --> 02:17:38,200
Pot makes me more actively but are not.
Yeah,

3030
02:17:38,260 --> 02:17:40,080
kind of me up.
Yeah.

3031
02:17:40,130 --> 02:17:41,860
Sativas,
especially right now,

3032
02:17:41,880 --> 02:17:46,880
it makes me like really ramped up like I
want to like go watch documentaries on 

3033
02:17:46,880 --> 02:17:48,430
space,
write shit down.

3034
02:17:49,310 --> 02:17:54,310
Sometimes I'll smoke pot before I get 
into a sensory deprivation tank and I 

3035
02:17:54,310 --> 02:17:57,091
don't get,
I don't even get into the tank because 

3036
02:17:57,091 --> 02:17:59,251
they have an idea and I have to write 
and find myself in front of my computer 

3037
02:17:59,251 --> 02:17:59,320
for hours.
That's sativa.

3038
02:17:59,321 --> 02:18:00,320
Does that?
Yeah.

3039
02:18:00,540 --> 02:18:02,630
Yeah.
And what's the other kind?

3040
02:18:02,920 --> 02:18:04,010
Indigo?
Indigo.

3041
02:18:04,110 --> 02:18:05,770
Indigo is like the couch.
We,

3042
02:18:05,771 --> 02:18:08,740
that's the physical.
The physical.

3043
02:18:08,760 --> 02:18:09,490
Yeah.
They're both,

3044
02:18:09,520 --> 02:18:11,410
but it's not.
It's more of a sedative.

3045
02:18:11,470 --> 02:18:12,190
Right,
right,

3046
02:18:12,191 --> 02:18:12,670
right.
More.

3047
02:18:12,850 --> 02:18:14,500
Let's look.
It's great for people in pain,

3048
02:18:14,610 --> 02:18:16,840
like glitter and a lot of pain.
Love Indycar,

3049
02:18:16,841 --> 02:18:18,470
like back pain,
like Oh,

3050
02:18:19,780 --> 02:18:22,450
relaxes them.
Is there anything to with Neil young was

3051
02:18:22,451 --> 02:18:26,470
talking about of chewing a coffee.
Beans makes you less paranoid.

3052
02:18:27,080 --> 02:18:32,080
You ever heard that one?
Caffeine definitely alleviates a lot of 

3053
02:18:32,080 --> 02:18:32,940
the issues with thc.
You know,

3054
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:38,000
if you're really too high,
the best thing you can do is drink 

3055
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:38,000
something with caffeine in it.
Oh yeah.

3056
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:38,070
Yeah.
It's,

3057
02:18:38,170 --> 02:18:41,020
it's severely mitigates the effects of 
thc.

3058
02:18:41,021 --> 02:18:42,800
Like if you,
if you go to like,

3059
02:18:42,801 --> 02:18:44,980
if you're a fucking way too hot,
just go to starbucks,

3060
02:18:44,981 --> 02:18:48,130
get vente Ralphie and just sit down,
relax.

3061
02:18:48,470 --> 02:18:53,470
It'll,
the caffeine will have a pretty big 

3062
02:18:53,470 --> 02:18:53,470
impact.

3063
02:18:53,470 --> 02:18:53,800
But coffee beans,
um,

3064
02:18:53,920 --> 02:18:58,920
especially like raw coffee,
like coffee beans are very healthy for 

3065
02:18:58,920 --> 02:18:58,920
you.
Yeah.

3066
02:18:58,920 --> 02:18:59,920
Yeah.
Like the actual been itself,

3067
02:18:59,980 --> 02:19:02,410
especially the outside of the coffee 
bean,

3068
02:19:02,411 --> 02:19:06,100
like the green part of the coffee bean.
Very high in antioxidants.

3069
02:19:06,790 --> 02:19:08,590
I figured Neil young with new,
you know,

3070
02:19:08,591 --> 02:19:09,850
it's funny,
it's Kinda like,

3071
02:19:09,910 --> 02:19:11,290
it's Kinda like when you come back to a 
sport,

3072
02:19:11,291 --> 02:19:16,291
like I was into cycling for awhile and 
then like didn't do it and then came 

3073
02:19:16,291 --> 02:19:17,800
back like eight years later and it's 
like the whole sport had changed.

3074
02:19:18,010 --> 02:19:21,970
It just evolved so quickly and everybody
knew different carbon fiber and all this

3075
02:19:21,971 --> 02:19:23,650
different kind of.
That's the same thing with weed.

3076
02:19:23,651 --> 02:19:25,120
It's like I've been out of it.
So you come back,

3077
02:19:25,121 --> 02:19:27,230
you know,
this whole bunch of new things.

3078
02:19:27,231 --> 02:19:30,750
Now there's vape pens and sour gummies 
tablets.

3079
02:19:30,980 --> 02:19:32,750
The kids try to get you to do dabs.

3080
02:19:33,230 --> 02:19:35,510
Wacky fucking kids.
You ever heard of the data?

3081
02:19:35,970 --> 02:19:37,070
Oh my God,
that's that.

3082
02:19:37,160 --> 02:19:38,090
It's uh,
it's,

3083
02:19:38,140 --> 02:19:43,140
it's really like you have all this 
equipment and you're taking thc wax and 

3084
02:19:43,831 --> 02:19:47,420
you're fucking going to stick and 
fucking torch.

3085
02:19:47,421 --> 02:19:49,010
It's stupid.
I don't want to go old school.

3086
02:19:49,011 --> 02:19:50,440
I want to be fluffy.
Oh,

3087
02:19:50,441 --> 02:19:53,120
a big fluffy tree that I could see and 
feel.

3088
02:19:53,121 --> 02:19:56,190
And how about joints?
Joint one.

3089
02:19:56,260 --> 02:19:58,100
I'd like to separate now it's like a 
simple.

3090
02:19:58,170 --> 02:19:59,300
No,
no.

3091
02:19:59,440 --> 02:20:01,130
While we're here,
my tests little dry.

3092
02:20:01,690 --> 02:20:05,660
I'll just get you to carry him around in
a case like a fucking gentleman.

3093
02:20:08,060 --> 02:20:09,980
Then you got to show it in.
Are you doing a show tonight?

3094
02:20:12,390 --> 02:20:17,390
Be Out of my head.
I'll smoke this right before I go on 

3095
02:20:17,390 --> 02:20:17,390
stage.
Do you really?

3096
02:20:17,390 --> 02:20:18,350
Hell yeah.
You're like a superman.

3097
02:20:18,380 --> 02:20:19,610
Oh,
I'm like a normal person.

3098
02:20:19,640 --> 02:20:21,530
No you're not.
No one's got the issues pal.

3099
02:20:21,590 --> 02:20:22,670
Yeah,
I got issues.

3100
02:20:22,980 --> 02:20:26,030
That's normal people.
Normal.

3101
02:20:26,400 --> 02:20:29,000
Someone that's mastering their issues.
This stuff's good for you.

3102
02:20:29,090 --> 02:20:33,140
I know it's good for you.
I'm going to crash my car if I a contact

3103
02:20:33,141 --> 02:20:35,570
high over here.
You want it just a little tiny hit?

3104
02:20:36,240 --> 02:20:37,350
No.
Alright.

3105
02:20:37,580 --> 02:20:39,680
What about your kids seeing you?
Smoking?

3106
02:20:39,780 --> 02:20:42,200
Didn't align.
What will they keep offline?

3107
02:20:42,980 --> 02:20:44,560
How old do they will?
They will though.

3108
02:20:44,640 --> 02:20:48,250
The youngest ones are seven and five.
They're online and they see me smoking.

3109
02:20:48,290 --> 02:20:50,240
We've got a real problem.
Two more years.

3110
02:20:50,450 --> 02:20:55,450
Two more years.
I'll be 24 months to come up with an 

3111
02:20:55,450 --> 02:20:55,450
excuse.

3112
02:20:55,450 --> 02:20:55,450
They're going to go back.
Once they hit you too,

3113
02:20:55,450 --> 02:20:57,350
they're just going to go through the 
files and I'll go.

3114
02:20:57,710 --> 02:21:00,170
That's what a dad does.
She is nice house we live in.

3115
02:21:00,260 --> 02:21:05,260
Yeah.
Daddy made this when he was high on 

3116
02:21:05,260 --> 02:21:05,660
marijuana.
Marijuana is not bad for you.

3117
02:21:06,050 --> 02:21:08,060
I don't think it's bad for you.
Isn't bad.

3118
02:21:08,120 --> 02:21:09,680
It's bad for a kid though.
Yes.

3119
02:21:09,681 --> 02:21:11,390
If you don't want your kids do those 
wine.

3120
02:21:11,391 --> 02:21:13,340
I drink wine in front of my children.
True.

3121
02:21:13,400 --> 02:21:18,400
I go to a restaurant and I have a couple
of glasses of wine in front of my 

3122
02:21:18,400 --> 02:21:19,700
children and I don't have any problem 
with it.

3123
02:21:19,790 --> 02:21:22,240
I've let them taste it.
Latino men,

3124
02:21:22,300 --> 02:21:27,300
they put it in their mouth like,
but wine is alcohol and you could drink 

3125
02:21:28,851 --> 02:21:31,700
yourself to death.
You drink yourself to death off of wine.

3126
02:21:31,701 --> 02:21:33,410
People have done it before.
It smells so good.

3127
02:21:33,590 --> 02:21:38,590
Smells great over there.
But um,

3128
02:21:39,140 --> 02:21:40,820
there's nothing wrong with it man.
It's bullshit.

3129
02:21:40,850 --> 02:21:41,420
No,
I know.

3130
02:21:41,780 --> 02:21:44,060
I was just in Hawaii and it was just so 
like,

3131
02:21:44,090 --> 02:21:45,020
Eh,
uh,

3132
02:21:45,100 --> 02:21:46,280
on.
Especially when you're in Hawaii,

3133
02:21:46,320 --> 02:21:47,800
just made for it.
Oh,

3134
02:21:48,110 --> 02:21:50,780
good Lord.
It's just so perfect.

3135
02:21:50,840 --> 02:21:53,270
Hawaii has a meth problem.
No.

3136
02:21:53,660 --> 02:21:55,190
Yeah.
A lot of poverty.

3137
02:21:55,820 --> 02:21:56,420
Well,
yeah.

3138
02:21:56,600 --> 02:21:58,750
Well,
I know there's parts of it that are just

3139
02:21:58,760 --> 02:21:59,810
a regular place.
Yup.

3140
02:22:00,150 --> 02:22:05,150
That's.
But that drives me crazy because I'm 

3141
02:22:05,150 --> 02:22:05,150
like,
oh my God,

3142
02:22:05,150 --> 02:22:07,870
you live in arguably the greatest spot 
on earth and somehow or another people 

3143
02:22:07,870 --> 02:22:09,010
get hooked on meth there.
I know in her,

3144
02:22:09,020 --> 02:22:13,310
in a horrible strip mall and a sad it is
paradise there though.

3145
02:22:13,370 --> 02:22:15,500
Fuck you do it right and stay in the 
right places.

3146
02:22:15,660 --> 02:22:20,660
Yeah.
The people are great to have a very 

3147
02:22:20,660 --> 02:22:21,170
relaxed attitude about life.
It's magical.

3148
02:22:21,790 --> 02:22:26,790
Literally.
I mean you're just sitting there and in 

3149
02:22:26,790 --> 02:22:29,891
the of the ocean,
the middle of the ocean and this little 

3150
02:22:29,891 --> 02:22:32,901
island and all these other human beings,
some whatever their reason have joined 

3151
02:22:32,901 --> 02:22:35,160
you on this island and there's this 
giant whale with.

3152
02:22:35,160 --> 02:22:38,570
It's a baby whale,
just dancing right next.

3153
02:22:38,590 --> 02:22:42,030
You go under the water,
you hear them singing stars.

3154
02:22:42,060 --> 02:22:43,350
It's just.
Yeah,

3155
02:22:43,380 --> 02:22:47,130
we were there with wild masons and we 
were on this tour where you,

3156
02:22:47,131 --> 02:22:48,810
uh,
you put on like,

3157
02:22:48,910 --> 02:22:52,050
um,
snorkel gear and then they find the pods

3158
02:22:52,110 --> 02:22:53,580
and you,
you,

3159
02:22:53,630 --> 02:22:58,630
they pull the boat within maybe 50 yards
of the pod and then you dive in the 

3160
02:22:58,630 --> 02:23:00,240
water and swim over to the pods of 
dolphins.

3161
02:23:00,241 --> 02:23:05,241
Now is amazing chefs.
But Hawaii has got a lot of fucking 

3162
02:23:05,241 --> 02:23:05,700
shark attacks,
man.

3163
02:23:05,730 --> 02:23:08,310
They do.
I literally was like,

3164
02:23:08,311 --> 02:23:10,740
why aren't there more shark attacks?
And when I got home I looked it up.

3165
02:23:11,040 --> 02:23:13,320
There's a lot of sharks.
While we were there.

3166
02:23:13,350 --> 02:23:14,350
Somebody's got,
get hold.

3167
02:23:14,450 --> 02:23:15,930
No.
While we were there,

3168
02:23:15,990 --> 02:23:20,160
a woman from Germany got fucking marked 
by a shark just swimming,

3169
02:23:20,190 --> 02:23:21,060
snorkeling.
Well,

3170
02:23:21,061 --> 02:23:22,290
we've been there three times.

3171
02:23:22,290 --> 02:23:26,490
When people got jacked by sharks,
a woman got killed and then another dude

3172
02:23:26,491 --> 02:23:31,491
got his leg essentially ripped off.
He was a local Hawaiian Kid who was 

3173
02:23:31,491 --> 02:23:33,570
surfing and that was on the big island.
He Got Jack.

3174
02:23:33,571 --> 02:23:35,730
There was another time we were there.
I was watching the news and you know,

3175
02:23:36,180 --> 02:23:41,180
were out there in the water,
fucking calm as can be snorkeling and 

3176
02:23:41,180 --> 02:23:41,690
having a good old time.
It's uh,

3177
02:23:42,070 --> 02:23:43,860
it's nerve wracking.
That's scary.

3178
02:23:43,861 --> 02:23:48,861
I'm glad I didn't know that when it was 
out there trying to look for sea 

3179
02:23:48,861 --> 02:23:48,861
turtles.
Yeah.

3180
02:23:48,861 --> 02:23:52,370
Two Thousand Fifteen was apparently the 
biggest year ever recorded for shark 

3181
02:23:52,370 --> 02:23:52,980
attacks.
What's the change?

3182
02:23:53,310 --> 02:23:58,310
Climate Change?
A really water's getting warmer and 

3183
02:23:58,310 --> 02:23:59,580
they're just hanging the less food or 
add.

3184
02:24:00,180 --> 02:24:02,250
They're mad.
They're mad at people for fucking up the

3185
02:24:02,251 --> 02:24:03,870
water.
He know the people are to blame.

3186
02:24:04,080 --> 02:24:07,680
I don't know what the reason is,
but I saw that recently,

3187
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:13,000
like it was a headline of one of the 
news stories over the last couple of 

3188
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:13,000
days.

3189
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:13,470
The other thing that happens a lot in 
Hawaii,

3190
02:24:13,500 --> 02:24:15,810
helicopter crashes.
They're not that infrequent.

3191
02:24:16,530 --> 02:24:18,450
Those tourist helicopters flipping 
around.

3192
02:24:18,510 --> 02:24:20,610
Oh really?
It's a good list.

3193
02:24:21,090 --> 02:24:21,990
Really?
Yeah,

3194
02:24:22,050 --> 02:24:24,750
Dude.
I've been on those things out there.

3195
02:24:24,780 --> 02:24:27,130
You shouldn't tell you fuck with me 
after I a lot.

3196
02:24:27,300 --> 02:24:28,890
Well,
you ruined my tesla experience.

3197
02:24:28,891 --> 02:24:33,891
Now I think someone's going to send me 
into a record number of shark attacks in

3198
02:24:35,371 --> 02:24:38,220
2015 though.
Only six deaths.

3199
02:24:38,840 --> 02:24:43,840
Well,
imagine if the wolf man only killed six 

3200
02:24:43,840 --> 02:24:43,840
people last year.
People like,

3201
02:24:43,840 --> 02:24:44,400
Oh,
it's fun to go outside with full moon.

3202
02:24:44,710 --> 02:24:49,710
Just get out in the woods.
It's not that man will then mostly eat 

3203
02:24:49,710 --> 02:24:50,340
deer.
Yeah.

3204
02:24:51,310 --> 02:24:54,510
The wolf was the number of attacks.
So if there's six deaths,

3205
02:24:54,511 --> 02:24:59,511
how many attacks were there?
90 eight and 98 in one year.

3206
02:25:00,110 --> 02:25:00,930
Yep.
Ninety eight.

3207
02:25:01,290 --> 02:25:02,940
Twenty zero.
Say Twenty eight,

3208
02:25:03,210 --> 02:25:04,830
26.
March 26 more.

3209
02:25:05,040 --> 02:25:06,660
Oh my God.
Jesus Christ.

3210
02:25:06,661 --> 02:25:11,661
In the previous year,
the number of shark attacks worldwide 

3211
02:25:11,661 --> 02:25:14,061
with 98 incidents,
a whopping 26 more than the previous 

3212
02:25:14,061 --> 02:25:14,061
year.
Wait,

3213
02:25:14,061 --> 02:25:17,310
and that's way more than a decade prior.
That's not Hawaii though.

3214
02:25:17,340 --> 02:25:19,560
That's international is an 
international.

3215
02:25:19,590 --> 02:25:22,950
So it say that worldwide was not that 
bad.

3216
02:25:22,951 --> 02:25:24,040
If you think about it worldwide.

3217
02:25:24,820 --> 02:25:29,820
So the wolf man,
if it was only like a few wolfman out 

3218
02:25:29,820 --> 02:25:30,240
there worldwide,
even like kids,

3219
02:25:30,250 --> 02:25:35,250
a full moon,
but it's a nice full moon will go out 

3220
02:25:35,250 --> 02:25:38,430
well here.
The twig snap will know the Werewolf is 

3221
02:25:38,430 --> 02:25:39,790
not stealthy.
They howl,

3222
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:43,810
they're assholes or they're scared of 
silver.

3223
02:25:43,930 --> 02:25:48,930
We're fine.
I don't have to go in the ocean by the 

3224
02:25:48,930 --> 02:25:50,941
way.
I can go to Hawaii and sit on a beach 

3225
02:25:50,941 --> 02:25:50,941
happy.
I don't have to go.

3226
02:25:51,220 --> 02:25:51,890
Don't,
don't.

3227
02:25:52,180 --> 02:25:55,210
I'm not water stuff now.
I used to as a kid,

3228
02:25:55,690 --> 02:25:57,940
man.
Fishing in Hawaii is amazing.

3229
02:25:58,260 --> 02:26:03,260
Yeah.
Catching a fish and they bring it back 

3230
02:26:03,260 --> 02:26:03,260
to the restaurant and they'll cook it 
for you.

3231
02:26:03,260 --> 02:26:05,280
Most hotels,
like they'll have like a chef that have.

3232
02:26:05,290 --> 02:26:07,420
You asked them if you go on a fishing 
trip,

3233
02:26:07,421 --> 02:26:09,670
if you organize it,
left a lot of them through the hotel.

3234
02:26:09,671 --> 02:26:11,340
You organize it out on a boat,
you know,

3235
02:26:11,341 --> 02:26:16,341
they,
they have like the little brochures 

3236
02:26:16,341 --> 02:26:16,341
like,
Hey,

3237
02:26:16,341 --> 02:26:16,341
this guy,
I'll take you out for this kind of fish.

3238
02:26:16,341 --> 02:26:20,910
And so last time we went out we call a,
it's called the who called.

3239
02:26:21,700 --> 02:26:24,970
So delicious man.
And the chef prepared it three different

3240
02:26:24,971 --> 02:26:26,470
ways.
He grilled it,

3241
02:26:26,620 --> 02:26:28,960
he baked it,
and he served it as Sashimi.

3242
02:26:29,070 --> 02:26:34,070
Oh No,
four different ways because he made a 

3243
02:26:34,070 --> 02:26:37,040
severe j to Oh my God.
Two hours old,

3244
02:26:37,630 --> 02:26:41,680
she's had severe ha like that,
a Costa Rica.

3245
02:26:41,681 --> 02:26:44,930
We came back and the guy just like,
they're like with all the,

3246
02:26:45,160 --> 02:26:50,160
you can just kinda lime jurors the hose 
and he's just like chopping up avocado 

3247
02:26:50,160 --> 02:26:53,730
or having so best thing you've ever 
eaten so much.

3248
02:26:54,050 --> 02:26:57,460
Fish is one of those things where it 
tastes so much better when it's fresh.

3249
02:26:57,490 --> 02:27:02,490
Completely the opposite with meat,
like meat actually tastes better when it

3250
02:27:02,561 --> 02:27:05,170
sits for a while.
That's why we buy dry aged meat.

3251
02:27:05,200 --> 02:27:08,140
Yeah.
Like sit in the steak house.

3252
02:27:08,141 --> 02:27:12,070
I'm just on a shelf for six months and 
you're like 35 degrees.

3253
02:27:12,080 --> 02:27:17,080
They can do that.
So it develops this sort of crust of 

3254
02:27:17,080 --> 02:27:19,381
bacteria on the outside.
Thirty five degrees if you've ever been 

3255
02:27:19,381 --> 02:27:22,771
to.
I'm like a butcher shop and seeing dry 

3256
02:27:22,771 --> 02:27:23,170
aged meat,
it will query you often meet for awhile.

3257
02:27:23,190 --> 02:27:27,700
You believe screen,
by the way,

3258
02:27:27,730 --> 02:27:31,210
queer you is not homophobic at all.
It was a perfect,

3259
02:27:31,270 --> 02:27:34,360
perfectly reasonable word to use in the 
dictionary.

3260
02:27:34,361 --> 02:27:37,960
It's perfectly reasonable way to use it,
a loophole,

3261
02:27:38,380 --> 02:27:40,810
but um,
it looks rotten and black.

3262
02:27:40,811 --> 02:27:42,850
It looks like mold and they'll really 
looks.

3263
02:27:42,851 --> 02:27:45,550
Yeah,
because the mold grows on the outside of

3264
02:27:45,551 --> 02:27:50,551
the meat and that's what's happening.
It's like bacteria is destroying the 

3265
02:27:50,551 --> 02:27:51,730
outside of the meat and you cut that 
away and what's underneath?

3266
02:27:51,731 --> 02:27:54,460
It's just tender and relaxed and 
delicious.

3267
02:27:54,510 --> 02:27:59,470
It sounds like my neck after maybe you 
need to eat mold on your neck.

3268
02:27:59,860 --> 02:28:03,070
Have you ever gone to Africa?
No,

3269
02:28:03,190 --> 02:28:08,110
I'm going in July,
Papa.

3270
02:28:08,200 --> 02:28:09,730
Boom,
buy a pop up.

3271
02:28:10,180 --> 02:28:15,180
I know a guy who knows a guy.
No,

3272
02:28:17,150 --> 02:28:20,770
it's a guy I worked for though,
who's a very.

3273
02:28:21,770 --> 02:28:22,070
And

3274
02:28:22,070 --> 02:28:27,070
uh,
I did a show for them and they are 

3275
02:28:27,070 --> 02:28:29,621
singing my.
I just had to fly myself there with my 

3276
02:28:29,621 --> 02:28:33,430
family and they're putting it.
There's these luxury resorts in these 

3277
02:28:33,430 --> 02:28:33,430
national reserves

3278
02:28:33,430 --> 02:28:34,480
in Tanzania.
Oh whoa.

3279
02:28:34,840 --> 02:28:37,180
For 10 days.
So you're going to be surrounded by like

3280
02:28:37,181 --> 02:28:38,120
lions and shit?
Yeah.

3281
02:28:38,230 --> 02:28:38,860
Oh,
Tom.

3282
02:28:38,861 --> 02:28:40,450
Papa,
please don't die.

3283
02:28:40,480 --> 02:28:45,480
Yes.
A lot of guys with guns that will stand 

3284
02:28:45,480 --> 02:28:49,051
around you.
Do you know about the woman who was the 

3285
02:28:49,051 --> 02:28:49,051
editor?
A film editor,

3286
02:28:49,051 --> 02:28:49,330
a video editor from game of thrones?
No.

3287
02:28:49,360 --> 02:28:51,490
She got pulled out of her car by a lion 
and killed.

3288
02:28:51,520 --> 02:28:53,170
She did.
Was she doing?

3289
02:28:53,230 --> 02:28:56,410
She was taking photographs and she 
rolled down the window,

3290
02:28:56,770 --> 02:29:01,770
take a better picture,
and the lion grabbed her and pulled her 

3291
02:29:01,770 --> 02:29:01,770
out of the car and killed her in front 
of everybody.

3292
02:29:01,770 --> 02:29:02,920
Well,
nothing they could do about it.

3293
02:29:02,960 --> 02:29:07,960
That's not going to happen to us because
we're not going to have windows,

3294
02:29:09,730 --> 02:29:12,590
won't make eye contact.
They're open and no cameras.

3295
02:29:12,591 --> 02:29:14,420
And um,
it'd be armed to the tits.

3296
02:29:14,450 --> 02:29:15,590
I'll be honest with you.
I don't know.

3297
02:29:15,650 --> 02:29:17,510
I never had like a burning desire,
you know,

3298
02:29:17,511 --> 02:29:22,511
some places you want to get to,
like I want it to be in Italy or you 

3299
02:29:22,511 --> 02:29:22,511
know,
I had no,

3300
02:29:22,511 --> 02:29:25,460
nothing in my soul was like Africa,
we must do Africa.

3301
02:29:25,461 --> 02:29:29,900
But South fraternity came up and it 
seems pretty amazing and I feel like the

3302
02:29:29,901 --> 02:29:31,790
closer I get,
the more amped I'm getting about it.

3303
02:29:32,630 --> 02:29:34,790
But uh,
he was like,

3304
02:29:34,791 --> 02:29:36,650
I'm telling you,
it will change your life.

3305
02:29:36,680 --> 02:29:40,280
You'll just see this planet differently.
Once you go to Africa,

3306
02:29:40,670 --> 02:29:42,310
Africa,
you would like Africa.

3307
02:29:42,420 --> 02:29:42,460
I

3308
02:29:42,490 --> 02:29:45,420
thing I wouldn't like malaria.
So I'll watch DVD,

3309
02:29:47,940 --> 02:29:52,620
fuck you and fuck the Zika virus.
I could see you in Africa.

3310
02:29:53,490 --> 02:29:54,720
You're adventurous.
Yes,

3311
02:29:54,721 --> 02:29:55,780
I would go.
But um,

3312
02:29:56,210 --> 02:29:58,260
I would definitely be worried about 
malaria.

3313
02:29:58,400 --> 02:30:03,400
Oh,
I'm worried about a lot of things for 

3314
02:30:03,400 --> 02:30:03,400
sure.
But I am fat.

3315
02:30:03,400 --> 02:30:04,410
I'm a big fan of wildlife.
I'm fascinated by the wildlife there.

3316
02:30:04,411 --> 02:30:09,411
Although the reality of these parks is 
almost artificial and a lot of ways how 

3317
02:30:12,390 --> 02:30:15,360
they maintain everything and they,
they're doing it for,

3318
02:30:15,630 --> 02:30:18,110
for tourist money.
Like there's almost,

3319
02:30:19,050 --> 02:30:21,510
there's almost an artificial quality to 
it because,

3320
02:30:22,230 --> 02:30:27,230
you know,
a lot of these places are fenced in and 

3321
02:30:27,230 --> 02:30:27,620
so even though it's thousands and 
thousands of acres like this,

3322
02:30:27,880 --> 02:30:30,660
it's some,
it's not quite fucked up.

3323
02:30:30,690 --> 02:30:32,360
It's not quite as zoo.
No,

3324
02:30:32,500 --> 02:30:33,200
no,
no,

3325
02:30:33,201 --> 02:30:34,410
no,
not at all.

3326
02:30:34,411 --> 02:30:36,750
And they're still migrating and there's 
still all that stuff.

3327
02:30:37,020 --> 02:30:38,100
They're not feeding him.
No,

3328
02:30:38,101 --> 02:30:38,490
no,
no,

3329
02:30:38,491 --> 02:30:38,880
no,
no.

3330
02:30:38,910 --> 02:30:42,290
So it's still live and wild,
but it's like going into Yosemite.

3331
02:30:42,860 --> 02:30:44,400
He used to people,
man,

3332
02:30:44,820 --> 02:30:45,990
I hope so.
They do.

3333
02:30:46,050 --> 02:30:47,630
They get used to people.
And you're in these.

3334
02:30:47,640 --> 02:30:52,640
A lot of times you're in these open air 
jeeps and we were talking about it on 

3335
02:30:52,640 --> 02:30:53,070
the podcast.
I was saying like,

3336
02:30:53,090 --> 02:30:58,090
how?
How come these fucking animals don't 

3337
02:30:58,090 --> 02:30:59,781
jump in there and almost as if on cue 
after we said that a leopard jumped in a

3338
02:30:59,851 --> 02:31:02,100
jeep,
an open air jeep like a week later,

3339
02:31:02,101 --> 02:31:02,970
and I was like,
yeah,

3340
02:31:03,330 --> 02:31:05,160
why isn't that fucking happening every 
day?

3341
02:31:06,160 --> 02:31:09,510
But I'm.
I wonder what if animals like lions just

3342
02:31:09,511 --> 02:31:12,480
start figuring that out the same way 
keynote there's been,

3343
02:31:12,510 --> 02:31:15,330
there was an article recently,
they were talking about chimps that they

3344
02:31:15,331 --> 02:31:20,331
believe chimps have just started to 
enter the stone age for the of 

3345
02:31:20,331 --> 02:31:20,820
chimpanzee intelligence.

3346
02:31:20,820 --> 02:31:25,820
Like they literally might be evolving 
before our eyes and they started to use 

3347
02:31:25,820 --> 02:31:28,830
tools on a regular basis.
This observed champion.

3348
02:31:28,980 --> 02:31:29,910
Yeah,
they're coming.

3349
02:31:30,300 --> 02:31:32,280
Wow.
Might take a few million years,

3350
02:31:32,281 --> 02:31:37,281
but yeah,
if human beings have only been in this 

3351
02:31:37,281 --> 02:31:39,771
form where they think for the last like 
200 plus thousand years essentially 

3352
02:31:39,771 --> 02:31:42,750
unrecognizable from Uri.
Like what the fuck?

3353
02:31:43,050 --> 02:31:45,360
What's the chimp going to be like in a 
million years?

3354
02:31:45,480 --> 02:31:47,190
Awesome.
My Bay.

3355
02:31:47,940 --> 02:31:52,940
Right.
They might be like some crazy sasquatch 

3356
02:31:52,940 --> 02:31:54,600
type thing,
some almost half human half monkey thing

3357
02:31:54,601 --> 02:31:59,601
running through the woods and we'll just
be like jelly fish with cars that drive 

3358
02:31:59,601 --> 02:32:02,841
itself.
Prime rib eye balls in much.

3359
02:32:07,140 --> 02:32:09,210
Our cars never crashed,
so we make them out of paper.

3360
02:32:09,850 --> 02:32:12,890
That was logic is everyone's driving a 
paper car.

3361
02:32:12,920 --> 02:32:17,610
No one's going to get hurt.
So knowing that that amount of tax.

3362
02:32:17,910 --> 02:32:19,830
I posted this the other day on 
Instagram,

3363
02:32:19,831 --> 02:32:23,070
but just chimps testicle in relationship
to the size of his brain.

3364
02:32:23,400 --> 02:32:28,260
It's testicle is literally about 70 to 
80 percent of the size of its brain.

3365
02:32:28,560 --> 02:32:30,270
Oh my God,
I got a fair amount.

3366
02:32:30,940 --> 02:32:35,940
70.
Think 70 is accurate at something like 

3367
02:32:35,940 --> 02:32:35,940
that.
It's made wrong.

3368
02:32:35,940 --> 02:32:37,770
Yeah.
What is balls?

3369
02:32:37,860 --> 02:32:40,260
One ball is 70 percent the size of the 
brain.

3370
02:32:40,440 --> 02:32:44,100
Two balls.
Balls are almost a whole.

3371
02:32:44,101 --> 02:32:46,480
Brain is weird,
right?

3372
02:32:47,460 --> 02:32:49,290
Poor guys.
It's so big.

3373
02:32:49,680 --> 02:32:51,270
You know what?
The ball's in front of us.

3374
02:32:51,300 --> 02:32:53,340
This is a little perspective trick.
Yeah,

3375
02:32:53,341 --> 02:32:55,410
true.
Because that guy's hands.

3376
02:32:55,411 --> 02:33:00,411
That's not one above the other.
It's one behind the other and the other 

3377
02:33:00,411 --> 02:33:01,140
hand looks bigger and blacker.
It's a different guy,

3378
02:33:01,170 --> 02:33:03,530
different guy.
These flocks.

3379
02:33:04,210 --> 02:33:09,210
Yeah.
Maybe if they got it right up next to 

3380
02:33:09,210 --> 02:33:09,210
it,
we don't want to go 40 percent.

3381
02:33:09,210 --> 02:33:09,840
Either way.
It's a giant ball.

3382
02:33:09,841 --> 02:33:11,280
I'd be very proud of that.
Testicle,

3383
02:33:12,260 --> 02:33:13,710
testicle like that.
Show everybody.

3384
02:33:13,740 --> 02:33:15,570
So knowing that there's that many shark 
attacks,

3385
02:33:15,571 --> 02:33:17,940
will you not go snorkel next time you 
go?

3386
02:33:18,600 --> 02:33:21,030
Um,
I'll tell you what.

3387
02:33:21,031 --> 02:33:24,630
I was thinking about going to Paris this
year and I'm not going to Paris.

3388
02:33:24,720 --> 02:33:26,070
You're not.
Nah,

3389
02:33:26,310 --> 02:33:28,140
I'm good.
My parents made that call to.

3390
02:33:28,230 --> 02:33:31,200
Yeah,
I think that's the right call for me for

3391
02:33:31,201 --> 02:33:36,201
now.
You have some giant ass fucking crazy 

3392
02:33:36,201 --> 02:33:37,140
terrorist attack like that and you 
haven't heard any issues with immigrants

3393
02:33:37,141 --> 02:33:39,300
and all the craziness that's going on 
there.

3394
02:33:39,310 --> 02:33:40,250
Like they,
you know,

3395
02:33:40,260 --> 02:33:42,270
they might've let some bad people in the
country,

3396
02:33:42,390 --> 02:33:45,690
they let some great people that were 
trying to escape a terrible place,

3397
02:33:45,691 --> 02:33:47,550
but they also might have let some bad 
people into.

3398
02:33:47,940 --> 02:33:50,730
And there's a lot of fucking anti Jewish
sentiment.

3399
02:33:50,731 --> 02:33:55,731
Although I'm not Jewish.
I know video of these people walking 

3400
02:33:55,731 --> 02:33:59,460
through these Arab neighborhoods and 
Paris and the fucking rampant,

3401
02:33:59,730 --> 02:34:03,210
brutal,
like outright antisemitism,

3402
02:34:03,270 --> 02:34:04,380
yelling it out.
These people.

3403
02:34:04,490 --> 02:34:07,230
Really?
That's not America.

3404
02:34:07,890 --> 02:34:08,660
I think you know,
we're.

3405
02:34:08,690 --> 02:34:09,840
We're,
you're dealing with.

3406
02:34:10,030 --> 02:34:13,050
It's a very tricky place right now.
Now.

3407
02:34:13,110 --> 02:34:15,390
It's such a shame.
It's a really beautiful.

3408
02:34:15,410 --> 02:34:16,620
I know.
Stunning.

3409
02:34:16,800 --> 02:34:18,280
So historically

3410
02:34:18,400 --> 02:34:22,180
with any update on the war,
they declared war on Isis.

3411
02:34:22,360 --> 02:34:24,580
Isis.
Has it gotten even that man?

3412
02:34:24,581 --> 02:34:25,150
I mean,
what?

3413
02:34:25,180 --> 02:34:27,520
What happened over there?
I don't even understand what happened.

3414
02:34:27,521 --> 02:34:32,521
It's when,
when you have a group of people and 

3415
02:34:32,521 --> 02:34:32,521
those people that wanted to performing 
that terrorist act,

3416
02:34:32,521 --> 02:34:33,880
wind up dying like,
boy,

3417
02:34:34,240 --> 02:34:39,240
try getting the truth out of all that.
Trying to figure out what their motives 

3418
02:34:39,240 --> 02:34:40,180
were,
what like the San Bernardino people.

3419
02:34:40,960 --> 02:34:43,570
Try figuring that out after the fact.
Trying to figure that out.

3420
02:34:43,660 --> 02:34:48,660
I'm not going to San Bernardino either.
Dropping your kids off and it's not 

3421
02:34:48,660 --> 02:34:48,660
true.
San Bernardino.

3422
02:34:48,660 --> 02:34:52,860
That's how a hypocrite I am.
I won't go to Paris to go to San 

3423
02:34:52,860 --> 02:34:56,540
Bernardino.
Bet you go to Paris if someone gave you 

3424
02:34:56,540 --> 02:34:56,540
a sweet gig there.
No,

3425
02:34:56,540 --> 02:34:56,540
no,
no,

3426
02:34:56,540 --> 02:34:57,760
no,
no,

3427
02:34:57,990 --> 02:35:01,180
I don't think so.
That's a brutal flight to man a Gig.

3428
02:35:01,390 --> 02:35:06,390
Eight is I would way rather go there and
just vegetate and not have any 

3429
02:35:06,390 --> 02:35:06,480
responsibility.

3430
02:35:06,690 --> 02:35:11,690
Then you go there for.
That's one thing that I've really 

3431
02:35:11,690 --> 02:35:13,980
enjoyed about traveling is that I've.
I've gotten a chance to see some really 

3432
02:35:13,980 --> 02:35:15,610
cool places like England,
Ireland,

3433
02:35:15,850 --> 02:35:18,670
but one of the things that's an issue is
every time I've gone I've been working.

3434
02:35:18,790 --> 02:35:23,790
Yeah,
just don't have a chance to see that 

3435
02:35:23,790 --> 02:35:26,761
much now.
I went to Italy for the first time and 

3436
02:35:26,761 --> 02:35:27,340
no Gig at all and I don't travel like 
that either.

3437
02:35:27,341 --> 02:35:28,030
You know?
Normally.

3438
02:35:28,580 --> 02:35:31,210
And what a difference.
Oh yeah,

3439
02:35:31,420 --> 02:35:32,920
what a difference.
But man,

3440
02:35:32,980 --> 02:35:34,010
we,
you know,

3441
02:35:34,011 --> 02:35:39,011
like I don't know how you are,
but see if I fly to Chicago and I got a 

3442
02:35:39,011 --> 02:35:42,751
Gig tomorrow night in Chicago,
I'm going to get something to eat and 

3443
02:35:42,751 --> 02:35:43,720
I'm gonna go to the gym and I'm going to
go over my notes.

3444
02:35:43,750 --> 02:35:45,100
Right?
I'm not going anywhere.

3445
02:35:45,130 --> 02:35:46,790
No I can't.
No.

3446
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:48,600
People are like,
Yo,

3447
02:35:48,610 --> 02:35:49,540
don't you go sightseeing.

3448
02:35:49,630 --> 02:35:54,630
They don't realize that everything you 
do during that day takes away from the 

3449
02:35:54,630 --> 02:35:54,630
show.
Yeah.

3450
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:58,000
There's just an energy,
mental and physical energy that does not

3451
02:35:58,001 --> 02:36:01,180
end up in the show unless it's something
that's going to enhance the show.

3452
02:36:01,210 --> 02:36:06,210
Like going over your notes like that,
sitting there but not running around 

3453
02:36:06,210 --> 02:36:06,210
town.
Getting cabs do,

3454
02:36:06,250 --> 02:36:11,250
talking to waiters,
sometimes a little bit of activity and 

3455
02:36:11,250 --> 02:36:12,360
sightseeing can amp you up,
you know,

3456
02:36:12,430 --> 02:36:16,060
little you have to have the time to do 
it and it can't be taken away from.

3457
02:36:16,061 --> 02:36:18,700
Like for me,
exercise is mandatory.

3458
02:36:18,701 --> 02:36:20,350
Yeah.
Like if I go on the road,

3459
02:36:20,440 --> 02:36:25,440
one of the most important things for me 
is almost immediately I have to 

3460
02:36:25,440 --> 02:36:25,440
exercise.
Really?

3461
02:36:25,440 --> 02:36:30,060
Yeah.
Because if I don't then I'm going to be 

3462
02:36:30,060 --> 02:36:30,060
tired,
but I'll get there and I'm like,

3463
02:36:30,060 --> 02:36:30,190
oh,
fucking flying.

3464
02:36:30,250 --> 02:36:32,770
Oh Bullshit.
But what you gotta do is say,

3465
02:36:32,771 --> 02:36:33,820
shut up pussy.

3466
02:36:34,030 --> 02:36:36,280
Just put your fucking shorts on and 
let's do this.

3467
02:36:36,281 --> 02:36:37,780
What floors Jim on.
Thank you.

3468
02:36:37,860 --> 02:36:40,750
Here we go.
Get on the fucking machine and just go.

3469
02:36:40,751 --> 02:36:45,751
Just go or a routine,
whatever I'm doing whatever weight 

3470
02:36:45,751 --> 02:36:46,180
lifting routine.
I just fucking make sure I do it.

3471
02:36:46,181 --> 02:36:48,370
I don't want to do it,
but I actually had a boss.

3472
02:36:48,430 --> 02:36:50,020
I should do that more.
If you do that,

3473
02:36:50,021 --> 02:36:50,800
man,
I'm telling you,

3474
02:36:50,801 --> 02:36:55,801
just write it down so that it's not an 
option to deny like unless you're sick 

3475
02:36:55,801 --> 02:36:56,830
or something like that and then you 
definitely shouldn't work out.

3476
02:36:56,860 --> 02:36:58,300
Right.
But if you can do that,

3477
02:36:58,360 --> 02:37:03,360
just it's just,
it's 40 minutes that you would just be 

3478
02:37:03,360 --> 02:37:03,490
jerking off and reading email.
It's true.

3479
02:37:04,100 --> 02:37:09,100
Totally split.
That 40 minutes will go by and you're 

3480
02:37:09,100 --> 02:37:09,100
like,
fuck,

3481
02:37:09,100 --> 02:37:09,460
I missed the window.
I've done that before too.

3482
02:37:09,461 --> 02:37:11,620
I've definitely done that before.
You're tired.

3483
02:37:11,800 --> 02:37:13,240
Yes.
But when I,

3484
02:37:13,450 --> 02:37:16,010
when I say no,
I'm going to go down there and

3485
02:37:16,010 --> 02:37:17,420
I'm going to do you know,
whatever,

3486
02:37:17,421 --> 02:37:19,450
45 minutes on the elliptical machine.
Just go.

3487
02:37:19,490 --> 02:37:21,650
Just do it.
Listen to a podcast.

3488
02:37:21,651 --> 02:37:23,810
I'll put a podcast on.
Just forced myself.

3489
02:37:23,930 --> 02:37:25,180
Yeah.
I just,

3490
02:37:25,870 --> 02:37:29,450
I do a couple of yoga stretches.
That's good.

3491
02:37:29,510 --> 02:37:30,500
That'll help.
That is.

3492
02:37:30,510 --> 02:37:32,460
There's nothing now.
There's a couple of that are.

3493
02:37:33,100 --> 02:37:38,100
For me it showed strenuous exercise is 
really good for just resetting 

3494
02:37:39,011 --> 02:37:40,540
everything that your whole nervous 
system.

3495
02:37:41,230 --> 02:37:43,150
Do you ever do a yoga class when you go 
on the road?

3496
02:37:43,510 --> 02:37:44,170
Yeah,
I have.

3497
02:37:44,210 --> 02:37:44,980
Yeah.
Yeah.

3498
02:37:45,280 --> 02:37:49,030
I have for awhile when I was heavily 
more heavily into it,

3499
02:37:49,031 --> 02:37:50,320
I would,
it was Kinda cool.

3500
02:37:50,321 --> 02:37:53,620
You come into town and find where it was
and you know,

3501
02:37:54,340 --> 02:37:55,720
it was a cool little like,
okay,

3502
02:37:55,721 --> 02:37:58,350
that's the project I'm going to do that,
you know,

3503
02:37:58,540 --> 02:38:00,310
that's a good move.
Good move.

3504
02:38:00,520 --> 02:38:03,520
Something that you just have an outlet.
Yeah.

3505
02:38:03,760 --> 02:38:07,900
Little thing that sort of connects you 
to what Tom Papa does.

3506
02:38:08,320 --> 02:38:09,280
Right?
Exactly.

3507
02:38:09,390 --> 02:38:11,350
And then uh,
and then it's just the work,

3508
02:38:11,351 --> 02:38:16,351
it's just taking your notebook and 
taking your notes and going over last 

3509
02:38:16,351 --> 02:38:16,780
night going over the,
you know,

3510
02:38:16,781 --> 02:38:20,530
what I did for the first time this week,
I've listened to myself.

3511
02:38:20,590 --> 02:38:23,440
I haven't,
I haven't recorded myself in a while.

3512
02:38:23,620 --> 02:38:24,400
Really?
Yeah,

3513
02:38:24,401 --> 02:38:29,401
it was probably,
I always record but don't really listen 

3514
02:38:29,401 --> 02:38:33,151
to it unless I know I have to.
There was something I want to pick out 

3515
02:38:33,151 --> 02:38:37,830
and uh,
I listened to myself on a Sunday after 

3516
02:38:37,830 --> 02:38:38,440
the weekend and,
uh,

3517
02:38:38,860 --> 02:38:39,580
that was rough.

3518
02:38:44,100 --> 02:38:45,460
You forget,
you're like,

3519
02:38:45,490 --> 02:38:47,320
oh yeah,
I should be doing this all the time.

3520
02:38:47,321 --> 02:38:50,170
It's so valuable.
It's incredibly valuable.

3521
02:38:50,200 --> 02:38:52,150
Visually is even better.
I know.

3522
02:38:52,180 --> 02:38:53,980
You can watch a video of yourself and 
you go,

3523
02:38:53,981 --> 02:38:55,360
oh my God,
I look so gross.

3524
02:38:56,430 --> 02:38:57,910
I gotTa pee.
I gotta dress better.

3525
02:38:59,110 --> 02:39:02,320
My posture sucks.
Why does my ever move my right arm?

3526
02:39:02,350 --> 02:39:05,050
Why am I like a real thing?
I'm doing my hand in my pocket.

3527
02:39:05,080 --> 02:39:08,500
Get it out of your pocket at the Irvine 
Improv.

3528
02:39:08,501 --> 02:39:10,920
That guy he did every set and just hand 
them to me.

3529
02:39:11,070 --> 02:39:12,270
Those are great.
Oh,

3530
02:39:12,271 --> 02:39:13,840
nice house does that too.
I was like,

3531
02:39:13,841 --> 02:39:14,520
oh,
thanks.

3532
02:39:15,160 --> 02:39:18,520
Have you formed at the recent Irvine 
Improv?

3533
02:39:18,550 --> 02:39:19,320
The new one?
Yeah.

3534
02:39:19,930 --> 02:39:21,130
Nice.
Nice.

3535
02:39:21,160 --> 02:39:23,850
Really Nice theater.
Yeah,

3536
02:39:23,890 --> 02:39:25,990
Collin did his,
a comedy special.

3537
02:39:25,991 --> 02:39:27,850
They're really special there.
I was like,

3538
02:39:27,880 --> 02:39:28,910
that's a good call.
Yeah.

3539
02:39:28,980 --> 02:39:31,450
There's places as places hot.
Yeah.

3540
02:39:31,450 --> 02:39:33,510
It looked great.
The backstage was grieving greg.

3541
02:39:33,760 --> 02:39:36,070
It was a good spot.
That town,

3542
02:39:36,071 --> 02:39:41,071
like Irvine is a town where there's so 
many fucking people jammed into that 

3543
02:39:41,351 --> 02:39:42,490
area.
It's shocking,

3544
02:39:42,491 --> 02:39:46,090
isn't it?
It is one of the most populated areas in

3545
02:39:46,091 --> 02:39:51,091
southern California.
Why did you guys come from like me and 

3546
02:39:51,091 --> 02:39:54,121
my wife were talking about this the 
other day that there's such a big 

3547
02:39:54,121 --> 02:39:56,821
difference between driving up like we're
like thousand oaks is and driving down 

3548
02:39:57,401 --> 02:40:01,390
Orange County like thousand oaks.
Things lighten up considerably.

3549
02:40:01,391 --> 02:40:02,360
That's right.
You know,

3550
02:40:02,370 --> 02:40:04,300
it's like fucking horses.
You should up there,

3551
02:40:04,660 --> 02:40:07,630
but if you get down to like Laguna.
Yeah,

3552
02:40:07,660 --> 02:40:11,110
good luck.
Good luck getting there and time.

3553
02:40:11,170 --> 02:40:16,170
It's intense.
Do you ever do gigs in San Diego that 

3554
02:40:16,170 --> 02:40:19,941
drive?
You might as well just drive to the 

3555
02:40:19,941 --> 02:40:19,941
fucking ocean.
Let's see if your car can make it.

3556
02:40:19,941 --> 02:40:23,190
See if you could just drive on the edge 
of the water.

3557
02:40:23,220 --> 02:40:24,790
I take the train a lot.
Oh,

3558
02:40:24,990 --> 02:40:26,280
you ever do that?
No,

3559
02:40:26,281 --> 02:40:27,780
I've never done that,
but I was just thinking,

3560
02:40:27,810 --> 02:40:32,810
no wonder if you could drive in the 
ocean if they arrest you.

3561
02:40:32,941 --> 02:40:35,880
What are they actually in the ocean and 
you're driving your car.

3562
02:40:35,890 --> 02:40:37,980
They let you go.
What kind of car?

3563
02:40:38,250 --> 02:40:39,270
Well,
if you have one of those cars,

3564
02:40:39,280 --> 02:40:40,860
the snorkel,
that's what I'm thinking.

3565
02:40:41,220 --> 02:40:43,200
If you've got like one of them Toyota 
land cruisers,

3566
02:40:43,210 --> 02:40:48,210
they put a snorkel on them and they 
drive to the river and the fucking 

3567
02:40:48,210 --> 02:40:49,080
Amazon like you would think they'd let 
you go.

3568
02:40:50,100 --> 02:40:52,590
The sharks might get you.
Do they let you do that?

3569
02:40:52,740 --> 02:40:55,650
Like how does that work?
Like with the coastguard k fuck face,

3570
02:40:55,830 --> 02:40:59,160
you can't just drive in the ocean.
Probably not.

3571
02:40:59,170 --> 02:41:00,930
I thought about the same thing in a 
similar vein.

3572
02:41:00,931 --> 02:41:02,520
Can you just go on horseback down?

3573
02:41:02,520 --> 02:41:05,820
Ventura could just get a horse and go to
the bank that way.

3574
02:41:05,910 --> 02:41:07,650
That's very,
very good point.

3575
02:41:07,800 --> 02:41:12,800
Could you just tired horse up to the 
bike rack and walk inside and you cash a

3576
02:41:13,651 --> 02:41:14,340
check?
Well,

3577
02:41:14,341 --> 02:41:19,341
it's always weird if you go to burbank 
and you see people riding their horses 

3578
02:41:19,341 --> 02:41:19,341
around.
Burbank.

3579
02:41:19,341 --> 02:41:23,450
Burbank is an equestrian neighborhood.
My daughter was taking lessons over 

3580
02:41:23,450 --> 02:41:23,530
there for a little bit with the,
okay,

3581
02:41:23,630 --> 02:41:25,320
here's this Guy Perth,
Australia.

3582
02:41:25,560 --> 02:41:27,060
Oh,
that guy just drove right in.

3583
02:41:27,210 --> 02:41:29,400
I'm just driving in.
That's just stupid.

3584
02:41:29,880 --> 02:41:33,190
You can't do that.
Is this guy tried watchmen drive current

3585
02:41:33,200 --> 02:41:35,220
into the ocean?
The ocean from the cops I think.

3586
02:41:35,280 --> 02:41:36,240
Oh,
he's trying to get away from.

3587
02:41:36,780 --> 02:41:38,280
Okay,
well that's different.

3588
02:41:38,880 --> 02:41:43,880
And so now he's driving off and the cops
tried to get them so they drove right 

3589
02:41:43,880 --> 02:41:44,940
into the ocean.
This guy's an idiot.

3590
02:41:45,240 --> 02:41:46,080
See the car doesn't.

3591
02:41:46,250 --> 02:41:48,820
It doesn't end.
Once the hood is underwater.

3592
02:41:49,020 --> 02:41:51,690
Dip Shit for him.
That's what the snorkels for for it.

3593
02:41:51,720 --> 02:41:53,400
But the thing that the cops behind him 
like,

3594
02:41:53,460 --> 02:41:55,530
well he's going hop out of the car and 
just swim.

3595
02:41:55,560 --> 02:41:56,490
Yeah,
he's out now.

3596
02:41:56,790 --> 02:42:01,790
But the thing is if you,
if you have a car with a snorkel and he 

3597
02:42:01,790 --> 02:42:05,721
doesn't have a car with a snorkel,
you can drive pretty far and they can't 

3598
02:42:05,721 --> 02:42:06,960
get you.
Like you could stay up but he could just

3599
02:42:06,961 --> 02:42:10,320
drive next to you on the beach and 
eventually got to come to the land.

3600
02:42:10,620 --> 02:42:14,730
Look at this crazy clusterfuck of cops 
and the car.

3601
02:42:14,790 --> 02:42:17,170
Is this an Australia or something?
A course.

3602
02:42:17,530 --> 02:42:21,670
How did you say it?
At the beginning?

3603
02:42:21,690 --> 02:42:22,170
Yeah.
Okay.

3604
02:42:22,171 --> 02:42:23,820
That's it.
Because otherwise I'm like,

3605
02:42:23,880 --> 02:42:25,620
there's no way I just guessed,
but why not?

3606
02:42:25,621 --> 02:42:28,740
Just get a horse and code,
run your errands.

3607
02:42:28,740 --> 02:42:33,740
That.
How about an Eagle Eagle to fly around 

3608
02:42:33,740 --> 02:42:34,530
managing so many.
Just developed an like look,

3609
02:42:34,590 --> 02:42:39,590
grab onto his talents.
Have you ever seen a pit bull that's 

3610
02:42:39,590 --> 02:42:39,590
like 190 pounds?
Yeah.

3611
02:42:39,590 --> 02:42:40,020
They're not supposed to be that big.
Right?

3612
02:42:40,250 --> 02:42:44,010
Somebody made that.
They bred those pitbulls until it became

3613
02:42:44,011 --> 02:42:46,630
this ridiculous thing.
The average size for Pitbull,

3614
02:42:46,780 --> 02:42:49,230
those fighting dogs,
they're like 35 pounds.

3615
02:42:49,260 --> 02:42:50,490
I got big ones.
Like 50.

3616
02:42:50,520 --> 02:42:51,240
Really?
Yeah.

3617
02:42:51,250 --> 02:42:54,690
They're not big.
So these monsters are like chickens with

3618
02:42:54,691 --> 02:42:56,070
giant breasts,
sort of,

3619
02:42:56,610 --> 02:42:58,770
which also comes from selective 
breeding.

3620
02:42:59,040 --> 02:43:01,560
Apparently I thought the chickens with 
giant breasts were steroids,

3621
02:43:02,040 --> 02:43:03,990
but uh,
this chicken farmer explained to me,

3622
02:43:03,991 --> 02:43:04,980
you know,
because you know,

3623
02:43:04,981 --> 02:43:09,981
how much,
how expensive it would be really pumped 

3624
02:43:09,981 --> 02:43:09,981
with.
We have this idea,

3625
02:43:09,981 --> 02:43:11,410
oh,
they're putting all the hormones and not

3626
02:43:11,411 --> 02:43:12,250
really.
No,

3627
02:43:12,320 --> 02:43:13,120
no,
no,

3628
02:43:13,121 --> 02:43:13,480
they,
I mean,

3629
02:43:13,481 --> 02:43:14,290
they,
they would,

3630
02:43:14,470 --> 02:43:16,420
they would,
if they had to fix on something crazy.

3631
02:43:16,450 --> 02:43:17,590
But most of it is.
Yeah.

3632
02:43:17,591 --> 02:43:19,890
Most of it is they genetically engineer 
them.

3633
02:43:19,900 --> 02:43:22,360
These selectively breed them.
So they get,

3634
02:43:22,390 --> 02:43:25,660
they selectively breed them to the point
where they could barely even walk.

3635
02:43:25,930 --> 02:43:28,700
It's poor things that they can't stay on
their leg.

3636
02:43:28,701 --> 02:43:32,040
So for at least how this guy has 
explained it to her,

3637
02:43:32,200 --> 02:43:36,520
it's mostly just selective breeding.
And why can they do that with an eagle?

3638
02:43:37,300 --> 02:43:40,000
Get a big ass.
Big Ass fucking eagle.

3639
02:43:40,120 --> 02:43:42,280
Have you could teach an eagle to hunt 
for wolves for you.

3640
02:43:42,281 --> 02:43:43,600
Have you ever seen them do that?
No.

3641
02:43:43,660 --> 02:43:44,860
Yeah,
the Mongolians.

3642
02:43:44,920 --> 02:43:49,920
Oh really?
They lead an eagle loose in the eagle 

3643
02:43:49,920 --> 02:43:50,500
will fucking fly down and Jack a wolf,
a wolf,

3644
02:43:50,560 --> 02:43:52,180
a wolf.
Those are big.

3645
02:43:52,210 --> 02:43:55,990
They're not big enough.
That's how gangster eagles are.

3646
02:43:56,260 --> 02:43:57,550
I'm reading that book.
The Hawk.

3647
02:43:58,030 --> 02:43:59,870
What's that girl?
Uh,

3648
02:44:00,610 --> 02:44:01,870
just loved.
Um,

3649
02:44:01,920 --> 02:44:06,920
it's her autobiography basically he's 
just a writer out of Oxford and she is 

3650
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,310
learning how to uh,
train,

3651
02:44:09,311 --> 02:44:14,311
uh,
go shock and awe falcons and all that 

3652
02:44:14,311 --> 02:44:17,821
kind of stuff with the hoods and very 
intricate about that whole practice is 

3653
02:44:17,821 --> 02:44:18,100
pretty intense.

3654
02:44:18,160 --> 02:44:22,460
It's very intense getting into trust you
and they're in its hood.

3655
02:44:22,600 --> 02:44:24,610
You have to be with it all the time.
All the time,

3656
02:44:25,090 --> 02:44:26,890
like in the beginning,
like for days,

3657
02:44:27,580 --> 02:44:30,580
just sitting with it on your arm.
Can you go on vacations new?

3658
02:44:30,850 --> 02:44:32,350
Yeah.
You can't just take a month off.

3659
02:44:32,351 --> 02:44:34,460
I'm just going to hang out with puking.
Yeah,

3660
02:44:34,730 --> 02:44:39,040
eat your face.
It's a little hood.

3661
02:44:39,130 --> 02:44:41,590
But why couldn't someone engineer an 
eagle?

3662
02:44:41,650 --> 02:44:46,370
That was your buddy that flies you 
around like a fly back early.

3663
02:44:46,390 --> 02:44:51,390
This wolf jacking.
There's a wolf jacking in Eagle and the 

3664
02:44:51,390 --> 02:44:51,390
eagle comes down.
Jackson Wolf.

3665
02:44:51,670 --> 02:44:53,020
Oh Shit.
Like that?

3666
02:44:53,021 --> 02:44:56,350
Both jacket.
This is insane.

3667
02:44:57,340 --> 02:45:00,140
So the wolf was kicking the eagles ass 
and his home.

3668
02:45:00,141 --> 02:45:01,960
He came in and backed him up.
See,

3669
02:45:01,990 --> 02:45:04,840
you shouldn't worry about the monkeys 
because these guys are doing this now.

3670
02:45:04,930 --> 02:45:06,170
See?
I think as men,

3671
02:45:06,290 --> 02:45:11,290
but these eagles are so god damn tough 
and their claws are so fucking 

3672
02:45:11,290 --> 02:45:11,350
terrifying.

3673
02:45:11,380 --> 02:45:13,340
They essentially have knives.
Yeah,

3674
02:45:13,480 --> 02:45:15,760
they're growing their feet.
They're fucking dinosaurs,

3675
02:45:15,761 --> 02:45:20,761
man.
He says this is a dinosaur that made it 

3676
02:45:20,761 --> 02:45:22,600
right and it makes me wonder what 
dinosaurs actually looked like.

3677
02:45:22,630 --> 02:45:27,630
Like we always assume that all dinosaurs
were covered with scales like a 

3678
02:45:27,630 --> 02:45:29,320
crocodile and show.
A lot of them will look at this,

3679
02:45:29,800 --> 02:45:30,940
see there,
duking it out.

3680
02:45:32,140 --> 02:45:37,140
The Eagle lands on him,
started jacking them shoes and he's got 

3681
02:45:37,140 --> 02:45:37,140
them.
He's got him by the neck.

3682
02:45:37,140 --> 02:45:38,350
Oh my God.
It's insane.

3683
02:45:38,710 --> 02:45:43,710
He's killing is just.
He just got full mount on the wolf and 

3684
02:45:43,710 --> 02:45:46,810
he's clawing them to death.
He just keeps committed distance.

3685
02:45:46,960 --> 02:45:48,790
Yeah.
And the Eagles fucked.

3686
02:45:48,850 --> 02:45:50,800
He's got his neck.
This is insane.

3687
02:45:51,610 --> 02:45:54,220
It's insane that they can do this.
That is nuts.

3688
02:45:54,250 --> 02:45:56,410
That's a big ass ego.
That's a Golden Eagle.

3689
02:45:56,411 --> 02:46:01,411
And that's a small wolf by the way.
Those are not as big as it looks like a 

3690
02:46:01,411 --> 02:46:01,720
mid dog.
This is crazy though,

3691
02:46:01,721 --> 02:46:03,790
man.
Now would see feeding him.

3692
02:46:03,791 --> 02:46:06,010
He's giving him a reward.
Is given them some meat.

3693
02:46:06,370 --> 02:46:07,730
Uh,
yeah.

3694
02:46:07,980 --> 02:46:10,030
Always holding the glove meat of

3695
02:46:10,070 --> 02:46:13,340
the carcass.
Gets them back on his arm in the hood.

3696
02:46:13,341 --> 02:46:14,260
Goes on.
Yeah.

3697
02:46:15,080 --> 02:46:16,490
Wow.
Jeez.

3698
02:46:16,760 --> 02:46:20,630
What a wonderful but terrifying animal.
It's a cool hobby.

3699
02:46:21,060 --> 02:46:22,880
You know,
it's not like bread making bread,

3700
02:46:22,881 --> 02:46:26,370
but where's this starter?
They,

3701
02:46:26,371 --> 02:46:27,950
um,
they showed these.

3702
02:46:28,100 --> 02:46:33,100
They had these ancient hominid bones 
they found and they were trying to 

3703
02:46:33,100 --> 02:46:36,551
figure out why they had these claw marks
on them and they were trying to figure 

3704
02:46:36,551 --> 02:46:40,961
out what animal had done it,
and then they recognize very similar 

3705
02:46:40,961 --> 02:46:45,280
patterns of scrapes to what they find on
small primates that are near heartbeat 

3706
02:46:45,351 --> 02:46:48,890
eagles,
and they realized that early humans were

3707
02:46:48,891 --> 02:46:51,740
most likely eaten by eagles.
Really?

3708
02:46:51,800 --> 02:46:53,720
Yeah.
A bigger eagle.

3709
02:46:53,810 --> 02:46:58,810
Like a pterodactyl sizing gang of 
different kinds of birds and large 

3710
02:46:58,810 --> 02:46:59,910
predatory birds.
Yeah.

3711
02:47:00,190 --> 02:47:01,460
In fact,
North America,

3712
02:47:01,740 --> 02:47:05,270
like I believe before,
like,

3713
02:47:05,420 --> 02:47:07,400
oh,
I don't want to say how long ago,

3714
02:47:07,401 --> 02:47:08,720
but I don't think it was too long ago.

3715
02:47:09,020 --> 02:47:12,390
Like not even a million years.
They had a thing called a Tara Byrd.

3716
02:47:13,030 --> 02:47:18,030
Tera Byrd was like a giant seven foot 
tall predatory bird that didn't fly.

3717
02:47:20,120 --> 02:47:23,010
It was like a Standing Burger.
Giant beat.

3718
02:47:23,040 --> 02:47:27,470
Like a huge predatory Karl Malone sized 
bird.

3719
02:47:27,650 --> 02:47:30,170
That's crazy.
How about that?

3720
02:47:30,171 --> 02:47:35,171
Let's make that movie.
How about a magic Johnson sized bird 

3721
02:47:35,171 --> 02:47:37,730
with a giant fucking hatchet for a face?
Not even flying.

3722
02:47:37,731 --> 02:47:38,830
I don't have to.
Yeah.

3723
02:47:38,840 --> 02:47:43,840
You should see that they do a 
superimposed image of the size of a 

3724
02:47:43,840 --> 02:47:45,470
normal human,
like have a six foot tall humans next to

3725
02:47:45,471 --> 02:47:48,770
a terror or like what they looked like.
I love Tara Byrd.

3726
02:47:48,771 --> 02:47:50,630
That's a generic name isn't a 
terrifying,

3727
02:47:51,010 --> 02:47:52,730
and this is North America.
This is right here.

3728
02:47:52,760 --> 02:47:53,840
She's.
Yeah,

3729
02:47:53,870 --> 02:47:58,870
so there was A.
I mean the entire fossil record even 

3730
02:47:58,870 --> 02:48:00,750
just of males is not complete.
There's,

3731
02:48:00,800 --> 02:48:04,220
they're always finding new things 
because in order to create a fossil,

3732
02:48:04,520 --> 02:48:07,000
it's very difficult to like something 
has to happen.

3733
02:48:07,030 --> 02:48:08,470
You have to get caught in the mud 
sliders.

3734
02:48:09,720 --> 02:48:11,630
Jamie,
see if he could find a terror picture.

3735
02:48:11,690 --> 02:48:16,690
I'd love to see thing.
Look at that fucking thing as a soldier 

3736
02:48:16,690 --> 02:48:21,011
that gets eat.
The one in the left that looks like 

3737
02:48:21,011 --> 02:48:21,790
where the wild things are.
Yeah.

3738
02:48:21,960 --> 02:48:25,640
It doesn't even look like it's a real 
thing.

3739
02:48:26,300 --> 02:48:29,780
Look at the size of that fucking thing.
It's eggs must be huge.

3740
02:48:29,840 --> 02:48:31,250
Oh my God.
Like ahead.

3741
02:48:31,340 --> 02:48:32,840
Yeah.
Bigger,

3742
02:48:32,960 --> 02:48:35,600
bigger.
Look at the size of that fucker.

3743
02:48:35,910 --> 02:48:37,910
Wasn't there a movie where people riding
those?

3744
02:48:37,970 --> 02:48:42,970
Maybe,
but it's interesting that one of them 

3745
02:48:42,970 --> 02:48:42,970
has fairly large wings.
The one on the right,

3746
02:48:42,970 --> 02:48:44,540
but the one on the left has like these 
nubs.

3747
02:48:44,690 --> 02:48:47,360
Yeah.
He's like all different terror birds.

3748
02:48:47,370 --> 02:48:51,170
All fucking cry.
Oh my God.

3749
02:48:52,960 --> 02:48:57,960
The one in the forefront.
The one that the evil red looking beak 

3750
02:48:57,960 --> 02:49:02,170
and the one in the backgrounds like that
one's like almost flamingo ostrich 

3751
02:49:02,170 --> 02:49:05,711
monster.
Could you imagine if you were just 

3752
02:49:05,711 --> 02:49:07,721
walking along and you saw something 
popping its head out of the trees 

3753
02:49:07,721 --> 02:49:08,040
looking at you funny.
It's that

3754
02:49:08,040 --> 02:49:09,690
size and you go,
oh my God,

3755
02:49:09,691 --> 02:49:11,520
it's over.
It's over.

3756
02:49:11,820 --> 02:49:15,420
My Cat's been on a bird killing spree.
Good for her or him.

3757
02:49:15,421 --> 02:49:17,970
Brings in a couple of week.
Really?

3758
02:49:18,120 --> 02:49:19,950
It's really out of hand.
Well,

3759
02:49:19,970 --> 02:49:24,970
you get better.
Be careful if you let your cat out 

3760
02:49:24,970 --> 02:49:24,970
because you can get jacked by coyote.
No,

3761
02:49:24,970 --> 02:49:25,830
it's his.
It's his life.

3762
02:49:26,370 --> 02:49:29,370
Wow.
That's brutal clause or no claws.

3763
02:49:29,900 --> 02:49:31,440
Claws.
Scott clause.

3764
02:49:31,441 --> 02:49:34,890
And you let them scan.
He's an outdoor and he just.

3765
02:49:35,160 --> 02:49:37,400
He's a nut.
He can't see who's been an outdoor cat.

3766
02:49:37,440 --> 02:49:38,910
Yeah.
Does he come inside at all?

3767
02:49:38,970 --> 02:49:40,950
Yeah.
Comes in place in your house.

3768
02:49:41,650 --> 02:49:46,650
Now they do.
If you don't get them fixed quick 

3769
02:49:46,650 --> 02:49:46,650
enough.
I have an indoor cat,

3770
02:49:46,930 --> 02:49:49,350
an indoor and outdoor.
My minor,

3771
02:49:49,351 --> 02:49:51,080
both indoor because,
um,

3772
02:49:51,510 --> 02:49:53,250
I live in a place where a lot of coyotes
are.

3773
02:49:53,270 --> 02:49:58,270
I guess my,
one of my chickens got jacked by a 

3774
02:49:58,270 --> 02:49:58,270
coyote.
I watched it happen.

3775
02:49:58,270 --> 02:49:59,160
I would have hopped the fence.
My chicken in his mouth.

3776
02:50:00,260 --> 02:50:05,260
Yeah.
We had a separate chickens get broody 

3777
02:50:05,260 --> 02:50:05,260
means they,
um,

3778
02:50:05,260 --> 02:50:09,520
they,
they get confused since they're not 

3779
02:50:09,520 --> 02:50:11,721
getting fucked by roosters.
Sometimes they think that they have an 

3780
02:50:11,721 --> 02:50:11,721
egg that they have to hatch,
that they have to,

3781
02:50:11,721 --> 02:50:12,320
uh,
you know,

3782
02:50:12,570 --> 02:50:13,500
uh,
what's that called?

3783
02:50:13,800 --> 02:50:16,440
What's it called?
The nurture and egg to sit on it.

3784
02:50:16,780 --> 02:50:16,960
Yeah.

3785
02:50:19,890 --> 02:50:22,300
Who,
something again,

3786
02:50:22,810 --> 02:50:25,630
what's the word?
I'm just state.

3787
02:50:25,980 --> 02:50:28,120
No,
that's not a um,

3788
02:50:29,370 --> 02:50:34,170
um,
lay on top of what's it called?

3789
02:50:34,171 --> 02:50:37,710
Like when you take an egg and you put it
in one of those warming things,

3790
02:50:38,240 --> 02:50:43,240
you like lamp goes.
People will listen to this screaming you

3791
02:50:44,461 --> 02:50:46,680
fucking planet.
Even Remember,

3792
02:50:48,760 --> 02:50:51,320
Oh,
I knew it was a,

3793
02:50:52,600 --> 02:50:56,830
I was trying to avoid the band incubus.
Um,

3794
02:50:57,210 --> 02:50:58,270
but anyway,
um,

3795
02:50:58,420 --> 02:50:59,700
it was,
it was thinking,

3796
02:50:59,701 --> 02:51:00,750
it was,
it was thinking that,

3797
02:51:00,930 --> 02:51:05,930
so we have to take them out and she had 
to get outside of regular chicken coop.

3798
02:51:06,481 --> 02:51:11,481
It's just large coop and you have to put
her in one where she has to sit on a 

3799
02:51:11,481 --> 02:51:12,990
beam.
It's a very small for the amount of time

3800
02:51:12,991 --> 02:51:15,090
they broody that's how much time you 
have to put them in there.

3801
02:51:15,091 --> 02:51:17,670
Otherwise they could be broody for like 
a month.

3802
02:51:17,671 --> 02:51:19,590
They'll pull their,
their feathers out,

3803
02:51:20,810 --> 02:51:22,320
cause some health issues.

3804
02:51:22,380 --> 02:51:27,380
They pluck the feathers out of their 
chest to feather their nest for an egg 

3805
02:51:27,380 --> 02:51:28,350
that's not going to hatch.
They get a little wacky,

3806
02:51:28,790 --> 02:51:30,750
weird.
Well their brains are fucking thumbnail,

3807
02:51:31,080 --> 02:51:32,100
right?
So,

3808
02:51:32,101 --> 02:51:37,101
uh,
this coyote just figured out a way to 

3809
02:51:37,101 --> 02:51:40,131
get into that little cage and jack the 
chicken and jumped over the fence with 

3810
02:51:40,131 --> 02:51:40,700
it.
Yeah,

3811
02:51:40,770 --> 02:51:43,920
I mean it's definitely a risk.
And a couple of neighbors,

3812
02:51:44,100 --> 02:51:46,470
one neighbor lost a cat,
you know,

3813
02:51:46,471 --> 02:51:48,090
like 10 years ago too.
It's not,

3814
02:51:48,140 --> 02:51:51,450
it's like the beginning of coyote.
It gives us not a lot going on,

3815
02:51:51,451 --> 02:51:54,450
but enough where if the cat's not smart 
but it could happen,

3816
02:51:54,950 --> 02:51:58,500
but the cat is so happy and that's just 
the way he lives and it's like,

3817
02:51:58,560 --> 02:51:59,950
you know.
Yeah.

3818
02:52:00,330 --> 02:52:00,810
You know,
we.

3819
02:52:00,840 --> 02:52:02,630
Everyone would be sad,
but yes.

3820
02:52:02,660 --> 02:52:03,990
His life.
Yeah.

3821
02:52:03,991 --> 02:52:08,991
It's probably not the worst way to go 
either quick rather than getting 

3822
02:52:08,991 --> 02:52:10,290
diabetes and cancer.

3823
02:52:10,300 --> 02:52:11,140
Diabetes.
Yeah.

3824
02:52:11,141 --> 02:52:12,550
I hit a diabetic.
Can't whoa.

3825
02:52:12,610 --> 02:52:14,210
So you have to give you the insulin.
Yeah.

3826
02:52:14,380 --> 02:52:15,540
Whoa.
Every day.

3827
02:52:16,600 --> 02:52:18,220
Twice.
That's probably pissed at you.

3828
02:52:18,610 --> 02:52:23,610
Didn't.
I had no idea why you shoot me this 

3829
02:52:23,610 --> 02:52:23,610
fucking needle.
Bitch.

3830
02:52:23,610 --> 02:52:26,620
I want pets putting a pill on a,
like a sticky as a fire and its throat.

3831
02:52:26,621 --> 02:52:28,750
That's how you do it.
That's one of the things that.

3832
02:52:28,751 --> 02:52:29,970
And the insula.
He probably.

3833
02:52:31,500 --> 02:52:34,840
Did he run from you all the time now?
He was pretty mellow.

3834
02:52:34,841 --> 02:52:38,650
He's probably extended his life for 
another four years.

3835
02:52:38,770 --> 02:52:40,030
Oh.
And then,

3836
02:52:40,031 --> 02:52:42,370
uh,
it just all ended up failing,

3837
02:52:43,120 --> 02:52:44,880
but you know,
it was like I will,

3838
02:52:44,910 --> 02:52:46,230
you know,
it was my wife's cat.

3839
02:52:46,300 --> 02:52:51,300
If I would have,
you would have ended up probably would 

3840
02:52:51,300 --> 02:52:52,870
not have shots for that long hatchet,
which is Rosen method.

3841
02:52:53,830 --> 02:52:58,230
Just opened the door and make coyote 
calls.

3842
02:52:58,370 --> 02:52:59,190
Yeah,
it was a,

3843
02:52:59,270 --> 02:53:00,080
it was a nice cat.

3844
02:53:00,080 --> 02:53:05,080
But yeah,
I never knew there was this thing as a 

3845
02:53:05,080 --> 02:53:05,080
diabetic cat and uh,
yeah,

3846
02:53:05,080 --> 02:53:06,310
we extended his life for awhile and then
uh,

3847
02:53:06,311 --> 02:53:08,510
you know,
the other things start to fail.

3848
02:53:08,580 --> 02:53:11,040
You try feeding him a Vegan Diet?
No,

3849
02:53:11,710 --> 02:53:13,610
it's supposed to cure diabetes.
Oh yeah.

3850
02:53:13,760 --> 02:53:14,980
No,
I can things up.

3851
02:53:16,340 --> 02:53:18,680
But people do have their cats and they 
feed them vegan food.

3852
02:53:18,830 --> 02:53:19,490
Really?
Yeah.

3853
02:53:19,610 --> 02:53:23,600
Cats die young.
Sad irony.

3854
02:53:24,010 --> 02:53:25,820
And their attempt to not be cruel to 
animals.

3855
02:53:25,821 --> 02:53:30,821
They're cruel to the animals at the 
feeding and fucking plums cell range.

3856
02:53:31,010 --> 02:53:35,360
I just saw this 30 year old dog 
yesterday on the Internet.

3857
02:53:35,361 --> 02:53:37,310
Have you ever heard of.
That's crazy.

3858
02:53:37,311 --> 02:53:40,130
What kind of dirty?
It's an Australian.

3859
02:53:40,170 --> 02:53:42,440
They can't prove how old it really is,
but oh,

3860
02:53:42,470 --> 02:53:43,490
there's some video of it.
I mean,

3861
02:53:43,491 --> 02:53:45,440
it looks like it's fucking 30 in dog 
years.

3862
02:53:45,460 --> 02:53:50,330
That's 36 years old.

3863
02:53:51,080 --> 02:53:53,750
Oh Wow.
That's crazy.

3864
02:53:54,220 --> 02:53:57,180
30 [inaudible] the owners must be like,
all right,

3865
02:53:57,200 --> 02:53:58,170
dude.
See here,

3866
02:53:58,171 --> 02:54:03,171
there's no proof.
As long as there's no proof and we're 

3867
02:54:03,171 --> 02:54:05,091
reading about this,
we have no fucking idea how old that 

3868
02:54:05,091 --> 02:54:05,160
dog.
This is a bullshit story.

3869
02:54:06,310 --> 02:54:08,290
That's the problem with God damn 
stories.

3870
02:54:08,291 --> 02:54:10,890
It's all you have to do is you get paid 
per ad clicks.

3871
02:54:10,891 --> 02:54:11,750
Yeah,
exactly.

3872
02:54:11,790 --> 02:54:15,860
Just put a picture up and that's it.
See like that.

3873
02:54:15,861 --> 02:54:19,010
Three men who admitted to raping a girl.
17 won't be jailed.

3874
02:54:19,130 --> 02:54:22,580
That's a lie too.
Must read and this guy's got his abs out

3875
02:54:22,581 --> 02:54:24,590
there taking the photo.
What are you trying to do?

3876
02:54:24,591 --> 02:54:27,230
You're trying to get me to click so it 
might not be about that.

3877
02:54:27,260 --> 02:54:30,980
No associated with it.
And then someone will get paid.

3878
02:54:31,040 --> 02:54:31,520
Tom,
Papa,

3879
02:54:31,521 --> 02:54:34,790
we have run out of time here really 
quick.

3880
02:54:34,791 --> 02:54:36,200
I know that was three hours of fun,
my friend.

3881
02:54:36,200 --> 02:54:37,310
It's crazy.
It was great though.

3882
02:54:37,370 --> 02:54:38,810
It really crazy.
Enjoyed talking to you,

3883
02:54:38,811 --> 02:54:39,260
man.
Thank you.

3884
02:54:39,261 --> 02:54:39,740
I,
you know,

3885
02:54:39,741 --> 02:54:42,170
I've been here once before and I've been
itching to get back.

3886
02:54:42,190 --> 02:54:43,150
It's good.
Hang.

3887
02:54:43,210 --> 02:54:44,540
I think this was better than our first 
one.

3888
02:54:44,630 --> 02:54:45,650
Yeah,
I really do.

3889
02:54:45,740 --> 02:54:49,810
I do a lot of starters.
I learned about a lot about yeast and,

3890
02:54:49,811 --> 02:54:53,120
and muscle tissue.
Now you to get me,

3891
02:54:54,080 --> 02:54:56,750
get me a hot car and do that.
We'll do that when we get off there.

3892
02:54:57,080 --> 02:54:59,660
I'll show you how to do it.
All Right Ladies and gentlemen,

3893
02:54:59,690 --> 02:55:01,560
that's it for the week.
Me,

3894
02:55:01,900 --> 02:55:04,100
you fucks.
The next week.

3895
02:55:04,100 --> 02:55:06,770
I've got four of them,
so straddle up,

3896
02:55:06,870 --> 02:55:10,130
got a lot of love.
And start with Cameron Hanes on Monday.

3897
02:55:10,400 --> 02:55:11,400
Um,
uh,

3898
02:55:11,450 --> 02:55:16,450
my friend Doug,
during this coming next week I got a but

3899
02:55:18,710 --> 02:55:21,580

Oh boss ruin.

3900
02:55:21,581 --> 02:55:23,570
And tomorrow Rinella are going to be 
here.

3901
02:55:23,630 --> 02:55:27,110
And Robin Black.
It's going to be a hell of a week.

3902
02:55:27,111 --> 02:55:28,030
You have.
