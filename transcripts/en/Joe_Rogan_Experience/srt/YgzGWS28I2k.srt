1
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:06,700
Three,
two,

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,120
one.
Oh,

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,940
away from.
Don't know why your brother.

4
00:00:10,941 --> 00:00:12,500
What's going on?
Good to see you again,

5
00:00:12,501 --> 00:00:13,340
man.
Hell yeah.

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,353
You're on a wild.
A magical mystery tour of the United 

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,740
States of America here.
It's been amazing with your kids.

8
00:00:18,741 --> 00:00:20,480
You cute little kids.
Door doors,

9
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:21,980
damaged door,
not your own.

10
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,630
Dick Meyer.
Adorable.

11
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,880
I love kids.
But you,

12
00:00:25,881 --> 00:00:27,230
uh,
you're taking them to.

13
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,810
You took everybody like you.
You're here for how many months?

14
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,110
Five months.
You moving tired of Australia?

15
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,540
Just the big trip.
No,

16
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:37,340
it's better over here.
It is.

17
00:00:37,341 --> 00:00:40,520
I love America.
I can't say that.

18
00:00:40,521 --> 00:00:41,600
They won't let you back in.
Yeah,

19
00:00:41,601 --> 00:00:44,570
probably not.
They're very different.

20
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:49,040
But the American landscape,
how unique the landscape is.

21
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,960
The rocky mountains to the desert.
It's just.

22
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,280
Yeah,
hate.

23
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,450
Everyone really thinks Australia is just
like these fucking flat pays the sand.

24
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,680
Mountain ranges and shit.
Really?

25
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,830
How tall they get 'em out and either 
high,

26
00:01:06,831 --> 00:01:09,260
but they're up there like a real 
mountain.

27
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,880
Rocky Mountain.
Lack of real mountain.

28
00:01:10,881 --> 00:01:11,750
Like Rocky Mountain.
Yeah.

29
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:12,643
Really?
Yeah.

30
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,710
Wow.
Dude.

31
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,613
Let me tell you something.
Your 28 days that you did in the rocky 

32
00:01:17,601 --> 00:01:19,940
mountains out here that we put on 
Instagram,

33
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,550
you know that we're promoting it 
constantly.

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,833
That was one of the most talked about 
like every I got calls from all my 

35
00:01:26,661 --> 00:01:28,910
friend Bert Kreischer was fucking 
obsessed with you.

36
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:33,530
He wouldn't stop calling me about it.
He's like the fucking goes by himself to

37
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:34,543
do the video with him,
with the grizzly bear and he's pointing 

38
00:01:36,081 --> 00:01:37,730
the gun at it.
Jesus Christ,

39
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,350
can we.
This thing is it's.

40
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,510
That's normal shit.
It is.

41
00:01:41,511 --> 00:01:44,450
That's very normal society so removed 
from it now.

42
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,250
Well,
if you're out there,

43
00:01:46,251 --> 00:01:50,830
it's normal to get false charged by a 
grizzly bear isn't living with 90.

44
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,280
Yeah.
One good reason.

45
00:01:52,281 --> 00:01:53,630
Not fucking be out.

46
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,880
I was talking with Kim about this when 
we hiked into the back of Montana to the

47
00:01:59,881 --> 00:02:00,714
spot that's usually got a bunch of 
grizzly bears that I go to and we'll 

48
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,613
talk about you.
How you won't come out to Australia 

49
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,140
hunting.
He just scared of everything.

50
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,800
The difference is when you're walking 
around the mountains here,

51
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,630
it can happen at any point because 
fucking grizzly bears,

52
00:02:13,631 --> 00:02:15,030
they got feet,
they walk on land.

53
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,223
In Australia,
you pretty much have to go into the 

54
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:19,800
water,
so you're only worried about that.

55
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,693
When you go to click water or you're 
thinking about having a washer or 

56
00:02:22,831 --> 00:02:23,581
something.
Here,

57
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:24,414
it's full time.

58
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:25,823
For whatever reason,
it doesn't bother me as much to get 

59
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:33,080
killed and eaten by a bear.
Does giant saltwater crocodile.

60
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,600
I reckon the crocodile would be nicer,
but yeah,

61
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:39,270
it'd be nicer.
Like grab you drag it down.

62
00:02:39,271 --> 00:02:41,040
You'd drowned anyway,
you know,

63
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,040
and then it would do what it wants to 
go.

64
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,190
A grizzly bear is going to fuck a mole 
year.

65
00:02:45,191 --> 00:02:47,130
Scratch your face off.
Bite your neck,

66
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,620
take chunks out here.
It's going to be longer,

67
00:02:49,621 --> 00:02:50,230
dude.

68
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,370
Yeah,
but it's American.

69
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,030
We're want no foreign shit.
Fucking know.

70
00:02:58,031 --> 00:03:01,830
Florida is eating to this summer about a
grizzly bears.

71
00:03:01,831 --> 00:03:04,210
It's most terrifying things that they 
just eat you.

72
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,120
They don't kill you first.
He just holds you down eating you.

73
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,870
Yeah.
Yeah.

74
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,580
They treat you the same way.
They treat a salmon.

75
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,453
You know,
when you see them hold on salmon and 

76
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:14,010
they take big bites out,
they don't make sure they killed

77
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,030
thought behind it,
you know,

78
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,730
like,
I'll finish it off first.

79
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:20,880
And then did you say the mountain lion 
that I ended up hunting?

80
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:21,540
Yes.
Yeah,

81
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,410
he did.
Yeah.

82
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,840
And like mountain lions usually kill 
their prey,

83
00:03:24,841 --> 00:03:27,720
but obviously grabbed the cough and 
eliminating this cough

84
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,320
was still alive like a beef cow calf.
Yeah.

85
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,330
I saw the video pretty disturbing.
And then

86
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,673
I seen him on not long ago.
Someone shared with me with a mountain 

87
00:03:37,021 --> 00:03:39,240
lion dragon,
a mule deer down.

88
00:03:39,241 --> 00:03:42,300
It's like chomping on this mule deer 
before it actually dies,

89
00:03:42,301 --> 00:03:43,134
you know?
And it's like there's just not that 

90
00:03:44,671 --> 00:03:47,460
thought process there.
There's not that human.

91
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,780
No,
as long as they make sure that they have

92
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:51,580
it as a meal,
it's not going anywhere.

93
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:52,414
They're just getting done with
some friends were elk hunting and they 

94
00:03:57,761 --> 00:03:59,650
came across as elk who,
uh,

95
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:03,900
these wolves had torn the back legs 
apart and were,

96
00:04:03,901 --> 00:04:04,734
uh,
it was in the river and the wolves were 

97
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,383
eating it while it was in the river.
And the thing was moaning and screaming 

98
00:04:09,851 --> 00:04:13,070
and couldn't go anywhere but bull elk in
the,

99
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:18,010
in the water and they just pretty,
pretty horrible for us.

100
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,940
But I don't give a fuck.
That's standard for them.

101
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,330
So have you encountered any bulls when 
you're out there?

102
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,490
Yeah,
plenty of times.

103
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,333
Jay.
The first time I went to Canada was 

104
00:04:28,891 --> 00:04:29,724
northwest territories and there was a 
pack of wolves that chase chasing a 

105
00:04:33,031 --> 00:04:37,980
Caribou bull and they pretty much chased
this thing to like a lever of sweat,

106
00:04:37,981 --> 00:04:39,840
you know,
like this is the winter.

107
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,620
So the bull Caribou bull got really hot 
and like chased it,

108
00:04:43,621 --> 00:04:44,454
ended up freezing cold river and I sorta
surrounded in the river and then I just 

109
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:49,230
left it and I walked off,
you know.

110
00:04:49,231 --> 00:04:51,150
And it wasn't that they'll walk away 
from their killed.

111
00:04:51,151 --> 00:04:51,984
I knew the job was done,
the wolves went back up high and they 

112
00:04:54,131 --> 00:04:54,964
get onto these rocky benches and sat in 
the sun and we'll log drawn out their 

113
00:04:57,481 --> 00:05:01,440
souls and cooling down and drawing out 
these Caribou never left the river.

114
00:05:01,441 --> 00:05:02,274
It was just quivering in the river.
And then that afternoon when we come 

115
00:05:05,611 --> 00:05:10,020
back that Caribou is just a caucus.
We've like flesh hanging off the ribs on

116
00:05:10,021 --> 00:05:10,854
the side of the river.
So they come back down once the river 

117
00:05:12,301 --> 00:05:13,200
had done his job and

118
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,700
wow,
smart as hell I.

119
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,890
that's,
that's really crazy that,

120
00:05:17,891 --> 00:05:19,920
that intelligent that they know.
It's over.

121
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,311
Like,
oh,

122
00:05:20,311 --> 00:05:22,390
okay.
He's in the water in the water can chill

123
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,410
now.
Dry Off.

124
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,253
Yeah.
Yeah.

125
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,570
That has been crazy.
I are so wise.

126
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,703
People that I know that I've seen them 
in the forest say they look at you a 

127
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,120
different way.
They look at you,

128
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:33,983
there's a way they look through you.
They look at you in a way like almost 

129
00:05:38,581 --> 00:05:43,581
like they think that that's the reason 
why the myth of the Werewolf exists.

130
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,830
Is it people that have these terrifying 
encounters with wolves,

131
00:05:46,831 --> 00:05:51,831
they swear it's part human because you 
make a's and into looking into you.

132
00:05:51,841 --> 00:05:53,410
They're figuring you out.
You know,

133
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,580
you got to think what it would be like 
if you're just out there.

134
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,730
You know,
if you're lucky,

135
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:57,980
live

136
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,320
five years old,
right?

137
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,283
You get this hard scrabble life out 
there chasing much larger animals than 

138
00:06:03,861 --> 00:06:05,720
you and you've got to kill them with 
your face.

139
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,780
Yeah.
Crazy.

140
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:10,843
I had a pack of like 30 wolves this last
trip that I was in BC and I kept coming 

141
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:17,110
around camp.
We had horses in that,

142
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:17,944
in camp and um,
one day I ventured out to try and get 

143
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:24,830
onto them and get a better look at them 
and like just without seeing me,

144
00:06:24,831 --> 00:06:27,200
they just kept these perfect range,
you know,

145
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:29,750
like that hail back to me.
I was trying to call him and all is hell

146
00:06:29,751 --> 00:06:30,584
and that back to me and I just hate 
these perfect range and you could tell 

147
00:06:33,201 --> 00:06:34,034
the whole time now communicating because
then there'd be a novel Wolf for a 

148
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,023
couple of wolves that were like a couple
of miles in the other direction and you 

149
00:06:39,741 --> 00:06:43,300
could hear them moving the same patent 
that the rest of these walls were.

150
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:48,080
And I got eyes on him from a distance.
I walked across the Nice Lake.

151
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:51,020
And other than that,
I never really seen him.

152
00:06:51,021 --> 00:06:54,200
But I guarantee you those wolves looked 
at and they have a bunch of times,

153
00:06:54,201 --> 00:06:55,940
like they're just a different haunted 
dude.

154
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,390
They'd probably just trying to figure 
out what they can do with you.

155
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,233
Yeah,

156
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,143
such an eerie feeling too.
So it's like snow and it's like why in 

157
00:07:03,851 --> 00:07:08,680
the back country of British Columbia and
like I'm going up on these mountains.

158
00:07:08,681 --> 00:07:12,760
It's like big pine trees and everything 
like that in every direction around you,

159
00:07:12,761 --> 00:07:13,594
hal.
And you'd hear them how and you'd hear 

160
00:07:15,131 --> 00:07:17,020
him do it.
Sounds like a Bach.

161
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:17,854
It's not as likely the short hair.
And then every now and then you'd hear 

162
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:23,770
one hail different and you could tell 
that that was the alpha.

163
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,610
This the sound that it was lit now,
dude,

164
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,400
earring or some place to be.
If you're in the night,

165
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:34,530
she'll a crazy place to be if you're not
in an internet chef.

166
00:07:34,531 --> 00:07:37,350
Fucking like,
yeah.

167
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:38,883
Well the thing about them that's so 
fascinating about them is they're 

168
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:45,150
cooperative and they almost are.
They know what to do without,

169
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,500
without even communicating.
They know what to do.

170
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:49,880
They have plans and strategies.
He know how to,

171
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,003
how to box someone in circle around like
if an animal's running in a certain 

172
00:07:54,101 --> 00:07:55,630
direction,
they get out in front of it.

173
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,220
They know what to do.
You know what to do.

174
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,063
Yeah.
So they end up being a set of Caribou 

175
00:07:59,991 --> 00:08:00,824
tracks that I ended up getting onto and 
following and every wolf track was a 

176
00:08:04,341 --> 00:08:09,230
certain section of pot from that and 
I'll funnel it into these big drainage.

177
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,200
I had to end up returning back to camp 
because it was getting dark,

178
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:13,034
but I would've loved to have kept 
following insane if I actually like 

179
00:08:16,011 --> 00:08:19,040
their efficient good chance.
I ended up catching that Caribou,

180
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:19,940
you know,
and killing it.

181
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:23,120
Yeah.
Well it's really interesting seeing them

182
00:08:23,121 --> 00:08:27,710
adapt to a once in 1994 when they get 
reintroduced to yellowstone,

183
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:28,843
seeing them readapt to the whole west 
and really expand and dominic and we 

184
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:41,610
were talking recently about Wyoming.
There was this one surplus kill.

185
00:08:41,761 --> 00:08:45,740
These wolves had run across a bunch of 
cows,

186
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:49,580
milk cows and they killed like 18 of 
them just killed him.

187
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,350
Just slaughter and yeah,
they just,

188
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,210
they got,
they caught him.

189
00:08:52,211 --> 00:08:55,320
I think in high snow and they couldn't 
get away and so these wolves,

190
00:08:55,321 --> 00:08:56,100
just one after

191
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,050
another,
just killed them all and didn't even eat

192
00:08:58,051 --> 00:08:59,190
them.
They just practice.

193
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,500
I think it's good practice and also 
think,

194
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:02,550
well,
it's snowy out.

195
00:09:02,551 --> 00:09:03,420
They probably figured,
look,

196
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:06,440
we'll come back to this.
We'll leave it in a pile of official.

197
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,343
Yeah.
It's that whole nothing ever goes to 

198
00:09:09,171 --> 00:09:09,901
waste.
I suppose.

199
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:11,960
If they don't eat it,
then grizzly eats it.

200
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,820
If the grizzly donate it birds already.
Something neat it.

201
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,250
Yeah.
That's a fact.

202
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:22,150
An animal like mean.
Even if a hunter hits an animal,

203
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,680
it doesn't recover it,
that it's not going to waste.

204
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,503
Everything goes back to the values 
before you know the world's ultimate 

205
00:09:30,061 --> 00:09:32,490
Predator though.
Like everything's fuel in the world,

206
00:09:32,491 --> 00:09:33,810
you know,
the growth on the earth.

207
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,580
Yeah.
It really is a,

208
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,493
it's just a fascinating cycle when you 
were out there and you realize that it 

209
00:09:39,301 --> 00:09:44,301
doesn't care about four g or cities or 
code J.

210
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:48,000
Four J.
Shit.

211
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,280
I remember when four g was good.
Three G,

212
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,930
three g lte.
Yeah,

213
00:09:51,931 --> 00:09:53,970
that's the one.
It's a good one.

214
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,953
Yeah.
Yeah.

215
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:56,963
When you're out there in the woods and 
you're doing these live streams or 

216
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:00,090
these,
um,

217
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:00,720
these,
uh,

218
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,880
instagram stories,
how are you,

219
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,460
how are you hooking up when you're out?
Some of them aside.

220
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:06,783
So some of them are like,
I think the last year on I did the Solo 

221
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,223
Ad Hawk for the Arnhem Land,
locked the northern territory of 

222
00:10:13,591 --> 00:10:16,440
Australia.
That was like a 13 day.

223
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,590
The lag I think where every dial is 
still documenting it,

224
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,633
but it wasn't until that I got back into
civilization that I was uploading the 

225
00:10:23,071 --> 00:10:25,350
day each day.
So when you do it on your phone,

226
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,890
it just saves it on the phone.
I'm just filming it in the normal camera

227
00:10:28,891 --> 00:10:31,950
mode and then uploading it.
But a lot of places,

228
00:10:31,951 --> 00:10:34,830
especially here in the US when you're up
high,

229
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,200
like usually I've got half decent 
reception.

230
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:40,600
I'll do a little bit of research,
what's the best provider in their area,

231
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,510
Ita,
verizon,

232
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:43,344
whatever it is,
and I'll end up getting a sim card for 

233
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:49,380
that provider.
And then usually if I'm not part,

234
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,233
it's not too bad,
but just depends on your legs back 

235
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,913
concrete basically.
Nothing could all northern territory of 

236
00:10:55,801 --> 00:10:58,080
Australia like Arnhem land,
like nothing at all.

237
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,573
What about satellite?
You can't upload data really well from 

238
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,980
satellite.
Yeah.

239
00:11:04,981 --> 00:11:06,930
That's the issue.
And if you could,

240
00:11:06,931 --> 00:11:10,110
you'd want to be freaking rich because 
it would charge you a nominal leg.

241
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,530
Yeah,
I saw these things at Rei.

242
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:14,723
You put them on your backpack.
It's like an extender and somehow or 

243
00:11:18,151 --> 00:11:18,984
another extends your cell phone rings.
I used to use them back in the olden 

244
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,703
days.
They legit,

245
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,573
uh,
the ones in Australia where they'll 

246
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:25,933
three g like Telstra,
three j that's provided back home now 

247
00:11:29,601 --> 00:11:30,060
we're pretty good.

248
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:30,893
We could have like a big antenna and 
hanging off your back and I'm not that 

249
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:34,830
into.
It wasn't that bad.

250
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:39,831
It was like the size of this cave man.
It was pretty small.

251
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:45,390
It was just clip on and I don't remember
exactly the mechanism behind it.

252
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,420
That'd be handy if I'm just trying to 
communicate with home.

253
00:11:48,421 --> 00:11:51,220
I've got like a Garmin inreach sorta 
thing.

254
00:11:51,221 --> 00:11:52,054
And you can do,
you do texts off your phone because it 

255
00:11:53,951 --> 00:11:56,620
like actually goes into your fine.
But as far as data goes,

256
00:11:56,621 --> 00:11:59,090
it's too slow to do something like insta
stories.

257
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,150
Right,
right.

258
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,540
Well,
one day,

259
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,793
wasn't it Mark Zuckerberg?
Wasn't he trying to like put satellites 

260
00:12:06,071 --> 00:12:09,190
in space to make Internet for the whole 
world?

261
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,570
Yeah,
it feels like we need it.

262
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,280
They stopped doing that once Congress 
started going.

263
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,720
I know,
I know for sure.

264
00:12:16,721 --> 00:12:18,370
One of them,
they had an a.

265
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,780
One of the tests are rockets that went 
up,

266
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:22,280
that exploded.
I remember one real.

267
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:23,650
It didn't make it or something like 
that.

268
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:24,603
Yeah,
it's basic and they had stuff in that 

269
00:12:25,931 --> 00:12:27,730
one I believe.
I don't think that's ruined it,

270
00:12:27,731 --> 00:12:32,500
but it probably put a big halt on it.
That makes sense.

271
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:35,800
I always think how you can be so much 
unorganized.

272
00:12:35,801 --> 00:12:36,220
Now,
look,

273
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,210
we've worked and stuff because of where 
phones nutter,

274
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:39,483
but I remember like in the construction 
industry that morning that you left the 

275
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,413
work,
you had to be highly frigging organized 

276
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,053
because it wasn't a.
You had to go back to a payphone if you 

277
00:12:47,741 --> 00:12:49,510
wanted to call someone.
No one wanted to do that.

278
00:12:49,511 --> 00:12:52,660
Especially from a work site that I'm 
now.

279
00:12:52,661 --> 00:12:53,494
It's just the whole,
I just remember when emails come and 

280
00:12:55,201 --> 00:12:57,040
fine and I was like,
Holy Shit,

281
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,390
I can save some time now.

282
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,580
Like that was a massive break for,
for business,

283
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:01,923
being able to do that and then.
But it's also nice to step away from 

284
00:13:04,811 --> 00:13:05,644
that every now and then like some hunts 
I'm really looking forward to going to 

285
00:13:09,551 --> 00:13:11,980
because there isn't any reception,
you know,

286
00:13:11,981 --> 00:13:13,900
and you get away from emails,
business work,

287
00:13:13,901 --> 00:13:15,460
phone calls,
all the shit.

288
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,720
It's just you and nature,
you know.

289
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,410
It's sort of Nice to be like that.
What Steven Life.

290
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,770
I think we're all spending too much time
on our phones.

291
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:27,020
Too much time being connected in.
Two of my friends are,

292
00:13:27,021 --> 00:13:27,854
you should fear and Bert Kreischer hired
companies to take over their social 

293
00:13:31,421 --> 00:13:32,410
media.
Yeah,

294
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,000
they don't.
They don't look at their social media at

295
00:13:34,001 --> 00:13:34,834
all.
What they do is they'll post something 

296
00:13:36,131 --> 00:13:40,300
by sending it to them.
Like say if he has a tour coming up,

297
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:41,081
like,
hey,

298
00:13:41,081 --> 00:13:41,914
you know,
I'm going to be in Sacramento and Blah 

299
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:43,480
Blah Blah.

300
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,400
He sends it to them.
They take that,

301
00:13:45,401 --> 00:13:47,080
they put it up.
He doesn't see it at all.

302
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:49,780
He doesn't,
doesn't pay attention to a second of it.

303
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:50,830
That sort of stands?
No,

304
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:54,070
I'm thinking it does.
You know,

305
00:13:54,071 --> 00:13:54,904
I've been better at it over the last 
like couple months than I ever had 

306
00:13:58,511 --> 00:14:01,510
before.
But just leaving the phone alone and not

307
00:14:01,511 --> 00:14:03,400
touching it and just hanging out.
Yeah,

308
00:14:03,401 --> 00:14:05,740
I'll do certain posts where I don't even
look back on it.

309
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:09,420
Just like posted it,
the content out there.

310
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:10,283
People want to look at it,
they can look at it if they don't want 

311
00:14:11,231 --> 00:14:12,640
to look at it,
change the channel gun,

312
00:14:12,641 --> 00:14:13,474
look at something different.
But then every now and then there's one 

313
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:19,510
that I liked to look at the engagement 
with and stuff like that,

314
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,950
which is good.
But you know,

315
00:14:20,951 --> 00:14:24,040
there's always like there's 10 percent 
fuckwits out there that are kind of.

316
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,930
It's true.
There's like 10 percent.

317
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,460
So I've been looking at
how many followers you got,

318
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:33,940
like how many people would tune into an 
instagram posts of yours each day?

319
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,610
I don't know,
just a guess.

320
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,593
I have couple of hundred thousand at 
least I have five point $5 million 

321
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:42,603
instagram followers.
So say one percent of them wakes up on 

322
00:14:45,341 --> 00:14:46,174
the wrong side of the just one percent 
wakes up on the wrong side of the bed 

323
00:14:49,061 --> 00:14:51,580
and wants to be fucking mail fee that 
that's a lot of people.

324
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,160
And then your

325
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,480
post is the first post doc.
You'll see again,

326
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,333
I get some shit there and you know,
we're all ignorant if we think that 

327
00:14:57,861 --> 00:14:58,694
everyone's just going to get along.
Like that's never gonna fucking happen 

328
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:03,350
is it?
And it's never happened.

329
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:07,640
But I feel like it's getting worse,
really beer because there's,

330
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,860
you can't punch someone in the face 
anymore.

331
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,693
Like it's true if someone gets mouthy,
especially in Australia was only going 

332
00:15:15,171 --> 00:15:17,030
back so many years ago.
If someone gets mouthy,

333
00:15:17,031 --> 00:15:18,980
you confront them and if they want to go
at it,

334
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,220
it's going to all get in trouble.
If I do that,

335
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:24,530
now you know your,
the one that gets in trouble,

336
00:15:24,531 --> 00:15:27,560
even though there'll be an a smarter now
you're the one that gets in trouble.

337
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:29,270
So you can't do that.
And people know that.

338
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,163
So they get mafia.
There's no repercussions for calling 

339
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:34,170
someone a fucking cunt on

340
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,470
instagram.
That's true.

341
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,840
Like I'm not in favor of people running 
around punching people,

342
00:15:37,841 --> 00:15:41,230
but I am.
I do like the way it turns out,

343
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,320
other people realize.

344
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:49,850
Imagine like when you were in school and
say you don't get along with someone and

345
00:15:49,851 --> 00:15:53,020
they get mouthy and then you have a fire
usually ended up friends after it.

346
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,413
A lot of times,
a lot of the times you ended up friends 

347
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:59,320
over all mass beef he bought a lot of 
the times.

348
00:15:59,321 --> 00:16:01,360
It was just sorted out then and it was 
done,

349
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:02,443
you know?
And then other people knew not to talk 

350
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:05,164
shit.

351
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,073
Yeah.
Well it's a weird thing like when you 

352
00:16:07,191 --> 00:16:11,270
see UFC fights with guys fucking hate 
each other and they beat the shit out of

353
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,030
her hugging and.
Yeah.

354
00:16:14,031 --> 00:16:15,890
Yeah.
I know it's a weird thing with men,

355
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,620
like sometimes you just need to get it 
out of your system.

356
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,390
Yeah,
I think it's fucking,

357
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,253
it's primal.
It's human nature that it's definitely 

358
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:28,510
too easy to be shitty to people.
It's too easy and people do.

359
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,700
It's also so new.
The other thing is so new.

360
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,960
I mean any kind of internet interaction 
is only 20 years old.

361
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:39,740
That's it,
basically 24 years I think.

362
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,120
I think I was online in 94 and it was 
like a 56 k modem.

363
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:47,480
It was slow as shit.
My be 56 K,

364
00:16:47,481 --> 00:16:48,314
it might've been 14 four and it was a 
way you would use it through the phone 

365
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,140
line and go
hit highs,

366
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:59,060
but we photos great back then were like,
this is amazing.

367
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,470
We thought it was the most incredible 
thing.

368
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,680
I remember I showed up to news radio one
day,

369
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:04,543
the Sitcom that I was on and I couldn't 
wait to tell these people about how I 

370
00:17:07,191 --> 00:17:08,024
got online last night and I was 
downloading all these things and 

371
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,250
printing them,
printing up a,

372
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,320
uh,
it was all about Ufo was.

373
00:17:15,321 --> 00:17:16,154
I was really into Ufo Ufos back then.
And I was a reading all these files 

374
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:22,670
about UFO shows,
like government reports about Ufos.

375
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:27,170
I somehow or another found some,
I don't know what the fuck it was,

376
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:31,940
a message board or something that you
and I was so obsessed.

377
00:17:31,941 --> 00:17:34,120
I was telling them that was such a big 
deal.

378
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:37,430
It takes so long to download one piece 
of paper,

379
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,613
like one piece of paper that was filled 
with text would take like 30 seconds to 

380
00:17:42,231 --> 00:17:42,550
download.

381
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,110
Yeah,
crazy.

382
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,033
It's crazy.
And now we're here and I'm lucky I've 

383
00:17:46,451 --> 00:17:47,560
got three g,
four boss.

384
00:17:47,561 --> 00:17:48,490
I'm like,
what the fuck?

385
00:17:48,491 --> 00:17:48,600
Fuck

386
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,740
yeah,
I know you're mad.

387
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,660
It's like,
this is so slow.

388
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,340
Well,
what's a,

389
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,233
you know,
I was telling your kids about the 

390
00:17:55,381 --> 00:17:57,300
virtual reality setup that we have back 
there.

391
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:00,360
That disturbs me.
That disturbs me.

392
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,900
It did.
Doesn't disturb me that you know,

393
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:03,803
it's bad for you or anything like that.
It's so fun and it's so immersive and I 

394
00:18:07,891 --> 00:18:10,220
know and I know where it's going.
I'm like,

395
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,790
it's going to keep getting better and 
better.

396
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:12,624
Just like it was 30 seconds to download 
a just a simple piece of paper filled 

397
00:18:16,201 --> 00:18:17,550
with text,
you know,

398
00:18:17,551 --> 00:18:18,384
20 years ago,
20 years from now that is going to look 

399
00:18:21,121 --> 00:18:22,800
like crayons,
so I'll totally.

400
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,470
But that is the.
You got to put that thing on your own to

401
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,250
freak out.
There's some archery games to there.

402
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,130
A bunch of.
It's pretty cool.

403
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:32,250
You actually have a.
it's called haptic feedback.

404
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:33,443
So as you draw the bow back,
you actually feel like a vibration 

405
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,580
handling.
Yup.

406
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,320
Yup.
And then you let go like that.

407
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:43,130
Tesla suit Jesus Christ.
Tesla.

408
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,320
It's not the same company.
They're just calling it that.

409
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,110
Oh fuck you.
Other company.

410
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:54,690
Tesla suit on field and ces 2019 takes 
virtual reality to new heights.

411
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:55,883
Yeah.
They're going to have haptic feedback 

412
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:57,810
suits.
Is that what it is?

413
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,690
Yeah,
there's like 68 sensors in there and you

414
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:02,850
can supposedly feel like up to a grain,
I guess,

415
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:06,280
and put one rarely
cracks.

416
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,173
It wasn't going to put it right on their
posts and they're just going to keep 

417
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,233
shooting themselves.

418
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:16,260
You could have come home,
you'll your girls going to have a haptic

419
00:19:16,261 --> 00:19:18,750
feedback suit on and one of them 
artificial machine guns.

420
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:22,620
It's gonna wreck reality video of a girl
doing it

421
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,530
that she gets shocked.
No,

422
00:19:26,531 --> 00:19:28,220
but this was a couple of different 
things.

423
00:19:28,221 --> 00:19:29,054
This is just a test,
but she takes like a hard front kick to 

424
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,650
the chest here.
Yeah,

425
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,340
I mean I don't know how,
how it felt to her,

426
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,810
but.
Okay.

427
00:19:34,811 --> 00:19:36,590
Let's see.
Hard front kick to the chest.

428
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,150
Hot Explosion back here.
Actually I did it early.

429
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,240
Okay.
Oh she did.

430
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,570
Oh,
it's not that hard.

431
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:50,110
It's not your kid,
but I did feel it right here.

432
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:52,090
Hot Explosion.
Oh,

433
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:53,770
do I really want to try?
Yes I do.

434
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,370
What does a boxing game that you can 
play?

435
00:20:03,371 --> 00:20:05,150
It's really cool.
And uh,

436
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:08,380
the boxing game,
you see this guy in front of you,

437
00:20:08,381 --> 00:20:09,214
like a big three d cartoon really?
But really cool graphics and when he 

438
00:20:12,701 --> 00:20:14,860
punches you the whole screen goes 
bright.

439
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:18,940
Like you got your Bell Rung.
It makes you nervous.

440
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,100
Like when I'm,
when I'm sparring with him and he,

441
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,210
he punches me.
I'm like,

442
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,590
oh Jesus,
got to get my hands up.

443
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,110
And you get exhausted because you're 
moving around.

444
00:20:29,111 --> 00:20:29,944
You punching just it's harder.
Believe it or not to punch air then is 

445
00:20:34,001 --> 00:20:35,360
the punch something?
Oh definitely.

446
00:20:35,361 --> 00:20:35,921
Yeah.
Yeah,

447
00:20:35,921 --> 00:20:38,170
because you get tired,
you get tired easier.

448
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,740
So you throw in your hands at this thing
and you know you're.

449
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,280
And then she goes down.
You're like,

450
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:45,520
oh.
And it gets back up at your feet.

451
00:20:45,521 --> 00:20:46,354
Hurt from moving around,
squeaking on the floor and really 

452
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,200
interesting.

453
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:49,931
Yeah.
Yeah.

454
00:20:49,931 --> 00:20:54,931
So there's for sure going to be a weird 
world for our kids when they get to be,

455
00:20:56,861 --> 00:20:58,090
you know,
our age.

456
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,970
The world is going to be unrecognizable.
Yeah.

457
00:21:00,971 --> 00:21:04,440
I feel like it's taken the edge off 
things to it has it.

458
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,780
It really takes the edge off things like
you haven't actually done that.

459
00:21:07,781 --> 00:21:09,250
Like you haven't actually climbed 
Everest,

460
00:21:09,251 --> 00:21:10,084
but I sort of have.
I did it in a virtual reality game and 

461
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,290
not really.
He didn't have.

462
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,830
Your life wasn't at stake.
Yeah,

463
00:21:15,831 --> 00:21:16,664
exactly.
Yeah.

464
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:20,380
I've been actually talking about this on
stage that I'm worried about this.

465
00:21:20,381 --> 00:21:25,381
I'm worried about people being able to 
have experiences that they didn't earn.

466
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:26,830
You know,
like if,

467
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,170
if someone,
if,

468
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,063
if there's a virtual reality game where 
you play it and all of a sudden you're 

469
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:34,620
in a,
a nascar and you're,

470
00:21:34,621 --> 00:21:36,790
you know,
you're winning some gigantic race,

471
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:37,624
you're in the driver's seat and you're 
shifting the gears and you mean feels 

472
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:41,884
like you're like indiscernible from 
feeling like you're winning a race 

473
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:46,780
that's going to happen.

474
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,310
You're going to,
they're going to be able to do all these

475
00:21:48,311 --> 00:21:49,144
different things and it's gonna.
It's gonna make people more and more 

476
00:21:51,821 --> 00:21:55,180
dependent on technology and weaker and 
weaker and weaker and weaker.

477
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:57,240
That's how I feel too.
Yeah.

478
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,410
It's like,
um,

479
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:01,720
it's like going to the gym and working 
out and getting all of these muscles,

480
00:22:01,721 --> 00:22:04,900
but then moving away from any manual 
labor.

481
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,100
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

482
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,770
And not.
I'm not saying don't be fit,

483
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:12,820
but I'm saying if you'll build them,
muscles fucking use them.

484
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,190
That is true.
There's a lot of guys that go to the gym

485
00:22:15,191 --> 00:22:18,680
and they'll work out hard for 45 minutes
an hour to Jim,

486
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,533
but make them work.
A construction site carrying lumber all 

487
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:23,703
day,
dig.

488
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:26,650
That'd be fucking complainant for 
protein shakes.

489
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:31,330
And
the real problem is going to be sex.

490
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:33,190
Yeah,
that's a real problem.

491
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,770
You're gonna be able to put those things
on and have sex with anybody you want.

492
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:39,070
Like anybody Scarlett Johannsen.
It's fucking weed started.

493
00:22:39,071 --> 00:22:42,250
They're already doing these things where
they face swap with computers,

494
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:46,510
so they take beautiful actresses and 
they put their face on porn stars bodies

495
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:47,763
and it's hard to tell man.
I mean it looks like a sex tape with a 

496
00:22:51,641 --> 00:22:56,641
famous actress that's painted is 
disturbing on the Joe Rogan one.

497
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:58,763
Sure.
There is.

498
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,613
So there is now we mentioned that 
talking about it and it's probably the 

499
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:03,543
best thing that's ever lived,
but I think the real worry is that not 

500
00:23:06,821 --> 00:23:07,654
just like see it,
but do it like the to be able to like 

501
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:11,883
the matrix going to be able to put this 
on and you're going to be able to like 

502
00:23:14,261 --> 00:23:17,470
this haptic feedback suit.
That's just one step.

503
00:23:17,471 --> 00:23:18,304
Eventually they're going to figure out a
way to make your body feel it and then 

504
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:24,220
you're gonna you're gonna be able to 
have sex with people.

505
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:25,463
Don.
Yeah,

506
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,060
like anybody you want.
You're never going to have to be nice to

507
00:23:28,061 --> 00:23:30,140
people again because everybody's going 
to fuck you.

508
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,260
That's one of the.
One of my,

509
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:38,300
my point was Kinda onstage is that like 
one of the reasons why it's hard,

510
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:42,100
like it's hard to have sex with people,
like you have to plan it out.

511
00:23:42,101 --> 00:23:44,350
I mean it's not that hard,
but it's,

512
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,160
you know,
you have to agree

513
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,500
that you like each other,
you know,

514
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:50,540
you have to hope that she likes you and 
you like her or whatever,

515
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,770
and there's,
you develop your personality,

516
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,650
like to get people to like you more that
way.

517
00:23:57,651 --> 00:24:00,650
It's more likely be a nicer person.
You get rewarded for that.

518
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:01,161
You realize,
oh,

519
00:24:01,161 --> 00:24:01,994
it's nice to be a nice person and then 
it actually makes you a nicer person if 

520
00:24:04,521 --> 00:24:05,354
you don't have to do that in the future.
We're going to be able to dress in a 

521
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,140
certain why and Toronto,
Cape Hygienic and us.

522
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:12,163
And then everyone just turns into a 
fucking slaw because they're going to 

523
00:24:15,081 --> 00:24:17,020
sleep with some pretty actress.
Yeah.

524
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:20,270
And in that virtual reality,
they're going to look like Ryan Reynolds

525
00:24:20,271 --> 00:24:22,280
anyway.
You're going to have a full six pack and

526
00:24:22,281 --> 00:24:25,140
look beautiful and then other people are
going to meet you in there.

527
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:26,283
They're also going to be pretending 
you're going to have some disgusting 

528
00:24:28,731 --> 00:24:31,790
human beings and then in that world 
they're going to be perfect,

529
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:33,530
but innovative people like me that 
unlocked.

530
00:24:33,531 --> 00:24:35,810
Now I'm traditional sleep,
real,

531
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:37,520
real.
My wife,

532
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:38,443
real humans is.
That's going to be old school that's 

533
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,190
going to be like riding a bike.
What are you?

534
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,760
He walk everywhere.

535
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,650
It's crazy.
The ideas.

536
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:50,720
I posted a photo,
a video actually,

537
00:24:50,721 --> 00:24:54,650
which is like 700 images stacked 
together at at Joshua tree.

538
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:55,850
I saw that.
Yeah,

539
00:24:55,851 --> 00:24:57,800
and it's like the Milky White crews and 
pos,

540
00:24:57,801 --> 00:25:01,120
but then there's just the air traffic 
duties in sign.

541
00:25:01,121 --> 00:25:01,954
It's just like constant,
like anyone look at in this muscle 

542
00:25:06,051 --> 00:25:08,010
already look like the future,
you know,

543
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,550
look so futuristic already.
And I'm like,

544
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,413
well,
it sort of is maybe this like we're 

545
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,053
living in now.
Here it is of the air traffic at about 

546
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,510
this point here.
Look at them all just back and forth.

547
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,900
And that's all air traffic.
None of that is asteroids.

548
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:25,510
Every bit of that to air traffic.
Wow.

549
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,383
That's such an amazing management.
It wasn't until the cameras stopped 

550
00:25:28,851 --> 00:25:30,980
early hours in the morning.
That day is for anybody.

551
00:25:30,981 --> 00:25:31,814
This is Adam.green tree on instagram.
And you still have your photography 

552
00:25:35,151 --> 00:25:37,580
page,
first man image yet both Mandy image,

553
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,930
first.man image.

554
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:42,340
And these are some amazing photos.
Yeah.

555
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:46,490
So that's about 300 photos stack 
together.

556
00:25:46,491 --> 00:25:49,430
So you actually get a star trial that's 
in Australia.

557
00:25:49,431 --> 00:25:52,910
So that's the southern style,
you know that middle point.

558
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:58,250
So that's like the south.
And then if you go back to a,

559
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,770
if you go back to Adam dog,
greentree Jamie,

560
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:06,550
that one
if you go back to like

561
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:12,020
that style on that's the north style.
So that was pretty cool.

562
00:26:12,021 --> 00:26:14,390
So one's taken from Australia where you 
got the southern style,

563
00:26:14,391 --> 00:26:18,740
which is like the turning point and then
this is from America,

564
00:26:18,741 --> 00:26:19,574
like Joshua Tree there,
California and that's like the northern 

565
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:22,363
star.
I think Joshua trees closed down right 

566
00:26:23,931 --> 00:26:28,931
now because of the people liked it.
The federal shutdown affect you at all.

567
00:26:28,971 --> 00:26:29,571
I'm like,
no,

568
00:26:29,571 --> 00:26:32,030
I didn't even know about it until you 
mentioned it just then.

569
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,340
Yeah,
it's a.

570
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,020
it's going to be awhile to really.

571
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,100
Yeah,
they didn't,

572
00:26:37,101 --> 00:26:40,490
they shut down Joshua Tree because 
people were shutting their,

573
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,333
were chopping trees down.
It wasn't just because of the trash 

574
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,184
that's it started because the trash and 
then over the last week people were 

575
00:26:46,111 --> 00:26:49,680
actually going in and like chopping some
trees down like super assholes.

576
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,243
So they was signed.
They will have signs up that it was 

577
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:56,010
closed and I wasn't actually canteen 
Joshua tree itself.

578
00:26:56,011 --> 00:26:56,844
I was like out of the tourist section 
just off the side of the road where I 

579
00:26:59,431 --> 00:27:01,380
could,
but some,

580
00:27:01,381 --> 00:27:03,450
almost signing about,
um,

581
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,360
you know,
that the government or whatever,

582
00:27:06,361 --> 00:27:07,800
the federal government,
you know,

583
00:27:07,801 --> 00:27:09,900
we've all the trash,
but the federal government's not leaving

584
00:27:09,901 --> 00:27:10,734
the fucking trash day.
That's people signature trees are among 

585
00:27:13,321 --> 00:27:15,810
the shutdown.
Wow.

586
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,740
There's only a few trees in Joshua tree 
and these people were chopping them down

587
00:27:19,741 --> 00:27:21,810
just to be dicks because they know 
there's no one there.

588
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:23,503
They probably turned it from A.
There's just probably trying to be 

589
00:27:26,641 --> 00:27:28,500
assholes.
God Damn it.

590
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,140
And that,
that has failed.

591
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:32,490
Joshua tree is a massive place.
Two,

592
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,950
it says there,
it's larger than Rhode Island.

593
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,450
Yeah,
it's beautiful.

594
00:27:36,451 --> 00:27:38,450
Once you get out of there,
that's a real shine.

595
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,583
This is the thing about people that 
don't spend much time in the wilderness 

596
00:27:42,421 --> 00:27:44,430
and don't appreciate the wilderness.
They don't.

597
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,293
They don't.
They just,

598
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,460
well,
they're not connected to it.

599
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,313
They don't understand.
So I had a bunch of people in the city 

600
00:27:48,931 --> 00:27:52,600
because I spent the last five,
six days here in La and the bad wave has

601
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,311
come in.
They're like,

602
00:27:53,311 --> 00:27:54,270
Oh,
this is disgusting,

603
00:27:54,271 --> 00:27:54,901
whatever,
and I'm like,

604
00:27:54,901 --> 00:27:57,300
fuck no,
the Bush is loving this.

605
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,250
The herbs,
loving this.

606
00:27:59,251 --> 00:28:00,084
You'd need rain,
especially after all these horrible 

607
00:28:01,741 --> 00:28:04,830
fires that you had.
Like Ryan's a good thing.

608
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,440
They just so complaining out here.

609
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,070
Literally 10 days a year,
10 days a year as normal.

610
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:13,260
Yeah.
I mean it might be exaggerating,

611
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:17,310
I might be exaggerating,
but slightly slightly like I wouldn't.

612
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:20,010
I don't imagine it rains more than 50 
days a year out here.

613
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:22,110
That's.
No,

614
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,270
that's not exaggerating and it's 10.
It's probably about right.

615
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:26,943
Since I've lived here,
might be a little more of the drought 

616
00:28:28,621 --> 00:28:29,790
time,
but let's take a guess.

617
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,160
How many days a year on average does it 
written in la?

618
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:35,190
I'm going to say 25,
25 days a year.

619
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:37,080
16.
16.

620
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,850
I bet you're right.
That's two per month.

621
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:40,140
That's a lot.
Yeah,

622
00:28:40,141 --> 00:28:40,974
but sometimes there's a bunch together.
Like this is like seven already so far 

623
00:28:44,401 --> 00:28:46,160
in the last week and a half.
Let's bet on it.

624
00:28:46,161 --> 00:28:48,450
I'll bet you that Kanye idol.
No fucking way,

625
00:28:48,451 --> 00:28:50,550
Bro.
Shout out to

626
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,560
shout out to plastic,
so that's cool.

627
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:00,330
For this dope ass Kanye West.
Dol says rain days is 35.

628
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,830
Damn.
Thirty five.

629
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:04,230
You'll close her.
You can keep this.

630
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,060
It's tough to get.

631
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,700
I should have luck and greedy for sunny 
days per year.

632
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,750
Just means.
Yeah.

633
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:13,880
I don't know.
30 nine inches per year.

634
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,050
It's tough to figure that out.
Thirty nine inches per year is not a lot

635
00:29:18,051 --> 00:29:19,300
though,
so that.

636
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:21,110
But the.
The problem is California,

637
00:29:21,111 --> 00:29:21,944
right?
It's like northern California fucking 

638
00:29:23,151 --> 00:29:23,984
rains every day.
I'll give you go like near the redwood 

639
00:29:26,511 --> 00:29:27,540
before us.
That's a.

640
00:29:27,541 --> 00:29:28,620
that's a rainforest.
Yeah.

641
00:29:28,621 --> 00:29:30,470
Yeah.
It was raining constantly.

642
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,980
We spent some time up in medicine.
No,

643
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:37,250
it's beautiful for the ocean.
Fucking trees are so big.

644
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,220
They're stupid.
Doesn't even trees as big as this room.

645
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,500
Yeah.
You're standing there going,

646
00:29:41,501 --> 00:29:42,760
how old is this?
Oh,

647
00:29:42,761 --> 00:29:45,950
this is a 2000 year old tree.
You're in a desert stretch.

648
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:49,840
A thousand year old tree is like a 
normal tree up there.

649
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:54,040
I've noticed around the city there's a 
lot of Australian natives like gum trees

650
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:55,750
and eucalyptus and stuff like that.

651
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,593
Yeah.
They must have been important at some 

652
00:29:58,241 --> 00:30:01,000
point and just realize I do well in the 
harsh conditions.

653
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:01,421
Well,
you know,

654
00:30:01,421 --> 00:30:05,470
the palm trees is sort of the Hollywood 
signature trivia shifts from Hawaii,

655
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,510
but I look good but it's just so funny 
that like,

656
00:30:10,511 --> 00:30:13,240
that sort of indicative of what 
California is like.

657
00:30:13,241 --> 00:30:16,120
We don't,
we don't have a real,

658
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:17,740
you know,
just the diversity.

659
00:30:17,741 --> 00:30:19,810
I mean everything comes from somewhere 
else here.

660
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,170
There's no like native Los Angeles 
people.

661
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:25,000
You meet one of those and you're like,
Whoa,

662
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:28,220
you're a test tube baby?
Or say away from rock.

663
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:32,820
Rocking Disneyland do
is goofy.

664
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:35,680
Yeah.
What's it like wandering around there?

665
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:36,603
That's hectic.
So especially like because everything 

666
00:30:38,861 --> 00:30:41,320
got to do is like wilderness and out.
Like I adapt.

667
00:30:41,321 --> 00:30:42,790
Fine,
like that's not an issue,

668
00:30:42,791 --> 00:30:44,660
but I don't like it just because I 
adapt.

669
00:30:44,661 --> 00:30:48,460
It doesn't mean I like it,
but I'm days needs a different place.

670
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:51,250
Like I went in there yesterday like 
fucking dressed as a man,

671
00:30:51,251 --> 00:30:53,790
you know,
jeans on a flannelette shirt,

672
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,700
you know,
Kemo cap and walking around and then the

673
00:30:57,701 --> 00:31:01,570
kids talked me into going to that.
What's the splash mountain mountain.

674
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:04,030
And my eldest is like sitting in the 
front,

675
00:31:04,031 --> 00:31:07,060
that is the place you want to get so wet
in the front.

676
00:31:07,061 --> 00:31:07,960
And I'm like okay,
cool.

677
00:31:07,961 --> 00:31:10,510
And I jumped in the front.
We come down and I'm like,

678
00:31:10,511 --> 00:31:12,170
I'm fucking yelling.
So my mouth is,

679
00:31:12,171 --> 00:31:16,830
I've been doing,
I know he fucking drowned that module at

680
00:31:16,831 --> 00:31:17,291
all.
I'm like,

681
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:18,370
fuck,
I've got aids.

682
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:22,090
Vishal.
So a whole Gollup went in the mail,

683
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,103
fucking so drench me.
And then it was called dude come of the 

684
00:31:26,591 --> 00:31:27,424
club.
So I've walked around Disney for the 

685
00:31:29,201 --> 00:31:31,600
bone and thinking like,
look at these fucking fruit loops in the

686
00:31:31,601 --> 00:31:34,700
way they're dressed in all the Disney 
close 90 clothes you can buy in.

687
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,533
There's fucking Disney clothes.
I'm wearing Pajama pants with fucking 

688
00:31:39,941 --> 00:31:40,774
mickey mouse's head all over this 
fucking this shirt that's got Disney 

689
00:31:44,531 --> 00:31:45,364
fucking written all over it.
Fucking walking around there like I 

690
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:48,823
fitted perfectly in after that and it's 
like fucking actually look like fucking 

691
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:55,870
who's the owner of Disney?
Walt Disney had fucking shot.

692
00:31:55,871 --> 00:31:56,704
He's load or load
mickey mouse and she load me while we 

693
00:32:00,491 --> 00:32:01,324
were there the other day.
They have a warming stations set up 

694
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,593
outside of a splash mountain where you 
can step into this like it looks like a 

695
00:32:08,201 --> 00:32:10,960
phone booth and you get warmed up,
but it costs money.

696
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,800
Everything costs money and Disney.
I'm like,

697
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:17,140
Jesus Christ,
you can't get people wet to dry off.

698
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,630
Crazy and
yeah,

699
00:32:19,631 --> 00:32:23,530
I think it's all fucking beautiful skin.
It is,

700
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:27,550
but let me tell you
100 percent.

701
00:32:27,551 --> 00:32:30,700
My kids went mental on those roads.
Have you been to Florida yet?

702
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,860
Yeah,
six years ago I went to Florida.

703
00:32:32,861 --> 00:32:36,250
Yet when you go to Florida again,
you got to go to Disney world.

704
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,470
Disney world.
The world is way better than I think

705
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,083
we ended up going there.
Say it's way better because Disneyland 

706
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,453
is pretty amazing,
but Disney world has the best ride of 

707
00:32:45,951 --> 00:32:48,380
all time.
They have this Avatar ride.

708
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:52,130
What is it called?
Flight to flight to pass,

709
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:55,220
right,
and you ride one of them avatar dragons.

710
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:58,200
It's all virtual reality.
You put these goggles on you,

711
00:32:58,201 --> 00:33:01,640
you climb on this thing that looks like 
a motorcycle and it's traps you in place

712
00:33:01,641 --> 00:33:04,610
and what you're writing is one of them.
Giant dragons.

713
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:10,610
It's fucking incredible.
Dude is the best ride of all types and a

714
00:33:10,611 --> 00:33:13,880
bunch of friends there and I get text 
messages back from like,

715
00:33:13,881 --> 00:33:15,890
holy fucking shit.
I'm like,

716
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:18,150
yeah,
Joe,

717
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:21,620
you feel the breeze.
You smell things there.

718
00:33:21,621 --> 00:33:23,750
You see these animals,
you're flying over.

719
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:26,240
It's wild.
It's all hd.

720
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,960
Three dimensional.
Amazing.

721
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:30,140
God.
Damn,

722
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,370
it's good.
And now let's take the hunting and

723
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:37,160
at the end of the day,
Steve Rinella said it best.

724
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:38,503
This is a.
This is a quote that he said that I 

725
00:33:40,071 --> 00:33:42,590
think he was talking about.
Someone else told him this,

726
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,693
that there's two different kinds of fun.
This fun that you have while it's 

727
00:33:47,001 --> 00:33:49,000
happening,
like your ride the rollercoaster.

728
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:49,963
It's fun,
but you don't look back on that five 

729
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:54,690
years from now and go,
that was amazing,

730
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:57,980
but then there's things that suck while 
you're doing them.

731
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,053
Like your 28 day trip in the rocky 
mountains pointing a gun that you don't 

732
00:34:02,901 --> 00:34:07,820
even know has a jammed bulleted and 
grizzlies charging at you like that will

733
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:10,410
be fun for the rest of your lot.
Toggle.

734
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,253
Yeah.
Yeah.

735
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,060
You'll feel that when you bring it back,
when you talk about it,

736
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,810
there's like cello fun.
Oh,

737
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:18,860
it's some things that just shallow,
but they cool to do.

738
00:34:18,861 --> 00:34:22,300
There's nothing wrong with doing them,
but they just did not.

739
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:25,160
Real meaningful example and then this 
shit that you do,

740
00:34:25,161 --> 00:34:26,670
this is really meaningful.
You know,

741
00:34:26,671 --> 00:34:27,504
it builds character.
It's something that you'll always look 

742
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:29,774
back on memories and shit,
but this feelings that you get when you 

743
00:34:32,001 --> 00:34:32,834
come back to when you appreciate things 
like a Calvin and I did this trip with 

744
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:37,574
Rinella in.
I'm a Prince of Wales and we were up 

745
00:34:40,491 --> 00:34:41,324
there for.
We were supposed to be up there I think 

746
00:34:44,271 --> 00:34:47,570
for seven days,
but on the six day a storm was coming in

747
00:34:47,571 --> 00:34:48,404
and so we wound up bailing early because
I had a Gig in two days and otherwise I 

748
00:34:52,221 --> 00:34:53,720
would've been stuck up.
They're like,

749
00:34:53,721 --> 00:34:54,554
you get stuck.
It rained every fucking day and it 

750
00:34:56,751 --> 00:34:58,970
didn't just rain every day.
It rained all day.

751
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,740
Every day.
There was no,

752
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:02,060
there was like,
if you had a break,

753
00:35:02,061 --> 00:35:03,880
it was a five minute break,
like with the,

754
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:04,970
Oh look,
the sun.

755
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:08,060
And then just real misery.
So inside the,

756
00:35:08,061 --> 00:35:09,050
um,
the tent,

757
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:14,600
I put my headlamp on and there was it.
See this is what fucks you up.

758
00:35:14,601 --> 00:35:15,680
You said you think,
well,

759
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:18,590
when I'm inside the 10 I'll be dry.
No,

760
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:21,100
no,
there's no dry because the Arabs went,

761
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:23,330
eh.
When I turned my head lamp on,

762
00:35:23,331 --> 00:35:24,164
I realized the entire inside of the tent
was moisture particles floating around 

763
00:35:28,191 --> 00:35:29,450
the air.
And I was like,

764
00:35:29,451 --> 00:35:32,960
fuck me,
I'm in this wet down bag and I'm looking

765
00:35:32,961 --> 00:35:33,381
around.
I'm like,

766
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:37,400
you never going to get dry bro,
but you know,

767
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:41,220
you accept it.
But then when we came home after the six

768
00:35:41,221 --> 00:35:42,054
days and I took a shower and then I was,
we were in the car and it was sunny out 

769
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,530
and I was like,
God,

770
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:52,290
this is the best I've ever felt.
I'm so happy.

771
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,590
I don't think you get that happy unless 
you feel.

772
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,400
Yeah.
So you know,

773
00:35:57,401 --> 00:35:58,990
the misery and then so,
you know,

774
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:00,970
the little things that we take for 
granted in life.

775
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:02,950
Every dialogue.
Fucking wow.

776
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:06,440
Yeah.
Kim Did this hike in Montana with man.

777
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:07,303
It's just like,
it's like 14 malls and it's just like 

778
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:10,443
not a flat bit of ground on it.
It's just continually going up and it's 

779
00:36:12,581 --> 00:36:16,680
in the snow and she,
she had an issue with the leg and uh,

780
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:18,123
anyway,
we got up at the top and we set up camp 

781
00:36:19,451 --> 00:36:21,820
and she's been miserable.
But even a fire there,

782
00:36:21,821 --> 00:36:22,654
you know,
luckily we lit the fire and she's 

783
00:36:23,411 --> 00:36:25,390
fucking smile and she's loving it,
you know?

784
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,430
And then we come back to the trial.
I like,

785
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,273
we're not even in the house.
He was just traveling around in like a 

786
00:36:30,701 --> 00:36:31,534
winnebago tribe.
And we get back to the trailer and you 

787
00:36:33,761 --> 00:36:34,594
get to flick a lot on and turn the tap 
on and it's hot water and she's just 

788
00:36:37,511 --> 00:36:38,740
like,
fuck it,

789
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,970
I'm going to wake up by.
And then you start taking that sheet for

790
00:36:42,971 --> 00:36:44,770
granted again.
Some people do anyway,

791
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,130
but you certainly can.
But I think a got,

792
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:48,983
like you,
you're in the wilderness so often that 

793
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,520
it's almost like you have a permanent 
appreciation from.

794
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,190
Oh totally.
Yeah.

795
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:57,283
I actually miss it.
I actually don't like this started life 

796
00:36:59,871 --> 00:37:02,540
as much as that sort of life.
I see it,

797
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,520
I get it.
I like both.

798
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:08,330
Obviously I'd need.
I mean I make a living in cities.

799
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:08,920
Yeah.
Yeah.

800
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,850
Oh for sure.
Yeah.

801
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,410
That's what I do.
But.

802
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:16,460
But it's nice to go out and dabble in it
and come back out of it 100 percent.

803
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,240
Love it.
Those,

804
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:18,861
the,
the,

805
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:19,694
the few hunting trips that I get to do a
year when I'm out in the actual 

806
00:37:22,881 --> 00:37:23,714
wilderness wilderness,
like we're in the mountains of Utah elk 

807
00:37:26,481 --> 00:37:27,314
hunting.
I was like sitting down sometimes just 

808
00:37:29,301 --> 00:37:30,134
sit,
just sit down and take it all in for a 

809
00:37:31,221 --> 00:37:32,460
couple of minutes.
I mean,

810
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,313
even though you're in the middle of it 
and you're running around looking for 

811
00:37:35,031 --> 00:37:37,330
elk and you hear him,
I just like quiet.

812
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,650
Oh,
it's the best.

813
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,070
You thought you thought.

814
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,463
Knowing Yourself,
knowing the wilderness in the real 

815
00:37:44,141 --> 00:37:44,971
world,
you know,

816
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,630
it's like.
Because you always say,

817
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:47,543
I see you said on one of the podcasts,
I don't know if it was one with me or 

818
00:37:49,241 --> 00:37:50,074
someone else that it's so funny that we 
say the outdoors because everything's 

819
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,673
outdoors.
Like fucking everything's under the 

820
00:37:55,421 --> 00:37:56,560
ceiling of the,
you know,

821
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:57,423
that's what it really is,
but it's so weird that you don't really 

822
00:38:01,061 --> 00:38:01,894
know the outdoors and unless you stay 
out in the wilderness or something like 

823
00:38:04,331 --> 00:38:04,670
that.

824
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:05,670
Yeah.
Unless you're.

825
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,250
And I think also being out there at 
night,

826
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,180
at night by the campfire and you hear 
things like,

827
00:38:12,181 --> 00:38:14,550
what was that?
Yeah.

828
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,053
He just seems.
And the campfire somehow or another 

829
00:38:17,491 --> 00:38:18,324
seems to be able to protect you.
Most animals don't want to fuck with 

830
00:38:20,851 --> 00:38:23,040
campfires.
Yeah.

831
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,190
May I took,
came in,

832
00:38:27,191 --> 00:38:29,200
the kids we traveled around Australia 
are in,

833
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:34,670
it must've been the end of 2007 and 
early last year and we camped out on the

834
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:36,303
desert,
which is like one of the last places to 

835
00:38:37,421 --> 00:38:39,640
really be discovered and explored in 
Australia.

836
00:38:39,641 --> 00:38:40,474
Like there's,
there's no artificial lights out there 

837
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,400
at all whatsoever.
And we camped out on the desert.

838
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:50,080
90 thing that was around us was like 
dingoes and camels,

839
00:38:50,081 --> 00:38:52,390
like you'd hear them moving for the.
Not Camels.

840
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:52,931
Yeah.
Yeah.

841
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:55,550
But we sat there at camp.
I just had the,

842
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,160
my,
my truck,

843
00:38:57,161 --> 00:38:58,220
my ute,
you know,

844
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,520
with the camper on the back,
like rule lightweight,

845
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,660
set up and we sat there no lights on in 
the camper or anything.

846
00:39:04,661 --> 00:39:07,030
So you see it in the pitch black 
moonless not.

847
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:11,460
And the media's dude like I when we 
counted 40,

848
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:16,510
50 media's over like half hour an hour.
Just say an imperfect dude sitting there

849
00:39:17,951 --> 00:39:19,690
with the family and I'm like,
this is,

850
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,600
this is the best.
Like this is.

851
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:22,773
It was so amazing just to sit there,
especially with the kids and Kim as 

852
00:39:25,091 --> 00:39:25,820
well.

853
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:26,653
Nerving,
when you find out how many times they 

854
00:39:27,881 --> 00:39:28,714
enter the atmosphere.

855
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,090
Oh yeah,
there's a,

856
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,980
I think Jamie could probably look this 
up,

857
00:39:32,981 --> 00:39:37,981
but I think a hundred tons of media hits
the Earth every single day.

858
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:41,500
One hundred tons,
dude.

859
00:39:41,501 --> 00:39:44,260
But most of it enters in dusk for 
because it breaks up.

860
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:47,530
But uh,
so last year,

861
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:48,983
um,
all this up at my cabin just chilling 

862
00:39:50,501 --> 00:39:52,000
out by myself.
Woke up in the morning,

863
00:39:52,001 --> 00:39:52,834
they to do a piece,
walked out and I'm looking up and this 

864
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:56,434
media come through and it was so bright 
that it actually lead up the ground 

865
00:39:59,441 --> 00:40:01,930
dude,
like the most incredible media that I've

866
00:40:01,931 --> 00:40:02,764
seen.
I had a time lapse photo going in the 

867
00:40:04,751 --> 00:40:08,230
opposite direction.
I quickly turned that around and you say

868
00:40:08,231 --> 00:40:11,860
that the media is dust it last for 25 
minutes,

869
00:40:11,861 --> 00:40:12,694
half an hour in the,
into the camera and it's just drift and 

870
00:40:15,001 --> 00:40:17,660
change in shape in the atmosphere.
It was in sign.

871
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:21,160
So it's just like every now and then is 
like a real good one.

872
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:23,680
So then I started looking it up and I 
seen one that rick,

873
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:27,130
a whole village like in Germany or 
something like that.

874
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:31,850
This asteroid comes through rec and 
sheet that it didn't even touched,

875
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,793
but that comes so close to it.
It blows the walls and the windows out 

876
00:40:35,411 --> 00:40:36,370
and everything.
And I'm like,

877
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:40,810
this is fucking scary.
We live on a little speck that's turning

878
00:40:40,811 --> 00:40:42,570
in one of many galaxy.
You know,

879
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:43,663
my friend Randall Carlson put it best.
He said we live in the middle of a 

880
00:40:45,741 --> 00:40:48,070
shooting gallery,
isn't in science.

881
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:50,690
It's just the time,
the perspective of,

882
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,580
you know,
hundreds of millions of years.

883
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,833
It doesn't seem to.
It doesn't register to us because we're 

884
00:40:56,211 --> 00:40:57,670
only around for a hundred years.
Yeah.

885
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,660
Yeah.
So when we look up and we see the moon,

886
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:03,800
I mean the moon looks like a fucking 
stop sign in the most.

887
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:09,370
Janky is redneck town.
When people shoot it signs,

888
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:14,270
it looks like it's just fucking shot.
It's just getting nailed.

889
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:15,860
All,
especially with no atmosphere.

890
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,810
All those things make it all the way 
through.

891
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:20,810
Nothing gets slowed down by the air or 
burns up in the atmosphere.

892
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,150
Isn't that crazy how everything just 
slams into it.

893
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:24,380
Boom,
boom,

894
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:25,370
boom.
Magic being up there.

895
00:41:25,371 --> 00:41:27,990
It must be all day long.
I must be slamming things.

896
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:31,240
It was only,
I think it was like 10,000 years ago.

897
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:32,740
There was like a big bang,
like,

898
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:37,930
like a big media hit hit the earth.
And I started looking into that and then

899
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,710
I started really looking into average in
Australia,

900
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,553
indigenous,
how long they've been around for and 

901
00:41:44,571 --> 00:41:45,404
stuff like that.
And there's now evidence decided that 

902
00:41:47,541 --> 00:41:48,374
they'd been around for 70,000 years.
They live through like three of those 

903
00:41:51,441 --> 00:41:53,870
big media is hitting the earth,
you know,

904
00:41:53,871 --> 00:41:56,090
like,
it's crazy to think about like,

905
00:41:56,091 --> 00:41:58,100
why do I wish we had video cameras back 
in,

906
00:41:58,101 --> 00:41:59,330
you know,
and I could have recorded that.

907
00:41:59,331 --> 00:42:01,100
We could look at it now like imagine 
that.

908
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:02,400
Well Randall

909
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,080
crossing the guy that I talked about 
earlier,

910
00:42:04,081 --> 00:42:04,914
he is a proponent of this theory that 
this is what ended the ice age and he's 

911
00:42:10,531 --> 00:42:14,970
got some pretty compelling evidence to 
back it up in terms of um,

912
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:16,703
like massive,
massive fields filled with dead woolly 

913
00:42:20,641 --> 00:42:24,090
mammoths and died almost instantly.
Some of them with their legs broken from

914
00:42:24,091 --> 00:42:26,430
the force of the impact on.
Yeah,

915
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,760
he's,
you know,

916
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:30,180
it's really interesting because he's a 
guy who,

917
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,240
I don't think he has a degree in this 
stuff,

918
00:42:33,241 --> 00:42:34,074
but he's so well read in it that he has 
these debates and conversations with 

919
00:42:37,381 --> 00:42:42,060
people that do have these degrees in it 
and he can tell them things about it and

920
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:42,953
it's hard in those fields to be taken 
seriously if you don't have a phd in 

921
00:42:46,921 --> 00:42:49,170
whatever discipline it is.
But man,

922
00:42:49,171 --> 00:42:50,004
his uh,
his work on these things is so 

923
00:42:52,441 --> 00:42:56,010
compelling and the podcast that I've did
with them or just mind blowing,

924
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,053
but in,
in terms of like the evidence that 

925
00:42:58,021 --> 00:42:58,854
points to some event that ended the ice 
age very rapidly and caused the 

926
00:43:03,841 --> 00:43:08,160
disintegration of the pole of the,
the ice that was over North America.

927
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,353
North America had something like a mile 
high plus sheet device over the of it 

928
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:14,430
just 10,000 years ago.

929
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:15,890
Twelve thousand years old,
I think.

930
00:43:15,891 --> 00:43:16,724
I was driving through Wyoming and 
they've got all these signs up in 

931
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:23,450
Wyoming that a really interesting and it
was desert rock formation.

932
00:43:23,451 --> 00:43:26,150
It'll tell you how all of that rock 
formation is,

933
00:43:26,151 --> 00:43:27,380
how it formed,
you know,

934
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:28,243
because like,
you know,

935
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:32,390
rock usually embeds in layers like this.
It's formed in layers like this and then

936
00:43:32,391 --> 00:43:34,150
you'll see a rock like that,
you know,

937
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:34,993
all the lines of like this,
that some of them there that are like 

938
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:40,160
hundreds of million years old,
you know,

939
00:43:40,161 --> 00:43:40,994
and there's a song on and it's just,
it's incredible to think how much 

940
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:47,630
they've changed and you just said it 
were around for a hundred years of a ton

941
00:43:47,631 --> 00:43:49,100
Max,
you know,

942
00:43:49,101 --> 00:43:52,160
and it's just like we're dropping the 
freaking ocean.

943
00:43:52,161 --> 00:43:55,850
Like even the whole human race is a drop
in the ocean compared to what,

944
00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:57,163
how old the earth is.
And it's just crazy to think of like 

945
00:43:59,751 --> 00:44:00,584
it's hard to comprehend that they was at
my choice over here because there's not 

946
00:44:02,601 --> 00:44:03,480
now,
you know,

947
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:06,290
but it's been that long,
you know,

948
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,180
nuts.
Yeah.

949
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,440
It's mind boggling to think of.
Well,

950
00:44:09,441 --> 00:44:12,440
they,
they find shells in Montana.

951
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:13,543
I found some on top of Friggen.
Some big mice are out in the desert 

952
00:44:16,791 --> 00:44:17,624
dude.
Like there's no water for miles and 

953
00:44:18,891 --> 00:44:19,950
there's shells.
There's,

954
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:24,950
it was like starfish fossilized in the 
rocks and it's all like Carl bed,

955
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:25,940
you know,
and that was like,

956
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,460
that was like the bottom of the ocean.
That was a reef bed.

957
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,880
Yeah.
As the great western inland.

958
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:32,160
Yeah.

959
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,390
They had sharks out there I think.
I think they had mega dawns in Montana.

960
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:39,180
Shit,
they find dinosaurs there all the time.

961
00:44:39,181 --> 00:44:40,014
One a Dudley's friends.
Well Dudley knows a guy who has a ranch 

962
00:44:43,261 --> 00:44:47,280
out there in Montana and he found a bone
in his,

963
00:44:47,281 --> 00:44:48,510
uh,
in his ranch,

964
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,344
just maybe something protruding from the
ground and he wanted someone to get a 

965
00:44:53,551 --> 00:44:55,770
look at it.
So he got ahold to some,

966
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,400
I guess what would you have 
paleontologist?

967
00:44:58,401 --> 00:45:01,290
So they went and they said,
you gotta fucking t here,

968
00:45:01,291 --> 00:45:03,840
Bro.
I'll only rex on your property.

969
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,370
Unbelievable.
They,

970
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:07,650
I think they gave him a million dollars 
for it really,

971
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:11,790
because is a fully intact or close to 
intact t-rex.

972
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,030
Far Out.
Yeah.

973
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:13,873
They apparently Montera Place Colorado 
Mengele Donald was found supposedly 

974
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,460
Texas.
Jesus Christ.

975
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,950
What the fuck?
That's fucking great.

976
00:45:22,951 --> 00:45:23,940
What?
Shock boy,

977
00:45:23,941 --> 00:45:28,350
that's a stupid movie.
The Meg meg watch that shit.

978
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:29,910
I watched it the other day.
I could.

979
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:33,050
I was like,
what am I sit in through here?

980
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:36,420
Stupid.
There wasn't just one.

981
00:45:36,421 --> 00:45:38,220
There was a bunch of them.
Did get lawyer.

982
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,850
Can you find out how much,
how much media?

983
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:43,760
Yeah,
I have.

984
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:47,780
I was struggling to find that and then I
think I found what you found.

985
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:50,300
So it says,
here's from NASA's website,

986
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:55,220
there's 100 tons of dust and sand sized 
particle every day.

987
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:58,580
Hit Earth every day,
but every day it seems like it would put

988
00:45:58,581 --> 00:46:00,630
the balance of the earth off,
you know,

989
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:01,493
like you know what I mean?
Like are we sending shit back out into 

990
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:04,763
space and we send them 100 tons of shit 
back at in the spice everyday to off 

991
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,050
load this.
Look at this.

992
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:09,780
Every two years,

993
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:10,613
a thousand years or so,
immediate meteoroid the size of a 

994
00:46:12,961 --> 00:46:17,460
football field hits earth and caused 
significant damage to the area.

995
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:18,633
That's scary.
Once every faculty in the next 10 

996
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:21,444
minutes and object large enough to 
threaten earth's civilization comes 

997
00:46:23,761 --> 00:46:24,594
along.
Not just that bigger than that impact 

998
00:46:26,971 --> 00:46:27,804
craters on earth.
The moon and other planetary planetary 

999
00:46:29,431 --> 00:46:31,440
bodies are evidence of these 
occurrences.

1000
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:32,570
Yeah.
They don't even know.

1001
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:35,130
You know,
that's the most spooky thing.

1002
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,113
Like Neil degrasse Tyson said that we 
are decades away from being able to do 

1003
00:46:41,101 --> 00:46:43,230
anything about one of those things 
coming our way,

1004
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:45,870
and I said,
so all these people that think that they

1005
00:46:45,871 --> 00:46:48,420
could stop it when it's happening,
it's not happening.

1006
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:50,010
He goes,
there's nothing you could do.

1007
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:51,180
What about Armageddon,
Bro?

1008
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:53,340
The Bruce Willis?
Yeah.

1009
00:46:53,341 --> 00:46:55,500
We've got solar swells up there.
He'll figure it out.

1010
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:56,440
Sort that.
Yeah.

1011
00:46:56,770 --> 00:46:57,630
Yeah.
There's a.

1012
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:02,750
people have a real distorted idea of the
technological capabilities in terms of.

1013
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:04,651
First of all,
NASA,

1014
00:47:04,651 --> 00:47:05,484
so under budgeted,
they barely have enough money to put 

1015
00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:09,263
satellites in orbit.
They don't have enough money to stop 

1016
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:11,663
asking me coming in and mean the amount 
of money you would need is so fucking 

1017
00:47:14,521 --> 00:47:17,430
massive.
It would take a cooperative joint effort

1018
00:47:17,431 --> 00:47:21,300
of every major country in the world is 
such a force of nature,

1019
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:25,890
a force of nature.
You usually can't be fucked with scary.

1020
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:26,431
Well,
they're all.

1021
00:47:26,431 --> 00:47:29,980
They can do all they think they could do
in the and not

1022
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:30,813
even now,
but in the future is move it off target 

1023
00:47:32,951 --> 00:47:35,710
slightly to somehow or another,
give it a bump,

1024
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:39,670
send it into Mars or something at a 
certain distance and completely misses.

1025
00:47:39,671 --> 00:47:40,504
Yeah.
Cracks and noon instead of darkness to 

1026
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:46,060
light for forever.
Yeah.

1027
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:50,920
It's scary spaces scary and you don't 
really see space unless you're out there

1028
00:47:50,921 --> 00:47:53,020
with no light pollution,
you know the,

1029
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:56,800
I don't think people that don't camp or 
that you don't go,

1030
00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:58,510
you know,
you look up at night,

1031
00:47:58,511 --> 00:47:59,344
like last night,
well not last night but a couple of 

1032
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:02,344
nights ago when it wasn't raining,
it was a clear night and I saw quite a 

1033
00:48:04,511 --> 00:48:06,070
few stars because it was no moon.
I was like,

1034
00:48:06,071 --> 00:48:07,150
wow,
so pretty,

1035
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:09,670
but it ain't shit.
But you're not seeing the volume over.

1036
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:13,270
Yeah.
It's photos that you have added my farm.

1037
00:48:13,271 --> 00:48:16,720
You can just sit there with the naked 
eye and you can look right into those.

1038
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:20,720
There's so many stars and it looks like 
a dark spot of the Milky Way because you

1039
00:48:20,721 --> 00:48:22,050
can see so much of it.
You know,

1040
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:24,910
you see color in it and everything gets 
an amazing spot.

1041
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:26,620
Now the color's weird,
right?

1042
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:28,450
What is the color?
What is that out?

1043
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:31,140
And I was,
I looked at some photos of it.

1044
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:32,100
Oh,
not my own photos.

1045
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:36,110
Someone else's photos and that will show
on the,

1046
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,300
the roar images and the color that was 
coming out of these raw images.

1047
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,480
They look like absolute pill is like 
painted pillars.

1048
00:48:43,481 --> 00:48:44,550
Dude.
You know,

1049
00:48:44,551 --> 00:48:47,230
and it's odd and I don't know if it's a 
debt financier,

1050
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:51,000
if it's something like that.
Jamie put go to Adam.

1051
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:55,090
The first man.
Instagram again like these,

1052
00:48:55,830 --> 00:48:57,880
like the ones of.

1053
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:03,330
Oh look at that one from BC.
Go Down one strip that,

1054
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:05,650
that one there.
That's with the northern lights in it.

1055
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:07,480
Wow.
But yeah,

1056
00:49:07,481 --> 00:49:09,940
that's sad.
No light pollution out there.

1057
00:49:09,941 --> 00:49:12,110
Obviously you saw the northern lights 
and DC.

1058
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:13,013
I didn't know you could see him in BC.
I thought you had to be in like 

1059
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:16,570
icelander assumption.
That was cool.

1060
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:18,213
I've seen him when I was in northwest 
territories are lighting up the ground 

1061
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:22,213
like and right in front of your eyes.
I would just like dance and constantly 

1062
00:49:24,911 --> 00:49:26,620
right in front of your eyes.
That was awesome.

1063
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:30,130
In the Northwest Territories of 
Australia now in Canada.

1064
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:30,790
Oh,
okay.

1065
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:32,920
Yeah.
Northern territories of Australia.

1066
00:49:32,921 --> 00:49:33,754
Right.
That's what they call it.

1067
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:34,900
The last is.
Okay.

1068
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:39,600
So where's it at the best though?
Is that the best place to see it in like

1069
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:42,940
Iceland or some shit or Norway and I 
don't know.

1070
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:45,430
I've seen it.
I've seen it in northwest territory.

1071
00:49:45,431 --> 00:49:45,971
These.
I've seen it.

1072
00:49:45,971 --> 00:49:46,804
The NBC.
I don't think we didn't say it in 

1073
00:49:48,281 --> 00:49:49,990
Alberta when will there?
No,

1074
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:52,350
but I think we had shitty with a wall 
with it.

1075
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,193
Yeah.
It's got to be a crazy thing to see 

1076
00:49:54,341 --> 00:49:54,650
though.
Huh?

1077
00:49:54,650 --> 00:49:56,780
It's like green smoke in the sky.
Yeah.

1078
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:58,690
If you go down a couple more,
Jamie,

1079
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:00,933
please

1080
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:07,510
silent.
That is the,

1081
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,790
that there's the farm.
Go up one.

1082
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:12,190
Yeah.
Hit that one in the middle there.

1083
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:13,840
Wow.
Look at the car and not one.

1084
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:15,940
Ah,
that's amazing.

1085
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:17,373
And is that what kind of.
You have to do something with the 

1086
00:50:19,871 --> 00:50:21,880
aperture?
Well for starters,

1087
00:50:21,881 --> 00:50:25,570
it's open for longer,
so it's cavern in more light,

1088
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:26,710
you know,
like the human eye,

1089
00:50:26,711 --> 00:50:27,544
you to actually lie there in the dark 
for a fire wall and just stare into 

1090
00:50:30,351 --> 00:50:32,630
that.
Sort of get a good look at it.

1091
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:37,430
How long is it open to get that image?
That's like a 13 or 15 seconds.

1092
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:38,450
Oh Wow.
Yup.

1093
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:39,823
You can leave it open for 30 seconds or 
you can put it on like a actual jammed 

1094
00:50:42,791 --> 00:50:46,370
on open for a long time,
but it's way too much light for what the

1095
00:50:46,371 --> 00:50:50,120
farm has and you can start getting a lot
of distortion as well.

1096
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,960
That's such a cool picture with the 
cabin as well.

1097
00:50:53,961 --> 00:50:54,794
With the light coming out of the cabin.
Isn't that crazy that there could be 

1098
00:50:57,830 --> 00:51:00,680
infinite earths out there?
Yeah,

1099
00:51:00,681 --> 00:51:03,380
that's what's crazy.
Is that each one of those is a son.

1100
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:04,243
Yeah.
And most of them are bigger mean 

1101
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:08,900
apparently.
Our son is a little bitch ass son,

1102
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:12,290
son.
Thank God for that.

1103
00:51:12,291 --> 00:51:13,490
I was.
There will be fraud.

1104
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,960
You just have to be further away,
but the big ones don't last that long.

1105
00:51:17,961 --> 00:51:20,600
Apparently Our signs a good one.
It's a,

1106
00:51:20,601 --> 00:51:23,090
it's like a,
it's like a Toyota tercel

1107
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:28,910
shit.
Fucking last is a high luck.

1108
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:30,260
We don't have that over here.
Yeah.

1109
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:31,530
You got like the,
the chemo.

1110
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,040
Yeah.
Lux is like a small Land Cruiser,

1111
00:51:34,041 --> 00:51:34,521
right?
Yeah,

1112
00:51:34,521 --> 00:51:35,354
it is.
Yeah.

1113
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:36,950
Yeah.
I've got a bunch of wacky.

1114
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:39,160
The cruise is probably bet on the bat.
Boy,

1115
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:39,890
Land Cruiser.

1116
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:42,470
That's the high luck today.
The new Land Cruiser.

1117
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,320
The tribe back though.
So like a dual cab.

1118
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,690
So lucked five seats but it's got to try
on it.

1119
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,140
And then the tray,
uh,

1120
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,910
you mean like a pickup truck bed?
Like a pickup truck bed.

1121
00:51:52,911 --> 00:51:54,840
But we usually the,
the,

1122
00:51:55,290 --> 00:51:57,760
the one that's on it off,
we usually grip the truck,

1123
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:59,900
the pickup truck bed off because it's 
like,

1124
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:00,831
it's bulky,
you know,

1125
00:52:00,831 --> 00:52:03,980
there's not a lot of room in it really 
usually rip that off.

1126
00:52:03,981 --> 00:52:07,430
And we'll build a steel tray.
So it's like a whole flatbed.

1127
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:08,853
You might call it a flatbed and uh,
you can just feed a lot more on it and 

1128
00:52:13,521 --> 00:52:14,720
it's a lot more rickety,
you know,

1129
00:52:14,721 --> 00:52:17,330
you can throw rocks on it.
Whatever the fuck you want.

1130
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:18,763
Well you guys have to have vehicles that
you could drive for like a day before 

1131
00:52:24,381 --> 00:52:28,190
you hit a gas station if you do on that 
ap doing those hunts that I do.

1132
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:30,110
Yeah.
So one of the first things you do is you

1133
00:52:30,111 --> 00:52:33,380
rip off the fuel tank and you put like 
an aftermarket fuel tank on it.

1134
00:52:33,381 --> 00:52:34,214
That's usually like twice the capacity.
Well you fro a second fuel tank on it 

1135
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:38,713
and go from there.
So I don't know what are these in 

1136
00:52:40,311 --> 00:52:42,140
gallons,
but like say a fuel tanks,

1137
00:52:42,141 --> 00:52:42,974
like usually 60 liters,
20 gallons is what usually a fuel tanks 

1138
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:46,843
out here.
Well then we'd double up to like 40 or 

1139
00:52:49,251 --> 00:52:53,750
50 or 60 or something like that.
And because it's such a market for it in

1140
00:52:53,751 --> 00:52:54,584
Australia,
there's a bunch of them that you buy 

1141
00:52:55,850 --> 00:52:58,370
ready that already the man onto your 
vehicle.

1142
00:52:58,371 --> 00:52:59,900
Why is there a market for that in 
Australia?

1143
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:01,730
Because it's fucking 100 miles to 
anyway.

1144
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,850
I'm full driving's like different in 
Australia as well,

1145
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:08,793
you know,
it's like.

1146
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:13,220
So where my business is the nearest 
city,

1147
00:53:13,221 --> 00:53:15,680
which is perse,
like 18 hours drive,

1148
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:17,770
you know,
and then we feel teen.

1149
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:21,230
It was drive to the nearest city.
Yup.

1150
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:23,500
Eighteen hours,
18 hours.

1151
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:26,640
What is that Jamie?
That's too far.

1152
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:30,270
But what would it take us to get?
That's like Colorado.

1153
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:32,213
I've driven a car.
I've driven from Ohio to here twice in 

1154
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:39,270
33 hours and 24 hours gets you from 
Columbus to about Amarillo,

1155
00:53:39,271 --> 00:53:42,300
Texas.
And at 24 hours of straight driving,

1156
00:53:42,301 --> 00:53:44,170
straight driving.
Geez.

1157
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:47,730
Western Australia is like a massive 
site.

1158
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:50,590
It goes from the very top of Australia 
to the very bottom of a steroid.

1159
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:55,610
I feel like when you get out of the car 
for 33 hours of driving sucks so bad.

1160
00:53:56,170 --> 00:53:57,630
One time we ended at four in the 
morning,

1161
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:59,670
right on the sunset strip,
right at that hotel.

1162
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:01,470
The Hyatt.
Wow.

1163
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:02,333
Five in the morning.
But when you get in La at four in the 

1164
00:54:03,901 --> 00:54:05,100
morning,
you're right in the traffic again.

1165
00:54:05,101 --> 00:54:06,540
You're like tired as shit.
You're like,

1166
00:54:06,570 --> 00:54:07,470
oh,
it's time to go.

1167
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:09,780
You gotta go because you're about to 
record at the end of the trip,

1168
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,640
but you pump,
you pump in Columbia,

1169
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:14,400
the hallway though,
actually

1170
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:20,370
it's a helies drive and it's just,
you know,

1171
00:54:20,371 --> 00:54:22,110
to some people that's nothing the whole 
way,

1172
00:54:22,111 --> 00:54:22,944
but it's beautiful country.
Like if you're in the outback you 

1173
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:28,020
utilize stare staring out and you happy 
the whole time.

1174
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:32,700
It's not a very popular thing to do in 
Australia to go out into the outback and

1175
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:33,570
it is,
yeah,

1176
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:36,580
between like four drive and like tearing
and theories.

1177
00:54:36,581 --> 00:54:39,030
Ious and like we call them the gray 
nomads,

1178
00:54:39,031 --> 00:54:42,860
so like older people that have retired.
We have gray hair like all nights.

1179
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:45,320
Been great young.
Jamie.

1180
00:54:45,321 --> 00:54:46,320
I ain't looking so young.

1181
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:48,840
But um,
a gray nomad we call them,

1182
00:54:48,841 --> 00:54:53,600
you know,
they'll get like a normal description in

1183
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:56,010
Australia.
Yeah.

1184
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:57,840
We saw these grey nomads out there.
People go,

1185
00:54:57,870 --> 00:54:59,260
okay,
don't say it.

1186
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:00,780
The gray nomads.
So no,

1187
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:01,753
no,
but if you said it went to the gas 

1188
00:55:04,081 --> 00:55:05,180
station,
like you see anybody out that.

1189
00:55:05,181 --> 00:55:06,014
Yeah,
we saw some normal people know what 

1190
00:55:07,621 --> 00:55:08,670
you're saying,
Huh?

1191
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:09,653
Yeah.
Now I'm do most people that would do 

1192
00:55:12,631 --> 00:55:13,490
this,
do they,

1193
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,890
are they just going out there camping?
Just camping,

1194
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:18,240
getting,
getting a good,

1195
00:55:18,310 --> 00:55:20,400
you know,
influx of the outdoor sort of thing,

1196
00:55:20,401 --> 00:55:21,234
you know,
getting a hit.

1197
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:23,370
It seems like there is quite a bit of 
hunting,

1198
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:24,300
you know,
Australia though,

1199
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:27,240
like particularly there is hunting seems
to be on the rise.

1200
00:55:27,350 --> 00:55:28,183
Yeah.
It's just not really promoted will sit 

1201
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,030
for,
you know,

1202
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:33,113
the boating community itself.
Whereas you come to America and those 

1203
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:39,690
towns with big sign up saying welcome 
hunters,

1204
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:41,000
you know,
and it's promoted.

1205
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,233
Yeah.
It's not,

1206
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:43,083
it's like it's not part of our history 
in Australia even though it is signs 

1207
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:48,780
that say,
welcome onto in America,

1208
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:52,140
have you seen in Australia there's none 
of that.

1209
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,273
Yeah,
that's what I meant.

1210
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:56,070
So I think it is on the rise,
you know,

1211
00:55:56,071 --> 00:55:59,430
and I think there's like this bit of a 
trend at the moment,

1212
00:55:59,431 --> 00:56:00,690
you know,
go and kill your own,

1213
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:02,280
which is good.
I love that.

1214
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:05,340
Well socially,
because Australia has so many non native

1215
00:56:05,341 --> 00:56:07,290
species that you can hunt.
Exactly.

1216
00:56:07,291 --> 00:56:10,050
Yeah.
And mean you don't ever have to buy meat

1217
00:56:10,051 --> 00:56:10,890
in Australia.
No,

1218
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,920
do you ever buy meat if we're eating 
chicken?

1219
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:15,390
Yeah,
that's about it,

1220
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:17,140
but just to mix it up.
Yeah.

1221
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:18,053
The fridge is full.
I feel only friends fridge's me 

1222
00:56:19,681 --> 00:56:21,090
families.
Fridges.

1223
00:56:21,091 --> 00:56:22,350
Speaking of chicken,
what's that?

1224
00:56:22,351 --> 00:56:24,340
Mountain Lion Tastes fucking

1225
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:25,173
delicious.
That's what I keep hearing is delicious 

1226
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:28,833
and people get angry.
It's so strange to me how angry people 

1227
00:56:31,751 --> 00:56:32,584
get if you kill them.
Outline because I think they think that 

1228
00:56:35,531 --> 00:56:36,364
if you kill it,
it's different than killing a deer or 

1229
00:56:39,131 --> 00:56:40,780
something.
That's a normal thing to eat.

1230
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:44,530
Even more than a bear.
They get more angry.

1231
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:45,920
So kittycat.
Yeah.

1232
00:56:46,290 --> 00:56:47,680
Yeah.
Meanwhile that motherfucker

1233
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:50,160
killed.
I had a bunch of people sign,

1234
00:56:50,161 --> 00:56:51,460
you know,
you shouldn't have killed a lion.

1235
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:52,800
See Mountain lions,
like I say,

1236
00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:53,683
dear fucking know shit because if you 
seen mountain lions like you've seen 

1237
00:56:56,981 --> 00:56:58,090
deer,
there'd be no dear.

1238
00:56:58,540 --> 00:56:59,960
It's as simple as that.
You know?

1239
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:02,080
I don't know what the numbers are,
but there's probably supposed to be like

1240
00:57:02,081 --> 00:57:05,500
one mountain line for every 500 deer or 
something like that.

1241
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:09,850
That's real hard and there are sneaky 
creature,

1242
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,530
you know,
you're not supposed to see them.

1243
00:57:11,531 --> 00:57:12,770
They're not like that.
Listen,

1244
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,980
you,
you could go your whole life

1245
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:17,130
not seeing them and they can be around 
you all the time.

1246
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:19,760
It's a fact.
If you live in the wilderness,

1247
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:25,240
if you live in Montana or you live in 
Colorado and you live in the woods,

1248
00:57:26,390 --> 00:57:27,223
you might see one every few years.
You might have one every few years and 

1249
00:57:32,271 --> 00:57:33,104
they all fucking everything.

1250
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:35,510
Yeah,
I'll say prince all the time,

1251
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:36,433
but I'll never say a cat like I've 
actually never seen a cat in a wall 

1252
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:39,873
except for the one that I hunted.
And let's like that story I was telling 

1253
00:57:43,641 --> 00:57:45,260
you before,
like it was eating a cough,

1254
00:57:45,261 --> 00:57:48,290
but they typically kill a deer every 
single day.

1255
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:51,230
So it's fucking deer.
This,

1256
00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:54,140
the human brian allows us to manage 
things in a certain way,

1257
00:57:54,141 --> 00:57:54,974
you know,
and it's like these biologists and put 

1258
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:58,650
all of these study and research in the,
you know,

1259
00:57:58,700 --> 00:57:59,301
going,
okay,

1260
00:57:59,301 --> 00:58:02,360
you can hunt males in this area.
So that's all I could hunt where I was.

1261
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:04,670
I could only shoot a mile.
How do you know it's a male?

1262
00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:07,370
Well,
that's when the dogs come in handy.

1263
00:58:07,371 --> 00:58:08,204
So like I've always,
I've never really wanted to hunt with 

1264
00:58:10,521 --> 00:58:12,400
dogs because I'd like to do all the 
hunting myself,

1265
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:13,273
but
there's a special bond between the 

1266
00:58:16,281 --> 00:58:18,230
hunter and the dogs when you're hunting 
those fisher.

1267
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:19,820
And it was actually a really good 
experience.

1268
00:58:19,821 --> 00:58:22,880
I really loved it.
But a lot of people frown on using dogs,

1269
00:58:22,881 --> 00:58:23,714
but the best way to to determine the sex
is the dogs will track it and the line 

1270
00:58:28,701 --> 00:58:29,534
will take refuge in a tree and then you 
can have a look at of genitals and make 

1271
00:58:33,171 --> 00:58:35,530
sure it's a male with binoculars.
Yeah,

1272
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:36,393
yeah.
Or sometimes if they low enough you can 

1273
00:58:37,581 --> 00:58:38,490
tell if the human.
Alright.

1274
00:58:38,491 --> 00:58:40,940
So the first thing we established was,
will.

1275
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:42,073
It was the line that I wanted the lion 
that had killed that calf was eating 

1276
00:58:44,781 --> 00:58:46,400
that calf alive.
We ended up getting the,

1277
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:47,683
getting the rancher to come in and he 
ended up putting the coffee out of its 

1278
00:58:49,341 --> 00:58:50,660
misery.
It couldn't be saved.

1279
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,033
And then we put the dogs back on that 
mountain lion track and Knight chased 

1280
00:58:55,001 --> 00:58:58,490
him about seven miles and I ended up 
training.

1281
00:58:58,491 --> 00:59:00,920
We got,
we marched in and hiked into Detroit and

1282
00:59:00,921 --> 00:59:04,160
ended up determining that it was a mile 
and then um,

1283
00:59:04,161 --> 00:59:06,260
I ended up shooting and it wasn't really
good deaf,

1284
00:59:06,261 --> 00:59:08,090
it was quick,
but um,

1285
00:59:08,870 --> 00:59:10,900
if it was a female would have had to 
have left,

1286
00:59:10,901 --> 00:59:11,601
uh,
where we were.

1287
00:59:11,601 --> 00:59:12,434
Some states aren't like that and 
counties aren't like that where it can 

1288
00:59:14,421 --> 00:59:16,820
be male and female of the population is 
too high.

1289
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:22,190
What they're trying to do in that part 
of Colorado is just keep that mountain

1290
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:23,023
lion population healthy and how they 
determined that was by shooting miles 

1291
00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:28,460
honestly,
that could change next year I could have

1292
00:59:28,461 --> 00:59:29,294
a rise in mountain lion,
a decrease in the mule deer and other 

1293
00:59:32,211 --> 00:59:33,920
animals.
So they might change that again,

1294
00:59:33,921 --> 00:59:36,560
but we could only shoot them mail.
So yeah.

1295
00:59:36,561 --> 00:59:37,394
The problem in America,
particularly in California where they 

1296
00:59:40,611 --> 00:59:45,611
outlawed hunting with dogs,
is that the perception of using a dog to

1297
00:59:45,651 --> 00:59:46,484
go after an animal,
the perception is that it's not fair 

1298
00:59:49,330 --> 00:59:50,690
what people.
I mean,

1299
00:59:50,691 --> 00:59:51,860
this is going to be hard for some 
people,

1300
00:59:51,861 --> 00:59:52,694
especially animal lovers to understand,
but that is the only effective way to 

1301
00:59:57,141 --> 01:00:00,140
hunt for mountain lions because there's 
no way you're going to sneak up on them.

1302
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:02,020
You're just not.
You're not going to see that.

1303
01:00:02,021 --> 01:00:02,854
That's when numbers start to bloom and 
other animals like mule deer and stuff 

1304
01:00:06,111 --> 01:00:07,360
started to plummet.
We talked about it.

1305
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:08,203
A lot that's happening in California is 
the mule deer population has been 

1306
01:00:11,421 --> 01:00:13,900
decimated because there's no control on 
the mountain lions,

1307
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,340
so they do have control of the mountain 
lions,

1308
01:00:16,341 --> 01:00:19,730
but only government employees killed in 
the mountain lion kill.

1309
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:20,833
Ironically,
the same amount of mountain lions they 

1310
01:00:22,611 --> 01:00:24,580
were killing when they were hunting is 
sign.

1311
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:28,340
It's insane,
but instead of people paying money to do

1312
01:00:28,341 --> 01:00:29,174
it and getting it ties back into 
conservation and getting to eat the 

1313
01:00:31,691 --> 01:00:33,440
mount line,
which I know again,

1314
01:00:33,441 --> 01:00:34,850
people like,
what are you talking about?

1315
01:00:34,851 --> 01:00:36,980
Eating mountain line.
I'm telling you folks,

1316
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:40,640
I haven't eaten one,
but I'm telling you and you said it.

1317
01:00:40,641 --> 01:00:43,190
Brunello said it's one of the most 
delicious animals he's ever eaten.

1318
01:00:43,410 --> 01:00:44,690
Yeah.
I wanted to bring us on,

1319
01:00:44,691 --> 01:00:47,690
but it's actually illegal to bring it in
to California.

1320
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:50,150
Good thing.
We always abide by the law,

1321
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:53,780
have green tree and then one day I'll 
try it,

1322
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:56,293
so then I've cooked it up and I'm 
feeding it to Kim and I was cooking 

1323
01:01:00,081 --> 01:01:02,390
chicken as well just in case her and the
kids didn't like it.

1324
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:03,223
I had chicken on the grill as well and I
said the mountain line first and now 

1325
01:01:05,721 --> 01:01:07,700
we're eating the mountain lion and I'm 
like,

1326
01:01:07,701 --> 01:01:09,530
what do you think of it?
And she's like,

1327
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:11,060
I've got the chicken,
and I'm like,

1328
01:01:11,061 --> 01:01:13,040
no you don't.
You've got the mountain line.

1329
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:14,390
And it was delicious.
Dude.

1330
01:01:14,391 --> 01:01:15,224
It's tenderize.
I felt like it was a tie between like 

1331
01:01:19,790 --> 01:01:22,790
chicken and pork or chicken and even 
venison,

1332
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:24,950
like I found it right in the middle 
there.

1333
01:01:24,951 --> 01:01:25,784
It's delicious and I'm not saying 
everyone should go out and hunt and 

1334
01:01:27,171 --> 01:01:28,490
mountain along because you can't do 
that,

1335
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:29,593
but there's certain places that you can 
go and get a tag for the benefit of 

1336
01:01:32,871 --> 01:01:33,704
wildlife and gun hunter mountain line.
People just have a hard time with the 

1337
01:01:36,321 --> 01:01:37,154
idea that you are somehow or another 
helping to control the population by 

1338
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:44,630
killing an animal that kills other 
animals.

1339
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:45,680
Yeah.
Yeah.

1340
01:01:45,681 --> 01:01:46,514
The weird.
They would rather let nature take its 

1341
01:01:48,801 --> 01:01:49,634
course,
but so even if like like let's go to 

1342
01:01:51,951 --> 01:01:56,150
Africa now,
even if the lion population why out wide

1343
01:01:56,151 --> 01:01:58,220
something and was running it to 
extinction,

1344
01:01:58,460 --> 01:01:59,293
these people would want to sit back and 
just let that happen and it's like 

1345
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:07,180
humans have got a brain capacity to 
allows us to study and put research into

1346
01:02:07,191 --> 01:02:10,370
an animal that's like actually what 
would it be more healthier for?

1347
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:14,540
The whole ecosystem would be if we come 
in and hunt these animals and what we'll

1348
01:02:14,541 --> 01:02:15,374
do is we'll charge people a certain tag 
fee to be able to do that and we'll put 

1349
01:02:19,411 --> 01:02:20,244
that back into conservation which will 
help this animal and then there's just 

1350
01:02:22,291 --> 01:02:25,490
this beautiful healthy bowl that keeps 
turning for the people that

1351
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,990
no it.
They respect it and they appreciate it.

1352
01:02:28,350 --> 01:02:29,183
You know,
people like back country hunters and 

1353
01:02:30,241 --> 01:02:32,220
anglers and all these different 
organizations.

1354
01:02:32,221 --> 01:02:34,550
Rocky Mountain Elk Federation,
a lot of different organizations.

1355
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:39,580
They have in United States that really 
appreciate what they're doing to promote

1356
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:40,713
that idea here in America,
but people that don't hunt and don't 

1357
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:48,240
don't go into me.
It took me years to kind of wrap my head

1358
01:02:48,241 --> 01:02:49,074
around it and really truly understand it
and become educated as to how it works 

1359
01:02:52,831 --> 01:02:53,664
and that wildlife biologists set these 
standards and they do it based on 

1360
01:02:55,921 --> 01:02:56,754
healthy populations and how much time 
they spend doing surveys and analyzing 

1361
01:02:59,821 --> 01:03:01,890
the population,
how important it is to,

1362
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:03,193
you know,
these reports and hunter send into 

1363
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:08,550
wildlife organizations and the 
department of fish and game.

1364
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:09,810
It's really interesting stuff

1365
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:10,833
and I'm not a blanket killer even 
because I understand where those people 

1366
01:03:13,391 --> 01:03:16,810
are coming from as well.
We need a certain amount of that because

1367
01:03:16,811 --> 01:03:20,020
it could go the opposite way where it's 
like just go out and hunt everything and

1368
01:03:20,021 --> 01:03:20,854
it's not the case.
If something's not in a good healthy 

1369
01:03:22,571 --> 01:03:23,404
population.
I'm not interested in hunted over all 

1370
01:03:24,621 --> 01:03:25,600
myself.
Of course.

1371
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:28,150
I want to say these animals stay here 
for forever.

1372
01:03:28,151 --> 01:03:29,110
I want my kids,
kids,

1373
01:03:29,111 --> 01:03:29,944
kids,
kids to be able to see those animals in 

1374
01:03:31,661 --> 01:03:33,310
good health.
Healthy population.

1375
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:33,911
Yeah.
Look,

1376
01:03:33,911 --> 01:03:34,370
when I hear you

1377
01:03:34,370 --> 01:03:35,203
about limited entry tags for like,
like for Moose or something like that 

1378
01:03:38,691 --> 01:03:42,470
because there's a small number and 
they'll let a certain amount of people.

1379
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,980
What?
Fuck you do.

1380
01:03:44,981 --> 01:03:49,830
Adam green trees,
ages that Kombucha is a tale.

1381
01:03:49,850 --> 01:03:52,530
He has.
This happened now I'm a slob.

1382
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:54,730
That's why the towels here.
I fucking spill everything.

1383
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:56,520
I've.
I've ruined two laptop at least.

1384
01:03:56,640 --> 01:04:00,730
At least two laptops during the show.
She gets angry.

1385
01:04:00,731 --> 01:04:02,560
That's like it's angry.
Americans.

1386
01:04:02,561 --> 01:04:04,750
Dangerous.
It is fucking Kombucha.

1387
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:07,600
GTS conclusions.
Going back to the coffee

1388
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:09,633
I found out like,
like in some places they have a small 

1389
01:04:11,291 --> 01:04:12,124
amount of Moose and they'll let you hunt
a moose but it has to be like one moose 

1390
01:04:17,711 --> 01:04:20,740
and it has to be over 50 inches and like
I'm out.

1391
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:23,460
I don't want to shoot that Moose.
How many of them are there?

1392
01:04:23,490 --> 01:04:25,060
There's 200 of them.
Fuck out of here.

1393
01:04:25,061 --> 01:04:27,130
I'm not shooting.
You know what if,

1394
01:04:27,131 --> 01:04:29,250
what if the winter comes and kills a 
bunch of them off?

1395
01:04:29,251 --> 01:04:32,860
Like which happens would have wolves 
move in happens.

1396
01:04:32,861 --> 01:04:33,500
Yeah.
Yeah.

1397
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:37,430
And that's why these tag limits in that 
change from year to year as well.

1398
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:41,450
Like I've seen them constantly change 
because that will do the research or the

1399
01:04:41,451 --> 01:04:44,650
kill wasn't big enough last year or the 
winner was too harsh and you know,

1400
01:04:44,690 --> 01:04:46,250
they start limiting and tags.
Yeah.

1401
01:04:46,251 --> 01:04:48,830
That's very sad.
I think in most cases,

1402
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:51,680
in most cases we've got it right.
Yeah,

1403
01:04:51,681 --> 01:04:52,514
I think so too.
What's one of the reasons why one of my 

1404
01:04:54,441 --> 01:04:55,274
favorite places to hunt as alumni 
because Linda did so out of whack with 

1405
01:05:00,010 --> 01:05:04,240
fucking spotted little demons that just 
jump out of the white arrows constantly.

1406
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:08,390
It's crazy of an animal that evolved to 
get away from tigers.

1407
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:12,700
You can't believe how fast those Goddamn
and delicious.

1408
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:13,850
Yeah.
He was saying it's a,

1409
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:14,973
it's,
it's kind of a weird coincidence that 

1410
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:19,390
the fastest you can hunt,
it's also the most delicious.

1411
01:05:19,391 --> 01:05:20,410
Yeah.
Oh totally.

1412
01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:22,010
Yeah.
Yeah.

1413
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:25,960
That's kind of weird because they are 
delicious.

1414
01:05:25,961 --> 01:05:28,150
They learned to move faster.
I think a d,

1415
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:29,313
so you know,
we say jumped the string like when you 

1416
01:05:30,461 --> 01:05:31,294
shoot like the dia,
he is the Bogo off or something like 

1417
01:05:33,041 --> 01:05:35,560
that and we call it jumped the string,
which you'll know about this,

1418
01:05:35,561 --> 01:05:36,394
but a lot of people want.
They don't actually don't jump out of 

1419
01:05:38,261 --> 01:05:39,340
the string.
When I miss you,

1420
01:05:39,341 --> 01:05:42,250
I heard that actually dropped to bound 
the why.

1421
01:05:42,251 --> 01:05:45,450
So they drop load up their legs and then
jen jump.

1422
01:05:45,730 --> 01:05:48,250
But it's actually the drop.
That's when you usually miss him.

1423
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:52,000
Will that moves that over 1300 feet per 
second.

1424
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:56,500
A really good bowl shoots at about 300 
feet per second in a hunting situation.

1425
01:05:56,830 --> 01:06:01,090
So you can't beat them 13,
1300 feet per second.

1426
01:06:01,091 --> 01:06:04,270
That's how fast they stopped dropping.
That's insane.

1427
01:06:04,690 --> 01:06:05,523
Well the thing about access deer as 
opposed to any other animal I've ever 

1428
01:06:07,691 --> 01:06:09,640
hunted is they don't just jump the 
string.

1429
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:11,050
They get out of the way.
Yeah.

1430
01:06:11,290 --> 01:06:13,520
The whole body length,
like yeah,

1431
01:06:14,110 --> 01:06:17,200
like you have to date,
they have to not know you're there.

1432
01:06:17,930 --> 01:06:22,930
Like the first one that I killed this 
season had no idea was there no idea.

1433
01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:24,670
No idea was there and there's a nice 
wind,

1434
01:06:24,850 --> 01:06:27,100
so when that Arrow hit him,
he was quarter in a way.

1435
01:06:27,101 --> 01:06:27,934
When that hit him,
he had no idea it was common to perfect 

1436
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:31,930
it.
Was that a trip or a different one?

1437
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:32,590
Yeah,
that was.

1438
01:06:32,590 --> 01:06:35,500
That was when I got out of the car and I
saw 1:15 minutes.

1439
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:40,340
You have big velvet,
so I try and it's assigned.

1440
01:06:40,370 --> 01:06:43,750
We fell idea back in Australia.
Like they've really fast off the mark.

1441
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:44,973
I'll try and shoot them when they busy,
you know when they've got other noise 

1442
01:06:47,111 --> 01:06:47,944
happening,
they write in their aunt Lou's stepping 

1443
01:06:49,361 --> 01:06:50,620
forward or something like that.

1444
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:55,610
And the few that I shot in Lanai,
one was scuffling with another Bach,

1445
01:06:55,870 --> 01:06:58,780
so he was old busy and he didn't move at
all and it pegged him.

1446
01:06:59,190 --> 01:07:00,023
The avalon was he in high wind in the 
grass and it had the grass like moving 

1447
01:07:02,711 --> 01:07:03,544
around it and he didn't move and then 
the third one was on a really still die 

1448
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:08,733
and I actually I am for his heart and he
dropped an I end up hitting you in 

1449
01:07:10,911 --> 01:07:13,780
double lungs.
It's just they're so quick.

1450
01:07:13,781 --> 01:07:14,614
It's like you need to calculate even 
right at the moment when you're looking 

1451
01:07:17,551 --> 01:07:18,384
gun to shoot,
it was like you need the white for 

1452
01:07:19,601 --> 01:07:22,040
something extra to happen,
you know?

1453
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:22,953
Yeah.
Well it's a great place to get accustom 

1454
01:07:26,950 --> 01:07:31,950
to stalking and hunting animals with a 
bow tie because the opportunities are so

1455
01:07:32,711 --> 01:07:33,200
many.
Yeah.

1456
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,260
You blow on your like I'll move onto the
next one.

1457
01:07:35,290 --> 01:07:40,290
There's 20,000 deer and 3000 people.
It's tiny little island.

1458
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:41,740
Yeah.
Did you,

1459
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:45,000
did you ever go out at night in a car 
when you see the other side of the road?

1460
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:45,873
I think,
I think I was in the car with you and 

1461
01:07:47,441 --> 01:07:51,670
there was like $400 common across the 
road and it's just like all these little

1462
01:07:51,671 --> 01:07:54,450
lies just going
nonstop.

1463
01:07:54,710 --> 01:07:55,543
Didn't even make sense and they hire 
people to go in there with sniper 

1464
01:07:57,551 --> 01:07:59,590
rifles,
so just take them out one after another.

1465
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:00,513
It's crazy.
And then something that's always got to 

1466
01:08:03,431 --> 01:08:04,264
me.
So like one of the property owners that 

1467
01:08:06,011 --> 01:08:10,420
lives beside my property where a hunt,
he'll go out and [inaudible] dear vermin

1468
01:08:10,421 --> 01:08:13,240
in Australia and they've just been 
declassified.

1469
01:08:13,241 --> 01:08:16,160
They classified and those game animals 
for a year or a couple

1470
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,410
of years now,
they've just declassify them because the

1471
01:08:18,411 --> 01:08:21,830
numbers are just exploding.
So you can shoot them under the lights.

1472
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:23,540
You can,
you can do anything.

1473
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:24,950
You can feed them,
you can buy them,

1474
01:08:24,951 --> 01:08:27,720
you can do whatever you want.
You want to get rid of them.

1475
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:29,960
And uh,
so this guy,

1476
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:33,020
he raises cattle and uh,
so that's what he has.

1477
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:34,093
He'll go out at night and he'll shoot 
these deer and just leave them right 

1478
01:08:35,961 --> 01:08:38,600
where they lay,
not take any meat off more than anything

1479
01:08:38,630 --> 01:08:42,110
but then kill one of his own cattle to 
fill these freezer and fridge.

1480
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:46,120
And the first time he'd actually eight 
and venison was when I shot.

1481
01:08:46,270 --> 01:08:50,210
I shot a deer on his property and I cut 
it up and I actually gave it to him.

1482
01:08:50,270 --> 01:08:52,820
That was the first time you'd ever eaten
venison deer.

1483
01:08:52,821 --> 01:08:54,920
And unlike John,
you had like killing your own cattle,

1484
01:08:54,921 --> 01:08:59,150
these delicious meat sitting right there
as this walled resource.

1485
01:08:59,151 --> 01:09:01,310
And it's renewable because they fuck 
each other.

1486
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:01,910
They buried.

1487
01:09:01,910 --> 01:09:02,743
Yeah.
And so he's eating his own cattle and 

1488
01:09:04,530 --> 01:09:05,110
selling them.

1489
01:09:05,110 --> 01:09:06,970
Yeah.
And now the thing is this,

1490
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:11,560
another way that I've always looked at 
it is these walled animals have there,

1491
01:09:11,950 --> 01:09:13,790
whether you like it or not,
they're there.

1492
01:09:14,010 --> 01:09:14,843
Why place another cow or another sheep 
in the paddock to put strain on the 

1493
01:09:17,921 --> 01:09:20,830
landscape if you,
especially if you ate and your own.

1494
01:09:21,310 --> 01:09:22,143
Why not just go and shoot a d?
It's a wild animal and you're doing the 

1495
01:09:24,311 --> 01:09:26,260
ecosystem of service by doing it.

1496
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:29,120
And there is some of the most healthy 
animals.

1497
01:09:29,121 --> 01:09:30,770
Delicious.
Delicious.

1498
01:09:30,771 --> 01:09:31,604
They're super healthy for you.
They're so rich in vitamins and 

1499
01:09:34,041 --> 01:09:38,690
nutrients and protein and the tea.
I prefer it over everything.

1500
01:09:38,710 --> 01:09:39,770
Yeah.
I really do.

1501
01:09:39,860 --> 01:09:41,360
Yeah,
and it's not just the taste,

1502
01:09:41,361 --> 01:09:42,950
it's that whole feeling thing.
Like,

1503
01:09:42,951 --> 01:09:44,770
I went and got this,
I earned this,

1504
01:09:44,790 --> 01:09:46,730
I killed this.
I know where this comes from.

1505
01:09:46,731 --> 01:09:49,310
You're attached to.
It was spoken about it before,

1506
01:09:49,311 --> 01:09:54,311
but when you get mate that served in a 
package at the supermarket that goes for

1507
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:58,880
pass hundreds and hundreds of people's 
hands and breaths and stuff like that,

1508
01:09:58,881 --> 01:09:59,450
you know,

1509
01:09:59,450 --> 01:10:00,283
it's just like having sex with scarlet 
Johanson and the virtual reality to a 

1510
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:07,070
guy that's the next detachment.
The fucking.

1511
01:10:07,071 --> 01:10:09,300
It's going to be made instead of made.
It's going to be sick.

1512
01:10:09,310 --> 01:10:10,960
Says the next detachment.
Well there's a,

1513
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:11,873
there's these people that are making 
artificial meat now are not just 

1514
01:10:14,571 --> 01:10:15,920
artificial,
I shouldn't say artificial.

1515
01:10:15,921 --> 01:10:16,754
It's real meat,
but it's meat that's made in a lab and 

1516
01:10:19,250 --> 01:10:20,083
that's the,
I don't know what they're calling an 

1517
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:23,330
ethical meat or whatever the fuck 
they're calling it,

1518
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:27,350
but it's the future of,
of meat production and you know,

1519
01:10:27,351 --> 01:10:28,184
this is making animal rights people very
excited because they're basically gonna 

1520
01:10:30,270 --> 01:10:32,580
have just lapped me.

1521
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:33,770
That's so fucking.
Yeah.

1522
01:10:33,771 --> 01:10:34,970
So you know,
it's gonna happen.

1523
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:36,013
No more cows,
no more domestic pig's name on the shit 

1524
01:10:38,121 --> 01:10:38,954
that they love.
Like the reason that cows there is 

1525
01:10:40,731 --> 01:10:41,564
because there's a demand for meat.
So that cow gets a life because there's 

1526
01:10:45,141 --> 01:10:45,974
mate.
Right?

1527
01:10:46,130 --> 01:10:46,963
No one's going to let these cows and 
sheep and domestic pigs and sheep 

1528
01:10:48,861 --> 01:10:49,694
running around on their landscape and 
take out real estate if there's no 

1529
01:10:51,770 --> 01:10:52,603
market for.

1530
01:10:52,670 --> 01:10:57,260
Pigs are the weirdest one because pigs,
like my friend Whitney Cummings,

1531
01:10:57,290 --> 01:11:01,070
she adopted a pig that.
Where'd she get that pig?

1532
01:11:01,430 --> 01:11:02,780
I think it was from the fire,
right?

1533
01:11:02,870 --> 01:11:03,703
Yeah,
and she actually wound up driving it to 

1534
01:11:05,391 --> 01:11:08,240
Texas.
She drove in her car 24 hours.

1535
01:11:08,241 --> 01:11:11,060
She's a fucking maniac when it comes to 
animals.

1536
01:11:11,061 --> 01:11:11,894
I think her and her fiance drove Texas 
with this fucking pig to drop it off at 

1537
01:11:16,111 --> 01:11:20,010
this pig shelter and damn dude,
when she's with that pig,

1538
01:11:20,011 --> 01:11:24,000
that thing is like a dog.
Might as well be.

1539
01:11:24,001 --> 01:11:27,910
My dog is like hanging out there animal 
yet,

1540
01:11:28,110 --> 01:11:32,790
but when they get loose and they're out 
in the wild boy,

1541
01:11:32,791 --> 01:11:35,310
they fucking breed three,
four times a year.

1542
01:11:35,370 --> 01:11:39,210
They'll have big piles of piglets and 
piglets will destroy.

1543
01:11:39,211 --> 01:11:41,360
They eat everything in sight there.
Omnivorous,

1544
01:11:41,590 --> 01:11:46,590
devastating thing for everything to 
devastating to plants and ground nesting

1545
01:11:46,681 --> 01:11:47,790
birds,
animals,

1546
01:11:47,791 --> 01:11:49,770
everything.
They eat everything in front of them.

1547
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:50,770
They're pigs.

1548
01:11:50,770 --> 01:11:52,350
Yeah,
and I hate them.

1549
01:11:52,810 --> 01:11:55,620
I got a height on love pigs.
I think they're an unread animal,

1550
01:11:55,621 --> 01:11:58,240
but the bigger picture is I need to be 
controlled.

1551
01:11:58,241 --> 01:12:02,140
They can't go out there and just ruined 
the ecosystem like that.

1552
01:12:02,170 --> 01:12:02,680
Well,
there's.

1553
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:03,513
You're seeing in Texas,
Texas is probably in the United States 

1554
01:12:06,161 --> 01:12:09,970
is the biggest example of what happens 
when or the best example.

1555
01:12:09,971 --> 01:12:13,510
What happens in these feral hogs are 
just completely out of control.

1556
01:12:13,870 --> 01:12:17,590
They just devastate these agricultural 
farms.

1557
01:12:17,870 --> 01:12:20,140
They have these farms and they're just 
getting destroyed.

1558
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:21,980
God

1559
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:22,813
life.
Other wildlife as well because I hate 

1560
01:12:24,031 --> 01:12:24,864
frogs and now lean lizards now.
Anything that on the ground that's 

1561
01:12:27,571 --> 01:12:29,080
edible about Ada.
Yeah.

1562
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:31,830
I wrote an article years ago.
It was cold

1563
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:34,583
killer at the pos.
It was a place in Australia and the the 

1564
01:12:38,190 --> 01:12:40,890
property owners like the ranch has 
called me out and I said,

1565
01:12:40,891 --> 01:12:42,700
you need to come out and shoot some of 
the boxes.

1566
01:12:42,710 --> 01:12:43,543
Like they'd devastating our lambs and I 
ended up going out there and when I was 

1567
01:12:48,091 --> 01:12:50,790
driving in with a forward drive at night
with the high beams on,

1568
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:52,013
I seen this massive big black and white 
bull walking between the flock of sheep 

1569
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:55,973
with a laminate to mouth.
It was these pig and it had got a taste 

1570
01:12:58,111 --> 01:13:01,420
for meat and it happens all the time.
Like so a big bull,

1571
01:13:01,430 --> 01:13:05,220
especially in mature animal will get a 
taste for meat in harsher conditions.

1572
01:13:05,260 --> 01:13:06,093
Now just stick the meat off to that.
And I ended up catching up with these 

1573
01:13:09,181 --> 01:13:11,180
pig the next morning and shot it with 
the bow.

1574
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:12,373
It actually attacked me.
The first shot wasn't perfect and it 

1575
01:13:14,311 --> 01:13:16,560
charged me and I ended up stabbing it to
death.

1576
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:18,433
I was on a slope like this on the 
mountain cheese and it was really a 

1577
01:13:21,271 --> 01:13:22,104
battle like any high end up hooking the 
ball out of my hand because when he 

1578
01:13:25,321 --> 01:13:26,154
charged me I'll put an Erewhon and shot 
and just went down one side and hit one 

1579
01:13:29,101 --> 01:13:29,934
lung.
And it just infuriated this bowl and he 

1580
01:13:32,191 --> 01:13:33,590
was on me.
And um,

1581
01:13:33,930 --> 01:13:35,420
when I was fending them off with the 
bow,

1582
01:13:35,421 --> 01:13:36,720
he's tasked,
went into the bottom,

1583
01:13:36,790 --> 01:13:37,623
limit the bow or the cam or something 
like that and rip the bone out of my 

1584
01:13:40,021 --> 01:13:40,854
hand.
And I ended up getting me knife off me 

1585
01:13:43,081 --> 01:13:45,630
and I ended up stabbing this pig was 
electronic,

1586
01:13:45,631 --> 01:13:47,400
run me over.
Oh Shit.

1587
01:13:47,401 --> 01:13:50,460
How big was it?
It was a big boys big meeting.

1588
01:13:50,610 --> 01:13:53,760
It made eight and bullet like this.
And like how many pounds?

1589
01:13:54,190 --> 01:13:56,430
A fucking big 10.
Many pounds.

1590
01:13:56,431 --> 01:13:57,264
300.
Probably not 300 and mountain bullets 

1591
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:01,050
just get real solid.
Yeah,

1592
01:14:01,051 --> 01:14:02,640
probably $200.
Something like that.

1593
01:14:03,270 --> 01:14:04,103
And anyway,
I ended up stabbing this thing to death 

1594
01:14:06,990 --> 01:14:10,700
and when I ended up cutting it open its 
whole insides,

1595
01:14:10,710 --> 01:14:12,130
like it's whole stomach was like

1596
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:13,600
lambs hawks,
like the feet,

1597
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:14,673
the bottom of the feet where they can't 
swallow and skulls and just like little 

1598
01:14:17,681 --> 01:14:18,514
bits of wool and stuff like that.
He'd just been going around and just 

1599
01:14:22,150 --> 01:14:22,983
picking these lambs often killing them.
And it's a really known occurrence in 

1600
01:14:26,621 --> 01:14:28,470
Australia.
And how that if things get harsh,

1601
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,000
I would just go.
That would just because they,

1602
01:14:30,070 --> 01:14:30,903
they just absolutely ruthless.
I would just walk right between the 

1603
01:14:32,591 --> 01:14:36,830
shape and just fucking grab a lamb 
wolkoff chew it up and by.

1604
01:14:37,150 --> 01:14:39,670
Anyway,
first thing in that morning that I found

1605
01:14:39,671 --> 01:14:40,504
was a pig spew and it was like this 
fucking spew like this and it was the 

1606
01:14:43,601 --> 01:14:48,601
same as lambs hawks and speak to vomit 
United States view in America.

1607
01:14:48,911 --> 01:14:49,810
You do,
but I wasn't.

1608
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:51,490
I thought it meant something else to 
you.

1609
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:53,150
Yeah,
fucking spewing my.

1610
01:14:53,220 --> 01:14:54,053
Yeah.
Spewed spewed out what happened at 

1611
01:14:57,581 --> 01:14:58,414
Disney yesterday.

1612
01:14:59,030 --> 01:14:59,863
Butyl on me.
So they just threw up bones just for 

1613
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:07,270
bones and stuff that it couldn't digest,
but end up,

1614
01:15:07,390 --> 01:15:08,223
yeah,
lamb killer at the destructive animal 

1615
01:15:09,731 --> 01:15:13,710
and they're so ruthlessly efficient in 
terms of like how much food they can.

1616
01:15:13,790 --> 01:15:16,770
So a deal walk along and it will pick,
you know,

1617
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:20,200
it would just pick the top soft grass 
and the grass regrows,

1618
01:15:20,201 --> 01:15:22,390
you know,
a pig will go through and eat that grass

1619
01:15:22,391 --> 01:15:24,860
and it'll turn it over and eat the roots
and everything as well.

1620
01:15:25,330 --> 01:15:26,163
Causes a lot of erosion and then there's
no great growth because it was my roots 

1621
01:15:28,811 --> 01:15:31,090
in because they're greedy pigs.
They greedy pigs.

1622
01:15:31,091 --> 01:15:33,890
There you go.
But you don't.

1623
01:15:33,891 --> 01:15:36,220
They're the number one cause of death on
farms.

1624
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:37,510
Grilling.
Yeah.

1625
01:15:37,511 --> 01:15:38,344
Apparently with domestic animals,
people fallen into pig pens and just 

1626
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:43,053
into them they just devour and you know,
when you're dealing with these giant 

1627
01:15:47,591 --> 01:15:49,660
domestic pigs,
they get fucking,

1628
01:15:49,690 --> 01:15:50,523
he,
you massive hundreds of pounds in like 

1629
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:55,690
Western New South Wales when times get 
tough,

1630
01:15:55,691 --> 01:15:58,330
which is,
seems to be fucking all the time now.

1631
01:15:58,900 --> 01:15:59,733
But um,
they'll get so desperate you'll shoot a 

1632
01:16:01,751 --> 01:16:04,030
pig on for it for the farmer and you 
just shoot it to me.

1633
01:16:04,031 --> 01:16:06,780
Not even really taken any made often 
because they like,

1634
01:16:07,290 --> 01:16:11,710
they can meet their self and they like 
skin and bones and disgusting.

1635
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:13,113
It's more of like a commission and 
you'll come back in the afternoon and 

1636
01:16:16,150 --> 01:16:16,983
that pig will be completely skin and 
bones [inaudible] the other pigs just 

1637
01:16:20,021 --> 01:16:21,790
get in there and just.
And you'll hear them,

1638
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:26,020
you'll just hear him just screaming.
It's the most God awful sound there is.

1639
01:16:26,550 --> 01:16:28,360
Cannibalize that cannibalize.
Yeah.

1640
01:16:28,690 --> 01:16:33,140
I was in to hone ranch and we were 
walking by this really high grass grass,

1641
01:16:33,170 --> 01:16:34,003
like five foot high and you.
We were only like maybe 10 yards away 

1642
01:16:37,421 --> 01:16:40,600
from these pigs fighting and I said to.
I said,

1643
01:16:40,601 --> 01:16:41,434
no,
come on man.

1644
01:16:41,860 --> 01:16:42,693
If you didn't know those were pigs,
if I told you there was demons in that 

1645
01:16:45,170 --> 01:16:47,510
grass,
you completely believe it.

1646
01:16:50,660 --> 01:16:52,760
Something.
Yeah.

1647
01:16:54,890 --> 01:16:56,770
Yeah.
That was great.

1648
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:00,940
But it sounded like Lord of the rings.
So like some horrific scene.

1649
01:17:01,690 --> 01:17:03,070
Monster movie.
Yeah.

1650
01:17:03,071 --> 01:17:06,940
It sounded like it really did.
I mean it's just.

1651
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,980
How is that the same animal as those 
cute little things that

1652
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:14,570
Whitney Cummings is totally [inaudible] 
the one that she had was like all fluffy

1653
01:17:14,571 --> 01:17:19,571
and sit in her bed that she taught her 
how to go outside and go take the pig is

1654
01:17:19,780 --> 01:17:21,740
a pig.
That was the other thing she told me.

1655
01:17:22,130 --> 01:17:24,950
Apparently those little pigs are not 
real.

1656
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:27,200
All they are is just underfed.
Yeah,

1657
01:17:27,201 --> 01:17:28,460
right.
That's pretty fucking.

1658
01:17:28,490 --> 01:17:30,860
That's fucked up.
Like when those people have those little

1659
01:17:30,861 --> 01:17:31,694
tiny pig,
she's like,

1660
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:33,530
that's not real.
They're just,

1661
01:17:33,650 --> 01:17:35,390
Oh,
it's a baby pig.

1662
01:17:35,391 --> 01:17:37,730
It's a tiny little pig.
It's just going to stay tiny.

1663
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:41,360
No,
if you don't feed it stayed tiny.

1664
01:17:42,050 --> 01:17:45,490
That's about when a memory.
When they had the kittens in the jaws,

1665
01:17:45,550 --> 01:17:47,920
I think it was a nice thing or 
something.

1666
01:17:48,220 --> 01:17:49,750
He'd never seen that.
No.

1667
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:50,673
They had the day were like a little 
glass jar and they'd have a cat in the 

1668
01:17:54,011 --> 01:17:56,410
glass jar I think.
I think they're always fight,

1669
01:17:56,411 --> 01:17:59,200
but people advertisement like this is 
how you can have your cat.

1670
01:18:00,820 --> 01:18:02,080
Holy Fuck.
It looked that up.

1671
01:18:02,270 --> 01:18:05,500
Recognition and it's real.
There you go.

1672
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:06,900
Kitty cat.
No,

1673
01:18:06,910 --> 01:18:07,743
they afraid

1674
01:18:08,210 --> 01:18:11,810
that's fake.
Oh fuck.

1675
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:14,240
Look at that thing.
Xyz.

1676
01:18:15,050 --> 01:18:16,490
Okay.
Some of those look real.

1677
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:19,830
So is it just for fun?
There's okay.

1678
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:21,173
They're just before now,
before there was some real ones where 

1679
01:18:23,311 --> 01:18:25,530
they had the lead on them and 
everything.

1680
01:18:25,590 --> 01:18:26,423
Well,
you can guarantee somebody got those 

1681
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:28,790
fuckers that have got there

1682
01:18:29,090 --> 01:18:29,990
blurt out.
Oh,

1683
01:18:30,020 --> 01:18:30,853
Jesus Christ,
to apologize for stuffing kitten in a 

1684
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:35,900
jar.
Sorry.

1685
01:18:38,030 --> 01:18:40,260
Yeah.
Well fuck man.

1686
01:18:41,210 --> 01:18:42,260
Yeah,
yeah.

1687
01:18:42,261 --> 01:18:44,420
People are capable of incredible 
cruelty.

1688
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:45,733
Yeah.
Animals.

1689
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:47,390
That's why we need the upper end of 
things.

1690
01:18:47,420 --> 01:18:49,550
That's why I say I can understand it.
You know,

1691
01:18:49,570 --> 01:18:50,403
you need that other,
like I'm an extreme where I'm just like 

1692
01:18:53,090 --> 01:18:53,923
on everything,
but I'm sure there's a few people out 

1693
01:18:55,371 --> 01:18:58,040
there like that.
I've never met them where they just kill

1694
01:18:58,041 --> 01:18:58,874
everything.
Then you need the other extreme where 

1695
01:19:00,231 --> 01:19:00,861
it's like,
no,

1696
01:19:00,861 --> 01:19:03,350
all animals are sacred.
Don't touch any animals.

1697
01:19:03,351 --> 01:19:04,280
You know,
they can't be killed.

1698
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:06,590
You know,
and then try and find that middle ground

1699
01:19:06,591 --> 01:19:08,160
where you're like,
well that's fucking ridiculous.

1700
01:19:08,161 --> 01:19:10,700
And that's ridiculous.
This is where I am.

1701
01:19:10,910 --> 01:19:12,980
I couldn't agree more.
I think that's a perfect way to put it.

1702
01:19:12,981 --> 01:19:14,330
Yeah.
Yeah.

1703
01:19:14,331 --> 01:19:15,230
I think,
um,

1704
01:19:15,650 --> 01:19:17,660
I think a lot of those animal rights 
people,

1705
01:19:18,050 --> 01:19:20,900
they,
it comes from a good place.

1706
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:22,580
Yeah.
That's how I feel too.

1707
01:19:22,820 --> 01:19:24,740
They care about animals that comes from 
a good place,

1708
01:19:24,741 --> 01:19:29,450
but their understanding of population 
control and wildlife management and just

1709
01:19:29,451 --> 01:19:31,670
the reality of human beings,
it just,

1710
01:19:31,710 --> 01:19:33,410
they just don't think they're getting 
it.

1711
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:34,533
With the mountain lion thing,
one of the things they found with 

1712
01:19:36,351 --> 01:19:37,184
mountain lions in California is that 
almost 50 percent of their diet is 

1713
01:19:39,531 --> 01:19:43,070
domestic pets.
There's go to nature is metal.

1714
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:46,280
Go to nature as metal.com.
My all time favorite instagram page,

1715
01:19:46,310 --> 01:19:48,350
so the mountain lion that gets paid 
back.

1716
01:19:48,710 --> 01:19:52,970
Either he got his page back or they.
He had to open up another one,

1717
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:54,430
but that guy has the most fun

1718
01:19:54,740 --> 01:19:59,250
instagram sensitive sensitizing some 
sheet at the moment they came,

1719
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:02,540
came ahead of video,
Tony like a 15,

1720
01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:06,050
22nd video of her.
It was carrying a white tail deer out in

1721
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:08,070
Texas.
There was no blood on it enough and

1722
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:08,903
you couldn't see that it had been 
gathered or anything like that and they 

1723
01:20:11,281 --> 01:20:13,290
removed it.
Said it was violence.

1724
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:14,333
Okay.
This is nature is metal underscore 

1725
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:18,780
backup account.
I don't follow it though,

1726
01:20:18,781 --> 01:20:21,000
but yeah,
the other accounts not up anymore.

1727
01:20:21,590 --> 01:20:24,570
We'll click on the most recent one.
That lion image.

1728
01:20:25,530 --> 01:20:28,140
When is that from?
December 20.

1729
01:20:28,170 --> 01:20:29,003
No,
it's new.

1730
01:20:29,310 --> 01:20:31,600
It's new.
See if they're back behind back.

1731
01:20:31,890 --> 01:20:34,410
Yeah.
Don't go to nature is metal underscore.

1732
01:20:34,411 --> 01:20:38,450
Just go to nature is metal.
All metal.

1733
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:41,880
I fought it.
Segmental metal to metal.

1734
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:45,180
Um,
so that's it.

1735
01:20:45,181 --> 01:20:47,070
That's the real one.
So scroll up,

1736
01:20:47,490 --> 01:20:49,980
keep going.
And that's it right there with the car.

1737
01:20:50,370 --> 01:20:51,203
This is the quick and the dead.
This is a Florida panther in this guy's 

1738
01:20:54,571 --> 01:20:56,940
driveway.
Snatches up a house pet.

1739
01:20:56,970 --> 01:20:57,803
Wash.
This shit.

1740
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:01,380
This is what the fuck you have.
This is what the fuck happens.

1741
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:03,780
So This guy's got his security camera 
running.

1742
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:05,910
Damn.
That's a wrap.

1743
01:21:06,330 --> 01:21:11,010
To wrap a little fella that a dog or a 
cat fucking nearly looks like a cat.

1744
01:21:11,310 --> 01:21:13,620
It's a kitty cat.
Killed the cat.

1745
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:16,330
Everyone likes to be to put.
See there's a.

1746
01:21:16,410 --> 01:21:18,060
How dare you?
There's a,

1747
01:21:18,690 --> 01:21:20,340
there's a growing population.
These things,

1748
01:21:20,341 --> 01:21:23,210
they're endangered but they're there.
And uh,

1749
01:21:23,260 --> 01:21:24,510
you know,
basically,

1750
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:25,673
I mean it's a subspecies I guess,
but it's basically the same thing as a 

1751
01:21:27,841 --> 01:21:30,840
mountain lion.
Look at them.

1752
01:21:31,650 --> 01:21:34,380
The first time I did a little bit of 
research in google,

1753
01:21:34,381 --> 01:21:35,214
it just comes up that cougars are 
endangered in America and but when you 

1754
01:21:41,071 --> 01:21:41,904
start looking into it then not all there
on the least concern list in America 

1755
01:21:44,521 --> 01:21:45,354
because the populations for driving and 
then when I spoke to a dnr in Colorado 

1756
01:21:50,311 --> 01:21:51,120
about,
you know,

1757
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:51,953
the cougar as well that was signed,
that they have populations continued to 

1758
01:21:55,111 --> 01:21:57,960
rise even with the tags that they've 
given out.

1759
01:21:57,960 --> 01:21:58,793
The po population just continues to rise
and without dogs you're just not going 

1760
01:22:03,101 --> 01:22:08,030
to hunt them in the way that you might 
get lucky and stumble across one.

1761
01:22:08,031 --> 01:22:08,864
It's not paying attention to you.
You'd want to have limitless time 

1762
01:22:12,181 --> 01:22:12,970
though,
you know,

1763
01:22:12,970 --> 01:22:15,420
like to actually that's the difference.
You know,

1764
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:17,970
I'd like to have limitless time and then
just be like,

1765
01:22:17,971 --> 01:22:18,804
okay,
I'm dedicating a whole month to stalk 

1766
01:22:20,251 --> 01:22:21,400
and cougars,
you know,

1767
01:22:21,930 --> 01:22:24,180
but that's the knock on bear hunting as 
well.

1768
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:26,400
The bear hunting,
the 19 nineties,

1769
01:22:26,401 --> 01:22:30,930
they outlawed dogs in California.
You can still hunt black bears.

1770
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:31,873
I guess
black bears are more accepted as a 

1771
01:22:34,981 --> 01:22:38,160
nuisance if the population grows because
you know they'll,

1772
01:22:38,161 --> 01:22:41,070
they'll find your garbage and then once 
they will say I'm as well,

1773
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:42,180
but yeah,
it's not just that.

1774
01:22:42,181 --> 01:22:44,800
Once they find your garbage,
like that'S where they go.

1775
01:22:44,830 --> 01:22:46,350
Okay.
Coming back in and day out,

1776
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,233
they're there,
they have a pattern and they develop 

1777
01:22:49,891 --> 01:22:52,770
these habits,
but they stopped using bears,

1778
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:54,113
stopped using dogs rather to hunt bears 
in California and then they stopped 

1779
01:22:56,821 --> 01:22:59,340
using baiting.
So those two things are illegal.

1780
01:22:59,370 --> 01:23:01,410
There's no baiting and there's no dog.
So good luck.

1781
01:23:01,470 --> 01:23:02,500
Bear hunting.
Yeah.

1782
01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:04,620
Especially with the bow.
Pretty tough.

1783
01:23:04,650 --> 01:23:05,483
Yeah.
Yeah.

1784
01:23:05,540 --> 01:23:06,080
The baiting

1785
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:06,641
ones,
another one,

1786
01:23:06,641 --> 01:23:08,290
like people don't like baiting and I get
it,

1787
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:09,333
you know,
we've done it.

1788
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:10,021
It's,
it's,

1789
01:23:10,021 --> 01:23:11,380
it's not the same.
No,

1790
01:23:11,381 --> 01:23:12,600
it's not the same.
It doesn't feel.

1791
01:23:12,670 --> 01:23:13,840
It's not as good.
Yeah,

1792
01:23:14,050 --> 01:23:19,050
I did it that one time with you.
And then and also like that it was still

1793
01:23:19,841 --> 01:23:21,070
good.
It was still cool,

1794
01:23:21,110 --> 01:23:21,943
you know,
and there's a tag in place and there's 

1795
01:23:23,260 --> 01:23:26,680
conservation act in place.
But just arden,

1796
01:23:26,870 --> 01:23:29,320
I've got no desire to go back.
I've done that now.

1797
01:23:29,321 --> 01:23:30,154
That's cool.
And that conservation is very important 

1798
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:34,480
for the elk population.
The moose population,

1799
01:23:34,481 --> 01:23:35,650
the deer population,
because they.

1800
01:23:35,950 --> 01:23:39,280
They killed an estimated 50 percent of 
all moose calves,

1801
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:41,410
elk calves,
dear fonds.

1802
01:23:41,710 --> 01:23:43,320
It's all black bears.
Totally.

1803
01:23:43,860 --> 01:23:47,410
And they're cannibals too.
They kill cow cubs crazy.

1804
01:23:48,410 --> 01:23:51,620
I've watched this one the other day 
because you hear people,

1805
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:56,260
I gave a bad child is male climb a tree 
and the black bay climbs a tree like,

1806
01:23:56,261 --> 01:23:57,830
I mean fucking hall.

1807
01:23:57,830 --> 01:23:59,830
I Do.
You have seen it.

1808
01:24:00,110 --> 01:24:00,943
And then there's the minimum black bear 
and she's got cubs and she goes so fast 

1809
01:24:06,071 --> 01:24:10,190
up that whole he can't climb up a tree 
to get away from a bear.

1810
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:11,530
Yeah,
geT the fuck out of here.

1811
01:24:11,531 --> 01:24:14,050
Done the big ones.
Just don't want to do it anymore,

1812
01:24:14,070 --> 01:24:16,990
but they could still like it's still do.
It could still do it.

1813
01:24:16,991 --> 01:24:19,350
Like the ideas I go to,
the big ones won't chase you up a tree.

1814
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:22,540
When you see the speed that they go up a
tree,

1815
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:25,570
then you can imagine the speed that they
come across land,

1816
01:24:26,170 --> 01:24:27,210
you know?
And it's just like,

1817
01:24:27,211 --> 01:24:28,450
ah.
Because I always say,

1818
01:24:28,630 --> 01:24:31,360
I always Tell people about that one that
was sleeping on an elk kill,

1819
01:24:31,361 --> 01:24:34,390
that I had a grizzly.
We showed that video the other day.

1820
01:24:34,710 --> 01:24:35,530
Yeah,
yeah.

1821
01:24:35,530 --> 01:24:39,670
We showed it on the podcast today and I 
remember you or yelled at that grizzly,

1822
01:24:39,671 --> 01:24:40,504
the one that was sleeping on the elk 
carcass and it fucking disappeared so 

1823
01:24:43,541 --> 01:24:45,160
fast and quietly.

1824
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:45,993
Dude.
And I'm lucky if you don't have eyes on 

1825
01:24:47,441 --> 01:24:48,274
one coming at you.
Don't know it's going to come at you 

1826
01:24:49,601 --> 01:24:52,660
until you hit until it's on your fucking
eight in your face.

1827
01:24:52,661 --> 01:24:53,494
All those pads are so soft.
The pads of the feet are so soft in 

1828
01:24:56,861 --> 01:24:57,694
order to sneak up on things.
I remember the first time I went bear 

1829
01:25:00,311 --> 01:25:03,190
hunting with cam and one was walking in.
He goes right there,

1830
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:04,113
right there,
right there.

1831
01:25:04,450 --> 01:25:05,350
I turned to look.
I'm like,

1832
01:25:05,860 --> 01:25:07,220
it's not making noise.
It was like,

1833
01:25:08,830 --> 01:25:10,060
oh,
this is a video.

1834
01:25:10,061 --> 01:25:12,280
Yeah,
here it is going up.

1835
01:25:12,281 --> 01:25:14,890
We're running dude.
Galloping up the true running.

1836
01:25:15,970 --> 01:25:17,710
Yeah,
and fucking scary sheet.

1837
01:25:17,711 --> 01:25:19,810
It doesn't stop there.
He ended up founding.

1838
01:25:20,170 --> 01:25:22,960
Hang on.
That's a black bear with cubs.

1839
01:25:23,140 --> 01:25:26,800
So you can imagine that situation with 
the grizzly and her cubs,

1840
01:25:26,860 --> 01:25:30,580
so fucking scary.
And so that's a color phase.

1841
01:25:30,810 --> 01:25:34,750
That looks like a color.
On the top is the black bear cub.

1842
01:25:35,110 --> 01:25:36,070
No,
that's it.

1843
01:25:36,130 --> 01:25:36,963
I looked like a full grown black bear.
the of color face has got a cub back up 

1844
01:25:40,181 --> 01:25:41,860
the mountain with a.

1845
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:45,300
Yeah.
That's some crazy shit.

1846
01:25:45,490 --> 01:25:47,950
Fucking boy.
toy crocodiles.

1847
01:25:47,951 --> 01:25:49,900
Don't fucking climb trees.
That's what I heard.

1848
01:25:52,580 --> 01:25:55,200
When are we doing this?
Someone started the petition.

1849
01:25:55,210 --> 01:25:57,570
I fucking.
Joe rogan needs a Australia.

1850
01:25:57,580 --> 01:25:59,110
yeah.
You keep trying to get me out there.

1851
01:25:59,111 --> 01:26:00,430
You've got snakes too though,
bro.

1852
01:26:00,431 --> 01:26:04,250
You get sponsors.
Let's fucking go over some shitty.

1853
01:26:04,970 --> 01:26:08,780
The whole season is dry.
the whole season in Australia I seen two

1854
01:26:08,781 --> 01:26:11,090
snakes.
One of them not poisonous.

1855
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:12,850
It's liKe a red belly.
Black steak.

1856
01:26:12,860 --> 01:26:14,420
Not gonna harm.
Your friendly snake.

1857
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:17,660
lawana bailey.
Poisonous snake of heresies.

1858
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:20,680
Barely.
But not very poisonous.

1859
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:26,350
My killer kid or a girl.
The audience know this giant.

1860
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:29,660
ThEy're not going to hurt you.
Talk to them.

1861
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:31,393
Fucking stay out of it.
One thing I wanted to ask you about is 

1862
01:26:33,471 --> 01:26:36,880
the thylacine the tasmanian tiger.
Yeah.

1863
01:26:36,890 --> 01:26:41,620
I read that there was credible reports 
by people in the woods.

1864
01:26:41,650 --> 01:26:44,360
They might have seen one.
I wish.

1865
01:26:45,350 --> 01:26:47,300
I don't think so either,
but it's so remote.

1866
01:26:47,940 --> 01:26:51,950
There's so many cameras now.
This guys are scouting cameras that have

1867
01:26:51,951 --> 01:26:52,784
putting it over da wallows and stuff 
like places that I would come in the 

1868
01:26:55,911 --> 01:26:57,440
drink.
That was a big animal,

1869
01:26:57,441 --> 01:26:58,210
right,
wasn't it?

1870
01:26:58,210 --> 01:26:58,730
Yeah.
Big.

1871
01:26:58,730 --> 01:26:59,563
Do they get like 100 pounds?
Something like that might be a bit 

1872
01:27:01,911 --> 01:27:02,744
bigger than that.
What a cool looking dude come on and 

1873
01:27:05,730 --> 01:27:06,570
thiS.
There it is.

1874
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:11,480
Scientists hunt for extinct tasmanian 
tiger after sightings in Australia.

1875
01:27:11,481 --> 01:27:12,740
Yeah,
that's probably what I saw.

1876
01:27:13,150 --> 01:27:18,150
I wisH the article from what year?
Oh really?

1877
01:27:19,310 --> 01:27:20,600
Interesting.
Solid.

1878
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:24,570
The extinction was driven from paypal,
right.

1879
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:25,553
Sounded like because they fucking data 
so to come in and start eating sheep or 

1880
01:27:28,431 --> 01:27:29,264
whatever.
They get shot by farmers and stuff like 

1881
01:27:30,531 --> 01:27:31,364
that.
Which is a shame and I'm sure that I 

1882
01:27:31,791 --> 01:27:34,580
didn't realize how do one of the time 
but that,

1883
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:36,230
you know,
they pushed them to extinction.

1884
01:27:36,231 --> 01:27:37,064
You know,
if there's one thing that we should 

1885
01:27:37,581 --> 01:27:40,340
bring back from extinction if we,
if it's possible.

1886
01:27:40,341 --> 01:27:42,860
I believe they should be brought back if
it's possible,

1887
01:27:42,861 --> 01:27:45,130
right.
You have some dna because uh,

1888
01:27:45,530 --> 01:27:46,363
I mean that would be nice to have some 
sort of an animal like that that could 

1889
01:27:50,750 --> 01:27:54,340
knock down some of the population goes 
and they probably,

1890
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:55,473
I probably wouldn't.
I probably just come in and devastate 

1891
01:27:57,040 --> 01:28:00,840
our lives populations and shine.

1892
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:08,160
But let me get back to why you need to 
come to snakes all year in Australia and

1893
01:28:08,540 --> 01:28:09,373
fucking seven,
eight snakes in the first month in 

1894
01:28:11,001 --> 01:28:11,834
America.
Dude,

1895
01:28:12,410 --> 01:28:16,220
17 snyder got bit the other day.
Did he did his boot.

1896
01:28:16,310 --> 01:28:19,430
Really?
I Think he was in North Carolina or some

1897
01:28:19,431 --> 01:28:20,600
shit,
I forget where it was.

1898
01:28:20,601 --> 01:28:22,700
Somewhere in the south and my buddy 
dies.

1899
01:28:23,420 --> 01:28:26,090
So this is the first hunt that I did 
when I come to America.

1900
01:28:26,091 --> 01:28:28,880
We flew into Idaho and we drove straight
down to southern Colorado,

1901
01:28:28,881 --> 01:28:32,870
the hunt pronghorn and we're driving 
into the property at like two.

1902
01:28:32,871 --> 01:28:33,704
I am in the morning and there's a 
problem home just standing on the side 

1903
01:28:35,871 --> 01:28:37,160
of the road,
you know,

1904
01:28:37,161 --> 01:28:39,140
it's just like a daze,
you know.

1905
01:28:39,650 --> 01:28:40,483
So my buddy jay's pulls up,
he walks over to it and like literally 

1906
01:28:43,071 --> 01:28:45,080
touches it on the head,
like it's like,

1907
01:28:45,081 --> 01:28:48,710
it's just like walking down the road and
we're lucky to get hit by a car.

1908
01:28:49,250 --> 01:28:50,083
next minute is I see him jump back.
A rattlesnake had bit the pronghorn and 

1909
01:28:55,401 --> 01:28:56,234
he stood,
he had a leg on neva side of the 

1910
01:28:57,261 --> 01:28:58,880
rattlesnake in.
It striked him.

1911
01:28:58,881 --> 01:29:01,070
It actually strived in twice and both 
times

1912
01:29:02,140 --> 01:29:04,230
I had to kate question and I'm like,
did that bite you?

1913
01:29:04,290 --> 01:29:05,123
And he's like,
nah.

1914
01:29:05,330 --> 01:29:07,770
I'm like,
have I think about it?

1915
01:29:07,771 --> 01:29:09,150
Did a fucking bite you?
And he's like,

1916
01:29:09,151 --> 01:29:09,984
no,
I didn't because I watched it in the 

1917
01:29:10,801 --> 01:29:14,100
headlights go for him twice.
And uh,

1918
01:29:14,190 --> 01:29:15,023
once we set up camp,
we went back there in that problem home 

1919
01:29:16,380 --> 01:29:17,970
was dead.
Had killed that problem.

1920
01:29:18,660 --> 01:29:19,860
Yeah.
I'm like,

1921
01:29:19,890 --> 01:29:24,890
fuck America.
America dryer is so much safer.

1922
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,040
A friend of mine was a hiking and he 
stayed,

1923
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:29,953
almost stepped on a rattle snake and 
jumped back and then realize it was a 

1924
01:29:33,921 --> 01:29:34,754
nest of them whole.
And there was a little one surrounding 

1925
01:29:37,011 --> 01:29:38,330
them.
They were all over the place.

1926
01:29:38,331 --> 01:29:39,850
He was like,
fuck yeah,

1927
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:41,750
jumping,
hopping around one leg after.

1928
01:29:41,780 --> 01:29:42,890
No,
no,

1929
01:29:43,140 --> 01:29:44,270
I actually had.
Um,

1930
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:46,030
but apparently that happens.

1931
01:29:46,370 --> 01:29:46,991
Yeah,
it does.

1932
01:29:46,991 --> 01:29:48,900
Yeah.
And trenchless there,

1933
01:29:48,910 --> 01:29:50,170
dude.
Everywhere.

1934
01:29:50,220 --> 01:29:51,300
There was tris trenches

1935
01:29:51,460 --> 01:29:52,480
when over the ground,
everywhere.

1936
01:29:52,481 --> 01:29:53,314
It was a bold,
the bold effort to prove the tasmanian 

1937
01:29:55,991 --> 01:29:57,970
tiger still out there.
Wildlife biologist,

1938
01:29:57,971 --> 01:29:58,804
forest gallente has brought one species 
back from the dead and he wants to do 

1939
01:30:02,681 --> 01:30:03,514
the same with the tasmanian tiger.
What the fuck is he brought back from 

1940
01:30:05,591 --> 01:30:07,390
the dead?
This goddamned frankenstein,

1941
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:09,753
unable to play the cuban saw leno.
Dawn is one of the most curious animals 

1942
01:30:15,251 --> 01:30:16,031
and plants.
Small,

1943
01:30:16,031 --> 01:30:17,620
shrewd,
shrewd.

1944
01:30:17,990 --> 01:30:20,500
It must be true like creature memo is a 
mammal,

1945
01:30:20,530 --> 01:30:22,010
but a highly venomous one.
Fuck.

1946
01:30:22,060 --> 01:30:27,060
Can't bring that back to the specimen.
Found those thought to be lost forever.

1947
01:30:27,610 --> 01:30:30,460
Then unexpectedly three were caught just
a few years later.

1948
01:30:30,461 --> 01:30:31,294
The extinct species marked on.
So that may be the case with the 

1949
01:30:34,961 --> 01:30:36,970
tasmanian tiger.
Hmm.

1950
01:30:37,220 --> 01:30:38,530
It'd be awesome.
I hope so.

1951
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:39,593
Okay.
So here it is.

1952
01:30:39,980 --> 01:30:40,813
Galantes a wildlife biologist made his 
life mission to search for animals that 

1953
01:30:42,941 --> 01:30:43,774
have wrongly been deemed extinct and 
among those species on his list of the 

1954
01:30:46,631 --> 01:30:47,464
tasmanian tiger,
a difficulty leads to like who the fuck 

1955
01:30:53,041 --> 01:30:57,340
is seen once it keeps growing.
So if anybody like legit scene when he's

1956
01:30:57,341 --> 01:30:58,174
been traveling around the world,
searching for evidence of species like 

1957
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:04,620
tasmanian devil,
a paki lemoore and the new found land,

1958
01:31:05,051 --> 01:31:07,960
white wolf still exist.
100 species deemed syncs worldwide,

1959
01:31:07,961 --> 01:31:08,794
Annual annually.
This process isn't foolproof and every 

1960
01:31:11,441 --> 01:31:12,274
now and then animals are rediscovered 
after they were thought to be gone 

1961
01:31:15,341 --> 01:31:16,174
forever.
But proving the animals still out there 

1962
01:31:17,351 --> 01:31:18,910
is no easy feat.
Hmm.

1963
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:19,833
I wonder.

1964
01:31:21,090 --> 01:31:21,923
Huh?

1965
01:31:23,090 --> 01:31:24,450
Hope so.
Yeah.

1966
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:26,413
Captured footage of a zanzibar leopard,
which is thought to be extinct for 25 

1967
01:31:30,681 --> 01:31:31,514
years due to persecution by local 
hunters in the zanzibar archipelago in 

1968
01:31:36,381 --> 01:31:38,630
tasmania.
Tanzania rather.

1969
01:31:38,631 --> 01:31:39,464
Excuse me.

1970
01:31:39,630 --> 01:31:40,463
Wow.

1971
01:31:41,370 --> 01:31:44,460
That would be pretty dope if they 
actually did find that thing.

1972
01:31:44,810 --> 01:31:46,200
It's a cool looking animal,
you know?

1973
01:31:46,310 --> 01:31:48,320
Yeah.
They can't be in good numbers anymore.

1974
01:31:48,321 --> 01:31:49,154
I know that much.

1975
01:31:49,290 --> 01:31:52,380
Tiny,
tiny number like an animal like that.

1976
01:31:52,381 --> 01:31:53,520
Like where did they live?

1977
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:56,193
Tasmania.

1978
01:31:56,770 --> 01:31:58,630
That's where the tasmanian tiger.
Tasmania tasmania's.

1979
01:31:58,631 --> 01:31:59,980
Where down the bottom

1980
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:01,210
of Australia.
The bottom?

1981
01:32:01,211 --> 01:32:03,130
Yeah.
It's a separate island.

1982
01:32:03,970 --> 01:32:06,460
Just that tiny little triangle that's 
down the bottom.

1983
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:09,280
Absolute beautiful online.
Like that's the only place they lived?

1984
01:32:09,580 --> 01:32:11,160
I believe.
So how big is that?

1985
01:32:11,170 --> 01:32:13,390
Actually?
They might've been on the mainland and I

1986
01:32:13,391 --> 01:32:15,280
think that's where the sightings have 
been.

1987
01:32:17,290 --> 01:32:20,720
Oh wow.
It's big tazzy how big is that place?

1988
01:32:21,340 --> 01:32:22,173
I don't.
No fucking big enough that they don't 

1989
01:32:24,641 --> 01:32:27,040
allow any bowhunting there.
So I've never gone.

1990
01:32:27,490 --> 01:32:29,050
Do they allow hunting?
Yeah,

1991
01:32:29,051 --> 01:32:30,670
I think you can hunt with a gun for 
fellow.

1992
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:33,090
Do might have they make you use a gun on
it?

1993
01:32:33,091 --> 01:32:33,924
Fucking.
No,

1994
01:32:35,270 --> 01:32:36,950
I was trying to get some weird rules.
Guns.

1995
01:32:37,030 --> 01:32:38,950
Oh yeah.
You guys like have a.

1996
01:32:39,310 --> 01:32:41,230
They bought up all the guns after a mass
shooting,

1997
01:32:41,231 --> 01:32:42,040
right?
Well,

1998
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:45,820
not all of them.
If you have a license holder,

1999
01:32:45,821 --> 01:32:49,900
like a shoot to shoot his license and 
you had a reason to have a gun,

2000
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:51,760
then you can still keep your guns.

2001
01:32:52,060 --> 01:32:55,090
So you had to be like a member of a gun.
I don't own any guns,

2002
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:57,430
but you had to be a member of a gun 
club.

2003
01:32:57,820 --> 01:33:01,130
I don't own any guns in Australia.
Uh,

2004
01:33:01,150 --> 01:33:01,983
you had to be a member of a gun club,
have or perhaps mission on a property 

2005
01:33:04,661 --> 01:33:05,494
where you're hunting and stuff like that
to keep the guns as they keep trying to 

2006
01:33:09,611 --> 01:33:10,444
make it tighter and tighter.
I think it's hard enough because 

2007
01:33:13,030 --> 01:33:14,530
criminals are going to get what they 
want,

2008
01:33:14,650 --> 01:33:15,341
right.
You know,

2009
01:33:15,341 --> 01:33:17,500
it's lIke how many people have been 
killed with baseball bat

2010
01:33:19,070 --> 01:33:19,903
fucking heaps.
Or you're going to be in baseball bats 

2011
01:33:21,850 --> 01:33:23,770
having people who've been killed with a 
kitchen knife,

2012
01:33:23,771 --> 01:33:24,604
you're going to bend kitchen knives.
So I think if you've got a legitimate 

2013
01:33:27,131 --> 01:33:29,050
reason to have a gun,
you know,

2014
01:33:29,051 --> 01:33:29,884
like you don't have a criminal record,
you don't have a mental illness or 

2015
01:33:31,601 --> 01:33:32,140
something like that.

2016
01:33:32,140 --> 01:33:32,973
You should have a right to have a gun.
So you do basically do a safety course 

2017
01:33:37,091 --> 01:33:37,924
and training in Australia and if you've 
got that reason to have a rifle and you 

2018
01:33:40,661 --> 01:33:43,360
can have it,
no semiautomatics,

2019
01:33:43,410 --> 01:33:44,243
um,
there's a bunch of rifles and there's a 

2020
01:33:45,431 --> 01:33:47,050
bunch of guns that you can't have in 
Australia.

2021
01:33:47,051 --> 01:33:47,884
It's pretty much like bolt action,
lever action and those rules might have 

2022
01:33:50,381 --> 01:33:52,330
changed as well.
No expert on it obviously.

2023
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:54,093
Whereas in America,
every fucking one's got an error on a 

2024
01:33:57,400 --> 01:33:58,270
mate's.
Got a gun.

2025
01:33:58,300 --> 01:33:59,133
I've got a gun too,
because if everyone else has got a goal 

2026
01:34:01,051 --> 01:34:01,884
I want a fucking gun to.
It's true isn't a true and my guns for 

2027
01:34:06,671 --> 01:34:10,870
protection when I go into the wilderness
for bears or if I'm fucking in some weed

2028
01:34:10,871 --> 01:34:11,704
destination,
someone comes in and tries to fucking 

2029
01:34:12,941 --> 01:34:14,770
rape and murder my family,
I'm going to use it.

2030
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:17,260
And uh,
yeah,

2031
01:34:17,261 --> 01:34:18,094
it's just funny Like that.
But it's crazy to think and I know it 

2032
01:34:20,291 --> 01:34:24,430
changes from place to place that anyone 
could have a gun because you know,

2033
01:34:24,431 --> 01:34:25,330
it's like,
you're right.

2034
01:34:25,990 --> 01:34:29,140
and to a certain degree,
I agree with that.

2035
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:30,730
But uh,
as well,

2036
01:34:31,480 --> 01:34:33,790
I think you lose that right?
If you've got a criminal record,

2037
01:34:33,791 --> 01:34:35,920
you've got a mental illness or something
like that,

2038
01:34:35,921 --> 01:34:37,330
then fuck.
Yeah,

2039
01:34:37,990 --> 01:34:39,610
exacTly.
We want good guys with guns.

2040
01:34:39,611 --> 01:34:41,960
Not bad guys with guns,
but bannon guns using,

2041
01:34:41,970 --> 01:34:43,750
going to stop the bad guys from having 
guns.

2042
01:34:44,910 --> 01:34:47,320
It's like trying to take p out of the 
pool.

2043
01:34:47,350 --> 01:34:49,310
Yeah,
it's fucking so much.

2044
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:52,270
there's too many now.
When you,

2045
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:54,190
uh,
when you hunt in Australia,

2046
01:34:54,250 --> 01:34:56,350
you're not allowed to use a bolt action 
rifle.

2047
01:34:56,500 --> 01:34:57,333
You can use a bolt action rifle,
like the automatic semI automatic I 

2048
01:35:00,790 --> 01:35:02,850
think in ar.
Ar,

2049
01:35:02,930 --> 01:35:03,200
yeah.

2050
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:05,480
I think pump actions have been taken out
now.

2051
01:35:05,481 --> 01:35:06,530
Things like that.
Yeah.

2052
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:08,450
Huh?
Yeah.

2053
01:35:08,451 --> 01:35:11,360
Because I want to feel like if,
especially with population control,

2054
01:35:11,361 --> 01:35:13,820
something like fallow deer,
if you have that many of them,

2055
01:35:14,160 --> 01:35:16,220
I know there's places that are just 
erupting with them.

2056
01:35:16,221 --> 01:35:17,420
You'd have to shoot him,
right?

2057
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:18,320
Yeah,
totally.

2058
01:35:18,460 --> 01:35:19,293
Yeah.
I mean there's no way you're going to 

2059
01:35:19,901 --> 01:35:22,970
have a lot of places.
It's like the whole California thing,

2060
01:35:22,971 --> 01:35:24,320
you know,
they're still getting killed,

2061
01:35:24,321 --> 01:35:27,470
but it's just a professional hitman 
that's doing it now.

2062
01:35:27,530 --> 01:35:29,450
That's not the right recreation behind 
it.

2063
01:35:29,660 --> 01:35:30,493
And in Australia,
a lot of the times it's like a good 

2064
01:35:33,501 --> 01:35:36,230
example is actually across the pond in 
New Zealand where they like,

2065
01:35:36,231 --> 01:35:38,170
fuck,
we need to shoot 30,000 ta,

2066
01:35:38,270 --> 01:35:39,103
you know,
tyler leavinG the mountains and because 

2067
01:35:40,971 --> 01:35:44,110
they are introduced or introduced and 
uh,

2068
01:35:44,300 --> 01:35:45,133
I don't think there was a lot of hunt is
arguing at the time and no one was 

2069
01:35:47,751 --> 01:35:49,990
really arguing that we needed to shoot 
some tar,

2070
01:35:49,991 --> 01:35:50,824
but we weren't like fucking shoot 30,000
of them because they shoot him from a 

2071
01:35:53,121 --> 01:35:54,920
helicopter and I leave him rod on the 
mountain.

2072
01:35:55,580 --> 01:35:58,340
They don't use any of it.
It's just a massive waste of resource,

2073
01:35:58,940 --> 01:35:59,773
you know,
and it's like you're never going to 

2074
01:36:00,621 --> 01:36:02,390
eradicate them all anyway.
And why?

2075
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:04,970
Why didn't want to shoot 30,000 of them?
Well,

2076
01:36:04,971 --> 01:36:05,804
they're introduced for starters in 
fucking politicians work of money and 

2077
01:36:08,661 --> 01:36:12,050
fucking having a job to do.
So michael loaded these things up,

2078
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:12,913
you know.
But I would think that the money would 

2079
01:36:13,671 --> 01:36:16,580
be in higher or people paying to go and 
hunt them.

2080
01:36:16,610 --> 01:36:19,040
Some of these towns live off hunters 
like that.

2081
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:19,953
Any reason that town,
he said like all their income is hunt 

2082
01:36:21,761 --> 01:36:25,010
hunters coming in hunting these 
destinations and uh,

2083
01:36:25,030 --> 01:36:28,160
that's the reason why the animals are 
there in the first place in New Zealand.

2084
01:36:28,161 --> 01:36:28,701
Yeah,
that's right.

2085
01:36:28,701 --> 01:36:29,534
Yeah.
They were all introduced as by wealthy 

2086
01:36:31,191 --> 01:36:32,024
europeans.
They wanted to make it look a hunting 

2087
01:36:33,261 --> 01:36:33,750
distAnce.
Yeah,

2088
01:36:33,750 --> 01:36:35,270
that's right.
It's so crazy.

2089
01:36:35,270 --> 01:36:38,060
They just threw a bunch of.
This is our playground.

2090
01:36:38,450 --> 01:36:39,283
What's up?
Fuck.

2091
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:40,273
Well,
new zealand's is happy for now because 

2092
01:36:41,391 --> 01:36:43,040
they've got something to hunt game 
animals.

2093
01:36:43,610 --> 01:36:44,443
But um,
if they're truly causing that much 

2094
01:36:46,041 --> 01:36:46,821
damage,
then yes,

2095
01:36:46,821 --> 01:36:48,470
obviously like feeling out the 
population,

2096
01:36:48,471 --> 01:36:50,390
but why not get hunt is involved to do 
it.

2097
01:36:50,420 --> 01:36:51,710
Why not promote hunting,
you know,

2098
01:36:51,711 --> 01:36:52,544
where the meat gets used with it were 
done properly in benefits the 

2099
01:36:55,911 --> 01:36:56,744
communities and where there's a lot of 
hunting destinations in New Zealand 

2100
01:36:59,541 --> 01:37:01,730
where people go to that are high fence 
places,

2101
01:37:01,731 --> 01:37:04,190
which is a little weird because they're 
like just.

2102
01:37:04,191 --> 01:37:06,050
I mean,
even if it's a couple hundred acres or a

2103
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:09,200
couple of times they're fenced in and 
those aren't going anywhere.

2104
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:10,073
It's just different.
It's like what we're talking about 

2105
01:37:11,151 --> 01:37:14,930
before where there's like shallow fun,
like I've never done it,

2106
01:37:14,931 --> 01:37:17,840
but I'd say that as like a shallow fun 
and then there's meaningful funds.

2107
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:20,930
Fucking walk the mountain,
find your own spot,

2108
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:23,120
you know?
Well be actual.

2109
01:37:23,570 --> 01:37:26,270
Actually go into the wild.
Don't fence the wild and,

2110
01:37:26,271 --> 01:37:29,630
and make it the not wild.
Don't make it the domestic.

2111
01:37:30,050 --> 01:37:30,883
The hard bit.
The hard bit about saying that you're 

2112
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:34,700
caucasian if you do it.
He's at benefit.

2113
01:37:34,701 --> 01:37:37,880
Some wildlife,
like there's yes and shit that have been

2114
01:37:37,881 --> 01:37:38,714
brought back from the concern list or 
nearly extinction because defense 

2115
01:37:42,020 --> 01:37:43,910
operations like in Texas,
in africa.

2116
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,350
Oh yeah.
So it's like,

2117
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:47,780
I suppose it has got its place but it's 
just,

2118
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:50,360
there's different.
There's different sorts of hunters.

2119
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:54,770
Well there's also different sizes of 
these partitions.

2120
01:37:54,830 --> 01:37:55,663
So like if you're in a place like 
there's some places in Texas that are 

2121
01:37:57,571 --> 01:38:01,740
10,000 acres,
like look that's so far beyond that.

2122
01:38:01,741 --> 01:38:05,600
Animals wild range thAt you might as 
well be in a wild.

2123
01:38:05,640 --> 01:38:07,590
Even if there's a fence,
you know,

2124
01:38:07,591 --> 01:38:08,424
80 miles in that direction,
what the fuck are you ever going to get 

2125
01:38:10,441 --> 01:38:11,790
to that fence or a deer?

2126
01:38:11,790 --> 01:38:13,110
You're not going to.
Yeah,

2127
01:38:13,111 --> 01:38:14,330
it's true.
I think I'm.

2128
01:38:14,460 --> 01:38:15,910
Maybe I'm a little bit closed minded on 
it.

2129
01:38:15,930 --> 01:38:17,010
It's the same thing.
To me,

2130
01:38:17,160 --> 01:38:20,520
it's like ideologically the same thing.
I agree with you.

2131
01:38:20,521 --> 01:38:22,230
It feels I've,
you know,

2132
01:38:22,231 --> 01:38:24,210
I've seen those places.
It seems weird.

2133
01:38:24,710 --> 01:38:25,543
It's like jurassic park.
You go through these giant gates and 

2134
01:38:27,271 --> 01:38:29,580
inside those animals are fenced in.
They never getting out.

2135
01:38:30,270 --> 01:38:31,103
You know,
they're in there.

2136
01:38:31,260 --> 01:38:33,540
There's no mystery,
there's no mystery.

2137
01:38:33,550 --> 01:38:35,010
That's.
And I like,

2138
01:38:35,850 --> 01:38:38,490
I liked the file.
You're in hunting as much as I liked the

2139
01:38:38,491 --> 01:38:39,324
success.
If you call like killing an animal to 

2140
01:38:40,741 --> 01:38:42,270
success,
but you know,

2141
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:45,950
I liked that.
The opportunity and you do everything in

2142
01:38:45,951 --> 01:38:48,030
you fucking pals steal your work your 
ass off.

2143
01:38:48,031 --> 01:38:48,864
You know,
you're fucking figured to bleed if they 

2144
01:38:50,641 --> 01:38:51,960
have to do,
to get to the end of it.

2145
01:38:51,961 --> 01:38:52,794
But I liked the idea that you can still 
file in a hunt and I locked filing on a 

2146
01:38:55,981 --> 01:38:58,110
hunt sometimes because it makes you 
realize,

2147
01:38:58,650 --> 01:39:00,480
fuck,
this is hard.

2148
01:39:00,540 --> 01:39:02,830
So the next time imagine everything gets
shot out.

2149
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:05,400
Just smoked a fucking.
Give it away in a day.

2150
01:39:05,910 --> 01:39:08,820
I wouldn't be interested in.
It will be like farming.

2151
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:09,713
That's right.
I liked that file you because it makes 

2152
01:39:11,041 --> 01:39:13,830
you realize how fucking old somebody is 
when you get something.

2153
01:39:13,990 --> 01:39:14,790
Well,
it also,

2154
01:39:14,790 --> 01:39:15,623
it's different between hunting in any 
other way that you get meat because 

2155
01:39:19,830 --> 01:39:24,830
because it is so difficult and It 
requires skill planning,

2156
01:39:25,230 --> 01:39:27,990
intelligence,
you have to have knowledge.

2157
01:39:28,050 --> 01:39:30,870
You have to know how to play the wind.
You have to know when to move,

2158
01:39:30,871 --> 01:39:34,410
when to not move.
It's a tactical situation where you have

2159
01:39:34,411 --> 01:39:38,280
to use the right tactics to get in on 
this animal or it was going to smell you

2160
01:39:38,281 --> 01:39:39,114
or hear you or see you.
There's so muCh involved in it that's 

2161
01:39:42,001 --> 01:39:42,834
not involved.
If you're just acquiring meat and the 

2162
01:39:45,050 --> 01:39:47,040
other way and that's what it should take
two,

2163
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:50,220
because we have taken an animal's life 
so it should take that effort,

2164
01:39:50,490 --> 01:39:53,100
you know,
and then it's like you put so muCh heart

2165
01:39:53,101 --> 01:39:56,760
and soul into it that even if you cut 
the meat up and is like roddy and puffy,

2166
01:39:56,761 --> 01:39:57,301
like,
fuck,

2167
01:39:57,301 --> 01:39:58,170
this is delicious.

2168
01:39:58,170 --> 01:39:59,003
Yeah.
Well you were talking about your elk 

2169
01:40:00,421 --> 01:40:01,254
hunt in New Mexico this year and how 
difficult it was and you guys were out 

2170
01:40:03,661 --> 01:40:05,300
there for over a month.
Yeah.

2171
01:40:05,450 --> 01:40:06,283
Yeah.
Well we did.

2172
01:40:06,630 --> 01:40:11,630
We did a Oregon.
We did New Mexico and we did Montana for

2173
01:40:12,721 --> 01:40:14,790
elk and which is like boston.
How awesome.

2174
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:16,320
the whole time,
you know.

2175
01:40:16,321 --> 01:40:17,154
and then I ended up getting one though.
It was like the one I actually really 

2176
01:40:19,681 --> 01:40:23,640
just wanted kim to get a shootable 
hoofers ball because she's been going at

2177
01:40:23,641 --> 01:40:24,930
it.
And uh,

2178
01:40:25,170 --> 01:40:29,020
the one afternoon that she took off 
because she was doing some homeschooling

2179
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:30,930
with the kids and trying to get on top 
of all that,

2180
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:32,333
the perfect opportunity popped up and I 
ended up shooting his bowl and then we 

2181
01:40:35,430 --> 01:40:37,500
never had a good opportunity again.
You know,

2182
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:38,913
we just stopped.
But the thing is that that's made a 

2183
01:40:40,570 --> 01:40:42,450
hungrier for it next,
this season,

2184
01:40:42,640 --> 01:40:44,490
you know,
like she realizes how hard are.

2185
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:46,920
They just have difficulties in general.
Appreciate it much more.

2186
01:40:46,921 --> 01:40:47,970
That's what it should be.
Well,

2187
01:40:47,971 --> 01:40:51,630
it's cool that she is determined that 
it's not discouraging her,

2188
01:40:51,730 --> 01:40:53,980
that the difficulty oftentimes for a

2189
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:55,540
lot of people that difficulty because 
it's,

2190
01:40:55,560 --> 01:40:55,950
you know,
you're,

2191
01:40:55,950 --> 01:40:57,790
you're out there seven days,
10 days,

2192
01:40:57,791 --> 01:40:59,560
your feet are killing you.
You're exhausted.

2193
01:40:59,860 --> 01:41:00,340
You,
you're like,

2194
01:41:00,340 --> 01:41:01,790
I'm just going to go to the fucking 
soup.

2195
01:41:03,190 --> 01:41:04,770
I'm going to get a rifle.
Yeah.

2196
01:41:05,010 --> 01:41:05,843
Kim is actually a really good example of
what a lot of your audience would be 

2197
01:41:08,970 --> 01:41:11,390
because kim's really been that city 
girl,

2198
01:41:11,510 --> 01:41:12,310
you know,
like,

2199
01:41:12,310 --> 01:41:14,230
that's,
that's just been a life,

2200
01:41:14,250 --> 01:41:16,910
you know.
And then I had,

2201
01:41:16,940 --> 01:41:21,100
it took about seven years to convince 
her to eat fucking venison game.

2202
01:41:21,550 --> 01:41:22,383
Yeah.
Yeah.

2203
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:23,233
And how I did it was I shot a deer and 
it was just like a nice healthy young 

2204
01:41:27,831 --> 01:41:28,664
deer.
And I cut the back straps in the 

2205
01:41:30,291 --> 01:41:31,124
caitlyn,
so I think you guys call them tomahawk 

2206
01:41:32,121 --> 01:41:34,260
steaks.
So we call them color.

2207
01:41:34,270 --> 01:41:36,800
It's like cut it into cutlets and it 
just looked like lamb cutlets.

2208
01:41:36,801 --> 01:41:39,290
Dude.
And I cooked up these land cutlets and I

2209
01:41:39,291 --> 01:41:44,120
served it and she fucking loved it.
Like her and the kids were just like,

2210
01:41:44,121 --> 01:41:44,954
this is delicious.
I think I actually only had my oldest 

2211
01:41:46,611 --> 01:41:48,920
boy hunter at the time,
like this delicious.

2212
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:52,040
And I loved it.
And then unlike that's venison that d,

2213
01:41:52,340 --> 01:41:53,870
because it was just the images,
I hide it,

2214
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:55,730
but I had no idea what the meat tastes 
like.

2215
01:41:55,731 --> 01:41:57,890
She had no idea shooting cute little 
deer.

2216
01:41:57,891 --> 01:41:58,670
yeah.
Yeah.

2217
01:41:58,670 --> 01:41:59,503
And now it's the opposite where she 
doesn't feel as comfortable eating an 

2218
01:42:03,170 --> 01:42:05,390
animal that she doesn't know about,
you know,

2219
01:42:05,690 --> 01:42:06,523
because if,
if we put venison in the fridge freezer 

2220
01:42:09,700 --> 01:42:12,350
like an ava goes past just kim's handle 
my hands,

2221
01:42:12,380 --> 01:42:13,270
that's it.
You know,

2222
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:15,380
where the animal come from,
you know that it was healthy,

2223
01:42:15,650 --> 01:42:17,120
you know,
everything like that.

2224
01:42:17,810 --> 01:42:20,660
And Then coconut and eaten it and she 
feels a lot more.

2225
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:24,080
And I'm not trying to Put anyone down at
buys me because like I said,

2226
01:42:24,081 --> 01:42:25,910
I still buy me too and there's nothing 
wrong with that.

2227
01:42:25,911 --> 01:42:27,950
That's the population of the world 
demands that.

2228
01:42:28,550 --> 01:42:29,383
But there's something that you don't 
feel as guilty about cooking your own 

2229
01:42:32,580 --> 01:42:33,413
meals.
There's some sort of connection there 

2230
01:42:34,490 --> 01:42:37,380
that goes way beyond my birth,
you know.

2231
01:42:37,720 --> 01:42:40,280
Whereas like a real connection with 
hunting and eating the meat.

2232
01:42:40,690 --> 01:42:44,140
My littlest daughter loves fishing,
loves it and loves it.

2233
01:42:44,141 --> 01:42:47,950
We go fishing together and we caught 
yellow tail in Hawaii.

2234
01:42:48,020 --> 01:42:51,970
Nice cooked it.
Had the chef actually cook it in turn.

2235
01:42:52,120 --> 01:42:52,953
We stayed at a hotel and you bring it to
the chef and the at the restaurant and 

2236
01:42:56,531 --> 01:43:01,531
he would make shimmy out of it and made 
some j and it was so good,

2237
01:43:01,751 --> 01:43:04,000
but she loves it.
She loves it.

2238
01:43:04,001 --> 01:43:04,834
She caught something and brought it in 
and she wants everyone to know that 

2239
01:43:09,070 --> 01:43:11,570
you're eating something that she caught.
Yeah.

2240
01:43:12,730 --> 01:43:14,220
It's so cool.
Yeah.

2241
01:43:14,290 --> 01:43:15,370
That's a good feeling.
Well,

2242
01:43:15,371 --> 01:43:18,610
it's also connecting her with the what,
what a fish is,

2243
01:43:18,611 --> 01:43:19,270
you know,
you go,

2244
01:43:19,270 --> 01:43:21,250
she likes sushi.
She's had sushi before.

2245
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:25,310
now she's having sushi that she was 
there when the thing died,

2246
01:43:25,690 --> 01:43:28,180
she caught it.
She pulled it out of the ocean.

2247
01:43:28,710 --> 01:43:30,730
You know,
we took the hook out of it's mouth.

2248
01:43:30,731 --> 01:43:35,731
We filleted it like the whole deal.
She saw shot every step of the way,

2249
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:37,410
you know,
so

2250
01:43:37,410 --> 01:43:39,570
they're still like a connection in 
paypal.

2251
01:43:39,571 --> 01:43:43,280
That's like it sparks up again when I do
something because we'd done that for

2252
01:43:43,860 --> 01:43:46,170
forever forever.
When you catch a fish,

2253
01:43:46,500 --> 01:43:48,150
when it's on the,
like the excitement,

2254
01:43:48,470 --> 01:43:49,303
like it doesn't necessarily even make 
sense if there's not some sort of a 

2255
01:43:52,701 --> 01:43:56,240
genetic component to it because the 
excitement is so visceral.

2256
01:43:56,270 --> 01:43:58,160
It's so like it's genetic

2257
01:43:58,680 --> 01:43:59,513
bad.
It's like what'd you do on pulling into 

2258
01:44:00,131 --> 01:44:02,600
law and it's got some light on it.
Been spin

2259
01:44:03,090 --> 01:44:03,923
on the.
First of all she wouldn't let anyone 

2260
01:44:06,361 --> 01:44:08,710
help her.
She like wanted to do it her.

2261
01:44:08,820 --> 01:44:12,960
She's awesome and she's got a 10 pound 
yellowtail and this thing

2262
01:44:14,520 --> 01:44:16,910
and I'm helping her by holding onto the 
rock.

2263
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:20,310
That's all I'm doing because
you know,

2264
01:44:20,340 --> 01:44:22,650
so I'm holding the rod to make sure it 
doesn't.

2265
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:25,050
And she's got two hands on the crank and
she's.

2266
01:44:26,660 --> 01:44:27,750
But she wouldn't give up.
I go,

2267
01:44:27,751 --> 01:44:28,950
what do you want me to help you?
just like,

2268
01:44:28,951 --> 01:44:30,170
no,
that's awesome.

2269
01:44:30,180 --> 01:44:31,013
Yeah.
She was so determined because when she 

2270
01:44:32,851 --> 01:44:35,850
did do it and brought it in,
the thrill was so powerful.

2271
01:44:35,851 --> 01:44:37,500
She wanted to be the one that brought it
in.

2272
01:44:37,570 --> 01:44:39,130
Yeah.
It's so cool.

2273
01:44:39,131 --> 01:44:39,964
Yeah.
I really believe there's like this 

2274
01:44:40,900 --> 01:44:42,910
ancient connection.
One hundred percent.

2275
01:44:43,060 --> 01:44:44,470
Yeah.
And it's like with hunting,

2276
01:44:44,471 --> 01:44:47,680
and I'll do a hunting a lot now,
so it's,

2277
01:44:48,010 --> 01:44:48,843
I feel like I'm in my element,
but even the first time that I shot 

2278
01:44:51,011 --> 01:44:56,011
something and I was cutting it up for me
was I felt so comfortable doing it in.

2279
01:44:56,660 --> 01:44:58,360
It's like a,
it was like,

2280
01:44:58,361 --> 01:45:00,040
I've done this a million times before.

2281
01:45:00,310 --> 01:45:03,220
A lot of people say the same thing.
A lot of people say the same thing,

2282
01:45:03,221 --> 01:45:05,740
that brian callen in fact said the same 
thing.

2283
01:45:05,741 --> 01:45:07,800
And he and I went hunting for the first 
time and he's like,

2284
01:45:07,801 --> 01:45:09,610
it just seems like something we've 
always done.

2285
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:14,410
Like there's a memory in our dna and 
this is how we've survived.

2286
01:45:14,411 --> 01:45:17,520
It was a great thrill.
If you ca,

2287
01:45:17,650 --> 01:45:19,540
if you shot a deer,
you know,

2288
01:45:19,541 --> 01:45:22,360
10,000,
20,000 years ago and you manage to bring

2289
01:45:22,361 --> 01:45:23,710
that back to the village.
Like,

2290
01:45:23,711 --> 01:45:25,330
holy shit,
everybody's eating good.

2291
01:45:25,900 --> 01:45:27,550
We're going to get by,
we're going to survive.

2292
01:45:27,551 --> 01:45:29,320
Or children are going to get nutrition.

2293
01:45:29,480 --> 01:45:31,770
Yeah.
Is this deep and meaningful feeling?

2294
01:45:31,771 --> 01:45:32,880
And it's not like your shot.

2295
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:33,960
Yeah.
Yeah.

2296
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:35,970
Fucking shot it.
That feeling.

2297
01:45:36,460 --> 01:45:39,240
you feel excited,
you feel you like,

2298
01:45:39,241 --> 01:45:40,290
yes,
yes,

2299
01:45:40,291 --> 01:45:42,720
yes.
But it's a different kind of excitement.

2300
01:45:42,721 --> 01:45:45,750
It's a,
it's sustenance.

2301
01:45:46,590 --> 01:45:50,640
You're going to get nutrients,
you're going to feed your family,

2302
01:45:50,790 --> 01:45:54,960
you're gonna and it's all because you 
did it the way you did.

2303
01:45:54,980 --> 01:45:56,490
Especially bow hunting.
You know,

2304
01:45:56,491 --> 01:45:58,800
how difficult it is and you pulled it 
off.

2305
01:45:58,801 --> 01:45:59,634
There's this thrill of success.
and then there's this deep connection 

2306
01:46:03,211 --> 01:46:04,080
with your meat.
You know,

2307
01:46:04,200 --> 01:46:07,650
when I get an elk,
I kind of love eating that stuff.

2308
01:46:07,651 --> 01:46:09,750
so when I get one,
I'm like,

2309
01:46:09,751 --> 01:46:11,010
now,
good.

2310
01:46:11,011 --> 01:46:11,844
Now I've got meat,
I've got meat from months and I've made 

2311
01:46:14,040 --> 01:46:16,350
my friends have meat.
I have a fucking.

2312
01:46:16,650 --> 01:46:20,100
I have a gang of canadian friends that 
are eating elk all the time.

2313
01:46:20,101 --> 01:46:21,080
No,
because you know,

2314
01:46:21,150 --> 01:46:25,470
I give them sausages and steaks and I 
teach them like my friend tom papa,

2315
01:46:26,280 --> 01:46:27,090
he,
uh,

2316
01:46:27,090 --> 01:46:27,923
I've,
I've taught them how to like cook elk 

2317
01:46:29,401 --> 01:46:30,600
roasts,
you know,

2318
01:46:30,601 --> 01:46:32,400
like he was like,
what do I do?

2319
01:46:32,430 --> 01:46:34,320
I'm like,
you got to keep it low and slow.

2320
01:46:34,321 --> 01:46:35,154
You want like 275 degrees,
get it to an internal temperature of 

2321
01:46:38,461 --> 01:46:40,200
135,
somewhere around.

2322
01:46:40,220 --> 01:46:41,340
then.
Then you pull it,

2323
01:46:41,341 --> 01:46:43,740
sear it on the outside,
let it sit for 10 minutes.

2324
01:46:44,190 --> 01:46:46,950
He calls me up a couple of hours later.
Holy shit.

2325
01:46:47,070 --> 01:46:47,903
I'm like,
yeah,

2326
01:46:48,190 --> 01:46:50,100
that didn't like any of anything else 
you're going to eat

2327
01:46:50,120 --> 01:46:52,860
anyway.
It's because the hunt starts will.

2328
01:46:52,861 --> 01:46:53,694
The hunt probablY starts here for you 
because you practice and shoot your 

2329
01:46:55,621 --> 01:46:58,230
target and then you go through all the 
preparation.

2330
01:46:58,231 --> 01:47:00,210
You go for the hunt,
you're successful,

2331
01:47:00,211 --> 01:47:01,044
you kill the animal.
The hunt doesn't end at killing the 

2332
01:47:02,971 --> 01:47:03,804
animal that hunt continues to go and 
like you ate and the animal on your 

2333
01:47:07,160 --> 01:47:09,090
plight.
That's the feeling that I get.

2334
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:10,313
You know,
it's like and that that sometimes I'm 

2335
01:47:11,881 --> 01:47:14,130
like,
it's like why people call me a hunter?

2336
01:47:14,131 --> 01:47:16,080
I'm just a human.
This is a human thing to do.

2337
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:17,970
Like go out,
catch your own,

2338
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,710
cook it,
eat to survive.

2339
01:47:19,890 --> 01:47:23,160
Continued is weird that it's so rare 
now.

2340
01:47:23,190 --> 01:47:25,440
Yeah.
So how rare is it in Australia?

2341
01:47:25,441 --> 01:47:27,710
Like population wise,
auto night?

2342
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:30,330
Fuck all.
There's not a lot of hunters.

2343
01:47:30,450 --> 01:47:31,283
I feel like there is,
because I'm in hunting the hunting 

2344
01:47:32,971 --> 01:47:35,460
community,
so I know a lot of hunters,

2345
01:47:35,820 --> 01:47:40,050
but if I go to any given person's house,
that's not.

2346
01:47:40,680 --> 01:47:42,420
Most of my friends are hunters as well 
now,

2347
01:47:42,421 --> 01:47:44,730
but if say I'll go to one of kim's 
friends' houses.

2348
01:47:45,120 --> 01:47:46,940
there's not one hunt is in that house.
Right.

2349
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:48,810
You know,
and then I'll go to a workplace.

2350
01:47:48,811 --> 01:47:51,750
There's no hunters in that workplace.
Like it doesn't come up.

2351
01:47:51,751 --> 01:47:52,960
No one's they.
oh,

2352
01:47:52,980 --> 01:47:54,750
it's so weird that you what you do,
you know,

2353
01:47:54,751 --> 01:47:56,970
it's not,
it's not like that.

2354
01:47:56,971 --> 01:47:59,850
Even though it's a part of my family's 
heritage,

2355
01:47:59,851 --> 01:48:03,980
like I'm like my grandfather,
he would go out trapping.

2356
01:48:03,990 --> 01:48:06,420
My uncles had got trapped in.
My dad would do a bit of hunting,

2357
01:48:06,421 --> 01:48:07,920
not bow hunting,
and it was different,

2358
01:48:07,921 --> 01:48:08,754
you know,
and it was almost like it wasn't even 

2359
01:48:10,501 --> 01:48:11,334
called hunting back then.
That's what I always think about our 

2360
01:48:12,601 --> 01:48:13,880
ancestors,
like hunting's,

2361
01:48:13,881 --> 01:48:14,714
like almost like a modern word that we 
made up because it would have just been 

2362
01:48:17,701 --> 01:48:19,660
something they do.
It was just normal.

2363
01:48:19,670 --> 01:48:21,540
We're hunting,
but everybody does exactly.

2364
01:48:21,541 --> 01:48:24,030
When you wash your clothes,
do you call yourself a clothes washer?

2365
01:48:24,120 --> 01:48:27,120
Pull this thing in front of you know it 
this way.

2366
01:48:27,510 --> 01:48:30,440
You're good under your consent.
Weird.

2367
01:48:31,770 --> 01:48:32,950
There you go.
clear?

2368
01:48:33,090 --> 01:48:34,710
Yeah.
It's like if You wash your clothes,

2369
01:48:36,120 --> 01:48:39,690
no fuck no one washes clothes unless 
you're a dirty prick.

2370
01:48:39,930 --> 01:48:41,280
You know,
everyone does that.

2371
01:48:41,340 --> 01:48:42,780
But because people know that I hunt,

2372
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:47,760
people will find me like in like a,
there's a guy like similar and you know,

2373
01:48:47,761 --> 01:48:48,594
like he wants to meet me somewhere.
It's like the first thing that comes up 

2374
01:48:51,181 --> 01:48:54,780
almost like instantly we know each 
other.

2375
01:48:55,090 --> 01:48:57,640
Do you bow hunt?
Yeah.

2376
01:48:59,130 --> 01:49:00,930
Cool.
Where do you go?

2377
01:49:00,931 --> 01:49:01,540
I was like,
oh,

2378
01:49:01,540 --> 01:49:03,000
you know,
we go to New Mexico every year.

2379
01:49:03,030 --> 01:49:03,863
Oh,
cool.

2380
01:49:04,290 --> 01:49:05,700
On your fucking business.
Yeah.

2381
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:08,640
That,
yeah.

2382
01:49:08,770 --> 01:49:13,610
You and John Dudley had that talk about 
public spots and you're like,

2383
01:49:14,930 --> 01:49:17,580
because I agree it's not your,
like you don't own it.

2384
01:49:17,940 --> 01:49:20,580
Everyone owns public land,
but uh,

2385
01:49:20,610 --> 01:49:23,490
I'll take this story back out for john.
But um,

2386
01:49:24,120 --> 01:49:24,953
to share that spot is
not the done thing because it's like 

2387
01:49:30,511 --> 01:49:31,344
everyone should put their own in a sense
to go find a spot to go find a spot and 

2388
01:49:35,380 --> 01:49:36,213
even if you're happy to share a spot,
because I go to a lot of different 

2389
01:49:38,131 --> 01:49:41,940
sports and social media ask me to tell 
these sports and I never do because that

2390
01:49:41,941 --> 01:49:42,774
spot could be someone else's paradise 
that they fucking spent 10 years to 

2391
01:49:45,631 --> 01:49:46,464
find.
Then you give that information out to 

2392
01:49:48,251 --> 01:49:51,290
the masses is so don't fucking ask,
you know,

2393
01:49:51,310 --> 01:49:52,500
that's the thing.
Yeah,

2394
01:49:52,510 --> 01:49:53,231
that's the thing,
right?

2395
01:49:53,231 --> 01:49:54,064
It's like,
even though these are beautiful and 

2396
01:49:55,361 --> 01:49:56,194
everybody owns them,
the last thing you want is what's 

2397
01:49:57,401 --> 01:50:02,401
happening right now in joshua tree,
right in the fucking trash everywhere.

2398
01:50:03,430 --> 01:50:05,350
Well that's one thing I really like 
about what you do too.

2399
01:50:05,351 --> 01:50:08,260
You always make videos of these trash 
that you pick up,

2400
01:50:08,261 --> 01:50:10,330
you pick,
bring a bag with you and your will.

2401
01:50:10,331 --> 01:50:11,164
I started a thing.
So I brought a bunch of gateway with me 

2402
01:50:12,671 --> 01:50:13,504
and I'm fortunate I've got really good 
sponsors and they sent me a bunch of 

2403
01:50:15,761 --> 01:50:17,860
gear as well.
So I could do the trip over here without

2404
01:50:17,861 --> 01:50:18,694
bringing everything and I was walking 
around New Mexico actually and I was 

2405
01:50:22,031 --> 01:50:24,760
looking at all the trash sitting around 
and I was like,

2406
01:50:24,761 --> 01:50:25,594
fuck it,
I'm going to give away all my equipment 

2407
01:50:27,131 --> 01:50:27,964
for this trip.
Virtually all my mind hunting gave 

2408
01:50:29,651 --> 01:50:32,760
backpack bow,
frigging yeti cool.

2409
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:33,633
Whatever,
you know.

2410
01:50:34,120 --> 01:50:34,953
And for anyone that tags me In an image 
of them picking up trash and I'm not 

2411
01:50:38,861 --> 01:50:42,670
going to say the description of it now 
because it's pretty much ended up giving

2412
01:50:42,671 --> 01:50:43,504
the bottle of wine and all my gear and 
because these hundreds of doing that 

2413
01:50:46,871 --> 01:50:47,704
anyway,
but I just thought I'd really drive it 

2414
01:50:48,701 --> 01:50:49,534
home,
you know,

2415
01:50:49,990 --> 01:50:50,823
and thousands and thousands of people 
tag me and then collecting rubbish out 

2416
01:50:54,791 --> 01:50:56,980
in public lands or wherever.

2417
01:50:57,400 --> 01:50:59,210
You know,
those people that would post the knee,

2418
01:50:59,270 --> 01:51:01,840
they'll picking it up on the beach right
here in la,

2419
01:51:01,841 --> 01:51:02,950
you know,
collecting rubbish.

2420
01:51:02,951 --> 01:51:03,784
So it was.
Because it's disheartening when you got 

2421
01:51:05,891 --> 01:51:07,870
that connection to the wall and you see 
that,

2422
01:51:07,871 --> 01:51:08,651
you know,
like fuck,

2423
01:51:08,651 --> 01:51:09,780
that doesn't belong here.
You know,

2424
01:51:09,850 --> 01:51:11,170
those loans,
those balloons.

2425
01:51:11,171 --> 01:51:14,620
I float away.
They needed the band name fucking things

2426
01:51:14,710 --> 01:51:19,330
because they dropped someone walks out,
they let them go out somewhere.

2427
01:51:19,331 --> 01:51:20,590
It's usually on the mountain,
you know,

2428
01:51:20,610 --> 01:51:22,060
the mountain ends up catching them,
you know,

2429
01:51:23,030 --> 01:51:28,030
it just doesn't belong there.
I was on the trail yesterday with my dog

2430
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:29,273
and came across as bud light can I just 
stopped and just staring at this candle 

2431
01:51:33,161 --> 01:51:33,994
on the ground.
I'm wanting to find the guy who didn't 

2432
01:51:34,751 --> 01:51:37,240
shove it down his fucking throat.
What person does.

2433
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:40,690
I always think of that.
I'm like,

2434
01:51:40,691 --> 01:51:41,540
who would do that?

2435
01:51:41,690 --> 01:51:43,560
It's such a beautiful place and just 
being like,

2436
01:51:44,130 --> 01:51:46,240
fuck it,
leave it behind.

2437
01:51:46,300 --> 01:51:48,570
I say it everywhere like because a lot 
of people were like,

2438
01:51:48,580 --> 01:51:50,520
I want to apologize on behalf of 
America.

2439
01:51:50,521 --> 01:51:51,370
I'm like,
fuck,

2440
01:51:51,970 --> 01:51:53,710
that's not America.
That's everywhere.

2441
01:51:53,711 --> 01:51:54,544
That's people everywhere.
But there's certain places that people 

2442
01:51:57,591 --> 01:51:59,890
are.
There's different people.

2443
01:52:00,010 --> 01:52:00,843
New zealand's one of them.
So New Zealand has like hundreds and 

2444
01:52:04,390 --> 01:52:06,830
hundreds of public land cabins.
Yeah,

2445
01:52:07,320 --> 01:52:10,050
like no fee.
Pretty much nothing but any.

2446
01:52:10,051 --> 01:52:10,884
If there is a phase like five bucks and 
you can hike in or drive the day's 

2447
01:52:13,811 --> 01:52:16,210
cabins and you stay in there and they've
gotten mattresses in them,

2448
01:52:16,211 --> 01:52:18,640
they got beds,
they got the firewood,

2449
01:52:19,070 --> 01:52:19,903
it's left there by the hunters or 
outdoors people before you and they are 

2450
01:52:22,931 --> 01:52:25,450
in pristine condition and there's a 
guest book to write.

2451
01:52:25,830 --> 01:52:29,100
You're signing the guest book.
If that was in Australia,

2452
01:52:29,140 --> 01:52:31,870
if that was in America would be so 
fucking vandalize.

2453
01:52:31,871 --> 01:52:32,704
IT's not funny,
but new zealand's got a certain type of 

2454
01:52:34,841 --> 01:52:37,270
people that go into the app,
the bush,

2455
01:52:37,510 --> 01:52:40,450
the mountains,
and there's a certain respect that comes

2456
01:52:40,451 --> 01:52:43,570
with it and maybe it's from maori 
culture or something like that that goes

2457
01:52:43,571 --> 01:52:46,100
with it.
Where where that just

2458
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:48,960
doesn't happen.
The person that's here before you cleans

2459
01:52:48,980 --> 01:52:50,090
that out,
they sweep it out,

2460
01:52:50,091 --> 01:52:50,924
they clean it,
they leave a bit of tin food there or 

2461
01:52:52,641 --> 01:52:53,960
whatever.
They cut new firewood.

2462
01:52:53,961 --> 01:52:55,820
They stack it where it can stay dry.
You know,

2463
01:52:56,390 --> 01:52:57,223
things like that and it's and,
and it's something that goes about 

2464
01:52:59,270 --> 01:53:01,820
signing with me and my people,
how we sort of do.

2465
01:53:01,821 --> 01:53:03,590
That's how we are respectful for the 
land,

2466
01:53:03,591 --> 01:53:05,820
but there's so many people that aren't.
That's okay.

2467
01:53:05,910 --> 01:53:08,220
Beautiful thing.
If you find a community like that,

2468
01:53:08,221 --> 01:53:11,520
that everybody agrees to respect that 
area,

2469
01:53:11,521 --> 01:53:13,740
everybody agrees to do that and take 
care of things.

2470
01:53:13,741 --> 01:53:14,574
I mean,
if you can really come across something 

2471
01:53:15,421 --> 01:53:16,254
like that,
like where you're talking about New 

2472
01:53:17,210 --> 01:53:19,500
Zealand is a just a great feeling of 
community there.

2473
01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:20,490
yeah,
totally.

2474
01:53:20,810 --> 01:53:23,460
There's a.
Seems to be a tight hunting community in

2475
01:53:23,461 --> 01:53:25,920
America as well.
We're obviously none of that thing would

2476
01:53:25,921 --> 01:53:26,754
happen,
but there's so many people that go out 

2477
01:53:28,350 --> 01:53:29,183
into the outdoors that they belong to,
so I don't want to say that I didn't 

2478
01:53:33,071 --> 01:53:35,550
belong there,
but the truth is as soon as you later or

2479
01:53:35,551 --> 01:53:36,820
something,
you don't fuCking belong there.

2480
01:53:37,290 --> 01:53:39,450
Yeah.
Fucking trashy house,

2481
01:53:39,451 --> 01:53:40,284
you know?

2482
01:53:40,570 --> 01:53:42,520
Yeah.
It's just so unfortunate.

2483
01:53:42,521 --> 01:53:45,730
It's unfortunate that people do think 
like that.

2484
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:46,593
They think so selfishly.
They just throw a water bottle on the 

2485
01:53:48,191 --> 01:53:49,210
ground.
They don't care.

2486
01:53:49,960 --> 01:53:51,760
No one's going to notice it's out here 
in the wilderness.

2487
01:53:51,890 --> 01:53:53,570
That's what it is.
It's that so,

2488
01:53:53,770 --> 01:53:57,890
so self centered that is like no one or 
nothing else matters,

2489
01:53:57,891 --> 01:54:00,680
You know,
when so much of that.

2490
01:54:01,070 --> 01:54:01,903
So much of that.
And that's what I think is getting 

2491
01:54:02,991 --> 01:54:05,690
worse.
What's people doing?

2492
01:54:05,691 --> 01:54:08,000
A poor job of raising people,
you know,

2493
01:54:08,300 --> 01:54:10,310
they're not paying attention.
Yeah.

2494
01:54:11,660 --> 01:54:12,493
Raising shitty humans.
I want to fight it like I've constantly 

2495
01:54:15,471 --> 01:54:17,450
been fighting it and that's why I have a
social,

2496
01:54:17,800 --> 01:54:18,633
the social media and stuff to keep 
promoting the outdoors and good things 

2497
01:54:21,231 --> 01:54:22,064
in life and things like that.
But another pod tummies like and I 

2498
01:54:25,221 --> 01:54:27,230
nearly did it last year.
I just like fuck,

2499
01:54:27,231 --> 01:54:31,370
I'll want to go off the grid like,
like really off the grid.

2500
01:54:31,371 --> 01:54:32,950
So solar power,
you know,

2501
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:33,793
a couple of thousand acres of and stuff 
like that and just cause came pretty 

2502
01:54:37,971 --> 01:54:39,780
much any age game made it now as well.

2503
01:54:39,780 --> 01:54:40,613
Like that's how we've gotten.
So we just want to gain weight and it's 

2504
01:54:42,191 --> 01:54:44,900
like the next step would be having our 
own chickens,

2505
01:54:45,290 --> 01:54:47,900
collecting our own eggs,
growing our own vegetables,

2506
01:54:47,901 --> 01:54:49,310
like living off the land,
you know?

2507
01:54:49,550 --> 01:54:52,480
Do you want to have like a phone out?
Fuck no.

2508
01:54:52,670 --> 01:54:54,590
So how long would you lIve out there 
for?

2509
01:54:54,620 --> 01:54:56,150
Forever.
Forever and ever.

2510
01:54:56,151 --> 01:54:58,100
And ever.
How am I going to get in touch with you?

2511
01:54:59,490 --> 01:55:01,450
I'll have a phone or your number and I'm
like,

2512
01:55:02,610 --> 01:55:04,760
eh.
I just felt like cottonseed oil out,

2513
01:55:05,340 --> 01:55:08,030
fucking cut and bills out,
cutting all that shit out.

2514
01:55:08,031 --> 01:55:10,040
cut and contact out.
Yeah,

2515
01:55:10,041 --> 01:55:10,874
I get that.
Do you still run your company to a 

2516
01:55:13,821 --> 01:55:17,030
degree?
I've got really good people that run it.

2517
01:55:17,031 --> 01:55:19,400
Unfortunately.
My business partner,

2518
01:55:19,640 --> 01:55:20,473
she's an indigenous woman in that area.
She just passed away a couple of weeks 

2519
01:55:22,970 --> 01:55:24,030
ago.
I'm sorry to hear that.

2520
01:55:24,280 --> 01:55:25,580
Yeah.
Which is pretty sad.

2521
01:55:25,581 --> 01:55:26,051
but um,
long.

2522
01:55:26,051 --> 01:55:29,270
Have you known her?
She's uh,

2523
01:55:30,200 --> 01:55:35,200
she's my stepmother so long time.
So that was my dad's partner and um,

2524
01:55:36,590 --> 01:55:40,700
so the indigenous than like,
they don't really live to a long age.

2525
01:55:40,701 --> 01:55:43,980
There's just that they're

2526
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:44,843
sort of,
they're unhealthy in a sense because 

2527
01:55:47,131 --> 01:55:49,860
they're so not used to our process,
you know,

2528
01:55:49,861 --> 01:55:52,520
refined foods and things like that 
because,

2529
01:55:52,590 --> 01:55:53,423
you know,
indigenous.

2530
01:55:53,670 --> 01:55:54,503
How old is dryer?
It's only a couple of hundred years old 

2531
01:55:56,790 --> 01:55:58,800
and um,
so,

2532
01:55:58,980 --> 01:55:59,813
you know,
to get the 60th seems like it's a 

2533
01:56:00,930 --> 01:56:04,500
freaking miracle for them.
So I'm not sure how old she was,

2534
01:56:04,501 --> 01:56:08,760
but she wasn't very old and so 
unfortunately she passed away.

2535
01:56:09,240 --> 01:56:12,630
She was on a dialysis machine and her 
heart was really struggling.

2536
01:56:12,631 --> 01:56:16,800
I ended up giving out,
but I'm sorry,

2537
01:56:16,801 --> 01:56:18,090
where was I?
Where was I going?

2538
01:56:18,630 --> 01:56:19,430
I get it.
Look,

2539
01:56:19,430 --> 01:56:20,800
um,
you know,

2540
01:56:21,160 --> 01:56:22,890
you just,
you were just talking about,

2541
01:56:22,891 --> 01:56:23,724
um,
being off the grid and whether or not 

2542
01:56:25,631 --> 01:56:26,390
you still run your.

2543
01:56:26,390 --> 01:56:27,223
Oh yeah.
So I've got really good people that run 

2544
01:56:28,821 --> 01:56:31,490
the business for me and um,
yeah,

2545
01:56:31,600 --> 01:56:32,433
everything's done by emails and phone 
calls and I hardly do any of that 

2546
01:56:34,491 --> 01:56:35,324
anymore.
I've got my hear from them once a month 

2547
01:56:36,741 --> 01:56:39,680
if need be,
but I'd even look at selling the.

2548
01:56:39,860 --> 01:56:41,540
I'd probably look at selling the 
business,

2549
01:56:41,780 --> 01:56:44,090
especially off of this has happened 
after she's done.

2550
01:56:44,150 --> 01:56:44,983
Yeah.
Yeah.

2551
01:56:45,410 --> 01:56:47,000
Probably look at selling them the 
business,

2552
01:56:47,001 --> 01:56:48,530
but it just depends.
A son,

2553
01:56:50,120 --> 01:56:53,210
her son is going to take over her 
partnership,

2554
01:56:53,330 --> 01:56:54,163
you know,
the joint venture with her and stuff 

2555
01:56:55,041 --> 01:56:55,874
like that,
which will be really good for him and 

2556
01:56:56,691 --> 01:56:59,690
still allow an income into the family 
and things like that.

2557
01:56:59,691 --> 01:57:01,820
So,
so we'll just see where it goes.

2558
01:57:01,821 --> 01:57:02,654
But yeah,
I was really thinking about going off 

2559
01:57:03,351 --> 01:57:06,590
the grid and just like always boys 
wanted to be like that,

2560
01:57:06,850 --> 01:57:08,030
you know,
I just,

2561
01:57:08,590 --> 01:57:09,423
I love that lifestyle.
Time seems to go a lot slow when you're 

2562
01:57:11,961 --> 01:57:16,310
out in the woods facade if you're doing 
exactly what you'd want to do.

2563
01:57:16,311 --> 01:57:16,760
You know,

2564
01:57:16,760 --> 01:57:19,100
I like being in contact with the world 
though.

2565
01:57:19,430 --> 01:57:24,430
I like both.
I do appreciate off the grid times,

2566
01:57:24,471 --> 01:57:26,690
but for me I liked them as like 
vacation,

2567
01:57:27,590 --> 01:57:30,770
but I like being in contact.
I want to know what's happening with the

2568
01:57:30,771 --> 01:57:31,604
world.
I like,

2569
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:36,350
I like being,
I like being aware of cultural change.

2570
01:57:36,580 --> 01:57:39,730
I like being also ricardo because of 
what I do for a living.

2571
01:57:39,830 --> 01:57:40,291
Oh,
for sure.

2572
01:57:40,291 --> 01:57:44,260
yeah.
I sort of don't care for it.

2573
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:48,460
Like we don't watch the news at home,
we don't tune into anything like that.

2574
01:57:48,461 --> 01:57:49,294
Which you sort of leave out life and 
it's like what affects us unless it's 

2575
01:57:53,170 --> 01:57:56,470
affecting the greater community in a 
sense for the worse,

2576
01:57:57,090 --> 01:57:57,923
you know,
because the country is run by fucking 

2577
01:57:59,291 --> 01:58:00,880
clowns.
That's how I feel.

2578
01:58:00,910 --> 01:58:02,070
Your country as well.
Yeah.

2579
01:58:02,930 --> 01:58:03,763
What's worse?
They talked to these folks are too busy 

2580
01:58:06,071 --> 01:58:06,904
trying to look good in parliament and 
argue with each other to get anything 

2581
01:58:09,011 --> 01:58:12,250
actually done.
What are the big issues in Australia?

2582
01:58:12,280 --> 01:58:14,200
I don't know because I don't tune into 
it anymore.

2583
01:58:14,440 --> 01:58:16,450
Well you guys have crazy immigration 
laws.

2584
01:58:16,451 --> 01:58:17,920
Like you don't let anybody go over 
there.

2585
01:58:18,250 --> 01:58:19,083
Like it's like people who think that the
United States is rough with this whole 

2586
01:58:21,401 --> 01:58:22,020
wall.

2587
01:58:22,020 --> 01:58:22,670
Ah,
yeah.

2588
01:58:22,670 --> 01:58:25,160
Australia takes that to a whole new 
level.

2589
01:58:25,161 --> 01:58:28,220
They ship people to an island.
Christmas island.

2590
01:58:28,221 --> 01:58:29,790
It's a fucking nice island.
It.

2591
01:58:29,970 --> 01:58:32,420
Yeah.
Well think about what you guys are.

2592
01:58:32,421 --> 01:58:33,254
I mean you guys replaced the,
the british prisoners to a way better 

2593
01:58:37,131 --> 01:58:38,060
place.
Exactly.

2594
01:58:38,510 --> 01:58:42,370
I did all the security fencing around 
some of the detention

2595
01:58:42,370 --> 01:58:43,960
centers.
So you have to pretty much,

2596
01:58:43,961 --> 01:58:45,730
you're on that island,
you know,

2597
01:58:46,120 --> 01:58:48,880
and then you get shipped to like the 
hardest,

2598
01:58:48,881 --> 01:58:49,714
most fecund arid part of Australia,
like it's deaf and I did the fencing 

2599
01:58:54,041 --> 01:58:54,874
around there and then I believe they,
they fsi long than I can ever get 

2600
01:58:59,020 --> 01:59:02,410
shipped back home where they can go out 
to the broader community in Australia,

2601
01:59:02,411 --> 01:59:04,120
which they get treated very well 
obviously.

2602
01:59:04,420 --> 01:59:05,253
So is it just an assessment place like 
where they trying to find out your 

2603
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:09,820
criminal.
Violent?

2604
01:59:09,880 --> 01:59:11,260
Yeah,
I think that's.

2605
01:59:11,640 --> 01:59:13,290
And that's the important thing,
you know,

2606
01:59:13,291 --> 01:59:15,490
that's why you can't just have open 
borders,

2607
01:59:15,491 --> 01:59:16,780
you know,
some terrorist comes in,

2608
01:59:16,810 --> 01:59:18,910
right?
Some guy that thinks fucking raped,

2609
01:59:18,940 --> 01:59:21,800
fond some guy that thinks you know,
crazy shit,

2610
01:59:21,801 --> 01:59:22,570
fine,
you know,

2611
01:59:22,570 --> 01:59:25,540
assess those people and send them awful.
Yeah.

2612
01:59:25,541 --> 01:59:29,620
But if you did that in the most arid 
part of America,

2613
01:59:29,680 --> 01:59:31,920
people would be so angry because people 
start dyIng.

2614
01:59:32,070 --> 01:59:32,903
People angry in Australia as well.
And I think that has been desks and 

2615
01:59:35,381 --> 01:59:36,880
stuff like that.
What are you supposed to do?

2616
01:59:36,881 --> 01:59:37,920
It's a tech is,
you know,

2617
01:59:37,930 --> 01:59:41,050
it's a very uh,
it's a hard situation.

2618
01:59:41,150 --> 01:59:42,550
It's not something that's just like,
no,

2619
01:59:42,551 --> 01:59:43,390
just let him fruit.
No,

2620
01:59:43,391 --> 01:59:44,770
fuck no.
And it's not like,

2621
01:59:44,771 --> 01:59:47,410
just don't let them through that middle 
ground again,

2622
01:59:47,411 --> 01:59:48,244
you know,
let's them,

2623
01:59:48,460 --> 01:59:51,310
let's work it out because I always 
think,

2624
01:59:51,850 --> 01:59:53,840
what if I was in their shoes,
you know,

2625
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:54,753
I've got kim and the kids or whatever 
and now we're in a country that's war 

2626
01:59:57,230 --> 01:59:58,063
fucking stricken.
I'd be trying to get the fuck out of 

2627
01:59:59,051 --> 02:00:00,970
there too.
No matter what it took,

2628
02:00:01,720 --> 02:00:03,220
you know,
will not,

2629
02:00:03,221 --> 02:00:05,380
no matter what it talked about.
But you know,

2630
02:00:05,440 --> 02:00:07,060
of course,
yeah.

2631
02:00:07,090 --> 02:00:07,923
I mean I always say that about people 
that are talking about people sneaking 

2632
02:00:10,721 --> 02:00:14,170
over this country.
This country is made out of immigrants.

2633
02:00:14,610 --> 02:00:15,443
It's an immigrant country.
What do you expect when you go fucking 

2634
02:00:19,120 --> 02:00:20,260
countries?
Immigrants.

2635
02:00:20,740 --> 02:00:21,573
I mean that is,
that's like people in la saying they 

2636
02:00:23,321 --> 02:00:25,290
don't want anybody moving to la bitch.

2637
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:30,250
Where you from?
We're looking at as dry.

2638
02:00:30,251 --> 02:00:33,850
I like where feel fucking white.
You're an input and by the way,

2639
02:00:34,030 --> 02:00:36,940
if you are one of the original people 
that came here,

2640
02:00:36,941 --> 02:00:39,550
I mean one of the original european 
settlers,

2641
02:00:40,240 --> 02:00:43,690
you probably have fucking slave on your 
grandparents were slave owners.

2642
02:00:43,691 --> 02:00:46,240
Like if,
if you didn't come over here as a recent

2643
02:00:46,241 --> 02:00:47,920
immigrant,
like I'm third generation,

2644
02:00:47,921 --> 02:00:49,630
my grandparents came over here from 
europe.

2645
02:00:50,710 --> 02:00:53,440
If they didn't then if they were here 
for 10,

2646
02:00:53,441 --> 02:00:55,260
15 generations here,
probably fucking.

2647
02:00:56,300 --> 02:00:57,100
Yeah,
exactly.

2648
02:00:57,100 --> 02:00:57,933
So I actually,
I never feel a real good connect with 

2649
02:01:00,461 --> 02:01:04,960
anywhere I go and including my home 
Australia because I'm not indigenous,

2650
02:01:05,470 --> 02:01:06,303
you know,
it's like weird and I've always looked 

2651
02:01:07,361 --> 02:01:08,550
at because,
you know,

2652
02:01:08,560 --> 02:01:11,860
I don't worry about fucking flags or 
borders or anything like that.

2653
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:14,230
I've just always looked at the world the
world has.

2654
02:01:14,380 --> 02:01:15,570
Well,
especially as simple as that.

2655
02:01:15,580 --> 02:01:17,830
SO much time with the indigenous people 
in Australia.

2656
02:01:17,831 --> 02:01:18,190
Yeah.
Yeah.

2657
02:01:18,190 --> 02:01:19,530
Because at work and,
and not,

2658
02:01:19,720 --> 02:01:20,800
you know,
like uh,

2659
02:01:20,801 --> 02:01:21,634
no disrespect to any flag.
I love the flag and I love what they 

2660
02:01:23,471 --> 02:01:24,700
stand for,
but it's not any.

2661
02:01:24,701 --> 02:01:28,930
Someone's these on a board is only 
something that someone's put on the map,

2662
02:01:29,500 --> 02:01:32,590
you know,
it's like of real weird thing like that.

2663
02:01:32,920 --> 02:01:36,670
It is a weird thing,
but also you want to protect people from

2664
02:01:36,671 --> 02:01:39,920
people that come from 100 percent.
It's less.

2665
02:01:39,921 --> 02:01:41,670
The whole world was the same unless 
every,

2666
02:01:41,810 --> 02:01:43,760
the whole world was on the same level.
You know,

2667
02:01:43,761 --> 02:01:45,410
we're not going to do this,
we're not going to do that.

2668
02:01:45,650 --> 02:01:47,730
This is illegal.
This is fine.

2669
02:01:47,731 --> 02:01:50,660
Unless the whole world was like that,
then borders be easy to cross.

2670
02:01:50,690 --> 02:01:51,523
Well,
that's excellent.

2671
02:01:52,550 --> 02:01:55,340
We've been talking about this a lot,
that America is essentially like europe,

2672
02:01:55,580 --> 02:01:56,413
but everybody speaks the same language,
but you can go to any country like New 

2673
02:01:59,630 --> 02:02:01,610
Mexico is fucking way different than 
miami.

2674
02:02:01,830 --> 02:02:04,280
Right?
Miami is way different than la.

2675
02:02:04,340 --> 02:02:05,173
La is way different than seattle.
Those are all almost like completely 

2676
02:02:08,331 --> 02:02:10,610
different place hardly,
but they're all.

2677
02:02:10,640 --> 02:02:11,900
You could go to them.
I mean,

2678
02:02:11,901 --> 02:02:14,270
ideally that's where it would be.
It would be.

2679
02:02:14,271 --> 02:02:16,640
You could travel anywhere where the 
opportunity was.

2680
02:02:16,760 --> 02:02:17,593
We thought you can get a good job and 
you want to better yourself and your 

2681
02:02:19,551 --> 02:02:20,400
family.
YOu,

2682
02:02:20,401 --> 02:02:21,234
you'd have an opportunity.
The fact that currency in life values 

2683
02:02:23,841 --> 02:02:25,130
are different.
For starters,

2684
02:02:25,490 --> 02:02:27,590
he's.
You know why that can't happen?

2685
02:02:28,300 --> 02:02:29,570
yeah,
it'd be nice.

2686
02:02:30,290 --> 02:02:31,123
Be niCe.
It would be nice if one day the whole 

2687
02:02:33,081 --> 02:02:37,010
world rises up and you know,
when you look at the western world,

2688
02:02:37,011 --> 02:02:40,490
whether it's europe or the United States
and places where things are going really

2689
02:02:40,491 --> 02:02:44,360
well or asia,
it would be nice if the whole planet was

2690
02:02:44,361 --> 02:02:47,090
like,
if there was no third world,

2691
02:02:47,420 --> 02:02:48,253
if everything was fantastic,
if everything was just basically just 

2692
02:02:51,651 --> 02:02:53,210
like we're talking about here,
hey,

2693
02:02:53,211 --> 02:02:56,210
you can live in phoenix or you can live 
in billings,

2694
02:02:56,211 --> 02:02:58,910
Montana,
or you could live in Massachusetts.

2695
02:02:59,270 --> 02:03:00,103
go wherever the fuck you want.
That's what we have here and we have a 

2696
02:03:02,121 --> 02:03:05,480
really unique thing in this country and 
that's why people want to come in.

2697
02:03:05,730 --> 02:03:06,780
Yeah,
it's fucking good.

2698
02:03:06,781 --> 02:03:09,080
Is pretty dope.
I hear a lot because you always hear the

2699
02:03:09,081 --> 02:03:12,020
negative things and I hear a lot of 
people were ragging on America and their

2700
02:03:12,021 --> 02:03:13,650
own country and stuff like that.
You know,

2701
02:03:13,680 --> 02:03:16,850
this is fuck these fucking America is 
brilliant.

2702
02:03:17,480 --> 02:03:19,430
Strike is brilliant.
These countries,

2703
02:03:19,431 --> 02:03:22,330
we're also fucking lucky to be here,
you know,

2704
02:03:22,650 --> 02:03:24,560
because you look it up a positive world 
and you're like,

2705
02:03:24,590 --> 02:03:27,680
fuck,
I can't feed their baby because you know

2706
02:03:27,681 --> 02:03:28,670
what I mean?
Like,

2707
02:03:28,770 --> 02:03:29,720
yeah,
yeah.

2708
02:03:30,140 --> 02:03:30,973
I think africa,
like always frightened my kids and it's 

2709
02:03:32,961 --> 02:03:33,794
not a free because I love it,
but I always say I'm fucking taking to 

2710
02:03:36,090 --> 02:03:40,730
africa because a,
have a long ago when I went to africa,

2711
02:03:41,230 --> 02:03:42,063
like I was watching little babies in a 
village crawl around in like free four 

2712
02:03:44,681 --> 02:03:45,680
inch,
the dust,

2713
02:03:46,200 --> 02:03:47,033
you know,
every second person you met had fucking 

2714
02:03:48,351 --> 02:03:50,030
war scars on their face,
you know,

2715
02:03:50,031 --> 02:03:53,010
and mozambicans,
zimbabweans and uh,

2716
02:03:53,270 --> 02:03:54,910
you're driving down,
there's a roadblock.

2717
02:03:54,920 --> 02:03:58,610
There's dudes with fucking ak 47.
Is that a duck type together?

2718
02:03:59,000 --> 02:03:59,833
There's a guy on the side of the road 
with a fucking bazooka or rocket 

2719
02:04:01,641 --> 02:04:04,070
launcher or you don't know if they 
friend or foe,

2720
02:04:04,460 --> 02:04:05,293
you know?
And this is just not a normal everyday 

2721
02:04:07,041 --> 02:04:09,770
life going for africa.
There's a tourist bus on the side of the

2722
02:04:09,771 --> 02:04:10,604
road.
It's fucking burn out and it's just 

2723
02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:15,770
bullet hole sprite for a line of the 
windows,

2724
02:04:15,771 --> 02:04:16,910
you know?
And shit like that.

2725
02:04:16,911 --> 02:04:19,640
And it's like fuck,
this isn't Australia,

2726
02:04:19,670 --> 02:04:22,130
this isn't America,
this is different.

2727
02:04:22,131 --> 02:04:22,964
And,
and sometimes in my kids they're 

2728
02:04:25,130 --> 02:04:29,270
grateful but they are on a different 
tune than me and I'm just like fuck,

2729
02:04:29,271 --> 02:04:31,580
they need a trip to africa and I can 
see,

2730
02:04:31,610 --> 02:04:35,480
not that I'm trying to expose someone 
else's life so my kids realize like,

2731
02:04:35,890 --> 02:04:37,740
but just so they can feel,
you know,

2732
02:04:37,770 --> 02:04:40,170
like you've got a good,
you know,

2733
02:04:40,171 --> 02:04:42,150
you've got a good life,
you're like appreciate.

2734
02:04:42,370 --> 02:04:45,540
It can be a lot harder.
It's hard to appreciate,

2735
02:04:45,541 --> 02:04:46,374
right.
It's like we were talking about going 

2736
02:04:47,221 --> 02:04:50,730
into the bush and if you go into the 
bush for seven days then you come out,

2737
02:04:50,731 --> 02:04:51,564
you appreciate hot water.
He appreciates sunshine if you'd been 

2738
02:04:53,941 --> 02:04:54,774
out in the rain.
But it's hard for people to appreciate 

2739
02:04:58,201 --> 02:05:01,980
it without actually experiencing it 
because you can only conceptualize it so

2740
02:05:01,981 --> 02:05:05,250
much in your head unless you're actually
there.

2741
02:05:05,280 --> 02:05:06,990
It's,
it doesn't do it,

2742
02:05:07,770 --> 02:05:08,603
does it.
And that's virtually reality is never 

2743
02:05:10,591 --> 02:05:11,940
going to touch on that ab,
huh?

2744
02:05:12,110 --> 02:05:13,510
No,
no.

2745
02:05:13,530 --> 02:05:14,363
It's going to turn us into this some 
weird spongy looking fucking soft jelly 

2746
02:05:19,201 --> 02:05:20,960
bag.
Exactly,

2747
02:05:20,961 --> 02:05:21,794
yeah,
I'm worried.

2748
02:05:22,080 --> 02:05:26,460
I'm really worried about the future,
but I guess that's just what happens.

2749
02:05:26,550 --> 02:05:27,840
I mean,
cause it seems like,

2750
02:05:28,830 --> 02:05:29,663
look,
we'll mild nana and pa would have been 

2751
02:05:31,081 --> 02:05:33,930
saying the same thing about our 
generation now.

2752
02:05:33,990 --> 02:05:38,990
Well we are soft as fuck in comparison 
to chimps are ancient.

2753
02:05:39,211 --> 02:05:40,044
Ancient ancestors were something like 
chimps and they're probably looking at 

2754
02:05:43,891 --> 02:05:45,210
us now.
It'd be like,

2755
02:05:45,211 --> 02:05:48,310
look at these pussies with their shoes.
They need houses.

2756
02:05:48,480 --> 02:05:50,610
You can't even sleep at a tree fucking 
dummies.

2757
02:05:51,030 --> 02:05:52,500
You know what I mean?
Like they totally.

2758
02:05:52,530 --> 02:05:54,290
But we don't want to live like that 
either.

2759
02:05:54,380 --> 02:05:56,310
It'll,
maybe the matrix will be so beautiful.

2760
02:05:56,311 --> 02:05:58,920
But as adam greentree running around 
with a fucking gun,

2761
02:05:58,921 --> 02:06:00,480
that doesn't work,
stick it in the facebook.

2762
02:06:00,550 --> 02:06:01,950
That's fucking funny.
I,

2763
02:06:01,951 --> 02:06:04,590
um,
if I'm hunting and it's raining,

2764
02:06:04,591 --> 02:06:05,424
I always what gets me out there and 
continues me to hunting their guy and 

2765
02:06:07,830 --> 02:06:09,480
he's on like,
it's fucking water.

2766
02:06:09,810 --> 02:06:11,760
Like I have a shower every night when 
I'm at home,

2767
02:06:11,761 --> 02:06:14,010
I get the dry off afterwards.
But I'm like,

2768
02:06:14,070 --> 02:06:15,570
have you ever seen animals in the rain?

2769
02:06:15,570 --> 02:06:20,100
Like an animal will be like fading and 
it sunshine just fading and it will stop

2770
02:06:20,101 --> 02:06:21,960
pissing down raining.
It just keeps feeding.

2771
02:06:22,380 --> 02:06:23,790
It doesn't even fuCking like,
well,

2772
02:06:23,850 --> 02:06:26,060
it doesn't just deal.
it's just fucking life.

2773
02:06:26,070 --> 02:06:26,910
You know,
it's life.

2774
02:06:26,960 --> 02:06:30,060
And I always think I'm just an animal.
Like what's the difference?

2775
02:06:30,061 --> 02:06:32,910
I'll get hypothermia and die.
Well gortex,

2776
02:06:34,360 --> 02:06:36,170
she gets some audio record,
textbook,

2777
02:06:36,950 --> 02:06:38,230
you're fine.
then it's like,

2778
02:06:38,580 --> 02:06:40,680
but even if you don't,
it's like fuck,

2779
02:06:40,681 --> 02:06:41,514
whatever.
You just,

2780
02:06:41,640 --> 02:06:43,960
it's just water.
The technology today,

2781
02:06:43,961 --> 02:06:46,200
like what they figured out for outdoor 
gear.

2782
02:06:46,201 --> 02:06:47,160
So good.
You were,

2783
02:06:47,161 --> 02:06:48,660
you know,
merino wool,

2784
02:06:48,960 --> 02:06:52,110
which even when it gets wet,
keeps your body warmth in this.

2785
02:06:52,120 --> 02:06:55,590
The water protection.
This gear so good.

2786
02:06:55,591 --> 02:06:58,080
There's so many different companies that
make outstanding stuff now.

2787
02:06:58,410 --> 02:07:00,120
You can be fine in the rain.
Exactly.

2788
02:07:00,121 --> 02:07:00,954
Yeah.
Yeah.

2789
02:07:01,320 --> 02:07:02,153
And yeah,
I just think that we just keep it and 

2790
02:07:03,580 --> 02:07:04,080
sorry,
moved.

2791
02:07:04,080 --> 02:07:06,990
Like as soon as it rains,
like everyone runs to the car runs here.

2792
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:08,940
So here they don't even know how to 
drive.

2793
02:07:08,980 --> 02:07:09,813
Yeah.
Oh fuck.

2794
02:07:10,680 --> 02:07:12,320
Oh my god.
A little bit of drizzle it,

2795
02:07:12,330 --> 02:07:13,370
but it'S like,
ah.

2796
02:07:13,560 --> 02:07:16,080
And the accidents everywhere.
People don't,

2797
02:07:16,140 --> 02:07:18,810
don't realize it gets slippery.
You dumb fucks.

2798
02:07:18,860 --> 02:07:23,010
Change of driving.
Fucking ali has been.

2799
02:07:23,011 --> 02:07:25,920
It's so goofy.
It's nearly upsetting because I'm like,

2800
02:07:25,921 --> 02:07:28,020
people have to do this everyday to go to
work.

2801
02:07:28,110 --> 02:07:29,070
Oh,
traffic.

2802
02:07:29,071 --> 02:07:31,170
Some people's lives.
I'm like,

2803
02:07:31,171 --> 02:07:35,160
what the why the fuck would you do that?
Like people

2804
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:37,930
they fucking caught up in the whole 
system.

2805
02:07:38,050 --> 02:07:43,050
If you drive out to like a,
like you go up the five and head towards

2806
02:07:44,040 --> 02:07:44,873
palm dale or bakersfield or any place 
out there and you see traffic at like 

2807
02:07:49,750 --> 02:07:54,750
6:00 in the morning bumper to bumper.
all people making it to la so they drive

2808
02:07:56,951 --> 02:07:59,090
an hour all the way out to palmdale 
hour,

2809
02:07:59,110 --> 02:07:59,943
15 hour 20 because the rent is cheaper 
and then they make their way or a home 

2810
02:08:03,790 --> 02:08:07,280
that their law,
their life everyday.

2811
02:08:07,510 --> 02:08:11,260
Three hours plus of driving in the car,
orange county,

2812
02:08:11,280 --> 02:08:15,130
the people that live in orange county,
that place is fucking dense.

2813
02:08:15,800 --> 02:08:17,380
Dense.
It's beautiful out there.

2814
02:08:17,381 --> 02:08:18,820
It's great.
Great place to live,

2815
02:08:18,821 --> 02:08:21,460
but god damn.
If you have to go anywhere,

2816
02:08:21,490 --> 02:08:23,290
like if you have to drive to hollywood 
everyday,

2817
02:08:23,320 --> 02:08:24,153
good fucking luck keeping your sanity 
that there's probably a car right now 

2818
02:08:27,761 --> 02:08:28,594
listening to us.
Is this five reopens in the grapevine 

2819
02:08:33,520 --> 02:08:34,480
after.
What is it?

2820
02:08:34,481 --> 02:08:36,460
Snow.
Last month when it first snowed,

2821
02:08:36,461 --> 02:08:40,060
like this is what you're saying,
like palmdale area.

2822
02:08:40,120 --> 02:08:41,590
This is,
it was snowing in palmdale.

2823
02:08:41,591 --> 02:08:42,940
Just shut everything down.

2824
02:08:45,630 --> 02:08:46,930
I got stuck.
That's the thing.

2825
02:08:46,950 --> 02:08:51,430
If someone's got a goal in there,
I'm in towards that and doing the job to

2826
02:08:51,431 --> 02:08:54,760
get that goal than fucking good on them.
But other than that,

2827
02:08:54,761 --> 02:08:55,594
if you're doing thiS for a fucking dead 
end job vehicles just sitting on the 

2828
02:08:58,961 --> 02:09:01,090
highway covered in snow.
Yeah.

2829
02:09:01,091 --> 02:09:01,924
That's where you want a four wheel drive
truck with some good fucking knobby 

2830
02:09:05,531 --> 02:09:06,460
tires.
No,

2831
02:09:06,490 --> 02:09:09,460
that's when you ring up and sound not 
coming.

2832
02:09:10,600 --> 02:09:11,433
Yeah.
That too.

2833
02:09:11,840 --> 02:09:13,960
Yeah.
I feel sorry.

2834
02:09:13,961 --> 02:09:15,840
Sorry for anyone that's caught out with 
that.

2835
02:09:16,060 --> 02:09:17,730
So rare.
This is out there too.

2836
02:09:17,750 --> 02:09:19,900
No one knows what the fuck to do when it
snows.

2837
02:09:20,350 --> 02:09:23,910
I grew up in Boston and in the snow.
Uh,

2838
02:09:24,110 --> 02:09:27,550
I had to drive every day in the snow 
because I delivered newspapers.

2839
02:09:27,580 --> 02:09:32,580
that was my job from time I was like 17 
till I was 22 ish,

2840
02:09:33,791 --> 02:09:34,600
somewhere around there.

2841
02:09:34,600 --> 02:09:36,820
Maybe the last time I stopped 22,
23.

2842
02:09:37,240 --> 02:09:41,320
I got up every fucking morning.
So it taught me two things.

2843
02:09:41,321 --> 02:09:43,330
One,
it taught me discipline because I had to

2844
02:09:43,331 --> 02:09:45,160
be up at 5:00 in the morning no matter 
what,

2845
02:09:45,250 --> 02:09:48,590
even earlier on sundaY because it was a 
big fix.

2846
02:09:48,591 --> 02:09:50,650
Sunday papers,
you have to make multiple trips.

2847
02:09:51,460 --> 02:09:52,293
I Even had a van that I bought a cargo 
van just to deliver newspapers in some 

2848
02:09:55,301 --> 02:09:58,030
shitty cargo van.
I forgot to change the oil and

2849
02:09:59,870 --> 02:10:01,680
brought it to the guy and I go what's 
wrong?

2850
02:10:01,681 --> 02:10:02,770
And he's like,
you didn't have any oil.

2851
02:10:02,771 --> 02:10:03,640
And I'm like,
fuck,

2852
02:10:04,400 --> 02:10:05,830
I'm not good with cars.

2853
02:10:08,120 --> 02:10:10,690
But I drove in the snow every day,
man.

2854
02:10:10,930 --> 02:10:12,730
So if I'm in the snow today,
I'm like,

2855
02:10:12,970 --> 02:10:14,740
I feel my ass and kick out.
I'm like,

2856
02:10:14,741 --> 02:10:15,700
whoa,
hey,

2857
02:10:15,701 --> 02:10:17,530
I know what to do here.
You don't panic.

2858
02:10:17,531 --> 02:10:21,850
I don't slam on the brakes.
Like I drove a lot in snow.

2859
02:10:21,910 --> 02:10:25,660
Did you remember having like a set goal 
at that Point doing that job?

2860
02:10:25,750 --> 02:10:26,583
No,
I just wanted to not work and nobody 

2861
02:10:29,081 --> 02:10:31,090
could tell them what to do when I was in
my car because I like.

2862
02:10:31,180 --> 02:10:33,860
the thing about it is I had a job,
this was my task.

2863
02:10:33,861 --> 02:10:36,940
I had hundreds of houses that I 
delivered newspapers too,

2864
02:10:37,520 --> 02:10:40,400
but I didn't have anybody with me while 
I was doing it.

2865
02:10:40,680 --> 02:10:41,513
So while doing it,
nobody's telling me what to do and 

2866
02:10:42,901 --> 02:10:46,190
nobody's yelling at me.
I'd listened to the radio,

2867
02:10:46,191 --> 02:10:49,880
listen to talk radio and just listen to 
music,

2868
02:10:50,030 --> 02:10:53,780
think about jokes and shit and just 
throw newspapers out the window.

2869
02:10:54,410 --> 02:10:57,680
It was nice.
It is nice to not have someone that.

2870
02:10:57,740 --> 02:10:58,573
It was better for me.
I would waY rather work seven days a 

2871
02:11:00,561 --> 02:11:03,260
week and it was only a few days,
a few hours a day.

2872
02:11:03,410 --> 02:11:08,410
So even though it was everY single day,
it was only like three hours a day,

2873
02:11:09,710 --> 02:11:10,543
you know,
I was done by eight and I'd go back to 

2874
02:11:12,081 --> 02:11:12,530
sleep.

2875
02:11:12,530 --> 02:11:14,330
Yeah,
you've goT the biggest fucking podcast.

2876
02:11:15,010 --> 02:11:15,843
it's crazy.
I saw I've being self employed since I 

2877
02:11:18,051 --> 02:11:19,820
was 21.
Yeah.

2878
02:11:19,821 --> 02:11:20,654
Yeah.
And I had a big media company reached 

2879
02:11:22,151 --> 02:11:27,050
out to me not so long ago and the 
biggest thing that turned me off because

2880
02:11:27,080 --> 02:11:27,913
the pricing and everything was right was
unlike a fucking contact orders or what 

2881
02:11:32,111 --> 02:11:35,630
they want you to take orders,
a podcast types.

2882
02:11:35,880 --> 02:11:37,130
Yeah.
Pretty much.

2883
02:11:37,540 --> 02:11:38,373
I mean a lot of my content and 
unfortunately a part of that would have 

2884
02:11:42,261 --> 02:11:43,094
been changing some of the companies that
I'm with and like I'm friends with the 

2885
02:11:46,710 --> 02:11:47,543
companies with those companies because 
they're what I want to be like hunting 

2886
02:11:50,540 --> 02:11:51,310
companies.
Yeah.

2887
02:11:51,310 --> 02:11:53,300
Yeah.
And uh,

2888
02:11:53,510 --> 02:11:56,780
but the thought of happened to be on 
someone else's timeline.

2889
02:11:56,781 --> 02:11:59,690
Then like I was like,
I fucking don't want to do that.

2890
02:11:59,780 --> 02:12:00,613
I can,
like right now I'm just doing me and 

2891
02:12:02,630 --> 02:12:05,180
whatever happens happens.
And it's like your situation,

2892
02:12:05,181 --> 02:12:05,880
you know?

2893
02:12:05,880 --> 02:12:06,713
Yeah.
If I even had a guy that I had to check 

2894
02:12:07,951 --> 02:12:10,410
in with once a month and say,
so,

2895
02:12:10,411 --> 02:12:11,790
uh,
everything looks good.

2896
02:12:11,791 --> 02:12:13,350
We got an upward trend here.
I'd be like,

2897
02:12:14,300 --> 02:12:16,740
I would fucking phone call again.

2898
02:12:17,410 --> 02:12:18,243
Yeah.
And I'm such a spur of the moment guy 

2899
02:12:21,380 --> 02:12:25,150
this hunt come up on going there but 
want to do this with the kids or kid the

2900
02:12:25,151 --> 02:12:27,640
family onto calendar and doing it.
I really liked that.

2901
02:12:27,670 --> 02:12:28,503
So relaxing dude to be like that and 
that's why I built the business that 

2902
02:12:31,271 --> 02:12:35,110
I've got to where it is as well where I 
don't have to be at work continually.

2903
02:12:35,620 --> 02:12:37,150
How often are you putting out your 
podcast?

2904
02:12:37,840 --> 02:12:38,673
RIght now?
I've put a hold on it since this trip 

2905
02:12:40,930 --> 02:12:41,763
because it's just been so.
Even though this trip would have been 

2906
02:12:43,721 --> 02:12:44,554
epic to do it on,
I guess I just haven't done it because 

2907
02:12:47,320 --> 02:12:50,470
everything's like so fast forward.
It's insane.

2908
02:12:50,500 --> 02:12:51,333
Plus you have the kids with you that's 
hours a day that you just don't know 

2909
02:12:53,931 --> 02:12:56,740
exactly yet,
but as soon as I get back home,

2910
02:12:56,741 --> 02:13:00,010
which is like a middle of february after
the western expo,

2911
02:13:00,011 --> 02:13:01,540
then I'm going to start pumping it 
again.

2912
02:13:01,630 --> 02:13:05,140
I love doing.
I love doing that.

2913
02:13:05,170 --> 02:13:06,003
When does that start?
RIght?

2914
02:13:06,490 --> 02:13:10,850
I think it's like 15th 16th.
17th of february movie.

2915
02:13:11,060 --> 02:13:15,580
Really?
You should get along.

2916
02:13:15,750 --> 02:13:16,583
I've been there before the February 14th
to the 17th western expo in salt lake 

2917
02:13:21,971 --> 02:13:22,804
city,
Utah,

2918
02:13:23,820 --> 02:13:26,650
but daddy's not pre.
On the 14th is valentine's day.

2919
02:13:26,920 --> 02:13:30,720
You got to pick your battles,
pick your battles,

2920
02:13:30,990 --> 02:13:31,920
pick your battles.

2921
02:13:32,580 --> 02:13:33,413
You got to know what to do.
Like I make sure that I take plenty of 

2922
02:13:35,671 --> 02:13:38,330
family vacations around hunting trips.
Yeah,

2923
02:13:38,460 --> 02:13:40,650
totally.
So we just went over to the big island,

2924
02:13:40,651 --> 02:13:42,660
didn't you know,
we went to maui.

2925
02:13:42,890 --> 02:13:44,880
Oh,
we did that for new years.

2926
02:13:44,940 --> 02:13:45,773
Yeah.
Yeah.

2927
02:13:45,870 --> 02:13:48,110
I decided to stop working on new years.
Yeah,

2928
02:13:48,230 --> 02:13:50,970
because right now I can't really work 
anyway,

2929
02:13:51,060 --> 02:13:51,893
like legitimately for a couple months 
because I don't have enough material 

2930
02:13:54,931 --> 02:13:59,280
because I just did a netflix special and
I want to make sure I don't want anybody

2931
02:13:59,281 --> 02:14:03,510
coming to see me and I'm half ass.
So if I'm doiNg sets around la,

2932
02:14:03,511 --> 02:14:06,180
like right now I could rock it for 20 
minutes or half hour.

2933
02:14:06,181 --> 02:14:08,340
That's easy.
I mean that's not easy,

2934
02:14:08,341 --> 02:14:11,010
but it's doable.
It's legit.

2935
02:14:11,011 --> 02:14:13,710
I don't feel like I'm a fraud.
Like if I do a half hour show,

2936
02:14:13,711 --> 02:14:15,770
that's a real half hour show,
but it's not a real.

2937
02:14:15,780 --> 02:14:19,920
Our show is a big deal because our show,
like in a theater or an arena,

2938
02:14:20,130 --> 02:14:20,963
I really need an hour and 20 [inaudible]
I know you gotta make sure everything's 

2939
02:14:24,451 --> 02:14:25,284
good.
It's just there's a giant 

2940
02:14:27,661 --> 02:14:29,970
responsibility.
You don't want to leave anybody.

2941
02:14:30,180 --> 02:14:33,510
People get babysitters and they take 
time out of the day.

2942
02:14:33,511 --> 02:14:35,880
I got to be prepared so I work hard at 
it.

2943
02:14:36,120 --> 02:14:36,953
So I was thinking about new years and 
when it came they were trying to set up 

2944
02:14:39,961 --> 02:14:43,260
new year's gigs for me and I'm like,
not only am I not ready,

2945
02:14:43,261 --> 02:14:46,530
I don't think I want to do it because it
seems like such a big event.

2946
02:14:46,620 --> 02:14:47,840
Totally.
New year's is

2947
02:14:48,410 --> 02:14:51,730
snow.
Why can't believe it?

2948
02:14:51,740 --> 02:14:54,920
We're celebrating.
It's like vegas on crack,

2949
02:14:55,090 --> 02:14:55,923
you know?
It's like the whole thing has just 

2950
02:14:56,751 --> 02:14:59,870
ramped up so far.
Past normal

2951
02:15:01,020 --> 02:15:02,400
show show,
I would say,

2952
02:15:02,401 --> 02:15:04,470
well we're out in the desert.
We should make human.

2953
02:15:04,480 --> 02:15:07,950
The kIds on new year's and to everything
else.

2954
02:15:07,960 --> 02:15:09,730
Yes.
Fucking tons like normal.

2955
02:15:09,790 --> 02:15:10,623
But that the human rights,
it's like because it's written on a 

2956
02:15:12,761 --> 02:15:14,320
calendar,
it's like these big deal,

2957
02:15:14,321 --> 02:15:15,970
you know,
and it is cool,

2958
02:15:15,971 --> 02:15:16,804
but fuck,
it seems like such a good time just to 

2959
02:15:18,881 --> 02:15:19,640
chill with me.

2960
02:15:19,640 --> 02:15:21,530
Yeah,
It was a good time to chill.

2961
02:15:21,531 --> 02:15:22,800
Yeah.
We went to the,

2962
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:23,713
you know,
we were staying at a resort in maui and 

2963
02:15:26,580 --> 02:15:29,300
was beautiful and the food was great and
it was picked up.

2964
02:15:29,301 --> 02:15:32,840
Beach was great.
Just chill.

2965
02:15:33,260 --> 02:15:35,870
I need more of that in my life.
I need more chill time,

2966
02:15:35,900 --> 02:15:38,390
just everything.
I'm just doing so many different things.

2967
02:15:38,770 --> 02:15:41,560
I have to balance it out with nothing.
Sometimes

2968
02:15:41,920 --> 02:15:44,010
there is because when I'm go,
go,

2969
02:15:44,011 --> 02:15:45,330
go.
Sometimes I'm just like,

2970
02:15:45,360 --> 02:15:46,193
fuck,
I just want to sit on the couch and I 

2971
02:15:47,461 --> 02:15:50,010
feel lazy as fuck when I do it because 
I'm so used to going.

2972
02:15:50,400 --> 02:15:53,440
But thAt sitting on the couch and 
watching a movie and just chill and it's

2973
02:15:53,441 --> 02:15:55,500
like you recharged.
Holy shit.

2974
02:15:55,501 --> 02:15:56,334
Damn you recharge.
It totally isn't a makes you hungry to 

2975
02:15:58,801 --> 02:15:59,191
go,
go,

2976
02:15:59,191 --> 02:16:00,310
go again.
You know,

2977
02:16:00,570 --> 02:16:01,620
sometimes I need that.

2978
02:16:02,010 --> 02:16:02,843
I need that for.
That took me awhile to figure that out 

2979
02:16:04,591 --> 02:16:05,424
with stand up to.
so like sometimes I need to take little 

2980
02:16:07,111 --> 02:16:12,030
breaks just to recharge my imagination,
recharged my enthusiasm for it.

2981
02:16:12,390 --> 02:16:15,240
There's a balance in life.
Like you can't work out five hours a day

2982
02:16:15,241 --> 02:16:18,510
every day you break your body.
Totally need breaks and I think you need

2983
02:16:18,511 --> 02:16:21,330
breaks with your imagination.
You need breaks with enthusiasm,

2984
02:16:21,331 --> 02:16:22,164
with everything.
Yeah.

2985
02:16:22,290 --> 02:16:24,130
let them on reset.
Yeah.

2986
02:16:24,550 --> 02:16:25,383
So,
so what are you doing while you were in 

2987
02:16:27,121 --> 02:16:28,590
la?
Like how long are you going to be here?

2988
02:16:28,860 --> 02:16:30,000
Uh,
so we

2989
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:31,990
did disney with the kids and just 
chilled out.

2990
02:16:31,991 --> 02:16:34,420
We're leaving tomorrow hidden back to 
Utah,

2991
02:16:34,421 --> 02:16:39,100
salt lake city and do up there.
Pretty much getting organized to go back

2992
02:16:39,101 --> 02:16:39,934
home.
So I'm going to drop the winnebago 

2993
02:16:42,221 --> 02:16:43,054
trailer.
I'm going to drop off there and 

2994
02:16:44,930 --> 02:16:45,611
declutter.
Yeah.

2995
02:16:45,611 --> 02:16:46,980
I'm going to go visit hoyt.
Yeah.

2996
02:16:47,590 --> 02:16:50,410
I'm going to send out a bunch of this 
shit that I said I'd give away and stuff

2997
02:16:50,411 --> 02:16:53,160
like that.
Then we're going back to Utah.

2998
02:16:53,350 --> 02:16:55,510
Utah's been our base pretty much.
Some friends are up,

2999
02:16:55,540 --> 02:16:56,373
Utah going to go back to Utah and pack 
up a bunch of stuff and then I'll get a 

3000
02:16:59,861 --> 02:17:00,694
bison hunt that I'm going to do.
That's the last hunt while I'm in 

3001
02:17:02,711 --> 02:17:05,230
America.
And then down to the western expo,

3002
02:17:05,231 --> 02:17:06,064
we've got a,
like a white screen and one of the 

3003
02:17:08,111 --> 02:17:08,944
movies that I did there,
I did a movie over in New Zealand and 

3004
02:17:11,951 --> 02:17:12,784
uh,
the boys from a bow hunt down under in 

3005
02:17:14,051 --> 02:17:14,884
Australia,
filmed it for me and they did a fucking 

3006
02:17:16,780 --> 02:17:17,820
awesome job.
well,

3007
02:17:17,821 --> 02:17:21,810
the one you guys did with cam,
the under armour one was fantastic.

3008
02:17:21,890 --> 02:17:23,370
It was really good.
That was good.

3009
02:17:23,430 --> 02:17:25,450
They did a great job with.
They're fun

3010
02:17:25,630 --> 02:17:28,690
do than what the fucking movie is 
because you know,

3011
02:17:28,810 --> 02:17:30,670
they want to cut it,
cut it down to 20 minutes.

3012
02:17:30,671 --> 02:17:32,860
I made that one pretty long where it was
20 something minutes.

3013
02:17:33,310 --> 02:17:34,143
But um,
because main cam I'd like two weeks 

3014
02:17:35,390 --> 02:17:36,223
together.
Fucking running around going was 

3015
02:17:37,721 --> 02:17:41,170
awesome.
And there's so much that they can't show

3016
02:17:41,260 --> 02:17:42,610
in that 20 minutes.
Of course,

3017
02:17:42,611 --> 02:17:44,230
you know,
and like some really cool shit.

3018
02:17:45,670 --> 02:17:47,710
I'm hoping to get cameron out again this
year.

3019
02:17:47,800 --> 02:17:52,390
I've got those two buffalo hunts lined 
up and you need to come out to,

3020
02:17:52,391 --> 02:17:52,990
which would be fun

3021
02:17:52,990 --> 02:17:55,460
and wholesome.
You're already fucking criteo.

3022
02:17:55,530 --> 02:17:58,420
What else can I do?
I had it all fucking planned.

3023
02:17:59,370 --> 02:18:01,310
This whole.
The city of this whole trip.

3024
02:18:01,311 --> 02:18:02,020
I bet.
No,

3025
02:18:02,020 --> 02:18:04,070
no.
What I've been doing in America,

3026
02:18:04,490 --> 02:18:05,323
I've been collecting fucking spiders and
snakes and shit like that and I was 

3027
02:18:08,691 --> 02:18:10,740
gonna let them all fucking go in the 
studio,

3028
02:18:10,750 --> 02:18:11,583
dude.
I was going to let them all go in the 

3029
02:18:13,371 --> 02:18:14,120
studio.
I'm like,

3030
02:18:14,120 --> 02:18:16,060
fuck.
He will never have me on again if I knew

3031
02:18:16,070 --> 02:18:16,903
that,
but I was going to bring one in here 

3032
02:18:18,291 --> 02:18:20,630
with me to just show me just fucking 
now.

3033
02:18:20,631 --> 02:18:21,464
I was just going to let it out halfway 
through them and see if you could carry 

3034
02:18:23,931 --> 02:18:28,931
on.
I had an old fucking lined up and then I

3035
02:18:29,871 --> 02:18:32,000
got changed because I had to go to 
Arizona.

3036
02:18:32,001 --> 02:18:34,860
I didn't get to go back to Idaho.
We're all fucking creepy.

3037
02:18:35,660 --> 02:18:37,870
let them all go.
Did you go to Idaho?

3038
02:18:37,880 --> 02:18:41,090
It all this trump hates.
It was fucking amazing.

3039
02:18:41,091 --> 02:18:44,810
That's Idaho.
Might be like the undiscovered gem,

3040
02:18:45,090 --> 02:18:48,140
like
in this country,

3041
02:18:48,141 --> 02:18:53,030
there's fucking no one there to.
Boise is fantastic.

3042
02:18:53,031 --> 02:18:56,450
I fucking love that city.
I had a great time there man.

3043
02:18:56,451 --> 02:18:58,600
It's beautiful in the mountains out 
there.

3044
02:18:58,610 --> 02:18:59,930
So good is,
it's

3045
02:18:59,930 --> 02:19:01,860
a pretty place.
So our friends a bicycling,

3046
02:19:02,090 --> 02:19:02,923
so every time we fly in every year when 
we fly and I usually fly in the Idaho 

3047
02:19:05,751 --> 02:19:08,990
first right up high near spokane,
like near Washington.

3048
02:19:09,740 --> 02:19:14,060
And then we ended up driving from there 
to southern Colorado,

3049
02:19:14,120 --> 02:19:15,950
southern Colorado,
New Mexico,

3050
02:19:16,730 --> 02:19:17,563
New Mexico back to southern Colorado.
[inaudible] came out of promo and tags 

3051
02:19:20,360 --> 02:19:21,193
dealing.
She ended up tagging a promo and then 

3052
02:19:23,900 --> 02:19:25,750
this is how my sheet I'll fucking done 
on this trip.

3053
02:19:25,770 --> 02:19:27,980
I can't,
I had to get in the fucking write it

3054
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:29,960
down because I'm like,
where have we been?

3055
02:19:29,990 --> 02:19:30,823
It's been hectic and um,
I think I'll be in Idaho like four or 

3056
02:19:35,151 --> 02:19:37,280
five times in this trip,
like back and forth,

3057
02:19:37,310 --> 02:19:39,920
back and forth.
Did you ever go to quarter lane?

3058
02:19:40,130 --> 02:19:40,761
Yep.
Yeah.

3059
02:19:40,761 --> 02:19:42,620
I haven't had my friends in the accord 
line.

3060
02:19:42,621 --> 02:19:45,530
It's beautiful.
It's so clear.

3061
02:19:45,710 --> 02:19:47,660
You could see like a hundred feet down 
the bottom.

3062
02:19:47,690 --> 02:19:48,523
It's a fucking nice spot.
I've got to bring up this message and 

3063
02:19:50,750 --> 02:19:54,660
read it out.
It's.

3064
02:19:54,740 --> 02:19:56,030
Yeah,
it's been crazy.

3065
02:19:56,550 --> 02:19:57,530
Yeah,
so we ended up.

3066
02:19:57,590 --> 02:19:58,423
We flew in the Idaho and we went to 
southern Colorado and we went to New 

3067
02:20:02,180 --> 02:20:04,520
Mexico back to southern Colorado,
backup the Idaho,

3068
02:20:05,510 --> 02:20:06,343
and then I ended up flying out.
Now we ended up driving the eastern 

3069
02:20:09,531 --> 02:20:11,360
Oregon,
the hump bull elk.

3070
02:20:12,050 --> 02:20:12,883
Then I ended up flying out to Arizona to
hunt elk as well on the navajo 

3071
02:20:17,420 --> 02:20:18,980
reservation,
which was really cool.

3072
02:20:19,880 --> 02:20:24,880
Then we.
Then I flew to bc hunted moose,

3073
02:20:25,280 --> 02:20:27,950
then I flew back,
then we went to Kentucky.

3074
02:20:28,400 --> 02:20:30,830
I drive all the way to Kentucky with the
kids,

3075
02:20:31,040 --> 02:20:34,700
which took like four or five days.
I was fucking insane.

3076
02:20:34,701 --> 02:20:36,410
We took it out on sort of checking it 
out,

3077
02:20:36,740 --> 02:20:37,880
you know,
where there's nothIng.

3078
02:20:38,510 --> 02:20:43,510
There's absolutely nothing.
Nebraska dude hall leaf.

3079
02:20:45,560 --> 02:20:46,393
We drove for hours and hours for 
Nebraska and like saying nothing but 

3080
02:20:50,360 --> 02:20:53,810
luck cornfield or something like that.
sorry,

3081
02:20:53,811 --> 02:20:54,644
anyone from Nebraska,
but Nebraska was born in Nebraska right 

3082
02:20:57,081 --> 02:20:58,400
now.
Oh my gosh.

3083
02:21:00,050 --> 02:21:02,540
I'm sure there's some pretty places.
I don't think so.

3084
02:21:02,780 --> 02:21:04,130
They know about it.
Yeah,

3085
02:21:04,131 --> 02:21:04,964
that's right.
Yeah,

3086
02:21:04,970 --> 02:21:05,660
it wasn't.
That was it.

3087
02:21:05,660 --> 02:21:08,240
oh,
Kansas was dorothy wizard of oz.

3088
02:21:09,010 --> 02:21:12,080
We went to Texas.
We drove down to Texas.

3089
02:21:12,110 --> 02:21:15,470
How long have you guys been here?
Four plus months.

3090
02:21:15,500 --> 02:21:17,480
Your kids are holding up remarkably 
well.

3091
02:21:17,770 --> 02:21:18,850
Oh,
they are awesome.

3092
02:21:19,480 --> 02:21:20,560
Having a good old time.
Yeah.

3093
02:21:20,580 --> 02:21:22,550
Oh yeah.
At least in front of you.

3094
02:21:24,680 --> 02:21:26,480
There's been some good arguments on the 
way,

3095
02:21:26,481 --> 02:21:28,250
but they have pretty good.
I'm like,

3096
02:21:28,251 --> 02:21:29,084
fuck.
They lIke eva locked in a trailer or 

3097
02:21:30,500 --> 02:21:31,333
locked in the car or were in like an 
airbnb or something like that and they 

3098
02:21:34,231 --> 02:21:35,064
were all gathered together and,
and it's not until you're around other 

3099
02:21:38,151 --> 02:21:38,984
people's kids that you realize how good 
your own kids are like that because I'm 

3100
02:21:41,511 --> 02:21:42,700
always like,
you know,

3101
02:21:42,730 --> 02:21:46,460
and then they give a random occasion 
like fuck our kids is science,

3102
02:21:46,470 --> 02:21:47,450
you know,
santa claus.

3103
02:21:50,590 --> 02:21:52,990
But yeah.
Then we went from Texas to Utah,

3104
02:21:53,030 --> 02:21:56,810
hung at Utah for a wall.
Then I drove back to Colorado,

3105
02:21:56,811 --> 02:21:58,610
come back to Utah again.
Well,

3106
02:21:58,650 --> 02:21:59,483
what's ironic is that you as an 
australian and your family as 

3107
02:22:01,461 --> 02:22:03,440
australians are getting to see more of 
americans,

3108
02:22:03,441 --> 02:22:06,620
most americans ever do like fucking get 
out there and do it.

3109
02:22:06,650 --> 02:22:08,250
Get out there And get out there and do 
it.

3110
02:22:08,260 --> 02:22:11,810
A beautiful place we live in.
I think some people don't have the means

3111
02:22:11,811 --> 02:22:12,644
to.
Yeah,

3112
02:22:13,340 --> 02:22:14,173
and that's why people are driving for 
this fuck traffic every day to try and 

3113
02:22:16,461 --> 02:22:18,080
make the means to do that,
you know?

3114
02:22:18,530 --> 02:22:19,970
Yep.
Yeah.

3115
02:22:20,560 --> 02:22:22,850
But it's a grind out there fuckers.
Yeah.

3116
02:22:22,910 --> 02:22:24,080
It's a grind.
Yeah.

3117
02:22:24,081 --> 02:22:24,914
The traffic does my fucking head in 
concrete does my head in mass paper do 

3118
02:22:27,841 --> 02:22:30,890
my head in like I'm walking around 
disney like a duck.

3119
02:22:31,310 --> 02:22:32,143
But isn't it fun to do like every now 
and again to go to New York city every 

3120
02:22:35,011 --> 02:22:38,930
now and again?
Just go jesus fucking people you been.

3121
02:22:38,940 --> 02:22:41,310
Have you been in New York?
It's crazy.

3122
02:22:41,430 --> 02:22:44,670
That's the trippiest trip and all of 
this fucking wild as country.

3123
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:45,833
I think the reason why hunters get so 
much flack from a lot of people is 

3124
02:22:49,711 --> 02:22:53,770
because I asked in that they don't know 
the upper end of things.

3125
02:22:54,480 --> 02:22:55,313
They don't know the wilderness side of 
things because they fucking jammed in 

3126
02:22:57,181 --> 02:22:58,014
there.
I always think like that's why I love 

3127
02:22:59,071 --> 02:22:59,904
promoting it as well.
So much like people don't even know 

3128
02:23:01,381 --> 02:23:03,210
about this.
They don't even know exists.

3129
02:23:03,211 --> 02:23:04,740
They don't even know this is something 
you can do.

3130
02:23:04,741 --> 02:23:05,574
They don't know the rewards from it,
so they feel morally detached from the 

3131
02:23:08,731 --> 02:23:09,564
food that they're reading.
like they don't feel like an obligation 

3132
02:23:11,910 --> 02:23:15,960
to their food.
They don't feel like they don't need me.

3133
02:23:15,970 --> 02:23:17,970
It's just a steak.
There's no,

3134
02:23:17,971 --> 02:23:20,850
there's no connection.
And because of that they don't feel like

3135
02:23:20,851 --> 02:23:22,200
they did anything wrong.
No,

3136
02:23:22,201 --> 02:23:25,710
that's wrong.
Whereas if you shoot a font and you know

3137
02:23:25,711 --> 02:23:26,431
and you're like,
oh,

3138
02:23:26,431 --> 02:23:30,270
he shot a baby,
what do you think?

3139
02:23:30,271 --> 02:23:32,190
Your veal is stupid.
What do you think?

3140
02:23:32,200 --> 02:23:35,670
Laminate had full.
Everything was out of the rack of lamb.

3141
02:23:35,860 --> 02:23:36,960
Yeah,
you ordered a baby.

3142
02:23:37,320 --> 02:23:39,720
That's a baby.
Lamb is a baby sheep.

3143
02:23:39,850 --> 02:23:41,150
Fuck.
But most people,

3144
02:23:41,180 --> 02:23:42,080
it's weird.
I don't.

3145
02:23:42,100 --> 02:23:44,610
So I don't hate on it because I 
understand it like that.

3146
02:23:44,670 --> 02:23:48,660
The population of the world demands,
but if someone hates on me for it,

3147
02:23:48,720 --> 02:23:51,210
then you've got a point of out.
I'm sTill not heightened on it.

3148
02:23:51,380 --> 02:23:53,820
I'm just pointing it out.
Or you're doing the same thing,

3149
02:23:53,821 --> 02:23:56,990
but someone else is doing it for you.
It's out of ignorance for sure.

3150
02:23:57,060 --> 02:23:57,893
Yeah,
and even if you're a vegan or 

3151
02:23:58,801 --> 02:24:00,490
vegetarian,
you know,

3152
02:24:00,660 --> 02:24:01,493
that's still kills animals.
Like have a look at the cleared land to 

3153
02:24:05,161 --> 02:24:07,470
be a vague and they need to clean land,
you know,

3154
02:24:07,471 --> 02:24:09,570
so it's like that's that whole middle 
ground again.

3155
02:24:09,810 --> 02:24:12,080
Yeah.
Unless your farm yourself.

3156
02:24:12,930 --> 02:24:13,763
If everyone went vegan,
we'd fucking have to clear massive 

3157
02:24:15,901 --> 02:24:16,734
amounts of land,
kill massive amounts of animals and 

3158
02:24:18,271 --> 02:24:19,230
everything like that.

3159
02:24:19,530 --> 02:24:23,080
Do you know what I mean?
Went hunting is then fuck them.

3160
02:24:23,100 --> 02:24:25,380
Would slaughter the fuck out.
It's so much wildlife.

3161
02:24:25,381 --> 02:24:27,030
It's not funny.
On top of that,

3162
02:24:27,031 --> 02:24:29,730
you wouldn't be able to just let those 
animals loose.

3163
02:24:30,600 --> 02:24:31,620
Let all the cows,
louis,

3164
02:24:31,670 --> 02:24:34,560
you slamming into fucking cars on the 
street.

3165
02:24:35,300 --> 02:24:40,300
Just devastating like know ground that 
can't be trampled on like that.

3166
02:24:41,100 --> 02:24:42,330
But it's that middle ground.
Yeah.

3167
02:24:42,480 --> 02:24:44,880
Some vegans and vegetarians a good,
you know,

3168
02:24:44,890 --> 02:24:45,723
some hunters and not a good.
And then there's that middle ground 

3169
02:24:47,551 --> 02:24:50,570
which is all the normal cunts,
you know,

3170
02:24:50,580 --> 02:24:52,650
that just understand like I've got a 
mate,

3171
02:24:52,950 --> 02:24:54,960
it's not actually damaging,
you know,

3172
02:24:54,961 --> 02:24:56,960
I can eat some vegetables that's not 
damaging.

3173
02:24:57,030 --> 02:24:59,930
It's just everything in its place.
Yeah,

3174
02:24:59,950 --> 02:25:00,783
no,
that's what your perspective is very 

3175
02:25:02,521 --> 02:25:03,354
healthy.
That it's good to have these extreme 

3176
02:25:04,621 --> 02:25:06,840
animal rights activist because it 
balances everything out.

3177
02:25:06,850 --> 02:25:07,683
We need balance.

3178
02:25:08,640 --> 02:25:10,920
I agree.
Just don't fucking mouth off at me about

3179
02:25:11,090 --> 02:25:12,460
it.
It

3180
02:25:13,980 --> 02:25:14,813
sounds so much better with an australian
accent because really so normal in 

3181
02:25:17,641 --> 02:25:21,330
Australia started.
Even when your wife says that,

3182
02:25:21,331 --> 02:25:23,520
it's just like it's normal.
Normal.

3183
02:25:23,680 --> 02:25:27,190
So our friend sam soho,
which uh,

3184
02:25:27,490 --> 02:25:30,160
he put up a post and it was about some 
politician.

3185
02:25:30,880 --> 02:25:31,631
Yeah,
there you go.

3186
02:25:31,631 --> 02:25:33,100
Beautiful.
And was wearing a shirt earlier.

3187
02:25:33,101 --> 02:25:35,000
he makes an awesome shirt.
yeah.

3188
02:25:35,230 --> 02:25:36,930
I was sweaTing it and otherwise I'd wear
it here.

3189
02:25:37,450 --> 02:25:38,470
Public land.
Diana.

3190
02:25:40,270 --> 02:25:42,380
That's it by the sam.
Hell yeah.

3191
02:25:42,620 --> 02:25:43,453
Oh boy.
So he put this post up and it's about 

3192
02:25:44,951 --> 02:25:46,380
this politician that,
you know,

3193
02:25:46,410 --> 02:25:47,350
he,
he goes,

3194
02:25:47,351 --> 02:25:49,960
you know,
it's a pretty decent fucking riding that

3195
02:25:49,961 --> 02:25:51,220
he's done up about,
you know,

3196
02:25:51,221 --> 02:25:52,054
how the guy's not doing his job and 
stuff like that and they're going to 

3197
02:25:53,591 --> 02:25:54,424
take these public what land away from us
or close it and I'm in the comments on 

3198
02:25:58,331 --> 02:26:01,170
like,
so basically what you're saying is these

3199
02:26:01,270 --> 02:26:05,920
account,
we can get there a little quicker.

3200
02:26:06,170 --> 02:26:07,003
He's doing,
he's not doing his job and fuck some 

3201
02:26:10,301 --> 02:26:14,080
people took offense to it,
but sam explained to him.

3202
02:26:14,081 --> 02:26:15,040
He's like,
he's an australian,

3203
02:26:16,800 --> 02:26:19,990
it's a prison colony here.
It's like,

3204
02:26:20,560 --> 02:26:21,393
oh,
you know,

3205
02:26:21,410 --> 02:26:24,190
it's like saying I'm not even going to 
say it.

3206
02:26:24,540 --> 02:26:25,120
Fuck it.
Yeah.

3207
02:26:25,120 --> 02:26:26,950
So it's a bad word.
It's a bad word.

3208
02:26:27,210 --> 02:26:30,820
Does not like over there.
It's like a gentle fucker.

3209
02:26:30,821 --> 02:26:33,340
Hey
jamie.

3210
02:26:33,580 --> 02:26:34,640
Jamie walked in here.
I go,

3211
02:26:34,670 --> 02:26:36,610
hey fucker.
If he said that to me,

3212
02:26:36,611 --> 02:26:37,091
I'd be like,
hey,

3213
02:26:37,091 --> 02:26:40,180
what's up is normal.
There's four things you can't do.

3214
02:26:40,181 --> 02:26:42,820
You can't say anything bad about what 
talent hunting.

3215
02:26:43,190 --> 02:26:45,340
Can't say anything bad about fucking 
jesus.

3216
02:26:45,670 --> 02:26:49,780
You can't say the word can't.
And I can't remember what the fourth one

3217
02:26:49,800 --> 02:26:54,550
wasn't something the american flag like 
fucking dog go.

3218
02:26:54,551 --> 02:26:59,470
They leave the flag alone.
Leave the fucking flag is beautiful.

3219
02:26:59,500 --> 02:27:02,250
That motherfucker out lyrics on dude.

3220
02:27:02,310 --> 02:27:04,020
We just did three hours again.
Wow.

3221
02:27:04,450 --> 02:27:07,510
Just flew by wild,
crazy coffee.

3222
02:27:07,730 --> 02:27:09,520
It's coffee.
This rooms rooms and god.

3223
02:27:09,530 --> 02:27:10,321
Damn time.
Fuck.

3224
02:27:10,321 --> 02:27:13,430
I wanted kanye to be in yet at the same 
time so we can gang up and even told him

3225
02:27:13,431 --> 02:27:14,264
in the bowhunting silicon right here.
Killer mike's coming out of the podcast 

3226
02:27:18,341 --> 02:27:19,560
soon.
He said that,

3227
02:27:19,561 --> 02:27:21,670
uh,
he wants to go elk hunting with me,

3228
02:27:21,671 --> 02:27:23,560
but his wife won't let them hunt with 
white people.

3229
02:27:23,900 --> 02:27:27,370
So I told her that one point six percent
african.

3230
02:27:27,371 --> 02:27:31,420
So thanks for having me on the show.
It's always,

3231
02:27:31,421 --> 02:27:32,860

my friend.

3232
02:27:33,010 --> 02:27:36,930
And we got to schedule another one night
trip in northern territory or
