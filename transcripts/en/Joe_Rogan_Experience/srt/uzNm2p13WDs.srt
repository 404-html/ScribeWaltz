1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,670
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,140
You get two of you
together and you're like,

3
00:00:03,141 --> 00:00:05,450
let's go eat some coyote
and see what it tastes like.

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:05,730
Yeah,

5
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,270
well I'm going to have to eat
one spin sneaking around my yard.

6
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,950
They're trying to figure out
how to get to my chickens.

7
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:11,420
Sneaky Fox.

8
00:00:11,421 --> 00:00:12,254
It's so weird.

9
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:13,191
Oh,

10
00:00:13,191 --> 00:00:13,960
I know they will.

11
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:14,900
He's fucking creeps.

12
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:15,861
I was in my,

13
00:00:15,861 --> 00:00:16,580
uh,

14
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:17,420
I was in my yard.

15
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,870
I'll just about to let the chickens
out and I see this motherfucker looking

16
00:00:20,871 --> 00:00:21,704
through the fence,

17
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,170
just looking right at me and
looking at the chickens and like,

18
00:00:24,171 --> 00:00:24,471
Whoa,

19
00:00:24,471 --> 00:00:25,400
that's kind of creepy.

20
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,610
It's like you have imagined having a
friend and you know that the friend is

21
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:29,000
safe,

22
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,980
but right outside the door you could
see a guy wants to kill your friend and

23
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,120
he's just trying to figure
out a way to get in.

24
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,170
That's what it was.

25
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,280
He's going to get in and kill your
friend with his face and his chickens are

26
00:00:39,281 --> 00:00:40,101
like my little friends,

27
00:00:40,101 --> 00:00:40,401
you know,

28
00:00:40,401 --> 00:00:40,540
they,

29
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,271
they lay eggs.

30
00:00:41,271 --> 00:00:42,350
I say hello girls.

31
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:42,920
You know,

32
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,470
I feed them.

33
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:43,760
They,

34
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,571
they bucking,

35
00:00:44,571 --> 00:00:45,710
they come near you when the,

36
00:00:45,711 --> 00:00:45,980
you know,

37
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,410
when you come out and
this conti fucking dog,

38
00:00:48,411 --> 00:00:49,640
once they eat my friends,

39
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:50,390
I had a,

40
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,171
we had some chickens,

41
00:00:51,171 --> 00:00:51,390
you know,

42
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:51,921
we're deciding,

43
00:00:51,921 --> 00:00:52,161
okay,

44
00:00:52,161 --> 00:00:54,590
we're going to let them free cause they
gotta they gotta get out and they got a

45
00:00:54,591 --> 00:00:57,350
pack and they got to get some
bugs and they're just happier.

46
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,120
So we let the chickens out.

47
00:00:59,121 --> 00:00:59,540
Well,

48
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,100
I didn't know their
neighbor had a rooster.

49
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,510
The rooster comes over,

50
00:01:02,511 --> 00:01:02,830
right.

51
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,250
He just claims my chickens.

52
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:06,020
And so you'd go out to feed the chickens.

53
00:01:06,021 --> 00:01:07,220
The rooster would come attack you.

54
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:07,810
I mean,

55
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,170
he would just get up there,

56
00:01:09,171 --> 00:01:10,280
spur your legs,

57
00:01:10,281 --> 00:01:11,020
everything.

58
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:11,290
Yeah.

59
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,021
So I mean,

60
00:01:12,021 --> 00:01:14,930
this is crazy rooster and we could
not keep him away from the chickens.

61
00:01:14,931 --> 00:01:15,051
I mean,

62
00:01:15,051 --> 00:01:16,190
he's raping my ladies.

63
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,553
I want,

64
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,440
my goal was the unfertilized
chicken eggs in a lot of balloons.

65
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,450
So we're trying to think like,

66
00:01:23,451 --> 00:01:25,310
we can't kill this dude's rooster.

67
00:01:25,311 --> 00:01:25,491
I mean,

68
00:01:25,491 --> 00:01:26,540
that's just not right.

69
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:31,190
So I got this concrete rooster and
I put it out by the chicken coop.

70
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,280
That rooster comes over and just
starts fighting this concrete rooster.

71
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,110
He kicked his own ass and just left,

72
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:37,283
came back.

73
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,800
So if you have rooster problems,

74
00:01:39,801 --> 00:01:40,030
man,

75
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:40,560
just,

76
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,930
just get a statue.

77
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,860
That's his own ass.

78
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,620
That's amazing.

79
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:47,480
What a dumb fucking animal.

80
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,060
He was like scared to come down,

81
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:51,650
right?

82
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:52,483
Stupid.

83
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:53,751
Everything's good.

84
00:01:53,751 --> 00:01:54,130
Joe,

85
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,070
you a real comedian.

86
00:01:55,071 --> 00:01:59,150
Dom Merera you just saying that for
folks who didn't listen to the commercial

87
00:01:59,151 --> 00:01:59,780
part,

88
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,860
you don't have a tool.

89
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:01,970
You know you'd ever done a thing.

90
00:02:01,971 --> 00:02:03,020
He never turned a wrench.

91
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,700
There's two bucks.

92
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:07,340
There's two toolboxes and warehouse and
they would have left two women that live

93
00:02:07,341 --> 00:02:09,500
with me that I had a broad tool boxes.

94
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,900
I can't even lift it.

95
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,290
It was one of the key lift.

96
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,510
I don't know how Sophie lifted it.

97
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,070
That's hilarious.

98
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,100
Every time somebody shakes my hand,

99
00:02:19,101 --> 00:02:19,281
they go,

100
00:02:19,281 --> 00:02:19,491
man,

101
00:02:19,491 --> 00:02:20,450
you don't have soft hands.

102
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,553
All the butter,

103
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,120
the leg butter smooth.

104
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:24,200
Yeah.

105
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,190
That's uh,

106
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:25,850
that's,

107
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,800
I really feel believed
that there's a real,

108
00:02:27,801 --> 00:02:32,780
there's a real factor in that you've
remaining on top of your game all these

109
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:32,930
years.

110
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,690
Like you surely you truly like completely.

111
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,650
You know,

112
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:37,610
you're a comedian.

113
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,220
That's it.

114
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,200
That's what you're capable of.

115
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,043
I love it.

116
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,810
I could do it in a hammock.

117
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,270
I followed crystal Leah
the other night at the,

118
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,840
he did a standing ovation and lift factor,

119
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:47,270
right.

120
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,060
I walk in and this was true.

121
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,120
I had just woken up.

122
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:54,050
I took a nap like at nine o'clock at
night and the audience was standing.

123
00:02:54,051 --> 00:02:54,884
I got it now.

124
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:55,461
I said,

125
00:02:55,461 --> 00:02:56,021
first of all,

126
00:02:56,021 --> 00:02:57,470
it's Chris just got a standing ovation.

127
00:02:57,471 --> 00:02:58,370
I just woke up.

128
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,620
I said,

129
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,453
uh,

130
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,520
I was just in the bath
tub like a big fat fag.

131
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,930
So Lazy.

132
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,650
The only reason I was
taking a birth coach,

133
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,360
too lazy to stand up and shape.

134
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,430
Right.

135
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,460
And I said that a crown.

136
00:03:10,461 --> 00:03:11,920
Then what would you do if you were me?

137
00:03:11,921 --> 00:03:13,030
What the fuck am I supposed to do?

138
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:14,110
Fly around the room,

139
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:15,010
you know?

140
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:15,843
What do you mean after he,

141
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:16,540
yesterday,

142
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,510
after we had a standing ovation and am
I supposed to fly around the room as it

143
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:19,691
now?

144
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:20,381
Tell me what to do.

145
00:03:20,381 --> 00:03:20,951
And then you know,

146
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:22,510
they were with me because it was honest,

147
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,351
you know?

148
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:23,981
But the thing is,

149
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:26,330
what of what you were saying about just I,

150
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,670
I give a fuck totally,

151
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:28,570
but I don't give a fuck.

152
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:30,310
Like I could do it in a
hammock at this point.

153
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,320
Just be,

154
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,870
let's just my head out doing stand.

155
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,300
That's actually not a bad idea.

156
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,330
That be pretty funny
for 10 to be a good act.

157
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,950
You were just laying there,

158
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,720
especially like if you,

159
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,520
it was a part of like a comedy festival,

160
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,470
not even a regular set.

161
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:45,720
Just like ladies and gentlemen,

162
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:50,650
we present you dom Irrera and a hammock
and you just swinging back and forth

163
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:53,200
with a wireless microphone
in the air and talking shit.

164
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,800
When you look at the Warren
Commission report and you look at the

165
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:57,880
inconsistencies in it,

166
00:03:57,881 --> 00:04:00,730
there's a great book about it called
the best evidence by David Liftin,

167
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:01,661
who was,

168
00:04:01,661 --> 00:04:02,080
um,

169
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,490
he was actually an accountant and was
hired to go over the Warren Commission

170
00:04:06,491 --> 00:04:10,150
report and found inconsistency after
inconsistency over and over again.

171
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:11,770
A detailed these in great order,

172
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:16,510
but dif difference in the inconsistency
of the autopsies and consistencies of

173
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,930
the various reports of what went down in
consistencies in the Warren Commission

174
00:04:19,931 --> 00:04:22,150
of their findings that would
cancel out each other's findings.

175
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:25,870
He was in one of the few guys with the
first guys to go through the entire 900

176
00:04:25,871 --> 00:04:26,704
volumes.

177
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:27,371
Fascinating,

178
00:04:27,371 --> 00:04:31,210
fascinating book that I read
when I was living in New Jersey.

179
00:04:31,211 --> 00:04:31,411
I was a,

180
00:04:31,411 --> 00:04:33,010
it was living in New York rather,

181
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:38,160
and I was doing a Gig on the road and I
read it and fucking bombed that night.

182
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,791
All my God,

183
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:43,270
it was in my hotel room all day reading
is freaky conspiracy books shitting my

184
00:04:43,271 --> 00:04:47,590
pants and I was like 23 years old and
then I went on stage that night and just,

185
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,430
I hate it.

186
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,263
It's terrible.

187
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:49,581
And I,

188
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:51,880
I learned a very valuable
lesson from that book.

189
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,590
Don't read or watch depressing shit
right before you go onstage or break into

190
00:04:56,591 --> 00:04:59,180
big conspiracy mongering in the
middle of your set that you just know.

191
00:04:59,230 --> 00:04:59,411
No,

192
00:04:59,411 --> 00:05:01,480
but I became a conspiracies
break for sure.

193
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:02,230
For sure.

194
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,870
That book best evidence was
what threw me over the top.

195
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,920
I've had to really distinctive times
where the things that I saw on before I

196
00:05:08,921 --> 00:05:10,660
went onstage fucked me up.

197
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:11,920
That was a big one.

198
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,840
That was probably the first one.

199
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,740
Might have been the second one.

200
00:05:14,741 --> 00:05:15,431
It was all the same time.

201
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:16,264
It was a slow learner,

202
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,740
but the other one was a,

203
00:05:17,741 --> 00:05:18,940
I went with uh,

204
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:19,893
um,

205
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:20,201
uh,

206
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:21,520
this guy named JB smooth,

207
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:21,701
you know,

208
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:22,534
JB smooth,

209
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,433
funny fucks.

210
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,431
He's hilarious.

211
00:05:24,431 --> 00:05:29,170
And Jb and I were doing a college
together in New Jersey and a JB was a,

212
00:05:29,171 --> 00:05:30,130
it was really hard to find.

213
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:30,830
And J B,

214
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,150
uh,

215
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:31,511
was,

216
00:05:31,511 --> 00:05:31,840
uh,

217
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,650
he was running late,

218
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,240
so they had me go on first.

219
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,050
And I wasn't prepared because
I was sitting in the Er there.

220
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,570
They had a little rec room with a TV on
and the TV was showing this documentary

221
00:05:40,571 --> 00:05:41,770
on the Malibu fires.

222
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,870
Uh,

223
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,550
it was so fucking depressing.

224
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,140
It was the early nineties,

225
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,820
and these people lost everything.

226
00:05:48,821 --> 00:05:50,260
And this guy was crimes,

227
00:05:50,261 --> 00:05:53,770
a fireman and he was crying and
wheat and his house was still there,

228
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,630
but his neighbors had lost their houses.

229
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,160
And he was just crying,

230
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:57,591
weeping.

231
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:59,090
This girl was looking for her dog.

232
00:05:59,300 --> 00:05:59,990
And they like,

233
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,261
all right,

234
00:06:00,261 --> 00:06:00,651
Joe,

235
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,960
I'm JB is still late.

236
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:05,900
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna
put you on and you do your sat and then

237
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:06,800
he'll go on after you.

238
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:07,670
I was like,

239
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,750
oh no.

240
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:11,720
So I went on stage thinking
about this guy crying,

241
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,220
not even for his own loss,

242
00:06:13,221 --> 00:06:14,510
but for his neighbors loss.

243
00:06:14,511 --> 00:06:15,950
And that girl looking for a dog.

244
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:20,951
And I just got so sad and I went on stage
at age shit when I was in high school.

245
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:21,411
Uh,

246
00:06:21,411 --> 00:06:22,580
I don't remember the kid's name,

247
00:06:22,581 --> 00:06:24,470
but someone wrote a really cool article,

248
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:25,011
uh,

249
00:06:25,011 --> 00:06:25,401
one of the,

250
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:26,750
one of the kids in my school,

251
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:27,161
uh,

252
00:06:27,161 --> 00:06:29,270
about boy scouts,

253
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,190
about the problem with the whole,

254
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:31,580
uh,

255
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:35,930
the code of the boy scouts because one
of them was keeping your thoughts clean.

256
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:36,550
Those that,

257
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:36,800
right.

258
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,280
Yeah.

259
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,510
I forget the exact,

260
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:38,810
let's,

261
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,760
let's put a boy scout code.

262
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,220
So you get to thinking about
something and you're like,

263
00:06:43,221 --> 00:06:43,491
man,

264
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:44,470
I shouldn't be thinking about that.

265
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:46,910
Well,

266
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:47,960
this guy was,

267
00:06:47,961 --> 00:06:48,590
uh,

268
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,610
the guy who wrote this.

269
00:06:49,611 --> 00:06:51,170
I remember reading this as I was,

270
00:06:51,171 --> 00:06:51,760
uh,

271
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,091
you know,

272
00:06:52,091 --> 00:06:53,210
a high school student going,

273
00:06:53,211 --> 00:06:54,560
this guy's got a really
good fucking point.

274
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,210
The point was like,

275
00:06:56,211 --> 00:06:56,961
what do you give a fuck?

276
00:06:56,961 --> 00:06:59,390
What I think like why are you
trying to control my thoughts?

277
00:06:59,391 --> 00:07:00,440
Like I'm not hurting anybody.

278
00:07:00,441 --> 00:07:02,600
I might think something crazy and deviant,

279
00:07:02,601 --> 00:07:05,420
but I'm not doing it if as
long as I'm not doing it.

280
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:05,660
Oh,

281
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,340
why am I supposed to
keep my thoughts pure?

282
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:10,140
Maybe it's fun for me to
entertain ridiculous thoughts.

283
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:10,881
I know.

284
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:12,920
Cause that's Kinda like
what self control is.

285
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:16,780
Like self control doesn't
speak to that thought.

286
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,690
The idea is you entertain SelfControl
speaks to or it's like you get an email

287
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,620
and you're like,

288
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,180
I'm going to write a
really mean email back.

289
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,370
But,

290
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:24,860
and then you,

291
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,870
it's so fun to imagine
what you're saying to me.

292
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:27,703
An email,

293
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,420
I'm to put it up,

294
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:28,970
it's Molly.

295
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:32,270
Like you write a regular email and
that is like supposed to be like adult

296
00:07:32,271 --> 00:07:32,930
behavior.

297
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:33,700
Exactly.

298
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,370
Yeah.

299
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:34,970
Control.

300
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:35,241
Yeah.

301
00:07:35,241 --> 00:07:35,531
And we'll,

302
00:07:35,531 --> 00:07:35,931
you know,

303
00:07:35,931 --> 00:07:37,850
someone's willing to sold
trolling your actions.

304
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,430
You see someone who's an asshole on the
car and you want to pull them out of the

305
00:07:40,431 --> 00:07:41,450
car and beat him to death,

306
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,583
but you don't,

307
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:43,730
you don't do anything.

308
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,593
You just go,

309
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:45,540
you drive down.

310
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,221
Yeah.

311
00:07:46,221 --> 00:07:46,610
I would,

312
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:47,990
I would pull his fingernails out

313
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,120
so his eyes open and throw salt in
them and make them stare at the sun.

314
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,110
I never go there.

315
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,230
I just go to bone breaking right away.

316
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:58,760
Snap someone's arm.

317
00:07:58,761 --> 00:07:59,870
They don't want to fight back.

318
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:00,620
Um,

319
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:00,861
yeah.

320
00:08:00,861 --> 00:08:01,611
Trustworthy,

321
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:02,031
loyal,

322
00:08:02,031 --> 00:08:02,481
helpful,

323
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:02,991
friendly,

324
00:08:02,991 --> 00:08:03,471
courteous,

325
00:08:03,471 --> 00:08:03,951
kind,

326
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:04,611
obedient,

327
00:08:04,611 --> 00:08:05,181
cheerful,

328
00:08:05,181 --> 00:08:05,691
thrifty.

329
00:08:05,691 --> 00:08:06,261
Brave,

330
00:08:06,261 --> 00:08:06,870
clean.

331
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:07,703
Reverent.

332
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,130
A scout is reverend towards God.

333
00:08:10,131 --> 00:08:11,870
He's faithful in his religious duties.

334
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,240
He respects the belief of others.

335
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,201
Yeah.

336
00:08:15,201 --> 00:08:15,861
Here's the big one.

337
00:08:15,861 --> 00:08:16,970
Clean a scout,

338
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,400
