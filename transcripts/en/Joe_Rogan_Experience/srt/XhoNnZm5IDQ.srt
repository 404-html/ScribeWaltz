1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,210
I'm not interested.
Five,

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:04,870
four,
three,

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,460
two,
one.

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,560
Yes,
we're live data.

5
00:00:10,561 --> 00:00:11,011
Yes.
Russell,

6
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,780
you going no headphones?
You're radical.

7
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:14,730
Well,
you knew that dude.

8
00:00:14,731 --> 00:00:16,950
I'll take the headphones off with you.
I don't give a fuck.

9
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,490
Let's go.
Bring it on.

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,260
I feel better.
I feel liberated.

11
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,560
Not Know what the real sounded to look.
Slim and healthy.

12
00:00:25,561 --> 00:00:26,520
What have you been doing?
Thank you.

13
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,413
I just,
I got back in the gym and I'm doing 

14
00:00:29,161 --> 00:00:32,580
boxing and kickboxing still and active.
Yeah.

15
00:00:32,581 --> 00:00:33,140
Well,
you know,

16
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,410
you know I'm in Oregon a lot,
so the meth is awesome up there.

17
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,060
They do have good speed rate for weight 
control.

18
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,680
I would think that Oregon would be more 
of like a calm down type of state as far

19
00:00:43,681 --> 00:00:45,860
as drugs.
I was just there for four times.

20
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,120
I emailed you.
Yeah,

21
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:51,750
I love it up there man.
I would bet they're fucking the winter,

22
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:53,920
so goddamn depressing,
but I would still do it.

23
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:58,230
This winter has been just ridiculous.
It's rained for nine months straight.

24
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:02,070
There were like 500 inches in my county.
Jesus this winter,

25
00:01:02,071 --> 00:01:04,830
but a beautiful green.
Oh God.

26
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:07,830
It's so lush when I just.
When you get out of the PDX airport,

27
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,570
it just,
you smell pine trees as soon as you walk

28
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:10,404
out of the airport.
I mean it's amazing and after being an 

29
00:01:11,911 --> 00:01:12,744
la,
which is just basically like this giant 

30
00:01:13,771 --> 00:01:15,650
desiccated Turd.
I mean it's like,

31
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,160
it's,
it's so nice.

32
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,023
Yeah.
That would be like the best place to 

33
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:19,824
live.
Like if you had a place there and a 

34
00:01:21,211 --> 00:01:22,044
place here you go back and forth,
you deal with total dry and total when 

35
00:01:24,941 --> 00:01:27,630
I'm doing it kind of balance itself.
Nailed it.

36
00:01:27,631 --> 00:01:28,630
Mr Russell.
Thank you.

37
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:30,780
You nailed it.
I'm commuting every week and people say,

38
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,640
yeah,
don't you get sick of this?

39
00:01:32,641 --> 00:01:34,290
I actually love it so far,
so far.

40
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:35,660
Yeah.
So my son here,

41
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,930
my son is here,
he goes to school here.

42
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:40,440
In fact he goes to school right near 
where we're sitting and uh,

43
00:01:40,441 --> 00:01:42,720
so I have an apartment here and then a 
house in Salem,

44
00:01:42,721 --> 00:01:45,510
Oregon and I love it.
Going back and forth.

45
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,160
I'm not,
I'm kind of like a shark.

46
00:01:47,161 --> 00:01:48,330
I can't,
I need to keep moving.

47
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,330
I don't like I get,
I feel claustrophobic and like the world

48
00:01:51,331 --> 00:01:53,520
is passing me by if I'm sitting in one 
place too long.

49
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,590
Have you always been like that?
I'm digging it.

50
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,850
Yeah.
Always.

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,070
I always need to be doing something and 
moving.

52
00:01:59,071 --> 00:02:01,770
I get I am literally claustrophobic.
Yeah.

53
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,663
Yeah.
And have you ever done an isolation 

54
00:02:04,261 --> 00:02:05,094
tank?
Oh my God.

55
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,933
Yeah,
I know when you talk about that I'm 

56
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,310
freaked out.
That's my worst nightmare.

57
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,151
Whoa.
Like,

58
00:02:09,151 --> 00:02:10,830
and I'm also a little bit afraid of the 
dark.

59
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,650
I knew you were going to laugh at that.
You're gonna.

60
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:16,760
Call me a girl again.
No.

61
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,730
Wrong with being a girl by the way.
How dare you?

62
00:02:20,731 --> 00:02:21,810
Oh yeah.
Well we'll get into that.

63
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,700
We'll get into that.
No,

64
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,210
uh,
I mean like pitch black that,

65
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,190
that freaks me out.
I really can't see anything.

66
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,053
I can't stand that.
I don't mind a very dark room if you 

67
00:02:32,011 --> 00:02:33,300
can.
As long as I can see something.

68
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:35,490
But if it's pitch black,
I freak the fuck out.

69
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,680
You know what freaks me out?
Vision Goggles.

70
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,330
Well,
that's what I want right then.

71
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:42,770
I'm cool if I hadn't seem so weird.
They put them on.

72
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,613
You feel like you're in a horror movie 
or you're in one of those scenes and 

73
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,970
most stupid ghostbuster shows where 
they're down in the basement.

74
00:02:47,971 --> 00:02:49,770
They always have night vision on.
Yeah.

75
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,210
Have you tried them on?
Yes.

76
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,140
Oh yeah.
I have some.

77
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,880
Of course you do.
Of course you do.

78
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,270
For like nighttime boar hunting over 
there,

79
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,163
whatever it is.
That is one of the reasons why they use 

80
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:00,454
them

81
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,140
for.
Then it's scopes.

82
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:06,250
They have night vision scopes or where 
you see the infrared version of the pigs

83
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:08,080
moving around.
It's very weird to look through them,

84
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,363
but people often mistake other things 
for pigs like deer and not like that 

85
00:03:12,371 --> 00:03:13,270
idea.
I haven't tried them on,

86
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:14,104
but I liked that idea,
but you know like spelunking is 

87
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:16,960
definitely out for me.
You know,

88
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,580
claustrophobic and afraid of the dark 
spelunking caving.

89
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,783
Oh yeah.
It's like the idea of being like in a 

90
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:23,974
tight one of those tight little caves 
you have to like squeeze your body 

91
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:28,750
through in the pitch dark and your 
headlamp goes out.

92
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,240
I was just listening to,
it was my worst night,

93
00:03:30,241 --> 00:03:31,074
asked about this family that owns a 
ranch in Texas and they had these small 

94
00:03:35,831 --> 00:03:39,780
caves and these kids would explore and,
and then um,

95
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,400
they allowed some cavers,
some local,

96
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,273
you know,
cave explorers to go and check it out 

97
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,470
and they crawl through this really 
small,

98
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:48,304
like three foot diameter hole,
like literally crawled through it and 

99
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:51,934
found two football field size caves 
inside and then found out that there's 

100
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,540
literally miles of cave systems in 
there.

101
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:02,020
Oh yeah.
No,

102
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,390
it's incredible.
I wish I weren't terrified of it because

103
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:08,530
I love all the other stuff in the 
outdoors and backpacking and camping and

104
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:09,460
hiking.
I do all that.

105
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:10,294
I love it.
But going underground is the worst 

106
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,223
thing.
You only backpack and camp when it's a 

107
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:15,574
full moon.

108
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,990
A No,
I'm cool with the stars.

109
00:04:19,991 --> 00:04:21,220
That's good enough.
Good enough.

110
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:22,570
Headlamps,
like I said,

111
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:25,900
it was pitch black when you can't see 
your hand in front of your face.

112
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,880
That freaks me out and I don't 
understand why people,

113
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:28,803
other people don't freak out about that.
Like I'll wake up in a hotel room and I 

114
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:32,584
forgot to,
or there's no light at all on for 

115
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:34,924
whatever reason,
I'll freak out because I don't know 

116
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,470
where I am.
See,

117
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,383
look,
look what I'm already admitting to 

118
00:04:38,951 --> 00:04:40,870
millions of people.
I just got here,

119
00:04:40,871 --> 00:04:41,704
man.
I'm already like,

120
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,820
I'm already like a girl and putting up 
your opening.

121
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:45,723
You keep saying girls,
if it's like a week thing that sparked 

122
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:49,810
me the first time I was here,
he called me a girl.

123
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:51,130
It's stuck with me.
I'm sorry,

124
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,233
I don't even remember it now.
You just said you sounded like a girl 

125
00:04:53,621 --> 00:04:54,454
just then.

126
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,020
Really,
what did I say about.

127
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,760
I can remember what it was about.
I can't remember something.

128
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,100
Something really critically.
Pretty girlish pretty.

129
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,970
So it's been um,
portland,

130
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,380
the Portland area.
What are you doing up there?

131
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,633
So my girlfriend,
who I live with as a vice president at 

132
00:05:09,611 --> 00:05:10,444
willamette university and I teach part 
time just for the hell of it at 

133
00:05:13,091 --> 00:05:13,924
Willamette.
But mostly I'm developing all these 

134
00:05:14,801 --> 00:05:16,080
other things.
And,

135
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,230
and mostly just enjoying Oregon.
So because man you can,

136
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,310
you can afford a hell of a house in 
Salem,

137
00:05:21,311 --> 00:05:23,620
Oregon for what you were paying in La.
Let me tell you.

138
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,193
So we're just living a lot better.
First Time in my life I've been in a 

139
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:30,700
house that I enjoyed being in and that's
nice.

140
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,593
Yeah.
And so it's great and it's given me a 

141
00:05:32,801 --> 00:05:33,634
base to do these projects,
my new podcast and renegade university 

142
00:05:37,631 --> 00:05:38,530
and write my book.

143
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,713
It's great.
I have my own studio in the house and I 

144
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:42,154
have my own office in the house.
So it's like kind of the command center 

145
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:46,450
up there.
That's nice.

146
00:05:46,451 --> 00:05:47,590
Yeah.
So it's been,

147
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,640
it's been pretty awesome lately.
I think it's fascinating how some places

148
00:05:51,641 --> 00:05:52,474
like some cities have like a mindset.
There's a field that you get from the 

149
00:05:56,261 --> 00:05:59,030
city and liked the field that you get 
from Portland.

150
00:05:59,031 --> 00:06:01,610
Yeah,
I mean it's like it's a aware city,

151
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,670
you know,
and it's not a dumb city because they're

152
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:09,410
aware they're woke woke as fuck.
Yeah.

153
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:10,920
But it's like a white,
like a white bloke,

154
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:11,660
white work,
whatever.

155
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,493
It might logos a little pretentious.
I think somewhere along the line 

156
00:06:15,891 --> 00:06:20,540
Portland became like a place that 
pretentious people gravitated to because

157
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,120
they wanted to identify like,
I'm white and I have dreadlocks.

158
00:06:23,121 --> 00:06:24,380
Here I am.
You know what I mean?

159
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,990
Like they make really good food.
Those pretentious people,

160
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,940
their food carts or coffee.
Yeah,

161
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:29,960
yeah,
yeah.

162
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,540
They make great food and those food 
trucks are out of this world.

163
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:33,321
Totally.
Totally.

164
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:34,910
Yeah.
Portland is a great city,

165
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:38,640
except have you noticed the hid all the 
black people this four or five of them?

166
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:42,170
I've seen,
I've only seen mountain lions.

167
00:06:42,171 --> 00:06:43,004
I keep waiting to like come across the 
cage where they keep them in the one 

168
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:47,750
corner of the city because then it's 
amazing.

169
00:06:47,751 --> 00:06:50,030
Especially in like the core of Portland,
Maine part.

170
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,390
All you do not see any black people.
You don't see the Mexicans,

171
00:06:53,391 --> 00:06:56,030
you don't see Japanese people.
It is just white people.

172
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:56,923
Dude with beards.
That's like a Pacific northwest selling 

173
00:06:58,671 --> 00:07:00,500
coffee.
You see more of it in.

174
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,780
You definitely see more black people in,
in Seattle.

175
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:05,990
So it's definitely pretty diverse.
Not fully,

176
00:07:05,991 --> 00:07:07,850
but a lot of Asian folks for sure.

177
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,013
But uh,
yeah,

178
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:09,711
Portland,
I mean,

179
00:07:09,711 --> 00:07:12,190
not even,
not even Latinos and Asians,

180
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,390
like how do you do that on the west 
coast?

181
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,450
Where do you put all those people?
If you're on the west side,

182
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:17,890
pass by there,
just go with it.

183
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,000
Let's keep going.
Vancouver's right up the street.

184
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,180
Hey you,
you took a wrong turn.

185
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:23,961
Keep going.
Just keep walking.

186
00:07:23,961 --> 00:07:25,580
Let's just keep going north.
Yeah.

187
00:07:25,581 --> 00:07:28,220
It's like it's,
it's a small city.

188
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,160
I mean I don't think Portland has more 
than a million people.

189
00:07:31,161 --> 00:07:32,330
Right.
Does it now?

190
00:07:32,331 --> 00:07:34,340
I think it's like,
it's like half a million.

191
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,140
Is it really?
I think something like that.

192
00:07:36,141 --> 00:07:36,830
Yeah,
it's small.

193
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,663
I know it.
The lack of diversity actually is the 

194
00:07:40,341 --> 00:07:42,620
only problem I have with it and it's a 
fairly big problem,

195
00:07:42,621 --> 00:07:43,454
but that's an issue.
But otherwise it's the best city in 

196
00:07:45,171 --> 00:07:46,900
America I think.
Really.

197
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,230
It's my favorite city in America.

198
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,030
Yeah,
I should say.

199
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,210
It was pretty.
God damn good.

200
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,280
Lawrence Krauss lives there I am.
So there you go.

201
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,680
Yeah,
there's two of us to complete to.

202
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:57,140
Cool people are smart people.
I don't live in Portland,

203
00:07:57,141 --> 00:07:57,891
right?
I live in Salem,

204
00:07:57,891 --> 00:08:00,230
which is an hour south,
but we're still important that a lot,

205
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:01,064
so it's kind of is that because of the 
university will and because it's way 

206
00:08:03,861 --> 00:08:08,600
cheaper to live there and it's also 
really beautifully centrally located.

207
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:09,434
So we've got.
We're an hour and 10 minutes from the 

208
00:08:10,821 --> 00:08:11,870
coast,
which is gorgeous.

209
00:08:11,871 --> 00:08:13,280
Have you been to the Oregon coast?
Yes.

210
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,173
Amazing.
Yeah.

211
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,223
And then we're an hour and a quarter 
from the cascade mountains on the other 

212
00:08:17,061 --> 00:08:17,894
side.
And then all around Salem is the 

213
00:08:20,391 --> 00:08:21,224
Willamette valley,
which is like Napa Valley and Sonoma 

214
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,910
county meet Vermont.
It is so beautiful.

215
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,773
Just readily beautiful farmland all 
around there to make a lot of wine up 

216
00:08:29,901 --> 00:08:31,430
there.
Two incredible wine.

217
00:08:31,431 --> 00:08:33,470
The pinot noir is the best in the world.
Yeah,

218
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,390
but it's really pretty.
Just driving through there,

219
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:36,500
so.
Whew man.

220
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:37,241
That's.
Yeah,

221
00:08:37,241 --> 00:08:38,380
I'm telling you,
we have.

222
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:41,120
Salem has Mexican,
so we do have a little diversity because

223
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,313
all the farm workers,
there's a substantial population of 

224
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,050
Latinos.
You have legit Mexican instead.

225
00:08:48,051 --> 00:08:49,220
We got in St Louis,
uh,

226
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,120
not like working on it.
We're working on it.

227
00:08:53,121 --> 00:08:53,954
I mean,
Salem has been like a dumpy town for a 

228
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,160
long,
long time

229
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,910
until just recently.
Um,

230
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:58,803
and now it's starting to pick up.
We got some stuff going on and we've 

231
00:09:01,281 --> 00:09:03,570
been.
Now we've got a good mma gym there.

232
00:09:03,571 --> 00:09:06,600
And a boxing gym just just opened.
Legitimate.

233
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,100
Yeah,
like team quest people,

234
00:09:08,101 --> 00:09:10,110
former team quest people.
What was the trainers?

235
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:13,830
Nick Gilardi who's a,
he actually came up with chill and randy

236
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:14,730
couture,
he was,

237
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:18,540
he was trained as a wrestler by them 
when they were doing wrestling only when

238
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:19,374
he was a kid and then he became a 
champion wrestler and then they went 

239
00:09:21,211 --> 00:09:22,770
into fighting and he was like,
okay,

240
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:23,604
I'll do that with you.
And he's a major sort of northwest mma 

241
00:09:26,371 --> 00:09:29,220
fighter and now he's like,
coach of the year in the northwest.

242
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,390
Oh Great.
He's my coach.

243
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,850
We have a little image.
It's really good mma gym in,

244
00:09:32,851 --> 00:09:34,860
uh,
in Salem called impact.

245
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,330
That's awesome.
Impact Jujitsu.

246
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,440
So your knee is.

247
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,600
We're talking about this before the 
podcast you need,

248
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:40,434
feels like it's good enough.
And I really would love to start 

249
00:09:42,601 --> 00:09:43,830
grappling.
I never have.

250
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,960
And I'm scared of it because of all the 
takes,

251
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,200
especially the take downs and you know,
and the leg locks and all that.

252
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,560
So I don't know,
but I'm doing it.

253
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,220
I'm still doing just standup boxing and,
and um,

254
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,210
and Moitai kick boxing.
Have you ever done any yoga?

255
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,520
Yes.
Yes.

256
00:09:59,521 --> 00:10:01,360
It's great for me.
Uh,

257
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,950
I can help my knee.
It will definitely help your name.

258
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,190
I guess so.
I mean stretching it,

259
00:10:05,191 --> 00:10:07,170
help.
Just strengthening and strengthening.

260
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,700
I mean just holding static positions 
like static yoga positions for your back

261
00:10:11,701 --> 00:10:14,310
and for your knees and your feet until 
this does.

262
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,530
I'm a broken record with this shit.
So I'll stop right now.

263
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,413
Lost people.
People listening to this podcast like 

264
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,070
Jesus is gonna fucking talk about yoga 
again.

265
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,953
I love it.
Yeah.

266
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,630
So we don't,
we don't have to talk.

267
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:23,970
No,
no,

268
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:24,803
no,
that's,

269
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,170
I'm all about that drink gatorade man.
Cause I'm,

270
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,720
I'm.
This is not good for you.

271
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:29,783
That's triggering.
This is terrible for you that you might 

272
00:10:31,261 --> 00:10:33,060
as well be drink because I get dry mouth
around it.

273
00:10:33,061 --> 00:10:34,080
You scare me.
I'm sorry.

274
00:10:34,081 --> 00:10:35,400
I'm just kidding.
He's scared of the dark.

275
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:39,320
Scared of scary looking at you,
Mr. Muscles.

276
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,790
Listen,
now that you're all leaned out,

277
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,830
you're scared of muscle people.
Yeah.

278
00:10:43,831 --> 00:10:44,350
No,
it's,

279
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,520
um,
it's,

280
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,680
it's interesting place.
It's a,

281
00:10:46,681 --> 00:10:48,990
it's a truly sort of like it's trump 
country,

282
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,720
trump country.
It's like,

283
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,913
it's,
it's dudes with beards who are not 

284
00:10:55,261 --> 00:11:00,261
hipsters who drive pickup drugs real and
have a lot of guns and um,

285
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:04,860
they don't give a fuck basically.
And it's sort of,

286
00:11:04,861 --> 00:11:05,694
um,
it's not really a conservative socially 

287
00:11:07,441 --> 00:11:08,274
conservative place is more of a kind of 
libertarian thing and basically this is 

288
00:11:11,731 --> 00:11:13,500
my land,
don't mess with me.

289
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,330
So it very much was the libertarian 
option kind of kind of,

290
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,530
kind of.
Most Libertarians hated him,

291
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,393
so they would be better off with someone
who's an actual libertarian like Ron 

292
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,210
Paul.
He's type character.

293
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,400
He's the only reason libertarians were 
attracted.

294
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,121
Well,
there's two reasons,

295
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:30,954
but the main one was that they were 
attracted to him because during the 

296
00:11:32,911 --> 00:11:33,744
campaign at least he was saying things 
that sounded like he was a non 

297
00:11:37,741 --> 00:11:39,540
interventionist in foreign policy.
Right.

298
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:42,270
And that's why I was at least interested
in him.

299
00:11:42,271 --> 00:11:44,990
I thought there was a possibility there.
Of course he would like,

300
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,223
you know,
for 30 minutes he would talk like Ron 

301
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:48,923
Paul about foreign policy and then the 
last 30 minutes of his speech he would 

302
00:11:51,601 --> 00:11:54,010
sound like an old republican about how 
you wanted to bomb the shit out of

303
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,510
people.
So who knows.

304
00:11:55,511 --> 00:11:56,344
But now of course,
I think what's happened is that the 

305
00:11:58,271 --> 00:11:59,104
generals have taken over.
I think establishment has just taken 

306
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:02,020
over.
Well,

307
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,853
it seems like there's,
there's no way one person can run every 

308
00:12:06,341 --> 00:12:08,710
single facet of being the president,
especially not him.

309
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,623
Yeah.
And he's got 100 different businesses 

310
00:12:11,381 --> 00:12:13,780
worldwide that are constantly ongoing 
right now.

311
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:14,683
Anything about the world.
So of course he's going to rely on 

312
00:12:16,841 --> 00:12:18,850
experts and he also,
we all knew this all along.

313
00:12:18,851 --> 00:12:21,340
He loves generals.
He loves that thing.

314
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,220
And I,
I,

315
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:26,800
it's pretty clear that madness came in 
there and just took over his mind.

316
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,820
And um,
he said,

317
00:12:27,821 --> 00:12:28,391
okay,
yeah,

318
00:12:28,391 --> 00:12:29,770
I guess you,
I was right about all that shit.

319
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,100
Let's go.
Essentially said I'm going to get out of

320
00:12:33,101 --> 00:12:35,540
their way and let the military do their 
job.

321
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,453
Exactly.
And like I know guys that are like 

322
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,580
re-enlisting because they're pumped.

323
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,610
They think that the military,
like Tim Kennedy a UFC fighter,

324
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,360
he reenlisted enlisted because he 
believes that the UFC forever,

325
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:47,243
the UFC,
he believes that the military now has 

326
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:49,714
the backing and the support from the 
president and that this is going to be 

327
00:12:53,411 --> 00:12:54,790
great and they can do their job.
Now.

328
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:56,320
Kennedy,
one to,

329
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,770
uh,
serve in combat because he really was.

330
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,200
He really wants to go to oil and 
possibly die.

331
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,123
Oh yeah.
He's doing that right now because he 

332
00:13:04,781 --> 00:13:07,100
believes in the car.
Does he belong to percent?

333
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,110
Yeah.
Where?

334
00:13:08,111 --> 00:13:09,700
Which part?
I talked to him about it.

335
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:10,780
Isis.
What does he want?

336
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,370
He wants to kill his.
He's about Isis.

337
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,560
Oh Dude.
It gives his address out to isis.

338
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,650
Puts his address on the Internet.
Says fine.

339
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,150
Come get me.
I'd love to talk to Tim Kennedy.

340
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,070
Yeah.
It's a long conversation though.

341
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,910
I bet you would want six hours.

342
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:23,743
That's fine.
You would want to take pee breaks and 

343
00:13:25,241 --> 00:13:26,470
drink water.
And this.

344
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:31,450
Let's get into this from top to bottom.
I would love to want this smoothed out.

345
00:13:31,451 --> 00:13:34,360
CNN.
Seven minute presentation in between two

346
00:13:34,361 --> 00:13:36,730
talking heads on either side.
You don't want that.

347
00:13:36,731 --> 00:13:40,450
You want the long form.
Who is Tim Kennedy had?

348
00:13:40,451 --> 00:13:42,250
Why?
Why does Tim Kennedy feel this way?

349
00:13:42,251 --> 00:13:44,440
And that's what I will do.
An experience that's my podcast,

350
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,570
unregistered podcast.
That's what we do.

351
00:13:46,571 --> 00:13:47,680
And it's,
it's kind of a,

352
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,810
yeah,
that's precisely what we're doing.

353
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,703
I'm interested in people's personal 
histories and how it's connected to 

354
00:13:53,441 --> 00:13:54,970
their current ideas,
right?

355
00:13:54,971 --> 00:13:57,790
The roots of their political ideas,
where do they come from?

356
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:01,310
So it requires people who are self aware
about themselves and a lot of,

357
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,153
a lot of people aren't,
but so far my guests are people who 

358
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:08,080
really have a sense of the connections 
between what happened in their childhood

359
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:11,320
and the early development and,
and what they're thinking now.

360
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:14,320
It's a really interesting thing if you 
can get people to do that,

361
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:16,540
to connect those things,
to weave them together.

362
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,610
So if Tim Kaine,
I mean Tim Kennedy might know,

363
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,493
uh,
where his ideas about serving in the 

364
00:14:21,491 --> 00:14:23,220
military come from other than,
you know,

365
00:14:23,221 --> 00:14:25,300
my dad did it or,
or whatever it was.

366
00:14:25,301 --> 00:14:26,134
But that's what I'm interested in doing.
So and this form like what you're doing 

367
00:14:29,111 --> 00:14:30,310
here,
the long form.

368
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,960
I love it.
It's so much better.

369
00:14:31,961 --> 00:14:35,110
I think this is why I've know a lot of 
people didn't know me.

370
00:14:35,111 --> 00:14:38,440
I take most of the people who know me 
know me from my podcast appearances here

371
00:14:38,441 --> 00:14:40,990
and elsewhere have been on a lot of 
podcasts and I just,

372
00:14:40,991 --> 00:14:42,310
I,
I'm just more comfortable with it.

373
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,233
I just think it's the best way to go.
I hate being on cable news where it's 

374
00:14:46,181 --> 00:14:46,720
like,
you know,

375
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,553
two minutes or 30 seconds and get this 
complicated idea out right then and 

376
00:14:50,831 --> 00:14:51,560
that's it.

377
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,810
And even radio have done a lot of radio 
which just sucks,

378
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:54,680
you know,
it's the same thing.

379
00:14:54,681 --> 00:14:58,850
Twenty second sound bytes,
even 20 minute interviews.

380
00:14:58,851 --> 00:15:02,360
I always find frustrating either as an 
interviewer or as a guest,

381
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:04,760
even our long interviews.
Oh totally.

382
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:05,623
I did an interview with Ron miscavige is
the father of data and we only did an 

383
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:13,640
hour and a half and I was like,
if we did like three or four hours,

384
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:16,460
I probably get deeper and deeper into 
the student and find out,

385
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:17,541
well,
yeah,

386
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,410
that's it.
That's what you do.

387
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:19,443
So you go kind of,
you're always going in and out of 

388
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:23,990
people's personal histories and their 
psychology and then into their ideas and

389
00:15:23,991 --> 00:15:24,824
into big abstract stuff.
And then history and philosophy and 

390
00:15:26,481 --> 00:15:26,931
science,
right?

391
00:15:26,931 --> 00:15:27,764
You're going in and always back and 
forth and ended up connecting those 

392
00:15:29,661 --> 00:15:30,800
things,
weaving together.

393
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,360
That's.
I love that.

394
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,193
I think it's the only way to go.
You get the deepest understanding of 

395
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:35,834
people and it's,
it sort of makes it impossible to do 

396
00:15:37,911 --> 00:15:38,744
what most people do is,
which has just put people in a little 

397
00:15:40,191 --> 00:15:41,910
box and throw them away.
Right.

398
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:42,890
Dismissed,
you know,

399
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,820
oh,
he's a libertarian,

400
00:15:43,821 --> 00:15:45,500
oh,
he's a socialist or whatever,

401
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,423
dawn.
Right.

402
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,880
Um,
so you know,

403
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:49,820
he's Joe Rogan.
Oh,

404
00:15:49,821 --> 00:15:51,440
he's the UFC guy.
Gone,

405
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:52,323
right?
And I'm sure people do that to you all 

406
00:15:53,181 --> 00:15:54,560
the shore,
or he's Joe Rogan,

407
00:15:54,561 --> 00:15:57,320
the masculine macho dude not interested 
by,

408
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,510
right.
Everyone is so complex.

409
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,593
Um,
most people are and most people are not 

410
00:16:02,121 --> 00:16:04,850
the same person who they were.
If you're pulling a quote from them from

411
00:16:04,851 --> 00:16:07,280
two years ago or five years ago or 
whatever,

412
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:10,040
I'm just not that person anymore.
Everybody evolves.

413
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:10,903
Exactly.
And you can box someone into some sort 

414
00:16:12,891 --> 00:16:16,100
of a corner by like,
not to defend them,

415
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:16,934
but the,
grab them by the Pussy speech from 2005 

416
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:19,800
for example.

417
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,670
It's your boxing,
a guy in the corner who's trying to make

418
00:16:22,671 --> 00:16:25,940
another guy laugh on a bus and he's just
being gross.

419
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,570
Greg's.
And then you take that and go,

420
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:29,120
is this the guy who won for president?
Right.

421
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,770
Yeah.
We can talk about that a lot.

422
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:31,663
I mean,
I'm with you on that when I heard you 

423
00:16:32,371 --> 00:16:34,850
talking about that the other day.
But yeah,

424
00:16:34,851 --> 00:16:36,860
it's the trump.
I have a lot to say about that.

425
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:38,120
But um,
it's,

426
00:16:38,121 --> 00:16:39,740
um,
so anyway,

427
00:16:39,741 --> 00:16:42,970
I think the podcasting thing,
it's changing the game and it's,

428
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:43,823
it's so great.
It gives people something to do while 

429
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,370
they're doing other stuff.
Totally.

430
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:52,790
I think we're like 90 percent audio,
only downloads versus youtube,

431
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,260
somewhere,
somewhere in route.

432
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,453
So most people are either listening 
during the commute or while they're at 

433
00:16:58,311 --> 00:16:59,144
the gym or a lot of people even at work,
they'll put on headphones while they're 

434
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,440
doing mindless bullshit,
but I think what it does is it humanizes

435
00:17:06,441 --> 00:17:07,760
people,
right?

436
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,623
You get,
you get not the full humanity of a 

437
00:17:10,221 --> 00:17:11,054
person of course,
but you get much more of who they are 

438
00:17:13,371 --> 00:17:14,204
really and the complexities of them and 
so people talk about how we are all 

439
00:17:17,631 --> 00:17:19,550
being siloed now because of the 
Internet.

440
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,413
Right?
That we just go to the websites we do 

441
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,920
that agree with us and there's a lot of 
that for sure.

442
00:17:23,921 --> 00:17:24,930
Certainly,
but I think there's.

443
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,380
I actually think the overall effect is 
just the opposite.

444
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:28,214
I actually think that we have much 
deeper understandings of people who are 

445
00:17:31,191 --> 00:17:33,740
not like us because of things like this.
Right?

446
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,713
I mean,
because of the podcasts and because 

447
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,753
there's just much more exposure to 
people's ideas and personalities and 

448
00:17:40,311 --> 00:17:41,720
there's.
There's more people talking in public,

449
00:17:41,721 --> 00:17:42,770
by the way,
I mean,

450
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:43,820
just imagine that,
right?

451
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:46,910
Like in the 19 seventies and eighties 
when you and I were growing up,

452
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,980
there were three broadcast that all

453
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,813
said the same thing on the new shows.
There were three also said the same 

454
00:17:53,581 --> 00:17:56,760
thing because the FCC wouldn't allow any
competitors to come into the market.

455
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,480
I mean they just wouldn't allow it.
And then Rupert Murdoch broke that open.

456
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:01,463
Right?
And then since then it's just been 

457
00:18:02,341 --> 00:18:04,290
flooded.
So now we have how many channels,

458
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:08,730
how many networks?
I'm going to end up podcasts and so when

459
00:18:08,731 --> 00:18:11,760
I was coming up as an academic in the 
nineties,

460
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:12,743
if you didn't,
if your book didn't get reviewed in the 

461
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,253
New York Times or if you're an author of
any kind and your book didn't get 

462
00:18:18,211 --> 00:18:20,850
reviewed in the New York Times,
you were not going to make a living as a

463
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:22,170
writer.
That was it.

464
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,063
You had to get reviewed in the New York 
Times and it had to be a positive 

465
00:18:24,901 --> 00:18:25,734
review.
That was the only gatekeeper to success 

466
00:18:28,111 --> 00:18:28,944
as an author.

467
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,110
Now the New York Times is one of,
you know,

468
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:31,944
a hundred different places are a 
thousand different places that matter 

469
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,920
when you're writing books.
My book renegade history,

470
00:18:37,921 --> 00:18:41,880
the United States was ignored entirely 
by the New York Times and I know why,

471
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,100
but it didn't really matter.
People fly.

472
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,293
Oh,
because it says all the things you're 

473
00:18:45,961 --> 00:18:46,794
not supposed to say if you're a good 
liberal left liberal by coastal elite 

474
00:18:50,551 --> 00:18:52,770
person from university.
Like,

475
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,090
like,
um,

476
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:58,470
Martin Luther King was a conservative 
and hated black culture,

477
00:18:58,650 --> 00:18:59,483
you know,
like.

478
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,510
Yeah,
yeah,

479
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,153
yeah.
He was a very conservative person 

480
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,343
culturally,
and he was basically an opponent of 

481
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:07,150
black culture.
He,

482
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:08,940
he didn't,
he was opposed to rock and roll.

483
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,013
He didn't,
he didn't even mention jazz until the 

484
00:19:11,731 --> 00:19:12,420
19,
late,

485
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,253
late into his career.
And only once he thought black people 

486
00:19:15,691 --> 00:19:18,640
should sing classical music,
European classical music or,

487
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,980
or Gospel,
you know,

488
00:19:19,981 --> 00:19:22,260
very respectable,
very Christian,

489
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,450
very good citizen kind of stuff.

490
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:29,130
And he hated the flamboyant black 
preachers who were hooping and hollering

491
00:19:29,131 --> 00:19:29,964
in the,
in their churches and speak in black 

492
00:19:31,591 --> 00:19:32,880
dialect.
He wanted every,

493
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:36,660
all black people to speak,
correct American English.

494
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,003
Um,
he was opposed to a lot of dancing that 

495
00:19:40,231 --> 00:19:41,670
was going on.
He just,

496
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:44,430
all this stuff that we love in black 
culture,

497
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:45,623
Martin Luther King was opposed to,
it wasn't because he was just an 

498
00:19:47,341 --> 00:19:48,990
uptight,
puritanical prick.

499
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:52,200
It was because of his strategy and his 
objective,

500
00:19:52,201 --> 00:19:54,860
which was to seek full citizenship.
Right.

501
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:58,410
And he understood right?
In a way it wasn't his fault entirely.

502
00:19:59,130 --> 00:19:59,963
You have to prove yourself always in 
this country historically that you are 

503
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:04,014
just like white people to get all the 
good stuff to get the vote to get equal 

504
00:20:07,411 --> 00:20:10,560
protection under the law.
So that's what his mission was.

505
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,453
Assimilation,
assimilation has always been the ticket 

506
00:20:13,411 --> 00:20:14,880
to full citizenship man.

507
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,200
It's just,
it sucks that that's even a thought that

508
00:20:19,201 --> 00:20:20,034
the only way to achieve quote unquote 
full citizenship is to ignore all the 

509
00:20:23,971 --> 00:20:27,630
things that make black culture special.
Like comedy,

510
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,240
like Jazz,
like rap,

511
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:33,420
like just,
just slang,

512
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,570
just all the cool shit that black people
have figured out.

513
00:20:36,571 --> 00:20:40,110
Like the things to say that white people
have ruined.

514
00:20:40,111 --> 00:20:43,320
Like bro,
bro used to be like a cool thing.

515
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,183
Oh yeah,
black people say to each other and now 

516
00:20:45,331 --> 00:20:49,060
it's like an insult for a like a frat 
dummies a bro.

517
00:20:49,061 --> 00:20:52,540
Now we'll just think about like,
thinking about America now,

518
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,750
if black people had never been here,
what would it be like?

519
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,880
Which I'm not sure I'd want to live 
here.

520
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:01,150
We wouldn't even have blues.
So like what kind of musical we have.

521
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:06,160
Blues is the roots of all pop music,
but all music comes out of blues.

522
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,470
Everything that's pop music that's not 
European.

523
00:21:08,471 --> 00:21:10,420
Classical music has comes from black 
people.

524
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,320
Original roots basically.
Of course whites were involved in it,

525
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,180
you know,
of course all that music but,

526
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,730
but all that stuff,
the roots of it are in this lives.

527
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,790
It will even European rock,
like led Zeppelin will.

528
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:24,700
They borrowed it.
Those guys asked the Beatles.

529
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:26,560
They talked about this stuff.
The stones,

530
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,600
you talked about it all the time.
They like a,

531
00:21:28,601 --> 00:21:29,410
you know,
we're not,

532
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:31,450
we are not the rolling stones without 
muddy waters.

533
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,313
Of course.
Les said it to all of that sort of 

534
00:21:35,111 --> 00:21:35,944
stemmed from.
It's fascinating when you really think 

535
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:40,210
about.
So that's the whole history of.

536
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,373
That's African American history actually
is a ordinary black people who aren't 

537
00:21:47,141 --> 00:21:50,440
interested in being just like white 
people and doing their thing,

538
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,670
you know,
since slavery,

539
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,100
I'm just doing their thing and being 
called niggers by whites and also,

540
00:21:57,101 --> 00:22:00,460
and this is what people don't know,
civil rights leaders since slavery,

541
00:22:00,461 --> 00:22:02,980
like black political leaders who wanted 
citizenship,

542
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:07,960
attacking them for their culture just as
harshly as the Ku Klux Klan did.

543
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,793
And I'm not exaggerating if you look at 
what Frederick Douglas said about slave 

544
00:22:12,401 --> 00:22:15,450
culture,
if you look at what Web Dubois sometimes

545
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,820
said about slave culture and black 
culture than Martin Luther King,

546
00:22:18,821 --> 00:22:20,830
a Philip Randolph,
Jesse Jackson,

547
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,660
Al Sharpton,
all the way through,

548
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:27,910
they are saying the harshest nastiest 
things about black working class,

549
00:22:27,911 --> 00:22:31,060
popular culture you could imagine.
But again,

550
00:22:31,061 --> 00:22:31,894
it was for this reason,
they wanted to convince whites that we 

551
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:37,660
are just like them.
So they'll let us in the.

552
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,840
Let us sit at the table of America.
They'll give us the vote.

553
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:45,910
We can then become president.
And so guess what happened?

554
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:51,450
They finally,
a guy came along who was black looking,

555
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,153
but who,
who lived in this perfect nuclear 

556
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:02,500
Christian family wife,
two kids didn't drink,

557
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,330
didn't do drugs,
he smoked,

558
00:23:04,331 --> 00:23:06,430
but he stopped smoking pretty quickly.
Right?

559
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:10,030
Very dignified,
spoke perfect English.

560
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,590
Right?
And guess what happened?

561
00:23:11,591 --> 00:23:13,030
He became our first black president.

562
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:17,950
So Obama is absolutely the apotheosis is
a good academic word.

563
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,450
He's the pinnacle.
He's the,

564
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,480
he's the full achievement of that long 
attempt by civil rights leaders,

565
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:29,611
black political leaders to assimilate 
blacks and they won in that way.

566
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,100
They got a president.
But what else did they win?

567
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,593
Right?
And doing that.

568
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,940
Not much.
I mean race relations.

569
00:23:36,941 --> 00:23:38,170
Now,
are they better now?

570
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:42,460
Not really.
Do Black people still say stuff in their

571
00:23:42,461 --> 00:23:45,410
hip hop songs that is not respectable 
even more than ever.

572
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:47,283
Um,
and white people or black people are 

573
00:23:49,551 --> 00:23:51,470
thinking when they're doing their hip 
hop songs,

574
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:52,970
they're not thinking that they're 
representing.

575
00:23:52,971 --> 00:23:56,360
All black people are thinking they're 
representing their vision right there,

576
00:23:56,361 --> 00:23:58,400
representing what they see on the 
street,

577
00:23:58,401 --> 00:23:59,930
what they see in their neighborhood.
Exactly.

578
00:23:59,931 --> 00:24:00,711
Yeah,
exactly.

579
00:24:00,711 --> 00:24:02,140
That's always going to be the case,
right?

580
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,450
The people.
This is the thing,

581
00:24:03,451 --> 00:24:04,284
you know,
I mean people who actually are from 

582
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,330
those neighborhoods,
you know,

583
00:24:08,331 --> 00:24:09,770
where there really aren't any white 
people,

584
00:24:09,771 --> 00:24:11,090
you know,
if they're from the projects are,

585
00:24:11,091 --> 00:24:12,400
they're from,
you know,

586
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,510
these poor black neighborhoods that are 
famous,

587
00:24:14,511 --> 00:24:14,770
right?

588
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:15,603
I mean by and large,
and we know this from what they say in 

589
00:24:17,421 --> 00:24:19,160
their art,
you know,

590
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:22,490
don't give a shit about what white 
people think about them,

591
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,130
right?
They're not interested in citizenship.

592
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:27,020
They're not interested in being good 
Americans.

593
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:28,700
They're doing their thing,
as you just said.

594
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:30,380
I mean,
they're interested in represent seems to

595
00:24:30,381 --> 00:24:31,214
me they're interested in representing 
their aspirations and their interested 

596
00:24:34,671 --> 00:24:38,840
in having a good time,
which sounds trivial to a lot of people,

597
00:24:38,841 --> 00:24:40,520
but it's actually revolutionary,
right?

598
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:41,354
If you just,
if you're interested only in having a 

599
00:24:42,831 --> 00:24:46,850
good time and pleasure and succeeding 
and achieving things for yourself,

600
00:24:46,851 --> 00:24:49,640
that's actually not American because 
you're not interested in America.

601
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:51,470
You're interested,
interested in yourself.

602
00:24:51,471 --> 00:24:52,304
So that's a person who's very unlikely 
to volunteer like Tim Kennedy to go 

603
00:24:55,971 --> 00:24:57,600
serve in the military.
Right?

604
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:00,440
It's very unlikely that that person will
become a cop.

605
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:03,800
It's unlikely that that person will obey
the laws,

606
00:25:03,801 --> 00:25:04,670
will obey the,
the,

607
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:07,220
the actual laws and then the cultural 
laws.

608
00:25:07,221 --> 00:25:08,054
They're not going to be good Americans.
They're out for themselves and I think 

609
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,653
that's actually always historically for 
more than 200 years provided this 

610
00:25:15,021 --> 00:25:15,854
alternative for white people.
We've always looked at that like with 

611
00:25:19,731 --> 00:25:22,610
this sort of Split Lens,
like part of it says,

612
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:23,780
Goddamn,
look at those.

613
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,570
Look at those primitive black people.
They do.

614
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:27,590
They're doing the bad stuff.
We were not like them.

615
00:25:27,591 --> 00:25:30,560
We're better than that and always 
simultaneously,

616
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,720
most or many white people have looked at
and said,

617
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,100
hm,
that looks.

618
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,020
That looks more fun than what we're 
doing.

619
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:39,380
Maybe we'll do that for a while.
Certainly young white,

620
00:25:39,381 --> 00:25:41,570
suburban kids that grow up in these 
safe,

621
00:25:41,571 --> 00:25:46,571
sheltered environment,
it's always adopt that sort of a radical

622
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:52,170
bad ass black rapper,
sort of listening to their music,

623
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:56,660
wearing their pants low,
like sag and doing all that stuff.

624
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:01,010
Coopting various aspects of black 
culture that seemed to be dangerous.

625
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:04,130
You know who you just described who?
My son.

626
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,570
Oh No,
no.

627
00:26:05,571 --> 00:26:06,231
Don't say,
oh no,

628
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:09,360
it's good as you sagging.
I'm saying I'm pro wigger,

629
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:13,430
son sags.
They don't sag anymore.

630
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,380
This is the new thing is these ripped 
jeans.

631
00:26:15,381 --> 00:26:18,640
That's hip hop style chips.
Genes behind the top,

632
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:20,780
kind of like fitted.
They don't sag,

633
00:26:20,781 --> 00:26:23,030
but they're like just shredded almost 
like an eighties look.

634
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,270
And I said,
I said to my son,

635
00:26:24,271 --> 00:26:25,250
I said,
I said,

636
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,470
you know,
back in the eighties,

637
00:26:27,471 --> 00:26:28,304
like we laughed at those genes but for a
totally different reason and now that's 

638
00:26:30,411 --> 00:26:32,240
the coolest thing that black people 
were.

639
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,040
Oh,
so he's doing all that.

640
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:35,900
He's.
He is fully immersed.

641
00:26:35,901 --> 00:26:38,390
He is.
He studies rap lyrics.

642
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:40,640
He knows all that stuff.
How old is he?

643
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:42,560
He's making beats.
He's 15.

644
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:43,973
Yeah.
So

645
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:46,630
it kind of martial arts,
queer kind of see why train?

646
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,480
I'm saying no,
he refused.

647
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,343
Really?
I tried to get them in there a couple 

648
00:26:50,011 --> 00:26:50,844
times.
Good for discipline that Joe Schilling 

649
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:55,500
and I think that scared scared of me 
when I met Joe.

650
00:26:55,501 --> 00:26:56,334
Scary Dude was my first gym.
I walked in the first day and I had 

651
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:03,480
never done anything like that and I walk
in and there was job and I was like,

652
00:27:03,481 --> 00:27:04,314
okay,
if people like that are going to be 

653
00:27:05,761 --> 00:27:06,480
doing this,
I'm not.

654
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,850
I'm not having any part of this name is 
just terrifying,

655
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:11,370
but when you get to know him,
he's a teddy bear.

656
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,810
He's awesome and big old sweet.
Awesome.

657
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,800
Great coach.
Great Guy.

658
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:14,760
Yeah.
Yeah.

659
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,680
I love.
Just think for a young boy,

660
00:27:16,681 --> 00:27:18,870
like it's a great way to sort your head 
out.

661
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,570
I think life is so I.
If I didn't find martial arts when I was

662
00:27:21,571 --> 00:27:22,404
that age,
who the fuck knows what started when I 

663
00:27:23,911 --> 00:27:24,210
was.

664
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:26,460
I was just thinking about this.
I started when I was 41.

665
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,610
Wow.
Yeah.

666
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:30,300
I took my suffering is doxing lesson 
when I was 41.

667
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,650
Wow.
How's Your Double Jab?

668
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,930
Church street really took off the job.
Oh yeah.

669
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:36,360
Hell yeah.
If you started at 41.

670
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,790
Yeah.
Got some speed to it.

671
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,653
Yeah.
Yeah.

672
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:39,720
I got a good job.
Really?

673
00:27:39,721 --> 00:27:40,554
Yeah.
Yeah,

674
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:41,460
yeah.
Interesting.

675
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:45,270
Told this tall guy.
I got some holes in my game.

676
00:27:45,271 --> 00:27:49,000
Think about Klitschko a Joshua.
This weekend's during fight pouring.

677
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,800
Those guys are boring.
Joshua's got nice job,

678
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:52,080
was not boring.
He's.

679
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:54,540
He's got great power.
Is Techniques okay?

680
00:27:54,541 --> 00:27:56,790
He's not great.
I think Klitschkos got a nice jacket,

681
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:00,420
put people to sleep.
So this is why the heavyweight division,

682
00:28:00,421 --> 00:28:01,350
no one cares about it,
right?

683
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:06,300
People to sleep the other way by being 
boring and being not silly,

684
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:08,290
but Joshua puts people to sleep.
Josh,

685
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,160
he knocks people out,
which is fun to watch and I'm into that,

686
00:28:11,161 --> 00:28:12,180
but it's not.

687
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,380
I like,
I just love technique.

688
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:15,750
Like I'm a student,
so like Loma Chenko Guy.

689
00:28:15,751 --> 00:28:18,690
So thank you for bringing La Loma.
Thank you for bringing him up.

690
00:28:18,691 --> 00:28:22,380
We got to talk about this.
Forget my career podcast.

691
00:28:22,381 --> 00:28:23,280
History.
Fuck all this shit.

692
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,270
Who Don't know.
Go on right now.

693
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,253
And Google Vasiliy Loma Chenko.
He might be the best boxer that's ever 

694
00:28:32,521 --> 00:28:33,680
lived.
He might be.

695
00:28:33,681 --> 00:28:36,030
So I was worried about that.
We were going to fight about this,

696
00:28:36,031 --> 00:28:39,660
but I think we're on the same page here.
So he's on such another level.

697
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:43,680
So I footwork and movement.
I just can't come up with a comparable.

698
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:44,723
I mean there's been some amazing boxers 
way back to sugar ray Robinson and 

699
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:51,240
Willie pap and all those guys paved the 
way,

700
00:28:51,241 --> 00:28:54,060
but I feel like everything evolves,
right?

701
00:28:54,061 --> 00:28:54,894
Every combat sport,
even art and music evolves to the 

702
00:28:57,601 --> 00:29:00,540
current state it's at now,
which you get the best of the best right

703
00:29:00,541 --> 00:29:01,620
now and you go,
wow.

704
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:02,603
They've learned from Ali and Sugar Ray 
Leonard and Roy Jones and Bernard 

705
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:11,730
Hopkins and Loma Chenko is in my eyes,
is the best way he moves is insane.

706
00:29:11,731 --> 00:29:13,470
Yeah,
and he's super aggressive.

707
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:17,250
He's not like floyd mayweather who is 
arguably the best ever,

708
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:20,700
you know,
multiple time world champion in multiple

709
00:29:20,701 --> 00:29:22,200
divisions.
Forty nine in.

710
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:26,340
Oh,
only been like hit solid maybe seven,

711
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:27,183
eight times his whole salary once when 
he got a little rock by Shane once and 

712
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,453
then my donna cracked him once,
but that's like over the course of this 

713
00:29:37,021 --> 00:29:40,830
spectacular career,
but much more defensive oriented,

714
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:43,840
brilliantly defensive,
very economical with this approach,

715
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:46,080
but brutal hands hurts them,
hurts his hand,

716
00:29:46,081 --> 00:29:47,590
breaks his hands a lot.
Not a lot of power.

717
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,453
Loma Chenko is on you like glue stands 
right in front of you and you can't hit 

718
00:29:51,701 --> 00:29:53,680
him.
And he's going left and he's going right

719
00:29:53,681 --> 00:29:54,514
and he's in and he's out and you don't 
know where the fuck he is and he's 

720
00:29:56,411 --> 00:29:57,180
lightening you up.

721
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,590
So what does this.
Here's why Wassily Lemme check goes.

722
00:29:59,591 --> 00:30:02,140
Now the number one pound for pound 
fighter in boxing.

723
00:30:02,141 --> 00:30:03,920
What's that in Forbes?
Damn,

724
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,793
for.
Technically he can't be because his 

725
00:30:06,581 --> 00:30:07,630
record,
he doesn't.

726
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:09,650
He hasn't really been tested.
He goes,

727
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:10,391
no,
no,

728
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:10,880
no,
I'm,

729
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,713
I'm with you completely.
I'm just saying technically he doesn't 

730
00:30:13,691 --> 00:30:15,620
have enough fights.
I don't give a fuck to be number one.

731
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,600
I know he's the best.
So let me just say so here's my history.

732
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:19,443
Let me try again so I can figure.
It was like four or five years ago I 

733
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:23,404
thought Gary Russell Jr was the greatest
thing since sliced bread and I still 

734
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:28,690
think he's just phenomenal.
Incredibly fast.

735
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,900
The fastest hands since Roy Jones easily
and maybe even faster,

736
00:30:31,901 --> 00:30:35,620
just technically just perfect.
I thought he was unbeatable.

737
00:30:35,621 --> 00:30:38,020
I thought he was the next thing and he's
still great.

738
00:30:38,021 --> 00:30:38,711
Great.
Great fighter.

739
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:39,520
I love him.

740
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,630
He fought Lemme check on.
I was like,

741
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:42,020
who's this Russian dude?
I don't even know.

742
00:30:42,021 --> 00:30:43,090
He's your cranium.
Never heard of him.

743
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,700
And he took.
He took russell apart.

744
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,140
Yeah.
Here's a highlight reel.

745
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:49,840
Look it.
He stands right in front of people.

746
00:30:49,841 --> 00:30:53,380
Man.
He just has such brilliant movement,

747
00:30:53,381 --> 00:30:54,370
man.
I mean,

748
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,233
he's like the perfect example of like 
the new wave like this state right 

749
00:31:02,771 --> 00:31:04,940
there.
What do you want this side to movement?

750
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,680
Yeah,
he does this.

751
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,760
He does this.
It's a hop.

752
00:31:06,761 --> 00:31:07,594
Actually.
He hops inside and he'll throw a body 

753
00:31:10,331 --> 00:31:11,950
shot off of it when it gets inside on 
you,

754
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,020
but he's basically standing at your 
side.

755
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:14,721
Boom.
Like right there.

756
00:31:14,721 --> 00:31:17,230
I did it again.
It's not like a brutal puncher.

757
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:20,630
He'll step in or hop in and you know,
the funny thing is,

758
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,360
so I've been hopping around Jim's 
lately,

759
00:31:22,361 --> 00:31:23,650
boxing gyms.
He's,

760
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,930
he did it like three times in a row and 
here's how.

761
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,530
Here's how I know.
Here's always there.

762
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:31,120
Here's why I think that he is the next 
Ali,

763
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:34,960
which is that just in the last year,
every boxing gym up,

764
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,813
gone to.
People have taught Loma Chanko moves 

765
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,830
like as a standard part of classes.
Interesting.

766
00:31:41,831 --> 00:31:43,750
Right?
Meaning that he's changing the game.

767
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:45,070
Right?
It's Kinda what you were saying.

768
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,023
Well,
you know Mike Tyson did a lot of that 

769
00:31:46,751 --> 00:31:47,440
too,
by the way.

770
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,140
People can to this lunch is hard as Mike
Tyson.

771
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:52,480
You can actually do some of this stuff.
Of course.

772
00:31:52,481 --> 00:31:54,280
He's a phenomenal athlete.
Loma Chanko is,

773
00:31:54,281 --> 00:31:55,114
and not everyone can do this,
but there are some things here that you 

774
00:31:57,701 --> 00:32:01,150
can do that had never been done before.
Like in particular,

775
00:32:01,151 --> 00:32:02,590
that little hop step.
It's actually,

776
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:03,563
I had a coach call it the,
I think it was called the Loma Chieko 

777
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,670
jump or something,
but you can do that.

778
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:07,983
You can.
You can just step in like that really 

779
00:32:09,281 --> 00:32:10,114
quickly,
but people for some reason just never 

780
00:32:11,501 --> 00:32:12,160
did it.

781
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,300
Well,
Tyson did do it.

782
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:15,030
Tyson learned it from customer.
No,

783
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,920
custom motto was teaching this way back 
in the fifties,

784
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,233
but his,
his style was Mike Tyson style was so 

785
00:32:21,761 --> 00:32:24,450
much different because he was throwing 
howitzers at you.

786
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:27,610
It's Loma Chanko is not knocking anybody
out with one punch.

787
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:27,910
No,
no.

788
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:30,460
He's hitting you with multiple barrage 
of punches,

789
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:32,800
but the thing about they dropped him 
with a liver shot,

790
00:32:32,801 --> 00:32:37,420
but the thing about like what Loma 
Chanko is doing with this steady barrage

791
00:32:37,421 --> 00:32:40,220
is very similar to what I've always said
about Jujitsu.

792
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,293
Like if you want to really learn Jujitsu
Jujitsu from a small man because small 

793
00:32:45,741 --> 00:32:50,570
men can't use strength and weight and 
all the physical advantages they have to

794
00:32:50,571 --> 00:32:51,404
use perfect technique.
So if you deal with guys like Eddie 

795
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,530
Bravo or Heuler gracie or a Barrett 
Yoshida,

796
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:02,000
like the really little guys are the guys
who have this stellar techniques because

797
00:33:02,001 --> 00:33:04,400
they don't have the physical strength 
with Loma Chanko,

798
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:05,120
you've seen the same thing.

799
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:05,953
He's not a one punch guy.
He doesn't have like some Tommy hearns 

800
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:09,773
Nacada ability or Mike Tyson type power,
so he's forced to have this brilliant 

801
00:33:14,271 --> 00:33:17,090
movement and footwork which is complete 
next level.

802
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:17,983
The footwork I think is the best of all 
time and now he's literally embracing 

803
00:33:21,561 --> 00:33:23,600
the whole idea of him being in the 
Matrix.

804
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,940
Has Matrix shorts on now.
See,

805
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,210
I like the matrix comparison.
I think of him as the nightcrawler.

806
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:29,721
Like,
you know,

807
00:33:29,721 --> 00:33:32,510
he's just teleporting around you.
He's just,

808
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:35,400
he just shows up suddenly right next to 
him.

809
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,520
Right.
He disappears and shows up right next to

810
00:33:37,521 --> 00:33:38,354
you in a different location there that,
that little movement and the 

811
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:44,510
anticipation of the counter and already 
been to three steps ahead of you.

812
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:46,750
That last fight against Sosa.
Yeah,

813
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,500
I saw that.
That was even better.

814
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,190
Even he improved.
He was even better.

815
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,680
I was like,
this is getting crazy.

816
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,990
Like it's so amazing.
Everyone should watch him.

817
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,513
He's,
he's on another level man on a complete 

818
00:33:57,261 --> 00:33:58,250
nother level.
So yeah,

819
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,680
for this,
a guy like him and kickboxing who?

820
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:01,543
Giorgio Petrosyan,
Georgia patrols and he's my best for 

821
00:34:04,191 --> 00:34:05,024
sure.
Yeah.

822
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,580
This is some next level shit too.
Definitely.

823
00:34:07,581 --> 00:34:08,510
Yeah,
I think so.

824
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:11,030
He did lose one fight by knockout a 
couple of years ago,

825
00:34:11,031 --> 00:34:11,864
but yeah.
Badly by Daniel Lee logos and rusty and 

826
00:34:16,061 --> 00:34:16,881
rusty,
that's what it was.

827
00:34:16,881 --> 00:34:17,714
Yeah.
Well risk is a brutal knockout punch or 

828
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:21,620
knocked out a van.
Rhys Millen to same year I think.

829
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:22,483
Well,
it's one of those things where a guy 

830
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:26,870
like any university has so much power.
If he catches a human being on the chin,

831
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:29,270
not perfect technique,
but men,

832
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,000
but nasty,
nasty power.

833
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:31,863
Yeah.
I wanted to talk about Jermaine to 

834
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,620
randomly.
Oh yeah.

835
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,550
Talking about her.
I mean,

836
00:34:34,551 --> 00:34:35,384
because,
uh,

837
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,530
it's funny that we're talking about 
fighting.

838
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:41,180
I'm so happy I want to do well.
This podcast really,

839
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,260
you know,
I don't know.

840
00:34:42,261 --> 00:34:46,990
It's not real format to it.
We've all noticed joe millions of us and

841
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,690
notice what is great about it.
Uh,

842
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:51,200
it wasn't going to say no.
I mean,

843
00:34:51,201 --> 00:34:51,770
I,
um,

844
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:52,603
it's funny.
I think the first time I was on here a 

845
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:54,224
couple of years ago,
I said at the end that I wanted to be a 

846
00:34:55,491 --> 00:34:56,780
surfer.
Deep Down,

847
00:34:56,781 --> 00:34:57,614
you know,
like I love what I do and being a 

848
00:34:58,701 --> 00:34:59,750
historian,
all this stuff.

849
00:34:59,751 --> 00:35:02,570
But deep down I wanted to be a surfer.
Now I don't want to be a surfer.

850
00:35:02,571 --> 00:35:04,490
I want to be a boxing coach.
Really?

851
00:35:04,491 --> 00:35:05,324
Yeah.
I really do.

852
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:10,640
A lot of people that are intellectuals,
a lot of people that live on almost like

853
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:13,550
a sedentary lifestyle because you're 
constantly in front of books or computer

854
00:35:13,551 --> 00:35:15,620
screens.
They long for this sense of adventure,

855
00:35:15,621 --> 00:35:19,880
I want to be a backpack or I want to go 
to Nepal and most most academics,

856
00:35:19,881 --> 00:35:20,714
and maybe this is one of the reasons I 
had to leave that profession or I'm 

857
00:35:24,171 --> 00:35:25,004
trying to leave that profession,
is that I've always been a physical 

858
00:35:26,841 --> 00:35:29,240
person to.
I've always been,

859
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:30,163
you know,
just in touch with my body in various 

860
00:35:31,161 --> 00:35:32,420
ways.
I've always been into sports,

861
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:34,870
playing them and doing stuff.
I just,

862
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,833
you know,
and most academics I'd say or least a 

863
00:35:37,321 --> 00:35:38,310
lot of them seem

864
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:40,020
to be completely cut off from their 
bodies.

865
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,300
They just don't care what's below the 
neck.

866
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,070
Uh,
they don't care what they wear,

867
00:35:44,071 --> 00:35:45,770
they don't care how they feel.
They certainly don't care.

868
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:48,960
They look many of them and they don't 
talk about the body.

869
00:35:48,961 --> 00:35:51,210
They don't talk about things like this 
ever.

870
00:35:51,211 --> 00:35:54,750
And in full they looked down on it.
The problem is the looking down on it.

871
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:55,643
I think that's very shortly this 
conversation right now we had about 

872
00:35:57,271 --> 00:35:58,104
boxing.
If you just took that clip that last 10 

873
00:35:59,101 --> 00:36:02,340
minutes and you put that in front of and
you sent that to every historian and the

874
00:36:02,341 --> 00:36:03,174
country,
I mean,

875
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,100
my reputation will be done.
I mean,

876
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:07,500
it's already pretty much done yet.
Are you serious?

877
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,050
Are you serious?
I appreciate box.

878
00:36:10,051 --> 00:36:12,180
I love talking to people who aren't from
that world.

879
00:36:12,181 --> 00:36:13,470
When I tell them about these things and 
they're like,

880
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:14,340
oh,
of course that couldn't be.

881
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:15,720
It's not that bad.
Well,

882
00:36:15,721 --> 00:36:18,310
what a silly world that is.
Then it's bad.

883
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,040
They would think less of me.
Well,

884
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,120
um,
but yeah,

885
00:36:21,121 --> 00:36:22,380
no,
I want to be a boxing coach.

886
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,430
I'm not,
I definitely.

887
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:24,280
Yeah.
Yeah.

888
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,970
I mean I don't know if I can really make
it happen professionally,

889
00:36:26,971 --> 00:36:29,040
but you know,
at least on the side,

890
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:31,050
you know,
we'd have to have a couple fights.

891
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,610
So anything.
That's what I'm wondering.

892
00:36:32,611 --> 00:36:33,181
I don't know.
I mean,

893
00:36:33,181 --> 00:36:37,500
I certainly can't coach pros,
but I mean I'm talking about people sort

894
00:36:37,501 --> 00:36:40,470
of like at my levels,
people who spar maybe,

895
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,510
maybe some amateur fighters.
I mean,

896
00:36:42,511 --> 00:36:43,344
I'm working like a little bit with a guy
in my gym who's trying to be an amateur 

897
00:36:45,211 --> 00:36:47,070
boxer now,
but I'm not his coach.

898
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:47,904
I'm just saying I'm sort of like trying 
to see because he's brand new to this 

899
00:36:50,011 --> 00:36:50,980
point.
Um,

900
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,350
and I just love it.

901
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,400
I love it.
I love teaching,

902
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,413
I love teaching and that's the thing 
about academia that have always just 

903
00:36:56,071 --> 00:36:56,904
loved.
And that's why I entered it because I 

904
00:36:58,081 --> 00:36:58,914
just felt like I was,
it was just natural for me teaching 

905
00:37:01,201 --> 00:37:02,820
people things.
Teaching is fun,

906
00:37:02,821 --> 00:37:03,720
man.
If you're good at it,

907
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:05,550
but most people are not.
Yeah.

908
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:07,200
Right.
So when you teach Jujitsu,

909
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,063
right?
I mean,

910
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,380
what you're doing is,
and this goes for anything.

911
00:37:10,381 --> 00:37:11,880
If you're teaching how to fix a bike,
right?

912
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,733
You take,
you're taking all these complex ideas 

913
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:14,814
and this is what you're a master at a.
You take all these really complex ideas 

914
00:37:17,461 --> 00:37:19,170
and you package them,
you,

915
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,800
you break them down into little bite 
sized components and then hand them over

916
00:37:22,801 --> 00:37:23,634
to the person,
right?

917
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,473
You give them so that they can consume 
it and understand it instead of just 

918
00:37:27,061 --> 00:37:27,710
saying,
oh,

919
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:28,620
that's the Japanese necktie.

920
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:29,670
Go ahead do it.
Right.

921
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,410
Which is what you'll see a lot of 
teachers do.

922
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,210
Here's how.
Here's how you do a Japanese necktie.

923
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,550
Now go ahead and do it right.
You're like,

924
00:37:35,551 --> 00:37:35,950
okay,
no,

925
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:36,783
the elbow goes here.
I mean a lot of Jujitsu instructors do 

926
00:37:39,031 --> 00:37:39,661
this too,
of course.

927
00:37:39,661 --> 00:37:41,580
But like you know,
the elbow goes right here,

928
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,670
an inch down there and then the knees 
here and then.

929
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,900
Right and so it's.
But it's just like what I do,

930
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:46,763
I mean,
you take these really complex abstract 

931
00:37:48,091 --> 00:37:48,924
concepts,
you know that and you give them back to 

932
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,980
two people who are completely new to 
them.

933
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,410
You have to,
you have to package it.

934
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,570
Not,
not dumb it down,

935
00:37:57,571 --> 00:38:00,520
but distill it right?
You have to like bring the,

936
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:04,350
the essential components down and get 
rid of all the extraneous stuff and then

937
00:38:04,351 --> 00:38:06,450
just hand it over to them and this is a 
very clear,

938
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,310
simple way.
And then you can give them,

939
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,233
give them the next part and then you 
connect that and then you connect that 

940
00:38:11,551 --> 00:38:12,384
and next thing you know,
they have this new radical concept of 

941
00:38:15,541 --> 00:38:18,030
Martin Luther King or they can do a 
Japanese necktie.

942
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,753
That's what separates someone who's a 
really good teacher versus someone who 

943
00:38:23,641 --> 00:38:27,410
has maybe some real skill at something 
but isn't good at communicating here.

944
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:32,280
Like breaking it down into a system,
like a step by step progression system.

945
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,890
Yeah.
My coach I was talking about in Salem,

946
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:35,970
Nick Gelardi,
I've got

947
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,300
to give them a shout out because he's 
awesome.

948
00:38:37,301 --> 00:38:38,770
He's one of the best.
What's that?

949
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,270
I said powerful nick.
Yeah,

950
00:38:40,271 --> 00:38:41,460
he is.
Yeah,

951
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:42,580
he is.
He,

952
00:38:42,581 --> 00:38:43,414
um,
he's one of the best coaches I've ever 

953
00:38:44,681 --> 00:38:46,720
seen because he,
he's really a coach's coach.

954
00:38:46,721 --> 00:38:48,220
Like he really cares about coaching and 
teaching.

955
00:38:48,221 --> 00:38:49,660
He really cares about teaching.
And that's what he does.

956
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:50,520
I could stop.
He'll.

957
00:38:50,521 --> 00:38:52,730
So he said he was at team quest guy.
He comes down.

958
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:56,290
So Robert Follis,
who is also an awesome coach who know he

959
00:38:56,291 --> 00:38:58,270
was,
he started out with them and now he's a,

960
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,620
he's extreme coture now.
Yeah,

961
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,530
he's worked with a lot of like top level
guys,

962
00:39:02,531 --> 00:39:03,364
but yeah,
I mean that's when the sport was being 

963
00:39:05,081 --> 00:39:06,060
invented by.
Sure.

964
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:06,963
Yeah,
so he was at the beginning of that as a 

965
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:10,300
kid with Dan Henderson,
Matt Lindland,

966
00:39:10,301 --> 00:39:11,700
you know,
randy coture,

967
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:15,190
but I think it's just that I don't think
it's about his context.

968
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:17,350
I think it's about who he is as a person
just like me.

969
00:39:17,351 --> 00:39:19,300
It's like it's not.
No one trained me to be a teacher.

970
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:21,160
Like when I was in,
when I was taking,

971
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:24,100
when I entered college,
I had no idea was going to be a teacher,

972
00:39:24,101 --> 00:39:24,934
but I remember sitting in his college 
classes that kind of weren't very good 

973
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:31,750
and I remember that I'd spent a lot of 
my time thinking about how I would teach

974
00:39:31,751 --> 00:39:33,520
this differently than this guy was 
teaching it.

975
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,740
And then I realized,
oh wait,

976
00:39:35,741 --> 00:39:36,570
I just,
I,

977
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:40,720
I'm actually studying the teaching more 
than the subject itself,

978
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:41,853
how to communicate these ideas.
I was studying more than the subject 

979
00:39:44,021 --> 00:39:46,480
itself and then I just do.
It dawned on me finally.

980
00:39:46,481 --> 00:39:46,871
I was like,
oh,

981
00:39:46,871 --> 00:39:48,850
well that means you probably should be a
teacher.

982
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:52,000
And when I finally started doing it in 
graduate school at Columbia,

983
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,130
I was teaching,
you know,

984
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,640
philosophy actually.

985
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,290
And yeah,
I just,

986
00:39:56,291 --> 00:39:57,970
I loved it.
It was just my passion.

987
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,833
Do you find that?
Will is you teach things that it helps 

988
00:40:00,641 --> 00:40:04,630
you better understand them too because 
you go over them from a real fundamental

989
00:40:04,631 --> 00:40:05,740
perspective?
Precisely.

990
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:06,671
Precisely.
Right,

991
00:40:06,671 --> 00:40:07,504
so you don't.
And that was the first thing I learned 

992
00:40:08,981 --> 00:40:12,370
when I started teaching was that I 
thought I knew plato really well,

993
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:13,720
you know,
until I started,

994
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:17,350
until I knew that I had to teach him the
next day and I was like,

995
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,190
oh,
wait a minute.

996
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:21,490
I didn't quite actually get that 
connection there between those two ideas

997
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,360
in his book,
you know?

998
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,830
Yeah.
You have to.

999
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,930
I tell my students this all the time.
I said,

1000
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,033
you need to be as comfortable,
so comfortable with this text that you 

1001
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:32,170
can teach it to your roommate who's 
never read it before.

1002
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,660
That means what that means is you have 
to think all the way through the ideas.

1003
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:38,643
You have to go all with your mind all 
the way through the ideas and then come 

1004
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,840
back through them.
Right.

1005
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:46,250
It's just like it's like martial arts or
anything else,

1006
00:40:46,251 --> 00:40:47,084
like you have to actually do the 
Japanese neck necktie all the way 

1007
00:40:49,241 --> 00:40:53,770
through and come back all the way 
through it and then you can teach it all

1008
00:40:53,771 --> 00:40:56,860
the way through taekwondo career I 
taught.

1009
00:40:56,890 --> 00:41:00,160
I taught at Boston University.
I taught my own school.

1010
00:41:00,161 --> 00:41:02,310
I taught classes.
I taught the entire time.

1011
00:41:02,311 --> 00:41:03,580
It's one other way.
I made a living.

1012
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:06,190
I didn't know that and it helped me 
tremendously.

1013
00:41:06,191 --> 00:41:07,024
It helped me understand it and I didn't 
realize how much it helped me until I 

1014
00:41:09,821 --> 00:41:10,654
started doing Jujitsu and I watched 
other people who started teaching 

1015
00:41:13,901 --> 00:41:18,640
Jujitsu just jump ahead by leaps and 
bounds from where they were.

1016
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:19,863
A good example is my friend Brent,
he was a like a purple belt and he was 

1017
00:41:23,801 --> 00:41:24,634
always like a certain level,
kind of a static level and then not 

1018
00:41:28,271 --> 00:41:29,860
static,
but you know improving,

1019
00:41:29,861 --> 00:41:31,120
but nothing crazy.

1020
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,410
It was like everybody else.
Right.

1021
00:41:32,411 --> 00:41:33,290
What?
Jujitsu is hard.

1022
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:35,780
It takes a long time to get better and 
you're around other people that are also

1023
00:41:35,781 --> 00:41:38,150
getting better,
so it's hard to look really measure,

1024
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:39,223
you know,
but then he started teaching and 

1025
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:43,243
teaching full time and then all the 
sudden I would roll with him and I'd be 

1026
00:41:46,011 --> 00:41:49,850
in great danger and I be like,
Jesus and I had a conversation with them

1027
00:41:49,851 --> 00:41:51,530
once,
after a training with them,

1028
00:41:51,531 --> 00:41:52,364
like,
dude,

1029
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,400
I don't know what the fuck you're doing,
but your,

1030
00:41:54,401 --> 00:41:57,080
your game has jumped like four or five 
steps ahead.

1031
00:41:57,110 --> 00:42:00,080
Like I feel like I'm the same as I was 
six,

1032
00:42:00,081 --> 00:42:00,914
seven months ago.
And he was like years ahead and he said 

1033
00:42:03,471 --> 00:42:04,610
it was all just teaching.
And,

1034
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:08,630
and I remember now that that was the 
first time I really felt confident as an

1035
00:42:08,631 --> 00:42:09,720
intellectual,
you know,

1036
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:12,530
as when you were teaching the subjects 
at once I had taught them,

1037
00:42:12,531 --> 00:42:13,041
it was like,
oh,

1038
00:42:13,041 --> 00:42:13,874
now I actually feel I was always.
I mean everybody's wracked with 

1039
00:42:15,711 --> 00:42:18,320
insecurity and especially in graduate 
school about these things.

1040
00:42:18,321 --> 00:42:20,720
You know,
everybody feels like an imposter because

1041
00:42:20,721 --> 00:42:21,554
we all,
there's all,

1042
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,510
all of us have,
you know,

1043
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,353
500 bucks that everyone else has read 
that you should have read that we 

1044
00:42:25,401 --> 00:42:26,234
haven't read.

1045
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:29,083
And I came from this little dip shit 
college in Ohio and I was like a c 

1046
00:42:32,391 --> 00:42:34,790
student in high school,
so I had an extra insecurity,

1047
00:42:34,791 --> 00:42:37,640
but once I started teaching it and 
forcing myself to,

1048
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:40,250
as you said,
like learn the thing all the way through

1049
00:42:40,251 --> 00:42:42,410
it and master it and then teaching it,
that's when I felt,

1050
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:43,730
oh yeah,
I belong here.

1051
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:44,623
I get it.
I really do have some solid 

1052
00:42:47,091 --> 00:42:50,810
understanding of plato now and I really,
I really can do this thing.

1053
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,640
You know,
it's interesting that you're saying that

1054
00:42:52,641 --> 00:42:54,880
because that's a big issue with 
comedians too.

1055
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,960
And like as they're becoming successful,
especially they feel like frauds.

1056
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:03,170
Like everybody I know says that I've 
said it.

1057
00:43:03,171 --> 00:43:04,004
Everybody I know that's sort of like 
started to make it like as they're 

1058
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:11,270
starting to headline and go on the road 
places and do television sets and things

1059
00:43:11,271 --> 00:43:11,770
along those lines.

1060
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:13,880
Do you feel like a fraud when you're 
successful?

1061
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:15,090
Yes,
I feel like a fraud.

1062
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:15,980
You like,
I'm,

1063
00:43:15,981 --> 00:43:18,080
you know,
because you'll look at yourself and then

1064
00:43:18,081 --> 00:43:19,320
you'll look at,
you know,

1065
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:22,100
a Dave Chappelle or someone else,
Chris Rock and you're like,

1066
00:43:22,101 --> 00:43:23,420
well,
I'm a fucking fraud.

1067
00:43:23,421 --> 00:43:24,860
I'm a fraud.
I'm not that guy.

1068
00:43:24,861 --> 00:43:25,850
I'm a fraud.
I'm not Richard,

1069
00:43:25,851 --> 00:43:27,200
Jenny,
I'm a fraud.

1070
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,393
And then I'm sure it takes a long time 
before you feel comfortable enough to 

1071
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:34,580
say,
I know what I'm doing in academia.

1072
00:43:34,581 --> 00:43:37,070
It's called the Charlatans Syndrome,
right?

1073
00:43:37,071 --> 00:43:39,380
We all feel like we're charlatan.
I think it exists in everything.

1074
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,353
Everything difficult.
I'm not surprised and I think it's also 

1075
00:43:42,501 --> 00:43:44,360
probably a hallmark of someone who 
cares.

1076
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:45,733
Yeah,
absolutely.

1077
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:47,130
That's what makes you better.
Yeah.

1078
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:49,430
Yeah.
I don't think every academic has that,

1079
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:52,700
but I think those who do are the ones 
who were interesting and get better.

1080
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,393
I think the worst would be the opposite.
Someone who's like super confident way 

1081
00:43:57,501 --> 00:43:59,000
before their time.
Yeah,

1082
00:43:59,001 --> 00:43:59,800
that's what I mean.
Yeah.

1083
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,180
They're going to suck.
There's a lot of that too though,

1084
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,014
right?
Yeah.

1085
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:05,450
A lot of weirdness in academia,
man.

1086
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:06,403
No kidding.
I can't imagine the stuff that you guys 

1087
00:44:08,151 --> 00:44:09,920
go through politically.
Oh my God,

1088
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:10,913
because just you saying that you 
couldn't talk about boxing because you 

1089
00:44:13,761 --> 00:44:16,220
would be thought of as a fool.
So that's the thing.

1090
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:22,280
I know you're really interested in this 
and I am too and I'm the.

1091
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:25,400
There are some misconceptions and that.
Well,

1092
00:44:25,401 --> 00:44:29,120
I shouldn't say their misconceptions.
I would say that there's a distortion of

1093
00:44:29,121 --> 00:44:31,560
what's going on and this is not to say 
it's,

1094
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:32,070
it's

1095
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,290
actually to say that it's worse than you
think it is.

1096
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,633
So what most people who are outside of 
academia think is going on is not quite 

1097
00:44:39,541 --> 00:44:41,810
what's going on.
We think it's something worse.

1098
00:44:41,811 --> 00:44:42,880
Well,
I know because I've heard her do.

1099
00:44:42,881 --> 00:44:43,714
You have lots and lots of other people 
talk about and it's not your fault at 

1100
00:44:45,061 --> 00:44:47,520
all because you're not there and all you
do is get the media reports about it.

1101
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:48,833
So I think what most people,
I get it from Gad sad and Jordan 

1102
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,820
Peterson or professors,
they end day.

1103
00:44:53,821 --> 00:44:55,350
If you listen to them,
actually they will.

1104
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:56,243
They themselves.
We'll talk about it a little 

1105
00:44:56,851 --> 00:44:57,684
differently,
but people still consume it differently 

1106
00:44:58,651 --> 00:45:03,651
because the news right is all about the 
crazy thing that the 18 year old said at

1107
00:45:04,441 --> 00:45:06,810
Wesleyan or whatever,
or it's not the 18 year old.

1108
00:45:06,811 --> 00:45:09,870
It's the 45 year old sometimes the 45 
year old.

1109
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:10,531
Yeah.
Okay.

1110
00:45:10,531 --> 00:45:11,364
But here's the.
So that stuff that really sort of loony 

1111
00:45:14,281 --> 00:45:15,120
stuff,
you know,

1112
00:45:15,121 --> 00:45:18,630
that you hear coming out or protest,
you know,

1113
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:23,040
people saying that they are,
I'm going to die because you said a word

1114
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:25,650
that happens.
It does.

1115
00:45:25,651 --> 00:45:26,970
That's all true.
It's all there.

1116
00:45:26,971 --> 00:45:27,804
I've seen it,
but I've seen it maybe at most one time 

1117
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:35,580
a year in the colleges where I've been.
Maybe not even less than that.

1118
00:45:35,581 --> 00:45:37,830
Okay.
What is.

1119
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:40,830
And if it were just that,
that's not actually a big deal.

1120
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:41,933
It's much worse than that.
What's what's worse is that if there is 

1121
00:45:46,081 --> 00:45:51,081
a self censorship going on that's 
universal and profound,

1122
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:55,500
constant omnipresent.
Like for instance,

1123
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,513
you know,
I never talk about my love for boxing 

1124
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:01,800
around academics or I'm very careful if 
I do,

1125
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,560
but it's not even that.
It's that we know that there are certain

1126
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:07,860
things that can't be set on a college 
campus and so we just don't say them,

1127
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:11,130
therefore there's no need to police us.

1128
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:12,413
There's no need to yell at us and 
screaming us in protest and what's the 

1129
00:46:14,791 --> 00:46:19,350
motivation for the for which are the 
people that are holding back on thoughts

1130
00:46:19,351 --> 00:46:21,260
that maybe they would normally express.
Okay.

1131
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:24,810
Well here's what I think it is for the 
senior faculty who have tenure,

1132
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:27,570
meaning lifetime appointments,
cowardice.

1133
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:30,630
That's all it is.
I think they're cowards.

1134
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:31,523
Yeah.
If you are an adjunct like me with no 

1135
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:38,130
job security or if you're an assistant 
professor up for tenure and if you don't

1136
00:46:38,131 --> 00:46:39,510
get tenure,
you have no career.

1137
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,190
I don't blame them.
I get it.

1138
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:42,053
That's what I've done too.
I police myself because you have to to 

1139
00:46:43,921 --> 00:46:46,260
stay in the game.
If you have tenure,

1140
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:48,510
lifetime appointment,
you're a senior professor.

1141
00:46:48,511 --> 00:46:50,460
You make the decisions there on 
curriculum,

1142
00:46:50,461 --> 00:46:54,870
hiring and firing and tenure.
The faculty make those decisions and you

1143
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:58,620
don't challenge these crazy ideas in any
way.

1144
00:46:58,650 --> 00:46:59,483
Or if you police yourself,
you stop yourself from saying things 

1145
00:47:00,841 --> 00:47:03,150
that you think are right that you 
believe in.

1146
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:05,940
You're a coward.
I'm sorry.

1147
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:07,830
Those people are cowards.
I've seen it.

1148
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:10,320
It's just overrun by cowards.
Yeah,

1149
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:11,430
yeah,
yeah.

1150
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:12,240
No,
I mean this.

1151
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,430
They are very though.
So here's the thing.

1152
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:16,140
I can't prove this.
This is just,

1153
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:18,420
I'm just saying this is,
this is my belief,

1154
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:19,283
but I think it's pretty well informed 
because I've been around these people a 

1155
00:47:21,001 --> 00:47:23,880
long time and in part I share this,
the,

1156
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:24,773
I think the worst fear of all those 
people is being called a or a sexist 

1157
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:31,383
publicly.
I think that is their version of being 

1158
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:35,613
in a cave,
crawling on their bellies in the pitch 

1159
00:47:38,381 --> 00:47:39,880
black.
I think that's their worst.

1160
00:47:39,881 --> 00:47:44,380
Fear it and for not.
It's not entirely irrational,

1161
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:45,400
right?
You can,

1162
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,890
you know,
you will be publicly shamed.

1163
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:48,753
You will.
The whole campus will think you're a 

1164
00:47:49,631 --> 00:47:52,030
racist even if you're not.
Um,

1165
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,073
it might even make the media and then 
pump and then the whole world thinks 

1166
00:47:55,061 --> 00:47:56,230
you're a racist.
For a minute,

1167
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,500
but you're not going to lose your job if
you have tenure,

1168
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:00,680
you know,
a year,

1169
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:04,420
unless you actually did say it did say 
something that's truly racist.

1170
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:06,760
Um,
it's just cowardice.

1171
00:48:06,761 --> 00:48:09,280
I think that's what we need.
We need those professors,

1172
00:48:09,281 --> 00:48:10,114
the ones with the power and I'm talking 
about they have absolute power on these 

1173
00:48:12,011 --> 00:48:12,844
campuses,
right?

1174
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,520
These aren't even like politicians.
You have to go up for a vote.

1175
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:16,543
They,
they're there forever unless they 

1176
00:48:17,741 --> 00:48:19,450
basically killed somebody,
you know,

1177
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:21,093
they need to stand up now.
People like Jordan Peterson and I have 

1178
00:48:23,831 --> 00:48:28,831
major differences with him on sort of 
the content of his ideas.

1179
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:31,150
Uh,
not about academia but on academia.

1180
00:48:31,151 --> 00:48:33,850
He's right completely and I'm totally in
solidarity with him,

1181
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:35,770
what they did to him and what they're 
doing to him.

1182
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:40,150
Uh,
we need more people like him standing up

1183
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:42,190
and saying,
no,

1184
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:47,310
I'm going to say what I want in my 
classrooms and on twitter and in because

1185
00:48:48,281 --> 00:48:50,170
that's.
People have been punished for that too.

1186
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:52,900
Was it trying to get him to stop doing 
is youtube black rhino,

1187
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:55,960
which is fascinating because they're 
very measured.

1188
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:56,823
Their long form.
He gets to expand on his thoughts as 

1189
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:00,910
much as he likes.
He's very,

1190
00:49:00,911 --> 00:49:03,740
very informed.
I again,

1191
00:49:03,741 --> 00:49:05,730
I,
I have major disagree.

1192
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:06,673
What is the disagreement?
Disagreements with him on gender and 

1193
00:49:10,811 --> 00:49:13,030
postmodernism.
I think he's completely off,

1194
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:16,300
but you know how solid and so,
so he,

1195
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,580
and I know you agree with him on this.
I think,

1196
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:19,473
well maybe,
I don't know.

1197
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:20,860
I'm not sure,
but you know,

1198
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:23,560
it's this idea that there just are two 
genders.

1199
00:49:23,561 --> 00:49:26,030
That's it.
And they're good.

1200
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,610
Okay.
He seems to think that I'm.

1201
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:29,973
So.
I think there's a spectrum of humans in 

1202
00:49:31,421 --> 00:49:34,120
every single aspect of being a person I 
should say.

1203
00:49:34,121 --> 00:49:35,890
I heard your conversation with them and 
I could see,

1204
00:49:35,891 --> 00:49:37,750
and this was interesting,
it was exciting because I could actually

1205
00:49:37,751 --> 00:49:38,584
see you moving in a direction that I 
found to be much more interesting than 

1206
00:49:40,931 --> 00:49:42,850
his,
which is closer to mine,

1207
00:49:42,851 --> 00:49:43,720
which is,
yeah,

1208
00:49:43,721 --> 00:49:44,351
that it.
This,

1209
00:49:44,351 --> 00:49:47,210
it's fluid feminine men.
There's masculine women there.

1210
00:49:47,211 --> 00:49:49,150
Thailand,
Thailand,

1211
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:50,141
in fact.
Speeding.

1212
00:49:50,141 --> 00:49:52,000
Here we go.
Merging all these topics together.

1213
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:56,560
One of the top Moitai fighters recently,
I don't know if she's still fighting,

1214
00:49:56,561 --> 00:49:59,410
is a ladyboy in Thailand.
Well,

1215
00:49:59,411 --> 00:50:01,480
once she became,
once you got the operation,

1216
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:03,420
her performance dropped off pretty 
radical.

1217
00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:07,510
Sure.
But that's just the lack of a Felon Fox,

1218
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:09,520
so I agree with you there.
So here's the thing.

1219
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:10,780
Okay.
That's a different story.

1220
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:13,360
I totally agree with you on that 
particular thing.

1221
00:50:13,361 --> 00:50:14,194
Right?
Whether she should have been allowed to 

1222
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:16,420
fight.
Well,

1223
00:50:16,421 --> 00:50:18,280
it's not that she should have been 
allowed to fight.

1224
00:50:18,281 --> 00:50:22,390
I think she should be allowed to fight 
women as long as the women know that she

1225
00:50:22,391 --> 00:50:23,430
used to be a man.
That's fine.

1226
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:25,330
Tim was,
for the first two fights,

1227
00:50:25,331 --> 00:50:28,520
she didn't disclose it because she said 
it was a medical procedure

1228
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,353
and she didn't have to give up the 
personal details of her medical 

1229
00:50:31,191 --> 00:50:32,150
procedure.
I say,

1230
00:50:32,151 --> 00:50:33,150
that's bullshit,
right?

1231
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:33,741
I say,
well,

1232
00:50:33,741 --> 00:50:34,574
you're dealing with a chromosomal issue.
You're dealing with the fact that you 

1233
00:50:36,681 --> 00:50:38,130
have a different bone structure.
Yes.

1234
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:42,310
Different mechanical advantages and 30 
years of testosterone in your body.

1235
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:43,850
It's just not the same.
Exactly,

1236
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:46,370
but as long as someone knows.
Look,

1237
00:50:46,371 --> 00:50:48,590
I'm fine with drained Germain de 
Randamie.

1238
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:50,620
She knocked out a man.
I don't know if you ever saw this,

1239
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:52,350
but she's.
She's just,

1240
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:56,750
she's not choose to fucking bad ass.
Fucking bad ass.

1241
00:50:57,010 --> 00:50:59,210
I mean,
I don't know if she's taking anything in

1242
00:50:59,211 --> 00:51:01,610
her entire career.
It would just be pure speculation.

1243
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:03,830
She doesn't look like she has.
That doesn't mean anything either.

1244
00:51:03,850 --> 00:51:04,370
Right?
Right.

1245
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:08,330
But she's so fucking bad ass and so 
tactical and so tough.

1246
00:51:08,350 --> 00:51:11,750
I know she's fought men,
but she knew there were a man going in.

1247
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:12,583
She made a decision just like,
I think you should be allowed to sky 

1248
00:51:14,261 --> 00:51:15,094
dive,
just like I think you should be allowed 

1249
00:51:15,891 --> 00:51:17,720
to ride bulls.
I don't think it's smart,

1250
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:19,640
but you should be able to do whatever 
the fuck you want to do.

1251
00:51:19,641 --> 00:51:20,474
I'm all for freedom of expression of 
participation in any sort of dangerous 

1252
00:51:24,471 --> 00:51:25,304
activity.
My issue 100 percent was that people 

1253
00:51:27,721 --> 00:51:31,790
were trying to pretend that there's no 
advantage whatsoever and that's crazy.

1254
00:51:31,791 --> 00:51:33,710
That's silly.
So the thing is what they're.

1255
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:38,660
So within that framework,
within the rules we are operating in,

1256
00:51:38,661 --> 00:51:41,060
right?
Whether it's in fighting or whether it's

1257
00:51:41,061 --> 00:51:45,860
in this particular society and wrestling
girl and read all about that too.

1258
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:46,461
Right?
Exactly.

1259
00:51:46,461 --> 00:51:48,250
So those are,
that's a particular route you're,

1260
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:50,540
you are agreeing to play a particular 
game,

1261
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:51,530
right?
Right.

1262
00:51:51,530 --> 00:51:53,690
And you're just breaking the rules.
That's all.

1263
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:56,870
I mean you have,
you have soil body.

1264
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:59,150
Well they're letting them break the 
rules.

1265
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:00,163
The rules are not and I think a lot of 
it is people worried about being called 

1266
00:52:03,051 --> 00:52:08,051
transphobic or homophobic or in any way 
prejudice where they're allowing certain

1267
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:11,630
people to compete in these.
Like this woman in Australia,

1268
00:52:11,631 --> 00:52:12,464
the Trans Woman in Australia that just 
broke all these world records in 

1269
00:52:14,751 --> 00:52:15,584
weightlifting because she was a fucking 
man or a whole life and all of a sudden 

1270
00:52:18,201 --> 00:52:20,040
became a woman.
It's just killing everybody.

1271
00:52:20,041 --> 00:52:20,874
And then there's the lifting,
the runners and I think they're from 

1272
00:52:22,881 --> 00:52:24,260
Kenya or South Africa.
No,

1273
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:26,060
the one from South Africa to color.
I forget her name,

1274
00:52:26,061 --> 00:52:26,894
but what do you mean?
The one that's like a Hermaphrodite who 

1275
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:30,050
will.
I don't know what she is,

1276
00:52:30,051 --> 00:52:32,480
but she's broken every record by like,
you know,

1277
00:52:32,481 --> 00:52:33,314
huge insane amounts and thinks she's 
just a woman with an abnormally large 

1278
00:52:37,731 --> 00:52:38,660
amount of testosterone.

1279
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:40,490
I think they've actually done 
chromosomal tests.

1280
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,020
I don't know,
when I saw her in the Olympics,

1281
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:45,680
I just jumped out at me.
I just pulled that up because I'm pretty

1282
00:52:45,681 --> 00:52:46,514
sure that that woman actually has been 
tested and then there was a real issue 

1283
00:52:49,701 --> 00:52:50,534
behind it and she felt terrible about it
because it was just the way she was 

1284
00:52:52,401 --> 00:52:53,270
born.
Really?

1285
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:53,961
Yeah.
Yeah.

1286
00:52:53,961 --> 00:52:54,800
Well,
again,

1287
00:52:54,801 --> 00:52:55,750
a spectrum.
Yeah,

1288
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:56,690
I cooked.
There's men.

1289
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:59,000
What a tremendous amounts of 
testosterone.

1290
00:52:59,001 --> 00:52:59,834
There's men that have like almost none.
That's actually the major point we need 

1291
00:53:02,031 --> 00:53:03,800
to talk about.
You're totally on the right track there.

1292
00:53:03,801 --> 00:53:06,020
I totally agree with that.
That's the most important thing,

1293
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:07,580
which is that there's a spectrum,
right?

1294
00:53:07,581 --> 00:53:08,414
And so to say that there are that 50 
percent of the world is male and 50 

1295
00:53:13,191 --> 00:53:16,650
percent is female nonsense or men and 
men are right.

1296
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:18,590
That's say,
I say to my students,

1297
00:53:18,591 --> 00:53:19,424
I say,
okay,

1298
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,290
there's 7 billion people in the world.
Okay.

1299
00:53:21,291 --> 00:53:23,210
Imagine in your mind lining all of them 
up,

1300
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,890
you know,
naked in front of you.

1301
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,010
How many sections do

1302
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:26,880
you see?
Right?

1303
00:53:26,881 --> 00:53:27,714
This is what I want you to do is get a 
picture of Yoel Romero and put it next 

1304
00:53:30,571 --> 00:53:33,930
to a picture of Andy Dick.
Tell me they're the same thing.

1305
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:37,290
Telling me this is even.
They're both men.

1306
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,450
Tell me it's even.
It's nonsense.

1307
00:53:40,370 --> 00:53:42,030
I mean,
right.

1308
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:43,130
It's chaos.
I've,

1309
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:43,861
you know,
it's like,

1310
00:53:43,861 --> 00:53:45,150
have you ever heard a guy on the 
streets?

1311
00:53:45,151 --> 00:53:45,421
They,
man,

1312
00:53:45,421 --> 00:53:46,660
that's a lot of woman.
Yes.

1313
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:49,800
Well that suggests there are women who 
are less women to them.

1314
00:53:50,490 --> 00:53:51,630
Exactly.
Yeah,

1315
00:53:51,631 --> 00:53:52,464
that's exactly right.
There's a spectrum and spectrum and 

1316
00:53:54,271 --> 00:53:56,040
sizes mean.
That's what I was to ask you this.

1317
00:53:56,041 --> 00:53:57,240
Okay.
So let's push a little further.

1318
00:53:57,241 --> 00:53:57,661
Okay,
so,

1319
00:53:57,661 --> 00:54:00,610
so far you're doing very well in your 
eyes.

1320
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,600
Some people are screaming at their 
fucking computer.

1321
00:54:03,601 --> 00:54:04,500
Believe me.
I know.

1322
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,390
Believe me.
I know.

1323
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:09,840
I'm going almost.
So that's.

1324
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:10,531
Well,
no,

1325
00:54:10,531 --> 00:54:11,460
I think you already are.

1326
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:13,440
I think you already went all the way 
actually.

1327
00:54:13,441 --> 00:54:14,380
I mean,
so what?

1328
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:16,380
There's two things.
There's,

1329
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:20,760
there's the Jordan Peterson view.
Hang on,

1330
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:22,440
let me,
let me put it out there and let me.

1331
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,210
Okay.
What I think is he saying,

1332
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:29,660
which is that gender is fixed and 
biologically determined.

1333
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,090
I'm pretty sure he does believe that.
Okay.

1334
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:36,420
That's what I would call sort of the 
traditional conservative.

1335
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:39,060
Conventional.
Those both men.

1336
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:40,013
Yeah,
exactly.

1337
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:45,270
Or you know what or like there's more 
than two categories in the world.

1338
00:54:45,271 --> 00:54:47,460
Right.
And so Andy Dick would be one.

1339
00:54:47,461 --> 00:54:48,294
And where would you put me there mean 
neither one of those guys are in the 

1340
00:54:52,951 --> 00:54:53,820
middle there.
I'm neither.

1341
00:54:53,821 --> 00:54:58,821
One of them you will see the deal is 
both of them can procreate with women.

1342
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:01,853
They'll both met but,
but whole lot of tech people who are 

1343
00:55:04,981 --> 00:55:08,190
called men cannot procreate with women a
whole lot.

1344
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:10,260
What do you mean?
They've been trans women.

1345
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:12,000
Trans men live.
They can't.

1346
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:13,440
It doesn't work.
Oh,

1347
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:16,890
so they don't develop sperm or Sophia?
Of course.

1348
00:55:16,891 --> 00:55:18,480
I really common.
Yeah.

1349
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,420
Once you tested when you were trying to 
get pregnant?

1350
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:22,980
No,
I just knocked her up.

1351
00:55:22,981 --> 00:55:23,814
Dude.
Come on.

1352
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:25,880
Maybe I wasn't.
But anyway,

1353
00:55:26,330 --> 00:55:28,830
it certainly wasn't in there.
And watch the fireworks.

1354
00:55:28,831 --> 00:55:30,390
Yeah,
see,

1355
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:31,253
there you go.
So you're more of a man you've just 

1356
00:55:32,911 --> 00:55:34,530
proven yet again.
He goes,

1357
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:35,550
the woman,
yeah,

1358
00:55:35,551 --> 00:55:36,610
Jesus Christ.
When you.

1359
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:38,080
Yeah.
That's not a great picture.

1360
00:55:38,081 --> 00:55:43,081
It doesn't give you a sense of how it 
look at the thighs and the bolts bulge.

1361
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:45,720
Well,
three times as high as most women.

1362
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:46,411
Whoa,
okay.

1363
00:55:46,411 --> 00:55:50,160
So reports leaked out.
That doesn't really mean anything.

1364
00:55:50,161 --> 00:55:51,990
I don't think she's ever really been 
tested.

1365
00:55:51,991 --> 00:55:54,270
I believe she has.
See if she's been tested.

1366
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:57,470
What does the test set,
but it leaked.

1367
00:55:57,510 --> 00:55:58,343
She was subjected to sex verification 
test after she won the world 

1368
00:56:00,811 --> 00:56:02,910
championships in Germany.
And what does it say?

1369
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:07,650
Yellow results.
We're supposed to be confidential,

1370
00:56:07,651 --> 00:56:08,484
but reports leaked out that she had 
testosterone levels three times as high 

1371
00:56:10,861 --> 00:56:12,930
as most women.
Other intimate details,

1372
00:56:12,931 --> 00:56:13,764
better anatomy were also reported.
A Somalia became targeted Semenya 

1373
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:22,320
Semenya how brutal your first name is.
The purse party named his semen.

1374
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:24,173
Seaman

1375
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:27,790
became targeted with abuse on social 
media,

1376
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,410
but what does it say?
This is.

1377
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,273
So is it saying that she's a 
hermaphrodite because they were talking 

1378
00:56:31,541 --> 00:56:31,620
to

1379
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:34,200
about her.
This is the clitoral size me.

1380
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:35,063
It's the equivalent of pretty much every
article written about trump by the New 

1381
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:39,390
York Times.
Well,

1382
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:40,223
you know,
a,

1383
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:42,510
a,
a report was leaked by,

1384
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:44,790
you know,
senior officials said,

1385
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:47,940
where's the actual evidence of any of 
this stuff?

1386
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:49,100
I don't see it.
Yeah.

1387
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:50,640
What does it,
it doesn't say anything.

1388
00:56:50,641 --> 00:56:52,470
So she passed the test.
Doesn't matter.

1389
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,300
He must have passed the test.
Doesn't matter.

1390
00:56:54,510 --> 00:56:57,350
Here's the thing.
I think if I recall,

1391
00:56:57,390 --> 00:56:59,760
if I were a woman athlete,
right?

1392
00:56:59,970 --> 00:57:01,090
Yeah.
Um,

1393
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:04,930
I would want rules established.
Um,

1394
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:10,670
it's like I would want rules established
defining the physical characteristics of

1395
00:57:11,521 --> 00:57:13,920
any of my potential opponents.
Right?

1396
00:57:13,950 --> 00:57:18,690
So it could be whatever bone density,
muscle mass,

1397
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:20,610
you know,
testosterone levels,

1398
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:21,211
you name it,
you,

1399
00:57:21,211 --> 00:57:22,044
you,
you could probably speak to this better 

1400
00:57:22,531 --> 00:57:23,364
than I could,
but I'm sure there's all sorts of ways 

1401
00:57:24,181 --> 00:57:26,970
you could actually define that pretty 
precisely.

1402
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:28,710
And you can test those things and you 
can say,

1403
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:29,850
okay,
you get to be in this.

1404
00:57:29,970 --> 00:57:32,580
It's like weight classes and fighting.
It's no different really.

1405
00:57:32,581 --> 00:57:33,414
Right.
I mean,

1406
00:57:33,870 --> 00:57:38,340
you're not allowed to fight someone 
who's 30 pounds lighter than you are.

1407
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:40,710
And so you could do that in any sport,
you could say,

1408
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:41,933
right.
If you're above a certain height or 

1409
00:57:42,991 --> 00:57:45,210
above a certain weight or have this much
muscle,

1410
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:48,270
are that much testosterone,
you're not allowed in this category.

1411
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,520
There's nothing wrong with that.
There's nothing sexist about that.

1412
00:57:50,521 --> 00:57:53,840
There's nothing anti-trans about that.
It's just a different candidate,

1413
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:55,170
but that's all that matters,
right?

1414
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:58,710
That if that is the problem was that 
Fallon Fox had,

1415
00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:00,450
as you said,
more muscle,

1416
00:58:00,451 --> 00:58:01,284
more testosterone,
all these physical characteristics that 

1417
00:58:03,751 --> 00:58:04,584
were fundamentally different than all of
the other women fighting in that 

1418
00:58:07,441 --> 00:58:09,270
category.
In that particular game.

1419
00:58:09,870 --> 00:58:10,900
That's all you gotta do.

1420
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:14,950
Problem is that you can do damage to the
person and it's not as simple as playing

1421
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:17,090
basketball against someone who had more 
testosterone.

1422
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:18,003
It's terrible to do that.
There's also like there's a type of 

1423
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:24,110
thinking that's involved in discussing 
this were the you.

1424
00:58:24,111 --> 00:58:27,680
You have to follow a line of thinking.
If you don't follow line,

1425
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:30,550
thank you're transphobic.
You're a hateful person,

1426
00:58:30,551 --> 00:58:33,700
you're a bigot,
and that line of thinking is not science

1427
00:58:33,701 --> 00:58:34,840
based.
It's just not.

1428
00:58:34,841 --> 00:58:35,674
When you.
When you talk to board certified 

1429
00:58:37,301 --> 00:58:39,640
endocrinologist,
do they talk about Trans People?

1430
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:43,360
One of the things that they talk about 
is the fact that when you take estrogen,

1431
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:44,403
it actually maintains bone densities,
the reason why they give estrogen to 

1432
00:58:47,351 --> 00:58:48,184
women who have osteoporosis,
so this idea that your bone density 

1433
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:54,160
decreases when you go from being a man 
to a woman.

1434
00:58:54,161 --> 00:58:56,620
It's bullshit.
You're taking testosterone.

1435
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:00,070
Your bone density is going to stay the 
same or get thicker,

1436
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:01,053
but if you're taking estrogen,
your bone density is also going to 

1437
00:59:04,481 --> 00:59:05,314
maintain.
It's going to help you maintain so when 

1438
00:59:07,481 --> 00:59:10,420
you remove the body's ability to produce
testosterone its own.

1439
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:15,960
There was a whole article and I'm bloody
elbow of MMA by this board,

1440
00:59:16,361 --> 00:59:17,194
certified endocrinologist,
Dr Ramona sick and which she did 

1441
00:59:20,741 --> 00:59:22,040
different than everything else.

1442
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:26,930
All these other articles is.
She's not a gender reassignment surgeon,

1443
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:27,973
okay?
All these other people that are 

1444
00:59:28,821 --> 00:59:33,710
commenting on this have a vested 
interest in it being completely neutral.

1445
00:59:33,830 --> 00:59:34,663
There's all these people that are trans 
people that are commenting on it and 

1446
00:59:36,981 --> 00:59:37,814
they're doing it from a very biased 
perspective because we're not talking 

1447
00:59:40,431 --> 00:59:44,510
about mountain biking,
which there was a woman who used to be a

1448
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:47,930
man who dominated mountain biking and it
became a giant issue with people.

1449
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:51,650
They first supported her and then she 
was winning by such enormous margins.

1450
00:59:51,651 --> 00:59:52,101
They were like,
well,

1451
00:59:52,101 --> 00:59:54,290
what the fuck?
Same as the woman in Australia.

1452
00:59:54,291 --> 00:59:56,600
That's the weightlifter.
This is different.

1453
00:59:56,601 --> 00:59:57,434
This is fighting.
And I think fighting Fox almost killed 

1454
01:00:00,591 --> 01:00:02,750
that woman.
She beat the shit out of a few girls,

1455
01:00:02,751 --> 01:00:06,350
but then she lost Ashley,
Evan Smith who is a biological female,

1456
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:07,700
you know,
so it's.

1457
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:10,010
You can beat someone like that.
But again,

1458
01:00:10,011 --> 01:00:10,844
Ronda Rousey probably beat the fuck out 
of most 135 pound men in the world that 

1459
01:00:15,610 --> 01:00:16,730
she meets.
Of course,

1460
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:18,530
you know,
it's just a matter of skill level.

1461
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:20,780
It's no different than ped,
like banning pdds.

1462
01:00:20,781 --> 01:00:24,740
We want to do that same thing.
It's altering the body's chemistry,

1463
01:00:24,741 --> 01:00:25,850
its abilities.
Right?

1464
01:00:25,851 --> 01:00:27,500
And so you don't want to compete against
someone,

1465
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:30,290
show us that difference or unless you 
know,

1466
01:00:30,490 --> 01:00:31,323
right as you're saying,
and then you can or unless you're 

1467
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:35,780
allowed to do the same thing,
then it's all fair,

1468
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:37,270
but you couldn't.
You would.

1469
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:40,430
The woman would have to take 
testosterone and balance it out and then

1470
01:00:40,431 --> 01:00:41,264
you'd have to find out how would you 
balance out 30 years of my body 

1471
01:00:43,971 --> 01:00:44,804
naturally producing testosterone,
increasing your ligaments strength and 

1472
01:00:46,681 --> 01:00:48,460
conditioning attendant strength.
You also have,

1473
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:52,700
there's mechanical advantages of male 
hips are very different when it comes to

1474
01:00:52,701 --> 01:00:53,480
kicking.

1475
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:55,340
When it comes to certain types of 
movement.

1476
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:59,960
Women's hips go out and then their legs 
kind of come in at an angle and it's not

1477
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:03,260
not the best for kicking.
It's not the best for a lot of different

1478
01:01:03,261 --> 01:01:04,640
activities.
Different.

1479
01:01:04,641 --> 01:01:08,630
So I would just say that a trans woman 
is absolutely,

1480
01:01:08,631 --> 01:01:09,950
in my view,
a woman,

1481
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,480
fine.
You know,

1482
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:14,180
I've done.
That's their identity and I respect that

1483
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:17,840
however they want to identify because 
the category of woman,

1484
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:19,100
as you said,
is so fluid,

1485
01:01:19,790 --> 01:01:20,570
you know,
let.

1486
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:21,403
I'm not going to say there's any 
absolute about that either that it can 

1487
01:01:23,691 --> 01:01:24,670
change and it's,
you know,

1488
01:01:24,690 --> 01:01:25,523
comes from her ideas,
but still I respect that and I'll call 

1489
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:29,780
you a woman.
I'll treat you like a woman,

1490
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:32,810
but that means we have to change the 
sports,

1491
01:01:32,870 --> 01:01:33,703
right?
And we have to have just different 

1492
01:01:34,221 --> 01:01:35,054
categories.
Instead of women's sports and man's 

1493
01:01:36,991 --> 01:01:37,824
sports,
we need to have an woman and man 

1494
01:01:39,681 --> 01:01:41,000
categories in those sports.

1495
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:41,833
We need to have different categories 
that are about people's physical 

1496
01:01:44,301 --> 01:01:46,430
composition,
what you're made up of.

1497
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:47,293
Right?
So it just like weight classes and pe 

1498
01:01:48,481 --> 01:01:49,640
days.
There's no difference to me.

1499
01:01:49,730 --> 01:01:50,563
Well,
or there could be the argument that a 

1500
01:01:52,401 --> 01:01:54,560
person,
a trans woman is a woman,

1501
01:01:54,890 --> 01:01:57,500
but when you're talking about athletic 
competition,

1502
01:01:57,501 --> 01:01:59,390
you're talking about a very biological 
thing.

1503
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:00,253
I'm saying if you take.
You might have to say that someone has 

1504
01:02:01,761 --> 01:02:03,740
to be a biological female to compete.
Again,

1505
01:02:03,741 --> 01:02:05,810
I'm saying take the gender out of the 
sport,

1506
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:06,620
right?
If you take that,

1507
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:08,450
if you stopped calling these gender 
names,

1508
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:10,730
then it's,
then it's definitely not a trans issue.

1509
01:02:11,210 --> 01:02:12,770
It's just about what your body's made up
of.

1510
01:02:12,771 --> 01:02:15,760
So for instance,
adjust weight class Germane to random,

1511
01:02:15,761 --> 01:02:18,260
he is pro,
I don't know Rhonda Rousey more likely.

1512
01:02:18,261 --> 01:02:20,610
It's probably made just physically

1513
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:25,470
more like closer to a man,
closer to Yoel Romero than Andy Dick.

1514
01:02:25,471 --> 01:02:28,110
How dare you.
She's going to find this and she's going

1515
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:29,280
to find you.
Gosh,

1516
01:02:29,281 --> 01:02:32,220
I hope so.
If someone likes to be hit,

1517
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:35,670
it really choked out real fast.
Um,

1518
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:37,170
yeah.
So,

1519
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,340
so that means I would just say,
you know,

1520
01:02:39,390 --> 01:02:42,480
there should be a category you know,
of in the sport,

1521
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:43,333
you know,
for people who are made up of that 

1522
01:02:44,131 --> 01:02:44,964
composition and that could be people 
that the society identifies as men and 

1523
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,920
who are or who identify as women or 
whatever.

1524
01:02:49,950 --> 01:02:50,641
Oh Man.
That's a,

1525
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:52,020
that's a slippery slope.
Why?

1526
01:02:52,021 --> 01:02:54,560
There's a lot of work there because like
what,

1527
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:55,553
I mean,
how would you define it and what 

1528
01:02:57,001 --> 01:02:59,040
parameters would use bone density?
Well,

1529
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:01,260
you know,
are a lot of African American women have

1530
01:03:01,261 --> 01:03:02,094
similar bone density to white males.
So does that mean you should be able to 

1531
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:05,820
fight black checks?

1532
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:06,893
Uh,
maybe.

1533
01:03:08,130 --> 01:03:08,911
It depends,
right?

1534
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:09,541
So,
well,

1535
01:03:09,541 --> 01:03:10,374
no,
actually the kind of aren't doing it up 

1536
01:03:12,530 --> 01:03:15,180
the old man,
I'm not messing with that and we'll even

1537
01:03:15,181 --> 01:03:15,690
though she's like,
what,

1538
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:17,590
60 years old,
she gets down to 50.

1539
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,370
You could crush me.
Um,

1540
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:20,520
no,
but I mean they are doing it.

1541
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:22,080
In fact,
we just saw this with,

1542
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:24,600
what's her name?
A caster Semenya.

1543
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:27,660
But what are they doing with all this?
It's the thing about testosterone level.

1544
01:03:27,661 --> 01:03:29,400
What do they do?
Actually they mentioned her.

1545
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:30,270
No,
there's,

1546
01:03:30,270 --> 01:03:33,570
there's a number for testosterone that 
you have to be below,

1547
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:34,630
right,
to,

1548
01:03:34,850 --> 01:03:37,090
to compete in that sport as a woman.
So that's,

1549
01:03:37,110 --> 01:03:40,050
that's what I'm talking about.
Just add more categories,

1550
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:41,880
not just testosterone.
You have to have.

1551
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:43,040
That's what this says.
Okay.

1552
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:45,600
It says your testosterone goes above a 
certain level.

1553
01:03:45,630 --> 01:03:47,280
You're not allowed to compete as a 
woman.

1554
01:03:47,310 --> 01:03:51,180
So I'm saying have that category and add
more categories like that.

1555
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:53,760
And don't call it women.
And men just say it's category x.

1556
01:03:53,761 --> 01:03:57,030
You get to compete in this category if 
your testosterone,

1557
01:03:57,530 --> 01:04:01,950
androgens what they're saying,
but it's so ridiculously loose.

1558
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:07,160
It's saying a female with Hypo Androgen 
Ism who is recognized as a female in law

1559
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:08,693
shall be eligible to compete and women's
competition in athletics provided that 

1560
01:04:10,891 --> 01:04:14,550
she has androgen levels below the male 
range,

1561
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:17,820
like all you have to do is just be like 
a couple notches below the male range,

1562
01:04:17,970 --> 01:04:18,803
which is way above,
but I'm saying that's all objectively 

1563
01:04:22,681 --> 01:04:23,514
determined you can do that.
They're trying to get her to take 

1564
01:04:25,021 --> 01:04:27,660
suppression medication or.
That's what I'm saying.

1565
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:29,393
This is all proving my point.
These are objectively determine with 

1566
01:04:31,761 --> 01:04:35,310
them making her tone it down.
We have numbers.

1567
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:38,550
We say if you hit this number for this 
category,

1568
01:04:38,551 --> 01:04:41,000
you don't get to compete here,
but this is so,

1569
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:42,090
so rare.

1570
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:45,480
I mean she has a disease essentially 
where she produces too much to stop.

1571
01:04:45,481 --> 01:04:47,520
This would apply to trans people is what
I'm saying.

1572
01:04:47,521 --> 01:04:49,140
Right.
So if you.

1573
01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:50,183
But what it.
Because even so you're still dealing 

1574
01:04:52,561 --> 01:04:54,650
with the mechanical advantages of the 
male frame.

1575
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:56,850
The wider shoulder,
especially when it comes to hitting.

1576
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,090
We could do that too and we do it with 
weight already.

1577
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:02,400
Why not a height?
Sure.

1578
01:05:02,910 --> 01:05:03,960
Boy,
in fact,

1579
01:05:03,961 --> 01:05:06,630
a lot of work I thought about that will 
look.

1580
01:05:06,810 --> 01:05:08,370
I'm sure you have to like in weight 
classes,

1581
01:05:08,371 --> 01:05:10,890
right?
Like I have a huge advantage.

1582
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:12,510
I always use it.
I'm six,

1583
01:05:12,511 --> 01:05:15,300
one,
one 65 and I've really long arms,

1584
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:17,710
so like most the time

1585
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,070
people can't get inside my job.
Like I just put it out there.

1586
01:05:21,071 --> 01:05:21,904
They can and it's just a thing,
but it's like I often feel like this 

1587
01:05:24,071 --> 01:05:26,080
isn't really fair in a way,
you know,

1588
01:05:26,081 --> 01:05:26,914
I don't have to be as good as they are.
I can be looser and it's true for a lot 

1589
01:05:30,191 --> 01:05:32,350
of fighters,
but once they get inside on you,

1590
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:33,213
they have an advantage.
Like Mike Tyson used that advantage of 

1591
01:05:35,741 --> 01:05:38,530
being 5:10 on a lot of fighters an 
advantage.

1592
01:05:38,531 --> 01:05:40,540
I think he just was really good at 
overcoming it.

1593
01:05:40,830 --> 01:05:41,663
Hm.
I think there's an in fighting and 

1594
01:05:43,751 --> 01:05:44,584
having shorter arms and he did the lower
he did the peekaboo past the jab 

1595
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:49,970
maximize really well.
Really?

1596
01:05:50,110 --> 01:05:52,460
He did that thing where it's did rocky 
Marciano and Danny,

1597
01:05:52,770 --> 01:05:53,603
he had a really good way of getting 
inside of slipping the jab and moving 

1598
01:05:58,001 --> 01:05:58,834
constantly until he was inside on you 
and then he will crush you with this 

1599
01:06:00,431 --> 01:06:02,170
huge left hook,
but once he's there,

1600
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:03,820
he doesn't have an advantage on you.

1601
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:04,683
He's just there and he's Mike Tyson,
but you don't think it's harder for a 

1602
01:06:06,701 --> 01:06:07,534
guy with a long ass spider arms to punch
a guy who is in tight on you with short 

1603
01:06:12,041 --> 01:06:14,110
arms and is throwing shots to the body 
like Tyson.

1604
01:06:14,190 --> 01:06:15,890
So I don't think so.
I don't think so.

1605
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:19,270
I think there's advantages as long as 
you are physically competent.

1606
01:06:19,271 --> 01:06:20,104
There's advantages in particular 
movements and positions to all sorts of 

1607
01:06:22,961 --> 01:06:25,840
different body styles.
It's very true in Jujitsu guys with long

1608
01:06:25,841 --> 01:06:29,020
arms and long legs and digits.
You have massive advantages with chokes.

1609
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:32,710
You guys can get Darcis and guillotines 
and triangles easier,

1610
01:06:32,890 --> 01:06:33,723
but you can also get arm barred easier 
because the mechanical advantages and 

1611
01:06:36,221 --> 01:06:37,410
armbarring you.
There's,

1612
01:06:37,530 --> 01:06:38,363
there's,
there's some weird advantages to being 

1613
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:43,570
like a twosome are Paul Horez,
stocky short guy.

1614
01:06:43,870 --> 01:06:45,220
Here's basket.
How about basketball?

1615
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:45,911
There you go.
Oh,

1616
01:06:45,911 --> 01:06:47,350
it's all advantages tall.

1617
01:06:47,350 --> 01:06:49,480
Right.
And in fact there are leagues,

1618
01:06:49,481 --> 01:06:50,314
not an.
Actually there might be professional 

1619
01:06:51,161 --> 01:06:51,910
leagues which are,
you know,

1620
01:06:51,910 --> 01:06:53,600
six feet and under leagues.
Brilliant.

1621
01:06:53,740 --> 01:06:55,080
Yeah.
Many leads.

1622
01:06:55,290 --> 01:06:56,123
Many P,
this is very common because most people 

1623
01:06:57,401 --> 01:06:58,630
are under six feet tall.
Right.

1624
01:06:58,631 --> 01:06:59,464
So who could never play in the NBA even 
though they're amazing basketball 

1625
01:07:02,171 --> 01:07:03,004
players,
but they just don't have the arm length 

1626
01:07:04,211 --> 01:07:05,440
and they don't have the height and all 
that.

1627
01:07:05,470 --> 01:07:07,870
That's interesting.
So we just need more divisions.

1628
01:07:07,871 --> 01:07:09,040
The UFC,
you should have like,

1629
01:07:09,041 --> 01:07:09,791
you know,
welter weight,

1630
01:07:09,791 --> 01:07:13,250
it should be,
there should be heights within it to was

1631
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:14,680
only five nines.
There's a current.

1632
01:07:14,681 --> 01:07:17,770
Isaiah Thomas,
he's a good player for the number ones.

1633
01:07:17,890 --> 01:07:18,723
Fantastic.
He's the guys that are under six foot 

1634
01:07:20,651 --> 01:07:21,281
though.
He's a great,

1635
01:07:21,281 --> 01:07:22,570
great player.
Around six foot.

1636
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:25,800
They get listed higher to the cheat.
So interesting.

1637
01:07:25,950 --> 01:07:26,610
He's.
So.

1638
01:07:26,610 --> 01:07:28,360
He's sort of the exception that proves 
the rule.

1639
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:31,170
He's five nine,
but he's really successful.

1640
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:31,860
Yeah.
He's five,

1641
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:32,260
three,
five,

1642
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:33,970
six or something like three,
five,

1643
01:07:33,971 --> 01:07:35,110
three,
five,

1644
01:07:35,111 --> 01:07:38,180
three and dunked.
Spicy.

1645
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:39,670
Did five.
No,

1646
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:40,700
I'm pretty sure.
Mugs,

1647
01:07:40,730 --> 01:07:41,620
you'd pull it up.
Jamie.

1648
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:47,220
Jamie is my wheelhouse and you're in 
Jamie's wheelhouse in a big way,

1649
01:07:47,441 --> 01:07:48,180
right?
There's your mugs,

1650
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:50,640
but I'm pretty sure he ducked muggsy.
Bogues.

1651
01:07:50,641 --> 01:07:53,020
He may not have been a super clean dunk,
but it was a dunk.

1652
01:07:53,050 --> 01:07:54,370
Let's see.
10 out.

1653
01:07:55,270 --> 01:07:57,610
Let's see if he dunked.
Let go with a video.

1654
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,680
That's my life goal was to say pull it 
up Jamie.

1655
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,050
Okay.
This spot web was mugsy.

1656
01:08:04,010 --> 01:08:05,810
Does it have a video of him dunking?

1657
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:10,170
I don't think so.
We've never seen it in my google.

1658
01:08:10,171 --> 01:08:10,770
Muggsy.
Bogues.

1659
01:08:10,770 --> 01:08:11,770
Yeah.
What does she do?

1660
01:08:12,510 --> 01:08:15,050
Muggsy.
Bogues dunk and he did it.

1661
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:17,150
Google that crazy.
Muggsy.

1662
01:08:17,151 --> 01:08:19,880
Bogues dunk Jamie.
Number two on Google.

1663
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:21,770
Let's say I got to watch this.
I've never,

1664
01:08:21,771 --> 01:08:25,330
ever seen this in my entire life.
Dude.

1665
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:29,090
He just in a video game,
that's probably not real.

1666
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,070
Yeah,
I know,

1667
01:08:30,130 --> 01:08:30,963
but he really did.
I promise you in Mba life is in my 

1668
01:08:33,021 --> 01:08:35,180
memory,
is that it wasn't a clean,

1669
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:36,193
super clean dunk,
but he did get the ball above the rim 

1670
01:08:37,791 --> 01:08:38,624
with his hand on it.
We're going to get to the bottom of 

1671
01:08:40,041 --> 01:08:41,090
this.
Ladies and gentlemen,

1672
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:41,983
join,
you'll get to that place is pretty 

1673
01:08:43,401 --> 01:08:47,150
essential if we don't solve this is a 
failure of a podcast.

1674
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:50,280
There's a big difference I think between
team sports where you know,

1675
01:08:50,350 --> 01:08:51,183
you could have an advantage of having a 
spud webb or muggsy bogues very mobile 

1676
01:08:54,290 --> 01:08:58,370
agile kind of guy who can set plays up 
versus guy like Shaq,

1677
01:08:58,550 --> 01:08:59,383
big giant guy who can get in the way of 
things and I think there's all sorts of 

1678
01:09:03,651 --> 01:09:04,484
advantages and disadvantages of that 
size when you're talking about 

1679
01:09:06,110 --> 01:09:08,450
individuals against individuals.

1680
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:09,553
That's where things get weird.
And then when you're talking about 

1681
01:09:10,791 --> 01:09:14,430
combat sports,
that's where people have just.

1682
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:17,480
There's some people that just have these
tremendous advantages.

1683
01:09:17,481 --> 01:09:18,240
Like,
you know,

1684
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:22,790
Paul Daley is ridiculous power,
like almost unfair.

1685
01:09:22,990 --> 01:09:25,340
Like he hits guys and just obliterate.
Yeah.

1686
01:09:25,341 --> 01:09:27,230
But you know,
that's not just strength.

1687
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,070
Yes.
Yeah.

1688
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:31,250
And it's also,
it's also geometry.

1689
01:09:31,251 --> 01:09:32,510
Body geometry.
Yes.

1690
01:09:32,530 --> 01:09:33,140
Right.
Yes.

1691
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:35,750
Lot of skinny dudes like me have power 
some.

1692
01:09:35,850 --> 01:09:36,683
Yeah,
a lot.

1693
01:09:36,730 --> 01:09:37,810
Yeah.
Right.

1694
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:41,020
And a lot of big Tommy hearns was the 
best example is a bunch of them,

1695
01:09:41,150 --> 01:09:41,983
but he's also like this wide and then 
his waist is like this and this angle 

1696
01:09:45,631 --> 01:09:48,830
just I've thought it's actually.
I've actually thought his shoulder with.

1697
01:09:49,070 --> 01:09:50,000
Yeah,
I think what I'm saying.

1698
01:09:50,001 --> 01:09:50,900
Yeah.
You get that slide.

1699
01:09:52,470 --> 01:09:54,830
So this,
the shoulders like that torque.

1700
01:09:54,831 --> 01:09:55,431
Yeah,
exactly.

1701
01:09:55,431 --> 01:09:57,680
I mean it's more to swing.
Yeah.

1702
01:09:57,681 --> 01:09:58,010
That way.

1703
01:09:58,010 --> 01:09:58,843
Yeah,
for sure.

1704
01:09:58,850 --> 01:09:59,980
Wide shoulders,
uh,

1705
01:10:00,170 --> 01:10:01,880
rotate around the spine.
Yeah.

1706
01:10:02,170 --> 01:10:03,003
Oftentimes equate,
especially when they learn striking 

1707
01:10:04,911 --> 01:10:05,744
sports at an early age.
They learn how to develop that snap and 

1708
01:10:08,091 --> 01:10:10,130
fluidity.
Tenants to a lot of muscle bound.

1709
01:10:10,131 --> 01:10:11,500
Guys don't,
don't know.

1710
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:14,320
So they do,
they have it.

1711
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,910
I want you to go talk to Dana and get 
this,

1712
01:10:16,970 --> 01:10:18,100
get this going.
And we,

1713
01:10:18,210 --> 01:10:20,170
we need a height,
uh,

1714
01:10:20,180 --> 01:10:21,450
divisions we need.
Um,

1715
01:10:22,070 --> 01:10:24,060
we need testosterone,
you know,

1716
01:10:24,061 --> 01:10:25,940
division to comp,
testosterone level,

1717
01:10:26,030 --> 01:10:28,040
division.
Going to have estrogen level divisions.

1718
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:29,053
I think we're where are literally one 
generation away from being able to use 

1719
01:10:33,411 --> 01:10:34,244
crispr and all these new genetic 
engineering tools to make people 

1720
01:10:38,091 --> 01:10:38,924
whatever style of person you want.
I think you're going to be able to 

1721
01:10:41,901 --> 01:10:42,734
develop six foot,
four super athletes that look like 

1722
01:10:45,171 --> 01:10:48,650
Anthony Josh or Vitali Klitschko or 
Vladimir Klitschko.

1723
01:10:48,651 --> 01:10:52,160
You're going to be able to make those 
now what I would give for bionic knees,

1724
01:10:52,161 --> 01:10:52,870
right.

1725
01:10:52,870 --> 01:10:54,510
These are fucked up,
but never when they're not,

1726
01:10:54,530 --> 01:10:55,271
they're okay.
They're.

1727
01:10:55,271 --> 01:10:56,660
They're problematic,
but I can.

1728
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:59,480
I can function fine,
but they could go out and anytime.

1729
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:01,460
You know what I mean?
If you've never been worried about that,

1730
01:11:01,940 --> 01:11:03,200
he never had to worry.
Right.

1731
01:11:03,410 --> 01:11:04,730
Can you imagine?
Well,

1732
01:11:04,731 --> 01:11:05,564
if you could just reduce,
but I'm telling you what they were 

1733
01:11:07,431 --> 01:11:10,070
talking about before the podcast,
what they're doing now with stem cells,

1734
01:11:10,071 --> 01:11:12,710
with soft tissue injuries.
It's tremendous.

1735
01:11:12,711 --> 01:11:14,010
I mean,
it's really amazing.

1736
01:11:14,030 --> 01:11:14,863
It's never happened before.
What they're able to do to people that 

1737
01:11:17,401 --> 01:11:18,234
have meniscus injuries is literally 
shoot stem cells in there and you've 

1738
01:11:21,421 --> 01:11:23,200
regenerate meniscus tissue.
I mean,

1739
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:27,120
that's just never happened before and I 
think that this is baby steps.

1740
01:11:27,121 --> 01:11:29,040
I think what we're at right now is 
really,

1741
01:11:29,041 --> 01:11:31,140
really young.
I don't think 20,

1742
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:35,310
30 years from now because 20 years ago 
they didn't really use it at all.

1743
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,690
Twenty years from now,
I think it's going to be insane.

1744
01:11:37,730 --> 01:11:38,491
Got to be able to.
I mean,

1745
01:11:38,491 --> 01:11:42,420
they're regenerated a woman's bladder 
using her skin tissue.

1746
01:11:42,890 --> 01:11:45,360
They built her a bladder.
She had bladder cancer.

1747
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:49,220
They built her a bladder and then 
reinstalled it in her body.

1748
01:11:49,221 --> 01:11:52,140
Now she has a functional bladder that 
came out of her own body.

1749
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:54,330
They're regenerated.
I think they're gonna be able to do that

1750
01:11:54,331 --> 01:11:56,760
with tendons and ligaments and all sorts
of tissue.

1751
01:11:56,761 --> 01:11:59,790
I believe it,
and hopefully this is really promising.

1752
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:02,040
They're going to be able to do that with
brain tissue,

1753
01:12:02,310 --> 01:12:05,590
so people that have had brain injuries,
people that have had cte,

1754
01:12:05,790 --> 01:12:06,623
they're hopefully going to be able to 
use some of these therapies to 

1755
01:12:08,401 --> 01:12:10,170
regenerate brain tissue.
Wow.

1756
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:12,000
Yes.
That's huge.

1757
01:12:12,001 --> 01:12:14,170
Neurogenesis is,
that's,

1758
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:16,410
that's the promise land.
God bless him.

1759
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:18,240
You know,
I don't know anything about science.

1760
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:20,850
I'm just a complete idiot when it comes 
to math and science.

1761
01:12:20,850 --> 01:12:22,350
But man,
just go for it.

1762
01:12:22,351 --> 01:12:23,970
And by the way,
as far as universities,

1763
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:25,240
you know,
I'm,

1764
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:28,320
I am the harshest critics of 
universities generally,

1765
01:12:28,321 --> 01:12:29,154
but well,
mostly what I'm talking about it 

1766
01:12:29,651 --> 01:12:31,950
actually the humanities and social 
sciences when I do that,

1767
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,710
what goes on in the biology building,
the chemistry building,

1768
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:36,240
the physics building,
I don't know,

1769
01:12:36,241 --> 01:12:40,650
but I know that what comes out of them 
is a better life for me and all of us,

1770
01:12:40,990 --> 01:12:43,980
they're making this stuff that you're 
talking about and so go for it.

1771
01:12:43,981 --> 01:12:45,140
And so,
you know,

1772
01:12:45,150 --> 01:12:46,380
renegade universities,
not,

1773
01:12:46,381 --> 01:12:47,850
we're not gonna do no science.
We're going to let,

1774
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:50,130
we're going to let Harvard and mit keep 
going.

1775
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:51,670
Have that guys,
you know,

1776
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:52,913
because you're doing great stuff.
I have no critique of that as far as I 

1777
01:12:54,541 --> 01:12:55,374
know.
There's nothing going on there that's 

1778
01:12:55,711 --> 01:12:56,544
wrong,
but it's just the humanities and social 

1779
01:12:58,021 --> 01:12:59,430
sciences that are utterly corrupt.

1780
01:12:59,490 --> 01:13:00,323
Well,
we got way off the track here with what 

1781
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:04,260
we were talking about initially was 
Jordan Peterson.

1782
01:13:04,570 --> 01:13:05,403
I disagree with him when it comes to 
gender and what you agree with him when 

1783
01:13:07,771 --> 01:13:08,604
it comes to the suppression of 
expression of professors and all the 

1784
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:13,673
people worried about being called racist
and sexist and anything else stifling 

1785
01:13:17,161 --> 01:13:20,870
free speech.
So what he's facing is even worse than,

1786
01:13:21,050 --> 01:13:24,060
than what goes on in the United States 
in a sense.

1787
01:13:24,061 --> 01:13:26,310
And that it's,
it's now legal persecution.

1788
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:28,140
He is actually,
you know,

1789
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:33,240
it's against the law to not use these 
gender pronouns in your class.

1790
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:36,570
Um,
which is that suppression of speech,

1791
01:13:36,571 --> 01:13:37,404
that suppression of Academic Freedom.
It's a complete violation of those 

1792
01:13:39,571 --> 01:13:40,261
things.
In fact.

1793
01:13:40,261 --> 01:13:43,050
And that's totalitarian.
I mean there's nothing,

1794
01:13:43,230 --> 01:13:46,520
no two ways around it.
My uncle at Canada has these,

1795
01:13:46,610 --> 01:13:48,020
these laws,
right?

1796
01:13:48,021 --> 01:13:49,920
And they have a human rights commission,
I think it's called or human,

1797
01:13:49,921 --> 01:13:51,960
something conditioned human rights 
council council.

1798
01:13:51,961 --> 01:13:52,794
And they do this body of people who sit 
there and decide who should have a 

1799
01:13:55,231 --> 01:13:57,720
website or not.
And my uncle is actually happened to him

1800
01:13:57,721 --> 01:13:58,554
about 10 years ago.
He was accused of being a Holocaust 

1801
01:13:59,821 --> 01:14:00,654
denier because,
and I don't even know exactly what he 

1802
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:04,224
was saying on there,
but he's a Ukrainian and I think he was 

1803
01:14:06,001 --> 01:14:06,834
sorta just defending these Ukrainians 
who were accused of being Nazis during 

1804
01:14:10,121 --> 01:14:11,680
the World War II.
I don't know.

1805
01:14:11,770 --> 01:14:12,100
It doesn't

1806
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:13,960
matter.
Even if he were a holocaust denier,

1807
01:14:14,230 --> 01:14:15,790
he should have his website.
Right?

1808
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:17,710
The Canadian.
You go to that url,

1809
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:18,840
it's shut down.
In effect,

1810
01:14:18,850 --> 01:14:19,683
they put a banner now it says this is 
now controlled by the Canadian 

1811
01:14:22,751 --> 01:14:24,240
government or something.
Oh No.

1812
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:24,731
Yeah,
no.

1813
01:14:24,731 --> 01:14:26,650
They have no free speech in Canada.
I mean there's no.

1814
01:14:26,651 --> 01:14:27,484
There's no sort of doctrine.
Legal or otherwise in Canada of free 

1815
01:14:30,611 --> 01:14:33,010
speech is bad and that's what Jordan 
Peterson's facing.

1816
01:14:33,011 --> 01:14:33,844
It's because he's Canadian.
This would not happen in the United 

1817
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:36,940
States until,
of course,

1818
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:37,953
you know,
the sociologists take control and then 

1819
01:14:40,331 --> 01:14:42,190
they will have these laws,
but we don't have them here,

1820
01:14:42,340 --> 01:14:45,160
so he actually could go to prison.
That's what's,

1821
01:14:45,850 --> 01:14:50,110
that's what's happening.
He could go to prison for not saying xer

1822
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:53,520
in his class.
There was an article that vice published

1823
01:14:53,521 --> 01:14:54,354
that someone linked to me today about 
this that I did not read yet because I 

1824
01:14:57,781 --> 01:14:58,614
announced the Jordan is going to be 
returning to the podcasts and someone 

1825
01:15:00,751 --> 01:15:05,460
was saying that his interpretation of 
these laws is greatly exaggerated.

1826
01:15:05,730 --> 01:15:08,850
See if you could find that.
It's a very recent advice article.

1827
01:15:08,851 --> 01:15:11,790
I'm pretty sure it's illegal and illegal
means you can go to prison.

1828
01:15:11,791 --> 01:15:13,860
Ultimately,
I don't think Jordan's wrong and I don't

1829
01:15:13,861 --> 01:15:14,550
think he would.
Exactly.

1830
01:15:14,550 --> 01:15:14,811
No,
no,

1831
01:15:14,811 --> 01:15:15,680
no.
I looked into this.

1832
01:15:15,681 --> 01:15:18,020
It's elite because that matters a lot to
me.

1833
01:15:19,490 --> 01:15:20,323
I am a hundred percent and solidarity 
with him on that and he's completely 

1834
01:15:24,531 --> 01:15:25,364
right that the state,
no one should be telling him to what to 

1835
01:15:27,950 --> 01:15:28,783
say in his classroom and certainly 
shouldn't be going to prison for it or 

1836
01:15:30,801 --> 01:15:34,490
being threatened in any way legally.
He was just a fine a fine.

1837
01:15:34,491 --> 01:15:35,720
Right.
People don't understand this.

1838
01:15:35,721 --> 01:15:36,554
It's incredible how people don't 
understand that everything the state 

1839
01:15:39,801 --> 01:15:43,190
does is enforced by the threat of 
ultimate violence.

1840
01:15:43,430 --> 01:15:46,190
Right?
So my mother even said this recently.

1841
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:46,701
She said,
oh,

1842
01:15:46,701 --> 01:15:47,534
it doesn't it.
There is no violence with parking 

1843
01:15:48,591 --> 01:15:49,820
tickets.
They just send you a fine.

1844
01:15:49,821 --> 01:15:50,480
I said,
Oh really?

1845
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:52,790
So if you get the fine and you don't pay
it,

1846
01:15:53,390 --> 01:15:54,223
what happens?
Then we get another notice and another 

1847
01:15:55,341 --> 01:15:55,941
notice,
right?

1848
01:15:55,941 --> 01:15:58,490
Mom and then another notice and then 
finally what happens?

1849
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:01,700
Korryn gaines is black woman in Maryland
a couple of years ago.

1850
01:16:01,701 --> 01:16:02,534
This is exactly what happened.
You got a bunch of traffic tickets and 

1851
01:16:03,951 --> 01:16:07,370
she's refused to pay them and ultimately
what happened,

1852
01:16:07,371 --> 01:16:08,204
the Swat team came to her house and she 
pulled a gun and they shot her in the 

1853
01:16:12,681 --> 01:16:16,190
head.
That was over traffic fines.

1854
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:17,840
Okay.
That's what happens.

1855
01:16:17,841 --> 01:16:21,230
That's what it means to make something 
illegal at the end of the day,

1856
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:23,810
for the.
For it to be meaningful as a law,

1857
01:16:24,050 --> 01:16:24,883
the state has to use lethal violence to 
enforce it or the potential for lethal 

1858
01:16:30,051 --> 01:16:30,771
while.
In other words,

1859
01:16:30,771 --> 01:16:34,310
if you don't pay your taxes,
even if it's $100 in taxes,

1860
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:37,160
ultimately otherwise the law is 
meaningless,

1861
01:16:37,170 --> 01:16:38,620
right?
They have to eat.

1862
01:16:38,690 --> 01:16:40,370
They have to put you in prison or kill 
you.

1863
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:41,373
Well,
that was what was most offensive about 

1864
01:16:42,311 --> 01:16:43,900
that.
Sandra Bland case,

1865
01:16:43,901 --> 01:16:46,960
when you got to hear the interaction 
between her and the cop,

1866
01:16:47,230 --> 01:16:48,063
she did nothing wrong and this cop is 
dragging her out of the car and then 

1867
01:16:51,551 --> 01:16:54,530
ultimately she died and they don't know 
how she died and there's,

1868
01:16:54,550 --> 01:16:55,383
she was pissed off.
She talked back because he pulled her 

1869
01:16:57,131 --> 01:16:58,680
over.
Fleet told her to put out her cigarette.

1870
01:16:59,170 --> 01:17:00,003
Right.
And she's like,

1871
01:17:00,460 --> 01:17:02,730
because she was being disrespectful.
Exactly.

1872
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:04,600
She wasn't.
If you listen to the,

1873
01:17:04,610 --> 01:17:05,810
the,
the actual record.

1874
01:17:05,811 --> 01:17:06,190
No,
no.

1875
01:17:06,190 --> 01:17:09,770
She just wasn't following him to the 
like

1876
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:13,250
she wasn't treating him with respect 
that he felt he deserved hold on there.

1877
01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:16,250
I think she was being disrespectful and 
that's why she's my hero.

1878
01:17:16,620 --> 01:17:19,670
I mean,
because think she was disrespectful.

1879
01:17:19,730 --> 01:17:20,563
That's why she's a hero,
but I don't think she was because you 

1880
01:17:23,781 --> 01:17:25,400
shouldn't be.
You shouldn't respect that.

1881
01:17:25,420 --> 01:17:26,253
I thought.
I mean it's dangerous and that's why 

1882
01:17:26,841 --> 01:17:28,450
she's a martyr.
I'm not.

1883
01:17:28,451 --> 01:17:30,140
I wouldn't,
I wouldn't recommend it to people.

1884
01:17:30,141 --> 01:17:34,640
I wouldn't tell my son to do that,
but he deserved no respect.

1885
01:17:35,690 --> 01:17:40,310
The law enforcing that law in that way,
treating her in that way,

1886
01:17:40,311 --> 01:17:41,144
in that moment was deserved.
No respect whatsoever and that's to me 

1887
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:47,000
why she's the hero,
not that she was a victim,

1888
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:48,073
she was a victim,
but to me what was great about her was 

1889
01:17:50,451 --> 01:17:51,410
that she said,
no,

1890
01:17:51,411 --> 01:17:53,660
I'm not gonna put up my cigarette and 
why did you pull me over for this?

1891
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:54,830
This is bullshit.
Well,

1892
01:17:54,831 --> 01:17:55,664
I mean,
you have no reason to pull me over and 

1893
01:17:56,241 --> 01:17:58,100
do this to me right now.
I'm on my way to someplace.

1894
01:17:58,101 --> 01:18:00,320
I'm trying to get some.
Is she getting pulled over for.

1895
01:18:00,321 --> 01:18:02,790
I think it was a.
I think it was as it was a lighter.

1896
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:05,030
So she like didn't turn.
I think it was a turn signal.

1897
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,540
Okay.
It was something really trivial.

1898
01:18:07,541 --> 01:18:08,374
Well,
I don't think he has the right to tell 

1899
01:18:09,621 --> 01:18:13,700
her to put out her cigarette.
So that's not a disrespectful thing.

1900
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:14,893
He's overstepping his boundaries.
I need to do in your car smoking a 

1901
01:18:19,221 --> 01:18:20,810
cigarette in her car.
They have the right,

1902
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:21,703
they have the right and I think in some 
municipalities the obligation because 

1903
01:18:25,551 --> 01:18:27,530
you are supposed to.
Here's the thing where Joe,

1904
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:28,393
I mean,
this is the other thing is this is the 

1905
01:18:29,841 --> 01:18:31,160
thing that La rests upon.

1906
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:34,580
It rests upon us respecting legal 
authorities.

1907
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,620
If we don't,
there ain't no law.

1908
01:18:36,770 --> 01:18:37,603
Yeah,
but there's no legal authority for you 

1909
01:18:38,901 --> 01:18:43,901
to stop you from doing a lawful act like
if she has a cigarette lit in our car.

1910
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:45,800
When she gets pulled over,
the cops says,

1911
01:18:45,801 --> 01:18:48,380
put your cigarette out.
What he's doing is just controlling her.

1912
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:50,750
They don't think they give them 
latitude.

1913
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:51,793
They give the cops latitude in 
determining who is obeying their orders 

1914
01:18:54,831 --> 01:18:56,660
and not.
So if this could be.

1915
01:18:56,661 --> 01:18:59,240
I'm sure this yet,
I'm not defending this.

1916
01:18:59,241 --> 01:19:01,280
I'm saying this is the problem.
I'm saying that in court,

1917
01:19:01,281 --> 01:19:02,114
I would bet you anything he would say 
that show that she wasn't listening to 

1918
01:19:05,421 --> 01:19:07,610
me.
She wasn't obeying my orders.

1919
01:19:07,820 --> 01:19:08,653
I think he told her to put her hands on 
the car or something and she had a 

1920
01:19:10,521 --> 01:19:11,354
cigarette or enhance,
so she had to take the cigarette out of 

1921
01:19:13,191 --> 01:19:14,510
her hand to do what he was asking.

1922
01:19:14,660 --> 01:19:15,493
In other words,
I'm saying that's all worthy of 

1923
01:19:18,381 --> 01:19:20,240
disrespect.
I'm not defending it at all.

1924
01:19:20,241 --> 01:19:23,060
Right.
The other thing though about this,

1925
01:19:23,061 --> 01:19:25,580
and this is something I've been working 
on lately and uh,

1926
01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:30,020
I've been doing some work with some 
people at free think media about this,

1927
01:19:30,510 --> 01:19:34,280
but is I think,
and I've changed my mind about this.

1928
01:19:34,540 --> 01:19:35,373
This has been a new thing for me.
I have thought about race my whole life 

1929
01:19:37,131 --> 01:19:38,540
basically really,
really hard.

1930
01:19:38,541 --> 01:19:40,990
And this is,
I've changed my mind about this when,

1931
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,800
when things like that happen.
Sandra Bland,

1932
01:19:42,801 --> 01:19:44,480
Mike Brown,
Eric Garner,

1933
01:19:45,110 --> 01:19:45,943
even Walter Scott,
the guy who was shot in the back in 

1934
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:51,130
South Carolina.
What have you got where they planted the

1935
01:19:51,410 --> 01:19:52,400
Taser?
Well,

1936
01:19:52,610 --> 01:19:54,320
that's again,
hold on there.

1937
01:19:55,070 --> 01:20:00,070
So I like everyone in the country pretty
much saw those things and thought a,

1938
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:05,090
that's horrific.
A and B,

1939
01:20:05,150 --> 01:20:06,650
that's racist.
Okay.

1940
01:20:06,651 --> 01:20:07,484
And that what people do overwhelmingly 
is they focus on what they believe is 

1941
01:20:13,261 --> 01:20:16,470
the racism of the cop,
the individual,

1942
01:20:16,790 --> 01:20:21,360
that that's what caused those cops to 
shoot those guns in those moments.

1943
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:23,333
I think that's a mistake for one thing.
We will never know why they chose to 

1944
01:20:28,441 --> 01:20:29,850
shoot,
to pull the trigger in that moment.

1945
01:20:29,851 --> 01:20:32,880
We will never know that it was racist.
There's no way to prove that.

1946
01:20:32,970 --> 01:20:35,170
There's no way to demonstrate it.
Um,

1947
01:20:36,090 --> 01:20:38,760
and there's nothing we can do about it.
You can't.

1948
01:20:38,850 --> 01:20:43,320
What can you do to change people's ideas
about race or black people?

1949
01:20:43,321 --> 01:20:44,154
You can't.
Certainly not anytime soon what all 

1950
01:20:47,731 --> 01:20:49,810
those cops were doing and all those 
instances.

1951
01:20:49,890 --> 01:20:50,723
And this is why they got off.
They were following the law and they 

1952
01:20:54,541 --> 01:20:58,350
were following police procedure which 
actually obligated them to do,

1953
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:01,590
to do those things.
So Walter Scott,

1954
01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:05,820
and believe me,
I was convinced that was a racist cop,

1955
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:10,710
that that was clearly a bad killing and 
it was a bad killing,

1956
01:21:10,711 --> 01:21:12,480
but not for the reasons that people are 
talking about.

1957
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:16,320
I have no way to know whether that cop 
was racist and that's why he did that.

1958
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:18,810
But if we do know and people have done 
work on this,

1959
01:21:19,290 --> 01:21:24,290
that he is very reasonable to assume 
that he was doing in that moment what he

1960
01:21:24,631 --> 01:21:25,464
was obligated to do by law,
which is if you look at the video 

1961
01:21:27,241 --> 01:21:28,074
carefully,
he very well could have thought that 

1962
01:21:30,811 --> 01:21:35,811
Scott was still holding his taser 
because Scott grabbed the Taser and then

1963
01:21:36,661 --> 01:21:37,494
dropped it immediately.
But if you look at where the cop is 

1964
01:21:39,451 --> 01:21:40,284
looking,
he may not have seen that we're talking 

1965
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:42,933
about different thing then because I'm 
talking about the cop that shot the guy 

1966
01:21:45,481 --> 01:21:49,080
and then drop the Taser near his body.
We're talking about the same thing.

1967
01:21:49,820 --> 01:21:50,653
Now,
here's what I grabbed the Taser that 

1968
01:21:52,770 --> 01:21:53,650
here's what happened.
Okay.

1969
01:21:53,651 --> 01:21:55,290
Yeah.
Walter Scott grabs his taser.

1970
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:57,110
He grabbed the cops,
Taser crab footage,

1971
01:21:57,130 --> 01:21:57,990
just ran,
pulled,

1972
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:01,980
not pulled the Taser out of his holster 
and had it for a second and then,

1973
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:02,970
and then started to run.

1974
01:22:02,970 --> 01:22:07,110
And as he's turning to run,
he drops it immediately and he's running

1975
01:22:07,111 --> 01:22:07,860
away and it gets,
you know,

1976
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:08,700
a good whatever,
10,

1977
01:22:08,701 --> 01:22:10,470
20 yards away and the cop shoots him in 
the back.

1978
01:22:10,471 --> 01:22:11,304
Okay.
So according to South Carolina police 

1979
01:22:14,041 --> 01:22:14,874
procedure and I,
and according to the Supreme Court 

1980
01:22:16,051 --> 01:22:17,810
decisions,
uh,

1981
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:18,683
the cop not only was had the right,
but the obligation to use lethal force 

1982
01:22:22,711 --> 01:22:23,544
because he could have believed in that 
moment that Scott still held the Taser 

1983
01:22:27,121 --> 01:22:27,954
in his hand.
If a person takes a police officer's 

1984
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:35,280
weapon,
police are obligated to use lethal force

1985
01:22:35,281 --> 01:22:37,740
to stop them.
So if you look,

1986
01:22:37,830 --> 01:22:38,760
you just have to.
There's a,

1987
01:22:38,761 --> 01:22:41,220
there's a video,
there's a documentary about this.

1988
01:22:41,221 --> 01:22:43,470
It's called frame.
I forget the number,

1989
01:22:43,471 --> 01:22:45,960
I think it's three 94.
You might be able to find it,

1990
01:22:46,050 --> 01:22:46,883
Jamie.
But um,

1991
01:22:47,550 --> 01:22:49,260
and it's plausible.
It's not definite,

1992
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:50,040
but this is what happened.

1993
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:51,840
But it is plausible if you look the way 
the,

1994
01:22:51,841 --> 01:22:54,970
where the cop was looking,
he may not have seen that,

1995
01:22:55,130 --> 01:22:55,963
that the Taser was on the ground.
I'm super confused because I thought 

1996
01:22:58,231 --> 01:22:59,640
that the cough drop,
hold on,

1997
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:00,290
I'm not venting.
Listen,

1998
01:23:00,290 --> 01:23:01,170
let me finish.
So he's like,

1999
01:23:01,190 --> 01:23:03,330
so Scott running away 20 yard shots in 
the back.

2000
01:23:03,690 --> 01:23:07,090
Then the cop walks over to him during 
that time.

2001
01:23:07,091 --> 01:23:09,760
He does see that the tasers on the 
ground next to him,

2002
01:23:09,761 --> 01:23:11,500
next to the cop,
he picks up the Taser.

2003
01:23:11,501 --> 01:23:15,940
The cop does walks over and drops it on 
the ground next to Scott momentarily and

2004
01:23:15,941 --> 01:23:18,380
then picks it back up.
Uh,

2005
01:23:18,430 --> 01:23:21,310
so who knows what was going on there.
He,

2006
01:23:21,910 --> 01:23:24,340
he may have been insured,
he may have been trying to cover himself

2007
01:23:24,341 --> 01:23:27,370
in that moment,
but actually he didn't need to that cop.

2008
01:23:27,430 --> 01:23:28,720
You know what happened with that trial?

2009
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:30,460
It's a hung jury.
He's,

2010
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:35,480
he's free because of this,
because I'm sure we don't know for sure,

2011
01:23:35,711 --> 01:23:38,920
but I know that this was the argument 
made by by the cops lawyer,

2012
01:23:39,430 --> 01:23:44,430
was that it is totally reasonable to 
assume that he believed he was.

2013
01:23:44,591 --> 01:23:49,591
He had reason to shoot him legally.
So that's one part of that story,

2014
01:23:49,930 --> 01:23:52,360
right?
Which is that the law is the problem.

2015
01:23:52,690 --> 01:23:53,523
Okay.
Not The cops stopped focusing on that 

2016
01:23:55,631 --> 01:23:56,890
copy.
You'll never find out.

2017
01:23:56,891 --> 01:23:59,290
You'll never be able to prove that he 
did it because he's a racist.

2018
01:23:59,291 --> 01:24:00,990
And even if we did,
what's that going to give two?

2019
01:24:01,030 --> 01:24:01,863
What's that going to get us?
That's not going to save anybody the 

2020
01:24:03,371 --> 01:24:04,600
next time this happens.
Right,

2021
01:24:05,110 --> 01:24:06,550
but what will save people's.
If we,

2022
01:24:06,790 --> 01:24:07,623
if we change those laws,
here's the worst law that really made 

2023
01:24:10,151 --> 01:24:12,880
the whole thing happened in the first 
place that no one's talking about.

2024
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:16,030
The whole thing started when Scott was 
driving through North Charleston,

2025
01:24:16,031 --> 01:24:18,070
right?
The Cop,

2026
01:24:18,071 --> 01:24:20,770
I think it was a suspended license plate
or something,

2027
01:24:20,771 --> 01:24:22,540
or a tail light tail light.
I think it was taillight.

2028
01:24:22,570 --> 01:24:25,180
Something trivial pulls them over.
At that time,

2029
01:24:25,181 --> 01:24:27,910
Scott was in arrears on child support 
payments.

2030
01:24:28,810 --> 01:24:29,643
Right,
and you go to.

2031
01:24:29,860 --> 01:24:31,430
Here we go.
You go to prison if you.

2032
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:33,370
If you get behind on your child support 
payments,

2033
01:24:33,430 --> 01:24:34,263
and he had been,
I think put in jail a few times in his 

2034
01:24:35,741 --> 01:24:36,574
life for this.
You get put in prison and there's a 

2035
01:24:39,611 --> 01:24:43,270
whole bunch of men right now as we speak
in prison for that very reason,

2036
01:24:43,990 --> 01:24:45,940
and these child support payments by the 
way,

2037
01:24:45,941 --> 01:24:50,941
are set by judges often in a system that
read that massively favors the women,

2038
01:24:53,230 --> 01:24:55,300
the mothers.
That whole system.

2039
01:24:55,450 --> 01:24:56,560
You've never been divorced,
right?

2040
01:24:57,010 --> 01:24:58,390
I have.
You know,

2041
01:24:58,391 --> 01:24:59,224
as soon as you enter it,
you see right away that the whole thing 

2042
01:25:01,511 --> 01:25:03,700
is stacked against us and it's,
this is,

2043
01:25:03,730 --> 01:25:05,440
you know,
it's just,

2044
01:25:05,490 --> 01:25:07,270
you look into it,
if you don't believe me,

2045
01:25:07,940 --> 01:25:11,980
you have to basically nine friends and I
went through the mildest divorce.

2046
01:25:11,980 --> 01:25:16,030
I mean my ex wife was as,
as easy on me as you could be,

2047
01:25:16,510 --> 01:25:17,343
but nonetheless I ended up paying a lot 
more child support than she really 

2048
01:25:19,331 --> 01:25:22,270
deserved and very.
But not a lot.

2049
01:25:22,271 --> 01:25:24,190
I mean,
but it was a lot of men.

2050
01:25:24,210 --> 01:25:24,611
Oh.
In fact,

2051
01:25:24,611 --> 01:25:26,350
you do have a friend just happened to I 
think,

2052
01:25:26,351 --> 01:25:27,184
right?
Yeah.

2053
01:25:27,190 --> 01:25:28,023
Yeah.
You go into these courtrooms and it's 

2054
01:25:29,201 --> 01:25:30,034
basically down to a judge as to a friend
who has to pay alimony for the rest of 

2055
01:25:32,081 --> 01:25:32,914
his life.
Yeah.

2056
01:25:33,010 --> 01:25:35,740
He was married for 12 years.
He's been divorced for 14.

2057
01:25:36,010 --> 01:25:39,340
He still has to pay his ex wife.
He's married to a new woman.

2058
01:25:39,341 --> 01:25:41,320
He has a new family.
He didn't even have kids with.

2059
01:25:41,321 --> 01:25:43,480
This woman has to pay her forever.
Yeah,

2060
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:44,353
forever.
Imagine if.

2061
01:25:44,950 --> 01:25:47,050
Imagine if they had kids.
He fucked her so hard.

2062
01:25:47,051 --> 01:25:51,040
She can't work anymore forever.
How about that?

2063
01:25:51,490 --> 01:25:53,090
That's a crazy little lot to say about 
that,

2064
01:25:53,091 --> 01:25:53,924
but yeah.
Uh,

2065
01:25:54,010 --> 01:25:54,843
but uh,
that's a crazy law when they have 

2066
01:25:55,751 --> 01:25:57,190
windows kids involved.
Right?

2067
01:25:57,210 --> 01:25:59,770
Forget about it.
That's a very sexist law by the way,

2068
01:25:59,950 --> 01:26:02,980
because that law is implying that this 
woman is incapable of making it on her.

2069
01:26:03,170 --> 01:26:04,070
Thank you.
By

2070
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:05,690
definition,
it's antifeminist.

2071
01:26:05,691 --> 01:26:06,524
Yes.
It's antifeminist and it's sexist and 

2072
01:26:07,731 --> 01:26:10,190
it's patriarchal.
It's totally patriarchal.

2073
01:26:10,191 --> 01:26:13,190
Women who support it,
they're supporting it because they don't

2074
01:26:13,191 --> 01:26:15,320
like men.
I mean that literally what it is,

2075
01:26:15,321 --> 01:26:16,210
what it is,
who knows?

2076
01:26:16,220 --> 01:26:18,050
I don't know about listening.
If you're supporting a woman,

2077
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:19,033
never having to work again because she 
married a guy for a certain amount of 

2078
01:26:21,051 --> 01:26:23,570
time,
like relationships come and go.

2079
01:26:23,571 --> 01:26:25,910
People get tired of each other.
People have the right to change.

2080
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:26,953
You shouldn't be financially obligated 
to take care of someone for the rest of 

2081
01:26:29,031 --> 01:26:32,060
their life just because you were married
at one point in time.

2082
01:26:32,061 --> 01:26:33,620
That's crazy.
Completely agree with you.

2083
01:26:33,621 --> 01:26:37,400
Especially in today's Day and age where 
my friend is 54,

2084
01:26:37,401 --> 01:26:40,310
I think he is now.
He could live to be 100,

2085
01:26:40,490 --> 01:26:41,323
so what the fuck?
He's got to pay for her for another 46 

2086
01:26:43,431 --> 01:26:43,730
years.

2087
01:26:43,730 --> 01:26:45,350
That's insanity.
Phenomenal.

2088
01:26:45,380 --> 01:26:45,921
Yeah,
but again,

2089
01:26:45,921 --> 01:26:47,810
when you that I agree with you 
completely,

2090
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:51,230
but what you said just then about it 
being sexist,

2091
01:26:51,260 --> 01:26:52,093
it is.
That's a radical concept that hasn't 

2092
01:26:55,131 --> 01:26:55,964
even,
I think registered with most people and 

2093
01:26:57,451 --> 01:26:58,284
if many people heard it,
they would think you are a sexist 

2094
01:26:59,811 --> 01:27:01,430
yourself for saying it,
but you know what?

2095
01:27:01,431 --> 01:27:04,880
It is inescapable that that's what's 
going on.

2096
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:08,860
That sexism against men is very common.
It's sexism against women too.

2097
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:11,660
That's what we're also sending them.
That's the radical part of this,

2098
01:27:11,690 --> 01:27:12,523
right?
It's actually patriarchal in the most 

2099
01:27:14,211 --> 01:27:15,044
fundamental sense,
which is that the court is saying that 

2100
01:27:17,841 --> 01:27:20,090
the man should be the provider.
I'm going to tell you a story.

2101
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:23,780
There's a woman in Florida who is a bit 
in my act and I'm doing now.

2102
01:27:23,781 --> 01:27:26,390
It's a true story.
There's a woman in Florida was a cop.

2103
01:27:26,390 --> 01:27:27,223
She was 25 years old.
She pretended to be a high school 

2104
01:27:29,211 --> 01:27:33,410
student and she's attractive woman,
made friends with this boy.

2105
01:27:33,411 --> 01:27:36,980
He thought it was his girlfriend and she
talked him into selling her pot and then

2106
01:27:36,981 --> 01:27:37,814
she arrested him.
That only works when you have a 17 year 

2107
01:27:42,021 --> 01:27:42,854
old boy and a 25 year old woman.
If you had a 25 year old man throwing 

2108
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:48,050
dick,
your 17 year old daughter,

2109
01:27:48,051 --> 01:27:51,920
and then he gets her to sell him pot and
then he arrests her.

2110
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:55,910
There would be people lining the fucking
street with torches to kill that guy,

2111
01:27:56,450 --> 01:27:57,283
but people are sexist against boys.
They feel that boys should just keep it 

2112
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:00,524
in his pants,
that boys should know better and you 

2113
01:28:02,091 --> 01:28:04,490
know as well as I know when you're 17 
years old,

2114
01:28:04,610 --> 01:28:05,443
you are baffled bag of hormones with a 
boner just running through the world 

2115
01:28:10,641 --> 01:28:11,474
trying to figure out what the fuck's 
going on and you're 12 months away from 

2116
01:28:13,311 --> 01:28:14,144
being an adult.

2117
01:28:14,180 --> 01:28:17,060
It's chaos.
It's craziness to end to think that this

2118
01:28:17,061 --> 01:28:17,894
young boy should be able to think 
clearly in that moment while there's 25 

2119
01:28:21,711 --> 01:28:24,170
year old woman has manipulating them is 
insane,

2120
01:28:24,530 --> 01:28:28,220
but they allowed it and this kid has a 
felony on his fucking record right now.

2121
01:28:28,270 --> 01:28:29,480
Yup.
This is,

2122
01:28:29,510 --> 01:28:33,890
this is the root of the issue with 
feminism.

2123
01:28:33,891 --> 01:28:36,440
That is current feminism in its current 
incarnation.

2124
01:28:36,441 --> 01:28:39,200
I am a feminist by the way.
How dare you can define the lead.

2125
01:28:39,230 --> 01:28:40,340
Now's her.
Uh,

2126
01:28:40,550 --> 01:28:43,660
but I will just be an egalitarian.
Yeah.

2127
01:28:43,690 --> 01:28:44,900
So.
Well,

2128
01:28:45,590 --> 01:28:48,740
that's okay.
I'm not that either.

2129
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:50,530
I'm not a nigger Alterian,
but um,

2130
01:28:50,630 --> 01:28:51,480
you're not.
No.

2131
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:52,191
Oh,
hold on.

2132
01:28:52,191 --> 01:28:53,080
Too many topics.
I'm like,

2133
01:28:53,540 --> 01:28:54,373
Jesus Christ,
we go off a lot of branches here and I 

2134
01:28:57,021 --> 01:28:57,854
love it.
Um,

2135
01:28:58,430 --> 01:28:59,121
where was I going?
Oh,

2136
01:28:59,121 --> 01:29:01,100
this family.
What you did was you identified,

2137
01:29:01,110 --> 01:29:01,960
and I think actually we,

2138
01:29:02,050 --> 01:29:03,570
I talked about this the first time I was
here,

2139
01:29:03,571 --> 01:29:04,980
which is,
that know this is what's,

2140
01:29:04,981 --> 01:29:05,814
to me at the heart of this is the 
appalling irony at the heart of 

2141
01:29:11,641 --> 01:29:15,240
contemporary feminism as practiced by 
self-defined feminists.

2142
01:29:15,270 --> 01:29:16,350
Okay.
Many,

2143
01:29:16,380 --> 01:29:18,190
not all guys.
I'm not generally,

2144
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:19,830
I'm not saying all feminists are like 
this,

2145
01:29:19,831 --> 01:29:22,500
but I'd say it's certainly,
it's the dominant strain right now,

2146
01:29:22,980 --> 01:29:26,130
which is that it is at its heart 
patriarchal,

2147
01:29:26,580 --> 01:29:31,080
which it treats women as vulnerable,
weak,

2148
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:32,333
powerless,
or incapable of making their own way in 

2149
01:29:34,531 --> 01:29:38,400
this world.
And it treats men as the not just forget

2150
01:29:38,401 --> 01:29:40,200
about the men,
forget about how they treat men.

2151
01:29:40,770 --> 01:29:43,200
It's how they treat women.
That's sexist.

2152
01:29:43,230 --> 01:29:47,430
It says that they need protection from 
the state,

2153
01:29:47,850 --> 01:29:48,683
which is run by usually men,
but it's also this other institution or 

2154
01:29:51,751 --> 01:29:55,050
you know,
college presidents need to protect these

2155
01:29:55,051 --> 01:29:58,200
women from 19 year old boys.
You want to have sex with them.

2156
01:29:58,290 --> 01:29:59,123
Same thing.
They're constantly calling for women to 

2157
01:30:00,961 --> 01:30:04,920
be protected by these institutions.
The state by men,

2158
01:30:05,340 --> 01:30:07,660
it is patriarchal and sexist right at 
the,

2159
01:30:07,710 --> 01:30:08,543
at the heart of it.
And same thing with family court and 

2160
01:30:11,071 --> 01:30:13,350
divorce law and all that stuff.
That's how they get treated.

2161
01:30:13,351 --> 01:30:18,351
They get treated like they're the ones 
who need to be taken care of by a man.

2162
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:20,850
It is.
It's like 19 fifties.

2163
01:30:21,150 --> 01:30:23,640
Sexism.
It's like madmen sexism.

2164
01:30:23,730 --> 01:30:24,563
That's what.
That's what most feminists are calling 

2165
01:30:26,101 --> 01:30:26,934
for now.

2166
01:30:27,020 --> 01:30:27,853
Well,
I disagree when you're talking about 

2167
01:30:28,581 --> 01:30:31,070
child rearing because I think that

2168
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:33,570
child support is,

2169
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:37,400
should be absolutely mandatory and it's 
very important.

2170
01:30:37,401 --> 01:30:40,970
And if a woman is the only one raising 
the kids on her own,

2171
01:30:41,180 --> 01:30:43,940
not only does she need the money for 
food and housing,

2172
01:30:43,941 --> 01:30:47,150
but also probably for someone to babysit
her kids.

2173
01:30:47,151 --> 01:30:49,550
There's a lot of factors involved and 
totally agree.

2174
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:53,120
And if the man's not in the scene like 
yeah,

2175
01:30:53,121 --> 01:30:55,910
he owes money for sure.
He has a responsibility.

2176
01:30:56,210 --> 01:31:00,260
And as a father,
at the very least that's what you should

2177
01:31:00,261 --> 01:31:02,720
be doing is contributing financially.
I totally agree.

2178
01:31:03,020 --> 01:31:04,970
I totally agree.
I'm not opposed to paying child support.

2179
01:31:05,060 --> 01:31:07,700
Alimony.
Alimony is weird.

2180
01:31:07,701 --> 01:31:08,720
Yeah,
that makes no sense at all.

2181
01:31:08,750 --> 01:31:09,501
It's weird.
Well,

2182
01:31:09,501 --> 01:31:10,334
it's.
I don't think it's a bad thing if 

2183
01:31:11,451 --> 01:31:13,190
someone like say,
how about this?

2184
01:31:13,340 --> 01:31:14,173
Say let's turn around.
Say you had a wife who was wealthy and 

2185
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:19,753
she was taking care of you while you're 
going through school and she promised 

2186
01:31:23,241 --> 01:31:27,320
that she was going to fund you all the 
way through your phd program.

2187
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:28,153
She was going to give you money so you 
didn't have to worry about anything but 

2188
01:31:29,541 --> 01:31:30,374
your education.
And then once you got out then you guys 

2189
01:31:32,241 --> 01:31:34,850
could share income.
But somewhere along the way,

2190
01:31:34,851 --> 01:31:37,580
she decided she was done with you and 
then you're fucked.

2191
01:31:37,581 --> 01:31:39,530
But during the middle of this program 
that you have to pay for,

2192
01:31:39,770 --> 01:31:44,300
I don't think it's unreasonable to say 
that she should give you until you could

2193
01:31:44,301 --> 01:31:48,740
figure your own system out so you don't 
have to quit your phd program and go get

2194
01:31:48,741 --> 01:31:51,860
a job somewhere and get an apartment and
a car.

2195
01:31:52,010 --> 01:31:53,870
I don't think that's.
That's it.

2196
01:31:54,190 --> 01:31:55,023
I don't think that's unreasonable.
What's unreasonable is saying that 

2197
01:31:57,441 --> 01:31:59,650
because you guys were together for a 
amount of time,

2198
01:31:59,740 --> 01:32:00,040
she has

2199
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:01,720
to pay you for the rest of your life.
Sure.

2200
01:32:01,810 --> 01:32:03,090
That's insanity.
Sure.

2201
01:32:03,130 --> 01:32:04,240
And that's current.
I agree.

2202
01:32:04,270 --> 01:32:06,310
That's real.
I agree that's a sexist.

2203
01:32:06,340 --> 01:32:08,980
But should that be legal though?
So that'd be legally enforced.

2204
01:32:09,010 --> 01:32:14,010
Should courts be deciding how long the 
alimony is paid and that's.

2205
01:32:15,380 --> 01:32:17,200
I don't know.
How has that happened?

2206
01:32:17,201 --> 01:32:18,034
Like what?
What's the motivation behind that for 

2207
01:32:19,631 --> 01:32:22,660
the courts to succumb to give in and 
just explain it to you?

2208
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:23,553
It's sexism,
it's patriarchy and the feminists are 

2209
01:32:25,660 --> 01:32:27,070
playing along with it.
That's it.

2210
01:32:27,340 --> 01:32:28,173
It's this.
Yeah.

2211
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:30,360
It's this idea that women can't make 
words though,

2212
01:32:30,620 --> 01:32:31,453
isn't the courts,
aren't there a lot of men involved in 

2213
01:32:33,071 --> 01:32:34,140
those courts do.
I mean,

2214
01:32:34,150 --> 01:32:34,983
why are they allowing all this stuff and
most of them think basically like 

2215
01:32:37,421 --> 01:32:38,254
feminists or at least they.
They are expected to behave and make 

2216
01:32:40,241 --> 01:32:41,074
decisions like feminist feminism has 
become dominant in that way in our 

2217
01:32:43,691 --> 01:32:45,370
culture going on for decades.

2218
01:32:46,030 --> 01:32:48,820
Laws have existed long before feminism 
and so prevalent.

2219
01:32:49,150 --> 01:32:50,800
That's my point.
It went from sexism,

2220
01:32:50,830 --> 01:32:52,300
patriarchy,
those laws.

2221
01:32:52,330 --> 01:32:53,163
Oh,
I see what you're saying.

2222
01:32:53,380 --> 01:32:56,200
So feminism is basically continuing that
stuff in.

2223
01:32:56,201 --> 01:32:59,560
It's Nagy back on it.
And switching up the definition,

2224
01:32:59,561 --> 01:33:00,394
let me say really loud and clear.
There have always been feminists who 

2225
01:33:04,151 --> 01:33:07,480
hate this stuff as much as you and I do.
Camille Paglia.

2226
01:33:08,660 --> 01:33:09,493
Okay.
And they have been loud and clear about 

2227
01:33:11,651 --> 01:33:12,760
this for a long,
long time.

2228
01:33:12,761 --> 01:33:14,800
And I love them and they're my heroes 
and I've learned from them.

2229
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:16,690
This is,
I've learned these things from them.

2230
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:21,700
Okay.
But the ones who really are powerful and

2231
01:33:21,701 --> 01:33:22,534
dominant in the media,
the ones we hear from the public 

2232
01:33:23,861 --> 01:33:25,330
intellectuals,
the academics,

2233
01:33:25,730 --> 01:33:26,563
government leaders,
the people who end up in the White 

2234
01:33:29,890 --> 01:33:30,700
House,
you know,

2235
01:33:30,700 --> 01:33:31,533
Obama's staff in hhs,
health and Human Services and the 

2236
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:35,913
Department of Education became very 
clear to me that all these sexual 

2237
01:33:37,571 --> 01:33:40,360
assault laws and rules that came out of 
there,

2238
01:33:40,810 --> 01:33:41,643
they were,
they were coming right out of colleges 

2239
01:33:42,850 --> 01:33:44,230
and they were really have that.

2240
01:33:44,290 --> 01:33:46,870
They were of the sort of college 
feminist movement.

2241
01:33:47,260 --> 01:33:51,310
They were the ones who sent that letter 
in 2011 that made it basically mandatory

2242
01:33:51,490 --> 01:33:54,040
for colleges to set up these kangaroo 
courts for sexual abuse,

2243
01:33:54,070 --> 01:33:56,230
sexual assault cases.
All the nonsense.

2244
01:33:56,231 --> 01:33:57,670
You and I talked about a couple years 
ago.

2245
01:33:57,671 --> 01:33:58,820
Yeah.
Um,

2246
01:33:58,990 --> 01:33:59,740
yeah,
I go.

2247
01:33:59,740 --> 01:34:03,910
Anybody interested in review those or 
earlier podcast about your college?

2248
01:34:03,970 --> 01:34:05,060
About oxide?
Yeah.

2249
01:34:05,220 --> 01:34:06,600
As many colleges.
But you know,

2250
01:34:06,610 --> 01:34:07,750
there's a whole backlash now,
right?

2251
01:34:07,751 --> 01:34:08,584
There's a huge.
It's all turning back and I knew it was 

2252
01:34:09,471 --> 01:34:13,180
going to happen.
Now they are completely being decimated.

2253
01:34:13,181 --> 01:34:14,014
There's hundreds,
maybe even thousands of men who are 

2254
01:34:15,371 --> 01:34:16,204
suing in court and many of them are 
winning right now for good reason 

2255
01:34:18,641 --> 01:34:21,340
because there was no due process because
they weren't allowed to,

2256
01:34:21,341 --> 01:34:23,110
you know,
ask questions.

2257
01:34:23,180 --> 01:34:24,013
That poor boy the mattress boy with that
girl put a mattress on her back and 

2258
01:34:28,610 --> 01:34:33,610
drags around campus and then took her 
graduation speech with a mattress.

2259
01:34:34,030 --> 01:34:35,530
They live.
Went on stage with a mattress.

2260
01:34:35,531 --> 01:34:37,210
I mean,
the whole thing was so fucking crazy.

2261
01:34:37,270 --> 01:34:38,780
Oh yeah.
My uh,

2262
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:39,993
yeah.
There's this fantastic sex worker 

2263
01:34:41,111 --> 01:34:43,660
activist named Christine Pereira,
who's in Vegas.

2264
01:34:44,140 --> 01:34:46,930
She said she tweeted something like,
when that happened,

2265
01:34:46,931 --> 01:34:47,920
he said,
fuck you,

2266
01:34:47,921 --> 01:34:48,754
mattress girl.
For those of us who have really been 

2267
01:34:49,751 --> 01:34:51,550
raped,
you're a fucking disgrace.

2268
01:34:52,390 --> 01:34:53,710
She went off.
It was something like that.

2269
01:34:53,711 --> 01:34:54,544
Yeah.
And it was.

2270
01:34:54,700 --> 01:34:57,350
That girl seems pretty crazy.
That mattress girl.

2271
01:34:57,351 --> 01:34:58,250
Yeah.
That was an extreme

2272
01:34:58,250 --> 01:35:01,070
example of them boys suing that school 
there also.

2273
01:35:01,071 --> 01:35:05,420
And many of them are winning and I don't
know what happened in those cases.

2274
01:35:05,421 --> 01:35:07,370
I don't even know what happened to 
mattress girl for sure.

2275
01:35:07,430 --> 01:35:08,263
For sure.
I know that there's all kinds of 

2276
01:35:08,691 --> 01:35:11,520
evidence that sure looks like it didn't 
happen the way she said it.

2277
01:35:11,630 --> 01:35:14,840
Didn't know for sure and I never will.
We will never know.

2278
01:35:14,870 --> 01:35:17,540
You can't know,
but what we do know for absolute sure is

2279
01:35:17,541 --> 01:35:21,410
that there's been terrible or no due 
process in those cases.

2280
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:22,700
Right.
And so that's the problem.

2281
01:35:22,701 --> 01:35:27,230
I mean that basically the accuser gets 
to win every time.

2282
01:35:27,260 --> 01:35:29,780
Imagine if that was our legal system 
writ large.

2283
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:31,220
Right.
Jo,

2284
01:35:31,370 --> 01:35:33,190
you stole a million dollars from 
yesterday.

2285
01:35:33,240 --> 01:35:34,073
All right.
Put Him in jail.

2286
01:35:34,240 --> 01:35:35,990
That's basically what's happening.
Exactly.

2287
01:35:35,991 --> 01:35:36,824
Okay.
Yeah.

2288
01:35:37,180 --> 01:35:39,680
Well,
I mean it got so crazy that even rolling

2289
01:35:39,681 --> 01:35:40,514
stone printed a false rape case that 
that gang rape case and Uva k 

2290
01:35:45,001 --> 01:35:45,834
astonishing,
which is just how did a company that's 

2291
01:35:48,591 --> 01:35:52,730
been in the journalism business,
as long as they've been,

2292
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:54,350
how did they fuck that up?

2293
01:35:54,380 --> 01:35:55,213
Yeah.
That was.

2294
01:35:55,370 --> 01:35:56,203
That was the turning point.
I think when that came out that it was 

2295
01:35:57,711 --> 01:35:58,544
completely made up.
I think since then it started to turn 

2296
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:05,660
something that's good that things like 
that happen so that you realize why it's

2297
01:36:05,661 --> 01:36:07,460
important to have checks and balances 
and that people.

2298
01:36:07,461 --> 01:36:08,294
It reaffirms this idea of real 
journalism is important to have your 

2299
01:36:12,021 --> 01:36:17,021
facts in order to have checks and double
check things and make sure you know what

2300
01:36:17,391 --> 01:36:19,490
the fuck you're printing.
I think it's good for society.

2301
01:36:19,491 --> 01:36:23,090
I think it's terrible for John Doe all 
the John Doe's out there,

2302
01:36:23,150 --> 01:36:23,983
all those men who were accused and 
expelled and had their names ruined and 

2303
01:36:26,481 --> 01:36:27,314
their careers ruined.
College careers destroyed and all that 

2304
01:36:29,541 --> 01:36:30,071
stuff,
right?

2305
01:36:30,071 --> 01:36:31,220
I think,
but yes,

2306
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:32,960
you're also,
even if you're exonerated,

2307
01:36:32,990 --> 01:36:35,060
the emotional turmoil that you go 
through,

2308
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:37,190
there's no way they can reward you for 
that.

2309
01:36:37,430 --> 01:36:39,170
There are compensate you for that 
rather.

2310
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:41,510
So that.
But that is part of that whole thing,

2311
01:36:41,511 --> 01:36:42,344
as I said before,
is part of this sort of ironic feminist 

2312
01:36:46,580 --> 01:36:48,860
patriarchy ideology.
Right?

2313
01:36:48,861 --> 01:36:49,694
Which is,
you know,

2314
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:51,350
we need protection.
We can't,

2315
01:36:52,010 --> 01:36:56,270
we can't because we can't say no to men.
We can't stop them by saying,

2316
01:36:56,271 --> 01:36:57,021
no,
we need,

2317
01:36:57,021 --> 01:36:58,700
you know,
w w we need help.

2318
01:36:58,701 --> 01:36:59,920
Just there,
we need to,

2319
01:37:00,030 --> 01:37:03,080
we need the college president to save us
or the cops or someone.

2320
01:37:03,081 --> 01:37:04,070
It's,
it's an incredible,

2321
01:37:04,730 --> 01:37:05,563
um,
well then there's this also this thing 

2322
01:37:07,011 --> 01:37:11,000
where two people are drinking and if two
people are drinking,

2323
01:37:11,030 --> 01:37:12,680
the girl is getting raped,
but there you go.

2324
01:37:12,870 --> 01:37:13,703
Same thing guys not getting ready 
because women are incapable of 

2325
01:37:16,341 --> 01:37:17,990
controlling themselves when they're 
drunk.

2326
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:20,130
Sexist as hell.
Exactly.

2327
01:37:20,131 --> 01:37:21,950
Because the man's drunk too,
but it doesn't.

2328
01:37:22,020 --> 01:37:23,330
Somehow or another,
it doesn't matter.

2329
01:37:23,331 --> 01:37:25,910
Even if they're both like sending texts 
back and forth.

2330
01:37:25,911 --> 01:37:27,860
Do you have condoms?
Like the Occidental case,

2331
01:37:27,890 --> 01:37:30,590
patriarchal women,
our children,

2332
01:37:30,620 --> 01:37:33,050
their daughters going to be taken care 
of by dad.

2333
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:34,780
And the sons are men.
Yeah.

2334
01:37:35,150 --> 01:37:37,190
Even though they're just same age.
And they're boys.

2335
01:37:37,370 --> 01:37:37,970
Yeah.
Yeah.

2336
01:37:37,970 --> 01:37:39,050
They have full agency.
Yeah.

2337
01:37:39,490 --> 01:37:41,900
And the women.
The women are daughters.

2338
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:43,010
Yeah,
it is sexist.

2339
01:37:43,011 --> 01:37:44,060
It's incredible.
Yeah.

2340
01:37:44,210 --> 01:37:45,350
So,
um,

2341
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:46,620
so okay.
Gender,

2342
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:47,800
Jordan Peterson.
I'm,

2343
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:51,320
so,
I'm completely absolutely with him.

2344
01:37:51,740 --> 01:37:52,970
You know,
when it comes to that,

2345
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,740
when it comes to policing of language 
and.

2346
01:37:56,760 --> 01:37:59,190
But he,
as I said,

2347
01:37:59,480 --> 01:38:00,313
I,
I,

2348
01:38:00,410 --> 01:38:01,243
I could be wrong about this,
but it sounded to me and I've listened 

2349
01:38:02,761 --> 01:38:03,594
to him on your show and I've listed them
elsewhere and a lot of people have 

2350
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:07,073
pointed him to me and vice versa because
they think we agree on these things and 

2351
01:38:09,331 --> 01:38:12,480
we don't,
which is that he thinks seems to me that

2352
01:38:12,481 --> 01:38:15,870
gender is biologically determined that 
there are two genders,

2353
01:38:15,871 --> 01:38:16,704
they're fixed in nature and that's the 
end of that discussion off he's ever 

2354
01:38:18,691 --> 01:38:19,590
said that.
And I don't,

2355
01:38:19,620 --> 01:38:21,500
I really don't think he has.
Yeah.

2356
01:38:22,490 --> 01:38:23,323
Well thank you.
Said that when it comes to gender 

2357
01:38:25,291 --> 01:38:26,124
identity,
that he doesn't believe that we need 

2358
01:38:27,301 --> 01:38:30,720
more pronouns and so he thinks it's just
wrong.

2359
01:38:30,750 --> 01:38:33,390
If you think you're a woman when you 
were born with a penis,

2360
01:38:33,570 --> 01:38:36,060
it's just by.
It's just sort of absolutely wrong.

2361
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:39,090
I think you would have to find him 
saying that before.

2362
01:38:39,150 --> 01:38:41,880
I'm really glad to hear you say that 
because I wasn't sure where you stood on

2363
01:38:41,881 --> 01:38:42,541
that.
No,

2364
01:38:42,541 --> 01:38:44,490
I mean fuck man,
that's a big deal.

2365
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:48,450
I think that's a big deal.
It can get super weird when.

2366
01:38:48,660 --> 01:38:49,493
Okay.
How about Rachel Dolezal she identifies 

2367
01:38:52,151 --> 01:38:53,640
as being black?
Yeah.

2368
01:38:53,740 --> 01:38:56,550
Let's use transracial.
How do you feel about that?

2369
01:38:56,580 --> 01:38:57,540
I think she's correct.

2370
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:00,331
Not,
no,

2371
01:39:00,331 --> 01:39:01,164
hang on,
let me,

2372
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:02,070
let me,
uh,

2373
01:39:02,070 --> 01:39:06,240
let me tell you what correct means.
They're not in a,

2374
01:39:06,420 --> 01:39:08,400
not in an absolute way,
right?

2375
01:39:08,430 --> 01:39:13,430
Not a scientific objective way,
but it's just as true as anything else.

2376
01:39:14,910 --> 01:39:19,340
Meaning that because so race and here's 
where a,

2377
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:20,273
here's,
here comes Sam Harris now and I'm sure 

2378
01:39:21,361 --> 01:39:23,610
Jordan Peterson's in this boat to buy.
No,

2379
01:39:23,640 --> 01:39:24,473
Sam Harris's,
because I just heard him talking about 

2380
01:39:25,561 --> 01:39:29,130
this with Charles Murray.
He believes there's,

2381
01:39:29,190 --> 01:39:32,430
there are races of people.
He thinks that race is a real thing.

2382
01:39:32,431 --> 01:39:34,160
He's,
he's definitely subtle about it.

2383
01:39:34,180 --> 01:39:34,861
Nuanced.
He says,

2384
01:39:34,861 --> 01:39:35,694
you know,
it's the divisions between races in the 

2385
01:39:37,441 --> 01:39:38,760
lines are blurry and it,
you know,

2386
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:41,730
but he believes there's a biological 
basis to race.

2387
01:39:41,731 --> 01:39:45,300
He's very clear about that and that is 
to me,

2388
01:39:45,780 --> 01:39:46,613
absurd and completely unscientific and 
it's easily disprovable by according to 

2389
01:39:51,121 --> 01:39:53,190
his own standards and by scientific 
standards.

2390
01:39:53,340 --> 01:39:55,980
But you see a black guy from Kenya,
you see a white guy,

2391
01:39:56,010 --> 01:39:59,250
a Chinese guy from China.
What's the difference?

2392
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:00,450
No difference.
So here's,

2393
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:03,240
here's the answer you tell me.
Right?

2394
01:40:03,270 --> 01:40:04,890
Which is that.
So historically,

2395
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:09,660
the differences between them have 
changed that we people,

2396
01:40:09,661 --> 01:40:10,494
human beings have said different things 
have created different categories and 

2397
01:40:15,031 --> 01:40:20,010
filled those categories with different 
characteristics over the centuries.

2398
01:40:20,011 --> 01:40:22,030
Those have changed constantly.
Right?

2399
01:40:22,110 --> 01:40:24,900
And my first time I was on here,
we had a long discussion about what's in

2400
01:40:24,901 --> 01:40:29,901
my book renegade history on immigrants,
the Irish and the Italians and the Jews.

2401
01:40:30,181 --> 01:40:33,690
When they got here to the United States 
here and in Europe,

2402
01:40:34,020 --> 01:40:36,720
they were largely considered to be 
negroes.

2403
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:38,513
Right?
Right.

2404
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:40,350
And now there is.
Why does anybody.

2405
01:40:40,590 --> 01:40:41,423
Right.
So what are they at that time in the 

2406
01:40:44,221 --> 01:40:45,054
early 20th century,
it was not like when I say common 

2407
01:40:49,261 --> 01:40:51,450
belief,
I mean it was taught in schools.

2408
01:40:51,510 --> 01:40:53,010
The following taught at

2409
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:59,070
the following that Europeans were made 
up of three distinct races.

2410
01:41:00,160 --> 01:41:01,930
There were the nordics and northern 
Europe,

2411
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:06,730
the Alpines in central Europe and the 
Mediterranean and in southern Europe.

2412
01:41:07,150 --> 01:41:09,640
And they were very different 
biologically.

2413
01:41:10,030 --> 01:41:13,810
The nordics where rational,
intelligent,

2414
01:41:14,260 --> 01:41:15,093
disciplined.
They were the ones who made 

2415
01:41:16,541 --> 01:41:18,940
civilization.
They should run the country.

2416
01:41:19,540 --> 01:41:22,300
The alpines we're okay there could be 
decent farmers,

2417
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:23,673
but they're never going to do Algebra 
and they certainly can't run a 

2418
01:41:25,241 --> 01:41:29,230
government.
The mediterraneans were basically either

2419
01:41:29,290 --> 01:41:30,123
like negroes are really close and 
therefore should be slaves or just 

2420
01:41:33,881 --> 01:41:35,140
peasants.
That's why people,

2421
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:38,290
you know it.
You're telling me you're talking about a

2422
01:41:38,291 --> 01:41:39,780
long time ago.
No,

2423
01:41:39,790 --> 01:41:43,300
we're talking about a hundred years ago,
which historically holding your breath,

2424
01:41:44,160 --> 01:41:45,640
but you know,
you love ancient history.

2425
01:41:45,641 --> 01:41:47,200
I mean if you look at the whole sweep of
human history,

2426
01:41:47,201 --> 01:41:48,610
that's five minutes ago,
right?

2427
01:41:48,700 --> 01:41:49,180
It is.

2428
01:41:49,180 --> 01:41:53,110
But it's still a long time in terms of 
how we address it today,

2429
01:41:53,350 --> 01:41:55,240
but it will really address it today.
If you're looking at it.

2430
01:41:55,241 --> 01:41:56,510
Someone from China.
Oh,

2431
01:41:56,511 --> 01:41:58,990
you're looking at a dark black man from 
Kenya.

2432
01:41:59,020 --> 01:42:01,120
Yeah.
There's something different about them.

2433
01:42:01,150 --> 01:42:03,280
Do you think it's just melanin?
Sure.

2434
01:42:03,450 --> 01:42:04,840
That's the horse.
There's something different about them,

2435
01:42:05,050 --> 01:42:05,883
the many different things.
Where do you draw the line about around 

2436
01:42:08,081 --> 01:42:09,280
races though,
right?

2437
01:42:09,281 --> 01:42:11,920
So look at all the people in Kenya.
Okay.

2438
01:42:12,580 --> 01:42:16,690
Which ones are Kenyans and which ones 
are they all Kenyans and what makes them

2439
01:42:16,691 --> 01:42:19,510
Kenyan or are they all Africans?
Well,

2440
01:42:19,511 --> 01:42:22,450
you know,
you can do the all black right passed on

2441
01:42:22,451 --> 01:42:25,210
someone and find out where their origins
are.

2442
01:42:25,211 --> 01:42:28,300
You can find out how much Irish you have
in you so much.

2443
01:42:28,301 --> 01:42:29,560
South African,
you can me.

2444
01:42:29,561 --> 01:42:30,394
You can do all that.
You can go all the way back to your 

2445
01:42:32,081 --> 01:42:33,490
family lineage through jeans.

2446
01:42:33,490 --> 01:42:35,440
I get that total.
If you want to go all the way back.

2447
01:42:35,441 --> 01:42:36,880
We're all African.
Sure.

2448
01:42:36,970 --> 01:42:37,803
Well there you go.
That's another way to disprove this 

2449
01:42:39,011 --> 01:42:39,730
whole thing.
Right?

2450
01:42:39,730 --> 01:42:40,563
Right.
But it's disproving it because we in 

2451
01:42:41,921 --> 01:42:44,170
these proving it,
sorry,

2452
01:42:44,171 --> 01:42:47,560
that's a bad word to use.
Here it is calling it out as a fiction,

2453
01:42:48,160 --> 01:42:48,993
as a social construct,
which is that these lines have been 

2454
01:42:52,151 --> 01:42:52,984
drawn all the time in all kinds of 
different ways over the centuries by 

2455
01:42:58,331 --> 01:43:00,460
human beings who just look at all the 
people in the world.

2456
01:43:00,461 --> 01:43:01,294
They line up the 7 billion people,
right in their mind and they draw lines 

2457
01:43:04,691 --> 01:43:05,021
is say,
oh,

2458
01:43:05,021 --> 01:43:06,490
these people over here,
this side,

2459
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:08,410
those are the negroes.
And over here,

2460
01:43:08,411 --> 01:43:09,244
these are the mongoloid.
And over here these asiatics and over 

2461
01:43:11,051 --> 01:43:11,980
here,
these are the nordics.

2462
01:43:11,981 --> 01:43:15,640
And over here the areas and the Jews and
those change all the time.

2463
01:43:15,970 --> 01:43:18,790
But these are just categories we invent,
right?

2464
01:43:19,150 --> 01:43:21,430
So who's black?
Jimi Hendrix,

2465
01:43:21,431 --> 01:43:22,870
black.
Well,

2466
01:43:22,871 --> 01:43:26,050
Jimi Hendrix has a mixed background,
right?

2467
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:30,280
I mean it wasn't his mother white.
What's his race?

2468
01:43:30,370 --> 01:43:31,900
Is he black or white?
It's a good question.

2469
01:43:31,901 --> 01:43:32,880
There you go.
Got It.

2470
01:43:32,890 --> 01:43:33,641
A lot in them.
But.

2471
01:43:33,641 --> 01:43:34,474
So,
but there's a big difference between 

2472
01:43:35,621 --> 01:43:40,210
someone like Jimmy Hendrix and someone 
that is like very,

2473
01:43:40,211 --> 01:43:41,044
very dark,
comes from a specific part of the world 

2474
01:43:43,901 --> 01:43:45,970
where everyone around them is very,
very dark.

2475
01:43:45,971 --> 01:43:46,804
Let's do that,
are very obvious and repeatable 

2476
01:43:48,581 --> 01:43:49,810
characteristics.
Let's do that.

2477
01:43:49,811 --> 01:43:52,160
So Congo,
these come from Chicago,

2478
01:43:52,610 --> 01:43:53,550
okay?
The people there,

2479
01:43:53,700 --> 01:43:56,390
they're pygmies actually immigrants.
And even the staff room,

2480
01:43:56,680 --> 01:43:57,513
you know what we can do?
West Africans were slaves were the west 

2481
01:44:00,980 --> 01:44:03,020
where the western slaves,
American slaves come from.

2482
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:06,710
Um,
and just across the continent,

2483
01:44:06,711 --> 01:44:08,060
not even that far away.
You know,

2484
01:44:08,061 --> 01:44:10,790
there's Somalia,
Somalians look like,

2485
01:44:11,570 --> 01:44:11,960
right?

2486
01:44:11,960 --> 01:44:13,190
Yeah.
And Ethiopians,

2487
01:44:13,510 --> 01:44:14,343
right.
You think about them and how they look 

2488
01:44:15,050 --> 01:44:17,190
and think about how the,
uh,

2489
01:44:17,300 --> 01:44:21,870
west West Africans look.
Are they the same race will very,

2490
01:44:21,910 --> 01:44:23,690
very,
very characteristic,

2491
01:44:23,691 --> 01:44:24,524
very dark Somali.
Somalis looked different than everybody 

2492
01:44:27,170 --> 01:44:28,100
clearly.
Right.

2493
01:44:28,101 --> 01:44:29,870
You know,
as Somali immediately,

2494
01:44:29,930 --> 01:44:31,610
right?
Same continent,

2495
01:44:31,820 --> 01:44:35,110
same pigmentation basically.
Yeah.

2496
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:37,370
Other facial structured,
very different.

2497
01:44:38,180 --> 01:44:40,610
Why are they black?
Why are they the same race?

2498
01:44:40,670 --> 01:44:44,750
Is the question at the same race or.
I mean what I'm saying about Somalians,

2499
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:46,070
like would you,
would you,

2500
01:44:46,071 --> 01:44:46,904
would you consider Somalians the same as
like Ethiopians or as the same as 

2501
01:44:50,691 --> 01:44:52,610
Egyptian.
My thing is also Africa.

2502
01:44:52,640 --> 01:44:54,770
My thing is let's get rid of these 
categories.

2503
01:44:55,080 --> 01:44:57,620
There is,
these are all silly made up categories.

2504
01:44:57,830 --> 01:45:00,350
There's no reason to.
They're all arbitrary.

2505
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:01,393
Okay.
Lines have been drawn between groups of 

2506
01:45:03,681 --> 01:45:08,010
people arbitrarily over the centuries,
but what you see,

2507
01:45:08,030 --> 01:45:10,100
you're arguing against something that 
Sam Harris said.

2508
01:45:10,100 --> 01:45:12,380
So what did Sam Harris say specifically?
Not just him.

2509
01:45:12,381 --> 01:45:13,214
It's a lot of people,
but yeah.

2510
01:45:13,670 --> 01:45:16,490
So you don't agree that there is any 
race at all?

2511
01:45:16,610 --> 01:45:18,290
I'm just saying it's a fiction.
It's made,

2512
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:19,633
right?
It's just a.

2513
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:21,950
it's like is it a fiction or is it a 
way?

2514
01:45:21,951 --> 01:45:22,784
We're trying to define the variations 
between human groups because there are 

2515
01:45:26,871 --> 01:45:27,704
variations.
So that's definitely what it's been 

2516
01:45:29,721 --> 01:45:31,910
about.
That's definitely been the motivation.

2517
01:45:32,570 --> 01:45:33,403
Right.
And think about what the consequences 

2518
01:45:34,611 --> 01:45:36,020
have been.
Okay.

2519
01:45:36,021 --> 01:45:36,854
But it's never been good just because 
there's never glances for variations or 

2520
01:45:39,891 --> 01:45:40,724
recognizing variations doesn't mean you 
should stop recognizing actual 

2521
01:45:43,311 --> 01:45:44,570
variations,
but then you make.

2522
01:45:44,571 --> 01:45:46,340
But they always make claims right after 
that.

2523
01:45:46,370 --> 01:45:49,250
Like it doesn't have to what Sam Harris 
is Straw man,

2524
01:45:49,251 --> 01:45:50,084
isn't it?
I mean did you don't have to make a 

2525
01:45:50,781 --> 01:45:53,480
claim that Chinese people are different 
because they look different,

2526
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:54,753
but then it's just,
well this is what a Chinese person 

2527
01:45:56,850 --> 01:46:00,170
generally they have these very stringent
characteristics.

2528
01:46:00,170 --> 01:46:02,540
They don't have blonde hair,
they don't have blue eyes.

2529
01:46:02,770 --> 01:46:04,910
I'm not tall and skinny.
They look like Chinese.

2530
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:06,530
Sure.
But then again,

2531
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:10,040
Chinese people all look the same.
I mean there's to say that,

2532
01:46:10,220 --> 01:46:11,330
right?
But again,

2533
01:46:11,331 --> 01:46:12,164
with a clear characteristics,
the difference between a Chinese person 

2534
01:46:14,391 --> 01:46:17,230
and a black person is very clear.
Uh,

2535
01:46:17,720 --> 01:46:20,630
uh,
not really well and not always Kenyan.

2536
01:46:20,680 --> 01:46:21,513
So lives in Kenya who was born and 
raised multiple generations deep and 

2537
01:46:26,061 --> 01:46:28,280
their parents are canyon,
their grandparents at Kenyon.

2538
01:46:28,281 --> 01:46:32,270
There's a very big difference between 
them and someone who lives in Shanghai.

2539
01:46:32,390 --> 01:46:34,190
Yeah.
But who was born in Shanghai?

2540
01:46:34,191 --> 01:46:37,190
They're parents were born in Shanghai.
They'd go all the way back.

2541
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:39,650
Many,
many generations of being pure Chinese.

2542
01:46:39,680 --> 01:46:40,513
Right?
But there are infinite variations even 

2543
01:46:41,601 --> 01:46:43,790
among people who have lived only in 
Shanghai,

2544
01:46:43,820 --> 01:46:45,680
but what do you want to call the 
variations?

2545
01:46:45,681 --> 01:46:46,514
Nothing but,
but,

2546
01:46:46,520 --> 01:46:48,500
but you're talking about something 
that's clearly

2547
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:52,890
or you just ignore it.
I would say that there's,

2548
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:55,470
of course,
there are genes that run in families and

2549
01:46:55,471 --> 01:46:57,720
I completely agree that,
you know,

2550
01:46:57,721 --> 01:47:00,450
genes determine in large part how we 
look.

2551
01:47:00,660 --> 01:47:01,493
Fine.
So you can certainly say this person is 

2552
01:47:04,111 --> 01:47:07,070
likely because of their genes connected 
to that person,

2553
01:47:07,090 --> 01:47:08,970
last generation to that generation,
to this,

2554
01:47:09,220 --> 01:47:10,890
you know,
and his family lineage.

2555
01:47:10,891 --> 01:47:11,760
Sure.
Well,

2556
01:47:11,761 --> 01:47:13,350
what does that give you?
I don't know.

2557
01:47:13,380 --> 01:47:15,270
Nothing.
I mean it's.

2558
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:18,090
The thing is that people have taken that
and they've said,

2559
01:47:18,120 --> 01:47:18,953
oh,
well these particular characteristics 

2560
01:47:20,761 --> 01:47:21,594
are human beings.
We are talking about complexity and 

2561
01:47:22,441 --> 01:47:23,820
human beings at the beginning of this.
Right?

2562
01:47:24,390 --> 01:47:26,380
People are infinitely complex.
Right?

2563
01:47:26,430 --> 01:47:27,660
Okay.
So the thing is,

2564
01:47:27,690 --> 01:47:28,523
what people have done historically is 
they've just picked certain 

2565
01:47:32,010 --> 01:47:34,020
characteristics among people and said,
oh,

2566
01:47:34,021 --> 01:47:36,810
that is what determines your race is the
issue.

2567
01:47:36,811 --> 01:47:39,360
The word race is maybe the issue.

2568
01:47:39,420 --> 01:47:42,510
Like there are obvious physical 
characteristics.

2569
01:47:42,511 --> 01:47:46,620
The difference between someone who is a 
mon goal versus someone who,

2570
01:47:46,621 --> 01:47:49,350
uh,
is a Brazilian versus someone who is.

2571
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:54,500
There's some pretty obvious physical 
characteristics for geographic areas.

2572
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:55,793
What would you agree like,
or common physical characteristics for 

2573
01:47:58,231 --> 01:47:59,064
some geographic areas?
Or You could say on average people in 

2574
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:06,210
China are shorter than people in 
Polynesia.

2575
01:48:06,270 --> 01:48:07,530
Well,
here's the place where you could do it.

2576
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:08,940
Canada,
like,

2577
01:48:09,060 --> 01:48:09,893
try to find a Canadian.
Like you don't know what a Canadian 

2578
01:48:11,401 --> 01:48:13,170
looks like.
They could be English,

2579
01:48:13,171 --> 01:48:15,870
they could be American,
they could was trying to entertain.

2580
01:48:15,871 --> 01:48:17,520
You're your strongest argument.
Okay.

2581
01:48:17,521 --> 01:48:19,160
So like China,
right?

2582
01:48:19,250 --> 01:48:22,470
You can certainly say that people in 
China are on average,

2583
01:48:22,500 --> 01:48:24,480
on average,
shorter than people in Polynesia.

2584
01:48:24,720 --> 01:48:26,190
Right?
Will they look different?

2585
01:48:26,910 --> 01:48:27,743
Whatever.
That's one way in which they look 

2586
01:48:28,691 --> 01:48:29,524
different.
Right.

2587
01:48:29,640 --> 01:48:31,850
Facial talking about physiognomy facial 
feature.

2588
01:48:31,850 --> 01:48:32,683
That bone structure.
Polynesians find to be like really 

2589
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:38,040
stout.
I suppose you could say,

2590
01:48:38,041 --> 01:48:38,910
you know,
the,

2591
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:43,080
the width of their eyes is narrower or 
whatever on average and whatever.

2592
01:48:43,081 --> 01:48:43,590
Sure.
Okay.

2593
01:48:43,590 --> 01:48:46,250
Okay.
So what is it?

2594
01:48:46,490 --> 01:48:47,280
I mean,
what did we.

2595
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:48,120
Okay.
So they,

2596
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:52,710
they are likely to be in lineage from 
that part of the world.

2597
01:48:53,190 --> 01:48:54,630
Fine.
That's cool.

2598
01:48:54,720 --> 01:48:57,090
I've got no problem with that.
But what else do you want to say?

2599
01:48:57,450 --> 01:48:58,650
The thing is,
Joe,

2600
01:48:58,710 --> 01:49:01,800
no one stops there.
They always go on to that.

2601
01:49:02,130 --> 01:49:05,250
They always go on from there and they 
start to make all these other claims.

2602
01:49:05,310 --> 01:49:08,640
Oh well that race is really good at 
math.

2603
01:49:09,030 --> 01:49:11,490
Their Iq is higher.
This is what actually Sam Harrison,

2604
01:49:11,491 --> 01:49:14,910
Charles Murray were just saying,
they can do the,

2605
01:49:14,940 --> 01:49:16,050
they can do the,
um,

2606
01:49:16,110 --> 01:49:18,780
they can do the coding for Google better
than,

2607
01:49:18,930 --> 01:49:20,430
than other people can,
whatever,

2608
01:49:20,431 --> 01:49:20,670
right?

2609
01:49:20,670 --> 01:49:23,280
They are more,
they are more scrupulous.

2610
01:49:23,310 --> 01:49:25,740
They smoked cigarettes more,
whatever it is,

2611
01:49:25,741 --> 01:49:26,574
you know,
they used to be accused of being a more 

2612
01:49:27,781 --> 01:49:29,880
easily addicted to opium,
you name it,

2613
01:49:29,940 --> 01:49:31,190
right.
Things changed,

2614
01:49:31,191 --> 01:49:34,080
but that's the problem is that once you 
start there,

2615
01:49:34,290 --> 01:49:39,290
people have used those differences for 
other reasons almost always,

2616
01:49:40,230 --> 01:49:45,230
which are nefarious and injurious and 
you have done terrible things to people.

2617
01:49:45,810 --> 01:49:46,643
Your problem is recognizing those 
characteristics and those differences 

2618
01:49:50,351 --> 01:49:51,184
and calling it a race and then attaching
all sorts of other claims to this 

2619
01:49:56,081 --> 01:49:57,190
category.
Precisely.

2620
01:49:57,620 --> 01:49:58,453
Yeah.
That's exactly what Sam and Charles 

2621
01:50:00,340 --> 01:50:01,720
Murray,
this is Charles Murray's thing,

2622
01:50:01,721 --> 01:50:02,554
although it's actually,
it's only a small part of his work and 

2623
01:50:04,511 --> 01:50:07,000
he gets accused of it being central and 
it's not.

2624
01:50:07,001 --> 01:50:07,834
But anyway,
he does still nonetheless believed this 

2625
01:50:09,401 --> 01:50:10,234
and so to Sam Harris and so did other 
people that there are differences in Iq 

2626
01:50:15,820 --> 01:50:16,810
among races.

2627
01:50:17,020 --> 01:50:19,690
Okay.
Now on the surface level,

2628
01:50:19,691 --> 01:50:22,570
they are completely correct.
There's no question,

2629
01:50:22,690 --> 01:50:23,523
meaning that Iq scores among people that
we identify as African American have 

2630
01:50:32,951 --> 01:50:37,951
been lower than among the people we 
define as white American.

2631
01:50:38,530 --> 01:50:41,110
Totally true,
totally true,

2632
01:50:41,111 --> 01:50:42,970
and they are right that that is 
suppressed,

2633
01:50:43,120 --> 01:50:45,460
that we are not allowed to even talk 
about that data,

2634
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:47,770
which is there and it's.
I have no problem with that.

2635
01:50:47,771 --> 01:50:50,440
I'm sure that's true.
Here's the thing though.

2636
01:50:51,100 --> 01:50:55,240
How do we define African American and 
how do we define white first?

2637
01:50:55,241 --> 01:50:57,280
That's the first problem.
Those,

2638
01:50:57,281 --> 01:51:00,250
as you know,
definitions have changed over time,

2639
01:51:00,580 --> 01:51:01,413
so Jews used to be in the African 
American group and Italians used to be 

2640
01:51:04,151 --> 01:51:05,980
in the African American group was.
No,

2641
01:51:05,990 --> 01:51:06,610
no,
never,

2642
01:51:06,610 --> 01:51:08,770
never called African Americans.
They were,

2643
01:51:08,771 --> 01:51:10,200
they were called negroes.
Yes,

2644
01:51:10,220 --> 01:51:12,080
they were.
Shoes were called negroes.

2645
01:51:12,090 --> 01:51:15,910
A book written is in my book renegade 
history in ninth in 1911,

2646
01:51:15,911 --> 01:51:18,340
there was a book written by a scholar 
and this was one of many,

2647
01:51:18,790 --> 01:51:21,910
the title of which his name was Arthur 
abernethy.

2648
01:51:22,300 --> 01:51:25,300
The title of which was the Jew is a 
negro.

2649
01:51:25,900 --> 01:51:28,880
That's the title of it was common.
This is what pieces,

2650
01:51:28,930 --> 01:51:29,763
what year this is.
This is all through the late 19th and 

2651
01:51:31,901 --> 01:51:32,734
early 20th centuries from about the 18 
eighties when the Jews started coming 

2652
01:51:34,451 --> 01:51:37,840
over and big numbers from the 18 
eighties until the 19 forties.

2653
01:51:38,770 --> 01:51:39,460
This was,
I'm not,

2654
01:51:39,460 --> 01:51:40,293
I'm saying this is what was taught in 
college classrooms that Jews were of a 

2655
01:51:44,951 --> 01:51:48,850
different race and there was some 
difference of opinion about whether they

2656
01:51:48,851 --> 01:51:52,660
were black or whether they were just 
some other kind of inferior race,

2657
01:51:52,661 --> 01:51:55,210
but they certainly weren't white.
That was,

2658
01:51:55,270 --> 01:51:58,990
that was widely agreed upon until world 
war two basically.

2659
01:51:59,530 --> 01:52:02,700
All right,
so how do we define African-american?

2660
01:52:02,890 --> 01:52:04,410
Is Jimi Hendrix,
African-american?

2661
01:52:04,430 --> 01:52:05,251
Does he,
you're talking to.

2662
01:52:05,251 --> 01:52:08,440
There's a big difference,
isn't there in the term African American

2663
01:52:08,441 --> 01:52:10,060
versus Negro,
right.

2664
01:52:10,090 --> 01:52:12,130
Because like it's the same thing.

2665
01:52:12,130 --> 01:52:13,660
It's just a different name for the same 
category.

2666
01:52:13,661 --> 01:52:15,160
Yeah.
But it's from Africa.

2667
01:52:15,161 --> 01:52:17,500
They knew that these Jews weren't from 
Africa.

2668
01:52:17,501 --> 01:52:20,090
So the.
So the one drop system continent,

2669
01:52:20,270 --> 01:52:21,103
I don't know.
They believe that they believe that the 

2670
01:52:22,421 --> 01:52:24,880
genes and the right about this.
Right.

2671
01:52:24,881 --> 01:52:26,930
That the genes come from Florida.
Yeah,

2672
01:52:27,790 --> 01:52:28,420
so that's,
you know,

2673
01:52:28,420 --> 01:52:30,370
and they're bright but so do all of our 
genes.

2674
01:52:30,371 --> 01:52:31,070
Right,
right.

2675
01:52:31,070 --> 01:52:33,460
Um,
so that was part of their claim and that

2676
01:52:33,461 --> 01:52:34,390
they were from,
you know,

2677
01:52:34,720 --> 01:52:38,830
part of Europe that was a bit closer to 
Africanism when they said about Italians

2678
01:52:38,831 --> 01:52:40,030
in particular,
Sicilians,

2679
01:52:40,031 --> 01:52:40,530
right.
They're like,

2680
01:52:40,530 --> 01:52:41,680
Hey,
look where it is.

2681
01:52:41,740 --> 01:52:44,730
That's why these people are fucking all 
the time and having babies.

2682
01:52:44,940 --> 01:52:48,290
True and are lazy and can't work and 
fight in the bars and get drunk and.

2683
01:52:48,950 --> 01:52:49,783
Right,
right.

2684
01:52:49,790 --> 01:52:52,100
So,
so how do we define these terms?

2685
01:52:52,101 --> 01:52:54,140
What is white men that's totally 
changed,

2686
01:52:54,141 --> 01:52:55,140
but how much of it is great?

2687
01:52:55,190 --> 01:52:56,870
They realize just how much of it is 
cultural.

2688
01:52:56,871 --> 01:53:00,230
So there's that hold on and then,
and then I acu.

2689
01:53:01,010 --> 01:53:02,690
Well,
um,

2690
01:53:03,050 --> 01:53:04,970
I think it does measure something.
I think that's real.

2691
01:53:04,971 --> 01:53:05,930
I do,
I really do.

2692
01:53:05,990 --> 01:53:07,880
I think there was something called the g
factor,

2693
01:53:07,881 --> 01:53:08,740
which it,
it,

2694
01:53:08,830 --> 01:53:10,310
it,
it tests,

2695
01:53:10,311 --> 01:53:12,770
it measures g factors,
this thing that was invented,

2696
01:53:12,771 --> 01:53:14,450
this concept,
it's a category,

2697
01:53:14,451 --> 01:53:16,820
but it's a real category in the world we
operate in,

2698
01:53:16,821 --> 01:53:19,850
which is your ability to do rational 
thinking,

2699
01:53:19,851 --> 01:53:24,851
reasoning like math,
like writing scholarly essays,

2700
01:53:25,310 --> 01:53:26,143
you know,
I'm sure my g factor is higher sort of 

2701
01:53:29,960 --> 01:53:32,330
than other people's,
although I'm terrible at math.

2702
01:53:32,331 --> 01:53:35,210
So that's yet another problematic 
wrinkle for these people.

2703
01:53:35,960 --> 01:53:37,160
Um,
but yeah,

2704
01:53:37,161 --> 01:53:41,030
I,
I believe that Iq measures that stuff,

2705
01:53:41,210 --> 01:53:42,043
that kind of thing.
But is that what intelligence is and 

2706
01:53:44,901 --> 01:53:48,050
only as clearly.
No,

2707
01:53:48,120 --> 01:53:48,953
no,
no.

2708
01:53:48,970 --> 01:53:50,850
A lot of variables that Iq test,
test,

2709
01:53:51,170 --> 01:53:52,130
test,
test,

2710
01:53:52,160 --> 01:53:54,110
write the tests,
all kinds of intelligence.

2711
01:53:54,160 --> 01:53:54,993
The test emotional intelligence.
Do they test the intelligence of Jimi 

2712
01:53:58,370 --> 01:54:00,110
Hendrix?
Do you think he was great at Calculus?

2713
01:54:00,111 --> 01:54:01,340
I don't know.
I sort of doubt it.

2714
01:54:01,370 --> 01:54:05,690
Was He smart?
Was the intelligent clearly in different

2715
01:54:05,691 --> 01:54:07,010
ones.
Clever with a guitar,

2716
01:54:07,011 --> 01:54:09,410
that's for sure.
So then how do you define intelligence?

2717
01:54:10,370 --> 01:54:11,203
Activity is unquestionably some sort of 
measurement or expression of 

2718
01:54:14,391 --> 01:54:16,670
intelligence.
We separate that off though,

2719
01:54:16,760 --> 01:54:18,890
and we always have as a society,
we shouldn't.

2720
01:54:18,980 --> 01:54:22,070
That's why you don't do well unless 
you're really,

2721
01:54:22,071 --> 01:54:22,904
really,
really good if you're just creative in 

2722
01:54:24,471 --> 01:54:25,304
the way we define that and not 
intelligent in the way Iq tests to find 

2723
01:54:29,061 --> 01:54:31,130
it.
There's a.

2724
01:54:31,430 --> 01:54:34,220
So it's all problematic.
Um,

2725
01:54:34,640 --> 01:54:35,473
and it just,
it all it does is it just keeps raising 

2726
01:54:37,791 --> 01:54:40,610
new questions that never has answers.
And so that the attempt to.

2727
01:54:41,120 --> 01:54:45,320
There's this thing that goes on where 
certain people just need to keep finding

2728
01:54:45,740 --> 01:54:48,740
racial differences that are innate,
biological,

2729
01:54:48,741 --> 01:54:50,300
fixed that can't be changed.

2730
01:54:50,300 --> 01:54:51,500
And it's like,
first of all,

2731
01:54:51,501 --> 01:54:54,890
you've never done this because it's so 
fluid and you're always,

2732
01:54:54,891 --> 01:54:57,410
you never really answering it.
And then what if you had,

2733
01:54:57,411 --> 01:54:58,244
did finally prove it?
What are we going to do with that 

2734
01:55:00,500 --> 01:55:02,260
information?
You know,

2735
01:55:02,300 --> 01:55:04,370
we just recognize that there are 
variables.

2736
01:55:04,371 --> 01:55:06,500
Like when you're talking about 
Polynesian people,

2737
01:55:06,650 --> 01:55:09,170
are we talking about people from Tonga?
Very stout,

2738
01:55:09,171 --> 01:55:12,220
strong people,
samoans tend to be very stout,

2739
01:55:12,260 --> 01:55:13,820
strong people.
I mean,

2740
01:55:13,821 --> 01:55:14,654
that's a characteristic of actually a 
positive characteristic that's 

2741
01:55:17,991 --> 01:55:20,720
attributed to people from that area.
Do you ignore that?

2742
01:55:20,721 --> 01:55:22,460
Like how do you address that?
Of course not.

2743
01:55:22,470 --> 01:55:25,310
I would say that people from Polynesia 
are more likely.

2744
01:55:25,311 --> 01:55:30,110
Men from Polynesia are more likely to be
offensive lineman in the NFL.

2745
01:55:30,170 --> 01:55:33,220
So your issue is calling it a itself.
Yeah.

2746
01:55:33,410 --> 01:55:34,243
And then attributing other things to it.
All I'm saying is guys from there tend 

2747
01:55:37,461 --> 01:55:38,160
to be bigger.

2748
01:55:38,160 --> 01:55:38,750
Yeah.
Hell yeah.

2749
01:55:38,750 --> 01:55:39,980
No doubt about it.
But so what?

2750
01:55:40,040 --> 01:55:40,873
That's the end of it.
Is there a part of the world where 

2751
01:55:42,531 --> 01:55:46,140
people are generally thought to be dumb?
Yeah.

2752
01:55:46,141 --> 01:55:48,230
Africa,
the country that are that.

2753
01:55:48,290 --> 01:55:50,380
The continent we've been talking about 
that,

2754
01:55:50,460 --> 01:55:53,190
that's the history of this country.
Does the history of Europe,

2755
01:55:53,220 --> 01:55:54,053
that's the history of the modern world 
is the belief that people from Africa 

2756
01:55:56,971 --> 01:55:58,440
are dumber than whites.
Well,

2757
01:55:58,480 --> 01:55:59,313
isn't the problem with that?
That Africa is also where the pyramids 

2758
01:56:01,261 --> 01:56:02,970
were created.
That's what justified.

2759
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,640
That's what justified slavery.
That's what justified colonialism.

2760
01:56:05,641 --> 01:56:08,010
That's what justifies has justified all 
sorts of things.

2761
01:56:08,011 --> 01:56:08,844
Right.
So that's the problem here is that 

2762
01:56:10,201 --> 01:56:11,034
these,
these attempts to define people by race 

2763
01:56:13,980 --> 01:56:15,240
and by the way,
by gender,

2764
01:56:15,540 --> 01:56:16,373
have done nothing but terrible things.
Nothing but terrible things and you 

2765
01:56:20,011 --> 01:56:22,620
can't do it anyway.
It's scientific bullshit.

2766
01:56:22,621 --> 01:56:25,140
It's total superstition is utterly 
arbitrary.

2767
01:56:25,320 --> 01:56:28,410
The lines are always being redrawn by 
the people who do this stuff,

2768
01:56:28,680 --> 01:56:29,513
so why are you still doing it guys?
Like it's where do you draw the Goddamn 

2769
01:56:32,250 --> 01:56:34,890
line?
All the people in Africa are black.

2770
01:56:35,100 --> 01:56:35,933
Really?
Egyptians are the same race as people 

2771
01:56:38,101 --> 01:56:43,101
from the Congo as the people from South 
Africa as the people from Somalia.

2772
01:56:43,470 --> 01:56:45,300
I mean,
how are they the same race?

2773
01:56:45,480 --> 01:56:48,990
Because it's pigment skin pigment is 
that the only determination will.

2774
01:56:48,991 --> 01:56:49,824
It's a fascinating thing when you call 
people African Americans or call them a 

2775
01:56:54,270 --> 01:56:56,310
Italian Americans because Italy is 
actually a country.

2776
01:56:56,311 --> 01:56:58,800
Whereas Africa is a continent.
Fantastic.

2777
01:56:58,801 --> 01:57:01,580
It's,
it's weird to call people conduit,

2778
01:57:02,640 --> 01:57:04,080
right?
Because guess what?

2779
01:57:04,140 --> 01:57:06,630
Italy didn't even exist until the 19th 
century.

2780
01:57:07,500 --> 01:57:08,333
I mean it was just a bunch of city 
states until then and there was no such 

2781
01:57:10,771 --> 01:57:11,604
thing as an Italian.
People who lived there didn't call 

2782
01:57:13,471 --> 01:57:14,790
themselves.
It wasn't a concept,

2783
01:57:14,791 --> 01:57:15,360
it wasn't a name.

2784
01:57:15,360 --> 01:57:16,193
It was nothing.
And then they made it into this nation 

2785
01:57:18,901 --> 01:57:20,850
state that they called Italy and then 
ever since,

2786
01:57:20,851 --> 01:57:23,550
ever since then,
every sorry,

2787
01:57:23,551 --> 01:57:26,230
but every dipshit Italian American is 
like really proud of that.

2788
01:57:26,240 --> 01:57:27,073
I'm Italian.
Well that dude that has no meaning 

2789
01:57:28,561 --> 01:57:31,440
really in the deepest history at a some 
weight meaning sure.

2790
01:57:31,441 --> 01:57:34,350
But they talk about it as if it's like 
rooted in nature.

2791
01:57:34,351 --> 01:57:35,184
Like I love it.
They love being a part of that stupid 

2792
01:57:37,171 --> 01:57:38,760
team.
Sopranos,

2793
01:57:39,170 --> 01:57:40,860
the Sopranos.
It's tribalism,

2794
01:57:41,390 --> 01:57:43,410
tribalism.
It is tribal and stupid.

2795
01:57:43,590 --> 01:57:45,780
And if it were just stupid,
I wouldn't care.

2796
01:57:46,320 --> 01:57:47,370
It's that.
It has,

2797
01:57:47,430 --> 01:57:49,830
as I said,
it just leads to bad stuff.

2798
01:57:49,890 --> 01:57:52,710
And it has historically,
let's go this popular opinion,

2799
01:57:52,730 --> 01:57:54,870
the,
the idea that there are no races.

2800
01:57:55,020 --> 01:57:55,980
Oh,
okay.

2801
01:57:56,010 --> 01:57:57,060
So,
you know,

2802
01:57:57,480 --> 01:57:58,313
Mr. Anti academic academic.
But this is where academics have 

2803
01:58:00,781 --> 01:58:01,860
actually done their best work.

2804
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:03,990
I think so,
and this is the second,

2805
01:58:04,050 --> 01:58:05,880
my second disagreement with Jordan 
Peterson.

2806
01:58:06,660 --> 01:58:11,040
He thinks that all this stuff and 
college campuses that's crazy is because

2807
01:58:11,041 --> 01:58:14,730
of postmodernism and he doesn't 
understand postmodernism.

2808
01:58:15,650 --> 01:58:16,483
Uh,
the,

2809
01:58:16,550 --> 01:58:17,383
what's going on in college campuses as 
people making all sorts of truth claims 

2810
01:58:20,460 --> 01:58:22,170
about things like race and gender,
right?

2811
01:58:22,650 --> 01:58:25,830
I'm black,
therefore I will always be this,

2812
01:58:25,831 --> 01:58:26,551
that,
and the other thing.

2813
01:58:26,551 --> 01:58:28,440
You're white,
therefore you are this,

2814
01:58:28,441 --> 01:58:29,131
that,
and the other thing.

2815
01:58:29,131 --> 01:58:30,120
No matter what,
right?

2816
01:58:30,990 --> 01:58:35,990
That is actually old modernist 
scientific racist thinking.

2817
01:58:37,200 --> 01:58:41,470
That's what these old racist geneticists
eugenesis thought back in the day.

2818
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:43,060
It's amazing.
Again,

2819
01:58:43,061 --> 01:58:43,894
sjws are actually really,
really conservative and ultimately 

2820
01:58:46,841 --> 01:58:48,970
racist.
The Social Justice Warriors folks,

2821
01:58:50,040 --> 01:58:50,873
your listeners must know that something,
I don't know the assume that was a 

2822
01:58:53,410 --> 01:58:57,130
shorthand to use.
So postmodernism.

2823
01:58:57,520 --> 01:58:58,353
This is where Jordan Jordan Peterson 
makes me want to like throw chairs when 

2824
01:59:00,131 --> 01:59:02,070
he talks about,
um,

2825
01:59:02,410 --> 01:59:05,620
comes out of French philosophy,
uh,

2826
01:59:05,621 --> 01:59:07,720
in the 19 sixties and seventies and 
eighties.

2827
01:59:07,780 --> 01:59:10,580
Michel Foucault is the most famous 
example of a,

2828
01:59:10,680 --> 01:59:14,680
of a French postmodernist and he,
they get dumped on all the time,

2829
01:59:15,220 --> 01:59:16,053
but the central,
the central argument that was made by 

2830
01:59:19,511 --> 01:59:20,344
food co and postmodernists was that none
of these things are biologically 

2831
01:59:27,491 --> 01:59:31,180
determined that there is no natural 
essence to anything.

2832
01:59:31,690 --> 01:59:32,523
That everything is a social construct,
which means that we now are free to 

2833
01:59:38,801 --> 01:59:42,580
choose our own destiny as individuals.
Right?

2834
01:59:43,270 --> 01:59:46,300
Prior to that,
prior to the 19 sixties and seventies,

2835
01:59:47,350 --> 01:59:51,850
it was the dominant belief that if you 
were born a woman,

2836
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:56,140
you are going to be a wife and a mother,
and if you weren't,

2837
01:59:56,141 --> 01:59:58,000
you were doing something unnatural,
right?

2838
01:59:58,640 --> 01:59:59,473
That if you were black,
you could never be the head of a 

2839
02:00:02,171 --> 02:00:04,090
business or the president,
right?

2840
02:00:04,091 --> 02:00:05,770
You could never do math,
whatever.

2841
02:00:06,640 --> 02:00:08,260
If you were white,
you know,

2842
02:00:08,290 --> 02:00:10,420
you should do all those things,
right?

2843
02:00:10,630 --> 02:00:15,190
Everybody's destiny was determined at 
birth and everyone believed that.

2844
02:00:15,370 --> 02:00:17,070
Most people believe that.
Okay,

2845
02:00:17,710 --> 02:00:19,500
so postmodernist came along and said,
guess what?

2846
02:00:19,540 --> 02:00:20,373
You know,
what we found looking at history we 

2847
02:00:21,551 --> 02:00:22,384
found is just what I said.
I just gave you the whole postmodern 

2848
02:00:24,700 --> 02:00:27,190
argument right there.
We looked at history and we saw first of

2849
02:00:27,191 --> 02:00:28,024
all,
that all of these categories have 

2850
02:00:28,301 --> 02:00:29,134
changed over time,
which tells us that they're just 

2851
02:00:31,091 --> 02:00:31,924
inventions.
They're just inventions that get 

2852
02:00:33,461 --> 02:00:35,390
reinvented all the time.
Okay?

2853
02:00:36,430 --> 02:00:37,263
And second of all,
they have served the purposes of ruling 

2854
02:00:39,851 --> 02:00:40,684
elites because they get to put people in
their boxes and control them more 

2855
02:00:43,781 --> 02:00:45,100
easily.
Right?

2856
02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:46,570
Oh,
those people over there,

2857
02:00:46,571 --> 02:00:49,780
those are black.
Therefore they should be our slaves.

2858
02:00:50,290 --> 02:00:52,030
So it's okay for us to have a mess.
Slaves,

2859
02:00:52,720 --> 02:00:54,610
those women over there,
we don't want them,

2860
02:00:54,930 --> 02:00:56,320
you know,
working for NASA.

2861
02:00:56,380 --> 02:00:59,290
So we will have a rule against women 
working for NASA.

2862
02:00:59,350 --> 02:01:00,340
Whatever it is,
right?

2863
02:01:00,940 --> 02:01:04,600
So postmodern has said,
none of this is biological.

2864
02:01:04,601 --> 02:01:05,434
None of this is inevitable.
You are now free to do what you want as 

2865
02:01:08,921 --> 02:01:11,470
an individual.
It was a liberating moment.

2866
02:01:12,040 --> 02:01:14,800
It has become the dominant way of 
thinking in academia.

2867
02:01:14,860 --> 02:01:16,480
And I have to say,
in my view,

2868
02:01:16,930 --> 02:01:20,950
it is the supreme achievement of 
academics ever.

2869
02:01:22,840 --> 02:01:23,920
That's it.
That's it.

2870
02:01:24,940 --> 02:01:26,590
But it's huge.
Huge.

2871
02:01:27,160 --> 02:01:27,993
So if you think about it,
look at how the world has changed 

2872
02:01:30,130 --> 02:01:31,930
particularly in that in the United 
States since then,

2873
02:01:31,931 --> 02:01:34,990
right?
We no longer generally have those ideas.

2874
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:35,833
At least we don't operate as such.
So black people are allowed mostly into 

2875
02:01:40,791 --> 02:01:41,624
places they weren't before.
Women are allowed very much so into 

2876
02:01:44,090 --> 02:01:44,923
places they weren't allowed before.
All the whole world has changed and I 

2877
02:01:48,111 --> 02:01:52,700
think principally from that idea,
so the trend,

2878
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:53,833
that doesn't mean now the problem is 
these social justice warriors so called 

2879
02:01:57,741 --> 02:01:58,574
on campuses,
have used some of that language and 

2880
02:02:02,600 --> 02:02:03,530
taking a shit on it.

2881
02:02:04,490 --> 02:02:08,240
So the Trans Movement,
for instance,

2882
02:02:08,241 --> 02:02:11,360
right?
That started from postmodernism.

2883
02:02:11,660 --> 02:02:12,800
That whole idea,
right,

2884
02:02:12,830 --> 02:02:13,641
is that,
you know,

2885
02:02:13,641 --> 02:02:17,060
if you were born with a penis,
you're a man and you should do x,

2886
02:02:17,061 --> 02:02:18,350
y,
and z with your life.

2887
02:02:18,640 --> 02:02:19,473
Right?
The Trans Movement needed that needed 

2888
02:02:21,891 --> 02:02:24,410
postmodernism to make that intervention 
and say,

2889
02:02:24,411 --> 02:02:25,340
no,
that's not true,

2890
02:02:25,400 --> 02:02:26,233
right?
You can actually be a woman because a 

2891
02:02:27,620 --> 02:02:29,960
woman is an invention.
It's a social construct.

2892
02:02:31,100 --> 02:02:33,800
What Trans,
much of the Trans Movement now is doing,

2893
02:02:33,801 --> 02:02:34,634
which makes me so sad,
is that they're saying that I am 

2894
02:02:39,080 --> 02:02:41,720
biologically essentially,
naturally,

2895
02:02:41,721 --> 02:02:42,980
you know,
in my core,

2896
02:02:43,100 --> 02:02:45,440
a woman,
no,

2897
02:02:45,560 --> 02:02:48,910
no one is,
no one is you can't change.

2898
02:02:49,190 --> 02:02:52,910
The whole point of this movement used to
be that you get to choose your gender or

2899
02:02:52,911 --> 02:02:55,430
choose not to be a gender.
You get to move around.

2900
02:02:55,670 --> 02:02:58,830
Your destiny is not determined for you 
what the true.

2901
02:02:58,880 --> 02:03:00,770
A lot of the Trans Movement now is 
doing.

2902
02:03:00,771 --> 02:03:02,480
This is a good word,
reifying.

2903
02:03:02,510 --> 02:03:05,150
They're making these ideas,
these abstractions real.

2904
02:03:05,180 --> 02:03:06,013
Again,
they're making these claims that are 

2905
02:03:07,881 --> 02:03:08,714
similar to Sam Harris has claims and to 
old racist claims and to old sexist 

2906
02:03:12,351 --> 02:03:14,870
claims that if you're born in a 
particular way,

2907
02:03:14,900 --> 02:03:18,690
biologically this is who you are,
right?

2908
02:03:18,740 --> 02:03:20,180
Because you've heard a lot of trans 
people say this,

2909
02:03:20,181 --> 02:03:21,740
right?
I was born a woman.

2910
02:03:23,680 --> 02:03:24,513
That's where they often say,
what I'm saying is no one was born 

2911
02:03:28,311 --> 02:03:29,144
anything.

2912
02:03:30,190 --> 02:03:33,810
You are losing me in a huge way.
Why you don't think that women,

2913
02:03:33,870 --> 02:03:37,320
that some women are born women and some 
you don't think you're born a man.

2914
02:03:37,350 --> 02:03:38,970
No.
What are you born?

2915
02:03:40,220 --> 02:03:42,900
Why you men?
For all sorts of reasons,

2916
02:03:42,930 --> 02:03:45,230
for all sorts of reasons.
None of them being just decided.

2917
02:03:45,250 --> 02:03:46,890
We.
None of them being the x,

2918
02:03:46,891 --> 02:03:49,140
y chromosome.
You have testicles.

2919
02:03:49,141 --> 02:03:49,974
Then we went to and you have a penis.
None of them being the fact that you 

2920
02:03:52,111 --> 02:03:55,350
generally gravitate towards male 
activities like boxing,

2921
02:03:55,590 --> 02:03:56,960
kickboxing,
and we just.

2922
02:03:57,260 --> 02:03:58,520
We just went through this whole thing.
No,

2923
02:03:58,521 --> 02:03:59,010
you didn't.
Well,

2924
02:03:59,010 --> 02:04:00,030
Romero and Andy.
Dick.

2925
02:04:00,060 --> 02:04:00,690
Yeah,
but yeah,

2926
02:04:00,690 --> 02:04:01,890
they both men.
But you.

2927
02:04:02,120 --> 02:04:03,800
You.
You're a man yet,

2928
02:04:03,990 --> 02:04:04,823
right?
We're not talking about the broad 

2929
02:04:05,461 --> 02:04:07,860
spectrum of masculine behavior.
We're talking about.

2930
02:04:07,861 --> 02:04:10,380
No one is born a man.
You're not born a man.

2931
02:04:10,381 --> 02:04:11,490
I'm not born.
And I'm saying,

2932
02:04:11,640 --> 02:04:13,140
no,
I think we're getting silly.

2933
02:04:13,230 --> 02:04:16,380
Hold on here.
I think it's the category of men becomes

2934
02:04:16,381 --> 02:04:18,120
meaningless.
Does it?

2935
02:04:18,180 --> 02:04:19,590
Yeah.
We just did this man.

2936
02:04:19,591 --> 02:04:20,400
No,
we didn't.

2937
02:04:20,400 --> 02:04:21,233
We didn't do well.
Romero and Andy Dick or put on category 

2938
02:04:24,600 --> 02:04:25,433
jewelry at the ends of the spectrum and 
I think they crossover the male female 

2939
02:04:29,851 --> 02:04:33,810
lines do cross over when you get to that
Kenyan runner and Andy Dick.

2940
02:04:33,830 --> 02:04:35,370
Yeah,
but that's what I'm saying.

2941
02:04:35,371 --> 02:04:38,850
It's so broad that it becomes,
to me pretty damn meaningless.

2942
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:41,280
Well,
the numbers are incredibly small.

2943
02:04:41,281 --> 02:04:43,440
If those crossover marks,
you're talking about us.

2944
02:04:43,500 --> 02:04:45,600
Very,
very small percentage of the population.

2945
02:04:45,620 --> 02:04:49,040
Neither Andy Dick nor you'll ell Ramiro 
are trans people,

2946
02:04:49,130 --> 02:04:49,963
right?

2947
02:04:50,300 --> 02:04:52,560
It might be.
They are so different though.

2948
02:04:52,590 --> 02:04:53,423
Physically in every way.
We both put them in this silly category 

2949
02:04:56,491 --> 02:04:56,851
called,
man,

2950
02:04:56,851 --> 02:04:59,160
what the hell is that mean anymore?
And he has children.

2951
02:04:59,161 --> 02:04:59,994
He made them mind,
impregnated different women and got 

2952
02:05:02,341 --> 02:05:05,220
babies from a lot of people called men 
who don't and can't.

2953
02:05:05,310 --> 02:05:06,330
Can't.
Okay.

2954
02:05:06,390 --> 02:05:07,890
Yeah,
but that's rare.

2955
02:05:07,910 --> 02:05:10,080
They were rare in that way,
but it's pretty rare.

2956
02:05:10,590 --> 02:05:11,570
Not that rare.
Oh,

2957
02:05:11,580 --> 02:05:14,340
it's very rare.
Most most men,

2958
02:05:14,400 --> 02:05:17,450
when they have sex with a woman and they
put sperm in their body,

2959
02:05:17,470 --> 02:05:19,890
they can one maybe.
So that's one characteristic,

2960
02:05:19,920 --> 02:05:20,880
but hold on a second,
you're,

2961
02:05:20,910 --> 02:05:21,420
you're,
you're,

2962
02:05:21,420 --> 02:05:22,253
you're making it as if it's a really 
common thing when you're talking about 

2963
02:05:24,961 --> 02:05:29,961
like a small fraction of the men can't 
make babies a incredibly small fraction.

2964
02:05:31,861 --> 02:05:35,130
So an incredibly vast majority of males 
with the x,

2965
02:05:35,131 --> 02:05:39,930
y chromosome who have penises are 
capable of impregnating a female with an

2966
02:05:39,931 --> 02:05:42,130
XX chromosome.
And the,

2967
02:05:42,150 --> 02:05:45,990
the male was born a male.
The female was born a female,

2968
02:05:46,260 --> 02:05:47,790
right?
So what do you mean?

2969
02:05:47,791 --> 02:05:50,730
But you aren't born a man or you aren't 
born a female.

2970
02:05:50,780 --> 02:05:51,890
Right?
So there are many,

2971
02:05:51,891 --> 02:05:53,240
many characteristics,
right?

2972
02:05:53,241 --> 02:05:56,090
That we assigned to the categories.
Many of them.

2973
02:05:56,630 --> 02:05:59,660
That's one characteristic.
Okay,

2974
02:05:59,930 --> 02:06:00,763
so why?
Why is that characteristic in the man 

2975
02:06:02,721 --> 02:06:05,300
category,
if in particular that there are some men

2976
02:06:05,301 --> 02:06:06,920
who don't share that character 
characteristic,

2977
02:06:07,210 --> 02:06:10,480
but which ones don't you?
That's the aberration.

2978
02:06:10,900 --> 02:06:11,733
The aberrations,
the one operation to see these are all 

2979
02:06:13,950 --> 02:06:15,220
images.
Get a woman pregnant.

2980
02:06:15,221 --> 02:06:17,350
They don't produce sperm.
You're talking about like very,

2981
02:06:17,351 --> 02:06:18,730
very rare cases.

2982
02:06:19,390 --> 02:06:21,520
Yeah,
same with center for race.

2983
02:06:21,521 --> 02:06:23,320
Same thing happens with sickle cell 
anemia,

2984
02:06:23,321 --> 02:06:24,790
right?
This is what everybody invokes when they

2985
02:06:24,910 --> 02:06:25,743
want to claim that race is real.
Only black people get sickle cell 

2986
02:06:28,421 --> 02:06:29,650
anemia.
Well guess what?

2987
02:06:29,710 --> 02:06:33,430
The numbers there are about the same as 
the number of men who are infertile.

2988
02:06:34,030 --> 02:06:36,370
Why then are people with sickle cell 
anemia?

2989
02:06:36,400 --> 02:06:37,750
Definitely black.
Why is that?

2990
02:06:37,751 --> 02:06:40,330
Definitely a black thing.
Same thing.

2991
02:06:40,660 --> 02:06:41,380
It's,
you know,

2992
02:06:41,380 --> 02:06:42,220
again,
why are we.

2993
02:06:42,380 --> 02:06:43,213
There's all these characteristics.
Why do we draw this line called man 

2994
02:06:47,170 --> 02:06:49,570
around all those different people?

2995
02:06:49,880 --> 02:06:51,380
Well,
why don't we do it with animals?

2996
02:06:51,410 --> 02:06:53,570
When you have a male dog and a female 
dog,

2997
02:06:53,571 --> 02:06:55,330
isn't there a male dog,
a female dog?

2998
02:06:55,350 --> 02:06:57,680
Eventually there's a male dog and he was
saying his inventions.

2999
02:06:57,681 --> 02:06:58,220
Now,
hold on,

3000
02:06:58,220 --> 02:07:00,980
so before you get,
but yeah,

3001
02:07:00,981 --> 02:07:01,401
no,
it is.

3002
02:07:01,401 --> 02:07:04,340
Of course it's not an invention.
One of them has a penis and testicles.

3003
02:07:04,350 --> 02:07:05,930
It's the thing we see.

3004
02:07:05,940 --> 02:07:07,290
We call it a penis.
Sure,

3005
02:07:07,291 --> 02:07:07,830
I get it.
No,

3006
02:07:07,830 --> 02:07:09,540
I get it.
And that's the world I live in.

3007
02:07:09,600 --> 02:07:11,880
Absolutely.
So I operate in this way,

3008
02:07:11,881 --> 02:07:12,330
by the way,
by the way.

3009
02:07:12,330 --> 02:07:13,163
So if a dog penis world,
you and I would agree on all the things 

3010
02:07:15,451 --> 02:07:17,570
in the world that are dogs right thing.
Okay,

3011
02:07:17,580 --> 02:07:18,340
I'm not,
I'm not gonna.

3012
02:07:18,340 --> 02:07:19,300
Walk around and be like,
oh no dude,

3013
02:07:19,310 --> 02:07:21,060
that's not a dog.
So with humans,

3014
02:07:21,061 --> 02:07:21,894
you're making a distinction that there 
are certain feelings and the way you 

3015
02:07:25,530 --> 02:07:29,580
interface with the world that may be 
more or less masculine or feminine,

3016
02:07:29,640 --> 02:07:31,650
but it does apply to dogs.
My point here,

3017
02:07:31,651 --> 02:07:34,160
which is that we did draw a line right 
in those.

3018
02:07:34,250 --> 02:07:36,100
There's this.
Do all dogs look alike?

3019
02:07:36,160 --> 02:07:37,600
My God,
there's a huge variation.

3020
02:07:37,601 --> 02:07:39,430
They're not talking about race though.
We're talking about gender,

3021
02:07:39,431 --> 02:07:40,241
right?
Either way,

3022
02:07:40,241 --> 02:07:41,800
it doesn't matter.
Same principle,

3023
02:07:41,801 --> 02:07:43,870
dobermans,
male Dobermans,

3024
02:07:43,871 --> 02:07:45,040
and female Dobermans,
right?

3025
02:07:45,070 --> 02:07:48,070
You can't.
If you go to buy a male Doberman and the

3026
02:07:48,071 --> 02:07:49,570
guy gives you a female dove men,
he goes,

3027
02:07:49,571 --> 02:07:51,250
oh,
but she identifies as being a male.

3028
02:07:51,490 --> 02:07:53,110
This.
It's just an invention,

3029
02:07:53,111 --> 02:07:54,070
man.
This is a male,

3030
02:07:54,100 --> 02:07:56,650
but she's a male.
You can't disrespect for by saying she's

3031
02:07:56,651 --> 02:07:57,850
not a male.
You would say,

3032
02:07:57,851 --> 02:07:59,800
that guy's crazy and you want your money
back.

3033
02:07:59,830 --> 02:08:02,350
Are there any two females who were 
identical to female?

3034
02:08:02,351 --> 02:08:03,430
What?
Anything?

3035
02:08:04,630 --> 02:08:07,210
I mean,
if you have a really good breeder,

3036
02:08:07,211 --> 02:08:09,520
you can get pretty God damn close.
If you're talking about dog.

3037
02:08:09,620 --> 02:08:10,453
No,
no,

3038
02:08:10,550 --> 02:08:13,840
there's no.
There are no two into organisms that are

3039
02:08:13,841 --> 02:08:14,674
identical.
Certainly not down to the hair on 

3040
02:08:17,820 --> 02:08:18,653
technicality,
but so you can still categorize them as 

3041
02:08:20,501 --> 02:08:21,334
x,
y,

3042
02:08:21,510 --> 02:08:22,343
x chromosomes,
and I'm not saying we shouldn't 

3043
02:08:23,921 --> 02:08:28,840
categorize anything ever because we must
do that to live in this world.

3044
02:08:28,990 --> 02:08:29,823
What are you saying?
What I am saying is we should probably 

3045
02:08:31,391 --> 02:08:36,391
stop applying certain categories to 
human beings in the ways we have done.

3046
02:08:37,560 --> 02:08:38,393
Like how so?
Because there were male and male and 

3047
02:08:40,121 --> 02:08:41,690
female,
because there are certain inventions,

3048
02:08:41,691 --> 02:08:45,220
certain social constructs that do 
nothing but bad things to do.

3049
02:08:45,220 --> 02:08:46,053
No good,
and their only social constructs like 

3050
02:08:48,730 --> 02:08:50,110
race and gender.
Well,

3051
02:08:50,111 --> 02:08:50,944
tell me how race and gender.
I'm not worried about Doberman gender 

3052
02:08:53,651 --> 02:08:55,750
definition.
Let's look at gender definition and tell

3053
02:08:55,751 --> 02:08:56,584
me how it's only bad.
Why is it only bad to find men as men 

3054
02:09:00,841 --> 02:09:02,770
and women is women?
Because if you say it's,

3055
02:09:02,800 --> 02:09:05,170
it's.
It's about making the biological claim,

3056
02:09:05,230 --> 02:09:06,063
the bright,
the biological connection there will 

3057
02:09:07,481 --> 02:09:10,990
making a definition which is saying a 
guy who was born,

3058
02:09:10,991 --> 02:09:14,380
a guy who gravitates towards male 
activities,

3059
02:09:14,381 --> 02:09:16,000
likes females,
all those things.

3060
02:09:16,001 --> 02:09:19,930
By saying that that's a man that this is
a born man and you're saying,

3061
02:09:19,931 --> 02:09:21,130
no,
no one is.

3062
02:09:21,640 --> 02:09:22,473
So if you're saying,
if those characteristics are naturally 

3063
02:09:23,711 --> 02:09:27,760
determined than all,
all of us guys who don't do those things

3064
02:09:27,761 --> 02:09:30,870
are unnatural.
Which things are those all the time?

3065
02:09:30,900 --> 02:09:31,733
All the things that women,
whatever it is that you characterize as 

3066
02:09:33,131 --> 02:09:33,964
being male,
that's so common with males and what is 

3067
02:09:37,930 --> 02:09:41,330
being attracted to women really aging 
and with women.

3068
02:09:42,070 --> 02:09:44,000
Have you heard of gay people?
Yes.

3069
02:09:44,080 --> 02:09:47,020
It's a small percentage of the 
population of men.

3070
02:09:47,730 --> 02:09:49,480
Um,
is it one percent?

3071
02:09:49,481 --> 02:09:51,880
Is Four percent?
I mean,

3072
02:09:51,881 --> 02:09:53,470
it's certainly a lot of people,
isn't it?

3073
02:09:53,710 --> 02:09:54,543
It's a lot of people.
When you think about the 350 million 

3074
02:09:56,921 --> 02:09:58,990
people we have living in America,
sure.

3075
02:09:59,080 --> 02:10:00,250
Take all them in.
Let's do this.

3076
02:10:00,280 --> 02:10:02,710
Take all the men who are straight up 
homosexual.

3077
02:10:02,711 --> 02:10:06,160
Always have to hold on,
but you can classify them as gay men.

3078
02:10:06,190 --> 02:10:06,820
I know.
Hold on.

3079
02:10:06,820 --> 02:10:08,080
So just take that.
Whatever that is,

3080
02:10:08,410 --> 02:10:10,120
if it's one or two or five or 10 
percent,

3081
02:10:10,121 --> 02:10:10,954
whatever it is,
I've only been homosexual hundred 

3082
02:10:12,220 --> 02:10:13,630
percent.
Never been attracted to a woman period.

3083
02:10:13,631 --> 02:10:14,464
Okay?
Okay,

3084
02:10:14,500 --> 02:10:16,150
fine.
That's still a really significant,

3085
02:10:16,151 --> 02:10:17,230
significant number.
I'm not done.

3086
02:10:17,231 --> 02:10:18,280
Hang on.
Then.

3087
02:10:18,281 --> 02:10:21,820
Take the men who don't identify as 
homosexual,

3088
02:10:21,910 --> 02:10:24,700
have had sex with women,
have been attracted to women,

3089
02:10:24,850 --> 02:10:27,040
but have fucked men prisoners.

3090
02:10:27,070 --> 02:10:28,830
Pretty Damn big number.
They're pretty dense.

3091
02:10:28,870 --> 02:10:29,590
Oh,
wait a minute.

3092
02:10:29,590 --> 02:10:33,560
How many guys do you think that are 
attracted to women but still fuck men?

3093
02:10:34,220 --> 02:10:35,900
So Kinsey,
the Kinsey study.

3094
02:10:35,950 --> 02:10:37,220
Sure.
The 19 forties and fifties.

3095
02:10:37,730 --> 02:10:39,920
Found that it was,
I think 30 percent.

3096
02:10:40,900 --> 02:10:42,530
Yes.
Thirty percent of men.

3097
02:10:42,531 --> 02:10:46,640
Fuck man reached orgasm in a sexual 
experience with another man.

3098
02:10:46,641 --> 02:10:48,110
Yes.
Thirty percent.

3099
02:10:48,140 --> 02:10:49,730
Yes.
Yes.

3100
02:10:49,820 --> 02:10:52,430
It was a very large number of was 
hanging out with freaks.

3101
02:10:52,460 --> 02:10:53,540
Yup.
That's what I think.

3102
02:10:53,570 --> 02:10:55,010
There were different numbers for women 
and men,

3103
02:10:55,011 --> 02:10:58,300
but they were both very significant.
Percentages vary.

3104
02:10:58,400 --> 02:11:00,990
Not Majority's,
but very significant percentage as well.

3105
02:11:01,120 --> 02:11:01,953
I have personally known.
I've personally known many men who you 

3106
02:11:05,241 --> 02:11:07,730
would consider straight,
who identify as straight,

3107
02:11:07,970 --> 02:11:11,150
who have done something with men,
either given him a blow job,

3108
02:11:11,151 --> 02:11:14,300
gotten a blow job,
had full onset jerk each other off.

3109
02:11:14,330 --> 02:11:17,990
Jesus.
I'm surprised this is news to you.

3110
02:11:18,020 --> 02:11:19,910
Well,
it's news in that way.

3111
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:20,833
Even if they did do that.
You're talking about individual sexual 

3112
02:11:23,001 --> 02:11:25,160
acts between people who are male or 
female,

3113
02:11:25,161 --> 02:11:27,170
right?
You're still talking about a man,

3114
02:11:27,430 --> 02:11:30,050
so talking about a man that's having sex
with other men.

3115
02:11:30,051 --> 02:11:32,820
You're defining it such in that way.
You're literally saying,

3116
02:11:32,870 --> 02:11:33,703
know a guy you are know you are saying.
You know guys who sucked other guys' 

3117
02:11:37,581 --> 02:11:38,900
dicks.
A guy.

3118
02:11:39,110 --> 02:11:42,110
He's done it to a guy.
You're saying a man do it to a man.

3119
02:11:42,150 --> 02:11:42,950
Gotcha.
I gotcha.

3120
02:11:42,950 --> 02:11:43,760
I gotcha.
No,

3121
02:11:43,760 --> 02:11:46,760
I'm saying that people who are 
identified as men,

3122
02:11:46,790 --> 02:11:48,530
he did.
That's what I meant.

3123
02:11:48,860 --> 02:11:53,780
People who were identified as men by 
society have done these things,

3124
02:11:53,810 --> 02:11:56,360
that society has to be unnatural for 
men,

3125
02:11:56,630 --> 02:11:59,530
but when they were doing that,
weren't they a man doing it to a man?

3126
02:11:59,540 --> 02:12:01,790
Look what happened to those guys?
Historically,

3127
02:12:02,030 --> 02:12:04,070
not so much recently,
but certainly still today,

3128
02:12:04,071 --> 02:12:07,310
but certainly historically we can't keep
going back to 100 plus years.

3129
02:12:07,310 --> 02:12:08,143
When I was talking about like right now 
I am still talking about a man who's 

3130
02:12:11,150 --> 02:12:13,160
having a sexual exchange with another 
man.

3131
02:12:13,310 --> 02:12:16,010
Like you can be sexually attracted to 
another man.

3132
02:12:16,011 --> 02:12:17,420
It doesn't mean that you're both not 
met.

3133
02:12:17,430 --> 02:12:19,470
So do you think homosexual men or men?
Sure.

3134
02:12:19,490 --> 02:12:21,080
Why?
Because they're male.

3135
02:12:21,081 --> 02:12:22,610
They have a penis,
they have x,

3136
02:12:22,611 --> 02:12:23,444
y chromosomes.
They can get a woman pregnant if they 

3137
02:12:24,861 --> 02:12:25,694
wanted to,
could donate their sperm to their 

3138
02:12:27,351 --> 02:12:28,184
lesbian pals and they just eliminated.
One of the characteristics that you 

3139
02:12:31,131 --> 02:12:33,530
previously previously said was male.
No,

3140
02:12:33,850 --> 02:12:34,490
no,
no.

3141
02:12:34,490 --> 02:12:38,630
Most men,
most are attracted to women,

3142
02:12:38,810 --> 02:12:43,700
but a good percentage of them are gay 
and this is not like complicated stuff.

3143
02:12:43,701 --> 02:12:44,570
There's still men.

3144
02:12:47,720 --> 02:12:48,670
Yeah.
I,

3145
02:12:48,780 --> 02:12:50,270
I mean,
I don't know where to go from here.

3146
02:12:50,271 --> 02:12:51,300
I mean,
I think I've,

3147
02:12:51,590 --> 02:12:53,810
I think I've made the argument I,
it's,

3148
02:12:54,020 --> 02:12:54,853
it's funny because I thought you were 
totally with me for like an hour and a 

3149
02:12:58,220 --> 02:13:01,760
half and now it's like,
I feel like you're not there.

3150
02:13:01,770 --> 02:13:02,603
I didn't know what to do.
I think there's a giant spectrum of 

3151
02:13:05,371 --> 02:13:06,204
people,
but to say that a guy is in born to a 

3152
02:13:07,351 --> 02:13:11,280
man or a woman isn't born a woman I 
think is disingenuous.

3153
02:13:12,260 --> 02:13:13,110
Yeah.
So it's,

3154
02:13:13,220 --> 02:13:14,410
it's where the.
So.

3155
02:13:15,280 --> 02:13:17,120
Okay.
Thailand,

3156
02:13:17,660 --> 02:13:20,250
Thailand.
I think in India and I think

3157
02:13:20,330 --> 02:13:24,770
there's several Polynesian countries.
There's several countries where there is

3158
02:13:24,771 --> 02:13:28,490
a legal and cultural and social category

3159
02:13:28,560 --> 02:13:31,620
that is neither man nor woman,
nor male or female.

3160
02:13:32,550 --> 02:13:34,050
Like in Thailand,
the lady boys.

3161
02:13:34,080 --> 02:13:34,913
Right.
And there's other countries to have 

3162
02:13:35,581 --> 02:13:36,241
this.
You can look it up.

3163
02:13:36,241 --> 02:13:36,930
It's either.
Sure.

3164
02:13:36,930 --> 02:13:37,480
Right.
Okay.

3165
02:13:37,480 --> 02:13:38,760
You know about this mission.
Okay.

3166
02:13:39,420 --> 02:13:40,890
Um,
what about that?

3167
02:13:41,250 --> 02:13:43,140
What about those people too?
What do you.

3168
02:13:43,190 --> 02:13:43,720
Oh,
well,

3169
02:13:43,720 --> 02:13:44,930
I think there's that too,
so.

3170
02:13:45,210 --> 02:13:46,043
Oh,

3171
02:13:46,740 --> 02:13:49,110
okay.
I'm saying people can be born a man,

3172
02:13:49,111 --> 02:13:52,560
but if people can be born a woman or you
can get these andy,

3173
02:13:52,561 --> 02:13:54,950
Dick Yoel Romero.
Weird variation.

3174
02:13:54,990 --> 02:13:55,440
But

3175
02:13:55,440 --> 02:13:56,273
Joe,
take the lady boys from Thailand and 

3176
02:13:57,961 --> 02:14:00,450
move them here to this country.
Now,

3177
02:14:01,350 --> 02:14:02,670
how will they be considered?

3178
02:14:04,680 --> 02:14:05,810
What do you mean?
How will they be?

3179
02:14:06,140 --> 02:14:08,660
Americans don't have those categories.
Okay.

3180
02:14:08,820 --> 02:14:12,480
We have only two.
A lot of variables in Thailand.

3181
02:14:12,481 --> 02:14:13,314
Also,
you're dealing with like really young 

3182
02:14:15,601 --> 02:14:18,440
sex workers.
There's a lot of weird shit that goes on

3183
02:14:18,441 --> 02:14:19,800
in Thailand.
A lot of abuse.

3184
02:14:19,801 --> 02:14:21,720
So as the ladyboy category,
real or not,

3185
02:14:22,080 --> 02:14:25,010
it certainly realizes the Trans category
there.

3186
02:14:25,020 --> 02:14:26,850
They consider that real and here we do 
not,

3187
02:14:26,880 --> 02:14:27,713
but if it is real,
and I think you agree it's Rio and I 

3188
02:14:30,361 --> 02:14:31,890
agree it's real,
right?

3189
02:14:31,930 --> 02:14:32,763
Trans people,
that means there's absolutely people 

3190
02:14:34,231 --> 02:14:35,760
that feel like they're born in the wrong
gender,

3191
02:14:37,080 --> 02:14:39,750
so why isn't a man real?
Why is it a woman?

3192
02:14:40,790 --> 02:14:42,680
If you want to say they're all equally 
real.

3193
02:14:42,681 --> 02:14:44,040
I'm down there.
We're good.

3194
02:14:44,300 --> 02:14:45,260
That's what I'm saying,
right?

3195
02:14:45,261 --> 02:14:46,130
It's just that those,
that,

3196
02:14:46,131 --> 02:14:48,830
those categories have no absolute,
you know,

3197
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:53,090
biological meaning there's not a meeting
that they're fluid,

3198
02:14:53,110 --> 02:14:53,690
they're,
you know,

3199
02:14:53,690 --> 02:14:55,190
basically arbitrary.
Sorry,

3200
02:14:55,191 --> 02:14:58,040
I mean there that we invent them.
I'm not saying it's useless,

3201
02:14:58,041 --> 02:14:59,960
I'm not saying we should never have any 
categories.

3202
02:14:59,961 --> 02:15:02,570
I'm just saying that those categories 
have changed and they changed,

3203
02:15:02,730 --> 02:15:03,563
but you kind of,
depending on where you are in the wild 

3204
02:15:05,011 --> 02:15:08,010
disagreeing with you,
you kind of did say that a man is born a

3205
02:15:08,011 --> 02:15:12,240
man and a woman isn't born and,
and for sure a lot of them are for sure.

3206
02:15:12,241 --> 02:15:13,074
A lot of people that have your 
stereotypical classic female 

3207
02:15:17,041 --> 02:15:17,874
characteristics were born female and for
sure there's a lot of men who have 

3208
02:15:21,840 --> 02:15:26,370
classic,
stereotypical male behavior and patterns

3209
02:15:26,371 --> 02:15:27,204
and desires.
They're born men and then there's trans 

3210
02:15:29,431 --> 02:15:30,264
people and then there's also,
there's asexual people to Charleston 

3211
02:15:32,460 --> 02:15:33,293
needs to be considered.
Here's people that just don't have any 

3212
02:15:34,381 --> 02:15:37,020
desire to fuck anybody.
They don't want to.

3213
02:15:37,140 --> 02:15:40,230
They don't want to be a man or a woman.
They can call themselves queer.

3214
02:15:40,231 --> 02:15:41,520
They can call themselves whatever they 
want.

3215
02:15:41,610 --> 02:15:44,880
They don't want to be a female.
They don't want to be a male,

3216
02:15:44,970 --> 02:15:46,650
they just want to be human.
Here's the deal.

3217
02:15:46,850 --> 02:15:47,683
How about let's make a deal if you,
if that's what you have to say about it 

3218
02:15:50,900 --> 02:15:51,733
and you want to not get in the way of 
people doing those things and making 

3219
02:15:54,171 --> 02:15:56,990
those decisions for themselves and let 
them do what they want to do.

3220
02:15:57,290 --> 02:15:58,530
I am totally with you.
Okay.

3221
02:15:58,630 --> 02:15:59,463
It's true for sure.
I don't want to get in the way of 

3222
02:16:00,221 --> 02:16:01,054
anybody making it.
I don't want to get in the way of 

3223
02:16:02,051 --> 02:16:03,100
furries.
That's awesome.

3224
02:16:03,130 --> 02:16:05,830
If you really identify with being a 
giant squirrel,

3225
02:16:05,960 --> 02:16:07,040
that's awesome.
That's great.

3226
02:16:07,070 --> 02:16:09,140
And that's really what matters.
Um,

3227
02:16:09,230 --> 02:16:13,550
I'm just saying that claims and I want 
to end it here,

3228
02:16:14,420 --> 02:16:15,253
claims about these essential 
characteristics that it's biologically 

3229
02:16:18,441 --> 02:16:19,274
determined,
right?

3230
02:16:19,850 --> 02:16:23,690
You know,
are the things that reinforce getting in

3231
02:16:23,691 --> 02:16:25,040
the way.
Laws,

3232
02:16:25,070 --> 02:16:26,090
policies,
cultures,

3233
02:16:26,091 --> 02:16:26,924
ideas,
norms that get in the way of people 

3234
02:16:28,341 --> 02:16:30,370
doing what they want to do with their 
own lives.

3235
02:16:30,700 --> 02:16:32,410
MM,
right.

3236
02:16:32,690 --> 02:16:35,970
Because yeah,
for sure with some people will be.

3237
02:16:36,090 --> 02:16:39,740
Variables are so extreme and the 
spectrum is so broad.

3238
02:16:39,850 --> 02:16:41,590
So after I was on your show the first 
time,

3239
02:16:42,350 --> 02:16:43,183
a got a whole bunch of comments from 
people calling me a fag and a pussy and 

3240
02:16:46,601 --> 02:16:49,720
a sissy and a this and that.
Read those feminizing me.

3241
02:16:49,721 --> 02:16:51,190
And it's not your fault for calling me a
girl.

3242
02:16:51,340 --> 02:16:52,550
You can't read those.
I know,

3243
02:16:52,560 --> 02:16:53,320
I know.
It's whatever.

3244
02:16:53,320 --> 02:16:54,153
I don't know.
I mean people like came to twitter and 

3245
02:16:55,061 --> 02:16:55,601
whatever.
Yeah.

3246
02:16:55,601 --> 02:16:56,610
You don't read those?
No,

3247
02:16:56,620 --> 02:16:57,490
I stopped.
I learned.

3248
02:16:57,690 --> 02:16:58,350
Oh yeah.
Stopped.

3249
02:16:58,350 --> 02:16:59,350
I don't do anymore.
I didn't matter.

3250
02:16:59,351 --> 02:17:01,270
I didn't care.
This didn't bother me at all.

3251
02:17:01,450 --> 02:17:03,640
I just thought it was interesting.
I actually agreed so in other words,

3252
02:17:03,641 --> 02:17:04,474
and a lot of them they were really 
saying and some of them elaborated on 

3253
02:17:07,121 --> 02:17:10,990
this was that I was not really man 
enough.

3254
02:17:11,770 --> 02:17:13,600
Right.
I was less of a man for whatever reason.

3255
02:17:13,601 --> 02:17:14,770
I don't know.
I don't care.

3256
02:17:14,800 --> 02:17:15,650
It's fine.
I liked it.

3257
02:17:15,651 --> 02:17:16,484
It was funny,
but it really proves my point is that 

3258
02:17:19,270 --> 02:17:20,103
these things are very fluid.
So they kind of were kicking me out of 

3259
02:17:22,211 --> 02:17:23,770
the category of Man and I was like,
cool,

3260
02:17:24,340 --> 02:17:24,840
please.

3261
02:17:24,840 --> 02:17:25,673
I think they were trying to get a ride,
so I now I don't think you could make a 

3262
02:17:28,831 --> 02:17:30,630
rational argument dealing with Internet.

3263
02:17:31,320 --> 02:17:32,100
No,
of course not.

3264
02:17:32,100 --> 02:17:34,440
I'm saying it's just one example of what
goes on generally,

3265
02:17:34,441 --> 02:17:35,940
which is that we do this all the time,
right?

3266
02:17:36,030 --> 02:17:37,320
Yeah,
but they're not even human.

3267
02:17:37,321 --> 02:17:39,330
Like when someone's interacting with you
like that,

3268
02:17:39,500 --> 02:17:42,690
it's lacking all of the characteristics 
of human interaction.

3269
02:17:42,810 --> 02:17:44,820
You're not there with a person.
You're not looking at them.

3270
02:17:44,970 --> 02:17:46,650
If someone was in front of you like 
that,

3271
02:17:46,651 --> 02:17:47,640
oh,
you're a fag.

3272
02:17:47,760 --> 02:17:48,660
You,
you'd be like,

3273
02:17:48,690 --> 02:17:49,650
Oh my God,
I'm in danger.

3274
02:17:49,651 --> 02:17:50,484
There's a crazy person might have to 
defend myself against this person 

3275
02:17:53,040 --> 02:17:54,600
because if someone is treating me that 
way,

3276
02:17:54,601 --> 02:17:56,490
insulting me,
looking me in the eye.

3277
02:17:56,740 --> 02:17:59,730
We're so close to violence like anything
can happen here.

3278
02:17:59,940 --> 02:18:01,560
I guess as a person.
That's not rational.

3279
02:18:01,590 --> 02:18:02,423
It is amazing,
isn't it?

3280
02:18:03,010 --> 02:18:04,990
Talking to my son as we were driving 
over here,

3281
02:18:04,991 --> 02:18:06,270
because you know he,
he reads,

3282
02:18:06,280 --> 02:18:07,113
he,
he read all the comments when I was on 

3283
02:18:08,801 --> 02:18:10,600
your shows and he was like,
it was so fun.

3284
02:18:10,601 --> 02:18:11,051
Is like,
toby,

3285
02:18:11,051 --> 02:18:12,890
don't read that shit man.
It's just,

3286
02:18:13,460 --> 02:18:15,750
it's funny.
Uh,

3287
02:18:16,210 --> 02:18:17,043
but uh,
it is remarkable how many people do 

3288
02:18:18,701 --> 02:18:19,190
that.
Right?

3289
02:18:19,190 --> 02:18:21,370
And it's not just that they have these 
thoughts about you,

3290
02:18:21,371 --> 02:18:22,204
it's that they go out of their way to 
write it in public to do something that 

3291
02:18:26,110 --> 02:18:26,943
they'll actually sit down.
That's what boggles my mind is that 

3292
02:18:29,171 --> 02:18:30,004
someone will actually take the time and 
energy to like sit there and write this 

3293
02:18:32,951 --> 02:18:35,140
thing on youtube or whatever you know 
about,

3294
02:18:35,170 --> 02:18:36,970
you know,
this or that about me.

3295
02:18:37,180 --> 02:18:38,440
It's phenomenal.

3296
02:18:38,710 --> 02:18:40,820
Sometimes people have good points.
No.

3297
02:18:41,440 --> 02:18:43,540
Sometimes they're not.
Even when they're insulting you,

3298
02:18:43,541 --> 02:18:46,030
sometimes they're making points while 
they're insulting you.

3299
02:18:46,270 --> 02:18:48,970
It's just hard to separate the wheat 
from the chaff.

3300
02:18:49,360 --> 02:18:50,380
Yeah.
It's,

3301
02:18:50,870 --> 02:18:53,950
it's a weird way of interacting with 
people that didn't exist.

3302
02:18:54,010 --> 02:18:56,290
I mean,
there was never a time in our past where

3303
02:18:56,291 --> 02:18:57,124
you could with real time during real 
instantaneously send something to 

3304
02:19:00,761 --> 02:19:01,594
someone and then they read it right away
and they could be rude and all they are 

3305
02:19:04,601 --> 02:19:08,880
is a twitter egg with a bunch of numbers
and letters and they call you a homo and

3306
02:19:08,881 --> 02:19:09,714
it's the real downside of the Internet,
which otherwise is a miraculous boon to 

3307
02:19:13,001 --> 02:19:15,460
humanity.
I feel like it's an adolescent stage.

3308
02:19:15,550 --> 02:19:20,550
I feel like we are finding our way 
through this inescapable new technology,

3309
02:19:21,260 --> 02:19:23,350
this,
this connection that we're sharing,

3310
02:19:23,620 --> 02:19:24,760
which is just.
Well,

3311
02:19:24,761 --> 02:19:28,010
it's one of the reasons why I think it's
to have

3312
02:19:28,070 --> 02:19:31,010
one on one conversations with people and
one of the things that I've noticed from

3313
02:19:31,011 --> 02:19:31,844
doing this podcast is how how many 
interesting people there are there out 

3314
02:19:36,620 --> 02:19:38,660
there in the world like yourself that I 
could talk to,

3315
02:19:38,661 --> 02:19:43,010
but also how bad most people are in the 
world.

3316
02:19:43,220 --> 02:19:47,960
We're just talking to each other.
We don't ever have long conversations.

3317
02:19:47,961 --> 02:19:49,520
Everybody's checking their fucking 
phone.

3318
02:19:49,560 --> 02:19:50,393
Everybody's watching a television.
It's worry about that because I'm very 

3319
02:19:53,661 --> 02:19:55,970
pro technology and all this stuff,
but that does worry me.

3320
02:19:56,030 --> 02:19:56,863
I want to go into a restaurant and I see
people sitting at the same table all 

3321
02:19:58,941 --> 02:19:59,960
looking at their phones.
Oh yeah.

3322
02:19:59,961 --> 02:20:00,794
Like 70 precedent.
It's still like a group of seven that's 

3323
02:20:02,600 --> 02:20:03,433
pressing and I and I have wondered about
the quality of conversation generally 

3324
02:20:06,360 --> 02:20:07,880
because just what you're saying.
Yeah.

3325
02:20:07,881 --> 02:20:11,780
I've been wondering and thinking it 
might actually be declining.

3326
02:20:11,840 --> 02:20:14,020
The quality of our conversations.
Personally.

3327
02:20:14,030 --> 02:20:14,863
I definitely think it is.
I find myself continually disappointed 

3328
02:20:19,970 --> 02:20:23,420
with very smart people that I meet that 
don't have real conversation.

3329
02:20:23,421 --> 02:20:25,440
They talk over people.
They don't.

3330
02:20:25,520 --> 02:20:26,353
They're not listening.
They're not responding to what you're 

3331
02:20:29,151 --> 02:20:29,984
saying.
They're waiting for you to stop talking 

3332
02:20:30,741 --> 02:20:35,360
so they can talk and it's like,
it's like this self centered sort of way

3333
02:20:35,361 --> 02:20:39,260
of interacting with each other.
That seems more prevalent than not.

3334
02:20:40,010 --> 02:20:40,843
I'm used to that because I'm around 
academics a lot because they're used to 

3335
02:20:43,371 --> 02:20:44,204
lecturing and that they're the smartest 
person in the room and so all their job 

3336
02:20:46,161 --> 02:20:48,110
is to do is to tell us what's true.
Right?

3337
02:20:48,111 --> 02:20:49,790
So they're,
they're very comfortable with that.

3338
02:20:49,791 --> 02:20:50,624
I was always amazed when I'd watch these
are really important famous professors 

3339
02:20:54,051 --> 02:20:54,920
at Columbia,
you know,

3340
02:20:54,921 --> 02:20:56,870
give these lectures to the hall of 500 
people in.

3341
02:20:56,870 --> 02:20:57,703
It seemed to me they didn't even know 
that there are other people in the room 

3342
02:21:00,530 --> 02:21:03,290
the way they were talking.
Like it didn't matter what the reactions

3343
02:21:03,291 --> 02:21:04,490
were,
whether people were asleep,

3344
02:21:04,491 --> 02:21:06,270
whether they're reading the newspaper,
they just didn't care.

3345
02:21:06,271 --> 02:21:08,300
They just kept going.
He kept talking to talk and talk for two

3346
02:21:08,301 --> 02:21:10,200
hours straight ahead.
You know,

3347
02:21:10,210 --> 02:21:11,150
I just,
I can't do that.

3348
02:21:11,151 --> 02:21:11,984
I'm the exact opposite.
I panic if I feel like the person I'm 

3349
02:21:14,571 --> 02:21:16,430
talking to isn't listening to me.
That's good.

3350
02:21:16,431 --> 02:21:17,500
I panic.
Yeah.

3351
02:21:17,780 --> 02:21:20,660
And so when I see if I'm lecturing to 
200 students,

3352
02:21:20,870 --> 02:21:24,050
I see one kid kind of just get a little 
distracted.

3353
02:21:24,051 --> 02:21:24,884
I freak and I feel like I have to up my 
game right then and I have to go 

3354
02:21:27,111 --> 02:21:29,060
directly address them.
That means you care.

3355
02:21:29,240 --> 02:21:29,871
Yeah.
I mean,

3356
02:21:29,871 --> 02:21:31,640
whatever it is,
I care in a particular way.

3357
02:21:31,640 --> 02:21:32,660
I mean,
it's some,

3358
02:21:32,840 --> 02:21:34,730
it's another form of narcissism I 
suppose,

3359
02:21:34,731 --> 02:21:35,564
but I really,
I do think that's what makes me a good 

3360
02:21:36,951 --> 02:21:40,220
teacher because I,
I have to have interaction will you want

3361
02:21:40,221 --> 02:21:42,770
to connect,
they need to know what you're hearing,

3362
02:21:43,230 --> 02:21:44,063
right?
I need to know what you're hearing from 

3363
02:21:44,811 --> 02:21:46,550
me.
That's the thing,

3364
02:21:46,551 --> 02:21:49,370
and then we can really talk and then I 
also am really curious.

3365
02:21:49,371 --> 02:21:50,204
I'm just a curious person and I want to 
know what you're thinking and let's do 

3366
02:21:53,451 --> 02:21:54,001
this,
you know,

3367
02:21:54,001 --> 02:21:54,834
let's.
And then let's have that chemistry that 

3368
02:21:55,761 --> 02:21:57,080
happened just now,
which got hot,

3369
02:21:57,110 --> 02:21:58,970
you know,
but like that's,

3370
02:21:59,180 --> 02:22:02,270
that's where life is.
That's where real personal relationships

3371
02:22:02,271 --> 02:22:03,104
are.
Yeah.

3372
02:22:03,170 --> 02:22:04,003
Comics kind of do the same thing too 
because they're used to being the one 

3373
02:22:05,901 --> 02:22:08,660
who's talking on stage or if they do a 
podcast,

3374
02:22:08,690 --> 02:22:11,140
they're used to being the one who's 
talking all the time.

3375
02:22:11,330 --> 02:22:12,980
The ones who do crowd work.
Right.

3376
02:22:13,220 --> 02:22:14,630
Amazing.
If you think about it,

3377
02:22:14,670 --> 02:22:15,503
if they're the ones who interact,
have a whole part of their act where 

3378
02:22:17,181 --> 02:22:19,130
it's crowd work.
Most comics,

3379
02:22:19,131 --> 02:22:21,170
I mean don't they have some indirect?
Yeah,

3380
02:22:21,171 --> 02:22:23,150
definitely the interaction with the 
crowd and happens a lot.

3381
02:22:23,151 --> 02:22:25,920
I mean you're dealing with people 
drinking alcohol

3382
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:26,903
in a social environment and it's dark 
out and it's nighttime and they're 

3383
02:22:29,361 --> 02:22:30,194
having fun and they're laughing and and 
especially when you're talking about 

3384
02:22:32,341 --> 02:22:35,730
controversial opinions in subjects,
people always,

3385
02:22:36,900 --> 02:22:38,100
all the comics talk about,
you know,

3386
02:22:38,101 --> 02:22:41,330
you feel the room,
you feel that interaction.

3387
02:22:41,370 --> 02:22:42,203
I'm saying I'm talking about these 
professors and they're tweed jackets at 

3388
02:22:44,551 --> 02:22:45,384
Columbia.
I swear to God it didn't matter what 

3389
02:22:46,561 --> 02:22:48,920
happened,
what was happening and the lecturer is a

3390
02:22:48,960 --> 02:22:53,420
certain amount of arrogance and I'm sure
you must get after being a professor,

3391
02:22:53,820 --> 02:22:56,820
it's a particular narcissism.
They live entirely in their heads,

3392
02:22:56,821 --> 02:22:57,654
right?
They just sit in their study and read 

3393
02:22:58,411 --> 02:22:59,244
books and then they go out and then give
a lecture and then they come back and 

3394
02:23:01,321 --> 02:23:02,880
read this,
read the book and you know,

3395
02:23:03,420 --> 02:23:04,253
it's a weird narcissism.
I can't really get to interact with 

3396
02:23:05,881 --> 02:23:07,920
other professors and go over there,
work together.

3397
02:23:07,920 --> 02:23:09,810
You know,
I am stereotyping and generalizing.

3398
02:23:09,811 --> 02:23:12,720
This is not everybody,
but I did see this a lot and I still do.

3399
02:23:12,990 --> 02:23:14,130
Yeah,
there's some interactions,

3400
02:23:14,131 --> 02:23:15,150
but again,
it's mostly through,

3401
02:23:15,151 --> 02:23:15,984
you know,
you write a paper and then you send it 

3402
02:23:16,921 --> 02:23:17,754
out to the journal and then some other 
professor reviews it write anonymously 

3403
02:23:21,121 --> 02:23:21,954
often and sends it back.
It's all very weird passive aggressive 

3404
02:23:24,211 --> 02:23:25,044
shit too.
Like that's the other thing about 

3405
02:23:26,101 --> 02:23:30,660
academia I can't stand is that they are 
allergic to direct conflict.

3406
02:23:31,260 --> 02:23:32,093
Like the argument you and I just had,
that's pretty much not allowed except 

3407
02:23:36,001 --> 02:23:38,280
through writing.
They'll do it through writing,

3408
02:23:38,890 --> 02:23:39,723
but they won't do it head to head.
That's a real problem because it takes 

3409
02:23:42,631 --> 02:23:44,490
too long to work out an idea that way.
Yeah.

3410
02:23:44,520 --> 02:23:45,353
Like real debate.
When I went to college I had this idea 

3411
02:23:49,320 --> 02:23:53,220
that it would be really smart people,
like professors,

3412
02:23:53,280 --> 02:23:56,190
like more than one would be in a room 
and they would have,

3413
02:23:56,220 --> 02:23:58,950
you know,
one major issue and they would debate it

3414
02:23:59,520 --> 02:24:01,290
that there would be argument,
right.

3415
02:24:01,590 --> 02:24:03,990
There'll be conflict of ideas about an 
idea.

3416
02:24:04,710 --> 02:24:06,750
No,
it's not that.

3417
02:24:06,960 --> 02:24:11,960
It's never that I have been in and 
around college campuses for 32 years.

3418
02:24:14,490 --> 02:24:18,120
I have never really seen a head to head 
debate.

3419
02:24:18,150 --> 02:24:20,580
Like even I just had,
that's insane.

3420
02:24:20,610 --> 02:24:23,850
Person to person,
I mean here and there a little bit,

3421
02:24:23,851 --> 02:24:25,830
but not like that.
Not what we're really,

3422
02:24:25,831 --> 02:24:28,590
really going at it.
I don't think I've ever seen that.

3423
02:24:28,740 --> 02:24:31,020
I mean the enemy among faculty.
Some students do,

3424
02:24:31,320 --> 02:24:33,450
but faculty don't.
They're scared of it.

3425
02:24:33,540 --> 02:24:36,810
I'm telling you,
there's a problem with cowardice and one

3426
02:24:36,811 --> 02:24:39,180
of the real tragedies with that is that 
as I said,

3427
02:24:39,181 --> 02:24:43,590
there's no real conflict of ideas which 
is reinforced by the tenure system,

3428
02:24:43,680 --> 02:24:46,350
the accreditation system.
It's a,

3429
02:24:46,351 --> 02:24:50,910
it's this monolith where there's one,
and this is why you get this uniformity,

3430
02:24:50,920 --> 02:24:55,920
the uniformity of the ideas on campuses.
It's all this monolith that actually has

3431
02:24:56,311 --> 02:24:57,810
its head at the federal government.

3432
02:24:58,950 --> 02:25:00,390
Do you know about the accreditation 
system?

3433
02:25:02,030 --> 02:25:03,570
Would it be?
If it's the mafia,

3434
02:25:03,840 --> 02:25:04,673
people don't even know this.
To get accredited as a college or 

3435
02:25:07,501 --> 02:25:08,334
university in this country,
you have to be accredited by an agency 

3436
02:25:11,190 --> 02:25:12,023
that is,
that is authorized by the Department of 

3437
02:25:14,970 --> 02:25:15,803
Education in Washington DC.
The secretary of Education has to 

3438
02:25:19,770 --> 02:25:24,770
authorize your existence as a legitimate
legal college or university.

3439
02:25:26,500 --> 02:25:27,333
That's it.
So renegade university people were 

3440
02:25:29,231 --> 02:25:30,910
asking me,
they wanted me,

3441
02:25:30,940 --> 02:25:32,800
they want some people want to call it 
credit and I was like,

3442
02:25:32,830 --> 02:25:33,760
Oh,
let me look into this.

3443
02:25:34,690 --> 02:25:35,523
And so I did and I quickly found out 
that it's the fucking mafia that I 

3444
02:25:38,621 --> 02:25:41,980
couldn't get accredited because they 
have all these,

3445
02:25:42,900 --> 02:25:43,733
they have all these standards.
You have to have a particular number of 

3446
02:25:46,481 --> 02:25:48,430
buildings,
a particular number of professors.

3447
02:25:48,431 --> 02:25:51,040
You have to have a library with a 
particular number of books in it.

3448
02:25:51,670 --> 02:25:54,250
You have to have a gym,
you have to drop all these things and if

3449
02:25:54,251 --> 02:25:56,710
you don't have those things you're not 
in,

3450
02:25:57,790 --> 02:25:59,530
you don't get that.
You don't get college credit,

3451
02:25:59,560 --> 02:26:00,393
no other.
So what if you did like I gave you five 

3452
02:26:02,381 --> 02:26:03,214
credits for taking one of my courses?
No other college and university would 

3453
02:26:06,401 --> 02:26:10,030
recognize it if you want it to transfer,
like you wanted to go to graduate school

3454
02:26:10,031 --> 02:26:10,960
or go somewhere else,
do something.

3455
02:26:11,620 --> 02:26:12,453
No,
employers would look at it and see that 

3456
02:26:14,021 --> 02:26:17,110
it's not an accredited university where 
you've got those credits from.

3457
02:26:17,290 --> 02:26:19,900
So how do those degree mills,
how do they do it?

3458
02:26:20,050 --> 02:26:20,883
Right.
So there's two different systems at the 

3459
02:26:23,140 --> 02:26:23,973
Department of Education controls.
One is for the so called elite 

3460
02:26:25,721 --> 02:26:26,554
prestigious schools.
Those are regional accreditation 

3461
02:26:28,841 --> 02:26:30,010
agencies.
Again,

3462
02:26:30,070 --> 02:26:35,070
all authorized by the Department of 
Education and the for profit colleges.

3463
02:26:35,800 --> 02:26:40,060
There's a separate accreditation system 
called the national accreditation system

3464
02:26:40,061 --> 02:26:41,860
and that's also controlled by the 
department of education,

3465
02:26:41,861 --> 02:26:44,460
but everybody knows within it that if 
you get,

3466
02:26:44,570 --> 02:26:47,290
if you get accredited by one of the 
national accreditation system,

3467
02:26:47,291 --> 02:26:50,110
zero bullshit for profit the Greenville.

3468
02:26:50,140 --> 02:26:50,973
So those credits,
you can't transfer them to Harvard or 

3469
02:26:54,461 --> 02:26:58,090
occidental or any of the of the elite so
called elite schools.

3470
02:26:58,450 --> 02:26:59,283
So they're completely kept separate.
But you can't even if you get a degree 

3471
02:27:02,291 --> 02:27:04,550
from like Phoenix University,
you know that you can't.

3472
02:27:04,551 --> 02:27:07,210
You can get 5,000 degrees from Phoenix 
University.

3473
02:27:07,660 --> 02:27:08,493
My degree is,
I can't take anywhere and I'm talking 

3474
02:27:09,581 --> 02:27:14,230
about even even community colleges won't
accept those credits.

3475
02:27:16,150 --> 02:27:17,860
Yeah,
that's interesting.

3476
02:27:17,890 --> 02:27:19,780
It's the mafia.
So think about that,

3477
02:27:19,781 --> 02:27:21,580
right?
The Department of Education,

3478
02:27:21,610 --> 02:27:24,910
one person,
federal government decides who's in,

3479
02:27:24,940 --> 02:27:25,773
who's out,
and then inside that system there's 

3480
02:27:29,140 --> 02:27:31,300
tenure,
lifetime appointment.

3481
02:27:32,110 --> 02:27:35,080
Those people control the curriculum,
what is taught.

3482
02:27:35,170 --> 02:27:36,003
They also control who's hired and fired 
faculty control all the hiring and 

3483
02:27:39,101 --> 02:27:43,000
firing of faculty and tenure.
They ultimately control that basically.

3484
02:27:43,600 --> 02:27:44,433
Right.
And they're there forever like dawns in 

3485
02:27:47,561 --> 02:27:48,910
the Mafia.
Seriously.

3486
02:27:49,570 --> 02:27:54,280
So you wonder why when you walk into any
college classroom in this country,

3487
02:27:54,340 --> 02:27:55,173
you hear basically the same shit being 
said and sociology classes and history 

3488
02:27:57,851 --> 02:28:02,830
classes.
That's why it's astonishing.

3489
02:28:02,831 --> 02:28:03,664
And I didn't even know the full extent 
of it until I started renegade 

3490
02:28:06,041 --> 02:28:08,080
university and people started asking me 
about this.

3491
02:28:08,170 --> 02:28:11,170
What if you were,
if someone allowed you to come along,

3492
02:28:11,180 --> 02:28:12,500
if Donald Trump said that,
he says,

3493
02:28:12,520 --> 02:28:14,360
I love your work.
Uh,

3494
02:28:14,370 --> 02:28:16,330
what,
what could you do to fix that?

3495
02:28:16,331 --> 02:28:20,260
What would you offer as an alternative?
We have to change it.

3496
02:28:20,320 --> 02:28:21,410
No,
there's nothing I do.

3497
02:28:21,650 --> 02:28:22,460
I mean meaning,

3498
02:28:22,460 --> 02:28:24,350
if he wanted credit,
like college credit,

3499
02:28:25,040 --> 02:28:26,510
right now there's really nothing I can 
do.

3500
02:28:26,810 --> 02:28:27,643
I can certainly give them a certificate 
and maybe an employer will think it's 

3501
02:28:30,561 --> 02:28:31,394
meaningful because my name's on it.
Is it less and less valuable to have a 

3502
02:28:34,401 --> 02:28:35,234
degree today?
I'm saying I'm just completely outside 

3503
02:28:37,191 --> 02:28:37,700
the system.
Right,

3504
02:28:37,700 --> 02:28:38,630
I understand.
Yeah.

3505
02:28:38,631 --> 02:28:39,470
But like,
if you,

3506
02:28:39,560 --> 02:28:40,393
if you admired me and my work right,
and you saw and I had and he had a 

3507
02:28:44,451 --> 02:28:48,890
certificate saying this guy's great and 
he took my course,

3508
02:28:49,070 --> 02:28:50,690
you as an employer,
it would actually help.

3509
02:28:50,720 --> 02:28:51,553
Sure.
And then in that case it would be 

3510
02:28:52,101 --> 02:28:53,450
meaningful.
My credits,

3511
02:28:53,451 --> 02:28:55,640
I'm just saying that's completely 
outside.

3512
02:28:55,641 --> 02:28:56,474
It means nothing inside the system of 
the thousands and thousands of colleges 

3513
02:28:59,331 --> 02:29:01,490
and universities.
And for most employers,

3514
02:29:01,570 --> 02:29:04,550
right?
Most employers abide by this.

3515
02:29:04,640 --> 02:29:06,290
They think that if you're not 
accredited,

3516
02:29:06,530 --> 02:29:07,363
your bullshit.

3517
02:29:08,210 --> 02:29:09,043
So we have to change it.
And Betsy devoss for whatever her 

3518
02:29:13,821 --> 02:29:14,654
problems are,
seems to be the first secretary of 

3519
02:29:17,571 --> 02:29:22,571
education maybe we've ever had who could
be willing to challenge this.

3520
02:29:23,150 --> 02:29:23,901
Really?
Yeah.

3521
02:29:23,901 --> 02:29:24,734
Because she's about deregulation and 
privatization and all this stuff and 

3522
02:29:28,161 --> 02:29:29,740
choice school choice.
Um,

3523
02:29:29,840 --> 02:29:30,673
and we need a movement right now before 
she's gone to get her to abolish the 

3524
02:29:35,331 --> 02:29:39,230
national accreditation system all with a
stroke of a pen,

3525
02:29:39,710 --> 02:29:40,543
I think.
And maybe a congressional act probably 

3526
02:29:41,710 --> 02:29:45,650
takes a congressional act to.
But she herself I think could discredit.

3527
02:29:45,680 --> 02:29:46,513
Yeah,
I'm pretty sure she could discredit all 

3528
02:29:47,451 --> 02:29:48,284
those agencies right now.
So you think there's just this inherent 

3529
02:29:50,841 --> 02:29:51,674
bottleneck that it's existed for so long
and that these people have been in 

3530
02:29:54,921 --> 02:29:57,710
charge of saying what is true and what's
not true?

3531
02:29:57,711 --> 02:29:58,544
What should it be taught in monopoly,
a monopoly ultimately controlled by the 

3532
02:30:01,071 --> 02:30:05,090
federal government that it's also not 
universally agreed that they're correct.

3533
02:30:05,840 --> 02:30:06,990
Correct.
Correct.

3534
02:30:07,010 --> 02:30:10,030
In what they're teaching and it's not 
like there's a,

3535
02:30:10,031 --> 02:30:14,470
an absolute standard for what needs to 
be taught if someone wants to get into.

3536
02:30:14,500 --> 02:30:14,781
No,
no,

3537
02:30:14,781 --> 02:30:16,910
there are up.
I mean there are absolute standards.

3538
02:30:16,911 --> 02:30:18,710
This is what I'm saying,
like you have to have this,

3539
02:30:18,711 --> 02:30:19,544
that,
and the other thing on your college 

3540
02:30:20,061 --> 02:30:21,070
campus to be accredited.
No,

3541
02:30:21,140 --> 02:30:22,050
that's what I mean.
I mean,

3542
02:30:22,430 --> 02:30:24,380
in terms of like what is,
uh,

3543
02:30:24,410 --> 02:30:25,243
what,
what constitutes a master's degree in 

3544
02:30:26,421 --> 02:30:27,410
literature,
right.

3545
02:30:27,650 --> 02:30:29,840
Like,
is there an absolute standard?

3546
02:30:30,860 --> 02:30:31,580
Yeah,
for the.

3547
02:30:31,580 --> 02:30:32,060
Yes.
The,

3548
02:30:32,060 --> 02:30:33,320
well,
they're pretty absolute.

3549
02:30:33,321 --> 02:30:34,154
I mean,
accreditation agencies mostly agree on 

3550
02:30:35,151 --> 02:30:35,984
those things.
So why couldn't you just reproduce that 

3551
02:30:38,300 --> 02:30:39,133
in an environment where you're being 
taught by someone who obviously has a 

3552
02:30:42,891 --> 02:30:45,070
mastery of that particular subject?
That's what Joe.

3553
02:30:45,360 --> 02:30:46,390
That's what I'm doing.
Yeah,

3554
02:30:46,550 --> 02:30:47,301
that's what we're doing.
Well,

3555
02:30:47,301 --> 02:30:48,540
that's what's happened.
It's not just me,

3556
02:30:48,620 --> 02:30:49,050
right?

3557
02:30:49,050 --> 02:30:49,840
I'm,
I'm,

3558
02:30:49,840 --> 02:30:51,260
you know,
one of the pioneers.

3559
02:30:51,261 --> 02:30:52,820
But it's happening.
How many other people are doing what?

3560
02:30:52,821 --> 02:30:54,290
You're doing a handful.
I mean,

3561
02:30:54,340 --> 02:30:57,280
but it's becoming a new Jordan Peterson 
is actually looking at.

3562
02:30:57,950 --> 02:30:59,300
When I heard him talking about that on 
your show,

3563
02:30:59,301 --> 02:30:59,991
I said,
go for it,

3564
02:30:59,991 --> 02:31:00,441
man.
Yeah.

3565
02:31:00,441 --> 02:31:02,030
Well he didn't grant.
We know what he said.

3566
02:31:02,031 --> 02:31:02,864
He was no criticism at all.
I didn't know this either until 

3567
02:31:05,481 --> 02:31:06,260
recently.
He,

3568
02:31:06,260 --> 02:31:08,840
he had this idea.
What was it about accreditation?

3569
02:31:08,841 --> 02:31:10,820
He thought it was possible somehow to 
get accredited,

3570
02:31:10,821 --> 02:31:11,900
but it's not.
You can't.

3571
02:31:11,901 --> 02:31:14,210
We have to start an entirely separate 
parallel,

3572
02:31:14,211 --> 02:31:16,220
different system Canada.
Uh,

3573
02:31:16,250 --> 02:31:19,800
possibly it could be.
That could be credited and possible.

3574
02:31:19,950 --> 02:31:21,030
But anyway,
regardless,

3575
02:31:21,031 --> 02:31:24,060
I am all for him doing that.
I hope he does.

3576
02:31:24,120 --> 02:31:25,740
I will tell you,
it was recently denied.

3577
02:31:25,741 --> 02:31:27,980
A grant for the first time is Debit 
Korea.

3578
02:31:27,990 --> 02:31:29,940
I'm sure they're not playing around.

3579
02:31:30,070 --> 02:31:33,420
They're not playing around on this is 
their castle.

3580
02:31:33,570 --> 02:31:35,340
They're not going to let us.
The Naves in.

3581
02:31:35,610 --> 02:31:36,443
Well,
what's interesting is because of social 

3582
02:31:37,501 --> 02:31:38,334
media,
because of coming on podcasts like mine 

3583
02:31:39,901 --> 02:31:40,734
and his youtube presence,
he's actually got a large movement of 

3584
02:31:43,831 --> 02:31:48,420
people that are interested in his ideas.
He had a disastrous fucking conversation

3585
02:31:48,421 --> 02:31:49,800
with Sam Harris.
I don't know if I heard it.

3586
02:31:49,860 --> 02:31:51,900
I did.
What in the fuck was that all about?

3587
02:31:51,901 --> 02:31:53,070
Well,
he's holding onto God.

3588
02:31:53,190 --> 02:31:55,490
Well,
the first one wasn't even that.

3589
02:31:55,500 --> 02:31:57,660
It was about truth.
That was God though.

3590
02:31:57,860 --> 02:31:58,693
It was.
Yeah,

3591
02:31:58,770 --> 02:32:02,780
because Jordan had religious and he 
believes he's religious,

3592
02:32:02,790 --> 02:32:03,623
so he wants to hold onto this idea about
what is truth being valuable for 

3593
02:32:09,271 --> 02:32:12,360
humankind versus what is truth.
Like one plus one equals two.

3594
02:32:12,750 --> 02:32:13,583
Right.
Moral moral truth versus I was kind of 

3595
02:32:16,201 --> 02:32:20,130
on either side and that one was so 
verbose but was too many words.

3596
02:32:20,270 --> 02:32:23,190
It was like,
you guys gotTa fucking edit this down.

3597
02:32:23,191 --> 02:32:24,024
It was tough with Jordan had to boil it 
down and they did a way better podcast 

3598
02:32:27,151 --> 02:32:29,110
the second time.
Did you hear the second one?

3599
02:32:29,370 --> 02:32:30,950
Much,
much better.

3600
02:32:31,050 --> 02:32:32,820
Much more concise.
Much clear,

3601
02:32:32,970 --> 02:32:33,960
but that again,
this,

3602
02:32:34,230 --> 02:32:37,770
I think there was this certain amount of
healed digging on both sides.

3603
02:32:37,771 --> 02:32:39,720
They dug their heels in,
they stood their ground.

3604
02:32:39,721 --> 02:32:42,450
This one really preposterous issue,
which just like,

3605
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:43,833
you know,
you're listening to this like Jesus 

3606
02:32:44,581 --> 02:32:45,690
fucking Christ.
Guys,

3607
02:32:45,691 --> 02:32:48,000
you just talking about truth for an hour
and a half.

3608
02:32:48,001 --> 02:32:48,840
Like,
what is truth?

3609
02:32:48,990 --> 02:32:51,450
Here's what's true.
Fire Burns paper.

3610
02:32:51,451 --> 02:32:53,280
That's fucking true.
Okay.

3611
02:32:53,340 --> 02:32:55,530
Like take a piece of paper.
Write it on fire.

3612
02:32:55,560 --> 02:32:56,850
So stop.
Goddammit.

3613
02:32:57,630 --> 02:32:58,463
You're going to make me go again.
I don't want to have this conversation 

3614
02:32:59,550 --> 02:33:01,020
now.
It's really important,

3615
02:33:01,021 --> 02:33:03,660
but let's leave it there as well.
So I did agree with them,

3616
02:33:03,690 --> 02:33:04,350
Sam and Jordan.

3617
02:33:04,350 --> 02:33:06,930
That is really important.
I just disagree with them about what,

3618
02:33:07,050 --> 02:33:08,010
what's going on.
But anyway,

3619
02:33:08,510 --> 02:33:10,560
um,
the definition of the word true,

3620
02:33:10,561 --> 02:33:13,380
but you know what should be,
they should have had more leeway on both

3621
02:33:13,381 --> 02:33:14,880
sides with that.
Yeah.

3622
02:33:15,210 --> 02:33:16,710
Anyway,
so either way,

3623
02:33:16,711 --> 02:33:17,670
here's the thing,
he said,

3624
02:33:17,680 --> 02:33:19,320
fascinating guy.
Totally.

3625
02:33:19,470 --> 02:33:21,990
I have major disagreements with Sam 
Jordan,

3626
02:33:22,650 --> 02:33:27,480
but there's still heroic and I'm totally
with them because they are doing this.

3627
02:33:27,481 --> 02:33:28,314
I mean Sam's not doing it formally,
but he's essentially part of this 

3628
02:33:30,001 --> 02:33:31,740
movement.
You're a part of this movement.

3629
02:33:32,340 --> 02:33:34,230
You know what the Donald,
you know what the election was about.

3630
02:33:34,680 --> 02:33:38,400
It was about a civil war in this country
that's been going on for a long time.

3631
02:33:38,401 --> 02:33:39,234
That finally came to a head in November,
which is a war between the people who 

3632
02:33:43,171 --> 02:33:44,004
went to college and the elite colleges 
in particular and who are of that 

3633
02:33:46,291 --> 02:33:49,980
culture that's created in those colleges
and those who are not of that culture.

3634
02:33:50,190 --> 02:33:52,020
That's what that.
That's what that election was about.

3635
02:33:52,200 --> 02:33:53,033
I think there is this schism between 
those two groups in this country and 

3636
02:33:57,751 --> 02:33:58,584
that finally the people who are not of 
the elite college culture one something 

3637
02:34:02,910 --> 02:34:06,330
and it caused the elites to freak 
completely out.

3638
02:34:06,870 --> 02:34:07,703
So if you look at,
like I was looking at the top podcast 

3639
02:34:11,191 --> 02:34:12,024
because I just started a podcast and it 
did get ranked and so I'm excited but 

3640
02:34:14,611 --> 02:34:17,800
I'm looking at it a lot and like you can
really see it clearly to look at the top

3641
02:34:17,801 --> 02:34:18,130
200

3642
02:34:18,130 --> 02:34:22,600
podcasts right now.
It's like 60 to 70 percent are like NPR,

3643
02:34:23,290 --> 02:34:24,520
cookie cutter,
same shit.

3644
02:34:24,700 --> 02:34:27,370
Coastal elite,
liberal bland,

3645
02:34:27,520 --> 02:34:28,480
you know,
you know what it is,

3646
02:34:29,080 --> 02:34:31,000
tone of voice,
what they say,

3647
02:34:31,001 --> 02:34:32,260
who their guests are.
All the same.

3648
02:34:32,320 --> 02:34:33,550
You know exactly what it is,
right?

3649
02:34:33,970 --> 02:34:37,000
Is dominated by that.
But then there's you in there.

3650
02:34:37,090 --> 02:34:40,270
You're not that.
There's Sam Harris who sort of that,

3651
02:34:40,271 --> 02:34:41,680
but not really.
You know,

3652
02:34:41,980 --> 02:34:44,020
there's Dan Carlin here,
there's another one,

3653
02:34:44,170 --> 02:34:45,460
right?
He's part of this movement.

3654
02:34:45,461 --> 02:34:47,980
He doesn't have a school,
but he's teaching people history.

3655
02:34:48,040 --> 02:34:49,690
Oh fuck.
Teaching people history.

3656
02:34:49,780 --> 02:34:52,720
A lot of people history,
more people than any historic.

3657
02:34:52,770 --> 02:34:55,970
A Harvard professor will ever teach you 
more than any historian,

3658
02:34:55,980 --> 02:34:58,870
more way more.
He gets millions of downloads.

3659
02:34:58,890 --> 02:34:59,723
Way History lecture.
Is anybody in the numbers like millions 

3660
02:35:04,090 --> 02:35:05,170
producing?
Does he?

3661
02:35:05,171 --> 02:35:07,300
Is he a serious historian?
I've listened to him.

3662
02:35:07,360 --> 02:35:10,960
I'm a professionally trained historian,
Ivy League Phd.

3663
02:35:11,050 --> 02:35:12,130
Hell yeah.
He is.

3664
02:35:12,310 --> 02:35:13,660
You know,
I don't agree with everything,

3665
02:35:13,720 --> 02:35:16,750
but it doesn't matter.
He's doing serious academic,

3666
02:35:16,751 --> 02:35:20,740
professional,
important history and he is changing the

3667
02:35:20,741 --> 02:35:21,760
landscape.
I agree.

3668
02:35:21,790 --> 02:35:23,560
Okay.
He's on there,

3669
02:35:23,590 --> 02:35:25,400
so there's.
Some of us were there,

3670
02:35:25,430 --> 02:35:27,460
some of us we're making,
we're making it happen,

3671
02:35:27,461 --> 02:35:28,294
but you can just see as such a divide,
like there's just such a divide between 

3672
02:35:31,721 --> 02:35:32,554
like who,
who's on your podcast and who's on the 

3673
02:35:34,511 --> 02:35:37,870
NPR podcasts is hardly any crossover.
Yeah,

3674
02:35:37,871 --> 02:35:39,610
but that's just my choice.
Interesting.

3675
02:35:39,670 --> 02:35:40,503
That could know those people.
There's a lot of people that I get that 

3676
02:35:42,821 --> 02:35:43,654
are on NPR podcasts.
My point is that there's sort of two 

3677
02:35:46,211 --> 02:35:48,910
different cultures that's happening 
right now.

3678
02:35:49,240 --> 02:35:50,073
There's just that culture like,
and this is kind of a problem with my 

3679
02:35:52,301 --> 02:35:54,340
girlfriend and I have because she's of 
that culture.

3680
02:35:54,370 --> 02:35:56,560
Most of the people I know are npr types,
you know,

3681
02:35:56,561 --> 02:35:57,400
that's what they want to hear.

3682
02:35:57,400 --> 02:35:58,850
It's comforting and soothing,
whatever.

3683
02:35:58,851 --> 02:35:59,980
It makes them feel good.
I don't know,

3684
02:36:00,610 --> 02:36:02,230
but they're really.
That's who they are.

3685
02:36:02,231 --> 02:36:05,320
Fundamentally.
It's like their identity and then,

3686
02:36:05,560 --> 02:36:06,393
you know,
when they hear your podcast or my 

3687
02:36:08,681 --> 02:36:11,320
podcast or anyone's,
it's,

3688
02:36:11,660 --> 02:36:15,430
it's like,
it's like a punk rock to a 80 year old.

3689
02:36:15,550 --> 02:36:17,290
It's just hard.
It's just different culture,

3690
02:36:17,440 --> 02:36:19,090
different language,
different way of behaving,

3691
02:36:19,091 --> 02:36:22,360
different ideas or questions,
different questions are asked.

3692
02:36:23,440 --> 02:36:25,420
Um,
and there's,

3693
02:36:26,080 --> 02:36:28,720
there's this resentment to,
because the elites,

3694
02:36:28,750 --> 02:36:32,050
the MPR types I believe have basically 
looked,

3695
02:36:32,080 --> 02:36:32,913
not basically they have looked down 
their noses at those who didn't go to 

3696
02:36:36,371 --> 02:36:38,830
college who don't speak the way we 
speak,

3697
02:36:39,400 --> 02:36:42,610
who don't talk about these ideas,
who aren't aware of these ideas.

3698
02:36:42,640 --> 02:36:43,473
Right?
Working class people like people in 

3699
02:36:44,561 --> 02:36:46,360
Salem.
I know people who,

3700
02:36:46,390 --> 02:36:47,230
Oh,
you know,

3701
02:36:47,350 --> 02:36:49,570
Meryl Streep said at best,
right about mma,

3702
02:36:50,080 --> 02:36:50,913
right St.
that's,

3703
02:36:50,920 --> 02:36:51,753
that was it right there.
They clearly see all those people 

3704
02:36:55,841 --> 02:36:59,980
outside this elite by coastal culture as
doing bad stuff,

3705
02:36:59,981 --> 02:37:00,814
inferior stuff,
and they shouldn't be allowed to run 

3706
02:37:02,441 --> 02:37:03,274
things.
She said was so inherently ridiculous 

3707
02:37:05,500 --> 02:37:06,333
and also ignorant because she was also 
claiming that if you take out the 

3708
02:37:09,371 --> 02:37:10,870
immigrants,
you're left with mma.

3709
02:37:11,500 --> 02:37:13,870
MMA is 80 percent immigrants.
Sure.

3710
02:37:14,280 --> 02:37:15,113
Literally.
Well,

3711
02:37:15,340 --> 02:37:16,173
what she said was,

3712
02:37:16,370 --> 02:37:17,780
was stupid,
ignorant,

3713
02:37:17,781 --> 02:37:21,290
and more importantly,
I think classist in that way.

3714
02:37:21,291 --> 02:37:22,124
Right?
It's like,

3715
02:37:22,520 --> 02:37:25,010
you're not smart enough.
You're not good enough.

3716
02:37:25,011 --> 02:37:25,844
She's so wrong.
Like there's a lot of Americans that 

3717
02:37:27,831 --> 02:37:28,664
engaged now in May for sure,
but there's so many great fighters that 

3718
02:37:32,901 --> 02:37:34,880
are immigrants.
I mean a massive,

3719
02:37:34,910 --> 02:37:36,960
massive amounts.
It's not small mouth,

3720
02:37:37,210 --> 02:37:38,043
so she was saying,
take out all the immigrants you left 

3721
02:37:39,441 --> 02:37:41,240
with mma.
That is so dumb,

3722
02:37:41,260 --> 02:37:43,120
but you know what those people do with 
the.

3723
02:37:43,170 --> 02:37:46,400
The immigrants who do things like mma,
they ignore them.

3724
02:37:47,210 --> 02:37:49,730
They pretend.
They pretend they don't exist.

3725
02:37:49,731 --> 02:37:51,040
It doesn't fit the narrow narrative.
Yeah.

3726
02:37:51,370 --> 02:37:54,020
Is the immigrant who also very much 
exists.

3727
02:37:54,021 --> 02:37:54,854
They want the undocumented mom with the 
kid who got stopped at the border and 

3728
02:37:57,771 --> 02:37:59,690
sent back.
Who breaks my heart too?

3729
02:37:59,790 --> 02:38:00,630
Yeah,
my two.

3730
02:38:00,810 --> 02:38:03,120
Absolutely,
but they want them only to be what?

3731
02:38:03,150 --> 02:38:05,110
Victims.
What's the solution to that?

3732
02:38:05,120 --> 02:38:05,953
That they can say,
what is the solution to illegal 

3733
02:38:07,111 --> 02:38:09,480
immigration in this country?
Do you just let everybody in?

3734
02:38:09,540 --> 02:38:10,780
I'm an open border sky.
Yeah.

3735
02:38:10,980 --> 02:38:11,813
Open borders.
Just let anybody in who wants to come 

3736
02:38:13,501 --> 02:38:14,334
meeting of inventions and social 
constructs that have done great harm to 

3737
02:38:16,381 --> 02:38:17,550
humanity.
Borders,

3738
02:38:17,580 --> 02:38:18,550
borders.
Yeah.

3739
02:38:18,960 --> 02:38:21,630
I agree that eventually that's going to 
be a thing of the past.

3740
02:38:21,631 --> 02:38:25,350
I think there'll be a looked back when 
we look back at history.

3741
02:38:25,420 --> 02:38:29,600
It'll be thought of as one of the most 
barbaric ideas,

3742
02:38:29,610 --> 02:38:30,570
right?
Can you imagine?

3743
02:38:30,590 --> 02:38:34,020
Let's say it's barbaric and the way that
it used to be that you had a tribe,

3744
02:38:34,021 --> 02:38:34,854
then you invaded another tribe or they 
invaded you and you had to put up a 

3745
02:38:37,531 --> 02:38:38,364
fence and guard your border and then 
these things became like larger 

3746
02:38:40,891 --> 02:38:41,724
communities as communities became.
Cities became countries became and then 

3747
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:45,833
you go back a few thousand years.
You're dealing with these countries 

3748
02:38:49,351 --> 02:38:51,840
invading other countries and so you have
these,

3749
02:38:52,290 --> 02:38:52,950
these,
uh,

3750
02:38:52,950 --> 02:38:53,783
immigration policies,
especially now where we have border 

3751
02:38:56,100 --> 02:38:59,220
patrols and this idea that you have to 
have your paperwork and you have to have

3752
02:38:59,580 --> 02:39:00,413
passports and numbers and otherwise you,
you were born in the wrong patch of 

3753
02:39:02,971 --> 02:39:03,720
dirt.
Sir.

3754
02:39:03,720 --> 02:39:07,350
If you were just born 30 miles north,
you could have been in Texas,

3755
02:39:07,351 --> 02:39:08,970
but you're in Juarez.
You fuck,

3756
02:39:08,971 --> 02:39:10,860
so you stay over here.
It's,

3757
02:39:10,890 --> 02:39:11,570
it's silly.

3758
02:39:11,570 --> 02:39:12,403
Speaking of social constructions and 
social constructions that have changed 

3759
02:39:15,261 --> 02:39:16,600
over time,
right?

3760
02:39:16,601 --> 02:39:20,210
It's damn telling a Mexican they can't 
come here.

3761
02:39:20,540 --> 02:39:23,240
Are you crazy like this was Mexico five 
minutes ago.

3762
02:39:23,241 --> 02:39:24,074
You assholes.
Who the fuck are you finishing the 

3763
02:39:26,241 --> 02:39:29,870
arrogance of Americans who think that 
Mexicans have no place here?

3764
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,240
I mean,
there weren't no white people here long.

3765
02:39:32,440 --> 02:39:33,380
Well,
it not only that,

3766
02:39:33,381 --> 02:39:34,214
I mean you just got lucky you're,
you were born into this like 

3767
02:39:36,681 --> 02:39:41,540
economically prov promising area where 
you know,

3768
02:39:41,541 --> 02:39:43,230
you gotta better opportunities.
Sure.

3769
02:39:43,280 --> 02:39:46,370
And you're looking at these people that 
are born in a shit spot and you're like,

3770
02:39:46,371 --> 02:39:47,990
well,
you're in that shit spot forever.

3771
02:39:48,260 --> 02:39:50,210
You can't come over here and take my 
good spot.

3772
02:39:50,270 --> 02:39:51,103
It also works against us because then it
becomes harder for us to travel 

3773
02:39:54,321 --> 02:39:56,330
elsewhere because then they have 
borders.

3774
02:39:56,570 --> 02:39:58,580
They don't like Americans because of 
what we do to them.

3775
02:39:58,790 --> 02:40:01,220
When I go to Mexico in a,
I just like,

3776
02:40:02,060 --> 02:40:04,400
I love it there and I keep thinking,
man,

3777
02:40:04,670 --> 02:40:05,503
it's amazing that you're treating me 
this well because the Mexicans are so 

3778
02:40:07,730 --> 02:40:08,720
kind.
Generally,

3779
02:40:08,721 --> 02:40:09,980
you know,
when you're down there and like,

3780
02:40:09,981 --> 02:40:11,420
God,
you should hate Americans.

3781
02:40:11,480 --> 02:40:12,313
Wha What we've done to them in terms of 
the border integration and that drug 

3782
02:40:15,361 --> 02:40:16,620
war.
I mean,

3783
02:40:17,400 --> 02:40:21,900
the deaths,
the poverty that we've inflicted on them

3784
02:40:21,901 --> 02:40:24,600
through these laws are shitty policy.
My God,

3785
02:40:24,660 --> 02:40:27,090
I mean they have every reason to hate 
our guts and they don't.

3786
02:40:27,520 --> 02:40:28,081
Yeah,
well no.

3787
02:40:28,081 --> 02:40:31,260
Mexicans overall are very kind people.
My parents live in Mexico.

3788
02:40:31,320 --> 02:40:32,030
Really?
Yeah.

3789
02:40:32,030 --> 02:40:32,761
I didn't know that.
Yeah.

3790
02:40:32,761 --> 02:40:33,420
I love Mexico.

3791
02:40:33,420 --> 02:40:34,253
I love it.
I going to Mexico all the time and 

3792
02:40:34,900 --> 02:40:38,070
credible place.
I try to go out of my favorite places to

3793
02:40:38,071 --> 02:40:40,560
go on vacation for sure.
And I know a lot of people.

3794
02:40:40,620 --> 02:40:42,390
I have a lot of friends here.
They're scared.

3795
02:40:42,450 --> 02:40:43,283
They're scared of Mexico.
I think Mexico is all gang violence and 

3796
02:40:45,361 --> 02:40:46,194
all that.
I'm like,

3797
02:40:46,290 --> 02:40:48,090
wow,
read about Chicago.

3798
02:40:48,120 --> 02:40:52,260
You're not scared to go to Chicago.
Chicago was fucking murders every day.

3799
02:40:52,410 --> 02:40:55,260
That's a good point.
I want to trump Chicago,

3800
02:40:55,740 --> 02:40:56,573
Mexico violence.
You know what he was saying about these 

3801
02:40:59,090 --> 02:41:01,500
illegal immigrants being violent 
criminals and stuff.

3802
02:41:01,650 --> 02:41:03,750
He wasn't wrong entirely.
A,

3803
02:41:03,810 --> 02:41:04,643
here's what.
Here's what people are ignoring that 

3804
02:41:06,480 --> 02:41:10,080
it's true that the cartels have moved 
into the Midwest.

3805
02:41:10,670 --> 02:41:12,450
You know about this in particular 
Chicago,

3806
02:41:12,580 --> 02:41:13,413
that Chapo and others too.
They have moved into the Midwest there 

3807
02:41:15,781 --> 02:41:16,614
in Kentucky.
Do a google search for like Mexican 

3808
02:41:19,021 --> 02:41:22,290
cartel and pick like a town in Kentucky 
and Ohio,

3809
02:41:22,291 --> 02:41:22,770
Indiana.

3810
02:41:22,770 --> 02:41:24,960
They're all over the midwest and they're
competing.

3811
02:41:24,961 --> 02:41:25,794
They're kicking out the old gangs and 
that's why there's all this violence on 

3812
02:41:28,801 --> 02:41:31,290
the streets.
A lot of those black kids in Chicago who

3813
02:41:31,291 --> 02:41:35,370
are shooting each other are working for 
one of those cartels basically,

3814
02:41:35,730 --> 02:41:36,563
so trump was right about that,
but he's totally wrong about the answer 

3815
02:41:38,701 --> 02:41:41,460
to it and what liberals do in response 
to it is even worse,

3816
02:41:41,461 --> 02:41:43,530
which is pretend it's not happening.
Yeah,

3817
02:41:43,531 --> 02:41:44,760
no,
people are killing each other,

3818
02:41:44,910 --> 02:41:46,170
but why?
Why?

3819
02:41:46,350 --> 02:41:48,320
Because drugs are illegal.
Yes,

3820
02:41:48,750 --> 02:41:51,480
because drugs are illegal and we want 
them to be illegal.

3821
02:41:51,840 --> 02:41:53,460
We vote for those laws.
Well,

3822
02:41:53,461 --> 02:41:54,294
I met a guy in Chicago who was a cop and
he explained it to me in great detail 

3823
02:41:59,460 --> 02:42:02,970
and he said essentially what happened is
they moved in and they arrested a lot of

3824
02:42:02,971 --> 02:42:03,804
these drug lords,
these local people that were in charge 

3825
02:42:06,721 --> 02:42:10,530
of whatever areas and they were running 
whatever criminal organization.

3826
02:42:10,740 --> 02:42:13,920
They arrest them and they created a 
power vacuum and the way he was saying,

3827
02:42:13,921 --> 02:42:14,754
he's like,
it's no different than when we remove a 

3828
02:42:15,511 --> 02:42:16,344
dictator in some foreign country that 
people move in and then it creates 

3829
02:42:19,171 --> 02:42:20,310
violence.
You get isis.

3830
02:42:20,340 --> 02:42:21,780
Exactly,
exactly.

3831
02:42:21,840 --> 02:42:22,531
Yeah.
So,

3832
02:42:22,531 --> 02:42:24,060
but you don't hear people talking about 
this.

3833
02:42:24,090 --> 02:42:25,080
Right.
It's incredible.

3834
02:42:25,081 --> 02:42:26,100
That's what's going on.
Yes.

3835
02:42:26,101 --> 02:42:27,450
The cartels are here.
Yes.

3836
02:42:27,451 --> 02:42:28,284
Trump has drugs.
Really trump is too god damn dumb to 

3837
02:42:30,181 --> 02:42:31,014
make the full point and he's also 
beholden to these asshole republicans 

3838
02:42:34,261 --> 02:42:37,050
like jeff sessions who thinks that I 
think that marijuana is dangerous.

3839
02:42:37,110 --> 02:42:40,020
He wants to bring back.
So he's not saying he's not.

3840
02:42:40,021 --> 02:42:40,854
He has no idea,
or at least he's not saying what the 

3841
02:42:42,031 --> 02:42:43,620
actual causes.
Right.

3842
02:42:43,770 --> 02:42:46,740
And Liberals are sort of a betting him 
by ignoring it,

3843
02:42:46,741 --> 02:42:47,131
but saying,
well no,

3844
02:42:47,131 --> 02:42:50,100
there is no violence.
It's like no fuckers.

3845
02:42:50,100 --> 02:42:54,480
There is tremendous violence and that 
cause is your laws against drugs.

3846
02:42:54,860 --> 02:42:57,390
Right?
So the answer is really simple.

3847
02:42:58,370 --> 02:42:59,600
It's in glass trucks.
Yeah.

3848
02:42:59,820 --> 02:43:00,541
Yeah.
So,

3849
02:43:00,541 --> 02:43:01,374
but because,
because our government is just a fight 

3850
02:43:03,301 --> 02:43:07,560
between this moron trump and these 
morons,

3851
02:43:07,561 --> 02:43:10,260
the Democrats who refused to address 
this stuff,

3852
02:43:10,830 --> 02:43:13,600
there's no discussion about it.
But if you do legalized drugs,

3853
02:43:13,601 --> 02:43:14,434
like how do you do that?
Like say if the United States just 

3854
02:43:16,601 --> 02:43:17,434
decided we're going to decriminalize all
drugs and now that's not good enough 

3855
02:43:20,711 --> 02:43:22,390
because someone's going to sell them.
Right?

3856
02:43:22,391 --> 02:43:23,224
You can't just decriminalize them,
but that just keeps people from getting 

3857
02:43:25,481 --> 02:43:27,370
arrested,
which is a great step.

3858
02:43:27,550 --> 02:43:29,620
A good,
a good move in the right direction.

3859
02:43:29,890 --> 02:43:34,450
There's some insane number of people in 
America that are in prison right now for

3860
02:43:34,451 --> 02:43:36,150
nonviolent drug offenses.
Yeah,

3861
02:43:36,370 --> 02:43:38,260
it's a,
it's a nutty number.

3862
02:43:38,290 --> 02:43:40,870
That's a side note,
but a really important one.

3863
02:43:40,930 --> 02:43:43,840
There is now a debate among academics 
who study this stuff,

3864
02:43:44,220 --> 02:43:45,053
uh,
and a lot of academics who are actually 

3865
02:43:46,301 --> 02:43:49,490
more or less on the right side of this 
are arguing that the drug war and,

3866
02:43:50,020 --> 02:43:50,853
and making drugs illegal is not the 
major cause of mass incarceration 

3867
02:43:54,070 --> 02:43:57,040
because the number,
the percentage of people it is big,

3868
02:43:57,041 --> 02:43:59,950
but it's something like 10 percent who 
are nonviolent drug offenders who were,

3869
02:44:00,040 --> 02:44:03,970
who were prosecuted and convicted of 
just drug offenses.

3870
02:44:04,480 --> 02:44:07,570
That is a relatively small number,
but what they're not taking into account

3871
02:44:07,690 --> 02:44:12,690
is all of the other crimes that stem 
from drugs being illegal.

3872
02:44:14,261 --> 02:44:15,720
Right?
So all the murders,

3873
02:44:15,721 --> 02:44:17,050
all the assault,
the violent take,

3874
02:44:17,051 --> 02:44:18,670
all the homicides in this country.
Right.

3875
02:44:19,060 --> 02:44:19,893
I want to see a number,
but I'm sure it's really high of how 

3876
02:44:22,061 --> 02:44:24,940
many were committed by a gang member.
Okay.

3877
02:44:25,150 --> 02:44:25,983
And how many of the gangs in the United 
States basically started by selling 

3878
02:44:28,691 --> 02:44:29,460
drugs?

3879
02:44:29,460 --> 02:44:30,293
Right,
right.

3880
02:44:30,370 --> 02:44:32,380
Okay.
There's that homicides,

3881
02:44:32,440 --> 02:44:34,330
assault gangs,
drugs,

3882
02:44:34,600 --> 02:44:35,433
there is larceny theft.
People who are hooked on drugs who are 

3883
02:44:38,471 --> 02:44:42,490
broke in large part because drug prices 
are so high.

3884
02:44:42,550 --> 02:44:45,160
Why are they so high?
Because they're illegal.

3885
02:44:45,670 --> 02:44:46,503
Right,
right.

3886
02:44:46,600 --> 02:44:49,120
They have to get them on.
The black market always raises prices,

3887
02:44:49,270 --> 02:44:51,460
so they're forced to steal because 
they're poor people.

3888
02:44:51,730 --> 02:44:52,563
Right.
So a huge percentage and they don't 

3889
02:44:54,191 --> 02:44:58,240
track this because the convictions are,
you know,

3890
02:44:58,241 --> 02:44:59,074
if it's,
if it's a junkie who steals from 

3891
02:45:01,091 --> 02:45:05,830
somebody to score,
they don't count that as a drug crime.

3892
02:45:05,860 --> 02:45:08,110
They counted as just Larson a.
So we don't know,

3893
02:45:08,111 --> 02:45:08,944
but I am sure,
and this is what social scientists need 

3894
02:45:10,301 --> 02:45:11,134
to do right now is start to make that,
do that work and find out exactly how 

3895
02:45:14,051 --> 02:45:14,884
many people are in prison for some 
reason related to the fact that drugs 

3896
02:45:18,761 --> 02:45:21,220
are illegal and a Betcha it's a huge 
number.

3897
02:45:21,460 --> 02:45:22,360
Yeah,
I bet you're right.

3898
02:45:22,540 --> 02:45:26,050
It's also like these gangs,
if they don't sell drugs,

3899
02:45:26,080 --> 02:45:26,913
they have no other method of income 
because they're just knocking over 

3900
02:45:29,981 --> 02:45:32,260
trucks filled with equipment and then 
reselling it.

3901
02:45:32,261 --> 02:45:33,130
Like where,
what are they doing?

3902
02:45:33,160 --> 02:45:34,390
They have no income.
They have no power.

3903
02:45:34,420 --> 02:45:35,220
Exactly.
Right.

3904
02:45:35,220 --> 02:45:36,053
Yeah.
So I mean the mafia in the 19 twenties 

3905
02:45:38,471 --> 02:45:41,200
was enormously powerful.
Hugely powerful.

3906
02:45:41,201 --> 02:45:42,940
Why?
Because the prohibition.

3907
02:45:42,941 --> 02:45:44,830
Exactly.
So that's you take away.

3908
02:45:44,831 --> 02:45:46,180
I said,
I've said this to people like,

3909
02:45:46,390 --> 02:45:47,560
um,
what was,

3910
02:45:47,561 --> 02:45:50,090
um,
the great netflix series was about him,

3911
02:45:50,100 --> 02:45:52,170
the huge drug.
No champion.

3912
02:45:53,490 --> 02:45:54,323
Narcos.
Yup.

3913
02:45:54,410 --> 02:45:57,970
It goes,
was named Paul Escobar Escobar Escobar.

3914
02:45:57,971 --> 02:46:01,270
So take make drugs you make.
If drugs were legal,

3915
02:46:02,110 --> 02:46:05,950
how many people did Escobar kill?
None or two or one or something,

3916
02:46:05,951 --> 02:46:07,630
right?
I mean he killed thousands of people.

3917
02:46:08,020 --> 02:46:09,620
Right?
But if they're legal,

3918
02:46:09,650 --> 02:46:10,040
here's the

3919
02:46:10,040 --> 02:46:13,070
deal,
like who's profiting off of those?

3920
02:46:13,071 --> 02:46:14,720
Right.
That's where it gets really slippery.

3921
02:46:14,960 --> 02:46:18,560
If you make drugs legal and then there's
got to be,

3922
02:46:18,561 --> 02:46:19,394
like right now,
the people that are selling them are 

3923
02:46:20,961 --> 02:46:21,830
criminals,
right?

3924
02:46:21,970 --> 02:46:23,240
If they're not,
if you make it illegal,

3925
02:46:23,241 --> 02:46:24,074
they're going to still sell them.
Like they're just going to sell them 

3926
02:46:25,641 --> 02:46:26,660
legally.
Like,

3927
02:46:26,700 --> 02:46:27,533
like how do you make this transition 
between drugs being legal and then 

3928
02:46:32,151 --> 02:46:34,850
people being able to sell them.
Like how does that work?

3929
02:46:35,090 --> 02:46:35,923
How do you do that in an orderly way?
How do you preserve sanity and humanity 

3930
02:46:39,471 --> 02:46:40,940
and civilization?
What do you mean?

3931
02:46:40,980 --> 02:46:41,751
Nineteen,
33.

3932
02:46:41,751 --> 02:46:42,990
They ended prohibition.
Yeah.

3933
02:46:42,991 --> 02:46:45,560
But alcohol was something that did 
though.

3934
02:46:45,990 --> 02:46:47,990
What's that?
They regulated it heavily.

3935
02:46:48,230 --> 02:46:50,930
[inaudible],
which made which created new problems,

3936
02:46:51,460 --> 02:46:54,860
it caused the state to be all up in our 
business and all sorts of ways,

3937
02:46:54,861 --> 02:46:59,030
so like you had to get licensed to sell 
alcohol,

3938
02:46:59,040 --> 02:46:59,480
right?

3939
02:46:59,480 --> 02:47:00,313
Which is what that meant was an 
inspector from the state came to your 

3940
02:47:03,141 --> 02:47:03,974
bar or restaurant or whatever and looked
around and asked you questions and 

3941
02:47:07,071 --> 02:47:09,020
checked on who we're hiring,
who worked there,

3942
02:47:09,050 --> 02:47:11,240
who your customers were,
what kinds of customers,

3943
02:47:11,660 --> 02:47:16,430
and if you didn't fit all the rules of 
polite society or in.

3944
02:47:16,431 --> 02:47:17,264
This was true.
Great histories have been done about 

3945
02:47:18,741 --> 02:47:19,574
this.
If you had the homosexuals coming into 

3946
02:47:22,041 --> 02:47:23,020
your bar,
Oh,

3947
02:47:23,030 --> 02:47:23,863
drunk,
homos.

3948
02:47:23,900 --> 02:47:27,470
You don't want that for the prostitutes 
or the prostitutes coming into your bar,

3949
02:47:27,860 --> 02:47:30,320
or even women who were a little bit 
loose with their morality.

3950
02:47:30,321 --> 02:47:31,880
You didn't get a license.
Really?

3951
02:47:31,940 --> 02:47:32,773
Yes.
Women could stop you from getting a bar 

3952
02:47:34,191 --> 02:47:35,180
license.
Absolutely.

3953
02:47:35,600 --> 02:47:36,433
Boy,
I don't know what kind of world we live 

3954
02:47:37,941 --> 02:47:40,850
in telling you,
so just decriminalize.

3955
02:47:40,970 --> 02:47:41,803
We will be fine,
but if you just decriminalized who's 

3956
02:47:43,311 --> 02:47:44,450
selling it,
right,

3957
02:47:44,451 --> 02:47:46,160
it's still going to be illegal to sell.

3958
02:47:46,190 --> 02:47:47,001
No.
Right.

3959
02:47:47,001 --> 02:47:51,000
Decriminalization doesn't mean 
legalization in terms of profitability,

3960
02:47:51,550 --> 02:47:52,520
right?
Mexico.

3961
02:47:52,521 --> 02:47:55,580
Do you know that all drugs essentially 
or decriminalized in Mexico,

3962
02:47:55,581 --> 02:47:57,800
including mushrooms,
acid.

3963
02:47:58,100 --> 02:48:01,430
These are those definitions changed 
according to the industry,

3964
02:48:01,431 --> 02:48:02,264
which is a pain in the ass.
But so sometimes decrim means just no 

3965
02:48:04,881 --> 02:48:06,140
laws at all.
No,

3966
02:48:06,250 --> 02:48:10,010
none.
Legalization usually means not always,

3967
02:48:10,011 --> 02:48:12,780
but usually means regulations.
Like what happened with.

3968
02:48:13,480 --> 02:48:14,930
Yeah.
So like with weed,

3969
02:48:14,990 --> 02:48:15,823
we've got legal,
we've got legalized and it's heavily 

3970
02:48:18,021 --> 02:48:18,854
regulated and Cetera,
but it also was not that heavily were 

3971
02:48:20,930 --> 02:48:23,120
regulated in Colorado it's pretty easy 
to get.

3972
02:48:23,140 --> 02:48:25,970
I thought it was while the regulation 
comes in the banking,

3973
02:48:26,270 --> 02:48:27,103
the banking is weird because the federal
government still has it classified as a 

3974
02:48:29,871 --> 02:48:33,030
schedule one substance and it's illegal.
So there's a huge issue isn't it?

3975
02:48:33,170 --> 02:48:34,003
For people having an accept cash only.
So they hired a bunch of seals and 

3976
02:48:36,971 --> 02:48:38,630
burkes and all these fucking guys from 
like,

3977
02:48:38,900 --> 02:48:41,960
you know,
that would have probably worked for like

3978
02:48:42,200 --> 02:48:43,033
a mercenary organizations.
Now they're fucking Karen round drug 

3979
02:48:45,831 --> 02:48:49,280
money from people selling pot and then 
they have to take it to the bank and put

3980
02:48:49,281 --> 02:48:50,114
it in safe deposit boxes.
And deposited into these accounts in 

3981
02:48:52,910 --> 02:48:55,070
weird ways.
It's very fucking.

3982
02:48:55,200 --> 02:48:56,033
It's really problematic.
And that keeps a lot of people out of 

3983
02:48:58,371 --> 02:49:00,610
the market,
out of participating in this.

3984
02:49:00,670 --> 02:49:02,530
It hire soldiers,
you know,

3985
02:49:02,900 --> 02:49:04,850
stuff that peaceful unemployment 
program.

3986
02:49:04,860 --> 02:49:06,470
That's great.
That's what we need more,

3987
02:49:06,520 --> 02:49:07,920
more hired.
Uh,

3988
02:49:08,280 --> 02:49:11,650
isn't it true that they give them jobs?
You don't want them not having jobs.

3989
02:49:11,651 --> 02:49:12,484
And that's true.
Once you teach people how to kill 

3990
02:49:13,501 --> 02:49:14,700
people,
we'll be nice to them.

3991
02:49:14,701 --> 02:49:17,420
I certainly would rather them do that.
Then killing Iraqis,

3992
02:49:18,610 --> 02:49:19,443
they also disallowed people with prior 
felonies from participating in the 

3993
02:49:24,271 --> 02:49:25,080
industry.
Is that true?

3994
02:49:25,080 --> 02:49:28,230
In Colorado,
which I've seen this and that meant it's

3995
02:49:28,410 --> 02:49:29,900
all white.
I do not know that.

3996
02:49:29,910 --> 02:49:31,020
All the,
all the.

3997
02:49:31,080 --> 02:49:34,000
Well there's a lot of black producers.
Celanese racist bastard.

3998
02:49:34,470 --> 02:49:36,170
How dare you got assigned to you?
That was a,

3999
02:49:36,240 --> 02:49:38,340
that was a complete,
like Huffington post item,

4000
02:49:38,341 --> 02:49:39,240
I just know.
Right.

4001
02:49:40,250 --> 02:49:41,940
And you call it racist.
Wow.

4002
02:49:41,941 --> 02:49:44,640
I don't know what to do now.
Have a system or a salon.

4003
02:49:44,670 --> 02:49:47,250
It's kind of a salon.com.
Not Man.

4004
02:49:47,490 --> 02:49:48,870
I'm all right,
man.

4005
02:49:48,871 --> 02:49:50,690
We did just did three hours am.
No Way.

4006
02:49:50,880 --> 02:49:52,160
Flew by letting before 30.

4007
02:49:52,160 --> 02:49:52,993
Global.
Yeah.

4008
02:49:53,400 --> 02:49:56,670
Time flies when you're having fun.
Tell everybody what your podcast is.

4009
02:49:56,800 --> 02:49:58,200
Tell everybody where they can get it.
Cool.

4010
02:49:58,740 --> 02:49:59,670
Yeah.
I've got a few things going on,

4011
02:49:59,671 --> 02:50:01,830
but yeah,

4012

Top 50 and news and politics right now,
and then I got renegade university.

4016
02:50:12,241 --> 02:50:15,390
I got an event coming up in 
Massachusetts in August.

4017
02:50:15,420 --> 02:50:17,400
Joe's old stomping grounds.

Massachusetts.

4019
02:50:19,080 --> 02:50:21,660
What are you doing out there?
It's a weekend and burning witches.

4020
02:50:21,720 --> 02:50:23,850
Whole weekend.

4021
02:50:23,851 --> 02:50:24,684
I'm talking about history and theory and
politics and all weekend and I've 

4022

already sold out the VIP,
but there's more.

4023
02:50:29,620 --> 02:50:30,453
The general admission is still on sale 
and then I'm doing that with a great 

4024
02:50:32,581 --> 02:50:33,870
group,
which I meant to mention.

4025
02:50:34,170 --> 02:50:36,960
School sucks.
Project who was actually one of the very

4026
02:50:36,961 --> 02:50:37,794
first pioneers of this whole movement I 
was talking about to just overthrow the 

4027
02:50:40,951 --> 02:50:41,784
whole educational system and replace it 
with actual thought and ideas and 

4028
02:50:44,401 --> 02:50:44,860
debate.

4029
02:50:44,860 --> 02:50:46,660
Who is running this?
His name is Brett [inaudible],

4030
02:50:46,690 --> 02:50:47,523
not great guy.
He's been doing is just running a 

4031
02:50:48,331 --> 02:50:49,280
podcast.
He was just,

4032
02:50:49,410 --> 02:50:51,990
he was a teacher in New Hampshire and he
just,

4033
02:50:51,991 --> 02:50:55,050
he was too smart for that system and got
sick of it and he left and said,

4034
02:50:55,051 --> 02:50:57,060
I'm just going to do a podcast.
You had no platform,

4035

got this huge following and you talk to
