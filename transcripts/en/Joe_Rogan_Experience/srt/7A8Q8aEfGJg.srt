1
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:03,900
Four,
three,

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,790
two,
one.

3
00:00:05,791 --> 00:00:07,230
Yes.
Mick West.

4
00:00:07,231 --> 00:00:09,690
We are alive finally.
Are you ready?

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:10,950
I am ready.
Let's do it.

6
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,020
Until you're getting a lot of heat 
online from all these.

7
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,440
It's all the flat earth people and the 
chem trail people.

8
00:00:16,441 --> 00:00:18,120
Those are the people that are mad at you
the most.

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,870
That's my specialty.
Chem trails and flutter.

10
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,260
Yeah.
Well that's.

11
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,070
I ask people.
This is hilarious.

12
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,170
I asked people online,
I said,

13
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:30,990
I'm mick west from Medibank is going to 
be here.

14
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:36,230
What would you like me to debunk?
And one of the first ones was chem 

15
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,740
trails because you cannot debunk it.
It's real Dun Dun,

16
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,250
Duh.
I would do.

17
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,370
I would say this to anybody who thinks 
that that has got to be the most 

18
00:00:46,621 --> 00:00:49,740
ineffective government program of all 
time.

19
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,280
Like he asked people what they're doing 
things in the sky and the number one 

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,540
thing they'll say is like weather 
control.

21
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,070
Weather controls one.
Well they don't have any fucking control

22
00:01:00,071 --> 00:01:05,071
of the weather because if they did 
they'd make it rain all over Santa 

23
00:01:05,071 --> 00:01:05,071
Barbara and stop these fires.
Yeah,

24
00:01:05,071 --> 00:01:09,260
I mean there's hundreds of millions of 
dollars where the damage going on right 

25
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:13,131
now,
there's a fire that's bigger than the 

26
00:01:13,131 --> 00:01:13,131
city of Washington DC.
They think they're making those bias.

27
00:01:13,131 --> 00:01:15,090
I think that that's part of the 
conspiracy.

28
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,680
Anything that happens is.
Oh,

29
00:01:16,681 --> 00:01:19,740
as part of the conspiracy,
what do you think it is?

30
00:01:19,741 --> 00:01:23,460
Like what is,
what is it with conspiracies,

31
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,640
like what,
why are they so attractive to people?

32
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,590
There's something going on with people,
right?

33
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,060
Yeah.
I think,

34
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:35,220
yeah,
I've been looking into this a lot and 

35
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,390
you have,
especially since you're a government 

36
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:38,390
show.
Well,

37
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:42,590
I'm doing research with a book on 
writing called escaping the rabbit hole 

38
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,441
and it's about how people get into the 
rabbit hole and how people get out of 

39
00:01:45,441 --> 00:01:48,711
the rabbit hole.
So the whole thing is about the rabbit 

40
00:01:48,711 --> 00:01:51,141
hole,
which is something basically people get 

41
00:01:51,141 --> 00:01:53,721
sucked into and I think people do a lot 
of research into the reasons behind 

42
00:01:53,721 --> 00:01:58,491
people getting into conspiracy theories 
like the psychological reasons and they 

43
00:01:58,491 --> 00:01:58,491
uh,
uh,

44
00:01:58,491 --> 00:02:00,150
personality reasons and things like 
that.

45
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,900
But I think most conspiracy theorists 
are just regular people.

46
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,810
They're just ordinary people who get 
sucked into something.

47
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,260
And why do you think that is?
Just from talking to them,

48
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:15,450
they tell me like the origin stories,
the origin stories essentially,

49
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,750
and they tell me what happened to them 
when they got into conspiracy theories 

50
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,200
and it nearly always starts with looking
at some video.

51
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:27,180
I now nowadays with them looking at some
video and then they just get sucked in.

52
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,660
Yeah.
And then they start looking at another 

53
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,071
video and another video and another 
video and facebook and youtube is 

54
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:36,990
feeding them these videos because once 
you start going down that road,

55
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,610
you just can't,
you can't change your trajectory.

56
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,030
It's hard to treat in Youtube,
uh,

57
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,570
since they instigated this,
uh,

58
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,120
uh,
autoplay thing or instituted this 

59
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,910
autoplay thing or the next video plays 
immediately and they're all related.

60
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,430
I think that's definitely been a thing 
with people.

61
00:02:57,431 --> 00:03:02,431
And also like the suggestions on right 
hand side if you're watching one video 

62
00:03:02,431 --> 00:03:02,431
in particular subject.
Yeah.

63
00:03:02,431 --> 00:03:05,770
Within some experiments with that set up
like a completely blank youtube account.

64
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:10,830
And I would just go in there and typing 
one thing like con trials and of course 

65
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:13,570
when you look at trails on youtube,
like half the videos,

66
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:15,400
you're going to get it going to be 
Kentrell videos.

67
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:19,270
And so if the first video you click on 
is the chem trail video,

68
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,760
then that just sets you down that road.
Well,

69
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:26,761
I remember this was in the days,
I think before youtube,

70
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,550
this is in the days when maybe youtube 
was around,

71
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:31,840
but it just wasn't that popular.

72
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:37,110
I remember me and my friend Eddie,
we're high as fuck and we're talking to 

73
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:41,491
my neighbor and there was some plane 
that was flying over and we were 

74
00:03:41,491 --> 00:03:43,810
wondering why the clouds coming from 
behind this plane's stood so long.

75
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,780
And so I asked him,
I said,

76
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,050
this neighbor,
I used to call them bling,

77
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:48,850
bling,
bling,

78
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:53,080
bling was incapable of talk about 
anything other than objects.

79
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,950
Like all we talk about that as a nice 
car.

80
00:03:54,951 --> 00:03:56,080
It's got a new car.
Would you get there?

81
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:57,250
Watch.
That was blank,

82
00:03:57,251 --> 00:04:02,251
blank.
All bling bling wanted to talk about is 

83
00:04:02,251 --> 00:04:02,251
like material possessions.
So.

84
00:04:02,251 --> 00:04:04,430
So he,
he knows were parked uh,

85
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,430
in front of his.
I was saying hi to them and I said,

86
00:04:06,431 --> 00:04:07,660
hey man,
do you remember clouds?

87
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,880
Look,
stick it around and this guy that long.

88
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,190
And he was like,
um,

89
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:11,920
no,
I don't know.

90
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:12,640
Is that a new truck?

91
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:17,700
And like,
I just remember how ironic it was 

92
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,970
because I had told Eddie about blink,
blink,

93
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:24,020
you know,
this is all this guy cares about and 

94
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,281
wants to talk about.
And then he did that while we're out 

95
00:04:26,281 --> 00:04:26,281
there.
But I remember thinking,

96
00:04:26,281 --> 00:04:28,840
man,
how weird would it be if all of a sudden

97
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,900
clouds from jet engines started 
appearing and it just appeared right 

98
00:04:34,031 --> 00:04:38,560
before our eyes and we had noticed it,
but I wasn't sold.

99
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:43,650
It didn't make any sense to me because 
my thought on it was the amount of 

100
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,770
people that had to be involved.
You're talking about all these different

101
00:04:44,771 --> 00:04:46,750
airplanes get all these people to keep 
their mouth shut.

102
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,030
These are their pilots,
right?

103
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:52,180
So they're not making shit tons of money
and they live here too.

104
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:57,181
That's the other thing,
like if there's actually spraying 

105
00:04:57,181 --> 00:04:57,181
something in the sky,
they live here too.

106
00:04:57,181 --> 00:04:59,760
Like what are they spraying themselves?
Well the theory now is the,

107
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:04,770
it's basically the power elite in the 
country is doing these chem trails as it

108
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,960
kinda latched last ditch attempt to 
maintain power before the entire world 

109
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,521
collapses into chaos.
So they think it's kind of like a 

110
00:05:14,521 --> 00:05:14,950
desperate situation.
A power grab.

111
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,370
Exactly.
It's,

112
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,180
it's the,
the hanging on to have that kind of last

113
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:20,510
hurrah.
I really,

114
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,390
they feel like the end of the world is 
nigh,

115
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,400
like,
you know this about to put this 

116
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:27,400
environmental disaster and the chem 
trails.

117
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,930
So the only thing that is holding 
everything together,

118
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,230
that's the thing that you get if you go 
to like,

119
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:32,610
you know,
gun geoengineering,

120
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,170
watch Dane Wigington Guy,
he,

121
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,530
he's basically a,
an apocalyptic prophet now.

122
00:05:38,531 --> 00:05:42,220
He's basically preaching about how 
everything is going to end soon.

123
00:05:42,221 --> 00:05:45,730
And the,
the chem trails of the only thing that's

124
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,220
stopping it,
but also making it worse.

125
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,840
So he's kind of saying like,
you know,

126
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:52,090
the controls are helping,
but we got to stop them.

127
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,070
Otherwise,
it'll make it even worse,

128
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,400
but we're pretty much all going to die 
either way because a lot of money and 

129
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,310
we're going to die.
There's a lot of people that love that,

130
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,400
that that trope is just like something 
that gets carted out constantly 

131
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,750
throughout history because it's true.
You are going to die.

132
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:10,430
It's like,
when are you going to die?

133
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,900
You don't know.
So because you don't know.

134
00:06:11,901 --> 00:06:12,890
You're freaking out.
Like,

135
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:15,380
is it going to be a car accident?
Is he going to be a fire?

136
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,770
Is going to be an earthquake,
is going to be a slow aging death,

137
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,410
or is it going to be the chem trails?
Yeah.

138
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:26,580
I think that type of thing,
like fear of dying is one of those 

139
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,261
fundamental things that every human is 
Khalid wide with certain things that 

140
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:34,620
they,
that happens in the brain without them 

141
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:34,620
thinking about and fear of dying and 
fear of other things,

142
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,280
fear of loss,
fear of wolves or whatever.

143
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:42,820
Something that's hardwired.
And that's the type of thing that leads 

144
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,090
to different types of thinking that,
uh,

145
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:48,610
you know,
you ended up being a conspiracy 

146
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:48,610
theorists in part because your brain is 
wired that way.

147
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:53,410
You had a great quote about chem trails 
when we did that television show 

148
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:56,561
together.
You said Chem trails are like the 

149
00:06:56,561 --> 00:06:57,740
training wheels for conspiracy theorists
because they're like,

150
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,680
they're,
they're right above your head and you're

151
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,150
just like,
you see them right there for people.

152
00:07:02,151 --> 00:07:07,040
Don't understand why jets produce 
clouds.

153
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,350
Please explain that because it's very 
simple.

154
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:13,700
It is very simple.
A jet engines have water.

155
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:18,830
I have water in their exhaust,
it can look at a car on a cold day and 

156
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,220
you see the exhaust coming out of the 
tailpipe.

157
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,400
You'll see like a cloud condensation 
sometimes and you'll see some water 

158
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,090
coming out.
And when they,

159
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,380
the exact same thing happens with jet 
engines.

160
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,410
Uh,
and when that exhaust hits,

161
00:07:30,411 --> 00:07:32,450
the colder it condenses,
it freezes,

162
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:35,420
it makes a cloud.
And Con controls are essentially,

163
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:39,020
clouds are exactly the same basically as
a regular service cloud.

164
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,620
And it's dependent upon the amount of 
moisture in the atmosphere.

165
00:07:42,621 --> 00:07:47,621
And you can actually monitor it online.
NASA actually has a website that will 

166
00:07:47,621 --> 00:07:50,090
show you,
and I believe it's set up for pilots,

167
00:07:50,091 --> 00:07:55,091
right?
Is that what the air traffic people are 

168
00:07:55,091 --> 00:07:57,590
actually has a contrail forecasting side
isn't really for pilots or anything.

169
00:07:57,591 --> 00:08:00,110
It's just part of the country research.
Uh,

170
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:05,170
but yeah,
they have a site where it will predict 

171
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:05,170
like,
well controls.

172
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:05,170
They're going to baby.
You can do it yourself.

173
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,980
You just go to look up the relative 
humidity at a certain altitude.

174
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,960
There's lots of different sites you can 
go to.

175
00:08:08,961 --> 00:08:13,961
I've got a whole bunch of them listed on
Medibank and just like the clouds very 

176
00:08:14,241 --> 00:08:19,241
in the sky,
all the amount of moisture various as 

177
00:08:19,241 --> 00:08:20,240
well,
which is one of the reasons why you will

178
00:08:20,241 --> 00:08:23,960
see a jet pass through one area and 
you'll see a contrail.

179
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,080
And then it almost looks like they shut 
the contrail jets off and then you see 

180
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,920
it pick up maybe a couple hundred yards 
later.

181
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:36,220
And that's say like a cloud.
It's really exactly the same as the 

182
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,761
cloud.
If you look at any picture of a cloudy 

183
00:08:39,761 --> 00:08:42,191
day and then just remove all the clouds,
but they're still there as an invisible 

184
00:08:42,191 --> 00:08:44,780
clouds.
Then when the plane comes along,

185
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:49,810
it's almost like the plane is this magic
pen revealing these invisible clouds 

186
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:54,460
because all the cloud is a region of the
sky where the humidity is above a 

187
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,410
certain level.
So you know,

188
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:55,930
the,
the

189
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,160
humidity's pretty patchy across the sky 
cause like there's a cloud here and 

190
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:01,260
right next to it there's no cloud.
So where the cloud is,

191
00:09:01,261 --> 00:09:03,390
it's high humidity where the cloud 
isn't,

192
00:09:03,391 --> 00:09:08,391
is Loki meditate.
But if both of those were just lowered 

193
00:09:08,391 --> 00:09:10,910
like 10 percent,
then you get no clouds at all than a 

194
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:14,661
plane comes along.
She erases the humidity in the cloud 

195
00:09:14,661 --> 00:09:15,090
area,
ended the non-cloud area.

196
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,740
But this area,
because it was a bit higher,

197
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,140
uh,
you get a trail forming in this area,

198
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:24,141
getting a trail forming.
So it's exactly the same as invisible 

199
00:09:24,141 --> 00:09:24,141
clouds.

200
00:09:24,141 --> 00:09:28,280
Yeah.
And for people that are watching it and 

201
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,221
you're looking up,
you think they're spraying something if 

202
00:09:31,221 --> 00:09:34,281
you're conspiracy minded.
And because of a lot of the videos that 

203
00:09:34,281 --> 00:09:37,851
are out there in particular to that were
recommended to me are what in the hell 

204
00:09:37,851 --> 00:09:38,640
have they sprang?
Right.

205
00:09:38,641 --> 00:09:43,641
So I got to meet with that guy that made
those documentaries and a right away I 

206
00:09:43,641 --> 00:09:47,931
knew something was wrong.
Like he's either on adderall or 

207
00:09:47,931 --> 00:09:48,660
something.
He's just like real,

208
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:53,640
real edgy and speed it up.
And just an odd guy,

209
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,880
which is like a lot of people that are 
conspiracy really conspiratorially 

210
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,210
minded.
They seem to be like very.

211
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,890
They're nervous and agitated.
And,

212
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:08,270
and when we went over like why he thinks
one of the things that he was talking 

213
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:11,481
about was the soil samples and water 
samples and that they've detected all 

214
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:17,550
this aluminum and barium in water and 
particularly aluminum.

215
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,370
And he's showing me all these results 
that he had.

216
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:22,470
But even on the very results that he 
showed me,

217
00:10:22,471 --> 00:10:25,710
it said sludge.
Like he had sent them out for testing.

218
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:26,400
And I said,
well,

219
00:10:26,401 --> 00:10:28,140
what did you send in his?
He goes,

220
00:10:28,141 --> 00:10:30,750
well,
I sent some water from these ponds.

221
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,630
And I said,
but it says sludge on your testing.

222
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,670
And he said,
nobody was water.

223
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:36,030
I go,
okay,

224
00:10:36,031 --> 00:10:38,490
but the lab said it sludge.
I go,

225
00:10:38,491 --> 00:10:39,690
what is sludge?
She goes,

226
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,580
well,
I don't know what sludge is exactly.

227
00:10:41,581 --> 00:10:41,910
I go,
well,

228
00:10:41,911 --> 00:10:46,911
let's look.
Sludge is a combination of water and 

229
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:46,911
dirt.
Okay,

230
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:50,481
so you sent water and dirt.
So do you know that aluminum is one of 

231
00:10:50,481 --> 00:10:54,501
the most common metals on earth.
And you could basically scoop up a patch

232
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:57,660
of dirt pretty much anywhere and find a 
bunch of aluminum in it.

233
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,390
It's really,
really common in trace amounts.

234
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:05,960
I go,
so what you did is you tested dirt and 

235
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,370
it tested positive for being dirt 
musically.

236
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,890
That's exactly what it is.
And the guy was kind of freaking out.

237
00:11:10,891 --> 00:11:11,610
I'm like,
how did you,

238
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,490
how did you not put this together 
yourself?

239
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:18,510
Like if you're the guy who's making this
video and you're trying to find a reason

240
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,630
why,
you could know some facts that you could

241
00:11:21,631 --> 00:11:22,630
throw at people,
we could say,

242
00:11:22,631 --> 00:11:27,631
hey look,
the government is definitely spraying 

243
00:11:27,631 --> 00:11:27,631
things in the sky.
They're spraying them aluminum.

244
00:11:27,631 --> 00:11:30,950
Look,
we found the aluminum and we founded in 

245
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:30,950
the water.
It's in your water supply.

246
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:31,830
It's going to get in your body,
it's going to poison you.

247
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:32,880
Look,
we found in the water,

248
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:38,530
how did it,
how the fuck did he not look at it 

249
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,611
himself is what I was thinking and meet 
when me and him were having this 

250
00:11:40,611 --> 00:11:43,701
conversation,
I realized like you have these people 

251
00:11:43,701 --> 00:11:46,821
that go down,
they're not open minded in regards to 

252
00:11:46,821 --> 00:11:49,590
these subjects.
They go down a very narrow road and that

253
00:11:49,591 --> 00:11:53,130
road is,
the government is doing something to me.

254
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,190
I need to find

255
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,280
out what it is.
Yeah.

256
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,430
And they're really motivated to actually
find evidence.

257
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,550
Yes.
So that trying to find something and you

258
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:05,570
know,
actually trying to find an alternative 

259
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:05,570
explanation isn't really that attracted 
to them.

260
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:08,350
So they find aluminum in the water or in
the soil or whatever.

261
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:13,590
And then they glom onto that as being 
evidence of geoengineering and that's 

262
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:18,241
great for them because they can just 
find loads and loads of samples of soil 

263
00:12:18,241 --> 00:12:18,241
and that's something that gets repeated 
online.

264
00:12:18,241 --> 00:12:23,190
That very fact over and over again,
the aluminum that they found in the 

265
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,280
water,
it's one of the core tenants is like one

266
00:12:24,281 --> 00:12:26,210
of the pillars of the chem trail thing.
There's a,

267
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:31,230
there's a,
there's like four or five different 

268
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:31,230
things,
like in every conspiracy theory,

269
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,860
there are these core beliefs that,
uh,

270
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,360
the 99 percent of the people who believe
in the theory,

271
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,250
one core belief is that you work for the
government.

272
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:42,400
Yeah.
That is a core belief.

273
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,520
Make,
is a retired video game creator.

274
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:48,040
You could find that out.
Made Video Games,

275
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:48,940
right?
Tony Hawk.

276
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:52,120
Yeah.
Made a shit ton of money and decided to,

277
00:12:52,121 --> 00:12:55,360
uh,
to debunk dorks.

278
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:56,010
Yeah,
I didn't.

279
00:12:56,011 --> 00:13:00,070
It didn't start out and I wouldn't refer
to them as Dorks,

280
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,690
but I'm saying they're dorks.
Yeah.

281
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:08,020
Dorks,
if they don't believe this is the 

282
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:08,020
problem.
You're not a Dork.

283
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,400
If you fall for something,
you're a Dork.

284
00:13:09,401 --> 00:13:12,850
If you fall for something,
you don't believe the science that shows

285
00:13:12,851 --> 00:13:14,800
that it's impossible,
but it's not real.

286
00:13:14,801 --> 00:13:17,080
But if you were spraying aluminum in the
sky,

287
00:13:17,081 --> 00:13:18,850
folks,
it would look like aluminum.

288
00:13:18,851 --> 00:13:20,740
You dummy,
it wouldn't look like a cloud.

289
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,920
It wouldn't dissipate.
It would look like a thin missed 

290
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:25,920
essentially.
Yeah,

291
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,720
and metal is not.
It's heavier than fucking air and vapor.

292
00:13:28,721 --> 00:13:30,430
It's not.
It's not going to just sit up there like

293
00:13:30,431 --> 00:13:30,760
that.

294
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,970
It would.
It would be a very different experience.

295
00:13:32,971 --> 00:13:37,971
It has slowly settled to the ground and 
wouldn't look like a cloud and there's 

296
00:13:37,971 --> 00:13:39,070
no reason to do it.
There's no benefit whatsoever.

297
00:13:39,071 --> 00:13:44,071
There's no scientific evidence ever 
uncovered ever that there's any benefit 

298
00:13:44,071 --> 00:13:46,750
for anybody of sprang aluminum over 
people.

299
00:13:46,751 --> 00:13:47,850
It's just,
it's just,

300
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,740
it's a waste of aluma thing.
Even with the,

301
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:54,730
the whole geoengineering field,
there's really no solid evidence that it

302
00:13:54,731 --> 00:13:57,550
will work and we don't know what the 
side effects will be.

303
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:02,610
We don't know how much we're going to.
We would need to spray and we don't 

304
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:02,610
know,
like,

305
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:02,610
uh,
you know,

306
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:03,500
if,
if you know,

307
00:14:03,501 --> 00:14:07,000
when we stopped doing it will bounce 
back in a terrible way and it'd be a big

308
00:14:07,001 --> 00:14:07,720
disaster.
Well,

309
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:12,721
that's an interesting thing because one 
of the reasons why I'm contrary hills 

310
00:14:12,721 --> 00:14:17,250
are interesting to study is because they
actually do have an effect on the 

311
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:21,301
temperature of the earth and this is 
something that we found out after nine 

312
00:14:21,301 --> 00:14:23,320
slash 11 when September 11th happened in
2001,

313
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:23,950
it was the,
the,

314
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:28,990
the big disaster.
There was a shutdown on all flights in 

315
00:14:29,471 --> 00:14:31,240
the United States.
And when they did that,

316
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,790
the temperature changed.
Yeah,

317
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:40,020
because is clouds literally do provide 
like a cover and it is,

318
00:14:41,101 --> 00:14:46,101
it does,
do they act as an insulator or an 

319
00:14:46,101 --> 00:14:46,101
escalator?
Uh,

320
00:14:46,101 --> 00:14:50,641
they essentially act as an insulator.
They block a radiation incoming 

321
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:51,500
radiation during the day

322
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:54,380
and they block outgoing radiation at 
night.

323
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:59,860
But the net effect is that they actually
block more outgoing radiation than they 

324
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,941
do incoming radiation.
So if planes didn't fly at night than 

325
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:07,230
you would,
you would cool the earth down a,

326
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,000
you'd have to stop flying quite a bit 
before nighttime.

327
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,370
So if all the flights in the world were 
between like a 5:00

328
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,170
AM and 5:00
PM local time,

329
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,680
then you could actually call the world 
down by just not having any flights at 

330
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,891
night because if the night flights that 
have this really big kind of blanketing 

331
00:15:23,891 --> 00:15:24,170
effect that stopped being outgoing,
radiation.

332
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,350
So the night of flights actually heat 
the world up.

333
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,610
Yes they do.
They act like a,

334
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,400
like a blanket,
uh,

335
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:34,850
you know how it's,
it's warmer on a well in a cloudy day.

336
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,260
Like he doesn't get as cold at night,
you know,

337
00:15:36,261 --> 00:15:38,530
does it get really cold at night because
there's nothing over them.

338
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,010
They tend to have any,
any cover one.

339
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,530
It's one of the reasons,
but yeah,

340
00:15:42,531 --> 00:15:47,531
they,
the controls will actually a warm the 

341
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:52,091
planet because the,
the amount of outgoing radiation they 

342
00:15:52,091 --> 00:15:56,661
block is just way high.
I just go with the wave lengths and the 

343
00:15:56,661 --> 00:15:56,661
size of the particles.
That one.

344
00:15:56,661 --> 00:15:58,780
So that,
that's something to be concerned about,

345
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:01,780
that that's something that people are 
legitimately monitoring.

346
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:07,140
Um,
when people need to understand is just 

347
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,941
because you feel like when you look up 
in the sky and see this crisscross 

348
00:16:08,941 --> 00:16:09,340
patterns that they're spraying,
you know,

349
00:16:09,341 --> 00:16:14,341
one's spraying.
This is just a natural reaction to jet 

350
00:16:14,771 --> 00:16:18,820
engines and condensation in the 
atmosphere and the heat and the moisture

351
00:16:18,821 --> 00:16:19,450
of the jet engine.

352
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,570
That's all it is.
There it,

353
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:25,620
they are actually talking about a way of
using controls for a kind of Geo 

354
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:29,061
engineering and this is something that 
people often get confused about because 

355
00:16:29,061 --> 00:16:30,520
you see these two words together,
controls and engineering and they think,

356
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,360
oh,
that's chem trails,

357
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:36,750
but what they're trying to do is use air
traffic control and computers and 

358
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:40,951
weather forecasting to make it so the 
planes don't fly through the contrail 

359
00:16:40,951 --> 00:16:43,690
forming areas when they would make 
controls at night.

360
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,120
I'm making.
So they do fly route contrary or forming

361
00:16:46,121 --> 00:16:49,300
areas what it might make some trials 
during the day.

362
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:52,360
So this is a conversation they're having
or something that's actually being.

363
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:57,420
It's not something that they've actually
done something that they can research 

364
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:02,011
fairly easily.
So if they were considering trying to 

365
00:17:02,011 --> 00:17:04,450
heat up the atmosphere or heat up the 
earth at night,

366
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,630
they would just fly over these moisture 
rich areas and if they weren't,

367
00:17:07,631 --> 00:17:08,380
they would avoid them.

368
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:13,600
Yeah.
The goal obviously is to combat climate 

369
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,501
change,
global warming and cooling down so that 

370
00:17:16,501 --> 00:17:20,820
a relatively cheap way of doing that to 
a degree is to have these planes be 

371
00:17:21,881 --> 00:17:25,960
controlled by computers and it could 
increase his fuel costs,

372
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:30,961
but the airline by about two or three 
percent because they had to make very 

373
00:17:30,961 --> 00:17:33,220
deviations sometimes in height and 
sometimes indirection,

374
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:38,790
but it could actually have a significant
effect on the earth climate if we had 

375
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:41,320
the entire world,
airline fleets all in this program where

376
00:17:41,321 --> 00:17:46,321
they would fly,
making controls where they were needed 

377
00:17:46,321 --> 00:17:46,321
and not making contracts where they were
not needed

378
00:17:46,321 --> 00:17:48,480
and how exactly they're monitoring the 
moisture content of the atmosphere.

379
00:17:48,481 --> 00:17:50,370
Like what are they to do that 
satellites.

380
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,990
Yeah,
it's a combination of things.

381
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:53,170
Uh,
the,

382
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:58,460
the youth sounding balloons,
which are these red weather balloons 

383
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:01,641
basically,
which got mistaken for Ufo is quite a 

384
00:18:01,641 --> 00:18:03,861
lot.
And they use satellites and they use a 

385
00:18:03,861 --> 00:18:06,640
planes a sensing the environment when 
they're flying through it and they use 

386
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,650
all these inputs and it goes into a big 
computer model,

387
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,530
which basically predicts where the,
uh,

388
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,630
what the,
uh,

389
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,840
humidity will be at any particular point
is basically a big weather forecast.

390
00:18:15,841 --> 00:18:16,680
But the upper atmosphere

391
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:21,820
now jamie,
Google Cei a admits Geo engineering 

392
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:27,890
because this is one that the cabot trail
believers constantly bring up.

393
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:33,760
It was a conversation that I'm some guy 
in the CIA had at some meeting where 

394
00:18:35,421 --> 00:18:39,260
they were discussing potential future 
ways,

395
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,360
uh,
to use geo engineering.

396
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,650
Like,
let's play with this.

397
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,290
Guys has CIA director,
John Brennan,

398
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:51,420
go ahead,
often referred to collectively as Geo 

399
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,061
engineering that potentially could help 
reverse the warming effects of global 

400
00:18:54,061 --> 00:18:58,111
climate change.
One that has gained my personal 

401
00:18:58,111 --> 00:19:00,150
attention is stratospheric aerosol 
injection or Sai,

402
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:04,480
a method of seeding the stratosphere 
with particles that can help reflect the

403
00:19:04,481 --> 00:19:09,481
sun's heat.
And much the same way that volcanic 

404
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,270
eruptions do in Sai program could limit 
global temperature increases,

405
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:17,760
reducing some risks associated with 
higher temperatures and providing the 

406
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:17,760
wires that are freaking out.

407
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:23,460
Keep changing back to to youtube glitch.
I have to refresh the page and I didn't 

408
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,450
want to restart.
This guy had epilepsy?

409
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,640
Yeah,
spheric.

410
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:29,600
Eris.
Hold on.

411
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,610
Go ahead and just take it from where he 
left it here.

412
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:32,270
What else?
What else?

413
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:32,810
He has to say?

414
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:38,490
Injection or s a I.
A method of seeding the stratosphere 

415
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:42,931
with particles that can help reflect the
sun's heat in much the same way that 

416
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:46,651
volcanic eruptions do.
An Sai program could limit global 

417
00:19:46,651 --> 00:19:51,361
temperature increases,
reducing some risks associated with 

418
00:19:51,361 --> 00:19:54,631
higher temperatures and providing the 
world economy additional time to 

419
00:19:54,631 --> 00:19:58,441
transition from fossil fuels.
This process is also relatively 

420
00:19:58,441 --> 00:20:02,521
inexpensive.
The National Research Research Council 

421
00:20:02,521 --> 00:20:05,491
estimates that are fully deployed.
Sai Program would cost about 

422
00:20:05,491 --> 00:20:08,790
$10,000,000,000
yearly as promising as it may be moving 

423
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:12,130
forward on sai would also raise a number
of challenges for our government and for

424
00:20:12,131 --> 00:20:15,040
the international community.
On the technical side,

425
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:20,130
greenhouse gas emission reductions would
still have to accompany sai to address 

426
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:23,290
other climate change effects such as 
ocean acidification,

427
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:28,620
because sai alone would not remove 
greenhouse gases from the atmosphere on 

428
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:33,661
the geopolitical side,
their technologies potential to alter 

429
00:20:33,661 --> 00:20:37,291
weather patterns and benefit certain 
regions of the world at the expense of 

430
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:41,760
other regions could trigger sharp 
opposition by some nations others might 

431
00:20:42,401 --> 00:20:46,870
seize on SSI benefits and back away from
their commitment to carbon dioxide.

432
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,440
And as with other breakthrough 
technologies,

433
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:55,620
global norms and standards are lacking 
to guide the deployment and 

434
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,380
implementation of Sai and otherwise.
Cool.

435
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:01,520
We get it.
So this guy is talking about an idea of 

436
00:21:02,671 --> 00:21:07,170
spraying things in the atmosphere to do 
something.

437
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:12,310
Yeah.
He's talking about geoengineering 

438
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:12,310
spraying stuff from playing was talking 
about.

439
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,710
He's talking about reflective particles,
right?

440
00:21:13,711 --> 00:21:15,150
Isn't it?
Yeah.

441
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:20,240
The spray sulfur dioxide,
which isn't exactly a reflective 

442
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,871
protocol,
but it acts as a nucleus for a 

443
00:21:23,871 --> 00:21:23,970
parameter.
Speyer clouds and things like that.

444
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,650
It's basically,
like you said,

445
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:28,610
the same thing.
A volcano does what a volcano erupt.

446
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:33,700
It spews a whole bunch of sulfur dioxide
and various other things into the upper 

447
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,270
atmosphere and that creates hayes 
basically,

448
00:21:36,271 --> 00:21:41,271
which,
which blocks the incoming radiation and 

449
00:21:41,271 --> 00:21:42,780
cools things down.
Every time a big volcano goes off,

450
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,600
you see a little dip in the earth's 
temperature because of this,

451
00:21:46,601 --> 00:21:51,601
this blocking effect that and so the 
theory is that you could do something 

452
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,490
similar and you could do it by spreading
things out of planes,

453
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:58,970
but yeah,
he's talking about things that we might 

454
00:21:58,970 --> 00:21:58,970
do in the future.

455
00:21:58,970 --> 00:21:59,970
You see every,
every year he uses the future tense,

456
00:21:59,971 --> 00:22:02,100
like we could do this in mind.
They may do this,

457
00:22:02,101 --> 00:22:07,101
the effects might be this,
and he's talking about the possible 

458
00:22:07,101 --> 00:22:09,450
geopolitical impacts of it,
which are very significant,

459
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:14,480
like if one country is going to be 
spraying something that would cause the 

460
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,830
say the monsoons to double in intensity 
or to have and intensity in India.

461
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:24,740
That could cause the deaths of millions 
of people from famine and flooding and 

462
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:29,691
this is what people think has happened 
with the big hurricanes in the United 

463
00:22:29,691 --> 00:22:33,440
States.
They do think that there's no evidence 

464
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,571
of that actually happening.
At the pattern of hurricanes is pretty 

465
00:22:35,571 --> 00:22:36,870
much the same as it's been for a long 
time.

466
00:22:36,871 --> 00:22:39,000
When you look at the statistical 
variations,

467
00:22:39,001 --> 00:22:39,650
there's,
you know,

468
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:44,660
maybe a bit more intense because the 
oceans are a bit warmer where it's not 

469
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,100
a,
you know,

470
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:50,690
people think that hurricanes have been 
steered a harp.

471
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:51,990
Yeah,
through harp,

472
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,970
but that doesn't make any sense,
but there is,

473
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,390
there are ways that do make sense which 
are a cloud seeding.

474
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:02,810
Like if you do lots of seeding of the 
hurricane on one side you could perhaps 

475
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:07,790
reduce the amount of humidity and 
moisture on that side and so it will 

476
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:10,500
kind of turn a little bit more and move 
over to one side.

477
00:23:10,501 --> 00:23:15,501
So there are ways that you might work.
And they did actually experiment with 

478
00:23:15,501 --> 00:23:17,310
this.
I think back in the seventies or so,

479
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,610
there was one experiment where they 
tried seeding a hurricane,

480
00:23:20,611 --> 00:23:25,611
but he ended up going somewhere else 
other than where the were they intended 

481
00:23:25,611 --> 00:23:27,840
and it destroyed a whole bunch of 
houses.

482
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:33,200
The problem with having a video like 
this is that this guy is admitting that 

483
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:37,140
they have looked into potentially spring
things.

484
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:40,020
No one has ever denied that.
We've been,

485
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,780
we've been looking into geo engineering 
for decades.

486
00:23:42,781 --> 00:23:45,410
It's been proposed like in,
in,

487
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,100
in some sense

488
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,220
we're over 100 years,
the other since the seventies.

489
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:53,480
The other problem is he cave that.
He gave it a initials as a Pi.

490
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,760
That's a problem.
People love initials.

491
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,490
They love it.
That's super exciting.

492
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,740
Not even really well.
Most people use the srm,

493
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:01,810
which is,
uh,

494
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,210
the solar radiation management.
Ah,

495
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,610
that's a good one too.
Yeah,

496
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:11,200
I saw as a CIA dea.
It's okay.

497
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,340
Sounds good.
That sounds.

498
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:16,550
Sounds more scary than Dziedzic aerosol 
injection.

499
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:22,080
Um,
but they would have to be studies and 

500
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,350
has to be.
There are,

501
00:24:22,351 --> 00:24:23,990
there are lots of studies going on right
now.

502
00:24:23,991 --> 00:24:26,010
There are people are studying 
geoengineering.

503
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:29,300
There's actually lots of people who 
specialize in Geo engineering.

504
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,120
While I was going to say is studies 
would have to be available for people to

505
00:24:32,121 --> 00:24:34,520
understand,
but nobody wants to do that.

506
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:38,180
Nobody wants to go in and you wanted to 
look up and see the thing behind the jet

507
00:24:38,181 --> 00:24:38,420
and go.

508
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,420
They started it.
They're spraying this patchwork.

509
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:42,350
Look,
this haze all over us.

510
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:47,380
Which does happen,
you can have a clear sky and you have 

511
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:50,501
the right conditions in a bunch of jets 
fly over and all the sudden it's very 

512
00:24:50,501 --> 00:24:50,501
hazy.
It does,

513
00:24:50,501 --> 00:24:53,950
it does.
And that's the type of thing that's 

514
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:53,950
being reported since the Second World 
War or even even earlier,

515
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,760
either first contract that we're 
spreading out into clouds.

516
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:57,740
We reported in like the 19 twenties.
Yeah,

517
00:24:57,741 --> 00:25:01,100
well I took some of these photos and I 
put them up.

518
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:06,310
I think the last time we had this 
conversation where you could see them 

519
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:09,281
from World War II,
you can see these jets and they see the 

520
00:25:09,281 --> 00:25:10,880
contract falls behind the jets and the.
But some people.

521
00:25:10,881 --> 00:25:13,250
That's the other thing is con trails,
uh,

522
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:15,620
dissipate.
But chem trail stay.

523
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,220
Well that's not.
You misunderstand what happens.

524
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,430
The contrail stay.
If there's more moisture,

525
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,980
the,
if the conditions are correct,

526
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:25,640
they stay.

527
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:30,640
And if the conditions are barely enough 
to make a contrary to dissipate fairly 

528
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,180
rapidly with that thing,
they kind of use circular logic.

529
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,240
And if I ask them,
why do you think that controls a 

530
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,060
dissipate in Kentrell stay and say,
because I can see it,

531
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:43,330
if you look up,
you look at the chem trails and the 

532
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:45,341
staging and the country also dissipating
because of how do you know which is 

533
00:25:45,341 --> 00:25:45,341
which?
Well,

534
00:25:45,341 --> 00:25:45,890
the country also the ones that 
dissipate.

535
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:51,200
Yeah.
So they don't have any basis for that 

536
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:51,200
belief.
And you know,

537
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,030
the one thing I do,
which you've probably seen is that video

538
00:25:53,031 --> 00:25:57,650
where I go through all my old books on,
on the weather and I look up in each one

539
00:25:57,651 --> 00:26:02,651
of them,
the section on contract and I read the 

540
00:26:02,651 --> 00:26:04,580
bit in a contrail processed per hour,
sometimes control,

541
00:26:04,581 --> 00:26:08,480
sometimes spread out to cover the sky 
contrary last a long time.

542
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:13,810
And I go back from these books from the 
1998 all the way back to the 19 fifties.

543
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:19,810
And I've got books in the 19 forties.
And if you show people the actual books 

544
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:24,670
is a really powerful way of getting 
through to them because they just 

545
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,030
assumed that controls campuses.
Right?

546
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:31,330
And they've assumed that this is a 
recent phenomenon because they don't 

547
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:34,271
remember it clearly weren't paying 
attention what the people don't notice 

548
00:26:34,271 --> 00:26:38,500
them until you're 90 percent of the 
people don't notice Cantrell's until 

549
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,220
they hear about the chem trail.
Conspiracy theory.

550
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,530
A lot of people,
they will hear about it.

551
00:26:42,531 --> 00:26:44,070
And then the day they will go

552
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,980
outside and look at the sky.
And then that's the first time that ever

553
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:51,981
notice these controls.
Even the people that are like the high 

554
00:26:51,981 --> 00:26:51,981
ups in the,
uh,

555
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,530
in the,
in the country movement,

556
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:59,490
they only notice them when they hear 
about the theory.

557
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,030
There's a guy,
um,

558
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:04,040
I can't remember his name now,
but he lived in San Diego and he,

559
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:07,920
he never noticed them until like 2014.
And he lived there all his life.

560
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,990
And now he's publishing scientific 
papers.

561
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,360
Uh,
Jay Marvin Herndon is his name.

562
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:17,510
He's publishing these scientific papers 
about how the sprain slash like the 

563
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,530
waste products of burning coal and power
stations.

564
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:24,560
The spray that in the upper atmosphere.
He's actually got like three or four 

565
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,970
papers published in these kind of pay to
publish a scientific journals.

566
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,540
And that's kind of becoming a bit of a 
problem.

567
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:32,940
I like this,
this thing with Brennan,

568
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:35,730
the CIA guy.
People bring that up all the time,

569
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,810
all the time,
all the time.

570
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:39,360
And you just have to explain it to them.
Again,

571
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:41,490
I don't know what he's talking about.
The future use.

572
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:43,150
And then this guy

573
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:48,550
talking about possible solutions for.
For global warming.

574
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:53,570
Yeah.
Now the problem with it is when he's 

575
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:56,611
talking about possible solutions and 
then people look up and they see these 

576
00:27:56,611 --> 00:28:00,511
actual clouds that are created by jets.
They assumed this has already begun at 

577
00:28:00,511 --> 00:28:05,220
the government would not tell us about 
it because they don't understand the 

578
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,630
difference between contrary and with 
this stuff would look like.

579
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,500
Yeah.
Yeah.

580
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:11,200
And just the fact that contract look 
like this,

581
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:16,630
they,
they heard the contrail shouldn't 

582
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:19,051
persist.
Well what's another thing that drove me 

583
00:28:19,051 --> 00:28:19,051
crazy?
He's like,

584
00:28:19,051 --> 00:28:22,080
if you really want to worry about health
consequences of these things that you 

585
00:28:22,571 --> 00:28:25,810
see in the sky,
there's a reality to it.

586
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,840
The reality is they're burning jet fuel 
and all the people that live around the 

587
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,350
airports get sick.
Like it's.

588
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:37,380
There's,
there's high levels of respiratory 

589
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,871
illness that are associated with living 
within a certain distance of airplanes 

590
00:28:39,871 --> 00:28:42,790
or airports.
If you're in a congested hub like lax,

591
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:46,900
don't buy a house like a block away.
It's not good for your health.

592
00:28:46,901 --> 00:28:51,901
They're burning jet fuel that's going to
get in the air pollution pollution from 

593
00:28:51,901 --> 00:28:52,270
cars.
Yeah,

594
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:57,600
it's even more intense because you're 
having thousands and thousands of giant 

595
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:57,600
planes.

596
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,360
[inaudible] even less smoke Santa 
Monica,

597
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:04,390
they have problems with that.
If you look at the houses just at the 

598
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:07,750
end of Santa Monica runway,
which is right next to the end of the 

599
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:10,940
runway disease houses that did tests 
with various metal particulars and stuff

600
00:29:10,941 --> 00:29:12,650
and the ones right by the end of the 
runway,

601
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,330
you know,
they get to get pollution.

602
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,200
Of course.
It's very real problems.

603
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,660
That's the real problem.
Yeah,

604
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:22,730
and that's a real one.
Now imagine if that was something that 

605
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:25,371
the government was engineering,
that they really were engineering 

606
00:29:25,371 --> 00:29:28,431
spraying things to give people 
respiratory illness so that the hospital

607
00:29:28,651 --> 00:29:32,130
industry could profit and whatever the 
reason was.

608
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,630
Right.
That would be,

609
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,460
you know,
something that people could be concerned

610
00:29:35,461 --> 00:29:35,790
with.
Like,

611
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:40,791
look,
there's a real connection between 

612
00:29:40,791 --> 00:29:41,770
airplanes and illnesses,
but it's not spraying in the Scott,

613
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:46,860
that's not real.
I understand people love these things 

614
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,860
and I understand people don't trust the 
government.

615
00:29:47,861 --> 00:29:49,420
Those things completely make sense to 
me,

616
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:53,020
but you got to pay attention to what's 
real and what's not real,

617
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:58,050
because as soon as you don't do that,
then all the real stuff that the 

618
00:29:58,050 --> 00:29:58,050
government does,
all the real stuff.

619
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:02,971
The government does like these fucking 
roads they're going to build in Alaska 

620
00:30:02,971 --> 00:30:07,441
right now through dangerous areas where,
where they have a salmon rivers where 

621
00:30:07,441 --> 00:30:08,890
they're gonna they're gonna start doing 
mining.

622
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:10,420
I think.
What is the Pebble Beach?

623
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:11,660
Is that the.
No,

624
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,120
what is the,
uh,

625
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:18,390
the,
the big mining issue in Alaska that is 

626
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:19,360
going on right now.

627
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,450
Bristol Bay.
Bristol Bay.

628
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,460
That's it.
Why don't I

629
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:28,730
pebble in Bristol?
I don't know how I got those two 

630
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:28,730
confused pebble mine.
And that's what it is.

631
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:33,500
And they want,
they want to do this and it's near a 

632
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:37,161
major salmon area or these salmon river 
and they're people that live.

633
00:30:37,201 --> 00:30:39,330
They're terrified that they're going to 
do this.

634
00:30:39,331 --> 00:30:44,331
This is a real for profit thing where 
they're putting the environment at risk 

635
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:51,140
that's real,
so this is something that people should 

636
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:51,140
be concerned about,
but they're not.

637
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,110
They don't get concerned about those 
kinds of things.

638
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:54,490
You know,
environmentalists do and you know,

639
00:30:54,491 --> 00:30:57,720
big conservationist do,
but the conspiracy theorists don't.

640
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,310
They don't look at that and go,
hey,

641
00:30:59,311 --> 00:31:04,311
here's clear evidence of the government 
being in bed with enormous businesses 

642
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:10,070
that stand a profit,
spectacular amounts of money from 

643
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:12,960
risking the environment and risking 
these very delicate salmon fisheries.

644
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:18,120
Yeah.
That type of thing is the exact reason 

645
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,650
why I still spend so much time debunking
stuff like conspiracy theories because I

646
00:31:20,651 --> 00:31:24,550
think that so much a of conspiracy 
theories,

647
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:27,940
the results of the effect of conspiracy 
theories is distracting people from real

648
00:31:27,941 --> 00:31:28,940
issues.
Some real issue.

649
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,190
Yes.
I agree.

650
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,300
Like if you,
like you say,

651
00:31:31,301 --> 00:31:32,800
with the,
the airplane stuff,

652
00:31:32,801 --> 00:31:35,590
like if people are thinking that 
spraying chemicals out of the bed to the

653
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:40,650
back of the airplanes,
they're just not gonna be worried about 

654
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:43,110
a regular pollution and if they think 
that the controlling the climate 

655
00:31:43,781 --> 00:31:48,781
already,
they're not going to worry about any 

656
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:48,781
type of global warming.

657
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:52,880
So let's find a one that we disagree on.
I think you believe the official story 

658
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,560
of the JFK assassination.
Do you more or less.

659
00:31:55,561 --> 00:31:56,460
Yeah,
more or less.

660
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:01,170
My belief in this is this changes over 
time.

661
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:03,870
I think that Lee Harvey Oswald was in on
it.

662
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:09,320
I think he was a part of it,
but I think there were multiple people 

663
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:09,320
that were in on it.
That's what I believe.

664
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,040
Do you think the multiple shooters?
Yes.

665
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:16,130
And one of the reasons why I believe 
that is because of the formation of the 

666
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:19,071
single bullet theory in the single 
bullet theory was formed because the 

667
00:32:19,071 --> 00:32:22,590
fact that they had to account for one 
bullet that hit the underpass ricocheted

668
00:32:22,591 --> 00:32:25,260
off and put some man in the hospital.
Um,

669
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:30,560
and that before that they did not have 
an explanation for why all of these 

670
00:32:31,321 --> 00:32:36,321
bullets bullet holes,
all these wounds were in all these 

671
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:36,321
different people's bodies.

672
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:40,700
The other reason why I'm inclined to 
believe there's a conspiracy was the 

673
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,870
fact that they found that bullet on 
Connolly's Gurney when they brought him 

674
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:44,630
into the hospital.
It's too convenient.

675
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:47,000
And the bullet itself is fairly 
pristine.

676
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:52,270
Now,
knowing as much as I know about bullets 

677
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,710
from personal experience of hunting,
you can hit anything with the boy.

678
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,640
I pulled a lot of bullets out of 
animals.

679
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,680
When you shoot an animal and you hit 
bone,

680
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:01,610
those bullets,
they distort brutally.

681
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,310
I mean,
they don't look like that.

682
00:33:03,311 --> 00:33:05,990
And if they go through to people and hit
all sorts of bone,

683
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:10,370
that's the bullet that came out of 
Connolly's body or connolly's Gurney,

684
00:33:10,371 --> 00:33:15,371
excuse me.
And that's the bullet that they are 

685
00:33:15,371 --> 00:33:15,371
attributing to this,
a single bullet theory.

686
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:20,580
Uh,
if you look at the path of the bullet 

687
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:23,380
that goes through connolly or goes 
through Kennedy and then goes through 

688
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:23,530
connelly,
that to me is,

689
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:26,600
is not unbelievable.
It's not unbelievable.

690
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,790
That one is,
hey,

691
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,810
you've got to look at the other one,

692
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,040
but even that one,
but no,

693
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:31,040
no.
See what I'm saying.

694
00:33:31,041 --> 00:33:36,041
Even that one is not unbelievable.
It is believable to me because I know 

695
00:33:36,041 --> 00:33:37,880
that bullets do strange things when they
hit things

696
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:42,920
right.
But you've got to combine that with the 

697
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:42,920
fact that the bullet came out fairly 
pristine,

698
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,641
which meant it didn't actually go 
through a kind of a bouncy path like 

699
00:33:46,641 --> 00:33:46,641
that.
It went through a straight path.

700
00:33:46,641 --> 00:33:49,380
This diagram is from a conspiracy 
theorist,

701
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,490
but essentially,
yes.

702
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,120
But the thing of the diagrams that will 
show the actual path with him,

703
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:54,390
like,
you know,

704
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:58,170
they've got them the butts that are on 
the same level and you know that Kennedy

705
00:33:58,171 --> 00:33:59,640
was actually sitting here was ella 
bullied?

706
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:00,180
Yes.

707
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,220
So,
um,

708
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:06,230
see if we can find one that has the 
actual seating arrangement or more 

709
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,220
accurate seating.
They will.

710
00:34:07,221 --> 00:34:09,690
They will one right there with the red 
line and the right hand side.

711
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,360
The one the right hand side.
That's a more accurate.

712
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,820
I'm from above.
From above,

713
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:15,790
yeah.
There's,

714
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:19,860
there's also the fact that there was 
particles,

715
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:22,950
there was more metallic particles from 
the bullets,

716
00:34:22,951 --> 00:34:25,740
more fragments from the bullet in 
Conley's body.

717
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:30,450
Then we're missing from the bullet.
I do not believe that was the bullet and

718
00:34:30,451 --> 00:34:32,820
I think that that is a very reasonable 
assumption.

719
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:33,680
Well,
you know what you should do.

720
00:34:33,681 --> 00:34:36,920
You should get one of those guns.
Get the same bullets.

721
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,120
Okay.
Some ballistic dummies,

722
00:34:38,121 --> 00:34:39,620
which some bones inside and start 
shooting.

723
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,840
They've already done that.
Yeah.

724
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:42,460
The Penn and teller did that.
Yeah.

725
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:47,570
Some people have done it and they have 
found pretty close to what actually 

726
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:47,570
happened.
No,

727
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:48,260
they did within within the ground.

728
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,100
No,
no,

729
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:54,150
no.
Every bullet that hit bone got 

730
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:54,150
distorted.
That's just what happens.

731
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:57,970
The you shoot those bullets into water 
or you shoot those bullets into like 

732
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:02,321
fluff or something like that.
That doesn't have a lot of impact to 

733
00:35:02,321 --> 00:35:04,040
slow the bullet down or then you get a 
bullet that looks like that.

734
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:07,700
If you shoot a bullet into bone,
they distort wildly where the bone was.

735
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,890
The last thing that it hit,
but it doesn't matter.

736
00:35:09,891 --> 00:35:11,870
It's still hitting bone,
but he stopped at that point.

737
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:12,670
Yeah,
but I mean,

738
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,350
didn't it hit bone and in Kennedy's body
as well?

739
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:17,350
Hm.
Went through his neck.

740
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:24,040
The odds of it hitting only soft tissue 
and it's going to go through his neck 

741
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:27,911
and it came out here that didn't clip 
one of his vertebrae or something like 

742
00:35:27,911 --> 00:35:27,911
that.
I don't think that's real.

743
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:30,650
I think also there's a difference 
between,

744
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,790
and this is fact from David Lifton's 
book best evidence,

745
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:38,560
which was a book by a,
an accountant to win over,

746
00:35:38,561 --> 00:35:43,561
um,
the Warren Commission report and fennel 

747
00:35:43,561 --> 00:35:45,410
is factual inaccuracies and all these 
contradictions.

748
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:50,160
He found that there was a difference in 
the autopsy report at Bethesda,

749
00:35:50,161 --> 00:35:53,850
Maryland,
the to naval hospital versus the,

750
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:58,590
the show what they had reported on the 
scene in Dallas.

751
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:03,950
The first doctors that got ahold of 
Kennedy's body in Dallas before they 

752
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:07,581
flew him to Bethesda,
said that the hole in his neck was an 

753
00:36:07,581 --> 00:36:09,870
entry wound.
When they got to Maryland,

754
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,600
they changed that to a tracheotomy 
whole.

755
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,600
They changed the impact and they said 
that it was a.

756
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,160
They said that this was not an impact 
from a bullet,

757
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:21,510
that it was from something else.

758
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:24,200
Yeah.
Someone said they enlarge the hole.

759
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,940
Insert a trick tube.

760
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,400
Yeah.
Well,

761
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,300
I think.
Well,

762
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:29,770
uh,
there was,

763
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:34,771
uh,
there was also a lot of pressure on 

764
00:36:34,771 --> 00:36:35,950
these people to try to wrap this up nice
and tight and say that Lee Harvey Oswald

765
00:36:35,951 --> 00:36:36,550
was the shooter.

766
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,410
There was.
Yeah.

767
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,250
Yeah,
yeah.

768
00:36:38,251 --> 00:36:43,251
There's this big thing about the CIA,
the CIA inventing the FBI.

769
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:46,260
The FBI will inventing the term 
conspiracy theory.

770
00:36:46,261 --> 00:36:47,930
He was a CIA thing.
I think it was A.

771
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:51,750
Yeah.
And this was a couple of years after the

772
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,100
assassination.
They,

773
00:36:53,101 --> 00:36:54,840
uh,
there was a memo that went out were they

774
00:36:54,841 --> 00:36:57,540
were concerned about all these 
conspiracy theories that were coming out

775
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:00,240
and they used it to them conspiracy 
theories and then they,

776
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,500
they said they should try to,
uh,

777
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:06,330
basically debunk them and make the 
people who,

778
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:11,590
uh,
spread them around look like a 

779
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:15,740
conspiracy theorist.
But basically the theory is that the 

780
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,550
term conspiracy theory came from that 
particular memo,

781
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:21,120
that memo that never actually encouraged
people to use the term.

782
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,170
Uh,
but yeah,

783
00:37:22,171 --> 00:37:27,171
there was a huge concern from the CIA 
that they would be,

784
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:30,210
they would lose the trust of the public 
if people,

785
00:37:30,211 --> 00:37:32,760
everybody started believing that it was 
a conspiracy theory.

786
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:38,330
At least that's what they said.
I mean maybe there is a conspiracy and 

787
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:38,330
maybe they are just trying to cover it 
up.

788
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:38,330
But

789
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:42,780
did you see the most recent dump of 
information on the Kennedy assassination

790
00:37:42,781 --> 00:37:47,781
that Jack Ruby had stated to people that
before the day of the Kennedy 

791
00:37:47,781 --> 00:37:48,930
assassination,
keep an eye out today that's going to be

792
00:37:48,931 --> 00:37:51,150
fireworks.
I didn't say that.

793
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:56,210
Yeah,
those Jack Ruby who eventually wound up 

794
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:56,820
shooting Lee Harvey Oswald in front of 
the police officer.

795
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:58,770
Yeah,
something like that.

796
00:37:58,771 --> 00:38:01,320
You know,
his dad obviously.

797
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:06,321
So you couldn't ask him what he actually
meant and things like that take on a 

798
00:38:06,321 --> 00:38:08,940
special significance after an event.
True.

799
00:38:08,941 --> 00:38:10,510
Whereas it could be just talking about 
it,

800
00:38:10,511 --> 00:38:15,511
like he was going to go visit his ex 
wife or something or it was going to go 

801
00:38:15,511 --> 00:38:17,370
to the bar or he was looking forward to 
shouting at the parade or whatever.

802
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:19,720
Could have been nothing but people say 
things and you know,

803
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:24,860
after something happens people go back 
and they look at everything that 

804
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,771
happened and then they say,
well that sounds like something 

805
00:38:27,771 --> 00:38:27,771
significant.
Like with the Vegas shooting,

806
00:38:27,771 --> 00:38:32,760
uh,
there was a woman walking around the 

807
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,640
crowd in the Vegas shooting saying,
yeah,

808
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:36,220
you're all going to die.
Basically what some people said,

809
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:40,000
and this was like half an hour before 
the actual shooting itself.

810
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,280
So people take that event and then since
a lot of people did die,

811
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:50,910
they think that this woman actually knew
what was going to happen and she was 

812
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:51,130
trying to warn people.
Right.

813
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:54,460
But you also get crazy people wandering 
around saying things all the time,

814
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:55,570
you know,
especially in Vegas.

815
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,740
Yeah.
And the problem with you're all going to

816
00:38:58,741 --> 00:39:01,050
die is that,
that's a common one.

817
00:39:01,051 --> 00:39:06,051
Some guy was yelling that we took 
pictures of them when we're in vegas 

818
00:39:06,051 --> 00:39:09,531
long before the shooting.
It was a few months ago we were 

819
00:39:09,531 --> 00:39:10,910
standing.
No,

820
00:39:10,911 --> 00:39:14,790
we were in a car and he was standing on 
the corner and he had a stack of signs.

821
00:39:14,791 --> 00:39:18,330
I put it up on my instagram.
I know I did because there was many,

822
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:21,840
there was stacks of signs.
He had not just one sign.

823
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:27,010
We had like a long totem pole of signs 
with all these different things and I 

824
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:27,870
was taking photos of it and the guy was 
yelling out,

825
00:39:27,871 --> 00:39:32,871
everyone's going to die.
I mean he was yelling it out that you 

826
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,560
know God's wrath and all this crazy 
religious stuff.

827
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,420
That's a common thing for crazy people 
to shout.

828
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:37,770
Yes.
What they do show.

829
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,920
It's not like this woman was saying 
specifically someone is going to shoot 

830
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,920
everyone at this concert,
get out of here.

831
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:46,530
This is a dangerous area.
If she was trying to warn them,

832
00:39:46,531 --> 00:39:48,090
she would have been a bit more specific.
Yes,

833
00:39:48,091 --> 00:39:49,290
very specific.
Right.

834
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,360
If she knew something,
do you see?

835
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,620
Do you find it?
No,

836
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,170
I know I put it up there because we were
mocking it.

837
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,150
Maybe I'll put it on my instagram story 
and it went away.

838
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,760
I don't think so though.
I think it's,

839
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:02,460
it's there from.
I want to say,

840
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:04,920
I want to say it was at least six months
ago,

841
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:08,760
but we were mocking this guy because 
this guy got a lot of fucking signs,

842
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:11,190
like one signs on enough.
I go is this is the guy,

843
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:13,650
this is the reason why twitter only has 
140 characters.

844
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:15,130
Motherfuckers like this.
I,

845
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:17,840
I remember is like July because there's 
like 120 degrees out too,

846
00:40:17,841 --> 00:40:18,600
wasn't it?
Yes.

847
00:40:18,601 --> 00:40:21,960
It was a very hot.
This goofy ass hole had this giant stack

848
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,610
of science.
Um,

849
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,280
so the,
the back to the Kennedy thing,

850
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:31,310
what do you think happened?
Do you think that Lee Harvey Oswald 

851
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:31,310
probably acted alone?

852
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:34,990
I think he probably acted alone.
I think the physics of what happened 

853
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:37,370
like is fairly consistent with the 
single shooter theory.

854
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:41,900
Now admittedly the magic bullet is a bit
strange,

855
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:46,130
but I don't think it was after the 
rounds of possibilities a

856
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:49,140
do because of the fact the metal 
particles.

857
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,380
There's more bullet fragments in 
Connolly's body.

858
00:40:52,381 --> 00:40:54,900
Then we're missing from that almost 
pristine bullet.

859
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:58,740
And even though the fact that it hit 
connolly at the very end,

860
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:04,350
if it went through all that flesh and it
didn't hit any bone until it hit his 

861
00:41:04,801 --> 00:41:09,801
wrist,
then it would not have been compromised 

862
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:09,801
very much ballistically.
It would still be going incredibly fast.

863
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:11,460
It still would have smashed into that 
bone.

864
00:41:11,461 --> 00:41:14,730
It did enough to break his wrist and it 
would have distorted the bullet.

865
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,080
That's just what happens with bullets.

866
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,000
See,
unfortunately,

867
00:41:17,001 --> 00:41:20,180
I didn't really follow JFK conspiracy 
very much.

868
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:23,150
And the reason I don't is that there are
already,

869
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,670
like I think literally over a thousand

870
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:28,620
[inaudible] I've read.
I've read a few,

871
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:31,650
um,
I got into case closed.

872
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:35,150
That was a Vincent Bugliosi book.
Is that who it was?

873
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,850
But I was like,
this guy's got an agenda.

874
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:38,810
It just didn't,
it.

875
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:44,370
There's,
there's many books that you could read 

876
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:47,360
about the Kennedy assassination and some
of them favor the conspiracy and some of

877
00:41:47,361 --> 00:41:52,361
them favor the assassination.
I think they have a lot of them have 

878
00:41:52,361 --> 00:41:55,871
merit on both sides.
One thing that drives me crazy when 

879
00:41:55,871 --> 00:41:56,360
people say that,
you could never make that shot,

880
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:59,120
that's fucking bullshit.
That's bullshit.

881
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:02,930
This is why I know it's bullshit because
it was only like a couple hundred yards,

882
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:06,150
like a couple hundred yards shooting it 
something the size.

883
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:11,180
A person's head is easy.
What about Jesse Ventura trying to do 

884
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,470
the a three,
three shots against shots.

885
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,360
Stuff.
He didn't know what he's doing,

886
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:19,100
but I mean first of all,
you would if you were used to that rifle

887
00:42:19,101 --> 00:42:20,330
and you practice that,
someone said,

888
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,470
oh,
the scope was off.

889
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:26,800
I think that's bullshit too.
The reason why I think that's bullshit 

890
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:26,800
is because it's easy.
Naca scope off.

891
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,510
You have to have a direct chain of 
evidence between the time Lee Harvey 

892
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:32,690
Oswald had that scope shooting that 
rifle.

893
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:37,870
The moment he shot that rifle and then 
you have to hand it off to someone who 

894
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:38,570
checks the scope.
Right?

895
00:42:38,571 --> 00:42:42,020
Then because if you drop a rifle,
the scope goes off.

896
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,700
Just drop it.
I've done that before.

897
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:48,790
I dropped a rifle once when I was 
hunting in Wisconsin and my scope was 

898
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:50,510
off by six inches at 100 yards.
Just dropping it.

899
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:53,810
So the idea that he could have never 
made that shot because the scope is off.

900
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:58,990
Scopes get adjusted.
That's what happens when you drop a 

901
00:42:58,990 --> 00:42:58,990
scope,
they move.

902
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:01,490
That's a whole thing about ballistics.
You have to check them.

903
00:43:01,491 --> 00:43:04,490
You go to the range,
you set up a a lead sled,

904
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:07,400
you lay the other rifle down so it's 
perfectly stable.

905
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:10,280
You squeeze off a shot,
you use the binoculars,

906
00:43:10,281 --> 00:43:12,290
you find out where the the shot hit on 
the target,

907
00:43:12,291 --> 00:43:14,480
and then you adjust the scope.
They're adjustable.

908
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:17,240
So the idea that his scope was no good,
it's crazy.

909
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:20,210
The idea that that shot was too far to 
make insane.

910
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:22,640
It was only,
I think it was less than a hundred yards

911
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:25,130
when they think he made the first shot,
which is a chip shot.

912
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:27,410
That's the shot that you would make 
without even arrest.

913
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:30,170
Now he's making this shot resting on the
window,

914
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:35,260
so he's perfectly steady.
The idea that that was impossible as 

915
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:38,621
crazy.
The idea that no one can do that in 

916
00:43:38,621 --> 00:43:38,621
three shots,
that's been disproven.

917
00:43:38,621 --> 00:43:43,360
Someone can do it.
Someone who's really good at reloading 

918
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,420
and loading can do it just because Jesse
Ventura couldn't do it,

919
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:49,690
but Jesse super conspiracy mind is like,
he goes all in with the conspiracy 

920
00:43:49,881 --> 00:43:53,660
theorist,
the motivated reasoning part of doing it

921
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:55,880
just for a show or because he really 
believes it.

922
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:58,400
I worked with the same people that did 
his show,

923
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:03,430
the same people that did his show.
The reason why I did Joe Rogan 

924
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:06,731
questions,
everything is they wanted me to take 

925
00:44:06,731 --> 00:44:06,830
over Jesse show after it was done and I 
was uninterested.

926
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:08,180
I was like,
I'm not going.

927
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,400
I'm not that guy.
I'm not like the.

928
00:44:10,401 --> 00:44:12,410
I believe every conspiracy guy.
I go,

929
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:17,440
I think there's people.
I think people have a real weird vested 

930
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,550
interest in proving that things are 
conspiracy.

931
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:23,570
I'm interested in finding out what 
things really are like legitimately what

932
00:44:23,571 --> 00:44:24,560
they really are.
Yeah,

933
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,080
and even if I'm wrong,
like I'm.

934
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:31,120
I have.
I'm not interested in reinforcing 

935
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:34,961
things.
I've already said if I find out that 

936
00:44:34,961 --> 00:44:37,851
what I said was wrong,
I'm interested in repeating that I was 

937
00:44:37,851 --> 00:44:38,680
wrong as many times as they can to get 
it out to as many people as I can.

938
00:44:38,681 --> 00:44:43,681
Yeah,
I'm with you because I think it's 

939
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:43,681
important.
So this,

940
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:44,070
this JFK thing,
there's bullshit on both sides of it,

941
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:47,070
but the idea that this guy who went over
to Russia,

942
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,350
married a Russian citizen,
came back here,

943
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:53,160
was it mean he was absolutely involved 
in some shady,

944
00:44:53,161 --> 00:44:56,320
weird shit with Cuba.
He's a fucking weird guy.

945
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:01,680
Harvey Oswald was a weird guy.
The idea that he was completely 

946
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:01,680
innocent.
I'm not buying that either.

947
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:06,440
I don't know.
By the idea that it's proven that he 

948
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:11,000
acted entirely alone.
It's entirely possible that the other 

949
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,791
people who were helping him or 
motivating him or giving him an 

950
00:45:13,791 --> 00:45:14,420
instructions even.
Yeah.

951
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:18,750
The thing I don't think has really 
proven is the additional shooter theory.

952
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,960
It's not proven and there have been 
people that said they heard things from 

953
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:24,810
behind them.
The problem with that is chaos.

954
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,330
When you have gun shots,
first of all,

955
00:45:27,331 --> 00:45:30,600
gunshots in an area where dealey plaza,
the echos,

956
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:36,050
echos,
ring out and people claim to see things 

957
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:36,270
and hear things they even believed 
themselves.

958
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:41,040
Have you tell someone that you heard 
something in the bushes and then you run

959
00:45:41,041 --> 00:45:42,480
away.
That person will say,

960
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:45,690
I heard something in the bushes and then
other people were repeated.

961
00:45:45,691 --> 00:45:48,920
It becomes the narrative and it just 
gets real hard.

962
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:51,150
Create memories for you can you can.

963
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,920
You're going to point to somebody and 
say,

964
00:45:52,921 --> 00:45:57,921
there is somebody there and they'll 
think that was somebody that I liked it 

965
00:45:57,921 --> 00:45:57,921
because they.
Yeah,

966
00:45:57,921 --> 00:46:00,900
the brain is so chaotically working form
was memories in a very weird.

967
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:05,130
Especially when it comes to something 
that's so significant like the president

968
00:46:05,131 --> 00:46:10,131
getting shot or any sort of violent 
thing of this is something that gets 

969
00:46:10,131 --> 00:46:14,031
repeated ad nauseum about nine slash 11.
It's something that people point to 

970
00:46:14,031 --> 00:46:17,661
where they think that when the planes 
hit those buildings that there was 

971
00:46:17,661 --> 00:46:19,770
detonations that caused tower one tower 
two to fall.

972
00:46:19,771 --> 00:46:21,480
There's no way they would've fallen like
that.

973
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:25,320
Like when people say no,
they heard things in the buildings,

974
00:46:25,321 --> 00:46:28,920
they heard explosions.
People always say shit like that.

975
00:46:28,921 --> 00:46:33,921
And on top of that,
if you're dealing with a building 

976
00:46:33,921 --> 00:46:34,620
collapsing like that,
you're gonna hear a lot of crazy shit.

977
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:35,750
Yeah,
yeah.

978
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:37,910
You gotta that all going to be 
explosions,

979
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:39,050
things,
things are falling.

980
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:44,160
You know,
there were people falling off the 

981
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:44,160
buildings which goes to to

982
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,780
tower seven.
That's another one that keeps coming up 

983
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:48,350
the see if you can find the video.
Jamie,

984
00:46:48,351 --> 00:46:52,010
there's a video that shows what really 
happened in tower seven.

985
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:56,990
There's a guy who was a conspiracy guy.
He was really deep into conspiracies and

986
00:46:56,991 --> 00:46:59,510
then the more he started looking into 
tower seven,

987
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:04,810
the more he realized that everyone is 
just showing the very final video where 

988
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:09,641
tower seven collapses,
like a controlled demolition and it 

989
00:47:09,641 --> 00:47:09,980
looks exactly like a controlled 
demolition.

990
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,010
However,
if you find the full video,

991
00:47:13,011 --> 00:47:17,510
you see that the interior had collapsed 
moments before,

992
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:21,200
like quite a bit before Edward Current.
I think the video,

993
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:26,230
that's exactly who it is.
See if you can find that gentleman's 

994
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:27,590
video,
but he shows how the top of it,

995
00:47:27,591 --> 00:47:32,591
you could see the of tower seven given 
which is consistent with this idea that 

996
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:37,750
the diesel fuel that they had in the 
basement had created,

997
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:39,040
wasn't a diesel tank.

998
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:44,250
Yeah,
that was an early theory at the diesel 

999
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:44,250
fuel,
uh,

1000
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:44,250
that,
that was actually fueling the fire.

1001
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:47,830
But they never found any evidence that 
actually the diesel fuel contribution to

1002
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:51,670
the fires,
it was just a regular office buyers,

1003
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,740
which is what everybody finds those 
associates.

1004
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:58,780
Diesel never caught fire.
They might've been after the collapse.

1005
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:04,020
Uh,
I think they're recovered one of the 

1006
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:04,020
tanks with some days I'll still in it.
So,

1007
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:08,180
um,
series of diesel likely fed by a series 

1008
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:08,620
of diesel generators located in the 
lower floors,

1009
00:48:08,621 --> 00:48:10,660
which is where most of the fires were 
concentrated.

1010
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:15,730
So at least one of the diesel tower,
a diesel tanks didn't light up.

1011
00:48:15,731 --> 00:48:17,190
Is that what you're saying?
The,

1012
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:23,020
the theory,
this theory is that the diesel had 

1013
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:23,020
nothing to do with it.
Okay.

1014
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:23,950
So nist,
which,

1015
00:48:23,951 --> 00:48:26,620
uh,
if you are a conspiracy theory person,

1016
00:48:26,621 --> 00:48:29,710
they get really angry when you bring up.
Is that the government,

1017
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,600
the government man?
Um,

1018
00:48:31,601 --> 00:48:33,790
so I think this is an older video.
Yeah.

1019
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:35,180
This isn't the video,
Jim.

1020
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:37,650
There's one by Edwidge current.
Yeah.

1021
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:43,500
And what it does is it shows the top of 
the building cave in first quite a bit 

1022
00:48:44,381 --> 00:48:49,381
before the rest of the building.
So this idea that it all cave in like a 

1023
00:48:49,381 --> 00:48:52,540
controlled demolition because they 
detonated all those things.

1024
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:56,160
So Do,
do,

1025
00:48:56,161 --> 00:48:56,610
do,
do,

1026
00:48:56,611 --> 00:48:58,260
do.
Is that Edward Current?

1027
00:48:58,850 --> 00:49:00,810
I've got to find a good spot of the 
video to show it.

1028
00:49:00,811 --> 00:49:01,840
So.
Okay.

1029
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:04,050
Yeah.
So what happened,

1030
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:09,110
what they think was that the fire,
this is shitty design of a building and 

1031
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:13,520
the fire caused internal damage to all 
of the floors.

1032
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:14,230
Well,
you see that,

1033
00:49:14,231 --> 00:49:19,231
uh,
the World Trade Center fell basically 

1034
00:49:19,231 --> 00:49:19,760
against the side of a,
of seven.

1035
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:22,190
Yeah.
It was back of the building was all kind

1036
00:49:22,191 --> 00:49:25,040
of like all the windows were broken on 
the backside.

1037
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:28,760
There was one column in the middle of 
the back that was missing in a big chunk

1038
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:29,760
of the,
uh,

1039
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:32,990
lower west side was going to gouge it 
out.

1040
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,960
Right.
So this idea that it was just a fire.

1041
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:37,100
Yeah.
It wasn't justified.

1042
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:42,160
Yeah.
The fire is what triggered the collapse 

1043
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,370
eventually.
But the fact that all the windows were 

1044
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:47,651
missing from the south side contributed 
a lot to that because you've got a lot 

1045
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:47,720
of wind flow through.

1046
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:52,060
See if he's got the.
I Dunno mate,

1047
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:55,860
maybe this is a bad thing to do while 
you're actually doing the show.

1048
00:49:55,861 --> 00:50:00,861
So this is what the idea is,
the Nis computer models that all these 

1049
00:50:00,861 --> 00:50:02,960
floors had collapsed inside.
Outside collapsed too.

1050
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:05,520
Yeah.
But what this guy,

1051
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:08,790
Edward current had showed in his video,
I think it was him,

1052
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,610
was he showed that the top part that 
past.

1053
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:13,860
Yeah,
the top penthouse had collapsed first.

1054
00:50:13,861 --> 00:50:15,120
There it is.
CVC,

1055
00:50:15,121 --> 00:50:17,530
the pen house collapsing.
See is sinking it up.

1056
00:50:17,531 --> 00:50:19,290
But with the two,
the two videos,

1057
00:50:19,291 --> 00:50:22,110
the simulation.
So it's sitting up there and then boom,

1058
00:50:22,111 --> 00:50:25,560
you see it collapsed and so the windows 
breaking down.

1059
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:27,350
Exactly.
And that's that.

1060
00:50:27,351 --> 00:50:28,370
No one ever shows

1061
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:30,370
and then it gives in,
right,

1062
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:34,820
so this is not a quick thing like a 
controlled demolition.

1063
00:50:34,821 --> 00:50:39,821
All those windows giving in is 
indicative of all those floors 

1064
00:50:39,821 --> 00:50:42,170
collapsing probably more than it is the 
idea of the,

1065
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:44,870
you know,
the people that want to see conspiracy,

1066
00:50:44,871 --> 00:50:49,871
think that those bombs were going off 
there and that as those definitions or 

1067
00:50:49,871 --> 00:50:53,700
explosions were going off that that's 
what caused all those floors to collapse

1068
00:50:53,701 --> 00:50:58,701
on top of each other.
And I think that's what's talking about 

1069
00:50:58,701 --> 00:50:59,120
what the core beliefs of the conspiracy 
theories with nine slash 11.

1070
00:50:59,121 --> 00:50:59,840
This,
this back,

1071
00:50:59,841 --> 00:51:04,040
that world trade center seven looks like
a controlled demolition is core belief,

1072
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:07,880
but when you actually get into something
and describe what's actually happening,

1073
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:13,180
you have to go through a much more 
complicated conspiracy theory at a much 

1074
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:16,721
more complicated way of looking at what 
actually happened and now they're trying

1075
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:22,241
to do a complicated study of World Trade
Center seven at the University of 

1076
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:22,760
Alaska.

1077
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:27,790
This is something paid for by architects
and engineers when nine slash 11 truth 

1078
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:31,090
that trying to actually figure out how 
they can reconcile controlled demolition

1079
00:51:31,341 --> 00:51:33,500
with the fact that it collapsed the way 
it did,

1080
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:39,380
so they're trying to actually explain 
something which doesn't really need to 

1081
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:40,220
explain to him because the explanation 
has been done by nist already.

1082
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:45,310
So what they're trying to do is find 
something that reinforces their initial 

1083
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:49,100
idea instead of it just look at the 
facts itself saying,

1084
00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:54,130
Oh,
you look at the top of the penthouse 

1085
00:51:54,130 --> 00:51:56,140
collapsing.
That's not indicative of a controlled 

1086
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:58,361
demolition.
That's indicative of the model that Nis 

1087
00:51:58,361 --> 00:51:58,370
described,
which is a slow burn inside.

1088
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:02,180
Extremely hot deterioration of all the 
internal structure.

1089
00:52:02,181 --> 00:52:05,250
Everything starts to collapse inside.
And then the outside Clabsi to.

1090
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:10,420
Well,
some of them will say that that is 

1091
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:10,420
actually how controlled demolitions are 
done.

1092
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:13,781
You blow up the interior of the building
first and then you blow the exterior of 

1093
00:52:13,781 --> 00:52:13,781
the building.

1094
00:52:13,781 --> 00:52:18,250
Uh,
but the problem is that none of the 

1095
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:20,111
exterior columns were cut.
There was no explosion scene on the 

1096
00:52:20,111 --> 00:52:22,010
exterior columns.
If you look at the World Trade Center,

1097
00:52:22,011 --> 00:52:23,640
one or two coming down,
yeah,

1098
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:28,650
you can kind of imagine their explosions
going all the way down because of those 

1099
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:28,730
things that looked like explosions from 
the folding floors,

1100
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:31,790
but in seven you just see the building 
kind of just going to crumble down.

1101
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:37,360
So they have to kind of explain that.
So they come up with this study that 

1102
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:37,360
they funded.
It's custom,

1103
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:40,230
nearly $400,000,
uh,

1104
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:45,230
and they're trying to come up with an 
explanation that doesn't involve fire a,

1105
00:52:45,231 --> 00:52:48,890
so that saying like if,
if it was controlled demolition than the

1106
00:52:48,891 --> 00:52:53,400
way they would have done it is blowing 
up these interior columns a and it would

1107
00:52:53,401 --> 00:52:57,050
have pulled in the exterior and 
collapsed the way we see in the video.

1108
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:02,320
And I think that the,
some of them say that the penthouse 

1109
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,620
thing was a separate thing because they 
wanted to have a neat demolition.

1110
00:53:03,621 --> 00:53:06,750
So they first of all blew up a few 
floors just underneath the penthouse.

1111
00:53:06,751 --> 00:53:10,640
So neagley collapsed inside the building
and then they blew up some floors at the

1112
00:53:10,641 --> 00:53:15,641
bottom.
So he's all fell in itself without 

1113
00:53:15,641 --> 00:53:18,191
damaging the surrounding buildings.
So they've got this complex theory and 

1114
00:53:18,191 --> 00:53:22,031
it's based on confirmation bias.
It's based on confirming this idea that 

1115
00:53:22,031 --> 00:53:25,541
this is a controlled demolition,
not on examining the whole thing as it 

1116
00:53:25,541 --> 00:53:25,800
and going,
okay,

1117
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:29,130
is it possible that the model is correct
and that these.

1118
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:34,400
Look,
the thing that I bring up to people all 

1119
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:34,400
the time when they want to talk about 
conspiracies,

1120
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,380
there is a real conspiracy nine slash 11
and that's the fact that it happened.

1121
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:40,140
The fact that they did fly planes into 
buildings,

1122
00:53:40,141 --> 00:53:42,030
that's a conspiracy and they pulled it 
off.

1123
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:47,010
That actually did happen.
People don't want that to be it.

1124
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:52,040
They want it to be a much broader 
conspiracy involving world governments 

1125
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:54,180
that are trying to close in on,
you know,

1126
00:53:54,181 --> 00:53:56,850
all our rights and this is the way to do
it.

1127
00:53:56,851 --> 00:53:57,020
And

1128
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:58,740
Yeah,
his proportionality,

1129
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:02,810
people want something to be in 
proportion to the size of the event when

1130
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:07,820
they think just like a bunch of Arabs 
with knives isn't a big enough cause.

1131
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:11,550
So they think that it has to be 
something.

1132
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:14,130
We have more significant end,
even like with the physics of it,

1133
00:54:14,131 --> 00:54:17,490
they think he have the plane flew into 
the building and it didn't collapse.

1134
00:54:17,491 --> 00:54:19,860
So why would it,
why would it collapse?

1135
00:54:19,861 --> 00:54:21,210
Some of them,
some people don't think that,

1136
00:54:21,211 --> 00:54:24,350
uh,
the plane we even have in the hall,

1137
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:28,350
they think it would have been bounced 
off or who the fluxing said,

1138
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:29,540
oh,
some of them think that the,

1139
00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:32,460
the tower would have knocked over.
Really?

1140
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:37,490
Yeah.
But these are people who have really no 

1141
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:39,801
conception whatsoever,
a physics and there's a minority of 

1142
00:54:39,801 --> 00:54:39,801
people,
but you'll find people who,

1143
00:54:39,801 --> 00:54:43,380
who don't understand how aluminum can 
cut through steel,

1144
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:46,530
you know,
the columns of the exterior of the World

1145
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:50,430
Trade Center were made of steel,
very strong steel and planes are made of

1146
00:54:50,431 --> 00:54:51,480
mostly aluminum.

1147
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:55,380
So they don't understand how a plane 
made of aluminum,

1148
00:54:55,381 --> 00:54:57,060
which is soft,
can go through steel,

1149
00:54:57,061 --> 00:55:01,410
which is very hard and strong.
And the example I always give to them is

1150
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:04,740
the ping pong ball going through a ping 
pong paddle.

1151
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,340
If you make it go fast enough.
This is something I think mythbusters do

1152
00:55:08,341 --> 00:55:10,200
and various other people have done.
Uh,

1153
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:15,210
you,
you send a regular ping pong ball a 500 

1154
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:17,040
miles an hour into a ping pong paddle 
and it just goes straight through.

1155
00:55:17,041 --> 00:55:22,041
It leaves a ping pong ball hole in the 
middle of it and that's just what 

1156
00:55:22,041 --> 00:55:23,640
happened on nine slash 11.
The planes were going 500 miles an hour.

1157
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,320
So you could do that with a ping pong 
ball.

1158
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:25,720
You can.

1159
00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:27,220
Wow,
that makes sense.

1160
00:55:27,221 --> 00:55:28,410
It's just,
well,

1161
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:33,600
for the planes to the,
the amount of mass you're dealing with 

1162
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,570
two in the speed from 500 miles an hour.

1163
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:36,480
Yeah.
And then you don't need to be,

1164
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:39,420
it doesn't even need to be relatively 
that much mass.

1165
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:44,800
A ping pong ball,
it weighs one gram and a paddle weighs 

1166
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:45,460
like 200 grams or something.
So.

1167
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:50,910
And you wouldn't think you've seen it.
You've seen ping pong paddles that is 

1168
00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:54,890
laminated wood and rubber and you've got
this flimsy little bowl is how on earth 

1169
00:55:54,890 --> 00:55:56,190
is that going to go through?
That switch is unintuitive,

1170
00:55:56,450 --> 00:56:01,450
right?
So you can understand how people would 

1171
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:03,560
be confused about why the planes left 
these little road runner

1172
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:06,640
civic and find that you had the 
mythbusters thing.

1173
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:08,710
I want to see that.
I hear it is.

1174
00:56:08,711 --> 00:56:09,790
Wow.
That was a whole.

1175
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:13,300
So they have some crazy air cannon.
Yup.

1176
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:14,680
Blows off.
Okay.

1177
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:16,990
Here's the problem with that though.
Here's the problem with that.

1178
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,680
They're doing that right in front.
I

1179
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:21,740
have that they have to do with the pink 
phone bulk because it will slow down,

1180
00:56:21,741 --> 00:56:23,980
but I understand.
But you're also with the

1181
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,520
actual air.
Yeah,

1182
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:26,360
right.
It's the.

1183
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:29,530
But it is the ping pong table.
We can see it in slow motion.

1184
00:56:29,531 --> 00:56:32,050
Yeah.
Because what I was going to bring up was

1185
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:37,410
a guy killed himself once accidentally 
on a movie set because he took an 

1186
00:56:37,511 --> 00:56:42,250
unloaded gun and he shot it into his 
temple and it blew his brains out.

1187
00:56:42,310 --> 00:56:43,300
Yeah.
It was blank,

1188
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:48,610
but the fact that it was a blank didn't 
stop that air from blowing through.

1189
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:54,270
There is a thing that people do when 
they hunt in Alaska and in an incredibly

1190
00:56:55,691 --> 00:56:58,960
moist climates and places where there's 
a lot of dirt and debris,

1191
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:04,260
they will put tape over the top of the 
rifle over the end of the barrel where 

1192
00:57:04,661 --> 00:57:09,661
the bullet comes over or they even use a
condom and it has no effect whatsoever 

1193
00:57:10,031 --> 00:57:15,031
on the accuracy of the bullet because 
the air coming out of the rifle barrel 

1194
00:57:15,041 --> 00:57:18,770
from the explosion blows that tape out 
before the bill.

1195
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:19,970
It even gets to it.
Yeah.

1196
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:21,270
Yeah.
But you know,

1197
00:57:21,330 --> 00:57:24,670
the only reason they have to have the 
thing right at the end of the barrel,

1198
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:25,990
uh,
is the painful bowl,

1199
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:31,000
but slow down in the say satellites.
If you felt something a little bit 

1200
00:57:31,901 --> 00:57:34,390
heavier but still pretty small,
it will go through it.

1201
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:34,960
Yeah.
No,

1202
00:57:34,961 --> 00:57:39,961
that makes sense.
And you think you've got to scale it up 

1203
00:57:39,961 --> 00:57:39,961
like,
you know,

1204
00:57:39,961 --> 00:57:39,961
imagine like a beer barrel,
uh,

1205
00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:44,110
made a steel or aluminum weighs like 100
pounds or whatever.

1206
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:49,140
What is full?
And he imagined that slamming into 

1207
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:51,871
something.
If I have a ping pong ball can do 

1208
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:51,871
something at 500 miles an hour,
uh,

1209
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:53,610
be a barrel at five miles an hour.
I couldn't do it.

1210
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:55,870
An awful amount of damage,
probably go right through a building.

1211
00:57:55,930 --> 00:58:00,930
Yeah.
And then you scale up from like a beer 

1212
00:58:00,930 --> 00:58:01,000
barrel to a 200 ton plane.

1213
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:06,060
Yeah.
And 200 tons hitting something at 500 

1214
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:07,060
miles an hour.
It doesn't matter that it's,

1215
00:58:07,090 --> 00:58:08,260
you know,
it's made out of aluminum.

1216
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:13,440
It's still 200 tons of something.
If it was just a big bag of water 

1217
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:17,581
hitting something at 500 miles an hour,
it would still make a hole in the side 

1218
00:58:17,581 --> 00:58:21,031
of the building.
I think this is a problem with a lot of 

1219
00:58:21,031 --> 00:58:23,551
these theories is that a lot of the 
people that are involved in these 

1220
00:58:23,551 --> 00:58:26,341
theories are either not educated in what
they're talking about because there are 

1221
00:58:26,341 --> 00:58:30,601
some various nuances to things like this
ping pong ball trick or they don't.

1222
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:37,650
They don't want to be like,
they don't want to look at anything that

1223
00:58:38,111 --> 00:58:42,070
takes away from this conspiracy.
They don't want to look at anything that

1224
00:58:42,071 --> 00:58:47,071
debunks or disproves.
They just want confirmation of their 

1225
00:58:47,071 --> 00:58:50,371
initial idea that this is some big grand
conspiracy that someone is in on it and 

1226
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:53,620
it's happening right before our eyes.

1227
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:54,380
Yeah.
Yeah.

1228
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:59,350
It's quite hard to even get one point 
past a lot of people.

1229
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:02,700
If someone starts out with that,
that theory,

1230
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:07,710
that aluminum cannot cut steel,
then that just becomes the gatekeeping 

1231
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:12,550
obstacle that you have to get past.
If you can't disprove that one thing,

1232
00:59:12,551 --> 00:59:17,551
it does.
Nothing else matters really for them 

1233
00:59:17,551 --> 00:59:17,551
because the,
you know,

1234
00:59:17,551 --> 00:59:17,551
the plane couldn't have entered the 
building.

1235
00:59:17,551 --> 00:59:19,340
Therefore everything is a conspiracy.
So you,

1236
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:20,980
you,
you kind of have to address these.

1237
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:22,550
Yeah,
you have to.

1238
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:27,580
In some,
it's important for people before they 

1239
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:27,580
decide that this is,
you know,

1240
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:32,150
that the government spray and things in 
the sky or that the world is flat or 

1241
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:32,150
whatever,
whatever these things are.

1242
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:34,070
It's important to look at all the 
evidence.

1243
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:39,071
These youtube videos,
one of the real problems with them is 

1244
00:59:39,071 --> 00:59:39,230
that they get to play out without being 
interrupted.

1245
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:44,470
Much like a podcast on unfortunately,
but they get to have these grand 

1246
00:59:45,111 --> 00:59:50,111
statements without anyone who's an 
expert stepping in and stopping them and

1247
00:59:50,331 --> 00:59:50,660
saying,
well,

1248
00:59:50,661 --> 00:59:53,000
that's not true and here's why it's not 
true and here's why.

1249
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:58,000
He can prove that it's not true,
which would just derail most of these 

1250
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:58,960
conspiracy theories really quickly.
Yeah.

1251
00:59:58,961 --> 01:00:01,640
And that's kind of the brainwash aspects
of these videos.

1252
01:00:01,970 --> 01:00:03,650
People,
uh,

1253
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:09,340
people watch these three hour videos.
Kind of surprised me a first and I was 

1254
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:12,260
surprised that people would listen to a 
three hour podcast,

1255
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:13,250
but,
you know,

1256
01:00:13,251 --> 01:00:15,330
once you get going in something,
you know,

1257
01:00:15,370 --> 01:00:17,920
the first time I was on your podcast,
eight at the time went by light line,

1258
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:20,270
nothing.
And if you're into something and you get

1259
01:00:20,271 --> 01:00:25,271
sucked into it and you,
you've got this really interesting 

1260
01:00:25,271 --> 01:00:25,271
theory and it's like all these 
revelations like,

1261
01:00:25,271 --> 01:00:25,780
oh my God,
I'm getting the,

1262
01:00:25,890 --> 01:00:28,470
the real skinny on the world.
Uh,

1263
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:29,610
yeah,
you,

1264
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:31,280
you just,
you,

1265
01:00:31,530 --> 01:00:33,800
you just get sucked in.
And then when it's finished,

1266
01:00:33,801 --> 01:00:38,801
you on kind of a dopamine high and you 
want to do more and you also feel like 

1267
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:41,270
you're in on something that people don't
know and you want to tell them about it.

1268
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:43,040
Oh yeah.
And I've been there.

1269
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:48,250
I've been there.
I've always tell people the dumbest one 

1270
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:50,660
ever believed in was a stupid tubes that
fly through the air.

1271
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,610
Rogers or.
Yeah,

1272
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:54,830
I was hook,
line and sinker.

1273
01:00:54,831 --> 01:00:59,831
I would go outside and I would try to 
find those things streaking across the 

1274
01:00:59,931 --> 01:01:01,070
sky.
Um,

1275
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:05,510
what it was was that there was a video 
that was made called Roswell rods and it

1276
01:01:05,511 --> 01:01:08,630
was trying to say that there was these 
bugs,

1277
01:01:09,170 --> 01:01:14,170
like things that look like jellyfish,
that we're flying through the air so 

1278
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:14,170
fast.
The naked eye couldn't see them,

1279
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:19,001
but they were catching on video cameras.
And then finally someone figured it out 

1280
01:01:19,001 --> 01:01:23,350
that what it really was was you could 
have an hd camera right next to a 

1281
01:01:23,350 --> 01:01:27,731
standard definition camera and the 
standard see those things flying across 

1282
01:01:27,731 --> 01:01:29,150
the sky.
It's just a video artifact.

1283
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:34,310
When the camera cannot pick up those,
those bugs,

1284
01:01:34,430 --> 01:01:37,820
it elongates them.
And streaks them across the camera.

1285
01:01:37,830 --> 01:01:39,860
Motion Blur,
motion blur.

1286
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:42,260
And this guy,
this guy came to one of my,

1287
01:01:42,261 --> 01:01:45,140
uh,
UFC q and a's once and he waited in line

1288
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:48,440
and he yelled out,
you're wrong about the rods.

1289
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,330
The rods are real.
I can prove it.

1290
01:01:52,370 --> 01:01:55,340
Silly Fella.
But these,

1291
01:01:55,840 --> 01:02:00,470
that was a monster quest at proven that 
on television they'd set up two cameras.

1292
01:02:00,530 --> 01:02:05,530
Yeah.
It's so hard when it's actually been 

1293
01:02:05,530 --> 01:02:07,451
proven and you've got this conclusive 
proof and yet there are still loads and 

1294
01:02:07,451 --> 01:02:09,620
loads of people who believe in enrolled 
doesn't look how it looks,

1295
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:15,160
how he was describing that.
It looks like some kind of alien 

1296
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:17,250
jellyfish that's so fast.
It flies through the air faster.

1297
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,560
You can see.
Yeah.

1298
01:02:18,561 --> 01:02:20,190
I mean the problem is these guys have

1299
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:25,190
a vested interest in it.
Being real is motivated and not 

1300
01:02:25,190 --> 01:02:28,101
necessarily by money.
They just motivated because once they 

1301
01:02:28,101 --> 01:02:31,761
believe something,
they feel like that privy to this 

1302
01:02:31,761 --> 01:02:33,831
special knowledge,
it's just going to be such a letdown if 

1303
01:02:33,831 --> 01:02:34,290
they're wrong.
I think it's that end money man.

1304
01:02:34,291 --> 01:02:35,850
He sold.
He sold a bunch of videos.

1305
01:02:35,851 --> 01:02:37,740
I bought them.
I bought two of those bitches.

1306
01:02:38,650 --> 01:02:43,650
Oh,
I always try to start out with the 

1307
01:02:43,650 --> 01:02:43,650
assumption that people are not,
you know,

1308
01:02:43,650 --> 01:02:45,180
they're basically good people.
They're not trying to make money.

1309
01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:46,110
Right.
Well,

1310
01:02:46,111 --> 01:02:49,260
I think they also get caught up in the 
business of whatever it is.

1311
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:55,070
If you're in the UFO business and then 
someone comes along and shuts down your 

1312
01:02:55,070 --> 01:02:56,250
business,
you're going to try to.

1313
01:02:56,251 --> 01:02:58,050
Well,
let me sort of.

1314
01:02:58,140 --> 01:02:59,460
They're not going to look at it 
objectively.

1315
01:02:59,461 --> 01:03:01,500
They're gonna go,
I want to keep my business alive.

1316
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,000
I want to protect my business.
Yes.

1317
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:08,300
Yeah.
Almost like a architects and engineers 

1318
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:10,431
when nine slash 11 truth there,
they're like a half million dollar a 

1319
01:03:10,431 --> 01:03:11,040
year business.
Uh,

1320
01:03:11,041 --> 01:03:15,890
they taking between 400 and $800,000
a year and the precedent of the,

1321
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:20,550
the architects and engineers as he gets 
paid a salary of $85,000

1322
01:03:20,551 --> 01:03:25,551
a year and he gets these expenses paid.
Now that doesn't mean that he doesn't 

1323
01:03:25,551 --> 01:03:26,940
believe in what he's doing.
He,

1324
01:03:26,941 --> 01:03:31,941
I'm sure studied how it is like a 
hardcore believer in nine slash 11 

1325
01:03:31,941 --> 01:03:34,080
truth.
But over the last 10 years,

1326
01:03:34,590 --> 01:03:37,380
this has become his life and his 
livelihood.

1327
01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:43,250
So even if he really believes it,
he still has this additional level of 

1328
01:03:43,250 --> 01:03:48,081
motivation to not disprove things.
How many people are in architects and 

1329
01:03:48,081 --> 01:03:50,490
engineers for nine slash 11?
Truth really depends how you count it.

1330
01:03:50,491 --> 01:03:51,290
Like they,
uh,

1331
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:56,720
they say they have like thousands of 
architects and engineers actually 

1332
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:56,790
signing the petition.

1333
01:03:57,390 --> 01:04:02,390
I think they have like a,
maybe a few hundred working structural 

1334
01:04:02,971 --> 01:04:04,750
engineers.
Uh,

1335
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:10,040
what do you think of their take on it?
That take is kind of like the standard 

1336
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:15,320
of a nine slash 11 truth.
They think that it's a controlled 

1337
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:15,960
demolition and I think they have all 
this evidence.

1338
01:04:15,961 --> 01:04:18,750
We controlled demolition,
but it's not very good.

1339
01:04:18,810 --> 01:04:20,050
Evidence is,
uh,

1340
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:26,300
one of the experts is a,
a high school physics teacher and you 

1341
01:04:27,151 --> 01:04:32,151
know,
he's already fairly good at high school 

1342
01:04:32,151 --> 01:04:33,261
physics,
but he just makes them very simple 

1343
01:04:33,261 --> 01:04:34,220
mistakes about physics,
uh,

1344
01:04:34,630 --> 01:04:36,570
of the,
the folding towers.

1345
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:39,750
And they repeat this on their website,
unquestioningly.

1346
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:45,230
Uh,
there's another guy who's like the 

1347
01:04:45,230 --> 01:04:46,380
expert on the Nano thermite residue that
was found,

1348
01:04:46,410 --> 01:04:51,410
you know,
they think that these reading grade 

1349
01:04:51,410 --> 01:04:53,180
specs of what looks like a paint and 
rust was actually a nano thermite,

1350
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:59,440
uh,
since he's now like an expert on their 

1351
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:02,631
site,
he gets to say whatever he likes and 

1352
01:05:02,631 --> 01:05:05,061
he's got this one theory about how the 
bits of steel that flew out of the 

1353
01:05:05,061 --> 01:05:09,201
building had these,
none of them like rockets attached to 

1354
01:05:09,201 --> 01:05:12,381
them,
which is why they were leaving these 

1355
01:05:12,381 --> 01:05:12,570
trails of smoke behind when they fell 
down.

1356
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:17,900
And these are things that are just 
pretty ridiculous and you can kind of 

1357
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:21,750
debunk them with physics,
but they'll have none of it because 

1358
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:23,770
they've got the experts saying something
and you can't,

1359
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:29,670
uh,
you can't deny the fact that you can't 

1360
01:05:29,670 --> 01:05:30,160
deny that you can't to debunk their 
experts because the experts,

1361
01:05:30,161 --> 01:05:30,650
you know,
where,

1362
01:05:30,651 --> 01:05:33,040
where would you knew more about a high 
school physics teacher about physics?

1363
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:34,700
Where would you know more about nano to 
them?

1364
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:36,570
Then this guy who was an expert in Nano 
third,

1365
01:05:36,571 --> 01:05:41,571
right?
So that they've got all these supposed 

1366
01:05:41,571 --> 01:05:43,390
expertise,
making these mistakes,

1367
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,050
about nine slash 11,
like the,

1368
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:45,980
the,
the,

1369
01:05:46,010 --> 01:05:51,010
the president has this ridiculous 
demonstration that he does where he 

1370
01:05:51,010 --> 01:05:54,631
holds up to cardboard boxes and 
underneath one of them is empty space 

1371
01:05:54,631 --> 01:05:56,140
underneath the other one there's a,
there's a tower,

1372
01:05:56,410 --> 01:06:01,410
a drops them and the this one falls to 
the ground and this one bounces off the 

1373
01:06:01,410 --> 01:06:03,400
cardboard box and is basically saying 
this is what should have happened.

1374
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:08,940
This upper portion should have stopped 
on the way down and it's using these 

1375
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:13,681
cardboard boxes and as a demonstration.
But the ridiculous oversimplifications 

1376
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,250
of what actually happened.

1377
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:21,260
Yeah.
I don't know too much about the 

1378
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:22,760
engineer's take on things,
you know,

1379
01:06:22,830 --> 01:06:27,830
from architects and engineers.
I really didn't bother getting into it 

1380
01:06:27,830 --> 01:06:31,730
too much,
but I just do know that it's several 

1381
01:06:31,730 --> 01:06:34,140
hundred people if not over a thousand 
and they're all over the world.

1382
01:06:34,710 --> 01:06:38,910
But how many people have studied it that
disagree with them?

1383
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:43,520
Like how many and how good are the 
artists that are in our.

1384
01:06:43,580 --> 01:06:46,170
I mean there's a lot of architects and a
lot of engineers

1385
01:06:46,330 --> 01:06:46,910
world.
Yeah.

1386
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:51,911
That they recently tried to get a motion
passed at the American Institute of 

1387
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:52,800
Architects,
uh,

1388
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:57,820
which was basically a reopen a world 
trade center seven and they went to the 

1389
01:06:58,340 --> 01:07:01,750
convention and they stood up and they 
gave speeches and okay,

1390
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,500
the,
all the evidence,

1391
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:08,620
uh,
about why will the building seven 

1392
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:11,960
investigation to been reopened and they 
took a vote and I think it was about 

1393
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:15,590
something like 97 to three present 
against doing this.

1394
01:07:15,591 --> 01:07:18,110
So all of the architects who are 
actually there,

1395
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:20,450
these professional architects,
97 percent,

1396
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:24,020
I can't remember the exact figures,
but it's around that voted against this.

1397
01:07:24,350 --> 01:07:25,910
So even though,
yeah,

1398
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:29,660
even though there are thousands of 
signatures to the,

1399
01:07:29,661 --> 01:07:33,230
a nine slash 11 petition who are 
actually architects,

1400
01:07:33,890 --> 01:07:38,890
when you actually look at the actual 
millions of architects that are out 

1401
01:07:38,890 --> 01:07:41,330
there in the world is a very small 
fraction of that.

1402
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:46,600
Right?
But how many of those millions of 

1403
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:46,600
studied it.

1404
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:50,810
I would like to see someone who's like a
real legitimate top of the food chain 

1405
01:07:50,810 --> 01:07:55,180
architect from the deep debunking side 
view it from someone who

1406
01:07:55,550 --> 01:08:00,440
is absolutely considered people.
Lots of people have done various studies

1407
01:08:00,441 --> 01:08:03,320
on nine slash 11,
the collapse of the building.

1408
01:08:03,321 --> 01:08:08,321
There was a book by a guy from London,
I think he's cool thing through a 

1409
01:08:08,390 --> 01:08:13,390
Chinese guy from London who wrote a book
on a progressive collapses in large,

1410
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:17,450
came out last year,
Twenty Sixteen,

1411
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:21,060
and it discusses why buildings seven 
collapsed,

1412
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:23,810
why the World Trade Center towers 
collapsed amongst a whole bunch of other

1413
01:08:23,811 --> 01:08:25,190
buildings.
Why we are the collapse,

1414
01:08:25,191 --> 01:08:30,191
so it didn't.
So there are lots of people who do 

1415
01:08:30,191 --> 01:08:33,071
actually study it and within a nine 
slash 11 architects and engineers when 

1416
01:08:33,071 --> 01:08:37,301
nine slash 11,
they vast majority of them have not 

1417
01:08:37,301 --> 01:08:41,261
studied it.
If you look at their position 

1418
01:08:41,261 --> 01:08:41,261
statements,
if you look,

1419
01:08:41,261 --> 01:08:45,660
they asked everybody who joins it writes
a little statement which goes on the 

1420
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:45,660
website.
They'll say things like,

1421
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:49,760
I watched loose change and that my eyes,
oh yeah.

1422
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:53,990
It looked weird to me.
That's like the real common thing.

1423
01:08:53,991 --> 01:08:55,820
You know that when I saw the towers 
fall,

1424
01:08:55,821 --> 01:08:57,830
I knew it wasn't.
Know the.

1425
01:08:58,370 --> 01:09:02,300
It wasn't very.
It wasn't a a regular collapsed.

1426
01:09:02,330 --> 01:09:03,860
It looked weird to me is my favorite 
one.

1427
01:09:03,950 --> 01:09:05,440
It didn't.
But it did look weird.

1428
01:09:05,441 --> 01:09:07,770
It looks weird to me.
Says,

1429
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:10,350
yeah.
Then an architect saying it looked weird

1430
01:09:10,351 --> 01:09:11,770
to them,
hey,

1431
01:09:11,990 --> 01:09:16,990
look what to everybody,
and no one has seen anything like that 

1432
01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:16,990
before.
It was unprecedented.

1433
01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:18,140
You have the Saturn five rocket taking 
off.

1434
01:09:18,141 --> 01:09:20,300
It looks weird because it hadn't 
happened before.

1435
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:21,950
Yeah.
There's a lot of things that look weird.

1436
01:09:23,150 --> 01:09:28,150
What other things do you think that you 
and I disagree on A.

1437
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:32,090
I think maybe the morgellons are more 
jealous thing.

1438
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:37,130
Oh,
you are more prone to think that is a 

1439
01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:38,300
real thing because you went to the 
morgellons conference.

1440
01:09:38,350 --> 01:09:38,820
Not that it's

1441
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:41,550
thing that there's real fibers growing 
out of people,

1442
01:09:41,730 --> 01:09:46,170
but that there's neurotoxic.
This is what I got from a doctor.

1443
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:51,680
The doctor who had more Magellan's is at
the clinic who was a very reasonable 

1444
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:55,161
guy.
William Coffee I think is that his name 

1445
01:09:55,161 --> 01:09:55,590
is.
He has lyme disease and he said the vast

1446
01:09:55,591 --> 01:10:00,591
majority of the people that have more 
challenge also have lyme disease and he 

1447
01:10:00,591 --> 01:10:03,300
believes that there is a neurotoxic 
quality to lyme disease that affects the

1448
01:10:03,301 --> 01:10:06,090
way you see things and even causes 
hallucinations.

1449
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:11,360
And he witnessed it himself.
He said I had hallucinated and saw 

1450
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:13,680
something crawling across the surface of
my eyeballs in the mirror,

1451
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:18,980
but it wasn't a real thing.
I couldn't see it after I looked at it 

1452
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:19,380
again,
it was gone.

1453
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:23,730
But I did see it for a moment and he's 
convinced that lyme disease,

1454
01:10:23,731 --> 01:10:27,270
when you catch lyme disease,
you're not necessarily catching.

1455
01:10:27,270 --> 01:10:31,110
It's not like you know you have tylenol,
you know something that's isolated.

1456
01:10:31,111 --> 01:10:33,390
It's very specific.
When you get tylenol,

1457
01:10:33,391 --> 01:10:34,920
you're getting tylenol.
He's like,

1458
01:10:34,921 --> 01:10:38,940
when you get bit by a tick that has lyme
disease,

1459
01:10:39,210 --> 01:10:44,210
you could get a host of pathogens and 
there's what would test positive for 

1460
01:10:44,821 --> 01:10:47,190
lyme disease.
It's very tricky to find someone to.

1461
01:10:48,030 --> 01:10:50,300
This doctor is when one guy,
William Lovey,

1462
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:55,380
like he,
he's a guy who thinks he has more 

1463
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:55,380
morgellons or he thinks he has chronic 
lyme,

1464
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:58,200
but he definitely has chronic lyme and 
he thinks that what morgellons is,

1465
01:10:58,230 --> 01:11:03,230
is a side effect of chronic lyme where 
people start thinking there's fibers 

1466
01:11:03,230 --> 01:11:07,911
growing their skin.
And so they think that fibers that come 

1467
01:11:07,911 --> 01:11:11,841
from their clothes or carpets,
they get stuck to someplace they'd been 

1468
01:11:11,841 --> 01:11:13,470
itching because they opened up a wound 
and that they start

1469
01:11:14,490 --> 01:11:17,460
misinterpreting that as being something 
that's grown out of their skin.

1470
01:11:18,390 --> 01:11:19,770
Yeah.
Well I would agree with that part of it.

1471
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:21,600
Yeah.
But that's what he thinks.

1472
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:23,520
So really,
he's not really a morgellons guy.

1473
01:11:23,521 --> 01:11:26,010
He's a chronic lyme guy.
Yes he is.

1474
01:11:26,070 --> 01:11:31,070
He's a more jealous guy in the fact that
he has seen the hallucinations,

1475
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:34,830
but because of the fact that he's a 
doctor and scientifically minded,

1476
01:11:35,130 --> 01:11:40,130
he believes that he's watching his own 
mind play tricks on him and he thinks 

1477
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:44,991
there's neurotoxic qualities to whatever
the pathogens that are in lyme disease 

1478
01:11:44,991 --> 01:11:45,240
are.
Yeah.

1479
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:46,110
Yeah.
Well,

1480
01:11:46,111 --> 01:11:49,200
I guess I don't disagree with you too 
much then I would disagree with you,

1481
01:11:49,201 --> 01:11:51,930
I think on chronic line,
but I think you probably know more about

1482
01:11:51,931 --> 01:11:56,931
it than I do from what I've seen.
Like most doctors don't think chronic 

1483
01:11:56,931 --> 01:12:01,521
lyme is a real thing.
It depends on how long you have it for 

1484
01:12:01,521 --> 01:12:01,560
before you get it treated.

1485
01:12:01,590 --> 01:12:05,040
That's the real issue is that there's 
this lyme syndrome and chronic lyme,

1486
01:12:05,041 --> 01:12:08,990
which some people think there's a 
chronic infection and other people think

1487
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:13,991
that there's just chronic effects 
leftover from having the lyme disease 

1488
01:12:13,991 --> 01:12:15,540
for a long time.
I think there's a lot of variability.

1489
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:20,750
I think one,
I mean I think we'd probably have to 

1490
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:21,450
really consult an actual lyme disease 
doctor on this.

1491
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:26,600
Not My area of expertise nor mine,
but I do have friends that have gotten 

1492
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:30,261
lyme disease and I know some people that
are suffering from it to this day that 

1493
01:12:30,261 --> 01:12:31,920
have like real,
real terrible issues with it.

1494
01:12:31,921 --> 01:12:34,230
My friend Jim Miller,
who's a fighter in the UFC,

1495
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:37,470
it's come and go with him and a terrible
way to affects,

1496
01:12:37,510 --> 01:12:39,960
greatly affects his joints and,
and you know,

1497
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:42,720
he's had to take various medications,
try to get a handle on it.

1498
01:12:42,750 --> 01:12:45,450
It depends,
I think on the person.

1499
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:46,920
There's a lot of,
a lot of variables.

1500
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:51,980
It depends on the person,
depends on how quickly they detect the 

1501
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:51,980
lyme disease.
Um,

1502
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:55,260
my friend brought his son to the doctor.
His son had lyme disease.

1503
01:12:55,261 --> 01:13:00,261
He brought us on to the doctor.
The doctor didn't believe he had lyme 

1504
01:13:00,261 --> 01:13:00,261
disease because that,
you know,

1505
01:13:00,261 --> 01:13:03,831
the.
The Bullseye ring around the fight had 

1506
01:13:03,831 --> 01:13:05,520
gone away,
which does sometimes happen.

1507
01:13:06,690 --> 01:13:07,770
They said,
Nah,

1508
01:13:07,771 --> 01:13:10,560
it's probably nothing,
and then the kid developed bell's Palsy.

1509
01:13:11,050 --> 01:13:11,850
Then they said,
okay,

1510
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:16,880
this is serious,
and then they realized that he actually 

1511
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:16,880
does have lyme disease and he was pretty
pissed.

1512
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:19,410
The doctor didn't take him seriously.
He had the lyme disease as well.

1513
01:13:19,590 --> 01:13:23,700
He had to go on some serious intravenous
antibiotics for months.

1514
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:27,010
It was like really heavy stuff.
So we did actually have lyme disease.

1515
01:13:27,011 --> 01:13:29,850
He had lyme disease and it devastated 
him for months.

1516
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,560
For months.
He wasn't the same.

1517
01:13:31,590 --> 01:13:36,590
I think a problem with a lot of these 
medical conditions is that the clinical 

1518
01:13:36,590 --> 01:13:39,951
diagnoses,
which means that the diagnosed not with 

1519
01:13:39,951 --> 01:13:43,010
tests,
that you can do a blood and things like 

1520
01:13:43,010 --> 01:13:43,010
that,
but it's based on the symptoms.

1521
01:13:43,010 --> 01:13:43,620
Yes.
A lot of the times people,

1522
01:13:43,621 --> 01:13:46,680
they,
they like to attribute their problems to

1523
01:13:46,740 --> 01:13:51,740
something and gave it a name.
So we've got a lot of things now like 

1524
01:13:51,740 --> 01:13:55,260
I'm a fibromyalgia a where we don't 
have,

1525
01:13:55,770 --> 01:13:59,730
we can't do a blood test usually for 
something like fibromyalgia.

1526
01:13:59,731 --> 01:14:01,200
He have elevated,
uh,

1527
01:14:01,710 --> 01:14:03,420
uh,
immune responses and things like that.

1528
01:14:03,421 --> 01:14:05,490
But you can't like Scifi show,
this is fibromyalgia.

1529
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,500
It could be just a symptom of something 
else.

1530
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:12,710
But people like to put a name on things.
So if people have the getting aches and 

1531
01:14:12,710 --> 01:14:12,710
pains

1532
01:14:12,710 --> 01:14:17,250
or wherever they say it's Fibromyalgia,
they convinced themselves as 

1533
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:18,740
fibromyalgia.
And with the self diagnosis,

1534
01:14:19,170 --> 01:14:21,580
with morgellons,
that happens a lot.

1535
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:27,240
People,
people get old and your joints start to 

1536
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:30,331
ache.
Your hair starts to fall out in your 

1537
01:14:30,331 --> 01:14:30,331
eyes,
start to,

1538
01:14:30,331 --> 01:14:31,210
you know,
you're losing your vision and your focus

1539
01:14:31,570 --> 01:14:36,570
and people think what's wrong with me?
And they don't realize they're just 

1540
01:14:36,570 --> 01:14:38,020
getting old and they,
they look it up and they think they have

1541
01:14:38,021 --> 01:14:40,870
morgellons or they think they have 
chronic lyme people just,

1542
01:14:40,871 --> 01:14:45,871
if they're getting ill for some reason,
they like to attribute the chronic 

1543
01:14:45,871 --> 01:14:50,520
condition to something.
So they might tag on to a particular 

1544
01:14:50,591 --> 01:14:52,270
thing like chronic lyme.
If something,

1545
01:14:52,330 --> 01:14:55,380
if they got bit by a tick,
uh,

1546
01:14:55,390 --> 01:14:59,200
like last summer and then this summer,
now they have all these problems.

1547
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:01,570
They might self diagnosed as having 
chronic lyme.

1548
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:06,700
It is possible,
but you do realize that there's a 

1549
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:08,501
tremendous amount of lyme disease in the
northeast and lyme disease is very real 

1550
01:15:08,501 --> 01:15:08,501
thing.
It's horrible,

1551
01:15:08,501 --> 01:15:10,790
horrible condition and the people that 
do get it,

1552
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:13,430
I mean they're pretty uniform and the 
fact that it sucks,

1553
01:15:13,940 --> 01:15:18,940
it's a terrible and it's really scary 
because it really didn't kind of exist 

1554
01:15:18,940 --> 01:15:19,040
just a few hundred years ago.
I mean,

1555
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:20,860
I don't know where it came from.
Yeah.

1556
01:15:20,930 --> 01:15:22,000
I just Kinda,
I don't know.

1557
01:15:22,130 --> 01:15:27,130
Or maybe they didn't know what it was.
People got it and no one had any idea 

1558
01:15:27,130 --> 01:15:27,130
what it was.
Yeah.

1559
01:15:27,130 --> 01:15:29,650
It could be.
It was discovered that village lime,

1560
01:15:30,470 --> 01:15:35,220
which named after [inaudible] reminds me
of the Cuban embassy thing with a song.

1561
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:36,830
Anyway,
what do you think about that thing?

1562
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:37,140
I think

1563
01:15:37,940 --> 01:15:40,440
I don't think it's there is any signing 
a weapon.

1564
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:43,620
Why do you think that I.
because the,

1565
01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:48,830
it's the same type of thing.
People are reporting a bunch of 

1566
01:15:48,830 --> 01:15:51,441
symptoms.
They haven't really done any direct 

1567
01:15:51,441 --> 01:15:53,760
physical diagnosis of people.
People were getting ill,

1568
01:15:53,790 --> 01:15:55,830
people were reporting,
hearing noises,

1569
01:15:56,370 --> 01:16:01,370
uh,
but the noise is kind of sound like 

1570
01:16:01,370 --> 01:16:01,550
cicadas.
Uh,

1571
01:16:01,551 --> 01:16:04,290
and so it could have been like one guy,
whites live in the middle of the night.

1572
01:16:04,291 --> 01:16:06,870
This is the gator in his room,
jumps out of bed,

1573
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:08,220
scared.
He goes quiet.

1574
01:16:08,490 --> 01:16:11,340
And have you ever tried tracking as a 
caterer in your yard?

1575
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:13,470
And you get close to them and they go 
quiet.

1576
01:16:13,471 --> 01:16:15,750
So you gotta start moving.
It gets back into bed,

1577
01:16:15,930 --> 01:16:17,190
skate assaults,
buzzing again.

1578
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:22,490
So this time was the one guy say he 
tells this story to someone or he gets a

1579
01:16:22,531 --> 01:16:27,531
little lighter,
some unrelated thing and other people 

1580
01:16:27,531 --> 01:16:27,531
say like,
you know,

1581
01:16:27,531 --> 01:16:28,200
well,
I don't feel very well either.

1582
01:16:28,201 --> 01:16:29,330
And then,
uh,

1583
01:16:29,331 --> 01:16:34,331
at some point people sign up,
make a false connection and they start 

1584
01:16:34,331 --> 01:16:35,640
thinking that something actually 
happened.

1585
01:16:36,030 --> 01:16:38,610
And so they start asking people how you 
feeling?

1586
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:39,600
You feeling?
All right,

1587
01:16:39,690 --> 01:16:41,250
how's your hearing?
And people say,

1588
01:16:41,251 --> 01:16:41,640
well,
I'm here.

1589
01:16:41,641 --> 01:16:46,641
He's not as good as it used to be.
My eyesight's not as good as it used to 

1590
01:16:46,641 --> 01:16:46,641
baby.
And having these balance problems,

1591
01:16:46,641 --> 01:16:49,740
but it's just people just having normal 
normal life problems.

1592
01:16:49,741 --> 01:16:52,740
They're getting old or the near the 
through sickness.

1593
01:16:52,741 --> 01:16:54,480
So they've moved,
moved away,

1594
01:16:55,140 --> 01:17:00,140
pull up,
pull up evidence of sonic weapon in 

1595
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:01,800
Cuba.
Because I don't,

1596
01:17:01,860 --> 01:17:06,860
I don't agree with you on this one.
The U s releases recordings of sonic 

1597
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:08,160
weapon attack used against diplomats in 
Cuba.

1598
01:17:08,161 --> 01:17:08,820
Play this.

1599
01:17:11,380 --> 01:17:13,920
Sorry.

1600
01:17:14,430 --> 01:17:15,780
Bit like a skater to me.

1601
01:17:16,130 --> 01:17:21,130
Yes sir.

1602
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:27,800
At least 22 people have been hurt by the
mysterious high pitch sound.

1603
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:32,860
Have they have like 22 people are sick.
They're talk to their doctors and they 

1604
01:17:32,860 --> 01:17:36,890
told them about the symptoms of people 
with brain damage.

1605
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:42,040
But it's a clinical diagnosis,
but you know that they have sonic 

1606
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:42,040
weapons,
right?

1607
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:43,460
Yeah.
Have weapons or something that have been

1608
01:17:43,730 --> 01:17:48,730
researched and surreal in you don't 
think it's entirely possible that this 

1609
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:51,620
is a sonic weapon.
I don't see any evidence.

1610
01:17:51,670 --> 01:17:53,420
There's,
have you looked into this a lot?

1611
01:17:53,490 --> 01:17:54,130
Yeah.
Yeah.

1612
01:17:54,850 --> 01:17:59,850
Um,
it seems to me that if they're 

1613
01:17:59,850 --> 01:18:02,440
broadcasting it,
and this is something that the 

1614
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:05,920
government is talking about,
they're investigating and all these 

1615
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:08,261
different people are investigating it.
It seems like there's enough evidence 

1616
01:18:08,261 --> 01:18:09,680
that are concerned if everyone's 
reporting different things,

1617
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:13,670
stressful conditions,
different weapon.

1618
01:18:13,890 --> 01:18:18,890
Second US deployments.
Cuba panel asserts Gabby can listen my 

1619
01:18:20,230 --> 01:18:21,030
thing there,
right?

1620
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:22,390
I Cuba like,
yeah,

1621
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:27,760
they've got an interest in figuring it 
out because they didn't want to get the 

1622
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:27,760
finger.
Yeah,

1623
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:30,110
of course.
It's probably not Cuba doing it.

1624
01:18:30,111 --> 01:18:35,111
If it was somebody that will do this 
after a nine month probe hampered by a 

1625
01:18:35,111 --> 01:18:37,910
lack of success,
a lack of access to medical records.

1626
01:18:37,911 --> 01:18:42,911
A panel of Cuban scientists today 
declared US diplomats here likely 

1627
01:18:42,911 --> 01:18:46,751
suffered a collective psycho,
sympathetic psychogenic psychogenic 

1628
01:18:46,910 --> 01:18:50,000
disorder.
Not Deliberate how fast.

1629
01:18:50,001 --> 01:18:54,380
Hysteria essentially.
So see if what evidence there is that is

1630
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:57,620
pro this.
I typed in evidence and assist it.

1631
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:59,360
This is what came up.
Yeah,

1632
01:18:59,460 --> 01:19:04,460
is the latest thing is.
But see if there's any other articles 

1633
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:08,560
contradict.
There is a later thing and then this 

1634
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:11,141
word has been.
They say the detective changes in the 

1635
01:19:11,141 --> 01:19:14,561
white matter of the brain up some people
which is a bit vague and they did white 

1636
01:19:14,601 --> 01:19:15,410
matter of the brain.

1637
01:19:15,790 --> 01:19:18,100
They using the Fmr.
What do they use them to find?

1638
01:19:18,101 --> 01:19:19,190
The.
I don't know how they did it,

1639
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:21,720
but I can't even figure out cte and 
players,

1640
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:26,900
but who knows what caused this and how 
many people actually habit and you know,

1641
01:19:26,901 --> 01:19:30,170
if one guy has changes in the white 
matter of his brain,

1642
01:19:30,171 --> 01:19:34,520
who knows what that's actually due to 
dot treating victims and the cat attack,

1643
01:19:34,521 --> 01:19:39,521
though I've found visible,
perceptible damage to the patients' 

1644
01:19:39,521 --> 01:19:43,001
brains.
Marking the first solid evidence that's 

1645
01:19:43,001 --> 01:19:44,810
sophisticated weapon described by 
embassy staff is entirely real.

1646
01:19:44,811 --> 01:19:48,830
The associate Associated Press reports 
says the Associated Press based on what?

1647
01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:50,630
Based on someone at the State Department
saying,

1648
01:19:50,631 --> 01:19:52,000
we're found,
uh,

1649
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:54,590
some damage somewhere.
You know,

1650
01:19:54,591 --> 01:19:56,060
the State Department is covering their 
ass.

1651
01:19:56,061 --> 01:20:00,140
The State Department expelled Cuban 
diplomat because of this.

1652
01:20:00,870 --> 01:20:02,750
They did.
Meanwhile,

1653
01:20:02,751 --> 01:20:04,010
the Cuba.
That's our mine.

1654
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:06,190
We did nothing.
We did nothing.

1655
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:08,820
Go back up there please,
because Rebecca at the top,

1656
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:12,060
they took some Americans away from the 
embassy because they were sick.

1657
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:15,850
And so they said the Cubans didn't 
protect the American as well.

1658
01:20:15,851 --> 01:20:20,851
He know.
So you're going to have to send six 

1659
01:20:20,851 --> 01:20:20,851
people back as well.
See,

1660
01:20:20,851 --> 01:20:21,890
it says the State Department,
the FBI officials.

1661
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:25,850
Uh Oh.
It's so unlike anything,

1662
01:20:25,851 --> 01:20:30,851
the State Department,
the FBI officials I've ever seen that 

1663
01:20:30,851 --> 01:20:34,001
the Cuban government's claim,
the high pitched worrying sounds 

1664
01:20:34,001 --> 01:20:34,850
reported by the US embassy staff are 
just cicadas.

1665
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:40,240
Seems almost plausible.
Click on that link that says they're 

1666
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:40,240
just cicadas up at the top.
That,

1667
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:41,750
but the same one we just saw her,
I think.

1668
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:42,740
Is that it?
Yeah.

1669
01:20:43,460 --> 01:20:44,810
Yeah.
Playing the noise.

1670
01:20:47,070 --> 01:20:52,070
Hm.
This is a similar attack happen to 

1671
01:20:52,070 --> 01:20:52,070
somebody else in Uzbekistan.
Is that Bush?

1672
01:20:52,070 --> 01:20:52,070
Oh really?
Yeah.

1673
01:20:52,070 --> 01:20:56,950
Old School Bush.
Why they have a picture of is being 

1674
01:20:56,950 --> 01:20:56,950
attacked by us again.
Okay.

1675
01:20:56,950 --> 01:20:57,180
Yeah,
I did it all.

1676
01:20:58,530 --> 01:21:01,230
Yeah,
I'm too weird sound for sure.

1677
01:21:01,470 --> 01:21:04,740
But I would think that um,
something that would be,

1678
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:05,810
uh,
that you,

1679
01:21:05,910 --> 01:21:08,910
that could damage you would be a 
frequency.

1680
01:21:08,911 --> 01:21:11,850
That would be audible.
Yeah.

1681
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:14,220
Well some of them reported hearing 
things,

1682
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:15,750
but you know,
people,

1683
01:21:15,780 --> 01:21:17,610
some people didn't report hearing 
things.

1684
01:21:17,611 --> 01:21:20,370
Some people had a high pitch whine that 
disappeared.

1685
01:21:20,371 --> 01:21:23,040
Some people had a long lasting rumbling 
noise.

1686
01:21:24,330 --> 01:21:29,330
Some people might not be.
Sonic vision changes all kinds of 

1687
01:21:29,330 --> 01:21:29,330
different,
you know,

1688
01:21:29,330 --> 01:21:32,070
just your regular morgellons common 
chronic fatigue.

1689
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:34,570
Getting old type symptoms.
Hm.

1690
01:21:35,610 --> 01:21:39,240
So you think that someone started 
talking about this being an issue,

1691
01:21:39,241 --> 01:21:41,280
that they're being attacked and 
everybody started freaking out?

1692
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:42,450
Yeah,
that's possible.

1693
01:21:42,510 --> 01:21:47,510
Yeah,
and I think probably something happened 

1694
01:21:47,510 --> 01:21:49,191
like the esm guy heard something and 
jumped out of bed and it stopped and 

1695
01:21:49,191 --> 01:21:52,461
then got back into bed and it started 
again and someone else had something 

1696
01:21:52,461 --> 01:21:55,140
similar happened.
That's funny because if you were in Cuba

1697
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:58,500
and they didn't want you there and you 
heard weird noises like goddammit,

1698
01:21:58,620 --> 01:22:01,710
they're attacking me with a sound ray 
and people are being.

1699
01:22:02,070 --> 01:22:07,070
People are being harassed in Cuba.
Like if you work at the American 

1700
01:22:07,070 --> 01:22:07,070
embassy,
you get harassed.

1701
01:22:07,070 --> 01:22:10,560
New Sonic attack against American 
diplomat suggest Russian involvement.

1702
01:22:10,620 --> 01:22:12,120
Palm Palm,
Palm.

1703
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:14,910
The Russians did it through twitter 
bots.

1704
01:22:16,410 --> 01:22:21,390
When you click on the twitter bots,
they send sound through your earbuds.

1705
01:22:21,470 --> 01:22:23,070
Yeah.
People are saying like,

1706
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:24,810
you know,
linking the CICADAS,

1707
01:22:24,811 --> 01:22:27,570
causing the hearing loss.
But no one's actually saying the CICADAS

1708
01:22:27,660 --> 01:22:29,370
are causing people to lose their 
hearing.

1709
01:22:29,910 --> 01:22:31,240
They just saying that,
you know,

1710
01:22:31,590 --> 01:22:36,590
people sometimes get reductions in their
hearing as they get older and maybe 

1711
01:22:36,590 --> 01:22:39,270
they're noticing it because they're 
focusing on it so much.

1712
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:41,130
Right.
That's why those diseases,

1713
01:22:41,131 --> 01:22:43,620
people think I'm sick and then they 
focus on something.

1714
01:22:43,621 --> 01:22:48,621
Like if you feel like you're itching a 
bit and you think you've got some kind 

1715
01:22:48,621 --> 01:22:50,850
of weird pathogen under your skin,
you just gonna itch more and more,

1716
01:22:50,851 --> 01:22:52,350
you're going to feel more and more 
itching.

1717
01:22:52,710 --> 01:22:57,710
Right.
So if people weren't really paying 

1718
01:22:57,710 --> 01:22:57,710
attention,
like I have like mild tinnitus,

1719
01:22:57,710 --> 01:22:59,910
ringing in the ears from video games or 
something,

1720
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:02,700
I dunno.
Headphones they said yeah,

1721
01:23:02,701 --> 01:23:03,720
it could be.
But you know,

1722
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:05,890
people get tested,
get older for no reason.

1723
01:23:05,891 --> 01:23:08,560
Some people you're going to loud 
concerts or whatever.

1724
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:11,760
Most of the time I don't even think 
about it in my.

1725
01:23:11,950 --> 01:23:16,600
I might have never even noticed it,
but if I stopped and listened to my,

1726
01:23:16,770 --> 01:23:18,100
you know,
what's going on in my ears,

1727
01:23:18,101 --> 01:23:21,820
I can hear this tonight is the noise in 
my ear very,

1728
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:22,930
very quietly.

1729
01:23:23,590 --> 01:23:24,880
So if someone said,
oh,

1730
01:23:24,881 --> 01:23:27,930
I think we're being bombarded by sonic 
weapons like a.

1731
01:23:28,030 --> 01:23:30,430
can you hear any ringing in your ear or 
anything like that?

1732
01:23:30,431 --> 01:23:34,090
And then you go quiet and you listen and
you start noticing these things.

1733
01:23:35,330 --> 01:23:37,300
Right.
That makes sense.

1734
01:23:37,930 --> 01:23:40,510
Do people are very susceptible,
you know,

1735
01:23:40,930 --> 01:23:43,430
psychosomatic illnesses,
they're absolutely very real.

1736
01:23:43,460 --> 01:23:44,710
And this,
there's a thing called sick,

1737
01:23:45,310 --> 01:23:47,800
sick building syndrome,
uh,

1738
01:23:47,801 --> 01:23:52,090
which is possibly a real thing and 
possibly a psychogenic thing,

1739
01:23:52,091 --> 01:23:55,210
but a lot of people think that a sick 
building syndrome,

1740
01:23:55,630 --> 01:23:57,720
a lot of the times when it happens,
it's like when you.

1741
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:01,270
Lots of people working in the same place
get similar symptoms,

1742
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:04,240
it's happening because of this mass 
psychogenic illness.

1743
01:24:04,241 --> 01:24:08,170
One person says,
I feel sick and everyone kind of assumes

1744
01:24:08,171 --> 01:24:11,140
it's something in the environment around
them that's causing that.

1745
01:24:11,410 --> 01:24:13,090
And so they kind of feel sick as well.

1746
01:24:13,420 --> 01:24:18,420
This a disease.
And I had heard of someone's talking 

1747
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:18,730
about this one's called Allah phrenia I 
believe,

1748
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:23,620
and that it's when people go to visit 
people who have schizophrenia,

1749
01:24:23,860 --> 01:24:25,630
when they,
if they hang out with those people,

1750
01:24:25,631 --> 01:24:29,200
they start developing very bizarre 
behavior of their own.

1751
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:33,010
And sometimes they have to be monitored.
And that's kind of weird.

1752
01:24:33,250 --> 01:24:34,360
Yeah,
that sounds well.

1753
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:39,840
We all know that some people are way 
more susceptible to suggestion way more 

1754
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:41,980
susceptible to him.
Have you ever been hypnotized?

1755
01:24:41,981 --> 01:24:42,580
Now?
I haven't.

1756
01:24:42,670 --> 01:24:43,690
I have.
It's fascinating.

1757
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:44,230
Yeah,
I,

1758
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:49,280
I,
I feel like I wouldn't be hypnotizable 

1759
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:50,710
saying that everybody thinks that I 
thought that too,

1760
01:24:50,740 --> 01:24:53,530
but I did it with a friend.
My friend Vinny shoreman did it to me,

1761
01:24:53,531 --> 01:24:57,760
so I trusted him and I just let it and 
he's a registered licensed hypnotist and

1762
01:24:57,761 --> 01:25:02,761
he works with a lot of athletes,
a lot of fighters in particular and 

1763
01:25:02,761 --> 01:25:04,630
basically just puts you in a very 
bizarre state of mind,

1764
01:25:04,631 --> 01:25:06,310
but you're aware of it the whole time.

1765
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:10,210
It's not like some mentoring candidate 
thing where they're going to wake up mic

1766
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:15,960
now you're an assassin for the 
government and you'll run out the door 

1767
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:15,960
and your underwear like captain 
underpants.

1768
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:17,170
Do you know captain underpants says,
do you have kids?

1769
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:18,730
No,
but I do know her.

1770
01:25:19,660 --> 01:25:21,640
Yeah.
My kids love captain underpants.

1771
01:25:21,641 --> 01:25:24,130
Friend of mine told me I should try 
hypnotizing my wife.

1772
01:25:25,630 --> 01:25:29,710
He didn't specify exactly the way he,
uh,

1773
01:25:29,740 --> 01:25:34,740
he keeps his relationship going is by 
hypnotizes them every couple of nights.

1774
01:25:34,931 --> 01:25:37,340
He hypnotizes his wife and just,
uh,

1775
01:25:37,630 --> 01:25:39,130
I don't know.
I didn't know exactly what happens.

1776
01:25:39,131 --> 01:25:40,450
He's actually,
he didn't really specify,

1777
01:25:40,451 --> 01:25:45,451
but he,
he highly recommended humanizing my 

1778
01:25:45,451 --> 01:25:45,451
wife.
Wow.

1779
01:25:45,451 --> 01:25:48,781
That guy sounds like a creep.
He's doing some weird shit to his wife 

1780
01:25:48,781 --> 01:25:49,090
who's a nice guy,
but maybe not when he's got that,

1781
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:52,550
that stopwatch hanging on a string.
Why was,

1782
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:53,380
it was always a watch.

1783
01:25:53,380 --> 01:25:54,430
Right?
Follow the watch.

1784
01:25:54,700 --> 01:25:56,500
Very.
You're kidding.

1785
01:25:56,501 --> 01:25:58,210
TRIPI.
Yeah.

1786
01:25:58,211 --> 01:26:00,850
Um,
that's real hypnosis.

1787
01:26:00,870 --> 01:26:02,380
Israel.
I was wondering,

1788
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:02,960
I was like,
oh.

1789
01:26:03,530 --> 01:26:04,670
I was like,
what is this like?

1790
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:06,350
Is it the bullshit?
But they,

1791
01:26:06,390 --> 01:26:11,050
it really does put you in a very unusual
state and when you get out of it there,

1792
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:16,160
you know,
you can go through a lot of stuff that 

1793
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:18,101
you have like maybe cluttering around 
inside your mind and reorganize after a 

1794
01:26:18,101 --> 01:26:19,010
hypnotic session.
It's pretty interesting.

1795
01:26:19,790 --> 01:26:21,230
It's a reason why people use it for 
like,

1796
01:26:21,930 --> 01:26:26,930
you know,
quitting smoking and things on those 

1797
01:26:26,930 --> 01:26:26,930
lines.
Yeah.

1798
01:26:26,930 --> 01:26:30,551
Well,
this just shows how malleable the human 

1799
01:26:30,551 --> 01:26:30,551
brain is.
Yeah.

1800
01:26:30,551 --> 01:26:30,551
Uh,
and you know,

1801
01:26:30,551 --> 01:26:32,150
it goes back to that whole thing with 
being brainwashed by youtube,

1802
01:26:32,570 --> 01:26:34,860
you know,
people make documentaries,

1803
01:26:35,390 --> 01:26:37,190
uh,
in a way to hypnotize people.

1804
01:26:37,710 --> 01:26:38,490
They,
they,

1805
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:43,960
they structure it in a way that you get 
these images coming at you and these 

1806
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:47,891
ideas and they slaves reinforcement of 
things in a way that will actually just 

1807
01:26:48,410 --> 01:26:53,000
kind of embed this idea in your brain 
without you even really realizing it.

1808
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:58,240
Yeah.
They'll say things like you are being 

1809
01:26:58,240 --> 01:26:58,240
lied to.
And with the,

1810
01:26:58,240 --> 01:27:01,530
the thing that kills me too is that they
use oftentimes a hypnotic voice like 

1811
01:27:01,530 --> 01:27:01,880
that.
Eric Do,

1812
01:27:01,881 --> 01:27:06,170
big Iowa does those flat earth videos.
He talks in a very hypnotic manner.

1813
01:27:06,290 --> 01:27:09,880
It's like very calm and yeah,
I think so.

1814
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:14,900
The nine slash 11 videos as well.
This nice woman dictating it behind the 

1815
01:27:16,011 --> 01:27:18,860
buildings could not possibly a fall in 
the way they did.

1816
01:27:19,070 --> 01:27:21,120
Physics proves it.
Uh,

1817
01:27:21,170 --> 01:27:23,540
it looks like we're going to have eric 
do bay.

1818
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:26,990
He said he's agreed to do it.
Talk with Neil degrasse Tyson.

1819
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:33,500
We're going to,
he's going to skype in from Thailand or 

1820
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:33,920
wherever the fuck he is.
Yeah,

1821
01:27:34,010 --> 01:27:36,470
I think it's in Thailand.
I don't know how he gets there with flat

1822
01:27:36,471 --> 01:27:37,500
earth.
How'd you get here?

1823
01:27:37,790 --> 01:27:40,910
That's still in the northern hemisphere.
I think Thailand scoop over there.

1824
01:27:41,210 --> 01:27:42,830
Shoot over there and avoid the ice wall.

1825
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:46,970
But he doesn't believe in dinosaurs 
either.

1826
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:50,150
It's kind of a crazy guy.
No Way.

1827
01:27:50,151 --> 01:27:55,151
You think he doesn't believe in say,
I don't know if he believes in 

1828
01:27:55,151 --> 01:27:55,151
satellites,
but I don't think he believes in nuclear

1829
01:27:55,151 --> 01:27:57,350
bombs.
Antisemites as well.

1830
01:27:57,351 --> 01:27:58,840
I think it was him.
Yeah.

1831
01:28:00,180 --> 01:28:03,160
That's unfortunate.
Subculture in the movement of A.

1832
01:28:04,620 --> 01:28:06,830
Yeah.
Nazis type people.

1833
01:28:07,190 --> 01:28:12,190
Well,
because of the conspiracy theory goes 

1834
01:28:12,190 --> 01:28:12,190
back to,
you know,

1835
01:28:12,190 --> 01:28:14,600
the rothschilds running the world.
And so they think is these,

1836
01:28:14,601 --> 01:28:15,630
uh,
you know,

1837
01:28:15,650 --> 01:28:20,650
this certain sector of the Jewish race 
who weren't actually in control of 

1838
01:28:20,650 --> 01:28:24,071
everything.
And these are the people who were 

1839
01:28:24,071 --> 01:28:24,071
stopping you from the debate is not me 
saying this.

1840
01:28:24,071 --> 01:28:27,230
I have no knowledge whether or not 
you're anti-semite don't chicken out.

1841
01:28:28,420 --> 01:28:33,290
It's pretty easy to verify a bunch of 
videos explaining his position on it.

1842
01:28:33,390 --> 01:28:38,390
My favorite thing is that he's my friend
Eddie Bravo is kind of buying into some 

1843
01:28:38,390 --> 01:28:40,790
of his shit.
Witch tortures me to no end,

1844
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:44,690
but Eddie is one of the greatest Jujitsu
coaches on planet earth.

1845
01:28:44,790 --> 01:28:49,790
He's an amazing Jujitsu coach in Jujitsu
competitor and one of Eric [inaudible] 

1846
01:28:49,790 --> 01:28:52,670
biggest videos is about how Jujitsu is 
bullshit.

1847
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:58,100
It just shows you.
It does,

1848
01:28:58,101 --> 01:28:59,180
isn't it?
About that.

1849
01:28:59,181 --> 01:29:02,550
It's about wing Chung Kung Fu defeats 
Jujitsu,

1850
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:05,040
which is by the way,
not true.

1851
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:10,100
Don't try it unless you're like way 
bigger and the guy sucks that Hugh 

1852
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:14,390
Jitsu.
She those guys in a room together and 

1853
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:14,390
they can just fight it out.
I don't think so.

1854
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:16,170
They would just talk about conspiracies 
to the end of time.

1855
01:29:16,710 --> 01:29:19,410
Eddie loves conspiracies.
I would like to talk to Eddie.

1856
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:21,900
We can do that.
He's screaming,

1857
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:24,420
screaming.
Might have to get you some earplugs here

1858
01:29:24,421 --> 01:29:25,260
tonight.
I said kick him.

1859
01:29:25,290 --> 01:29:27,180
He's interesting because he knows so 
much about them all.

1860
01:29:27,270 --> 01:29:29,000
Oh man,
that's really interesting.

1861
01:29:29,180 --> 01:29:30,210
Confuses me.
I'm like,

1862
01:29:30,211 --> 01:29:33,360
how much time do you have?
Where do you have the time for this?

1863
01:29:33,390 --> 01:29:38,390
Yeah.
He's spouting off this advanced physics 

1864
01:29:38,390 --> 01:29:40,560
references like Mickelson areas,
failure and things like that.

1865
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:46,100
Those are the flat earth science 
experiments that supposedly proved the 

1866
01:29:46,100 --> 01:29:46,500
wasn't moving.

1867
01:29:46,950 --> 01:29:50,610
That one's hilarious to me because when 
I first brought it up to Eddie,

1868
01:29:50,850 --> 01:29:54,750
Jamie pulled this up and send it to me 
the other day that I first brought it up

1869
01:29:54,751 --> 01:29:57,630
to Eddie from like eight years ago on 
the podcast,

1870
01:29:57,631 --> 01:30:02,631
one of the really early podcast when we 
still did it in my house on a couch and 

1871
01:30:03,270 --> 01:30:08,270
he's like,
what's the most ridiculous conspiracy 

1872
01:30:08,270 --> 01:30:08,270
theory?
You're hurt?

1873
01:30:08,270 --> 01:30:08,270
And I said flat earth,
and he's like,

1874
01:30:08,270 --> 01:30:09,960
no,
people don't believe the earth is flat.

1875
01:30:10,620 --> 01:30:15,620
So he went from that to.
I don't think he's at 100 percent 

1876
01:30:15,620 --> 01:30:17,610
convinced that it's flat,
but he's definitely willing to listen.

1877
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:22,880
He's down the rabbit hole.
He got sacked and he loves it and it's 

1878
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:23,790
probably like a lot of it is just from 
him watching endless youtube.

1879
01:30:23,791 --> 01:30:25,650
It's 100 percent what it is.
Here it is right here.

1880
01:30:28,510 --> 01:30:30,810
The worst conspiracy to like the worst 
one,

1881
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:35,840
flat earth.
There's people that are flat to the 

1882
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:35,840
young earth.
That's another bad one.

1883
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:35,890
No,
no,

1884
01:30:35,891 --> 01:30:36,810
no.
Like today,

1885
01:30:36,811 --> 01:30:41,811
people don't believe that that's a big 
percentage of the Christian population 

1886
01:30:42,330 --> 01:30:47,330
dying.
I went with young earth there for some 

1887
01:30:47,330 --> 01:30:47,330
fucking stranger.
We were all baked.

1888
01:30:47,550 --> 01:30:50,160
Oh,
probably unfortunately.

1889
01:30:50,161 --> 01:30:52,890
But that was,
that was when he found out about flatter

1890
01:30:52,900 --> 01:30:54,690
for me.
And that was,

1891
01:30:54,750 --> 01:30:57,000
you started him down the rabbit thousand
episodes ago.

1892
01:30:57,780 --> 01:30:59,350
What episode was that?
Fifty four.

1893
01:30:59,430 --> 01:31:02,970
So that was probably 2010.
First year.

1894
01:31:03,140 --> 01:31:04,840
Yeah.
Yeah,

1895
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:07,920
it doesn't.
That was even big on the Internet by the

1896
01:31:07,980 --> 01:31:11,790
head of the curve.
Maybe responsible for this whole thing.

1897
01:31:14,070 --> 01:31:19,070
Well,
he and I used to watch ufo things 

1898
01:31:19,070 --> 01:31:19,070
forever,
but he got off a Ufo.

1899
01:31:19,070 --> 01:31:19,890
See,
he goes in waves,

1900
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:21,570
right?
Eddie goes in waves.

1901
01:31:21,750 --> 01:31:26,300
We were both like really into Ufos.
And in particular Zechariah situation,

1902
01:31:26,580 --> 01:31:28,100
that was the big one.
You know,

1903
01:31:28,110 --> 01:31:30,030
Zechariah stitching is,
I think you've talked about it,

1904
01:31:30,031 --> 01:31:35,031
unless the Sumerian text guy,
he wrote a the reason why a 10th planet 

1905
01:31:36,391 --> 01:31:40,530
Jiu Jitsu is June 10th planet Jiu Jitsu.
Um,

1906
01:31:40,770 --> 01:31:45,770
I actually came up with the name and one
of the reasons why I came up with the 

1907
01:31:45,770 --> 01:31:48,621
names because we were talking about 
Zechariah stitching and the idea is 

1908
01:31:48,621 --> 01:31:48,621
that,
um,

1909
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:51,450
this,
this came from another planet.

1910
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:56,370
We actually came up with the name before
Pluto had been changed from a,

1911
01:31:56,400 --> 01:32:00,310
you know,
they decided as a downgraded it.

1912
01:32:00,490 --> 01:32:05,490
So we decided that this Jujitsu was 
coming from another planet like out 

1913
01:32:05,490 --> 01:32:08,911
there where the Annunaki live,
but it was based on Zechariah Hitchen's 

1914
01:32:08,911 --> 01:32:08,950
book,
the Twelfth Planet.

1915
01:32:09,460 --> 01:32:14,460
And his book was all about Planet Nibiru
and that the Sumerian texts were when 

1916
01:32:17,051 --> 01:32:19,240
you,
when you decide for them correctly,

1917
01:32:19,241 --> 01:32:24,241
they all described this ancient race 
that came from this other planet that 

1918
01:32:24,241 --> 01:32:28,441
has this elliptical orbit that comes in 
between Earth and Mars and Jupiter 

1919
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:33,670
somewhere somewhere.
It comes near Earth every 3000,

1920
01:32:33,671 --> 01:32:38,671
600 years and that there's a group of 
beings called the Annunaki created human

1921
01:32:39,611 --> 01:32:44,611
beings by coming down here and taking 
them and taking lower primates and 

1922
01:32:46,121 --> 01:32:48,740
injecting their dna into them and blah,
blah,

1923
01:32:48,741 --> 01:32:49,180
blah.
We were,

1924
01:32:49,181 --> 01:32:51,430
we were balls deep into that.
That was a big one.

1925
01:32:51,590 --> 01:32:54,040
Yeah,
type thing like the ancient aliens,

1926
01:32:54,050 --> 01:32:57,760
there's something that's really at the 
far end of the conspiracy spectrum,

1927
01:32:58,210 --> 01:33:00,320
but you still get people who like,
you know,

1928
01:33:00,330 --> 01:33:01,750
chem trail,
believers who believe it.

1929
01:33:02,020 --> 01:33:05,380
One of the guys you interviewed a Scott 
Stevens.

1930
01:33:05,900 --> 01:33:07,090
There's a meteorologist.

1931
01:33:07,090 --> 01:33:07,930
Yes.
Yeah.

1932
01:33:07,931 --> 01:33:11,140
He was into like,
he believed chem trails 100 percent.

1933
01:33:11,141 --> 01:33:11,610
Yeah.
Yeah.

1934
01:33:11,620 --> 01:33:14,670
He also believes in aliens and they did 
it that type of hockey,

1935
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:17,740
like white holes and things disbelieve 
in aliens.

1936
01:33:17,980 --> 01:33:20,950
What I disbelieve is people that are in 
contact with them,

1937
01:33:20,980 --> 01:33:21,800
right?
Yeah.

1938
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:23,070
I think the idea of,
you know,

1939
01:33:23,110 --> 01:33:24,430
the Fermi Paradox,
right?

1940
01:33:24,750 --> 01:33:29,750
The idea that there's so many planets,
so many galaxies and so many solar 

1941
01:33:29,750 --> 01:33:32,620
systems that the odds of life being out 
there so high.

1942
01:33:32,621 --> 01:33:34,750
Why,
why have we not been contacted?

1943
01:33:34,990 --> 01:33:36,760
That's interesting to me.
Um,

1944
01:33:36,850 --> 01:33:39,310
it is entirely possible in my 
estimation,

1945
01:33:39,311 --> 01:33:44,311
as a moron,
that we are the most advanced life form 

1946
01:33:44,311 --> 01:33:48,060
in the universe.
It's entirely possible because we exist 

1947
01:33:48,060 --> 01:33:49,030
because we are the most advanced life 
form on earth.

1948
01:33:50,110 --> 01:33:51,370
We know that,
right?

1949
01:33:51,371 --> 01:33:54,010
As far as we know,
as far as like communicating things that

1950
01:33:54,011 --> 01:33:56,680
we've discovered in 2017,
we are the most advanced.

1951
01:33:56,890 --> 01:33:59,110
It's entirely possible that were the 
most advanced everywhere.

1952
01:33:59,111 --> 01:34:00,970
So I want.
It has to be right.

1953
01:34:01,700 --> 01:34:02,600
It could be us,
me,

1954
01:34:02,660 --> 01:34:03,770
yeah.
People say like,

1955
01:34:03,780 --> 01:34:05,270
you know what are the odds,
but you know,

1956
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:07,360
what are the odds of us?
The first person,

1957
01:34:07,690 --> 01:34:12,690
you know,
whoever wins the lottery because by the 

1958
01:34:12,690 --> 01:34:12,690
Alex,
but he happened to that person.

1959
01:34:12,690 --> 01:34:16,310
It doesn't mean that it's very unlikely.
It's not like we're running lots of 

1960
01:34:16,310 --> 01:34:18,781
universities and see what happens was 
also there's a direct one progression 

1961
01:34:18,781 --> 01:34:22,291
that you could follow.
Like what are the odds of someone 

1962
01:34:22,291 --> 01:34:22,930
inventing the iphone 10 and 2017.
Well,

1963
01:34:23,170 --> 01:34:25,290
I don't know what that's how long it 
took.

1964
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:27,700
That's what happened.
That is exactly what happened.

1965
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:31,330
This is what we track it.
We can go back to the iphone 1:10

1966
01:34:31,331 --> 01:34:32,350
years ago.
It's real simple.

1967
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:34,480
People.
People use the argument.

1968
01:34:34,490 --> 01:34:36,490
It's like what is the probability,
right?

1969
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:38,050
In weird ways.
Like people say,

1970
01:34:38,051 --> 01:34:43,051
what is the profitability of three 
planes falling from two free free 

1971
01:34:43,051 --> 01:34:44,710
buildings falling two planes hitting 
them,

1972
01:34:45,340 --> 01:34:46,940
because if that argument actually makes 
any sense.

1973
01:34:47,010 --> 01:34:48,200
Shitty argument.
Yeah.

1974
01:34:48,730 --> 01:34:49,960
They bring it up all the time.
It's like,

1975
01:34:49,961 --> 01:34:54,961
what are the odds you who get so lucky 
that you would have three planes pre 

1976
01:34:54,961 --> 01:34:56,950
buildings on the same day.
This doesn't make any sense.

1977
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:57,620
No,
it doesn't,

1978
01:34:57,650 --> 01:34:58,230
but people

1979
01:34:58,240 --> 01:35:00,110
don't say things like the end,
but again,

1980
01:35:00,170 --> 01:35:02,360
again,
it's to support confirmation bias,

1981
01:35:02,660 --> 01:35:07,660
so I think that it's entirely possible 
that we the only advanced life form in 

1982
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:12,011
the universe or it's entirely possible 
that they are incredibly advanced 

1983
01:35:12,011 --> 01:35:14,000
lifeforms that really aren't interested 
in us and quarantined.

1984
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:19,080
Yeah.
That's possible to look at our fucking 

1985
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:20,480
president and we have a wacky president 
that's just lies all the time.

1986
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:25,920
I mean fucking mind.
I think the purpose was studied 

1987
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:26,950
crunching as a bit a bit earlier,
but what would you see?

1988
01:35:27,020 --> 01:35:32,020
What you would go.
These people don't know what the fuck 

1989
01:35:32,020 --> 01:35:33,461
they're doing.
We need to figure out if they're going 

1990
01:35:33,461 --> 01:35:34,250
to blow each other up and pay close 
attention to them.

1991
01:35:34,251 --> 01:35:37,430
See if they don't poison their water,
like figure out what they're going to do

1992
01:35:37,431 --> 01:35:40,640
first before we give them new technology
or anything.

1993
01:35:40,670 --> 01:35:41,900
You okay with people?

1994
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:44,210
If this thing's out there?
It's probably machines.

1995
01:35:44,770 --> 01:35:47,150
Well,
I think it's.

1996
01:35:47,210 --> 01:35:51,140
You look at the advances in ai and stuff
that's going on now.

1997
01:35:51,790 --> 01:35:56,790
I don't think there's many civilizations
can really survive sync.

1998
01:35:57,531 --> 01:36:00,140
Biological life has its time.
Yeah,

1999
01:36:00,170 --> 01:36:05,170
because you know,
people talk about lighting a terminator 

2000
01:36:05,170 --> 01:36:09,851
and skynet and things like that and the 
robots taking over and I think that's 

2001
01:36:09,851 --> 01:36:11,850
actually a real problem.
I think we.

2002
01:36:11,940 --> 01:36:14,360
You seem like these robots.
Oh yeah,

2003
01:36:14,390 --> 01:36:15,890
yeah.
They're pretty crappy now,

2004
01:36:15,891 --> 01:36:20,891
but yet got to the stage where they can 
do back flips and things and it's not 

2005
01:36:20,891 --> 01:36:25,490
too much further along the line like a 
hundred years from now.

2006
01:36:25,491 --> 01:36:30,491
It's like a blink at the universities.
I will have robots that can do 

2007
01:36:30,491 --> 01:36:34,211
everything that humans can do and more 
absolutely indistinguishable to from 

2008
01:36:34,370 --> 01:36:38,690
from people and how you choose to be and
but not just any distinguishable.

2009
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:41,380
They will be humans.
Plus they'll be like gods.

2010
01:36:41,470 --> 01:36:42,420
Yeah,
they will.

2011
01:36:42,460 --> 01:36:47,460
We do hundreds,
thousands or millions of times more 

2012
01:36:47,460 --> 01:36:49,950
powerful than humans in terms of the 
processing power and news,

2013
01:36:49,970 --> 01:36:54,970
hundreds of times more powerful in terms
of their strength and that's 100 years 

2014
01:36:54,970 --> 01:36:54,970
from now.
Yeah.

2015
01:36:54,970 --> 01:36:55,340
We're really close to that.
Yeah,

2016
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:56,810
because it's going to be an explosive 
thing.

2017
01:36:56,860 --> 01:36:58,870
This,
this thing in ai now cold.

2018
01:36:58,871 --> 01:37:00,600
Um,
uh.

2019
01:37:01,940 --> 01:37:03,280
Oh.
Alrighty Dan,

2020
01:37:03,290 --> 01:37:08,290
because I forgot.
It was a generative adaptive networks 

2021
01:37:08,290 --> 01:37:11,170
which has this way of doing ai where the
robots basically basically teach 

2022
01:37:11,170 --> 01:37:15,251
themselves.
They have one robot who is judging 

2023
01:37:15,251 --> 01:37:18,521
things and there's a robot that's 
creating things and the robot that's 

2024
01:37:18,521 --> 01:37:21,350
creating things teaches the robot that's
judging things,

2025
01:37:21,351 --> 01:37:23,240
how to judge and the robots,
the judging things,

2026
01:37:23,241 --> 01:37:28,241
teachers,
the creating robots how to create and 

2027
01:37:28,241 --> 01:37:28,241
then they just go back and forth,
back and forth.

2028
01:37:28,241 --> 01:37:31,360
So the old way of doing ai was like you 
would teach a robot to do things and you

2029
01:37:31,380 --> 01:37:33,620
correct it when it goes wrong and you 
tweak the algorithm,

2030
01:37:34,070 --> 01:37:36,470
but now you've got these robots that are
learning things incredibly,

2031
01:37:36,530 --> 01:37:39,410
incredibly rapidly by teaching 
themselves how to do things.

2032
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:44,860
And the humans who are running these 
robots don't actually understand how 

2033
01:37:44,860 --> 01:37:49,481
this actually works.
You end up with this huge big matrix of 

2034
01:37:49,481 --> 01:37:51,110
numbers which,
you know,

2035
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:56,200
no one can actually decipher,
but the results come out of it that 

2036
01:37:56,200 --> 01:37:56,200
they've got things like now where

2037
01:37:56,200 --> 01:37:57,100
you can,
uh,

2038
01:37:57,720 --> 01:38:02,720
you can take a scene in a video and you 
can turn night into day or you can turn 

2039
01:38:02,720 --> 01:38:05,160
a snow scene into a summer season 
because they can,

2040
01:38:05,220 --> 01:38:10,220
you know,
the robots and the ai knows how to do 

2041
01:38:10,220 --> 01:38:10,220
these things.
And this is just the tip of the iceberg.

2042
01:38:10,220 --> 01:38:11,850
There's so much more coming down the 
line.

2043
01:38:12,180 --> 01:38:12,770
Yeah.
I,

2044
01:38:12,830 --> 01:38:14,880
I saw something that was incredibly 
disturbing.

2045
01:38:14,881 --> 01:38:18,570
They said that when robots become 
sentient,

2046
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:22,560
like when they have the ability to make 
up their own decisions and do things for

2047
01:38:22,561 --> 01:38:27,561
themselves and they first thing they're 
going to do is improve upon their own 

2048
01:38:27,561 --> 01:38:27,840
design.
Yeah.

2049
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:31,800
And they'll,
they'll will be able to have 10,000

2050
01:38:31,801 --> 01:38:34,530
years of human propel.
Like if,

2051
01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:39,600
if humans were evolving technology,
a robot or a sentient ai could do 10,000

2052
01:38:42,151 --> 01:38:45,030
years worth of technological advancement
in two weeks.

2053
01:38:45,090 --> 01:38:47,580
Yeah.
And is that real?

2054
01:38:47,740 --> 01:38:52,740
Yeah,
because computers just run so much 

2055
01:38:52,740 --> 01:38:54,090
faster.
Just think about that number two weeks.

2056
01:38:54,120 --> 01:38:56,520
So think about how long ago,
10,000

2057
01:38:56,521 --> 01:39:00,210
years ago was for civilization.
That is probably a little bit optimistic

2058
01:39:00,211 --> 01:39:05,211
in terms of like actual physical 
development because they can't make 

2059
01:39:05,211 --> 01:39:05,440
prototypes fast enough to try the out 
with.

2060
01:39:05,460 --> 01:39:06,240
Again.
They don't sleep.

2061
01:39:07,140 --> 01:39:08,700
They will.
They'll have these little robots.

2062
01:39:08,701 --> 01:39:11,610
Then the enemy fuck robots can move so 
much faster.

2063
01:39:11,970 --> 01:39:12,950
We do kill them.

2064
01:39:15,050 --> 01:39:16,670
Pioneer.
So scientists acts.

2065
01:39:16,830 --> 01:39:18,890
Some scientists are saying that we 
should actually not.

2066
01:39:18,990 --> 01:39:21,390
We should put the brakes on this Ai.
A lot of them,

2067
01:39:21,391 --> 01:39:22,050
right?
Yeah.

2068
01:39:22,180 --> 01:39:27,180
But it's funny thing that seems like 
we're moving towards the edge of the 

2069
01:39:27,180 --> 01:39:27,180
cliff and everyone's going,
hey,

2070
01:39:27,180 --> 01:39:31,731
we should probably hit the brakes.
It's also such a lucrative thing for 

2071
01:39:31,731 --> 01:39:32,080
people to do because if you get really 
good ai you can.

2072
01:39:32,130 --> 01:39:33,340
You can sell it.
Yeah.

2073
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:36,150
And the army is going to want robot 
soldiers.

2074
01:39:36,930 --> 01:39:37,740
Yeah.
You've got these,

2075
01:39:37,741 --> 01:39:40,050
these,
these drones with guns mounted on them.

2076
01:39:41,210 --> 01:39:43,590
If you imagine you've got like you.
That scares the shit out man.

2077
01:39:43,591 --> 01:39:45,900
What are you showing me?
This I'm going to hit play.

2078
01:39:45,901 --> 01:39:50,130
It's really fast.
It's sorting a ripe ripe tomatoes really

2079
01:39:50,131 --> 01:39:55,131
quick.
It'll slow it down here in a second 

2080
01:39:55,131 --> 01:39:55,131
fastest.
Whoa.

2081
01:39:55,131 --> 01:39:57,450
How can it see the.
Oh my God.

2082
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:00,480
So it sees the green tomatoes and it 
just knocks him out.

2083
01:40:00,690 --> 01:40:02,550
Yeah.
What the fuck?

2084
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:04,860
Because the computer is essentially 
seeing what we're seeing now.

2085
01:40:04,861 --> 01:40:06,540
He's hitting them.
So.

2086
01:40:06,541 --> 01:40:09,360
Perfect.
That's insane.

2087
01:40:09,450 --> 01:40:14,160
So as they're coming down this ramp,
these computers are.

2088
01:40:14,220 --> 01:40:15,950
Oh my God.
That's in real time.

2089
01:40:16,090 --> 01:40:17,670
Yeah.
Holy Shit Dude.

2090
01:40:17,700 --> 01:40:22,700
So he's got this computer vision that's 
processing it and because computers are 

2091
01:40:22,700 --> 01:40:23,140
fast enough to do this now,
my God,

2092
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:25,050
we're fucked.
It's just gonna get festival.

2093
01:40:25,810 --> 01:40:28,680
So fucked.
That scares the shit out of me more than

2094
01:40:28,681 --> 01:40:32,940
the backflipping robot.
Imagine that backflipping robot can move

2095
01:40:33,330 --> 01:40:34,440
really fast.
Yeah.

2096
01:40:34,441 --> 01:40:38,250
Well that's what Elon Musk said.
You won't be able to see him use.

2097
01:40:38,360 --> 01:40:39,950
Have a strobe light.
Yeah.

2098
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:45,200
And you know they're going to be super 
accurate shooting things and take your 

2099
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:45,200
eye out.
Yeah.

2100
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:46,410
They're not gonna have any trigger 
panic.

2101
01:40:46,700 --> 01:40:49,410
Just going to be able to just be like 
robots.

2102
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:51,780
God Damn it.
So that's,

2103
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:56,840
that's a real,
that's a real to put down the chem 

2104
01:40:56,840 --> 01:40:59,251
trails,
walk away from the flat earth and 

2105
01:40:59,251 --> 01:41:00,400
understand that there's sentient robots.
What did you,

2106
01:41:00,490 --> 01:41:00,870
okay,
you,

2107
01:41:00,871 --> 01:41:03,400
you have a background in computers.
What did you,

2108
01:41:03,790 --> 01:41:08,790
what was your take on that whole thing?
When Google had to shut down these two 

2109
01:41:09,491 --> 01:41:14,491
computers,
communicating with each other because 

2110
01:41:14,491 --> 01:41:14,780
they started talking in a language that 
they didn't understand the.

2111
01:41:14,900 --> 01:41:19,900
I mean,
that's what I was talking about that 

2112
01:41:19,900 --> 01:41:19,900
with the generative adapted networks,
they uh,

2113
01:41:21,320 --> 01:41:26,320
they didn't have to shut them down,
but they did because they were a little 

2114
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:26,320
freaked out.
Oh,

2115
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:28,050
they shut them down because they 
couldn't do anything with them.

2116
01:41:28,900 --> 01:41:33,900
It was the two,
two computers talking to each other in 

2117
01:41:33,900 --> 01:41:33,900
Gobbledygook.
Say if it was something interesting,

2118
01:41:33,900 --> 01:41:35,200
they would have kept them and studied 
it.

2119
01:41:35,390 --> 01:41:37,510
The thing that they knew what the 
computers are saying,

2120
01:41:37,830 --> 01:41:39,460
computers knew what they're saying to 
each other.

2121
01:41:39,540 --> 01:41:40,100
No,
no.

2122
01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:42,690
It was just some kind of loop that they 
got stuck in.

2123
01:41:42,700 --> 01:41:47,700
It probably wasn't particularly 
intelligent or anything so much more 

2124
01:41:47,700 --> 01:41:51,061
ominous to say that they have the 
language they weren't like plotting to 

2125
01:41:51,061 --> 01:41:54,691
take over the world.
How do you know it's because we aren't 

2126
01:41:54,691 --> 01:41:55,840
there yet,
but they would've already done it.

2127
01:41:55,890 --> 01:41:58,480
The first things computers do sexually 
harass each other.

2128
01:41:59,140 --> 01:42:04,120
They send Computer Dick Pics.
What would that even look like the other

2129
01:42:04,121 --> 01:42:06,340
day?
Like what's the AI gender going to be?

2130
01:42:06,430 --> 01:42:09,070
Has anyone decided or has it been talked
about?

2131
01:42:09,100 --> 01:42:14,100
Maybe that's what's going on with all 
this crazy push to accept 78 different 

2132
01:42:16,061 --> 01:42:21,061
gender pronouns and non binary people 
and all this stuff that didn't exist in 

2133
01:42:21,061 --> 01:42:22,050
the past.
Maybe were move.

2134
01:42:22,120 --> 01:42:27,120
Maybe there's like a natural inclination
in the human species to move towards a 

2135
01:42:27,521 --> 01:42:30,770
genderless prototype of the future.
We,

2136
01:42:30,970 --> 01:42:33,220
we went into this in depth yesterday 
under the influence,

2137
01:42:33,580 --> 01:42:35,260
obviously we did a podcast.

2138
01:42:35,260 --> 01:42:40,150
We were talking about like what an alien
is the archetype alien with the big head

2139
01:42:40,470 --> 01:42:45,470
in the very thin body and the mouth.
It's like barely visible that.

2140
01:42:45,491 --> 01:42:50,200
I think that this is probably what we 
see ourselves becoming when we have some

2141
01:42:50,201 --> 01:42:52,600
sort of a symbiotic relationship with 
technology.

2142
01:42:52,601 --> 01:42:57,601
When technology becomes a part of us,
when we have the ability to manipulate 

2143
01:42:57,601 --> 01:42:59,470
genes,
which is absolutely coming,

2144
01:42:59,620 --> 01:43:04,600
and then we have this enormous head,
which I mean look at our heads,

2145
01:43:04,601 --> 01:43:06,400
right?
It's not very practical.

2146
01:43:06,420 --> 01:43:11,420
Enormous head.
Neil degrasse Tyson was talking about 

2147
01:43:11,420 --> 01:43:11,420
this recently being all over the place.
They were talking.

2148
01:43:11,420 --> 01:43:13,810
He was talking to Ray Kurzweil in a 
podcast.

2149
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:16,150
I was listening to Ray Kurzweil,
the futurist,

2150
01:43:16,151 --> 01:43:21,151
and they were talking about the size of 
a human head and that human head could 

2151
01:43:21,151 --> 01:43:24,880
only get so big because of the mortality
issue with the mother,

2152
01:43:25,020 --> 01:43:30,020
like the mother could not give birth to 
the head can only be so big and that 

2153
01:43:30,020 --> 01:43:34,741
it's also one of the reasons why folding
over the skull in our heads are so big 

2154
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:40,560
that we have to be born like almost 
helpless as opposed to like other 

2155
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:40,960
animals that are born.

2156
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:43,300
They're pretty pretty agile,
like right out of the box,

2157
01:43:43,301 --> 01:43:45,820
like a deer or a horse or something like
that.

2158
01:43:46,050 --> 01:43:51,050
Or even primates.
Primates have very little body fat on 

2159
01:43:51,050 --> 01:43:52,820
them and they're.
They're much stronger than a young human

2160
01:43:52,821 --> 01:43:57,821
baby and that the design of the vagina 
in the head like leaves,

2161
01:43:58,520 --> 01:44:02,720
little room for advancement in the state
that we're going as far as it can go,

2162
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:06,590
but if we move away,
I was thinking from China,

2163
01:44:06,620 --> 01:44:08,110
from Vagina's not,
not,

2164
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:10,100
not genres,
ladies.

2165
01:44:10,370 --> 01:44:13,250
That's not what I'm saying,
but what I'm saying is move towards some

2166
01:44:13,251 --> 01:44:15,650
sort of a.
A Vat.

2167
01:44:15,740 --> 01:44:18,500
Yeah.
Something there can put together in some

2168
01:44:18,501 --> 01:44:23,501
sort of a new concoction,
some sort of a new artificial womb that 

2169
01:44:23,601 --> 01:44:26,210
doesn't have any size constraints.
Why don't you want a big hat?

2170
01:44:26,690 --> 01:44:31,690
Well,
if you don't give a fuck about what you 

2171
01:44:31,690 --> 01:44:33,311
look like,
the big head would allow you to see the 

2172
01:44:33,311 --> 01:44:33,311
future that you could have massive cut 
like that.

2173
01:44:33,311 --> 01:44:33,830
That would.
That's a freaky one.

2174
01:44:33,940 --> 01:44:35,470
That's not ready yet because it is a big
head.

2175
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:41,200
Well,
there's that version of the alien or 

2176
01:44:41,200 --> 01:44:41,200
there's the bodybuilder alien from 
fetus,

2177
01:44:41,200 --> 01:44:43,550
which seems less likely.
It's just a grunt.

2178
01:44:43,551 --> 01:44:46,260
I think just the missing link.
So now.

2179
01:44:46,310 --> 01:44:47,450
But I think like with the big head 
thing,

2180
01:44:47,470 --> 01:44:52,470
like I don't think you need to grow 
bigger brains behave and you could 

2181
01:44:52,470 --> 01:44:55,391
probably do a lot better by having some 
kind of implant silicon type thing and 

2182
01:44:55,391 --> 01:44:56,840
that little computer running in your 
brain.

2183
01:44:56,870 --> 01:45:00,760
But what if you had a huge computer,
like 100 iphones,

2184
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:01,580
dom,
dom,

2185
01:45:01,581 --> 01:45:06,581
dom,
he covered a bigger brains as well 

2186
01:45:06,581 --> 01:45:09,521
because there's a limit to that.
Let's apply like your brain is already 

2187
01:45:09,521 --> 01:45:11,741
using if you're using so you can have to
have oxygen tanks so strapped to your 

2188
01:45:11,741 --> 01:45:13,310
back to what if we go away from all that
stuff?

2189
01:45:13,370 --> 01:45:16,280
What have they figured out?
Some sort of a vision way.

2190
01:45:16,650 --> 01:45:18,170
Just have like a,
Whoa,

2191
01:45:18,171 --> 01:45:20,840
what is this?
Before there's a.

2192
01:45:20,841 --> 01:45:25,841
They put a lamb out and had it in an 
artificial womb and it survived for a 

2193
01:45:25,841 --> 01:45:28,130
few weeks at least when I was growing up
or we were like a few weeks.

2194
01:45:28,150 --> 01:45:30,350
I worked a little sort of science 
fiction.

2195
01:45:30,470 --> 01:45:34,700
Now what will.
But I think that's entirely possible for

2196
01:45:34,701 --> 01:45:38,240
the future.
And then the idea of human beings moving

2197
01:45:38,241 --> 01:45:43,241
away from biological bodies and if they 
figured out a way to download 

2198
01:45:43,341 --> 01:45:45,380
consciousness,
which is one a Kurzweil's things,

2199
01:45:45,381 --> 01:45:50,381
right?
To figure out a way to get to a point 

2200
01:45:50,381 --> 01:45:51,920
where consciousness is something that 
can be transferred as a freaky idea that

2201
01:45:51,980 --> 01:45:53,960
freaky to me because as someone like Kim
Jong,

2202
01:45:53,990 --> 01:45:58,990
Uhm,
we makes a thousand of himself and 

2203
01:45:58,990 --> 01:46:02,110
fucking put them all over the world.
What if consciousness gets taken over,

2204
01:46:02,601 --> 01:46:07,601
but it's,
you actually die and you just.

2205
01:46:07,820 --> 01:46:10,730
This robot facsimile of you is what 
continues.

2206
01:46:11,240 --> 01:46:13,430
What if you make two copies of yourself?
Yeah.

2207
01:46:13,670 --> 01:46:18,260
Do you want them as a sky diver?
The trial bull riding?

2208
01:46:18,261 --> 01:46:20,450
Because if you can hit a button,
download someone's consciousness.

2209
01:46:20,451 --> 01:46:23,050
You can you imagine if that's what you 
decided to do.

2210
01:46:23,060 --> 01:46:27,830
You just do all reckless shit with one 
of your body and you start mma fighting.

2211
01:46:27,831 --> 01:46:30,710
And then would you like download that 
experience back into your other buddy?

2212
01:46:31,240 --> 01:46:32,390
Yeah,
I'll just die.

2213
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:33,660
No,
you would download it.

2214
01:46:33,661 --> 01:46:37,070
You'd have the other body on steroids 
and you have the other body like working

2215
01:46:37,071 --> 01:46:42,071
out at the Olympic training center.
And turn the other body until like a 

2216
01:46:42,071 --> 01:46:45,011
super athlete and then the one that you 
sky dive in and doing backflips with the

2217
01:46:45,890 --> 01:46:50,890
augmented brains,
they're going to come along before 

2218
01:46:50,890 --> 01:46:50,890
things like that.
I think you're,

2219
01:46:50,890 --> 01:46:50,890
I think it's something

2220
01:46:50,890 --> 01:46:55,100
that with ai is coming along is like a 
bots chat bots on the Internet actually 

2221
01:46:55,100 --> 01:46:56,610
creating content.
Yes.

2222
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Not just like creating,
like talking things like posts on 

2223
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Youtube.
They can create pictures like these,

2224
01:47:02,110 --> 01:47:07,110
you know,
these networks I was talking about can 

2225
01:47:07,110 --> 01:47:08,280
actually create videos that looked like 
real videos.

2226
01:47:08,550 --> 01:47:13,550
So I think you're going to get actual 
content creators which are artificial 

2227
01:47:13,550 --> 01:47:17,271
intelligence,
like youtube personalities that are 

2228
01:47:17,271 --> 01:47:20,310
actually artificial intelligence.
But some of them will be overt like,

2229
01:47:20,311 --> 01:47:21,960
you know,
the is Google's new bots,

2230
01:47:22,050 --> 01:47:23,430
you know,
posting on the Internet going,

2231
01:47:23,431 --> 01:47:24,560
hey everybody,
I Google,

2232
01:47:25,150 --> 01:47:25,880
uh,
uh,

2233
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:31,200
and then you'll get people,
you'll get ais pretending to be real 

2234
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:34,491
people and then you get these ais 
pretending to be real people in 

2235
01:47:34,491 --> 01:47:39,170
thousands if not millions of social 
media accounts trying to influence 

2236
01:47:39,361 --> 01:47:41,250
people.
Wow.

2237
01:47:41,330 --> 01:47:43,530
Then you talk about like Bot nets and 
things,

2238
01:47:43,531 --> 01:47:47,490
but that just like people just posting 
shit like reposting memes and things,

2239
01:47:47,850 --> 01:47:52,850
what if you actually get an artificial 
intelligence that can actually hold a 

2240
01:47:52,850 --> 01:47:56,841
conversation with someone at an 
artificial intelligence that's actually 

2241
01:47:56,841 --> 01:48:00,111
more intelligent than the person that 
you're holding is holding the 

2242
01:48:00,111 --> 01:48:00,111
conversation with it.

2243
01:48:00,111 --> 01:48:04,640
We'll be able to manipulate that person 
and control them and since it's a 

2244
01:48:04,640 --> 01:48:08,750
computer doing it,
you could have thousands or millions of 

2245
01:48:08,750 --> 01:48:12,471
them and you could do all kinds of 
targeted like social media campaigns 

2246
01:48:13,050 --> 01:48:14,130
going on right now.
Yeah,

2247
01:48:14,131 --> 01:48:18,090
but they're not.
They're not actually like a habit.

2248
01:48:18,160 --> 01:48:21,090
It's not an artificial intelligence 
having a real conversation with people.

2249
01:48:21,270 --> 01:48:26,270
We're on the verge of that,
but they do have artificial bots that 

2250
01:48:26,270 --> 01:48:27,950
will go out and attack.
People do have things on those.

2251
01:48:27,970 --> 01:48:29,880
The simplistic things.
They're spamming things.

2252
01:48:29,970 --> 01:48:32,640
You can tell there are bought fairly 
easily for now.

2253
01:48:32,700 --> 01:48:37,700
Yeah.
We're getting to the stage where you 

2254
01:48:37,700 --> 01:48:37,700
won't be able to tell that it's the 
ball.

2255
01:48:37,700 --> 01:48:40,050
They'll be someone who would be in in a 
few decades.

2256
01:48:40,051 --> 01:48:45,051
There'll be people,
there'll be artificial intelligence is 

2257
01:48:45,051 --> 01:48:47,820
that will be just as intelligent as you 
or me and we'll be able to have the same

2258
01:48:47,821 --> 01:48:52,530
conversations on social media that you 
and I can have on social media right now

2259
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:53,790
and people wouldn't be able to tell.

2260
01:48:53,790 --> 01:48:56,820
The difference is this big famous test 
in ai,

2261
01:48:56,821 --> 01:48:59,340
which is the cheering test where the 
test is.

2262
01:48:59,341 --> 01:49:04,341
Someone sits in a room with a typewriter
and they talked to the computer in the 

2263
01:49:04,341 --> 01:49:04,350
other room when,
if you can tell it's a computer,

2264
01:49:05,030 --> 01:49:10,030
uh,
then it passes the turing test and it's 

2265
01:49:10,030 --> 01:49:10,290
meant to be intelligent and they can't 
tell that it's a computer.

2266
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:11,520
Yeah.
If as a computer.

2267
01:49:11,970 --> 01:49:15,170
So there's been very limited successes 
with that if you like,

2268
01:49:15,240 --> 01:49:19,770
restricts the topics to just baseball or
Britney spears or something like that.

2269
01:49:19,771 --> 01:49:24,771
They had these very limited domains that
they can talk about that if you get a 

2270
01:49:24,771 --> 01:49:28,161
general purpose ai that is actually 
intelligent and can and has goals to 

2271
01:49:28,161 --> 01:49:30,780
change someone's mind about something 
like politics,

2272
01:49:31,320 --> 01:49:33,230
you could have a real problem.
Well,

2273
01:49:33,280 --> 01:49:38,280
we were talking about Duncan and I 
yesterday were saying think about 

2274
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:41,660
someone creating an artificial version 
of him based on the hundreds of hours of

2275
01:49:42,091 --> 01:49:47,091
his audio recordings because he has so 
many podcasts as do I know if somebody 

2276
01:49:47,091 --> 01:49:47,091
wanted to take a

2277
01:49:49,780 --> 01:49:54,780
like mine where there's a thousand 
episodes and take those thousand plus 

2278
01:49:54,780 --> 01:49:58,300
episodes and take my opinions and the 
way I describe things,

2279
01:49:58,301 --> 01:50:01,270
the way I talk.
I mean like if you're talking to me in a

2280
01:50:01,271 --> 01:50:03,220
podcast like this,
you're just talking to me.

2281
01:50:03,221 --> 01:50:04,570
This is what I talk like,
so.

2282
01:50:04,710 --> 01:50:06,700
And you'd get a bunch of variables,
right?

2283
01:50:06,701 --> 01:50:09,400
You get me excited,
me depressed me,

2284
01:50:09,401 --> 01:50:11,050
shocked me,
sad me.

2285
01:50:11,051 --> 01:50:14,560
Happy.
You would have so much to choose from.

2286
01:50:14,561 --> 01:50:16,260
Yeah.
You could look kind of material.

2287
01:50:16,510 --> 01:50:20,830
You could kind of like fill in the 
blanks and guests pretty accurately.

2288
01:50:20,831 --> 01:50:23,040
How I would react or respond to certain.

2289
01:50:23,500 --> 01:50:27,820
One of the episodes of Black Mirror,
British TV show,

2290
01:50:28,170 --> 01:50:29,080
great show.
Yeah.

2291
01:50:29,140 --> 01:50:32,650
It was about some woman whose husband 
had died,

2292
01:50:33,250 --> 01:50:38,250
but he had all this video of him.
There was a service that set up an ai 

2293
01:50:38,771 --> 01:50:40,810
version offerman and it starts out 
small,

2294
01:50:40,811 --> 01:50:45,811
like someone who would post on social 
media as him and eventually it grew to 

2295
01:50:46,061 --> 01:50:48,650
be this don't spoil alert me.
Right.

2296
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:51,220
I just watched an episode of the.
The other day is a good.

2297
01:50:51,380 --> 01:50:53,440
That one.
Thank you.

2298
01:50:53,470 --> 01:50:54,640
Thank you.
It's a good episode.

2299
01:50:54,670 --> 01:50:55,330
Oh,
so good.

2300
01:50:55,360 --> 01:51:00,360
I watched one the other day about the 
video games that they put that thing in 

2301
01:51:00,360 --> 01:51:00,360
the back of your head.
Did you see that one?

2302
01:51:00,580 --> 01:51:03,480
It's in the new season.
This also too.

2303
01:51:03,560 --> 01:51:04,540
God Damn.
It's good.

2304
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:06,760
That's a great show and it's come out a 
couple of weeks.

2305
01:51:07,210 --> 01:51:07,800
Three weeks,
man.

2306
01:51:08,770 --> 01:51:11,770
Joe Rogan does not like it though.
Freaked out.

2307
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:16,920
It is a bit creepy.
I think she hears too much of that shit 

2308
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:16,920
from me to,
you know,

2309
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:18,460
she just gets freaked out on technology 
in the future.

2310
01:51:18,900 --> 01:51:20,170
The possibilities.
But yeah,

2311
01:51:20,171 --> 01:51:25,171
like making a fake.
Jurgen is something that is possible to 

2312
01:51:25,171 --> 01:51:28,920
easy.
You can probably do something if they 

2313
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:28,920
put enough resources in just.
Yeah,

2314
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:29,570
just Joe Rogan.
Yeah.

2315
01:51:29,950 --> 01:51:31,660
They could have something because this 
type of,

2316
01:51:31,680 --> 01:51:32,000
you know,
the,

2317
01:51:32,001 --> 01:51:36,310
the genitive adaptive generative 
generative adversarial networks,

2318
01:51:36,370 --> 01:51:38,860
this thing where they got one judge in 
one generator,

2319
01:51:39,220 --> 01:51:44,220
they'll have one ai that just tries to 
make Joe Rogan's and then they'll have 

2320
01:51:44,220 --> 01:51:48,961
another ai that,
an expert at detecting the real Joe 

2321
01:51:48,961 --> 01:51:52,520
Rogan and it'll have all this real 
material to go by and then this will 

2322
01:51:52,520 --> 01:51:52,520
keep feeding things at this and say,
well,

2323
01:51:52,520 --> 01:51:54,160
that's not quite right.
He doesn't say like that.

2324
01:51:54,161 --> 01:51:56,780
He narrows his eyes when he's confused 
and wow.

2325
01:51:57,370 --> 01:51:59,170
And eventually it will

2326
01:51:59,350 --> 01:52:02,110
come up with something that resembles 
you will.

2327
01:52:02,111 --> 01:52:07,111
Then it becomes a thing of like,
how do you know you're you and how do 

2328
01:52:08,021 --> 01:52:11,290
you know you're talking to someone else.
That's them.

2329
01:52:11,590 --> 01:52:12,670
Like,
here's the thing.

2330
01:52:13,630 --> 01:52:18,630
Let's just say,
why'd you leave this rubber Dick to 

2331
01:52:18,630 --> 01:52:18,630
sitting right here?
Rude.

2332
01:52:20,210 --> 01:52:21,970
Chris Ryan gave me a rubber Dick.
Sorry,

2333
01:52:22,420 --> 01:52:23,740
I just noticed it.
I looked over,

2334
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:25,810
had a comment.
Say,

2335
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:27,220
let's say if,
uh,

2336
01:52:27,580 --> 01:52:32,580
say your father died,
which is one of Ray Kurzweil's big 

2337
01:52:32,580 --> 01:52:33,700
things.
His,

2338
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:37,870
one of his primary motivations is to 
recreate his father.

2339
01:52:38,200 --> 01:52:43,200
He lost his father when he was young and
he believes that through the advent of 

2340
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:46,040
artificial intelligence and through the 
data that is collected

2341
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:51,040
to recordings of his father and the 
images that one day he will literally be

2342
01:52:51,141 --> 01:52:53,450
able to communicate with his father.
Again,

2343
01:52:54,890 --> 01:52:59,890
I don't know if that's real,
but I do know that someone like Dunkin 

2344
01:52:59,890 --> 01:53:02,740
save my friend Duncan died.
It's entirely possible that within the 

2345
01:53:02,740 --> 01:53:06,980
next 50 years they're going to be able 
to create a version of Duncan and Duncan

2346
01:53:06,981 --> 01:53:08,140
can come over and say,
hi,

2347
01:53:08,580 --> 01:53:10,130
I'm back.
Hey,

2348
01:53:10,460 --> 01:53:13,310
crazy.
I was dead and I won't even know.

2349
01:53:13,370 --> 01:53:16,430
I won't know if it's really Duncan.
You've gotta watch this episode of Black

2350
01:53:16,430 --> 01:53:17,410
Mirror that okay,
don't tell me.

2351
01:53:17,820 --> 01:53:18,480
Don't tell me,

2352
01:53:19,750 --> 01:53:21,330
but is it for to remember where I found 
us,

2353
01:53:21,331 --> 01:53:26,331
I think it was an NPR episode of 
might've been on radio lab thing called 

2354
01:53:26,331 --> 01:53:27,550
dad bought.
This guy made literally a text.

2355
01:53:27,580 --> 01:53:32,580
He used all of his dad's past text 
messages between himself and him and 

2356
01:53:32,580 --> 01:53:36,220
then made a Ai Bot he could chat with.
I think his brother can use it to.

2357
01:53:36,610 --> 01:53:38,170
They can just send generic messages 
like,

2358
01:53:38,171 --> 01:53:38,800
Hey,
how you doing?

2359
01:53:38,801 --> 01:53:40,020
And He sends something that he would 
accept

2360
01:53:40,120 --> 01:53:40,700
back.
Meanwhile,

2361
01:53:40,710 --> 01:53:41,540
your dad's like,
shut up,

2362
01:53:41,541 --> 01:53:45,020
faggot.
He Dad just says shit to you.

2363
01:53:45,030 --> 01:53:46,640
A little pussy.
You're never gonna amount to nothing.

2364
01:53:46,641 --> 01:53:47,700
Oh,
dad bod.

2365
01:53:48,120 --> 01:53:50,400
That's what your dad was like.
They wouldn't do that.

2366
01:53:50,500 --> 01:53:53,750
Yeah,
you can probably tweak it a bit though.

2367
01:53:53,880 --> 01:53:56,960
Just asking to dilate down type of thing
is coming.

2368
01:53:56,961 --> 01:54:00,680
They're like text now and it's not,
it's not like very good.

2369
01:54:00,681 --> 01:54:02,330
You'd be able to tell.
It's not a real person.

2370
01:54:02,570 --> 01:54:05,540
Did you like x Mokena?
Uh,

2371
01:54:05,600 --> 01:54:07,100
what was that the movie?
You never saw it?

2372
01:54:07,190 --> 01:54:09,410
Oh yeah,
I did see it,

2373
01:54:09,860 --> 01:54:11,470
but I've,
I forget.

2374
01:54:11,620 --> 01:54:12,980
I forget very,
very quickly.

2375
01:54:13,880 --> 01:54:16,760
That's amazing.
Was it was a plot real quick.

2376
01:54:16,790 --> 01:54:18,950
The plot was,
there was like some,

2377
01:54:20,940 --> 01:54:24,840
some wishes in a house,
super scientists who lived in the middle

2378
01:54:24,840 --> 01:54:29,840
of nowhere and they'd be flown into him 
and he had created that guy right there 

2379
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:32,510
creating artificial intelligence and 
then went over the turing test and 

2380
01:54:32,510 --> 01:54:32,510
everything in that too.

2381
01:54:32,510 --> 01:54:32,510
It's my,
one of my favorite movies.

2382
01:54:32,510 --> 01:54:34,760
That's my top 10 favorite movies of all 
time.

2383
01:54:35,240 --> 01:54:38,780
It hits so close to home and they were 
so little cut the shit in that movie.

2384
01:54:39,050 --> 01:54:44,050
You know,
I described movies based on the cut the 

2385
01:54:44,050 --> 01:54:44,050
shit scenes,
like someone who was like,

2386
01:54:44,050 --> 01:54:46,160
what?
Oh fuck is she cut the shit.

2387
01:54:46,190 --> 01:54:51,190
How the hell did that happen?
There was none of that in that movie to 

2388
01:54:51,190 --> 01:54:51,190
me.
That in that movie to me was like,

2389
01:54:51,190 --> 01:54:52,100
wow,
like this,

2390
01:54:52,130 --> 01:54:53,480
uh,
this all could take place.

2391
01:54:53,940 --> 01:54:56,660
It's paid there with these future robot 
things.

2392
01:54:56,770 --> 01:54:59,930
So much of it is just trying to make a 
robot that just like a human.

2393
01:55:00,590 --> 01:55:03,800
When the robots are not going to be like
humans,

2394
01:55:03,850 --> 01:55:05,210
they're going to be like,
silence is going to be,

2395
01:55:05,230 --> 01:55:10,230
you know,
more than humans at your command rooms 

2396
01:55:10,230 --> 01:55:11,030
doing work that I'm going to look like 
humans because it's not very practical.

2397
01:55:11,031 --> 01:55:13,100
There will be robots that look exactly 
like humans,

2398
01:55:13,101 --> 01:55:18,101
but that's just one aspect of it.
There's going to be all kinds of much 

2399
01:55:18,101 --> 01:55:19,910
more impressive robots I think of that 
tomato robot.

2400
01:55:20,050 --> 01:55:20,870
Yeah.
It's knocking.

2401
01:55:20,871 --> 01:55:23,420
It didn't have to look like a person 
just has to be functioning the way it to

2402
01:55:23,421 --> 01:55:24,560
be.
For it to be functional.

2403
01:55:24,561 --> 01:55:26,450
It's not to look like a person.
Exactly.

2404
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:29,720
It's to have these multiple fingers that
can knock away these green tomatoes.

2405
01:55:30,050 --> 01:55:30,830
So why?
Why,

2406
01:55:31,460 --> 01:55:33,770
why build something around the 
limitations of the human body.

2407
01:55:33,820 --> 01:55:36,190
This is the same guy that isn't that 
black mirror.

2408
01:55:36,191 --> 01:55:36,850
Episode two.

2409
01:55:37,220 --> 01:55:38,750
Oh,
crazy.

2410
01:55:38,950 --> 01:55:40,400
Okay.
Um,

2411
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:44,040
do you think they're gonna do a reboot 
or a sequel to

2412
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:47,340
x Mokena?
I'd heard they were going to.

2413
01:55:48,300 --> 01:55:49,050
Sure.
Why wouldn't.

2414
01:55:49,051 --> 01:55:50,670
I mean why wait man,
fucking made it better.

2415
01:55:50,671 --> 01:55:55,671
It was a really good movie,
made a bunch of money and it was 

2416
01:55:55,671 --> 01:55:55,671
amazing.
They better.

2417
01:55:55,671 --> 01:55:56,550
Um,
I am worried about that.

2418
01:55:56,610 --> 01:56:01,610
I am worried and I'm also worried that 
by the fact that guys like Elon Musk are

2419
01:56:01,651 --> 01:56:06,651
worried that when,
when someone like that worries and he 

2420
01:56:06,651 --> 01:56:06,651
starts talking about it,
I'm like,

2421
01:56:06,651 --> 01:56:08,880
well,
who is paying attention to this?

2422
01:56:09,210 --> 01:56:14,210
I mean,
how many people are really at the 

2423
01:56:14,210 --> 01:56:14,210
forefront?
And is it possible to pull that back?

2424
01:56:14,210 --> 01:56:17,871
Because I'm aware of what the United 
States is up to in terms of like what 

2425
01:56:17,871 --> 01:56:18,870
gets printed to the news.
Obviously I'm not really aware,

2426
01:56:19,350 --> 01:56:22,710
but when you get further than that,
like China,

2427
01:56:22,770 --> 01:56:23,910
Russia,
like we don't,

2428
01:56:23,911 --> 01:56:24,960
we have no idea what they're doing.

2429
01:56:25,090 --> 01:56:30,090
Yeah.
And they must be doing this type of 

2430
01:56:30,090 --> 01:56:30,090
thing.
They must be.

2431
01:56:30,090 --> 01:56:30,090
And if you don't,
they will.

2432
01:56:30,090 --> 01:56:30,430
Yeah.
It's one of those things,

2433
01:56:30,810 --> 01:56:34,390
something they don't need this huge,
a physical infrastructure,

2434
01:56:34,460 --> 01:56:38,650
like they don't need a big military or 
anything to do cyber warfare with Ai.

2435
01:56:39,160 --> 01:56:44,160
Fuck.
So they could be developing all this 

2436
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:46,051
artificial intelligence to do things 
like a infiltrate everybody's social 

2437
01:56:46,301 --> 01:56:47,890
media and make them vote for the 
difference

2438
01:56:47,930 --> 01:56:52,910
guy or just infiltrate all our power 
stations and they shut them all down.

2439
01:56:52,970 --> 01:56:55,540
That's one of the real problems that I 
have today with,

2440
01:56:55,541 --> 01:57:00,541
um,
the conversations regarding politics 

2441
01:57:00,541 --> 01:57:04,300
regarding whether or not Russia hacked 
the election is because people are so 

2442
01:57:04,300 --> 01:57:08,920
concerned with painting out their party 
to be innocent and the other party to be

2443
01:57:09,891 --> 01:57:14,891
guilty and describing all the different 
things that the Russians did and the 

2444
01:57:14,901 --> 01:57:17,640
interference and all of the,
you know,

2445
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:21,140
the subterfuge it's being used that 
were,

2446
01:57:21,350 --> 01:57:26,350
I think we're missing out on this idea 
that you can electronically affect the 

2447
01:57:27,561 --> 01:57:32,561
way people think about things if you 
have enough resources to attack an idea 

2448
01:57:36,170 --> 01:57:41,170
with propaganda through bots and this is
something that you see all the time.

2449
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:46,760
Yeah.
A lot of the stuff that Russia did was 

2450
01:57:46,760 --> 01:57:49,341
posted in closed groups on facebook.
So it's something that you really 

2451
01:57:50,581 --> 01:57:55,581
wouldn't be able to see happening.
Like if you have to be a part of the 

2452
01:57:55,581 --> 01:57:55,581
group.
Those traits.

2453
01:57:55,620 --> 01:57:57,240
Yeah.
They joined these groups,

2454
01:57:57,580 --> 01:57:58,310
uh,
and they,

2455
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:00,190
uh,
they have not bought some birch,

2456
01:58:00,200 --> 01:58:01,070
but like,
you know,

2457
01:58:02,680 --> 01:58:07,680
they had these sweatshops where all 
these people are typing away doing all 

2458
01:58:07,680 --> 01:58:10,851
kinds of stuff,
pushing out these stories and they go 

2459
01:58:10,851 --> 01:58:14,361
into these closed groups because it's 
harder for people to figure out what's 

2460
01:58:14,361 --> 01:58:16,590
going on if you're in a closed group and
they post all this stuff,

2461
01:58:16,860 --> 01:58:17,310
all these,
you know,

2462
01:58:17,450 --> 01:58:22,450
whatever,
Anti Hillary memes or whatever pro 

2463
01:58:22,450 --> 01:58:25,860
Donald Trump like pro Bernie to push a 
certain narrative.

2464
01:58:26,160 --> 01:58:31,160
One of them where the guy got busted 
because he accidentally hat on is 

2465
01:58:31,160 --> 01:58:33,210
location and showed that he was in 
Russia and uh,

2466
01:58:33,240 --> 01:58:33,880
you know,
who's

2467
01:58:34,350 --> 01:58:39,350
some guy with a make Hashtag Maga,
an American flag and his avatar and the 

2468
01:58:41,051 --> 01:58:41,850
whole deal.
Yeah.

2469
01:58:41,851 --> 01:58:42,030
It's going

2470
01:58:42,030 --> 01:58:44,680
to be really hard to figure out exactly 
what happened.

2471
01:58:44,920 --> 01:58:49,920
That it's gonna be even harder in the 
future though because we will be 

2472
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:50,170
covering the tracks a lot better.
The learning.

2473
01:58:50,470 --> 01:58:51,820
Yes,
what works,

2474
01:58:52,030 --> 01:58:57,030
but it's really hard to figure out 
what's real and what's not real right 

2475
01:58:57,030 --> 01:58:57,030
now.
Yeah.

2476
01:58:57,030 --> 01:58:59,920
You don't remember wag the dog.
What was that like 20 years ago and that

2477
01:58:59,921 --> 01:59:03,640
movie,
they described the possibility of faking

2478
01:59:03,641 --> 01:59:08,641
these conflicts and having this fake 
video and having movie directors film 

2479
01:59:08,641 --> 01:59:11,680
everything and that would influence the 
way people thought about world conflicts

2480
01:59:11,790 --> 01:59:14,100
and now we're getting to a stage where 
that technology is a lot more,

2481
01:59:14,130 --> 01:59:16,840
a little more realistic,
faking videos.

2482
01:59:16,990 --> 01:59:21,990
You were pretty close.
There are things where you can take 

2483
01:59:21,990 --> 01:59:24,481
audio now and just basically sample 
audio and create anything that person 

2484
01:59:25,121 --> 01:59:25,990
might say.
Yeah,

2485
01:59:25,991 --> 01:59:30,760
that was a radiolab podcast where they 
did it and it's still a little crude,

2486
01:59:30,761 --> 01:59:35,761
but like most things,
I mean you go back to the very first 

2487
01:59:35,761 --> 01:59:39,721
oculus rift,
which was only a few years ago and it 

2488
01:59:39,721 --> 01:59:43,201
was a pixilated and clunky looking,
but if you look at the htc vive now 

2489
01:59:43,420 --> 01:59:46,360
they're virtual reality's pretty 
spectacular.

2490
01:59:47,040 --> 01:59:49,930
You could still tell that it's not real,
but man,

2491
01:59:49,931 --> 01:59:51,640
the experience is so much more 
immersive.

2492
01:59:51,730 --> 01:59:56,730
Yeah.
I remember reading a book back in the 

2493
01:59:56,730 --> 01:59:58,351
nineties.
I think it's less than zero by Brett 

2494
01:59:58,351 --> 01:59:58,351
Easton.
Ellis.

2495
01:59:58,351 --> 01:59:58,510
Yeah,
and this is seen in that way.

2496
01:59:58,511 --> 02:00:03,511
They,
they map somebodies face onto like a 

2497
02:00:03,511 --> 02:00:04,660
pulling,
pulling back to a,

2498
02:00:04,720 --> 02:00:07,960
and at the time I thought that was the 
most ridiculously stupid thing I've ever

2499
02:00:07,961 --> 02:00:12,961
heard of because they would never 
possibly work and there's no way of 

2500
02:00:12,961 --> 02:00:15,331
getting that degree of accuracy and now 
I've got an app in my iphone that 

2501
02:00:15,331 --> 02:00:19,531
actually does it to a reasonable degree 
where it's quite hard sometimes to see 

2502
02:00:20,111 --> 02:00:22,120
what's going on.
There's this thing called um,

2503
02:00:22,310 --> 02:00:26,500
mugged life,
which is just a toy app where you take a

2504
02:00:26,501 --> 02:00:31,501
picture of yourself and instantly like 
mapsys onto a three d face and you can 

2505
02:00:31,501 --> 02:00:32,980
do all these expressions and you can say
these things.

2506
02:00:32,980 --> 02:00:37,980
He can.
He has these like meme generators and 

2507
02:00:37,980 --> 02:00:38,600
it's basically,
it's,

2508
02:00:38,650 --> 02:00:40,870
it's that type of thing,
which I thought was ridiculous.

2509
02:00:40,871 --> 02:00:43,810
Speculation like 20 years ago.
But now it's come to pass.

2510
02:00:43,900 --> 02:00:48,490
While there is an article that I tweeted
today about Gal Godot,

2511
02:00:48,730 --> 02:00:51,940
who is the woman from wonder woman,
they've take,

2512
02:00:51,970 --> 02:00:55,720
they use an algorithm and they tape her 
face onto a porn video.

2513
02:00:55,780 --> 02:00:58,660
Yeah.
So they have her doing porn and it looks

2514
02:00:58,720 --> 02:01:03,720
just like her.
You can kind of tell a little bit that 

2515
02:01:03,720 --> 02:01:04,330
it's not her,
but not much.

2516
02:01:04,720 --> 02:01:07,210
It's enough where you like,
Whoa,

2517
02:01:07,390 --> 02:01:12,390
they're going to get really good at this
and then there'll be able to have you 

2518
02:01:12,390 --> 02:01:12,460
doing anything.
You could be a murderer,

2519
02:01:12,461 --> 02:01:16,590
they can have you outside murdering 
people and they put that in the news and

2520
02:01:16,600 --> 02:01:19,050
then by the time they retract it,
you know,

2521
02:01:19,390 --> 02:01:21,400
and they say,
I'll make west wasn't really out there.

2522
02:01:21,670 --> 02:01:23,800
Just gunning people down.
It was someone else.

2523
02:01:23,801 --> 02:01:26,290
Your neighbors don't trust you anymore.
You have to move.

2524
02:01:26,291 --> 02:01:28,030
The damage is done,
you know,

2525
02:01:28,031 --> 02:01:33,031
and that's not,
not that I support like the fucking 

2526
02:01:33,460 --> 02:01:38,460
hysterics and the craziness that trump 
tweets and all the different shit that 

2527
02:01:38,460 --> 02:01:39,860
he tweets,
but occasionally they get things wrong

2528
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:41,900
and they make stories about him.
Like,

2529
02:01:42,180 --> 02:01:44,570
like the CNN,
Russia story where they had a fire.

2530
02:01:44,571 --> 02:01:46,500
Those three.
Yeah.

2531
02:01:46,820 --> 02:01:49,550
Well when they,
after they had fired those reporters who

2532
02:01:49,551 --> 02:01:54,290
had made these erroneous connections and
had this like a flaw written piece,

2533
02:01:54,830 --> 02:01:59,830
they fired them.
But the story has already been written 

2534
02:01:59,830 --> 02:02:02,120
like this is,
I guess there's a rush to get things out

2535
02:02:02,121 --> 02:02:07,121
there and they're trying very hard,
but you've got to be very careful 

2536
02:02:07,121 --> 02:02:08,810
because once something's out there,
that initial thing of being out there is

2537
02:02:08,811 --> 02:02:10,760
so much more powerful than any 
retraction.

2538
02:02:10,840 --> 02:02:15,840
Yeah.
It's really hard to get retractions out 

2539
02:02:15,840 --> 02:02:16,630
because the original thing just goes so 
much more than the retraction.

2540
02:02:16,900 --> 02:02:21,710
Especially if it's crazy.
Really more thing going on right now.

2541
02:02:21,800 --> 02:02:25,750
The election today,
there's a thing where they said that his

2542
02:02:25,751 --> 02:02:30,751
signature was fake because the ink on 
the image was like black on one side and

2543
02:02:30,791 --> 02:02:32,860
blue on the other side.
So they said,

2544
02:02:32,861 --> 02:02:37,861
oh,
this must have been faked because this 

2545
02:02:37,861 --> 02:02:38,050
half of the Roy is black and the more 
blue.

2546
02:02:38,051 --> 02:02:43,051
So I was looking into that and I did 
some experiments where I did a signature

2547
02:02:44,171 --> 02:02:46,270
and then held it at an angle and took 
photos of it.

2548
02:02:46,271 --> 02:02:51,271
And I found out that this,
this type of chromatic aberration from 

2549
02:02:51,271 --> 02:02:54,841
the camera,
which just does that with ink and it's 

2550
02:02:54,841 --> 02:02:56,620
very easy to duplicate and you can show 
that this was actually what was going on

2551
02:02:56,860 --> 02:02:58,810
in his image,
and then you can look at other images of

2552
02:02:58,811 --> 02:03:01,900
the signature from different angles 
which show that it's all black.

2553
02:03:02,290 --> 02:03:07,290
So those,
there's one image on CNN that she had 

2554
02:03:07,290 --> 02:03:07,290
this blue and black ink.
And uh,

2555
02:03:07,290 --> 02:03:10,960
then I figured out that it was just this
trick of the camera,

2556
02:03:11,770 --> 02:03:16,050
but even though it's been debunked and 
explained this,

2557
02:03:16,210 --> 02:03:18,580
people are still spreading the exact 
same thing around.

2558
02:03:18,780 --> 02:03:20,530
So that's not real.
And that can be a problem.

2559
02:03:20,531 --> 02:03:21,700
It could swing the election.
Yeah.

2560
02:03:21,710 --> 02:03:23,530
And it's time limited,
that type of thing.

2561
02:03:23,560 --> 02:03:23,930
Like,
you know,

2562
02:03:24,080 --> 02:03:25,430
it's done today,
after today.

2563
02:03:25,440 --> 02:03:26,140
It doesn't really matter.

2564
02:03:26,200 --> 02:03:31,000
There was also something about him 
writing something in someone's yearbook.

2565
02:03:31,480 --> 02:03:33,590
Yeah.
That was the book thing was the,

2566
02:03:34,110 --> 02:03:39,110
the thing was they said that the woman 
had forged the entry to the yearbook,

2567
02:03:39,190 --> 02:03:44,190
but that's not the case.
What she had done was written the date 

2568
02:03:44,680 --> 02:03:47,410
of the note,
the old hickory house.

2569
02:03:48,280 --> 02:03:50,020
Yes,
but she didn't,

2570
02:03:50,080 --> 02:03:53,620
didn't forge the actual words she is,
but that's a.

2571
02:03:53,680 --> 02:03:58,680
that's a problem.
The problem is that she did do it and 

2572
02:03:58,680 --> 02:03:58,680
she didn't say she did it.

2573
02:03:58,680 --> 02:04:00,230
There's so many people want that to be 
true,

2574
02:04:00,231 --> 02:04:05,231
that it was forged.
That if you can take something that's 

2575
02:04:05,231 --> 02:04:05,680
like slightly problematic,
like her,

2576
02:04:05,681 --> 02:04:10,681
like not saying that she actually added 
this annotation afterwards and then you 

2577
02:04:10,681 --> 02:04:13,640
can say that,
that she admitted to it being forged,

2578
02:04:14,180 --> 02:04:17,080
which is basically a lie,
but it,

2579
02:04:17,150 --> 02:04:20,390
it will stick for long enough.
It doesn't really matter that it's a lie

2580
02:04:20,391 --> 02:04:21,290
because you know,
in,

2581
02:04:21,660 --> 02:04:26,660
you know,
by the end of the day today he doesn't 

2582
02:04:26,660 --> 02:04:27,110
really matter at all.
So only had to do was get this story out

2583
02:04:27,111 --> 02:04:32,111
there.
You had enough stuff in it to make it 

2584
02:04:32,111 --> 02:04:32,230
seem vaguely plausible to people who 
wanted to believe that she,

2585
02:04:32,300 --> 02:04:33,110
she fortunate.

2586
02:04:33,210 --> 02:04:37,950
Did she forged the date and did she try 
to say that that date was

2587
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:40,290
written by him?
She,

2588
02:04:40,530 --> 02:04:42,330
I didn't note underneath it had the 
date,

2589
02:04:42,390 --> 02:04:44,220
but he had also written on the date 
above.

2590
02:04:44,790 --> 02:04:45,540
He wrote like,
you know,

2591
02:04:45,570 --> 02:04:47,240
to a sweeter,
more darling girl,

2592
02:04:47,250 --> 02:04:50,070
I could never say merry Christmas,
Roy Moore,

2593
02:04:50,071 --> 02:04:54,120
77 and then underneath she addressed and
uh,

2594
02:04:54,840 --> 02:04:57,000
old hickory house,
1977.

2595
02:04:57,630 --> 02:05:00,660
And did she try to claim that he had 
written that originally?

2596
02:05:00,661 --> 02:05:03,480
It seemed like she was saying that he'd 
written the whole thing.

2597
02:05:03,650 --> 02:05:04,800
Uh,
uh,

2598
02:05:04,801 --> 02:05:05,910
it's.
And she,

2599
02:05:05,911 --> 02:05:07,890
she read out the inscription and she 
said,

2600
02:05:07,940 --> 02:05:09,780
Roy Moore wrote this in my book,
Blah,

2601
02:05:09,781 --> 02:05:10,050
blah,
blah,

2602
02:05:10,051 --> 02:05:10,380
blah,
blah.

2603
02:05:10,381 --> 02:05:15,381
And she'd read the,
the annotation at the end of the 

2604
02:05:15,381 --> 02:05:15,480
annotation at the end.
Recent?

2605
02:05:15,960 --> 02:05:16,890
Yeah.
Nothing.

2606
02:05:16,950 --> 02:05:18,660
I think she said she wrote it like 
afterwards,

2607
02:05:18,661 --> 02:05:20,460
like you have to shoe.
Oh,

2608
02:05:21,180 --> 02:05:23,190
the same day.
Oh,

2609
02:05:23,191 --> 02:05:28,191
so how the fuck achieving remember how 
do you remember what you wrote down in 

2610
02:05:28,191 --> 02:05:30,900
1977 at that handwriting is a bit 
different between them.

2611
02:05:30,900 --> 02:05:33,540
So it was fairly obvious that it wasn't 
the same,

2612
02:05:33,780 --> 02:05:37,320
the same handwriting from stuff that's 
like her today.

2613
02:05:37,530 --> 02:05:42,530
Trying to frame him,
that seems more like she was just 

2614
02:05:42,530 --> 02:05:43,170
documenting it at the time.
And for golf,

2615
02:05:43,171 --> 02:05:44,880
anything,
it makes it more realistic.

2616
02:05:44,881 --> 02:05:47,180
So if she was going to forge it,
she would afford to.

2617
02:05:47,181 --> 02:05:50,640
The whole thing was she's talking about 
something for 40 years ago.

2618
02:05:50,980 --> 02:05:51,470
Like,
ah,

2619
02:05:51,780 --> 02:05:52,980
yeah,
that's this,

2620
02:05:53,100 --> 02:05:58,100
this whole thing of trying to,
like someone's saying that this 

2621
02:05:58,111 --> 02:06:00,780
definitely happened 40 years ago is to 
me,

2622
02:06:00,900 --> 02:06:05,900
so bonkers to the hell could you,
and this is a real problem with the 

2623
02:06:06,151 --> 02:06:07,550
news,
you know,

2624
02:06:07,560 --> 02:06:10,830
like one of the Al Franken accusers we 
were talking about yesterday,

2625
02:06:10,890 --> 02:06:13,200
uh,
claim that Al had grabbed her,

2626
02:06:13,500 --> 02:06:18,500
her waist and squoze her fat and some 
sort of way when she's talking about 

2627
02:06:18,500 --> 02:06:19,680
something 10 years ago.
Like,

2628
02:06:19,681 --> 02:06:24,681
you absolutely remember what happened in
something so inconsequential 10 years 

2629
02:06:25,021 --> 02:06:25,230
ago.

2630
02:06:25,230 --> 02:06:30,230
That seems insane to me.
Now you add 30 years onto that and I'm 

2631
02:06:30,230 --> 02:06:30,300
just calling bullshit.
Yeah.

2632
02:06:30,450 --> 02:06:35,450
The,
you can't really remember the level of 

2633
02:06:35,450 --> 02:06:35,450
detail that a lot.
I mean,

2634
02:06:35,450 --> 02:06:38,130
even if you would have to be something 
really significant,

2635
02:06:38,910 --> 02:06:41,280
but even then you knew about creative 
memories.

2636
02:06:41,310 --> 02:06:43,290
Yeah.
People's memories change over time.

2637
02:06:43,320 --> 02:06:46,050
Yes.
A lot of people a claim,

2638
02:06:46,051 --> 02:06:49,080
they remember where they were when they 
heard about the space shuttle blowing up

2639
02:06:49,081 --> 02:06:50,400
the first one.
Yeah.

2640
02:06:50,401 --> 02:06:54,930
The people have done extensive research 
into that like tracking people's stories

2641
02:06:54,931 --> 02:06:59,931
over like a decade or so,
and they found that a significant 

2642
02:06:59,931 --> 02:07:02,040
percentage of people change the store is
10 years later,

2643
02:07:02,160 --> 02:07:07,160
I'm sure asked about why they were so 
like for something like harassment or 

2644
02:07:07,160 --> 02:07:12,141
something like that.
It's entirely possible that the story 

2645
02:07:12,141 --> 02:07:12,141
could change.
Doesn't mean that it's false.

2646
02:07:12,141 --> 02:07:16,730
It's just possible that it could change,
but they're there conveniently 

2647
02:07:16,730 --> 02:07:20,421
forgetting or ignoring that human 
memories insanely flawed and malleable 

2648
02:07:22,020 --> 02:07:27,020
and I think part of why we have statute 
of limitations because like things like 

2649
02:07:27,020 --> 02:07:29,100
eyewitness testimony essentially 
degrades over time.

2650
02:07:29,700 --> 02:07:34,700
That's one of the things that I'm really
hoping is going to be cured with 

2651
02:07:34,700 --> 02:07:37,731
technology.
I'm hoping we're going to give up our 

2652
02:07:37,731 --> 02:07:37,731
bullshit

2653
02:07:37,731 --> 02:07:41,290
biological memory for a fat SD card.
They stick in the back of your head.

2654
02:07:41,590 --> 02:07:46,590
Just pop that sucker in there and look 
and you'll have all of your memories 

2655
02:07:46,590 --> 02:07:48,170
entirely accurate.
Like a.

2656
02:07:48,250 --> 02:07:52,180
That was a black mirror episode says 
motherfuckers are on top of everything.

2657
02:07:52,181 --> 02:07:57,181
They know everything,
but I really think that that's entirely 

2658
02:07:57,181 --> 02:07:59,431
possible in the future that there's 
going to be some way we have a neural 

2659
02:07:59,431 --> 02:08:01,630
interface with some sort of recording 
device.

2660
02:08:01,631 --> 02:08:05,500
It's far more accurate and that we'll 
all agree to it.

2661
02:08:05,710 --> 02:08:08,080
We'll all agree to.
It's just like photographs,

2662
02:08:08,110 --> 02:08:13,110
like if Jamie is standing next to you 
and I say Jamie and Mick West,

2663
02:08:13,961 --> 02:08:15,310
we're in the room together and take a 
picture.

2664
02:08:15,700 --> 02:08:18,880
It used to be that I could say,
well that's definite because I have this

2665
02:08:18,881 --> 02:08:22,180
photo,
but now with photoshop and video editing

2666
02:08:22,181 --> 02:08:24,310
tools,
so even then,

2667
02:08:24,340 --> 02:08:26,200
so what am I talking about?
Because even in your memory,

2668
02:08:26,210 --> 02:08:29,090
these are going to go create our visual 
intelligence,

2669
02:08:29,720 --> 02:08:31,370
brightening,
creating memories for you.

2670
02:08:31,450 --> 02:08:33,490
Well there wasn't that like a total 
recall,

2671
02:08:33,550 --> 02:08:35,530
right?
It wasn't that part of the idea of total

2672
02:08:35,531 --> 02:08:40,531
recall.
They could put you put like fake 

2673
02:08:40,531 --> 02:08:42,760
memories in your brain and have you have
fake experiences.

2674
02:08:43,270 --> 02:08:48,270
There's a lot of experiences that I had 
that award gigantic to me like all of my

2675
02:08:48,821 --> 02:08:53,821
years of martial arts competition.
If you had asked me to like accurately 

2676
02:08:54,820 --> 02:08:59,820
depict some of the most significant 
memories of my life from age 16 to 21,

2677
02:09:01,660 --> 02:09:03,520
like all those martial arts fights that 
I had,

2678
02:09:03,700 --> 02:09:05,800
I wouldn't even be able to touch it.
I have,

2679
02:09:06,460 --> 02:09:08,410
I've zero.
I've scrapped.

2680
02:09:08,450 --> 02:09:10,030
I've like flashes.

2681
02:09:10,140 --> 02:09:15,140
Yeah.
I was starting to figure out all this 

2682
02:09:15,140 --> 02:09:16,601
stuff.
I didn't never soft when I was working 

2683
02:09:16,601 --> 02:09:16,601
on Sandy Hook.
Like I just got interviewed for the,

2684
02:09:16,601 --> 02:09:21,030
doing a documentary about the making 
well about the history of Neversoft and 

2685
02:09:21,030 --> 02:09:22,350
Tony Hawk and the guy's interviewing me 
and I'm like,

2686
02:09:22,650 --> 02:09:25,920
I kind of remember it was like somebody 
is like 20 years ago,

2687
02:09:26,070 --> 02:09:31,070
but it's that type of thing that I 
thought I would never forget that 

2688
02:09:31,070 --> 02:09:32,820
because it was such a significant part 
of my life,

2689
02:09:32,850 --> 02:09:35,520
but it's just kind of dropping away over
the years.

2690
02:09:36,030 --> 02:09:37,740
Anything that happens a lot with the,
you know,

2691
02:09:37,890 --> 02:09:42,890
people are looking back on nine slash 11
and going by the memories of what 

2692
02:09:42,890 --> 02:09:45,600
happened that day and it changes your 
memory changes.

2693
02:09:45,780 --> 02:09:46,280
Yeah,
I will,

2694
02:09:46,310 --> 02:09:51,310
I will.
There's a few things that I remember 

2695
02:09:51,310 --> 02:09:51,310
because there like some significance to 
it.

2696
02:09:51,510 --> 02:09:56,510
Like I remember the space shuttle thing 
because I was over at an ex girlfriend's

2697
02:09:57,061 --> 02:10:02,061
house and it was one of the few times 
that we saw each other before we had 

2698
02:10:02,061 --> 02:10:04,680
completely stopped seeing each other,
like we had kind of broken up and then I

2699
02:10:04,710 --> 02:10:08,370
drove out to her house to visit her and 
then while I was over at house,

2700
02:10:08,371 --> 02:10:09,960
we saw the launch.
We were like,

2701
02:10:09,961 --> 02:10:11,220
Holy Shit,
we,

2702
02:10:11,240 --> 02:10:12,480
we,
we actually saw the

2703
02:10:12,740 --> 02:10:15,800
play of it blowing up and were like,
Whoa,

2704
02:10:15,860 --> 02:10:19,040
like this is fucked.
See some people say that replay and then

2705
02:10:19,041 --> 02:10:21,290
they remember that to seeing the actual 
event,

2706
02:10:21,340 --> 02:10:23,810
so why?
And so they think they saw right live.

2707
02:10:24,100 --> 02:10:25,190
So that becomes a memory.

2708
02:10:25,340 --> 02:10:27,920
I'm pretty,
pretty good at that.

2709
02:10:28,040 --> 02:10:33,040
I'm pretty.
I'm pretty good at going over my 

2710
02:10:33,040 --> 02:10:33,040
memories to make sure that I'm thinking,
yeah,

2711
02:10:33,040 --> 02:10:33,970
you think maybe you're not.

2712
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:36,290
Maybe you shouldn't go back and check 
some of these memories of Tom,

2713
02:10:36,330 --> 02:10:39,800
Tom and your ex girlfriend and asked her
if that really happened.

2714
02:10:39,890 --> 02:10:43,070
I remember very clearly where I was when
Sam Kennison died.

2715
02:10:44,430 --> 02:10:46,910
I remember definitely where I was when 
nine slash 11 happened.

2716
02:10:47,130 --> 02:10:52,130
Yeah,
because I got some calls from friends 

2717
02:10:52,130 --> 02:10:54,220
and they woke me up.
My phone kept ringing and I remember 

2718
02:10:54,220 --> 02:10:54,220
that because I remember being in my 
house.

2719
02:10:54,220 --> 02:10:56,780
I remember turning on the TV.
That's 100 percent.

2720
02:10:56,870 --> 02:10:58,640
I was driving to work.
I was on the floor of five,

2721
02:10:58,850 --> 02:11:01,280
so I remember that.
It seems to be very solidly,

2722
02:11:01,310 --> 02:11:04,550
but seems there are details around that.
Like I remember I went to,

2723
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:10,000
I went to Taco bell on the way to get 
some food because I thought it might be 

2724
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,630
a long day now as the.
How much is enough to get dental care.

2725
02:11:12,650 --> 02:11:17,650
Remember now I went to a gas station.
I think I went to Taco Bell.

2726
02:11:18,970 --> 02:11:21,200
Dang.
Now I'm starting to forget what happened

2727
02:11:21,201 --> 02:11:23,180
on nine slash 11.
I remember the day

2728
02:11:23,250 --> 02:11:28,250
because I spent it with uh,
Eddie and Joey Diaz and a couple other 

2729
02:11:28,250 --> 02:11:29,530
friends of mine.
We went to the,

2730
02:11:29,960 --> 02:11:34,960
went to a burrito joint on sunset in 
Hollywood and we were just talking about

2731
02:11:37,271 --> 02:11:42,271
how there's no flights like look,
because we'd heard that the flight tend 

2732
02:11:42,271 --> 02:11:42,271
to like,
look man,

2733
02:11:42,271 --> 02:11:42,630
you see a plane.
This guy's weird.

2734
02:11:43,110 --> 02:11:45,630
It felt weird.
We felt like we're stuck in California.

2735
02:11:46,070 --> 02:11:51,070
Whereas the freedom of air travels,
it's something that if you don't fly a 

2736
02:11:51,070 --> 02:11:51,900
lot you don't think about.
But if you,

2737
02:11:51,990 --> 02:11:54,180
if you really do,
if they pull it away,

2738
02:11:54,580 --> 02:11:55,830
there's no more air travel.
Like what?

2739
02:11:56,170 --> 02:11:59,930
We're stuck here,
how long it take to drive to Colorado to

2740
02:11:59,970 --> 02:12:03,390
that 16 hours and shit.
Like you don't think about it going back

2741
02:12:03,391 --> 02:12:05,370
in time in a way.
Different Times.

2742
02:12:05,450 --> 02:12:10,450
Yeah.
Well at least you have cars say the 

2743
02:12:10,450 --> 02:12:10,450
train.
Yeah.

2744
02:12:10,450 --> 02:12:11,180
So is there anything else that we,
um,

2745
02:12:11,520 --> 02:12:13,620
we might disagree on?
Hm,

2746
02:12:13,890 --> 02:12:14,880
let me disagree with.

2747
02:12:16,240 --> 02:12:18,540
I know what,
uh,

2748
02:12:19,870 --> 02:12:24,870
I think we,
I think we agree on the flat earth 

2749
02:12:24,870 --> 02:12:24,870
stuff.
Uh,

2750
02:12:24,870 --> 02:12:24,870
no.
You think the earth is round,

2751
02:12:24,870 --> 02:12:27,250
right?
What about a changed my tune.

2752
02:12:27,340 --> 02:12:31,370
What about did long Matt Delong?
The,

2753
02:12:32,680 --> 02:12:35,110
the guy who from blink one eight,
two.

2754
02:12:35,300 --> 02:12:36,160
Oh Tom.
Tom,

2755
02:12:36,190 --> 02:12:37,030
Tom Delonge.
Oh,

2756
02:12:37,031 --> 02:12:38,560
he's out of his fucking mind,
right man.

2757
02:12:38,561 --> 02:12:40,540
People's bastard.
Yeah.

2758
02:12:40,541 --> 02:12:45,541
He's um,
he's got some weird shit going on and 

2759
02:12:45,541 --> 02:12:46,030
since that podcast,
a bunch of people have pointed out to me

2760
02:12:46,031 --> 02:12:51,031
that he is essentially,
they are selling stock in a competence.

2761
02:12:52,510 --> 02:12:57,510
Yeah.
The suddenly stuck and also he gets a 

2762
02:12:57,510 --> 02:12:57,510
guarantee pay out.
Yeah.

2763
02:12:57,510 --> 02:12:58,030
Oh,
like I think $100,000

2764
02:12:58,031 --> 02:12:59,680
a year or something like that.
Well,

2765
02:12:59,740 --> 02:13:04,740
whatever it goes,
how much money they take in what they 

2766
02:13:04,740 --> 02:13:06,580
make.
If you get enough rubes to keep donating

2767
02:13:06,581 --> 02:13:10,000
money to this.
It mean he keeps saying stay tuned.

2768
02:13:10,030 --> 02:13:15,030
Things are gonna happen.
And I said there's gonna be some videos 

2769
02:13:15,030 --> 02:13:15,030
released.
Yeah,

2770
02:13:15,030 --> 02:13:16,600
like nearly a month ago now.
I think dude,

2771
02:13:16,601 --> 02:13:21,601
when he was on the podcast,
he played some videos for us that were 

2772
02:13:21,601 --> 02:13:22,600
like absolutely ufos.
And I almost pissed my pants laughing.

2773
02:13:22,930 --> 02:13:25,360
They were so bad.
It was so bad.

2774
02:13:25,361 --> 02:13:27,430
One of them was so fucking bad.
I was like,

2775
02:13:27,431 --> 02:13:32,431
dude,
if that was in a movie I would want my 

2776
02:13:32,431 --> 02:13:32,431
money back.
I'd be angry.

2777
02:13:32,431 --> 02:13:32,431
So like,
what do you mean easy?

2778
02:13:32,431 --> 02:13:37,301
A crazy guy,
or is he a smart guy who was making 

2779
02:13:37,301 --> 02:13:37,320
money?
I do not know.

2780
02:13:37,380 --> 02:13:38,850
I think it must.
It must like this,

2781
02:13:38,930 --> 02:13:42,840
this ufo stuff he loves,
so I stay saying I'm making money,

2782
02:13:43,470 --> 02:13:48,470
but the conversation I look,
there's two ways to approach this and I 

2783
02:13:48,470 --> 02:13:51,360
tried to be district.
I tried to be respectful because I'm the

2784
02:13:51,361 --> 02:13:54,870
host and he agreed to come here and he 
wanted to talk about this so I'll try to

2785
02:13:54,871 --> 02:13:59,871
be respectful and let this guy talk and 
what he was saying to me was so 

2786
02:14:00,721 --> 02:14:02,430
ridiculous.
I was like,

2787
02:14:02,460 --> 02:14:07,460
I don't even have to challenge him on 
this because it's so obviously 

2788
02:14:07,460 --> 02:14:07,460
ridiculous.

2789
02:14:07,460 --> 02:14:09,090
Everyone is going to see that.
It's ridiculous.

2790
02:14:09,960 --> 02:14:14,960
I was wrong.
There was a lot of people that listened 

2791
02:14:14,960 --> 02:14:15,930
to that podcast that I saw on twitter 
that thought that what he was saying was

2792
02:14:15,931 --> 02:14:20,931
mind blowing and this is real.
Those are the people that are going to 

2793
02:14:20,931 --> 02:14:21,870
donate.
He exactly right.

2794
02:14:22,110 --> 02:14:23,370
Now,
is there a problem with that?

2795
02:14:24,720 --> 02:14:29,720
Is there a problem with the Catholic 
church because they're full of shit too.

2796
02:14:31,300 --> 02:14:32,280
You know what I'm saying?
I mean,

2797
02:14:32,640 --> 02:14:37,640
Catholic churches essentially a 
moneymaking franchise and they don't 

2798
02:14:37,640 --> 02:14:37,830
have to pay taxes.
At least he has to pay taxes.

2799
02:14:37,831 --> 02:14:39,110
I mean,
is there a.

2800
02:14:39,250 --> 02:14:42,630
is there a problem with conning rubes 
out of money?

2801
02:14:42,750 --> 02:14:45,300
There's loads of kickstarter's a 
technology,

2802
02:14:45,301 --> 02:14:47,960
things that just could never work like 
those days,

2803
02:14:48,020 --> 02:14:53,020
like clearer holograms.
They say you'll get to play video games 

2804
02:14:53,020 --> 02:14:53,020
on the table in front of you.
Oh yeah.

2805
02:14:53,020 --> 02:14:55,940
There's a go fund me's for people that 
don't have illnesses that.

2806
02:14:56,180 --> 02:15:01,180
Yeah,
there's like one way that they had a 

2807
02:15:01,180 --> 02:15:01,470
water bottle,
it would magically take water out of the

2808
02:15:01,471 --> 02:15:01,940
uh,
uh,

2809
02:15:01,941 --> 02:15:02,920
saw that one.
Yeah.

2810
02:15:02,940 --> 02:15:07,940
But it doesn't actually work.
It would take like three days to fill 

2811
02:15:07,940 --> 02:15:09,410
the bottle.
If you were in a rain forest anyway,

2812
02:15:09,940 --> 02:15:12,430
require like a solar panel list,
like this big,

2813
02:15:12,700 --> 02:15:15,060
it's just easy to bring,
bring your in.

2814
02:15:15,260 --> 02:15:20,260
But they raised like $2,000,000.
And what do they have to do with that 

2815
02:15:20,260 --> 02:15:20,260
money?
They're allowed to keep it.

2816
02:15:20,260 --> 02:15:23,310
They can keep it.
If they went to the kickstarter.

2817
02:15:23,630 --> 02:15:28,630
Kickstarter has this open thing where 
you're developing a prototype so it 

2818
02:15:29,371 --> 02:15:32,220
doesn't actually have to work.
Wow.

2819
02:15:32,250 --> 02:15:35,680
So what happens with that?
So all those people is this it us?

2820
02:15:35,740 --> 02:15:40,740
Yeah,
and I think they might've like Gogo 

2821
02:15:40,740 --> 02:15:45,141
though.
They might've been on a couple of 

2822
02:15:45,141 --> 02:15:46,791
different platforms and one of them is 
more a more relaxed than the other in 

2823
02:15:47,191 --> 02:15:48,300
terms of what it will allow.

2824
02:15:48,320 --> 02:15:50,550
Like one of them now you could have a 
working prototype.

2825
02:15:50,780 --> 02:15:52,850
The self filling water bottle.
Yeah.

2826
02:15:53,060 --> 02:15:56,130
It's bullshit.
Compulsively go created it.

2827
02:15:56,270 --> 02:16:01,270
Yeah.
A lot of these eastern European 

2828
02:16:01,270 --> 02:16:02,610
scientists types who do things like 
this.

2829
02:16:02,640 --> 02:16:07,640
So they made it look like this dude's 
just driving around and then this sense 

2830
02:16:07,640 --> 02:16:11,410
of pull it out of air and then he can 
just pull it out of the tube and wow,

2831
02:16:11,551 --> 02:16:13,050
look,
I've got water all of a sudden.

2832
02:16:13,270 --> 02:16:15,780
Yeah.
It can't possibly work.

2833
02:16:15,810 --> 02:16:16,320
It,
it,

2834
02:16:16,650 --> 02:16:21,650
it uses a real technology,
like these little electrical things 

2835
02:16:21,650 --> 02:16:25,970
actually cool things down and condense 
things and it will actually condense a 

2836
02:16:25,970 --> 02:16:26,490
little bit,
but hardly anything.

2837
02:16:26,970 --> 02:16:31,150
So we'd take a long ass time for to fill
was basically a dehumidifier.

2838
02:16:31,210 --> 02:16:33,730
I don't know if you have like a,
like a dehumidifier.

2839
02:16:33,960 --> 02:16:35,740
The,
the every humidifier.

2840
02:16:35,770 --> 02:16:38,320
Because California's drought,
he ever have a dehumidifier,

2841
02:16:38,440 --> 02:16:41,260
it will eventually fill up the container
of the dehumidifier,

2842
02:16:41,261 --> 02:16:46,261
but this is this thing powered by 
plugging it into the wall and it's this 

2843
02:16:46,261 --> 02:16:46,540
big machine and it still takes all day 
to fill up the reservoir.

2844
02:16:47,050 --> 02:16:52,050
So they're saying like a little water 
bottle this size with a little solar 

2845
02:16:52,050 --> 02:16:53,200
panel and this little condensing thing 
that's this big.

2846
02:16:53,201 --> 02:16:58,201
We'll fill it up in a few hours.
Well maybe it's like physically 

2847
02:16:58,201 --> 02:17:02,461
impossible physical face technology 
swapping thing like 20 years ago it was 

2848
02:17:02,461 --> 02:17:06,811
impossible,
but 20 years from now they're playing 

2849
02:17:06,811 --> 02:17:06,811
the long game.
We can water bottle,

2850
02:17:06,811 --> 02:17:09,130
you can improve computers,
but you can't really improve the laws of

2851
02:17:09,131 --> 02:17:14,131
physics.
You can only get so much water out of 

2852
02:17:14,131 --> 02:17:15,950
the parcel parcel of uh,
so they would have to have some sort of 

2853
02:17:15,950 --> 02:17:17,140
better mechanism for extracting it than 
what they're doing.

2854
02:17:18,150 --> 02:17:18,530
Yeah.
There's,

2855
02:17:18,580 --> 02:17:20,770
I mean there's certainly a lot of scams 
out there.

2856
02:17:20,771 --> 02:17:25,771
I don't know if that's what he's doing.
When I talked to people that knew him 

2857
02:17:25,771 --> 02:17:28,600
from a long time ago,
he's been obsessed with Ufo is forever.

2858
02:17:28,810 --> 02:17:31,570
So his obsession seems to be legitimate.
However,

2859
02:17:31,571 --> 02:17:34,120
when I was talking to him about all the 
events and I was like,

2860
02:17:34,121 --> 02:17:36,850
tell me what happened.
You gotta a guy contacted you.

2861
02:17:36,851 --> 02:17:39,580
While I can't say who I can't say,
I can't say what it was,

2862
02:17:39,820 --> 02:17:41,440
I can't tell you that we can't get into 
that.

2863
02:17:41,650 --> 02:17:44,380
That's all bullshit.
When someone starts talking like that,

2864
02:17:44,381 --> 02:17:45,300
they're full of shit.
He,

2865
02:17:45,520 --> 02:17:50,380
he definitely seemed to be a combination
of deceptive and delusional.

2866
02:17:50,790 --> 02:17:51,190
Well,
the,

2867
02:17:52,170 --> 02:17:57,170
the slides that he used in the talk to 
illustrate there was an event of some 

2868
02:17:58,261 --> 02:18:01,440
Ufo buzzing a aircraft carrier and some 
fighter jets.

2869
02:18:01,441 --> 02:18:06,441
We're going after it and they couldn't 
find it and they put up some slides on 

2870
02:18:06,441 --> 02:18:09,300
the screen there which looked like a 
shiny silver penis flying around.

2871
02:18:10,390 --> 02:18:13,770
And it was actually something that type 
of thing we do on metal bunks,

2872
02:18:13,780 --> 02:18:16,680
identify objects like that.
So we figured out what this was and it's

2873
02:18:16,681 --> 02:18:20,310
actually a,
a number one numerical helium balloon,

2874
02:18:20,790 --> 02:18:23,790
like the digit one.
Oh Wow.

2875
02:18:23,820 --> 02:18:28,820
Like someone's like from a party.
And I found like a bunch of other shots 

2876
02:18:28,820 --> 02:18:32,301
of the same thing where you can see it 
rotating and you can see it's fairly 

2877
02:18:32,301 --> 02:18:32,301
clear.
It's this number one,

2878
02:18:32,301 --> 02:18:33,050
but it's on this,
um,

2879
02:18:33,480 --> 02:18:34,230
this,
this,

2880
02:18:34,610 --> 02:18:36,270
uh,
conspiracy website.

2881
02:18:36,271 --> 02:18:38,190
They thought it was a Ufo.
So he got it off that.

2882
02:18:38,190 --> 02:18:40,920
And so this is a Ufo took the image,
kind of degraded a bit.

2883
02:18:40,921 --> 02:18:45,921
So you can't reach out to where it was.
It was quite hard for me to track it 

2884
02:18:45,921 --> 02:18:46,570
down because he'd mess with it so much.
It was actually just this,

2885
02:18:46,640 --> 02:18:50,040
this helium balloon that was a white 
shiny.

2886
02:18:50,370 --> 02:18:55,370
What's disturbing to me is that he's got
this business that claims to be some 

2887
02:18:56,701 --> 02:19:01,701
sort of aerospace business and he's 
involved in it with all these other 

2888
02:19:01,701 --> 02:19:01,950
people.
It's weird because the guy who's running

2889
02:19:01,951 --> 02:19:05,310
that a can't remember his name for 
fortune or something like that,

2890
02:19:05,670 --> 02:19:10,670
is like a real guy who worked at 
Lockheed Martin or somewhere and the 

2891
02:19:10,670 --> 02:19:14,310
skunkworks amy started doing adderall,
started getting crazy.

2892
02:19:14,600 --> 02:19:17,130
Know what he's talking about.
It makes no sense whatsoever.

2893
02:19:17,131 --> 02:19:22,131
He says,
our mission is to take what the science 

2894
02:19:22,131 --> 02:19:23,790
division gives us and we'll turn that 
science into flying craft.

2895
02:19:23,980 --> 02:19:26,040
Right.
But at the science division does.

2896
02:19:26,100 --> 02:19:27,980
It doesn't really.
Right.

2897
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:33,010
They've got like a guy who's like one 
guy who was interested in like shooting 

2898
02:19:33,010 --> 02:19:34,430
a things with lasers to make them go 
fast.

2899
02:19:34,820 --> 02:19:36,480
Yeah.
That was one of the weird things.

2900
02:19:36,530 --> 02:19:38,480
We're not just talking,
I'm just gonna have a real technology.

2901
02:19:38,481 --> 02:19:41,600
You can use a laser to power power of 
craft,

2902
02:19:41,630 --> 02:19:43,010
but yeah,
that's not what they're talking about.

2903
02:19:43,011 --> 02:19:45,590
That talking about some kind of crap.
The wolves,

2904
02:19:45,591 --> 02:19:50,591
the very nature of time and space itself
to kind of ride rides a wave of a.

2905
02:19:51,311 --> 02:19:53,760
we're a wormhole or something like that.
Yeah,

2906
02:19:54,010 --> 02:19:59,010
and this guy thinks that it's plausible 
and only have to do is kind of like try 

2907
02:19:59,010 --> 02:19:59,010
really,
really hard.

2908
02:19:59,030 --> 02:20:04,030
If they put their heads together and 
like this scientists who all this 

2909
02:20:04,030 --> 02:20:05,960
science a lot and then these builders do
that really good building based on these

2910
02:20:05,961 --> 02:20:07,340
really good science they're going to 
get.

2911
02:20:07,341 --> 02:20:12,341
Then they'll,
they'll get this flying craft Johnson's 

2912
02:20:12,341 --> 02:20:12,341
nothing's going to happen.
It hasn't.

2913
02:20:12,470 --> 02:20:15,890
Having people donated some something 
like $2,000,000

2914
02:20:15,891 --> 02:20:19,310
or something goofy like that.
How many fucking people have done that?

2915
02:20:19,860 --> 02:20:24,700
See if you can find that out to 2000.
90 two people have donated

2916
02:20:24,710 --> 02:20:25,580
$2,000,000.
Yeah.

2917
02:20:26,300 --> 02:20:28,070
Wow.
So that's a thousand dollars each.

2918
02:20:28,100 --> 02:20:30,020
That's a lie.
That seems wrong.

2919
02:20:30,570 --> 02:20:33,790
I know the numbers,
the numbers have changed frequently.

2920
02:20:33,950 --> 02:20:38,950
Well,
the numbers seemed really high in terms 

2921
02:20:38,950 --> 02:20:38,950
of the amount of donations.
Like it's very odd.

2922
02:20:38,950 --> 02:20:42,410
You're going to get 2000 people to 
donate a thousand dollars each.

2923
02:20:42,411 --> 02:20:45,550
That doesn't seem right.
It could be a few very large donors that

2924
02:20:45,551 --> 02:20:50,551
is somehow convinced to donate via this.
There are a lot of really fucking crazy 

2925
02:20:51,291 --> 02:20:55,520
old people that believe in this shit and
they might have a ton of money.

2926
02:20:55,730 --> 02:20:58,000
What do you mean?
What's that red line meant to represent?

2927
02:20:58,040 --> 02:21:03,040
Kind of looks like they're flying right 
about the stars.

2928
02:21:05,570 --> 02:21:08,060
Academy of Arts and science.
That's what kills me.

2929
02:21:08,061 --> 02:21:08,990
What kind of arts?
What are you doing?

2930
02:21:08,991 --> 02:21:09,530
Fingerprint.

2931
02:21:09,920 --> 02:21:14,920
I'm always tracking those numbers for 
awhile and they were going up 

2932
02:21:14,920 --> 02:21:17,770
proportionately.
If that's the correct word to say from 

2933
02:21:17,770 --> 02:21:19,901
each other.
The one that number was going up while 

2934
02:21:19,901 --> 02:21:22,961
the number,
the dollar number was sort of staying 

2935
02:21:22,961 --> 02:21:22,961
the same,

2936
02:21:22,961 --> 02:21:24,490
so maybe he was calling these people if 
you double your off,

2937
02:21:24,491 --> 02:21:29,491
getting a lot of people on the first 
ship submitted Mo of 200 I think really 

2938
02:21:29,870 --> 02:21:32,000
sound this bold,
bold print down the.

2939
02:21:32,350 --> 02:21:37,350
So some large donations.
It's amazing though to still pretty 

2940
02:21:37,350 --> 02:21:38,980
large.
Donated $2,000,000

2941
02:21:39,490 --> 02:21:41,560
to this wacky ass fucking company.
Yeah,

2942
02:21:41,561 --> 02:21:44,860
and Ole.
All the company is required to do is pay

2943
02:21:44,861 --> 02:21:49,861
delong $100,000
a year for the next seven years or 

2944
02:21:49,861 --> 02:21:52,650
something and that's it.
Really.

2945
02:21:52,660 --> 02:21:57,660
The crazy thing too is that they,
that he had been contacted by the 

2946
02:21:57,660 --> 02:22:01,351
government because they knew that he 
could go on shows like mine and talk 

2947
02:22:01,351 --> 02:22:05,431
about this.
Then he would have a platform because 

2948
02:22:05,431 --> 02:22:05,431
he's a rockstar.
I was like,

2949
02:22:05,431 --> 02:22:06,480
what?
This is like some.

2950
02:22:06,820 --> 02:22:11,050
Why didn't they stop him?
This is some bad movie shit.

2951
02:22:11,710 --> 02:22:15,670
Like this narrative is like a bad movie 
is that people like say they didn't want

2952
02:22:15,671 --> 02:22:20,671
to talk to me on the phone because 
they're afraid of the government 

2953
02:22:20,671 --> 02:22:20,860
tracking them down and assassinating 
them or whatever.

2954
02:22:21,400 --> 02:22:24,280
It's like I'm talking to you on 
facebook.

2955
02:22:26,300 --> 02:22:27,190
Well,
yeah,

2956
02:22:27,270 --> 02:22:29,200
if I really was like this,
you know,

2957
02:22:29,490 --> 02:22:32,010
agents of the government,
it wouldn't be very hard to just say,

2958
02:22:32,011 --> 02:22:32,480
yeah,
get,

2959
02:22:32,580 --> 02:22:33,960
get rid of this guy.
That's a big one.

2960
02:22:33,961 --> 02:22:36,300
They like to pull on you because you 
debunk things.

2961
02:22:36,380 --> 02:22:38,970
You're an agent of the government.
Yeah.

2962
02:22:39,570 --> 02:22:41,160
Yeah,
and it's really hard one to get around.

2963
02:22:41,161 --> 02:22:42,800
I think that the,
my approach there,

2964
02:22:42,810 --> 02:22:45,210
I was just to be as honest as possible 
all the time,

2965
02:22:45,450 --> 02:22:47,620
so I always tell them exactly who I am.
Like that.

2966
02:22:47,630 --> 02:22:50,070
I made lots of money during the Tony 
Hawk video games.

2967
02:22:50,071 --> 02:22:52,290
I'm just like British video game 
programmer.

2968
02:22:53,340 --> 02:22:56,580
Basically my life story,
they don't buy it.

2969
02:22:56,730 --> 02:22:58,650
They don't buy in it pal.
They don't.

2970
02:22:58,651 --> 02:23:00,020
But yeah,
I think some of them it,

2971
02:23:00,080 --> 02:23:03,420
it helps telling them about the.
About Tony Hawk.

2972
02:23:03,590 --> 02:23:08,590
Yeah.
It's a lot of them actually are fans of 

2973
02:23:08,590 --> 02:23:08,590
Tony Hall and that's funny actually.

2974
02:23:08,880 --> 02:23:09,810
Well,
it's,

2975
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:15,000
it's one of those things where if you 
don't want to believe you're not going 

2976
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:18,531
to,
you're gonna like that's a likely cover 

2977
02:23:18,531 --> 02:23:18,531
story for a guy and then then they'll go
super deep.

2978
02:23:18,720 --> 02:23:23,720
Oh,
the government has infiltrated video 

2979
02:23:23,720 --> 02:23:25,221
games in order to keep kids stupid.
They've created these games in order to 

2980
02:23:25,221 --> 02:23:29,160
mess with the kids' minds.
And one reaction I get quite a bit is 

2981
02:23:29,160 --> 02:23:29,160
the,
I am stupid.

2982
02:23:29,290 --> 02:23:30,120
You're stupid.
Yeah.

2983
02:23:30,121 --> 02:23:32,100
A lot of people will say that I am 
really stupid.

2984
02:23:32,530 --> 02:23:35,090
Those people like who were in like,
you know,

2985
02:23:35,140 --> 02:23:40,140
the architects and engineers when nine 
slash 11 truth type thing who think the 

2986
02:23:40,140 --> 02:23:40,650
time really stupid and don't understand 
physics at all.

2987
02:23:41,190 --> 02:23:45,240
And so that they say that,
but I'm not a government agent.

2988
02:23:45,570 --> 02:23:50,570
I'm just this really stupid dude who 
doesn't understand what actually 

2989
02:23:50,570 --> 02:23:50,880
happened in nine slash 11 useful idiot.

2990
02:23:50,880 --> 02:23:51,840
Right?
Yeah.

2991
02:23:51,860 --> 02:23:54,360
Uh,
and not just in the useful idiot in that

2992
02:23:54,361 --> 02:23:56,250
sense,
but a person who,

2993
02:23:56,940 --> 02:23:58,590
uh,
is just mistaken.

2994
02:23:58,850 --> 02:24:03,850
Right.
Is it just so then they can dismiss my 

2995
02:24:03,850 --> 02:24:05,751
videos by laughing at them,
like I do lots of little videos where I 

2996
02:24:05,751 --> 02:24:07,020
do things like demonstrate how something
buckles,

2997
02:24:07,050 --> 02:24:12,050
like a column buckling when you put a 
load on it or you think things like 

2998
02:24:12,841 --> 02:24:17,841
that,
just just physics videos and then they 

2999
02:24:17,841 --> 02:24:17,841
just say,
yeah,

3000
02:24:17,841 --> 02:24:17,841
you're an idiot.
We don't need to look at this video.

3001
02:24:18,400 --> 02:24:23,400
So it's a way of getting around the 
problem and a lot of other people say 

3002
02:24:23,400 --> 02:24:27,351
that I'm so smart about chem trails and 
things like that that I must be a 

3003
02:24:27,351 --> 02:24:27,640
government agent because I know so much 
about contrarian,

3004
02:24:28,350 --> 02:24:33,350
so I get both sides of and why they're 
really smart government agent or I'm 

3005
02:24:33,350 --> 02:24:33,990
just a stupid,
a useful idiot.

3006
02:24:34,140 --> 02:24:39,140
Well it's just them looking at you and 
trying to find some way to dismiss what 

3007
02:24:39,140 --> 02:24:39,240
you're saying,
but you,

3008
02:24:39,270 --> 02:24:41,580
you really get a kick out of debunking 
shit.

3009
02:24:41,880 --> 02:24:46,880
I do span the backyard science stuff.
There was a thing I did recently where 

3010
02:24:47,641 --> 02:24:48,850
A.
Yeah,

3011
02:24:48,900 --> 02:24:52,350
so the scientists were saying that the 
bits falling off the world trade center,

3012
02:24:52,351 --> 02:24:54,510
we're leaving trails.
That must be fraud.

3013
02:24:54,511 --> 02:24:57,630
And the rocket motors that are pushing 
them away from the World Trade Center.

3014
02:24:58,080 --> 02:25:01,400
So I said now he's probably just some 
some dust on it and they say no,

3015
02:25:01,401 --> 02:25:03,150
I wouldn't do that.
He wouldn't live a long trail.

3016
02:25:03,390 --> 02:25:08,390
So I got a big sledgehammer and I piled 
some some ashes on it from my fireplace.

3017
02:25:08,551 --> 02:25:13,551
And then I stood on top of a wall and I 
was throwing this sledgehammer with a 

3018
02:25:13,551 --> 02:25:17,421
big trailer.
Dust is coming from it for like half an 

3019
02:25:17,421 --> 02:25:17,421
hour videoing myself doing it until I 
got some of the,

3020
02:25:17,490 --> 02:25:20,550
some representative videos of it.
It's just fun to do.

3021
02:25:20,760 --> 02:25:22,110
It is kind of fun.
You know,

3022
02:25:22,111 --> 02:25:23,680
one of the ones that kept up

3023
02:25:24,460 --> 02:25:29,460
that I thought was the most ridiculous 
thing about the flat earth was I read 

3024
02:25:29,460 --> 02:25:33,301
this a couple of places where people are
talking about ships disappearing on the 

3025
02:25:33,301 --> 02:25:35,230
horizon and then the ship disappeared.
But if you pulled out,

3026
02:25:35,231 --> 02:25:38,080
if you zoom in,
you can still see the ship.

3027
02:25:38,140 --> 02:25:39,010
Yeah.
And I was like,

3028
02:25:39,011 --> 02:25:44,011
well,
how come you can't see Mount Everest 

3029
02:25:44,011 --> 02:25:44,011
motherfucker?
Why can't you look towards Japan?

3030
02:25:44,011 --> 02:25:45,100
Where's Mt Kilimanjaro?
Get up.

3031
02:25:45,310 --> 02:25:47,890
How come you can see the moon?
You could see the moon.

3032
02:25:47,891 --> 02:25:50,290
If you get a good telescope,
you could see the moon really clearly.

3033
02:25:50,291 --> 02:25:53,020
Take that telescope.
Don't point at the moon point across the

3034
02:25:53,021 --> 02:25:54,760
ocean.
Where's the mountains?

3035
02:25:55,250 --> 02:26:00,250
The atmosphere that the kind of advanced
special.

3036
02:26:00,811 --> 02:26:05,811
You know,
I was talking about how not architects 

3037
02:26:05,811 --> 02:26:07,411
and engineers when nine slash 11 have to
do this really I'd punch thing now 

3038
02:26:07,411 --> 02:26:08,470
because we've debunked the basic stuff 
so they can move to this advanced stuff.

3039
02:26:08,920 --> 02:26:11,950
Same thing with the flat earth people.
Now they can.

3040
02:26:12,010 --> 02:26:17,010
You demonstrate how things actually do 
go over the horizon and we're going to 

3041
02:26:17,010 --> 02:26:20,931
do get obscured by the horizon and how 
the sunsets and things like that and so 

3042
02:26:20,931 --> 02:26:25,321
they come up with a complicated 
explanation where there's this kind of 

3043
02:26:25,321 --> 02:26:28,141
giant,
a refractive lens of atmosphere above 

3044
02:26:28,141 --> 02:26:31,951
the earth,
which is bending all the light from the 

3045
02:26:31,951 --> 02:26:34,651
sun in such a way that the earth appears
to be round even though he's actually 

3046
02:26:35,261 --> 02:26:36,340
flat.
Don Don,

3047
02:26:36,341 --> 02:26:39,700
Don,
which kind of begs the question like,

3048
02:26:39,701 --> 02:26:41,980
how do they actually know it's round?
If it looks,

3049
02:26:42,010 --> 02:26:44,900
how do they know it's flat?
If it looks round right,

3050
02:26:45,660 --> 02:26:48,400
like yeah,
things are disappearing over the horizon

3051
02:26:48,490 --> 02:26:52,090
as if it looks round because of this 
refraction thing,

3052
02:26:53,040 --> 02:26:56,050
but they think it's flat,
but if it looks round,

3053
02:26:56,051 --> 02:26:58,900
why are they thinking explant?
Well,

3054
02:26:58,901 --> 02:27:02,680
the thing that killed me was that you 
could zoom in on it and that proved that

3055
02:27:02,681 --> 02:27:07,681
the,
that it wasn't actually disappearing 

3056
02:27:07,681 --> 02:27:07,681
over the horizon.

3057
02:27:07,681 --> 02:27:11,070
I know a little bit about optics because
of my fascination with the outdoors.

3058
02:27:12,401 --> 02:27:15,430
I have a bunch of binoculars spotting 
scopes,

3059
02:27:15,431 --> 02:27:20,431
various power,
and there's things you just cannot see 

3060
02:27:20,431 --> 02:27:24,110
that.
Then you get a good spotting scope on 

3061
02:27:24,110 --> 02:27:24,110
them.
So with the naked eye,

3062
02:27:24,110 --> 02:27:24,520
like there's things you can't see with 
the naked eye,

3063
02:27:24,521 --> 02:27:27,190
you would swear they do not exist.
They're not there,

3064
02:27:27,580 --> 02:27:31,030
but then you get a great spotting scope 
on them and you could see him miles away

3065
02:27:31,540 --> 02:27:34,240
and that's the thing with ships.
You've got a large ship.

3066
02:27:34,510 --> 02:27:39,510
It goes far enough away.
You can't see it anymore and you'll be 

3067
02:27:39,510 --> 02:27:43,051
convinced that it's disappeared over the
horizon when in fact it's only probably 

3068
02:27:43,051 --> 02:27:47,050
a couple of inches lower on the horizon.
As far as like the curve of the earth,

3069
02:27:47,051 --> 02:27:50,620
but to the naked eye,
it's invisible because so when they zoom

3070
02:27:50,621 --> 02:27:52,840
in on it,
they're convinced that Aha,

3071
02:27:53,020 --> 02:27:54,490
there is no curvature of the earth.
See,

3072
02:27:54,491 --> 02:27:56,290
this looked like it went over the 
horizon,

3073
02:27:56,530 --> 02:27:58,390
but it's an optical illusion.
Yeah,

3074
02:27:58,440 --> 02:28:00,880
and the thing is that I've been sharing 
this so many times because this actually

3075
02:28:00,881 --> 02:28:05,881
happened.
It was this so many videos now on 

3076
02:28:05,881 --> 02:28:07,951
youtube that actually demonstrate this 
thing like this time lapses of ships 

3077
02:28:07,951 --> 02:28:11,761
going over the horizon,
like zoomed in all the way with that p 

3078
02:28:11,761 --> 02:28:15,360
900 cameras.
We do like an 83 times zoom as big as 

3079
02:28:15,360 --> 02:28:15,360
you can go.
Yep.

3080
02:28:15,360 --> 02:28:17,940
It's been demonstrated.
They just ignore her.

3081
02:28:17,980 --> 02:28:21,950
They say they ignore it because it's not
in their same q.

3082
02:28:22,590 --> 02:28:25,220
If you look at the play in the flat 
earth video,

3083
02:28:25,221 --> 02:28:27,790
all the cue to the right is like flat 
earth expose.

3084
02:28:29,330 --> 02:28:31,100
Some of those get hundreds of thousands 
of views.

3085
02:28:31,101 --> 02:28:32,510
This is one guy,
Dr Zack,

3086
02:28:32,520 --> 02:28:37,520
who's a foreign guy who does the.
He does these,

3087
02:28:38,660 --> 02:28:43,660
the these flutters videos and they're 
all mathematically sharing things in 

3088
02:28:43,660 --> 02:28:45,920
autocad with drawn lines and stuff and 
he gets like 400,000

3089
02:28:45,921 --> 02:28:47,170
views.
It's amazing.

3090
02:28:47,180 --> 02:28:48,290
It's bizarre.
Well,

3091
02:28:48,291 --> 02:28:52,550
it's just amazing that so many people 
get get into this and they buy into it.

3092
02:28:52,551 --> 02:28:56,000
Do you see that one where that young man
took a spirit ruler,

3093
02:28:56,630 --> 02:29:01,630
spirit level on an airplane is flying 
around in airplanes and was convinced 

3094
02:29:01,630 --> 02:29:04,160
Darrell Martin is the guy's name.
He lives in a van.

3095
02:29:04,540 --> 02:29:05,390
It doesn't.
Yeah.

3096
02:29:05,391 --> 02:29:08,720
He has a bunch of videos on van life.
He's a cool guy.

3097
02:29:08,840 --> 02:29:13,840
He's a very nice guy,
but he's got this weird idea about 

3098
02:29:13,840 --> 02:29:13,840
aflutter.

3099
02:29:13,840 --> 02:29:17,100
It's so.
I've had a few youtube battles with him 

3100
02:29:17,100 --> 02:29:21,560
where he puts up something about how the
moon is cooling things and he has this 

3101
02:29:24,080 --> 02:29:28,460
thermometer thing showing that the moon 
is actually making things cold.

3102
02:29:28,730 --> 02:29:31,330
Then I put up a videos explaining why,
you know,

3103
02:29:31,331 --> 02:29:33,770
it's just a reflection because he's an 
infrared.

3104
02:29:33,780 --> 02:29:38,780
Thermometers don't work that way and 
then he puts another thing like debunk 

3105
02:29:38,780 --> 02:29:40,250
this mic west.
Like I gave up at that point.

3106
02:29:40,700 --> 02:29:42,740
Wasn't a separate short battle.
Well,

3107
02:29:43,010 --> 02:29:46,730
the weird thing is that they see all 
these other planets is round,

3108
02:29:47,150 --> 02:29:51,050
but they decided that the earth is flat,
that it's some sort of a flat disk.

3109
02:29:51,080 --> 02:29:52,340
Yeah.
The thing is that different.

3110
02:29:52,760 --> 02:29:57,760
Yes.
They are these tiny little bowls that 

3111
02:29:57,760 --> 02:30:00,911
are like two miles wide or something and
they think the earth is really close to 

3112
02:30:00,911 --> 02:30:01,040
the sun.
Yeah,

3113
02:30:01,050 --> 02:30:02,590
I think it's about 4,000
miles away.

3114
02:30:04,100 --> 02:30:05,480
Four miles away.

3115
02:30:08,410 --> 02:30:10,040
Oh,
you fucking idiots.

3116
02:30:10,740 --> 02:30:14,480
They think the distance to the sun.
Various depending on the Observer.

3117
02:30:15,740 --> 02:30:17,020
Observer.
Dependent.

3118
02:30:17,070 --> 02:30:18,200
Oh,
like where you are.

3119
02:30:18,700 --> 02:30:20,580
It's only four miles away.
Imagine if,

3120
02:30:20,850 --> 02:30:23,180
if you drive away,
just get super small,

3121
02:30:23,181 --> 02:30:25,110
like what the fuck?
Yeah.

3122
02:30:25,240 --> 02:30:27,650
I mean it makes no sense.
It's so ridiculous,

3123
02:30:27,860 --> 02:30:32,860
but it's just,
to me it's such a strange thing to 

3124
02:30:32,860 --> 02:30:35,231
concentrate on that this is like their 
identity is wholly invested in improving

3125
02:30:37,341 --> 02:30:40,250
this thing to be some sort of a massive 
conspiracy.

3126
02:30:40,650 --> 02:30:41,330
Yeah,
very,

3127
02:30:41,331 --> 02:30:42,710
very,
very strange.

3128
02:30:42,850 --> 02:30:44,090
It's love it.
You love it.

3129
02:30:44,210 --> 02:30:45,170
They love it.
You love it.

3130
02:30:45,550 --> 02:30:46,760
You love debunking.
That's the thing.

3131
02:30:46,761 --> 02:30:51,761
It's like it's,
it's a rabbit hole for debunkers is a 

3132
02:30:51,761 --> 02:30:55,360
flyer that you just get sucked into it.
It's one of the best ones because it's 

3133
02:30:55,360 --> 02:30:55,360
so silly.
It is.

3134
02:30:55,360 --> 02:30:57,980
There's no.
Here's the thing that people send me.

3135
02:30:58,040 --> 02:31:03,040
People like,
I don't know if they're trolling me or 

3136
02:31:03,040 --> 02:31:05,411
if they're serious,
they'll send me a picture of a glacier 

3137
02:31:05,411 --> 02:31:06,530
and they'll go,
there's your fucking your ice wall.

3138
02:31:06,890 --> 02:31:11,890
Yeah.
They show you the real shelf or 

3139
02:31:11,890 --> 02:31:11,890
something like that.
Like an actual ice shelf on Toptica.

3140
02:31:12,300 --> 02:31:13,400
Yeah.
You can look up the video,

3141
02:31:13,430 --> 02:31:16,310
the picture and see what it actually is.
The government,

3142
02:31:16,340 --> 02:31:19,770
the government is guarding the,
the ice wall

3143
02:31:20,040 --> 02:31:21,600
all around.
So you can't get near it.

3144
02:31:21,601 --> 02:31:22,980
Take pictures of it.
Yeah.

3145
02:31:23,020 --> 02:31:28,020
That's the thing.
Like the southern hemisphere is a huge 

3146
02:31:28,020 --> 02:31:28,020
problem for the,
uh,

3147
02:31:28,020 --> 02:31:28,730
for the flood of authors because you 
can,

3148
02:31:28,770 --> 02:31:32,430
you can have somebody standing on light 
the south of South America.

3149
02:31:32,431 --> 02:31:34,470
So I went to in Australia and they both 
looking south,

3150
02:31:34,471 --> 02:31:37,740
which on a desk will be away looking 
completely different directions.

3151
02:31:37,741 --> 02:31:39,270
And they're both actually.
Yeah,

3152
02:31:39,271 --> 02:31:41,220
because they're both fairly close to 
each other really.

3153
02:31:41,310 --> 02:31:43,020
They're looking at the same stars in the
sky.

3154
02:31:43,160 --> 02:31:44,810
Yeah,
and there's this,

3155
02:31:44,880 --> 02:31:47,750
even though they're really complicated 
explanations for the flush of.

3156
02:31:47,820 --> 02:31:50,160
Don't explain that.
One of the.

3157
02:31:50,700 --> 02:31:55,700
The hot irrefutable proofs of a round a 
constantly changing their story based on

3158
02:31:59,011 --> 02:32:04,011
what gets debunked.
Like the big one that do bay was saying 

3159
02:32:04,011 --> 02:32:07,941
forever,
every photograph of earth from space is 

3160
02:32:07,941 --> 02:32:07,941
a composite.
Well that's not true.

3161
02:32:08,460 --> 02:32:11,490
They have full scale.
Full image,

3162
02:32:11,790 --> 02:32:15,150
high resolution photographs from the 
[inaudible] eight.

3163
02:32:15,270 --> 02:32:15,900
Yeah.
Those are fake.

3164
02:32:15,930 --> 02:32:19,410
Then they decided that those are fake.
So at first it was those,

3165
02:32:19,440 --> 02:32:24,440
they're composites,
which there was some composites from 

3166
02:32:24,440 --> 02:32:26,320
lower side lights and then blue marble 
thing.

3167
02:32:26,460 --> 02:32:27,380
That's how that goes.
Stuff.

3168
02:32:27,400 --> 02:32:30,790
It is the famous issue of famous image 
of the Blue Mobile,

3169
02:32:31,860 --> 02:32:36,290
which is a NASA very high resolution 
image that they did back in the nineties

3170
02:32:36,800 --> 02:32:41,800
from composites because they went to to 
get something which had all of the 

3171
02:32:41,800 --> 02:32:42,400
landmass without any clouds on.
Right.

3172
02:32:42,720 --> 02:32:47,720
So they have to take loads and loads of 
pitches and just take the bits that had 

3173
02:32:47,720 --> 02:32:50,181
no clouds on and then stitch them all 
together and then they created this 

3174
02:32:50,181 --> 02:32:53,211
thing and then they did a separate one 
that had just the clouds and then they 

3175
02:32:53,211 --> 02:32:53,211
can put them together and move them 
around and stuff.

3176
02:32:53,211 --> 02:32:56,400
How many different satellites are taking
full earth images?

3177
02:32:57,480 --> 02:33:02,340
Probably around 30 or 40.
How many of those are run by government?

3178
02:33:02,341 --> 02:33:03,660
Chills.
A.

3179
02:33:03,661 --> 02:33:08,661
They're all run by government.
Actually not all run by well are eight 

3180
02:33:08,661 --> 02:33:12,240
is the Japanese one was a Russian one,
which is about the same.

3181
02:33:12,340 --> 02:33:15,360
Especially to Russian wounds.
There's a European one,

3182
02:33:15,860 --> 02:33:20,860
meteo sat and the American high 
resolution one just went up a few months

3183
02:33:22,620 --> 02:33:27,620
ago.
It's offline at the moment because the 

3184
02:33:27,620 --> 02:33:28,350
moving it from one side of the United 
States to the other.

3185
02:33:29,010 --> 02:33:30,000
Damn.
They moving it.

3186
02:33:30,090 --> 02:33:32,280
How long does that take?
A few days.

3187
02:33:32,400 --> 02:33:34,820
Jesus now?
Yeah.

3188
02:33:34,980 --> 02:33:38,220
How the fuck do they do that?
Little little jets.

3189
02:33:38,760 --> 02:33:39,630
Oh yeah,
yeah.

3190
02:33:39,631 --> 02:33:42,030
You've seen a gravity.
Yeah.

3191
02:33:42,210 --> 02:33:47,210
That's how things move around and get 
things moving in a direction and then 

3192
02:33:47,210 --> 02:33:49,800
sending them the anchor it in that spot.
That's something that confuses people is

3193
02:33:49,801 --> 02:33:51,720
how to rockets work in space.

3194
02:33:52,590 --> 02:33:54,930
They think that because there's no 
atmosphere in space,

3195
02:33:54,931 --> 02:33:57,220
there's nothing to push against.
Right?

3196
02:33:57,300 --> 02:33:59,730
So how does a rocket actually work in 
space?

3197
02:33:59,810 --> 02:34:02,880
Or does it?
It's action and reaction.

3198
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:05,790
If you throw something in this 
direction,

3199
02:34:05,970 --> 02:34:09,570
you will move in the opposite direction.
I say if you sit in your chair,

3200
02:34:09,690 --> 02:34:13,080
take a big bowling ball or something,
throw it in that direction really fast,

3201
02:34:13,260 --> 02:34:16,370
you'll move back a bit.
So if you get like a,

3202
02:34:16,640 --> 02:34:21,640
an air,
a hose and you pointed us in that 

3203
02:34:21,640 --> 02:34:21,640
direction and you're standing on ice or 
something,

3204
02:34:21,640 --> 02:34:23,460
you will move in the opposite direction.
It doesn't matter if there's a.

3205
02:34:23,860 --> 02:34:28,860
If you throw something that way,
that has to be her reaction in the 

3206
02:34:28,860 --> 02:34:28,860
opposite direction.
Okay,

3207
02:34:28,860 --> 02:34:30,370
that makes sense.
Um,

3208
02:34:30,610 --> 02:34:32,680
a lot of those guys don't even believe 
in satellites.

3209
02:34:32,980 --> 02:34:33,990
Yeah.
They don't have to.

3210
02:34:34,010 --> 02:34:39,010
Because how could they?
They think that they think that signals 

3211
02:34:39,010 --> 02:34:39,280
are bounced off the ionosphere.

3212
02:34:39,780 --> 02:34:41,530
There's no satellite.
Yeah.

3213
02:34:41,590 --> 02:34:43,330
But you can,
you can see this adult lives.

3214
02:34:43,690 --> 02:34:44,560
Yeah,
you can see,

3215
02:34:44,720 --> 02:34:49,720
you can see the space station,
you can see it fly overhead and I get 

3216
02:34:49,720 --> 02:34:51,760
emails whenever it is gonna fly overhead
and I go out and have a look and you can

3217
02:34:51,761 --> 02:34:56,761
see I've taken pictures of it.
You can see the solar panels and the 

3218
02:34:56,761 --> 02:34:56,761
photographs that I've taken.
Wow.

3219
02:34:56,761 --> 02:35:01,230
And it always appears exactly where 
necessarily it's going to appear 

3220
02:35:01,230 --> 02:35:04,920
anywhere in the world.
That's the other problem with these 

3221
02:35:04,920 --> 02:35:05,890
people that don't believe in satellites.
Is that,

3222
02:35:05,950 --> 02:35:10,950
how are we tracking the weather then?
How do we know exactly when the 

3223
02:35:10,950 --> 02:35:11,200
hurricane's coming in weather balloons?

3224
02:35:13,930 --> 02:35:15,580
Yeah.
It's uh,

3225
02:35:16,870 --> 02:35:20,830
it's my concern about all this in 
particular,

3226
02:35:20,831 --> 02:35:25,831
like the flatter stuff is young kids 
wasting their time on stupid shit when 

3227
02:35:26,411 --> 02:35:31,411
the world is filled with massive real 
mysteries and incredibly fascinating 

3228
02:35:32,621 --> 02:35:35,890
things you should be diving in and 
learning about.

3229
02:35:36,040 --> 02:35:41,040
I think there's a great opportunity for 
teaching kids with things like flatter 

3230
02:35:41,040 --> 02:35:45,400
you can do real experiments to determine
that the earth is not flat.

3231
02:35:46,930 --> 02:35:50,080
Maybe even more importantly,
teaching them about traps.

3232
02:35:50,290 --> 02:35:51,670
Thinking trap.
Yes.

3233
02:35:51,860 --> 02:35:55,530
The mind can allow you to go down.
You can teach them how to debunk.

3234
02:35:55,880 --> 02:35:59,920
Say this guy is saying that ships should
reappear when we zoom in,

3235
02:35:59,950 --> 02:36:03,100
how do we test this and then they can 
get out and tested it.

3236
02:36:03,250 --> 02:36:05,600
Yeah,
well that that was.

3237
02:36:05,770 --> 02:36:10,770
That one was so stunningly stupid to me 
and then I don't even want to go into 

3238
02:36:10,920 --> 02:36:14,560
the flat earth thing anymore,
but it's the thinking behind it.

3239
02:36:14,590 --> 02:36:19,590
That's the problem.
The thinking that every single airline 

3240
02:36:19,590 --> 02:36:24,330
pilot,
everyone involved in commercial 

3241
02:36:24,330 --> 02:36:26,830
shipping,
everyone involved in aerospace.

3242
02:36:26,831 --> 02:36:28,940
Everyone who makes satellites,
everyone,

3243
02:36:29,110 --> 02:36:31,660
all those people are lying.
Every cartographer,

3244
02:36:31,870 --> 02:36:33,730
everyone,
all the mapmakers,

3245
02:36:33,790 --> 02:36:35,020
everyone.
They're all full of shit.

3246
02:36:35,110 --> 02:36:39,220
Everyone is agreed to not tell everyone 
else about the ice wall.

3247
02:36:39,670 --> 02:36:41,650
If the earth was flat and there was an 
ice wall,

3248
02:36:41,680 --> 02:36:46,680
scientists with detail it and they would
explain why the earth was flat and they 

3249
02:36:46,680 --> 02:36:50,461
would show you a working model of the 
earth being flat and that's what they 

3250
02:36:50,461 --> 02:36:51,040
would teach in school.
There would be no.

3251
02:36:51,430 --> 02:36:56,430
There's no benefit whatsoever to 
describing the earth in a shape that it 

3252
02:36:56,430 --> 02:37:01,140
doesn't exist in.
Andy will be obvious that the earth was 

3253
02:37:01,140 --> 02:37:02,530
flat because you can be able to do like 
really simple tests yourself.

3254
02:37:02,590 --> 02:37:05,400
You see boats not going over the 
horizon.

3255
02:37:05,810 --> 02:37:10,810
It's just so disturbing.
He would say the sun gets smaller as it 

3256
02:37:10,810 --> 02:37:13,951
gets further away.
The Sun stays exactly the same size 

3257
02:37:13,951 --> 02:37:14,950
throughout the day.
Sunrise,

3258
02:37:15,140 --> 02:37:16,130
noon,
sunset

3259
02:37:16,460 --> 02:37:18,440
at the same size of the moon does the 
same thing.

3260
02:37:18,500 --> 02:37:19,940
Why does the moon look so much bigger 
though?

3261
02:37:19,941 --> 02:37:22,580
When it's on the horizon with obstacle 
of the optical illusion?

3262
02:37:22,760 --> 02:37:27,230
What is it is a perspective issue like 
just the way your brain works.

3263
02:37:27,260 --> 02:37:32,260
If you take photographs of it like on 
the horizon and then another photograph 

3264
02:37:32,260 --> 02:37:33,370
of it when it's right up there and 
compare them side by side,

3265
02:37:33,371 --> 02:37:35,990
they be the same.
Same zoom settings is exactly the same,

3266
02:37:36,050 --> 02:37:39,050
but it's interesting because it really 
does look larger when it gets lower.

3267
02:37:39,110 --> 02:37:42,890
It's purely psychological.
The harvest moon,

3268
02:37:42,891 --> 02:37:45,440
right?
Yeah.

3269
02:37:45,680 --> 02:37:47,270
Uh,
what is the August man?

3270
02:37:47,340 --> 02:37:52,340
Not that big old red moon or something 
as the blood moon eclipse at the beaver 

3271
02:37:53,421 --> 02:37:58,421
moon to beaver moon that you would take 
one didn't know about a beaver moon 

3272
02:37:59,290 --> 02:38:04,290
until they said it was the super moon,
which is when the moon is just very 

3273
02:38:04,401 --> 02:38:04,880
close to you.

3274
02:38:05,270 --> 02:38:07,670
What is the Super Moon?
How much closer is a superman?

3275
02:38:08,200 --> 02:38:10,220
It's not much closer.
Really.

3276
02:38:10,310 --> 02:38:13,930
The eight actually only gets about eight
percent bigger than it.

3277
02:38:13,931 --> 02:38:16,250
Smallest is actually a very hard to see 
that.

3278
02:38:16,251 --> 02:38:18,050
It's actually any big ap put them side 
by side.

3279
02:38:19,370 --> 02:38:21,980
That's a lot though.
But people and yeah,

3280
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:27,000
you see these news stories about 
superbowl and go look at the super moon 

3281
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:27,000
tonight when it's,
uh,

3282
02:38:27,320 --> 02:38:28,940
it's not that much difference.
Oh.

3283
02:38:29,330 --> 02:38:30,950
Oh Wow.
That looks a little bit different.

3284
02:38:31,010 --> 02:38:36,010
But that's the very smallest movement 
and the very largest moon most of the 

3285
02:38:36,010 --> 02:38:36,010
time it's going to be somewhere in 
between that.

3286
02:38:36,010 --> 02:38:37,550
So you're not really going to notice the
difference.

3287
02:38:38,860 --> 02:38:39,310
All right.
Then,

3288
02:38:39,311 --> 02:38:41,960
anything else we should cover before we 
wrap this up?

3289
02:38:44,630 --> 02:38:49,630
Let me look at my list.
I have to write lists because my memory 

3290
02:38:49,630 --> 02:38:49,630
is so bad.
Now.

3291
02:38:49,810 --> 02:38:51,890
I've offloaded everything like,
you know,

3292
02:38:51,891 --> 02:38:56,891
you're a standup comedians that you 
could have mail to memorize all this 

3293
02:38:56,891 --> 02:38:56,891
stuff.

3294
02:38:56,891 --> 02:38:56,891
Well,
not only that,

3295
02:38:56,891 --> 02:39:00,581
I have to memorize fights to UFC 
information in my head and I have comedy

3296
02:39:00,951 --> 02:39:05,951
information in my head,
but if you asked me to do my act that I 

3297
02:39:05,951 --> 02:39:09,380
did from last year like that,
I filmed for my netflix special.

3298
02:39:09,440 --> 02:39:09,960
I wouldn't be able to

3299
02:39:10,030 --> 02:39:11,490
do it.
Yeah.

3300
02:39:11,540 --> 02:39:16,540
Looking at my list and we've kind of 
covered most of the things that are on 

3301
02:39:16,540 --> 02:39:16,750
here.
We could go over some like nine slash 11

3302
02:39:16,751 --> 02:39:19,430
crap if you wanted to,
but I'm tired of it.

3303
02:39:20,110 --> 02:39:22,450
That's the thing about it.
At this stage of my life,

3304
02:39:22,480 --> 02:39:25,870
it's,
it seems when there's so many incredible

3305
02:39:25,871 --> 02:39:29,320
things to pay attention to that a real,
you know,

3306
02:39:29,650 --> 02:39:34,650
this is what I feel like about all this 
stuff where people are looking into 

3307
02:39:34,650 --> 02:39:35,260
conspiracies,
that they're just nonsense.

3308
02:39:35,261 --> 02:39:37,210
It's like you're chasing,
they're chasing their tail.

3309
02:39:37,570 --> 02:39:41,560
They're trying to confirm something 
where there's so much evidence that it's

3310
02:39:41,561 --> 02:39:42,970
not real,
that it just,

3311
02:39:43,230 --> 02:39:48,230
it really bothers me.
It drives me nuts and I just don't 

3312
02:39:48,230 --> 02:39:48,700
understand it and I don't,
I just,

3313
02:39:48,880 --> 02:39:51,880
I wish that it wasn't a problem.
I wish it wasn't an issue,

3314
02:39:52,260 --> 02:39:57,260
you know,
and it is and it's one of the reasons 

3315
02:39:57,260 --> 02:39:59,701
why I continue to talk about these 
things and I really want to shine as 

3316
02:39:59,701 --> 02:40:01,140
much light on them as possible so that 
there's,

3317
02:40:02,080 --> 02:40:07,080
there's a real pattern that you could 
fall into and you can waste a tremendous

3318
02:40:07,151 --> 02:40:12,151
amount of time in your life if you start
looking at things incorrectly and flat 

3319
02:40:12,891 --> 02:40:14,040
earth me is the best

3320
02:40:14,040 --> 02:40:19,040
example of it.
It's the best example because it's so 

3321
02:40:19,040 --> 02:40:20,250
stupid.
I mean it's so utterly preposterous that

3322
02:40:20,251 --> 02:40:24,510
everyone is lying and that there are no 
images at all of this flatter,

3323
02:40:24,570 --> 02:40:29,570
but yet this one guy or a couple of guys
and I had heard that it started out as 

3324
02:40:29,701 --> 02:40:32,400
a,
as a troll on four Chan,

3325
02:40:32,790 --> 02:40:35,640
is that they had started doing this like
way back in,

3326
02:40:35,641 --> 02:40:40,641
you know,
like it could have been flooded I think 

3327
02:40:40,641 --> 02:40:42,941
goes back to the 18th,
but the people would like reignited it 

3328
02:40:42,941 --> 02:40:44,730
either way.
Just using that as a shit posting was we

3329
02:40:44,731 --> 02:40:49,731
talked about last time shit posting that
people have always believed in the 

3330
02:40:49,731 --> 02:40:49,731
flood.
Uh,

3331
02:40:49,731 --> 02:40:51,880
yeah.
Let's wrap it up West.

3332
02:40:52,020 --> 02:40:57,020
I'm so [inaudible] dot com.
If anybody wants to go to [inaudible] 

3333
02:40:57,020 --> 02:41:01,040
dot org,
my upcoming book escaping the rabbit 

3334
02:41:01,040 --> 02:41:01,500
hole.
What is that coming out next September.

3335
02:41:01,560 --> 02:41:03,520
But have you finished it?
Have you done?

3336
02:41:03,570 --> 02:41:04,290
Nearly done?
Yeah,

3337
02:41:04,291 --> 02:41:05,220
nearly done.
Okay.

3338
02:41:05,280 --> 02:41:06,270
Excellent.
Alright.

3339
02:41:06,330 --> 02:41:07,200
Midwest,
everybody.

3340
02:41:07,740 --> 02:41:10,080
We'll be back tomorrow with UFC 
heavyweight champion.

3341
02:41:10,081 --> 02:41:11,190
Steep Emile chick.

3342
02:41:12,650 --> 02:41:14,120
See.
