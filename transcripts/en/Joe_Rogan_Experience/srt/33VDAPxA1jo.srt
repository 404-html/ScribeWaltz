1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:02,460
So glad you're here,
man.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,030
Thank you Rebecca.
Please fucking pumped.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,570
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is 
brought to you by the fleshlight.

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,780
If you go to Joe Rogan.net
and click on the link for the flashlight

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:17,130
and enter in the code named Rogan,
you will save yourself 15 percent.

6
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:19,380
How's that time?
I read a good deal.

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,270
I have a flashlight on me right now.
Do you?

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,030
Did he have one yesterday?
Have a flow state that leads me to where

9
00:00:24,031 --> 00:00:27,480
I keep my flashlight to a little case in
my house.

10
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,190
I'll give you one little bit.
Leave.

11
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:32,880
I don't need it,
but I've got plenty of.

12
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:34,790
Hey,
I'm making a good living.

13
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:37,930
Expensive.
Thank you.

14
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,690
And I'm not shy.
You're not a shy guy.

15
00:00:39,691 --> 00:00:41,300
If you wanted one you would just buy it.
No,

16
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,290
no.
Joe was using that earlier.

17
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,470
No one used that.
We wouldn't do that to.

18
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,690
He's done that to other people.
I would not allow him to do that.

19
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,020
Sure.
Come on dog.

20
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,800
You know,
I love you mom.

21
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,090
I love you.
Like I love air.

22
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:54,600
The,
uh,

23
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,130
we're also brought to you by onnit.com.
Makers of Alpha brain,

24
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,160
the nootropic supplement,
if you're interested in any of this 

25
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,771
stuff,
I suggest to you a checking out our 

26
00:01:06,771 --> 00:01:07,110
website,
a on it o n n I t.com,

27
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,160
and be just google nootropics and read 
all the pros and cons on.

28
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,140
Don't just go out there and buy 
something,

29
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:16,600
but if you're interested in our stuff,
it's a full spectrum neutral.

30
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:21,730
It's all balanced out and explained 
online and as much technical and 

31
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:26,451
scientific details we can.
We're actually funding studies on this 

32
00:01:26,451 --> 00:01:29,220
right now and we're hoping that it was 
going to be done at Boston University's,

33
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,540
uh,
if it's not,

34
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:32,880
the other option I think was university 
of Australia,

35
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,460
one of the universities in Australia 
that doesn't work.

36
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,270
Columbus state to find some closure 
option.

37
00:01:39,271 --> 00:01:44,271
We're going to Australia find some 
Komodo island dudes that are selling 

38
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:44,970
certificates.
Um,

39
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:45,760
it's,
uh,

40
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,790
we have 100 percent money back 
guarantee.

41
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:51,620
This is the most important thing,
but when you go through the do anything,

42
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,880
the money back,
it's not worth it.

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,110
Some people,
it is.

44
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,360
First of all,
what does the supplement do for you?

45
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,570
The supplement is a cognitive enhancing 
supplement.

46
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:01,250
Don,
my rarer,

47
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,540
it makes your mind function a little bit
better,

48
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:06,840
a little neuro cup of coffee if you what
we're just talking about.

49
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:12,020
I forgot the to Rita.
That's not what we're talking about.

50
00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:17,481
We're talking about vitamins.
You dirty bitch vitamins and discounts 

51
00:02:17,481 --> 00:02:20,541
and the fact that you could send it back
and you get 100 percent of your money 

52
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:20,541
back.
Can you take 100 percent?

53
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:20,900
Can you drink with them?
Oh yeah,

54
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:22,500
it's a vitamin.

55
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,780
I just always ask a doctor whenever it 
gives me something.

56
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,210
There are certain nutrients that they've
discovered,

57
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:32,230
you know,
that help Alzheimer's patients are 

58
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:32,790
nutrients that help people after they've
had some head trauma.

59
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:35,010
That was what a Roman ascii stuff was 
based on.

60
00:02:35,011 --> 00:02:37,190
I know you're a big football fan,
Bill Roman ask.

61
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,930
He has his own very similar line of this
kind of stuff.

62
00:02:39,931 --> 00:02:44,931
He's got something called neuro one,
which I also like and maybe some people 

63
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:46,900
might like even better than Alpha brain 
because it's a drink and you'll like it.

64
00:02:46,901 --> 00:02:49,770
You could just mix it up like some 
people don't like swallowing pills.

65
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:54,830
I don't give a fuck.
I take two Alpha brains and I'm 

66
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:54,830
straight.
I like it.

67
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:55,340
You like it up?
Yeah,

68
00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:00,390
just for lips.
Just for giggles and were just first 

69
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,200
story,
like Shit's bad than the good surprises.

70
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,130
I never did this positive,
but you know what?

71
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:08,130
I met Romanowski in Denver with the 
Broncos retraining and Haley Colorado 

72
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,040
and they told me I wanted to interview 
him.

73
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,580
I said the show called off.
So it was essentially.

74
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,390
Yeah,
I remember that.

75
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,700
And they said you don't want an 
interview with bill.

76
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,580
And I said,
no,

77
00:03:16,581 --> 00:03:18,550
I do.
So we got to lunch.

78
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,890
The whole place is filled.
There's a table for eight.

79
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:26,310
It's empty with just him sitting there.
It's not crazy because nobody wanted to 

80
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:26,310
eat lunch with them.
Wow.

81
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,800
I've talked to him subsequently saying,
sounds cool man.

82
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,650
The dude had a ton of concussions.
Yeah,

83
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:37,740
a ton of concussions.
And that was the reason why he created 

84
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,561
this neuro Juana.
I watched a whole interview with him 

85
00:03:40,561 --> 00:03:40,561
about it.
Fascinating stuff.

86
00:03:40,561 --> 00:03:44,670
You know,
the guy realized that he was having 

87
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:44,670
problems and he tried to counteract that
with nutrients.

88
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:49,830
And so that's uh,
I was taught this by a first exposed to 

89
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:53,660
his stuff by no name from a member of 
Sara and no name on it.

90
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,090
Yeah,
he did.

91
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,850
I did two for Wella.
It's just a joke.

92
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,530
He did.
Yeah,

93
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:02,830
he did.
San Fran did it for a job.

94
00:04:02,831 --> 00:04:04,330
Who's pis?
I drank my own.

95
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:06,060
I wasn't going to drink anybody else.
I'll let may.

96
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,290
Maybe a dominatrix now.
How dare you.

97
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,710
Dumb you dirty boy last night.
Anyway,

98
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,030
check out just a free plug for Mr.
Roman [inaudible].

99
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,650
I enjoyed his stuff.
Check out neuro one.

100
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:20,860
If you want to check out our stuff,
go to [inaudible] dot com.

101
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:23,680
We have one in it,
not just Alpha brain,

102
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:26,470
which is something that I use everyday.
And again,

103
00:04:26,471 --> 00:04:28,720
as I said,
it's 100 percent money back guarantee on

104
00:04:28,721 --> 00:04:31,450
the first order.
You don't have to 30 pills,

105
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:34,000
can't like get a big giant bottle.
And then the Newbie,

106
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,630
but 30 pills,
the first 30 pill bottle,

107
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:42,650
it's,
we want to make sure that no one feels 

108
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:42,650
ripped off.
Does I use this stuff?

109
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:43,320
I've used this stuff way before I was,
uh,

110
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,010
you know,
uh,

111
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:47,220
associated with on it.
I believe nootropics are a,

112
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:50,200
an effective way to give yourself a 
little mental edge.

113
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,850
And I also believe in regular vitamins.
I tell people I drink a kale shakes.

114
00:04:54,851 --> 00:04:57,100
I tried to do it every single day.
It's big,

115
00:04:57,101 --> 00:05:00,580
crazy mixture of Greens.
I take all sorts of vitamins.

116
00:05:00,581 --> 00:05:05,581
I say take all sorts of antioxidants.
I try to drink as much Kombucha as I 

117
00:05:05,581 --> 00:05:07,220
can.
I take as Adopolis.

118
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,240
I take a lot of like healthy live 
cultures and I absolutely know for a 

119
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,860
fact by my own personal experience that 
that's enhanced my life.

120
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,670
Was the guy that just had an astronomy 
sandwich can put that shit away.

121
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,380
I put that shit away.
You know why?

122
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,600
Because I'm going to do kettle bells two
hours.

123
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:27,660
What's a head toothpaste that's.
I have these giant iron cannonballs that

124
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:28,300
swing around.

125
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,710
I got to show it to you.
You'll love it.

126
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:34,300
So craziest exercise ever is this 
Russian strength training where you,

127
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:39,301
you're,
you're swinging around these fucking 

128
00:05:39,301 --> 00:05:40,330
giant cannon balls.
So every movement is a compound movement

129
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:43,030
that requires your whole body to work as
one unit.

130
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,880
So it transfers very well athletically.
Look,

131
00:05:45,881 --> 00:05:48,570
did you Jitsu or to football or even 
about,

132
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,290
you know,
you're a good basketball player.

133
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,510
It would transfer even at that.
If it's kettlebells,

134
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:56,610
like one of the best exercises I've ever
used ever.

135
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,600
So fucking it's the.
It's a great way to work out.

136
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:01,940
It's brutal and you can get done in 20 
minutes.

137
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:07,630
You can just blow it out in 20 minutes 
and then you're fucking wrecked for two 

138
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:07,630
days.
It's amazing.

139
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,830
It's so good.
It's such a good exercise.

140
00:06:09,831 --> 00:06:12,800
I was hoping maybe we just shoot a 
little pool buddy.

141
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:14,720
We're going to do that for sure.

142
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,630
Anyway,
back to the commercial on a.com.

143
00:06:17,631 --> 00:06:22,340
Go check out Alpha brain checkout.
There's a shroom tech sport which is a a

144
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:27,341
quarter steps mushroom,
be 12 and a bunch of other stuff in 

145
00:06:27,341 --> 00:06:30,250
their supplement for endurance,
which cordyceps mushroom is.

146
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:35,430
It's actually a nutrient that people 
started eating at high altitudes and 

147
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:38,801
help them deal with the lack of oxygen 
and they believed that it helps in 

148
00:06:38,801 --> 00:06:41,030
difference and especially when combined 
with be 12 people love it.

149
00:06:41,031 --> 00:06:44,030
A lot of Jujitsu guys love the shroom 
tech sport.

150
00:06:44,031 --> 00:06:49,031
I get that all the time and shroom tech 
immune is another one that's also a 

151
00:06:49,031 --> 00:06:51,200
mushroom based supplement that actually 
enhances your immune system.

152
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,630
So fascinating concept.
The way it works,

153
00:06:53,631 --> 00:06:56,120
being that it tricks your body into 
thinking.

154
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:01,150
It's like cold,
so your body fires up a domain system 

155
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,911
for a fight that never takes place.
Coca leaves before I go into the 

156
00:07:03,911 --> 00:07:03,911
Hollywood hills.

157
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,420
It's a good move because of the 
altitude.

158
00:07:05,421 --> 00:07:06,830
You get those,
you know go.

159
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,420
Yeah,
I know some.

160
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,360
Some Bolivians can't grow.
That shit here is.

161
00:07:11,361 --> 00:07:16,361
Can you grow it here?
If you have a greenhouse at work and 

162
00:07:16,361 --> 00:07:16,361
grow anything.
Why the fuck?

163
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,450
Why don't they have greenhouse?
They.

164
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,440
I never saw green here.
Why's everybody grown?

165
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,960
Coke in the third world.
When you just get a nice greenhouse.

166
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,600
Yeah.
Is it like undercover?

167
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:30,610
My blowing up their spot right now.
I probably shouldn't be talking about 

168
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:30,610
this on a.com.
Oh,

169
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,360
and it go check out all the shit.
New Moods,

170
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:35,150
a five htp,
tryptophan enhancing.

171
00:07:35,151 --> 00:07:40,151
I'll supplement and entering the code 
named Rogan and you will get 10 percent 

172
00:07:40,151 --> 00:07:42,740
off all your orders and remember always 
the first order of 30 pills.

173
00:07:42,741 --> 00:07:44,240
If you don't like everything,
it's bullshit.

174
00:07:44,241 --> 00:07:45,470
It's not for you.
Whatever.

175
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,320
Whatever you feel you can get 100 
percent of your money back.

176
00:07:48,321 --> 00:07:49,940
You don't even have to return the 
product.

177
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:55,180
We're way more concerned with people not
feeling ripped off than we are with 

178
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:55,180
making money.
All right.

179
00:07:55,180 --> 00:08:00,160
I have a question.
Try to keep it on the level of their 

180
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,510
show with this commercial.
This is over commercials over and then 

181
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:02,780
we go on for like two hours just 
talking.

182
00:08:02,781 --> 00:08:03,980
Shit.
Ready?

183
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:07,220
Why don't we have lunch together?
Talked about everything.

184
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,800
What are you doing,
Brian?

185
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,920
Nothing.
What happened?

186
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:17,020
You slipped.
You.

187
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:19,330
Are you a Dj now?
I am in now.

188
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,630
You've been hanging out with Russell 
Peters.

189
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,070
I have been.
All right.

190
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,900
Give Gimme some doctors.
Scratch Gimme something.

191
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,680
We've got to have Nick Diaz.
Yeah.

192
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,600
I don't think you should do that 
anymore.

193
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:45,080
I don't think that's.
I don't like that.

194
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:51,180
I don't like that.
I want to hear Nick Diaz voice and Nick 

195
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:51,230
Diaz is one of the fighters in the UFC 
guy.

196
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,210
Really the coolest thing ever.
He want to fight.

197
00:08:53,211 --> 00:08:56,660
Then after the fight he goes,
train by day Joe Rogan podcast by night.

198
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,700
Greatest moment of my program experience

199
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,200
Joe Rogan podcast.

200
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,360
This guy likes fucking around with the 
speeds of things.

201
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,860
Let's go get some technological age 
going on.

202
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,020
Welcome to the show and thank you.
So happy to have you here.

203
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:26,250
Dominant a railroad just before,
just to all you folks out there in the 

204
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,741
cyber world is a guy that I actually 
paid to see before I got into comedy.

205
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:35,420
I was a huge fan and uh,
I,

206
00:09:35,421 --> 00:09:37,280
I just,
I love standup comedy.

207
00:09:37,281 --> 00:09:41,780
I loved watching evening at the Improv 
and I took a date to the,

208
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:46,781
uh,
to Nick's comedy stop and Boston to 

209
00:09:46,781 --> 00:09:49,871
watch dahmer.
I think maybe I had done an open mic 

210
00:09:49,871 --> 00:09:50,400
like maybe once,
maybe I might not have even.

211
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:55,420
It might've even been before,
but I remember I watched there and one 

212
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,720
of the things you,
you,

213
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:57,530
uh,
first of all,

214
00:09:57,531 --> 00:09:58,490
you,
you were,

215
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:03,580
you fucking killed and you were one of 
the few guys that could survive that 

216
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,690
crazy Boston gauntlet that they used to 
throw it on the national head,

217
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,660
but they liked me and so everybody loved
you.

218
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:13,840
But it was a,
it was a tricky situation that Boston 

219
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,931
gauntlet taste through.
It would take a guy like billy crystal 

220
00:10:16,931 --> 00:10:17,420
would come into town,
right?

221
00:10:17,421 --> 00:10:22,421
And they would make billy crystal.
They would purposely put up the best 

222
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:23,900
local guys.
Steve Sweeney,

223
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,380
Don Gavin,
Kenny,

224
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,810
Kenny,
everybody would go up with 15 minutes.

225
00:10:29,811 --> 00:10:34,811
I'll fucking fury to short sets and 
you're supposed to do 50 at the end and 

226
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:35,690
then,
you know,

227
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,890
at the end.
But first of all,

228
00:10:36,891 --> 00:10:41,630
they've made everyone laugh with every 
local reference humanly possible.

229
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,940
And if there's anything people love in 
Boston,

230
00:10:43,941 --> 00:10:45,890
it's a Boston joke.
It's a problem.

231
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:51,100
I had like my first 20 minutes all 
revolved around Boston because when 

232
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,311
you're,
when you're fucking sinking out there 

233
00:10:54,311 --> 00:10:56,741
and you're looking for some,
you know that you could make fun of a 

234
00:10:56,741 --> 00:10:56,741
girl from revere.
She has big hair.

235
00:10:56,741 --> 00:10:56,741
That's right there.
It's in my.

236
00:10:56,741 --> 00:10:57,530
It's in my wheelhouse.

237
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,600
I can pull that out.
You know,

238
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,130
you could always go with like local 
Charleston,

239
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,110
the Irish girls and all that.
Yeah,

240
00:11:03,111 --> 00:11:03,620
yeah,
yeah,

241
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,070
yeah.
There was.

242
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,420
There's always something like,
well,

243
00:11:05,421 --> 00:11:09,230
and then you're in Japan after dark 
Spanish.

244
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,780
Yeah.
You could.

245
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:14,060
You could do like local jokes and you 
survived.

246
00:11:14,061 --> 00:11:15,860
You survived.
You're one of the few guys.

247
00:11:15,861 --> 00:11:18,380
I saw a lot of guys eat up fat bag of 
dicks.

248
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,230
I heard Richard Lewis hid under the 
stage afterwards.

249
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:21,800
Oh,
I heard.

250
00:11:21,801 --> 00:11:23,050
He said,
well,

251
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,280
I've heard that a few times with that 
guy.

252
00:11:25,281 --> 00:11:28,760
He's apparently,
if he doesn't get like his crowd,

253
00:11:28,761 --> 00:11:33,761
like he has a very specific crowd that 
like comes up to see them and sometimes 

254
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:38,170
you know,
people maybe don't know what he's going 

255
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:38,170
to do before he does it.
If they do,

256
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:38,570
they love it.
They love that character.

257
00:11:38,571 --> 00:11:41,360
But if they don't,
I think from what I've heard,

258
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,100
it can go bad.
I can imagine.

259
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:48,390
Remember Nick's,
Nick's was the place where you saw me 

260
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:52,240
and that was really a tough club and 
especially the third show in Friday 

261
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,390
night.
So I asked Jonathan Katz due to show 

262
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:55,390
with me,
you know,

263
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:55,390
how Jonathan

264
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:58,900
is very nebbishy and little Jewish 
comedian versus a hosted my first open.

265
00:11:58,901 --> 00:11:59,580
Like,
what was he?

266
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,490
Yeah,
it was nice.

267
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,210
Theoretical,
right?

268
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,370
Yeah.
And he,

269
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,940
uh,
I said John did a show at me.

270
00:12:03,941 --> 00:12:04,690
He goes,
I can't,

271
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:05,560
I can't go in there.
I said,

272
00:12:05,561 --> 00:12:06,550
come on,
I'll protect you.

273
00:12:06,551 --> 00:12:07,480
You know,
watch your back.

274
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:12,750
She goes up.
They actually started heckling the back 

275
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,100
of his bald head before he got to the 
stage for nothing.

276
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:16,480
He didn't say anything.
He goes up,

277
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,170
it goes a precisely,
just walks off the stage.

278
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,600
They booed him before he talked.
I love the.

279
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:31,120
Boston was an interesting mix of college
educated people and savages.

280
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:31,890
Yeah.
It's,

281
00:12:31,891 --> 00:12:33,490
uh,
it is one of the,

282
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:38,491
it has,
I think has the highest amount of 

283
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,381
colleges per capita in the country.
And I couldn't get in any of them in 

284
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,990
our.
I used to see street fights there when,

285
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,130
when you didn't see them anymore,
you see guys,

286
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:48,760
they didn't go home and work at a tie 
white shirt hanging out.

287
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,230
Oh yeah.
Battling each other.

288
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,590
There's still fights in Boston.
Boston dudes will still fight.

289
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,010
It's one of the few places where you're 
probably not going to get shot.

290
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:02,370
No,
I actually want to duke it out with 

291
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:02,370
Mike.
Get stomped.

292
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,700
Well,
you could get shot though.

293
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:08,820
Everyone has baseball bats,
but no one plays bass with the wrong 

294
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,580
kids from south that you could get shot.
Anybody get shot there too.

295
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,480
But you do definitely see like more 
fistfights there.

296
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:17,950
Yeah.
I always think of you as in New York 

297
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:18,010
while I was born in Jersey.
But uh,

298
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:20,560
I mean I got better in New York when I 
was in,

299
00:13:20,561 --> 00:13:25,561
but I developed in Boston,
but I was only there for four years 

300
00:13:25,561 --> 00:13:26,300
doing stand up,
you know,

301
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,510
I moved to New York only four years into
my act was.

302
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,820
And I got a manager so that my manager,
who's still my manager,

303
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,000
so state it was selling me as a 
headliner,

304
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,530
but I wasn't really a headliner yet.

305
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,510
You didn't have the minutes.
You probably had the talent.

306
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:45,520
But I had a good solid 15 to 40 if the 
ground was right.

307
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,590
Remember the first time this guy,
Hiram cast and crew,

308
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:53,350
I remember that guy got me a Gig for a 
$75.

309
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,660
I had to do 45 minutes.
I said I only have 25.

310
00:13:55,661 --> 00:13:56,740
He goes like,
you know,

311
00:13:56,741 --> 00:14:00,310
like Jesus with the fishes that goes,
go out there and do it.

312
00:14:00,311 --> 00:14:03,170
It will come.
It will come unto thee.

313
00:14:03,171 --> 00:14:07,600
And I don't know if it came you crowd 
work because I didn't have the time.

314
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,420
Oh yeah.
Those are silly days.

315
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,520
I couldn't believe people can do 20 
minutes.

316
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,960
When I had five minutes,
I got up 20 minutes in a row.

317
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,630
They don't.
What's the longest flat out set of?

318
00:14:19,631 --> 00:14:23,410
Just stand up you've ever done?
I'm not a real good at real long.

319
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,240
I probably an hour and a half.

320
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,100
That's about all you should do,
right?

321
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:31,150
I think I love a 45 minutes set crusher.
Right.

322
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:34,630
Just get off one them wanting more 
instead of.

323
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:35,890
Yeah,
I've done long.

324
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,920
I've done too long.
I used to do these q and a's at the end 

325
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:40,920
of my shows.
Yeah,

326
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,900
but that's different.
I thought that goes into some.

327
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:47,550
Nan was getting to sample,
used to do the people were falling 

328
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,370
asleep or bored.
They get bored or girlfriends are like,

329
00:14:48,371 --> 00:14:49,490
yeah,
you know,

330
00:14:49,491 --> 00:14:51,100
it's.
You can only taught nobody.

331
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:56,110
I don't care who are.
Maybe it was Charlie Murphy that said 

332
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:56,110
this.
It might've been.

333
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:59,740
Oh No.
His job did Charlie Murphy quota before 

334
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,550
I quote him all the time.
Get to know Charlie Murphy.

335
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:03,700
He's a deep dude because he really.
I don't know.

336
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:07,520
He said deep dude.
He says some pretty interesting shit.

337
00:15:07,521 --> 00:15:11,810
He's a great storyteller too.
He's a good guy around Charlie.

338
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,240
You would like Charlie Murphy.
Dom.

339
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:13,770
You would like.
Oh,

340
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,200
I'm sure.
Yeah.

341
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,080
It's always weird for those guys whose 
brothers like Tony Rock,

342
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,990
Chris Rock's brother Tony Rockets.
Fuck,

343
00:15:20,991 --> 00:15:22,180
he's great.
Yeah,

344
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,810
he's fucking funny,
man.

345
00:15:23,811 --> 00:15:28,811
I hadn't seen him in years and uh,
I saw him at the Improv and I had to go 

346
00:15:28,811 --> 00:15:29,380
up to them afterwards.
I got,

347
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,520
dude,
I haven't seen you in like a long time.

348
00:15:31,521 --> 00:15:32,900
Like I go,
God damn.

349
00:15:32,901 --> 00:15:36,230
You got good man.
Winton is it that makes you laugh?

350
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:41,290
Yeah.
Just some goofy in front of you with 

351
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:41,290
smart,
friendly on stage too,

352
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:43,770
like fun on stage.
Like you want to hang out with them.

353
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,540
I just want to have fun with them.
You know,

354
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,840
when you get to see a guys enjoying 
themselves up there,

355
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:51,050
it really makes you see when a guy's not
anymore.

356
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:53,060
It's one of the saddest things about our
business.

357
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:58,060
When you see a guy who's just doesn't 
even realize what he's got the greatest 

358
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:02,920
job of all time.
I know the other night I was late for 

359
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,140
work and I work 15 minutes and it was at
10:00

360
00:16:06,141 --> 00:16:08,180
at night.
I was taking a nap.

361
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:13,460
I was fucking late for work and I'm such
a hamper.

362
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:17,240
Fag that I was in the bathtub.
I'm so lazy.

363
00:16:17,241 --> 00:16:22,241
I was shaving.
I was took a bath so I didn't have to 

364
00:16:22,241 --> 00:16:24,461
stand in shape,
but it's almost like they're calling me 

365
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:29,850
on the,
on the cell phone thinking I wasn't 

366
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:29,850
showing.
And you're right around the corner.

367
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:36,080
Oh,
that's a real comic.

368
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,390
There's something about Comedians 
stripper time,

369
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:39,320
but I love it.
You know,

370
00:16:39,321 --> 00:16:42,230
it's like people need help.
People try and make it miserable,

371
00:16:42,231 --> 00:16:43,400
but it's got to be tough.
Huh?

372
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,980
Ain't tough compared to like work in a 
coma,

373
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:51,340
but going on the road,
I'd hate to be on the road all the time 

374
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:51,560
on going.
Nobody's asking you.

375
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,400
Nobody's ask Yo,
hey,

376
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,340
I hate to fly to Australia.
Nobody wants you in Australia.

377
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:58,160
What are you going to do when you get 
there?

378
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:03,610
You know what I mean?
Like people ever get people to try and 

379
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:07,931
make your life miserable.
Trying to like maybe make themselves 

380
00:17:07,931 --> 00:17:08,020
feel better about themselves.
Yeah,

381
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:13,570
there's definitely people that was 
trying to justify why they're happier 

382
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:14,120
than you and find the holes in your 
game.

383
00:17:14,121 --> 00:17:19,121
But as a professional comedian,
as long as you stay funny and the only 

384
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,050
way to stay funny,
you just keep doing what you're doing.

385
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,110
You'll never become a crazy person.
Keep reading shit,

386
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,130
keep writing,
shed.

387
00:17:25,131 --> 00:17:27,260
Keep watching things.
Keep coming up with new jokes.

388
00:17:27,261 --> 00:17:29,210
You're always going to keep doing it.
Yeah,

389
00:17:29,211 --> 00:17:32,300
but I mean I see guys like my age are so
bitter.

390
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:35,120
Bitter.
You fucking got away with life.

391
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:36,590
Being a comedian.
I though,

392
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:37,760
you know,
it's like I love it.

393
00:17:37,761 --> 00:17:39,890
I want to get better.
Well you're a,

394
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,790
you're a real comic.
Felt dumb.

395
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,880
You've always been a real comic.
Like the.

396
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,640
As long as I've known you,
you know,

397
00:17:46,641 --> 00:17:49,860
like I said,
I paid to see you before I ever even did

398
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:49,980
it.

399
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,980
Really.
You've always been a just like that's 

400
00:17:55,531 --> 00:18:00,531
what you are.
You're not like a guy who is trying to 

401
00:18:00,531 --> 00:18:00,531
get a series and if you got that series 
in,

402
00:18:00,531 --> 00:18:01,910
you'd abandoned stand up or a guy to be 
able to.

403
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:07,340
You always just domino,
rarer professional comedian from 

404
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,530
television.
Even introduce yourself like that.

405
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:13,940
Television doing well.
You know like I was wanting to Suzanne 

406
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,310
somers show when I came out here and I 
really liked her.

407
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,830
The show is really bad.
It's called cheese to sheriff.

408
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,690
She used to share.
Oh No.

409
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:24,660
Beautiful Blonde with big tits and she's
a sure that you get that Gig and uh,

410
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,400
at the end of the night they'd always 
want to go out.

411
00:18:26,401 --> 00:18:31,401
I go,
I gotta go to the comedy store and they 

412
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:31,401
go,
well,

413
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:31,401
why you already have a job?
I don't know.

414
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:33,930
That's my job.
This is my side job,

415
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:34,980
you know what I mean?

416
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:37,230
Being in the building of the Sitcom was 
my side job,

417
00:18:37,231 --> 00:18:40,260
my real job is being a standup like,
and that's the way I take it.

418
00:18:40,261 --> 00:18:43,650
Like even anytime I got series or 
anything else and I love acting,

419
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,850
I love working with people,
but I lost the standups.

420
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,880
My favorite.
It's the most fun thing ever.

421
00:18:47,881 --> 00:18:51,620
We used to talk about it after when I 
was doing a news radio,

422
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:56,740
you know,
I'd come back to the store and you'd be 

423
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:56,740
like,
yeah,

424
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:56,740
there's nothing.
Doesn't matter what you're doing.

425
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:01,291
I still want to go up there and kill.
I remember we talked about it because I 

426
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:05,451
remember because you were getting the 
series because I always practiced stand 

427
00:19:05,451 --> 00:19:05,451
up.
Oh yeah,

428
00:19:05,451 --> 00:19:07,650
Daniel Tosh that because he's on top 
with the comedy central thing.

429
00:19:07,651 --> 00:19:12,651
But he practiced the standups and 
wouldn't you know what happens when you 

430
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:12,651
get fired from a series?

431
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:13,260
We still got our job.
Right?

432
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:14,820
How cool is that?
Yeah.

433
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:19,821
The last thing you want to do.
I don't like being dependent on 

434
00:19:19,821 --> 00:19:22,041
anything.
That's why I was so nice not having a 

435
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:22,041
boss.
Yeah.

436
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,810
Well the best boss I've ever had for 
sure is the USA because they're there.

437
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:26,790
They couldn't be better people to work 
for.

438
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:27,990
I mean,
my eyes.

439
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:30,420
I've never had it.
I've never seen you so happy.

440
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,420
I love it.
Has Been.

441
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,930
You're so good at that.
You're so fucking sharp and,

442
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,850
and like you make it.
Like I was telling you,

443
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,680
you break it down,
you know,

444
00:19:37,681 --> 00:19:42,681
you make me understand the fighting more
while I try to explain it is if like 

445
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,890
you're smart friend is over that hasn't 
seen fighting,

446
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,960
but exactly.
I want to make it exciting for him.

447
00:19:45,961 --> 00:19:50,961
I want.
And I'm talking you through how I'm 

448
00:19:50,961 --> 00:19:50,961
looking at it.

449
00:19:50,961 --> 00:19:50,961
I'm looking at his path.
So I'm like,

450
00:19:50,961 --> 00:19:52,170
this guy's got this path.
He's got to secure.

451
00:19:52,171 --> 00:19:53,700
That arm has got to get his hand 
connected.

452
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,280
You know?
And when you bring people in like that,

453
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:56,850
you,
you're,

454
00:19:56,851 --> 00:19:58,620
you're with,
you're in is my mind.

455
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:00,870
I mean that's what's going on in my head
when I'm watching the fight.

456
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,640
Go Watch them out.
Needed a stomach.

457
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,770
There's something always got full mouth.
Oh,

458
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,730
I see it coming.
You know,

459
00:20:05,731 --> 00:20:09,480
I see like these paths and I want to 
just guide people through the path.

460
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:09,820
It's,
it's,

461
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:12,390
it's,
it's the most non job job I've ever had.

462
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,140
Oh,
I can see it.

463
00:20:13,141 --> 00:20:15,090
I can look like you're just floating 
through it.

464
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:20,490
I love it.
The thing I realized about myself was 

465
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:21,750
that I loved violence,
but it has to be real.

466
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,570
Like I don't like violent movies.
Did it,

467
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:23,800
did it.

468
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:28,130
Did to see Joey peshy a 60 year old guy 
beating up some 20 year old kid.

469
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,090
What the fuck?
No fucking bullshit.

470
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,990
I was there that night when you invited 
me to the pump.

471
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,940
These guys really getting fucking 
whacked and,

472
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,080
and you know,
you know,

473
00:20:37,081 --> 00:20:38,910
when it really hits,
the reality is when you sit.

474
00:20:38,911 --> 00:20:43,911
And like I told you,
I was sitting behind the guy's mother 

475
00:20:43,911 --> 00:20:43,911
and girlfriend when he got knocked out.
And the mother's like,

476
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,440
chew me,
you know,

477
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:49,600
like real fun.
I love the pounding they take.

478
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,820
Yeah.
It's odd that you remember the kid,

479
00:20:51,821 --> 00:20:56,821
the Tasmanian devil is just ran up the 
thing and did like flips over or do you 

480
00:20:56,821 --> 00:20:57,360
remember him talking about?
It was Kinda,

481
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,690
it maybe he was like maybe Mulatto or 
maybe from an island or something.

482
00:21:01,691 --> 00:21:04,990
He's kind of a light skin black kid and 
he was phenomenal.

483
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:06,020
He was,
he was,

484
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,200
he was leaping in the air like eight 
feet.

485
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:11,320
And I'm talking about jealousy.
I do.

486
00:21:11,321 --> 00:21:12,930
I can't believe I don't have his name on
the top of.

487
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:13,400
Hold on.
Whoa.

488
00:21:13,401 --> 00:21:18,401
But he was,
it was like they spread the camera up 

489
00:21:18,401 --> 00:21:18,800
when you were watching him.
He was a,

490
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,580
he was the one that knocked the guy out.
Yeah.

491
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,640
I have to.
I have to find out what his name is 

492
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,000
right now because he's fucking 
brilliant.

493
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:31,120
And he's an up and coming kid.
So just give me a.

494
00:21:31,121 --> 00:21:33,730
So while we're waiting,
let's talk more about supplements.

495
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:39,120
Hey Don.
What was it like meeting Johnny Carson 

496
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,120
was.
Do you have any stories of anything cool

497
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,700
that,
that,

498
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:44,200
that happened and the thing about it is 
that was like in 1986,

499
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,560
so that's when the tonight show is still
really big and it was not fun.

500
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,350
It was a,
it was an experience.

501
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:50,030
It was like a,
um,

502
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:52,980
an imprimatur of comedy.
It was an experience.

503
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,640
John John Shits,
sorry,

504
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,660
keep calling shiny shit.
Uh,

505
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,160
but Carson,
I wanted,

506
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,670
I looked in the hills and burbank and I 
wonder to run away,

507
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:09,120
I wanted to run away and start a new 
life like in the hills because I was so 

508
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:09,980
fucking afraid of getting on that stage 
when they.

509
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:15,250
Because Jim Mccauley,
the guide book that comes and talks to 

510
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:15,250
you and then they pull it back in.
There it is.

511
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:15,520
John Dodson,
sorry,

512
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,840
what's his name?
John Dotson.

513
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,180
That was the kid.
Yeah,

514
00:22:19,181 --> 00:22:21,800
he's amazing.
He's an athlete.

515
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:23,650
He,
he moves like a cartoon.

516
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,180
Flies through the air.
Yeah.

517
00:22:25,181 --> 00:22:27,400
It's just super talented.
He was doing that flip.

518
00:22:27,401 --> 00:22:28,960
He was like running up the walls.
Yeah.

519
00:22:28,961 --> 00:22:31,420
He's incredible.
He's incredible.

520
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,800
He's.
Yeah,

521
00:22:32,801 --> 00:22:34,770
he does like cartoon is shit.
It's like so,

522
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,460
like,
so gifted.

523
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,140
You know,
he's just got like a,

524
00:22:38,141 --> 00:22:42,760
almost like an acrobatic ability,
whatever you're saying,

525
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,220
you were terrified.
Just terrified to go on the stage.

526
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:49,780
Show is there,
the curtain go back and it's unreal that

527
00:22:49,781 --> 00:22:54,781
you hear Johnny Carson laughing and Ed 
Mcmahon a little and see I had done a 

528
00:22:54,781 --> 00:22:58,210
joke but that man and when,
when I saw him backstage,

529
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:03,420
he pulled me towards him.
I think I'll fucking head's going to 

530
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,090
slide me right before I go on because he
and I actually,

531
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:07,480
I didn't know that he loved the joke,
but you remember the joke?

532
00:23:07,481 --> 00:23:07,880
Yeah,
yeah,

533
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:08,260
yeah,
yeah.

534
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:09,360
It was like,
um,

535
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,620
you call them our,
what do I call?

536
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,110
I said I met Ed Mcmahon.
He's,

537
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:15,190
you know,
he's been in show business for 35 years,

538
00:23:15,191 --> 00:23:15,600
but what,
um,

539
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:20,730
what do I go up to them and say,
Hi ed calling Mr and Mr d dot Mr Eddie 

540
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:20,730
Mcmahon.

541
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:24,040
You big fat lucky town was kissing.
Johnny's asked for the list.

542
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:27,070
Thirty years you budweiser sucking out 
slinging nothing.

543
00:23:27,071 --> 00:23:32,071
What do you do?
I don't mean that in a way that was a 

544
00:23:32,071 --> 00:23:32,071
joke.
Right?

545
00:23:32,071 --> 00:23:32,380
And you know,
not a nice joke,

546
00:23:32,381 --> 00:23:33,250
but hopefully,
you know,

547
00:23:33,251 --> 00:23:38,251
he took it in the spirit that he was a 
big success and I was a new comic and 

548
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:38,251
that's the way he took it,
you know.

549
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:43,620
That's awesome.
I watched Johnny Carson every single 

550
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:43,620
day.
I never missed it.

551
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,460
And I was a kid and that was it.
There was no VCR is when I was a kid.

552
00:23:46,461 --> 00:23:47,720
But I would sit there and watch it 
everyday.

553
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:52,900
I think I remembered you from that.
When I first moved to La,

554
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,310
I met you at the comedy store and I was 
like,

555
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:57,820
from Johnny Carson.
Sure,

556
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,350
for sure.
Saw Young Carson,

557
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:02,750
a bunch of guys on Carson that wouldn't 
be in great comedians.

558
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,910
I saw Jenny on Carson for the first 
time.

559
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,920
It was a great community.
It was a great comedian.

560
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,670
Did Ed smell like Daniel isn't even one 
of the most underrated guys,

561
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:15,730
don't you think?
If you go back to the people wouldn't 

562
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:15,730
know,
but they'd know they'd go,

563
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:16,250
yeah,
that guy.

564
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,390
But yeah,
as far as like,

565
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:18,740
uh.
Do you remember how good,

566
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:21,380
how strong his act was in the late 
eighties,

567
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,870
the late eighties,
the eighties.

568
00:24:23,871 --> 00:24:26,120
Like in the early nineties,
he would go,

569
00:24:26,121 --> 00:24:29,670
he went to East side comedy club and 
they said he did a,

570
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:32,840
he did three different shows in a row,
three complete different hours,

571
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,240
completely different from beginning to 
end.

572
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:41,100
And he was mad at me for like 10,
15 years because when he started out he 

573
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:45,881
only had 25 minutes,
like a lot of us and I had to cover for 

574
00:24:45,881 --> 00:24:45,881
him and me and this guy,
Mitch Walters,

575
00:24:45,881 --> 00:24:48,650
we were in Florida and at this place 
called the comic strip.

576
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,390
And he would,
he would,

577
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,600
we used to say we'd squirrel his money 
in the daytime.

578
00:24:53,601 --> 00:24:58,601
We would buy all the food for the place.
Then he buys chicks it not buy drinks 

579
00:24:58,601 --> 00:25:02,441
for chicks at night.
And so we started calling them squirrel 

580
00:25:02,441 --> 00:25:02,860
and you know,
it was just like normal ball Boston,

581
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,930
like very mild hazing.
But he took it real seriously and he was

582
00:25:05,931 --> 00:25:08,600
hurt and he was,
he was mad for years ago.

583
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,890
But Richard,
we're just kidding.

584
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:10,720
But,
you know,

585
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:11,910
he was kind of,
I mean,

586
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:17,260
I didn't know that he was,
it was so psychotic that he was in that 

587
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:17,510
kind of pain that he would shoot 
himself.

588
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:18,520
But,
you know,

589
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,640
he,
I did see symptoms of incredible 

590
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,500
insecurity and incredible holding onto 
things,

591
00:25:24,501 --> 00:25:26,040
you know.
Uh,

592
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:31,250
but I mean,
that's so common with like really good 

593
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:31,250
comics,
isn't it?

594
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:31,250
There's so many good comments.

595
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,820
So just sell fucking nutty,
you know,

596
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,000
all of us are.
I mean,

597
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:38,300
I,
I straddled reality a lot.

598
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,650
I mean,
it wasn't for alcohol and Xanax.

599
00:25:42,651 --> 00:25:47,651
I mean,
I wouldn't go out of the house half the 

600
00:25:47,651 --> 00:25:47,651
time.
Really?

601
00:25:47,651 --> 00:25:47,720
Yeah,
yeah,

602
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,520
definitely.
You have a boy or a girl,

603
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:54,550
phobic feelings.
I don't want to get internally at the 

604
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:54,550
oprah thing.
But when did that start happening?

605
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:59,580
Since I was a kid,
since I was really bandon than the 

606
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:02,360
yellowstone national park,
I was abandoned in the Grand Canyon.

607
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:04,660
So I have a fear of widths.
Uh,

608
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:05,850
I dunno,
I mean,

609
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,340
how.
I don't want to get too heavy,

610
00:26:07,341 --> 00:26:08,480
but yeah,
I've always had.

611
00:26:08,481 --> 00:26:10,320
And you don't have any neurotic.
You were up in bay,

612
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:11,780
you weren't really abandoned.
No,

613
00:26:11,781 --> 00:26:13,250
no,
that's just a joke.

614
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:15,650
It's not even a joke because the joke 
would be funny.

615
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:20,610
That was kind of shocking stage.
I would.

616
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:25,400
I would start laughing because I thought
you were like underneath that tree and I

617
00:26:25,401 --> 00:26:30,401
was thinking about little squirrels 
coming up and kissing you and try to 

618
00:26:30,401 --> 00:26:30,401
web.
Yup.

619
00:26:30,401 --> 00:26:34,240
I read this story recently about this 
guy who got killed by a bear real 

620
00:26:34,491 --> 00:26:37,250
recently and they had a track down bed,
did it?

621
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:42,260
It's happened twice in the last year and
the in in yellowstone,

622
00:26:42,261 --> 00:26:44,040
and it had to before,
since the

623
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,110
19 eighties.
It's pretty uncommon,

624
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:49,740
but this one unfortunately wasn't just a
kill.

625
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:53,400
They had eaten part of this dude.
So then you got to kill that bear.

626
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:58,660
That's a bear.
That's discovered that human beings are 

627
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,071
a food source and delicious by the way.
And easy to remember eating sophie out.

628
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:05,940
Hello?
Hello?

629
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,660
Did I lose you podcast fans?

630
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:10,310
Chrysler's not swan,
so it's the same thing.

631
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:11,740
Don't make you gay.
No,

632
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:16,100
the fuck are you talking about bear.
He's a bear.

633
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:17,280
Nevermind.
So the.

634
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:19,190
They had to track this,
pared down and kill it,

635
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:23,570
and they're all tagged anyway.
I don't think so.

636
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,230
No,
no,

637
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,120
no.
There's.

638
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,040
I think a lot of them are.
I don't think they've got them all.

639
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,870
I don't know how they deal with that.
You know,

640
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:35,110
it's kind of a weird thing.
This is this one wild area that people 

641
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:38,411
venture into,
but there's this huge dog things that 

642
00:27:38,411 --> 00:27:42,371
will occasionally fucking eat you,
especially if they catch you with their 

643
00:27:42,371 --> 00:27:42,980
cubs when they're with their cubs.
They get,

644
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:44,300
they get crazy.
Well,

645
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:49,320
what were you telling me before about 
the guy that beat up and killed all 

646
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,030
those bulls?
What's crazy about one significant night

647
00:27:50,031 --> 00:27:51,360
in your life?
Yeah.

648
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:52,520
He knows.
Somebody says,

649
00:27:52,521 --> 00:27:53,120
I got a story.

650
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,920
You got a story.
I'll tell you this.

651
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:58,040
Yeah,
I want to say the exact right number,

652
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:03,100
but I think it was something like 11 
dead wolves and he had shot a bunch of 

653
00:28:03,711 --> 00:28:08,711
them and then he had a apparently a run 
out of bullets or as gun jammed and then

654
00:28:10,761 --> 00:28:13,090
he beat a bunch of them to death with 
his butt.

655
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:18,480
So they found him and like 11 dead 
wolves and then eventually the wolves 

656
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,410
got them the rest of the pack killed.
Oh,

657
00:28:19,411 --> 00:28:20,810
they did get him.
Oh yeah.

658
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:21,830
He,
yeah,

659
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,830
he was a,
I believe I said a lot.

660
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,700
I said Alaska,
but it might've been wrong.

661
00:28:25,701 --> 00:28:28,610
It might've been Canada.
How many wolves were in that pack?

662
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:29,900
I don't know,
man.

663
00:28:29,901 --> 00:28:33,060
There could be 100 and another five or 
six.

664
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:38,110
Sometimes they're like 30 or 50,
but there had been super pacs cited 

665
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:43,001
recently in Russia that they're,
they're really getting scared of that 

666
00:28:43,001 --> 00:28:46,800
were in the hundreds.
And what's funny about that is they're 

667
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,690
all starving to death.
There's no fucking food out there.

668
00:28:47,691 --> 00:28:49,370
So they're sneaking into these,
uh,

669
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:52,100
uh,
industrial area or the farming areas and

670
00:28:52,101 --> 00:28:55,460
she's fucking up their cattle.
Just going in there.

671
00:28:55,461 --> 00:28:58,250
I mean,
we're talking about a hundred bowls just

672
00:28:58,251 --> 00:29:00,230
coming in in a,
in a mass swoop.

673
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,410
Could you imagine if you're living,
you're,

674
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:03,950
you're some poor.
Fuck,

675
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:09,100
that's a sheep farmer in Siberia or 
wherever the fuck you are and you're 

676
00:29:09,141 --> 00:29:12,260
just taking care of these sheep and it's
freezing cold out and hear him.

677
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:14,410
I

678
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:19,510
hear that stupid shit every day and then
one day you look out the window and 

679
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:23,600
there's 400 fucking wolves,
400 of them.

680
00:29:23,601 --> 00:29:28,601
Could you imagine 400 fucking walls,
that feeling of being trapped in your 

681
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:34,301
house with 400 wolves out there and they
just start jacking his,

682
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:40,450
tear them apart right in front of you.
I told you I made a confession of Joe 

683
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,000
this week that I didn't want

684
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,230
know.
I finally told them why they didn't come

685
00:29:44,231 --> 00:29:47,470
over his house because I was afraid of 
his pit bulls and you know,

686
00:29:47,471 --> 00:29:52,320
I know that all I pictured was the bull 
flying through the air and latching onto

687
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:55,270
my juggler and Joe's screaming.
He never did this before.

688
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,550
He really.
He's really a sweet dog.

689
00:29:57,551 --> 00:30:00,310
They pray with people.
Pimples are great with people.

690
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,560
I remember.
I remember you have to worry about one.

691
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,930
They slid under the fence and was biting
that other dog know he,

692
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:09,070
he.
I had to have my fence welded.

693
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:14,270
I had to have a bar welded around the 
perimeter of the fence because he 

694
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:17,191
figured out that he could get his head 
in and bend the bars just by sheer 

695
00:30:17,191 --> 00:30:18,220
force.
Yeah.

696
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:22,750
He had his.
Any animals that we either so crazy.

697
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:27,760
The kids that you have.
Imagine your little girl and then it 

698
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:27,760
burned.

699
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,770
I spoken to her in the eye and the dog.
You know what I mean?

700
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,330
I agree with kids.
It's very dangerous,

701
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:33,220
especially if they don't grow up with 
the kids.

702
00:30:33,221 --> 00:30:38,221
If they're not a baby with the kids and 
they get jealous is that they get 

703
00:30:38,221 --> 00:30:41,161
jealous and also they don't.
They don't think of it necessarily as a 

704
00:30:41,161 --> 00:30:41,161
human being.
It's small.

705
00:30:41,161 --> 00:30:43,060
It's a different thing and they might 
bite it,

706
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,240
you know,
and that,

707
00:30:44,241 --> 00:30:44,650
that,
that,

708
00:30:44,651 --> 00:30:46,210
that is possible.
If it annoys them,

709
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:47,310
they might bite it in,
in,

710
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,210
in a way that they would never bite a 
person,

711
00:30:49,211 --> 00:30:51,190
but they might buy the cat.
You know what I mean?

712
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:57,110
They're,
they're dangerous at any dog is 

713
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:57,760
dangerous.
It's not trained properly and especially

714
00:30:57,761 --> 00:31:02,761
dogs with a high prey drive except,
but they're so fun to be around.

715
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:08,790
They're so friendly and loyal and 
energetic and they're so happy to see 

716
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:09,580
you and they're so smart.

717
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:14,580
They're so smart dogs,
but unfortunately all that intelligence 

718
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:18,421
comes with a burden and the burden is 
the way they are ultra dogs and the way 

719
00:31:18,421 --> 00:31:20,020
they became ultra dogs as they raised 
them,

720
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,530
fighting each other and they killed all 
the ones that weren't superior.

721
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:26,270
They really just kept a strong blood 
lines,

722
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:31,440
you know,
so if you get a dog that's like a real 

723
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,121
fighting dog,
those are some of the smartest dogs 

724
00:31:33,121 --> 00:31:35,041
you'll ever have.
Bryan county used to have this pit bull 

725
00:31:35,041 --> 00:31:38,310
and it was like a direct fighting dog.
We bought it from a dude who fought 

726
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,160
dogs.
I was there with him.

727
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:44,520
We went and this dude,
they would gamble on dog fighting and 

728
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,010
the guy was explaining to us that the 
dogs don't die and he's like,

729
00:31:45,011 --> 00:31:47,230
you don't let your dog get killed.
And he goes,

730
00:31:47,231 --> 00:31:50,050
it's all about gambling and it's all 
about breeding.

731
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:55,080
The pitfalls that it to them.
He had been doing this for generation 

732
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,440
upon generation.
Apparently I bought some.

733
00:31:56,441 --> 00:31:58,780
Michael Vick was saying that it was a 
cultural thing.

734
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:00,100
Yeah.
I don't buy that.

735
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,700
Yield a lot of them by electrocuting 
them,

736
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:08,020
man.
That's the dark side of it is that they,

737
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,690
they take these animals after they,
you know,

738
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:13,240
got to fuck each other up and then they 
shoot.

739
00:32:13,241 --> 00:32:14,440
One of them were killed.
One of them,

740
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:17,140
the one that quit,
they don't even want them to breed.

741
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,960
He got scared and turned away from the 
other dog.

742
00:32:19,961 --> 00:32:24,961
They don't even want them to breed.
They want them to just fight 

743
00:32:24,961 --> 00:32:25,930
mercilessly,
fight until somebody pulls them off.

744
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:28,300
It's just a fucked up thing to breed 
into a dog.

745
00:32:28,301 --> 00:32:30,430
It's a fucked up behavior trait to 
breathe in.

746
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:34,330
There's this old frail lady in Burbank 
and walks her pit bulls,

747
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:37,360
two of them every day and every time I 
see it I'm like,

748
00:32:37,361 --> 00:32:39,980
that's not cool.
You have at least be able

749
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:44,980
to like if something happened to take 
care of it and that slap it with the 

750
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,150
white glove and not every pit bull will 
freak out.

751
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:51,220
Fuck other dogs up.
Some pit bulls are very well socialized 

752
00:32:52,491 --> 00:32:55,730
and well trained and you know,
they're exercised well so they're,

753
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,760
you know,
they get tired out and that's the 

754
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:00,760
important thing with dogs.
Two dogs are just like people,

755
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,460
man,
you got throw the ball for the dog,

756
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,470
you know,
you gotta give the dog some space,

757
00:33:03,471 --> 00:33:08,471
you know,
my dogs have a big yard to run around 

758
00:33:08,471 --> 00:33:08,471
and it's great.
They need that man.

759
00:33:08,471 --> 00:33:09,200
Dogs need,
they need to be able to,

760
00:33:09,201 --> 00:33:11,930
you know,
to just to blow off some steam.

761
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,460
Otherwise their tents,
you know,

762
00:33:13,461 --> 00:33:18,461
a dog into the house all the time.
It doesn't get to get out of those dogs 

763
00:33:18,461 --> 00:33:18,461
will bark and jump up in the air.

764
00:33:18,461 --> 00:33:18,710
They're fucking freaking out.
They're like,

765
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,380
Jesus Christ,
you keep me and locked them in a box all

766
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,160
day.
I'm a dog.

767
00:33:22,161 --> 00:33:24,290
I'm supposed to be out running around,
you know?

768
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:26,300
So if you have two pitbulls,
man,

769
00:33:26,301 --> 00:33:31,301
you better make sure that you put those 
fuckers through a good little workout 

770
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:31,860
routine.
I need to start bringing my dog here and

771
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:36,080
kind of dog just sits there and says,
ah,

772
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,690
have a dog who's in love with me.
He's gay and dog.

773
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:43,190
He actually,
when he sees me he goes,

774
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:45,010
oh,
you know,

775
00:33:45,011 --> 00:33:46,820
like real.
Is that fucker good?

776
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:47,780
Good.
I loved this gut,

777
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:49,160
but I mean really like,
you know,

778
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,020
they'll do dog bits like that,
you know,

779
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:51,920
that my act.
But I mean,

780
00:33:51,921 --> 00:33:54,650
it really is amazing how his reacts to 
me.

781
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:57,620
Whatever it is.
Yet dogs are beautiful like that.

782
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:01,030
That's why people like having them as 
pets or people talking about having like

783
00:34:01,031 --> 00:34:02,150
a pet bird or something.

784
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:05,170
Like what are you talking about?
Stupid snake.

785
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:07,080
Oh,
get up by the paradigm.

786
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,980
I went through a phase for awhile.
I just saw.

787
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:12,140
I met a really cool pair and I was like,
that's so beautiful.

788
00:34:12,141 --> 00:34:16,450
I want that in my bedroom.
And look,

789
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,730
I had a pair of ones climbed up on my,
uh,

790
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:24,770
my shoulder and I had a baseball hat on 
and he bit the little top button off the

791
00:34:25,311 --> 00:34:26,430
top of the handles.
Yeah,

792
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:28,610
that'd be fun to have around.
No,

793
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:34,420
I didn't buy one had claws.
I don't trust anything with claws.

794
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,560
Get the fuck out of here.
You know?

795
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:40,390
Come on.
God.

796
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:45,460
What kind of creepy thing you got in 
your life that's a falcon on your of 

797
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:50,290
this new one that they just discovered.
They just did the newest fossil that 

798
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:52,700
they've uncovered of the biggest bird 
that ever lived.

799
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:56,050
It was 30 feet long and weighed 3000 
pounds.

800
00:34:56,750 --> 00:35:00,640
It's giant fucking predatory.
The monster is grey goose chases.

801
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,360
Birds Dragon,
right?

802
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:03,980
Oh yeah.
If it's 30 feet long,

803
00:35:03,981 --> 00:35:06,530
that's what you're asking.
That's not a burden.

804
00:35:06,531 --> 00:35:07,610
That's amazing.
Well,

805
00:35:07,611 --> 00:35:09,950
it's covered in feathers.
It's really fucked.

806
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:13,130
Or dragons,
aren't they scale.

807
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:16,670
Maybe they were scales and we just suck 
at feather detections.

808
00:35:16,671 --> 00:35:18,980
You know what I saw last night?
Speaking of dragons,

809
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:22,460
I saw the wrath of the titans.
Is that what it's called?

810
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:26,570
The one is a last one.
Oh my God.

811
00:35:26,571 --> 00:35:27,410
Is it bad?

812
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:31,640
Oh my God.
Is it bad?

813
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,370
It's so bad.
It's so.

814
00:35:34,371 --> 00:35:38,040
It's so bad that you were almost like,
did you even this out

815
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,750
or did you just.
Did you laugh at it?

816
00:35:39,751 --> 00:35:43,900
Was that bad or was stunning?
It was stunning because it was for.

817
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,020
First of all,
the CGI is fucking incredible.

818
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:47,720
Okay.
As a CGI,

819
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:51,870
seems like they just put the entire 
budget on making it look bad ass.

820
00:35:51,871 --> 00:35:53,760
I don't usually even like three d 
movies,

821
00:35:53,761 --> 00:35:56,760
but this is a really well done.
Three d movie,

822
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:59,480
like a kids movie.
No.

823
00:35:59,490 --> 00:35:59,990
Well,
yeah,

824
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
sorta.
I mean it's like pg or something like 

825
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,000
that.
Maybe it's PG.

826
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,660
13 for violence,
sword fighting and shit.

827
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:10,980
A lot of the monsters were incredible.
They had this fucking dragon thing.

828
00:36:10,981 --> 00:36:12,870
There's two headed dragon.
Holy Shit.

829
00:36:12,871 --> 00:36:15,090
Was it cool?
Like really fucking cool.

830
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,490
There's good things about this movie.
The.

831
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:17,310
Yeah,
the monsters.

832
00:36:17,311 --> 00:36:22,311
It's like a CGI CGI videos,
monster porn film where the talking in 

833
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:27,590
between the fucking is way too long.
You ever see like,

834
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:28,590
come on.

835
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:31,370
Especially like if you're in a hotel 
room and you can't fast forward it,

836
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,820
you got to just like sit and watch these
dummies acts out this distinct.

837
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:36,180
She likes you,
kiss her,

838
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:39,060
kiss her.
I don't want to get rejected man.

839
00:36:39,061 --> 00:36:40,410
After Cindy left me,
I just,

840
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,600
I just don't have that kind of 
confidence anymore.

841
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:44,250
Well,
yeah.

842
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:49,320
I don't know.
What could I do that give you more 

843
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:49,320
confidence?
I liked the,

844
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:49,800
uh,
the lesbian,

845
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,720
they make me laugh.
And Lesbian Porn.

846
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:57,740
Yeah.
Especially like the mother daughter was 

847
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:57,740
sick.
Is that just.

848
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:57,740
Yeah,
that's fucked up.

849
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:02,450
Mother Daughter Exchange Club where 
these mothers take their daughters over 

850
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:03,660
to switch those.
The both go with older women,

851
00:37:03,661 --> 00:37:05,700
but the daughter ever seen that one?
No,

852
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,200
neither did I,
but I heard about it.

853
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:08,940
I wouldn't ever watch something like 
that sick.

854
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,910
I have it on my phone.
Yeah.

855
00:37:11,911 --> 00:37:14,870
I've saw one of them where a mother and 
daughter were sharing it.

856
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:17,700
Derek,
the mother was stuffed in the daughter's

857
00:37:17,701 --> 00:37:22,590
mouth and it was the daughter's mouth 
girl looked like her as the sun's Dick.

858
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:28,490
No,
I bet there's a video like that must be 

859
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:30,130
for real.
There's one for everything.

860
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,370
We've thought it up.
Somebody is already like,

861
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,290
come on.
My glasses.

862
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:40,160
Fetishes know that this foot fetishes 
were dudes only want to come on girls,

863
00:37:40,741 --> 00:37:42,420
feet,
fetishes,

864
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:45,170
wherever the people put fingers and 
guy's penis holes.

865
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,100
Guys like.
And guys like.

866
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:52,080
Then there's the other way around where 
you guys fuck girls,

867
00:37:52,081 --> 00:37:56,640
pee holes and like how is it possible to
get a dig inside?

868
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:58,350
There's videos.
Look at it,

869
00:37:58,351 --> 00:37:59,550
it's fucked up.
It's actually,

870
00:37:59,551 --> 00:38:01,450
people liked it,
but I look at them every day.

871
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:04,710
I saw a pop or rock thing happened last 
night.

872
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:06,540
This,
this is the craziest thing ever.

873
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:07,660
Okay.
Uh,

874
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:12,450
we're at the Improv and for comedy juice
and there's a big gang of comics outside

875
00:38:12,451 --> 00:38:13,560
of the Improv,
you know,

876
00:38:13,561 --> 00:38:15,240
and just hanging out smoking cigarettes 
and shit.

877
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:19,610
And across the street there's like this 
Mexican Tequila Bar and uh,

878
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,460
this some,
yeah,

879
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:26,720
some celebrity came was coming out and 
the valet put their car there and it was

880
00:38:26,881 --> 00:38:29,580
like Lindsay Lohan style,
Papa razzies everywhere,

881
00:38:29,581 --> 00:38:33,500
like fucking flashbulbs and fucking 
jumping on top of their car,

882
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,770
like around the cars,
you know,

883
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:36,010
like,
like surrounding

884
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,000
them,
like Zombie style.

885
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,520
And so they're in the car and they're 
taking photos of photos.

886
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:42,550
So all the comics were just screaming 
stupid shit across the street.

887
00:38:42,551 --> 00:38:47,090
Nothing like really bad ones.
It's like don't Princess Diana her and,

888
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:52,290
and uh,
like is that Lindsay Lohan and just 

889
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:55,111
stupid shit.
And so the car takes out and it's some 

890
00:38:55,111 --> 00:38:57,370
girl from I think a fast and furious to.
I can't remember her name.

891
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,250
Maybe even Mendez Menendez or something 
like that.

892
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,660
I don't.
I don't even know if that was her,

893
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:04,690
but I.
it's just not your first language.

894
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:07,130
So she drove by and she's smiling at.
It's like,

895
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:09,460
like how you guys were funny while this 
whole thing happened.

896
00:39:09,461 --> 00:39:11,530
So it was cool because all the comics 
like yeah,

897
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:16,580
mission accomplished and,
but then second they left all the Papa 

898
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:19,090
razzies is big gang.
Just fucking slowly started walking into

899
00:39:19,091 --> 00:39:24,091
traffic and cars honking the horn,
slamming on the brakes and they didn't 

900
00:39:24,091 --> 00:39:27,751
give a shit and they're just walking 
across the street and then getting up 

901
00:39:27,751 --> 00:39:27,751
into all the comics.
Face doesn't go.

902
00:39:27,751 --> 00:39:28,910
You got fucking problems.
And like,

903
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:30,580
like they were like,
yeah.

904
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:33,700
Then they were all about to like fucking
just start beating the shit out.

905
00:39:33,701 --> 00:39:36,690
All these fat improv comic guys.
Aggressive pumper Raj.

906
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,810
Yeah.
It was crazy.

907
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:43,120
And then I pulled out my iphone and I 
started recording it because that's what

908
00:39:43,121 --> 00:39:45,290
I thought I would do.
But unfortunately the,

909
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,130
the facetime was facing me but I didn't 
notice it.

910
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,500
So it's just my physical.

911
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,010
But then halfway through it I look over,
I'm like,

912
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:59,040
oh fuck.
And I turned it over and then I show 

913
00:39:59,040 --> 00:39:59,040
them all like walking away,
like gang style,

914
00:39:59,040 --> 00:39:59,980
like walking through the street,
like a fucking gang fight.

915
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:01,750
Right.
It was fucking crazy.

916
00:40:01,751 --> 00:40:02,580
So then,
uh,

917
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:04,450
uh,
once they all,

918
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:09,690
they all take off and selling,
one of the paparazzis came back on this 

919
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:10,030
motorcycle going down the wrong way of 
melrose.

920
00:40:10,031 --> 00:40:12,820
It was like in and out of cars,
like scary.

921
00:40:12,821 --> 00:40:16,480
It was scary as fuck slams on brakes 
across street talks to the valets points

922
00:40:16,481 --> 00:40:21,481
over to us and then fucking just takes 
off and blows through like two red 

923
00:40:21,481 --> 00:40:21,481
lights.
And I was just like,

924
00:40:21,481 --> 00:40:24,320
what the fuck are these pop razzing 
expect getting them.

925
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,590
It was scary,
dude.

926
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:28,060
It was like,
I was just sitting there going,

927
00:40:28,061 --> 00:40:33,061
what the,
like you gotta think who these people 

928
00:40:33,061 --> 00:40:33,061
are.

929
00:40:33,061 --> 00:40:33,240
People their stockers or professional 
stalkers.

930
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,960
They're fun.
They're terrifying.

931
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,810
Those guys are terrified.
They're also,

932
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:40,150
I think they have to fortify because a 
lot of people like lash out at them.

933
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:41,130
Yeah.
You know.

934
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:46,410
Well now I don't,
like you mentioned being in Lindsay 

935
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:46,410
Lohan.
No,

936
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:46,410
or somebody like that and just have that
shit happened to them.

937
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:50,080
That's scary about it is a better at 
that.

938
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:55,110
What would you do?
That's why I think the aids blood thing 

939
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:55,110
I was talking about,
but you had aids blend just started like

940
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:55,540
going in and around.
Really.

941
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,940
Honestly,
I don't think it should be legal to have

942
00:40:57,941 --> 00:41:02,941
a gang of people just standing out there
with a camera and photographing someone 

943
00:41:02,941 --> 00:41:06,361
like that.
Freaking people out and especially when 

944
00:41:06,361 --> 00:41:06,520
they're walking into traffic like that,
like that should be something you should

945
00:41:06,521 --> 00:41:09,070
be able to get in trouble for.
It seems like,

946
00:41:09,071 --> 00:41:10,840
you know,
if you want to go bust pot shops,

947
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:16,050
pop shops are hurting anybody.
These guys are walking in traffic and 

948
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:19,591
big giant groups from freaking out.
Some chick it less and here's the big 

949
00:41:19,591 --> 00:41:23,740
and less the real and less and less.
She set it all up and that's exactly 

950
00:41:24,131 --> 00:41:26,260
what I was thinking too because it was 
like,

951
00:41:26,261 --> 00:41:29,950
why is this one e five people and none 
of us knew who this girl is.

952
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,630
I think that's what they do.
Look,

953
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:33,440
everybody's got to grind out of.
I don't.

954
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:33,980
I don't want to hit a

955
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:38,980
guy trying to make a living if the west 
wait and make a living as taking 

956
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:39,320
pictures of Eva Mendez or whoever the 
fuck it is,

957
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:44,470
as long as they're not really harassing 
people and I don't think they offer for 

958
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:44,470
the most part.
I think a lot of it.

959
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:48,820
There's a few that'll mean like clearly 
when Brittany spears was going bonkers 

960
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:52,370
and shaving her head and running around 
and beat and cars with a umbrella.

961
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:54,990
Clearly they were just following her 
there.

962
00:41:54,991 --> 00:41:56,900
There was no agreements there.
They were like,

963
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:59,780
let's follow this crazy bitch all day.
She's about to do something.

964
00:41:59,781 --> 00:42:00,680
Nobody,
you know,

965
00:42:00,681 --> 00:42:02,150
this is.
This is easy pickins,

966
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:07,390
but I know for a fact that people set up
fake situations where they tell someone 

967
00:42:10,131 --> 00:42:15,131
a Po,
a publicists will set it up with the 

968
00:42:15,131 --> 00:42:15,131
Paparazzi,
so the proper.

969
00:42:15,131 --> 00:42:17,240
It waits for them so they make it look 
like it's a big deal.

970
00:42:17,241 --> 00:42:17,610
You know,
like,

971
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,590
oh my God,
they're everywhere.

972
00:42:18,591 --> 00:42:19,940
I go,
what am I going to do?

973
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:22,910
Meanwhile they're fucking asking for it.
They're setting it up.

974
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:23,620
Of course.
Yeah.

975
00:42:23,621 --> 00:42:27,320
It's part of a part of the whole,
let's be famous thing.

976
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,190
It was scary though.
It to me that,

977
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,640
that if that was me that had that happen
to me,

978
00:42:33,641 --> 00:42:38,641
like with all the.
Because those people trying to pull out 

979
00:42:38,641 --> 00:42:39,020
in their car and it was just like 20 
people around the car.

980
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:44,070
They were like,
come on and get the fuck away from my 

981
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:44,070
car.
You know,

982
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:47,410
there's just like touching your car and 
shit and then that would dub and there's

983
00:42:47,591 --> 00:42:52,591
so much flashes.
How are you even being able to see when 

984
00:42:52,591 --> 00:42:52,690
you're.
We're trying to pull out into traffic.

985
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,850
The flashes alone,
those people,

986
00:42:54,851 --> 00:42:58,780
any flashbulbs going off,
all those people should be like tickets.

987
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:02,020
Like if there's like,
that's like saying that's like trying to

988
00:43:02,021 --> 00:43:06,040
distract somebody.
Fuck texting flash bulbs in your fucking

989
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:08,000
face.
Well it's definitely just the

990
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:13,060
giant mass of people that you say or 
blocking the traffic you shouldn't be 

991
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:13,060
able to do.

992
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:14,930
Would you ever want Lindsay Lohan on a 
podcast?

993
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:20,110
Why?
I think it'd be interesting to talk to 

994
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:21,971
her.
I think she thought I liked the skanky 

995
00:43:21,971 --> 00:43:21,971
blonde look.
I mean,

996
00:43:21,971 --> 00:43:23,060
she's got a beautiful,
a redhead again,

997
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,600
but then when she was blonde and it was 
obviously a little girl,

998
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:29,810
she still to stay redhead,
she might be the hottest.

999
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:35,140
So I contention about a lot of 
celebrities when Michael Jordan was at 

1000
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:38,170
his peak and I really believe that they,
they don't,

1001
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,850
they find people annoying,
but if they weren't,

1002
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:45,010
they weren't recognized.
They feel insecure during a moment.

1003
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:47,660
Here.
Don't bother me right now you think,

1004
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:49,250
but a lot of these guys,
some people,

1005
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:50,330
they definitely,
it's,

1006
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:53,690
it's like being recognized is a big part
of it for them.

1007
00:43:53,691 --> 00:43:56,960
It gives them a charge when they go 
somewhere and they get recognized,

1008
00:43:57,350 --> 00:43:58,480
you know,
we had,

1009
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:03,600
you know,
everlast with house of Payne who's on 

1010
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:03,600
the other day.
He's the exact opposite.

1011
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,310
He likes to sneak in

1012
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:08,010
favorite podcasts of all time by far my 
favorite.

1013
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:09,360
Thank God.
Damn good.

1014
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:11,650
This is too old to try harder.
This could be okay.

1015
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:18,100
I feel like we're real close now.
The reason why I liked it because he 

1016
00:44:18,661 --> 00:44:22,410
played live acute acoustics.
Job Pretty much got her own concert.

1017
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:24,480
It was fucking off the songs.

1018
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:29,830
New Songs we had not heard before and 
they were really good and he's a good 

1019
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:29,830
father.

1020
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:32,010
I was having heart palpitations.
They can do what you can't do that

1021
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:34,170
you love seemed so impossible,
you know,

1022
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:39,171
because when people go stand up comedy 
so hard and I'm thinking playing a 12 

1023
00:44:39,171 --> 00:44:43,971
string guitar,
like this neurosurgeon friend of mine 

1024
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,030
people left with,
you know,

1025
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,270
like we can't have a neurosurgeon for it
because we're like,

1026
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,290
you know,
joke monkeys.

1027
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,420
That's whatever.
I'm bad.

1028
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:50,910
I'm,
no,

1029
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:52,160
I just go ahead because I know what 
you're gonna.

1030
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:54,180
Say what he says I could never do.
You do.

1031
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:55,310
Exactly.
Yeah.

1032
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:57,330
I mean you always have neurosurgery.
I mean that's hilarious.

1033
00:44:57,630 --> 00:44:58,290
He said,
but he said,

1034
00:44:58,291 --> 00:45:00,960
I can never do what you do.
I said I didn't have released.

1035
00:45:00,961 --> 00:45:04,050
You can kid around a little.
You can kid around with your family.

1036
00:45:04,051 --> 00:45:06,150
Make people eat.
I can't do a little neurosurgery.

1037
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:12,730
It's true though.
You can't pop in the dor a as this was 

1038
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:12,730
getting the head cracked open.
Well,

1039
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:14,100
there's a lot of people that wish they 
were funny.

1040
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,680
It a lot of like really stayed.
A lot of people think they're funny,

1041
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:22,440
some people think they're funny,
but there's a lot of people that wish 

1042
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,681
they were and just for whatever reason,
they can't figure out how to how to do 

1043
00:45:24,681 --> 00:45:24,681
that.
What is that?

1044
00:45:24,681 --> 00:45:25,610
They take themselves too seriously.
I don't.

1045
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:28,890
I think that's diluted a lot of times 
that there was a guy,

1046
00:45:28,891 --> 00:45:29,400
he said,
you know,

1047
00:45:29,401 --> 00:45:30,840
I'd like to be a comedian.
He goes,

1048
00:45:30,841 --> 00:45:32,750
but I'm not funny.
I go,

1049
00:45:32,751 --> 00:45:33,230
well,
you know,

1050
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,220
I'd like to be a fucking trapeze 
artists,

1051
00:45:35,221 --> 00:45:37,320
but I'm not very acrobatic.
You know what I mean?

1052
00:45:37,321 --> 00:45:38,540
Like,
what if you're not funny?

1053
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:43,550
How can you be a comedian when we know a
lot of comedians that aren't funny but 

1054
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:47,601
they're successful because they know 
some of the tricks and they're good 

1055
00:45:47,601 --> 00:45:47,630
looking or they're good at marketing 
themselves,

1056
00:45:47,631 --> 00:45:48,010
you know?

1057
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,500
Yeah.
There's a lot of that.

1058
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,290
This is a lot of people that get to a 
certain level and you're like,

1059
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,120
wow,
they really got that far.

1060
00:45:54,121 --> 00:45:55,150
That's amazing.
Yeah.

1061
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,240
What was that?
You know?

1062
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:02,480
But they like piece together an act 
based on what they think is relevant 

1063
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,721
right now.
There's certain key things you can 

1064
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:08,781
always say and get applauses,
especially like if you're doing like a 

1065
00:46:08,781 --> 00:46:12,240
specific ethnic cultural thing,
say like you're doing like a Latino.

1066
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:14,430
Oh brother,
boom.

1067
00:46:14,431 --> 00:46:19,431
You know me and they'll say a couple of 
Spanish words and you get like a big 

1068
00:46:19,431 --> 00:46:19,431
thing,
you know what I mean?

1069
00:46:19,431 --> 00:46:24,351
You see?
But then you kind of see it with the 

1070
00:46:24,351 --> 00:46:24,351
talions.
I sit with blacks,

1071
00:46:24,351 --> 00:46:24,351
you know

1072
00:46:24,351 --> 00:46:25,590
what's up with that,
Melissa?

1073
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:26,930
You know,
man.

1074
00:46:26,931 --> 00:46:29,120
And the white guy who has a really good 
black.

1075
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:31,190
That's really good.
Are you serious?

1076
00:46:31,191 --> 00:46:31,580
Yeah.
Yeah.

1077
00:46:31,581 --> 00:46:33,920
That's pretty good.
I thought it was a black guy in the room

1078
00:46:33,921 --> 00:46:35,810
with me for a second.
You close your eyes.

1079
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:36,230
Go ahead.

1080
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:40,370
What's up?
What's up with people who say what's up?

1081
00:46:40,371 --> 00:46:41,300
Holy Cow.

1082
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:47,540
Yeah.
Don was the host of the,

1083
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:51,660
one of the first TV shows was over onto 
him and we did the thing in Montreal.

1084
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:53,010
That was it,
um,

1085
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,730
comedy from the danger zone or 
something.

1086
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:55,670
Right,
right.

1087
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,600
That was fun.
Yeah.

1088
00:46:58,130 --> 00:46:59,640
I remember bringing you up.
Yeah.

1089
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,890
That was fun.
Montreal.

1090
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:04,140
That was one of the best festivals ever.
That's a.

1091
00:47:04,141 --> 00:47:06,480
That was a fun festival.
I love that city.

1092
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:09,870
It's a great city.
Talk about fucking hot girls.

1093
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:13,590
Oh Lord,
my goodness.

1094
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,980
Even the ugly sister.
Beautiful.

1095
00:47:16,981 --> 00:47:20,120
There's a lot of pretty girls up there,
mark.

1096
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:22,160
Goodness is.
It's amazing.

1097
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:24,600
It was pretty one sheet myself.
Be Very Pretty.

1098
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:26,160
Ooh,
what's amazing.

1099
00:47:26,161 --> 00:47:30,790
Is it right below that as monsters?
Fucking main monsters.

1100
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,140
Really not weird monsters.
I know.

1101
00:47:34,141 --> 00:47:36,100
You know.
Not all monsters ladies.

1102
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:41,310
Don't get mad.
I met some pretty girls and mean don't 

1103
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:43,231
get me wrong.
Look when I go home after living in 

1104
00:47:43,231 --> 00:47:43,780
Hollywood and you see the staff at the 
laugh factory and you haven't been there

1105
00:47:43,781 --> 00:47:48,781
while there are standards,
the could be like girls with the laugh 

1106
00:47:48,781 --> 00:47:48,781
factory.

1107
00:47:48,781 --> 00:47:48,781
They're so beautiful,
right?

1108
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:50,700
I don't know who's hiring them,
but it's,

1109
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:55,730
it's either a woman who's not jealous of
other woman or a man because they're 

1110
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:58,170
beautiful and I go back to where I'm 
from and not that I,

1111
00:47:58,171 --> 00:48:00,100
you know,
look at me and it's not like I'm so hot.

1112
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:03,260
I'm Kinda cute and way,
but people look like,

1113
00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:05,350
like extras from the hunchback of Notre 
Dame.

1114
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:08,960
What I mean like they're shuffling 
around and shit and you know,

1115
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:11,230
you get used to this level of beauty.
It's out here.

1116
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:16,260
It's weird level of beauty two.
It's like a really hard to maintain 

1117
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:16,300
level.
Oh yeah.

1118
00:48:16,301 --> 00:48:17,250
You know,
Katana,

1119
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:22,770
Katana,
the Japanese restaurant next to the 

1120
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:23,020
store.
We were in Jones one night,

1121
00:48:23,021 --> 00:48:25,470
me and my friend and he says,
man,

1122
00:48:25,471 --> 00:48:26,500
she's hot.
I go,

1123
00:48:26,501 --> 00:48:27,400
yeah,
she's really hot,

1124
00:48:27,401 --> 00:48:29,300
but she ain't Katana hot.
What?

1125
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:34,330
I mean like there's all levels when 
there that's like the international 

1126
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:34,870
beauties.
There's a black chick,

1127
00:48:34,871 --> 00:48:37,540
there's an American Indian,
there's an Indian Indian,

1128
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:42,810
there's a white girl is ridiculously hot
Asian girl with a star Tattoo over 

1129
00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:45,070
eyebrow or something and you're like,
Whoa,

1130
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:47,560
my in a real movie.

1131
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:49,320
If I ever dated another girl,
I'm,

1132
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:55,220
I'm going to like olive garden,
ugly.

1133
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:59,490
Like I'm not gonna hide.
I think it's just too much work.

1134
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,490
I think I just need to be taken care of 
for a while.

1135
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:09,240
Like I did all these girls were.
I'm like having to like be a certain 

1136
00:49:09,531 --> 00:49:14,531
person and I do a bunch of shit,
like a lot of maintenance involved with 

1137
00:49:14,531 --> 00:49:17,330
dating,
you know,

1138
00:49:17,331 --> 00:49:18,230
like,
uh,

1139
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:23,380
just try harder and harder.
What does that mean?

1140
00:49:23,991 --> 00:49:28,991
Like just tired of trying so hard that 
if I ever break up with my girl or 

1141
00:49:29,061 --> 00:49:32,990
whatever and then like if I think the 
next girl my day is going to be a girl,

1142
00:49:32,991 --> 00:49:34,520
like a,
like in a wheelchair.

1143
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:36,230
Do you have a girl now?
Huh?

1144
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:36,860
Yeah,
sure.

1145
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:42,170
You do a little here and there.
So it's complicated.

1146
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:47,200
It's complicated.
So what I don't understand what you're 

1147
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:47,200
saying.
What do you,

1148
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,320
what are you saying?
You just want to be taken care of.

1149
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:49,540
You don't want to try.
Like,

1150
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:51,620
you don't want to move so much.
I don't like.

1151
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:55,580
I'm dating people way out of my league 
and so I think I need to go back to the,

1152
00:49:56,710 --> 00:50:01,710
well,
what is wrong with what's going wrong 

1153
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:01,710
with the dating people out of your 
league?

1154
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:03,740
It's the disbelief while you're fucking 
though,

1155
00:50:03,741 --> 00:50:07,170
what the Hell is wrong?
Person me to fuck you.

1156
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:11,180
What is it?
Besides that?

1157
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:15,890
It's a reality.
You let things slide more I guess.

1158
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:17,050
Oh,
you know what I mean?

1159
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:21,050
Slide with shitty with you and you take 
it because they're hot as fuck.

1160
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:23,720
I'm not and I'm not talking about my 
current situation at all.

1161
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:24,700
I know what you're saying.
Yeah.

1162
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,890
I'm just saying in general,
well,

1163
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:28,010
I've been thinking about it

1164
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:30,920
a lot lately is someone has to 
appreciate you as much as you appreciate

1165
00:50:30,921 --> 00:50:32,510
them.
If there's any sort of an imbalance like

1166
00:50:32,511 --> 00:50:33,950
that,
like if someone feels like they can shit

1167
00:50:33,951 --> 00:50:37,220
on you because you won't do anything 
because they have the upper hand,

1168
00:50:37,221 --> 00:50:39,020
the relationship because you'll never 
break up with that.

1169
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:44,440
There's a lot of people that get in 
those kinds of relationships and it's 

1170
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:44,440
fucking stupid.
That's a.

1171
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:48,271
that's a shitty way to live your life.
It's a cowardly way to live your life 

1172
00:50:48,271 --> 00:50:52,540
and that's why a lot of damaged girls 
will date guys that are way under them 

1173
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:54,740
and they do it on purpose to make sure 
that guy's not going anywhere.

1174
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:58,250
So a lot of times they'll meet like some
other dude and fuck them on the side.

1175
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:00,920
That's what happens.
I'm looking for a damaged girl.

1176
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:02,770
I really am.
I had a need,

1177
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:06,980
somebody flawed because at my age I 
can't go out with women my age.

1178
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,750
I'm not going to go,
come on grandma and flip over,

1179
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,920
you know,
I'm attracted to girls in their twenties

1180
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:15,980
now I'm a lot older obviously,
so it never stops and.

1181
00:51:15,981 --> 00:51:20,981
No,
but I mean what I'm saying is I need 

1182
00:51:20,981 --> 00:51:22,721
somebody with issues recently with daddy
issues or flawed in some way are so 

1183
00:51:22,721 --> 00:51:26,210
enamored by my tablet.
They don't look at me like the Mongolian

1184
00:51:26,211 --> 00:51:28,370
looked that I am.
You know what I mean?

1185
00:51:28,371 --> 00:51:33,371
I really got an annual thing going on.
I do look Gelica slapped my face,

1186
00:51:33,561 --> 00:51:38,561
God from eating,
drinking and I see you're actually 

1187
00:51:38,561 --> 00:51:41,560
trying to watch your diet now mean you 
had the Chorizo and eggs for one egg.

1188
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:43,740
Whites.
Egg was like,

1189
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:46,560
that's kind of counteract that.
Teresa did the same thing.

1190
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:50,180
Take weights and sausage.
Jerry's Deli.

1191
00:51:50,181 --> 00:51:51,680
So delicious though.
It's hard.

1192
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:56,710
You know,
let's have a cheat meal every now and 

1193
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:56,710
then.

1194
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:57,110
That's a good place to do it.
It's not for me man.

1195
00:51:57,111 --> 00:51:59,510
So close to the comedy store.
It's open 24 hours a day,

1196
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:04,100
three waffles,
best place on sunset as the standard.

1197
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,080
If they still have the same kind of 
food,

1198
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:10,370
I don't like it anymore.
You know what they add to tip to it,

1199
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:11,090
uh,
your,

1200
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:11,630
your,
your,

1201
00:52:11,850 --> 00:52:16,850
your food.
And I just looked at it the other day 

1202
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:16,850
and I'm like,
wait,

1203
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:19,961
how long have they been doing this?
They just kind of put the tip into your 

1204
00:52:19,961 --> 00:52:23,380
total.
So you gave him a double tip and for a 

1205
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:23,380
good year.
Good,

1206
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:24,590
good.
You did well.

1207
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:26,300
Good job.
I just don't like people that do that.

1208
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:31,480
Yeah.
Well they probably had to do it because 

1209
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:31,480
so many fucking drunks come out of that 
bar.

1210
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,980
Also people,
Europeans and Canadians.

1211
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:38,330
And that is sort of an international 
sort of makes sense that they know 

1212
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:42,731
everything about our culture and then 
all of a sudden they don't know about 

1213
00:52:42,731 --> 00:52:42,731
tipping.

1214
00:52:42,731 --> 00:52:42,731
Yeah,
they don't.

1215
00:52:42,731 --> 00:52:43,700
That's an alien to them.
It's a funny thing.

1216
00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:47,150
They know a lot of them knowing they use
it as an excuse.

1217
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,980
Yeah.
But it's weird when you ever go to,

1218
00:52:48,981 --> 00:52:49,790
you've been to,
uh,

1219
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:52,730
England and Irish many times you tip 
over there and they look at you like,

1220
00:52:52,731 --> 00:52:55,260
what you had done a lot.
I had American,

1221
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:56,480
you know,
remember ritual.

1222
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,680
Yes.
He said to me,

1223
00:52:57,681 --> 00:52:59,120
I got tipped in Scotland.
He goes,

1224
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:01,670
don't tip these people.
You're going to ruin it for all of us.

1225
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:04,610
Japan.
You don't tip in Japan.

1226
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:06,410
Oh No.
Yeah,

1227
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:09,770
it's weird.
It's weird how we do.

1228
00:53:09,771 --> 00:53:14,771
I.
Who else does it besides Americans to 

1229
00:53:14,771 --> 00:53:14,771
the French tip?
No.

1230
00:53:14,771 --> 00:53:14,840
Right.
Ten percent.

1231
00:53:14,841 --> 00:53:17,610
Maybe 10 percent of fresh is different.
There's.

1232
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:22,630
Well,
I mean there's a thing they're on there 

1233
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:24,011
for a tip and a lot of the credit card.
Well even Canadians are different 

1234
00:53:24,011 --> 00:53:25,640
because Canadians don't tip is about 
Americans because you know,

1235
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:29,460
wages.
Nobody to much American told me that.

1236
00:53:29,461 --> 00:53:34,461
That was what she,
that was her nickname for black people 

1237
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:35,080
or Canadians because they didn't tip 
just like an.

1238
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:37,910
Yeah,
that's an interesting phenomena.

1239
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:42,300
The black culture does not tip and I 
know the black culture,

1240
00:53:42,301 --> 00:53:45,740
but it is a portion of generally,
of course,

1241
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:46,590
all black.
I mean,

1242
00:53:46,591 --> 00:53:49,830
I've been out with Charles Barkley to be
a name dropper and he's ridiculous.

1243
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:52,000
Ridiculously generous.
He's a.

1244
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,220
he's a very.
God didn't gave me,

1245
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,260
this kid was late with the food.
Do you ever hear this story?

1246
00:53:58,270 --> 00:54:01,110
I know he was late with the food.
It took them a long time.

1247
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:02,970
Charles gave him a rolex.
Here he goes,

1248
00:54:02,971 --> 00:54:04,410
here.
Maybe this help you keep time.

1249
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:07,110
Wow.
That's cool.

1250
00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:10,640
Yeah,
it is.

1251
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:13,590
Unfortunately a stereotype though that 
fits,

1252
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:14,220
you know,
there's a,

1253
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:19,570
there's a video online of this girl who 
gets back from a restaurant and it's 

1254
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:19,570
like,
why?

1255
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:24,340
I think it's calling,
why I got a tip and have you ever seen 

1256
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:27,381
it?
It's got millions of hits and people 

1257
00:54:27,381 --> 00:54:29,350
were so in the fucking comments was a 
race war though.

1258
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:34,410
The goddamn comments were a race war and
she's basically,

1259
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:38,570
she's just being an ignorant dumb ass 
and you know,

1260
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:41,170
just flaunting and on camera.
Like wow,

1261
00:54:41,171 --> 00:54:43,390
I got a tip like who says who says I got
a tip?

1262
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:46,590
And someone came out and ran out and met
her in the parking lot and said,

1263
00:54:46,591 --> 00:54:48,270
hey,
you shouldn't be stiffing us.

1264
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:52,140
And,
and have you ever seen him pull it up,

1265
00:54:52,141 --> 00:54:55,920
pull it up because you want to hear 
about why I got a tip,

1266
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:59,280
waitresses tents up on youtube or the 
waitress was telling me how,

1267
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:04,340
like a lot of times the black girls are 
mean to them when they're in the 

1268
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:07,440
audience and my theory on that,
and tell me what you think is that black

1269
00:55:07,441 --> 00:55:12,441
women get stiffed a lot culturally and 
invite a lot of black men because part 

1270
00:55:12,691 --> 00:55:16,710
of a success in some eyes have some 
black men,

1271
00:55:16,711 --> 00:55:17,790
is to have a white chick.

1272
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:23,480
You know what I mean?
They're part of the culture until they 

1273
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:26,091
become a celebrity or something.
Then they got this toll Nordic blonde 

1274
00:55:26,091 --> 00:55:29,030
with them on some of this and say why I 
got tip?

1275
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:32,750
Why?
Why the fuck I gotTa to know?

1276
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:37,290
That's really why the fuck look,
look up whatever she's referring to.

1277
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:42,320
That's the one that is.
Why the fuck I got a tip like I,

1278
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:44,640
you know,
it's unfortunate.

1279
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:50,270
It's unfortunate that any culture would 
have an inclination towards being 

1280
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:50,430
stingy.
You know?

1281
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,320
That's,
that's unfortunate.

1282
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:57,980
I think the best thing that could ever 
happen to people in the black community 

1283
00:55:58,921 --> 00:56:03,921
that get,
get accused of this is for it to become 

1284
00:56:03,921 --> 00:56:04,350
embarrassing.
Then I'm all for it to become ridiculous

1285
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:05,460
before.
It's like,

1286
00:56:05,461 --> 00:56:10,461
you know,
like everybody should realize that the 

1287
00:56:10,461 --> 00:56:10,461
only way to prosperity is through 
generosity.

1288
00:56:10,461 --> 00:56:15,021
If you're not generous person,
you'd probably not going get anywhere 

1289
00:56:15,021 --> 00:56:17,550
and that you really holding yourself 
back by not being kind and not,

1290
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,290
not,
you know,

1291
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:22,320
not being generous to other people.
You know,

1292
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:25,630
it's a,
it's a shitty a aspect of any culture.

1293
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:27,910
But this one chick,
do you find it?

1294
00:56:31,610 --> 00:56:33,070
You see?
Those are all reasons.

1295
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:38,140
Ari's why the fuck I gotta do a search 
for why the fuck I got a tip jar.

1296
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:44,960
You got to get rid of this kid doesn't 
even have a goddamn laptop.

1297
00:56:44,961 --> 00:56:48,560
He's go this silly ipad thingy.
Thinks he's slick.

1298
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:51,620
I might be just be not on.
I don't even need it anymore.

1299
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:54,520
It's on man.
It might not be on youtube anymore.

1300
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:58,540
Like she pulled it down.
See it's,

1301
00:56:58,550 --> 00:56:59,890
I think it's called.
Why the fuck?

1302
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:02,470
Yeah,
and that those all reserves.

1303
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:04,420
Do you think somebody pulled it down?
Will you?

1304
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:07,010
People were so mad at her.
She probably did pull it down.

1305
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:11,170
Anyway.
Whatever.

1306
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:13,450
It's unfortunate.
And then,

1307
00:57:13,451 --> 00:57:18,451
you know,
I'll say this on the podcast and I'll 

1308
00:57:18,451 --> 00:57:19,990
get a bunch of things on twitter to the 
moon.

1309
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:21,910
People angry at me.
You know,

1310
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:25,610
a lot of black people chip in.
Will they actually do.

1311
00:57:26,030 --> 00:57:31,030
If everybody knows,
you're telling me that a lot of them 

1312
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:31,030
don't.
Yes.

1313
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:36,320
A lot of them don't tell them that's our
experience from living in new clubs for 

1314
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:36,700
the last 20 years.
Ya know what I mean?

1315
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:40,820
It's also true of the British and the 
Canadians and you know,

1316
00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:43,930
Italians are generous.
I got to say being Italian,

1317
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,490
they want to make sure people are 
looking though.

1318
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:46,510
I got A.
Yeah,

1319
00:57:46,511 --> 00:57:47,860
I got it.
I'm over here.

1320
00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:50,770
Yeah,
we'll wrestle for a fucking check.

1321
00:57:50,771 --> 00:57:51,190
You and I,

1322
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:58,460
I'm in.
Hilarity is next week in Cleveland.

1323
00:57:58,461 --> 00:58:00,590
You never went through hilarious and 
Cleveland.

1324
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:02,360
I know.
What did I do?

1325
00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:05,120
I did the Improv in Cleveland.
You'd love hilarity?

1326
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,410
Yeah.
Good place.

1327
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,690
Beautiful.
Rarely get to Cleveland.

1328
00:58:08,691 --> 00:58:12,950
I've only been there once with Charlie 
Murphy and Heffron were touring across.

1329
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:16,150
Great Guy.
Yeah.

1330
00:58:16,310 --> 00:58:18,410
You would like Charlie Murphy too.
I never met Sharon.

1331
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:20,060
I looked at me and him.
Yeah,

1332
00:58:20,061 --> 00:58:20,650
he,
uh,

1333
00:58:20,690 --> 00:58:25,690
he's got an interesting story.
That was the guy you want to have 

1334
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:27,290
fucking balls.
He got on the Chappelle show when he was

1335
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,140
in his forties.
Okay.

1336
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:30,960
He had no success up to that really,
you know,

1337
00:58:31,070 --> 00:58:32,980
a little bit here and there,
but really struggling.

1338
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:38,200
Got to the Chappelle show and all of a 
sudden started doing stand up and start 

1339
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,170
with headline and like within a couple 
of months,

1340
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,070
that's 45.
Oh,

1341
00:58:41,090 --> 00:58:45,030
Jesus Christ.
Nope.

1342
00:58:45,350 --> 00:58:46,530
It's a,
it's a,

1343
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:47,810
a bike check.
That's.

1344
00:58:49,550 --> 00:58:51,090
Well,
maybe it doesn't exist anymore.

1345
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:54,120
Maybe she pulled it down.
Doesn't matter.

1346
00:58:54,270 --> 00:58:55,660
Whatever.
Um,

1347
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:56,790
yeah.
She said.

1348
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:57,780
Oh yeah.
Okay.

1349
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:03,200
Well the point is,
it's unfortunate when people are 

1350
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,330
shitheads no.
And what was your theory about the black

1351
00:59:06,331 --> 00:59:07,800
girls?
They get shafted in life.

1352
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:13,000
No,
I think sometimes they get bitter 

1353
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,010
because they find that a lot of the 
black men become successful.

1354
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:17,270
Think of something.
This is not a general generalization.

1355
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:18,290
This is,
I mean,

1356
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,280
I mean this is a generalization 
obviously,

1357
00:59:20,281 --> 00:59:21,980
but sometimes like they,

1358
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:25,610
they find getting a white woman is an 
arm piece and a sign of success.

1359
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:28,610
You know what I mean?
It's a weird thing in.

1360
00:59:29,330 --> 00:59:32,480
Or maybe they just liked the way it 
looks or maybe they just want to fuck it

1361
00:59:32,481 --> 00:59:33,920
to the man.
Maybe just think of it.

1362
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:36,240
It's like some white dude to suppress 
them.

1363
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:41,030
Daughter fantasy.
Going on pound in it.

1364
00:59:41,650 --> 00:59:43,280
Do you think that's it Brian?
He keep nodding.

1365
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:46,140
I'm just trying to think of something.
Right?

1366
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:48,450
How big your next girlfriend's going to 
be a buck.

1367
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:49,630
70 bucks.
We love him.

1368
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:54,640
Going back to an average girl,
I got to get myself on average or less 

1369
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:57,731
than amber dating porn stars.
The the girl that I lost my virginity 

1370
00:59:57,731 --> 00:59:59,140
when she added me on facebook today.
Funny.

1371
00:59:59,150 --> 01:00:04,150
Is Porn star the term when you figure 
they could suck to Cox for the first 

1372
01:00:04,311 --> 01:00:04,610
time?

1373
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:09,660
Never Star.
Imagine the rest of show business that 

1374
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:12,371
easy.
I don't remember being called a comedy 

1375
01:00:12,371 --> 01:00:13,610
star and I did the tonight show.
You know what I mean?

1376
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:16,250
I had done hbo specials,
all this Shit.

1377
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:19,680
They're homemade comedy.
Struggling a comedian comedy store.

1378
01:00:19,710 --> 01:00:20,840
Yeah.
That is interesting.

1379
01:00:20,841 --> 01:00:25,841
It's like we're so uncomfortable with 
sex that when we throw the word porn 

1380
01:00:25,841 --> 01:00:29,711
around,
we have to have some nice star Pornstar 

1381
01:00:29,711 --> 01:00:30,710
rocket,
like a porn star,

1382
01:00:31,870 --> 01:00:32,480
you know?
Oh,

1383
01:00:32,481 --> 01:00:35,180
he's a rock star.
Do you still watch a lot of porn?

1384
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:40,550
No,
I try not to talk about camming 

1385
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:40,550
nowadays.
What about,

1386
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:41,810
you know,
but it's try not to.

1387
01:00:41,811 --> 01:00:44,900
But there was a worm that came out like 
Trojan,

1388
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:50,060
half a million freaked me the fuck out.
Last shouldn't get freaked out.

1389
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:55,170
She turned your Java off son.
You know what helped me was blood 

1390
01:00:55,170 --> 01:00:55,180
pressure medication.
Yeah.

1391
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:58,310
Because with blood pressure medication 
that lowers your libido.

1392
01:00:58,310 --> 01:01:00,860
So now I feel just like I'm like kind of
Irish,

1393
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:08,500
healthy sexually but not like fucking 
monkey who has the fuck everything and 

1394
01:01:08,781 --> 01:01:13,781
all the time and telling and genetics.
I mean literally we both have those 

1395
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:16,250
wonky Sicilian.
Yeah.

1396
01:01:16,251 --> 01:01:21,251
We have that.
Like if you get done fucked and you go 

1397
01:01:21,251 --> 01:01:21,251
home and jerk off thinking about what 
you just did,

1398
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:25,340
how much fucking sexy.
Like I remember like,

1399
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,000
you know,
sophie turned into me going,

1400
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:29,270
how much do you need?
You know,

1401
01:01:29,271 --> 01:01:31,280
can you just play with my ass while I'm 
asleep?

1402
01:01:31,330 --> 01:01:32,590
And she said,
oh,

1403
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:38,080
getting too comfortable with you.
Is it because of the Alfredo Chicken 

1404
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:40,370
Alfredo Alfredo sauce?
That's what the Italians are known for.

1405
01:01:43,490 --> 01:01:47,090
It's a,
it's caveman genetics is what it is.

1406
01:01:47,091 --> 01:01:52,091
It's very simple.
Was we look like trolls will short wide 

1407
01:01:52,091 --> 01:01:52,091
people.
That's,

1408
01:01:52,091 --> 01:01:53,550
that's a psyllium look,
you know,

1409
01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:57,050
wide fat head people.
That one,

1410
01:01:57,051 --> 01:01:57,850
Chris.
Fuck a lot.

1411
01:01:57,890 --> 01:02:00,980
Remember Christie?
Kristy was a redhead.

1412
01:02:01,990 --> 01:02:03,080
Yes,
she was.

1413
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:04,850
She had a great body.
Oh my God.

1414
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:08,610
She did we go into the wayback machine 
with diamond.

1415
01:02:11,470 --> 01:02:16,470
Get out of my way back when I got hard 
on 95

1416
01:02:20,230 --> 01:02:22,600
back in the desert.
I just got silk sheets.

1417
01:02:22,601 --> 01:02:26,230
Have Your own silk sheets.
What's one of those things is like,

1418
01:02:26,231 --> 01:02:29,020
why have I ever or done this before?
It is amazing.

1419
01:02:29,021 --> 01:02:32,350
Why would you ever have regular sheets 
that you're laying there?

1420
01:02:32,351 --> 01:02:37,351
It's like laying in this silky.
It's nice image.

1421
01:02:37,361 --> 01:02:39,430
I like to get out of my head.
I got to lie alone.

1422
01:02:39,431 --> 01:02:44,431
Naked.
You take your underwear off because 

1423
01:02:44,431 --> 01:02:44,431
remember the blankets to have this piece
on the end,

1424
01:02:44,431 --> 01:02:45,730
over one leg.
Remember this,

1425
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:50,760
the blankets that had the silky on the 
end used to be like put it against your 

1426
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:50,760
teeth when you were a baby and like all 
that stuff.

1427
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:55,700
You mentioned a whole blanket out that 
silky and you're was so amazing.

1428
01:02:56,620 --> 01:03:01,620
So it's only like $40 on Amazon.
I highly recommended just by some silk 

1429
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:01,620
sheets.
You'll,

1430
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:04,210
you'll never buy regular sheets again.
I don't think we'll get you a brian.

1431
01:03:04,390 --> 01:03:06,610
Do you do it all naked?
I do it all the time.

1432
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:11,660
Goes to buy sheets.
Can Imagine Joe going by and she had to 

1433
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:12,880
buy something for yourself to orgasm 
just with your penis on the sheets?

1434
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:14,900
Probably could.
Yeah.

1435
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:17,780
I mean it's really soft.
So where they get these uh,

1436
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:20,930
Amazon.
Amazon is satin sheets.

1437
01:03:21,410 --> 01:03:24,690
Fixture dom naked.
Oh,

1438
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:27,950
arm's flopping back and forth like a 
seal.

1439
01:03:29,910 --> 01:03:34,250
Oh,
you come from me.

1440
01:03:34,790 --> 01:03:36,500
I always love when they always say when 
you come from,

1441
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:41,520
you know what that means.
I'm getting tired with your and y'all 

1442
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:42,710
get off me fucking freak.
Crazy asshole.

1443
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:44,990
Hope next week South Park's all about 
this

1444
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:50,870
gang and silk sheets.
You don't taste.

1445
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,630
People were really listening hope so I 
think that would be so cool.

1446
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:57,060
It would be hilarious if.
Because the week before,

1447
01:03:57,061 --> 01:03:59,090
I think anybody who watches it,
if it would know,

1448
01:04:00,030 --> 01:04:01,270
no one knows what we're talking about.
Uh,

1449
01:04:01,390 --> 01:04:04,590
there was a.
we've talked about this bigfoot show and

1450
01:04:04,591 --> 01:04:08,190
then they talked about it on south park 
and someone on a message board said,

1451
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:13,220
oh,
someone from south park probably heard 

1452
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:13,220
you guys talking about.
I'm like,

1453
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:16,970
but hold on,
but anybody who watches that bigfoot 

1454
01:04:16,970 --> 01:04:19,610
show is going to get the same job,
but you're only missing half of it 

1455
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:19,610
though.
Well also in that episode,

1456
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:23,931
supposedly I haven't seen this episode,
but supposedly there was a part where 

1457
01:04:23,931 --> 01:04:26,961
it's like,
don't just hit your butthole is all day 

1458
01:04:26,961 --> 01:04:26,961
or something like that.
Cartman says.

1459
01:04:26,961 --> 01:04:29,190
And then the week before I have this 
whole thing at desk squad where I take a

1460
01:04:29,370 --> 01:04:32,160
take a piece of bread and I take the 
ICAT bread where you,

1461
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:35,130
I tell my fans to send me photos of them
taking a piece of bread,

1462
01:04:35,131 --> 01:04:40,131
taking a hole out of the middle of the 
brand and then putting their cat head 

1463
01:04:40,131 --> 01:04:40,680
through it and I've been doing it for 
about a month or so.

1464
01:04:40,950 --> 01:04:45,950
And then after that,
that last week's episode is all about 

1465
01:04:45,950 --> 01:04:45,950
like fucking cap reading and shit like 
that.

1466
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:47,930
No,
I didn't.

1467
01:04:48,130 --> 01:04:53,130
I didn't invent it,
but it was definitely a lot of people 

1468
01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:53,130
like a really small niche of the 
Internet,

1469
01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:54,150
you know?
It was just there on the Internet.

1470
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:54,750
Oh No,
no,

1471
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:56,510
I'm just saying that.
It's kind of funny that,

1472
01:04:56,590 --> 01:05:01,590
that,
that's something that I've been doing a 

1473
01:05:01,590 --> 01:05:01,590
lot lately on twitter,
but I'm not clear though.

1474
01:05:01,590 --> 01:05:02,690
Are you accusing them of watching?
No,

1475
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:03,210
no,
no,

1476
01:05:03,220 --> 01:05:03,570
no,
no.

1477
01:05:03,571 --> 01:05:06,990
Here's what I'm saying.
Last week when last week's episode,

1478
01:05:06,991 --> 01:05:10,830
it was really weird watching it because 
for the last month that's what I've been

1479
01:05:10,831 --> 01:05:14,130
doing on twitter nonstop.
So it was kind of cool to see that.

1480
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:19,460
And then this week I heard that they 
were talking about big foot and itching 

1481
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:20,380
assholes and I'm like,
this is getting cool.

1482
01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:23,880
I hope everything that we talk about 
becomes a cell phone.

1483
01:05:24,990 --> 01:05:29,990
They're going to do is an episode about 
a retard radio host who can't get his 

1484
01:05:29,990 --> 01:05:31,530
facts straight.
Cartman for something.

1485
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:34,060
We didn't really do a garden,
but did you say cat breading?

1486
01:05:34,170 --> 01:05:35,250
Cap Reading?
It's.

1487
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:40,390
It's so fun.
Are you talking about breeding breading 

1488
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:40,830
now?
You can take a crust of bread.

1489
01:05:40,850 --> 01:05:45,850
You make a hole in it and then put your 
cat's head through it and you take a 

1490
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:45,850
photo.
He's a grown man.

1491
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:48,030
Who isn't that strange?
It's just fun to know.

1492
01:05:48,050 --> 01:05:50,260
Don't tell them they don't make people 
like him in Philly.

1493
01:05:50,261 --> 01:05:52,660
Do they know?
Where are you from?

1494
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:55,290
Ohio?
Where a Columbus.

1495
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:56,310
Hello?
Columbus.

1496
01:05:56,380 --> 01:05:59,710
I when it's still in my Italian,
like growing up.

1497
01:05:59,711 --> 01:06:00,900
I don't need a new one.
Uh,

1498
01:06:00,910 --> 01:06:04,930
Italian.
It was my dad's best friend and he lives

1499
01:06:04,931 --> 01:06:06,730
in a,
I think Pittsburgh.

1500
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:11,940
And the only thing I would,
or only time I ever go to Pittsburgh 

1501
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:15,151
back and forth,
once a year we'd go and they have this 

1502
01:06:15,151 --> 01:06:15,151
huge party where he can just,
some fights,

1503
01:06:15,151 --> 01:06:16,720
all his families.
It was like the coolest thing ever.

1504
01:06:16,721 --> 01:06:19,540
That's how I know Italians were my first
time was that they were just,

1505
01:06:19,541 --> 01:06:23,740
had these huge parties with hundreds of 
family members once a year.

1506
01:06:23,741 --> 01:06:25,300
And we were invited to that all the 
time.

1507
01:06:25,301 --> 01:06:27,070
It was so cool.
Uh,

1508
01:06:27,430 --> 01:06:29,170
my first introduction,
Italians,

1509
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:32,500
the Italian American society,

1510
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:36,480
comes to see me every year at Columbus 
at the funny bone really.

1511
01:06:36,510 --> 01:06:38,460
And so they invite me to dinner that 
day,

1512
01:06:38,461 --> 01:06:40,440
the day I come in,
which is Wednesday.

1513
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:41,910
And it's always fun.
You know,

1514
01:06:41,911 --> 01:06:43,440
Dino,
Dino,

1515
01:06:44,150 --> 01:06:45,720
who's most willing to show that you did 
it?

1516
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:47,360
You've done the funny bone.
Yes.

1517
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:52,980
Anyways,
so I go to this thing and it's at the 

1518
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:55,520
Italian club and last long story short 
of fight fucking breaks out at a club.

1519
01:06:56,520 --> 01:07:00,120
But the club members wasn't like a club,
like a club in the public.

1520
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:04,170
They're having a vote for the president 
gets up and starts talking.

1521
01:07:04,490 --> 01:07:05,870
It's one guy goes,
you know,

1522
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:09,140
it escalated so quickly,
like,

1523
01:07:09,330 --> 01:07:12,650
like one of those the fuck you looking 
at nothing who you calling?

1524
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:13,920
Nothing.
Fuck,

1525
01:07:13,921 --> 01:07:15,630
you know,
that kind of like,

1526
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:17,090
you know what I mean?
I'm like,

1527
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:18,690
we're real close to it.
It was like,

1528
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:24,080
you know what you were saying,
you were saying about how you've seen 

1529
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:24,080
things like your hell unflappable.

1530
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:25,020
You are like,
you've seen things right next to you and

1531
01:07:25,021 --> 01:07:26,940
it doesn't even faze you like the 
violence.

1532
01:07:26,970 --> 01:07:27,900
Oh yeah.
Let's see.

1533
01:07:27,901 --> 01:07:30,000
So many fights.
That's what happened here,

1534
01:07:30,001 --> 01:07:31,580
but it was such an unlikely place.
[inaudible].

1535
01:07:31,590 --> 01:07:33,180
It was like everybody's cheering each 
other.

1536
01:07:33,181 --> 01:07:36,780
They're all either either Italian or 
have to have some connection to Italy,

1537
01:07:36,810 --> 01:07:38,040
you know,
whatever.

1538
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:41,310
And a real fight broke out and I 
couldn't believe it.

1539
01:07:41,790 --> 01:07:43,590
And you know,
you want a piece of this.

1540
01:07:43,650 --> 01:07:47,610
I always thought that was one of the 
more unfortunate aspects of our culture.

1541
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:50,970
Italian Americans are very prone to 
violence,

1542
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:52,710
very rounded.
Fistfights,

1543
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:54,990
Italians and Irish and Italians and 
Irish.

1544
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:56,070
Irish in you,
right?

1545
01:07:56,071 --> 01:07:57,960
Yeah.
I got the best of both worlds.

1546
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:01,260
Three quarters as I am one quarter 
Irish.

1547
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:02,910
Yeah.
That's they're always like,

1548
01:08:02,911 --> 01:08:03,930
well fuck you,
look at it.

1549
01:08:03,931 --> 01:08:06,270
There's always a lot of that,
especially the east coast,

1550
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:11,720
although scruffy immigrants raised kids 
that carried a lot of those same 

1551
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:17,000
mentalities.
The east coast is definitely more 

1552
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:17,000
hostile.
Do people ever

1553
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,290
asked you about the mob?
Like you know it because you're.

1554
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:18,920
But,
you know,

1555
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:20,890
they were asking,
you know,

1556
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:25,900
I,
I get it all the time really well 

1557
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:25,900
because of where I'm from.
And like,

1558
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:29,951
you know,
like I lived in a poor black 

1559
01:08:29,951 --> 01:08:29,951
neighborhood in west Philadelphia.
We moved from an Italian neighbor,

1560
01:08:29,951 --> 01:08:31,610
mean like we were really connected to 
the mob.

1561
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:32,660
Yeah.
Were undercover,

1562
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:37,690
you know,
it's why we're in this row home in a 

1563
01:08:37,690 --> 01:08:37,690
black neighborhood.
But uh,

1564
01:08:37,690 --> 01:08:39,680
because we were the press whites,
you know,

1565
01:08:39,710 --> 01:08:44,710
which was a very interesting perspective
of life because people don't ever think 

1566
01:08:44,710 --> 01:08:46,220
about what about the white kids that 
were let back in a black neighborhood.

1567
01:08:46,221 --> 01:08:48,650
I was lucky because I played ball and 
they were all my friends,

1568
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:54,040
but you couldn't walk through there just
like a black kid couldn't walk through 

1569
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:54,890
the Italian neighborhood.
Is that fucked up?

1570
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:55,880
Yeah,
it's fucked up.

1571
01:08:56,180 --> 01:08:59,060
When are we going to move past that?
When you know the people,

1572
01:08:59,061 --> 01:08:59,850
they're all,
you know,

1573
01:08:59,910 --> 01:09:01,280
you like him?
Yeah.

1574
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:02,210
Oh yeah.
Of course.

1575
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:07,420
It's like any other community.
It's all about deciding who's going to 

1576
01:09:07,420 --> 01:09:07,420
be nice to,
Oh,

1577
01:09:07,420 --> 01:09:12,190
you know,
he decided these are the people we're 

1578
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:12,190
going to be nice to and you're not going
to be nice.

1579
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:12,450
Those assholes over there now.
Well,

1580
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:14,180
we were talking about how we were in 
Kentucky.

1581
01:09:14,181 --> 01:09:17,330
We were in Louisville and Louisville was
playing Louisville.

1582
01:09:17,331 --> 01:09:20,120
And how did that go when they were 
playing crazy?

1583
01:09:20,121 --> 01:09:25,121
They started a riot and cars,
cars on fire and shit.

1584
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:29,360
But the crazy thing is it's Louisville 
versus Kentucky.

1585
01:09:29,361 --> 01:09:32,030
It's like assholes.
It's ridiculous.

1586
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:35,450
You were in the same,
same stack as a fucking civil war.

1587
01:09:35,451 --> 01:09:36,980
This is the most preposterous thing 
ever.

1588
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:42,010
Yeah.
Well what I liked the same thing with 

1589
01:09:42,010 --> 01:09:44,140
Auburn and Alabama and they,
it took a tornado to blow through 

1590
01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:47,930
Tuscaloosa for those people to get in 
touch with each other.

1591
01:09:47,970 --> 01:09:49,190
You know,
the same people.

1592
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:54,250
It's crazy.
They're so prone to like hate the 

1593
01:09:54,250 --> 01:09:54,250
neighbor or eight to.
Oh,

1594
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:56,250
the hatfields and mccoys.
Yeah.

1595
01:09:56,251 --> 01:09:56,930
No,
I mean,

1596
01:09:56,950 --> 01:10:01,580
I said a onstage about Michigan in 
Columbus,

1597
01:10:01,970 --> 01:10:04,250
Ohio state's group balloon man.
Why are you even talking about.

1598
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:06,140
Yeah,
I've had people from Columbus Shit on.

1599
01:10:06,141 --> 01:10:07,790
People from Cincinnati.
Yeah,

1600
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:09,640
yeah.
Fuck Michigan.

1601
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:13,160
I hate them.
I don't know.

1602
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:16,040
Meanwhile,
we're all supposed to be Americans.

1603
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:21,520
All preposterous,
all these stupid fucking little 

1604
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:21,520
leaguers.
Mother's hanging out.

1605
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:21,550
Preposterous.
I said,

1606
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:24,260
I can't help myself.
You must be a Michigan guy.

1607
01:10:24,290 --> 01:10:27,080
He has a very prodigious vocabulary.
It's preposterous.

1608
01:10:27,081 --> 01:10:28,400
Has been the word of the month.
Oh,

1609
01:10:28,401 --> 01:10:28,780
is it?
Yeah.

1610
01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:31,370
I've been blasting it out.
Every time it comes into my stupid head,

1611
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:37,700
it gets into a groove where you can 
start saying words that definitely.

1612
01:10:37,730 --> 01:10:40,800
Because I remember when we used to say 
something else,

1613
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:46,440
Joe was the first one I ever heard say 
what ever bananas or whatever you was 

1614
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:49,460
the first one that made that inflection 
and it's spread all over the valley.

1615
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:54,500
What ever you did,
you were the first one.

1616
01:10:54,501 --> 01:10:59,501
Yeah.
You're the first one I ever heard.

1617
01:11:00,411 --> 01:11:04,160
Say it and then everybody started saying
it and then he didn't say it.

1618
01:11:04,161 --> 01:11:07,490
As much as I say,
I don't understand what you're saying,

1619
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:08,260
why,
you know,

1620
01:11:08,270 --> 01:11:13,270
you'd be talking about like something 
that would piss you off and you know 

1621
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:13,270
what ever,
you know,

1622
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:18,100
it's like the instead of saying whatever
you made that beat what ever and then I 

1623
01:11:18,421 --> 01:11:22,110
didn't know I did that.
I really have no idea.

1624
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:23,580
I get Joe,
I know you so much.

1625
01:11:23,830 --> 01:11:25,820
You know me very well.
My friends,

1626
01:11:25,821 --> 01:11:27,630
we've known each other a long time.
Tell me more.

1627
01:11:27,631 --> 01:11:32,631
Tell me more.
We'd known each other since the 

1628
01:11:32,631 --> 01:11:34,800
nineties.
We met back in the day when I was living

1629
01:11:34,801 --> 01:11:36,320
in New York.
I'm really bad at it.

1630
01:11:36,390 --> 01:11:38,050
Caroline's or at um,
um,

1631
01:11:38,370 --> 01:11:39,600
Amsterdam.
Billiards wants to.

1632
01:11:39,601 --> 01:11:40,920
We just ran into each other.

1633
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:43,440
Tom and railroad can shoot a hell of a 
game of pool.

1634
01:11:43,441 --> 01:11:45,240
Tell you that.
I'm going to start saying that.

1635
01:11:45,241 --> 01:11:50,241
Yeah.
That's what ever the pause that makes it

1636
01:11:50,791 --> 01:11:54,260
so unique and that caused the middle of 
whatever.

1637
01:11:54,350 --> 01:11:58,560
That's where all the brilliance lies are
used to crack me up when people go to me

1638
01:11:58,561 --> 01:12:00,220
a like,
whatever.

1639
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:02,880
Like you're going to take credit for 
that.

1640
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:05,730
And then you were the first one I heard,
but like people would say to me,

1641
01:12:05,970 --> 01:12:08,460
does it bother you that the sopranos do 
Bada Boom,

1642
01:12:08,461 --> 01:12:09,810
Bada Bang?
I go,

1643
01:12:09,811 --> 01:12:10,530
no.
They go,

1644
01:12:10,531 --> 01:12:11,830
well you did it before them.
I go,

1645
01:12:11,831 --> 01:12:16,831
well,
because I was around before the show 

1646
01:12:16,831 --> 01:12:16,831
started.
I didn't make up acting Italian.

1647
01:12:16,831 --> 01:12:18,300
Yeah,
I didn't make them forget about it.

1648
01:12:18,301 --> 01:12:21,210
You know why I was the first one that 
should forget about it.

1649
01:12:21,770 --> 01:12:23,600
I had the nastiest thing happened to me 
last night,

1650
01:12:23,601 --> 01:12:27,450
dropped my iphone in my beer and hold it
out real fast.

1651
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:32,510
And then I just did the first thing.
I thought of it like I'll suck all the 

1652
01:12:32,510 --> 01:12:35,480
beer out of the like sucking the holes 
like as hard as I thought it was.

1653
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:41,180
Shit was coming in my mouth.
But then like something like a slime 

1654
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:41,180
thing.
Flew mouth.

1655
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:45,641
I'm like,
was that earwax or what the fuck was 

1656
01:12:45,641 --> 01:12:48,351
that?
So I don't know if it was a orange 

1657
01:12:48,351 --> 01:12:49,610
hefeweizen or if it was a battery to 
have advisors.

1658
01:12:49,670 --> 01:12:50,400
Dude,
stop it.

1659
01:12:50,401 --> 01:12:51,760
It was a piece of orange.
Yeah.

1660
01:12:51,761 --> 01:12:54,330
But I was like,
like your beer.

1661
01:12:54,331 --> 01:12:56,400
And had a simple orange,
I'm your,

1662
01:12:56,510 --> 01:12:58,500
I'm going to be your Colombel and chill.
What's wrong?

1663
01:13:00,290 --> 01:13:04,380
What's wrong with him?
If there's anything wrong with them.

1664
01:13:04,381 --> 01:13:06,660
I've been working with his fucking ass 
off for a decade.

1665
01:13:06,870 --> 01:13:08,940
He doesn't use anything wrong with him.
He thinks it's me.

1666
01:13:08,970 --> 01:13:09,690
He was like,
you know,

1667
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:12,360
you just,
you're just tense from the east coast.

1668
01:13:12,570 --> 01:13:14,380
You crazy with all that karate.
She.

1669
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:18,370
The interesting thing is the word 
retarded convenience issues,

1670
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:24,060
but there is something we'll do respect 
to something retarded about you.

1671
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:26,510
Look,
even that basement looked at.

1672
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:29,650
He has kids my age difference.
Well I think so.

1673
01:13:30,230 --> 01:13:34,080
Everybody or a 37 year olds are rocking 
it.

1674
01:13:34,081 --> 01:13:35,410
Like,
yeah,

1675
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:38,730
I'm 37 and I rock it like a 22 year old,
which is different.

1676
01:13:38,731 --> 01:13:43,731
But what do you rock?
I'm rocking a Nintendo shirt right now.

1677
01:13:44,540 --> 01:13:47,340
Do you think.
I wonder if he's a Manchild.

1678
01:13:47,370 --> 01:13:52,370
You know what?
I imagine a lot of them work in the 

1679
01:13:52,370 --> 01:13:55,430
computer game industry.
A lot of Manchild in the comic book 

1680
01:13:55,430 --> 01:13:58,251
world.
You didn't know what your target market 

1681
01:13:58,251 --> 01:13:58,251
is.
You get this Gig.

1682
01:13:58,251 --> 01:13:58,251
I mean a bullet.
People.

1683
01:13:58,251 --> 01:13:58,350
Joe knows what the fuck you doing over 
there.

1684
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:01,860
One's and zero's talking.
By the way,

1685
01:14:01,861 --> 01:14:06,861
I'm going to start talking like dropping
a one or a zero in normal conversation 

1686
01:14:06,861 --> 01:14:08,190
just to put code into actually 
communication.

1687
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:13,740
Know what you're saying.
That what if you like to have the one 

1688
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:15,430
zero listens for a nuclear bomb when at 
the end of the time,

1689
01:14:16,050 --> 01:14:21,050
you know when someone deciphers all your
fucking sentences for the month to 

1690
01:14:21,050 --> 01:14:21,050
figure out a nuclear bomb.
Seven.

1691
01:14:21,050 --> 01:14:26,020
It's not seven dummy to one or zero.
You can't say seven out sloppy code.

1692
01:14:29,690 --> 01:14:31,540
The new shit.
Yeah.

1693
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:34,900
This is what I do with them.
Don.

1694
01:14:34,901 --> 01:14:37,150
I'm sorry.
Oh No,

1695
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:37,770
no,
you're good.

1696
01:14:37,771 --> 01:14:39,040
I think I could do better,
I think.

1697
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:44,080
What do you think I should do with them?
I would cut his hours down.

1698
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:47,320
Cut his so that he,
when he comes in,

1699
01:14:47,321 --> 01:14:49,450
he's more focused.
That's casting.

1700
01:14:50,330 --> 01:14:55,330
You do understand?
We smoke a shitload of weed before he 

1701
01:14:55,330 --> 01:14:55,330
drove Rogan.
Wait,

1702
01:14:55,330 --> 01:14:57,900
so you get to see it.
The medical.

1703
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:02,960
Uh,
I think for that show that's what's 

1704
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:02,960
important.
We both do what?

1705
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:03,470
What's your,
what do you have to say that your,

1706
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:08,480
your element is today?
How do you get medical look at 

1707
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:08,480
entertainment?
What's right with them?

1708
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:10,300
I'm not even.
What's fine?

1709
01:15:10,330 --> 01:15:11,750
What's your anxiety?
It's good.

1710
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:13,130
Uh,
yeah.

1711
01:15:13,131 --> 01:15:14,410
Yeah.
The whole world.

1712
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:15,390
Does that help?
Uh,

1713
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:16,390
no,
no.

1714
01:15:16,391 --> 01:15:18,550
It doesn't help me.
I don't have anxiety.

1715
01:15:18,630 --> 01:15:20,130
Um,
I do have um,

1716
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:22,510
uh,
definitely helps me go to sleep.

1717
01:15:22,660 --> 01:15:23,770
It makes food taste better.

1718
01:15:26,130 --> 01:15:31,130
I think the light's just playing a,
it helps,

1719
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:35,090
uh,
if you've got injuries via Achy,

1720
01:15:35,210 --> 01:15:38,890
makes you feel a little bit better.
Relaxes you find it relaxes my muscles,

1721
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:42,280
you know,
like Xanax,

1722
01:15:42,870 --> 01:15:45,020
they all like the.
We don't really know.

1723
01:15:45,030 --> 01:15:46,510
I don't like smoke.
Really.

1724
01:15:46,511 --> 01:15:47,170
You can eat it,
you know,

1725
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:48,840
you,
you can eat,

1726
01:15:49,380 --> 01:15:54,380
need to attack what you said.
You haven't smoked weed,

1727
01:15:54,541 --> 01:15:55,490
those sense,
uh,

1728
01:15:55,570 --> 01:16:00,570
for a very long time.
And if you take so much xanax you might 

1729
01:16:00,570 --> 01:16:04,981
just take a hit once just to see if it 
does anything for you and get that new 

1730
01:16:04,981 --> 01:16:08,221
stuff because this is a cheaper 
alternative that will probably drink a 

1731
01:16:08,221 --> 01:16:10,180
lot though.
I'm doing good.

1732
01:16:10,181 --> 01:16:14,830
I drank a lot.
He said it was like my vitamin you drink

1733
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:17,140
everyday.
Do you like Ed Mcmahon style?

1734
01:16:17,170 --> 01:16:22,170
I do and I'm hung over every day,
which is really a testament to my comedy

1735
01:16:22,211 --> 01:16:24,130
because it's great.

1736
01:16:24,130 --> 01:16:25,540
That's a great thing about being a 
comedian.

1737
01:16:25,541 --> 01:16:29,530
You can actually function as an um,
I'm way more joe then when we hung out a

1738
01:16:29,531 --> 01:16:34,531
lot.
I'm way more alcoholic then I think 

1739
01:16:34,531 --> 01:16:36,070
because I graduated to a hard hard 
liquor.

1740
01:16:36,490 --> 01:16:39,040
Oh yeah,
because of a girl.

1741
01:16:39,041 --> 01:16:40,540
I don't know where to go from here.
No,

1742
01:16:40,541 --> 01:16:41,340
because,
uh,

1743
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:44,980
my girl,
my sister died a couple of other things.

1744
01:16:44,981 --> 01:16:49,981
So.
But I find that to be a really fun 

1745
01:16:49,981 --> 01:16:50,470
habit.
You know,

1746
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:53,650
I don't like the hangover,
but I time it,

1747
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:54,270
I go,
well,

1748
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:55,470
if I go to sleep,
pick a hamper,

1749
01:16:55,480 --> 01:17:00,480
xanax and six hours I'll be all right.
Right now I'm a little dizzy from the 

1750
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,410
combination of the tranquilizer and the 
alcohol,

1751
01:17:02,411 --> 01:17:07,411
but I do feel better.
Are you supposed to take those two 

1752
01:17:07,411 --> 01:17:07,411
together?
No.

1753
01:17:07,411 --> 01:17:07,900
No.
How bad is it for you?

1754
01:17:07,930 --> 01:17:09,470
It's pretty cool.
It can stop your heart.

1755
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:10,200
Yeah.
You can tell.

1756
01:17:10,230 --> 01:17:11,060
You're like,
well,

1757
01:17:11,061 --> 01:17:12,480
it's worth it.
No,

1758
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:14,570
that's why I keep the time in between 
them.

1759
01:17:14,970 --> 01:17:17,000
It like six to eight hours.
I made that up.

1760
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:21,520
I totally made it up.
That's what I'm thinking.

1761
01:17:21,521 --> 01:17:25,280
That's what in the alcohol metabolize 
and about that much.

1762
01:17:25,460 --> 01:17:28,700
If I'm drunk I don't take anything.
If I feel drunk.

1763
01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:29,960
No,
I wait until I feel.

1764
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:32,600
But if you take the Xanax and you're 
under the effects of it,

1765
01:17:32,601 --> 01:17:34,940
sometimes they'll have a couple drinks.
No,

1766
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:36,740
no,
not usually.

1767
01:17:36,741 --> 01:17:39,080
I mean not.
So it's one of the plane,

1768
01:17:39,090 --> 01:17:40,720
maybe A.
Yeah,

1769
01:17:40,730 --> 01:17:42,950
it's one of the other hoping there's a 
doctor on board.

1770
01:17:43,970 --> 01:17:45,700
Yeah.
Yeah.

1771
01:17:45,701 --> 01:17:47,210
Um,
you shouldn't do that.

1772
01:17:47,211 --> 01:17:48,860
You should switch to.
We'd get off my back.

1773
01:17:48,861 --> 01:17:51,500
We didn't even know me.
Man.

1774
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:54,590
What is the main reason why you're doing
this?

1775
01:17:54,591 --> 01:17:56,330
What is the main reason for Xanax?

1776
01:17:56,330 --> 01:17:58,190
Xanax for anxiety,
anxiety,

1777
01:17:58,470 --> 01:18:00,050
anxiety,
know,

1778
01:18:00,910 --> 01:18:03,530
just like panic attacks.
When did these start?

1779
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:04,700
When I,
uh,

1780
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:10,340
when I was four for real.
This is a lesbian and raped one of my 

1781
01:18:10,340 --> 01:18:12,950
entire family.
They passed me around the room.

1782
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:16,690
They plugged me like a joint fleshlight 
joy.

1783
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:19,300
It just started pumping,
uh,

1784
01:18:20,010 --> 01:18:22,030
the eggs I always had.
Anxiety I was at,

1785
01:18:22,050 --> 01:18:24,140
I want a psychiatrist when I was in 
seventh grade.

1786
01:18:24,290 --> 01:18:26,190
Really?
I was thinking,

1787
01:18:27,210 --> 01:18:32,210
well,
that's why I'm here to rebuild myself 

1788
01:18:32,210 --> 01:18:32,360
and I'll be at hilarity next week and 
you could see me a captain.

1789
01:18:32,361 --> 01:18:35,670
Brian's the following two weeks at a 
time.

1790
01:18:35,710 --> 01:18:40,710
I went to a psychiatrist.
My mother sent me a psychiatrist and 

1791
01:18:40,710 --> 01:18:40,710
what was it?
Four?

1792
01:18:40,710 --> 01:18:42,190
I was in love with him.
No,

1793
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:42,500
I'm kidding.

1794
01:18:45,580 --> 01:18:46,740
I wish for,
you know,

1795
01:18:46,770 --> 01:18:49,910
pat anxiety,
panic attacks and wow.

1796
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:55,060
I have all the same things.
I went to the hospital about a year and 

1797
01:18:55,060 --> 01:18:55,060
a half ago.
I had to pull over and call nine,

1798
01:18:55,060 --> 01:18:56,360
one one on myself because I have an 
anxiety attack.

1799
01:18:56,420 --> 01:18:59,720
Really cost me a lot.
I hope you know.

1800
01:18:59,721 --> 01:19:02,030
I was kidding.
And he was high as fuck.

1801
01:19:02,090 --> 01:19:03,080
Yeah.
You've actually started.

1802
01:19:03,081 --> 01:19:05,450
Something's already started.
It's already starting to hit me here.

1803
01:19:05,530 --> 01:19:10,530
Yeah.
Well you were high as fuck when you 

1804
01:19:10,530 --> 01:19:10,530
pulled over.
I wasn't.

1805
01:19:10,530 --> 01:19:13,330
I just didn't eat all day.
You hallucinate A.

1806
01:19:13,491 --> 01:19:14,510
Yeah,
I was.

1807
01:19:14,511 --> 01:19:16,610
I was starting to see like trails and 
stuff.

1808
01:19:16,611 --> 01:19:18,920
I felt like I was having a heart attack 
the whole time.

1809
01:19:19,540 --> 01:19:24,540
I was like typical symptoms like and I 
was like holding my neck and I could 

1810
01:19:24,540 --> 01:19:28,701
feel my heartbeat,
but the thing that I didn't like the 

1811
01:19:28,701 --> 01:19:28,701
ambulance and they were like,
yeah,

1812
01:19:28,701 --> 01:19:28,701
there's something wrong,
and I'm like,

1813
01:19:28,701 --> 01:19:29,780
oh,
now looking back,

1814
01:19:29,781 --> 01:19:30,140
I'm like,
well,

1815
01:19:30,141 --> 01:19:30,760
how don't know.

1816
01:19:30,770 --> 01:19:33,470
You might've had a heart attack mean,
didn't know you were having a panic.

1817
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:35,150
I love these people that think they have
heart attacks.

1818
01:19:35,151 --> 01:19:40,151
They don't have chest pains,
don't even know what a fucking heart 

1819
01:19:40,151 --> 01:19:40,151
attack is going to have.
Chest pains.

1820
01:19:40,151 --> 01:19:40,980
They have a heart attack.
I get that.

1821
01:19:41,010 --> 01:19:42,260
You would think so?
I would.

1822
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:44,390
I'm pretty sure I'm was a smoker.
I get those too.

1823
01:19:44,391 --> 01:19:45,170
Sometimes.
You know,

1824
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:46,550
he's a smoker toe.
Oh,

1825
01:19:46,551 --> 01:19:47,750
you smoke cigarettes.
A lot.

1826
01:19:48,230 --> 01:19:50,610
Kids will workout.
Oh No.

1827
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:54,030
I'm like,
I'm pretty much like you.

1828
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:57,020
I didn't know I work out though.
Yeah,

1829
01:19:57,380 --> 01:19:58,190
I'll work.
Yeah,

1830
01:19:59,290 --> 01:20:02,020
I work at dawn massage.
You know what that is?

1831
01:20:03,060 --> 01:20:08,060
It's very low impact.
You can actually eat while you're doing 

1832
01:20:08,060 --> 01:20:08,060
it.
It's a form of.

1833
01:20:08,060 --> 01:20:11,681
I watched myself on a video just 
exercise and I exercise that I,

1834
01:20:13,130 --> 01:20:15,970
I consider masturbation working out.
Is this a bit.

1835
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:18,420
No bit.
I think you might want to throw that one

1836
01:20:18,421 --> 01:20:19,980
out and it's never been in.

1837
01:20:22,110 --> 01:20:24,570
What'd you say about working out?
What if you fuck pillars?

1838
01:20:24,571 --> 01:20:29,571
That's like working out.
So that's kind of any movement you do 

1839
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:33,480
more two minutes to your life on this 
planet.

1840
01:20:33,510 --> 01:20:34,650
Is that true?
Especially for him?

1841
01:20:34,651 --> 01:20:35,660
Yeah,
sure.

1842
01:20:35,670 --> 01:20:38,120
It's one step on a grave.
One by appeal.

1843
01:20:38,970 --> 01:20:40,470
Dead Man.
Dead Man walking.

1844
01:20:40,471 --> 01:20:45,471
I get.
I'm not taken care of this vehicle now 

1845
01:20:45,471 --> 01:20:48,770
he's just riding it and stuff and 
cheetos and do it a little shit.

1846
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:53,840
Beer and the cigarettes are.
The real issue was fucking unbelievably 

1847
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:54,260
bad for you.
Yeah.

1848
01:20:55,140 --> 01:20:56,160
Yeah,
they are really bad.

1849
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:59,400
You never get that right?
Should I go to sixth grade?

1850
01:21:00,090 --> 01:21:03,040
What did you do it for?
No,

1851
01:21:03,090 --> 01:21:08,090
I used to get.
My grandfather would get samples and I 

1852
01:21:08,090 --> 01:21:09,780
would smoke cigarette one after another 
in the fucking that we so dizzy.

1853
01:21:09,781 --> 01:21:10,600
It was like,
yeah,

1854
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:11,910
I thought,
you know,

1855
01:21:11,911 --> 01:21:14,400
you get high by smoking just like only 
after another.

1856
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:15,720
He.
I did,

1857
01:21:15,930 --> 01:21:19,830
but it's not a fun high.
You're dizzy or lightheaded,

1858
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:20,820
you know,
roll up.

1859
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:23,680
I never threw up,
but it's nauseating.

1860
01:21:24,090 --> 01:21:29,090
I threw up from chewing tobacco once,
so gross the baseball player spit that 

1861
01:21:30,571 --> 01:21:32,380
shit.
But it's on a rug.

1862
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:33,470
Yeah,
the astronaut.

1863
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:38,480
It's a rug.
It's not like grass where it gets 

1864
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:38,480
absorbed into the ground.
Right.

1865
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:41,930
What is that?
Are they allowed to spit it on the 

1866
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:41,930
astroturf?
They do.

1867
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:42,780
You see them?
Oh yeah.

1868
01:21:42,950 --> 01:21:47,950
Fucking nasty.
Remember that scene from the naked gun 

1869
01:21:47,950 --> 01:21:47,990
or something where the world starts 
spitting and.

1870
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:50,340
Yeah,
they're just hilarious.

1871
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:54,210
Fucking figured out how to do that.
Isn't it funny that that's legal?

1872
01:21:54,330 --> 01:21:58,140
Chewing tobacco,
but cocoa leaves our legal thing,

1873
01:21:58,770 --> 01:22:01,500
which is probably better for you.
Matter of fact,

1874
01:22:01,501 --> 01:22:04,290
it's definitely better for you.
I don't think people were eating chewing

1875
01:22:04,291 --> 01:22:09,291
cocoa leaves and getting cancer.
Have you ever see these new cancer 

1876
01:22:09,291 --> 01:22:09,291
commercials in?

1877
01:22:09,291 --> 01:22:09,680
Oh my God.
Scared the fuck out of here.

1878
01:22:10,230 --> 01:22:11,260
Have you seen that one,
Brian?

1879
01:22:11,650 --> 01:22:13,290
They're pretty bad.
They're all are.

1880
01:22:13,350 --> 01:22:18,350
They all suck.
Especially like when they have holes in 

1881
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:18,350
their throats and that doesn't make you 
want to quit smoking.

1882
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:20,730
Guys looking at a windows maybe.
How long have you been smoking?

1883
01:22:21,570 --> 01:22:25,710
Since I was 15.
But the idea of starting now,

1884
01:22:25,950 --> 01:22:30,420
after all we've seen that's really crazy
drinking every day like,

1885
01:22:30,421 --> 01:22:31,800
I don't know,
alcohol is bad for you,

1886
01:22:32,370 --> 01:22:34,620
but the idea of like figuring out.
I think I'll start this.

1887
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:36,780
I think I'll start this habit that I 
don't have yet.

1888
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:38,770
Just,
you know what,

1889
01:22:38,771 --> 01:22:43,771
what made you start?
Because you're saying you were way more 

1890
01:22:43,771 --> 01:22:45,330
of an alcoholic now than you were.
It's a progressive disease,

1891
01:22:45,331 --> 01:22:46,920
you know.
That's the fun thing about it.

1892
01:22:46,980 --> 01:22:51,980
Did you get better at it?
Do you ever decide to do anything about 

1893
01:22:51,980 --> 01:22:51,980
it?

1894
01:22:51,980 --> 01:22:54,590
Do you ever decide to slow down,
take whatever.

1895
01:22:54,870 --> 01:22:57,510
I'm hung over.
I quit until that night.

1896
01:22:57,670 --> 01:23:01,560
Then we had a funny thing.
I was on a tour bus,

1897
01:23:01,590 --> 01:23:03,900
remember when I was roping for sure.
Yeah.

1898
01:23:04,150 --> 01:23:09,150
We're funny thing that I created this 
waitress at the laugh factory about the 

1899
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:11,110
other night.
Me and my friend Ali,

1900
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:14,760
we never slept on the bus and were 
drinking all night and we go,

1901
01:23:14,770 --> 01:23:17,160
we got to quit drinking a.
okay,

1902
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:18,220
alright,
this is it.

1903
01:23:18,221 --> 01:23:19,620
It's stupid.
It's fucking killing,

1904
01:23:19,630 --> 01:23:24,630
killing our bodies.
And so in about an hour we're sobering 

1905
01:23:24,630 --> 01:23:25,330
up and we go,
you know,

1906
01:23:26,510 --> 01:23:29,070
men drink it for a while and it's night 
and scraping sober.

1907
01:23:29,071 --> 01:23:34,071
What do you say?
We celebrate our sobriety with the 

1908
01:23:34,071 --> 01:23:34,071
drink.
So that was,

1909
01:23:34,071 --> 01:23:36,530
you know,
that this girl the other night a,

1910
01:23:37,250 --> 01:23:38,800
the factor.
We did something like,

1911
01:23:38,830 --> 01:23:39,710
she goes,
I'm not drinking that.

1912
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:40,550
I said me neither.

1913
01:23:40,930 --> 01:23:45,930
All right,
well we'll have one as a reward for not 

1914
01:23:45,930 --> 01:23:46,770
drinking.
You don't drink.

1915
01:23:47,180 --> 01:23:49,120
I drink.
I don't drink a lot.

1916
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:53,800
I can take a shot man.
I can do shots.

1917
01:23:54,450 --> 01:23:59,450
Yeah,
I like to try to keep it as balanced as 

1918
01:23:59,450 --> 01:24:02,461
possible.
You could get addicted to just getting 

1919
01:24:02,461 --> 01:24:02,461
fucked up all the time and going 
onstage,

1920
01:24:03,050 --> 01:24:04,600
onstage stage.
Fucked up anything.

1921
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:07,210
I really lose it.
Quickness.

1922
01:24:07,211 --> 01:24:09,470
Yeah.
How many times he got upset onstage.

1923
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:12,430
Fucked up accidentally though.
Maybe 10,

1924
01:24:13,740 --> 01:24:15,190
maybe.
Maybe 20.

1925
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:18,610
50.
I hit,

1926
01:24:18,630 --> 01:24:20,620
you know when you know what's bad is 
getting drunk.

1927
01:24:20,650 --> 01:24:23,770
If you're going to do an hour because 
you got to pee,

1928
01:24:23,771 --> 01:24:25,270
you know,
you've got to really watch that.

1929
01:24:25,330 --> 01:24:28,120
That's true.
But I have A.

1930
01:24:28,370 --> 01:24:31,690
I'm not better as a drunk because I'm 
not nervous doing standup.

1931
01:24:31,870 --> 01:24:36,870
So alcohol does me no good.
It just dulls me and it and it slows the

1932
01:24:37,541 --> 01:24:39,370
quickness down the reaction a little 
bit,

1933
01:24:39,371 --> 01:24:41,670
you know,
supposed to timing on.

1934
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:46,940
I mean I'm,
I'm much better on coffee than I am one 

1935
01:24:46,940 --> 01:24:46,940
booze.
Yeah.

1936
01:24:46,940 --> 01:24:47,980
Because I don't have any fear of the 
stage,

1937
01:24:47,981 --> 01:24:49,090
you know,
fear of.

1938
01:24:49,270 --> 01:24:51,190
I'm going to get you some of this 
alphabet and stuff for real.

1939
01:24:51,191 --> 01:24:53,180
Take it before you go on stage telling 
an hour before.

1940
01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:55,330
What is it?
The stuff we're selling it on,

1941
01:24:55,331 --> 01:24:56,400
it's all.
Yeah,

1942
01:24:56,430 --> 01:24:57,310
I got bottles of it,

1943
01:24:57,830 --> 01:25:02,830
something the other day I was really,
it started doing where I'll order it 

1944
01:25:02,830 --> 01:25:04,940
like a vodka and diet coke and then I'll
tell the guy like everyday,

1945
01:25:05,210 --> 01:25:10,210
every three of them make them just diet 
cokes and so I don't even know when I'm 

1946
01:25:10,210 --> 01:25:12,980
doing it or not.
And I felt drunk at the end of the night

1947
01:25:12,981 --> 01:25:14,120
and I was like,
how many have I had it?

1948
01:25:14,121 --> 01:25:15,620
He was like,
you've had any auto and you've been here

1949
01:25:15,621 --> 01:25:17,060
for six hours,
so you're from.

1950
01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:21,600
So you couldn't have been yourself like 
it was psychosomatic,

1951
01:25:21,630 --> 01:25:23,800
but it wasn't even like I was like,
am I drunk?

1952
01:25:23,801 --> 01:25:26,020
I don't even know if I'm drunk or not.
Like I was confused.

1953
01:25:26,050 --> 01:25:31,050
Is he retarded?
Tell me this is the first time you're 

1954
01:25:31,050 --> 01:25:33,151
hanging out with them.
You don't know if you're drinking 

1955
01:25:33,151 --> 01:25:33,151
alcohol at any.
Are you liking my journey?

1956
01:25:33,340 --> 01:25:38,340
I understand.
You know what he's like as if this is a 

1957
01:25:38,340 --> 01:25:39,150
contradiction in terms.
He's a really bright retort.

1958
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:41,400
No,
that's what I mean.

1959
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:45,140
I don't know how else to put it.
Like this is exactly how my facebook.

1960
01:25:48,070 --> 01:25:50,980
That should be your new thing on your 
message board.

1961
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:54,910
Happiness of like a retarded kid,
you know,

1962
01:25:54,911 --> 01:25:57,490
the joy that they have with a smile.
He's pretty happy.

1963
01:25:57,630 --> 01:25:59,610
I'm pretty happy.
Go hang out with more.

1964
01:26:00,090 --> 01:26:00,700
Yeah.
Yeah.

1965
01:26:00,740 --> 01:26:02,470
Always hanging out with all this porn 
star friends.

1966
01:26:03,610 --> 01:26:05,460
You really fucking porn stores truck.
Yeah.

1967
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:10,860
The,
your scheme that they've been there or 

1968
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:10,860
they're not the girl.
Girl,

1969
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:10,860
girl,
girl,

1970
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:11,800
porn stars.
The girl girl.

1971
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:12,890
There you go.
The only as.

1972
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:15,340
Oh yeah,
yeah,

1973
01:26:15,610 --> 01:26:20,610
yeah.
You don't really have to do that from 

1974
01:26:20,610 --> 01:26:21,190
Regina.
And I know it looks like you would get a

1975
01:26:21,191 --> 01:26:25,690
kick out of that.
Yeah.

1976
01:26:25,691 --> 01:26:30,691
It's a weird world.
It's uncomfortable getting to know that 

1977
01:26:30,691 --> 01:26:33,010
world that with the normal to them too,
which is very strange.

1978
01:26:33,310 --> 01:26:33,920
Well,
it's,

1979
01:26:33,990 --> 01:26:36,280
it's so stereotypical.
That's the weird.

1980
01:26:36,281 --> 01:26:38,650
The weird thing about that world is,
you know,

1981
01:26:38,651 --> 01:26:41,950
a lot of them are very nice and you get 
to meet them and you're like,

1982
01:26:41,951 --> 01:26:46,951
wow,
this is just some nice girl who just 

1983
01:26:46,951 --> 01:26:48,970
somehow or another she found herself in 
some situation where she has this almost

1984
01:26:48,971 --> 01:26:53,971
insatiable desire for sexual attention.
And lot of that is because they were 

1985
01:26:53,971 --> 01:26:53,971
molested.

1986
01:26:53,971 --> 01:26:56,920
And then when you find that out,
it's a buzz kill.

1987
01:26:58,020 --> 01:27:00,590
Then you start feeling bad.
That humanized.

1988
01:27:00,820 --> 01:27:02,710
Humanize them.
You're gonna lose all your fantasy.

1989
01:27:02,770 --> 01:27:04,510
You lose your boner for sure.
When you,

1990
01:27:04,511 --> 01:27:06,160
um,
when you talked to some of them,

1991
01:27:06,230 --> 01:27:07,810
some of them say that nothing's ever 
happened to him.

1992
01:27:07,811 --> 01:27:08,860
And I believe in,
I think there's,

1993
01:27:08,861 --> 01:27:11,740
it's possible that they could need 
attention for other reasons.

1994
01:27:11,770 --> 01:27:12,730
Yeah,
a more.

1995
01:27:12,731 --> 01:27:14,410
I don't know,
maybe they just rationalize it.

1996
01:27:14,411 --> 01:27:15,090
I don't know.
You know,

1997
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:17,860
or maybe that's just their reality.
And they don't have a problem with it.

1998
01:27:17,861 --> 01:27:19,150
I'm not saying there's anything wrong 
with it.

1999
01:27:19,151 --> 01:27:21,690
I'm saying when you delve into that 
world,

2000
01:27:21,710 --> 01:27:24,130
it's gotta be something wrong.
Well,

2001
01:27:24,190 --> 01:27:25,970
a lot of times there is strippers.
Dean,

2002
01:27:26,010 --> 01:27:29,560
I never met who was really working their
way through law school.

2003
01:27:29,740 --> 01:27:32,950
Very rare.
Some of them do like a Mike Young joke.

2004
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:37,240
Yeah.
A bunch of genius trippers.

2005
01:27:37,890 --> 01:27:38,870
I never heard that.
Yeah,

2006
01:27:38,930 --> 01:27:42,440
I saw him last night.
Same jokes and no I didn't watch.

2007
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:43,960
Sorry.
I just talk to them.

2008
01:27:44,020 --> 01:27:45,970
But how would you ever like him at Ice 
House?

2009
01:27:45,971 --> 01:27:46,770
Would that be okay?
Sure.

2010
01:27:47,110 --> 01:27:48,720
Cool.
Why'd you bring that up in the air?

2011
01:27:48,730 --> 01:27:53,730
And I don't know if joe said No.
Yeah,

2012
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:04,180
this fucking guy.
Well we've talked about Mike Young so 

2013
01:28:04,180 --> 01:28:04,180
many times on podcast,
but we've never had him on anything.

2014
01:28:04,570 --> 01:28:06,930
He got his ass kicked one time.
Remember?

2015
01:28:06,980 --> 01:28:11,980
That was brutal.
He's got an interesting story about 

2016
01:28:11,980 --> 01:28:11,980
that.

2017
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:13,640
Yeah,
I mean I wouldn't want things going.

2018
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:15,380
Is that him?
I don't know.

2019
01:28:15,381 --> 01:28:20,381
It's not.
My phone is so not my phone at your 

2020
01:28:20,381 --> 01:28:20,540
phone or your phone,
Bro.

2021
01:28:20,580 --> 01:28:22,900
I don't even know where my phone is.
That's because it's fucking ran.

2022
01:28:22,910 --> 01:28:24,500
You crazy bitch.
He just had.

2023
01:28:24,501 --> 01:28:26,560
He was sucking on it.
Yeah,

2024
01:28:26,570 --> 01:28:28,110
I remember the whole thing.
You.

2025
01:28:28,630 --> 01:28:33,560
It wasn't stuffed it under your ass to 
work with them on a regular basis.

2026
01:28:33,561 --> 01:28:34,850
Tom,
do you do stand up?

2027
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:37,790
Yes.
On the road with Jodi.

2028
01:28:37,810 --> 01:28:39,860
Is She?
I know you told me you don't.

2029
01:28:39,890 --> 01:28:42,990
You don't believe he does stand up a 
well.

2030
01:28:43,310 --> 01:28:46,490
You find that shocking.
I find it a little clump.

2031
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:50,600
Uncomfortable to talk about what?
What's black and on top of the stairway.

2032
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:53,580
Well,
Christopher Reeves after a fire.

2033
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:57,570
That was really good like five years 
ago.

2034
01:28:58,390 --> 01:28:59,790
That's good to hear.
Good Krista.

2035
01:28:59,791 --> 01:29:01,380
Good.
Chris Christopher.

2036
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:07,840
Now you wonder why you get hate mail.
You wonder why people abandon a couple 

2037
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:09,840
of people from talking shit about Joe on
the message board.

2038
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:10,830
Oh,
by the way,

2039
01:29:11,540 --> 01:29:16,540
did you watch the podcast?
Your message board now has a podcast 

2040
01:29:16,540 --> 01:29:20,120
that Jay mute jason and Voodoo and 
Johnny rotten did do it themselves or 

2041
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:22,870
might fly up one day and go to.
We should do a gig up.

2042
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:25,740
That'd be awesome Gig in Seattle.
And then do the broadcast.

2043
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:27,330
Definitely.
You know,

2044
01:29:27,331 --> 01:29:28,970
it's a joke that I love.
Tell him,

2045
01:29:28,971 --> 01:29:30,450
what did you think of this?
Maybe you heard it.

2046
01:29:30,890 --> 01:29:33,300
It goes to psychiatrists.
Psychiatrists is.

2047
01:29:33,301 --> 01:29:34,200
What's the problem?
He goes,

2048
01:29:34,201 --> 01:29:34,790
I don't know,
Doug.

2049
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:37,570
I just can't seem to keep any friends.
You Fat.

2050
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:42,740
Fuck what?
You said you went to a psychiatrist when

2051
01:29:44,251 --> 01:29:46,110
you're 17,
if you've been in 13.

2052
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:47,790
Oh 13.
Really?

2053
01:29:48,060 --> 01:29:48,930
Twelve,
13 years.

2054
01:29:49,170 --> 01:29:50,640
Wow.
Have you been as an adult?

2055
01:29:52,260 --> 01:29:54,310
I'm not a psychiatrist.
Psychologist.

2056
01:29:54,820 --> 01:29:56,620
That's the kind of.
Don't prescribe drugs.

2057
01:29:56,621 --> 01:29:56,810
Right?

2058
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:00,360
Want to talk about that?

2059
01:30:02,140 --> 01:30:07,140
No.
Telling you like pot.

2060
01:30:08,300 --> 01:30:11,000
The xanax stuff.
What does it do?

2061
01:30:11,001 --> 01:30:11,960
It kills.
Anxiety.

2062
01:30:11,961 --> 01:30:13,430
Makes you relax.
That what it does.

2063
01:30:13,970 --> 01:30:15,170
Yeah,
it's great.

2064
01:30:15,171 --> 01:30:17,480
It makes you feel like you're.
You're a normal person.

2065
01:30:17,690 --> 01:30:22,690
What I've heard though is that if you 
take it and then you get off at the 

2066
01:30:22,690 --> 01:30:23,540
anxiety actually increases.
Well,

2067
01:30:23,541 --> 01:30:26,120
I wouldn't get off it.
So it's a daily thing.

2068
01:30:26,300 --> 01:30:28,850
Every day.
I had just heard from someone,

2069
01:30:28,940 --> 01:30:30,920
we were just talking about this and he 
goes,

2070
01:30:30,921 --> 01:30:34,370
I couldn't fucking imagine taking xanax 
every day.

2071
01:30:34,371 --> 01:30:36,770
He just said this to me because it makes
you sleepy.

2072
01:30:36,980 --> 01:30:38,360
I don't know.
I don't know what it does.

2073
01:30:38,780 --> 01:30:40,190
Is it do it?
Do you want to try one?

2074
01:30:40,490 --> 01:30:42,190
No.
Well,

2075
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:43,700
why don't we.
When we get in the car,

2076
01:30:43,701 --> 01:30:47,420
I'll give you one.
I don't think it's for me.

2077
01:30:47,570 --> 01:30:49,510
I've actually tried it now.
I'm glad that you do part.

2078
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:54,520
I'm glad I.
I'm telling you like I was telling you 

2079
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:56,121
before,
you seem so much more at peace with 

2080
01:30:56,121 --> 01:30:56,121
yourself.
I had a bunch of come down a lot.

2081
01:30:56,121 --> 01:30:58,400
I think it definitely helped.
I had a bunch of life experiences,

2082
01:30:58,430 --> 01:31:03,430
a bunch of,
a bunch of psychedelic experiences to a 

2083
01:31:03,430 --> 01:31:03,830
bunch of.
I'd be so afraid to do that shit.

2084
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:04,760
Yeah.
Why?

2085
01:31:05,210 --> 01:31:10,210
But because I'm a pushy registered,
I've learned it.

2086
01:31:12,340 --> 01:31:17,340
Uh,
the psychedelics changed me a lot for 

2087
01:31:17,340 --> 01:31:17,340
sure.
You know,

2088
01:31:17,340 --> 01:31:19,550
it's just,
it's hard to gain perspective.

2089
01:31:19,620 --> 01:31:22,880
I'm not sure I've done them.
I'm sure several times.

2090
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:26,780
It's not about bath salts as you don't 
even say that.

2091
01:31:26,781 --> 01:31:31,781
Brian fucking.
Somebody might hear that and it's some 

2092
01:31:32,211 --> 01:31:37,211
new fucked up drug they're selling.
It's like a cousin to crystal meth and 

2093
01:31:37,211 --> 01:31:40,781
they can sell it,
and what's even worse is that fake we'd 

2094
01:31:40,781 --> 01:31:43,630
that we'd.
I've been reading all the shit lately 

2095
01:31:43,630 --> 01:31:43,630
about that fake weed,
that synthetic,

2096
01:31:43,630 --> 01:31:45,020
synthetic weed,
how bad it is for you.

2097
01:31:45,870 --> 01:31:50,870
That was good about the part that you 
get is that you're getting it from an 

2098
01:31:50,870 --> 01:31:54,160
illegal place,
which means hopefully it's not tainted 

2099
01:31:54,160 --> 01:31:58,091
in anything.
I don't know why anybody would go to a 

2100
01:31:58,091 --> 01:32:01,510
really shady neighborhood and buy shit 
on for a drug dealer who may never see 

2101
01:32:01,511 --> 01:32:03,580
them again.
Why would you trust that guy?

2102
01:32:03,610 --> 01:32:08,610
Let me cut it.
You gotta do what you gotta do it the 

2103
01:32:08,610 --> 01:32:12,050
cheapest price you gotta do what you got
to pay when you're in a dance.

2104
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:17,340
One of them.
It's one of those sayings that he can't 

2105
01:32:17,340 --> 01:32:17,340
argue with you gotta do what you gotTa 
do.

2106
01:32:17,340 --> 01:32:17,820
It is what it is,
like whatever it is,

2107
01:32:17,821 --> 01:32:20,140
what it is,
what else could it be and what it is.

2108
01:32:20,620 --> 01:32:21,910
What else could it be?
It can be a.

2109
01:32:21,911 --> 01:32:26,911
You could be looking at it in a 
distorted way because they're saying 

2110
01:32:26,911 --> 01:32:26,920
what it is.

2111
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:31,920
What it is,
is you might be looking at it and some 

2112
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:31,920
sort of a fucked up way to justify your 
position.

2113
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:33,440
I never expected an answer to that 
question.

2114
01:32:33,441 --> 01:32:35,120
That was a rhetorical question.
I appreciate the.

2115
01:32:35,460 --> 01:32:38,260
I'm one of those guys.
I don't let them off float out there.

2116
01:32:38,530 --> 01:32:43,530
If you walk around a rhetorical one,
that needs to be addressed in a very 

2117
01:32:43,530 --> 01:32:48,061
literal sense already.
I was laughing about something last 

2118
01:32:48,250 --> 01:32:51,340
night about you was telling eleanor,
but uh,

2119
01:32:52,240 --> 01:32:53,230
I would,
um,

2120
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:56,940
you know,
he's so good at pool Joe that I,

2121
01:32:56,950 --> 01:33:01,950
you know,
it's really tough to beat and even the 

2122
01:33:01,950 --> 01:33:01,950
nine boy,
what you can,

2123
01:33:01,950 --> 01:33:02,830
can involve a lot of luck.
And uh,

2124
01:33:02,831 --> 01:33:07,450
I would start talking about Carlos just 
10 years ago.

2125
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:10,600
Say I just to aggravate him and it's 
fucking stick with prop,

2126
01:33:10,890 --> 01:33:15,890
you know,
like he would get aggravated just 

2127
01:33:15,890 --> 01:33:16,570
looking for any kind of edge at the 
comedy store.

2128
01:33:16,570 --> 01:33:21,570
The other day I was there,
somebody tore down the car and Cs 

2129
01:33:21,570 --> 01:33:21,570
pitcher and threatened the trash and I 
went out.

2130
01:33:21,570 --> 01:33:21,570
I did it.
I was like,

2131
01:33:21,820 --> 01:33:25,240
fucking asshole is someone trying to 
impress you.

2132
01:33:25,241 --> 01:33:27,040
Probably somebody wants you to be a 
boyfriend.

2133
01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:32,560
Did you do stand up at the comedy store?
I'm only allowed on friends and family.

2134
01:33:32,590 --> 01:33:33,040
You know,
like,

2135
01:33:33,130 --> 01:33:35,020
like if there's a host site now,
they'll let me.

2136
01:33:35,030 --> 01:33:40,030
Do you do the belly room?
No room or no army fight.

2137
01:33:40,370 --> 01:33:42,550
It's like a three to five minutes.
It's a great club.

2138
01:33:43,330 --> 01:33:46,600
What a great old time club.
Dominic,

2139
01:33:47,170 --> 01:33:48,400
what's your favorite club in the 
country?

2140
01:33:50,470 --> 01:33:53,940
Probably that one in Columbus.
As far as a,

2141
01:33:54,070 --> 01:33:55,870
a neutral club,
I mean,

2142
01:33:55,871 --> 01:33:57,360
you know.
Yeah,

2143
01:33:57,500 --> 01:34:01,540
I mean I love the wildwood.
When I do the wall would gig.

2144
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:07,200
Uh,
it's really special to me because I'm 

2145
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:07,210
from philly and while it's like the 
suburb of Philly that,

2146
01:34:07,300 --> 01:34:08,440
you know,
do you do helium?

2147
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:10,150
Yeah.
Great Club.

2148
01:34:10,170 --> 01:34:10,820
Yeah,
that's a,

2149
01:34:10,940 --> 01:34:13,180
that's another all time classic.
I'm doing.

2150
01:34:13,181 --> 01:34:15,160
Do you ever do captain Brian's?
Did I ask you that?

2151
01:34:15,220 --> 01:34:17,800
No ship.
It's in Marco Island.

2152
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:19,590
So it's beautiful.
It's a great gig.

2153
01:34:19,630 --> 01:34:24,630
It looks like a b room,
but they pay like a and a room and it's 

2154
01:34:24,630 --> 01:34:24,630
just fun.
I mean,

2155
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:25,790
being on,
you know,

2156
01:34:26,230 --> 01:34:28,930
that kind of environment that Columbus,
Ohio,

2157
01:34:28,990 --> 01:34:29,800
by the way,
funny button.

2158
01:34:29,810 --> 01:34:32,460
That's my home club.
Started up strips,

2159
01:34:32,470 --> 01:34:34,960
a great guy.
I also like Tampa,

2160
01:34:35,020 --> 01:34:37,060
uh,
and uh,

2161
01:34:37,061 --> 01:34:38,530
the Hollywood improv.
How many years?

2162
01:34:38,750 --> 01:34:40,990
It wasn't a weeks a.
are you on the road a year?

2163
01:34:41,020 --> 01:34:41,710
I don't know,
Joe.

2164
01:34:41,711 --> 01:34:43,840
It's opened up from doing tv or not.
You know,

2165
01:34:44,290 --> 01:34:46,160
like when I was doing that judge show,
uh,

2166
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:49,180
it was less,
I would say at least half the time.

2167
01:34:49,210 --> 01:34:50,720
What was that Judge Show?
It was like,

2168
01:34:50,950 --> 01:34:52,330
it was called Supreme Court,
a comedy.

2169
01:34:52,331 --> 01:34:56,440
It's actually coming back.
It was on direct TV and it was fun,

2170
01:34:56,441 --> 01:34:56,920
you know,
it was,

2171
01:34:57,630 --> 01:34:57,980
I'd love

2172
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:02,980
you to do it because I'm the judge and 
it's real small claims cases and they 

2173
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:10,600
people sign a contract that says they 
can't sue again in a real small claims 

2174
01:35:10,881 --> 01:35:13,820
court that I make the final decision.
And I just told them,

2175
01:35:13,821 --> 01:35:14,460
I says,
you know,

2176
01:35:14,810 --> 01:35:17,240
I don't really know much about the law.
I said,

2177
01:35:17,241 --> 01:35:19,130
I'm not fair.
If it's a hot chick,

2178
01:35:19,131 --> 01:35:21,500
you're going to win something.
And you know,

2179
01:35:21,501 --> 01:35:23,300
that's the way life is.
You know,

2180
01:35:23,301 --> 01:35:25,610
I did some exactly like that long time 
ago.

2181
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:28,710
They tried Merv Griffin tried to do it.
It's called Rogan's law St.

2182
01:35:29,690 --> 01:35:31,580
pilot for it before I ever did fear 
factor.

2183
01:35:31,890 --> 01:35:32,770
Yeah.
Didn't.

2184
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:34,130
They didn't do it though.
They never.

2185
01:35:34,250 --> 01:35:36,140
Would.
You have comedians is the lawyers?

2186
01:35:36,160 --> 01:35:36,840
Yeah.
Yeah.

2187
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:38,330
No,
not as lawyers.

2188
01:35:38,331 --> 01:35:43,331
There's no comedians as a lawyers,
but there's a wish I could remember 

2189
01:35:43,331 --> 01:35:43,970
their names.
She had comics.

2190
01:35:43,970 --> 01:35:45,650
I see him around the Improv.
I'm sorry,

2191
01:35:45,651 --> 01:35:49,820
I'm blanking on his name.
He was the bailiff and there was another

2192
01:35:49,821 --> 01:35:51,380
call.
We had hot chicks is the bail and.

2193
01:35:51,590 --> 01:35:54,680
Oh really?
And that's why your show worked in mind.

2194
01:35:54,681 --> 01:35:56,330
Didn't even go past.
We did three.

2195
01:35:56,331 --> 01:36:01,331
We did three years in Moonee.
Do something like that too when he was 

2196
01:36:01,331 --> 01:36:01,331
on my show a lot.
Yeah.

2197
01:36:01,820 --> 01:36:04,190
And He,
I gotta say he really gave good energy.

2198
01:36:04,670 --> 01:36:06,320
I really did.
He was a pro.

2199
01:36:06,530 --> 01:36:08,930
He really will.
He really went out 100 percent,

2200
01:36:08,931 --> 01:36:10,070
you know,
it was fun.

2201
01:36:10,170 --> 01:36:15,110
Know who was fucking hilarious.
Was a little sandy,

2202
01:36:15,140 --> 01:36:19,310
Andy kindler killers.
He had me crying,

2203
01:36:19,311 --> 01:36:21,680
laughing.
Let's little nebbishy Jewish guy.

2204
01:36:21,681 --> 01:36:24,530
He's walking around with these almost 
like woody Allen look,

2205
01:36:24,531 --> 01:36:29,531
and he was funny and it's interesting to
see because you could tell which 

2206
01:36:29,531 --> 01:36:33,821
comedians have improv chops and which 
guys are only funny behind the racked 

2207
01:36:33,821 --> 01:36:33,930
right way.

2208
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:39,760
Sure.
And I'll tell you who was really 

2209
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:39,760
prepared to the point where it was like 
a lawyer was love.

2210
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:41,160
It's really.
Oh,

2211
01:36:41,270 --> 01:36:43,550
he went up against Kevin Pollak.
Poor Kevin pollock.

2212
01:36:44,270 --> 01:36:47,970
He was doing Adam Arkin impressions at 
Adam.

2213
01:36:47,990 --> 01:36:48,880
Mr Alan,
Alan,

2214
01:36:49,150 --> 01:36:51,110
Alan Arkin.
Yeah.

2215
01:36:51,290 --> 01:36:56,290
I don't know.
And he was doing impressions and these 

2216
01:36:56,290 --> 01:36:56,290
kids.
I said,

2217
01:36:56,290 --> 01:36:56,480
we got like 17 year old kids in here.
They know what you're doing.

2218
01:36:56,980 --> 01:36:57,590
Yeah.
You know,

2219
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:02,600
it's like Joe Piscopo the three stooges.
Now they're going to know them again 

2220
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:02,630
because the movie.
But then I go,

2221
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:07,900
first of all,
you're not even doing like at least do 

2222
01:37:07,900 --> 01:37:08,030
shimp updated from curling.
Now he's doing.

2223
01:37:10,110 --> 01:37:15,110
You understand what our audience is.
So Kevin Pollak does Alan Arkin and love

2224
01:37:15,890 --> 01:37:20,890
was just fucking hilarious.
And he was really prepared and he was 

2225
01:37:20,890 --> 01:37:20,890
going.
Kevin would go to say something.

2226
01:37:20,890 --> 01:37:22,480
They would go silence,
silence.

2227
01:37:22,481 --> 01:37:25,010
You impotent,
get Queer,

2228
01:37:26,330 --> 01:37:27,570
alcoholic,
faggot.

2229
01:37:27,571 --> 01:37:29,230
Trillium's doing all this shit,
you know,

2230
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:31,760
they,
they bleep that out,

2231
01:37:31,761 --> 01:37:36,761
but you know,
just like anything he could think of to 

2232
01:37:36,761 --> 01:37:37,550
grit down.
Yeah.

2233
01:37:38,220 --> 01:37:40,520
It's funny though.
So you're there for three years?

2234
01:37:40,740 --> 01:37:42,800
Yeah.
And it's only on directv.

2235
01:37:42,980 --> 01:37:45,090
It was.
Did it get on the Internet at all?

2236
01:37:45,091 --> 01:37:47,000
Does anybody,
anybody thinks on a website or.

2237
01:37:47,010 --> 01:37:48,730
No?
No,

2238
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:51,320
but we're going to do a podcast.
I told you from the laugh factory.

2239
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:53,570
Who you going to do it with?
Myself?

2240
01:37:53,630 --> 01:37:54,810
Just you?
Yeah.

2241
01:37:54,890 --> 01:37:56,370
Well,
unless anybody

2242
01:37:56,370 --> 01:37:58,140
else has available.
Brian,

2243
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:03,320
you want to be in business with Brian?
Brian actually does a whole string of 

2244
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:06,690
podcasts.
Your podcast studio at the Ice House.

2245
01:38:07,260 --> 01:38:08,420
Did I do it with you?
Yeah.

2246
01:38:08,430 --> 01:38:10,430
You were at that point.
I know your face,

2247
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:11,800
right?
You already explained that.

2248
01:38:11,801 --> 01:38:13,540
That xanax is a motherfucker.
Yeah,

2249
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:15,090
I remember.
Was that he?

2250
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:16,710
Was that today?
Earlier today.

2251
01:38:17,130 --> 01:38:22,130
This morning when we did the podcast.
How many of those you take one half a 

2252
01:38:22,130 --> 01:38:22,130
day.
Is that what you know?

2253
01:38:22,130 --> 01:38:24,570
I'd take a three hips.
Three apps in a day?

2254
01:38:24,670 --> 01:38:26,040
Yeah.
How long have you been doing that?

2255
01:38:27,260 --> 01:38:28,560
I don't know.
Five years.

2256
01:38:28,680 --> 01:38:31,860
Wow.
Ever since you left me,

2257
01:38:31,861 --> 01:38:34,110
you son of a big difference.
I don't know.

2258
01:38:34,111 --> 01:38:37,400
I don't know what it's like not to take 
you to.

2259
01:38:38,370 --> 01:38:39,420
Do you ever say,
you know what,

2260
01:38:39,421 --> 01:38:42,540
tomorrow I'm going to become a Vegan and
start doing yoga and drink spring water.

2261
01:38:42,541 --> 01:38:47,541
Go for morning jogs.
Never wanting to just jump out the 

2262
01:38:47,541 --> 01:38:47,541
window.

2263
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:50,170
No,
I don't.

2264
01:38:50,190 --> 01:38:51,330
I mean,
when you,

2265
01:38:51,331 --> 01:38:53,610
when you get ideas in your head of 
moderation,

2266
01:38:54,150 --> 01:38:55,500
what is the,
you know,

2267
01:38:56,170 --> 01:38:58,350
you just go out of this.
Probably can't be good for me.

2268
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:01,770
Let me just kick back a little.
Stick around a little longer.

2269
01:39:02,070 --> 01:39:03,420
Like what do you,
what are you thinking of when you,

2270
01:39:03,450 --> 01:39:06,000
when you go moderation?
Uh,

2271
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:10,530
I think I only think that way when I'm 
hung over and then when I'm,

2272
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:13,140
when I'm normal,
I feel invincible.

2273
01:39:15,070 --> 01:39:16,800
Normal.
What?

2274
01:39:16,820 --> 01:39:21,820
I'm normal.
I mean I just feel like I could drink 

2275
01:39:21,820 --> 01:39:24,051
and I know a little bit of booze and a 
little bit of Xanax just makes you feel 

2276
01:39:24,051 --> 01:39:24,660
great.
You just feel on top of it.

2277
01:39:24,670 --> 01:39:25,360
Well,
yeah.

2278
01:39:25,380 --> 01:39:27,330
I'm a little bit.
Does a lot of booze.

2279
01:39:27,331 --> 01:39:28,050
I never,
I never,

2280
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:34,280
I was talking to an emergency room 
doctor and she told me that the Xanax 

2281
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:36,750
that I take at the level I take,
it is probably a placebo at this point.

2282
01:39:37,050 --> 01:39:37,710
Really?
Well,

2283
01:39:37,740 --> 01:39:39,210
she said because you know,
you never,

2284
01:39:39,420 --> 01:39:42,750
I never upped the dosage because I'm not
that stupid,

2285
01:39:42,751 --> 01:39:47,751
you know,
and I don't want to get to a point I 

2286
01:39:47,751 --> 01:39:47,751
never got high on Xanax.
Well,

2287
01:39:47,751 --> 01:39:51,381
is that what you're supposed to do?
You're supposed to continue to up the 

2288
01:39:51,381 --> 01:39:51,381
dosage?
No,

2289
01:39:51,381 --> 01:39:54,341
but I think if I were an addict in the 
sense of like being really addicted to 

2290
01:39:54,341 --> 01:39:56,880
the drug and the feeling of it would be 
normal to try and get higher.

2291
01:39:57,390 --> 01:40:02,390
I think it's just a psychological thing 
that I think I needed to go back to 

2292
01:40:02,390 --> 01:40:05,871
sleep and I'll.
Well when you hear about a guy's like 

2293
01:40:05,871 --> 01:40:06,660
rush limbaugh and he starts doing 
autopsies and you know,

2294
01:40:06,661 --> 01:40:09,600
you hear about them doing 99 a day and 
you know,

2295
01:40:09,601 --> 01:40:14,601
you know,
you want to do that xanax every day and 

2296
01:40:14,601 --> 01:40:14,601
have a drink every day.
Do you ever see that and go fuck.

2297
01:40:14,601 --> 01:40:15,900
Like how far away is that for when I'm 
doing.

2298
01:40:16,160 --> 01:40:17,170
No,
you're.

2299
01:40:17,171 --> 01:40:19,290
You're maintaining.
Maintaining.

2300
01:40:19,291 --> 01:40:20,350
Yeah,
very specific.

2301
01:40:20,660 --> 01:40:25,660
Worry more about the booze.
I mean like I'm not into like 

2302
01:40:25,660 --> 01:40:25,660
painkillers.
Right?

2303
01:40:25,660 --> 01:40:26,850
Or do you remember when I had an 
operation on my balls?

2304
01:40:27,420 --> 01:40:28,550
What did you have done?
Your balls?

2305
01:40:28,580 --> 01:40:33,580
I had him.
I'm a plastic surgery to have them 

2306
01:40:33,580 --> 01:40:34,020
reshaped and no,
I had to make them look yummy.

2307
01:40:35,790 --> 01:40:40,790
Dipped in chocolate.
Now I had a called a spermatocele and 

2308
01:40:40,980 --> 01:40:45,360
it's a rupture of the sperm duck.
So your bowl starts getting bigger.

2309
01:40:45,390 --> 01:40:46,200
Oh,
that's right.

2310
01:40:46,201 --> 01:40:47,520
Yeah,
I remember that.

2311
01:40:47,521 --> 01:40:49,260
Yeah.
You were at a lot of fucking pain.

2312
01:40:49,540 --> 01:40:51,420
Yeah.
But the thing that was interesting was I

2313
01:40:51,421 --> 01:40:54,530
never took painkillers because if you 
moved

2314
01:40:54,540 --> 01:40:59,540
it really hurt.
But what I did was I have sophie and I 

2315
01:40:59,540 --> 01:41:02,110
would split wine bottle of wine.
I'd rather get high on alcohol then take

2316
01:41:02,111 --> 01:41:04,380
Vicodin or something.
So libraries.

2317
01:41:04,430 --> 01:41:05,000
I'm not,
you know,

2318
01:41:05,020 --> 01:41:07,540
I'm not really like a drug addict except
for one drug,

2319
01:41:07,990 --> 01:41:12,990
but not like a guy that pops pills and 
fucking drinks like wildly.

2320
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:16,630
I,
I'm very conservative attic.

2321
01:41:16,940 --> 01:41:19,790
But you,
you feel dependent on this experience,

2322
01:41:19,791 --> 01:41:22,250
like having this experience every day 
being in that state?

2323
01:41:23,010 --> 01:41:24,210
Yeah.
Wow.

2324
01:41:25,010 --> 01:41:27,560
But I don't feel bad about it.
Yeah.

2325
01:41:27,561 --> 01:41:32,561
I mean,
I don't feel the need to correct you or 

2326
01:41:32,561 --> 01:41:34,250
give you any advice.
You seem like a pretty resigned to it.

2327
01:41:34,280 --> 01:41:36,780
I'm too scared to.
You're scared of his,

2328
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:40,570
his,
his Wisconsin complicated.

2329
01:41:40,590 --> 01:41:43,920
With your comedy comedy in your way.
I didn't get.

2330
01:41:43,930 --> 01:41:47,250
I don't want to say my rapier wit 
turning on him.

2331
01:41:47,790 --> 01:41:49,510
You to go after you too hard.

2332
01:41:49,540 --> 01:41:49,860
No,
no,

2333
01:41:49,970 --> 01:41:51,550
Nah.
He needed just a beautiful.

2334
01:41:52,630 --> 01:41:56,570
You did what you needed to do 
considering the circumstances,

2335
01:41:56,810 --> 01:42:01,810
how he was behaving.
He goes over the top for this show and a

2336
01:42:02,241 --> 01:42:05,120
lot of people don't understand that.
It's like half of it's fun.

2337
01:42:05,121 --> 01:42:08,630
It's to play a fucking head wound 
victim.

2338
01:42:09,640 --> 01:42:12,060
Like him being silly.
He's like,

2339
01:42:12,140 --> 01:42:14,750
plays a character.
I'm playing a character.

2340
01:42:14,751 --> 01:42:16,880
I'm just,
I don't filter myself.

2341
01:42:16,910 --> 01:42:18,060
Oh,
you got to disagree with Joe.

2342
01:42:19,260 --> 01:42:21,170
What do you get a kick out of this 
screen with the boss?

2343
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:23,590
He's not quite like that.
When the camera's off.

2344
01:42:23,940 --> 01:42:28,940
I felt that myself.
Act Polite and sometimes he goes a 

2345
01:42:28,940 --> 01:42:28,940
little over the top.
I'll just try trying.

2346
01:42:28,940 --> 01:42:33,700
It's all coming from a good place.
He's trying to get better at when to go 

2347
01:42:33,700 --> 01:42:34,340
over the top,
but not to go over the top,

2348
01:42:34,750 --> 01:42:36,200
you know,
houses stand up.

2349
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:38,330
That was really good.

2350
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:39,950
So bad.
He's got some good jokes.

2351
01:42:40,490 --> 01:42:41,510
He's got some good jokes.
He's.

2352
01:42:41,570 --> 01:42:43,640
If he wanted to and he dedicated himself
to it,

2353
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:46,790
he can be a real professional problem as
he's a lazy bitch.

2354
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:48,020
She went here.
My Bob Hope joke.

2355
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:51,780
No,
it's actually not a bad job at.

2356
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:54,230
Did you hear Bob Hope died today.
Oh really?

2357
01:42:54,231 --> 01:42:55,330
Yeah.
They uh.

2358
01:42:55,820 --> 01:42:58,850
Do you think they flew out his body to 
Iraq to entertain all the dead trips?

2359
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:05,200
I'm not sure that a wizard job.
That's the old joe that's six years ago 

2360
01:43:05,551 --> 01:43:06,750
and at Columbus,
Ohio funny.

2361
01:43:06,751 --> 01:43:11,751
But when I got booed in Harrison,
quit quit comedy for five years because 

2362
01:43:11,751 --> 01:43:13,270
what a relief.
Damn it,

2363
01:43:13,940 --> 01:43:15,810
you know,
it's really hard to find them is.

2364
01:43:15,880 --> 01:43:18,820
And this is not to depress you.
Thirty seven.

2365
01:43:19,570 --> 01:43:23,380
No matter what you do,
no matter how much you work,

2366
01:43:23,830 --> 01:43:26,050
you'll never be as good as it was joe or
myself,

2367
01:43:26,900 --> 01:43:27,880
and that's sad in a way.

2368
01:43:27,980 --> 01:43:32,980
Well,
you could put your whole heart and so 

2369
01:43:32,980 --> 01:43:33,850
you could get writers and you'll just 
never have that natural gift.

2370
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:38,170
It's not sad because I don't want that.
I don't know.

2371
01:43:38,410 --> 01:43:39,390
You don't have a choice?
No,

2372
01:43:39,391 --> 01:43:39,990
no.
I mean I,

2373
01:43:39,991 --> 01:43:44,991
I do comedy for a different reason.
I did call me because I think it's fun 

2374
01:43:44,991 --> 01:43:44,991
once in a while,
but I don't obsess about it.

2375
01:43:44,991 --> 01:43:46,150
Like I do it once a week.
I'm good.

2376
01:43:46,650 --> 01:43:48,370
I don't,
it's just kind of.

2377
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:51,620
Because I do so much podcasting,
I consider this like a different kind of

2378
01:43:51,621 --> 01:43:55,010
comedy where instead of doing like 15 
people at a comedy club,

2379
01:43:55,011 --> 01:43:57,860
I'm doing 500,000
people,

2380
01:43:57,861 --> 01:43:58,410
you know,
on,

2381
01:43:58,430 --> 01:44:00,960
on podcast.
It is a kind of form of comedy.

2382
01:44:00,961 --> 01:44:02,570
You know,
I've heard people say that about posting

2383
01:44:02,571 --> 01:44:04,670
on message boards,
like Internet Comedians,

2384
01:44:04,910 --> 01:44:07,670
just like text base Internet comedians.
It is,

2385
01:44:07,730 --> 01:44:08,570
there's,
there's,

2386
01:44:08,571 --> 01:44:13,571
you know,
I'm using this template that hides in 

2387
01:44:13,571 --> 01:44:13,571
the corner underneath the hat.

2388
01:44:13,571 --> 01:44:14,440
So when bidding on stage to me it 
doesn't do anything for,

2389
01:44:14,460 --> 01:44:19,460
I don't get a boner about it like,
but I do like to be funny and silly and 

2390
01:44:19,460 --> 01:44:23,090
Tom's old school,
he doesn't silly men in their late 

2391
01:44:23,090 --> 01:44:26,050
thirties,
so like come up with this combined with 

2392
01:44:26,050 --> 01:44:26,050
old school.
But he is,

2393
01:44:26,050 --> 01:44:26,690
he's funny.
He can be funny if you're funny.

2394
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:28,070
He's just a,
he's,

2395
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:31,850
he his got the man boy market covered.
Sweet.

2396
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:32,480
You know,
it's,

2397
01:44:32,481 --> 01:44:33,530
it's a,
it's a market.

2398
01:44:33,531 --> 01:44:36,500
It's out there.
Bill burr attacked it recently.

2399
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,310
He was really upset about it and I,
and,

2400
01:44:39,320 --> 01:44:44,320
and,
and I totally understand what he's 

2401
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:46,001
saying,
but I don't get what alternative comedy 

2402
01:44:46,001 --> 01:44:46,400
is to me because if you go to like the 
biggest alternative website,

2403
01:44:46,430 --> 01:44:51,430
a special thing.com.
They were talking about like Patton 

2404
01:44:51,430 --> 01:44:51,430
Oswald's,
Sarah Silverman,

2405
01:44:51,430 --> 01:44:56,080
Patton Oswald.
Oswald is one of the best joke writers 

2406
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:58,751
that I know,
like that guy is fucking how lame live 

2407
01:44:58,751 --> 01:45:00,560
comedy is simply a way of saying comedy 
for us.

2408
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:05,560
So to the people who couldn't get on 
with the regular place and the people 

2409
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:05,560
they could,
that they worshiped like Patton Oswald,

2410
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:08,490
who's great comedians.
It's like,

2411
01:45:08,570 --> 01:45:10,190
it's just comedy man.
You know,

2412
01:45:10,191 --> 01:45:15,191
the idea is that what Bursa that was so 
hilarious was that they took the fear 

2413
01:45:15,191 --> 01:45:19,931
out of comedy and they made it so 
everyone's ultra supportive and he go 

2414
01:45:19,931 --> 01:45:20,380
there and you can be like really 
awkward.

2415
01:45:20,670 --> 01:45:25,670
And then he goes.
Meanwhile we had to go through fucking 

2416
01:45:25,670 --> 01:45:25,670
bars.
You know,

2417
01:45:25,970 --> 01:45:30,970
the places that we did stand up,
we were starting out and booed at and 

2418
01:45:30,970 --> 01:45:31,020
screened by drunks.
Yeah.

2419
01:45:31,021 --> 01:45:32,870
But do you believe if you're either 
funny or you're not?

2420
01:45:33,170 --> 01:45:34,460
Yeah.
So I believe that.

2421
01:45:34,461 --> 01:45:35,690
Yeah.
I used to believe that,

2422
01:45:35,691 --> 01:45:40,040
but then I see people that were fucking 
terrible and they stuck with it and they

2423
01:45:40,041 --> 01:45:41,920
figured it out.
But they learn.

2424
01:45:41,930 --> 01:45:45,080
You can get,
you can get to a certain point on,

2425
01:45:45,190 --> 01:45:50,190
on hard work,
but there's a certain point you can't 

2426
01:45:50,190 --> 01:45:50,510
get to without talent.
Yes.

2427
01:45:50,540 --> 01:45:51,680
Maybe.
I don't know.

2428
01:45:52,430 --> 01:45:54,530
I would say yes,
but I got dammit.

2429
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:59,560
I've seen people that I thought just 
absolutely sucked and they figured out 

2430
01:45:59,560 --> 01:45:59,560
how to be funny.
There were a bad.

2431
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:01,190
Who's good?
Who's the best on town?

2432
01:46:01,191 --> 01:46:02,510
The comedian you've ever seen?

2433
01:46:06,940 --> 01:46:10,850
I have one.
I don't want to say I don't want to hurt

2434
01:46:10,851 --> 01:46:13,310
anybody's feelings.
I tell you whose name me.

2435
01:46:13,340 --> 01:46:18,340
Your three top comedians have excluded 
that you see working right now working 

2436
01:46:20,181 --> 01:46:22,370
today.
Doug.

2437
01:46:22,380 --> 01:46:27,380
Stan helps my favorite after that,
doug standpoint.

2438
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:32,290
The only thing about doug is he like 
angry about something.

2439
01:46:33,680 --> 01:46:34,720
Can't tell.
Getting.

2440
01:46:35,090 --> 01:46:35,770
Yeah,
of course.

2441
01:46:35,771 --> 01:46:36,670
I'm kidding.
How dare you.

2442
01:46:37,970 --> 01:46:40,670
Who else?
Louis?

2443
01:46:40,671 --> 01:46:43,940
Just sheer,
sheer prolific amount of amazing.

2444
01:46:44,520 --> 01:46:46,930
Just puts out a new hour every year.
Whose stuff's great.

2445
01:46:46,970 --> 01:46:51,970
I definitely have people that I like to 
see that don't really necessarily stand 

2446
01:46:51,970 --> 01:46:51,970
up

2447
01:46:51,970 --> 01:46:55,070
though.
Maybe alternative like Don Barris if 

2448
01:46:55,070 --> 01:46:57,580
there's only three people that I watched
at the comedy story is funny and 

2449
01:46:57,580 --> 01:46:57,600
everyone else I really don't watch.
It's Don Barris,

2450
01:46:57,660 --> 01:46:59,610
brody Stevens,
Taylor,

2451
01:46:59,630 --> 01:47:03,690
and do a headline set in Austin last 
year when I was there for a UFC.

2452
01:47:03,691 --> 01:47:06,090
I didn't book a Gig.
I went to see him at the,

2453
01:47:06,091 --> 01:47:08,010
uh,
what is the cap city?

2454
01:47:08,410 --> 01:47:11,430
Just fucking great man.
He was really funny.

2455
01:47:11,460 --> 01:47:16,460
Norton killed any.
It was so dirty that sometimes I feel 

2456
01:47:16,460 --> 01:47:19,440
like I have too many Dick Jokes and my 
act like what is wrong with me forever.

2457
01:47:19,650 --> 01:47:24,650
And then I saw norton.
It was an hour solid of non peak hour 

2458
01:47:24,650 --> 01:47:29,351
solid of his cock,
one in someone's mouth and then I 

2459
01:47:29,351 --> 01:47:29,790
laughed.
Naturally.

2460
01:47:29,791 --> 01:47:31,580
Fun the entire time.
Yeah,

2461
01:47:31,830 --> 01:47:33,060
he's,
he's great.

2462
01:47:33,590 --> 01:47:35,670
Um,
depaul is great.

2463
01:47:36,430 --> 01:47:38,460
There's a lot of great comedians out 
there right now.

2464
01:47:38,461 --> 01:47:41,430
Man.
This is a great time for Kelly.

2465
01:47:42,250 --> 01:47:44,660
Robert Bird,
Taj,

2466
01:47:45,870 --> 01:47:50,870
Taj and natural.
Amber has really prolific to constantly 

2467
01:47:50,870 --> 01:47:51,960
come up and new shit.
Yeah,

2468
01:47:51,961 --> 01:47:53,270
there's a lot of great guys.
No,

2469
01:47:53,450 --> 01:47:58,450
it's a great time for comedy.
Comedy comes in waves because it was 

2470
01:47:58,450 --> 01:48:00,270
such a dearth of talent at the store for
a long time.

2471
01:48:01,250 --> 01:48:03,770
And you're,
your group started up and.

2472
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:09,080
Yeah,
when we came there in the nineties it 

2473
01:48:09,080 --> 01:48:11,170
was.
You'd have these guys come up and they 

2474
01:48:11,170 --> 01:48:14,241
were terrible.
There were people that were singing 

2475
01:48:14,241 --> 01:48:14,241
songs and they wouldn't even have a joke
in it.

2476
01:48:14,250 --> 01:48:16,640
It would just be like a really,
like,

2477
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:22,200
like a fucking famous hit song and they 
would just sing it and yeah.

2478
01:48:23,160 --> 01:48:24,450
Oh,
you remember fucking what's his name?

2479
01:48:24,451 --> 01:48:29,451
Barry diamond.
He used to walk in and what does it 

2480
01:48:29,451 --> 01:48:29,451
welcome in Memphis?
Memphis.

2481
01:48:29,451 --> 01:48:33,651
He would go on stage singing and really 
singing it and then everybody will be 

2482
01:48:33,651 --> 01:48:33,651
waiting for it to be a joke.

2483
01:48:33,651 --> 01:48:37,790
I told you he threatened to kill me 
because he said I was stealing Zach 

2484
01:48:37,790 --> 01:48:39,150
because some bartender in San Francisco 
so that I was doing the deck.

2485
01:48:39,820 --> 01:48:42,120
I brought them in one night to see me.
I said,

2486
01:48:42,150 --> 01:48:44,130
did you see anything?
He goes,

2487
01:48:44,131 --> 01:48:45,500
no,
he.

2488
01:48:45,570 --> 01:48:49,560
Because he had asked me to help him out 
or he bet he bad mouth me to the guys in

2489
01:48:49,561 --> 01:48:50,690
Atlanta.
Right.

2490
01:48:50,700 --> 01:48:53,400
And I got no beef with Barry.
And he said,

2491
01:48:53,401 --> 01:48:54,570
well,
if dom American headline,

2492
01:48:54,571 --> 01:48:56,610
why can I.
and these guys are friends of mine,

2493
01:48:56,640 --> 01:48:58,290
so they call them up.
Who is this fucking guy?

2494
01:48:58,920 --> 01:49:01,500
I said,
why would you badmouth me when you don't

2495
01:49:01,501 --> 01:49:02,970
know who's,
who's friends with who?

2496
01:49:03,660 --> 01:49:04,500
He said,
well,

2497
01:49:04,530 --> 01:49:06,750
I'm sorry.
Can you try and get me the GIG now?

2498
01:49:06,810 --> 01:49:07,440
I go,
no,

2499
01:49:07,620 --> 01:49:08,820
I'm not going to help you.
Now.

2500
01:49:09,130 --> 01:49:14,130
Community is just so scrolling.
I saw barry diamond the other day and I 

2501
01:49:14,130 --> 01:49:15,810
actually talked to him.
We're going to do standup comedy store.

2502
01:49:15,930 --> 01:49:19,950
I wasn't very good.
I saw a girl,

2503
01:49:20,020 --> 01:49:20,960
girl,
chick,

2504
01:49:21,030 --> 01:49:22,950
woman,
to try to touch you or anything.

2505
01:49:23,320 --> 01:49:27,870
Just me on the lips.
We saw girl with Mary Lynn Rice Crop.

2506
01:49:27,940 --> 01:49:28,920
Yeah.
She was funny.

2507
01:49:28,980 --> 01:49:33,980
That's Duncan's old girlfriend.
She kicked him out and he had to live 

2508
01:49:33,980 --> 01:49:34,020
with me.
He lived.

2509
01:49:34,670 --> 01:49:36,480
He lived.
He lived here months.

2510
01:49:36,500 --> 01:49:38,390
Yeah.
Lucky bastard.

2511
01:49:38,500 --> 01:49:42,030
The nicest place he ever had his puppet 
stay outside.

2512
01:49:42,090 --> 01:49:43,440
No,
I kept a puppet in my room.

2513
01:49:43,441 --> 01:49:44,820
I said,
I keep the puppet.

2514
01:49:44,860 --> 01:49:48,220
That's part of the deal.
I went Dunkin's doing great.

2515
01:49:48,290 --> 01:49:50,380
He's fucking killing a man.
We went on the road.

2516
01:49:50,381 --> 01:49:52,420
We did Louisville together.
He got a standing ovation.

2517
01:49:52,421 --> 01:49:54,430
Every time we went on stage.
It's crazy.

2518
01:49:54,620 --> 01:49:56,140
It's because of this podcast.
Oh,

2519
01:49:56,141 --> 01:49:57,040
that's great.
Yeah.

2520
01:49:57,041 --> 01:50:00,970
If you do great on the podcast,
it's fucking awesome for you.

2521
01:50:01,150 --> 01:50:03,010
Unfortunately,
because of this episode,

2522
01:50:03,011 --> 01:50:06,140
your twitter numbers are probably going 
to drop really well.

2523
01:50:06,220 --> 01:50:09,250
People are going to unfollow you and I 
shouldn't have gone into the xanax thing

2524
01:50:09,670 --> 01:50:11,940
if we're going to feel bad for me.
No,

2525
01:50:11,980 --> 01:50:14,680
you're being honest.
I think the way you're explaining it and

2526
01:50:14,681 --> 01:50:19,681
describing it as you are,
you're pretty logical about it.

2527
01:50:21,970 --> 01:50:24,640
I can't imagine not doing it.
I'm in love with it.

2528
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:26,680
Without it.
What was the feeling?

2529
01:50:26,681 --> 01:50:28,240
What is,
when you describe anxiety,

2530
01:50:28,241 --> 01:50:29,030
how would you,
uh,

2531
01:50:29,530 --> 01:50:32,480
how would you categorize it?
Like tap,

2532
01:50:32,930 --> 01:50:34,750
like emotional tap,
dance,

2533
01:50:35,260 --> 01:50:39,130
just like jittery and always.
Well,

2534
01:50:39,131 --> 01:50:40,620
I don't,
I never wait man.

2535
01:50:40,630 --> 01:50:43,240
I never waited for the moment because 
I'd always take the pills.

2536
01:50:44,020 --> 01:50:49,020
So when did they find on stage please 
don't not come because of this stage.

2537
01:50:51,610 --> 01:50:54,700
You're super calm and smooth and that's 
where I feel at home.

2538
01:50:55,060 --> 01:50:55,750
Oh,
that's crazy.

2539
01:50:55,820 --> 01:50:58,990
I don't feel wow.
Imagine that for most people,

2540
01:50:59,020 --> 01:51:01,840
getting onstage and public speaking is 
one of the most terrifying things.

2541
01:51:01,930 --> 01:51:02,650
Joe.
Honestly,

2542
01:51:02,651 --> 01:51:05,860
I think my,
my pulse goes down when I'm on stage.

2543
01:51:06,190 --> 01:51:11,190
The only time in the last 15 years I was
ever like a little bit anxious was 

2544
01:51:12,731 --> 01:51:17,731
Madison Square Garden would share 
because I was worried about the sound 

2545
01:51:17,731 --> 01:51:21,901
system and the people in the back nine 
here in me because I heard it was a 

2546
01:51:21,901 --> 01:51:25,051
little screwy and my sister got a little
panicky about what about me on truth,

2547
01:51:25,331 --> 01:51:30,331
I can't believe you get to go up in 
front of all these people and that kind 

2548
01:51:30,331 --> 01:51:32,391
of got into my head and I didn't want to
look up at the banners and stuff of the 

2549
01:51:32,391 --> 01:51:36,360
Knicks and rangers and the history and 
the garden and thinking Ali Frazier.

2550
01:51:36,760 --> 01:51:39,220
Sinatra was there and the Beatles were 
there,

2551
01:51:39,221 --> 01:51:40,570
whatever,
and there's a lock up.

2552
01:51:41,100 --> 01:51:46,100
I was fine,
but I mean I did have a glass of wine 

2553
01:51:46,100 --> 01:51:48,960
and I didn't.
I wanted to set to be over the first 

2554
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:48,960
one.
We did it two nights a second.

2555
01:51:49,210 --> 01:51:54,210
It's so funny how relative,
but it's because the next night if the 

2556
01:51:54,210 --> 01:51:55,780
second set,
we were at the Pepsi Center in Denver,

2557
01:51:55,810 --> 01:51:57,940
which is bigger than the garden and I 
thought,

2558
01:51:57,990 --> 01:51:59,440
oh,
it's good to be out of there.

2559
01:51:59,470 --> 01:52:01,990
I'm so relaxed.
I'm so relieved.

2560
01:52:02,610 --> 01:52:04,300
Just the history of the garden fucked 
with you.

2561
01:52:04,330 --> 01:52:05,050
Well,
that's what it did.

2562
01:52:05,051 --> 01:52:07,090
Yeah.
I started letting it creep into my head.

2563
01:52:07,270 --> 01:52:09,000
You are,
you opened for Whitney Houston to.

2564
01:52:09,790 --> 01:52:12,220
Yeah.
That was not fun.

2565
01:52:12,550 --> 01:52:13,630
It wasn't fun.
Now,

2566
01:52:13,680 --> 01:52:15,580
wouldn't he know?
She never talked to me.

2567
01:52:15,581 --> 01:52:19,750
She had bouncers around her and I say a 
prayer and I thought,

2568
01:52:19,751 --> 01:52:24,751
Geez,
I don't know if Jesus had 300 pound 

2569
01:52:24,751 --> 01:52:24,751
bouncers.

2570
01:52:24,751 --> 01:52:25,300
Think their mostly like fisherman who 
were kind of thin wafer.

2571
01:52:26,170 --> 01:52:28,420
And her father was a great guy and he 
says,

2572
01:52:28,421 --> 01:52:30,670
you know,
I'm lucky to work on my daughter again.

2573
01:52:30,671 --> 01:52:31,980
This is really going well.
I says,

2574
01:52:31,990 --> 01:52:36,990
well thank you.
I'm thinking there's no way I'm working 

2575
01:52:36,990 --> 01:52:39,301
with her again.
And she would come in late her and she 

2576
01:52:39,301 --> 01:52:40,120
was with Bobby Brown already.
They come in one night.

2577
01:52:40,121 --> 01:52:44,410
I'm on stage for 45 minutes at the sands
killing and uh,

2578
01:52:45,170 --> 01:52:46,550
and I told the audience and says,
look,

2579
01:52:46,551 --> 01:52:48,320
I gotta tell you something.
She's not here.

2580
01:52:48,710 --> 01:52:51,200
I don't want you to think because you're
a good cook because I'm from Philly.

2581
01:52:51,201 --> 01:52:52,770
And it was like Lennox city.
And you know,

2582
01:52:52,910 --> 01:52:55,550
a lot of them knew me already and I 
said,

2583
01:52:55,580 --> 01:52:57,860
she's not here,
I don't want to leave you in the dark.

2584
01:52:58,340 --> 01:53:00,750
That's why I'm staying on stage.
I'm not being self indulgent.

2585
01:53:00,760 --> 01:53:02,020
And they start cheering.
No,

2586
01:53:02,330 --> 01:53:04,610
I was really doing it for them.
That's hilarious.

2587
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:06,380
Yeah.
And then she finally came.

2588
01:53:06,410 --> 01:53:08,420
But how long did he,
how long did you stay on stage?

2589
01:53:08,450 --> 01:53:12,130
40 slash 40 slash 50 minutes on crowd 
work.

2590
01:53:12,140 --> 01:53:13,250
No,
I didn't do any.

2591
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:14,750
Well,
was lucky that was philly though.

2592
01:53:15,250 --> 01:53:17,000
A place where you could do that?
It's Philly.

2593
01:53:17,060 --> 01:53:22,060
Well,
I mean the thing is you have to tell 

2594
01:53:22,060 --> 01:53:22,060
them if they were upset,
you know,

2595
01:53:22,060 --> 01:53:22,430
I would have gotten off.
I mean,

2596
01:53:22,670 --> 01:53:24,610
the only time I had trouble,
uh,

2597
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:27,440
with a big crowd was in Dayton,
Ohio,

2598
01:53:28,490 --> 01:53:30,710
because they do,
they really fucking hated me.

2599
01:53:30,711 --> 01:53:32,780
They hated me so much.
They came to Cleveland,

2600
01:53:32,781 --> 01:53:34,010
the Boomi,
he's serious,

2601
01:53:34,430 --> 01:53:36,440
but they couldn't get.
I see he's still here,

2602
01:53:36,441 --> 01:53:39,060
but you still can't get good seats that 
were in the backbone.

2603
01:53:39,200 --> 01:53:44,200
Me,
they hated you so bad that came to 

2604
01:53:44,200 --> 01:53:44,200
place.

2605
01:53:44,200 --> 01:53:44,200
Here's what happened.
Well,

2606
01:53:44,200 --> 01:53:46,710
I mean they're probably coming it 
probably show fans coming to see her and

2607
01:53:46,720 --> 01:53:51,720
then generally her crowd was so eclectic
that it was easy to do stand up for it 

2608
01:53:51,720 --> 01:53:53,060
because she doesn't get like a rock and 
roll crowd.

2609
01:53:53,061 --> 01:53:55,640
It's not like quiet riot or something.
It's like,

2610
01:53:55,870 --> 01:54:00,870
you know,
she got people that push you want 

2611
01:54:00,870 --> 01:54:02,980
academy award.
You got grandmothers with their 

2612
01:54:02,980 --> 01:54:02,980
granddaughters and transvestites.
Yeah.

2613
01:54:02,980 --> 01:54:05,840
People forget she won an academy award.
She's also an emmy award.

2614
01:54:06,620 --> 01:54:08,570
Bad Ass straight career.
Yeah.

2615
01:54:08,990 --> 01:54:13,990
But uh,
so I'm up on stage and this girl starts 

2616
01:54:13,990 --> 01:54:14,470
screaming and the crowd was really good.
Just go skirts,

2617
01:54:14,630 --> 01:54:15,320
store,
screaming,

2618
01:54:15,330 --> 01:54:16,820
share,
share.

2619
01:54:17,210 --> 01:54:17,900
I go,
you know,

2620
01:54:18,170 --> 01:54:22,370
she'll be out in a little while.
And then finally I lost my patient.

2621
01:54:22,371 --> 01:54:23,720
I go,
I said,

2622
01:54:23,721 --> 01:54:25,070
first of all,
she's not even here yet.

2623
01:54:25,130 --> 01:54:27,380
She changed it and put her first eyelash
one.

2624
01:54:27,830 --> 01:54:29,270
She's,
there's a break.

2625
01:54:29,271 --> 01:54:29,810
I said,
what do you,

2626
01:54:29,811 --> 01:54:33,470
who do you think?
I am like the friend of the owner of the

2627
01:54:33,471 --> 01:54:34,160
building.
I said,

2628
01:54:34,161 --> 01:54:36,260
I'm a comedian.
I got to do share.

2629
01:54:36,261 --> 01:54:36,890
I go,
listen,

2630
01:54:36,891 --> 01:54:39,490
you stupid son of a bitch.
You think I'm gonna?

2631
01:54:39,790 --> 01:54:43,250
I'm gonna lift up the curtain shoe to 
come out and sing for you fucking idiot.

2632
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:48,520
And then the crowds and then I went 
after her and I just started at one 

2633
01:54:48,520 --> 01:54:50,450
after another and then the crowd start 
booing.

2634
01:54:50,920 --> 01:54:52,820
Well I got upset with me and I go,
Hey,

2635
01:54:52,850 --> 01:54:54,920
I'm sorry,
but she's fucking annoying,

2636
01:54:55,480 --> 01:55:00,480
you know,
and that was my only really bad 

2637
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:00,860
experience and it's pretty tough when 
you lose an arena.

2638
01:55:01,680 --> 01:55:04,550
It ain't like we lose in 300 people at a
comedy club and getting them back.

2639
01:55:04,551 --> 01:55:07,030
When you lose an arena,
like to let the.

2640
01:55:07,640 --> 01:55:10,400
Well it's a real problem when no one 
wants to see you,

2641
01:55:10,520 --> 01:55:11,680
then they're there to see some.

2642
01:55:11,750 --> 01:55:13,370
Let's see.
She put me on the bill,

2643
01:55:13,730 --> 01:55:16,070
which really made it classy.
Wasn't like,

2644
01:55:16,071 --> 01:55:17,830
you know,
special guests or anything.

2645
01:55:17,831 --> 01:55:22,831
It was like dom opening act.
That's what happened to Kurt Fox 

2646
01:55:22,831 --> 01:55:24,510
recently with Charlie Sheen.
Remember that?

2647
01:55:25,390 --> 01:55:27,710
Watch the video.
They gave him a chance.

2648
01:55:27,711 --> 01:55:29,990
He a dick up there.
They gave him a chance.

2649
01:55:30,380 --> 01:55:31,640
No,
I disagree.

2650
01:55:31,641 --> 01:55:32,830
I watched it.
They weren't yet.

2651
01:55:32,870 --> 01:55:34,640
No,
I'm saying that they weren't really dare

2652
01:55:34,641 --> 01:55:35,780
to see him.
They were,

2653
01:55:35,810 --> 01:55:37,580
they were down,
they gave him a chance,

2654
01:55:37,581 --> 01:55:40,520
they gave him a chance and he didn't 
come with any jokes that that's not,

2655
01:55:40,530 --> 01:55:42,020
that's not what happened in that 
situation.

2656
01:55:42,230 --> 01:55:44,050
I think curt will admit to that he

2657
01:55:44,050 --> 01:55:46,320
just didn't work well when we had him on
the podcast.

2658
01:55:46,321 --> 01:55:49,100
A I sort of an ironic sense of humor and
he's a.

2659
01:55:49,170 --> 01:55:51,710
he's got a good delivery,
but I think he requires a,

2660
01:55:51,711 --> 01:55:52,840
an attentive audience.
Yeah,

2661
01:55:52,860 --> 01:55:57,860
but he also said on the podcast we had a
death squad that that when he came out 

2662
01:55:57,860 --> 01:56:01,221
that the people didn't know what to 
expect and so he came out and just 

2663
01:56:01,531 --> 01:56:03,600
started doing comedy and people 
immediately when you came out,

2664
01:56:03,620 --> 01:56:05,690
start going,
who books with Ms Dot troubleshooting.

2665
01:56:06,210 --> 01:56:07,530
That's a big difference.
Yeah.

2666
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:10,760
Well that's him being a rookie in these.
Yeah.

2667
01:56:12,180 --> 01:56:13,850
Sheena.
Some dudes just sitting there talking.

2668
01:56:13,890 --> 01:56:16,770
That's what you were saying.
That's him being a rookie.

2669
01:56:16,771 --> 01:56:21,771
You have to address that.
You're hired as a comedian to go on 

2670
01:56:21,771 --> 01:56:22,480
stage in front of Charlie Sheen and no 
one knows what the fuck is going on.

2671
01:56:22,481 --> 01:56:25,140
This is the first show you guys have 
done and that's what happened.

2672
01:56:25,290 --> 01:56:27,990
You got to go onstage and you go,
you got to set them up.

2673
01:56:27,991 --> 01:56:29,570
I don't know what the Fuck Charles is 
going to do it.

2674
01:56:29,590 --> 01:56:34,590
I think there was one.
I like Tennessee want to handle that or 

2675
01:56:34,590 --> 01:56:34,590
something like that,
but it's really at this stage

2676
01:56:34,590 --> 01:56:35,230
who's here to say Charlie Sheen?

2677
01:56:36,090 --> 01:56:41,090
Yeah,
I mean it's really bad if you're not on 

2678
01:56:41,090 --> 01:56:41,090
the bill.
Yeah,

2679
01:56:41,090 --> 01:56:41,520
it's very classy and we share was 
classy.

2680
01:56:41,530 --> 01:56:46,530
You know stacy,
the dame had Claire C and I think there 

2681
01:56:46,530 --> 01:56:47,520
was something else that like they were 
waiting.

2682
01:56:47,550 --> 01:56:52,550
They were waiting for a long time and I 
was really late and I'm sure,

2683
01:56:53,881 --> 01:56:55,680
I'm sure there's a lot of that,
but you know,

2684
01:56:55,681 --> 01:57:00,681
you've got to learn how to use.
If you're going to open for a guy like 

2685
01:57:00,681 --> 01:57:02,100
that,
you have to have some fucking rock solid

2686
01:57:02,101 --> 01:57:07,101
material.
Or what did he think was going to 

2687
01:57:07,101 --> 01:57:07,101
happen?
Joe,

2688
01:57:07,101 --> 01:57:09,980
what did you think was gonna happen when
I was going to write an act that 

2689
01:57:09,980 --> 01:57:09,980
quickly?
Well,

2690
01:57:09,980 --> 01:57:10,170
that's what he wants to it.
What do you want to do?

2691
01:57:10,171 --> 01:57:15,171
And his brain comedians with them,
I know Russell Peters did a couple of 

2692
01:57:15,171 --> 01:57:15,171
them.
We did Toronto with them and a few other

2693
01:57:15,171 --> 01:57:15,720
places I think as well.

2694
01:57:15,930 --> 01:57:20,930
And they would go up on stage and 
Russell would sit down with them and 

2695
01:57:20,930 --> 01:57:21,150
Charlie would interview.
Yeah,

2696
01:57:21,220 --> 01:57:22,710
Russell would interview Charlie.
Oh,

2697
01:57:22,820 --> 01:57:26,070
talk to them and then crack a bunch of 
jokes along the way and you know,

2698
01:57:26,071 --> 01:57:28,050
Russell's great at that shit.
So Russell,

2699
01:57:28,090 --> 01:57:30,060
so fucking funny.
He's a great guy,

2700
01:57:30,160 --> 01:57:31,530
great guy.
And he's a,

2701
01:57:31,700 --> 01:57:32,400
you know,
it's so funny.

2702
01:57:32,401 --> 01:57:34,590
Every time I sit next to an Asian 
person,

2703
01:57:35,070 --> 01:57:38,880
I mean I'm talking about Asia from 
Cambodia to Pakistan.

2704
01:57:39,720 --> 01:57:41,370
I always asked him to in a Russell 
Peters,

2705
01:57:41,950 --> 01:57:46,950
if we're forgetting to talk,
if they asked me what I do and they all 

2706
01:57:46,950 --> 01:57:46,950
know,
wow,

2707
01:57:46,950 --> 01:57:51,310
talk about one continent to pick the.
Get to watch your back Asia to.

2708
01:57:51,330 --> 01:57:56,330
He sold out the o two arena,
I think it was two nights in a row in 

2709
01:57:56,330 --> 01:57:56,400
London.
That's what they did.

2710
01:57:56,450 --> 01:57:59,240
The UFC do the UFC there,
Russell.

2711
01:57:59,830 --> 01:58:04,350
That the coolest thing about him is that
he constantly surprises me.

2712
01:58:04,351 --> 01:58:05,130
Like he,
he,

2713
01:58:05,131 --> 01:58:10,131
there's this guy named polly,
he's like this big twitter guy and he 

2714
01:58:10,131 --> 01:58:10,131
just gave them a chance like,
hey,

2715
01:58:10,131 --> 01:58:13,740
why don't you come out to Arizona?
And then he did the same thing to a door

2716
01:58:13,741 --> 01:58:17,540
guy who Jesus over at the comedy store 
just grabbed them,

2717
01:58:17,560 --> 01:58:18,000
was like,
hey,

2718
01:58:18,001 --> 01:58:20,220
he was one of the guys that I came to a 
dead mouse.

2719
01:58:20,221 --> 01:58:22,680
The studio that night he opened for him 
in Irvine.

2720
01:58:22,710 --> 01:58:24,650
He brings a mitogen on the road with 
them too.

2721
01:58:24,690 --> 01:58:29,690
Yeah.
He just grabs people and it gives them 

2722
01:58:29,690 --> 01:58:29,690
chances a lot.
Like just random guys.

2723
01:58:29,690 --> 01:58:29,690
I know.
It's really neat.

2724
01:58:29,690 --> 01:58:30,810
Yeah.
Russell is a real good dude.

2725
01:58:31,140 --> 01:58:33,480
He's a real good dude.
There's a lot of good people in comedy.

2726
01:58:33,750 --> 01:58:38,750
You know,
it's an interesting thing about 

2727
01:58:38,750 --> 01:58:40,530
comedians and becoming friends with a 
bunch of them and you know,

2728
01:58:40,531 --> 01:58:42,010
it's like have to get the greatest

2729
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:43,580
people to communicate with,
you know,

2730
01:58:43,610 --> 01:58:46,150
cracks me up when people don't know that
we're really friends.

2731
01:58:46,240 --> 01:58:48,370
Like they think we're in constant 
competition.

2732
01:58:48,371 --> 01:58:51,130
My competition is with me trying to get 
better.

2733
01:58:51,370 --> 01:58:54,550
It's like somebody said to me,
I don't mean to offend you,

2734
01:58:54,551 --> 01:58:57,460
but I really like Robin Williams.
I said,

2735
01:58:57,461 --> 01:58:58,210
well,
you're allowed to.

2736
01:58:58,211 --> 01:59:03,211
Like I said,
what do you think somebody even said 

2737
01:59:03,211 --> 01:59:03,211
that about or about?
You know,

2738
01:59:03,211 --> 01:59:04,460
I just wanted to say I think he's funny.
I don't mean to offend you.

2739
01:59:04,690 --> 01:59:06,670
Offend me.
I think he's funny too.

2740
01:59:06,720 --> 01:59:08,210
I think he's great.
I go,

2741
01:59:08,710 --> 01:59:11,890
what do you think?
I think I carry comedy on my back and it

2742
01:59:11,891 --> 01:59:14,190
had there you insult me by liking 
another comedian.

2743
01:59:14,191 --> 01:59:14,570
It'd be a lot of

2744
01:59:14,700 --> 01:59:15,490
pressure.
Him.

2745
01:59:15,710 --> 01:59:17,610
You've always been a supporter of 
comedians.

2746
01:59:17,750 --> 01:59:21,130
You were always great.
You gave me great advice when,

2747
01:59:21,160 --> 01:59:24,180
when I was first coming up with the 
store.

2748
01:59:24,181 --> 01:59:26,970
You always,
always when somebody have a good set,

2749
01:59:26,971 --> 01:59:30,770
you would always be like really a 
complimentary and you know,

2750
01:59:31,170 --> 01:59:32,820
talk to them about what you really 
liked.

2751
01:59:32,940 --> 01:59:34,760
Some communities I'll do that shit.
So committees,

2752
01:59:34,790 --> 01:59:39,790
they never good.
Never go up to a young guy and give him 

2753
01:59:39,790 --> 01:59:39,790
props.
I mean I'd love to fucking.

2754
01:59:39,790 --> 01:59:39,790
And

2755
01:59:40,500 --> 01:59:42,390
when you did that,
when Joe,

2756
01:59:42,391 --> 01:59:45,750
your face,
when you did new rules are and of course

2757
01:59:45,770 --> 01:59:48,630
Mary Joe is one of the funniest,
I swear to God,

2758
01:59:48,631 --> 01:59:51,120
your neck got longer.
That was a bid that we,

2759
01:59:51,121 --> 01:59:52,170
new rules

2760
01:59:52,510 --> 01:59:56,580
can not work and eat it and kill.
And that was a bit.

2761
01:59:56,590 --> 02:00:01,590
It took a long time.
I remember coming up and telling you 

2762
02:00:01,590 --> 02:00:01,600
that because it me,
I was fucking crying.

2763
02:00:01,630 --> 02:00:05,140
New rules.
The 90 year old that I had to work.

2764
02:00:05,141 --> 02:00:08,230
I worked on that bid for a fucking year.
That was one of those bits that just,

2765
02:00:08,260 --> 02:00:10,540
I just kept tweaking it.
I could never get it right.

2766
02:00:10,660 --> 02:00:11,120
Yeah.
No,

2767
02:00:11,190 --> 02:00:16,190
I just,
I knew there was something in this just 

2768
02:00:16,190 --> 02:00:16,660
like my diamonds size.
But Damn,

2769
02:00:16,690 --> 02:00:19,420
you only opened up with it today.
You're going to be fine.

2770
02:00:19,870 --> 02:00:20,680
What do you got?
Their fellow?

2771
02:00:21,110 --> 02:00:21,540
Yeah,
I want to.

2772
02:00:21,550 --> 02:00:22,870
Energy drinks.
Yeah.

2773
02:00:22,871 --> 02:00:26,020
We're going to wrap this thing up.
So it's almost two hours in.

2774
02:00:26,260 --> 02:00:31,260
So where are you going to be next time?
I'll be at the hilarity next week and 

2775
02:00:31,260 --> 02:00:34,030
then two weeks I'll be.
Was it 25th?

2776
02:00:34,031 --> 02:00:37,330
I think captain.
Brian's 25th,

2777
02:00:37,680 --> 02:00:42,680
26th and you're on twitter.
Dom Irrera I r e r r a on twitter.

2778
02:00:43,960 --> 02:00:46,120
She was really nice meeting you,
Tom.

2779
02:00:46,390 --> 02:00:49,360
We already knew each other.
It was nice hanging out with you.

2780
02:00:49,510 --> 02:00:50,350
Oh,
okay.

2781
02:00:50,600 --> 02:00:55,600
Good.
Does anybody have any more xanax before 

2782
02:00:55,600 --> 02:00:58,081
we go?
Do you feel weird about revealing that 

2783
02:00:58,081 --> 02:00:58,081
to the world?
No,

2784
02:00:58,081 --> 02:00:58,390
I don't know.
You don't care?

2785
02:00:58,810 --> 02:00:59,700
I don't give a fuck.

2786
02:01:01,010 --> 02:01:02,420
That's the only.
The only thing.

2787
02:01:02,421 --> 02:01:04,730
The only reason I would like to be gay 
is just to come out.

2788
02:01:09,520 --> 02:01:10,710
They don't give a fuck,

2789
02:01:10,870 --> 02:01:14,740
but I mean I'm not gay because I like 
women so much but it would be like I was

2790
02:01:14,741 --> 02:01:19,741
thinking about it even at this point,
the way I look now and this is what's 

2791
02:01:19,741 --> 02:01:23,470
great about show business and you know,
is that I couldn't be gay if I wanted to

2792
02:01:23,740 --> 02:01:28,740
because I couldn't ever get guys as good
looking as the girls like it because 

2793
02:01:28,740 --> 02:01:31,681
guys are more superficial and into.
But you can get girls because they like 

2794
02:01:31,681 --> 02:01:32,160
talent and money.
No.

2795
02:01:32,161 --> 02:01:34,570
So anyway,
the guy who,

2796
02:01:35,140 --> 02:01:37,330
the guy who got thrown back into the 
closet,

2797
02:01:37,780 --> 02:01:39,920
we don't need you out here.
That's funny.

2798
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:45,280
I would like to be gay just so I can 
come out just so you can say it.

2799
02:01:47,051 --> 02:01:48,680
You don't give a fuck where you 
surprised when Kevin,

2800
02:01:48,681 --> 02:01:51,910
me and he came out.
It was like in his fifties show how many

2801
02:01:51,970 --> 02:01:53,310
per.
There's only a certain amount.

2802
02:01:53,510 --> 02:01:55,970
There's only a certain amount of show 
tunes you can sing.

2803
02:01:56,600 --> 02:02:00,110
Not Be gay.
I was surprised with todd glass.

2804
02:02:01,650 --> 02:02:04,790
I was as well.
You weren't surprised but I have a thing

2805
02:02:04,791 --> 02:02:09,791
on my phone of tagless talking to me.
They'll let you hear drunk.

2806
02:02:10,420 --> 02:02:10,790
No,
no,

2807
02:02:10,791 --> 02:02:11,300
no.
He,

2808
02:02:11,301 --> 02:02:16,301
I offended him and he called to 
reconcile it and the Florida radio 

2809
02:02:16,520 --> 02:02:20,840
station called me to bust his balls and 
I didn't realize what I was saying was.

2810
02:02:20,910 --> 02:02:23,300
And I like todd.
I would never want to hurt him,

2811
02:02:23,780 --> 02:02:26,150
but I was saying that he says you never 
thought I was funny,

2812
02:02:26,210 --> 02:02:26,570
didn't you?

2813
02:02:27,140 --> 02:02:30,170
I said I always thought you were funny.
I mean not like laugh out loud.

2814
02:02:30,171 --> 02:02:31,430
Funny.
But you know,

2815
02:02:32,360 --> 02:02:35,330
like he never going to go in and see it 
to go.

2816
02:02:35,360 --> 02:02:36,710
My stomach hurts.
But you know,

2817
02:02:36,711 --> 02:02:37,960
you were funny.
I mean you liked these,

2818
02:02:38,320 --> 02:02:40,700
the Tuesday,
Wednesday and Sunday headliner,

2819
02:02:41,150 --> 02:02:46,150
you know,
and I didn't know it but that's what he 

2820
02:02:46,150 --> 02:02:48,161
was doing that weekend.
I was crushing him and he's a very 

2821
02:02:48,161 --> 02:02:49,910
sensitive guy and if he hears just be,
here's this.

2822
02:02:49,911 --> 02:02:52,710
I love him.
But I was just joking around.

2823
02:02:52,740 --> 02:02:54,360
They didn't know I was hitting on some 
pumps,

2824
02:02:54,560 --> 02:02:55,670
sore points,
you know,

2825
02:02:55,700 --> 02:03:00,700
todd glass called me up after them and 
see if things somehow or another we got 

2826
02:03:00,700 --> 02:03:02,200
on the phone together and he was one,
oh,

2827
02:03:02,210 --> 02:03:02,870
like,
you know,

2828
02:03:02,871 --> 02:03:04,910
a lot of comedians were happy after that
went down.

2829
02:03:05,120 --> 02:03:10,120
But todd and I really didn't know each 
other very well and he was so 

2830
02:03:10,120 --> 02:03:12,440
enthusiastic and happy and he just said 
thank you.

2831
02:03:13,010 --> 02:03:15,050
Thank you.
Just thank you for doing it.

2832
02:03:15,080 --> 02:03:20,080
And he dropped to his knees.
I'm glad now in retrospect that I didn't

2833
02:03:20,961 --> 02:03:25,670
give a big long hug and both of my 
parents are retired and go crazy.

2834
02:03:26,600 --> 02:03:29,600
Both of my parents are care,
gay recharge.

2835
02:03:29,870 --> 02:03:30,380
But,
you know,

2836
02:03:30,770 --> 02:03:32,930
there was a few people that were 
fascinated by it,

2837
02:03:32,931 --> 02:03:36,510
but he was super thankful and I talked 
with,

2838
02:03:36,550 --> 02:03:37,480
you know,
um,

2839
02:03:38,150 --> 02:03:40,640
kindler and I briefly said,
you know,

2840
02:03:40,641 --> 02:03:43,220
we're like maybe there should be some 
sort of a fucking comedians union,

2841
02:03:43,360 --> 02:03:44,400
you know,
it shouldn't be a union.

2842
02:03:44,660 --> 02:03:49,160
They tried it,
they tried it in New York with the was.

2843
02:03:49,210 --> 02:03:51,170
But that was about like pay at the 
clubs,

2844
02:03:51,171 --> 02:03:52,170
right?
Is that what it was about?

2845
02:03:52,190 --> 02:03:52,750
No,
no,

2846
02:03:52,760 --> 02:03:57,550
it was past that it was about a health 
insurance and joining a unionized.

2847
02:03:57,560 --> 02:04:00,110
But it's tough when everybody's in 
competition with each other for,

2848
02:04:00,740 --> 02:04:01,430
for jobs.

2849
02:04:01,430 --> 02:04:04,850
I think the only place it would work is 
if you know,

2850
02:04:04,910 --> 02:04:07,310
when you have to get rid of fees that,
that,

2851
02:04:07,340 --> 02:04:12,340
that is when having comedians together,
like people don't understand the issue 

2852
02:04:12,340 --> 02:04:14,420
behind thievery.
And that's why there was a lot of people

2853
02:04:14,421 --> 02:04:17,780
that thought that what I did was really 
douchey and when we released that Carlos

2854
02:04:17,840 --> 02:04:22,840
video,
but when you have someone who is being 

2855
02:04:22,840 --> 02:04:25,960
unchecked and they're doing well and 
they're just running through the comedy 

2856
02:04:25,960 --> 02:04:26,120
world,
like people don't understand what that's

2857
02:04:26,121 --> 02:04:31,121
like.
It's like you're working with someone 

2858
02:04:31,121 --> 02:04:32,770
who just might steal your car and no one
else that you work with is going to do 

2859
02:04:32,770 --> 02:04:33,710
shit about it.
The guy just going to steal your car.

2860
02:04:33,711 --> 02:04:38,711
I mean,
really that what it's like a joke is 

2861
02:04:38,711 --> 02:04:38,750
actually worth more than A.
Hey,

2862
02:04:38,760 --> 02:04:40,680
how about this?
How about Bob Hope Joke.

2863
02:04:40,770 --> 02:04:41,510
We're at the fucking.

2864
02:04:41,850 --> 02:04:42,880
We're at the,
uh,

2865
02:04:43,040 --> 02:04:44,460
word,
the Jerry's Deli today.

2866
02:04:44,461 --> 02:04:46,650
He launched into chick came over and 
quoted one of your jokes.

2867
02:04:46,651 --> 02:04:47,520
I mean,
think about that joke.

2868
02:04:47,670 --> 02:04:50,100
That's a fucking 15,
20 year old joke,

2869
02:04:50,101 --> 02:04:55,101
right?
Let me think about how much that's 

2870
02:04:55,101 --> 02:04:55,101
worth,
that's worth more than a car to somebody

2871
02:04:55,101 --> 02:04:56,550
could just get exhausted.
Hospital happened and what we're reading

2872
02:04:56,730 --> 02:05:01,730
so someone could just gag that.
They could just steal that right in 

2873
02:05:01,730 --> 02:05:03,380
front of you.
And we had like a real problem with.

2874
02:05:03,420 --> 02:05:08,420
We've got a problem with a couple of 
guys at the store when you watched that 

2875
02:05:08,420 --> 02:05:08,760
shit happen and you know,
you've seen it all.

2876
02:05:08,761 --> 02:05:12,240
We've all seen it happen several times 
throughout our career.

2877
02:05:12,241 --> 02:05:17,241
A guy who comes along,
it's just a fucking buccaneer who just 

2878
02:05:17,241 --> 02:05:20,541
grabbing them from all over the place 
and nobody wants to do anything about 

2879
02:05:20,541 --> 02:05:23,721
it.
That's the time where I think something 

2880
02:05:23,721 --> 02:05:23,980
like a comedy union would help,
you know,

2881
02:05:23,990 --> 02:05:28,990
we,
we could all get together and just all 

2882
02:05:28,990 --> 02:05:29,610
of us unanimously say,
Ladies and gentlemen of the audience,

2883
02:05:29,611 --> 02:05:31,450
you people out there that,
that paint see,

2884
02:05:31,451 --> 02:05:32,340
stand up comedy.

2885
02:05:32,700 --> 02:05:35,760
This guy's a fucking thief and this is 
just what it is.

2886
02:05:35,980 --> 02:05:38,130
Signed by Rera,
Tim Allen,

2887
02:05:38,131 --> 02:05:38,670
blah,
blah blah.

2888
02:05:38,671 --> 02:05:43,671
You know what I say to an obscure 
reference to pull out the will of people

2889
02:05:46,530 --> 02:05:51,530
I never even heard you mentioned him and
I think I left and I never have met him 

2890
02:05:51,530 --> 02:05:51,530
once.
He was a nice guy,

2891
02:05:51,540 --> 02:05:56,540
very nice guy.
Went on stage at the comedy store is 

2892
02:05:56,540 --> 02:05:56,540
doing a joke about his Ferrari breaking 
down.

2893
02:05:56,540 --> 02:05:57,820
That's something everybody can relate to
her.

2894
02:05:58,390 --> 02:06:03,390
Yeah.
It pissed me off because I had to drive 

2895
02:06:03,390 --> 02:06:05,340
my mazur roddy that day and I hate that 
it was sticking it in your face.

2896
02:06:05,341 --> 02:06:10,341
Dom Dom had a cadillac once where he put
a vinyl roof on it.

2897
02:06:11,600 --> 02:06:16,600
You know,
when you get one of those nice smushy 

2898
02:06:16,600 --> 02:06:18,291
roofs,
it might have been one of the last ones 

2899
02:06:18,291 --> 02:06:18,291
made in America.
Like you have the cabinet in the.

2900
02:06:18,291 --> 02:06:19,440
You had the roof put on.
I remember you like,

2901
02:06:19,560 --> 02:06:24,560
I think I'm going to get a nice soft is 
such a fucking awesome Guinea move and 

2902
02:06:26,821 --> 02:06:27,720
I,
I,

2903
02:06:28,770 --> 02:06:33,770
I embrace so many things Guinea.
But I thought it was hilarious that you 

2904
02:06:33,770 --> 02:06:33,770
were doing that.
I was like,

2905
02:06:33,770 --> 02:06:33,930
Yay,
go for it.

2906
02:06:33,960 --> 02:06:37,110
I want to get a pinky ring to fucking 
boom.

2907
02:06:37,111 --> 02:06:40,070
Bada boom by each other.
You know,

2908
02:06:40,120 --> 02:06:41,850
you,
you and you went and you got it done.

2909
02:06:41,851 --> 02:06:46,851
Yeah.
That he had a nice cadillac and yet the 

2910
02:06:46,851 --> 02:06:49,160
back end.
You had a nice a vinyl roof put on like 

2911
02:06:49,160 --> 02:06:49,160
this.
It looks classier.

2912
02:06:49,160 --> 02:06:53,540
Remember when cars had those brawls at 
the front that you used to be a big 

2913
02:06:53,550 --> 02:06:56,380
super close super leather,
but borrow.

2914
02:06:56,550 --> 02:06:59,220
A friend of mine had an a Mazda rx 
seven.

2915
02:06:59,310 --> 02:07:04,310
One of the fucking cool years,
like with the flip up headlights and 

2916
02:07:04,310 --> 02:07:04,640
shit and he had abroad.

2917
02:07:04,650 --> 02:07:06,450
I was like,
that might be the dopest cowell time.

2918
02:07:07,110 --> 02:07:12,110
Mazda had a hell of a car in that rx 
seven to like one of the last models 

2919
02:07:12,110 --> 02:07:16,131
right around the time where accurate 
came out with the NSX around that other 

2920
02:07:16,131 --> 02:07:17,870
and Toyota came out with the supra is 
you're not in the cards.

2921
02:07:17,900 --> 02:07:20,310
John Merera doesn't even have a 
navigation system.

2922
02:07:20,450 --> 02:07:21,480
How about that?
Well,

2923
02:07:21,500 --> 02:07:23,630
I tell them I wouldn't be able to figure
it out anyway.

2924
02:07:24,170 --> 02:07:29,010
You're burning it up and so reduce.
Susie has the navigation.

2925
02:07:29,650 --> 02:07:32,520
Then he used to have as far as like you 
have.

2926
02:07:32,521 --> 02:07:37,521
I mean my God,
they're incredible and I'm fucking 

2927
02:07:37,521 --> 02:07:40,390
terrorize being with driving around.
You go from point a to point B in 60 

2928
02:07:40,390 --> 02:07:42,970
minutes.
It's unbelievable and I was getting like

2929
02:07:42,971 --> 02:07:47,971
jeeves from getting thrown back,
but I tried to act normal heads hitting 

2930
02:07:47,971 --> 02:07:52,051
the thing,
but the most cathartic thing about this 

2931
02:07:52,051 --> 02:07:52,051
whole experience was I finally got to 
tell you,

2932
02:07:52,300 --> 02:07:53,480
I was afraid of the pimples.

2933
02:07:55,050 --> 02:08:00,050
I told you without reason,
I never wanted you to think and I never 

2934
02:08:00,050 --> 02:08:02,590
had the heart to tell you that I didn't 
want to come to your house.

2935
02:08:03,850 --> 02:08:05,140
Not a pushy person.
No,

2936
02:08:05,141 --> 02:08:05,820
but I mean,
you know,

2937
02:08:05,970 --> 02:08:08,650
there's always a need coming into 
Hollywood shooting pool with me.

2938
02:08:08,651 --> 02:08:11,290
There was no.
It's nice to get that off my chest.

2939
02:08:11,320 --> 02:08:16,320
Just finally admitted that even that 
they were shooting and those doors were 

2940
02:08:16,320 --> 02:08:18,070
just walking around.
Just solid muscle and teeth.

2941
02:08:18,580 --> 02:08:21,150
Fucking jaws of death.
Ernest sweeties.

2942
02:08:21,190 --> 02:08:22,840
I believe that,
but there's always that.

2943
02:08:22,841 --> 02:08:26,290
One time I will wait to meet Johnny 
cash.

2944
02:08:26,320 --> 02:08:28,450
Johnny cash is my master.
He's a sweetheart.

2945
02:08:28,510 --> 02:08:29,200
Oh,
he's outside.

2946
02:08:29,320 --> 02:08:31,690
He's nice dog.
He's way bigger than the pimples,

2947
02:08:31,691 --> 02:08:34,040
so maybe I met him another time blocking
you.

2948
02:08:34,240 --> 02:08:35,920
That's a big dog.
I made them another.

2949
02:08:35,930 --> 02:08:37,600
He's so strong.
It's ridiculous.

2950
02:08:37,640 --> 02:08:39,520
I've never had a dog that's as strong as
him.

2951
02:08:39,730 --> 02:08:42,790
It's a dog where you read.
Like if he lunges for something,

2952
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:48,000
I got a drop down and dig in with both 
my feet and hang on a horse.

2953
02:08:48,160 --> 02:08:48,970
See,
here's the problem.

2954
02:08:49,300 --> 02:08:51,110
He's going to know I'm afraid of him.
No,

2955
02:08:51,190 --> 02:08:52,630
he's a sweetheart.
But he knows.

2956
02:08:52,631 --> 02:08:53,600
They sense it.
Yeah,

2957
02:08:53,750 --> 02:08:58,750
but trust me,
he's going to go right from my mastiffs 

2958
02:08:58,750 --> 02:09:02,880
is they're very confident because 
they're not worried about you at all 

2959
02:09:02,880 --> 02:09:03,310
masters and never worried about a person
beating their ass.

2960
02:09:03,311 --> 02:09:07,030
They just the headmasters,
because they're so confident,

2961
02:09:07,090 --> 02:09:09,880
they're so big and so strong.
They are very nice,

2962
02:09:10,210 --> 02:09:11,860
like they don't.
They're not insecure.

2963
02:09:11,861 --> 02:09:16,861
Like there's certain certain dogs that 
feel like they have to establish 

2964
02:09:16,861 --> 02:09:17,590
dominance over person or scare a person.
Mastiffs.

2965
02:09:17,591 --> 02:09:19,420
They're not like that.
If they're barking at you,

2966
02:09:19,421 --> 02:09:24,421
it's real.
If a massive is angry at you and 

2967
02:09:24,421 --> 02:09:27,220
barking,
you better realize you gotta fucking 

2968
02:09:27,220 --> 02:09:27,790
real problem because a dog that's that 
big.

2969
02:09:27,940 --> 02:09:30,670
You're talking about 150 to 200 pound 
dog.

2970
02:09:31,030 --> 02:09:34,450
Do you know how strong that fucking let 
those dogs and with the kids.

2971
02:09:34,690 --> 02:09:35,780
Of course,
yeah,

2972
02:09:36,310 --> 02:09:41,310
we play with the kids,
but that I'm sure enough to have them 

2973
02:09:41,310 --> 02:09:41,500
around kids.
If you can't trust the dog around kids,

2974
02:09:41,501 --> 02:09:44,260
you can't have that dog.
My Dog's exhibit.

2975
02:09:44,261 --> 02:09:46,300
No aggression.
You have two masters?

2976
02:09:46,480 --> 02:09:48,400
No.
The other one's a bulldog mix.

2977
02:09:48,490 --> 02:09:51,280
He's a very lazy dog,
but he's a sweetheart too.

2978
02:09:51,340 --> 02:09:52,930
They're both real nice dogs,
man.

2979
02:09:53,020 --> 02:09:55,180
Joe,
do you know anything about the Honda Crx

2980
02:09:55,190 --> 02:09:57,910
z?
Is that that a hybrid thing?

2981
02:09:58,290 --> 02:10:03,290
Hybrid.
I saw one the other day and it was 

2982
02:10:03,290 --> 02:10:03,290
amazing.
It looked like a spaceship go.

2983
02:10:03,290 --> 02:10:04,920
Have you seen what they're doing now in 
a car?

2984
02:10:04,930 --> 02:10:06,720
They're putting stitcher in a gang of 
cars.

2985
02:10:07,060 --> 02:10:09,520
Going to be in BMW's.
BMW's.

2986
02:10:09,521 --> 02:10:14,521
It's forward.
It's a all the big guys and now they 

2987
02:10:14,521 --> 02:10:14,980
also have three g on here and like,
like I said the other day,

2988
02:10:15,160 --> 02:10:17,290
this new ipad has the four g light on 
it.

2989
02:10:17,291 --> 02:10:18,070
Verizon,
yeah.

2990
02:10:18,071 --> 02:10:21,850
It's faster than my business clash.
A charter at my studio.

2991
02:10:21,880 --> 02:10:23,620
That's incredible.
I've got four G,

2992
02:10:23,640 --> 02:10:26,080
a car that I put in my laptop.
I'm pretty happy with it.

2993
02:10:26,081 --> 02:10:28,420
When you actually get a four g 
connection on the road.

2994
02:10:28,421 --> 02:10:33,421
It's a little sketchy though,
but it's always better than the shit 

2995
02:10:33,421 --> 02:10:34,070
that's in the hotel room if you've seen.
Well,

2996
02:10:34,070 --> 02:10:39,070
first of all,
let's talk about their fucking virus 

2997
02:10:39,070 --> 02:10:39,070
that we both thought we got.
Yeah,

2998
02:10:39,070 --> 02:10:39,830
so don't know.
It's the flashback virus.

2999
02:10:39,831 --> 02:10:42,530
If you're using a Mac and you think that
you can't get a Trojan,

3000
02:10:42,860 --> 02:10:44,720
it's not really a virus.
It's a Trojan.

3001
02:10:44,750 --> 02:10:48,590
It's an exploit through Java and it's a 
guess.

3002
02:10:48,591 --> 02:10:52,790
It only works if you don't have your 
Java updated to the latest and greatest.

3003
02:10:52,830 --> 02:10:53,340
Yeah.
If you.

3004
02:10:53,341 --> 02:10:55,290
If you're one of those people that keep 
your shit updated,

3005
02:10:55,291 --> 02:10:56,820
you,
you're really not going to have to worry

3006
02:10:56,821 --> 02:10:58,230
about it.
That though.

3007
02:10:58,231 --> 02:10:59,370
I wouldn't say that.
Also,

3008
02:10:59,380 --> 02:11:04,380
it's also it's,
it's only if you go to some really 

3009
02:11:04,380 --> 02:11:05,790
sketchy website,
the more I read about it and also just a

3010
02:11:05,791 --> 02:11:10,791
way to test it to see if you have it and
I tested mine and I go to the filthiest 

3011
02:11:10,791 --> 02:11:12,750
fucking places in the world and I didn't
have it.

3012
02:11:12,751 --> 02:11:15,330
I mean I did look at torrent websites.
What do you do?

3013
02:11:15,650 --> 02:11:17,780
You open up terminal and you have to cut
and paste this.

3014
02:11:17,870 --> 02:11:19,710
A couple of different lines of code in 
it.

3015
02:11:20,160 --> 02:11:22,320
The easiest way to to actually figure it
out.

3016
02:11:22,321 --> 02:11:26,670
If you go to a nine to five.com,
our Mac nine to five.com.

3017
02:11:26,671 --> 02:11:28,590
What is that website,
right Mac?

3018
02:11:28,591 --> 02:11:33,591
Nine to five.
It was if you just googled Mac virus 

3019
02:11:33,591 --> 02:11:36,880
will come up with a couple pages and 
there's links to the code that you cut 

3020
02:11:36,880 --> 02:11:41,430
and paste into your browser and it's a 
nine to five Mac.com

3021
02:11:41,431 --> 02:11:45,600
is the one that I saw at on and it's 
pretty much you just type in these codes

3022
02:11:45,840 --> 02:11:47,750
and if you don't,
if it,

3023
02:11:47,820 --> 02:11:52,820
it tells you what to look for and what 
not to look for to tell you if you have 

3024
02:11:52,820 --> 02:11:52,820
it.

3025
02:11:52,820 --> 02:11:52,820
But you know,
honestly,

3026
02:11:52,820 --> 02:11:56,961
the only thing you really have to do is 
just open up your little apple on the 

3027
02:11:56,961 --> 02:11:56,961
left hand corner,
hit,

3028
02:11:56,961 --> 02:12:01,140
uh,
hit it and then go to system update and 

3029
02:12:01,140 --> 02:12:01,140
there's a Java update,
uh,

3030
02:12:01,140 --> 02:12:03,330
in that if you have that,
we'll patch it.

3031
02:12:03,331 --> 02:12:05,820
And if it's not in there already,
I mean check to make sure you have it.

3032
02:12:05,821 --> 02:12:10,821
Then you must have already done some 
people say you shouldn't have Java on 

3033
02:12:10,821 --> 02:12:11,100
your browser.
You should enabled the problem.

3034
02:12:11,670 --> 02:12:14,190
The problem is is yeah,
well when you go to any kind of,

3035
02:12:14,220 --> 02:12:16,890
when you first get your laptop,
when you first get your Mac,

3036
02:12:16,920 --> 02:12:19,080
that's the one of the first things that 
comes up.

3037
02:12:19,480 --> 02:12:21,450
It's like,
would you like to Install Java?

3038
02:12:21,570 --> 02:12:24,930
Like is not a part of the operating 
system is not a part of windows.

3039
02:12:25,290 --> 02:12:28,280
It's a third party thing that you add to
your browser.

3040
02:12:28,610 --> 02:12:30,210
Pretty much.
So it's a plugin.

3041
02:12:30,390 --> 02:12:35,390
Like I just had it turned off on this 
laptop over here and I tried to go to 

3042
02:12:35,390 --> 02:12:38,661
that Honda website and it didn't work.
The Honda website didn't work because I 

3043
02:12:38,661 --> 02:12:39,330
didn't have a job enabled so I enabled 
it.

3044
02:12:39,331 --> 02:12:40,780
Now it works.
I checked the,

3045
02:12:40,800 --> 02:12:44,940
this laptop and his Mac or this Imac.
You updated it last night.

3046
02:12:44,941 --> 02:12:48,700
So it's everything's cool and it's.
If you're looking at.

3047
02:12:48,720 --> 02:12:52,200
If you go to nine to five Mac.com
and you look at the map that,

3048
02:12:52,500 --> 02:12:57,500
that like who's infected,
you know there is a lot of people 

3049
02:12:57,500 --> 02:13:00,591
infected but this is,
we're talking about rural to Ra 

3050
02:13:00,591 --> 02:13:00,591
worldwide.
Will did.

3051
02:13:00,591 --> 02:13:03,820
Rolled Don verus say that he had 
someone,

3052
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:09,000
Don dot Mary's had a meltdown last night
on the stage because he had his facebook

3053
02:13:10,381 --> 02:13:13,860
hacked and his gmail hack.
So then he went in there and changed all

3054
02:13:13,861 --> 02:13:18,861
this shit and then they hacked it again 
and he pretty much on stage was like,

3055
02:13:19,231 --> 02:13:19,920
you know what I give up.

3056
02:13:20,190 --> 02:13:23,520
I'm not putting my,
I'm not doing any more podcasts anymore.

3057
02:13:23,521 --> 02:13:25,490
I'm not,
I'm done with this Dingdong shut.

3058
02:13:25,491 --> 02:13:27,270
Like it really freaked him out that 
people.

3059
02:13:27,810 --> 02:13:30,290
These are the freaking mountain dom.
You Got Xanax farm.

3060
02:13:31,040 --> 02:13:31,590
Well it's,
it's,

3061
02:13:31,591 --> 02:13:36,591
it's the point that I mean like,
like we were talking about this the 

3062
02:13:36,591 --> 02:13:36,591
other day.
So if a,

3063
02:13:36,591 --> 02:13:38,790
if an ex girlfriend finds your cell 
phone and looks through your cell phone,

3064
02:13:38,940 --> 02:13:42,890
that scary sometimes like you don't know
what you fucking say to your friends are

3065
02:13:42,891 --> 02:13:43,250
like,
you know,

3066
02:13:43,260 --> 02:13:46,800
like,
do you should've just kidding.

3067
02:13:47,780 --> 02:13:50,350
Maybe not.
Yeah.

3068
02:13:50,520 --> 02:13:52,650
Oh well it's like a I,
if I ever die,

3069
02:13:52,651 --> 02:13:55,940
my parents find my fucking laptop and 
they have to go through it and sort of.

3070
02:13:56,330 --> 02:13:58,800
That's the most scary shit ever.
My Mom's gonna be like,

3071
02:13:58,801 --> 02:14:00,210
what's wrong,
Brian?

3072
02:14:00,360 --> 02:14:01,680
And then it can't be like,
mom.

3073
02:14:01,681 --> 02:14:06,681
No,
I downloaded those for photoshop so I 

3074
02:14:06,681 --> 02:14:06,681
could put joe's face on it and it's an 
honest message board.

3075
02:14:06,681 --> 02:14:11,480
You know what I mean?
Like choke pitchers are really into 

3076
02:14:11,480 --> 02:14:11,480
black day.
Yeah,

3077
02:14:11,480 --> 02:14:15,291
exactly.
I think of that when I'm jerking off on 

3078
02:14:15,291 --> 02:14:15,291
the couch and there's porns leapt out if
I died,

3079
02:14:15,470 --> 02:14:17,600
like who would walk in and see what,
you know,

3080
02:14:17,610 --> 02:14:18,640
how perverted they aren't.
Yeah,

3081
02:14:18,690 --> 02:14:21,510
exactly.
So now imagine,

3082
02:14:21,540 --> 02:14:24,870
imagine the whole Internet being able to
do that to your computer,

3083
02:14:24,871 --> 02:14:27,240
not your mom,
not your fucking girlfriend.

3084
02:14:27,250 --> 02:14:32,250
Looking at your phone.
Now imagine the whole Internet being 

3085
02:14:32,250 --> 02:14:32,250
able to access your computer.
That's fucking terrifying.

3086
02:14:32,990 --> 02:14:34,240
It was terrifying.
Yeah,

3087
02:14:34,750 --> 02:14:36,870
it's going to happen.
I really think that,

3088
02:14:36,900 --> 02:14:38,010
you know,
we talked about,

3089
02:14:38,011 --> 02:14:39,360
uh,
with everlast the other day,

3090
02:14:39,510 --> 02:14:42,720
we're like secrets or on the way out at 
a certain point in time,

3091
02:14:42,721 --> 02:14:44,950
everything you do online,
someone's going to be able to read it.

3092
02:14:45,660 --> 02:14:49,170
Someone's going to be able to listen to 
your phone calls are going to be able to

3093
02:14:49,171 --> 02:14:49,830
access.

3094
02:14:49,860 --> 02:14:51,210
That's what I said last night.
I was like,

3095
02:14:51,480 --> 02:14:52,080
Joe,
you know,

3096
02:14:52,081 --> 02:14:57,081
there's like at least seven people in 
New Zealand right now listening to this 

3097
02:14:57,081 --> 02:14:57,810
phone call that are ahead of us in 
technology that can.

3098
02:14:57,811 --> 02:15:00,390
It's probably boring tiger woods with a 
great example,

3099
02:15:00,391 --> 02:15:02,400
like when I was a kid,
baseball players,

3100
02:15:02,401 --> 02:15:07,401
they'll cheat on their wives,
but the sports writers knew what they 

3101
02:15:07,401 --> 02:15:07,401
didn't.
They didn't rat him out.

3102
02:15:07,401 --> 02:15:08,910
But today's world,
you know,

3103
02:15:09,560 --> 02:15:11,430
they traced down everything.
Yeah.

3104
02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:12,690
You know,
and he wouldn't,

3105
02:15:12,691 --> 02:15:16,940
he wouldn't even been in trouble.
What Michael Jordan probably did is,

3106
02:15:17,040 --> 02:15:18,540
you know,
double that.

3107
02:15:18,570 --> 02:15:23,570
I mean Michael Jordan in his prime 
goddamn tornado sweeping white women 

3108
02:15:23,851 --> 02:15:26,100
through the air like semis.
Could you see that?

3109
02:15:26,101 --> 02:15:31,101
A video footage of Dallas,
the fucking tornado hitting Dallas and 

3110
02:15:31,101 --> 02:15:34,580
semis were flying through the air like 
paper Dom 18 wheelers full 18.

3111
02:15:34,741 --> 02:15:36,120
We're lose 30,
40,

3112
02:15:36,121 --> 02:15:38,070
50 feet in the air,
just spinning in circles.

3113
02:15:38,070 --> 02:15:39,960
It's fucking crazy.
It's crazy.

3114
02:15:40,370 --> 02:15:42,420
It's really weird to watch,
man.

3115
02:15:42,510 --> 02:15:43,740
I would highly recommend.
Now,

3116
02:15:43,790 --> 02:15:48,790
uh,
this is something that I'm personally 

3117
02:15:48,790 --> 02:15:50,541
going to start doing,
is to take your fucking computer and 

3118
02:15:50,541 --> 02:15:51,300
empty it all out onto external hard 
drives.

3119
02:15:51,301 --> 02:15:56,301
And then unplug those external hard 
drives from your computer and only use 

3120
02:15:56,301 --> 02:15:57,860
them when you need to or make him.
Yeah,

3121
02:15:58,220 --> 02:16:02,100
but I mean it only takes it like if,
if people are hacking Max and people are

3122
02:16:02,130 --> 02:16:06,210
doing this shit now they feel like wiki 
leaks and all this fucking crazy shit.

3123
02:16:06,360 --> 02:16:08,700
If you really want to fucking protect 
these woody,

3124
02:16:08,720 --> 02:16:13,720
the government.
Well I mean I think hackers are way 

3125
02:16:13,720 --> 02:16:16,180
above what we know that they are.
You know,

3126
02:16:16,350 --> 02:16:21,350
I think people are downloading fucking 
large amounts of information about 

3127
02:16:21,350 --> 02:16:25,100
anyone.
I think there's fucking message boards 

3128
02:16:25,100 --> 02:16:25,100
that people probably go,
all right,

3129
02:16:25,100 --> 02:16:25,500
who should we look at their computer 
today?

3130
02:16:25,680 --> 02:16:26,630
Oh,
let's go to a seat.

3131
02:16:26,640 --> 02:16:30,100
Steven Seagal is,
let's see this new thing on the

3132
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:35,100
cover of wired.
This month's wired about the NSA 

3133
02:16:35,100 --> 02:16:38,130
building,
like the most incredible security spying

3134
02:16:38,620 --> 02:16:43,620
computer system ever where they're going
to be able to literally keep a data 

3135
02:16:43,620 --> 02:16:46,150
record of every phone call you make 
every text you send,

3136
02:16:46,151 --> 02:16:49,160
every,
every phone call to get out.

3137
02:16:50,350 --> 02:16:55,350
I mean,
could you just stop and imagine that 

3138
02:16:55,350 --> 02:16:55,350
the,
the,

3139
02:16:55,350 --> 02:16:58,040
the ability to record every single phone
call that gets made throughout the 

3140
02:16:58,040 --> 02:16:59,770
entire country all the time.
Well doesn't like when we,

3141
02:16:59,800 --> 02:17:04,800
when the Dell is a dell,
there's a big computer somewhere that 

3142
02:17:04,800 --> 02:17:07,180
has all these information on it for 
years.

3143
02:17:07,230 --> 02:17:09,520
And then finally it gets thrown out.
Like everything we did,

3144
02:17:10,270 --> 02:17:12,370
everything we did on the computer is 
stored somewhere.

3145
02:17:13,270 --> 02:17:13,960
That's what I've heard.

3146
02:17:16,030 --> 02:17:17,500
I have no.
I have no backup.

3147
02:17:18,070 --> 02:17:19,870
Guys would agree with Newton cars.
Brian,

3148
02:17:19,871 --> 02:17:21,310
you're getting so bored with this 
podcast,

3149
02:17:22,090 --> 02:17:23,710
by the way.
Now I'm doing Cleveland,

3150
02:17:23,711 --> 02:17:25,660
let's say,
and it's long doing Cleveland this week.

3151
02:17:26,290 --> 02:17:26,910
Oh,

3152
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:28,690
I'm kidding.
Next week.

3153
02:17:28,691 --> 02:17:30,510
They're cheap too.
Not saying it's long.

3154
02:17:30,520 --> 02:17:31,570
I get it.
That was a joke.

3155
02:17:31,590 --> 02:17:32,380
Yeah.
Dom,

3156
02:17:33,070 --> 02:17:34,810
Joe,
come love.

3157
02:17:35,110 --> 02:17:37,100
Love you buddy.
Boy.

3158
02:17:37,150 --> 02:17:41,200
Fucking buying cars online over here.
I'm going to price it just.

3159
02:17:41,210 --> 02:17:46,210
Well,
I just wanted to know how much I saw 

3160
02:17:46,210 --> 02:17:46,210
today and I really was.
Cool.

3161
02:17:46,210 --> 02:17:47,500
Impulsivity child can stay off a 
website.

3162
02:17:48,170 --> 02:17:50,770
This God damn podcast.
Get this guy's on Xanax.

3163
02:17:51,130 --> 02:17:55,510
You're on marijuana.
I'm on marijuana and coconut water.

3164
02:17:55,680 --> 02:17:57,340
C,
two is delicious by the way.

3165
02:17:57,460 --> 02:17:58,060
It is,
right?

3166
02:17:58,120 --> 02:18:00,610
Isn't it one of your sponsors?
No,

3167
02:18:00,611 --> 02:18:01,780
not really.
They're all friends though.

3168
02:18:01,810 --> 02:18:02,330
See Two.
Oh,

3169
02:18:02,331 --> 02:18:03,980
it's the best was white.
Oh,

3170
02:18:04,040 --> 02:18:04,690
coconut water.

3171
02:18:04,690 --> 02:18:09,690
So delicious is because uh,
it comes from Thailand and they have a 

3172
02:18:09,690 --> 02:18:10,040
very specific,
uh,

3173
02:18:10,330 --> 02:18:14,320
like it's a small boutique company,
very specific type of coconut.

3174
02:18:14,321 --> 02:18:16,180
It's,
it's a small tree to apparently show.

3175
02:18:16,181 --> 02:18:18,070
Can you go over your sponsors for the 
meeting one more time?

3176
02:18:18,400 --> 02:18:23,400
I can,
but before that I will tell you Atlanta

3188
02:18:44,160 --> 02:18:45,040

I wasn't looking.

3196
02:18:53,080 --> 02:18:58,080
I was depressed for your ride of a bit 
smarter as it wouldn't sneak a plugin.

02:20:25,330 --> 02:20:25,490
And I could have done a special about a 
year ago.

3234
02:20:25,610 --> 02:20:30,610
So this is,
I think is my best stuff ever because 

3235
02:20:30,610 --> 02:20:32,000
it's real tight and it's been more than 
two years since my last one.

3236
02:20:32,300 --> 02:20:37,300
So I'm coming out guns blazing bitches.

Freddy Lockhart.

3248
02:21:03,190 --> 02:21:08,190
Do you have a show show?
We did a show at the ice house with Doug

3249
02:21:08,300 --> 02:21:09,020
Benson.
Joe Diaz.

3250

Jason Teebo.
He did.

3251
02:21:11,510 --> 02:21:15,890
Joey did.
I said Doug Benson,

3252
02:21:16,330 --> 02:21:17,250
Benson,
and mindset.

3253
02:21:17,510 --> 02:21:20,270
But it's going to be a hell of a Goddamn
show and it sells out quick as it's only

3254
02:21:20,271 --> 02:21:20,990
85 seats.

3255
02:21:22,150 --> 02:21:24,350
Oh,
are you doing the other room?

3256
02:21:24,730 --> 02:21:25,910
When are we going to do that other room 
again?

3257
02:21:25,911 --> 02:21:27,980
That was fun.
Have the main room.

3258
02:21:28,190 --> 02:21:29,840
We'll try to do that again.
That's hard to get them.

3259
02:21:29,900 --> 02:21:30,590
Yeah,
that was good.

3260
02:21:30,650 --> 02:21:32,270
We gotta get that Shit.
Will look at it in advance.

3261
02:21:32,310 --> 02:21:35,880
What's hard to get a last minute main 
room at ice house.

3262
02:21:36,530 --> 02:21:37,850
That shit in advance.
