1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:03,900
Four,
three,

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,040
two,
one,

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:08,240
boom.
And we're live 12 rules for life.

4
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:13,270
So without reading this.
So what you're saying is sort of like 

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,440
there's only 12 things you need to know 
in life,

6
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:16,280
right?
That's it.

7
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:16,940
Yeah.
Well,

8
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:17,930
yeah.
This,

9
00:00:17,931 --> 00:00:22,931
um,
this interview that you just did with 

10
00:00:22,931 --> 00:00:22,940
this woman cathy new mission,
was that in the UK?

11
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,340
It was channel four UK.
Um,

12
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,740
I just went,
I felt bad,

13
00:00:27,741 --> 00:00:32,741
but I was also laughing.
I went to her twitter page to read like 

14
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:36,461
an in with each one of her tweets.
No matter what she says someone writes 

15
00:00:36,461 --> 00:00:38,330
underneath it.
So what you're saying is,

16
00:00:38,331 --> 00:00:40,700
and then some ridiculous,
but by the way,

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,840
the,
your fans were mocking her but politely,

18
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:51,260
non aggressively their idea.
I didn't read any rude things like there

19
00:00:51,261 --> 00:00:56,261
was no,
there was no insults or maybe a few 

20
00:00:56,261 --> 00:00:56,810
insults,
but there's no swears.

21
00:00:56,811 --> 00:01:01,811
It was just playful mocking of the 
interview that she did with you because 

22
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,410
the interview was ridiculous.

23
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,650
It was a ridiculous interview.
I mean,

24
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,070
I listened to it or watched it several 
times.

25
00:01:07,071 --> 00:01:08,720
I was like,
this is so strange.

26
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,820
It's like her determination to turn it 
into a conflict to.

27
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:18,430
It's one of the issues that I have with 
television shows because they have a 

28
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:22,331
very limited amount of time and they're 
trying to make things as salacious as 

29
00:01:22,331 --> 00:01:22,730
possible.
They want to have these soundbites,

30
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:27,970
these clickbait sound soundbites and she
just went into it incredibly 

31
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:32,741
confrontational.
Not Trying to find your actual 

32
00:01:32,741 --> 00:01:34,790
perspective but trying to force you to 
defend a non non unrealistic

33
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:35,860
perspective.
Yes.

34
00:01:35,861 --> 00:01:40,861
While I was at,
I was the hypothetical villain of her 

35
00:01:40,861 --> 00:01:41,320
imagination essentially.
Well what happened?

36
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,350
What was interesting too,
the way it played itself out,

37
00:01:44,351 --> 00:01:47,110
because I met her in the greenroom 
beforehand,

38
00:01:47,111 --> 00:01:52,111
you know,
she was being made up and then they put 

39
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:53,821
a little bit of powder on me and we had 
a friendly kind of interchange and then 

40
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:55,090
we went and sat in front of the cameras 
for a couple of minutes before,

41
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:00,120
before the show got rolling and we had a
pretty pleasant back and forth and then 

42
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,421
as soon as the cameras went on,
she was a completely different person 

43
00:02:03,421 --> 00:02:03,421
and I thought,
oh,

44
00:02:03,421 --> 00:02:05,750
I see.
I see what's going on.

45
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,640
Yeah.
Well,

46
00:02:06,641 --> 00:02:09,250
so,
so that kind of alerted me to,

47
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,730
well the fact that there was something 
rotten in the state of Denmark,

48
00:02:12,731 --> 00:02:14,050
let's say.
Yeah,

49
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:19,051
but you know,
this is also why Youtube is going to 

50
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:20,200
kill tv because television by its 
nature,

51
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,520
all of these narrow broadcast 
technologies,

52
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,400
they re,
they rely on forcing the story,

53
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:27,730
right?

54
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:32,820
Because it has to happen now.
It has to happen in like often in five 

55
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,320
minutes because they only broadcast five
minutes of that interview.

56
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,300
They did put the whole thing up on 
youtube.

57
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,460
To their credit.
Yeah,

58
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:39,540
it,
it,

59
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:44,970
it hasn't ceased to amaze me yet.
I think that they thought that the 

60
00:02:45,071 --> 00:02:50,071
interview went fine.
So that's the Scuttlebutt I've got from 

61
00:02:50,071 --> 00:02:50,160
sort of behind the scenes because I've,
you know,

62
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:55,180
I know some people who know what's going
on at channel four and they're shell 

63
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,890
shocked by the response,
you know?

64
00:02:56,891 --> 00:03:01,891
And,
and then of course there is the counter 

65
00:03:01,891 --> 00:03:02,020
to the Guardian.
The next day published a paper,

66
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,720
published an article saying that,
you know,

67
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:09,130
the head of channel four had to call in 
police security because of threats,

68
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,360
you know.
Well,

69
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:15,390
first of all,
you can call the police and about 

70
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,780
anything and they never did detail out 
exactly what the threats were,

71
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:22,140
you know,
but then about 20 newspapers pick that 

72
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:22,140
up and went for the.
Well,

73
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:26,170
Kathy Newman is now I'm being harassed 
by an army of online trolls for doing 

74
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:26,890
nothing but doing her job,
which.

75
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:33,030
Well,
and then there was a backlash against 

76
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,030
that in the press.
So it's been a.

77
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,080
well,

78
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:39,690
when you say took an audit of the,
the actual interchanges between fans and

79
00:03:40,241 --> 00:03:43,030
her and there was way more negative ones
coming your way?

80
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,280
Yes.
That were seriously negative.

81
00:03:45,281 --> 00:03:46,840
Yeah.
That's seriously negative.

82
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,790
Violent,
harassing.

83
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,160
Just rude the way more.
Yep.

84
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,280
And no one picked up on that at all.
It has all the narrative was she's a 

85
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,840
victim even though she was highly 
aggressive,

86
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:03,340
but funny victim.
It's not like she's not successful.

87
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,390
At some point you think you should have 
to hand in your victim card.

88
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,850
I think like when you go to an ivy 
league university,

89
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:15,230
it's like right then and there you got 
it handy because you don't get to be 

90
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:15,460
oppressor and oppressed at the same 
time.

91
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,110
That's just too much.
Well,

92
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:22,140
one of the things that you pointed out 
was when you were talking about 

93
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,740
competition for very lucrative jobs and 
you were saying,

94
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,860
look what you've done like you,
you must have had to work here,

95
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:30,970
and she proudly was saying how hard she 
had to work to get there.

96
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:31,780
I'm like,
well yes,

97
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,220
of course.
No one's gonna hand this to,

98
00:04:33,221 --> 00:04:34,360
you know,
this is why,

99
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,860
and this is why you were saying you are 
opposed to equality of outcome.

100
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:44,550
They'll come,
I can't imagine anything we could 

101
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,311
possibly strive for in our society that 
would make it into hell faster than 

102
00:04:47,311 --> 00:04:49,690
equality of outcome.
Like the historical,

103
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,890
the historical evidence for the 
pathology of that root is so strong.

104
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,280
It's like you have to be historically 
ignorant beyond belief or malevolent or 

105
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:06,301
resentful beyond comprehension.
In order to think that that's a good 

106
00:05:06,301 --> 00:05:06,520
idea to argue for that.

107
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:11,610
I agree with you,
but I think that even if you came into 

108
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,790
this with no knowledge of history but a 
complete understanding of human beings,

109
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:13,720
you would say,
well,

110
00:05:13,721 --> 00:05:18,721
that doesn't make any sense and one of 
the best quotes that I've ever read 

111
00:05:18,721 --> 00:05:18,721
about it is that if you have real,
true freedom,

112
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,000
you're never going to have equality of 
outcome because with real,

113
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:24,610
true freedom,
you have the freedom to not conduct age.

114
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:25,480
Well,
look,

115
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:29,020
if you look at a guy like Jeff Bezos,
for instance at Amazon,

116
00:05:29,021 --> 00:05:30,820
guy was worth more money than anybody 
ever.

117
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,700
Right?
That guy works all day.

118
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,170
Yeah,
I mean he's a maniac,

119
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,680
acquiring all these different companies 
and everything he's doing is designed to

120
00:05:41,051 --> 00:05:42,100
succeed.
I mean,

121
00:05:42,101 --> 00:05:42,640
he's just

122
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,730
in a recent interview and I know some 
guys that are there in approximately the

123
00:05:48,731 --> 00:05:52,720
same universe as those two and they just
work all the time.

124
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,150
That's all they do and they don't just 
work.

125
00:05:55,151 --> 00:05:59,960
They work so efficiently and so 
effectively and make use of every second

126
00:05:59,961 --> 00:06:02,780
in ways you can't even imagine unless 
you're in that sort of position.

127
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:08,290
So you know,
doing that doesn't mean that you will 

128
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,170
succeed but not doing it certainly means
that you will fail,

129
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,330
you will use,
will not doing.

130
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:14,480
It certainly means you will never 
achieve that level of success.

131
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:17,180
And that's what we're talking about.
We're talking about equality of outcome.

132
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,270
I don't want that.
I don't want to be that guy.

133
00:06:20,271 --> 00:06:23,240
I don't want to work like that.
I don't want to do what he's doing and I

134
00:06:23,241 --> 00:06:28,241
should have the freedom to not do that 
as he should have the freedom to do 

135
00:06:28,241 --> 00:06:28,241
that.

136
00:06:28,241 --> 00:06:29,990
If we're going to play this game called 
capitalism,

137
00:06:29,991 --> 00:06:34,130
which we're all agreeing is probably,
at least in as far as the models that we

138
00:06:34,131 --> 00:06:35,780
have right now is the best one that we 
have.

139
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:40,810
If we're all going to play this game,
if someone decides to be the Michael 

140
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:41,060
Jordan of capitalism,
you can't stop them.

141
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,100
You can't say no,
no,

142
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:42,350
no,
no.

143
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:43,790
You're playing this game too.
Well,

144
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:46,640
you're playing this team too hard.
You're too obsessed with this game.

145
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,480
You're going to have that.
Yeah,

146
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:53,490
you can stop them.
You can try to stop people from winning 

147
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:53,960
crookedly yeah.
Which is what you should do and you know

148
00:06:53,961 --> 00:06:58,961
there's a couple of things that are 
really worth delving into with regards 

149
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:01,721
to that too because there's this sort of
Marxist notion that all this inequality 

150
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:05,831
is generated as a consequence of 
capitalism and now it's actually 

151
00:07:05,831 --> 00:07:06,860
technically false because if you look at
there's a.

152
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
There seems to be something like a law 
of nature that's described by this 

153
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,030
statistical model called Prieto 
distribution and it basically suggests 

154
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:21,251
that in any creative domain there's 
going to be a small number of people 

155
00:07:21,251 --> 00:07:22,850
will,
will do almost all of the output,

156
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,010
but it doesn't just apply to human 
beings.

157
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:29,480
It implies it applies to the heights of 
trees in the Amazon rain forest.

158
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,290
It applies to the size of cities and it 
applies to the massive stars,

159
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,260
which is something like the more you 
have,

160
00:07:36,261 --> 00:07:41,261
the more you get.
It's something you can imagine how that 

161
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,541
would work with his star.
As it gets bigger and bigger and its 

162
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,851
gravitational mass increases,
it's going to attract more and more 

163
00:07:45,851 --> 00:07:45,851
matter.
And then as the city grows,

164
00:07:45,851 --> 00:07:50,711
while more and more people are excited 
to move there because of all the 

165
00:07:50,711 --> 00:07:53,081
opportunities,
and so some cities start to grow 

166
00:07:53,081 --> 00:07:53,081
tremendously and others and others 
don't.

167
00:07:53,081 --> 00:07:54,470
But this,
this,

168
00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:00,430
this phenomena where a small number of 
people end up controlling a tremendous 

169
00:08:00,801 --> 00:08:05,801
proportion of the resource is not only 
limited to money and it doesn't only 

170
00:08:05,801 --> 00:08:07,160
occur in capitalist societies,
it occurs everywhere.

171
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:10,520
It's like a natural law.
So you see the same thing with number of

172
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,290
points scored by a,
you know,

173
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:17,291
a spectacular sports figure.
It was always a tiny proportion of 

174
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:20,861
people who are way,
way ahead way ahead on the curve or 

175
00:08:20,861 --> 00:08:24,311
people who make records or people who 
sell paintings or people who compose 

176
00:08:24,311 --> 00:08:25,940
music or people who sell music online.
It's all the same.

177
00:08:25,941 --> 00:08:29,690
It's,
it's the one percent gets 80 percent and

178
00:08:29,691 --> 00:08:34,691
so.
Well first we can't blame that on 

179
00:08:34,691 --> 00:08:36,881
capitalism.
And second we should note that it 

180
00:08:36,881 --> 00:08:39,881
actually does constitute a problem,
which is what the left wingers are 

181
00:08:39,881 --> 00:08:39,881
always jumping up and down about,
right?

182
00:08:39,881 --> 00:08:43,990
Too much inequality starts to 
destabilize your society and it isn't 

183
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,591
obvious how to shovel money from the top
and maybe the one 10th of one percent 

184
00:08:47,601 --> 00:08:52,601
who have almost all the money down to 
the people who have almost nothing in a 

185
00:08:52,601 --> 00:08:56,591
way that's effective so that they don't 
get thrown out of the game completely 

186
00:08:56,591 --> 00:08:57,420
and so that the whole society doesn't 
destabilize.

187
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:02,510
We don't exactly know how to do that.
It is a problem because inequality does 

188
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,720
exist and it does tend to magnify across
time.

189
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,990
And then there's another problem too,
which we haven't figured out,

190
00:09:06,991 --> 00:09:10,440
is imagine that in order to make 
everyone rich,

191
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,650
you have to tolerate a certain amount of
inequality.

192
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:18,830
That seems obvious.
We don't know how many units of 

193
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,370
inequality you need to tolerate per unit
of wealth generated,

194
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,940
but the answer is definitely not zero.
It's definitely not zero.

195
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:24,840
So

196
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:30,240
yeah,
so it goes back to this equality of 

197
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:30,240
outcome idea.
Yeah.

198
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,780
And this,
this thing has perplexed me since I've 

199
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:37,981
met you and since you were involved in 
this original debate over gender 

200
00:09:39,191 --> 00:09:44,191
pronouns,
and there was an article that was 

201
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,840
written recently,
I forget the exact title of it is,

202
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:49,890
I think it was something along the lines
of why can people hear what Jordan 

203
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,990
Peterson saying?
You are misrepresented more than anyone 

204
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:57,481
I know you know weird way.
You are villainized in a weird way where

205
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:03,060
I can't believe that these people are 
honestly looking at your opinions and 

206
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,760
coming up with these conclusions.
I I can't help but feel like what is 

207
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,081
happening is people are consciously 
deciding to ignore reality and paint you

208
00:10:15,251 --> 00:10:20,251
as this archetype will figure of 
oppressive white male patriarchy,

209
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:26,490
ignorance to fill in the blank with all 
the rest of the descriptives that you'd 

210
00:10:26,771 --> 00:10:30,010
like to use,
but they've decided to paint you in this

211
00:10:30,011 --> 00:10:34,870
way,
like as as a target because they need to

212
00:10:34,871 --> 00:10:39,871
target to sort of reinforce this idea 
that transgender people are being 

213
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:42,760
victimized and women are being 
victimized.

214
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,060
Yeah.
Well,

215
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:48,280
even deeper that the right narrative is 
the way that we should view the world is

216
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:53,460
victim versus oppressor because that's 
the basic postmodern new Marxists 

217
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:57,600
template.
It's the right way to view the world is 

218
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:57,600
that it's a power.
It's a power ground.

219
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,900
It's a battle ground of power,
interests competing constantly.

220
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,200
The ones that win are oppressors.
The ones that lose are press.

221
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,230
That's the way you look at the world and
I think that that's wrong.

222
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:11,350
That's a bad way of looking at the world
psychologically,

223
00:11:11,351 --> 00:11:12,700
sociologically,
politically,

224
00:11:12,701 --> 00:11:14,500
economically,
ideologically,

225
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,920
you name it.
It ends nothing but catastrophe.

226
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:23,130
I mean,
first of all because it puts your group 

227
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:23,130
identity as something that's paramount 
and I mean that's just not.

228
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,750
While that for that isn't what we do in 
the West.

229
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,800
Let's say we put your individual 
identity paramount and then.

230
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:34,000
Well that's just,
that's just for starters fundamentally.

231
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And then I guess the other reason that 
people are on my case to some degree is 

232
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,850
because I have made a strong case,
which I think is fully documented by the

233
00:11:42,851 --> 00:11:47,851
scientific literature that there are 
intrinsic differences say between men 

234
00:11:47,851 --> 00:11:47,980
and women.
And I think the evidence in that.

235
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:53,220
This is the thing that staggered me,
is that no serious scientists have that 

236
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:59,190
for like four decades.
It's that argument was done by the time 

237
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:02,380
I went to graduate school.
Everyone knew that human beings,

238
00:12:02,381 --> 00:12:05,680
we're not a blank slate.
That biological forces,

239
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:11,080
no parameterize the way that we thought 
and felt and acted in and and valued.

240
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:17,610
Everyone knew that the fact that this 
has become somehow debatable again is 

241
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:21,361
just,
especially because it's being done by 

242
00:12:21,361 --> 00:12:23,581
legislative Fiat,
they're forcing it to me as a scientist 

243
00:12:23,581 --> 00:12:23,581
is just,
it's just well.

244
00:12:23,581 --> 00:12:24,640
And in the states too,
with title,

245
00:12:24,641 --> 00:12:28,000
with title nine for example,
because title nine is sort of predicated

246
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:28,930
on that viewpoint.

247
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,200
What is title nine?
Title nine was originally just a piece 

248
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,021
of legislation that mandated that female
sports teams were funded to the same 

249
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:40,450
degree that male sports teams were 
funded in the American universities,

250
00:12:40,451 --> 00:12:45,451
but it's been expanded out so that if 
there's any differences in any areas 

251
00:12:45,451 --> 00:12:49,561
whatsoever between the genders than the 
universities are being taken to court 

252
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:53,580
and like $200 meeting last I looked 
about 200 of them more up and they can 

253
00:12:54,011 --> 00:12:56,830
have their funding revoked if they 
violate the title nine provisions,

254
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,740
so it's become like a vicious weapon for
social justice,

255
00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:04,741
Warrior,
equality of outcome types and so it's 

256
00:13:04,741 --> 00:13:06,350
not just about sports.
No,

257
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,440
it's got way,
way beyond that.

258
00:13:08,441 --> 00:13:08,840
Yeah,
it's,

259
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:13,860
it's,
it's become an equality of outcome 

260
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:13,860
issue.
Fundamentally.

261
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,950
There was an article that I sent you.

262
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:20,530
One of them was from,
I think I got it off of Digg.com,

263
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:24,970
but it was Jordan Peterson is having his
moment and we should ignore them.

264
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,160
I send this to and there was one part of
it.

265
00:13:27,161 --> 00:13:27,240
Probably

266
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:33,060
the last part of that might be true,
but one of the things in the article was

267
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,330
citing this study that showed very 
little different.

268
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:41,710
Oh God.
It's pathetic study.

269
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:46,880
Yeah.
I send it to you because I was like 

270
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:46,880
this.
This is not right.

271
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,710
Well,
the thing is like most things,

272
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,290
it's complicated.
Yes.

273
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:54,420
You know,
so our men and women more similar or 

274
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:54,420
more different.
Well,

275
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,530
it depends on how you define the terms 
first,

276
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,810
but they're more similar.
Well,

277
00:13:58,811 --> 00:13:59,350
why?
Well,

278
00:13:59,351 --> 00:14:02,800
they're the same species.
So we could start with that like,

279
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:08,430
but the question is what are the 
differences and how do they manifest 

280
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,250
themselves and are those manifestations 
important?

281
00:14:09,251 --> 00:14:14,251
So here's an example.
If you took a random woman out of the 

282
00:14:14,251 --> 00:14:19,081
population and a random matt and you had
to bet on who was more temperamentally 

283
00:14:19,081 --> 00:14:23,521
aggressive.
If you bet on the man you'd be right 60 

284
00:14:23,521 --> 00:14:26,731
percent of the time,
but you'd be wrong 40 percent of the 

285
00:14:26,731 --> 00:14:26,731
time.

286
00:14:26,731 --> 00:14:27,010
And that's not a walloping difference,
right?

287
00:14:27,011 --> 00:14:29,120
60 slash 40.
It's not 90 10.

288
00:14:29,121 --> 00:14:30,420
Like.
So there's quite,

289
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:35,430
there's a lot of overlap between men and
women in terms of their levels of 

290
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:35,430
aggression and you think,
well,

291
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,490
they're more of the same.
Yeah.

292
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:40,330
Except so then let's say no,
no,

293
00:14:40,331 --> 00:14:45,331
let's play a slightly different game.
Let's pick the one in 100 most 

294
00:14:45,331 --> 00:14:49,030
aggressive person from the random 
population while they're all men.

295
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,070
And that's why all the people in prison 
are men.

296
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,180
So even though on average men and women,
yeah,

297
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,410
it's 90,
90,

298
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,240
90 to 95 percent,
right?

299
00:14:59,241 --> 00:15:01,190
So,
and often if the women are in prison,

300
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:03,260
it's because they got tangled up with a 
really bad guy,

301
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:04,400
you know?
So.

302
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:10,030
So one of the problems is,
is that differences at the extreme are 

303
00:15:10,491 --> 00:15:13,160
where the differences really start to 
manifest themselves.

304
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,550
And so you can have a small difference 
at the level of the average.

305
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,870
But out at the extremes it starts to 
make a massive difference.

306
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:24,620
So let's say to be a google engineer,
which is hard,

307
00:15:24,621 --> 00:15:29,621
right?
Because not only you have to be an 

308
00:15:29,621 --> 00:15:29,621
engineer,
but you have to be a very good engineer,

309
00:15:29,621 --> 00:15:29,621
say,
well,

310
00:15:29,621 --> 00:15:32,360
you have to be interested in things 
rather than people.

311
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,490
That's,
that's a huge difference in interests.

312
00:15:34,491 --> 00:15:39,491
Like men are more interested in things 
generally speaking and women are more 

313
00:15:39,491 --> 00:15:40,730
interested in people generally speaking 
now.

314
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,320
There's still a lot of overlap between 
them,

315
00:15:42,321 --> 00:15:45,070
but that's one of the biggest 
differences between men and women.

316
00:15:45,071 --> 00:15:50,071
It's been demonstrated cross culturally.
It's also very big difference in the 

317
00:15:50,071 --> 00:15:50,071
Scandinavian countries.
Well,

318
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:56,050
on average,
the difference isn't that great even 

319
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:56,050
though it's a relatively large 
difference.

320
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:56,720
But at the extremes,
it's the same thing.

321
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,840
Almost all the people that are hyper,
um,

322
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,960
what would you call hyperfocused on 
things?

323
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:08,080
They're almost all men and all the 
people who are hyperfocused on people 

324
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,980
are almost all women.
And so how does that play out in the 

325
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:11,980
world?
Well,

326
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,020
in the Scandinavian countries,
it plays out this way,

327
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:17,710
but 85 percent of nurses in Scandinavia 
are female and about 85 to 90 percent of

328
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:23,111
engineers are male.
It doesn't mean women can't be 

329
00:16:23,111 --> 00:16:23,420
engineers.
It doesn't mean men can't be nurses.

330
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:26,030
It also doesn't have anything to do with
intelligence,

331
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:31,810
but it does have to do with interest and
the differences in interest are big now 

332
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:35,210
at the extremes in particular.
So when you read a review like that,

333
00:16:35,211 --> 00:16:36,980
the one that was pointed out,
the first question is,

334
00:16:36,981 --> 00:16:39,890
well,
what do you mean by big and little?

335
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:45,400
There's more overlap.
There's more overlap between men and 

336
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:45,560
women than there is difference on 
virtually every parameter.

337
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:46,400
Okay,
fine.

338
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Are the remaining differences 
significant in how they play out in the 

339
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,240
world or the answer to that is 
overwhelmingly significant because you,

340
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,100
you,
you select for extremes.

341
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
So here's another example.
Ashkenazi Jews have an average Iq of 

342
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,650
115.
So in the typical population overall has

343
00:17:03,651 --> 00:17:08,651
an average Iq of 100.
15 points is about the difference 

344
00:17:08,651 --> 00:17:10,100
between the typical college student and 
the typical high school student.

345
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:13,010
Okay?
So it's not a massive difference,

346
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:18,310
but if you go to the extreme say,
well let's go look at people who only 

347
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:21,521
have an Iq of 145,
which is kind of where you hit the 

348
00:17:21,521 --> 00:17:24,821
beginnings of genius level.
So like the Jews are overwhelmingly 

349
00:17:24,821 --> 00:17:28,001
overrepresented,
so relatively small differences in the 

350
00:17:28,431 --> 00:17:33,431
average can produce walloping 
differences at the extremes and people 

351
00:17:33,431 --> 00:17:36,941
don't understand that it's not 
surprising because it actually requires 

352
00:17:36,941 --> 00:17:37,850
a fairly sophisticated grasp of 
statistics,

353
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:42,110
but when we're talking about things like
differential outcome in the workplace,

354
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:47,840
um,
then you have to take a sophisticated 

355
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,080
statistical approach to it or you don't 
know what the hell you're talking about.

356
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:53,110
And unfortunately many of the people who
are talking about things like gender 

357
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:56,691
differences,
they have no idea what they're talking 

358
00:17:56,691 --> 00:17:56,691
about.
They don't know the literature,

359
00:17:56,691 --> 00:17:57,690
they don't know there is a literature,
they don't understand biology,

360
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:01,920
like the social constructionist types,
the women's studies types,

361
00:18:01,921 --> 00:18:04,380
the Neo Marxists,
they don't give a damn about biology.

362
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:07,410
It's like they inhabit some disembodied 
universe.

363
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:12,510
So the review was poorly written at best
and did not,

364
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:18,070
was showed it a very poor grasp of the 
relationship between group differences 

365
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,460
and economic and practical outcomes.

366
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,770
It's not just that it's deceptive and 
there's,

367
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:28,800
there's a need in some way on that side,
this side of the debate,

368
00:18:29,811 --> 00:18:34,811
the Anti Jordan Peterson side to label 
men and women as being virtually 

369
00:18:36,441 --> 00:18:40,460
identical when there's so much evidence 
that that's not the case.

370
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,520
And what your saying?
Well you've,

371
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:46,400
you've never said one is superior,
one is inferior.

372
00:18:46,401 --> 00:18:51,401
What you are is a guy who's pointing out
the reality of the difference between 

373
00:18:51,401 --> 00:18:55,280
the various types of human beings and 
you've been very open about the extremes

374
00:18:55,281 --> 00:18:56,260
about,
look,

375
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,000
I'm,
I'm well aware of the extremes.

376
00:18:58,001 --> 00:19:03,001
I deal with MMA fighters.
I know a lot of female mma fighters are 

377
00:19:03,001 --> 00:19:06,650
as aggressive and as tough as any man 
you're ever going to meet in your life.

378
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:11,950
And I know a lot of men from comedy that
are meek little guys who they're not 

379
00:19:12,021 --> 00:19:14,390
nearly as aggressive as some of these 
female fighters.

380
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:19,390
Like there's.
I think one of the beautiful things 

381
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:22,391
about freedom is that people get an 
opportunity to express themselves in a 

382
00:19:22,401 --> 00:19:27,350
way that genuinely them and whether that
is like our friend Alex honnold,

383
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:32,380
who's a free climber who was like 
climbing up these fantastic mountains 

384
00:19:32,721 --> 00:19:37,470
with no ropes or whether it's a female 
mma fighter like Raquel Pennington,

385
00:19:37,471 --> 00:19:42,471
it was just a tank and beating the shit 
out of people and that's what she loves 

386
00:19:42,471 --> 00:19:46,661
to do.
All of these extremes are available to 

387
00:19:46,661 --> 00:19:48,580
people because of freedom.
This is not a suppressive thing.

388
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,260
No one's stopping people from choosing 
these paths.

389
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:56,060
I don't know if you saw the most recent 
slipup by the CEO of Youtube.

390
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,040
Um,
I retweeted it today.

391
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:03,230
Um,
they were talking about why there's not 

392
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:06,770
as many women in tech.
And she basically said they,

393
00:20:06,771 --> 00:20:11,771
both her and the CEO of Google said 
exactly what James Damore was saying in 

394
00:20:11,771 --> 00:20:14,420
his memo.
They completely fucked up.

395
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,990
They tried to find this.
Look at this.

396
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,560
This is Goddamn hilarious.
And James Demore had this on his page.

397
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:24,590
They respond to women.
A lack of tech goes.

398
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:26,990
Could you know,
go to go to James Damore tweet.

399
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,310
Just go to the,
the what I retweeted and what he said.

400
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,250
So there was a study published a while 
ago or

401
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:35,440
no?
Jamie,

402
00:20:35,441 --> 00:20:36,660
scroll back up.
It was right there.

403
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:38,970
It's right there.
Just just make his tweet larger.

404
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,350
There you go.
Let's it.

405
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,150
He's saying,
did I read this right?

406
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,650
I don't know how to say her name is.
Susan would have.

407
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,890
Sorry,
I don't know how to say her name.

408
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,380
W A W O

409
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,400
J I c I c k.
I said that women find Geeky male 

410
00:20:53,651 --> 00:20:57,820
industries as opposed to social 
industry's not very interesting.

411
00:20:57,821 --> 00:21:00,880
And Sundar cites research on gender 
differences.

412
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,490
That's exactly the difference in 
interest that I just pointed out.

413
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,520
That's exactly right.
This is what James Damore wrote in his 

414
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,090
memo that got him fired.
And this in my mind,

415
00:21:10,091 --> 00:21:12,190
if I was the lawyer for James Demore and
be like,

416
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,870
oh,
well look what we have here.

417
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,520
This is,
this is checkmate.

418
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:19,720
You dummies just at the divorce story is
really interesting,

419
00:21:19,721 --> 00:21:24,721
you know,
because I think it's such a classic 

420
00:21:24,721 --> 00:21:26,641
story of,
of an engineer getting tangled up in 

421
00:21:26,641 --> 00:21:27,910
politics.
So demora went to this diversity seminar

422
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,420
and he wasn't very happy about it 
because he knew the literature and so at

423
00:21:31,421 --> 00:21:33,760
the end of the seminar they asked for 
feedback,

424
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,980
well James Morris,
an engineer,

425
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:39,820
so when you tell an engineer that you 
want feedback,

426
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,170
the engineer thinks,
oh,

427
00:21:41,171 --> 00:21:45,340
you want feedback and the and you want 
like facts and stuff,

428
00:21:45,341 --> 00:21:45,640
right?

429
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,080
Because that's what feedback would be 
like.

430
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:50,020
So demora went and wrote this like 
thoreau memo and gave it to them.

431
00:21:50,021 --> 00:21:50,470
He said,
well,

432
00:21:50,471 --> 00:21:52,150
you know,
this is what I think,

433
00:21:52,151 --> 00:21:55,930
here's some feedback.
And then it traveled around the.

434
00:21:55,931 --> 00:22:00,931
He got no real response from the 
diversity of people and then he posted 

435
00:22:00,931 --> 00:22:02,470
it on one of these internal boards at 
Google where people can discuss things,

436
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:07,530
which people at Google do all the time.
So it was perfectly reasonable for him 

437
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:08,620
to post it because he didn't get a 
response from the diversity people.

438
00:22:08,621 --> 00:22:09,220
He thought,
well,

439
00:22:09,221 --> 00:22:14,221
let's see what other people think.
And then it was there for a long time 

440
00:22:14,221 --> 00:22:15,160
until it was leaked out into the outside
world.

441
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:19,360
It wasn't like Demora was trying to 
expose Google for for what it is.

442
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,600
He was just doing what an engineer type 
would do when someone asked him to 

443
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,070
provide feedback because he's not 
thinking politically.

444
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:27,940
He's not thinking,
oh,

445
00:22:27,941 --> 00:22:30,280
they just want to hear what they already
said.

446
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:33,520
He thought they actually wanted some 
facts anyways.

447
00:22:33,521 --> 00:22:38,521
I think they picked on the wrong guy 
because it turns out to be pretty damn 

448
00:22:38,521 --> 00:22:40,330
tough.
But he's very smart and a very kind guy.

449
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:43,090
When you sit down and talk to him,
he's not a sexist.

450
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:45,520
He's a.
he's a guy that's talking about facts.

451
00:22:45,521 --> 00:22:48,310
In fact,
he wrote more than a page and a half,

452
00:22:48,311 --> 00:22:53,311
I believe on strategies for getting more
women interested in tech.

453
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:58,390
He's not a sexist.
This is just a guy that was talking 

454
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,680
about the differences in the choices 
that people make that it's based on just

455
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,800
the variations that you were just 
discussing.

456
00:23:01,801 --> 00:23:03,700
Well there,
there's a good study done awhile ago and

457
00:23:03,701 --> 00:23:08,701
unfortunately to remember the author,
but they were looking at junior high 

458
00:23:08,701 --> 00:23:12,481
math prodigies and they're pretty 
equally distributed between boys and 

459
00:23:12,481 --> 00:23:14,410
girls,
but by the time university came along,

460
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,890
they math prodigy boys,
they tend to go into the stem fields but

461
00:23:17,891 --> 00:23:20,590
the girls wouldn't and it doesn't 
because they lacked ability because they

462
00:23:20,591 --> 00:23:21,670
had stellar ability.

463
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:26,880
It's because they weren't interested and
it turns out like the interesting turns 

464
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,540
out to be a big one.
So with personality alone,

465
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:33,541
if you measure men and women's 
personalities and then you add up all 

466
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:36,571
the differences in personalities,
you could tell with about 75 to 80 

467
00:23:36,571 --> 00:23:39,880
percent certainty by looking at a full 
personality readout whether persons male

468
00:23:39,881 --> 00:23:44,881
or female.
So you'd be wrong 25 percent of the 

469
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:44,881
time,
something like that.

470
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,580
But if you add interest to that,
you can get it up to about 90 percent.

471
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,230
And so you know,
you say,

472
00:23:48,231 --> 00:23:50,360
well,
are these differences large?

473
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:53,270
Well,
individually they're not that big.

474
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,420
They make more difference at the 
extremes,

475
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:01,610
but if you add them up then you can 
almost completely differentiate men from

476
00:24:01,611 --> 00:24:03,770
women.
So by that token there,

477
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:08,810
they're very large and the interesting 
actually turns out to matter a lot like 

478
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:12,071
it's probably the most important 
individual difference that has been 

479
00:24:12,071 --> 00:24:14,651
discovered between men and women at the 
psychological level and has real decent 

480
00:24:14,651 --> 00:24:18,341
explanatory power because you might say,
well men have a slight edge and spatial 

481
00:24:18,341 --> 00:24:22,070
intelligence and that's why they're 
overrepresented in stem fields and women

482
00:24:22,071 --> 00:24:23,690
have a slight edge and verbal 
intelligence.

483
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:28,780
This is debatable,
but literature kind of indicates that 

484
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:31,391
and that's why they're overwhelmingly 
the majority of fiction readers for 

485
00:24:31,391 --> 00:24:35,261
example,
is that the reason that there's 

486
00:24:35,261 --> 00:24:35,330
differential representation in the stem 
fields,

487
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:35,900
it's like,
no,

488
00:24:35,901 --> 00:24:40,901
it doesn't seem to be.
It doesn't look like it's an 

489
00:24:40,901 --> 00:24:40,901
intellectual issue,
which is also what the more pointed out.

490
00:24:40,901 --> 00:24:45,070
By the way,
he never said once that this was a 

491
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:45,320
cognitive issue,
but it's a matter of choice.

492
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:50,510
Matter of interest and women tend to be 
more more people oriented.

493
00:24:50,511 --> 00:24:55,511
Now the thing is,
this has also been discovered in 

494
00:24:55,511 --> 00:24:58,301
chimpanzees and other primates.
Like if you offer baby or child 

495
00:24:59,091 --> 00:25:00,980
chimpanzees,
juvenile chimpanzees,

496
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,400
the toys choice between thing,
like toys,

497
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:07,280
like cars or people like toys,
like dolls,

498
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,520
the males will go for the thing like 
toys and the females would go for the 

499
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,581
people like toys.
So you see that in primates and you 

500
00:25:15,581 --> 00:25:15,581
think,
well he's not surprising.

501
00:25:15,581 --> 00:25:15,740
It's like,
well no it's not.

502
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:20,210
It's not that surprising really mean 
women have to take care of infants,

503
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:25,570
tiny infants and you have to be really 
people oriented to do that because a 

504
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:29,801
tiny infant isn't unbelievably demanding
social relationship and it's a primary 

505
00:25:30,741 --> 00:25:33,320
relationship for about two years,
you know?

506
00:25:33,321 --> 00:25:38,321
And so women are tilted towards the kind
of temperament that makes that possible.

507
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,140
It's like,
well,

508
00:25:39,141 --> 00:25:42,050
it's not such a shock really.
That's such a surprise.

509
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,550
So no,

510
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,000
it's not a surprise in what.
What's confusing to me is the narrative 

511
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,760
that anybody that points out these 
differences is somehow a sexist or 

512
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,450
discriminatory or.

513
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,520
Yeah.
Yeah.

514
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,490
Well,
whatever epithet can.

515
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:04,530
Well,
I think the other reason that the left 

516
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:05,020
the radical lefties have been going 
after me constantly as well.

517
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:08,980
There's one reason is if you stand up 
against the radical radical left,

518
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:14,400
you're in a group that also has Nazis in
it because the Nazis also stand up 

519
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,961
against the radical left,
so it's perfectly reasonable from a 

520
00:26:18,961 --> 00:26:20,470
strategic perspective for the radical 
leftists who say,

521
00:26:20,471 --> 00:26:21,790
well,
you're against us.

522
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,890
How do we know where you're not a Nazi?
It's like,

523
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,000
well,
statistically,

524
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,550
statistically I'm probably not,
you know,

525
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,590
so there's that.
But,

526
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,880
but you could say at least the question 
is open,

527
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:31,900
but,
but,

528
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:37,380
but then the next part of it comes is 
that it's motivated epithet slinging,

529
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:42,870
because if I'm reasonable and I'm 
standing up against the radical left and

530
00:26:43,831 --> 00:26:48,831
they admit that I'm reasonable,
then there has to be an admission that 

531
00:26:48,831 --> 00:26:50,730
reasonable people could stand up against
the radical left,

532
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:54,060
which kind of implies that the radical 
left isn't that reasonable.

533
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,710
And so while they're not going to go 
there,

534
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:59,250
of course they're not out reasonable or 
unreasonable beyond belief.

535
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:02,340
As we saw in a situation with Lindsay 
Shepherd in Canada.

536
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:07,850
So at Wilfrid laurier university.
Talk about that real quick because that 

537
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:09,630
was a fascinating thing to.
And that also had to do with you,

538
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,960
so she was discussing you in class and 
he'd fill up on everybody.

539
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:20,930
She's in communications in the 
communications department at Wilfrid 

540
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:24,500
Laurier,
and they were talking about the role of 

541
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:29,331
language and communication,
which kind of what you would do in a 

542
00:27:29,331 --> 00:27:31,971
communication class.
And she decided to show a five minute 

543
00:27:31,971 --> 00:27:34,080
clip from a program I had done for TV 
Ontario,

544
00:27:34,081 --> 00:27:36,510
which is a public television station,
mainstream,

545
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:41,190
left leaning Liberal television station 
news program and a good one,

546
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:44,970
a good one.
And I had been on there with a number of

547
00:27:44,971 --> 00:27:47,340
other people,
including a professor Nicolas,

548
00:27:47,341 --> 00:27:52,341
Matt from the University of Toronto who 
claimed essentially that there were no 

549
00:27:52,341 --> 00:27:52,341
biological differences between men and 
women.

550
00:27:52,341 --> 00:27:55,080
And that had been the scientific 
consensus for the last four decades.

551
00:27:55,350 --> 00:28:00,270
So anyways,
she showed a clip from this and well she

552
00:28:00,271 --> 00:28:04,350
got hauled in front of two professors,
ended administrator,

553
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,170
Adrian Joel,
who was basically hired for that purpose

554
00:28:07,171 --> 00:28:11,010
and raked over the coals for daring to 
show this video.

555
00:28:11,011 --> 00:28:16,011
And she had the wherewithal to tape it.
And then she made the tape public.

556
00:28:17,101 --> 00:28:18,690
And in that tape they compared me,
it was,

557
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,620
it was really blackley comical,
you know,

558
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:24,480
they compared me to Hitler and,
but then said,

559
00:28:24,481 --> 00:28:26,310
well,
it's Hitler or Milo Yiannopoulos.

560
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:28,200
I thought you guys just so damn 
clueless.

561
00:28:28,201 --> 00:28:33,201
He can't even get your insults right.
It's like he can't say that's like 

562
00:28:33,201 --> 00:28:35,640
playing a video of Hitler or Milo 
Yiannopoulos.

563
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:36,660
It's like,
first of all,

564
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,200
Hitler and Milo Yiannopoulos,
they're actually not in the same 

565
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:42,200
category,
right?

566
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:46,340
Except that they're both human.
That's about the narrowness of the 

567
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:46,340
category.

568
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:51,230
And then Milo's a,
like a comic provocateur and you can 

569
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,280
hate him or love him or,
or be indifferent,

570
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:58,610
but to put them in the same category as 
Hitler just shows how muddle headed you 

571
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:02,901
are.
And then to assimilate me to that 

572
00:29:02,901 --> 00:29:05,001
category.
So carelessly like you don't mess about 

573
00:29:05,001 --> 00:29:09,111
with epithets like that.
Know Hitler was one of the Great Super 

574
00:29:09,111 --> 00:29:09,660
Villains of the 20th century.
Right?

575
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:10,740
I mean,
he was,

576
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,970
he's up there with Stalin and Mao in 
the,

577
00:29:12,971 --> 00:29:17,971
in the,
in the panoply of Satanic Lee possessed 

578
00:29:17,971 --> 00:29:17,971
leaders.
You don't just toss that around,

579
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:23,540
especially not when you're torturing 
your teaching assistant for daring to 

580
00:29:23,581 --> 00:29:28,140
show a video about language in a 
communication class,

581
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,980
and so that was a massive scandal in 
Canada was the biggest skill.

582
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:37,010
I think it was the biggest scandal that 
ever hit a university in Canada and it 

583
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:38,070
got a lot of international attention and
rightly so,

584
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,350
and she also turns out to be a tough 
cookie.

585
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,070
I mean,
the last I heard she was,

586
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:47,460
she'd started a club at Wilford laurier 
and I think it was last night or the 

587
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,010
night before,
maybe it's coming up.

588
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:53,190
They're going to show the whole video 
from Television Ontario at a club 

589
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:55,090
meeting and invite people to come and 
discuss it.

590
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:57,940
It's like they.
They picked on the wrong girl there too,

591
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:00,190
so there's certainly didn't choose.
Obviously very smart.

592
00:30:00,191 --> 00:30:05,191
You can hear that in her discussion with
them and how flabbergasted she was by 

593
00:30:05,191 --> 00:30:08,941
their take on things,
but this was essentially proof to a lot 

594
00:30:08,941 --> 00:30:13,261
of people that were on the outside of 
how preposterous some of the dialogue 

595
00:30:13,261 --> 00:30:17,670
was inside these universities and they 
couldn't have done me a bigger favor 

596
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:20,410
than having that scandal because when I 
made the videos about bill see 16,

597
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,270
15 months ago,
I said,

598
00:30:22,271 --> 00:30:27,271
look,
here's what's going to happen because 

599
00:30:27,271 --> 00:30:28,891
this legislation is written in an 
appalling manner and the surrounding 

600
00:30:28,891 --> 00:30:29,470
policies are pathological.

601
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,760
Said,
here's what's going to happen,

602
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:33,700
and so I laid it out and then people 
came out and said,

603
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,260
no,
you're being paranoid.

604
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:36,460
It's like,
that's possible.

605
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,480
No,
the bill,

606
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:39,550
the legislation isn't going to have that
effect.

607
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:41,020
No,
you're not a legal expert.

608
00:30:41,021 --> 00:30:42,520
What the hell do you know?
Et Cetera,

609
00:30:42,521 --> 00:30:43,630
et cetera.
You're crazy.

610
00:30:43,631 --> 00:30:45,180
You're a bigot.
You're a transformed.

611
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,220
You know,
they,

612
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:49,150
they threw everything but the kitchen 
sink at me and like,

613
00:30:49,151 --> 00:30:49,990
fair enough,
you know,

614
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:52,090
because there's always the possibility 
that I was wrong.

615
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,480
But the problem was is I read the 
policies and I understood them and I 

616
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,931
knew where they were leading,
but I never imagined that one of the 

617
00:31:00,931 --> 00:31:04,711
consequences of bill [inaudible] and its
sister legislation was that a teaching 

618
00:31:04,711 --> 00:31:07,810
assistant at a Canadian university would
be pilloried and accused of breaking the

619
00:31:07,811 --> 00:31:12,811
law and then accused of all sorts of 
reprehensible political beliefs by two 

620
00:31:12,811 --> 00:31:14,740
professors and an administrator hired 
for that purpose.

621
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:20,160
I'm merely because she showed a video 
about two people talking about the law.

622
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:23,920
It's like that,
that paranoid as I am,

623
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:29,040
let's say that that exceeded the grasp 
or the reach of my imagination.

624
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,110
And then of course it was made public 
and people just couldn't believe it.

625
00:31:32,111 --> 00:31:33,280
And then you think,
okay,

626
00:31:33,281 --> 00:31:35,170
well what's the defense?
Well,

627
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:37,820
they misinterpreted bill [inaudible].
So like,

628
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,430
no,
I don't think so.

629
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:45,250
Um,
they aren't representative of the 

630
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:45,790
university professor at administration.
Well,

631
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:50,020
all of pim lot and rambo kindness 
colleagues rose to their defense,

632
00:31:50,021 --> 00:31:52,060
the whole department,
the university,

633
00:31:52,061 --> 00:31:54,850
when they apologized,
did it in a very mealy mouth way.

634
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:58,360
Like there's no evidence that it was an 
anomalous occurrence.

635
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:03,150
So what had happened is they 
overextended the reach of bill,

636
00:32:03,151 --> 00:32:05,830
see 16 in exactly the way that I said 
would happen.

637
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:09,280
It was inevitable and it wasn't an 
anomaly.

638
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,180
It was actually.

639
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:15,210
That's actually the way that the 
universities are and it is the way that 

640
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:15,340
they are.
It wasn't a one off,

641
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,520
it was exactly diagnostic and it's 
appalling.

642
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:24,180
It's appalling.
The universities have so much to be 

643
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,090
ashamed of their their there.
While there was an article in the Boston

644
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:30,090
Globe this week saying the same thing,
that all of this crazy postmodern 

645
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:34,030
identity politics,
equality of outcome nonsense is not only

646
00:32:34,031 --> 00:32:39,031
disrupted the university in a way that 
might be irreparable as far as I can 

647
00:32:39,031 --> 00:32:43,801
tell,
but it's rapidly spreading outside into 

648
00:32:43,801 --> 00:32:46,100
the normal say business world,
which was exactly what you see.

649
00:32:46,101 --> 00:32:47,150
For example,
at Google.

650
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:52,630
Well the tech industry in particular 
seems to be more left leaning than 

651
00:32:52,761 --> 00:32:57,761
pretty much any industry there is and I 
guess it's because there's so many 

652
00:32:57,761 --> 00:33:00,791
intelligent people.
There are so many people that has spent 

653
00:33:00,791 --> 00:33:03,371
a tremendous amount of time in 
universities and they get indoctrinated 

654
00:33:03,371 --> 00:33:05,210
into this mindset and you're.
You're seeing that in this,

655
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:10,780
the CEO of youtubes response to the 
James Damore memo completely 

656
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,250
misrepresented it to the other talking 
about harmful gender stereotypes.

657
00:33:13,251 --> 00:33:18,251
That's not what he talked about at all.
What what's fascinating to me about all 

658
00:33:18,251 --> 00:33:23,141
of this is it,
it just reeks of tribalism that these 

659
00:33:23,781 --> 00:33:26,570
people on the left have decided.
I mean,

660
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:30,170
and I'm mostly on the left,
which is really crazy.

661
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:35,740
I mean when it comes to most policies 
and most thoughts of equality and and 

662
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:38,960
the idea of just letting people be who 
they are.

663
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:41,750
I mean that's what the left used to 
stand for,

664
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:46,810
do use to stand for being open minded,
and he used to stand for being a 

665
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:46,810
reasonable person.

666
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:52,080
It now it seems to be all about this 
very toxic tribal ideology and this is 

667
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:58,670
one of the reasons why so many of these 
attacks and you are so baffling to me as

668
00:33:58,671 --> 00:34:03,410
because there's a willful ignorance or a
deceptive narrative there.

669
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:08,430
There's a deceptive description of who 
you are and what you're saying and what 

670
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:11,360
you represent,
and it's this conveniently categorize,

671
00:34:11,361 --> 00:34:13,500
not even convenient,
willfully ignore,

672
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:17,210
willfully deceptively categorized into 
these categories,

673
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:20,420
categories of homophobia,
transphobia,

674
00:34:20,421 --> 00:34:25,421
sexism.
These are reprehensible categories that 

675
00:34:25,421 --> 00:34:26,600
if they can just shove something that 
you're saying,

676
00:34:26,601 --> 00:34:31,220
figuring out a way to push you into this
little narrow confined than how everyone

677
00:34:31,221 --> 00:34:35,870
has to disagree with you.
Everyone has to insult you in.

678
00:34:35,871 --> 00:34:40,871
Everyone has to take that girl into 
their office and chastise you for even.

679
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:45,050
You're not even speaking up for you.

680
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:47,290
Right?
She said she wasn't.

681
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:52,380
Yes.
That's what was more fascinating about 

682
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:52,380
it than anything.
Then they give her hell for that.

683
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:57,190
Like all.
You can't present something like that 

684
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:59,011
neutrally.
That's like presenting something Hitler 

685
00:34:59,011 --> 00:34:59,011
said neutrally or maybe Milo 
Yiannopoulos.

686
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:01,250
It's.
It's so strange,

687
00:35:01,251 --> 00:35:03,830
but what they don't understand,
and this is what's really crazy,

688
00:35:03,831 --> 00:35:08,540
is that the world is watching and that 
most people,

689
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:14,260
maybe it's a 60 slash 40 like we were 
talking about before when it comes to 

690
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,120
aggressive women versus aggressive men.
I don't know what the number.

691
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,540
I think it's almost 50 to one,
actually my.

692
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:22,280
I've been watching the comments on 
youtube and so forth,

693
00:35:22,281 --> 00:35:27,281
trying to track this is like I think 
that like I think that what the radical 

694
00:35:27,501 --> 00:35:32,501
leftists are doing is overwhelmingly 
unrepresentative of the general 

695
00:35:33,351 --> 00:35:35,780
population overwhelmingly,
but they're.

696
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:41,020
They're a very well organized and and 
verbal and prepared minority and they've

697
00:35:43,621 --> 00:35:47,250
occupied powerful positions in many,
many institutions.

698
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:52,310
Hr and one of the things I really can't 
figure out right now and for anybody 

699
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:54,060
who's running a company that's 
listening,

700
00:35:54,061 --> 00:35:59,061
they should think this through,
like to let these postmodern Neo 

701
00:35:59,061 --> 00:36:02,990
Marxists into your company through the 
guise of human resources is an absolute 

702
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:02,990
catastrophe.
You're going to pay for that.

703
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:06,780
This ideology that drives postmodern,
neo Marxism,

704
00:36:06,781 --> 00:36:11,781
this identity politics,
what the identity politics movement and 

705
00:36:13,081 --> 00:36:17,490
its insistence on equality of outcome is
a powerfully anticapitalistic.

706
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,120
It's powerfully anti-western.
Why you would let that into your company

707
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,790
is so that you can look good.
Socially,

708
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:26,230
let's say is beyond me.
It's a big mistake.

709
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:31,290
I agree with you,
but I don't think people are aware of 

710
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:33,451
it.
I think part of the problem is this 

711
00:36:33,451 --> 00:36:34,090
battleground is largely ignored by the 
general population.

712
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:36,220
I don't think most people are aware of 
what's going on.

713
00:36:36,221 --> 00:36:41,221
You are,
because you're obviously you're deeply 

714
00:36:41,221 --> 00:36:42,270
embedded in the university system in 
Canada and you're.

715
00:36:42,271 --> 00:36:47,271
You're obviously now branching out into 
youtube and podcasts and all these 

716
00:36:47,801 --> 00:36:49,780
different ways to get this information 
out,

717
00:36:49,781 --> 00:36:53,390
but the average person that is a ceo of 
a company or they're.

718
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,060
They're concerned with their own 
company,

719
00:36:55,061 --> 00:36:57,340
they're concerned with their own 
individual needs,

720
00:36:57,341 --> 00:37:00,940
their concern with organizing things and
keeping their bottom line

721
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,410
well.
They're also concerned with looking fair

722
00:37:03,411 --> 00:37:06,230
and making sure that they're not 
prejudice and all of that,

723
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:09,860
which is laudable and.
But I just don't think they see the wave

724
00:37:09,861 --> 00:37:10,700
coming now.
They don't.

725
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:15,760
They don't see it coming.
They don't understand it and they're in 

726
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:15,760
conscious about it,
but they're going to pay for it.

727
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,411
Well,
Google is a good example because now 

728
00:37:20,411 --> 00:37:22,091
google is in court on the feminist end 
for like being prejudiced against 

729
00:37:22,091 --> 00:37:26,831
females and also on the conservative end
for being prejudice against 

730
00:37:26,831 --> 00:37:26,831
conservatives.
It's like,

731
00:37:26,831 --> 00:37:28,610
well,
so both camps or after the men.

732
00:37:28,611 --> 00:37:29,000
I think,
well,

733
00:37:29,001 --> 00:37:29,780
why is that?
It's like,

734
00:37:29,781 --> 00:37:34,781
well,
that's what happens when you play 

735
00:37:34,781 --> 00:37:35,771
identity politics.
This tribalism or this is really what I 

736
00:37:35,771 --> 00:37:39,071
can't stand about,
identity politics and I've been warning 

737
00:37:39,071 --> 00:37:40,610
about the consequences of on the right 
wing too because what I see happening is

738
00:37:40,611 --> 00:37:45,611
that as the left,
like let's say the left gets to define 

739
00:37:45,611 --> 00:37:49,331
the linguistic territory,
which was what I was objecting to and 

740
00:37:49,331 --> 00:37:49,331
bill [inaudible] when it came out,
I said,

741
00:37:49,331 --> 00:37:53,921
look,
I'm not going to use these neologisms z 

742
00:37:53,921 --> 00:37:55,880
and etc.
Because as far as I'm concerned,

743
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:56,570
they have nothing.

744
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:01,840
Don't know what you're talking aBout.
Different made up gender pronouns to 

745
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:04,870
describe people in the non male or 
female.

746
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,000
That's right.
So there's like 70 different categories 

747
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,731
of non binary gender or something like 
that generated now and there's lists of 

748
00:38:12,731 --> 00:38:16,751
pronouns that hypothetically the people 
who are in those categories can choose 

749
00:38:16,751 --> 00:38:21,611
to be addressed by and now that has the 
force of law and so and I don't care if 

750
00:38:22,641 --> 00:38:24,730
they choose to be addressed by those 
pronouns,

751
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,760
whatever.
That's,

752
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:26,840
that's,
that's,

753
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:32,020
that's up to them and whoever else they 
can convInce or ask or in treat or 

754
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:32,480
negotiate with,
fine.

755
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,910
As soon as it's law,
that's a whole different.

756
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,680
Okay,
so now I have to use a certain 

757
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,361
terminology.
So then I look at the derivation of the 

758
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:42,361
terminology.
I say,

759
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:45,840
oh,
that's terminology generated by the 

760
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:45,840
postmodern neo marxists.
Oh,

761
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,340
well I think those people are 
reprehensible,

762
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,940
murderous.
So guess what?

763
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:52,570
I'm not going to say their words period,
because I know what they're like.

764
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,520
I know where that leads.
Okay,

765
00:38:54,521 --> 00:38:54,780
so

766
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:58,030
bumps on.
Most people think that that's a gigantic

767
00:38:58,031 --> 00:39:03,031
step to go from saying you don't want to
say z or z or any of these made up 

768
00:39:03,251 --> 00:39:06,010
gender pronouns too.
These are murderous people.

769
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:09,640
The ideology is murderous.
The edlp being marxism.

770
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:10,510
Yeah,
absolutely.

771
00:39:10,511 --> 00:39:12,340
Well jesus,
how much proof do you need?

772
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:16,270
But most people don't understand 
marxism.

773
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,620
Like when you,
when you're saying this,

774
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:22,621
like when you were so adamant about it,
I had to start reading about it myself 

775
00:39:22,621 --> 00:39:26,701
and I had started doing a lot of 
research about it myself and I think 

776
00:39:26,701 --> 00:39:28,230
most people here marxism and they think 
socialism,

777
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:31,300
they think pooling all your money 
together,

778
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:32,440
you know,
making,

779
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,610
you know,
making things more.

780
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:38,690
Even in Venezuela,
everybody has an equal chance to starve 

781
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:38,940
to death.
So you know how they,

782
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,470
you know,
how the venezuelan government star solve

783
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:44,730
the problem of kids starving to death in
hospitals.

784
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:50,570
How they maDe it illegal for the doctors
to report starvation as the cause of 

785
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:53,360
death.
Right.

786
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:56,330
Wow.
That's Venezuela in a nutshell.

787
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:58,970
Yeah.
Everyone's equal there.

788
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:03,810
They all have the same number of bones 
to know on it.

789
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,470
That's a horrible thing,
but it's a horrible thing.

790
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:11,750
Undeniably.
But there's no like the connection 

791
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:14,550
between gender pronouns and murder this.
It's a big leap.

792
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,220
Yeah,
that's,

793
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:16,670
that's for sure.
That's for sure.

794
00:40:16,671 --> 00:40:21,671
Well,
that's why you have to look at the 

795
00:40:21,671 --> 00:40:21,671
underlying etiology,
you know,

796
00:40:21,671 --> 00:40:21,671
when you think,
well,

797
00:40:21,671 --> 00:40:22,130
what's,
what level at what is the level at which

798
00:40:22,131 --> 00:40:24,980
these things should be addressed?
While is it economic,

799
00:40:24,981 --> 00:40:25,790
is it political,

800
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:31,690
personal things of these,
this ideology and you understand where 

801
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:35,301
the roadmap leads.
You understand the x at the end of the 

802
00:40:35,301 --> 00:40:35,301
road.

803
00:40:35,301 --> 00:40:35,301
Yeah,
right.

804
00:40:35,301 --> 00:40:35,301
Absolutely.
Well,

805
00:40:35,301 --> 00:40:39,541
and I think that's why I recommended to 
people continually to read soldier and 

806
00:40:39,541 --> 00:40:42,511
hudson's gulag archipelago.
So actually there's a set of books that 

807
00:40:42,511 --> 00:40:46,070
let lay this out perfectly.
You reaD dostoyevsky's wrote a book 

808
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:49,651
called the or the devils and it's a,
it's a description of the initial 

809
00:40:49,651 --> 00:40:53,941
breakdown of the of orthodox christian 
society and in Russia in the late 18 

810
00:40:54,221 --> 00:40:57,010
hundreds and the rise of radical 
socialist ideas.

811
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:00,670
So it's sorta like the pro drama to the 
russian revolution to brilliant,

812
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,050
brilliant book,
brilliant book,

813
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:06,100
and it concentrates on the personalities
that are involved.

814
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:11,550
And then if you read after that social 
hudson's gulag archipelago where he 

815
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:12,730
details what he does in that book is 
quite remarkable.

816
00:41:12,731 --> 00:41:14,260
So he says,
look,

817
00:41:14,261 --> 00:41:16,960
there were tens of millions of people 
killed from 19,

818
00:41:16,961 --> 00:41:21,790
19 to 1959 in the soviet union and as a 
consequence of internal repression,

819
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:25,480
and it's so dreadful that words can't do
it justice.

820
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:30,540
I mean,
it's absolutely dreadful what happened 

821
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:30,540
in the soviet union.
I mean,

822
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:33,900
just for starters,
6 million ukrainians died in the 19 

823
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:34,490
thirties because of enforced,
in fact,

824
00:41:34,491 --> 00:41:35,900
in,
in the 19 thirties.

825
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:36,750
Here's,
here's how,

826
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:41,800
here's how terrible it was.
So all the food that the collective 

827
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:45,011
farmers,
newly collectivized farmers had 

828
00:41:45,011 --> 00:41:45,011
produced,
which wasn't very much by the way,

829
00:41:45,011 --> 00:41:45,650
was taken from them and brought to the 
cities.

830
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:47,750
So all the farmers starve to death.
Now here's,

831
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:52,780
here's how draconian it got.
So let's say you are the mother of some 

832
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:56,591
children and all your grain had been 
shipped off to the cities and you 

833
00:41:56,591 --> 00:41:56,591
thought,
well,

834
00:41:56,591 --> 00:41:57,110
I'm not going to have my children starve
to death.

835
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:02,320
I'm going to go out in the field and I'm
going to have on my hands and knees and 

836
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:05,681
I'm going to pick up the grains that are
leftover that the harvesters didn't 

837
00:42:05,681 --> 00:42:05,690
count.

838
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:08,330
Get.
And I'm going to feed those to my kids.

839
00:42:08,331 --> 00:42:13,331
That was punishable by death.
You were supposed To handy in those 

840
00:42:13,331 --> 00:42:16,190
extra bits of grain so that they could 
be shipped to the city as well.

841
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,070
So that was just the beginning of the 
fund and the soviet union.

842
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,260
And what solzhenitsyn did was say,
look,

843
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:27,290
this wasn't a consequence of the marxist
system gone wrong.

844
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:30,860
This was a consequence of the marxist 
system.

845
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,320
It waS inevitable consequence of the 
axioms of the marxist system.

846
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:39,320
And then he lays that out and it's all.
I think he got it right.

847
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:42,500
What is the nobel prize?
But what is the connection?

848
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:49,040
How much tyranny you have to impose in 
order to produce something like equality

849
00:42:49,041 --> 00:42:50,740
of outcome?
Either the,

850
00:42:50,741 --> 00:42:52,790
the thomas sowell is talked about this a
little bit too.

851
00:42:52,791 --> 00:42:57,791
He said what the people who are 
agitating for equality of outcome don't 

852
00:42:57,791 --> 00:43:01,250
understand is that you have to seed so 
much power to the authorities,

853
00:43:01,251 --> 00:43:03,980
to the government in order to ensure 
equality of outcome,

854
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:06,380
that a tyranny is inevitable.
And that's right.

855
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:09,320
And the other problem with equality of 
outcome,

856
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:11,760
this is also a big technical problem is 
like,

857
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:15,800
well what measure of outcome?
You know,

858
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:18,320
there's lots of outcomes,
like how happy are you?

859
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:21,020
How much pain are you in?
How healthy are you?

860
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:26,110
How much money do you have?
How much opportunity for movement 

861
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:29,021
forward do you have?
What's the width of your social 

862
00:43:29,021 --> 00:43:32,051
connections?
Like what's the quality of your 

863
00:43:32,051 --> 00:43:34,211
friendships?
Do you have exposure to art and 

864
00:43:34,211 --> 00:43:34,211
literature?

865
00:43:34,211 --> 00:43:37,030
Like you know,
you can multiply the number of 

866
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:38,120
dimensions of evaluation between people 
innumerably,

867
00:43:38,121 --> 00:43:39,200
right?
Because there's,

868
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:41,360
there's all sorts of ways to classify 
people.

869
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:44,900
You're going to get equality of outcome 
on every one of those measures.

870
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:51,360
It's like everyone going to have to be 
equally happy in their relationship and 

871
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:51,360
if not,
why not?

872
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:51,920
What?
Why?

873
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:54,740
Why stop with economic livestock with 
pay,

874
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,940
there's no place to stop.
So and that's.

875
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:02,060
And that's a huge technical problem 
because there is no place to stop.

876
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:05,660
There will be no stopping.
It's like nobody can have anything else,

877
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:08,050
nobody can have anything that everyone 
else doesn't have.

878
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:13,060
At the same time,
that's the ultimate outcome of equality 

879
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:15,911
of outcome.
While you think about what that would 

880
00:44:15,911 --> 00:44:15,911
mean,
it's terrible.

881
00:44:15,911 --> 00:44:16,130
Well,
instantly you think,

882
00:44:16,131 --> 00:44:21,131
oh,
well there's nothing but a tyrannical 

883
00:44:21,131 --> 00:44:23,201
system could impose that.
Have you ever debated and marks 

884
00:44:23,201 --> 00:44:23,201
supporter?

885
00:44:23,201 --> 00:44:24,890
Have you ever debated someone who is pro
equality of outcome?

886
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:26,870
No,
they don't debate me.

887
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,130
Well,
the only.

888
00:44:28,131 --> 00:44:33,131
The closest thing I think was two.
That was the debate I did at the 

889
00:44:33,131 --> 00:44:33,570
university of toronto about the bill,
see 16 issues,

890
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:37,410
but they didn't actually have a debate.
They had a forum which is the postmodern

891
00:44:37,411 --> 00:44:42,411
equivalent of a debate.
It's supposed to be friendlier I 

892
00:44:42,411 --> 00:44:42,411
suppose,
but no,

893
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:45,840
I haven't because people don't do it.
They don't ask me to do it,

894
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:51,680
but what is it about that idea or that 
ideology about marxism that's so 

895
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:57,200
attractive to young students and two 
university professors?

896
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:02,240
A good question.
I think it goes back to the issue of 

897
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:02,830
inequality and this is something that 
has to be dead seriously addressed.

898
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:04,350
He might say,
well,

899
00:45:04,351 --> 00:45:06,900
why is the left wing necessary?
Let let's,

900
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,550
let's put it that way.
So,

901
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,990
and then a subset of that would be,
well,

902
00:45:09,991 --> 00:45:11,310
why is the left wing attractive?

903
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:16,520
Well,
the left wing is necessary because 

904
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,240
inequality does spiral out of control 
and so there has to be a political voice

905
00:45:18,241 --> 00:45:22,170
for the dispossessed and you don't want 
people to stack up at zero,

906
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:24,300
you know,
where they can't play the game at all.

907
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:27,150
It's a bad idea.
Not only do you not,

908
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,210
if people stack up at zero,
they're too poor to get ahead at all.

909
00:45:30,211 --> 00:45:32,160
Let's say there are too poor to open a 
bank account.

910
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:37,370
There are too poor to buy enough food,
like they're stuck at zero and they 

911
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:38,100
can't get out of it.
It's a really bad scene because first of

912
00:45:38,101 --> 00:45:40,740
all,
that's a lot of suffering and that's not

913
00:45:40,741 --> 00:45:42,870
so good.
Second of all,

914
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:48,260
well at least in principle,
a lot of those people might be what 

915
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:52,430
might have something to offer the world 
or their children might and you want to 

916
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:54,930
open up avenues of opportunity to them 
so that they can succeed,

917
00:45:54,931 --> 00:45:57,480
but so that everyone else can benefit 
from their success.

918
00:45:57,990 --> 00:45:59,760
So,
and then the next thing is,

919
00:45:59,761 --> 00:46:04,761
well,
if the inequality gets out of hand too 

920
00:46:04,761 --> 00:46:06,471
much,
then the whole society starts to 

921
00:46:06,471 --> 00:46:06,471
destabilize because if you get enough 
people stacked up at zero,

922
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:11,480
especially young men,
you get enough young men stacked up at 

923
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:11,480
zero,
they think,

924
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,560
oh to hell with it,
we'll just flip the whole board over and

925
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:18,800
it'll settle in a new configuration and 
maybe we won't be stuck at zero in the 

926
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,400
new configuration.
so it foments revolutionary thinking.

927
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:25,730
So there's lots of reasons to be 
concerned about inequality and so you 

928
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:25,730
need a voice on the left to say,
look,

929
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:30,621
we got to parameterize the tendency 
towards inequality so that it doesn't 

930
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:31,920
destabilize the entire society so that 
it's.

931
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:34,460
Everybody has an opportunity to advance.
Like,

932
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:35,670
yes,
right.

933
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,530
You need that.
Okay.

934
00:46:37,531 --> 00:46:40,590
So that's the technical reason for the 
necessity of the left.

935
00:46:40,591 --> 00:46:42,930
And then I think it's attractive 
because.

936
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:48,170
well,
because young people can be resentful 

937
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:48,170
partly because they're at the bottom of 
the heap,

938
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:48,720
so to speak.
They're not [inaudible].

939
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:50,010
They're young,
like,

940
00:46:50,011 --> 00:46:50,880
look,
you want to be,

941
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:54,450
you want to be poor in 18,
you want to be rich and 80,

942
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:58,950
which you're going to choose.
Most people is going to take poor at 18.

943
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:01,620
Oh yeah.
Especially if you've been richard 80 and

944
00:47:01,621 --> 00:47:03,630
you understand you can get back there.
Yeah.

945
00:47:03,631 --> 00:47:08,631
Well that's the thing you know,
is that most of the people who are have 

946
00:47:08,631 --> 00:47:09,900
a million dollars or more in the United 
States,

947
00:47:09,901 --> 00:47:11,850
our old.
well why is that?

948
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:14,580
Well really do we need an explanation 
for that?

949
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:17,250
It's like you've had a lot more time to 
make money.

950
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:18,960
How would that be?
That's the explanatIon.

951
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:22,260
So that's one of the big drivers of 
inequality is just simply age,

952
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:27,470
but it's not obvious that the old rich 
people have an advantage over the young 

953
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:30,460
starting out people so,
so anyways,

954
00:47:30,461 --> 00:47:30,820
but any.

955
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:35,820
Anyhow,
maybe you're resentful and irritated 

956
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:38,161
because you're young and you're still at
the bottom of the heap and you know 

957
00:47:38,161 --> 00:47:40,771
you've got other problems too.
It's more difficult for people of your 

958
00:47:40,771 --> 00:47:41,230
race or ethnicity or gender.
At least you think it is.

959
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,300
And so you say,
well,

960
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,900
I want to make things fair,
and then that's also driven by some real

961
00:47:46,901 --> 00:47:49,330
compassion because nobody really likes 
that.

962
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:53,770
The consequences of radical inequality,
like nobody likes the fact that homeless

963
00:47:53,771 --> 00:47:57,190
people exist and have to go to the 
emergency ward,

964
00:47:57,191 --> 00:48:02,191
you know,
to get treated and they don't have 

965
00:48:02,191 --> 00:48:02,191
medical coverage and they have to live 
in tents on the street.

966
00:48:02,191 --> 00:48:04,780
And so if you have some compassion,
then you think,

967
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:09,781
well,
we got to do more for the poor and 

968
00:48:09,781 --> 00:48:09,781
dispossessed.
It's like,

969
00:48:09,781 --> 00:48:09,781
okay,
that's,

970
00:48:09,781 --> 00:48:12,190
that's an understandable sentiment.
But the problem is,

971
00:48:12,191 --> 00:48:13,990
is that the people.
But the problem is,

972
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:17,130
is that it's that,
that,

973
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:21,880
that desire to help is contaminated by 
resentment and ideological certainty.

974
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:26,940
And then also by something that george 
orwell pointed out so nicely in his 

975
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:26,940
book,
road to wigan pier.

976
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:29,980
It's like the typical middle class 
socialist.

977
00:48:29,981 --> 00:48:32,590
This was his diagnosis and he was a 
socialist by the way.

978
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,290
His diagnosis was the typical 
middleclass.

979
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,930
Intellectual socialist doesn't like the 
poor.

980
00:48:37,931 --> 00:48:42,931
In fact,
they don't have anything to do with the 

981
00:48:42,931 --> 00:48:42,931
poor,
their contemptuous of the poor,

982
00:48:42,931 --> 00:48:47,670
but they hate the rich.
And I think it's even more devious than 

983
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:49,570
that because I think who they hate are 
the successful,

984
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:55,470
some of the successful or rich,
but really who they hate is the 

985
00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:55,470
successful.
It's cain and abel.

986
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:59,080
It's the retelling of cain and abel,
and so there's some positive motivations

987
00:48:59,081 --> 00:49:02,230
for being engaged on the left and 
there's a lot of negative motivations as

988
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:07,231
well,
and the people who are really driven by 

989
00:49:07,231 --> 00:49:07,231
the radical left ideology that real 
radicals,

990
00:49:07,231 --> 00:49:11,850
they're almost all driven by by 
resentment and hatred as far as I'm 

991
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:13,530
concerned now the law.

992
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:18,660
LeT's look at both extremes.
So back to the idea of the of the 

993
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:24,630
ideological and verbal territory.
I said with bill [inaudible] that I 

994
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:28,081
wouldn't speak the language of the 
radical leftist because I don't think 

995
00:49:28,081 --> 00:49:28,081
that that language should define the 
game,

996
00:49:28,081 --> 00:49:30,100
but let's say it does.
So here's the game.

997
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:35,820
the world is a battleground of groups 
and the are battling for power.

998
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,270
That's it.
That's the game.

999
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:40,570
And some of them win and they oppress 
those who don't win.

1000
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,310
So that's how we're going to view the 
world.

1001
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,710
Okay?
Now the left is say,

1002
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:46,270
okay,
well here's the oppressed people,

1003
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:51,660
the oppressors,
the patriarchy type patriarchal type 

1004
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:52,840
space should be ashamed of themselves 
and give up some power.

1005
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:58,520
The right wingers,
the radical right wingers look at that 

1006
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:58,520
and they say,
oh,

1007
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:58,910
I see,
so the game is ethnic identity.

1008
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,660
Is identity politics,
okay?

1009
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,430
Were white males.

1010
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:09,210
We're not going to lose.
That's the right wing version of 

1011
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:09,210
identity politics.
It's like,

1012
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:11,530
screw you.
If we're going to divide into groups,

1013
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:15,280
if we're going to divide into tribes and
I'm in my tribe,

1014
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,680
I'm not going to get all guilty and 
lose,

1015
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:22,360
I'm going to get all cruel and win,
and that's like.

1016
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:23,230
Then you think,
well,

1017
00:50:23,231 --> 00:50:28,231
there's people in the middle.
They're kind of looking back and forth 

1018
00:50:28,231 --> 00:50:28,820
which side of the identity politics 
spectrum I am I get a fallen.

1019
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:32,270
do I want to go with,
do I want to go?

1020
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:35,810
Do I want to be driven primarily by 
compassion and I'm,

1021
00:50:35,811 --> 00:50:38,540
am I going to accept guilt for my 
historical privilege?

1022
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:41,450
So that's one possibility.
And then I'm the oppressor.

1023
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:46,720
I'm the member of the oppressor group,
or am I going to say no to hell with 

1024
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:46,720
that?
I'm just going to play to win.

1025
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,260
Well then I'm going to go to the right.
It's like,

1026
00:50:48,261 --> 00:50:53,261
well,
my sense is how about we don't play 

1027
00:50:53,261 --> 00:50:53,261
either of those games and the reason we 
shouldn't play the miss?

1028
00:50:53,261 --> 00:50:55,310
Well,
the soviet played the left lean game and

1029
00:50:55,311 --> 00:51:00,311
like killed.
Who knows how many tens of millions of 

1030
00:51:00,311 --> 00:51:00,740
people.
You can't even count it accurately.

1031
00:51:00,741 --> 00:51:03,230
The estimates range from 20 to 100 
million.

1032
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:07,550
Those are pretty big error bars and that
numologists maybe a $100 million.

1033
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:10,300
Certainly $60 million,
so okay.

1034
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,130
That didn't work out so well,
and then there's the nazis.

1035
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:17,300
They played ethnic identity politics and
racial superiority.

1036
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:19,400
It's like,
why do we want to play that game?

1037
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:25,450
See what I've been trying to do,
really what I've been trying to do for 

1038
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:25,450
the last 30 years is say,
look,

1039
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:28,580
there's heavy temptations to play those 
sorts of games,

1040
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:34,720
but that's not the only game in town.
It's a much better game to play 

1041
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:34,720
individual.

1042
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,010
It's like get your act together,
stand up in the world,

1043
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:42,400
make something of yourself,
stay away from the ideological 

1044
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,070
oversimplifications,
set your house in order.

1045
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,260
That's rule six in the,
in the,

1046
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:47,210
in this book,
so I have a book rule in there,

1047
00:51:47,211 --> 00:51:52,211
says set your house in perfect order 
before he criticized the world and it's 

1048
00:51:52,211 --> 00:51:54,800
a very dark chapter about the 
motivations of the columbine high school

1049
00:51:54,801 --> 00:51:56,840
killers and this other guy named carl 
pans ram,

1050
00:51:56,841 --> 00:51:59,630
who was a serial rapist and arsonist and
murderer,

1051
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:03,710
and he wrote an autobiography and the 
columbine kids also wrote about why they

1052
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:06,170
did what they did.
They're resentful to the core,

1053
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:07,340
bitter,
bitter,

1054
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:12,030
resentful,
terrible and well,

1055
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,750
I'm suggesting that people stay away 
from that resentment.

1056
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,520
Resentfulness And bitterness,
even though life is hard and,

1057
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:20,060
and there's malevolence in the world.
It's like,

1058
00:52:20,061 --> 00:52:21,170
yeah,
you can,

1059
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,800
you can tell a story where everyone's a 
victim because we all die.

1060
00:52:24,830 --> 00:52:27,080
We all get sick,
you know,

1061
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:27,860
and,
and,

1062
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:32,180
and things happened to us that are 
bitter and terrible betrayal.

1063
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,970
Deceit,
lies like people heard us on purpose,

1064
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,160
you know,
so it's not just the tragedy of life,

1065
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,040
it's malevolence as well.
It's everyone's a victim.

1066
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:45,280
You can tell that story.
The problem is if you tell that story 

1067
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:45,280
and you start to act it out,
you make all of that worse.

1068
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:50,680
That's the problem and it's so.
This is why partly I got attracted to 

1069
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:53,630
christian imagery,
at least in part because there's an idea

1070
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:58,631
in christianity that you should pick up 
your goddamn cross and like walk up the 

1071
00:52:58,631 --> 00:53:02,201
hill and that's dramatically.
That's correct.

1072
00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:04,940
That's the right answer.
He's like,

1073
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:10,630
you've got a heavy load of suffering to 
bear and a fair bit of it's going to be 

1074
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:14,381
unjust.
SO what are you going to do about it 

1075
00:53:14,381 --> 00:53:15,470
except it voluntarily and try to 
transform as a consequence.

1076
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:21,100
That's the right answer.
It's the right answer because the rest 

1077
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:23,951
of it is tribalism and were too 
technologically powerful to get all 

1078
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:26,150
tribal again.
What's exciting to me is that

1079
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:31,190
I think this is the first time in my 
life that I've ever seen so much 

1080
00:53:31,201 --> 00:53:36,201
communication on these subjects and I 
think so much recognition about the 

1081
00:53:36,201 --> 00:53:41,151
consequences of tribal toxic tribalism,
this tribal thinking that everyone seems

1082
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:43,800
to be engaged in on the right and on the
left.

1083
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:49,180
I mean in America,
you need to go no further than going 

1084
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:51,120
back and forth from cnn to fox news to 
say something's wrong here.

1085
00:53:51,121 --> 00:53:53,250
These are,
these are supposed to be news outlets.

1086
00:53:53,251 --> 00:53:58,251
You have to completely dIfferent 
narratives and that has nothing to do 

1087
00:53:58,251 --> 00:54:01,011
with what we're talking about with 
gender politics and radical left 

1088
00:54:01,011 --> 00:54:04,611
socialism and marxism.
W what what you're seeing in 

1089
00:54:04,611 --> 00:54:07,581
universities though is a radical 
departure from what I always considered 

1090
00:54:09,721 --> 00:54:14,721
universities.
Great for what I always considered 

1091
00:54:14,721 --> 00:54:18,141
universities great for is separating 
from your parents challenging belief 

1092
00:54:18,671 --> 00:54:23,671
systems and being engaged in the the 
works of brilliant people who you can 

1093
00:54:24,961 --> 00:54:29,910
compare all of their findings and their 
discoveries and sit down and debate them

1094
00:54:29,911 --> 00:54:33,210
in class and when I was a kid,
when I was in high school,

1095
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:35,040
went to a very good high school.

1096
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:37,470
Newton South high school in newton,
Massachusetts,

1097
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:42,770
and uh,
one of the thIngs that they did is they 

1098
00:54:42,770 --> 00:54:43,980
put on a debate between a guy from the 
moral majority,

1099
00:54:43,981 --> 00:54:48,981
which was this a right wing,
a christian group that I don't even know

1100
00:54:49,171 --> 00:54:50,280
if they're around anymore,
but there,

1101
00:54:50,281 --> 00:54:52,770
this was 19,
I was 14,

1102
00:54:52,771 --> 00:54:57,771
so 81 and a barney frank who was that 
congressman's now one of the first 

1103
00:54:58,771 --> 00:55:01,710
openly gay guys in congress.
And,

1104
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:03,010
and,
uh,

1105
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:08,240
you got to watch these two people in 
this auditorium debate there their 

1106
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,530
points in this mara majority guy had 
this,

1107
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,370
you know,
right wing ronald reagan's sort of point

1108
00:55:14,371 --> 00:55:19,371
of view and barney frank was kinda crazy
and he's got busted in some male 

1109
00:55:19,711 --> 00:55:21,280
prostitutes scandal.
And,

1110
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:23,970
but the gay community,
that's not that big of a deal.

1111
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:28,080
And uh,
just barney frank took them apart.

1112
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:31,290
It was brilliant to watch.
But it was a real debate.

1113
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:36,320
It was fascinating and he got to see a,
a mediocre mine versus a great mind.

1114
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:39,690
And you got to see this little thing.
And I was like,

1115
00:55:39,691 --> 00:55:44,691
wow,
this is one of the things that's always 

1116
00:55:44,691 --> 00:55:47,421
attracted me about the,
the idea that two people with different 

1117
00:55:48,401 --> 00:55:53,401
viewpoints can get together in front of 
a neutral audience and these people can 

1118
00:55:53,401 --> 00:55:56,030
sort of decipher which,
which way these people were thinking and

1119
00:55:56,031 --> 00:55:56,560
why they're thing.

1120
00:55:56,610 --> 00:55:57,810
Yeah.
Well I'm in bad.

1121
00:55:57,811 --> 00:56:02,811
Is that is rife with conflict,
that as that is the alternative is to 

1122
00:56:02,811 --> 00:56:07,400
separate,
as you pointed out into two camps that 

1123
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:07,400
don't talk.
Yes.

1124
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,821
And the thing is that the consequence of
not talking is that you fight that 

1125
00:56:10,821 --> 00:56:15,591
that's the end game because the only way
you can stop from fighting with other 

1126
00:56:15,591 --> 00:56:17,850
people is by negotiating with them.
And you know,

1127
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:20,260
one of the things that's also 
interesting,

1128
00:56:20,261 --> 00:56:23,130
and this is partly why silicon valley 
leans to the left,

1129
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:28,140
is that a fair bit of your political 
preference is determined by your 

1130
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:30,880
biological temperament.
It's a strongly influenced.

1131
00:56:30,881 --> 00:56:35,110
So if you're a creative type who's kind 
of disorderly,

1132
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:39,370
then you're likely to be on the liberal 
left end of the distribution.

1133
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:43,300
And if you're a non creative type who's 
orderly and,

1134
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:48,810
and especially if you're orderly,
then you tend to be on the right wing 

1135
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:48,810
end of things.

1136
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:49,330
And so,
and what?

1137
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:50,890
Well,
why is that?

1138
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:52,750
Why?
Why do those variations exist?

1139
00:56:52,751 --> 00:56:55,390
Well,
they exist because some of the time your

1140
00:56:55,391 --> 00:57:00,391
best strategy is to do what other people
have done and shut the hell up and just 

1141
00:57:00,391 --> 00:57:00,391
do it.
Run the algorithm,

1142
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,530
right?
The pathways already laid clear.

1143
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:05,650
It works,
stay in the damn rut and move forward.

1144
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:07,750
Okay,
so that's the conservative approach.

1145
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:11,200
And when things are going right,
it's the right approach.

1146
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:16,620
the problem is,
is that sometimes it's not the right 

1147
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:17,260
approach because something has shifted 
and so something new has to emerge.

1148
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:21,040
And so then there's a bunch of people 
who are adapted to the new and those are

1149
00:57:21,041 --> 00:57:26,041
the entrepreneurial and creative types.
And of course they dominate silicon 

1150
00:57:26,041 --> 00:57:26,041
valley because it's a very 
entrepreneurial,

1151
00:57:26,041 --> 00:57:28,900
it's a very entrepreneurial,
what would you call it?

1152
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:34,650
Geography.
And so they're going to lean to the 

1153
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:34,650
left,
but they have to understand.

1154
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:37,330
People have to understand that the left 
and the right need each other.

1155
00:57:37,331 --> 00:57:40,840
The liberals and the conservatives need 
each other liberal start companies,

1156
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:46,440
conservatives run them,
and the problem with the conservatives 

1157
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:46,440
is,
well,

1158
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:48,640
they caN only run a company in one 
direction because they're conservative.

1159
00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:53,730
They don't think outside the box,
but so if the coMpany is working in the 

1160
00:57:53,730 --> 00:57:54,610
product line is good and everything is 
stable,

1161
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:58,090
like hire some conservatives because 
they'll maximize efficiency and the move

1162
00:57:58,091 --> 00:58:01,810
down that track,
but if the track is no longer going in a

1163
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:03,880
good direction because something's 
changed,

1164
00:58:03,881 --> 00:58:08,881
the environment's changed.
Well then yOu've got to bring in the 

1165
00:58:08,881 --> 00:58:10,531
creative people and so we need each 
other and the only way that we can 

1166
00:58:10,571 --> 00:58:15,571
survive the fact that we're different 
and the fact that we need each other is 

1167
00:58:15,571 --> 00:58:16,510
by continually talking.
We have taught constantly.

1168
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:17,500
It's like,
well,

1169
00:58:17,501 --> 00:58:22,501
how much of what we're doIng should we 
preserve versus how much of what we're 

1170
00:58:22,501 --> 00:58:22,630
doing should we transform?

1171
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:26,110
And the answer is we don't know because 
the environment keeps changing.

1172
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:28,630
So what do we do about that?
We talk.

1173
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:30,610
No,
I was on a cbc,

1174
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:35,640
canadian broadcasting corporation 
interview a couple of days ago and they 

1175
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:36,040
took me to task.
I tweeted out this,

1176
00:58:36,041 --> 00:58:39,880
uh,
this invitation to the keck boys to fill

1177
00:58:39,881 --> 00:58:42,460
out this program that I developed called
future authoring.

1178
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:44,940
And it helps people make a plan.
The boys.

1179
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:45,550
Yeah.
Well,

1180
00:58:45,551 --> 00:58:47,080
they're,
they're an online group.

1181
00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:50,340
They're there,
they run Pakistan.

1182
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:53,000
it's this fictional polity.
It's a,

1183
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:56,020
it's a satire of identity politics.
Essentially.

1184
00:58:56,970 --> 00:58:58,840
We're going to,
we're going to be our ethnicity,

1185
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:03,940
highly demonized santa highly demonized 
and with good reason for,

1186
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:09,291
with some individual examples of racism 
and nazi-ism and there's lots of 

1187
00:59:10,191 --> 00:59:11,230
misbehavior.
Yeah.

1188
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:12,530
Yeah.
It's like graffiti.

1189
00:59:12,531 --> 00:59:13,150
It's like online

1190
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:14,300
graffiti,
something like that.

1191
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:15,300
So,
um,

1192
00:59:15,730 --> 00:59:20,730
and,
and the keck boys are the ones who are 

1193
00:59:20,730 --> 00:59:22,120
often using the pepe memes for.
And you know,

1194
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:25,070
the left regardS peppy as a hate symbol.
Pepe the frog.

1195
00:59:25,071 --> 00:59:29,000
Pepe the frog feels good for.
That's kind of reprehensible frog.

1196
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:31,490
And so I tweeted out to them,
I said,

1197
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:37,700
keck boys,
seek your four chan rescue yourself from

1198
00:59:37,701 --> 00:59:41,300
the underworld,
use code pepe for future authoring.

1199
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:45,560
So it's free for one week.
So they had to figure out what it meant.

1200
00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:47,840
And then I showed this picture of 
Michigan j frog,

1201
00:59:47,841 --> 00:59:49,520
which is the frog from old warner 
brothers,

1202
00:59:49,521 --> 00:59:52,320
cartoon dancing frog that wouldn't 
perform when anyone's watching it.

1203
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:54,800
So cbc,
hold that out and said,

1204
00:59:54,801 --> 00:59:55,760
well look,
aren't you,

1205
00:59:56,210 --> 00:59:59,240
aren't you like appealing to the 
radical?

1206
00:59:59,241 --> 01:00:00,080
RIght?
And I said,

1207
01:00:00,081 --> 01:00:01,100
well no,
what I'm doing.

1208
01:00:01,101 --> 01:00:01,580
I said,
look,

1209
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:03,860
these people are attracted by the 
radical right.

1210
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:08,920
Although they're satirists and juvenile 
satirists and graffiti types and you 

1211
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:08,920
know,
they're,

1212
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:10,670
they're playing a weird wrinkle being 
naughty.

1213
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:13,550
That's exactly what they're doing.
They're provoking and I,

1214
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,170
my sense was,
well,

1215
01:00:15,171 --> 01:00:20,171
why don't you develop yourself as an 
individual and get the hell out of the 

1216
01:00:20,171 --> 01:00:20,171
ideological trap.
so here's my program,

1217
01:00:20,171 --> 01:00:24,881
which helps you write about your future 
and that'll help you decide who you are 

1218
01:00:24,881 --> 01:00:27,800
as an individual because that's the way 
out of the ideological trap.

1219
01:00:28,330 --> 01:00:33,330
It's like.
And that's the way obviously what's the 

1220
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:35,060
way out of tribalism first,
the way out of tribalism is not to never

1221
01:00:35,061 --> 01:00:38,600
join a tribe.
You actually have to join a tribe as you

1222
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:39,290
mature,
right?

1223
01:00:39,291 --> 01:00:41,570
Because what happens Is first of all,
you're an infant,

1224
01:00:42,330 --> 01:00:45,470
then you have your parents to to make a 
relationship with,

1225
01:00:45,471 --> 01:00:47,330
but then when you move from your 
parents,

1226
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:49,250
you have your tribe,
you have your group.

1227
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,470
Maybe it's the music you listen to,
it's the gang.

1228
01:00:51,471 --> 01:00:56,471
You hang around with whatever.
You have to be socialized into the 

1229
01:00:56,471 --> 01:00:59,741
tribe.
you have to because otherwise you stay 

1230
01:00:59,741 --> 01:00:59,741
dependent infant.
Okay,

1231
01:00:59,741 --> 01:01:01,430
but now you're socialized into the 
tribe.

1232
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:03,440
Was that where it ends?
It's like,

1233
01:01:03,441 --> 01:01:08,441
no.
The next thIng to do is differentiate 

1234
01:01:08,441 --> 01:01:11,561
yourself from the tribe while still 
knowing how to behave within the tribe 

1235
01:01:11,561 --> 01:01:15,760
will.
that's the called the individualism and 

1236
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:15,760
that's I think what the west got right?
We figured that out.

1237
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:20,171
It's like yOu're more than your.
You have to be a member of a group 

1238
01:01:20,171 --> 01:01:21,260
because otherwise you're not socialized 
to not good for anyone.

1239
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,960
You don't have to be able to play on a 
team man.

1240
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,150
You have to have team loyalty.
Okay,

1241
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:29,600
but that isn't where you should stop.
You should take the next step and become

1242
01:01:29,601 --> 01:01:32,870
a fully developed individual and see.

1243
01:01:32,870 --> 01:01:35,750
The problem with being just a group 
member is that the group,

1244
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:40,310
it's the problem with conservatism.
The group is a fixed entity,

1245
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:43,460
it has its rules and regulations,
and if you're a Member,

1246
01:01:43,461 --> 01:01:46,520
that's all you are,
but the group can go badly wrong,

1247
01:01:46,521 --> 01:01:51,521
so the group needs individuals to keep 
the group alive and revivified so you 

1248
01:01:51,521 --> 01:01:53,180
have to become an individual so you can 
revivify the group.

1249
01:01:53,830 --> 01:01:58,830
That's the call,
that's the call in the west to heroism 

1250
01:01:58,830 --> 01:02:01,841
essentially to noble way of living is to
develop yourself past your group 

1251
01:02:01,841 --> 01:02:06,161
identity so that you can reconfigure the
game when that becomes necessary and I 

1252
01:02:06,501 --> 01:02:11,501
think that there's a very influential 
line of developmental psychology 

1253
01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:14,810
pioneered by john piaget that laid that 
out as a developmental.

1254
01:02:16,130 --> 01:02:21,130
What would progression first year child.
Then you're a member of a group,

1255
01:02:22,231 --> 01:02:25,020
then you're an individual.
It's like get to the individual level.

1256
01:02:25,170 --> 01:02:27,720
That's the solution.
It's a solution to tribalism,

1257
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:33,140
but you have to accept responsibility to
do that and this is what your future 

1258
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:34,170
authoring program is basically all 
about.

1259
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:34,570
Man,
it's.

1260
01:02:34,590 --> 01:02:37,680
It's a wonderful program.
It's in along with this book,

1261
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:42,980
rules and guidelines for life.
I think that's one of the things that a 

1262
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:45,801
lot of young people are lacking is a 
structure to how to go about 

1263
01:02:45,801 --> 01:02:48,240
establishing who they are in the world.
Yeah.

1264
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:53,360
Well that's,
you know what's really cool and it's 

1265
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:53,610
been really quite remarkable I would 
say,

1266
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:57,930
is that what I've noticed when I've been
speaking publicly say over the last year

1267
01:02:57,931 --> 01:03:02,931
and a half because there's a hole in our
culture where there should be a 

1268
01:03:02,931 --> 01:03:06,210
discussion about maturity,
truth and responsibility.

1269
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:08,490
No one's talking about that.
Okay,

1270
01:03:08,491 --> 01:03:10,650
so now I'll come up and they'll start 
talking about that.

1271
01:03:10,651 --> 01:03:15,651
I'll say,
look like what should you do with your 

1272
01:03:15,651 --> 01:03:15,651
life?

1273
01:03:15,651 --> 01:03:16,530
Well,
take care of yourself,

1274
01:03:17,370 --> 01:03:22,370
but take care of yourself in a way that 
also means that simultaneously you're 

1275
01:03:22,370 --> 01:03:25,911
taking care of your family and that and 
also means that simultaneously you're 

1276
01:03:25,911 --> 01:03:26,980
taking care of the broader community.
So that's kind of your goal.

1277
01:03:26,981 --> 01:03:29,730
So orient yourself towards that personal
success,

1278
01:03:29,970 --> 01:03:32,790
but in a way that your success breeds 
success.

1279
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:34,530
Because if you're going to establish the
name,

1280
01:03:34,531 --> 01:03:36,630
why not established like a really good 
day and that's a good one.

1281
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:38,310
It's good for you.
It's good for everyone else.

1282
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:39,930
Yes.
Okay.

1283
01:03:40,290 --> 01:03:42,450
That'll give you life.
Some meaning now adopt.

1284
01:03:42,470 --> 01:03:44,220
Make a plan,
generate a vision.

1285
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:46,710
That's what the future authoring program
helps people with mega.

1286
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:51,950
Develop a vision of what your life could
be like if if it was worth living 

1287
01:03:51,950 --> 01:03:55,730
despite all its suffering.
It's like what would you need so that 

1288
01:03:55,730 --> 01:03:55,730
you would be happy to be alive.

1289
01:03:55,740 --> 01:04:00,740
You'd find your life meaningful so you 
don't get all bitter and resentful and 

1290
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:03,390
cruel and hostile and ideologically 
adult and like murderous and genocidal.

1291
01:04:03,650 --> 01:04:06,150
It's like none of that.
You think real hard.

1292
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:11,420
How would you have to configure your 
life so that despite its suffering and 

1293
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:12,960
the malevolence that's part of it,
that you would regard it as worthwhile.

1294
01:04:13,270 --> 01:04:14,970
It's not.
It's up to you to develop a vision.

1295
01:04:15,210 --> 01:04:20,210
Then put a plan into practice and so 
when I talk to people about this and 

1296
01:04:20,210 --> 01:04:22,500
most of my audiences or young men,
it's probably about 65 slash 35.

1297
01:04:22,501 --> 01:04:24,960
More and more women are showing up,
but that's about what it is right now.

1298
01:04:25,590 --> 01:04:30,590
The halls are dead silent.
You could hear a pin drop because 

1299
01:04:30,590 --> 01:04:34,581
nobody's said so clearly for like 50 
years that almost all the meaning that 

1300
01:04:34,581 --> 01:04:38,580
you will need to get you through the 
hard times of your life is going to be a

1301
01:04:38,581 --> 01:04:43,050
consequence of adopting responsibility,
not have rights and impulsive action.

1302
01:04:43,290 --> 01:04:47,190
Impulsive freedom like fine rights.
Yeah,

1303
01:04:47,310 --> 01:04:48,840
got it.
Freedom,

1304
01:04:48,930 --> 01:04:51,270
no problem.
Even freedom to do impulsive things,

1305
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:56,480
fine,
but that isn't where you're going to 

1306
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,341
find the meaning that keeps you 
sustained through the storms of life 

1307
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:01,080
that's going to be take care of 
yourself.

1308
01:05:01,110 --> 01:05:04,140
You take care of your intimate partner,
you take care of your damn family.

1309
01:05:04,530 --> 01:05:07,020
You don't run off.
You take care of your community.

1310
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:12,500
You rescue the wisdom from the past.
You stand up straight and he be 

1311
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:14,460
courageous despite the fact that life is
tragic and tainted by malevolence.

1312
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:17,010
It's like that's the.
That's ancient.

1313
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:17,980
That's what that

1314
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:22,980
is.
Then understanding that there's 

1315
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:23,920
structure and discipline and that I am 
in a lot of ways,

1316
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:26,140
both of those things you described 
earlier.

1317
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:31,380
I'm in a lot of ways.
My mind is creative and I'm always a 

1318
01:05:32,530 --> 01:05:37,530
sort of half paying attention to things,
but I'm also right and it's one of the 

1319
01:05:37,530 --> 01:05:42,211
reasons why I think I'm.
I so relate to both sides of this issue 

1320
01:05:42,490 --> 01:05:44,560
because I could have been one of the 
reasons you're successful.

1321
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:48,790
I could have easily been some hardcore 
right wing asshole.

1322
01:05:48,791 --> 01:05:52,600
I'm a competition oriented person that 
I've been since I was a child.

1323
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:55,960
I grew up competing in martial arts 
tournament.

1324
01:05:55,990 --> 01:05:56,440
I mean,
that's.

1325
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:59,950
And you have to be a hard person to do 
that.

1326
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:02,140
You have to understand what discipline 
is,

1327
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:05,350
but before that I was an artist.
I wanted to be a cartoon it.

1328
01:06:05,351 --> 01:06:08,020
I wanted to do comic books.
That's what I wanted to do.

1329
01:06:08,021 --> 01:06:11,720
I wanted to be an illustrator.
If it wasn't for one bad teacher in high

1330
01:06:11,721 --> 01:06:14,020
school that totally shied me away from 
art,

1331
01:06:14,290 --> 01:06:16,270
I probably would have went into that as 
a,

1332
01:06:16,271 --> 01:06:19,840
as a living.
When I look at both sides,

1333
01:06:19,841 --> 01:06:21,280
I see myself in both sides.

1334
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:22,260
Yep.
Yep.

1335
01:06:22,830 --> 01:06:24,660
The other thing I've been telling young 
men is that,

1336
01:06:25,070 --> 01:06:30,070
and this is something I think that you 
could relate to tremendously as I read 

1337
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:32,010
this new testament line while it decades
ago,

1338
01:06:32,011 --> 01:06:37,011
and I could never understand it.
It's the lion is the meek shall inherit 

1339
01:06:37,011 --> 01:06:39,981
the earth.
And I thought there's something wrong 

1340
01:06:39,981 --> 01:06:39,981
with that.
That line,

1341
01:06:39,981 --> 01:06:43,071
it just doesn't make sense to me.
Meet just doesn't seem to me to be a 

1342
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:45,651
moral virtue.
And so I did a series of biblical 

1343
01:06:45,651 --> 01:06:49,041
lectures this year,
like 15 of them and that was also a 

1344
01:06:49,041 --> 01:06:49,041
weird little experience that we can talk
about,

1345
01:06:49,041 --> 01:06:51,360
but I was looking through the,
these,

1346
01:06:51,390 --> 01:06:53,700
these sayings,
these maximums and that was one of them.

1347
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:58,940
The meek shall inherit the earth,
but I've been using this site called 

1348
01:06:58,940 --> 01:06:59,850
bible hub and it's very interesting.
It's very organiZed,

1349
01:06:59,851 --> 01:07:04,851
very interesting.
So you have a biblical line and then 

1350
01:07:04,851 --> 01:07:04,851
they.

1351
01:07:04,851 --> 01:07:08,120
They have like three pages of commentary
on each line and so because people have 

1352
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:10,920
commented on every verse in the bible 
like to the two degree,

1353
01:07:10,921 --> 01:07:15,921
that's almost unimaginable.
So you can look and see all the 

1354
01:07:15,921 --> 01:07:18,411
interpretations and all the translations
and get some sense of what the gen 

1355
01:07:18,411 --> 01:07:22,240
genuine meaning might be and they line 
the meek shall inherit the earth.

1356
01:07:22,890 --> 01:07:27,890
Meek is not a good translation or the 
word has moved in the 300 years or so,

1357
01:07:28,230 --> 01:07:31,590
300 years or so since it was translated.
What it means is this,

1358
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:38,000
those who have swords and know how to 
use them but keep the machine will 

1359
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,991
inherit the world.
And that's another thing I've been 

1360
01:07:41,991 --> 01:07:41,991
telling.
Yeah,

1361
01:07:41,991 --> 01:07:43,290
no kidding.
That's a big difference.

1362
01:07:43,291 --> 01:07:48,291
It's so great.
And so one of the things I tell young 

1363
01:07:48,291 --> 01:07:50,601
men and young women as well,
but the young men really need to hear 

1364
01:07:50,601 --> 01:07:51,420
this more,
I think is that you should be a monster.

1365
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:53,430
You know,
because everyone says,

1366
01:07:53,431 --> 01:07:55,350
well,
you should be harmless.

1367
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:57,270
Virtuous.
You shouldn't do anyone any harm.

1368
01:07:57,271 --> 01:07:59,340
You should sheath your competitive 
instincts.

1369
01:07:59,341 --> 01:08:00,860
You shouldn't try to win.
You know,

1370
01:08:00,930 --> 01:08:03,160
you don't want to be too aggressive.
You don't want to be to assert.

1371
01:08:03,161 --> 01:08:04,980
If you want to take a back seat and all 
of that,

1372
01:08:04,981 --> 01:08:09,420
it's like no wrong.
You should be a monster,

1373
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:12,360
an absolute monster,
and then you should learn how to control

1374
01:08:12,361 --> 01:08:13,980
it.
Do you know the expression?

1375
01:08:13,981 --> 01:08:16,010
It's better to be a in a garden

1376
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:17,570
than a gardener and award.
Right?

1377
01:08:17,571 --> 01:08:18,920
Exactly.
That's exactly it.

1378
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:24,520
And that's exactly right.
And so when I tell young men that they 

1379
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:24,520
think,
well,

1380
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:24,770
lots of them are competitive,
they're low in agreeableness,

1381
01:08:24,771 --> 01:08:26,330
you know,
because that's part of being competitive

1382
01:08:26,331 --> 01:08:31,331
temperamentally.
So because there's something wrong with 

1383
01:08:31,331 --> 01:08:31,331
being competitive,
there's nothing wrong with it.

1384
01:08:31,331 --> 01:08:35,980
There's something wrong with cheating.
There's something wrong with being a 

1385
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:36,860
tyrant is something wrong with winning 
unfairly.

1386
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:40,220
All of those things are bad,
but you don't want people to win.

1387
01:08:40,221 --> 01:08:42,770
What's the difference between trying to 
win and striving?

1388
01:08:43,310 --> 01:08:48,310
You want to eradicate striving.
What's the uncomfortable feeling that 

1389
01:08:48,310 --> 01:08:50,330
people associate with losing when 
they've personally experienced it?

1390
01:08:50,570 --> 01:08:53,930
They look at losing as they have.
They've been oppressed or they have been

1391
01:08:53,931 --> 01:08:58,931
heard,
but what they don't understand is that 

1392
01:08:58,931 --> 01:09:00,830
as the motivation for growth and one of 
the most beautiful things that I think a

1393
01:09:00,831 --> 01:09:03,560
young person can get involved in his 
martial arts,

1394
01:09:03,770 --> 01:09:07,070
because martial arts teach you that in a
way that very few things do.

1395
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:10,850
They teach you in,
especially jujitsu because jujitsu is so

1396
01:09:10,851 --> 01:09:15,851
complex and there's so many 
possibilities to it that it attracts a 

1397
01:09:15,851 --> 01:09:17,930
lot of really smart people.
If you think of jujitsu,

1398
01:09:17,931 --> 01:09:22,931
you would think of like brutish 
individuals engaging in this hard 

1399
01:09:22,931 --> 01:09:23,870
martial art.
If you go to a real good jujitsu school,

1400
01:09:23,871 --> 01:09:28,871
you see nerds,
you see a bunch of really smart kids 

1401
01:09:28,871 --> 01:09:31,880
that really get obsessed with the 
possibilities of this physical language.

1402
01:09:32,330 --> 01:09:36,980
This physical language also teaches you 
the consequences of not working hard,

1403
01:09:37,190 --> 01:09:42,190
of not being prepared,
of not understanding positions of not 

1404
01:09:42,190 --> 01:09:44,000
doing due diligence and doing the work,
and it's.

1405
01:09:44,001 --> 01:09:49,001
It's an amazing,
amazing scaffolding for developing your 

1406
01:09:49,491 --> 01:09:51,380
life.
Teaches you how to lose.

1407
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:53,090
Yes.
That's very important.

1408
01:09:53,091 --> 01:09:56,850
Definition of a winner is someone who 
never let losing stop.

1409
01:09:57,030 --> 01:10:02,030
yes,
and the idea that a single loss in the 

1410
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:02,990
competition is somehow a defeat is 
completely insane.

1411
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:08,080
First of all,
well let's say you're a hockey player 

1412
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:08,080
and you're a good player and you.
You lose the tournament.

1413
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:08,180
It's like,
well,

1414
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:09,800
so what?
You played the game.

1415
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:15,010
You're increasing your skills.
It's like there's always next time and 

1416
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:17,120
one of the things that I've also been 
telling people,

1417
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:20,690
informing people about is the idea that 
life isn't a game.

1418
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:26,020
It's a series of games and the right 
ethic is to be the winner of the series 

1419
01:10:26,031 --> 01:10:31,031
of games and part of that means you,
while you have learned how to be a good 

1420
01:10:31,031 --> 01:10:31,130
loser because you're not gonna win every
single game,

1421
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:36,280
but you also have to embrace those 
losses as learning experiences and the 

1422
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:38,270
people that have never lost or afraid of
losing their afraid of learning.

1423
01:10:38,510 --> 01:10:43,510
You're afraid of That feeling of that 
terrible feeling that you get from 

1424
01:10:43,510 --> 01:10:45,080
losing is so beneficial.
It's aided me in so many ways,

1425
01:10:45,081 --> 01:10:50,081
like it's one of the reasons also one of
the reasons why I talk so openly about 

1426
01:10:50,081 --> 01:10:51,800
bombing on stage and I'd do it with 
other comedians.

1427
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:53,540
I will always want to tell people,
yeah,

1428
01:10:53,810 --> 01:10:56,180
I'm an established comedian.
I've been in community for a long time.

1429
01:10:56,181 --> 01:10:59,240
Let me tell you about like when I was 
two years in or five years in or,

1430
01:10:59,470 --> 01:11:03,020
or four years ago,
like can we tell you about some horrible

1431
01:11:03,021 --> 01:11:07,340
moments on stage where it went wrong so,
so you understand like those things took

1432
01:11:07,341 --> 01:11:12,341
me to another place because I realized I
don't want to ever feel that feeling 

1433
01:11:12,341 --> 01:11:13,410
again.
And so I ramped everything up and then I

1434
01:11:13,411 --> 01:11:16,050
went back to work and I went over my 
notebooks and I went over my,

1435
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:21,380
my recordings and I figured out what I 
was doing wrong and I tried to improve 

1436
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:21,380
upon it,
but if,

1437
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:23,460
if it wasn't for that horrible sick 
feeling,

1438
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:26,550
that's the same feeling you get when you
get tapped out in jujitsu class.

1439
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:32,120
Same feeling you geT when you lose a 
martial arts tournament or anything 

1440
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:32,120
else.
Losing is important.

1441
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:33,320
Well,
you might also say like,

1442
01:11:33,660 --> 01:11:38,660
let's say that you could pick your,
you can pick your level of competition 

1443
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:38,940
in life to some degree.
Okay,

1444
01:11:38,941 --> 01:11:41,820
so let's say you pick a level of 
competition where you're always winning.

1445
01:11:42,150 --> 01:11:42,630
It's like,
well,

1446
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:47,631
all that means is you've picked the 
wrong level of competition because you 

1447
01:11:47,631 --> 01:11:50,871
know,
like let's say you're a grand master 

1448
01:11:50,871 --> 01:11:53,480
chess player and you're.
All you do is play amateurs and every 

1449
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:56,271
night you go home and congratulate 
yourself and what a genius you are 

1450
01:11:56,271 --> 01:11:56,271
because you just stomp these people 
left,

1451
01:11:56,271 --> 01:11:56,271
right?
And center.

1452
01:11:56,271 --> 01:11:58,470
IT's like you're not a genius.
You're dimwit.

1453
01:11:58,890 --> 01:12:01,530
What you should be doing is playing 
people who are beating you like,

1454
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:03,060
well,
as much as you can tolerate.

1455
01:12:03,450 --> 01:12:06,750
So maybe that's 40 percent of the time.
Maybe it's 60 percent of the time,

1456
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:10,260
but that way because to be a winner you 
want to be disciplined.

1457
01:12:10,290 --> 01:12:15,290
You want to know what you're doing,
and then you want to be on the edge 

1458
01:12:15,290 --> 01:12:18,380
where your skills are being developed 
and if you're going to be on the edge 

1459
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:18,380
where your skills are going to be 
developed,

1460
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:20,760
you're.
You're at a place where we're lost.

1461
01:12:20,790 --> 01:12:25,790
We're losing is always a possibility 
because otherwise you're not pushing 

1462
01:12:25,790 --> 01:12:30,111
yourself beyond your current capacity,
and so one of the things that I've 

1463
01:12:30,111 --> 01:12:34,521
outlined in 12 rules for life,
this is a theory of Meaning because 

1464
01:12:34,521 --> 01:12:35,550
meaning,
as far as I'm concerned,

1465
01:12:35,551 --> 01:12:40,551
that sense of meaningful engagement is 
the antidote to malevolence and 

1466
01:12:40,551 --> 01:12:44,001
suffering essentially because you want 
to have a life that's so engaging that 

1467
01:12:44,001 --> 01:12:47,511
you think despite the fact that I'm 
limited and that we're mortal and that 

1468
01:12:47,511 --> 01:12:51,500
life is tragedy and there's evil in the 
world despite all that this is worth 

1469
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:53,970
doing,
and I think that that there's.

1470
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,610
There's a.
There's a technical meaning that,

1471
01:12:58,100 --> 01:13:03,100
that that genuinely exists and that's 
the meaning that you get when you're in 

1472
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:04,770
a domain where you have some discipline 
and some skill,

1473
01:13:04,950 --> 01:13:08,310
so you're laying out your competence and
your your ability,

1474
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:13,440
but you're simultaneously pushing 
yourself to develop past where you are.

1475
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:16,470
That's reallY engrossing and what's that
do it.

1476
01:13:16,471 --> 01:13:21,471
What did that is doing is expanding your
competence and so life is suffering and 

1477
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:22,840
betrayal in,
in,

1478
01:13:22,890 --> 01:13:27,890
in many senses of the word.
but you can adopt a way of traversing 

1479
01:13:27,890 --> 01:13:32,190
through life that is more powerful than 
the tragedy in the malevolence.

1480
01:13:32,430 --> 01:13:35,510
I agree and I say to many people that 
what?

1481
01:13:35,570 --> 01:13:40,570
What is going on in your life as you 
have a series of human reward systems 

1482
01:13:40,570 --> 01:13:44,040
that are in your body and coded in your 
body and your genetics,

1483
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:47,280
and it's the reason why human beings 
survive to 2018,

1484
01:13:47,690 --> 01:13:50,550
and in order to be happy,
you have to feed those things.

1485
01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:55,820
You have to feed all of them.
You have to feed the one that Wants to 

1486
01:13:55,820 --> 01:13:59,840
overcome difficult tasks.
You have to feed the one that wants to 

1487
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:03,291
solve problems.
You have to feed the one that wants to 

1488
01:14:03,291 --> 01:14:04,050
be with a loving tribe of people that 
you care about.

1489
01:14:04,051 --> 01:14:06,240
You have to feed the one that wants to 
procreate.

1490
01:14:06,450 --> 01:14:09,300
You have to feed all of these things.
You have to feed the love.

1491
01:14:09,301 --> 01:14:12,640
You have to feed the competition.
You have to feed the discipline,

1492
01:14:12,940 --> 01:14:16,210
and that to me is the only way to stay 
balanced or with me,

1493
01:14:16,211 --> 01:14:19,450
with my body and my mind.
That's the only way of I've been able to

1494
01:14:19,451 --> 01:14:22,690
stay balanced and when either any of 
those things get out of whack,

1495
01:14:22,870 --> 01:14:23,230
I get.

1496
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:23,970
Yeah,
well,

1497
01:14:23,971 --> 01:14:25,930
so.
So part of that is so imagine this,

1498
01:14:25,931 --> 01:14:29,520
so imagine that you're this loose 
collection of all these things that need

1499
01:14:29,521 --> 01:14:34,521
to be gratified that needed to be fed.
It's a perfectly reasonable way of 

1500
01:14:34,521 --> 01:14:34,521
looking at it biologically.
Okay,

1501
01:14:34,521 --> 01:14:39,321
so now you have to conJure up a mode of 
being that satisfies all those 

1502
01:14:39,321 --> 01:14:41,580
necessities simultaneously.
But then,

1503
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:46,720
and this is,
this is a technical explanation of why 

1504
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:49,701
the postmodernist insistence that 
there's an infinite number of 

1505
01:14:49,701 --> 01:14:53,460
explanations turns out to be wrong,
an infinite number of interpretations.

1506
01:14:53,670 --> 01:14:57,030
There's a very finite number of viable 
interpretations.

1507
01:14:57,270 --> 01:15:00,180
So the first constraint is what exactly 
what you just said.

1508
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:02,850
You have these inner demons,
let's say,

1509
01:15:02,851 --> 01:15:07,851
all of which need to be satisfied,
but they need to be satisfied in a very 

1510
01:15:07,851 --> 01:15:11,781
particular way.
Not only do they need to be satisfied 

1511
01:15:11,781 --> 01:15:12,990
today,
but they need to be satisfied today in a

1512
01:15:12,991 --> 01:15:15,570
way that doesn't interfere with 
satisfying the next week,

1513
01:15:15,571 --> 01:15:16,740
next month,
next year,

1514
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:17,520
in a decade.

1515
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:22,760
So because there's no point in you 
betraying your future self to gratify 

1516
01:15:23,461 --> 01:15:25,470
your present self,
it's a stupid game.

1517
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:30,800
Okay,
so you're constrained by the necessity 

1518
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,931
of satisfying yourself,
but of maintaining that satisfaction 

1519
01:15:32,931 --> 01:15:33,510
across time,
but then it gets even more.

1520
01:15:33,511 --> 01:15:36,630
That's hard enough,
but it's like there's an infinite number

1521
01:15:36,631 --> 01:15:41,631
of use extending indefinitely into the 
future and all of them have to be 

1522
01:15:41,631 --> 01:15:46,041
satisfied simultaneously.
But then it's worse because it isn't 

1523
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:49,041
just you.
You have to figure out how to gratify 

1524
01:15:49,041 --> 01:15:49,410
all those internal demons in a 
sustainable way,

1525
01:15:49,650 --> 01:15:52,440
in a way that other people not only 
don't object to,

1526
01:15:52,950 --> 01:15:57,330
but probably help you with and that 
benefits them at the same time.

1527
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:02,960
Well then you think you think while 
there just aren't that many ways of 

1528
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:02,960
solving that problem and we know some of
them,

1529
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:05,310
one of them is reciprocity.
You know,

1530
01:16:05,311 --> 01:16:10,311
like if you go out of your way,
for me it's incumbent on me to notice 

1531
01:16:10,311 --> 01:16:14,090
that and to attempt in some manner to,
to repay you.

1532
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:16,740
And like if,
if we're good friends,

1533
01:16:16,741 --> 01:16:19,050
that's what we'll do.
If we're a good brothers,

1534
01:16:19,051 --> 01:16:21,150
that's what we'll do.
That's what you do with your wife.

1535
01:16:21,151 --> 01:16:26,151
It's a reciprocal arrangement and that 
keeps things flowing properly across 

1536
01:16:26,151 --> 01:16:27,740
time.
So there is on,

1537
01:16:27,990 --> 01:16:32,990
there is an ethic this and this is the 
answer to the postmodern conundrums 

1538
01:16:32,990 --> 01:16:36,620
like,
well his life meaningless because 

1539
01:16:36,620 --> 01:16:38,301
everything just nihilist is nihilism.
The right answer or maybe you know the.

1540
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:43,820
What would you call identification with 
an ideology as a counter position to 

1541
01:16:43,820 --> 01:16:44,610
nihilism.
So nihilism is wrong,

1542
01:16:45,330 --> 01:16:50,330
life is meaningful.
That and that's what 12 rules for life 

1543
01:16:50,330 --> 01:16:53,391
is about.
The first meaning of life is suffering 

1544
01:16:53,391 --> 01:16:54,000
and malevolence is indisputable 
realities.

1545
01:16:54,540 --> 01:16:55,770
Okay,
well what's,

1546
01:16:55,860 --> 01:17:00,860
what's after that?
While there's a noBle way of being that 

1547
01:17:00,860 --> 01:17:03,411
allows you to exist properly despite 
that and also not to make it worse,

1548
01:17:04,740 --> 01:17:07,320
so can your life be meaningful enough so
that you.

1549
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:12,500
What is it?
Confront chaos voluntarily establishing,

1550
01:17:14,020 --> 01:17:15,370
revivify order

1551
01:17:16,810 --> 01:17:21,810
constrained malevolence.
That's a good three part doctrine for 

1552
01:17:21,911 --> 01:17:26,911
life.
There's things to do and so that's what 

1553
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:28,030
I've been talking to the audiences that 
I've been seeing over the last year.

1554
01:17:28,031 --> 01:17:30,610
It's like get your act together,
stand up forthrightly.

1555
01:17:30,611 --> 01:17:35,611
That's rule one.
Stand up straight with your shoulders 

1556
01:17:35,611 --> 01:17:35,611
back.
There's a vulnerable position,

1557
01:17:35,611 --> 01:17:35,680
right,
because you're open,

1558
01:17:36,430 --> 01:17:41,430
but it's a powerful position because it 
means that you're brave enough to take 

1559
01:17:41,430 --> 01:17:43,660
what's coming and it isn't like what's 
coming isn't dangerous.

1560
01:17:44,170 --> 01:17:46,030
It's dangerous,
so,

1561
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:51,060
but your best bet is to be dancing on 
your feet and ready for it to pay 

1562
01:17:51,060 --> 01:17:53,410
attention and be awake and to treat 
yourself property.

1563
01:17:53,411 --> 01:17:58,411
That's rule two is figuring out how to 
treat yourself as if you're soMeone 

1564
01:17:58,411 --> 01:18:00,160
worth coming to the aid of to detach 
yourself in a bit and say,

1565
01:18:00,161 --> 01:18:02,150
okay,
I'm going to set up my life so that it.

1566
01:18:02,770 --> 01:18:05,290
It's good for me and good for other 
people as well.

1567
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:09,040
As a corollary to that.
So the book is all about all about

1568
01:18:11,090 --> 01:18:13,220
the meanings of life,
the negative meanings,

1569
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:14,840
suffering,
malevolence.

1570
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:19,100
Those are indisputable realities and 
then a mode of being that integrates the

1571
01:18:19,101 --> 01:18:20,480
sorts of things that you were talking 
about,

1572
01:18:20,481 --> 01:18:24,800
these underlying needs with everyone 
else's and like doing that voluntarily.

1573
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:28,880
It's a call to responsibility and 
meaning and I actually think it's not.

1574
01:18:29,690 --> 01:18:34,690
The thing that's been so exciting for me
for the last three decades looking into 

1575
01:18:34,690 --> 01:18:38,681
these things is that I believe that 
there is a genuine human ethic.

1576
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:42,860
It's not arbitrary.
It has to do with reciprocity,

1577
01:18:42,861 --> 01:18:44,270
for exampLe,
has to do with honesty.

1578
01:18:44,271 --> 01:18:49,271
That's another thing is that you speak 
the truth because your life turns out 

1579
01:18:49,271 --> 01:18:50,360
better if you speak the truth,
and so does everyone else's.

1580
01:18:51,230 --> 01:18:53,690
So in this biblical lecture series I 
did,

1581
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:57,440
I looked at the first chapter in genesis
and there's a theory in there.

1582
01:18:57,530 --> 01:19:02,530
It's really interesting theory and the 
theory is that there's three parts to 

1583
01:19:02,530 --> 01:19:06,041
being.
There's chaos and potential and that 

1584
01:19:06,041 --> 01:19:06,740
would be like the potential you should 
live up to because everyone says,

1585
01:19:06,741 --> 01:19:08,450
well,
you should live up to your potential.

1586
01:19:08,690 --> 01:19:09,770
It's like,
what the hell is that?

1587
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:12,290
you can't measure it or touch it or 
taste it,

1588
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:17,320
feel it.
It's this hypothetical thing that 

1589
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:17,780
everyone regardless real.
it's like it's like the future.

1590
01:19:18,290 --> 01:19:20,870
What's the future?
What's not here yet?

1591
01:19:20,871 --> 01:19:23,240
You can't measure it but makes you think
it's real.

1592
01:19:23,270 --> 01:19:23,690
Well,

1593
01:19:25,990 --> 01:19:28,180
we act as if it's real and that seems to
work.

1594
01:19:28,780 --> 01:19:33,780
There's the po,
so there's potential that's one that's 

1595
01:19:33,780 --> 01:19:33,780
chaos,
chaotic potential.

1596
01:19:33,780 --> 01:19:37,860
Then there's order and that's the 
structure that you need in order to to 

1597
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:42,420
confront the chaos and and you'd be born
with that biologically and then there's 

1598
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:46,710
your ability to to call forth from the 
potential new order and that's what you 

1599
01:19:47,681 --> 01:19:49,000
do with your speech.
That's what.

1600
01:19:49,060 --> 01:19:54,060
That's what happens in the first chapter
of genesis is that god uses god order,

1601
01:19:54,131 --> 01:19:57,670
let's say,
uses the power of truthful speech.

1602
01:19:57,671 --> 01:20:02,671
That's the logos to transform potential 
into order and that's what people are 

1603
01:20:02,671 --> 01:20:04,450
made in the image of.
So there's this theory.

1604
01:20:04,451 --> 01:20:09,451
It's a lovely theory that's laid out 
right at the beginning of the that says 

1605
01:20:09,451 --> 01:20:12,621
that if you tell the truth,
you transformed the potential of being 

1606
01:20:13,650 --> 01:20:16,980
into a habitable actuality.
That's how it works.

1607
01:20:16,981 --> 01:20:17,580
So say,
well,

1608
01:20:17,581 --> 01:20:19,320
how do you want it?
how do you make the world better?

1609
01:20:19,590 --> 01:20:24,590
Tell the truth,
because the world you bring into being 

1610
01:20:24,590 --> 01:20:25,590
as a consequence of telling the truth 
will be a good world,

1611
01:20:26,130 --> 01:20:28,260
and I believe that's true.
I think it's true.

1612
01:20:28,261 --> 01:20:33,261
Metaphorically.
I think it's true theologically and I 

1613
01:20:33,261 --> 01:20:36,030
think it's true like at the practical 
and scientific level as well.

1614
01:20:36,031 --> 01:20:38,040
I think it's true in all those levels 
simultaneously.

1615
01:20:38,570 --> 01:20:41,580
That's been ridiculously exciting too to
sort through.

1616
01:20:41,990 --> 01:20:45,530
I think this notion,
and one of the things that you said that

1617
01:20:45,531 --> 01:20:50,531
I think really resonates is that there's
not a voice out there that is advocating

1618
01:20:53,121 --> 01:20:58,121
for responsibility and that is talking 
about how important this is and I think 

1619
01:20:58,121 --> 01:21:01,550
this is an inherent principle that most 
people are kind of aware of and it feels

1620
01:21:01,551 --> 01:21:04,790
good to them to hear like it resonates.
So you feel it.

1621
01:21:04,810 --> 01:21:05,370
You,
when you,

1622
01:21:05,430 --> 01:21:07,130
when you're saying this,
clean your room,

1623
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:08,480
you know,
put your house in order.

1624
01:21:08,510 --> 01:21:09,350
People like,
yeah,

1625
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:10,460
yeah,
I'll come.

1626
01:21:10,461 --> 01:21:11,550
I'm not hearing this.
Right.

1627
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:12,610
I'm not hearing them.

1628
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:17,640
Well,
it's so funny because one of the things 

1629
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:17,640
psychologists have done for the last 20 
years,

1630
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:20,260
especially the social psychologist,
has pushed this idea of self esteem.

1631
01:21:20,530 --> 01:21:22,660
You should feel good about yourself now 
I think,

1632
01:21:23,410 --> 01:21:26,010
why would you tell someone 20 that It's 
like,

1633
01:21:26,050 --> 01:21:27,520
you should feel good about who you are.
It's like,

1634
01:21:27,521 --> 01:21:28,210
no,
you shouldn't.

1635
01:21:28,630 --> 01:21:30,340
Why should you feel good about who you 
are?

1636
01:21:30,790 --> 01:21:32,860
It's like you should feel good about who
you could be.

1637
01:21:33,310 --> 01:21:38,310
That's way better because you got 60 
years to turn into who you could wait a 

1638
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:39,750
minute.
are you what your accomplishments are or

1639
01:21:39,870 --> 01:21:42,030
you descend individual going through 
this journey.

1640
01:21:42,510 --> 01:21:47,510
I mean,
I don't think there's anything wrong 

1641
01:21:47,510 --> 01:21:48,621
with feeling good about who you are as 
long as it's tempered by an 

1642
01:21:48,621 --> 01:21:52,101
understanding of potential and what you 
have accomplished versus what you can 

1643
01:21:52,101 --> 01:21:52,101
occur,

1644
01:21:52,101 --> 01:21:54,750
but having confidence is a big part in 
it is.

1645
01:21:54,751 --> 01:21:56,550
It is,
and I'm not saying that people shouldn't

1646
01:21:56,551 --> 01:21:59,670
have confidence,
but like often you take young people say

1647
01:21:59,671 --> 01:22:04,671
there are 16 to 22 and they're not 
really feeling not good about who they 

1648
01:22:04,671 --> 01:22:07,941
are because their life is chaotic and in
disorder and they don't know where 

1649
01:22:07,941 --> 01:22:08,300
they're going and they don't know which 
way is up call.

1650
01:22:08,330 --> 01:22:13,200
So that could be bad parenting.
We get to be a lot of abuse going on and

1651
01:22:13,201 --> 01:22:13,980
I think that's one of the.

1652
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:19,100
This is why that resonates with people.
This idea of be happy for you about who 

1653
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:19,100
you are.

1654
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:19,990
Right?
Feel good about who you are,

1655
01:22:20,030 --> 01:22:23,370
but but the thing is,
it has to be stated with precision.

1656
01:22:23,371 --> 01:22:24,320
It's like,
yes,

1657
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:29,360
it's like you should.
You should treat yourself as if you're 

1658
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:30,450
valuable,
especially in potential,

1659
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:33,150
but you should concentrate on who you 
should become,

1660
01:22:33,151 --> 01:22:38,151
especially if you're young,
and so let's say you're miserable and 

1661
01:22:38,151 --> 01:22:38,400
nihilistic and chaotic and depressed and
all of that now,

1662
01:22:38,401 --> 01:22:39,750
and you have your reasons,
you know,

1663
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:42,060
terrible parenting abuse,
all of those things.

1664
01:22:42,061 --> 01:22:43,110
It's like,
well,

1665
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:45,240
you should feel good about yourself.
It's like,

1666
01:22:45,241 --> 01:22:45,620
no,
no,

1667
01:22:45,630 --> 01:22:50,630
it's not.
It's not the right message is that it's 

1668
01:22:50,630 --> 01:22:54,651
more like you should understand how much
potentIal there is within you to set 

1669
01:22:54,651 --> 01:22:59,031
that straight and then you should do 
everything you can to manifest that in 

1670
01:22:59,031 --> 01:23:01,320
the world and it will set it straight 
and that's better than self esteem.

1671
01:23:01,321 --> 01:23:03,180
It's like you're,
you're in a crooked,

1672
01:23:03,181 --> 01:23:04,080
horrible position.

1673
01:23:04,170 --> 01:23:04,890
Okay,
fine.

1674
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:06,820
There's a lot of suffering and pain 
associated with that.

1675
01:23:06,910 --> 01:23:11,910
Yeah,
you can't just feel good about that 

1676
01:23:11,910 --> 01:23:11,910
because it's not good,
but you can do something about it.

1677
01:23:11,910 --> 01:23:16,710
You can genuinely do something about it,
and I think all the evidence suggests 

1678
01:23:16,710 --> 01:23:16,740
that that's the case.
Yes,

1679
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:18,460
so I'm telling,
telling young people,

1680
01:23:18,461 --> 01:23:21,100
look,
there's no Matter how bad your situation

1681
01:23:21,101 --> 01:23:23,020
is,
I'm not going to pretend it's okay.

1682
01:23:23,050 --> 01:23:24,880
It's not okay.
It's tragic,

1683
01:23:25,660 --> 01:23:30,660
tainted with malevolence,
and some people really get hurt by 

1684
01:23:30,660 --> 01:23:30,730
malevolent people like you know,
terribly hurt.

1685
01:23:30,731 --> 01:23:32,950
Sometimes they never recover.
It's really awful,

1686
01:23:33,790 --> 01:23:37,390
but there's more to you than you think,
and if you stand up and face it with,

1687
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:39,010
with a positive,
with a,

1688
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:42,160
with a noble vision,
with discipline and intent,

1689
01:23:42,850 --> 01:23:47,850
you can go far farther to overcoming it.
Then you can imagine and that's the 

1690
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:51,130
principal upon which you should 
predicate your behavior.

1691
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:56,520
And I think that one of the things 
that's really nice about being a 

1692
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:57,130
clinical psychologist is that this isn't
just guesswork.

1693
01:23:57,580 --> 01:24:00,190
Like one of the things we know,
two things in clinical psychology,

1694
01:24:00,191 --> 01:24:04,030
one is truthful conversations,
redeem people.

1695
01:24:04,690 --> 01:24:08,380
Because if you come to a clinical 
psychologist who's worth his salt,

1696
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:11,950
you have a truthful conversation.
The conversation is,

1697
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:17,600
well,
here's what's wrong with my life and 

1698
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:17,600
here's what caused it.
You know,

1699
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:21,601
maybe it takes a year to have that 
conversation and both of the 

1700
01:24:21,601 --> 01:24:22,930
participants are doing everything they 
can to lay it out properly.

1701
01:24:23,410 --> 01:24:28,410
Here's how it might be fixed,
here's what a beneficial future might 

1702
01:24:28,410 --> 01:24:31,771
look like.
And so it's a completely honest 

1703
01:24:31,771 --> 01:24:33,901
conversation if it's working well.
And all that's happening in the 

1704
01:24:33,901 --> 01:24:37,141
conversation is that the two people 
involved are trying to make things 

1705
01:24:37,141 --> 01:24:37,141
better.
That's the goal.

1706
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:40,210
Let's see if we can have a conversation 
that will make things better.

1707
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:41,860
okay?
So we know that works.

1708
01:24:41,861 --> 01:24:44,650
It does make things better.
And then another thing we know is that,

1709
01:24:45,070 --> 01:24:46,450
well,
let's say there's a bunch of things that

1710
01:24:46,451 --> 01:24:51,451
you're afraid of that are in your way.
So you have some vision about who you 

1711
01:24:51,451 --> 01:24:51,670
want to be.
Maybe you have to,

1712
01:24:51,850 --> 01:24:56,850
you know,
you want to be successful in your 

1713
01:24:56,850 --> 01:24:56,850
career,
so you have to learn to talk in front of

1714
01:24:56,850 --> 01:24:56,850
a group.
It's like,

1715
01:24:56,850 --> 01:24:58,150
okay,
well you're afraid of that,

1716
01:24:58,151 --> 01:25:00,130
so no wonder you don't want to be 
humiliated.

1717
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:01,780
So okay,
so what do we do about that?

1718
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:04,510
Well,
maybe we first get you to speak in front

1719
01:25:04,511 --> 01:25:08,290
of one person and then three people for 
five minutes and then for 10 minutes,

1720
01:25:08,291 --> 01:25:11,590
like graduated exposure to what you're 
afraid of,

1721
01:25:11,830 --> 01:25:14,950
voluntary graduated exposure to what 
you're afraid of is curative,

1722
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:17,230
and that's true.
It works.

1723
01:25:17,530 --> 01:25:18,850
That documentation is in.

1724
01:25:19,210 --> 01:25:20,470
It's how people learn,
so,

1725
01:25:21,430 --> 01:25:26,110
so to to to tell people that if you 
confront the world forthrightly,

1726
01:25:26,380 --> 01:25:31,380
if you speak the truth and you expose 
yourself courageously to those things 

1727
01:25:31,380 --> 01:25:35,431
that you're afraid of,
that your life will improve and so will 

1728
01:25:35,431 --> 01:25:35,830
the life of people around you like as 
far as I'm concerned,

1729
01:25:35,831 --> 01:25:38,590
that's as close to undeniable fact as 
we've as we've got,

1730
01:25:38,591 --> 01:25:41,680
and it also dovetails nicely with the 
underlying archetypal stories,

1731
01:25:41,681 --> 01:25:43,420
that heroic stories.
It's like go out there,

1732
01:25:43,570 --> 01:25:46,450
find the dragon confronted.
It's a dragon.

1733
01:25:46,451 --> 01:25:47,950
It might eat you.
It's dangerous,

1734
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:51,910
but it's worse to cower at home and wait
for it to come and devour you.

1735
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:54,400
Go out there confronted,
get the gold,

1736
01:25:54,820 --> 01:25:56,470
share it with the community.
It's like,

1737
01:25:56,770 --> 01:25:58,450
yeah,
it's the oldest story of mankind.

1738
01:25:58,870 --> 01:26:03,870
I think one of the factors in the 
resistance to these ideas of discipline 

1739
01:26:03,870 --> 01:26:04,100
and

1740
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:07,430
of taking responsibility for yourself 
and have a lot of the things that you've

1741
01:26:07,431 --> 01:26:09,660
been saying in regards to,
you know,

1742
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:14,740
all the things that we discussed earlier
is people recognizing that they're not 

1743
01:26:14,740 --> 01:26:18,521
doing that in their own lives and they 
get upset and instead of looking 

1744
01:26:18,521 --> 01:26:22,571
internally,
they tried to attack the thing that's 

1745
01:26:22,571 --> 01:26:23,390
upsetting them.
They attack your message,

1746
01:26:23,470 --> 01:26:28,470
they attack the philosophy behind it.
Rather than look internally and 

1747
01:26:28,470 --> 01:26:33,050
objectively and having some sort of 
introspective point of view where you 

1748
01:26:33,050 --> 01:26:33,050
go,
okay,

1749
01:26:33,050 --> 01:26:37,660
am I reacting to this because this is 
resonates like I'm missing this aspect 

1750
01:26:37,660 --> 01:26:39,260
of my life?
Is this guy does,

1751
01:26:39,290 --> 01:26:41,300
does,
does this diminish me?

1752
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:44,690
Or is this guy pointing something out 
that I can benefit from?

1753
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:49,160
Very few people are willing to do that.
Very few people are willing to take that

1754
01:26:49,161 --> 01:26:54,161
critical moment to look at their own 
behavior and look at their own thought 

1755
01:26:54,161 --> 01:26:58,331
process and wonder if the actual adverse
reaction they have to this person's 

1756
01:26:58,331 --> 01:27:00,740
message is because they know that 
they're wrong.

1757
01:27:00,970 --> 01:27:01,300
Yeah.
Well,

1758
01:27:01,301 --> 01:27:01,660
it's.
No,

1759
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:03,670
it's.
There's a couple of reasons for that.

1760
01:27:03,700 --> 01:27:05,080
One is,
well,

1761
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:09,180
what makes you think that you're someone
we should listen to me.

1762
01:27:09,220 --> 01:27:09,730
It's like,
hey,

1763
01:27:09,731 --> 01:27:10,540
fair enough.
You know,

1764
01:27:10,541 --> 01:27:12,820
so you've got to be poked a bunch to see
if that's true.

1765
01:27:13,180 --> 01:27:15,260
And then the next thing is,
um,

1766
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:21,120
well it's,
it's painful to understand how much of 

1767
01:27:21,791 --> 01:27:24,940
what you're doing isn't productive.
So I'll givE you an example.

1768
01:27:24,941 --> 01:27:28,060
So I've done this a couple of times with
classrooms full of students.

1769
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:30,340
Usually when I'm lecturing about career 
deVelopment,

1770
01:27:30,341 --> 01:27:30,910
say,
okay,

1771
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:33,580
um,
how much time do you waste?

1772
01:27:33,610 --> 01:27:37,660
So then I get the class to vote.
How many of you waste 10 hours a day?

1773
01:27:37,780 --> 01:27:39,820
It's like 10 percent of the kids that 
put up their hands.

1774
01:27:40,060 --> 01:27:43,480
And it's interesting because I don't 
define what constitutes waste.

1775
01:27:44,020 --> 01:27:47,110
I just asked the question.
So they're diagnosing themselves,

1776
01:27:47,111 --> 01:27:47,350
right?

1777
01:27:47,350 --> 01:27:49,510
I'm not saying you're wasting 10 hours a
day,

1778
01:27:49,990 --> 01:27:53,290
I'm just asking.
It's like given your own attitude,

1779
01:27:53,620 --> 01:27:55,570
how much time you're wasting 10 hours a 
day.

1780
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,490
It's like 10 percent of the people put 
up their hands.

1781
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:00,250
Well,
when you get to like six hours a day,

1782
01:28:00,340 --> 01:28:02,080
80 percent of the people put up their 
hands,

1783
01:28:02,470 --> 01:28:07,470
so then we do the arithmetic.
It's because I like doing arithmetic 

1784
01:28:07,470 --> 01:28:07,470
with people.
People hate arithmetic,

1785
01:28:07,470 --> 01:28:08,230
but I like doing it.
It's like,

1786
01:28:08,231 --> 01:28:09,880
okay,
six hours a day,

1787
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:12,790
42 hours a week,
so let's call that a work week,

1788
01:28:12,791 --> 01:28:14,590
40 hours a week.
So,

1789
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:16,480
so that's,
that's a work week.

1790
01:28:16,690 --> 01:28:19,210
Let's say what's your time worth,
your university student?

1791
01:28:19,530 --> 01:28:22,180
Or certainly worth minimum wage because 
obviously,

1792
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:27,360
but it's worth way more than that 
because if you spend a productive hour 

1793
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:30,961
when you're 20 than you gain the 
benefits of that hour for the rest of 

1794
01:28:30,961 --> 01:28:30,961
your life.

1795
01:28:30,961 --> 01:28:33,520
So there's the compounding effect of 
time spent when we were young.

1796
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:34,300
So I say,
well,

1797
01:28:34,301 --> 01:28:36,460
let's assume your time is worth 50 bucks
an hour,

1798
01:28:36,700 --> 01:28:38,410
which I think is an underestimate,
but whatever.

1799
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:40,270
Let's call it 50.
We call it 25,

1800
01:28:40,271 --> 01:28:42,460
but we'll call it 50.
That's $2,000

1801
01:28:42,461 --> 01:28:45,160
a week.
You're wasting $100,000

1802
01:28:45,161 --> 01:28:46,650
a year.
It's like,

1803
01:28:46,750 --> 01:28:50,500
how much better would your life be if 
you weren't wasting $100,000

1804
01:28:50,501 --> 01:28:52,330
a year?
It's like,

1805
01:28:52,331 --> 01:28:53,740
what is that?
Over 40 years,

1806
01:28:54,610 --> 01:28:56,560
$4,000,000.
It's like you're rich.

1807
01:28:56,890 --> 01:29:01,890
You don't even know it.
Quit wasting time by your own 

1808
01:29:01,890 --> 01:29:03,360
definition.
It's like people shake their heads like,

1809
01:29:03,361 --> 01:29:04,410
oh,
I never thought about it that way.

1810
01:29:04,411 --> 01:29:05,070
It's like,
yeah,

1811
01:29:05,730 --> 01:29:08,280
think about it that way.
Don't waste your damn life.

1812
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:09,510
And then you think,
well,

1813
01:29:09,511 --> 01:29:11,370
why would people be resistant to that 
message?

1814
01:29:11,371 --> 01:29:11,940
It's like,
well,

1815
01:29:12,450 --> 01:29:17,450
you really want to wake up and figure 
out that you're wasting half your life 

1816
01:29:17,450 --> 01:29:18,720
and you know,
when people do that kind of wasting,

1817
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:20,010
they actually hate it.

1818
01:29:20,370 --> 01:29:25,370
You know,
and I've had lots of people come to my 

1819
01:29:25,370 --> 01:29:25,370
clinical practice who were chronic 
procrastinators,

1820
01:29:25,370 --> 01:29:29,980
you know,
and so they're watching youtube videos 

1821
01:29:29,980 --> 01:29:29,980
say,
but,

1822
01:29:29,980 --> 01:29:32,220
but not ones that are good for them,
although sometimes they will do that,

1823
01:29:32,221 --> 01:29:36,330
but just browsing in that kind of 
mindless way that you do when you're not

1824
01:29:36,331 --> 01:29:40,140
paying attention and you're trying to 
kill time and people doing that,

1825
01:29:40,141 --> 01:29:42,060
they feel bad,
they get depressed,

1826
01:29:42,061 --> 01:29:44,070
they feel anxious,
they can't get away from it.

1827
01:29:44,071 --> 01:29:47,490
They feel kind of [inaudible] addicted.
Do saying about social media now.

1828
01:29:47,491 --> 01:29:49,800
It's a huge issue with young kids.
Absolutely,

1829
01:29:49,950 --> 01:29:54,950
but there's this feeling of kind of 
internal wrought and corruption that 

1830
01:29:54,950 --> 01:29:54,950
goes along with it.
It's like,

1831
01:29:54,950 --> 01:29:55,830
yeah,
well you're wasting your life.

1832
01:29:56,220 --> 01:29:57,570
It's like,
so it's painful.

1833
01:29:57,900 --> 01:30:01,020
It's painful to recognize that.
Then it's painful to think,

1834
01:30:01,050 --> 01:30:03,780
oh my god,
look how undisciplined I am.

1835
01:30:04,470 --> 01:30:07,200
I don't know anything.
I can't use a schedule.

1836
01:30:07,260 --> 01:30:09,000
I can't,
I can't stick to a calendar.

1837
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:12,120
I don't have any aims.
I don't know anything about the world.

1838
01:30:12,630 --> 01:30:17,630
Right.
And maybe there's a part of me that's 

1839
01:30:17,630 --> 01:30:17,850
bitter because I haven't got everything 
already and I'd just like to say to hell

1840
01:30:17,851 --> 01:30:22,851
with it.
That's the recognition of the union 

1841
01:30:22,851 --> 01:30:24,861
shadow.
So like that's what makes you a vicious 

1842
01:30:24,861 --> 01:30:24,861
and,
and,

1843
01:30:24,861 --> 01:30:25,410
and,
and untrustworthy all of that.

1844
01:30:25,470 --> 01:30:28,080
No one wants to look at that and no 
bloody wonder.

1845
01:30:28,950 --> 01:30:32,070
But hey,
the alternative is worse.

1846
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:37,210
So the problem is you say like just 
saying stop wasting your life.

1847
01:30:37,290 --> 01:30:42,290
Like I think that that's not enough.
I think this is one of the reasons why a

1848
01:30:42,641 --> 01:30:47,641
book like this is so important.
Like the idea of discipline and most 

1849
01:30:47,641 --> 01:30:49,690
people's eyes is like,
if you're not a disciplined person,

1850
01:30:50,170 --> 01:30:53,650
it's uncomfortable.
It's going to be painful.

1851
01:30:53,830 --> 01:30:58,830
It's frustrating.
You have to force yourself into these 

1852
01:30:58,830 --> 01:30:59,140
things.
It's a muscle.

1853
01:30:59,460 --> 01:31:00,950
It's a muscle that it has to be 
developed.

1854
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,770
These patterns have to be developed in 
your own mind.

1855
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:04,990
Yes.

1856
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:06,170
Yeah.
Well with,

1857
01:31:06,171 --> 01:31:07,860
uh,
so you're right,

1858
01:31:07,861 --> 01:31:10,080
just telling people not to waste their 
lives is not enough.

1859
01:31:10,081 --> 01:31:15,081
And this is another reason why I've so 
much enjoyed being a clinical 

1860
01:31:15,081 --> 01:31:17,991
psychologist because clinical 
psychologists don't stick with high 

1861
01:31:17,991 --> 01:31:19,920
level abstractions,
especially the behaviors.

1862
01:31:19,921 --> 01:31:20,970
They're really practical.
It's like,

1863
01:31:20,971 --> 01:31:22,170
okay,
you want to get your act together.

1864
01:31:22,171 --> 01:31:22,680
It's like,
well,

1865
01:31:22,860 --> 01:31:26,730
how about if let's say you're not 
studying well,

1866
01:31:26,731 --> 01:31:28,770
and so we do a real analysis of how much
you're studying.

1867
01:31:28,771 --> 01:31:29,100
You say,
well,

1868
01:31:29,101 --> 01:31:30,750
I go to the library for hours a day.
It's like,

1869
01:31:30,751 --> 01:31:31,200
yeah,
yeah.

1870
01:31:31,201 --> 01:31:36,201
Okay.
How much time do you actually study in 

1871
01:31:36,201 --> 01:31:36,201
the library?
Well,

1872
01:31:36,201 --> 01:31:36,330
you know,
I waste time.

1873
01:31:36,331 --> 01:31:39,000
I have to travel there.
I look at my phone,

1874
01:31:39,001 --> 01:31:39,540
it's like,
okay,

1875
01:31:39,541 --> 01:31:41,430
well how much?
Fifteen minutes,

1876
01:31:41,610 --> 01:31:43,410
half an hour.
How much is real studying?

1877
01:31:43,860 --> 01:31:45,720
While maybe we figure out it's 15 
minutes,

1878
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:46,320
say,
okay,

1879
01:31:46,321 --> 01:31:51,321
so what are you going to do for one week
is you're going to study for half an 

1880
01:31:51,321 --> 01:31:51,321
hour.

1881
01:31:51,321 --> 01:31:55,190
That's all.
You don't get to go to the library for 

1882
01:31:55,190 --> 01:31:57,231
four hours,
you have to sit down and we'll figure 

1883
01:31:57,231 --> 01:31:57,231
out a time,
10:00

1884
01:31:57,231 --> 01:31:57,231
in the morning,
whatever.

1885
01:31:57,231 --> 01:32:01,251
We'll put it in your schedule,
try to study for an hour no more and 

1886
01:32:01,251 --> 01:32:05,671
then just come back and let's have a 
conversation about how well that worked 

1887
01:32:05,671 --> 01:32:05,671
and people will come back and they say,
well,

1888
01:32:05,671 --> 01:32:07,750
you know,
I managed it for days and one day I went

1889
01:32:07,751 --> 01:32:09,520
over and one day I couldn't do it at 
all.

1890
01:32:09,521 --> 01:32:10,120
It's like,
okay,

1891
01:32:10,180 --> 01:32:13,900
that's better.
Instead of 75 minutes of studying,

1892
01:32:14,350 --> 01:32:16,510
you know,
15 minutes a day for seven days,

1893
01:32:16,511 --> 01:32:17,440
what is that?
15,

1894
01:32:17,450 --> 01:32:19,510
7,105
minutes.

1895
01:32:19,660 --> 01:32:24,660
You've managed about 210 minutes,
so you've already produced an 

1896
01:32:24,660 --> 01:32:25,030
improvement of 50 percent and your 
bumbling,

1897
01:32:25,031 --> 01:32:30,031
horrible way.
You've got a 50 percent improvement in 

1898
01:32:30,031 --> 01:32:30,031
one week.
It's like that's deadly.

1899
01:32:30,031 --> 01:32:32,500
It's like so in the future authoring 
program,

1900
01:32:33,250 --> 01:32:37,000
what we ask people to do is we'll think 
about your life along six dimensions.

1901
01:32:37,990 --> 01:32:40,060
What do you want for your,
so the goal is this,

1902
01:32:40,061 --> 01:32:45,061
you're going to take care of yourself,
you're going to have a life in three 

1903
01:32:45,061 --> 01:32:45,640
years that justifies its suffering.
That's the goal,

1904
01:32:45,700 --> 01:32:50,700
so you can invent the damn life,
but you have to think what you would be 

1905
01:32:50,700 --> 01:32:50,980
satisfied with so you wouldn't be all 
bitter and resentful.

1906
01:32:51,310 --> 01:32:51,880
It's like,
okay,

1907
01:32:52,180 --> 01:32:55,420
what do you want from your family?
What do you want from your friends?

1908
01:32:56,640 --> 01:32:59,080
How are you going to educate yourself?
What do you want for your career?

1909
01:32:59,110 --> 01:33:00,670
How are you going to use your time 
outside of work?

1910
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:03,310
How are you going to handle drugs and 
alcohol and other temptations like that?

1911
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:05,530
How are we going to keep yourself 
mentally and physically healthy?

1912
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:08,730
These are open questions like you get to
answer the.

1913
01:33:09,340 --> 01:33:11,320
The idea is you can have whatever you 
want,

1914
01:33:12,280 --> 01:33:13,510
but you have to figure out what it is.

1915
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:15,670
It has to be realistic and you have to 
figure out what it is.

1916
01:33:16,050 --> 01:33:17,410
So okay,
so now develop a vision.

1917
01:33:17,411 --> 01:33:19,300
What's your life going to be like in 
three to five years,

1918
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:21,670
so we write it down.
Then we do something else,

1919
01:33:21,671 --> 01:33:22,300
which is,
okay,

1920
01:33:22,301 --> 01:33:26,920
I'm your bad habits and your resentment 
and your bitterness and all of that.

1921
01:33:26,921 --> 01:33:30,850
Your procrastination gets completely out
of hand and you auger down and you're in

1922
01:33:30,851 --> 01:33:33,190
your own personal version of hell in 
three to five years.

1923
01:33:33,970 --> 01:33:35,280
What does that look like?
Well,

1924
01:33:35,340 --> 01:33:40,340
everyone knows that.
It'S like everyone can look into the 

1925
01:33:40,340 --> 01:33:40,340
future and think,
well,

1926
01:33:40,340 --> 01:33:42,460
if I keep going on this dark path,
this is where I'll end up.

1927
01:33:42,940 --> 01:33:47,940
Well then you've got little hail outline
for yourself to run away from and you 

1928
01:33:47,940 --> 01:33:51,220
got a little heaven outline for yourself
to run towards and then you're motivated

1929
01:33:51,670 --> 01:33:54,130
because sometimes you know,
you're just hopeful.

1930
01:33:54,190 --> 01:33:55,960
I would like a good thing to happen.
It's like,

1931
01:33:56,140 --> 01:33:56,880
yeah,
but you know,

1932
01:33:56,890 --> 01:33:58,900
I'd like to drink half a bottle of 
whiskey tonight too.

1933
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:00,970
It's like,
so which is it going to be?

1934
01:34:01,780 --> 01:34:06,780
Well,
just being hopeful about the future 

1935
01:34:06,780 --> 01:34:06,780
might not be enough,
but then you think,

1936
01:34:06,780 --> 01:34:06,780
oh,
I see.

1937
01:34:06,780 --> 01:34:11,430
Like there's that little health thing 
that I outlined this waiting for me and 

1938
01:34:11,430 --> 01:34:15,271
maybe I'm afraid of taking the next step
forward because it's demanding and 

1939
01:34:15,271 --> 01:34:15,271
challenging.
It's like,

1940
01:34:15,271 --> 01:34:15,580
yeah,
I'm afraid of that,

1941
01:34:15,581 --> 01:34:20,581
but I'm way more afraid of where I might
end up if I don't get my act together 

1942
01:34:20,581 --> 01:34:22,690
and people should be.
That's why their conceptions of hell and

1943
01:34:22,691 --> 01:34:25,720
so many religions,
it's like hell is a real place.

1944
01:34:26,410 --> 01:34:28,750
Whether it's eternal.
That's a whole different question.

1945
01:34:28,870 --> 01:34:30,850
Whether it's waiting for you in the 
afterlife.

1946
01:34:30,851 --> 01:34:33,820
That's a whole different question,
but if you'Ve never met anyone in hell,

1947
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,820
you haven't lived very long.
You haven't had your eyes open.

1948
01:34:36,930 --> 01:34:38,530
Yeah.
It's undeniable the,

1949
01:34:38,540 --> 01:34:41,170
the,
the feeling of total complete misery.

1950
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:42,140
Undeniable.
Yeah.

1951
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:45,340
Especially when it's compounded by the 
fact that you know,

1952
01:34:45,341 --> 01:34:47,710
you did it to yourself.
That's real fun.

1953
01:34:47,711 --> 01:34:52,711
That's the real fun part.
It's like I'm having a bitch of a time 

1954
01:34:52,711 --> 01:34:53,140
and I richly deserve it.
Jesus,

1955
01:34:53,141 --> 01:34:53,980
that's rough,
man.

1956
01:34:53,990 --> 01:34:57,920
This is another concept that is doesn't 
have a right now.

1957
01:34:58,100 --> 01:34:59,930
This is another.
I mean,

1958
01:34:59,931 --> 01:35:04,931
this is a giant part of being human 
being and instead of identity politics 

1959
01:35:04,931 --> 01:35:06,980
and right versus left,
I think these,

1960
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:11,130
these right versus left battles 
oftentimes what they are as a simply the

1961
01:35:11,290 --> 01:35:13,820
battle ground for the conflicts in your 
own mind.

1962
01:35:13,950 --> 01:35:14,670
Yep,
yep.

1963
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:18,300
Better to have the conflict in yourself.
That's another thing I really learned.

1964
01:35:18,330 --> 01:35:20,430
Well,
not not only from the new testament,

1965
01:35:20,431 --> 01:35:22,110
but a fair bit from that.
No.

1966
01:35:22,111 --> 01:35:23,880
The idea is that,
well,

1967
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:29,600
there's evil in the world of all sorts 
and some of it's evil and other people 

1968
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:32,340
and some of it's the evil in your 
brother's heart,

1969
01:35:32,700 --> 01:35:37,700
but the part of it that you can really 
do something about that's the 

1970
01:35:37,700 --> 01:35:39,120
malevolence in your own heart.
You can actually do something about that

1971
01:35:39,150 --> 01:35:41,520
and that's actually way more useful than
you think,

1972
01:35:42,210 --> 01:35:47,210
so because if you can face it in you,
then you start to understand it and that

1973
01:35:47,401 --> 01:35:50,070
also makes you strong enough to identify
it and to fight it.

1974
01:35:50,071 --> 01:35:52,860
When you see it in the external world,
plus you don't do any harm.

1975
01:35:53,420 --> 01:35:58,420
It's like like there's lots of people 
all over the world going out and doing 

1976
01:35:58,420 --> 01:35:58,420
reprehensible things and you might say,
well,

1977
01:35:58,420 --> 01:36:00,540
you should go out and protest against 
them like then sometimes you should,

1978
01:36:01,230 --> 01:36:05,520
but most of the time you should think,
where am I falling short of the ideal,

1979
01:36:05,580 --> 01:36:06,450
my own ideal.

1980
01:36:06,590 --> 01:36:08,370
It doesn't have to be one that someone 
puts on you.

1981
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,520
Where am I less than I should be?
Where am I bitter?

1982
01:36:11,610 --> 01:36:14,070
Where am I making the world a worse 
place than it has to be?

1983
01:36:14,790 --> 01:36:17,970
Like you ask yourself those questions.
You'll be in for a big shock to say,

1984
01:36:17,971 --> 01:36:22,971
well,
what would happen if you stopped doing 

1985
01:36:22,971 --> 01:36:22,971
that?
That's what 12 rules for life is about.

1986
01:36:22,971 --> 01:36:23,820
It's like stop saying things that make 
you weak.

1987
01:36:24,240 --> 01:36:27,090
Stop telling lies that you know to be 
lies,

1988
01:36:27,450 --> 01:36:30,180
stopped doing things you know,
to be useless and counterproductive.

1989
01:36:30,750 --> 01:36:35,750
Aim high dobson responsibility and then 
see what the hell happens so I can work 

1990
01:36:36,690 --> 01:36:38,160
and that's what I'm hoping people will 
do.

1991
01:36:38,850 --> 01:36:40,560
Yeah,
I'm hoping people will do that too.

1992
01:36:40,561 --> 01:36:45,510
And I think if more people live their 
life in this sort of a manner,

1993
01:36:45,511 --> 01:36:50,511
I think we're going to have less 
differences in terms of our ideologies 

1994
01:36:50,511 --> 01:36:52,140
and more of an understanding that people
have different ways of looking at things

1995
01:36:52,141 --> 01:36:56,760
in different ways of living and this,
this combat between people,

1996
01:36:56,910 --> 01:37:01,910
this,
this internal strife that manifests 

1997
01:37:01,910 --> 01:37:03,090
itself in this combat between 
ideologies.

1998
01:37:03,630 --> 01:37:08,630
I think you are much more inclined to 
let other people live their lives if 

1999
01:37:08,630 --> 01:37:10,080
you're living your life in a 
satisfactory manner.

2000
01:37:10,110 --> 01:37:12,060
That that's exactly it.
That's that.

2001
01:37:12,090 --> 01:37:13,320
I have a chapter in there

2002
01:37:13,490 --> 01:37:15,920
raising kids says,
don't like your kids.

2003
01:37:15,921 --> 01:37:17,960
Don't let your kids do anything.
It makes you dislike them.

2004
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:19,160
It's like,
well,

2005
01:37:19,161 --> 01:37:24,161
that's first predicated on the 
observation that you're quite a monster 

2006
01:37:24,161 --> 01:37:24,680
and it would be better for your kids if 
they didn't get on your bad side.

2007
01:37:25,310 --> 01:37:27,560
And again,
because I'm a clinical psychologist

2008
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:28,560
monster.
Why?

2009
01:37:28,561 --> 01:37:29,760
Why?
Why do you use that term?

2010
01:37:29,850 --> 01:37:34,850
Because I've watched families,
like I've seen families where it's as if

2011
01:37:34,951 --> 01:37:39,951
every single person in the family has 
their hands around the neck of the 

2012
01:37:39,951 --> 01:37:41,250
family member that's close to them and 
they're squeezing.

2013
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:43,830
But only tight enough to strangle the 
been 20 years.

2014
01:37:43,890 --> 01:37:45,780
But you're not always using it as a 
pejorative.

2015
01:37:45,781 --> 01:37:46,260
You,
you,

2016
01:37:46,261 --> 01:37:48,690
you've also used it.
You should become a monster.

2017
01:37:48,691 --> 01:37:50,280
You should be a monster.
Yeah.

2018
01:37:50,281 --> 01:37:51,330
But that's.

2019
01:37:52,840 --> 01:37:54,820
You shouldn't be.
It shouldn't be accidental.

2020
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:57,010
That's the thing.
What?

2021
01:37:57,080 --> 01:37:59,580
So what do you mean by monster then?
In a positive sense?

2022
01:37:59,610 --> 01:38:00,960
Like you should be a monster.
Oh,

2023
01:38:00,961 --> 01:38:01,920
that's easy.
Amman,

2024
01:38:01,940 --> 01:38:04,470
a positive monster is somebody who says 
no and means it.

2025
01:38:05,430 --> 01:38:08,640
Because when you say know what you mean 
is there isn't anything you can do to me

2026
01:38:08,641 --> 01:38:11,010
that will make me agree to do this.
Why is that a monster?

2027
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:13,680
Because you have to be because no one 
will take you seriously.

2028
01:38:13,681 --> 01:38:16,170
Otherwise no one will take you 
seriously.

2029
01:38:16,171 --> 01:38:21,171
Like no means if you keep pushing this 
something that you do not like will 

2030
01:38:21,691 --> 01:38:23,580
happen to you.
That's what no means.

2031
01:38:23,850 --> 01:38:26,670
You don't have any strength of character
unless you can put up a fight,

2032
01:38:27,210 --> 01:38:29,160
you know?
And to be able to say no to something is

2033
01:38:29,161 --> 01:38:32,100
to be able to put up a fight.
So when you can't do that,

2034
01:38:32,101 --> 01:38:33,720
if you're,
if you can be pushed around,

2035
01:38:34,050 --> 01:38:39,050
you'll just get argued into submission 
or you'll feel guilty because you're 

2036
01:38:39,050 --> 01:38:39,060
causing conflict or something like that.

2037
01:38:39,110 --> 01:38:41,550
But isn't there confusion using those 
terms as a positive,

2038
01:38:41,650 --> 01:38:42,870
as a negative?
Maybe there's another

2039
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:45,780
word instead of monster.
Well there is.

2040
01:38:45,810 --> 01:38:48,450
There is the potential.
There is the potential for confusion.

2041
01:38:48,451 --> 01:38:48,870
You say,
well,

2042
01:38:48,871 --> 01:38:50,860
is that something that can be 
[inaudible]?

2043
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:51,170
I think that

2044
01:38:51,230 --> 01:38:56,230
monster is a horrible thing.
I don't think of it as being like a 

2045
01:38:56,230 --> 01:38:59,681
wall,
like someone who is just rock solid in 

2046
01:38:59,681 --> 01:39:01,070
their belief system and rock solid and

2047
01:39:01,470 --> 01:39:05,760
their understanding of when you fight 
someone who's formidable say what do you

2048
01:39:05,761 --> 01:39:07,260
think of the person that you're 
fighting?

2049
01:39:07,261 --> 01:39:12,261
Like how would you characterize them?
They may have a monster side because 

2050
01:39:12,261 --> 01:39:12,390
they can take,
they can,

2051
01:39:12,660 --> 01:39:17,660
they can bring physical,
substantial physical force to bear on 

2052
01:39:18,691 --> 01:39:23,691
the situation and and be willing to do 
it so they're not naive and and harmless

2053
01:39:24,991 --> 01:39:26,670
by any stretch of the imagination.
Right?

2054
01:39:26,671 --> 01:39:28,800
They have a well developed capacity for 
mayhem.

2055
01:39:30,230 --> 01:39:30,740
You think,
well,

2056
01:39:30,741 --> 01:39:32,010
is that monstrous?
It's like,

2057
01:39:32,011 --> 01:39:35,280
well,
I would say yes,

2058
01:39:35,490 --> 01:39:37,530
I would say fierce.
Fierce,

2059
01:39:37,531 --> 01:39:38,730
fine,
let's go with that.

2060
01:39:38,870 --> 01:39:43,870
Yeah.
Because someone who's fierce and 

2061
01:39:43,870 --> 01:39:43,970
formidable,
it's not necessarily a monster,

2062
01:39:44,650 --> 01:39:49,650
you know,
just I think of a monster as being just 

2063
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:49,650
an awful person who's done awful things 
and just,

2064
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:49,700
you know.

2065
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:50,890
Okay,
well,

2066
01:39:50,891 --> 01:39:52,000
so be fair,
fair enough.

2067
01:39:52,030 --> 01:39:57,030
Well,
so back to tHe back to the issue 

2068
01:39:57,030 --> 01:39:58,770
situation with your kids while you 
definitely don't want to have your kids 

2069
01:39:58,770 --> 01:39:59,500
act in a way that awakens your inner 
monster,

2070
01:40:00,070 --> 01:40:02,230
let's put it that way.
And so you need to.

2071
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:07,560
You need to organize your family with a 
certain amount of discipline and a 

2072
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:09,370
certain amount of structure so that you 
get to do what you want,

2073
01:40:09,371 --> 01:40:13,570
which is back to back to the point that 
you made earlier so that you're happy to

2074
01:40:13,571 --> 01:40:16,210
have your kids around so that you won't 
take revenge on them.

2075
01:40:16,750 --> 01:40:21,520
and so you want to lay your life out so 
that well,

2076
01:40:21,670 --> 01:40:26,670
so that it's providing you what you need
to not be bitter and to work for your 

2077
01:40:27,491 --> 01:40:30,010
best interests and for the interests of 
everyone else.

2078
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:32,380
That would be lovely and I think it's 
attainable,

2079
01:40:32,950 --> 01:40:37,950
you know,
because the book is very dark and I'm a 

2080
01:40:37,950 --> 01:40:40,680
very dark guy in some ways because I've 
looked at the terrible things that 

2081
01:40:40,680 --> 01:40:40,680
people do to one another.
That's

2082
01:40:40,680 --> 01:40:45,350
a fascinating way of looking at.
If you think you're yourself as dark 

2083
01:40:45,350 --> 01:40:45,360
because I don't think of you as dark.
Oh,

2084
01:40:45,361 --> 01:40:47,940
that's good.
You seem very friendly guy.

2085
01:40:48,030 --> 01:40:50,700
I think you're.
You're very serious and especially about

2086
01:40:50,701 --> 01:40:55,701
these very complicated issues and I 
think that's one of the reasons why you 

2087
01:40:55,701 --> 01:41:00,091
have made this gigantic wave in online 
discourse.

2088
01:41:02,240 --> 01:41:07,240
People discussing these very tumultuous 
times that we live in is because you're 

2089
01:41:07,240 --> 01:41:12,061
a guy that did extrapolate.
Your guy did look at that [inaudible] 

2090
01:41:12,061 --> 01:41:14,770
bill and look at marxism and go,
do you know where this is headed?

2091
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:19,050
And you were the guy that had the 
courage to say murderous and,

2092
01:41:19,190 --> 01:41:21,430
and people are like,
what the fuck is he talking about?

2093
01:41:21,431 --> 01:41:26,431
That doesn't make any sense.
And you had to spell it out and explain 

2094
01:41:26,431 --> 01:41:29,911
it.
And when you do you realize why this is 

2095
01:41:29,911 --> 01:41:30,160
so significant to you?

2096
01:41:30,710 --> 01:41:30,980
Yeah.
Well,

2097
01:41:30,981 --> 01:41:35,981
the,
the tRibalism issue that you were 

2098
01:41:35,981 --> 01:41:35,981
discussing earlier,
it doesn't seem to be all of that.

2099
01:41:35,981 --> 01:41:40,840
What would you say?
Debatable that if we degenerate into 

2100
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:44,861
tribalism,
the probability of bloodshed becomes 

2101
01:41:44,861 --> 01:41:44,861
vastly enhanced.
IT's like,

2102
01:41:44,861 --> 01:41:49,241
well,
that always happens when people devolve 

2103
01:41:49,241 --> 01:41:49,241
into tribalism.
So,

2104
01:41:49,241 --> 01:41:49,520
and I'm pointing to a particular kind of
tribalism.

2105
01:41:49,850 --> 01:41:51,690
I guess the darkness is that,
you know,

2106
01:41:51,770 --> 01:41:56,420
I'm Very aware of the terrible things 
that people not only are likely to do to

2107
01:41:56,421 --> 01:41:57,250
each other,
but do,

2108
01:41:57,251 --> 01:41:59,210
do to each other all the time.
I mean,

2109
01:41:59,211 --> 01:42:01,550
what?
It's about 40 percent for divorce rate.

2110
01:42:01,551 --> 01:42:06,551
Right?
But you to go through a fairly fair bit 

2111
01:42:06,551 --> 01:42:06,650
of ugliness to get to divorce.

2112
01:42:06,780 --> 01:42:10,110
Canadians are nicer than americans.
Maybe you guys are 40 percent maybe.

2113
01:42:10,340 --> 01:42:15,340
Maybe.
I think it's fairly similar to the 

2114
01:42:15,340 --> 01:42:15,690
present.
I think actually it's 50 percent here,

2115
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:17,390
somewhere on that one,
but yeah.

2116
01:42:17,450 --> 01:42:18,980
Yeah,
you have to go through a lot.

2117
01:42:19,010 --> 01:42:21,550
That's really ugly to,
you know,

2118
01:42:21,570 --> 01:42:23,940
and chris rock had a joke about that and
he's like,

2119
01:42:23,941 --> 01:42:26,340
50 percent of people get divorced.
He goes,

2120
01:42:26,650 --> 01:42:27,150
hey.
He goes,

2121
01:42:27,151 --> 01:42:29,220
but that's just the people who had the 
courage to leave.

2122
01:42:29,221 --> 01:42:32,100
He goes,
how many cowards just stay and suffer,

2123
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:36,510
and meanwhile he wound up getting 
divorced a few years later.

2124
01:42:36,570 --> 01:42:38,370
Right.
Horrible divorce.

2125
01:42:38,760 --> 01:42:41,070
So yeah.
True story.

2126
01:42:41,130 --> 01:42:42,200
Yeah,
yeah,

2127
01:42:43,020 --> 01:42:44,430
yeah.
But it's a good point.

2128
01:42:44,970 --> 01:42:47,040
Yeah.
I think,

2129
01:42:47,041 --> 01:42:52,041
um,
we need more people who were actualized 

2130
01:42:52,141 --> 01:42:57,141
human beings,
more and more people who understand 

2131
01:42:57,141 --> 01:42:59,541
themselves,
more people who have gone through 

2132
01:42:59,541 --> 01:43:02,480
adversity both in real life and personal
in terms of their understanding of their

2133
01:43:03,241 --> 01:43:08,241
own growth,
of their own potential and their own 

2134
01:43:08,241 --> 01:43:09,270
understanding of how they've managed 
their life,

2135
01:43:09,271 --> 01:43:10,320
their mind,
their,

2136
01:43:10,740 --> 01:43:15,740
their actions.
And the more we have people that have 

2137
01:43:15,740 --> 01:43:20,541
personal sovereignty,
the better we'll be able to have these 

2138
01:43:20,541 --> 01:43:20,541
conversations.

2139
01:43:20,541 --> 01:43:21,330
Well that,
that'd be the hope.

2140
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:26,360
You know,
one of the things I've been suggesting 

2141
01:43:26,360 --> 01:43:26,910
to people is that they pick something 
difficult to do.

2142
01:43:27,300 --> 01:43:30,450
I rEad this is funny,
little paragraph by kierkegaard.

2143
01:43:30,451 --> 01:43:34,080
It was written in about 1840 and he was 
thinking about his role as a student and

2144
01:43:34,081 --> 01:43:35,880
writer and he was a student in writer 
forever,

2145
01:43:35,881 --> 01:43:40,881
you know,
he never really had a career apart from 

2146
01:43:40,881 --> 01:43:43,851
that.
And he said that he wasn't one of these 

2147
01:43:43,851 --> 01:43:46,311
people who was capable of inventing 
something wonderful to make life easier 

2148
01:43:46,311 --> 01:43:48,390
for everyone.
Like so many people were doing it during

2149
01:43:48,391 --> 01:43:49,710
the industrial revolution.
He said,

2150
01:43:49,711 --> 01:43:54,711
well,
maybe I'm one of these whose benefit to 

2151
01:43:54,711 --> 01:43:57,791
society will be that I will make things 
more difficult for everyone because 

2152
01:43:57,791 --> 01:43:58,940
there will come a time when what people 
want not.

2153
01:43:59,570 --> 01:44:01,940
They don't want ease,
they want difficulty instead.

2154
01:44:02,210 --> 01:44:02,840
And I think,
well,

2155
01:44:02,841 --> 01:44:03,830
that is what people want.

2156
01:44:04,670 --> 01:44:05,930
That is what they want.
You think,

2157
01:44:05,931 --> 01:44:06,710
well,
I want an easy,

2158
01:44:06,711 --> 01:44:07,640
happy life.
It's like,

2159
01:44:07,641 --> 01:44:12,641
no,
actually that isn't what you want a see 

2160
01:44:12,641 --> 01:44:13,070
wonderful bond is things that are 
difficult that they can overcome.

2161
01:44:13,190 --> 01:44:13,700
Yeah,
right.

2162
01:44:13,701 --> 01:44:18,701
That's right.
They want an optimal challenge as a 

2163
01:44:18,701 --> 01:44:18,701
whole different thing when you overcome 
something,

2164
01:44:18,701 --> 01:44:20,300
when you do something difficult,
whether it's.

2165
01:44:20,540 --> 01:44:21,410
I mean,
I've never written a book,

2166
01:44:21,411 --> 01:44:23,960
but I assume when you write a book,
when you're done writing that book,

2167
01:44:23,961 --> 01:44:28,961
there's a great feeling of 
accomplishment because it's very 

2168
01:44:28,961 --> 01:44:29,350
difficult to do that feeling of 
accomplished.

2169
01:44:29,360 --> 01:44:34,360
For me,
it's like when I put together a comedy 

2170
01:44:34,360 --> 01:44:34,360
special or when I,
you know,

2171
01:44:34,360 --> 01:44:36,380
just anything that's difficult,
there's a feeling like I did it.

2172
01:44:36,730 --> 01:44:37,820
Yeah.
Yeah.

2173
01:44:37,821 --> 01:44:40,010
Well,
one of the mysteries is why that feeling

2174
01:44:40,011 --> 01:44:41,230
exists,
you know,

2175
01:44:41,260 --> 01:44:46,260
it's a genuine.
It's not a trivial thing that it's to 

2176
01:44:46,260 --> 01:44:47,540
say I did something difficult and that 
was worthwhile.

2177
01:44:47,720 --> 01:44:49,580
Basically what you're saying to yourself
as well,

2178
01:44:49,581 --> 01:44:54,581
there was a lot of suffering attendant 
on that along with the just general 

2179
01:44:54,581 --> 01:44:55,190
suffering of life,
but it turned out that was worth it.

2180
01:44:55,580 --> 01:45:00,580
That's what you want is like you want 
that sense that you're engaged in 

2181
01:45:00,580 --> 01:45:01,700
something that's worth it.
And I say,

2182
01:45:01,701 --> 01:45:02,350
well,
like I,

2183
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:07,920
I try to.
I'm not a like a casual optimist about 

2184
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:08,690
these sorts of things.
I mean,

2185
01:45:08,780 --> 01:45:13,780
one of the things I do in 12 rules for 
life is lay out the rationale that 

2186
01:45:13,780 --> 01:45:14,870
drives people like to call them by in 
high school killers.

2187
01:45:15,050 --> 01:45:18,140
Because I understand that rationale.
I've studied it for a long time.

2188
01:45:18,141 --> 01:45:21,650
I know why they did what they did and 
they have a powerful argument,

2189
01:45:22,010 --> 01:45:23,810
but it's wrong,
but you don't.

2190
01:45:24,230 --> 01:45:29,230
There's no sense in showing how it's 
wrong before showing that it's a 

2191
01:45:29,230 --> 01:45:29,870
powerful argument like light life is 
suffering.

2192
01:45:29,870 --> 01:45:32,690
There is lots of malevolence.
It's no wonder that people want to bring

2193
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:35,750
being itself to a halt.
They want to take revenge on.

2194
01:45:35,751 --> 01:45:38,870
It's not surprising.
It's the wrong way of going about it.

2195
01:45:39,140 --> 01:45:44,140
The right way is it's akin to the sorts 
of things that you were just observing 

2196
01:45:44,140 --> 01:45:47,741
as you take on a difficult task that 
pushes you past where you are already 

2197
01:45:47,741 --> 01:45:49,460
and you,
you succeed in it and you get this sense

2198
01:45:49,461 --> 01:45:51,860
that yes,
that was worthwhile.

2199
01:45:51,910 --> 01:45:56,910
It's like that's what you want.
You want to live in that place where 

2200
01:45:56,910 --> 01:45:57,170
things are worthwhile.
That's paradise on earth.

2201
01:45:57,171 --> 01:46:02,171
That's what that is and it isn't some 
happy little place where you know 

2202
01:46:02,171 --> 01:46:02,510
someone's feeding,
you peeled grapes.

2203
01:46:02,900 --> 01:46:03,850
That isn't what it is.
It's.

2204
01:46:03,851 --> 01:46:08,851
It's more like.
It's more like victory on the honorable 

2205
01:46:08,851 --> 01:46:11,510
battlefield or something like that.
You have the perception that people have

2206
01:46:11,511 --> 01:46:14,430
of ultimate success and ultimate 
happiness is a.

2207
01:46:14,530 --> 01:46:19,530
It seems motivated by what they don't 
have rather than an understanding of 

2208
01:46:19,530 --> 01:46:24,251
what success and happiness really is.
Their their ideas at one day I'm going 

2209
01:46:24,251 --> 01:46:28,281
to go and I'm going to be in my golden 
years and I'm just going to be able to 

2210
01:46:28,281 --> 01:46:29,840
sit around and do nothing until 
everybody to fuck off.

2211
01:46:30,020 --> 01:46:35,020
You won't be happy.
I know I talked to two to one of the 

2212
01:46:35,020 --> 01:46:36,440
people that I was working with who had a
vision for retirement.

2213
01:46:36,441 --> 01:46:36,770
I said,
well,

2214
01:46:36,771 --> 01:46:38,360
what's your vision for retirement?
Well,

2215
01:46:38,361 --> 01:46:39,950
I see myself in a beach,
you know,

2216
01:46:39,951 --> 01:46:42,050
some tropical country drinking 
margaritas.

2217
01:46:42,051 --> 01:46:43,490
And I thought,
first,

2218
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:45,870
that's not a plan,
that's a travel posters.

2219
01:46:45,871 --> 01:46:46,340
It's like,
okay,

2220
01:46:46,341 --> 01:46:47,990
let's,
let's walk through this.

2221
01:46:47,991 --> 01:46:52,991
All right,
so you go down to this tropical country 

2222
01:46:52,991 --> 01:46:55,940
and he goes,
sit on the beach and you have a 

2223
01:46:55,940 --> 01:46:55,940
margarita.
It's like,

2224
01:46:55,940 --> 01:46:56,340
okay,
well how many margarita is like 10.

2225
01:46:56,870 --> 01:46:57,780
Okay,
so gonna do that.

2226
01:46:57,781 --> 01:46:59,910
We're going to do that for six months.
You'll be dead.

2227
01:46:59,940 --> 01:47:01,590
Yeah.
Well you'll be this like pathetic,

2228
01:47:01,591 --> 01:47:04,800
sunburned,
like fat unhappy.

2229
01:47:04,801 --> 01:47:07,050
Hung over surrounding.
Yeah.

2230
01:47:07,051 --> 01:47:07,500
Yeah.
It's like,

2231
01:47:07,501 --> 01:47:12,501
that's your vision.
So how long can you have a margarita on 

2232
01:47:12,501 --> 01:47:15,681
the beach?
Like maybe you can do that once every 

2233
01:47:15,681 --> 01:47:15,681
six months for like 10 minutes,
something like that.

2234
01:47:15,681 --> 01:47:18,600
It's not a vision,
it's true.

2235
01:47:18,601 --> 01:47:21,270
But when you are working and slaving 
away,

2236
01:47:21,271 --> 01:47:24,960
you think about that beach with your 
feet up and the waiter comes over.

2237
01:47:24,961 --> 01:47:26,670
Would you like another margarita Mr.
Peterson?

2238
01:47:26,990 --> 01:47:30,690
Yes,
I would absolutely ready.

2239
01:47:30,840 --> 01:47:35,840
Exactly.
But it's like this 16 year old fantasy 

2240
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:35,840
of paradise.
It's like,

2241
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:36,870
well,
and it just doesn't work out.

2242
01:47:36,990 --> 01:47:41,990
So the thing that,
the thing is is that the thing that 

2243
01:47:41,990 --> 01:47:46,470
sustains people through life really is 
the lifting of a worthwhile burden.

2244
01:47:46,530 --> 01:47:49,470
It's something like that and it's partly
because we're social animals,

2245
01:47:49,471 --> 01:47:49,710
right?

2246
01:47:49,740 --> 01:47:54,740
It's like we're evolved to be useful to 
the people around us because they're 

2247
01:47:54,740 --> 01:47:56,910
much more likely to let us live if we're
like that.

2248
01:47:57,350 --> 01:48:02,350
So and,
and it's been very fun talking to 

2249
01:48:02,350 --> 01:48:02,520
especially talking to young men about 
this.

2250
01:48:02,521 --> 01:48:04,170
It's like,
well now it's.

2251
01:48:04,171 --> 01:48:06,030
The other thing too is I think the 
world,

2252
01:48:06,240 --> 01:48:08,310
the world is full of darkness,
let's say.

2253
01:48:08,820 --> 01:48:11,850
And we could say each of us have a 
little bit of light,

2254
01:48:11,910 --> 01:48:15,750
and if we released that light,
if we let it shine properly,

2255
01:48:15,990 --> 01:48:20,990
christ,
it's too cliched to go on with in some 

2256
01:48:20,990 --> 01:48:23,091
sense,
but the world is a lesser place if you 

2257
01:48:23,091 --> 01:48:26,700
do not reveal from within yourself what 
you have to reveal.

2258
01:48:26,970 --> 01:48:31,970
And the fact that the world is a lesser 
place actually turns out not to be 

2259
01:48:31,970 --> 01:48:31,970
trivial.
Like if you aren't everything,

2260
01:48:31,970 --> 01:48:34,080
you could be more.
People will die,

2261
01:48:34,410 --> 01:48:37,680
more people will suffer,
more evil will be unconstrained,

2262
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:42,800
more tyranny will reign,
more chaos will remain chaotic and 

2263
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:42,800
dangerous.

2264
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:44,010
All of that.
Do you mean this by this?

2265
01:48:44,011 --> 01:48:49,011
In the sense of like the old proverb of 
the wings of a butterfly fluttering 

2266
01:48:49,011 --> 01:48:49,300
become a hurricane.
It's,

2267
01:48:49,310 --> 01:48:52,200
it's something similar to that,
but it can even be more local.

2268
01:48:52,201 --> 01:48:57,060
It's like your family is more messed up 
than it could be if you were less messed

2269
01:48:57,061 --> 01:48:58,130
up than you are.
Right?

2270
01:48:58,470 --> 01:49:01,350
So if you just got your act together 
like 10 percent more,

2271
01:49:01,470 --> 01:49:04,140
your family would be one percent better.
So like,

2272
01:49:04,141 --> 01:49:09,141
well do it and that would ripple off.
And people that they interact and it 

2273
01:49:10,411 --> 01:49:13,050
ripples fast.
That's the other thing that's so cool is

2274
01:49:13,051 --> 01:49:17,310
that like people think,
well there's 7 billion of us and each of

2275
01:49:17,311 --> 01:49:21,240
us is just this separate dust mote like 
floating in the cosmos and what the hell

2276
01:49:21,241 --> 01:49:22,950
difference does it make what you do 
anyways?

2277
01:49:23,220 --> 01:49:24,870
It's like,
that is not how we're connected.

2278
01:49:25,380 --> 01:49:29,340
It's like you're the center of a network
and you know,

2279
01:49:29,460 --> 01:49:31,110
well you know,
way more people than this,

2280
01:49:31,111 --> 01:49:33,400
but let's say typically you know,
a thought,

2281
01:49:33,410 --> 01:49:38,410
you're going to know a thousand people 
in your life well enough to have an 

2282
01:49:38,410 --> 01:49:38,410
impact on them.
Okay?

2283
01:49:38,410 --> 01:49:40,200
And each of those thousand people is 
going to know a thousand people.

2284
01:49:40,201 --> 01:49:43,530
So you're one step from a million and 
two steps from a billion.

2285
01:49:44,130 --> 01:49:47,740
And we are network technically that 
that's how human work.

2286
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:50,650
And so when you do something that you 
shouldn't do,

2287
01:49:50,860 --> 01:49:55,860
it's worse than you think.
And when you do something that you 

2288
01:49:55,860 --> 01:49:55,860
should do,
it's better than you think.

2289
01:49:56,530 --> 01:50:01,530
And so you think,
well this is why I've been telling 

2290
01:50:01,530 --> 01:50:01,530
people will clean up your room.
It's like,

2291
01:50:01,530 --> 01:50:01,900
well,
your room is actually network to.

2292
01:50:02,080 --> 01:50:04,390
It's not that easy to clean up your room
to set it,

2293
01:50:04,810 --> 01:50:07,990
so you want your room to be set up so 
that when you walk in there,

2294
01:50:08,260 --> 01:50:10,960
it tells you to be better than you 
generally are.

2295
01:50:11,500 --> 01:50:14,020
It's organized,
it's got direction,

2296
01:50:14,110 --> 01:50:19,110
everything's in its place.
He tried to do that in a chaotic 

2297
01:50:19,110 --> 01:50:19,110
household.
You know,

2298
01:50:19,110 --> 01:50:21,400
I've watched people do this because I 
had students do these sorts of things as

2299
01:50:21,401 --> 01:50:22,210
assignments.
I'd say,

2300
01:50:22,211 --> 01:50:24,970
look,
pick us small moral goal,

2301
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:29,080
clean up your room and just write down 
what happens as a consequence.

2302
01:50:29,290 --> 01:50:31,930
So maybe these are students in a chaotic
household.

2303
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:36,960
the whole place is a bloody mess.
No one's taking any responsibility for 

2304
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:39,721
anything,
and so they decided they're going to 

2305
01:50:39,721 --> 01:50:39,820
start to clean up their room and then 
the people in the household notice,

2306
01:50:40,150 --> 01:50:45,150
well,
the first thing they do is get pissed 

2307
01:50:45,150 --> 01:50:45,150
off.
IT's like,

2308
01:50:45,150 --> 01:50:45,150
who do you think you are like,
you think you're better than us.

2309
01:50:45,420 --> 01:50:47,800
It's like,
why do you think this is worthwhile?

2310
01:50:48,040 --> 01:50:50,260
Who made,
who died and made you god?

2311
01:50:50,350 --> 01:50:55,350
All of that.
So just by trying to organize this 

2312
01:50:55,350 --> 01:50:58,291
little part of their life,
they immediately run into the people 

2313
01:50:58,291 --> 01:51:01,240
whose actions they're casting in a dim 
light by trying to improve themselves to

2314
01:51:01,241 --> 01:51:01,720
some degree.

2315
01:51:01,810 --> 01:51:06,810
They might have to have like a thorough 
war in their household to be allowed to 

2316
01:51:06,810 --> 01:51:08,620
do something as simple as keeping the 
room orderly.

2317
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:12,430
They find out very rapidly that a,
that's way more difficult than it sounds

2318
01:51:12,431 --> 01:51:16,270
and be that the consequences of it are 
far more far reaching than people think.

2319
01:51:16,720 --> 01:51:18,510
So that's quite fun,
you know,

2320
01:51:18,520 --> 01:51:23,520
because maybe part of it is,
is that like everything around you is 

2321
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:26,020
full of potential.
Everything maybe more potential than you

2322
01:51:26,021 --> 01:51:29,320
could ever possibly utilize.
And so maybe all you have is this little

2323
01:51:29,321 --> 01:51:31,870
rat hole of a room and some rundown 
place in the world.

2324
01:51:31,871 --> 01:51:35,740
It's like fix it up.
There's more there than you think.

2325
01:51:35,770 --> 01:51:38,890
See what happens if you fix it up and 
you'll fix yourself up.

2326
01:51:38,891 --> 01:51:43,891
Cymbalta obviously because you have to 
get disciplined in order to fix up the 

2327
01:51:43,891 --> 01:51:45,910
room and then you have a fixed up room 
and you'll be a more fixed up person.

2328
01:51:45,910 --> 01:51:48,790
IT's like you think that nothing will 
happen as a consequence of that.

2329
01:51:49,210 --> 01:51:51,460
It's like all hell will break loose as a
consequence of that.

2330
01:51:52,090 --> 01:51:57,090
That's really worth trying.
It is worth trying and it's a concept 

2331
01:51:57,090 --> 01:51:58,600
that seems alien to people,
but if you think about it,

2332
01:51:58,601 --> 01:51:59,920
it makes sense.
Well,

2333
01:51:59,921 --> 01:52:01,990
people don't take what they have right 
in front of them,

2334
01:52:01,991 --> 01:52:04,360
seriously enough.
It's like the wasting time thing.

2335
01:52:04,361 --> 01:52:06,230
They don't do the arithmetic,
you know,

2336
01:52:06,250 --> 01:52:11,250
and they also don't understand.
They devalue what they have right in 

2337
01:52:11,250 --> 01:52:11,250
front of them.
Like another,

2338
01:52:11,680 --> 01:52:16,680
another client I worked with was having 
a hard time putting his kid to bed at 

2339
01:52:16,680 --> 01:52:17,530
night and so we did the arithmetic.
It's like,

2340
01:52:17,531 --> 01:52:22,531
well I'm fighting with my kid for 45 
minutes a night trying to get him to go 

2341
01:52:22,531 --> 01:52:22,531
to bed.
Okay,

2342
01:52:22,531 --> 01:52:23,740
so let,
let's analyze that.

2343
01:52:23,770 --> 01:52:24,730
Alright,
so what does that mean?

2344
01:52:25,390 --> 01:52:30,390
Well,
it means that both of you end the day 

2345
01:52:30,390 --> 01:52:30,430
upset.
That's not so good because why would you

2346
01:52:30,431 --> 01:52:32,950
want that?
It means that you're spending 45 minutes

2347
01:52:32,951 --> 01:52:36,040
fighting when you could spend 20 minutes
doing something positive.

2348
01:52:36,041 --> 01:52:41,041
Like reading to him say means that you 
don't get to spend that time with your 

2349
01:52:41,041 --> 01:52:45,181
wife so she's not very happy with you.
Plus you're annoyed because you don't 

2350
01:52:45,181 --> 01:52:45,410
see here.
Plus you blame it on the kid because the

2351
01:52:45,411 --> 01:52:48,750
proximal cause it's like that's pretty 
damn ugly and then,

2352
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:52,070
and then let's do the arithmetic.
It's like seven days a week,

2353
01:52:52,071 --> 01:52:54,530
45 minUtes a day.
Let's call that five hours.

2354
01:52:54,980 --> 01:52:58,880
Twenty hours a week,
240 hours in a year six,

2355
01:52:58,940 --> 01:53:03,940
you're spending a month and a half of 
work weeks fighting with your four year 

2356
01:53:03,940 --> 01:53:03,940
old son.
You think you're going to like them.

2357
01:53:04,670 --> 01:53:09,670
You don't like anyone.
You spend a month and a half a year 

2358
01:53:09,670 --> 01:53:09,670
fighting with.

2359
01:53:09,670 --> 01:53:10,130
It's a bad idea.
Fix it.

2360
01:53:10,910 --> 01:53:13,130
It's important.
Get them to bed,

2361
01:53:13,190 --> 01:53:18,190
make it peaceful.
you do it like these things that repeat 

2362
01:53:18,190 --> 01:53:21,191
every single day.
That's a motif in this Book to your 

2363
01:53:21,191 --> 01:53:22,160
life.
Isn't margarita is on a beach in Jamaica

2364
01:53:22,940 --> 01:53:27,940
that happens now in that those are 
exceptions you're life is how your wife 

2365
01:53:27,940 --> 01:53:32,561
greets you at the door when you come 
home every day because that's like 10 

2366
01:53:32,691 --> 01:53:37,691
minutes a day.
Your life is how you treat each other 

2367
01:53:37,691 --> 01:53:40,451
over the breakfast table because that's 
an hour and a half or an hour every 

2368
01:53:40,451 --> 01:53:42,500
single day.
You get those mundane things,

2369
01:53:42,501 --> 01:53:44,230
right?
Those things you do everyday,

2370
01:53:44,240 --> 01:53:46,550
you concentrated on them and you make 
them pristine.

2371
01:53:46,551 --> 01:53:49,250
It's like you got 80 percent of your 
life put together.

2372
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:51,860
These little things that are right in 
front of us.

2373
01:53:52,460 --> 01:53:53,870
They're not little.
That's the first thing.

2374
01:53:53,930 --> 01:53:55,670
They are not little and they're hard to 
set.

2375
01:53:55,671 --> 01:53:56,690
Right,
and if you set them right,

2376
01:53:56,691 --> 01:54:00,590
it has a rippling effect and fast to way
faster than people think.

2377
01:54:01,140 --> 01:54:06,140
I want to talk about the rippling effect
because I know you've got to get out of 

2378
01:54:06,140 --> 01:54:09,261
here at one,
but I want to talk about the rippling 

2379
01:54:09,261 --> 01:54:11,301
effect that you have had on people and 
how how that makes you feel.

2380
01:54:12,301 --> 01:54:17,301
I mean,
you were relatively unknown just a year 

2381
01:54:17,301 --> 01:54:19,140
and a half,
two years ago and now you have become,

2382
01:54:20,430 --> 01:54:25,140
I mean for lack of a better term,
you're an online celebrity and your,

2383
01:54:25,770 --> 01:54:27,420
your reaches.
Fantastic.

2384
01:54:27,421 --> 01:54:32,421
Now this thing that you were talking 
about about how your impact can affect 

2385
01:54:32,421 --> 01:54:36,030
the people around you in a not very,
a not insignificant way,

2386
01:54:36,031 --> 01:54:38,790
a very significant way.
What has that been like for you?

2387
01:54:38,810 --> 01:54:40,550
I mean,
what does that adjustment than like just

2388
01:54:40,590 --> 01:54:43,560
I haven't adjusted to it.
How old are you?

2389
01:54:43,710 --> 01:54:47,280
Fifty five.
So for 53 years.

2390
01:54:47,580 --> 01:54:49,900
You're relatively anonymous.
Other outside of uni

2391
01:54:49,970 --> 01:54:50,630
versus.
Yeah.

2392
01:54:50,720 --> 01:54:51,800
Yeah.
I had a little bit of,

2393
01:54:52,200 --> 01:54:55,340
a little bit of exposure.
I did some work with a public television

2394
01:54:55,341 --> 01:55:00,341
station in Canada and I had my little 
flashes of public appearances that sort 

2395
01:55:01,011 --> 01:55:02,960
of crazy.

2396
01:55:03,180 --> 01:55:07,860
What you've done on thIs show mean 
millions,

2397
01:55:07,860 --> 01:55:09,940
millions.
People have listened and watched each,

2398
01:55:09,980 --> 01:55:11,910
each,
each individual episode.

2399
01:55:12,460 --> 01:55:14,740
Yeah.
There are about 2 million views each and

2400
01:55:14,750 --> 01:55:19,750
then that's nothing compared to youtube 
and youtube is nothing compared to the 

2401
01:55:19,750 --> 01:55:23,551
audio.
So the audio is like five times that or 

2402
01:55:23,551 --> 01:55:23,551
something.
Yeah.

2403
01:55:23,551 --> 01:55:23,551
So,
so that's,

2404
01:55:23,551 --> 01:55:24,430
yeah,
it's completely crazy.

2405
01:55:24,490 --> 01:55:25,780
No,
I haven't adjusted to it.

2406
01:55:26,170 --> 01:55:27,240
So I don't know.
I mean,

2407
01:55:27,250 --> 01:55:30,040
have You adjusted to your status?
I'm numb.

2408
01:55:31,030 --> 01:55:36,030
Yeah.
So what's it like when you think about 

2409
01:55:36,030 --> 01:55:38,641
it?
You wake up in the morning and you 

2410
01:55:38,641 --> 01:55:38,641
think,
okay,

2411
01:55:38,641 --> 01:55:38,641
I'm going to get a billion downloads 
this year.

2412
01:55:38,641 --> 01:55:42,440
I don't think that.
I think I'm going to talk to Jordan 

2413
01:55:42,440 --> 01:55:42,440
Peterson.
What do I want to talk about?

2414
01:55:42,440 --> 01:55:45,300
That's how I handle it.
It's exactly the same thing for the last

2415
01:55:45,301 --> 01:55:46,740
15 months.
This is what I've done.

2416
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:51,920
Got up in the morning.
I've looked at like 25 things I have to 

2417
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:54,420
do in a mad rush before 7:00
at night.

2418
01:55:54,750 --> 01:55:57,630
I think I'm going to go through them and
I'm gonna concentrate on them,

2419
01:55:57,870 --> 01:56:00,180
do the best job I can.
then at 7:00

2420
01:56:00,181 --> 01:56:05,181
tonight I'm going to have a rest.
I'm going to take a look at what I have 

2421
01:56:05,181 --> 01:56:05,181
to do tomorrow and I'm going to do the 
same thing.

2422
01:56:05,181 --> 01:56:08,160
That's what I've been doing.
And then when I stand back a little bit,

2423
01:56:08,161 --> 01:56:10,770
like when it sort of dawns on me,
you know,

2424
01:56:11,190 --> 01:56:14,310
then it's disconcerting.
Like it's surreal.

2425
01:56:15,420 --> 01:56:17,610
I can'T figure it out.
I can't understand it.

2426
01:56:18,030 --> 01:56:23,030
But then I.
But there's no sense dwelling on that 

2427
01:56:23,030 --> 01:56:24,520
because first of all,
I don't know how to conceptualize it.

2428
01:56:24,521 --> 01:56:29,250
I don't know why it's happening exactly.
Like I think what's happened is that two

2429
01:56:29,251 --> 01:56:31,290
things,
one is that I said it,

2430
01:56:31,291 --> 01:56:36,291
there was something I wouldn't do with 
regards to this legislation and I meant 

2431
01:56:36,291 --> 01:56:37,470
it.
I actually meant it.

2432
01:56:37,800 --> 01:56:42,800
I wasn't going to use those words under 
legal compulsion period no matter what 

2433
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:43,920
it actually meant that.
So there was that.

2434
01:56:44,190 --> 01:56:49,190
But then I think the more relevant thing
is that I've been studying these old 

2435
01:56:49,801 --> 01:56:51,900
stories,
these archetypal stories for a very long

2436
01:56:51,901 --> 01:56:56,901
period of time and they have power,
they really have power and they manifest

2437
01:56:57,061 --> 01:57:02,061
themselves everywhere.
They manifest themselves in movies and 

2438
01:57:02,061 --> 01:57:04,491
in books.
I mean harry potter's a mythological 

2439
01:57:04,491 --> 01:57:05,550
story and it made roland richer than the
queen of england.

2440
01:57:05,580 --> 01:57:07,410
You know,
these stories have power.

2441
01:57:07,830 --> 01:57:11,490
And I Was fortunate enough to study of 
large number of people,

2442
01:57:11,491 --> 01:57:14,190
large number of scholars who knew what 
that power was,

2443
01:57:14,191 --> 01:57:19,191
carl jung in particular,
and I could make it more accessible to 

2444
01:57:19,191 --> 01:57:20,460
people.
And so that's a big part of it.

2445
01:57:20,820 --> 01:57:23,640
But what the overall significance of 
that is?

2446
01:57:24,720 --> 01:57:25,320
Well,
I just,

2447
01:57:26,710 --> 01:57:30,150
it just leaves me speechless.

2448
01:57:30,270 --> 01:57:32,280
I mean this kathy newman things,
a good example.

2449
01:57:32,760 --> 01:57:34,350
And I mean,
so many things have happened.

2450
01:57:34,351 --> 01:57:35,280
I've,
I've got involved,

2451
01:57:35,281 --> 01:57:40,281
I've been in this scandal of some sort,
a serious scandal of some sort probably 

2452
01:57:40,831 --> 01:57:45,660
every three weeks for a year and a half.
And they're things that are just.

2453
01:57:46,050 --> 01:57:48,150
Well,
the james damore thing is a good example

2454
01:57:48,151 --> 01:57:49,500
of that.
Like that's a big deal.

2455
01:57:49,680 --> 01:57:51,960
You know,
that that explosion that,

2456
01:57:52,040 --> 01:57:57,040
that,
that emerged around him and the court 

2457
01:57:57,040 --> 01:57:57,040
case that's coming out of it,
it's a big deal.

2458
01:57:57,040 --> 01:57:59,370
And this thing with lindsay shepherd,
that was the worst scandal it ever hit a

2459
01:57:59,371 --> 01:58:04,371
canadian university.
And then there was all the protests and 

2460
01:58:04,371 --> 01:58:06,060
then there was what happened with 
channel four in the uk.

2461
01:58:06,061 --> 01:58:08,040
And it's like,
I don't know what to make of it.

2462
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:13,400
I don't what what I'm trying to do is 
have a good conversation when I come and

2463
01:58:15,211 --> 01:58:17,910
talk to somebody like you where we can 
have a good conversation.

2464
01:58:18,270 --> 01:58:23,270
Try not to say anything stupid.
That's really what I'm trying to do is 

2465
01:58:23,270 --> 01:58:26,631
to not say anything stupid or too 
stupid.

2466
01:58:27,250 --> 01:58:29,550
Yeah,
well indeed it's been high stakes poker,

2467
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:30,510
you know,
for.

2468
01:58:30,511 --> 01:58:35,511
It's not quite so bad now because 
especially after what happened with 

2469
01:58:35,511 --> 01:58:40,491
channel four and some journalists like 
people have been trying to take me out 

2470
01:58:40,491 --> 01:58:43,611
for quite a long time and it's not.
It isn't working so far actually.

2471
01:58:44,560 --> 01:58:47,110
You actually believe what you're saying 
and it actually makes sense.

2472
01:58:47,560 --> 01:58:48,370
We're all,
you know,

2473
01:58:48,470 --> 01:58:50,800
that's a start.
It's not a bad start,

2474
01:58:50,801 --> 01:58:55,801
but it's rare in this world.
This is especially in these 

2475
01:58:55,801 --> 01:58:58,651
ideologically charged times,
this toxic tribalism that we keep 

2476
01:58:58,651 --> 01:59:01,150
bringing up.
It's well and I also decided like a long

2477
01:59:01,151 --> 01:59:02,090
time ago,
and I,

2478
01:59:02,520 --> 01:59:05,920
I think this runs through 12 rules for 
life is well,

2479
01:59:05,921 --> 01:59:09,220
I believe that people's decisions tilt 
the world towards heaven or hell.

2480
01:59:09,430 --> 01:59:14,430
I think there's no more accurate way of 
describing the consequences of each of 

2481
01:59:14,651 --> 01:59:17,080
your decisions.
Then that you face potential,

2482
01:59:17,770 --> 01:59:20,320
that's what you face.
The that's what you face in the world is

2483
01:59:20,321 --> 01:59:22,720
potential.
It's not material reality,

2484
01:59:22,870 --> 01:59:27,870
its potential,
and every decision you make you're 

2485
01:59:27,870 --> 01:59:28,960
deciding whether you want to make the 
world better or worse,

2486
01:59:29,380 --> 01:59:34,380
and if you like,
the ultimate better is heaven and the 

2487
01:59:34,380 --> 01:59:34,960
ultimate worst is hell.
We know how to make the world into hail.

2488
01:59:35,460 --> 01:59:39,370
We we've done that multiple times.
Much of the 20th century was that.

2489
01:59:39,800 --> 01:59:41,170
It's like I looked at all that and I 
thought,

2490
01:59:41,171 --> 01:59:46,171
okay,
I would rather that the world didn't 

2491
01:59:46,171 --> 01:59:48,271
degenerate into hell and I understand 
why people wanted to degenerate into 

2492
01:59:48,271 --> 01:59:48,460
hell.
They're angry.

2493
01:59:48,940 --> 01:59:52,720
They're angry because they suffer,
they suffer unfairly,

2494
01:59:53,080 --> 01:59:54,790
and they suffer because people hurt 
them,

2495
01:59:55,420 --> 01:59:57,190
and so they think this is a bad game.

2496
01:59:57,250 --> 02:00:00,310
I'm not going to help make it better.
I'm angry.

2497
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:05,400
I'm going to make it worse.
Even that's what the columbine kids 

2498
02:00:05,400 --> 02:00:05,920
didn't know.
That's what all the mass shooters do.

2499
02:00:05,921 --> 02:00:07,990
They say to hell with this.
I hate it.

2500
02:00:08,200 --> 02:00:09,670
They're going to make it more behind the
game.

2501
02:00:09,671 --> 02:00:12,070
They just want to flip the table over.
At worse than that,

2502
02:00:12,071 --> 02:00:14,530
they want to obliterate the game.
Yes,

2503
02:00:14,670 --> 02:00:19,670
and and they want to do it with as much 
melyssa's possible just to obtain 

2504
02:00:19,670 --> 02:00:23,371
revenge and I understand that,
but I decided a long time ago that I 

2505
02:00:23,371 --> 02:00:24,400
would rather not play that game.
I think it.

2506
02:00:24,490 --> 02:00:27,670
I think that it's possible that we could
make the world better.

2507
02:00:27,940 --> 02:00:29,320
I really believe that.
Believe that too.

2508
02:00:29,410 --> 02:00:32,380
So I think while I'm trying to tell 
people,

2509
02:00:32,381 --> 02:00:35,200
look,
there's more to you than you think.

2510
02:00:35,590 --> 02:00:38,050
There's more potential.
There's more than enough potential to go

2511
02:00:38,051 --> 02:00:38,410
around.

2512
02:00:38,860 --> 02:00:41,020
There's definite suffering and 
malevolence in the world.

2513
02:00:41,140 --> 02:00:43,390
We could fix it.
You haven't got anything better to do.

2514
02:00:43,480 --> 02:00:45,940
That's a very big point,
that there's more potential to go around

2515
02:00:46,090 --> 02:00:51,090
more than enough.
More than people understand that we're 

2516
02:00:51,090 --> 02:00:51,090
not going to run out of potential.
We're not.

2517
02:00:51,090 --> 02:00:54,690
And this idea of the famine thinking is 
one of the reasons why people get upset 

2518
02:00:54,851 --> 02:00:59,851
at other people's success.
They stink somehow under the this other 

2519
02:00:59,851 --> 02:01:00,160
person's success.
Take something away from them.

2520
02:01:00,190 --> 02:01:01,240
Yup.
Yeah.

2521
02:01:01,241 --> 02:01:03,460
Well,
there's the other thing too,

2522
02:01:03,461 --> 02:01:08,461
is that I've realized that people 
actually act like what they confronted 

2523
02:01:08,461 --> 02:01:10,390
in the world is potential.
It's so funny because whatever potential

2524
02:01:10,391 --> 02:01:12,790
is.
It's not materially measurable,

2525
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,640
but if you tell someone you're not 
living up to your potential,

2526
02:01:15,641 --> 02:01:16,450
they go home.
Yeah.

2527
02:01:16,451 --> 02:01:17,290
Well,
I know that.

2528
02:01:17,320 --> 02:01:17,950
It's like,
well,

2529
02:01:17,951 --> 02:01:20,290
what is that potential that you're not 
living up to?

2530
02:01:20,860 --> 02:01:21,730
And then When you say,
well,

2531
02:01:21,731 --> 02:01:26,731
there's potential in front of you,
you know that you can walk out on the 

2532
02:01:26,731 --> 02:01:27,940
street and you go right or left or 
straight ahead like that.

2533
02:01:28,170 --> 02:01:33,170
You're facing this thing that isn't 
fully formed and you get to decide how 

2534
02:01:33,170 --> 02:01:37,030
it's going to form and you can make it 
better.

2535
02:01:37,150 --> 02:01:39,530
And so my question is like,
the world's a rough place.

2536
02:01:39,531 --> 02:01:41,840
There's no doubt about it.
It's a harsh place,

2537
02:01:42,500 --> 02:01:46,010
but my question is what would happen if 
we start making it worse?

2538
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:51,400
How good could it be if we stop making 
it worse and I don't know if there's an 

2539
02:01:51,400 --> 02:01:53,660
upper limit to that.
I get might be,

2540
02:01:53,780 --> 02:01:55,820
maybe we could make it really,
really,

2541
02:01:55,821 --> 02:01:57,920
really good.
Why not?

2542
02:01:58,160 --> 02:01:59,680
And we don't have anything better to do 
than that.

2543
02:02:00,260 --> 02:02:03,190
It's like aim at heaven.
Start at home.

2544
02:02:03,910 --> 02:02:06,220
Amen.
Heaven tell the truth.

2545
02:02:06,430 --> 02:02:08,650
Let's see what the hell happens.
You know,

2546
02:02:08,680 --> 02:02:09,350
like it's,
it's,

2547
02:02:09,370 --> 02:02:12,220
it is the case clearly on the facts of 
the matter.

2548
02:02:13,090 --> 02:02:18,090
In 20 years they wouldn't have to be a 
single person in the world that was 

2549
02:02:18,090 --> 02:02:20,401
hungry in 20 years.
We could get rid of the five biggest 

2550
02:02:20,401 --> 02:02:21,110
diseases that currently plague the 
planet.

2551
02:02:21,680 --> 02:02:26,680
We could straighten things up and god 
only knows what things could be like 

2552
02:02:26,680 --> 02:02:30,011
that.
Or we could let the whole thing 

2553
02:02:30,011 --> 02:02:30,011
degenerate into hell.

2554
02:02:30,011 --> 02:02:31,680
So in each of us is making that decision
with each decision.

2555
02:02:32,070 --> 02:02:33,570
That's the other thing that I've 
understood.

2556
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:39,130
So take your choice.
You want hell or you want to heaven

2557
02:02:40,970 --> 02:02:41,120
p,

2558
02:02:41,740 --> 02:02:46,740
if you pick hell,
just remember you knew what you were 

2559
02:02:46,740 --> 02:02:48,720
doing when you picked,
but nobody pixel.

2560
02:02:49,400 --> 02:02:51,150
Yeah.
To sort of let it slide.

2561
02:02:51,180 --> 02:02:56,180
The abbot,
they do it because they blind 

2562
02:02:56,180 --> 02:02:56,180
themselves.
You know,

2563
02:02:56,180 --> 02:02:56,850
you know when you do it you say,
ah,

2564
02:02:56,851 --> 02:02:59,090
well you know,
I let that slide and then you.

2565
02:02:59,100 --> 02:03:01,620
And then you don't think about it.
It's like you could think about it,

2566
02:03:02,010 --> 02:03:03,360
you could think about it,
you could know,

2567
02:03:04,350 --> 02:03:08,610
but you don't let yourself know.
Is any of this all,

2568
02:03:08,611 --> 02:03:11,250
all the pressure and the scandal every 
three weeks.

2569
02:03:11,670 --> 02:03:14,760
Is this a,
this is in weigh on you?

2570
02:03:14,820 --> 02:03:16,290
Is it,
is it difficult?

2571
02:03:16,640 --> 02:03:20,910
Uh,
how are you feeling like one new thing?

2572
02:03:21,150 --> 02:03:21,960
Stretch.
Yeah.

2573
02:03:21,961 --> 02:03:26,961
It's like,
it's like simultaneously the worst 

2574
02:03:26,961 --> 02:03:26,961
possible thing in the best possible 
thing that could happen.

2575
02:03:27,480 --> 02:03:30,090
Well,
financially it's been a boom,

2576
02:03:30,091 --> 02:03:30,930
right?
Yes.

2577
02:03:31,370 --> 02:03:33,360
It's.
Which says areas as an e.

2578
02:03:33,361 --> 02:03:34,150
Oh,
well I,

2579
02:03:34,650 --> 02:03:39,650
I mean the thing that I,
I shouldn't say this but I'm going to 

2580
02:03:39,650 --> 02:03:39,650
because it's just so god damn funny.
I can't help but say it.

2581
02:03:39,990 --> 02:03:42,510
I figured out how to monetize social 
justice warriors.

2582
02:03:44,640 --> 02:03:46,860
That is what it is.
I know.

2583
02:03:46,861 --> 02:03:49,470
It's so funny.
It just can't believe it either way.

2584
02:03:49,530 --> 02:03:51,000
It just,
every time.

2585
02:03:51,001 --> 02:03:56,001
I think that while it's just one of the 
surreal circumstances that characterize 

2586
02:03:56,001 --> 02:03:56,880
my life,
it's like I'm driving the social justice

2587
02:03:56,881 --> 02:04:01,881
activists in Canada mad because if they 
let me speak then I get to speak and 

2588
02:04:02,071 --> 02:04:04,200
then more people support me on patriot.
It's like,

2589
02:04:04,530 --> 02:04:06,450
that's annoying.
It's like god damn capitalists,

2590
02:04:06,451 --> 02:04:08,760
these make more money off this 
ideological warfare.

2591
02:04:08,761 --> 02:04:09,270
It's like,
okay,

2592
02:04:09,271 --> 02:04:10,740
fine,
let's go protest.

2593
02:04:11,020 --> 02:04:14,130
It's they go protest me,
then that goes up on youtube and then my

2594
02:04:14,131 --> 02:04:18,930
patron account goes way up.
So it's like they don't know what to do.

2595
02:04:18,931 --> 02:04:20,730
And so one of the things that keep,
yeah,

2596
02:04:21,540 --> 02:04:22,850
they keep accusing me of,
uh,

2597
02:04:23,240 --> 02:04:25,440
like hauling in the loot and I think,
well look,

2598
02:04:25,441 --> 02:04:30,441
here's the situation guys.
I give away everything I do online for 

2599
02:04:30,601 --> 02:04:31,200
free.

2600
02:04:31,980 --> 02:04:35,130
It's free and people are giving me 
money.

2601
02:04:35,131 --> 02:04:37,440
They're just sending it to me.
I'm not twisting arm,

2602
02:04:37,470 --> 02:04:39,150
not even asking them for it.
Well,

2603
02:04:39,330 --> 02:04:41,820
I guess that's not exactlY right because
I set up the patron account,

2604
02:04:41,821 --> 02:04:46,821
but that's more complicated than it 
looks that a lot of that was curiosity 

2605
02:04:46,821 --> 02:04:50,230
and I thought,
well I could increase the production 

2606
02:04:50,230 --> 02:04:52,941
quality of my online videos.
Well it was also the potential of you 

2607
02:04:52,941 --> 02:04:52,941
being removed from the university there.
Yes.

2608
02:04:52,941 --> 02:04:54,540
Well that.
And that was real life pension.

2609
02:04:54,600 --> 02:04:55,950
Oh yeah.
Oh and yeah,

2610
02:04:55,980 --> 02:04:58,440
people wanted that.
Yeah.

2611
02:04:58,441 --> 02:05:03,441
They haven't stopped wanting that in 
october when the lindsay shepherd 

2612
02:05:03,441 --> 02:05:06,390
scandal broke and it looked so bad for 
the left wing idiot logs,

2613
02:05:06,391 --> 02:05:11,391
like 200 university of toronto community
members signed a petition to get me 

2614
02:05:12,391 --> 02:05:17,391
fired again and I was kind of upset 
about that and this is what my life has 

2615
02:05:17,391 --> 02:05:17,391
been like.

2616
02:05:17,391 --> 02:05:19,800
It's so.
My son came over that day and I said,

2617
02:05:19,801 --> 02:05:20,850
jesus julian,
you know,

2618
02:05:20,900 --> 02:05:25,830
like 200 people at the faculty member at
the university of toronto petitioned the

2619
02:05:25,831 --> 02:05:30,831
faculty association and then they send 
in a petition to the administration to 

2620
02:05:30,831 --> 02:05:31,140
get me fired.
It was the faculty association.

2621
02:05:31,170 --> 02:05:36,170
That's my union.
They didn't even contact me and julian 

2622
02:05:36,170 --> 02:05:36,170
said,
don't worry about it data.

2623
02:05:36,170 --> 02:05:40,200
It was only 200 people and I thought 
that's where my life is like it's like a

2624
02:05:40,201 --> 02:05:44,940
day where 200 people signed a petition 
to get me fired as a professor.

2625
02:05:45,570 --> 02:05:46,800
My son can come in and say,
well,

2626
02:05:46,801 --> 02:05:48,910
that's not so bad.
It's like it's only 200 pets.

2627
02:05:50,220 --> 02:05:51,270
That's right.
It's so.

2628
02:05:51,570 --> 02:05:54,220
It's so surreal because you

2629
02:05:54,640 --> 02:05:59,640
say that online and look what's 
happening and then the support would be 

2630
02:05:59,640 --> 02:06:01,870
overwhelming.
It's a who knows how many people.

2631
02:06:02,210 --> 02:06:03,230
Well,
the administration.

2632
02:06:03,870 --> 02:06:04,620
Yeah,
absolutely.

2633
02:06:04,621 --> 02:06:09,621
Well,
in the administration at the university 

2634
02:06:09,621 --> 02:06:09,621
of toronto,
like they didn't take.

2635
02:06:09,621 --> 02:06:10,500
They didn't take it seriously at all 
called have me removed.

2636
02:06:10,530 --> 02:06:12,870
It didn't cause any.
Didn't even cause a ripple.

2637
02:06:13,080 --> 02:06:15,630
Now who were these 200 people and what 
was their motivation?

2638
02:06:16,110 --> 02:06:21,110
Oh,
well they're hard to say what their 

2639
02:06:21,110 --> 02:06:21,110
motivation was.
Not very happy about

2640
02:06:21,110 --> 02:06:22,730
see where they read the transcript or 
listen to those recordings.

2641
02:06:23,480 --> 02:06:28,010
How could they possibly be against you 
based on that?

2642
02:06:28,470 --> 02:06:33,470
Oh,
because they think that the people who 

2643
02:06:33,470 --> 02:06:33,470
who,
who conducted the inquisition were.

2644
02:06:33,470 --> 02:06:34,770
Right.
Well,

2645
02:06:34,790 --> 02:06:37,050
that's madness.
Oh yes.

2646
02:06:37,440 --> 02:06:38,330
But look,
look,

2647
02:06:38,331 --> 02:06:43,331
I mean,
I mean this formally like 20 members of 

2648
02:06:43,331 --> 02:06:43,590
pim,
lots and rambo count as faculty.

2649
02:06:43,740 --> 02:06:47,130
That was communications at wilfrid.
Laurier wrote a letter supporting them.

2650
02:06:48,840 --> 02:06:51,030
So that's why it's not an isolated 
incident.

2651
02:06:51,031 --> 02:06:51,510
It's like,
no,

2652
02:06:51,511 --> 02:06:56,511
no.
They thought that what they were doing 

2653
02:06:56,511 --> 02:06:56,511
was right.
It's massive stereo.

2654
02:06:56,511 --> 02:06:57,090
While there is an element of that,
that's for sure.

2655
02:06:57,230 --> 02:06:58,790
And there's certainly,
again,

2656
02:06:58,820 --> 02:07:01,700
I hate to bring this term up again,
but this toxic tribalism thing,

2657
02:07:01,710 --> 02:07:05,360
this like they are there supporting 
their own and they understand that their

2658
02:07:05,361 --> 02:07:10,361
own ideologies had been completely 
connected to the same type of group 

2659
02:07:10,361 --> 02:07:13,640
thing that's going against lindsay 
shepherd on that meeting when they tried

2660
02:07:13,641 --> 02:07:15,840
to paint her as a radical right winger 
and data,

2661
02:07:16,040 --> 02:07:17,810
which she certainly isn't.
Of course.

2662
02:07:17,820 --> 02:07:22,820
No,
neither of You mean the whole thing is 

2663
02:07:22,820 --> 02:07:22,850
ridiculous and you're not outright.
You're not a neo nazi,

2664
02:07:22,851 --> 02:07:23,240
you're not.
I've,

2665
02:07:23,241 --> 02:07:28,241
I've read a lot of crazy things about 
you and knowing you personally seeing 

2666
02:07:28,241 --> 02:07:28,580
this stuff.
I'm like,

2667
02:07:28,581 --> 02:07:31,150
this is,
this is A fascinating time to be live,

2668
02:07:31,190 --> 02:07:31,970
that's for sure.

2669
02:07:32,050 --> 02:07:32,830
That's for sure.
Yeah.

2670
02:07:32,831 --> 02:07:33,820
And it's been,
well,

2671
02:07:33,821 --> 02:07:36,690
it's been crazily.
Well I'm,

2672
02:07:37,030 --> 02:07:38,800
what would I say,
crazy stressful.

2673
02:07:39,220 --> 02:07:44,220
It's,
it's the best way to describe it is 

2674
02:07:44,220 --> 02:07:44,360
surreal.
Like I'm,

2675
02:07:44,420 --> 02:07:47,290
it's like I stepped outside myself.
I can't,

2676
02:07:48,580 --> 02:07:52,210
I can't put this in a box.
I don't knoW what to make of it.

2677
02:07:52,240 --> 02:07:54,490
I don't know what to make of the channel
for interview.

2678
02:07:55,200 --> 02:07:55,780
You know?
It's like,

2679
02:07:55,781 --> 02:07:57,690
what the hell really?
It's,

2680
02:07:57,691 --> 02:07:59,380
it's,
it's crazy,

2681
02:08:00,460 --> 02:08:02,060
it's,
it's this,

2682
02:08:02,061 --> 02:08:05,570
these conversations are so limited by 
what you were sayIng before that they're

2683
02:08:05,571 --> 02:08:10,571
trying to get this five minute soundbite
in and that's what television has 

2684
02:08:10,571 --> 02:08:11,000
become.
It's a dying medium.

2685
02:08:11,360 --> 02:08:16,360
It doesn't make any sense.
It doesn't make any sense to sandwich 

2686
02:08:16,360 --> 02:08:16,610
these commercials in every 15 minutes or
whatever they do.

2687
02:08:16,940 --> 02:08:21,940
None of it makes any sense.
It's an archaic way of communicating 

2688
02:08:21,940 --> 02:08:21,940
ideas as

2689
02:08:21,940 --> 02:08:23,370
well.
Then I think that is part of it too,

2690
02:08:23,371 --> 02:08:27,090
is that like I happened to catch a 
technological wave.

2691
02:08:27,091 --> 02:08:29,600
Well like you dId.
I mean their,

2692
02:08:29,700 --> 02:08:33,570
their television offers nothing over 
youtube.

2693
02:08:33,750 --> 02:08:37,740
Nothing.
You offers everything that tv.

2694
02:08:37,800 --> 02:08:38,680
Yeah.
Well exactly.

2695
02:08:38,740 --> 02:08:43,740
Yeah.
And then there's no space requirements 

2696
02:08:43,740 --> 02:08:46,641
on youtube so you don't have to do this,
twist the complex event into a short 

2697
02:08:47,161 --> 02:08:52,161
sound bite and entertain everyone.
And it turns out too that there's this 

2698
02:08:52,161 --> 02:08:55,671
huge audience online for actual content,
like just genuine conversation because 

2699
02:08:56,650 --> 02:08:58,920
like one of the things that's happened 
between you and I when,

2700
02:08:58,921 --> 02:09:01,530
when I've come down here is we've 
actually had a conversation,

2701
02:09:01,620 --> 02:09:03,270
right?
We're trying to figure things out.

2702
02:09:03,900 --> 02:09:05,490
You know,
we've got our viewpoints and everything,

2703
02:09:05,491 --> 02:09:10,491
but we're basically an outline this and 
there's a chapter in 12 rules for life 

2704
02:09:10,491 --> 02:09:15,141
called assume that the person you're 
talking to might know something you 

2705
02:09:15,141 --> 02:09:18,741
don't,
which is like the formula for a good 

2706
02:09:18,741 --> 02:09:18,741
conversation.

2707
02:09:18,741 --> 02:09:20,130
It's like there's a bunch of things I 
don't understand about the world.

2708
02:09:20,220 --> 02:09:21,540
I mean that.
That's a big book.

2709
02:09:21,541 --> 02:09:23,280
Things I don't understand about the 
world,

2710
02:09:23,281 --> 02:09:28,281
right?
That's a very thick book and I can come 

2711
02:09:28,281 --> 02:09:30,441
in here and talk to you about what's 
going on and hopefully we both emerged 

2712
02:09:30,441 --> 02:09:33,561
with better understanding.
We're not tHe same people that we were 

2713
02:09:33,561 --> 02:09:33,720
when we walked in and that's a good 
thing.

2714
02:09:33,721 --> 02:09:38,721
And then we have those conversations 
online and people can participate in 

2715
02:09:38,721 --> 02:09:40,210
that and I'm trying to do that in my 
lectures to like when I,

2716
02:09:40,270 --> 02:09:45,270
when I did this biblical series,
because that was another thing that was 

2717
02:09:45,270 --> 02:09:46,180
so strange,
chose like imagine I walked into a,

2718
02:09:46,640 --> 02:09:50,520
like a venture capitalist organization.
I said,

2719
02:09:50,521 --> 02:09:51,690
look,
I want you guys to bank.

2720
02:09:51,691 --> 02:09:56,691
Roll me.
I'm going to do 15 lectures on the old 

2721
02:09:56,691 --> 02:09:56,691
testament and I'm Going to try to 
attract young men.

2722
02:09:56,691 --> 02:09:59,310
I'm going to rent a theater.
like they just laughed me out of there.

2723
02:09:59,311 --> 02:10:02,610
So could you imagine anything less 
scalable than that?

2724
02:10:04,480 --> 02:10:06,930
So I did that.
I went ahead with it.

2725
02:10:06,931 --> 02:10:09,720
I rented the theater and then I walked 
through these stories and I was learning

2726
02:10:09,721 --> 02:10:13,800
a lot because like I knew this first 
stories in genesis up to the flood.

2727
02:10:13,801 --> 02:10:18,801
I knew them pretty well.
I knew kind of understood what they 

2728
02:10:18,801 --> 02:10:20,781
meant,
but then all the stories from abraham 

2729
02:10:20,781 --> 02:10:22,941
onward I had read them but I hadn't done
an detailed in depth analysis and so I 

2730
02:10:23,431 --> 02:10:28,431
was learning a tremendous amount of 
walking through those stories and they 

2731
02:10:28,431 --> 02:10:32,001
had a big.
They'd had a big impact man and So I'm 

2732
02:10:32,281 --> 02:10:34,820
going to do exodus soon because I want 
to do that,

2733
02:10:34,821 --> 02:10:38,600
but it's just another example of how 
surreal things have become,

2734
02:10:38,990 --> 02:10:41,480
but also the use the utility of a good 
conversation.

2735
02:10:41,481 --> 02:10:43,190
Because like when I'm up on on

2736
02:10:44,130 --> 02:10:45,600
on the podium,
say lecturing,

2737
02:10:45,930 --> 02:10:50,930
I'm not exactly lecturing.
I'm trying to figure something out and 

2738
02:10:50,930 --> 02:10:53,940
sharing that process with the audience,
which is so different than what is going

2739
02:10:53,941 --> 02:10:58,620
on in universities that is freaking 
everybody out and see what's going on.

2740
02:10:58,621 --> 02:11:01,500
Is this indoctrination into this group 
thing?

2741
02:11:01,540 --> 02:11:02,190
Yeah.
It's like,

2742
02:11:02,220 --> 02:11:04,590
here's what's right.
Memorize it.

2743
02:11:04,640 --> 02:11:06,780
Right.
It's like my lectures are more like,

2744
02:11:06,840 --> 02:11:07,920
well,
I don't know what's right.

2745
02:11:07,950 --> 02:11:10,680
Like here's some things I know and they 
seem to be working in.

2746
02:11:10,681 --> 02:11:14,460
Here's how I use those tools to dig it,
this story and here's what it might mean

2747
02:11:14,461 --> 02:11:19,461
and this is what I got from it and been 
here some universal truths about human 

2748
02:11:19,461 --> 02:11:20,950
beings that that seemed to be,
and then I've tried to explore that.

2749
02:11:20,951 --> 02:11:21,510
It's like,
well,

2750
02:11:21,511 --> 02:11:23,010
should we believe this?
Should we?

2751
02:11:23,300 --> 02:11:25,770
Like when abraham in the abrahamic 
story,

2752
02:11:25,771 --> 02:11:30,771
for example,
I mean abraham was an old guy and he's 

2753
02:11:30,771 --> 02:11:31,530
basically lived in his mom's basement.
That's really the beginning of the story

2754
02:11:31,670 --> 02:11:33,090
and he gets a call to adventure.
you know,

2755
02:11:33,091 --> 02:11:34,350
god says,
will get,

2756
02:11:34,470 --> 02:11:39,470
get,
get away from your family and your can 

2757
02:11:39,470 --> 02:11:39,470
get out there in the world.
It's the call to adventure.

2758
02:11:39,470 --> 02:11:39,470
thank.
Okay,

2759
02:11:39,470 --> 02:11:40,800
fine.
That's a heroic motif,

2760
02:11:40,950 --> 02:11:45,950
but then abraham goes out and the first 
thing he encounters is like tyranny and 

2761
02:11:45,950 --> 02:11:46,830
starvation and then a bunch of guys who 
want to steal his wife,

2762
02:11:47,760 --> 02:11:48,300
so it's,

2763
02:11:50,030 --> 02:11:55,030
it's been entertaining to take those 
stories apart and to see why they're 

2764
02:11:55,030 --> 02:11:57,770
foundational because they are 
foundational and they're not mirror

2765
02:11:59,620 --> 02:12:03,460
ignorance that what whatever they are.
Ignorance.

2766
02:12:03,461 --> 02:12:08,170
Superstition is not the right categorY.
How has this changed your classrooms?

2767
02:12:09,760 --> 02:12:14,760
Well,
I haven't gone back teaching since all 

2768
02:12:14,760 --> 02:12:14,830
of this hit because when diD you stop 
teaching?

2769
02:12:14,850 --> 02:12:15,580
Oh,
well.

2770
02:12:17,080 --> 02:12:18,220
Oh no,
I guess that's not true.

2771
02:12:18,250 --> 02:12:22,600
That's not true.
I taught from january to may of 2016.

2772
02:12:23,020 --> 02:12:24,320
Well,
first way it,

2773
02:12:24,460 --> 02:12:25,980
it changed.
It was that I was like so,

2774
02:12:26,280 --> 02:12:31,280
so shell shocked when I went to to teach
last january that and I was really sick.

2775
02:12:31,991 --> 02:12:35,950
Like I've been really sick this year.
I had like last january,

2776
02:12:35,980 --> 02:12:37,420
jesus.
It was just dismal.

2777
02:12:37,421 --> 02:12:39,670
I wouldn't have worst wish that on my 
worst enemy.

2778
02:12:39,671 --> 02:12:41,590
I had three weeks where I didn't sleep a
wink.

2779
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:47,000
He try that.
That's really entertaining for one long 

2780
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:47,050
day of misery.
that's three weeks long.

2781
02:12:47,051 --> 02:12:50,470
What kind of a an illness?
It looks like an auto immune disorder.

2782
02:12:50,500 --> 02:12:52,150
Do you think this is because of stress?
No,

2783
02:12:52,170 --> 02:12:53,710
I don't.
You don't think it's connected at all?

2784
02:12:54,550 --> 02:12:56,290
Yeah,
I think it probably made it worse,

2785
02:12:56,291 --> 02:12:58,420
but no.
It's something that I battled with for a

2786
02:12:58,421 --> 02:13:03,421
long time and it's something that really
both my wife and I have autoimmune 

2787
02:13:03,421 --> 02:13:06,850
illness and my daughter got what on?
I don't know exactly what it is.

2788
02:13:07,090 --> 02:13:09,570
I don't know what it is in my daughter.
Manifest.

2789
02:13:09,670 --> 02:13:11,670
Yes.
That's what's fixed.

2790
02:13:11,740 --> 02:13:14,350
What fixed it?
All I eat is meat and greens.

2791
02:13:15,270 --> 02:13:16,590
That's it.
No juice?

2792
02:13:16,591 --> 02:13:17,700
No.
No vegetables,

2793
02:13:17,760 --> 02:13:20,550
no carbohydrates.
Meet grades.

2794
02:13:20,880 --> 02:13:22,230
That's it.
And that fixed it.

2795
02:13:22,620 --> 02:13:25,500
That seems to have fixed.
It fixes so many people.

2796
02:13:26,100 --> 02:13:28,520
If you've listened to the podcast,
I've done that.

2797
02:13:28,530 --> 02:13:29,020
Yeah,
yeah,

2798
02:13:29,030 --> 02:13:29,520
yeah.
Well,

2799
02:13:29,521 --> 02:13:34,521
I've been following them because my 
daughter has blog to called don't eat 

2800
02:13:34,521 --> 02:13:35,790
that and my daughter had a terrible 
autoimmune disorder.

2801
02:13:35,850 --> 02:13:38,220
It was awful.
I detail that out in chapter 12.

2802
02:13:38,550 --> 02:13:42,600
She had 38 affected joints and she had 
her hip and her ankle replacement.

2803
02:13:42,601 --> 02:13:43,830
She was 16.
Jesus,

2804
02:13:43,910 --> 02:13:47,430
so she walked around on two broken legs 
for a year and unscrewed,

2805
02:13:47,470 --> 02:13:52,470
creating pain.
She goes on extremely high doses of 

2806
02:13:52,470 --> 02:13:52,680
opiates and so she was addicted to 
opiates,

2807
02:13:52,980 --> 02:13:55,100
which she like.
She just wants.

2808
02:13:55,140 --> 02:14:00,140
She had her surgery.
She just went off them cold Turkey and 

2809
02:14:00,140 --> 02:14:00,960
suffered through the withdrawal for two 
months and compared to what she had been

2810
02:14:00,961 --> 02:14:05,961
through,
that was nothing like what she went 

2811
02:14:05,961 --> 02:14:05,961
through.

2812
02:14:05,961 --> 02:14:06,630
Man knew it was dreadful and that was 
just the surface of it.

2813
02:14:06,631 --> 02:14:08,340
Like that was only the beginning of her 
illness.

2814
02:14:08,341 --> 02:14:13,341
She had all sorts of other things that 
were worse than that and so and we 

2815
02:14:13,341 --> 02:14:17,781
figured she was probably going to die by
the time she was 30 because my cousin's 

2816
02:14:17,781 --> 02:14:20,280
daughter had a similar autoimmune 
problem and she died when she was 30,

2817
02:14:20,460 --> 02:14:24,690
so it was bloody dreadful,
but she figured out at one point that it

2818
02:14:24,691 --> 02:14:29,040
was associated with diet and then she 
went on a radically restrictive diet and

2819
02:14:29,041 --> 02:14:32,370
she christ she,
she was on antidepressants.

2820
02:14:32,400 --> 02:14:34,710
She's not.
She had take ritalin to stay awake.

2821
02:14:34,740 --> 02:14:39,740
She can only stay awake about six hours 
a day and she had to take high doses of 

2822
02:14:39,740 --> 02:14:39,740
ritalin.
Distilling she,

2823
02:14:39,740 --> 02:14:41,970
what is this autoimmune disease.
While she had,

2824
02:14:42,570 --> 02:14:47,570
her diagnosis was rheumatoid arthritis,
but she didn't have the blood markers 

2825
02:14:47,570 --> 02:14:49,740
for it,
but she had all the other symptoms.

2826
02:14:50,160 --> 02:14:50,880
Anyway,
she,

2827
02:14:50,940 --> 02:14:55,940
she figured out this restrictive diet.
She only ate chicken and broccoli for 

2828
02:14:55,940 --> 02:14:59,001
about two months and almost all her 
symptoms went away and she's pretty much

2829
02:14:59,821 --> 02:15:01,380
symptom free now,
which is,

2830
02:15:01,740 --> 02:15:06,740
it's a complete miracle and she 
convinced me to try this diet about a 

2831
02:15:06,740 --> 02:15:11,720
year and a half ago,
and so I lost seven pounds a month for 

2832
02:15:11,720 --> 02:15:11,720
seven months.
That was the first thing,

2833
02:15:11,880 --> 02:15:13,530
which was just bloody amazing.
Yeah,

2834
02:15:13,531 --> 02:15:15,540
it was unbelievable.
It was unbelievable.

2835
02:15:15,541 --> 02:15:16,800
I couldn't believe it.
You know,

2836
02:15:16,810 --> 02:15:19,530
you was your diet rich and refined 
carbohydrates before that,

2837
02:15:19,700 --> 02:15:22,800
rich or not rich enough,
you know,

2838
02:15:23,310 --> 02:15:24,990
um,
pastas and bread,

2839
02:15:25,420 --> 02:15:26,370
bread,
bread,

2840
02:15:26,610 --> 02:15:28,230
bread in particular,
a lot of bread.

2841
02:15:29,460 --> 02:15:31,650
So the first thing that happened was a 
quit snoring.

2842
02:15:31,770 --> 02:15:33,390
That happened immediately.
Took,

2843
02:15:33,480 --> 02:15:35,400
took one week and I was snoring quite 
badly.

2844
02:15:35,540 --> 02:15:37,110
That.
So that disappeared in a week.

2845
02:15:37,620 --> 02:15:38,730
And that was amazing.
I thought,

2846
02:15:38,731 --> 02:15:39,630
oh,
that's interesting.

2847
02:15:39,631 --> 02:15:41,880
And then I had gastric reflux disorder 
that went away.

2848
02:15:42,600 --> 02:15:44,520
And then I lost seven pounds the first 
mOnth.

2849
02:15:44,521 --> 02:15:45,150
I thought,
whoa,

2850
02:15:45,360 --> 02:15:47,280
that's a lot.
Seven pounds.

2851
02:15:47,850 --> 02:15:50,880
I had psoriasis that went away.
I had floaters in my right eye,

2852
02:15:50,970 --> 02:15:53,580
which is also an autoimmune problem that
went away.

2853
02:15:54,840 --> 02:15:58,680
I have had gum disease for 30 years.
That went away.

2854
02:15:59,550 --> 02:16:00,870
That went away.
That's amazing.

2855
02:16:00,871 --> 02:16:02,790
I'm 55,
like my gum disease went away.

2856
02:16:03,840 --> 02:16:08,840
It's ridiculous.
So I figured all that out my life in the

2857
02:16:09,330 --> 02:16:09,720
last year.
It was so,

2858
02:16:09,800 --> 02:16:13,230
so strange because I'd get up in the 
morning and I'd think,

2859
02:16:14,850 --> 02:16:19,850
god,
all these bloody scandalous things are 

2860
02:16:19,850 --> 02:16:19,850
happening around me and I have to deal 
with that.

2861
02:16:19,850 --> 02:16:22,170
And then I think I need a break,
but I can't eat anything.

2862
02:16:23,320 --> 02:16:28,320
I can't eat anything because if I ate 
the wrong thing it would knock me out 

2863
02:16:28,320 --> 02:16:31,611
for a month.
So I was trying to figure out what the 

2864
02:16:31,611 --> 02:16:31,611
hell was wrong,
my diet.

2865
02:16:31,611 --> 02:16:31,870
And I was feeding wretched.
And so it was like,

2866
02:16:32,170 --> 02:16:35,680
if I was like wolves at the backdoor and
crocodiles at the front door,

2867
02:16:35,681 --> 02:16:37,390
something like that.
So,

2868
02:16:37,391 --> 02:16:40,390
but,
but whatever,

2869
02:16:40,720 --> 02:16:43,780
like I'm down to the same weight I was 
when I was 25.

2870
02:16:44,110 --> 02:16:45,100
Wow.
Yeah.

2871
02:16:45,130 --> 02:16:46,750
No kidding.
And I've got lots of energy.

2872
02:16:46,751 --> 02:16:51,751
I wake up in the morning and I wake up.
That's never happened to me in my whole 

2873
02:16:51,751 --> 02:16:51,751
life.
I've always had to have a shower,

2874
02:16:51,751 --> 02:16:53,440
like took me an hour to wake up my whole
life.

2875
02:16:53,560 --> 02:16:55,210
That's gone.
I'm not hungry.

2876
02:16:56,410 --> 02:16:59,440
I don't have hyperglycemia.
I've lots of energy.

2877
02:17:00,220 --> 02:17:02,410
Um,
I can't eat anything but.

2878
02:17:02,530 --> 02:17:05,350
So I can't go out for dinner and then 
you can't eat nonsense you can eat.

2879
02:17:05,351 --> 02:17:07,510
I mean I'm on the same diet,
eat meat and greens.

2880
02:17:08,020 --> 02:17:12,250
I don't have a disorder like you did in 
the same regard.

2881
02:17:12,251 --> 02:17:15,460
But I take a day where I have a cheat 
day.

2882
02:17:15,650 --> 02:17:17,590
No,
I don't even do it every week we'll have

2883
02:17:17,591 --> 02:17:18,930
a cheeseburger or something like that.
Yeah.

2884
02:17:19,300 --> 02:17:21,460
But for the most part,
that's the diet that I follow as well.

2885
02:17:21,730 --> 02:17:22,540
Yep.
Well,

2886
02:17:22,570 --> 02:17:24,760
for some people it seems like,
like,

2887
02:17:24,761 --> 02:17:27,080
uh,
well from massive amount of people,

2888
02:17:27,090 --> 02:17:29,230
well I think for far more people than we
knew.

2889
02:17:29,231 --> 02:17:31,840
I think people are carbohydrate 
poisoning themselves.

2890
02:17:31,841 --> 02:17:33,270
Like they can't believe.
Yes.

2891
02:17:33,320 --> 02:17:36,100
And along with all the other things that
go along with it,

2892
02:17:36,101 --> 02:17:41,101
insulin,
the blood sugar's not good cholesterol 

2893
02:17:41,101 --> 02:17:43,810
in this,
this idea that cholesterol and saturated

2894
02:17:43,811 --> 02:17:46,390
fat are the problems that people are 
experienCing.

2895
02:17:46,391 --> 02:17:47,210
It's not true.
Nope.

2896
02:17:47,320 --> 02:17:50,470
The real problem is sugar and 
cholesterol has been demonized.

2897
02:17:50,960 --> 02:17:55,960
I'm sure you read the article New York 
times or the sugar industry paid off 

2898
02:17:55,960 --> 02:17:56,900
scientists to lie about the results.
yep.

2899
02:17:57,180 --> 02:17:57,700
Yep.
Well,

2900
02:17:57,740 --> 02:18:01,660
I know too that to food scientists in 
the uk resigned about three years ago.

2901
02:18:01,870 --> 02:18:06,870
They were,
they were part and parcel of the 

2902
02:18:06,870 --> 02:18:06,870
organization that it pRoduced.
The food pyramid.

2903
02:18:06,870 --> 02:18:08,620
They said it was the worst public health
disaster the last 40 years.

2904
02:18:09,010 --> 02:18:11,500
It's pretty much got it backwards and 
you look around,

2905
02:18:11,501 --> 02:18:12,970
you know,
you drive through the u.

2906
02:18:12,970 --> 02:18:15,460
S it's really obvious in the us is 
people are overweight.

2907
02:18:15,461 --> 02:18:16,450
Like matt,
like,

2908
02:18:16,520 --> 02:18:17,860
oh yeah.
Like it's crazy.

2909
02:18:17,861 --> 02:18:20,020
It's crazy ridiculous.
go to disneyland.

2910
02:18:20,021 --> 02:18:20,580
Yeah,
exactly.

2911
02:18:20,581 --> 02:18:21,520
It's insane.
It is,

2912
02:18:21,521 --> 02:18:22,870
but you know,
and the reason is,

2913
02:18:22,930 --> 02:18:25,990
as far as I can tell,
the reason is is that they're,

2914
02:18:26,320 --> 02:18:28,270
they're poisoning themselves with 
carbohydrates.

2915
02:18:28,450 --> 02:18:31,420
That's what it looks like.
And the thought process is so out of,

2916
02:18:31,480 --> 02:18:36,480
out of whack.
I retweeted an article today from nina 

2917
02:18:36,480 --> 02:18:36,480
thai shorts.
She,

2918
02:18:36,480 --> 02:18:41,170
she tweeted it about this trend of 
eating only egg whites and how terrible 

2919
02:18:42,131 --> 02:18:42,730
it is for you.
It's a,

2920
02:18:42,760 --> 02:18:47,760
it's a health disaster and this idea 
that cholesterol from the egg yolk is 

2921
02:18:47,760 --> 02:18:47,760
bad for you.

2922
02:18:47,760 --> 02:18:50,220
it's one of the most important things 
you can eat is it's.

2923
02:18:50,230 --> 02:18:54,790
And then weightwatchers is adjusted.
See it goes weightwatchers died program.

2924
02:18:54,791 --> 02:18:59,791
Now adjust the pro their protocol and 
they say that eat all the eggs you want.

2925
02:19:00,131 --> 02:19:03,770
It is now a zero point food,
which is fucking incredible.

2926
02:19:04,060 --> 02:19:05,550
Yeah.
So.

2927
02:19:05,560 --> 02:19:07,810
And the way I don't get hungry as I eat 
a lot of oil,

2928
02:19:07,840 --> 02:19:09,340
like a lot of old oil.
Yes.

2929
02:19:09,400 --> 02:19:12,910
So that keeps that.
So you're basically burning fat.

2930
02:19:12,911 --> 02:19:17,911
You're under like a ketogenic diet and 
it seems to be well and that was 

2931
02:19:18,281 --> 02:19:23,281
complex.
That would have been complicated enough 

2932
02:19:23,281 --> 02:19:23,281
to keep me occupied for the laSt two 
years,

2933
02:19:23,281 --> 02:19:23,950
especially sorting it out with my 
daughter because she.

2934
02:19:24,130 --> 02:19:26,080
Well,
that was quite the bloody nightmare.

2935
02:19:26,081 --> 02:19:27,800
I can tell you.
It was really something,

2936
02:19:28,100 --> 02:19:30,860
but I can't believe she figured it out.
It's amazing.

2937
02:19:30,890 --> 02:19:31,550
It is amazing.

2938
02:19:31,550 --> 02:19:35,000
And she's really.
She's in pretty damn good shape.

2939
02:19:35,001 --> 02:19:37,760
She just had a baby five months ago,
so that was two.

2940
02:19:37,990 --> 02:19:38,660
Yeah,
we're,

2941
02:19:38,890 --> 02:19:39,920
we're stunned.
Man.

2942
02:19:40,490 --> 02:19:43,190
Were stunned because like it was,
it was rough.

2943
02:19:43,280 --> 02:19:45,340
Well,
she sounds like an incredibly extreme is

2944
02:19:45,410 --> 02:19:47,860
quite the tough cookie.
That girl sounds like a.

2945
02:19:48,070 --> 02:19:53,070
Yeah.
Many people are experiencing the same 

2946
02:19:53,070 --> 02:19:54,950
revelation that their diet is what I was
tired all the time.

2947
02:19:54,951 --> 02:19:57,230
I hit a.
I mean I was always very,

2948
02:19:57,231 --> 02:20:01,130
very active so I stayed lean because of 
my physical activity.

2949
02:20:01,131 --> 02:20:06,131
But by the end of the day I need a nap.
I would always take a nap befoRe I'd go 

2950
02:20:06,131 --> 02:20:06,320
to jujitsu.
I was like,

2951
02:20:06,321 --> 02:20:11,321
I have to take a nap or I can't train 
because of carbohydrates boat two hours 

2952
02:20:11,391 --> 02:20:13,760
a day and now I don't nap at all.
Me too.

2953
02:20:13,940 --> 02:20:18,940
Same thing.
That's not exactly true when I've been 

2954
02:20:18,940 --> 02:20:20,801
zooming around,
I take like two minute naps when I'm in 

2955
02:20:20,801 --> 02:20:20,801
the airport or whatever,
but that's also,

2956
02:20:20,801 --> 02:20:21,170
you're probably not getting enough 
sleep,

2957
02:20:21,320 --> 02:20:21,620
right.

2958
02:20:21,880 --> 02:20:22,930
big difference.
Exactly.

2959
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:23,960
So yeah,
it's been,

2960
02:20:23,961 --> 02:20:25,370
it's been remarkable.
So.

2961
02:20:25,640 --> 02:20:29,180
So why did you stop teaching?
Oh,

2962
02:20:29,181 --> 02:20:32,120
well I took a sabbatical because of all 
this.

2963
02:20:32,150 --> 02:20:33,100
Yeah,
well I told the.

2964
02:20:33,200 --> 02:20:35,150
I told my department chair said,
look,

2965
02:20:35,151 --> 02:20:37,400
I had a sabbatical coming up next year.
I said,

2966
02:20:37,401 --> 02:20:38,000
look,
you know,

2967
02:20:39,230 --> 02:20:42,230
there's too much going on.
It'll be better if I take the sabbatical

2968
02:20:42,231 --> 02:20:44,420
this year then I can concentrate on my 
teaching next year.

2969
02:20:44,421 --> 02:20:46,190
So you take the entire year off.
Yeah.

2970
02:20:46,230 --> 02:20:48,220
So you're about eight months in,
is that correct?

2971
02:20:48,230 --> 02:20:48,670
Yeah,
well,

2972
02:20:48,680 --> 02:20:53,680
and I always teach from,
I put all my courses from january to 

2973
02:20:53,680 --> 02:20:53,680
march.
I teach all of them in the same semester

2974
02:20:53,680 --> 02:20:58,190
and that enabled me to concentrate on my
research for the rest of the time and so

2975
02:20:58,520 --> 02:21:01,940
technically I'll be going back teaching 
in january of 2019.

2976
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:03,950
Technically.
Technically you're not convinced.

2977
02:21:04,040 --> 02:21:09,040
Well,
I can't think a year ahead at the 

2978
02:21:09,040 --> 02:21:09,040
moment.

2979
02:21:09,040 --> 02:21:13,630
I don't know what the hell's going on.
I'm not going to go back and teach the 

2980
02:21:13,630 --> 02:21:16,601
same way because see at some point the 
technological transformation means you 

2981
02:21:17,991 --> 02:21:22,820
have to approach things differently.
And so now if I do a lecture online,

2982
02:21:22,821 --> 02:21:25,880
whatever the lecture happens to be,
I can get 150,000

2983
02:21:25,881 --> 02:21:27,440
people to watch it.
That's minimum.

2984
02:21:27,920 --> 02:21:32,240
So the first question would be,
well why would I teach 300 people when I

2985
02:21:32,241 --> 02:21:34,820
can teach 150,000?
That's just stupid,

2986
02:21:34,930 --> 02:21:35,930
right?
Who would do that?

2987
02:21:36,050 --> 02:21:39,030
Those same 300 people are also have 
access to the 50.

2988
02:21:39,350 --> 02:21:40,430
Exactly.
That's right.

2989
02:21:40,431 --> 02:21:42,350
That's exactly it.
And the next thing is,

2990
02:21:42,351 --> 02:21:47,030
well I taped my maps of meaning class 
and my personality class for three years

2991
02:21:47,031 --> 02:21:48,800
running.
It's like it's there.

2992
02:21:49,490 --> 02:21:52,580
Well I could do it again,
but why it's taped.

2993
02:21:52,840 --> 02:21:56,660
I would rather lecture about new things.
So that's what I did this year.

2994
02:21:56,660 --> 02:21:58,850
I did this biblical series which I 
hadn't done before,

2995
02:21:59,150 --> 02:22:04,150
but now if I'm going to lecture again,
I'm going to lecture about different 

2996
02:22:04,150 --> 02:22:07,280
things because because the technology 
has transformed the landscape.

2997
02:22:07,281 --> 02:22:10,730
We're not in 1990 anymore,
not even a little bit.

2998
02:22:10,810 --> 02:22:12,170
Right,
so,

2999
02:22:12,560 --> 02:22:17,560
and this is something that I brought up 
to bret weinstein and I'm hoping he 

3000
02:22:17,560 --> 02:22:17,880
falls along the same line.
Same bet.

3001
02:22:17,930 --> 02:22:20,080
Weinstein,
not steen.

3002
02:22:20,270 --> 02:22:22,160
I make that mistake often.
Sorry brett,

3003
02:22:22,490 --> 02:22:24,590
but same thing,
brilliant guy,

3004
02:22:24,660 --> 02:22:29,660
restricted by his university,
big scandal leaves and I'm hoping he 

3005
02:22:30,721 --> 02:22:35,721
follows the same path because he has so 
much to offer and he has so much to 

3006
02:22:35,721 --> 02:22:38,901
offer for anybody who can get online.
One of the things that's really fun 

3007
02:22:38,901 --> 02:22:41,280
about youtube that and having my 
lectures on youtube,

3008
02:22:41,281 --> 02:22:46,281
is that the only reason people watch 
them is one reason is because they want 

3009
02:22:46,281 --> 02:22:46,281
to learn.

3010
02:22:46,281 --> 02:22:48,240
That's it,
and so it's.

3011
02:22:48,300 --> 02:22:49,260
You might think,
well,

3012
02:22:49,350 --> 02:22:51,600
where is the university?
Well,

3013
02:22:51,601 --> 02:22:53,340
the university is where people wAnt to 
learn.

3014
02:22:53,770 --> 02:22:54,540
It's like,
okay,

3015
02:22:54,840 --> 02:22:59,840
well youtube is the university because 
there's hundreds of thousands of people 

3016
02:22:59,840 --> 02:23:03,330
on youtube,
maybe millions who just want to learn.

3017
02:23:03,450 --> 02:23:04,170
It's like,
fine,

3018
02:23:04,470 --> 02:23:09,470
I'm an educator.
I'll talk to people who want to learn 

3019
02:23:09,470 --> 02:23:09,570
because if you're an educator,
that's what you do.

3020
02:23:10,680 --> 02:23:13,020
Is that most effectively done in the 
universities?

3021
02:23:13,710 --> 02:23:15,190
Not self.
Evidently,

3022
02:23:15,750 --> 02:23:17,340
and so now I'm trying to figure this 
out,

3023
02:23:17,370 --> 02:23:22,370
you know,
like I like my job at the univerSity on 

3024
02:23:22,370 --> 02:23:23,790
uft has treated me well apart from this 
scandal thing,

3025
02:23:23,791 --> 02:23:26,490
but they were kind of taken aback by 
they didn't know what to do about that,

3026
02:23:26,491 --> 02:23:31,491
you know,
it was a new law and wHen I made the 

3027
02:23:31,491 --> 02:23:31,491
video criticizing bill c 16,
I said,

3028
02:23:31,491 --> 02:23:35,370
I think that making this video is 
probably illegal in and of itself.

3029
02:23:35,670 --> 02:23:39,000
Was there controversial moments in your 
career before that?

3030
02:23:39,510 --> 02:23:41,050
No.
Wow.

3031
02:23:41,310 --> 02:23:46,310
No,
I mean it surprised me because I've 

3032
02:23:46,310 --> 02:23:48,921
always,
I would say that the content of my 

3033
02:23:48,921 --> 02:23:52,461
lectures has been a typical,
but it's been a typical in a Good way.

3034
02:23:52,501 --> 02:23:56,820
Like the student responds to my lectures
has always been extremely good,

3035
02:23:57,000 --> 02:24:02,000
extremely good.
I'm always surprised that I was able to 

3036
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:05,481
teach what I'm teaching because I always
thought that it was like insanely 

3037
02:24:05,481 --> 02:24:08,190
revolutionary,
but it was revolutionary in a really,

3038
02:24:08,410 --> 02:24:10,230
like in a scholarly way,
you know,

3039
02:24:10,231 --> 02:24:12,690
like I'm a careful scientist,
I'm a careful thinker.

3040
02:24:12,810 --> 02:24:16,320
I think things all the way through to 
the bottom and I'm really self critical.

3041
02:24:16,321 --> 02:24:19,380
Like when I wrote maps of meaning,
which was my first book,

3042
02:24:20,160 --> 02:24:24,660
I suspect I rewrote every sentence at 
least 15 times.

3043
02:24:24,780 --> 02:24:27,660
It's probably more than that and I 
really literally mean rewrite it.

3044
02:24:27,660 --> 02:24:29,640
So I take the sentence out of the 
paragraph,

3045
02:24:30,060 --> 02:24:32,180
put it in another document,
right,

3046
02:24:32,181 --> 02:24:36,330
like 10 variants of the sentence,
and then pick the one that was best.

3047
02:24:36,480 --> 02:24:39,120
And I did that.
Like it took me 15 years to write.

3048
02:24:39,121 --> 02:24:41,180
I did that over and over and over.
And so what I was,

3049
02:24:41,420 --> 02:24:43,320
I'd write a sentence and then I'd think,
okay,

3050
02:24:44,340 --> 02:24:46,860
have I got all the words,
write every single word.

3051
02:24:46,861 --> 02:24:51,861
Is that the proper words?
The proper phrase is the proper 

3052
02:24:51,861 --> 02:24:52,620
sentence.
Do I believe that this sentence is true?

3053
02:24:52,830 --> 02:24:57,360
Then I'd think of 10 ways I can attack 
it and see if I could break it apart and

3054
02:24:57,420 --> 02:25:02,420
find out what it was wrong and only kept
the ones that I couldn't destroy and 

3055
02:25:02,420 --> 02:25:06,890
like I was going out full force to 
destroy them because I wanted to come up

3056
02:25:07,711 --> 02:25:08,970
with a,
you know,

3057
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,400
come on,
I want it to produce a book that I could

3058
02:25:11,401 --> 02:25:16,401
not break no matter what.
I did and so I spent 15 years on that 

3059
02:25:16,401 --> 02:25:17,280
now.
That was the basis,

3060
02:25:17,281 --> 02:25:20,400
what's the basis for 12 rules for life.
It's been the basis for all the lectures

3061
02:25:20,401 --> 02:25:25,401
I've done and so forth and like I can't 
see where it's wrong and mostly what I 

3062
02:25:25,421 --> 02:25:29,020
was trying to do is to see where it was 
wrong and I can't get underneath it.

3063
02:25:29,021 --> 02:25:29,890
I can't break it.

3064
02:25:30,280 --> 02:25:34,030
That's what's so fascinating to me about
all this stuff and not to.

3065
02:25:36,040 --> 02:25:39,550
Not to overly exaggerate the 
significance of this,

3066
02:25:39,551 --> 02:25:41,230
but just to be completely honest about 
it.

3067
02:25:41,710 --> 02:25:44,530
You're the right guy for the job and 
it's sort of found you.

3068
02:25:44,980 --> 02:25:49,980
It's real weird because there's not a 
lot of people that are that meticulous 

3069
02:25:49,980 --> 02:25:52,270
about their thoughts and about their 
work and about their writing and about.

3070
02:25:52,271 --> 02:25:56,500
They're criticizing their own ideas to 
the point where they break them down,

3071
02:25:56,540 --> 02:25:58,480
try to break them,
trying to tell them apart.

3072
02:25:58,481 --> 02:25:59,500
I had a big problem,

3073
02:26:00,290 --> 02:26:02,450
so when I.
When I started to write maps of meaning,

3074
02:26:02,451 --> 02:26:03,170
I thought,
okay,

3075
02:26:03,290 --> 02:26:05,300
what's the situation?
This is the cold war.

3076
02:26:05,630 --> 02:26:10,630
We've divided into two arm tribal camps 
and we've decided that settling the 

3077
02:26:12,381 --> 02:26:16,130
difference between us is worth risking 
being itself.

3078
02:26:16,490 --> 02:26:21,490
We could,
we could drive everything into 

3079
02:26:21,490 --> 02:26:21,490
extinction.
We're willing to take that chance.

3080
02:26:21,490 --> 02:26:24,650
It's like what the hell is going on?
So I wanted to know two things,

3081
02:26:25,520 --> 02:26:28,790
what was truly driving the tribalism of 
the cold war,

3082
02:26:28,940 --> 02:26:33,940
including it's including the generation 
of that vast nuclear arsenal because 

3083
02:26:33,940 --> 02:26:38,720
that just seemed to me to be insanity 
taken to the final pinnacle.

3084
02:26:39,590 --> 02:26:41,990
So I wanted to know that and I wanted to
know,

3085
02:26:41,991 --> 02:26:44,900
okay,
having figured out why that's happening,

3086
02:26:45,230 --> 02:26:50,230
what could be done about it so it would 
stop and at the same time I was also 

3087
02:26:50,230 --> 02:26:54,941
studying what had happened in auschwitz 
and with the nazis and all of that and 

3088
02:26:54,941 --> 02:26:58,640
so it was a very serious problem and I 
actually wanted to have the answer,

3089
02:26:58,680 --> 02:27:00,020
actually wanted the answer.

3090
02:27:00,500 --> 02:27:02,360
I didn't want to write an interesting 
book about it.

3091
02:27:03,020 --> 02:27:04,730
It wasn't even that I wanted to write a 
book.

3092
02:27:04,731 --> 02:27:09,731
Exactly.
It was just that writing a book was the 

3093
02:27:09,731 --> 02:27:11,060
best way to figure out the problem 
because it's really writing a book is so

3094
02:27:11,061 --> 02:27:11,930
rigorous,
you know,

3095
02:27:11,960 --> 02:27:14,870
cause you think,
but you can only remember so much.

3096
02:27:15,050 --> 02:27:18,020
You have to write it down because then 
you can remember way more and you can.

3097
02:27:18,021 --> 02:27:23,021
Right.
And then the next day you can go back 

3098
02:27:23,021 --> 02:27:23,021
and think,
okay,

3099
02:27:23,021 --> 02:27:23,021
I'm going to take that goddamn argument 
apart.

3100
02:27:23,021 --> 02:27:25,190
I'm going to see if there's anything 
about it this week.

3101
02:27:25,880 --> 02:27:28,400
And so.
And I think I did figure it out.

3102
02:27:28,430 --> 02:27:29,870
I think I did figure it out.
So.

3103
02:27:30,360 --> 02:27:31,460
And then when I,
when I.

3104
02:27:32,250 --> 02:27:37,250
Well,
and then I started lecturing about it 

3105
02:27:37,250 --> 02:27:37,250
and the lectures were always 
unbelievably well regarded.

3106
02:27:37,250 --> 02:27:42,011
Like people,
the kids in the classes would always 

3107
02:27:42,011 --> 02:27:42,011
write for the evaluations.
At the end of the year,

3108
02:27:42,011 --> 02:27:44,570
80 percent of them would say,
and this happened for 20 years,

3109
02:27:44,610 --> 02:27:47,840
say this class changed everything about 
the way I look at the world.

3110
02:27:47,960 --> 02:27:48,650
It's like,
yeah,

3111
02:27:48,651 --> 02:27:50,630
that's what happened to me too.
And I wrote that book.

3112
02:27:50,631 --> 02:27:53,420
It's like I didn't think the same way at
all when I was done.

3113
02:27:54,050 --> 02:27:56,510
I started to understand what these 
ancient stories meant.

3114
02:27:56,511 --> 02:27:59,300
It was like shocking.
Never recovered from it.

3115
02:28:00,220 --> 02:28:02,080
Well listen,
you're out of time.

3116
02:28:03,310 --> 02:28:06,280
Thank you.
Always 12 rules for life.

3117
02:28:06,520 --> 02:28:09,190
An antidote to chaos.
Jordan peterson.

3118
02:28:09,400 --> 02:28:12,610
I made a.
I made a discount for your viewers again

3119
02:28:12,611 --> 02:28:14,410
for the future authoring program.
Okay.

3120
02:28:14,411 --> 02:28:16,120
So what do they have to do?
Rogan.

3121
02:28:16,660 --> 02:28:18,970
Just use rogan and how do they get.
Get to the website.

3122
02:28:19,250 --> 02:28:20,890
[inaudible] dot com.
Okay.

3123
02:28:20,960 --> 02:28:21,830
Yep.
Yep.

3124
02:28:21,920 --> 02:28:22,040
And

3125
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:27,040
I'll send you a link for that.
Thanks a lot to say and also thanks for 

3126
02:28:27,040 --> 02:28:30,011
everything really.
You were the portal into this weird 

3127
02:28:30,011 --> 02:28:31,820
world that I'm in and people say that 
all the time.

3128
02:28:31,830 --> 02:28:32,660
They come up and say,
look,

3129
02:28:32,661 --> 02:28:37,661
I heard about you on joe rogan spike in 
like thousands of people have told me 

3130
02:28:37,661 --> 02:28:38,930
that.
So it's been an honor.

3131
02:28:39,200 --> 02:28:40,010
I appreciate it,
sir.

3132
02:28:40,070 --> 02:28:40,970
Thank you.
You bet.
