1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,880
Her low freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:07,140
You can whip those people up and get on
their frequency and then there's smart

3
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:09,060
people that can be manipulated.

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,120
They can be manipulated once they
attach themselves to an ideology.

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:12,360
Yup.

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,970
Like we were talking about like people
on the left that are avoiding all the

7
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:16,140
craziness about Hillary.

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,720
Like you had a quote that I really
liked that's on your Twitter.

9
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:23,700
You know that if like Hillary was a man
that had done the all the same things

10
00:00:23,701 --> 00:00:24,350
that she like,

11
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:24,961
what is the quote?

12
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:25,794
What does it your exact,

13
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:26,480
I see,

14
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,270
remember I said a,

15
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:31,830
if Hillary was a male republican
with the exact same voting record,

16
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,170
all of her supporters would
hate her with a passion.

17
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:34,800
Yeah,

18
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,220
it's true.

19
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,190
And it's 100% sure.

20
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,033
100% true.

21
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,520
I mean it's not,

22
00:00:38,521 --> 00:00:40,320
this is not controversial in any way,

23
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,340
shape or form.

24
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,330
Hillary is is,

25
00:00:42,331 --> 00:00:42,631
you know,

26
00:00:42,631 --> 00:00:44,580
I mean the stuff I was saying before,

27
00:00:44,581 --> 00:00:45,414
but she's,

28
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,160
she's like courting the left.

29
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,220
She's courting people who are
supposed to be liberals and you'll go,

30
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,520
she's supported every
single war of my lifetime,

31
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:54,990
every single war.

32
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,000
Well now they know they can get past that.

33
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,030
She didn't support gay marriage up
until 2013 even their pet issues.

34
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:02,690
Yeah,

35
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:03,120
it's,

36
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,870
she's,

37
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,430
she's a weird one man.

38
00:01:05,431 --> 00:01:06,420
She's a really,

39
00:01:06,421 --> 00:01:07,320
really weird one.

40
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:08,940
That fucking Libya thing.

41
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,841
We came,

42
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:10,560
we saw,

43
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,490
he died

44
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,100
like,

45
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,180
that's okay.

46
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,710
Like are you kidding me?

47
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,850
What you remember when,

48
00:01:17,851 --> 00:01:18,060
uh,

49
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,980
the fucking Vermont Guy Screamed?

50
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,030
I know I got to

51
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,390
Howard Dean and that one yell did men it,

52
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:26,970
that's it.

53
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:27,751
They saw it and they're like,

54
00:01:27,751 --> 00:01:28,770
fuck this guy.

55
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:29,640
We,

56
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,473
we came,

57
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,190
we saw he died.

58
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,430
Ha ha ha.

59
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,410
Like that doesn't,

60
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,450
you don't think that
lady is fucking crazy.

61
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,060
You don't think that ladies fucking cars.

62
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:39,391
I mean,

63
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:40,260
you're down for her.

64
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,100
That's,

65
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,800
that is a completely an ideology thing.

66
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:44,400
You,

67
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:44,910
she's,

68
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,080
she's on your team.

69
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:46,741
You're going to,

70
00:01:46,741 --> 00:01:49,110
you're going to go along with
it just like it's a religion.

71
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:49,944
Just like you're,

72
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,490
you're subscribing to
some predetermined thing.

73
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:53,971
It's,

74
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:54,171
it's,

75
00:01:54,171 --> 00:01:55,004
it's just,

76
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,580
it's weird for me to see,

77
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,121
first of all,

78
00:01:57,121 --> 00:01:59,160
it's weird that she wants to be president.

79
00:01:59,580 --> 00:01:59,761
Like,

80
00:01:59,761 --> 00:02:00,900
aren't you old?

81
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,220
Like you're an old lady.

82
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:03,480
How much energy do you have?

83
00:02:03,481 --> 00:02:04,380
Got a ton of money.

84
00:02:04,381 --> 00:02:05,940
You just had your first grandkid.

85
00:02:05,941 --> 00:02:07,200
You've got like perspective,

86
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,400
like what it'll you're trying to do.

87
00:02:08,401 --> 00:02:09,750
We're trying to make history as a woman.

88
00:02:09,751 --> 00:02:10,584
Is that what it is?

89
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,071
I mean,

90
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:13,830
do you want to just like get back at
your husband for getting his Dick Sucked

91
00:02:13,831 --> 00:02:15,960
and in 1991 or whatever the fucking was?

92
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,231
Yeah.

93
00:02:16,231 --> 00:02:16,471
I mean,

94
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:17,490
I don't even think it's that.

95
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:17,961
I think it's,

96
00:02:17,961 --> 00:02:18,510
it's,

97
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:18,760
I mean,

98
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,720
who knows who I,

99
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:19,980
you know,

100
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,060
I'm not in their head,

101
00:02:21,061 --> 00:02:26,061
but I think these people are like power
brokers that just want more and more of

102
00:02:26,431 --> 00:02:27,510
it and it's a real,

103
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:32,590
it is probably a thrill unlike anything
we could imagine to have that much power

104
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:35,611
and they've,

105
00:02:35,611 --> 00:02:36,930
they've tasted a little bit of that,

106
00:02:36,931 --> 00:02:37,520
you know?

107
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:37,790
Yeah.

108
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,060
Just,

109
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:42,630
it seems to me that she's like so old
that she would just want to chill,

110
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:43,740
you know?

111
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,450
It just doesn't make any sense to me.

112
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,050
She's,

113
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,220
she's an old lady.

114
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,930
Like she doesn't have good health.

115
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,730
I think that was the other
thing that concerned with,

116
00:02:50,731 --> 00:02:51,750
she had some health issues.

117
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:53,940
Right then she had like
concussions or something.

118
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:54,830
Yeah.

119
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,010
There was hit in the head.

120
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,180
I forget what it was,

121
00:02:57,181 --> 00:02:59,010
but it was to beat the
fuck out of our imagine.

122
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,730
Turns out that bill just wailed on her
and she wants to keep it quiet until

123
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:04,610
fucking Kot.

124
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,910
He's been accused of violence.

125
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,331
Wow.

126
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:11,830
She has suffered from fainting spells
since at least 2005 and that year she

127
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:13,230
passed out presumably so,

128
00:03:13,231 --> 00:03:16,960
or while giving a speech in 2012 she
passed out yet again and suffered a

129
00:03:16,961 --> 00:03:17,794
concussion.

130
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:18,970
Holy Fuck.

131
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,790
Presumably sober is something
that if they ever have to say it,

132
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,653
it's just not good.

133
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:22,751
Yeah.

134
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:23,560
You got issues.

135
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,210
We're always presumably sober.

136
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,770
I'm not usually pursuing,

137
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:27,701
but all right.

138
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:28,390
You know,

139
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:33,190
but this idea that she fell asleep
and and hit her fucking head,

140
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,470
like when people fall and hit their head,

141
00:03:35,471 --> 00:03:38,740
it's one of the worst things about getting
knocked out is not getting punched in

142
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:39,370
the head.

143
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,710
It's you falling down and getting
hit in the head with the earth.

144
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,560
Yeah.

145
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,060
Like their,

146
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,680
their heads bounce off the ground.

147
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:46,750
That's like a big issue in
street fights and stuff.

148
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:48,220
When you watch someone get sucker punched,

149
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:49,960
they will fall down in their head,

150
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:51,220
gets bounced off the curb.

151
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,440
And I think people who have like
epilepsy and things like that,

152
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,940
like that's the big fairly,

153
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,190
what happens is that that you end
up cracking your head on the ground.

154
00:03:57,191 --> 00:04:00,100
It's not just the seizure seizures.

155
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,233
Um,

156
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,080
yeah,

157
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,913
there's,

158
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,120
there's something,

159
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,043
I don't know,

160
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,460
Hillary Clinton said recently,

161
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,400
and this would probably be one of the
tactics she tries to use against Trump,

162
00:04:09,401 --> 00:04:10,780
but she said something along the gut.

163
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,021
She goes,

164
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:11,231
you know,

165
00:04:11,231 --> 00:04:11,980
I just,

166
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,231
I,

167
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:15,190
I don't know if he's the type of guy we
would want having control of the nuclear

168
00:04:15,191 --> 00:04:16,024
codes.

169
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,020
And it's just like an interesting thing
to look at what your like how crazy is

170
00:04:20,021 --> 00:04:22,840
it that any one person has
control of those nuclear codes?

171
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:27,220
Like we're just counting
on one person to not snap,

172
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,280
to not kill the whole world to just,

173
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:29,561
yeah.

174
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:30,700
Hopefully you don't ever just like,

175
00:04:30,701 --> 00:04:31,480
I've had enough.

176
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,313
I'm fucking,

177
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:32,951
yeah.

178
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:33,451
It's the,

179
00:04:33,451 --> 00:04:36,940
the cigarettes and coffee thing
or the staples of the alcoholics,

180
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:37,420
right?

181
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:37,611
Yeah.

182
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,081
A lot of,

183
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:38,770
uh,

184
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:42,430
a people enjoy those cigarettes
and they enjoy those,

185
00:04:42,431 --> 00:04:42,820
uh,

186
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,690
those coffees,

187
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,770
but you know,

188
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:45,670
in their eyes.

189
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:45,851
Yeah.

190
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:46,120
But then,

191
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,901
but in their eyes,

192
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:51,520
they feel like they've got the alcohol
part under wraps now because this stuff

193
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,460
just kind of keeps him going and
this stuff is not ruining their life.

194
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,423
Right.

195
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,410
Alotta alcohol,

196
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,060
she used cannabis the same way.

197
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,720
Um,

198
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,231
and uh,

199
00:04:59,231 --> 00:05:02,050
that's not really accepted by Aa.

200
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,160
So I know a lot,

201
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:08,161
a lot of people who have kicked their
alcoholism by moving more towards

202
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:09,010
cannabis,

203
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:09,843
but again,

204
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,760
within the gay community
that they don't like that,

205
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,650
that's still considered a drug.

206
00:05:14,651 --> 00:05:15,270
So,

207
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:15,800
but you can get it

208
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,910
addicted to anything,

209
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:17,331
you know,

210
00:05:17,331 --> 00:05:22,020
whether it's set porn or dig
MACs or where we can get it,

211
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:22,430
uh,

212
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,870
psychologically addicted to anything.

213
00:05:23,871 --> 00:05:25,310
But Jamie didn't,

214
00:05:25,311 --> 00:05:27,830
the guy who created,

215
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,370
um,

216
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,400
alcoholics anonymous didn't have
positive experiences with LSD.

217
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:33,423
Okay.

218
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,560
That'd be funny.

219
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:34,921
That would be,

220
00:05:34,921 --> 00:05:35,400
I feel like,

221
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,210
I feel like you did acid as the only
thing you're in that to take guys.

222
00:05:38,211 --> 00:05:38,850
So I feel like,

223
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:39,411
I feel like,

224
00:05:39,411 --> 00:05:39,840
uh,

225
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,710
that was something that
happened like maybe even after.

226
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:45,080
Okay.

227
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,380
Well,

228
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,730
I don't want to speak out of school.

229
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:47,580
Yeah,

230
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,080
my right.

231
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,540
Yeah,

232
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,373
I'll pull it up.

233
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:50,361
Yeah.

234
00:05:50,361 --> 00:05:52,730
So what the fuck?

235
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,060
Well,

236
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,980
that's why the government
needs to live testing.

237
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:55,430
Oh,

238
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,241
on a lot of things.

239
00:05:56,241 --> 00:05:57,074
So we know.

240
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,933
Scroll that up please.

241
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:03,130
Alcoholics anonymous foe a founder
believed LSD could cure alcoholism.

242
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,333
Wow.

243
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,750
You've seen so much research now in
psychedelics that clinics are opening up.

244
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:09,830
There's a clinic in,

245
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,090
in La for,

246
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,073
for Acadamin,

247
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:12,801
you know,

248
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:14,910
and you're seeing NDNA clinics opening up.

249
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:15,891
What?

250
00:06:15,891 --> 00:06:18,950
Most of them do not realize
that the program's cofounder,

251
00:06:18,951 --> 00:06:23,951
Bill Wilson credited the psychedelic
drugs LSD for alleviating his alcoholism

252
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:28,280
and believe the drug could be
used to treat others as well.

253
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,293
Holy Shit.

254
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,860
So those friends of bill,

255
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,940
they didn't get all the
information [inaudible] of bill.

256
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:37,010
If you're in the alcoholics anonymous,

257
00:06:37,011 --> 00:06:37,221
right?

258
00:06:37,221 --> 00:06:38,031
That's what they call themselves.

259
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:38,691
Like Ken's a bill.

260
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:41,390
It's like the code w but they
didn't get that experience.

261
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,740
It's kind of like the mushrooms,

262
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:43,970
like quitting cigarettes.

263
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:44,570
Yeah.

264
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,920
But do you think they tell them,

265
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,170
I never heard this before today.

266
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,240
How could you not tell these people?

267
00:06:50,241 --> 00:06:51,390
Wilson first became,

268
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:51,920
uh,

269
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,520
began experimenting with
Lsd in Los Angeles at the
Veterans Administration back

270
00:06:55,521 --> 00:06:56,840
in 1956.

271
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,540
But after taking his first hit of acid,

272
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:04,430
he realized that it was not the aspect
of terror that could help remedy

273
00:07:04,431 --> 00:07:05,211
alcoholism,

274
00:07:05,211 --> 00:07:10,211
but rather the insight one could attain
from stepping into a world of simulated

275
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,270
insanity.

276
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,270
And whoa.

277
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:17,840
Wilson believe that using the LSD could
help the alcoholic discover a power

278
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:22,130
greater than ourselves that in
turn could restore us to sanity.

279
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,151
However,

280
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:26,960
he was adamant that using acid to
combat the demons of alcoholism was not

281
00:07:26,961 --> 00:07:28,100
something that he could,

282
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,380
that one could expect from a single dose.

283
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,580
He's like more research
is required and snacks.

284
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:35,623
Wow.

285
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,470
Hmm.

286
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,221
That's interesting,

287
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:37,610
man.

288
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:38,331
That's interesting.

289
00:07:38,331 --> 00:07:38,471
Yeah.

290
00:07:38,471 --> 00:07:39,141
Psychedelics,

291
00:07:39,141 --> 00:07:42,620
I think as we experiment within,

292
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:44,870
like medically,

293
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:47,150
I going to reveal some secrets.

294
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:48,201
This guy's,

295
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,720
this guy's a heavy duty tripper.

296
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:50,900
They're going further down.

297
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,780
He was tripping with Aldous Huxley.

298
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:54,950
Like this guy.

299
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,840
This isn't like one experience he had.

300
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:57,890
Interesting.

301
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:01,640
There's documentation that
indicates Wilson was involved
with many supervise LSD

302
00:08:01,641 --> 00:08:02,474
trials,

303
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,910
including some with psychology,

304
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,870
a psychologist,

305
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,810
Betty Eisner and brave new world author,

306
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:09,860
Aldous Huxley,

307
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,880
which led them to believe that the
visions and insights given by l LSD could

308
00:08:13,881 --> 00:08:16,040
create a large incentive,

309
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,170
at least in a considerable
number of people.

310
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,150
And so this was with like a leader,

311
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,190
and in fact,

312
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,800
they lift the left this
out of the AA pamphlet.

313
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,430
How do they,

314
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,930
how could they leave this out?

315
00:08:26,931 --> 00:08:27,591
That's crazy.

316
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:32,591
Cause this seems like this had to play
a major part in this guy's ability to

317
00:08:32,691 --> 00:08:33,590
kick alcohol

318
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,720
[inaudible].
