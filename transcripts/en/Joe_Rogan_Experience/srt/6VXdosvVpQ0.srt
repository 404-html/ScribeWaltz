1
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,210
Everybody.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,810
This episode of the podcast is
brought to you by 1-800-FLOWERS,

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:14,700
one 800 flowers.com it's almost
mother's Day fuckers. That's right.

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,730
It's time to send moms some beautiful
rose is something lovely to let her know

5
00:00:20,101 --> 00:00:24,390
that all that pain when she shot you
out of her vagina was not for, not,

6
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,980
not for, not, you're not
allowed to say that. Oh,

7
00:00:26,981 --> 00:00:31,380
you can't say not for not
seems like shitty language.

8
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,200
So did his shot you out of her
vagina. So let's just run with it. Um,

9
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,590
there's still time to send mom a beautiful
rose bouquet from one 800 flowers.com

10
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,780
because mom means so much to you.
You know she does. Without her,

11
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,650
you would not be here. That
is a fact. Think about that.

12
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,890
And for such an important occasion,

13
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:01,130
I trust one 800 flowers.com and right
now one 800 flowers.com is giving my

14
00:01:02,671 --> 00:01:06,360
listeners a free, I feel like I
shouldn't call you my listeners.

15
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,040
That seems a bit Douchey,

16
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,690
almost as Douchey as saying the Joe
Rogan experience when my name is actually

17
00:01:12,691 --> 00:01:16,080
Joe Rogan. So I stopped saying that
so I'm not going to say my listeners.

18
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,600
How about you bitches giving you bitches
a special offer on mother's Day 18

19
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,250

21
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:39,861

for just 10 bucks more they'll make it

22
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:47,271

23
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,350

24
00:01:52,351 --> 00:01:54,150

00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,540
but it's only available today,
Tuesday,

26
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:02,660

because this shit's going to fly off the

27
00:02:04,381 --> 00:02:07,500
shelf,
so hurry before it is too late.

28
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:12,570
Go to one 800 flowers.com from
your desktop or mobile device.

29
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,220
Click on the radio microphone in the
upper right hand corner and enter in j r e

30
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,430
that's one 800 flowers.com and enter j r
e or call 1-800-FLOWERS and mention j r

31
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,880
e we are also brought to you by ting.

32
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:35,150
Ting is a mobile company that does things
on their own terms and their own terms

33
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:40,881
is they decided to cut out all the
nonsense that's usually associated with

34
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,160
owning a cell phone and
having cell phone coverage.

35
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:48,690
Things like early termination fees,
things like contracts,

36
00:02:48,691 --> 00:02:53,670
things like charging you for x amount
of minutes and if you get over that,

37
00:02:53,671 --> 00:02:55,890
it's an overage freed.
The way Tim handles it,

38
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,970
it's much cleaner and in my opinion
it's, it's more, it's just more ethical.

39
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,820
Look, cell phone companies know
they have you by the balls.

40
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,040
He needed a cell phone.
Everybody does.

41
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:09,430
If you're one of those
fucking weird contrarians,

42
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:12,760
it's like I don't even own a cell
phone. Guess what? Fuck face.

43
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,550
You're behind the curve. That
shit's ridiculous. If you're,

44
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,900
it's 2014 if you don't have a cell phone,
there's something wrong with you. Okay,

45
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:24,600
it's you, you're the problem. But
if you do have a cell phone, you,

46
00:03:24,601 --> 00:03:28,030
you know the pitfalls. Ting eliminates
almost all of them. First of all,

47
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,550
they buy time on the sprint backbone.

48
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,120
So what they do is they
rent sprint service. So,

49
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:37,780
and then they sell it back to you. But
they do it in a really simple, easy way.

50
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:40,210
Instead of saying you get x
amount of minutes per month,

51
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:45,520
you just pay for what you use.
If you use more, you pay more.

52
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:50,170
If you use less, you pay
less. And 98% of people,

53
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,500
98% would save money with Ting.

54
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:58,810
And that is clearly just because
they do mobile differently.

55
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:04,020
$440 is the average annual savings per
device for a business with 11 to 20

56
00:04:06,311 --> 00:04:10,240
employees. Think about that
shit. And they have great phones.

57
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:15,100
You can bring over I phones from
sprint, iPhone four, iPhone five,

58
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,800
you can buy one of their
awesome android devices.

59
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:20,470
They all have the top of the line.
Android phones.

60
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:24,220
They have the Samsung Galaxy note three,

61
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:26,820
which is what I have with Tim now. I, I,

62
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,420
I poured my galaxy note
over to 10. Now, um,

63
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,250
they have the HTC one, they have, um,

64
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,450
all sorts of different options
and even they've gone old school.

65
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:41,230
You can buy one of those old fucking
flip phones if you're into it.

66
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:46,090
They have all kinds of
different styles and different,

67
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,570
different options for both. Uh, the, the,

68
00:04:49,571 --> 00:04:54,430
the type of phone you have and
the, um, and the, the way you,

69
00:04:54,431 --> 00:04:55,540
uh,
do you use your phone.

70
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,910
If you're one of those people that really
likes to use a flip phone and we were

71
00:04:57,911 --> 00:04:58,870
talking about the other day,

72
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,890
there's a benefit and there's something
cool about being able to open it and

73
00:05:02,891 --> 00:05:07,120
then shut it when the phone's off like
I'm done with you close that phone.

74
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,630
You don't get that by pressing
your thumb on glass. You also,

75
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,500
you don't get that same feeling you get
when you actually press a button to type

76
00:05:14,501 --> 00:05:19,270
a number. I do miss that. There's a
benefit in that, but that's all nonsense.

77
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,350
You could get that anywhere.

78
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:25,390
The bottom line is what you can get with
ting is no bullshit cell phone service,

79
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:29,620
excellent coverage because they use the
sprint backbone and you can get really

80
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:32,770
good phones and you can cut out all
the nonsense where you, you don't,

81
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,310
you don't feel like you're
getting fucked over, you know,

82
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,190
and I think that's like one of the most
important things about what ting offers.

83
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,420
I think every cell phone service in the
future is going to have to shift over to

84
00:05:43,421 --> 00:05:47,770
the, their model of pricing because
I think the idea of you, you know,

85
00:05:47,771 --> 00:05:50,740
you're only getting a certain amount of
minutes and if you get over that they

86
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:54,910
charge you for it. Like that's all
stupid. Just pay for what you use.

87
00:05:54,911 --> 00:05:58,040
And if you use very little, you
pay very little. And as I said,

88
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:00,650
for most people you would
save money with Ting,

89
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,430
98% of people that's,
that's quite a claim.

90
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,200
The other thing I like about ting is on
their second anniversary, for no reason,

91
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:13,310
they just decided to slash prices they
slash their prices because they got a

92
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:16,970
better offer. They decided, hey,
let's celebrate two years in business.

93
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,230
Let's celebrate,
uh,

94
00:06:18,231 --> 00:06:22,880
an ethic that people seem to be resonating
with and let's just slashed prices.

95
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:26,000
And it's particularly
beneficial for power users.

96
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:27,320
So if you're one of those dudes,

97
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:32,000
it's on Twitter all day and downloading
videos and that kind of Shit Tengiz for

98
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:32,420
you.

99
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:37,420
So go to rogan.ting.com and save $25 off

00:06:39,861 --> 00:06:44,570
That's rogan.ting.com we're
also brought to you by on it.

102
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:50,080
Oh and and I t on it is what we
call a human optimization website.

103
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,600
What we try to carry and sell is all
the best things that we can find.

104
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,230
Whether it is strength and
conditioning equipment,

105
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:03,320
whether it is foods and healthy snacks,

106
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,300
whether it is supplements like Alpha
brain or shroom tech sport or new mood.

107
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:13,540
We try to send you or sell you the
very best nutritional supplements,

108
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:17,930
the very best supplements
as far as protein powders,

109
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:22,610
we carry hemp force protein powder,
which is from Canada, where Nick Cutter,

110
00:07:22,611 --> 00:07:27,611
Aka Craig Davidson is from
the fine land of Canada,

111
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,820
is allowed to grow and sell hemp to
these dullards in America that aren't

112
00:07:31,821 --> 00:07:34,400
allowed to grow their own
because they're fucking goofy.

113
00:07:34,401 --> 00:07:38,690
Government forbids it because,
because hemp knows marijuana.

114
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:41,060
They're like cousins.
They know each other real well.

115
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:44,330
It's fucking government doesn't trust him.
It's too close,

116
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,300
too close to that marijuana criminal.
Um,

117
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:50,570
you do not test positive is a big
question I get, I'd have to answer it.

118
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:55,280
I have to talk about it every time.
You do not test positive for THC,

119
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,530
if you by hemp,
uh,

120
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,030
I have to say this because the
fucking retards that run the,

121
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:06,350
uh, what is it at customs
and New Zealand's, oh my God,

122
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,550
you dummies.

123
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:11,660
I had a friend who ordered some
shit in New Zealand and customs.

124
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,290
They took and destroyed his
hemp force protein powder.

125
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,810
You dummies. It's probably
some thieves. The customers,

126
00:08:19,811 --> 00:08:21,130
they probably stole it and they're,

127
00:08:21,131 --> 00:08:23,750
they're probably making their own protein
shakes now and laugh and they're dicks

128
00:08:23,751 --> 00:08:26,540
off.
But according to him,

129
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:30,680
what they said was that they confiscated
and destroyed his hemp force because

130
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:32,210
they thought it was a marijuana product.

131
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:37,970
We live in a time that
will be mocked one day,

132
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
mocked the same way we mock powdered
wigs and putting skirts over a tables the

133
00:08:44,571 --> 00:08:48,230
way they used to put table leg dresses
in the olden days to keep people from

134
00:08:48,231 --> 00:08:52,460
getting impure thoughts. They will
mock us, they will mock us for this,

135
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,740
this thing that we have with him,
but we sell it.

136
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,440
And if you're in America or in
a country that's not retarded,

137
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,750
you can buy it and you can
eat it and it's good for you.

138
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,090
But you should know that.

139
00:09:03,091 --> 00:09:05,520
You can test positive for
some things that aren't drugs.

140
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:09,600
Like if you eat poppy seed bagels,
you will test positive for heroin.

141
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:12,600
I know it sounds crazy,
but it is true. Um,

142
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,450
the other things that we carry it on it,
things like warrior bar,

143
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,770
which is one of our new products,

grams of fat, excuse me.

171
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,740
you got to read this book. This book
is fucked up. You're going to love it.

172
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:09,140
Cause he knows I love Stephen
King and that, you know,

173
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,750
that that's sort of twisted genre.

174
00:11:11,751 --> 00:11:16,120
So He sends me this book right here.
Yeah,

175
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,660
it's in my bag here somewhere.
Uh, he sends me Your Book and uh,

176
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:24,520
I enjoy the fucking shit out of it. I am,
I want, I want to pull it out because, um,

177
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:29,420
it's so beat up and dogeared
proves, oh, there we go.

178
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:33,350
Troop. And, uh, I guess I'm about,

179
00:11:33,351 --> 00:11:37,690
what am I about 200 plus pages into
it. Um, it's really getting juicy.

180
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:41,720
I really, I'm really enjoying
it, man. Good. It's really
good. Good, good. And it's,

181
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,060
it's really fun and it's,
you know,

182
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:49,390
it's a long the lines of like stand by
me or one of those classic old Stephen

183
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,670
King Books.
You like the stand or,

184
00:11:55,180 --> 00:12:00,180
or pet cemetery where it's just twisted
and dark and there's psychological shit

185
00:12:01,781 --> 00:12:06,781
going on and there's horrific things
having those monsters and it's really

186
00:12:07,031 --> 00:12:11,080
fucking cool man. And um,
when he sent it to me,

187
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:14,170
he told me that Nick Carter wasn't
your real name. And I was like,

188
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:18,820
well, what's, what's the deal there? Yeah.
What is, what's the deal there? Well, um,

189
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,840
you know, I think the most concerning
thing to me would be, is it anyone,

190
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:26,860
cause I mean, I grew up like
you, like Stephen King is
my idol. Steve, there is no,

191
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:29,410
nobody. I've read more than
Stephen King and beyond that,

192
00:12:29,411 --> 00:12:34,080
like I grew up as a horror reader. I
mean I have read everything now. I see.

193
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:37,110
You mean you started diversify but I
wouldn't even say diversify cause that's

194
00:12:37,111 --> 00:12:41,770
sort of like, I love the horror
genre stole like Clive Barker,

195
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,440
obviously Stephen King,
Peter Straub, Robert Hart.

196
00:12:44,441 --> 00:12:47,500
Mccammon I mean the list goes on and
on and on that we started who I cut my

197
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:51,340
teeth on. So, um, so really
my agents said, listen,

198
00:12:51,341 --> 00:12:54,830
you've been writing these things under
your own name and their kind of their,

199
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,860
I wouldn't even classify them as literary,

200
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,430
but maybe they would be a little more
to that side. Uh, rather than, than,

201
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:04,570
than the horror genre. And, um, he sort of
felt like, listen, people aren't going to,

202
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:08,920
people might be confused or,
or people might, you know,

203
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,840
let's have some separation basically.

204
00:13:10,841 --> 00:13:14,650
And the best way to do this separation
is just to give you a new name, put this,

205
00:13:14,651 --> 00:13:16,900
put this horror work.
Cause when I sent him the truth,

206
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:20,380
I mean there's no way it's anything other
than just like I wanted to write like

207
00:13:20,381 --> 00:13:24,520
an eighties style hard fireball
and sort of horror novel,

208
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:27,280
like not splitting any hairs,
not trying to like make,

209
00:13:27,281 --> 00:13:30,400
make it met ironic or anything.
Just trying to go straight ahead.

210
00:13:30,401 --> 00:13:32,680
The horror that I grew up,
you know, loving, you know,

211
00:13:32,681 --> 00:13:37,180
and try and sort of be an homage to,
to, to those writers in that time. Um,

212
00:13:37,181 --> 00:13:39,460
so there's no doubt it was going to
come out as clearly a horror novel.

213
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:43,760
So he said, let's, let's just
make up a pseudonym. And I, I'm,

214
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:48,310
I wouldn't say I'm new to this, but you
know, you know, you have an agent as well.

215
00:13:48,311 --> 00:13:50,320
And like, I mean, I trust my agent. I'm,

216
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,160
I imagine in most cases you trust
your agent. Maybe not always.

217
00:13:53,161 --> 00:13:54,700
You don't trust them at all?
No.

218
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:58,760
Then we'll get to talk to me about
that type of thing. Yeah. Yeah.

219
00:13:58,761 --> 00:14:02,980
I don't allow them, well I think
maybe looking back, you know,

220
00:14:02,981 --> 00:14:06,040
what we did is we settled on this
pseudonym and then I quickly went,

221
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,240
it went away,
you know,

222
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:11,410
trying to erase any sort of sentiment
that I was ashamed of it because I think

223
00:14:11,411 --> 00:14:14,240
that's, I live in Toronto and I hang
out with a lot of people in the horror,

224
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,930
the horror genre sort of genre writers.
And their question was like,

225
00:14:16,931 --> 00:14:19,920
are you ashamed? I'm like,
fuck no. That would be the,

226
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:23,140
if that would be the worst thing for
me, for people to think that, you know,

227
00:14:23,141 --> 00:14:25,990
cause I'm as proud as what I've done is
the troop is any other writing I've ever

228
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:26,824
done.

229
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,320
Well, so when you say literary,
like what are your other books?

230
00:14:29,321 --> 00:14:31,370
I'm not familiar with
your other brother books.

231
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:36,120
Well, I wrote a book called Rustin
Bone, which is like a, a book, uh, um,

232
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:41,070
the short yeah. Short stories. Um, uh, and
then I wrote a book called the fighter,

233
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,820
not, not the same a fighter, the
Christian Bale movie, but, um,

234
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,280
and I wrote a book just
recently called Cataract City,

235
00:14:47,281 --> 00:14:52,010
which is so it's sort of like, I dunno,
um, I wouldn't say chuck, he was an early

236
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,970
influence, but sort of like
macho, like fighting, boxing,

237
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:58,400
dogfighting, repossession, you know,

238
00:14:58,401 --> 00:15:02,300
those were sort of the things really
sort of manly endeavors that they were,

239
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:05,720
I was concerned about it, interested
in with those books, but they weren't,

240
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:06,471
you know,

241
00:15:06,471 --> 00:15:09,860
they certainly weren't literary like
Alice Munro or something like that.

242
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:14,480
I Dunno who else. She's a kid.
She's a Canadian, uh, you know,

243
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:19,370
a Canadian short story writer,
like a Salmon Rushdie or
you know, a Phillip Roth.

244
00:15:19,371 --> 00:15:23,510
Those kind of like serious
literary writers know about
Salman Rushdie is a bunch

245
00:15:23,511 --> 00:15:25,640
of Muslims. Really Mad.
Don't like that dude.

246
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:30,670
Pat Stevens was on their side and
disappointed and he was finally allowed to

247
00:15:30,831 --> 00:15:34,820
stick his head up after, I don't know,
like they put a fat lie out on him. Right.

248
00:15:34,821 --> 00:15:39,440
He's it as the fallow, I think. I
think the guy you who put it out died.

249
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:42,200
So I think the fat white died with
him or maybe they carried it over.

250
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,440
I don't really know how that works,
but he has showing up at public functions,

251
00:15:45,441 --> 00:15:50,030
so I think he's less concerned
about being killed. Four guy. Yeah.

252
00:15:50,031 --> 00:15:52,190
You think about like
man of all this stuff.

253
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,130
Could you imagine someone puts a fatwa
on you for something that you say during

254
00:15:55,131 --> 00:15:59,010
the podcast are ridiculous. Yeah. I
know whoever did it and I'd kill them

255
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:04,640
first before you can just kill the
guy in the fatwa ends. That's, yeah,

256
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,150
you're fucked. Yeah, exactly.

257
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,500
They shouldn't be putting out too
many fat was because it's like,

258
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,560
I'm going to get you, it's
the day and age. You can't
hide behind a fatwa anymore.

259
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:16,280
No, exactly. Today's Internet, they
can find you, but I can find you too.

260
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:20,650
You could publicly expose them for
their fatwa shaming. Right. Um,

261
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,100
so I don't, I'm not familiar
with Salman Rushdie's work.

262
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:28,780
I've read a little bit of it and I found
it quite boring to me, honestly. Yeah,

263
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:32,720
I think, I think too, there's somewhat
with literary writing, like I had to,

264
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,840
I had to read it because you went
to school and did an English degree.

265
00:16:35,841 --> 00:16:38,120
So I feel like there like medicine,

266
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,670
it's like it's not
necessarily it's good for you.

267
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,280
There's this sense of like you should
be reading it because it's good for you

268
00:16:43,281 --> 00:16:46,850
and it'll make you a better person.
But I'm sort of, I'm past all that now.

269
00:16:46,851 --> 00:16:49,920
I'd just like to read what I like to
read and if that happens to be, you know,

270
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:54,650
sort of crunchy literary fiction
where it's like dense text we'll find.

271
00:16:54,651 --> 00:16:55,251
But if it's,

272
00:16:55,251 --> 00:16:58,460
if it's something like a really good
horror novel or a thriller novel,

273
00:16:58,461 --> 00:17:02,780
I mean I'm all over that too. As far as
I'm concerned. When it comes to fiction,

274
00:17:02,781 --> 00:17:05,150
whether it's a film or
whether it's a book,

275
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:10,040
I only want to be entertained totally.
Or not illuminating. Elucidate,

276
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:15,680
enriching me with your or not. I agree.
But I went, you know, you go to school,

277
00:17:15,681 --> 00:17:18,380
right? And you have too much
time on your hands, right? Yeah.

278
00:17:18,381 --> 00:17:20,270
You wake up in the morning
and what do you have to do?

279
00:17:20,271 --> 00:17:22,820
Maybe go to a class for two hours a day.
Um,

280
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:26,660
and so I think people in
that realm feel like they,

281
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:31,250
cause they had the time to like invest
in like really crunchy mind sort of

282
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,250
melting. No distinction that
really tests you but and you know,

283
00:17:34,251 --> 00:17:36,740
and then they start to look down on
someone who just wants to read. Like,

284
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:40,830
like for example, I didn't mention at
all in my first one, I did a um, uh,

285
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:41,750
my English degree.

286
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,990
You wouldn't talk about Stephen King
because he's got these sort of looks like,

287
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:49,680
oh, him. Oh well yeah, I used to
read him when I was 12 mocked. Yeah.

288
00:17:49,681 --> 00:17:52,950
He gets mocked and I was like, you know,
after awhile you're just like, wait a sec,

289
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,890
fuck off. You know, like
I love Stephen King.

290
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:59,700
I love a lot of writers that you
guys seem to think are, you know,

291
00:17:59,701 --> 00:18:03,000
base or bullet below your esteem
and who are you in the first place?

292
00:18:03,001 --> 00:18:04,860
We're just sitting in
some writing workshop.

293
00:18:04,861 --> 00:18:08,100
You haven't published the Goddamn thing.
Like not to be an asshole.

294
00:18:08,101 --> 00:18:10,980
I mean I like some of these people that
I'm, that I'm talking about, but like,

295
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,320
you know, yeah, there was,
there was that certain,

296
00:18:13,321 --> 00:18:16,020
that hierarchy and unless
you're reading at this level,

297
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:20,250
but it's like most of people who like
to read have like a job that really

298
00:18:20,251 --> 00:18:23,370
occupies them and they get home at night
maybe and they don't have all that much

299
00:18:23,371 --> 00:18:27,340
energy. They just want to read the, you
know, for enjoyment, you know, and why,

300
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:31,350
why looked down on that. Yeah. And
anytime you're concerned about image,

301
00:18:31,351 --> 00:18:34,110
so much so that you're
ignoring great works.

302
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:39,230
Like Stephen King King wrote some
really fun stuff. Absolutely. And,

303
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:43,230
and really and deeply
psychologically thrilling as well.

304
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,480
You can't dismiss the
stand. No, just can't or,

305
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,360
or it was lot.
And one thing that I noticed too,

306
00:18:51,361 --> 00:18:55,950
like trying to write a horror book is
I think it's really difficult to scare

307
00:18:55,951 --> 00:19:00,360
people in this day and age, right? Like
it's, it's, and so you would probably,

308
00:19:00,361 --> 00:19:00,840
I don't know,

309
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,510
maybe you can answer this a little
bit in terms of liking in comedy.

310
00:19:03,511 --> 00:19:07,440
Like I read Stephen King when I was
12 and I just read them. First of all,

311
00:19:07,441 --> 00:19:11,160
he's the writer that got boys to
read of our generation, you know,

312
00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:14,280
I mean there's nothing else other than
maybe choose your own adventure books

313
00:19:14,281 --> 00:19:18,780
that I was reading back then until I
sort of graduated to Stephen King and um,

314
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,130
and so you first you read it just because
you love Stephen King. And then second,

315
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,090
you know,
I went back as a writer myself and you,

316
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:27,420
you sort of treat the
book is like an engine,

317
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:28,860
the movie mechanic treats and engine.

318
00:19:28,861 --> 00:19:32,130
You're trying to break it down and see
what, what is working, how does this work,

319
00:19:32,131 --> 00:19:33,090
how does he scare you?

320
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:38,100
And that's where you realize it's
genius because it's like, you know,

321
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,700
I'm working on like a model t
Ford and he's got like this,

322
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:44,250
he's working on the Delorean
engine from back to the future.

323
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:48,210
That's how much he's above, you know,
a lot of us in terms of like he is,

324
00:19:48,211 --> 00:19:53,211
he works at a level I think
of like conjuring fear that
is so difficult to first

325
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:58,390
of all, see how it works. Break it down
and then try and do it yourself. Um,

326
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:02,450
and so when you have people like
looking down on him for, for that,

327
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:06,150
I just don't think they've
really interacted with his
work as closely as I have

328
00:20:06,151 --> 00:20:08,220
because first of all, if you're
saying he sucks, I'm like,

329
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:12,330
I can't even touch him in some ways. And
so what are you saying about me? Well,

330
00:20:12,331 --> 00:20:17,331
I just think it's one of those things
where it becomes trendy to say sucks.

331
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:18,600
Yeah.

332
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:23,430
It puts you in this sort of
elevated category of intellectual.

333
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,640
I think that's horseshit because fiction,

334
00:20:26,641 --> 00:20:30,300
like when you start talking
about monsters or vampires,

335
00:20:30,301 --> 00:20:33,660
you're automatically a fool or
you're doing foolish work. Yes. Yeah.

336
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:37,200
Whereas if you're talking about
depression and suicide and you know you're

337
00:20:37,201 --> 00:20:40,770
serious, stop. I'm done with you. Right.

338
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,150
When it comes to like fictional movies,
especially like if someone says,

339
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,010
oh my God, it was an amazing
movie. I cried eyes out.

340
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,150
It was a horrible, not me not going to
see a piece of shit where you make me cry.

341
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:56,080
I don't want to cry. I've plenty of
opportunity to cry. You want to cry?

342
00:20:56,081 --> 00:20:58,810
Watch a documentary on
Rwanda. Okay. Don't,

343
00:20:58,811 --> 00:21:03,811
don't fucking cry because some fake ass
hole made some stupid movie where some

344
00:21:04,151 --> 00:21:06,190
people are pretending
terrible things happening.

345
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,340
You're not going to learn from that.
You're just not,

346
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:14,260
I like to be elevated by my
fiction or at least thrilled. Yeah,

347
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:19,240
totally. I want to cry. No, no, I mean,
and, and I, I completely agree. Um, and,

348
00:21:19,241 --> 00:21:23,650
and so, and want another thing Stephen
King does really well is his childhood.

349
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,920
I don't think there's another writer
to my mind really who writes about

350
00:21:26,921 --> 00:21:31,240
childhood as, as well as Steven King
captures it in like a book, like itch or,

351
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:35,290
or the or, well, the movie, the body
at that became stand by me. You know,

352
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:39,290
he captures that time in a, in a
boy's life, especially that, um,

353
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,960
it's just remarkable. You know what I
mean? And, and uh, so, so I think now too,

354
00:21:43,961 --> 00:21:46,750
I know Patton Oswald did like a, I
think it was, I forget where he did it,

355
00:21:46,751 --> 00:21:50,380
but he did like a long article based on
his admiration really for Stephen King.

356
00:21:50,381 --> 00:21:52,820
So I think now there's a
renaissance, finally, Stephen King.

357
00:21:52,821 --> 00:21:57,250
It's got to be close to 70 now where
people are finding like, okay, this guy's,

358
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,620
this guy's pretty good. Well, again,

359
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:04,360
it's just one of those things people
love calling someone out or they love

360
00:22:04,361 --> 00:22:08,620
shaming someone. They love
diminishing someone's work. They just,

361
00:22:08,621 --> 00:22:13,270
they just enjoy it. Especially
if it elevates them. Yes.

362
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,840
Yeah. Or it's like a hipstery thing. It's
like, well, too many people like this,

363
00:22:16,841 --> 00:22:19,900
it can't be good. Um, because
too many people like it,

364
00:22:19,901 --> 00:22:21,910
and I have to like these sort of offbeat,
well,

365
00:22:21,911 --> 00:22:26,230
haven't you read the offbeat
Peruvian poet? No, I haven't. I mean,

366
00:22:26,231 --> 00:22:30,600
I'm sure he or she is awesome. Maybe,
but maybe not. Maybe not exactly.

367
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:34,090
Someone tried to turn you onto a band
that till they tell you it's amazing and

368
00:22:34,091 --> 00:22:35,230
it's shit.
Yeah.

369
00:22:35,231 --> 00:22:38,800
You got to go down to like a basement
somewhere and they'll be playing to like

370
00:22:38,801 --> 00:22:42,100
five people or does this give you,
they send you all the time.

371
00:22:42,101 --> 00:22:47,101
People send me like a youtube clip
and it's dog eat dog shit music.

372
00:22:47,591 --> 00:22:50,560
And they were like, this is amazing.
This band, there's so nuanced. Yeah,

373
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:51,940
that's right.
That's right.

374
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:55,720
And if you don't end sort of like if
you don't get it then you're out. Yeah.

375
00:22:55,721 --> 00:22:59,320
I guess that's sort of like your
lapse in judgment or ability to really

376
00:22:59,321 --> 00:23:02,500
recognize how good this is and
that's what separates them from you.

377
00:23:02,501 --> 00:23:07,100
It's not complex enough. That's
right. Yeah. Yeah. That's right.

378
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:11,560
Craig. I am lacking in some,
some serious way. You know,

379
00:23:11,561 --> 00:23:12,640
I'm Stephen King.
It's a,

380
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:15,910
it's an interesting comparison that
you said that Stephen King captures

381
00:23:15,911 --> 00:23:19,420
childhood really well cause I think that's
something you did really well in this

382
00:23:19,421 --> 00:23:23,700
book is as as well. Thank
you. You captured this uh,

383
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,380
sort of lord of the flies type scenario.

384
00:23:26,381 --> 00:23:28,300
I don't want to give away
too much of the script. Sure.

385
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:30,950
But when things go awry in the,

386
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:35,050
in the beginning you sort of see this
social hierarchy that's going on and you

387
00:23:35,051 --> 00:23:39,640
see shifts in the social hierarchy
based on the events that take place.

388
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:42,570
And it's, it's quite fascinating. Um,

389
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:46,640
I really wish that you did it under
your own name and I hope like Richard

390
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,240
Bachmann,

391
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,020
Bachmann cry. Why didn't Steven
King do that? Go with Bachman.

392
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,130
Why he did it is because
he was too prolific.

393
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:58,460
Is that what his agent just
said? Listen man, first of all,

394
00:23:58,461 --> 00:24:02,090
like I don't get it man,
cause he's probably got,
cause he's still to this day,

395
00:24:02,091 --> 00:24:06,470
he's still pumping out books
at an enormous rate and
big like slobber knocking

396
00:24:06,471 --> 00:24:09,020
books. He's not, you
know, little tiny. Uh,

397
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,480
so I think he probably
writes like me on a good day,

398
00:24:11,481 --> 00:24:13,040
I can write like maybe 3000 words.

399
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:16,370
That's if like the pistons are firing
really well and I try and write a thousand

400
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:19,220
words every day. You know,
that's sort of my, my limit.

401
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:23,510
But he must write like 5,000 words
a day consistently. And it's strong,

402
00:24:23,511 --> 00:24:28,400
strong stuff. So, so that was why Bachman
came to be, because his agent was like,

403
00:24:28,401 --> 00:24:31,640
listen, we just can't be flooding the
market. We Stephen King, we got to,

404
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,990
let's separate you out.

405
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:36,780
Let's just put some of these stuff out
under a different name. And then you know,

406
00:24:36,781 --> 00:24:40,250
you still have your book out every year,
which is still on an astronomical rate.

407
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:43,160
So, yeah, it was just for him.
It was a totally a sense of,

408
00:24:43,161 --> 00:24:46,130
he just had too much to say.
Wow. Yeah. That's amazing.

409
00:24:46,131 --> 00:24:50,100
And he eventually took those Bachman books
and put them under Stephen King. Yeah.

410
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:52,940
Yeah. It became like an open secret
really. You know, and you're right.

411
00:24:52,941 --> 00:24:56,320
Then he republished them under
under his own name basically was um,

412
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:01,840
what was the movie that they did where
it was the dark half Bachman book?

413
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,030
I'm not sure,
but it was based on really,

414
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:07,940
it was based at Richard Stark
or George Stark was his,

415
00:25:07,941 --> 00:25:10,980
his pseudonym and that that's when it's
student and started started stocking.

416
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:12,470
Right. Yeah. Yeah.

417
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,690
That was definitely based
on his experience having
written under a pseudonym. Um,

418
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,870
I, that might've been a
Bachman book. Um, but the,

419
00:25:19,871 --> 00:25:23,960
there was another example
of his, his, you know,

420
00:25:23,961 --> 00:25:28,961
ability to sort of not just be so prolific
but also be prolific under like some

421
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:33,800
really established territory
with its forced his work.

422
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,860
He was always a writer.
Yes.

423
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,610
How many times did he do a book about
a writer character? Yeah. Yeah. I know.

424
00:25:40,611 --> 00:25:44,000
I think it's because the narrative is
easier to write from that perspective.

425
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:47,660
You know, even the voice that you
find, I think it's like I'm a writer,

426
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:49,370
this voices,
because I was reading,

427
00:25:49,371 --> 00:25:53,030
rereading the body lately made
into stand by me and that's again,

428
00:25:53,031 --> 00:25:56,840
that's a writer character who's
writing that. And um, you're right,

429
00:25:56,841 --> 00:25:58,640
he does have a lot of writer characters,

430
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:01,160
which is something I've avoided
up to this point. But you know,

431
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:05,270
looking at the success, what's that? A
lot of writers in Maine, what's all, yeah,

432
00:26:05,271 --> 00:26:08,510
you're right. It's almost
all set in Maine. He started
staked out that territory.

433
00:26:08,511 --> 00:26:12,050
Absolutely. As have you ever
been to Maine? I've never,

434
00:26:12,051 --> 00:26:15,890
I used to live in New Brunswick,
which is right sort of right above main,

435
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,380
but I never crossed the border
and went down into Stephen King,

436
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,830
terrorized stupid. I should have,
there's some beautiful parts of Maine,

437
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:26,060
but the there I don't want,
I want to be kind if I can.

438
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:29,010
There's some of the dumbest
human beings on the phone

439
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:34,010
saying they'll take disrespect at that.
If I was being unkind,

440
00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:39,011
I would call them a bunch of kid
fucking Weirdos that live in the woods.

441
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,980
Um, not all of them. And there's
those great parts of Maine.

442
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,100
Bangor is a great city.

443
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:44,993
Yeah. Uh, the,

444
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:49,230
the real problem with Maine is there's
some areas where there's nothing.

445
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:52,200
Like there's an area between
Portland, Maine, and Bangor.

446
00:26:52,201 --> 00:26:56,400
When you're driving up from Boston where
you go at least an hour without seeing

447
00:26:56,401 --> 00:26:59,820
anything driving 70 miles an hour
and no radio, there's nothing. Oh,

448
00:26:59,821 --> 00:27:03,270
you can't even catch a station,
won't get anything that is just sled.

449
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,390
You hit scan and you're
fucking radio starts smoking.

450
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:11,310
It just keeps going. There's nothing,
I mean, I don't know how it is now.

451
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,470
There's no radio, there's
no gas stations, man.

452
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:17,910
There's just a straight shot of like
70 miles of just, I've just dairy road,

453
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:21,510
pine trees or whenever. If you run out
of gas, you're fucked. Ceville oh man.

454
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:24,870
And if it's snowing out,
you're really fucked. Yeah.

455
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:28,800
We used to do that drive all the time
cause we do gigs up in Bangor. Oh, okay.

456
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:33,300
If you made fun of Maine, even
at all. I mean even slightly,

457
00:27:33,301 --> 00:27:36,600
the pitchforks are coming
up and scream at you.

458
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:38,870
You call them maniacs if you
called the maniacs. Correct.

459
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:43,320
Get up and get fucking Naheed mangy they,
they love it.

460
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,630
They love it up there.
It's beautiful.

461
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,260
It's absolutely beautiful country and
you know they have everything up there.

462
00:27:49,261 --> 00:27:50,240
Deer and Moose.

463
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:53,150
Yeah. It's like great that way start
if you want to get back to nature,

464
00:27:53,151 --> 00:27:55,070
I feel like that's probably
the place you might start.

465
00:27:55,071 --> 00:27:56,680
You want to be a survivalist.
Yeah.

466
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:59,240
Main might be a place to
get your crew started.

467
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:02,570
It's probably one of the least
populated states in the union. Yeah,

468
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,470
it's way it's way out there, you know, for
us to New Brunswick is pretty, you know,

469
00:28:06,471 --> 00:28:08,060
you're well east at that point.

470
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:12,840
But what's odd is Montreal is north.
Yes.

471
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:17,790
Main yet completely
cosmopolitan. Yeah. Very,

472
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:22,360
very modern in every respect.
The people are fantastic and edgy.

473
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,490
Been up there for you, I guess for
MMA events and comedy events as well.

474
00:28:26,491 --> 00:28:27,660
Both for both.
Oh,

475
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:32,670
I'm going to Montreal since the early
nineties probably since 1990 itself.

476
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,200
Cause when I first started going
up there, I love mine. I do too.

477
00:28:37,201 --> 00:28:41,480
We've never had an opportunity to, to
live there. I've lived, oh well you know,

478
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:44,730
well across the country, but of course
there's the Francophone influence there,

479
00:28:44,731 --> 00:28:47,580
which I don't, I don't know. I guess
you going up there as an American,

480
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:51,150
I don't know how much interaction you
have with that necessarily, you know?

481
00:28:51,151 --> 00:28:53,880
Do you really? Yeah, well of
course. Yeah. I mean a lot of,

482
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,030
a lot of great MMA fighters are,
are,

483
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:01,240
are at least a couple of frank
phoned GSP and Patrick Coty and Lazo.

484
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,840
David was Ocj with Wazo
classes. Carmel. There's um,

485
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:06,790
yeah that holds five.
The,

486
00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:11,791
the Tristar Gym from Montreal is one
of the best MMA gyms in the world,

487
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:13,620
which I don't know how to happen,
you know,

488
00:29:13,621 --> 00:29:17,760
cause MMA like I used to live in Calgary
and that's actually another odd MMA

489
00:29:17,761 --> 00:29:19,980
hotbed. There's, there's a
lot, there's a lot of interest.

490
00:29:19,981 --> 00:29:22,800
I don't know if there's a lot of great
fighters yet who have come out of Calgary,

491
00:29:22,801 --> 00:29:25,050
but there's a quite a few are there now.
Good fighters.

492
00:29:25,051 --> 00:29:28,770
Very good fighters coming up and yeah,
and I did a magazine article on,

493
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,480
on one guy who, um, uh, you know, who won.

494
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,320
I just followed him to his first
professional fight actually,

495
00:29:34,321 --> 00:29:36,360
which was an interesting
sort of thing to follow any,

496
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:39,690
actually he hurt himself really
badly in that fight and that was it.

497
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,860
That was his career.
Um,

498
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,910
but, but I know the gym that he was
working out of had, it was a real,

499
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:49,360
I mean it was, I've, I've rarely been
and felt that level of like comradery,

500
00:29:49,361 --> 00:29:54,340
but also competition. I'm sort
of in such a tight, small area,

501
00:29:54,341 --> 00:29:58,980
so, so, um, that's what you build
great fighters that pressure.

502
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:03,850
Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. I don't know
what it is about Canada and producing, uh,

503
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:07,030
mixed martial arts fighters,
but also mixed martial arts fans.

504
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,890
There's more MMA fans per capita in Canada
than anywhere. Yeah. You bloat the, uh,

505
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:15,860
the Toronto, what is it? The Air Canada
Center. We sell that place out, I think,

506
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:19,990
and they sold out the Roger Center
at the Roger Center. Gigantic,

507
00:30:19,991 --> 00:30:24,170
huge place that used to be. He used to
have a different name. Right. What was it?

508
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:29,160
Skydome skydome. Yeah, exactly. So
that's, and that's amazing. 60,000,

509
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:34,180
60,000 to why it was GSP fight I
think versus just Jake shields.

510
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:36,280
Oh, that's right. That's
right. Yeah, we are,

511
00:30:36,281 --> 00:30:39,280
we're a great sporting supporting nation.
You know,

512
00:30:39,281 --> 00:30:41,980
we just had the raptors just
got bounced out of the playoffs,

513
00:30:41,981 --> 00:30:44,770
like the basketball team and uh,
you know,

514
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,430
selling out and then they had like people
like 20,000 fans clustered outside of

515
00:30:48,431 --> 00:30:52,300
the arena watching. So that's amazing.
Yeah, it is. It's a great, it's,

516
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:55,720
and it's great that you guys in
the UFC come up and I think the,

517
00:30:55,721 --> 00:30:57,070
I think for a while there,

518
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:00,130
it was mostly you guys were down in
Las Vegas and a few other places,

519
00:31:00,131 --> 00:31:02,860
but then you decided to
come up to Canada and it's,

520
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,900
but it's been good for you guys.
Been great for us too.

521
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:09,820
We'll Canada of just has a love of all
things manly. Yes, we do have that,

522
00:31:09,821 --> 00:31:12,360
I think. Yeah. They're
not tracking by it. No.

523
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:17,400
Whereas there's a lot of embarrassment
in America. Things manly.

524
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:22,300
Yeah. Push it away or like, oh,
that's a little too testosterone.

525
00:31:22,301 --> 00:31:26,050
He kind of a thing. Yeah. I have a
friend who was talking about, um, a,

526
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:29,700
a sitcom that he was working on
and he was, uh, talking about, um,

527
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:34,100
there's a woman that was, uh, one
of the leads that was trying to, uh,

528
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,540
introduce you is also one of the writers
and she was trying to introduce these

529
00:31:37,541 --> 00:31:38,650
male characters.

530
00:31:38,651 --> 00:31:42,160
There were like the type of guys that
she likes and they were like, oh,

531
00:31:42,161 --> 00:31:46,180
he's two to two jockeys.
Too much of a meathead.

532
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:51,270
Like they didn't want anybody who was
interested in other women other than the

533
00:31:51,551 --> 00:31:53,380
girl that they're with.
They didn't want that dilemma.

534
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:57,730
They didn't want anyone who was dominant
over the woman in the relationship.

535
00:31:57,731 --> 00:32:00,400
They didn't want anybody who
was obsessed with her body.

536
00:32:00,401 --> 00:32:01,270
You're working out were like,

537
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:05,230
those are like all of our boat and we just
can't go. You can't have those things.

538
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:09,430
And it was the writers themselves
because they felt threatened by that,

539
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:12,880
those types of men.
So they were rejecting those characters.

540
00:32:12,881 --> 00:32:16,140
Girls don't like that. Those
guys, there's a Turkey, you know,

541
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:18,910
guys who wear scarves and stuff.
She was getting angry. She was like,

542
00:32:18,911 --> 00:32:21,360
what do you see these, this
is what I like. Like yeah,

543
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:25,120
me because the type of guys I like,
women don't like these guys. Like what?

544
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:27,900
And whether you like him or not,
that's, that's kind of like a,

545
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:32,590
that's an element of our society to like
why purposely sort of ignore them and

546
00:32:32,591 --> 00:32:35,620
oh no, that wouldn't screen test whether
we don't, we don't want say embarrassing.

547
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:40,150
Well I think I was thinking too
about before coming here, like you,

548
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,990
your career has sort of had,

549
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:45,800
I think you must have run up against
that a lot because like I remember when

550
00:32:45,801 --> 00:32:48,350
fear factor came out, there
was a sense, you know,

551
00:32:48,351 --> 00:32:52,940
there were these hyperbolic newspaper
articles like, ah, society is collapsing.

552
00:32:52,941 --> 00:32:55,220
You know, it's fear factor. Like
we're, you know what I mean?

553
00:32:55,221 --> 00:32:57,020
People are doing things that like,

554
00:32:57,021 --> 00:33:00,740
why are we getting people to eat bugs or
stuff? And I thought, I love that show.

555
00:33:00,741 --> 00:33:01,221
You know what I mean?

556
00:33:01,221 --> 00:33:04,700
And then the UFC comes along and
it's the same kind of like Ha,

557
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:08,150
what was one of your politicians had the,
the human cockfight.

558
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,090
A bunch of them use that,
right? Yeah. And so you've been,

559
00:33:11,091 --> 00:33:14,990
you've been situated a along that
that line I think and so you'd be,

560
00:33:14,991 --> 00:33:18,320
I'd be sensitized to it if I were you. At
this point it's like, come on, screw off.

561
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,303
Well,
if I was

562
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:21,750
doing things from a public
relations standpoint,

563
00:33:21,751 --> 00:33:25,100
I've been nothing but poor choices.
Right. You looked at it that way. Yeah.

564
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:29,070
When I was first starting to work for
the UFC was in 1997 and the people that

565
00:33:29,071 --> 00:33:31,740
was, I wasn't on sitcoms on Newsradio
the sitcoms. That's right. Yeah.

566
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:34,290
People were talking to me like I
was doing porn. Like they're like,

567
00:33:34,291 --> 00:33:35,970
what the fuck are you doing?
Like that.

568
00:33:35,971 --> 00:33:39,480
Like they thought it ruin your career
really. You're involved in cage fighting.

569
00:33:39,481 --> 00:33:42,030
Like what's wrong? I was like, it's just,

570
00:33:42,031 --> 00:33:44,880
it's martial arts they take
that takes place in a cage.

571
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:47,880
It could take place in a high school
gymnasium. Would that be okay with you?

572
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:51,760
Would that make it more sanitized for you
as in a field? Would that be all right,

573
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:56,190
frank? What difference does it make where
it takes place in martial arts, but the,

574
00:33:56,191 --> 00:33:58,530
um, the rejection of things manly. I mean,

575
00:33:58,531 --> 00:34:02,190
it has its roots in some pretty
disgusting behavior. You know,

576
00:34:02,191 --> 00:34:07,191
when you see like the Steubenville rape
case and sure the jocks conspired as

577
00:34:07,831 --> 00:34:12,030
long, uh, along with people that worked
at the school to high sort of, yeah,

578
00:34:12,031 --> 00:34:15,330
cover that shit up,
that kind of, you know,

579
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:20,370
misogynistic, supported
thinking. The group think of,

580
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:24,180
you know, fuck these bitches, you
know? Yeah. All the men together.

581
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:28,110
But those are just weak humans.
Those are pathetic humans.

582
00:34:28,111 --> 00:34:32,340
It has nothing to do with masculinity.
Yeah, no, I completely agree.

583
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:33,091
But that's the thing.

584
00:34:33,091 --> 00:34:38,091
It was like masculinity gets tied into
all the reprehensible aspects of male

585
00:34:38,221 --> 00:34:42,750
behavior against women, not just a
celebration of things that men love.

586
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,980
Men love certain things that
don't harm other people.

587
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:51,390
Like men love cars that are
loud and fast. Yes. You know,

588
00:34:51,391 --> 00:34:54,260
men love a lot of thing.
Men love shooting guns.

589
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:56,010
Doesn't mean they want to kill people.
No.

590
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:59,040
It's like there's something
fun about shooting a gun.

591
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:03,990
And if you bring that up and you say that,
oh, I don't have gun, I don't own guns,

592
00:35:03,991 --> 00:35:07,240
that's not leaving. They need to
take away all the guns. I mean,

593
00:35:07,241 --> 00:35:09,720
I've had these conversations with people
whenever there's a school shooting,

594
00:35:09,721 --> 00:35:10,890
they need to take away all the guns.

595
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:15,240
Maybe they need to stop giving people
these fucking drugs that make them

596
00:35:15,241 --> 00:35:17,820
psychotic. You ever think about
the dragon, the over it? Yeah.

597
00:35:17,821 --> 00:35:20,610
That's sort of the over
medication of some of these kids.

598
00:35:20,611 --> 00:35:23,070
And 90% of all school shooters,

599
00:35:23,071 --> 00:35:28,071
90 plus are either on Ssri or
eyes or are recovering from ssrs.

600
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,240
They're in withdrawal
from antidepressants.

601
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:33,390
And it doesn't necessarily mean that
the antidepressants caused that.

602
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:36,780
But I do believe there's,
without a doubt and over prescription of,

603
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,720
without a doubt,
he go to a doctor.

604
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:43,710
The doctor's not going to
look at a holistic approach
to your life and say, hey,

605
00:35:43,711 --> 00:35:46,590
you know, maybe you were raised
by shitty human beings. Yeah.

606
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,990
Maybe you need counseling for a decade

607
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:51,480
Beta blocker and that'll
all the bad thoughts

608
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:54,390
walled off. Yeah. And we'll not only that,

609
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,310
all your inhibitions are going to be less,

610
00:35:56,311 --> 00:36:00,660
and your ability to understand the
consequences of your actions will be less

611
00:36:00,661 --> 00:36:05,661
into your ability to be depressed and
to feel terrible about bad actions has

612
00:36:06,781 --> 00:36:07,740
also been removed.

613
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:11,490
There's a lot of things that happen
when you put people on drugs that change

614
00:36:11,491 --> 00:36:14,400
your neurochemistry. It doesn't mean
that those drugs are bad. You know,

615
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:18,630
I get these fucking tweets from these
people that can understand a complex

616
00:36:18,631 --> 00:36:20,400
argument or a nuanced conversation.

617
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:24,760
I have friends personally
that have benefited greatly
from antidepressants. Yeah,

618
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:29,010
and I don't I, it's not that I
deny them or don't support them.

619
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,660
I think there's definitely
a place for them,

620
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:35,520
but I think when you look at all these
people that have killed mass groups of

621
00:36:35,521 --> 00:36:39,810
people and you find this
one common denominator over
and over and over again to

622
00:36:39,811 --> 00:36:43,920
ignore that, but concentrate entirely
on the tool itself is ridiculous.

623
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,300
Most human beings are absolutely incapable
of walking into a school and shooting

624
00:36:48,301 --> 00:36:50,460
a bunch of children.
Most human beings.

625
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:54,660
What is it about some human beings
that are capable? I don't know,

626
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:58,650
but that's not being discussed.
Gun Control's being discussed,

627
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,560
the raising of children's
not being discussed,

628
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:05,910
it's gun control that's being discussed.
I find that ridiculous. I really do.

629
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:11,240
And I think that that it sort of
gets lumped in with this rejection of

630
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:15,210
manliness, this, you know, this, uh,

631
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:20,240
support of anything that's anti male or
this denial of these base male instincts

632
00:37:22,831 --> 00:37:26,730
yeah. Don't necessarily have to be
harmful to other people like competition.

633
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:31,380
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's
so much about it. I mean, I'm,
my career is in a way, uh,

634
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:35,120
you know, again, my early stuff was
all about my boat men doing men things,

635
00:37:35,121 --> 00:37:38,480
which some of it is, is
silly and self harming, but,

636
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:42,290
but also it's like something that I
think built into our genome we need to

637
00:37:42,291 --> 00:37:45,290
express in, in a certain way.
You know what I mean? So,

638
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,980
but I know that a certain segment of,

639
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,170
of readers or who just were like,

640
00:37:51,171 --> 00:37:54,100
they were turned off and immediately in
the same way that and the same way that

641
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,760
these TV writers were just like,
no,

642
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:59,140
but that's just the wrong people for
your stuff. That's all new defined.

643
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,910
You know what you need to find a
receptive audience. And the same,

644
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:05,940
I think your career has been a lot of
that is about finding the right. Uh, and,

645
00:38:05,941 --> 00:38:08,570
and also I think also for both of us,

646
00:38:08,571 --> 00:38:12,080
it's about making people realize
that like, I'm not a meathead,

647
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:14,560
you're not a meathead. Do you know
what I mean? There's, but the,

648
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:16,250
I feel like people think that like I'm,

649
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,890
they read this book and
they assume that I'm,

650
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,940
I am a meathead or am I wrote a book
called the fighter's. Yeah. Yeah.

651
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:26,210
And so your boxing match, right,
right. And would be the same. Same,

652
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,100
I don't mean to put words in your mouth,

653
00:38:28,101 --> 00:38:30,740
but I don't know if you've had the same
experiences yourself and it's sort of

654
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:34,700
like, um, you know, I wasn't
raised that way. I don't,

655
00:38:34,701 --> 00:38:36,450
I don't myself a typical

656
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:40,360
and whatever. If you're a jock, that's
fine. You know what I mean? Not, you know,

657
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,950
you're a Steubenville Ville type,
you know,

658
00:38:41,951 --> 00:38:44,690
if you have that kind of job mentality,
it's not the,

659
00:38:44,691 --> 00:38:47,890
I wouldn't say that it's like a, what
would you call that? I'd say it Bro,

660
00:38:47,891 --> 00:38:50,770
but I don't think so. I think
grows are more lights, rapist.

661
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,060
It's straight up a rapist.

662
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:56,350
He's a shit human being and most likely
you have a bad relationship with your

663
00:38:56,351 --> 00:39:01,351
mother or your sisters or someone in your
family who just did a terrible job of

664
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:06,960
expressing to you the responsibility of
being the physically stronger sex and

665
00:39:07,301 --> 00:39:12,010
the the one that is the penetrator,
not the penetrate. Yeah. You know,

666
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,960
this whole relationship
between men and women.

667
00:39:13,961 --> 00:39:16,330
I think a huge part of
it is how they're raised,

668
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:19,330
how human beings are raised and what
kind of relationship where they have with

669
00:39:19,331 --> 00:39:21,970
their family. I had a really
good relationship with my mother.

670
00:39:21,971 --> 00:39:26,620
I'm really lucky in that respect. Like
I've never had any hate towards women,

671
00:39:26,621 --> 00:39:30,980
but I have friends that genuinely
don't, women like women, I mean,

672
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:34,180
and that came from their, from their
upbringing. Either because their father,

673
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:37,600
maybe they had to divorce or something
is bad. It's like she's awful bad.

674
00:39:37,601 --> 00:39:41,770
Moms are bad moms started out bad mom's
bad relationships with women and they

675
00:39:41,771 --> 00:39:44,470
just, they just don't like
women. I mean, I don't do,

676
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,940
I don't have good friends
that are like that,

677
00:39:45,941 --> 00:39:49,300
but I know people that will say
fucking cons. They're all the same.

678
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,880
They'll say shit like that around
you and you're like, come on,

679
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:54,730
you're missing out.
This is a lot of great chicks out there.

680
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:57,630
Just like there's a lot of dudes
that I would, I would, if I,

681
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:00,310
there's some people that if I
was alone with them in the woods,

682
00:40:00,311 --> 00:40:03,820
I would seriously think about killing
them right away with it. Yeah. Yeah.

683
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:08,530
If you are ready. Yeah. If you
around, here's the perfect example.

684
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:12,490
If you are around that
fucking not Joe Paterno,

685
00:40:12,491 --> 00:40:16,330
who was the other guy that got
raped? Oh, Sandusky. I wasn't around.

686
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:19,480
If I was in the woods and it was just
me and sent dusk and there's sort of a

687
00:40:19,481 --> 00:40:19,871
grave,

688
00:40:19,871 --> 00:40:23,170
maybe just sit and there's no one around
and I looked to the left and there's

689
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:27,490
just miles and miles of woods.
Fuck you. I kill that guy.

690
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:28,760
Yeah.
Yeah.

691
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:33,070
If I knew he raped kids 100% I'd
kill him if I could get away with it.

692
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:38,400
Why? Because I don't believe that
all lives are created equal. I don't,

693
00:40:38,401 --> 00:40:42,640
I think that there's, there's a yin and a
Yang to the world. There's good and bad.

694
00:40:42,641 --> 00:40:47,290
There's positive and negative. There's
give and take and you got to trim weeds,

695
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:50,050
right? You gotta, you gotta shoot
dogs that have rabies. You know,

696
00:40:50,051 --> 00:40:54,130
there's a lot of things that happen in
this world that are uncomfortable that

697
00:40:54,131 --> 00:40:57,640
people don't like. Their unfortunate
but that they need to be done.

698
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,400
And when you find some guy
likes to rape children,

699
00:41:00,401 --> 00:41:03,580
you should remove him from the
earth. Yeah, yeah. This is a mess.

700
00:41:03,581 --> 00:41:05,170
You can't clean this up.
No,

701
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:08,440
and I feel like it's high to know that
I'm probably getting out of my depth here

702
00:41:08,441 --> 00:41:13,270
in terms of what my real understanding
of it, but I feel like it's such a built,

703
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:15,880
like it's something deep in
your Dna Helix and your genome.

704
00:41:15,881 --> 00:41:17,680
Like you're not going to route it out.
You know what I mean?

705
00:41:17,681 --> 00:41:21,340
The best you can do is hope that you
don't or aren't in a situation or you're,

706
00:41:21,341 --> 00:41:26,000
you're, you're somehow away from
the source of what you're, you're,

707
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:30,490
you know, issue is basically, but I
mean, if you're out in society, I mean,

708
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,640
of course you're going
to be sort of up against,

709
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:35,930
and I don't think you get
cured from something like
that. I mean, I don't, I again,

710
00:41:35,931 --> 00:41:38,080
I don't know for sure, but
I feel like, yeah, yeah. I,

711
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:42,470
well I think there may be a time in the
future where we can understand and get

712
00:41:42,471 --> 00:41:46,820
to the root of these behaviors
and perhaps access whatever it is,

713
00:41:46,821 --> 00:41:51,821
is wrong in a person's mind that makes
them either have a desire to victimize

714
00:41:52,461 --> 00:41:57,410
children or have the ability to victimize
children and not feel remorse for it

715
00:41:57,411 --> 00:42:02,060
or be attracted to it.
Do you as a writer, um,

716
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,400
do you,
cause I was a comic.

717
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:09,680
I watch a lot of things that I don't agree
with and I will be no other comedians

718
00:42:09,681 --> 00:42:11,570
doing things or just,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

719
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:15,800
Like a watch religious
programs. Okay. Yeah.

720
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:20,860
I watch a conservative right
wing propaganda shows and
just be seeding and every

721
00:42:21,951 --> 00:42:24,570
muscle tense when you're
watching it sometimes, oh no,

722
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:29,610
just try to get empty when I do those
things because I don't want to get angry.

723
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:30,420
Um,
I,

724
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:34,470
what I want to do is try to find the
patterns in their thinking and trying and

725
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:36,680
you see a lot of commonality in,

726
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:41,720
in these sort of group think mindset's
whether it's Republicans or I see it in

727
00:42:42,411 --> 00:42:47,240
feminists a lot. I see it in
male feminists, I see it in, um,

728
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,640
there's people like they,

729
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:53,540
they choose sides and then
there's a massive amount of
confirmation bias and you

730
00:42:53,541 --> 00:42:57,290
see it, you know, you see it
both ways. But as a writer,

731
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:02,680
do you like to study like certain
mindsets or certain people that are just

732
00:43:03,021 --> 00:43:08,021
completely alien to your way of thinking
to try to grab pieces of the way they

733
00:43:08,451 --> 00:43:11,910
interact to jump into their head and
said you could trace a narrative thread

734
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:17,090
through their eyes? I have tried that,
I think. I think that's, you know,

735
00:43:17,091 --> 00:43:21,920
I know writers and I certainly
know Comedians who, I mean
it's sort of like the,

736
00:43:21,921 --> 00:43:24,470
the, the, the rage based comedian.

737
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:27,410
Like you really want to sort of
confront these things, you know,

738
00:43:27,411 --> 00:43:31,550
and like really go on a good harangue.
I'm it. And I think, I think, uh,

739
00:43:31,551 --> 00:43:34,520
really it's sometimes not even
funny with a, with a comedian,

740
00:43:34,521 --> 00:43:37,490
but it's really true and it's
really like honest and it's really,

741
00:43:37,491 --> 00:43:40,410
you're actually getting more of a social
commentary at that point. Like Hicks.

742
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:45,080
Yeah, exactly. Like you're
getting a really strong
distilled, powerful medicine,

743
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:49,090
you know. Um, and there's some writers
who sort of work in the satirists domain,

744
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:53,180
I guess, who started do the same thing,
you know, over the length of a book. Um,

745
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:58,310
so I've tried that.
I've never found as much success with it,

746
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:03,110
at least not yet, you know? Um,
cause the same thing. Of course I uh,

747
00:44:03,111 --> 00:44:06,530
we have a strong conservative,
you know, base, you know,

748
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,200
conservative radio always gets,
gets on my nerves.

749
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:13,250
It's funny cause we have Right now we
have rob Ford are our mayor and Toronto

750
00:44:13,251 --> 00:44:17,870
who's doing all sorts of hilarious
because he is in Rehab now. Uh, you know,

751
00:44:17,871 --> 00:44:19,910
and he's like, he's no
end of fun. You know,

752
00:44:19,911 --> 00:44:23,240
I was sitting at the bar yesterday when
I got in and I was talking to somebody,

753
00:44:23,241 --> 00:44:26,360
he's act at a defense contractor
actually. And he was like, he, you know,

754
00:44:26,361 --> 00:44:27,980
he sounds like he seems
like a pretty good guy.

755
00:44:27,981 --> 00:44:29,960
At least he's straight out
honest. I'm like, he is a,

756
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:32,040
he was a guy you could probably go
out and feel like you'd have a beer

757
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,380
with and I don't think he looked
down at you for sure. But, um,

758
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:38,040
he's also the mayor of our city and he's,
he's,

759
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:41,430
I mean he's a bit of a goof and he's
a bit of a bully I find as well.

760
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:45,420
But it's funny to listen
to the conservative pundits
cause they've got to turn

761
00:44:45,421 --> 00:44:49,350
themselves into paroxysms and back
twist to try and defend his behavior

762
00:44:49,351 --> 00:44:49,891
basically.

763
00:44:49,891 --> 00:44:53,760
And it gets more and more difficult to
kind of defend the behavior of a man who

764
00:44:53,761 --> 00:44:54,690
keeps doing more.

765
00:44:54,691 --> 00:44:59,130
And more interesting kind of
a WHO's trying to defend him.

766
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:02,550
Wow. Really? Once you've planted
your well, conservatives,

767
00:45:02,551 --> 00:45:05,970
I feel like I am more liberal,
so quite liberal. Uh, so once,

768
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,530
I think once a conservative or liberal,

769
00:45:07,531 --> 00:45:10,350
but once you plant your stick in the dirt,
you just gotta keep,

770
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:13,680
you gotta keep holding onto that stick
even though the wind is blowing you like

771
00:45:13,681 --> 00:45:18,240
straight back. Yeah. And one of the, one
of them was like, well, I mean, you know,

772
00:45:18,241 --> 00:45:20,580
he's getting,
he's getting videotaped all the time by,

773
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:22,290
you think he'd be hanging around,
you know,

774
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,170
I can't believe his
friends are videotaping.

775
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:25,980
It's like he's hanging
around with drug dealers.

776
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:30,810
You can't really expect a drug dealer
not to do something that may or may not

777
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:34,410
profit them in some way. So anyways,
but you know, and of course,

778
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,200
you know the one talking head says that
another one. Yeah, that's, that's true.

779
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:38,220
I never looked at it that way.

780
00:45:38,221 --> 00:45:41,280
So then suddenly that becomes an arguable
point that they can be like, yeah,

781
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,500
he's getting victimized again.

782
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:47,780
That was the argument about Donald
Sterling. Oh God. Y'All know his clippers.

783
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:50,240
Yellow's the argument like,
Hey,

784
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:54,080
the guy's getting illegally wire tapped.
You know,

785
00:45:54,081 --> 00:45:55,370
we'll give him a give him a up.

786
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:59,370
Yes, that's right. He didn't know. He's
just an old doddering old man, which yeah,

787
00:45:59,371 --> 00:46:00,540
true enough.
I feel,

788
00:46:00,541 --> 00:46:03,730
I heard some argument that he was actually
asking her to tape him because yes,

789
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:06,720
he felt like his head was going to
tapioca and he couldn't remember anything

790
00:46:06,721 --> 00:46:08,160
anymore. So he's like, please take me.

791
00:46:08,161 --> 00:46:11,430
So that I remember all the things that
I say apparently that's the truth. Yeah.

792
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:14,760
That was actually part of her job
wire tapped himself basically.

793
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:15,261
Yeah.

794
00:46:15,261 --> 00:46:20,150
And her job was to tape their conversation
so that he would remember what they

795
00:46:20,151 --> 00:46:20,984
talked about.

796
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:23,630
So like there were certain issues that
he had to clear up and certain things

797
00:46:23,631 --> 00:46:24,440
that he had to do.

798
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:29,290
She was apparently employed by him
in some sort of a Pr Sassy. Yeah.

799
00:46:29,291 --> 00:46:30,124
Yeah.

800
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:34,850
So it's funny because even discussing it
like w d like what does this guy have a

801
00:46:34,851 --> 00:46:37,850
right to privacy? People were like, I
can't believe you're supporting him.

802
00:46:37,851 --> 00:46:41,990
Like there's so many fucking morons out
there that have the ability to comment

803
00:46:41,991 --> 00:46:43,490
on anything that gets discussed.

804
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:48,500
Like you can't think of the guy's
thinking is reprehensible, but yet think,

805
00:46:48,501 --> 00:46:49,850
hey, why is this? Is it,

806
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:54,140
why is it okay to just listened
to a private conversation
that this guy's having

807
00:46:54,141 --> 00:46:57,920
because somebody recorded it and then
find him for that private conversation.

808
00:46:57,950 --> 00:46:59,780
I don't think it is.
I don't think it's,

809
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:03,340
you're right. I mean, I'm, I,
these are one of, you know,

810
00:47:03,341 --> 00:47:06,460
you've heard this a lot of times and of
course you have to separate what he said

811
00:47:06,461 --> 00:47:08,830
and the reprehensible,
clearly the longstanding,

812
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:11,290
reprehensible nature of this
man has, he's, you know,

813
00:47:11,291 --> 00:47:15,340
sort of proven to be over like 20 year
span. And then of course the question is,

814
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:16,780
and it's been asked already,
why,

815
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:19,840
why is he still in that position
where everyone knows he was, uh,

816
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:24,070
a racist dirt bag, but no one was,
you know, doing anything about it.

817
00:47:24,071 --> 00:47:26,770
And I think at this point they got, the
players basically pushed it. They said,

818
00:47:26,771 --> 00:47:29,980
listen, if you don't get rid
of this guy, we not come out

819
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,530
and play anymore.
And apparently it got to that point,

820
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:37,450
he also represents a very unsavory aspect
of our culture. Yeah, that's right.

821
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:41,530
So it's important to take a stand
and say, hey, this guy's got to go.

822
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:42,760
What I didn't get,

823
00:47:42,761 --> 00:47:47,170
the thing that puzzled me the most is
that they find them two point $5 billion

824
00:47:47,171 --> 00:47:48,880
for a conversation that
he had in his house.

825
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:53,200
Like I don't see that standing
up in court. And he is,

826
00:47:53,201 --> 00:47:56,080
he's a litigious dude,
so he's going to sue the fuck out of that.

827
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:58,180
They're going to lose so much money.

828
00:47:58,181 --> 00:48:01,540
They're going to lose millions of dollars
because they tried to find him two

829
00:48:01,541 --> 00:48:05,890
point $5 million to make a point. They're
going to lose so much money. And I had,

830
00:48:05,891 --> 00:48:07,420
I wondered a conversation too,
you know,

831
00:48:07,421 --> 00:48:10,000
because now the value of that team
is up in the air. Like what does it,

832
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:11,440
what does it work? You know? And I think,

833
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:15,640
I think it's going to be
worth more because once they,
if they make them sell it,

834
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:19,270
you know what I mean? Because then it's
almost like Tabula Rasa, we can redo it.

835
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:22,810
It's like we're getting rid of this
old troglodyte and you know, who knows.

836
00:48:22,811 --> 00:48:26,230
It might be like black ownership who
comes in? Magic Johnson, Magic Johnson.

837
00:48:26,231 --> 00:48:30,730
I think Oprah Winfrey was
sort of in chosen. She was,
that was all just nonsense.

838
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:33,460
Okay. Um, but yeah, magic
Johnson would be the,

839
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:37,540
cause he was one of the ones who was
actually insulted deeply. Plus he has HIV.

840
00:48:37,541 --> 00:48:42,250
It's even better. Right? He's got
everything's good. He loves Jesus.

841
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:46,750
Get them in there and x Laker. Yeah, he's
perfect. He's great basketball player.

842
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:51,670
And he was one of the ones that I think
she was a in trouble for taking photos

843
00:48:51,671 --> 00:48:55,240
with. That's right. That's, and that's
what sterling brought it up. He was like,

844
00:48:55,241 --> 00:48:58,840
do we really have to have you
taking pictures with Magic Johnson?

845
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:03,940
Dumb. But it's an interesting, you
know, it's, it is, it is an end.

846
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:05,890
It's amazing how quick it blew up to me.

847
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:08,110
Like I just saw it on some
website and I thought, well,

848
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:11,440
there's just an old dumb white guy
saying old dumb white guy things.

849
00:49:11,441 --> 00:49:13,690
But it was much more clearly,
much bigger than that.

850
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:17,960
Well if it was something else,
like say if he was safe,

851
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:21,160
he was a president of a company,
a big company,

852
00:49:21,161 --> 00:49:22,570
General Electric or something like that.

853
00:49:22,571 --> 00:49:25,510
And he had a little piece on
the side and he was like, Hey,

854
00:49:25,511 --> 00:49:27,130
stop taking pictures of black eyes.

855
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:32,470
It wouldn't get nearly the response as
someone who has benefited tremendously

856
00:49:32,471 --> 00:49:34,360
from black athletes. Right. That's right.

857
00:49:34,361 --> 00:49:38,650
The amount of money that that guy has
made because directly because of the work

858
00:49:38,651 --> 00:49:39,640
of black athletes,

859
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:44,950
it's got that whole slave owner type
quality to it. You know? And there were,

860
00:49:44,951 --> 00:49:47,410
there were rumors that, you know,
back in a couple of years ago,

861
00:49:47,411 --> 00:49:50,350
he'd gone into the dressing
room and all the, you know,

862
00:49:50,351 --> 00:49:52,960
basketball players had been in various
stages of undress. And he's like,

863
00:49:52,961 --> 00:49:56,680
I like seeing all this, you know, black,
black flesh, you know what I mean?

864
00:49:56,681 --> 00:49:59,460
Sort of a thing. So he said to
a woman, he brought a woman, oh,

865
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:01,630
is that how a locker room?
And he was saying,

866
00:50:01,631 --> 00:50:05,190
look at all these beautiful black box.
Right. That's the exact quote. Yeah, yeah.

867
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:06,401
Who knows?
Yeah.

868
00:50:06,401 --> 00:50:09,070
I think things like that are going to
spiral and all sorts of direction and you

869
00:50:09,071 --> 00:50:11,900
can, you can quote things that may,
he may or may not actually say,

870
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:13,130
but I mean the guy does,
you know,

871
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:16,630
at a certain point it's like you've
opened Pandora's box, my friend.

872
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:21,520
Well he didn't even mean to
no so dumb and old, right?

873
00:50:21,521 --> 00:50:25,390
Can't remember shit. No. So Pandora's
box sorta opened the belt on its own.

874
00:50:25,391 --> 00:50:28,010
That's right.
Do you think though that as a writer

875
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:32,300
for like studying a guys like that,
do you actively do that?

876
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:37,330
Do you actively like watch how a guy
thinks he sort of absorb his stupid

877
00:50:37,551 --> 00:50:41,540
thinking? I certainly find, I've
done it more in magazine articles.

878
00:50:41,541 --> 00:50:45,320
I've wrote like profiles, you know, of of
people. But I've used that to move into,

879
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:49,610
into my fictional work too. So like, um,
you like if it was a basketball player,

880
00:50:49,611 --> 00:50:52,860
say that you were falling around,
you would try to climb into their mind,

881
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:56,900
shadow them. Really like you physically
shadow them and what does your day, can I,

882
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:57,741
can I follow you?

883
00:50:57,741 --> 00:51:00,680
And of course that's up to the level
of how much they're willing to have you

884
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:03,680
basically dug their heels
for as long as they're there.

885
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:05,120
But I mean the more you can do that,

886
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:08,390
the better it's the better the actual
article is going to be depending on if

887
00:51:08,391 --> 00:51:09,920
they want that or not. But like the, um,

888
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:13,970
the MMA fighter I followed obviously
he was just an amateur guys.

889
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:16,370
His name was Ryan styles. Uh, and,

890
00:51:16,371 --> 00:51:18,710
and he actually only had one
fight and was up in red deer.

891
00:51:18,711 --> 00:51:21,320
So like Calgary and then red here's
about two or three hours away.

892
00:51:21,321 --> 00:51:26,060
And it was like in a, a civic center sort
of a thing. And uh, but he was really,

893
00:51:26,061 --> 00:51:28,160
his father is great story,
man.

894
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:31,280
I find the best stories sometimes
are where you don't quite make it,

895
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,080
you know what I mean?
Like athletically,

896
00:51:33,081 --> 00:51:36,320
it's like you put your heart and your
guts and your soul into it and you're just

897
00:51:36,321 --> 00:51:39,980
not quite good enough. Right. You know
what I mean? There's something about you,

898
00:51:39,981 --> 00:51:42,020
you just can't quite get over the hump.
You know,

899
00:51:42,021 --> 00:51:45,650
I think I find those are the stories
that are the most hit my heart,

900
00:51:45,651 --> 00:51:49,850
the strongest, you know, and his
father is on the Calgary Swat team now,

901
00:51:49,851 --> 00:51:52,550
but he was, uh, had pat
played forever in the,

902
00:51:52,551 --> 00:51:56,390
in the junior league of hockey and he
made it up for a cup of coffee with the

903
00:51:56,391 --> 00:51:57,530
leafs for like two games,

904
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:02,240
but he played professional hockey for
two games and his son was like an an

905
00:52:02,241 --> 00:52:04,280
incredible wrestler,
sort of had, you know,

906
00:52:04,281 --> 00:52:09,020
had the classic sort of MMA
pedigree and uh, but he drove a, uh,

907
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:10,850
like a sandwich truck.
Do you know those things?

908
00:52:10,851 --> 00:52:14,000
They go around to work sites and you
know, a, I like a catering truck.

909
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:18,860
And so I followed him for like three or
four days on that job and he actually

910
00:52:18,861 --> 00:52:21,650
said that he let people take
things on credit, you know,

911
00:52:21,651 --> 00:52:23,240
and so people would
build up like a hundred,

912
00:52:23,241 --> 00:52:26,420
couple hundred bucks before they
paid it off. Finally. And one guy,

913
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:30,620
I guess like just, you know, we went
to a Kim mechanic shop and he was like,

914
00:52:30,621 --> 00:52:33,080
it's so and so here. It needs to settle
as bill. He's like, no, he went up,

915
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:36,860
he's like a wildcat are now up in
Fort Mcmurray, like 10 hours away.

916
00:52:36,861 --> 00:52:40,330
He just bailed. He just left in the
middle of the night. So Tony, you know,

917
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:43,550
who has a, has a, had a wife
and a young kid got in the car,

918
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:48,020
I went up and found them and uh, and, and
got his money back, you know, so I mean,

919
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:51,170
this is the sort of mentality
that this guy had. So,

920
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:55,340
so when I think I got a pretty strong
story out of that just by being able to

921
00:52:55,370 --> 00:52:58,580
stay with them long enough, he was
really nice to speak to me, talked to me,

922
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,040
and you got in borrowed
inside of his head. Um,

923
00:53:01,041 --> 00:53:04,420
and I think the strongest work
comes from as close as you can,

924
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:06,440
can get to those people, you know? Yeah.

925
00:53:06,441 --> 00:53:10,070
Isn't it fascinating
that we have this deep,

926
00:53:10,071 --> 00:53:14,600
deep connection to towards people that
really are never going to realize their

927
00:53:14,601 --> 00:53:18,230
goals. It's a painful, I feel the
same way myself. You know what I mean?

928
00:53:18,231 --> 00:53:22,550
It's like I've always felt
like the mountain goes up
and up and up. You got to,

929
00:53:22,551 --> 00:53:25,740
if you're going to hit your point on
it at some point and you gotta be happy

930
00:53:25,741 --> 00:53:28,050
with that spot where you are
in the mountain, whenever you,

931
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:29,250
whenever you reached that spot.

932
00:53:29,251 --> 00:53:32,340
I think that's the biggest part in life
really is just accepting your spot on

933
00:53:32,341 --> 00:53:33,270
the mountain wherever it happens,

934
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:35,100
be well.
It's also the,

935
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:40,700
the real issue with putting all of your
eggs in one basket and that basket being

936
00:53:41,341 --> 00:53:45,390
athletics and especially athletics,
especially combat athletics,

937
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:51,080
the idea that you're going to have some
sort of a long and successful fruitful

938
00:53:51,151 --> 00:53:55,560
career by throwing your bones and another
person trying to separate themselves

939
00:53:55,561 --> 00:53:56,640
from their consciousness.

940
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:02,000
That's quite ridiculous because just the
very act of doing it in preparing for

941
00:54:02,521 --> 00:54:07,521
that very active to the amount of damage
that your body and your brain even

942
00:54:07,621 --> 00:54:11,970
endures is. But we have this
idea in our heads that, you know,

943
00:54:11,971 --> 00:54:14,600
a guy has to be an undefeated
champion and then, you know,

944
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:18,960
my son's going to be a champion some
day. Like, man, if you're really lucky,

945
00:54:18,961 --> 00:54:21,270
your son won't be a champion.
If you're really lucky,

946
00:54:21,271 --> 00:54:25,440
your son will learn the valuable
lessons of martial arts as far as like

947
00:54:25,441 --> 00:54:26,970
character development and the,

948
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:31,560
as far as your ability to overcome what
seemed to be unsurmountable obstacles.

949
00:54:31,561 --> 00:54:34,890
But to become a champion,
you have to be a crazy person.

950
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:39,000
You have to be crazy person who's obsessed
with nothing but that and that will

951
00:54:39,001 --> 00:54:39,990
take over your life.

952
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:40,890
Yeah.

953
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:45,510
And I feel like having worked Avi
obviously with people like that, you know,

954
00:54:45,511 --> 00:54:50,420
shadowed them and recognizing
that mindset. Um, uh, I,

955
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:51,960
you know,
and I find too,

956
00:54:51,961 --> 00:54:56,460
like there's just some point at which
like there's some gifts that are just

957
00:54:56,461 --> 00:55:00,330
bestowed by genetics or something,
and it doesn't matter how hard you work,

958
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:05,220
you're not going to quite get to that.
Maybe that level that separates the real,

959
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:08,220
and you won't know that until you hit it.
You know what I mean?

960
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:10,590
You're not going to know that
wall until you run into it.

961
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:13,650
And I feel like for some people,
like I was talking to one guy,

962
00:55:13,651 --> 00:55:15,900
just a guy at the gym and,
and uh,

963
00:55:15,901 --> 00:55:18,180
he said something more or
less like the best that he,

964
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:21,360
he ever felt in a fight was when he was
up against someone he knew was better

965
00:55:21,361 --> 00:55:24,960
than him and he knew he was going to lose.
And if they fought a hundred times,

966
00:55:24,961 --> 00:55:28,530
he'd lose a hundred times.
But he tacked guy,

967
00:55:28,531 --> 00:55:30,630
he made that guy see
something about himself.

968
00:55:30,631 --> 00:55:34,590
He got that close to him that the other
guys sort of recognize I'm a frail,

969
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:37,920
I made out of the same crumbling stuff
that he's made out of. And so, you know,

970
00:55:37,921 --> 00:55:40,350
sort of pierce that Teflon armor that,

971
00:55:40,351 --> 00:55:43,050
that I think some fighters carry around
with themselves and he's like, that's,

972
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:46,560
that's all I could do. That for
me is the victory. I still lost.

973
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:47,850
But I made that guide,

974
00:55:47,851 --> 00:55:51,690
discover something about himself that
he hadn't discovered up until that point

975
00:55:51,691 --> 00:55:53,660
because he'd never been tested
to the point that I got to.

976
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:58,110
I wasn't able to test them. And I thought
that's another part about just being,

977
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:02,550
recognizing what you're able to do. You
know, and it may not be beating them,

978
00:56:02,551 --> 00:56:05,550
but it's you,
you find some other measure of success.

979
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:09,660
That's fascinating because to me,
if you say that someone can get so close,

980
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:12,390
they could test someone,
that means that they could beat him.

981
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:16,350
They just have to figure out what it is
they did wrong and going out again and

982
00:56:16,351 --> 00:56:20,370
work harder. That's where the madness
lies. Yeah. Maybe that's it, isn't it?

983
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,130
The madness lies in the preparation.
The madness in the trying

984
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:28,600
to like what separates a champion
from someone who was just very good.

985
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:33,430
Well, from my personal experience
involved in martial arts competition,

986
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:36,190
there's a level that some people are
just not willing to push themselves.

987
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:39,730
Is that it really? Yeah, it's a big
part of it. And then outside of that,

988
00:56:39,731 --> 00:56:43,150
there the other variables or genetics.
Psychology,

989
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:46,570
some people have,
some people have a different psychology.

990
00:56:46,571 --> 00:56:49,460
What's really interesting is
people that have been bullied, um,

991
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:52,060
and especially people that
have larger brothers that,

992
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,920
that bullied them in the
house their whole life.

993
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,220
Those are the scariest
fuckers on the Braille.

994
00:56:56,630 --> 00:57:00,430
It's like GSP I think was
bullied and he was now. But yeah,

995
00:57:00,431 --> 00:57:05,050
he Weidman was bullied. Jon Jones has
a good relationship with his brothers,

996
00:57:05,051 --> 00:57:07,420
but he has a giant brother
who was way bigger than him.

997
00:57:07,421 --> 00:57:08,620
His brother Arthur is a beast.

998
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:12,680
He's a pro football player and he fucks
John up all the time whenever the rest

999
00:57:12,690 --> 00:57:16,750
of today still fuck. Yeah,
he's huge. So because of that,

1000
00:57:16,751 --> 00:57:21,700
I think that John grew up with this
just super athlete brother and he ain't

1001
00:57:21,701 --> 00:57:26,410
afraid of shit. It doesn't
seem like it. Yeah. Cause
fucking brother's a month. Any,

1002
00:57:26,411 --> 00:57:29,590
he was sort of what an imprinted them
at such a young age too, you know.

1003
00:57:29,591 --> 00:57:30,670
I mean I think that's it too.

1004
00:57:30,671 --> 00:57:34,330
You get these things impressed on your
flesh at a young age and you don't forget

1005
00:57:34,331 --> 00:57:38,530
those lessons. Yeah. Brothers
are a big one, man. It's
usually, for whatever reason,

1006
00:57:38,531 --> 00:57:42,220
the younger brother, that's the real beast
because the younger brother and doors,

1007
00:57:42,221 --> 00:57:45,120
the beatings at the older brother gives
him and because of that it develops this

1008
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:50,020
sorta steely determination. It's quite
frightening. I could totally see that.

1009
00:57:50,021 --> 00:57:53,920
That's totally makes sense.
Both on a physical level,
but on an emotional kind of,

1010
00:57:54,350 --> 00:57:55,480
um,
you know,

1011
00:57:55,481 --> 00:57:59,410
you're getting that adamantium kind of
mindset about things and just got to keep

1012
00:57:59,411 --> 00:58:03,170
prevailing. I've always thought to like,
because I do watch a lot of MMA and,

1013
00:58:03,171 --> 00:58:06,310
and I, I love it both as a
sport and boxing as well,

1014
00:58:06,311 --> 00:58:09,900
but also like the psychological aspect
of it really fascinates me and I've,

1015
00:58:10,370 --> 00:58:14,350
I've always felt like how
painful it must be to come up.

1016
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:17,140
I always think about like Michael
Jordan and who were, you know,

1017
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:19,180
we would think differently
of Dominique Wilson,

1018
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:21,520
w Wilkins if Michael Jordan ever existed.

1019
00:58:21,521 --> 00:58:26,470
And I think we think differently of so
many fighters if GSP hadn't existed or,

1020
00:58:26,830 --> 00:58:31,600
or Silva or, you know, Jon Jones, these
sort of long reining sort of champions.

1021
00:58:31,950 --> 00:58:36,280
Um, and, uh, and, and I, I, you would
know better having been been through it,

1022
00:58:36,281 --> 00:58:39,520
but there's, you know what I mean?
There's that next level who can't quite,

1023
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:41,800
you know, they have their one
shot, they can't quite clear it.

1024
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:46,870
And some are lucky to have another op
opportunity at as sort of Gulf go back at

1025
00:58:46,871 --> 00:58:50,980
it and can still make a good career
for themselves. But I find that MMA,

1026
00:58:50,981 --> 00:58:52,240
especially in the UFC right now,

1027
00:58:52,241 --> 00:58:55,030
is there's some long reigning
champions and the peep,

1028
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:57,490
and that's what people love.
You know, they sort of love,

1029
00:58:57,550 --> 00:58:59,290
but all the focus is on them.

1030
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:03,040
And then these people think the guys
underneath who could be awesome,

1031
00:59:03,041 --> 00:59:07,010
where it not for, for a GSP. That's
the whole purpose. I knew champion.

1032
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:11,680
That's right. Dominant other
over other savages. Yeah,

1033
00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:12,370
that's,

1034
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:17,080
that's the thing about the being the
second best guy who could have been a

1035
00:59:17,081 --> 00:59:21,100
champion in any other era. That's gotta
be so mad. I wouldn't it be, yeah.

1036
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:26,180
A junior dos Santos is a good example of
that. People always compare jr junior,

1037
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:30,800
junior dos Santos was the champion.
He knocked out Cain Velasquez. Right?

1038
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:34,070
But it was at a time where
Cain Velasquez was injured.

1039
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:37,010
He tore a ligament in his knee.
His knee was all fucked up.

1040
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:40,400
He didn't have good mobility and
junior caught him with a big punch.

1041
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:44,330
Then they fought two more
times and Cain destroy them.

1042
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:50,100
Freedom from pillar to post probably
took years off of his life with those

1043
00:59:50,151 --> 00:59:54,290
beatings. I had friends who were martial
artists and fighters and you know,

1044
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:57,290
either former pro fighters are guys have
been involved in fighting their whole

1045
00:59:57,291 --> 01:00:01,970
life. Who universally texted me
and emailed me and said, dude,

1046
01:00:01,971 --> 01:00:04,070
that fight took years off that guy's life.
They could,

1047
01:00:04,071 --> 01:00:08,420
they just felt it even watching,
especially the second one, the, the, the,

1048
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:13,310
the, the uh, the third one rather than
the last one. The um, the second rematch,

1049
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:17,630
just unbelievable. Beating
the Canaan. Canaan,

1050
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:20,260
he doesn't knock you out.
He just malls you and,

1051
01:00:20,261 --> 01:00:24,320
and really just reduces you in some
terrible way. Well, he keeps a pace.

1052
01:00:24,321 --> 01:00:28,940
It's almost inhuman for a heavyweight
and heavyweight for 240 pound man to keep

1053
01:00:28,941 --> 01:00:32,090
up with him. Good fucking luck.
It's probably not going to happen.

1054
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:35,840
And a lot of that's genetic. Like I
talked to Bob Cook, who's his trainer.

1055
01:00:35,841 --> 01:00:39,710
He said that guy could go a couple of
months outside of training, get injured,

1056
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:42,020
be out for a couple months,
then come back in and out work.

1057
01:00:42,021 --> 01:00:45,830
Everybody just doesn't get
out of shape and you, wow.

1058
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:50,300
Mexicans are kind of known for that.
There's some tough fight boxers too.

1059
01:00:50,301 --> 01:00:54,500
Like it's a, it's a, it seems like
a tough culture. Fuck Mexicans.

1060
01:00:54,501 --> 01:00:58,490
I think some of the grittiest
toughest fighters of all time.

1061
01:00:58,550 --> 01:01:02,960
I totally MMA or boxing the N in
during endurance to their stamina.

1062
01:01:02,990 --> 01:01:06,170
It's just shocking and they just, they
don't stop. They don't, you're right.

1063
01:01:06,171 --> 01:01:09,470
They're sorta just like, you're going to
have to hit me with a house like Julio,

1064
01:01:09,471 --> 01:01:13,370
Cesar Chavez. You remember when that
guy has to fight? He would just ding.

1065
01:01:13,371 --> 01:01:16,520
The Bell had rung ring and
he just start moving forward,

1066
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:19,820
throwing a barrage of punches that
will never end until you drop.

1067
01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:23,720
And he fought like didn't he have an
enormous record in terms of like I thought

1068
01:01:23,721 --> 01:01:27,560
like a hundred fights or something and
more than that he had 197 fights before

1069
01:01:27,561 --> 01:01:32,050
he ever suffered a loss. Yeah, that's,
that's how it was. [inaudible] 97 and Oh,

1070
01:01:32,410 --> 01:01:34,910
you ever saw for careers of
some other fighters, you know,

1071
01:01:34,911 --> 01:01:38,420
in terms of overall records or,
sure, yeah. Yeah. So yeah, that's,

1072
01:01:38,421 --> 01:01:42,320
I mean a lot of fighters today in this
day and age don't fight nearly as many

1073
01:01:42,321 --> 01:01:44,060
times as they used to back in the day.

1074
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:49,290
Like a guy like Floyd Mayweather who's
like 45 oh 46 and oh I think 46 in our

1075
01:01:50,530 --> 01:01:53,150
laughter, that's unbelievable. Like,

1076
01:01:53,151 --> 01:01:57,420
but 97 and oh that's so insane.

1077
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:00,620
97 fights period, you know, and
that's right before he hit a loss.

1078
01:02:00,621 --> 01:02:04,250
And then I feel like, I could be
wrong, but I feel the wheels fell off.

1079
01:02:04,251 --> 01:02:06,410
That's actually the, one
of the quotes is, you know,

1080
01:02:06,411 --> 01:02:09,800
like on a long enough timeline.
Any, any fighting stories?

1081
01:02:09,801 --> 01:02:12,830
Usually it can be a tragic one.
And I find that happens less than MMA.

1082
01:02:12,831 --> 01:02:16,360
I feel like guys, no one to retire
better in MMA than inboxing.

1083
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:19,130
I feel like people hang onto the rope
a little too close. That was true.

1084
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:23,490
I wish it was really think it is. No,
no. Chocolate. Dell definitely didn't.

1085
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:26,580
And I was almost going to
mention chuck Liddell was like,

1086
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:30,450
because he did get rocked his last
couple of fights and that it's made some.

1087
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:32,490
Yeah. Yeah. Well not just that.

1088
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:35,400
The only reason why I stopped fighting
was Dana White because Dana just said

1089
01:02:35,401 --> 01:02:38,580
that's it. Yeah. Dan is very
close with them and said,

1090
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:42,420
I see what's going on here and maybe
you don't because you're the fighter.

1091
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:43,463
You got to stop.

1092
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:47,100
The thing about fighters is they have
this belief in themselves and it's just,

1093
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:50,640
it's never ending and unflappable
and especially the champions.

1094
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:52,830
They always think,
I know everybody's count me out,

1095
01:02:52,831 --> 01:02:54,680
but I'm gonna figure out a
way to beat this motherfucker.

1096
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:57,350
They go into that ring with
that determination. Yeah.

1097
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:59,640
And that's what made them a
champion in the first place.

1098
01:02:59,641 --> 01:03:04,620
But that's also what that fails them.
When,

1099
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:09,240
when it comes down to like
objective thinking and being
introspective about your

1100
01:03:09,241 --> 01:03:11,400
abilities and how much you've diminished,

1101
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:15,630
it's that sort of bulletproof belief in
themselves that winds up fucking them

1102
01:03:15,631 --> 01:03:20,160
over. Yeah. And I think it's also
too there. They're young, right?

1103
01:03:20,161 --> 01:03:23,170
I mean comparatively, I know
my, when my dad retired, uh,

1104
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:26,670
it was like a trap door open under his
life in a way because he was like used to

1105
01:03:26,671 --> 01:03:29,880
having this routine to his life and you
look forward to it. But I think, you know,

1106
01:03:29,881 --> 01:03:33,150
the first week you're like, oh, this is
great. And then the second week it's like,

1107
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:35,670
what the, what the hell am
I doing? I feel like my,

1108
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:39,690
and then if you're looking down the
barrel of that, when you're at 60, 65,

1109
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,520
well that's one thing when you're
looking down the barrel of that,

1110
01:03:41,521 --> 01:03:45,750
when you're 32, 33 something like it's
gotta be a different, this is what I was,

1111
01:03:45,870 --> 01:03:47,670
this is what I'm good at.
This is all I'm good at.

1112
01:03:47,671 --> 01:03:50,880
I think some of them might think
and, and then it's like, God,

1113
01:03:50,881 --> 01:03:54,600
I've got a long existence ahead of
me doing what? What am I doing next?

1114
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:56,760
And nothing is ever going
to match the thrill.

1115
01:03:56,761 --> 01:04:00,030
The fighting will never feel that or
I'll never feel something like that.

1116
01:04:00,031 --> 01:04:01,980
You know what I mean?
I feel like that must be,

1117
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:04,710
I don't know if you've talked to fight,
did they ever,

1118
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:08,580
are they good at describing
what that feeling is like? Well,

1119
01:04:08,581 --> 01:04:12,180
I think the only person that's ever going
to truly understand what it's like to

1120
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:16,710
say like be Jon Jones and enter into a
world championship fight with the whole

1121
01:04:16,711 --> 01:04:21,180
world watching cage door
shuts and the Bruce buffer,

1122
01:04:21,181 --> 01:04:24,720
it's time. They're the only ones
that will ever understand that.

1123
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:26,010
I will never understand it.

1124
01:04:26,011 --> 01:04:30,670
I've watched and I've done commentary and
more than a thousand right in the ring.

1125
01:04:30,671 --> 01:04:33,610
You're when the endorphins are still
there. When the fuck's going on,

1126
01:04:34,430 --> 01:04:37,670
I'm completely outside and I've competed.
I've kickbox and of course, yeah,

1127
01:04:37,830 --> 01:04:40,680
probably a hundred taekwondo matches.
Doesn't matter.

1128
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:44,310
I just don't know what's going on when
that's happening. I just, I can't imagine.

1129
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:48,300
I literally can't imagine. Do you think
it's a different level than cause I mean,

1130
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:51,420
I mean it's a different level
in some way in the fat and the,

1131
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:54,300
in the sort of the crowd response in
the idea of how many eyes are on you.

1132
01:04:54,301 --> 01:04:57,270
But I mean when you stepped in
or even when I've done fighting,

1133
01:04:57,510 --> 01:05:01,830
it's still you and another guy. So I
wonder how far removed is our experience.

1134
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:06,150
You know what I mean? Pretty far
assume it is. Certainly in terms of,

1135
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:09,180
but I mean I felt like I was amped
up to the point where every one of my

1136
01:05:09,181 --> 01:05:13,920
synapsis was screaming. I'm just not built
to do that. You know, maybe they have,

1137
01:05:13,921 --> 01:05:15,000
maybe there's a calmness.

1138
01:05:15,001 --> 01:05:18,100
I feel like sometimes you look
and they're the top fighters

1139
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:20,870
are able to kind of establish a
certain calmness that, that I,

1140
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:24,370
I've never really found.
And when in those situations in my life,

1141
01:05:24,371 --> 01:05:28,840
whether it's a playground scuffle or,
or you know, an amateur boxing match,

1142
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:29,703
well the calmness,

1143
01:05:29,850 --> 01:05:34,850
a lot of it comes with the experience
itself being something that you recognize

1144
01:05:35,611 --> 01:05:37,770
and you've been there before and
you know how to deal with it.

1145
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:39,420
Whereas someone who has never,

1146
01:05:39,421 --> 01:05:43,740
like if you took a guy who has never
competed at all before and you throw them

1147
01:05:43,741 --> 01:05:46,620
in a UFC fight, they would
fucking shit their pants. Yeah.

1148
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:50,310
Especially if they didn't know how to
fight at all and there's so many things to

1149
01:05:50,311 --> 01:05:52,670
deal with, it would be overwhelming.
They probably have a heart attack. Yeah.

1150
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:56,880
But if you take a guy like a Jon Jones,
because we keep talking about him,

1151
01:05:57,630 --> 01:06:02,520
trains his whole life in a wrestling.
So he's wrestled for many,

1152
01:06:02,521 --> 01:06:05,100
many years,
competed a very high level in wrestling,

1153
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:09,390
then started competing
in MMA trains every day,

1154
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:13,860
constantly in the gym, constantly working
out with these really high level guys.

1155
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,030
It becomes,

1156
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:18,930
you have a comfort level with like
just the recognition of what this is.

1157
01:06:19,230 --> 01:06:21,990
You understand it, you get in
there, you know what you can do,

1158
01:06:21,991 --> 01:06:24,870
you're very aware of what you're capable
of because you have literally pushed

1159
01:06:24,871 --> 01:06:29,871
yourself to your limits and training and
you get in there and you're much calmer

1160
01:06:30,751 --> 01:06:33,600
than a person who's completely
alien to the experience.

1161
01:06:33,870 --> 01:06:37,110
So I think for you like
doing it a couple of times,

1162
01:06:37,111 --> 01:06:39,290
like you didn't have a chance
to get used to it. No, not,

1163
01:06:39,450 --> 01:06:40,560
there's a lot of guys who do,

1164
01:06:40,590 --> 01:06:45,090
who are probably similarly
gifted or not gifted,

1165
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:49,560
not gifted as the way a lot of
not gifted guys go very far.

1166
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:52,870
Just through hard work and
determination and yeah. Yeah.

1167
01:06:52,970 --> 01:06:56,900
What they don't ever do is beat the
great ones. No, that's the difference.

1168
01:06:57,380 --> 01:07:00,860
The not gifted guys
can have great careers.

1169
01:07:00,861 --> 01:07:03,800
They can get a lot out of the competition.
They can become coaches,

1170
01:07:03,801 --> 01:07:08,390
they can train fighters, they
can, they can become commentators.

1171
01:07:08,420 --> 01:07:11,560
They can do a lot of things, but they
can never figure out a way to beat the

1172
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:14,990
great one. No, no, no.
I feel like that's, um,

1173
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:18,540
in my experience watching as well,
there's that kind of, that's,

1174
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:22,500
that's a separation level. It's, it's
as much as your heart and your talent.

1175
01:07:22,501 --> 01:07:23,400
And there there is,
you know,

1176
01:07:23,401 --> 01:07:27,150
hearts is something that is one of
these ephemeral qualities that no one,

1177
01:07:27,151 --> 01:07:29,700
but I mean there is there, I mean
there are fighters that, you know,

1178
01:07:29,701 --> 01:07:31,680
that's what they have.
That's what's getting them through.

1179
01:07:31,681 --> 01:07:33,390
It's not necessarily they're talented.
They're,

1180
01:07:34,290 --> 01:07:37,830
I think heart is a combination of a lot
of things that are kind of impossible to

1181
01:07:37,831 --> 01:07:41,430
quantify. But you can, you can
see it in, in different athletes.

1182
01:07:41,431 --> 01:07:44,250
Doesn't have to be a fighter that seems
to be where it's most obvious to notice

1183
01:07:44,251 --> 01:07:47,190
it. But there's lots of
athletes that I like and,

1184
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:51,630
and usually it's because they have some
quality of heart that distinguishes them

1185
01:07:51,631 --> 01:07:55,050
in my eyes. And it's, they're not
the best, but they're just there.

1186
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:58,110
But they've taken their
skills as far as they can go.

1187
01:07:58,260 --> 01:08:01,560
Well that's why everybody loved Arturo
Gotti and make you worse. Of course,

1188
01:08:01,561 --> 01:08:05,240
those are the, that's a classic
to heart guys going up against.

1189
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:09,300
Never quit. You can beat them up, you
could knock them out, you could stop them,

1190
01:08:09,570 --> 01:08:11,940
but there will was never what

1191
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:16,010
faltered. No, no, absolutely.
And it had, they had more uh,

1192
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:16,640
yeah.

1193
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:20,540
Who knows what their limit would have
been necessarily or have they have trained

1194
01:08:20,541 --> 01:08:24,500
more intelligently repeated, more
intelligently. I mean a lot of that.

1195
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:28,730
What, what is talent, you know, we'll,
it's the approach that you take.

1196
01:08:29,030 --> 01:08:32,300
If you look at the way Arturo God, he
moved and punched, he was very talented.

1197
01:08:32,330 --> 01:08:33,290
He was, wasn't it? Yeah,

1198
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:38,320
most likely that he probably just wasn't
trained correctly or to the best of his

1199
01:08:39,201 --> 01:08:40,034
ability.
You know,

1200
01:08:40,150 --> 01:08:44,600
if you got a guy like a manual steward
who gets a hold of a boxer from the time

1201
01:08:44,601 --> 01:08:49,601
that he first starts and teaches him
just incredibly perfect technique,

1202
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:54,880
perfect strategy. The
mindset, like a customer,

1203
01:08:54,890 --> 01:08:58,970
what he did with Mike Tyson molds
his mindset. You know, you can,

1204
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,420
you can do something that if the
guy grows up with some, you know,

1205
01:09:02,421 --> 01:09:05,150
Midwest boxing club in the middle of
nowhere with a guy who doesn't really know

1206
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:06,650
how to box and that's the guys teach him.

1207
01:09:06,651 --> 01:09:08,240
That's the guy brings it
through his amateur career.

1208
01:09:08,241 --> 01:09:10,040
And that's the guy who
turns him into a pro.

1209
01:09:10,041 --> 01:09:14,960
That guy might be lacking and just giant
chunks of knowledge that a guy like say

1210
01:09:14,961 --> 01:09:18,680
a Freddie Roach has.
Yeah. Yeah. You just, you,

1211
01:09:18,710 --> 01:09:23,030
you never know what would create a
champion out of a contender. Yeah.

1212
01:09:23,031 --> 01:09:25,890
Sometimes it's just the, it's
the, the mentor he runs in.

1213
01:09:26,050 --> 01:09:29,680
Yeah. I think that, I think that's,
and I, I feel like that's true. Yeah.

1214
01:09:29,681 --> 01:09:31,330
And also even mid fight,
you know,

1215
01:09:31,331 --> 01:09:35,020
because Gaddy was so many UCM sell drawn
into firefights when he didn't need to,

1216
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:36,370
you know, and, and, uh,

1217
01:09:36,371 --> 01:09:39,520
whether he's really listening
to his trainer at that
point or not, I don't know.

1218
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:44,170
Um, but I know for me to even, even the
amateur, uh, things that I did, what I,

1219
01:09:44,171 --> 01:09:46,900
what I really took away from it and
what I really enjoyed was that was the

1220
01:09:46,901 --> 01:09:51,730
training part of it. You know, I trained,
um, I was living in Iowa at the time and,

1221
01:09:51,731 --> 01:09:56,140
uh, there was, uh, a boxing club at
the bottom of like a really sort of,

1222
01:09:56,730 --> 01:09:59,710
it was at the bottom of a gold's gym
and Coral Hill, which is sort of like,

1223
01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:02,570
just outside of Iowa city. And, uh,

1224
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:07,390
it was run by a coach and to
two girls to a female fighters,

1225
01:10:07,420 --> 01:10:11,380
the Kleinfelter sisters.
And they were like one 30,

1226
01:10:11,381 --> 01:10:15,940
one of them was maybe one 30. One of
them was like one 15, tough, I mean,

1227
01:10:15,941 --> 01:10:18,580
tough as nails fast and you'd,
you'd spar.

1228
01:10:18,581 --> 01:10:21,610
Like I knew I was going to have to
get in this amateur boxing match.

1229
01:10:22,150 --> 01:10:25,920
And so I was like, well, don't you
better not let be easy on me and I don't,

1230
01:10:25,921 --> 01:10:29,820
I did not going to be able to really punch
a girl. I didn't think, you know, and I,

1231
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:33,040
I ultimately, I wasn't able to,
but even if I wanted to punch them,

1232
01:10:33,041 --> 01:10:36,040
I don't think I would have really been
able to lay leather on them because they

1233
01:10:36,041 --> 01:10:40,210
were fast and they were mean. And they
were, uh, and even if I did touch them,

1234
01:10:40,211 --> 01:10:43,810
they'd be like, you know, you, you
punch like a softy. Like this is weak,

1235
01:10:43,870 --> 01:10:46,200
weak ass shit. Uh, so, so,

1236
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:50,140
but what I really took away from it is
really enjoying the, uh, the discipline,

1237
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:54,310
you know, with nutrition and with
the roadwork. I mean, I could,

1238
01:10:54,311 --> 01:10:55,960
I did all that stuff.
I love doing that.

1239
01:10:55,961 --> 01:10:58,630
And I felt like that was the only thing
that I could actually take into my own

1240
01:10:58,631 --> 01:11:03,280
hands and that I had some sort of,
um, agency in, you know what I mean?

1241
01:11:03,281 --> 01:11:07,410
I can run as hard and as far and I can,
I can hit the bag for,

1242
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:10,390
until my arms feel like noodles.
That's all that I can do.

1243
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:14,130
And you'll see a direct,
improve your skills. But also

1244
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:16,890
there was a limit. Like, I mean,
and the one thing that I noticed,

1245
01:11:16,891 --> 01:11:18,270
and I've said it before,
is like,

1246
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:21,750
and I feel like other people have
noticed this because I've gotten a lot of

1247
01:11:21,751 --> 01:11:24,000
fights when I was young,
but I don't think I ever won one.

1248
01:11:24,270 --> 01:11:29,190
And I feel like I must exude this kind
of waft of something that like I just am

1249
01:11:29,191 --> 01:11:32,280
not a fighter,
but every time I've gotten in a fight,

1250
01:11:32,281 --> 01:11:35,040
it's been more that someone is,
I feel like it's taking,

1251
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:38,400
trying to take advantage of me or has
been picking on me for a long period of

1252
01:11:38,401 --> 01:11:41,160
time. And it's the only way that this is
going to stop or have been or have been

1253
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:44,370
picking on someone that I cared about.
And,

1254
01:11:44,790 --> 01:11:49,790
and I always got the sense afterwards
that the person who beat me up basically a

1255
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:52,230
new, what? New? That they're like, they,

1256
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:56,460
I can draw Davidson into a
fight and I'll, and, and he'll,

1257
01:11:56,490 --> 01:11:58,800
he'll willingly go in,
he'll go into the bear trap,

1258
01:11:59,370 --> 01:12:00,750
and then I'll just be able to beat him up.

1259
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:03,460
And the only good thing about
it ultimately is that they,

1260
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:06,330
the picking on stuff stopped,
you know what I mean?

1261
01:12:06,331 --> 01:12:10,530
But I had to take a beating in order
to sort of affect that, you know?

1262
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:11,971
Yeah.

1263
01:12:11,971 --> 01:12:16,971
That's a weird psychological sort of a
relationship between the bully and the,

1264
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:20,640
the person who gets picked on.
Yeah. Yeah. But I feel like,

1265
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:23,970
and I feel like the real true fighters
wouldn't even do something like that.

1266
01:12:23,971 --> 01:12:26,100
They would recognize
why, you know, this guy,

1267
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:29,860
or I'm not going to bother with this guy.
I mean, I have mother. Yeah. I mean, May,

1268
01:12:29,890 --> 01:12:30,950
may, I don't know. Maybe,

1269
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:34,980
maybe there are some writers who like to
beat the shit out of people. Yeah. Yeah.

1270
01:12:34,981 --> 01:12:35,250
You've,

1271
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:38,700
I'm even noticing fight sometimes I feel
like that guy looks like he probably

1272
01:12:38,701 --> 01:12:41,910
might have, would be happy to be
beating up someone with far less skill.

1273
01:12:41,911 --> 01:12:46,440
He taking as much delight in it as he is.
Usually they'd been abused. Is that so,

1274
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:50,720
yeah. I believe that's a big
part of, uh, a lot of what,

1275
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:54,420
what constitutes a bully is
physical abuse. You know,

1276
01:12:54,421 --> 01:12:58,200
that they've been abused either at home
or they've been abused by other kids and

1277
01:12:58,201 --> 01:13:00,210
they're trying to lash out and get theirs.

1278
01:13:00,211 --> 01:13:04,950
Now they've sort of taken on the role of
the bully because they've been bullied

1279
01:13:04,951 --> 01:13:09,210
so much. That happens a lot. I could
see that. I actually, here's the,

1280
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:12,970
here's the sort of a story of
my, one of my worst beatings. Uh,

1281
01:13:12,971 --> 01:13:16,230
I was at the YMC hey,
me and my brother were playing basketball.

1282
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:18,800
That was probably like
16, 17, eight times my,

1283
01:13:18,801 --> 01:13:22,440
of my last year of high school probably.
And these two guys come and say, let's,

1284
01:13:22,530 --> 01:13:26,220
let's play two on two. So we did, and
back then I probably weighed like two 40.

1285
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:31,050
I was, uh, I was a big fat dude, you
know, I just tee it 40 in the high school.

1286
01:13:31,370 --> 01:13:36,300
Yeah, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe two 30,
like I was enormous, but it was not a,

1287
01:13:36,301 --> 01:13:40,770
it was not a healthy weight obviously.
What do you weigh now? One 75,

1288
01:13:40,771 --> 01:13:43,980
one eight or something like that.
So that's partly the whole boxing stuff.

1289
01:13:43,981 --> 01:13:45,810
And we do tree planting
a lot up in Canada.

1290
01:13:45,811 --> 01:13:47,490
That's sort of like what
you do at university.

1291
01:13:47,491 --> 01:13:49,280
You just go up to the woods
and plant trees and that.

1292
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:52,650
I shed a lot of weight that way,
uh, during, during university.

1293
01:13:52,651 --> 01:13:54,650
But so I was a big beast,
you know,

1294
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:57,750
and I sort of knew how to use my body and
the guy that I was playing against was

1295
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:00,140
maybe one, one 60. Um,

1296
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:03,720
so we were getting close to beat them
and I turned around and I see the ball,

1297
01:14:03,721 --> 01:14:05,220
it's whipping right at my face.

1298
01:14:05,221 --> 01:14:08,730
He'd thrown it at me and I turned my head
and it sort of goes by the side of my

1299
01:14:08,731 --> 01:14:12,640
head and just, you know, it gives
me a scalp basically. And then he's,

1300
01:14:12,730 --> 01:14:16,140
then he's charging right at me.
Like to get in no fight. Um,

1301
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:20,710
and there was no pro prior product? No,
none at all. That's the thing. I mean,

1302
01:14:20,711 --> 01:14:25,450
this guy, just a basketball, just a
basketball game and, and, and, okay.

1303
01:14:25,451 --> 01:14:26,710
It's in the why. So I'm like, okay,

1304
01:14:26,711 --> 01:14:28,480
well we're not going to have a fight
right in the middle of the why.

1305
01:14:28,481 --> 01:14:30,610
I think I'm going to be
okay. That's, I mean,

1306
01:14:30,611 --> 01:14:32,170
I didn't really want to get into a fight,
but again,

1307
01:14:32,171 --> 01:14:35,410
this guy's throwing a basketball. I mean,
it's pretty shitty move. So anyways,

1308
01:14:35,411 --> 01:14:37,570
this guy comes out,
he's gotta be like 80 years old.

1309
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:41,830
He's like one of those guys at the y
that was like a retired gym teacher and

1310
01:14:41,831 --> 01:14:46,630
they sort of said, okay bill, you can
just hang out around here and keep order.

1311
01:14:46,660 --> 01:14:48,010
That's the be nice of you to do that.

1312
01:14:48,011 --> 01:14:51,190
So he comes out and he's got a whistle
around like an old p whistle around his

1313
01:14:51,191 --> 01:14:55,600
neck, knee. He says, take it
outside. I'm like, I don't,

1314
01:14:55,960 --> 01:15:00,580
the last thing I want to do is take this
outside, but, and, and, and he says,

1315
01:15:00,610 --> 01:15:03,010
that's it guys. You take this
outside. So I'm like, Oh,

1316
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:06,490
I'm sort of like being shoe horned into
going out to having a fight with this

1317
01:15:06,491 --> 01:15:10,840
guy. So I'm going down the hallway
and my brother is, he should,

1318
01:15:10,841 --> 01:15:13,840
he's massaging my shoulders cause I
guess he thinks that's what he should be

1319
01:15:13,841 --> 01:15:17,500
doing. You know, that's how little we
know about fighting. You know what I mean?

1320
01:15:17,501 --> 01:15:20,350
He's, my brother was like,
well I guess I've seen this
in rocky. I should keep him,

1321
01:15:20,710 --> 01:15:24,910
keep him limber and you know, he's like,
you're, you're going to be fine. And if I,

1322
01:15:24,911 --> 01:15:27,550
but I had a chance to look in his
eyes, he'd be like, you are, you are,

1323
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:30,370
you are fucked. You know what I
mean? And I, I think I knew that too.

1324
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:35,590
So I ended up outside, it's winter
in Canada and there's ice on the,

1325
01:15:35,591 --> 01:15:38,680
on the, on the sidewalk. And you know, I,

1326
01:15:38,770 --> 01:15:42,130
I face up and what I assume is somewhat
somewhat of a fighting posture.

1327
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:43,990
And he kicks me in the head.

1328
01:15:44,170 --> 01:15:47,230
It's the first thing he does just
like kicked me right in the head.

1329
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:50,890
And I'm not even sure what that will
happen. I'm still standing, you know,

1330
01:15:50,950 --> 01:15:54,670
and they need does it again. And
then I'm like, Oh God, this is not,

1331
01:15:54,730 --> 01:15:59,380
this is not good. So he had martial arts
training. Yeah, definitely. And then,

1332
01:15:59,381 --> 01:16:01,610
you know, there was a bike rack.
And I remember he like rang my,

1333
01:16:01,670 --> 01:16:06,160
my head off of it and I'd get them in
a, you know, sort of a headlock. And,

1334
01:16:06,790 --> 01:16:10,930
uh, and I remember being like face down
and there's like ice melts on the street,

1335
01:16:10,931 --> 01:16:13,870
you know, that those blue crystals
they put down, you know, and I'm, I'm,

1336
01:16:13,871 --> 01:16:17,910
my face is pressed into it and thankfully
it goes on for a while. Clearly I'm,

1337
01:16:17,911 --> 01:16:21,730
I'm beat. And he's like, are you, are we,
are we had enough here? I'm like, yeah,

1338
01:16:21,790 --> 01:16:23,290
I mean, I've, I've had
enough. That's enough.

1339
01:16:23,380 --> 01:16:26,150
So he goes back inside
chuckling with his buddy. Um,

1340
01:16:26,350 --> 01:16:27,820
I'm sitting out there
on the street bleeding.

1341
01:16:28,090 --> 01:16:30,220
I don't even want to go back into the why,
you know what I mean?

1342
01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:32,470
I'm going to have the people inside going,
what the hell happened?

1343
01:16:32,471 --> 01:16:36,290
Do you need help? And I'm like, I just
want to crawl into a hole and, you know,

1344
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:41,200
not see humanity for about a month.
Uh, so my brother goes inside,

1345
01:16:41,201 --> 01:16:44,170
gets my clothes, we go, I
find out later, this guy,

1346
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:47,650
we lacrosse is a big sport in our,
in our country.

1347
01:16:47,830 --> 01:16:52,180
And he was like the enforcer
on the Lacrosse Lacrosse team,

1348
01:16:52,181 --> 01:16:55,990
like the triple a Lacrosse team.
So he was a tough guy.

1349
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:59,260
Like I didn't have a chance.
You know right from the get go,

1350
01:16:59,261 --> 01:17:02,140
I didn't have a chance.
And then, you know,

1351
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:05,050
I discover his name cause we lived
in a small town. And you sort of,

1352
01:17:05,051 --> 01:17:09,000
these things sort of come to you,
uh, as time goes by and then, um,

1353
01:17:09,020 --> 01:17:10,910
my buddy calls me up,
but a couple of years later he says,

1354
01:17:10,911 --> 01:17:14,120
did you hear about so and so? I said, no,
I was away at university at this point.

1355
01:17:14,121 --> 01:17:18,050
He's like, they went camping in
the woods and hit him and his dad.

1356
01:17:18,110 --> 01:17:22,670
And this word gets back to your idea
of abuse. He stabbed his dad 44 times,

1357
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:24,193
killed him,

1358
01:17:24,590 --> 01:17:28,500
killed him in the woods and they caught
him just walking down the street with

1359
01:17:28,501 --> 01:17:32,570
the knife in his hand. And, uh, and
you know, later on the interview,

1360
01:17:32,571 --> 01:17:36,470
his mom and his mom was like,
yeah, he was, uh, you know,

1361
01:17:36,650 --> 01:17:38,630
he basically would sit out
on the porch saying that he,

1362
01:17:38,690 --> 01:17:41,270
George Bush was going to come
in air force one anytime,

1363
01:17:41,271 --> 01:17:43,820
pick them up for some top secret mission.
So we clearly had some,

1364
01:17:44,570 --> 01:17:48,080
some mental instabilities that didn't
present themselves at the age at which at

1365
01:17:48,081 --> 01:17:50,600
least they were maybe emerging,
but later,

1366
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:54,980
I mean that part had never been been into,
I'm not,

1367
01:17:54,981 --> 01:17:58,690
I can't really comment
on that, but I mean, I,

1368
01:17:59,630 --> 01:18:03,230
I don't know, but I think I feel
like he stabbed the man 44 times.

1369
01:18:03,231 --> 01:18:06,380
He would have to be a really heated
argument and if they had no prior sort of

1370
01:18:07,070 --> 01:18:09,680
history with one another, I
don't, I don't really know.

1371
01:18:09,681 --> 01:18:13,460
But first of all that he stabbed him
and then he stabbed him that many times.

1372
01:18:13,490 --> 01:18:17,810
Holy Shit. Yeah. And I thought a thought
later, like, man, as bad as I got it,

1373
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:21,080
I mean, I could've gotten a lot
worse. You know what I mean?

1374
01:18:21,081 --> 01:18:24,040
At least he let me off at the
end. He's like, all right, well

1375
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:27,450
I always try to explain that someone
who gives people the finger in a car,

1376
01:18:27,451 --> 01:18:30,110
like you never know who you're
giving the finger to. Exactly. My,

1377
01:18:30,140 --> 01:18:34,350
my wife has a bad habit of
honking the horn. I'm like,
baby, I love you, but don't,

1378
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:35,730
don't do it.
Don't do it.

1379
01:18:35,731 --> 01:18:38,690
Don't you don't know who
the hell is stepping out of
that fricking car. You know,

1380
01:18:38,710 --> 01:18:41,820
not only that,
you never know what state they're in.

1381
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:46,560
They can be in the worst state of mind
ever at the moment you lay on that horn,

1382
01:18:46,561 --> 01:18:48,740
you could have caught them
at the breaking point. Yeah.

1383
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:51,720
And that's what puts them fucking people.

1384
01:18:51,721 --> 01:18:55,650
Especially in this day and age when
you're dealing with cities and traffic and

1385
01:18:55,651 --> 01:19:00,651
the unnatural stress of slamming 200
fucking million people together like this.

1386
01:19:01,510 --> 01:19:06,120
Yeah. Yeah. They've done these
studies on, on population density, um,

1387
01:19:06,150 --> 01:19:11,150
just with rats and they've shown how
bizarre rat behavior gets when you get too

1388
01:19:11,281 --> 01:19:13,110
many rats and contained environment.

1389
01:19:13,111 --> 01:19:17,220
And it mirrors human being's
behavior as far as like human beings,

1390
01:19:17,221 --> 01:19:20,670
when you have a small amount of them,
you know,

1391
01:19:20,671 --> 01:19:23,760
everybody seems to get along fine,
but when you jam them together,

1392
01:19:23,761 --> 01:19:26,500
you started getting all
these mental illnesses. Well
that's what they do with a,

1393
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:31,020
they get rats. If you have a certain
amount of rats and you jam them into a,

1394
01:19:31,021 --> 01:19:33,270
a box there,
a certain amount of,

1395
01:19:33,271 --> 01:19:36,120
and we'll just sit in the corner and
start nodding their heads up and down and

1396
01:19:36,121 --> 01:19:38,090
back and forth and then
it gets really hard.

1397
01:19:38,430 --> 01:19:40,730
Yeah. Yeah. I found that same thing.

1398
01:19:40,770 --> 01:19:44,040
I used to work at a place called
marine land in Niagara Falls,

1399
01:19:44,041 --> 01:19:45,010
which is like a seaworld.

1400
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:50,360
Yeah. We had a guy I'm on that worked
at marine. Oh really? Yeah, yeah.

1401
01:19:50,390 --> 01:19:52,280
Was involved in,
um,

1402
01:19:52,890 --> 01:19:56,040
this fucking horrible situation with,
uh,

1403
01:19:56,070 --> 01:20:00,660
with dolphins and he had to the fuck is
his name, Phil. Phil DeMaurice. Oh, Shit.

1404
01:20:00,661 --> 01:20:03,900
You got him. I interviewed him for an
article. I did feel dimmers. Yeah. Okay.

1405
01:20:03,901 --> 01:20:08,240
Of course. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And
he was explaining us the smoosh it all

1406
01:20:08,490 --> 01:20:10,770
smooshy Walrus. Walrus, yeah. Yeah.

1407
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:13,980
It was also explained to
us how intelligent these
dolphins are and the dolphins

1408
01:20:14,030 --> 01:20:14,940
go on hunger strikes.

1409
01:20:14,941 --> 01:20:18,240
They have to force feed them and that
they take them away from their mothers and

1410
01:20:18,241 --> 01:20:22,950
they buy them from Russians.
Yeah. Or really ruthless
the way they, they capture.

1411
01:20:23,180 --> 01:20:28,180
Yeah. Yeah. I know it's, it's, it's, it's
rough. It's rough stuff. Yeah. So anyway,

1412
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:31,670
you got, you got all that already from
Phil and Phil was an insider. Phil was,

1413
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:35,270
Phil was there after I was there
and I think things got some,

1414
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:37,690
I mean it was never a trainer either,
but you know,

1415
01:20:37,810 --> 01:20:39,080
some of the things that those guys are,

1416
01:20:39,081 --> 01:20:42,950
the animal control guys
saw was pretty rough.

1417
01:20:42,951 --> 01:20:46,190
But that same thing as you perhaps so
many animals and if you did the same to

1418
01:20:46,191 --> 01:20:50,690
people, of course there's going to
be like mania, disturbing, you know,

1419
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:54,320
depression, all sorts of stuff that
we can sort of emote. You know,

1420
01:20:54,321 --> 01:20:56,690
animals can only sort of just
do it through their behavior.

1421
01:20:56,691 --> 01:21:00,320
You get a sense of like this is not right,
this, this rat is not in a good state.

1422
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:01,233
Well the zoo,

1423
01:21:01,270 --> 01:21:04,440
you ever go to the zoo and watch an animal
just pace back and forth and they're

1424
01:21:04,441 --> 01:21:07,550
small little container. Yeah.
And you're like, this is nuts.

1425
01:21:07,770 --> 01:21:12,770
I watched this bear once and he would
just walk to one area turnaround,

1426
01:21:12,950 --> 01:21:15,590
walk to the other, turn around
and go back and forth. Like,

1427
01:21:15,890 --> 01:21:19,290
that animal is going mad. They're
good. They're going, Matt there,

1428
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:23,970
their animals like bears,
they roam over miles and miles,

1429
01:21:24,190 --> 01:21:28,790
countryside. And that's how
their genes are sort of adopted.

1430
01:21:29,110 --> 01:21:30,640
They're,
they're adapted rather their,

1431
01:21:30,650 --> 01:21:34,940
their whole being is adapted
to this idea of nature,

1432
01:21:35,150 --> 01:21:38,330
providing them with food.
They go out and forge for the food.

1433
01:21:38,510 --> 01:21:42,200
When they just stuck in his box and the
food comes sliding under the door and a

1434
01:21:42,201 --> 01:21:47,030
tray every day, all their reward
systems are being rude up,

1435
01:21:47,031 --> 01:21:52,031
just ignored or contain that some
strange sort of a way and madness.

1436
01:21:52,350 --> 01:21:55,440
No, no, exactly. It, they, and
they find other ways, you know,

1437
01:21:55,470 --> 01:21:59,490
when you baffled all of those primal
instincts. Mm. Um, and I think, you know,

1438
01:21:59,491 --> 01:22:02,730
it's true. I, I, you know, we have a son
and will we take them to the Toronto zoo?

1439
01:22:02,731 --> 01:22:07,590
I mean, we might have to, where else can
you see all of those creatures? You know,

1440
01:22:07,591 --> 01:22:10,950
you can't just go out, you know, searching
the forest until you find a bear.

1441
01:22:10,951 --> 01:22:13,320
I mean you could. Um, but you,

1442
01:22:13,321 --> 01:22:16,950
you do it with the understanding that no
matter how nice the bear Penn is or the

1443
01:22:16,951 --> 01:22:21,930
gorilla enclosure it, you can't, it can't
do all the things that that gorilla,

1444
01:22:21,931 --> 01:22:26,160
you just have to hope that they have a
mind that is a bit more able to embrace

1445
01:22:26,161 --> 01:22:29,100
their new situation.
And some animals may be can,

1446
01:22:29,101 --> 01:22:32,010
but other animals just like
I'm built for this. And same,

1447
01:22:32,011 --> 01:22:34,730
same with some men who were
imprisoned. Like I'm not, you know,

1448
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:37,610
with the cool hand Luke sort of a
thing. I'm not built for this. Yeah.

1449
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:38,453
It ain't happening.

1450
01:22:38,830 --> 01:22:43,070
Yeah, I agree. I, I, and I have children
and I take them to the zoo, but the,

1451
01:22:43,071 --> 01:22:45,890
is that feeling like I
do it just cause my kids,

1452
01:22:46,010 --> 01:22:49,850
I want them to explore everything,
see as many things as possible.

1453
01:22:49,851 --> 01:22:52,700
But this is part of me that feels like
a big hypocrite because I don't want to

1454
01:22:52,701 --> 01:22:54,710
support contain these animals.
Yeah.

1455
01:22:54,740 --> 01:22:58,510
Fucking penguin and it's 90 degrees
out in la, like says fuck penguin.

1456
01:22:58,540 --> 01:23:01,540
Thinking no one's going to be
like, what am I doing here? What?

1457
01:23:01,610 --> 01:23:05,970
How did I get here anyways? Like, why is
it so lights went out and I'm, yeah, who's

1458
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:10,800
this guy in the blue suit feed me
fish and the fish are dead already.

1459
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:13,450
Yeah. Fuck what's going on? Well,
even getting them to learn to do that,

1460
01:23:13,451 --> 01:23:16,810
like I think a lot of animals just end
up starving because they just won't learn

1461
01:23:16,811 --> 01:23:19,660
to eat an animal that's not,
you know,

1462
01:23:20,030 --> 01:23:24,170
they're normally used to catching in some
way. So you can't fake their enclosure.

1463
01:23:24,190 --> 01:23:27,340
They can't,
they can't embrace that much of a change.

1464
01:23:27,430 --> 01:23:28,510
Well, also the, the,

1465
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:33,560
the reality of zoo life is completely
alien to the reality of an animal existing

1466
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:38,170
in an ecosphere. Yeah. Or in an ecosystem.

1467
01:23:38,290 --> 01:23:40,450
So when an animal is in a zoo,

1468
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:45,430
that animal is separated from every
other species, which never happened.

1469
01:23:45,470 --> 01:23:48,940
No, no. Absolutely. Just so
bizarre. And not only that,

1470
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:51,970
there's nothing trying to kill them.
So they don't learn anything. No.

1471
01:23:51,971 --> 01:23:55,510
All of their natural
instincts to avoid predators,

1472
01:23:55,570 --> 01:23:59,860
to sorta like sit there. They don't,
they don't experience predators.

1473
01:23:59,861 --> 01:24:04,680
Every monkey experiences.
Predators, every ape experiences,

1474
01:24:04,690 --> 01:24:06,630
cats in the wild there.

1475
01:24:06,650 --> 01:24:10,390
There's no apes that live anywhere where
there's not something that my fuck them

1476
01:24:10,391 --> 01:24:13,930
up, whether it's a spider or a snake
that they should avoid or something,

1477
01:24:14,140 --> 01:24:16,870
and they have to learn. You learn to
keep away from that snake. That's Nigga,

1478
01:24:16,871 --> 01:24:19,540
fuck you. Yeah, but that's what keeps
them sharp. Exactly what I mean.

1479
01:24:19,541 --> 01:24:21,340
That's what gives them
their lives purpose really.

1480
01:24:21,341 --> 01:24:22,870
Even if it's just surviving well,

1481
01:24:22,871 --> 01:24:27,160
it makes sure that the good
genes pass on and in the zoo,

1482
01:24:27,161 --> 01:24:31,480
it's just dumb monkeys walking each other.
No one learns anything.

1483
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:34,330
They give free peanuts,
just they just,

1484
01:24:34,390 --> 01:24:38,800
that's what they're breeding and
weirdest form of like animal prison ever.

1485
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:40,720
It's very strange.

1486
01:24:40,870 --> 01:24:44,110
No. Yeah, I mean I agree,
but again, you got kids.

1487
01:24:44,770 --> 01:24:47,290
I mean you do all sorts of
weird things for your kids.

1488
01:24:47,291 --> 01:24:48,670
I think sometimes zoos exist,

1489
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:52,480
but for the benevolence of of
kids or the needs of kids so that,

1490
01:24:52,481 --> 01:24:56,350
so that parents feel like,
well shit, you're not going
to see this any other way.

1491
01:24:56,890 --> 01:25:00,030
I love you. I want you to see them.
I'll gloss over. I'll say, oh,

1492
01:25:00,050 --> 01:25:02,770
look at the happy monkeys.
Even though in some part of you knows,

1493
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:06,520
these are not happy monkeys, the, this
is not natural either. But you know,

1494
01:25:06,521 --> 01:25:10,980
you're not going to take them to Borneo
either. A natural monkeys. Yeah, exactly.

1495
01:25:11,020 --> 01:25:14,820
Monkeys, you'll steal your
name. I will eat your kid. Um,

1496
01:25:14,890 --> 01:25:17,560
there's been stories of chimps
stealing babies that's, oh,

1497
01:25:17,561 --> 01:25:21,160
there was an awful article in
Esquire where these two, you know,

1498
01:25:21,990 --> 01:25:26,920
two people couldn't, couldn't have kids,
so they, they get, get a chimp, you know,

1499
01:25:26,921 --> 01:25:27,754
and the chimp,

1500
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:31,970
they raise the chimp like it's their kid
and then they have probably had the gym

1501
01:25:31,971 --> 01:25:36,760
for like 20 years. One day the chimp
goes nuts, tears her face off, basically.

1502
01:25:37,060 --> 01:25:39,310
Like chimps are incredibly strong,

1503
01:25:39,311 --> 01:25:43,720
powerful creatures and
um, you know, basically,

1504
01:25:44,390 --> 01:25:47,590
you mean she survived, but just
barely sort of a thing. Um,

1505
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:49,420
and you don't recognize that,
those sort of things.

1506
01:25:49,421 --> 01:25:52,460
I think when I think of chimps, I think
of that movie with Clint Eastwood. Uh,

1507
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:54,420
what every which way we're an orangutan,
but,

1508
01:25:54,610 --> 01:25:57,010
and those are probably even even
tougher, you know? I mean, they're,

1509
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:59,980
they're bigger creatures, but they're
less violent though. Are they?

1510
01:26:00,010 --> 01:26:04,130
They're more subdued sort of a thing.
Well, they'll still fuck you up. Don't dot

1511
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:05,270
your i's and crossing the t's,

1512
01:26:05,890 --> 01:26:10,820
but they don't actively seek out
fucking up other animals. Chimps.

1513
01:26:10,821 --> 01:26:15,290
Do chips have an instinct to go out
and kill things? Sure. Yeah. Chimps.

1514
01:26:15,620 --> 01:26:17,850
Chimps are not, um,
they're not herb before us.

1515
01:26:18,110 --> 01:26:20,120
Like a lot of people
have this misconception.

1516
01:26:20,460 --> 01:26:24,080
I had that up until this very
moment. Predators, they eat monkeys,

1517
01:26:24,220 --> 01:26:27,080
the monkeys alive. Oh,
Jesus. Never seen that.

1518
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:29,510
Never too dark.

1519
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:33,020
That would be dark because they didn't
heating a little version of themselves.

1520
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:36,860
Basically. God, well, they cannibalize
as well. Oh, do they really?

1521
01:26:37,220 --> 01:26:40,220
They murder other chimps and
they cannibalize other chimps.

1522
01:26:40,221 --> 01:26:41,780
They cannibalized chimp babies.

1523
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:46,420
I got chimps are the worst
aspects of human beings, um,

1524
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:50,140
like in an animal form with
intelligence and the I,

1525
01:26:50,150 --> 01:26:52,790
but I think that is what makes people
want to adopt them because it's the

1526
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:55,790
closest thing to us. That's
not us. You know what I mean?

1527
01:26:55,900 --> 01:26:59,780
What's weird is that bonobos are close
cousins and they don't exhibit any of

1528
01:26:59,781 --> 01:27:03,920
that behavior. But what they do is they
fuck each other like crazy. Oh, really?

1529
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:08,840
Everybody fucks. They fuck everybody.
The father's fuck the daughters,

1530
01:27:08,841 --> 01:27:13,730
the brothers fuck there. The, there are
other brother. They fucked their sons.

1531
01:27:13,940 --> 01:27:17,900
Everybody fucks. Really, it just like
a big clan of, yeah, just uh, you know,

1532
01:27:17,990 --> 01:27:19,880
sort of incest all over the,
well,

1533
01:27:19,890 --> 01:27:22,310
so much so that it's kind
of clever on their part.

1534
01:27:22,311 --> 01:27:24,260
They've avoided captivity because of it,

1535
01:27:24,710 --> 01:27:27,380
because you can't have them in the
zoo because they just fun. Right.

1536
01:27:27,710 --> 01:27:32,150
People are like, we can't show our kids
is fucking apes. Yeah. Go and go on.

1537
01:27:32,151 --> 01:27:36,470
Add it all the time. Which is so weird.
It's so ironic that you can, you know,

1538
01:27:36,471 --> 01:27:39,620
you can have these animals doing
everything in the wild except breeding.

1539
01:27:39,620 --> 01:27:43,660
We can't tolerate that show. Our
children breeding. Yeah, exactly.

1540
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:46,190
They only have the like the hand
as they want that or what does it,

1541
01:27:46,191 --> 01:27:50,420
there's one group that they desperate to
find them to hand as they're trying to

1542
01:27:50,780 --> 01:27:51,613
get them to breed.

1543
01:27:51,710 --> 01:27:55,910
The only thing that they do do avoid is
the mothers will not have sex with their

1544
01:27:55,911 --> 01:27:59,220
sons. That's the only one
where it's verboten. Yeah,

1545
01:27:59,250 --> 01:28:01,670
the Banabos have that one
rule for whatever reason.

1546
01:28:01,671 --> 01:28:04,070
The mother does not want to have
sex with her son and that's it.

1547
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:05,300
But everything else is fair game.

1548
01:28:05,310 --> 01:28:09,110
Everything else on the table and you won't
ever see that in the zoo because they

1549
01:28:09,111 --> 01:28:11,990
just are like, you guys just exist
in the wild where we're okay,

1550
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:16,220
we're okay with our chimps and are
gorillas and resolve conflict by fucking,

1551
01:28:17,030 --> 01:28:17,670
yeah,

1552
01:28:17,670 --> 01:28:21,980
so like sort of a prime like sort of
like that's how they express dominance.

1553
01:28:21,980 --> 01:28:26,150
Kind of an idea that way. Or even like,
I'm sure we argued here, but let's have,

1554
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:28,850
let's fuck around heroin. Everything's
all right. You don't know.

1555
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:31,790
I mean I would probably have
to study it a lot, but they do.

1556
01:28:31,791 --> 01:28:35,750
Do a lot of chimp like things where
they pick up branches and smack branches

1557
01:28:35,751 --> 01:28:39,740
around and they'll pick up a large branch
and they drag it on the ground to show

1558
01:28:39,741 --> 01:28:41,660
dominance.
Chimps do a lot of that.

1559
01:28:41,661 --> 01:28:45,500
They do a lot of posturing with
picking up large things, shaking trees.

1560
01:28:45,501 --> 01:28:48,770
I'll shake things to show how
strong they are. But chimps,

1561
01:28:48,771 --> 01:28:53,750
we'll engage in like some serious
violence. I was elbows. Yeah.

1562
01:28:53,751 --> 01:28:57,710
Well maybe if you want to, I mean, I
guess if you were into adopting it,

1563
01:28:58,070 --> 01:29:01,440
the one part of that story,
like you understand like
you have kids, but you know,

1564
01:29:01,441 --> 01:29:02,040
I have kids.

1565
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:04,560
I think if you don't have kids
and you've tried to have kids,

1566
01:29:04,561 --> 01:29:08,580
I think people might feel that there's
a loss in their life and something that

1567
01:29:08,581 --> 01:29:11,200
needs to be filled. You know, and
often you fill it with an animal,

1568
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:15,300
you get really into dog
breeding or [inaudible] 17
cats or something like that.

1569
01:29:15,301 --> 01:29:17,280
These guys decided to,
chimp was the way to go.

1570
01:29:17,281 --> 01:29:22,170
And I guess I would have
thought like totally innocently
that, yeah, okay. A chimp,

1571
01:29:22,171 --> 01:29:26,040
whatever. You dress it up in a Tuxedo.
And, uh, do whatever. It's a little weird,

1572
01:29:26,041 --> 01:29:28,830
but I get the,
I get why you're doing it.

1573
01:29:28,860 --> 01:29:31,410
I know it's a replacement for the
fact that you can't have kids,

1574
01:29:31,411 --> 01:29:35,070
but then when this kid goes
a feral on you basically and,

1575
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:36,850
and attacks you in a way that,
um,

1576
01:29:37,860 --> 01:29:41,280
documentary about people
that keep scary animals.

1577
01:29:41,281 --> 01:29:45,060
It's called the elephant in the living
room and it's supposed to be really good.

1578
01:29:45,061 --> 01:29:48,330
I got an 82% on rotten tomatoes.
I need to watch it,

1579
01:29:48,570 --> 01:29:52,950
but it's a documentary about the
raising of exotic pets in homes and, uh,

1580
01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:57,870
how many knuckleheads in America wind up
doing that? They, you know, they have,

1581
01:29:58,050 --> 01:29:59,220
like,
there was this thing the other day,

1582
01:29:59,221 --> 01:30:02,550
I was watching this piece on this
guy who has a pet mountain line,

1583
01:30:02,850 --> 01:30:05,100
really bottle fed it since it was a baby.

1584
01:30:05,230 --> 01:30:09,170
And you see at least in a sort of a
remote area or, I don't know. I don't,

1585
01:30:09,420 --> 01:30:12,450
I didn't pay attention off,
but he's got this cat,

1586
01:30:12,451 --> 01:30:16,140
he's had it since it was a baby and now
it's a full grown 200 pound female cat

1587
01:30:16,141 --> 01:30:18,720
and just like, yeah, okay. Yeah.

1588
01:30:19,150 --> 01:30:22,620
Hope that works out. Thank
you. Are Juggling dynamite
right here, my friend. But uh,

1589
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:27,370
nappy, you know, I mean I don't know
what I'm, some animals are cool with it,

1590
01:30:27,430 --> 01:30:30,220
you know, as long as you feed them
and your sweet with them. But yeah,

1591
01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:33,610
the bottom line is it's always going
to have that instinct to chase shit.

1592
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:37,840
If you roll a ball of yarn in front of
a take a ball of yarn and toss it in

1593
01:30:37,841 --> 01:30:39,640
front of a house cat, they
fucking dive on that. Yeah,

1594
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:43,980
yeah. Oh yeah. Total open. No, no, exactly
like a laser pointer on the wall there.

1595
01:30:43,981 --> 01:30:46,680
But yeah, there are bananas. You
can't, that's their instinct, you know.

1596
01:30:46,681 --> 01:30:50,860
So and we have one who comes home
with all manner of like cats are,

1597
01:30:50,861 --> 01:30:54,600
you can't beat cats for like Sorta,
just like sadism. Oh, they've worked.

1598
01:30:54,601 --> 01:30:57,390
Came home once. It was night and I was
like, what do you got there in your mouth?

1599
01:30:57,391 --> 01:31:00,000
And she opens her mouth and
it was a baby mouse alive.

1600
01:31:00,390 --> 01:31:04,110
She just cradled it in her mouth like,
but I realized if I'd come five,

1601
01:31:04,170 --> 01:31:08,570
she was just going to play with it until
it either died of fright or punctual.

1602
01:31:08,670 --> 01:31:11,970
Yeah. She chewed it up
basically. So I think like a dog,

1603
01:31:12,360 --> 01:31:15,630
a dog just goes and gets what it wants.
Eats it. Most animals do. But man,

1604
01:31:15,631 --> 01:31:17,820
a house cat especially cause they're,
all their needs are covered.

1605
01:31:17,821 --> 01:31:20,140
So it's like this is all just fun for me.
My cat

1606
01:31:20,260 --> 01:31:24,320
grew up a mouse once. Ah,
he had eaten it and uh,

1607
01:31:24,430 --> 01:31:28,690
then just puked it in the living room.
Yeah, that's rough. She, yeah. Yeah.

1608
01:31:28,691 --> 01:31:32,080
Ours or ours or girls instead of a male
cat too. But it wasn't a male cat that,

1609
01:31:32,081 --> 01:31:36,760
that it was a female. She just
barfed it up. Little mini mouse.

1610
01:31:36,850 --> 01:31:41,690
Oh that's terrible. Cat Food.
Narrow. Hairballs yeah. I'm like,

1611
01:31:41,770 --> 01:31:46,280
oh you discussed monster fucking weird
because they're looking at you like the

1612
01:31:46,290 --> 01:31:49,090
parent and everything. I was rubbing
up against you. Like they're so sweet.

1613
01:31:49,150 --> 01:31:52,630
But you think, man, if I was an inch
tall, you would make sport out of me.

1614
01:31:52,631 --> 01:31:55,060
You would make mince meat out
of me and you would have no,

1615
01:31:55,090 --> 01:31:56,560
not a goddamn care in the world.

1616
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:59,810
No. No, no remorse. No,
no remorse. All it was,

1617
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:03,530
I enjoy reading, reading. Uh,

1618
01:32:03,900 --> 01:32:08,900
it's just cut into this last week a
reading Vegan forums on how to feed their

1619
01:32:10,091 --> 01:32:15,091
cats and they almost all reluctantly have
to admit that their cats need meat is

1620
01:32:16,540 --> 01:32:20,770
CATSA very high protein requirements and
much different than a human beings and

1621
01:32:20,771 --> 01:32:22,710
much different even than a dog.
He can,

1622
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:26,680
you can feed dogs like a certain amount
of Vegan food and, and the vegans,

1623
01:32:26,681 --> 01:32:27,600
do they say

1624
01:32:27,820 --> 01:32:30,310
we're, we're, this is a
Vegan, Vegan household and it,

1625
01:32:30,311 --> 01:32:32,460
that counts on our dogs and cats as well.

1626
01:32:32,570 --> 01:32:35,570
Do what? Their dogs. Wow. People
get away with it with their dogs.

1627
01:32:35,571 --> 01:32:36,750
They don't get away with it.
The cat.

1628
01:32:36,910 --> 01:32:38,950
Yeah. That's just, there
just wouldn't be healthy.

1629
01:32:39,710 --> 01:32:42,070
You'd like mistreatment
animals like this all day.

1630
01:32:44,790 --> 01:32:45,623
I need some time,

1631
01:32:47,430 --> 01:32:50,560
but this mangy looking for
fallen out and oh, he's fine.

1632
01:32:50,561 --> 01:32:52,570
He's just kind of going through a stage,

1633
01:32:52,650 --> 01:32:53,670
just reading the,

1634
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:57,800
the torment that these people have gone
through before they make the decision to

1635
01:32:57,801 --> 01:32:58,520
feed.

1636
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:02,220
Yeah, I know, I can imagine.
I can only imagine, you know,

1637
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:07,320
I had one to Iot, I was trying to do
a, an article on, um, on pit bulls,

1638
01:33:07,690 --> 01:33:09,370
which I thought would've been
really interesting cause I,

1639
01:33:09,371 --> 01:33:11,620
one thing I noticed it
in research was like,

1640
01:33:12,010 --> 01:33:16,150
people in different parts of this country
breed pit bulls differently based on

1641
01:33:16,300 --> 01:33:20,290
where they are from. Like Kentucky,
Arkansas, they breed like a really lean,

1642
01:33:21,190 --> 01:33:24,860
it's almost like fighters, like a really
lean fast version of a dog. Whereas in,

1643
01:33:24,861 --> 01:33:29,340
in California, uh, or sorry, Florida
and Miami area, they be your breed,

1644
01:33:29,341 --> 01:33:30,280
like really big,

1645
01:33:30,610 --> 01:33:34,210
bulky kind of that sort of what the
genes that they want to put together and

1646
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:39,220
yeah, for the purposes of, of fighting
these creatures. Um, and I mean I,

1647
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:43,900
I, I like pit bulls. I've
met, I've met not, you know,
nice pit bulls, you know. Um,

1648
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:46,720
but I do,
I do know from what I've researched,

1649
01:33:46,721 --> 01:33:48,790
any ways that they're like bred into,

1650
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:52,180
they're built to be fighting creatures
that sort of what they were bred for it.

1651
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:55,150
Um, and not sort of what that's
exactly what they were bred for.

1652
01:33:55,151 --> 01:33:59,110
And so that sort of thing is always
in there is, is in their DNA helix.

1653
01:33:59,111 --> 01:34:01,960
It's sort of, it's sunk
in there and uh, you know,

1654
01:34:01,961 --> 01:34:05,110
you go onto these pitbull forums and
you experience in the same way with Veg,

1655
01:34:05,190 --> 01:34:09,400
like a very strong emotional kind of like,
you don't understand, you don't get it.

1656
01:34:09,401 --> 01:34:13,690
And I wasn't even coming from a
perspective of like intolerance or hatred.

1657
01:34:13,691 --> 01:34:15,490
I was just coming from a
perspective of I just want it,

1658
01:34:15,491 --> 01:34:16,540
would like to talk about it.

1659
01:34:16,541 --> 01:34:19,840
Where do you go to a pit bull fighting
forum and what wasn't fighting.

1660
01:34:19,841 --> 01:34:22,510
This was what they do
with this one was um,

1661
01:34:22,570 --> 01:34:25,510
they in sort of like
tracked your pulse for dogs.

1662
01:34:25,900 --> 01:34:28,420
Oh they hook them up to
sledges and they see how much,

1663
01:34:28,421 --> 01:34:31,300
how many bricks they can carry
and, and that sort of like, I mean,

1664
01:34:31,301 --> 01:34:35,290
I'd much rather that, right. Just like
strength events basically for these dogs.

1665
01:34:35,291 --> 01:34:39,910
But I, I, I, I sort of had the
temerity I guess to, to say, you know,

1666
01:34:39,940 --> 01:34:42,040
you guys,
I hope I can see why you're doing this.

1667
01:34:42,041 --> 01:34:44,590
You're sort of doing this because these
dogs have these instincts and it's

1668
01:34:44,591 --> 01:34:48,580
better to have them pulling a
sledge then fighting, you know,

1669
01:34:48,581 --> 01:34:51,960
fighting one another or fighting
other dogs and you know, you're,

1670
01:34:51,961 --> 01:34:54,310
you're just sort of assaulted
by these people who are like,

1671
01:34:54,311 --> 01:34:58,010
you don't get it at all. These are the
nicest creatures ever. And I wasn't

1672
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:01,820
even coming from saying there. They're
not nice creatures. You know, I, I, again,

1673
01:35:01,821 --> 01:35:04,580
I feel like a lot of it with
animal ownership is the owner.

1674
01:35:04,610 --> 01:35:06,710
It's really not the dog always,
you know,

1675
01:35:06,711 --> 01:35:09,710
a dog when it's born can go
any number of different ways.

1676
01:35:10,010 --> 01:35:13,820
But when you see a a pit bull owned by
a guy who's driving around like a jacked

1677
01:35:13,821 --> 01:35:17,390
up pickup truck and his dog's got like
a spike collar on and he's carrying

1678
01:35:17,391 --> 01:35:20,270
around by a links of know chain,
you're like,

1679
01:35:20,420 --> 01:35:24,190
that dog might potentially have been
raised with a certain higher you.

1680
01:35:24,770 --> 01:35:28,040
The aggression might've been brought out
of a more than this dog that had grown

1681
01:35:28,041 --> 01:35:31,730
up with the family with three kids in it,
you know? Yeah, they can be good pets,

1682
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:34,100
but they're always dangerous.
Run other dogs. Always.

1683
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:37,940
Almost always very rare that you get
a pit bull that doesn't have animal

1684
01:35:37,941 --> 01:35:41,120
aggression.
Just thousands of years of genetics.

1685
01:35:41,450 --> 01:35:44,300
They're raised them to be
aggressive and to fight other dogs.

1686
01:35:44,301 --> 01:35:45,920
I love pit bulls as pets,

1687
01:35:45,950 --> 01:35:49,550
but I won't have them
just because it's a drag.

1688
01:35:49,860 --> 01:35:54,110
Like your friend brings their dog over
and your dogs don't play. They go to war,

1689
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:57,860
you know? Exactly. It's not exactly
if it's two pimples, it's one thing.

1690
01:35:57,861 --> 01:36:01,370
But if your friend brings over his
black lab at ain't it ain't a fight.

1691
01:36:02,300 --> 01:36:03,980
Not a fight. And I went, I did a,

1692
01:36:03,981 --> 01:36:07,280
went into the SPCA and they just busted
a ring and they had like 40 fighting

1693
01:36:07,281 --> 01:36:10,970
dogs and they were so nice
around the Spca workers, all the,

1694
01:36:11,180 --> 01:36:13,280
but they end up having to,
to destroy.

1695
01:36:13,281 --> 01:36:17,960
Most of them were maybe all of them even
because it's, it is, it's like having a,

1696
01:36:18,610 --> 01:36:19,220
uh,

1697
01:36:19,220 --> 01:36:22,740
a stick of dynamite with a
fuse of indeterminate link
that could blow up at any

1698
01:36:22,741 --> 01:36:23,810
time,
you know,

1699
01:36:23,811 --> 01:36:27,350
and they just felt like you had been
bred to this sort of utility and this is

1700
01:36:27,351 --> 01:36:30,260
what you're good for and it's
not your fault, but you're just,

1701
01:36:30,261 --> 01:36:32,950
you're not safe out in general population.
And also,

1702
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:34,240
if they're not trained properly,

1703
01:36:34,250 --> 01:36:37,090
can be very dangerous around children
because they don't recognize children's

1704
01:36:37,100 --> 01:36:38,310
adults.
Uh,

1705
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:42,290
well they'll acquiesce to an
adult's demands and requests.

1706
01:36:42,291 --> 01:36:45,590
They look at adults as being
the ones that are in control.

1707
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:48,860
They don't look at children along
those same lines. They see something,

1708
01:36:48,861 --> 01:36:53,240
their height and they just attack it. Ah,
that's fucking really, Dang. It is. It is.

1709
01:36:53,241 --> 01:36:56,190
And, and I mean, again, there's going
to be people listening to this who are,

1710
01:36:56,200 --> 01:36:59,570
or Pippo fanciers and they're going to,
I've had a bunch of them. Have you? Yeah.

1711
01:36:59,600 --> 01:36:59,901
Who have,

1712
01:36:59,901 --> 01:37:03,980
who have had half had words about this
or have they know I've had pit bulls,

1713
01:37:04,420 --> 01:37:09,110
pit bulls yourself. I came home once. My
dog had killed my dog in the living room.

1714
01:37:09,140 --> 01:37:13,580
You're kidding. No, they went
to war when I was gone. Jesus,

1715
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:17,960
believe me, man. I'm, I'm, I love them as
animals. I will never have them as pets.

1716
01:37:17,990 --> 01:37:21,360
Not Anymore. Yeah. So you've got kids
now too. Of course. I didn't have kids.

1717
01:37:21,380 --> 01:37:25,640
I just deal with it, get it out and
attack the neighbor's dog or something.

1718
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:29,630
That happened to my dogs.
Dad got out of his yard,

1719
01:37:29,631 --> 01:37:30,890
crawled into the neighbor's yard,

1720
01:37:30,891 --> 01:37:34,400
attack the neighbor's dog and the animal
control guys came over and killed it.

1721
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:38,540
It's fucked. It's like, first of all,
it's fucked for the neighbor. You know,

1722
01:37:38,541 --> 01:37:42,050
the dog's barking. Like dogs bark at each
other and they're thinking, you know,

1723
01:37:42,270 --> 01:37:45,020
Shit. Dogs like, oh, for real,

1724
01:37:47,480 --> 01:37:50,750
fighting to the death of the, I'm
already in your yard. It is to the death.

1725
01:37:50,751 --> 01:37:55,230
That's the only way I know you with
the guy in the basketball. You're like,

1726
01:37:55,290 --> 01:37:58,140
Holy Shit, I'm, I'm up against
the different breed of humanity.

1727
01:37:58,141 --> 01:38:00,660
Right guys kicking me in the
head. Yeah. Nowhere. And you know,

1728
01:38:00,661 --> 01:38:03,750
you're just trying to play basketball and
your brother's rubbing your shoulders.

1729
01:38:03,751 --> 01:38:05,210
Neither one of you know,
what the fuck are you doing?

1730
01:38:05,211 --> 01:38:08,280
How are totally neophytes and, and you
know, and there was something, you know,

1731
01:38:08,281 --> 01:38:10,800
this is probably way too like writerly,

1732
01:38:11,130 --> 01:38:14,340
but there is something about the eyes
of a guy like that and you're just like,

1733
01:38:14,370 --> 01:38:18,890
oh, I'm, you know, you know, you're
done before you're done. I haven't, no,

1734
01:38:18,930 --> 01:38:21,270
you're done before. Hundreds
of those dudes. Yeah.

1735
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:24,000
There's just something clockwork
in around in their eyes like,

1736
01:38:24,001 --> 01:38:27,720
and you're just like, oh no, no, no,
I'm not, I'm not built to this standard.

1737
01:38:27,721 --> 01:38:29,850
This is not going to work
out too well for me. Yeah.

1738
01:38:29,851 --> 01:38:32,640
There's guys that enjoy beating the
fuck out of people. And like I said,

1739
01:38:32,641 --> 01:38:35,790
a lot of them have had the fuck
beaten out of them and it becomes,

1740
01:38:36,050 --> 01:38:39,270
and that's one of the things that they
say that's the most horrific thing about

1741
01:38:39,271 --> 01:38:40,110
sexual abuse,

1742
01:38:40,111 --> 01:38:45,010
is that a lot of the abused become
abusers when they get older. Exactly.

1743
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:47,490
It started like a repetitive of the sun.

1744
01:38:48,030 --> 01:38:50,670
Ray expresses the sins
of the father so dark.

1745
01:38:50,730 --> 01:38:53,940
It's such a weird thing how it makes
you realize too. Just how fortunate.

1746
01:38:53,941 --> 01:38:55,050
Like I again,
I know you,

1747
01:38:55,410 --> 01:38:58,370
you spoke about your mom and you have
a good relationship with your mom.

1748
01:38:58,371 --> 01:39:02,130
I did a good relationship with your
father as well. No, no. Terrible. Oh,

1749
01:39:02,131 --> 01:39:05,340
I don't know him.
He was a horrible guy.

1750
01:39:05,790 --> 01:39:09,000
But my experience up until
I was five years old,

1751
01:39:09,001 --> 01:39:12,910
it was just him being really violent
and scary to, to both you and your mom.

1752
01:39:12,930 --> 01:39:15,890
Mostly to my mother. Not
really to me, but uh,

1753
01:39:15,940 --> 01:39:20,290
enough so that it was just a
scary thing to watch. Yeah.
Well, so, you know, I mean,

1754
01:39:20,310 --> 01:39:22,170
I would just very
fortunate you realize how

1755
01:39:22,710 --> 01:39:26,910
luck is based on so many things that
just who your parents are, where,

1756
01:39:26,911 --> 01:39:31,380
where you're born in the world.
And uh, um, and uh, yeah, I didn't,

1757
01:39:31,470 --> 01:39:34,730
I've been very fortunate that way, but
I know friends who have had, you know,

1758
01:39:34,740 --> 01:39:38,460
different situations so,
but anyways, yeah, yeah.

1759
01:39:38,550 --> 01:39:40,500
I mean it's just

1760
01:39:41,590 --> 01:39:45,510
get your hand in life.
You do what with with it what you can,

1761
01:39:45,511 --> 01:39:50,190
but some people's hand is
just unmanageable and that
is just the reality of

1762
01:39:50,191 --> 01:39:51,030
being a human being.

1763
01:39:51,031 --> 01:39:54,900
There are certain people that are just
abused to the point of no return before

1764
01:39:55,320 --> 01:39:57,330
they ever get a chance to
try to sort their life out.

1765
01:39:57,660 --> 01:40:02,340
I wouldn't even begin to know how to
manage that. I wouldn't know what to do.

1766
01:40:02,370 --> 01:40:07,200
And I know people that have, uh,
adopted, uh, abused kids and you know,

1767
01:40:07,201 --> 01:40:08,034
the kid is,

1768
01:40:08,190 --> 01:40:11,640
they've had the kids since the kid
was three and then the kids now a in

1769
01:40:11,641 --> 01:40:16,620
kindergarten and fucked the gets fucked.
No. In My, uh, my, my wife is out,

1770
01:40:17,020 --> 01:40:21,420
the child services social worker,
which I mean, it's tough. It's tough.

1771
01:40:21,421 --> 01:40:25,500
And she told me this one
story, I can repeat it. Um,

1772
01:40:26,190 --> 01:40:29,470
and she, she goes over
with this, this other, uh,

1773
01:40:29,490 --> 01:40:33,420
with a cop actually to apprehend
these kids, opens the door, dirt bag.

1774
01:40:33,421 --> 01:40:37,300
Father answers it. My kids aren't here,
kids haven't been here for days. Uh,

1775
01:40:37,380 --> 01:40:39,620
she's like, well, we
have reports that your,

1776
01:40:39,630 --> 01:40:43,500
your wife said that they are here because
they're certainly not with your, your,

1777
01:40:43,501 --> 01:40:47,010
your ex. And you know, basically
they had a warrant. They got inside

1778
01:40:48,750 --> 01:40:52,830
rooms, empty apartments, empty as far as
they could tell. Closets, open closets,

1779
01:40:52,870 --> 01:40:53,800
open a jar.

1780
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:56,680
So they open it up to kids in there,
in the closet.

1781
01:40:57,040 --> 01:41:00,850
And the one thing that my wife
noticed was it the wallpaper,

1782
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,250
I don't know who wallpapers the
inside of closet, but whatever,

1783
01:41:03,370 --> 01:41:07,120
it was ripped and rags and the kids had
been eating anything because they had

1784
01:41:07,121 --> 01:41:08,620
been in there for so long that,

1785
01:41:10,310 --> 01:41:12,570
that, that was sort of how
it, how it came that way.

1786
01:41:12,571 --> 01:41:14,690
They got to the point where they were,
or they were eating the wall

1787
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:18,440
paper listening to this podcast recently,

1788
01:41:18,441 --> 01:41:22,520
that there's this podcast that I
really enjoy called radio lab. And uh,

1789
01:41:22,620 --> 01:41:26,020
one of the episodes or radio lab
dealt with this guy. Um, the,

1790
01:41:26,030 --> 01:41:28,110
the episode's called escape, uh, dealt,

1791
01:41:28,170 --> 01:41:32,130
dealt with this guy who had spent
his entire life in and out of jail.

1792
01:41:32,910 --> 01:41:35,310
And it was about his,
uh,

1793
01:41:35,311 --> 01:41:39,840
his childhood and how he was sort
of abandoned. He was raised by,

1794
01:41:40,500 --> 01:41:44,070
I forget what relative, but they didn't
feed them. And so him and his dog,

1795
01:41:44,100 --> 01:41:48,450
his sister would eat paper at night
just to fill their stomachs because they

1796
01:41:48,451 --> 01:41:52,140
were an agony from hunger pains.
Yeah, yeah. Do you know you,

1797
01:41:52,141 --> 01:41:54,420
you read about shit like that and this,
you know,

1798
01:41:54,421 --> 01:41:59,421
this guy goes on this horrific cycle of
childhood abuse and becomes as criminal

1799
01:42:00,241 --> 01:42:01,074
and,

1800
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:05,760
and he wound up meeting this woman falling
in love and actually having a family

1801
01:42:05,761 --> 01:42:09,390
but still keeps fucking up and
can't figure out a way to stop.

1802
01:42:09,391 --> 01:42:13,170
And you hear it from the woman, you
know, like the woman who married him.

1803
01:42:13,171 --> 01:42:15,780
Her point of view of like
what could he do? Look,

1804
01:42:15,781 --> 01:42:20,160
I grew up like in this horrific
state and he just, he's broken.

1805
01:42:20,190 --> 01:42:22,650
He's a broken man.
It's fucked.

1806
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:23,391
And it's,
yeah.

1807
01:42:23,391 --> 01:42:26,990
It's like before we even had a chance
really to make his own decision about some

1808
01:42:26,991 --> 01:42:31,070
of these things. Um, yeah. Yeah. I know.

1809
01:42:31,071 --> 01:42:34,730
I don't mean to be a Downer about
any of this. Yeah. Yeah. As a writer.

1810
01:42:34,731 --> 01:42:38,010
I that what I was gonna ask earlier,
okay.

1811
01:42:38,060 --> 01:42:41,030
About watching things that you,
you know,

1812
01:42:41,060 --> 01:42:43,700
watching humans that you don't
agree with or watching things,

1813
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:49,370
studying human behavior.
When you do that,

1814
01:42:49,371 --> 01:42:54,371
do you try to put yourself in the mind
of the abused or the mind of the abuser?

1815
01:42:55,131 --> 01:42:55,341
Like,

1816
01:42:55,341 --> 01:42:59,660
do you try to put yourself into these
people's heads to try to see what was like

1817
01:42:59,661 --> 01:43:03,990
this guy who, you know, they found him
and you know, he's saying like, no,

1818
01:43:04,020 --> 01:43:06,050
my kids aren't here.
And then they find the kids in the closet.

1819
01:43:06,051 --> 01:43:07,070
Do you try to put yourself in

1820
01:43:07,230 --> 01:43:09,540
that guy's mind? No.
Eight mean in that case,

1821
01:43:09,541 --> 01:43:13,380
I put myself in the mind of the
social worker because Ma, you know,

1822
01:43:13,381 --> 01:43:15,660
it was easier to,
for me to put myself in the mind of,

1823
01:43:15,661 --> 01:43:20,250
of my wife rather than put myself in
the mind of, of someone like that.

1824
01:43:20,280 --> 01:43:21,920
You know what I mean? But
even in the troupe, there's,

1825
01:43:21,930 --> 01:43:25,320
there's a character Shelly
who is, uh, you know,

1826
01:43:25,380 --> 01:43:30,120
has some very serious things
wrong with him. Uh, and um, so,

1827
01:43:30,150 --> 01:43:30,691
so yeah,

1828
01:43:30,691 --> 01:43:34,740
I think part of it is trying to put
yourself as closely into that mindset as,

1829
01:43:34,741 --> 01:43:36,630
as you can,
um,

1830
01:43:36,720 --> 01:43:40,350
while recognizing that you can
never quite bridged that gap.

1831
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:43,710
You know what I mean?
Cause cause I mean,

1832
01:43:43,711 --> 01:43:45,870
that's just the leap that I
can't quite make, you know,

1833
01:43:45,871 --> 01:43:50,100
so you just have to hope that,
that you're getting close enough that uh,

1834
01:43:50,120 --> 01:43:52,280
that the reader is always said as,
as a writer,

1835
01:43:52,281 --> 01:43:54,020
you just need to be one
step ahead of your reader.

1836
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:56,780
It means you have to have done that a
little bit more to more research or just

1837
01:43:56,781 --> 01:43:59,240
spent more time thinking about
these things that a reader,

1838
01:43:59,241 --> 01:44:02,150
hopefully it's going to
read really quickly and it's
going to be like, okay, okay.

1839
01:44:02,151 --> 01:44:04,970
It's not, nothing is really
sticking out. That is enough.

1840
01:44:04,971 --> 01:44:06,560
That's going to make them sort of checkup,

1841
01:44:06,590 --> 01:44:10,250
which all people do in a book or a
movie. They're like, okay, you've just,

1842
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:11,990
this is too far.

1843
01:44:11,991 --> 01:44:15,380
You suddenly you've sort of cross some
sort of boundary that I'm no longer quite

1844
01:44:15,381 --> 01:44:19,460
with you in the way that I was before. Um,
and you never know what it like. I was,

1845
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:20,410
I was,
you know,

1846
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:25,340
having dinner yesterday at the hotel bar
and ended up next to this guy talking

1847
01:44:25,341 --> 01:44:30,320
to him and he was like a big Tom
Clancy reader. And, and I said,

1848
01:44:30,340 --> 01:44:34,070
Oh, I've had people, like I had a guy
get in touch with me once. Uh, cause I,

1849
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:37,550
I wrote some sort of book that had some
military stuff in it and he was sorry,

1850
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:40,700
said, well, you know, um, and not to,
not to be a nitpicker anything, but the,

1851
01:44:40,701 --> 01:44:45,200
the clip capacity of an m 16 is actually
16 rounds and not 17, as you said.

1852
01:44:45,770 --> 01:44:49,760
And I'm like, I get it. I
mean, I get it. I get that.
That's wrong. That's a mistake.

1853
01:44:49,820 --> 01:44:52,260
Um,
but I think probably the store,

1854
01:44:52,330 --> 01:44:55,160
that's what I'm trying to
do is not really having,

1855
01:44:55,220 --> 01:44:58,160
it'd be great if I could have caught
that and it was more scrupulous to fact,

1856
01:44:58,161 --> 01:45:02,330
but really you're trying to weave a
narrative and fiction, but some readers,

1857
01:45:02,570 --> 01:45:06,080
that's what they want. They want to take
this out of it. If you don't, exactly.

1858
01:45:06,081 --> 01:45:07,610
If you don't get the facts right,
if you don't,

1859
01:45:07,611 --> 01:45:10,640
if you're doing something about
medical stuff and you're not,

1860
01:45:10,700 --> 01:45:15,410
you haven't been scrupulous
about it, then, um, then yeah,
then you're going to get,

1861
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:17,360
but I mean, the guy mentioned, he's like,

1862
01:45:17,361 --> 01:45:20,510
that's why I can't read Stephen King
because he gets apparently too many things

1863
01:45:20,511 --> 01:45:21,344
wrong.
And I'm like,

1864
01:45:21,650 --> 01:45:25,760
I am so deep into most
Stephen King narratives that
I don't wonder what he gets

1865
01:45:25,761 --> 01:45:28,970
wrong. I wonder that too. I, I, I sort
of asked him and he wasn't able to,

1866
01:45:28,971 --> 01:45:30,110
he wasn't able to say anything.

1867
01:45:30,111 --> 01:45:32,780
It was just a generalized sentiment
that's not who gets things wrong.

1868
01:45:32,810 --> 01:45:37,730
There go much to be a dick, a wine.
He might've been, he was, he was,

1869
01:45:37,731 --> 01:45:39,770
uh,
he was a defense contractor.

1870
01:45:39,890 --> 01:45:42,710
He sounds like a dick if
he can't tell you the exact

1871
01:45:42,780 --> 01:45:46,560
things that Stephen King got wrong,
like any particular examples,

1872
01:45:46,561 --> 01:45:47,610
he's gotta be a dickhead.

1873
01:45:47,680 --> 01:45:48,460
Yeah.
Well,

1874
01:45:48,460 --> 01:45:51,250
and sometimes you just find yourself
faced up against so many said something

1875
01:45:51,251 --> 01:45:55,390
like, well, uh, you know, fracking, you
know, fracking. And he's like, well,

1876
01:45:55,480 --> 01:45:59,230
I've done research and there's absolutely
not a damn thing wrong with fracking.

1877
01:45:59,260 --> 01:46:03,310
And it's a myth. Just like global warming
is a myth. And I was like, oh, okay.

1878
01:46:03,311 --> 01:46:06,850
I think we're probably on different sides
of this and I'm not going to get into

1879
01:46:06,851 --> 01:46:08,050
an argument with you about it,

1880
01:46:08,051 --> 01:46:11,920
but that's where you just tune out of a
conversation. He was like, oh, okay. I'm,

1881
01:46:12,010 --> 01:46:16,690
I'm, I'm out of fracking or not a myth.
No. I mean, people are light up their,

1882
01:46:16,691 --> 01:46:18,610
their tap water. I don't know
if you're seeing that, you know,

1883
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:19,720
people have been able to

1884
01:46:19,720 --> 01:46:21,670
do that.
I've looked pretty deeply into it.

1885
01:46:21,910 --> 01:46:25,150
People have been able to light up their
tap water long before there was fracking.

1886
01:46:25,180 --> 01:46:28,990
It is possible that, well
water is getting, is getting
the, they get contaminated,

1887
01:46:29,530 --> 01:46:32,710
but the reality of contaminated,
well,

1888
01:46:32,711 --> 01:46:36,760
water's directly related to fracking
is undeniable because they're,

1889
01:46:36,761 --> 01:46:39,730
they're blown out the earth and then it's
seeping through until the end of the,

1890
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:42,130
yeah. They're all, and they're
getting better at fracking.

1891
01:46:42,131 --> 01:46:45,730
They're figuring out a way to do it
that's more efficient. But the reality is,

1892
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:46,061
you know,

1893
01:46:46,061 --> 01:46:49,070
you've got to break some eggs to make an
omelet and guys don't give a fuck. Yeah.

1894
01:46:49,340 --> 01:46:52,680
They're trying to get natural resources
out of the ground and they're not trying

1895
01:46:52,681 --> 01:46:56,490
to not pollute.
They're just doing their best to confirm,

1896
01:46:56,770 --> 01:47:00,210
to conform to whatever regulations
that get established. Yeah.

1897
01:47:00,510 --> 01:47:01,860
That allow them to make money.

1898
01:47:01,861 --> 01:47:06,861
And those regulations are directly
influenced by the very companies that make

1899
01:47:07,080 --> 01:47:10,590
fucking trillions of dollars.
They own the politicians,

1900
01:47:10,591 --> 01:47:13,350
they buy all the regulations.

1901
01:47:13,351 --> 01:47:16,860
They make sure that everything is in place
so that they can make money. Totally.

1902
01:47:17,140 --> 01:47:20,040
I mean, there's definitely some
damage that fracking has done.

1903
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:24,990
Did the question becomes, is it okay?
Is it okay that this damage is done?

1904
01:47:24,991 --> 01:47:28,240
Because there's a plus side,
there's, there are employee. Yeah.

1905
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:31,860
There's a lot of natural gases and a
lot of natural resources that we could

1906
01:47:31,861 --> 01:47:36,180
harvest. And that's different question.
Yeah. But the idea that it's a,

1907
01:47:36,300 --> 01:47:39,330
it's a myth and there's nothing wrong
with fracking. That guy's a dick.

1908
01:47:40,830 --> 01:47:41,650
Those,
those

1909
01:47:41,650 --> 01:47:43,730
fucking right wing chatterboxes.

1910
01:47:43,810 --> 01:47:46,920
Yeah. Yeah. And it just come
right out with it too. I'm,

1911
01:47:46,930 --> 01:47:49,300
but then like two minutes of
us talking, I'm like, wow,

1912
01:47:49,330 --> 01:47:52,870
now suddenly I'm not getting into this
where he's an idiot. He's an idiot.

1913
01:47:53,020 --> 01:47:56,800
The idea that global warming is a myth
too. He's an idiot. Yeah. I feel like,

1914
01:47:56,810 --> 01:48:01,010
come on. It's pretty well established
and whether or not it's human influenced.

1915
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:05,660
There's, that's a debate
that most scientists almost,

1916
01:48:05,900 --> 01:48:07,310
I think it's some insane number,

1917
01:48:07,340 --> 01:48:11,610
like 99% think that it's human
influence and since he's not okay

1918
01:48:11,670 --> 01:48:15,590
fucking science,
maybe you should shut is dirty hall.

1919
01:48:16,470 --> 01:48:20,360
Yeah. And I feel, I felt almost
like a fuck, I hate to say Joe,

1920
01:48:20,370 --> 01:48:22,860
but like a bit of a fraud that I
didn't go up against them, you know,

1921
01:48:22,861 --> 01:48:25,890
because you're like, I would've walked
away. Yeah. You can't fight every battle.

1922
01:48:25,891 --> 01:48:26,970
But there's a sense of like,

1923
01:48:26,971 --> 01:48:29,490
cause that's the conservative
thing is like to come right at you.

1924
01:48:29,491 --> 01:48:33,330
And I feel like, well fuck if I don't,
if I don't come back and say something,

1925
01:48:33,331 --> 01:48:36,360
I've started just like let him believe
that his point is valid for the

1926
01:48:36,390 --> 01:48:37,223
perspective.

1927
01:48:37,230 --> 01:48:39,100
Nadian you're a liberal,
you wear glasses.

1928
01:48:39,180 --> 01:48:41,860
I know fucking hates you or I,
it was amazing.

1929
01:48:41,870 --> 01:48:46,330
Even spoke to me in the first place and
we spoke to you to correct you. Correct.

1930
01:48:46,331 --> 01:48:50,230
You and Stephen King and he's fucking
pussies are scared of fracking.

1931
01:48:51,040 --> 01:48:54,700
You're worried about global warming.
I'm going to buy land up in your country.

1932
01:48:55,960 --> 01:48:56,793
Meanwhile,

1933
01:48:56,820 --> 01:48:59,050
you know,
they don't understand that global warning.

1934
01:48:59,110 --> 01:49:02,530
It changes both the
cold and the warm though

1935
01:49:02,580 --> 01:49:06,260
cold gets colder. Yeah. That's one of
the big arguments is like, well look at,

1936
01:49:06,270 --> 01:49:09,330
look at w you know, you'd look at how
cold it is now. We had a hell of a winter.

1937
01:49:09,331 --> 01:49:12,180
Then understand it's like you don't,
it's the fluctuations that are,

1938
01:49:12,181 --> 01:49:15,540
what are the things you are
need to be looking at, you
know? But whatever. It's a,

1939
01:49:15,630 --> 01:49:17,760
it's a worthless sort of
thing to get into. You know,

1940
01:49:17,761 --> 01:49:21,060
especially with this guy had to be
like Donald Sterling's age. It ain't,

1941
01:49:22,050 --> 01:49:24,780
it ain't worth fighting. It Ain't
worth it. He's an old that point.

1942
01:49:25,230 --> 01:49:27,330
You should have scared him and see
if he'd give him a heart. Right.

1943
01:49:28,340 --> 01:49:30,880
Sorry.
If he could

1944
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:33,850
get his little fucking shit tickers going.
Yeah.

1945
01:49:34,700 --> 01:49:39,460
And enough of you with your
defense contracting and
your global warming denying.

1946
01:49:39,490 --> 01:49:42,820
Ah, yeah. I know you just sort of feel
like, well at least I don't think,

1947
01:49:42,850 --> 01:49:45,550
I think you're too old to have too much
of a sway in this other than your vote

1948
01:49:45,551 --> 01:49:48,100
still counts as much as mine does.
Talking to guys like

1949
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:51,010
that, just to find out what makes
them draw those conclusions.

1950
01:49:51,490 --> 01:49:54,940
But what I'm always fascinated
by is not on the show.

1951
01:49:54,970 --> 01:49:58,450
You've got people who,
you know,

1952
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:01,300
have contrary positions to what it,
but you're able to engage with them,

1953
01:50:01,301 --> 01:50:06,010
I think in a really, really
interesting at way that's not terribly,

1954
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:09,490
it's confrontational, but it's not, I
dunno, I didn't know how to describe it.

1955
01:50:09,491 --> 01:50:14,030
Right. But I've seen you do it and it's a,
it's a skill obviously. Yeah. Well, I, uh,

1956
01:50:14,230 --> 01:50:19,230
I like to talk to people that have strong
beliefs and systems and things rather

1957
01:50:19,601 --> 01:50:22,240
to find out what were the,
how their belief systems are formed.

1958
01:50:22,510 --> 01:50:25,630
I want to know that if there's,
is there a logical,

1959
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:30,130
rational sort of basis to their belief
systems or is it just that they've sort

1960
01:50:30,131 --> 01:50:34,690
of adopted this predetermined pattern,
which is very common? Very much so. Yeah.

1961
01:50:34,870 --> 01:50:38,200
I had a conversation with a guy in
Jujitsu class about global warming we was

1962
01:50:38,201 --> 01:50:41,830
talking to, and he just, he's 24 years
olds, a military kid, and he was, uh,

1963
01:50:42,130 --> 01:50:46,180
someone else brought up global warming
and the kid goes, it's a natural cycle.

1964
01:50:46,450 --> 01:50:50,470
It's always habits and natural
cycle. I go, you're not a scientist.

1965
01:50:51,090 --> 01:50:55,810
I go, you're a scientist.
You know, scientists show me
your phd. You're a scientist.

1966
01:50:56,560 --> 01:50:59,800
You're not a scientist. Right. I
started mocking him. I go, listen, man,

1967
01:50:59,830 --> 01:51:02,590
you're being silly. You don't know
what the fuck you're talking about.

1968
01:51:02,900 --> 01:51:05,710
Where'd you and where'd you get it?
Just tell me where you got that mindset.

1969
01:51:05,711 --> 01:51:10,040
Where did it come from? It's that no
nonsense, right wing mentality. Yeah.

1970
01:51:10,230 --> 01:51:11,530
They don't even question it.

1971
01:51:11,531 --> 01:51:14,980
It's clearly what's really fascinating
about it is that they're always

1972
01:51:14,981 --> 01:51:16,630
supporting big business,

1973
01:51:16,810 --> 01:51:20,260
but yet no one gets fucked over
more than blue collar folks.

1974
01:51:20,260 --> 01:51:23,790
When it comes to big business, no one
gets fucked over. When we start that too.

1975
01:51:23,791 --> 01:51:24,341
It's like some,

1976
01:51:24,341 --> 01:51:28,930
sometimes this outlook is actually the
one that's most injurious to you in a way

1977
01:51:28,931 --> 01:51:33,240
of of your own life and your own sort
of happiness in a way. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1978
01:51:33,340 --> 01:51:35,050
And I mean you,
if you think about it,

1979
01:51:35,051 --> 01:51:39,970
the people that are less educated for the
most part or more likely to work for a

1980
01:51:39,971 --> 01:51:43,030
company or need a company to employ them,

1981
01:51:43,330 --> 01:51:47,620
those are more likely people that
are going to get lower paying jobs.

1982
01:51:47,710 --> 01:51:51,430
Those are more likely people that
are going to need some form of public

1983
01:51:51,431 --> 01:51:52,630
assistance or the possible,

1984
01:51:52,960 --> 01:51:56,800
but yet those are the people that
have this pull yourself up by your own

1985
01:51:56,801 --> 01:52:00,670
bootstraps mentality and that the,
these fucking welfare rats,

1986
01:52:00,671 --> 01:52:02,800
they have all these crazy
ideas in their head.

1987
01:52:02,801 --> 01:52:07,390
Whereas the educated people who are
more likely to be able to fend for

1988
01:52:07,391 --> 01:52:12,391
themselves or more likely at least to
have the possibility to have a higher

1989
01:52:12,731 --> 01:52:14,620
paying job because of the
fact they're educated,

1990
01:52:14,621 --> 01:52:19,621
at least in theory or more
likely to support public
assistance or more likely to

1991
01:52:21,430 --> 01:52:25,810
be against some of the environmentally
destroying policies. Yeah.

1992
01:52:26,220 --> 01:52:30,130
Of of big businesses. It's real weird
how people just sort of form these,

1993
01:52:30,460 --> 01:52:33,850
these patterns that they lock into that,
as you said,

1994
01:52:33,940 --> 01:52:38,300
can be really against their
own self interest and self
benefit going forward. Um,

1995
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:41,050
but I don't know about you,
but I found like as I've gotten older,

1996
01:52:41,051 --> 01:52:44,070
like when I was in school,
I was a total like lip,

1997
01:52:44,460 --> 01:52:46,130
like almost as left as you could go,

1998
01:52:46,130 --> 01:52:49,580
as PC as you could go.
And as I get older I feel like I come,

1999
01:52:49,640 --> 01:52:52,760
I come to some sort of, not the
center, I'll always be to the left,

2000
01:52:53,030 --> 01:52:56,570
but you know what I mean? There's, there's
certain things about liberal, you know,

2001
01:52:56,571 --> 01:52:58,820
they get on my nerves as well.
Like, I mean, and that's just,

2002
01:52:58,940 --> 01:53:00,950
I feel like any fully rounded human being,

2003
01:53:00,951 --> 01:53:05,000
it's not going to always be in one
camp that's higher. Lee, you know,

2004
01:53:05,970 --> 01:53:06,601
the approach.

2005
01:53:06,601 --> 01:53:11,310
I think I'm very much a conglomeration
of liberal and conservative ideas.

2006
01:53:11,340 --> 01:53:14,280
I found like more and more, well,
there's an old saying, show me,

2007
01:53:14,300 --> 01:53:17,430
I'm a young man who, uh, show me.

2008
01:53:17,431 --> 01:53:21,510
I'm a young man who is not liberal
and I'll show you a man with no heart.

2009
01:53:21,690 --> 01:53:25,380
Show me an old man is not conservative
and I'll show you a man with no brain.

2010
01:53:25,890 --> 01:53:30,570
And it's that somewhere along the line
you realize that people need a certain

2011
01:53:30,571 --> 01:53:32,670
amount of difficulty in life.

2012
01:53:32,700 --> 01:53:36,240
They need a certain amount of hardship
and they need a certain amount of,

2013
01:53:37,060 --> 01:53:40,320
they need obstacles and needed
to overcome those obstacles.

2014
01:53:40,321 --> 01:53:43,830
And when you set it up so that they
never have to overcome obstacles,

2015
01:53:43,831 --> 01:53:47,700
and you give them a consistent
series of safety nets, they get lazy.

2016
01:53:47,790 --> 01:53:48,720
And that is true.

2017
01:53:48,750 --> 01:53:52,440
And that doesn't mean that all people
on welfare are lazy or that welfare is

2018
01:53:52,441 --> 01:53:54,870
only for the lazy.
That's ridiculous as well.

2019
01:53:55,140 --> 01:53:59,490
But there's some lazy fucking people out
there and not just lazy, Lazy Thinkers.

2020
01:53:59,820 --> 01:54:01,680
There's just,
there's a lot of weakness.

2021
01:54:01,720 --> 01:54:05,790
And when you give people
the lottery ticket, you know
what happens? They fucking,

2022
01:54:05,820 --> 01:54:07,620
they lose all their money
and they fall apart.

2023
01:54:07,650 --> 01:54:10,680
It's just people need
to accomplish things.

2024
01:54:10,920 --> 01:54:15,920
It's a part of the whole genetic sequence
that has been sort of ingrained in the

2025
01:54:17,161 --> 01:54:20,700
human species from all
of our past behaviors.

2026
01:54:20,730 --> 01:54:25,680
I mean all of our human reward systems
of accomplishing things and feeling good

2027
01:54:25,681 --> 01:54:29,550
about accomplishing things and building
up self confidence. And that's real,

2028
01:54:29,670 --> 01:54:33,330
you know, so the, the pull yourself
by your bootstraps in a lot of ways.

2029
01:54:33,331 --> 01:54:34,340
That's good advice.
Yeah.

2030
01:54:34,530 --> 01:54:39,530
Unfortunately it gets conglomerated
and attached to this hatred towards

2031
01:54:41,161 --> 01:54:45,360
homosexuals. It's weird, you
know, fucking pro war stance,

2032
01:54:47,200 --> 01:54:48,490
strong religion,

2033
01:54:48,580 --> 01:54:52,570
religious kind of a context
and flavor to things as well,

2034
01:54:52,571 --> 01:54:56,260
which kind of has a, you talk about
things happening when you're a kid.

2035
01:54:56,261 --> 01:54:59,560
I've always felt that, you know,
that's one of the things that,

2036
01:54:59,561 --> 01:55:03,670
that really influences your thinking and
the way that you have an outlook on the

2037
01:55:03,671 --> 01:55:04,840
world. It's, and it's,

2038
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:07,990
I think that's a part of what religion
does is they want to get your young and

2039
01:55:07,991 --> 01:55:10,370
they want to get you indoctrinated
and they want to sort of have a,

2040
01:55:10,420 --> 01:55:15,160
a good soldier for the, for the balance
going forward kind of a thing. Um,

2041
01:55:15,700 --> 01:55:18,790
and that, that was, I never grew up that
way. I don't know about you, but like I,

2042
01:55:19,150 --> 01:55:21,280
we're,
we're not a very religious household,

2043
01:55:21,580 --> 01:55:24,550
but I've certainly come across a lot
of religion and some of whom are like

2044
01:55:24,580 --> 01:55:28,390
totally awesome and really nice
and really, you know, I, I, my,

2045
01:55:28,420 --> 01:55:32,230
my wife actually came up really baptist
and there was some point like around

2046
01:55:32,231 --> 01:55:35,080
when she was 18 or 19, it's just
like, I can't do this anymore.

2047
01:55:35,530 --> 01:55:40,200
I'm tired of feeling bad
about myself for Xyz. Um,

2048
01:55:40,370 --> 01:55:42,010
you know,
and so she sort of left the fold,

2049
01:55:42,011 --> 01:55:44,430
but she said that was one of the
most difficult thing she ever did,

2050
01:55:44,431 --> 01:55:49,020
peeling away from really all of her
friends, all of, all of that, you know,

2051
01:55:49,021 --> 01:55:53,060
because of the entire, it was a nice
little safe bubble that she was in. And,

2052
01:55:53,061 --> 01:55:56,700
and she, she still likes a lot
of those people to this day. Um,

2053
01:55:56,940 --> 01:56:01,620
but overall it was something she felt
she had to do in order to sort of grow,

2054
01:56:01,621 --> 01:56:05,100
I guess, or, or, or make some sort of
separation from that time in her life.

2055
01:56:05,190 --> 01:56:06,840
Well,
there's a disconnect if you,

2056
01:56:06,841 --> 01:56:11,841
if you subscribe to religion and all
of its principles by the book you,

2057
01:56:13,261 --> 01:56:18,261
this is just a massive disconnect you
have to have with just reality itself.

2058
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:23,960
You're believing in Adam and eve and
resurrections and miracles and no evidence

2059
01:56:24,391 --> 01:56:27,420
whatsoever to support any of these
things that are completely contrary to

2060
01:56:27,421 --> 01:56:28,890
anything that you've ever experienced.

2061
01:56:29,160 --> 01:56:31,650
And then all the evidence that
you see of Science, oh earth,

2062
01:56:31,651 --> 01:56:34,200
there's only 6,000 years old
according to this book. Oh, okay.

2063
01:56:36,060 --> 01:56:39,900
Did they just find some hundred million
year old shit lies propaganda by the

2064
01:56:39,901 --> 01:56:44,670
liberal media? They were planted down
there by the, you know, by Barack? Yeah.

2065
01:56:44,671 --> 01:56:46,520
Well you know the homosexuals.
Yeah,

2066
01:56:48,400 --> 01:56:49,480
there's all have,
you know,

2067
01:56:49,481 --> 01:56:52,990
and they went down and they buried those
bones and they sort of acid dated them

2068
01:56:52,991 --> 01:56:54,810
somehow so that they
seem older than they are.

2069
01:56:54,910 --> 01:56:59,110
We know carbon dating. It's not an
exact sign. No. Fracking is a myth,

2070
01:57:00,310 --> 01:57:01,300
you know?
Meanwhile though,

2071
01:57:01,301 --> 01:57:04,720
they'll talk bad about homosexuals while
they're eating a shrimp cocktail and

2072
01:57:04,721 --> 01:57:05,351
you're like, Yo, dude,

2073
01:57:05,351 --> 01:57:09,520
you got to read the whole book because
there's more shit about not eating

2074
01:57:09,521 --> 01:57:12,750
shellfish. Then there is
about being gay. You know,

2075
01:57:12,760 --> 01:57:15,970
you're not supposed to eat shrimp
and not supposed to eat pigs.

2076
01:57:15,971 --> 01:57:18,760
Like there's a lot of shit that you're
doing wrong and that's supposed to work

2077
01:57:18,761 --> 01:57:23,530
on Saturday. That's right. Yeah. You're
not supposed to have religious tattoos.

2078
01:57:23,531 --> 01:57:27,190
You fuck head like that. So fuck yeah.
You're not supposed to tattoo your body.

2079
01:57:27,191 --> 01:57:30,520
That's in the Bible. People have
religious tattoos. It's like,

2080
01:57:30,521 --> 01:57:32,350
talk about not reading the whole book.

2081
01:57:32,420 --> 01:57:35,380
Yeah. Oh, exactly. I think, and
you just pick and choose. Sure.

2082
01:57:35,390 --> 01:57:39,710
One of the funniest things is, you know,
really hardcore, uh, Christians will,

2083
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:42,770
will make fun of Scientology,
which, fair enough? Go ahead.

2084
01:57:42,771 --> 01:57:45,500
I'm perfectly fine if you want
to make fun of Scientology, but,

2085
01:57:45,770 --> 01:57:49,790
but to obligate their own kind
of weird stories than that.

2086
01:57:49,791 --> 01:57:52,280
Their book presents as
well. It's like, yeah, it's,

2087
01:57:52,760 --> 01:57:56,360
there's a certain you are you not spotting
the irony here that there's a certain

2088
01:57:56,361 --> 01:58:01,361
similarity between their weird Phaeton
run sort of stories and your weird,

2089
01:58:02,090 --> 01:58:05,930
you know, died and reborn after three
days. Kind of an all of the sort of,

2090
01:58:06,380 --> 01:58:10,640
you know, stories that, that we
will sort of beggar reality as well.

2091
01:58:10,830 --> 01:58:15,030
Well I think compartmentalize thinking
is very dangerous and I think once you

2092
01:58:15,130 --> 01:58:19,140
just sort of make your mind up that
your way is the only way you stop being

2093
01:58:19,141 --> 01:58:21,960
objective and you cease
all introspective thought.

2094
01:58:22,380 --> 01:58:26,160
You get sort of locked into this
mindset and you put these blinders on,

2095
01:58:26,161 --> 01:58:28,440
they don't allow you see you,
you,

2096
01:58:28,441 --> 01:58:30,720
you just see yourself as
how ridiculous you are.

2097
01:58:30,900 --> 01:58:34,230
And that's how people get caught
doing dumb shit. Like Ted Haggardy,

2098
01:58:34,231 --> 01:58:37,830
the guy who was, oh God damn
running this giant religious church,

2099
01:58:37,831 --> 01:58:40,650
huge stadium filled with people.
That's right.

2100
01:58:40,710 --> 01:58:43,090
Meanwhile Smoking Crystal Meth,

2101
01:58:43,350 --> 01:58:45,100
Bang and gay prostitutes.

2102
01:58:45,101 --> 01:58:49,870
And there's this recent guy who was anti
gay marriage proponent who turns out he

2103
01:58:49,871 --> 01:58:50,704
had run a,

2104
01:58:50,760 --> 01:58:55,760
a a female drag strip show
homeboy's named Jamie.

2105
01:58:56,470 --> 01:58:59,290
This guy, it just came out the other
day, was in North Carolina, um,

2106
01:58:59,350 --> 01:59:01,660
politician and he was a fucking,

2107
01:59:01,720 --> 01:59:04,410
he's a drag queen and he hates guessing.

2108
01:59:04,550 --> 01:59:08,620
You see that there was that other one
recently where that KKK guy shot and then

2109
01:59:08,621 --> 01:59:11,230
they find out he'd had sex
with a male prostitute,

2110
01:59:11,260 --> 01:59:13,660
black male prostitute dressed as a woman.
Or

2111
01:59:15,220 --> 01:59:18,970
it doesn't take long before you've
somehow dig into these guys' history and

2112
01:59:18,971 --> 01:59:21,550
you're like, I, it's not even
surprising anymore really.

2113
01:59:21,551 --> 01:59:25,010
It's like I knew that little
skeleton was in your cousin Craig.

2114
01:59:25,011 --> 01:59:28,690
See that's the liberal media.
Just this man is in jail,

2115
01:59:29,120 --> 01:59:33,430
talk for himself. So the man's in
jail and they sell that information.

2116
01:59:33,431 --> 01:59:38,431
Just now have the information that he
has sex with a gay male prostitute.

2117
01:59:39,010 --> 01:59:41,560
How about where,
where were you a year ago?

2118
01:59:41,650 --> 01:59:45,550
Do you know how easy it is to doctor
macro fish so that they could go back and

2119
01:59:45,551 --> 01:59:48,570
look through it and it would be,
they're pretty easy. Pretty so,

2120
01:59:48,571 --> 01:59:51,590
so they're watching what you're
doing right now. Here's homeboy.

2121
01:59:51,880 --> 01:59:55,600
That's what he used to look like.
Oh really? His name's Steve Wilde.

2122
01:59:56,050 --> 01:59:59,320
Just just,
just a rough number of Cox in his mouth.

2123
01:59:59,321 --> 02:00:02,140
How many sets do you say
that a thousand lifetime?

2124
02:00:02,300 --> 02:00:04,360
I would say that probably
is a look at them.

2125
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:07,090
That's what face you just
want to fuck big fat.

2126
02:00:07,091 --> 02:00:10,150
Chubby cheeks probably knows
how to take a tick like a champ,

2127
02:00:10,570 --> 02:00:15,250
especially when he's got the earrings on.
Those are just handles big grips,

2128
02:00:15,910 --> 02:00:20,050
big grippy earrings. Look at them.
Silly Bitch Domini in the, by the way,

2129
02:00:20,051 --> 02:00:21,730
is nothing wrong with
dressing like a woman.

2130
02:00:22,210 --> 02:00:25,360
Nothing wrong with stuck in a thousand
cars. You're sort of, when you're,

2131
02:00:26,590 --> 02:00:29,680
when you espouse a certain viewpoint
that's totally against all of that,

2132
02:00:29,730 --> 02:00:29,890
you know,

2133
02:00:29,890 --> 02:00:33,220
and it's really mean spirited and
hateful towards that kind of a thing that

2134
02:00:33,221 --> 02:00:38,170
really gets on your nerves.
Yeah. It's ridiculous. Yeah,
but people love to do that.

2135
02:00:38,171 --> 02:00:39,280
They love to point the finger.

2136
02:00:39,281 --> 02:00:44,281
It's like no one loves to criticize women
for being promiscuous more than sluts,

2137
02:00:46,750 --> 02:00:50,980
sluts, love to shit on other
slots. Is that so? Oh good,

2138
02:00:51,010 --> 02:00:55,840
good Mowgli. Nick Carter,
Aka Craig. They do, man.

2139
02:00:55,841 --> 02:00:57,670
It's like a big thing with girls there.

2140
02:00:57,671 --> 02:01:02,350
The girls who are promiscuous love to
shit on other girls who are promiscuous.

2141
02:01:02,590 --> 02:01:05,380
They, oh is that fucking bitch? She's
a whore. She's a fucking everybody.

2142
02:01:05,660 --> 02:01:09,580
Meanwhile you're fucking everybody
you know and men do the same thing.

2143
02:01:09,610 --> 02:01:13,740
Guys who sleep around are constantly
shitting on guys who slipped her sleep or

2144
02:01:13,741 --> 02:01:16,720
had too much worse.
It's a common thing.

2145
02:01:16,721 --> 02:01:20,830
It's like people try to throw people
off the case like, oh it's like, yeah,

2146
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:25,100
exactly. It's like that self hatred thing
almost sometimes that that sorta like,

2147
02:01:25,110 --> 02:01:26,740
yeah,
there's definitely a lot of that.

2148
02:01:26,900 --> 02:01:31,320
You know used to see that about a guys
who used to steal jokes with sometimes

2149
02:01:31,330 --> 02:01:34,450
like accuse other people stealing their
Joe throw him off the case and other

2150
02:01:34,451 --> 02:01:36,810
comedians would be like,
is this motherfucking serious?

2151
02:01:37,130 --> 02:01:40,130
Like everybody knows you steal,
you do on

2152
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:40,751
stage.

2153
02:01:40,751 --> 02:01:44,450
And mitzia would constantly accuse people
of stealing as material because he was

2154
02:01:44,451 --> 02:01:47,860
the biggest and everybody would be like,
what the F is going on here?

2155
02:01:48,370 --> 02:01:51,110
But when you think about like the
most obvious defense, that's the one.

2156
02:01:51,140 --> 02:01:52,760
If I'm getting accused of something,
I'll just,

2157
02:01:52,790 --> 02:01:56,150
I'll just accuse other people of the
same thing that I'm running up into.

2158
02:01:56,330 --> 02:01:58,190
I was wondering that too,
like for you,

2159
02:01:58,580 --> 02:02:02,570
you know I talked about earlier about
like when I rate read Stephen King the

2160
02:02:02,571 --> 02:02:06,350
second time as an adult, as
a writer myself and trying
to break it apart. Do you,

2161
02:02:06,440 --> 02:02:07,730
do you do that with other comedians?

2162
02:02:07,731 --> 02:02:10,910
Do you like we'll listen to them the first
time and just like fuck that. So good.

2163
02:02:10,911 --> 02:02:13,900
And then the second time you
sort of try and look at their,

2164
02:02:13,940 --> 02:02:16,490
just see what they're doing. Not to,
not to copy it or steal anything,

2165
02:02:16,491 --> 02:02:17,960
but just see how,
how are,

2166
02:02:17,961 --> 02:02:21,320
how are they forensically almost putting
together these jokes and how were they

2167
02:02:21,820 --> 02:02:22,481
sort of,

2168
02:02:22,481 --> 02:02:27,250
what I really do is I like to go back
and listen to really old stuff to try to

2169
02:02:27,460 --> 02:02:29,380
understand the time period.

2170
02:02:29,381 --> 02:02:34,090
Cause I think that a lot of comedy is a
weird thing. Like a lot of old movies,

2171
02:02:34,490 --> 02:02:36,580
they,
they still hold up today.

2172
02:02:36,610 --> 02:02:40,300
Like if you go back and watch the hustler
with Jack, such a good movie. Yeah, yeah.

2173
02:02:40,360 --> 02:02:45,100
Great movie. Yeah. Paul knew
holds up completely today.
It's still a great movie.

2174
02:02:45,730 --> 02:02:49,480
But any comedy from 1962
very tough to listen.

2175
02:02:49,800 --> 02:02:52,500
Yeah, it's changed. It's
comedy changes so fast.

2176
02:02:52,501 --> 02:02:55,770
I think like some like horror or
or something like the hustler,

2177
02:02:56,220 --> 02:02:58,480
like the thing is as good now,
you know,

2178
02:02:58,590 --> 02:03:01,860
the Kirk Russell one as as it
was when it was made, but comedy,

2179
02:03:02,280 --> 02:03:05,640
there's a certain shelf life,
it evolves a lot faster I think.

2180
02:03:05,641 --> 02:03:09,990
And something that was really edgy at
one point becomes stale dated. I think.

2181
02:03:10,130 --> 02:03:15,030
Yeah, that's, that's sort of my
feeling about guys like Lenny Bruce,

2182
02:03:15,360 --> 02:03:19,290
who in my opinion is probably
the most important comedian ever.

2183
02:03:19,291 --> 02:03:22,170
And he was the guy who got arrested the
most and he was the guy who pushed the

2184
02:03:22,171 --> 02:03:27,171
boundaries of understanding language and
content and what's the intent of what

2185
02:03:27,361 --> 02:03:28,930
you're trying to say and what do you,
what,

2186
02:03:28,990 --> 02:03:33,240
what are we doing when we're suppressing
this intent? And he was a brilliant,

2187
02:03:33,241 --> 02:03:36,480
brilliant guy who went,
ultimately went mad.

2188
02:03:37,080 --> 02:03:40,440
I never followed him towards the end of
it. Oh yeah. He died of a heroin overdose.

2189
02:03:40,920 --> 02:03:41,610
He,
uh,

2190
02:03:41,610 --> 02:03:46,050
he went mad and he would go on stage
and just read transcripts of his legal

2191
02:03:46,051 --> 02:03:48,840
proceedings. I mean, it was, it
was really, really boring stuff.

2192
02:03:48,841 --> 02:03:51,360
Kauffman NASC kind of, no, no, no, no.

2193
02:03:51,361 --> 02:03:53,880
Because Kauffman was doing it ironically,

2194
02:03:54,180 --> 02:03:57,770
like he would stand on stage and play
mighty mouse theme song, go here,

2195
02:03:57,780 --> 02:04:02,070
I come to save the day and he would just
freak people out because they expected

2196
02:04:02,071 --> 02:04:04,260
him to do common and it would
just do weird shit. Yeah.

2197
02:04:04,530 --> 02:04:08,550
But Lenny was going nuts and
towards the end of his life, um,

2198
02:04:08,610 --> 02:04:13,610
he would go on stage and read directly
out of the transcripts and try to explain

2199
02:04:14,371 --> 02:04:16,920
why the judge was wrong.
But there was no humor really.

2200
02:04:16,921 --> 02:04:19,940
Just more like it was going crazy. Yeah.
And he was doing heroin all the time.

2201
02:04:20,040 --> 02:04:21,980
It means there's a lot
going on. Yeah. Yeah.

2202
02:04:22,110 --> 02:04:27,110
But I will listen to his comedy and try
to put myself into this sort of almost

2203
02:04:28,381 --> 02:04:32,010
innocent mindset of the people that
were listed are living in the 1960s

2204
02:04:32,011 --> 02:04:33,480
listening to this kind of comedy.

2205
02:04:33,481 --> 02:04:37,980
Trying to wrap my head around what kind
of an impact this guy would, would have

2206
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:38,401
had,

2207
02:04:38,401 --> 02:04:43,320
but I don't necessarily try
to deconstruct their comedy.

2208
02:04:43,860 --> 02:04:47,370
Comedy is different in a
lot of ways than fiction.

2209
02:04:47,371 --> 02:04:50,710
And I think in fiction when
you're reading a great novel,

2210
02:04:50,711 --> 02:04:52,710
like you're reading Moby
Dick or something like that,

2211
02:04:52,711 --> 02:04:57,480
it still holds true holds the test of
time. Yeah. When you, you, you read that,

2212
02:04:57,481 --> 02:05:02,481
you can kind of get a feeling for the
way the narrative is driven and the way

2213
02:05:03,241 --> 02:05:07,590
the, the use of words shapes the
environment that you're imagining.

2214
02:05:07,591 --> 02:05:12,170
And comedy is very different in
that. It's just, um, I guess I,

2215
02:05:12,210 --> 02:05:15,550
I certainly did when I was
first starting out, but I,

2216
02:05:15,590 --> 02:05:19,680
but I don't really do that anymore.
If I watch comedy now,

2217
02:05:19,681 --> 02:05:22,460
I watch it just to enjoy it.
Yeah. Try to watch it as a fan.

2218
02:05:22,520 --> 02:05:26,840
Yeah. Yeah. And I do, I mean, I do
the same thing with, with reading, uh,

2219
02:05:27,050 --> 02:05:29,240
and there's some stuff that you realize,
this is awesome.

2220
02:05:29,241 --> 02:05:32,360
This is outside of what I do,
I could possibly do anyways.

2221
02:05:32,700 --> 02:05:35,150
I imagine that you listened to
some comedians and it's the same.

2222
02:05:35,151 --> 02:05:37,220
It's like what they're doing is,
it's fabulous,

2223
02:05:37,490 --> 02:05:39,660
but it's so far field from the star.

2224
02:05:40,340 --> 02:05:44,450
It allows you to actually just to enjoy
it totally as a fan because there's no

2225
02:05:44,451 --> 02:05:46,970
worry about, wow, this is
going to influence me. Uh,

2226
02:05:47,420 --> 02:05:50,910
in some way that that would
be problematical. Sure.

2227
02:05:51,020 --> 02:05:52,520
Cause it's just so different.

2228
02:05:52,521 --> 02:05:57,320
But who's an example like that for you
as a writer is just so, so different?

2229
02:05:57,321 --> 02:06:01,700
Yeah. Um, well like, yeah,
like, like Margaret Atwood,

2230
02:06:01,701 --> 02:06:03,470
for example,
the Canadian writer,

2231
02:06:03,530 --> 02:06:06,460
she did like the Handmaid's
tale was made into a movie.

2232
02:06:06,490 --> 02:06:10,160
I don't remember that
you vomit or something.

2233
02:06:10,490 --> 02:06:13,070
If someone knows to run with me,
sorry.

2234
02:06:13,071 --> 02:06:17,450
Go ahead and want to do a week in prison
or read the Handmaid's tale of the

2235
02:06:17,451 --> 02:06:20,040
Margaret Atwood book.
No,

2236
02:06:20,420 --> 02:06:24,320
you read one a week for the rest
of your life. Like I'll do my week.

2237
02:06:24,380 --> 02:06:26,660
I'd lie rather take the prison term.
I'll tell you my presence,

2238
02:06:27,220 --> 02:06:30,350
but you don't understand it's going to
enrich you and grow you as a person. Oh,

2239
02:06:30,351 --> 02:06:33,710
okay. Yeah. I've come on, not the kind
of person I want to grow to be, you know?

2240
02:06:33,790 --> 02:06:34,600
Right.

2241
02:06:34,600 --> 02:06:37,470
Take a fucking a pineapple tree
and you grow it in the same

2242
02:06:37,770 --> 02:06:41,250
where you grow grapes. Right? It's
not the same environment. You fuck it.

2243
02:06:45,300 --> 02:06:50,040
I don't know if that's a good analogy.
I, you know, I worry about that too.

2244
02:06:50,041 --> 02:06:53,070
Cause I'm, I am a little bit of a
chameleon. So if I start reading too many,

2245
02:06:53,071 --> 02:06:57,480
say like newer books, suddenly that
becomes, or Westerns, you know,

2246
02:06:57,481 --> 02:06:59,520
I think I wanted,
my next book wants to be sort of like a,

2247
02:06:59,550 --> 02:07:02,010
like a horror western sort of
a thing. So first of all, you,

2248
02:07:02,130 --> 02:07:05,070
I need to read a lot of those
things just to situate myself,

2249
02:07:05,071 --> 02:07:08,340
I think in that time.
And you sort of get the feel for it,

2250
02:07:08,940 --> 02:07:12,260
but you do worry that you're going
to be like, you know, you want it,

2251
02:07:12,261 --> 02:07:14,820
don't want to be derivative. I
guess that's the thing. Right? And,

2252
02:07:14,821 --> 02:07:18,810
and that and that, you know, because
in, in, in comedy it's joke stealing,

2253
02:07:18,811 --> 02:07:21,990
but it's all plagiarism. It's the
same thing. And there's, there's,

2254
02:07:22,020 --> 02:07:25,470
there's some writers who probably get
too close to their source material and

2255
02:07:25,471 --> 02:07:26,730
then they find out later that like,

2256
02:07:26,760 --> 02:07:30,930
this is so close that it's
almost copying what this,

2257
02:07:30,990 --> 02:07:34,380
this other person is who I really
admire. I see why I did it, but fuck,

2258
02:07:34,410 --> 02:07:36,040
I'm not own self here.
I'm more

2259
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:37,390
like just this person.

2260
02:07:37,420 --> 02:07:39,910
Yeah. That's very common
in comedy in the beginning.

2261
02:07:40,030 --> 02:07:42,550
Yeah. Where you're looking for
your voice, right. Your style.

2262
02:07:42,551 --> 02:07:46,210
Like eventually I feel
it's like a thumbprint and
initially your thumb print is,

2263
02:07:46,211 --> 02:07:47,230
it's,
there's nothing on it,

2264
02:07:47,231 --> 02:07:49,870
but slowly the world's start
developing and you get something that's

2265
02:07:49,871 --> 02:07:52,300
distinctively your own
when it comes with time,

2266
02:07:52,430 --> 02:07:54,170
don't really know what you're doing yet.

2267
02:07:54,171 --> 02:07:56,750
And you want to be like
this guy that you admire.

2268
02:07:56,751 --> 02:07:59,350
So you start doing colony
that's similar to this guy.

2269
02:07:59,900 --> 02:08:04,170
For me on the beginning it was
Richard. Jenny course. Yeah.

2270
02:08:04,190 --> 02:08:05,930
In the mask.
I remember him in the one,

2271
02:08:05,931 --> 02:08:09,440
one of his one movie wants to stand up
was so much better than his movie stuff,

2272
02:08:09,441 --> 02:08:10,970
but I remember,
uh,

2273
02:08:11,020 --> 02:08:14,930
like being a big admirer of his and
then onstage like hearing myself going,

2274
02:08:14,990 --> 02:08:17,480
Oh my God, I'm like, I'm
ripping off his clothes.

2275
02:08:18,200 --> 02:08:22,820
There's so many guys who they start
out like, I mean, this is like,

2276
02:08:22,850 --> 02:08:26,840
I was essentially an open miker I was
like a year into my comedy career or

2277
02:08:26,860 --> 02:08:31,280
somewhere around there. And uh, I
realized it, but I see it all the time.

2278
02:08:31,281 --> 02:08:32,150
There's a lot of,
like,

2279
02:08:32,570 --> 02:08:36,200
there's a lot of David tell clones out
there and there was a few dean cook

2280
02:08:36,201 --> 02:08:40,570
clones for a while and there's
probably some Louis CK clay now. Yeah,

2281
02:08:41,080 --> 02:08:41,570
yeah.
Let me,

2282
02:08:41,570 --> 02:08:45,470
is this just a thing where someone admires
his style of comedy and they start to

2283
02:08:45,471 --> 02:08:49,640
imitate? I've, I've seen my own act
onstage as in someone else's mouth.

2284
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:54,560
It's got to feel weird, weird, parsing it
out. You're sort of like, that is, yeah.

2285
02:08:54,670 --> 02:08:58,960
And it's not, it's not necessarily the
actual, uh, joke that they've taken,

2286
02:08:58,961 --> 02:09:01,300
but they've taken more your,
you know what I mean?

2287
02:09:01,301 --> 02:09:03,250
You're starting at the essence
of the way that you present it,

2288
02:09:03,290 --> 02:09:06,930
what way you deliver things.
Also like your subject matter,

2289
02:09:07,140 --> 02:09:08,970
they'll just twist around
your subject matter.

2290
02:09:08,971 --> 02:09:13,380
And so it's not like your material
they're taking, but God damn, it's close.

2291
02:09:13,440 --> 02:09:17,010
It's just like you,
he can see the road that got them there.

2292
02:09:17,060 --> 02:09:20,760
That's only a couple of blocks away
from the source. Yeah. And you can't,

2293
02:09:21,060 --> 02:09:23,760
you can't really claim
originality cause the,

2294
02:09:23,780 --> 02:09:27,960
the real problem with originality is
there's no such thing because everybody,

2295
02:09:27,961 --> 02:09:31,140
yeah. And that's, you know, publishers
want that. They're like, what? What is,

2296
02:09:31,530 --> 02:09:36,470
it's like everything's been done already.
I hate unique viewpoints.

2297
02:09:36,780 --> 02:09:39,810
They can be unique but
ultimately original boy,

2298
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:44,190
the whole language is an original. What
if you're going to write about murder,

2299
02:09:44,280 --> 02:09:48,150
monsters, air, water,
the elements. I mean,

2300
02:09:48,151 --> 02:09:49,740
all those things have
been covered and done.

2301
02:09:50,280 --> 02:09:55,200
We all understand that any description
that you have of any of these various

2302
02:09:55,201 --> 02:09:59,910
aspects is going to resonate with
people because they directly have either

2303
02:09:59,911 --> 02:10:03,360
literary experience in it,
some film experience,

2304
02:10:03,361 --> 02:10:06,000
and then have an actual
real life experience. Yeah.

2305
02:10:06,150 --> 02:10:09,900
So there is no real truly
original thought anymore. Oh,

2306
02:10:10,110 --> 02:10:11,920
but I found, I don't
know about you with, uh,

2307
02:10:11,940 --> 02:10:13,950
with comedy or with some of
the other things you've done,

2308
02:10:13,951 --> 02:10:17,960
but one of the biggest leaps I made is
recognizing that my own life is, um,

2309
02:10:18,150 --> 02:10:21,780
has value. You know what I mean? There
are interesting moments in my life,

2310
02:10:21,810 --> 02:10:25,560
interesting scenes, things that I've
experienced and you bring them in,

2311
02:10:25,680 --> 02:10:28,390
in the service of a character.
It's, you know, it's,

2312
02:10:28,391 --> 02:10:31,620
it's transported and you're telling it
through, through a character's eyes.

2313
02:10:31,920 --> 02:10:34,100
And I've always felt like there,
you don't have to make anything up,

2314
02:10:34,120 --> 02:10:37,040
right. You're just going back and
remembering as deeply as possible.

2315
02:10:37,160 --> 02:10:41,160
And those things are original.
Even if it's within a story that it's,

2316
02:10:41,180 --> 02:10:43,160
it's self might've been
told a thousand times.

2317
02:10:43,490 --> 02:10:45,890
The one thing that you can go
back and you can stake a claim on.

2318
02:10:45,891 --> 02:10:48,410
It's like this comes from
some element of my own life.

2319
02:10:48,411 --> 02:10:49,760
And I know it has to be original.

2320
02:10:49,970 --> 02:10:53,870
Not mean even that's not original because
other human beings have experienced it.

2321
02:10:53,871 --> 02:10:56,240
And that's your hope is that you're
actually going to be able to reach into

2322
02:10:56,241 --> 02:11:01,010
their chest and really sort of have
some sort of reckoning between you.

2323
02:11:01,011 --> 02:11:04,460
So I'm sorta like synchronicity that
you meet, maybe. Hopefully, you know,

2324
02:11:04,490 --> 02:11:08,240
do I think the word isn't original?
The real,

2325
02:11:08,241 --> 02:11:09,920
the real word is derivative.

2326
02:11:10,190 --> 02:11:14,930
And the real problem that people have
is when they're intentionally derivative

2327
02:11:15,320 --> 02:11:20,120
and that what that does is
it stifles creativity. Yeah.
Because someone like say,

2328
02:11:20,450 --> 02:11:25,040
say if someone, I don't want to give
away the story, the of your book,

2329
02:11:25,041 --> 02:11:29,780
the troop. But if someone read your
book and decided, you know what,

2330
02:11:30,110 --> 02:11:34,490
I'm going to make my own story
about this exact scenario.

2331
02:11:34,700 --> 02:11:38,840
And then they kept going back to your
book and they started adding elements to

2332
02:11:38,841 --> 02:11:42,740
it with different dialogue,
but the same elements and you know,

2333
02:11:42,741 --> 02:11:47,240
and here's the fucking guy was,
I mean that's, that's gross.

2334
02:11:47,390 --> 02:11:52,060
And it upsets us when we find out
that your originality, we will,

2335
02:11:52,061 --> 02:11:55,930
we can see you have to be or perceived
to be originality is really just you

2336
02:11:55,940 --> 02:11:59,090
comping and twisting around the
original work of someone else.

2337
02:11:59,420 --> 02:12:02,380
It's very upsetting. Yeah. Oh yeah.
Yeah. And you feel like that's again,

2338
02:12:02,420 --> 02:12:04,820
why would you get into it in
the first place? You know, I,

2339
02:12:04,830 --> 02:12:08,060
but I know in publishing, say when
the Da Vinci Code came out, you know,

2340
02:12:08,061 --> 02:12:11,930
publishers were like, we need the
next Davinci code. And there would be,

2341
02:12:11,931 --> 02:12:12,940
there were a lot of uh,

2342
02:12:12,970 --> 02:12:16,400
sort of knock knockoffs of it with
the same kind of ideas and, and,

2343
02:12:16,401 --> 02:12:17,360
but they were actually,
you know,

2344
02:12:17,361 --> 02:12:21,560
the writers whether they wanted to write
them or not. Sometimes money, you know,

2345
02:12:21,561 --> 02:12:23,150
how has an influence there,
you know,

2346
02:12:23,151 --> 02:12:26,320
if someone's going to offer
you a nice amount of money to,

2347
02:12:26,360 --> 02:12:31,310
to write what you know is sort of a, a
bit of a knock off, um, you know, uh,

2348
02:12:31,400 --> 02:12:34,880
people, people may be enticed
into sort of doing that. You know,

2349
02:12:34,881 --> 02:12:36,980
whether that's why they got
into writing in the first place.

2350
02:12:36,981 --> 02:12:40,600
You have to assume not,
you know. Um, but uh,

2351
02:12:41,780 --> 02:12:46,330
uh, yeah, I found like there's this,
there's some element of that and there's,

2352
02:12:46,400 --> 02:12:49,160
there's some element of, um, you know,

2353
02:12:49,161 --> 02:12:52,820
our original publishers sort of
don't want originality sometimes.

2354
02:12:52,821 --> 02:12:56,000
Sometimes they're like, this is a known
commodity. This is working really well.

2355
02:12:56,240 --> 02:12:59,120
We would like you to do stuff
like, like this, you know?

2356
02:12:59,650 --> 02:13:02,270
And sometimes they're even scared of
original. I was like, Lenny Bruce,

2357
02:13:02,271 --> 02:13:06,890
I people who, who are that original,
they, it's not an easy road to hoe.

2358
02:13:07,250 --> 02:13:10,730
Whereas if you do sort of do maybe
a rip off of a Dane Cook Act,

2359
02:13:11,060 --> 02:13:14,960
I think you might get initially get a
better pop than you would if you're really

2360
02:13:14,961 --> 02:13:18,170
charting sorta really
original territory ends.

2361
02:13:18,190 --> 02:13:21,560
It depends on how well you're doing
it for an idiot and you're ripping off

2362
02:13:21,561 --> 02:13:24,020
someone like, yeah, you
might get a little reaction.

2363
02:13:24,021 --> 02:13:25,940
This is a few of those
guys out there right now,

2364
02:13:26,240 --> 02:13:30,770
but I think that what we appreciate
in someone is we appreciate artistic

2365
02:13:30,780 --> 02:13:32,100
expression,
meaning

2366
02:13:32,100 --> 02:13:37,100
that we're all influenced by music and
movies and literature and things that

2367
02:13:37,231 --> 02:13:40,950
we've experienced in life. There's
influences that are just undeniable,

2368
02:13:41,280 --> 02:13:43,890
but what is your intent when you
sit down to create something,

2369
02:13:44,160 --> 02:13:49,160
is your intent to express yourself
in you in your own unique language,

2370
02:13:49,710 --> 02:13:53,130
your own unique experiences
in your own creativity?

2371
02:13:53,520 --> 02:13:55,800
Or are you just copying shit?
Yeah,

2372
02:13:55,810 --> 02:13:58,620
when you're just copying shit that
makes us angry. Yeah, of course.

2373
02:13:58,680 --> 02:14:02,680
There's like a certain amount of
like hate that Nickelback gets yes.

2374
02:14:02,690 --> 02:14:04,890
That I'm not sure why they get that hate,

2375
02:14:05,220 --> 02:14:10,020
but I think that some of it has to do
with the fact that it seems like they

2376
02:14:10,021 --> 02:14:11,190
concocted it.

2377
02:14:11,400 --> 02:14:15,480
Like they went and put together
these songs based on some algorithm.

2378
02:14:15,560 --> 02:14:19,200
Yeah. Yeah. I don't know if
it's fair. I don't get it.

2379
02:14:19,201 --> 02:14:21,690
I don't know why the hate exist,
but boy,

2380
02:14:21,691 --> 02:14:23,580
if you want to fucking
make an audience laugh,

2381
02:14:23,610 --> 02:14:27,740
just talk about how Shitty
Nickelback is and people go, yeah,

2382
02:14:27,780 --> 02:14:28,740
they do suck.

2383
02:14:28,800 --> 02:14:33,800
But there's certain bands that probably
suck equally or worse that take,

2384
02:14:33,991 --> 02:14:35,850
get a free pass or suck in a total.
Yeah,

2385
02:14:35,890 --> 02:14:40,480
different way. I think what bothers
me, Mumford and sons, I said it.

2386
02:14:40,540 --> 02:14:43,960
Yeah. Even, I mean, I hate to
throw these guys under the bus,

2387
02:14:43,961 --> 02:14:45,430
but arcade fire a little bit.

2388
02:14:45,820 --> 02:14:50,150
Oh you don't know how they're Canadian
Canadian band and it's like there,

2389
02:14:50,380 --> 02:14:55,120
you know it's like if you're
being like super original,

2390
02:14:55,121 --> 02:14:58,780
that's almost in a way as a
fake originality, you know
what I mean? Like I've,

2391
02:14:58,781 --> 02:15:02,080
I've noticed that as well is like you're
not really as original as you think you

2392
02:15:02,081 --> 02:15:02,231
are,

2393
02:15:02,231 --> 02:15:05,020
but you've convinced other people that
you're really original and that's like a

2394
02:15:05,021 --> 02:15:07,840
double delusion.
Whereas Nickelback is what they are.

2395
02:15:07,990 --> 02:15:10,970
Well it's when someone's affected what
I get about Mumford and sons, I like,

2396
02:15:10,990 --> 02:15:13,780
I like a lot of their songs.
I think some of their songs are very good,

2397
02:15:13,781 --> 02:15:14,800
especially the early songs.

2398
02:15:15,130 --> 02:15:19,780
But now I feel like they're in this
groove of doing that certain kind of music

2399
02:15:19,781 --> 02:15:23,380
and so they dress a certain kind of way
and I'm like, you're wearing a costume.

2400
02:15:23,530 --> 02:15:26,020
You might as well be dressed
up as a fucking clown. Okay.

2401
02:15:26,021 --> 02:15:29,470
Cause you're dressed up like a guy.
You look like a pioneer or something.

2402
02:15:29,760 --> 02:15:31,630
You're out there with a
mason jar in your hand.

2403
02:15:31,631 --> 02:15:35,010
You're playing a fucking homemade fiddle
for what are you doing dude? Yeah, no,

2404
02:15:35,030 --> 02:15:38,470
in the middle of the field. Yeah. What's
up wheat field and the fucking piano?

2405
02:15:38,471 --> 02:15:41,800
What's going on here? You're,
you're, you're, you're,

2406
02:15:41,801 --> 02:15:44,230
this is an affectations and
you wonder if they started

2407
02:15:44,300 --> 02:15:46,680
that way or if they got
engineered like someone, some,

2408
02:15:46,790 --> 02:15:50,110
some producer came and said, listen,
we need more wheat fields. We unique.

2409
02:15:50,120 --> 02:15:53,810
I look at all these guys in jars
saying what the fuck is going on now?

2410
02:15:53,870 --> 02:15:56,450
Whether they started that way or whether
that's what's up with those boots.

2411
02:15:56,680 --> 02:15:58,420
Hoedown boots going on.
You

2412
02:15:58,450 --> 02:16:01,570
are you working in the field and then
you took some time off to sing or you a

2413
02:16:01,571 --> 02:16:05,080
multimillionaire rock star cause I
get confused. What's your fucking,

2414
02:16:05,110 --> 02:16:08,860
you're goofy beard. Fucking stop. Dot.

2415
02:16:08,890 --> 02:16:11,980
What's up with the fake trees behind
you too? That's even more offensive.

2416
02:16:14,200 --> 02:16:15,520
We're down home.
We're country.

2417
02:16:15,730 --> 02:16:20,080
It's not a fucking hotel lobby and Beverly
Hills doing a photo shoot with makeup

2418
02:16:20,081 --> 02:16:24,740
on. Fuck yourself. Well, I think
that, you know, you become a,

2419
02:16:24,850 --> 02:16:29,850
you also become a prisoner to your success
if you get a amount of success doing

2420
02:16:30,670 --> 02:16:33,030
a certain thing. Like I was talking
about this yesterday, but I,

2421
02:16:33,031 --> 02:16:36,700
I had a friend who was a fat guy who was
the agent told him don't lose weight.

2422
02:16:36,701 --> 02:16:38,390
You lose weight, you're
losing roles. Yeah.

2423
02:16:38,400 --> 02:16:40,720
Like he's like you're losing parts if you,
if you,

2424
02:16:40,750 --> 02:16:42,970
if you lose weight and like he is just,

2425
02:16:43,150 --> 02:16:47,280
he was trapped in this thing that
he had created this overweight

2426
02:16:47,460 --> 02:16:50,730
boring character. Exactly. Well
the, and that does seem to be like,

2427
02:16:50,731 --> 02:16:54,300
I'm sure you've talked about it before,
but like it's not as funny.

2428
02:16:54,301 --> 02:16:58,290
Like Joe Piscopo even getting ripped, you
know what I mean? You managed to do it,

2429
02:16:58,320 --> 02:17:02,490
but Joe Piscopo couldn't go from the sort
of weedy guy to like the big bulky guy

2430
02:17:02,491 --> 02:17:06,540
of like dead heat and maintain
being as funny as as he was.

2431
02:17:06,690 --> 02:17:08,850
And the same thing with fat.
If you lose the weight,

2432
02:17:08,851 --> 02:17:11,940
suddenly people are just like, oh,
you're not as funny. And why is that?

2433
02:17:11,941 --> 02:17:16,110
I'm not really sure. But there's the
physical comedy of just being a big guy.

2434
02:17:16,190 --> 02:17:18,000
Yeah.
I Dunno what happened with Joe Piscopo,

2435
02:17:18,020 --> 02:17:22,700
but I've heard the comparisons of you.
Oh really? Anna, you don't welcome it.

2436
02:17:22,701 --> 02:17:25,460
I imagine I don't give a fuck.
It doesn't bother. I did.

2437
02:17:25,490 --> 02:17:28,730
Maybe that's why it didn't work because
I didn't give a fuck if I get it.

2438
02:17:28,780 --> 02:17:31,800
Plus you came on the scene,
you were already big. Yeah.

2439
02:17:32,750 --> 02:17:35,920
You never understood is in some
other body position. You know,

2440
02:17:35,921 --> 02:17:37,720
you're always a big guy.
Back News

2441
02:17:37,720 --> 02:17:40,440
radio when I first saw you, so it wasn't
as big. I didn't really lift this,

2442
02:17:40,460 --> 02:17:42,490
which words back then?
I was just kickboxing,

2443
02:17:42,491 --> 02:17:46,180
but I had been a black belt in martial
arts since I was 17 so I had come from

2444
02:17:46,480 --> 02:17:50,740
this physical background from the
beginning where I, I kinda was really,

2445
02:17:50,750 --> 02:17:54,200
I'm self conscious about it.
When I first used to do comedy,

2446
02:17:54,201 --> 02:17:56,560
it would like kind of hide my
body a little. Oh really? Yeah.

2447
02:17:56,561 --> 02:18:01,090
We're like really bulky clothes to sort
of hide the my shape because I felt like

2448
02:18:01,091 --> 02:18:03,350
people wouldn't understand that.

2449
02:18:03,351 --> 02:18:06,460
I had seen guys on stage who were
muscular too and it'd be like well that's

2450
02:18:06,461 --> 02:18:10,900
really abstract going over is not smart
to like come up and like sort of a

2451
02:18:10,901 --> 02:18:13,270
ripped up or whatever. Really
Sean. Yeah they don't want,

2452
02:18:13,271 --> 02:18:16,450
people don't want to see that they would
do, they'd rather see you out of shape.

2453
02:18:16,930 --> 02:18:20,590
That's kind of funny to have gone go stage
with a big beer gut slapping your gut

2454
02:18:20,591 --> 02:18:22,240
while you're telling your punch line.

2455
02:18:22,520 --> 02:18:26,500
It's kind of funny but it doesn't mean
that you can't be funny and be fit.

2456
02:18:26,530 --> 02:18:30,190
It's like we have these ideas that
we know what's funny and what's not.

2457
02:18:30,220 --> 02:18:31,990
But you don't know until you see it.

2458
02:18:32,350 --> 02:18:35,200
And that's one of the reasons why someone
can't really teach you how to be funny

2459
02:18:35,380 --> 02:18:39,010
cause you could never teach Mitch Hedberg
like you never have a class in how to

2460
02:18:39,011 --> 02:18:41,960
be Mitch Hedberg. No, cause
it doesn't fit any rules. No.

2461
02:18:42,100 --> 02:18:44,790
He's his own entity entirely.
Yeah.

2462
02:18:44,800 --> 02:18:49,450
So you can't fit Joey Diaz. There's
gear, there's guys, you just,

2463
02:18:49,451 --> 02:18:51,280
you can't fit them into a mold.
It doesn't.

2464
02:18:51,730 --> 02:18:55,390
And then you realized somewhere
along the line, if it's funny to you,

2465
02:18:55,870 --> 02:19:00,700
it's about trying to figure out a way to
get inside people's heads and get them

2466
02:19:00,701 --> 02:19:04,720
to relate. They can relate. Yeah,
but it has to be funny. Do you,

2467
02:19:05,170 --> 02:19:10,160
and what's a lot of bad comedy is it's
not even funny to them. They're just you.

2468
02:19:10,240 --> 02:19:13,930
There's, there's a certain
stage of comedy. There's
two stages in the beginning.

2469
02:19:13,931 --> 02:19:17,950
The one stage number one is you
just do anything that works.

2470
02:19:18,580 --> 02:19:23,550
You just, they're like, there's like
hammers and saws and you just using tools,

2471
02:19:23,580 --> 02:19:25,060
which joke,
it's like a tool.

2472
02:19:25,690 --> 02:19:29,210
Once you get a certain
amount of proficiency and
confidence and certain amount

2473
02:19:29,211 --> 02:19:30,044
of stage time,

2474
02:19:30,290 --> 02:19:34,370
then you start doing things that you
think are funny and then that's the shift,

2475
02:19:34,580 --> 02:19:37,490
the shift. It goes from doing
things that you think will work.

2476
02:19:37,610 --> 02:19:41,390
And then I started and you look around
and they laugh and you're like, oh,

2477
02:19:41,391 --> 02:19:45,860
thank God. And then two, you get a guy who
goes on stage with like a half a grand.

2478
02:19:45,860 --> 02:19:50,000
He's like, why is this going on? Because
I see that. I'm like, Whoa, fuck.

2479
02:19:50,001 --> 02:19:52,610
Are you talking and the
audience starts laughing. Yes.

2480
02:19:52,640 --> 02:19:55,040
Because they relate to the
way this guy's thinking is,

2481
02:19:55,041 --> 02:19:59,060
he actually does see humor in what he's
saying. It's an honest vision of humor.

2482
02:19:59,080 --> 02:20:03,110
Yeah. And those two stages are very
distinct and there's a huge difference.

2483
02:20:03,111 --> 02:20:07,430
And that's the thing about joke thieves
and people who are derivative is they

2484
02:20:07,431 --> 02:20:11,030
never get out of that first stage,
even though as positive as they can get.

2485
02:20:11,450 --> 02:20:12,260
That's why the,

2486
02:20:12,260 --> 02:20:15,470
there's a lot of guys who started out
stealing jokes and then they stopped.

2487
02:20:15,530 --> 02:20:17,210
I could name names,
I will not.

2488
02:20:17,540 --> 02:20:21,050
But they stopped stealing and they started
writing original material and their

2489
02:20:21,051 --> 02:20:23,650
original material is dog shit.

2490
02:20:24,120 --> 02:20:26,660
And the reason why is they never
really learned how to do comedy.

2491
02:20:26,661 --> 02:20:30,440
They never really understand the language
of comedy because a big part of comedy

2492
02:20:30,441 --> 02:20:34,100
has to deal with honesty, both honesty
with the environment that you live in,

2493
02:20:34,101 --> 02:20:36,920
an honesty with yourself and how you
interface with all the people around you.

2494
02:20:37,190 --> 02:20:40,490
And if you're pretending you this comedic
genius, I'm really just a plagiarist.

2495
02:20:40,820 --> 02:20:42,690
You're fucking,
you're dealing with a lot of demons.

2496
02:20:42,710 --> 02:20:46,160
You're dealing with a lot of walls
you've built up in your psyche and those

2497
02:20:46,161 --> 02:20:49,220
walls just trip you up when you
try to write original stuff.

2498
02:20:49,370 --> 02:20:50,880
I would imagine that's the
same way with literature

2499
02:20:51,110 --> 02:20:54,890
very much, very much. And I think
that second stage, uh, is, is right.

2500
02:20:54,891 --> 02:20:57,400
The first stage is your
sort of, uh, you're,

2501
02:20:57,410 --> 02:20:59,790
you're almost emulating the
people that you love, you know,

2502
02:20:59,791 --> 02:21:02,540
and the second stage is you want
to do something on your own.

2503
02:21:02,810 --> 02:21:06,290
And that second stage I think with you
is dealing with the idea that you're

2504
02:21:06,291 --> 02:21:10,130
confident enough that this joke means a
lot to me. Whether it's going to go over,

2505
02:21:10,131 --> 02:21:11,330
I can actually deal with that.

2506
02:21:11,331 --> 02:21:13,910
Whereas in the first stage you couldn't
possibly deal with the reaction that

2507
02:21:13,911 --> 02:21:18,590
didn't feed some sort of
sense of accomplishment or
get them to laugh or that I

2508
02:21:18,591 --> 02:21:22,100
think sometimes with, with comedians
that I've watched, obviously I don't,

2509
02:21:22,101 --> 02:21:24,740
I rarely, rarely watched them through
the early stages of their career,

2510
02:21:25,010 --> 02:21:28,430
but they're there, the comfortability
there, and it's the same with writers.

2511
02:21:28,431 --> 02:21:30,440
They're like, if I fail, that's fine.

2512
02:21:30,441 --> 02:21:34,700
I wanted to fail doing something really
interesting, really original to me.

2513
02:21:34,910 --> 02:21:37,670
And that really is an expression of what
the hell I got into this in the first

2514
02:21:37,671 --> 02:21:38,660
place for

2515
02:21:39,310 --> 02:21:44,310
a good example of that is
a hunter Thompson in the
early days used to take f f

2516
02:21:45,091 --> 02:21:49,410
Scott Fitzgerald and just
retyping Oh yeah, he would,

2517
02:21:49,411 --> 02:21:52,770
he would retire the great Gatsby
over and over and over again.

2518
02:21:52,790 --> 02:21:56,220
And the idea was that I think he
did it with Hemingway's well. Okay.

2519
02:21:56,221 --> 02:22:00,870
And the idea was that he was learning the
rhythm of great writing and that there

2520
02:22:00,871 --> 02:22:05,760
was in, in writing down the
great writing of other people,

2521
02:22:05,910 --> 02:22:09,930
you sort of develop a sense of the rhythm.
Yeah, I could see that. And in a way,

2522
02:22:09,990 --> 02:22:14,910
that's how I got into comedy because
I would like see like an HBO special.

2523
02:22:15,090 --> 02:22:18,630
And then I would tell my friends, Holy
Shit, did you see Sam Kinison last night?

2524
02:22:18,780 --> 02:22:19,561
He had this joke.

2525
02:22:19,561 --> 02:22:22,500
And then I would tell them the joke and
they would laugh at me telling them the

2526
02:22:22,501 --> 02:22:27,501
joke and I would sort of realize
through rhythm of doing Sam's material,

2527
02:22:27,780 --> 02:22:31,770
you know, in his voice, you know, and
I was married for two fucking years.

2528
02:22:32,010 --> 02:22:32,880
Oh Wow.

2529
02:22:33,200 --> 02:22:36,930
How about like club bed and your friends
are laughing and you kind of get the

2530
02:22:36,931 --> 02:22:40,710
rhythm of this,
this thing which is very similar to what

2531
02:22:41,230 --> 02:22:43,750
what learner did. Yeah, absolutely.

2532
02:22:43,820 --> 02:22:44,660
Did you ever do that?

2533
02:22:44,661 --> 02:22:48,860
Did you ever try to like picture yourself
writing a great piece that someone

2534
02:22:48,861 --> 02:22:51,090
else had written and just like go over it?

2535
02:22:51,180 --> 02:22:55,500
I did a lot of, um, not quite like
that, but similarly like you'd,

2536
02:22:55,501 --> 02:22:56,334
you'd read a,

2537
02:22:56,730 --> 02:23:00,150
there are some writers probably the same
as some comedians who style seems so

2538
02:23:00,780 --> 02:23:05,420
easy to imitate. It was an example.
Well Ray Carver, the short story writer,

2539
02:23:05,430 --> 02:23:08,610
the American short story writer would be
an example of a style that you look at

2540
02:23:08,611 --> 02:23:11,820
and you're like, I could do
this, but you can't. Once you,

2541
02:23:11,821 --> 02:23:15,000
once you really set your mind to like,
I'll try and write a carver type story.

2542
02:23:15,990 --> 02:23:19,590
That's what makes the genius there
I think is that it seems easy.

2543
02:23:19,591 --> 02:23:21,420
It seems that something you can do,
but,

2544
02:23:21,480 --> 02:23:25,260
but the genius is not only in the
genius of him but in the genius of his

2545
02:23:25,261 --> 02:23:26,730
deceptively simple style.

2546
02:23:26,731 --> 02:23:30,240
So I tried to write say a carver story
and it was a total nightmare and a

2547
02:23:30,241 --> 02:23:34,380
failure. Um, you know, we have things
in the writing recom trunk stories,

2548
02:23:34,530 --> 02:23:36,450
basically stories that you write,
you throw him in a trunk,

2549
02:23:36,451 --> 02:23:39,180
you're never going to see him again.
And my trunk is full of stories like that.

2550
02:23:39,181 --> 02:23:42,270
And I imagine your, your trunk
similarly, it's full of stuff.

2551
02:23:42,271 --> 02:23:45,870
And these are all things that like
you need to go through. I mean, I, I,

2552
02:23:45,990 --> 02:23:50,990
I probably was rejected 200 times at
magazines before I finally placed a story.

2553
02:23:51,661 --> 02:23:55,650
Like I could literally have
filled a shopping bag or a
pillowcase with rejection

2554
02:23:55,651 --> 02:23:57,510
slips.
When you have an idea for a story,

2555
02:23:57,511 --> 02:24:01,410
how many of those ideas actually wound
up being wind up being stories that you

2556
02:24:01,411 --> 02:24:05,700
will turn into a book or a
short story? Well, it's a,

2557
02:24:05,730 --> 02:24:09,170
it's a pretty small percentage. Uh,
in terms of the ones that you know,

2558
02:24:09,180 --> 02:24:12,690
I always think of, it's like a, you
know, the way a pearl gets created,

2559
02:24:12,691 --> 02:24:13,920
you've got like an oyster and us,

2560
02:24:13,921 --> 02:24:17,970
a little bit of sand gets in it and
then if enough like Nacro whatever goes

2561
02:24:17,971 --> 02:24:19,590
around it, then I'm like,
okay, that's enough.

2562
02:24:19,590 --> 02:24:21,570
It feels like the characters
are strong enough.

2563
02:24:21,571 --> 02:24:24,180
I've got an idea of the plot and
where I want to send these characters.

2564
02:24:24,570 --> 02:24:27,660
Then you sort of harvest that
pearl and it becomes a short story,

2565
02:24:27,661 --> 02:24:30,810
becomes a novel, but there's
several that just are imperfect.

2566
02:24:30,811 --> 02:24:33,750
You can tell just in their conception
they're imperfect. I don't have it.

2567
02:24:33,780 --> 02:24:38,070
You know, it's different, right? I see.
I would write a store, I'd send it out.

2568
02:24:38,310 --> 02:24:39,240
If it's not working,

2569
02:24:39,241 --> 02:24:42,510
you don't really know until you get
enough rejections that it's clearly, okay,

2570
02:24:42,511 --> 02:24:45,720
that's this fucking thing ain't working.
Do you guys get up on stage?

2571
02:24:45,721 --> 02:24:47,310
That's the different,
or like have you ever,

2572
02:24:47,760 --> 02:24:51,480
how many times do you tell a joke that
you really feel strong about or work on a

2573
02:24:51,481 --> 02:24:53,730
piece of material before
you have to say this,

2574
02:24:53,910 --> 02:24:57,090
this isn't meeting my expectation of what
I thought or do you just keep telling

2575
02:24:57,091 --> 02:24:58,610
it anyway and just say fuck it.
This is

2576
02:24:58,770 --> 02:25:01,470
the depends.
Depends on how much I really enjoy it.

2577
02:25:01,500 --> 02:25:04,750
There's certain ones just fucking
never work and I do. I'm just for,

2578
02:25:05,560 --> 02:25:07,260
there's certain ones
that are right and I go,

2579
02:25:07,261 --> 02:25:09,630
I know this has got something but
I can't figure out what it is.

2580
02:25:10,050 --> 02:25:13,260
And then there's certain,
there's certain bits that as I write them,

2581
02:25:13,261 --> 02:25:16,380
they come out and fully finished
form. Yeah. Oh that's brilliant.

2582
02:25:16,381 --> 02:25:16,880
One that happened.

2583
02:25:16,880 --> 02:25:20,940
I got one of my favorite bits and I'm
doing right now that is in the moment.

2584
02:25:20,941 --> 02:25:23,230
I wrote it on a plane and I wrote it.

2585
02:25:23,231 --> 02:25:28,231
It's like a 10 minute piece and I wrote
it in its full form on a plane and I did

2586
02:25:28,331 --> 02:25:33,000
it on stage that Monday and
it just destroyed. It was,

2587
02:25:33,100 --> 02:25:36,340
it was like, it was done. Like
from the minute it came out,

2588
02:25:36,341 --> 02:25:37,530
it came out in June and it was,

2589
02:25:38,030 --> 02:25:41,650
it resonated with me and I was so
angry when I wrote it and it was so,

2590
02:25:41,651 --> 02:25:42,484
it was the,

2591
02:25:42,550 --> 02:25:45,790
it was a about a certain particular
group of people that are so incredibly

2592
02:25:45,791 --> 02:25:50,230
hypocritical and ridiculous that it was
due and I'd caught someone lying about

2593
02:25:50,231 --> 02:25:53,290
something and it was in this
group of people and I was like,

2594
02:25:53,650 --> 02:25:58,650
I have had enough of this and I just
went on and married came out like as a

2595
02:26:00,101 --> 02:26:03,790
chunk it was done. Then there's other
bits, like I know there's something there,

2596
02:26:03,791 --> 02:26:06,430
but I don't know what it is.
Yeah. And sometimes they,

2597
02:26:06,431 --> 02:26:10,960
those bits will last for years and I'll
throw them in like every third or fourth

2598
02:26:10,961 --> 02:26:13,780
set. When I'm killing in the middle,
I'll throw it in there and that'll just,

2599
02:26:13,810 --> 02:26:16,440
the audience be like, what the fuck is
that? I'm like, all right, you got it.

2600
02:26:16,790 --> 02:26:18,320
It's got to die.
Yeah.

2601
02:26:18,321 --> 02:26:21,680
Sometimes it's like you feel the energy
of the room and maybe I can slip this in.

2602
02:26:21,681 --> 02:26:24,740
And it's, I mean with me too,
I think it's a matter of,

2603
02:26:24,741 --> 02:26:28,070
I've had some stories that constantly
got rejected and then you, you,

2604
02:26:28,130 --> 02:26:31,370
I think you get a bit of a
name for yourself and then
those will find acceptance

2605
02:26:31,371 --> 02:26:34,220
because they're like, okay, well he's
done this and this and this. But then,

2606
02:26:34,490 --> 02:26:37,730
but I find to me like speed is something
like I wrote the true probably in about

2607
02:26:37,731 --> 02:26:41,480
six weeks, which is the fastest I've
ever written anything. But it was fun.

2608
02:26:41,481 --> 02:26:41,661
You know,

2609
02:26:41,661 --> 02:26:44,720
I'd come out of wherever the room
where I write in my wife would be like,

2610
02:26:44,721 --> 02:26:46,490
you look energized.

2611
02:26:46,491 --> 02:26:50,000
You don't look like all the dragon
haggard like you do when you stumble out

2612
02:26:50,001 --> 02:26:51,380
after working on your other books.

2613
02:26:51,380 --> 02:26:55,370
Like a vampire has been stuck
in your blood out for eight
hours. Um, and I'm like,

2614
02:26:55,371 --> 02:26:58,940
that's sort of what has told me that I
hope I am able to write a lot more books

2615
02:26:59,060 --> 02:27:02,690
in the horror genre because I just enjoy
the writing of it. It's more fun to me.

2616
02:27:02,691 --> 02:27:05,060
It's more, it comes like that. And I mean,

2617
02:27:05,600 --> 02:27:07,910
the reason I think that came
to you so fast, first of all,

2618
02:27:07,911 --> 02:27:09,320
because you're passionate about it,
but second of all,

2619
02:27:09,321 --> 02:27:11,930
because you've been working at it a
long time and when those things come,

2620
02:27:11,931 --> 02:27:15,530
you know how to deal with them. And
I think now I know better. Okay,

2621
02:27:15,531 --> 02:27:18,740
if the idea comes to me and it's, I'm,
I'm ready to make, make hay with it.

2622
02:27:19,420 --> 02:27:21,730
Well I think you should really
read a lot more harm man.

2623
02:27:21,940 --> 02:27:24,970
But just because of what you said and
because of the book being really fun.

2624
02:27:25,250 --> 02:27:27,520
I love that as that genre.

2625
02:27:27,521 --> 02:27:30,550
And I love when a book
like that comes out.

2626
02:27:30,790 --> 02:27:35,590
And so you saying that like this is
something that like thrilled you and

2627
02:27:35,591 --> 02:27:38,800
energize you as your rent. I really
hope you keep doing that, man.

2628
02:27:38,950 --> 02:27:41,290
Not, yeah, no, I appreciate
it. Thank you. And I'm, we're,

2629
02:27:41,291 --> 02:27:45,100
we're sort of in between contracts
right now. So I don't know. I might be,

2630
02:27:45,330 --> 02:27:48,300
you know, selling oranges on the side of
the freeway for all that. I know. When,

2631
02:27:48,301 --> 02:27:52,510
when, when I next w when I next see you,
I see you come to Massey Hall right?

2632
02:27:52,511 --> 02:27:53,470
I will,
I'll have to come out.

2633
02:27:53,471 --> 02:27:58,330
I saw you were at Massey Hall once in
Toronto in a couple of times and the Sony

2634
02:27:58,330 --> 02:28:00,930
Centre reisling go and check
that out. But anyways, we're,

2635
02:28:00,940 --> 02:28:04,270
we're sort of in that weird space where
I don't really know what's going to

2636
02:28:04,271 --> 02:28:07,780
happen. Exactly. So, so hopefully
I'll have good news. Listen man,

2637
02:28:07,781 --> 02:28:11,020
you could self publish. This
is a new era. It's true. Yeah.

2638
02:28:11,021 --> 02:28:12,430
There is a lot more of that going on.

2639
02:28:12,490 --> 02:28:14,470
Some huge successful
people doing it that way.

2640
02:28:14,580 --> 02:28:15,900
Unbelievable success.

2641
02:28:15,901 --> 02:28:18,870
People have had unknown's that have put
out something and just through word of

2642
02:28:18,871 --> 02:28:22,280
mouth through Amazon and
what have you and your books.

2643
02:28:22,580 --> 02:28:25,820
It's incredible, isn't it? Gaps
in publishers who, who you wonder,

2644
02:28:25,821 --> 02:28:30,720
like I read this book wool by a writer
called Hugh Howey and it's Sorta Saifai

2645
02:28:30,890 --> 02:28:33,290
really, really damn good.
And your end, you know,

2646
02:28:33,291 --> 02:28:36,350
you find out his history as he's been
rejected by x number of publishers and

2647
02:28:36,351 --> 02:28:40,160
you're like, how did that happen? You know
what I mean? But it does. It does happen.

2648
02:28:40,161 --> 02:28:43,070
And it's great that there's that
opportunity now that like, okay,

2649
02:28:43,071 --> 02:28:44,840
well listen that, that's fine. I get it.

2650
02:28:44,841 --> 02:28:47,390
You guys have whatever
agenda that you're pursuing.

2651
02:28:47,960 --> 02:28:51,400
This is what I want to write and
I have a way to get it out to my,

2652
02:28:51,470 --> 02:28:54,500
my hopefully readership and
build it that way. Now is this,

2653
02:28:54,740 --> 02:28:58,880
is this book the truth? Is it out now?
Uh, yeah. Yeah. When did you come out?

2654
02:29:00,550 --> 02:29:04,160
You got an arc of it? Yeah. It came out
a couple months ago. Yeah, there it is.

2655
02:29:04,161 --> 02:29:05,360
There's a new cover too.
They just,

2656
02:29:05,361 --> 02:29:08,320
they totally changed the cover
while they changed the Koa. Darker.

2657
02:29:08,340 --> 02:29:11,210
It's just something that they do
in publishing from time to time.

2658
02:29:11,211 --> 02:29:15,500
I'm not sure why either. But yeah,
they made a big, a big change of it.

2659
02:29:15,501 --> 02:29:18,920
So now it's just an isolated guy
on a hilltop or something. Well,

2660
02:29:18,921 --> 02:29:22,490
I got the best one I liked.
I liked that one too with the,

2661
02:29:23,360 --> 02:29:27,110
that's the, uh, the UK cover. It
looks that way. Yeah. With the, the,

2662
02:29:27,111 --> 02:29:30,440
the birds and the lightening
flashes. I like it. Yeah.

2663
02:29:32,570 --> 02:29:35,780
I like the American cover, but yeah,
it's totally, totally different for sure.

2664
02:29:35,810 --> 02:29:38,030
Have you started writing a new one?
Yeah,

2665
02:29:38,031 --> 02:29:41,480
the followup is we did do that one for
sure. It's called the deep, so it takes,

2666
02:29:41,570 --> 02:29:46,570
I love undersea stuff and like I love
like the ocean so it takes place at the

2667
02:29:46,581 --> 02:29:47,780
bottom of the Mariana.

2668
02:29:47,900 --> 02:29:52,640
You know when a James Cameron went
down in that so eight miles below the

2669
02:29:52,641 --> 02:29:56,300
surface. Crazy fuck he is. I know
he's a nut. He's out of his mind.

2670
02:29:56,330 --> 02:30:00,740
He is out of his mind a millions of
dollars to the bottom of the ocean fucking

2671
02:30:00,741 --> 02:30:04,880
boat. Yeah. And just, you know, picks up
what, there's nothing down there either.

2672
02:30:05,430 --> 02:30:08,630
The first God ever do that too. He
is. He is. And I don't know if you,

2673
02:30:08,631 --> 02:30:09,261
I don't know about you.

2674
02:30:09,261 --> 02:30:13,280
Like claustrophobia is one thing that
I'm not good but in tight spaces and if

2675
02:30:13,281 --> 02:30:16,560
you saw what he went down in, it
was basically like he had, you know,

2676
02:30:16,610 --> 02:30:19,630
metal down this side of this side. He
basically went down in a coffin. Yeah.

2677
02:30:19,820 --> 02:30:21,350
I don't have a problem with tight spaces.

2678
02:30:21,351 --> 02:30:24,660
I do have a problem with tight spaces
at the bottom of the notion though,

2679
02:30:25,880 --> 02:30:30,170
how many miles deepest? Well challenger
deep is, is below the Marianas trench.

2680
02:30:30,171 --> 02:30:31,160
So that's eight miles.

2681
02:30:31,161 --> 02:30:35,330
And the pressure is something like seven
jumbo jets per like pressing down on

2682
02:30:35,331 --> 02:30:40,160
your per square foot. So
yeah, it's, I feel like that.

2683
02:30:40,490 --> 02:30:43,940
See, I don't know about you. What are
you scared of? That's interesting.

2684
02:30:43,941 --> 02:30:45,890
Are you yeah,
like animals,

2685
02:30:46,940 --> 02:30:50,420
animals I find with a kid now I'm
afraid of shit happened into my,

2686
02:30:50,440 --> 02:30:53,050
my soul for something. That's
thing, but it's the Marriott,

2687
02:30:53,051 --> 02:30:55,200
look at this image of that Jamie
just pulled there it is. She's,

2688
02:30:56,650 --> 02:30:58,070
so there's Mount Everest.

2689
02:30:58,100 --> 02:31:00,890
That's the height of Mount
Everest compared to the deep,

2690
02:31:00,990 --> 02:31:05,720
the deepness of challenging.
So yeah, that's insane. It is.

2691
02:31:06,080 --> 02:31:09,740
Miles miles down. That's the deepest
part of the ocean that we're aware of.

2692
02:31:09,741 --> 02:31:10,940
Is that what it is that we're aware of?

2693
02:31:11,440 --> 02:31:14,720
There might be a spot somewhere that they
haven't other could very well be. Yeah,

2694
02:31:14,721 --> 02:31:18,710
exactly. But um, that's
the deepest known depth.

2695
02:31:18,820 --> 02:31:20,100
Damn deep.

2696
02:31:20,120 --> 02:31:24,450
Yeah. That is so ridiculous.
But I figured, okay,

2697
02:31:24,480 --> 02:31:27,060
well I don't like tight spaces.
I don't like that pressure.

2698
02:31:27,061 --> 02:31:31,290
I don't like the dark like down there
darknesses I mean I don't think it's like

2699
02:31:31,291 --> 02:31:33,390
the darkness between the stars.
It's that dark.

2700
02:31:33,391 --> 02:31:36,570
It's probably a darkness that I don't
know if I've ever grappled with. So yeah,

2701
02:31:36,571 --> 02:31:40,440
for a horror book it sort of has a lot
of potential of things that scare the

2702
02:31:40,441 --> 02:31:42,540
shit out of me. And that's sort
of where I got to start with.

2703
02:31:42,600 --> 02:31:45,180
Is it like a monster book? No, no, no.

2704
02:31:45,181 --> 02:31:47,700
It's a ghost.

2705
02:31:48,840 --> 02:31:52,860
So they're billing it as sort of
like the abyss meets the shining.

2706
02:31:52,920 --> 02:31:56,220
So there is kind of that that you
know, the, the shining being like, oh,

2707
02:31:56,280 --> 02:31:57,390
it's almost like a haunted,

2708
02:31:58,090 --> 02:32:01,680
they've set up a research station down
there and it's another crew going down to

2709
02:32:01,681 --> 02:32:04,760
figure out what the hell happened to the
crew beforehand. I could have read it.

2710
02:32:04,790 --> 02:32:09,720
Yeah. Yeah. So, so I'm done.
It's all done. It's all done.

2711
02:32:09,780 --> 02:32:14,040
Yes. I will make sure you get a priority.
Uh, when the art comes out I'll,

2712
02:32:14,041 --> 02:32:17,430
I'll get one shipped. When do you think
it will be done? Well, I don't know.

2713
02:32:17,431 --> 02:32:21,600
I feel like they probably are going
to do a few. If soon they're there,

2714
02:32:21,680 --> 02:32:23,910
they're put there. It's
every, it's the year after.

2715
02:32:23,911 --> 02:32:27,470
So basically it's January of next
year, but you'll, the arcs will be out,

2716
02:32:27,520 --> 02:32:29,920
you know. But do they, when
you do something like that,

2717
02:32:29,921 --> 02:32:33,070
like do you bring it to the publisher
and the publisher gives notes?

2718
02:32:33,600 --> 02:32:37,350
Yes. Yeah. Um, basically you,
I got a two book contract,

2719
02:32:37,351 --> 02:32:39,600
so I had already written the troop,
gave it to my agent.

2720
02:32:39,601 --> 02:32:41,820
My agent sent it into the publisher.
They accepted, they say, well,

2721
02:32:41,821 --> 02:32:44,310
we want another book too. What's
your idea? I said, and on something,

2722
02:32:44,340 --> 02:32:46,260
something to do with down in the
ocean. They said, good. Sold.

2723
02:32:46,710 --> 02:32:50,760
So you write that one and then you
just send it to your editor and he,

2724
02:32:50,761 --> 02:32:53,820
in this case, yeah, it gave me all
sorts of notes and uh, you know,

2725
02:32:53,821 --> 02:32:56,970
you work on that and you go back and
forth and then eventually at some point we

2726
02:32:56,971 --> 02:33:00,900
say, we're fucking sick of
this. Are we done? Yes, we're
done. So That's interesting.

2727
02:33:00,980 --> 02:33:04,810
No, who's qualified to give you
notes like that? Like, how do,

2728
02:33:04,880 --> 02:33:08,150
how do you distinguish whether or not
someone's qualified to give you notes?

2729
02:33:08,151 --> 02:33:10,280
And do you often disagree
with their notes?

2730
02:33:10,570 --> 02:33:14,230
Yes. Cause you wouldn't, I guess you
wouldn't have that really. I mean,

2731
02:33:14,231 --> 02:33:16,990
you might have trusted people
that you would deal with and say,

2732
02:33:16,991 --> 02:33:20,490
well what do you think of this bit? You
know, so don't even do that. No, no, no.

2733
02:33:20,500 --> 02:33:22,470
The audience does it. Ah,
that's right. They're,

2734
02:33:22,471 --> 02:33:25,810
that they're the most serious arbiter of
things. Yeah. They're the grand judge.

2735
02:33:25,840 --> 02:33:26,770
Do Myself.

2736
02:33:27,640 --> 02:33:32,640
Beautiful thing about materials that you
get to listen to it on my iPhone or my,

2737
02:33:32,801 --> 02:33:35,770
um, my note, my galaxy note three has,

2738
02:33:36,200 --> 02:33:41,200
I've had have it for like maybe four or
five months and it might have hundred

2739
02:33:42,931 --> 02:33:47,050
and 50 sets on it. Oh Wow. Yeah.
And I can listen to all those sets

2740
02:33:47,220 --> 02:33:50,460
and then started the audience reaction
and gauge how it's working. So that's,

2741
02:33:50,461 --> 02:33:52,980
yeah, that's a similar idea
to it. To an editor, I mean,

2742
02:33:52,981 --> 02:33:56,250
an editor relationship with the writers.
Pretty, uh, pretty important obviously.

2743
02:33:56,251 --> 02:33:59,700
Because the one thing is you can't go
snatch your book off the shelves once it's

2744
02:33:59,701 --> 02:34:01,920
there. It's there. You
gotta live with how it is.

2745
02:34:01,921 --> 02:34:06,120
So you got to work as hard as you can
in this stage to make it as, I mean,

2746
02:34:06,150 --> 02:34:07,230
it's never going to be perfect.

2747
02:34:07,320 --> 02:34:09,870
There's going to be things about it
that you'll look at five years later and

2748
02:34:09,871 --> 02:34:12,240
just go, wow, why did I
do that? But each book,

2749
02:34:12,370 --> 02:34:13,920
I think each book probably just like each,

2750
02:34:13,921 --> 02:34:17,470
maybe one of your comedy cds is an
expression of that time in your life too.

2751
02:34:17,471 --> 02:34:18,040
And you got to let

2752
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:19,990
it be that. Well there is that. Right?

2753
02:34:20,250 --> 02:34:22,310
You know,
out of the hundred and 50 sets,

2754
02:34:22,700 --> 02:34:27,320
maybe a hundred of them are from
like a year ago that I've got stored.

2755
02:34:27,560 --> 02:34:32,150
Like I take the MP three and I saved
them and then maybe 50 of them or so,

2756
02:34:32,151 --> 02:34:34,420
or over the last four or five months.
Okay.

2757
02:34:34,430 --> 02:34:37,670
And then what I'll do is never
listened to the old ones,

2758
02:34:37,671 --> 02:34:39,290
but always think that I'm going to

2759
02:34:39,750 --> 02:34:42,170
pack rat. I go, hold on to them.

2760
02:34:42,550 --> 02:34:47,170
But the most recent ones are the really
important ones, like a on this phone.

2761
02:34:47,190 --> 02:34:48,100
This is a new phone.

2762
02:34:48,280 --> 02:34:52,630
It only has Santa Barbara only as Friday
night show in Santa Barbara. That's it.

2763
02:34:52,990 --> 02:34:55,600
But eventually,
you know over the course of a few months,

2764
02:34:55,630 --> 02:34:57,880
it'll have a like a Wednesday night,
I'm at the Ice House,

2765
02:34:57,940 --> 02:34:58,990
I'll have that set on it.

2766
02:34:59,230 --> 02:35:03,880
I'll listen to that Thursday and I'll
break out the notebook and I'll listen to

2767
02:35:03,881 --> 02:35:05,020
it,
the headphones on,

2768
02:35:05,021 --> 02:35:10,021
and then my next set I'll add the notes
and then I'll try to figure out what I

2769
02:35:10,361 --> 02:35:11,890
did differently then it'll grow.

2770
02:35:11,891 --> 02:35:15,330
But the beautiful thing about
comedy is it has built in editors.

2771
02:35:15,620 --> 02:35:19,900
Yeah. Audience and also you can, you can,
there's no sense of it being on a shelf.

2772
02:35:19,901 --> 02:35:22,380
You, it evolves as you, as you, you know,

2773
02:35:22,381 --> 02:35:25,630
you work the act over and you work the
act over in it and it sort of becomes,

2774
02:35:25,870 --> 02:35:27,400
and we do that as much as we can.
You know,

2775
02:35:27,401 --> 02:35:29,170
that book probably went
through seven or eight edits,

2776
02:35:29,530 --> 02:35:32,800
but at at some point you got to just
say, well that's it. We're on a schedule.

2777
02:35:32,900 --> 02:35:34,120
You can over edit it too.

2778
02:35:34,121 --> 02:35:37,580
You can sort of rip sort of the rawness
and I'm sure you can probably do that in

2779
02:35:37,660 --> 02:35:38,500
a comedy act as well.

2780
02:35:38,501 --> 02:35:42,460
You can rip some of the stuff that is
really most important. And most the Ron,

2781
02:35:42,490 --> 02:35:46,240
if you take the rawness out of the rough
edges and you make it sort of smooth it

2782
02:35:46,241 --> 02:35:50,200
over and you listen to too many editors,
then you can't please everybody.

2783
02:35:50,201 --> 02:35:52,060
I think that's another thing too.
I've recognized it

2784
02:35:52,310 --> 02:35:55,490
self. Like you lose your vision of
what, what is good and what's bad.

2785
02:35:55,491 --> 02:35:58,380
Because I know as a comic
you certainly can, you Lou,

2786
02:35:58,490 --> 02:36:02,960
you listen to a joke so many times you
just like it gets means like it's just a

2787
02:36:02,961 --> 02:36:04,280
bunch of gobbly gook to you.

2788
02:36:04,410 --> 02:36:06,210
Totally. Yeah, totally. And that's,

2789
02:36:06,211 --> 02:36:09,180
I guess that's a danger that we both
faced in our separate, you know,

2790
02:36:09,181 --> 02:36:12,990
but very close, closely
related kinds of careers. Um,

2791
02:36:13,020 --> 02:36:16,380
so it's about listening to the right
and ultimately it's like listening cause

2792
02:36:16,770 --> 02:36:18,750
especially with horror,
you have someone, you know,

2793
02:36:18,751 --> 02:36:21,120
I've had plenty of emails and
I'm, no, you have to like what,

2794
02:36:21,170 --> 02:36:24,150
what kind of a person are you?
Kind of an awful creature.

2795
02:36:24,151 --> 02:36:28,270
What sort of primordial swamp pit did
you crawl out of to, you know, uh,

2796
02:36:28,350 --> 02:36:33,300
become who you are. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

2797
02:36:33,301 --> 02:36:36,660
I, you know, I'm not near that. I
mean, I'm not nearly in the public eye,

2798
02:36:36,661 --> 02:36:38,940
say as you are. I wouldn't have
to face that level of scrutiny,

2799
02:36:38,941 --> 02:36:43,770
but certainly in my small way, yeah, of
course I can make a tweet, just a joke.

2800
02:36:43,800 --> 02:36:47,070
Oh, and people will be bombarding
you. Oh, I'm sure. Yeah.

2801
02:36:47,280 --> 02:36:52,280
Long searching and trying to find
psychological cracks in your armor.

2802
02:36:53,570 --> 02:36:55,980
I wrote something, I thought
it was funny. Go Fuck Yourself.

2803
02:36:55,981 --> 02:36:57,840
Think about it for more than like,
you know what I mean?

2804
02:36:57,841 --> 02:37:01,590
But at the same point also, you don't
recant and be like, oh, well Geez,

2805
02:37:01,591 --> 02:37:04,260
I better change things because I wrote,
wrote,

2806
02:37:04,280 --> 02:37:07,390
um, just, I, I watched this woman,

2807
02:37:07,450 --> 02:37:11,140
she was on a date and she was talking
about how much she hates children.

2808
02:37:11,590 --> 02:37:16,100
And I wrote on Twitter that I view
women who don't like kids the same

2809
02:37:16,100 --> 02:37:21,100
way I would viewed dogs. I like
to eat their own shit and uh,

2810
02:37:21,230 --> 02:37:24,560
obviously got a reaction, which leaves
a lot of room for interpretation.

2811
02:37:25,190 --> 02:37:29,810
But this kind of wrote a whole blog
about all that. I only view women as,

2812
02:37:29,811 --> 02:37:33,110
you know,
being there to have children getting this,

2813
02:37:34,280 --> 02:37:36,890
I fucked up. I should have said
hate instead of don't like,

2814
02:37:37,250 --> 02:37:40,400
I was trying to be nice.
She should have been more definitive.

2815
02:37:41,150 --> 02:37:44,750
It was just based on one particular
and just this weird thing that I,

2816
02:37:44,840 --> 02:37:47,690
women who don't like kids
like, oh, get that kid away.

2817
02:37:47,840 --> 02:37:51,780
There's something gross about them.
I just, it's a weird thing. I've,

2818
02:37:51,890 --> 02:37:56,750
I find it very, uh, not just distasteful.

2819
02:37:56,810 --> 02:37:59,480
It's a weird way. Like
it's, it's disturbing.

2820
02:37:59,481 --> 02:38:03,710
It repels me when people like,
especially for whatever reason,

2821
02:38:03,711 --> 02:38:06,770
women hate, well love men
too. Now that I have kids,

2822
02:38:06,771 --> 02:38:10,220
I see a man who doesn't like kids who
hates kids and you think about all the

2823
02:38:10,221 --> 02:38:14,960
abuse that some children suffer a lot
of times because of people like that,

2824
02:38:15,170 --> 02:38:18,110
that hate kids, it becomes
very, uh, disturbing to you,

2825
02:38:18,590 --> 02:38:21,350
especially when you have kids of your own.
I'm,

2826
02:38:21,430 --> 02:38:24,470
I'm totally fine with like I have
friends who just don't want to have kids.

2827
02:38:24,500 --> 02:38:26,730
That's a different thing.
Totally. They're just like, we,

2828
02:38:26,770 --> 02:38:30,080
we want to be able to travel
and leverage that. I mean, yeah.

2829
02:38:30,110 --> 02:38:34,190
So do I love my son and I
know you love your kids too,

2830
02:38:34,191 --> 02:38:35,890
but um,
you know,

2831
02:38:35,900 --> 02:38:38,720
there's some points where me and my wife
looked at each other where, you know,

2832
02:38:38,721 --> 02:38:40,940
I mean, I don't know if you
had good sleepers but me,

2833
02:38:40,941 --> 02:38:44,180
it's like our kids a toddler now and
he's still doesn't sleep well, but man,

2834
02:38:44,181 --> 02:38:46,850
there were times like four o'clock
in the morning when he hadn't slept.

2835
02:38:46,851 --> 02:38:48,080
And I feel like I was just like,

2836
02:38:48,380 --> 02:38:51,440
there was some hellish fourth dimension
that it opened up that I was staring

2837
02:38:51,441 --> 02:38:53,690
straight into. And I just think, I think,

2838
02:38:54,290 --> 02:38:57,860
but then that's part of the rites of
passage of, of you, of you being a parent.

2839
02:38:57,950 --> 02:39:00,860
But if there's someone said,
I want to, anything to do
with that, I'm like, I don't,

2840
02:39:00,890 --> 02:39:04,040
I don't blame you man. Yeah, sure.
Go ahead. Take a pass on this one.

2841
02:39:04,400 --> 02:39:08,660
We definitely went through periods
where you didn't sleep, but I don't,

2842
02:39:08,690 --> 02:39:12,710
I just don't think there's anything cool
about shaming people that don't want to

2843
02:39:12,711 --> 02:39:16,910
have children. Oh No, there's, there's
people that feel like that if you,

2844
02:39:16,911 --> 02:39:21,830
if they have children, you know, there's
something special above and beyond.

2845
02:39:21,831 --> 02:39:24,660
A person doesn't have children. Like
you're never going to get it. You didn't,

2846
02:39:24,661 --> 02:39:27,680
didn't even grow up [inaudible]
side of it. Like, oh,

2847
02:39:27,681 --> 02:39:31,100
you really couldn't possibly understand
what, what we're talking about here.

2848
02:39:31,101 --> 02:39:34,680
So it's like, oh, play. This guy said
this to me once. This guy who was a, uh,

2849
02:39:34,840 --> 02:39:38,870
just a crazy man, he was a
fascinating dude, but he had kids,

2850
02:39:39,170 --> 02:39:42,400
they were all grown and uh,
one of them had been in and out of jail.

2851
02:39:42,410 --> 02:39:44,640
The other one smoked crack. And, uh,

2852
02:39:44,690 --> 02:39:49,010
he was mocking this guy who was this
musician friend of mine who was in his

2853
02:39:49,010 --> 02:39:52,310
fifties. He's like, I feel bad for
him. He's never had children. I said,

2854
02:39:52,311 --> 02:39:53,330
why do you feel bad for him?
He goes,

2855
02:39:53,570 --> 02:39:56,990
because he never figured out what life is
all about. Light procreating. I'm like,

2856
02:39:57,230 --> 02:40:00,620
you made criminals.
One of your kids or that do you?

2857
02:40:00,621 --> 02:40:03,530
No one smokes crack criminals.

2858
02:40:03,890 --> 02:40:06,890
Criminals are fucking dangerous.
They are in the morning I leave.

2859
02:40:06,891 --> 02:40:11,150
They haven't contributed anything to
the forwarding of, of, of our species,

2860
02:40:11,190 --> 02:40:14,700
but in his mind,
sure he was better.

2861
02:40:14,910 --> 02:40:19,650
He was better because he shot a live
round, do a woman. She shit out of kid.

2862
02:40:20,190 --> 02:40:21,390
Amazing.
Isn't it?

2863
02:40:21,490 --> 02:40:26,490
Now does that holier than thou moral high
ground that some people take when they

2864
02:40:26,551 --> 02:40:27,460
have children and I do.

2865
02:40:28,080 --> 02:40:32,850
You can contribute in amazing amounts
of society without ever having a child.

2866
02:40:32,880 --> 02:40:36,480
I think just as much.
It's a different sort of contribution.

2867
02:40:36,630 --> 02:40:38,190
There's nothing wrong with it.
And I,

2868
02:40:38,790 --> 02:40:41,850
I have a lot of friends that don't ever
want to have kids and they're great

2869
02:40:41,851 --> 02:40:46,260
people and I love them dearly. They love
you. You know what I mean? They love kids.

2870
02:40:46,660 --> 02:40:50,580
That's your thing. It's like
people who just, I hate kids.

2871
02:40:50,610 --> 02:40:53,220
I hate the idea of kids.
I don't like seeing them on airplanes.

2872
02:40:53,221 --> 02:40:56,430
I don't look like them in my airspace in
any way, shape or form is, first of all,

2873
02:40:56,450 --> 02:41:00,030
it's like go live under a rock because
I'm not not taking my kid out into the

2874
02:41:00,031 --> 02:41:03,000
sunlight because your don't like
them nearby. Are you a person?

2875
02:41:03,001 --> 02:41:05,370
Do you like people? Yeah. Well what do
you, how do you think they came from?

2876
02:41:05,371 --> 02:41:10,200
They come to see somebody make a
storage bin to existence as you know,

2877
02:41:10,201 --> 02:41:13,950
18 year olds or something. Yeah.
I just, for whatever reason,

2878
02:41:13,980 --> 02:41:18,980
I just think that there's some people
out there that can't make that connection

2879
02:41:20,041 --> 02:41:22,980
that like, oh, it's a baby
and the baby becomes an adult.

2880
02:41:23,310 --> 02:41:26,370
I certainly get it a lot
more now that I've had kids.

2881
02:41:26,760 --> 02:41:30,420
Like I like babies, like I see
babies. I think they're cute.

2882
02:41:30,450 --> 02:41:33,180
When I used to see babies before
I had kids, I was like, oh,

2883
02:41:33,181 --> 02:41:35,190
that fucking thing is going to start
screaming and I got to get out of here,

2884
02:41:35,400 --> 02:41:38,820
but I never hated him. No, no, exactly.
Yeah. People that do hate them,

2885
02:41:38,910 --> 02:41:41,900
I find them very disturbing.
And you have actually had people,

2886
02:41:42,110 --> 02:41:45,510
I'm wondering if I've ever run into
someone who like basically has said point

2887
02:41:45,511 --> 02:41:50,480
blank, I hate kids. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah. There was a girl I dated.

2888
02:41:50,500 --> 02:41:55,370
He say that just that I
hate kids around them. They,

2889
02:41:55,380 --> 02:41:59,520
they, they always want too much
attention. I was like, wow.

2890
02:42:01,610 --> 02:42:05,310
I mean, and data for law. But she was,
she was angry about a lot of shit.

2891
02:42:05,490 --> 02:42:07,880
I think her parents were
alcoholics to over think.

2892
02:42:07,881 --> 02:42:12,420
It might've been a little bit of that. She
just, I don't know. Who knows? Who knows?

2893
02:42:12,421 --> 02:42:15,060
Who does know. Yeah. But I, but
I, I've, I've never heard it,

2894
02:42:15,061 --> 02:42:19,290
but I've have had people who are pretty
close to intolerance on that level as

2895
02:42:19,291 --> 02:42:23,070
well, you know? Um, and uh, and
I don't, I don't get it either.

2896
02:42:23,071 --> 02:42:24,390
And I certainly before I had kids,
yeah,

2897
02:42:24,391 --> 02:42:26,400
I'm more comfortable with
them now and I'm more,

2898
02:42:26,401 --> 02:42:30,150
I'm more like sympathetic towards other
people who are struggling with their kid

2899
02:42:30,151 --> 02:42:33,720
out in public. I'm like, Oh fuck. It's too
fine to, that is, you're more comfortable.

2900
02:42:33,721 --> 02:42:37,710
Just as a human being in life, you have
some success under your belt. You're not,

2901
02:42:38,640 --> 02:42:42,750
I mean, even though there is no
ultimate comfort, because look,

2902
02:42:42,751 --> 02:42:46,350
we're finite creatures on a finite planet,
finite solar system,

2903
02:42:46,351 --> 02:42:49,620
and if you don't live in the moment,
you're a fool because there,

2904
02:42:49,650 --> 02:42:52,860
there really is no tomorrow are crumbling.
Edifice is,

2905
02:42:53,310 --> 02:42:56,280
it's only as good as it is today and it's
not going to be as good tomorrow as it

2906
02:42:56,281 --> 02:43:01,170
was today. So Apollo creed in
rocky two nailed it. Or three,

2907
02:43:01,920 --> 02:43:05,610
three, four. Which one was that? There
is no tomorrow. Hmm. I'm just trying to,

2908
02:43:05,611 --> 02:43:08,730
I think he's threatened
by Mr too. Yeah, no,

2909
02:43:08,731 --> 02:43:12,660
he dies and full it for the
Russian. The Russian driver. Yes.

2910
02:43:12,670 --> 02:43:16,100
That's the rocky three doesn't want to
train. He's like, well, during the moral,

2911
02:43:16,780 --> 02:43:17,613
no,
tomorrow.

2912
02:43:19,500 --> 02:43:23,220
Tomorrow when he teaches him how to fight
like a black guy. Yeah, that's right.

2913
02:43:23,221 --> 02:43:26,280
I do remember that. Yes. Rocky three
but he's right. There is no tomorrow.

2914
02:43:26,460 --> 02:43:29,640
There's now and now goes on for long time.
But it doesn't go on forever.

2915
02:43:29,860 --> 02:43:32,300
The only reason why you think it's
tomorrow's because the earth is spinning.

2916
02:43:32,640 --> 02:43:36,010
You can mark it as tomorrow if you
really, you really into that. Oh yeah,

2917
02:43:36,150 --> 02:43:38,460
the winter definitely does come,
but there's no tomorrow.

2918
02:43:38,490 --> 02:43:40,650
So it's just this is this time.
You know what I mean?

2919
02:43:40,651 --> 02:43:44,160
We have a way of measuring it, but it's
really ultimately quite fruitless. Yeah,

2920
02:43:44,850 --> 02:43:45,540
I agree.

2921
02:43:45,540 --> 02:43:50,540
But there's something about it where it
becomes a completely overwhelming for

2922
02:43:50,941 --> 02:43:55,680
some people it did to defines their very
existence. You know, the passage of time,

2923
02:43:55,681 --> 02:44:00,000
the, I mean I wrote an article
for Esquire and it was about,

2924
02:44:00,060 --> 02:44:03,580
and you would have some knowledge of this
basically because it's, it's in MMA is,

2925
02:44:03,581 --> 02:44:07,260
is hormone replacement
therapy or testosterone TRT.

2926
02:44:07,710 --> 02:44:11,370
And um, and there's
this, there's this study,

2927
02:44:11,371 --> 02:44:15,420
it's called negligible senescence.
So senescence is what essence senescence.

2928
02:44:15,440 --> 02:44:19,890
Great, great, great. Word. Senescence
is, is what we're talking about.

2929
02:44:19,891 --> 02:44:24,600
Negligible Senescence,
n. E. S. C. E. N. C.

2930
02:44:24,600 --> 02:44:26,910
E I think.
And it's there,

2931
02:44:26,911 --> 02:44:30,840
it is negligible senescence and Senescence
is, is what you're talking about.

2932
02:44:30,841 --> 02:44:34,590
It's like our bodies just getting
older and things sort of slowly,

2933
02:44:34,591 --> 02:44:36,660
slowly crumbling and negligible.

2934
02:44:36,661 --> 02:44:41,160
Senescence is the study of creatures who
don't age the way that that humans do

2935
02:44:41,220 --> 02:44:44,140
like toward tortoises. That's right.
Exactly right. The digital Senescence,

2936
02:44:44,450 --> 02:44:47,180
you look up negligible senescence.
You see a turtle? Yup. That's right.

2937
02:44:47,181 --> 02:44:50,070
The look at the life to live.
It's shit. It is quite shit.

2938
02:44:50,210 --> 02:44:54,650
Yeah. Wander around. Fucking
birds pick their babies.

2939
02:44:54,651 --> 02:44:56,630
Have a fly off with them.
It's

2940
02:44:56,630 --> 02:44:59,720
perfect for a tortoise. The tortoise
doesn't know any different I guess,

2941
02:44:59,721 --> 02:45:01,010
but they did. They'd hate it. Yeah.

2942
02:45:01,011 --> 02:45:02,950
They would probably be
committing suicide those,

2943
02:45:02,951 --> 02:45:06,320
so they would be cutting their life
string short that way. But I think Wales,

2944
02:45:06,580 --> 02:45:09,990
certain whales have it. See
galls of all creatures. Muscles.

2945
02:45:10,020 --> 02:45:14,000
My fresh water pearl muscles live to be
250 years old and they don't and they

2946
02:45:14,001 --> 02:45:17,270
don't show this. That's the thing.
It's like a five year old muscle.

2947
02:45:17,580 --> 02:45:21,260
It acts the same as a 200 year old
woman. Must. How bout a cohort? A clam.

2948
02:45:21,560 --> 02:45:25,700
Do you know how old they get? No.
570 years old is the oldest one.

2949
02:45:25,701 --> 02:45:30,380
They found that old. Yup. I'd be
an enormous toward us 255 years.

2950
02:45:30,860 --> 02:45:34,520
Lobsters, a hundred plus years. Assumably
they don't really know until they get,

2951
02:45:34,521 --> 02:45:39,320
yeah. How about a hydro? Hydro is no,
it's kind of snake. Biologically immortal.

2952
02:45:39,740 --> 02:45:44,210
Biologically immortal. Immortal.
It's a genus of small, simple,

2953
02:45:44,211 --> 02:45:48,800
fresh water. Animals that
possess radial symmetry. A Hydra.

2954
02:45:48,890 --> 02:45:53,410
They're predatory animals belonging
to the phylum. Wow. Spell this.

2955
02:45:53,720 --> 02:45:57,380
C. N. I don't know why you'd put
a c and then it does not work.

2956
02:45:57,381 --> 02:46:02,210
Did you run out of vowels?
You Fuck? See, n I.

2957
02:46:02,211 --> 02:46:07,120
D a R.
I.

2958
02:46:07,120 --> 02:46:09,760
A S Darya and the class hydros.
Ah.

2959
02:46:10,070 --> 02:46:13,220
They can be found in most
unpolluted freshwater ponds,

2960
02:46:13,221 --> 02:46:17,690
lakes and streams in the temperate and
tropical regions and can be found gently

2961
02:46:17,691 --> 02:46:18,524
sweeping.

2962
02:46:19,190 --> 02:46:23,090
Oh by gently sweeping and
collecting net through weedy areas.

2963
02:46:23,120 --> 02:46:24,950
They are multicellular organisms,

2964
02:46:24,951 --> 02:46:29,270
which are usually a few meters long
and are best studied with a microscope,

2965
02:46:29,630 --> 02:46:34,460
but they are immortal. That's amazing.
What an interesting yeah. Phenomenon.

2966
02:46:34,461 --> 02:46:37,460
I never would've thought that enters
their lives. Shit. Yeah, that's the, yeah,

2967
02:46:37,461 --> 02:46:39,890
exactly. They're just a squiggle
around in the weeds. That's,

2968
02:46:40,160 --> 02:46:44,240
that's the punishment. Sorta be like,
hell yeah. It's like a reconstituted,

2969
02:46:44,241 --> 02:46:46,910
shitty child. Molesters become
hydras in their next life.

2970
02:46:48,740 --> 02:46:52,610
They just get swept up
and fucking dirty fish.

2971
02:46:53,490 --> 02:46:55,900
I'm not a mortal,
have a fishy to you.

2972
02:46:56,840 --> 02:47:00,650
But that started the idea of TRT is then
that the proponents say that, you know,

2973
02:47:00,651 --> 02:47:03,380
you're, you're, you're not going
to live forever. Of course,

2974
02:47:03,381 --> 02:47:07,670
that's not the body that we've been
gifted by, you know, by, by nature.

2975
02:47:07,880 --> 02:47:11,810
But you know, most when you talk to
guys, and I talked to guys. Yeah,

2976
02:47:11,811 --> 02:47:15,830
I used my father as, you know,
my dad's 65 now 66 and he's like,

2977
02:47:15,860 --> 02:47:18,980
I don't want to live forever.
Of course I just want to be able to be,

2978
02:47:19,550 --> 02:47:21,920
to carry groceries up
to my house when I'm 80.

2979
02:47:21,950 --> 02:47:24,770
I want to have that sort of quality
of life for as long as I can.

2980
02:47:24,771 --> 02:47:28,430
And then when that whole house comes down,
let it come down immediately.

2981
02:47:28,580 --> 02:47:31,580
You know what I mean? Well, that's
wishful thinking. It is quite honestly.

2982
02:47:31,970 --> 02:47:36,770
But you certainly can manipulate your
hormones to give you a decided advantage

2983
02:47:36,771 --> 02:47:38,420
over non manipulated people.

2984
02:47:38,421 --> 02:47:41,780
It becomes a real issue in mixed
martial arts because of course we, uh,

2985
02:47:41,810 --> 02:47:44,630
Brendan Schaub who a is on the podcast,

2986
02:47:44,631 --> 02:47:46,730
the fighter and the kid
with my friend Brian Cowen,

2987
02:47:47,030 --> 02:47:49,580
he's a fighter in the UFC and
he said it best and he said,

2988
02:47:49,581 --> 02:47:54,581
what's wrong with TRT when it comes to
competitive sports is that there's an

2989
02:47:54,591 --> 02:47:59,120
advantage of youth and
there's an advantage of wisdom
and wisdom comes with age

2990
02:47:59,121 --> 02:48:03,620
and with experience and with years and
years of study and practice and that,

2991
02:48:03,680 --> 02:48:08,570
that advantage sort of in some way
there's sort of a point of diminishing

2992
02:48:08,571 --> 02:48:11,720
returns where it cancels
out youth and experience,

2993
02:48:11,930 --> 02:48:16,930
whether it's at 35 or whether it's a
37 when does the tip back towards youth

2994
02:48:17,691 --> 02:48:21,380
again? Well, when you start supplementing
the hormones with testosterone,

2995
02:48:21,410 --> 02:48:24,770
it doesn't, and then you get guys
like Vito Bell for of course,

2996
02:48:25,100 --> 02:48:26,630
36 37 years old.

2997
02:48:26,631 --> 02:48:30,980
Fucking everybody up because they're got
muscles and the teeth now because he's

2998
02:48:30,981 --> 02:48:33,980
taking testosterone. What
about like Dan Henderson? See,

2999
02:48:33,981 --> 02:48:38,300
I feel like that's one where he's like
forced to go into like wars with guys who

3000
02:48:38,301 --> 02:48:42,890
are 15, even 20 years, his, his, uh,
younger than him and I feel like,

3001
02:48:43,880 --> 02:48:45,770
you know what I mean? But
that, but then you know,

3002
02:48:45,771 --> 02:48:49,040
people of the people that I grew up
watching as boxers didn't, you know,

3003
02:48:49,041 --> 02:48:52,190
you just had to keep throwing yourself
into that fray and if your body is

3004
02:48:52,191 --> 02:48:55,110
collapsing around you, that's the
choice that you've made. Well,

3005
02:48:55,111 --> 02:48:59,150
he's not on testosterone anymore
that it was abolished. It,

3006
02:48:59,480 --> 02:49:00,470
it's no longer allowed in the,

3007
02:49:00,471 --> 02:49:03,620
you are no longer alive and
most athletic commissions,

3008
02:49:03,621 --> 02:49:08,310
even worldwide have ceased. These
of it, Brazil stopped. So it becomes

3009
02:49:08,310 --> 02:49:09,900
really fucking interesting,

3010
02:49:09,901 --> 02:49:14,370
especially in Brazil because in Brazil
you can buy steroids and a lot of stores

3011
02:49:14,371 --> 02:49:16,140
you can buy them over
the counter like you can.

3012
02:49:16,141 --> 02:49:18,840
In Mexico you don't have
to have prescriptions.

3013
02:49:18,841 --> 02:49:21,780
I don't know if they've changed that in
Brazil. I know they have it in Mexico.

3014
02:49:21,781 --> 02:49:25,770
In Mexico, people go and buy like
fucking Viagara. They go by percosets.

3015
02:49:25,771 --> 02:49:29,220
They could buy all kinds of shit
down there. A lot. In a lot of ways,

3016
02:49:29,970 --> 02:49:33,510
but they just have different regulations
when it comes to pharmaceutical drugs

3017
02:49:33,511 --> 02:49:36,600
and, and, and, and steroids. Um,

3018
02:49:36,660 --> 02:49:40,890
but in the UFC you cannot
have testosterone replacement.

3019
02:49:40,920 --> 02:49:42,150
No one can have it anymore.

3020
02:49:42,480 --> 02:49:45,990
So it's really interesting also because
these people that have been taking it

3021
02:49:45,991 --> 02:49:49,290
for x amount of years,
they've depleted their system.

3022
02:49:49,650 --> 02:49:52,770
They've sort of shut their own
endogenous production down.

3023
02:49:53,640 --> 02:49:57,090
I think there's,
there's too many negatives to it.

3024
02:49:57,300 --> 02:50:00,300
There's too many negatives to it
as far as for athletic competition.

3025
02:50:00,301 --> 02:50:03,240
And one of the big ones is
I have a Dr. Mark Gordon,

3026
02:50:03,241 --> 02:50:07,200
who's a friend of mine who is a expert
on traumatic brain injury. And it says,

3027
02:50:07,201 --> 02:50:11,430
one of the big issues is you have to
find out what is it that's causing this

3028
02:50:11,431 --> 02:50:14,850
depletion of their natural source
of testosterone. Is it just old age?

3029
02:50:15,150 --> 02:50:16,770
Which is one possibility.

3030
02:50:16,950 --> 02:50:21,390
Another possibility is traumatic brain
injury and cutting their testosterone.

3031
02:50:21,450 --> 02:50:25,420
Absolutely. I never, well, he scared
the fuck out of me, man. His, uh,

3032
02:50:25,470 --> 02:50:29,630
his take on traumatic brain injury
is so studied and you know, he's,

3033
02:50:29,631 --> 02:50:34,340
he's been involved in assisting football
players and athletes of concussion.

3034
02:50:34,341 --> 02:50:37,020
Yeah. A lot of them
who have had, you know,

3035
02:50:37,021 --> 02:50:41,900
really dramatic changes because of head
trauma and the way he describes it,

3036
02:50:41,901 --> 02:50:44,370
it's like you never know what
it's going to be that does it.

3037
02:50:44,370 --> 02:50:47,640
It could be you go jet
skiing one day and you know,

3038
02:50:47,641 --> 02:50:51,510
just the bouncing on the water and
something's wrong and your brain and then

3039
02:50:51,511 --> 02:50:55,650
your body shuts down his testosterone,
your libido drops and you're not aware.

3040
02:50:55,930 --> 02:50:58,840
You just feel like you feel depressed.
The bottom dropped out of me or something.

3041
02:50:58,910 --> 02:51:01,710
And then you go to the
doctor, I'm depressed. They
put you on antidepressants.

3042
02:51:01,711 --> 02:51:02,544
I mean,
it's like,

3043
02:51:02,640 --> 02:51:06,570
and what he's finding is that the
pituitary gland is incredibly sensitive to

3044
02:51:06,571 --> 02:51:07,350
trauma.

3045
02:51:07,350 --> 02:51:12,350
And so obviously that when you're dealing
with a sport that one of the big goals

3046
02:51:13,231 --> 02:51:17,460
is to shut the brain down with
impacts, you know, with, with, uh,

3047
02:51:17,550 --> 02:51:18,383
a strike,

3048
02:51:19,080 --> 02:51:24,080
like giving them testosterone so that
it negates the effects of brain trauma.

3049
02:51:24,900 --> 02:51:28,290
Sort of like just masks the
real issue that's going on.

3050
02:51:28,560 --> 02:51:33,420
So it's not as simple as
their body getting older and
they need testosterone to

3051
02:51:33,421 --> 02:51:35,100
live in a nice quality of life.

3052
02:51:35,460 --> 02:51:40,460
It's a matter of medication that
sort of overrides this issue where,

3053
02:51:40,651 --> 02:51:45,240
you know, they're getting, they're getting
their brain fuck. Yeah. Yeah. So I think,

3054
02:51:45,241 --> 02:51:49,770
uh, and I also think it's too many. It's
too much possibility of cheating. Yeah.

3055
02:51:49,771 --> 02:51:53,940
I think there's that too.
I mean, I interviewed, um,
what's it, Keith Kaiser. Yes.

3056
02:51:54,570 --> 02:51:58,890
And he said that basically said the same
thing. It's just not. Um, and you know,

3057
02:51:58,891 --> 02:52:02,340
of course my editor wanted me to look
at the sports side of a thing and I did.

3058
02:52:02,341 --> 02:52:04,290
And I think there were some
really interesting stuff to be,

3059
02:52:04,350 --> 02:52:06,100
to be found on that side of it.
And I come down on,

3060
02:52:06,100 --> 02:52:07,150
on your side too.
I mean,

3061
02:52:07,151 --> 02:52:11,860
just like we've been having combat sport
events since Greek and Roman times.

3062
02:52:12,210 --> 02:52:16,060
Um, yeah. I mean, of course you don't want
to, some people would say, well listen,

3063
02:52:16,061 --> 02:52:20,890
we also fix MCL and ACL is, and we're
able to do great things with medicine. So,

3064
02:52:21,610 --> 02:52:23,710
you know what I mean?
Like why not take the advancement,

3065
02:52:23,711 --> 02:52:28,170
these benefits that we have and
if TRT is one of them, but I,

3066
02:52:28,200 --> 02:52:31,210
but I do think there's, there's the
fairness to the sport, but when I just,

3067
02:52:31,211 --> 02:52:32,110
before I left the hotel,

3068
02:52:32,111 --> 02:52:35,260
I saw commercial where it's like an
underarm now you just go in the morning,

3069
02:52:35,270 --> 02:52:37,510
you just swipe it on and
you had about your day.

3070
02:52:37,511 --> 02:52:41,890
So like just for not sports
taken out of it, just generally,

3071
02:52:42,220 --> 02:52:45,310
um, from my, what I've read
the research that I've done,

3072
02:52:45,311 --> 02:52:49,480
which was just in service of that
article, um, you know, I, I wouldn't,

3073
02:52:49,510 --> 02:52:53,620
I like I'm more or less said if my dad
wanted to use it, I would be like, listen,

3074
02:52:53,621 --> 02:52:58,270
if it works, uh, and if you try it,
you know what I mean? Uh, uh, you know,

3075
02:52:58,271 --> 02:53:00,730
and it makes some benefit to
your life. You know, I'd be like,

3076
02:53:00,731 --> 02:53:02,140
of course I'd be all for it.

3077
02:53:02,170 --> 02:53:05,470
It's really the tip of the iceberg when
it comes to manipulating the human.

3078
02:53:06,290 --> 02:53:10,750
This essentially a low level form of
genetic engineering and what you're going

3079
02:53:10,751 --> 02:53:14,500
to be able to do instead of introducing
these synthetic hormones into your

3080
02:53:14,501 --> 02:53:15,910
system,
which are going to be able to do,

3081
02:53:15,911 --> 02:53:20,480
is they're going to have nanobots that
repair tissue. They're going to have your,

3082
02:53:20,500 --> 02:53:24,250
your your body's ability to recuperate.
A lot of people don't understand what,

3083
02:53:24,280 --> 02:53:25,890
what hormones do and the,

3084
02:53:25,891 --> 02:53:29,590
the various different roles
that they play on your body,

3085
02:53:29,591 --> 02:53:33,740
but a hormone doesn't necessarily make
you bigger. What makes you bigger is it,

3086
02:53:33,790 --> 02:53:38,020
it makes you, when you take testosterone,
it makes you recover quicker.

3087
02:53:38,380 --> 02:53:43,090
And one of the ways guys can cheat is
that they can work harder and they can put

3088
02:53:43,091 --> 02:53:47,200
in more time because the recovery
is shorter because they take these,

3089
02:53:47,201 --> 02:53:52,201
these hormones and they can put in these
intense and insane sessions in the gym

3090
02:53:52,391 --> 02:53:54,310
and they'll be fresh as
a daisy in the morning,

3091
02:53:54,640 --> 02:53:57,520
whereas the other person has to sort of
will themselves to get up and through

3092
02:53:57,521 --> 02:54:02,350
hard work and determination can really
put in the time and get better the

3093
02:54:02,351 --> 02:54:07,330
traditional way. Um, so that, that's,
that's considered cheating. I agree.

3094
02:54:07,420 --> 02:54:07,780
Yeah.

3095
02:54:07,780 --> 02:54:12,780
But one day they're going to have fucking
male men who are on these nanobots.

3096
02:54:13,330 --> 02:54:17,100
That's right. Some form of genetic
[inaudible] man for 300 years,

3097
02:54:17,110 --> 02:54:19,570
cause he just keeps reject. That's
another thing I did. There's a guy,

3098
02:54:19,571 --> 02:54:21,870
Aubrey de grey. Yes. I
know that guy. Right. Okay.

3099
02:54:21,880 --> 02:54:25,750
So he basically just says that your whole
body can be replaced slow. And he says,

3100
02:54:25,751 --> 02:54:27,100
look at it like a car.
Yeah.

3101
02:54:27,340 --> 02:54:30,670
But I feel like there was some part of
me that thought just as a fiction writer,

3102
02:54:30,671 --> 02:54:33,670
like I don't know if I'd want
to see a 2000 year old person.

3103
02:54:33,940 --> 02:54:37,950
They smell like they smell.
They had like like old papery flesh shirt,

3104
02:54:38,160 --> 02:54:40,810
hot as fuck. What do they look
like? John Jamison in their prime,

3105
02:54:40,811 --> 02:54:44,800
but they smell like Barbara Walters so
you couldn't get rid of the century.

3106
02:54:44,801 --> 02:54:48,340
Kind of a would just be too,
too weird. Yeah, we're going to,

3107
02:54:48,341 --> 02:54:49,174
we're running out of time,

3108
02:54:49,250 --> 02:54:52,200
but that wouldn't be something that you
would really have to think about, man.

3109
02:54:52,201 --> 02:54:55,840
It was. If you get, if we get to a
pert, a point where people are a mortal,

3110
02:54:56,080 --> 02:54:59,860
there's going to be that thing
where they're like, they go, what's,

3111
02:54:59,890 --> 02:55:02,980
is there a next?
Should I just let this die off?

3112
02:55:02,990 --> 02:55:06,590
And there's going to be people that do
decide to just keep going and going,

3113
02:55:06,591 --> 02:55:10,960
but I feel like you'd lose all your
family and friends and all. Yeah.

3114
02:55:10,970 --> 02:55:14,300
You're all 2000 year old. You get annoyed
with each other for eternity. Yeah,

3115
02:55:14,301 --> 02:55:18,200
exactly. Listen, man, this is
a fascinating conversation.
I really enjoyed it.

3116
02:55:18,230 --> 02:55:20,360
Thank you very much. Let me know
when you're new book comes out.

3117
02:55:20,361 --> 02:55:22,340
What is it called again?
The deep. The dean. Yeah.

3118
02:55:22,430 --> 02:55:24,680
It's just like that movie
with Nick naulty. It is. Yeah.

3119
02:55:24,681 --> 02:55:28,220
Though the title's been used before,
but it's a different thing. All, well,

3120
02:55:28,221 --> 02:55:31,640
not entirely, but there's differences
and a, when can I get a copy of that?

3121
02:55:31,880 --> 02:55:34,020
I will make sure, wait, what
do you mean at the time?

3122
02:55:34,730 --> 02:55:39,080
Let's say six months at the most.
Six months from now. Mark it down.

3123
02:55:39,560 --> 02:55:41,720
All right. Thank you brother. It
was a lot of fun. No, my pleasure.

3124
02:55:41,721 --> 02:55:45,650
Thank you very much.
The book is called the troop and uh,

3125
02:55:45,680 --> 02:55:50,450
his name is not really nick cutter.
His name is Craig Davidson.

3126
02:55:50,451 --> 02:55:55,430
So if you like nick cutters work two t's,
why'd you go with two t's?

3127
02:55:56,570 --> 02:55:59,960
Because my agent cuter.
Yeah,

3128
02:56:00,020 --> 02:56:03,770
that would do that worked in a different
way. Yeah. Is unique near Nate.

3129
02:56:03,780 --> 02:56:06,680
Your agent came up with nick cutters. They
both came up with, oh, he thought like,

3130
02:56:06,710 --> 02:56:10,090
oh, they need to have like a hard
driving kind of like nick, you know,

3131
02:56:10,360 --> 02:56:14,900
shutter Bob Slasher. That's
right. My name's Nick Gutter.

3132
02:56:16,890 --> 02:56:21,770
My Bros, no filters. I cut him
off and I spit them liberals.
All right, thanks dude.

3133
02:56:21,830 --> 02:56:22,950
A lot of fun by the book.

3134
02:56:23,460 --> 02:56:27,140
It's available right now on amazon.com
but you will not get this covered.

3135
02:56:27,500 --> 02:56:30,620
Do you have an audio book version? An
audio book version as well? Uh Huh.
