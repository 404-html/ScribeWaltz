1
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,320
If you hear those clicks, that's
me typing. Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,020
I'm not the fastest typer in the world.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,233
I get it done.

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:17,510
Uh, this episode of the podcast
is brought to you by blue apron.

5
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:22,580
Blue Apron is one of my newest and most
favoritest. That's not a real word.

6
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,040
Um,
sponsors because would essentially is,

7
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:30,140
is they send you all the ingredients
for healthy meals and you cook them

8
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:34,610
yourself by their directions,
uh, with their recipes. Uh,

9
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,710
all the portions are measured out
perfectly along with spices and a detailed

10
00:00:40,161 --> 00:00:44,100
photographs that show you
what to do and uh, all the,

11
00:00:44,101 --> 00:00:45,800
the various parts of the recipe.

12
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:49,730
It's really interesting and it's kind of
fun too cause cooking, you know, if you,

13
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,900
if you get like a recipe book and
then you have to go to the store,

14
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,630
you have to buy the
individual ingredients,

15
00:00:56,631 --> 00:01:01,070
you have to measure them and weigh them
and all that stuff that that's a lot of

16
00:01:01,071 --> 00:01:02,000
extra work.

17
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:06,800
That blue apron sort of cuts out and
they also provide you with a wide variety

18
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:11,030
of different meals to choose from, which
makes it, which makes it interesting.

19
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:15,560
It becomes like a little bit of a project,
which I think is fun. Um, but really,

20
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:20,520
really yummy foods like coconut
curry, salmon steaks, um,

21
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:24,530
Swedish meatballs with braise,
Kale, stuffed cabbage rolls.

22
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,180
I've eaten several meals from them so far.
They,

23
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:31,400
there the amount of calories that
you get from these meals. Also, it's,

24
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,550
it's pretty surprising.
It's 500 or 700 calories.

25
00:01:34,551 --> 00:01:37,790
It's just very low for a really yummy,
delicious foods,

26
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:42,791
but they're all prepared and designed
by people who really know how to make

27
00:01:44,151 --> 00:01:48,560
Yummy, delicious food. Uh, it's not
hard to do. I'm not a great, great chef,

28
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:53,280
obviously. Did I have to say that?
It's like saying I'm not a doctor. Uh,

29
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,920
I'm not a great cook. I know how to cook
a few things, but this blue apron thing,

30
00:01:57,921 --> 00:02:00,980
I find it fun. I find it like a
little bit of a project. You know,

31
00:02:00,981 --> 00:02:03,050
it's a lot cheaper than ordering out.

32
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,920
You can get everything is
$9 and 99 cents per meal.

33
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,540
That's all the ingredients in the exact
right proportions with simple recipe

34
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:15,170
instructions right to your door.
And like I said,

35
00:02:15,171 --> 00:02:18,770
there's a wide variety of things that
they're going to send you and things to

36
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:22,730
choose from. It's really delicious. It's
very healthy for you. Incredible meals.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,030
And uh, I think you'll be blown away
by the quality and the freshness.

38
00:02:26,031 --> 00:02:28,190
All of it comes in like this.

39
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:33,050
A Styrofoam container all sealed up with
ice bags. It's a w whatever they use.

40
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,910
Ice Packs, frozen things, dry eyes.
So what it is, yeah, I'll let shit,

41
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:42,080
whatever the stuff they use to keep it
from rotting. That's what it really is.

42
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,101
But it's delicious.

43
00:02:43,101 --> 00:02:47,450

You can handle it all online and everybody
knows that anytime you have to deal

50
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:19,120
with any office where you have to
make an appointment and go there,

51
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,820
that's a huge pain in the ass.
You have to take time off work.

52
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,790
You have to figure out how to get
there during normal business hours.

53
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,950
There's a lot of things that people

56
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:41,260
like for the longest time, like there's
so many different parts of our society,

57
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:46,420
of our civilized world that you would
have to go and talk to an expert,

58
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,980
make an appointment, spend an exorbitant
amount, exorbitant amount of money,

59
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,400
paying this expert to deal with Shit you
could do with all sorts of legal things

60
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,940
on your own, like a power of
attorney, get a will, living trusts,

61
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:06,070
forming an LLC, all that stuff.
It's super easy to do on legal zoom.

62
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:10,390
Legal Zoom also has an a plus from
the better business bureau, which is,

63
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:14,050
it's a huge relief if you're dealing
with some sort of me like what are they

64
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:17,980
doing? They're fucking, what are they
doing? They're legal help online.

65
00:04:17,981 --> 00:04:20,410
What it sounds like it could be shady.

66
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,450
Legal Zoom has helped tons of people.
We know so many people that have used it.

67
00:04:25,451 --> 00:04:30,130
It was originally used to start on
it. Uh, Brian used it to form a desk,

68
00:04:30,131 --> 00:04:33,270
squad.tv. The LLC for that. Um,

69
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:37,240
Tom Segura and Christina Palicki,
I think they use it too.

70
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:42,540
It's really easy to do any more on who
knows how to just fill out forms can do

71
00:04:42,971 --> 00:04:46,870
it. And if you get into a
panic while you're doing it,

72
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,580
they can connect you with a third party
attorney. Legal Zoom is not a law firm,

73
00:04:51,581 --> 00:04:55,870
but they provide you with self help,
legal services at your specific direction.

74
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,170
And like I said, if things feel
like they're going horribly wrong,

75
00:04:59,171 --> 00:05:01,690
legal zoom can connect you
with a third party attorney.

76
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,590
It's super easy to deal with
ladies and gentlemen. And very,

77
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:09,250
very economical as well.
And for a special savings,

78
00:05:09,251 --> 00:05:12,910
be sure to enter Rogan in
the referral box at checkout.

79
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,320
So go to legal zoom.com you can even
get divorced. How about them apples?

80
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,660
And probably not though.
Let's be honest,

81
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,410
most of the time when people are getting
divorced, there's like a little, there's,

82
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,130
there's a little gamesmanship going
on. But if you are, if you're amicable,

83
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,920
if you'd both look at each other and go,
let's just fucking end this.

84
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:33,670
You'd go to legalzoom.com and
take care of it anyway. Go there.

85
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:38,410
Use the Codeword Rogan in the referral
box at checkout and save yourself some

86
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:43,340
money. That's legalzoom.com. Do
you like my new song? Very good.

87
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:48,220
Thank you. Yeah, don't
use that legal zoom.

88
00:05:48,221 --> 00:05:49,810
I'll write a better one for you anyway.

89
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,520
Emily and Vincent are here from Buddhist
Geeks and uh, let's just get cracking.

90
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,320
I fuck around legal zoom.com
musical were Brogan.

91
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,563
Okay.

92
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,783
Experience.

93
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:11,430
I got to figure out a better way to do
commercials cause it's always weird with

94
00:06:11,431 --> 00:06:13,540
two, two people at a three
or just sitting there

95
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,960
and one person is talking
to doing a bunch of money.

96
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,070
It creates an uncomfortable air in the
room. I'm all right a little bit. Right.

97
00:06:20,071 --> 00:06:22,980
It's a little odd. Um, Buddhist Geeks,

98
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,430
somebody sent me a link,

99
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:29,460
I guess it was probably a couple of
weeks ago on Twitter to you guys.

100
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,550
And right away I went, oh,
this could be interesting.

101
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,660
A convergence of what'd you say?
Spirituality,

102
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,910
Buddhism and technology.

103
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,940
That's what you see and Geeks which
always is somehow are connected with um,

104
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,760
impairment and vision, which
is very strange, right?

105
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,630
Like being very studious and intelligent
is connected to your eyes are fucked.

106
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:55,560
Like every, you know, I mean you're
looking at screens all day, I think.

107
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,330
Is that what it must be?
Right.

108
00:06:57,331 --> 00:06:59,400
Because as I've spent more
time in front of a computer,

109
00:06:59,401 --> 00:07:03,450
my eyes have steadily gotten
worse. Um, but your, your image,

110
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,790
the logo is the Buddha with glasses on.

111
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:10,770
So even the divine are not immune to
the perils of LCD screens. True enough.

112
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,190
Is there a better way
around this to, to, uh,

113
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:18,330
to do something where it doesn't
completely destroy your vision?

114
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:22,740
Maybe clairvoyants get developed
that capacity. That's the only way.

115
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,840
But reading does it too,
right?

116
00:07:24,841 --> 00:07:29,010
Cause we've always associated reading
with or is it just getting old and we're

117
00:07:29,011 --> 00:07:30,780
just blaming it on a bunch of other shit.

118
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:35,950
Could be that, but I, I think it's
staring at things up close. You know,

119
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,610
there's just,

120
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:39,740
I think the eyes just get used to staring
at things up close and then they can

121
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,200
just can't see far away anymore.
That's my theory with me.

122
00:07:42,201 --> 00:07:46,040
It's the opposite though. My up close
vision is starting to suck my, my vision,

123
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:49,010
like looking at you guys at this
distance is fine. It's perfect.

124
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,770
That might be age then.
Yeah,

125
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,940
taking the age because also because
when I put on reading glasses, um,

126
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,080
things just get sharper. I'm like, oh,
that's what things really looked like.

127
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,780
You know? Like, I could read
everything without the glasses,

128
00:07:59,781 --> 00:08:03,260
but then when I put them on and see like
the, like if you know, you look at pages,

129
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:07,160
you can see the actual detail,
the texture and the paper itself.

130
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,340
That's all gone to me.
That's all gone in the real world.

131
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,880
What is Buddhist Geeks?
What are you guys doing?

132
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:19,370
Well, we started, um, several years ago
as a podcast doing this kind of thing,

133
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,220
talking to people and I'm really,

134
00:08:22,221 --> 00:08:26,690
in the beginning it was just my sort
of early twenties rebellion against the

135
00:08:26,691 --> 00:08:27,590
Buddhist tradition.

136
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:33,050
And I wanted to talk to people that
weren't part of the mainstream Buddhist

137
00:08:33,051 --> 00:08:35,510
world, but had something
cool to say. I thought.

138
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,050
So we've just basically started by
talking to some different rebels,

139
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,080
a lot of Gen Xers who
are kind of coming up as,

140
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,670
as teachers and um,
meditation experts are masters.

141
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:51,320
And it sort of started there just
as a kind of whim project, uh,

142
00:08:51,321 --> 00:08:54,830
with a couple of friends
and then people responded.

143
00:08:54,831 --> 00:08:58,830
So he kept doing it and we felt a sort
of obligation to continue exploring

144
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:02,880
Buddhism, technology, culture,
the way it's globalizing.

145
00:09:02,881 --> 00:09:06,480
And we just sort of from there, I've just
been on a sort of eight year odyssey,

146
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,930
uh, and Emily recently,
about four years ago,

147
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:14,490
kind of join the team and we have visited
in the mom and pop thinks and I love

148
00:09:14,491 --> 00:09:18,450
it. I love that that Buddhism
has rebels. Absolutely.

149
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:22,890
What is the main,
what the main thing that people fight,

150
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:26,730
not fight against but rebel
against with Buddhism?

151
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,550
I think it's like most religions,
you know,

152
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:33,930
there's some aspect of just rebelling
against people telling you what to do or,

153
00:09:33,931 --> 00:09:35,340
or the feeling that,
you know,

154
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:39,720
this system of beliefs is telling you
how to live or what to do with your life.

155
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:44,970
I think that's part of it is just kind
of breaking apart dogmatic structures and

156
00:09:44,971 --> 00:09:45,870
sort of saying,
hey,

157
00:09:45,871 --> 00:09:50,310
actually we can make this our own and
figure out how to do it ourselves because

158
00:09:50,311 --> 00:09:51,720
we're the ones that are interested in it.

159
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:55,350
So we have to sort of take ownership
of that. And so there's a bit of like,

160
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,380
I guess generational pushback, you
know what I'm saying? Actually,

161
00:09:58,381 --> 00:10:00,420
we don't want to meditate like
the hippies dead, you know,

162
00:10:00,421 --> 00:10:03,290
we don't want Lotus flowers and incense,
you know,

163
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,270
we want like our computer screens
and meditation apps. You know,

164
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:08,370
we want to do it the way
it makes sense to us.

165
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:13,740
What is that an effective way to do
it? Like Meditation Apps? Is that real?

166
00:10:13,741 --> 00:10:17,850
Is that legit? Are there like
some recommended meditation apps?

167
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,810
They was better than traditional forms
or an alternative I should say to

168
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,650
traditional forms of meditation. I think
there are, yeah, there's some good ones.

169
00:10:25,651 --> 00:10:26,850
I think they're good to start.

170
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,500
I mean as soon as you start really getting
into it though, then it's useful to,

171
00:10:31,501 --> 00:10:36,420
I think still meet space has the upper
hand over the APP space. Interesting.

172
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,550
Yeah. But I, I'd recommend beautified.

173
00:10:38,551 --> 00:10:41,160
That was one that Emily and
I contributed to. And it's a,

174
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,680
it's a modern mindfulness on the go APP.

175
00:10:43,681 --> 00:10:46,560
So it's sort of teaches you how
to meditate in different contexts.

176
00:10:46,561 --> 00:10:49,500
Like if you're at the gym or if
you're, you know, on the tube. Um,

177
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,750
you wrote one for working on the computer.
Yep.

178
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,640
Never heard a couple of her
working on the computer.

179
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,300
So it's really just about trying to bridge
like what we're doing already in our

180
00:10:57,301 --> 00:11:01,920
lives with a meditation practice and
these ancient traditions that have come

181
00:11:01,921 --> 00:11:02,590
down.

182
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:06,490
What do you, what is the APP for working
on the computer? What does that entail?

183
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:10,420
Beautifies the APP and then the
couple of meditations that I wrote,

184
00:11:10,421 --> 00:11:14,560
it's just simple things like I'm bringing
your attention to different kind of

185
00:11:14,561 --> 00:11:16,600
anchor points.
For example,

186
00:11:16,601 --> 00:11:21,330
you know we all usually have some sort
of touch screen mobile device and so you

187
00:11:21,331 --> 00:11:25,540
know, you can use your, use it to bring
your attention back as you swipe it,

188
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,940
you know, back and forth with your
finger. So it's just something, you know,

189
00:11:28,941 --> 00:11:31,630
it was very simple to
return to so that you know,

190
00:11:31,631 --> 00:11:34,750
consciousness and the mind can
start to just kind of settle so that

191
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,300
you're more aware and five being more
aware. It makes a lot of difference.

192
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,150
When you say more where you mean,
um,

193
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,870
cause a lot of people kind of scattered
there. They're all over the place.

194
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:50,450
And Dave took one minute.
They were on, you know,

195
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:54,310
all kinds of different apps. Do you
name one? Is Facebook the devil?

196
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,100
No, I do sometimes. Yeah.

197
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:03,850
There's no meditation in Facebook
though. Correct? Not yet. Not yet.

198
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,290
What I think Facebook's into it,

199
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:11,050
it's a fascination with
social interaction. Right?

200
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:14,070
That's what it is. It's just
this thing where, you know,

201
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:18,130
I read this piece was talking about
the origins of gossip and what, what,

202
00:12:18,131 --> 00:12:19,420
what gossip is all about,

203
00:12:19,421 --> 00:12:23,050
why so many people are into
celebrities and celebrity gossip,

204
00:12:23,051 --> 00:12:25,180
the Kim Kardashians stuff
and that kind of thing.

205
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:29,590
And the big thing being that our
culture doesn't have the same sort of

206
00:12:29,591 --> 00:12:34,591
communities that it once had these
tribal bonds that expanded from 50 to 150

207
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:38,730
people to cities of 30 million.
They're,

208
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:43,210
they're very confusing for our biology
apparently. Absolutely. And so, uh,

209
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:47,710
that's why people gravitate towards what
seems to be really a name like this,

210
00:12:47,711 --> 00:12:49,570
this, this pull towards, oh my God,

211
00:12:49,571 --> 00:12:52,840
she left him and he went up
with her and oh goodness.

212
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,480
You see those magazine covers,
you just want to grab them.

213
00:12:55,481 --> 00:12:58,480
And people who have no
part of your life at all.

214
00:12:58,481 --> 00:13:01,890
You shouldn't be caring about them even
remotely, but for whatever reason you're,

215
00:13:01,891 --> 00:13:05,230
you're compelled to do it.
This is a little bit of that
with the Facebook thing.

216
00:13:05,231 --> 00:13:08,410
Right. I totally agree. When I
read a great article that said,

217
00:13:08,411 --> 00:13:12,100
in some sense Facebook brought that
experience of living in a tribal village

218
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,780
back as a technology.

219
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:18,150
Marsha Mcluhan and his whole sort of
theory about every technology brings

220
00:13:18,151 --> 00:13:20,950
something back from the
past. Yeah. Mcluhan has,

221
00:13:20,951 --> 00:13:25,720
one of my favorite all time quotes is
that a human beings are the sex organs for

222
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:30,580
the machine world. Ooh, Ooh.
Yeah. That's the greatest ever,

223
00:13:30,581 --> 00:13:30,970
right?

224
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:35,290
That is one of the all time greatest
quick JBS Haldane ains not only does the

225
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:38,680
universe queerer than you suppose
it's queer than you can suppose.

226
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:42,910
That's my number one favorite,
but number two right up there.

227
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:48,370
Nice cause it is a, I mean McLuhan was
right. What are we doing? We're making,

228
00:13:48,371 --> 00:13:51,910
we're making computers and we keep
making better ones and we keep,

229
00:13:51,911 --> 00:13:56,410
we were essentially the evolutionary
device that that causes the,

230
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,080
the,

231
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,780
the things that we've created
to accelerate far quicker
and innovate far quicker

232
00:14:01,781 --> 00:14:06,610
than biology ever has a chance to.
And in the process, we're also,

233
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,600
it seemingly,

234
00:14:07,601 --> 00:14:12,601
at least on the verge of creating some
sort of an artificial biological life.

235
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,510
Some, whether it's biological, I mean,

236
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:22,120
I don't know what you call artificially
created cells that interact with each

237
00:14:22,121 --> 00:14:26,860
other the same way human cells do.
But we're pretty pretty God damn close.

238
00:14:26,861 --> 00:14:28,750
Whether it's a hundred years or 200 years,

239
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:32,860
pretty close to making artificial people.
And where's that coming from?

240
00:14:32,861 --> 00:14:37,090
It's coming from people. If they
are machines, biological machines,

241
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,620
McLuhan,
we'll be right.

242
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:43,720
And then a new life form will be
birthed out of our greasy little hands,

243
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,330
not ours, obviously. Yeah,
I think that's right.

244
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:51,980
I saw Elon Musk on Twitter a couple of
days ago, said, uh, increasingly looks

245
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,770
like we're going to be the biological
boot loaders for a digital super

246
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:56,604
intelligent.

247
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:00,470
Yeah, most likely there's a
bunch of people that don't
believe that's happening.

248
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,930
I read this interesting
article on Kurzweil.

249
00:15:02,931 --> 00:15:06,500
The guy was very critical of
Kurzweil and uh, he was, uh,

250
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:10,630
I think this guy is like sort of,
um,

251
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:14,300
he's a curmudgeon a bit.
He's an intelligent guy.

252
00:15:14,301 --> 00:15:19,301
But his criticism of Kurzweil was
basically a biological criticism of that.

253
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:23,140
Our understanding of the
human mind is already, uh,

254
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:28,180
it's fairly limited in terms of like
how the human mind processes various

255
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:33,430
hormones and neurotransmitters
and proteins and that are,

256
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:38,480
there's no way we'll be able to recreate
that because our ideas of human,

257
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,201
of the human mind,

258
00:15:39,201 --> 00:15:43,190
the biological mine are still constantly
evolving and changing and growing and

259
00:15:43,191 --> 00:15:45,980
that we're not really ready yet
to duplicate the human mind.

260
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,530
But my take on that was that we,

261
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:52,310
we don't have to duplicate the biological
functions of it to duplicate the

262
00:15:52,311 --> 00:15:57,311
actual functions of it is if they figured
out a way to make something that not

263
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,310
only mimics the memory banks or the,
the,

264
00:16:01,311 --> 00:16:03,290
the memory access of the human mind,

265
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:06,890
but is much better than it does it
in a completely different way and non

266
00:16:06,891 --> 00:16:07,850
biological way.

267
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:12,380
And they can figure out a way to download
intelligence or download consciousness

268
00:16:12,381 --> 00:16:17,030
or memories into that bank. Well,
we're not going to really need this,

269
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,420
this whole idea of cells and proteins.
And I mean that that is,

270
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,600
those are the components
of the biological machine.

271
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,980
But if we can make a
better version of that and,

272
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,980
and do it like some sort of a synthetic
version or some sort of an artificially

273
00:16:30,981 --> 00:16:31,761
created version,

274
00:16:31,761 --> 00:16:34,880
it doesn't seem to me that we're going
to need to know everything about the

275
00:16:34,881 --> 00:16:37,700
human mind in order to
recreate its processes. Right.

276
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,530
Does that make sense? I
mean, it makes sense. I, uh,

277
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:44,730
I feel like I'm not enough of a specialist
on artificial general intelligence to

278
00:16:44,731 --> 00:16:47,250
really know the different, the
problem is, I don't think anybody is,

279
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,930
I mean, there's a bunch of people
that are working really hard at it,

280
00:16:49,931 --> 00:16:52,760
but no one's ever done it. So if
you haven't done it, who's the hell?

281
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:55,090
How the fuck are you an expert?
I mean if,

282
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:58,620
if there's not an artificial
human being that is, um, you know,

283
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:03,400
state of the art version 7.0,
uh, capable of compassion,

284
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,870
understands its actions, hopefully
it will be, well, it has to be right.

285
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:11,030
Otherwise we're going terminator
style. That's right. Right.

286
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,540
That's the real question now.

287
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:16,510
Sort of like the way we did nuclear
power before we learned how to shut off

288
00:17:16,511 --> 00:17:17,770
nuclear power plants.

289
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:21,640
Like I hope they don't do that with
artificial intelligence. Like, wow,

290
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:23,800
let's just get this thing up and
running and then we'll figure it out.

291
00:17:23,801 --> 00:17:24,910
A way to give it emotions.

292
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,780
Mm. Yeah. No,

293
00:17:26,781 --> 00:17:30,530
I mean that's what scares me a little
with the AI stuff is that it's so much

294
00:17:30,531 --> 00:17:34,610
focused on the rational thought
process and yet, you know,

295
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,170
my experience of being human is that
that's barely part of my human experience.

296
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,180
Occasionally I'm rational,
I have thoughts,

297
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,890
but mostly I'm just like reacting to
things and emotional and, you know,

298
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:49,410
I don't even know what, what it's
running most of my processes. Yeah.

299
00:17:49,411 --> 00:17:50,130
That is an issue.

300
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:50,730
Right?

301
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:51,061
Yeah.

302
00:17:51,061 --> 00:17:55,800
And I think it's also interesting to
see just bringing a little bit of the

303
00:17:55,801 --> 00:18:00,420
feminine perspective and it's like,
I'm very conscious of like, you know,

304
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,280
childbirth and some of these pro,
you know,

305
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,270
natural things that are on my mind a lot.

306
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:10,470
And so thinking about merging
the technology or creating
some sort of artificial

307
00:18:10,471 --> 00:18:11,280
intelligence,

308
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,240
it seems to me that a lot of these
conversations start to navigate really

309
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:19,850
quickly towards getting out of
the body. And so I, you know,

310
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:24,150
wonder if there is some sort
of bridge between, you know,

311
00:18:24,151 --> 00:18:27,660
we're going to create something new. And
at the same time, like you were saying,

312
00:18:27,661 --> 00:18:31,410
like infusing that with wisdom and
compassion and some of these biological

313
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:33,570
processes. Are we ever really
going to get out of that?

314
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,630
I don't know that it's just an
underlying assumption a lot in these

315
00:18:36,631 --> 00:18:38,540
conversations that I think is interesting.

316
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,790
Yeah. It's fascinating because the, the,

317
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:46,560
the general idea of
the human body and the,

318
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,420
the needs of the body,

319
00:18:48,421 --> 00:18:52,290
whether they're the needs for food or
the need for the human touch of the need

320
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:54,750
for, uh, the need to breed,

321
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,980
all these different things will be
completely unnecessary if we're no longer

322
00:18:58,981 --> 00:19:03,000
biological and what,
what is causing war?

323
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,950
What is causing greed?

324
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:10,130
What is causing jealousy are these
ancient monkey ideas that are stuck in our

325
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:15,450
genetics, these mechanisms that have
sort of forced us into the future,

326
00:19:15,451 --> 00:19:18,570
that forced competition.
They forced us to cope and adapt.

327
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,860
They forced us to learn to
interact with each other. And this,

328
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:26,250
along the way we've
sort of developed this,

329
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:30,990
these methods for managing the biology
and meditation being one of them.

330
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:36,290
Meditation and mindfulness and trying to
be centered and being the president has

331
00:19:36,451 --> 00:19:40,230
sort of emerged because so
many people are like, wow,

332
00:19:40,231 --> 00:19:42,780
am I fucking head's all over
the place? And this is, hey,

333
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:46,530
this is what I've learned. If you just
do this and say, this is where I am,

334
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,740
this is what I'm doing.
All of this stuff is nonsense.

335
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,830
I concentrate on this and this
I can get things done with.

336
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:57,770
But if I live in the past and worry about
all of the mistakes that I've made and

337
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:01,500
allow them to define them,
allow them to define me,

338
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:06,501
rather they can be very limiting and they
can really ruin your perceptions in a

339
00:20:06,871 --> 00:20:09,810
sense or flavor. Your
perceptions in a very, uh,

340
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:14,380
a unsatisfactory or a very
unwelcome way or your,

341
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:18,750
your day can be burdened by the past
or you could be in the PR like these.

342
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:23,751
All these things are sort of designed
to allow us to navigate the biological

343
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:29,520
waters, right? To, to figure out what
is the push and pull of this machine.

344
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,550
Like why is this machine jealous?
Like what's going on here?

345
00:20:32,551 --> 00:20:35,730
Why is this want me to be upset
at someone else's success?

346
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:40,260
Why does this want me to be upset that
someone is attracted to someone else

347
00:20:40,261 --> 00:20:40,951
other than me?

348
00:20:40,951 --> 00:20:44,280
Why does this want me to be upset at
someone else's house or someone else's,

349
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:48,130
you know, family or whatever it is
that is tweaking you. What, what's

350
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,360
going on in here?
Well,

351
00:20:49,361 --> 00:20:53,770
it's the machine wants competition
because the machine has gotten you to 2014

352
00:20:53,771 --> 00:20:58,480
where a million years ago a monkey crawled
out of a hole and a figured out a way

353
00:20:58,481 --> 00:21:01,960
to draw an Arrow that points towards
where the food is the other monkeys.

354
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,170
Oh that way you could be like,
aw, I see what you're doing.

355
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,440
And then those ideas compiled
and they piled on to other ideas.

356
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:12,730
And before, you know, what
a million years later,

357
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:16,000
we have a civilization and complex
civilization that has all these different

358
00:21:16,001 --> 00:21:18,460
influences that have led us to this point.

359
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:22,560
But a lot of them are biological.
A lot of the,

360
00:21:22,561 --> 00:21:27,400
the very motivations for doing most of
what people do on a daily basis are very

361
00:21:27,401 --> 00:21:29,830
biological.
When those are eliminated,

362
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,860
it becomes a real question
of like what's life,

363
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:35,170
what exactly are we?

364
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:40,470
And if we reproduce through test tubes
or whatever the hell it's going to be,

365
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:43,480
you know, when we become more, you know,

366
00:21:43,481 --> 00:21:47,740
three d printers or whatever it's going
to be when we become biological, um,

367
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:52,210
copies or artificial biology,
like what,

368
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,480
what are we and what is life?
Yeah.

369
00:21:55,570 --> 00:22:00,280
Those are really important
question gas. I guess. I think

370
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,850
one thing I thought was interesting
as I got into the transhumanist stuff,

371
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,690
you know, while back was that, you know,

372
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:09,220
they use this term mind uploading
to kind of predict, you know,

373
00:22:09,221 --> 00:22:12,490
we'd be able to upload our consciousness
into the cloud and stuff like that.

374
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:16,270
But I thought it was interesting that
later I realized they never then use the

375
00:22:16,271 --> 00:22:17,590
term body downloading.

376
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:22,150
So why is it that you can upload your
mind to the cloud but you can't then

377
00:22:22,151 --> 00:22:25,930
download your consciousness back
into different kinds of bodies.

378
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:29,230
And I think it speaks a little bit to
what Emily's saying, that there's a lot,

379
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:34,290
a lot of the shadow of the geek culture
is a disdain for the physical body and a

380
00:22:34,931 --> 00:22:38,950
disdained for limitations, which I
totally understand because you know,

381
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:43,240
I think there's part of us that wants
to transcend the limits of being human.

382
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:47,710
You know, and it's the same thing that
drives the Buddhist meditators to seek for

383
00:22:47,711 --> 00:22:52,270
enlightenment in its to realize this
thing which is beyond in some sense the

384
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,930
limitations of the human
experience. And yet, you know,

385
00:22:55,931 --> 00:23:00,931
the real mature expression or realization
in the Buddhist tradition is to

386
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:06,180
realize that and then to return back
into your incarnated physical form and to

387
00:23:07,871 --> 00:23:08,950
fully inhabit it.

388
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:14,040
So I hope that the transhumanists in the
folks that are building these, you know,

389
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:19,060
seeds of digital superintelligence realize
that even if we're able to upload our

390
00:23:19,061 --> 00:23:22,790
patterns into the cloud, we still, if, if,

391
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:26,530
if they're still beings who have
a sense of, of themselves and,

392
00:23:26,531 --> 00:23:30,100
and have some sort of physical substrate,
whether it's carbon or silicon,

393
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:33,850
that they're still going to have to
deal with certain issues of incarnation,

394
00:23:33,851 --> 00:23:37,600
of being in a form of
physical form of some sort.

395
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,310
Even if it's a very loose digital,
you know,

396
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:43,780
very fast flickering at form,
they could still,

397
00:23:43,781 --> 00:23:46,820
there's still something there and there's
still some sort of reference point.

398
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:50,060
And I think that's where the Buddhist
tradition has something to say,

399
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:54,470
even about super intelligence and
what that experience would be like.

400
00:23:54,471 --> 00:23:58,040
Because as long as there's a form and
as long as there's an identity, right,

401
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,690
like a reference point, uh, me,

402
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:03,830
then there's going to be certain kinds
of issues that we can't get rid of.

403
00:24:03,831 --> 00:24:07,250
Like then I have to deal with you and
have to deal with these other youth.

404
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:12,790
And I then there's things are objects
outside of me and some of them I want and

405
00:24:12,861 --> 00:24:14,990
some of them I don't want and some
of them are just going to ignore.

406
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:18,380
And so even if I were a
superintelligent consciousness,

407
00:24:18,381 --> 00:24:22,580
which I can't imagine because my
imagination so limited, um, I,

408
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:27,770
I still think there will be some amount
of fundamental dissatisfaction that's

409
00:24:27,771 --> 00:24:29,810
built into the experience of being

410
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:33,470
an individual who has a reference point.

411
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:39,130
And I think that's in some sense what
the Buddhist path is about seeing clearly

412
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:45,560
is that most of our existential
suffering and despair comes from this

413
00:24:45,561 --> 00:24:49,550
fundamental experience of being a separate
being who exists on this side of my

414
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:50,803
body.

415
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:52,490
But isn't the experience.

416
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,500
I mean if you really stop to think about
true enlightenment and being completely

417
00:24:56,501 --> 00:24:58,530
and completely in the moment,

418
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,140
it doesn't that exist in the
animal kingdom exclusively.

419
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:03,150
I mean that's the only way they exist.

420
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:08,180
They exist completely in the moment in
a sense that is the most biological of

421
00:25:08,281 --> 00:25:13,281
all creatures and that that's a
creature that has no existential issues.

422
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:13,890
They,

423
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:18,840
they don't have any angst in terms
of their future or their past.

424
00:25:18,841 --> 00:25:21,360
They, they, they live and
exist completely in the moment.

425
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:25,890
So isn't it just our awareness of
the futility of this existence?

426
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:30,891
That's part of the problem because
along the way we're innovating,

427
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:35,760
we're expanding, we're growing, we're,
we're doing all these different things.

428
00:25:35,761 --> 00:25:39,840
We're going to biohack and conferences
and whatever the hell you're doing.

429
00:25:39,841 --> 00:25:42,360
But at the end of the day,
you live and you die.

430
00:25:42,361 --> 00:25:44,280
You have a very short
window here and it's like,

431
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:48,180
what are you supposed to be doing,
I suppose to being joining it?

432
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:52,620
I supposed to be leaving it better for
the people that come after you and what's

433
00:25:52,621 --> 00:25:55,890
their poor purpose? Like why leave
it better for them? And what,

434
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,650
what are they doing? They're just
leaving it better for the next,

435
00:25:58,651 --> 00:25:59,910
at the end of the day,
what are we doing?

436
00:25:59,911 --> 00:26:04,260
We just enhancing this giant
super organism known as
the human race and for what

437
00:26:04,261 --> 00:26:09,180
purpose? Because we're helping it pollute
because we want more planes in the sky.

438
00:26:09,181 --> 00:26:12,960
We want better cell phones.
Like what? You know these, this,

439
00:26:12,961 --> 00:26:16,620
the existential angst of being,
of being conscious,

440
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:21,950
of being able to recognize that this
is kind of like at the end of the day,

441
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,200
like what? This is just a
weird little trip you're on.

442
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,600
You know you're on a
birth to death trip and

443
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:31,470
if you become something that's not human,

444
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:34,860
if you become something that's
not burdened by biology,

445
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,190
is not burdened by sexual urges or,

446
00:26:38,191 --> 00:26:40,690
or any of the petty urges of,

447
00:26:40,691 --> 00:26:44,040
of modern human and a life that we

448
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:48,690
all struggle with. What, what exactly are
you here for? What exactly is going on?

449
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:54,080
And motivation might be the number one
problem with artificial intelligence and

450
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,340
it might not even be compassion.

451
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:59,130
It might be that artificial intelligence

452
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:05,910
becomes so intelligent. So it's like,
what the F we're not doing shit. Okay,

453
00:27:05,911 --> 00:27:10,170
I'm not doing nothing. Why would I
do anything? Like why would I expand?

454
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:13,980
Why would I move on? Why would I make
more of me? Why would I do anything?

455
00:27:13,981 --> 00:27:18,000
Why would I explore galaxies? I
don't even have ovaries, you know,

456
00:27:18,001 --> 00:27:22,230
I don't have a mind.
I don't have a sense of of futility.

457
00:27:22,231 --> 00:27:24,570
I don't have a beginning and an end,
an end.

458
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,110
I can make another one of me with
a button like what am I doing?

459
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:31,710
Am I going to go see the top of,
you know, the Grand Canyon for what?

460
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,170
For what purpose?
What am I going to,

461
00:27:34,171 --> 00:27:38,280
I'm going to get fly in a plane and
go to Paris. Why? What do I go? Shit.

462
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:41,040
I don't have any desire to learn.

463
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:46,170
Like there's no urge to improve and
innovate. I'm not biological anymore.

464
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:53,070
Like what is created? Everything that
we have, everything that we have, every,

465
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,900
every building that we've ever made,

466
00:27:54,901 --> 00:27:59,901
every work of art that we've ever created
is essentially this thing inside human

467
00:28:00,301 --> 00:28:04,980
beings that wants us to
innovate and create this, this,

468
00:28:04,981 --> 00:28:09,981
this thing that has allowed us to
radically reshape our environment that has

469
00:28:10,771 --> 00:28:15,771
allowed us to design cities and
pieces and pieces of art and pieces of

470
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:20,460
architecture and all these
different things that we've
created has all come from

471
00:28:20,461 --> 00:28:23,850
that same desire, that desire
to continually improve. But if,

472
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,530
if the human body,

473
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:29,760
if we transcend it with some sort of an
artificial creation and we've become far

474
00:28:29,761 --> 00:28:34,590
more enlightened, intelligent, the,
the ultimate question will be why?

475
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:39,520
Well, I would say the ultimate
question for me would be who are we?

476
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:43,880
Yeah. What are we, what you're, yeah.
Or what, because you know, when,

477
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,990
when I'm listening to you talk
about this and I'm like, Huh,

478
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,900
there's a part of me that's like,
no, like, let's not do that.

479
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,180
And then there's this other
part of me that's like, yeah,

480
00:28:52,181 --> 00:28:54,490
that desire to create and
that desire to move forward.

481
00:28:54,491 --> 00:28:58,630
And the evolutionary impulse
in us all is so strong.

482
00:28:58,631 --> 00:29:00,490
And that's what makes us so beautiful.

483
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,020
And so when I have really touch into
the mystery of it all and the beauty and

484
00:29:05,021 --> 00:29:07,060
the wonder and what you're
talking about with the art,

485
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,050
to me it's like not such a question
of trying to get out of this anymore.

486
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:16,350
It's more like a question of how can we
use these technologies and the things

487
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:20,140
that we are learning through science
and the natural laws of things.

488
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:24,520
Because honestly, if we start to
violate much more of our natural laws,

489
00:29:24,521 --> 00:29:27,970
our oceans are going to rebel and like
our earth is going to become unstable.

490
00:29:27,971 --> 00:29:29,110
And we're seeing some of that.

491
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:34,530
So we do have to balance the biological
component with the evolutionary impulse.

492
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:40,480
And one thing that comes to my mind is
a philosopher Ken Wilber talks about

493
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:43,800
transcend include a lot.
So what if, you know,

494
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,770
part of what we're doing is learning how
to transcend some of our limitations as

495
00:29:47,771 --> 00:29:51,840
human beings. And at the same time
include some of those limitations, um,

496
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:55,900
that keeps us grounded. Um, I think
that's really important as well.

497
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,550
Transcend and include.

498
00:29:58,490 --> 00:29:58,641
Yeah.

499
00:29:58,641 --> 00:30:03,641
I just wonder what would happen if we
eliminated all of our biological urges and

500
00:30:04,851 --> 00:30:06,590
would things just completely stop?

501
00:30:06,591 --> 00:30:10,670
Why would anybody create art if we
don't want to impress other folks? Well,

502
00:30:10,671 --> 00:30:12,530
if I think of, we have
a choice, maybe some,

503
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:17,090
some individuals would choose to do to
eliminate those things and maybe some

504
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,190
would choose not to. Right? Yeah. Well,

505
00:30:19,191 --> 00:30:22,700
if there's like a huge diversity and
it's not just one thing that we become,

506
00:30:22,701 --> 00:30:26,600
what if it's like many things and people
just kind of decided to go off and

507
00:30:26,601 --> 00:30:30,040
reprogram their consciousness
and various ways why?

508
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:35,041
I've always been fascinated by this idea
of constant improvement and it's sort

509
00:30:37,251 --> 00:30:41,090
of what fuels modern corporations.

510
00:30:41,091 --> 00:30:45,350
This idea of constant growth
is it fuels human beings.

511
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:50,270
Like no one is happy with where they are.
They want a bigger house,

512
00:30:50,271 --> 00:30:54,800
they want a better car. They want,
you know, if they're an artist,

513
00:30:54,801 --> 00:30:57,320
they want to create their latest,
greatest masterpiece.

514
00:30:57,321 --> 00:30:59,840
They don't want to sit on their laurels.
They want to consistently,

515
00:30:59,841 --> 00:31:02,990
constantly improve. Where's the iPhone
six I'm still waiting. I'm waiting.

516
00:31:02,991 --> 00:31:05,900
I'm like, yeah, we have this consistent,

517
00:31:05,901 --> 00:31:08,120
constant need for improvement.

518
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:13,180
And that is essentially designed in
into the evolutionary process itself.

519
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:16,850
Like that's what led single
celled organisms to divide,

520
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,580
become multi-celled organisms to
get out of the ocean, to seek land,

521
00:31:20,581 --> 00:31:24,600
to seek shelter, to seek
improvements in, you know,

522
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:28,010
altering its environment in order to
protect itself from predators. It's,

523
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,040
which led us to the 21st
century to where we are today.

524
00:31:31,041 --> 00:31:34,700
Having this conversation that somehow,
I don't know if you understand it,

525
00:31:34,701 --> 00:31:39,110
but I don't understand how my voice is
being processed down into ones and zeros

526
00:31:39,111 --> 00:31:42,140
and pump through the sky and people are
getting it on their phone right now is

527
00:31:42,141 --> 00:31:46,790
they're driving in their car. This is
madness. This is a mad, mad, mad world.

528
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:50,930
And what is the, what's the
urge behind all of it? Well,

529
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:55,190
it's this biological need for innovation,

530
00:31:55,191 --> 00:31:58,880
this biological need for
constant improvement and it's,

531
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:02,030
it's designed in the evolutionary
process itself. I mean,

532
00:32:02,031 --> 00:32:06,140
it's a part of the evolutionary process.
I mean, why? Why do animals evolve?

533
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:10,520
Why don't they just say fuck it? If these
fish keep grabbing us, let's just, uh,

534
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:13,160
let's just stay the same
color and go extinct.

535
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:16,450
No bugs you like start looking like,

536
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:20,900
have you seen caterpillars that like
look like predators they have did develop

537
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:25,930
eyes on their backs so that they can
look scary so that less animals eat them?

538
00:32:26,061 --> 00:32:30,410
Or at least they have gotten to that
point where that design, I mean,

539
00:32:30,411 --> 00:32:32,390
I don't know how you can ever really,
truly,

540
00:32:32,391 --> 00:32:37,280
completely explain some
of these butterflies that
have these elaborate images

541
00:32:37,281 --> 00:32:40,610
that have sort of throughout,
I mean,

542
00:32:40,611 --> 00:32:44,740
how many hundreds of thousands or
millions of years of evolution, but it's,

543
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:49,810
it's incredibly fascinating that they've
developed this need to figure out how

544
00:32:50,781 --> 00:32:54,330
to trick animals so that they can
continue to breed. They've improved,

545
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,990
they've innovative and that's that.

546
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:59,630
If you could really talk to a
butterfly and go listen to it,

547
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:02,990
you only live a week. Why
fucker? What do you care?

548
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:06,770
Like if you die or your relatives die,
what kind of a bullshit life is this?

549
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:10,220
You know, you live a week, you fly around,
people go, Ooh, look at the butterfly.

550
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:13,070
And then it's over. Like, let a
bunch of lizards eat you. Let's,

551
00:33:13,071 --> 00:33:14,960
let's just get this over
with. Let's, you know,

552
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:20,260
come back as a better bug figure out how
to exist as a microbe inside the body

553
00:33:20,301 --> 00:33:24,800
of the animals that are eating you and
then develop from its poop into some

554
00:33:24,801 --> 00:33:27,740
magical plant that enlightens the
people that eat it or something.

555
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:31,970
But living as a butterfly is bullshit,
but they don't think that way.

556
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,530
There's just this, it's part of this
process is continue to innovate,

557
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:39,230
constantly push forward,
make things better.

558
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:43,730
If we stop being biological,
does everything just stopped?

559
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:48,290
Does everything just eh, and did you
know what, what is the conversation then?

560
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:51,880
What if you don't have a
motivation? If the, you,

561
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:55,400
you don't have an expiration date,
if you don't have

562
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:58,220
people's,
uh,

563
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:03,280
sexual choices to appeal to if you don't
have people's social choices to appeal

564
00:34:03,981 --> 00:34:06,680
to.
If you don't want people to like you,

565
00:34:06,681 --> 00:34:10,100
if you don't have any desire biologically,
what's the motivation?

566
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:11,840
Okay.

567
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:16,060
Well, I mean, obviously this is highly
speculative in a way. Yes. But, um,

568
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,013
hm.

569
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:21,930
Maybe I'd just throw in one piece. Sure.
Okay. Kind of bring it back down to the,

570
00:34:21,931 --> 00:34:25,980
um, to the analog version of,
of intelligence, which is, uh,

571
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:30,270
these human bodies sitting here
having this conversation. Um,

572
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,860
if that's okay with you. Um, I,

573
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:37,320
I'd say there's another piece that's
really important in what you're saying.

574
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,080
There is the drive to
innovate and to transcend,

575
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:44,220
but then I think there's also a very
powerful force that moves in the other

576
00:34:44,221 --> 00:34:49,221
direction and I would call it
compassion or care or love.

577
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:54,690
And it's that part of us that
wants to include everything.

578
00:34:54,691 --> 00:34:57,630
Like Emily mentioned, transcending
and including, you know,

579
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:59,430
we can become better
and better and better,

580
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:03,330
but what good is it if everyone
else has left behind, you know,

581
00:35:03,331 --> 00:35:05,310
what good is it if
we're, you know, living,

582
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:10,170
living the high life and
there are millions of people
who are struggling to feed

583
00:35:10,171 --> 00:35:11,940
themselves, um, you know,

584
00:35:11,941 --> 00:35:15,660
at some level when we get in touch with
the reality of that there's part of us,

585
00:35:15,661 --> 00:35:17,820
if our hearts are open,
you know,

586
00:35:17,821 --> 00:35:22,821
that really resonates with the pain of
that and wants to include and wants to

587
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,820
respond to that suffering
into that difficulty.

588
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:30,240
And I think that's part of the
reason life exists as well.

589
00:35:30,241 --> 00:35:32,790
It's one of the primary reasons
is not just to transcend,

590
00:35:32,791 --> 00:35:36,930
but it's also to care for and
to respond to the needs of,

591
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,720
because we realized
it's not just about us.

592
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:44,160
Like it's not just this experience
that's important. There are the,

593
00:35:44,161 --> 00:35:45,240
all these others,
you know,

594
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:48,940
that are also having an experience and
they're not unlike me. You know, there,

595
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:53,990
and that's why compassion can can exist
because I realize like your experience

596
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:58,480
is not unlike my experience. There's a
way in which we have this common, um,

597
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:02,580
hardware wetware this common
sense of consciousness.

598
00:36:02,581 --> 00:36:06,900
I assume this, you know,
calm, common hopes and fears,

599
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:10,800
desires. Um, and so in
that sense, you know,

600
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:15,660
I think compassion is a really powerful
force that also holds life together and

601
00:36:15,661 --> 00:36:18,870
keeps it from fleeing apart into the,
into the ethers.

602
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:22,730
But the cynical objective amongst
us would look at that and say, well,

603
00:36:22,731 --> 00:36:23,840
that's just a mechanism.

604
00:36:23,841 --> 00:36:28,280
In order to keep society together to
allow this consistent innovation, you,

605
00:36:28,281 --> 00:36:31,970
you need people to stay together in
order to get people to work together in

606
00:36:31,971 --> 00:36:36,290
order to get the maximum amount of
productivity out of the human mind and

607
00:36:36,291 --> 00:36:40,190
creativity. I mean, there's no, there's
only one way they have to love each other.

608
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:43,030
If they don't love each other, they're
not going to build shit. They're not,

609
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:46,970
they're going to go live like Ted
Kaczynski and hide up in the woods and a

610
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:49,940
little shack and try to stay away
from each other as much as possible.

611
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:54,020
Part of the reason why we do so
well is because we have compassion.

612
00:36:54,021 --> 00:36:59,021
So it could certainly be considered an
evolutionary device to ensure innovation

613
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,170
and constant growth. And it has, I mean,

614
00:37:03,171 --> 00:37:07,820
every society that has done well has been
a society that cherished its members.

615
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:10,700
If you don't give a
fuck about your members,

616
00:37:10,701 --> 00:37:14,670
you get a North Korea type situation where
there's no innovation. The, the, the,

617
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:18,560
the country stagnant. Everyone lives
in fear. The lights are off at night.

618
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:22,940
And that's a worst case
scenario for a modern culture.

619
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:26,210
And that model that is based
almost entirely on the,

620
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,100
those same ideas that like the,

621
00:37:28,101 --> 00:37:31,700
the lack of compassion for
your fellow beings exhibited.

622
00:37:31,701 --> 00:37:34,680
Like if you looked at the
one thing or you ask me,

623
00:37:34,681 --> 00:37:38,540
what's the one thing that troubles you
most about a brutal dictatorship like

624
00:37:38,541 --> 00:37:41,030
North Korea,
while the poor people that live there,

625
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:42,920
the poor people that are suffering,
that lived there,

626
00:37:42,921 --> 00:37:46,700
our compassion as a part of what makes
us, it's a, it's a, it's a component,

627
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,460
a critical component,
which makes us successful.

628
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:55,200
Yeah. And I think, you know, you can
look at it from that perspective,

629
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,810
but I think there's other
ways to look at it. Um,

630
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,770
which has that compassion in and
of itself as a good, you know,

631
00:38:01,771 --> 00:38:05,550
that there's something inherent in the
experience of compassion of the open

632
00:38:05,551 --> 00:38:09,240
heart that's responding to suffering,
which is in itself good.

633
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,460
And that hum,
you know,

634
00:38:11,461 --> 00:38:15,040
when you experience and touch into
that space which completely dissolves

635
00:38:15,041 --> 00:38:19,440
cynicism, um, in, in the
moment of it. Um, there is, uh,

636
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:22,230
there is this feeling of
this is this is right.

637
00:38:22,231 --> 00:38:26,400
Like this is right to respond to the
difficulty of other beings because on some

638
00:38:26,401 --> 00:38:31,110
fundamental level we aren't separate from
each other and in some fundamental way,

639
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:34,500
the level of the, of the
universe itself, you know,

640
00:38:34,501 --> 00:38:37,900
everything arose out of this
momentary big bang, right?

641
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:41,110
That's our current story about it.
Like, okay, what the fuck was that?

642
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:45,010
Where did that w w what was that?
That it all came from this nothing,

643
00:38:45,011 --> 00:38:49,630
this infinitely small point
in space actually, you know,

644
00:38:49,631 --> 00:38:51,850
the Big Bang isn't something
that happened in the past.

645
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:55,050
It's something that is happening
right now. It's something that the,

646
00:38:55,630 --> 00:39:00,630
that which was prior to the universe is
still here and that is also our nature

647
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:05,500
and that nature is naturally
compassionate. It naturally responds.

648
00:39:05,501 --> 00:39:07,090
It naturally includes everything.

649
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,690
So I think there's something in us
that also wants to reunite with our own

650
00:39:10,691 --> 00:39:13,560
deepest heart and our own deepest mind,
but does it right

651
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:16,650
really? Because if that's
the case, and how do you,

652
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:19,620
how do you factor in predators?

653
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,180
How do you factor in the,
the,

654
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:26,040
the constant competition in the
wild that exists everywhere.

655
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:31,020
Compassion really only exists when there's
safety. So the only time that exists,

656
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:35,900
when would you know, when you worry
about your own existence constantly,

657
00:39:35,901 --> 00:39:39,330
it's like this rabid
sort of primal struggle.

658
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:43,260
What all that is put to rest and you
build up walls and you have a fire and you

659
00:39:43,261 --> 00:39:46,020
can hold each other and
everyone's together and fine.

660
00:39:46,021 --> 00:39:48,630
Then there's the the room
and need for compassion.

661
00:39:48,631 --> 00:39:51,570
But with the Eagle and the fish,
there's no compassion.

662
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:57,530
I think you're speaking to our habitual
patterns that get ingrained in us as we

663
00:39:57,561 --> 00:40:01,040
grow up. And with the Buddhist
training that I've been through,

664
00:40:01,041 --> 00:40:04,340
it really does teach us how to start
to deconstruct some of that training.

665
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:05,151
I mean,

666
00:40:05,151 --> 00:40:10,151
compassion naturally arises in a moment's
notice without there being this strong

667
00:40:10,461 --> 00:40:15,140
sense of like contraction around
our small sense of self. You know,

668
00:40:15,141 --> 00:40:16,790
when your child reaches for the stove,

669
00:40:16,791 --> 00:40:19,820
you're going to try to jerk it back
because you don't want it to burn itself.

670
00:40:19,821 --> 00:40:23,240
Right? That's a level of
compassion does naturally arising

671
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,140
well. That's, that's also being,
uh, you're in a mentor role.

672
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:31,800
You're teaching this human being about
things and it doesn't understand yet.

673
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,430
Yeah.

674
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:36,060
I would think of more of compassion as
someone you have no biological connection

675
00:40:36,061 --> 00:40:39,510
to at all and you see them
in need of help and you help.

676
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:43,790
And there's something that's
inherently satisfying about that. Um,

677
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:46,140
when you do help someone,
it's very strange.

678
00:40:46,141 --> 00:40:48,330
Like me and my friend Todd were driving,

679
00:40:48,331 --> 00:40:52,920
we were in North Carolina and we were
driving down the road and we saw this car.

680
00:40:52,921 --> 00:40:57,090
It had like, um, it's ha hazards on,
but they were like really, really damn.

681
00:40:57,091 --> 00:41:00,240
And I was on the side of the
road. And, uh, as we pass the car,

682
00:41:00,241 --> 00:41:02,040
maybe a couple hundred yards later,

683
00:41:02,041 --> 00:41:06,630
we saw a guy lying on his back and we
were like, oh shit, something happened.

684
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:09,720
So we stopped the car, we got out, we
helped. The guy would called nine one one.

685
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:13,910
We got the guy up, he had severe
asthma, his car ran out of gas and he,

686
00:41:13,911 --> 00:41:16,470
he had an asthmatic attack and fell and,

687
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,780
and we spent a bunch of time
with this guy and the cops. And,

688
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:23,460
and after it was over, we have this like
feeling the guy was safe. The guy was,

689
00:41:23,461 --> 00:41:25,200
you know, the guide him in
the hospital, in an ambulance.

690
00:41:25,201 --> 00:41:28,920
They took him to the hospital. They
did, the whole thing was resolved.

691
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,380
And we had this like elation,

692
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:35,690
this like light feeling happiness
that we did something. Yeah,

693
00:41:35,691 --> 00:41:38,930
we were tired and we just flown in and
we would rather just go to our hotel,

694
00:41:38,931 --> 00:41:43,670
but instead we spend an hour
or so and we felt way better.

695
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:44,180
You know,

696
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:49,180
it's like this feeling of elevation
you've helped your fellow being right.

697
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:51,410
So it's naturally programmed.
Dennis.

698
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,360
And so therefore we can
continue to cultivate that.

699
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,850
And so it's more of a consistent state

700
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,440
that's present. That's
what I've learned. Yeah.

701
00:42:00,441 --> 00:42:05,000
That's where the cynic would say that the
whole reason for that is so that these

702
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:08,120
humans can breed and make
more humans to figure,

703
00:42:08,121 --> 00:42:11,860
figured out a made way to make a better
electric car who figured out a way to

704
00:42:11,861 --> 00:42:12,860
make like a wormhole.

705
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,360
It also reminds me of science
in the mirror neurons to,

706
00:42:15,361 --> 00:42:16,680
cause we're learning that,
you know,

707
00:42:16,681 --> 00:42:19,740
we're mirroring each other and what
you're doing is effecting me and what I'm

708
00:42:19,741 --> 00:42:24,270
doing is affecting you and it's rewiring
our brains as we're talking. So, yeah.

709
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:24,871
So I mean,

710
00:42:24,871 --> 00:42:28,170
in that sense like we really are so
connected that we don't even realize how

711
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:31,950
connected we are. So in a sense, yeah,

712
00:42:31,951 --> 00:42:33,750
it is one of the most important things

713
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:37,410
you did connect. Connection
is undeniable. And it's, uh,

714
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:41,220
it's fascinating when you see people
change the people that they hang around

715
00:42:41,221 --> 00:42:45,240
with. Yeah. And they all of
a sudden improve or regress.

716
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:48,870
And that's a, that's a consistent
pattern with human beings.

717
00:42:48,871 --> 00:42:52,320
You find a really good group of friends
are super healthy and like to do a lot

718
00:42:52,321 --> 00:42:52,801
of exciting,

719
00:42:52,801 --> 00:42:56,100
fun things and they're compassionate to
each other and you start mimicking that

720
00:42:56,101 --> 00:42:58,290
behavior or at least mirroring
that behavior, right?

721
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,910
Or when you're around people
that are just complete massive.

722
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:03,950
So we don't have to be ruled
by her biological desires.

723
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:07,190
So when you're saying like greed and
hatred and competition and all that,

724
00:43:07,191 --> 00:43:12,191
then I mean maybe that is where we are
at a certain point in some of us are and

725
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:17,240
with evolutionary drive to continue to
create an open and really deepen into

726
00:43:17,241 --> 00:43:21,640
what some of the wisdom traditions
have been talking about, then you know,

727
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:25,970
it's possible to like, I dunno,
evolve ourselves as we're,

728
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:27,350
as we're even talking here.

729
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:28,030
Yeah.
But Mike,

730
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:33,030
my question remains like when you
remove all of these biological urges,

731
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:36,070
what is the purpose of this thing?
Because it doesn't,

732
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:41,120
this doesn't seem to me that there would
be any reason to go on if you removed

733
00:43:41,351 --> 00:43:42,400
everything biologic.

734
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:46,070
That's just, yeah, that's just something,
I mean, you can think like that,

735
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,080
but what would be the purpose we do?
I think it's hard to know.

736
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,400
I mean this is my point of view is like,

737
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:53,940
it's hard to know because we don't know
what it would be like, right. To be that,

738
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:57,660
to be whatever that is. Yeah. Mine's
go and try to construct it all.

739
00:43:57,690 --> 00:43:58,890
So it's sort of like,

740
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:02,880
if we can only imagine what it
would be like not to be like we are,

741
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:06,630
but it's hard to imagine what it would
be like to be something that has yet not

742
00:44:06,631 --> 00:44:07,470
yet emerged.

743
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:12,000
So maybe maybe we could have a followup
interview and we've all attained

744
00:44:12,001 --> 00:44:16,260
superintelligence and we can be
no need for podcasts. Well we can,

745
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:20,170
we can get together in the, uh, the
instantaneous MindMeld which is, you know,

746
00:44:20,171 --> 00:44:23,580
intelligence and riff on that.
That

747
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:27,900
to me seems more likely than any
of those other scenarios. I, I,

748
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:30,750
I wonder like what the next step is.

749
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:36,020
I've stopped many times and I've spent
like entire days thinking about a

750
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:40,740
thousand years from today to a
thousand years from now. Like, what is,

751
00:44:40,741 --> 00:44:42,300
what is the difference and what,

752
00:44:42,301 --> 00:44:45,360
what is the difference going to be
and how radical is it going to be?

753
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:46,720
How radical was the shift?

754
00:44:46,721 --> 00:44:51,570
And I really have a feeling that it's
going to have nothing to do with the body

755
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:53,520
and all to do with the mind.

756
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,560
And I think that this idea of
transcending the, the human body,

757
00:44:58,561 --> 00:45:03,510
and I have a feeling they're going to
figure out some way that the human mind

758
00:45:03,511 --> 00:45:06,240
can access other states,
dimensions,

759
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:10,170
levels of consciousness that literally
the human body will be irrelevant.

760
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:12,700
Well, it already can. Oh yeah. We,

761
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:16,110
we already can access all kinds of crazy
stuff for some of the trainings that

762
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:20,700
I've learned in meditation or
psychedelics opened that up. Yeah,

763
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,990
yeah, exactly right. But what's going
on there? What is that? Do we know?

764
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:26,310
What is that?
Is that,

765
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:29,880
are you opening up the flood gates for
human neuro transmitters and the body's

766
00:45:29,881 --> 00:45:34,200
ability to process them get skewed and
you, it presents you with all sorts of,

767
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:39,230
you know, delusional beliefs
and crazy visions because your,

768
00:45:39,231 --> 00:45:42,930
your visual cortex can't process
all these chemicals correctly.

769
00:45:42,931 --> 00:45:45,120
So you have this wild,
fantastic ride,

770
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:50,040
gives you the sense of euphoria and
this elated sense of being disillusioned

771
00:45:50,041 --> 00:45:54,200
with it. Huh? No, not at all. No. Just
completely offering the devil's advocate.

772
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:55,920
Yeah, yeah. No, I, I appreciate that.

773
00:45:55,921 --> 00:46:00,921
I mean I think that point of view is
coming at it from the biological physical

774
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:05,700
perspective, but then there's all said
that perspective of consciousness itself,

775
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:08,700
you know,
of the experiential aspect of it,

776
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:14,090
which is I think also a
part of the challenge of our
moment in time I think is,

777
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:18,990
is starting to recognize that both of
these perspectives are valid, that the,

778
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:22,410
the perspective of consciousness
of experience is also valid.

779
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:26,380
So from the perspective of
consciousness, you know, it,

780
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:32,430
those altered states of experience reveal
something valid. Now whether or not,

781
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:35,880
you know, we can from that point of
view, describe the biology of it.

782
00:46:35,881 --> 00:46:37,110
I think it's clear we can't,

783
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,260
and so it's useful to have a description
of like this is what's happening in the

784
00:46:40,261 --> 00:46:42,190
brain,
these areas or d,

785
00:46:42,191 --> 00:46:45,240
Afrin shading and then these areas
are lighting up and all of that stuff.

786
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:47,730
But that's not who we,
that's not all of who we are.

787
00:46:47,731 --> 00:46:50,940
We're not just brains because you know,

788
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:55,650
we're having thoughts about brains and
the only way brains exists is through

789
00:46:55,651 --> 00:46:58,990
our, through our internal
representations of brains and in,

790
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:01,860
in terms of human consciousness.
So I think, you know,

791
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:05,910
that'd be the other perspective is like
consciousness itself is also a valid

792
00:47:05,911 --> 00:47:09,270
perspective on this. And from
that point of view, you know,

793
00:47:09,271 --> 00:47:12,120
those moments of altered
experience of like compassion,

794
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:16,750
like you described when you realized
you helped the person in Asheville, um,

795
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:18,220
and were there for him or you know,

796
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:23,270
when your child's born or when you take
a hallucinogenic a medicine with the

797
00:47:23,851 --> 00:47:26,580
intention of learning more
about your old, you know, your,

798
00:47:26,581 --> 00:47:31,090
your deepest nature or something about
yourself or going on a meditation retreat

799
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,580
and exploring your
experience moment by moment.

800
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:38,560
I think those things reveal very
important truths that are at the level of

801
00:47:38,561 --> 00:47:41,620
consciousness itself that,
you know,

802
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:46,570
you can't convince a skeptic
or cynic that they're true,

803
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,840
but you can give them the
instructions and say, hey,

804
00:47:49,841 --> 00:47:53,040
run this program and see
what happens. Um, and, and,

805
00:47:53,041 --> 00:47:56,570
and if you do it with a certain kind
of intention, then you know, it,

806
00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:59,050
it changes your life.
It changes your perspective,

807
00:47:59,051 --> 00:48:02,440
it changes your sense of who you are,
you know, and what this is all about.

808
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:07,150
And I appreciate that you're pointing
out, you know, the, the one side of it,

809
00:48:07,151 --> 00:48:11,320
which is that, you know, yeah,
this is a, this is a limited trip.

810
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:13,930
Like we don't, we don't really know
what the hell is happening here.

811
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,490
We don't know how he got into this body.

812
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,800
At least I don't remember
how I got into this body.

813
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:23,620
I don't know why it's happening. Right.
Um, and then like, we're gonna die,

814
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:26,830
you know, at some point, and we don't
know when. That's the other thing.

815
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:30,970
We know we're going to die, but we
don't know when. We don't know how, um,

816
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:34,020
we don't know how long for now.
And so there is a certain,

817
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:36,430
certain kind of like in your face

818
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:42,280
shock about that, that I think we're
constantly coping with as human beings.

819
00:48:42,281 --> 00:48:45,460
You know, we're crying constantly and
compassion can be a way to cope with that.

820
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:49,630
You know and love,
like there's a term that the,

821
00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:53,530
this Tibetan master used who came to
the America and the 70s named chuck him

822
00:48:53,531 --> 00:48:53,871
trunk,
but,

823
00:48:53,871 --> 00:48:57,730
and he said there's compassion and
then there's idiot compassion and idiot

824
00:48:57,731 --> 00:49:01,180
compassion is when you are trying to
respond to suffering because you can't

825
00:49:01,181 --> 00:49:04,120
handle it because you don't,
you can't actually deal with it.

826
00:49:04,121 --> 00:49:08,410
So you try to like make it go away or you
try to Oh poor you, poor you, you know,

827
00:49:08,411 --> 00:49:09,400
that kind of compassion.

828
00:49:09,401 --> 00:49:14,401
So compassion can just as easily be a way
to cope with the shocking reality that

829
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:18,610
we don't know what's even
going to happen next,

830
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:23,020
let alone like what's going to
happen in 5,200 years from now.

831
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:25,750
Um,
does that make sense?

832
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,370
Sort of.

833
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:32,490
I always felt like compassion was just
the way that we kept together the,

834
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:37,210
we kept our love for each other and bonds
and that feeling other people's pain

835
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:40,570
is a way to ensure that we
minimize that as much as possible.

836
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:43,630
And that it's just sort of a
part of the biological process,

837
00:49:43,631 --> 00:49:47,800
especially the biological process of
transcending the simple monkey mind.

838
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:51,910
And moving into some new state,
the the ability to understand each other,

839
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:55,100
communicate, express
information and, and, and,

840
00:49:55,110 --> 00:50:00,110
and also to be able to conceptualize
very bizarre ideas that human beings have

841
00:50:01,271 --> 00:50:03,310
kind of based their entire society on.

842
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:07,840
We based our society on
bizarre things like laws,

843
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:12,850
regulations, money, the bandwidth,

844
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:13,211
you know,

845
00:50:13,211 --> 00:50:18,211
there's a weird concepts that we have had
to factor in to our view of the world,

846
00:50:20,170 --> 00:50:22,100
the environment, our, our,

847
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:25,450
our interaction with that environment
or effect on that environment.

848
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,320
How much can we mitigate that?

849
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,630
How much is just a necessary
evil to maintain our,

850
00:50:30,631 --> 00:50:35,060
our wonderful existence with
air conditioning and you
know, high speed Internet.

851
00:50:35,061 --> 00:50:37,320
I mean, what, what are
those thoughts were,

852
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:41,390
where are those things going and how
much of those are connected to, again,

853
00:50:41,391 --> 00:50:45,080
the same thing.
This constant need to stay together,

854
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:48,350
help each other innovate,
how each other move forward,

855
00:50:48,351 --> 00:50:50,030
press forward and continue to grow.

856
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:55,640
And is something like Buddhism or
transcendental meditation or anything,

857
00:50:55,880 --> 00:51:00,880
are these just sort of like ways
to get through this and in a,

858
00:51:01,741 --> 00:51:06,500
in a relatively sane way, are these
essentially man created technologies,

859
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:09,440
human created technologies to
mitigate the natural world?

860
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:15,280
I mean, in a way they clearly
are. I mean, cause humans, yeah.

861
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:16,960
I'm sat under trees,
you know,

862
00:51:16,961 --> 00:51:21,961
in India 2,500 years ago of thousands of
years ago and explored their own minds

863
00:51:22,691 --> 00:51:26,380
and did come up with various,
you know, programs for how to,

864
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:27,760
how to work with experience.

865
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:32,470
Isn't that fascinating that someone a
long time ago was like looking around

866
00:51:32,471 --> 00:51:34,960
people hacking each other to death
with swords and he was like, you know,

867
00:51:35,290 --> 00:51:39,240
there's gotta be a way around some
of this shit, you know, like what is,

868
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,590
what's going on here?
Why is everybody,

869
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:44,440
why is every launch in arrows
over the top of those walls?

870
00:51:44,441 --> 00:51:47,890
Like what the fuck are we
doing and why in India,

871
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:50,560
what the hell is going
on in India? Yeah. Know,

872
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:55,630
India's been the birthplace of alive
developments in consciousness and not

873
00:51:55,931 --> 00:51:56,764
coincidentally

874
00:51:56,820 --> 00:52:01,820
worships cows who not coincidentally make
cow shit from double Angela at animals

875
00:52:02,251 --> 00:52:06,540
that siliciden mushrooms grow on
and completely connected for sure.

876
00:52:06,541 --> 00:52:09,680
Without a doubt. And Soma, you know, the,

877
00:52:09,681 --> 00:52:14,681
the ancient vedic traditions and all
these ancient Hindu texts that speak of

878
00:52:15,091 --> 00:52:18,210
these psychedelic drugs, we don't
even know what the hell they were.

879
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:23,220
These important psychedelic aspects of
their culture that are completely lost.

880
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:25,740
Like no one knows what Soma is.

881
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:30,790
It means it's a huge part of their
ancient religious tradition and you know,

882
00:52:31,381 --> 00:52:34,020
whatever it is is like
completely up for debate.

883
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:37,760
Some feel it's a common story drug with,
you know,

884
00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:41,730
the Amanita miscarry and silicide bin
and all sorts of different things,

885
00:52:41,731 --> 00:52:43,680
but no one knows just all guesswork,

886
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:50,130
but that's gotta be a part of it. Right.
Someone ate some mushrooms and said,

887
00:52:50,131 --> 00:52:54,870
those cows are awesome. We need to keep
those guys around. Don't eat the cows.

888
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:58,590
Eat this. Oh yeah, I don't need the
cows like this came from the cows. Yes.

889
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,570
You know,
like what a trip.

890
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,450
I'm just starving people letting cows
go because the cows make shit that

891
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:06,410
from scrolling.
Yeah man.

892
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:11,290
I think it's crazy too that people
figured out how to pay attention and use

893
00:53:11,291 --> 00:53:15,130
their body in a way to produce some of
those effects and dodgy honestly know to

894
00:53:15,131 --> 00:53:18,520
be able to experience that even
without mushrooms, you know,

895
00:53:18,521 --> 00:53:21,550
to be able to get into this kind of
states of consciousness and even to

896
00:53:21,551 --> 00:53:26,130
stabilize them, you know, as
a, as a kind of of existence.

897
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:26,800
Well

898
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,830
Delaney masters people that are
really good at, and Delaney,

899
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:33,400
I have a friend who teaches it and he
says that he can reach these complete

900
00:53:33,401 --> 00:53:37,840
psychedelic states where he's interacting
with beings that may or may not be

901
00:53:37,841 --> 00:53:40,870
there that he can visually
recognize in front of him.

902
00:53:40,871 --> 00:53:45,260
Like he can see it as if he's tripping.
And I'm like, well, how do you,

903
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:46,620
how are you getting there?

904
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:50,330
It's just years and years and years
of mindfulness in this very specific

905
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:52,900
right concentration,
you know,

906
00:53:52,901 --> 00:53:56,890
is the always tied to and
every contemplative tradition,

907
00:53:56,980 --> 00:54:00,040
these sort of psychedelic
or psychic experiences,

908
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:01,920
it's like the ability to focus and to,

909
00:54:02,090 --> 00:54:06,110
to be able to absorb consciousness in
one thing seems to be the gateway and to

910
00:54:06,111 --> 00:54:10,480
which, you know, all of those other
weird, yeah, experiences can arise,

911
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,210
but you're told to not pay attention.

912
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:15,730
Those experiences that that's like you're
missing the point if you're trying to

913
00:54:15,731 --> 00:54:18,790
seek out these hallucinations,
Simpson traditions.

914
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:22,690
A lot of Buddhist traditions
do sort of suggest dunk,

915
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:24,340
not getting sidetracked by them,

916
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:29,440
but they inform us and change the way
that we can relate to things that they are

917
00:54:29,441 --> 00:54:31,990
important and goal,

918
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:37,420
that they can definitely do a
lot of good work, you know, and,

919
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:42,610
and a lot of weird shit. Oh yeah. I mean
sorcery like in Tibet, you know? Yeah.

920
00:54:42,611 --> 00:54:46,270
There's like all these people like out
there like casting weird stuff at each

921
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:48,310
other. And you know, I don't,
I haven't been to Tibet,

922
00:54:48,311 --> 00:54:51,460
so I don't know how much of it is like
you can just see weird stuff happening

923
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:54,340
and how much of it is their mythology,
but all the same,

924
00:54:54,341 --> 00:54:58,600
like there's enough weird stories coming
out of places of people that have been

925
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:03,640
sitting in caves for millennia
exploring their own consciousness.

926
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:07,270
So we're already uploading. I mean,
we've been, I guess, uploading,

927
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:09,100
at least on some level.
Well,

928
00:55:09,101 --> 00:55:12,160
the artwork itself as
representative of these experiences,

929
00:55:12,161 --> 00:55:16,240
if you look at to baton artwork, it's so
trippy. It's mindblowing. So psychedelic.

930
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:20,890
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. We did it. A
meditation a couple of weekends ago,

931
00:55:20,891 --> 00:55:25,180
and one of the guided meditations was
to imagine a lotus flower in your heart

932
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:30,430
that had a thousand petals and each
petal with shooting off a beam of clear

933
00:55:30,431 --> 00:55:34,000
light that connected with another
pedal and another being's heart.

934
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:38,680
And that sort of spread it out infinitely.
But it also went in both directions,

935
00:55:38,681 --> 00:55:42,910
like in terms of the atomic and quantum
level and the universes within Adams.

936
00:55:42,911 --> 00:55:46,380
And it went outward in all
directions. And I'm like, wow,

937
00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:48,700
okay these these dudes were,
you know,

938
00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:51,700
cause they mostly were dudes
that were able to do this.

939
00:55:51,701 --> 00:55:56,680
These dudes were like exploring the
furthest reaches of, of the inner,

940
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:58,300
you know,
Cosmos.

941
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:01,870
What do you mean by there were mostly
dudes that were able to do this? Well,

942
00:56:01,871 --> 00:56:04,720
I mean the cultures of Tibet
and most of these places,

943
00:56:04,721 --> 00:56:07,540
you know there were nuns and there
were women doing the practices,

944
00:56:07,541 --> 00:56:11,080
but I don't think they had as much
opportunity to do them because of the,

945
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:13,600
you know,
the Organization of their cultures.

946
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:17,560
But there's not a biological limitations
and achieving these experiences. No.

947
00:56:17,561 --> 00:56:21,490
Actually the Tibetans say
women have an easier time at,

948
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:24,130
at these practices for seven.
Imagine that

949
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:27,820
because testosterone is so controlling
and limiting in that sense.

950
00:56:27,821 --> 00:56:32,800
Like there's so much ego bound
to testosterone and also the,

951
00:56:32,801 --> 00:56:35,380
the mortality of testosterone,

952
00:56:35,381 --> 00:56:37,860
like being the one that
survives and all that,

953
00:56:37,861 --> 00:56:42,790
it is inexorably sort of connected to
the, the, the sex hormone over the mail.

954
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:44,890
I would imagine that that
would be more limiting.

955
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,870
Emily has a better meditator than I am.

956
00:56:46,871 --> 00:56:49,870
I practice twice as hard and
experience half the results.

957
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:54,640
Do you guys ever go in a sensory
deprivation tanks? I have not done that.

958
00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:57,400
I haven't done that yet. How
dare both of you, I know,

959
00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:01,150
I know it's such a confusing thing to
me because I've been such an advocate on

960
00:57:01,151 --> 00:57:03,960
the sensory deprivation tank and I
talked to so many people that are into

961
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:08,970
meditation and like how do you not use
the one tool that is essentially like

962
00:57:09,521 --> 00:57:14,070
designed for the best meditation
possible? Well retreats, you know, we,

963
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:17,680
we've both done a lot of months of
intensive retreat and it's kind of like

964
00:57:17,681 --> 00:57:22,250
sensory deprivation. I mean you don't
talk, you don't, um, you know, you,

965
00:57:22,251 --> 00:57:26,080
you eat what's in front of
you. You, you're sitting in
silence most of the time.

966
00:57:26,081 --> 00:57:30,670
It like, it really does limit the
sensory input. Um, and you know,

967
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:35,050
I've been in states of consciousness
where all sensory input sort of disappears

968
00:57:35,051 --> 00:57:35,530
for awhile.

969
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:39,130
So I feel like I've had that experience
of how could you say that though if you

970
00:57:39,131 --> 00:57:42,250
haven't done it, if you haven't
done the actual tank itself? Oh,

971
00:57:42,251 --> 00:57:43,990
I don't know how it compares exactly,

972
00:57:43,991 --> 00:57:47,680
but I know what it's like to experience
a lack of sensory input. Right.

973
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:50,980
Until you sign a certain level
and a certain level that you know,

974
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,070
there's no sense of visual sight sound.

975
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:58,480
It's actually probably deeper because
there's no sense of the body at all in

976
00:57:58,481 --> 00:58:02,770
those states. It's completely
formless, um, deeper than what?

977
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:07,000
Deeper than if you're laying in a tank
and you still have an experience of the

978
00:58:07,001 --> 00:58:10,060
senses of your body.
Like if you can still feel your body,

979
00:58:10,061 --> 00:58:13,210
can you feel your body in
a sensory denomination? No,
that's the whole point. Okay,

980
00:58:13,211 --> 00:58:17,140
so it's probably similar. More
intense. This is why I've done both.

981
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:20,980
And the sensory deprivation tank,
you're weightless, we'll have to do it.

982
00:58:21,010 --> 00:58:24,070
You're floating in water. That's the
same, the temperatures of your skin.

983
00:58:24,071 --> 00:58:26,920
So you don't recognize where
the water ends and the, your,

984
00:58:26,921 --> 00:58:30,790
your body completely ceases to
send information to you. Yeah.

985
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:33,700
And if you guys are
already good at meditating,

986
00:58:33,701 --> 00:58:36,910
meditating in a tank would be like
turbo charged probably, right?

987
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:40,520
100% guaranteed.
I can't believe you haven't done it,

988
00:58:40,521 --> 00:58:44,560
but why don't you have a sponsor yet
for for uh, I sent in my basement.

989
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:48,040
I have a tank in my basement.
I go in that soccer all the time.

990
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,540
You need a new advertiser here.

991
00:58:49,541 --> 00:58:54,130
I think I could sort of help my frank
crash who owns a, the float lab in Venice,

992
00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:57,100
but I don't do it for
financial compensation.

993
00:58:57,101 --> 00:59:00,340
I just do it because I want people
to know about it. But I would, I do,

994
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:05,080
I retweet people's tanks all the time that
I have no affiliation with whatsoever.

995
00:59:05,081 --> 00:59:05,914
Just cause I think it's an,

996
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:10,510
it's a massively important tool that is
somehow or another slipped through the

997
00:59:10,511 --> 00:59:14,290
fingers of, of our, our,
our consciousness. I don't,

998
00:59:14,291 --> 00:59:17,350
I don't get how people haven't grabbed
a hold of that and ran with it.

999
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:19,540
I read a study one time
that says a lot of people,

1000
00:59:19,541 --> 00:59:22,250
once they have some sort of opening,
we could call

1001
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:25,540
it mystical experience, for lack
of a better word right now, um,

1002
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:29,660
that a lot of people don't want to have
him again after they've had it the first

1003
00:59:29,661 --> 00:59:33,390
time. Something about the opening
kind of freaks people out. Um,

1004
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:39,770
but I'm just saying, yeah, I mean
that and it can be scary for people.

1005
00:59:39,771 --> 00:59:44,600
So it seems like the
expansion of consciousness is
something that is naturally

1006
00:59:44,601 --> 00:59:45,500
in us as well.

1007
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:48,770
And so thinking about the technology where
we started this conversation a little

1008
00:59:48,771 --> 00:59:49,011
bit,

1009
00:59:49,011 --> 00:59:54,011
it's like there is this impulse to
explore and to like expand and upload into

1010
00:59:55,491 --> 00:59:58,400
different states and realms of being.

1011
00:59:58,810 --> 01:00:03,340
But that fear of expansion,
that's just, that's just the ego,

1012
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:04,330
that's all that is.

1013
01:00:04,331 --> 01:00:09,070
That's just your body trying to
reclaim like some sort of walls.

1014
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:09,581
What's,

1015
01:00:09,581 --> 01:00:13,990
let's put boundaries on this sucker so
we can clearly defined it where you know,

1016
01:00:13,991 --> 01:00:15,820
when you have a psychedelic experience,

1017
01:00:15,821 --> 01:00:20,110
one of the things that's the most talked
about aspect of it is the boundary

1018
01:00:20,111 --> 01:00:24,220
dissolving aspect of it.
That the boundaries all dissolve.

1019
01:00:24,221 --> 01:00:26,690
And like I remember one of
the first times that I did a,

1020
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:31,060
a really potent psychedelic
was five Meo DMT.

1021
01:00:31,061 --> 01:00:36,061
And the overwhelming message from it was
that there's no up and there's no down

1022
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,580
and that you're just a part of the,
the infinite.

1023
01:00:39,730 --> 01:00:44,730
And that feeling is very
like saying it like this is,

1024
01:00:45,161 --> 01:00:48,250
it sounds like just a bunch of noise
coming out of your mouth that sort of

1025
01:00:48,251 --> 01:00:50,860
vaguely represents what
this concept would be.

1026
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:56,130
But experiencing it in a psychedelic
state was so overwhelmingly educational.

1027
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:58,300
And so,
um,

1028
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:03,790
it was so boundary defining like whatever
I had thought of as a boundary in the

1029
01:01:03,791 --> 01:01:06,310
past was now like,
oh,

1030
01:01:06,311 --> 01:01:09,280
that was just this and
this is just that and what,

1031
01:01:09,310 --> 01:01:14,310
what you really are is one thing that is
holding all these other things that are

1032
01:01:15,641 --> 01:01:20,320
all a part of this huge thing.
And this huge thing is you're in it.

1033
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:23,020
You're not separate.
I'm not separate from you.

1034
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:28,210
You and I are these containers
that are inside of this.

1035
01:01:28,270 --> 01:01:32,080
There's air and there's, there's
always something there. There's no,

1036
01:01:32,110 --> 01:01:35,560
there's no nothing. It doesn't
exist. There's no nothing,

1037
01:01:35,590 --> 01:01:37,990
there's no nothing anywhere.
Even nothing is something.

1038
01:01:38,410 --> 01:01:41,320
Yeah, no. Shinzen young, one
of our favorite teachers,

1039
01:01:41,321 --> 01:01:44,680
he says emptiness is not a thing.
It's a pure doing.

1040
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:48,670
Which is sort of another way of saying,
I think what you're pointing to,

1041
01:01:48,790 --> 01:01:52,370
that everything is just happening
as it is. And there's no, um,

1042
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:56,860
in a sense there's no thing that
even goes beyond all of that.

1043
01:01:56,890 --> 01:02:00,250
It's just this, you know, it's just
this happening that's happening.

1044
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:03,710
Universe also is like a soup.
It's not like a,

1045
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:06,630
you're not throwing a ball through
the air and someone's catching it.

1046
01:02:06,631 --> 01:02:10,770
It's not hitting anything. It's not a
vacuum. Like the whole thing is just,

1047
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:14,670
it's filled with something.
It's all connected. Like you,

1048
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:19,200
you and I aren't really separate from
each other. We're just not touching skin,

1049
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:22,900
but we're touching something that's
touching us. It's in that, you know,

1050
01:02:23,270 --> 01:02:28,110
we're all feeling that, boy, that
sounds hippy. Ooh, that's Hippie Shit.

1051
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:30,990
But it's, but it's also true. Yeah.

1052
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:35,910
In some way it's also true.
And that these, these ideas,

1053
01:02:35,911 --> 01:02:40,911
whether it's meditation or yoga or
psychedelics or these ideas of mindfulness

1054
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,410
are in a lot of ways an attempt
to escape this monkey realm,

1055
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:50,430
to escape this biological realm that
we find ourselves in, to try to,

1056
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:55,410
if not escape it,
rather, um, to manage it.

1057
01:02:55,470 --> 01:02:59,490
Transform it. Yes. I would say
transform it to what though?

1058
01:03:02,410 --> 01:03:06,340
I don't have a good answer to what kind
of looping back around where we started

1059
01:03:06,341 --> 01:03:07,600
this conversation to what

1060
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:11,390
right. Isn't that like building
a house and you don't have plans?

1061
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:12,021
Like what are you doing?

1062
01:03:12,021 --> 01:03:15,980
I'm just putting shingles on this thing
and it's going to hopefully be something

1063
01:03:16,310 --> 01:03:19,010
I think, I think, uh, having,
I mean, I think there,

1064
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:22,370
there we each have to answer
that question too. What I mean,

1065
01:03:22,371 --> 01:03:24,590
and that's a very personal thing.
And that way you think, I mean,

1066
01:03:24,591 --> 01:03:28,730
I think it's personal in one way, but
it's also collective in another way. Um,

1067
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:30,320
because we, you know, we,

1068
01:03:30,321 --> 01:03:34,340
we influence each other and
we get attracted to things
that are connected with

1069
01:03:34,341 --> 01:03:38,840
what's important to us. Um, but
you know, to me, to what, you know,

1070
01:03:38,841 --> 01:03:41,600
I think what's beautiful is, you know, to,

1071
01:03:41,601 --> 01:03:43,970
to move toward deep percents of wisdom to,

1072
01:03:43,971 --> 01:03:48,260
to move toward being able to live
in harmony with that realization of

1073
01:03:48,261 --> 01:03:49,700
interconnectivity of deep,

1074
01:03:50,270 --> 01:03:53,270
of that after kind of profound
interconnectivity that you're describing,

1075
01:03:53,271 --> 01:03:53,451
you know,

1076
01:03:53,451 --> 01:03:58,430
that literally that at some level
isn't a separation between us.

1077
01:03:58,630 --> 01:04:03,500
You know, w how does that then inform how
I live? How does that change how I live?

1078
01:04:03,501 --> 01:04:04,880
Do I sort of say,
oh,

1079
01:04:04,881 --> 01:04:08,960
well what's the fucking point and
just give up or do I, you know,

1080
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:14,050
take that experience and
begin to dismantle habits and,

1081
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:19,670
and ideas and beliefs that are opposed
to that experience and actually begin to

1082
01:04:19,671 --> 01:04:21,870
live more in harmony to,
you know,

1083
01:04:22,130 --> 01:04:25,550
in the kind of language of contemplative
training to embody that realization,

1084
01:04:25,551 --> 01:04:28,010
to make it your own, um, you know,

1085
01:04:28,011 --> 01:04:31,790
end to end to make your life and
expression of that an expression of that

1086
01:04:31,791 --> 01:04:34,690
interconnectivity and compassionate and,
um,

1087
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:38,390
deep care and love for each
other and including, you know,

1088
01:04:38,391 --> 01:04:41,870
cutting through all the bullshit and
including calling out the delusion,

1089
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:45,260
you know, including, you know,
pimp smacking the bullshit,

1090
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:49,160
which is I think a big part of,
you know, what I see you doing here

1091
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:52,490
and have it just say, leaving room
for the what to change. You know,

1092
01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:55,640
that's not like a fixed thing that
we're going to transform into this fixed

1093
01:04:55,641 --> 01:04:58,730
thing. We're going to continue
to, to change and to evolve.

1094
01:04:59,510 --> 01:05:00,830
And so that's beautiful to me,

1095
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:04,110
Jen. Certainly beautiful from a
biological standpoint. I mean I'm,

1096
01:05:04,111 --> 01:05:08,900
I'm not a cynic in that I don't love life
and I don't love humans cause I, I, I,

1097
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:12,950
I enjoy this experience incredibly. I
thought, I think it's an amazing time.

1098
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:16,370
I think being a person is
great. I love it. I love people.

1099
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:19,090
I love all fun things
you could do as a person.

1100
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:23,020
But what I'm trying to get to,
when we were talking,

1101
01:05:23,021 --> 01:05:24,490
transhumanism and this,

1102
01:05:24,491 --> 01:05:28,210
I'm escaping the boundaries of biology.

1103
01:05:29,110 --> 01:05:31,960
There's a guy that we talked about in
this podcast before they got bitten by a

1104
01:05:31,961 --> 01:05:33,580
shark.
So Australian cat,

1105
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:37,670
he lost his arm and his leg
and they replaced it with
this carbon fiber creation

1106
01:05:37,671 --> 01:05:39,190
and he's moving around.
He's standing there,

1107
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:43,600
no limp guy walks around normal
has his hand that, you know,

1108
01:05:43,601 --> 01:05:48,160
it's kind of crude, but it does move and
it can pick things up. And I'm like, wow,

1109
01:05:48,161 --> 01:05:51,250
this is quite fascinating. Like
they said to this guy, hey,

1110
01:05:51,670 --> 01:05:55,030
I know you got your arm and leg put
off by shark, but lucky for you,

1111
01:05:55,031 --> 01:06:00,031
this is 2014 and we have some incredible
innovation that we've created that's

1112
01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:05,670
going to allow you to have this leg that
moves very much like a regular leg and

1113
01:06:06,581 --> 01:06:09,520
you're going to have a hand that can do
a lot of things that a regular hand can

1114
01:06:09,521 --> 01:06:13,870
do. So that's better than not having
that arm and leg and yes, and guess what?

1115
01:06:13,871 --> 01:06:15,370
It's going to get better.
Five years from now.

1116
01:06:15,371 --> 01:06:18,880
We'll have a better arm and a better leg
and you're going to enjoy this. Well,

1117
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:21,730
if as time goes on,

1118
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:25,630
the other parts of his body start
failing like a, you know what man?

1119
01:06:25,631 --> 01:06:27,910
There's problem because you
have this artificial right leg.

1120
01:06:27,911 --> 01:06:29,200
Your left knee is gone.

1121
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,930
So we're going to replace your left
leg too with this artificial leg.

1122
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:34,300
So this way you'll have two
artificial legs and they're,

1123
01:06:34,301 --> 01:06:38,110
but they're going to work
great. Okay, great. Okay,
listen man, your heart is going.

1124
01:06:38,470 --> 01:06:40,030
Uh,
but good news.

1125
01:06:40,150 --> 01:06:44,710
We have an artificial heart and we're
going to take this artificial and a

1126
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:44,711
hundred years from now,

1127
01:06:44,711 --> 01:06:49,711
this guy is just a brain
in this carbon fiber body.

1128
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:52,120
And he's looking at his eyes.

1129
01:06:52,150 --> 01:06:55,510
He's looking through these artificially
created eyes and they say, listen,

1130
01:06:55,900 --> 01:07:00,640
everything works great except the
cells of your brain are reproducing

1131
01:07:00,641 --> 01:07:03,190
irregularly and you're going
to develop Parkinson's.

1132
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:08,250
But we have figured out a way to download
your consciousness into an artificial

1133
01:07:08,321 --> 01:07:09,040
brain.

1134
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:12,520
So we'll just download your consciousness
into this art in the well what's left

1135
01:07:12,521 --> 01:07:14,650
of you? You don't, there's nothing.

1136
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:19,830
There's no biology anymore and well
what's there then when you sit there like

1137
01:07:21,030 --> 01:07:24,280
they turn that switch on and your,
you know,

1138
01:07:24,610 --> 01:07:27,910
2.0 what,
what goes on there?

1139
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:32,040
Well, from a, from a Buddhist perspective,
what's there is your, is your Karma.

1140
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:36,630
What's there is the pattern that was
you leading up to that point. You know,

1141
01:07:36,631 --> 01:07:41,580
the information that made you up and
that has continued to move into this new

1142
01:07:41,710 --> 01:07:46,290
sub straight. Um, and that
pattern has a momentum to it.

1143
01:07:46,590 --> 01:07:50,040
It has, uh, a history. It has memories,

1144
01:07:50,070 --> 01:07:54,210
has beliefs. It has, you know, it
has various things. It doesn't,

1145
01:07:54,211 --> 01:07:58,680
it's not a complete discontinuity. Um,
the substrates changed. But the, uh,

1146
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:01,470
you know, the pattern has
continued in some sense, right?

1147
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:06,490
Maybe, but how much of that pattern
is based on biological need?

1148
01:08:06,491 --> 01:08:11,491
How much of that pattern is based on
this cultural conditioning and the,

1149
01:08:12,761 --> 01:08:16,010
the, just the patterns of behavior
that you've adopted along the way

1150
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:19,160
and your life and the,
the environment in which you grew up in.

1151
01:08:20,030 --> 01:08:25,030
How much of that goes away when you have
a brain that's made out of fibers that

1152
01:08:25,131 --> 01:08:28,670
are constructed out of silicon and,
or whatever?

1153
01:08:29,270 --> 01:08:31,530
Depends on how it's constructed.
This reminds me of them.

1154
01:08:31,610 --> 01:08:34,520
I don't know if you've had the experience
in some of my teachers talk about this

1155
01:08:34,850 --> 01:08:39,430
as an example. A lot is, um, you know,
looking in the mirror now and you,

1156
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:41,930
you kind of get surprised that,
that you've aged,

1157
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:44,660
but there's something in you
that you don't feel as aged.

1158
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:49,280
Do you ever have that experience? I do.
In what way? It's just like, you know,

1159
01:08:49,281 --> 01:08:50,114
you just,

1160
01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:55,160
there's part of you that has an
age and then at the same time,

1161
01:08:55,161 --> 01:08:59,540
if you look in the mirror, you can tell
that you've aged. Does that make sense?

1162
01:08:59,990 --> 01:09:03,110
There's a piece of us, right?
That's like, I don't know,

1163
01:09:03,111 --> 01:09:08,000
I still feel like nothing's changed
inside, inside your vehicle, but my feet,

1164
01:09:08,001 --> 01:09:10,580
but then I look in the mirror and I'm
like, oh my gosh. Yeah. Like I gotta,

1165
01:09:10,581 --> 01:09:14,390
I gotta have my time is taken even though
I'm young, you know? But I, I get that.

1166
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:17,270
So there's this like
paradox kind of at play.

1167
01:09:17,870 --> 01:09:22,730
So when we're talking about like what
if we do upload or what is it that is

1168
01:09:22,731 --> 01:09:25,520
still there? Like I wonder if
some of that will still be there,

1169
01:09:25,550 --> 01:09:27,980
that feeling of nothing's changed.

1170
01:09:28,490 --> 01:09:31,670
And then there is this change
that happens when we age and

1171
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:35,280
well, if we'd stop aging, I mean if the,

1172
01:09:35,281 --> 01:09:39,200
if it completely ends or
if it's a temporary aging,

1173
01:09:39,201 --> 01:09:42,320
we just got to go and get
repainted, you know? I mean,

1174
01:09:42,650 --> 01:09:45,650
if your car gets a Patina from,
you know,

1175
01:09:45,830 --> 01:09:47,960
rocks and chips on the road and stop,

1176
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:51,920
all you have to do is bring to the body
shop and the old cars that look awesome.

1177
01:09:52,190 --> 01:09:56,600
You know, we can't do that
with a human being. But if
we can, if there's, you know,

1178
01:09:56,601 --> 01:10:01,070
there's companies that specialize in
replacing every single part of an old car

1179
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:06,430
and creating you a new version of an old
car that that is ultimately incredibly

1180
01:10:06,951 --> 01:10:11,090
possible for a human being. I think
that's possible. That's crazy though.

1181
01:10:12,290 --> 01:10:16,890
You know, and there is this part of
us that wants to live forever. I mean,

1182
01:10:16,891 --> 01:10:21,030
the holy grail, like some of these
myths that existed for a long time. So

1183
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:25,130
everybody wants to sleep, but
nobody wants to die. Yeah.

1184
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:29,270
It's quite fascinating. Everybody's more
than happy to shut off for eight hours.

1185
01:10:29,271 --> 01:10:31,670
Like, Oh yeah, here we go. Nothing

1186
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:37,900
I find bizarre. It's like,
I find it bizarre now is,

1187
01:10:38,740 --> 01:10:43,720
I mean a lot of the fear of death seems
to be connected to a fear of the unknown

1188
01:10:43,810 --> 01:10:48,580
of what would happen after death. Like,
am I just going to disappear? You know,

1189
01:10:48,581 --> 01:10:50,720
what's going to happen?
Um,

1190
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:55,120
and not knowing that is part of,
I think of the terror,

1191
01:10:55,180 --> 01:10:57,280
the feeling of not knowing
what's going to happen.

1192
01:10:57,610 --> 01:11:00,850
And what I find interesting is, you
know, and we were just talking to her,

1193
01:11:00,851 --> 01:11:04,540
one of our zen teachers who, who teach
us here in Santa Monica, she pointed out,

1194
01:11:04,570 --> 01:11:09,010
you know, in every moment we actually
don't know what's coming next. You know,

1195
01:11:09,011 --> 01:11:13,000
that not knowing it, it's something
we're constantly having to deal with.

1196
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:15,780
The terror of not
knowing, uh, or you know,

1197
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:19,110
as her zen teacher called it
the don't know mind, you know?

1198
01:11:19,111 --> 01:11:24,111
And so I find it interesting to kind of
reflect on what it's like to rest in the

1199
01:11:25,591 --> 01:11:27,420
not knowing to rest in that,

1200
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:31,140
that sense of not knowing
what's gonna come next.

1201
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:32,760
Because in that moment,

1202
01:11:32,761 --> 01:11:37,590
every next moment is both a death of
this moment and the rebirth of something

1203
01:11:37,591 --> 01:11:41,430
new. There's something new coming online
and there's something disappearing.

1204
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:42,481
And in that sense,

1205
01:11:42,481 --> 01:11:46,170
I think if we become comfortable and
familiar with that process of moment by

1206
01:11:46,171 --> 01:11:49,830
moment, birth and death, then
you know, whatever happens,

1207
01:11:49,831 --> 01:11:53,340
whether my consciousness gets
uploaded to the cloud or I die,

1208
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:58,500
there's some sense of there's some part
of me which is fundamentally okay with

1209
01:11:58,530 --> 01:12:01,260
that death process,
that the constant dying.

1210
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:05,160
And that was the thing I always thought
was funky about the attempt to escape

1211
01:12:05,161 --> 01:12:08,580
death.
Because actually in order to escape death,

1212
01:12:08,581 --> 01:12:11,910
we're going to have to go through so
many deaths of who we think we are.

1213
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:14,090
You know, like you're
saying, you know, to, to,

1214
01:12:14,140 --> 01:12:19,140
to transplant your consciousness into a
silicon brain like some part of you dies

1215
01:12:19,441 --> 01:12:23,850
in that. And so we're trying to escape
death by running into it headlong.

1216
01:12:24,210 --> 01:12:28,440
Well also what if death is
merely a transitionary phase?

1217
01:12:28,441 --> 01:12:31,380
What if you are,
you live in this existence,

1218
01:12:31,381 --> 01:12:34,470
but when you die you will
enter into a new existence.

1219
01:12:34,710 --> 01:12:39,710
And this is what many ancient religions
have speculated on throughout the

1220
01:12:39,751 --> 01:12:41,970
beginning of time. I mean,
since the beginning of time,

1221
01:12:42,390 --> 01:12:44,760
everyone thinks that there's some sort of,
I mean,

1222
01:12:44,761 --> 01:12:48,180
whether it's wishful thinking or
whatever it is, it might be real.

1223
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:51,540
Just like consciousness is a very
bizarre thing to try to define,

1224
01:12:51,541 --> 01:12:53,690
but it is certainly a real thing.
You know,

1225
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:57,450
if you tried to put consciousness
in a lab and say like, what is it?

1226
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,520
What is it that causes creativity?

1227
01:12:59,521 --> 01:13:04,440
What is it that would define love in some
sort of a chemical process? No. Well,

1228
01:13:04,441 --> 01:13:08,220
good luck with that. You know? Good luck
with trying to figure out why. What that,

1229
01:13:08,221 --> 01:13:10,920
what that warm feeling is when you
see your friend at the airport,

1230
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:14,350
no time magazine cover that
says that you couldn't,

1231
01:13:14,351 --> 01:13:17,610
they couldn't find the God particle.
Do you remember that? Yeah.

1232
01:13:17,710 --> 01:13:19,870
In the brain they can't find it.
Yeah.

1233
01:13:20,290 --> 01:13:23,320
Well, what is it? You
know, what, what, what is,

1234
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:26,980
there's so many different
aspects to what is life? What,

1235
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:31,600
what defines this existence for the
person who experiences at themselves and

1236
01:13:31,601 --> 01:13:35,140
does that transition to something
else at the moment of death?

1237
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:37,300
And is that why the brain,

1238
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:41,440
it produces all these
indigenous psychedelic
chemicals that give you when you

1239
01:13:41,441 --> 01:13:45,550
take them, give you this elated
sense of being, give you this,

1240
01:13:45,770 --> 01:13:50,770
this sense of relieving of anxiety and
this sense of connection to everything

1241
01:13:51,431 --> 01:13:55,660
and everything. Every one that
exists, like what? Why do those exist?

1242
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:59,110
Like why are those chemicals in the
mind and why are those chemicals,

1243
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:02,350
why they released at the moment of death,
why they release it?

1244
01:14:02,351 --> 01:14:05,500
The moment of extreme stress when
your body's worried it's going to die.

1245
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:08,410
Why those released during the dream state?
Like what?

1246
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:13,500
What is that and would we be trapping
whatever consciousness we have now in this

1247
01:14:14,141 --> 01:14:15,430
artificial creation.

1248
01:14:15,430 --> 01:14:19,360
If you can download consciousness
into some artificial creation,

1249
01:14:19,361 --> 01:14:23,800
is that a hellish existence for that
consciousness because it's no longer able

1250
01:14:23,801 --> 01:14:27,730
to transition to the next phase of being
and would you be able to transition to

1251
01:14:27,731 --> 01:14:32,200
that next phase phase of being as a
biological entity and then realize like,

1252
01:14:32,201 --> 01:14:34,210
oh my God,
what did I do with my consciousness?

1253
01:14:34,211 --> 01:14:37,930
I left it back there in that fucking robot
and who and who would be conscious of

1254
01:14:37,931 --> 01:14:42,590
that? If there was no conscious.
Yeah. Well what is it? What you know,

1255
01:14:42,610 --> 01:14:47,410
what is that thing? What is the life, what
is the life that gets that transitions.

1256
01:14:47,411 --> 01:14:52,270
The life expires, the, the light
goes out and you pass over.

1257
01:14:52,271 --> 01:14:57,271
But yet this robot wakes up and
it's you and it has no lifespan.

1258
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:02,770
You know, it has no whatever
it, no sexual urges.

1259
01:15:02,771 --> 01:15:07,710
No need for community is just this thing
that has all of your memories. Yeah.

1260
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:13,060
I hope you don't design the future Ai.
Well we have real problems.

1261
01:15:13,061 --> 01:15:17,500
If we design it to mimic and
replicate biological life,

1262
01:15:17,650 --> 01:15:21,400
we have real problems there.
We'd have real problems if we didn't too.

1263
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:26,650
That's true as well. Will the biological
us would. Yeah. Cause we would, you know,

1264
01:15:26,651 --> 01:15:29,020
that's where the terminator comes to.
It has no need for us.

1265
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:34,640
What's it's why everything that we are
as far as what the way our society is

1266
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:39,640
structured as far as the, our senses
of fairness and love and compassion.

1267
01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:43,120
They're all based on
biological urges and needs.

1268
01:15:43,150 --> 01:15:47,140
The need for community is a strong
urge to keep us all together.

1269
01:15:47,141 --> 01:15:50,410
So we stay alive longer. I
mean, all of these things are,

1270
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:55,360
they're a part of being a biological
entity. And when we no longer are,

1271
01:15:56,080 --> 01:16:01,080
why would we engineer all of those
biological urges and thoughts and concepts

1272
01:16:01,091 --> 01:16:04,180
into this carbon fiber creation?

1273
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:08,140
I've heard the argument, and I think
this is interesting too though,

1274
01:16:08,141 --> 01:16:09,040
that you know,

1275
01:16:09,070 --> 01:16:13,810
the need for community goes back to the
very earliest moments of the universe.

1276
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:18,940
You know, that in some sense, you know,
when Adams, uh, when Adam has emerged,

1277
01:16:18,970 --> 01:16:20,740
they emerged in collectives,
you know,

1278
01:16:20,741 --> 01:16:22,960
that they didn't just
emerge as a single atom,

1279
01:16:23,290 --> 01:16:26,280
that they're always wins
when a single thing emerges.

1280
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:30,360
It emerges also with a collective, you
know, in that sense, you know, the,

1281
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:34,810
the sense of community is hardwired
maybe into the universe itself,

1282
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:39,610
but isn't also the sense of competition
then because all biological life is this

1283
01:16:39,790 --> 01:16:44,590
wild race of things, eating
things, letting vegetarians,

1284
01:16:44,591 --> 01:16:44,831
I mean,

1285
01:16:44,831 --> 01:16:48,070
the whole idea is as things grow and
these other things come along and eat them

1286
01:16:48,071 --> 01:16:52,570
as they grow and there's no way
around it, life eats life, you know,

1287
01:16:52,571 --> 01:16:57,571
and you can try to keep your biological
footprint as small as possible.

1288
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:03,460
And do as little harm as possible,
but every step you take is killing life.

1289
01:17:03,790 --> 01:17:07,840
Every time you close your mouth, you're
killing bacteria. I mean, you're,

1290
01:17:07,841 --> 01:17:10,100
you're doing,
when you wash yourself,

1291
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:15,080
you're killing living things
is a lot of weirdness to this,

1292
01:17:15,350 --> 01:17:19,280
this whole life that is tied to survival,

1293
01:17:19,430 --> 01:17:24,430
tied to birth death and the prolonging
of the species or the improvement of the

1294
01:17:25,791 --> 01:17:29,450
species as it tries to
prolong. Absolutely. I mean,

1295
01:17:29,990 --> 01:17:31,220
it's a paradox to,
yeah,

1296
01:17:32,570 --> 01:17:35,960
but that's isn't that part of what's
cool about being alive is that it's not

1297
01:17:35,961 --> 01:17:37,790
gonna last.
I mean that's,

1298
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:42,050
that's the one of the big issues
with the transhumanist movement,

1299
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:46,940
this idea of transcending the biological
limitations and living forever, but,

1300
01:17:47,030 --> 01:17:50,660
but then it sucks. It's like a movie
that's a hundred hours long. You know,

1301
01:17:50,661 --> 01:17:52,730
I don't want to see star
wars for a hundred hours.

1302
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:56,300
I want to see star wars for two hours
because at the end of two hours,

1303
01:17:56,301 --> 01:17:59,300
it's awesome. Like that
was a great movie. Yay.

1304
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:01,220
You walk outside and
you're in the sunlight.

1305
01:18:01,221 --> 01:18:04,610
You talk about how great that moment was
with your friends. Everybody's happy.

1306
01:18:04,820 --> 01:18:09,770
But if star wars is goes on for infinity,
it fucking sucks, you know, for, you know,

1307
01:18:09,890 --> 01:18:14,240
a hundred years later it's still going
warp speed and Chewbacca is like fucking

1308
01:18:14,241 --> 01:18:18,590
get me Outta here. This is terrible.
This movie sucks. You know why?

1309
01:18:18,591 --> 01:18:21,260
Because it's boring. I don't want
to see it for a hundred hours.

1310
01:18:21,261 --> 01:18:24,200
I want to see it for two.
Is that life itself,

1311
01:18:25,230 --> 01:18:28,020
I mean the, the question
I would ask is, you know,

1312
01:18:28,050 --> 01:18:32,730
is it true that there will be no
limitations if we transcend our biological

1313
01:18:32,731 --> 01:18:36,930
limitations or is it the case that
there'll be new limitations that we can't

1314
01:18:36,931 --> 01:18:40,950
fathom? You know, that
become again, and this,

1315
01:18:41,010 --> 01:18:44,760
this ties in with the question that
we've asked ourselves, you know, with,

1316
01:18:44,761 --> 01:18:45,261
with the,

1317
01:18:45,261 --> 01:18:49,770
the Buddhist practice like
is enlightenment and end
state or is it an ongoing

1318
01:18:49,950 --> 01:18:53,220
ever unfolding process? You
know, and I think if it,

1319
01:18:53,221 --> 01:18:55,650
if it is an unfolding
ever evolving process,

1320
01:18:55,651 --> 01:19:00,000
then that means there will always be,
as long as there's stuff,

1321
01:19:00,330 --> 01:19:01,740
there will always be limitations.

1322
01:19:01,741 --> 01:19:06,240
There always be something that's
not quite as perfect as it could be.

1323
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:10,980
Um, or that you know, is not
quite it. And so in that sense,

1324
01:19:10,981 --> 01:19:12,060
I would guess that,

1325
01:19:12,390 --> 01:19:15,890
I mean this is my guess is not that we
would transcend limitations altogether,

1326
01:19:15,930 --> 01:19:19,260
but that will transcend certain ones
and then discover new ones and then the

1327
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:23,020
whole process of creative tension.
We'll begin again at some new, you know,

1328
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:24,920
level and we'll be like, oh shit. Like I,

1329
01:19:25,350 --> 01:19:30,240
I really don't appreciate the fact
that I can't have two experiences

1330
01:19:30,241 --> 01:19:32,760
simultaneously that I've done.
There's this one experience.

1331
01:19:32,761 --> 01:19:35,370
Even if I can move between
multiple realms really rapidly,

1332
01:19:35,490 --> 01:19:39,780
I still can only have this one moment
of experience, you know, then what I am.

1333
01:19:39,781 --> 01:19:40,614
That's just a guess.

1334
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:44,190
Maybe one of the limitations. Well that's
fascinating. What do you bring that up?

1335
01:19:44,191 --> 01:19:48,750
Because that, that does open up a
different realm of possibilities.

1336
01:19:48,751 --> 01:19:53,490
If we can transcend the limitations of
biology and that includes experiencing

1337
01:19:53,491 --> 01:19:58,350
multiple things simultaneously or the
ability to experience multiple lives.

1338
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:03,480
Like if we figure out a way to combine
our consciousness or whatever we call our

1339
01:20:03,481 --> 01:20:04,314
consciousness,

1340
01:20:04,350 --> 01:20:09,330
once we transcend biological life
and combined our minds so that we do

1341
01:20:09,331 --> 01:20:12,210
experience the lives of multiple people,

1342
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:16,200
if not the entire human race
that's on the same track,

1343
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:21,300
experience it all simultaneously and
that that this is beyond the realm of

1344
01:20:21,510 --> 01:20:26,510
biological understanding and maybe that's
where we evolve from this thing and

1345
01:20:27,121 --> 01:20:30,180
become something that's far
more complex and complicated

1346
01:20:31,490 --> 01:20:32,490
in less in less.

1347
01:20:32,491 --> 01:20:35,730
One aspect of that decides it doesn't
want to be merged into the hole and then

1348
01:20:35,731 --> 01:20:37,320
you get warring factions or

1349
01:20:39,090 --> 01:20:40,750
Warren fraction problems.

1350
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:46,230
Much larger scale warring factions of
transhumanism is trying to pull each

1351
01:20:46,231 --> 01:20:50,550
other's batteries out and trying to pull
each other into each other's version of

1352
01:20:50,551 --> 01:20:53,280
utopia. Yeah, right. Oh,
that's another issue, right?

1353
01:20:53,281 --> 01:20:56,810
Like what if there's like a Mac
version and a windows version and a non

1354
01:20:56,811 --> 01:20:57,780
compatible,

1355
01:20:58,280 --> 01:20:59,400
everyone's trying to figure out what,

1356
01:20:59,450 --> 01:21:03,530
which one is going to be the Beta Max and
which one, you know Betamax was better,

1357
01:21:03,531 --> 01:21:08,060
but VHS survived and you've got to
pick the right team. That's right.

1358
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,340
Yeah. There's different. Yeah,

1359
01:21:10,341 --> 01:21:13,760
because it's not like there's going to
be only one company that comes up with a

1360
01:21:13,761 --> 01:21:15,230
transhumanist solution.
Right,

1361
01:21:15,460 --> 01:21:19,120
right. This is reminding me of like
the fluidity of it perspectives.

1362
01:21:19,180 --> 01:21:22,780
As I've trained in practice,
it's like the mind,

1363
01:21:23,290 --> 01:21:25,650
it has the capacity to take on multiple,

1364
01:21:25,930 --> 01:21:29,920
multiple perspectives and how important
that actually is in the world today to

1365
01:21:29,921 --> 01:21:34,840
be able to take different points of view
and take multiple perspectives and and

1366
01:21:34,841 --> 01:21:37,750
not have the right way or that way.

1367
01:21:38,470 --> 01:21:41,540
So there's a lot of
possibilities. Yeah. The

1368
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:46,020
you said also this fascinating
is this idea that we,

1369
01:21:46,050 --> 01:21:47,680
we can't even really

1370
01:21:49,210 --> 01:21:53,200
imagine what the potentials
are because the potentials,

1371
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:57,990
we'll create new potentials that
were before that, unrecognizable. We,

1372
01:21:58,060 --> 01:21:59,820
we didn't,
we didn't see them coming.

1373
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:04,300
Like if you went back in time a few
hundred years ago and tried to explain to

1374
01:22:04,301 --> 01:22:06,970
them the Internet, they'd be like,
what the fuck are you talking about?

1375
01:22:07,180 --> 01:22:11,380
If you went back before the printing press
and tried to explain the internet and

1376
01:22:11,381 --> 01:22:15,940
trying to access Google on your
phone with voice commands or Siri,

1377
01:22:16,330 --> 01:22:17,820
you know, Siri. Yeah.

1378
01:22:17,870 --> 01:22:21,790
Try to explain that to people that
live before printed type to be like,

1379
01:22:21,791 --> 01:22:23,530
what are you even yapping about?

1380
01:22:23,830 --> 01:22:28,450
They would never be able to wrap their
head around it much like we will never be

1381
01:22:28,451 --> 01:22:32,260
able to wrap our head around
the possibilities once we
transcend the biological

1382
01:22:32,261 --> 01:22:33,094
limitations.

1383
01:22:33,670 --> 01:22:37,870
The hive mind to me seems to be
the most likely the hivemind. Yeah.

1384
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:41,920
The idea that we're going to somehow or
another experience and experience each

1385
01:22:41,921 --> 01:22:46,750
other, uh, on some very, very broad scale,

1386
01:22:47,050 --> 01:22:49,360
some very large scale.

1387
01:22:49,750 --> 01:22:54,490
And I think we're kind of doing that
with shit like Facebook and with Twitter

1388
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:56,920
and with interaction on the Internet.

1389
01:22:56,950 --> 01:23:01,060
I think what we're doing is dipping
our toe in the ocean of connectivity.

1390
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:04,700
Oh yeah. I like that phrase.
Yeah. That's really good. Yeah.

1391
01:23:04,701 --> 01:23:09,701
Because think that we're slowly but
surely devolve or I'm dissolving or

1392
01:23:11,380 --> 01:23:16,030
developing maybe that suit biological
of all right. But dissolving these,

1393
01:23:16,050 --> 01:23:18,520
um,
limitations of communication,

1394
01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:21,980
we're slowly but surely
expressing ourselves in,

1395
01:23:21,981 --> 01:23:25,480
in ways and interacting in
ways that didn't exist before.

1396
01:23:25,481 --> 01:23:30,170
And then when new things come along, like
are you aware of Oculus rift? Yeah, sure.

1397
01:23:30,530 --> 01:23:33,850
I've got the Dev kit two waiting for
me in, in North Carolina. I can't wait.

1398
01:23:33,890 --> 01:23:34,780
Dunkin has it.

1399
01:23:35,020 --> 01:23:40,020
My friend Duncan Trussell has it and he
just got back from experiencing porn in

1400
01:23:40,470 --> 01:23:44,980
uh, in virtual reality, first
person porn and he goes,

1401
01:23:44,981 --> 01:23:48,080
it is the craziest thing you've
ever experienced in your life.

1402
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:51,180
Like you are this other person
having sex with someone.

1403
01:23:51,210 --> 01:23:52,720
You could look down at your body,

1404
01:23:52,721 --> 01:23:57,700
you can look at your feet and your
legs and you can experience like sexual

1405
01:23:57,701 --> 01:24:00,760
intercourse with somebody that you
don't feel it obviously, but he's like,

1406
01:24:00,761 --> 01:24:02,920
this is going to change the
entire world we live in.

1407
01:24:03,070 --> 01:24:07,650
And the new version of it is insanely
high definition. Right. And you know,

1408
01:24:07,660 --> 01:24:08,260
he keeps saying,
yeah,

1409
01:24:08,260 --> 01:24:11,830
you got to come over my house and
try out the fucking new rift. Man,

1410
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:13,060
it's mind blowing.

1411
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:16,160
He called me up the day he saw
it and he's like, he's like,

1412
01:24:16,161 --> 01:24:17,810
this is bigger than the Internet.
He goes,

1413
01:24:17,811 --> 01:24:20,540
this is bigger than anything that's
ever been invented by people. Yeah,

1414
01:24:20,690 --> 01:24:22,160
I've heard the same thing.
And I mean,

1415
01:24:22,161 --> 01:24:26,960
the thing I'm most excited
about is creating contemplative
training environments

1416
01:24:26,990 --> 01:24:31,250
in, in, in the rift. You know, what
would it be like to completely, you know,

1417
01:24:31,251 --> 01:24:34,190
like you said, immerse yourself
in a visual field, you know,

1418
01:24:34,191 --> 01:24:38,090
with nothing outside of it and be
able to, you know, in some sense, uh,

1419
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:42,260
experience some of the same states
that psychedelics burnout bring on,

1420
01:24:42,261 --> 01:24:45,590
but you know, directly through a
technological interface. You know,

1421
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,870
I'm one of my friends called
it techno deluxe. You know,

1422
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:52,070
that the sense that the technology could
produce some of the states as well.

1423
01:24:52,310 --> 01:24:53,150
Well,
that's what Mckenna,

1424
01:24:53,151 --> 01:24:58,151
his belief was sure about DMT is that
he believed that if you could create a

1425
01:25:00,321 --> 01:25:05,321
world that mimics exactly the psychedelic
experience of dimethyl trip to mean

1426
01:25:05,930 --> 01:25:08,720
that he believed that in that state,

1427
01:25:08,721 --> 01:25:12,980
those same beings that you interface
with when you take the psychedelic drugs

1428
01:25:13,220 --> 01:25:17,510
would show up. He had this like field of
dreams type scenario. If you build it,

1429
01:25:17,511 --> 01:25:22,511
they'll come and that that would be
the best case scenario for psychedelic

1430
01:25:23,181 --> 01:25:26,270
intervention. It wasn't getting
a bunch of people to take drugs.

1431
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:28,760
It's like put this on
virtual reality, this, yeah,

1432
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:31,940
that one day the state will,
I mean the,

1433
01:25:31,941 --> 01:25:34,510
the virtual reality will
achieve the, the, the,

1434
01:25:34,511 --> 01:25:38,930
the type of possibilities to achieve
something like that. Yeah. And then,

1435
01:25:38,931 --> 01:25:42,020
and then the question becomes, you know,
and I think Mckenna said this, you know,

1436
01:25:42,021 --> 01:25:46,400
what, what worlds do we build?
You know, what virtual reality is,

1437
01:25:46,401 --> 01:25:49,940
do we build and what values do we
build into them and program into them?

1438
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:52,400
You know, cause I don't think
that issue is going to go away.

1439
01:25:52,430 --> 01:25:57,350
We still have to ask this questions
and decide what we're building. Well,

1440
01:25:57,351 --> 01:26:02,030
again, that's the big, the
real mind. Fuck. It's, it's
not even essentially that, um,

1441
01:26:02,150 --> 01:26:04,430
you know, like we're going to
a different biological body,

1442
01:26:04,431 --> 01:26:08,510
but we might have a different reality
that is indistinguishable from this

1443
01:26:08,511 --> 01:26:11,550
reality that we can pick
up and put on a scale the,

1444
01:26:11,670 --> 01:26:16,670
the concept of virtual existence of some
sort of existence in a simulation as it

1445
01:26:19,851 --> 01:26:20,580
were.
You know,

1446
01:26:20,580 --> 01:26:24,920
the simulation is a weird word because
simulation implies that it's not real.

1447
01:26:25,130 --> 01:26:29,810
But if it has all the consequences and
all the feeling and textures and all the

1448
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:34,840
interactions and interfaces that you're
the regular life does as far as tactile,

1449
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:39,980
as far as heat sensitivity,
you all the different aspects of our life.

1450
01:26:39,981 --> 01:26:44,540
But we can recreate those. Exactly.
What is that? If it's not life,

1451
01:26:44,930 --> 01:26:48,660
I don't, I'm not. If it is
an experience and you're,

1452
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:53,680
you're taking in every single aspect of
that experience exactly the same way you

1453
01:26:53,721 --> 01:26:57,800
would take in this life, what
is it? And if that's the case,

1454
01:26:57,980 --> 01:27:00,020
how do we know we're not
all the already in it?

1455
01:27:00,530 --> 01:27:05,180
How do we know that this isn't good and
indistinguishable artificial reality

1456
01:27:05,330 --> 01:27:08,990
that we have created and we're just
tapped into this sucker? I mean,

1457
01:27:08,991 --> 01:27:11,900
that's my presumption that
we're in an artificial reality.

1458
01:27:11,970 --> 01:27:15,930
I mean, I, I presume this is a virtual
reality simulation. Yeah. Why is that?

1459
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:20,600
Because it,

1460
01:27:21,410 --> 01:27:25,610
because stuff's happening and
I don't know what's happening.

1461
01:27:26,430 --> 01:27:26,660
Okay.

1462
01:27:26,660 --> 01:27:27,493
What do you mean by that?

1463
01:27:29,990 --> 01:27:34,310
I mean, I guess we were watching
Nick Bostrom last night,

1464
01:27:34,311 --> 01:27:36,500
kind of lay out the argument for this,
you know,

1465
01:27:36,501 --> 01:27:40,520
the virtual reality simulation hypothesis.
Yeah. And he was basically saying,

1466
01:27:40,521 --> 01:27:43,680
you know, one possibility is in
we, we're in a virtual reality, uh,

1467
01:27:43,830 --> 01:27:45,560
an ancestral simulation.

1468
01:27:45,980 --> 01:27:50,390
And then the other possibility is that
no technology note know civilizations get

1469
01:27:50,391 --> 01:27:54,410
to the point technologically where they
can produce this kind of technology.

1470
01:27:54,411 --> 01:27:57,670
They all vanish. That's
one possibility. Um,

1471
01:27:57,690 --> 01:28:01,370
and then the third possibility was,
I'll see if I can remember it.

1472
01:28:01,670 --> 01:28:03,680
I don't understand that possibility.
So,

1473
01:28:03,681 --> 01:28:05,930
so basically saying
this is a real universe,

1474
01:28:05,931 --> 01:28:10,490
because know civilizations get so,
so there could be no civilization,

1475
01:28:10,491 --> 01:28:12,920
which gets to the point where
it develops that capacity,

1476
01:28:12,921 --> 01:28:14,570
that virtual reality technology.

1477
01:28:14,870 --> 01:28:16,550
But what,
how was that even an option?

1478
01:28:16,551 --> 01:28:21,200
No civilization does it make he
could say no civilization has,

1479
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:25,080
oh yeah, no civilization has,
you know, so that there are so,

1480
01:28:25,110 --> 01:28:27,540
because he's assuming that if,
if someone does do it,

1481
01:28:27,610 --> 01:28:30,320
this is getting kind of
analytically geeky. But, um,

1482
01:28:30,410 --> 01:28:33,690
so it was this whole damn show,
right? Yeah, that's true. But he,

1483
01:28:33,691 --> 01:28:35,400
I think he's saying like, if, if, if,

1484
01:28:35,430 --> 01:28:40,040
if a hyper intelligent species can create
a virtual reality, they will, you know,

1485
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:43,980
and they'll create many of them. Right.
And so it's Probabil probability wise,

1486
01:28:44,010 --> 01:28:47,490
it's much more likely that we're in a
simulation because of how many that could

1487
01:28:47,491 --> 01:28:48,181
be created.
You know,

1488
01:28:48,181 --> 01:28:51,550
you get some light emit an infinite
number of universes through a,

1489
01:28:51,551 --> 01:28:54,210
like a hyper in a next
generation computer.

1490
01:28:54,330 --> 01:28:57,360
So that was his argument for why
we're probably in a simulation.

1491
01:28:57,810 --> 01:29:02,010
Never say probably, uh, I, I would
agree in the sense that it's,

1492
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:07,080
it's quite possible that if it is
possible to one day achieve this sort of

1493
01:29:07,470 --> 01:29:11,460
technological ability to create something
that's indistinguishable from this

1494
01:29:11,461 --> 01:29:13,440
reality.
If it is possible,

1495
01:29:13,441 --> 01:29:16,800
and I assume that it's
going to be possible if you
hear about things like this

1496
01:29:16,801 --> 01:29:19,320
new oculus rift and
compare it to the quill,

1497
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:22,530
they used to have to dip into
ink to write things down.

1498
01:29:22,531 --> 01:29:25,230
That was the only way to
distribute information. Yeah,

1499
01:29:25,231 --> 01:29:27,540
it's possible that one day
we're going to achieve that.

1500
01:29:27,570 --> 01:29:32,040
But the other thing that you have to
take into consideration is it's almost

1501
01:29:32,041 --> 01:29:37,041
universally accepted that at least if
this world is real and if this life that

1502
01:29:37,591 --> 01:29:39,330
we are living is not a simulation,

1503
01:29:39,630 --> 01:29:44,040
it's universally accepted that this
is the pinnacle of human innovation.

1504
01:29:44,370 --> 01:29:48,510
That we are at the cusp where at the apex
right now and that we are at the very,

1505
01:29:48,511 --> 01:29:51,600
like there's more information today.

1506
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:53,610
We have more knowledge.

1507
01:29:53,730 --> 01:29:58,200
We have more of an understanding of our
universe than any human beings before us

1508
01:29:58,260 --> 01:30:00,930
ever have ever.
So if that's the case,

1509
01:30:01,290 --> 01:30:03,510
why wouldn't we assume that we
just haven't reached it yet?

1510
01:30:03,540 --> 01:30:08,540
That seems to be far more likely than
the possibility that no civilization ever

1511
01:30:09,091 --> 01:30:11,820
achieves it.
That's why it's not there yet.

1512
01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:15,510
Well then we just haven't reached it
yet. Yeah, it seems way more likely.

1513
01:30:15,511 --> 01:30:17,480
I don't understand why
anybody would reach, uh,

1514
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:20,430
a contrary conclusion if all the evidence,

1515
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:25,640
whether it's cultural like watching old
television shows and comparing them to

1516
01:30:25,711 --> 01:30:30,570
the sophistication of today's, whether
it's musical comparing old, uh, you know,

1517
01:30:30,571 --> 01:30:35,550
old like Beethoven music
and old music from the 50s,

1518
01:30:35,551 --> 01:30:38,760
like buddy Holly type shit. And comparing
it to what people are doing today,

1519
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:43,490
whether it's technological,
which is super easy and clear to,

1520
01:30:43,550 --> 01:30:46,650
to grasp and understand.
It's no,

1521
01:30:46,740 --> 01:30:51,090
there's no doubt whatsoever that were
at the apex that as far as what we can

1522
01:30:51,091 --> 01:30:54,810
observe, that things are,
we have more ability,

1523
01:30:54,811 --> 01:30:59,760
were more competent, we're more, we're
more able to alter our environment,

1524
01:30:59,790 --> 01:31:01,350
communicate,
et cetera.

1525
01:31:01,610 --> 01:31:06,610
Our technology is far more
far more complex than ever
has been at any other time

1526
01:31:07,261 --> 01:31:09,990
in human history that's been recorded
that we're, that we can access.

1527
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:13,770
So if that's the case, why won't we just
assume that we're on this path to that?

1528
01:31:13,950 --> 01:31:17,820
Why would we assume that no civilization
has ever achieved it or can ever

1529
01:31:17,821 --> 01:31:19,170
achieve it?
That doesn't mean,

1530
01:31:19,510 --> 01:31:22,960
I don't assume that myself,
but I think I won.

1531
01:31:23,030 --> 01:31:24,990
One thing I'd throw in the ring is,
you know,

1532
01:31:25,140 --> 01:31:29,160
that way of looking at our history is
sort of like a linear model, right?

1533
01:31:29,161 --> 01:31:32,130
Like right. We've kind of, we've
got the story about, you know,

1534
01:31:32,220 --> 01:31:35,580
the universe started this many billion
years ago with the Big Bang and then it

1535
01:31:35,581 --> 01:31:39,250
sort of coalesced into whatever it
coalesced into. And eventually, you know,

1536
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:43,230
life emerged a billion years ago
and evolve to be what it is now.

1537
01:31:43,530 --> 01:31:48,330
And we're at this sort of where at the
sort of linear progression of Ellucian

1538
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:52,230
unfolding,
but that story's only like 200 years old.

1539
01:31:52,740 --> 01:31:56,640
So why would we assume that that
story is accurate? Um, or that,

1540
01:31:56,641 --> 01:31:58,260
that way of looking at it's accurate?
I mean,

1541
01:31:58,261 --> 01:32:00,800
it seems more likely in a hundred
years we'll have a completely,

1542
01:32:00,940 --> 01:32:03,790
completely different conception
of what the universe is. And,

1543
01:32:03,970 --> 01:32:07,540
and I wonder if part of that conception
of, part of what we'll break down,

1544
01:32:08,140 --> 01:32:10,990
and I'll tie this back into the
contemplative tradition because this is,

1545
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:13,540
it's something that breaks
down in contemplative practice,

1546
01:32:13,780 --> 01:32:16,850
is the sense that time is,
uh,

1547
01:32:16,990 --> 01:32:21,890
exists in the way we think it exists. It
exists in a linear kind of motion, um,

1548
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:26,540
time, you know, for the, for the
zen in the Zen tradition with Dogan,

1549
01:32:26,550 --> 01:32:29,910
his whole a chronic, like the
holographic universe, you know, there's,

1550
01:32:29,950 --> 01:32:33,760
all these things are contained within
themselves in this sort of a lot of these

1551
01:32:33,761 --> 01:32:36,430
Buddhist descriptions of
consciousness, you know, all,

1552
01:32:36,431 --> 01:32:40,840
all times exist simultaneously and
can be accessed simultaneously.

1553
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:45,070
You know, it can be accessed
here or there. And so in that
sense, you know, the, uh,

1554
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:48,670
as the, as the traditional
tech say, the Buddhas of past,

1555
01:32:48,671 --> 01:32:52,510
present and future all exist right now,
including ourselves.

1556
01:32:52,990 --> 01:32:56,350
And I don't know, that would be a very
different way of experiencing time.

1557
01:32:56,351 --> 01:32:59,560
I experienced it, you know, maybe like
on occasions experience it that way.

1558
01:32:59,561 --> 01:33:01,450
But for the most part,
that is not the way I,

1559
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:04,570
I tend to think this is a
linear thing that's like,

1560
01:33:04,660 --> 01:33:06,010
this got to start and we'll have an end.

1561
01:33:06,330 --> 01:33:10,290
Well, the number one mind fuck
of all times infinity and being,

1562
01:33:11,310 --> 01:33:13,740
being that not only is it like,

1563
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:16,780
I think especially when your children,
you know,

1564
01:33:16,781 --> 01:33:21,000
like you know the kids will say something
like, you know I, when times infinity,

1565
01:33:21,270 --> 01:33:24,380
you know what, what
infinity the, the, the,

1566
01:33:24,550 --> 01:33:29,550
the big mind fuck of infinity is that
not only is the concept of infinity

1567
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:31,830
impossible to grasp,

1568
01:33:31,890 --> 01:33:36,890
but the parameters of that concept are
so strange that if infinity is real and

1569
01:33:38,071 --> 01:33:39,330
if the universe is infinite,

1570
01:33:40,200 --> 01:33:44,820
the way it's been described to me is
that everything that has ever happened on

1571
01:33:44,821 --> 01:33:45,654
this earth,

1572
01:33:45,780 --> 01:33:50,700
in the exact order has
happened on other earths,

1573
01:33:50,940 --> 01:33:54,900
an infinite number of times,
including every single timeline.

1574
01:33:55,230 --> 01:34:00,230
So right now the 1950s or going on an
infinite number of times in the exact same

1575
01:34:01,081 --> 01:34:05,610
order, the 1950s went on in
America, the 1950s on earth,

1576
01:34:05,850 --> 01:34:10,500
the 1950s are going on in the infinite
number of times in the universe as are

1577
01:34:10,590 --> 01:34:15,590
the 1960s as our 1961 December 21st as
our December 22nd all those days are

1578
01:34:16,891 --> 01:34:20,280
happening in the exact same
order with the exact same events,

1579
01:34:20,281 --> 01:34:25,281
exact same wards and every
possible variation in between.

1580
01:34:25,670 --> 01:34:28,890
So different words,
different events,

1581
01:34:29,010 --> 01:34:32,940
different forms of expression.
Different languages arise,

1582
01:34:32,970 --> 01:34:37,970
different conquers when those things are
all happening simultaneously throughout

1583
01:34:38,731 --> 01:34:43,050
the universe.
So everything is happening all at once.

1584
01:34:43,290 --> 01:34:45,450
So if infinity is correct,

1585
01:34:45,750 --> 01:34:50,700
like what their concept of time being
constant and happening all at once,

1586
01:34:51,060 --> 01:34:52,260
it is,
it's,

1587
01:34:52,290 --> 01:34:57,290
it is happening all at once is just the
container that holds it in his infinite.

1588
01:34:58,460 --> 01:34:59,030
It's,

1589
01:34:59,030 --> 01:35:04,030
it is a physical manifestation of this
concept and an okay question to riff off

1590
01:35:05,091 --> 01:35:06,110
that that I'd ask is,

1591
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:11,150
and is consciousness something that's
happening to this biological being in this

1592
01:35:11,151 --> 01:35:16,151
one variation of the universe or is
consciousness something that moves through

1593
01:35:16,611 --> 01:35:21,050
this infinite potentiality and
experiences it? That's the mind fuck.

1594
01:35:21,051 --> 01:35:26,051
If you wake up and you're in this other
you somewhere else in the multiverse and

1595
01:35:28,071 --> 01:35:32,750
you know your decisions and choices
allow you to travel from one potential to

1596
01:35:32,751 --> 01:35:37,230
the next, but wherever you left
off where you've ever made,

1597
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:40,310
maybe you were a smoker
or a drinker in the past,

1598
01:35:40,311 --> 01:35:44,540
or you had some sort of bad habits
and you escape those bad habits,

1599
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:48,320
but not every timeline and then
at some timeline, this timeline,

1600
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:53,660
well, maybe not yet. You
will after this conversation.

1601
01:35:54,170 --> 01:35:56,820
You know what I mean?
I mean like the idea of being that we're,

1602
01:35:56,900 --> 01:35:59,870
we believe that we're limited to this,

1603
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:04,960
this very same physical
space in the universe because
this is where we are every

1604
01:36:05,481 --> 01:36:06,290
day.

1605
01:36:06,290 --> 01:36:11,290
But what if we transfer our consciousness
from this one to the next one and

1606
01:36:11,361 --> 01:36:15,980
they're indistinguishable from
each other physically to us,

1607
01:36:16,580 --> 01:36:20,300
but not their potential is very different.

1608
01:36:20,660 --> 01:36:24,080
And that in a sense,
you are dimension traveling.

1609
01:36:25,490 --> 01:36:30,020
And that's why we sleep.
That's why people say sleep on it,

1610
01:36:31,850 --> 01:36:33,380
sleep on your problems,
man.

1611
01:36:33,590 --> 01:36:36,380
Then maybe it'll go away in the morning
and you're just going to transfer to

1612
01:36:36,381 --> 01:36:40,640
another stage of you somewhere
else in the universe.

1613
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:44,210
Or maybe this is more hippy bullshit.

1614
01:36:46,650 --> 01:36:50,990
Heinous. Hate it. When I accused
myself, rightly so of hippy bullshit.

1615
01:36:51,410 --> 01:36:54,560
But if,
if an infinity is correct and um,

1616
01:36:54,710 --> 01:36:56,810
not only do they believe that
the universe is infinite,

1617
01:36:56,811 --> 01:36:59,000
but they believe there are
infinite number of universes,

1618
01:36:59,001 --> 01:37:03,110
which is the ultimate ultimate mind fuck.
The fractal nature of reality itself.

1619
01:37:03,111 --> 01:37:07,700
Being that every single galaxy, which
contains hundreds of billions of stars,

1620
01:37:07,701 --> 01:37:10,640
has a supermassive black
hole in the center of it,

1621
01:37:10,670 --> 01:37:14,780
which is exactly one half of 1%
of the mass of the entire galaxy.

1622
01:37:14,781 --> 01:37:16,070
And if you pass through that,

1623
01:37:16,310 --> 01:37:20,810
you will enter into another universe
of hundreds of billions of galaxies,

1624
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:25,400
each with a black hole and the center
that has a portal to another universe.

1625
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:28,880
And then the whole thing just keeps
going on. So they're all the whole,

1626
01:37:28,881 --> 01:37:30,290
every universe is infinite.

1627
01:37:30,291 --> 01:37:33,560
And inside every universe is an
infinite number of universes.

1628
01:37:33,860 --> 01:37:35,690
And that's how big it is.

1629
01:37:35,990 --> 01:37:39,590
That's why every timeline
that has ever existed,

1630
01:37:39,680 --> 01:37:42,830
every possibility is all
happening simultaneously,

1631
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:47,770
all throughout the whole thing. That's
what those Tibetans thought. Well,

1632
01:37:47,790 --> 01:37:51,740
they sat in a cave and just explored
their own minds. They were tripping balls.

1633
01:37:51,890 --> 01:37:52,970
They're probably taking something

1634
01:37:55,260 --> 01:37:59,160
they weren't centration were tripping
on in Dutch in history. Yeah.

1635
01:37:59,220 --> 01:38:01,790
That's the thing. The indogenous
drugs, like you're tripping.

1636
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:04,980
Even if you're not tripping like
you, you have to, everybody does.

1637
01:38:04,981 --> 01:38:07,200
There's no way around it.
You're tripping when you're sleeping.

1638
01:38:07,650 --> 01:38:11,670
I had some trippy dreams
last night. Totally. Yeah.
Those are trips. Absolutely.

1639
01:38:12,100 --> 01:38:15,900
That was the trip. This is a trip.
Yes, definitely tripping right now.

1640
01:38:16,050 --> 01:38:20,490
I think a lot of people listen to their
trip until this people right now on a

1641
01:38:20,491 --> 01:38:24,570
subway going, whoa, whoa, that everything
is happening everywhere. All the time.

1642
01:38:25,350 --> 01:38:28,050
Like the concept of infinity,
like no, no, no. This is the,

1643
01:38:28,051 --> 01:38:31,470
this is a unique moment that's
unique. Not, not, not really.

1644
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:36,810
Got The concept of infinity then
everything's happening right now. Yes.

1645
01:38:36,850 --> 01:38:39,870
Well for you,
everything is happening right now,

1646
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:43,530
but the concept of infinity
is undeniable mathematically.

1647
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:47,100
That's the problem is that
like you can't just ignore the,

1648
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:49,020
like all you have to do
is go outside and look up.

1649
01:38:50,180 --> 01:38:54,540
You go outside and look up at night and
you see stars realize those are just an

1650
01:38:54,660 --> 01:38:58,170
impossible distance and
those are the neighbors.

1651
01:38:58,380 --> 01:39:02,250
Those are the ones that are really close
and if you stood on one of those stars

1652
01:39:02,251 --> 01:39:03,420
and looked out into the distance,

1653
01:39:03,421 --> 01:39:08,421
he would see stars that were equally
far away that seem equally ridiculous to

1654
01:39:08,851 --> 01:39:11,130
try to reach. And if you got
to those, there's no end.

1655
01:39:11,160 --> 01:39:12,800
You just see you're going to
keep going and going and going.

1656
01:39:12,801 --> 01:39:14,400
So all the evidence of infinity,

1657
01:39:14,760 --> 01:39:18,390
at least of the concept of great,

1658
01:39:18,780 --> 01:39:23,780
great distance being outside of the realm
of understanding is all it's right in

1659
01:39:24,121 --> 01:39:25,530
front of us every night

1660
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:29,530
and a moment. Yeah. At
the, at the same time,

1661
01:39:29,531 --> 01:39:33,370
I think there's a way of experiencing
infinity that isn't about distance.

1662
01:39:33,940 --> 01:39:37,490
It's about consciousness and
infinity being, you know,

1663
01:39:37,630 --> 01:39:40,840
this conscious experience that
we're having right now, right.

1664
01:39:40,870 --> 01:39:43,660
The room that we're seeing,
the sounds that we're hearing,

1665
01:39:43,990 --> 01:39:45,820
the body sensations that we're having,

1666
01:39:46,150 --> 01:39:50,950
all of these are also arising in our
experience, right in our awareness.

1667
01:39:51,490 --> 01:39:56,440
And the idea of infinite distance is
a thought that arises in my awareness.

1668
01:39:56,680 --> 01:39:59,260
And so in some sense
there's only this awareness,

1669
01:39:59,261 --> 01:40:03,690
there's only this experience that we've
ever had. And so in that sense, you know,

1670
01:40:03,970 --> 01:40:08,560
um, the idea, the concept
of infinity as a distance,

1671
01:40:08,561 --> 01:40:12,130
as a great distance drops away.

1672
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:16,510
And there's just this, there's just
this one moment that's happening.

1673
01:40:16,660 --> 01:40:20,950
I think that's what you pointing to and
there's an infinite quality to it in

1674
01:40:20,951 --> 01:40:24,250
terms of
that,

1675
01:40:24,870 --> 01:40:29,230
that the consciousness
itself is infinitely present.

1676
01:40:29,380 --> 01:40:32,260
It's infinitely here.
I don't know how to describe it actually,

1677
01:40:32,261 --> 01:40:36,250
that the consciousness is infinitely
present throughout the whole thing.

1678
01:40:37,470 --> 01:40:41,530
It it's undeniably the fact
that we are conscious, you know,

1679
01:40:41,531 --> 01:40:45,730
just like you said that the infinity is
undeniable. Consciousness is undeniable.

1680
01:40:46,030 --> 01:40:47,110
You know this is happening.

1681
01:40:47,140 --> 01:40:50,440
You cannot deny this as how, because
there's levels of consciousness, right?

1682
01:40:50,650 --> 01:40:52,960
There's people that are
conscious that are just, they're,

1683
01:40:53,470 --> 01:40:57,580
there's wandering through this live
drinking and walking into walls like are

1684
01:40:57,610 --> 01:41:01,630
they conscious as well and isn't that
consciousness like a very limited

1685
01:41:01,631 --> 01:41:06,010
consciousness and as
consciousness expands, what's the,

1686
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:11,040
with the ongoing theme when we're
talking about meditation and Meditative

1687
01:41:11,171 --> 01:41:13,900
practices in the lightened meant,
yeah,

1688
01:41:13,990 --> 01:41:18,160
achieving the psychedelic states
through consciousness adjustment or

1689
01:41:18,180 --> 01:41:20,140
consciousness manipulation.

1690
01:41:20,650 --> 01:41:23,710
Like there's levels and layers
to the whole thing, right?

1691
01:41:24,730 --> 01:41:25,563
Yeah.
There,

1692
01:41:25,780 --> 01:41:30,780
there are levels and layers and there
is this unified field of consciousness

1693
01:41:32,440 --> 01:41:37,390
which does mount no matter what is arising
in it and how simple or complex it is.

1694
01:41:37,780 --> 01:41:39,100
It's just what it is.

1695
01:41:39,650 --> 01:41:44,650
That's why it's really strange to me
that the concept of simple biology as

1696
01:41:45,281 --> 01:41:49,320
opposed like complex biological
life that understand itself. Yeah.

1697
01:41:49,380 --> 01:41:52,280
It's simple biology of
individual cells or ma,

1698
01:41:52,780 --> 01:41:57,780
then multicell organisms and then the
concept of of being that's aware of itself

1699
01:41:58,630 --> 01:42:03,630
and can communicate over vast distances
like human beings extrapolate that a

1700
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:07,600
thousand years plus
whatever it is from now.

1701
01:42:08,380 --> 01:42:13,380
Do we have the ability to do the same
thing with consciousness throughout the

1702
01:42:13,901 --> 01:42:15,670
entire universe itself?

1703
01:42:15,970 --> 01:42:20,970
Like is our ability to communicate over
vast distances and to communicate with

1704
01:42:21,221 --> 01:42:22,054
each other?

1705
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:27,360
Is this just a beginning stage and
is never ending process of dissolving

1706
01:42:27,911 --> 01:42:31,090
boundaries where the actual
boundaries of space itself? Yeah,

1707
01:42:31,120 --> 01:42:36,070
no longer exist and we can interface with
intelligent life that has figured out

1708
01:42:36,071 --> 01:42:39,100
the same sort of shit. Yeah.
Everywhere else in the world.

1709
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:43,180
The the the like universe wide web or
something. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah.

1710
01:42:43,480 --> 01:42:44,040
I mean if,

1711
01:42:44,040 --> 01:42:48,790
if the universe is infinite and the most
scientists agree it is or they believe

1712
01:42:48,791 --> 01:42:50,630
it is many do.
I mean it's,

1713
01:42:50,950 --> 01:42:53,590
it's one of those things where you
have the observable universe, right?

1714
01:42:53,591 --> 01:42:57,310
Which is like 14 billion light
years or something like that. But,

1715
01:42:57,311 --> 01:42:59,860
and then like we were talking
about with the big bang,

1716
01:42:59,861 --> 01:43:02,710
like it all came out of what
like Mckenna had the, the,

1717
01:43:02,711 --> 01:43:06,850
the best take on the big bang. He's
like, science is essentially saying,

1718
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:10,000
allow us this one miracle
and we'll explain everything.

1719
01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:13,120
And that's really what it is.
They,

1720
01:43:13,121 --> 01:43:17,590
the whole universe came from something
smaller than the head of a pin. How,

1721
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:21,940
um, let me get back to
you on that. But it did.

1722
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:25,930
And because of that, all this stuff's
here. Well, is that a miracle?

1723
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:31,290
Uh, I wouldn't know. Use that
word. You know, like, yes.

1724
01:43:31,480 --> 01:43:34,090
Yes it is. That's a fucking miracle, man.

1725
01:43:34,091 --> 01:43:37,000
If a guy can come back from the dead
after three days, that ain't shit.

1726
01:43:37,390 --> 01:43:39,220
The universe came out of a head of a pin.

1727
01:43:39,221 --> 01:43:41,890
You don't think that's more impressive
than a dude coming back from the dead.

1728
01:43:42,370 --> 01:43:45,280
The guy coming back from dead. Clearly
a miracle. Can we agree on that?

1729
01:43:45,370 --> 01:43:49,180
Walking on water, clearly a
miracle, right? Water into wine.

1730
01:43:49,181 --> 01:43:53,660
The motherfucker made a miracle. Right?
The universe itself is a miracle.

1731
01:43:54,110 --> 01:43:56,580
All of our stories about it or miracles.
Yes.

1732
01:43:57,020 --> 01:44:01,940
And whether or not those are just fables.
The same way the ancient Hawaiians,

1733
01:44:01,941 --> 01:44:06,560
the Polynesians talked about the gods
stitching the stars together with thread.

1734
01:44:06,860 --> 01:44:10,700
You know, maybe that's what
our concept of the big bang,

1735
01:44:10,701 --> 01:44:15,701
it's just our antiquated notion or are
rather primitive notion of something

1736
01:44:16,611 --> 01:44:21,290
that's really beyond our capacity
to understand. Yeah. That's the,

1737
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:25,310
that's what the mind fuck to me. Yeah.
It's our myth. It's our, our isis.

1738
01:44:25,340 --> 01:44:30,230
That's our Zeus. That's our, you know,
that's our Odin is like the big bang.

1739
01:44:30,470 --> 01:44:33,140
Yeah.
It's just in one day they'll laugh at us.

1740
01:44:33,320 --> 01:44:37,310
These fucking dummies thought that the
universe was smaller than the head of a

1741
01:44:37,311 --> 01:44:40,430
pin and that what if for whatever reason,
man,

1742
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:45,620
it just blew up and became the
universe. Yeah. One day soon probably.

1743
01:44:46,100 --> 01:44:48,130
Yeah, maybe. Right. Maybe,

1744
01:44:48,170 --> 01:44:52,880
or at least in terms of reference,
it'll,

1745
01:44:52,881 --> 01:44:56,840
it'll be similar to Galileo
to us. Yeah, yeah. You know,

1746
01:44:56,870 --> 01:45:01,850
Galileo thinking that the universe
was not centered around the earth and

1747
01:45:01,851 --> 01:45:05,500
everybody going, what are you
fucking crazy. Absolutely.

1748
01:45:05,510 --> 01:45:10,510
Like a big form point of contention and
now it's universally agreed that Galileo

1749
01:45:12,441 --> 01:45:14,930
was correct and everybody
else's being silly.

1750
01:45:15,200 --> 01:45:18,620
I there may very well come a day when
someone proposes something far more

1751
01:45:18,621 --> 01:45:21,970
radical than the big bang, the proves
to be true. And everybody, you know,

1752
01:45:21,971 --> 01:45:25,460
everybody else is like, wait, wait, what
are you saying? Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1753
01:45:26,030 --> 01:45:30,020
I'll give you ever seen that.
Um, there's an a, an audio of a,

1754
01:45:30,410 --> 01:45:34,670
I think his name is, uh, Gates and um,

1755
01:45:34,760 --> 01:45:38,960
William Gates, the guy who had the,
uh, the concept of a, a similar,

1756
01:45:39,230 --> 01:45:43,790
he has a simulation theory that he
presented to Neil degrasse Tyson.

1757
01:45:43,820 --> 01:45:46,790
Yeah. Yeah. That was the
president's scientific advisor.

1758
01:45:46,791 --> 01:45:51,440
Obama's adviser for awhile. Was He
really William Gates? Yeah. No kidding.

1759
01:45:51,800 --> 01:45:56,130
Um, if it's the same guys, the same guy
that found the computer codes in straight,

1760
01:45:56,240 --> 01:46:00,050
sort of like a Samuel L. Jackson look
alike. Yes. That's him. That's him.

1761
01:46:00,500 --> 01:46:04,670
And that the conversation that he has
with Neil degrasse Tyson where he says

1762
01:46:04,671 --> 01:46:09,671
that they found self correcting computer
code at the in the heart of string

1763
01:46:09,861 --> 01:46:14,510
theory. Yeah. And, and then
Neil degrasse Tyson goes, wait,
wait, wait. Okay. Okay. Okay.

1764
01:46:14,930 --> 01:46:17,690
Um, I want to hear the again
like say this one more time.

1765
01:46:17,691 --> 01:46:21,630
You found self correcting co I'm,
I'm,

1766
01:46:21,631 --> 01:46:23,270
I'm not sure if I understand
what you're saying.

1767
01:46:23,570 --> 01:46:25,670
Pull the video because that's it's uh,

1768
01:46:25,700 --> 01:46:29,330
we watched this for the first time last
night. Oh really? Yeah. Oh, this is,

1769
01:46:29,420 --> 01:46:31,160
this is one of my favorites.
I got taken down.

1770
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:34,760
I gotta find out that link got taken
down. It was on reddit. Goddamn commies.

1771
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:37,640
Who's doing that take?
Why would you take doctor?

1772
01:46:37,850 --> 01:46:41,050
Just self correcting
Computer Code Correcting

1773
01:46:43,010 --> 01:46:44,990
Cute Code Strength Area

1774
01:46:47,470 --> 01:46:51,350
Gates. Let's see. Yeah, that's it.

1775
01:46:51,370 --> 01:46:55,200
Strange computer code to south discovered
concealed. If you just go to the,

1776
01:46:55,201 --> 01:46:59,880
I found it. Just do what I just
did. I found it again. Okay.

1777
01:47:00,390 --> 01:47:05,190
Strange. Computer code discovered
concealed in super string equations.

1778
01:47:05,420 --> 01:47:06,630
This is a little bit of nonsense.

1779
01:47:06,660 --> 01:47:10,710
The beginning for the first 30 seconds
is like weird [inaudible] here. Play it

1780
01:47:11,120 --> 01:47:12,940
just that are behind your head right now.

1781
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:17,620
These are pictures of equations
I've been for the last 15 years.

1782
01:47:17,621 --> 01:47:21,020
Trying to answer the kinds of
questions that my colleagues here,

1783
01:47:21,021 --> 01:47:21,940
if it happened reasoning.

1784
01:47:22,390 --> 01:47:25,690
And what I've come to understand is
that there are these incredible pictures

1785
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:29,580
that contain all the information of a
set of equations that are related to the

1786
01:47:29,581 --> 01:47:30,414
string theory.

1787
01:47:30,790 --> 01:47:34,180
And it's even more bizarre than that
because when you then try to understand

1788
01:47:34,181 --> 01:47:38,200
these pictures, you find out that
buried in them, our computer codes,

1789
01:47:38,470 --> 01:47:42,850
just like the type that you find in
the browser when you go surf the web.

1790
01:47:43,250 --> 01:47:46,780
And so I'm left with a puzzle of trying
to figure out whether I live in the

1791
01:47:46,781 --> 01:47:47,614
matrix or not.

1792
01:47:49,790 --> 01:47:51,890
You're blowing my mind at this moment.
So you're saying,

1793
01:47:52,580 --> 01:47:56,690
are you saying if your attempt to
understand the fundamental operations of

1794
01:47:56,691 --> 01:48:01,691
nature leads you to a set of equations
that are indistinguishable from the

1795
01:48:01,731 --> 01:48:06,530
equations that drive search engines
and browsers on our computers?

1796
01:48:06,590 --> 01:48:09,650
That is correct.
So I'm still,

1797
01:48:10,580 --> 01:48:12,350
I have to just be silent
for a minute here.

1798
01:48:14,120 --> 01:48:16,340
So you're saying as you dig deeper,

1799
01:48:17,930 --> 01:48:19,250
you find

1800
01:48:20,780 --> 01:48:25,780
computer code written in
the fabric of the cosmos

1801
01:48:26,440 --> 01:48:30,460
into the equations that we want to
use to describe the cosmos. Yes.

1802
01:48:30,970 --> 01:48:35,110
Computer Code, Computer Code,
strings of bits of ones and Zeros.

1803
01:48:35,420 --> 01:48:38,630
It's not just sort of
resembles computer code.

1804
01:48:39,020 --> 01:48:40,610
You're saying it is computer code.

1805
01:48:40,640 --> 01:48:42,890
It's not even just his computer code.

1806
01:48:42,891 --> 01:48:46,880
It's a special kind of computer code
that was invented by a scientist named

1807
01:48:46,881 --> 01:48:50,090
Claude Shannon and the 1940s
that's what we find very,

1808
01:48:50,091 --> 01:48:55,091
very deeply inside the equations that
occur in string theory and in general in

1809
01:48:55,581 --> 01:48:58,190
systems that we get caught
say are supersymmetric

1810
01:49:04,620 --> 01:49:06,900
time to go home.
I think where are we going to go?

1811
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:09,570
So are you saying we are all just,

1812
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:14,600
there's some entity that programmed the
universe and we're just expressions of

1813
01:49:16,111 --> 01:49:17,250
their code?

1814
01:49:17,870 --> 01:49:19,090
Well I didn't say that

1815
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:22,850
like the Matrix.
Do you think about what you said those

1816
01:49:22,850 --> 01:49:26,960
codes are showing on the screen and
behind you right now they don't look like

1817
01:49:26,961 --> 01:49:27,441
codes,

1818
01:49:27,441 --> 01:49:32,441
but these pictures which we call a dink
groves or graphical representations of

1819
01:49:32,691 --> 01:49:37,220
sets of equations that are based on codes.
So this is in fact,

1820
01:49:37,221 --> 01:49:38,690
to answer your question more directly,

1821
01:49:39,080 --> 01:49:44,080
I have in my life come to a very strange
place because I never expected that the

1822
01:49:45,051 --> 01:49:49,780
movie, the Matrix might be an
accurate of the place in which I live.

1823
01:49:50,980 --> 01:49:53,650
Well, Dan give you an argument
that we don't live in the matrix

1824
01:49:55,170 --> 01:49:59,390
please to quick very simple argument.

1825
01:50:00,130 --> 01:50:03,100
There's a property that the
real world right down here,

1826
01:50:03,210 --> 01:50:06,570
cause that no mathematical
equation hasn't,

1827
01:50:06,571 --> 01:50:09,000
no solution of the
equation has it? No. Okay.

1828
01:50:09,030 --> 01:50:13,500
That no abstract object has here in the
real world. It is always some moment,

1829
01:50:13,501 --> 01:50:18,180
which is one of a series of passing
moments in a mathematical equation doesn't

1830
01:50:18,181 --> 01:50:21,600
have a flow of time in it.
It just is.

1831
01:50:22,030 --> 01:50:23,780
And this means but Lee,

1832
01:50:24,890 --> 01:50:29,890
but I need him here and now
this means that to me that the,

1833
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:32,950
the,
the,

1834
01:50:32,951 --> 01:50:37,830
the ancient metaphysical fantasy
that we quote are just mathematics.

1835
01:50:38,320 --> 01:50:42,360
Okay? CanNot be true because in a
world that was just mathematics,

1836
01:50:42,660 --> 01:50:47,190
there would be no moment of
time as a function of time.

1837
01:50:48,030 --> 01:50:51,510
It's a differential equations.
But then you lay the solution out.

1838
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:57,300
Taking, you keep using the word is, and
I'm talking about the word describe.

1839
01:50:57,710 --> 01:50:58,000
Okay.

1840
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:01,330
You see the whole drive is
fine, but let me, let me finish

1841
01:51:01,410 --> 01:51:06,180
please. Since we started with
my discussion point is that I,

1842
01:51:06,700 --> 01:51:07,141
I,
you know,

1843
01:51:07,141 --> 01:51:12,141
it's fun to talk about some
deep metaphysical essence
that sits behind physics

1844
01:51:12,780 --> 01:51:14,490
before some of us,

1845
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:18,360
it's about trying to find the most
accurate way to describe where we live.

1846
01:51:18,390 --> 01:51:23,390
And so my statement is that in
the description of our universe,

1847
01:51:24,570 --> 01:51:28,170
that is a super symmetrical universe
which we were going to test in the LHC.

1848
01:51:28,620 --> 01:51:32,880
If you believe that description, I can
show you the presence of these codes.

1849
01:51:33,030 --> 01:51:33,863
That's my statement.

1850
01:51:35,950 --> 01:51:38,070
I'm fucked.
I can't,

1851
01:51:38,780 --> 01:51:43,290
can't go on shows over.
What do you say to that?

1852
01:51:44,060 --> 01:51:49,050
Like you, you listen to what these guys
have just described and talked about.

1853
01:51:49,290 --> 01:51:53,220
I disagree with the one guy saying that
because we live in this moment in this,

1854
01:51:53,221 --> 01:51:57,090
there's like this linear pattern to
things that it can't be a mathematical

1855
01:51:57,390 --> 01:52:01,830
equation. That's not true. That doesn't
make any sense. That's like saying, um,

1856
01:52:02,160 --> 01:52:07,160
if there is a car and the car is driving
on a road that has been created by

1857
01:52:07,261 --> 01:52:11,970
people, if it's, you know, if it's going
from one distance, if it's traveling,

1858
01:52:12,510 --> 01:52:17,510
that it can't possibly be an artificially
created an environment that doesn't

1859
01:52:17,731 --> 01:52:18,630
make any sense to me.

1860
01:52:19,020 --> 01:52:23,280
It's like you're traveling through this
thing just because you're experiencing

1861
01:52:23,281 --> 01:52:26,250
the now and it's progressive and you
know the past and you were looking to

1862
01:52:26,251 --> 01:52:28,890
forward to the future and you're
moving and you're in this mode.

1863
01:52:29,040 --> 01:52:31,610
That doesn't mean it's not
a mathematic representation.

1864
01:52:33,810 --> 01:52:33,901
Well,

1865
01:52:33,901 --> 01:52:37,680
what comes to mind is that a lot of
times in our formulas are our mathematic

1866
01:52:37,681 --> 01:52:39,420
equations that I'm not a mathematician.

1867
01:52:39,870 --> 01:52:43,950
It's the mind tendency is to
lock down on the variables,

1868
01:52:44,520 --> 01:52:48,620
but then it locks it down.
So it's constantly changing.

1869
01:52:50,680 --> 01:52:51,513
What do you mean by that?

1870
01:52:54,990 --> 01:52:57,080
Meaning that we have,

1871
01:52:57,580 --> 01:53:02,580
there is a tendency of mine to like to
go into concepts as if they were solid

1872
01:53:02,760 --> 01:53:06,870
and as if they were fixed and any kind
of time that we do that we locked down

1873
01:53:06,871 --> 01:53:10,950
the possibility. So if we can relax
into whatever it's representing,

1874
01:53:11,220 --> 01:53:15,480
then that representation can continue to
be fluid and so therefore there's a lot

1875
01:53:15,481 --> 01:53:19,620
of space and a lot of room to continue
and the present moment is not just one

1876
01:53:19,621 --> 01:53:20,450
thing.

1877
01:53:20,450 --> 01:53:23,030
I just don't understand
the argument that if,

1878
01:53:24,550 --> 01:53:28,660
if mathematics are, if, if it's,

1879
01:53:29,230 --> 01:53:32,610
I guess he's trying to say in
a sense that because we're,

1880
01:53:32,620 --> 01:53:35,320
we experienced individual moments,
we have this moment,

1881
01:53:35,321 --> 01:53:39,070
we're in this moment and
that it's progressive that
this wouldn't be the case if

1882
01:53:39,071 --> 01:53:43,060
it was a mathematical equation.
That doesn't make any sense to me.

1883
01:53:43,480 --> 01:53:44,530
Maybe I'm just too dumb,

1884
01:53:44,740 --> 01:53:48,130
but it seems to me that that leaves
out the possibilities of yes,

1885
01:53:48,131 --> 01:53:50,320
you could do that or yes you could.

1886
01:53:50,380 --> 01:53:55,090
It could be a mathematical equation
that you are experiencing or it could be

1887
01:53:55,091 --> 01:54:00,091
that this idea of this computer code
that they're finding is just simply a lot

1888
01:54:01,331 --> 01:54:04,510
like so many other codes that
we found and things that, that,

1889
01:54:04,511 --> 01:54:07,390
that indicate that nature has
some sort of a pattern to it.

1890
01:54:07,660 --> 01:54:10,570
Like the FIBONACCI
sequence. Like, you know,

1891
01:54:10,571 --> 01:54:14,920
the idea that these codes
that exist in nature,

1892
01:54:15,170 --> 01:54:19,180
they're there, they don't exist
because this is artificial,

1893
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:23,170
but they exist because nature
essentially runs on mathematics.

1894
01:54:23,830 --> 01:54:28,330
So is nature artificial or is it what?

1895
01:54:28,420 --> 01:54:31,810
I don't think anything has artificial
or you can say everything's artificial.

1896
01:54:31,811 --> 01:54:34,270
Yeah,
well everything is natural.

1897
01:54:34,590 --> 01:54:39,590
There's like everything on earth
including like artificial chemicals were

1898
01:54:40,661 --> 01:54:43,000
produced from things that are
naturally occurring on earth.

1899
01:54:43,570 --> 01:54:48,340
And human beings are a natural creation
of the earth or of biological life

1900
01:54:48,341 --> 01:54:52,870
itself and all the byproducts of
human beings including things that we

1901
01:54:52,871 --> 01:54:55,570
considered to not be natural.
Our natural,

1902
01:54:55,990 --> 01:54:59,810
just like a beehive is a natural
creation of a B. You know,

1903
01:54:59,830 --> 01:55:04,100
nuclear waste is the natural creation
of the inquisitive human being. It's,

1904
01:55:04,150 --> 01:55:07,570
they're not natural, but they are
natural cause everything is natural.

1905
01:55:07,720 --> 01:55:12,130
They don't exist outside of our
manipulation, but we are a part of nature.

1906
01:55:12,330 --> 01:55:15,760
So essentially all of our
creations are in fact natural.

1907
01:55:15,950 --> 01:55:20,400
I make this argument so often to
try to undercut the notion that um,

1908
01:55:20,770 --> 01:55:22,950
using technology to uh,

1909
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:28,280
develop your ability to contemplate
the universe in consciousness,

1910
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:32,230
uh, that, that somehow is unnatural. I
use that all the time but I'm thinking,

1911
01:55:32,530 --> 01:55:35,740
you know, you could, you could say the
same thing. Like everything is artificial.

1912
01:55:35,741 --> 01:55:37,930
Everything is generated from
something else. You know,

1913
01:55:37,931 --> 01:55:40,330
the big bang came from somewhere.

1914
01:55:40,390 --> 01:55:44,430
The mathematical formulas and the
starting conditions came from some non

1915
01:55:45,180 --> 01:55:47,790
physical place outside of this universe.

1916
01:55:48,150 --> 01:55:51,390
And so therefore they're
artificial from this perspective.

1917
01:55:51,690 --> 01:55:54,570
But I think that's the same saying the
same thing as everything is natural,

1918
01:55:55,080 --> 01:55:57,330
everything is artificial
and everything is natural.

1919
01:55:57,930 --> 01:56:02,010
Yeah. Everything is
natural. I think it's the,

1920
01:56:02,380 --> 01:56:06,360
we have this idea of natural
and artificial that we
described with our foods.

1921
01:56:06,810 --> 01:56:07,090
You know,

1922
01:56:07,090 --> 01:56:11,490
we describe it with are the things that
are healthy and non healthy about what

1923
01:56:11,491 --> 01:56:12,960
we've created in our culture.

1924
01:56:13,590 --> 01:56:18,590
But it's when you start using those same
terms to describe human creation and

1925
01:56:19,591 --> 01:56:23,940
then you start understanding the nature
of human innovation and creativity in

1926
01:56:23,941 --> 01:56:27,300
the first place. Like boy, I don't
know if that's natural or not.

1927
01:56:27,510 --> 01:56:32,510
How could it be any less natural than an
octopus changing its shape to hide or,

1928
01:56:34,141 --> 01:56:37,500
you know, changing. It's a skin tone
to blend in with the environment.

1929
01:56:37,501 --> 01:56:38,490
Isn't that natural?

1930
01:56:38,760 --> 01:56:42,390
It's an artificial looked at the octopus
is created in order to camouflage

1931
01:56:42,391 --> 01:56:43,980
itself from predators or prey.

1932
01:56:44,700 --> 01:56:45,090
What do you,

1933
01:56:45,090 --> 01:56:48,690
what do you think people are really
pointing to when they say something's

1934
01:56:48,691 --> 01:56:49,470
unnatural?

1935
01:56:49,470 --> 01:56:52,680
Like what do you think they're really
getting at are really trying to say it's

1936
01:56:52,681 --> 01:56:55,950
bad. It's bad. Yeah. We
gotta go back in time,

1937
01:56:56,580 --> 01:57:00,570
go back to chopping wood and, sure.
Yeah. It's bad according to what?

1938
01:57:00,810 --> 01:57:05,810
Like according to what set of values or
what conception of what the good is good

1939
01:57:06,061 --> 01:57:07,410
in the universe.
Right.

1940
01:57:07,800 --> 01:57:12,420
I think we're constantly instantiating
our utopias through, you know,

1941
01:57:12,421 --> 01:57:16,800
what we, how we live in what we
do. And like we're constantly

1942
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:21,900
deluding ourselves into thinking
our conception of the universes.

1943
01:57:21,950 --> 01:57:26,000
The correct conception.
Hmm. And, and, and, but,

1944
01:57:26,300 --> 01:57:30,890
but I'm like, we can't help it. Like
I cannot help but say, you know,

1945
01:57:30,891 --> 01:57:34,610
I think this is the most important
thing. Compassion, wisdom. You know,

1946
01:57:34,611 --> 01:57:38,410
like I've got my own conception of
what's most important. But is there a

1947
01:57:38,550 --> 01:57:41,880
most important, I mean, is
the word most important?

1948
01:57:41,881 --> 01:57:44,910
The problem where the definition
of most important? The problem.

1949
01:57:46,420 --> 01:57:49,720
Because what is most important to you
is not most important to others. Right.

1950
01:57:49,830 --> 01:57:52,660
It's like it's a very personal
idea of what's most important.

1951
01:57:52,661 --> 01:57:55,240
What's most important to starving people
right now is getting them food and

1952
01:57:55,241 --> 01:57:56,074
water.
Right.

1953
01:57:56,260 --> 01:58:01,260
What's most important to the president
is figuring out what to do about Israel

1954
01:58:01,301 --> 01:58:02,980
and Gaza. What's most important? You know,

1955
01:58:03,280 --> 01:58:05,830
there's like what is most
important is a very personal thing.

1956
01:58:06,210 --> 01:58:08,940
Yeah. And yet there seem
to be patterns, you know,

1957
01:58:08,941 --> 01:58:11,030
like people have certain values and,

1958
01:58:11,580 --> 01:58:15,960
and share those values with others and
there's a collective code that seems to

1959
01:58:15,961 --> 01:58:17,040
be running as well.

1960
01:58:18,470 --> 01:58:23,450
Yeah. And again, it boils back to
what, what is that collective code?

1961
01:58:23,510 --> 01:58:27,290
What's the purpose of it all?
Yeah. To facilitate society,

1962
01:58:27,320 --> 01:58:32,320
civilization and to move forward
with the progression of innovation

1963
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:36,120
till we become robots.

1964
01:58:39,030 --> 01:58:41,680
Until he figured out a way
to get out of here. I mean,

1965
01:58:41,950 --> 01:58:45,130
trend is obviously there, right? The
symbiotic connection that we have to,

1966
01:58:45,190 --> 01:58:47,230
you know, you don't want
even leave your phone behind.

1967
01:58:47,260 --> 01:58:49,510
You want to keep that sucker on you.
If you leave it behind,

1968
01:58:49,511 --> 01:58:52,810
you feel like you left a part of you back
there. Yeah. Oh my God. I left my hand.

1969
01:58:52,920 --> 01:58:56,990
You know, I got to go back
and get my hand. I mean, it's
almost similar. Yeah. My, uh,

1970
01:58:57,130 --> 01:59:01,510
outer outer cortex. Yeah. There's
a, there's something weird to that.

1971
01:59:02,130 --> 01:59:03,950
Does something says
something weird to our,

1972
01:59:03,951 --> 01:59:08,710
our desire that this
Marshall Mcluhan's idea,

1973
01:59:08,890 --> 01:59:11,230
but we're the sex objects
of the machine world,

1974
01:59:11,231 --> 01:59:15,370
that what we're doing is we're giving
birth like a caterpillar becoming a

1975
01:59:15,371 --> 01:59:15,971
butterfly.

1976
01:59:15,971 --> 01:59:20,971
We're unaware of our actions really
ultimately being a part of this transition

1977
01:59:21,581 --> 01:59:25,600
from the monkey body into
this new transcendent thing.

1978
01:59:26,320 --> 01:59:30,460
But then,
then the big question is,

1979
01:59:30,461 --> 01:59:34,210
what is that and what's the purpose
of that? And if we do become that,

1980
01:59:34,211 --> 01:59:37,620
does it just sit? Does it say,
what's the point moving? No,

1981
01:59:37,630 --> 01:59:41,500
I'm just going to sit here. What's the
point in innovating? There's no need.

1982
01:59:41,770 --> 01:59:46,450
What's the point in creating new ones
to what do more of nothing? Fuck it.

1983
01:59:46,750 --> 01:59:47,920
It's,
it just sits there.

1984
01:59:47,921 --> 01:59:52,780
So we show up on some planet someday
and there's like these super complex

1985
01:59:53,080 --> 01:59:56,830
artificial beings that were created by
biological beings and then they just

1986
01:59:56,831 --> 02:00:00,220
stopped and they all just sat around
waiting for the next stage of existence.

1987
02:00:00,670 --> 02:00:01,540
And it never came

1988
02:00:02,190 --> 02:00:07,150
in Buddhist cosmology actually
it's described that way.
Yeah. Actually the, uh,

1989
02:00:07,230 --> 02:00:11,310
there's six realms in the Buddhist
cosmology and one of the realms is the God

1990
02:00:11,311 --> 02:00:12,900
realm.
And in the God realm,

1991
02:00:13,050 --> 02:00:18,050
the gods literally just abide in his
formless awareness for like eons and eons

1992
02:00:19,350 --> 02:00:22,360
and eons. But at some
point the story goes, um,

1993
02:00:22,650 --> 02:00:25,830
something changes and they die.
They do have,

1994
02:00:25,860 --> 02:00:29,550
they also are born and die,
does formless realms aren't,

1995
02:00:29,790 --> 02:00:32,250
aren't permanent.
And so the,

1996
02:00:32,251 --> 02:00:34,800
at some point they like come
out of it and then they die.

1997
02:00:34,801 --> 02:00:36,600
Then they get reborn
into some other realm.

1998
02:00:37,080 --> 02:00:40,890
Well, if you stop and think about the
birth and death of stars and planets,

1999
02:00:40,891 --> 02:00:44,250
if these artificial
beings live on planets,

2000
02:00:44,910 --> 02:00:47,880
they have a life time,
a lifespan,

2001
02:00:47,940 --> 02:00:51,760
whether they like it or not because
they're very solar system they exist in,

2002
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:56,100
is dependent upon that. Star burning
a finite amount of fuel, right?

2003
02:00:56,610 --> 02:01:01,140
Whether it's 500 billion years or whatever
the hell your stars gotten its tank,

2004
02:01:01,590 --> 02:01:05,550
when that sucker is out, it's going
to Supernova. And that's a wrap son.

2005
02:01:05,610 --> 02:01:09,180
There's no more artificial intelligence
on that rock that's spinning around in

2006
02:01:09,181 --> 02:01:12,420
space.
And the question is,

2007
02:01:12,421 --> 02:01:17,070
does the artificial intelligence that
exists recognize that and feel the need to

2008
02:01:17,071 --> 02:01:22,071
protect itself from this finite existence
by building a spaceship and traveling

2009
02:01:23,130 --> 02:01:25,650
physically traveling from
dimension to dimension

2010
02:01:26,830 --> 02:01:30,910
or traveling within the dimension of
consciousness and looking for a resolution

2011
02:01:30,911 --> 02:01:31,340
there,

2012
02:01:31,340 --> 02:01:35,990
but does it have consciousness once
it becomes artificial, what is con?

2013
02:01:36,010 --> 02:01:39,020
Is consciousness purely something that
the universe is created and we can't?

2014
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:43,910
Oh, I doubt that. Really. Yeah. You think
we'll be able to recreate consciousness?

2015
02:01:45,530 --> 02:01:49,430
I think if we, I mean I'm, I'm,
this is just a kind of guests,

2016
02:01:49,431 --> 02:01:54,431
but I think if we create a suitable
substrate for consciousness,

2017
02:01:56,301 --> 02:02:00,880
consciousness will appear. And that's
based on my assumption that, you know,

2018
02:02:00,890 --> 02:02:05,390
consciousness appears. Where

2019
02:02:09,270 --> 02:02:11,750
wait, where there's something
happening. There's some sense of it,

2020
02:02:11,910 --> 02:02:13,670
of Kering to something.

2021
02:02:14,020 --> 02:02:17,040
Well, it depends on what we're
calling consciousness. Yeah,

2022
02:02:17,200 --> 02:02:19,780
I use it in a simple way,
like just basic awareness,

2023
02:02:20,110 --> 02:02:23,710
like just kind of the awareness of like
being in this room of, of, of sight,

2024
02:02:23,711 --> 02:02:27,940
of sound. So animal and even insects
have consciousness in that sense.

2025
02:02:27,970 --> 02:02:29,410
And Alford North

2026
02:02:29,410 --> 02:02:30,260
head, you know, he,

2027
02:02:30,850 --> 02:02:34,840
he sort of presumed that even Adams
have a most fundamental sense of

2028
02:02:34,841 --> 02:02:38,740
consciousness that he called prehension.
Mm. Um, and I don't know if that's,

2029
02:02:38,741 --> 02:02:42,640
it's kind of like a pantheistic
perspective, but um, I,

2030
02:02:43,270 --> 02:02:46,780
I think everything is imbued at the most
fundamental level with consciousness.

2031
02:02:47,200 --> 02:02:47,770
But that's,

2032
02:02:47,770 --> 02:02:52,120
that's probably because I've been spent
my whole life exploring consciousness.

2033
02:02:53,650 --> 02:02:57,010
Well, you, when you say everything, do
you mean like physical objects as well?

2034
02:02:57,011 --> 02:02:59,380
Like a desk? Like does this
desk have consciousness? Yeah,

2035
02:02:59,381 --> 02:03:03,490
look at the most basic level,
some form of,

2036
02:03:03,491 --> 02:03:06,470
but non measurable.
So completely just

2037
02:03:06,850 --> 02:03:09,780
conscious.
Radical consciousness is consciousness.

2038
02:03:10,050 --> 02:03:12,530
Consciousness isn't by
definition immeasurable.

2039
02:03:13,410 --> 02:03:16,020
You can't measure consciousness
because it's not a quantity.

2040
02:03:16,150 --> 02:03:19,090
Right. Why would you assume that in and
out of it? An object's possess it then.

2041
02:03:21,400 --> 02:03:22,090
Okay.

2042
02:03:22,090 --> 02:03:22,840
It's,

2043
02:03:22,840 --> 02:03:27,840
it's sort of just comes from a comp comes
from the deepest states of meditation

2044
02:03:28,300 --> 02:03:29,680
that I've experienced.

2045
02:03:29,681 --> 02:03:33,210
This kind of sense of knowing
that everything is at the fund,

2046
02:03:33,211 --> 02:03:36,970
that most fundamental level consciousness
itself and so that there isn't

2047
02:03:36,971 --> 02:03:39,820
something outside of consciousness.
You know,

2048
02:03:40,330 --> 02:03:42,940
Adam's couldn't exist outside
of consciousness. It's just,

2049
02:03:42,941 --> 02:03:46,090
it's just a felt sense I guess.
It's hard to describe.

2050
02:03:46,390 --> 02:03:48,790
Like I don't have like a
really solid argument for it

2051
02:03:48,990 --> 02:03:52,020
and even if something
appears solid at a very

2052
02:03:53,610 --> 02:03:56,400
microscopic level,
we can see things moving around.

2053
02:03:56,430 --> 02:03:59,910
Like even though this table feels solid,
it's not completely solid.

2054
02:04:00,170 --> 02:04:04,100
Right, of course. Yeah. Every
atom is mostly air empty space.

2055
02:04:04,390 --> 02:04:06,580
Yeah.
So at a sense like you know,

2056
02:04:07,180 --> 02:04:11,710
I've had experiences too
where the concentration
becomes so strong that things

2057
02:04:11,711 --> 02:04:15,520
just start to break down and
everything seems to be dissolving and

2058
02:04:15,521 --> 02:04:17,490
reconstructing and dissolving
and reconstructing.

2059
02:04:18,220 --> 02:04:22,630
It isn't just, just the perceptions of
your own mind, isn't this just the, the,

2060
02:04:22,640 --> 02:04:25,220
your, your mind has this
ability to perceive its a,

2061
02:04:25,221 --> 02:04:27,020
its surroundings and its environment.

2062
02:04:27,290 --> 02:04:32,140
And in meditation you're altering
the parameters, you're changing the,

2063
02:04:32,141 --> 02:04:35,570
the influences, your, you're
changing the physical state,

2064
02:04:35,600 --> 02:04:38,010
the flow of the neurotransmitters and

2065
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:42,360
all these different things are changing
how you view the environment itself.

2066
02:04:42,361 --> 02:04:45,180
But you're not really changing
the environment at all.

2067
02:04:47,680 --> 02:04:51,700
Yeah. Mitigates, it depends on
how you look at it. Cause no,

2068
02:04:51,701 --> 02:04:53,290
I mean I'm not changing it and then yes,

2069
02:04:53,291 --> 02:04:56,470
I am changing it by doing
this particular practices.

2070
02:04:57,020 --> 02:04:59,270
You're changing it in that
you're changing your perceptions,

2071
02:04:59,920 --> 02:05:01,930
perceptions changed the
way your interface with it.

2072
02:05:02,030 --> 02:05:06,590
Yeah. I think this goes back
to the paradox of like it
is very paradoxical. Yeah.

2073
02:05:06,591 --> 02:05:09,110
Like the paradox of, you know, do it,

2074
02:05:09,111 --> 02:05:11,930
can we describe this from the outside
objective objectively and like that's the

2075
02:05:11,931 --> 02:05:14,210
most true perspective
or do we describe it as,

2076
02:05:14,270 --> 02:05:17,830
as the subjective conscious
experience of it and on which mode,

2077
02:05:17,900 --> 02:05:19,160
which is more true.

2078
02:05:19,370 --> 02:05:23,450
And I keep going back to like you can't
reduce one to the other or conflate one

2079
02:05:23,451 --> 02:05:25,580
to the other. Um, entirely.

2080
02:05:25,640 --> 02:05:30,640
Otherwise you basically are just sort of
propping up a particular perspective as

2081
02:05:31,311 --> 02:05:35,340
the ultimate truth. Um, I dunno, I think,

2082
02:05:35,341 --> 02:05:38,240
I think there's something completely
disenchanted about seeing everything as

2083
02:05:38,241 --> 02:05:39,520
physical objects and,

2084
02:05:39,850 --> 02:05:44,690
and this as a kind of just
like hallucination to make
us feel better so we can

2085
02:05:44,691 --> 02:05:45,740
continue to propagate.

2086
02:05:46,070 --> 02:05:50,000
I think there's something fundamentally
wrong about that on the level of being a

2087
02:05:50,001 --> 02:05:54,610
conscious being. And yet I also
see, you know, the tendency for um,

2088
02:05:55,040 --> 02:05:59,450
people to conflate their own experiences
with the external universe as being

2089
02:05:59,451 --> 02:06:01,840
like highly problematic
too. That's a funny, yeah.

2090
02:06:01,920 --> 02:06:03,250
Word.
Disenchanted.

2091
02:06:05,550 --> 02:06:08,910
That's a funny way of cause it is,
you know,

2092
02:06:09,180 --> 02:06:12,870
it is kind of your, your, the
way your perception of it.

2093
02:06:12,990 --> 02:06:13,823
Okay.

2094
02:06:14,400 --> 02:06:19,400
Is that it's almost like
this mystical view of it.

2095
02:06:19,860 --> 02:06:21,450
This is beautiful,

2096
02:06:22,260 --> 02:06:26,760
airy fairy view of it and
makes it more exciting.

2097
02:06:27,270 --> 02:06:32,270
And so like to think of them is to think
of it and more stoic terms or more,

2098
02:06:34,230 --> 02:06:38,610
you know, more, um, I don't know
what the word I would use, just more,

2099
02:06:40,070 --> 02:06:43,790
more clearly defined terms.
It's like not as fun.

2100
02:06:45,860 --> 02:06:48,260
Does that make sense? It does. Um,

2101
02:06:50,440 --> 02:06:52,750
it's also,
I think like Emily was saying,

2102
02:06:52,751 --> 02:06:56,080
like the moment we solidify reality,

2103
02:06:56,830 --> 02:07:01,690
then like we lose the background,

2104
02:07:01,720 --> 02:07:03,370
you know,
that we'd lose the sense that

2105
02:07:05,230 --> 02:07:08,830
we don't actually completely know that
every story we've ever told, you know,

2106
02:07:08,831 --> 02:07:12,640
as a species has ended up being wrong
at some level. You know, it's not,

2107
02:07:12,760 --> 02:07:15,150
it's not actually did like the big bang.
You know,

2108
02:07:15,940 --> 02:07:19,390
at some point we're going to realize that
story was the best story we could come

2109
02:07:19,391 --> 02:07:23,110
up with to describe the evolution of the
physical universe or the development of

2110
02:07:23,111 --> 02:07:25,300
it or whatever. But at
some point, you know,

2111
02:07:25,330 --> 02:07:28,330
we're going to discover something
that just blows our minds again,

2112
02:07:28,660 --> 02:07:30,940
and then we're gonna have to come up
with a new story that can make sense of

2113
02:07:30,941 --> 02:07:34,540
that and, and we're going to
get solidified about that.
We're going to think, oh,

2114
02:07:34,541 --> 02:07:36,870
that's the way it really is.
Hmm.

2115
02:07:37,030 --> 02:07:39,970
And so I think there's something
about certainty, you know,

2116
02:07:39,971 --> 02:07:44,971
and really thinking we have it worked
out that it becomes problematic at some

2117
02:07:45,761 --> 02:07:47,000
level.
That's kind of the

2118
02:07:47,040 --> 02:07:50,270
beauty of existence, right?
Is that there's a lot of
mystery to this thing, right?

2119
02:07:50,320 --> 02:07:54,120
Yeah. It's like half the half the fun.
Right? Exactly. Yes. A disenchantment.

2120
02:07:54,121 --> 02:07:55,270
Like it's part of that right

2121
02:07:55,310 --> 02:07:56,140
comes from like,

2122
02:07:56,140 --> 02:07:59,860
I feel like people can get disconnected
from their hearts and that can be airy

2123
02:07:59,861 --> 02:08:04,180
fairy too, but it's, it's that is real to,

2124
02:08:04,250 --> 02:08:07,930
to be up in the mind and the brain
and then forget that there is,

2125
02:08:08,230 --> 02:08:11,290
there is the feelings and the
tenderness and the vulnerability in a,

2126
02:08:11,291 --> 02:08:14,950
in a positive way. Cause there's actually
a lot of power in the vulnerability. So,

2127
02:08:15,300 --> 02:08:15,640
um,

2128
02:08:15,640 --> 02:08:19,870
there's some sort of balance that I think
it comes in to play from some of the

2129
02:08:19,871 --> 02:08:23,490
eastern traditions and then some of
the western traditions because I,

2130
02:08:23,710 --> 02:08:28,330
I feel that balance too in the room as
we're talking, um, between, you know,

2131
02:08:28,331 --> 02:08:31,780
opening more into the mystical part
of things and then also, you know,

2132
02:08:31,781 --> 02:08:35,500
needing to concept, naming the
rational mind, needing the science. Um,

2133
02:08:35,590 --> 02:08:38,920
and where is that balance in our
modern world? I don't, I'm not sure.

2134
02:08:39,340 --> 02:08:42,400
Well, yeah, that's the
real question, right?

2135
02:08:42,460 --> 02:08:44,170
Where's the balance in the modern world?

2136
02:08:44,171 --> 02:08:46,540
Because the modern world is
essentially without balance.

2137
02:08:46,810 --> 02:08:50,560
That's the number one criticism of
it is that we're raping the earth and

2138
02:08:50,561 --> 02:08:51,970
torturing our,
our,

2139
02:08:52,060 --> 02:08:56,260
our planet and robbing it of its resources
and polluting the oceans and all that

2140
02:08:56,261 --> 02:08:58,150
jazz.
And that there isn't a balance to it all.

2141
02:08:58,630 --> 02:09:03,080
And that the experience is
just what it is for you.

2142
02:09:03,700 --> 02:09:04,301
You,
you know,

2143
02:09:04,301 --> 02:09:09,040
you live this life and your perceptions
and your ideas are essentially what

2144
02:09:09,041 --> 02:09:13,810
flavor it for you. And if you, if
you choose to be mister no nonsense,

2145
02:09:13,990 --> 02:09:18,760
you still die. You know, you live, you
die and that's it. And you saw blind spot.

2146
02:09:18,790 --> 02:09:22,630
Yeah. You still limitations.
Yeah, most certainly.

2147
02:09:23,020 --> 02:09:25,030
And um, the, the,

2148
02:09:25,330 --> 02:09:30,330
the concept of consciousness in this
way is more empowering or at least gives

2149
02:09:31,271 --> 02:09:36,271
you a better feeling about the life
that you're living and may enhance that

2150
02:09:37,391 --> 02:09:41,020
experience, may make that
experience a more pleasurable ride

2151
02:09:41,100 --> 02:09:44,610
and it may impact others around you
cause a mirror and everything else.

2152
02:09:45,170 --> 02:09:48,680
Yeah. Well, definitely, you know, when
I'm around people that are super positive,

2153
02:09:48,681 --> 02:09:53,270
I feel better. It's this,
that's undeniable. I don't
understand it, but I do,

2154
02:09:53,570 --> 02:09:58,130
you know, inherently this is like a
part of you that grasps it. But, uh,

2155
02:09:58,160 --> 02:10:02,090
it's undeniable. And when you're around
pessimistic people, it's a huge drag.

2156
02:10:02,720 --> 02:10:05,210
That's a huge drag to be
around super negative people.

2157
02:10:05,660 --> 02:10:08,260
Like I remember I had this really negative
girlfriend once when I broke up with

2158
02:10:08,270 --> 02:10:10,850
her. I remember dropping her
off and driving away going,

2159
02:10:11,540 --> 02:10:14,780
oh my God,
I'm free.

2160
02:10:15,530 --> 02:10:19,400
What if there was a, uh, a side
of things? It was negative.

2161
02:10:19,401 --> 02:10:21,600
She would find it and
just start pecking at it,

2162
02:10:21,710 --> 02:10:25,950
eh. And B, what about fat
man? Oh, it was brutal.

2163
02:10:26,040 --> 02:10:29,640
It was brutal. And that, that, you know,

2164
02:10:30,480 --> 02:10:35,000
if you can find the opposite of that,
find someone who's got a good take. Like,

2165
02:10:35,001 --> 02:10:39,590
Hey, this is what it is. But from here,
well, we can learn to never do that again.

2166
02:10:39,650 --> 02:10:43,250
And so this is an awesome blessing and
that we've learned a lesson from this and

2167
02:10:43,550 --> 02:10:45,350
we're going to move forward.
And you know,

2168
02:10:45,351 --> 02:10:48,590
we still have love and
community and friendship and
there's a lot of people that

2169
02:10:48,591 --> 02:10:51,020
look at things that way and there's
so much more fun to be around.

2170
02:10:51,021 --> 02:10:56,021
It just makes the experience
of life itself more exciting
and in that sense what

2171
02:10:56,660 --> 02:10:57,170
we,

2172
02:10:57,170 --> 02:11:02,170
what people are doing with Buddhism or
TM or spending a lot of time in isolation

2173
02:11:02,601 --> 02:11:07,100
tanks or it's sort of a
workaround for biology, sort of a,

2174
02:11:07,780 --> 02:11:12,780
a framework for developing your
consciousness as you manage your biology.

2175
02:11:15,460 --> 02:11:19,540
Does that make sense? Yeah, I think
that's a valid way of talking about it.

2176
02:11:20,290 --> 02:11:24,030
We might've run out of mind fucks
in this podcast. I think we hit it.

2177
02:11:24,640 --> 02:11:27,760
We hit a wall self correcting

2178
02:11:27,940 --> 02:11:32,020
Peter Code at James Gates and Neil Tyson,
my thrown us into a wall.

2179
02:11:32,920 --> 02:11:35,920
It's just too, how did you guys get
involved in all this stuff? Like what,

2180
02:11:35,980 --> 02:11:39,880
what made you gravitate
towards this as a young person?

2181
02:11:41,140 --> 02:11:46,140
Is it just something you discovered
early on and sort of slowly but surely it

2182
02:11:46,361 --> 02:11:48,520
became a massive part of your life?

2183
02:11:49,240 --> 02:11:54,090
Um, for I think for, for both
of us, that's probably true.
I won't speak for Emily,

2184
02:11:54,091 --> 02:11:58,320
but uh, for, for me, I grew
up with hippie parents,

2185
02:11:58,920 --> 02:12:00,720
you know, uh, new agey parents.

2186
02:12:00,721 --> 02:12:04,080
And so the notion of meditation
and consciousness was,

2187
02:12:04,140 --> 02:12:07,590
was kind of part of the dialectic
growing up. Where'd you grow up?

2188
02:12:07,830 --> 02:12:09,840
I grew up in Asheville,
North Carolina.

2189
02:12:09,920 --> 02:12:13,490
Aww. I love that place. That's
where Dunkin's from. Yeah.
That's where we live now.

2190
02:12:13,730 --> 02:12:16,220
You guys live there?
Yeah. Place is so awesome.

2191
02:12:16,221 --> 02:12:19,130
I don't want to tell people about
it. So awesome. When I was there,

2192
02:12:19,131 --> 02:12:21,230
I was walking down the street.
I was like, this is like,

2193
02:12:21,290 --> 02:12:25,900
it doesn't exist in anywhere else. The
word's getting out, believe me. Dammit.

2194
02:12:27,470 --> 02:12:32,390
Yeah. Now it's really out. That
place is amazing. That's an amazing,

2195
02:12:32,391 --> 02:12:34,750
amazing town. It's
quite interesting. Yeah.

2196
02:12:35,400 --> 02:12:36,840
It's so unusual.

2197
02:12:37,230 --> 02:12:41,070
Like I was there with a buddy and
we'll Dunkin and another buddy of mine,

2198
02:12:41,071 --> 02:12:43,860
we were walking on the street and go
into this restaurant and then we went to

2199
02:12:43,861 --> 02:12:47,040
this bar. I was like, where
else is there a place like this?

2200
02:12:47,430 --> 02:12:51,150
It's like this small town
of really likeminded folks.

2201
02:12:51,151 --> 02:12:55,800
Very Open minded, very
progressive, but very small.

2202
02:12:55,801 --> 02:12:58,600
What's the population there?
A Hundred K I think it isn't.

2203
02:12:58,720 --> 02:13:03,110
So it's very boulder sized. That's which
is another similar town like that. Yeah.

2204
02:13:03,870 --> 02:13:07,590
It's very sad. But you guys are
like tucked up in the mountains.

2205
02:13:07,910 --> 02:13:12,310
Well we're, we're in a hauler. The
hauler. We like it. Yeah. That's amazing.

2206
02:13:13,090 --> 02:13:16,920
How'd you get there? Um, I
grew up just outside of there,

2207
02:13:17,150 --> 02:13:20,230
a little town called Mars hill
and I grew up two hours away.

2208
02:13:20,940 --> 02:13:25,150
And Wilkesboro small town. Yes. And
you gravitated towards Asheville.

2209
02:13:25,180 --> 02:13:29,100
How well we, we actually lived in
boulder for about a decade. Really? Yeah.

2210
02:13:29,110 --> 02:13:32,250
We were working,
she was working at Naropa University.

2211
02:13:32,250 --> 02:13:36,000
I went to school there. Oh, that's
that freaky hippie university. Right.

2212
02:13:36,150 --> 02:13:39,930
Buddhist inspired we,
we call it the Buddhist inspired Harvard.

2213
02:13:39,970 --> 02:13:44,610
They have a class in Zen flower
arrangement. You Cubana. Yeah.

2214
02:13:44,670 --> 02:13:46,920
It didn't take that one, but
I like, this is hilarious.

2215
02:13:46,921 --> 02:13:50,940
You get an accredited class
and Zen flower arrangement.

2216
02:13:50,970 --> 02:13:54,330
The only place that I know of. Yeah. Yeah.

2217
02:13:55,080 --> 02:13:58,590
Which is also a kind of similar, it's
kind of similar kind of vibe. Yeah.

2218
02:13:58,730 --> 02:14:00,120
Boulder most certainly does.

2219
02:14:00,150 --> 02:14:03,870
And another place that's tucked in the
mountains and it's like there's something

2220
02:14:03,871 --> 02:14:05,640
about mountains that are so humbling,

2221
02:14:05,970 --> 02:14:09,510
like you just look at it like
you can't be that important.

2222
02:14:09,570 --> 02:14:13,980
Are you seeing what I'm seeing? Like
your daily life and troubles? They,

2223
02:14:14,090 --> 02:14:18,890
they are balanced in perspective by the
images that you're seeing of the most

2224
02:14:18,891 --> 02:14:23,540
spectacular versions of
art that nature's created.

2225
02:14:23,690 --> 02:14:27,770
And then that's what the mountains are
to me, like snow covered, tree covered,

2226
02:14:27,771 --> 02:14:28,040
whatever.

2227
02:14:28,040 --> 02:14:33,040
They are seeing a lake at the bottom of
a canyon and just like nature's stunning

2228
02:14:35,371 --> 02:14:37,130
works of art.
And the,

2229
02:14:37,131 --> 02:14:40,860
the just the sheer vast magnitude of them,

2230
02:14:40,980 --> 02:14:45,330
like the Rockies forces people
to sort of humility. Oh yeah.

2231
02:14:45,820 --> 02:14:49,100
Sort of like beach towns,
you know like why are beach towns,

2232
02:14:49,101 --> 02:14:54,090
so why is everybody so chill by the beach?
We'll look at that fucking ocean, man.

2233
02:14:54,120 --> 02:14:57,930
Who are you? How are you taking yourself
so seriously, look at that thing.

2234
02:14:57,960 --> 02:14:58,650
It's fast.

2235
02:14:58,650 --> 02:15:03,160
You can't see the end and it's all
water and it's moving up and back.

2236
02:15:03,161 --> 02:15:08,010
And at any point in time it could just
rise up and a thousand mile high swell

2237
02:15:08,310 --> 02:15:12,230
and take out the entire
planet. That's right. Yeah.

2238
02:15:12,770 --> 02:15:15,470
There's something about nature
that's like super important. So I,

2239
02:15:15,471 --> 02:15:18,590
people that live in a, in a place where
they don't get a chance to see it,

2240
02:15:18,980 --> 02:15:19,520
you know,

2241
02:15:19,520 --> 02:15:24,520
in New York City in a sense is humbling
in its own way because as we said,

2242
02:15:25,881 --> 02:15:27,530
everything is natural.
You know,

2243
02:15:27,531 --> 02:15:31,250
human beings creating cities are
not much different than a beehive.

2244
02:15:31,640 --> 02:15:35,420
It's just we're way better at making shit
than bees are. So we make skyscrapers.

2245
02:15:35,810 --> 02:15:38,570
But when you're in Manhattan,
like, uh, last time I was there,

2246
02:15:38,571 --> 02:15:42,980
I was staying at this hotel and we
were pretty high up and uh, you know,

2247
02:15:42,981 --> 02:15:47,960
you open up your window and you look out
the window like, whoa, this is crazy.

2248
02:15:48,350 --> 02:15:51,530
This is so futuristic and bizarre.
We're in the middle of it.

2249
02:15:51,531 --> 02:15:53,060
Like all the buildings are around us.

2250
02:15:53,061 --> 02:15:56,480
We're seeing all these people moving
around inside of their windows.

2251
02:15:56,690 --> 02:15:59,060
Some of them I'm sure with binoculars,

2252
02:15:59,270 --> 02:16:02,990
telescopes and shit peering out at all
the different stories that are playing

2253
02:16:02,991 --> 02:16:06,560
out in the various little
cubicles and boxes around them.

2254
02:16:07,700 --> 02:16:12,490
Absolutely. Yeah. But,
um, I think that, uh, the,

2255
02:16:12,500 --> 02:16:17,380
the, at least to me, the most
peaceful version of that, those, the,

2256
02:16:17,480 --> 02:16:19,820
you know, that kind of imagery
is the natural version,

2257
02:16:20,030 --> 02:16:24,240
the real natural version as far as like
non men created I should say. You know,

2258
02:16:24,320 --> 02:16:28,070
the, the mountains and there's
something about it like,

2259
02:16:28,071 --> 02:16:32,730
especially like a place like Asheville
or a place like boulder sort of like, uh,

2260
02:16:32,870 --> 02:16:33,703
it,
it,

2261
02:16:34,230 --> 02:16:34,690
yeah.

2262
02:16:34,690 --> 02:16:37,140
It's just defined by its environment.
Yeah.

2263
02:16:38,810 --> 02:16:39,090
Okay.

2264
02:16:39,090 --> 02:16:41,130
So, um, the Buddhist geeks thing,

2265
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:44,010
one of the things that I thought that
was interesting that you said that I find

2266
02:16:44,011 --> 02:16:47,280
too is that you start doing it and people
start getting connected to it and then

2267
02:16:47,281 --> 02:16:50,820
you feel like you kind of stuck
in it like a in that like, boy,

2268
02:16:50,850 --> 02:16:53,730
I have a responsibility now
people are enjoying this.

2269
02:16:53,890 --> 02:16:56,650
Yes. Getting maybe, hopefully
getting some value from it.

2270
02:16:57,550 --> 02:17:02,020
Yeah. Well it at the very least
being entertained on a bus, you know,

2271
02:17:02,110 --> 02:17:06,160
or on a plane or, or what have you.
Are you stuck in a commute? You know,

2272
02:17:06,190 --> 02:17:09,740
at the very least it's that. Yeah.
How often you guys do it? Huh?

2273
02:17:09,900 --> 02:17:11,850
We do a podcast once a week,

2274
02:17:12,330 --> 02:17:15,900
so we do like a interview like
this or a conversation like this,

2275
02:17:15,930 --> 02:17:16,763
probably once a week.

2276
02:17:16,970 --> 02:17:18,980
Now when you do those,
do you prepare for them?

2277
02:17:18,981 --> 02:17:22,610
Like do you have like a theme or do you
have like questions that you lay out

2278
02:17:22,611 --> 02:17:23,710
beforehand and

2279
02:17:24,120 --> 02:17:27,900
usually, yeah, usually it's a, with a,
with a person or group that, you know,

2280
02:17:27,901 --> 02:17:29,860
we're exploring a particular topic like,
um,

2281
02:17:30,560 --> 02:17:34,230
and we've explored a lot around the
interface of technology and Buddhist

2282
02:17:34,231 --> 02:17:36,030
practice,
um,

2283
02:17:36,120 --> 02:17:39,630
various intersection points of how
Buddhism is sort of interfacing with

2284
02:17:39,631 --> 02:17:44,460
psychology and science and technology
and you know, various aspects of culture.

2285
02:17:44,760 --> 02:17:48,360
So we'll usually kind of go into one of
those intersection points and explore it

2286
02:17:48,361 --> 02:17:52,290
with someone who's really been working at
that interface. And so who is, you know,

2287
02:17:52,291 --> 02:17:55,140
in some ways the most, um, informed

2288
02:17:56,420 --> 02:17:57,180
and

2289
02:17:57,180 --> 02:18:01,220
in terms of their ignorance about what's
going on at that interface and just

2290
02:18:01,230 --> 02:18:03,390
kind of explore it and see what happens.
Um,

2291
02:18:03,391 --> 02:18:06,450
and can you give me example of like one
of the recent episodes read today? Yeah,

2292
02:18:06,451 --> 02:18:08,770
sure. So we recently, uh, I talked to, um,

2293
02:18:08,880 --> 02:18:12,930
a neuroscientist named David Wago who's
at Harvard and he's a contemplative

2294
02:18:12,931 --> 02:18:15,960
neuroscientists. Um, and Jake Davis,

2295
02:18:15,961 --> 02:18:18,210
who's a Buddhist cognitive philosopher,

2296
02:18:18,600 --> 02:18:23,550
and we sort of explored some of their
recent work around finding and discovering

2297
02:18:23,551 --> 02:18:25,770
a neuroscience of enlightenment.
Um,

2298
02:18:25,771 --> 02:18:28,440
and they've been sort of
working with the question,

2299
02:18:28,770 --> 02:18:30,450
is there a neuroscience of enlightenment?

2300
02:18:30,451 --> 02:18:34,950
Can we see what enlightenment and
quotes looks like in the brain?

2301
02:18:35,250 --> 02:18:37,770
Um, and is that even possible
philosophically? Like,

2302
02:18:37,771 --> 02:18:40,810
is it enlightenment one thing
or is it many things? Um,

2303
02:18:40,830 --> 02:18:44,430
and so we really just went through and
explored some of their ideas around

2304
02:18:44,460 --> 02:18:47,730
enlightenment. What is it, uh,
what conceptions are they using? A,

2305
02:18:47,820 --> 02:18:50,250
what have they found
in their, in their, um,

2306
02:18:50,460 --> 02:18:54,530
in their research because David's been
working a lot with, um, folks, uh,

2307
02:18:54,600 --> 02:18:58,950
like Shinzen young who has been
meditating for 40 years and who you know,

2308
02:18:58,951 --> 02:19:01,810
has a really, you know, kind of, um,

2309
02:19:01,920 --> 02:19:05,520
complex system of meditation
and mindfulness practice
and it's something that he

2310
02:19:05,521 --> 02:19:07,830
designed to be able to be
scientifically studied.

2311
02:19:08,040 --> 02:19:11,610
So they've been sort of putting advanced
meditators and various fmri machines

2312
02:19:11,611 --> 02:19:14,700
and sort of seeing what happens
when they do various kinds of tasks,

2313
02:19:14,701 --> 02:19:17,880
seeing what happens when they have
these kind of peak moments, you know,

2314
02:19:17,881 --> 02:19:20,340
what actually is occurring in the,
in the nervous system,

2315
02:19:20,520 --> 02:19:23,760
seeing if they can come up with a model
to describe that. Neuroscientifically

2316
02:19:24,090 --> 02:19:28,430
that's fascinating.
The Fmr Ri is a really interesting stuff.

2317
02:19:28,610 --> 02:19:29,920
Oh yeah.
And

2318
02:19:30,230 --> 02:19:32,720
have you ever been in one?
It's so weird. No, no.

2319
02:19:32,750 --> 02:19:36,890
It's like a shamonic drum beating
through your head. Really.

2320
02:19:37,280 --> 02:19:38,930
It's really bizarre.
And when I,

2321
02:19:39,050 --> 02:19:42,200
when we got in there for one of these
meditation studies afterwards, I was like,

2322
02:19:42,650 --> 02:19:46,460
are they taking into account the fact
that the FMRI machine itself is like a

2323
02:19:46,461 --> 02:19:50,930
completely altered state experience?
It's just a huge magnet. Your, yeah.

2324
02:19:51,430 --> 02:19:56,130
I've been in an MRI before. She's similar.
You hear that tone, Dum, Dum, Dum,

2325
02:19:56,290 --> 02:19:57,350
Dum.
Yeah.

2326
02:19:57,690 --> 02:19:59,610
This one had like the
one we went to like had,

2327
02:19:59,820 --> 02:20:04,140
I mean what sounded like drum beats and
all kinds of weird stuff. I mean, I was,

2328
02:20:04,470 --> 02:20:06,950
wow. Yeah. I mean, I don't know
if it was like that for you now.

2329
02:20:06,960 --> 02:20:08,290
That's what it sounded like. Yeah, yeah.

2330
02:20:08,880 --> 02:20:10,110
It was weird.
Yeah.

2331
02:20:10,111 --> 02:20:13,980
I talked to a neuroscientist and they
were explaining that there's some issues

2332
02:20:13,981 --> 02:20:15,520
with Fmr eyes where they're,

2333
02:20:15,521 --> 02:20:20,521
they're trying to use them for a crime
investigation and they're being used by

2334
02:20:21,211 --> 02:20:23,700
people who don't understand the
limitations of the technology.

2335
02:20:23,850 --> 02:20:26,440
So someone was accused
of a crime in India,

2336
02:20:26,460 --> 02:20:29,850
crew accused of murder
and convicted by an Fmr.

2337
02:20:29,851 --> 02:20:34,770
I result because the FMRs showed
functional knowledge of the crime scene.

2338
02:20:35,870 --> 02:20:38,040
Ooh, yeah. Ooh, exactly.

2339
02:20:38,270 --> 02:20:43,200
And she was very concerned about this
because her perceptions of it where you

2340
02:20:43,201 --> 02:20:48,201
could by reviewing the case itself
and by reviewing the information,

2341
02:20:50,341 --> 02:20:54,090
you could give someone functional
knowledge of a crime scene without them

2342
02:20:54,091 --> 02:20:58,620
actually having been there while the
crime scene was going on. And that,

2343
02:20:58,650 --> 02:21:02,160
so if you could read that there's
functional knowledge of a crime scene,

2344
02:21:02,161 --> 02:21:06,210
it doesn't mean that the
person is actually been there
while the crime was being

2345
02:21:06,211 --> 02:21:07,860
played out.
I mean there's,

2346
02:21:07,861 --> 02:21:12,861
there's people that have
functional knowledge of all
sorts of places like Mount

2347
02:21:13,020 --> 02:21:13,700
Rushmore and put,
you know,

2348
02:21:13,700 --> 02:21:18,270
like if you play that in some folks head
that are like deeply studied history

2349
02:21:18,271 --> 02:21:19,260
and been paying a lot of tension,

2350
02:21:19,470 --> 02:21:22,950
you might be able to show some sort of a
functional knowledge of the area itself.

2351
02:21:23,130 --> 02:21:27,900
If they have, specially if they have
a vested interest in studying this,

2352
02:21:27,901 --> 02:21:30,330
like they're being accused of a murder,
you know,

2353
02:21:30,331 --> 02:21:33,720
you would think there'd
be a lot of intensity and
emotional connection to that.

2354
02:21:34,410 --> 02:21:37,650
But these concepts like all these
different things is when it comes to

2355
02:21:37,770 --> 02:21:40,440
technology and the understanding
of the human brain.

2356
02:21:40,441 --> 02:21:44,790
There's so they're evolving right now in
front of us so rapidly. Yeah, it's true.

2357
02:21:45,180 --> 02:21:46,013
I mean

2358
02:21:46,190 --> 02:21:48,590
just recently in the
contemplative neuroscience field,

2359
02:21:48,591 --> 02:21:53,591
they discovered that when you're not
doing anything that is like your baseline

2360
02:21:53,601 --> 02:21:57,290
state, that you are in fact doing
something. And they just sort of,

2361
02:21:57,350 --> 02:22:00,200
that was one of the big insights that
came out of a contemplative neuroscience

2362
02:22:00,201 --> 02:22:04,400
was that the default mode network of the
brain is actually the selfing network.

2363
02:22:04,401 --> 02:22:08,710
It's the network that is constantly
constructing the sense of identity and

2364
02:22:08,780 --> 02:22:12,470
referencing one self even when you're not
doing anything. So that was, you know,

2365
02:22:12,471 --> 02:22:15,440
the assumption prior to that was just
like, when you're not doing anything,

2366
02:22:15,441 --> 02:22:19,520
nothing's happening. Um, but no,
actually a lot of stuff's happening.

2367
02:22:19,521 --> 02:22:22,490
It's like yourself program
is running basically.

2368
02:22:23,290 --> 02:22:27,000
Yeah. What, what? Well, we don't
understand. What the fuck is,

2369
02:22:27,030 --> 02:22:29,330
is that self program.
That's the problem.

2370
02:22:29,520 --> 02:22:31,590
How much of that is just
keeping the heart beating?

2371
02:22:31,591 --> 02:22:35,760
How much of that is maintaining a normal
state without freaking out and ripping

2372
02:22:35,761 --> 02:22:37,470
your clothes off,
running into traffic,

2373
02:22:37,471 --> 02:22:40,300
and what causes you to freak out and
rip your clothes off and running into

2374
02:22:40,301 --> 02:22:40,801
traffic.

2375
02:22:40,801 --> 02:22:45,801
And do you find that having these shows
and doing all these podcasts has given

2376
02:22:47,401 --> 02:22:52,401
you a like a window that you would
have normally not had before?

2377
02:22:52,720 --> 02:22:53,970
Oh, totally, totally.

2378
02:22:53,971 --> 02:22:58,740
I can't separate now out the experience
of talking to all these people and

2379
02:22:58,741 --> 02:23:03,741
exploring some of the topics that we
explore from my experience now of how I

2380
02:23:05,791 --> 02:23:08,310
understand the world, it's
just, it's so intertwined.

2381
02:23:08,610 --> 02:23:10,680
I'm sure you can kind of relate to that.
Yeah.

2382
02:23:10,681 --> 02:23:14,910
That's why I wanted to ask you because
it becomes like a part of your life is

2383
02:23:14,970 --> 02:23:18,450
not just about having these conversations
but about broadcasts in these

2384
02:23:18,451 --> 02:23:20,580
conversations. Yeah. And exploring them,

2385
02:23:20,581 --> 02:23:25,581
not just through your own curiosity but
through trying to either a luminate or

2386
02:23:26,821 --> 02:23:31,590
figure out a way to express these ideas
across where you think they're going to

2387
02:23:31,591 --> 02:23:36,591
be accepted or understood the best.

2388
02:23:37,470 --> 02:23:39,570
Understood is probably the
best way to describe it.

2389
02:23:39,571 --> 02:23:43,800
Like the way it's going to interface
with the most amount of people. Yeah,

2390
02:23:43,830 --> 02:23:48,120
I mean sometimes I think it's one of the
most grandiose things to do is to start

2391
02:23:48,121 --> 02:23:51,450
a podcast or to start, you
know, to be a media person.

2392
02:23:51,451 --> 02:23:54,870
And I sometimes wonder
if I myself as a result,

2393
02:23:55,730 --> 02:23:58,340
just being a,
he started the podcast seven years ago,

2394
02:23:58,341 --> 02:24:00,770
so I've kind of been on the periphery
of it and just watching it from the

2395
02:24:00,771 --> 02:24:02,240
outside perspective too.

2396
02:24:02,241 --> 02:24:06,680
It's fairly interesting to see how like
his podcasts and the stuff that he talks

2397
02:24:06,681 --> 02:24:08,160
about in his own development as,

2398
02:24:08,240 --> 02:24:11,900
I don't know if you can relate to it has
really come across in each episode as

2399
02:24:11,901 --> 02:24:16,820
it's, and now we have an archive of seven
years of like development of, you know,

2400
02:24:16,821 --> 02:24:21,821
his own understanding and then how
everything just kind of co like converges.

2401
02:24:22,970 --> 02:24:24,680
Now we're really
exploring the convergence.

2402
02:24:24,960 --> 02:24:25,051
Well,

2403
02:24:25,051 --> 02:24:28,980
the beautiful thing about a podcast is
that you don't have someone telling you

2404
02:24:28,981 --> 02:24:30,660
what the subject of today's going to be.

2405
02:24:30,870 --> 02:24:33,360
You don't have someone telling you this
is what you should be interested in.

2406
02:24:33,720 --> 02:24:34,700
You know,
you,

2407
02:24:34,720 --> 02:24:39,510
you find these unique individual visions
because a podcast and some of them are

2408
02:24:39,511 --> 02:24:42,240
ridiculous, stupid and some
of them are awesome, you know,

2409
02:24:42,241 --> 02:24:45,570
and what's ridiculously stupid
to me is awesome to someone else.

2410
02:24:45,571 --> 02:24:49,740
And that's the kind of the beauty of
podcasting and it goes along with what

2411
02:24:49,741 --> 02:24:53,520
we're talking about. I think when it
comes to technology and social media,

2412
02:24:53,550 --> 02:24:58,260
it's like the, the interfacing with ideas,
the ability to exchange information.

2413
02:24:58,620 --> 02:25:02,460
It's all sort of radically changing
right in front of us. And you know,

2414
02:25:02,461 --> 02:25:06,600
podcasting is just a part of
that. Absolutely. How, um,

2415
02:25:07,440 --> 02:25:10,320
how do you feel like you're going
to take this thing into the future?

2416
02:25:10,321 --> 02:25:14,400
Do you have any plans for it? Are you
trying to expand it or you are you, uh,

2417
02:25:14,850 --> 02:25:19,110
you're nodding virtual, virtual
reality's next? I think like Oculus,

2418
02:25:19,111 --> 02:25:23,410
oculus rift style, podcasting.
Well, I mean, part of it, well,

2419
02:25:23,411 --> 02:25:24,244
that could happen.

2420
02:25:24,400 --> 02:25:27,680
Um, we'll see if that's popular, but Geez,

2421
02:25:27,760 --> 02:25:30,790
you know, I think, uh, you know, for us,

2422
02:25:31,010 --> 02:25:34,910
you know, we're doing Buddhist geeks as a
media project, but we're also, you know,

2423
02:25:34,911 --> 02:25:39,050
meditation teachers and we work a lot
with other folks. Um, and we've trained,

2424
02:25:39,080 --> 02:25:42,140
you know, with, with various
Buddhist teachers. So for us,

2425
02:25:42,141 --> 02:25:44,130
we're wanting to make a space both for,
you know,

2426
02:25:44,180 --> 02:25:48,240
these conversations but also for
people to practice together, um,

2427
02:25:48,740 --> 02:25:50,360
in virtual space.

2428
02:25:50,690 --> 02:25:54,920
So that's a lot of our focus lately is
on how to reinvent the Buddhist practice

2429
02:25:54,921 --> 02:25:56,810
tradition for the 21st century.

2430
02:25:57,380 --> 02:26:01,970
And a big part of that that we're working
on now is, is doing retreats online,

2431
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:03,710
you know,
periods of intensive,

2432
02:26:03,711 --> 02:26:08,380
immersive practice that happened in the
context of your life. And also, you know,

2433
02:26:08,420 --> 02:26:10,520
we're building what we're
conduct Buddhist geeks Dojo,

2434
02:26:10,580 --> 02:26:12,860
which is going to be kind of,

2435
02:26:12,861 --> 02:26:16,010
we're describing it as an early version
of the Matrix for training your mind,

2436
02:26:16,190 --> 02:26:19,970
the Buddhist geeks Dojo, the Buddhist
geeks Doge, and what does that entail?

2437
02:26:20,180 --> 02:26:21,500
What's going to be in there?
It'll,

2438
02:26:21,560 --> 02:26:25,220
it'll be at least a place for people to
meditate together to talk about what's

2439
02:26:25,221 --> 02:26:28,160
happening in their practice,
which basically as their life,

2440
02:26:28,550 --> 02:26:33,550
and to find a community of folks who
are kind of on a similar journey of,

2441
02:26:33,840 --> 02:26:37,520
of cultivating certain kinds of states
of mind and certain understandings.

2442
02:26:38,360 --> 02:26:42,200
Why Buddhism though? Or why
not? Why call it something?

2443
02:26:42,380 --> 02:26:45,380
Is that where it gets me when you're
talking about rebelling against Buddhism,

2444
02:26:45,381 --> 02:26:45,820
right?

2445
02:26:45,820 --> 02:26:46,570
Yeah.

2446
02:26:46,570 --> 02:26:51,570
Well we've rebelled and we've rebelled
against her and rebellion currently.

2447
02:26:53,960 --> 02:26:57,370
Yeah. I mean it's like if we don't call
it Buddhism, we'll call it something else.

2448
02:26:57,371 --> 02:27:00,010
And then there's a framework around that.
And so it's like,

2449
02:27:00,011 --> 02:27:03,280
I can't get outside of the framework
no matter how smart or a framework,

2450
02:27:03,281 --> 02:27:08,281
no matter how hard I try and my training
and has been with some really awesome

2451
02:27:08,621 --> 02:27:12,370
people in the Buddhist tradition and I'm
not going to be able to just let that,

2452
02:27:12,700 --> 02:27:14,950
you know, it's always going
to impact me and influence me.

2453
02:27:15,460 --> 02:27:19,870
And there's something about the flavor
of that tradition and what it reveals,

2454
02:27:19,900 --> 02:27:20,733
hippies

2455
02:27:22,270 --> 02:27:25,490
changing and it's changing. Look, I mean

2456
02:27:25,660 --> 02:27:26,493
it's changed.

2457
02:27:26,920 --> 02:27:30,430
You guys are changing it a little
bit because of technology and you're

2458
02:27:30,460 --> 02:27:33,490
interfacing with technology. I mean, yeah,
I mean, we're just a small part of it.

2459
02:27:33,491 --> 02:27:36,010
I mean, how else is it changing? I mean,

2460
02:27:36,700 --> 02:27:41,320
the science is coming in
really influencing it. The
mindfulness movement is very

2461
02:27:41,780 --> 02:27:46,040
much influenced, again, you
could call mindfulness a
form of secular Buddhism. Um,

2462
02:27:46,280 --> 02:27:48,410
I mean, certainly the
guy that, that had it,

2463
02:27:48,580 --> 02:27:53,540
that's had the most impact
on the mindfulness movement.
Jon Kabat Zinn was spent,

2464
02:27:53,690 --> 02:27:58,640
you know, a number of decades studying
Buddhism in India and Asia. So, I mean,

2465
02:27:58,670 --> 02:28:03,440
those things are very big shifts in
terms of how it's being practiced and the

2466
02:28:03,441 --> 02:28:07,400
context that it's being held
in. And, well, that's funny
that you said the secular,

2467
02:28:07,790 --> 02:28:11,920
because most people would
consider Buddhism to be a,

2468
02:28:11,990 --> 02:28:15,740
some sort of a, or maybe one
of the only saccular religions.

2469
02:28:16,700 --> 02:28:19,640
And it's, it's true in some
cases, in other cases, it's,

2470
02:28:19,730 --> 02:28:21,080
it's like a lot of other religions,

2471
02:28:21,260 --> 02:28:24,080
a lot of what's the
creepiest forms of Buddhism?

2472
02:28:25,950 --> 02:28:30,410
It must be, throw him under the bus,
creepiest for feel good. What's,

2473
02:28:31,070 --> 02:28:35,510
what's the most dogmatic, the
most, uh, ideology filled?

2474
02:28:37,250 --> 02:28:41,570
I mean, I must be right there.
I think Bikram Yoga. No,

2475
02:28:41,571 --> 02:28:43,570
I mean there are lots
of forms that you know,

2476
02:28:43,571 --> 02:28:47,690
that are very rigid in terms
of how they're taught and
what to believe when you

2477
02:28:47,691 --> 02:28:48,560
do them.
I mean,

2478
02:28:49,070 --> 02:28:52,010
I think that's hard to escape in a
certain way because when people find

2479
02:28:52,011 --> 02:28:55,520
something that was really powerful and
works, they get really fixated on it.

2480
02:28:55,940 --> 02:28:58,910
Right? Like wearing orange robes.
Yeah. Like wearing orange robes,

2481
02:28:58,911 --> 02:29:01,160
although that's not really
that popular anymore,

2482
02:29:01,161 --> 02:29:03,620
at least in its current form in the west.
It,

2483
02:29:03,710 --> 02:29:06,620
monasticism is not
definitely not taking off.

2484
02:29:07,670 --> 02:29:09,020
So that's one way it's changing.
Also,

2485
02:29:09,021 --> 02:29:12,680
it's moved away from monasticism
and toward this more kind of, um,

2486
02:29:12,710 --> 02:29:13,880
lay centered life,

2487
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:17,420
that being integrated with everyone else
being integrated in your life. You know,

2488
02:29:17,421 --> 02:29:20,690
how it is. And that's, I think that's true
of most religions that are doing well.

2489
02:29:20,691 --> 02:29:21,260
It's like they've,

2490
02:29:21,260 --> 02:29:24,260
they've moved away from the transcendent
and toward the imminent. You know,

2491
02:29:24,261 --> 02:29:24,860
they've,

2492
02:29:24,860 --> 02:29:28,580
they're reconceiving divinity as something
that exists in your life as it is.

2493
02:29:28,581 --> 02:29:31,640
It's not something that's beyond
your life in some way that,

2494
02:29:31,670 --> 02:29:35,480
that something's wrong with your life or
your, you know, your body that, you know,

2495
02:29:35,481 --> 02:29:39,650
this is a sin full, terrible vessel
that is completely limited. I mean,

2496
02:29:39,651 --> 02:29:42,950
and it is in one sense,
but in another sense like that's just,

2497
02:29:43,550 --> 02:29:47,390
that's an intermediary insight from,
from, you know, from my experience,

2498
02:29:47,540 --> 02:29:51,510
what are the confining aspects of calling
it Buddhism though? Like what, what is,

2499
02:29:51,560 --> 02:29:54,030
what are the pitfalls
of that besides hippies?

2500
02:29:55,110 --> 02:29:58,580
You definitely going to
get some problematic if not
that, oh, I love hippies.

2501
02:29:58,610 --> 02:30:02,960
Don't get me wrong. Yeah. Same Pete
hippies come in many shades. There's,

2502
02:30:03,020 --> 02:30:07,850
there's legit hippies and then there's
like really annoying hippies that just

2503
02:30:07,851 --> 02:30:12,590
sort of, you know, the, they use the
hippie framework to just be annoying.

2504
02:30:12,790 --> 02:30:15,710
[inaudible] sure. I mean, I'll,

2505
02:30:15,830 --> 02:30:20,480
I'll say one can finding thing is that um,
Buddhism as a religion,

2506
02:30:20,481 --> 02:30:24,590
I mean at least in terms of how we
understand religion, is it tax free? Uh,

2507
02:30:24,620 --> 02:30:26,060
is it tax free?
Yeah.

2508
02:30:26,061 --> 02:30:28,880
Do you have tax free exemption the
same way that other religions too? We,

2509
02:30:28,980 --> 02:30:32,800
we personally don't, but you
could, you could do that. Yeah.

2510
02:30:32,810 --> 02:30:35,390
You'll give fucking chase down.
Don't do it.

2511
02:30:37,490 --> 02:30:42,050
It gets really, really hairy
when you don't want to pay
taxes. They go, oh, really?

2512
02:30:42,350 --> 02:30:45,620
Time to take a little closer.
Look at the Buddhist Geek Organization.

2513
02:30:45,910 --> 02:30:48,530
See what you're doing on Saturday
nights there. Infiltrate.

2514
02:30:48,650 --> 02:30:50,960
Yeah. I think with anything like
Buddhism, I mean you inherit,

2515
02:30:51,110 --> 02:30:54,470
but choosing that framework,
we inherit all, we inherit it.

2516
02:30:54,620 --> 02:30:57,070
And so there's a lot about,
um,

2517
02:30:57,290 --> 02:31:00,770
religions and spirituality
in general that is not,

2518
02:31:01,310 --> 02:31:05,690
that I don't personally
like, you know, so, um,

2519
02:31:07,550 --> 02:31:10,850
I think that there is a,
there's a tendency to project,

2520
02:31:10,880 --> 02:31:12,200
I mean you brought in the word divinity,

2521
02:31:12,201 --> 02:31:16,610
so I'll use it like to
project our divinity onto the
teachers are onto some sort

2522
02:31:16,611 --> 02:31:20,820
of system and um,
it can disempowering for a lot of people.

2523
02:31:20,821 --> 02:31:22,910
People can get trapped and beliefs that,
you know,

2524
02:31:22,911 --> 02:31:27,750
we've had been carried forward for, you
know, years and centuries that aren't,

2525
02:31:27,900 --> 02:31:30,310
isn't forwarding anymore.
Um,

2526
02:31:30,320 --> 02:31:35,310
and so that sense like by choosing to go
under Buddhism, we're also choosing to,

2527
02:31:35,670 --> 02:31:40,020
you know, work on how we can
evolve, how we think about it.

2528
02:31:40,560 --> 02:31:45,210
And one thing that I really like is the,
is the practices themselves,

2529
02:31:45,530 --> 02:31:47,550
um,
the mind training aspect of it.

2530
02:31:47,640 --> 02:31:50,970
That's what's been really beneficial
to me and that's one of the reasons why

2531
02:31:50,971 --> 02:31:54,300
I've chosen to continue
because if its impact,

2532
02:31:54,810 --> 02:31:59,520
the mind training aspects
of it. Like what, what,

2533
02:31:59,570 --> 02:31:59,821
what,

2534
02:31:59,821 --> 02:32:03,700
what do you think is like the tangible
benefits of this mind training aspect of

2535
02:32:03,701 --> 02:32:05,160
it that you personally experience?

2536
02:32:05,440 --> 02:32:10,240
Personally I can say
personally I feel much,

2537
02:32:10,241 --> 02:32:14,800
much more, much more open. I'm
much more generous, compassionate.

2538
02:32:15,160 --> 02:32:19,900
There's a lot more freedom I can get
stuck on the smaller sense of self.

2539
02:32:19,901 --> 02:32:20,950
Meaning,
you know,

2540
02:32:20,951 --> 02:32:25,660
I have these thoughts of like unworthiness
or self contraction or hatred or any

2541
02:32:25,661 --> 02:32:29,350
of those, you know,
biological kind of urges.

2542
02:32:29,380 --> 02:32:33,670
And at the same time they're so
transient and they're so not who I am.

2543
02:32:33,671 --> 02:32:34,900
And I see that very,

2544
02:32:35,080 --> 02:32:38,860
very clearly that it kind of
diminishes in just a second.

2545
02:32:39,490 --> 02:32:40,810
I'm on the good days.

2546
02:32:40,840 --> 02:32:45,840
Sometimes it's more intense and I've
learned to really work with that and learn

2547
02:32:45,881 --> 02:32:50,881
how to see clearly what's happening so
that I have the freedom to really choose

2548
02:32:53,441 --> 02:32:56,170
how to live my life in
a much more full way.

2549
02:32:56,700 --> 02:33:01,230
So really is like a work around for a
lot of the biological pitfalls I think.

2550
02:33:01,231 --> 02:33:04,320
So I think it's a way of working
with the situation as it is.

2551
02:33:04,321 --> 02:33:08,070
And then making the most of it. If
someone came along with another name, no,

2552
02:33:08,610 --> 02:33:13,140
like Buddhist, like the word, the word
Buddhist. If someone came along with, uh,

2553
02:33:13,150 --> 02:33:17,850
another name for a similar practice,
do you think that it would be accepted?

2554
02:33:18,370 --> 02:33:18,970
Yeah,

2555
02:33:18,970 --> 02:33:19,450
there's some,

2556
02:33:19,450 --> 02:33:22,870
I think the Buddhist tradition and
especially in the West has been modified,

2557
02:33:22,990 --> 02:33:25,720
like mindfulness based stress reduction.
I mean,

2558
02:33:25,721 --> 02:33:30,430
some of these different techniques are
taking from the ancient techniques. Um,

2559
02:33:30,970 --> 02:33:34,210
there's something about grooves and
consciousness and patterns like we were

2560
02:33:34,211 --> 02:33:37,540
talking about earlier.
So by going under Buddhism,

2561
02:33:37,541 --> 02:33:41,460
we're kind of riding in those grooves
and they're not all bad, you know?

2562
02:33:42,910 --> 02:33:45,340
Yeah, no, there's something, I don't
know if my own experience, and this,

2563
02:33:45,341 --> 02:33:50,341
it's a little embarrassing in a secular
context to talk about this because it,

2564
02:33:50,520 --> 02:33:51,700
it's weird to say,
you know,

2565
02:33:51,730 --> 02:33:56,730
for whatever reason I just fell in
love with the forms and the, and the,

2566
02:33:56,820 --> 02:34:00,300
the ritual and the, you know,
and the, just the feel of it,

2567
02:34:00,310 --> 02:34:03,070
the aesthetic of Buddhism.
I first, for some reason,

2568
02:34:03,071 --> 02:34:06,790
I just immediately felt a sense of
being at home when I went to the first

2569
02:34:06,890 --> 02:34:11,440
meditation retreat and I was there
practicing and I was like, oh wow.

2570
02:34:11,441 --> 02:34:15,190
And I felt this deep sense of
connection with that particular form.

2571
02:34:15,520 --> 02:34:19,690
And for whatever reason, it just
like it for me, it unlocked a lot,

2572
02:34:19,720 --> 02:34:23,890
very rapidly that I don't know that would
have been otherwise possible if I was

2573
02:34:23,891 --> 02:34:28,870
trying to do some sort of practice that
I didn't really connect with that much.

2574
02:34:28,871 --> 02:34:32,830
You know, something about just the love
of the form and the aesthetic itself, uh,

2575
02:34:32,831 --> 02:34:35,650
that I can't really explain except
that I've always liked Asian stuff

2576
02:34:35,750 --> 02:34:40,400
and the inclining of the mind towards,
um, awakenings or awakening, you know,

2577
02:34:40,401 --> 02:34:44,990
that framework and itself
as it's an interesting, um,

2578
02:34:45,140 --> 02:34:48,890
inclination. So, you know, just like
we had search for the holy grail,

2579
02:34:48,891 --> 02:34:50,120
we mentioned that earlier,

2580
02:34:50,210 --> 02:34:54,740
the inclination towards some
kind of inquiry into okay.

2581
02:34:55,370 --> 02:34:58,370
And the question presented itself
earlier, like who, who is, who are we,

2582
02:34:58,371 --> 02:34:59,890
who is this?
Um,

2583
02:34:59,920 --> 02:35:04,370
and I've found that the techniques and
the forms have been really revealing in

2584
02:35:04,371 --> 02:35:05,080
that way.

2585
02:35:05,080 --> 02:35:07,990
The deification of the teachers
are real issue though, right? The,

2586
02:35:08,090 --> 02:35:12,730
they're really does become an issue with
any time any person is the distributor

2587
02:35:13,090 --> 02:35:17,530
of knowledge or information.
They take this position yes.

2588
02:35:17,531 --> 02:35:20,920
And elevated as challenging. And I
think the best teachers, you know,

2589
02:35:20,921 --> 02:35:24,760
we're learning as we become hopefully
a little better as teachers,

2590
02:35:24,761 --> 02:35:29,761
is that the best teachers use that
situation to help people kind of gain a

2591
02:35:30,311 --> 02:35:34,570
confidence in their own
experience and to be able to, um,

2592
02:35:34,720 --> 02:35:38,980
no freedom for themselves
through their own practices.

2593
02:35:38,981 --> 02:35:40,330
Of paying attention,

2594
02:35:40,331 --> 02:35:43,930
of being with things and in that sense
that the best teachers are the ones that

2595
02:35:43,931 --> 02:35:47,800
make themselves irrelevant.
Um, to the best teachers.

2596
02:35:47,830 --> 02:35:50,380
The best teachers make themselves
completely irrelevant I think.

2597
02:35:50,381 --> 02:35:53,680
And process can be empowering in itself.
Yeah.

2598
02:35:54,310 --> 02:35:58,100
Everyone's so calm. Involvement. The,

2599
02:35:58,460 --> 02:36:02,680
did the Buddhist ever get into like death
metal or driving too fast or, oh yeah.

2600
02:36:02,680 --> 02:36:07,280
Racing cars driving too fast. You got,
hold it. There's a whole movement in the,

2601
02:36:07,281 --> 02:36:11,310
in the west of the Dharma punks, which
are Dharma punks, the Dharma punks.

2602
02:36:11,311 --> 02:36:13,360
So who are based here in La. Um, they,

2603
02:36:13,450 --> 02:36:17,380
they were like basically group of folks
that are my friends. They're, yeah,

2604
02:36:17,381 --> 02:36:20,760
they're our friends and uh, you
know, their whole s you know, they,

2605
02:36:20,761 --> 02:36:24,250
they have like major house parties
with huge, you know, music bands.

2606
02:36:24,251 --> 02:36:27,760
And do they do drugs? Um, that
movement? Not really. Well,

2607
02:36:27,761 --> 02:36:31,030
I think a lot of them had done a lot
of drugs and so part of the movement is

2608
02:36:31,031 --> 02:36:35,680
actually about being able to
be okay without the drugs.

2609
02:36:36,100 --> 02:36:38,890
And I think so that's part of the reason
a lot of people are attracted to that

2610
02:36:38,891 --> 02:36:43,340
movement. What about drinking? Uh,

2611
02:36:43,720 --> 02:36:48,190
we drink. Yeah. I had a glass of wine
a little bit. Or did you get hammered?

2612
02:36:48,610 --> 02:36:50,740
I don't really,
I don't get hammered.

2613
02:36:51,010 --> 02:36:53,500
So if someone's at the bar
and they pass your shot shots

2614
02:36:53,530 --> 02:36:56,620
don't like it. Don't like the
feeling. Yeah. It doesn't feel good.

2615
02:36:56,650 --> 02:36:59,460
I feel like crap afterwards.
Definitely afterwards. Yeah.

2616
02:36:59,590 --> 02:37:02,110
It's not the afterwards part.
Like how do you feel before,

2617
02:37:02,111 --> 02:37:04,030
how do you feel daring and
how you feel afterwards?

2618
02:37:04,031 --> 02:37:08,080
Like if I take the average of that, I
don't feel very good, so I don't tend to,

2619
02:37:08,650 --> 02:37:10,420
yeah,
that's personally don't tend to

2620
02:37:10,570 --> 02:37:13,930
boot. Koski uh, used to
get upset at stoners.

2621
02:37:13,960 --> 02:37:16,160
Duncan and I were talking about
this last night because they didn't

2622
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:20,210
have to pay for the experience.
They didn't have the hangover.

2623
02:37:20,500 --> 02:37:25,500
The boot cows be Bukovsky felt like you
earned your drunk with the hangover.

2624
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:27,080
You know,
he'd love that.

2625
02:37:27,500 --> 02:37:30,490
He loves the earth.
There's a hangover from being stoned.

2626
02:37:30,491 --> 02:37:34,570
It's just a little more subtle really.
You feel like that? Yeah, sure.

2627
02:37:34,840 --> 02:37:37,630
What do you feel like the hangover for
being stoned is? I don't feel it at all.

2628
02:37:37,670 --> 02:37:39,680
It's a,
it's a quality of,

2629
02:37:39,681 --> 02:37:44,681
of kind of a little bit slugginess of
the mind and have an increase in self

2630
02:37:45,020 --> 02:37:50,020
referencing talk for me like of of like
more like subtle fear and anxiety and

2631
02:37:51,230 --> 02:37:56,070
self preoccupation. Um, that's
what I've noticed in Wa.

2632
02:37:56,600 --> 02:37:58,160
That's fascinating.
Like in what way?

2633
02:37:59,450 --> 02:38:03,230
In in the sense that I described like,
you know,

2634
02:38:03,420 --> 02:38:06,560
after I've smoked marijuana,
like during its, you know,

2635
02:38:06,561 --> 02:38:08,750
it's an insightful opening experience,

2636
02:38:08,751 --> 02:38:13,370
but after there's a sense of kind of being
groggy and sludgy and like everything

2637
02:38:13,371 --> 02:38:18,230
is like less clear and less open than
before. And so there's a quality of,

2638
02:38:18,260 --> 02:38:22,130
of kind of like s like contraction
that comes after the expansion.

2639
02:38:22,400 --> 02:38:25,640
So that's what I would describe it.
It's a, it's like a mental contraction.

2640
02:38:25,840 --> 02:38:30,500
The headaches and the, no, it's not
as physical as alcohol. Do you guys

2641
02:38:30,580 --> 02:38:32,680
getting that North Carolina Week?
That's what's going on.

2642
02:38:32,681 --> 02:38:34,030
You've got to get some California weed.

2643
02:38:34,910 --> 02:38:38,550
Well you remember we lived in boulder,
so sativas right.

2644
02:38:38,920 --> 02:38:42,840
Oh you remember we lived in
Boulder, so we, we've, we've
tried all varieties. Yeah,

2645
02:38:42,870 --> 02:38:47,250
I'm sure. Maybe it's a physical thing
though. I don't experience that.

2646
02:38:48,150 --> 02:38:51,570
Maybe it's the mental training that we've
done and being a little more sensitive

2647
02:38:51,571 --> 02:38:52,080
to that.
I don't know.

2648
02:38:52,080 --> 02:38:56,370
No, I don't know. But I don't get sludgy
afterwards. There's no sludge. Enos.

2649
02:38:56,830 --> 02:38:59,500
Yeah. It could be personal
differences, but that's also

2650
02:38:59,610 --> 02:39:00,150
Endeca.

2651
02:39:00,150 --> 02:39:05,150
There's a just a job that which
is a wide margin by a wide margin.

2652
02:39:05,521 --> 02:39:08,850
The majority of what most people
are getting, it's easier to grow.

2653
02:39:08,851 --> 02:39:12,360
It's more more common and it's what
a lot of people are looking for.

2654
02:39:12,361 --> 02:39:14,130
It's got the more that narcotic effect,

2655
02:39:14,490 --> 02:39:19,320
whereas the sativas have more of
like an uplifting different sort of,

2656
02:39:19,321 --> 02:39:23,910
uh, and then there's also the eating of
it, which is much more introspective.

2657
02:39:24,060 --> 02:39:26,880
That turning much more cycle.
Much more psychedelic.

2658
02:39:26,970 --> 02:39:28,530
That's right. Yeah. I mean,

2659
02:39:28,531 --> 02:39:32,220
so personally I don't have anything
against a mind altering substances.

2660
02:39:32,221 --> 02:39:34,590
I think meditation is a
mind altering substance.

2661
02:39:35,130 --> 02:39:38,220
I'm more just curious about like
how do we use the substances?

2662
02:39:38,221 --> 02:39:41,220
Are we trying to get
away from our experience?

2663
02:39:41,221 --> 02:39:43,680
Are we trying to have insights every,
are we trying,

2664
02:39:43,700 --> 02:39:47,900
because the problem with
so many substances, you get
into a pattern of, of, of,

2665
02:39:48,260 --> 02:39:51,780
of really trying to cope with the
difficulty of experience and then getting

2666
02:39:51,781 --> 02:39:54,630
addicted to that state
as a way of dealing.

2667
02:39:55,070 --> 02:39:58,440
And I think that's where the problem
comes in from a kind of mind training and

2668
02:39:58,441 --> 02:39:59,840
contemplative perspective is like

2669
02:40:00,020 --> 02:40:02,870
that's a good way to describe it because
that is what sort of happens, right?

2670
02:40:02,930 --> 02:40:06,100
That's, that's why people get drunk.
That's why people do pills. Yeah.

2671
02:40:06,150 --> 02:40:07,850
It's like this,
this existence,

2672
02:40:07,910 --> 02:40:12,910
it's so confusing in itself that you just
want to escape and then you escape and

2673
02:40:13,261 --> 02:40:14,340
that escape becomes

2674
02:40:14,340 --> 02:40:18,000
a trap and you get locked in. Then you
have to keep getting the same thing.

2675
02:40:18,150 --> 02:40:21,420
Try it. If you stop, then you got to
deal with all this shit that comes up.

2676
02:40:21,440 --> 02:40:23,100
It doesn't feel good.
Yeah.

2677
02:40:23,101 --> 02:40:27,660
And then you got to go to Rehab and
try to wean your body off the escape.

2678
02:40:28,090 --> 02:40:29,260
And if you're a Buddhist teacher,

2679
02:40:29,261 --> 02:40:32,320
you got to be concerned about how
everyone perceives you because you're not

2680
02:40:32,321 --> 02:40:32,700
perfect.

2681
02:40:32,700 --> 02:40:34,640
It's cause you're all pilled
up. That's right. Yeah.

2682
02:40:34,650 --> 02:40:36,210
You can't have a pilled
up Buddhist teacher.

2683
02:40:36,360 --> 02:40:38,700
Is there any Buddhist teachers
that are all fucked up on Adderall?

2684
02:40:39,110 --> 02:40:40,690
Uh,
oh there,

2685
02:40:41,850 --> 02:40:45,410
there as many Buddhist teachers doing
as many weird things as there are

2686
02:40:45,480 --> 02:40:46,920
any other humans I'm pretty sure.

2687
02:40:47,670 --> 02:40:52,530
But wouldn't you hope that
at least overall there'd be
more improvement in their

2688
02:40:52,531 --> 02:40:55,950
overall character or ability
to cope with this existence?

2689
02:40:56,140 --> 02:40:58,030
I think there is overall,

2690
02:40:58,031 --> 02:41:02,800
I think people inclined towards openness
and then there's a balance between,

2691
02:41:02,830 --> 02:41:05,800
you know, the multiple levels
of development. I don't know,

2692
02:41:07,330 --> 02:41:11,440
meaning that, you know, just because
we develop and spiritual context.

2693
02:41:11,470 --> 02:41:15,340
Then you also have, you know,
your social context and um,

2694
02:41:15,730 --> 02:41:20,080
so we have to continue to develop evenly,

2695
02:41:20,410 --> 02:41:21,280
you know?
Yeah.

2696
02:41:21,990 --> 02:41:25,050
I think that's one of the trickiest
paradox is like you can become really good

2697
02:41:25,051 --> 02:41:28,830
at being in this free,
liberated, open, spacious mind.

2698
02:41:29,280 --> 02:41:32,160
Some people are incredibly good at it
and you'd just with them and you have a

2699
02:41:32,161 --> 02:41:36,900
hit of that, you know? But like their
sex life is completely messed up,

2700
02:41:37,380 --> 02:41:42,060
you know, and they like abuse
small dogs and children. And
really, I mean, I'm, I'm,

2701
02:41:42,061 --> 02:41:44,400
I'm a, I'm exaggerating a little
bit, not that much. I mean,

2702
02:41:44,401 --> 02:41:46,200
there are people who have had profound,

2703
02:41:46,201 --> 02:41:50,400
profound realizations of the
interconnection of all things and they're

2704
02:41:50,430 --> 02:41:52,620
profoundly dysfunctional and other levels.

2705
02:41:52,860 --> 02:41:54,990
And I've met many of
those folks and have been,

2706
02:41:55,050 --> 02:41:58,740
does folks at times you have
been those folks? Oh yeah.

2707
02:41:58,741 --> 02:42:02,190
I've been dysfunctional and you know,
messed up and doing stupid stuff

2708
02:42:02,570 --> 02:42:04,520
while you were practicing Buddhism.
Sure.

2709
02:42:04,700 --> 02:42:08,300
What was the influence that caused
you to be dysfunctional and fucked up

2710
02:42:08,380 --> 02:42:11,070
while your parents? Usually my,
the insights that have come from

2711
02:42:11,120 --> 02:42:15,020
Buddhism that direction.
So the insights that have,

2712
02:42:15,080 --> 02:42:18,800
they stabilized me really sure.
Sort of like a,

2713
02:42:18,801 --> 02:42:21,620
a psychedelic experience can
make someone go crazy permanently

2714
02:42:22,040 --> 02:42:26,010
or temporarily. Yeah, I think I've,
I've, I've gone through periods. I,

2715
02:42:26,360 --> 02:42:27,890
I'd say less.

2716
02:42:27,910 --> 02:42:32,630
It's been less the Buddhist meditation
as much as it's been like healing just

2717
02:42:32,690 --> 02:42:37,100
parts of my past, you know, being a human
and having been through difficult times,

2718
02:42:37,580 --> 02:42:40,850
you know, I think more of it's
probably been psychological.

2719
02:42:41,390 --> 02:42:43,340
And one of the common things that happens,
you know,

2720
02:42:43,341 --> 02:42:47,450
in a spiritual context is that people
use their spiritual practice to bypass

2721
02:42:47,451 --> 02:42:52,190
those human psychological issues.
It's called spiritual bypassing.

2722
02:42:52,850 --> 02:42:53,690
Um,
so for me,

2723
02:42:53,691 --> 02:42:57,800
I think part of what happened
is I bypassed for a long
time and rent really deep

2724
02:42:57,801 --> 02:43:02,240
in a particular way and then had to come
back around and deal with like my human

2725
02:43:02,241 --> 02:43:05,570
experience, uh, on, on a level
that I hadn't wanted to before.

2726
02:43:05,810 --> 02:43:06,830
And then it was really painful.

2727
02:43:06,950 --> 02:43:11,950
So it's almost like you have these sort
of confining aspects of your personality

2728
02:43:12,580 --> 02:43:15,070
that because of your perceptions,

2729
02:43:15,250 --> 02:43:18,040
those can finding aspects
are probably good.

2730
02:43:18,310 --> 02:43:21,910
And then Buddhism comes along and blows
down those boundaries and you're like,

2731
02:43:21,911 --> 02:43:23,260
I'm not ready for those yet.

2732
02:43:23,620 --> 02:43:25,960
And then you freak out for a little
bit and then you come back around.

2733
02:43:26,140 --> 02:43:26,690
Yeah.
Yeah.

2734
02:43:26,690 --> 02:43:30,140
And then the integration part I think is
kind of what you're talking about too,

2735
02:43:30,141 --> 02:43:33,170
is,
is going deep in the contemplative space.

2736
02:43:33,171 --> 02:43:35,740
And then if we're inclining
our minds towards, you know,

2737
02:43:35,810 --> 02:43:38,360
seeing the reality of like,
what's really happening here?

2738
02:43:38,361 --> 02:43:40,340
Like how are we constructing this reality?

2739
02:43:40,850 --> 02:43:44,960
And that starts to peel back. You know,
there are moments where it's like,

2740
02:43:44,961 --> 02:43:49,040
so there's a lot of freedom. And then
at the same time it's like, oh crap.

2741
02:43:49,070 --> 02:43:53,120
Like I got to figure out how to integrate
this in my life. And maybe that,

2742
02:43:53,300 --> 02:43:56,990
those insights of the vastness and
the spaciousness and that, you know,

2743
02:43:56,991 --> 02:44:01,130
we're not just our bodies and we're not
just our limited views of who we are.

2744
02:44:02,900 --> 02:44:03,381
You know,

2745
02:44:03,381 --> 02:44:06,860
those insights have to be integrated
into the way that we live our life.

2746
02:44:07,340 --> 02:44:09,800
And that's the challenging
part. That's when, you know,

2747
02:44:09,890 --> 02:44:14,150
the rubber meets the road
and, um, that, you know,

2748
02:44:14,151 --> 02:44:18,680
take psychological work. It takes
bodywork. It takes really, it's humbling.

2749
02:44:18,681 --> 02:44:21,950
It's very humbling because then at the
putting the teacher on the pedestal,

2750
02:44:21,980 --> 02:44:26,960
going back to that, it's like, oh, okay,
we're actually all in this together.

2751
02:44:26,990 --> 02:44:30,230
And you know, maybe, you
know, I've traveled these,

2752
02:44:30,410 --> 02:44:33,890
these entire worlds and can
help other people navigate them.

2753
02:44:34,190 --> 02:44:39,080
And at the same time, you know, we have to
come back as a collective and, and like,

2754
02:44:39,110 --> 02:44:40,460
you know what?
You got to wash the dishes.

2755
02:44:40,461 --> 02:44:42,350
He's got to take out the trash and then,
you know,

2756
02:44:42,351 --> 02:44:45,380
if you have kids you got
to raise the kids and um,

2757
02:44:45,440 --> 02:44:49,390
and how do you do that without, without
killing each other, you know? So

2758
02:44:50,080 --> 02:44:51,460
as more of our teachers,

2759
02:44:51,490 --> 02:44:55,600
Jack Kornfield says often you have to
remember your Buddha nature and your zip

2760
02:44:55,601 --> 02:45:00,601
code both and Ryan and the zip code
part I think can be hard if you've been

2761
02:45:01,301 --> 02:45:03,520
focusing mostly on,
on recognizing your,

2762
02:45:03,580 --> 02:45:07,630
your so called Buddha nature either like
the way that your mind inherently is.

2763
02:45:07,960 --> 02:45:10,630
Yeah. That's similarly disgust
in the psychedelic community.

2764
02:45:10,631 --> 02:45:13,510
Like what's the point in having these
experiences if you can't bring back the

2765
02:45:13,511 --> 02:45:18,360
revelations and enhance your actual
here and now life. Sure. Yeah.

2766
02:45:18,890 --> 02:45:22,670
Really important.
And then when it is integrated,

2767
02:45:22,671 --> 02:45:26,030
like I definitely want to flush this
out just a little bit more so people can

2768
02:45:26,031 --> 02:45:27,380
get the sense of that yes,

2769
02:45:27,381 --> 02:45:31,790
they're really their difficulties
and their beautiful, vast,

2770
02:45:31,791 --> 02:45:34,070
spacious moments.
And then at the same time,

2771
02:45:34,100 --> 02:45:37,220
and even if you don't have any beautiful
Spanish, I'd like vast spacious moments.

2772
02:45:37,221 --> 02:45:40,610
Even this moment in itself as you're
sitting here can be beautiful.

2773
02:45:40,611 --> 02:45:43,890
We've all touched into that.
You know, so it's like it,

2774
02:45:44,790 --> 02:45:47,900
there's a sense that when it's a
wearing out, that's how I describe it.

2775
02:45:47,901 --> 02:45:52,190
It's a wearing out process of
a smaller sense of who we are.

2776
02:45:53,420 --> 02:45:58,280
And that integration
process is not always easy.

2777
02:45:58,340 --> 02:46:03,320
And yet as it happens overall
and over the long run,

2778
02:46:03,710 --> 02:46:08,300
we are very, very, very
beautiful people. You know,

2779
02:46:08,301 --> 02:46:09,980
like there's that capacity to be

2780
02:46:09,980 --> 02:46:13,190
extremely powerful,
extremely beautiful and connected,

2781
02:46:13,191 --> 02:46:16,040
really connected with each
other. Um, and that's,

2782
02:46:16,130 --> 02:46:18,920
that's what inspires me
to talk about all of this.

2783
02:46:19,870 --> 02:46:22,640
So you, in a sense, you guys are
kind of Buddhist evangelists.

2784
02:46:23,660 --> 02:46:25,730
That's part of what you're doing.
Like in,

2785
02:46:25,930 --> 02:46:30,470
in the podcast you sort of
explaining or expressing,

2786
02:46:30,800 --> 02:46:32,420
how has this enhanced your life?

2787
02:46:33,420 --> 02:46:36,890
This is one way. It's, yeah, it's one,
it's one way to do it. I mean we're,

2788
02:46:36,900 --> 02:46:40,200
we're not evangelists in the,
in the sort of like missionary sense.

2789
02:46:40,201 --> 02:46:43,590
I think we're evangelist in
the sense that, you know,

2790
02:46:43,591 --> 02:46:45,690
we think there's value
here for some people,

2791
02:46:46,080 --> 02:46:50,040
for some of the time that are inclined
toward this or find it attractive.

2792
02:46:50,490 --> 02:46:53,130
And if they do, like we have, you know,

2793
02:46:53,160 --> 02:46:56,130
it's useful to be able to
connect with other folks who've,

2794
02:46:56,131 --> 02:47:00,150
who've done it and who in some sense
can, you know, can be there with you.

2795
02:47:00,180 --> 02:47:03,360
One of our, uh, one of our
mentors said, you know,

2796
02:47:03,390 --> 02:47:07,920
the role of a teacher is to be just a
little less afraid than the student.

2797
02:47:08,540 --> 02:47:10,890
Um, doesn't mean they're like,
have it completely figured out.

2798
02:47:10,891 --> 02:47:13,650
It just means they have a little
bit less fear of what's happening.

2799
02:47:14,070 --> 02:47:17,160
So I think it's useful to
connect with people like that.

2800
02:47:17,160 --> 02:47:18,990
If you find you're attracted
to something like that.

2801
02:47:18,991 --> 02:47:23,010
Like if you're in to psychedelics,
um, we've, we've explored
psychedelics, you know,

2802
02:47:23,011 --> 02:47:27,930
it's useful to go work with people who
know a bit about it and who can like, um,

2803
02:47:27,960 --> 02:47:32,550
not freak out if you have a bad trip
or if you start losing your, your mind,

2804
02:47:32,820 --> 02:47:33,061
you know,

2805
02:47:33,061 --> 02:47:38,061
that can like extend their stability to
you so that you can actually go through

2806
02:47:38,761 --> 02:47:41,940
that process and learn from it.
And in the end,

2807
02:47:41,941 --> 02:47:44,730
like have an empowering experience of it.
Uh,

2808
02:47:44,820 --> 02:47:48,570
or at least in an empowering like
interpretation of what happened. Um,

2809
02:47:48,760 --> 02:47:52,500
and instead of just feeling like, oh
my God, let reality sucks and like,

2810
02:47:52,501 --> 02:47:56,140
I'm just going to be depressed and, you
know, kind of crawl into a hole. Um,

2811
02:47:56,160 --> 02:47:58,380
so I think, you know, in the
same way, you know, for us,

2812
02:47:58,381 --> 02:48:01,710
we just want to create a space
where people can, um, you know,

2813
02:48:01,711 --> 02:48:04,920
practice together like, like they've
been doing for thousands of years,

2814
02:48:04,921 --> 02:48:08,040
sitting in exploring their minds in a,
in a collective,

2815
02:48:08,530 --> 02:48:11,800
well, I think you two are the comments
people I've ever had in the podcast.

2816
02:48:12,820 --> 02:48:17,740
This has been like the calmest
podcast ever. And, uh, I think, yeah,

2817
02:48:17,741 --> 02:48:21,640
in that sense, you guys are excellent
representations of the Buddhist lifestyle,

2818
02:48:22,060 --> 02:48:25,090
right? Cause that's what it's
all about, right? Being at peace,

2819
02:48:25,720 --> 02:48:29,290
sometimes being chilled sometimes,
unless you're a Dharma punk,

2820
02:48:30,760 --> 02:48:34,540
unless it, unless you're driving
up the four oh five, five o'clock,

2821
02:48:35,530 --> 02:48:38,530
that'll do it to you. That'll
definitely do it to you. Um,
