1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,680
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,170
I don't know if you'd call it a no.

3
00:00:03,171 --> 00:00:04,590
Tropic nootropic.

4
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:05,643
How do you say it?

5
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,570
Nutropenia Yeah,

6
00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:07,404
new tropics.

7
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,510
It does say on the thing,

8
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:09,841
you know,

9
00:00:09,841 --> 00:00:11,850
helps focus and I have to agree.

10
00:00:11,851 --> 00:00:12,690
It really does.

11
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,450
You try this new tropic formula
that we've come out with.

12
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:16,321
We're a,

13
00:00:16,321 --> 00:00:19,520
we're finalizing it and they'd just
finished the formula that this guy,

14
00:00:19,521 --> 00:00:20,311
Chris Markus,

15
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:21,240
have you tried any of it?

16
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:21,900
You've been trying to,

17
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,150
I'm done with my supply.

18
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,000
This,

19
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,430
this shit gives you the most fucked up,

20
00:00:26,431 --> 00:00:27,390
vivid dreams.

21
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,433
However,

22
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,480
I'm going to get you some last night.

23
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:31,343
Here's my dream.

24
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:31,770
My,

25
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,030
the House that I grew up in,

26
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,620
Arnold Swartzman Negar lives in it,

27
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,080
but it's not the house I grew up in.

28
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:41,640
It's some weird house that's on the
rocks right in front of water that

29
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:43,620
apparently is semi-public.

30
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,540
So Arnold Schwarzenegger is living
there now and he's like swimming around.

31
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,860
But all these people are staring
at him because of his situation.

32
00:00:52,861 --> 00:00:54,750
And because you know it is scandal,

33
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,090
but he doesn't give a fuck.

34
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,410
Not only is he not give a fuck,

35
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,990
but he's in really good
shape now in my dream.

36
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,050
And he keeps wanting to pull
his balls out and now he's,

37
00:01:05,051 --> 00:01:06,060
he pulled his balls out,

38
00:01:06,061 --> 00:01:08,220
but he puts his little
bikini underwear on,

39
00:01:08,221 --> 00:01:08,461
like,

40
00:01:08,461 --> 00:01:08,641
you know,

41
00:01:08,641 --> 00:01:09,730
like a Frenchman who would wear.

42
00:01:09,731 --> 00:01:10,350
And I was like,

43
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,700
and he pulls his ball somehow or another
through the back of his underwear and

44
00:01:14,701 --> 00:01:17,370
there where his ass cheeks
are and they're giant.

45
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,790
These giant balls that he has hanging
outside of his underwear by his asshole

46
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,140
because somehow or another that big,

47
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,280
and you know,

48
00:01:26,281 --> 00:01:27,210
he's an old man,

49
00:01:27,211 --> 00:01:32,211
but he looks spectacular and he moves
like with confidence and grace and dives

50
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:33,060
into the water.

51
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:33,510
And I'm like,

52
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,030
I gotta get my wife away
from this motherfucker.

53
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,610
I'm looking at this old crazy man.

54
00:01:38,611 --> 00:01:40,800
Like he's just gonna fuck
every woman within a,

55
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:41,270
um,

56
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,450
a mile radius.

57
00:01:42,451 --> 00:01:43,260
And it's like,

58
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,550
he has no,

59
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,230
no inhibitions,

60
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,180
no,

61
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,330
no worries about it.

62
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,870
And all these people are watching him and
there's a family that's sitting behind

63
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:53,550
this rock and they're like,

64
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:53,761
you know,

65
00:01:53,761 --> 00:01:53,971
there's,

66
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:56,880
they're sitting there watching
Arnold moving around swimming.

67
00:01:56,881 --> 00:01:58,170
It keeps taking his pants off.

68
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,870
He keeps taking his bikini
bottoms off and like washing.

69
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:02,443
But

70
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,231
whatever it is,

71
00:02:04,231 --> 00:02:05,750
it's some crazy what,

72
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:06,750
I don't know what it is.

73
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,080
I mean,

74
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,840
Freud would have a fucking
field day with this chair.

75
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,261
Like,

76
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:12,090
what is this dream supposed to represent?

77
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:12,370
Well,

78
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,010
am I terrified of Arnold Sports?

79
00:02:14,011 --> 00:02:16,860
And that would loved to have seen your
face while dreaming and just like the

80
00:02:16,861 --> 00:02:20,610
little flinches and you're faced with
it whether they were a violence or fear,

81
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,710
you have to look at it like this.

82
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:23,130
I,

83
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:27,400
they say one way to analyze dreams as
you look at every part of a dream is a

84
00:02:27,401 --> 00:02:29,580
projection of some aspect of your life.

85
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,380
So Arnold Schwarzenegger,

86
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,970
isn't that your ed?

87
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,310
Isn't that your lower primal south?

88
00:02:35,311 --> 00:02:36,900
Some kind of like that.

89
00:02:36,901 --> 00:02:37,691
That would be that,

90
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:37,970
that,

91
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:38,780
that dry,

92
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,410
that the sex drive,

93
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:43,230
the like that drive the power drive.

94
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,180
So you're kind of vanity drive,

95
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:45,491
you know,

96
00:02:45,491 --> 00:02:48,930
looking at he's a bodybuilder that
it's like the most vain thing you could

97
00:02:48,931 --> 00:02:49,710
possibly do.

98
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,000
And then the public ocean,

99
00:02:51,001 --> 00:02:51,511
you could say,

100
00:02:51,511 --> 00:02:52,590
well the public ocean,

101
00:02:52,591 --> 00:02:53,251
that's your,

102
00:02:53,251 --> 00:02:53,910
um,

103
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:58,050
is that your public life is that you're
doing the podcast and you kind of have

104
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,820
like have all your shit in
front of everyone on the planet.

105
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:06,060
And so you're seeing like a projection
of your ed swimming through or reacting

106
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:07,181
to,

107
00:03:07,181 --> 00:03:07,931
like you're thinking,

108
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:09,660
I'm thinking about all sorts of negatives.

109
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,533
Yeah,

110
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,170
we talked about yesterday.

111
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:12,410
No,

112
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:13,930
I don't think it's me.

113
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,700
I don't think that represents me.

114
00:03:15,701 --> 00:03:16,990
I see where you're going with that.

115
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:17,824
But no,

116
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,610
because what this guy
represents to me now,

117
00:03:21,611 --> 00:03:25,310
when I found out that he fucked his maid
and his shot loads and it was made in

118
00:03:25,311 --> 00:03:25,391
that,

119
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:26,710
apparently he was doing
it for a long time.

120
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,920
What he represents to me is like this
almost like unbridled hedonist that

121
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:34,660
regardless of the stakes of,

122
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,200
you know,

123
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,900
of whatever fucked up thing
that he does sexually.

124
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,550
Now he's the governor,

125
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,410
he's a giant movie star,

126
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:44,200
multimillionaire married to a Kennedy,

127
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:44,981
basically.

128
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:45,850
Shriver's.

129
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,900
She's some sort of a Kennedy,

130
00:03:46,901 --> 00:03:47,230
right?

131
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:47,920
Yeah.

132
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,440
He know into this respectable family,

133
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,870
but yet banging maids,

134
00:03:52,871 --> 00:03:55,210
fucking all sorts of
checks all over the planet.

135
00:03:55,211 --> 00:03:57,880
I'm sure he just never pulled it back,

136
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:58,540
you know?

137
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,260
And that's,

138
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,730
that to me is amazing.

139
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,270
And what's,

140
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,370
there's something about it in,

141
00:04:02,371 --> 00:04:03,220
in my dream,

142
00:04:03,221 --> 00:04:05,440
he was just completely without,

143
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,940
without remorse.

144
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:07,930
Within my dream.

145
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:08,800
He was owning it.

146
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,701
In my dream,

147
00:04:09,701 --> 00:04:10,121
he was,

148
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:10,331
you know,

149
00:04:10,331 --> 00:04:10,961
this is me.

150
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:12,260
I'm this crazy freak.

151
00:04:12,261 --> 00:04:13,094
I'm out here.

152
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,280
I bay the UC my balls,

153
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,061
you know what I mean?

154
00:04:16,061 --> 00:04:20,290
That was who he was in my dream was
smiling and laughing and waving to people

155
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,520
and he didn't give a fuck,

156
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,391
you know,

157
00:04:22,391 --> 00:04:23,224
but in real life,

158
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:23,381
I mean,

159
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:25,150
the poor guy fallen apart in real life.

160
00:04:25,151 --> 00:04:26,470
He's a 60 year old man,

161
00:04:26,471 --> 00:04:27,640
kicked out of his house,

162
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:28,420
you know,

163
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,620
and his family knows,

164
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:29,950
he,

165
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:30,120
he,

166
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,431
you know,

167
00:04:30,431 --> 00:04:33,700
he had a child literally
two weeks apart from the,

168
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:35,740
his own child with the maid,

169
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,450
the maid that was there
made for 20 fucking years.

170
00:04:38,451 --> 00:04:39,550
Do you think you'll survive all this?

171
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,210
I know you will.

172
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:40,840
No,

173
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,170
no.

174
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:41,770
That's a wrap.

175
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:41,950
You,

176
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:42,790
you see what you think?

177
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,380
Like if you made a termino
fought fire right now,

178
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,390
Don people are done with him.

179
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,430
How could he do this?

180
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,720
Is this is this is what I think.

181
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:48,911
I mean,

182
00:04:48,911 --> 00:04:49,571
it's possible.

183
00:04:49,571 --> 00:04:50,291
Anything can happen.

184
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,610
I might be just talking out of my ass.

185
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,800

186
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:01,390
