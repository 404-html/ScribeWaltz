1
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:04,370
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,500
[inaudible]

3
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:16,860
pros,

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:17,760
professional players,

5
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:21,391
what do you have to learn?

6
00:00:21,391 --> 00:00:22,224
Like what are the principles?

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:22,441
Well,

8
00:00:22,441 --> 00:00:23,910
you can learn the fundamentals,

9
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:29,070
like how to kind of stand
the right way to hit a ball.

10
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,860
But learning how to do things,

11
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:35,790
we'll look all like learning
how to move the ball correctly.

12
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,650
Like shot like this.

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,390
Most people have no idea where I'm going
to get from there to the four ball.

14
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:43,590
So I want to get out of here.

15
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,220
You have to hit the four bolts,

16
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:45,871
the four balls,

17
00:00:45,871 --> 00:00:46,704
next

18
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,440
three after three.

19
00:00:49,441 --> 00:00:50,820
I've got to get into
position for the forest.

20
00:00:50,821 --> 00:00:52,740
So I hit it flat so it slides out.

21
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:00,060
And so I don't just do that,

22
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:04,120
but I also took a steamer.

23
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,143
Um,

24
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,300
but like now when I make a shot,

25
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,340
I always am setting myself
up for the next shot.

26
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,200
So everything's about angles.

27
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,034
It's all geometry.

28
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,050
It's all about you don't
want to be over here.

29
00:01:19,051 --> 00:01:22,890
You want to be able to hear because the
natural progression is here to slide

30
00:01:22,891 --> 00:01:23,970
down here for this ball.

31
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,110
So when I hit this ball,

32
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,050
you're going to hit that
pink ball into that pocket.

33
00:01:28,051 --> 00:01:28,640
Right.

34
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,380
So,

35
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,260
so now I'm not thinking about that.

36
00:01:31,261 --> 00:01:32,094
That's easy.

37
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,630
What's important is getting in a good
position for this ball and just speaking,

38
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,170
you got to hit that ball there.

39
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,390
Right there around there,

40
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:39,820
right?

41
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,870
Well I have to hit it exactly right
here because that's the only way you're

42
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:44,704
gonna make it.

43
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,300
And then you draw a line
to where the ball is.

44
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:47,890
Where the book,

45
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:48,671
well there's a lot of,

46
00:01:48,671 --> 00:01:52,090
it's instinctive cause I understand where
the contact point is and I'm going to

47
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,110
hit it with English.

48
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:59,230
Which puts are the 10 side you went
with was lefthand English on it.

49
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:00,743
Spinach.

50
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,380
Okay.

51
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,210
Oh and we're dessert.

52
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:06,643
Bananas.

53
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:06,981
Yeah.

54
00:02:06,981 --> 00:02:08,000
What the fuck is that?

55
00:02:08,001 --> 00:02:09,070
See how the shots I can,

56
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,303
wow.

57
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,380
What are you going to do now?

58
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,330
I'm going to talk at that
and get in position this.

59
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,050
Yup.

60
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:16,500
Talking about,

61
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,301
and that corner could that,

62
00:02:17,301 --> 00:02:17,601
that's,

63
00:02:17,601 --> 00:02:18,434
that feels like it's,

64
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,100
but the most important thing
is getting out of here.

65
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,680
It's about getting out of
here for the side pocket.

66
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,210
How the fuck because no,

67
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,760
you'd have to hit it just wipes on.

68
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,170
That's a hard stock season.

69
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,060
This is what's important getting here,

70
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,410
but not just here but down people.

71
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,740
Cause I gotta go back up to the seven.

72
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,310
Can't be updatable because
then you've got to do all this.

73
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,560
Now you want to hit that,

74
00:02:47,561 --> 00:02:49,620
that white ball you want
to get in position where,

75
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,730
where do you want to stop them ball.

76
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,400
So I want to make sure that I
have an angle on a seven ball.

77
00:02:53,401 --> 00:02:58,401
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna hit
it low and just slide north says lie.

78
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,950
That's impressive.

79
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:03,784
Look at that.

80
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,930
So now from here,

81
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:05,970
this is for easy.

82
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,800
My only concern is I don't
get stuck behind the 10 ball.

83
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,330
I get stuck behind a 10 ball,

84
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,890
then I don't have a shot at the eight.

85
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:15,460
So I want to play towards the danger zone,

86
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:16,870
which is like this side rail.

87
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:18,950
So I don't want to a,

88
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:19,960
I don't want to scratch,

89
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,970
but I don't want to get stuck behind 10

90
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,360
see how close I am?

91
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,830
Ooh Myself,

92
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,813
I can't see it.

93
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,200
But I was worried about that.

94
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,090
I really wanted to land like right here,

95
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:34,650
telling them,

96
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,483
perfect.

97
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,840
If I see like that kind of position,

98
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,390
that takes fucking years
to learn how to do,

99
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,463
to learn how,

100
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,920
how hard you're supposed to be hitting
the ball to make it react like that.

101
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,460
If you don't have a,

102
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,330
that kind of pinpoint precision,

103
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,360
that ability to manipulate.

104
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,830
And so pros will run
like two tails at a time.

105
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:57,610
Three to the best guys can throw 10,

106
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:58,271
10,

107
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:58,490
10.

108
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:58,720
Yeah.

109
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,060
Especially in practice when
there's no money on the line,

110
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:01,871
it's just nothing.

111
00:04:01,871 --> 00:04:02,950
They're just having a good time.

112
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:03,780
Yeah.

113
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,040
They can run the fucking
10 racks and crazy shit.

114
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,660
I've run for broken run four
racks in a room of nine ball,

115
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,160
which is way harder than enable

116
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,471
nine bosses.

117
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:15,304
No more money.

118
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:15,791
Well,

119
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,140
nine no nine ball is,

120
00:04:17,141 --> 00:04:17,974
um,

121
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:18,970
is a rotation game.

122
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,800
April you have a bunch
of different choices.

123
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,280
You can choose to shoot any
color or any solid or any stripe,

124
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:27,154
whether any solid,

125
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,340
but whereas in a nine
ball playing a rotation,

126
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:31,330
so every shot,

127
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,680
there's no options.

128
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,100
Salads or stripes.

129
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,450
You're nine ball is
you're shooting the balls,

130
00:04:40,451 --> 00:04:41,590
one through nine,

131
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:42,371
one,

132
00:04:42,371 --> 00:04:42,731
two,

133
00:04:42,731 --> 00:04:43,091
three,

134
00:04:43,091 --> 00:04:43,391
four,

135
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:43,721
five,

136
00:04:43,721 --> 00:04:43,991
six,

137
00:04:43,991 --> 00:04:44,381
seven,

138
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:44,651
eight,

139
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,180
nine you get the nine you went.

140
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,760
Whereas with a eight ball,

141
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:49,951
you're either saw,

142
00:04:49,951 --> 00:04:52,180
odds are stripes and you'd
get a lot more options.

143
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:53,260
You can pick your shots.

144
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,300
It's still a very tough game,

145
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,500
but it's not nearly,

146
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,420
it doesn't require much
ability to move the two ball.

147
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:05,980
It's all about moving the cue ball.

148
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,620
Snick the last shot.

149
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,010
This is a crazy table too.

150
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,410
This isn't a regular table.

151
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:18,100
Like look,

152
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,600
it doesn't even fit two balls in him.

153
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:20,611
Is it?

154
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:20,861
Very,

155
00:05:20,861 --> 00:05:21,730
very tight table.

156
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,620
So this is a protein much anymore.

157
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:24,360
It's more tight.

158
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,010
Dynapro table pro tables,

159
00:05:26,011 --> 00:05:27,010
four and a half inches.

160
00:05:27,011 --> 00:05:28,560
This table for practice.

161
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,710
Yeah.

162
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,980
Well it's like a table or
for people that you know,

163
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,720
you don't want to any bullshit.

164
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,150
You don't want a ball to Bible in,

165
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,160
you know?

166
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,650
And if you didn't pick up golf,

167
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,890
you would have never been scared.

168
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:42,763
Scared.

169
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,410
I saw too many people can.

170
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,820
We saw too many people that picked
up golf and then became fucking nuts.

171
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,440
They would just play all day.

172
00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:51,071
And it takes too much.

173
00:05:51,071 --> 00:05:51,970
You've got down time.

174
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,950
Like you could go play pool for an hour.

175
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,710
You can't play golf for
an hour playing golf.

176
00:05:56,711 --> 00:05:57,680
You're playing all day.

177
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:58,543
Yeah.

178
00:05:58,770 --> 00:05:59,530
It's like that shit.

179
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:03,860
What's the top pool guy
making Dennis a problem dog.

180
00:06:03,861 --> 00:06:04,694
Shit.

181
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,940
Even the number one guy in the world
and no one guy in the world and I made a

182
00:06:07,941 --> 00:06:08,870
quarter million bucks

183
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,130
and there's not that
many of those guys travel

184
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:16,100
silent movies.

185
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,010
So it's not applicable anymore.

186
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:19,660
Oh,

187
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,730
you're going to print something and
put it out on a fucking piece of paper?

188
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,120
Hadn't they lost whatever,

189
00:06:26,121 --> 00:06:27,470
like remaining respect that happened.

190
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,940
Then I lost when they publish this,

191
00:06:28,941 --> 00:06:29,774
uh,

192
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:30,380
okay.

193
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,600
Article in their magazine or

194
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:38,000
on Angel Wings and it was this like insane
justification for how drones are more

195
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:39,710
humane than other forms of warfare.

196
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,160
And it read like a PRP who paint like
which defense contractor paid for this

197
00:06:46,131 --> 00:06:48,410
bullshit cause it's just totally demented.

198
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:51,670
How's the year to go?

199
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,330
Yeah.

200
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,163
That's um,

201
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:57,240
what would you say is right?

202
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:04,500
It's like you never know what's the
source of the motivation to do a story.

203
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:06,131
You know,

204
00:07:06,131 --> 00:07:11,131
after you hear about Amba lions experience
with CNN and that bar rain piece one

205
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:12,460
earlier,

206
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,600
how much of that are going on?

207
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:18,790
How much of what we're seeing on
television and reading in a newspaper is

208
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:20,620
filtered through propaganda?

209
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,690
Probably quite a bit.

210
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:30,791
Yeah.

211
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,770
I was watching part of
the Kimmel last night.

212
00:07:32,771 --> 00:07:33,640
He had Johnny Depp,

213
00:07:33,641 --> 00:07:36,940
Vaughn sneaky about how
that format is just,

214
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,430
that's what most people are consuming.

215
00:07:39,431 --> 00:07:42,850
And it's so weird because you have
somebody there for five or six minutes.

216
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,760
They don't share anything
that's important,

217
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,020
like you never see.

218
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,770
Even though I think Kim
was the best late night,

219
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:49,870
I do too.

220
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:50,770
You never see like,

221
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:52,840
so Johnny was the meaning of life.

222
00:07:52,841 --> 00:07:55,100
Like what should people
try to do a nice view.

223
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:59,660
It's like meaningless bullshit that
I've already forgotten or hadn't.

224
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,230
He flies back to the south of
France or wherever he's from.

225
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,040
And that's it.

226
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:08,040
Like you to promote his new movie and
you don't learn anything more about what

227
00:08:08,651 --> 00:08:10,540
he believes about the world or politics.

228
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,341
That's a good point.

229
00:08:12,341 --> 00:08:17,341
It's like the whole format was created
before the much better format that we

230
00:08:19,631 --> 00:08:20,270
have now.

231
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,103
Yeah.

232
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,190
And then the whole commercials,

233
00:08:25,191 --> 00:08:25,971
what we're right back.

234
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:27,050
Like where are you going

235
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,920
right there fucking talk to him.

236
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:35,810
Like everyone knows a conversation
sort of ramps up like you have a

237
00:08:35,811 --> 00:08:36,351
conversation,

238
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:39,750
sit down and then you get loose and
after a while and then you start really,

239
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:43,040
and it has a flow to it and that
flows completely interrupted.

240
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,980
If you start doing a
commercial every seven minutes

241
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,411
or whatever it is,

242
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:49,460
we don't wait that format.

243
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:53,190
Campbell does a great job because you
can tell that he's really smart and uh,

244
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,143
I watched her,

245
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:56,670
it's was like,

246
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,430
he's not worried that he's going
to lose his show or something.

247
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:01,243
He's nervous.

248
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:02,400
He's going to go overboard.

249
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:02,471
It,

250
00:09:02,471 --> 00:09:03,720
something's going gonna just take it away.

251
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,800
Really.

252
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,700
That's the feeling I get.

253
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,080
Maybe that's just his personality,

254
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:09,090
but it's like you could go a lot further.

255
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:10,110
You can push things further.

256
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:12,070
You don't have to tell you though.

257
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:12,511
I mean,

258
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:14,010
it's the fucking tonight show.

259
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:15,180
I mean,

260
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,380
I know he's not Jay Leno,

261
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:17,760
but it's still the tonight show.

262
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,040
People watching it now.

263
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,510
Half of them are probably watching
it on youtube the next day.

264
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:23,471
Yeah.

265
00:09:23,471 --> 00:09:27,630
But doing all these things for this
hypothetical old lady in the Midwest is

266
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:32,260
going to be offended by it and I think
we're seeing is like less and less a

267
00:09:32,261 --> 00:09:32,970
reality.

268
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:33,600
They're dying.

269
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,433
Yeah.

270
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,440
Basically another 90 now dynamic.

271
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,470
I think you're right in some ways,

272
00:09:42,471 --> 00:09:45,020
but the bottom line is their,

273
00:09:45,021 --> 00:09:48,110
their revenues directly related to their,

274
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,473
the ratings

275
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:54,350
and so thinking that oh most people
are going to watch it on youtube.

276
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,390
That doesn't translate financially.

277
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:57,703
Yeah.

278
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:02,000
Still that's the main motivation
was still the financial motivation.

279
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,990
I mean they look,

280
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,330
they look at those numbers
where the fund we'll comb,

281
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:07,803
they um,

282
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:14,700
they have talking detailed by the minute
analysis break down and somebody 10,000

283
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:20,500
when Kendall started
talking about tomatoes,

284
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,940
people don't care about tomatoes,

285
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,110
don't talk about tomatoes,

286
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,570
but we dropped off 1%.

287
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,020
You know,

288
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:26,853
when you turn,

289
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,290
you know,

290
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:27,531
they,

291
00:10:27,531 --> 00:10:28,364
they have that,

292
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,820
they have like these
number being countered.

293
00:10:30,821 --> 00:10:31,690
Dude that's good.

294
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,650
Are really concerned about that stuff.

295
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,713
It's weird.

296
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:37,871
It's weird.

297
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:39,390
Did they have that sort of an attitude?

298
00:10:39,391 --> 00:10:43,800
But they do believe in some of the big
youtube channels and friends with the guy

299
00:10:43,801 --> 00:10:47,190
who was the head of production
or it those until recently.

300
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:51,570
And he was telling me that they look at
everything like the number of likes and

301
00:10:51,571 --> 00:10:52,081
dislikes,

302
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:53,230
and if it goes beyond

303
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:59,190
too many reds [inaudible]
they'll just pull the video.

304
00:10:59,280 --> 00:10:59,671
And I was like,

305
00:10:59,671 --> 00:11:00,360
really?

306
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,240
He said they don't want to fuck
up their algorithm or whatever.

307
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,040
They want to continuously be on the top.

308
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:08,280
So the video doesn't do as well as
they expected to just get rid of it.

309
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,880
It's that rarely happens because they
know so well with the audience wants at

310
00:11:11,881 --> 00:11:12,540
this point.

311
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,250
What kind of videos do they make?

312
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,290
They do like music,

313
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,153
entertainment,

314
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,420
two minute long clips,

315
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,340
different discussions and stuff.

316
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,743
Wow.

317
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,793
So that's fine.

318
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:28,280
But to me a long toss is
even more ridiculous when
I'm talking about real stuff.

319
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:28,940
It'll be like,

320
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,000
I need to know about,

321
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,481
you know,

322
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,360
the Harvard or something.

323
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:36,630
[inaudible].
