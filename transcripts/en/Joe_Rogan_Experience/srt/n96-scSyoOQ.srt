1
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,730
Cats don't give a fuck. They don't
give a fuck. My Cat's killer.

2
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,690
Oh Dude. They're ruthless. Ruthless,
ruthless. Just kills everything.

3
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,050
Anything they can.
Yeah.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,790
If you ever seen the numbers for how
many things cats kill in North America?

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,110
No Bill Yin's of birds.
Billions. Billions.

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,940
Billions. Billions of mammals and
billions of birds. So gangsters,

7
00:00:26,941 --> 00:00:30,090
they kill them and don't even eat
them. No, they just kill him. Yeah.

8
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,640
Cause they like the sport.
They're monsters. Yeah.

9
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,780
And just brings him and drops him in
my kids' beds. Like this question,

10
00:00:36,781 --> 00:00:39,210
people also ask to cats,
kill birds.

11
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:43,440
I keep leaving my birds and they're dead.

12
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,680
Fluffy would never do that.
He's a Sweeney.

13
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,840
I didn't see a feather
in his full well there.

14
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,100
You know Mike am I cat drops,
rodents,

15
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,600
all my children's hair while they sleep

16
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,290
in her bed.
Oh my God.

17
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:11,330
Dropped a rat and my daughter's bathroom
leak in her shower cap to mark his

18
00:01:12,841 --> 00:01:15,800
territory. The rat was just
scared shitless and was rather,

19
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,110
we couldn't still alive.

20
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,830
It's like behind the toilet and
stuff and we finally got it out.

21
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:25,130
I might do the next day it goes to put
on a shower cap and it's just filled with

22
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,270
pee,
pee

23
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,620
fucking die from disgusting.

24
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,950
She know that you can get leprosy
from armadillos. No, of course.

25
00:01:37,951 --> 00:01:38,760
I don't know that.
