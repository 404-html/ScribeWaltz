1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,030

00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,230

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,480
Oh that's video games and comic books.

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,960
Well how about we just give
him a little false advertising.

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:44,913
Brian maybe.

13
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,130
Maybe you get more people don't you
know what this country runs on son.

14
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,130
No I'm upset with what's right.

15
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,550
Ryan killed Ryan Kelly.

16
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:58,690
Very very funny and talented Ryan Keeling
and Brian also does a gang of shows

17
00:00:58,881 --> 00:01:03,881
and he's doing some soon in San Francisco
and Sacramento at the punch line in

18
00:01:04,251 --> 00:01:05,210
Sacramento.

19
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,210
And with this man Tony Hinchcliffe
you'll be there as well.

20
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,200
And what were we doing the apples here.

21
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,580
Yeah I was talking about this.

22
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:12,810
Tony.

23
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:13,670
Tony it's because finance.

24
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,130
I was Tony road.

25
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,453
It's great.

26
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,680
He cries when you fuck him.

27
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:18,623
But.

28
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,500
Here here here here.

29
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:26,660
But tell that to legendary comedy clubs
Sam Tripoli as well our boy Sam Tripoli

30
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:30,150
who's one of my very good friends
in comedy for many many years.

31
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,710
He's a fucking beautiful human being I
love that guy and very funny as well.

32
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:38,770
And so they are at Cobb's on Sunday May
5th and May 3rd and 4th they're at the

33
00:01:39,621 --> 00:01:41,150
punch line in Sacramento.

34
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,880
And if you've never been to the punch
line in Sacramento I've never been to a

35
00:01:43,881 --> 00:01:44,750
comedy club.

36
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:49,400
The punch line in Sacramento is like
one of the perfect comedy clubs to go to

37
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,710
because it's been around for ever.

38
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,500
This as well as places like I don't
remember the first time I worked there.

39
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:59,550
But it was well over a decade ago it's a
bad ass old school comedy club and some

40
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,340
great great great comedy has been done
on that stage perfectly set out really

41
00:02:04,341 --> 00:02:05,180
intimate seating.

42
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,880
So it's a bad ass place to
see three very funny guy.

43
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:12,940
So May 3rd and 4th at the punch line in
Sacramento and May 5th at Cobb's and in

44
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,300
San Francisco and there
might be a surprise guest
there might not be though too

45
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:24,340
there might not be may be AIDS get
stronger maybe World War Z is for real but

46
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,330
maybe there's gonna be a big guest maybe
there's a lot a lot of times you can't

47
00:02:29,331 --> 00:02:32,960
say because the reason being I'd say if
you're doing a show like this like we

48
00:02:32,961 --> 00:02:36,740
might have a friend that's in town it
says hey I want to do the show but they

49
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:41,300
don't want to advertise because they
have a committed gig within X amount of

50
00:02:41,301 --> 00:02:44,840
miles with an X amount of months and
sometimes not supposed to say that you're

51
00:02:44,841 --> 00:02:46,510
doing a gig like that's why.

52
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:50,390
Like if you go to like some some guys you
don't have a hard time with the Comedy

53
00:02:50,391 --> 00:02:53,060
Store for putting your name up there
because they would have like a gig they

54
00:02:53,061 --> 00:02:54,980
were doing in a big place
or try to sell tickets for.

55
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,580
So we'd have an arrangement.

56
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:00,200
So that's why I can't say but
it might be someone very funny.

57
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,890
It might be somebody that
hardly ever leaves L.A.

58
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,320
and hardly ever leaves the Comedy Store.

59
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,473
Mm hmm.

60
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,040
Wow this is exciting.

61
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:10,970
I want to know who it is.

62
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:11,390
Okay.

63
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,840
I don't even know who the fuck it is yet.

64
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,113
I think I do.

65
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,320
If if it is I think it is he's awesome.

66
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,400
Yeah they're the comedy stores
that means 80 percent awesome.

67
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,760
You know even the 20 percent mediocre
it's probably better than what you got in

68
00:03:22,761 --> 00:03:23,594
your town anyway.

69
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:24,743
Yeah.

70
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,700
So you're a powerful Ryan Keeley
mob said All right you guys.

71
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,073
We.

72
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,760
This podcast is brought to you by Tang.

73
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:37,300
I'm so glad that when when we we pick up
a podcast sponsor you're always like oh

74
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,150
what if these kinds of douche bags you
know like what if that's like a big fear

75
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:46,240
you know when you take on
a sponsor because you know
I'm on network I don't have

76
00:03:46,461 --> 00:03:51,140
a channel I'm just you know I'm just
doing this thing and I'm trying to like

77
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,300
navigate all this stuff by myself.

78
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:54,643
So

79
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,080
my attitude with the whole thing was
I looked and I said the most important

80
00:04:00,081 --> 00:04:05,081
thing first of all is that I don't feel
duty like whatever we're selling and

81
00:04:06,891 --> 00:04:11,891
everybody's like then it's too
late for you know for brain do she.

82
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,610
You know I just want to make sure that
what we're selling is a good product.

83
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:21,670
So I get all these emails and tweets
tweets especially sometimes about talking

84
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:28,780
about people saying how much money they're
saving on Tang and guy one guy talked

85
00:04:28,881 --> 00:04:29,840
about it a couple of weeks ago.

86
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,423
He wrote to me.

87
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:34,250
He chopped his bill down
from 90 bucks to like 18.

88
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,590
I don't know how the fuck he
did I know what he's doing.

89
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,960
That sound sounded completely outrageous.

90
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,410
Well my bill has been that guy
about twenty five dollars a month.

91
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,800
I mean and I have to say that this is
my second phone and this is you know my

92
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,090
massage parlor phone.

93
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,670
Dan would you say that you use it 50
percent as much as you earlier your other

94
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,990
phone or I'd probably say my other phone
I use it 50 percent more maybe it's

95
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,670
maybe a little bit a little
bit higher maybe 60 maybe six.

96
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:01,790
So probably be the equivalent of sixty
dollars someone like that would you say

97
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:02,090
that.

98
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:02,940
Yeah that makes sense.

99
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:03,760
Yeah.

100
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,410
So if that's still him it's still
cheaper than then what like.

101
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:10,340
Right now I have you know the iPhone
through AT&T as my main phone and that's

102
00:05:10,341 --> 00:05:12,620
about one hundred and twenty
two hundred ten dollars a month.

103
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:12,770
You

104
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,270
know it's fucking very pricey.

105
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,060
Yeah.

106
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,080
What thing does is they first of all they
use the Sprint network then have their

107
00:05:18,081 --> 00:05:22,380
own network these one of the major
networks in this country one that you know

108
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,400
it's it's got 4G it's it's excellent and
they also have the highest level of the

109
00:05:28,731 --> 00:05:33,110
most technologically advanced Android
phones all these new fucking killer

110
00:05:33,111 --> 00:05:38,111
Android phones like the Samsung Galaxy
S3 and the Samsung Galaxy Note They have

111
00:05:38,961 --> 00:05:43,250
the note 2 as well they're fucking
incredibly things he used to be like you

112
00:05:43,251 --> 00:05:46,670
really lost something if you didn't get
an iPhone like you really have you try

113
00:05:46,671 --> 00:05:49,740
to have one of those early
Android they were dog shit.

114
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:54,890
I had the first one was Oh you're so
stupid those things are horrible that and

115
00:05:54,891 --> 00:05:58,240
those BlackBerry touch screens these
to have eyes to have one of those the

116
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,500
BlackBerry Storm.

117
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,780
Yeah fuckin storm of shit.

118
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:09,200
So that was diarrhea and that's stupid
shit bag phone but these SAMs I have the

119
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:14,480
Galaxy S3 it's fucking awesome it's great
it's the coolest thing ever for like

120
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:15,360
looking at websites.

121
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:20,710
It's huge and it's very fast as well like
the processor and it's not like clunky

122
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:22,720
like like the droids of all.

123
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,190
So anyway the waiting has it set up
is they have no contracts so you buy a

124
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:29,460
device set it up and go.

125
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:33,170
You can go fuck yourself you could just
cancel not only that they credit you on

126
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:38,230
unused service if you if you use only
a certain amount of your bill they

127
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:44,170
actually like knock you down to the
next level and your next bill and they

128
00:06:44,391 --> 00:06:49,130
credit you the difference
it's it's beautiful it's
everything you could ask for

129
00:06:49,131 --> 00:06:52,700
from a big company like a company that's
dead I mean they're not one of the

130
00:06:52,701 --> 00:06:53,750
bigger cell phone companies.

131
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,490
I mean how many cell phone companies
are there actually really stop thinking

132
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:02,500
well there's like the big five or whenever
you like T-Mobile Ryan Verizon AT&T

133
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:07,370
it's like you generally thought of it's
like this it's like a rise in powerful

134
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:11,030
AT&T powerful T-Mobile
you're on a budget yeah yeah.

135
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:15,110
Right now it is it's crazy
because T-Mobile as you
know they're new towers are

136
00:07:15,111 --> 00:07:19,460
pretty advanced and they don't have that
fucking you know bandwidth hogs that

137
00:07:19,461 --> 00:07:22,940
you know AT&T and Verizon they're their
bandwidth I mean so many people are on

138
00:07:22,941 --> 00:07:27,170
their network when something goes down
half the people have Verizon or AT&T you

139
00:07:27,171 --> 00:07:29,630
know they're not gonna have cell phone
service but then you have like T-Mobile

140
00:07:29,631 --> 00:07:30,660
guys they're like No I'm fine.

141
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,820
That's a very good point.

142
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:32,840
That's a very good point.

143
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:33,680
Yeah.

144
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,690
And Sprint is a big one.

145
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,340
Joey Diaz That's him forever.

146
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:38,300
He loved it.

147
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,100
I've never had it other than this
but I've got no problems with it.

148
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,280
Yeah and the though the whole idea behind
thing is that they're just going to

149
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:50,360
offer you a service that's you
know it's just it's reasonable.

150
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:55,040
You don't have to get fucked over it
doesn't have to be this idea that we all

151
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,480
think that every company should try to
squeeze every last dollar out of every

152
00:07:59,481 --> 00:08:00,314
last customer.

153
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,610
I think that shit's stupid.

154
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:04,370
I think most people rise
up realizing that as well.

155
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:10,060
So go to Rogan distinction and you can
save yourself twenty five dollars off of

156
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:15,281
either a phone or service from a very
cool company were also brought to you by

157
00:08:15,831 --> 00:08:16,880
square space.

158
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,190
So you have to ask yourself do
you want to make a web site.

159
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,390
Bitch that's my question to you bitch.

160
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,353
Do you want make a web site.

161
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:29,620
And if you do let's get a real
young guy learn no HMO OK.

162
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,920
You're not going to use it.

163
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,890
It's just not gonna happen.

164
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,210
Okay let's be honest.

165
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,163
Another thing

166
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:40,520
you don't need to begin to you to really
learn how to put all that shit in and

167
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:46,660
it's gonna be all fucked up and then
you gonna try to what look at it unlike

168
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,580
Windows Internet Explorer.

169
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:49,650
It's going to shit.

170
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,640
But look it works on safari.

171
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:53,940
You don't have to do that anymore.

172
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:58,140
What square space you can go there
and you can create your own Web site.

173
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,620
It's so easy that you can setup a store
just like that Bryant did it while we

174
00:09:04,621 --> 00:09:09,621
were doing the commercial Bryant
registered a fucking thing on square space

175
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:10,620
started.

176
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,453
What was it called.

177
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,750
And it was all on the servers.

178
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,820
Now that was a different looks.

179
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,380
However you did for square space 2.

180
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,940
No I made a web site but if you're
thinking of I bought Digg party.

181
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,360
Oh you'd buy Digg party my mouth dot com
dot com although and then didn't you.

182
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,590
But didn't you build a
website with square space.

183
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,340
Yeah.

184
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,240
I did a dolphin.

185
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,310
Sex dolphin website.

186
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,290
I tried to do it right now.

187
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,780
It's Brian.

188
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:40,380
Look Brian is much more technically
advanced than or aware than I'll ever be.

189
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:43,710
He can throw one of these fucking things
together very quickly and he did it

190
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,030
through square space.

191
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:47,910
You know why we're just all
still doing a show as well.

192
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,150
It's super easy if you go to square
space dot com forward slash job.

193
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,680
You can sign up with no credit
card needed and just try it out.

194
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:59,580
You just start building a website and
if you decide to purchase use the offer

195
00:09:59,581 --> 00:10:03,630
code Joe 4 and Joe and 4 for April.

196
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,090
That's all one word or one thing.

197
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,133
Joe for.

198
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,980
And then you get 10 percent off your
first purchase on new accounts includes

199
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,080
monthly and annual plans.

200
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:17,460
And again that square space
dot com forward slash Joe.

201
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:22,680
And if you're going to enter in the code
use the code Joe for CSL some shekels

202
00:10:22,681 --> 00:10:25,820
sun on your fat juicy Web site.

203
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,133
It's

204
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,460
definitely I can create
a Web site on this.

205
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,480
In a way that I never could in real life
because I am just way too HDD for that

206
00:10:36,031 --> 00:10:36,864
shit.

207
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,760
I'm not going to learn and do that.

208
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:39,800
I had to.

209
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,770
I have one where I'm trying to keep
up with but this looks this looks even

210
00:10:43,771 --> 00:10:44,100
better.

211
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,240
It's dope pretty easy.

212
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,193
Super easy.

213
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,000
Yeah yeah it's good.

214
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,103
Go get it.

215
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,080
So delicious.

216
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,170
We're also brought to
you by Audible dot com.

217
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,510
I was actually listening to.

218
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,770
Do you know why I got hooked on man.

219
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,800
I'm hooked on now.

220
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,053
How dare you.

221
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,080
I read super awesome Dan
Carlin's Hardcore History.

222
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,100
Oh yeah.

223
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,933
Dude.

224
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:06,840
God damn.

225
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,360
Ever since we had a guy on
the show we had on a podcast.

226
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,950
Guy was great to talk to.

227
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:11,940
Fascinating guy.

228
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:16,260
Really really interesting intelligent guy
but when it comes to history he's been

229
00:11:16,261 --> 00:11:17,850
putting together like forever.

230
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:23,150
He's been putting together these history
podcasts and they're like a show.

231
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:29,330
It's not like a podcast like this sloppy
unorganized mass that I try to fucking

232
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:30,680
serve up to Fox.

233
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:37,040
Dan Carlin puts on a god damn show and
he he puts it on in like this really

234
00:11:38,491 --> 00:11:43,491
entertaining way and gives you this
thorough history of all these events but

235
00:11:43,951 --> 00:11:46,260
like really exciting stuff.

236
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:47,780
What are you doing.

237
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,850
You chatting with Kara.

238
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:49,560
I care.

239
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,350
I'm single you.

240
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,240
Hey dude how dare you.

241
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,240
How dare you even give
people the idea to do that.

242
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:59,010
No care is gonna be super upset
with you and probably sue this show.

243
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,300
Fine.

244
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,300
I'll see what I'm here is like some
super hardcore feminist and she's like

245
00:12:03,301 --> 00:12:04,440
enough Joe Rogan.

246
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,540
What if she's in India fingering yourself.

247
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:12,670
Oh easy over here with the thing
is I'm on hardcore history.

248
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:15,563
I'm on the.

249
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:16,770
The Mongols.

250
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,150
Now he's got this.

251
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:19,780
I don't know how many parts it is.

252
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,880
I mean part 3.

253
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,940
It's fucking amazing.

254
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,900
It's so great and it's
available on audible dot com.

255
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,630
He's got all the back episodes.

256
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:35,720
I mean he's been doing it
since I think he said 2005.

257
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,760
So you know this guy's got a solid
eight years of podcasts under him.

258
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,920
It's crazy and they're awesome.

259
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:48,820
I listened to one on Germany in
World War 2 the bombings of Europe.

260
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,630
He's so fucking cool to listen to.

261
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:57,470
It's really bad ass if you go to all
we've got Audible dot com Ford slash Joe.

262
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:03,140

265
00:13:15,751 --> 00:13:20,490
other really interesting things to

266
00:13:20,491 --> 00:13:21,324
Anthony.

267
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,390
You can you can get
that on audible as well.

268
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:28,620
It's a cool service and
I've been a fan for years.

269
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:33,360
I'm a huge fan of audio
books this Hardcore History
has been making my life like

270
00:13:33,361 --> 00:13:35,130
so much more interesting
the last couple of days.

271
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,930
Like when I get in my car I'm not like
thinking oh you know you get my car and

272
00:13:39,931 --> 00:13:43,260
drove and probably stuck in traffic I'm
going to go all let's hear more about

273
00:13:43,261 --> 00:13:43,950
the Mongols.

274
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:44,700
That's what I'm thinking.

275
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,570
It's just Genghis Khan
was a mother fucker.

276
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:52,700
Yeah dude King Kong killed almost
70 million people by some counts.

277
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:55,040
Some accounts say more than that.

278
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,950
Some accounts say but
as little as 10 million.

279
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,260
Like He definitely killed 10 million.

280
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,450
God damn it's unbelievable.

281
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:03,683
That's the best.

282
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:08,570
They're talking about armies that were
coming towards China where the Mongols

283
00:14:08,571 --> 00:14:12,560
had been and in the distance they
thought they saw snow covered mountains.

284
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:16,490
But when they got close they
realized there were mounds of bones.

285
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:17,623
Oh my God.

286
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:22,750
The Mongols had killed 10 million people
in this one town they came to this

287
00:14:24,211 --> 00:14:27,990
gigantic state and just
killed 10 million people.

288
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,110
It was amazing.

289
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,990
I mean horrific terrifying.

290
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:38,230
Just the idea that that at one point
in time just in the twelve hundred's

291
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:43,400
relatively short amount of time ago there
was a guy who brought a bunch of other

292
00:14:43,401 --> 00:14:48,401
dudes with him on horseback and just
fucked up the whole world banded together

293
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:54,890
took hostages took the hostages pushed
them to the front lines so the hostages

294
00:14:54,901 --> 00:14:59,820
would literally lead the way and people
would be defending their towns having to

295
00:14:59,821 --> 00:15:04,020
shoot arrows at their own friends who
had been kidnapped their own loved ones

296
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:08,880
their own children the Mongols
were fucking terrifying.

297
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:14,990
It's terrifying to think that just a
thousand years ago not even there was a

298
00:15:15,661 --> 00:15:20,661
dude who figured out a way to get
hundreds of thousands of mass murderers to

299
00:15:21,481 --> 00:15:22,314
work together.

300
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,200
Hundreds of thousands of serial killers.

301
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,840
Hundreds of thousands of brutal rapists.

302
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,700
Hundreds of thousands of
ruthless remorseless murderers.

303
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,920
And they got together on horseback.

304
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,600
It takes one convincing leader.

305
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:40,890
God damn Genghis Khan must have been a
mother fucker because there was nobody

306
00:15:40,891 --> 00:15:45,720
like that before and nobody liked that
since his sons tried to hang on to it for

307
00:15:45,721 --> 00:15:47,950
a little while but you know what.

308
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:52,970
The reign of power all really came
through that one bad motherfucker.

309
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:58,940
They had a crazy saying that an armies
of donkey led by a lion could conquer an

310
00:16:01,621 --> 00:16:03,950
army of lions led by a donkey.

311
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:09,830
They were all about tactics and they
would beat much larger armies with severe

312
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,580
superior strategy and cunning
and just ruthlessness.

313
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,650
Just everybody was terrified of them.

314
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:20,810
They just they killed everybody man men
women children babies they didn't give a

315
00:16:20,811 --> 00:16:21,140
fuck.

316
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,280
They killed everybody.

317
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,570
They eight people.

318
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,130
They hate each other.

319
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,240
They got too hungry.

320
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,610
They would draw straws maybe or figure
out how they would figure out you know if

321
00:16:30,611 --> 00:16:34,370
someone's gonna sacrifice themselves so
that the army could go on and they would

322
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,530
slaughter them and eat them and cook them.

323
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,440
Dude it's unbelievable.

324
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,270
I was only a thousand years ago.

325
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,450
What the fuck man.

326
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:47,060
You think it will ever anybody
else ever pull that off again.

327
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,880
That kind of craziness
that's terrifying to wonder.

328
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:55,390
I think if you had to worry about
anything it would be worry about all this

329
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,550
beautiful city shit shutting down.

330
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,750
That's the real fear.

331
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:05,050
The real fear is we have some massive
disaster like a solar flare that knocks

332
00:17:06,231 --> 00:17:09,710
out our power grid and our
ability to pump gas is gone.

333
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,320
Our ability to drive back
and forth to places is gone.

334
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:16,850
Our ability to get food people's gone
and then you realize how nutty we are

335
00:17:16,851 --> 00:17:21,830
spread out and how dangerous this is and
how vulnerable we are living like this.

336
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:26,480
I think you would take something like
that to bring people to some place where

337
00:17:26,481 --> 00:17:28,910
you could get that many
psychopaths all together again.

338
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:33,320
Yeah I think now that we have the
internet if the Internet went down I think

339
00:17:33,321 --> 00:17:37,420
shit we get crazy really quick because
everybody needs it and is used to it now.

340
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,740
Everything down to the G.P.S.

341
00:17:39,741 --> 00:17:40,820
and just everything.

342
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,080
Yeah we're terrified.

343
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:45,350
I'm terrified of leaving leaving the
house that my fucking cell phone right.

344
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,880
I'm a little bitch.

345
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,770
I'm a little bitch the machine.

346
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:52,730
Speaking of machine we're
talking about the human machine.

347
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,770
Our last sponsor on it dot com.

348
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:58,320

shit to get your Fitness on.

00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,510
No that's not armor Bryan.

352
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,060
It's a weight vest.

353
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,450
It's not armor even though it
pride protect you a little bit.

354
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,350
There we go.

355
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,320
We also have steel Masons and steel clubs.

356
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,290
These are not weapons.

357
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:17,630
These are designed for
functional athletic improvement.

358
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:21,230
What all these things that were selling
like kettle bells and battle ropes.

359
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,980
They're all for what's to develop
what's best to develop what they call

360
00:18:24,981 --> 00:18:26,300
functional strength.

361
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,330
We have medicine balls as
well functional strength.

362
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,590
We sell a pull up bar functional strength
like the ability to move your body

363
00:18:33,591 --> 00:18:34,910
around as one unit.

364
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,480
It's one of the most important aspects
of fitness and one of the things that

365
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:42,020
people screw up on is if
they try to get in shape.

366
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,140
They don't know what the fuck they're
doing they do like too many bicep curls or

367
00:18:45,141 --> 00:18:50,141
too many like bench presses and shit
you can whack your body out making it

368
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:51,374
imbalanced.

369
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:56,540
It's one of the best ways to get fit
like a full body fit is to do things that

370
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,610
require you to use the body as one unit.

371
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,750
I'm obsessed with that.

372
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,170
Obviously that's why I talk about
it every week but I've seen massive

373
00:19:03,171 --> 00:19:08,171
improvements for my jujitsu
athletic benefits of training
like this and I always

374
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:10,890
encourage people to do it
because really fun too.

375
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:15,140
And you can get a great workout and
literally in 20 minutes you could do a

376

supplements.

386
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:50,450
How long.

387
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:52,270
How long till you have
like a health helmet.

388
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,430
If we if it comes out do we'll sell it.

389
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:58,490
If there's a health element that comes
out that puts you in a healthy state of

390
00:19:58,491 --> 00:19:59,324
mind.

391
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,230
What if there was a helmet that came on
that immediately felt like someone was

392
00:20:03,231 --> 00:20:04,040
sucking your dick.

393
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,360
How.

394
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,990
How quick before they
would make that illegal.

395
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:11,660
Like immediately like they found a spot
on your brain where they can joke with

396
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:15,950
electricity and it totally feels like
someone's sucking your dick a helmet that

397
00:20:15,951 --> 00:20:17,960
helps your helmet a
helmet for your helmet.

398
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,810
Exactly how much do you think they
would make that women would make that

399
00:20:20,811 --> 00:20:21,644
illegal.

400
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:25,130
Would it be men and maybe a little bitch
about it a lot of men would make it

401
00:20:25,131 --> 00:20:28,110
illegal because they'd never get
real blow jobs over again girls.

402
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,340
But just put the fucking helmet on
kind of why do you want me to do this.

403
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,330
It'd be a tough situation for women if
the helmet worked that well it came.

404
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,950
You think they would lose a
little bit of their value.

405
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,240
Is that what you're saying.

406
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,740
Oh yeah I think I should be walking
her out these helmets on helmet.

407
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:44,420
What's the normal thing.

408
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:47,600
How much time do you think it is
before something like that is invented

409
00:20:47,601 --> 00:20:51,890
something that can recreate an artificial
experience like almost almost exactly.

410
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,480
I'll bet you 15 20 years.

411
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,800
I bet it's not that far away.

412
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:59,000
The way things are moving and shaking
there's probably a bigger team of

413
00:20:59,001 --> 00:21:01,910
scientists on that right now
than there is on cancer research.

414
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:02,770
You're right.

415
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:04,310
Everybody is building the helmet.

416
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:10,080
Everybody wants to get their
dicks sucked and then wrote on it.

417
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,870
Thought Tom Ford slashed Joe.

418
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,100
Cue the music Brian.

419
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,630
Let's get this bitch started.

420
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,340
Boom son

421
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,300
the will gain experience.

422
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,530
We're full Tony.

423
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,580
George Clooney.

424
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:33,620
That's me.

425
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,453
That's the song.

426
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:36,140
That's the powerful Tony Hinchcliffe song.

427
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,010
I say it like that.

428
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:37,873
I sing like a woman.

429
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:38,510
And then you go.

430
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,930
That's me like a little kid.

431
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,060
Hey everybody.

432
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,960
Somebody put that on a loop
when you have your own podcast.

433
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:48,110
What are you guys going to do a podcast
that once you guys where it are in the

434
00:21:48,111 --> 00:21:49,850
works it starts Oh okay Lucky.

435
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:50,923
Two weeks.

436
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,730
I think we sat in preproduction.

437
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:57,780
Yeah niceness niceness until he's gonna
be with me on this Wednesday night at

438
00:21:57,951 --> 00:21:59,510
the icehouse went to the ice ones it.

439
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:00,390
Sure.

440
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:00,870
10:00.

441
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:01,140
OK.

442
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:04,460
Brian's going to be there too as
well as Tom Seger and Burt Krisha.

443
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,500
Oh shit bitches.

444
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,530
That's right.

445
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,110
You heard sweet.

446
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,063
That's right.

447
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,480
Tony is an up and coming young standup.

448
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,390
I love one of my favorite
things in life for real.

449
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:22,570
This really is absolutely true is when
I don't know about someone and then I

450
00:22:22,671 --> 00:22:23,870
find out that they're funny.

451
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,570
Like when I found out about it from Brian.

452
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,890
Brian told me about you.

453
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:33,790
And as a comedian like one of things that
every comedian always loves is seeing

454
00:22:34,131 --> 00:22:35,760
a new comedian like some.

455
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:39,680
Someone who knew who's funny like does
another one say oh there's another one

456
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:44,210
you know and different
styles and different you
know different takes but when

457
00:22:44,211 --> 00:22:46,880
they're funny like it's really
it gives you a lot of hope.

458
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:49,070
And I was I was in L.A.

459
00:22:49,071 --> 00:22:53,600
the entire time like you started comedy
and you know and then started getting a

460
00:22:53,601 --> 00:22:54,740
little a name for yourself.

461
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:58,460
And then eventually got to the point
where you're you know regularly doing you

462
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:01,390
know podcasts and comedy clubs and yeah.

463
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,230
So that's that's a
really cool thing to say.

464
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,390
Yeah it's really so much fun.

465
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:06,950
Pretty incredible.

466
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,270
So few people pull it off.

467
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:12,860
You know I love watching somebody who
comes through like some new person is

468
00:23:12,861 --> 00:23:13,450
funny.

469
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:17,450
It's like because we to all the class
thing and like you said everybody's a

470
00:23:17,451 --> 00:23:18,340
little bit different.

471
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:20,930
Everybody has their you
know their take on things.

472
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,530
But when you find one there's nothing
cooler it's sort of like when you love

473
00:23:24,531 --> 00:23:27,680
comedy it's like watching a baby
being born like just like that.

474
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,753
Wow.

475
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,330
Yeah.

476
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:31,670
Larson's hilarious and when.

477
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:36,690
You know like you when you run into
someone and you you realize that you know

478
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:41,720
they started out sucky and you probably
saw them in like those during those

479
00:23:41,721 --> 00:23:42,650
first couple of months.

480
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:47,270
And then within a couple of years they
become competent and then boom they

481
00:23:47,271 --> 00:23:50,940
become really good and they like
like Ari is my favorite example.

482
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:51,740
Oh yeah.

483
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:56,430
I was there when Ari first got on stage
like one of his first sets one of the

484
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:57,283
earliest sets.

485
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:03,070
And you know I've watched him become like
a real killer like Ari Shapiro is like

486
00:24:03,081 --> 00:24:03,914
a real killer.

487
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:04,730
He did.

488
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:09,370
Tom Seger is party of day top scorer
had a benefit rather for his doggy.

489
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,583
He got a sick dog.

490
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:13,850
If you if you love dogs
you love Tom Segura.

491
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,050
I don't know how you would donate.

492
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,830
I think they have like a paper out there
so don't go to your mom's house podcast

493
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,890
on your mom's house podcast dot com.

494
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:23,300
Tom Sawyer is just one
of the coolest guys ever.

495
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:28,810
And he had the show and Ari went up and
fucking destroyed destroyed with a bunch

496
00:24:31,941 --> 00:24:34,820
of shit that I hadn't heard before to
those couple bits that were really funny

497
00:24:34,821 --> 00:24:35,510
that were new.

498
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,790
He writes like a machine.

499
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,090
Yeah he's awesome.

500
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:38,690
He's isn't here.

501
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:40,460
He's just coming up with so much content.

502
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:41,090
Yeah.

503
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:46,090
I think he also realizes at this time
that he's like you know he's again he's

504
00:24:46,281 --> 00:24:47,114
like a real comic now.

505
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,740
Now it's just a matter of doing the work.

506
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:52,160
And he's a smart dude you know he knows
how to he knows how to put it down.

507
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:57,190
He knows what needs to be done and he
can go get it done just as as a fan of

508
00:24:57,531 --> 00:24:58,280
comics.

509
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,260
It's so cool and someone pops up.

510
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:05,920
There's another one I got really lucky
with Ari because he was the first person

511
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:08,960
I asked me to do a gig
with him and Sam Tripoli.

512
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:12,950
So was those two guys all of a sudden
all at once I went to La Hoya with Sam

513
00:25:12,951 --> 00:25:16,100
first and then did a gig
and like Irvine with Ari.

514
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:16,993
What year was this.

515
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:19,610
This is about 2008.

516
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,410
That's so recently.

517
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,560
That's awesome.

518
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:29,170
Five years I don't think of it as being
recently but you know there was like a

519
00:25:29,211 --> 00:25:33,960
year or so that I was doing it before
you even get a road gig like that you're

520
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:34,820
just building it.

521
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:38,780
I was you know just riding my
bicycle from open mike to open mike.

522
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,210
How many guys that started out with you.

523
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:45,920
You know we all have like kind of like
groups of people that we sort of start

524
00:25:45,921 --> 00:25:49,760
off around a similar time and then you
watch each other either fall off or give

525
00:25:49,761 --> 00:25:51,950
up or are some people get through the net.

526
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:57,320
How many people that with your class
do you think got through with my true

527
00:25:57,321 --> 00:25:57,770
class.

528
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:59,700
I'd probably say about good.

529
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:04,190
It's a tough one because
we're still pulling you know
and I mean you still don't

530
00:26:04,191 --> 00:26:07,520
know who can make like a bit throw a
right hook right at the end before they

531
00:26:07,521 --> 00:26:10,820
drop out and have a new 15 minutes
the crushes and it's a breakthrough.

532
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:14,780
But I probably guess about
seven or ten right around there.

533
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:15,590
That's a good number.

534
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:19,460
Like still doing I mean you know I'm
counting my original starting classes like

535
00:26:19,461 --> 00:26:24,461
a good you know 60 70 80 90 right people
because I know the I mean I stayed in

536
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:30,380
Hollywood and built in Hollywood like
Los Angeles because I feel like a lot of

537
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:33,080
people start somewhere
and then come to L.A.

538
00:26:33,081 --> 00:26:34,110
I'm like You know what I'm going to.

539
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:40,060
I wanted to just have a like an NBA style
perspective like Chappelle once said

540
00:26:40,251 --> 00:26:44,870
and he was doing a spot on stage one
night and the LR really late crushing

541
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,110
making it look like I mean
it was just unbelievable.

542
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:52,190
And the three or four hours and he goes
the back Laramie goes hey how many guys

543
00:26:52,191 --> 00:26:52,521
are L.A.

544
00:26:52,521 --> 00:26:54,090
comics and a lot of people clapping.

545
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:59,210
But how many of you are like work here
at the Comedy Store and started here at

546
00:26:59,211 --> 00:27:00,080
the Comedy Store.

547
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,570
That was just two or
three of us that clap.

548
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,550
He goes You guys are insane.

549
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:07,160
He's performing to a
lot of comedians right.

550
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:11,870
So the thing with him coming back a few
years ago was like the audience that got

551
00:27:11,871 --> 00:27:15,870
to be there was there but the back
of the room filled up to the gills.

552
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:16,813
Right.

553
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:21,050
And he said that it's like learning how
to dribble in the NBA starting comedy at

554
00:27:21,051 --> 00:27:21,890
the Comedy Store.

555
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:23,420
And it's so true.

556
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:26,870
But but if you think about that start
learning how to dribble in the NBA and

557
00:27:26,871 --> 00:27:31,010
you're you and you're just used to the
motion of a thousand miles an hour.

558
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:33,380
Yeah then that works out.

559
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:35,750
I think it's like anything else.

560
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:40,810
You know it's a more difficult but
also more rewarding pursuit pursuit.

561
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:46,280
You know you can take an
easy route through life or
you can you know I mean it's

562
00:27:46,281 --> 00:27:47,690
not as hard as being a Navy SEAL.

563
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,900
Let's be honest you know even though
doing comedy is hard and a lot of people

564
00:27:50,901 --> 00:27:54,860
don't ever figured out it's not nearly
as hard as doing something you hate and

565
00:27:54,861 --> 00:27:59,210
being stuck working 40 hours a week at
this job for the rest of your life until

566
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:01,790
your heart stops beating because
you have no passion right.

567
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:05,540
And I mean it was a real struggle for a
few years I really threw myself to the

568
00:28:05,541 --> 00:28:05,930
wolves.

569
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:08,780
I didn't have sure I
didn't have money saved up.

570
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:12,800
I was just I was just doing it and then
I got the job working at the Comedy

571
00:28:12,801 --> 00:28:14,510
Store a couple of months
and like as a door guy.

572
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:17,420
So I started getting spots a lot
there which is what I wanted.

573
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:20,600
You know the problem the story
like yours is that it worked.

574
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:25,460
So there's a lot of the dudes out
there that will try that same thing but

575
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:27,380
they're not fucking funny at all.

576
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,890
You know what's tough is it is I noticed
that a lot a lot of people come up to

577
00:28:30,891 --> 00:28:33,230
me and say I'm thinking
about starting standup Tony.

578
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:38,240
You know what do you what do you think
and sometimes they don't they just

579
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,660
sometimes I wonder out of all the times
I get asked this from somebody that

580
00:28:41,661 --> 00:28:46,661
wants to start standup it's like you have
to really have a crazy mind ingrained

581
00:28:46,731 --> 00:28:48,920
in you it's not something
you start and learn like.

582
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,480
I was in trouble.

583
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:57,810
Every class in school not once a day at
school like every class every teacher

584
00:28:58,751 --> 00:28:59,110
hated me.

585
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:03,040
I never touched and I was never like
spilled milk on somebody I never did

586
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:06,520
anything physical but verbally I was just.

587
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:11,200
It's the it's what I did is pretty crazy.

588
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:16,120
And I mean you know like so you just
always talk to Russia totally to the

589
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:17,800
extreme all the time.

590
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:21,390
And that's that's like Kid energy you
know I'm talking about the fun even now.

591
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:22,880
Now I'm like I'll even.

592
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:27,790
I'm still young it's like I'm not half
of the quick wit that I used to be before

593
00:29:27,791 --> 00:29:32,740
I realized I wasn't now I overthinking
is a defense thing you learned it from

594
00:29:32,741 --> 00:29:35,270
your parents like I learned of you Dad.

595
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:39,340
It's really an interesting situation is
the way I raised I was raised with so

596
00:29:39,341 --> 00:29:43,390
weird that I know it has something to
do with that because I have these four

597
00:29:43,391 --> 00:29:46,540
older brothers and sisters
that are much older than me.

598
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:50,920
So it's like I mean it's 12 years between
me and my closest sibling and they're

599
00:29:50,921 --> 00:29:51,880
all much older.

600
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,340
Oh wow yeah.

601
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,430
So you probably exposed to like they
probably give you a hard time and pretty

602
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,600
fucked with you really they
were absolutely all super cool.

603
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,580
They were actually super cool.

604
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,670
That's how I and that's sometimes I
wonder how it didn't end up like that.

605
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,970
I mean there were times you know there
was the old you know you were adopted.

606
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,870
Why do you think you're.

607
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:11,880
Well you know what.

608
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,560
When they're 12 years apart I don't
think you're actually going to get them

609
00:30:14,561 --> 00:30:17,680
because they're gonna be sweet to you
you're like happy for a little brother and

610
00:30:17,681 --> 00:30:18,280
sister.

611
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,530
It's when you two years apart you know.

612
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:24,070
Yeah I've I've known a lot of brothers
beat the fuck out of each other.

613
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:24,990
Yeah.

614
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:28,570
Obviously that album Luckily with the
age gap like they were in college when I

615
00:30:28,571 --> 00:30:30,430
was you know in kindergarten and stuff.

616
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:33,820
What was interesting about
that is I definitely think
it played a role because I

617
00:30:33,821 --> 00:30:38,650
was hanging out with 20 year olds when
I was a little kid and they probably

618
00:30:38,651 --> 00:30:40,690
thought I was really funny
when you talk shit too.

619
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,670
Totally.

620
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:42,640
This whole thing.

621
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:46,450
That's what I would do I would talk shit
and I would put on terrible magic shows

622
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:50,940
in which the whole ongoing joke was that
you can clearly see you know I had not

623
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:53,450
seen comedian magicians right yet.

624
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:58,000
I was just trying to do magic but I was
bad at it but I could just the way I

625
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:02,590
like that and well it started I had to
get good at doing it on purpose because

626
00:31:02,591 --> 00:31:06,040
it was happening accidentally and I
would just try to follow through with it.

627
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,120
So you started off trying to be good.

628
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:09,463
Yeah

629
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:11,950
right.

630
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,920
But then I just got good
at being that magic.

631
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:19,180
Yeah it's a funny thing when you see
someone who grew up like in a weird spot

632
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:19,960
like that.

633
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,170
I think all of us like every comic I
know grew up in some sort of a weird

634
00:31:23,171 --> 00:31:27,590
situation where some basic
need wasn't fulfilled.

635
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,550
So that creates like
this weird personality.

636
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,413
Totally.

637
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:35,740
I even though I love comics when that
when it doesn't create that weird

638
00:31:35,741 --> 00:31:40,300
personality it just creates fucked up
people you know like if you don't put it

639
00:31:40,301 --> 00:31:44,830
to use like creating something that weird
energy that comes out of a weird life.

640
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:49,030
If you did that shit will haunt you like
that can that can wreck your life if

641
00:31:49,031 --> 00:31:53,920
you're one of those really creative people
or more impulsive people and doesn't

642
00:31:53,921 --> 00:31:56,590
do anything about it don't doesn't
focus in on something yeah.

643
00:31:57,110 --> 00:32:00,700
And it's just that's an interesting
point because with me I didn't have any

644
00:32:00,701 --> 00:32:05,701
creative outlet until like after high
school because the theater woman always

645
00:32:06,821 --> 00:32:08,080
wanted me to join theater.

646
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,330
Yeah but I never did.

647
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:15,400
And I mean the only outlet other than
doing it in front of people all the time

648
00:32:15,401 --> 00:32:18,070
and just you know being me I had nothing.

649
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:21,100
So then I spent a few
years like what am I.

650
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:22,510
Because you don't know

651
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:29,530
if you're just a kid that loves making
people laugh that you can be a standup

652
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,393
comedian right.

653
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:35,480
When you're in Ohio
there's no people in L.A.

654
00:32:35,481 --> 00:32:39,650
are really lucky or in New York around
those areas because there's comedy there

655
00:32:39,651 --> 00:32:42,920
at least you can stumble across a comedy
club and go and wonder what's going on

656
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:43,100
there.

657
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,110
I might go in there tonight just one time.

658
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:50,030
First time I was ever at a comedy club
was at the Comedy Store and I had signed

659
00:32:50,031 --> 00:32:52,330
up for the open mike and gotten on.

660
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,930
So it's very grandiose.

661
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:56,450
I mean you know it's like my
heart was beating out of my chest.

662
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,920
I knew that it was something I was gonna
be doing forever no matter what how you

663
00:32:59,921 --> 00:33:00,540
knew it.

664
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:04,920
You know it was something I definitely
didn't know the first time I went on

665
00:33:04,921 --> 00:33:05,754
stage

666
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:09,270
I was I was scared shitless to the waist.

667
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,560
More scared than I
thought I was going to be.

668
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,350
Oh I never I It is unbelievable.

669
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,330
It is so creepy because what ended up
happening was is I've blanked out and

670
00:33:18,331 --> 00:33:22,740
forgot everything that I'd been and
that was the one time that I was I had a

671
00:33:22,741 --> 00:33:25,410
couple months to prepare
for three minutes.

672
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,270
Did you bring notes on stage with you.

673
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,010
No I never liked.

674
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,220
I've never liked having
notes onstage with me.

675
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:34,290
That was a big thing man
getting rid of your notes.

676
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,940
I was a big thing back in the day.

677
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,350
Going on stage with notes still.

678
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,130
Yeah.

679
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:40,920
Because in the beginning I definitely
went on stage with notes when I first

680
00:33:40,921 --> 00:33:44,490
started doing it but I saw like really
good guys go on stage with notes when

681
00:33:44,491 --> 00:33:45,570
they were working on new shit.

682
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:50,180
Yeah it became like part of the act
that they let you know they were trying

683
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,840
stuff out by looking down at the paper.

684
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:55,020
But you try to do the first one free ball.

685
00:33:55,860 --> 00:34:00,860
Yeah like really bad in a I somehow was
just digging myself out by calling out

686
00:34:03,721 --> 00:34:05,220
how terrible it was.

687
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,830
I just I was basically saying
Wow I just blanked out.

688
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:13,050
And I've been getting ready for this
for so long and so I just ended up doing

689
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:16,740
what actually ended up sort of becoming
my style which is like calling out

690
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:22,300
whatever's happening in the room except
I was just joking about me bombing.

691
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:24,980
You kind of have to call out
what's happened in the room right.

692
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:25,790
Oh yeah.

693
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,110
And that's that's one.

694
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:31,550
Another good thing rather that the
comedy store provides no crowd control.

695
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,540
Right.

696
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,373
None.

697
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,250
That place is madness.

698
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:37,070
There's something I could be madness.

699
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,490
That's why I like it was so modern.

700
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,370
Anything can happen at the Comedy Store.

701
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:44,750
So like for example like when we did
that show in Indianapolis and I came out

702
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,700
and I'm looking at the masses of people
but the first thing that I notice to my

703
00:34:49,701 --> 00:34:54,701
left is this lady lit up next to the
stage that's doing sign language to the to

704
00:34:56,091 --> 00:34:56,924
the audience.

705
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,800
And I just couldn't help but the start
like I always say you know it started

706
00:35:00,801 --> 00:35:03,450
just with I've never performed in
front of one of these people before.

707
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:04,810
I've always wondered
what that would be like.

708
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,430
And I'm noticing that she has to keep
up with everything that I'm saying.

709
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:13,300
So like I went off on this whole run
about it that it's just so much fun for me

710
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:18,460
and I could trust my instinct and just
keep going with it because I even though

711
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:23,660
like I wouldn't have known to do that
if I was just trying to just put on like

712
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:24,470
an act.

713
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:24,790
Right.

714
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:25,550
Right.

715
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:26,240
Yeah.

716
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,170
Which is also great.

717
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,470
But I got to go off on a run there and
I could trust that instinct you know by

718
00:35:30,471 --> 00:35:33,770
the end I have her doing blow job motions
to her face because I realized that if

719
00:35:33,771 --> 00:35:38,660
I said the word blow job she has to do
that jerk off that is on her face or off

720
00:35:38,661 --> 00:35:41,000
on the face is the that's
the sign language for that.

721
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,050
Yeah.

722
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:44,720
This is blow job or at least
that's what she was doing.

723
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:48,950
Actually was he because they switched
halfway through the whole thing but they

724
00:35:48,951 --> 00:35:53,540
switched the trick was like enough tone
handling so I think so I just quit.

725
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:56,870
I don't I don't know what happened how
did you have a backup so close that you

726
00:35:56,910 --> 00:36:01,760
they get tired I guess so signing maybe
you need like really good hand cardio

727
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,160
but not being crazy.

728
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:06,350
I had you know crazy a ton of tweets.

729
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:10,280
Indianapolis was so much fun and everybody
was like hash tagging sign language

730
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:12,500
because I couldn't even
believe what was going on.

731
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:17,890
Yeah I did that once in San Francisco
a guy brought his own remember that.

732
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:18,660
Yeah.

733
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,700
And he sat right in the front.

734
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,180
Yeah.

735
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,360
Guy brought his own sign person.

736
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:24,470
I was like wow that's pretty gangster.

737
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:25,450
Guy was deaf.

738
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:29,830
You want to go see some comedies like
I'm tell you they're saying Yeah you look

739
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,850
really nice guys.

740
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:31,850
That was a fun show.

741
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:32,810
He did.

742
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:36,020
I forget what he did because it was a
I was obviously timing things he didn't

743
00:36:36,021 --> 00:36:36,854
talk.

744
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:38,060
It was really funny.

745
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:42,410
It was really funny like you could tell
the guy like really enjoyed standup

746
00:36:42,411 --> 00:36:43,130
comedy.

747
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:45,900
And even though he was
deaf he still understood.

748
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:46,843
Like what.

749
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:48,440
You know he understood jokes.

750
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,950
It's got to be weird because he's
only getting it like two dimensional.

751
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:53,090
Right.

752
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:54,420
You don't if you don't hear it.

753
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,360
Yeah man you're missing so much.

754
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,380
Like there's a lot of guys like Joey Díaz
perfect example of you half of what's

755
00:37:00,381 --> 00:37:05,381
funny is how he sounds like you know the
way sounds is the fucking intensity of

756
00:37:06,411 --> 00:37:07,244
his voice.

757
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:10,640
Well it's like when he when he hits
those six when he starts screaming about

758
00:37:10,641 --> 00:37:15,641
something like he was screaming about
it's blue cheese with buffalo wings or go

759
00:37:16,731 --> 00:37:19,550
fuck your mother it was
just fucking ranch dressing.

760
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:24,560
He went on his rant about ranch dressing
and on paper it's like there's nothing

761
00:37:24,561 --> 00:37:25,700
funny about that at all.

762
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,940
But if you hear him if you
hear Joe and you see him do it.

763
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:32,760
It was one of the finest fucking things
I've seen with other passion the arms

764
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:37,370
from deep but I mean maybe this guy had
like a deep sense of his own timing.

765
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:41,510
You know he can interpret it in the finest
way because he was obviously a fan of

766
00:37:41,511 --> 00:37:44,030
stand up comedy enough to hire
his own sign language person.

767
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:48,710
Yeah I've been at a college show once
were they they made them have a sign

768
00:37:48,711 --> 00:37:50,510
language it was like a part of the rules.

769
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,470
Like if someone spoke they
had to have someone there.

770
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,050
That's a I was wondered how
complicated is that sign language.

771
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:02,850
I mean it seems like it seemed really I
was watching some parts of it because at

772
00:38:02,851 --> 00:38:07,030
one point when you were on I walked
around and sort of was watching from the

773
00:38:07,031 --> 00:38:12,031
side ledge area and I noticed that when
you said the word at one point polite

774
00:38:12,571 --> 00:38:17,571
cock this guy had to do this thing
where it was this giant like right.

775
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,370
Well that's the strap on bit.

776
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,030
Right.

777
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,380
Well it was it was something.

778
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:27,790
It was when you were taking questions
at the end it was like you were talking

779
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:30,790
about Dennis Rodman's cock
or something like that.

780
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,580
He was like oh very improvised.

781
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:36,520
Oh the Kim Jong Il thing I was noticing
this guy has to do this thing like that

782
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,230
black cock and sign language.

783
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:39,123
Is this.

784
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:44,240
It's like so stereotypical like it's just
giant and his hands were so far apart

785
00:38:44,771 --> 00:38:48,020
it is like he was describing a
tree stump or something like that.

786
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,240
Like this hand climbing.

787
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,710
I'm like that's black
cock and sign language.

788
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:52,810
Isn't that hilarious.

789
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:55,090
That's what they would come up with.

790
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:55,953
That's the move.

791
00:38:58,050 --> 00:38:58,410
Yeah.

792
00:38:58,410 --> 00:38:59,790
So blow job is this.

793
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,110
I don't know why it's down.

794
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:01,980
Why does it go down.

795
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,970
It seems that you're always on your knees.

796
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:06,790
But that's an awkward angle
tells us to do your blog.

797
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:09,860
That is why it would
be I see a blond giant.

798
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:14,730
Like a child made sign me.

799
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:16,440
You know if so get on a chair.

800
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:22,430
That's ridiculous angle to have that
standard angle to suck a dick and doesn't

801
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,310
make any sense at all.

802
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,550
I'm not going to fire it.

803
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,590
You almost killed.

804
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:34,380
So the first time may say laugh just
thinks it was brilliant at the time was

805
00:39:34,381 --> 00:39:35,130
absolutely brilliant.

806
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:37,540
It was the perfect time if
at first you don't succeed.

807
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,430
Phi Phi again.

808
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:42,720
To you guys get a room get a room.

809
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:42,970
Yeah.

810
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:43,803
Fuck

811
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,590
yeah.

812
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:49,620
We're gonna have to share a room
when we're in the same Sacramento.

813
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,000
I'm sharing a room.

814
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,250
And so why you sharing rooms.

815
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:56,540
Because listen getting your
own rooms you fucking weirdo.

816
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,460
Grown men stop pretending
like you're in high school.

817
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:02,160
OK we're going to get up to her
door we're gonna go fishing.

818
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,900
Get a hotel room together.

819
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:07,170
Shut the fuck up to get your own room.

820
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,860
God damn it was thirty dollars and
ninety cheap fuck thirty dollars a night.

821
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:14,070
Well have you seen the commercials.

822
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,270
We'll keep the light on for you.

823
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,180
Thirty dollars and thirty bucks.

824
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:21,360
Joe we were talking about
it on a recent podcast.

825
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,270
I think you're there Tony.

826
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:27,460
I think it was Ari was saying it was he
was talking about how funny it was going

827
00:40:27,461 --> 00:40:30,900
to the grocery store with you because
like you'd be like you know how much is

828
00:40:30,901 --> 00:40:34,570
macaroni or pasta sauce like you
know 20 dollars whatever it was.

829
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,730
What is toothpaste.

830
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,593
Two dollars.

831
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:38,230
I don't know what I think.

832
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,353
I haven't forever.

833
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:44,100
Eddie Bravo always makes fun of it says
that I would be the worst person ever on

834
00:40:44,101 --> 00:40:47,070
the price is right now because I
literally don't know anything costs.

835
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:51,940
So far there's only room enough my
fucking hand for so much show against it.

836
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,370
There's no room for that.

837
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:57,840
I just got no room for as long as people
aren't riding the streets over the

838
00:40:57,841 --> 00:40:58,674
price of toothpaste.

839
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,540
If they are then I'll
start paying attention.

840
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:01,800
It's like I've got shit to do.

841
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:05,580
I can't be worrying about what shit
costs as long as it's fairly reasonable.

842
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:09,810
But I have friends that are like wealthy
and you hear them go a steak for thirty

843
00:41:09,811 --> 00:41:10,570
nine dollars.

844
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:12,780
Are you telling me that the
state cost thirty nine dollars.

845
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:14,090
Why is this steak three.

846
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,470
Hey just what are you What are you doing.

847
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:17,970
What do you do it's a number.

848
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,170
So what does it even mean.

849
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,640
What the fuck is it even based on.

850
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:21,720
Just shut your mouth.

851
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:22,583
You're not broke.

852
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:27,830
Spend the thirty nine bucks you cheap
fuck you whining asshole you yammering

853
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:30,740
fucking perspective lapping douche bag.

854
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,450
You know we'll get it together you fuck.

855
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:33,920
I went something a real person.

856
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:36,780
Oh what's that Morton's
Steakhouse is a wonderful place.

857
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:40,530
Yeah I love it and I was just in that
it was the only place near me that had

858
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:44,640
crab legs and it cause I was just since
Vegas I've been thinking about those

859
00:41:44,641 --> 00:41:49,641
crab legs from Vegas and I'm 9 yeah from
9 which is most amazing place ever so I

860
00:41:50,011 --> 00:41:54,570
went there to get on and a half pound
was sixty like sixty five dollars and I

861
00:41:54,571 --> 00:41:55,730
was like That's a lot.

862
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:56,603
You get a lot.

863
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:58,330
Four legs is what it was.

864
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,160
But did you watch that
show with the dudes die.

865
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:01,890
Get on those fucking crab boats.

866
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:02,700
No I didn't.

867
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:06,090
That's that's why it's so much it's
because it's really hard to get.

868
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,960
That's what world Deadliest Catch with.

869
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,370
This is what I was getting at.

870
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:13,160
Then the two days later I was thinking
like that didn't I want wanted more.

871
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:14,480
Know I wanted to eat right.

872
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:14,890
Right.

873
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:15,150
Right.

874
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:15,810
You know what I mean.

875
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:18,680
So then I went to Olive
Garden and they had a weight.

876
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:22,560
So I went to the place next door and
stay which is like Outback Steakhouse and

877
00:42:22,561 --> 00:42:27,561
they had them there and they they had
a pound for 40 dollars and then you can

878
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:30,450
add another half pound for 15 bucks.

879
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:35,210
So I cut a pound and a half for the fries
and it tasted pretty much exactly the

880
00:42:35,211 --> 00:42:35,820
same.

881
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:39,450
You could tell that it came out like when
you pulled it out it was like a little

882
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,620
sweet little harder.

883
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:41,160
I guess.

884
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:45,230
Nice buttery mushy as the plate
but still tastes exactly the same.

885
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:46,720
So you think they just overcooked it.

886
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,430
Maybe.

887
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:50,570
I think they're frozen obviously you
know that you could try to tell they did

888
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:53,580
well I think they're all frozen quite
honestly because they're coming from

889
00:42:53,581 --> 00:42:54,370
Alaska.

890
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:56,760
Well I was thinking that's why when the
morning sucks I was like Oh that place

891
00:42:56,761 --> 00:42:57,360
probably gets it.

892
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:57,960
Yeah.

893
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,010
Well they just know how to
fucking do everything right.

894
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:03,700
There's certain places like you know
Morton's there's that other one Flemings

895
00:43:03,701 --> 00:43:04,670
you ever heard of Flemings.

896
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:05,130
Yeah.

897
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:07,260
There's a whole chain of those things
they just know what the fuck they're

898
00:43:07,261 --> 00:43:07,530
doing.

899
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:10,160
You know they sexually work
at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse.

900
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:11,123
Wait a minute hold on a second.

901
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,240
I.

902
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:17,240
I know what you said but I
thought I sexually worked
at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse.

903
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:18,540
That's why I heard you say

904
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,650
that stuff.

905
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:22,650
I was like.

906
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:24,300
I mean what the fuck did he say.

907
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:29,690
And that places and then I realized there
was a slurring or a I used actually I

908
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:31,230
sexually.

909
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:36,230
So I say I used to actually sing as
well you know if you ever heard someone

910
00:43:37,201 --> 00:43:41,700
speak in another language and there was
a little there's they're just rattling

911
00:43:41,701 --> 00:43:44,570
off and you if you don't know what they're
saying you could never discern that

912
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,630
there's more than one word going on
that you don't know when one stops at

913
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,570
another one ends.

914
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:52,620
That was a classic example that I used
to actually you know that's what does

915
00:43:52,621 --> 00:43:52,950
that.

916
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:53,910
That's not a word.

917
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:56,110
It's like a Jeff Dunham bit or something.

918
00:43:57,850 --> 00:43:58,770
No not Jeff Dunham.

919
00:43:58,860 --> 00:43:59,693
What's his name.

920
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:02,970
I might be a redneck guy Fox or Foxworthy.

921
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:07,680
Jeff Foxworthy doesn't have a dad like
dark here like like things he would write

922
00:44:07,681 --> 00:44:11,860
down like D G E 80s DG.

923
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,273
It's.

924
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:18,630
Like you know there is like
red and a redneck vocabulary.

925
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,240
Have you ever seen that show Swamp People.

926
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:22,470
Well they just alligator hunting.

927
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:24,660
Holy fuck man.

928
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:27,000
I'm only going to buy
alligator shit anymore.

929
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,750
I buy like alligators so I buy
like alligator skin things.

930
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:34,590
When I was a little kid an alligator he
displayed his dog and I'll never forget

931
00:44:34,591 --> 00:44:35,424
that I lived there.

932
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:39,660
I lived in Gainesville Florida and
there was a place called Lake Alice and

933
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:40,643
there's alligators.

934
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,000
You see him all the time.

935
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:45,600
And I didn't think nothing of it because
nobody was scared until one of them at

936
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:48,480
this lady's dog I was
like Oh you motherfucker

937
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:54,660
but when you watch these people on these
shows these these alligator hunting

938
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:58,630
shows first of all you realize how many
fucking alligators there are because

939
00:44:58,631 --> 00:45:00,460
they're killing a shitload of them.

940
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:02,890
You know they have like
a tag that they can fill.

941
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:05,580
I don't remember what the guy
was saying but it was like Oh.

942
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,500
I think it was like 500 or something.

943
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:09,550
Let's find out.

944
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:11,800
Alligator tag limits in Florida.

945
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,080
We didn't talk.

946
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:17,500
How was it being in Texas during all
that fucking bomb shit and raised

947
00:45:17,501 --> 00:45:20,990
fertilizer things and crazy crazy.

948
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:26,380
We we we will miss the fertilizer thing
cause I was only there for one day but

949
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:31,750
that the bomb shit all of it is just
the whole thing is when it was something

950
00:45:31,751 --> 00:45:32,584
like that happens.

951
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:37,590
It's so fuckin scary you know Katie
waitress Katie from the Comedy Store.

952
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:38,560
Yeah.

953
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,470
Her cousin's like look
at this photo right here.

954
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,990
Here's the terrorist guy
right here in the hat.

955
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,700
This is him dropping off the bomb.

956
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:46,360
Yeah.

957
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:50,470
Because this is the restaurant and he's
walking the opposite way to the he must

958
00:45:50,471 --> 00:45:52,190
just dropped it off right there right.

959
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:54,440
Here's supposedly the kid that died.

960
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,593
Oh God.

961
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:59,320
Here's her cousins all right over
here and they all lost their limbs.

962
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:00,460
Oh God.

963
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:05,500
And so they're gonna have like a benefit
show soon but that's just a crazy

964
00:46:05,501 --> 00:46:07,860
picture though because it
has it all and all together.

965
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:09,510
What the fuck man.

966
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:13,760
No one knows what any motive yet.

967
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:16,320
Where we're at now in the news.

968
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:21,160
It's all purely speculation because the
brother's dead and the youngest brother

969
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:25,810
is he got shot in the throat Apparently
kneeling ways communicating is writing

970
00:46:25,811 --> 00:46:26,644
things down.

971
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,320
Here's something I just understand.

972
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:33,790
And of course there's a million people
online that are shouting out false flag

973
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:37,360
false flag the government trying to
take out our weapons away and tight down

974
00:46:37,361 --> 00:46:39,940
security and that's why
that's why this is happening.

975
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:43,300
Did you read the kid's Twitter
like I stayed up all night.

976
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:44,470
Sure yeah.

977
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:45,340
Twitter was spooky.

978
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:46,350
I didn't see it.

979
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:46,570
Yeah.

980
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:48,850
His to his Twitter was
really spooky it was weird.

981
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:51,520
It seemed normal day but then he would
throw in like little things like fuck the

982
00:46:51,521 --> 00:46:54,370
police and then or something
like Mohammed something.

983
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:58,960
Well I think if you're going to paraphrase
a guy he's a fucking murder or the

984
00:46:58,961 --> 00:47:03,820
least he could do is go to his Twitter
page you lazy and actually read the

985
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:04,600
night.

986
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,000
I'm not my greatest guy.

987
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:07,540
That's what he said.

988
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:08,560
That was one of his tweets.

989
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:10,540
Yeah.

990
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:12,160
He goes on mostly kind
of a stress free guy.

991
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:14,080
This is after he had blown people up.

992
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,580
Yeah allegedly.

993
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:19,560
Of course this is the kid that
survived the one that's dead.

994
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:22,750
There's all these disputes
about what happened to him.

995
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:24,730
Some people are saying
the cops ran over him.

996
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,260
He's saying his brother ran over him

997
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:31,130
the whole thing sounds like and
people are crying out conspiracy.

998
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:35,000
One thing you have to realize about
information whenever there's a tragedy or

999
00:47:35,001 --> 00:47:38,930
whenever there's anything that's like
really scary like this you know there's a

1000
00:47:38,931 --> 00:47:39,764
terrorist bombing.

1001
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:43,550
It's people panic and you get a whole
bunch different versions of the truth.

1002
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:46,730
And it's not a conspiracy
a lot of times it's just.

1003
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:48,200
No one knows what the fuck is going on.

1004
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:53,060
Everybody's terrified and stories spread
very quickly like they thought at one

1005
00:47:53,061 --> 00:47:56,210
point in time that one of the suspects
was a missing University student from

1006
00:47:56,211 --> 00:47:57,044
Brown.

1007
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:03,100
And he was believes an Indian young man
and his family had been looking for him

1008
00:48:04,101 --> 00:48:07,220
for like a month and they distributed
this video and people are saying this is

1009
00:48:07,221 --> 00:48:08,210
one of the suspects.

1010
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:09,570
This is really what happened.

1011
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,390
You become like a jihadist and left.

1012
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:12,770
But that wasn't true at all.

1013
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:15,500
By the morning we found out it
was a totally different person.

1014
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:16,340
So this is not.

1015
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:20,300
This isn't like a conspiracy
to like hide that information.

1016
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:25,570
And I think that's really important when
when people are looking at events like

1017
00:48:25,701 --> 00:48:30,701
this we'll wait till the dust settles
don't just start fucking calling out

1018
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:36,820
conspiracy and calling out red flags and
false flags saying that it's some you

1019
00:48:39,531 --> 00:48:42,170
know nefarious thing going on.

1020
00:48:42,650 --> 00:48:44,270
Whatever it is is horrific.

1021
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:50,020
But jumping on the immediate conspiracy
bandwagon is like Man that is one of the

1022
00:48:51,081 --> 00:48:53,810
worst things for the cause
of questioning things.

1023
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:58,610
And if you ever wanted to be a good
disinformation agent what you do is the

1024
00:48:58,611 --> 00:49:00,590
moment that anything happens.

1025
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:05,510
Start yelling and screaming
it's a conspiracy and expose
every single aspect of

1026
00:49:05,511 --> 00:49:06,344
it.

1027
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,250
That you you feel is corrupt.

1028
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:12,240
That would be the best way for the
government to protect themselves from any

1029
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:17,780
thoughts of being labeled you know as
being a part of a conspiracy because

1030
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:22,530
there's so many nutty people that do that
with every single event that it's like

1031
00:49:22,531 --> 00:49:24,740
they've cried wolf you know.

1032
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:25,933
Yeah

1033
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:30,420
I was so nervous with Greg Fitzsimmons
that night because he was actually down

1034
00:49:30,421 --> 00:49:33,870
there doing shows and I texted him and
he said that the shows were canceled he

1035
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,880
uses in his bed watching movies.

1036
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:36,910
Yeah shows your accounts.

1037
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,540
Oh that one night don't know if it was.

1038
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:39,570
Was it Friday night.

1039
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,460
That was he flew all the way down there.

1040
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:43,810
Yeah that was it was crazy man.

1041
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:47,400
Friday night I was what was even
crazier is how horrible CNN was.

1042
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:50,600
There were like an hour and a half behind
but then you'd like Look was it has to

1043
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:53,130
have Watertown that jam gave me.

1044
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:55,890
It was just like guys throwing grenades.

1045
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,040
This happening this happened like
it was so insane reading that.

1046
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:00,540
And it was also.

1047
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:04,140
It was amazing how censored everything
was or delayed it was on the news.

1048
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:07,680
It's like you think you know that shit's
you know people are getting grenades

1049
00:50:07,681 --> 00:50:09,690
thrown and that would be on
the news immediately you know.

1050
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:12,090
But they were just like talking like oh
you know we're still looking for this

1051
00:50:12,091 --> 00:50:12,840
guy.

1052
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:16,670
It's incredible everybody's a witness
now and everybody's a cameraman now.

1053
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,270
Like what.

1054
00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:22,980
What's happening is you know people
on the streets can beat the news.

1055
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,360
Yeah because they're right there too.

1056
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:29,700
You also don't get a filter meaning you
don't get anyone correcting it either.

1057
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:34,770
So it's interesting because you get you
get instantaneous news but you don't get

1058
00:50:34,771 --> 00:50:35,604
it vetted.

1059
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:36,630
No it doesn't.

1060
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:39,390
People don't make sure that everything
that's coming through is kosher.

1061
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:41,790
Not to the news always
get it gets it right.

1062
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:42,683
They don't.

1063
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:46,010
And I guess it's better to do it that
way where it eventually sorts itself out

1064
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:52,070
but the people that would step in
and sabotage that process and create

1065
00:50:52,501 --> 00:50:56,250
disinformation like a government agency
could be pretty fucking successful at

1066
00:50:56,251 --> 00:50:59,790
doing that I think and there's probably
a bunch of people that are hired to do

1067
00:50:59,791 --> 00:51:01,260
that shit all the time.

1068
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:05,450
I've been accused of it myself but
I will tell you that is incorrect

1069
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:11,700
and that I think like in those Starsky
and Hutch movies like when someone would

1070
00:51:11,701 --> 00:51:16,590
say one or TV show or any any cop show
these to have to remember in the old days

1071
00:51:16,591 --> 00:51:19,270
like someone would say if you're a
copy of tell me like when someone's an

1072
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:20,213
undercover cop.

1073
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:22,530
Oh yeah and mirrors
like a secret password.

1074
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:22,970
Yeah.

1075
00:51:22,970 --> 00:51:24,480
You got to ask him Are you a cop.

1076
00:51:24,810 --> 00:51:25,540
I think Oh shit.

1077
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:26,190
Yeah I'm a cop.

1078
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:28,300
Yeah and I'm too smart for you Jack.

1079
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:29,430
You can't buy this heroin.

1080
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:34,440
You know there was like some magic word
I think that was a creation of fiction.

1081
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:35,760
Yeah yeah I think they changed that.

1082
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:36,923
Yeah

1083
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,070
but people always thought that.

1084
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:47,290
But you know that's that's probably some
disinformation the cops put out there.

1085
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:54,100
There was an accusation recently that
the DEA put out a false paper about them

1086
00:51:55,041 --> 00:51:59,810
not being able to track people by using
a message because I messages over the

1087
00:51:59,811 --> 00:52:00,644
Internet.

1088
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:04,250
And so there was like an article like
and I'm like a tech site like if you're

1089
00:52:04,251 --> 00:52:07,230
planning to sell drugs like
do it through I message why.

1090
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,380
Because the DEA says it can't read it.

1091
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:13,640
And then you know the DEA is pressuring
Apple but it turned out that was fake.

1092
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:17,480
There's like the DEA made that just
get a bunch of assholes that are drug

1093
00:52:17,481 --> 00:52:21,800
dealers you know your dog just I message
me I don't know what accent that is if

1094
00:52:21,801 --> 00:52:22,850
that's your nationality.

1095
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:23,750
I apologize.

1096
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:26,390
It was just a spur of the moment thing.

1097
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:32,020
I mean no disrespect but you know like
the DEA made a they put out fake news to

1098
00:52:34,101 --> 00:52:37,160
trick dummies into using
a message to sell drugs.

1099
00:52:37,890 --> 00:52:38,720
It's a good idea.

1100
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:42,290
It is it's very crafty but it's one of
those things where it gets to the point

1101
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:47,400
of you know when that's
not total entrapment.

1102
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:48,330
That's just lying.

1103
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:53,550
But what happens when you have undercover
people when you have undercover people

1104
00:52:53,551 --> 00:52:56,370
involved those undercover people sell
you coke and then you arrest them.

1105
00:52:56,730 --> 00:52:58,350
That's crazy.

1106
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:00,990
You know why it's crazy
because there's no real Coke.

1107
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:01,350
OK.

1108
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:03,150
You're not selling coke
you're arresting them.

1109
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:06,990
So you're saying that they wanted to
buy coke but you weren't even really

1110
00:53:06,991 --> 00:53:07,710
selling coke.

1111
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:11,400
You just got them to act through the
moments to get point and get out and talk

1112
00:53:11,401 --> 00:53:11,790
through it.

1113
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:12,900
There was no coke to buy.

1114
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:14,220
There's no crime to commit.

1115
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:17,580
They might have thought they were going
to commit a crime but there was no real

1116
00:53:17,581 --> 00:53:17,880
Coke.

1117
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:18,780
They're not really buying anything.

1118
00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:19,770
Not really selling anything.

1119
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,710
There was no real transaction
to fake transaction.

1120
00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:24,330
You're playing make believe.

1121
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:28,770
And that's fucked up because you're
also trying to arrest people because the

1122
00:53:28,771 --> 00:53:31,350
more b b arrest the
better your career looks.

1123
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:36,420
So it becomes a quantifiable thing so
you can talk someone into doing something

1124
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:38,040
illegal and then arrest them.

1125
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:39,450
And then it helps you.

1126
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:42,420
But that's crazy because people
talk people in the suck their dick.

1127
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:46,020
People talk people into doing all sorts
of stupid shit they didn't really want

1128
00:53:46,021 --> 00:53:46,770
to do.

1129
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:49,770
They just did because they got
persuaded people could be persuasive.

1130
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:54,030
So if you're some crazy sociopathic
Fuck that just so happens to be an

1131
00:53:54,031 --> 00:53:58,170
undercover cop and you want to talk
people into doing shit for you so you can

1132
00:53:58,171 --> 00:53:59,004
arrest them.

1133
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:01,650
We need to put you in a cage OK.

1134
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:04,510
You you crazy fuck yeah.

1135
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:05,190
Tony.

1136
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:05,370
Yeah.

1137
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:06,750
You saying I'm an undercover cop.

1138
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:07,380
No.

1139
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:08,700
How do you guys find out about that.

1140
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:14,060
Well the Internet is one of the first we
had to vet it but we just figured we'd

1141
00:54:15,061 --> 00:54:15,894
run it by first.

1142
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:16,743
See how you reacted.

1143
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:20,310
Well you know I have to tell you
once you bring it up it's true.

1144
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:21,330
I'm an undercover cop.

1145
00:54:21,610 --> 00:54:25,340
You know it's just the whole idea that
they can pretend to buy drugs from you

1146
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,180
and then arrest you.

1147
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,480
It's like what are you doing with it.

1148
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:28,523
Why did you go get it.

1149
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:29,640
Stop.

1150
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:30,210
Stop that.

1151
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:32,700
You're selling fake drugs
you're buying fakes drugs.

1152
00:54:32,850 --> 00:54:33,683
Stop it.

1153
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:35,130
Just cut the shit.

1154
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:36,540
Stop trying to trick people.

1155
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:37,070
OK.

1156
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:37,850
Easy catch me.

1157
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:40,440
Don't stop playing games
pretending you're criminals.

1158
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:41,963
If you catch me don't.

1159
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,140
Jesus Christ can we be everybody be
superhero superheroes dump tend to be

1160
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:50,970
undercover drug lords and sell your
fucking illegal guns then arrest you.

1161
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:52,860
Yeah I think with the drugs it's good.

1162
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:56,250
I think they should keep you on
that predator thing now the drone.

1163
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,180
No.

1164
00:54:57,180 --> 00:55:00,360
Get those guys to catch a predator like
bust and the guys that are trying to

1165
00:55:00,361 --> 00:55:01,530
hook up with kids and stuff.

1166
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:02,453
Oh yeah.

1167
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:03,320
That's different.

1168
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:05,000
Predator drones a couple of kids.

1169
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:05,850
Yeah.

1170
00:55:05,850 --> 00:55:06,570
But even that.

1171
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:07,530
You know what.

1172
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:11,280
Let's talk about that is like what
have you got like a really weak dude.

1173
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:15,900
And he's a pedophile and he's gone
through like you know counselling and he's

1174
00:55:15,901 --> 00:55:20,901
got like all this you know shit that's
heavy in his head but he's gonna figure

1175
00:55:21,661 --> 00:55:25,740
out a way to never abuse again like he
got out of jail and he's trying to go

1176
00:55:25,741 --> 00:55:29,820
through counselling he's
trying to straighten himself
out and then along comes

1177
00:55:29,821 --> 00:55:34,380
the fucking to catch a predator show
and they just troll his ass off.

1178
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:38,740
I don't know how they get people to
get into their site and chat with them.

1179
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:40,680
Shit like I don't know
what those people say back.

1180
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:42,390
I don't know what they
get to say back but.

1181
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:47,430
Well sometimes you know they have the kid
being extra teasing it is sort of like

1182
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:51,970
Hey there's a party plugged up I'm
having a party and making cookies.

1183
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:54,600
Can you bring some sweet tea.

1184
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:59,430
Although a sweet tea house was
sweet to southern most sweet tea.

1185
00:55:59,450 --> 00:56:00,480
Me too I suck dick.

1186
00:56:01,950 --> 00:56:05,490
There's there's there's some cookies
on the table I'll be right up and then

1187
00:56:05,491 --> 00:56:05,850
that.

1188
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:06,580
What's his name.

1189
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:07,413
Chris Hansen.

1190
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:08,880
Powerful Chris Hansen.

1191
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:10,290
How many crazy people that guy I met.

1192
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:12,630
Do they still do that or not show.

1193
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:13,770
I don't think so.

1194
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:15,690
I think they got in trouble I think.

1195
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:18,960
I don't see a lot of what they did.

1196
00:56:19,230 --> 00:56:23,430
First of all I think you have to get
people to sign releases to air that stuff.

1197
00:56:23,490 --> 00:56:25,590
I don't know how they got
anybody to sign a release.

1198
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:27,270
I mean I haven't really considered news.

1199
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:29,730
Maybe it's like look I don't know.

1200
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:31,110
I mean how did they do that.

1201
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:36,140
If you're audibly they probably cover
their costs their lawyers everything.

1202
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:37,883
What if they really.

1203
00:56:37,890 --> 00:56:38,460
Oh yeah.

1204
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:40,080
Because it's worth it to
them to have a helmet.

1205
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:44,040
We're just totally speculating all
of and you know better than anyone.

1206
00:56:44,310 --> 00:56:46,170
So why don't we look that up real quick.

1207
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:48,150
Let's see how to catch a predator.

1208
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:49,050
Many thanks to Google.

1209
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:50,190
How did you catch a predator.

1210
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:51,270
Get them sign waivers.

1211
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:51,840
Sure.

1212
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:53,160
Watch what what you Google man.

1213
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:54,640
You don't want that in your right.

1214
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:55,860
Yeah no kidding right.

1215
00:56:56,130 --> 00:56:58,140
Hey what was up with you
in the Google glasses man.

1216
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:58,550
I saw.

1217
00:56:58,550 --> 00:56:59,383
I'll tell you.

1218
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:00,893
Just call me honey.

1219
00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:01,910
Honey honey sweetie pie.

1220
00:57:03,150 --> 00:57:06,060
How did kids get them to sign waivers

1221
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:14,150
yeah you could get in trouble for like
looking too much into Catch predator like

1222
00:57:14,991 --> 00:57:18,150
what he tried to avoid being busted.

1223
00:57:18,430 --> 00:57:22,500
You know I was thinking about that the
other day like how do you even know

1224
00:57:22,770 --> 00:57:27,150
what's going on if you can't do certain
things like I was thinking of looking up

1225
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,380
like how to make a bomb.

1226
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:29,500
Just to see if that's out there.

1227
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,140
Like nobody knows if that's out there.

1228
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:33,810
If you don't google it and
everybody's afraid to google it.

1229
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:34,830
Makes sense.

1230
00:57:34,830 --> 00:57:35,160
Yeah.

1231
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:35,993
Yeah.

1232
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:36,690
Did you do it.

1233
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:37,530
No I didn't.

1234
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:39,570
I don't want anything to happen.

1235
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:42,570
Which is why I think I left an impression.

1236
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:43,470
You know something.

1237
00:57:43,470 --> 00:57:44,460
I was curious about.

1238
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:47,910
I wish there was a thing you could
google where it's like I don't know.

1239
00:57:48,450 --> 00:57:52,400
I just don't get it but it
seems like any crazy kid.

1240
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:53,503
I don't know

1241
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:55,560
the Internet's power.

1242
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:59,150
The scariest thing about shows like
catch predator is you see that these guys

1243
00:57:59,151 --> 00:58:03,320
are like broken you know you see they're
like horrified when they get caught.

1244
00:58:03,410 --> 00:58:05,000
You see they know that it's fucked up.

1245
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:10,300
It's not like these remorseless cold
insensitive unfeeling you know they're not

1246
00:58:11,151 --> 00:58:13,580
scared when they get caught
these guys fall apart.

1247
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:16,390
You see they're horrified at who they are.

1248
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:22,290
It's really it's scary scary to say
because it's like a glimpse into madness.

1249
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:24,540
You know that guy Chris Hansen.

1250
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:25,770
I guarantee you.

1251
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:31,370
Now this sounds like some hippie bullshit
but being around people that are that

1252
00:58:31,531 --> 00:58:36,531
fucked up on a regular basis
and broadcasting them and
paying your bills based

1253
00:58:39,331 --> 00:58:43,350
on broadcasting them and all and I mean
like under the guise I guess you're

1254
00:58:43,351 --> 00:58:45,570
pulling these people off the street
and that's always a good thing.

1255
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:47,400
Well you know what happened to him right.

1256
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:48,413
What was it.

1257
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:52,920
Was that he got caught cheating on his
wife or something I got some big media

1258
00:58:52,921 --> 00:58:53,390
thing.

1259
00:58:53,390 --> 00:58:55,020
Then he got investigated with a camera.

1260
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:56,620
He was out with another bomb.

1261
00:58:57,180 --> 00:58:57,420
Me.

1262
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:59,400
Look I don't know what the fuck
the guy's marriage was like.

1263
00:58:59,550 --> 00:59:00,383
You know I don't want to.

1264
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,100
Crack on the guy for that.

1265
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,200
I think there's a big
difference between that.

1266
00:59:04,770 --> 00:59:07,500
And you know of course you know some.

1267
00:59:08,310 --> 00:59:09,990
Pocket child some consensual.

1268
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,810
Shit he did with Secretary whoever.

1269
00:59:13,890 --> 00:59:14,723
That freak is.

1270
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:21,520
Oh I hate him for that but being around
all those people that were kid fuckers

1271
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:22,560
man.

1272
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:27,630
That's gonna wear on your soul that's
going to wear in your soul did you even

1273
00:59:27,631 --> 00:59:31,170
see these people over and over again and
being in their presence when you know

1274
00:59:31,590 --> 00:59:35,550
most of them are probably I mean I guess
this isn't their first time I would I

1275
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:39,270
would assume this isn't the first time
they probably already had sex with young

1276
00:59:39,271 --> 00:59:41,550
kids or any so you watch.

1277
00:59:41,710 --> 00:59:46,120
It's just it's it's just it's really
it's gonna be a really depressing view of

1278
00:59:46,121 --> 00:59:51,100
the world and it's only so many different
things you can expose yourself to in a

1279
00:59:51,101 --> 00:59:56,101
24 hour time period and you got you know
365 of those 24 hour time periods in a

1280
00:59:56,231 --> 00:59:59,380
year and you got a hundred of those
years if you keep your shit together but

1281
00:59:59,381 --> 01:00:00,250
most likely no.

1282
01:00:00,970 --> 01:00:04,660
And you're gonna spend time hanging
around pedophiles all the time.

1283
01:00:05,110 --> 01:00:08,350
And it's one thing if you're a guy and
that's your job pull them off the street.

1284
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:13,440
But I don't I'm not exactly sure what
good it does making a show out of that.

1285
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:17,800
You know I mean except scare the fuck
out of everybody and make us aware.

1286
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:23,440
But I feel like you know not that I mind
them being outed because it's such a

1287
01:00:23,441 --> 01:00:25,690
heinous crime against humanity.

1288
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,033
But

1289
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,550
man it seems like a fucked
up thing to broadcast.

1290
01:00:30,730 --> 01:00:32,530
You know it's like what do
we want to concentrate on.

1291
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:36,400
It's one thing to like work on cleaning
that up but as a piece of entertainment

1292
01:00:36,401 --> 01:00:40,450
programming you're gonna you're going
to concentrate on someone who wants to

1293
01:00:40,451 --> 01:00:43,060
victimize children and you're
just gonna focus on that a lot.

1294
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:46,390
I think it was a hit because you
know they're the ultimate bad guys.

1295
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:49,350
Well you know you're looking at
the villain of all villains right.

1296
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:51,130
No matter how fucked up
your own life is right.

1297
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:51,870
Right.

1298
01:00:51,870 --> 01:00:52,140
Yeah.

1299
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:54,130
Nobody's lower than a child molester.

1300
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:59,040
Everybody can go that fuckin piece of
shit that fuckin p has to be on the couch

1301
01:00:59,050 --> 01:01:00,400
picking your fat toes.

1302
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:01,780
Smoking a cigarette.

1303
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:05,500
You see they're just picking dry skin
and your toes and just drop it on the

1304
01:01:05,501 --> 01:01:07,340
floor of this motherfucker.

1305
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:10,960
That piece of shit I hope he
writes I hope he writes in jail.

1306
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:12,970
Death is too good for him.

1307
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:13,990
I hope he rot in jail.

1308
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:15,730
You know what they do to child molesters.

1309
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:21,000
They get him in their persons fucking
wretched stupid human being is barely an

1310
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:22,533
ape.

1311
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:25,000
They get the shit on this
child molester and feel better.

1312
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:27,510
That voice grosses me
out the bastard later.

1313
01:01:28,630 --> 01:01:32,350
I feel bad I and do it from Boston and
Boston is in a bad position right now.

1314
01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:38,870
Oh just don't you know this Boston thing.

1315
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:43,900
When one of the things that is fascinating
is that they like there was a thing

1316
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:48,440
about how they weren't going
to read him his rights and then

1317
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:55,030
this you know this thing about how whether
or not they were going to try him as

1318
01:01:55,031 --> 01:01:58,090
an enemy combatant or
try him as a civilian.

1319
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:01,930
It's really fascinating that
that's becoming like a real issue.

1320
01:02:02,370 --> 01:02:06,270
You know the way they decide to approach
it like is this guy an American that

1321
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:10,660
we're gonna try as an American you know
or someone who lets someone when someone

1322
01:02:10,661 --> 01:02:11,980
commits any form of terrorism.

1323
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:15,160
Are they are they instantly
just out of the club.

1324
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:17,570
Or do we try him as one of us you know.

1325
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:19,070
Is it or is it a war thing.

1326
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:19,943
Are we at war.

1327
01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:21,970
How we gonna how we're
going to go forward in this

1328
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:24,600
Yeah it's interesting.

1329
01:02:24,770 --> 01:02:27,480
It's once it's interesting
the way we label things.

1330
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:30,120
You know and it's interesting.

1331
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:31,920
OK.

1332
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:36,920
Any conspiracy theory aside that all these
nutty ideas that are floating around.

1333
01:02:37,470 --> 01:02:38,820
One thing we know for sure

1334
01:02:40,770 --> 01:02:45,050
there was bombs that a person put in
place that killed a bunch of people that

1335
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:45,940
didn't do anything wrong.

1336
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:52,060
And we have to figure out how the fuck
that happens and I know that sounds super

1337
01:02:52,531 --> 01:02:57,531
simplistic but as a human as a species
that's evolving clearly as we were

1338
01:02:59,731 --> 01:03:03,420
talking about the Mongols earlier and
like what they used to do a thousand years

1339
01:03:03,421 --> 01:03:08,421
ago like our most heinous acts pale in
comparison to those of our ancestors.

1340
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:15,500
But when something like this happens you
realize that people are still capable

1341
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:21,920
of such embarrassing ruthless
stupidity arrogance and just horrific

1342
01:03:28,150 --> 01:03:30,820
insensitivity towards their fellow man.

1343
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:35,750
The idea that you could just take a bunch
of people you don't know and kill them

1344
01:03:35,751 --> 01:03:39,570
and maim home and just you just were in
the wrong spot at the wrong time and I

1345
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:44,200
got a message and there's only one thing
that gets people to do that Fox by the

1346
01:03:44,201 --> 01:03:48,010
way and that's an ideology right.

1347
01:03:48,130 --> 01:03:50,630
It could either be a
religion or could be a cult.

1348
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:55,000
Or it can be you know some group that
you belong to that sworn allegiance to a

1349
01:03:55,001 --> 01:03:57,010
certain code or set of rules.

1350
01:03:57,530 --> 01:04:00,970
But that's the only way you get people
to do shit like that if they don't have

1351
01:04:00,971 --> 01:04:01,690
an ideology.

1352
01:04:01,690 --> 01:04:02,830
They just don't do that.

1353
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:04,150
Doesn't make sense.

1354
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:09,510
There's no evolutionary benefit to doing
that other than pleasing a group of

1355
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:14,360
other like minded psychopaths
someone you have to be

1356
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:20,960
amongst a group of people that have very
specific beliefs that above all else

1357
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:24,493
take precedent.

1358
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:29,750
So that you're willing to put your
humanity aside for your crazy beliefs in a

1359
01:04:29,751 --> 01:04:34,751
completely irrational display of
destructive power and that you can kill

1360
01:04:35,901 --> 01:04:36,734
innocents.

1361
01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:40,700
That only comes from ideology
and we get really lost.

1362
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:46,960
When we start talking about religious
freedom and religion and you know an

1363
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:51,950
atheists are guilty of this just as much
as really religious people are because

1364
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:57,520
whether you call it being a Muslim whether
you call it being a Buddhist whether

1365
01:04:57,651 --> 01:05:01,760
you call it being a vegan whether you
call it being a Christian whether you call

1366
01:05:01,761 --> 01:05:05,810
it being a Republican whether you call
it being a Democrat whether you call it

1367
01:05:05,811 --> 01:05:10,811
being a progressive when you lock
yourself in anything you become a part of

1368
01:05:14,951 --> 01:05:17,630
something that's almost
been decided for you.

1369
01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:23,090
You you you you you lock
into a pre arranged set of
opinions on things and some

1370
01:05:26,081 --> 01:05:31,081
of them are bat shit fucking crazy and
just like the Mongols got a hundred

1371
01:05:32,111 --> 01:05:37,111
thousand mother fuckers to roam across
Russia and Europe and China and slaughter

1372
01:05:38,741 --> 01:05:39,880
millions of people.

1373
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:44,890
You can't do that unless you've got a
cause you can't do that unless you're part

1374
01:05:44,891 --> 01:05:45,724
of a group.

1375
01:05:45,730 --> 01:05:48,940
You can't do that unless your group
is separate from the other groups.

1376
01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:53,050
And the only way that ever works is
someone's got to talk you into that shit.

1377
01:05:53,530 --> 01:05:54,760
You've got to be a part of something.

1378
01:05:54,810 --> 01:05:59,440
And with this kid apparently was or he
was you know the one they're saying did

1379
01:05:59,441 --> 01:06:02,800
it he was a pretty radical
religious young man.

1380
01:06:03,550 --> 01:06:04,720
Now whether or not that's true.

1381
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:05,673
Who knows science.

1382
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:09,520
It has to be it seems to be the one thing
that all these people have in common.

1383
01:06:09,790 --> 01:06:14,790
Yeah well I think the false flag people
are thinking that like somebody gave

1384
01:06:14,921 --> 01:06:18,970
them all this stuff and that they were
talked into doing it and then it was a

1385
01:06:18,971 --> 01:06:23,200
plan to erode civil liberties that they
would sacrifice a few Americans and

1386
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:24,680
clamp down on laws.

1387
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:28,930
And this is this really is classically
what military leaders have been doing

1388
01:06:28,931 --> 01:06:30,040
since the beginning of time.

1389
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:33,850
You know like we're talking about armies
in the past would actually sacrifice

1390
01:06:33,851 --> 01:06:37,840
soldiers and slaughter them so that the
rest of the people could eat you know

1391
01:06:37,841 --> 01:06:39,280
they would cannibalize themselves.

1392
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:40,120
That was they.

1393
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:42,290
They had to talk somebody into
doing something like that.

1394
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:43,750
You know I mean

1395
01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:48,480
the first time somebody says
that's super awkward Yeah.

1396
01:06:49,270 --> 01:06:54,270
It's fuckin you know it's hard to believe
that in this day and age with the like

1397
01:06:55,691 --> 01:06:59,890
if you look at like how amazing
humans are capable of being you know.

1398
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:05,550
Like here's a perfect example Oprah now
I know Brian doesn't like my love for

1399
01:07:07,501 --> 01:07:08,334
Oprah.

1400
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:11,300
I love that you're I
Oprah I think it's Brian.

1401
01:07:12,370 --> 01:07:17,370
He goofs on me but it's
an honest appreciation for
what she does because Oprah

1402
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:23,040
like you know I have a friend who worked
for and is like man she's like super

1403
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:25,710
yuppie bitch.

1404
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:29,150
Barely an hour and how the fuck are you
going to try to be a standup comedian

1405
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:31,300
you can't even go two
hours without paying.

1406
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:34,150
My friend was like he worked
for and he was like pow.

1407
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:35,410
She's like intense you know.

1408
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:36,570
You know she's like really.

1409
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:41,550
She has an idea what she wants and she
gets done and you know he was like I

1410
01:07:41,551 --> 01:07:45,210
think he's been intimidated by too because
he was working for but like stop and

1411
01:07:45,211 --> 01:07:50,211
think about how much nice that lady
does like that lady is like so nice.

1412
01:07:50,630 --> 01:07:53,070
All those women that come
to her show they feel great.

1413
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:54,750
Everybody leaves positive.

1414
01:07:55,560 --> 01:08:00,360
I was reading this thing the other day
on negative energy and that there was

1415
01:08:00,361 --> 01:08:03,300
some sort of a study that actually showed
that negative energy is contagious.

1416
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:07,110
If you find out you know if you if
you're hanging around people that are

1417
01:08:07,111 --> 01:08:11,010
negative it doesn't just affect you when
you communicate with them and becomes a

1418
01:08:11,011 --> 01:08:12,720
part of the way you communicate as well.

1419
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:16,860
It becomes contagious and one like super
aggressive contagious negative person

1420
01:08:16,861 --> 01:08:18,480
can actually infect like a company.

1421
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:24,020
I think that's why it's important that I
mean companies have been really focused

1422
01:08:24,151 --> 01:08:24,780
on that.

1423
01:08:24,780 --> 01:08:27,990
I think ones that are really aware
of the social structure within the

1424
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:33,000
organization they want to make sure that
you don't get like a really negative

1425
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:37,810
Downer type person in any sort of a role
because if you get them you know that

1426
01:08:37,811 --> 01:08:39,210
they can really infect.

1427
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:42,300
Like if they're especially if you had
some guy like you work on a big project

1428
01:08:42,310 --> 01:08:45,550
you got some one guy who's leading and
he's a douche bag and everybody shows up

1429
01:08:45,570 --> 01:08:50,570
work like oh it's there's very few things
in life worse than being stuck like

1430
01:08:51,571 --> 01:08:54,510
working in a job it sucks
with a boss who's an asshole.

1431
01:08:54,670 --> 01:08:55,260
Right.

1432
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:59,280
Why do why are all bosses mostly
assholes to me making my list.

1433
01:08:59,310 --> 01:09:04,310
I look back at all the jobs I've ever
had you know and it's the majority like

1434
01:09:04,590 --> 01:09:07,650
they were always the assholes they were
never the people you hung out with or

1435
01:09:07,651 --> 01:09:10,860
wanted to hang out with you know they're
always there I was always a terrible

1436
01:09:10,861 --> 01:09:11,400
employee.

1437
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:15,540
So I think anytime a boss got
mad at me I totally deserved it.

1438
01:09:15,690 --> 01:09:16,740
There was a shitty.

1439
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:22,100
I did a shit job mowing lawns when
I was a you know a lot landscaper.

1440
01:09:23,550 --> 01:09:28,320
I remember the guy hired me to fuckin
scalped this law and I did not work a lot

1441
01:09:28,321 --> 01:09:29,040
more.

1442
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:31,080
I lied just like you get
the job like my friend did.

1443
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:34,170
And you said you could do it easy so
often it's not hard but it was hard.

1444
01:09:34,190 --> 01:09:36,030
The first time I did it was
kind of hard to figure out.

1445
01:09:36,270 --> 01:09:39,930
These are old shitty lawnmowers you
know and I sculpt the shit out his lawn.

1446
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:42,360
You fucking hate most don't you hate it.

1447
01:09:43,070 --> 01:09:44,220
That used to be torture.

1448
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:45,780
It's not it's it's not easy.

1449
01:09:45,930 --> 01:09:50,040
Oh yeah but when I was in high school my
friend Chris he one of the things about

1450
01:09:50,041 --> 01:09:51,990
Boston about growing up in Boston.

1451
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:54,930
Boston is like a really in G.

1452
01:09:55,410 --> 01:09:56,820
They have a lot of ingenuity.

1453
01:09:57,090 --> 01:09:59,280
There's a lot of like
people get shit done.

1454
01:09:59,390 --> 01:10:01,440
So like it's a strong work ethic.

1455
01:10:01,470 --> 01:10:05,940
They're like clearly way stronger work
ethic than I ever experienced here in

1456
01:10:05,941 --> 01:10:06,570
California.

1457
01:10:06,570 --> 01:10:09,990
Like people are so used to getting up
in the morning shoveling their car out

1458
01:10:09,991 --> 01:10:14,991
from the snow they're used to shit like
it's a different kind of like there's a

1459
01:10:17,531 --> 01:10:19,180
different kind of like mentality there.

1460
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:22,840
You know if you grow up there you go
and figure out what we're talking about.

1461
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:28,020
I had an example where we talked
about just before that Boston yes fuck

1462
01:10:31,850 --> 01:10:36,850
I had a point and I completely lost
it and trying to figure out why it is

1463
01:10:40,940 --> 01:10:41,410
S.A.

1464
01:10:41,410 --> 01:10:42,243
after burying it.

1465
01:10:42,330 --> 01:10:43,100
I didn't.

1466
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:44,850
I took it but not until
right before the show.

1467
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:48,370
Fuck mowing lawns.

1468
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:49,953
Oprah.

1469
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:51,670
No no no I was passed over dude.

1470
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:54,970
It was the the mowing lawns
things about oh my friend Chris.

1471
01:10:55,270 --> 01:10:55,870
Okay.

1472
01:10:55,870 --> 01:11:00,130
When I was in high school this is what
it was when everybody else was like you

1473
01:11:00,131 --> 01:11:04,890
know I had a job like Poppa Gino's and
shit I was like making spaghetti and I

1474
01:11:04,891 --> 01:11:06,850
was like pretty easy boring job.

1475
01:11:07,090 --> 01:11:09,850
This kid had a lawn mower empire.

1476
01:11:10,450 --> 01:11:12,760
He had a landscaping empire.

1477
01:11:12,790 --> 01:11:14,110
He had a brand new car.

1478
01:11:14,410 --> 01:11:15,880
He had people working for him.

1479
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:18,650
He had lawns that were going
while he was at school.

1480
01:11:18,670 --> 01:11:19,710
He had guys working farm.

1481
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:23,530
They were cutting lawns wise at school
and he would come home and he would go

1482
01:11:23,531 --> 01:11:26,650
and work till nighttime and they'd
show up for work the next day.

1483
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:28,030
He always have new sneakers on.

1484
01:11:28,270 --> 01:11:29,620
He was like a grown man.

1485
01:11:29,650 --> 01:11:34,650
By the time we were 17 this fucking kid
I had never been around more people.

1486
01:11:34,750 --> 01:11:36,700
That made me feel like a lazy bitch.

1487
01:11:37,270 --> 01:11:40,720
There was so many dudes like my friend
Jimmy that I used to love Jimmy to tell

1488
01:11:40,721 --> 01:11:41,740
yo this guy.

1489
01:11:41,820 --> 01:11:45,340
Like he had from the time he was in
high school he had his own electrical

1490
01:11:45,341 --> 01:11:46,030
business.

1491
01:11:46,030 --> 01:11:47,410
He worked for a guy for a little while.

1492
01:11:47,590 --> 01:11:51,160
Started doing work on the same time he
got at a high school just got his own

1493
01:11:51,161 --> 01:11:56,080
business bus and asked 10 12 hours a
day drive it all out ran like a maniac.

1494
01:11:56,520 --> 01:12:01,520
It was you while you're around people
like that like you you develop that sort

1495
01:12:01,691 --> 01:12:04,860
of you know that sort
of tenacity that exists.

1496
01:12:04,930 --> 01:12:08,100
Like not a lot of spots
in this country you know.

1497
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:12,310
And I think that dealing with like
environmental conditions there's something

1498
01:12:12,311 --> 01:12:13,144
about that.

1499
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:15,340
It's why people from New
York tend to be funnier.

1500
01:12:15,790 --> 01:12:19,270
You know people from Boston tend to be
funnier because they're dealing with so

1501
01:12:19,271 --> 01:12:20,440
much bullshit all the time.

1502
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:22,410
Definitely and controls.

1503
01:12:24,330 --> 01:12:28,240
I definitely think where you're coming
up with that raised has a lot to do with

1504
01:12:28,241 --> 01:12:32,650
that type of crazy factor of
your communication skills really.

1505
01:12:32,670 --> 01:12:36,340
I think it's down to like you know
small talk if it's the city that you're

1506
01:12:36,341 --> 01:12:37,120
raised in.

1507
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:38,080
It rains a lot.

1508
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:42,220
You're going to end up having to talk
with your friends more or if it snows a

1509
01:12:42,221 --> 01:12:44,290
lot if it rains a lot
if it's a windy city.

1510
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:45,153
Things like that.

1511
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:46,090
It's true.

1512
01:12:46,090 --> 01:12:48,070
And I think to be indoors or really apply.

1513
01:12:48,790 --> 01:12:49,240
Yeah.

1514
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:50,200
Socially for sure.

1515
01:12:50,230 --> 01:12:51,063
Right yeah.

1516
01:12:51,130 --> 01:12:53,470
In California you could
sleep outside and live right.

1517
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:55,850
I drank I drank.

1518
01:12:56,830 --> 01:13:00,410
Tom Hardy didn't talk on the
porch was smoking cigarettes.

1519
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:04,900
That's a Don't you think that Ohio of
today growing up in the same place where

1520
01:13:04,901 --> 01:13:08,200
you grew up would be very
different because the Internet
because kids growing up

1521
01:13:08,201 --> 01:13:10,420
with the Internet be a lot more tolerable.

1522
01:13:10,450 --> 01:13:11,140
That's for sure.

1523
01:13:11,140 --> 01:13:11,700
Yeah right.

1524
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:12,090
Yeah.

1525
01:13:12,090 --> 01:13:12,880
Yeah.

1526
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:14,570
That's a totally different world now.

1527
01:13:14,710 --> 01:13:18,430
The whole world also got lights turned
on everywhere lights turned on and the

1528
01:13:18,431 --> 01:13:22,630
news started showing up
all the information started
flowing whereas before you

1529
01:13:22,631 --> 01:13:25,690
relied on local newspapers
and fuckin TV news.

1530
01:13:25,730 --> 01:13:30,290
Bitch how the fuck did you know what was
going on anybody know what was going on

1531
01:13:30,490 --> 01:13:31,840
then man.

1532
01:13:33,970 --> 01:13:35,260
How did anybody know.

1533
01:13:36,460 --> 01:13:40,690
So I think they're saying that there's
like certain laws that apply to

1534
01:13:40,691 --> 01:13:41,320
pedophiles.

1535
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:43,280
That's why these guys were
allowed to be put on that show.

1536
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:45,000
And there's a reason why they quit.

1537
01:13:45,370 --> 01:13:47,160
The guy killed himself while filming it.

1538
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:50,590
One of the suspects somebody tweeted.

1539
01:13:50,950 --> 01:13:54,040
Well if they were being honest
when they say good riddance.

1540
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:55,150
See you next week.

1541
01:13:55,220 --> 01:13:56,053
Yeah.

1542
01:13:56,290 --> 01:13:57,123
Show it.

1543
01:13:57,220 --> 01:13:59,710
I mean are they trying to get rid of
predators and trying to catch him.

1544
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:00,220
It's not.

1545
01:14:00,220 --> 01:14:01,600
It's bad if they commit suicide.

1546
01:14:01,990 --> 01:14:05,650
Well we're all God's creatures
even the ones that fuck kids.

1547
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:08,920
What I mean what is that.

1548
01:14:09,010 --> 01:14:09,843
That's ridiculous.

1549
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:13,180
Well they got sued for one
hundred and five million dollars.

1550
01:14:13,270 --> 01:14:17,700
Why don't they just come clean and give
the guys have gone on the show and go

1551
01:14:17,710 --> 01:14:20,860
listen sir there's a bullet in
that gun put it up to your head.

1552
01:14:21,010 --> 01:14:21,850
Fuck this trial.

1553
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:24,730
And that would be we'll
pay for your funeral.

1554
01:14:26,530 --> 01:14:29,600
Well you know they'd be
the most watched reality.

1555
01:14:29,690 --> 01:14:31,790
And then as soon as he
blows his brains I go sigh.

1556
01:14:32,980 --> 01:14:33,813
Film it.

1557
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,120
Get a close up on him or we're out.

1558
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:37,800
Get out of there.

1559
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:38,633
Just leave him there.

1560
01:14:39,310 --> 01:14:40,660
Put it on TV no one's gonna know.

1561
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:46,480
What are they gonna do.

1562
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,040
They are the cops gonna sue NBC.

1563
01:14:48,790 --> 01:14:49,990
They're gonna bring
him in for questioning.

1564
01:14:50,010 --> 01:14:51,010
Look you saw what happened.

1565
01:14:51,490 --> 01:14:52,840
God fucks kids we gave him a gun.

1566
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:53,500
Okay we're cool.

1567
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:54,600
We're good here right here.

1568
01:14:55,720 --> 01:15:00,720
Would that be illegal I would say yes
especially if the guy didn't have a gun

1569
01:15:00,811 --> 01:15:01,350
permit.

1570
01:15:01,350 --> 01:15:03,790
Yeah I guess it really
depends on the gun law.

1571
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:07,650
Yeah well maybe you could do it if you
gave me a gun and said Whatever you do do

1572
01:15:07,651 --> 01:15:10,620
not shoot yourself in
the head right now on TV.

1573
01:15:14,430 --> 01:15:16,800
You will smile a wink huh.

1574
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:21,710
There was this weird comic at
the at the store last night.

1575
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:22,820
Do you remember this Tony.

1576
01:15:23,330 --> 01:15:28,100
There was some Norwegian comic that I
did something about Michael Jackson or

1577
01:15:28,101 --> 01:15:28,640
something.

1578
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:33,260
But he had this huge Wikipedia that just
goes off about how brilliant this guy

1579
01:15:33,261 --> 01:15:36,510
is and how much money how did he
write his own Wikipedia is with me.

1580
01:15:36,570 --> 01:15:39,300
But I mean he is connected to it like
a lot of these TV shows and stuff.

1581
01:15:39,350 --> 01:15:44,350
But anyways his wife comes up to me
goes Hey Fat Man come you fat man.

1582
01:15:45,330 --> 01:15:47,620
And I was right in front of my target.

1583
01:15:48,970 --> 01:15:51,630
And she was trying to tell
me that she wanted that.

1584
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:55,130
That he has a nice house up here and he
pretty much she was trying to get me to

1585
01:15:55,131 --> 01:15:59,510
come back to them how their house for an
origin for what it seemed like and she

1586
01:15:59,511 --> 01:15:59,960
wanted you.

1587
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:02,350
Well it's probably what they feel
like Hollywood's about right.

1588
01:16:02,390 --> 01:16:02,690
Yeah.

1589
01:16:02,690 --> 01:16:06,260
And he's like if I am going to make
it here you have to give up the pussy.

1590
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:09,140
Listen we need orgies all of the time.

1591
01:16:09,620 --> 01:16:12,380
Norway only way to make
it as comedians so weird.

1592
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:14,870
Yeah that's that's a pretty
odd story there fellow.

1593
01:16:15,050 --> 01:16:17,690
And then and then she's showing
me these photos and her phone.

1594
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:19,590
She's like look at the parties we have.

1595
01:16:19,610 --> 01:16:24,050
And it's just like her and this other
girl like know women she's a comedian.

1596
01:16:24,150 --> 01:16:27,770
No no no she's the wife of the one she's
just like going around the whole place

1597
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:30,140
like bragging about her
husband how many million.

1598
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:34,670
Yeah she was she was very cute but this
guy looked like a bear and you know he's

1599
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:38,570
a bigger guy with a suit that's like
four sizes too small we're probably both

1600
01:16:38,571 --> 01:16:42,830
CIA guys you got slowly worked there
is slowly gonna make it into the

1601
01:16:42,831 --> 01:16:43,710
organization.

1602
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:46,070
DAVE There were looking into
this whole death squad thing.

1603
01:16:46,790 --> 01:16:49,670
You know like with his death
squad we have to worry about them.

1604
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:51,920
We'll see.

1605
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:54,920
See you you're the guy that they
wanted to take up there and show them.

1606
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:55,380
Yeah.

1607
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:55,910
Sure.

1608
01:16:55,910 --> 01:17:00,110
You're going to drug you and hit
you with some fucking some hypnosis.

1609
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:03,620
Europeans just they just
don't have like normal sex.

1610
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:06,920
He's going to be some Manchurian
Candidate type 2 that's going to happen.

1611
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:09,870
CIA do is going to drop
a nano pill in his drink.

1612
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:11,330
That's silly bitch.

1613
01:17:11,330 --> 01:17:12,010
He'll be hammered.

1614
01:17:12,010 --> 01:17:13,370
He'll drink anything to send his way.

1615
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:17,630
You know with all the waiters that lady
that drives around in that pink Corvette

1616
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:18,720
that's all yesterday.

1617
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:22,010
This was my night Yes
sir excuse me last week.

1618
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:26,420
This was my point that I see her maybe
once a week and it's always random places

1619
01:17:26,421 --> 01:17:29,090
like I'll see her in Hollywood
once I hear a lot around here.

1620
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:32,690
But like that you just need
to tell people what she is.

1621
01:17:32,990 --> 01:17:37,990
She used to be like a rich wife I
guess that would post photos or these

1622
01:17:38,121 --> 01:17:39,990
billboards like all over.

1623
01:17:40,010 --> 01:17:43,040
Just kind of promoting her and
I don't think she really had.

1624
01:17:43,090 --> 01:17:44,050
Well that's one way to describe.

1625
01:17:44,110 --> 01:17:44,480
Yeah.

1626
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:46,020
I don't think she really
had anything going.

1627
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:49,940
She just had a lot of money to play with
and so she pretty much made her seem

1628
01:17:49,941 --> 01:17:53,240
like she was a big deal when she
really wasn't used as a rich wife.

1629
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:55,290
Yeah well the billboards
were these giant billboards.

1630
01:17:55,340 --> 01:17:58,850
See Angelina on them in like big
letters like whoa it's Angelina.

1631
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:01,760
And she's this really
pale lady with giant tits.

1632
01:18:01,870 --> 01:18:05,640
Yeah and she looks a little
odd like she looks like.

1633
01:18:05,660 --> 01:18:07,730
Like really like photo shopped.

1634
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:12,260
Like really like brightly lit like it's
really hard to discern like key features

1635
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:15,230
because she's apparently she's very old.

1636
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:17,390
And when I came to L.A.

1637
01:18:17,391 --> 01:18:20,180
in 94 she had big
billboards all around town.

1638
01:18:20,210 --> 01:18:23,630
Like several of them that said
Angelina it was just her and then her

1639
01:18:23,631 --> 01:18:24,520
management's number.

1640
01:18:24,620 --> 01:18:25,970
It was her in her underwear.

1641
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:26,973
It was really high.

1642
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:30,240
Yeah it was kind of crazy
because you know she was.

1643
01:18:30,260 --> 01:18:32,420
She had a really nice body I guess.

1644
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:32,750
Yeah.

1645
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:33,440
Back in the day.

1646
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:33,930
I do that.

1647
01:18:33,930 --> 01:18:34,250
Yeah.

1648
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:35,083
And that's like.

1649
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:36,613
What's her face.

1650
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:38,173
Dolly Parton.

1651
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:38,750
Yeah.

1652
01:18:38,750 --> 01:18:41,990
But by the time she was doing this I
mean who knows how old she was in that

1653
01:18:41,991 --> 01:18:46,991
picture but the the one that you
see today bears no resemblance.

1654
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:48,980
Yeah.

1655
01:18:48,980 --> 01:18:50,750
I had no idea who she was.

1656
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:55,490
And we were shooting something
at Hollywood Highland
one night and that crazy

1657
01:18:55,491 --> 01:19:00,491
like area and all of a sudden she
pulls up and people were like Oh my God

1658
01:19:00,590 --> 01:19:01,670
there's Angelina.

1659
01:19:01,890 --> 01:19:06,890
And it took I had no idea who this
was and it took it like four people 20

1660
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:10,910
minutes to be able to explain to
me what the big thing was there.

1661
01:19:11,270 --> 01:19:12,640
Well I think she's in L.A.

1662
01:19:12,650 --> 01:19:13,483
she's like a..

1663
01:19:14,050 --> 01:19:14,750
Like an icon.

1664
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:17,330
Yeah she's probably 60 years old at least.

1665
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:19,560
She still dresses like she's like 75.

1666
01:19:19,610 --> 01:19:20,450
I've seen her several.

1667
01:19:20,510 --> 01:19:23,450
I wonder what she wanted if she
wanted to be an actress or like what.

1668
01:19:23,870 --> 01:19:25,340
Oh that's a good question.

1669
01:19:25,370 --> 01:19:26,940
Interesting marketing campaign.

1670
01:19:27,110 --> 01:19:30,650
But what's really weird is is
that how much I sear and jump in.

1671
01:19:30,770 --> 01:19:33,510
That's like one of the only cars
where you're like Oh that's her.

1672
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:34,070
That's her.

1673
01:19:34,070 --> 01:19:34,903
That's her.

1674
01:19:35,210 --> 01:19:39,140
Like how many times you actually drive
by people you probably know right and

1675
01:19:39,530 --> 01:19:40,830
drive around the same cars.

1676
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:43,760
It's just so weird how small
Los Angeles actually is.

1677
01:19:43,930 --> 01:19:47,170
At that point you will in that sense and
you know it's also like the spots that

1678
01:19:47,171 --> 01:19:50,650
she hits the spots you're at like I
said I just saw the coffee being there.

1679
01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:52,120
That's what she looks like now.

1680
01:19:52,230 --> 01:19:55,620
Yeah yeah yeah man.

1681
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:57,153
All right.

1682
01:19:57,470 --> 01:19:58,460
I'm sure she's a nice lady.

1683
01:19:58,540 --> 01:20:02,480
I mean you know I don't know
hate but you wouldn't do that.

1684
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:03,920
No I mean look man.

1685
01:20:04,130 --> 01:20:08,750
Nothing wrong with being that you
know that's who she is she's fabulous.

1686
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:10,893
Let her go get it.

1687
01:20:10,910 --> 01:20:11,743
Fuck this look.

1688
01:20:12,130 --> 01:20:14,030
Look that Brian put that away

1689
01:20:15,830 --> 01:20:17,060
all the way.

1690
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:20,720
She's your grandmother man.

1691
01:20:20,750 --> 01:20:21,650
Show some respect.

1692
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:26,390
I don't know if she's a mother or a
grandmother but you know that that whole

1693
01:20:26,391 --> 01:20:29,150
wanting to be famous
thing is a strange thing.

1694
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,400
She was like one of the
original reality stars.

1695
01:20:31,490 --> 01:20:34,580
She created her own reality show
by just putting up billboards.

1696
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:39,890
A reality show became her life you know
no one was filming it but her life was a

1697
01:20:39,891 --> 01:20:40,670
reality show.

1698
01:20:40,670 --> 01:20:44,360
You know I know she was I knew she was
a couple of years after living here.

1699
01:20:44,390 --> 01:20:48,500
So I've known who she
was since 96 ish 97 ish.

1700
01:20:49,590 --> 01:20:50,423
Wow.

1701
01:20:52,050 --> 01:20:55,400
I remember when she pulled up she had
her face covered with like some kind of

1702
01:20:55,401 --> 01:20:57,130
like one of those Asian aliens.

1703
01:20:57,370 --> 01:20:58,220
Yeah and shoot.

1704
01:20:58,340 --> 01:20:59,360
She was mysterious.

1705
01:20:59,420 --> 01:21:00,860
Yeah well

1706
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:02,960
yeah.

1707
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:07,200
That's uh that's a strange strange
world we live in my friends man.

1708
01:21:07,290 --> 01:21:11,100
If I was a porn star hot chick porn star
I would buy a pink Corvette and be her

1709
01:21:11,101 --> 01:21:11,940
new competition.

1710
01:21:12,270 --> 01:21:13,110
I'd be so rude.

1711
01:21:14,430 --> 01:21:15,810
You can call yourself Anzalone.

1712
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:18,530
Yeah or Angelina.

1713
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:21,000
That's a good idea though because I
mean that's how she got her attention to

1714
01:21:21,010 --> 01:21:25,290
seeing that you know pink Corvette the
money girl Angelina maybe you could have

1715
01:21:25,291 --> 01:21:30,291
like your whole thing was about like how
you get a rich husband who allows you

1716
01:21:31,651 --> 01:21:35,830
to freelance in your porn career and that
you know that will be the whole thing.

1717
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:38,130
So the husband has no idea
what's going on he comes home.

1718
01:21:38,190 --> 01:21:39,690
What is happening in here.

1719
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:40,950
Who are these guys.

1720
01:21:42,210 --> 01:21:47,210
And you explain while they were tag team
and you I'm got to say you know it was

1721
01:21:48,470 --> 01:21:50,660
all so I could get better with you honey

1722
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:52,730
I just.

1723
01:21:52,730 --> 01:21:54,720
They're they're not tag team me.

1724
01:21:54,770 --> 01:21:58,530
They're teaching me this
is it's very controversial.

1725
01:21:59,580 --> 01:22:00,413
I should been.

1726
01:22:01,430 --> 01:22:02,520
Not going anywhere.

1727
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:07,180
Have you ever been with a girl that
you're just completely haunted about like

1728
01:22:07,220 --> 01:22:10,980
that you think about like even after it
happened it was like Why the fuck did I

1729
01:22:10,981 --> 01:22:11,730
do that.

1730
01:22:11,730 --> 01:22:12,960
That's part of being truck son.

1731
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:15,300
That's a whole part of being drunk.

1732
01:22:15,810 --> 01:22:16,740
That's a beauty of life.

1733
01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:20,040
If you didn't have those stories then
you wouldn't have those awkward moments.

1734
01:22:20,450 --> 01:22:23,040
And if you didn't have those awkward
moments you wouldn't have some really

1735
01:22:23,041 --> 01:22:25,880
hilarious shit to talk about when
everyone else is drunk as well.

1736
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:27,780
I can understand what you're saying here.

1737
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:30,780
That's what drunks have the best stories.

1738
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:35,310
The being drunk drunk stories when they
could just really cut loose and be free

1739
01:22:35,311 --> 01:22:36,240
and not worried about it.

1740
01:22:36,870 --> 01:22:40,440
I have friends from back in the Boston
days of the best stories when they're

1741
01:22:40,441 --> 01:22:43,980
drunk and then somewhere along the line
those folks become alcoholics anonymous

1742
01:22:43,981 --> 01:22:46,500
people and all the stories stop.

1743
01:22:47,070 --> 01:22:47,903
Yeah.

1744
01:22:47,910 --> 01:22:50,660
I feel like I'm going to start getting
into alcoholics anonymous soon.

1745
01:22:50,730 --> 01:22:51,880
Speaking at the Comedy Store.

1746
01:22:51,930 --> 01:22:55,710
Going at comedy clubs so much you just
have to fucking during me and Tony battle

1747
01:22:55,711 --> 01:22:58,870
with this almost every single night
where we're like have you got a drink.

1748
01:22:58,920 --> 01:22:59,753
Yeah.

1749
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:04,980
Because you know I mean it's just you
know what's interesting about you know

1750
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:09,900
it's like either the night's going great
and you want to drink to celebrate or

1751
01:23:09,901 --> 01:23:11,140
it's a fucking boring night.

1752
01:23:11,190 --> 01:23:13,050
You want to drink to have more fun.

1753
01:23:13,410 --> 01:23:17,070
It's like there's never ever a time where
I'm just like in the middle like you

1754
01:23:17,071 --> 01:23:17,790
know.

1755
01:23:17,790 --> 01:23:21,930
I just said yeah we're
going to do it every night.

1756
01:23:22,380 --> 01:23:24,640
Have a show though man it
really can wear on you.

1757
01:23:25,050 --> 01:23:29,970
Well you know I'm very lucky because on
my end of it I'll sometimes only have a

1758
01:23:29,971 --> 01:23:34,971
half a drink or one drink because I'm
very little and I'm very reactive.

1759
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:40,590
And so how many beers does
it take to get you fucked up.

1760
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:42,060
Two and a half probably.

1761
01:23:42,150 --> 01:23:44,220
Yeah two and a half beers and fucked up.

1762
01:23:44,550 --> 01:23:45,630
Three I'm fucked up.

1763
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:48,993
Great.

1764
01:23:50,060 --> 01:23:50,350
Yeah.

1765
01:23:50,350 --> 01:23:53,680
Three and I just decide to tell a story
that I wasn't sure if I was gonna tell.

1766
01:23:55,660 --> 01:23:58,350
Yeah I normally don't get to my
third during Ken till pretty late.

1767
01:23:58,540 --> 01:23:59,460
Oh really that's funny.

1768
01:23:59,630 --> 01:24:02,040
Yeah that's weird.

1769
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:02,993
How much you weigh.

1770
01:24:05,220 --> 01:24:08,000
Probably about 127 right around there.

1771
01:24:08,690 --> 01:24:11,040
And if you think about
a beer is what a pound

1772
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:14,353
right.

1773
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:15,380
Yeah I guess so.

1774
01:24:16,130 --> 01:24:20,570
I'd say subtle of Jack Daniels fucks
me up essentially you get to like one

1775
01:24:20,571 --> 01:24:24,050
percent of your body weight fairly
quickly 1 percent by weight in beer.

1776
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:25,580
Oh that's interesting.

1777
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:28,753
Yeah.

1778
01:24:30,050 --> 01:24:31,260
Would you say what about Jack Daniels.

1779
01:24:31,550 --> 01:24:34,300
I've gotten to the point where I think
one bottle of Jack Daniels would fuck me

1780
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:37,870
shut up son you fucking start
slurring when you open the cap.

1781
01:24:38,430 --> 01:24:42,270
Larry slurring in and then alive.

1782
01:24:42,590 --> 01:24:45,620
Sometimes I feel like I'm talking about
like bleeding from the liver until I

1783
01:24:45,621 --> 01:24:46,454
expire.

1784
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:55,670
Yeah it's interesting that no one's
figured out a way to create the effect of

1785
01:24:55,671 --> 01:24:58,850
alcohol without the horrific
effects to your fucking body.

1786
01:24:59,510 --> 01:25:00,980
Well gee you know my way works.

1787
01:25:01,010 --> 01:25:04,640
You could just get down to one hundred
and twenty seven and just sip on a drink

1788
01:25:04,641 --> 01:25:05,474
all night long.

1789
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:09,940
Feel great or black out every night
because you keep forgetting nearly one sex

1790
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:11,030
sounds now right.

1791
01:25:12,290 --> 01:25:14,870
Like you imagine it like a guy
like Tate would take could.

1792
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:16,820
Well he doesn't drink but in his prime.

1793
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:20,960
Big guy you know the guys
can put away more like Joey.

1794
01:25:21,140 --> 01:25:24,060
Joey could put away some
fuckin booze at the wedding.

1795
01:25:24,150 --> 01:25:24,740
Joey

1796
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:28,140
Joey barely ever drinks but when
he does he always gets the most.

1797
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:32,080
He said so cute that you'll get
like I got an orange cream sickle.

1798
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:33,240
He was a good man.

1799
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:37,190
That's why you know people
like pina coladas and shit.

1800
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:37,670
Yeah yeah.

1801
01:25:37,670 --> 01:25:41,780
Fucked up and some folks only allow
them that on when they're on vacation.

1802
01:25:42,230 --> 01:25:43,063
But men.

1803
01:25:43,390 --> 01:25:46,340
Well when men are drinking
they weren't manly shit.

1804
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:48,770
They want something that is mixing up.

1805
01:25:52,190 --> 01:25:53,050
Oh yeah right.

1806
01:25:53,660 --> 01:25:55,150
Talking about here's one drink right now.

1807
01:25:56,270 --> 01:25:57,590
I have a long night of drinking.

1808
01:25:57,740 --> 01:25:58,573
Don't be a pussy.

1809
01:25:59,300 --> 01:26:01,670
You're saying you rather drink
with them than drink with us.

1810
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:03,660
No I mean how would you have you.

1811
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:07,010
How dare you let me know what you have
because I'm pretty hung over right now.

1812
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:09,830
Well I'm about to go watch
a fucking UFO documentary.

1813
01:26:09,860 --> 01:26:12,670
So I'm fixing you're fucked
up if only I can watch today.

1814
01:26:13,010 --> 01:26:17,180
I'm not really big on watching UFO
documentaries while sober there's a spray

1815
01:26:17,270 --> 01:26:18,200
something's gonna go wrong.

1816
01:26:18,980 --> 01:26:23,720
This jam van just showed me there's a
spray that gets you instantly drunk for a

1817
01:26:23,721 --> 01:26:24,560
few seconds.

1818
01:26:24,830 --> 01:26:26,480
Well that sounds awesome.

1819
01:26:26,570 --> 01:26:27,590
Seems super healthy.

1820
01:26:27,710 --> 01:26:32,090
You should give give that to yourself
right before you leave the house.

1821
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:33,770
How long does it last.

1822
01:26:35,330 --> 01:26:37,370
It doesn't say just a few 5 seconds.

1823
01:26:37,610 --> 01:26:38,930
Is it like some limpets type shit.

1824
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:39,530
Yes.

1825
01:26:39,530 --> 01:26:39,920
No.

1826
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:40,760
I don't know what it is.

1827
01:26:41,510 --> 01:26:43,330
It's one spray releases.

1828
01:26:43,370 --> 01:26:46,510
Point 0 0 7 5 0 0

1829
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:51,680
0 gets you drunk legally 0 legally drunk.

1830
01:26:51,710 --> 01:26:55,970
How would you show me that they got
some sportscaster some sportscaster got

1831
01:26:55,971 --> 01:26:56,900
pulled over for.

1832
01:26:57,880 --> 01:26:58,713
Is it Al Michaels.

1833
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:01,050
I got pulled over and he was on the limit.

1834
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:05,150
It was absent at the limit 0 8 and 0 9.

1835
01:27:05,510 --> 01:27:06,800
What happens then when you're out.

1836
01:27:07,130 --> 01:27:07,940
Here's a link.

1837
01:27:07,940 --> 01:27:10,850
Don't you first have to do the drug test.

1838
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:14,330
You know like you walk around like a
buffoon and then if you fail that then you

1839
01:27:14,331 --> 01:27:14,990
have to do it.

1840
01:27:14,990 --> 01:27:18,410
He obviously I guess showed
signs that he can't do.

1841
01:27:18,470 --> 01:27:20,030
You know balance on one foot.

1842
01:27:20,150 --> 01:27:20,690
You know so.

1843
01:27:20,690 --> 01:27:21,710
Well not necessarily.

1844
01:27:21,740 --> 01:27:24,410
They might have just asked him and he
said he would take the test cause you only

1845
01:27:24,411 --> 01:27:25,130
had one drink.

1846
01:27:25,130 --> 01:27:25,860
That's what he's saying.

1847
01:27:25,860 --> 01:27:27,050
Saying he only had one drink.

1848
01:27:28,030 --> 01:27:29,350
I think that I read that note.

1849
01:27:29,630 --> 01:27:30,050
You know what.

1850
01:27:30,050 --> 01:27:31,550
That's what the I'm sorry.

1851
01:27:31,820 --> 01:27:33,830
That's what Reese
Witherspoon's husband said.

1852
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:35,270
You got the wrong drunk.

1853
01:27:35,390 --> 01:27:40,110
He said he only had one job but the Al
Michaels guy he tested on the limit.

1854
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:41,810
And he's a fuckin man's man.

1855
01:27:41,830 --> 01:27:43,190
He's a fuckin sportscaster.

1856
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:46,070
He told me that guy doesn't know how
to drive when he's a little tipsy.

1857
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:47,533
He's an 0 8.

1858
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:48,290
Let him go.

1859
01:27:48,290 --> 01:27:53,290
You pussy don't you appreciate a good
game of hockey being called by the maestro

1860
01:27:53,650 --> 01:27:54,950
and he let him go.

1861
01:27:54,980 --> 01:27:57,680
It's not like you're
letting go of criminal 0 8.

1862
01:27:57,830 --> 01:28:00,370
Not something pro drinker
that's a pro socialized.

1863
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:02,300
Like I've known him since he was a baby.

1864
01:28:02,420 --> 01:28:03,253
Yeah.

1865
01:28:03,260 --> 01:28:04,093
0 8.

1866
01:28:04,130 --> 01:28:05,120
The fuck out of here.

1867
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:06,890
What a pussy society we have.

1868
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:08,113
That's not drunk.

1869
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:09,150
OK if he's drunk.

1870
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:09,980
Yeah for sure.

1871
01:28:09,980 --> 01:28:11,810
Arrest him asshole.

1872
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:12,920
That's ridiculous.

1873
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:16,670
People driving around drunk are assholes
but people driving around that are

1874
01:28:16,671 --> 01:28:18,440
barely buzzed at 0 8.

1875
01:28:18,650 --> 01:28:19,370
Come on.

1876
01:28:19,370 --> 01:28:23,450
How do I know that your body functions
as good as mine does when I'm drunk.

1877
01:28:23,480 --> 01:28:24,313
How about that.

1878
01:28:24,590 --> 01:28:25,460
Your reaction time.

1879
01:28:25,490 --> 01:28:26,340
How good is your outlook.

1880
01:28:26,420 --> 01:28:30,410
How do I know you're not a dullard
without with a slow right foot.

1881
01:28:31,010 --> 01:28:32,800
You just can't get to that burger on time.

1882
01:28:34,930 --> 01:28:39,930
You know maybe Al Michaels could still
even eat whatever he is 70 and still do a

1883
01:28:40,461 --> 01:28:43,250
solid two step hits
that break like a champ.

1884
01:28:43,970 --> 01:28:45,170
Not saying he should drive drunk.

1885
01:28:45,530 --> 01:28:47,210
I'm saying what's 0 8.

1886
01:28:48,330 --> 01:28:49,300
Looks like a drink right.

1887
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:51,760
Yeah pretty close yeah.

1888
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:56,300
I would like to see what a 0 8
guy looks like performing stuff.

1889
01:28:56,550 --> 01:28:58,440
You know I wouldn't like
to see him go through that.

1890
01:28:58,820 --> 01:28:59,480
I would like to.

1891
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:02,060
I'm sure he's always nowhere
when he's calling the Super Bowl.

1892
01:29:02,090 --> 01:29:03,790
You know what I mean bright you know.

1893
01:29:03,820 --> 01:29:06,950
You know one that doesn't count though
here's the thing though is the adrenaline

1894
01:29:06,951 --> 01:29:08,150
that you get when you get pulled over.

1895
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:11,580
I would imagine that would have
some sort of a recuperative effect.

1896
01:29:11,630 --> 01:29:15,140
Like if you're a little a little driving
a little shitty cause you're kind of

1897
01:29:15,141 --> 01:29:18,740
hammered and you get pulled over and it
might jolt you into a position where you

1898
01:29:18,741 --> 01:29:22,790
could possibly perform the test a little
better than you could be but it's not

1899
01:29:22,791 --> 01:29:23,840
going to make you less drunk right.

1900
01:29:24,580 --> 01:29:26,090
So 0 8 is still in 0 8.

1901
01:29:26,290 --> 01:29:27,123
She blew it.

1902
01:29:28,190 --> 01:29:33,190
Yeah I think it's just entirely too low
to blanket that that's considered a DUI.

1903
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:38,880
Because I mean you know if you go out
to dinner and you have a drink like a

1904
01:29:39,021 --> 01:29:43,130
margarita and a bartender like
cause it's stronger than normal.

1905
01:29:43,820 --> 01:29:47,270
Are you saying that just
having one margarita with
dinner you should go to jail

1906
01:29:47,290 --> 01:29:50,450
and you know get all these things on
your license that you think you know that

1907
01:29:50,451 --> 01:29:53,120
you're gonna run into a pile
into a school of children.

1908
01:29:53,230 --> 01:29:54,470
Like I don't buy that.

1909
01:29:54,530 --> 01:29:56,190
I think that's I think that's it.

1910
01:29:56,570 --> 01:29:57,540
I don't know I'm not a big fan.

1911
01:29:57,830 --> 01:29:58,850
I think aging needs to change.

1912
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:02,330
I think that's a dosage issue where
you're talking about the dosage issue and

1913
01:30:02,331 --> 01:30:04,820
that they really should get in
trouble if they're doing that.

1914
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:07,790
I mean people don't want to
get in trouble you go you go.

1915
01:30:07,810 --> 01:30:09,530
This proves the good the stiffest drinks.

1916
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:14,030
You really should let people know what
the fuck you serve them and if you're

1917
01:30:14,031 --> 01:30:17,060
serving them some margaritas It's got
twice the alcohol in it you're trying to

1918
01:30:17,061 --> 01:30:21,230
get customers that way you could fuck
somebody up if they know exactly how they

1919
01:30:21,231 --> 01:30:24,800
usually rocket you know they have this
thing I'm good for one margarita and then

1920
01:30:24,801 --> 01:30:26,840
I back the fuck off and then
I get home and I'm fine.

1921
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:29,320
And then also the guys hand driving on.

1922
01:30:29,420 --> 01:30:32,870
He doesn't know what happens because you
you say saying essentially like doubled

1923
01:30:32,871 --> 01:30:33,560
his dose.

1924
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:35,930
Yeah I'm just saying
it's way too low I think.

1925
01:30:36,380 --> 01:30:37,400
Yeah but not to you.

1926
01:30:37,510 --> 01:30:39,080
I guess I see your point.

1927
01:30:39,410 --> 01:30:40,040
Definitely.

1928
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:41,930
But I'm not convinced.

1929
01:30:42,260 --> 01:30:46,160
I don't have any data I want to see a
guy who's at a weight go through all that

1930
01:30:46,161 --> 01:30:46,700
shit.

1931
01:30:46,700 --> 01:30:48,340
Is it based on what percentage you are.

1932
01:30:48,420 --> 01:30:49,260
Your fine too.

1933
01:30:49,580 --> 01:30:50,600
You know I want to do it.

1934
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:51,080
I want to.

1935
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:52,310
I want not to get you guys together.

1936
01:30:52,370 --> 01:30:53,203
No.

1937
01:30:53,470 --> 01:30:54,303
No I don't want to.

1938
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:57,680
That's one thing I've been really
careful about my entire life.

1939
01:30:58,100 --> 01:31:03,100
I think it's really important to be
safe when you're operating a vehicle.

1940
01:31:03,950 --> 01:31:08,240
I mean the idea that you would operate a
vehicle with your body all fuck in half

1941
01:31:08,241 --> 01:31:09,074
there.

1942
01:31:09,230 --> 01:31:13,300
That's so scary to me it's so scary to
be the driver it's so scary thinking that

1943
01:31:13,340 --> 01:31:14,840
so many people out
there that are doing it.

1944
01:31:15,110 --> 01:31:20,110
It's so selfish and stupid but I think
that I would like to find out what it

1945
01:31:22,191 --> 01:31:24,110
feels like to be at 0 8.

1946
01:31:24,380 --> 01:31:27,480
And do you know any of those
tests any of those lean.

1947
01:31:27,630 --> 01:31:28,463
I wouldn't know.

1948
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:32,750
What is it like if they say like you know
I'm not gonna drive but get me to the

1949
01:31:32,751 --> 01:31:33,200
limit.

1950
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:34,033
Give me a breathalyzer.

1951
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:35,650
OK you're at 0 8 now.

1952
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:39,410
Like whether it's three drinks or two
drinks and now make me do your stuff.

1953
01:31:40,010 --> 01:31:40,910
I want to know what it feels like.

1954
01:31:41,070 --> 01:31:43,130
Buy you can buy a breathalyzer
on Amazon you should do it.

1955
01:31:43,370 --> 01:31:44,750
I don't want to do it
because I don't want to.

1956
01:31:45,180 --> 01:31:48,900
I definitely don't want to drive by
but I would like to drive on a course I

1957
01:31:48,901 --> 01:31:53,310
would like to go on a course and see
like get me to 0 9 and let me see what I

1958
01:31:53,311 --> 01:31:53,880
can do.

1959
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:57,270
I think you're gonna be surprised how
exactly normal you're gonna be feeling.

1960
01:31:57,540 --> 01:32:02,280
I wonder why I wonder because I've
been drunk and as of you I wonder.

1961
01:32:02,370 --> 01:32:04,980
I wonder what it's like to do that.

1962
01:32:05,430 --> 01:32:10,430
Well I would but then again like telling
people that 0 8 or 0 9 is the limit

1963
01:32:11,700 --> 01:32:16,700
means that's probably where most people
who are not in the best shape or don't

1964
01:32:16,891 --> 01:32:19,590
have the best talents for alcohol
where they start to falter.

1965
01:32:19,830 --> 01:32:23,970
So if you make it a public policy that's
probably a good idea to do it on the

1966
01:32:23,971 --> 01:32:28,610
conservative side you know ethnic humor
you had a fun funny thing was talking

1967
01:32:28,611 --> 01:32:30,950
about like it should really be based
on your tolerance and they should you

1968
01:32:30,951 --> 01:32:34,960
should have like a license that indicate
their tolerance but that shit changes

1969
01:32:34,970 --> 01:32:35,260
too.

1970
01:32:35,260 --> 01:32:36,500
Because dudes start falling apart.

1971
01:32:37,650 --> 01:32:37,880
Yeah.

1972
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:40,740
You have to just take a license test
Sara tolerance test once a year.

1973
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:44,780
It's so incredibly irresponsible
to tell people they can drink more.

1974
01:32:44,980 --> 01:32:45,813
Right.

1975
01:32:46,150 --> 01:32:50,120
You know they tell people that the
legal limit as is that you could drink a

1976
01:32:50,121 --> 01:32:50,954
little more.

1977
01:32:52,210 --> 01:32:53,940
Fuck just fucking green light.

1978
01:32:54,630 --> 01:32:55,463
I love that.

1979
01:32:56,060 --> 01:32:57,740
Yeah and God dance like me boy.

1980
01:32:57,960 --> 01:32:59,590
I got tolerance like.

1981
01:32:59,780 --> 01:33:01,880
I mean think about like
that my friend Justin.

1982
01:33:01,930 --> 01:33:02,870
Here's a perfect example.

1983
01:33:02,900 --> 01:33:06,380
You know my friend Justin said that seven
foot tall did not find Justin's like a

1984
01:33:06,381 --> 01:33:07,220
legitimate giant.

1985
01:33:07,250 --> 01:33:08,083
He's enormous.

1986
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:10,780
And if you go drink for drink
with him you're gonna die.

1987
01:33:11,210 --> 01:33:13,170
If you're going to die you're
not the same species as him.

1988
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:14,940
He's a completely different human being.

1989
01:33:15,010 --> 01:33:17,210
So it's like a dog next to a cat.

1990
01:33:17,250 --> 01:33:18,200
It's not the same time.

1991
01:33:18,230 --> 01:33:22,250
Pretty sure it's Andre the Giant
actually has a drinking record.

1992
01:33:22,570 --> 01:33:23,240
I'm serious.

1993
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:24,830
I think he has some.

1994
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:27,750
There's a drinking record
I think it's a crazy night.

1995
01:33:27,950 --> 01:33:29,100
And lawyers.

1996
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:30,500
Wow.

1997
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:30,980
Wow.

1998
01:33:30,980 --> 01:33:34,370
But he was you know he's like
he's like seven foot something.

1999
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:35,233
He was enormous.

2000
01:33:36,170 --> 01:33:36,560
Yeah.

2001
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:39,890
There's been a few giants since
then that gotten mixed martial arts.

2002
01:33:40,220 --> 01:33:42,440
This is Guy giant Silva.

2003
01:33:42,650 --> 01:33:43,850
He was like a legit giant.

2004
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:47,630
And he fought in pride.

2005
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:51,680
And then there's Antonio
Big Foot Silva and that guy.

2006
01:33:51,780 --> 01:33:54,920
I think I'm seeing I think I'm saying
giant silver I think that's his name.

2007
01:33:55,130 --> 01:33:56,060
If not I apologize.

2008
01:33:56,350 --> 01:33:58,160
It's a big giant go crazy shaggy hair.

2009
01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:00,100
And then there's another guy semi shell.

2010
01:34:00,170 --> 01:34:01,340
He's like seven feet tall.

2011
01:34:01,430 --> 01:34:02,870
I think he's just a huge guy.

2012
01:34:02,930 --> 01:34:07,930
I don't think he has gigantism I think
he's just an enormous regular human but

2013
01:34:08,950 --> 01:34:13,180
you would just imagine a guy like conjure
the giant those little tiny you ever

2014
01:34:13,181 --> 01:34:15,130
see a picture of a little
tiny beer can in his hand.

2015
01:34:15,370 --> 01:34:15,940
Yeah.

2016
01:34:15,940 --> 01:34:18,910
To Tracy to trip he would
hold a beer in his hand.

2017
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:22,420
I was like you hold on when those little
kids apple juices you know the ones

2018
01:34:22,421 --> 01:34:23,490
that come in lunchboxes.

2019
01:34:23,620 --> 01:34:28,620
Well this is that they estimated that he
drank over 7000 calories every day and

2020
01:34:28,931 --> 01:34:30,190
booze alone.

2021
01:34:31,210 --> 01:34:32,150
I wouldn't do that.

2022
01:34:32,260 --> 01:34:34,030
Do they have the sat
there the number with.

2023
01:34:34,510 --> 01:34:36,490
I know it's like a decisive thing.

2024
01:34:36,910 --> 01:34:39,940
Well I want to see the picture of
his hand because it's so silly.

2025
01:34:40,390 --> 01:34:44,230
You know Rowdy Roddy Piper started coming
by the comedy store a couple of years

2026
01:34:44,231 --> 01:34:47,410
ago and once in a while he'll swing in
and he's friends with a few of us there.

2027
01:34:47,620 --> 01:34:51,550
And man he's so great at
hanging out and telling stories.

2028
01:34:52,140 --> 01:34:55,050
And one of the stories that he
told us was about Andre the Giant.

2029
01:34:55,110 --> 01:34:59,230
Somebody was guys you know because they
did the road together for a decade or

2030
01:34:59,231 --> 01:34:59,380
right.

2031
01:34:59,380 --> 01:35:00,070
Right.

2032
01:35:00,070 --> 01:35:05,070
And he talks about how one time they were
at a bar and there were these college

2033
01:35:06,041 --> 01:35:09,370
kids like you know fuck
you Andre the Giant

2034
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:15,640
that they're drinking beers at that
one time a kid drinks a beer throws the

2035
01:35:15,641 --> 01:35:18,040
empty can at the back Andre
the Giant said and he goes.

2036
01:35:18,100 --> 01:35:19,240
Don't do that again.

2037
01:35:19,540 --> 01:35:23,380
And then later on he takes an empty can
and he throws it at the back onto the

2038
01:35:23,381 --> 01:35:25,140
giant's head and they do
that and they all sure.

2039
01:35:25,900 --> 01:35:26,733
Oh my God.

2040
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:28,630
And they all run outside.

2041
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:33,310
Running away from Andre the Giant who
got up and is now chasing them and they

2042
01:35:33,311 --> 01:35:37,690
all got in their car all at once but
Andre caught up to the car before it drove

2043
01:35:37,691 --> 01:35:39,580
away and he just flipped.

2044
01:35:39,730 --> 01:35:41,680
He he picked up the coin
as you hear the story.

2045
01:35:41,740 --> 01:35:42,700
Rowdy Roddy Piper.

2046
01:35:42,940 --> 01:35:43,420
Really.

2047
01:35:43,420 --> 01:35:43,780
Yeah.

2048
01:35:43,780 --> 01:35:46,000
It's got to be a true
story too even if it's not.

2049
01:35:46,120 --> 01:35:46,953
Let's let him tell it.

2050
01:35:48,550 --> 01:35:50,680
Isn't that picture hilarious
though him holding the beer can.

2051
01:35:51,010 --> 01:35:52,210
I mean it's like a little bait.

2052
01:35:52,240 --> 01:35:55,810
It's like you ever see like a little
kids refrigerators that they would fake

2053
01:35:55,811 --> 01:35:56,260
refrigerator.

2054
01:35:56,260 --> 01:35:57,093
That's what looks like.

2055
01:35:57,360 --> 01:35:59,530
One hundred and nineteen
beers in six hours.

2056
01:35:59,740 --> 01:36:00,730
God that's what they're trying.

2057
01:36:01,230 --> 01:36:02,110
Yeah that's what he drank.

2058
01:36:02,170 --> 01:36:03,003
Yeah yeah.

2059
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:04,240
How big was that guy.

2060
01:36:05,380 --> 01:36:06,630
What was his height and weight

2061
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:11,370
7 1 7 foot 1.

2062
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:14,330
And he wasn't just tall.

2063
01:36:14,350 --> 01:36:15,700
He was enormous.

2064
01:36:15,790 --> 01:36:16,623
Oh yeah.

2065
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:21,760
God damn between 6 and 7 5 and over 5
some between 6 7 7 5 and over 500 pounds.

2066
01:36:25,030 --> 01:36:28,570
And then I also saw some that's a very
whole fucking they measure him right.

2067
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:32,950
You know what the problem with that is
wrestling they lie you know six foot

2068
01:36:33,190 --> 01:36:38,190
eleven 3000 pound twisted steel you know
they lie just to make guys look bigger.

2069
01:36:40,970 --> 01:36:44,200
But that guy was like legitimately
enormous like in a real wrestling match he

2070
01:36:44,201 --> 01:36:45,034
would beat everybody.

2071
01:36:45,430 --> 01:36:49,930
I also heard a thing that that big body
slam that was like from the big wrestle

2072
01:36:49,931 --> 01:36:54,280
mania to where Hulk Hogan body slams
the ultimate bad guy Andre the Giant.

2073
01:36:54,370 --> 01:36:54,850
Right.

2074
01:36:54,850 --> 01:36:59,020
And it's like you could tell Andre the
Giant jumps into it with all his might

2075
01:36:59,030 --> 01:37:00,470
and Hogan's just trying to.

2076
01:37:00,610 --> 01:37:01,190
Yeah.

2077
01:37:01,190 --> 01:37:03,070
All he needs to do is go like that.

2078
01:37:03,310 --> 01:37:04,810
It's amazing that he
can even hold them up.

2079
01:37:04,940 --> 01:37:09,160
And he said that when he did that he
could feel every disc in his back just go

2080
01:37:09,430 --> 01:37:10,690
up up up up up up up up.

2081
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:11,500
Hulk Hogan.

2082
01:37:11,500 --> 01:37:11,980
Yeah.

2083
01:37:11,980 --> 01:37:15,220
And then he laid down Andre the Giant
and he was just so glad that that was the

2084
01:37:15,221 --> 01:37:18,250
end of the match because
he he ruined his back.

2085
01:37:18,310 --> 01:37:19,143
Yeah.

2086
01:37:19,740 --> 01:37:21,220
His back is fucked up now right.

2087
01:37:22,190 --> 01:37:23,140
He's had surgery.

2088
01:37:23,260 --> 01:37:24,130
All these guys are.

2089
01:37:24,370 --> 01:37:28,210
Those guys are unbelievable warriors
because they were doing it every night and

2090
01:37:28,211 --> 01:37:29,320
sold out arenas.

2091
01:37:29,410 --> 01:37:30,243
You don't realize.

2092
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:30,670
Right.

2093
01:37:30,670 --> 01:37:31,970
They had to put on a show.

2094
01:37:31,990 --> 01:37:33,190
They were going non-stop.

2095
01:37:33,540 --> 01:37:37,990
And like even Piper just like six or
seven months ago he was by the store.

2096
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:42,760
He would come in like once in a while
every few days for you know just then.

2097
01:37:42,910 --> 01:37:43,790
Anyway he could.

2098
01:37:43,810 --> 01:37:47,410
He kept going Oh my shoulder saw my
shoulder so I'm going to the doctor on

2099
01:37:47,411 --> 01:37:48,244
Wednesday.

2100
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:50,470
It's still worked out
for four hours today.

2101
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:54,490
Well my shoulder saw Hannah finding out
that he had a technically broken his

2102
01:37:54,491 --> 01:37:55,324
neck.

2103
01:37:55,510 --> 01:37:58,990
A broken neck and the doctor's like it's
not your shoulder it's your neck and

2104
01:37:58,991 --> 01:37:59,824
it's broken.

2105
01:38:00,520 --> 01:38:03,670
So it was like pinching a nerve and
Ryder was hurting his shoulder right.

2106
01:38:03,970 --> 01:38:05,020
But he he's just.

2107
01:38:05,290 --> 01:38:07,510
These guys are so tough in real life.

2108
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:08,433
That

2109
01:38:09,790 --> 01:38:11,620
is to hit on a sore shoulder.

2110
01:38:11,860 --> 01:38:12,050
Yeah.

2111
01:38:12,050 --> 01:38:13,900
What does people give a fuck
about wrestling anymore.

2112
01:38:14,230 --> 01:38:15,340
Oh yeah they're still there.

2113
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:16,780
It's still very popular.

2114
01:38:16,870 --> 01:38:17,650
Unbelievable.

2115
01:38:17,650 --> 01:38:18,670
I keep seeing like C.M.

2116
01:38:18,671 --> 01:38:22,210
Punk and all these people and all the
pictures and been crazy is that you know

2117
01:38:22,330 --> 01:38:25,720
most people don't know this but like
Monday night raw for example which is the

2118
01:38:25,721 --> 01:38:29,820
premiere weekly show
someone's a wrestling fan.

2119
01:38:30,540 --> 01:38:32,460
Yeah but it's been number one on one.

2120
01:38:32,530 --> 01:38:34,420
It's held Monday nights forever.

2121
01:38:34,870 --> 01:38:36,730
Do you know this and why
the fuck do you know this.

2122
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:38,050
I said I'm saying let's go on.

2123
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:40,810
When I was saying when I was a kid
I was in a wrestling like that.

2124
01:38:41,150 --> 01:38:43,300
And then I grew up and go oh my gosh.

2125
01:38:43,510 --> 01:38:45,250
Yeah I can't believe you went there.

2126
01:38:45,340 --> 01:38:48,040
Me too and I still like wrestling
I'm still has pubic hair.

2127
01:38:48,070 --> 01:38:49,510
Dude stop being an asshole.

2128
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:50,080
I don't.

2129
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:51,050
I haven't watched wrestling.

2130
01:38:51,070 --> 01:38:53,260
What you're doing is
cyberbullying right now.

2131
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:56,140
No I'm just I've been giving him a
hard time because they all had like a

2132
01:38:56,141 --> 01:39:00,400
wrestling party and I was there wasn't
we our buddy you got wrestling mania and

2133
01:39:00,401 --> 01:39:03,210
he has a giant screen and it's funny too.

2134
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:05,290
You know we all do you
guys take our clothes off.

2135
01:39:05,680 --> 01:39:06,270
Yes.

2136
01:39:06,270 --> 01:39:06,550
Right.

2137
01:39:06,550 --> 01:39:08,110
Did you reenact the moves with lube.

2138
01:39:08,290 --> 01:39:09,123
Yes.

2139
01:39:10,930 --> 01:39:13,240
Hey what do you think
about this CSPAN thing.

2140
01:39:13,450 --> 01:39:16,660
The bill that passed the House
it's fucked up crazy scary.

2141
01:39:16,870 --> 01:39:21,550
If you guys don't know about the House
of Representatives passed Cisco which is

2142
01:39:21,551 --> 01:39:26,551
the Cyber Intelligence
Sharing and Protection Act
by a 288 to 127 vote and it's

2143
01:39:30,910 --> 01:39:35,200
the ideas supposedly that it's meant
to enhance national security by

2144
01:39:35,201 --> 01:39:40,201
facilitating sharing of
electronic information between
like this quote between

2145
01:39:40,511 --> 01:39:45,511
say a private company and the government
this is a story from media dot com and

2146
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:53,400
the way they describe it is that if the
government like say if a private company

2147
01:39:54,671 --> 01:39:58,090
in the government deemed threatening the
bill's opponents maintain it will make

2148
01:39:58,091 --> 01:40:03,091
sharing of personal private information
far too easy so I guess the idea is what

2149
01:40:06,081 --> 01:40:11,081
is it what is the main the main idea
about behind this bill is that they're

2150
01:40:11,331 --> 01:40:15,150
going to be able to see every website
you've ever visited every Web site will

2151
01:40:15,170 --> 01:40:19,180
have a bill to share the information of
different people who have gone to them

2152
01:40:19,190 --> 01:40:24,190
that would just you know I have no idea
what the exact specific thing is but

2153
01:40:26,150 --> 01:40:27,980
yeah it seems like that's
what I was talking about.

2154
01:40:29,100 --> 01:40:32,820
But it isn't going to be vetoed by Obama.

2155
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:36,810
I don't know because he didn't
have but he didn't veto the NDAA.

2156
01:40:37,140 --> 01:40:42,140
You know I mean Obama is a hilarious
kind of situation because he's super

2157
01:40:43,231 --> 01:40:48,231
intelligent he's half black he's you
know from a single parent household but

2158
01:40:49,770 --> 01:40:53,520
he's still like votes just
like the Republicans do.

2159
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:57,540
He still does stuff that the
Republicans do like it's really strange.

2160
01:40:58,070 --> 01:41:03,070
It's like if he was a white guy people
would be fuckin furious if he was a white

2161
01:41:03,421 --> 01:41:07,980
guy of privileged background and he made
the choices that he's made as far as

2162
01:41:07,981 --> 01:41:12,981
like bailing out the banks as far as
passing the NDAA not vetoing in all these

2163
01:41:13,291 --> 01:41:16,140
different things that have happened the
drones all these different things that

2164
01:41:16,141 --> 01:41:17,490
have happened while he was in office.

2165
01:41:17,730 --> 01:41:20,640
If he was a white guy of privilege
he would be getting crucified.

2166
01:41:21,180 --> 01:41:22,013
It's fascinating.

2167
01:41:22,410 --> 01:41:27,410
It's almost like the perfect plan like
if you were a military strategist and

2168
01:41:27,841 --> 01:41:31,020
you're trying to take over the company
you would do it with a situation like

2169
01:41:31,021 --> 01:41:36,021
that you wouldn't just go get some super
elite rich guy you'd get some guy who

2170
01:41:36,031 --> 01:41:41,031
you would associate automatically with
progressive liberal sensibilities and

2171
01:41:43,441 --> 01:41:45,900
then you do all that creepy
shit right under his nose.

2172
01:41:45,980 --> 01:41:46,960
It's really interesting.

2173
01:41:47,010 --> 01:41:49,190
His big slogan was change yeah.

2174
01:41:49,290 --> 01:41:53,760
And looking back on it now it's like
well he changed a little you know drone

2175
01:41:53,761 --> 01:41:58,761
attacks went from 50 up to like
300 changed a lot in Pakistan.

2176
01:42:01,260 --> 01:42:03,150
It's not funny but fuck man.

2177
01:42:04,050 --> 01:42:09,050
I don't know it's uh it's it's just seems
like it if if he really could change

2178
01:42:10,331 --> 01:42:10,630
things.

2179
01:42:10,630 --> 01:42:14,410
If you really could like influence
this society and how is the time to do

2180
01:42:14,411 --> 01:42:19,411
something you know instead of just these
speeches sort of reactionary speeches

2181
01:42:19,661 --> 01:42:22,480
dealing with each and every issue
whether it's Sandy Hook or whether it's

2182
01:42:22,930 --> 01:42:27,930
whether it's this Boston thing like
wonder what if anything could be done to

2183
01:42:31,281 --> 01:42:33,890
sort of enact a

2184
01:42:35,630 --> 01:42:40,630
a change in a culture a plea
for for a change in a culture.

2185
01:42:42,590 --> 01:42:45,760
And if anybody could do that
it's got to be the president.

2186
01:42:46,150 --> 01:42:48,160
You know and the president addresses.

2187
01:42:48,610 --> 01:42:53,610
He does these national speeches where he
addresses policies and he addresses not

2188
01:42:55,631 --> 01:43:00,400
national affairs as far as
security affairs and then
threats and various things

2189
01:43:00,401 --> 01:43:01,234
along those lines.

2190
01:43:01,390 --> 01:43:06,390
But what this country's really fucking
needs they need of a different not not a

2191
01:43:09,951 --> 01:43:12,320
different person but a different mantra.

2192
01:43:12,530 --> 01:43:15,410
We need a new way of looking at things.

2193
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:16,700
We need a speech.

2194
01:43:17,240 --> 01:43:22,240
We need something that gets people believe
and we need an I have a dream that I

2195
01:43:22,461 --> 01:43:26,810
have a dream Martin Luther
King's speech to this day.

2196
01:43:26,830 --> 01:43:28,030
That shit resonates.

2197
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:31,390
No one's doing the I Have A Dream today.

2198
01:43:31,930 --> 01:43:33,100
Everyone's doing the.

2199
01:43:33,180 --> 01:43:38,080
We're all gonna get along and change
and hope and you know and make it more

2200
01:43:38,081 --> 01:43:40,970
affordable and healthcare for everyone.

2201
01:43:40,990 --> 01:43:42,260
And gay marriage.

2202
01:43:43,330 --> 01:43:48,330
But no one has a speech about uniting
humanity and getting us to understand that

2203
01:43:51,370 --> 01:43:56,290
our lives really are truly only better
when people around us lives are better as

2204
01:43:56,291 --> 01:44:01,070
well and that United
there's enough resources for
everybody there's enough love

2205
01:44:01,150 --> 01:44:03,730
everybody is enough nuff
health for everybody.

2206
01:44:03,910 --> 01:44:04,743
There really is.

2207
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:10,090
It's just the current system in the
current ideology that we have is not based

2208
01:44:10,091 --> 01:44:12,080
on the reality that we're
an expiring lifeform.

2209
01:44:12,790 --> 01:44:17,260
And then we have a temporary time here
on this planet and to waste it not being

2210
01:44:17,261 --> 01:44:22,261
aware of the full reality of the situation
is a shame and a guy like Obama has

2211
01:44:24,561 --> 01:44:29,150
the opportunity to do that but he
doesn't ever say anything like that.

2212
01:44:29,690 --> 01:44:33,950
He never says anything that
really inspires people to
look at it in a completely

2213
01:44:33,951 --> 01:44:34,784
different way.

2214
01:44:34,970 --> 01:44:39,110
He never says anything
like I think you have to.

2215
01:44:39,230 --> 01:44:44,230
If you're in a position to be the fucking
President of the United States that's

2216
01:44:44,810 --> 01:44:48,110
a position with very few human
beings ever get to reach.

2217
01:44:48,580 --> 01:44:50,240
I mean maybe he will when he's leaving.

2218
01:44:50,270 --> 01:44:52,260
Maybe we will once he leaves.

2219
01:44:52,280 --> 01:44:53,810
Maybe you can't when you're there.

2220
01:44:54,140 --> 01:44:54,973
I mean who knows.

2221
01:44:54,980 --> 01:44:58,100
I mean maybe it really is an
incredibly restrictive environment.

2222
01:44:58,130 --> 01:45:03,130
And he has no room to free ball and no
room to go outside of what they want him

2223
01:45:04,551 --> 01:45:06,230
to distribute as policy.

2224
01:45:06,290 --> 01:45:06,840
I don't know.

2225
01:45:06,840 --> 01:45:10,490
Mean I don't know what the fuck the
situation's like but if this world ever

2226
01:45:10,491 --> 01:45:15,491
needed someone to speak up and someone
to just make some fucking sense someone

2227
01:45:16,581 --> 01:45:21,581
to make some sense and not talk politics
you know not talk religion just talk

2228
01:45:21,830 --> 01:45:26,830
humanity not talk nationalistic not
talk conflict just make some sense.

2229
01:45:29,540 --> 01:45:34,540
Well I guess this is the you know this
the same bill was vetoed last year by the

2230
01:45:35,300 --> 01:45:40,300
White House and it looks like you know
it just it's one of those things that's

2231
01:45:40,431 --> 01:45:43,040
just poorly written and
everyone knows that type thing.

2232
01:45:43,100 --> 01:45:44,520
So so is the India.

2233
01:45:44,610 --> 01:45:47,630
Unfortunately pass really
hard through Congress.

2234
01:45:48,110 --> 01:45:51,080
The thing is it didn't pass as
hard in Congress the first time.

2235
01:45:51,620 --> 01:45:54,020
Well I think that I read
something about it this morning.

2236
01:45:54,140 --> 01:45:56,990
A lot of the way the government set
up and I'm obviously not an expert on

2237
01:45:56,991 --> 01:46:01,430
government but I know that a lot of the
the way it's set up is that you know we

2238
01:46:01,431 --> 01:46:06,431
have representatives and you know we
can't all be there while policy is being

2239
01:46:06,711 --> 01:46:10,340
dictated so our representatives go
there and they make sure that everything

2240
01:46:10,341 --> 01:46:14,990
represents their constituents but clearly
a better way to do all that is the

2241
01:46:14,991 --> 01:46:15,824
internet.

2242
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:17,970
If anybody had to be phased out.

2243
01:46:18,290 --> 01:46:22,430
Oh it's the majority of politicians
they're involved in making laws.

2244
01:46:22,790 --> 01:46:26,540
You could face those guys can
get all new jobs you know.

2245
01:46:26,660 --> 01:46:27,950
Have you seen House of Cards.

2246
01:46:28,190 --> 01:46:28,590
No.

2247
01:46:28,590 --> 01:46:29,270
She is awesome.

2248
01:46:29,270 --> 01:46:34,270
This show shows you what's
actually happening in
Washington following a real TV

2249
01:46:34,461 --> 01:46:34,910
show.

2250
01:46:34,910 --> 01:46:35,850
Oh somebody made up.

2251
01:46:36,230 --> 01:46:37,310
Oh it's unbelievable.

2252
01:46:38,180 --> 01:46:39,120
No shows you.

2253
01:46:39,150 --> 01:46:41,610
You realize what they're
what they're dealing with.

2254
01:46:41,630 --> 01:46:44,900
What they're actually doing
and it's all just it's.

2255
01:46:45,320 --> 01:46:46,070
Is it awesome.

2256
01:46:46,070 --> 01:46:46,903
It's all just deals.

2257
01:46:46,910 --> 01:46:50,480
The show's unbelievable I mean Kevin
Spacey already is a bad mother breaks the

2258
01:46:50,481 --> 01:46:53,270
third wall or whatever and just start
flicking at the camera telling you what

2259
01:46:53,271 --> 01:46:54,590
he's thinking in the middle of scenes.

2260
01:46:54,620 --> 01:46:55,160
It's pretty.

2261
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:55,820
It's really great.

2262
01:46:55,820 --> 01:46:59,600
Oh it's the there's everyone else freeze
in the background freeze like they're

2263
01:46:59,601 --> 01:47:01,530
playing the game sort of pretty much.

2264
01:47:01,570 --> 01:47:01,690
There's

2265
01:47:01,690 --> 01:47:06,020
still still the you know they blur out
but then it's just him just know it'll be

2266
01:47:06,040 --> 01:47:10,040
a cross meeting table from somebody like
here's what I'm about to do and they

2267
01:47:10,041 --> 01:47:11,780
don't know it but here's
how I'm going to do it.

2268
01:47:11,900 --> 01:47:12,733
Watch this.

2269
01:47:12,910 --> 01:47:16,070
Oh and it's amazing it's
really just politicking.

2270
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:20,210
You learn a lot about you know even show
business and networking overall from

2271
01:47:20,450 --> 01:47:23,060
how these politicians operate because
that's all that they're doing is playing

2272
01:47:23,061 --> 01:47:27,320
gossip games and texting and it's a
broken system and they're all criminals

2273
01:47:27,350 --> 01:47:28,670
keeping us from the Internet.

2274
01:47:28,940 --> 01:47:29,600
That's what it is.

2275
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:32,840
They're trying to tighten down on this
fuckin system and what they don't want to

2276
01:47:32,841 --> 01:47:37,010
do is admit that this could all be
handled way better with voting online.

2277
01:47:37,310 --> 01:47:38,210
Let's do it that way.

2278
01:47:38,480 --> 01:47:39,770
Every person has an I.D.

2279
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:40,461
every I.D.

2280
01:47:40,461 --> 01:47:42,440
is just like your fucking
social security card.

2281
01:47:42,500 --> 01:47:45,740
Yet only do it once boom
and you vote online.

2282
01:47:45,830 --> 01:47:46,663
Yep.

2283
01:47:46,730 --> 01:47:49,160
And when that happens
that's when things get good.

2284
01:47:49,220 --> 01:47:50,530
You can't control that bitch.

2285
01:47:50,930 --> 01:47:51,950
You can't you can't control that.

2286
01:47:51,980 --> 01:47:52,730
They'll deal.

2287
01:47:52,730 --> 01:47:54,140
They'll never allow something like that.

2288
01:47:54,170 --> 01:47:55,080
They will fight it till death.

2289
01:47:55,100 --> 01:47:57,610
That literally might be
where the revolution lies.

2290
01:47:57,810 --> 01:48:00,770
I is getting people to vote online because
they would essentially be giving up

2291
01:48:00,830 --> 01:48:05,830
all of their tricks but they've been
using over the past decades to manipulate

2292
01:48:06,110 --> 01:48:07,400
how ah ah ah.

2293
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:11,870
People are picked how our presidents
picked how laws are passed and all that

2294
01:48:11,871 --> 01:48:14,600
shit has been manipulated everything
should be done the popular vote now.

2295
01:48:14,980 --> 01:48:15,170
Yeah.

2296
01:48:15,170 --> 01:48:18,080
Isn't it a fascinating idea
that there would so try hard.

2297
01:48:18,130 --> 01:48:20,030
They would try so fucking hard to avoid.

2298
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:22,970
Yeah that would be like
a real tipping point.

2299
01:48:23,010 --> 01:48:26,130
This country will really realize
we're being run by vampires.

2300
01:48:26,490 --> 01:48:27,000
Oh yeah.

2301
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:31,320
Like how quickly they would fuckin shriek
into the dark corners of the room when

2302
01:48:31,321 --> 01:48:34,290
you open the drapes and take a
good look at the real scenario.

2303
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:36,420
Then I try to like give
the people what they want.

2304
01:48:36,450 --> 01:48:38,470
They're trying to profit
off the current system.

2305
01:48:38,970 --> 01:48:41,050
The current corrupt
system as in place got.

2306
01:48:41,270 --> 01:48:44,790
Tony you need to write your clean
young man you can run for president.

2307
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:48,960
You're very likeable could
probably pull it off.

2308
01:48:49,050 --> 01:48:49,650
You think you could.

2309
01:48:49,650 --> 01:48:52,650
There was a period of time when I was a
kid and I wanted to but you wanted to be

2310
01:48:52,651 --> 01:48:53,400
president at one point.

2311
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:54,390
Time for a little moment.

2312
01:48:54,450 --> 01:48:55,770
Did you fall on your head or something.

2313
01:48:56,910 --> 01:48:57,960
What made you want to be president.

2314
01:48:59,040 --> 01:48:59,700
How do you get sick.

2315
01:48:59,700 --> 01:49:00,420
We deliver now.

2316
01:49:00,420 --> 01:49:02,760
I thought it was just very very young.

2317
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:03,600
I thought it was going.

2318
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:04,680
Did you have the fever.

2319
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:05,460
Yeah.

2320
01:49:05,460 --> 01:49:06,300
The president's fever.

2321
01:49:06,380 --> 01:49:08,190
He had the president's fever.

2322
01:49:08,280 --> 01:49:12,420
You know when we all go through that
score and sixteen you're lying in your bed

2323
01:49:12,421 --> 01:49:13,254
dying.

2324
01:49:13,720 --> 01:49:14,690
Yeah I got obsessed with.

2325
01:49:15,210 --> 01:49:18,510
There was a period where as a kid I was
obsessed with like the Declaration of

2326
01:49:18,511 --> 01:49:20,640
Independence and how it
came to be in like a hole.

2327
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:21,090
I read it.

2328
01:49:21,090 --> 01:49:24,660
I remember reading a whole book about
John Hancock when I started practicing my

2329
01:49:24,661 --> 01:49:25,710
signature all the time.

2330
01:49:25,830 --> 01:49:29,670
I was obsessed with John and I thought
that was so cool that this guy had the

2331
01:49:29,671 --> 01:49:32,940
balls to be like here you
go here I am and I did this.

2332
01:49:33,180 --> 01:49:36,030
Who would be the first person to be
president that doesn't have the fake

2333
01:49:36,031 --> 01:49:40,950
president voice who'll be the first person
that just talks to everybody a person

2334
01:49:40,951 --> 01:49:45,951
who changes the world who doesn't have
a way of speaking with long vague pauses

2335
01:49:47,520 --> 01:49:50,640
when I believe what I believe for you.

2336
01:49:51,450 --> 01:49:55,890
And for me and for our great
nation is that we must unite.

2337
01:49:56,940 --> 01:50:01,410
Imagine if it is it's so bizarre that
fucking guy was over your house bitch why

2338
01:50:01,411 --> 01:50:02,244
are you talking like that.

2339
01:50:03,390 --> 01:50:06,750
Why are you talking this fake stupid
voice but you get away with that when it's

2340
01:50:06,751 --> 01:50:08,820
a big group of people
and you're a politician.

2341
01:50:09,150 --> 01:50:12,870
We know that you're talking in the
fake us most old school way possible.

2342
01:50:13,170 --> 01:50:15,210
You might as well be in
the theater you dummy.

2343
01:50:15,480 --> 01:50:18,030
It might as well be in the theater back
when they didn't have microphones when

2344
01:50:18,031 --> 01:50:20,040
they just have to shout
out their stupid lines.

2345
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:24,480
Imagine a strip club deejay being the
president just shook up deejay with no

2346
01:50:24,481 --> 01:50:28,590
microphones coming up to the main stage.

2347
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:30,350
It's time

2348
01:50:32,070 --> 01:50:36,240
and then a bunch of banjo players behind
have the music because you don't have

2349
01:50:36,241 --> 01:50:37,460
electricity do they.

2350
01:50:37,620 --> 01:50:39,840
I country at a bomb threat.

2351
01:50:41,130 --> 01:50:45,780
I got more information or more evidence
to the poor people that think that I'm

2352
01:50:46,140 --> 01:50:47,010
in league with the devil.

2353
01:50:47,490 --> 01:50:50,790
I wore this t shirt on Fox.

2354
01:50:51,030 --> 01:50:54,240
It was the Wild and Wonderful
Whites of West Virginia.

2355
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:58,980
They when I ordered the DVD they found
out we talked about on the podcast so the

2356
01:50:58,981 --> 01:51:02,610
people that make it they sent me these
cool T-shirts and one of them was that

2357
01:51:02,611 --> 01:51:07,590
famous picture of Nixon meeting Elvis
leather shaking hands but they replaced

2358
01:51:07,620 --> 01:51:12,000
Elvis's head with Jessica White and Nixon
with the devil himself and says like

2359
01:51:12,001 --> 01:51:17,001
the devil and so just go and I wore nuts
on Fox and I got like a hundred tweets

2360
01:51:17,011 --> 01:51:17,270
go.

2361
01:51:17,270 --> 01:51:19,620
What the fuck are you wearing on TV.

2362
01:51:20,010 --> 01:51:24,510
I didn't even think about it but for a
good portion of this knucklehead country.

2363
01:51:24,540 --> 01:51:29,540
If you have a shirt on that has a
devil's face it says the devil like these

2364
01:51:29,971 --> 01:51:34,971
dummies actually think that you like
you're you're down with the devil like the

2365
01:51:35,071 --> 01:51:40,071
devil and that's what that's where we
draw the line in this kooky country even

2366
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:45,320
even you know even religious people
like you can say that you believe in God

2367
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:48,750
you're allowed to say that you even
want to say that God talk to me.

2368
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:51,090
You know I saw a guy say that the
other day didn't even bother me.

2369
01:51:51,390 --> 01:51:53,490
There was a guy that was in Austin Texas.

2370
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:54,840
There was a guy that was at a red light.

2371
01:51:55,170 --> 01:51:55,860
He was begging.

2372
01:51:55,860 --> 01:51:57,210
He had a cardboard thing.

2373
01:51:57,600 --> 01:52:00,840
And the guy in the car rolled
down the window said Hey man.

2374
01:52:01,020 --> 01:52:02,920
God just talk to me and told
me I should give you this.

2375
01:52:02,950 --> 01:52:04,140
And he gave the guy 20 bucks.

2376
01:52:05,310 --> 01:52:10,220
That doesn't bother me but if the guys
roll down that window it Hey man I was

2377
01:52:10,221 --> 01:52:13,970
just speaking to Satan and he thought
you could use this to party with me.

2378
01:52:14,420 --> 01:52:17,890
You're not talking to Satan
anybody believes in Satan
as an asshole like you're

2379
01:52:17,900 --> 01:52:18,920
allowed to believe in God.

2380
01:52:19,240 --> 01:52:22,370
But if you say you believe in Satan
everybody tells you to go fuck yourself.

2381
01:52:22,610 --> 01:52:26,450
You have to be like way deep
in cuckoo for cocoa pops.

2382
01:52:26,810 --> 01:52:31,070
Oh you actually believe in Satan to
believe in to believe in the bad guy.

2383
01:52:31,910 --> 01:52:32,743
Yeah.

2384
01:52:33,110 --> 01:52:36,020
Have you ever met someone who actually
believed in Satan and you didn't know

2385
01:52:36,021 --> 01:52:37,790
that they believed in Satan
until you got to know them.

2386
01:52:38,130 --> 01:52:41,450
I mean you know like shit I feel like
I've met a couple of people that really

2387
01:52:41,451 --> 01:52:42,560
wanted to be different.

2388
01:52:43,580 --> 01:52:44,990
And I couldn't pull it off though.

2389
01:52:45,110 --> 01:52:49,810
You know they don't have the commitment
I met a girl once and she was with her

2390
01:52:49,811 --> 01:52:53,530
sister and it was total
innocent conversation.

2391
01:52:53,830 --> 01:52:56,250
You know nothing nothing crazy.

2392
01:52:56,380 --> 01:53:01,380
God said it was totally normal and she
brought up something I think it had to do

2393
01:53:01,901 --> 01:53:02,734
with gay marriage.

2394
01:53:03,160 --> 01:53:06,490
I think it had to do with that and it
was something about a bill being passed

2395
01:53:06,890 --> 01:53:10,780
and it was many many years ago so my
memory's a little foggy but I do remember

2396
01:53:10,781 --> 01:53:12,820
this whenever the controversy was.

2397
01:53:13,090 --> 01:53:15,640
She said she goes it's not God's way.

2398
01:53:16,390 --> 01:53:20,660
And I said I remember like stopping
and like all the sudden going whoa what

2399
01:53:20,780 --> 01:53:21,980
would happen with this conversation.

2400
01:53:22,010 --> 01:53:22,840
Like what did you just say.

2401
01:53:22,840 --> 01:53:24,070
It's not it's not God's way.

2402
01:53:24,610 --> 01:53:25,720
How do you know what God's way is.

2403
01:53:25,750 --> 01:53:27,010
Do you do you really talk to God.

2404
01:53:27,430 --> 01:53:28,360
Like where are you getting this from.

2405
01:53:28,660 --> 01:53:32,890
And she goes Oh that's Satan's
his scales have covered your eyes.

2406
01:53:33,610 --> 01:53:38,200
She actually said that to me his scales
have cut and I'll never forget me

2407
01:53:38,201 --> 01:53:40,980
looking at her and her sister
and god damn you crazy bitches.

2408
01:53:41,050 --> 01:53:41,883
Yeah.

2409
01:53:42,220 --> 01:53:42,730
And the girl was.

2410
01:53:42,730 --> 01:53:43,990
She was so pretty too.

2411
01:53:44,170 --> 01:53:45,490
Oh my God she's beautiful.

2412
01:53:46,480 --> 01:53:49,310
She was like Latin or something
like Donald's like oh crazy bitches.

2413
01:53:49,870 --> 01:53:50,790
Well you guys take care.

2414
01:53:50,870 --> 01:53:52,720
Just guys I was like we can't even talk.

2415
01:53:53,020 --> 01:53:55,930
You really think they're like Satanist
scales and he puts it over your eyes.

2416
01:53:56,530 --> 01:53:57,730
We have so much work to do here.

2417
01:53:57,970 --> 01:54:01,690
I'm not taking on this project like to
just just to communicate with you and get

2418
01:54:01,691 --> 01:54:04,570
you to a point of rational
objective thinking.

2419
01:54:05,310 --> 01:54:07,230
We take three for mushroom trips right.

2420
01:54:07,680 --> 01:54:09,560
Have you heard of a guy named Pier Popoff.

2421
01:54:10,030 --> 01:54:11,110
He's a pastor.

2422
01:54:11,270 --> 01:54:12,780
He's televangelist guys.

2423
01:54:12,970 --> 01:54:13,803
What did he do.

2424
01:54:13,810 --> 01:54:14,643
Blow some money.

2425
01:54:14,950 --> 01:54:18,280
I saw him the other day I watched I was
sleeping on the couch and I woke up in

2426
01:54:18,281 --> 01:54:23,281
his head when the shows are not paid
shows commercials and I was amazed what

2427
01:54:24,280 --> 01:54:26,820
woke me up because I was kind of like
half listening to while sleeping.

2428
01:54:27,140 --> 01:54:31,840
What was amazing how the things that they
sang it just seemed illegal like they

2429
01:54:31,841 --> 01:54:35,590
were like you like oh you know we're
gonna sing you some miracle water.

2430
01:54:35,620 --> 01:54:39,010
This water is you know miracle water
you're going to open up these envelopes.

2431
01:54:39,340 --> 01:54:42,760
And then they start showing
Mike testimonials like a
people and they're like You

2432
01:54:42,761 --> 01:54:45,190
know I sent in my or I read the letters.

2433
01:54:45,220 --> 01:54:49,510
And then just a week later I got a new
house in a car and then the next person

2434
01:54:49,511 --> 01:54:51,550
was like I got two
hundred thousand dollars.

2435
01:54:52,180 --> 01:54:55,300
And then his other one like a guy just
walked up and gave me a check for 15

2436
01:54:55,301 --> 01:54:58,660
million dollars and it was it
was like the most fake shit ever.

2437
01:54:58,930 --> 01:55:02,800
And so then I started really researching
this guy and there's all these videos

2438
01:55:02,801 --> 01:55:03,640
about him online.

2439
01:55:04,780 --> 01:55:08,560
I guess he's been ripping people off for
a long time and one of the best videos

2440
01:55:08,770 --> 01:55:12,960
is one where he just goes up and he goes
where's where so-and-so so-and-so is

2441
01:55:12,970 --> 01:55:13,320
here.

2442
01:55:13,320 --> 01:55:14,450
Let's let's say Tina.

2443
01:55:14,680 --> 01:55:15,280
Tina Fey.

2444
01:55:15,280 --> 01:55:15,670
Where are you.

2445
01:55:15,670 --> 01:55:16,390
Where are you.

2446
01:55:16,390 --> 01:55:20,620
And then she comes up because I heard you
have arthritis and you're here because

2447
01:55:20,621 --> 01:55:22,600
you wanna get rid of this
arthritis and stuff like that.

2448
01:55:22,680 --> 01:55:25,930
Oh the whole time his wife is
just pumping the whole show.

2449
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:26,260
Yeah.

2450
01:55:26,260 --> 01:55:29,230
She had a thing on it was on one of
those 20 20 Yeah I don't like that.

2451
01:55:29,410 --> 01:55:31,340
Yeah I know we talked
about this in the past.

2452
01:55:32,030 --> 01:55:35,290
I'm pretty sure maybe he's on another
podcast but I was amazed that he's still

2453
01:55:35,291 --> 01:55:36,040
allowed to do that.

2454
01:55:36,040 --> 01:55:37,480
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah.

2455
01:55:37,630 --> 01:55:38,463
Well that guy.

2456
01:55:40,110 --> 01:55:41,500
Well name one is not.

2457
01:55:42,240 --> 01:55:43,290
It's almost like it's.

2458
01:55:43,380 --> 01:55:44,350
That's so ridiculous.

2459
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:46,060
It's like the most ridiculous hustle ever.

2460
01:55:46,360 --> 01:55:47,120
It's like Who are they.

2461
01:55:47,120 --> 01:55:50,980
Tricking the LNP with a trick and
are like they're almost like mentally

2462
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:51,873
challenged.

2463
01:55:52,270 --> 01:55:52,810
Oh yeah.

2464
01:55:52,810 --> 01:55:53,980
People with no hope.

2465
01:55:54,070 --> 01:55:57,280
When you're when you're just robots
when you're down to being convinced that

2466
01:55:57,281 --> 01:56:00,730
there's a miracle water out there that
is going to come in the mail via the

2467
01:56:00,731 --> 01:56:04,780
postal service and it's going to it's
going to change your fortune right.

2468
01:56:04,930 --> 01:56:05,770
Yeah that's the one.

2469
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:07,330
One of these things.

2470
01:56:07,360 --> 01:56:10,870
Somewhere along the line they used to ask
for donations but then somewhere along

2471
01:56:10,871 --> 01:56:15,640
the line they they realized that they
could sell things and they started like

2472
01:56:15,970 --> 01:56:20,970
selling like holy water and selling like
prayer services and and telling people

2473
01:56:22,901 --> 01:56:24,880
that you would plant a seed.

2474
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:28,300
So if you spend ninety dollars
you Jill asked ninety dollars.

2475
01:56:28,390 --> 01:56:29,820
He would come back to you and tenfold.

2476
01:56:30,280 --> 01:56:34,880
The Bible says that would come out with
some crazy fucking was that the guy

2477
01:56:34,910 --> 01:56:36,050
Creflo Dollar.

2478
01:56:36,830 --> 01:56:39,950
He's my favorite because he's
got a dollar in his name.

2479
01:56:42,770 --> 01:56:45,320
I mean you're a pastor and
your fucking name is dollar.

2480
01:56:45,350 --> 01:56:45,800
What's your read.

2481
01:56:45,800 --> 01:56:47,220
They all have weird names like that.

2482
01:56:47,270 --> 01:56:49,100
Okay I guess it Good Peter Popoff.

2483
01:56:49,310 --> 01:56:51,860
Have you ever met any
other pop ups before.

2484
01:56:52,070 --> 01:56:53,990
This guy's got to have a
different real name now.

2485
01:56:54,770 --> 01:56:56,510
He must have a real name
what's his real name.

2486
01:56:57,320 --> 01:57:00,490
Wow his real name is Creflo
Augustus dollar Junior.

2487
01:57:01,190 --> 01:57:02,780
Wow this is real fucking name.

2488
01:57:03,390 --> 01:57:05,210
Can a Bachelor of Science and Education

2489
01:57:06,930 --> 01:57:09,820
Center talking shit smack in people.

2490
01:57:10,750 --> 01:57:12,010
My favorite Robert Tilden.

2491
01:57:12,070 --> 01:57:12,903
You know he is.

2492
01:57:13,200 --> 01:57:14,130
You've probably seen him.

2493
01:57:14,200 --> 01:57:17,290
There's a viral video of him farting.

2494
01:57:17,680 --> 01:57:21,280
Like he's like he talks in
tongues a lot on a show to Hugo.

2495
01:57:21,510 --> 01:57:25,710
Some like a chuckle love of my life
my life you know my you know my level.

2496
01:57:26,110 --> 01:57:26,980
It's hilarious.

2497
01:57:27,130 --> 01:57:30,850
See if you could pull up Robert Tilton
talking in tongues because it's some of

2498
01:57:30,851 --> 01:57:31,940
the most ridiculous shit ever.

2499
01:57:32,290 --> 01:57:35,920
But one I'll never forget this one thing
he said he said every time you write a

2500
01:57:35,921 --> 01:57:37,870
check to me Satan gets a black eye.

2501
01:57:38,500 --> 01:57:39,333
Wow.

2502
01:57:41,320 --> 01:57:45,310
But it doesn't part of you think that
if you're dumb enough to send him that

2503
01:57:45,311 --> 01:57:46,720
money like so what.

2504
01:57:46,990 --> 01:57:50,620
So a guy got you with the dumbest trick
of all time like you really thought that

2505
01:57:50,621 --> 01:57:51,550
money was going to gone.

2506
01:57:51,720 --> 01:57:53,960
You really thought that money is
gonna give the devil a black eye.

2507
01:57:54,600 --> 01:57:58,760
If you really thought that you're fucking
stupid or not looking after you right.

2508
01:57:58,900 --> 01:58:01,390
One of the Scott things
that this Peter Popoff does.

2509
01:58:01,510 --> 01:58:06,510
He also sends you a barley cake from the
Bible where it's like kind of like that

2510
01:58:07,420 --> 01:58:08,440
little bread you eat.

2511
01:58:08,740 --> 01:58:13,390
And he goes he goes in this commercial
he goes and we make it with the exact

2512
01:58:13,391 --> 01:58:16,510
ingredients that they say in
the Bible and blah blah blah.

2513
01:58:16,720 --> 01:58:21,720
Well then if you look up Ezekiel 412 in
the Bible it says and you should eat it

2514
01:58:22,030 --> 01:58:25,130
as barley cakes and bake it
using fuel of human waste.

2515
01:58:25,330 --> 01:58:26,960
So the human way.

2516
01:58:27,060 --> 01:58:27,380
So.

2517
01:58:27,380 --> 01:58:28,620
So wait a minute wait a minute wait.

2518
01:58:28,680 --> 01:58:29,513
No it doesn't.

2519
01:58:29,680 --> 01:58:32,410
You want that typing in a for 412.

2520
01:58:32,590 --> 01:58:33,920
OK easy.

2521
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:34,970
That's a Larry.

2522
01:58:34,970 --> 01:58:35,800
Hey I.

2523
01:58:35,800 --> 01:58:36,633
Hold on hold on.

2524
01:58:36,670 --> 01:58:41,670
Easy E K E L E for twenty
four to twelve for twelve.

2525
01:58:42,820 --> 01:58:43,000
Yeah.

2526
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:47,440
You're thinking about the we love but
he kill for twelve a long time since I

2527
01:58:47,441 --> 01:58:49,470
read up on my good old days he kills.

2528
01:58:49,720 --> 01:58:54,720
This is all new to me baking with Don
that comes out of man in their sight.

2529
01:58:57,390 --> 01:58:58,223
Hold it.

2530
01:58:58,480 --> 01:59:00,300
So he's saying hold on.

2531
01:59:00,680 --> 01:59:02,520
I can see our cooked fish.

2532
01:59:03,210 --> 01:59:04,043
Oh my God.

2533
01:59:04,080 --> 01:59:08,550
And thou shalt bake it with dung and
that comes out of man in their sight.

2534
01:59:09,480 --> 01:59:12,750
Well it's in the Bible it's in the Bible.

2535
01:59:12,830 --> 01:59:16,500
Why do you need to study the Bible
and cook you by hand with shit.

2536
01:59:17,370 --> 01:59:19,440
Have you ever tried my
poo poo barley cake.

2537
01:59:19,610 --> 01:59:21,600
Fucking imagine how dumb people are.

2538
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:23,160
That really hurts my brain.

2539
01:59:23,460 --> 01:59:26,940
Do you know Ezekiel Zeke might have been
tripper because his ego was also where

2540
01:59:26,941 --> 01:59:29,190
the first depictions of UFOs came from.

2541
01:59:29,600 --> 01:59:30,433
He only pulled out.

2542
01:59:30,660 --> 01:59:32,460
Yeah Zeke Hill was known for.

2543
01:59:32,620 --> 01:59:37,620
There's there's a Bible quote that
people bring up all the time was a UFO.

2544
01:59:39,170 --> 01:59:42,110
But people were seeing a lot
of things after eating a shit.

2545
01:59:42,210 --> 01:59:46,920
Mainly they're eaten fucking shit cakes
all day throwing out almost dying.

2546
01:59:47,310 --> 01:59:49,240
It was a wheel within a wheel.

2547
01:59:49,260 --> 01:59:50,770
It was God sharing it.

2548
01:59:50,940 --> 01:59:53,470
There was guys with boats
they had all the animals.

2549
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:56,070
You think we should prepare the
barley cake in a different way.

2550
01:59:56,130 --> 01:59:57,210
No no it's great.

2551
01:59:58,220 --> 01:59:59,640
I'm trying to find Jesus.

2552
02:00:00,060 --> 02:00:01,800
What a stupid fucking culture.

2553
02:00:02,220 --> 02:00:03,270
I cook it with shit.

2554
02:00:03,370 --> 02:00:05,400
Okay Dad should I write
that down on paper.

2555
02:00:05,580 --> 02:00:09,180
I put something in for violent my son
because I got so obsessed with this

2556
02:00:09,181 --> 02:00:13,500
minister that so when I found that out I
had tweeted something like Olive Garden

2557
02:00:13,501 --> 02:00:17,190
was like executive for 12 or something
like that and all these people got pissed

2558
02:00:17,191 --> 02:00:20,580
off that I was due to
doing Bible scriptures.

2559
02:00:20,730 --> 02:00:21,563
Oh that's hilarious.

2560
02:00:21,570 --> 02:00:22,620
Well they read that though.

2561
02:00:22,680 --> 02:00:23,610
Yeah they figured it out.

2562
02:00:23,700 --> 02:00:25,470
How do you not read that
and just start laughing.

2563
02:00:25,680 --> 02:00:27,270
Told me to cook shit cakes.

2564
02:00:27,500 --> 02:00:29,520
Fuck the Bible says Cook shit cakes.

2565
02:00:29,730 --> 02:00:31,530
That's just one more
dumb thing in the Bible.

2566
02:00:31,560 --> 02:00:34,170
God damn it I'm so tired of people
pretending that books are awesome.

2567
02:00:36,090 --> 02:00:39,270
I'm so tired you stop that shit stupid.

2568
02:00:39,760 --> 02:00:43,860
Okay here here's a here's a quote and I
looked and behold a whirlwind came out

2569
02:00:43,861 --> 02:00:48,861
of the North a great cloud and a fire in
folding itself in brightness was about

2570
02:00:50,371 --> 02:00:55,371
it and out of the midst thereof as the
color of Amber out of the midst of the

2571
02:00:56,161 --> 02:00:58,090
fire OK.

2572
02:00:58,180 --> 02:00:59,013
House audio file

2573
02:01:00,640 --> 02:01:01,300
hmm.

2574
02:01:01,300 --> 02:01:04,470
That's somebody putting
two points together.

2575
02:01:04,500 --> 02:01:06,840
They don't go together for oh
wait a minute this hold up.

2576
02:01:07,400 --> 02:01:11,310
And this also out of the midst there
of came the likeness of four living

2577
02:01:11,311 --> 02:01:13,800
creatures and this was their appearance.

2578
02:01:13,830 --> 02:01:15,540
They had the likeness of a man.

2579
02:01:16,220 --> 02:01:17,053
Whoa.

2580
02:01:17,580 --> 02:01:22,580
After everyone had four faces and everyone
had four wings and their feet were

2581
02:01:23,011 --> 02:01:27,780
straight and the sole of their feet was
like the soul of a calf's foot and they

2582
02:01:27,930 --> 02:01:31,260
sparkled like the color
of burnished brass.

2583
02:01:31,770 --> 02:01:32,940
What a trippy book.

2584
02:01:33,300 --> 02:01:34,890
People like Oh my God it's so real.

2585
02:01:35,550 --> 02:01:37,560
I hear God's words when
you're saying these things.

2586
02:01:38,100 --> 02:01:42,240
God is speaking to me through your words
please read on and they had the hands

2587
02:01:42,241 --> 02:01:46,980
of man under their wings on their four
sides and they had and therefore had

2588
02:01:46,981 --> 02:01:47,850
their faces in their ways.

2589
02:01:47,970 --> 02:01:52,970
Somebody might have just made all this
up and me like an asshole is reading this

2590
02:01:53,160 --> 02:01:57,060
fake Bible quote shitting all
over the Bible and the aliens.

2591
02:01:57,090 --> 02:01:57,870
But guess what.

2592
02:01:57,870 --> 02:01:58,703
I don't care.

2593
02:01:58,840 --> 02:02:00,000
I'm not reading any further.

2594
02:02:00,400 --> 02:02:05,400
It seems like if this is if this really
is as it kills it says it is God damn

2595
02:02:05,851 --> 02:02:06,070
it.

2596
02:02:06,070 --> 02:02:07,050
I think it's all nuttiness.

2597
02:02:07,120 --> 02:02:10,410
They walked up with their four faces
and they said Why are you guys cooking

2598
02:02:10,411 --> 02:02:11,310
things in shit.

2599
02:02:11,730 --> 02:02:15,420
And the living creatures ran and
returned as the appearance of a flash of

2600
02:02:15,421 --> 02:02:16,254
lightning.

2601
02:02:16,260 --> 02:02:20,190
Now as I behold the living creatures
behold one wheel upon the earth by the

2602
02:02:20,191 --> 02:02:22,770
living creatures with his four faces.

2603
02:02:23,190 --> 02:02:25,220
These guys were tripping hard eating shit.

2604
02:02:25,350 --> 02:02:27,090
Kingsley yeah losing their mind.

2605
02:02:27,270 --> 02:02:28,260
What grows on shit.

2606
02:02:29,380 --> 02:02:30,330
Mushroom that's right.

2607
02:02:30,360 --> 02:02:32,850
Leave your shit takes out
the cover with mushrooms.

2608
02:02:33,300 --> 02:02:35,130
Eat your shit cakes chip your balls off.

2609
02:02:36,060 --> 02:02:37,360
Stop talking nutty man.

2610
02:02:38,460 --> 02:02:43,460
When those went these went and when those
stood still these stood and when those

2611
02:02:43,651 --> 02:02:46,290
were lifted up from the earth
the wheels were lifted up.

2612
02:02:46,320 --> 02:02:48,380
That guy is this glass all alien.

2613
02:02:48,720 --> 02:02:49,980
That guy is just that's word salad.

2614
02:02:50,040 --> 02:02:51,000
That guy's high as fuck.

2615
02:02:51,480 --> 02:02:53,430
He just ramblin high as fuck.

2616
02:02:53,460 --> 02:02:57,210
I said the same thing in Joshua Tree one
time and this is the stuff by the way

2617
02:02:57,211 --> 02:02:59,490
that they kept in you know.

2618
02:02:59,550 --> 02:03:03,150
I mean think about that like especially
in the New Testament the New Testament.

2619
02:03:03,180 --> 02:03:06,840
They they had to like have like
meetings inside Ed what's in there.

2620
02:03:07,110 --> 02:03:07,320
Yeah.

2621
02:03:07,320 --> 02:03:11,510
Leave this if you look at two crazy if
you look at that is it go for twelve

2622
02:03:11,520 --> 02:03:11,820
quote.

2623
02:03:11,820 --> 02:03:15,810
Now it's totally changed has nothing
to do like really lately different.

2624
02:03:15,870 --> 02:03:19,140
Oh they've altered the quote Well you
know it also it's probably so hard.

2625
02:03:19,330 --> 02:03:20,960
You should talk to a linguist right.

2626
02:03:21,090 --> 02:03:25,260
You know I talked to a language scholar
the other day ironically enough for a

2627
02:03:25,261 --> 02:03:26,094
Bigfoot show.

2628
02:03:26,640 --> 02:03:31,640
And if you talked to a linguist they'll
tell you that it started off it was a

2629
02:03:32,461 --> 02:03:36,420
spoken story for the longest time
before anyone even wrote it down.

2630
02:03:36,690 --> 02:03:40,770
And the the bible must many of the stories
in the Bible probably existed before

2631
02:03:40,771 --> 02:03:43,500
language or before written language.

2632
02:03:44,010 --> 02:03:48,690
So like like a lot of the stories in the
Bible also they're like really similar

2633
02:03:48,691 --> 02:03:50,700
to the same stories of
ancient Mesopotamia.

2634
02:03:50,820 --> 02:03:51,240
Oh yeah.

2635
02:03:51,240 --> 02:03:55,110
Like somewhere and like the epic of
Gilgamesh is like really close to the epic

2636
02:03:55,111 --> 02:03:56,160
of Noah Noah's Ark.

2637
02:03:56,190 --> 02:03:58,330
It's like it's really like
a lot of similarities.

2638
02:03:58,390 --> 02:03:59,550
Yeah in a lot of the stories.

2639
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:04,440
So they had to write it down the road
down and probably let's say the first ship

2640
02:04:04,441 --> 02:04:08,070
was the Sumerians so they wrote it down
and I think it's called cuneiform or

2641
02:04:08,071 --> 02:04:08,904
cuneiform.

2642
02:04:08,970 --> 02:04:13,470
They wrote it down then and
then eventually it became
ancient Hebrew and then

2643
02:04:13,530 --> 02:04:18,530
they're going to translate it ancient
Hebrew to Latin and then as translated to

2644
02:04:18,540 --> 02:04:23,540
Greek as translated to English like
they had to fuck it up in a lot of ways

2645
02:04:24,151 --> 02:04:24,984
along the way.

2646
02:04:25,080 --> 02:04:27,660
When you deal with some
wacky ass languages.

2647
02:04:28,350 --> 02:04:31,740
Q Matt I mean how many people even exist
and know how to convert all that shit.

2648
02:04:32,340 --> 02:04:34,140
Yeah I mean languages are lost.

2649
02:04:34,270 --> 02:04:34,590
Yeah.

2650
02:04:34,590 --> 02:04:38,700
And when they go over the the dead
sea scrolls is the real trip factory.

2651
02:04:39,120 --> 02:04:42,720
Read some of the shit that's in the dead
sea scrolls the dead sea scrolls of the

2652
02:04:42,750 --> 02:04:47,750
oldest version of the Bible by far by
almost a thousand years I think it was

2653
02:04:47,761 --> 02:04:52,761
found in a place called Kumbh Ron in these
these caves in the side of a mountain

2654
02:04:53,491 --> 02:04:58,160
like a side of a hill and these caves
have these clay pots and in them with

2655
02:04:58,161 --> 02:05:01,530
these they literally made out of animal
skins and it's the oldest stories of the

2656
02:05:01,531 --> 02:05:06,531
Bible and it's all trippy fucking shit
it's all you read it and you go it makes

2657
02:05:07,981 --> 02:05:10,270
Ezekiel sound normal right.

2658
02:05:10,860 --> 02:05:14,850
And it's so nutty that even though it's
the oldest version of the Bible they're

2659
02:05:14,851 --> 02:05:17,310
very resistant to release it.

2660
02:05:17,670 --> 02:05:20,790
And I like to say oh we're going to
revise the bible now according to the dead

2661
02:05:20,791 --> 02:05:21,624
sea scrolls.

2662
02:05:21,650 --> 02:05:22,483
They're like you know what.

2663
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:23,850
We've been reading this for a while.

2664
02:05:23,890 --> 02:05:26,130
Maybe we need to fucking
just bury this bitch

2665
02:05:27,700 --> 02:05:32,700
because that's where that guy John Marco
Allegro who's the the dead sea scrolls

2666
02:05:35,691 --> 02:05:36,230
guy.

2667
02:05:36,230 --> 02:05:38,870
He was like the head translator
for the dead sea scrolls.

2668
02:05:39,140 --> 02:05:40,610
He said the whole thing
was about mushrooms.

2669
02:05:41,160 --> 02:05:44,480
He his he wrote a book called
The Sacred mushroom in the cross.

2670
02:05:44,960 --> 02:05:48,950
He was the only scholar on the whole
dead sea scrolls committee that was

2671
02:05:49,240 --> 02:05:50,060
agnostic.

2672
02:05:50,060 --> 02:05:53,660
He was ordained minister but then studying
theology realized it was horseshit

2673
02:05:53,950 --> 02:05:54,783
leaving booboo.

2674
02:05:55,220 --> 02:05:55,830
Yeah.

2675
02:05:55,830 --> 02:05:57,890
Say goodbye the people by guys.

2676
02:05:57,950 --> 02:05:59,760
We're gonna we're going to
wrap this up soon anyway.

2677
02:05:59,970 --> 02:06:00,803
We're gonna get out of here too.

2678
02:06:00,830 --> 02:06:03,260
I got to go see the premiere of serious.

2679
02:06:03,540 --> 02:06:08,060
Dr. Steven Greer documentary where he
reveals the truth about the tiny little

2680
02:06:08,061 --> 02:06:11,740
alien baby and whether or not
it came from the planet Uranus.

2681
02:06:11,870 --> 02:06:15,260
We please text me

2682
02:06:15,290 --> 02:06:16,610

2686
02:06:21,980 --> 02:06:25,010
I will save the rest of it
for when we talk on air.

2687
02:06:25,400 --> 02:06:28,880
So do not expect live tweets or spoilers.

2688
02:06:29,750 --> 02:06:33,380
I'm fascinated I actually talked to a
really cool guy today at a video game

2689
02:06:33,381 --> 02:06:36,320
company that saw it last night
and he said is really interesting.

2690
02:06:37,130 --> 02:06:40,390
So many get high as fuck and
we'll see what's up later buddy.

2691
02:06:40,670 --> 02:06:42,080
I see tomorrow man George S.

2692
02:06:42,081 --> 02:06:42,914
Myanmar.

2693
02:06:43,270 --> 02:06:44,103
Yeah.

2694
02:06:44,150 --> 02:06:45,680
So this dead sea scrolls.

2695
02:06:46,550 --> 02:06:51,550
This guy John Marco Allegro said after
like 14 years of study that the entire

2696
02:06:52,281 --> 02:06:57,110
Christian religion was really about
fertility rituals and mushrooms.

2697
02:06:58,010 --> 02:07:01,790
It was about tripping balls on psychedelic
mushrooms and it was about fertility

2698
02:07:01,791 --> 02:07:06,791
treatments and fertility festivals and
that they would fertility rituals and

2699
02:07:07,311 --> 02:07:11,660
that like becoming pregnant was like
the most important thing like keeping a

2700
02:07:11,661 --> 02:07:15,830
baby alive is really difficult
and becoming pregnant and
having you know a child

2701
02:07:15,840 --> 02:07:17,770
was like the most important
thing to look forward to.

2702
02:07:17,810 --> 02:07:22,810
Like there was a serious urgency to having
children because people were fragile

2703
02:07:23,240 --> 02:07:28,240
you know and they also knew a lot about
the indigenous psychedelic plants and

2704
02:07:30,351 --> 02:07:34,070
especially what they think the Amanita
miscarry mushroom he thinks was one of

2705
02:07:34,071 --> 02:07:37,190
the big ones that these people just didn't
want anybody else to know about it so

2706
02:07:37,191 --> 02:07:38,300
they hid their stories.

2707
02:07:38,660 --> 02:07:43,660
They hit him in parables and you know
they hid the how they know what their

2708
02:07:44,331 --> 02:07:46,280
history of the use of this stuff.

2709
02:07:46,700 --> 02:07:49,220
Really interesting stuff that I'm way
too stupid to understand whether he's

2710
02:07:49,221 --> 02:07:51,140
right or whether the
other people are right.

2711
02:07:51,470 --> 02:07:55,640
But the guy is a legit scholar you know
he's not a stoner he's not like one of

2712
02:07:55,641 --> 02:07:57,390
those guys is trying to
justify mushroom use.

2713
02:07:57,430 --> 02:08:02,430
There is something the Times that I've
tried mushrooms in which I know it sounds

2714
02:08:02,991 --> 02:08:05,480
stereotypical but I really
think there's something there.

2715
02:08:05,780 --> 02:08:10,780
I mean there's like definitely beyond
science and rationale and what I've been

2716
02:08:11,421 --> 02:08:16,160
told to expect in this and that there's
something there's something extra wild

2717
02:08:16,161 --> 02:08:21,161
about him and you know nothing's really
that great as when you can really enjoy

2718
02:08:24,081 --> 02:08:24,710
that.

2719
02:08:24,710 --> 02:08:29,710
Yeah and and it makes for everything I
mean luckily you know they're finally

2720
02:08:30,621 --> 02:08:34,100
coming out with these studies that are
showing what it's doing for depression

2721
02:08:34,101 --> 02:08:39,101
and anxiety and it's it's super natural
cure at times for people even with what

2722
02:08:42,201 --> 02:08:43,034
they called.

2723
02:08:43,850 --> 02:08:46,390
What are they come when
it's a lifelong diagnosis.

2724
02:08:47,060 --> 02:08:48,110
Chronic depression.

2725
02:08:48,260 --> 02:08:51,710
I mean people have bounced out of it
when they thought that they were going to

2726
02:08:51,711 --> 02:08:54,920
be miserable for the rest of their
lives it's like Oh thanks a real

2727
02:08:54,921 --> 02:08:59,921
consciousness reset on a real life a
real one not not not just like blowing on

2728
02:09:00,021 --> 02:09:03,350
your hand and pretending you feel
better it's it's real it's legit.

2729
02:09:04,300 --> 02:09:07,940
Listen to some of the shit that's
in the dead sea scrolls by the way.

2730
02:09:08,190 --> 02:09:10,910
There is people that are working really
hard to try to turn that around as of

2731
02:09:10,930 --> 02:09:15,450
the John Hopkins study and yeah my
friend Aubrey was just at maps the

2732
02:09:15,890 --> 02:09:19,430
psychedelic meaning whatever the hell
it is I forget what the what it was I

2733
02:09:19,431 --> 02:09:20,390
stand for maps.

2734
02:09:22,240 --> 02:09:27,240
Same map psychedelic I should know
because they're doing a lot of really good

2735
02:09:27,911 --> 02:09:32,800
work and letting people know it Intel
multidisciplinary Association for

2736
02:09:32,801 --> 02:09:36,280
Psychedelic Studies and you know they're
they're hitting them with hard science

2737
02:09:36,281 --> 02:09:39,280
over and over and over again and showing
how many people it can be beneficial

2738
02:09:39,281 --> 02:09:43,120
for which model and a lot of people that
are trying to hold back those people

2739
02:09:43,121 --> 02:09:44,200
that are trying to hold it back.

2740
02:09:44,230 --> 02:09:48,040
It would be beneficial to them as well
so people don't understand is that your

2741
02:09:48,041 --> 02:09:53,041
desire for your resistance to
psychedelics is the very reason you need

2742
02:09:53,471 --> 02:09:54,670
psychedelics in the first place.

2743
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,910
If you really understood what you were
resisting like you're really holding God

2744
02:09:57,911 --> 02:10:00,190
back you really you really
want to believe in God.

2745
02:10:00,700 --> 02:10:02,530
Take 6 grams of mushrooms you'll see him.

2746
02:10:02,980 --> 02:10:04,350
Yeah you really party with them.

2747
02:10:04,390 --> 02:10:05,150
You'll hang out with them.

2748
02:10:05,150 --> 02:10:07,540
Dude DMV you'll have
you'll meet God for sure.

2749
02:10:08,230 --> 02:10:11,680
You say it sounds crazy it sounds like
an idiot saying it and I agree it's I.

2750
02:10:11,770 --> 02:10:13,000
It sounds like an idiot it's me.

2751
02:10:13,570 --> 02:10:18,570
I agree with you but I think it's probably
exactly what Zeke was talking about

2752
02:10:19,091 --> 02:10:19,750
in that story.

2753
02:10:19,750 --> 02:10:20,830
But he was tripping his balls off.

2754
02:10:20,950 --> 02:10:21,400
Oh yeah.

2755
02:10:21,400 --> 02:10:25,180
He had some crazy psychedelic experience
you probably ate some mushrooms or or

2756
02:10:25,360 --> 02:10:30,360
you know the Moses burning bush scholars
to this day actively in in Jerusalem

2757
02:10:32,111 --> 02:10:32,260
there.

2758
02:10:32,260 --> 02:10:36,370
There's a movement for
scholars to recognize the
possibility that Moses was on

2759
02:10:36,371 --> 02:10:37,360
psychedelic drugs.

2760
02:10:37,960 --> 02:10:41,830
And that's one of the reasons why it's
all a burning bush like one of the big

2761
02:10:41,831 --> 02:10:46,650
bushes that they that they associate
with that area as the acacia tree the

2762
02:10:46,750 --> 02:10:49,360
acacia Bush rich and DMC.

2763
02:10:50,050 --> 02:10:53,260
And if that doesn't mean that if they
figured out how to extract that shit and

2764
02:10:53,261 --> 02:10:55,480
smoke it burning bush is right there.

2765
02:10:55,540 --> 02:10:56,350
Yeah he met God.

2766
02:10:56,350 --> 02:10:58,730
He found out the 10 you know it sounds
like what God would say of your high end

2767
02:10:58,740 --> 02:11:01,600
EMT all those ten commandments
they sound pretty right.

2768
02:11:01,630 --> 02:11:01,870
Yeah.

2769
02:11:01,870 --> 02:11:03,010
Don't fuck your neighbor's wife.

2770
02:11:03,310 --> 02:11:04,143
Don't kill him.

2771
02:11:04,630 --> 02:11:05,200
Be nice.

2772
02:11:05,200 --> 02:11:08,740
Yeah it sounds like would be empty with
W like it literally is exactly what

2773
02:11:08,741 --> 02:11:09,160
D.N.A.

2774
02:11:09,160 --> 02:11:09,670
would tell you.

2775
02:11:09,670 --> 02:11:13,480
Translated to the filters of time
thousands of years of various languages.

2776
02:11:13,510 --> 02:11:16,330
But if some guy had some breakthrough
experience back then I was trying to

2777
02:11:16,570 --> 02:11:17,920
enlighten all the people around him.

2778
02:11:18,280 --> 02:11:19,060
That's what he would say.

2779
02:11:19,060 --> 02:11:20,440
I came back from God.

2780
02:11:20,470 --> 02:11:25,470
God gave me this message and then over X
amount of years of idiots talking about

2781
02:11:25,541 --> 02:11:26,374
it would not know.

2782
02:11:26,540 --> 02:11:28,960
Wrote it on stone tablets.

2783
02:11:29,150 --> 02:11:30,710
Well how did he know it was God's word.

2784
02:11:30,830 --> 02:11:31,990
Well God gave him.

2785
02:11:32,230 --> 02:11:36,650
Giants don't mean when people exaggerate
and tell stories of course good a

2786
02:11:36,651 --> 02:11:40,420
thousand years of people explaining what
happened they're going to fuck it up

2787
02:11:40,421 --> 02:11:42,370
and butcher it just makes sense.

2788
02:11:42,850 --> 02:11:44,990
What was the name of
that Mel Brooks movie.

2789
02:11:45,010 --> 02:11:48,340
It's one of my favorite scenes in comedy
history with Mel Brooks is playing

2790
02:11:48,341 --> 02:11:51,160
Moses and he comes around
the corner at three tablets.

2791
02:11:51,890 --> 02:11:56,890
My Lord I give you these 15 and he
drops the one these ten commandments.

2792
02:11:57,850 --> 02:11:58,540
Yeah.

2793
02:11:58,540 --> 02:11:59,920
So funny.

2794
02:12:01,180 --> 02:12:04,600
This is a this is a fucking fascinating.

2795
02:12:04,630 --> 02:12:09,630
These quotes I mean again I can't tell
you if these quotes are really from the

2796
02:12:11,411 --> 02:12:14,460
actual dead sea scrolls but it's

2797
02:12:16,380 --> 02:12:18,280
it's really wild crazy shit.

2798
02:12:18,800 --> 02:12:23,800
It's it's it's hard to understand how
you translate things to English because

2799
02:12:23,891 --> 02:12:24,520
it's not.

2800
02:12:24,520 --> 02:12:29,440
You're also trying to like display the
intent with a completely different style

2801
02:12:29,441 --> 02:12:30,370
of communicating.

2802
02:12:30,820 --> 02:12:34,600
You know like this style of communicating
that they had back then is probably so

2803
02:12:34,630 --> 02:12:39,310
alien to us like socially and so they
try to alter it to get it to fit and how

2804
02:12:39,311 --> 02:12:42,100
we feel they would communicate
if they lived today.

2805
02:12:43,510 --> 02:12:44,343
Yeah.

2806
02:12:47,080 --> 02:12:51,040
Many will attempt to steal your crown and
rob you of your joy but they can never

2807
02:12:51,041 --> 02:12:53,620
succeed because of my presence with you.

2808
02:12:54,190 --> 02:12:57,640
What you have hidden in the deep recesses
of your heart can never be removed by

2809
02:12:57,641 --> 02:12:58,870
the enemy of your soul.

2810
02:12:59,200 --> 02:13:04,150
Maintain a strong faith in me and my
word and you shall never perish but enjoy

2811
02:13:04,151 --> 02:13:06,790
life everlasting which
I have provided you.

2812
02:13:07,030 --> 02:13:08,080
That's sounds like a cult leader.

2813
02:13:08,370 --> 02:13:11,640
It sounds like a dude is trying to get
his dick sucked and he knows where all

2814
02:13:11,641 --> 02:13:12,474
the gold is

2815
02:13:14,120 --> 02:13:15,580
yeah life everlasting.

2816
02:13:15,620 --> 02:13:17,090
That's a hard promise to keep.

2817
02:13:18,200 --> 02:13:20,110
Who knows if that's what
it's really said though.

2818
02:13:20,570 --> 02:13:24,320
That's the really fascinating stuff
about all this really ancient shit.

2819
02:13:24,380 --> 02:13:29,380
It's like piecing together the past so
fucking hard to figure out when anybody

2820
02:13:30,501 --> 02:13:35,180
really said like this stuff that I've
been telling you about this Dan Carlin's

2821
02:13:35,181 --> 02:13:37,760
Hardcore History that I've been listening
to for the past couple of months.

2822
02:13:38,840 --> 02:13:41,900
They don't even know what gang is kind
of looked like they don't only look like

2823
02:13:41,930 --> 02:13:43,040
they don't know where they buried them.

2824
02:13:43,430 --> 02:13:46,130
They don't they they don't have
any direct quotes from him.

2825
02:13:46,690 --> 02:13:51,380
They have quotes from like people that
met with like Russian historians like

2826
02:13:51,410 --> 02:13:56,410
emissaries and you know diplomats that
met to like demand things before they you

2827
02:13:58,041 --> 02:14:00,050
know for the Mongols descended upon them.

2828
02:14:00,920 --> 02:14:05,920
Shit I read I read a thing about that
exactly that they hired like 50 people to

2829
02:14:06,591 --> 02:14:11,591
bury gang is gone and then they hired 100
people to kill those 50 people so that

2830
02:14:12,320 --> 02:14:16,610
nobody knew where he was buried and
then they hired 500 people to kill those

2831
02:14:16,611 --> 02:14:20,240
hundred people that killed the 50 people
in case any of them told them a thing

2832
02:14:20,280 --> 02:14:24,320
you know and they would just ambush these
groups of people that were under their

2833
02:14:24,321 --> 02:14:28,180
own command in order to protect
the secret of gang is gone.

2834
02:14:28,490 --> 02:14:29,570
They're bad motherfuckers.

2835
02:14:29,630 --> 02:14:32,210
They were willing to take it to a level
that human beings today could never

2836
02:14:32,211 --> 02:14:33,044
conceive of.

2837
02:14:33,050 --> 02:14:38,050
That's all I do now as I absorb all these
these this is history is unbelievable

2838
02:14:38,631 --> 02:14:39,050
to me.

2839
02:14:39,050 --> 02:14:44,050
And now with the Internet you can go
non stop tangent to tangent to tangent.

2840
02:14:44,150 --> 02:14:46,350
You can forget what
originally got you there.

2841
02:14:46,370 --> 02:14:50,810
Next thing you could just be on the
different scope of the universe.

2842
02:14:50,840 --> 02:14:55,840
But for some reason like tragic events
of twelve A.D. don't bother me as much as

2843
02:14:57,681 --> 02:14:59,630
like Boston of 2013.

2844
02:14:59,690 --> 02:15:02,270
Like I stopped reading
about the Boston tragedy.

2845
02:15:02,770 --> 02:15:05,510
Like I don't want to you know I'm hearing
about this guy lost his legs and this

2846
02:15:05,511 --> 02:15:09,230
people you know these people
were permanently injured
and this person died and

2847
02:15:09,260 --> 02:15:11,510
it's you know it's so depressing.

2848
02:15:11,780 --> 02:15:14,990
But for whatever reason I can read about
gangs can't or listen to this audiotape

2849
02:15:15,020 --> 02:15:15,853
bugging his car.

2850
02:15:15,860 --> 02:15:16,693
It doesn't bother me.

2851
02:15:17,480 --> 02:15:18,200
Yeah.

2852
02:15:18,200 --> 02:15:19,650
Sweet don't know how.

2853
02:15:20,430 --> 02:15:25,070
People are terrible they're capable
of such horrible horrible behavior.

2854
02:15:25,640 --> 02:15:26,150
We don't know.

2855
02:15:26,150 --> 02:15:28,190
We're not used to or
not around that often.

2856
02:15:28,740 --> 02:15:31,040
You have to see something
happen to just understand.

2857
02:15:31,100 --> 02:15:34,050
Oh yeah there's some of us out there
that are just fucking nuts right.

2858
02:15:34,850 --> 02:15:37,700
It's just in in in the
evolution of things.

2859
02:15:37,910 --> 02:15:42,200
It's hard to it's hard to get all the
way clear after a thousand years ago the

2860
02:15:42,201 --> 02:15:46,490
Mongol Lloyds were killing
tens of thousands of Mongol
Lloyd's great well with

2861
02:15:46,491 --> 02:15:47,750
long goals whatever

2862
02:15:49,370 --> 02:15:51,800
you can say whatever man they'll
come they'll come get you.

2863
02:15:52,350 --> 02:15:53,720
The thing is China's like their hero.

2864
02:15:54,620 --> 02:15:57,770
I mean imagine like that's that's
a guy that's in your your past.

2865
02:15:57,800 --> 02:15:58,460
You know we talk right.

2866
02:15:58,460 --> 02:16:00,200
What did what did your ancestors do.

2867
02:16:00,260 --> 02:16:00,890
Oh really.

2868
02:16:00,890 --> 02:16:05,790
My answer was getting his fuck my ancestor
killed everybody because King is Khan

2869
02:16:05,820 --> 02:16:10,520
fucked so many people that
he's responsible for a giant
percentage of the DNA in

2870
02:16:10,521 --> 02:16:15,200
that area like he's in something like 5
percent his DNA is in some I just made

2871
02:16:15,201 --> 02:16:15,700
that number up.

2872
02:16:15,700 --> 02:16:15,830
By

2873
02:16:15,830 --> 02:16:18,830
the way I'm going to google it okay
because it's not another fucking important

2874
02:16:18,910 --> 02:16:19,743
one of my historian.

2875
02:16:19,910 --> 02:16:20,743
Go look for yourself you.

2876
02:16:21,440 --> 02:16:25,430
If you want to find out get get that
Dan Carlin's Hardcore History I can't

2877
02:16:25,431 --> 02:16:29,060
recommend it enough the guy
puts a tremendous amount
of work in these podcasts I

2878
02:16:29,061 --> 02:16:33,760
really respect his work ethic I'm not
I'm fuckin fascinated by man Genghis Khan

2879
02:16:33,920 --> 02:16:38,230
motherfucker dude I'm saying Tony
Hinchcliffe Oh yeah definitely.

2880

So well what's next for you buddy.

2881
02:16:40,490 --> 02:16:43,050

2884
02:16:49,860 --> 02:16:50,710
I'm very excited.

2885
02:16:51,140 --> 02:16:51,973
We're gonna have some fun.

2886
02:16:52,090 --> 02:16:52,900
Mm hmm mm hmm.

2887
02:16:52,900 --> 02:16:53,733
What else is going on for you.

2888
02:16:53,800 --> 02:16:55,120
Still working on Jeff Ross's show.

2889
02:16:55,630 --> 02:16:57,250
Yeah we're in between seasons right now.

2890
02:16:57,370 --> 02:16:59,380
Hopefully Season 3 will be really soon.

2891
02:16:59,740 --> 02:17:02,470
The burn on Comedy Central and
you're one of the writers over there.

2892
02:17:02,590 --> 02:17:02,920
Yeah.

2893
02:17:02,920 --> 02:17:06,850
So if you see something really offensive
most likely that guy wrote it you know

2894
02:17:06,880 --> 02:17:08,260
who did it Tony Hinchcliffe.

2895
02:17:08,350 --> 02:17:09,250
He doesn't give a fuck.

2896
02:17:09,700 --> 02:17:12,070
Even if I didn't write for it I
fought for it to be on the show.

2897
02:17:12,160 --> 02:17:13,120
He's born gangster.

2898
02:17:13,270 --> 02:17:14,950
Look at that look at him.

2899
02:17:15,070 --> 02:17:17,380
It's true I not give a fuck.

2900
02:17:19,120 --> 02:17:22,230
Came out here from Ohio to
make it in the dark world.

2901
02:17:22,590 --> 02:17:23,220
It's true.

2902
02:17:23,220 --> 02:17:27,240
What you from Columbus originally from
Youngstown and a town in Italian city

2903
02:17:27,241 --> 02:17:28,720
between Chicago and New York.

2904
02:17:28,770 --> 02:17:29,430
I know where that is.

2905
02:17:29,430 --> 02:17:30,263
I did comedy there.

2906
02:17:30,600 --> 02:17:31,680
I did comedy in this club.

2907
02:17:31,710 --> 02:17:32,543
The funny farm.

2908
02:17:32,640 --> 02:17:33,150
Yeah.

2909
02:17:33,150 --> 02:17:36,630
And they had theirs there's the stages
in the bag and there's a disco in the

2910
02:17:36,631 --> 02:17:41,631
front and the disco was like
well it wasn't the highest end.

2911
02:17:41,850 --> 02:17:43,400
This guy you know not a holiday.

2912
02:17:43,550 --> 02:17:44,180
Yeah yeah.

2913
02:17:44,180 --> 02:17:44,540
Yeah.

2914
02:17:44,540 --> 02:17:47,900
And there was like all this music was
playing every time the back door would

2915
02:17:47,930 --> 02:17:48,320
open.

2916
02:17:48,320 --> 02:17:49,153
You would hear

2917
02:17:51,130 --> 02:17:51,963
it

2918
02:17:53,260 --> 02:17:55,410
and then it would close and
then you'd go back to your act.

2919
02:17:55,420 --> 02:17:55,520
It

2920
02:17:55,520 --> 02:17:56,720
would be like literally this quiet.

2921
02:17:57,080 --> 02:17:58,070
And the door would open.

2922
02:17:58,100 --> 02:18:00,750
So it's just constant
open and shut into pee.

2923
02:18:00,820 --> 02:18:05,630
You had to go that way I think yeah
I might have made that up to now.

2924
02:18:06,150 --> 02:18:07,280
No it wasn't a good gig.

2925
02:18:07,460 --> 02:18:10,360
That club was notoriously like.

2926
02:18:11,240 --> 02:18:12,020
Not really.

2927
02:18:12,020 --> 02:18:12,853
Did you ever do it.

2928
02:18:12,890 --> 02:18:13,700
No.

2929
02:18:13,700 --> 02:18:14,180
Never.

2930
02:18:14,180 --> 02:18:14,700
Never.

2931
02:18:14,700 --> 02:18:16,100
Some areas started out here.

2932
02:18:16,200 --> 02:18:19,250
So do you wanna go back to
just let everybody know I
went back a couple of times

2933
02:18:19,251 --> 02:18:23,330
when I first started and did pretty
big shows at a different bar.

2934
02:18:23,550 --> 02:18:25,130
But I was at a bar.

2935
02:18:25,600 --> 02:18:27,290
Oh you just did like
you got your own thing.

2936
02:18:27,410 --> 02:18:27,690
Yeah.

2937
02:18:27,690 --> 02:18:28,790
Looking you fuckin stud.

2938
02:18:28,970 --> 02:18:29,250
Yeah.

2939
02:18:29,250 --> 02:18:30,410
Would you do with you bring somebody.

2940
02:18:30,800 --> 02:18:33,200
It was just me actually
just you by yourself.

2941
02:18:33,230 --> 02:18:34,330
Yeah I have.

2942
02:18:34,670 --> 02:18:35,410
You're a savage.

2943
02:18:35,410 --> 02:18:39,860
Yeah I have a big a good great
group of friends back in Youngstown.

2944
02:18:39,980 --> 02:18:41,400
How much time do you have altogether.

2945
02:18:42,440 --> 02:18:46,850
Well altogether it's weird because no
matter what I'm trying to do I always go

2946
02:18:46,851 --> 02:18:51,530
off on tangents and whatever so that's
always I have to end up doing less than

2947
02:18:51,650 --> 02:18:52,760
my goal anyway.

2948
02:18:53,150 --> 02:18:56,390
And you makes a good problem to have.

2949
02:18:56,510 --> 02:19:00,080
Yeah yeah it is that you get that
problem we do a lot of comedy.

2950
02:19:00,470 --> 02:19:03,920
Yeah I do a lot of comedy on stage yeah.

2951
02:19:03,980 --> 02:19:05,660
How many days a week are
you going up every night.

2952
02:19:05,810 --> 02:19:06,643
That's how you do it.

2953
02:19:06,890 --> 02:19:10,100
Some nights like last week I had a couple
nights where it was three shows in one

2954
02:19:10,101 --> 02:19:12,530
night flying around just doing it.

2955
02:19:12,890 --> 02:19:17,090
Isn't it amazing when you do that because
coming home comes party DNA you know

2956
02:19:17,210 --> 02:19:18,320
really gets in that groove.

2957
02:19:18,710 --> 02:19:19,450
It's hard to do.

2958
02:19:19,450 --> 02:19:20,180
Trying to do.

2959
02:19:20,180 --> 02:19:20,780
Oh yeah.

2960
02:19:20,780 --> 02:19:22,070
I find I balance.

2961
02:19:22,310 --> 02:19:23,143
I like to do that.

2962
02:19:23,510 --> 02:19:24,590
I never liked you every night.

2963
02:19:24,750 --> 02:19:26,090
I like to do like three
or four nights a week.

2964
02:19:26,480 --> 02:19:29,840
Then I like to take nights a week off
and not even think about comedy and just

2965
02:19:29,841 --> 02:19:34,070
write where I don't I don't even I
don't even entertain the idea of going

2966
02:19:34,071 --> 02:19:34,490
onstage.

2967
02:19:34,490 --> 02:19:39,380
I just go over ideas you know and I find
that there's like for me I can't just

2968
02:19:39,410 --> 02:19:40,640
always be going onstage.

2969
02:19:40,850 --> 02:19:45,500
It's like a lot of time has to be spent
especially now working on I don't know

2970
02:19:45,501 --> 02:19:48,980
like my sixth or seventh hour or something
like that and all the time I put out

2971
02:19:48,981 --> 02:19:49,814
specials and shit.

2972
02:19:50,180 --> 02:19:55,180
It's like I have to I have to figure out
like new angles and new points of view

2973
02:19:55,311 --> 02:19:56,660
and not even this whole new point of view.

2974
02:19:56,700 --> 02:20:00,680
But new subjects new new different things
that interests me new points that I

2975
02:20:00,681 --> 02:20:01,290
have.

2976
02:20:01,290 --> 02:20:03,920
I feel like I don't I don't just
get that I I just go on stage a lot.

2977
02:20:04,040 --> 02:20:08,090
I have to spend a lot of time doing other
shit you know and I think about that

2978
02:20:08,091 --> 02:20:11,300
actively now whereas when I was younger
than I really think about that actively

2979
02:20:11,600 --> 02:20:15,590
like I would just try to like right you
know I just try to come up with new bits

2980
02:20:15,980 --> 02:20:18,260
but now I make myself do things.

2981
02:20:18,560 --> 02:20:22,550
So the cool stuff will come out of
my interesting stuff to talk about.

2982
02:20:22,790 --> 02:20:26,870
It was very soon after I started standup
once and the first couple weeks I found

2983
02:20:26,871 --> 02:20:31,820
a book that Stephen King wrote called
on writing yeah great book unbelievable

2984
02:20:32,030 --> 02:20:36,200
because it's a it's obviously you know
it's not a fiction he's just talking

2985
02:20:36,201 --> 02:20:40,700
about his work ethic of writing and he's
like I don't think I'm a writer if I

2986
02:20:40,701 --> 02:20:42,950
take a day off what am I
that I'm just some guy.

2987
02:20:43,370 --> 02:20:48,370
And so I started applying that during
the day and I figured you know on top of

2988
02:20:48,411 --> 02:20:52,410
writing my own standup if I keep up this
habit of writing for a few hours every

2989
02:20:52,411 --> 02:20:53,390
day during the day

2990
02:20:54,950 --> 02:20:57,110
then then it will get better.

2991
02:20:57,260 --> 02:20:58,280
And it did.

2992
02:20:58,300 --> 02:21:01,240
Sure enough you know luckily I'm
a member of the Writers Guild now.

2993
02:21:01,710 --> 02:21:02,450
Yeah.

2994
02:21:02,450 --> 02:21:04,220
Working on the show and everything.

2995
02:21:04,460 --> 02:21:09,460
So the habit was really it was that
book that gave me the confidence because

2996
02:21:10,640 --> 02:21:11,960
you're listening to Stephen King.

2997
02:21:12,410 --> 02:21:13,270
I mean yeah.

2998
02:21:13,580 --> 02:21:14,750
One of the best at what he does.

2999
02:21:14,790 --> 02:21:16,790
So one of the best of all time.

3000
02:21:16,850 --> 02:21:17,270
Yeah yeah.

3001
02:21:17,270 --> 02:21:21,230
I mean I'm a huge fan of that guy and I
just I can't have a thing about people

3002
02:21:21,231 --> 02:21:22,064
that produce stuff.

3003
02:21:22,190 --> 02:21:27,190
Yeah I find that like for me one of
the most inspirational things is to be

3004
02:21:27,351 --> 02:21:31,190
around a lot of other inspirational
people you know like when I like when I go

3005
02:21:31,191 --> 02:21:34,820
to a UFC I want to work out and after
I come home I want to fucking work out

3006
02:21:34,821 --> 02:21:36,200
like crazy when I go see comedy.

3007
02:21:36,230 --> 02:21:38,870
I want to write and I think
that's what's really important.

3008
02:21:39,050 --> 02:21:39,800
Oh totally.

3009
02:21:39,800 --> 02:21:42,470
I do that all the time even
with the music that I listen to.

3010
02:21:43,550 --> 02:21:46,640
Going somewhere getting ready
for something you know at night.

3011
02:21:46,840 --> 02:21:51,840
I listen a big powerful music that'll get
me you know sort of hyped and inspired

3012
02:21:52,940 --> 02:21:56,540
a lot of live shows is that type of
music that I listen to and you hear the

3013
02:21:56,541 --> 02:21:57,890
crowd just yeah.

3014
02:21:58,440 --> 02:21:58,960
Yeah.

3015
02:21:58,960 --> 02:22:02,840
In these breaks or at the beginnings or
at the end of the song and that's the

3016
02:22:02,841 --> 02:22:07,040
stuff that takes every little bit of
Mojo one can absorb to be able to kick it

3017
02:22:07,041 --> 02:22:07,874
back out.

3018
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,730
Yeah that's why I really
like music as well.

3019
02:22:10,910 --> 02:22:14,600
I think music is one of the cool things
to see because it's like the energy is

3020
02:22:14,601 --> 02:22:17,030
putting it but it's totally
different from comedy.

3021
02:22:17,300 --> 02:22:20,690
It's like some new facet of
some new energy some new thing.

3022
02:22:20,930 --> 02:22:25,220
And like when I listen to a song like
some songs or suck something about it like

3023
02:22:25,460 --> 02:22:29,780
like there's a lyrical quality to like
writing in songs that I started to

3024
02:22:29,781 --> 02:22:32,630
realize somewhere along the line
is applicable to comedy as well.

3025
02:22:32,900 --> 02:22:37,900
Like when a good joke is written
correctly and a joke has a good economy of

3026
02:22:38,481 --> 02:22:43,481
words and the right words to describe
the right situations it has like a

3027
02:22:43,581 --> 02:22:45,200
rhythmic quality to it.

3028
02:22:45,530 --> 02:22:50,530
And I think that's sort of that's sort
of underestimated or overlooked by a lot

3029
02:22:50,811 --> 02:22:51,500
of comedians.

3030
02:22:51,500 --> 02:22:56,480
The impact that that sort of rhythm to
the delivery has the impact of it I think

3031
02:22:56,481 --> 02:22:57,330
is pretty substantial.

3032
02:22:57,520 --> 02:22:58,250
Oh totally.

3033
02:22:58,250 --> 02:23:01,520
But we don't think about that we just
think about what is funny but it's not

3034
02:23:01,521 --> 02:23:06,521
just that it's like it's funny and it's
also good and it's smooth and it's a lot

3035
02:23:06,651 --> 02:23:10,160
of things to it to make it more
enjoyable more interesting to listen to.

3036
02:23:10,190 --> 02:23:13,220
A perfect example of what you're talking
about right now with the rhythm and

3037
02:23:13,221 --> 02:23:14,720
like timing and everything.

3038
02:23:14,870 --> 02:23:18,920
Last night I'm hosting at the Comedy
Store it's like 40 comedians everybody

3039
02:23:18,921 --> 02:23:22,640
that's new and employees after that and
then paid regular whatever and in the

3040
02:23:22,641 --> 02:23:27,620
middle of it a cook that the Mexican
guy Aldo don't show who works the deep

3041
02:23:27,621 --> 02:23:28,700
fryer at the Comedy Store.

3042
02:23:28,940 --> 02:23:32,480
Hey man I want to go on stage
and barely speaks English at all.

3043
02:23:32,500 --> 02:23:37,500
I mean the impression I just did is making
him sound much more American than he

3044
02:23:37,641 --> 02:23:38,450
is.

3045
02:23:38,450 --> 02:23:41,080
And he he wants to do comedy
and I go you know what man.

3046
02:23:41,180 --> 02:23:41,600
All right.

3047
02:23:41,600 --> 02:23:43,230
But it's just gonna be two minutes okay.

3048
02:23:43,550 --> 02:23:46,220
This way in case it's you
know do whatever is right.

3049
02:23:46,820 --> 02:23:48,950
But you know and he goes up.

3050
02:23:49,280 --> 02:23:53,330
But it was hilarious because nobody
could understand a single word but he was

3051
02:23:53,331 --> 02:23:56,780
completely committed and then all of a
sudden he's making this noise and you

3052
02:23:56,781 --> 02:24:00,800
really you don't you don't know even
know what the noise he was making was but

3053
02:24:00,830 --> 02:24:05,830
his commitment and his beats with it
just he crushed he crushed and all these

3054
02:24:07,160 --> 02:24:11,060
other comedians that do it every night
and look at going up in that room at the

3055
02:24:11,061 --> 02:24:12,800
Comedy Store is like this is it.

3056
02:24:12,830 --> 02:24:15,710
I'm going to show them what I would
do on The Tonight Show if I was on it

3057
02:24:15,711 --> 02:24:16,400
tonight.

3058
02:24:16,400 --> 02:24:20,270
Then you have the guy work in the frying
pans who nobody understands a word.

3059
02:24:20,420 --> 02:24:23,720
There's people that spend so much time
writing and everything but there he is.

3060
02:24:23,810 --> 02:24:27,830
And it sure it's a silly instance
but it was extremely funny.

3061
02:24:27,950 --> 02:24:32,950
If I'm cracking up and the audience is
laughing and people are then it's funny.

3062
02:24:34,130 --> 02:24:35,990
And but you know it's really
and he did it without a word.

3063
02:24:36,080 --> 02:24:38,990
How do you how do you recreate that
could you recreate that with another

3064
02:24:38,991 --> 02:24:39,410
audience.

3065
02:24:39,410 --> 02:24:40,100
Maybe not.

3066
02:24:40,100 --> 02:24:44,450
And make maybe that would only work in
that sort of a really lose situation

3067
02:24:44,451 --> 02:24:45,440
where it's a comedy store.

3068
02:24:45,480 --> 02:24:47,030
Bunch comedians in the crowd right.

3069
02:24:47,180 --> 02:24:50,280
You want to go up you go up
and like no expectations right.

3070
02:24:50,370 --> 02:24:53,460
You know I mean it's like Could you
recreate that and become a comedian.

3071
02:24:53,540 --> 02:24:54,090
Right.

3072
02:24:54,090 --> 02:24:58,460
It was yeah because you know how that
that's a weird realization you have where

3073
02:24:58,520 --> 02:25:03,050
just because a joke kills in one place
it could bomb another place of total and

3074
02:25:03,051 --> 02:25:04,340
you say it the exact same way.

3075
02:25:04,440 --> 02:25:06,000
Yeah well what the fuck yeah.

3076
02:25:06,110 --> 02:25:09,480
And then you realize well well there isn't
like this isn't always work like this

3077
02:25:09,481 --> 02:25:13,160
this weird idea I'm throwing out there
yeah some people are gonna buy into it

3078
02:25:13,161 --> 02:25:14,090
and some people are not.

3079
02:25:14,570 --> 02:25:16,640
And sometimes it sounds like
the greatest joke ever written.

3080
02:25:16,960 --> 02:25:18,350
Sometimes it sounds like you're a fool.

3081
02:25:18,440 --> 02:25:21,920
Yeah because sometimes there's something
that happened the first time you did it

3082
02:25:21,921 --> 02:25:25,310
when it worked that you did before that
you don't normally do that you forgot

3083
02:25:25,311 --> 02:25:27,170
that you did and it
worked because of that.

3084
02:25:27,710 --> 02:25:31,220
And I think a good thing for young
comics to realize is that that's good.

3085
02:25:32,050 --> 02:25:32,670
It's good.

3086
02:25:32,670 --> 02:25:35,640
All those bombing and failing
and not getting it right.

3087
02:25:35,660 --> 02:25:36,230
It's good.

3088
02:25:36,230 --> 02:25:37,040
Oh yeah totally.

3089
02:25:37,040 --> 02:25:39,960
Because if you don't have it you're not
going to appreciate when it goes well.

3090
02:25:40,100 --> 02:25:44,300
I remember in my first few weeks of doing
it somebody went to a comedian came up

3091
02:25:44,301 --> 02:25:47,630
to me who I won't say his
name but he was terrible.

3092
02:25:47,750 --> 02:25:52,750
And he goes Hey man you know the
trick is bomb as often as you can.

3093
02:25:53,930 --> 02:25:57,740
I'm thinking myself Oh yeah that's what
you would do you'll lose there if that's

3094
02:25:57,741 --> 02:25:58,700
what you're doing anyway.

3095
02:25:59,180 --> 02:26:01,190
But mostly I got Americans to bomb.

3096
02:26:01,430 --> 02:26:02,840
What was his rationale.

3097
02:26:02,900 --> 02:26:05,840
Well he goes you know because now's
the time to knock bombing out.

3098
02:26:06,140 --> 02:26:07,580
Oh you know how to bomb now.

3099
02:26:08,280 --> 02:26:11,060
It ended up making some
sense Labor's terrible.

3100
02:26:11,120 --> 02:26:12,140
So how did you have such wisdom.

3101
02:26:12,230 --> 02:26:13,190
Right exactly.

3102
02:26:13,850 --> 02:26:14,660
Somebody must have.

3103
02:26:14,660 --> 02:26:17,390
Somebody must have told him that like
hey you know look at it this way in a

3104
02:26:17,391 --> 02:26:19,270
positive sense you're bombings.

3105
02:26:19,310 --> 02:26:20,143
Good.

3106
02:26:21,110 --> 02:26:23,900
I don't think back means
funny anymore makes me sad.

3107
02:26:24,140 --> 02:26:25,070
It's funny to you right now.

3108
02:26:25,320 --> 02:26:26,330
So close yeah.

3109
02:26:26,600 --> 02:26:28,310
Now just madness.

3110
02:26:28,520 --> 02:26:33,020
I look at it I just see madness this
people that you know that are going to try

3111
02:26:33,260 --> 02:26:37,310
for years and years and years and know
it's never gonna happen right doesn't

3112
02:26:37,311 --> 02:26:38,144
exist for them.

3113
02:26:39,340 --> 02:26:40,173
Yeah

3114
02:26:41,110 --> 02:26:45,460
it is creepy and I've seen it with
a few people but you with anything.

3115
02:26:45,490 --> 02:26:48,100
I mean you watch American Idol and people
saying and you like how is this person

3116
02:26:48,101 --> 02:26:49,330
think they've been saying they're crazy.

3117
02:26:49,780 --> 02:26:52,840
How does this person think anything what
anybody wants it must be that for if

3118
02:26:52,841 --> 02:26:54,190
you're a literary agent.

3119
02:26:54,760 --> 02:26:58,180
I mean imagine how many people send you
secret stories like Holy fuck are you

3120
02:26:58,181 --> 02:27:00,240
reading this nuts fucking work.

3121
02:27:00,610 --> 02:27:01,443
Read this.

3122
02:27:01,960 --> 02:27:03,840
What what is that.

3123
02:27:03,860 --> 02:27:06,110
Tony why why are some people
so goddamn delusional.

3124
02:27:06,340 --> 02:27:10,250
Is there a broad spectrum of human beings
and the amount of voltage your battery

3125
02:27:10,251 --> 02:27:12,950
puts out and some people are
just designed to dig holes.

3126
02:27:13,190 --> 02:27:18,190
I think that the delusion is you know the
delusion needs to be that with tons of

3127
02:27:21,201 --> 02:27:23,570
work at something you can accomplish it.

3128
02:27:24,410 --> 02:27:26,900
Not that the delusion is I can do this.

3129
02:27:27,350 --> 02:27:31,250
It's you've got to everybody that has
ever been good at anything worked at it

3130
02:27:31,280 --> 02:27:32,480
you know and I mean a lot.

3131
02:27:32,840 --> 02:27:34,790
So it's not and they wanted it.

3132
02:27:34,920 --> 02:27:36,710
And even if you work out it
doesn't mean you gonna get it.

3133
02:27:37,100 --> 02:27:41,450
Especially with things like talent
things like talent is a weird thing.

3134
02:27:41,720 --> 02:27:46,280
Like these guys I've seen guys that
like they train striking like for MDMA.

3135
02:27:46,340 --> 02:27:47,930
They train it for years.

3136
02:27:48,020 --> 02:27:49,550
They fucking trained for years.

3137
02:27:49,910 --> 02:27:52,100
But then when it comes and actually
fight they can't pull it off.

3138
02:27:52,460 --> 02:27:54,170
They just they can't
strike with people again.

3139
02:27:54,410 --> 02:27:55,280
They don't move right.

3140
02:27:55,310 --> 02:27:58,340
They're too slow for whatever reason
it is they can never figure it out.

3141
02:27:58,600 --> 02:28:01,790
And there's other guys who
show em a couple of moves
they lose like fucking pros

3142
02:28:01,820 --> 02:28:04,400
like instantly and they crush you
and knock you out with one punch.

3143
02:28:04,660 --> 02:28:05,540
It doesn't make any sense.

3144
02:28:05,900 --> 02:28:06,590
It's like either.

3145
02:28:06,590 --> 02:28:08,930
I mean it's like that guy
clearly has a gift right.

3146
02:28:09,080 --> 02:28:11,470
This guy clearly no matter how hard he
works he's never going to get there.

3147
02:28:11,840 --> 02:28:12,673
It's true.

3148
02:28:13,170 --> 02:28:17,870
The weird thing about this life boy must
be a real curse led to a crazy feeling

3149
02:28:17,871 --> 02:28:18,890
to be one of those guys.

3150
02:28:18,920 --> 02:28:21,800
It's like trying to pursue something
and you having no success and you can't

3151
02:28:22,130 --> 02:28:24,500
connect the dots and
you can't move forward.

3152
02:28:25,050 --> 02:28:30,050
Man it's you know before anything was
happening you know before when I was still

3153
02:28:30,771 --> 02:28:34,190
not making money and before I was getting
past at the clubs and Hollywood and

3154
02:28:34,191 --> 02:28:37,010
everything it was extremely low.

3155
02:28:37,260 --> 02:28:41,090
You know I was able to keep having
fun by surrounding myself around funny

3156
02:28:41,091 --> 02:28:43,790
friends and everything
but man was it hard.

3157
02:28:44,330 --> 02:28:47,930
Yeah it's depressing Yeah pressing as
fuck when you're not making it deck out

3158
02:28:47,931 --> 02:28:48,650
there.

3159
02:28:48,650 --> 02:28:51,350
It's hard but isn't it like
a real character builder.

3160
02:28:51,410 --> 02:28:52,560
Once you're through to the other side.

3161
02:28:52,580 --> 02:28:54,500
Like oh yeah he must
be so happy right now.

3162
02:28:54,680 --> 02:28:55,180
Oh yeah.

3163
02:28:55,180 --> 02:28:56,330
Yeah you're always smiling and shit.

3164
02:28:56,450 --> 02:28:58,220
I'll totally you're like
a professional comedian.

3165
02:28:58,490 --> 02:28:59,480
Boom got through.

3166
02:28:59,750 --> 02:29:00,380
It's wild.

3167
02:29:00,380 --> 02:29:01,100
You made it.

3168
02:29:01,100 --> 02:29:03,760
Yeah dude you you know you
fucking killed in Indianapolis.

3169
02:29:03,800 --> 02:29:07,370
There's a lot of goddamn people's 2000
people out there and you had to go up

3170
02:29:07,371 --> 02:29:08,860
cold and we knew who the fuck you were.

3171
02:29:08,930 --> 02:29:09,560
I love it.

3172
02:29:09,560 --> 02:29:09,920
Kill.

3173
02:29:09,920 --> 02:29:10,520
That's right.

3174
02:29:10,520 --> 02:29:11,540
That's the way I like it.

3175
02:29:11,680 --> 02:29:11,840
Yeah.

3176
02:29:11,840 --> 02:29:12,673
The audience loved you.

3177
02:29:12,830 --> 02:29:13,663
I love love.

3178
02:29:13,670 --> 02:29:14,540
A lot of positive tweets.

3179
02:29:14,580 --> 02:29:15,840
Man I thought you're funny.

3180
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:17,300
Yeah it was a blast.

3181
02:29:17,390 --> 02:29:21,260
I listened to the set the next day
and I just couldn't even believe it.

3182
02:29:21,390 --> 02:29:23,390
This was really wild.

3183
02:29:23,480 --> 02:29:27,410
So we caught all those in the sound
and the power of that one was that the

3184
02:29:27,411 --> 02:29:28,280
biggest crowd you ever worked.

3185
02:29:29,570 --> 02:29:31,280
I think so right or right around there.

3186
02:29:31,370 --> 02:29:36,110
I should know but it's it's been right
around there with a couple of shows the

3187
02:29:36,111 --> 02:29:37,890
quote that was sorry about
this guy Phil Elmore.

3188
02:29:37,920 --> 02:29:38,600
He's a writer.

3189
02:29:38,600 --> 02:29:40,070
He wrote this on his Twitter.

3190
02:29:40,180 --> 02:29:43,880
So as a writer never has a vacation for
a writer life consists of either writing

3191
02:29:43,881 --> 02:29:44,870
or thinking about writing.

3192
02:29:45,560 --> 02:29:48,240
And that's Eugene you know sick go.

3193
02:29:48,770 --> 02:29:49,603
He was a playwright.

3194
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:50,970
That's so true.

3195
02:29:51,100 --> 02:29:51,933
Psycho.

3196
02:29:52,040 --> 02:29:54,590
I can't sleep at night if I
didn't do something that day.

3197
02:29:54,740 --> 02:29:56,150
It's not a vacation.

3198
02:29:57,090 --> 02:29:57,923
I'm.

3199
02:29:57,980 --> 02:29:59,330
I work my vacation.

3200
02:29:59,560 --> 02:30:01,250
I think this is a blast.

3201
02:30:01,370 --> 02:30:06,370
I would be uncomfortable
for me is literally being
on an island for a week with

3202
02:30:07,911 --> 02:30:09,590
no internet and no.

3203
02:30:09,980 --> 02:30:10,340
Yeah.

3204
02:30:10,340 --> 02:30:11,180
Pen and paper.

3205
02:30:11,330 --> 02:30:14,110
Well people that don't stand
that like you need to relax Tony.

3206
02:30:14,250 --> 02:30:17,840
You need to stop working so hard they
understand that you're the only person

3207
02:30:17,841 --> 02:30:19,610
that can make Tony
Hinchcliffe jokes right.

3208
02:30:19,880 --> 02:30:22,940
If somebody likes you you're the
only person that that makes you.

3209
02:30:23,250 --> 02:30:25,730
You're the only person that performs
in your view you know that's it.

3210
02:30:25,940 --> 02:30:27,500
That's the only Tony Tony him Thomas.

3211
02:30:28,460 --> 02:30:32,210
Tony Hinchcliffe show around no one else
can do it unless they're in Vegas years

3212
02:30:32,211 --> 02:30:33,740
from now doing an impersonator act.

3213
02:30:33,830 --> 02:30:34,470
Right.

3214
02:30:34,470 --> 02:30:39,470
Right history is the autobiography of a
madman Alexander Herman son of bad ass

3215
02:30:40,760 --> 02:30:41,070
quote.

3216
02:30:41,070 --> 02:30:44,320
I read today might be
good wit in this show.

3217
02:30:46,960 --> 02:30:49,330
