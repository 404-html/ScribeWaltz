1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,650
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:01,801
No,

3
00:00:01,801 --> 00:00:02,730
he's not being mean.

4
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:04,140
I stopped doing racial jokes,

5
00:00:04,141 --> 00:00:06,630
like being heavy on racial
jokes just cause I was like,

6
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:07,920
I don't fucking know.

7
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:08,460
I don't,

8
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,180
I don't care.

9
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:14,180
Like I don't give a shit enough about
equality to put my job on the line to try

10
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:16,170
to make everyone even like I'll,

11
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,790
I'll get into nights if
it's an all black room.

12
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:19,830
I just do black jokes but not mean,

13
00:00:19,831 --> 00:00:20,641
but just what I do.

14
00:00:20,641 --> 00:00:21,474
Black jokes.

15
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,433
But um,

16
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:23,281
and then you do that.

17
00:00:23,281 --> 00:00:23,761
Once you do that,

18
00:00:23,761 --> 00:00:26,670
you have a fucking power
of attorney to do anything.

19
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,560
Cause even the clean
people go my kid's finger,

20
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:31,230
they're asked to write right now and then,

21
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,093
and then,

22
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,460
and then I talked to the audience a
little when you were saying that you,

23
00:00:35,461 --> 00:00:35,790
um,

24
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,810
you used to do a real racist
jokes or racial jokes,

25
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,673
racial jokes,

26
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:41,260
you know,

27
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,340
w you and you stopped doing them
because they offended too many people.

28
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:44,530
No,

29
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:45,020
I never gotten,

30
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,410
no one ever got offended,

31
00:00:46,411 --> 00:00:48,510
but I just noticed that I was up for one.

32
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:49,410
I was obsessing on it.

33
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,040
I can,

34
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,940
I would write,

35
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:52,680
I could write all day long.

36
00:00:52,681 --> 00:00:53,940
I could write jokes about black people.

37
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:55,501
I mean,

38
00:00:55,501 --> 00:00:56,220
if you've sent me,

39
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,180
I swear to God,

40
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,100
if you put me in a room
with a black audience,

41
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,760
all I'll do is talk about
black people all I'll do.

42
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,050
And like now the dirt,

43
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,450
the one only the furthest I
go is I have a joke about,

44
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,313
um,

45
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,160
just,

46
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:08,371
uh,

47
00:01:08,371 --> 00:01:08,760
I go,

48
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,220
I think is racist that they
don't make black baby powder.

49
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:11,971
Like,

50
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:14,340
I just think that from a company
named Johnson and Johnson,

51
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:15,390
they would have thought of that by now.

52
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:16,861
And then they go,

53
00:01:16,861 --> 00:01:17,420
you know that,

54
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:17,820
uh,

55
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:18,800
that's home and make $1 million.

56
00:01:18,801 --> 00:01:19,980
I'm gonna make by baby powder.

57
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:20,911
And then,

58
00:01:20,911 --> 00:01:21,560
uh,

59
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,393
and then,

60
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,660
and then I'll call it magic
Johnson and Johnson's.

61
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,340
So then one night there's one,

62
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:26,851
this is great.

63
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:27,880
One night this black dude's,

64
00:01:27,881 --> 00:01:29,220
it's of an audience in Miami.

65
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:30,054
He goes,

66
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,350
hey motherfucker,

67
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,191
when you get done,

68
00:01:32,191 --> 00:01:33,960
you did a joke about black baby powder.

69
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:35,460
I'll tell you I don't make shit.

70
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,593
And so I was like,

71
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,100
I'm think I'm done with a joke now.

72
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,060
Like with,

73
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,530
why don't they make it?

74
00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:41,364
And he goes,

75
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,210
we don't have a problem with
moisture the way you guys do it goes.

76
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,930
Every time I hung a white guy,

77
00:01:46,931 --> 00:01:48,210
it's like hugging a dolphin.

78
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,080
He goes,

79
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,330
black people have a
problem retaining moisture.

80
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:56,580
So they have a problems getting ashy
so they have to always stay moist.

81
00:01:56,581 --> 00:01:58,920
Whereas white people are
constantly fucking moist.

82
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,933
Whoa.

83
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:00,601
And so he's like,

84
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:03,840
they just never needed black baby
powder like people don't use.

85
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:04,741
And I was like,

86
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:05,760
but it was awesome.

87
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,080
It was like a great moment.

88
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,340
I love dude,

89
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:09,174
if I could,

90
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,100
if I had a video tape of every
experience that I'm a black to in London

91
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,900
audience,

92
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,360
I would be the most
famous comic in the world.

93
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,350
The,

94
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,570
I've had black dudes
get on stage in Miami,

95
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,290
right?

96
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,123
Real Shit.

97
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,470
Fucking three gangsters in the front row.

98
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,131
True Story.

99
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:25,290
All my children fucking,

100
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:26,610
they're ruining the show for everyone.

101
00:02:26,611 --> 00:02:28,350
And I go up and I just
talked to them one day.

102
00:02:28,351 --> 00:02:31,050
He gets up on stage half a
through my set and he's like,

103
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,580
this is a real motherfucker.

104
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,451
He's keeping it real,

105
00:02:33,451 --> 00:02:34,410
real talk right now.

106
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,160
Real talk,

107
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:35,440
you know,

108
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,280
real motherfuckers getting at three Oh
five and he drops his pants and shows his

109
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:39,930
Dick Place goes bananas,

110
00:02:39,931 --> 00:02:40,201
right?

111
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:40,550
They're like,

112
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:40,861
whoa.

113
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:42,900
And it's a the biggest blackest.

114
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:43,950
It's almost purple.

115
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:44,910
It's so black like,

116
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:45,930
but as jack huge,

117
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,130
it's huge.

118
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:47,970
And I'm like,

119
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:48,930
that isn't real.

120
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,850
That is bugging real
bugging month nine inches.

121
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,551
And it's a,

122
00:02:53,551 --> 00:02:53,881
it's a,

123
00:02:53,881 --> 00:02:54,840
it's a shower.

124
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,890
It's like a thick,

125
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,473
thick,

126
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,340
thick and uncircumcised.

127
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,340
Just looking at it like,

128
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,210
Holy Shit.

129
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,230
So then I go,

130
00:03:02,231 --> 00:03:02,471
I go,

131
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:02,890
man,

132
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:03,723
that's fucking,

133
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,780
his name was ray.

134
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:05,980
I don't know why I remember that.

135
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:06,311
But I'm like,

136
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:06,970
Ray,

137
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:07,181
I go,

138
00:03:07,181 --> 00:03:11,020
I think you might want to get off stage
because I can guarantee you they're

139
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,990
calling the cops right now and I don't
want you to go to jail for just showing

140
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:14,620
your Dick.

141
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,280
He's like,

142
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,031
I appreciate that.

143
00:03:16,031 --> 00:03:16,691
Good looking out.

144
00:03:16,691 --> 00:03:18,490
And then he puts his pants on and leave.

145
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,383
So then I go,

146
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:19,721
man,

147
00:03:19,721 --> 00:03:20,554
how do you follow that?

148
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,090
Another gang banger stands up,

149
00:03:22,091 --> 00:03:22,631
gets on stage.

150
00:03:22,631 --> 00:03:22,841
I go,

151
00:03:22,841 --> 00:03:23,321
please tell me.

152
00:03:23,321 --> 00:03:24,340
We're seeing another cock right now.

153
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,440
Pulls his pants down,

154
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,520
bugging justice.

155
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,420
Big But lighter,

156
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:28,780
lighter,

157
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,800
like a lighter brown.

158
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,461
And I'm like,

159
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:31,360
Holy Shit.

160
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:32,110
I'm like,

161
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:32,531
and I was like,

162
00:03:32,531 --> 00:03:33,830
you might want to go catch up with breaks.

163
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,380
I can't guarantee you
they're calling the cops now.

164
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,490
So they're sitting with,

165
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:37,030
I swear to you,

166
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,750
all my children,

167
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,930
they're sitting with an heroin,

168
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,210
a hairless albino.

169
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,050
Okay.

170
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:41,883
And I said,

171
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:44,800
and now and now that the crowd is
like fucking in a fevered pitch.

172
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:45,160
I go,

173
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:45,910
that's funny.

174
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,750
Out of all the Dicks,

175
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:47,980
I wanted to see what was yours.

176
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,260
He stands up,

177
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,380
gets on stage,

178
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,130
takes his dick out and it
looks like a light house.

179
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,160
There's no grass,

180
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:55,210
right?

181
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,410
White and the Po,

182
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,810
they're flipping over fucking tables now.

183
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,340
Like fucking going nuts.

184
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:00,881
And I was like,

185
00:04:00,881 --> 00:04:01,511
Ladies and gentlemen,

186
00:04:01,511 --> 00:04:02,344
that's my show.

187
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:03,723
That's it.

188
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:08,810
Oh,

189
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,070
I literally followed that.

190
00:04:10,071 --> 00:04:10,850
You can't follow that.

191
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:11,440
Can't follow it.

192
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,440
I literally,

193
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:15,080
and I've white glow in the
dark Casper that goes Dick.

194
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:15,710
Oh was,

195
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,120
it was beautiful and it was big.

196
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,140
It was big.

197
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:18,761
I swear to you.

198
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:19,251
It was big.

199
00:04:19,251 --> 00:04:20,084
And I was like,

200
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:20,751
oh,

201
00:04:20,751 --> 00:04:24,110
I was like fucking and then and then
they all waited for me out at the bar and

202
00:04:24,111 --> 00:04:24,680
they were like,

203
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:24,921
dude,

204
00:04:24,921 --> 00:04:25,760
we're taking you out.

205
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,623
And I was like,

206
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:28,640
this doesn't end this way.

207
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,010
I love it when he bombs

208
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:33,570
so rare.

209
00:04:33,571 --> 00:04:34,940
He's really fucking funny man.

210
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:38,090
It's like when it's like when you
shoot a bear with a bow and Arrow,

211
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,620
but they don't know
they've been injured yet,

212
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,110
but they know there has to
be shot with a bow and arrow.

213
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,100
I watched a lot of hunting.

214
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,860
I watched a lot of hunting
videos like I used to.

215
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:46,370
I used to,

216
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:46,731
if I,

217
00:04:46,731 --> 00:04:48,530
if I ever got too fucked up within,

218
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,281
I'd watch hunting.

219
00:04:49,281 --> 00:04:49,821
In Florida,

220
00:04:49,821 --> 00:04:52,730
it's very easy to get really
bear bear hunting from,

221
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,380
in my opinion,

222
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:53,841
you've done it.

223
00:04:53,841 --> 00:04:54,291
I've never done it,

224
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,520
but all the videos are,

225
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:59,480
they like put a box out full of food and
then they'd sit in a tent and then the

226
00:04:59,481 --> 00:05:02,090
bear would come out and they shoot it
with a bow and Arrow and the bear would

227
00:05:02,091 --> 00:05:02,924
get hit.

228
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,830
But it would almost feel,

229
00:05:03,831 --> 00:05:05,000
it would seem like the bear be like,

230
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:05,181
ow,

231
00:05:05,181 --> 00:05:06,014
what the fuck was that?

232
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,660
And then you'd see the look in the
bear's face where they'd be like,

233
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,010
I don't feel good.

234
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,360
I'm going to go rest for a little bit.

235
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,440
That's how Supergirl girl looks.

236
00:05:12,441 --> 00:05:13,274
When he bombs.

237
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,503
It's like,

238
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:14,901
it's like,

239
00:05:14,901 --> 00:05:15,500
he's like,

240
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:15,771
he like,

241
00:05:15,771 --> 00:05:16,700
he looks at you like,

242
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:17,460
did I get,

243
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,293
I get hit?

244
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:18,801
And you're like,

245
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:19,131
and you're,

246
00:05:19,131 --> 00:05:19,641
and you know,

247
00:05:19,641 --> 00:05:20,510
he's been hit by an arrow.

248
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,010
My favorite one was in,

249
00:05:22,011 --> 00:05:22,370
uh,

250
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:22,730
in,

251
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:23,031
in,

252
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:23,360
uh,

253
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,320
in Pearl Harbor.

254
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:25,220
Me,

255
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:25,671
Pearl Harbor,

256
00:05:25,671 --> 00:05:26,240
Hawaii,

257
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,840
me,

258
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,030
Tom Segura and Russell Peters.

259
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:29,961
And,

260
00:05:29,961 --> 00:05:30,200
uh,

261
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,580
I go up and I do okay,

262
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,230
but maybe I was dirtier
than I should've been,

263
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,310
but it's totally fine.

264
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,510
Cause the only rule thing,

265
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,330
we're don't make fun of the Hawaiians.

266
00:05:38,331 --> 00:05:38,631
That was,

267
00:05:38,631 --> 00:05:40,040
it don't make fun of the Hawaiians.

268
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,750
And don't bring up Pearl Harbor.

269
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,190
What?

270
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,540
Tom's opening joke.

271
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:44,901
He's like,

272
00:05:44,901 --> 00:05:45,620
man,

273
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,820
it's a lot of fat people.

274
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,261
He's like,

275
00:05:48,261 --> 00:05:50,040
I heard island life was slope.

276
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,860
I didn't know they were
talking about their metabolism.

277
00:05:51,861 --> 00:05:54,650
So then he says I got lost walking around.

278
00:05:54,651 --> 00:05:57,020
Luckily a Japanese guy
pointed out the directions.

279
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:57,891
Those Japanese?

280
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:58,011
No,

281
00:05:58,011 --> 00:05:59,540
this place like the back of their hand.

282
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:04,460
I mean he bumps so hard that
when he got off he was like debt,

283
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,800
early sweats and he's like,

284
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:07,300
he's like,

285
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,310
who are pretty good and you might
want to go back to your nest and raw.

286
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,890
You know Tom's going to lose he shit.

287
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,480
That video of where I'm shaving Tom.

288
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,593
That's that week?

289
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,713
Yeah.

290
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,320
For after the show.

291
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,540
Before how many shows did you guys do?

292
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,260
One?

293
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,230
Just one in one.

294
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,121
I went up,

295
00:06:23,121 --> 00:06:23,931
I was a little dirty.

296
00:06:23,931 --> 00:06:25,190
I think Tom went up,

297
00:06:25,191 --> 00:06:26,024
had a rough set.

298
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,410
He kind of want them back.

299
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,190
We know Tom is not right for
corporate gig in that opinion.

300
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,050
And there's a corporate game gives the,

301
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:33,380
for the,

302
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:38,240
it was like maybe I want to say 3000
people on at Pearl Harbor sitting in lawn

303
00:06:38,241 --> 00:06:39,290
chairs with their families.

304
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,340
What was the Gig like?

305
00:06:40,341 --> 00:06:40,551
What,

306
00:06:40,551 --> 00:06:41,360
who is it for?

307
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:41,991
For the Pearl.

308
00:06:41,991 --> 00:06:42,824
For the USO.

309
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,130
Ah,

310
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:44,780
that's on,

311
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,690
that's a military guy.

312
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:46,100
Yes.

313
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,780
Corporate kid will be that same.

314
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:48,800
Same Energy.

315
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:49,941
So I,

316
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:51,470
and so then Tom sits next to me.

317
00:06:51,471 --> 00:06:52,550
This is my favorite part.

318
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,720
Thompson texted me and Russell Peters
comes on stage and you can hear there's a

319
00:06:56,721 --> 00:06:57,800
murmuring now mind you,

320
00:06:57,801 --> 00:07:01,910
we're at war with Iraq and Russell
Peters is a little brown for their taste.

321
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,530
And Tom Goes,

322
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,870
I never realized he looks like the enemy.

323
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,290
And Russell Peters is by the way,

324
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,230
didn't acknowledge it did had a great set,

325
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:16,910
but you could hear that kind of like they
brought up one of the like and Tom and

326
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:17,370
I were in the back.

327
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,260
Like this is bad.

328
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,293
We the next day.

329
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:19,690
Yeah.

330
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:20,260
Yeah.

331
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,310
He thought it was bad
because he was brown.

332
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,990
It was only because we had gone to rifle
training the day before and Russell had

333
00:07:26,991 --> 00:07:29,300
randomly chose not to go randomly.

334
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,550
And the first words
that rifle training was,

335
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,720
there's one rule here.

336
00:07:32,721 --> 00:07:33,410
If it's Brown,

337
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:33,921
it moves.

338
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:34,754
You kill it.

339
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:35,893
And,

340
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,771
and Tom was like,

341
00:07:36,771 --> 00:07:37,240
thanks guys,

342
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,140
you didn't bring Russell,

343
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,291
let the fuck.

344
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:42,200
Imagine if you're Mexican and you're in
the fucking army and they tell you that

345
00:07:42,201 --> 00:07:42,740
shit.

346
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,450
If it's brown and it moves,

347
00:07:44,451 --> 00:07:45,284
we kill it.

348
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,041
Whoa.

349
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:46,860
That guy.

350
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,170
And we brought our wives to it.

351
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:48,560
We,

352
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,700
we've bought arrives to rifle,

353
00:07:49,701 --> 00:07:50,990
we shot every gun they had.

354
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,630
We brought our wives
and the girls were like,

355
00:07:53,631 --> 00:07:54,231
right before we went,

356
00:07:54,231 --> 00:07:54,831
stepped in and they go,

357
00:07:54,831 --> 00:07:55,760
can we go to the bathroom?

358
00:07:55,761 --> 00:07:56,001
Or like,

359
00:07:56,001 --> 00:07:56,121
yeah,

360
00:07:56,121 --> 00:07:56,954
go to the bathroom.

361
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,390
So we walk in and the guy's like,

362
00:07:59,391 --> 00:07:59,990
uh,

363
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,250
I thought they were going to be six.

364
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,440
He's like a real military guy.

365
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:03,980
And we're like,

366
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,161
yeah,

367
00:08:04,161 --> 00:08:04,971
the girls went to the bathroom.

368
00:08:04,971 --> 00:08:05,804
He was okay.

369
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:06,411
And then Tom goes,

370
00:08:06,411 --> 00:08:06,591
hey,

371
00:08:06,591 --> 00:08:07,424
do me a favor.

372
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,323
When they get in,

373
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,650
act a little like aggressive to them
and misogynistic and let's just see,

374
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,640
looks on their faces.

375
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,080
So the girls walk in and he was on,

376
00:08:15,081 --> 00:08:15,500
well,

377
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,120
typical lady's got lost.

378
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,500
Don't know what time it is.

379
00:08:18,501 --> 00:08:19,790
If their man's not next to him.

380
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:23,380
And Christina and my wife
started bubbling like what the,

381
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,110
and he's like,

382
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:26,690
ladies do follow the men
don't know what to do.

383
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,613
Thank you gentlemen.

384
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:31,250
And he got into character
so good that Tom stepped in.

385
00:08:31,251 --> 00:08:31,550
He's like,

386
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,001
it's a joke.

387
00:08:32,001 --> 00:08:32,990
Everybody hits a joke.

388
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:34,880
He's doing it because we asked him to.

389
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,160
This guy was good.

390
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:37,640
Wow.

391
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,360
That's funny.

392
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,193
Yeah.

393
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,330
That's hilarious.

394
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:41,760
Yeah.

395
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,600
It's funny that you can get a
trained killer to just crack jokes.

396
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:44,961
Oh,

397
00:08:44,961 --> 00:08:45,470
that guy was,

398
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,070
it was,

399
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,090
it was a really fun trip.

400
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,781
If it's Brown,

401
00:08:47,781 --> 00:08:48,170
kill it.

402
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:48,960
If it's Brown,

403
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,090
it moves you kill it.

404
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,830
The gumption or the
gregariousness to break in.

405
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:56,090
So what are you doing
sets or was it I was who?

406
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,300
I don't even know what
the fuck I was doing.

407
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,860
I was working out at Barnes and noble.

408
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,920
So you are working at Barnes and noble?

409
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,793
No working out,

410
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,913
working out,

411
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:03,430
uh,

412
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:03,961
this bad.

413
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:05,130
Like you do sets of bonds?

414
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:05,420
No,

415
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,520
I was working at Barnes and noble and
then working out during the day and the

416
00:09:08,521 --> 00:09:09,354
basement.

417
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:10,500
Like I was fucking,

418
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,990
I got fired from Barnes and noble.

419
00:09:11,991 --> 00:09:15,510
This is the worst I was working at
Barnes and noble and astro place.

420
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:16,830
No fucking AC.

421
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:20,160
And so everyday I would you ever have a
job where you lift boxes and as you do,

422
00:09:20,161 --> 00:09:20,401
you're like,

423
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:21,030
that's not a bad,

424
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,290
that's a good buy workout.

425
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:22,680
And you're like,

426
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,200
oh,

427
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,521
all right,

428
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:24,480
I'll do a little bit of this.

429
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,710
And if I do this all day long,

430
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,540
I'm fucking jacked buys
by the end of the summer.

431
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:31,200
So I'd go down to the basement and
you can take the freight elevator.

432
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:33,360
I'm going to sound like a
psycho into five minutes.

433
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:36,540
You could take the freight elevator to
the basement and no one could get down

434
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:37,620
there cause you had the elevator.

435
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,210
And so once I got to the basement,

436
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,870
I take off my clothes and start
working out and just like do pushups,

437
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:43,853
sit ups,

438
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,870
fucking curls with boxes,

439
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,660
whole books out into
fucking these fucking jobs,

440
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,580
front rows and I work out.

441
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,211
And then it was,

442
00:09:51,211 --> 00:09:51,871
there was no AC.

443
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,190
So then I'd wait and I called down,

444
00:09:53,191 --> 00:09:54,330
put all my clothes back on,

445
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,480
getting the freight elevator walk up
and I just killed like 30 minutes.

446
00:09:57,481 --> 00:10:00,450
When you have a job like
that to kill 30 minutes is a,

447
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,540
it's like fucking calm that
much closer to being over done.

448
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:04,621
So I'm like,

449
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:05,000
this is,

450
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,120
and I'm eating rip fuel.

451
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:09,420
You remember ritual pop and fucking
three refuels every three hours,

452
00:10:09,421 --> 00:10:09,660
right?

453
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,411
Oh my God.

454
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:13,260
Like a tweaker running
around Shelvin travel books,

455
00:10:13,261 --> 00:10:14,130
going down to the basement,

456
00:10:14,131 --> 00:10:15,810
pounding like I'm in fucking Oz

457
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,760
and then come up sweating like a
motherfucker with a name tag on.

458
00:10:20,761 --> 00:10:21,170
Just,

459
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:21,620
uh,

460
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,950
and so like two weeks into it,

461
00:10:22,951 --> 00:10:25,140
my boss Duane pulls me
aside and he was like,

462
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:25,531
he was like,

463
00:10:25,531 --> 00:10:26,070
Hey man,

464
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,870
you've been spending a lot
of time in the basement.

465
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,620
And I was like,

466
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:28,981
Oh yeah,

467
00:10:28,981 --> 00:10:31,020
cause I got to get travel books and
that's where we keep them all down there.

468
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:31,650
And he's like,

469
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:31,801
yeah,

470
00:10:31,801 --> 00:10:33,360
do you know we have video cameras?

471
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:38,630
And I was like,

472
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,230
I didn't know that.

473
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:39,451
He's like,

474
00:10:39,451 --> 00:10:40,470
you're fucking fired.

475
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,260
And I was like,

476
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:41,940
wow,

477
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,691
I did Dwayne.

478
00:10:42,691 --> 00:10:44,640
I can explain to you is no I can't,

479
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:48,960
I can't have someone getting into their
underwear basement working out when they

480
00:10:48,961 --> 00:10:53,250
should be working and then coming back
up and then interacting with people and I

481
00:10:53,251 --> 00:10:56,310
was trying to be a comic so I was
trying to think alternatively and I'm on

482
00:10:56,311 --> 00:10:56,970
speed,

483
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,280
which is Kim.

484
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:01,830
So theoretically like
I would do funny shit,

485
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,580
but it was crazy if you
didn't know me exactly.

486
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:09,150
Some guy told me that the day we were
doing a promo shoot phrase Steve TV and I

487
00:11:09,151 --> 00:11:11,130
did a joke at the end of the
day like it was that funny.

488
00:11:11,131 --> 00:11:11,401
He goes,

489
00:11:11,401 --> 00:11:11,910
Bert,

490
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:15,510
everything you do is only funny if
you spent fucking 24 hours with you.

491
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,791
And so yeah.

492
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,480
So I got fired and then came home.

493
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:21,140
I'll be great to have that tape
if anyone at Barnes a level.

494
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,380
And so God,

495
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,700
his name is Dwayne.

496
00:11:23,701 --> 00:11:27,300
I remember he asked me if I wanted to be
a manager like a week before that and I

497
00:11:27,301 --> 00:11:27,691
was like,

498
00:11:27,691 --> 00:11:28,440
no.

499
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:28,801
And it was like,

500
00:11:28,801 --> 00:11:29,370
what?

501
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:29,851
And I was like,

502
00:11:29,851 --> 00:11:30,151
he was like,

503
00:11:30,151 --> 00:11:30,871
you don't want to be manager.

504
00:11:30,871 --> 00:11:31,171
And I was like,

505
00:11:31,171 --> 00:11:31,800
no.

506
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,101
He's like,

507
00:11:32,101 --> 00:11:32,490
why?

508
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:33,323
Why do you,

509
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,680
what do you want to do?

510
00:11:34,681 --> 00:11:35,241
Then I was like,

511
00:11:35,241 --> 00:11:36,074
I want to be a comedian.

512
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:37,081
And I was like,

513
00:11:37,081 --> 00:11:37,170
oh,

514
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,160
this isn't what I do.

515
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,240
And he looked at me dead in the face.

516
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:39,451
He goes,

517
00:11:39,451 --> 00:11:40,320
this is what you do.

518
00:11:40,321 --> 00:11:41,220
This is who you are.

519
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,420
You worked at Barnes and noble.

520
00:11:42,421 --> 00:11:43,410
Don't think you're better than us.

521
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,244
You're not.

522
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:45,571
Fuck,

523
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:46,860
I'm out of here soon.

524
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,090
I didn't know I was going to get fired,

525
00:11:48,091 --> 00:11:51,650
but don't think you're
better than us with Burke.

526
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:55,630
Chrysler was telling what I smell
might be one of the great stories.

527
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:55,961
No,

528
00:11:55,961 --> 00:11:56,620
his dad,

529
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:56,771
no,

530
00:11:56,771 --> 00:11:58,690
he used to shit his
pants and all the time.

531
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,183
All the time.

532
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,030
How long would you said the story began
with you saying that he shit his pants

533
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,930
in a banana republic in
Beverly Hills and uh,

534
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:09,521
it was,

535
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:10,181
it was like real,

536
00:12:10,181 --> 00:12:10,580
it was like,

537
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:14,350
like the real coming of age part of my
life when my dad looked at me and he was

538
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:14,591
like,

539
00:12:14,591 --> 00:12:14,801
buddy,

540
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:15,640
I'm about to shit my pants.

541
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:16,474
What do I do?

542
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:17,181
We use the word,

543
00:12:17,181 --> 00:12:17,481
it's not the,

544
00:12:17,481 --> 00:12:18,700
here's where public have a bathroom,

545
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,020
here's the fucking worst part of it,

546
00:12:20,021 --> 00:12:20,261
right?

547
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:21,730
So I look at him and I go to shit,

548
00:12:21,731 --> 00:12:22,331
your pants dad,

549
00:12:22,331 --> 00:12:24,100
I think you got to shit
your pants and I go,

550
00:12:24,101 --> 00:12:27,490
Shit your pants a little bit and then
walk as far as you can and get to your

551
00:12:27,491 --> 00:12:27,880
hotel.

552
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,511
And he just left.

553
00:12:28,511 --> 00:12:30,490
My daughter's with me like
fucking dropped on and was like,

554
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,773
I'm fucking out here.

555
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,270
And so he started walking
down Rodeo or whatever,

556
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:34,661
you know,

557
00:12:34,661 --> 00:12:35,081
Burton,

558
00:12:35,081 --> 00:12:36,730
one of those roads to get to his hotel,

559
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,270
right?

560
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,320
So my mom comes up,

561
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,160
she's like,

562
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:39,551
she's like,

563
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,241
where's your dad?

564
00:12:40,241 --> 00:12:41,074
And I said,

565
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:41,231
oh,

566
00:12:41,231 --> 00:12:42,011
he left me this sweater.

567
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:42,671
I got to buy it for.

568
00:12:42,671 --> 00:12:43,031
I bought them,

569
00:12:43,031 --> 00:12:44,260
ended up buying them the sweater and I go,

570
00:12:44,261 --> 00:12:45,100
he had he shit his pants.

571
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:46,511
She goes,

572
00:12:46,511 --> 00:12:46,811
what do you mean?

573
00:12:46,811 --> 00:12:47,201
He had his shit,

574
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:47,531
his pants.

575
00:12:47,531 --> 00:12:47,720
I go,

576
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,170
he ended up,

577
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:48,940
he had his shit,

578
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,320
so he shit his pants and then he just,

579
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,610
he's walking on the street.

580
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:51,881
I go,

581
00:12:51,881 --> 00:12:52,691
I'm sure we can catch him.

582
00:12:52,691 --> 00:12:54,790
He's walking slow and
then my wife comes up.

583
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,061
She goes,

584
00:12:55,061 --> 00:12:55,511
where's your dad?

585
00:12:55,511 --> 00:12:55,721
And I go,

586
00:12:55,721 --> 00:12:56,260
he shit his pants.

587
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:56,560
He goes,

588
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,640
why didn't you just use the bathroom?

589
00:12:57,641 --> 00:12:57,851
I said,

590
00:12:57,851 --> 00:12:58,331
where's the bathroom?

591
00:12:58,331 --> 00:12:59,830
She goes downstairs and I went,

592
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:00,101
Ooh,

593
00:13:00,101 --> 00:13:01,690
I probably should have
told him that and so

594
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,440
I didn't know I was in panic mode.

595
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,920
It was black Friday and I'm waiting in
line too when I've got a leather jacket

596
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:09,541
on sale,

597
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:13,120
but it's even worse I think if you shit
your pants in line for the bathroom

598
00:13:13,121 --> 00:13:15,340
because then everybody's going to know
if there's a big line of people and you

599
00:13:15,341 --> 00:13:17,530
just blow up is dumping your pants,

600
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,630
then you're like close proximity.

601
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,450
No way to play off shitting your
pain when you shit your pants.

602
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:25,120
I say this shitting your pants
is a lot like getting a Dui.

603
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,930
You roll the dice so much and get away
with it that when you do get caught with

604
00:13:28,931 --> 00:13:29,770
your hand and cookie jar,

605
00:13:29,771 --> 00:13:32,740
you're like mother fucker and then she
never thought that was going to happen.

606
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,950
Are you kidding me?

607
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,380
All the time.

608
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,320
Why today?

609
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,560
Oh that's so true.

610
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:44,020
When his thirties he was running marathons
and he used to shoot his pants all

611
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,590
the time.

612
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,130
Not even like,

613
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:46,060
I'm not even saying like,

614
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:46,780
I'm not even saying like,

615
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,300
oh once a month.

616
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,560
I'm talking once a week.

617
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,400
He would,

618
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,020
this is before cell phones too.

619
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:55,690
He was in his thirties he
was in his thirties I was a,

620
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,111
I was a kid.

621
00:13:56,111 --> 00:13:59,590
We were living in north Tampa and
not in like the nicer north Tampa,

622
00:13:59,591 --> 00:14:01,630
but in the Shittier redneck verse,

623
00:14:01,631 --> 00:14:02,650
Black North Tampa.

624
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,570
And a first time I ever heard her,

625
00:14:04,571 --> 00:14:05,800
the n word was in this neighborhood.

626
00:14:05,801 --> 00:14:06,820
But my dad used to run marathons,

627
00:14:06,821 --> 00:14:09,010
so we'd run like five miles,

628
00:14:09,011 --> 00:14:09,641
10 miles,

629
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:11,590
and you can go out and
on these 10 mile runs,

630
00:14:11,591 --> 00:14:12,424
he shit his pants.

631
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,080
So he go into these orange groves,

632
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:14,921
shit himself,

633
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:15,310
right.

634
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,050
Clean himself the best he
could and then run home.

635
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,120
But there were some nights,

636
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,410
I remember these distinctly,

637
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,630
it was before cell phones were
to get dark and my mom's like,

638
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,950
we've got to go look for your dad.

639
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,190
And we'd be driving his route where he'd
run and all of a sudden like a naked

640
00:14:27,191 --> 00:14:27,700
happy.

641
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,800
My Dad would come out of
the fucking orange groves.

642
00:14:29,801 --> 00:14:29,980
Like,

643
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:30,640
I'm here,

644
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,260
give me in the car right now.

645
00:14:32,261 --> 00:14:33,850
If he knew who he come get him,

646
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,040
oh yeah,

647
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:35,730
it would be.

648
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:38,740
I remember thundering lightning and he's
just sitting in an orange grove naked.

649
00:14:38,741 --> 00:14:38,831
Like,

650
00:14:38,831 --> 00:14:40,620
how did he shit his pants and,

651
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,520
and we'd be like over
here and he'd be like,

652
00:14:42,521 --> 00:14:42,881
all right,

653
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:43,810
and you just hop in the front seat,

654
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,261
go home,

655
00:14:44,261 --> 00:14:45,970
let's go like real quick.

656
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,470
He shit his pants.

657
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,020
He hates my stories.

658
00:14:50,021 --> 00:14:50,621
I hope someone,

659
00:14:50,621 --> 00:14:51,650
if anyone is listening to this,

660
00:14:51,651 --> 00:14:52,484
knows my dad.

661
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:57,520
Let him listen to this because every
fucking story I ever tell he fucking Oise

662
00:14:58,341 --> 00:14:58,611
goes,

663
00:14:58,611 --> 00:14:59,421
God damn,

664
00:14:59,421 --> 00:15:00,680
you're fucking imagination.

665
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,350
I would fuck I did not shit my pants.

666
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,760
I Shit a little bit.

667
00:15:04,761 --> 00:15:05,594
I didn't shit.

668
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,160
You ready to people
taking a shit in my pants.

669
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,570
He just squirts.

670
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,500
He's just a little squirter.

671
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:09,980
I Dunno.

672
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,090
Let's call him on the phone.

673
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:11,930
Do it just,

674
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:13,040
I didn't even go lucid.

675
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,930
Like I didn't try to
control it or move around.

676
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,370
I just let the dream play out.

677
00:15:16,371 --> 00:15:18,380
But I realized it was a dream
and I still didn't wake up.

678
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:18,950
I have,

679
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,150
that's a rare thing.

680
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,010
Pills just for that shit.

681
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:23,451
Dreams.

682
00:15:23,451 --> 00:15:24,290
I have dreams,

683
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,360
I have fucking crazy dreams,

684
00:15:26,361 --> 00:15:28,520
but I am totally lucid inside my dreams.

685
00:15:28,521 --> 00:15:31,160
Like all dreams that I'm
reading something and I'll go,

686
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:31,890
I'll be,

687
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:32,301
I'm going to go.

688
00:15:32,301 --> 00:15:32,511
Wow,

689
00:15:32,511 --> 00:15:35,420
that's so funny that I'm reading something
because nothing's there in the dream.

690
00:15:35,421 --> 00:15:36,170
I'll pick this.

691
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,390
Nothing's there in my mind
is making up these words,

692
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,410
but I'm still reading them.

693
00:15:39,411 --> 00:15:40,310
That's so interesting.

694
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,090
I had a dream one time that me and Elvis
walked into his hotel room and there

695
00:15:44,091 --> 00:15:44,901
were four dudes,

696
00:15:44,901 --> 00:15:45,630
but fucking

697
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:45,990
right,

698
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:48,180
and I just hear me where they were.

699
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:52,400
So just that might be one of
the best sentences ever created.

700
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:56,700
I had a dream that I was with Elvis
and we walked into his dressing room.

701
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:57,770
There was four dudes,

702
00:15:57,771 --> 00:15:59,210
but fucking dot,

703
00:15:59,211 --> 00:15:59,571
dot,

704
00:15:59,571 --> 00:16:00,050
dot.

705
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:01,130
Now hear me out.

706
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:02,950
It's weird.

707
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:03,231
Weirder.

708
00:16:03,231 --> 00:16:05,430
They're throwing up in
Burger King cups should

709
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,450
just fucking each other.

710
00:16:08,451 --> 00:16:10,460
And then I swear to you when I say this,

711
00:16:10,461 --> 00:16:12,140
I fucking just shut the door.

712
00:16:12,141 --> 00:16:12,891
And I looked at Elvis.

713
00:16:12,891 --> 00:16:13,071
I go,

714
00:16:13,071 --> 00:16:14,330
what the fuck's going on in your room?

715
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,640
He said to me,

716
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,320
what your dream Baby Shit.

717
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:22,851
I wake up,

718
00:16:22,851 --> 00:16:23,421
I wake up.

719
00:16:23,421 --> 00:16:24,050
I'm like,

720
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:24,501
wake up.

721
00:16:24,501 --> 00:16:25,960
Check my Dick and make sure it's on board.

722
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,430
And then I'm like,

723
00:16:27,431 --> 00:16:28,264
well,

724
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,630
you really flipped me out.

725
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:33,710
You don't really put me out.

726
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:34,640
Not that,

727
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,590
not that the guys were both fucking right.

728
00:16:36,591 --> 00:16:37,424
That did bother me.

729
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,210
No,

730
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:39,470
it was the product placement.

731
00:16:39,471 --> 00:16:42,510
Like what the fuck did
Burger King do to get it?

732
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,540
If they figured it out,

733
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,570
you just don't know that they are.

734
00:16:47,571 --> 00:16:50,110
It's way to interject
advertising into your dream.

735
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:50,993
It's

736
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,070
burger king in the future.

737
00:16:53,071 --> 00:16:53,371
Right now.

738
00:16:53,371 --> 00:16:56,560
It's like I got her Chrysler stream about
the Elvis and the Butt fucking high,

739
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,280
Huh?

740
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:57,511
No,

741
00:16:57,511 --> 00:16:57,721
no,

742
00:16:57,721 --> 00:16:57,901
no.

743
00:16:57,901 --> 00:16:58,291
But what is,

744
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:03,291
there's a possibility that someone
could insert a product right to a dream,

745
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:04,140
right?

746
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,230
They could give you a cheeseburger
and in that cheeseburger with some

747
00:17:07,231 --> 00:17:11,880
experimental thing that would make you
think about burger king in a dream and

748
00:17:11,881 --> 00:17:13,200
see a burger and a dream,

749
00:17:13,201 --> 00:17:13,591
you can do it.

750
00:17:13,591 --> 00:17:14,160
You can do it.

751
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,480
I fucking girl from behind.

752
00:17:15,481 --> 00:17:16,770
It's going Geico and shit.

753
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,120
Yes.

754
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:18,953
In the future.

755
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:22,260
But that doesn't make any sense
cause you product duck noises.

756
00:17:22,261 --> 00:17:23,094
It's Geico.

757
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,990
Eat something to have this happen to you.

758
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,040
We're still,

759
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,520
we're still missing the whole flag.

760
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,700
We're stumbling on something
very brilliant right now.

761
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,960
Can we get to the flag bill those
first cause we might forget.

762
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,330
Yes.

763
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:33,571
Okay.

764
00:17:33,571 --> 00:17:34,261
Calling dildos.

765
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:34,681
Here we go.

766
00:17:34,681 --> 00:17:36,180
So I called Joe,

767
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:36,991
this is what you said.

768
00:17:36,991 --> 00:17:37,824
You Go,

769
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,170
we were just talking
about this dude like yeah,

770
00:17:40,171 --> 00:17:42,560
you've got so many crazy stories
that have happened to you and it and,

771
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:42,771
and,

772
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:42,930
and,

773
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:43,800
but I never think that,

774
00:17:43,801 --> 00:17:44,970
I think there are just things in my life.

775
00:17:44,971 --> 00:17:45,751
I think it's my ability,

776
00:17:45,751 --> 00:17:48,960
the way I see something
happen is different than the
way everyone else sees it.

777
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:49,501
You know,

778
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:50,250
I see the,

779
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,380
the little thing that
that registers in me,

780
00:17:52,381 --> 00:17:53,071
I go all,

781
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:53,904
that's my thing,

782
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,301
you know,

783
00:17:54,301 --> 00:17:58,290
and it lights up for me where my wife
just glazes over it and it's come to light

784
00:17:58,291 --> 00:17:59,540
in this podcast more than anything.

785
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,240
The machine,

786
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:00,631
I mean,

787
00:18:00,631 --> 00:18:02,820
the way I've told the story
to fucking a million people,

788
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,530
but then when I told him to do
something lit up and I went,

789
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:04,691
oh,

790
00:18:04,691 --> 00:18:05,524
that is a good story,

791
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,030
right?

792
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,470
The fucking fighting a bear,

793
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:08,341
the fuck everything.

794
00:18:08,341 --> 00:18:09,780
I'm getting mauled by a bull,

795
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,680
Tracy Morgan,

796
00:18:10,681 --> 00:18:11,580
everything's lights up.

797
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:13,800
So then I'm talking on the phone today.

798
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,750
I [inaudible] you.

799
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:14,911
Hey,

800
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:17,460
can you do by saying I guess and you go,

801
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:18,620
I said,

802
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:21,630
I'm on the phone with Delta American
Airlines trying to get upgraded.

803
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:21,961
Your like,

804
00:18:21,961 --> 00:18:22,411
where you going?

805
00:18:22,411 --> 00:18:23,244
I said Amsterdam.

806
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:24,250
He said,

807
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:24,811
I've never been there.

808
00:18:24,811 --> 00:18:25,380
I said,

809
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:25,561
oh,

810
00:18:25,561 --> 00:18:26,110
whatever you do,

811
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:26,671
if you ever go there,

812
00:18:26,671 --> 00:18:27,870
don't go see flying dildos.

813
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:28,591
True Story.

814
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:28,831
Right.

815
00:18:28,831 --> 00:18:29,610
So,

816
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,920
so I'm fucking like 22 Ahmed,

817
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,480
I'm an in Amsterdam,

818
00:18:33,481 --> 00:18:37,350
where would the like five friends and
there and of course we do the rounds and

819
00:18:37,351 --> 00:18:38,910
Amsterdam and get fucking lit up.

820
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,460
Heineken factory,

821
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,690
hedge hubs.

822
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,070
I think even maybe my showrooms,

823
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:49,800
we walked by this live sex show and
it says on the billboard guy on girl,

824
00:18:49,801 --> 00:18:51,510
girl on girl oral sex,

825
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,140
uh,

826
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:52,411
this,

827
00:18:52,411 --> 00:18:52,711
this,

828
00:18:52,711 --> 00:18:55,320
this and then the last
one is flying dildos.

829
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,980
Come see flying dildos.

830
00:18:56,981 --> 00:18:58,320
Since all Mike fucking,

831
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,910
I tell everyone we're seeing fine dildos.

832
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,200
I want to see fucking flying deal does.

833
00:19:01,201 --> 00:19:03,090
That to me is a showstopper.

834
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,700
That is something that I will
buy tickets for everyone for us.

835
00:19:05,701 --> 00:19:06,534
Why buy us all tickets?

836
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:08,400
We go in to see a lot of sex
or have you ever seen one?

837
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,450
No,

838
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:10,470
it's basically like,

839
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,820
like half a boxing ring.

840
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:16,290
So it's like you walk in and it's stadium
seating and then half a boxing ring

841
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,420
where they just without
the ropes and they just,

842
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,680
everything happens right there.

843
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,690
They just fuck it.

844
00:19:20,691 --> 00:19:22,120
Just fuck and Oh,

845
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,940
and our dudes beating
off and the audience,

846
00:19:23,941 --> 00:19:24,990
are you allowed to wear lipstick?

847
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,321
No.

848
00:19:25,321 --> 00:19:26,790
Dudes aren't beating off in the audience.

849
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:27,490
No,

850
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:28,051
it's a Chi.

851
00:19:28,051 --> 00:19:30,300
It is kind of creepy now that you say
that because I don't know what we were

852
00:19:30,301 --> 00:19:30,721
supposed to do,

853
00:19:30,721 --> 00:19:32,070
but there was like 20 people in there,

854
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,770
but we sat neck yet can,

855
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,710
I guess maybe you should have been,

856
00:19:34,711 --> 00:19:36,330
but we didn't and we
ruined it for everyone.

857
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:37,230
Um,

858
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,730
so we sit down and they're like,

859
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,860
and then they come out and they're like,

860
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:40,540
the first is,

861
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,250
um,

862
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:41,970
girl on girl.

863
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,020
This is just like ut a porn,

864
00:19:43,021 --> 00:19:43,201
right?

865
00:19:43,201 --> 00:19:45,090
So two girls come out and they're like,

866
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:49,170
like they got to eat and just think of
two girls come out and start going flying

867
00:19:49,171 --> 00:19:51,690
dildos flying doulos and they're like,

868
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:51,901
no,

869
00:19:51,901 --> 00:19:52,980
we're not playing dildos.

870
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:53,511
I go,

871
00:19:53,511 --> 00:19:54,600

874
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,320
So they do their thing,

875
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:00,420
they leave a girl comes out by herself,

876
00:20:00,421 --> 00:20:02,670

flying dildos and she goes,

877
00:20:02,671 --> 00:20:02,881

883
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:09,840

884
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:11,130
nine acts coming to the stage.

885
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,480
How about get along is each one doing

blowing a dude and then the guy fucks

887
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,080

888
00:20:19,081 --> 00:20:19,600

00:23:23,591 --> 00:23:25,450
there's like real parrots out here.

1012
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:26,440
Yeah.

1013
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,940
Like this is the weirdest shit ever.

1014
00:23:27,941 --> 00:23:29,980
Like their parakeets and parents.

1015
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:30,791
And I'm like,

1016
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:31,930
these are like tropical birds.

1017
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:33,370
Like Miami's tropics.

1018
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,600
It is the tropics.

1019
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:35,530
It is a tropics.

1020
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:36,360
Yeah.

1021
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,151
Barely America.

1022
00:23:37,151 --> 00:23:37,984
Right.

1023
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,360
Let's be realistic.

1024
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,030
It's too awesome to be a matter of,

1025
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,040
it's too crazy and too,

1026
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,630
Cubans got in and just made it tropical.

1027
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,130
They've been at tropical.

1028
00:23:49,131 --> 00:23:49,964
We're going to Cuba,

1029
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,350
Cuba,

1030
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,570
do a trip flip Cuba.

1031
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,110
Oh Dude.

1032
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:54,861
I want to,

1033
00:23:54,861 --> 00:23:58,340
Cuba opened up relations as well as the
best thing about the show right now.

1034
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:58,850
Yeah.

1035
00:23:58,850 --> 00:23:59,091
Yeah.

1036
00:23:59,091 --> 00:23:59,640
I would love to.

1037
00:23:59,640 --> 00:23:59,880
Yeah.

1038
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,130
Those parakeets are parents.

1039
00:24:01,131 --> 00:24:01,460
One of them.

1040
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,570
He said the Burbank parrots.

1041
00:24:02,571 --> 00:24:02,691
Yeah.

1042
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,070
These are actual words.

1043
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,023
Actual parents.

1044
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:05,923
Yeah.

1045
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:08,330
They come through him
down because of Youtube.

1046
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:09,740
What?

1047
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,150
I know these are just still pictures.

1048
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:11,810
Oh,

1049
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:13,550
did they come from people that were,

1050
00:24:13,551 --> 00:24:13,760
uh,

1051
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,690
that had him as pat,

1052
00:24:14,691 --> 00:24:14,931
sir.

1053
00:24:14,931 --> 00:24:15,764
What'd they come from?

1054
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:16,630
You know,

1055
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,211
there's no,

1056
00:24:17,211 --> 00:24:19,130
there's just rumors because Disney's,

1057
00:24:19,131 --> 00:24:19,830
there said,

1058
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,530
lot of people think that Walt Disney's,

1059
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,890
it was Walt Disney's parrots
and he just hasn't shown,

1060
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,550
we find out they're fake.

1061
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:27,860
They're not powerless.

1062
00:24:27,861 --> 00:24:29,930
Walt Disney is such a motherfucker.

1063
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,690
He's got fake parents
out there flying around.

1064
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:34,130
Shitting on people.

1065
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:36,441
Yeah.

1066
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:37,274
I had a bird,

1067
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,760
had bird feeders out I bought recently
and they found out about it and now they

1068
00:24:40,761 --> 00:24:41,900
won't leave my house alone.

1069
00:24:41,901 --> 00:24:42,980
They're there like every day.

1070
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:44,803
Amazing.

1071
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:45,891
Cool Dude.

1072
00:24:45,891 --> 00:24:46,730
That's pretty dope.

1073
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:47,270
Yeah.

1074
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:49,040
They're loud too loud that
they're annoying as fuck.

1075
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:49,973
No,

1076
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,700
you didn't hear plugs on.

1077
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:52,600
Put that.

1078
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,940
Let them into your spiritual compass.

1079
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:55,551
Yeah,

1080
00:24:55,551 --> 00:24:56,600
bring them into your center.

1081
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:57,500
I will.

1082
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,510
That seems like an amazing thing
to have in your neighborhood,

1083
00:24:59,511 --> 00:24:59,830
man.

1084
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:00,071
Oh,

1085
00:25:00,071 --> 00:25:00,620
that's cool.

1086
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,240
And it's really cool because it's a,

1087
00:25:02,241 --> 00:25:03,950
I live in equestrian place,

1088
00:25:03,951 --> 00:25:05,240
so there's horses and parrots.

1089
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:07,910
It must smell awesome.

1090
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,480
Horse Shit and bird shit
all stood up together.

1091
00:25:11,481 --> 00:25:12,650
And the Burbank son.

1092
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,280
How is it that it's illegal if
you don't clean up after your dog,

1093
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:18,770
but you're allowed to just have
your fucking horse shit everywhere.

1094
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,473
Empty.

1095
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:22,220
It's giant asshole.

1096
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:26,420
1200 pound body of stewed grasses.

1097
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,061
I'm sorry.

1098
00:25:34,061 --> 00:25:35,070
Is this cobblestone?

1099
00:25:35,071 --> 00:25:36,070
It's just a dirt road.

1100
00:25:36,071 --> 00:25:36,640
You farmer.

1101
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,320
Fuck.

1102
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,280
Pick up after that donkey.

1103
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:41,081
Your donkey.

1104
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,910
Just shit all over my Prius.

1105
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:46,360
Your dog does not that green.

1106
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,580
This is contributing to global warming.

1107
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,830
Donkey was dirty ass.

1108
00:25:52,831 --> 00:25:53,430
All.

1109
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:55,630
Brian said he didn't like
Paris in his neighborhood.

1110
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,820
He's in bed with the chicken.

1111
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,673
He's like,

1112
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,100
I never said it.

1113
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,293
Oh my God.

1114
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:27,080
They're bringing the fucking
parrots into the courthouse.

1115
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:33,250
We would now like to call
the prosecution witness.

1116
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:36,830
The Burbank Paris never showed us before.

1117
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:38,781
Not Roofing.

1118
00:26:38,781 --> 00:26:39,830
What are you talking about?

1119
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:40,664
Are you serious?

1120
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,143
Oh,

1121
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:44,911
no,

1122
00:26:44,911 --> 00:26:46,200
two heads is fine.

1123
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,710
I take two hits all the time and I drive

1124
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,413
ingrown hair.

1125
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:57,901
You know,

1126
00:26:57,901 --> 00:27:00,800
all you need to do is you
need to do with that stuff.

1127
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:04,650
Kills everything.

1128
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:08,880
It'll tell it all.

1129
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:11,181
How about,

1130
00:27:11,181 --> 00:27:12,014
how about the,

1131
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:15,620
the defense attorney and
the judge was badgering,

1132
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:19,530
badgering the witness in the
objection and then brush here.

1133
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:19,970
He goes,

1134
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:20,310
hmm.

1135
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,490
Probably want to Greg too far.

1136
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,413
Too Far.

1137
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:31,910
Okay.
