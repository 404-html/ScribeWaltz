1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,370
The Joe Rogan experience

2
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,010
freaks and geeks lovers in children.
What's going on?

3
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:52,130
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the podcast and our guest 

4
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,970
today is the one and only Mr.
Dave Foley Day Foley's in the house.

5
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,240
Thank you.
Holla.

6
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:56,180
Dave.
Our.

7
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,400
Our podcast is sponsored by fleshlight.
I don't know if you've ever utilize one 

8
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,520
of these masturbatory devices.
Can I try that during this interview?

9
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,890
I'm sure that's the butthole version.
That's the.

10
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,350
But I don't recommend you jump right 
into the deep end.

11
00:01:10,351 --> 00:01:12,360
It's like trying heroin before you tried
pot,

12
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,380
but it's tight and I don't know.
It's well.

13
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:21,410
Yeah,
but I usually a live the butthole I 

14
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:25,101
like.
I like someone to apologize to so I 

15
00:01:25,101 --> 00:01:26,250
don't know if this is really good for 
me.

16
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:28,680
Yeah,
it might develop some bad social habits.

17
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,020
Forced.
Forced yourself on it.

18
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:31,950
Just baby.
I know,

19
00:01:31,951 --> 00:01:32,370
I know,
baby.

20
00:01:32,371 --> 00:01:35,460
Just let me get through this.
What a terrible,

21
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:36,570
terrible thing.

22
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,920
What is that?
Is that.

23
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,950
What does the instincts that I dunno,
but anal sex was so popular with the 

24
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,160
young people these days.
I think that is because of the porn.

25
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:49,440
The porn is fuck the kids heads.
I think it's two things as the porn and 

26
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,491
it's the Bush administration really,
because there was actually this study 

27
00:01:52,491 --> 00:01:52,760
each other said like eight years of,
uh,

28
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,200
of abstinence,
only education in the US.

29
00:01:55,230 --> 00:02:00,230
They got rid of anything other than 
abstinence only education in the 

30
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,261
schools.
So all these kids have grown up 

31
00:02:03,261 --> 00:02:03,261
thinking.
All right,

32
00:02:03,261 --> 00:02:03,930
well if they take it in the ass,
there's still virgins.

33
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,580
Whoa.
Ran.

34
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,400
Yeah.
So all these,

35
00:02:06,401 --> 00:02:11,290
like Christian kids in the Bible belt 
are all having anal sex because of this.

36
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,180
But the blowback,
it's unintentional blowback.

37
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:19,270
There was always a few girls like that 
when we were young that did you know 

38
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,210
that they were still virgins if they 
took in the ass.

39
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,190
There was like one or two girls that you
had heard about,

40
00:02:23,191 --> 00:02:24,840
but they were always like a joke.
Yeah.

41
00:02:24,841 --> 00:02:28,530
I never,
I never met a girl in,

42
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,540
you know,
before both my two marriages.

43
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,760
Not until after.
Not until I became single again.

44
00:02:32,761 --> 00:02:34,800
This third time have I ever met girls 
that,

45
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,410
that,
that were in the anal sex really ever.

46
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,240
You can find them.
They're out there.

47
00:02:39,241 --> 00:02:39,990
I know,
but I,

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
you know,
people that are allergic to peanut 

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,000
butter,
you don't,

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,230
it's not that common that peanut butter 
can kill you.

51
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:47,940
Yeah.
But you're going to meet them.

52
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,140
You're going to meet them.
Yeah.

53
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,590
Especially if you're out there on the 
hunt for out there getting crazy looking

54
00:02:52,591 --> 00:02:54,210
to stick things in people's butts.
Oh,

55
00:02:54,211 --> 00:02:55,830
I thought you meant an out on the hunt 
for peanut allergy.

56
00:02:55,831 --> 00:02:58,910
People know because that is a sexy.
That is a secretary.

57
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,840
I love fucking me.
Some peanut allergy people.

58
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,260
Yeah.
They,

59
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,100
they don't have a lot of resistance.
No,

60
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,720
no.
They give up easy.

61
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:16,140
So I'm uh,
Dave and I have known each other since 

62
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,200
1994 when I first started doing,
uh,

63
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:21,130
when I first started acting really news 
radio was one of the first acting things

64
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:26,131
I'd ever done.
We had done one other Sitcom before 

65
00:03:26,131 --> 00:03:26,131
that.
You had your own.

66
00:03:26,131 --> 00:03:26,131
Did this cardboard bose?
Yeah,

67
00:03:26,131 --> 00:03:27,430
absolutely.
Terrible,

68
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,470
terrible,
terrible,

69
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,090
terrible word you've invented.
I'm,

70
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:36,150
yeah.
I should throw a couple other apps in 

71
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,000
there.
It was you and Mike Star,

72
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:37,510
right?
Yeah.

73
00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:39,010
And um,
there's another guy,

74
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,290
bruce,
I think his name was greenwood.

75
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:43,450
He's always been,
he was like in star track.

76
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,400
He played Captain Kirk's Dad,
you know,

77
00:03:45,401 --> 00:03:50,401
he's,
he's always doing a bunch of different 

78
00:03:50,401 --> 00:03:50,401
things.
There was a few of an alley.

79
00:03:50,401 --> 00:03:50,401
Um,
God,

80
00:03:50,401 --> 00:03:50,710
what's her name?
Uh,

81
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,060
fuck.
I forgot her name,

82
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,550
but she's married to George 
Stephanopoulos.

83
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:55,930
Oh yeah,
I know,

84
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,270
I know what you mean.
Very nice girl.

85
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,920
I remember her name either.
Alexandra Wentworth.

86
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,960
Yes.
And uh,

87
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:07,260
yeah,
it was terrible show and it was really 

88
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,821
funny premise and it was written by 
these guys who had written the simpsons 

89
00:04:08,821 --> 00:04:08,860
and they'd worked on married with 
children.

90
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,290
Kevin Kern and Jeff Martin.
Really funny guys,

91
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:14,500
but they were very much writers.
They were very quiet guys.

92
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:18,520
There were little socially awkward and 
the network just did not think that they

93
00:04:18,521 --> 00:04:21,130
would be able to handle producing a 
show.

94
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:26,370
So they brought in this ultimate hack.
I don't even remember his name was bill 

95
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,000
something or another,
but he was death.

96
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,920
Every joke was death is.
All of his instincts were terrible.

97
00:04:32,921 --> 00:04:35,050
It was just the worst,
most hacky shit.

98
00:04:35,051 --> 00:04:36,850
The guy who never said a funny thing in 
his life.

99
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,840
So I got to see the worst aspect of 
Hollywood and then,

100
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,860
uh,
I was totally ready to bail and go back 

101
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:45,860
to New York and just go back to doing 
standup.

102
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,830
But unfortunately I leased a fucking 
apartment because I was convinced that 

103
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,380
this show is going to be successful.
Like every idiot.

104
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,820
Yeah.
So,

105
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:56,821
um,
I'd stayed around and then next thing 

106
00:04:56,821 --> 00:04:56,821
you know,
News Radio,

107
00:04:56,821 --> 00:04:58,170
thanks to Ray Romano being fired in 
rehearsals.

108
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,620
Yeah.
So what was that like?

109
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:01,480
You were there in the pilot.
I was not.

110
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,040
Well,
yeah,

111
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,480
what would,
just didn't work out?

112
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,800
Just the wrong character.
I mean,

113
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,610
I guess ray knew things weren't going 
well.

114
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:11,410
I didn't really perceive that he was 
having any real problems,

115
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:12,430
you know,
it makes sense.

116
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,640
But he,
he would rate,

117
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,260
would come up to me like a man,
you gotta help me out here.

118
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:20,050
You can't go.
I gotta get a joke in here and I gotta I

119
00:05:20,051 --> 00:05:25,051
gotTa make this funny somehow.
And maybe it was just the stench of 

120
00:05:25,051 --> 00:05:25,051
nervousness.
Yeah.

121
00:05:25,051 --> 00:05:26,650
So he was like a panic now I guess he 
was,

122
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,160
you know.

123
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,050
And then,
uh,

124
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:29,980
it was then I got the call.
Yeah.

125
00:05:29,981 --> 00:05:32,500
I got that call from Paul and then 
saying,

126
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,190
oh,
well we're going to let ray go.

127
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:37,570
And never.
That's ready though.

128
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:40,030
All the time thinking that something's 
going terrible.

129
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:45,490
He's like,
one of those guys always thinks that 

130
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:45,490
things are going wrong.
There was a recent,

131
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:50,270
he did an interview on the Green Room 
that Paul provenza show where he said 

132
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:54,271
that still to this day,
he goes onstage and the audience cheers 

133
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:54,370
and he feels like a fraud,
you know,

134
00:05:54,371 --> 00:05:55,930
he steps out there,
they love him,

135
00:05:55,931 --> 00:05:57,160
you know,
fucking 10 years.

136
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,370
A Great Sitcom,

137
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,950
a great standup comic.
Ali's people love him.

138
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,950
They don't even like me.
This is very,

139
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
he gets out there and it just weirds out
the fact that all these people actually 

140
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,790
like him,
you know.

141
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,110
And then there was the guy that did the 
part during the pilot and then just that

142
00:06:15,111 --> 00:06:17,700
was it for him.
They just didn't use them after that.

143
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,510
Yeah.
I forget his name now.

144
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:25,570
Bill.
I don't even think they considered this 

145
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:25,570
poor fuck.
No,

146
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:26,370
he was just there as an interim filler.
Yeah.

147
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,370
Which is a horrible position to be in.
Yeah.

148
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:32,990
So I was in my apartment and uh,
I had a deal with NBC,

149
00:06:32,991 --> 00:06:34,880
some,
some sort of a development deal and they

150
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:39,881
said,
well there's a show that we would like 

151
00:06:39,881 --> 00:06:41,201
you to read for if you're interested.
And then they gave me the tape and I 

152
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:41,960
remember thinking,
Holy Shit,

153
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:43,100
this is fucking good.

154
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,240
Like,
like this.

155
00:06:44,241 --> 00:06:46,940
No Way I can get on the show.
Like this is like a real show,

156
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,800
like the other hardball show.
At least.

157
00:06:48,801 --> 00:06:53,780
It sort of made sense like why they 
picked me with zero acting ever to be on

158
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:54,500
this Sitcom.
Oh,

159
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:56,850
because they're idiots and they don't 
know what the fuck they doing,

160
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:02,170
you know?
But all of a sudden this was like this 

161
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:02,170
real NPC show.
And I was like,

162
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:02,170
Holy Shit,
you know,

163
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:04,250
I can still remember being there on the 
first day of set.

164
00:07:04,251 --> 00:07:09,251
I'm like,
I'm fucking sitting right next to Phil 

165
00:07:09,251 --> 00:07:09,251
Hartman.
Like how weird is this?

166
00:07:09,251 --> 00:07:09,500
You know,
I literally had,

167
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:13,230
when I got my development deal,
they made me take some acting classes.

168
00:07:13,231 --> 00:07:16,640
So I took some one-on-one acting classes
with some crazy failed actress,

169
00:07:16,641 --> 00:07:21,641
woman in New York who was unbelievably 
bitter and play like weird psychological

170
00:07:22,281 --> 00:07:27,281
games with you.
They don't give your teaching 

171
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:27,281
certificate unless you're unbelievably 
bitter.

172
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,840
She was brutal.
And then she was trying to angle a job.

173
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,180
She kept trying to angle a job to play 
my mother.

174
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:37,840
I'm like,
I don't think there's a mom and this 

175
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:37,840
fucking script.
Crazy bitch.

176
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,780
Well,
if there's a thing that comes up to play

177
00:07:38,781 --> 00:07:40,430
your mom,
you're going to use it right now.

178
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,510
Like,
Oh God.

179
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,310
Yeah.
And all of a sudden we're on news radio.

180
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,800
It's crazy.
Yeah.

181
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:46,850
Yeah.
It was a.

182
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,460
because we.
Well,

183
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:49,600
we had a different.
Cause it was a,

184
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,700
uh,
the joe character was different animals.

185
00:07:52,701 --> 00:07:53,910
So the Catherine character was 
different.

186
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,490
A different actor playing catherine.
Oh,

187
00:07:55,491 --> 00:07:57,000
reality.
Yeah.

188
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,590
I forgot about that.
Candy both came in at the same time.

189
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:01,520
Wow,
that's crazy.

190
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,590
I just ran into candy recently at the 
airport.

191
00:08:03,591 --> 00:08:06,920
She still looks like she's 30 years old.
I'm raising black.

192
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:09,500
Don't crack baby.
Some about those genes.

193
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,650
It's amazing.
Yeah.

194
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,580
Looks fantastic.
She's healthy and vibrant,

195
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:18,750
yet survived as CSI Miami,
and she bolted from that show too.

196
00:08:19,671 --> 00:08:20,420
I told her,
I saw her.

197
00:08:20,421 --> 00:08:20,810
I said,
Oh,

198
00:08:20,811 --> 00:08:21,830
I'm not on that show anymore,
honey.

199
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:26,750
She's famous for leaving shows.
She is gorgeous.

200
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,610
She's a.
she's a wild bitch.

201
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:32,150
She's crazy.
And Kenny Alexander is awesome.

202
00:08:32,151 --> 00:08:34,610
I love her when she's legitimately wild.
Like she,

203
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:39,660
she doesn't take any shit.
She quit newsradio because she wasn't 

204
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:39,660
getting enough jokes.
I mean,

205
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:44,500
she just decided there's a TV show on 
the air and it's doing really well and 

206
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,680
she's getting some silly amount of money
every week and she's like,

207
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,630
nope,
I'm not.

208
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,470
They're not appreciating me.
I'm gone.

209
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,770
And the writers were completely in 
denial about it.

210
00:08:51,771 --> 00:08:52,930
It was the weirdest thing,
you know,

211
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,860
when it came up and they're like,
well,

212
00:08:54,861 --> 00:08:55,740
that's not true.
Right?

213
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,360
Like,
what the fuck you talking about,

214
00:08:57,361 --> 00:08:57,660
man?

215
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,290
Yeah.
No,

216
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:02,440
a bunch of white guys from Harvard.
We're not able to write for a,

217
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:04,260
for a black woman,
a black woman.

218
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:09,290
Well,
it didn't even seem like it's almost 

219
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:09,290
seemed like they just didn't bother you.
No,

220
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:09,390
they didn't.
They didn't even try.

221
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,380
It was just,
you know,

222
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:13,260
they had her there and then if it fit in
they could use her,

223
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:18,261
but occasionally they put the word honey
at the start of a sentence when you're 

224
00:09:18,261 --> 00:09:21,630
on a show and there's eight people as 
Sitcom was such a weird environment,

225
00:09:21,631 --> 00:09:26,631
you know,
in eight people are struggling to get 

226
00:09:26,631 --> 00:09:26,631
their own little thing in,
you know,

227
00:09:26,631 --> 00:09:31,040
it's a weird little tense environment 
can be very strange and for her I guess 

228
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,120
it was just disappointing over and over 
and over again.

229
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,350
Yeah.
Yeah.

230
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:37,320
For a lot of people liked that show.
I don't know this,

231
00:09:37,321 --> 00:09:42,321
and this is a very odd pardon history,
but Dave Foley literally wrote half of 

232
00:09:43,411 --> 00:09:46,670
that show and half of it on the set.
Like you.

233
00:09:46,671 --> 00:09:50,040
You were like an unaccredited producer.
That's.

234
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,740
I mean it would have never worked the 
way it works without you.

235
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,400
Well,
I guess I guess it's.

236
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,510
I'll say it's a generous over

237
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,520
overstatement.
I don't think it is.

238
00:09:58,521 --> 00:10:00,680
I really don't.
You went over every scene.

239
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:05,710
You didn't just rehearse the scene.
You went over every scene and you went 

240
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,880
over with the beats and you came up with
alternatives.

241
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,650
Every single time,
I mean,

242
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:12,200
I don't think we ever,
unless the scene was absolutely perfect.

243
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:15,380
I don't think there was ever a time 
where we didn't dabble with things.

244
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,470
Yeah,
I know we all.

245
00:10:16,471 --> 00:10:18,240
And again,
I guess everyone does.

246
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:19,720
I mean a lot of it was.
I mean,

247
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,240
a lot of the cast you had,
you,

248
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:26,250
you know,
you and me and Phil and Andy were all 

249
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:26,360
used to creating their own stuff.
Right.

250
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:27,360
You know,
so we,

251
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:32,361
I think everyone came into it with that,
the ability to think on their feet and 

252
00:10:32,361 --> 00:10:32,361
change stuff.

253
00:10:32,361 --> 00:10:34,770
It was amazing that Paul Lettuce as much
as he did.

254
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,910
Yeah.
Know He,

255
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
he,
Paul Simms who was a producer of road 

256
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,591
who also worked on the Larry Sanders 
show before that was a really young guy 

257
00:10:42,591 --> 00:10:44,690
at the time and just really bright and 
really great writer,

258
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:49,740
great writer,
and just knew that we could fuck around 

259
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,380
and make different things up.
And you know,

260
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,380
when you're actually on the set and 
you're acting it out,

261
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:55,560
sometimes it doesn't come off as the 
same as it is on a written page.

262
00:10:55,561 --> 00:10:58,860
And sometimes there's an obvious or not 
so obvious alternative,

263
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:00,520
but it's just amazing that he let us do 
it.

264
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:01,270
Yeah.
Well they.

265
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:01,880
Because we,
yeah,

266
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,110
we,
we read rework,

267
00:11:03,111 --> 00:11:08,111
Steph turn rehearsals and find different
things we thought were funnier and then 

268
00:11:08,111 --> 00:11:11,651
we'd just run it for.
We'd run it for Paul and the other 

269
00:11:11,651 --> 00:11:11,651
writers at the end of the day.
And if they liked it,

270
00:11:11,651 --> 00:11:12,170
it would show up in the script the next 
day.

271
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:17,540
It seemed like both of your characters 
were pretty much really well written for

272
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:22,541
you guys because like you to at least I 
didn't feel and didn't really seem like 

273
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:22,541
that,
you know,

274
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:23,900
in real life I would imagine.
But it seemed like you were,

275
00:11:23,901 --> 00:11:26,450
you and you are you in on that show,
which sort of.

276
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:31,500
I mean,
Dave was more innocent and I was more 

277
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,210
retarded.
But you had your theories and stuff like

278
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,960
that have incorporated aspects of our 
personalities.

279
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:36,860
Yeah,
definitely.

280
00:11:36,861 --> 00:11:37,670
I mean,
um,

281
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,720
I mean I was.
Dave Nelson is probably a real mix of me

282
00:11:41,721 --> 00:11:45,490
and fill and fail me and Paul Simms,
you know,

283
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,220
so it'd be depending on who the rightest
felt like mocking more that day.

284
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,280
Yeah.
Yeah.

285
00:11:52,281 --> 00:11:54,010
I was a just a more retarded

286
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,910
version of me with special gifts that I 
don't possess.

287
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,940
Yes.
Yeah.

288
00:11:57,941 --> 00:11:58,690
You were.
Yeah.

289
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,140
You were a conspiracy theorist with a 
bit of the fonts.

290
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:05,800
Yeah.
It was a fun gig though.

291
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,970
A lot of fun.
The last year was oddest.

292
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,810
Fuck.
Yeah.

293
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:13,980
But other than that it was a,
it was a lot of fun and I'm glad we did 

294
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,670
the last year because I would've hated 
to not see everyone after.

295
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,080
That would've been terrible.
Yeah.

296
00:12:17,081 --> 00:12:19,600
I always assumed we would be hanging out
all the time from now on,

297
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,730
from,
from that point on,

298
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,810
but it really didn't work out that way.
No,

299
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,640
no.
It never does,

300
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,450
you know?
No,

301
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,360
it's true because everybody goes in such
different directions.

302
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,730
I ran into Maura once or twice,
I know a wrench,

303
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:36,750
but once we had a good time at one of 
those NBC functions and I was on news 

304
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,460
radio or fear factor and she was on er 
and we got drunk together.

305
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:44,460
It was a great time.
It was like the old days reminded me is 

306
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:44,820
always fun to get drunk.
Oh yeah.

307
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,810
She's one of the best ever.
You know.

308
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,360
She was the one who convinced me to kick
in the craft service door.

309
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,250
All hungry.
Uh,

310
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:57,680
yeah,
we had some good times and that set 

311
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,280
after the set,
after filming we would basically just 

312
00:12:59,280 --> 00:12:59,280
drink all night,
you know,

313
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:04,050
filming would be done at whatever and we
all have our mini fridge is stocked in 

314
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:08,290
our coolers and we were just getting 
hammered and just shoot the shit and 

315
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,630
have fun and laugh and go over to Dave's
ruined listed some weird music.

316
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,300
Dave voice had some weird chicks that 
made you want to cry.

317
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:19,140
Playing in a few of them lead dated,
you know,

318
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:22,060
strange,
somber women's voices,

319
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,470
[inaudible] and uh,
and then we,

320
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:25,570
yeah,
somebody you'd be there till,

321
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,870
till it was time to go to denny's,
right.

322
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:33,060
Or we would go to a,
down the street when we were at sunset 

323
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:33,060
gower,
we,

324
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:33,550
we'd go down to that bar.
What was it called?

325
00:13:33,551 --> 00:13:35,680
There was like a,
like an industry bar,

326
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,870
like really catered to people that were 
leaving the set.

327
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:41,350
Oh,
well the mold right next to the peanut.

328
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,430
Was that what it was?
Yeah,

329
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,640
it was to be the Columbia bar and grill.
Yeah,

330
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,400
yeah,
yeah,

331
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:50,670
yeah.
It'd be like other people from Fraser 

332
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:53,360
and uh,
that was weird to be there and would go 

333
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,641
and it wouldn't be stiff as fuck.
We would be hammered and they would be 

334
00:13:56,641 --> 00:13:57,130
all still like doing their actor thing,
you know?

335
00:13:57,131 --> 00:13:58,660
I thought it was a marvelous 
performance.

336
00:13:58,661 --> 00:14:01,030
I think he was quite lovely.
Did you know that?

337
00:14:01,031 --> 00:14:03,120
It's on Broadway now.
I'll be amazing.

338
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,510
I've got to see it.
You know,

339
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:09,511
they were just all completely full of 
shit and he would come and try and grab 

340
00:14:09,511 --> 00:14:09,511
everybody's Dick.

341
00:14:09,511 --> 00:14:12,310
And Dave and I will be hammered more 
yammered yeah.

342
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,400
And Julie being extremely been.
Yeah,

343
00:14:15,401 --> 00:14:17,890
we'd all be laughing and joking around.
Yeah.

344
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,670
It was a great,
great group of humans the most.

345
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:22,030
That was one of the most fun times of my
entire life.

346
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,560
Those,
those years.

347
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:28,590
It was amazing.
There was one time I remember we were 

348
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,361
about to go and do it.
There was a live audience there and 

349
00:14:30,361 --> 00:14:32,711
everybody was getting ready,
getting ready and we were standing in 

350
00:14:32,711 --> 00:14:32,711
that little back hallway where they 
would introduce us and,

351
00:14:32,711 --> 00:14:33,700
and I said,
you know,

352
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,530
that this is going to be one of those 
days.

353
00:14:35,531 --> 00:14:37,540
We're going to look back,
uh,

354
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:42,930
when we're older and we're going to go,
I can't believe I didn't enjoy this 

355
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:42,930
more.
I can't believe.

356
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,560
I didn't appreciate how crazy.
This is more.

357
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:50,650
You don't realize what a random stroke 
of luck it is to get so cool people 

358
00:14:51,951 --> 00:14:52,480
altogether

359
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,750
in one group.
Yeah.

360
00:14:53,751 --> 00:14:54,270
The fact that,

361
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,050
yeah,
we all wanted to spend time together,

362
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:57,870
uh,
like,

363
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,530
like when work was done,
nobody can go.

364
00:15:00,531 --> 00:15:01,520
Everyone wanted to stay.

365
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,730
We all had fun.
We,

366
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,330
it was a,
it was a really weird environment.

367
00:15:05,331 --> 00:15:07,460
It was a weird environment to in 
creatively.

368
00:15:07,461 --> 00:15:10,220
It's just,
it's so rare that a sitcom works.

369
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:10,940
Yeah.
You know,

370
00:15:10,941 --> 00:15:15,941
I've,
I've been given scripts to sitcoms and 

371
00:15:15,941 --> 00:15:15,941
fuck,
I couldn't get into them.

372
00:15:15,941 --> 00:15:18,230
I fucked up in some recent audition,
but a year ago I guess it was,

373
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,560
I just,
I didn't even read it a little bit and 

374
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,781
then I looked at him like,
what the fuck am I going to do with 

375
00:15:25,781 --> 00:15:25,781
this?
And then it's just,

376
00:15:25,781 --> 00:15:25,781
yeah,
you just,

377
00:15:25,781 --> 00:15:25,781
you,
you feel like,

378
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:28,430
like you were there when lightening hit 
the ground,

379
00:15:28,431 --> 00:15:29,540
you know,
you don't want to be,

380
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,150
you don't wanna you know.

381
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:32,630
Well,
was that,

382
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:36,190
it was like we were uh,
from the very first time I think we were

383
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:39,610
all together on state.
It felt like we'd been there for years.

384
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,390
Like it felt like a group of people who 
have been working together for,

385
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:43,900
for a long time.

386
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,600
It was so weird.
It was such a weird environment.

387
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:49,090
Such a weird experience for me because 
like I said,

388
00:15:49,091 --> 00:15:52,360
I had no acting experience nor 
aspirations to act.

389
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:57,740
It was strictly a by greed alone that I 
wound up in Hollywood because they 

390
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,230
offered me all this money to be in a 
sitcom and I was like,

391
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,400
what the fuck?
Really?

392
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,010
Then all of a sudden I'm here and then 
literally less than,

393
00:16:03,011 --> 00:16:05,230
you know,
six months after that show was canceled.

394
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:07,030
I'm on news radio.
Yeah,

395
00:16:07,031 --> 00:16:08,190
it was,
it was so bizarre.

396
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:13,191
And it,
you kind of have the same kind of like 

397
00:16:13,191 --> 00:16:13,191
thrown into it when you were young when 
you started kids in the hall.

398
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:18,480
I was 28 while I was,
I was 19 when I started working with 

399
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,940
Kevin Mcdonald Flower,
but I was 26.

400
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,700
I was 25.
And the series started.

401
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:26,210
And were you a comic before or were you 
doing and kind of Improv as well?

402
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,180
I started,
I quit high school and started

403
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,670
doing standup when I was like 17.
Wow.

404
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,440
Uh,
and then how long did you do it for?

405
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:36,640
Just for like just let even two years.
About a year and a half.

406
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:39,910
I had quit when I was just around my 
19th birthday.

407
00:16:39,911 --> 00:16:42,340
And that is exactly when you were 
getting into kids in the hall.

408
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:47,400
Yeah.
I quit after I met Kevin Mcdonald and 

409
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:47,400
started doing stuff with him.
I stopped doing standup.

410
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,260
So just focused all your time on 
sketches and stuff like that.

411
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:51,640
Yeah,
we're doing a joint is improv group.

412
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:57,090
Um,
and then we're like both theater sports 

413
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:59,150
and it was taken like second city 
workshops and you know,

414
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:03,040
and that led pretty I guess fairly 
quickly within a few years to the,

415
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:08,041
uh,
the whole five men version of the kids 

416
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:08,890
in the hall that became the TV show,

417
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:14,440
which they played nonstop in the United 
States on comedy central all the time 

418
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,550
back in the day.
And I remember.

419
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,340
Yeah,
I think we were all they had for awhile.

420
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,470
Yeah.
That weekend at Bernie's.

421
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,800
That was a pretty south park.
Yeah.

422
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,300
Oh yeah.
Wrap your head around that.

423
00:17:23,301 --> 00:17:25,050
Yeah.
How many Central Pre south park?

424
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,630
We were pre comedy central.
I think we were back then there was,

425
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,120
there was the [inaudible] network and 
the comedy network.

426
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,160
The Jurassic era.
Yeah.

427
00:17:32,161 --> 00:17:35,430
And then they became comedy central.
Yeah.

428
00:17:35,431 --> 00:17:37,590
My first deal with them was on the 
comedy channel.

429
00:17:37,591 --> 00:17:40,900
They these little profiles of Comedians 
and they would have you do like.

430
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:44,880
It's where I met Sharon Levy,
who's the head of spike.

431
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:49,910
She's one of the heads of programming.
It's she was a pa and we were in a field

432
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,610
that was on a farm for handicapped 
animals,

433
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:58,650
like literally animals that were like,
it's hard to laugh at Handicap van.

434
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,300
Yeah,
you can laugh.

435
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,660
It doesn't matter.
You're going to eat them.

436
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,180
They die,
but it was like,

437
00:18:03,181 --> 00:18:05,070
you know,
like blind sheep and you know,

438
00:18:05,071 --> 00:18:09,270
a cow with a limp and and we were and 
she was holding the microphone and I was

439
00:18:09,271 --> 00:18:10,890
doing like,
stand up to these animals.

440
00:18:10,891 --> 00:18:13,380
That was like a campaign program that 
they put together.

441
00:18:13,381 --> 00:18:14,940
Yeah,
the comedy channel.

442
00:18:14,941 --> 00:18:16,070
It was.
God,

443
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:21,120
it's so funny.
Hair fucking flies by and that's 

444
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,340
history.
Remember Allen Show?

445
00:18:21,341 --> 00:18:22,830
Yeah.
Alan havey used to.

446
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:26,460
He would be at pnl every now and then or
whatever the bar was called.

447
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:27,840
We rent.
Yeah,

448
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:28,310
yeah.
He was.

449
00:18:28,311 --> 00:18:30,360
Yeah.
He was doing some show that was nearby.

450
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,960
That was the other thing you'd be like 
close by and you would also get the 

451
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:35,960
feeds from other,
other,

452
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,080
um.

453
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,610
Oh yeah.
The other shows and other sets we get to

454
00:18:38,611 --> 00:18:43,611
watch other horrible sitcoms.
Greg Geraldo had had a show that was a 

455
00:18:43,611 --> 00:18:43,611
good one actually.
A lot.

456
00:18:43,611 --> 00:18:45,090
Yeah.
And so did Joey Lawrence.

457
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:46,340
Do you remember that?
Oh,

458
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:51,530
I mostly remember him sitting in his 
convertible playing his own cds really 

459
00:18:51,901 --> 00:18:54,300
loud.
He always had bad ass cars.

460
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:59,301
Like Joey Lawrence always had like the 
newest Ferrari or the newest Bentley or 

461
00:18:59,301 --> 00:19:00,930
whatever the hell it was.
But he'd sit there playing his own music

462
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,330
loud.
Super loud with a Bandanna on.

463
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,730
Okay.
Where is he now?

464
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,450
Man,
you intentionally ripped jeans.

465
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,280
He was just in dancing with the stars 
recently.

466
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,990
Well,
I think Dave said it best.

467
00:19:09,991 --> 00:19:14,991
Even back then was someone needs to tell
that young man that he's gay and that's 

468
00:19:15,151 --> 00:19:20,151
exactly how you said until we stopped 
and we were looking there and there was 

469
00:19:20,151 --> 00:19:20,800
a couple of them in you.

470
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:25,840
You just,
you just stopped and paused and said 

471
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:25,840
someone needs to tell that young man,
he's gay.

472
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,650
We went into work,
I mean he would be right,

473
00:19:28,651 --> 00:19:33,651
you don't know where these,
where these cars were parked and right 

474
00:19:33,651 --> 00:19:36,170
directly in front of the building.
So you'd open up the door and basically 

475
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:39,801
be on the set and right behind that is 
this fucking guy in his car blaring his 

476
00:19:39,801 --> 00:19:41,730
own music from some insane stereo 
system.

477
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,250
And if your music is,
the is great,

478
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,490
it's wrong to sit there and listen to 
your own music in the car.

479
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,200
Yeah.
Robert Plant is in his car.

480
00:19:49,201 --> 00:19:52,020
Fucking beating the drums to his 
steering wheel.

481
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,400
Still be like,
what the fuck?

482
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,390
Really?
Yeah.

483
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,410
You don't get enough attention,
but when you're Joey Lawrence,

484
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,290
how did you get hooked up with the South
Park guys?

485
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,630
Weren't you the Baldwin Brothers on the 
South Park movie?

486
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,590
I was,
I met.

487
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,420
Well I met Matt and Trey,
um,

488
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,650
before there's,
before South Park went on the air,

489
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:11,760
uh,
I met,

490
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:16,850
they'd done there,
that little Christmas thing that was 

491
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:16,850
going around,
right?

492
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:20,100
Barton Botox before I bought Bronto and,
and uh,

493
00:20:20,101 --> 00:20:21,750
and Jesus,
which was amazing.

494
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:27,080
And uh,
and then so I had seen that and then 

495
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,700
they got their deal with,
with comedy central comedy central party

496
00:20:29,701 --> 00:20:32,880
somewhere in like a,
one of the good parties,

497
00:20:32,881 --> 00:20:34,340
like the rave parties or.
No,

498
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:36,900
it was pretty quiet.
There wasn't a small bar.

499
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:39,000
It was like a tiny.
But they were there.

500
00:20:39,001 --> 00:20:43,980
I remember because I remember a tray was
a wearing a shiny silver.

501
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,030
A jumpsuit serve a,
a jumpsuit.

502
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,540
Yeah.
It was like really shiny,

503
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,130
you know,
it was like Super Dave.

504
00:20:51,131 --> 00:20:53,170
But in silver,
um,

505
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,930
I fucking love those guys.
I love that they exist,

506
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:58,630
you know,
that there's these guys that are just so

507
00:20:58,631 --> 00:21:00,970
balls out there and shit.
They do.

508
00:21:00,971 --> 00:21:03,580
She's so crazy.
And when I say bigger,

509
00:21:03,581 --> 00:21:04,380
longer,
uncut,

510
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,440
I like because at the time I got,
I don't know what the fuck a South Park 

511
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:09,440
movie is,
I don't know how,

512
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:12,490
how they're going to do this.
And then I go into the premier and all I

513
00:21:12,491 --> 00:21:15,850
could think of was this is the most punk
rock thing I've ever seen in my life.

514
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:19,540
This is the most aggressive.
That thing I is the line.

515
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:20,840
I shit on your God.

516
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:28,480
It's amazing that they got away with it 
when they had Saddam Hussein and the 

517
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,580
devil and that whole thing.
Penis when they first cost.

518
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:37,590
Remember when you first heard like 
heartening say fuck or something like 

519
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:37,590
that.
You're like,

520
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,350
whoa.
That was huge.

521
00:21:38,351 --> 00:21:40,630
And then they.
They took it with team America,

522
00:21:40,631 --> 00:21:42,490
world police.
He took them in another direction,

523
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:47,520
which is fucking incredible.
Another one of my favorite all time 

524
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:47,520
movies.
It's hilarious.

525
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,631
I mean they're just the funniest damn 
movie for whatever weird reason doesn't 

526
00:21:51,631 --> 00:21:53,890
make me laugh the second and third time.
I don't know.

527
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,200
American America.
Yeah.

528
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,300
I watched it the other day and it's 
fucking.

529
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,050
Maybe I'm.
Maybe I'm watching alone.

530
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,780
Maybe I need to watch with friends.
The first time I watched it I thought it

531
00:22:01,781 --> 00:22:04,960
was the funniest thing I've ever seen in
my life by a long shot.

532
00:22:04,961 --> 00:22:08,440
Like I love the scene where the guy 
throws up all over himself and throw up.

533
00:22:08,441 --> 00:22:10,860
Just won't stop and it goes on forever.
I was like,

534
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:13,450
these guys are animals.
Like they don't fuck around.

535
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:15,510
They go so deep.
Yeah.

536
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:20,610
Well,
that was the scene in the car is going 

537
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:20,610
well first you're going to have to blow 
me.

538
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:20,980
Just kidding.
No,

539
00:22:20,981 --> 00:22:22,730
I'm serious.
You're really to have to blow.

540
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,280
Did you ever see the uncut version with 
the ticket?

541
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:31,290
Shit.
The girl takes a shit on his chest and 

542
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:33,010
his face crazy sex scene with.
Oh No,

543
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:36,250
I never studied cut version.
She shits of his chest.

544
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,970
Sensors will like enough already about 
censorship.

545
00:22:42,971 --> 00:22:43,450
It was,
yeah,

546
00:22:43,451 --> 00:22:44,320
it was just that.
It's just.

547
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,160
Oh,
come on.

548
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,770
Well,
I think it's also they're very savvy and

549
00:22:47,771 --> 00:22:52,771
they understand the system that you have
to put so many things in order to get 

550
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:56,341
what you actually want so they feel it.
So the sensors feel like they've done 

551
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:57,280
their job.
There was an episode of News Radio about

552
00:22:57,281 --> 00:22:59,980
the word penis and because of this 
episode,

553
00:22:59,981 --> 00:23:04,981
this episode had like 30 uses of the 
word penis in and they wouldn't air it 

554
00:23:04,981 --> 00:23:09,450
one season and we had to wait until the 
subsequent season before they started 

555
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:09,450
airing.
Yet you remember that?

556
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:10,750
I forget.
And then,

557
00:23:10,751 --> 00:23:13,420
yeah.
And then there was still a negotiation.

558
00:23:13,421 --> 00:23:16,030
They had wanted the number of penises 
removed.

559
00:23:16,031 --> 00:23:21,031
Yeah,
and the premise of the story was bill 

560
00:23:21,031 --> 00:23:24,811
saying that you have to say a bunch of 
penises in order to be able to say one 

561
00:23:24,811 --> 00:23:26,320
or two compliment.
They literally,

562
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:31,090
they're like letting everyone in on the 
Google and these fuckers still do it.

563
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,870
You know,
these network people are still there.

564
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,380
You're saying it too many times.
Yeah.

565
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:37,810
If you can say penis once,
why can't you say it a thousand times?

566
00:23:37,811 --> 00:23:39,820
What the fuck is the difference?
If it's relevant,

567
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:44,920
if it's not like what are you trying to 
pull off by saying it over and over 

568
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:44,920
again.
Let's see.

569
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,140
I have bronchitis,
I will.

570
00:23:45,141 --> 00:23:46,400
You have children.
I have children.

571
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:48,980
And when my daughter will say,
well why is it,

572
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:52,070
why is it okay to say poor but not shit?
Right.

573
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:55,280
And my only answer is because most of 
the people in the world are stupid,

574
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:55,740
but

575
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:02,330
there's no other explanation for it.
They mean the same thing,

576
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,150
you know?
And so I say like,

577
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,240
you know,
language,

578
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,130
you know,
all words are supposed to do is convey a

579
00:24:07,131 --> 00:24:09,530
meaning and if the meaning is the same,
the words are the same.

580
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,570
Exactly.
You know,

581
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:15,780
we have a rear really weird thing in 
this culture in this country and this 

582
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,960
culture where we're sensitive to secret 
words,

583
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,300
you know,
secret special words were very sensitive

584
00:24:19,301 --> 00:24:22,570
to them,
whether it's faggot or nigger or,

585
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:27,610
or shit or it's all should.
There should be no magical words that 

586
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:31,770
have super power for good or bad.
Yeah.

587
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,670
And then the,
the fuck word,

588
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,260
which is like this sort of like sort of 
acceptable,

589
00:24:36,261 --> 00:24:39,400
like not even that bad anymore and 
casual conversation,

590
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,090
uh,
you know,

591
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:43,360
all this fucking guy or you know,
as long as you don't use it too much,

592
00:24:43,361 --> 00:24:46,510
people don't really seem to care as 
businessmen will say it in meetings,

593
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,100
absolutely.
Sure.

594
00:24:48,101 --> 00:24:49,060
But children.

595
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:54,930
Yeah.
But we still send them to school and 

596
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:54,930
tell them,

597
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:57,660
pretend this still exists.
There was that these words are bad.

598
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:00,990
There was a photo that I talked about on
the podcast the other day.

599
00:25:00,991 --> 00:25:03,030
I've been talking about this on stage 
because it's so ridiculous.

600
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:07,410
It was a Mexican drug killing.
Chop this guy up into a bunch of pieces,

601
00:25:07,411 --> 00:25:12,411
skinned him,
took his skin off of his face like a 

602
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:12,411
mask,
hung it on a stick.

603
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:15,750
All of this is on the air and then they 
cut his hands off inside.

604
00:25:15,751 --> 00:25:19,230
One of his hands was his dick and his 
balls and it was blurred out.

605
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,490
Yeah,
see that.

606
00:25:20,491 --> 00:25:22,860
All I can think is that,
and people say Mexicans are lazy.

607
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:29,080
That's a lot of work.
You won't see a white killer taking the 

608
00:25:29,511 --> 00:25:30,920
time.
True.

609
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:36,160
He said that he sent a very clear 
message and so did the owners of the 

610
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:36,880
website.
That balls are scary,

611
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:42,510
scary.
Not Skin skulls and hands,

612
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,900
you know,
it's the same thing.

613
00:25:44,901 --> 00:25:46,510
It's like,
what is wrong with us?

614
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:48,290
Why?
Why do we look at things that way?

615
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,970
Like the other day,
my daughter,

616
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,520
she's taken to saying shit when things 
don't go well,

617
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,800
which was what happens when she hears 
it,

618
00:25:54,801 --> 00:25:56,930
you know,
they'll imitate their atmosphere.

619
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,310
My wife was horrified.
She was like,

620
00:25:58,311 --> 00:25:59,920
if we stopped now,
she'll stop too.

621
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,550
And I'm like,
and then what?

622
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:06,750
It's just taking a break,
just taking a break for 10 years and 

623
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:06,750
she's gonna start saying shit again.
Like everybody else.

624
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:07,880
Like why can't you say it's cute as 
hell,

625
00:26:07,881 --> 00:26:08,150
man,

626
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:13,660
I just told my daughter just just don't 
do it at school because there's no 

627
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:16,840
reason.
And I keep saying it's not like there's 

628
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,550
any reason for you not to do it.
It's cool other than the fact that 

629
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:18,550
you'll get grief from people.

630
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:23,150
It's truly amazing that we grew up 
knowing they were silly and now we're 

631
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,990
adults and still silly and we're 
teaching children and they're going to.

632
00:26:24,991 --> 00:26:28,920
It's like this meme takes forever to get
out of our system.

633
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:31,740
This forbidden word meme now.
Like what?

634
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:35,370
Why is it still here?
While it's absolutely ridiculous,

635
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:39,120
we could eliminate so much and still 
convey the exact same thoughts.

636
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:44,360
If we had no bad words that you could 
have come on television and everyone 

637
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,720
will just get used to it and it would be
fine.

638
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,240
It wouldn't change the world,
you know?

639
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,860
It wouldn't.
It would make people angry,

640
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,980
wouldn't cause crime across the border 
into the United States.

641
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:57,390
I think they will confiscate the word 
come from your lexicon if you read it in

642
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:59,370
order to.
You have to have three different pages,

643
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:04,380
right sir?
Are you carrying the word continue your 

644
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:08,721
brain now you're,
you've just started to do standup 

645
00:27:08,721 --> 00:27:11,210
recently of a fascinating thing to me 
because I always thought you'd be a 

646
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:15,651
brilliant standup because you're a great
writer and when we used to do those 

647
00:27:15,651 --> 00:27:15,651
little things in the audience,
you remember wearing,

648
00:27:15,651 --> 00:27:18,120
um,
we would talk to the audience before you

649
00:27:18,121 --> 00:27:21,090
would fuck around with them every now 
and then and you wouldn't like do it.

650
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:22,670
Like Phil had a routine that he was 
doing,

651
00:27:22,671 --> 00:27:27,671
like Phil actually started doing standup
because of wanting to entertain the 

652
00:27:27,671 --> 00:27:32,091
audience.
So he had a bunch of bits that he would 

653
00:27:32,091 --> 00:27:32,091
do like Clinton impressions and they 
were really good and it was like,

654
00:27:32,091 --> 00:27:33,060
I'm just like,
Holy Shit Dude.

655
00:27:33,061 --> 00:27:34,110
You know,
like a real comic.

656
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:37,380
Like you're a standup is like kind of 
thinking about to get up there.

657
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,800
Phil was like this really unusual human 
being.

658
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:42,570
Very,
very fascinating guy.

659
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,470
You know,
he was the world.

660
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,800
He was a great hobbyist.
Yeah,

661
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:50,730
he would go so deep he,
he got into flying and which is actually

662
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,740
how I found out about this neighborhood,
you know,

663
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:57,750
Phil was taking me out into the valley 
looking for different places where he 

664
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:01,821
could go and have a nice view and we 
went up in this little single engine 

665
00:28:01,821 --> 00:28:05,631
plane,
but I remember when he first started 

666
00:28:05,631 --> 00:28:07,461
getting into the flying boy,
he was reading book after book in 

667
00:28:07,461 --> 00:28:07,950
between rehearsals.

668
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:12,950
He'd be studying his pilots book.
Like that was the little fake broadcast 

669
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:13,080
booth.
Very.

670
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:15,000
He was very,
very disciplined.

671
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,440
He would say Phil was like a big league 
version of Mark Mckinney from kids in 

672
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,070
the hall.
It was really into his flight simulator.

673
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:27,120
Phil learned to fly a plane.
He loved it.

674
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,610
He learned to fly a plane.
He learned to sail a boat.

675
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,070
He was one of those guys,
you know,

676
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,000
he's only had learned to duck.
Yeah,

677
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:39,030
my will not even if you learn to just 
separate from fucking crazy people I 

678
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:39,930
know had some.
We,

679
00:28:39,931 --> 00:28:40,980
you know,
we all did,

680
00:28:40,981 --> 00:28:44,070
I think had talks with him many times 
about divorce.

681
00:28:44,071 --> 00:28:45,750
You know,
like you gotta get Outta that man.

682
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:50,850
Yeah.
It was one of those things where we 

683
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:50,850
would,
uh,

684
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:53,000
we would have these parties.
I mean Paul had one party wants and I 

685
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,701
remember we were all at this bar 
somewhere and Phil showed up with the 

686
00:28:55,701 --> 00:29:00,021
wife and she was saying the creepiest 
shit and insulting him and talking about

687
00:29:01,441 --> 00:29:03,810
how she likes pickup trucks because they
reminder of,

688
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,240
you know,
boys that she used to bang back when she

689
00:29:06,241 --> 00:29:07,590
was younger and just,
just,

690
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,120
just torturing him.

691
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,040
Just torture.
I'm talking about,

692
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:12,270
oh well you're not fail.
You know,

693
00:29:12,271 --> 00:29:14,010
it feels too old.
And he just didn't.

694
00:29:14,011 --> 00:29:15,900
He have like women thrown on him all the
time.

695
00:29:15,901 --> 00:29:18,600
It seems like if he was that miserable 
that you would have just.

696
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:23,670
Doesn't matter man,
when you have children with somebody 

697
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:24,180
inexorably attached for bill was.
Yeah.

698
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:26,310
The thought of being separated from his 
kids,

699
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:29,670
which I understand because at the time I
was separated from my kids.

700
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,880
Yeah.
Yeah.

701
00:29:30,881 --> 00:29:35,881
I know.
I completely see where he was coming 

702
00:29:35,881 --> 00:29:35,881
from.
He didn't want a divorce.

703
00:29:35,881 --> 00:29:36,420
He thought his wife is with all her 
flaws,

704
00:29:36,421 --> 00:29:38,760
was still very good to the kids and you 
know,

705
00:29:38,761 --> 00:29:43,761
and he felt,
felt like he could work it out and then 

706
00:29:43,761 --> 00:29:43,761
he really got into pot,

707
00:29:43,761 --> 00:29:43,761
you know,
that was his thing.

708
00:29:43,761 --> 00:29:45,030
He would just get these later.
Yeah.

709
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:50,700
Yeah.
You sitting in his Mercedes in the 

710
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,410
parking space with his one hitter to the
gills stone and you weren't smoking weed

711
00:29:52,931 --> 00:29:57,931
at the time.
He imagined smoking weed with Phil 

712
00:29:57,931 --> 00:29:57,931
Hartman.
That would barely use.

713
00:29:57,931 --> 00:29:57,931
Yeah.
Yeah.

714
00:29:57,931 --> 00:29:59,080
He didn't do any drugs.
I would just get drunk.

715
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,580
So I would do.
Yeah.

716
00:30:00,581 --> 00:30:01,090
I was,
uh,

717
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:01,790
this is,
uh,

718
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:03,220
my,
my old thinking.

719
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:07,090
I had a lot of thinking leftover from my
martial arts competition days.

720
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:12,420
It came to drugs.
Pot was one of the worst for motivation.

721
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:17,620
I was like,
the last thing I wanted in life was to 

722
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,041
be a loser.
The last thing I wanted to be with 

723
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:20,041
someone who just couldn't get their shit
together was lazy.

724
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:22,900
And I knew so many people that were like
that.

725
00:30:22,901 --> 00:30:26,590
With marijuana is I'd always associated 
it with losers.

726
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,810
Wasn't needed.
Your focus dealt a little.

727
00:30:28,811 --> 00:30:31,270
I did.
You help them to honestly,

728
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:35,230
marijuana is here to calm the savage 
instincts of man,

729
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,610
you know,
especially certain men,

730
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,110
you know,
it's very good to me.

731
00:30:38,111 --> 00:30:41,290
It's the best self medication I've ever 
found.

732
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:43,780
I guess that's why me,
it just turns me into a sponge.

733
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,200
Extra.
Relax.

734
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:52,320
We were talking about this before the 
show that you really should try it when 

735
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:52,320
you write,
you know,

736
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:52,320
Shit I haven't.
Like,

737
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:52,320
I'm.
Yeah.

738
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,890
I don't think I've ever written high.
I've written a lot drunk.

739
00:30:56,230 --> 00:31:01,230
That's great to know.
But drunk on an airplane riding is 

740
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:01,230
fantastic.
Yeah.

741
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,080
Just stuck in that seat.
Can't go anywhere and yeah,

742
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:03,810
the,
the,

743
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:05,500
the idea is just come.
Yeah.

744
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:08,170
The sensor shuts down when you're.
When you're drunk.

745
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,010
Yeah.
Yeah.

746
00:31:09,011 --> 00:31:09,670
Oh yeah,
yeah.

747
00:31:09,671 --> 00:31:10,240
Of course.
Man.

748
00:31:10,241 --> 00:31:13,590
That's why so many great writers are 
drunks from Hemingway,

749
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:14,520
a hunter,
s Thompson.

750
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:19,520
I mean,
so many of them just wanted to escape 

751
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:19,520
or,
or get to it,

752
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,030
escape from themselves and get to 
whatever the ideas were,

753
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,160
whatever they were like drink.
It gives you that,

754
00:31:23,161 --> 00:31:27,460
that window where you don't hate 
yourself long enough before the,

755
00:31:27,461 --> 00:31:29,470
before the depression of the drinking 
sets in,

756
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:32,410
but that moment where you think I'm 
really into and I'm beautiful.

757
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:35,070
Yeah.
And before the depression sets in,

758
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:40,120
that was always the,
the news radio set like you want to 

759
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,061
leave after three hours.
You didn't want to be there in the 

760
00:31:43,061 --> 00:31:44,340
fourth and fifth when all the Irish 
blood comes to the floor.

761
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:48,550
A lot of Irish.
There's so much that she.

762
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,790
Me and I'm Maura.
Oh yeah.

763
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,530
All of us.
Uh,

764
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,720
Maura was mad at me once for a whole 
year for something that happened when 

765
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,010
she was drunk.
Yeah.

766
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,090
She could hold a grudge,
you know,

767
00:32:01,091 --> 00:32:02,260
and she's so,
you know,

768
00:32:02,261 --> 00:32:04,770
you love or you don't want to make up 
sources like grudge hurts.

769
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:09,780
I know I sound more isomer briefly.
So the kids,

770
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:14,500
she was a shooting a pilot for her show,
a underneath my apartment.

771
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:15,880
That's what it's.
Oh really has.

772
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,460
Yeah.
Pete's cafe and I live above.

773
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,010
I shouldn't say that on the Internet.
Don't say fucking crazy fucks.

774
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:24,640
Yeah.
Girls were white.

775
00:32:24,641 --> 00:32:26,830
Makeup on and black lipstick will be 
waiting for you.

776
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:32,450
Yeah,
that's how I started shooting a short 

777
00:32:32,621 --> 00:32:35,560
hair.
Her hair was growing back in as a single

778
00:32:35,561 --> 00:32:36,250
woman though,
right?

779
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:37,440
Yes.
Yeah.

780
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,640
And she's still,
I don't know.

781
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,060
I don't,
don't know what I'm talking

782
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:44,420
to her in a lot of time.
If you're listening more pickup a phone,

783
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,380
come on boy.
Naked call follow me on twitter.

784
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:51,800
They had called my agent.
That's the easiest way.

785
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:53,510
I know you're,
I know you're legit.

786
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:55,760
You know how to get ahold of the people.
Um,

787
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,600
so,
uh,

788
00:32:56,630 --> 00:33:01,630
you and you were married at the time and
you were getting divorced while we were 

789
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:06,371
doing the show and it was one of the 
craziest things I've ever seen in my 

790
00:33:06,371 --> 00:33:08,960
life and not just to Phil Hartman 
divorced thing scared me,

791
00:33:08,961 --> 00:33:13,961
but dave thing scared me.
And one of the reasons why dave scenes 

792
00:33:13,961 --> 00:33:16,900
thing scared me was you do not want to 
get fucking married in Canada because 

793
00:33:17,241 --> 00:33:22,241
when you break up in Canada,
say you decide you want to get a 

794
00:33:22,241 --> 00:33:24,821
divorce,
you can't legally get divorced until 

795
00:33:24,821 --> 00:33:25,220
you're separate for a year,
right?

796
00:33:25,221 --> 00:33:26,510
That's correct.
I'm not sure,

797
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:28,610
I can't even remember.
I believe it was a year.

798
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:33,620
It's tattooed in my brain because I 
remember thinking how crazy this was 

799
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,840
that you were fucked.
And what was happening was his wife,

800
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:40,870
his first wife was at accenture 
character and she decided to start 

801
00:33:41,271 --> 00:33:44,780
taking the fucking world or a content on
the radio.

802
00:33:44,781 --> 00:33:46,210
I would have gone with that.
You know,

803
00:33:46,211 --> 00:33:51,211
you're a great guy and I want to say 
that while she's the mother of your 

804
00:33:51,211 --> 00:33:51,211
children.
So yeah,

805
00:33:51,211 --> 00:33:54,770
that doesn't excuse it.
That is not a get out of.

806
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,260
Get out of countries.
Take.

807
00:33:58,610 --> 00:33:59,170
Well,
uh,

808
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:04,240
she was very odd and uh,
the first season the guys were together 

809
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,720
and then I believe by the second season 
it was over.

810
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:06,710
Yeah,
yeah,

811
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,950
yeah.
We split up and so she started.

812
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:15,010
What she would do is spend all days 
money so dave would be working and she 

813
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:15,320
would spend all day.
It's money,

814
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:20,420
I mean by crazy expensive furniture fly 
all around the world all the time.

815
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,480
So whenever Dave wanted to see his kids,
he used to have to get fucking malaria 

816
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:25,480
shots.
Yeah.

817
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:29,621
Okay.
So one time we were at one of these NBC 

818
00:34:29,621 --> 00:34:31,961
things and Dave's fucked up on malaria 
medication and gin and tonics or 

819
00:34:31,961 --> 00:34:32,870
whatever the fuck you were drinking.
Yeah.

820
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,960
And you get like,
like crazy.

821
00:34:35,961 --> 00:34:38,900
I had to stop Dave from beating a guy 
up.

822
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:44,590
I had to step in between.
Do you remember the big guy with the 

823
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:46,520
long hair with the fucking dawn job,
Tony Tony carry it.

824
00:34:46,521 --> 00:34:49,730
Wasn't I really liked and wasn't that 
the guy had done anything wrong.

825
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,030
It was just the malaria medication.
You become a psychotic.

826
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,220
It's a very common uh,
effect.

827
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,590
Especially apparently when you mix it 
with alcohol.

828
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:58,420
Yeah.
Well,

829
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,800
and you.
And then you add to that,

830
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:02,790
having made two trips to Africa in a 
month.

831
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:05,800
Yes.
Africa and see his fucking kids,

832
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:09,640
like I had to fly to.
I had to fly to Morocco at Thanksgiving.

833
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,360
And so we have two weeks off.
So I floated,

834
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,640
flew to uh,
and this again.

835
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:16,060
And she,
when we first separated,

836
00:35:16,061 --> 00:35:21,061
she took the kids.
We said we'd like a summerset mom 

837
00:35:21,061 --> 00:35:21,061
divorce.
Whereas like I need to take the children

838
00:35:21,061 --> 00:35:24,730
to the continent and gather my thoughts.
So she traveled through Europe with,

839
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:27,510
you know,
a six month old baby and a two year,

840
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:30,370
two and a half year old for six months 
and then,

841
00:35:30,371 --> 00:35:34,120
so then Thanksgiving there and Morocco.
So I had to go meet him in Morocco.

842
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:39,390
So I get spent 10 days in Morocco,
then another 24 hours flying back and 

843
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:41,160
then two weeks later we get our 
Christmas break.

844
00:35:41,161 --> 00:35:45,360
So I have to fly to Zimbabwe and uh,
there was nothing you could've done,

845
00:35:45,361 --> 00:35:46,980
like taking your money and you're like,
Hey,

846
00:35:46,981 --> 00:35:48,800
I'm giving it to joe or something like 
that.

847
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:51,210
No,
it was like a old money.

848
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,170
Yeah,
no,

849
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:57,330
you have to.
You're responsible for taking care of 

850
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:57,330
their wellbeing at the time when I like,
when I made her get out

851
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:58,970
the therapy,
she's a,

852
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:04,050
like,
I forced her to get us to get into 

853
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:04,050
couples therapy because I was miserable.
Um,

854
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:06,120
and,
and so since we got this,

855
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,350
I said,
let's go to therapy.

856
00:36:07,351 --> 00:36:07,630
She said,
well,

857
00:36:07,631 --> 00:36:09,840
I've got to go first.
All right,

858
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:14,850
you can go see the therapist.
So she goes in and explains to the 

859
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:17,080
therapist that I'm an abusive husband,
uh,

860
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,050
you know,
and then she starts asked,

861
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:24,210
she asked me being physically abusive 
and then she starts like phoning my 

862
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:27,700
family and friends and saying that I'm 
physically abusive,

863
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,700
complete fabrications.
Right.

864
00:36:29,701 --> 00:36:32,670
So she's just creating a good friend of 
mine,

865
00:36:32,671 --> 00:36:34,320
Steve Hibbert,
when he heard this

866
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,560
said,
that's crazy.

867
00:36:35,561 --> 00:36:37,180
If,
if dave was abusive,

868
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,500
she would be dead.

869
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:43,350
No,
but no,

870
00:36:43,351 --> 00:36:43,940
but then I go into

871
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,680
therapy and the therapist goes,
you know,

872
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:48,290
who is prepared for this abusive husband
and to walk in.

873
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,660
And she goes and she explained to me 
later,

874
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:55,670
she said it was very weird because you 
walked in and you didn't match the 

875
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:57,040
description of you at all.
And she said when you walked in.

876
00:36:57,041 --> 00:36:58,460
Yeah.
And I saw you two together.

877
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:01,760
I immediately realized that if anyone in
this couple was abused,

878
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:02,840
it was,
it was,

879
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,100
it was me.

880
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:07,130
Did the therapist say this to her?
Uh,

881
00:37:07,131 --> 00:37:09,140
I don't know if she ever said it to her 
in therapy.

882
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:10,920
Did you have a one on one with the 
therapy?

883
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:12,670
I had one on one with her.
We both saw her

884
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:17,670
individually and together and then after
a six months of therapy,

885
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:19,110
uh,
my wife,

886
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,200
uh,
when I thought things were starting to 

887
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,091
get better because I was,
I was able to do things like go CD 

888
00:37:26,091 --> 00:37:26,560
shopping with Steve,
uh,

889
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:31,580
without getting,
without that being a huge fight when I 

890
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:31,580
got home,
you know,

891
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,140
you know,
so that was like,

892
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,170
oh,
I'm a little bit of freedom here.

893
00:37:34,171 --> 00:37:39,171
I can go out and hang out with,
hang out with my friends for a little 

894
00:37:39,171 --> 00:37:40,290
bit without there being a huge fight.
And uh,

895
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:44,880
but then she was diagnosed as having 
borderline personality disorder.

896
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:50,470
They're not exactly mean.
And why is it borderline personality 

897
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:50,470
disorder?
It's a misnomer.

898
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,840
Really don't like it.
They used to,

899
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:56,950
they used to think it was because it was
a condition that bordered on being 

900
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:57,450
psychotic.
Um,

901
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:00,020
and now it's the,
that's they know,

902
00:38:00,021 --> 00:38:02,780
that isn't the condition.
It's not anything to do with psychosis,

903
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,750
but the name has stuck.

904
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:10,990
The problem with my problem with the 
name is when you say borderline 

905
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:13,841
personality disorder,
do you have a fucking personality 

906
00:38:13,841 --> 00:38:13,841
disorder or not?
What is borderline?

907
00:38:13,841 --> 00:38:17,450
You're kind of weird because in fact,
borderline's,

908
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:22,510
a lot of therapists don't even treat 
them because they think they're just 

909
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,360
impossible to treat and that they're 
horrible people to deal with.

910
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,760
You know that they're incredibly 
dishonest.

911
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:28,910
The pathological liars.
How do you define it though?

912
00:38:28,911 --> 00:38:31,670
How can you define certain sets of 
mental illness?

913
00:38:31,671 --> 00:38:33,180
I mean,
do,

914
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:35,030
is it a judgment call?
There's like a,

915
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:36,340
was it the DSM?

916
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:41,340
Is that what it's called?
The diagnostic standards manual or 

917
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:43,120
something like that.
And it's got like a checklist and if you

918
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:45,040
score a certain number on the checklist,
they go,

919
00:38:45,041 --> 00:38:47,290
that's a diagnosis.
And I think,

920
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:52,291
uh,
she had like nine out of 10 on the 

921
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:56,611
checklist for borderline.
Was she always this way or did she 

922
00:38:56,611 --> 00:38:56,680
change?
She was always that way.

923
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,880
She was out.
Yeah,

924
00:38:57,881 --> 00:38:59,730
like basically as soon as we became a 
couple,

925
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,310
like before we're couple,
she was my,

926
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:03,420
um,
before she did,

927
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:05,980
she was my best friend's girlfriend.
Oh Shit.

928
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,200
You know,
it's Karma son.

929
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:08,410
Yeah,
that's what happened.

930
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,280
You know,
you got hooked up with Karma and so,

931
00:39:11,281 --> 00:39:13,050
so it was like one of those things where
like,

932
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,350
she break up with him first and then go 
out with you.

933
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:16,120
Are you going to.
Oh No.

934
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:17,530
It was like one of those things where I 
sort of said,

935
00:39:17,531 --> 00:39:22,531
look,
I know we should stop hanging out so 

936
00:39:22,531 --> 00:39:22,531
much because um,
you know,

937
00:39:22,531 --> 00:39:23,090
I was like feeling bad about it again.

938
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:28,110
I was like 20 years old and at that 
point kind of lonely and desperate and 

939
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:28,870
said,
look,

940
00:39:28,871 --> 00:39:31,470
I've got these feelings and we should 
stop hanging out together alone.

941
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:36,480
Really?
You actually said I have these feelings 

942
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:36,480
and we should stop hanging out.
Yeah,

943
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,490
you guys would do the very few.
Yeah.

944
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:40,720
And her,
her reaction to that was the uh,

945
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,700
she just showed me her tits and started 
kissing me.

946
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,110
So I was like,
oh,

947
00:39:44,111 --> 00:39:45,360
all right.
Oh,

948
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:47,440
I tried.
You did give it your best.

949
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:49,600
So,
um,

950
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,880
so what happens?
Then you go to the buddy and go,

951
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:54,830
hey bro,
fuck your girlfriend again.

952
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,500
Well,
I tried to cool it,

953
00:39:56,501 --> 00:40:01,501
tried to get out of it,
and I even was out of town for awhile 

954
00:40:01,501 --> 00:40:02,860
and tried to stay away from it.
But um,

955
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,360
you know,
he was probably like,

956
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:05,500
thank God,
thank God.

957
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:10,530
Yeah.
Well that's the thing is I didn't 

958
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:10,530
realize at the time because I've gone 
all right.

959
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:13,880
All right.
I thought things were okay with them 

960
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:13,930
and,
and uh,

961
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,250
you know,
it,

962
00:40:14,251 --> 00:40:16,090
it wasn't until she and I hooked up 
like,

963
00:40:16,091 --> 00:40:17,290
because again,
as soon as we hook,

964
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,180
because borderlines,
when they love you,

965
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,640
you're the most beautiful,
perfect thing in the world.

966
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,680
But then,
uh,

967
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:27,190
but then after that,
like if anything is wrong,

968
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,230
then you suddenly become the most evil,
dark,

969
00:40:29,231 --> 00:40:31,600
horrible thing in the world and they 
can't,

970
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:36,780
they can't see the two at the same time.
They can't see your flaws and your and 

971
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,560
your virtues.
Wow.

972
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:41,860
I think I've dated somebody.
Every girl you like,

973
00:40:41,861 --> 00:40:43,810
man,
I need to write this fucking guy.

974
00:40:43,811 --> 00:40:46,810
He didn't even know he just got out of 
relationship with a penthouse pet of the

975
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:47,150
year.
Oh,

976
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,360
real it.
It was wonderful for me.

977
00:40:49,361 --> 00:40:51,400
It was like I had my own soap opera 
going on,

978
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:53,960
but it was also just like this where,
where,

979
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:55,570
when Shit went down,
it was,

980
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,480
it was on or off,
it was no like shuts down.

981
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,640
Maybe we can work through that.
It was just,

982
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:03,120
that's one of the key signals of a 
borderline,

983
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:04,240
uh,
is that,

984
00:41:04,241 --> 00:41:09,241
that in the they say it's the inability 
to recognize the good and bad in the 

985
00:41:09,241 --> 00:41:09,610
same person.
You know,

986
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:12,340
you can shift from being the most evil 
person to the greatest person.

987
00:41:12,341 --> 00:41:13,740
I A hundred percent.
Yeah.

988
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:16,930
So with my first wife before we were a 
couple,

989
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:18,410
when it was just,
you know,

990
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,200
uh,
elicit,

991
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:22,450
you know,
when it was like this secret feelings,

992
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,320
uh,
you know,

993
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,340
a,
we were friends,

994
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:27,340
I was the greatest guy ever since she 
made me feel like I was the greatest guy

995
00:41:27,341 --> 00:41:29,710
on earth.
So you thought this is the perfect woman

996
00:41:29,711 --> 00:41:31,390
for me,
even though she was with my friend,

997
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:32,750
you know,
to be there.

998
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:33,890
There they do.

999
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:35,560
Of course,
you know,

1000
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:40,600
and then.
But as soon as we became a couple first 

1001
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,991
thing that like,
sex gone immediately and we didn't have 

1002
00:41:42,991 --> 00:41:46,211
sex for 11 years,
we were together 11 years and we'd have 

1003
00:41:46,211 --> 00:41:48,050
sex maybe once a year.
Oh my God.

1004
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,720
How did you have two kids a once a year?
Well,

1005
00:41:50,721 --> 00:41:53,390
how really?
I have very motel sperm.

1006
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,880
Um,
Holy Shit.

1007
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,610
We had kids because she decided she 
wanted to get pregnant.

1008
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:00,860
And even at that point I thought,
oh,

1009
00:42:00,861 --> 00:42:02,120
well,
at least we'll get laid.

1010
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:08,420
And uh,
but what were your friends while this 

1011
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:08,420
was all going on?
Well,

1012
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:08,420
what,
what,

1013
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:08,420
uh,
men friends always do,

1014
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:11,300
but depends on the men friends.
They never say anything.

1015
00:42:11,301 --> 00:42:13,610
They just sit there and quietly eight 
and hate her.

1016
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,690
Not Me,
man.

1017
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,900
I've learned from the Phil Hartman.
Yeah.

1018
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,470
Experience.
I tell people.

1019
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:23,500
Yeah.
And whenever I think that my friends in 

1020
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:23,500
a bad situation,
I,

1021
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:23,500
I'll,
I will pull them aside.

1022
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:23,500
I've,
I've offered,

1023
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,130
which is risk you should take for a 
friend,

1024
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:27,020
you know,
stay at my house.

1025
00:42:27,021 --> 00:42:29,720
Dunkin stayed at my house for a few 
months after he got out.

1026
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,790
You know,
you've got to tell people like,

1027
00:42:31,791 --> 00:42:36,791
Bro,
you're stuck and you think for some 

1028
00:42:36,791 --> 00:42:36,791
reason or other,
this person is a part of your life.

1029
00:42:36,791 --> 00:42:38,120
They are not.
This is,

1030
00:42:38,121 --> 00:42:40,700
this is a show that you're tuning into 
the you can shut off.

1031
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,450
For me,
it was like this.

1032
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:44,600
A lot of guilt about how we started the 
course.

1033
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,280
And then eventually,
eventually,

1034
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:47,370
you know,
I'm going,

1035
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:52,510
you know,
I'm almost as crazy as she is after 11 

1036
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:53,300
years of no fucking,
your brain doesn't function properly,

1037
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:58,860
you know,
and it's also 11 years of like twice a 

1038
00:42:58,860 --> 00:42:58,860
month.
Suicide threats,

1039
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:01,150
you know,
God,

1040
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:07,440
you know.
And then I got to the point where I was 

1041
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:07,440
so crazy.
I thought,

1042
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:07,440
well,
at least if we have a kid,

1043
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,610
you know,
if we have a kid,

1044
00:43:08,611 --> 00:43:10,190
she won't kill herself when I leave.

1045
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:17,260
That's how crazy.
And literally within less than a month 

1046
00:43:17,451 --> 00:43:20,570
after my son was born,
uh,

1047
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:23,060
out of nowhere she goes,
you're not even thinking about it.

1048
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,270
And I think if you left me,
even with a baby,

1049
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:29,300
I would still kill myself.
Like so you could read my mind.

1050
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,550
Whoa.
I've been thinking about it.

1051
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:33,650
Holy Shit.
It was like,

1052
00:43:33,651 --> 00:43:34,520
oh,
really?

1053
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:37,230
You make me feel better about myself,
Dave?

1054
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:41,810
Some really eyeopening moments on that 
set.

1055
00:43:41,811 --> 00:43:45,800
I learned so much about all sorts of 
different types of relationships hanging

1056
00:43:45,801 --> 00:43:47,060
out with you guys.
Oh yeah.

1057
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:50,780
Well everyone was pretty fucked up in 
those marriages were in bad shape.

1058
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,110
Yeah,
yeah,

1059
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:53,750
yeah.
The only one that wasn't.

1060
00:43:53,751 --> 00:43:55,490
Well,
I guess Andy Wasn't really married,

1061
00:43:55,491 --> 00:43:59,480
right?
Kids married wasn't even with.

1062
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:02,300
I've forgotten her name now.
Lena.

1063
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:03,320
Lena.
Yes.

1064
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:05,930
You're sort of married,
sort of whatever it was.

1065
00:44:05,931 --> 00:44:07,820
They might've jumped over a fucking 
broom,

1066
00:44:07,821 --> 00:44:12,821
like unreads.
I don't know if it actually made it to 

1067
00:44:13,041 --> 00:44:15,950
the courtroom and time to sign papers,
but yeah.

1068
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:18,350
Well you know,
how many relationships are right?

1069
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:19,850
Yeah,
you are together,

1070
00:44:19,851 --> 00:44:24,851
but I remember being startled when we 
all came back from hiatus and the only 

1071
00:44:25,131 --> 00:44:30,131
one who was divorced was a steve route,
but we thought you were happy.

1072
00:44:30,321 --> 00:44:32,220
I know he got fucked.
Hard

1073
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:37,220
to.
Here's another one that I learned from 

1074
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:37,220
when Steve,
Steve,

1075
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:39,801
his entire life as a working actor who's
a brilliant actor but had done like a 

1076
00:44:39,801 --> 00:44:43,840
lot of very small things and never 
gotten any notoriety until newsradio.

1077
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:47,820
I mean he was really struggling.
I believe he said he had never made more

1078
00:44:47,821 --> 00:44:52,821
than 50 or $60,000
in an entire year ever before news 

1079
00:44:52,821 --> 00:44:56,811
radio.
Then all of a sudden he does news radio 

1080
00:44:56,811 --> 00:44:58,020
and he's making really good money and 
then his wife gets a divorce and expects

1081
00:44:58,021 --> 00:45:00,840
to be paid for half the length of the 
relationship,

1082
00:45:00,841 --> 00:45:05,841
the money he's making now,
so she just got instantly use like 

1083
00:45:05,841 --> 00:45:08,940
within a couple months this new 
lifestyle and he was giving her $10,000

1084
00:45:08,941 --> 00:45:11,880
a month and going fucking crazy.
You know,

1085
00:45:11,881 --> 00:45:16,080
I remember just seeing him just couldn't
really pay for,

1086
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:17,690
you know,
lived in a small apartment,

1087
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:19,680
was fucking struggling with trying to 
put it together

1088
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:21,880
at that time.
I was like,

1089
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:24,130
when?
When I split up,

1090
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:28,180
she was going through about 50 grand a 
month and that was before we had.

1091
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:31,000
That was before we had it like a 
separation agreement.

1092
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:32,900
Half a million a year.
Yeah.

1093
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:33,880
Oh my God.

1094
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:34,900
Running,
spending it.

1095
00:45:34,901 --> 00:45:37,120
And you have to make a million to spend 
a half a million.

1096
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,180
Yeah.
Yeah.

1097
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:43,840
She's been so fun.
She was renovating the house constantly 

1098
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:44,520
to be heard.
To be heard though.

1099
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:50,650
She rescate redlands had the backyard 
landscape twice because she decided she 

1100
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:53,090
didn't like where the Koi pond was.
Oh my God.

1101
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:57,140
You know,
that's ponds are pretty awesome.

1102
00:45:57,141 --> 00:45:57,830
No.
Yeah,

1103
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,660
that's one thing I've always thought 
about getting need.

1104
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:01,360
That's nice.
You know,

1105
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:04,660
like you can't really raise a child in a
healthy home without a collective.

1106
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:09,710
That was at her argument,
their argument and it was all for the 

1107
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:09,710
kids.
Yeah.

1108
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:11,000
The kids need a Koi pond.
Kids need to go to Morocco.

1109
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:16,030
Yeah.
Worry about getting bitten by a 

1110
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:18,251
poisonous insects.
She turned like the third issue kept 

1111
00:46:18,251 --> 00:46:18,860
renovating this house,
like least spent like another,

1112
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,360
like a half a million dollars renovating
it,

1113
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:21,380
fully renovated house.

1114
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:22,930
It's just so straight.
I mean,

1115
00:46:22,931 --> 00:46:27,931
like I,
I'm married now and I think about the 

1116
00:46:27,931 --> 00:46:29,560
legal ramifications of that and I do 
have a prenuptial and all that stuff and

1117
00:46:29,561 --> 00:46:34,561
I,
and I absolutely think that marriage is 

1118
00:46:34,561 --> 00:46:34,561
retarded.
I still think it's retarded,

1119
00:46:34,561 --> 00:46:36,220
but Mrs Rogan doesn't know and I love 
her,

1120
00:46:36,221 --> 00:46:38,620
so I was willing to do it for because I 
think it's crazy,

1121
00:46:38,621 --> 00:46:43,621
but got it everywhere around me is just 
people with bullet holes in their heads 

1122
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,350
and then I'm saying I don't think I 
should put this gun in my mouth.

1123
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:48,640
Like,
trust me,

1124
00:46:48,641 --> 00:46:51,430
it'll be fine,
but it's just like,

1125
00:46:51,431 --> 00:46:55,540
I just see the remanence of,
of divorce everywhere is constantly.

1126
00:46:55,720 --> 00:47:00,720
The legal idea of it is just so it seems
so ridiculous that you would get two 

1127
00:47:01,781 --> 00:47:06,781
people in a relationship and force them 
either to be together or to distribute 

1128
00:47:06,781 --> 00:47:08,140
money.
No,

1129
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,600
it's fucking.
It's so crazy.

1130
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:15,890
Yeah.
I'm terrified to get married just 

1131
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:15,950
because my own parents getting a divorce
and just stories like this.

1132
00:47:15,951 --> 00:47:20,951
It's like I'm scared as fuck my parents 
not getting a divorce was equally 

1133
00:47:20,951 --> 00:47:21,960
terrifying was.
Yeah.

1134
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:23,960
Yeah.
You know,

1135
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:25,670
but no,
it's true.

1136
00:47:25,671 --> 00:47:27,290
I mean,
I've been divorced twice now,

1137
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:30,100
you know,
you went it on both ends,

1138
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:31,990
right?
You went back into it after all that you

1139
00:47:31,991 --> 00:47:33,600
went back and.
Well,

1140
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:34,940
you know,
motherfucker,

1141
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:36,430
you know,
and again,

1142
00:47:36,431 --> 00:47:37,630
I didn't really,
it wasn't really.

1143
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:38,890
I don't really believe in marriage 
either,

1144
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:42,700
but the US is not set up for you not to 
be married if you're Canadian.

1145
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:43,650
Uh,
or no.

1146
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:45,310
Even I think even for Americans,
there's no,

1147
00:47:45,311 --> 00:47:46,930
like,
real civil union.

1148
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:47,440
No,
no,

1149
00:47:47,441 --> 00:47:48,360
like,
you know.

1150
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:53,370
Okay.
So you're worried about like if you had 

1151
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:53,370
to go to the hospital,
she couldn't come visit you.

1152
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:57,241
That's actually seemed like she,
like she almost died in an emergency 

1153
00:47:57,241 --> 00:47:59,110
ward wants and I couldn't get any 
information about her and I couldn't see

1154
00:47:59,111 --> 00:48:00,210
her.
Um,

1155
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,430
because you weren't married?
Yeah.

1156
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:03,130
Oh fuck.
You know.

1157
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:04,040
And as I,
after that,

1158
00:48:04,041 --> 00:48:06,340
in this country,
this country is weird,

1159
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:09,580
but it's not weird because how would 
they know if she's in a coma?

1160
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:11,200
That you're not just some creepy fucked 
up,

1161
00:48:11,201 --> 00:48:12,580
put her in a coma.
You know what I mean?

1162
00:48:12,581 --> 00:48:14,200
You could be some weird stalker.
I mean,

1163
00:48:14,201 --> 00:48:19,201
unless you're,
you're actually the husband that you're 

1164
00:48:19,201 --> 00:48:22,021
the current boyfriend,
you could be the ex boyfriend and still 

1165
00:48:22,021 --> 00:48:24,480
trying to get her back,
but you can see why in that 

1166
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:24,480
circumstance.
Why,

1167
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,230
why if you're gay,
you're gay marriage,

1168
00:48:26,231 --> 00:48:27,430
not sure.
Not just some.

1169
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:32,700
Something similar to get into marriage 
and that's to me one of the most 

1170
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:36,811
fascinating arguments and immediately 
labels you a retard in my book if you 

1171
00:48:36,811 --> 00:48:39,160
think that it's a bad idea that gay 
people shouldn't be married.

1172
00:48:39,161 --> 00:48:44,161
I think all marriage is a bad idea.
I agree with gay marriage is no worse 

1173
00:48:44,161 --> 00:48:45,040
than straight marriage.
Like why would you not?

1174
00:48:45,041 --> 00:48:50,041
One people will start talking about 
taxes and all I hear is I'm gay and I'm 

1175
00:48:50,531 --> 00:48:54,890
hiding it or I'm scared of being gay or 
I'm humbled that that's all I.

1176
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:54,890
Yeah.

1177
00:48:55,200 --> 00:49:00,200
There's a couple of things that somehow 
gay marriage is going to hurt their 

1178
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:00,200
marriage.
Yeah,

1179
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:00,200
exactly.
You know that he has,

1180
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,020
it's going to devalue like,
like you know,

1181
00:49:02,021 --> 00:49:04,160
like you're going to flood the market 
with marriage.

1182
00:49:04,161 --> 00:49:07,600
It's not that Fox show who wants to 
marry a millionaire or anything.

1183
00:49:07,601 --> 00:49:08,290
I mean,
come on.

1184
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:11,530
Stories like this,
housewives of Beverly Hills,

1185
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:14,080
you know,
if anything devalues marriage.

1186
00:49:14,081 --> 00:49:17,410
I mean fucking.
They had a reality show about flavor.

1187
00:49:17,411 --> 00:49:19,150
Flave getting married.
You know what I mean?

1188
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:20,030
It wasn't,
you know,

1189
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:21,400
nobody,
nobody protested.

1190
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:23,630
This is devalued.
I'd show up at that rally.

1191
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:25,870
There was two guys.
There's,

1192
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:29,170
there's two guys that I know that live 
in down the street and they're okay.

1193
00:49:29,171 --> 00:49:31,120
And they have kids.
They adopted it.

1194
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:36,180
They actually didn't adopt a kid stop 
combined their sperm together and hired 

1195
00:49:36,821 --> 00:49:41,821
someone to carry their baby.
And the first woman changed her mind 

1196
00:49:41,821 --> 00:49:44,980
right after they had paid for everything
and took care of her for nine months and

1197
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:47,830
gave her a salary and the baby comes out
and she goes,

1198
00:49:47,831 --> 00:49:48,700
I think I'm going to keep it.

1199
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:50,680
And they're like.
And like they,

1200
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:52,930
they had spent like hundreds of 
thousands of dollars.

1201
00:49:52,931 --> 00:49:57,931
They had given her a salary for the 
entire year and then they had spent all 

1202
00:49:57,931 --> 00:50:01,411
this money in medical procedures and 
taken care of all of her medical bills 

1203
00:50:01,411 --> 00:50:01,630
and all that stuff.
And then at the end she's like,

1204
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:02,930
psych.
It's,

1205
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:07,950
my kid just took it.
And so they went through the whole 

1206
00:50:07,950 --> 00:50:11,221
process again and then had a kid,
so there wasn't any kind of like court 

1207
00:50:11,221 --> 00:50:13,630
thing they could've done or contracts or
nothing you can do.

1208
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:15,370
It's her baby.
It comes out of her body.

1209
00:50:15,371 --> 00:50:17,350
You can't take her baby,
you cannot tell.

1210
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:18,430
But there should be like,
hey,

1211
00:50:18,431 --> 00:50:20,020
we're giving you this.
Money shouldn't be really.

1212
00:50:20,021 --> 00:50:22,540
You don't have to pay it back and the 
sperm and there shouldn't be,

1213
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,290
you know,
it's,

1214
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:27,290
it's.
I think what she did was,

1215
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:30,980
you know,
I mean probably deceptive maybe,

1216
00:50:30,981 --> 00:50:32,750
but who knows,
maybe she just changed her mind.

1217
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:37,750
She was overwhelmed by emotions and 
couldn't believe that the idea that 

1218
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:38,160
she's going to leave this kid behind in 
the world and just go about it.

1219
00:50:38,161 --> 00:50:43,161
You wouldn't be able to deal with it.
I see her point of view more than I see 

1220
00:50:43,161 --> 00:50:45,581
their point of view.
Definitely did was shoot a load and a 

1221
00:50:45,581 --> 00:50:45,581
spend some money and you have a baby.
It's.

1222
00:50:45,581 --> 00:50:50,290
Yeah.
What ultimately when it comes down to 

1223
00:50:50,290 --> 00:50:50,290
it,
if you can't say goodbye to that baby,

1224
00:50:50,290 --> 00:50:51,980
you can't say goodbye to me.
To me,

1225
00:50:51,981 --> 00:50:56,981
seeing my wife have kids,
seeing the baby come out of her body 

1226
00:50:56,981 --> 00:50:58,350
being there,
the moment the baby's born,

1227
00:50:58,370 --> 00:50:59,840
seeing the bond,
seeing this,

1228
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,190
this,
this moment.

1229
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:03,140
Fuck man.
You can't take the baby away.

1230
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:06,470
The baby has to be in trouble.
If you'd take the baby away,

1231
00:51:06,471 --> 00:51:08,960
it has to be some crazy math head or a 
bad person.

1232
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,360
I mean that's the only way she'd take 
her baby away and it's like,

1233
00:51:11,361 --> 00:51:15,800
this is our nature bond.
That's a soul stealing bond.

1234
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,570
I have a buddy and his ex girlfriend was
a.

1235
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:24,160
She was a stripper when she was 16.
She had a baby and gave it up for 

1236
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,330
prostitutes or for adoption rather for 
prostitution and can you do that?

1237
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:31,500
You decide so early in Taiwan,
you can find them nice pimp and she was.

1238
00:51:31,581 --> 00:51:33,860
This poor girl was wrecked for the rest 
of her life.

1239
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:36,290
She was devastated.
Whenever she would drink,

1240
00:51:36,291 --> 00:51:41,291
whenever she would be out,
she would just think about that baby 

1241
00:51:41,291 --> 00:51:42,050
that she had when she was 16.
Now that it's out there in the world and

1242
00:51:42,051 --> 00:51:47,051
that she's the mother and she just has 
this hole in her soul forever and she 

1243
00:51:47,051 --> 00:51:48,870
couldn't make up no matter what she did,
she couldn't fill it up with drugs.

1244
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:50,840
She couldn't fill it out with Dick.
She couldn't figure out.

1245
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:53,350
She couldn't fill it up.
It just as a whole that.

1246
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,720
And so these poor guys down the street,
you know,

1247
00:51:56,770 --> 00:52:01,770
they,
they spent the money but they have 

1248
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:01,770
money.
They're going to be fun.

1249
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:01,770
You know,
they got ripped off.

1250
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:01,770
No big deal.
Yeah.

1251
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,490
They,
they now they have a kid.

1252
00:52:03,491 --> 00:52:08,491
It's really fascinating though because 
the kid is starting to get a little 

1253
00:52:08,491 --> 00:52:08,491
older now.
He's like four or five,

1254
00:52:08,491 --> 00:52:12,670
you know,
and now when I see him he's trying to 

1255
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:12,670
go,
where the fuck is my mother?

1256
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:16,010
Everybody else has a lady around them,
these two dudes all the time.

1257
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:20,240
So I'm sure it's pretty weird for him.
And why is everything so tiny?

1258
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:28,000
It's fashion sense.
I mean what happens with gay guys when 

1259
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:28,000
they get divorced?
How does that work?

1260
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,120
I mean,
how do you decide who's the wife,

1261
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:29,990
you know,
is it,

1262
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:32,610
is it who's working and who's not,
which ones would you want to,

1263
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:37,620
but as tight in the bud is tighter or 
looser?

1264
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:44,510
That never understood the whole top and 
bottom thing that I was gay.

1265
00:52:44,511 --> 00:52:45,860
I would just,
I would be versatile.

1266
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,730
Move it around.
Do you not,

1267
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:53,930
you know,
give and receive it and I don't 

1268
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:53,930
understand that.
How rude.

1269
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:57,530
Well,
I think some gay guys liked the rude 

1270
00:52:57,530 --> 00:52:57,530
guys though,
because we just want to shut up,

1271
00:52:57,530 --> 00:53:01,890
get smacked him in the face,
then run out the door and that's what 

1272
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:01,890
they're looking for.
They're looking for some weird,

1273
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:03,350
abusive sort of a situation.
I just can't.

1274
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:04,440
I just can't understand me.
The,

1275
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:05,990
the other,
the guy that does the abusive.

1276
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,540
Do you know anybody that's a guy that's 
getting alimony?

1277
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,400
I'm Liz and Maura Pang issue.
I think so.

1278
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:15,740
Really still.
I don't know.

1279
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:19,270
Maybe that was,
that was a crazy situation to more.

1280
00:53:19,271 --> 00:53:20,990
I can't be on the podcast and tell us 
about it.

1281
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:23,270
She would,
she'd probably wouldn't give it up.

1282
00:53:24,010 --> 00:53:26,100
It's a crazy story,
unfortunately.

1283
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:27,920
You're fucked folks.
Yeah.

1284
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:29,040
Um,
yeah,

1285
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:34,100
I know one dude,
I know one dude who married a model and 

1286
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:36,861
he was a loser and he was an actor and 
she's a very famous model and she's 

1287
00:53:36,931 --> 00:53:41,931
still paying them and they have kids 
together as well and she still has to 

1288
00:53:41,931 --> 00:53:42,240
pay him.
Sounds Nice.

1289
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:43,750
I never thought about that.
Am I am?

1290
00:53:43,751 --> 00:53:45,480
I try to do that.
Sam Arnold.

1291
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:51,260
Tom Arnold got paid a fuckload of money 
with a Kirstie alley.

1292
00:53:51,691 --> 00:53:53,600
Didn't she pay out?
Did she divorced?

1293
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,940
Ditching young skippy.
Yeah,

1294
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:58,290
because she was married to.
What's his name?

1295
00:53:58,291 --> 00:53:59,340
Parker Stevenson,
right?

1296
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:05,070
Wasn't he the guy from the hardy boys 
when it wasn't cassidy?

1297
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:10,250
Right.
What happened to that guy like Joey 

1298
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:12,180
Lawrence right now?
You know that guy that plays cds again?

1299
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:15,650
Fucking completely vanished.
Yeah,

1300
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,120
I forgot he even existed until you just 
said his name.

1301
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:23,250
Yeah.
Like I might not have thought about him 

1302
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:23,250
in 10 years or wherever.

1303
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:23,790
Again,
happens to dudes like that,

1304
00:54:23,791 --> 00:54:26,850
that act for a long time and then they 
just stop and vanish.

1305
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:32,200
I don't know,
I just keep wondering if it's happened 

1306
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:33,830
to me yet in everything.
What?

1307
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:36,570
One of my favorite video games fall out,
like,

1308
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:38,140
oh yeah,
I keep hearing about that.

1309
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:43,260
Been such an awesome game.
I haven't played because I don't play 

1310
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:46,101
any video games because I don't know how
well for the longest time you did the 

1311
00:54:46,101 --> 00:54:46,470
poker show.
Yeah.

1312
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:49,620
And so after news radio,
what did you do after news radio?

1313
00:54:49,621 --> 00:54:53,130
Did you try to develop something else?
Had like three or four development deals

1314
00:54:53,131 --> 00:54:58,131
after that wrote about.
I wrote like about five pilots for 

1315
00:54:58,131 --> 00:54:59,730
different networks in different studios 
and none of them sold.

1316
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:02,940
And that was it then?
Yeah.

1317
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,760
Then it was doing a bunch of movies.
Brain candy.

1318
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:07,290
Yeah.
What brain candy,

1319
00:55:07,291 --> 00:55:12,291
your shot while we were doing his radio 
is another lesson I learned that I have 

1320
00:55:12,291 --> 00:55:12,291
to remember before I forget,
um,

1321
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:14,640
that I learned about the movie business.

1322
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:18,270
Dave had a fucking great movie called 
the wrong guy.

1323
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:23,330
Yeah.
And it was a great movie and we went to 

1324
00:55:23,330 --> 00:55:23,330
see it.
I think Brian Callum went to say it with

1325
00:55:23,330 --> 00:55:25,620
me and we were fucking howling and I was
like,

1326
00:55:25,621 --> 00:55:27,540
Holy Shit,
David's going to be a huge movie star.

1327
00:55:27,541 --> 00:55:30,550
There's going to be a huge movie and I 
remember watching it going like,

1328
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:34,770
this is one of the best comedies I've 
seen in years and then nothing.

1329
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:36,450
Yeah,
Disney shelved it.

1330
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:42,020
Yeah.
Well what happened was how Hollywood 

1331
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:43,260
pictures was our distributor at Disney 
and they shut Hollywood pictures down in

1332
00:55:43,261 --> 00:55:47,130
the middle of production and then when 
we're done,

1333
00:55:47,131 --> 00:55:52,131
they reopened Hollywood pictures but 
with the new president of Hollywood 

1334
00:55:52,131 --> 00:55:54,981
pictures and he didn't want to touch any
of this stuff that the other guy had 

1335
00:55:54,981 --> 00:55:56,960
started a like that because if it's 
there,

1336
00:55:57,150 --> 00:55:58,950
if it's a failure,
it's their failure.

1337
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:01,740
But if it's a success,
it's the other guy success.

1338
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,110
So they just don't deal with it.
So they uh,

1339
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:07,860
so it got shelved for like five years.
Like they would even admit they hand it.

1340
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:11,430
So it never had a theatrical release.
Never got theatrical release.

1341
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:12,790
So it's available on DVD,
right?

1342
00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:15,330
Can't get it on Amazon.com.
$10 on Amazon right now.

1343
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:20,560
Really?
Well then the people should probably 

1344
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:20,560
pick that up.
Yeah,

1345
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:22,730
I'm going to pick it up right now.
What's one click while we're doing the 

1346
00:56:22,730 --> 00:56:22,740
podcast?
So far that it's actually what I'm.

1347
00:56:22,741 --> 00:56:24,640
One of the things I'm proudest of is 
that movie,

1348
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:27,220
like creatively comedically.
It was brilliant,

1349
00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:28,990
you know,
it was eric goes,

1350
00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:32,200
watch this one click.
Oh Don.

1351
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:34,590
It's that easy.
People love Amazon dogs.

1352
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:36,510
Yeah.
That was a brilliant fucking movie.

1353
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:41,530
Was really fun.
I enjoyed the shit out of it and I 

1354
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:41,530
remember you guys all coming out to see 
it that,

1355
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:42,590
that screening and yeah.

1356
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:47,670
Yeah.
And I remember thinking after is over 

1357
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:47,670
after the whole thing where it didn't 
work out and it never got.

1358
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:47,670
I'm like,
wow,

1359
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:49,360
well this is,
this business is crazy.

1360
00:56:49,361 --> 00:56:52,600
Like this doesn't make any sense.
I know because we really thought we were

1361
00:56:52,601 --> 00:56:53,620
clear because we had,
you know,

1362
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:58,650
the big thing was always,
well if you're doing an independent 

1363
00:56:58,650 --> 00:56:58,650
film,
can you get distribution?

1364
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:02,970
And we went into it with distribution.
We had Disney lined up in the script 

1365
00:57:02,970 --> 00:57:03,020
phase,
you know,

1366
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:05,230
uh,
so we had distribution lined up.

1367
00:57:05,231 --> 00:57:07,420
We had,
we even had a,

1368
00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:12,510
we were even in profit in foreign sales 
while we were shooting the movie based 

1369
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:13,680
on a trailer.
Whoa.

1370
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:15,940
That was taken to can.
So,

1371
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:16,690
uh,
we had,

1372
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:21,960
we had advanced sales,
foreign sales that put the movie in 

1373
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:24,931
profit while we were shooting,
but they were all contingent on a US 

1374
00:57:24,931 --> 00:57:24,931
release.

1375
00:57:24,931 --> 00:57:29,720
It seems like you could get a meeting 
and talk to the new head and go retail.

1376
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,050
We tried it for years.
Thank you.

1377
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:37,080
Will make a big deal.
We'll do press releases and we tried 

1378
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:41,840
talking to Disney for a year and they 
just wouldn't have anything to do with 

1379
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:41,840
now.
Wow.

1380
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:46,220
Other,
there were other people even tried to 

1381
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:46,220
buy it from Disney and they wouldn't 
sell it.

1382
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:46,220
Really?
Yeah.

1383
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:50,430
Wow.
Because of the success then they fucked 

1384
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:50,430
up.
Yeah.

1385
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:51,130
Wow.
What a creepy fucking business.

1386
00:57:51,131 --> 00:57:52,870
You wonder why Dave Chappelle went to 
Africa.

1387
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,450
Yeah.
Well,

1388
00:57:54,550 --> 00:57:55,880
and it's beautiful.
There it is.

1389
00:57:55,900 --> 00:58:00,900
Beautiful.
And especially if you can get away from 

1390
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:00,900
the hippos.
The flies are nice.

1391
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:00,900
So,
um,

1392
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:03,880
so now you're divorced twice.
Yeah.

1393
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:08,560
And thank God my second ex wife is sane 
and decent.

1394
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:10,580
She was very nice person.
I met her a couple times.

1395
00:58:10,810 --> 00:58:14,220
I met her at a fucking,
a satanic ritual on,

1396
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:15,750
on,
uh Oh,

1397
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:17,050
I wasn't there for that.

1398
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:18,550
Yeah,
that was that.

1399
00:58:18,551 --> 00:58:19,540
It was some six,
six,

1400
00:58:19,541 --> 00:58:20,710
six show.
Yeah,

1401
00:58:20,711 --> 00:58:23,530
it was the birthday of a famous 
satanist.

1402
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:29,750
Levay Danzig was there,
Duncan did performed with a satanic 

1403
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:31,380
puppet.
Our friend Duncan,

1404
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:36,540
and your wife was there as like some 
devil woman dressed up doing some 

1405
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:38,040
singing backup or something crazy.
Yeah.

1406
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:39,660
And Hank Williams,
the third was there.

1407
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:44,690
That was a great show man.
Watch and Hank Williams and Danzig 

1408
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:47,270
together hanging backstage and like I'm 
hanging out with Danzig.

1409
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:49,120
Right.
Very weird.

1410
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:50,310
Yeah,
that was a fun.

1411
00:58:50,350 --> 00:58:51,850
That was a fun Gig.
Yeah,

1412
00:58:51,851 --> 00:58:56,851
it was weird.
We were really hammered around a really 

1413
00:58:56,851 --> 00:58:56,851
high rather around a bunch of fucking 
satanist.

1414
00:58:56,851 --> 00:58:58,000
Yeah.
Yeah.

1415
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,110
Very,
very odd.

1416
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:04,140
That was a weird phase that Duncan,
our friend Doug and went through 

1417
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:06,640
[inaudible] for a while.
He was taking me to like graveyards to 

1418
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,040
like hang out with that Antwan,
the guy doing all.

1419
00:59:08,070 --> 00:59:10,120
Yeah,
I'd go to these people's houses and they

1420
00:59:10,121 --> 00:59:11,250
would have like a,
you know,

1421
00:59:11,251 --> 00:59:15,490
like the dolls with like the whatever.
We put needles in them and stuff and I'm

1422
00:59:15,491 --> 00:59:16,260
like,
I,

1423
00:59:16,290 --> 00:59:19,050
I was really kind of getting it for 
awhile.

1424
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:19,570
It was like,
oh,

1425
00:59:19,571 --> 00:59:20,890
I get it now.
It's kind of,

1426
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,070
they're doing it

1427
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:24,080
almost as a joke.
Almost like,

1428
00:59:24,081 --> 00:59:24,680
you know,
that will be.

1429
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:26,340
Dunkin was about Dunkin was.
Yeah.

1430
00:59:26,341 --> 00:59:31,190
But it will satanism to a lot of people 
is just a hedonism.

1431
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:36,250
It's just living life and with pleasure 
and enjoying all the jelly and against 

1432
00:59:36,250 --> 00:59:38,360
Christian morality.
Yeah.

1433
00:59:38,361 --> 00:59:43,361
I mean it's not really like sacrificing 
babies are killing goats or anything 

1434
00:59:43,361 --> 00:59:43,361
stupid like that.
Yeah.

1435
00:59:43,370 --> 00:59:45,800
So do you have to say,
well this is why I brought this up.

1436
00:59:45,801 --> 00:59:46,340
So,
uh,

1437
00:59:46,530 --> 00:59:51,530
I ran into you on twitter.
I saw you on twitter and one of the 

1438
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:54,011
first things I saw you on twitter was 
you talking about how you had just 

1439
00:59:54,011 --> 00:59:57,701
gotten a,
the court had just told you you have to 

1440
00:59:57,701 --> 00:59:59,750
pay three times your monthly salary in 
alimony.

1441
01:00:00,010 --> 01:00:01,650
Yeah.
And I guess two time slept,

1442
01:00:01,651 --> 01:00:05,230
but I would say is an average because a 
lot of months I don't have a salary.

1443
01:00:05,630 --> 01:00:06,110
Uh,
no.

1444
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:07,550
Yeah,
they had a,

1445
01:00:07,630 --> 01:00:12,630
I have to pay $17,700
a month or go to jail for 10 days every 

1446
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:19,650
month that I'm late without warning that
that was the judge's ruling jail for 10 

1447
01:00:19,721 --> 01:00:24,721
days.
So do you have to bit be exported to 

1448
01:00:24,721 --> 01:00:24,721
Canada as well?
That's the thing.

1449
01:00:24,721 --> 01:00:27,220
I'm here.
So do you know say fuck you.

1450
01:00:27,221 --> 01:00:29,140
I live here now and to stay here,
but I,

1451
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:31,050
yeah,
I can't risk going back to Canada or she

1452
01:00:31,051 --> 01:00:32,020
will go to jail.
Yeah.

1453
01:00:32,110 --> 01:00:36,610
Whoa.
So unless I've come up with $17,700,

1454
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:40,300
which in a month where I haven't earned 
anything is a little hard to do man.

1455
01:00:40,330 --> 01:00:43,280
So how much are you sending over there?
Are you trying to like whatever.

1456
01:00:43,290 --> 01:00:44,920
I'm like yeah,
like I said,

1457
01:00:44,921 --> 01:00:48,010
five grand this past month in addition 
go crazy.

1458
01:00:48,010 --> 01:00:53,010
Twenty grand a few in November to she'd 
go crazy and yell at you like you need 

1459
01:00:53,010 --> 01:00:54,640
more and she hasn't talked to me 
directly,

1460
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:56,470
you know,
really sold through lawyers.

1461
01:00:56,890 --> 01:00:58,930
But again,
they were trying,

1462
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:01,480
uh,
through this organization called the fro

1463
01:01:01,481 --> 01:01:06,130
the family responsibility office in 
Ontario that,

1464
01:01:06,131 --> 01:01:11,131
and this,
this legal office is really responsible 

1465
01:01:11,131 --> 01:01:14,731
for handing a lot of men to their death.
Like there's a real problem with like 

1466
01:01:14,731 --> 01:01:16,210
people committing suicide,
um,

1467
01:01:16,270 --> 01:01:20,260
after being prosecuted by these people.
And uh,

1468
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:21,970
they,
uh,

1469
01:01:22,030 --> 01:01:24,310
they were trying to get me like in 
November,

1470
01:01:24,311 --> 01:01:26,440
I was sitting in a court in like 
November 20th,

1471
01:01:26,441 --> 01:01:29,530
I guess,
sitting in court and thinking at the end

1472
01:01:29,530 --> 01:01:31,690
of that day,
I might go to jail for six months.

1473
01:01:31,990 --> 01:01:36,990
They were,
they were pushing for me to go to jail 

1474
01:01:36,990 --> 01:01:36,990
for six months.
This is what the fro was asking,

1475
01:01:36,990 --> 01:01:40,570
six month jail sentence if I didn't come
up with half a million dollars that day,

1476
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:46,800
um,
and an additional 30 days for every 

1477
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:46,900
month.

1478
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:50,260
I didn't come up with the money.
Oh my God.

1479
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:51,700
So,
and I was saying they're going,

1480
01:01:51,701 --> 01:01:52,270
well,
the judge,

1481
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:54,490
if he goes for it,
I in jail for life,

1482
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:59,520
they'll cuff me there that day,
take me to jail and I'll go to jail for 

1483
01:01:59,651 --> 01:02:01,660
six months.
The end of six months they'll say,

1484
01:02:01,710 --> 01:02:06,710
you know,
we'll do you have the half million 

1485
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:08,290
dollars and plus the ongoing money that 
would accrue over the six months.

1486
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:09,610
And I'd say,
no,

1487
01:02:09,611 --> 01:02:11,330
I'd been in jail for six months.
I was,

1488
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:12,790
I supposed to earn any money.
All right.

1489
01:02:12,791 --> 01:02:15,700
That's another 30 days to end of that.
Thirty days you get the money.

1490
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:16,810
No,
I've been in jail.

1491
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:20,520
So it's essentially a life sentence.
Unless someone gives $500,000.

1492
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:21,570
Yeah.
How long,

1493
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:24,150
how long,
how much longer do you have for this?

1494
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,130
Uh,
well it's really,

1495
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:28,920
it's unending until I pay off the 
arrears,

1496
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:34,400
that io or you know,
and that's crazy one then till the kids 

1497
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:38,400
are a 22,
if they stay in school so,

1498
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:43,480
and the skin.
And so then the money just keeps adding 

1499
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:43,760
up and my dick off tonight.
Yeah.

1500
01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:44,240
Like,
I mean,

1501
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:46,020
don't know,
just don't marry Canadian shirk.

1502
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:48,630
Yeah.
I mean in order to pay $17,700,

1503
01:02:48,631 --> 01:02:51,570
I have to earn about $40,000
in a month just to pay that.

1504
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:52,210
Just,
you know,

1505
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:54,780
you know,
with 20 percent commission,

1506
01:02:54,781 --> 01:02:58,180
35 percent tax bracket.
Um,

1507
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:00,420
you know,
so I've got to earn $40,000

1508
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:03,510
just to have $0.
Fuck.

1509
01:03:04,050 --> 01:03:07,110
And it's someone you hate.
Yeah.

1510
01:03:07,111 --> 01:03:09,570
Yeah.
And who didn't fuck me for 11 years

1511
01:03:12,430 --> 01:03:17,430
raising ass laws.
And then when you tell them that you 

1512
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:17,540
don't make that much money anymore,
what do they call the judge

1513
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:21,730
pat who made this ruling because they 
were asking for the six months.

1514
01:03:21,731 --> 01:03:26,731
Right.
And the judge kept saying to the fro 

1515
01:03:26,731 --> 01:03:26,731
attorney,
uh,

1516
01:03:27,010 --> 01:03:32,010
you know,
give me another option because I'm 

1517
01:03:32,010 --> 01:03:32,010
looking at,
I'm looking at the,

1518
01:03:32,010 --> 01:03:36,310
the,
the financial documents and I'm seeing 

1519
01:03:36,310 --> 01:03:37,560
where all the money,
all the money that has come in,

1520
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:40,510
I'm seeing where it's all gone.
It's all here in this documents,

1521
01:03:40,630 --> 01:03:42,760
all the money that's come in and where 
it's all gone.

1522
01:03:42,761 --> 01:03:47,761
I can see it all in these documents.
So I am convinced that there isn't a 

1523
01:03:47,761 --> 01:03:49,810
half a million dollars from Mr Foley to 
come up with today.

1524
01:03:50,290 --> 01:03:55,290
So if you insist on that ruling,
then I would send them to jail and your 

1525
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:58,690
client will never see another dime 
because Mr Foley's career will be over.

1526
01:03:59,170 --> 01:04:01,030
And that's it.
And he kept saying,

1527
01:04:01,031 --> 01:04:03,910
give me an option that will get your 
client some money.

1528
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:07,300
And the effort refused to say,
well,

1529
01:04:07,301 --> 01:04:08,980
we don't have the authority from our 
client,

1530
01:04:08,981 --> 01:04:11,620
my ex wife,
to make any other offer.

1531
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:15,040
Um,
so for about two hours,

1532
01:04:15,041 --> 01:04:17,950
the judge kept asking them to come up 
with another.

1533
01:04:18,490 --> 01:04:19,840
So all this time when you're sitting 
there,

1534
01:04:19,841 --> 01:04:21,040
you're going,
I'm going to jail.

1535
01:04:21,070 --> 01:04:23,320
Yeah.
And I might be going to jail essentially

1536
01:04:23,321 --> 01:04:24,340
forever.
Yeah.

1537
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:26,140
Yeah.
What happened?

1538
01:04:26,141 --> 01:04:31,141
Going to jail for being,
for the crime of not earning a million 

1539
01:04:31,141 --> 01:04:31,141
dollars.
Oh my God.

1540
01:04:31,141 --> 01:04:32,650
So what happens if that actually does 
happen?

1541
01:04:32,651 --> 01:04:37,651
I mean,
if you have guys gone in jail with a 

1542
01:04:37,651 --> 01:04:37,651
large sum like that and never come out,

1543
01:04:37,651 --> 01:04:39,290
I don't know,
but people have definitely gone to jail.

1544
01:04:39,291 --> 01:04:44,291
And,
and definitely there's a lot of people 

1545
01:04:44,291 --> 01:04:44,291
who had been looking at jail time have 
just killed themselves.

1546
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:46,400
Uh,
can,

1547
01:04:46,430 --> 01:04:48,350
can you get the kids and then have to 
stay with it

1548
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:52,850
so that she has the town one bro.
It's alimony or child support.

1549
01:04:52,851 --> 01:04:54,560
So child support.
This is all child support.

1550
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:55,450
Yeah.
So whoa.

1551
01:04:55,510 --> 01:04:59,120
$70,000
a month in child support.

1552
01:04:59,150 --> 01:05:01,130
Yeah,
still the kids.

1553
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:05,410
What the fuck are your kids eating?
A $17,000

1554
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:09,500
iphone or eating iphones.
It's incredible.

1555
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,150
Yeah.
17,

1556
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:13,490
$17,700
a month.

1557
01:05:14,420 --> 01:05:15,950
That's crazy.
Yeah.

1558
01:05:15,951 --> 01:05:17,380
I would.
I would talk to the and be like,

1559
01:05:17,381 --> 01:05:17,980
Hey,
come live

1560
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,930
with me.
We'll have a TV show together.

1561
01:05:19,940 --> 01:05:23,470
I'll get you a podcast and somehow turn 
the tables.

1562
01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:24,580
Well,
yeah,

1563
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:29,670
I mean get a horse.
I mean get a couple of things about 

1564
01:05:29,670 --> 01:05:30,400
being on the real house.
Husbands of Beverly Hills.

1565
01:05:31,490 --> 01:05:33,700
I'm thinking we can get a reality show 
off the ground.

1566
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:36,160
What are you willing to marry?
A Kardashians?

1567
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:37,540
A.
Oh my God.

1568
01:05:37,550 --> 01:05:38,770
I've look.
Hey,

1569
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:43,330
I can't marry worse than I have because 
they'd probably be a lot better.

1570
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:44,500
Yeah,
crazy.

1571
01:05:44,501 --> 01:05:45,720
They're just ambitious.
Yeah.

1572
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:48,640
Fuck man.
So what's the solution?

1573
01:05:48,641 --> 01:05:52,300
So you cannot go to Canada and you just 
send whatever you have and then you have

1574
01:05:52,301 --> 01:05:57,301
to constantly deal with legal payments 
because they're constantly trying to 

1575
01:05:57,301 --> 01:06:00,211
fuck you.
And so I spent like a year and a half 

1576
01:06:00,211 --> 01:06:00,670
literally going to court every single 
month with lawyers.

1577
01:06:00,730 --> 01:06:05,730
Just basically having to go to court 
every month just to stay out of jail to 

1578
01:06:05,730 --> 01:06:06,910
go and have them put it over to the next
month.

1579
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,530
And the lawyers,
the lawyers,

1580
01:06:09,310 --> 01:06:10,340
you know,
I mean the,

1581
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:12,250
you know,
people that do family law,

1582
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:14,980
a lot of them are really horrible 
people.

1583
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,410
Uh,
and they just make money off misery.

1584
01:06:17,470 --> 01:06:18,790
And even my own lawyers,
we're just,

1585
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:23,820
you know,
extending this as far as they could 

1586
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:23,820
until I ran out of money and like,
and then quit.

1587
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:26,000
So when I went to court for this ruling,
I didn't have,

1588
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:28,510
I didn't have a lawyer because I 
couldn't afford one.

1589
01:06:28,570 --> 01:06:30,430
So you went by yourself,
was there by myself.

1590
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:35,460
Not only was out there by myself,
but all of the documents that had been 

1591
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:38,610
piled up,
all of the evidence that have been 

1592
01:06:38,610 --> 01:06:39,370
bottled up over the course of a year and
a half sitting in my lawyers office.

1593
01:06:39,850 --> 01:06:41,530
Oh my God.
You know.

1594
01:06:41,531 --> 01:06:43,680
So you had no evidence and no lawyer.
Yeah.

1595
01:06:44,950 --> 01:06:46,810
Did you have records?
Did you have any side?

1596
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:48,010
Nothing.
I had nothing.

1597
01:06:48,030 --> 01:06:50,090
God.
So you're just going to there nothing.

1598
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:51,640
I have no money.
I just saw I didn't do.

1599
01:06:51,670 --> 01:06:56,670
Yeah,
and they're asking me questions about 

1600
01:06:56,670 --> 01:06:56,670
files that had been piling up over a 
year and a half,

1601
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:59,890
but I don't know.
I don't recall.

1602
01:06:59,891 --> 01:07:01,360
I don't know because I don't,
you know,

1603
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:06,460
how do they justify such an exorbitant 
amount of money because it's the,

1604
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:11,860
the,
as it was explained to me by my lawyers 

1605
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:14,671
was that the courts have a assumption is
that the children should continue to 

1606
01:07:14,671 --> 01:07:18,091
live at the level they were at,
at the time of the dissolution of the 

1607
01:07:18,091 --> 01:07:19,410
marriage.
So,

1608
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:22,360
which is crazy because if I were still 
married in my income,

1609
01:07:22,361 --> 01:07:26,170
dropped their lifestyle would change.
But because we're not married anymore,

1610
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:28,510
their lifestyles should never change no 
matter what I'm earning.

1611
01:07:28,690 --> 01:07:33,690
Was that the judge,
the ruling that was enforced was by 

1612
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:33,690
another judge named judge justice back 
outs.

1613
01:07:34,270 --> 01:07:39,270
And she's the one who ruled about three,
four years ago when I went back to try 

1614
01:07:39,270 --> 01:07:39,700
and get it adjusted.
I went to,

1615
01:07:39,701 --> 01:07:41,290
um,
to,

1616
01:07:41,291 --> 01:07:46,291
uh,
have to have a hearing to have it 

1617
01:07:46,291 --> 01:07:46,430
adjusted to meet my income.
Um,

1618
01:07:46,690 --> 01:07:51,690
and she ruled against me and in her 
ruling she said my ability to pay was 

1619
01:07:51,690 --> 01:07:55,480
not relevant to my obligation.
So it didn't matter to her what I proved

1620
01:07:55,510 --> 01:08:00,510
my income to be if my income was zero,
she said I was still obligated to pay as

1621
01:08:01,391 --> 01:08:03,520
though I was earning a million dollars.
I know a lot of people saying,

1622
01:08:03,521 --> 01:08:05,860
Joe Rogan this day,
fully guy's bothering me the fuck out.

1623
01:08:05,890 --> 01:08:07,930
I feel like,
well listen,

1624
01:08:07,931 --> 01:08:11,170
this is important shit.
This was my education in,

1625
01:08:11,230 --> 01:08:14,230
in relationships.
And then the law regarding relationships

1626
01:08:14,231 --> 01:08:15,840
as I was growing up,
literally.

1627
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:18,290
I mean when I was on news radio is a 
fresh face boy,

1628
01:08:18,291 --> 01:08:23,291
didn't know Jack Shit about the world.
And this is how I learned about 

1629
01:08:23,291 --> 01:08:26,231
relationships.
This is how I learned about the whole 

1630
01:08:26,231 --> 01:08:27,800
gamut from divorce to fucking murder 
suicide.

1631
01:08:27,890 --> 01:08:29,720
And I learned it all.
You are happily married.

1632
01:08:29,870 --> 01:08:30,530
Yeah.
Crazy.

1633
01:08:30,531 --> 01:08:32,030
What?
You figured it out.

1634
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:33,260
Who?
I'm kind of lucky.

1635
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:35,620
I got lucky.
Could go ugly for me to it.

1636
01:08:35,890 --> 01:08:40,890
I would do in your podcast.
I wouldn't probably seriously just move 

1637
01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:42,720
somewhere like live on a beach in 
Jamaica.

1638
01:08:42,721 --> 01:08:44,780
He loves his kids.
You get to see your kids.

1639
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,180
Not now.
I can't go to Canada so they can't see.

1640
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:50,130
So you don't see him at all?
Was the last time you saw them?

1641
01:08:50,330 --> 01:08:53,860
Uh,
was in uh,

1642
01:08:53,940 --> 01:08:55,280
November.
Wow.

1643
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,770
That would drive me nuts to my size.
Went to see my,

1644
01:08:57,890 --> 01:09:00,670
my sons play at school.
It was less than my son.

1645
01:09:02,070 --> 01:09:03,750
Was the trick there,
the wife?

1646
01:09:03,850 --> 01:09:04,710
No,
she wasn't there.

1647
01:09:04,711 --> 01:09:07,020
Thank God.
So you have no communication with her at

1648
01:09:07,021 --> 01:09:07,440
all?
No,

1649
01:09:07,441 --> 01:09:07,940
no,
no,

1650
01:09:07,950 --> 01:09:09,660
no.
You don't have to pay any more alimony?

1651
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,370
No,
she didn't seek alimony.

1652
01:09:11,371 --> 01:09:14,550
She sought a shout for it because.
Yeah.

1653
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:18,360
But it's none of it got to the kids,
you know,

1654
01:09:18,450 --> 01:09:19,540
it all goes to her.
Yeah.

1655
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:24,330
She was getting all this money and then 
on top of the child support payment,

1656
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:29,360
which is,
she was also getting something called 

1657
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:29,710
section seven expenses,
but just basically anything she chose to

1658
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:32,400
any bills she chose to run up what you 
know.

1659
01:09:32,401 --> 01:09:34,980
So it'd be like $20,000
for summer camp,

1660
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:36,090
things like that.

1661
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:38,220
Anything that was for the kids that she 
chose?

1662
01:09:38,290 --> 01:09:40,170
Yeah.
So not just alimony.

1663
01:09:40,171 --> 01:09:45,171
Not or not just child support,
child support plus and then all of her 

1664
01:09:45,171 --> 01:09:47,430
living expenses and the mortgage and 
everything,

1665
01:09:47,431 --> 01:09:48,540
medical expenses,
everything.

1666
01:09:48,770 --> 01:09:50,070
It just makes me,
it's,

1667
01:09:50,370 --> 01:09:55,370
it should make you sick.
It's so strange and I don't know if 

1668
01:09:55,370 --> 01:09:55,370
there's a way around it.
I don't know how to fix it,

1669
01:09:55,370 --> 01:09:57,710
but it certainly should not apply to 
something as,

1670
01:09:57,711 --> 01:10:00,840
as crazy and transient as a Hollywood 
job.

1671
01:10:00,990 --> 01:10:01,470
The,
the,

1672
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:06,471
the greatest job ever a sitcom job 
because those only last a few years and 

1673
01:10:06,471 --> 01:10:07,290
you usually get one of them your whole 
life,

1674
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:08,280
you know,
I mean,

1675
01:10:08,281 --> 01:10:12,090
it's rare as fuck how I know.
I mean in the Stephen Root situation was

1676
01:10:12,091 --> 01:10:13,360
the same situation.
I mean he just,

1677
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:18,210
he got fucked based on the fact that 
that's when he was making the most money

1678
01:10:18,211 --> 01:10:19,890
and that's when she decided to get and 
was good.

1679
01:10:19,980 --> 01:10:20,340
Yeah.

1680
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:25,600
Letting the old assumption that know 
it's based on an assumption that's 50 

1681
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:28,891
years old,
that women can't take care of 

1682
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:28,891
themselves.
They can't,

1683
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:28,891
you know,
it's true.

1684
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:29,200
You know,
they can't.

1685
01:10:29,740 --> 01:10:30,420
Alright,
right.

1686
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:36,200
Just pray.
Just pray for breast cancer or not 

1687
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:36,930
uncovering this in my standup,
but humorously.

1688
01:10:36,990 --> 01:10:39,630
Wow.
Good luck with that.

1689
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:45,060
Yeah,
I mean I think it's much more difficult 

1690
01:10:45,060 --> 01:10:45,300
for women to take care of themselves,
especially women who have children.

1691
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:46,590
Fucking hardest shit,
man.

1692
01:10:46,850 --> 01:10:48,540
How raising kids,
you know,

1693
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:51,030
people that don't think that it's our 
job to raise kids.

1694
01:10:51,031 --> 01:10:56,031
You never tried to raise kids,
you don't know what you're talking 

1695
01:10:56,031 --> 01:10:56,031
about.
But I,

1696
01:10:56,031 --> 01:10:58,750
I am amazed lot so many people think 
that it's okay or that it's no big deal 

1697
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:01,290
to have a full time job and have 
children.

1698
01:11:01,670 --> 01:11:06,670
Like I have a friend of mine who's 36 
who's still wanting to have kids and 

1699
01:11:06,670 --> 01:11:06,670
she's,
you know,

1700
01:11:06,670 --> 01:11:07,460
thinking that it's not going to 
interrupt her job and I'm like,

1701
01:11:07,470 --> 01:11:08,820
you work eight,
10 hours a day,

1702
01:11:08,821 --> 01:11:12,180
you're fucking crazy.
You're going to have a new human being.

1703
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:14,510
And she's talking this craziness about 
childcare.

1704
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:15,090
I'm like,
listen,

1705
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:20,120
it's an immense,
immense amount of work beyond your 

1706
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:23,210
comprehension and it'll specially if 
you're traveling through Italy or Africa

1707
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:27,150
with just the one nanny,
just one nanny.

1708
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:29,190
Wow.
How could you do that?

1709
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:30,560
I don't know.
She's roughing it.

1710
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:36,200
Wow.
So I don't mean to bum anybody out and 

1711
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:37,540
I'm sorry they already went.
So in depth about the.

1712
01:11:37,541 --> 01:11:38,350
Set it down.
Yeah.

1713
01:11:38,490 --> 01:11:43,490
No,
we're not going to live and we don't 

1714
01:11:43,490 --> 01:11:43,490
edit it.
You know,

1715
01:11:43,490 --> 01:11:46,660
everyone just go by kids in the hall and
DVD support Dave shows.

1716
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:50,010
Does that money go to you?
A small percentage.

1717
01:11:50,011 --> 01:11:53,220
What about the wrong guy?
Because I go to you really well.

1718
01:11:53,270 --> 01:11:55,020
Yeah.
Almost nothing.

1719
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:55,620
Almost.
No,

1720
01:11:55,621 --> 01:11:57,950
I think I just gave you almost nothing.
There you go.

1721
01:11:58,050 --> 01:12:03,050
Yeah.
Well almost like that rarely ever sells 

1722
01:12:03,050 --> 01:12:03,050
a copy.
So.

1723
01:12:03,050 --> 01:12:06,180
So tell me this,
how did you go from doing news radio and

1724
01:12:06,181 --> 01:12:08,310
you had a bunch of pilots that didn't 
take off?

1725
01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:10,020
Well,
how the fuck does that?

1726
01:12:10,021 --> 01:12:12,630
Not How do you not wind up on something 
else?

1727
01:12:12,631 --> 01:12:14,430
How does that not happen?
I don't know.

1728
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:15,400
I did,
I,

1729
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:17,560
you know,
I was in a bunch of pilots,

1730
01:12:17,590 --> 01:12:21,250
other people's pilots that I didn't 
write a and none of those trailers when,

1731
01:12:21,730 --> 01:12:24,130
um,
and then,

1732
01:12:24,131 --> 01:12:25,090
uh,
you know,

1733
01:12:25,091 --> 01:12:30,091
then I also like was,
it was the judge on a thank God you're 

1734
01:12:30,091 --> 01:12:31,750
here with an MBC,
which would've been a good money gig.

1735
01:12:31,810 --> 01:12:36,810
What does that,
it was an Improv show based on 

1736
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:36,810
Australian Improv show.
Oh,

1737
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:38,380
did like seven episodes on,
on NBC.

1738
01:12:38,381 --> 01:12:41,320
But then it got canceled.
This was like during the writers strike.

1739
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:42,970
Um,
so,

1740
01:12:42,971 --> 01:12:43,550
you know,
Oh yeah,

1741
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:44,800
I remember that,
you know,

1742
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:47,770
and you know,
and then they're just becomes,

1743
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:52,800
you know,
the industry is all about perception 

1744
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:52,800
than the perception is just,
Oh,

1745
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:52,800
well,
he's cold.

1746
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:53,710
Ugh.
You know,

1747
01:12:53,740 --> 01:12:55,210
how weird is that?
I don't know.

1748
01:12:55,730 --> 01:12:57,760
I kind of thought there would be a 
problem.

1749
01:12:58,210 --> 01:13:03,210
I mean,
I remember talking to Vicky and saying 

1750
01:13:03,210 --> 01:13:03,210
like,
when news,

1751
01:13:03,210 --> 01:13:03,210
I kept saying when,
well,

1752
01:13:03,210 --> 01:13:07,190
when news radio gets canceled,
I said I'll probably be the hardest for 

1753
01:13:07,190 --> 01:13:07,190
me to get work of anyone else.
Well,

1754
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:12,200
I just think that because I was a first 
in the credits and the show was never a 

1755
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:13,480
hit.
Oh,

1756
01:13:13,481 --> 01:13:15,520
that's interesting.
So that's how they do that.

1757
01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:19,780
Yeah.
So everyone else was a supporting player

1758
01:13:19,930 --> 01:13:23,060
on a critically acclaimed show.
Um,

1759
01:13:24,270 --> 01:13:25,830
but I was the,
you know,

1760
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:30,910
supposedly the lead character on a show 
that wasn't a hit.

1761
01:13:30,911 --> 01:13:32,830
So it'd be,
well he couldn't carry a show.

1762
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:34,760
Wow.
What a weird,

1763
01:13:34,790 --> 01:13:36,530
weird to look at it.
People don't know.

1764
01:13:36,531 --> 01:13:38,960
A lot of people that don't even realize 
news radio wasn't a hit,

1765
01:13:38,961 --> 01:13:41,780
but while we were on the air,
we were on the air.

1766
01:13:41,781 --> 01:13:46,781
We moved nine times,
nine times over the course of five 

1767
01:13:46,781 --> 01:13:46,781
seasons and

1768
01:13:46,781 --> 01:13:48,460
the guy had the head of programming at,
at,

1769
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:51,430
at a scheduling at NBC.
Hated us.

1770
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:52,980
Why was that?
I don't know.

1771
01:13:52,981 --> 01:13:54,280
Remember,
there was that whole thing with,

1772
01:13:54,281 --> 01:13:56,140
uh,
the rolling stone article.

1773
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:56,770
Yes.

1774
01:13:57,790 --> 01:14:00,280
But that was when we were already 
floundering.

1775
01:14:00,340 --> 01:14:01,480
Yeah.
But it was also.

1776
01:14:01,481 --> 01:14:02,650
But the guy,
this guy,

1777
01:14:02,651 --> 01:14:07,651
uh,
but we should tell people what that 

1778
01:14:07,651 --> 01:14:07,651
means.
What's the rolling?

1779
01:14:07,651 --> 01:14:09,970
The rolling start.
Paul Stanley or Paul Stanley Kiss Paul 

1780
01:14:09,970 --> 01:14:11,170
Simms,
who was the creator,

1781
01:14:11,230 --> 01:14:14,050
the show called NBC Thursday night 
lineup,

1782
01:14:14,051 --> 01:14:17,800
which was their big friends lineup.
They called it a shit sandwich.

1783
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:18,970
He called it.
It was really,

1784
01:14:18,971 --> 01:14:23,971
it should have been shit was the button 
because they're real sandwich was 

1785
01:14:23,971 --> 01:14:26,260
friends and then you would have friends 
on and then you would have this terrible

1786
01:14:26,261 --> 01:14:27,170
show.
No,

1787
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:29,530
it was always on after France.
And uh,

1788
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:34,540
you know,
obviously NBC was very upset that Paul 

1789
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:34,990
was calling sex in the city or the 
single guy to pieces of shit,

1790
01:14:35,410 --> 01:14:36,400
but you know,
they were,

1791
01:14:36,401 --> 01:14:41,401
they were terrible shows and then 
friends was brilliant show that 

1792
01:14:41,401 --> 01:14:44,071
everybody tuned into.
So they sort of watch those other shows 

1793
01:14:44,071 --> 01:14:44,071
just because they were on.

1794
01:14:44,071 --> 01:14:48,070
But I guess it got it.
Got Guy gets named Preston Beckmann 

1795
01:14:48,070 --> 01:14:48,070
hated our show.
Even when we did the pilot,

1796
01:14:48,070 --> 01:14:51,971
he didn't want to pick it up really 
because we were originally supposed to 

1797
01:14:51,971 --> 01:14:54,461
get it Thursday slot ourselves.
But this guy who was in charge of the 

1798
01:14:54,461 --> 01:14:55,670
MVC schedule wouldn't let us have it 
Thursday slot.

1799
01:14:55,970 --> 01:14:58,550
So then he basically kept trying to find
a slot that would kill us,

1800
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:02,170
so that's why they put us on a.
We are the lead leading,

1801
01:15:02,310 --> 01:15:07,130
we're,
we're on with wings and fraser a frazier

1802
01:15:07,131 --> 01:15:11,840
and those shows were both doing poorly 
when we came along and he put us on with

1803
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:15,740
those shows and we our show,
we boosted the ratings of both shows.

1804
01:15:16,210 --> 01:15:18,570
Well all of a sudden it became like a 
decent lineup for,

1805
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:21,280
for comedies,
but it was a different time than men.

1806
01:15:21,281 --> 01:15:24,990
There was no dvrs shows,
couldn't exist in a,

1807
01:15:25,010 --> 01:15:30,010
in a non popular spot.
It had to be a spot where people are 

1808
01:15:30,010 --> 01:15:30,010
already looking.

1809
01:15:30,010 --> 01:15:30,010
Well,
the ratings we were getting in those,

1810
01:15:30,010 --> 01:15:34,730
we're getting like 10 million people 
tuning in and those ratings in those 

1811
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:36,240
days were considered a ratings failure.
Like today,

1812
01:15:36,241 --> 01:15:38,580
if you got those ratings here,
the number one show on TV.

1813
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:39,540
Yeah,
it's weird.

1814
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:42,270
There's so many channels now.
At one point in time,

1815
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:47,300
uh,
Lou Martin used to show up at our 

1816
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:50,120
writer's meetings at the,
rather at the run the table read was t 

1817
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:52,590
with a shirt on with a number of 
whatever we were in,

1818
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:55,590
what place we are in and he showed up 
and it was 84.

1819
01:15:55,650 --> 01:15:58,110
Yes,
we're an 84th place.

1820
01:15:58,530 --> 01:15:59,850
And we were like,
what was it,

1821
01:15:59,851 --> 01:16:00,720
84,
88.

1822
01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:02,280
That's when,
when they finally,

1823
01:16:02,310 --> 01:16:07,310
when they put us up against drew Carey,
and then we had Warren littlefield 

1824
01:16:07,310 --> 01:16:09,760
actually came down to a table read to 
let us know that they still loved us.

1825
01:16:10,190 --> 01:16:11,400
They surfaced Turkey dinner.

1826
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:17,200
You never learn a warrant like there was
there carving Turkey and Warren 

1827
01:16:18,010 --> 01:16:18,280
Littlefield,
whatever.

1828
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:23,130
It was a nice guy.
Network head.

1829
01:16:23,150 --> 01:16:24,040
Yeah.
He was very nice.

1830
01:16:24,041 --> 01:16:29,041
This,
I always remember a 95 Warren 

1831
01:16:29,041 --> 01:16:32,760
littlefield dancing on the bar in New 
York at when we went for the upfronts 

1832
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:35,320
and it was like Jay Leno had had just 
hit number was the number one late night

1833
01:16:35,321 --> 01:16:36,240
show.
Wow.

1834
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:41,430
And I'm more.
Warren was standing on this bar doing 

1835
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:41,430
shots and shouting night.

1836
01:16:42,430 --> 01:16:44,810
Oh Wow.
That's hilarious.

1837
01:16:45,130 --> 01:16:48,100
Was that the one where,
which one did you guys get drunk at?

1838
01:16:48,101 --> 01:16:53,101
I didn't go to every event,
but we got kicked out where we weren't 

1839
01:16:53,101 --> 01:16:54,940
allowed to go.
Was it the SAG awards?

1840
01:16:54,941 --> 01:16:57,520
Yeah,
these motherfuckers got so hammered.

1841
01:16:57,670 --> 01:17:00,130
They caused so much damage at the sag 
awards.

1842
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:02,620
We couldn't go anymore.
We weren't allowed to go.

1843
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:05,860
I've still never been back.
Here's a great one.

1844
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:10,040
We were at the Emmy's and this is after 
Phil had been murdered and we're sitting

1845
01:17:10,041 --> 01:17:13,150
there and you know,
Phil was nominated for something and uh,

1846
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,950
the denominations go and I think the guy
from Frasier,

1847
01:17:15,951 --> 01:17:20,951
God,
David Hyde Pierce and Dave turns to me 

1848
01:17:20,951 --> 01:17:20,951
and goes,
what does Phil have to do to win?

1849
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,200
Oh No.
You know,

1850
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:29,870
it was so weird.
It was David.

1851
01:17:30,170 --> 01:17:32,690
David Hyde Pierce looks so embarrassed 
to be winning.

1852
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:38,110
He was literally up there like,
is all the blood drained out of his 

1853
01:17:38,110 --> 01:17:38,110
face?
He was just going,

1854
01:17:38,150 --> 01:17:41,450
well,
obviously I'm Phil Hartman.

1855
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:42,850
You know,
he didn't,

1856
01:17:42,860 --> 01:17:44,630
he couldn't even put a sentence 
together.

1857
01:17:44,631 --> 01:17:45,050
He was,

1858
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:50,200
yeah.
I wonder what the choice behind that 

1859
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:50,200
was.
That was weird.

1860
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:50,200
You know,
don't,

1861
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:54,161
don't kill someone.
And then expect them to win sort of 

1862
01:17:54,161 --> 01:17:54,580
messages.
You're sending out two murders.

1863
01:17:55,030 --> 01:17:58,370
It's cheating,
being murdered as a cheat.

1864
01:17:59,430 --> 01:18:01,280
Oh,
what a strange,

1865
01:18:01,281 --> 01:18:06,281
strange times.
So what did you guys do at the Sag 

1866
01:18:06,281 --> 01:18:06,281
Awards?
That got us kicked out forever?

1867
01:18:06,281 --> 01:18:06,281
No,
I think,

1868
01:18:06,281 --> 01:18:08,080
uh,
most,

1869
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:11,330
uh,
at the time,

1870
01:18:11,331 --> 01:18:13,910
I guess because we all thought what a 
stupid award show,

1871
01:18:14,550 --> 01:18:19,550
you know,
this is the first year of the SAG 

1872
01:18:19,550 --> 01:18:19,550
awards.
Let me say this is ridiculous.

1873
01:18:19,550 --> 01:18:22,570
Why actors voting about each other and 
giving awards,

1874
01:18:22,620 --> 01:18:25,460
those saying who's best,
that's the,

1875
01:18:25,570 --> 01:18:28,610
you know,
our union is deciding who is best and it

1876
01:18:28,611 --> 01:18:29,760
creates this weird,

1877
01:18:30,370 --> 01:18:34,350
this culture of ass kissing and fakery 
yeah,

1878
01:18:34,410 --> 01:18:36,390
they're all like,
what a wonderful project.

1879
01:18:36,740 --> 01:18:38,350
Amazing.
And I think what we do,

1880
01:18:38,370 --> 01:18:40,700
I think Maura and I found where the,
uh,

1881
01:18:40,790 --> 01:18:41,210
the,
uh,

1882
01:18:41,390 --> 01:18:46,390
the service bar was a,
have had like the big industrial 

1883
01:18:46,521 --> 01:18:49,220
corkscrew and everything.
So we've said we're going back there,

1884
01:18:49,221 --> 01:18:54,221
just opening up bottles of wine and 
bringing them up to the table and I 

1885
01:18:54,221 --> 01:18:54,221
think,
you know,

1886
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:57,740
and then we had andy with this to a 
which was.

1887
01:18:58,090 --> 01:19:02,420
So who did want to be doing anything 
notable that got us kicked out?

1888
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:03,460
Uh,
I don't really remember.

1889
01:19:03,470 --> 01:19:07,310
I think we were just noisy and rude and 
stealing.

1890
01:19:07,311 --> 01:19:09,050
We were applauding inappropriately.

1891
01:19:10,050 --> 01:19:10,540
Like,
oh,

1892
01:19:10,580 --> 01:19:11,070
well,
you know,

1893
01:19:11,071 --> 01:19:13,000
there was no malaria medicine back then 
was there,

1894
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:16,870
drink the malaria medicine.
When he took a reporters over,

1895
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:20,220
the reporter came up to him with a tape 
recorder and ask them some questions.

1896
01:19:20,221 --> 01:19:25,221
Dave took his microphone,
stuck it in his drink and then pushed 

1897
01:19:25,221 --> 01:19:27,440
him and that's when we realized like 
Dave was off the tracks together,

1898
01:19:27,450 --> 01:19:29,610
the woods,
it wasn't dave anymore.

1899
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:32,340
And then Dave was fucking screaming at 
this Tony Guy,

1900
01:19:32,341 --> 01:19:35,580
you're fucking up my show and my fucking
people.

1901
01:19:35,581 --> 01:19:36,870
I fucking work.
And I'm like,

1902
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:38,470
oh my God,
I think Dave's going to hit him.

1903
01:19:38,810 --> 01:19:40,660
And I had to get in between them.
I had a,

1904
01:19:41,060 --> 01:19:43,170
I had a corner him at a bar.
Like physically,

1905
01:19:43,171 --> 01:19:46,650
I had a physically cornered dave to keep
him from attacking this other guy.

1906
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:46,910
Yeah,

1907
01:19:49,980 --> 01:19:52,890
but we were always the ones to last to 
leave the bar.

1908
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:55,560
The news radio crew was always last to 
leave the bar.

1909
01:19:55,690 --> 01:19:57,000
Yeah.
I think we had this idea.

1910
01:19:57,030 --> 01:20:01,530
We felt like we were like the punks of 
prime time comedy.

1911
01:20:02,050 --> 01:20:04,740
We were the least bullshitty of that,
you know,

1912
01:20:04,750 --> 01:20:06,970
there's this whole culture,
this actor,

1913
01:20:07,830 --> 01:20:10,530
and it's one of the reasons why I was 
willing to do newsradio afterwards,

1914
01:20:10,531 --> 01:20:13,860
like the thought of working with actual 
actors for five years.

1915
01:20:14,290 --> 01:20:19,290
It's like somehow or another I had 
managed to see the worst case scenario 

1916
01:20:19,290 --> 01:20:22,851
with this hardball and then slip into 
the best case scenario for five years 

1917
01:20:22,851 --> 01:20:27,261
and news radio and then it was like 
auditions and being around real actors 

1918
01:20:27,261 --> 01:20:27,261
again.
I'm like,

1919
01:20:27,261 --> 01:20:30,000
fuck this man.
What are the other Shit I can do?

1920
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:31,500
And he's really.
It was a casper.

1921
01:20:31,501 --> 01:20:34,020
You regularly hear people say,
you know what?

1922
01:20:34,021 --> 01:20:39,021
My joke doesn't work.
We should cut my joke that his joke is 

1923
01:20:39,021 --> 01:20:39,021
the better joke.
Yes.

1924
01:20:39,021 --> 01:20:42,920
All the time.
Know it was really an amazing 

1925
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:45,351
environment and you would also hear,
don't put that pencil in my current 

1926
01:20:46,110 --> 01:20:51,110
things like that.
I mean to say the most fucked up shit 

1927
01:20:51,110 --> 01:20:51,110
ever.
I mean,

1928
01:20:51,110 --> 01:20:51,930
if we were,
do you remember the time we had to.

1929
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:56,100
We actually had to sit down and we,
they played that presentation for us,

1930
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:56,930
all of the,
uh,

1931
01:20:56,950 --> 01:20:58,500
the sex,
sexual harassment.

1932
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:00,270
Oh,
I felt so badly for that person.

1933
01:21:02,550 --> 01:21:07,550
You don't know.
You don't know the group of people 

1934
01:21:07,550 --> 01:21:08,370
you've just walked in front of it was so
ridiculous.

1935
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:13,460
They have to go over this whole thing of
what's appropriate and what's not 

1936
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:13,460
appropriate.
And yeah,

1937
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:17,930
it would have meant basically what it 
cut down about 98 percent of all 

1938
01:21:17,930 --> 01:21:18,990
conversation on our set.
I mean,

1939
01:21:18,991 --> 01:21:20,730
we all just sort of a,
you know,

1940
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:22,710
just made an agreement that we wouldn't 
see each other.

1941
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:24,840
Like,
okay,

1942
01:21:25,150 --> 01:21:26,700
this doesn't,
this doesn't apply.

1943
01:21:26,701 --> 01:21:28,380
Right.
But if anybody wanted to.

1944
01:21:28,381 --> 01:21:30,570
I mean,
there's been many times on sets where,

1945
01:21:30,571 --> 01:21:31,050
uh,
you know,

1946
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:36,080
especially a women actresses feel like 
there's too much of that shit going on 

1947
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:40,250
and they just fucking fuck this.
I'm getting a lawyer and then there's 

1948
01:21:40,250 --> 01:21:40,250
payouts,
man.

1949
01:21:40,250 --> 01:21:41,790
It becomes like a big issue and you make
a lot of money.

1950
01:21:41,791 --> 01:21:43,860
I know because every like you'd have 
andy.

1951
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:46,920
Andy will be sitting there and they got 
us on a step.

1952
01:21:46,921 --> 01:21:51,921
Your pussy leaves the way Vicky wouldn't
be.

1953
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:58,680
Vicky would be laughing.
I remember the very first time I met 

1954
01:21:58,680 --> 01:21:59,880
Andy and again I'd been acting for a 
fucking month.

1955
01:21:59,910 --> 01:22:01,350
Right?
I'd done a new,

1956
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:02,760
a new.
No one liked that.

1957
01:22:02,761 --> 01:22:05,820
I knew up with fighters and pool 
hustlers.

1958
01:22:05,850 --> 01:22:07,920
The.
Those are the two worlds that I was most

1959
01:22:07,921 --> 01:22:10,230
entrenched in and crazy.
Standup comedians.

1960
01:22:10,231 --> 01:22:11,010
They're all nuts.
Right?

1961
01:22:11,310 --> 01:22:15,510
And then all of a sudden I'm in this,
this dressing room with Andy and Andy is

1962
01:22:15,511 --> 01:22:18,540
sitting cross legged and he has clogs 
on,

1963
01:22:18,860 --> 01:22:23,860
okay,
and he's got these weird brown corduroy 

1964
01:22:23,860 --> 01:22:24,090
pants and he's flipping his foot back 
and forth.

1965
01:22:24,091 --> 01:22:25,830
He goes,
do you think you're going to be famous?

1966
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:28,950
I don't know.
What do you think?

1967
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:30,800
Oh yes,
I know I'm going to be.

1968
01:22:31,590 --> 01:22:32,530
Now.
I'm going to be.

1969
01:22:32,730 --> 01:22:35,130
I've already decided I'm going to be so 
famous.

1970
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:36,870
I can't wait.
I can't wait to be really,

1971
01:22:36,871 --> 01:22:41,871
really famous.
Do you think this is gonna be the show 

1972
01:22:41,871 --> 01:22:41,871
for you or maybe not?
I don't know,

1973
01:22:41,871 --> 01:22:42,750
man.
I don't know.

1974
01:22:42,810 --> 01:22:43,830
You're gonna be famous.
Oh,

1975
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,060
absolutely.
So yeah,

1976
01:22:45,530 --> 01:22:47,130
I think it's already happening.
Yeah.

1977
01:22:47,131 --> 01:22:52,131
I think the arc of your friendship with 
Andy was the most interesting of the 

1978
01:22:52,131 --> 01:22:55,281
whole cast.
I'd only wish I hadn't marijuana back 

1979
01:22:55,281 --> 01:22:55,281
then.
Yeah.

1980
01:22:55,281 --> 01:22:59,210
I would've found him so much more 
fascinating because I had testosterone 

1981
01:22:59,210 --> 01:23:00,960
and adrenaline and that was just 
everyday was just don't kill Andi.

1982
01:23:01,370 --> 01:23:06,370
Don't,
don't fucking kill him because he was 

1983
01:23:06,370 --> 01:23:06,370
just so out of control.
I've never

1984
01:23:06,370 --> 01:23:08,050
met someone so out of control,
but on set.

1985
01:23:08,060 --> 01:23:10,910
Nobody enjoyed andy more than you did.
I loved him,

1986
01:23:10,911 --> 01:23:15,911
like doing scenes like joe had so a show
getting through scenes with him because 

1987
01:23:15,911 --> 01:23:18,130
they would laugh.
They would bust you up constantly.

1988
01:23:18,550 --> 01:23:23,550
He's hilarious.
He's one of the funniest human beings 

1989
01:23:23,550 --> 01:23:23,550
I've ever met in my life.
Yeah.

1990
01:23:23,550 --> 01:23:27,450
There's only been.
There's been a few human beings that 

1991
01:23:27,450 --> 01:23:27,450
I've ever met in my life where I was 
like,

1992
01:23:27,450 --> 01:23:27,790
wow,
what a fucking original.

1993
01:23:28,070 --> 01:23:33,070
Yeah.
Joey Diaz is one of them and Andy Dick 

1994
01:23:33,070 --> 01:23:33,070
is one of them don't always funnier than
Andy,

1995
01:23:33,070 --> 01:23:36,040
but he's a standup but Andy fucking 
Christ,

1996
01:23:36,041 --> 01:23:38,980
he was funny and there's no doubt he's 
talented is so weird,

1997
01:23:39,010 --> 01:23:44,010
but it needs to be handled.
Andy's one of those guys that needs a 

1998
01:23:44,010 --> 01:23:47,791
Paul Simms and crew behind him,
right for them and you put them in the 

1999
01:23:47,791 --> 01:23:49,060
end and he's Goddamn gold and after that
was over,

2000
01:23:49,061 --> 01:23:54,061
I was like,
I was no one grabbing him and doing 

2001
01:23:54,061 --> 01:23:54,061
another one of these.

2002
01:23:54,061 --> 01:23:55,360
Instead he went and done did that MTV 
show,

2003
01:23:55,361 --> 01:24:00,361
which was so bizarre for few years on a.
was it less than perfect or wasn't used 

2004
01:24:01,010 --> 01:24:06,010
on that front?
I hadn't met even been as long as news 

2005
01:24:06,010 --> 01:24:08,401
radio.
Now he's like living in a garage 

2006
01:24:08,401 --> 01:24:11,281
somewhere.
It's not on his own property was ex 

2007
01:24:11,281 --> 01:24:14,600
wives.
I heard a story about him the other day 

2008
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:17,761
where he went to like my friend lives in
this apartment building where it's just 

2009
01:24:17,761 --> 01:24:17,761
like,
you know,

2010
01:24:17,761 --> 01:24:22,301
like the courtyards in the middle and 
they heard all these people yelling at 

2011
01:24:22,301 --> 01:24:22,301
like 1:00
AM.

2012
01:24:22,301 --> 01:24:26,221
They look outside and I guess Andy was 
just like screaming like I need a beer 

2013
01:24:26,221 --> 01:24:27,430
and some guy upstairs is like,
hey,

2014
01:24:27,820 --> 01:24:29,290
are you Andy Dick?
And then he was like,

2015
01:24:29,291 --> 01:24:30,040
yeah.
And he's like,

2016
01:24:30,070 --> 01:24:35,070
we got beer up here man.
And say he just came up there and party 

2017
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:37,501
until like 4:00
AM with these strangers in this 

2018
01:24:37,501 --> 01:24:37,501
apartment.

2019
01:24:37,501 --> 01:24:38,350
So it sounds like an ending.
I got a text recently,

2020
01:24:38,351 --> 01:24:40,060
I was like asleep.
Thank God.

2021
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:44,800
And then I woke up and I just got this 
text from a friend said that Andy was in

2022
01:24:44,801 --> 01:24:47,050
the bar downstairs from where my 
apartment is,

2023
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:52,420
just said,
Andy Dick is here and he's making a 

2024
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:53,150
complete ass of himself.
And he had,

2025
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:55,270
he was like running through the 
restaurant.

2026
01:24:55,330 --> 01:24:58,990
He was like grabbing the waitresses tits
and he was like a go,

2027
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:03,430
like stealing food off people's plates.
And a one point he apparently he crawled

2028
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:08,431
under all the tables and was knocking 
tables over and then he went into the 

2029
01:25:08,431 --> 01:25:09,540
kitchen and tried to make out with uh,
you know,

2030
01:25:09,541 --> 01:25:11,880
the dishwasher,
you know,

2031
01:25:13,950 --> 01:25:15,270
how is he in jail?
Yeah,

2032
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:16,750
how has it been?
Rested?

2033
01:25:16,751 --> 01:25:21,751
A lot.
But I do a joke about it in my act 

2034
01:25:21,751 --> 01:25:21,751
because it's so ridiculous.

2035
01:25:21,751 --> 01:25:22,060
People go,
keep believe Andy did get arrested.

2036
01:25:22,290 --> 01:25:27,290
I'm like,
I can't believe he doesn't get a 

2037
01:25:27,290 --> 01:25:28,471
resident every day a day that goes by 
where he's not arrested in like you 

2038
01:25:28,471 --> 01:25:31,831
could have a TV show called let's get 
any dick arrested and this is what it 

2039
01:25:31,831 --> 01:25:34,471
would be just everyday you show up 
because he is committing a felony 

2040
01:25:34,471 --> 01:25:35,470
everyday.
Probably poor fucking guy.

2041
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:36,970
But you know,
he needs to be handled.

2042
01:25:36,971 --> 01:25:39,460
But even if he's handled,
he's going to go out of control now.

2043
01:25:39,461 --> 01:25:44,461
I mean that that's again,
I think news radio is such a good place 

2044
01:25:44,461 --> 01:25:45,640
for him because none of us really would 
take any shit from him that yes.

2045
01:25:45,641 --> 01:25:49,000
And also because he never became famous 
from that show.

2046
01:25:49,090 --> 01:25:54,090
Yeah.
It was always floundering and it never 

2047
01:25:54,090 --> 01:25:54,090
really became a hit after it was in 
syndication.

2048
01:25:54,090 --> 01:25:56,410
That's when it began.
But there were some moments,

2049
01:25:56,411 --> 01:25:58,570
there were some moments where Andy tried
to get crazy,

2050
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:00,280
you know,
and especially,

2051
01:26:00,281 --> 01:26:03,290
you know,
he would try not to pay attention or try

2052
01:26:03,291 --> 01:26:03,680
to,
you know,

2053
01:26:03,681 --> 01:26:08,681
force extra attention on himself or 
still delaying things are fucking up 

2054
01:26:08,681 --> 01:26:11,960
rehearsals or card game to show up on 
this.

2055
01:26:12,910 --> 01:26:17,360
His son on the set when he left,
drove home and forgot his fucking kid.

2056
01:26:17,750 --> 01:26:18,860
It sent this comedy now,
right?

2057
01:26:18,861 --> 01:26:19,420
Yeah.
Look,

2058
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:23,570
I think I saw him the other day at an 
open mic or give the poor kid a hug.

2059
01:26:23,870 --> 01:26:26,090
Yeah.
I got some,

2060
01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:31,160
actually did improv with Andy at Improv 
Olympic io io.

2061
01:26:31,161 --> 01:26:33,770
They call an outback was back when he 
had the ankle bracelet on.

2062
01:26:33,771 --> 01:26:35,830
So he was sober and he was like,
I,

2063
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:37,040
you know,
it's like,

2064
01:26:37,041 --> 01:26:37,640
it's gone.
Wow.

2065
01:26:37,641 --> 01:26:39,200
It's weird.
Andy,

2066
01:26:39,201 --> 01:26:44,201
I don't know.
It's weird to be around you when you're 

2067
01:26:44,201 --> 01:26:44,201
now when he's not fucked up.
Yeah.

2068
01:26:44,201 --> 01:26:45,200
Last time I saw him,
he was sober.

2069
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:47,750
He came up to the company or to the 
Improv rather?

2070
01:26:47,940 --> 01:26:49,300
Yeah.
Took a picture of him.

2071
01:26:49,620 --> 01:26:50,930
I wasn't really.
I've always said with any of those,

2072
01:26:50,931 --> 01:26:55,931
and I never really understood why he 
needs so much drugs and booze because I 

2073
01:26:55,931 --> 01:26:57,040
don't know what inhibitions he's trying 
to release was.

2074
01:26:57,040 --> 01:27:02,040
That's not what it is.
He's trying to quell the demons of his 

2075
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:02,040
past memories.
And,

2076
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:03,110
and I had a long conversation about,
uh,

2077
01:27:03,111 --> 01:27:05,540
once we told me he doesn't remember 
anything from age,

2078
01:27:05,541 --> 01:27:08,510
like eight or nine on anything earlier 
than that.

2079
01:27:08,810 --> 01:27:09,910
He doesn't remember it.
He doesn't,

2080
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:11,810
he literally doesn't remember his 
childhood,

2081
01:27:12,150 --> 01:27:17,150
his,
no recollection because it was horribly 

2082
01:27:17,150 --> 01:27:17,150
traumatic.
He doesn't know his parents.

2083
01:27:17,150 --> 01:27:17,150
I mean,
he,

2084
01:27:17,150 --> 01:27:18,680
I think he met them after he became 
famous.

2085
01:27:18,750 --> 01:27:20,510
Yeah,
he's been in the last few years.

2086
01:27:20,511 --> 01:27:22,400
It was ugly.
Whatever the fuck happened to him,

2087
01:27:22,401 --> 01:27:24,230
you're not going to get the street 
straight story from him,

2088
01:27:24,231 --> 01:27:28,020
but you don't make an Andy Dick with 
love and attention and you know,

2089
01:27:28,130 --> 01:27:32,150
you only make one of those fucking 
horrible amounts of neglect.

2090
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:34,980
Yeah.
Unfortunately it was an evil Japan,

2091
01:27:35,450 --> 01:27:40,450
Andy Dick.
But it's funny how it works that way 

2092
01:27:40,450 --> 01:27:40,830
when you have to have some sort of a 
fucked up life to,

2093
01:27:40,870 --> 01:27:43,610
to make a really,
truly brilliantly funny person.

2094
01:27:43,770 --> 01:27:46,580
And like everyone that I know Joe was 
going to say,

2095
01:27:46,581 --> 01:27:47,880
I usually say that the,
the,

2096
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:52,960
the childhood background for Comedians 
is basically the same as porn stars 

2097
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:54,830
because it is convenience.
Don't usually have the abs for porn.

2098
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:58,500
You of course go against that.
The rule.

2099
01:27:58,501 --> 01:28:02,060
I fuck up the whole room.
So you could do porn you've wanted to to

2100
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:03,620
that.
Yeah.

2101
01:28:04,010 --> 01:28:05,480
Back when there was money and then I 
thought about it.

2102
01:28:05,540 --> 01:28:07,480
Yeah.
I know.

2103
01:28:07,620 --> 01:28:09,380
Announcer,
discipline my way out of Hollywood.

2104
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:12,430
Fucking do a porno and make millions.
Yeah.

2105
01:28:12,490 --> 01:28:13,790
So you have thought about directing 
porn.

2106
01:28:13,791 --> 01:28:14,630
Really have it?
Yeah.

2107
01:28:14,690 --> 01:28:16,650
Do you remember the guy on news radio?
Um,

2108
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:21,720
I do not remember his name,
but he was a writer that also wrote for 

2109
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:21,720
porn.
Do you know,

2110
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:25,190
season one because I was living in north
Hollywood at the time and um,

2111
01:28:25,310 --> 01:28:28,760
he took me to a set and it was a telling
you,

2112
01:28:29,060 --> 01:28:30,470
Kelly and Jeanine.

2113
01:28:30,470 --> 01:28:31,280
Yeah.
We went to a,

2114
01:28:31,340 --> 01:28:36,340
a lesbian shoot.
And it was back in the vivid days when 

2115
01:28:36,340 --> 01:28:36,620
they were making a ton of money because 
they were selling vhs tapes.

2116
01:28:36,621 --> 01:28:41,621
Okay.
They weren't even selling dvds back 

2117
01:28:41,621 --> 01:28:41,621
then.
It was [inaudible] 94.

2118
01:28:41,621 --> 01:28:44,921
Right.
So we went to the set and it was so 

2119
01:28:44,921 --> 01:28:47,660
oddly clinical and weird.
And the girl Janine,

2120
01:28:47,661 --> 01:28:50,540
who wound up marrying Jesse James and 
having kids with them.

2121
01:28:50,690 --> 01:28:53,540
That was a woman and she'd kept going,
I love my job.

2122
01:28:53,780 --> 01:28:56,990
I love my job.
Her job was in eating pussy.

2123
01:28:56,991 --> 01:28:58,480
It was just so weird.
No,

2124
01:28:58,490 --> 01:28:59,460
wait a minute.
I would love that.

2125
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:03,030
I would love that.
Currently causes cancer.

2126
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:04,650
That's definitely A.
Yeah.

2127
01:29:05,020 --> 01:29:07,350
If you get cancer meeting pussy,
you're a pussy.

2128
01:29:07,750 --> 01:29:12,750
It's annoying though,
but if I'm going to get mouth cancer 

2129
01:29:12,750 --> 01:29:12,810
rather yet from,
from,

2130
01:29:12,900 --> 01:29:13,590
from,
you know,

2131
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:18,600
looking to push you then transfer back 
pack spitting in a cup where they're 

2132
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:22,701
also saying now that the coloring and 
Coca Cola is causing cancer now and 

2133
01:29:23,511 --> 01:29:23,640
then.

2134
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:26,310
Or they're thinking about why do they 
need to call her coke?

2135
01:29:26,370 --> 01:29:31,370
Can it just be clear and tastes like 
that didn't really give a fuck what it 

2136
01:29:31,370 --> 01:29:31,370
looks like.
Great.

2137
01:29:31,370 --> 01:29:32,130
And my favorite thing is to drink a coca
cola,

2138
01:29:32,150 --> 01:29:33,100
have a pussy.
Right.

2139
01:29:33,290 --> 01:29:37,860
So I'm fucked.
Now why do I even get out of bed?

2140
01:29:38,670 --> 01:29:39,720
It's over.
You know.

2141
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:45,500
So um.
So Andy Dick stays out of jail somehow 

2142
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:46,270
or another.
And occasionally.

2143
01:29:46,650 --> 01:29:48,960
Yeah.
Does that pussy cancer thing,

2144
01:29:48,961 --> 01:29:53,961
by the way,
does that same one on ass or is it just 

2145
01:29:53,961 --> 01:29:54,550
like the pussy?
Because it's the Pamplona.

2146
01:29:55,230 --> 01:29:57,120
Pamplona in Spain.
Pimp.

2147
01:29:57,210 --> 01:29:58,780
What's the name of the virus?
Poloma.

2148
01:29:58,830 --> 01:30:00,000
Yeah.
Something like that.

2149
01:30:01,470 --> 01:30:06,470
That virus is,
they've that can give you a mouth 

2150
01:30:06,470 --> 01:30:06,470
cancer.
Wow.

2151
01:30:06,540 --> 01:30:08,070
That's crazy shit dude.
Yeah,

2152
01:30:08,670 --> 01:30:13,670
I had a wart on my lip.
I got a wart on my lip from the comedy 

2153
01:30:13,670 --> 01:30:14,010
store because the microphone and the 
comments dorm.

2154
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:19,040
I know this what it's from,
from talking to people that you know 

2155
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:21,620
from all these different guys use it 
because there's a certain spot or the 

2156
01:30:21,620 --> 01:30:25,221
microphone would always touch my lip.
I'd always have the microphone right 

2157
01:30:25,221 --> 01:30:28,101
here in my lip and all of a sudden I 
started getting this fucking growth on 

2158
01:30:28,101 --> 01:30:28,101
my lip.
Yeah.

2159
01:30:28,101 --> 01:30:31,850
What is this?
And I went to a dermatologist and they 

2160
01:30:31,850 --> 01:30:32,730
said it was a warrant and they burned a 
fucking wart off my lip.

2161
01:30:33,090 --> 01:30:38,090
That's disgusting.
Disgusting from the fucking comedy 

2162
01:30:38,090 --> 01:30:41,271
store.
Thank God I never came back in that 

2163
01:30:41,271 --> 01:30:41,271
spot.
The exact spot right here.

2164
01:30:41,271 --> 01:30:43,530
If you take up wipes now.
Wipes now accepting white.

2165
01:30:43,550 --> 01:30:44,250
But no.
You know what?

2166
01:30:44,251 --> 01:30:48,300
I really got into probiotics.
I really got into probiotics and I eat a

2167
01:30:48,301 --> 01:30:51,720
lot of acidophilus and I drink a lot of 
Kombucha tea.

2168
01:30:52,260 --> 01:30:57,260
And when I started reading about it that
acidophilus is one of the most 

2169
01:30:57,260 --> 01:31:00,591
aggressive bacteria is healthy bacteria 
is and that it really is an excellent 

2170
01:31:00,591 --> 01:31:00,870
aid in.

2171
01:31:00,930 --> 01:31:03,540
It kills other bacteria that it comes in
contact with.

2172
01:31:03,570 --> 01:31:07,710
So it literally coach your skin so it's 
on top of your skin.

2173
01:31:07,711 --> 01:31:12,180
So if any cold bacteria or any virus,
bacteria tries to fuck with you,

2174
01:31:12,210 --> 01:31:17,210
it attacks it.
That's really like having your own 

2175
01:31:17,210 --> 01:31:18,870
healthy soldiers that live in your body.
And when I was not doing that,

2176
01:31:18,871 --> 01:31:23,550
because sounds like soldiers in a good 
way,

2177
01:31:24,340 --> 01:31:29,340
but when I wasn't doing it when I was 
traveling a lot for the UFC and for 

2178
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:29,400
comedy,
I'm traveling all the time.

2179
01:31:29,401 --> 01:31:34,401
I was getting sick all the time and as 
soon as I really got on the Kombucha 

2180
01:31:34,401 --> 01:31:34,401
tea,
it killed it.

2181
01:31:34,401 --> 01:31:34,830
I stopped,
I stopped getting sick.

2182
01:31:35,190 --> 01:31:40,190
Yeah.
I should try and learn to the stomach 

2183
01:31:40,190 --> 01:31:40,190
that stuff.
Kombucha.

2184
01:31:40,190 --> 01:31:41,880
You don't like it?
It just tastes like vinegar.

2185
01:31:42,030 --> 01:31:44,510
Yeah,
I enjoy it.

2186
01:31:44,620 --> 01:31:46,530
Well remember it was the.
Andy was into Kombucha.

2187
01:31:46,910 --> 01:31:51,910
Yeah.
And it got me into it that he was 

2188
01:31:51,910 --> 01:31:51,910
listening to that weird garlic diet.
Remember he would eat them.

2189
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:53,520
Whole cloves of garlic.
Yeah.

2190
01:31:53,750 --> 01:31:58,750
And it just smells so bad.
The weird thing about andy was he would 

2191
01:31:58,750 --> 01:32:02,541
do massive amounts of drugs.
He would also take like every urban 

2192
01:32:02,541 --> 01:32:06,211
known to man.
He would have like the sorting is 

2193
01:32:06,211 --> 01:32:06,211
vitamins all day.
It was incredible.

2194
01:32:06,211 --> 01:32:08,290
It's like what?
You're so such a contradiction,

2195
01:32:08,291 --> 01:32:11,380
you're so into health and you know,
and worried about,

2196
01:32:11,381 --> 01:32:16,381
you know,
all these antioxidants that you're 

2197
01:32:16,381 --> 01:32:16,381
taking in and have fresh wheat grass 
juice and all this,

2198
01:32:16,381 --> 01:32:17,320
but then you're just doing heroin.

2199
01:32:19,450 --> 01:32:21,550
He was trying to combat the,
the drugs,

2200
01:32:21,590 --> 01:32:26,590
you know,
it's very sad at that dude wind up in a 

2201
01:32:26,590 --> 01:32:28,470
shed somewhere.
He was doing comedy for a while.

2202
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:30,610
I'd hear these crazy fucking stories.
Yeah.

2203
01:32:30,611 --> 01:32:34,760
He was telling me yesterday he kept was 
pulling his residence down and yeah,

2204
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:37,290
we got to get them on the podcast.
No,

2205
01:32:37,930 --> 01:32:39,550
I can't have.
Andy knows where I live.

2206
01:32:39,610 --> 01:32:41,020
We can do that.
We'll do that.

2207
01:32:41,021 --> 01:32:43,720
My students will do it a year now and 
he's gonna know where you live,

2208
01:32:43,721 --> 01:32:44,420
man.
That's all right.

2209
01:32:44,580 --> 01:32:46,930
Be prepared.
Be prepared for that 3:00

2210
01:32:46,930 --> 01:32:51,930
AM knocking the door and let me.
And if I live too far away from 

2211
01:32:51,930 --> 01:32:53,210
Hollywood a,
you'll never be able to walk back.

2212
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:59,160
I can I guess.
But my emotional attachment though to 

2213
01:32:59,160 --> 01:33:00,700
these radios that is fucked up as he is,
he'll always,

2214
01:33:00,730 --> 01:33:02,890
I'll always consider him to be family.
Yes.

2215
01:33:02,920 --> 01:33:04,290
You know,
like everyone from news radio,

2216
01:33:04,291 --> 01:33:06,460
I always considered to me everyone from 
these radios,

2217
01:33:07,020 --> 01:33:08,620
you know,
his family to me,

2218
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:10,360
you know?
Yeah,

2219
01:33:10,450 --> 01:33:11,480
no doubt.
And it's,

2220
01:33:11,481 --> 01:33:16,481
it's,
it's a very unusual bond that we all 

2221
01:33:16,481 --> 01:33:18,721
have.
Stephen root called me awhile back for 

2222
01:33:18,721 --> 01:33:18,721
some party that was thrown and I 
couldn't make it.

2223
01:33:18,721 --> 01:33:19,810
I was going out of town,
but I was like,

2224
01:33:19,811 --> 01:33:24,811
wow,
how good is it to talk to this guy 

2225
01:33:24,811 --> 01:33:26,461
again?
It feels like sometimes we won't see 

2226
01:33:26,461 --> 01:33:26,461
each other for years,
you know,

2227
01:33:26,461 --> 01:33:26,461
but it's like,
but it never feels like.

2228
01:33:26,790 --> 01:33:28,240
But whenever I see anyone from news 
radio,

2229
01:33:28,241 --> 01:33:29,790
it doesn't feel like any time has 
passed,

2230
01:33:30,310 --> 01:33:31,060
you know,
dude,

2231
01:33:31,061 --> 01:33:33,600
you should fucking write something man.
Put it together.

2232
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:37,120
May Be the real producer of a show and 
get everybody to go together again.

2233
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:38,650
Even the,
even andy,

2234
01:33:38,651 --> 01:33:40,510
maybe that's the rescue.
Andy.

2235
01:33:40,650 --> 01:33:42,420
Yeah,
dude names ready?

2236
01:33:42,440 --> 01:33:43,900
But podcasting.
Yeah.

2237
01:33:43,901 --> 01:33:46,840
Well there was one time when we were uh,
we were talking about doing something.

2238
01:33:46,841 --> 01:33:51,841
We were on the set.
It was when Brian Cowen played my 

2239
01:33:51,841 --> 01:33:51,850
brother and we were talking about doing 
something and you're doing it.

2240
01:33:51,851 --> 01:33:53,900
And we actually had,
but it's been over there.

2241
01:33:53,910 --> 01:33:54,670
Yeah,
the uh,

2242
01:33:54,671 --> 01:33:55,720
the Pirelli brothers.
Yeah.

2243
01:33:55,721 --> 01:34:00,190
But we never want them doing anything,
which is always how it's like Joey.

2244
01:34:01,090 --> 01:34:02,260
But like doing,
uh,

2245
01:34:02,261 --> 01:34:05,530
using the.
I remember with Brad Isaac segment using

2246
01:34:05,531 --> 01:34:08,890
the news radio cast as like the mercury 
theater players,

2247
01:34:08,891 --> 01:34:13,891
you know,
like a repertory acting ensemble that 

2248
01:34:13,891 --> 01:34:13,891
you would just like do like,
you know,

2249
01:34:13,891 --> 01:34:15,380
just do like a,
like independent movies would.

2250
01:34:15,580 --> 01:34:18,470
But it would only be the cast of news 
radio and all these different movies.

2251
01:34:19,940 --> 01:34:22,360
That would have been a lot of fun.
We totally should have done a news radio

2252
01:34:22,361 --> 01:34:24,250
movie though,
but it was never like.

2253
01:34:24,410 --> 01:34:26,090
Because I said well it really wasn't 
successful.

2254
01:34:26,470 --> 01:34:28,180
Canceled every season,
every season.

2255
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:30,310
And that's what we kept doing season 
finale.

2256
01:34:30,350 --> 01:34:35,350
We kept doing series finales.
So at the end of every season there 

2257
01:34:35,350 --> 01:34:35,350
were,
there were so crazy like the space one,

2258
01:34:35,420 --> 01:34:36,820
we do these,
the titanic one,

2259
01:34:36,830 --> 01:34:41,830
we did a titanic,
won the whole episode of the show took 

2260
01:34:41,830 --> 01:34:42,750
place in a boat.
So we were like underwater.

2261
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:43,710
Like I,
at the end of the day,

2262
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:48,750
if I had a dive underwater and I have a,
I remember I said that I brought my 

2263
01:34:48,750 --> 01:34:53,011
three d stereo cameras to that.
She had this great three d photo of you 

2264
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:55,270
in the break room set that was in the 
swimming pool,

2265
01:34:55,660 --> 01:34:58,020
a lake with up to here and this,
the

2266
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:03,040
water spraying past you trying to fix 
this really cool photo.

2267
01:35:05,270 --> 01:35:06,040
Yeah,
no kidding.

2268
01:35:06,041 --> 01:35:07,340
Can you email it to me?
Does it work?

2269
01:35:07,341 --> 01:35:08,670
Like.
Yeah,

2270
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:09,280
I could probably,
yeah,

2271
01:35:09,281 --> 01:35:10,550
could probably scan it and then you'd 
have,

2272
01:35:10,870 --> 01:35:13,550
I get scattered is like two side by side
images.

2273
01:35:13,810 --> 01:35:16,960
You went from that.
You started doing the poker show,

2274
01:35:17,030 --> 01:35:17,940
you know,
and you did a,

2275
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:22,960
you try to do a bunch of pilots and then
you decided recently to start doing 

2276
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:22,960
standup.

2277
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:28,440
Yeah,
well actually right after I got the 

2278
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:28,440
court ruling,
uh,

2279
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:28,440
I thought,
oh,

2280
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:28,790
you know,
I don't have any,

2281
01:35:28,850 --> 01:35:29,520
you know,
I'm not,

2282
01:35:30,490 --> 01:35:35,490
I'm not making much money these days.
I'm still making a decent living but not

2283
01:35:35,630 --> 01:35:40,630
when you have to pay $17,000
a month and about a quarter of what I 

2284
01:35:40,630 --> 01:35:44,801
need to earn to be broke.
So I figured well,

2285
01:35:45,080 --> 01:35:47,390
you know,
maybe stand up at least I can go out and

2286
01:35:47,540 --> 01:35:51,440
you know,
and if I can put an act together and you

2287
01:35:51,441 --> 01:35:52,640
know,
if somebody told me,

2288
01:35:52,650 --> 01:35:53,960
said,
well if you got some TV,

2289
01:35:53,990 --> 01:35:58,990
if you've got,
if you've got some name recognition for 

2290
01:35:58,990 --> 01:36:01,221
being on tv,
you can go out and do standup and make 

2291
01:36:01,221 --> 01:36:01,221
money,
you know.

2292
01:36:01,221 --> 01:36:01,221
And I said,
well,

2293
01:36:01,221 --> 01:36:05,831
you know,
I guess you could say you don't even 

2294
01:36:05,831 --> 01:36:05,831
have to be good.
You just,

2295
01:36:05,831 --> 01:36:05,831
you know,
people come after a little while.

2296
01:36:05,831 --> 01:36:07,840
People will stop showing up to.

2297
01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:08,540
But I thought,
well,

2298
01:36:08,541 --> 01:36:11,120
all right,
well I'll see what I'll see if I can get

2299
01:36:11,121 --> 01:36:14,000
the word gets out quicker today than it 
ever has before.

2300
01:36:14,001 --> 01:36:17,150
Like screech really couldn't have pulled
it off if he started out today.

2301
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:18,170
Yeah,
yeah.

2302
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:19,760
Back in the day.
Yeah,

2303
01:36:19,761 --> 01:36:21,140
we got to tour.
But Steve,

2304
01:36:21,160 --> 01:36:23,630
I was doing pretty good though.
He's just got thrown on stage,

2305
01:36:23,631 --> 01:36:24,830
but I bet he's funny.
Yeah,

2306
01:36:24,890 --> 01:36:27,410
it's pretty crazy.
Did you throw yourself right on stage or

2307
01:36:27,411 --> 01:36:29,400
did you kind of do like A.
I don't know,

2308
01:36:29,401 --> 01:36:33,450
like small places first was doing that.
Now I'm still working up the AG.

2309
01:36:33,451 --> 01:36:35,820
I'm not going out and playing.
How long you been doing that?

2310
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:37,160
Since before Christmas.

2311
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:42,200
And you told me Friday night when I 
talked to you that you were going to do 

2312
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:42,200
40 minutes?

2313
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:42,200
I did a,
yeah,

2314
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:44,620
just set it a UCB.
I did.

2315
01:36:44,710 --> 01:36:46,890
I guess I did almost 50 minutes.
Wow.

2316
01:36:46,900 --> 01:36:50,110
And for how long you been doing comedy?
Since December.

2317
01:36:50,111 --> 01:36:51,220
Before Christmas?
Yeah.

2318
01:36:51,221 --> 01:36:53,230
So just a few months.
A few months.

2319
01:36:53,231 --> 01:36:55,210
And you did 40 fucking minutes or an 
hour?

2320
01:36:55,250 --> 01:36:56,970
Almost less than it did before.
You did above?

2321
01:36:56,990 --> 01:36:58,870
I think they said between 45 and 50 
minutes.

2322
01:36:58,900 --> 01:37:00,400
Holy Shit Dude.
That's incredible.

2323
01:37:00,401 --> 01:37:05,401
Yeah.
So are you just doing math and writing 

2324
01:37:05,401 --> 01:37:05,401
constantly?
Like.

2325
01:37:05,401 --> 01:37:09,300
No,
it's just like I kept going down and 

2326
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:10,330
doing like doing some sets of place near
my house,

2327
01:37:10,360 --> 01:37:15,360
my apartment and bunch of other like 
these sort of alternative comedy shows 

2328
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:17,440
downtown.
And just sort of saying,

2329
01:37:17,441 --> 01:37:18,280
well,
you know,

2330
01:37:18,580 --> 01:37:22,030
every time I get up I'll do a do like 20
minutes of new stuff.

2331
01:37:22,380 --> 01:37:23,590
Wow.
Wow.

2332
01:37:23,591 --> 01:37:26,110
So I'll try and rate 20 minutes and new 
stuff for each time I get up.

2333
01:37:26,450 --> 01:37:28,340
Now when you write,
do you,

2334
01:37:28,341 --> 01:37:29,900
um,
do you sit down and go,

2335
01:37:29,901 --> 01:37:31,070
okay,
today I'm going to write,

2336
01:37:31,071 --> 01:37:36,071
stand up.
And do you just like go through the 

2337
01:37:36,071 --> 01:37:36,890
newspaper or do you have some ideas that
you've already developed or

2338
01:37:37,540 --> 01:37:38,410
considered?
Rather?

2339
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:40,110
It'd be Kinda like,
just I,

2340
01:37:40,260 --> 01:37:45,260
uh,
I actually started like make keeping a 

2341
01:37:45,260 --> 01:37:47,251
few notes as,
as like going through the day or also 

2342
01:37:47,251 --> 01:37:47,650
just keeping ideas in my head for 
something that I thought might be funny.

2343
01:37:48,090 --> 01:37:53,090
Uh,
sometimes it would be something that 

2344
01:37:53,090 --> 01:37:53,090
came up in the news,
you know?

2345
01:37:53,090 --> 01:37:54,110
Um,
uh,

2346
01:37:54,280 --> 01:37:55,950
you know,
it's weird,

2347
01:37:56,370 --> 01:37:57,020
but I wouldn't,
I,

2348
01:37:57,070 --> 01:38:01,590
I kind of decided that it wasn't going 
to do what I did when I was a kid.

2349
01:38:01,591 --> 01:38:03,420
I was going to write stuff out word for 
word.

2350
01:38:03,421 --> 01:38:06,160
I was just kinda like have ideas about 
things that are.

2351
01:38:06,630 --> 01:38:09,960
Areas that I thought were funny.
Think it through in my head about what,

2352
01:38:10,020 --> 01:38:13,680
what I would want to cover A.
I have some jokes in my head,

2353
01:38:14,380 --> 01:38:15,710
uh,
and I'd make notes,

2354
01:38:15,711 --> 01:38:20,711
sort of point form notes.
I wouldn't let myself write out the 

2355
01:38:20,711 --> 01:38:21,420
jokes in whole,
just point for form and,

2356
01:38:21,421 --> 01:38:26,421
uh,
to try and keep it from feeling like I 

2357
01:38:26,421 --> 01:38:28,431
was like reading a monologue,
the acting like,

2358
01:38:28,610 --> 01:38:30,090
you know,
I didn't want it to feel like acting.

2359
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:32,280
Yeah.
That is the trick of comedy.

2360
01:38:32,370 --> 01:38:35,430
Um,
I very rarely write out jokes in like,

2361
01:38:35,460 --> 01:38:37,500
you know,
so the other day I'm at the zoo.

2362
01:38:37,550 --> 01:38:39,510
I very rarely do that.
I mean I'm,

2363
01:38:39,560 --> 01:38:42,600
I'm almost never.
Every now and then I do it as a goof,

2364
01:38:42,601 --> 01:38:44,040
like,
as a practice,

2365
01:38:44,250 --> 01:38:46,050
like I'll sit and instead of.
Right,

2366
01:38:46,051 --> 01:38:48,120
just writing,
just random,

2367
01:38:48,330 --> 01:38:49,410
I'll sit and go,
okay,

2368
01:38:49,411 --> 01:38:51,420
I'm going to try to write a bit.
And I've done it.

2369
01:38:51,421 --> 01:38:54,210
I've done it a few times,
but most of the time I just write,

2370
01:38:54,211 --> 01:38:59,211
I just sit down and I write for.
And a lot of it might be depressing and 

2371
01:38:59,211 --> 01:39:03,030
apocalyptic and then there'll be one 
fucking one paragraph chunk.

2372
01:39:03,031 --> 01:39:03,660
And I'm like,
Holy Shit,

2373
01:39:03,661 --> 01:39:04,890
that's a bit,
you know,

2374
01:39:05,250 --> 01:39:08,790
3000 words or here's this one paragraph 
that I bet that's a bit,

2375
01:39:09,140 --> 01:39:10,580
you know.
So do you do,

2376
01:39:10,590 --> 01:39:15,590
do that?
They do just write randomly or do you 

2377
01:39:15,590 --> 01:39:18,051
write like specific?
Like how do you like when you sit down 

2378
01:39:18,051 --> 01:39:18,250
to write?
Um,

2379
01:39:18,630 --> 01:39:21,110
I guess I'm wearing that just a.

2380
01:39:22,770 --> 01:39:24,030
A lot of times the,
the,

2381
01:39:24,160 --> 01:39:29,160
the German fit will be just something 
that I've said like in conversation all 

2382
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:30,300
the time.
I do that to something else.

2383
01:39:30,550 --> 01:39:31,210
Somebody says,
man,

2384
01:39:31,220 --> 01:39:32,280
all start,
I'll go off on.

2385
01:39:32,281 --> 01:39:33,930
I'll go off for a few minutes on 
something.

2386
01:39:33,990 --> 01:39:35,040
And I go,
well that's funny.

2387
01:39:35,130 --> 01:39:36,630
Yeah,
I can work that into something.

2388
01:39:36,810 --> 01:39:41,810
You just have to remember it.
Worse is when you're in the middle of 

2389
01:39:41,810 --> 01:39:41,810
conversation.
Like,

2390
01:39:41,810 --> 01:39:41,810
stop,
please don't talk.

2391
01:39:41,810 --> 01:39:43,380
I'm going to write this down before I 
forget it,

2392
01:39:43,381 --> 01:39:45,750
you know?
So now I have to pee.

2393
01:39:45,780 --> 01:39:48,780
Can I do that right in there?
Should I bring this with me?

2394
01:39:48,810 --> 01:39:53,810
None of them are just right down there.
You guys feel we're going to fill the 

2395
01:39:53,941 --> 01:39:58,941
time.
Brian actually has recently started 

2396
01:39:58,941 --> 01:40:01,911
doing standup comedy as well.
And a fucking feed froze on Ustream,

2397
01:40:02,160 --> 01:40:07,160
but what else is new?
People are constantly complaining about 

2398
01:40:07,160 --> 01:40:07,160
that.

2399
01:40:07,160 --> 01:40:10,500
You know,
I don't think ustream is designed for a 

2400
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:10,500
couple thousand people at a time.
Right?

2401
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:10,500
Yeah.
I don't know what it is.

2402
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:12,480
I don't really know.
But we have Brian.

2403
01:40:12,481 --> 01:40:13,680
Anyway,
what I was saying,

2404
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:16,530
I'm Brian fucking killed it this weekend
and Embraer,

2405
01:40:16,860 --> 01:40:19,260
you hit a new milestone this weekend.
New stuff.

2406
01:40:19,290 --> 01:40:24,290
Give me some new step up and it 
definitely figured something out that 

2407
01:40:24,290 --> 01:40:24,870
Saturday show on.
We were talking about how interesting it

2408
01:40:24,871 --> 01:40:29,871
is that he gets this weird opportunity 
to do stand up where he did stand up a 

2409
01:40:29,871 --> 01:40:34,101
bunch of years ago and did the Bob Hope 
joke that we've all talked about on the 

2410
01:40:34,101 --> 01:40:35,160
podcast before.
If you haven't heard the joke,

2411
01:40:35,161 --> 01:40:37,860
he got up in front of a room full of old
people and said,

2412
01:40:37,861 --> 01:40:42,861
do you think when Bob hope died,
they flew out his body to entertain all 

2413
01:40:42,861 --> 01:40:44,260
the dead troops to Iraq,
you know,

2414
01:40:44,270 --> 01:40:45,650
and it bombed so bad.

2415
01:40:45,650 --> 01:40:47,400
He stopped doing standup for like five 
years.

2416
01:40:47,401 --> 01:40:48,090
More than that.
Actually.

2417
01:40:48,091 --> 01:40:49,560
I was thinking about that.
The timing.

2418
01:40:49,561 --> 01:40:51,450
I think it was more because it was when 
bob hooked,

2419
01:40:51,451 --> 01:40:55,330
I was like 2003,
I don't even remember,

2420
01:40:55,331 --> 01:40:57,170
but then I didn't get back until like 
this year.

2421
01:40:57,190 --> 01:40:59,680
So you did a little bit at one point in 
time,

2422
01:40:59,681 --> 01:41:01,420
remember?
I mean I threw you up in Atlanta.

2423
01:41:01,450 --> 01:41:02,360
You went up thought,
right,

2424
01:41:02,361 --> 01:41:02,890
right,
right.

2425
01:41:02,891 --> 01:41:07,891
Yeah.
You got a new girlfriend and you quit 

2426
01:41:07,891 --> 01:41:07,891
again.
Yeah.

2427
01:41:07,891 --> 01:41:07,891
That was like for like a month or two.
I did it.

2428
01:41:07,891 --> 01:41:09,490
It's relationships.
We would get you.

2429
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:12,160
Your relationships would get you and 
then you just wouldn't have the time.

2430
01:41:12,190 --> 01:41:17,190
Yeah.
Well right now I can't even imagine 

2431
01:41:17,190 --> 01:41:19,081
being in that same relationship because 
I pretty much do stand up once or twice 

2432
01:41:19,081 --> 01:41:20,730
at night now and I have a podcast on top
of it like I've been up.

2433
01:41:20,740 --> 01:41:22,630
This is my second podcast.
They have another one right after.

2434
01:41:22,631 --> 01:41:27,631
This just seems so much happier to have.
What did I not just being out of the 

2435
01:41:27,971 --> 01:41:32,971
relationship,
but do you know you're getting a chance 

2436
01:41:32,971 --> 01:41:34,300
to express yourself now in a way that 
you didn't get a chance to do before you

2437
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:39,360
know?
Back then all you could do is make your 

2438
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:40,180
funny videos that's making those videos 
killed me.

2439
01:41:40,210 --> 01:41:45,210
I mean that's sitting in front of by 
yourself editing for till five in the 

2440
01:41:45,210 --> 01:41:47,470
morning every night and then he did that
all week.

2441
01:41:47,471 --> 01:41:52,471
That that's as creative as that is.
It's such a slow process and it makes 

2442
01:41:52,471 --> 01:41:54,700
you just like,
I was not talking to anybody.

2443
01:41:54,740 --> 01:41:59,740
Well,
I think part of the problem is that 

2444
01:41:59,740 --> 01:41:59,740
you're a real perfectionist.
You know,

2445
01:41:59,740 --> 01:42:00,970
we just took some of these things and 
edit them together,

2446
01:42:00,971 --> 01:42:03,820
sort of like the way Dana White's God 
does it for video blogs.

2447
01:42:04,120 --> 01:42:06,080
Like we should put a video together if 
somebody's like,

2448
01:42:06,090 --> 01:42:07,300
I've been,
I don't know if you saw on twitter,

2449
01:42:07,301 --> 01:42:10,290
I put up a on twitter.
I put a twitter level.

2450
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:12,080
You're going on stage last night.
Oh really?

2451
01:42:12,220 --> 01:42:13,840
I think we just need to keep on doing 
that shit.

2452
01:42:14,020 --> 01:42:15,530
You know what I mean?
Find finding.

2453
01:42:15,540 --> 01:42:17,980
I'll retweet it and we need to do more 
videos.

2454
01:42:17,981 --> 01:42:20,740
But when I originally hired Brian,
that's what his job was.

2455
01:42:21,030 --> 01:42:22,100
A video guy.
Yeah.

2456
01:42:22,120 --> 01:42:24,700
Know your podcast cohost slash standup 
comedian.

2457
01:42:24,701 --> 01:42:26,770
We were getting more listeners with 
podcasts and the videos,

2458
01:42:27,610 --> 01:42:31,350
but I think you have an immense talent 
when it comes to editing video that,

2459
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:32,130
you know,
I mean,

2460
01:42:32,170 --> 01:42:37,170
just not being served.
Brian is actually just started doing 

2461
01:42:37,170 --> 01:42:40,861
stand up himself.
He did it a long time ago and took a 

2462
01:42:40,861 --> 01:42:41,710
bunch of years off and then got back 
into it again.

2463
01:42:41,710 --> 01:42:42,530
So,
you know,

2464
01:42:42,610 --> 01:42:43,810
that's why I thought this,
um,

2465
01:42:44,050 --> 01:42:47,530
the subject is very fascinating to me.
The starting of the routine.

2466
01:42:47,680 --> 01:42:49,380
Do you feel comfortable on stage?
Uh,

2467
01:42:49,390 --> 01:42:51,610
yeah.
It's said it's weird because,

2468
01:42:51,611 --> 01:42:53,920
uh,
I took 30 years off,

2469
01:42:55,070 --> 01:42:57,160
you know,
how um,

2470
01:42:58,120 --> 01:43:03,120
and it,
it is feeling comfort because I know in 

2471
01:43:03,120 --> 01:43:04,180
the past when I've done hosting gigs,
I've always felt a little funny,

2472
01:43:04,240 --> 01:43:09,240
you know,
like I'm like I'm impersonating someone 

2473
01:43:09,240 --> 01:43:12,451
doing standup.
And so I think coming at it with a 

2474
01:43:12,451 --> 01:43:15,091
looser form,
I like going on stage and just trusting 

2475
01:43:15,091 --> 01:43:16,390
myself to have areas that I want to go 
into and trusting myself to be funny,

2476
01:43:16,920 --> 01:43:18,020
uh,
is,

2477
01:43:18,120 --> 01:43:21,310
it has been fun.
It's been fun to go up and like find out

2478
01:43:21,311 --> 01:43:24,400
what the bits are on stage and a lot of 
ways.

2479
01:43:24,430 --> 01:43:29,430
Yeah,
and that is the thing about standup is 

2480
01:43:29,430 --> 01:43:31,561
like there's a totally different thing 
when it's in front of a live audience 

2481
01:43:31,561 --> 01:43:35,941
and you're trying to get laughs and your
voice is amplified and they're all 

2482
01:43:35,941 --> 01:43:38,800
there.
You feel their energy looking at you and

2483
01:43:38,801 --> 01:43:40,720
you know,
different synapses fire.

2484
01:43:40,790 --> 01:43:43,510
Yeah.
Well if you were in a social setting and

2485
01:43:43,511 --> 01:43:47,230
someone talked for 45 minutes straight 
without letting anyone else talk,

2486
01:43:47,260 --> 01:43:49,840
you would just think even no matter how 
entertaining they were,

2487
01:43:50,020 --> 01:43:51,320
he'd be on what an asshole

2488
01:43:52,140 --> 01:43:53,980
know.
I talk about this on stage.

2489
01:43:53,981 --> 01:43:58,981
It's the most ridiculous.
I say that standup is the most 

2490
01:43:58,981 --> 01:44:00,971
ridiculous job you could ever want to 
have and I want to be the only one who 

2491
01:44:00,971 --> 01:44:04,300
talks for an hour and I want to have my 
voice amplified way above everyone 

2492
01:44:04,300 --> 01:44:04,920
else's and I want to be lit.
Yeah,

2493
01:44:04,980 --> 01:44:06,920
that'd be welded as well.
Everyone else is in the dark.

2494
01:44:07,220 --> 01:44:08,690
It's also weird just because like 
growing up,

2495
01:44:08,691 --> 01:44:10,970
I was always the person trying to make 
everyone laugh though.

2496
01:44:10,971 --> 01:44:12,260
I was like the,
you know,

2497
01:44:13,010 --> 01:44:18,010
what I love doing is trying to make 
people laugh like at my high school and 

2498
01:44:18,010 --> 01:44:18,860
middle school and stuff like that.
So I kind of see like class clown,

2499
01:44:19,100 --> 01:44:20,780
comedian type thing.
I see that also.

2500
01:44:20,781 --> 01:44:25,781
It's not where,
it's not like trying to take over 

2501
01:44:25,781 --> 01:44:26,090
everybody and be on a microphone stand.
You're just trying to make people happy.

2502
01:44:26,590 --> 01:44:31,590
It was most certainly a bunch of 
different types of people that become 

2503
01:44:31,590 --> 01:44:31,590
standup Comedians,
you know?

2504
01:44:32,020 --> 01:44:32,830
Uh,
there's,

2505
01:44:33,080 --> 01:44:38,080
you know,
I mean to say that it always comes from 

2506
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:40,121
one place that's not really true.
Like I had just never comes from a good 

2507
01:44:40,121 --> 01:44:44,321
place.
Know exactly a huge vista of bad places.

2508
01:44:44,470 --> 01:44:49,470
I had always felt for a long time,
like there was something about me that 

2509
01:44:49,470 --> 01:44:53,081
wasn't legitimate,
that I wasn't a legitimate comment 

2510
01:44:53,081 --> 01:44:53,420
because I wasn't the same guy as 
everybody else.

2511
01:44:53,421 --> 01:44:55,460
I wasn't afraid of people.
I was,

2512
01:44:55,461 --> 01:44:59,210
I grew up doing martial arts and 
fighting and I went from fighting,

2513
01:44:59,240 --> 01:45:00,170
you know,
to,

2514
01:45:00,330 --> 01:45:05,330
to stand up.
And then it was like this weird thing 

2515
01:45:05,330 --> 01:45:05,330
like,
I'm,

2516
01:45:05,330 --> 01:45:07,870
what am I,
this weird jock thing that's doing 

2517
01:45:07,870 --> 01:45:07,870
complicated.
Who the fuck am I like,

2518
01:45:07,870 --> 01:45:08,400
well,
what is but doesn't just,

2519
01:45:08,530 --> 01:45:10,040
you just life has to suck.

2520
01:45:10,430 --> 01:45:15,430
And then you have to make funny out of 
the suck your life could suck in all 

2521
01:45:15,430 --> 01:45:15,430
kinds of weird ways.
You know,

2522
01:45:15,430 --> 01:45:16,010
like Nat Geo,
Pto,

2523
01:45:16,020 --> 01:45:18,470
Hanson's livestock was his father used 
to beat the fuck out of him,

2524
01:45:18,471 --> 01:45:20,150
you know?
And everybody's is different.

2525
01:45:20,151 --> 01:45:23,270
Mine was being abandoned by my father.
You know,

2526
01:45:23,271 --> 01:45:28,271
everyone's had their own little weird 
thing that you're trying to make up for 

2527
01:45:28,271 --> 01:45:29,490
what that exorbitant amount of attention
you request on stage,

2528
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:30,530
you know?
Yeah.

2529
01:45:30,890 --> 01:45:35,890
But if you don't do,
if you don't have some fucking weird 

2530
01:45:35,890 --> 01:45:35,960
need,
you never really get there.

2531
01:45:36,180 --> 01:45:37,850
You know?
I don't know anyone.

2532
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:42,880
I mean it's.
And I shouldn't say this because of 

2533
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:43,400
course it's possible for someone to be a
great comedian with a happy childhood.

2534
01:45:43,401 --> 01:45:44,630
It must be.
I mean,

2535
01:45:44,631 --> 01:45:46,640
if you're just really smart and figure 
it out,

2536
01:45:46,700 --> 01:45:48,350
but I've never met that plans.
Don't know.

2537
01:45:49,130 --> 01:45:50,450
Yeah.
Anyway,

2538
01:45:50,860 --> 01:45:52,220
my childhood was pretty good.
I mean,

2539
01:45:52,221 --> 01:45:57,221
my,
my biggest problem is bullies and just 

2540
01:45:57,221 --> 01:45:57,350
shit like that,
but even that is a big issue mainly wise

2541
01:45:57,540 --> 01:46:02,540
dude.
That's the only reason why I got into 

2542
01:46:02,540 --> 01:46:02,540
martial arts.
I didn't get into martial arts because I

2543
01:46:02,540 --> 01:46:03,470
wanted to risk my fucking brain cells 
and go out there.

2544
01:46:03,490 --> 01:46:08,490
I was terrified of other kids.
I moved around a lot when I was a kid 

2545
01:46:08,490 --> 01:46:12,671
and we moved at basically every three 
years we moved to a new place and I did 

2546
01:46:12,671 --> 01:46:13,270
that too.
Yeah,

2547
01:46:13,730 --> 01:46:18,730
that's another thing.
I mean it's just you don't have a 

2548
01:46:18,730 --> 01:46:18,730
stability,
you don't feel stable,

2549
01:46:18,730 --> 01:46:19,970
so you feel this need to express 
yourself exorbitantly,

2550
01:46:19,971 --> 01:46:24,971
you know,
you have to get more attention than he 

2551
01:46:24,971 --> 01:46:24,971
deserved,
you know?

2552
01:46:24,971 --> 01:46:25,370
Yeah.
I had a drunk dad who was also diagnosed

2553
01:46:25,371 --> 01:46:28,390
as borderline personality disorder.
Fuck Dude.

2554
01:46:28,680 --> 01:46:31,070
I found that when my wife,
I told my mom,

2555
01:46:31,370 --> 01:46:36,370
well,
she's been diagnosed with borderline 

2556
01:46:36,370 --> 01:46:36,370
personality goes,
oh,

2557
01:46:36,370 --> 01:46:38,400
that's what they said your dad had 
really lost.

2558
01:46:38,930 --> 01:46:42,230
So you knew breach all these subjects on
stage.

2559
01:46:42,300 --> 01:46:42,830
Yeah,
yeah,

2560
01:46:42,900 --> 01:46:44,290
yeah.
Talk.

2561
01:46:44,450 --> 01:46:49,450
But it's.
I'd say it's probably about maybe 25 

2562
01:46:49,450 --> 01:46:50,160
percent of its like about my personal

2563
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:54,060
life and stuff.
Another and then maybe more.

2564
01:46:54,090 --> 01:46:59,090
Maybe 35.
You're free one and the rest is about a 

2565
01:46:59,090 --> 01:46:59,970
life about life.
Yeah.

2566
01:47:00,150 --> 01:47:02,150
But other things.
You're free Wednesday night and you want

2567
01:47:02,151 --> 01:47:04,080
to go up at the Joe Show?
We have.

2568
01:47:04,081 --> 01:47:05,190
Oh yeah.
We're doing this thing.

2569
01:47:05,191 --> 01:47:10,191
It's sounds comedy whole.
We're doing it pretty much every 

2570
01:47:10,191 --> 01:47:10,830
Wednesday night in Hollywood.
This is a really tiny club.

2571
01:47:10,870 --> 01:47:13,340
This great guy owns.
He's this guy.

2572
01:47:13,530 --> 01:47:18,530
He owned a club in New York and then he 
opened up a small one in La and it got 

2573
01:47:18,530 --> 01:47:19,680
closed down because he didn't have a 
liquor license,

2574
01:47:19,681 --> 01:47:24,681
so now he's got a new one on melrose and
there's a bakery behind it and the own 

2575
01:47:24,681 --> 01:47:29,000
data as well and they're going to close 
that down and it's going to be a huge 

2576
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:29,350
place.
So right now it's only like a 80,

2577
01:47:29,370 --> 01:47:32,040
80 or 90 seats.
Fuck storied place.

2578
01:47:32,040 --> 01:47:34,800
It's right on melrose,
melrose and fuller.

2579
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,060
So I'd love if you want to that.
Yeah.

2580
01:47:36,090 --> 01:47:37,880
It's fun because I know I'm done.
Yeah.

2581
01:47:37,950 --> 01:47:40,680
Are you getting news radio fans like 
who?

2582
01:47:41,010 --> 01:47:42,160
What kind of people do you guys?
Well,

2583
01:47:42,180 --> 01:47:42,870
it's been like,
yeah,

2584
01:47:42,871 --> 01:47:45,450
it's been like A.
I meet a lot of this.

2585
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:50,560
Well,
most of the sets I've done I've done 

2586
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:53,511
unannounced so far except for these,
these sets of done at ucb and when you 

2587
01:47:53,641 --> 01:47:57,940
did the UCB ucb,
I guess it was a lot of kids in the hall

2588
01:47:57,941 --> 01:47:59,580
and these radio fans definitely that,
you know,

2589
01:47:59,581 --> 01:48:02,250
they know all about the show.
That must be great.

2590
01:48:02,370 --> 01:48:05,370
A great environment to like what we're 
saying about Brian is Brian,

2591
01:48:05,371 --> 01:48:10,020
people know him from the podcast now,
so he only went upstage in a prayer this

2592
01:48:10,020 --> 01:48:11,970
weekend.
They all cheer and went crazy for them.

2593
01:48:11,990 --> 01:48:12,670
Yeah.
So it's like,

2594
01:48:12,680 --> 01:48:15,720
it's like even though you're learning 
like they like you,

2595
01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:16,770
it's good to have that.

2596
01:48:16,770 --> 01:48:18,190
Yeah.
It's good to have that come.

2597
01:48:18,520 --> 01:48:19,650
Yeah.
I'm cheating.

2598
01:48:20,130 --> 01:48:21,500
Cheat Code.
Yeah.

2599
01:48:21,780 --> 01:48:24,770
It's definitely good God mode,
but again,

2600
01:48:24,860 --> 01:48:26,110
you know,
but then again that,

2601
01:48:26,111 --> 01:48:28,530
that last,
that advise you about 30 seconds.

2602
01:48:28,940 --> 01:48:30,400
It's true.
It's true.

2603
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:34,650
When I was on fear factor,
I would dread meeting fear factor fans,

2604
01:48:34,651 --> 01:48:37,000
but always be happy when someone said 
they love Newsradio.

2605
01:48:37,160 --> 01:48:38,580
Yeah.
It was like,

2606
01:48:38,650 --> 01:48:41,250
you know,
you and your prostitution Gig,

2607
01:48:41,251 --> 01:48:43,830
but now you were awesome when you're 
doing that other thing.

2608
01:48:44,090 --> 01:48:45,620
Now I was a little fear factor.
It was.

2609
01:48:45,621 --> 01:48:50,621
I was just funny to me because it was 
all the way through news radio Yo said 

2610
01:48:50,621 --> 01:48:50,760
next week I do is just called joe gets 
paid.

2611
01:48:50,761 --> 01:48:53,130
I don't give a fuck what it is.
It's just neat blown it,

2612
01:48:53,131 --> 01:48:54,090
dude.
I don't give a fuck.

2613
01:48:54,540 --> 01:48:56,680
It's just joe gets paid.
That was.

2614
01:48:56,681 --> 01:49:01,681
I was recruiting everyone else there.
We're just going to drink coffee and 

2615
01:49:01,681 --> 01:49:02,280
we're just going to run the cameras.
It's going to be called joe gets paid.

2616
01:49:04,980 --> 01:49:07,500
Really wound up happening.
It's like the secret man.

2617
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:10,650
I had a fast.
You sent the message out to the universe

2618
01:49:10,651 --> 01:49:12,450
did dude,
I believe in that man.

2619
01:49:12,790 --> 01:49:13,710
Leave.
You can do that.

2620
01:49:14,940 --> 01:49:17,910
Did you have any experience with people 
who were hooked on the secret?

2621
01:49:17,940 --> 01:49:20,270
Do you remember what huge.
Yeah,

2622
01:49:20,271 --> 01:49:22,320
and that's essentially.
It was like I'm remembering.

2623
01:49:22,530 --> 01:49:24,940
I remember it was like a,
uh,

2624
01:49:25,100 --> 01:49:26,280
like,
well my ex wife Chrissy,

2625
01:49:26,310 --> 01:49:28,740
she went,
she was wanting to see the film,

2626
01:49:29,070 --> 01:49:30,330
but all right,
but it's,

2627
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:32,330
and people will talk,
people talk about,

2628
01:49:32,620 --> 01:49:37,620
well,
it scientific and I'd have scientific 

2629
01:49:37,620 --> 01:49:39,480
scientific about it.
It's complete bullshit.

2630
01:49:39,481 --> 01:49:44,010
It's like Rodney Allen rippy fucking 
power of positive thinking bullshit.

2631
01:49:44,011 --> 01:49:44,660
It's like,
you know,

2632
01:49:44,680 --> 01:49:46,740
and it's like,
if you really think that,

2633
01:49:46,900 --> 01:49:47,770
so,
so,

2634
01:49:47,771 --> 01:49:48,190
uh,

2635
01:49:48,190 --> 01:49:53,190
yeah.
So every child dies of starvation just 

2636
01:49:53,190 --> 01:49:53,200
wasn't putting out enough positive 
energy.

2637
01:49:54,040 --> 01:49:59,040
Yeah.
I had an argument with a friend of mine 

2638
01:49:59,040 --> 01:49:59,040
into it,
you know,

2639
01:49:59,040 --> 01:49:59,040
so into it.
I go,

2640
01:49:59,040 --> 01:49:59,350
okay,
you ready for this?

2641
01:49:59,620 --> 01:50:03,100
Babies die in drive bys.
What's going on there?

2642
01:50:03,160 --> 01:50:04,960
Yeah,
they manifesting the wrong reality.

2643
01:50:04,970 --> 01:50:07,600
That's one.
They're not setting a positive energy in

2644
01:50:07,601 --> 01:50:08,200
the universe.
They're not,

2645
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:13,320
they're not.
They're not really thinking about what 

2646
01:50:13,320 --> 01:50:13,320
they want and apply.
It's so ridiculous and so culty.

2647
01:50:13,320 --> 01:50:17,320
But the fascinating thing is that it's 
confirmation bias.

2648
01:50:17,590 --> 01:50:20,800
You're only looking at what you,
what supports your case,

2649
01:50:21,200 --> 01:50:24,460
and there's a bunch of people that are 
successful and they're saying,

2650
01:50:24,461 --> 01:50:29,461
well,
I envisioned it and that's how I became 

2651
01:50:29,461 --> 01:50:29,461
successful.
We're the,

2652
01:50:29,461 --> 01:50:33,150
we're the fucking people that envisioned
it and they're poor as shit right now 

2653
01:50:33,150 --> 01:50:33,160
and they're going,
I don't get it.

2654
01:50:33,190 --> 01:50:33,760
What's happening?

2655
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:36,790
It's like you're only using the people 
that are successful.

2656
01:50:37,250 --> 01:50:42,250
You.
You got to show me a dude who's fucking 

2657
01:50:42,250 --> 01:50:42,310
starving,
and then you apply it to him and then he

2658
01:50:42,311 --> 01:50:45,490
goes out in the world and then you come 
back in 15 years and go,

2659
01:50:45,491 --> 01:50:45,970
okay,
well look,

2660
01:50:45,971 --> 01:50:48,430
the guys that are successful and you 
gotta show me at least.

2661
01:50:49,420 --> 01:50:49,800
Yeah,
you get.

2662
01:50:50,270 --> 01:50:52,420
If you take 100,
you've got to have at least more than 50

2663
01:50:52,421 --> 01:50:57,421
of them succeed or to be know 
statistically meaningful out of a 

2664
01:50:57,880 --> 01:50:58,300
thousand,
you know,

2665
01:50:58,310 --> 01:51:03,310
and that one is,
wants to let you know the secret that 

2666
01:51:03,310 --> 01:51:06,271
it's all simple.
You've just got to think positive like 

2667
01:51:06,271 --> 01:51:08,971
any religion,
any religion where people want to 

2668
01:51:08,971 --> 01:51:10,960
believe that they can do something that 
will,

2669
01:51:11,050 --> 01:51:14,230
that will give them power over the rest 
of creation.

2670
01:51:14,730 --> 01:51:16,930
You know,
the rest of creation is going to somehow

2671
01:51:16,931 --> 01:51:21,931
fall into line with their wishes because
they prayed to God or they sent out 

2672
01:51:22,391 --> 01:51:23,650
positive energy.

2673
01:51:23,950 --> 01:51:26,260
You know,
I think it's fascinating though and it's

2674
01:51:26,261 --> 01:51:31,261
very unfortunate that this,
this craze is so discredited and so the,

2675
01:51:31,410 --> 01:51:36,410
the,
the place where they're coming from is 

2676
01:51:36,410 --> 01:51:37,951
so illogical because the concept of 
thinking healthy and positive is very 

2677
01:51:37,951 --> 01:51:42,661
important for formulating a good life,
for figuring out how to be connected to 

2678
01:51:42,701 --> 01:51:45,940
the right kind of people and how to send
the right kind of energy out so that you

2679
01:51:46,100 --> 01:51:51,100
know,
you foster healthy relationships and 

2680
01:51:51,100 --> 01:51:53,840
that you're what you're doing and 
pursuing in life is something that you 

2681
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:56,050
get motivation out of or rather that you
get satisfaction out of feeling poor,

2682
01:51:56,090 --> 01:51:58,810
positive.
Having a positive outlook is healthy.

2683
01:51:58,850 --> 01:52:00,680
It's better for you,
you know,

2684
01:52:01,070 --> 01:52:02,350
you know Jesus.
I mean,

2685
01:52:02,990 --> 01:52:05,200
I think living with my first wife,
you know,

2686
01:52:05,201 --> 01:52:07,480
so it was just negative about 
everything.

2687
01:52:07,481 --> 01:52:08,290
Everything was negative.
It's,

2688
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:08,960
it's,
it,

2689
01:52:08,970 --> 01:52:10,120
it is horrible for you.

2690
01:52:10,150 --> 01:52:11,350
Yes.
I've been there.

2691
01:52:11,351 --> 01:52:13,900
I've been there many times in 
relationships and in friendships.

2692
01:52:13,901 --> 01:52:16,210
I've had friendships where the people 
are negative and you're like,

2693
01:52:16,620 --> 01:52:18,640
you get away from them and just like 
you're catching your breath.

2694
01:52:18,641 --> 01:52:20,080
And I'm like,
what is this person doing to me?

2695
01:52:20,081 --> 01:52:21,400
They're fucking,
they're draining.

2696
01:52:21,401 --> 01:52:22,600
Yeah,
doing something to me.

2697
01:52:22,750 --> 01:52:24,700
So it's definitely positive.
Being positive.

2698
01:52:24,760 --> 01:52:25,710
That part is great.
Yet.

2699
01:52:25,711 --> 01:52:28,090
And there's even,
there is science behind that.

2700
01:52:28,120 --> 01:52:28,770
Yes.
There are.

2701
01:52:28,780 --> 01:52:30,220
Keeping a positive attitude,
you know,

2702
01:52:30,240 --> 01:52:35,240
keeps you healthier,
keeps your immune system functioning 

2703
01:52:35,240 --> 01:52:35,240
better.
Well,

2704
01:52:35,240 --> 01:52:35,950
I've seen it.
I've seen positive and negative thinking

2705
01:52:35,951 --> 01:52:38,120
during a dmt trip.
I had a,

2706
01:52:38,121 --> 01:52:39,640
uh,
during a psychedelic trip,

2707
01:52:39,641 --> 01:52:44,641
I had this weird moment where I was 
thinking all these negative things 

2708
01:52:44,641 --> 01:52:46,670
because psychedelic trips are just so 
out of control.

2709
01:52:46,671 --> 01:52:51,260
There's so beyond bizarre and they're so
incredibly,

2710
01:52:51,261 --> 01:52:55,160
like a self examined a Tory,
if that's not even a word,

2711
01:52:55,161 --> 01:52:55,670
but you know,
you're,

2712
01:52:55,671 --> 01:52:56,090
you're,
you're,

2713
01:52:56,091 --> 01:52:57,290
you're so introspective.

2714
01:52:57,290 --> 01:52:59,900
You're looking at so many different 
aspects of your life,

2715
01:52:59,901 --> 01:53:02,180
like at a million miles an hour,
then you can,

2716
01:53:02,210 --> 01:53:04,910
you can get like a negative thought and 
they can blow away.

2717
01:53:04,911 --> 01:53:09,911
And that's where bad trips come from.
So in the middle of this negative 

2718
01:53:09,911 --> 01:53:09,911
thought,
this,

2719
01:53:09,911 --> 01:53:10,300
I saw this,
this,

2720
01:53:10,360 --> 01:53:15,360
this like dmt is a very visionary,
psychedelic experience and you have a 

2721
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:16,820
weird black,
dark,

2722
01:53:16,821 --> 01:53:21,821
fucking nasty,
dark green and dark black patterns and 

2723
01:53:21,821 --> 01:53:22,880
colors.
And then in the middle of it,

2724
01:53:22,881 --> 01:53:27,881
I realized what I was doing,
a realize that as being negative and I 

2725
01:53:27,881 --> 01:53:29,390
took a deep breath and I let go and be 
an became positive,

2726
01:53:29,391 --> 01:53:33,860
decided to think positive and it 
blossomed like flowers in front of me.

2727
01:53:33,870 --> 01:53:38,870
And the colors changed and they all 
became bright and beautiful and vibrant 

2728
01:53:38,961 --> 01:53:41,540
and it became light in the patterns 
became beautiful.

2729
01:53:41,780 --> 01:53:42,380
And I was like,
wow,

2730
01:53:42,381 --> 01:53:47,381
this is like a lesson I'm learning from 
a psychedelic experience about the real 

2731
01:53:47,381 --> 01:53:48,710
physical manifestation of negative and 
positive thoughts.

2732
01:53:48,750 --> 01:53:52,330
They actually have a real effect that 
they think they say that,

2733
01:53:52,370 --> 01:53:57,370
that,
that if you just force yourself to 

2734
01:53:57,370 --> 01:53:57,370
smile,
yeah,

2735
01:53:57,370 --> 01:53:58,460
you can reduce depression.
Yeah.

2736
01:53:58,610 --> 01:54:03,610
Like your depression will fade a little 
mountain all the way if you're really 

2737
01:54:03,610 --> 01:54:04,190
depressed.
But if you can force yourself to smile.

2738
01:54:04,450 --> 01:54:08,630
I really like put on a big demo.
Like you just keep it there long enough.

2739
01:54:08,780 --> 01:54:11,090
It'll get brain reacts as though you're 
happy.

2740
01:54:11,570 --> 01:54:16,570
Your brain starts to release the same 
chemicals it would if you were actually 

2741
01:54:16,570 --> 01:54:16,570
amazing.
And it's like.

2742
01:54:16,570 --> 01:54:17,480
So it's like,
you know,

2743
01:54:17,730 --> 01:54:19,040
the mind,
the mind,

2744
01:54:19,041 --> 01:54:21,320
body connection is true.
It really is real.

2745
01:54:21,410 --> 01:54:26,410
What we are is the most fascinating 
organic computer that's ever been 

2746
01:54:26,410 --> 01:54:31,391
created and we don't have a fucking 
single book on how to use the operating 

2747
01:54:31,391 --> 01:54:32,730
system currently.
Now just the Bible Joe's.

2748
01:54:32,740 --> 01:54:33,320
Yes,
the Bible.

2749
01:54:34,530 --> 01:54:39,530
We are all,
we are all raised by people who are 

2750
01:54:39,530 --> 01:54:39,620
completely clueless as to how to raise 
someone.

2751
01:54:39,650 --> 01:54:41,060
I mean,
almost every one of us.

2752
01:54:41,120 --> 01:54:46,120
Yeah.
And so we develop and you can get in 

2753
01:54:46,120 --> 01:54:46,120
these patterns of thinking that your 
parents have,

2754
01:54:46,120 --> 01:54:46,280
you know,
it's like,

2755
01:54:46,490 --> 01:54:49,580
you know,
if you grow up around like Mrs Rogan has

2756
01:54:49,581 --> 01:54:52,400
a very negative parents,
especially her mom.

2757
01:54:52,401 --> 01:54:57,401
Her mom had a very hard life and her mom
is one of those that you can't tell her 

2758
01:54:57,401 --> 01:55:01,211
a good thing.
Well this is just gonna happen and it's 

2759
01:55:01,211 --> 01:55:01,580
just going to fall apart.
And then what happens here?

2760
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:04,160
And then what happens there and you 
know,

2761
01:55:04,370 --> 01:55:05,310
and Jessica,
whoops,

2762
01:55:05,320 --> 01:55:07,250
was that her name has managed to avoid 
it.

2763
01:55:07,610 --> 01:55:09,260
But for the most part,
it's,

2764
01:55:10,030 --> 01:55:12,080
it's like if you,
if you develop in a,

2765
01:55:12,100 --> 01:55:17,100
in a family,
a household at a bunch of negative 

2766
01:55:17,100 --> 01:55:17,100
motherfuckers like that shit can,
it,

2767
01:55:17,100 --> 01:55:18,200
it becomes like a,
um,

2768
01:55:18,640 --> 01:55:21,440
like a path that you get on.
It becomes a track,

2769
01:55:21,660 --> 01:55:22,850
you know,
you're on this track.

2770
01:55:22,910 --> 01:55:26,420
I grew up in a family where everyone 
else might actually metal the brothers,

2771
01:55:26,421 --> 01:55:27,650
not that way,
but the rest of my family,

2772
01:55:27,651 --> 01:55:28,910
they're all like,
oh,

2773
01:55:28,940 --> 01:55:29,780
well,
whatever you do,

2774
01:55:29,781 --> 01:55:31,790
the system is going to get you.
You know,

2775
01:55:31,791 --> 01:55:32,840
it's like,
it's stacked against you.

2776
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:34,510
You can't win.
You know,

2777
01:55:34,540 --> 01:55:35,050
like,
that's,

2778
01:55:35,090 --> 01:55:40,090
you know,
I think part of that is my mother was 

2779
01:55:40,090 --> 01:55:40,700
working class English and that's the way
that you're raised,

2780
01:55:40,730 --> 01:55:42,270
you know,
so you know,

2781
01:55:42,290 --> 01:55:43,980
well we'll try what you will,
but you really

2782
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:45,120
can't get away from it.
You know,

2783
01:55:45,510 --> 01:55:50,510
it's all stacked against you.
So God damn difficult to manufacture an 

2784
01:55:50,510 --> 01:55:50,740
awesome environment.
And you know,

2785
01:55:50,750 --> 01:55:54,450
it's been one of my main focuses as a,
as a grownup,

2786
01:55:54,510 --> 01:55:59,510
as an adult,
is to try to manufacture the most 

2787
01:55:59,510 --> 01:56:03,171
positive atmosphere possible both in 
work and friendships and relationships 

2788
01:56:03,171 --> 01:56:07,530
in everything that I do try to like 
steer it towards the most positive place

2789
01:56:07,531 --> 01:56:09,240
possible.
You know,

2790
01:56:09,780 --> 01:56:14,780
you can,
your life can be really fucking awesome 

2791
01:56:14,780 --> 01:56:15,810
if you do that correctly.
And it can suck real bad if you don't.

2792
01:56:16,740 --> 01:56:18,840
Yeah,
yeah know.

2793
01:56:18,930 --> 01:56:22,110
But the secret Nazi shit.
Well as well as the,

2794
01:56:22,280 --> 01:56:24,710
I mean,
I believe her that any,

2795
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,690
anything that makes you feel like you 
have any control over your destiny is an

2796
01:56:27,691 --> 01:56:29,670
illusion because then people think,
well,

2797
01:56:29,671 --> 01:56:30,120
I,
you know,

2798
01:56:30,210 --> 01:56:32,130
I make good choices.
So good things happen.

2799
01:56:32,490 --> 01:56:34,920
And they go,
well that's still just pure luck because

2800
01:56:35,700 --> 01:56:40,700
every single day you are tied up in a 
chain reaction of millions of choices 

2801
01:56:40,700 --> 01:56:42,390
that are being made all around you every
day.

2802
01:56:42,600 --> 01:56:46,530
And all it has to be as one of those 
choices be someone wants to shoot you in

2803
01:56:46,531 --> 01:56:50,100
the head and that's the choice that's 
going to shape your destiny.

2804
01:56:50,320 --> 01:56:55,320
So.
And any day that someone doesn't shoot 

2805
01:56:55,320 --> 01:56:55,320
you in the head,
you know,

2806
01:56:55,320 --> 01:56:58,760
it's just luck or a guy with a vest once
a blow up a cafe where you're writing 

2807
01:56:58,760 --> 01:57:02,361
your novel or somebody sneezes while 
driving and goes over the curb or Texas 

2808
01:57:03,090 --> 01:57:05,370
slams into you and you guys.
Yeah,

2809
01:57:05,430 --> 01:57:06,180
for sure.
Yeah.

2810
01:57:06,181 --> 01:57:10,320
There's.
I've been considering this idea over the

2811
01:57:10,320 --> 01:57:15,320
last few years,
especially that the entire life that we 

2812
01:57:15,320 --> 01:57:17,541
live is sort of like a mathematical 
program and it's like this giant 

2813
01:57:17,541 --> 01:57:19,980
algorithm that's far too complex for us 
to really wrap our heads around it,

2814
01:57:20,160 --> 01:57:25,160
but that all these different motions and
all these emotions and actions and all 

2815
01:57:25,160 --> 01:57:25,760
these different things and circumstances
there,

2816
01:57:25,770 --> 01:57:30,770
they're actually literally really like 
integers that it's already a part of 

2817
01:57:30,770 --> 01:57:30,770
something that's creating something 
else.

2818
01:57:30,770 --> 01:57:32,410
It's like information theory.
Yeah.

2819
01:57:32,620 --> 01:57:37,620
It was the idea that the universe is 
nothing but information is just the 

2820
01:57:37,620 --> 01:57:40,761
universe.
The entire universe is just an 

2821
01:57:40,761 --> 01:57:41,130
information storage device.
It makes sense.

2822
01:57:41,160 --> 01:57:46,160
I mean,
when you look at the direction that 

2823
01:57:46,160 --> 01:57:48,981
humanity is,
and as another thing that's absolutely 

2824
01:57:48,981 --> 01:57:50,721
fascinating to me,
I'm completely fascinated with the idea 

2825
01:57:50,721 --> 01:57:51,060
of the singularity and with the idea of,
you know,

2826
01:57:51,061 --> 01:57:52,100
I mean,
even the,

2827
01:57:52,260 --> 01:57:53,870
the idea of end times,
they're there.

2828
01:57:53,880 --> 01:57:56,620
The idea of an apocalyptic scenario,
you know,

2829
01:57:57,420 --> 01:57:59,760
you look at like what human beings are 
doing.

2830
01:57:59,820 --> 01:58:04,820
I equate human beings to be in some 
weird sort of a caterpillar who doesn't 

2831
01:58:04,820 --> 01:58:05,160
know what's going to turn into a 
butterfly.

2832
01:58:05,310 --> 01:58:08,640
So we are absolutely obsessed with the 
newest,

2833
01:58:08,641 --> 01:58:13,641
greatest technological innovations and 
eventually that that's pushing to a 

2834
01:58:13,641 --> 01:58:18,111
certain direction and that direction is 
some sort of a redefinition of life as 

2835
01:58:18,111 --> 01:58:18,111
we know it.

2836
01:58:18,111 --> 01:58:22,820
Yeah,
I think I was thought that eventually 

2837
01:58:22,820 --> 01:58:24,621
the,
the earth itself would develop its own 

2838
01:58:24,621 --> 01:58:24,621
consciousness if it doesn't already 
have.

2839
01:58:24,621 --> 01:58:27,270
You may already.
And there's actually a theory called the

2840
01:58:27,271 --> 01:58:32,271
theory of the Noaa Sphere,
which is that the earth is enveloped in 

2841
01:58:32,271 --> 01:58:32,271
a,
uh,

2842
01:58:32,410 --> 01:58:34,470
just like the stratosphere,
that there's a noaa sphere,

2843
01:58:34,471 --> 01:58:38,070
which is a sphere of knowledge of 
information.

2844
01:58:38,220 --> 01:58:41,950
And that this notice fear exists around 
the earth and that,

2845
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:43,840
you know,
people can tap into it.

2846
01:58:44,170 --> 01:58:44,500
Yeah.
Well,

2847
01:58:44,501 --> 01:58:46,870
not even just around the earth,
that it's a dimension around you all the

2848
01:58:46,871 --> 01:58:49,000
time.
That's the idea of the muse.

2849
01:58:49,001 --> 01:58:50,830
Is that what you're really doing when 
you're,

2850
01:58:51,070 --> 01:58:56,070
when you're being completely creative,
is it you are just an antenna to pull in

2851
01:58:56,291 --> 01:58:58,750
all this information.
That's what Tesla had said.

2852
01:58:58,900 --> 01:58:59,530
Yes.
Slow.

2853
01:58:59,540 --> 01:59:04,540
Who's greatest inventor ever was,
was believed that he was receiving 

2854
01:59:04,540 --> 01:59:07,630
signals from other other life forms that
we're giving them this information.

2855
01:59:07,690 --> 01:59:11,470
And now of course,
the weird thing is that a physicists are

2856
01:59:11,471 --> 01:59:13,730
starting to toy with these ideas.
You know,

2857
01:59:13,750 --> 01:59:16,410
the idea of entanglement and idea of.
Sure.

2858
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:18,900
The idea of consciousness being nonlocal
yeah.

2859
01:59:18,970 --> 01:59:23,970
Know that your entire body is actually a
sort of some weird sort of an antenna 

2860
01:59:23,970 --> 01:59:23,970
and that,
you know,

2861
01:59:23,970 --> 01:59:24,280
the,
the,

2862
01:59:24,310 --> 01:59:29,310
the hormones and adrenaline and all 
these different things and you run it 

2863
01:59:29,310 --> 01:59:31,660
all the biological instincts that are 
there to keep the physical body alive or

2864
01:59:31,700 --> 01:59:36,700
no,
it's no more than like maintenance 

2865
01:59:36,700 --> 01:59:38,311
cycles that you have to run on a BMW.
Have you read about the Princeton did 

2866
01:59:38,311 --> 01:59:41,560
this huge multi year study of a mind 
machine interface?

2867
01:59:41,870 --> 01:59:42,430
No.
Uh,

2868
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:47,140
but basically that attention affects 
machines and uh,

2869
01:59:47,700 --> 01:59:52,700
that they did,
they did these studies where they use a 

2870
01:59:52,700 --> 01:59:52,700
random number generator.
Okay.

2871
01:59:52,700 --> 01:59:53,500
I did hear about this and they just had 
these,

2872
01:59:53,590 --> 01:59:58,590
had a random number generator and they 
had people just focus not anything 

2873
01:59:58,590 --> 01:59:59,410
specific,
just focus on the machine itself.

2874
02:00:00,190 --> 02:00:03,400
And the more and more people focused on 
the machine,

2875
02:00:03,820 --> 02:00:05,950
the less random the machine became.
It became,

2876
02:00:06,160 --> 02:00:10,070
it started having nonrandom patterns.
Human consciousness is something we,

2877
02:00:10,130 --> 02:00:11,770
we completely don't understand.
There's,

2878
02:00:11,771 --> 02:00:12,430
there's,
there's,

2879
02:00:12,520 --> 02:00:16,750
there's energy that comes out of people 
sometimes that is absolutely tangible.

2880
02:00:16,751 --> 02:00:18,460
We just don't have a device to measure 
it.

2881
02:00:18,490 --> 02:00:18,890
Well,
these,

2882
02:00:19,180 --> 02:00:24,180
the other thing they did,
they set up these random number 

2883
02:00:24,180 --> 02:00:26,161
generators all around the world and so 
they sent them all around the world and 

2884
02:00:26,161 --> 02:00:30,480
then just coincidentally a nine slash 11
happened because they had a theory that 

2885
02:00:30,790 --> 02:00:34,330
if large numbers of people were thinking
about the same event,

2886
02:00:35,020 --> 02:00:40,020
that that would have a larger impact on 
these machines and they found the 

2887
02:00:40,451 --> 02:00:45,451
correlation.
They found that at the time of nine 

2888
02:00:45,451 --> 02:00:46,860
slash 11 when the towers fell,
um,

2889
02:00:47,410 --> 02:00:52,410
these machines all around the world 
started generating nonrandom sequences 

2890
02:00:52,410 --> 02:00:52,410
of numbers.

2891
02:00:54,160 --> 02:00:56,660
And what does that mean?
Just that they don't really.

2892
02:00:56,740 --> 02:00:59,400
All they know is this is like the men 
that they said that,

2893
02:00:59,440 --> 02:01:04,440
that just the effect of everyone paying 
attention to the same event a affected 

2894
02:01:04,451 --> 02:01:05,620
these machines.
Okay.

2895
02:01:05,621 --> 02:01:10,621
So what you're saying is that all these 
people were supposed to be paying 

2896
02:01:10,621 --> 02:01:13,981
attention to the machines and then the 
event of nine slash 11 happened and 

2897
02:01:13,981 --> 02:01:15,280
because it was such a huge event,
all these people are focusing on this.

2898
02:01:15,460 --> 02:01:17,710
And then that stopped being random.
The event.

2899
02:01:17,711 --> 02:01:22,711
Yeah.
Just the fact that people were all 

2900
02:01:22,711 --> 02:01:22,711
focused on the same event affected these
machines.

2901
02:01:22,711 --> 02:01:23,170
Wow.
It's crazy.

2902
02:01:23,300 --> 02:01:24,550
Yeah.
That's fascinating.

2903
02:01:24,551 --> 02:01:25,110
Shit.
Yeah.

2904
02:01:25,111 --> 02:01:30,111
And they found it the same thing.
They also found out at a camp that was 

2905
02:01:30,111 --> 02:01:30,111
in Canada,
Prime Minister Trudeau,

2906
02:01:30,111 --> 02:01:34,761
his funeral in Canada,
that when his son was giving the eulogy 

2907
02:01:34,761 --> 02:01:38,040
that there was a,
an effect because you had almost every 

2908
02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:38,810
single person in Canada listening to 
the,

2909
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:40,510
you know,

2910
02:01:41,180 --> 02:01:43,520
you know,
the idea is really fascinating to me.

2911
02:01:43,560 --> 02:01:45,830
You familiar with ray?
Kurt's we'll do,

2912
02:01:45,831 --> 02:01:48,860
you know,
the clarity is near when you know he's,

2913
02:01:48,980 --> 02:01:53,980
he's the number one proponent of the 
idea of the intelligent computer 

2914
02:01:53,980 --> 02:01:56,450
eventually taking over and that's what 
he deems a singularity to be and what he

2915
02:01:56,451 --> 02:01:58,970
thinks is that what immortality is going
to be.

2916
02:01:59,210 --> 02:02:04,210
It's going to be able to download your 
consciousness into some sort of a 

2917
02:02:04,210 --> 02:02:07,061
computer and you know,
it sounds completely ridiculous until 

2918
02:02:07,061 --> 02:02:11,111
you start thinking about the what,
what the fuck is consciousness and what 

2919
02:02:11,111 --> 02:02:11,440
if they can recreate,
it would,

2920
02:02:11,550 --> 02:02:11,900
it,
would have,

2921
02:02:11,901 --> 02:02:16,901
you can recreate and create an 
artificial version of consciousness down

2922
02:02:17,181 --> 02:02:22,181
to the point of it being non local down 
to the point of this computer that 

2923
02:02:22,181 --> 02:02:25,310
you've created being an antenna to tune 
in this new sort of conscious.

2924
02:02:25,390 --> 02:02:26,260
Yeah.
Well,

2925
02:02:26,261 --> 02:02:27,040
it was,
uh,

2926
02:02:27,041 --> 02:02:32,041
I remember once talking about computers 
continue to advance the rate they're 

2927
02:02:32,041 --> 02:02:35,191
doing.
I don't remember if it was Chris that 

2928
02:02:35,191 --> 02:02:35,191
puts for two,
but the idea that,

2929
02:02:35,191 --> 02:02:38,660
that eventually there'll be a computer 
powerful enough to have stored in his 

2930
02:02:38,660 --> 02:02:42,931
memory banks,
every single event that has occurred 

2931
02:02:42,931 --> 02:02:47,551
since the big bang,
which means like every event in every 

2932
02:02:47,551 --> 02:02:47,551
human being's life,
every,

2933
02:02:47,551 --> 02:02:52,050
every interaction of matter throughout 
the universe could be stored on a 

2934
02:02:52,050 --> 02:02:53,470
single,
can be extrapolated based on the current

2935
02:02:53,471 --> 02:02:58,471
events and his.
And he said that the program itself 

2936
02:02:58,471 --> 02:02:59,740
would not be able to distinguish itself 
from the original.

2937
02:03:00,390 --> 02:03:05,390
Wow.
So each of us would be programmed into 

2938
02:03:05,390 --> 02:03:08,551
this computer's memory bank and the 
program of us would not be able to 

2939
02:03:09,101 --> 02:03:14,101
distinguish itself from the original,
which means that right now we might 

2940
02:03:14,711 --> 02:03:17,620
already be that program.
A billion years in the future

2941
02:03:18,050 --> 02:03:21,380
may very well be some sort of a parallel
reality.

2942
02:03:21,400 --> 02:03:21,940
Well,
we may have,

2943
02:03:21,941 --> 02:03:26,941
we may have lived our actual,
a carbon based life a billion years ago.

2944
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:33,000
And right now we might just be the 
computer program being run a billion 

2945
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:33,000
years later.
So

2946
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:34,730
whoa,
what a mind fuck.

2947
02:03:34,820 --> 02:03:39,820
I saw a trip,
I saw a glitch in the matrix the other 

2948
02:03:39,820 --> 02:03:39,820
day and this is kind of like this.
I,

2949
02:03:39,820 --> 02:03:44,191
I was outside in,
it was the moon and there was these 

2950
02:03:44,191 --> 02:03:44,191
clouds going over it after a rain storm.
Right.

2951
02:03:44,360 --> 02:03:46,430
And have you ever seen like on satellite
TV,

2952
02:03:46,431 --> 02:03:49,410
like we're like darker scenes,
like blacks and grays.

2953
02:03:49,411 --> 02:03:51,920
They're not just black or gray,
it's like kinda like blocky,

2954
02:03:51,940 --> 02:03:56,940
like boxes.
I was looking at that and it was doing 

2955
02:03:56,940 --> 02:03:57,370
that and I'm like,
why am I seeing blocky?

2956
02:03:57,420 --> 02:03:59,990
Like your eyes are programmed to see 
that.

2957
02:03:59,991 --> 02:04:00,630
I don't know.
Yeah,

2958
02:04:00,631 --> 02:04:05,631
I do.
I see so much computer and TV that was 

2959
02:04:05,631 --> 02:04:07,751
doing.
But it was really like I was staring at 

2960
02:04:07,751 --> 02:04:07,751
going,
there's no reason those are squares.

2961
02:04:07,751 --> 02:04:08,750
Those are blocks.
Like the shadowing was off.

2962
02:04:08,751 --> 02:04:09,710
And I'm thinking,
wait a second,

2963
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,520
this is some kind of say my friend 
Duncan hit

2964
02:04:12,540 --> 02:04:15,760
me with the ultimate mindfuck once.
And that is the theory that,

2965
02:04:16,060 --> 02:04:17,810
that you,
uh,

2966
02:04:17,860 --> 02:04:22,860
that your life,
like as the world gets more and more 

2967
02:04:22,860 --> 02:04:23,860
fucked up and more and more chaotic and 
you worry about the future of the world,

2968
02:04:24,070 --> 02:04:26,290
that's really your own mortality.
That you're,

2969
02:04:26,291 --> 02:04:27,550
you're,
you're tripping on that.

2970
02:04:27,551 --> 02:04:31,030
You have created this entire universe 
around you.

2971
02:04:31,210 --> 02:04:32,370
And even though,
uh,

2972
02:04:32,510 --> 02:04:36,010
it seems real because there's a bunch of
people in your life that also seem real.

2973
02:04:36,310 --> 02:04:41,310
They in your dream as much as you exist 
in there and it's all some sort of a 

2974
02:04:41,310 --> 02:04:43,480
symbiotic connection,
but that you,

2975
02:04:43,500 --> 02:04:47,850
you live and are reborn constantly.
And then every time something happens to

2976
02:04:47,851 --> 02:04:52,851
you,
whether it's some sort of a car 

2977
02:04:52,851 --> 02:04:52,851
accident,
some you know,

2978
02:04:52,851 --> 02:04:52,851
you die in a building,
collapsed.

2979
02:04:52,851 --> 02:04:56,150
Anything that happens,
you immediately forget it,

2980
02:04:56,220 --> 02:05:01,220
forget it.
And you are transported into another 

2981
02:05:01,220 --> 02:05:03,771
situation where you already have this 
life going on and you just step in and 

2982
02:05:03,771 --> 02:05:03,771
just keep going.

2983
02:05:03,771 --> 02:05:05,700
And that it never ends.
And there is no death.

2984
02:05:05,940 --> 02:05:09,420
And it's just a constant cycle until you
get your shit together,

2985
02:05:09,650 --> 02:05:12,000
until you completely and totally 
evolved.

2986
02:05:12,270 --> 02:05:16,800
And that this illusion that you've been 
around for 40 years or 50 years,

2987
02:05:16,801 --> 02:05:17,830
it's all nonsense.
You know,

2988
02:05:17,831 --> 02:05:20,070
you'd been around forever.
You've been around forever.

2989
02:05:20,071 --> 02:05:22,080
That's the old soul notion.
Yeah.

2990
02:05:22,280 --> 02:05:23,140
You know,
look,

2991
02:05:23,280 --> 02:05:25,280
we have a very limited amount of 
memories that we can,

2992
02:05:25,320 --> 02:05:28,200
can access about this life that we're 
pretty sure happened,

2993
02:05:28,720 --> 02:05:33,720
you know,
and none of them that we can access 

2994
02:05:33,720 --> 02:05:36,051
during the sleep time.
Just imagine if someone came up with a 

2995
02:05:36,051 --> 02:05:38,100
drug that would allow you to remember 
your sleep and details.

2996
02:05:38,160 --> 02:05:43,160
Remember your dreams in.
Absolutely didn't want to see half the 

2997
02:05:43,160 --> 02:05:45,771
shit.
I don't want to fucking argue was 

2998
02:05:45,771 --> 02:05:47,900
already with talking today.
How he had a dream the other day about 

2999
02:05:47,900 --> 02:05:47,900
having sex with his sister.
And I'm like,

3000
02:05:47,900 --> 02:05:47,900
oh,
I'd see.

3001
02:05:47,900 --> 02:05:50,160
That's the kind of Shit I don't want to 
even know that I'm dreaming about.

3002
02:05:50,161 --> 02:05:52,740
You know?
Did he say it was good?

3003
02:05:53,950 --> 02:05:55,440
It came a couple of times.
Nice.

3004
02:05:55,441 --> 02:05:56,140
Yeah.
So David,

3005
02:05:56,150 --> 02:05:58,620
if anybody wants to go see you perform,
where can they,

3006
02:05:58,650 --> 02:05:59,720
how can they get ahold of you?
I know your,

3007
02:05:59,850 --> 02:06:04,850
your twitter is Dave s Foley F o l e y.
and how can they get ahold of you?

3008
02:06:05,101 --> 02:06:05,760
You have a website?

3009
02:06:05,840 --> 02:06:06,950
Uh,
no I don't,

3010
02:06:06,951 --> 02:06:08,210
I,
I've got facebook,

3011
02:06:08,211 --> 02:06:13,211
but that's kind of useless.
We're going to have to get a website if 

3012
02:06:13,211 --> 02:06:15,720
you're going to do standup,
but just the twitter and a.

3013
02:06:15,720 --> 02:06:15,720
and so

3014
02:06:15,720 --> 02:06:17,660
the plan is to um,
uh,

3015
02:06:18,030 --> 02:06:21,740
do some gigs to put together a set and 
then go to her and then.

3016
02:06:21,760 --> 02:06:26,760
Yeah.
And then actually start playing actual 

3017
02:06:26,760 --> 02:06:26,760
comedy clubs.
Are you ready?

3018
02:06:26,760 --> 02:06:29,731
I mean,
do you felt like you did this thing the 

3019
02:06:29,731 --> 02:06:29,731
other night?
How would it have to go?

3020
02:06:29,731 --> 02:06:30,430
Well,
it was like I under,

3021
02:06:30,431 --> 02:06:33,100
I,
I overestimated the amount of stuff that

3022
02:06:33,101 --> 02:06:38,101
I had in my notes.
So I was like about 15 minutes shy when 

3023
02:06:38,101 --> 02:06:38,101
I got,
you know,

3024
02:06:38,101 --> 02:06:42,811
then it went all right.
And it's like I just sort of pulled out 

3025
02:06:42,811 --> 02:06:45,961
some stuff I've been working okay.
But I had like a notes that I hadn't 

3026
02:06:45,961 --> 02:06:49,800
timed outside as well.
I think this is going to be about 45 

3027
02:06:49,800 --> 02:06:50,940
minutes of stuff in these notes and turn
out to be half an hour it true.

3028
02:06:51,010 --> 02:06:51,880
Yeah.
Yeah.

3029
02:06:52,030 --> 02:06:53,590
And um,
so then,

3030
02:06:53,820 --> 02:06:58,820
so then I had to sort of quickly just 
grabbed and other bits that I hadn't 

3031
02:06:58,820 --> 02:07:00,670
planned to do as well as I could 
remember it.

3032
02:07:01,060 --> 02:07:03,070
And then improvise a little digital 
recorder set.

3033
02:07:03,370 --> 02:07:03,940
Uh,
yeah.

3034
02:07:04,060 --> 02:07:05,010
Yeah.
So you're,

3035
02:07:05,050 --> 02:07:07,960
your main motivation initially was just 
financial,

3036
02:07:08,050 --> 02:07:09,280
but now you're enjoying it.

3037
02:07:09,410 --> 02:07:10,220
Yeah,
I'm enjoying it.

3038
02:07:10,221 --> 02:07:13,490
It's feels good to an extent not,
I've never been a person who,

3039
02:07:13,700 --> 02:07:16,760
who like really craves performing,
you know,

3040
02:07:16,810 --> 02:07:17,270
I,
you know,

3041
02:07:17,271 --> 02:07:18,350
I,
I can enjoy it,

3042
02:07:18,351 --> 02:07:20,030
but I never like,
I never get this thing,

3043
02:07:20,031 --> 02:07:21,290
oh,
I got to be on stage.

3044
02:07:21,740 --> 02:07:23,360
Um,
but I've been,

3045
02:07:23,390 --> 02:07:24,560
yeah,
it's been really fun,

3046
02:07:24,770 --> 02:07:26,660
especially because it's been such a 
dark,

3047
02:07:26,690 --> 02:07:29,300
horrible year and a half this past year 
and a half.

3048
02:07:29,470 --> 02:07:30,550
Fuck is,
you know,

3049
02:07:30,551 --> 02:07:33,840
it's amazing you saying that because it 
was dark and horrible when I knew you in

3050
02:07:33,850 --> 02:07:36,310
94 and this was an

3051
02:07:36,740 --> 02:07:39,760
and that was nothing like this last year
and a half has been the worst year and a

3052
02:07:39,760 --> 02:07:41,820
half of my life.
I'm like,

3053
02:07:42,160 --> 02:07:43,390
really?
I'm,

3054
02:07:44,540 --> 02:07:45,400
you know,
it's,

3055
02:07:45,480 --> 02:07:46,020
you know,
it's,

3056
02:07:46,060 --> 02:07:49,780
it's,
I'm not exaggerating when I say I have,

3057
02:07:49,781 --> 02:07:51,760
I hadn't gotten through it.
I wouldn't have been surprised,

3058
02:07:51,790 --> 02:07:53,050
you know?
Wow.

3059
02:07:53,110 --> 02:07:55,090
You know,
it was that you thought about.

3060
02:07:55,150 --> 02:07:56,290
Oh yeah.
Suicide.

3061
02:07:56,320 --> 02:07:57,160
Oh,
tons.

3062
02:07:57,220 --> 02:07:58,510
Tons Times.
Fuck.

3063
02:07:58,511 --> 02:08:00,940
Most of the time.
Well you have my number now.

3064
02:08:00,990 --> 02:08:02,170
Yeah,
don't do that.

3065
02:08:02,171 --> 02:08:02,860
Oh No,
I wouldn't.

3066
02:08:02,970 --> 02:08:03,820
I couldn't do it,
you know,

3067
02:08:03,821 --> 02:08:05,200
the main thing was,
and it wasn't even like,

3068
02:08:05,370 --> 02:08:06,840
look,
I'm going to prevent your suicide.

3069
02:08:07,100 --> 02:08:12,100
What a ridiculous.
You have my number now have no more 

3070
02:08:12,100 --> 02:08:12,130
concerned,
but it really was.

3071
02:08:12,131 --> 02:08:12,370
I mean,
I,

3072
02:08:12,480 --> 02:08:17,480
you know,
I have an eight year old daughter and a 

3073
02:08:17,480 --> 02:08:17,480
seven year old daughter.
She'll be eight soon.

3074
02:08:17,480 --> 02:08:19,360
It was like gone and it's that thing I 
kept getting hurt her so badly,

3075
02:08:19,810 --> 02:08:20,030
you know?

3076
02:08:20,570 --> 02:08:22,390
And that was,
that was the only thing,

3077
02:08:22,450 --> 02:08:23,370
you know,
my teenagers.

3078
02:08:23,410 --> 02:08:25,090
I figured they really wouldn't care too 
much,

3079
02:08:25,510 --> 02:08:26,680
you know.
Do you,

3080
02:08:26,681 --> 02:08:28,120
uh,
do you exercise at all?

3081
02:08:28,310 --> 02:08:29,440
Huh?
Do you exercise?

3082
02:08:29,470 --> 02:08:33,760
Obviously not.
I'm going to start eating.

3083
02:08:33,790 --> 02:08:34,690
Yeah.
Yeah.

3084
02:08:35,140 --> 02:08:36,060
Well actually,
because I just,

3085
02:08:36,490 --> 02:08:37,900
you know,
now I'm actually feeling pretty good.

3086
02:08:37,930 --> 02:08:39,760
Standup is making me feel better.
Sure.

3087
02:08:39,790 --> 02:08:40,600
Like,
so,

3088
02:08:40,710 --> 02:08:42,190
so a huge rush,
you know,

3089
02:08:42,230 --> 02:08:44,470
and great just being on stage and being 
funny,

3090
02:08:44,510 --> 02:08:47,320
remembering the reason I started doing 
this,

3091
02:08:47,350 --> 02:08:51,050
the reason that I liked doing it as that
it's fun to.

3092
02:08:51,051 --> 02:08:56,051
It's funny and it's,
you're creating positive energy and a 

3093
02:08:56,051 --> 02:08:57,780
positive environment.
You're giving someone something,

3094
02:08:57,810 --> 02:08:59,670
you're changing their state.
Yes.

3095
02:08:59,710 --> 02:09:02,890
And uh,
and I just booked a pilot which is nice.

3096
02:09:02,920 --> 02:09:04,750
Nice.
Was a show called how to be a gentleman.

3097
02:09:05,080 --> 02:09:08,470
Nice.
Which is a good script and funny.

3098
02:09:08,471 --> 02:09:13,471
And so obviously these secret does work 
because I put out some positive energy 

3099
02:09:13,900 --> 02:09:14,730
and now I got show.

3100
02:09:14,820 --> 02:09:17,650
Well,
maintaining your body is so important.

3101
02:09:17,651 --> 02:09:18,290
Your body.
Yeah.

3102
02:09:18,330 --> 02:09:23,330
Fucking trick.
You and your body can betray you 

3103
02:09:23,330 --> 02:09:25,690
whenever there's times of stress,
all those chemicals or they think you're

3104
02:09:25,691 --> 02:09:27,520
going to have to fight off a cheetah or 
something.

3105
02:09:27,521 --> 02:09:29,800
You know what I mean?
Chemicals don't realize that,

3106
02:09:29,801 --> 02:09:34,801
oh,
you're just dealing with a legal 

3107
02:09:34,801 --> 02:09:34,801
entanglement.
So it's like,

3108
02:09:34,801 --> 02:09:34,801
and I've spent most of my life going,
okay,

3109
02:09:34,801 --> 02:09:39,571
body,
can you take this if I neglect you and 

3110
02:09:39,941 --> 02:09:41,950
abuse you this way?
Right?

3111
02:09:42,370 --> 02:09:43,060
So,
uh,

3112
02:09:43,061 --> 02:09:45,130
what do you plan on doing like yogurt or
something like that?

3113
02:09:45,131 --> 02:09:50,131
What do you,
what's the idea for what about just 

3114
02:09:50,131 --> 02:09:50,680
getting on an exercise?
I bike.

3115
02:09:50,870 --> 02:09:55,750
I actually joined a gym but I haven't 
been but actually have joined like the,

3116
02:09:55,751 --> 02:09:56,440
you know,
the gym,

3117
02:09:56,530 --> 02:09:59,110
a gym downtown,
a iphone.

3118
02:09:59,200 --> 02:10:01,990
Make it so fucking fascinating.
It makes it so much better.

3119
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:07,000
Put on a podcast,
and I know a lot of people listen to 

3120
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,251
this podcast.
There's probably people ironically at 

3121
02:10:09,251 --> 02:10:09,480
the gym struggling through it right now,
listening to you on,

3122
02:10:09,600 --> 02:10:11,070
on their iphone.
I know there are then.

3123
02:10:11,080 --> 02:10:15,940
I'm sorry about the middle part of this 
conversation with my harder.

3124
02:10:16,360 --> 02:10:20,600
I could probably listen man.
Other people's trauma and struggles.

3125
02:10:20,630 --> 02:10:21,310
It's,
it's a,

3126
02:10:21,311 --> 02:10:23,320
it's a beneficial.
You can learn from that.

3127
02:10:23,950 --> 02:10:25,150
You can learn a lot,
drink a lot.

3128
02:10:25,151 --> 02:10:26,350
Like I didn't hide it.

3129
02:10:28,890 --> 02:10:32,170
A couple of fucking cats and a dog.
You have no entanglements.

3130
02:10:32,171 --> 02:10:33,440
You have no worries.
This should.

3131
02:10:33,960 --> 02:10:34,050
I'm

3132
02:10:34,070 --> 02:10:35,510
a single mom.
What are you talking about?

3133
02:10:35,511 --> 02:10:40,511
I have to fucking take my.
After last night I got pretty drunk and 

3134
02:10:40,511 --> 02:10:43,931
I will have to wake up at 8:00
AM to let my dog out and sit there with 

3135
02:10:43,931 --> 02:10:43,931
the worst hangover.
Felt like puking.

3136
02:10:43,940 --> 02:10:48,940
Then go back to bed for awhile.
Mother fucker took malaria medication 

3137
02:10:48,940 --> 02:10:49,700
and went to Morocco and though I'm 
saying,

3138
02:10:49,701 --> 02:10:52,910
I'm saying like,
it's like I'm a full time single mom and

3139
02:10:53,010 --> 02:10:54,500
it's fucking annoying

3140
02:10:55,170 --> 02:10:58,930
a baby and you need to join the marine.
You're a baby.

3141
02:10:58,931 --> 02:11:01,890
You need to join the fucking marines.
Need to learn some discipline.

3142
02:11:02,300 --> 02:11:05,940
Go to have opened the doors.
My Dog can pee.

3143
02:11:06,020 --> 02:11:07,270
No,
that's set up there.

3144
02:11:07,280 --> 02:11:08,740
I'm anyone.
Yeah.

3145
02:11:08,770 --> 02:11:13,770
No having pets.
It really is nothing like having 

3146
02:11:13,770 --> 02:11:16,681
children is absolutely nothing.
Like I leave my dogs outside all the 

3147
02:11:16,681 --> 02:11:17,380
time.
I don't give a fuck.

3148
02:11:17,840 --> 02:11:19,750
You can't leave my kid anywhere.
No.

3149
02:11:19,751 --> 02:11:21,550
That's the thing.
You learn when you do have kids.

3150
02:11:21,570 --> 02:11:22,520
It's like,
you know,

3151
02:11:22,610 --> 02:11:24,400
you really realize,
oh my pets.

3152
02:11:24,790 --> 02:11:27,270
I love them,
but they're disposable.

3153
02:11:27,280 --> 02:11:31,540
Can Die.
They can die now and a and I'll feel bad

3154
02:11:31,541 --> 02:11:34,000
for a day.
You know,

3155
02:11:34,420 --> 02:11:35,320
we use.
It wasn't me.

3156
02:11:36,520 --> 02:11:39,070
At least it wasn't me or my family.
Yeah,

3157
02:11:39,071 --> 02:11:44,071
but it's amazing when I see women just 
suppressing that maternal instinct with 

3158
02:11:44,071 --> 02:11:44,590
children,
but they have a bunch of fucking cats or

3159
02:11:44,591 --> 02:11:46,030
dogs or something like that.
They are.

3160
02:11:46,031 --> 02:11:47,680
My children know they aren't your 
children.

3161
02:11:47,730 --> 02:11:50,770
They don't.
They give dave a fleshlight to bitch.

3162
02:11:50,810 --> 02:11:52,510
Yeah,
keep out of trouble.

3163
02:11:52,511 --> 02:11:53,960
You're talking about.
Yeah.

3164
02:11:54,340 --> 02:11:56,090
If you still too long they'll eat you.
Yeah.

3165
02:11:56,180 --> 02:11:56,810
So,
um,

3166
02:11:56,840 --> 02:11:58,550
if people want to get ahold of you,
Dave,

3167
02:11:58,551 --> 02:12:03,551
s Foley on twitter and you will be 
updating people as to where they could 

3168
02:12:03,551 --> 02:12:03,551
see you doing standup?
Yes.

3169
02:12:03,551 --> 02:12:08,480
Yeah.
How often are you going to be doing 

3170
02:12:08,480 --> 02:12:08,480
this?

3171
02:12:08,480 --> 02:12:08,480
I'm,
I'm,

3172
02:12:08,480 --> 02:12:11,520
I'm getting at least a couple,
a couple of times a week and I'm going 

3173
02:12:11,520 --> 02:12:11,520

come Wednesday,

3174
02:12:11,520 --> 02:12:11,920
getting it more.
I'd like to do the Wednesday.

3175
02:12:11,940 --> 02:12:12,940
Do you want to come?
It's fun.

3176
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:18,000
It's really supportive crowd.
I'm going to do a set on doing Doug 

3177
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:19,240
Benson show his.
Doug Benson loves movies.

3178
02:12:19,310 --> 02:12:20,350
Oh yeah,
I've done that before.

3179
02:12:20,351 --> 02:12:21,010
That's great.
Yeah.

3180
02:12:21,011 --> 02:12:24,670
I'm doing that tomorrow and then after 
that I'm going to do a set,

3181
02:12:24,671 --> 02:12:27,130
but I can't remember where.
See that's Wednesday.

3182
02:12:27,131 --> 02:12:28,710
Doug's going to be doing it too,
so

3183
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:29,950
yeah,
Doug does it all the time.

3184
02:12:30,440 --> 02:12:33,150
Yeah.
So combined if you can in any way.

3185
02:12:33,470 --> 02:12:34,830
Listen,
I just want to tell you,

3186
02:12:35,250 --> 02:12:40,250
I've worked with a lot of people over my
life over the course of my life and you 

3187
02:12:40,250 --> 02:12:42,270
were one of my favorite human beings 
I've ever met.

3188
02:12:42,630 --> 02:12:47,130
Working with you was a huge pleasure and
I really don't think that you get nearly

3189
02:12:47,131 --> 02:12:49,530
as much credit as you deserve for,
for news radio.

3190
02:12:49,531 --> 02:12:51,780
I don't think it would've ever been what
it was without you.

3191
02:12:52,130 --> 02:12:55,980
When I say that you were responsible for
half of what happened on that show.

3192
02:12:55,981 --> 02:12:57,630
I'm not exaggerating.
I know you think you will.

3193
02:12:57,660 --> 02:12:59,250
I am,
but you just don't remember.

3194
02:12:59,510 --> 02:13:04,510
You know,
you were the secret producer of news 

3195
02:13:04,510 --> 02:13:04,510
radio,
you know,

3196
02:13:04,510 --> 02:13:04,880
and you're just a brilliant guy and I'm 
glad you did

3197
02:13:04,910 --> 02:13:06,100
came on the podcast.
You know,

3198
02:13:06,150 --> 02:13:07,900
I love you very much,

02:13:15,690 --> 02:13:16,980
Not yet,

3204
02:13:17,010 --> 02:13:19,650
I'm willing to love me.
I'm willing to try.

3205
02:13:19,710 --> 02:13:24,710
We can hate women together and I'd love 
he doesn't hate when I do a couple of 

3206
02:13:24,710 --> 02:13:24,710
them,

3207
02:13:24,710 --> 02:13:26,610
couple of crazy ones.
And he hates their disease.

3208
02:13:26,670 --> 02:13:28,020
It doesn't hate them.
Yeah.

3209
02:13:28,270 --> 02:13:28,960
Alright.
And uh,

3210
02:13:29,010 --> 02:13:30,960

3217

revolutionary ideas like,

3219
02:13:51,091 --> 02:13:53,180
they're sponsored by a rubber posting.
Um,

3220
02:13:53,460 --> 02:13:54,270

Rudy Hill,
the RSL club,

3224
02:14:01,620 --> 02:14:03,300
and uh,
the first one sold out.

3225
02:14:03,301 --> 02:14:05,460
The second one.
I still think there's a few tickets that

3226
02:14:05,461 --> 02:14:06,630
are available.
So you,

3227
