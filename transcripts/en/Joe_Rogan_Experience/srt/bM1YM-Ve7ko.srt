1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,670
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:02,211
Yeah.

3
00:00:02,211 --> 00:00:02,690
Well,

4
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:02,931
you know,

5
00:00:02,931 --> 00:00:03,681
it's a fucking sick,

6
00:00:03,681 --> 00:00:04,250
John Man.

7
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:04,401
Yeah,

8
00:00:04,401 --> 00:00:04,551
no,

9
00:00:04,551 --> 00:00:04,971
I get it.

10
00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:05,571
But honestly,

11
00:00:05,571 --> 00:00:06,404
come you like,

12
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,350
I liked family tides.

13
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,110
I'm not even fucking around.

14
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,330
Like I liked family ties.

15
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:13,140
Uh,

16
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,840
but that's about d like
two and a half men.

17
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:16,951
Ah,

18
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:19,050
I'll say this for two and a half men.

19
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,140
I've seen it on mute a few times on the
plane and it looks like they're having a

20
00:00:24,781 --> 00:00:25,614
good time.

21
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,960
Then maybe the best answer anyone
has ever to their questions.

22
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:35,070
And then occasionally I'll hear like
a Dick joke and I'm always like,

23
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:37,440
that's a pretty strong dick joke for the,

24
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:37,831
for,

25
00:00:37,831 --> 00:00:39,420
for a sitcom at that time slot.

26
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,920
I only watched it once recently and I
thought it was the most unbearable thing

27
00:00:42,921 --> 00:00:45,620
I'd ever seen on television and I
thought it was incredible that it's so

28
00:00:45,621 --> 00:00:46,220
popular.

29
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,210
We were talking about it yesterday.

30
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:47,351
I,

31
00:00:47,351 --> 00:00:47,621
I'm,

32
00:00:47,621 --> 00:00:47,840
I'm,

33
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,770
I was baffled by it.

34
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,350
I couldn't believe how bad the jokes were.

35
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:52,131
I was like,

36
00:00:52,131 --> 00:00:52,820
this is just,

37
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,620
this is just an alien language,

38
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:54,981
right?

39
00:00:54,981 --> 00:00:57,740
I'm watching it with my mouth open and
I'm hearing the laugh track and I'm like,

40
00:00:57,741 --> 00:00:59,000
this isn't even my language.

41
00:00:59,001 --> 00:00:59,640
Like what the fuck?

42
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,280
If you don't watch your show with a laugh
track for a while and then you do it,

43
00:01:03,281 --> 00:01:03,990
you're like,

44
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:04,550
yeah,

45
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:08,960
I would like to watch it and have it all
the laughs extracted like someone do it

46
00:01:08,961 --> 00:01:09,860
through pro tools,

47
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:10,311
go in there,

48
00:01:10,311 --> 00:01:15,080
extract all the labs and just have him
say the the jokes and have no response

49
00:01:15,081 --> 00:01:17,000
and see how fucking bizarre

50
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:18,610
I want him to do that.

51
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:23,611
Where every po you take the laughs out
and then every punch line I just go Bam.

52
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,770
See like curb your enthusiasm
has no laugh track.

53
00:01:29,771 --> 00:01:30,280
You know?

54
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,150
And it's hilarious.

55
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:36,270
But if you did that with a show like two
and a half men take out all the laughs.

56
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:36,671
Yeah.

57
00:01:36,671 --> 00:01:38,710
And only have them act out the scene.

58
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,190
It's fucking preposterous.

59
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:41,050
But having said that,

60
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,501
cheers.

61
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:41,891
Had a laugh,

62
00:01:41,891 --> 00:01:42,870
track sign photo,

63
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,800
the laugh track friends had a laugh track.

64
00:01:44,801 --> 00:01:44,951
Hey,

65
00:01:44,951 --> 00:01:46,390
there's nothing wrong with a laugh track.

66
00:01:46,391 --> 00:01:48,460
What I'm saying is when
something's really horrible.

67
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:48,731
Yeah.

68
00:01:48,731 --> 00:01:49,840
And then you're just faking it.

69
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,190
Yeah.

70
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:50,771
And when,

71
00:01:50,771 --> 00:01:52,990
if you could just listen
to it without the laughter,

72
00:01:52,991 --> 00:01:53,824
it would be so

73
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,560
that's like that movie that looks like,

74
00:01:56,561 --> 00:01:57,280
uh,

75
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,730
the movie with them.

76
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,460
I always forget the guy's name,

77
00:02:00,461 --> 00:02:04,090
the guy from who hosted the
Oscars and he's handsome.

78
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:09,360
He wrestled growing these
steel steel robot boxers.

79
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,710
That looks good.

80
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,340
That is it.

81
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,420
I think it looks awesome.

82
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:16,090
It's like boxing match.

83
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,290
It's like a boxing the deck.

84
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:18,920
Rocky mixed the transformer.

85
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:23,470
Everyone looks like a real steel.

86
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:23,680
Yeah.

87
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,010
Rosio.

88
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,240
At first I thought it was a knock.

89
00:02:25,241 --> 00:02:25,841
'Em sock.

90
00:02:25,841 --> 00:02:26,560
'Em Mood.

91
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,250
It is.

92
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,210
And that's pretty much what it is.

93
00:02:28,211 --> 00:02:28,780
Yeah.

94
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,560
I thought it looked good.

95
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,220
Just cause I liked that.

96
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,150
Just transformers.

97
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:35,740
Hugh Jackman shirtless in the
real steel trailer at jam.

98
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,610
I want to see that bastard.

99
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,410
I'm a nerd.

100
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:40,320
You fucking ruined the
Wolverine Character,

101
00:02:40,321 --> 00:02:40,591
man.

102
00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:41,640
I don't care what anybody says.

103
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,650
Wolverine supposed to be like
five foot three and built like a,

104
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,270
I find those movies pitiful.

105
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,081
I find the odd,

106
00:02:48,081 --> 00:02:50,270
the fact that they can only
do superhero movies now,

107
00:02:50,271 --> 00:02:50,851
just pitiful.

108
00:02:50,851 --> 00:02:51,890
Like it's there.

109
00:02:51,891 --> 00:02:52,220
It's,

110
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:52,881
I told someone,

111
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:53,714
it's like,

112
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:58,220
it's there for dumb people to be
able to explain to other dumb people.

113
00:02:58,221 --> 00:03:03,221
Like there's a dude and he got bit by
a spider and he's half and half man.

114
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,070
And he wears a uniform.

115
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:08,440
So you're never confused about who's who.

116
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,810
And he's got a logo on the superman,

117
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:14,230
has a logo on the front and
the back in case you get them.

118
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,170
You're telling me you don't
like comic book movies,

119
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:17,590
man.

120
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:17,800
Uh,

121
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,440
I liked,

122
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,370
I'm such an old man.

123
00:03:19,371 --> 00:03:20,290
I liked the Chris Reeve.

124
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:21,124
Superman.

125
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:22,310
Whoa.

126
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,190
And uh,

127
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,490
which other ones have I liked?

128
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,320
I didn't like x men.

129
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,370
I didn't like know,

130
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,293
like Spiderman

131
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:29,660
didn't like,

132
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:29,750
oh,

133
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,220
I'm watching the trailer for this,

134
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,150
this rock 'em sock.

135
00:03:32,151 --> 00:03:33,230
'Em robots moving.

136
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,660
I like the Batman movies.

137
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,650
I like the new Batman.

138
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,480
I like the Tim Burton ones and I like the,

139
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:38,314
uh,

140
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,213
the,

141
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:39,790
the,

142
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:40,623
what does names?

143
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,210
Yeah.

144
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:41,481
This,

145
00:03:41,481 --> 00:03:42,141
by the way,

146
00:03:42,141 --> 00:03:45,980
this premise of this film where there's
robots and the people like where this

147
00:03:45,981 --> 00:03:48,110
robot outfit and get in fights.

148
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,460
It's a fucking great idea,

149
00:03:49,461 --> 00:03:50,060
man.

150
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,170
That's actually real robots.

151
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,321
Oh,

152
00:03:51,321 --> 00:03:52,041
these are robots in,

153
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:53,330
they're controlling them remotely.

154
00:03:53,331 --> 00:03:54,164
That's what it is.

155
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,101
No,

156
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:55,580
they're just,

157
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,620
they're just training robots idea.

158
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,400
Does it have avatar robot?

159
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,070
Yes.

160
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,830
We fucking awesome of Avatar robot fights.

161
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,281
To me,

162
00:04:05,281 --> 00:04:06,780
it's no different than racing cars.

163
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,340
You know what you're racing cars,

164
00:04:08,341 --> 00:04:08,581
you know,

165
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,970
you're not supposed to
be moving that fast.

166
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:10,650
You're using a machine,

167
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,483
move that fast,

168
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:11,761
you know,

169
00:04:11,761 --> 00:04:14,520
and you're bumping into each other and
cutting and cutting each other off.

170
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,890
In one of those that was in,

171
00:04:15,891 --> 00:04:16,724
uh,

172
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:17,421
it was in,

173
00:04:17,421 --> 00:04:18,254
um,

174
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,720
the end of x men or the end of,

175
00:04:20,721 --> 00:04:21,111
uh,

176
00:04:21,111 --> 00:04:21,500
of,

177
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,640
of uh,

178
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,230
ironman wasn't,

179
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:25,760
that wasn't Jeff Daniels and like,

180
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:26,723
uh,

181
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,390
didn't,

182
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,000
didn't I liked that movie too.

183
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,273
Uh,

184
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,240
yeah.

185
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:31,571
All right,

186
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:31,671
man.

187
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:32,031
It was fun,

188
00:04:32,031 --> 00:04:32,390
right?

189
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,810
Yeah.

190
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:33,800
He's a new Koni on it.

191
00:04:33,801 --> 00:04:34,340
Looks Fun.

192
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,200
A lot of people are shitting on it online.

193
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,300
It looks pretty fucking bad ass to me.

194
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,810
And they're like saying that they owe
that guy can't be cone and he's not built

195
00:04:41,811 --> 00:04:42,261
enough.

196
00:04:42,261 --> 00:04:42,861
He's not this.

197
00:04:42,861 --> 00:04:43,310
No.

198
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:47,710
Nobody really looked like Arnold
Schwarzenegger and I fucking 1500 BC.

199
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,320
Right.

200
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,490
That shit's unrealistic.

201
00:04:49,491 --> 00:04:50,360
No carbs.

202
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:50,800
Yeah,

203
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,630
it was just all red meat back then.

204
00:04:52,631 --> 00:04:54,070
He was on a strict diet in the,

205
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:54,540
in the,

206
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,440
in Paleolithic Times,

207
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,430
Paleo Diet,

208
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,230
Paleo.

209
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,920
That's what a lot of
people are doing right now.

210
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,430
So that's true.

211
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,140
It's all the rage.

212
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:01,760
You didn't know that.

213
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,530
That's a good book.

214
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,540
Paleo diet is all like vegetables.

215
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:05,470
No grains,

216
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,130
no rice.

217
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:06,820
Oh yes,

218
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,450
that's good.

219
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:10,240
It's all things that
are meat and vegetables.

220
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:10,630
You know,

221
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:14,620
things that people in the Paleolithic
would've eaten right before agriculture,

222
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,420
before hot dogs and shit.

223
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:17,763
Um,

224
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:18,371
yeah,

225
00:05:18,371 --> 00:05:18,701
those,

226
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:19,061
those,

227
00:05:19,061 --> 00:05:19,570
uh,

228
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,450
you think that that's,

229
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,453
I guess I'm,

230
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,293
I'm,

231
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,130
I'm out of touch with
what the people want.

232
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:25,431
Yeah.

233
00:05:25,431 --> 00:05:25,860
I,

234
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,150
uh,

235
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,430
I just a big fan of robots and,

236
00:05:28,431 --> 00:05:33,431
and good CGI is you're
a big fan of frogs now.

237
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,850
Doesn't it look like good CGI in a
financial way of looking at this movie?

238
00:05:37,851 --> 00:05:39,380
I think it's the most genius thing ever.

239
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,270
You're mixing like fighting like UFC,

240
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,660
mixing it like robots.

241
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,710
Like it was generated by a computer,

242
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,080
robots and fighting like the Pan,

243
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,740
a guy who had guys on,

244
00:05:52,741 --> 00:05:54,600
on his luck and then the,

245
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:55,220
you know,

246
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:55,850
yeah,

247
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:56,601
I see that too.

248
00:05:56,601 --> 00:05:57,434
I mean,

249
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,333
I don't know.

250
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,810
I think it's a good idea for kid,

251
00:05:59,811 --> 00:06:00,591
for a kid movie.

252
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:03,770
I'm guessing that's what this is kind
of like a teenager movie is good.

253
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,180
You mean a movie?

254
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,360
Cause that's their all for
all for these goddamn teens.

255
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,290
Teens.

256
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:09,531
No,

257
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:10,041
I've said,

258
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,470
I told somebody that if the
Godfather was released today,

259
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:13,720
Michael Corleone,

260
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,170
word a spandex suit,

261
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:16,850
she on it

262
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,960
and drive a fucking buy like a bat.

263
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:23,060
We'll be able to be like an Oldsmobile.

264
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,140
No via cannoli movie.

265
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,460
Giant Pinoli

266
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:28,880
sue the G on it.

267
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:29,893
Oh,

268
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,600
how funny would that be if
somebody pitch that in a meeting?

269
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,520
I just think he's the best.

270
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,383
I still,

271
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,261
everybody loves him.

272
00:06:36,261 --> 00:06:37,010
He's number one,

273
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:37,843
right?

274
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,473
It's different.

275
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:40,870
Yeah.

276
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:41,870
He puts it on.

277
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,440
He goes down,

278
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,330
he fucks up your nose.

279
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,810
You know who it is.

280
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,520
Everybody's got a costume.

281
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,390
Uh,

282
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:51,120
just a costume that retarded
people can understand.

283
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,740
That's superman.

284
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:54,601
You just go,

285
00:06:54,601 --> 00:06:54,961
oh yeah,

286
00:06:54,961 --> 00:06:55,770
he's fucking,

287
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:56,790
I'm retarded.

288
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,740
That definitely superman.

289
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:02,560
What is your take on this fucking
Spiderman thing that they're doing and

290
00:07:02,561 --> 00:07:03,200
Broadway,

291
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:03,620
you know,

292
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,000
you know the whole story behind this,

293
00:07:05,001 --> 00:07:06,500
the Spiderman play,

294
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:07,580
it's the biggest,

295
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:11,690
most expensive play they've ever
produced by far on Broadway.

296
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,500
And apparently it's a
fucking financial disaster

297
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:14,710
and,

298
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:15,630
and people are dying.

299
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,080
People get rid of their
fucking backs and shit.

300
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:20,783
I was,

301
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,380
if there was another accident,

302
00:07:22,381 --> 00:07:23,580
I was going to do a Twitter,

303
00:07:23,581 --> 00:07:28,410
a tweet where I'm Spiderman himself
came out and condemn the musical.

304
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:29,461
I was like,

305
00:07:29,461 --> 00:07:29,701
look,

306
00:07:29,701 --> 00:07:32,370
we've got to stop that as Spiderman.

307
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,200
Please give me a bad name.

308
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:34,890
That's funny.

309
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:35,041
Yeah,

310
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:37,860
no shit does the thing where
this is the guy's a hero.

311
00:07:37,861 --> 00:07:39,600
He wants to save people and it's fucking,

312
00:07:39,601 --> 00:07:41,740
and it is more people
have been injured then.

313
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:42,703
Yeah.

314
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,240
They've killed more people
than the Green Goblin.

315
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,000
Am I right?

316
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,833
Am I right ladies?

317
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:47,930
And they,

318
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:50,550
they're flying around
during this broadcast,

319
00:07:50,551 --> 00:07:51,930
right then there during this,

320
00:07:51,931 --> 00:07:52,280
uh,

321
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,160
this performance,

322
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,960
they fly around like they're on a,

323
00:07:54,961 --> 00:07:56,370
where they've reopened it,

324
00:07:56,371 --> 00:07:57,270
they're trying to just read,

325
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,310
they brought the original director back.

326
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,141
It's just a,

327
00:08:00,141 --> 00:08:00,631
it's like,

328
00:08:00,631 --> 00:08:01,050
hey,

329
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:01,741
you just want to say it.

330
00:08:01,741 --> 00:08:02,130
I'm like,

331
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:02,281
Hey,

332
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:03,690
you guys know you don't have to do this.

333
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,340
You're going to stop.

334
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:05,640
Right.

335
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,380
That is where I wanted to
like just maybe just stop.

336
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,370
It's hard though.

337
00:08:08,371 --> 00:08:09,570
Once you commit to something,

338
00:08:09,571 --> 00:08:10,500
it's pretty much over,

339
00:08:10,501 --> 00:08:11,310
you know?

340
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:14,150
It's very difficult to quit
something once you're rolling.

341
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,480
Admit that it's,

342
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,041
you know,

343
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:16,460
