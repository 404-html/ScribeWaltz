00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,140
You speak frequently
in your lectures about,

2
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:15,000
I guess the war between good and evil
or the struggle of life really is a

3
00:00:15,001 --> 00:00:19,650
struggle between good and evil being at
the core of a conscious lived existence.

4
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,920
And I guess on that note,

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,680
if you were 100% certain
that there was no afterlife,

6
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,190
would you still be able to preach that
there's a positive meeting in life?

7
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,440
If you're 100% certain,

8
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:42,030
some atheists seem to be 100% certain
and yet they still preach that there's

9
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:43,620
some positive meaning to life,

10
00:00:43,621 --> 00:00:46,370
would you be one of those
or would you turn into cane?

11
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,040
You know,

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,880
so cynical.

13
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,293
I think that,

14
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,530
well for as far as I'm concerned,

15
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,660
one of the things I learned from studying
20th century history is that like even

16
00:00:56,661 --> 00:01:00,230
if the idea that even if you
take the most cynical of ideas,

17
00:01:00,231 --> 00:01:05,231
let's say that life is irredeemable
suffering and perhaps isn't even justified

18
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,553
because of that,

19
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:12,380
it still seems to me that
you have an ethical duty,

20
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,440
let's say to live in a manner that
reduces that to the degree that that's

21
00:01:17,691 --> 00:01:18,524
possible.

22
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,030
And so,

23
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:23,600
and I think that that can be
experienced as meaningful in some sense

24
00:01:23,601 --> 00:01:26,060
independently of the transcendent context.

25
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:30,890
Now I don't exactly know how to strip
off the transcendent context because one

26
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:34,070
of the things I would say that's happened
to me is because I've spent so much

27
00:01:34,071 --> 00:01:37,880
time looking at the horrible things
that people have done is that it's like

28
00:01:37,881 --> 00:01:39,850
young said that he wanted,

29
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,090
this is one of his famous quotes.

30
00:01:41,091 --> 00:01:41,810
He said,

31
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,860
no tree can reach up to heaven unless
its roots reached down to hell.

32
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,630
And so as I've dug deeper into
the depravity of human beings,

33
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,520
my sense of the possibility of
human beings has also grown.

34
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:02,080
What would you say in proportion and
until I've become convinced actually that

35
00:02:02,691 --> 00:02:04,640
good is a more powerful force than evil,

36
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:07,700
even though evil is an
unbelievably powerful force.

37
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,360
And so I can't really
strip the transcended away.

38
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:14,150
Now whether what bearing that has
on eternity say on an afterlife?

39
00:02:14,151 --> 00:02:14,984
I mean,

40
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:15,993
I,

41
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:16,900
I,

42
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,500
I can't say anything about that.

43
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:22,970
The only thing I guess I can say is that
there are many things about being that

44
00:02:22,971 --> 00:02:24,500
we don't understand in the least.

45
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:29,000
And we don't understand the nature of
consciousness or the nature of time.

46
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,810
So I,

47
00:02:30,811 --> 00:02:31,430
I'm not,

48
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,080
I wouldn't despair about that,

49
00:02:33,081 --> 00:02:33,471
but yes,

50
00:02:33,471 --> 00:02:35,840
I think that life can still
be meaningful without,

51
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,830
without there being a
necessity of an afterlife.

52
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,400
So.
