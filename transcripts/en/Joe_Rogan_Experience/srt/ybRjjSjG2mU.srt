1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:02,140
Hello

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:02,973
bitches,

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:03,671
do you know,

4
00:00:03,671 --> 00:00:04,241
started the salt.

5
00:00:04,241 --> 00:00:04,340
No,

6
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,520
Dubai Sultan of Brunei rather soul,

7
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:08,443
no Bernai.

8
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,930
He would bring in gals and
pay them like $50,000 a month.

9
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,050
Just come on down and they
would go for a few months,

10
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,100
make quarter million bucks,

11
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:22,450
then fly home and they'd get all this
jewelry and diamonds and shit and one

12
00:00:22,451 --> 00:00:24,280
little hook or ruined the whole Party.

13
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:25,130
But she was the,

14
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:26,230
they caught it with a laptop,

15
00:00:26,231 --> 00:00:27,370
straightened stories about it.

16
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,120
She wanted to write a
book about her experience.

17
00:00:31,121 --> 00:00:31,780
So this dude,

18
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:32,351
this is what he would do.

19
00:00:32,351 --> 00:00:36,130
He had a disco in his house and
one of his many houses and uh,

20
00:00:36,131 --> 00:00:38,740
he would have it filled with
all these girls who are making,

21
00:00:38,741 --> 00:00:39,730
who knows how much money,

22
00:00:39,731 --> 00:00:43,510
just tens of thousands of dollars and
he would come out and he's fucking gold

23
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:47,200
underwear and just in slippers
and slide across the room.

24
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,780
Like he was in that scene with Tom Cruise.

25
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,680
Was that movie risky
business play slides in.

26
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,110
He'd slide in like that as gold
underwear and just go eeny,

27
00:00:56,111 --> 00:00:56,621
meeny,

28
00:00:56,621 --> 00:00:57,101
miny,

29
00:00:57,101 --> 00:00:57,311
moe,

30
00:00:57,311 --> 00:00:58,240
and just pick one out

31
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:04,770
and just fuck shit out of them and then
the next day do the same thing and he'd

32
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,660
do whatever he wants and that
chick wrote the story on it.

33
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,553
One of them did.

34
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:09,580
Wow.

35
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:10,443
Yeah.

36
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,003
And there's like,

37
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:12,620
so what?

38
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,530
I'm going back on him.

39
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:15,970
It's really him.

40
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:16,640
That's him.

41
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,510
Like pack Reagan.

42
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,920
That guy's totally covered in gold.

43
00:01:21,921 --> 00:01:22,754
Look at him.

44
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,770
That guy's worth more
money than you can ever.

45
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,210
Can I be one of these girls?

46
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:27,110
I'm like,

47
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:28,310
go away for 50,000.

48
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,410
I'm doing a Gig in Dubai
guys for a whole month.

49
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,640
You just want to be the court jester.

50
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:34,220
Go over there and crack some jokes,

51
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:35,151
man.

52
00:01:35,151 --> 00:01:37,310
That's fucking crazy.

53
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,720
And you think he wears a condom?

54
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,213
No,

55
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,143
no condom.

56
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,013
Shut up.

57
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,310
Why would he do that?

58
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:43,581
Yeah,

59
00:01:43,581 --> 00:01:44,210
exactly.

60
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,860
He's just shooting loads of these gals,

61
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,300
but then again,

62
00:01:47,301 --> 00:01:49,360
he's opening himself up for possible.

63
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,383
I wonder if they.

64
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,700
I bet he gets them tested.

65
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:54,770
He puts him in catapults
and shoots him in the air.

66
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,410
I am closer to being Lance Armstrong,

67
00:01:58,411 --> 00:02:00,410
like closest auto diets,

68
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,250
absent carbohydrates,

69
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,320
but I'm still,

70
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:04,681
you know,

71
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:06,360
now I'm just a bigger individual.

72
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:06,661
I mean,

73
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:07,351
it's interesting.

74
00:02:07,351 --> 00:02:08,310
We were talking about,

75
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,193
uh,

76
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,100
uh,

77
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:11,933
you know,

78
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,960
I was talking to a friend of mine who
was a freshman manager of my college

79
00:02:15,961 --> 00:02:16,681
football team.

80
00:02:16,681 --> 00:02:17,700
So this was harvard.

81
00:02:17,701 --> 00:02:17,971
Okay.

82
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,650
It was division two football.

83
00:02:19,651 --> 00:02:20,970
It was a lot of smart

84
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,840
guys who couldn't make it in division one.

85
00:02:24,841 --> 00:02:28,260
We had kids who went to Harvard because
they didn't get scholarships at Holy

86
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:28,261
Cross.

87
00:02:28,261 --> 00:02:28,651
So they went,

88
00:02:28,651 --> 00:02:28,921
okay,

89
00:02:28,921 --> 00:02:30,300
I'll play football for Harvard.

90
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:31,134
They were local

91
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,091
19,

92
00:02:33,091 --> 00:02:33,924
76.

93
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,711
My senior year,

94
00:02:34,711 --> 00:02:36,540
the biggest kid on our team,

95
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,900
Danny tickets weighed 265 pounds,

96
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,790
six foot five tomorrow standards.

97
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:43,710
Who was enormous.

98
00:02:43,711 --> 00:02:46,770
He went off to play for the Chicago
bears for five or six years.

99
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:52,260
I think we had one other
offenses Lineman who was to 65,

100
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,490
also six,

101
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:53,740
four,

102
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,040
six,

103
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,873
five,

104
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,100
maybe two this year.

105
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,300
Harvard football team,

106
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,181
smart kid,

107
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,220
same socioeconomic status.

108
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,070
The entire.

109
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:04,990
Oftentimes they get,

110
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:07,180
I think 12 players over 300 pounds.

111
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,670
Jesus cronies guys were enormous.

112
00:03:09,671 --> 00:03:09,851
I mean,

113
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:10,390
there are six,

114
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:10,930
seven,

115
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:11,763
300 pounds.

116
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,060
They didn't grow people that
big when I was growing up.

117
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,940
I mean I could say maybe I didn't see him.

118
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,800
Maybe they weren't around.

119
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:21,730
Maybe they were six,

120
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:24,760
seven and they only weighed 2:30
because they weren't being bulked up.

121
00:03:24,761 --> 00:03:27,280
So they were playing
basketball instead of football.

122
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,970
I mean I could imagine
ways that that confusing,

123
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:32,260
but from our perception,

124
00:03:32,261 --> 00:03:37,261
if you look just what happened when I
was a kid in early 19 sixties as far as I

125
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:39,311
know,

126
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:40,144
there was one,

127
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,980
300 pounder in the NFL and afl,

128
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,150
two different leads back then.

129
00:03:46,151 --> 00:03:47,800
Bob De remember his name,

130
00:03:47,801 --> 00:03:52,450
he played for the Boston Patriots and
his head was like small compared to his

131
00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:53,860
body and he was a big fat guy.

132
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:55,590
You know,

133
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,423
what is there now?

134
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,071
Twenty,

135
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:58,690
30 per team.

136
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,020
And you're saying like a
lot of people are saying no,

137
00:04:01,021 --> 00:04:03,660
there's sciences out because they're
spending billions of dollars to do that.

138
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:04,651
The thing is,

139
00:04:04,651 --> 00:04:06,870
is when you are playing such far right,

140
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,430
far left partisan politics,

141
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,410
then you have people saying,

142
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:11,363
oh,

143
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:12,180
uh,

144
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:12,780
obamacare,

145
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,591
he's a socialist.

146
00:04:13,591 --> 00:04:14,680
He started to take over the government,

147
00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:15,270
he's trying to do this,

148
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,610
he's trying to do that and
sort of blowing it out.

149
00:04:17,611 --> 00:04:17,911
Why?

150
00:04:17,911 --> 00:04:19,890
Because that creates the
tea party which you know,

151
00:04:19,891 --> 00:04:23,310
comes in and then they have power and
then the tea party by the way has to go

152
00:04:23,311 --> 00:04:24,660
back to their constituents and say,

153
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:25,501
we're going to repeal it,

154
00:04:25,501 --> 00:04:26,071
we're going to do this,

155
00:04:26,071 --> 00:04:26,904
we're going to do,

156
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:27,743
and it just becomes.

157
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:32,900
Everything goes to the atomic level
and so that when you actually go into,

158
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,833
into,

159
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,230
you know,

160
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:38,910
into Congress or into the executive
or into the Senate and you try to get

161
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:39,840
anything done,

162
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:44,550
you can't because you promised
that you're not gonna do anything.

163
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:47,090
You're not going to have
any sort of partisan.

164
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,750
A relation.

165
00:04:48,751 --> 00:04:49,380
Bipartisan,

166
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,213
bipartisan.

167
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:50,521
Yeah.

168
00:04:50,521 --> 00:04:51,510
It's fucked up man.

169
00:04:51,511 --> 00:04:51,660
It's,

170
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,960
and it's stupid and it exists
because we have two parties.

171
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,330
When you make to people we make.

172
00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:59,400
One of them were red and you
make one of them were blue.

173
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,860
They start wanting to fight each other.

174
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,140
It's a stupid theory.

175
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,720
So disagree.

176
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:04,390
You're also,

177
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,590
it doesn't matter if you're in or out,

178
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:07,450
you're always empower
because there's only two,

179
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,490
so you're always going to be this.

180
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,570
The sort of opposition.

181
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:10,841
Yeah,

182
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:14,680
and that influenced the problem is like
this is what people have to realize.

183
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,840
A lot of your opinions
are my opinions too.

184
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,550
I'm not really my opinions,

185
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,660
their opinions that I've decided are good
that I've heard from other people and

186
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:27,810
a lot of our patterns of behaviors from
accents to the way we approach culture,

187
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,770
the way we think about women,

188
00:05:29,771 --> 00:05:31,150
the way we think about religion.

189
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,980
A lot of that is learned.

190
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:33,820
Okay.

191
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,540
And we have these two deeply
ingrained patterns in this country.

192
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:41,470
We have the Democrats and the Republicans
and the Republicans are these no

193
00:05:41,471 --> 00:05:43,330
nonsense get business done.

194
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,303
You know,

195
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,970
and the Democrats are,

196
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,600
you know,

197
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,680
we always think of all these people are
all cry babies and they're all wishy

198
00:05:50,681 --> 00:05:55,660
washy and they're bleeding hearts and and
that this is like ingrained in sort of

199
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:57,220
ingrained in our system.

200
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,040
These two different

201
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,900
patterns of behavior and they're severely
problematic because you could exhibit

202
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:07,930
a lot of traits on each sides and still
be a very good person or a lot of ideas

203
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:10,070
on each side and still
be a very good person.

204
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,730
Because here's the awful thing about being
an adult in a relationship or seeking

205
00:06:14,731 --> 00:06:16,570
to be an adult in a relationship.

206
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:20,820
I have found when I was young and
I was a boy and I was dating girls.

207
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,010
It's boys and girls and she's an idiot.

208
00:06:23,011 --> 00:06:26,040
You're an idiot and you do dumb things
and everyone cheats and whatever.

209
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,970
Then you hit a certain part of your life
where she's a woman and you're a man

210
00:06:29,971 --> 00:06:34,971
and you have adult expectations and you
can't be running around being an idiot

211
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:40,890
with someone who kind of wants you to be
at the table because they are sincerely

212
00:06:40,891 --> 00:06:45,230
giving time of their adult life to this
thing that you were doing together and

213
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,470
when you come in still thinking you're
in ninth grade and she's coming in like,

214
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,870
this is part of what my
life is being with you.

215
00:06:55,670 --> 00:07:00,670
I have never been able to answer that in
a mature enough way to where I would've

216
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:07,570
been able to maintain it because like
say next weekend if I had a girlfriend,

217
00:07:08,311 --> 00:07:09,510
she might say,

218
00:07:09,511 --> 00:07:10,081
it's Friday.

219
00:07:10,081 --> 00:07:10,771
What are we doing?

220
00:07:10,771 --> 00:07:11,070
I'm like,

221
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:11,903
oh,

222
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,530
watching me write for four hours,

223
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,570
and so that's not the way to be.

224
00:07:16,571 --> 00:07:17,500
You can't do that.

225
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,320
So I can't be a good persons
other half because I'm always.

226
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:27,390
The work has always attracted me
more than coming home to someone.

227
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,600
Wow.

228
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:32,470
Like I can't stand the idea of
someone of living with a person.

229
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,400
I can do it on the bus because
it's das boat and work,

230
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:35,920
you know,

231
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,970
going down the road.

232
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,223
Um,

233
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:38,731
but I,

234
00:07:38,731 --> 00:07:43,330
I never would want to like
wake up and she's there

235
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,300
and I have no aversion.

236
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,560
Get expression.

237
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,920
They can look to your right.

238
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,093
She's there

239
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,630
every day.

240
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,720
Here we are together and
I'm just not wired that way.

241
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:58,580
Oh,

242
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,031
by the way,

243
00:07:59,031 --> 00:07:59,960
did you see that?

244
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:04,010
That little clip that was making
its way around at the inauguration,

245
00:08:04,011 --> 00:08:06,760
on the inauguration stand of
Bill Clinton checking you out,

246
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:08,721
getting caught.

247
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:13,330
That was Ivanka and Ivanka could've
been either one is so hard.

248
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,210
Oh my God.

249
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:14,810
Yeah.

250
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:15,530
God,

251
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,430
Jesus Christ.

252
00:08:16,431 --> 00:08:18,140
Those jeans look was fantastic.

253
00:08:18,141 --> 00:08:20,000
The look was pure Bill Clinton.

254
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:20,400
Oh,

255
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:20,600
well.

256
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,051
He was like,

257
00:08:21,051 --> 00:08:21,501
fuck it.

258
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,334
It's over.

259
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,560
I don't have to hold it back anymore.

260
00:08:24,561 --> 00:08:24,920
Look at it.

261
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,730
I'll look it up.

262
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:26,563
Oh,

263
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,560
good Lord.

264
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,731
He's shaking.

265
00:08:28,731 --> 00:08:30,640
He's licking his lips.

266
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,450
She turns around and looks at them.

267
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,063
Look at that.

268
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,720
Oh my goodness.

269
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:36,441
And then it looks,

270
00:08:36,441 --> 00:08:37,310
it gives her a quick look.

271
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:37,920
Yeah.

272
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,753
Well,

273
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,303
she turned.

274
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,580
Once he looks at her,

275
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:46,371
he's like,

276
00:08:46,371 --> 00:08:47,204
listen bitch,

277
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,410
you know who I am.

278
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:48,870
You know,

279
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,790
you live with a wolf,

280
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,940
you know you live in a big old gray wolf.

281
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,540
She's.

282
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,171
Hi everyone.

283
00:08:54,171 --> 00:08:55,130
I'm Ivanka trump.

284
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:55,650
Wonder,

285
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,750
I wish you had a fucking accent.

286
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,823
What's going on there?

287
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,011
Oh,

288
00:08:59,011 --> 00:09:00,060
it's her giving them massage.

289
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:00,361
Oh,

290
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:04,440
this is like a porn film that they
did a fake porn about Ivanka trump.

291
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:05,600
They that.

292
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:05,940
Look,

293
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,440
that quiz is beautiful girl.

294
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:08,940
That's the best part of
the inauguration day.

295
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:09,774
It's over.

296
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:10,381
It's over.

297
00:09:10,381 --> 00:09:11,550
I could beat me again.

298
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,410
I'm tired of it all.

299
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,070
That would be the only reason I wanted
or I would have wanted a Hillary Clinton

300
00:09:17,071 --> 00:09:18,150
when the only bright spot,

301
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,290
I guess I should say instead,

302
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,900
the only bright spot to her wedding would
have been that he would have been back

303
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:23,060
in the house.

304
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:23,670
Yeah.

305
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,361
Fascinating.

306
00:09:24,361 --> 00:09:25,350
As a first man,

307
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,910
man on a rampage,

308
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,890
he'd probably be on a rampage.

309
00:09:28,891 --> 00:09:29,970
Watches watches mouth.

310
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:30,421
Yeah.

311
00:09:30,421 --> 00:09:31,260
I love his mouth.

312
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:31,951
A bites.

313
00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:32,784
His lower lip.

314
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,520
He says like Miles Ivanka?

315
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:35,970
No,

316
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:36,390
he doesn't.

317
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:36,920
Does he look.

318
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,753
Let me see.

319
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:38,903
Oh,

320
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:39,960
oh,

321
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,793
Ivanka.

322
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,380
Oh yeah.
