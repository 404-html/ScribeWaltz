1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:01,863
Hello

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:02,973
bitches.

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,280
Do you know the story of the salt
and the Dubai assaulting to Brunei?

4
00:00:06,281 --> 00:00:08,220
Rather saw no Brunei.

5
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:09,340
Um,

6
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,960
he would bring in gals and
pay them like $50,000 a month.

7
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,050
Just come on down and they
would go for a few months,

8
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:18,070
make quarter million bucks,

9
00:00:18,071 --> 00:00:22,450
then fly home and then they'd get all
this jewelry and diamonds and shit and one

10
00:00:22,451 --> 00:00:24,250
little hook or ruin the whole Party.

11
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:25,000
Buy Shoes.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,200
They caught it with a laptop,

13
00:00:26,201 --> 00:00:27,370
just writing stories about it.

14
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,120
She wanted to write a
book about her experience.

15
00:00:31,121 --> 00:00:31,780
So this dude,

16
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:32,351
this is what he would do.

17
00:00:32,351 --> 00:00:36,130
He had a disco in his house and
one of his many houses and a,

18
00:00:36,131 --> 00:00:38,740
he would have it filled with
all these girls who are making,

19
00:00:38,741 --> 00:00:39,720
who knows how much money,

20
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,260
just tens of thousands of dollars.

21
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,620
And he would come out and he's fucking
gold underwear and just in slippers and

22
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,230
slide across the room.

23
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,780
Like he was in that scene with Tom Cruise.

24
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:50,763
What's that movie?

25
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,680
Risky business play slides in.

26
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:57,100
He'd slide in like that and as gold
underwear and just go eenie Meenie meiny

27
00:00:57,101 --> 00:00:57,431
mountain.

28
00:00:57,431 --> 00:00:58,264
Just pick one out

29
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,290
and just fuck oh shit out of them.

30
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,190
And then the next day do the same thing
and he'd do whatever he wants and that

31
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,660
chick wrote the story on it.

32
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:08,523
One of them did.

33
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:09,580
Wow.

34
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,433
Yeah,

35
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,030
and he was like,

36
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:12,863
so what

37
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:14,251
is that?

38
00:01:14,251 --> 00:01:14,970
Had I known?

39
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:15,870
That's really him.

40
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:16,640
That's him.

41
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,520
Like pack Reagan.

42
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:20,000
It Vinny meanie meiny mode.

43
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,920
That guy's totally covered in gold.

44
00:01:21,921 --> 00:01:22,540
Look at them.

45
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,660
If that guy's worth more
money than you can ever,

46
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,210
can I be one of these girls?

47
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,110
Oh my God.

48
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:30,410
Go Away for 50,000 I'm doing a Gig
in Dubai guys for a whole month.

49
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,640
You just want to be the court jester.

50
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:34,250
Go over there and crack some jokes,

51
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,151
man.

52
00:01:35,151 --> 00:01:37,310
That's fucking crazy.

53
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,720
And you think he wears a condom?

54
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,243
No.

55
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:40,971
No condom.

56
00:01:40,971 --> 00:01:41,181
Right?

57
00:01:41,181 --> 00:01:42,014
Shut up.

58
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:43,370
Why would he do that?

59
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:43,581
Yeah,

60
00:01:43,581 --> 00:01:44,220
exactly.

61
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,860
He's just shooting loads of these gals,

62
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,300
but then again,

63
00:01:47,301 --> 00:01:49,340
he's opening himself up for possible.

64
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,210
I wonder if,

65
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,700
to what I bet he gets them tested.

66
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:54,770
He puts him in catapults
and shoots him in the air.

67
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,410
I am closer to being Lance Armstrong,

68
00:01:58,411 --> 00:02:02,250
like closest on a diet to
absent all carbohydrates,

69
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,350
but I'm still,

70
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:04,681
you know,

71
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:06,360
now I'm just a bigger individual.

72
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:06,661
I mean,

73
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:07,330
it's interesting.

74
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,310
We were talking about,

75
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,203
uh,

76
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,070
uh,

77
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:11,903
you know,

78
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,200
I was talking to,

79
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:16,680
a friend of mine was at freshmen
manager of my college football team.

80
00:02:16,681 --> 00:02:17,700
So this was Harvard.

81
00:02:17,701 --> 00:02:17,971
Okay.

82
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,670
It was division two football.

83
00:02:19,671 --> 00:02:20,970
He was a lot of smart,

84
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,560
you know,

85
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,840
guys who couldn't make it in division one.

86
00:02:24,841 --> 00:02:28,260
We had kids who went to Harvard because
they didn't get scholarships at Holy

87
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:28,261
Cross.

88
00:02:28,261 --> 00:02:28,651
So they went,

89
00:02:28,651 --> 00:02:28,921
okay,

90
00:02:28,921 --> 00:02:30,300
I'll play football for Harvard.

91
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:31,134
They were local.

92
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,710
1976 my senior year,

93
00:02:34,711 --> 00:02:36,570
the biggest kid on our team,

94
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:37,830
Danny tickets,

95
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,930
weight 265 pounds,

96
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,820
six foot five from our standards.

97
00:02:42,821 --> 00:02:43,710
He was enormous.

98
00:02:43,711 --> 00:02:46,770
He went off to play for the Chicago
bears for five or six years.

99
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,640
I think we had one other offensive
lineman who was two 65 also six,

100
00:02:53,491 --> 00:02:53,731
four,

101
00:02:53,731 --> 00:02:54,031
six,

102
00:02:54,031 --> 00:02:54,864
five,

103
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:55,893
um,

104
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,010
maybe two this year.

105
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,280
Harvard football team,

106
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,181
smart kid,

107
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,250
same socioeconomic status.

108
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,570
The entire office of,

109
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:08,460
they got I think 12 players
over 300 pounds to his.

110
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,640
These guys were enormous.

111
00:03:09,641 --> 00:03:11,650
I mean there's six seven 300 pounds.

112
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,090
They didn't grow people that
big when I was growing up.

113
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,970
I mean I could say maybe I didn't see him,

114
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,800
maybe they weren't around.

115
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:24,190
Maybe they were six seven and they only
weighed two 30 cause they weren't being

116
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:27,280
bulked up so they were playing
basketball instead of football.

117
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,440
I mean I could imagine ways that that
confusing but from our perception if you

118
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:37,441
look just what happens when I was a kid
in early 1960s I remember I as far as I

119
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:44,101
know there was one 300 pounder
in the NFL and the AFL,

120
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,150
two different leads back then.

121
00:03:46,151 --> 00:03:46,984
Bob De,

122
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:47,801
I remember his name,

123
00:03:47,801 --> 00:03:52,420
he played for the Boston Patriots and
his head was like small compared to his

124
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:53,950
body and he was a big fat guy.

125
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,660
You know what is there now 2030 per team

126
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,220
and you're saying like a lot of people
are saying no the sciences out because

127
00:04:02,221 --> 00:04:03,660
their spend billions
of dollars to do that.

128
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:04,651
The thing is,

129
00:04:04,651 --> 00:04:06,870
is when you are playing such far right,

130
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,440
far left partisan politics.

131
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,150
Yeah.

132
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,440
Then you have people saying,

133
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,393
Oh,

134
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:12,181
uh,

135
00:04:12,181 --> 00:04:12,751
Obamacare,

136
00:04:12,751 --> 00:04:13,561
he's a socialist.

137
00:04:13,561 --> 00:04:14,670
He's trying to take over the government.

138
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:15,241
He's trying to do this,

139
00:04:15,241 --> 00:04:17,610
he's trying to do that and
sort of blowing it out.

140
00:04:17,611 --> 00:04:17,911
Why?

141
00:04:17,911 --> 00:04:19,320
Because that creates the tea party,

142
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:19,921
which you know,

143
00:04:19,921 --> 00:04:23,010
comes in and then they have power
and then the tea party by the way,

144
00:04:23,011 --> 00:04:24,660
has to go back to their
constituents and say,

145
00:04:24,661 --> 00:04:25,500
we're going to repeal it.

146
00:04:25,501 --> 00:04:26,041
We're going to do this,

147
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:26,874
we're going to do anything.

148
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,773
And it just becomes,

149
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,030
everything goes to the atomic level.

150
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,000
And so that when you actually go into,

151
00:04:33,001 --> 00:04:33,834
into,

152
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:34,210
you know,

153
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:39,210
into Congress or the executive or into
the Senate and you try to get anything

154
00:04:39,331 --> 00:04:40,164
done,

155
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:44,550
you can't because you've promised
that you're not going to do anything.

156
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,200
You're going to have any sort of,

157
00:04:46,201 --> 00:04:46,470
you know,

158
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,190
partisan,

159
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,010
uh,

160
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:48,241
you know,

161
00:04:48,241 --> 00:04:48,751
relation,

162
00:04:48,751 --> 00:04:49,351
bipartisan,

163
00:04:49,351 --> 00:04:49,920
bipartisan

164
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,341
relations.

165
00:04:50,341 --> 00:04:50,521
Yeah.

166
00:04:50,521 --> 00:04:51,510
It's fucked up man.

167
00:04:51,511 --> 00:04:51,661
It's,

168
00:04:51,661 --> 00:04:52,471
and it's stupid.

169
00:04:52,471 --> 00:04:54,960
And it exists because we have two parties.

170
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,330
When you make to people we make,

171
00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:59,400
one of them were red and you
make one of them were blue,

172
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,840
they start wanting to fight each other.

173
00:05:00,841 --> 00:05:01,110
It's a,

174
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,720
it's a stupid thing are also disagree.

175
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:04,330
You're also,

176
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:05,590
it doesn't matter if you're in or out,

177
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:07,450
you're always empower
cause there's only two,

178
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:07,970
right.

179
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,330
So you're always going to be,

180
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,570
this is the sort of opposition.

181
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:10,841
Yeah.

182
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:14,680
And that influenced the problem is like
this is what people have to realize.

183
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,870
A lot of your opinions
and my opinions too,

184
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,550
I'm not really my opinions,

185
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,850
their opinions that I have decided are
good that I've heard from other people.

186
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,270
Right.

187
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:27,270
And a lot of our patterns of behaviors
from accents to the way we approach

188
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:28,211
culture,

189
00:05:28,211 --> 00:05:29,770
that the way we think about women,

190
00:05:29,771 --> 00:05:31,180
the way we think about religion,

191
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,040
a lot of that is learned.

192
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:33,821
Okay.

193
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:37,540
And we have these two deeply
ingrained patterns in this country.

194
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:41,230
We have the Democrats and we have the
Republicans and the Republicans are these

195
00:05:41,231 --> 00:05:43,360
no nonsense get business done.

196
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,343
You know,

197
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:44,880
and the,

198
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,970
the Democrats are,

199
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,600
you know,

200
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,680
we always think of all these people are
all cry babies and they're all wishy

201
00:05:50,681 --> 00:05:52,690
washy and they're bleeding hearts.

202
00:05:52,691 --> 00:05:53,260
And,

203
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,060
and that this is like ingrained,

204
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,220
it's sort of ingrained in our system,

205
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,040
these two different

206
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:03,040
patterns of behavior if they're severely
problematic because you could exhibit a

207
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:08,051
lot of traits on each sides and still be
a very good person or a lot of ideas on

208
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:10,100
each side and still be a very good person.

209
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:14,730
Cause here's the awful thing about being
an adult in a relationship to seeking

210
00:06:14,731 --> 00:06:16,590
to be an adult in a relationship.

211
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,100
I have found,

212
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:18,300
uh,

213
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,820
when I was young and I was a
boy and I was dating girls,

214
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,010
it's poison girls and she's an idiot.

215
00:06:23,011 --> 00:06:24,750
You're an idiot and you do dumb things.

216
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,070
And if when cheats and whatever,

217
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,970
then you hit a certain part of your life
where she's a woman and you're a man

218
00:06:29,971 --> 00:06:34,971
and you have adult expectations and you
can't be running around being an idiot

219
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:40,890
with someone who kind of wants you to be
at the table because they are sincerely

220
00:06:40,891 --> 00:06:44,970
giving time of their adult life to this
thing that you were doing together.

221
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,110
And when you come in still thinking
you're in ninth grade and she's coming in

222
00:06:49,111 --> 00:06:53,680
like this is part of what my life is,

223
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:54,900
is being with you.

224
00:06:55,590 --> 00:07:00,590
I have never been able to answer that
in a mature enough way to where I would

225
00:07:02,451 --> 00:07:03,930
have been able to maintain it.

226
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,280
Because like say next weekend
if I had a girlfriend,

227
00:07:08,281 --> 00:07:10,080
she might say it's Friday.

228
00:07:10,081 --> 00:07:10,771
What are we doing?

229
00:07:10,771 --> 00:07:11,070
I'm like,

230
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:11,903
oh,

231
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,530
watching me write for four hours

232
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,503
worse.

233
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,570
And so that's not the way to be.

234
00:07:16,571 --> 00:07:17,500
You can't do that.

235
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:22,330
And so I can't be a good persons
other half cause I'm always,

236
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:27,390
the work has always attracted me
more than coming home to someone.

237
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,600
Wow.

238
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:28,811
Like,

239
00:07:28,811 --> 00:07:28,971
I,

240
00:07:28,971 --> 00:07:32,500
I can't stand the idea of
someone of living with a person.

241
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,410
I can do it on the bus cause
it's das boat and we're like,

242
00:07:35,411 --> 00:07:35,920
you know,

243
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,970
going down the road.

244
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,253
Um,

245
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:38,711
but I,

246
00:07:38,711 --> 00:07:43,330
I never would want to like
wake up and she's there

247
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,320
and I have no aversion.

248
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:50,523
Right.

249
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,640
She's there

250
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,630
every day.

251
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,710
Here we are together and
I'm just not wired that way.

252
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:58,580
Oh,

253
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,031
by the way,

254
00:07:59,031 --> 00:07:59,960
did you see that,

255
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,590
uh,

256
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:04,190
that little clip that was making its
way around at the inauguration on the

257
00:08:04,191 --> 00:08:08,680
inauguration stand of Bill Clinton
checking out and getting caught.

258
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:09,500
That was nice.

259
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,910
Ivanka and Ivanka,

260
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,490
his daughter so hot.

261
00:08:13,491 --> 00:08:14,150
Oh my God.

262
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:14,840
Yeah.

263
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,500
God,

264
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,430
Jesus Christ.

265
00:08:16,431 --> 00:08:18,140
Those jeans look was fantastic.

266
00:08:18,141 --> 00:08:19,970
The look was pure Bill Clinton.

267
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:20,390
He,

268
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:20,571
well,

269
00:08:20,571 --> 00:08:21,051
he was like,

270
00:08:21,051 --> 00:08:21,501
fuck it.

271
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,334
It's over.

272
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,560
I don't have to hold it back anymore.

273
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:24,891
Look at it.

274
00:08:24,891 --> 00:08:25,724
I'll let me look it up.

275
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,583
Oh,

276
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,560
good Lord.

277
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,700
He's shaking.

278
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,410
He's licking his light.

279
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,450
When she turns around and looks at them,

280
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,063
look at that.

281
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,720
Oh my goodness.

282
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,441
And then he looks,

283
00:08:36,441 --> 00:08:37,310
it gives her a quick look.

284
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:38,323
Yeah.

285
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,590
Once he looks at her,

286
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:46,401
he's like,

287
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:46,761
listen,

288
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:47,240
bitch,

289
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,410
you know who I am.

290
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,790
You know you live with a wolf.

291
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,630
They'll get dad out.

292
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,970
You know you live in a big old gray wolf.

293
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,510
She's,

294
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,171
hi everyone.

295
00:08:54,171 --> 00:08:55,130
I'm Ivanka Trump.

296
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,640
Want to remind?

297
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,750
I wish you had a fucking accent.

298
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,823
What's going on there?

299
00:08:58,890 --> 00:08:59,011
Oh,

300
00:08:59,011 --> 00:09:00,060
it's her giving him a massage.

301
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:00,361
Oh,

302
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:04,440
this is like a porn film that they
did a fake porn about Ivanka Trump.

303
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,290
Look beautiful.

304
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,940
It's the best part of
the inauguration day.

305
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:09,774
It's over.

306
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:10,381
It's over.

307
00:09:10,381 --> 00:09:11,550
I can beat me again.

308
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,410
I'm tired of it all.

309
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,760
That would be the only reason I wanted,

310
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,090
or I would have wanted a Hillary
Clinton when the only bright spot,

311
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,350
I guess I should say instead,

312
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,900
the only bright spot to her wedding would
have been that he would have been back

313
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:23,040
in and the house.

314
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:23,670
Yeah.

315
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,361
Fascinating.

316
00:09:24,361 --> 00:09:26,910
As a first mom man on a rampage,

317
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,860
he'd probably be on a rampage.

318
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:29,340
Watches.

319
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,173
Watch his mouth.

320
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:30,481
Yeah.

321
00:09:30,481 --> 00:09:31,950
I love little bites.

322
00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:32,784
His lower lip.

323
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,490
He says like miles Ivanka.

324
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:35,980
No,

325
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:36,650
he doesn't.

326
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:37,483
What can we say this?

327
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,293
Oh,

328
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,231
oh,

329
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:41,250
Ivanka.

330
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,370
Oh yeah,

331
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:51,850
yeah.
