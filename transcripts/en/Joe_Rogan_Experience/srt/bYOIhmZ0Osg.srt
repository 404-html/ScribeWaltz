1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,130
Move over a little bit.
I seem right.

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:05,270
Three,
two,

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,050
one.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:09,610
Yes.
Alright,

5
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,050
welcome back Chris.
What's up man?

6
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:11,650
How's.
Thanks.

7
00:00:11,651 --> 00:00:12,970
Happy to be here.
Things are good.

8
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:14,290
How many have you?
Yeah.

9
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,950
What's the latest and the greatest view?
A new book came out yesterday.

10
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:21,970
That's always a big one.
What's called a unconventional medicine.

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,670
And uh,
give us the,

12
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,260
what is it,
what are those sheets?

13
00:00:26,261 --> 00:00:28,600
The back sheet called to the.
Yeah,

14
00:00:28,601 --> 00:00:30,650
the backseat not works.
Um,

15
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,900
the biggest challenge we face today is 
chronic disease and conventional 

16
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,220
medicine has failed to address it.
So we need a new system.

17
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,620
That's the nutshell.
And you're essentially,

18
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,510
I'm doing nutrition based,
uh,

19
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,360
for the three components,
ancestral diet and lifestyle,

20
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:54,510
which we've talked about,
a functional medicine and a 

21
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,930
collaborative practice model that 
incorporates health coaches,

22
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:58,620
nutritionists,
and other allied providers to,

23
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:03,740
to offer more support to patients.
What does that mean when you say 

24
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,070
functional medicine?
So the easiest way to understand it,

25
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:11,140
it is,
it's an approach that is geared towards 

26
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,981
addressing the underlying cause of a 
problem instead of just suppressing the 

27
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:13,981
symptoms.

28
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:17,230
So you go into the doctor,
you've got a high cholesterol,

29
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,420
usually given a drug to lower it 
statens.

30
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:24,450
Yup.
You got high blood pressure and those 

31
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:24,450
are devastating your health,
right?

32
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:24,580
Statens or.
Well,

33
00:01:24,581 --> 00:01:27,490
you know,
for some people they can be.

34
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:32,550
I wouldn't say they're devastating for 
everybody and they do save lives in 

35
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,361
certain situations.
But the idea that they're the first 

36
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:36,361
thing we,
we would do in that situation.

37
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:41,341
That's what's off that.
You wouldn't suggest like altering the 

38
00:01:41,341 --> 00:01:41,830
diet.
Exactly.

39
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:44,530
Let's look at why the cholesterol is 
high in the first place.

40
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,260
Same thing with high blood pressure.
You go into the doctor,

41
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,720
high blood pressure,
you get a drug to lower it,

42
00:01:49,721 --> 00:01:52,900
there's rarely any investigation and 
your blood pressure is high.

43
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,850
And what are the main factors that high 
cholesterol?

44
00:01:54,851 --> 00:01:58,540
Because I know that um,
it's a big part of it is hereditary.

45
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,200
Yeah,
right.

46
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,090
Genetics play a huge role.
Yeah.

47
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,060
So the genetics is one for sure.
Uh,

48
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:09,090
but then you have things like poor 
thyroid function can actually lead to 

49
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,091
high cholesterol or Ldl particle number.
You've got infections can do that.

50
00:02:12,401 --> 00:02:17,401
Like h Pylori,
which is the bacteria that causes ulcer 

51
00:02:17,401 --> 00:02:17,500
a,
you've got leaky gut.

52
00:02:17,501 --> 00:02:19,660
Intestinal permeability has been shown 
to do that.

53
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,960
That's interesting that you did you talk
about this before,

54
00:02:22,961 --> 00:02:24,150
but a lot of people are not aware of 
that,

55
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:27,190
that there's actually gut bacteria that 
causes ulcers.

56
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:28,300
Yeah.
Yeah.

57
00:02:28,301 --> 00:02:29,370
There's a.
it's a.

58
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,080
it's a cool story actually,
so you know,

59
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,680
20,
30 years ago that the dominant idea was 

60
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,260
ulcers were caused by stress and things 
like eating spicy foods and a couple of 

61
00:02:40,631 --> 00:02:43,510
Australian physicians presented at a 
conference.

62
00:02:43,511 --> 00:02:44,740
This notion that,
no,

63
00:02:44,741 --> 00:02:48,250
actually they're caused by this bacteria
called helicobacter pylori,

64
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,620
and they were literally laughed off the 
stage.

65
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:55,430
Nobody took them seriously.
They were ridiculed and they kept going.

66
00:02:55,431 --> 00:03:00,431
I kept doing this research,
kept trying to present this idea and 

67
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:00,520
nobody take them seriously.
Finally,

68
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:05,530
one of them swallowed a vial of,
have a solution that had the bacterium 

69
00:03:05,921 --> 00:03:06,490
in,
in,

70
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,030
in it,
developed an ulcer as a result,

71
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:15,060
and then treated himself with 
antibiotics and got rid of the ulcer to 

72
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,480
approve this is how committed this guy 
was,

73
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:19,930
this idea and proving this.
And finally at that point people started

74
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:24,931
to pay attention,
but it's still was another 10 years 

75
00:03:24,931 --> 00:03:27,871
before that theory was widely accepted 
and then they eventually won the Nobel 

76
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,510
prize in medicine as a result of that 
discovery.

77
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:32,470
So that,
to me,

78
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:36,490
that's a great example of how group 
think is such a problem in medicine.

79
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:41,520
You know,
we have a tendency to just like get 

80
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,250
stuck on the status quo,
even though a core principle of sciences

81
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,500
uncertainty,
you know,

82
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:45,820
like we don't,
we,

83
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,140
we come up with a hypothesis.

84
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,800
We have to be willing to challenge our 
most cherished views all the time.

85
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:56,260
Um,
because if we look at the history of 

86
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,021
science,
it was the history of most people being 

87
00:03:58,021 --> 00:03:58,021
wrong about most things most of the 
time.

88
00:03:58,021 --> 00:04:02,640
Yeah.
And it's amazing how many people are 

89
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,071
still operating under information that 
has been updated many times over the 

90
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:11,190
past couple of decades.
But absolutely talk to the average 

91
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,481
person about what you should eat.
I mean they're looking at like the food 

92
00:04:12,481 --> 00:04:13,780
pyramid from the Dr Seuss books.
Really?

93
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:19,050
Yeah.
Or another one is you probably saw some 

94
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:19,240
articles like stents have.
They don't work.

95
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,460
Yeah.
I just read that just came out with they

96
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,920
don't work,
but there's still a massively being used

97
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,960
in part because they get a doctors get 
paid for that now.

98
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,730
That's crazy because I thought a stent 
was like,

99
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,140
I thought it propped open the artery.
I mean what does it do?

100
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,230
Right.
And,

101
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:41,280
but the question is,
does that actually have the desired 

102
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,940
effect?
I mean the thing was based on pain 

103
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:43,940
resident,
wasn't it?

104
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,510
And mammograms prevent,
we're supposed to prevent breast cancer.

105
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,160
They don't.
Then we saw the huge randomized 

106
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,520
controlled trial that showed that not 
only did they not prevent breast cancer,

107
00:04:54,521 --> 00:04:59,521
they may actually increase death either 
as a result of unnecessary treatments 

108
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:02,930
that come from the mammogram.
So yeah.

109
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,310
How,
how would you get an unnecessary trip?

110
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,090
Like if you did a mammogram and you saw 
a lump,

111
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,120
well it's not always black or white,
so it could be a cyst or something 

112
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,080
unless somebody gets unnecessary 
treatment and that lends that leads to 

113
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,870
an adverse event.
So I'm just saying it's,

114
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,900
you know,
we got to be humble and realize that we 

115
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,391
don't always have the answers and that 
in 10 years it's going to look really 

116
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:24,391
different than it does now.

117
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:29,370
Just like a hundred years ago,
everybody thought they had the answers 

118
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,791
and you know,
we look back on them and we say how 

119
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:32,791
silly,
you know,

120
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:36,360
but we forget that people are 100 years 
ahead are going to look back on us with 

121
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:36,360
that same.
You know,

122
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,520
that they're going to shake their heads.
Yeah.

123
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:44,521
It's very unfortunate.
But that is a tendency that people have 

124
00:05:44,521 --> 00:05:46,090
when they've been living their life 
based on what they think is like certain

125
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:48,220
rigid information.
Like this is absolute,

126
00:05:48,221 --> 00:05:50,200
this is true.
And they've been teaching that.

127
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:53,470
That's when it gets especially 
problematic or writing books about that.

128
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,680
Yeah.
And then they just never want to admit 

129
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:58,680
that their book is bullshit and I think 
the,

130
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,060
our education system needs to change 
medical education because you know,

131
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:05,690
you write a textbook and that takes a 
long time and then,

132
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,430
you know,
the textbook is used in,

133
00:06:07,431 --> 00:06:08,380
in,
in chorus,

134
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:13,390
like the medical schools are still using
the nutrition textbooks that were 

135
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,750
probably written in the seventies,
the eighties or something.

136
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:20,170
And then we get all these new studies 
showing that like cholesterol in the 

137
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:23,981
Diet makes,
has no impact on your blood cholesterol 

138
00:06:23,981 --> 00:06:23,981
for most people.

139
00:06:23,981 --> 00:06:28,530
Say that again,
because for a lot of people who live 

140
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:28,530
like,
what did he just say?

141
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:28,570
Yeah.
So,

142
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:33,790
uh,
even the American standard us diet 

143
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,800
guidelines last year,
a lot of people might've missed this.

144
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:40,060
They completely removed any restriction 
on dietary cholesterol from the,

145
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:44,890
from the US diet guidelines.
They basically said there's no reason to

146
00:06:44,891 --> 00:06:46,900
limit cholesterol in your diet anymore.

147
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:52,560
Now for people who don't know why this 
is so crazy or how this came to be,

148
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:58,110
you need to go to the New York Times 
article on how the sugar industry bribe 

149
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:03,130
scientists and convinced scientists to 
publish faulty or false information 

150
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:09,540
pointing toward saturated fats and 
cholesterol as being the cause of heart 

151
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:13,861
disease and heart attacks and all these 
different elements so that they could 

152
00:07:13,861 --> 00:07:17,850
push the blame away from sugar and I 
think they only got paid something like 

153
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:18,190
$50,000
to do it.

154
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,280
Yeah.
Well,

155
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:22,450
she's amazing when you think about how 
many people that's affected.

156
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,830
Yeah.
And these,

157
00:07:23,831 --> 00:07:28,831
I mean,
these conflicts of interest are 

158
00:07:28,831 --> 00:07:28,831
everywhere.
It's a big topic of interest.

159
00:07:28,831 --> 00:07:28,831
I mean,
that's just,

160
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:30,640
that's just crime,
right?

161
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:33,610
But it's horrible things to people.
It totally,

162
00:07:33,611 --> 00:07:38,611
you know,
it's unfortunately pretty normal in 

163
00:07:38,611 --> 00:07:41,101
medicine.
There was a study that just came out a 

164
00:07:41,101 --> 00:07:43,920
few days ago that showed that the more 
gifts doctors receive from 

165
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,981
pharmaceutical companies,
the more expensive the drugs they 

166
00:07:46,981 --> 00:07:49,570
prescribe and the more prescriptions 
they write in general.

167
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,490
Yeah,
I would imagine that's true.

168
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:56,540
Um,
my wife's mom was a nurse and she would 

169
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,911
tell me stories about how they would 
take them out to nice dinners at fancy 

170
00:07:59,911 --> 00:08:01,060
restaurants and everything on the house.
And it's human nature.

171
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:01,860
I mean,
you know,

172
00:08:01,861 --> 00:08:04,780
up to one of my favorite quotes is from 
Upton Sinclair.

173
00:08:04,781 --> 00:08:09,781
He said it's difficult to get a man to 
understand something when his salary is 

174
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:10,310
dependent on him not understanding it.

175
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,860
That's a great quote.
Yeah.

176
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:17,830
So one more time,
dietary cholesterol has no impact.

177
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:18,880
Yeah.
Well,

178
00:08:18,881 --> 00:08:23,881
I'll be more specific.
So in 70 percent of people eating egg 

179
00:08:25,031 --> 00:08:29,620
yolks and cholesterol and meat and other
things doesn't do anything to your serum

180
00:08:29,621 --> 00:08:31,600
cholesterol.
The cholesterol levels in your blood,

181
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:37,170
in 30 percent of people,
you'll get a slight raise in your ldl 

182
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:38,170
cholesterol,
the so called bad cholesterol,

183
00:08:38,171 --> 00:08:40,930
but you also get a raise in your hdl 
cholesterol,

184
00:08:40,931 --> 00:08:45,931
which is a so called good cholesterol,
which means there's no net clinical 

185
00:08:45,931 --> 00:08:48,970
impact of that in terms of your risk of 
heart disease.

186
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:54,330
And this is why the US finally the last 
industrialized country to actually do 

187
00:08:56,011 --> 00:08:57,090
this.
They finally said,

188
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:02,810
okay,
well we really just can't do this 

189
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:05,181
anymore.
We can't tell you not to eat dietary 

190
00:09:05,181 --> 00:09:05,340
cholesterol because there's just not any
evidence to support that.

191
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,420
What took so long?

192
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:12,380
Well,
I think you just referred to one of the 

193
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:12,380
reasons,
you know,

194
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,830
conflicts of interest,
people that were invested in maintaining

195
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:18,831
the status quo.
I think also there's probably some 

196
00:09:18,831 --> 00:09:21,660
concern about losing credibility,
you know,

197
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,580
these organs,
these government organizations,

198
00:09:23,581 --> 00:09:28,581
if they told you,
told us not to eat cholesterol for so 

199
00:09:28,581 --> 00:09:31,131
long and then they tell us that we can 
and it's not a problem and they do that 

200
00:09:31,131 --> 00:09:31,131
with saturated fat.
You know,

201
00:09:31,131 --> 00:09:33,150
people stop listening because they just 
throw up their hands.

202
00:09:33,151 --> 00:09:38,151
They're like,
I don't know who to believe or what to 

203
00:09:38,151 --> 00:09:38,151
listen to.
That saturated fat is another one.

204
00:09:38,151 --> 00:09:41,771
You talked to the average person.
They think you should restrict your 

205
00:09:41,771 --> 00:09:41,771
intake of saturated fat.
Yeah,

206
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,980
average person.
Most doctors still.

207
00:09:43,981 --> 00:09:44,980
And,
um,

208
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,750
you know,
I,

209
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,880
I think,
I think there is some nuance here and,

210
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:54,010
and you know,
maybe we talked about this on the last 

211
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,721
show,
but where we're headed in my opinion 

212
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,810
with diet and nutrition recommendations 
is from general blanket recommendations 

213
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:03,570
that apply to everybody to more 
personalized recommendations that depend

214
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:05,850
on your genetics,
your goals,

215
00:10:05,851 --> 00:10:07,400
your lifestyle,
you know,

216
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,600
uh,
your health status,

217
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:10,980
your age,
etc.

218
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:15,390
So let's take somebody who is apo e 
four,

219
00:10:15,391 --> 00:10:16,550
four,
which is a,

220
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:21,700
you know,
have a certain genetic haplotype and 

221
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,650
they have a,
you know,

222
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:23,620
they're,
they're,

223
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:29,280
they are really sensitive to the dietary
effects of saturated fat if you have 

224
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,220
that gene type and if they eat the 
common,

225
00:10:31,221 --> 00:10:34,740
is that not very common at all?
Um,

226
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,600
I,
I can't remember the exact percent.

227
00:10:36,601 --> 00:10:38,790
It'S below 10 percent.
I think it's three point three,

228
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:43,791
four percent or something like that.
And if those people eat a lot of 

229
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,360
saturated fat,
their ldl particle number,

230
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:50,390
which we can define if you want to,
those are the particles that carry 

231
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,920
cholesterol can go up pretty pretty 
quickly.

232
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:57,980
And what we know,
at least from the research that we have 

233
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,431
is that people who have a much higher 
ldl particle number can be at higher 

234
00:11:01,431 --> 00:11:03,360
risk for heart disease and alzheimer's.

235
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:08,650
Um,
there's some murkiness there because 

236
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:08,650
that's just on average,
you know,

237
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:13,341
we don't know if that,
that risk applies to people who are 

238
00:11:13,341 --> 00:11:13,341
eating,
you know,

239
00:11:13,341 --> 00:11:16,801
paleo type of diet,
doing crossfit at taking care of 

240
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:17,030
themselves in every other way.
We just know that,

241
00:11:17,031 --> 00:11:20,280
that the general population in the 
general population,

242
00:11:20,281 --> 00:11:24,420
a higher ldl p leads to a higher risk of
these conditions.

243
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,140
Now,
I know pete,

244
00:11:25,141 --> 00:11:27,030
I'm sorry to interrupt you,
but I know people,

245
00:11:27,031 --> 00:11:28,740
um,
some people know this,

246
00:11:28,741 --> 00:11:33,741
but some people don't.
What is the difference between ldl and 

247
00:11:33,741 --> 00:11:34,160
hdl and wise one good and one bad?
Well,

248
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:37,550
he asked,
here's,

249
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:42,580
yeah,
here's an example of how things are 

250
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:42,580
changing again.
Um,

251
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,670
so historically the idea has been that 
ldl,

252
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:49,671
which stands for low density lipoprotein
and hdl stands for high density 

253
00:11:49,671 --> 00:11:54,070
lipoprotein the ldl.
The idea was it was bad,

254
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:59,310
um,
has a number of effects that contribute 

255
00:11:59,310 --> 00:11:59,310
to the risk of heart disease.

256
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:03,030
Whereas hdl does a kind of like clean up
and repair process and actually reduces 

257
00:12:04,151 --> 00:12:07,780
the risk of heart disease,
but just a couple of weeks ago there was

258
00:12:07,781 --> 00:12:12,781
some pretty influential research 
published suggesting that hdl may not be

259
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:19,530
actually so protective and it may be 
more of like a like a bystander effect 

260
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:24,121
where people that have lower risks of 
heart disease just just also have higher

261
00:12:24,641 --> 00:12:28,330
hdl and it's not that the hdl is 
protecting them.

262
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:33,331
It's whatever other underlying processes
are protecting them happened to lead to 

263
00:12:33,331 --> 00:12:36,540
higher hdl levels and the reason that 
they think this now is that they.

264
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,470
They've done a whole bunch of trials on 
drugs that raise hdl and guess what?

265
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:46,590
Nothing happens.
They don't need the people who have an 

266
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:49,921
increase in their hdl because of the 
drugs don't have a lower risk of heart 

267
00:12:50,201 --> 00:12:55,201
disease.
And in some cases they've even had to 

268
00:12:55,201 --> 00:12:57,331
stop the trials because it became clear 
that there was not only no benefit but 

269
00:12:57,331 --> 00:12:57,910
maybe even some harm.

270
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:03,450
So what kind of harm would there be?
Just more know more cardiovascular 

271
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:07,921
events or more deaths.
So it's just another example of 

272
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:10,780
something that we just assume for so 
long it's true.

273
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:15,840
And then we find out that it's not true.
I had a conversation with a guy who's a 

274
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,850
brilliant guy and we were talking about 
eggs and uh,

275
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,000
uh,
I said,

276
00:13:19,001 --> 00:13:24,001
I,
I like to eat about four to six eggs a 

277
00:13:24,001 --> 00:13:24,001
day.
It was like,

278
00:13:24,001 --> 00:13:24,001
wow,
what about all the cholesterol?

279
00:13:24,001 --> 00:13:24,370
Yeah.
And I'm like,

280
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:25,450
wow,
you don't know.

281
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:28,060
And like you don't know that and you're 
a really smart guy.

282
00:13:28,061 --> 00:13:29,650
Like this is kind of stunning.
Yeah.

283
00:13:29,651 --> 00:13:31,150
I mean it's.
And it's gonna take.

284
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,460
So,
so what I just told you about hdl,

285
00:13:33,461 --> 00:13:36,760
think of everything that has to change 
to reflect that new understanding.

286
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,950
You've got textbooks that need to be 
rewritten.

287
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:41,410
You've got primary care guidelines 
you've got,

288
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,880
it's just massive.

289
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,740
It's almost impossible to get our head 
around.

290
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:48,430
And so the average primary care 
provider's not going to get this message

291
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,670
for decades,
I would say decades,

292
00:13:51,671 --> 00:13:53,350
not more than years.
That's crazy.

293
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,440
Yeah.
So they're going to be giving out bad 

294
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,971
advice to people.
So the average person who works all day 

295
00:13:59,971 --> 00:14:02,110
and doesn't have the time to do the 
research that you do or you know,

296
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:07,410
maybe isn't informed about all the 
various blogs and books and just doesn't

297
00:14:07,811 --> 00:14:12,811
have time,
goes to his primary care doctor and ask 

298
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:15,071
him questions and he gets terrible 
information because then unfortunately 

299
00:14:15,071 --> 00:14:16,270
the primary care doctor doesn't have the
time either.

300
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:16,960
You know,
they're,

301
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,490
they're,
they're in a bad spot.

302
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:20,590
You know,
I know a lot of primary care physicians,

303
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:25,591
they're all,
everyone I know went into medicine for 

304
00:14:25,591 --> 00:14:25,591
the right reason.
They're trying to help people.

305
00:14:25,591 --> 00:14:28,480
They're doing their best,
but they're seeing 2,500

306
00:14:28,481 --> 00:14:29,110
patients.

307
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,030
That's how many they have on their 
roster.

308
00:14:31,031 --> 00:14:36,031
Their average visit is eight,
is between eight and 12 minutes because 

309
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:39,250
they get reimbursed based on the number 
of visits.

310
00:14:39,251 --> 00:14:40,630
So they,
in order to make a living,

311
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:42,820
they have to see a certain number of 
patients a day.

312
00:14:42,821 --> 00:14:44,860
And the insurance companies often 
mandate that.

313
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,470
Um,
so in a 10 minute visit,

314
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:50,080
patient shows up with multiple chronic 
conditions,

315
00:14:50,081 --> 00:14:52,450
taking multiple medications,
uh,

316
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:56,090
and then presenting with new symptoms 
that they're concerned about.

317
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:59,270
There's barely enough time to say hello 
and you know,

318
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:04,750
figure out what's going on with their 
meds and make an adjustment and make a 

319
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,960
new prescription much less to talk to 
them in any kind of meaningful way about

320
00:15:05,961 --> 00:15:08,090
their diet and their lifestyle and their
behavior.

321
00:15:08,091 --> 00:15:09,830
Forget it.
It's impossible.

322
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:15,280
So the,
the primary care doctors I think are as 

323
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:15,280
much victims of the,
of,

324
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:20,020
of our conventional system and the way 
it's set up as patients are and if 

325
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:24,260
they're busting their butts,
seeing patients eight hours a day every 

326
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:28,311
day,
and then they have all the paperwork to 

327
00:15:28,311 --> 00:15:30,491
do on top of that last thing they're 
going to want to do is go home and fire 

328
00:15:30,491 --> 00:15:31,880
up pub pub mat and start reading,
you know,

329
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:35,420
the latest studies that have come out 
for sure they're going to be exhausted.

330
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,620
Non-motivated.
Yeah.

331
00:15:36,621 --> 00:15:37,820
And they got families,
you know,

332
00:15:37,821 --> 00:15:39,290
they have other things to do.
And,

333
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:39,900
and,
and,

334
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:44,970
and there are studies that have shown 
that the majority of of primary care 

335
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:47,120
physicians,
understandably given this situation,

336
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:51,380
receive most of their education from 
pharmaceutical sales reps.

337
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:54,190
You know,
who bring in the brochures and to,

338
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,290
you know,
talk about a particular condition and of

339
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:02,291
course those are,
that's not going to be unbiased 

340
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:05,231
information.
That's hilarious that they get their 

341
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:05,231
information from that.
Wow.

342
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:07,010
Yeah.
Because the reps come to the office,

343
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:12,060
you know,
and so and they have the brochures to 

344
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:12,500
the drugs and the in the brochures.
Talk about the condition and you know,

345
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,560
they have cartoons and pictures in there
and showing you the bad stuff that's 

346
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,320
happening to your arteries.
It's crazy.

347
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:21,120
It's a crazy system and it's really,
it's,

348
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,050
we're in big trouble.
I mean that's the message in my book.

349
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,580
It's like,
you know,

350
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,980
this is not just about individual 
health,

351
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:31,250
which is my first book was about taking 
back your own health.

352
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,560
This book is about taking back 
healthcare because we're,

353
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:39,690
we're screwed.
if you look at the numbers and by the 

354
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:39,690
year 20,
40,

355
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:44,410
it's estimated at 100 percent of the 
federal federal budget will go towards 

356
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:47,090
medicare and medicaid expenses leading 
nothing for anything else.

357
00:16:47,091 --> 00:16:51,470
Military and just want someone with 20,
40 watts talking about our lifetimes.

358
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,120
That's real.
That's real.

359
00:16:53,121 --> 00:16:58,121
That's if,
if healthcare spending continues to 

360
00:16:58,121 --> 00:16:58,610
increase at its current pace,
that's insane.

361
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,410
You're right.
That does not.

362
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:06,610
This is why the department of defense's 
has named healthcare as an existential 

363
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:08,660
threat to this country,
just like,

364
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:13,690
you know,
nuclear war or any other military 

365
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:16,721
threat.
They've named chronic disease as an 

366
00:17:16,721 --> 00:17:17,810
existential threat that could actually,
uh,

367
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,170
you know,
threaten our survival as a nation.

368
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:25,970
Wow.
Whoever thought of it that way,

369
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:31,220
who could have ever imagined that 
literally all of our budget would go to 

370
00:17:31,281 --> 00:17:33,890
take care of people's health by 20,
40.

371
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:37,350
That's not long.
It's not long in.

372
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:40,170
Let me,
let me give you a few examples just to,

373
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,840
you know,
to make this more clear.

374
00:17:41,841 --> 00:17:46,841
So the cost of treating a patient with 
type two diabetes is estimated to be 

375
00:17:46,841 --> 00:17:47,540
$14,000
a year.

376
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:52,810
Okay.
So we know now that a hundred million 

377
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:57,500
americans,
that's like a third of the population 

378
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:57,540
have either prediabetes or type two 
diabetes.

379
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,130
Yeah.
Wait a minute.

380
00:17:59,131 --> 00:18:04,131
cdc just published these numbers.
100 million americans have prediabetes 

381
00:18:05,911 --> 00:18:08,430
or type two diabetes,
one third,

382
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:11,450
one third.
And that is the.

383
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:16,460
I'm having a hard time.
If you had just asked me like what 

384
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:21,171
percentage of americans have diabetes?
I probably said like four percent 

385
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,380
percent who actually have type two 
diabetes is lower it,

386
00:18:25,381 --> 00:18:28,430
but I said prediabetes or type two 
diabetes.

387
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,370
Yeah,
so,

388
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:35,140
so here are a couple other sets.
A 88 percent of people who have 

389
00:18:35,431 --> 00:18:40,431
prediabetes don't know that they have it
at 87 percent and the average amount of 

390
00:18:40,951 --> 00:18:45,951
time it takes for someone to progress 
from prediabetes to full fledged type 

391
00:18:45,951 --> 00:18:49,290
two diabetes is just five years.
Wow.

392
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,900
So let's go back to that number.
$14,000

393
00:18:51,901 --> 00:18:54,690
a year to treat a single patient with 
type two diabetes.

394
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,450
Imagine someone gets diagnosed at age 
40,

395
00:18:57,451 --> 00:19:01,360
which is totally possible.
I mean now even eight year old kids,

396
00:19:01,361 --> 00:19:06,361
they're being diagnosed with type two 
diabetes and imagine that person lives 

397
00:19:06,361 --> 00:19:10,281
at an another 45 years,
which is also feasible because we have 

398
00:19:10,281 --> 00:19:14,211
these.
One of the amazing things about 

399
00:19:14,211 --> 00:19:14,760
conventional medicine into the 
technologies that keep us alive probably

400
00:19:14,761 --> 00:19:19,761
a lot longer than we should be.
So let's say that person lives 45 years.

401
00:19:20,131 --> 00:19:22,290
We spent $13,000
a year,

402
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,320
a $14,000
a year treating that person,

403
00:19:25,321 --> 00:19:30,321
that's $630,000
to treat one patient with one disease 

404
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:32,910
over that patient,
you know,

405
00:19:32,911 --> 00:19:34,350
remaining lifetime.

406
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:39,350
Now if you start doing some math and you
assume how,

407
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:44,660
you know,
even 50 million people with diabetes 

408
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,930
times $630,000,
you get a number with so many zeroes 

409
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,110
after it.
I don't even know what it is.

410
00:19:49,111 --> 00:19:52,020
It's like a google or a google plex or 
something.

411
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:57,890
So this is why we're,
we're facing this threat and this is why

412
00:19:58,261 --> 00:20:01,350
I wrote the book.
It's like people aren't aware that we're

413
00:20:01,351 --> 00:20:02,720
at this point where,
you know,

414
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:05,220
like one in two americans now as a 
chronic disease,

415
00:20:05,221 --> 00:20:10,221
one in four have multiple,
one in two americans has a chronic 

416
00:20:10,221 --> 00:20:13,791
disease,
one into one in four have multiple 

417
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:14,790
chronic diseases.
And I know you're a parent so,

418
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:19,850
and I am 2:30
percent almost of kids now have a 

419
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:22,170
chronic disease and that's up from just 
13 percent in 1994.

420
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:27,770
So there's been more than a doubling of 
kids with chronic disease and less than 

421
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:27,770
25 years.

422
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,610
How has that,
what has changed in the american diet?

423
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:34,820
YoU attributing it to the american 
american and affects all of the above.

424
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,600
So I wouldn't say it's the diet,
It's an increase in sedentary activity,

425
00:20:39,601 --> 00:20:43,320
you know,
lIke a sitting for very long periods,

426
00:20:43,321 --> 00:20:47,910
not moving around,
not enough exposure to artificial or non

427
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,080
exposure to bright,
to,

428
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:52,540
to natural light.
Too much exposure to artificial light,

429
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,760
not enough sleep,
you know?

430
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:59,970
So all of these things come together and
now we've got a nation of people with 

431
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:04,381
chronic disease and chronic disease is 
bankrupting our country and it's 

432
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:11,100
extremely difficult to treat.
It lasts for a lifetime and our only 

433
00:21:11,831 --> 00:21:15,280
hope actually of dealing with this 
problem and surviving as a,

434
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,080
as a country,
as a nation,

435
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:22,680
is to figure out a way to prevent and 
reverse disease instead of just 

436
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,070
suppressing symptoms and putting 
bandaids on it,

437
00:21:24,071 --> 00:21:27,970
which is what our current conventional 
medical system does.

438
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:31,630
Do you really scared me with that 
diabetes number,

439
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:35,080
that debts really freaking out.
I can't believe that.

440
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,840
Well,
what do you pull them up,

441
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:41,850
jane?
More than 100 million americans have 

442
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:41,850
diabetes or its precursor.
Staggering.

443
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:44,500
Cdc report reveals,
and this is just from july.

444
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:45,940
Yeah.
Wow.

445
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,020
In 2015,
least one point 5 million new cases were

446
00:21:50,021 --> 00:21:55,021
diagnosed and people over 18.
Now a third of the us population is 

447
00:21:55,021 --> 00:21:55,300
diabetes.
Diabetes.

448
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,480
Let me throw a couple others that you,
uh,

449
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:00,400
the cdc just updated it to obesity 
statistics.

450
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:03,370
Now,
40 percent of us adults are obese.

451
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:06,360
Oh my god.
Forty percent for intent,

452
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:10,060
not just overweight,
obese and 30 percent,

453
00:22:10,061 --> 00:22:14,740
40 percent and almost 20 percent of 
adolescents are now obese.

454
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,390
Now,
how are they based in this?

455
00:22:16,391 --> 00:22:19,720
By those body standards,
body mass index,

456
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,370
obesity,
that it's not.

457
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:23,230
That doesn't work.
It's not perfect,

458
00:22:23,231 --> 00:22:26,560
but it's not so,
so imperfect that it's,

459
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:31,590
you know,
we're talking about a 20 percent 

460
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:31,590
difference.

461
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:31,590
Look at body mass Index,
five foot eight,

462
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,490
200 pounds.
I think I'm like dying.

463
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,440
I think like,
yeah,

464
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,180
like if you look at the body mass index,
I think I'm like,

465
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:44,270
have to have terrible health,
but all you have to do is go to an 

466
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:44,270
airport.
You know,

467
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:44,910
I just flew down here,
you know,

468
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:49,330
you sit in an airport and you look 
around yo the sticks or crowds,

469
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,280
but there's also a lot of people that 
lift weights,

470
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,900
like there's a lot of people that are 
bigger.

471
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,950
I would like to know what the,
you know,

472
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,700
what am I obese.
Yeah,

473
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:58,180
I'm obese.
Come on.

474
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,040
Damn that.
Come on site.

475
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:06,540
I mean look,
but you don't have diabetes and you're 

476
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:06,870
not 10 percent body fat or.
Yeah,

477
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:09,250
so that's just not real.
That's not real.

478
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,750
It's not that.
Well,

479
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,090
I don't know.
I think that statistic.

480
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:18,210
I mean,
what do you think out of 10 people that 

481
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:18,210
you see on the street are for obese?

482
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:20,440
Well,
if I'm obese now I know that I'm obese,

483
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:25,540
right?
According to that will give you gotta 

484
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:25,540
throw that thing out the window.
That's not a good metric.

485
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:29,850
It's not a perfect metric,
but they have done studies where they 

486
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:32,200
have accounted for that and they do.
You do see some variation,

487
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:34,000
but you're.
You're not the norm.

488
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,920
You're not,
you're not,

489
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,830
you're an outlier.
I'm aware of that,

490
00:23:38,831 --> 00:23:42,030
but I think there's probably got to be 
quite a few outliers out there.

491
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:45,000
There are quite a few but not enough on 
ever,

492
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:48,560
but not enough to change that statistic 
in a really meaningful way.

493
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,790
It's not going to,
you know,

494
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:51,710
there aren't 20 percent of you,
you know,

495
00:23:51,711 --> 00:23:54,860
it's not going to drop that from 40 
percent to 20 percent.

496
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,560
So maybe 40 to 35.
Is that reasonable?

497
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,810
Still a lot back.
Yeah,

498
00:23:59,811 --> 00:24:03,080
that's,
I would say maybe 40 to 39 or 38.

499
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,040
Jesus.
Yeah.

500
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,600
So,
so,

501
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:07,460
so here's the deal,
you know,

502
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,410
uh,
we can't,

503
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:15,280
it doesn't matter who.
So that the whole recent healthcare 

504
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,980
debate with the affordable care act and,
and then the current administration 

505
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:22,451
suggesting something different.
That whole discussion revolved around 

506
00:24:22,451 --> 00:24:22,730
how we're going to pay for health care,
you know,

507
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,080
insurance,
health insurance.

508
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:29,530
But we have to understand that health 
insurance is not the same thing as 

509
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:29,530
healthcare,
right?

510
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:32,030
It's a method,
it's a method of paying for healthcare.

511
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,720
And my key point in the book is it 
doesn't matter what method of health 

512
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,820
that we use to pay for healthcare,
whether it's the government,

513
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:43,370
whether it's corporations or whether 
it's individuals,

514
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:48,710
there is no method that sustainable in 
the face of the rising rates of chronic 

515
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,530
disease that we're seeing,
that there's.

516
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:54,380
There's nothing that would be 
fascinating as I am pretty aware of this

517
00:24:54,381 --> 00:24:57,230
stuff and I didn't know what you're 
telling me and I'm stunned.

518
00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:02,290
I'm stunned at the number of people with
chronic disease and I'm stunned at the 

519
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:03,110
number of people that are either 
prediabetic or diabetic.

520
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,280
I really don't know how to digest that.
That's,

521
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:10,630
that's horrific.
And that could be attributed almost 

522
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:14,330
entirely to diet in a lack of extra sets
of preventable disease.

523
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:19,220
That's the crazy thing.
Type two diabetes is a fully preventable

524
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,430
condition in type one diabetes varies in
what way?

525
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,630
That's an autoimmune condition and it's 
strongly genetically mediated.

526
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:31,660
So it's.
Which means that it doesn't necessarily 

527
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,980
mean that if you have the genes you're 
going to get the disease,

528
00:25:33,981 --> 00:25:34,820
but there's,
you know,

529
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:39,910
50 percent of the risk I think is the 
statistic that I've seen a of type one 

530
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:44,801
diabetes is genetic.
Whereas we know now that 85 percent of 

531
00:25:44,801 --> 00:25:49,451
the risk of of disease in generaL comes 
down to environmental and behavioral 

532
00:25:49,451 --> 00:25:50,540
factors.
Behavioral meaning you die,

533
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:53,330
yeah,
or or your sleep or your,

534
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,490
you know,
your physical activity,

535
00:25:55,491 --> 00:25:56,780
stress management,
et cetera.

536
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:00,710
So that means only 15 percent of the 
risk of disease is genetic,

537
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:03,800
you know,
purely genetically a driven.

538
00:26:03,801 --> 00:26:08,801
Whereas the other 85 percent,
which is the vast majority is actually 

539
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:11,810
under our control.
I was looking at a statistic that made a

540
00:26:11,811 --> 00:26:16,811
correlation between sleep and weight 
loss and saying that people who slept an

541
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:21,770
average of eight to 10 hours a day had a
significant,

542
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:28,190
a significant,
significantly less body fat and weighed 

543
00:26:28,611 --> 00:26:33,611
less and lost more weight than people 
who did the exact same activity but 

544
00:26:33,611 --> 00:26:35,300
slept four to six hours.
Yeah.

545
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:40,420
I would say that among a people who 
research a weight regulation,

546
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:46,240
sleep is now recognized as being the 
second most influential lifestyle factor

547
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,970
that determines our weight aside from 
diet low.

548
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:55,350
I had I ahead of physical activity,
so I got a couple of good ones for you.

549
00:26:56,190 --> 00:27:01,190
A single night of sleep deprivation has 
been shown to cause mild insulin 

550
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:05,511
resistance,
even in healthy people with no 

551
00:27:05,511 --> 00:27:05,511
preexisting blood sugar disorders.

552
00:27:05,511 --> 00:27:10,310
So just one night of not sleeping well 
can cause a little bit of insulin 

553
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:10,310
resistance the next day.
I mean,

554
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:10,530
it's transient,
it goes,

555
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:12,750
goes away,
but that's significant.

556
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,440
There was a study where they,
they deprive people of sleep for eight 

557
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,251
nights in a row pretty severely.
It wasn't obviously not total sleep 

558
00:27:22,251 --> 00:27:25,881
deprivation because they'd be dead,
but you really be dead for eight nights 

559
00:27:25,881 --> 00:27:25,980
in a row.
I think so,

560
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,940
yeah.
I mean a partial partial but significant

561
00:27:29,941 --> 00:27:31,950
sleep deprivation for eight nights in a 
row.

562
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:37,290
these people ate an additional 566 
calories a day,

563
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:43,010
um,
during that period with no changes in 

564
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:45,951
resting energy expenditure.
So that's equivalent to gaining a pound 

565
00:27:45,951 --> 00:27:47,430
a week of bodyweight or 52 pounds in a 
year.

566
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:52,080
So most people won't have that severe of
sleep deprivation,

567
00:27:52,081 --> 00:27:55,110
but if you just even have mild sleep 
deprivation,

568
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,630
you know,
over a significant period,

569
00:27:57,631 --> 00:28:01,020
what if that could account for 10 pounds
of weight gain a year and over,

570
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,490
you know,
10 years,

571
00:28:02,491 --> 00:28:02,950
you're,
you're,

572
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,730
you're talking about a lot of weekends.

573
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,080
Yeah.
So is it because you're sleepy,

574
00:28:07,081 --> 00:28:09,980
so you just force yourself to eat food?
Like what?

575
00:28:09,981 --> 00:28:10,650
no,
it just,

576
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:15,670
it totally screwed.
It totally screws with hormone 

577
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:17,690
production and all the hormones that 
regulate appetite and satiety and,

578
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:22,710
and things like that.
So his laptop and his tire and appetites

579
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:28,040
higher.
It's hard to get satiated and it also 

580
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,350
decreases your willpower and judgment 
around food.

581
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:35,400
So people are likely to make worse 
choices when it comes to food.

582
00:28:35,401 --> 00:28:36,710
I know I do.
yeah.

583
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:37,890
Do.
If I'm really,

584
00:28:37,891 --> 00:28:42,891
really tired,
I immediately go to like bullshit 

585
00:28:42,891 --> 00:28:42,891
cheeseburgers or something.
Absolutely.

586
00:28:42,891 --> 00:28:42,891
It's,
it's,

587
00:28:42,891 --> 00:28:47,580
uh,
it's part of what has been documented 

588
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:47,580
that happens.
yeah.

589
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,980
You like reward yourself with something 
that's terrible for you.

590
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,700
Yeah.
Know probably in,

591
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:58,810
there's,
that's also related to the changes in 

592
00:28:58,810 --> 00:28:58,810
brain chemistry that happened.
So.

593
00:28:58,810 --> 00:28:59,520
Wow.
Yeah.

594
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:00,360
Wow.
And,

595
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:05,390
and now we know that a third of 
americans get fewer than six hours of 

596
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:09,471
sleep and outside of maybe three percent
of the population that has a gene that 

597
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:12,430
allows them to,
you know,

598
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,290
be okay with that,
that few hours of sleep,

599
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:21,620
the vast majority of people need seven 
to eight and a half hours of sleep to 

600
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:21,620
function properly.

601
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,700
And that's been clearly documented.
Yeah.

602
00:29:23,701 --> 00:29:27,660
I had read something about outliers in 
terms of performance outliers.

603
00:29:27,661 --> 00:29:29,010
There are a lot of people,
um,

604
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:34,370
that uh,
like entrepreneurs guys were killing it 

605
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:34,390
out there.
They're,

606
00:29:34,391 --> 00:29:36,330
they're getting like four to five hours 
sleep at night.

607
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,890
And I was stunned by that and I was 
like,

608
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,100
how's that possible account?
How are these people that are,

609
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:46,260
you know,
they're doing all these physical 

610
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:46,260
activities working out,
running their business.

611
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:48,460
And then I found out about adderall.
Right.

612
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,220
So there's that.
Yeah.

613
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:51,490
I mean,
as I said,

614
00:29:51,491 --> 00:29:56,491
there are some genetic polymorphisms 
that we at least some research suggests 

615
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,530
that allow people to,
you know,

616
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:02,260
deal with less sleep than others.
But yeah,

617
00:30:02,261 --> 00:30:04,870
I think in that community there's a lot 
of stimulant use.

618
00:30:04,871 --> 00:30:08,090
It's driving that and at some point 
they're going to pay the price.

619
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,610
Yeah.
They need to come clean about that.

620
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:13,090
Like that's the dirty little secret.
I have friends that are entrepreneurs in

621
00:30:13,091 --> 00:30:16,240
silicon valley people and did the way 
they describe it,

622
00:30:16,241 --> 00:30:18,100
it's like,
like people chewing gum.

623
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,880
It's just everywhere.
Everyone is doing new vigil provigil 

624
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:28,120
which are apparently less problematic 
and then adderall across the board.

625
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:29,890
Yeah,
it's crazy.

626
00:30:29,891 --> 00:30:30,700
I mean we're,
we're,

627
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:36,020
we're making choices now,
both individually and collectively that 

628
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,950
are taking us in the wrong direction.
And you know,

629
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:39,750
the,
this,

630
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:45,190
this week I've shared a few stats that 
kind of blew you away and they've blown 

631
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:45,780
me away to,
you know,

632
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:48,490
when I was researching the book,
this is how it all came together.

633
00:30:48,491 --> 00:30:50,470
For me it was,
it was like a wake up call,

634
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:55,560
you know,
so I have a six year old daughter and 

635
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:59,191
now you have kids.
Today's kids are the first generation 

636
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:01,030
that are expected to live shorter 
lifespans than us,

637
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,140
their parents.

638
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:04,840
That's just crazy.
You know,

639
00:31:04,841 --> 00:31:08,800
as long as we,
based on this statistic about diabetes,

640
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,920
the dramatic increase in chronic 
disease.

641
00:31:11,921 --> 00:31:14,710
So as long as we've been measuring it in
the modern world,

642
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,870
lifespans just been going like this,
you know,

643
00:31:16,871 --> 00:31:19,150
there's been a few blips due to 
pandemics,

644
00:31:19,151 --> 00:31:21,610
like the spanish flu,
but for as long as we've been measuring,

645
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:22,750
it's just going up,
up,

646
00:31:22,751 --> 00:31:23,170
up,
up,

647
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,540
and now this is the first generation of 
kids.

648
00:31:25,541 --> 00:31:28,090
It's actually expected start going back 
in the other direction.

649
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,580
I showed my kids that,
that sugar documentary,

650
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:35,610
my wife showed it to them.
It lasted about four months and then 

651
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:35,610
they will like,
who gives a shit?

652
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,120
Let's get back to the ice cream.

653
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:44,340
The kids,
it's not like it's hard because we're 

654
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:47,380
hard that this is where the evolutionary
perspective is so important for people 

655
00:31:47,411 --> 00:31:52,240
to understand where we're hardwired,
to seek out foods that are calorie dense

656
00:31:52,241 --> 00:31:57,241
and highly rewarding and by rewarding,
I'm talking about that term in the 

657
00:31:57,241 --> 00:32:01,741
scientific context context,
which means eating something makes you 

658
00:32:01,741 --> 00:32:03,370
want to eat more of it,
right,

659
00:32:03,371 --> 00:32:05,140
so a potato,
chips,

660
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:10,590
ice cream,
highly rewarding because you'll keep 

661
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,200
eating them even beyond the point where 
your hunger has been satisfied.

662
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:16,270
A baked potato with no salt or butter,
not very rewarding.

663
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,610
You know you'll eat if you're hungry,
you'll eat it,

664
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:23,820
but you won't eat more than your hungry 
for and even a steak which is most 

665
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:28,471
people like and it's tastes good.
When's the last time you heard about 

666
00:32:28,471 --> 00:32:32,011
somebody bingeing on a steak?
It doesn't really happen because it's 

667
00:32:32,011 --> 00:32:35,911
not highly rewarding in that way,
but human beings evolved in an 

668
00:32:35,911 --> 00:32:39,961
environment of food scarcity,
so we have these wired genetic

669
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:45,400
biological mechanisms that caused us to 
seek out foods that have a lot of 

670
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:49,931
calories and that are very palatable and
rewarding because that would signal to 

671
00:32:51,441 --> 00:32:53,870
us that they have different,
different nutrients,

672
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,520
macro nutrients,
flavors,

673
00:32:55,521 --> 00:33:00,521
et cetera.
And we're in an environment of food 

674
00:33:00,521 --> 00:33:01,280
scarcity that works really well because,
you know,

675
00:33:01,281 --> 00:33:04,760
stocking up on calories would allow us 
to survive a period of,

676
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,720
of,
you know,

677
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,710
famine or,
or food shortage or you know,

678
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,790
unable to locate food,
etc.

679
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:16,390
So we have all these mechanisms that 
were originally designed to help us 

680
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:17,930
survive starvation in a natural 
environment.

681
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:22,040
That's all well and good when we're 
living in that kind of environment.

682
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:25,310
But what happens when we live in an 
environment where there is a seven slash

683
00:33:25,311 --> 00:33:30,311
11 on every corner and amazon delivering
food your door and a costco around the,

684
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:34,790
around the block.
Food is everywhere.

685
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:39,940
And so all of these mechanisms that 
actually helped us to survive in our 

686
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:43,631
ancestral environment cause set us up 
for failure in this modern food 

687
00:33:44,541 --> 00:33:49,541
environment.
And we capitalize on that with things 

688
00:33:49,541 --> 00:33:49,541
like the banana split.
Yeah.

689
00:33:49,541 --> 00:33:54,011
Well the thing is that big big food,
they hire scientists who understand 

690
00:33:56,361 --> 00:34:01,361
these mechanisms and specifically 
designed foods to hit all of those 

691
00:34:01,361 --> 00:34:02,560
circuits.
You know,

692
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:07,900
what do you think is like probably is 
there a statistically most addictive 

693
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,070
food?
Uh,

694
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,880
I don't know actually the answer to that
question.

695
00:34:10,881 --> 00:34:15,881
I mean there's,
there's a lot of controversy about 

696
00:34:15,881 --> 00:34:17,831
whether sugar is addictive in the sense,
in the true sense of the way that 

697
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:20,480
scientists use the term addictive like 
meth.

698
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:22,010
Yeah,
exactly.

699
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:24,200
But,
And they're both sides of that debate.

700
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:27,380
Um,
but I think most of us can have,

701
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:28,190
you know,
just on our,

702
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:33,220
in our own personal experience can kind 
of assess the effect that sugar has on 

703
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:35,330
us or our kids or whatever it.

704
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:39,200
It's highly rewarding in the sense that 
it makes us want more and more of it.

705
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:44,510
It's not addicted to me in the sense of 
like I get a detox if I'm not having it,

706
00:34:44,511 --> 00:34:48,920
but if it's around me and I wanted,
the craving is very creepy.

707
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,880
Right.
You know,

708
00:34:49,881 --> 00:34:52,970
like what is this jamie?
Most addictive foods?

709
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,070
Pizza is number one.
Yeah.

710
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,500
Wow.
It's based on a health line.com

711
00:34:57,501 --> 00:34:59,120
study.
I'll tell you what,

712
00:34:59,121 --> 00:34:59,530
man,
this,

713
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:02,750
there might be something of that was 
when we were in New York and uh,

714
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:05,960
you brought over those slices of pizza.
Goddamn,

715
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:10,990
those are good.
they couldn't figure out a way to make 

716
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:10,990
that pizza here we have real problems.
Well,

717
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:15,731
it's interesting that you showed that 
because I'm the top six foods in the 

718
00:35:15,831 --> 00:35:18,260
american diet,
according to cow,

719
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:23,320
the amount of calories that they 
comprise in our diet or a pizza bread,

720
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:28,430
grain based desserts,
alcohol,

721
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:31,730
sugar sweetened beverages and chicken 
dishes,

722
00:35:31,731 --> 00:35:35,060
primarily fried chicken dishes,
like chicken nuggets from mcdonald's.

723
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:40,660
Those six foods comprise the majority of
the calories that the average american 

724
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,530
eats.
And then you look at our ancestral diet.

725
00:35:43,531 --> 00:35:45,570
It was mostly,
you know,

726
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:48,330
meat and fish,
wild fruits and vegetables,

727
00:35:48,331 --> 00:35:51,120
not even the domesticated varieties that
we eat today,

728
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:54,570
nuts and seeds and a lot of starchy 
fibrous plants,

729
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:59,940
um,
many of which aren't even available to 

730
00:35:59,940 --> 00:35:59,940
us at this point,
but,

731
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:03,290
you know,
sweet potatoes would be our kind of 

732
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:04,911
modern analog of that.
And so you have a situation where we 

733
00:36:04,951 --> 00:36:07,140
evolved in the context of eating those 
foods,

734
00:36:07,141 --> 00:36:09,240
which are,
they're nutrient dense,

735
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:15,120
they're anti inflammatory and they're 
naturally low in calories and they're 

736
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:15,540
all foods that are very hard for us to 
overeat.

737
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:20,750
Again,
like it's when you don't hear about 

738
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:20,750
people bingeing on broccoli,
you don't hear about them.

739
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:23,300
Bingeing on steak,
you your money macadamia nuts,

740
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:24,690
man.
I yesterday,

741
00:36:24,691 --> 00:36:27,480
last night I got home and I just had 14 
sweet potatoes.

742
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:32,160
I hear about that.
And even if they have sweet potatoes,

743
00:36:32,161 --> 00:36:34,860
a lot of times people put brown sugar on
them,

744
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,640
right?
Like maple syrup or something like that,

745
00:36:38,641 --> 00:36:40,740
which then you might be,
you might overeat them,

746
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:42,870
but if in those foods in their natural 
state,

747
00:36:42,871 --> 00:36:45,930
we're not going to overeat them.
We're going to eat til we're satiated.

748
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:51,450
um,
but all the other foods that I just 

749
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:51,450
mentioned,
those top six foods,

750
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:52,950
pizza,
grain based desserts like cake bread,

751
00:36:52,951 --> 00:36:55,380
et cetera,
they're all foods that trigger all those

752
00:36:55,381 --> 00:36:58,710
reward circuits in a big way.
And we've all had the experience,

753
00:36:58,711 --> 00:37:02,400
I'm sure of overeating pretty or 
overconsuming everything on that list.

754
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:04,230
I used to always,
uh,

755
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:09,280
coming home from jujitsu,
I would order an extra large pizza and 

756
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,190
eat it myself.
It was this big,

757
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:15,750
it was huge and I would get,
I would get either pineapple and double 

758
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:20,890
pineapple on double anchovies,
which I know some people think it's 

759
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:20,890
disgusting,
but it's very delicious.

760
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:24,170
Or I would get a pepperoni and mushrooms
and I would kill that thing.

761
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:27,800
And then afterwards I would literally 
feel like somebody opened up my mouth,

762
00:37:27,801 --> 00:37:32,801
like they were trying to force feed of 
goose to make fog fagua and they just 

763
00:37:32,801 --> 00:37:36,431
poured cement into my stomach and then I
just lay there and just feel terrible 

764
00:37:36,431 --> 00:37:41,081
and feel thAt insulin spike and your 
whole body just reacts this sludge that 

765
00:37:41,081 --> 00:37:43,820
you're forcing it to process.
Just doe,

766
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:45,770
you know?
And she's.

767
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:47,120
And the cheese is great though.

768
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:49,420
Yeah,
I mean it's a step,

769
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:51,260
but it's that,
that it seems to.

770
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:55,780
The doe is what gives you that ball.
That's the heavy got bomb.

771
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,960
Yeah,
the gut bomb.

772
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,850
Yeah.
Why is it so good though?

773
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,580
Because I'll tell you what,
those alternatives,

774
00:38:01,581 --> 00:38:03,950
they suck and that they're not that 
good.

775
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,210
They're good food,
but they did.

776
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,620
Still,
there's not the same.

777
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:10,190
There's no free ride right there.
No decadent alternative.

778
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:14,180
Although I did find a very good cookie.
There's a company called no.

779
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,870
Do you know no foods and seeing that go 
grab one of those things.

780
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,010
Yeah,
they have.

781
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,000
Oh,
we got one right there.

782
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,620
Yeah,
it's not bad,

783
00:38:21,621 --> 00:38:22,610
man.
They're fucking.

784
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,100
No can dabble,
yada.

785
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:25,700
Yeah.
Yeah.

786
00:38:25,701 --> 00:38:30,080
I mean I'm sugars like a s for the 
entire cookie.

787
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:33,710
Twenty eight grams,
28 grams of sugar.

788
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:35,060
It's a big ass cook.
Yeah.

789
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:35,920
I see that.
And,

790
00:38:35,921 --> 00:38:36,100
but

791
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,610
it's all like,
um,

792
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:39,910
and,
and I actually enjoy eating it,

793
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:42,550
but if you look at the ingredients,
it's all okay.

794
00:38:42,551 --> 00:38:44,530
Here we go with almonds.
Coconuts,

795
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:47,030
egg whites,
flaxseed,

796
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:49,210
chia seed,
zero trans fat,

797
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:54,070
and a 16 grams.
Eighteen grams of protein,

798
00:38:54,071 --> 00:38:56,950
four grams net carbs,
10 grams of fiber.

799
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:59,230
Yeah,
for a coupon and it tastes pretty good,

800
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:04,500
but it's not as good as not a large 
pizza with anchovies and pineapple on 

801
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,520
it.
Not as good as like a Mrs.

802
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:11,520
Fields chocolate chip cookie.
YoU know when you pull it apart in that 

803
00:39:11,861 --> 00:39:14,740
string of chocolate,
you know that absolutely.

804
00:39:14,741 --> 00:39:17,920
I mean the nice glass of milk and those 
are all good because they,

805
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,390
they,
they,

806
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:20,830
like I said,
the trigger,

807
00:39:20,831 --> 00:39:24,790
all of those hardwired reward circuits.
They push all the right buttons.

808
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,630
Yeah,
they get you.

809
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:29,230
It is amazing how many foods there are 
that are like that.

810
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:32,320
If you stop and think about like just 
going down the street,

811
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:36,180
walk in a normal street where there's a 
bunch of stores and restaurants,

812
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:38,380
like how much of that stuff is bad for 
you?

813
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:43,410
It's primarily bad for you.
It's primarily bad and you think the 

814
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:44,440
whole modern food environment is that 
way and that's what I mean.

815
00:39:44,441 --> 00:39:49,441
We're set up to fail.
Anyone who said who sets out to be lean 

816
00:39:49,441 --> 00:39:52,360
and fit and healthy is swimming 
upstream.

817
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,270
You have to be put in some serious 
extra.

818
00:39:54,271 --> 00:39:59,271
You have to constantly be putting in 
effort because there's a barrage of 

819
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,490
advertisements you walk into a grocery 
store,

820
00:40:00,491 --> 00:40:05,491
all of those foods are triggering all of
those circuits that make us seek and 

821
00:40:06,101 --> 00:40:11,101
crave those foods because those are 
evolutionary mechanisms that cannot be 

822
00:40:11,101 --> 00:40:14,530
consciously overridden very easily,
and this is why weight loss continues to

823
00:40:14,531 --> 00:40:19,531
be a billion dollar multibillion dollar 
industry because information is not 

824
00:40:19,531 --> 00:40:21,400
enough for most people.

825
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:24,730
It's not enough just to know what foods 
are healthy,

826
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:29,970
which foods are unhealthy because we're.
We're operating from a much deeper 

827
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,070
system.
The olympics,

828
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:36,500
the limbic system are kind of lizard 
brain that is driving our preferences 

829
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:41,371
for food and what foods we seek in which
foods we don't see and that's below the 

830
00:40:41,371 --> 00:40:44,170
level of conscious thought that no where
we say,

831
00:40:44,171 --> 00:40:49,171
okay,
I know that food's not good and I know 

832
00:40:49,171 --> 00:40:50,200
this food is good,
but then that lizard brain is like,

833
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:52,320
eh,
you know you had a delicious you.

834
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:57,570
It's almost like if you're walking by,
like if you have some potato chips or 

835
00:40:58,661 --> 00:41:00,520
something on the shelf and you walk by 
it,

836
00:41:00,521 --> 00:41:05,521
it's almost like there's an invisible 
hand on your shoulder pushing you 

837
00:41:05,521 --> 00:41:05,521
towards you can.
You can kind of go hand.

838
00:41:05,521 --> 00:41:06,670
I stop pushing,
stop pushing me,

839
00:41:06,671 --> 00:41:08,080
or you can go,
all right.

840
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,000
Yeah.
You just kind of give and here's the key

841
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:13,420
thing to understand too,
that it's not because you're weak person

842
00:41:13,421 --> 00:41:18,421
or you don't have willpower.
It's because you're a human being and 

843
00:41:18,421 --> 00:41:18,421
that's how your brain is programmed.
Yeah.

844
00:41:18,421 --> 00:41:23,041
That is a very important thing to 
realize that there's a reason why it's 

845
00:41:23,041 --> 00:41:25,360
difficult for you and and even for 
people that think it's,

846
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:26,560
well,
it's not difficult for me,

847
00:41:26,561 --> 00:41:31,561
man.
Well maybe if you've conditioned 

848
00:41:31,561 --> 00:41:32,290
yourself and if you've conditioned your 
body and condition,

849
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,100
especially your diet,
there's something

850
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:38,630
that does happen when your gut biome 
changes where your cravings change.

851
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:40,760
Absolutely,
but if you're eating a lot of sugar,

852
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:45,290
it is incredibly difficult to get off 
that because that is what that gut biome

853
00:41:45,291 --> 00:41:50,291
wants and there's some sort of a very 
strange difficult to pin down feeling 

854
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:53,510
that would.
That craving is.

855
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:56,210
It's very difficult to sort of 
intellectualize,

856
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,220
right?
Like if you have to go to the bathroom,

857
00:41:58,221 --> 00:41:59,240
it's very clear.
Oh my god,

858
00:41:59,241 --> 00:42:01,160
I got to pee.
It's like there,

859
00:42:01,161 --> 00:42:02,600
you feel it,
you know what it is,

860
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:07,130
but the weird hunger craving for sugar 
is almost like you can't grab it.

861
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:10,070
You can't like hold on to and go,
this is what I'm talking about.

862
00:42:10,071 --> 00:42:10,940
This is that thing.

863
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:12,880
Well,
there's the example I like to use.

864
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:17,280
there's a parasite that the whole life 
cycle is really interesting.

865
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:18,550
You probably aware of it.
It,

866
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:22,950
it ends up in mice and it changes the 
behavior.

867
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Yeah.
Toxoplasma gondii changes the behavior 

868
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,421
of mice so that they are dumber in terms
of their ability to evade getting eaten 

869
00:42:31,091 --> 00:42:32,170
by a cat.
Yeah,

870
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:36,970
and then so then they get eaten by the 
cat and then the toxoplasma transfers to

871
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:40,480
the cat where and goes to the cat's 
brain where it normally lives,

872
00:42:40,481 --> 00:42:43,380
so that's an example of how a tiny,
tiny little micro,

873
00:42:43,381 --> 00:42:48,381
but you can't even see with your eye can
powerfully control behavior and as you 

874
00:42:48,381 --> 00:42:52,441
just said,
we've got trillions of microbes in our 

875
00:42:52,441 --> 00:42:55,420
gut that control our behavior and things
like our food preferences and cravings.

876
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:59,340
We had robert sapolsky on the podcast 
talking about that and he said that some

877
00:42:59,341 --> 00:43:04,341
of the mice,
it actually rewires their sexual reward 

878
00:43:04,341 --> 00:43:05,610
system,
makes them attracted to the smell of cat

879
00:43:05,611 --> 00:43:06,340
urine.
Right?

880
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:09,090
So their,
their testes swell and they're,

881
00:43:09,091 --> 00:43:14,091
they're,
they're literally like horny little 

882
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:14,091
zombies running straight towards the 
cats.

883
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:17,340
It completely rewires their fear of cats
that goes out the window.

884
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:22,610
And the reason being is that the only 
way that toxo plasma can reproduce is 

885
00:43:22,921 --> 00:43:24,630
inside the cat's gut.
Yup.

886
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:29,870
Which is just insane.
Like what kind of a twisted system and 

887
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:32,040
how did this evolve over all these 
years,

888
00:43:32,041 --> 00:43:37,041
like the gut biome and gut bacteria.
It is so fascinating to me.

889
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:43,720
Here's a,
here's an interesting way of looking at 

890
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:43,720
it.
Do you know justin sonnenburg?

891
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,920
He's a microbiologist at stanford.
Really fast.

892
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,820
Interesting guy.
Brilliant.

893
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:53,990
He,
I'm going to Paraphrase this because I 

894
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:56,061
won't get the quote exactly right,
but he wrote a book about the gut 

895
00:43:56,061 --> 00:43:59,211
microbiome and he said something to the 
effect of humans or are just the 

896
00:44:00,121 --> 00:44:05,121
elaborate elaborate vessels for the 
propagation of microorganisms probably 

897
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:12,390
right.
He's basically saying that we're kind of

898
00:44:12,391 --> 00:44:16,260
the evolutionary vehicle or tool for,
for the microbes that live in our gut.

899
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,120
They've been around a lot longer than 
us.

900
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:20,010
Um,
a lot longer.

901
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,530
They outnumber us,
you know,

902
00:44:22,531 --> 00:44:23,040
the,
the,

903
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:28,190
the number of microbial cells in the 
body are more than the number of human 

904
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:31,971
cells.
So there's lots of different ways to 

905
00:44:31,971 --> 00:44:32,340
interpret,
but I think

906
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:37,520
at the very minimum you,
you start to see how important that 

907
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,540
microbial community is to our overall 
health and also our behavior.

908
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:41,670
Yeah.
And if you really want to get creepy,

909
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:45,330
think about how like categorically they 
don't vary individually,

910
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:48,290
like they're,
they're essentially the exact same thing

911
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:53,530
in mass numbers,
acting in the interest of the mass 

912
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:55,560
numbers.
And then influencing us,

913
00:44:55,561 --> 00:45:00,561
which vary widely and our different 
actions propagate them in different 

914
00:45:00,901 --> 00:45:02,400
ways.
I'm freaking out.

915
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:06,570
It's especially weird too,
when you think that all of that stuff,

916
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:08,730
all of those microorganisms that are in 
our gut,

917
00:45:08,731 --> 00:45:12,030
they're not actually in our body.
So they're not really part of us.

918
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:13,380
They're just hanging out there.
Well,

919
00:45:13,381 --> 00:45:18,381
think about a tunnel.
So you go through a tunnel under a 

920
00:45:18,381 --> 00:45:18,660
river,
you're not in the river,

921
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:22,980
woo.
You're just in a tunnel under the river.

922
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:28,230
And our gut is a hollow tube that goes 
from our mouth to our anus,

923
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:33,320
intersects our body.
But everything inside the tube is 

924
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:33,540
technically outside of the body.

925
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:44,380
So their influence,
they're influencing us from inside the 

926
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:44,540
tunnel,
from inside of the tunnel.

927
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:47,870
They're not really inside of our bodies,
so they're kind of running the show,

928
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:53,080
but they're not really in us.
So it's like a car inside the tunnel 

929
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:56,861
that's controlling the river.
Yet jesus christ more freaking out,

930
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:02,150
freaking out.
When I thought about that.

931
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,030
And the crazy thing is that they can 
affect.

932
00:46:05,031 --> 00:46:06,530
mood,
can affect,

933
00:46:06,531 --> 00:46:08,320
depression,
can affect,

934
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:09,980
uh,
your ambition,

935
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:14,760
the way you behave.
In a study on the way down here,

936
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:19,770
and I did a feed of all the new research
and it showed that overgrowth of 

937
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:21,680
bacteria in our small intestine,
which is part of our got,

938
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:26,120
is associated with heart problems,
so it's,

939
00:46:26,121 --> 00:46:28,550
you know,
and they don't actually know why yet,

940
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:30,410
but so,
so,

941
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:31,250
um,
you know,

942
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:36,340
something going on and with the cars in 
the tunnel is really tweaking the river 

943
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:36,710
and just about every way you can 
imagine.

944
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:40,460
It's not just about gut as you know,
it affects every system in the body.

945
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:45,610
So paul was saying that one of the 
people that he worked with found during 

946
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:49,721
his residency that there's a 
disproportionate number of motorcycle 

947
00:46:49,721 --> 00:46:53,291
accidents that were attributed to people
were infected by toxoplasma because it 

948
00:46:53,291 --> 00:46:54,520
made them more impulsive.
Right.

949
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:57,350
I can change human behavior as Well.
Yeah.

950
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,600
Well,
I think we talked about this last time,

951
00:46:59,601 --> 00:47:04,601
but the prevalent theory now I'm.
What causes depression is that it's a 

952
00:47:04,601 --> 00:47:06,590
disrupted gut microbiome that causes 
inflammation.

953
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:12,200
It,
it leads to the production of what are 

954
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:12,200
called cytokines.
They're chemical messengers,

955
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:15,770
inflammatory cytokines.
They traveled across the gut barrier.

956
00:47:15,771 --> 00:47:20,771
They go into the blood,
travel up into the brain and cross the 

957
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:24,851
blood brain barrier,
and then they suppress the activity in 

958
00:47:24,851 --> 00:47:27,130
the frontal cortex,
which causes all the telltale signs and 

959
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:28,250
symptoms of depression.
So what if depression,

960
00:47:28,251 --> 00:47:30,100
which we have thought about either

961
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:30,840
as a,
you know,

962
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:35,290
disruption of brain chemistry or 
something that's purely situational,

963
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:36,750
is actually,
uh,

964
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:40,390
you know,
has a physiological causes as a driver.

965
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:43,690
Now that's not to say that those 
situational factors don't matter.

966
00:47:43,691 --> 00:47:48,691
I don't want to be reductionist here and
say depression is only caused by gut 

967
00:47:48,691 --> 00:47:49,600
inflammation.
I think that's ridiculous.

968
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:51,240
But,
uh,

969
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:54,580
the problem is the average person goes 
into the doctor with depression.

970
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:59,940
They're going to come out of that office
with a prescription for an 

971
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:02,521
antidepressant.
There's not going to be any 

972
00:48:02,521 --> 00:48:04,471
investigation into their got and whether
they have inflammation in the gut and 

973
00:48:04,471 --> 00:48:09,391
intestinal permeability,
there's not gonna be a referral to a 

974
00:48:09,391 --> 00:48:10,330
gastroenterologist to,
to check that out.

975
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:11,470
And this is,
of course,

976
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:13,450
one of the problems with the 
conventional system.

977
00:48:13,451 --> 00:48:18,250
The way it's set up is we had a doctor 
for every different part of the body and

978
00:48:18,251 --> 00:48:19,660
there's no quarterback.

979
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:24,950
It's really overseeing that whole thing 
that ideally that would be the primary 

980
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:28,771
care provider,
but because their appointments are 10 

981
00:48:28,771 --> 00:48:28,771
minutes,
they've got 2,500

982
00:48:28,771 --> 00:48:30,370
patients on their roster.
There's no time for that.

983
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:35,460
Yeah.
You'd have to find a doctor that's very 

984
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:37,471
meticulous.
It's willing to go over your blood work 

985
00:48:37,471 --> 00:48:38,260
for you and check out what your diet is.
Yeah.

986
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:42,130
We'll take ours and wnl as they say,
we're not looking.

987
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:46,300
So imagine a patient that goes into the 
doctor and they've got depression.

988
00:48:46,301 --> 00:48:50,050
Let's say they've got a eczema or 
psoriasis.

989
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:55,410
They've got a digestive issues and 
they've got a brain fog,

990
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:02,040
cognitive problems like a whole big 
roster of symptoms and the and the 

991
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,530
primary care provider might give them an
antidepressant for the depression.

992
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:07,180
They give them a steroid skin cream for 
the skin problem.

993
00:49:07,181 --> 00:49:07,900
They,
you know,

994
00:49:07,901 --> 00:49:08,340
they,
they,

995
00:49:08,341 --> 00:49:10,240
they leave with a handful of 
medications.

996
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:15,750
But what if there was one thing that was
causing all these problems are one 

997
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:16,720
underlying cause.
It was leading to all that.

998
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:18,280
So just,
you know,

999
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:23,320
in this example,
what if that patient had gluten 

1000
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:23,440
intolerance and they hadn't been 
properly diagnosed?

1001
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:28,920
We know now from the research that 
gluten intolerance doesn't just cause 

1002
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:29,380
the gi distress,
a lot of people get,

1003
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:31,480
it also can cause,
you know,

1004
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:33,790
it's associated with dermatitis,
which is eczema.

1005
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:38,350
It's associated with all kinds of 
cognitive and neurological problems.

1006
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:43,710
So a single food protein could be 
leading to all of these different 

1007
00:49:44,711 --> 00:49:46,540
symptoms.
But in the conventional system,

1008
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:48,400
they might go to the primary care 
doctor,

1009
00:49:48,401 --> 00:49:50,200
then they get a referral to the 
dermatologist,

1010
00:49:50,201 --> 00:49:52,030
they get a referral to the 
gastroenterologist,

1011
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:55,090
they maybe get a referral to a 
neurologist or a psychiatrist.

1012
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:58,720
They're seeing all these separate people
to deal with all these separate symptoms

1013
00:49:59,020 --> 00:49:59,420
like,
you know,

1014
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:01,180
playing whack a mole with the symptoms.

1015
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:03,610
They take one drug,
uh,

1016
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:06,910
the antidepressant,
but then maybe the antidepressant causes

1017
00:50:06,911 --> 00:50:09,550
constipation.
So then you go to the gastroenterologist

1018
00:50:09,551 --> 00:50:10,900
and they get a drug for the,
you know,

1019
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:14,350
a laxative for the constipation.
And then before,

1020
00:50:14,351 --> 00:50:17,320
you know,
it's just this incredibly complex web of

1021
00:50:17,321 --> 00:50:22,321
all these drug interactions and,
and all the focus is on suppressing 

1022
00:50:22,321 --> 00:50:24,760
these symptoms with different doctors 
for different body parts.

1023
00:50:24,761 --> 00:50:28,760
When in this example,
at least it was something as simple as a

1024
00:50:28,761 --> 00:50:33,761
food protein.
It could be easily removed from the 

1025
00:50:33,761 --> 00:50:33,761
diet,
maybe not easily,

1026
00:50:33,761 --> 00:50:35,240
but you know,
gluten's in a lot of things.

1027
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:40,241
But I'm taken out and then all of those 
problems which seemed like they were 

1028
00:50:40,251 --> 00:50:45,251
separate and disconnected go away.
And that's really the promise of 

1029
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:48,830
functional medicine because instead of 
looking at things,

1030
00:50:48,831 --> 00:50:51,800
starting with the symptoms and then 
working backwards,

1031
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:53,750
we're starting from the,
the,

1032
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:55,620
the,
the inside and,

1033
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:56,600
and working out.

1034
00:50:56,690 --> 00:50:57,860
So,
you know,

1035
00:50:58,490 --> 00:51:03,260
an analogy I like to use is if you have 
a rock in your shoe and it's making your

1036
00:51:03,261 --> 00:51:06,290
foot hurt and you go to,
into the conventional system,

1037
00:51:06,291 --> 00:51:08,360
you'll end up with a diagnosis of foot 
pain.

1038
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:11,150
Or actually we'll be fancier,
you know,

1039
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:13,850
there'll be like the latin name for foot
and pain or something.

1040
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:18,950
It sounds more official and you know,
and then you'll get a painkiller and the

1041
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:20,170
painkiller will help,
you know,

1042
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:25,180
it'll reduce the pain a little bit,
but obviously it makes a lot more sense 

1043
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:26,300
to just take your shoe off and dump out 
the rock.

1044
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:31,360
ANd that's really what functional 
medicine is about now when it comes to 

1045
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:34,811
gluten intolerance,
that's one that gets dIsmissed as it 

1046
00:51:34,811 --> 00:51:34,811
sounds.
It sounds frivolous,

1047
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:35,160
like,
oh,

1048
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:37,010
all of a sudden everyone's gluten 
intolerant,

1049
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:42,011
like this is crazy.
But my belief is that there's varying 

1050
00:51:42,011 --> 00:51:45,320
levels of this and that it's something 
that people have just dismissed,

1051
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:50,560
is a weird feeling that you get after 
you eat gluten and that they're not 

1052
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:54,311
really in tune with the effect of 
inflammation and that there's a real 

1053
00:51:54,311 --> 00:51:59,081
difference between the we'd have today 
and the we'd have say the early 19 

1054
00:51:59,081 --> 00:51:59,081
hundreds.

1055
00:51:59,081 --> 00:52:00,920
It's been maniPulated.
I think there are a few reasons.

1056
00:52:00,921 --> 00:52:04,280
There's misunderstanding about this.
Number one is that,

1057
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:08,080
uh,
there up untIl recently has not been a,

1058
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:13,190
uh,
an understanding of the difference 

1059
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:13,490
between celiac disease and non celiac 
gluten sensitivity.

1060
00:52:13,491 --> 00:52:18,491
So for a long time the idea was either 
have celiac or you're not sensitive to 

1061
00:52:18,491 --> 00:52:18,890
gluten.
That's it.

1062
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:20,450
I've heard that recently.
Yeah.

1063
00:52:20,451 --> 00:52:22,610
There's no gray area that's 
preposterous.

1064
00:52:22,611 --> 00:52:27,200
Anyone who still believes that has not 
even done the most cursory search of the

1065
00:52:27,201 --> 00:52:32,201
scientific literature.
you can go in and anyone who's watching 

1066
00:52:32,201 --> 00:52:33,680
who's listening or watching can go to 
pub med.gov,

1067
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:35,810
pub,
med.gov

1068
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,630
in the search field type,
non celiac,

1069
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:42,890
gluten sensitivity or non-celiac wheat 
sensitivity and tell me how many results

1070
00:52:42,891 --> 00:52:44,060
come up,
do it.

1071
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:46,820
It's going to be a lot.
Okay,

1072
00:52:46,821 --> 00:52:50,300
and it's going to be linking and this 
goes to the second point.

1073
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:53,600
It's going to be linking not just to gut
problems and diarrhea.

1074
00:52:53,601 --> 00:52:58,601
It's going to link to all kinds of 
different conditions from depression to 

1075
00:52:58,601 --> 00:53:01,370
anxiety to heart issues,
to hormone imbalance,

1076
00:53:01,371 --> 00:53:04,190
to a cognitive problems,
etc.

1077
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:09,520
So that's the second problem is 
historically how many?

1078
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:14,561
Six hundred and 50.
Jesus and I and and there's lots of 

1079
00:53:14,561 --> 00:53:16,460
others.
If you use some different terminology,

1080
00:53:16,461 --> 00:53:20,060
you can find more.
So with celiac disease,

1081
00:53:20,061 --> 00:53:25,061
the initial idea was it,
it just causes diarrhea and severe 

1082
00:53:25,061 --> 00:53:29,501
diarrhea and cramping and so the 
assumption was that if you don't have 

1083
00:53:29,501 --> 00:53:31,380
severe diarrhea and cramping when you 
eat gluten,

1084
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:35,580
you don't have celiac and you don't have
any other kinds of gluten intolerance,

1085
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,360
but we now know that I'm there with 
celiac.

1086
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:44,850
There is,
if there are forums called atypical or 

1087
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:45,750
silent celiac,
these are forms that do not present with

1088
00:53:45,751 --> 00:53:50,751
the typical got presentation and the 
number of atypical celiac cases out.

1089
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:58,040
Not,
it's much higher than the number of 

1090
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,070
typical ones.
So a patient goes to the doctor,

1091
00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:00,890
they're having,
you know,

1092
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:02,250
uh,
headaches,

1093
00:54:02,251 --> 00:54:05,910
they're having motor problems,
they're having a,

1094
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:08,010
you know,
all kinds of other issues.

1095
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:13,220
The doctor,
if they think that celiac is only about 

1096
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:16,611
gut issues and not even think about 
testing that patient for gluten 

1097
00:54:16,611 --> 00:54:17,280
intolerance,
what kind of motor issues would you get?

1098
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:18,310
Well,
there was a,

1099
00:54:18,311 --> 00:54:20,280
there was something called a attacks 
sia,

1100
00:54:20,281 --> 00:54:24,060
which is a form of paralysis that can be
caused by gluten sensitivity.

1101
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:26,730
Yeah,
you can get paralyzed from the kids.

1102
00:54:26,731 --> 00:54:28,670
It's called gluten associated attacks,
ia,

1103
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:33,860
jesus christ.
And this is for people who are non 

1104
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:33,860
celiac.
Yeah.

1105
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:35,720
So,
so that's the second problem is,

1106
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:39,570
is again w and l we're not looking.
So the patients go to the doctor,

1107
00:54:39,571 --> 00:54:41,670
they have all these weird kind of 
complaints,

1108
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:43,950
the doctor,
but they don't have gut issues.

1109
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:48,030
So the doctor then rules out celiac or 
non celiac,

1110
00:54:48,031 --> 00:54:53,031
gluten sensitivity because they don't 
yet know that it can manifest in all 

1111
00:54:53,031 --> 00:54:54,030
these different ways.
So how is this happening?

1112
00:54:54,031 --> 00:54:57,090
Is that the tolerance that you have for 
gluten,

1113
00:54:57,091 --> 00:55:02,091
when you consume that gluten,
the gluten goes into the gut and 

1114
00:55:02,091 --> 00:55:02,850
interacts with your gut biome.
And then what's the.

1115
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:08,000
What's the mechanism?
There's two different mechanisms and 

1116
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,221
celiac.
There's an autoimmune mechanism where 

1117
00:55:10,221 --> 00:55:12,381
the proteins in gluten,
the body creates antibodies towards 

1118
00:55:12,381 --> 00:55:16,701
those proteins,
and also there's like a bystander effect

1119
00:55:17,311 --> 00:55:22,311
where certain tissues in the body that 
have similar protein structures to 

1120
00:55:22,311 --> 00:55:24,120
gluten get attacked as well.
Certain enzymes,

1121
00:55:24,121 --> 00:55:27,680
trans glutamates to transglutaminase is 
three in trans contaminates,

1122
00:55:27,681 --> 00:55:30,060
six.
And here's the thing you knoW,

1123
00:55:30,061 --> 00:55:31,680
related to what we were just talking 
about,

1124
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:35,550
transglutaminase two is is is typically 
found in the gut.

1125
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:40,700
So that's why a lot of people who have 
celiac have these gut issues is because 

1126
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:43,230
their body is actually attacking the gut
tissue and breaking it down.

1127
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:46,990
It's an autoimmune reaction,
but now we know that trend there.

1128
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:50,940
That same autoimmune reaction can be 
directed at transcript tammany's three,

1129
00:55:50,941 --> 00:55:55,941
which is primarily in the skin,
which is why something like 30 percent 

1130
00:55:55,941 --> 00:55:59,901
of people with celiac also have eczema 
and other skin problems and trans 

1131
00:55:59,901 --> 00:56:02,640
contaminated six is in the brain.
So this,

1132
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:08,180
if you,
if a person who has antibody production 

1133
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:08,910
against trans contaminated sixth eats 
gluten,

1134
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:12,810
their body attacks their brain.
Whoa.

1135
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:16,860
And that's why it breaks down the 
enzyme,

1136
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:19,620
which has played a number of important 
roLes in the brain.

1137
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:23,530
And so this is why celiac and also non 
celiac,

1138
00:56:23,531 --> 00:56:28,531
gluten sensitivity is associated with a 
whole bunch of different cognitive 

1139
00:56:28,531 --> 00:56:30,940
issues like,
and also actual motor problems.

1140
00:56:30,941 --> 00:56:33,070
I a taxi because it's attacking the 
brain.

1141
00:56:33,770 --> 00:56:38,770
The immune system's attacking the brain 
and that leads to some potentially very 

1142
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,090
serious problems.
when did they start to alter wheat?

1143
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:42,100
Like w what,
what year do you know?

1144
00:56:42,310 --> 00:56:47,310
I don't know and I do think that is an 
issue because I've,

1145
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:50,080
there's so many people that have gone to
europe,

1146
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:50,770
you know,
they eat,

1147
00:56:50,790 --> 00:56:52,450
we eat here and they go to europe and 
they can eat.

1148
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:53,880
We.
Yeah.

1149
00:56:55,130 --> 00:57:00,130
Um,
but I think there are some other things 

1150
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:02,491
that are actually more meaningful and 
significant and this leads me to the 

1151
00:57:02,491 --> 00:57:03,040
third reason why I think we've 
underestimated,

1152
00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:08,230
you know,
gluten sensitivity and why people don't 

1153
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:08,950
understand how significant it can be.
Um,

1154
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:11,980
we're not living in a,
in a vacuum,

1155
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:17,070
you know.
So let's say you've got a person who is 

1156
00:57:17,070 --> 00:57:21,720
like a hunter gatherer.
They've been living in a pristine 

1157
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:21,720
environment,
you know,

1158
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:22,580
they eat all nutrient dense,
you know,

1159
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:25,390
good food.
Their gut microbiome is thriving because

1160
00:57:25,391 --> 00:57:28,090
they'd been eating plenty of fermentable
fiber and you know,

1161
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:32,200
probiotic type of foods and they're just
super healthy.

1162
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:36,070
If that person gets exposed to gluten,
they might not have any problem.

1163
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:40,750
But then you take a person who is living
in the modern industrialized world,

1164
00:57:40,751 --> 00:57:43,510
they're sleeping five hours a night 
there.

1165
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:45,450
They've taken antibiotics,
you know,

1166
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:48,670
30 but 30 courses of antibiotics by the 
time they're an adult,

1167
00:57:48,671 --> 00:57:50,860
which is not an exaggeration that,
you know,

1168
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:54,790
I can't remember the exact number,
but it's extremely high that the average

1169
00:57:54,791 --> 00:57:58,330
number of courses of antibiotics,
they were born by c section.

1170
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:03,780
They eat a crappy diet with a lot of 
processed and refined foods and they're 

1171
00:58:04,151 --> 00:58:05,710
sedentary,
they're not exercising,

1172
00:58:05,711 --> 00:58:10,711
so this person is in really bad shape 
and their immune system seriously 

1173
00:58:10,711 --> 00:58:14,281
dysregulated,
and then when they get exposed to 

1174
00:58:14,281 --> 00:58:17,131
gluten,
which might otherwise be a harmless 

1175
00:58:17,131 --> 00:58:17,440
protein,
it causes problems.

1176
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:22,920
So I think the reason that more people 
are intolerant of gluten and intolerant 

1177
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:27,691
of other foods now is it's not just 
because the foods have changed just 

1178
00:58:27,691 --> 00:58:31,420
because we've changed is because we have
become compromised.

1179
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:32,230
You know,
we should.

1180
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:37,240
Human beings should be resilient and 
able to tolerate these kinds of,

1181
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:38,800
uh,
food proteins.

1182
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:43,890
But when our immune system breaks down,
we talked about the gut as a barrier 

1183
00:58:43,890 --> 00:58:45,940
system where everything that's inside 
the guide is outside the body.

1184
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:51,870
It's important to understand like in 
that the purpose of the gut is to serve 

1185
00:58:52,001 --> 00:58:57,001
as a selective barrier that determines 
what gets in and what stays out.

1186
00:58:58,330 --> 00:59:02,680
Because everything we eat is either 
absorbed or eliminated as waste.

1187
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:07,750
And if that barrier becomes permeable in
a nonselective way,

1188
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:13,080
meaning it loses the ability to make 
appropriate decisions about what gets in

1189
00:59:15,161 --> 00:59:17,230
and out.
Then food proteins,

1190
00:59:17,231 --> 00:59:20,080
they would otherwise be benign and,
and,

1191
00:59:20,110 --> 00:59:22,010
you know,
be broken down into

1192
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:27,010
smaller particles and those small 
particles get absorbed and don't cause 

1193
00:59:27,010 --> 00:59:31,421
any problems.
The larger food proteins get absorbed 

1194
00:59:31,421 --> 00:59:34,811
before they're broken down.
And then that initiates an immune 

1195
00:59:34,811 --> 00:59:35,300
reaction.
That wreaks havoc.

1196
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:39,290
Wow.
So if someone has a healthy gut than the

1197
00:59:39,350 --> 00:59:43,190
insult of some sort of a gluten protein 
being introduced into their,

1198
00:59:43,191 --> 00:59:48,191
god's not going to be as big of a deal 
as if someone is just drinking gatorade 

1199
00:59:48,191 --> 00:59:48,940
all day and eat and cook zygosity.
Uh,

1200
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:51,620
that makes sense is,
it's like any other ecosystem.

1201
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:56,621
So if you think of like an ecosystem 
that's really healthy and you introduce 

1202
00:59:56,621 --> 00:59:59,040
a predator like a predator or you know,
another,

1203
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:04,600
something else that could,
could potentially throw it out of 

1204
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:07,301
balance,
it won't go out of balance because the 

1205
01:00:07,301 --> 01:00:07,340
whole ecosystem is working together to 
keep that in check.

1206
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:09,260
But then,
you know,

1207
01:00:09,261 --> 01:00:13,360
you hear about like the small islands 
where they introduced a particular,

1208
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:18,400
you know,
a predator or prey species that then 

1209
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:19,640
just because the ecosystem of that 
island is fragile,

1210
01:00:19,970 --> 01:00:22,110
you get a huge proliferation,
you know,

1211
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:26,510
where it's just all of a sudden there's 
nothing but deer on the island and until

1212
01:00:26,511 --> 01:00:29,630
they start dying because of that 
imbalance,

1213
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:31,400
you know,
and then it starts all over again.

1214
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:35,090
So I've seen that before.
I've seen that in Hawaii,

1215
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:36,400
on lanai,
right?

1216
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:39,600
They're overrun With a,
an animal called the axis deer.

1217
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:42,500
They're all over the place and for that 
same reason,

1218
01:00:42,790 --> 01:00:45,740
and we have the same phenomenon,
like if we have,

1219
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:51,160
if,
if someone's got microbiome is severely 

1220
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:51,330
disrupted especially.
And that started as a kid,

1221
01:00:51,331 --> 01:00:53,570
then they start,
they developed gluten intolerance,

1222
01:00:53,571 --> 01:00:57,290
they develop and tolerance to corn and 
soy and dairy and allergy.

1223
01:00:57,291 --> 01:01:00,500
This is why allergies are on the rise in
kids is my belief.

1224
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:03,710
It's not because there's some weird,
you know,

1225
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:08,760
all of a sudden someone introduced some 
kind of poison that is causing kids to 

1226
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:11,180
be more allergic.
It's because of immune dysregulation.

1227
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:13,730
And that's happening because of the 
sleep issue,

1228
01:01:13,731 --> 01:01:17,000
the food and all of the other aspects of
the modern lifestyle.

1229
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:22,030
So what's the best approach for someone 
who wants to be healthier if they want 

1230
01:01:22,030 --> 01:01:26,621
to take control of their gut biome,
is it just consuming a lot of very 

1231
01:01:26,621 --> 01:01:26,840
strong probiotic foods?

1232
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:30,620
So the first thing is to just eat real 
food.

1233
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:31,510
I mean,
I,

1234
01:01:31,530 --> 01:01:34,190
I really liked boil it down to that 
three words,

1235
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:39,191
you know,
eat real food and by real I mean not 

1236
01:01:39,191 --> 01:01:39,191
stuff that comes in a bag or a box,
you know,

1237
01:01:39,191 --> 01:01:43,810
the less processed and refined the 
better and that either came out of the 

1238
01:01:43,810 --> 01:01:44,510
ground or lives on the ground.
Right,

1239
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:46,130
exactly.
And you know,

1240
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:48,650
there are a lot of.
We tend to get really,

1241
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:53,830
you know,
I'm worked up about all the differences 

1242
01:01:53,830 --> 01:01:53,830
between,
you know,

1243
01:01:53,830 --> 01:01:55,930
there's [inaudible] you could say eat 
real food and do vegan.

1244
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:59,510
You could say real food and do paleo and
you know that that's all great.

1245
01:01:59,511 --> 01:02:03,680
But I really actually believe that if 
people just ate real food of any kind,

1246
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:06,020
we'd be in a totally different place 
than we are now.

1247
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:10,430
individual health issues would be worked
out in the variations of those dials.

1248
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,890
Exactly.
That's where the fine tweaking comes.

1249
01:02:12,891 --> 01:02:15,660
But we didn't get to this point because,
um,

1250
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:21,280
you know,
everyone's eating real food and 

1251
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:21,280
everyone's doing or everyone's doing 
paleo.

1252
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:24,240
We got to this point because people are 
eating trash essentially.

1253
01:02:24,270 --> 01:02:29,270
So one of the most key things with the 
gut microbiome to understand is that our

1254
01:02:29,581 --> 01:02:34,581
healthy gut bacteria thrive on what are 
called fermentable carbohydrates or 

1255
01:02:34,581 --> 01:02:36,930
justin sonnenburg,
who we talked about before,

1256
01:02:36,931 --> 01:02:39,690
he calls them microbiotic accessible 
carbohydrates.

1257
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:42,180
These are fancy terms that just mean 
fiber.

1258
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:44,830
So what,
what,

1259
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:49,900
what distingUished is fiber is that we 
don't break it down and turn it into 

1260
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:53,961
glucose or you know,
other molecules that we can absorb and 

1261
01:02:53,961 --> 01:02:56,140
use for our own energy.
It stays in the gut to,

1262
01:02:56,700 --> 01:03:01,700
you know,
all the way to the colon and then the 

1263
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:03,741
bacteria eat that fiber.
so fiber is food for our beneficial gut 

1264
01:03:03,741 --> 01:03:05,700
bacteria and that's what makes them 
thrive.

1265
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:08,130
so that's fascinating because most 
people think of fiber,

1266
01:03:08,131 --> 01:03:10,560
they think of it almost as like a,
like a laxative.

1267
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:11,690
Yeah.
Yeah.

1268
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:14,130
I think it was something that's going to
clean out their bowels.

1269
01:03:14,430 --> 01:03:17,610
So not all fiber is fermentable by the 
gut bacteria.

1270
01:03:17,611 --> 01:03:20,280
Some fiber just has that mechanical 
effect.

1271
01:03:20,281 --> 01:03:21,110
It's more like,
you know,

1272
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:25,080
pushing things through the bowels,
whereas other fiber can actually be used

1273
01:03:25,081 --> 01:03:28,370
as food by your gut bacteria.
And that fiber's probably more bats.

1274
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,350
The more beneficial.
So you're talking like sauerkraut,

1275
01:03:31,351 --> 01:03:33,080
kimchi,
those.

1276
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:38,140
Yeah,
there's soLuble fiber that are present 

1277
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:38,140
in a lot of fruits and vegetables.
Um,

1278
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:43,220
you've got a non starch polysaccharides 
like inulin and fos and things like that

1279
01:03:43,501 --> 01:03:45,930
that are in like onions and garlic,
jerusalem,

1280
01:03:45,931 --> 01:03:48,150
artichokes,
leeks,

1281
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:51,660
umm.
And then you've got resistant starch,

1282
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:56,661
which is actually not,
that's in a lot of starchy plants that 

1283
01:03:56,661 --> 01:03:56,661
we used to eat,
you know,

1284
01:03:56,661 --> 01:03:58,590
way back in paleolithic era.

1285
01:03:59,270 --> 01:04:01,890
And some traditional hunter gatherers 
still do,

1286
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:06,920
but a resistant starch these days can be
found in certain types of starches that 

1287
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:11,160
have been cooked and cooled potatoes or 
lentils.

1288
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:16,260
Um,
some people now are supplementing with 

1289
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:17,280
resistance starch or they're eating a,
like green unripe,

1290
01:04:17,281 --> 01:04:19,470
bananas,
unripe plantations,

1291
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:20,670
you know,
what are those?

1292
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:25,740
Are those,
do that because they're unripe it's the 

1293
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:27,570
starches resistant.
As they ripen the starch,

1294
01:04:27,690 --> 01:04:31,140
it becomes just regular starch.
Um,

1295
01:04:31,650 --> 01:04:36,650
so cook those,
like if you wanted to cook a green 

1296
01:04:36,650 --> 01:04:40,541
plantain use,
you can slice them and then dehydrate 

1297
01:04:40,541 --> 01:04:43,011
them and you make them into chips.
You can even buy plantain chips now at 

1298
01:04:43,011 --> 01:04:44,460
some health food stores by plantain 
chips.

1299
01:04:44,461 --> 01:04:46,050
That's what you're getting.
You're getting dehydrated,

1300
01:04:46,051 --> 01:04:49,110
getting some resistant starch there,
uh,

1301
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:52,350
or you can bake a white potato for 
example,

1302
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:55,840
and tHen let it cool.
AnD that cooLing processes what forms of

1303
01:04:55,860 --> 01:04:58,680
resistant starch.
And this is what's really interesting.

1304
01:04:58,681 --> 01:05:03,681
You know,
most people think of potatoes is 

1305
01:05:03,681 --> 01:05:05,361
something that would spike their blood 
sugar because they have a lot of 

1306
01:05:05,361 --> 01:05:06,600
carbohydrate.
But when you cook and cooled a potato,

1307
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:09,720
it won't have that effect because the 
resistance starts,

1308
01:05:09,721 --> 01:05:12,060
you can't absorb and break that into 
glucose.

1309
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:13,500
Whoa.
So,

1310
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:16,350
so when you cool a potato,
it's better for you?

1311
01:05:16,590 --> 01:05:17,830
Yeah.
So there's

1312
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:23,060
like a cold potato salad would actually 
not have the same effect on your blood 

1313
01:05:23,060 --> 01:05:24,850
sugar is eating a warm baked potato that
you just cooked.

1314
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:29,440
In fact.
Crazy.

1315
01:05:29,450 --> 01:05:31,690
Have you heard of the potato?
Heck no.

1316
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:37,380
This is probabLy the most effective diet
that I've ever come across for weight 

1317
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:41,380
loss and this is what I use in my 
practice with patients when nothing else

1318
01:05:41,381 --> 01:05:46,381
has worked or if someone's super 
motivated and just wants to make 

1319
01:05:46,381 --> 01:05:49,621
progress quickly.
A guy named tim steele introduced me to 

1320
01:05:49,621 --> 01:05:54,451
this and it was a.
He has sent me some books that he found 

1321
01:05:54,451 --> 01:05:56,650
in the 1880 [inaudible] that referenced 
this diet.

1322
01:05:56,740 --> 01:06:01,740
So this is oLD schooL and what you do is
you basically eat nothing but potatoes 

1323
01:06:04,450 --> 01:06:06,160
and you,
but you don't.

1324
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:10,090
They're plain potatoes so you can roast 
them or boil them,

1325
01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:11,110
but you don't,
you know,

1326
01:06:11,111 --> 01:06:12,970
in the hardcore,
the hardest core version.

1327
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:17,970
You don't even add salt,
you just plain baked potato or boiled 

1328
01:06:17,970 --> 01:06:20,580
potato.
I'm certainly no butter chives,

1329
01:06:20,581 --> 01:06:22,130
sour cream bacon,
you know,

1330
01:06:22,150 --> 01:06:25,720
because that increases the reward value 
as we were talking about earlier.

1331
01:06:25,930 --> 01:06:29,610
The more variety there is,
the more rewarding of food is okay.

1332
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,010
So,
um,

1333
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:36,600
you just eat potatoes and there are 
different variations or different ways 

1334
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:41,221
of doing it.
You can do it for maybe just three days 

1335
01:06:41,221 --> 01:06:41,221
a week and then you can do your normal 
diet,

1336
01:06:41,221 --> 01:06:42,490
you know,
the other four days a week,

1337
01:06:42,910 --> 01:06:47,910
uh,
tim talks about a variation called 

1338
01:06:47,910 --> 01:06:49,921
potatoes by day,
which means you just eat potatoes for 

1339
01:06:49,921 --> 01:06:50,320
breakfast and for lunch and then you eat
a normal dinner.

1340
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:55,860
But I'm in my clinic and from tim's 
experience working with a lot of people,

1341
01:06:56,620 --> 01:06:59,110
most people will lose an average of a 
half pound a day.

1342
01:07:00,310 --> 01:07:02,420
And I think there are two there,
there,

1343
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:05,080
there are a few things happening here 
and why it works.

1344
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,450
Number one,
uh,

1345
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:12,750
it's,
it's totally playing towards these 

1346
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:12,750
mechanisms that we talked about before.
The,

1347
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:12,850
the,
the reward,

1348
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:17,880
the reward value food,
which is called the key donek system 

1349
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:19,300
that drives our food craving and 
preferences.

1350
01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:20,980
And just,
let's do a thought experiment.

1351
01:07:21,490 --> 01:07:26,490
If you have two plates of food and on 
one plate you have a steamed potato with

1352
01:07:27,221 --> 01:07:32,221
no salt or butter or fat of any kind.
And on this plate on the right you got a

1353
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:35,380
bag of potato chips or just a plate of 
potato chips.

1354
01:07:35,890 --> 01:07:39,700
Which one are you going to eat less of?
I mean it goes without saying,

1355
01:07:39,701 --> 01:07:41,800
right?
You're only going to eat the potato when

1356
01:07:41,801 --> 01:07:46,801
you.
When you're hungry and you're not going 

1357
01:07:46,801 --> 01:07:46,870
to eat probably a bite more than you're 
hungry for.

1358
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:49,450
Whereas the potato chips,
all bets are off.

1359
01:07:49,510 --> 01:07:50,740
Yeah,
for most people.

1360
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:53,680
And so what happens is when you do the 
potato diet,

1361
01:07:53,681 --> 01:07:57,040
you get a spontaneous calorie reduction 
and by spontaneous,

1362
01:07:57,041 --> 01:08:01,090
I mean not voluntary,
you're not setting out to say,

1363
01:08:01,091 --> 01:08:01,830
okay,
I'm only gonna.

1364
01:08:01,850 --> 01:08:06,850
Eat a thousand calories today.
You're saying I'm going to eat as many 

1365
01:08:06,850 --> 01:08:10,130
potatoes as I want to satiate my hunger,
but just by definition,

1366
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:12,550
because of how our brain works,
you're only going to eat.

1367
01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:15,620
You're going to eat less than you would 
typically.

1368
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:19,160
so that's one thing.
You get a reduction in calorie intake.

1369
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:23,480
The second thing is that when the.
When you cook the potato,

1370
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:28,520
most people,
the way they do this diet is they'll 

1371
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:30,761
just cook like you know,
all the potatoes that they need for the 

1372
01:08:30,761 --> 01:08:34,480
week on sunday to make it easy.
So then I have to cook the potato every 

1373
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:38,441
time they sit down to eat,
so they cooked the potatoes and then 

1374
01:08:38,441 --> 01:08:40,520
they let them cool and so then each time
you can still hit them back up,

1375
01:08:41,140 --> 01:08:41,960
um,
but,

1376
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:45,140
but they now have a lot of resistant 
starch.

1377
01:08:45,141 --> 01:08:47,570
Even if you heat them back up,
even if you hit them back up.

1378
01:08:47,571 --> 01:08:52,571
And here's what's really cool about it.
If you heat them up and cooled them 

1379
01:08:52,571 --> 01:08:55,870
again,
each cooling cycle forms more resistant 

1380
01:08:55,870 --> 01:08:56,390
starch so that by the end of the week,
if you've,

1381
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:59,420
if you're heating all the potatoes,
backup and then cooling them again,

1382
01:08:59,421 --> 01:09:03,080
each time you're going to have a potato 
that's mostly resistant starch,

1383
01:09:03,081 --> 01:09:08,081
which means it will have zero impact on 
your blood sugar and it will be like a 

1384
01:09:08,081 --> 01:09:09,740
feast for your beneficial gut 
microbiome.

1385
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,670
And that's another reason this diet 
probably works.

1386
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:14,630
We,
you know,

1387
01:09:14,631 --> 01:09:19,631
all about the studies correlating 
disrupted gut microbiome with obesity 

1388
01:09:19,631 --> 01:09:21,590
and diabetes.
And so you're basically,

1389
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:26,980
the way I tell patients is you,
you're basically going on an all fiber 

1390
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:30,190
diet and you'll eat the skin too.
You can eat the skin usually discussion,

1391
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:30,710
yeah.
Yeah,

1392
01:09:31,130 --> 01:09:36,130
yeah,
skin has vitamins in it so people will 

1393
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:37,100
lose up to a half a pound,
you know,

1394
01:09:37,101 --> 01:09:40,850
between a quarter and a half a pound a 
day that they're on the potato diet.

1395
01:09:40,851 --> 01:09:42,260
It's amazing.
So if you,

1396
01:09:42,290 --> 01:09:43,410
let's say,
you know,

1397
01:09:43,790 --> 01:09:48,790
you decide I want to,
I want to lose one and a half pounds a 

1398
01:09:48,790 --> 01:09:51,821
week.
You do it for three days a week and you 

1399
01:09:51,821 --> 01:09:53,120
do that for six months.
Then by the end of that six month period

1400
01:09:53,121 --> 01:09:54,980
you've lost a pretty significant amount 
of weight.

1401
01:09:55,370 --> 01:09:57,440
If you can keep that up,
keep it up,

1402
01:09:57,470 --> 01:09:58,450
the blend,
the it.

1403
01:09:58,530 --> 01:10:03,530
That's another fascinating aspect about 
diet is like how much of our life we 

1404
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:07,190
were willing to forego health,
happiness,

1405
01:10:07,191 --> 01:10:10,970
all these different things just for some
simple mouth pleasure for a few moments.

1406
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Yeah,
I mean if you think about a pizza that 

1407
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:16,190
you would eat that.
I mean how long you need it for?

1408
01:10:16,191 --> 01:10:21,191
Twenty minutes,
20 minutes out of a 24 hour day and 

1409
01:10:21,191 --> 01:10:21,770
you're going to feel like shit for at 
least an hour or two afterwards.

1410
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:25,010
You know,
if you try to do anything like physical,

1411
01:10:25,340 --> 01:10:30,340
it's going to be more than two hours 
before finally if you really want to go 

1412
01:10:30,340 --> 01:10:31,310
to the gym or you want to go for a run.
Oh,

1413
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:36,520
and look,
I'm not saying I think everyone should 

1414
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:36,520
do this.
I think food should be pleasurable and I

1415
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:36,520
think,
you know,

1416
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:37,730
the way I eat,
for example,

1417
01:10:37,731 --> 01:10:39,620
I love the foods that I,
you know,

1418
01:10:39,621 --> 01:10:41,780
it's um,
but,

1419
01:10:42,010 --> 01:10:45,770
and this is why I say I don't suggest 
that anyone wants to start here,

1420
01:10:45,771 --> 01:10:47,600
but I think it's interesting because it 
gets it.

1421
01:10:47,601 --> 01:10:49,820
Some of what we've already been talking 
about how,

1422
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:55,240
why the modern food environment 
contributes to obesity and how using 

1423
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:58,700
that knowledge and understanding of what
triggers us to eat,

1424
01:10:58,701 --> 01:11:02,090
we can turn that around and use it in 
our favor.

1425
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:07,360
So another strategy that's similar is to
just eat that but not quite as extreme 

1426
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:08,990
as jesus eat the same thing for 
breakfast,

1427
01:11:08,991 --> 01:11:11,510
lunch and dinner for like two or three 
days in a week.

1428
01:11:12,260 --> 01:11:14,520
So you get bored with it that way.
Exactly.

1429
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,790
That seems like all mental tricks,
like someone would tell you,

1430
01:11:17,791 --> 01:11:21,020
like someone like jocko say,
just suck it up and being on there,

1431
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:26,180
it's using our understanding of our,
our biology and our in our behavioral 

1432
01:11:26,551 --> 01:11:31,551
mechanisms to,
to combat the way that the modern food 

1433
01:11:31,801 --> 01:11:34,680
environment is working against us.
What do you think about like pre,

1434
01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:39,870
pre planned meal programs?
Like there's a lot of companies that 

1435
01:11:39,870 --> 01:11:41,310
sell a prepackaged meal delivery 
portioned.

1436
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:43,100
Yeah.
That's not a bad way.

1437
01:11:43,110 --> 01:11:48,110
I think those can play a role too 
because it's kind of a set and forget 

1438
01:11:48,110 --> 01:11:52,100
kind of thing.
And you know what the portion size 

1439
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:52,100
should be.

1440
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:52,100
Um,
there's,

1441
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:55,880
there's another strategy that's very 
simple that's been shown to contribute 

1442
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:55,880
to weight loss and,
and again,

1443
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:57,660
it,
it plays to the same mechanisms which is

1444
01:11:57,661 --> 01:12:00,600
to get smaller plates.
So you know,

1445
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:03,150
a lot you go to target and you buy 
plates like this big,

1446
01:12:03,570 --> 01:12:08,570
right?
If it don't even fit in some of the 

1447
01:12:08,570 --> 01:12:08,570
dishwashers.
Yeah.

1448
01:12:08,570 --> 01:12:11,930
Um,
and we don't even think it's just 

1449
01:12:11,930 --> 01:12:13,920
something you wouldn't even think about,
but we have a tendency to fill that 

1450
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:13,920
plate up.
Yup.

1451
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,170
And just for shooting a smaller plate in
any eating office,

1452
01:12:15,190 --> 01:12:18,480
smaller plates has been shown to have a 
meaningful impact on weight loss.

1453
01:12:18,510 --> 01:12:19,950
Yeah.
Like you ever go to a buffet,

1454
01:12:20,310 --> 01:12:23,790
like when buffet always take some 
obligation to,

1455
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:28,860
to get your money's worth,
just gorge yourself bizarre combinations

1456
01:12:29,611 --> 01:12:32,690
of food that you would never put 
together in any other context.

1457
01:12:33,250 --> 01:12:34,150
but it's all there.

1458
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:36,420
it's variety is a,
it's a real problem.

1459
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:40,140
Some people say is like the antichrist 
for our,

1460
01:12:40,650 --> 01:12:44,160
the way our brain works with food 
because it's variety.

1461
01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:46,800
It's all like highly rewarding,
you know,

1462
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:51,860
palatable foods.
It's like the absolute worst possible 

1463
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:51,860
thing.
But if you think about it,

1464
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:54,510
our entire food environment is,
it's like a buffet.

1465
01:12:55,020 --> 01:13:00,020
You can go into any store at any time 
and get any kind of food to trigger any 

1466
01:13:00,020 --> 01:13:00,860
of those cravings.
Yeah.

1467
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:05,550
Do you supplement with any sort of 
probiotics outside of regular food?

1468
01:13:05,950 --> 01:13:08,640
Um,
I will occasionally take probiotics.

1469
01:13:08,641 --> 01:13:13,641
I mostly try to get it through fermented
foods because I think that's probably.

1470
01:13:14,170 --> 01:13:16,500
What do you choose?
Sauerkraut is a great one.

1471
01:13:16,501 --> 01:13:21,501
Kimchi,
I do find with full fat fermented dairy 

1472
01:13:21,501 --> 01:13:24,951
like kefir or yogurt,
sometimes we make our own yogurt for a 

1473
01:13:24,951 --> 01:13:28,200
minute longer so it has more microbes 
beat covas is a lesser known.

1474
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:31,110
It's a beverage comes from Russia in 
that area.

1475
01:13:31,111 --> 01:13:34,380
It's fermented beets and made into a 
juice gust.

1476
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:34,810
No,
you,

1477
01:13:34,950 --> 01:13:36,580
if you'd like some of these other 
ferments,

1478
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:37,890
I think you'd like it.
No,

1479
01:13:37,891 --> 01:13:40,530
I'm just joking around.
I like kimchi and most people think it's

1480
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:41,670
file.
yeah.

1481
01:13:41,790 --> 01:13:46,790
Everyone in my house thinks it's vile.
Now the beak of us is good and it's 

1482
01:13:46,790 --> 01:13:50,030
beats are super nutrient dense so.
And the fermentation brings out even 

1483
01:13:50,030 --> 01:13:51,620
more nutrients.
So it's like a super food beverage.

1484
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:53,940
Fermentation brings more nutrients.
Interesting.

1485
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:54,840
Yeah.
In what way?

1486
01:13:54,841 --> 01:13:56,730
What did it makes them more 
bioavailable?

1487
01:13:56,910 --> 01:13:57,810
Really?
Yeah.

1488
01:13:58,140 --> 01:13:58,970
What are,
what,

1489
01:13:59,030 --> 01:14:01,980
what nutrients does a fermenting?
Well,

1490
01:14:01,981 --> 01:14:02,490
uh,
from,

1491
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:05,940
from fermenting creates a vitamin k for 
example.

1492
01:14:05,970 --> 01:14:09,240
So fermented foods are wanting the best 
source of vitamin k two,

1493
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:14,360
and that's why a natto,
which is fermented soybean product from 

1494
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:14,680
Japan is the highest,
you know,

1495
01:14:14,681 --> 01:14:17,380
pound for pound,
ounce for ounce is the highest source of

1496
01:14:17,381 --> 01:14:18,160
vitamin k two.

1497
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:23,160
There is that we know of,
but cheese is another high source of k 

1498
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:24,710
two and that's because it's fermented.
Um,

1499
01:14:24,820 --> 01:14:29,140
so most fermented foods have vitamin k 
sit in beer or wine or any of the other.

1500
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:32,270
I don't think so too bad.
Yeah.

1501
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:33,440
Too bad.
Um,

1502
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:35,410
so kimchi,
sauerkraut,

1503
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:39,820
neto,
this beat stuff eat yogurt,

1504
01:14:40,030 --> 01:14:45,030
yogurt or a kefir,
which is like a liquid form of yogurt.

1505
01:14:45,340 --> 01:14:49,870
Um,
there are a kids kiss a certain kinds of

1506
01:14:49,871 --> 01:14:54,871
cheese.
Cheese doesn't tend to be as beneficial 

1507
01:14:54,871 --> 01:14:54,871
in terms of the amount of microbes that 
are in.

1508
01:14:54,871 --> 01:14:55,470
It will come up.
Gucci,

1509
01:14:55,780 --> 01:14:56,650
kombucha,
I love that.

1510
01:14:57,580 --> 01:14:59,680
And there's lots of different kinds of 
kombucha.

1511
01:14:59,681 --> 01:15:03,280
There's also water kefir,
which is like dairy kefir,

1512
01:15:03,281 --> 01:15:03,840
but it's,
it's,

1513
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:06,100
it's more like kombucha,
but it's used,

1514
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:11,220
uh,
they used the kefir cultures to make it 

1515
01:15:11,220 --> 01:15:14,150
a.
Every traditional culture almost has a 

1516
01:15:14,150 --> 01:15:16,580
fermented food to it because our 
ancestors understood even without 

1517
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:17,680
knowing the science that they were 
beneficial.

1518
01:15:17,950 --> 01:15:18,580
How bizarre.
Well,

1519
01:15:18,581 --> 01:15:23,581
yeah,
they must've just trial and error right 

1520
01:15:23,581 --> 01:15:26,850
now outside of that,
like what's a normal day in chris's 

1521
01:15:26,850 --> 01:15:28,150
life?
Like as far as like your diet,

1522
01:15:28,180 --> 01:15:33,180
like what do you,
do you consume basically the same foods 

1523
01:15:33,180 --> 01:15:33,430
all the time or do you mix it up?
Mix it up quite a bit.

1524
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:38,530
Um,
lately I've been experimenting a lot 

1525
01:15:38,530 --> 01:15:40,501
with quito and ketogenetic diet fasting.
I'm really interested in fasting right 

1526
01:15:41,381 --> 01:15:42,700
now.
Um,

1527
01:15:42,730 --> 01:15:46,940
so like I haven't eaten yet today.
I just had coffee and some,

1528
01:15:47,190 --> 01:15:48,880
some cream,
which I do again,

1529
01:15:48,881 --> 01:15:52,000
I do find with full fat dairy,
I always do that lately.

1530
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:57,540
I'm not always,
but I'm doing that a good solid four to 

1531
01:15:57,540 --> 01:15:58,840
five days a week where I'm doing 
intermittent fasting.

1532
01:15:58,841 --> 01:16:00,100
About 14 hours.
Yeah.

1533
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:01,790
I feel great when I do and I,
I,

1534
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:07,000
I love it.
I like the mental clarity and focus and 

1535
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,410
to be honest,
it's actually.

1536
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:10,630
I mean I love food preparation.
I like to cook,

1537
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:13,360
but it's nice to be able to have a break
from that,

1538
01:16:13,410 --> 01:16:14,050
you know,
not to,

1539
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:17,290
not to worry about what I'm going to eat
and cleaning up and all that stuff.

1540
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:19,630
And uh,
so,

1541
01:16:19,850 --> 01:16:24,850
you know,
these days my average day is kind of 

1542
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:27,721
like no breakfast fasting.
Then I might have a wet mark,

1543
01:16:28,661 --> 01:16:32,290
sisson calls a fat bomb salad for lunch 
if you know,

1544
01:16:32,291 --> 01:16:34,240
if I have lunch,
I might have a later lunch.

1545
01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:39,750
Um,
so that would be like a salad with a 

1546
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:39,750
little bit of protein,
chicken,

1547
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:39,750
fish,
et cetera.

1548
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:42,400
And then like avocado and olives and you
know,

1549
01:16:42,430 --> 01:16:46,090
really good healthy fats.
And then,

1550
01:16:46,180 --> 01:16:49,120
um,
if I'm not doing a key to genic phase,

1551
01:16:49,121 --> 01:16:52,660
I'll have a normal dinner which would 
look like a portion of protein,

1552
01:16:52,870 --> 01:16:57,870
lots of non starchy vegetable and like a
sweet potato or a plantation or uh,

1553
01:16:58,470 --> 01:17:03,470
uh,
some taro root or one of these paleo 

1554
01:17:03,470 --> 01:17:05,190
friendly type of starches.
And if you were going quito,

1555
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:07,120
how would you switch it up?
Then?

1556
01:17:07,150 --> 01:17:10,790
I would typically have the protein,
the non starchy vegetables,

1557
01:17:10,791 --> 01:17:13,670
and either like some zucchini noodles or
turnip noodles.

1558
01:17:13,671 --> 01:17:18,671
You can get like a spiralizer and make 
the noodles really easily and I would 

1559
01:17:18,671 --> 01:17:19,490
put some additional fat on those,
those,

1560
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:20,540
you know,

1561
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:24,860
vegetable noodles or I might just have 
another non starchy vegetable along with

1562
01:17:24,861 --> 01:17:28,130
fat or a salad on top of.
You're essentially just manipulating the

1563
01:17:28,131 --> 01:17:29,840
fat levels.
other than that,

1564
01:17:29,841 --> 01:17:32,120
you're eating primarily the same type of
foods.

1565
01:17:32,390 --> 01:17:37,390
He just,
you're manipulating the fat versus 

1566
01:17:37,390 --> 01:17:37,390
carbohydrate levels.
And how do you feel?

1567
01:17:37,770 --> 01:17:42,770
What do you find it difficult to 
maintain the ketogenic diet and how do 

1568
01:17:42,770 --> 01:17:44,180
you feel when you're on it versus when 
you're not?

1569
01:17:44,210 --> 01:17:44,570
Yeah,

1570
01:17:44,570 --> 01:17:49,570
so for me,
because I'm leanne obviously the,

1571
01:17:50,270 --> 01:17:55,130
and I have a fast metabolism.
I can do quito for a couple of weeks and

1572
01:17:55,131 --> 01:18:00,131
feel pretty good.
I've done it for as long as three 

1573
01:18:00,131 --> 01:18:00,131
months.
Um,

1574
01:18:00,131 --> 01:18:04,130
so I've done the full experiment and 
what happens is after about two or three

1575
01:18:04,131 --> 01:18:09,131
weeks,
my exercise tolerance and recovery 

1576
01:18:09,131 --> 01:18:11,321
starts to go down.
So I start to Have less capacity to Do 

1577
01:18:11,321 --> 01:18:14,150
Like more glycolytic activities,
explosive movements,

1578
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:16,090
weightlifting,
um,

1579
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:20,750
even or sprinting,
high intensity types of training.

1580
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:22,970
And um,
and,

1581
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:27,980
and I start,
my sleep starts actually deteriorate a 

1582
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:27,980
little bit.
That's one of the biggest things.

1583
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:30,110
So why would it be beneficial then?
What's beneficial about it?

1584
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,700
Well,
I think so too.

1585
01:18:32,780 --> 01:18:34,010
Two things.
Number one,

1586
01:18:34,070 --> 01:18:39,070
not everybody has that response.
A lot of people just feel better and If 

1587
01:18:39,070 --> 01:18:43,360
they're able to do it for a sustained 
period of time and they don't have that 

1588
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:43,360
problem.

1589
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:43,970
Number two,
I,

1590
01:18:44,130 --> 01:18:49,130
the way I'm trying to do it is kind of 
replicating what I think was a typical 

1591
01:18:49,311 --> 01:18:51,110
in the ancestral environment.
So,

1592
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:52,800
um,
it,

1593
01:18:52,890 --> 01:18:57,890
most hunter gatherer cultures that we've
studied a would have naturally had 

1594
01:18:57,890 --> 01:19:00,770
periods of food scarcity,
so they're not always starving,

1595
01:19:00,890 --> 01:19:05,890
but because they don't have a set with a
live and on the corner or costco or 

1596
01:19:05,890 --> 01:19:09,371
whatever,
they would have periods where they 

1597
01:19:09,371 --> 01:19:09,371
weren't successful in a hunt.
So,

1598
01:19:09,371 --> 01:19:10,160
you know,
they would go without eating or they eat

1599
01:19:10,161 --> 01:19:12,520
less.
That's just built into our,

1600
01:19:12,730 --> 01:19:15,470
our template I think.
And so I've,

1601
01:19:15,530 --> 01:19:17,030
I do a thing where I'm,
you know,

1602
01:19:17,031 --> 01:19:22,031
I'll do intermittent fasting for a 
period and I might do a week or two of 

1603
01:19:22,031 --> 01:19:25,241
ketosis and then I might just eat my 
normal diet for six weeks or two months 

1604
01:19:25,241 --> 01:19:30,041
after that.
And then I might do another week of 

1605
01:19:30,041 --> 01:19:30,041
ketosis and I don't schedule it,
I don't plan it,

1606
01:19:30,041 --> 01:19:31,860
I just let my body tell me,
you know,

1607
01:19:31,940 --> 01:19:34,760
oh,
kind of feels like all I want to do that

1608
01:19:34,761 --> 01:19:35,150
now.

1609
01:19:35,210 --> 01:19:38,050
And are you doing blood tests?
are you doing breath tests?

1610
01:19:38,051 --> 01:19:40,400
How you monitoring your ketones?
I totally,

1611
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:45,520
uh,
so I have the blood ketone monitor and 

1612
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:47,030
I'm from all the research that I've seen
at this point.

1613
01:19:47,031 --> 01:19:51,680
Breath ketone testing is not accurate at
higher levels of ketosis.

1614
01:19:51,710 --> 01:19:56,710
It's accurate at lower levels,
but when you get into the therapeutic 

1615
01:19:56,710 --> 01:19:56,710
range around two point.
Oh,

1616
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:58,220
one point five to two point.
Oh,

1617
01:19:58,221 --> 01:20:02,270
which is kind of the sweet spot for me 
than blood ketones are more accurate.

1618
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:06,440
And the problem with the blood ketone 
strips are super expensive,

1619
01:20:06,441 --> 01:20:09,900
especially if you buy them just like at 
the drug store or something like that.

1620
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:12,030
Um,
but,

1621
01:20:12,270 --> 01:20:12,970
uh,
I,

1622
01:20:12,990 --> 01:20:14,970
if you,
you can look around and try to find them

1623
01:20:14,971 --> 01:20:16,990
in bulk and they,
they're cheaper that way and,

1624
01:20:16,991 --> 01:20:21,991
and frankly at this point,
and I think that's true for most people 

1625
01:20:21,991 --> 01:20:21,991
once you get used to it,
you know,

1626
01:20:21,991 --> 01:20:26,721
and you've done it enough,
you don't need to keep using them over 

1627
01:20:26,721 --> 01:20:29,331
and over,
you just kind of know when you're going 

1628
01:20:29,331 --> 01:20:29,331
to be in ketosis when you're not.

1629
01:20:29,331 --> 01:20:31,680
And I've tracked my,
my values and I've tracked,

1630
01:20:31,710 --> 01:20:36,710
you know,
I've treated hundreds of patients where 

1631
01:20:36,710 --> 01:20:38,301
we've done these kinds of experiments 
and this goes back to the discussion 

1632
01:20:38,301 --> 01:20:39,450
about ldl.
So for me on a,

1633
01:20:39,630 --> 01:20:41,580
on a ketogenic diet,
you know,

1634
01:20:41,610 --> 01:20:46,610
if I measure my on my typical diet,
my ldl particle number is about $1,200.

1635
01:20:46,830 --> 01:20:50,310
So I'll just briefly describe what that 
is because I think some people might not

1636
01:20:50,311 --> 01:20:53,970
be familiar with that.
So if you imagine that your,

1637
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,120
your blood,
your blood stream is like a highway.

1638
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:03,080
The cars on the highway or the ldl 
particles and the passengers in the car 

1639
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:06,690
or the cholesterol that are carried by 
the ldl particles.

1640
01:21:06,691 --> 01:21:10,370
So for years we've measured the,
the passengers,

1641
01:21:10,390 --> 01:21:15,390
the cholesterol inside of the particle,
and now most of the research suggests 

1642
01:21:15,390 --> 01:21:19,341
that it's actually the number of 
particles or cars on the road that is 

1643
01:21:19,341 --> 01:21:20,670
the biggest driver of heart disease 
risks,

1644
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:22,950
not the amount of cholesterol inside of 
them.

1645
01:21:23,790 --> 01:21:27,120
So you can measure this,
their labcorp and quest,

1646
01:21:27,121 --> 01:21:30,360
they all have a test panel called an 
nmr,

1647
01:21:30,740 --> 01:21:35,740
um,
where you can measure the number of 

1648
01:21:35,740 --> 01:21:37,221
particles that you have.
And so my normal diet is around 11 or 

1649
01:21:37,221 --> 01:21:41,010
$1,200,
which is technically it's high normal or

1650
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:42,810
you know,
in a kind of intermediate range.

1651
01:21:42,811 --> 01:21:45,380
I'm noT worried about that level.
Um,

1652
01:21:45,990 --> 01:21:49,320
but when I go to quito,
my ldl goes above 2000,

1653
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:54,150
which is in the 99th percentile and,
and high high risk range.

1654
01:21:54,410 --> 01:21:59,410
Wow.
So this is where I was talking before 

1655
01:21:59,410 --> 01:22:02,361
about getting to a point where we can be
maybe a little more personalized in 

1656
01:22:02,361 --> 01:22:04,590
terms of the recommendations that we 
make because not everyone who goes quito

1657
01:22:04,591 --> 01:22:05,980
experiences that,
you know,

1658
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,640
some people do and some people don't.
What do you think that is?

1659
01:22:09,690 --> 01:22:11,320
Oh,
it's just the one that,

1660
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:12,600
you know,
for me,

1661
01:22:12,690 --> 01:22:15,500
the quito type of diet,
um,

1662
01:22:15,770 --> 01:22:20,770
it,
it affects my liquids in that way and 

1663
01:22:20,770 --> 01:22:24,490
know this is a much larger conversation 
around does that actually increase my 

1664
01:22:24,490 --> 01:22:25,290
risk of heart disease?

1665
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:26,430
Again,
I said before,

1666
01:22:26,431 --> 01:22:30,090
we know that higher ldl on average in 
the general population does,

1667
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:35,120
but if,
if like let's say I have a doppelganger 

1668
01:22:35,310 --> 01:22:40,310
know genetically identical to me in 
everywhere identical twin and that one 

1669
01:22:40,310 --> 01:22:42,990
is not eating healthy,
not exercising,

1670
01:22:43,470 --> 01:22:48,470
not sleeping,
not doing anything to take care of 

1671
01:22:48,470 --> 01:22:52,161
himself,
and he has an ldl p that's high and I 

1672
01:22:52,161 --> 01:22:54,270
have the ldl p that's high and they're 
exactly the same.

1673
01:22:54,660 --> 01:22:59,660
Do we think that we're going to be at 
the same risk of heart disease just 

1674
01:22:59,660 --> 01:23:00,510
because that one number on the paper is 
exactly the same?

1675
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:05,280
That's the assumption that's made in 
conventional research literature.

1676
01:23:05,410 --> 01:23:10,410
Right?
But I think almost anybody just common 

1677
01:23:10,410 --> 01:23:10,410
sense would say,
no,

1678
01:23:10,410 --> 01:23:13,921
that's not true.
There are many other factors that 

1679
01:23:13,921 --> 01:23:15,820
determine the risk of heart disease.
So getting back to this thing.

1680
01:23:15,821 --> 01:23:19,060
So for me with quito,
one of the reasons,

1681
01:23:19,730 --> 01:23:24,730
I mean the main reason I don't do it 
ongoing is I don't feel well when I keep

1682
01:23:25,151 --> 01:23:25,540
doing it.

1683
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:27,010
Like I said,
number two,

1684
01:23:27,070 --> 01:23:30,670
I don't like doing it long term and I 
think that's important.

1685
01:23:30,671 --> 01:23:35,671
And number number three,
I don't necessarily want to have an ldl 

1686
01:23:35,671 --> 01:23:36,730
p of 2000,
but you do think there are some benefits

1687
01:23:36,731 --> 01:23:41,731
to occasionally doing.
I think that it was very natural for 

1688
01:23:41,731 --> 01:23:43,600
human beings to be in ketosis at least 
part of the time.

1689
01:23:43,780 --> 01:23:46,570
And whether you enter into that by just 
fasting,

1690
01:23:47,430 --> 01:23:52,430
um,
or whether you do it with a ketogenic 

1691
01:23:52,430 --> 01:23:52,430
diet,
I don't know that that really matters.

1692
01:23:52,430 --> 01:23:56,731
I mean,
fasting has some additional benefits 

1693
01:23:56,731 --> 01:23:58,621
above and beyond just ketosis,
like autophagy which is a cellular 

1694
01:23:58,621 --> 01:24:01,510
cleanup and repair process that happens 
in a fasted state.

1695
01:24:02,110 --> 01:24:03,910
Um,
if you think about it,

1696
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:09,310
if fasting or being in a fasted state 
was a normal part of human evolution,

1697
01:24:09,370 --> 01:24:13,210
it makes sense that certain processes 
would only happen in that fasted state.

1698
01:24:13,870 --> 01:24:18,870
It does make sense.
But I would feel like when I'm talking 

1699
01:24:18,870 --> 01:24:21,601
to you based on your experience,
I would avoid being in ketosis all 

1700
01:24:21,601 --> 01:24:22,480
together because it sounds like it sucks
for,

1701
01:24:22,481 --> 01:24:24,080
you know,
it doesn't.

1702
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:26,620
Those first two weeks are really great 
and feel great.

1703
01:24:26,621 --> 01:24:31,621
Yeah.
And then it starts to shift over to dom 

1704
01:24:31,621 --> 01:24:32,760
d'agostino said that there's like a uh,
so there's a,

1705
01:24:32,790 --> 01:24:34,480
an adaptation period.
Yeah.

1706
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:37,870
Usually three weeks is the full period 
for most people.

1707
01:24:37,871 --> 01:24:39,250
But like I said,
I've done a full,

1708
01:24:39,310 --> 01:24:40,960
you know,
longer experiments.

1709
01:24:40,961 --> 01:24:44,050
So I know it wasn't just a question of 
me not being fat adapted.

1710
01:24:44,170 --> 01:24:49,170
I think he was talking about several 
months in terms of like athletic 

1711
01:24:49,170 --> 01:24:49,170
performance when you were performance 
starts to.

1712
01:24:49,450 --> 01:24:51,700
Yeah,
I think that varies a lot from person to

1713
01:24:51,701 --> 01:24:56,701
person.
Also varies how quickly someone can get 

1714
01:24:56,701 --> 01:24:57,310
into and out of ketosis.
I go into it very quickly.

1715
01:24:57,310 --> 01:24:59,590
For me,
just the second,

1716
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:03,910
if I do one day of fasting or one day of
quito on the second day,

1717
01:25:03,911 --> 01:25:06,100
I'll generally be at one,
one point two,

1718
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:08,770
which most people say is in a 
therapeutic range.

1719
01:25:08,771 --> 01:25:13,771
And then by the third or fourth day I'll
usually be at two without a lot of 

1720
01:25:13,771 --> 01:25:17,071
effort and deregulate your protein 
intake when you're doing a ketogenic 

1721
01:25:17,071 --> 01:25:18,340
diet as well to avoid the protein 
converting.

1722
01:25:18,790 --> 01:25:20,350
Again,
that's highly individual.

1723
01:25:20,351 --> 01:25:21,580
From what I've seen.
For me,

1724
01:25:21,820 --> 01:25:24,640
protein doesn't seem to be that 
significant of a lever.

1725
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:26,110
I've tried,
you know,

1726
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:31,200
I did an experiment where I was just 
fasting in the morning so I had no 

1727
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:34,300
protein and then I would have three 
ounces of protein only with the salad at

1728
01:25:34,301 --> 01:25:37,660
lunch and then I would have kind of 
normal sized portion of protein.

1729
01:25:37,661 --> 01:25:41,380
So that's actually pretty low protein 
for someone of my size.

1730
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:43,270
Um,
and that.

1731
01:25:43,271 --> 01:25:48,271
And then I've done it where I've just 
done quito where I've had protein for 

1732
01:25:48,271 --> 01:25:48,271
breakfast,
lunch and dinner.

1733
01:25:48,271 --> 01:25:49,810
It doesn't seem to make a big difference
for me,

1734
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:55,020
but I have patients for whom that's a,
that's actually as big of a leverage 

1735
01:25:55,020 --> 01:25:55,060
carbohydrate.
And you know,

1736
01:25:55,090 --> 01:26:00,090
I had tom bill you on the podcast and he
was one of the founders of quest 

1737
01:26:00,090 --> 01:26:03,220
nutrition and he said one of those quest
bars would knock them out of ketosis.

1738
01:26:03,420 --> 01:26:04,880
But just because of the amount of 
protein,

1739
01:26:04,881 --> 01:26:05,750
I'm like,
that's crazy.

1740
01:26:05,770 --> 01:26:07,790
Yeah.
And I think they're only like,

1741
01:26:07,791 --> 01:26:08,690
um,
what is it,

1742
01:26:08,691 --> 01:26:10,940
like 18 grams or something,
somewhere in the range.

1743
01:26:10,970 --> 01:26:15,970
That's why it's a,
that's why it's so important for us to 

1744
01:26:15,970 --> 01:26:16,820
get over this idea that there's one 
approach that will work for everyone.

1745
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:18,080
It's just stupid.
I know.

1746
01:26:18,081 --> 01:26:23,081
You know robb wolf,
have you ever seen robb wolf's 

1747
01:26:23,081 --> 01:26:23,081
experience that he does on his instagram
and his wife?

1748
01:26:23,081 --> 01:26:25,080
They both eat the same thiNgs,
a totally different,

1749
01:26:25,130 --> 01:26:30,130
totally different results as far as 
their blood sugar and his wife 

1750
01:26:30,130 --> 01:26:30,470
metabolizes things far quicker than he 
does.

1751
01:26:30,950 --> 01:26:35,950
It's really interesting.
That's really interesting because you 

1752
01:26:35,950 --> 01:26:38,640
seem to people that lived together that 
they're eating the exact same foods.

1753
01:26:38,740 --> 01:26:40,190
Yeah.
And uh,

1754
01:26:40,610 --> 01:26:43,670
and you know,
That he's so fascinated by it himself.

1755
01:26:43,671 --> 01:26:45,710
It makes an interesting too.
I mean it's,

1756
01:26:45,770 --> 01:26:47,510
it's so,
um,

1757
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:52,660
it's so necessary for us to take that 
step because you see so much like,

1758
01:26:52,750 --> 01:26:57,750
you know,
wasted energy in my opinion of people 

1759
01:26:57,750 --> 01:26:58,850
arguing back and forth.
And it's often based on like,

1760
01:26:59,210 --> 01:27:01,790
you know,
joe blow goes on a low carb diet.

1761
01:27:01,791 --> 01:27:06,791
has a life changing experience and 
becomes like a almost religious zealot 

1762
01:27:06,860 --> 01:27:11,860
for the low carb lifestyle and assumes 
that because it had that effect on him 

1763
01:27:12,291 --> 01:27:14,880
that it's going to have that effect on 
everybody else and,

1764
01:27:14,940 --> 01:27:18,320
and just starts proselytizing for low 
car.

1765
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:21,830
Yes.
Not recognizing that for someone else.

1766
01:27:21,831 --> 01:27:25,340
For example,
many of my female patients gone low carb

1767
01:27:25,341 --> 01:27:26,440
and,
and if,

1768
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:28,240
if they're like,
you know,

1769
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:32,420
working and taking care of kids and 
doing crossfit several times a week,

1770
01:27:32,421 --> 01:27:35,220
you know,
that could be a disaster for them really

1771
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:36,560
might not work.
And so,

1772
01:27:36,980 --> 01:27:37,930
um,
you know,

1773
01:27:37,940 --> 01:27:39,860
we just gotta we gotta take the next 
step.

1774
01:27:40,050 --> 01:27:45,050
Yeah,
you have to take into account by a 

1775
01:27:45,050 --> 01:27:45,050
diversity.
But uh,

1776
01:27:45,050 --> 01:27:47,370
there's a lot of people that dismiss 
ketogenic diets because that's not what 

1777
01:27:47,370 --> 01:27:48,230
they've been promoting.
That's a,

1778
01:27:48,231 --> 01:27:53,231
that's an issue as well.
Like you've gotta be real careful about 

1779
01:27:53,231 --> 01:27:56,321
someone who's not citing actual science 
when they're talking and dismissing the 

1780
01:27:56,321 --> 01:27:57,830
ketogenic diet.
Like I read someone talking,

1781
01:27:57,831 --> 01:28:02,831
saying that it was a fad and it's hard 
to get into ketosis that it rarely 

1782
01:28:02,831 --> 01:28:02,831
happens.
I'm like,

1783
01:28:02,831 --> 01:28:03,890
well,
that's just not true.

1784
01:28:04,310 --> 01:28:06,320
That's actually factually wrong.
Yeah,

1785
01:28:06,321 --> 01:28:09,020
it's not hard at all and it happens all 
the time and I've been in it,

1786
01:28:09,110 --> 01:28:11,390
I've done it many times.
I'm not in it right now,

1787
01:28:11,391 --> 01:28:15,860
but I do the same thing.
But for me it's a set of boredom.

1788
01:28:16,130 --> 01:28:21,130
Yeah,
I get bored and I want a peanut butter 

1789
01:28:21,130 --> 01:28:21,130
and jelly sandwich or something and then
boom,

1790
01:28:21,130 --> 01:28:21,130
I'm out.
Yeah.

1791
01:28:21,130 --> 01:28:21,410
Well again,
I think that's,

1792
01:28:21,700 --> 01:28:26,240
that's probably closer to the ancestral 
pattern of not being in a continually,

1793
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:27,320
um,
but you know,

1794
01:28:27,650 --> 01:28:29,660
there are some people who need to be in 
it continually,

1795
01:28:29,661 --> 01:28:34,661
like a ketosis can be a life changing a 
intervention for a kid with epilepsy for

1796
01:28:34,971 --> 01:28:38,600
example.
And those kids benefit from being a deep

1797
01:28:38,601 --> 01:28:43,601
ketosis.
So they might actually even need 

1798
01:28:43,601 --> 01:28:43,670
exogenous ketones on top of the key to 
genic diet,

1799
01:28:44,270 --> 01:28:46,070
but they can go from having,
you know,

1800
01:28:46,190 --> 01:28:51,190
40 seizures in a day or being on like 
just brutal antiseizure meds which are 

1801
01:28:51,591 --> 01:28:56,591
horrible for kids.
I mean the side effects are so bad to 

1802
01:28:56,591 --> 01:29:00,461
being completely off medication.
We can ketogenetic diet and so for them 

1803
01:29:00,461 --> 01:29:03,940
that peanut butter,
they're not gonna have that sandwich 

1804
01:29:03,940 --> 01:29:03,940
because it's going to cause

1805
01:29:03,940 --> 01:29:05,490
a seizure.
What was unique in my experience was the

1806
01:29:05,491 --> 01:29:07,080
cognitive benefits.
I was like,

1807
01:29:07,081 --> 01:29:12,081
this is really fascinating because I 
felt so much more clearheaded and from 

1808
01:29:12,081 --> 01:29:16,850
the fog of refined carbohydrates,
but I think that that is a.

1809
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:23,420
I don't know if it's the same or very 
close if I just follow a low carb diet,

1810
01:29:25,170 --> 01:29:30,170
not necessarily ketogenic,
but eliminate refined carbohydrates but 

1811
01:29:30,170 --> 01:29:32,670
don't eliminate salads or fruit or 
things along those lines.

1812
01:29:32,671 --> 01:29:34,440
Like if I want a pair,
eat a pear,

1813
01:29:34,470 --> 01:29:38,910
you know what I mean?
But the very strict application of it.

1814
01:29:39,180 --> 01:29:44,180
One of the first immediate things that I
recognize is that my hunger is a very 

1815
01:29:44,180 --> 01:29:45,870
different thing when I'm hungry,
it's not that big a deal.

1816
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:49,920
WhereAs when I was eating a large amount
of refined carbohydrates,

1817
01:29:49,921 --> 01:29:51,430
the hunger was ferocious.
Yeah,

1818
01:29:51,850 --> 01:29:53,060
yeah.
It was almost like,

1819
01:29:53,140 --> 01:29:57,210
like overwhelmed,
like drums playing in the background

1820
01:29:57,260 --> 01:30:00,350
and that's the ketones because the brain
can utilize.

1821
01:30:00,351 --> 01:30:05,351
Ketones may even prefer key to glucose,
and so when you're producing those 

1822
01:30:05,351 --> 01:30:09,551
ketones,
it really does take the edge off of 

1823
01:30:09,551 --> 01:30:10,220
hunger and it also fuels

1824
01:30:10,360 --> 01:30:12,340
brain in an odd way.
I mean,

1825
01:30:12,341 --> 01:30:16,090
I find that before I do difficult tasks,
mental tasks,

1826
01:30:16,540 --> 01:30:19,180
I like to drink exogenous ketones,
ketones,

1827
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:21,490
I like to take them.
I think you're actually like it though.

1828
01:30:21,640 --> 01:30:22,190
Yeah,
I do.

1829
01:30:22,230 --> 01:30:23,890
I don't mind.
Yeah.

1830
01:30:24,550 --> 01:30:25,880
What does that stuff,
janice?

1831
01:30:26,130 --> 01:30:29,200
Oh yeah.
I liked them the best.

1832
01:30:29,260 --> 01:30:31,540
It doesn't taste bad at all.
I drink it before I work out.

1833
01:30:32,380 --> 01:30:33,690
I like those.
Yeah.

1834
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:35,200
I don't think they're bad.
Yeah.

1835
01:30:35,650 --> 01:30:37,470
You know,
and I throw some alpha brain in there.

1836
01:30:37,471 --> 01:30:39,310
I just shake it up and it actually 
tastes pretty good.

1837
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:40,690
Yeah.
Yeah.

1838
01:30:40,691 --> 01:30:45,691
I think there's definitely a role for,
for the ketogenic diet and for ketosis 

1839
01:30:45,691 --> 01:30:46,930
in general and you know,
fasting,

1840
01:30:46,931 --> 01:30:51,931
as I mentioned before,
had some really interesting benefits 

1841
01:30:51,931 --> 01:30:55,201
above and beyond ketosis that I've been 
exploring a lot might work with 

1842
01:30:55,201 --> 01:30:55,410
patients.
Um,

1843
01:30:56,290 --> 01:30:58,270
have you heard of the fasting mimicking 
diet?

1844
01:30:58,450 --> 01:31:00,070
No.
Doctor valter longo.

1845
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:01,310
so,
uh,

1846
01:31:01,420 --> 01:31:06,420
dr longo was at usc center for longevity
superstar scientist and he basically 

1847
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:12,650
came up with this approach to get,
you know,

1848
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:16,600
the idea was to get the benefits of 
fasting without doing a full water fast.

1849
01:31:16,690 --> 01:31:20,770
And so it's a reduced calorie diet for 
three that's done for three to five days

1850
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:25,920
with specific macronutrient ratios.
And he's done some really interesting 

1851
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:27,000
research.
Most of it is an animal,

1852
01:31:27,001 --> 01:31:27,970
so you have to,
you know,

1853
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,890
take that with a little bit of a grain 
of salt.

1854
01:31:29,891 --> 01:31:31,930
But there has been some in humans as 
well.

1855
01:31:32,590 --> 01:31:35,110
And it's shown things like in animals 
with nms,

1856
01:31:35,350 --> 01:31:40,350
just doing this,
fasting mimicking diet has lead to 

1857
01:31:40,350 --> 01:31:43,960
regeneration of the myelin sheath and 
which is what breaks down in ms,

1858
01:31:43,961 --> 01:31:45,850
which is just,
you just don't see that,

1859
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:47,050
you know,
no animals got,

1860
01:31:47,140 --> 01:31:52,140
there's no dre will they have animal 
models of ms where they created an ms 

1861
01:31:52,211 --> 01:31:54,520
light condition in the animal in order 
to study it.

1862
01:31:55,060 --> 01:31:56,370
Um,
and they show,

1863
01:31:56,380 --> 01:31:58,620
they've shown changes in the brain.
You know,

1864
01:31:58,630 --> 01:32:00,730
we're actually that read growing.
And,

1865
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:02,710
and the reason for this,
this,

1866
01:32:02,770 --> 01:32:07,770
it's thought is that this fasting can 
promote stem cell regeneration so you 

1867
01:32:08,171 --> 01:32:13,171
can actually through fasting,
rebuild certain parts of your body 

1868
01:32:13,171 --> 01:32:14,380
according to this research.
So,

1869
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:16,420
uh,
and then there was the autophagy which I

1870
01:32:16,421 --> 01:32:21,421
mentioned before which is like almost,
you can think of it as like a cellular 

1871
01:32:21,421 --> 01:32:23,590
recycling or clean up or repair process 
that happens in that fast at state.

1872
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:26,650
And so if you look in the research 
literature,

1873
01:32:26,651 --> 01:32:30,910
it's really fascinating because they're 
more older,

1874
01:32:30,911 --> 01:32:32,080
you know,
older studies.

1875
01:32:32,081 --> 01:32:35,200
There hasn't been as much research until
recently on fasting,

1876
01:32:35,201 --> 01:32:38,740
but fasting has been shown to be a cure 
for all kinds of different conditions.

1877
01:32:38,741 --> 01:32:39,570
Like,
you know,

1878
01:32:39,580 --> 01:32:44,580
severe rheumatoid arthritis,
patient can fast and then be completely 

1879
01:32:44,580 --> 01:32:46,270
symptom free.
And of course they can't keep that up.

1880
01:32:46,271 --> 01:32:49,120
You can't just fast forever.
You obviously will die.

1881
01:32:49,180 --> 01:32:53,890
But that alone tells us something 
interesting about fasting and about food

1882
01:32:53,891 --> 01:32:56,020
and how food is impacting those 
conditions.

1883
01:32:56,180 --> 01:32:58,040
Yeah,
that is absolutely fascinating.

1884
01:32:58,390 --> 01:33:03,350
I'm the consumption of carbohydrates.
Dom d'agostino put something up about it

1885
01:33:03,590 --> 01:33:08,590
recently,
a low sugar and carbs that they're 

1886
01:33:08,590 --> 01:33:09,950
closer and closer to connecting sugar 
and carbs to cancer.

1887
01:33:11,090 --> 01:33:16,090
This is a pretty controversial area and 
I'll say right off the top that I don't 

1888
01:33:16,090 --> 01:33:17,350
consider myself to be an expert.
Um,

1889
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:17,930
so,
uh,

1890
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:19,170
you know,
uh,

1891
01:33:19,310 --> 01:33:24,310
I'll probably just pass on this,
but I think there's certainly enough 

1892
01:33:24,310 --> 01:33:27,650
research pointing in that direction to 
continue to look at that and they're,

1893
01:33:28,030 --> 01:33:30,020
you know,
even he probably talked about this,

1894
01:33:30,021 --> 01:33:35,021
but drugs like metformin which limit the
availability of glucose are being 

1895
01:33:35,021 --> 01:33:36,650
studied even by the nih,
you know,

1896
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:41,680
very traditional mainstream scientific 
organizations as a therapy therapeutics 

1897
01:33:42,770 --> 01:33:47,770
for cancer as is ketogenic diet,
dom studying non and others are as well.

1898
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:50,320
Um,
but I think it'S a little too early to,

1899
01:33:50,350 --> 01:33:55,350
to,
to say that all cancer is caused by 

1900
01:33:55,350 --> 01:33:56,030
high,
high blood glucose level.

1901
01:33:56,040 --> 01:33:57,520
The antibodies saying,
all right,

1902
01:33:57,990 --> 01:34:02,990
I think they're,
they're saying there's a strong 

1903
01:34:02,990 --> 01:34:04,701
correlation between the two.
Now when you look at the overall 

1904
01:34:04,701 --> 01:34:08,271
american diet and the number of chronic 
diseases and all the different various 

1905
01:34:08,271 --> 01:34:10,860
things that we have,
and you correlate all these factors,

1906
01:34:10,861 --> 01:34:14,310
when you think about sedentary 
lifestyle,

1907
01:34:14,311 --> 01:34:19,311
you think about the lack of sleep,
and then of course you think about diet 

1908
01:34:19,311 --> 01:34:19,311
and exercise.
Um,

1909
01:34:20,220 --> 01:34:25,220
when do you think people are gonna 
recognize or how do we get people to 

1910
01:34:26,431 --> 01:34:31,431
recognize that what they're eating and 
what the average person is eating is not

1911
01:34:32,371 --> 01:34:37,371
what the body's designed for.
And this may very well be what has 

1912
01:34:37,371 --> 01:34:38,010
triggered this whole cascade of effects.

1913
01:34:38,450 --> 01:34:43,450
That's the trillion dollar question,
literally trillion dollar question 

1914
01:34:43,450 --> 01:34:44,090
because we spend three point 
$2,000,000,000,000

1915
01:34:44,230 --> 01:34:46,900
on healthcare a year.
Um,

1916
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:49,250
so,
you know,

1917
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:54,300
I,
I think there's an easy way in a hard 

1918
01:34:54,300 --> 01:34:57,071
way to get there.
So the easy way is that we continue to 

1919
01:34:57,071 --> 01:34:58,190
raise awareness through books and,
and things

1920
01:34:58,190 --> 01:35:00,320
like this.
And you know,

1921
01:35:00,530 --> 01:35:01,340
um,
we,

1922
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:06,400
we make proactive changes to the 
healthcare system that support the most 

1923
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:08,270
important intervention.
So let's use an example again,

1924
01:35:09,090 --> 01:35:13,190
I'm imagine it so,
so you go into the doctor right now,

1925
01:35:13,191 --> 01:35:15,170
let's say you're one of those 100 
million people that has,

1926
01:35:15,230 --> 01:35:20,230
you know,
type two diabetes or prediabetes and 

1927
01:35:20,230 --> 01:35:20,230
they,
they,

1928
01:35:20,230 --> 01:35:23,110
they test your blood sugar,
they say your fasting glucose is 96 joe 

1929
01:35:23,110 --> 01:35:25,040
and your hemoglobin a one c is five 
point five.

1930
01:35:25,041 --> 01:35:26,210
Good news.
That's normal.

1931
01:35:26,690 --> 01:35:27,140
Well,
yeah,

1932
01:35:27,141 --> 01:35:29,540
okay.
It's in the normal range but it's in the

1933
01:35:29,541 --> 01:35:32,480
high end of the normal range in the 
current system.

1934
01:35:32,481 --> 01:35:35,930
They'll just tell you it's normal.
They might maybe maybe not make any kind

1935
01:35:35,931 --> 01:35:38,840
of dietary recommendations and then send
you on your way.

1936
01:35:39,350 --> 01:35:43,400
And the idea is we're not going to pay 
attention to this until it's not normal.

1937
01:35:43,890 --> 01:35:45,440
You know,
we're not going to pay attention to this

1938
01:35:45,441 --> 01:35:48,410
until you actually do have prediabetes 
or diabetes.

1939
01:35:48,470 --> 01:35:50,420
And um,
so the,

1940
01:35:50,421 --> 01:35:55,421
wait until you have that.
And then of course the longer that you 

1941
01:35:55,421 --> 01:35:56,390
wait to treat it,
the harder it is to reverse.

1942
01:35:56,391 --> 01:35:57,470
And then you.
And then when,

1943
01:35:57,510 --> 01:35:59,720
when,
once they do find that you have it,

1944
01:36:00,140 --> 01:36:03,190
they just give you a drug rather than,
you know,

1945
01:36:03,330 --> 01:36:06,530
give you any kind of real support to 
make diet changes.

1946
01:36:06,531 --> 01:36:11,531
So even if the doctor is,
it does know what to do or what to tell 

1947
01:36:11,531 --> 01:36:13,910
you about diet,
which they often don't because they just

1948
01:36:13,911 --> 01:36:15,830
don't have a lot of training in that 
area.

1949
01:36:15,890 --> 01:36:20,490
And it's also how few people really have
the contents of their body analyzed.

1950
01:36:20,630 --> 01:36:22,460
How many people actually get blood work 
done,

1951
01:36:22,461 --> 01:36:22,820
right?
Well,

1952
01:36:22,830 --> 01:36:25,820
I'd say 80 percent don't even know they 
have prediabetes,

1953
01:36:26,150 --> 01:36:31,150
but let's assume that they do and let's 
assume they get to the doctor and let's 

1954
01:36:31,150 --> 01:36:31,550
assume the doctor even knows what to 
tell them.

1955
01:36:31,660 --> 01:36:33,980
Right?
If they tell them that are they,

1956
01:36:34,220 --> 01:36:39,220
does that gonna be enough to make that 
person successful in changing their 

1957
01:36:39,220 --> 01:36:40,250
diet?
And especially not if their gut biome is

1958
01:36:40,251 --> 01:36:44,060
program to crave that sugar and they 
have low willpower especially,

1959
01:36:44,061 --> 01:36:46,940
they get very little sleep at work all 
the time.

1960
01:36:46,941 --> 01:36:48,740
All those factors,
those factors.

1961
01:36:48,741 --> 01:36:53,741
And we know they like most importantly,
information alone is not enough to 

1962
01:36:53,741 --> 01:36:54,080
change behavior.
We,

1963
01:36:54,240 --> 01:36:57,110
I said that before,
that's well established scientifically,

1964
01:36:57,380 --> 01:36:58,610
Just telling someone,
hey,

1965
01:36:58,611 --> 01:37:00,320
you should eat a healthier diet.
You know,

1966
01:37:00,321 --> 01:37:05,321
one percent of people are going to be 
able to retake that information and act 

1967
01:37:05,321 --> 01:37:05,810
on it successfully,
especially over the long term.

1968
01:37:06,530 --> 01:37:11,530
But let's imagine a different scenario.
Let's imagine you can go into the 

1969
01:37:11,530 --> 01:37:11,530
doctor.
Same thing.

1970
01:37:11,530 --> 01:37:13,040
They test your blood sugar.
It's,

1971
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:15,530
you know,
high normal fasting glucose,

1972
01:37:15,531 --> 01:37:17,300
high normal agency,
and they sit down,

1973
01:37:17,301 --> 01:37:17,870
they say,
look,

1974
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:23,320
joe,
and this is obviously happening in an 

1975
01:37:23,320 --> 01:37:23,320
appointment in this longer than eight 
minutes,

1976
01:37:23,320 --> 01:37:23,320
right?

1977
01:37:23,320 --> 01:37:23,690
They sit down,
they say,

1978
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:26,570
well,
you're not prediabetic yet.

1979
01:37:27,020 --> 01:37:28,790
um,
but your blood sugar's starting to creep

1980
01:37:28,791 --> 01:37:33,791
up.
And I'm worried that if we don't do 

1981
01:37:33,791 --> 01:37:33,791
something now,
you're going to get,

1982
01:37:33,791 --> 01:37:34,460
you're going to become prediabetic and 
eventually diabetic.

1983
01:37:34,910 --> 01:37:36,710
so,
you know,

1984
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:39,890
I could give you a drug,
but that's just putting a bandaid on the

1985
01:37:39,891 --> 01:37:44,891
problem.
So what I'm going to do instead is I'm 

1986
01:37:44,891 --> 01:37:45,500
gonna hook you up with our health coach 
and nutritionist and she,

1987
01:37:45,530 --> 01:37:49,730
he or she is going to create a recipe 
for you meal plan.

1988
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:54,760
They're going to come to your house.
They're going to clean out your pantry 

1989
01:37:54,760 --> 01:37:54,760
and get up,
get rid of all the bad foodS.

1990
01:37:54,760 --> 01:37:58,840
They're going to go shopping with you 
and show you actually exactly what you 

1991
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:02,931
need to buy.
They're going to help you set up these 

1992
01:38:02,931 --> 01:38:05,091
meal plans and give you recipes so that 
you know exactly what you should be 

1993
01:38:05,091 --> 01:38:08,391
doing or they're going to set you up 
with this meal planning service that we 

1994
01:38:08,391 --> 01:38:09,640
work with and I'm also gonna set you up.

1995
01:38:09,660 --> 01:38:14,660
You're going to get a gym membership and
you're going to get set up with a 

1996
01:38:14,660 --> 01:38:16,890
personal trainer at that gym and so that
you can start getting,

1997
01:38:16,891 --> 01:38:19,290
you know,
becoming more physically active.

1998
01:38:19,650 --> 01:38:24,650
We're going to give you this,
a online class that talks about sleep 

1999
01:38:24,650 --> 01:38:25,980
hygiene and how to get better night's 
sleep.

2000
01:38:25,981 --> 01:38:28,770
It's a six week program.
You do it for half hour a day,

2001
01:38:29,130 --> 01:38:31,020
no problem.
And here's the good news,

2002
01:38:31,021 --> 01:38:36,021
joe.
This is all going to be covered by your 

2003
01:38:36,021 --> 01:38:37,811
insurance.
You're not going to have to pay for any 

2004
01:38:37,811 --> 01:38:40,110
of this that you know.
That is totally possible.

2005
01:38:40,440 --> 01:38:45,440
And not only that,
is there any doubt that if even if we 

2006
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:46,290
spent $10,000,
let's say,

2007
01:38:46,291 --> 01:38:51,291
which is more than that would cost even 
including the health coach and the fees 

2008
01:38:51,291 --> 01:38:52,350
for the gym and the fees for the 
personal trainer.

2009
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,870
If we spent that amount of money right 
up front,

2010
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:59,820
we could put that per get that person's 
blood sugar back to normal level,

2011
01:39:00,210 --> 01:39:03,510
prevent them from ever getting type two 
diabetes in the first place,

2012
01:39:04,020 --> 01:39:09,020
give them way more confidence in their 
own ability to take care of themselves 

2013
01:39:09,020 --> 01:39:11,400
and prevent disease,
make them feel better and probably every

2014
01:39:11,401 --> 01:39:16,401
other way and save the healthcare system
$640,000

2015
01:39:16,501 --> 01:39:18,300
over the next 45 years.

2016
01:39:18,780 --> 01:39:23,780
We could have that.
There's nothing stopping that from 

2017
01:39:23,780 --> 01:39:26,061
happening.
The real question is how do you get 

2018
01:39:26,061 --> 01:39:26,061
someone to act?
That's the question.

2019
01:39:26,061 --> 01:39:26,900
That's true.
Inspiration.

2020
01:39:27,090 --> 01:39:30,570
I said with the health coach so that 
it's not actually.

2021
01:39:30,660 --> 01:39:33,450
I mean this is well defined.
We had.

2022
01:39:33,451 --> 01:39:38,451
There's so much research on behavior 
change and evidence based principles 

2023
01:39:38,451 --> 01:39:42,231
that support behavior change.
So there there are techniques like 

2024
01:39:42,231 --> 01:39:43,320
motivational interviewing,
coaching to strengths.

2025
01:39:43,410 --> 01:39:46,830
I'm a coach into strengths.
Yeah.

2026
01:39:46,860 --> 01:39:50,540
So that,
that means helping people identify and,

2027
01:39:50,630 --> 01:39:53,880
and work with their strengths rather 
than trying to fix what's broken.

2028
01:39:54,770 --> 01:39:59,770
Um,
motivational interviewing is what would 

2029
01:39:59,770 --> 01:40:02,240
be an example of that.
Let's you have a person works a regular 

2030
01:40:02,240 --> 01:40:03,030
normal job and they've got a big gut and
don't want to lose.

2031
01:40:03,090 --> 01:40:04,350
We have a,
you have a,

2032
01:40:04,540 --> 01:40:08,010
it's shifting the focus around from 
what's wrong,

2033
01:40:08,100 --> 01:40:10,950
which is really disempowering.
Like I can't do that.

2034
01:40:10,980 --> 01:40:11,640
I'm,
I'm,

2035
01:40:11,641 --> 01:40:16,641
this way.
I'd have no willpower or whatever to 

2036
01:40:16,641 --> 01:40:19,160
helping them become aware of certain 
personality traits or characteristics 

2037
01:40:19,160 --> 01:40:22,860
that they can then use to make the 
change that they want to make.

2038
01:40:23,220 --> 01:40:28,050
Motivational interviewing is like this.
Imagine a woman who's 55,

2039
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:30,540
you know,
finds out that she has type two diabetes

2040
01:40:30,541 --> 01:40:33,690
and the doctor's like,
you should eat a better diet and she's,

2041
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:38,840
she would like to,
but she's overworked and tired and it 

2042
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:42,561
feels overwhelming and,
and she's just not really finding the 

2043
01:40:42,561 --> 01:40:43,800
motivation to do that in this,
you know,

2044
01:40:44,190 --> 01:40:46,650
but she has grandkids.
She loves her grandkids.

2045
01:40:46,651 --> 01:40:51,651
She wants to see them grow up.
She wants to be able to play with them 

2046
01:40:51,651 --> 01:40:54,531
without becoming blind and immobile from
type two diabetes and so the the per the

2047
01:40:55,450 --> 01:40:57,520
health coach is trained in motivational 
interviewing,

2048
01:40:57,521 --> 01:41:02,170
can help her help that,
that patient to be able to tie that,

2049
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:07,200
those deeper values and goals and 
motivations with the health goal so that

2050
01:41:08,891 --> 01:41:11,140
it's not just eating a healthy diet for 
the,

2051
01:41:11,170 --> 01:41:16,170
for the sake of eating a healthy diet,
it's eating a healthy diet because I 

2052
01:41:16,170 --> 01:41:17,860
really want to see my grandkids grow up 
and be able to play with them.

2053
01:41:18,510 --> 01:41:23,510
OkAy,
so and then there are these principles 

2054
01:41:23,510 --> 01:41:24,400
of behavior change that are,
that are totally well established.

2055
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:29,880
So one is shrink.
The change is a colloquial way of 

2056
01:41:29,880 --> 01:41:34,231
putting it.
Like let's say you're going to start a 

2057
01:41:34,231 --> 01:41:36,850
meditation practice.
The way to not do it is to say,

2058
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:38,470
okay,
so start doing that.

2059
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:40,960
Do an hour of meditation a day.
Good luck with that.

2060
01:41:41,110 --> 01:41:46,110
You know,
that's gonna fail in 99 point nine 

2061
01:41:46,110 --> 01:41:46,300
percent of the cases.
The way to do it might be,

2062
01:41:46,760 --> 01:41:48,490
okay,
step one,

2063
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:53,640
not even that step one,
download the headspace app on your 

2064
01:41:53,640 --> 01:41:53,640
phone.
That's it,

2065
01:41:53,640 --> 01:41:54,520
that's your first step,
you know,

2066
01:41:54,610 --> 01:41:56,740
step two,
but get a meditation cushion.

2067
01:41:57,100 --> 01:41:58,330
That's it.
Step three,

2068
01:41:58,810 --> 01:42:01,870
you know,
open the headspace app and do your first

2069
01:42:01,871 --> 01:42:03,040
two minute meditation.
I mean,

2070
01:42:03,041 --> 01:42:05,890
the headspace app is actually built in 
this way where they start,

2071
01:42:05,891 --> 01:42:10,891
you very small and you build up 
gradually over time because they know 

2072
01:42:10,891 --> 01:42:11,830
about those principles of behavior 
change.

2073
01:42:12,440 --> 01:42:17,440
Uh,
we know that behavior change works 

2074
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:17,440
better in community.
Um,

2075
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:17,440
this is,
uh,

2076
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:22,110
this is a head spinner to obesity.
Some people have argued is a contagious 

2077
01:42:22,110 --> 01:42:26,521
disease because people who have friends 
that are obese are more likely to be 

2078
01:42:26,521 --> 01:42:27,280
obese themselves.

2079
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:29,690
You know what,
that,

2080
01:42:29,720 --> 01:42:31,310
that makes a lot of sense.
And,

2081
01:42:31,350 --> 01:42:32,900
uh,
here's an example of something,

2082
01:42:33,060 --> 01:42:34,880
one of the reasons why that makes a lot 
of sense.

2083
01:42:35,180 --> 01:42:40,180
Uh,
we just did this thing sober october me 

2084
01:42:40,180 --> 01:42:40,180
and uh,
yeah,

2085
01:42:40,180 --> 01:42:43,160
and our shaffir tom score,
bert kreischer and I,

2086
01:42:43,190 --> 01:42:45,740
we took 15 hot yoga classes,
no booze,

2087
01:42:45,741 --> 01:42:50,741
no weed for a month,
but because we were doing it all 

2088
01:42:50,741 --> 01:42:50,741
together and we kept checking in on each
other,

2089
01:42:50,741 --> 01:42:55,511
it was very motivating and um,
and no one's strayed and we all were 

2090
01:42:56,061 --> 01:42:59,870
doing it too.
We knew that we had,

2091
01:43:01,550 --> 01:43:03,530
we had all,
we had a responsibility,

2092
01:43:03,580 --> 01:43:06,190
we have responsibility to the group and 
that we,

2093
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:11,240
we knew that we're motivating each other
as well as pushing each other and 

2094
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:12,380
talking shit to each other and making 
fun of each other,

2095
01:43:12,410 --> 01:43:16,790
which is what we do nationally.
But at the end of it we were like,

2096
01:43:16,791 --> 01:43:18,140
wow,
that was great.

2097
01:43:18,141 --> 01:43:20,810
like there's something to that.
Like a lot of us were like,

2098
01:43:20,870 --> 01:43:24,470
I'm never doing yoga again for yoga and 
I'm getting drunk for a week.

2099
01:43:24,770 --> 01:43:29,770
but the real takeaway from it was there 
was some measurable motivation and 

2100
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:34,880
inspiration from having three friends 
doing it with me.

2101
01:43:35,080 --> 01:43:40,080
Absolutely.
And that's again been improving in the 

2102
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:43,200
science and even just having one person 
like a health coach who can play that 

2103
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:46,741
role and be accountable,
they can help you get in touch with the 

2104
01:43:46,741 --> 01:43:51,301
real motivation for doing it.
They can actually design a program for 

2105
01:43:51,301 --> 01:43:55,141
you that's life likely to succeed 
instead of fail or perhaps online 

2106
01:43:55,141 --> 01:43:58,841
groups.
There's got to be online groups to get 

2107
01:43:58,841 --> 01:43:58,841
involved with.
We have the knowledge and the technology

2108
01:43:58,841 --> 01:44:00,320
to do this.
And it's not,

2109
01:44:00,321 --> 01:44:05,321
It doesn't take a long time.
You can retrain a health coach in six 

2110
01:44:05,321 --> 01:44:08,021
months or a year.
They don't need to have nine years of 

2111
01:44:08,021 --> 01:44:08,021
premedical,
you know,

2112
01:44:08,021 --> 01:44:10,190
traIning and biological sciences and all
this.

2113
01:44:10,191 --> 01:44:12,200
They just need to be trained in behavior
change.

2114
01:44:12,230 --> 01:44:17,230
You know,
they need to be people who can form a 

2115
01:44:17,230 --> 01:44:18,110
good relatIonship with somebody else and
build that trust and rapport.

2116
01:44:18,410 --> 01:44:20,240
They need to have some knowledge,
of course,

2117
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:23,570
of diet and lifestyle and stuff.
But like I said,

2118
01:44:23,571 --> 01:44:28,571
imagine that you go into your doctor and
they actually hook you up with someone 

2119
01:44:28,571 --> 01:44:29,820
like that who has all that training.
Um,

2120
01:44:29,930 --> 01:44:34,760
if you think of how the healthcare 
population as like a pyramid,

2121
01:44:35,220 --> 01:44:36,830
yeah,
at the top of the pyramid you've got,

2122
01:44:36,831 --> 01:44:41,831
you know,
people who are really sick and who were 

2123
01:44:41,831 --> 01:44:41,831
in the hospital or in some kind of acute
care setting,

2124
01:44:41,831 --> 01:44:45,290
they absolutely need intensive support 
from the conventional medical system.

2125
01:44:45,740 --> 01:44:50,740
Then you go down,
you've got another 25 percent of people 

2126
01:44:50,740 --> 01:44:54,131
who have some kind of pretty 
debilitating chronic disease where they 

2127
01:44:54,131 --> 01:44:56,360
need to be seeing a doctor regularly,
but then in the bottom 70 percent you've

2128
01:44:56,361 --> 01:44:58,490
got a lot of people who are just 
overweight.

2129
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:01,040
They're tired,
they're not sleeping very well.

2130
01:45:01,041 --> 01:45:02,570
They got some gut issues.

2131
01:45:02,570 --> 01:45:05,210
They got some skin problems.
I.

2132
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:10,240
My argument is that those people can be 
really well served by well trained 

2133
01:45:10,551 --> 01:45:14,210
health coaches and nutritionists who can
work intensively with them on diet,

2134
01:45:14,510 --> 01:45:19,510
lifestyle and behavior change and we 
know that those changes are the single 

2135
01:45:19,510 --> 01:45:22,070
most important step we can take to 
prevent and reverse disease.

2136
01:45:22,370 --> 01:45:25,730
But we also know that just telling 
people about it doesn't work.

2137
01:45:26,180 --> 01:45:28,580
You have to create that support system.
Well,

2138
01:45:28,581 --> 01:45:33,581
our whole food system is so crazy 
because it's so fraught with peril 

2139
01:45:33,581 --> 01:45:35,300
everywhere you go.
It's a goddamn minefield.

2140
01:45:35,330 --> 01:45:37,550
Exactly.
You're trying to eat a healthy diet.

2141
01:45:37,790 --> 01:45:41,780
You have to go way out of your way to 
find what you can consume.

2142
01:45:41,781 --> 01:45:43,340
Oh,
there it is over there.

2143
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:45,440
Whereas if you just want to eat a shitty
diet,

2144
01:45:45,500 --> 01:45:49,880
it's everywhere in front of you.
The the vast majority of the food that's

2145
01:45:49,881 --> 01:45:51,470
available to us is not healthy.

2146
01:45:51,560 --> 01:45:52,450
Yeah.
Yeah.

2147
01:45:52,460 --> 01:45:57,460
I mean if,
if you took somebody from our culture 

2148
01:45:57,460 --> 01:46:01,751
and drop them into like,
there's this group called the cmo manet 

2149
01:46:01,751 --> 01:46:05,501
and Bolivia.
They're a hunter gatherer group that's 

2150
01:46:05,501 --> 01:46:05,501
still follows their traditional 
lifestyle.

2151
01:46:05,501 --> 01:46:09,131
if you took someone from here,
drop them in there and just made them 

2152
01:46:09,131 --> 01:46:10,910
live that way,
they'd get healthy because they wouldn't

2153
01:46:10,911 --> 01:46:11,910
have any choice.
You know,

2154
01:46:11,930 --> 01:46:13,610
they would eat what was there and 
they'd,

2155
01:46:14,030 --> 01:46:16,570
they'd be living outdoors and they 
wouldn't have ipads.

2156
01:46:16,620 --> 01:46:20,570
They're staying up and looking at it 
until two in the morning and you know,

2157
01:46:20,940 --> 01:46:25,940
they would be healthy,
but likewise they'd get killed by a 

2158
01:46:25,940 --> 01:46:25,940
jaguar or they'd get.
Yeah,

2159
01:46:25,940 --> 01:46:27,170
exactly.
It's definitely possible,

2160
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:32,920
but if you took one of those people and 
you drop them into here like woodland 

2161
01:46:32,920 --> 01:46:35,600
hills or New York city or san francisco 
or anywhere else,

2162
01:46:35,601 --> 01:46:37,880
is there any question that what's going 
to happen?

2163
01:46:37,881 --> 01:46:40,820
They're the same exact thing that 
happens to all of us in this,

2164
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:41,900
in this modern.
Well,

2165
01:46:41,901 --> 01:46:44,360
we've seen that with the nun when the.
When the nun.

2166
01:46:44,450 --> 01:46:49,450
One of the more fascinating things about
studying the nun was how small the 

2167
01:46:49,450 --> 01:46:50,010
number of people

2168
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:54,480
that got cancer was such an incredibly 
small number and they essentially had no

2169
01:46:54,481 --> 01:46:59,481
vegetables.
They were eating fats from seals and 

2170
01:46:59,481 --> 01:47:00,480
wail and whatever.
They could consume.

2171
01:47:00,580 --> 01:47:04,480
Extremely limited diet environment.
Yeah,

2172
01:47:04,570 --> 01:47:08,790
very harsh environment and.
But they had adapted to it and then when

2173
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:13,880
western America came into their lives in
terms of like cigarettes,

2174
01:47:14,910 --> 01:47:17,280
shitty food,
alcohol,

2175
01:47:17,670 --> 01:47:20,640
refined carbohydrates,
cancer rates

2176
01:47:20,970 --> 01:47:23,010
through the roof,
just through the roof.

2177
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:26,220
Which is fascinating because their jeans
hadn't changed.

2178
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:31,600
Absolutely the same genes.
They're not going to change in one 

2179
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:31,820
generation or even two or three.
Yeah,

2180
01:47:31,870 --> 01:47:32,940
it's,
it's horrible.

2181
01:47:33,060 --> 01:47:36,180
Have you seen west and price?
You familiar with his work?

2182
01:47:36,570 --> 01:47:38,400
I know the name,
so it was,

2183
01:47:38,401 --> 01:47:42,030
he was a dentist back in like the 19 
twenties and thirties,

2184
01:47:42,090 --> 01:47:45,120
and he wrote a book called nutrition and
physical degeneration.

2185
01:47:45,240 --> 01:47:48,600
And what he as a dentIst,
his main interest was why did,

2186
01:47:48,620 --> 01:47:51,330
why did so many cavities,
that doesn't seem natural,

2187
01:47:51,390 --> 01:47:56,390
right?
It doesn't seem normal that were 

2188
01:47:56,390 --> 01:47:57,120
designed to just develop rotten teeth.
You thought this is stupid.

2189
01:47:57,600 --> 01:48:02,600
So I'm going to go around and study all 
of these traditional cultures all over 

2190
01:48:02,600 --> 01:48:06,831
the world.
And first I want to find out do they 

2191
01:48:06,831 --> 01:48:09,171
have cavities and dental decay and,
and like a narrowing of the dental arch 

2192
01:48:09,171 --> 01:48:12,540
and changes in facial structure that we 
have in the industrialized world.

2193
01:48:12,930 --> 01:48:14,880
And the second question is,
if not,

2194
01:48:15,270 --> 01:48:17,240
what is the common element,
you know,

2195
01:48:17,250 --> 01:48:19,800
with all of these cultures,
it's different than our culture.

2196
01:48:20,460 --> 01:48:23,940
And in his book he shows pictures.
So first of all,

2197
01:48:23,941 --> 01:48:25,320
the answer to the question was,
no,

2198
01:48:25,380 --> 01:48:28,380
it's not normal for humans to develop 
cavities and rotten teeth.

2199
01:48:28,381 --> 01:48:29,250
I mean,
how could it be?

2200
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:32,400
How could we survive in the natural 
world if our teeth are all falling out?

2201
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:34,300
Um,
so he,

2202
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:38,580
he went and he took pictures of these 
people all around the world,

2203
01:48:38,581 --> 01:48:39,580
like in africa,
the,

2204
01:48:39,581 --> 01:48:41,340
my side,
a hunter gatherer,

2205
01:48:41,341 --> 01:48:42,440
people,
uh,

2206
01:48:42,750 --> 01:48:45,390
people living in a remote part of 
Switzerland,

2207
01:48:45,391 --> 01:48:50,391
isolated up in the hills that had 
maintain their traditional diet and 

2208
01:48:50,391 --> 01:48:52,080
lifestyle and all of them had these 
beautiful teeth,

2209
01:48:52,230 --> 01:48:54,690
big wide round faces,
dent,

2210
01:48:54,750 --> 01:48:56,360
you know,
wide dental arches,

2211
01:48:56,450 --> 01:48:58,080
you know,
all of these signs of health.

2212
01:48:58,680 --> 01:49:03,680
But he also in the book had pictures of 
people from those same areas that had 

2213
01:49:03,680 --> 01:49:05,530
switched to move to the city,
you know,

2214
01:49:05,570 --> 01:49:08,790
switch to modern lifestyle within one 
generation.

2215
01:49:09,240 --> 01:49:14,240
You see people with these wide faces,
big healthy teeth smiling on one side of

2216
01:49:14,311 --> 01:49:19,311
the page.
And on the other side of the page you 

2217
01:49:19,311 --> 01:49:19,311
see people with these narrow faces like 
mine,

2218
01:49:19,311 --> 01:49:19,890
uh,
you know,

2219
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:21,260
rotten teeth,
you know,

2220
01:49:21,420 --> 01:49:26,420
totally it's crooked teeth and the kind 
of dental problems that we all have 

2221
01:49:26,420 --> 01:49:28,650
where most of us get braces and all this
stuff.

2222
01:49:28,860 --> 01:49:33,860
And that happened in just one generation
of switching from a traditional diet to 

2223
01:49:33,860 --> 01:49:35,280
a modern either faced then,
uh,

2224
01:49:35,460 --> 01:49:40,460
so vitamin k two and,
and a lot number of vitamins are 

2225
01:49:40,460 --> 01:49:43,080
responsible for facial development.
So if you,

2226
01:49:43,170 --> 01:49:48,170
uh,
if you look in the book of a western 

2227
01:49:48,170 --> 01:49:48,170
prices,
um,

2228
01:49:48,170 --> 01:49:48,310
pictures,
you see most people

2229
01:49:48,640 --> 01:49:49,720
in the,
in,

2230
01:49:49,900 --> 01:49:51,880
in those traditional worlds have these 
broad,

2231
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,040
healthy dental arches.
And then,

2232
01:49:54,510 --> 01:49:59,510
uh,
in our culture because of nutrient 

2233
01:49:59,510 --> 01:50:01,801
deficiencies and we're not eating the 
healthy nutrient dense foods are faces 

2234
01:50:01,801 --> 01:50:02,530
get more narrow,
our chins received,

2235
01:50:02,890 --> 01:50:07,890
we have our mouths become more crowded,
which is why many people can't fit the 

2236
01:50:08,020 --> 01:50:13,020
number of normal adult teeth in their 
mouth because they're dental arches so 

2237
01:50:13,020 --> 01:50:16,561
narrowly.
So that's all from that nutritional 

2238
01:50:16,561 --> 01:50:16,561
deficiencies.
Absolutely.

2239
01:50:16,561 --> 01:50:20,370
Why I had to get,
I had to get adult teeth pulled when I 

2240
01:50:20,370 --> 01:50:24,211
was a teenager because my mouth didn't 
have enough room for all of my adult 

2241
01:50:24,211 --> 01:50:24,211
teeth.

2242
01:50:26,310 --> 01:50:28,600
Does the rest of your family have 
similar facial structure?

2243
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:30,190
Um,
yeah.

2244
01:50:30,300 --> 01:50:31,540
Largely.
Yeah.

2245
01:50:31,541 --> 01:50:32,590
I mean,
you can check this out.

2246
01:50:32,591 --> 01:50:34,570
It's really interesting things to do in 
the airport.

2247
01:50:35,240 --> 01:50:36,010
I liked it,
you know,

2248
01:50:36,011 --> 01:50:39,670
you just look at people's faces.
Often you'll see like the chin is really

2249
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:41,460
receded and not,
you know,

2250
01:50:41,461 --> 01:50:44,860
not like a strong,
you'll see in a narrow face like mine.

2251
01:50:45,340 --> 01:50:47,050
Um,
and if you,

2252
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:52,600
you might see a,
a person from africa or someone who's 

2253
01:50:52,600 --> 01:50:52,870
more connected to their traditional diet
lifestyle,

2254
01:50:52,871 --> 01:50:55,990
they'll typically have a rounder face,
a more full face,

2255
01:50:56,050 --> 01:51:00,100
broader dental arch.
They'll have straight teeth with wider,

2256
01:51:00,520 --> 01:51:02,400
wider teeth.
And you can,

2257
01:51:02,430 --> 01:51:03,580
you can,
anyone can do this.

2258
01:51:03,590 --> 01:51:08,590
Anyone can see and look and you can 
almost predict how long has that person 

2259
01:51:08,590 --> 01:51:10,150
been away from their traditional diet 
and lifestyle.

2260
01:51:10,330 --> 01:51:12,730
Wow.
I never knew that.

2261
01:51:12,910 --> 01:51:15,550
You know,
that's a fascinating point.

2262
01:51:15,670 --> 01:51:20,320
It's a big variable in martial arts and 
the ability to take a punch.

2263
01:51:20,830 --> 01:51:22,690
Well your face is,
it's pretty round.

2264
01:51:23,570 --> 01:51:27,140
You have a broader,
but it's not just what you're eating is.

2265
01:51:27,190 --> 01:51:31,180
My mom is very wide.
Have a thick mom spiLling pit bull.

2266
01:51:31,300 --> 01:51:36,300
Yeah.
Well it's probably part of why you're 

2267
01:51:36,300 --> 01:51:39,430
probably a good performer is that you've
got that structure that supports it.

2268
01:51:39,790 --> 01:51:44,790
Yeah.
I'm sure it has something to do with it 

2269
01:51:44,790 --> 01:51:44,790
genetically.
Um,

2270
01:51:44,790 --> 01:51:47,520
but the,
the ability to take a punch is I think 

2271
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:47,800
directly related to the size of your 
face.

2272
01:51:47,930 --> 01:51:48,490
Yeah.
Yeah.

2273
01:51:49,120 --> 01:51:51,520
Guys with smaller jaws and smaller 
faces,

2274
01:51:51,640 --> 01:51:54,340
they have a much harder time getting 
hit.

2275
01:51:54,490 --> 01:51:56,880
I wouldn't last long.
Well,

2276
01:51:56,920 --> 01:51:58,840
like samoans are the best at it.
Yeah.

2277
01:51:59,130 --> 01:52:01,060
It was just such a pro.
For example,

2278
01:52:01,061 --> 01:52:06,061
instruction.
Weston price has a lot of pictures from 

2279
01:52:06,061 --> 01:52:06,061
people in the south pacific and that 
region,

2280
01:52:06,061 --> 01:52:07,090
you know,
examples of these beautiful.

2281
01:52:07,090 --> 01:52:08,470
You should check it.
You would love the book.

2282
01:52:08,471 --> 01:52:12,490
It's really amazing to see the 
juxtaposition of those traditional faces

2283
01:52:12,491 --> 01:52:14,880
with the modern ones.
It's like you,

2284
01:52:14,980 --> 01:52:18,100
I mean,
a picture's worth a thousand words,

2285
01:52:18,101 --> 01:52:23,101
right?
You just look at those pictures and 

2286
01:52:23,101 --> 01:52:23,101
you're just like,
oh my god.

2287
01:52:23,101 --> 01:52:23,101
TotallY makes sense.
Yeah.

2288
01:52:23,101 --> 01:52:25,330
Yeah.
It is a very weird.

2289
01:52:25,390 --> 01:52:30,390
When you think about what we're doing to
the human body and when you're talking 

2290
01:52:30,390 --> 01:52:32,110
about the diabetes levels that you're 
talking about,

2291
01:52:32,111 --> 01:52:37,111
or prediabetes and chronic disease and 
all the different issues and 40 percent 

2292
01:52:37,111 --> 01:52:38,560
obesity rate and the all these different
factors,

2293
01:52:39,480 --> 01:52:44,480
it's an epidemic that's sweeping through
the entire nation and it's largely,

2294
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:51,010
other than health fads,
a weight loss videos.

2295
01:52:51,021 --> 01:52:56,021
It's like peripherAlly examined.
I like to call it a slow motion plague.

2296
01:52:56,390 --> 01:53:01,100
Whoa.
Because like the bubonic plague,

2297
01:53:01,240 --> 01:53:03,290
you know,
which was a fast motion play.

2298
01:53:03,350 --> 01:53:08,350
It threatens us in the same way.
Like it's literally threatening the 

2299
01:53:08,350 --> 01:53:09,380
health of future generations.
It's shortening our lifespan.

2300
01:53:09,381 --> 01:53:12,050
It's destroying our quality of life.
It's a big one.

2301
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:13,310
Yeah.
And if you stay alive,

2302
01:53:13,311 --> 01:53:18,311
the quality of life is being devastated.
Or as a recent article that came out 

2303
01:53:18,311 --> 01:53:20,300
saying just that,
like is it was,

2304
01:53:20,600 --> 01:53:22,430
it was,
it was a paper that looked at,

2305
01:53:22,510 --> 01:53:27,510
um,
what's happening in our older years and 

2306
01:53:27,510 --> 01:53:27,510
saying,
yeah,

2307
01:53:27,510 --> 01:53:30,851
we have a long lifespan,
but our quality of life has 

2308
01:53:30,851 --> 01:53:33,461
significantly declined in those later 
years because we're burdened by all of 

2309
01:53:33,461 --> 01:53:33,620
these chronic diseases.
You know,

2310
01:53:33,621 --> 01:53:38,621
the average Something like a one in five
are two and five elderly people over 65 

2311
01:53:39,411 --> 01:53:41,360
are taking more than five medications.

2312
01:53:41,390 --> 01:53:46,390
It's a huge problem.
And this is the thing you hit on this 

2313
01:53:46,390 --> 01:53:49,211
point,
so I want to reiterate it because it's 

2314
01:53:49,211 --> 01:53:49,970
super important.
We have accepted chronIc diseases,

2315
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:55,000
normal because it's so common,
but there's a really important 

2316
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,290
difference between common and normal.
What's common is,

2317
01:53:57,550 --> 01:53:59,690
you know,
it's not necessarily normal,

2318
01:53:59,691 --> 01:54:04,691
it's now,
it's now common for people to have 

2319
01:54:04,691 --> 01:54:04,691
chronic disease,
but that's not normal.

2320
01:54:04,691 --> 01:54:06,110
How do we know?
Again,

2321
01:54:06,140 --> 01:54:11,140
the tsimané that's a.
It's a subsistence farming hunter 

2322
01:54:11,140 --> 01:54:14,201
gatherer population in Bolivia and 
recently there's been some articles in 

2323
01:54:14,201 --> 01:54:14,780
the New York times about them.
This,

2324
01:54:14,781 --> 01:54:19,781
some anthropologists,
medical anthropologists who've gotten 

2325
01:54:19,781 --> 01:54:20,540
and doctors and researchers have gone 
down there to study them.

2326
01:54:21,290 --> 01:54:25,100
They wanted to see that.
It's like this is one of the last places

2327
01:54:25,101 --> 01:54:28,640
on earth where people are still living 
pretty traditional diet and lifestyle,

2328
01:54:28,641 --> 01:54:31,010
so we better study this quickly,
you know,

2329
01:54:31,030 --> 01:54:33,980
to see what's normal,
what's truly normal for humans.

2330
01:54:33,980 --> 01:54:35,940
Not common but normal.
Yeah.

2331
01:54:36,140 --> 01:54:37,720
So they eat,
you know,

2332
01:54:38,540 --> 01:54:39,990
paleo type of diet.
You know,

2333
01:54:40,100 --> 01:54:43,040
fruits and vegetables,
some meat and fish,

2334
01:54:43,310 --> 01:54:45,020
nuts and seeds,
some plantings,

2335
01:54:45,080 --> 01:54:48,500
other kinds of starches.
They walk an average of 17,000

2336
01:54:48,501 --> 01:54:50,300
steps a day,
which is about eight miles.

2337
01:54:50,301 --> 01:54:55,301
So quite a bit.
They live in sync with the natural 

2338
01:54:55,301 --> 01:54:55,301
rhythms of light and dark.
You know,

2339
01:54:55,301 --> 01:54:58,160
they don't have a lot of artificial 
light exposure like we do.

2340
01:54:58,670 --> 01:54:59,960
They sleep seven,
eight hours.

2341
01:54:59,961 --> 01:55:04,961
In fact,
the researchers are trying to ask them 

2342
01:55:04,961 --> 01:55:04,961
about insomnia.
They didn't even have a word for it.

2343
01:55:04,961 --> 01:55:06,590
And their language,
they work.

2344
01:55:06,650 --> 01:55:07,200
Yeah,
they,

2345
01:55:07,700 --> 01:55:09,560
you know,
they're living their normal normal.

2346
01:55:09,650 --> 01:55:12,500
That's as closest we're going to get to 
a normal human population.

2347
01:55:12,501 --> 01:55:14,720
Right.
So they studied,

2348
01:55:14,810 --> 01:55:16,100
they studied,
um,

2349
01:55:16,130 --> 01:55:17,960
they,
they did blood markers on them for heart

2350
01:55:17,961 --> 01:55:19,040
disease,
but not only that,

2351
01:55:19,041 --> 01:55:21,860
they did scans ct scans of their heart,
you know,

2352
01:55:21,861 --> 01:55:26,060
the cfa had calcification of the 
arteries and they found that the rate of

2353
01:55:26,061 --> 01:55:31,061
heart disease in this population was 80 
percent lower than it was in than it is 

2354
01:55:31,061 --> 01:55:31,730
in the us.

2355
01:55:31,820 --> 01:55:34,250
Eighty percent lower.
Okay.

2356
01:55:34,580 --> 01:55:39,580
Nine and 10 to manet adults that they 
studied had absolutely no plaque buildup

2357
01:55:41,721 --> 01:55:46,721
in their arteries,
which means they have virtually no risk 

2358
01:55:46,721 --> 01:55:46,721
of a heart attack as far as we 
understand it.

2359
01:55:47,610 --> 01:55:52,610
And you know,
before anyone who's listening to this 

2360
01:55:52,610 --> 01:55:52,610
says,
oh yeah,

2361
01:55:52,610 --> 01:55:53,970
that's just because hunter gathers all 
die when they're 35 years old.

2362
01:55:53,971 --> 01:55:56,250
you know that familiar argument.
Well,

2363
01:55:56,251 --> 01:56:00,810
this study included people between the 
ages of 40 and 94 years old.

2364
01:56:01,560 --> 01:56:06,560
What's more,
tHe researchers estimated that the 

2365
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:09,261
average simani 80 year old had the same 
vascular age as an american in his mid 

2366
01:56:09,261 --> 01:56:11,370
fifties.
Whoa.

2367
01:56:12,180 --> 01:56:17,180
There's no almost no cognitive disorders
or alzheimer's disease in the 

2368
01:56:17,290 --> 01:56:21,600
[inaudible].
So that's a really clear example of what

2369
01:56:21,601 --> 01:56:26,601
happens when you give human beings the 
right inputs and they're not exposed to 

2370
01:56:26,601 --> 01:56:31,101
all this crap that we're exposed to.
They live long and healthy lives that 

2371
01:56:31,101 --> 01:56:35,991
are virtually free of chronic disease 
and that's despite the fact that they 

2372
01:56:35,991 --> 01:56:38,370
have much higher rates of infection than
we do.

2373
01:56:38,550 --> 01:56:41,670
They live on a river,
they've got parasites galore,

2374
01:56:41,671 --> 01:56:43,550
like all of them have parasites.
Yeah,

2375
01:56:43,830 --> 01:56:48,060
and yet they still are healthier than us
in almost every way you can measure it.

2376
01:56:48,061 --> 01:56:50,490
They have lower body mass index,
lower blood pressure,

2377
01:56:50,491 --> 01:56:52,770
lower weight.
They don't get heart disease.

2378
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:57,800
They don't get alzheimer's and dementia,
which is not like climbing up the list 

2379
01:56:57,800 --> 01:56:58,350
of,
of,

2380
01:56:58,420 --> 01:57:03,420
of causes of death and tripling.
I'm glad you brought up alzheimer's 

2381
01:57:03,420 --> 01:57:05,340
because I read something recently.
I didn't read the whole article.

2382
01:57:05,341 --> 01:57:09,930
I just read the title of it was 
connecting alzheimer's to gut bacteria.

2383
01:57:10,050 --> 01:57:11,310
Yeah,
absolutely.

2384
01:57:12,180 --> 01:57:17,180
There's a strong that this,
this actually something referred to as 

2385
01:57:17,180 --> 01:57:19,020
the gut brain access,
which is this very well known connection

2386
01:57:19,021 --> 01:57:21,270
between the gut and the brain and it 
goes both ways.

2387
01:57:21,271 --> 01:57:24,810
So you know,
the gut can influence the brain strongly

2388
01:57:24,840 --> 01:57:27,540
and the brain can influence the gut 
strongly.

2389
01:57:27,810 --> 01:57:29,640
So,
I mean,

2390
01:57:29,970 --> 01:57:33,330
my,
my point is just that what you said,

2391
01:57:33,331 --> 01:57:36,150
when are we going to realize that just 
these changes,

2392
01:57:36,220 --> 01:57:41,220
you know,
making these changes is what we need to 

2393
01:57:41,220 --> 01:57:41,220
do to prevent and reverse chronic 
disease.

2394
01:57:41,220 --> 01:57:41,900
And,
uh,

2395
01:57:41,940 --> 01:57:46,220
we have these examples of people like 
that that show us very clearly that it's

2396
01:57:46,260 --> 01:57:51,260
the way we're living,
not our genes that are causing this 

2397
01:57:51,260 --> 01:57:53,280
chronic disease epidemic.
So the easy way would be to,

2398
01:57:54,030 --> 01:57:55,770
you know,
write books about it,

2399
01:57:55,830 --> 01:57:57,180
you know,
have shows like this,

2400
01:57:57,181 --> 01:58:02,181
keep educating people and doing that.
And that's what I'm hoping for and 

2401
01:58:02,181 --> 01:58:03,140
that's why I wrote my book.
Um,

2402
01:58:03,750 --> 01:58:07,680
but the hard way is that our system 
fails,

2403
01:58:08,070 --> 01:58:13,070
that it becomes so overburdened by the 
rising rates of chronic disease and the 

2404
01:58:13,070 --> 01:58:15,450
unsustainable expenses of that,
that it,

2405
01:58:15,540 --> 01:58:20,540
it basically falls apart and it becomes,
you know,

2406
01:58:20,940 --> 01:58:25,940
we respond in a kind of to it as the 
crisis that it really is because it 

2407
01:58:25,940 --> 01:58:30,111
becomes apparent at that point that 
there are way that we've been doing it 

2408
01:58:30,111 --> 01:58:31,920
has not been working and that we 
desperately need to find a new way.

2409
01:58:32,540 --> 01:58:35,430
Um,
and that's another possibilitY.

2410
01:58:35,460 --> 01:58:38,160
And which one you think is gonna take 
place,

2411
01:58:38,161 --> 01:58:43,161
kind of depends on whether you're a 
glass is half empty or glass is half 

2412
01:58:43,161 --> 01:58:43,960
full type of person.
Yeah.

2413
01:58:43,961 --> 01:58:46,660
Well,
from your own personal point of view,

2414
01:58:46,661 --> 01:58:51,661
if you're listening to this,
don't rely on all those things to 

2415
01:58:51,661 --> 01:58:55,561
happen.
Just try to go out and do something 

2416
01:58:55,561 --> 01:58:55,561
about this for yourself.
And I think that's how it's really gonna

2417
01:58:55,970 --> 01:59:00,970
you know my,
my personal view is it's going to be a 

2418
01:59:00,970 --> 01:59:03,601
little of both actually.
So I think what's going to happen is 

2419
01:59:03,601 --> 01:59:07,410
you're going to start seeing some big 
changes on the more local grassroots 

2420
01:59:07,410 --> 01:59:09,220
level.
So we've already seen stuff like this.

2421
01:59:09,221 --> 01:59:14,221
Examples of be a.
there's a group called iora health and 

2422
01:59:14,221 --> 01:59:15,450
denver to primary care group and 
they're,

2423
01:59:15,490 --> 01:59:18,350
they're reversing type two diabetes with
health coaches now.

2424
01:59:18,370 --> 01:59:23,370
They still see the doctor,
but they work primarily with a health 

2425
01:59:23,370 --> 01:59:23,370
coach who does all those things that I 
just said.

2426
01:59:23,370 --> 01:59:25,240
I wasn't making that up.
They actually go to their house.

2427
01:59:25,270 --> 01:59:27,970
They do pantry clean outs,
they go shopping with them.

2428
01:59:28,480 --> 01:59:31,150
They teach them how to eat well,
but more than that,

2429
01:59:31,151 --> 01:59:32,230
they just provide the,
the.

2430
01:59:32,270 --> 01:59:35,740
They're like the accountability buddy.
You know the person they call them every

2431
01:59:35,740 --> 01:59:37,100
week they,
they visit their house.

2432
01:59:37,101 --> 01:59:38,080
So how are you doing?
You know,

2433
01:59:38,350 --> 01:59:39,300
how can I help?
And,

2434
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:44,520
and that person's totally empowered.
TheY make these changes and they're 

2435
01:59:44,520 --> 01:59:47,600
reversing it without,
without drugs or with a minimum of 

2436
01:59:47,600 --> 01:59:49,630
medication.
There's a mark hyman who's a doctor,

2437
01:59:50,080 --> 01:59:52,480
pioneer and functional medicine.
He recently,

2438
01:59:52,580 --> 01:59:57,580
um,
they tapped him to start the center for 

2439
01:59:57,580 --> 01:59:57,580
functional medicine at the cleveland 
clinic,

2440
01:59:57,580 --> 02:00:02,430
one of the most prestigious 
international medical institutions 

2441
02:00:02,430 --> 02:00:02,730
always on the forefront of the,
the,

2442
02:00:02,790 --> 02:00:06,220
the newest changes in medicine.
And when they first started,

2443
02:00:06,610 --> 02:00:11,610
they were in this tiny little space,
but within a few months they had like 

2444
02:00:11,610 --> 02:00:14,650
3000 patients on their wait list and 
they moved to a 17,000

2445
02:00:14,710 --> 02:00:18,520
square foot space and glickman tower,
which takes up the whole second floor of

2446
02:00:18,521 --> 02:00:20,080
this building and cleveland clinic.

2447
02:00:20,640 --> 02:00:25,640
And they've got patients from nine 
countries on the waitlist coming from 

2448
02:00:25,640 --> 02:00:26,880
all over the world to do the,
to do functional medicine because they,

2449
02:00:27,090 --> 02:00:32,090
you know,
people know that the system as it's set 

2450
02:00:32,090 --> 02:00:33,070
up isn't really effective for chronic 
disease.

2451
02:00:33,100 --> 02:00:34,420
It's fantastic.
I mean,

2452
02:00:34,421 --> 02:00:36,520
if I get hit by a bus,
I want to go to the hospital,

2453
02:00:36,580 --> 02:00:41,580
right?
I mean antibiotics revolutionize how we 

2454
02:00:41,580 --> 02:00:43,750
treat infections.
You have anesthesia made surgery like,

2455
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:46,510
you know,
imagine surgery without anesthesia.

2456
02:00:46,511 --> 02:00:51,511
It was like a bottle of booze.
I'm anti sepsis,

2457
02:00:51,551 --> 02:00:55,990
like cleaning the surgical theaters is 
dramatically reduced infections.

2458
02:00:55,991 --> 02:00:58,640
You've got radiology,
radiologic images,

2459
02:00:58,641 --> 02:01:03,641
so that's improved diagnosis of disease.
So conventional medicine is amazing and 

2460
02:01:03,641 --> 02:01:07,180
it's here to stay and we need it,
but it's just the wrong tool for the job

2461
02:01:07,410 --> 02:01:09,900
for long for chronic disease.
Nutrition,

2462
02:01:10,180 --> 02:01:11,390
for managing,
yeah,

2463
02:01:11,800 --> 02:01:14,080
using a hammer,
going around everywhere with a hammer,

2464
02:01:14,230 --> 02:01:16,000
you know,
expecting not to work.

2465
02:01:16,030 --> 02:01:21,030
Hammer works really well when you're 
pounding a nail and it doesn't work as 

2466
02:01:21,030 --> 02:01:22,150
well with a screw or you know,
with something else.

2467
02:01:22,690 --> 02:01:27,690
So I mean cleveland clinic,
it's just an amazing proof of concept 

2468
02:01:27,690 --> 02:01:29,410
for functional medicine.
Then rob wolf,

2469
02:01:29,411 --> 02:01:29,710
who,
you know,

2470
02:01:29,720 --> 02:01:30,910
you know,
we both know,

2471
02:01:31,330 --> 02:01:34,350
he dId some incredible work with the 
city of reno where,

2472
02:01:34,440 --> 02:01:36,480
and the first responders were,
they,

2473
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:40,070
they projected that just by doing this 
intervention.

2474
02:01:40,340 --> 02:01:42,700
So what happened was that the,
uh,

2475
02:01:42,770 --> 02:01:47,770
firefighters and police cops were,
were having heart attacks and strokes 

2476
02:01:48,320 --> 02:01:50,600
and because of the way the pension 
plans,

2477
02:01:50,640 --> 02:01:52,340
you know,
are set up if they have to,

2478
02:01:52,370 --> 02:01:55,130
if the city of reno has to medically 
retire these,

2479
02:01:55,190 --> 02:02:00,190
these people,
they're gonna spend like millions of 

2480
02:02:00,190 --> 02:02:01,100
dollars over the course of their 
lifetime taking care of them.

2481
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:03,500
so rob went in there with this other 
group,

2482
02:02:03,501 --> 02:02:06,140
specialty health,
you got them on a good,

2483
02:02:06,220 --> 02:02:07,610
you know,
paleo type of diet,

2484
02:02:07,611 --> 02:02:12,611
lower carb diet,
got them doing some more physical 

2485
02:02:12,611 --> 02:02:15,071
activity.
Well the estimate that they save the 

2486
02:02:15,071 --> 02:02:16,610
city of reno,
something like 25 or $30 million dollars

2487
02:02:16,970 --> 02:02:21,970
just with this simple intervention.
We're doing a pilot now with the 

2488
02:02:21,970 --> 02:02:25,241
berkeley fire department,
with our clinic with a similar kind of 

2489
02:02:25,241 --> 02:02:26,120
goal.
So I think you're going to see all these

2490
02:02:26,121 --> 02:02:31,121
kind of examples of things happening on 
local community level because you can 

2491
02:02:31,121 --> 02:02:32,120
make changes more quickly that way.

2492
02:02:32,600 --> 02:02:35,720
And then over time some of those things 
are going to scale up and you know,

2493
02:02:35,750 --> 02:02:40,750
we're going to start seeing them maybe 
on the state level or the local 

2494
02:02:40,750 --> 02:02:43,871
government level and then eventually at 
some point that's going to get attention

2495
02:02:43,941 --> 02:02:46,730
of people on the federal level who are 
looking around and going,

2496
02:02:46,731 --> 02:02:47,810
oh my god,
it's 20,

2497
02:02:47,910 --> 02:02:52,910
25 or 20,
30 healthcare expenditures are 35 or 40 

2498
02:02:52,910 --> 02:02:54,770
percent of gdp.
This is completely unsustAinable.

2499
02:02:54,771 --> 02:02:59,771
Like we're,
we're not even going to exist as a 

2500
02:02:59,771 --> 02:02:59,930
country in 25 years unless we do 
something about this.

2501
02:03:00,020 --> 02:03:03,260
So I kinda think it's gonna gonna gonna 
go like that.

2502
02:03:03,410 --> 02:03:04,820
Well,
I hope it goes towards the,

2503
02:03:04,840 --> 02:03:09,840
the,
the model of the cleveland clinic where 

2504
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:12,371
businesses sort of rise up and take 
advantage of this opportunity to get 

2505
02:03:12,371 --> 02:03:14,090
people healthy and to profit.
I mean,

2506
02:03:14,091 --> 02:03:16,430
it seems like that's the best way to 
make things happen.

2507
02:03:16,670 --> 02:03:17,860
Make,
makes,

2508
02:03:17,960 --> 02:03:20,210
make it a business or someone can profit
off of it,

2509
02:03:20,510 --> 02:03:25,510
you know,
and as long as it's affordable for the 

2510
02:03:25,510 --> 02:03:25,510
vast majority of people,
if it's not unreasonable.

2511
02:03:25,510 --> 02:03:26,150
Well that's the thing.
And,

2512
02:03:26,180 --> 02:03:31,180
you know,
rob has talked about this a lot for 

2513
02:03:31,180 --> 02:03:31,180
years,
um,

2514
02:03:31,180 --> 02:03:35,140
if you look at economies of scale and 
you looked at things like micro 

2515
02:03:35,140 --> 02:03:37,700
microprocessors and dna testing,
you know,

2516
02:03:37,701 --> 02:03:42,190
the first human genome sequence was like
a bill costs like $500,000,000

2517
02:03:42,200 --> 02:03:46,310
right now you can just go out and pay 
200 bucks to have the genome sequenced.

2518
02:03:46,311 --> 02:03:51,311
And you know,
microprocessors when they were first 

2519
02:03:51,311 --> 02:03:52,580
introduced to computers were as big as 
the room and um,

2520
02:03:52,610 --> 02:03:57,610
you know,
millions of dollars and now anyone can 

2521
02:03:57,610 --> 02:04:00,011
go buy a computer for a few hundred 
bucks while your phone is many times 

2522
02:04:00,011 --> 02:04:01,180
stronger than is from nasa and the 1960 
[inaudible].

2523
02:04:01,181 --> 02:04:03,300
But we don't see that kind of innovation
in healthcare.

2524
02:04:03,470 --> 02:04:07,700
Like we see expenses going up instead of
going down every year.

2525
02:04:07,701 --> 02:04:12,701
It gets more expensive.
I feel like there's a lot of hijacking 

2526
02:04:12,701 --> 02:04:12,830
going on with big money and big money 
in,

2527
02:04:12,831 --> 02:04:14,300
particularly in the pharmaceutical 
industry.

2528
02:04:14,301 --> 02:04:16,440
They don't want anything.
They didn't do this,

2529
02:04:16,790 --> 02:04:21,790
this,
this gravy train of money going right 

2530
02:04:21,790 --> 02:04:21,790
into their pockets when people have 
disease.

2531
02:04:21,790 --> 02:04:22,700
And that's the key point.
I mean,

2532
02:04:22,820 --> 02:04:23,480
uh,
rob,

2533
02:04:23,640 --> 02:04:24,750
uh,
we did a,

2534
02:04:24,990 --> 02:04:27,410
what we call it,
a rally to end chronic disease the other

2535
02:04:27,411 --> 02:04:32,411
night,
and then rob came and spoke and so did 

2536
02:04:32,411 --> 02:04:32,411
mark hyman from cleveland clinic and a 
few others,

2537
02:04:32,590 --> 02:04:37,570
and in rob's talk he mentioned that 
healthcare should essentially be free if

2538
02:04:37,680 --> 02:04:38,220
we used,

2539
02:04:38,220 --> 02:04:43,220
If,
if we allowed the same forces to that 

2540
02:04:43,220 --> 02:04:46,350
microprocessor.
Microprocessors go from being extremely 

2541
02:04:46,350 --> 02:04:46,350
expensive,
extremely cheap.

2542
02:04:46,350 --> 02:04:49,170
Dna testing go from being extremely 
expensive to extremely cheap.

2543
02:04:49,740 --> 02:04:53,130
If we allowed those same forces to work 
in on healthcare,

2544
02:04:53,160 --> 02:04:55,110
healthcare would be extremely 
affordable.

2545
02:04:56,340 --> 02:04:57,930
The problem is,
as you pointed out,

2546
02:04:57,990 --> 02:05:01,140
we have a lot of misaligned incentives,
so insurance companies,

2547
02:05:01,141 --> 02:05:06,141
for example,
they only benefit when the overall 

2548
02:05:06,141 --> 02:05:07,080
healthcare expenditures rise.
So the,

2549
02:05:07,120 --> 02:05:11,220
the more procedures are ordered,
tests are ordered,

2550
02:05:11,490 --> 02:05:14,070
you know,
treatments are prescribed.

2551
02:05:14,071 --> 02:05:16,350
The more they know the insurance company
benefit.

2552
02:05:16,351 --> 02:05:18,760
That seems counterintuitive to people 
because you would think that

2553
02:05:19,020 --> 02:05:24,020
paying for insurance and the insurance 
company is hoping that nothing goes 

2554
02:05:24,020 --> 02:05:24,940
wrong because then they'll have to pay 
out far more than that.

2555
02:05:25,030 --> 02:05:25,770
Paying.
Yeah.

2556
02:05:25,840 --> 02:05:30,840
There's a great book called catastrophic
care that I recommend for anyone by 

2557
02:05:30,840 --> 02:05:31,270
david goldhill for anyone who is 
interested in,

2558
02:05:31,271 --> 02:05:34,810
so it really pulls the curtain back on 
the whole system and how it's set up.

2559
02:05:35,410 --> 02:05:36,280
Then you've got,
of course,

2560
02:05:36,400 --> 02:05:39,100
pharmaceutical companies.
How is it set of the why?

2561
02:05:39,130 --> 02:05:43,450
Why do insurance companies benefit from,
from things going wrong?

2562
02:05:44,350 --> 02:05:45,970
They,
as the,

2563
02:05:46,240 --> 02:05:51,240
as the whole edifice or the whole system
of healthcare grows,

2564
02:05:51,550 --> 02:05:54,350
they benefit because they're,
uh,

2565
02:05:54,850 --> 02:05:59,850
their recipient.
They're involved in all of those 

2566
02:05:59,850 --> 02:05:59,850
transactions.
Oh,

2567
02:05:59,850 --> 02:06:03,610
okay.
And then you have big pharma that um,

2568
02:06:03,910 --> 02:06:06,130
is basically,
you know,

2569
02:06:06,131 --> 02:06:11,131
their incentive is to sell more drugs 
and they're for profit corporations and 

2570
02:06:11,131 --> 02:06:13,510
their duty is to make a profit for 
shareholders and that's how they do it.

2571
02:06:13,511 --> 02:06:17,950
And so I'm selling more drugs is not 
always in the same.

2572
02:06:18,110 --> 02:06:22,030
It aligned with the interest of patients
or even have doctors.

2573
02:06:22,180 --> 02:06:23,470
Well,
the real issue to me

2574
02:06:23,550 --> 02:06:28,550
that stands out as an example of that is
these stupid fucking commercials that 

2575
02:06:28,550 --> 02:06:32,451
they have for pharmaceutical drugs where
people are having the best time ever 

2576
02:06:32,451 --> 02:06:33,930
when you're looking at them and like,
how is this is so deceptive.

2577
02:06:33,931 --> 02:06:38,931
You're,
you're showing me like best case 

2578
02:06:38,931 --> 02:06:38,931
scenario,
grandpa running,

2579
02:06:38,931 --> 02:06:43,010
pushing the bike and the little kids 
laughing and everyone's having the time 

2580
02:06:43,010 --> 02:06:43,010
of their life like,
oh,

2581
02:06:43,010 --> 02:06:45,180
I want the time of my life.
How do I get in on that?

2582
02:06:45,280 --> 02:06:47,780
Tell the last 15 or 30 seconds,
which is like

2583
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:50,810
this drug may cause you know,
explosive diarrhea,

2584
02:06:50,811 --> 02:06:52,940
anal bleeding,
eyeballs fall out,

2585
02:06:52,941 --> 02:06:55,820
your feet don't work.
It's quite seriously.

2586
02:06:55,821 --> 02:07:00,821
Go on for like 15 seconds.
What was that one that we saw the other 

2587
02:07:00,821 --> 02:07:00,950
day?
Jake humira.

2588
02:07:01,040 --> 02:07:02,120
Yeah.
What is that stuff?

2589
02:07:02,150 --> 02:07:04,650
It was for members.
She said it's like 120 grand for crap.

2590
02:07:04,660 --> 02:07:08,090
Crappy titus and death is a side effect 
of that.

2591
02:07:08,091 --> 02:07:10,220
Drug death,
suicidal thoughts.

2592
02:07:10,221 --> 02:07:12,590
Contact your physician and he'll tell 
you a fuck yourself.

2593
02:07:14,120 --> 02:07:19,120
Wake him up.
Wake him up in the middle of the night 

2594
02:07:19,120 --> 02:07:19,120
here.
Give me some volume on this.

2595
02:07:19,120 --> 02:07:19,120
We could hear this when I was doing 
okay.

2596
02:07:19,220 --> 02:07:22,830
I thought I was doing okay too,
but I'm not looking at was.

2597
02:07:24,030 --> 02:07:29,030
She's managing humira is for people to 
still have symptoms of moderate to 

2598
02:07:29,030 --> 02:07:33,080
severe crones disease.
Clinical studies,

2599
02:07:33,081 --> 02:07:35,980
the majority of people on humira saw 
significant symptom

2600
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:40,980
relief,
maybe achieved remission can tell you 

2601
02:07:40,980 --> 02:07:41,740
what significant means.
Tuberculosis,

2602
02:07:41,800 --> 02:07:46,800
serious,
sometimes fatal infections and cancers 

2603
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:46,800
including lymphoma,
have happened,

2604
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:48,040
have blood,
liver and nervous system problems,

2605
02:07:48,070 --> 02:07:53,070
serious allergic reactions and new or 
worsening heart failure before 

2606
02:07:53,070 --> 02:07:53,140
treatment.
Get tested for tb.

2607
02:07:53,230 --> 02:07:58,230
Tell your doctor if you've been to areas
where certain fungal infections are 

2608
02:07:58,230 --> 02:08:01,231
common and if you've had tb.
Hepatitis b are prone to infections or 

2609
02:08:01,231 --> 02:08:02,590
have flu like symptoms or sores.
Don't start humira.

2610
02:08:02,620 --> 02:08:06,010
If you have an infection,
just managing your symptoms.

2611
02:08:06,840 --> 02:08:07,230
Okay,

2612
02:08:07,230 --> 02:08:12,230
kill it right there.
Why is that lady so fucking sweet and 

2613
02:08:12,230 --> 02:08:12,230
cheery?
What she's talking about?

2614
02:08:12,230 --> 02:08:16,610
Eminent death and the music just is not.
It is not fair and look,

2615
02:08:17,790 --> 02:08:22,790
the woman is on a tv set to like she's a
successful producer on a television set.

2616
02:08:23,360 --> 02:08:27,480
What a bizarre choice for what she does 
for a living,

2617
02:08:27,600 --> 02:08:31,770
like watcher will kill the volume,
but watch her wander around the office.

2618
02:08:31,771 --> 02:08:36,771
They're like,
who the fuck works a tv show like this 

2619
02:08:36,771 --> 02:08:38,070
is?
We're supposed to relate to this lady.

2620
02:08:38,250 --> 02:08:40,020
How manY people work on the set?
Look at her.

2621
02:08:40,021 --> 02:08:41,040
She's got a folder.
She goes,

2622
02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:44,000
she goes,
yeah,

2623
02:08:44,010 --> 02:08:46,770
because even though she has to do with 
crohn's disease,

2624
02:08:46,771 --> 02:08:51,771
what you eat,
she's going to fucking die in an 

2625
02:08:51,771 --> 02:08:52,260
explosive,
imploding,

2626
02:08:52,261 --> 02:08:55,290
rectal or disaster.
get an infection.

2627
02:08:55,291 --> 02:08:57,290
That would be totally,
you know,

2628
02:08:57,520 --> 02:09:02,520
not not a threat for you or anyone else,
but because they had taken a drug that 

2629
02:09:02,520 --> 02:09:03,630
globally suppresses their immune system 
can kill you.

2630
02:09:03,780 --> 02:09:04,410
Yeah.
That,

2631
02:09:04,470 --> 02:09:06,050
that whole thing,
like if you're,

2632
02:09:06,051 --> 02:09:07,400
you know,
if you have an infection,

2633
02:09:07,410 --> 02:09:08,250
don't take it.
Like,

2634
02:09:08,280 --> 02:09:09,570
what?
Wait a minute.

2635
02:09:09,750 --> 02:09:13,920
Aren't those pretty common,
the fuck are you saying like kind of try

2636
02:09:13,930 --> 02:09:16,920
not to get in fact don't get an 
infection while you're taking humira.

2637
02:09:16,921 --> 02:09:19,140
It's like,
do you ever try to get an infection?

2638
02:09:19,200 --> 02:09:21,720
I mean,
how do you not try to get an infection?

2639
02:09:21,780 --> 02:09:22,200
Yeah,
this,

2640
02:09:22,201 --> 02:09:26,550
but this is what kills me is that 
bizarre choice of her being some sort of

2641
02:09:26,551 --> 02:09:28,920
a director or producer of a television 
show,

2642
02:09:28,950 --> 02:09:30,510
like they were supposed to relate.
Well,

2643
02:09:30,511 --> 02:09:34,080
she is so successful and maybe maybe if 
you take humira,

2644
02:09:34,081 --> 02:09:36,750
you could also become a producer of a 
television.

2645
02:09:36,810 --> 02:09:41,810
There was another one abilify that 
killed and it was a antidepressant that 

2646
02:09:41,810 --> 02:09:44,850
you give to people that are suicidal 
while taking antidepressants.

2647
02:09:44,910 --> 02:09:46,160
Yeah,
like what?

2648
02:09:46,210 --> 02:09:46,530
Yeah.

2649
02:09:46,630 --> 02:09:47,100
Hey.
Hey.

2650
02:09:47,240 --> 02:09:48,970
Yeah,
let's talk about abilify.

2651
02:09:48,971 --> 02:09:53,971
It's one of,
I think it's the sixth or seventh most 

2652
02:09:53,971 --> 02:09:54,240
prescribed drug in the us.
It's an anti psychotic.

2653
02:09:54,630 --> 02:09:58,070
Okay.
So if those two things don't,

2654
02:09:58,140 --> 02:10:03,140
aren't,
are not resonating and there's a reason 

2655
02:10:03,140 --> 02:10:05,391
for that.
We don't have that many psychotics in 

2656
02:10:05,391 --> 02:10:06,010
this country where abilify could be,
you know,

2657
02:10:06,150 --> 02:10:08,670
only uses an anti psychotic.
Give me some volume.

2658
02:10:08,671 --> 02:10:12,840
Let's hear this carry on.
But other days I still struggled with my

2659
02:10:12,841 --> 02:10:14,940
depression.
I was handling it,

2660
02:10:15,120 --> 02:10:19,440
but sometimes it's just a cartoon.
I've been feeling stuck for a long time,

2661
02:10:19,910 --> 02:10:23,730
so I talked to my doctor and she added 
abilify to my antidepressant.

2662
02:10:23,970 --> 02:10:28,970
She said it could help with my 
depression and that some people had 

2663
02:10:28,970 --> 02:10:29,580
symptom improvement as early as one to 
two weeks.

2664
02:10:30,010 --> 02:10:32,580
I'm glad I talked to her.
I wiSh I'd done it sooner.

2665
02:10:32,900 --> 02:10:34,400
Now I feel more in control

2666
02:10:34,430 --> 02:10:38,600
of my new for everyone.
Doctor,

2667
02:10:38,601 --> 02:10:43,601
if your depression worsens or you have 
unusual changes in behavior or thoughts 

2668
02:10:43,601 --> 02:10:47,291
of suicide,
antidepressants can increase these in 

2669
02:10:47,291 --> 02:10:47,291
children,
teens,

2670
02:10:47,291 --> 02:10:47,750
and young adults.
elderly dementia,

2671
02:10:47,751 --> 02:10:51,320
patients taking abilify have an 
increased risk of death or stroke.

2672
02:10:51,590 --> 02:10:55,580
Call your doctor if you have high fever,
stiff muscles and confusion to address a

2673
02:10:55,581 --> 02:11:00,581
possible life threatening condition,
or if you have uncontrollable muscle 

2674
02:11:00,581 --> 02:11:03,911
movements as these could become 
permanent blood sugar has been reported 

2675
02:11:03,911 --> 02:11:07,721
with abilify and medicines like it and 
in extreme cases can lead to coma or 

2676
02:11:07,721 --> 02:11:11,411
death.
Other risks include increased 

2677
02:11:11,411 --> 02:11:13,211
cholesterol,
weight gain decreases in white blood 

2678
02:11:13,211 --> 02:11:13,211
cells,
which can be serious,

2679
02:11:13,211 --> 02:11:14,150
dizziness on standing,
seizures,

2680
02:11:14,240 --> 02:11:16,880
trouble swallowing,
and impaired judgement or motor skills.

2681
02:11:17,100 --> 02:11:20,970
The person was always hanging over me.
That bitch,

2682
02:11:21,120 --> 02:11:25,250
a depressed depression is a concern.
If you take this shit.

2683
02:11:25,520 --> 02:11:29,960
Most of that commercial was telling 
start where they're talking to,

2684
02:11:29,961 --> 02:11:33,830
you cut the segment of the commercial 
where the lady comes out,

2685
02:11:33,831 --> 02:11:36,590
the doctor comes out,
show where the lady doctor is,

2686
02:11:36,591 --> 02:11:41,591
because that's like halfway in the lady 
doctor comes out at third and two thirds

2687
02:11:44,151 --> 02:11:47,030
is the lady doctor say you're gonna 
fucking die.

2688
02:11:47,070 --> 02:11:47,240
Wait

2689
02:11:47,250 --> 02:11:52,250
is break this down because this is a 
drug that's added to a prescription of 

2690
02:11:52,250 --> 02:11:56,400
someone who's already taking any 
depressants to prevent suicidal thoughts

2691
02:11:56,401 --> 02:12:01,401
or.
But then one of the first side effects 

2692
02:12:01,401 --> 02:12:01,590
they said to look out for it.
Suicidal thoughts?

2693
02:12:01,820 --> 02:12:02,970
Yeah.
What?

2694
02:12:03,550 --> 02:12:08,550
maybe there'll be a third drug that 
people who are already on 

2695
02:12:08,550 --> 02:12:11,721
antidepressants and abilify can take for
the suicidal thoughts that abilify 

2696
02:12:11,881 --> 02:12:15,580
wasn't able to get rid of from the 
original antidepressant.

2697
02:12:15,581 --> 02:12:20,581
Yeah.
Maybe we're just being cynical and 

2698
02:12:20,581 --> 02:12:21,940
depressed.
We just need to trust in that cartoon 

2699
02:12:21,940 --> 02:12:23,760
lady with a great voice.
Is amnesia.

2700
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,790
So loss.
I mean this is a good example.

2701
02:12:27,090 --> 02:12:28,950
We've all heard this term evidence 
based,

2702
02:12:28,980 --> 02:12:29,460
right?
yeah,

2703
02:12:29,520 --> 02:12:34,520
and the idea is that conventional 
medicine is evidenced based and 

2704
02:12:34,520 --> 02:12:34,520
everything else is not.
Well,

2705
02:12:34,520 --> 02:12:37,290
that's total bs because this an abilify 
is a great example.

2706
02:12:37,291 --> 02:12:39,750
It's an anti psychotic,
that's what it was approved for,

2707
02:12:39,870 --> 02:12:42,420
for psychosis and yes,
we have a lot of,

2708
02:12:42,720 --> 02:12:46,830
I mean recent events indicate that we do
have quite a few psych psych,

2709
02:12:47,250 --> 02:12:49,000
psychotic people,
um,

2710
02:12:49,510 --> 02:12:51,090
mass shootings,
et cetera,

2711
02:12:51,330 --> 02:12:53,640
but not that many,
you know,

2712
02:12:53,641 --> 02:12:58,641
not enough to make abilify that the 
seventh leading a drug on a sales basis.

2713
02:12:59,790 --> 02:13:01,590
That's insane.
That's an insane number.

2714
02:13:01,920 --> 02:13:06,920
So what abilify is prescribed off label,
so off label means a way of using the 

2715
02:13:07,261 --> 02:13:12,261
drug that has never been a studier or 
approved by the fda for that particular 

2716
02:13:12,261 --> 02:13:17,091
purpose.
So it's using a drug in a way that was 

2717
02:13:17,091 --> 02:13:17,760
not originally studied.
How is that legal?

2718
02:13:18,060 --> 02:13:23,060
It's legal.
Doctors have the authority to prescribe 

2719
02:13:23,060 --> 02:13:24,150
medications off label as long as they're
fda approved,

2720
02:13:24,840 --> 02:13:28,110
fda approved for something that's so 
vast.

2721
02:13:28,111 --> 02:13:31,800
Majority of abilify prescriptions 
therefore are label,

2722
02:13:31,830 --> 02:13:35,940
which means they've never been studied 
or shown to be safe or effective for the

2723
02:13:35,941 --> 02:13:38,100
conditions that it's being prescribed 
for.

2724
02:13:38,460 --> 02:13:41,880
So your doctor could legally prescribe 
you birth control pills?

2725
02:13:42,390 --> 02:13:42,660
Yeah,

2726
02:13:43,360 --> 02:13:47,620
I mean it would be frowned upon and 
maybe if they did that enough and it was

2727
02:13:47,621 --> 02:13:48,730
causing problems,
they would,

2728
02:13:48,790 --> 02:13:50,980
they would have to justify why they were
doing it,

2729
02:13:51,040 --> 02:13:52,870
but it's the missing key to abilify

2730
02:13:52,930 --> 02:13:57,910
for men,
gay female birth control pills,

2731
02:13:57,911 --> 02:13:58,750
like,
oh wow,

2732
02:13:58,751 --> 02:13:59,200
look at this.

2733
02:13:59,720 --> 02:14:04,720
Well,
it also means they can use it in a 

2734
02:14:04,720 --> 02:14:04,720
population that hasn't been studied for.
So for example,

2735
02:14:04,721 --> 02:14:06,730
a drug has been studied and approved for
adults.

2736
02:14:06,731 --> 02:14:08,830
Did you see that?
It said not safe,

2737
02:14:08,950 --> 02:14:13,950
you know,
it shouldn't be used for children and 

2738
02:14:13,950 --> 02:14:13,950
the elderly because it's never been 
studied,

2739
02:14:13,950 --> 02:14:15,640
but that doesn't mean it's not being 
prescribed for children or the elderly.

2740
02:14:15,641 --> 02:14:18,460
It's still definitely is.
But you know,

2741
02:14:18,670 --> 02:14:23,670
antidepressants have been shown to cause
to suicidal ideation in adolescents and 

2742
02:14:23,670 --> 02:14:27,991
teenagers in particular,
and yet they are still often used in 

2743
02:14:27,991 --> 02:14:27,991
that,
in that group,

2744
02:14:27,991 --> 02:14:30,430
even though they were never studied or 
approved for that

2745
02:14:30,530 --> 02:14:32,180
population.
What is this one,

2746
02:14:32,181 --> 02:14:33,020
jamie?
A bill,

2747
02:14:33,140 --> 02:14:36,500
a bill top selling year seven

2748
02:14:37,040 --> 02:14:38,880
below the top selling.
Sorry.

2749
02:14:38,881 --> 02:14:41,580
It's a toxin while you're driving.
It's not the number seven.

2750
02:14:41,581 --> 02:14:43,080
It's a silly me.

2751
02:14:45,360 --> 02:14:48,690
So the top selling drug is an anti 
psychotic,

2752
02:14:48,810 --> 02:14:50,260
is that real?
Is real,

2753
02:14:50,300 --> 02:14:52,530
but is it still the top selling drug 
will whatever,

2754
02:14:52,590 --> 02:14:57,590
let's not even look.
But in 2014 it was the top selling drug 

2755
02:14:57,590 --> 02:15:02,320
that is crazy,
has become the best selling drug in the 

2756
02:15:02,671 --> 02:15:03,750
United States.

2757
02:15:05,530 --> 02:15:10,530
The alarms about the dangerous and 
sometimes deadly side effects of anti 

2758
02:15:10,530 --> 02:15:14,071
psychotics affecting children and the 
elderly among others have been mounting 

2759
02:15:14,071 --> 02:15:14,071
for years.

2760
02:15:14,690 --> 02:15:17,600
Wow,
that's terrifying.

2761
02:15:17,890 --> 02:15:22,890
Yeah.
And many of these symptoms could be 

2762
02:15:22,890 --> 02:15:26,711
directly related to gut biome gut 
bacteria and you might be able to nip it

2763
02:15:28,461 --> 02:15:31,520
in the bud with a change in diet,
uh,

2764
02:15:31,610 --> 02:15:35,960
with addressing the sedentary lifestyle 
rigorous exercise.

2765
02:15:36,320 --> 02:15:38,450
So let,
let me tell you asked all these things.

2766
02:15:38,451 --> 02:15:43,451
Meantime,
it seems like what you're prescribing 

2767
02:15:43,451 --> 02:15:43,451
like,
oh,

2768
02:15:43,451 --> 02:15:43,451
come on.
It can't be that easy.

2769
02:15:43,451 --> 02:15:48,310
Let me tell you a story.
It's actually the first chapter in my 

2770
02:15:48,310 --> 02:15:51,041
book.
It's about a kid named leo that I 

2771
02:15:51,041 --> 02:15:51,041
treated my clinic furious back.
He's eight years old,

2772
02:15:51,041 --> 02:15:52,190
eight years old.
When he came to see me,

2773
02:15:53,350 --> 02:15:58,350
we're like a rack when they,
when they came to the office because 

2774
02:15:58,350 --> 02:15:58,350
they,
you know,

2775
02:15:58,350 --> 02:16:00,020
he had,
they were just totally worn down.

2776
02:16:00,380 --> 02:16:05,380
He would throw these epic tantrums where
he'd be screaming and crying and riding 

2777
02:16:05,691 --> 02:16:09,440
on the floor for just the most random 
stuff,

2778
02:16:09,441 --> 02:16:14,441
like trying to get his shoes tied is 
they were going out the door or you 

2779
02:16:14,441 --> 02:16:17,461
know,
not cutting the crust off his bread 

2780
02:16:17,461 --> 02:16:19,270
sandwich and just the right way or 
getting a stay on his favorite tee 

2781
02:16:19,270 --> 02:16:20,240
shirt.
He had a super limited diet.

2782
02:16:20,270 --> 02:16:25,270
He had only a handful of foods.
All of them processed and refined like 

2783
02:16:25,270 --> 02:16:25,270
toaster waffles,
bread,

2784
02:16:25,270 --> 02:16:26,510
crackers,
cookies,

2785
02:16:26,540 --> 02:16:28,300
etc.
Um,

2786
02:16:28,630 --> 02:16:33,630
you know,
they were concerned about nutrient 

2787
02:16:33,630 --> 02:16:35,041
deficiency,
but every time they tried to 

2788
02:16:35,041 --> 02:16:35,041
reintroduce,
like to introduce a different food,

2789
02:16:35,041 --> 02:16:38,701
he would go ballistic and they didn't 
have the energy to fight him at every 

2790
02:16:38,701 --> 02:16:38,701
meal.

2791
02:16:38,701 --> 02:16:40,870
He was really rigid about his behavior 
and environment.

2792
02:16:40,871 --> 02:16:45,190
So like everything had to be just right.
If the toys in his room or range in just

2793
02:16:45,191 --> 02:16:45,910
the right way,
he,

2794
02:16:45,970 --> 02:16:49,270
he'd fly off the handle desks in this 
classroom.

2795
02:16:49,400 --> 02:16:50,920
You know,
just the right way.

2796
02:16:50,921 --> 02:16:55,921
He'd fly off the handle.
He was really anxious in unfamiliar 

2797
02:16:55,921 --> 02:16:57,460
environments,
so it's hard for them to leave the house

2798
02:16:57,461 --> 02:17:00,610
for even a few hours,
much less travel or go on vacations.

2799
02:17:01,030 --> 02:17:02,050
I mean,
this seems extreme,

2800
02:17:02,051 --> 02:17:04,990
but there are a lot of kids with these 
kinds of behavioral disorders now.

2801
02:17:04,991 --> 02:17:06,120
He was not,
you know,

2802
02:17:06,130 --> 02:17:08,560
he's not alone.
Um,

2803
02:17:08,650 --> 02:17:13,650
so they took him to see doctors locally 
and they started with the primary care 

2804
02:17:13,661 --> 02:17:18,661
doctor,
then went to psychiatrist and then 

2805
02:17:18,661 --> 02:17:20,641
several behavioral disorder specialists 
actually down here at usc or ucla and 

2806
02:17:23,800 --> 02:17:24,370
uh,
you know,

2807
02:17:24,371 --> 02:17:29,371
first diagnosed on the autism spectrum 
and then eventually ocd and something 

2808
02:17:29,371 --> 02:17:33,841
called sensory processing disorder,
which is like on the autism spectrum 

2809
02:17:33,841 --> 02:17:34,960
where they're really sensitive to scent 
scent,

2810
02:17:35,020 --> 02:17:36,850
sense input,
touch,

2811
02:17:36,980 --> 02:17:38,170
you know,
sound cetera.

2812
02:17:39,070 --> 02:17:40,600
So,
um,

2813
02:17:41,470 --> 02:17:42,940
they,
the doctors,

2814
02:17:43,040 --> 02:17:43,780
uh,
you know,

2815
02:17:43,781 --> 02:17:45,820
they were relieved at first to have 
these diagnoses,

2816
02:17:45,821 --> 02:17:49,030
but very quickly it became apparent that
they were just labeled sort of symptoms.

2817
02:17:49,031 --> 02:17:52,210
it wasn't anything that actually gave 
them information about what to do.

2818
02:17:52,630 --> 02:17:55,600
And then the doc when asked the doctor 
what the treatment was,

2819
02:17:55,780 --> 02:18:00,040
the answer was medication.
So they first started with adderall,

2820
02:18:00,041 --> 02:18:05,041
which you mentioned earlier,
then rhydlin both stimulants and then 

2821
02:18:05,041 --> 02:18:08,791
eventually antidepressants,
which again have not really been 

2822
02:18:08,791 --> 02:18:11,581
approved.
It's safe or effective in kids and they 

2823
02:18:11,581 --> 02:18:12,550
did help at least a little bit with some
of the symptoms,

2824
02:18:12,610 --> 02:18:15,520
but then he got a lot of brutal side 
effects,

2825
02:18:16,330 --> 02:18:18,400
got pain,
dry mouth,

2826
02:18:18,720 --> 02:18:20,680
irritability,
headaches,

2827
02:18:20,681 --> 02:18:23,350
and the worst thing was severe sleep 
disruption.

2828
02:18:23,440 --> 02:18:25,210
And he had two younger brothers and 
sisters.

2829
02:18:25,211 --> 02:18:27,130
So it was parents definitely didn't need
more of that.

2830
02:18:27,970 --> 02:18:30,790
And the crazy thing throughout this 
entire period,

2831
02:18:31,030 --> 02:18:36,030
not one of his doctors even hinted at 
the possibility that something in its 

2832
02:18:36,030 --> 02:18:39,661
diet or like a disrupted gut microbiome 
or nutrient deficiency could even be 

2833
02:18:39,661 --> 02:18:40,630
contributing to his symptoms.

2834
02:18:40,660 --> 02:18:43,630
Nobody even brought that up.
And that's not the exception.

2835
02:18:43,631 --> 02:18:45,880
That's the rule.
Um,

2836
02:18:46,030 --> 02:18:47,170
so,
you know,

2837
02:18:47,230 --> 02:18:49,210
his parents weren't thrilled about,
uh,

2838
02:18:50,980 --> 02:18:55,980
I mean,
they weren't thrilled about medicating 

2839
02:18:55,980 --> 02:18:58,351
him,
but they did it because they had no 

2840
02:18:58,351 --> 02:18:59,911
other option.
And nobody suggested that it could be 

2841
02:18:59,911 --> 02:18:59,911
anything other than just,
you know,

2842
02:19:00,010 --> 02:19:02,110
something wrong with their,
their son.

2843
02:19:02,740 --> 02:19:06,010
But uh,
fortunately one of his mom's friends had

2844
02:19:06,400 --> 02:19:09,550
sent a couple of articles from my blog.
One was on the gut brain axis,

2845
02:19:09,551 --> 02:19:14,551
which we've been talking about.
Another was on all of the underlying 

2846
02:19:14,551 --> 02:19:17,020
causes of behavioral disorders in kids.
So they brought him to my clinic.

2847
02:19:17,560 --> 02:19:22,560
Um,
we did a whole bunch of testing as I do 

2848
02:19:22,560 --> 02:19:22,560
with all my new patients.
And not surprisingly,

2849
02:19:22,560 --> 02:19:24,850
we found he had a disrupted gut 
microbiome.

2850
02:19:24,880 --> 02:19:27,860
He had cbo,
bacterial overgrowth in the intestine.

2851
02:19:28,370 --> 02:19:33,370
He had a non celiac,
gluten sensitivity and gluten was in 

2852
02:19:33,370 --> 02:19:33,920
almost every food he was eating.

2853
02:19:34,190 --> 02:19:39,190
But he also had an intolerance of some 
other proteins like dairy and soy and 

2854
02:19:39,190 --> 02:19:40,670
corn and buckwheat,
which were in the toaster waffles.

2855
02:19:40,671 --> 02:19:42,590
He was eating every night.
Yeah,

2856
02:19:42,591 --> 02:19:44,400
deficiencies of vitamin d,
b,

2857
02:19:44,401 --> 02:19:48,200
12 fully and iron because he was eating 
just flower,

2858
02:19:48,260 --> 02:19:52,340
basically flour and sugar.
And he had high levels of arsenic,

2859
02:19:52,400 --> 02:19:56,240
which is a heavy metal because the only 
other beverage he would drink aside from

2860
02:19:56,241 --> 02:19:57,860
water was rice,
milk and rice.

2861
02:19:57,861 --> 02:20:01,520
Milk has been shown to have higher 
levels of arsenic,

2862
02:20:01,521 --> 02:20:06,521
so if a kid's just pounding rice milk,
they could actually start to develop 

2863
02:20:06,521 --> 02:20:07,490
levels of arsenic.
that could be problematic because that's

2864
02:20:07,491 --> 02:20:10,280
crazy because a lot of people think of 
rice milk as a healthy beverage.

2865
02:20:10,281 --> 02:20:11,290
Right.
But,

2866
02:20:11,660 --> 02:20:12,790
so we start,
you know,

2867
02:20:12,791 --> 02:20:15,680
we started treating him,
which wasn't easy because of his ocd,

2868
02:20:15,681 --> 02:20:20,681
like tendencies.
It was really hard to get him to change 

2869
02:20:20,681 --> 02:20:20,681
his diet.

2870
02:20:20,681 --> 02:20:24,280
Um,
so we just started focusing just on 

2871
02:20:24,280 --> 02:20:26,801
those mechanisms that I talked about,
getting him some more nutrients and 

2872
02:20:26,801 --> 02:20:27,070
treating his god and,
and dealing,

2873
02:20:27,200 --> 02:20:32,200
You know,
trying to get some of those things out 

2874
02:20:32,200 --> 02:20:33,881
of his food initially,
just switching those brands of toaster 

2875
02:20:33,881 --> 02:20:37,931
waffles so that at least they were made 
from stuff that he wasn't clearly 

2876
02:20:37,931 --> 02:20:40,871
reacting to.
And then gradually over time shifting 

2877
02:20:40,871 --> 02:20:40,970
within,
within several weeks,

2878
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:46,600
he was having fewer tantrums.
He was less set off by the things that 

2879
02:20:46,600 --> 02:20:48,380
would have done that before.
About four months into the treatment,

2880
02:20:48,440 --> 02:20:51,140
his teacher called home from school and 
was like,

2881
02:20:52,040 --> 02:20:53,420
where's leo?
You know,

2882
02:20:53,450 --> 02:20:55,160
what have you done with leo?
And who's this guy?

2883
02:20:55,161 --> 02:21:00,161
Who was sending the school,
it has plates because it had been 

2884
02:21:00,161 --> 02:21:01,300
horrific for her as as his teacher at 
school and you know,

2885
02:21:01,340 --> 02:21:06,340
to the point where it's parents often 
had to come pick him up and bring them 

2886
02:21:06,340 --> 02:21:06,340
home from school because he was so 
disruptive.

2887
02:21:07,100 --> 02:21:11,210
Then I talked to leo's mom maybe six,
seven months into the treatment.

2888
02:21:11,420 --> 02:21:13,190
By then we had to follow up,
test back.

2889
02:21:13,220 --> 02:21:17,080
A lot of the issues that we set out to 
address had been resolved is dieted,

2890
02:21:17,180 --> 02:21:22,180
expanded significantly.
He was eating foods that he would have 

2891
02:21:22,180 --> 02:21:24,380
thrown against the wall just a few 
months before he was more tolerant,

2892
02:21:24,710 --> 02:21:29,710
more affectionate.
I'm less controlling and rigid and just 

2893
02:21:29,710 --> 02:21:33,371
better adjusted kid overall and at the 
end of that time his mom said something 

2894
02:21:34,521 --> 02:21:37,820
that really struck me and it's really.
It's why I wrote the book.

2895
02:21:38,030 --> 02:21:40,910
She said,
why don't more doctors know about this?

2896
02:21:41,240 --> 02:21:46,240
There's so many kids out there like leo 
who are suffering from these kinds of 

2897
02:21:46,240 --> 02:21:46,880
behavioral disorders,
but neither their parents,

2898
02:21:46,881 --> 02:21:51,881
northern doctors or even looking at this
other stuff like the diet and the gut 

2899
02:21:51,881 --> 02:21:56,441
and all these things so it's not even a 
consideration and that's why I want to 

2900
02:21:56,441 --> 02:22:00,620
get this book out there because it's 
like we can't know and and,

2901
02:22:00,680 --> 02:22:02,680
and treat what we're not even looking 
for.

2902
02:22:02,780 --> 02:22:05,270
What's crazY is what you're saying is 
revolutionary,

2903
02:22:05,271 --> 02:22:05,960
but it's not.

2904
02:22:06,500 --> 02:22:07,780
Right.
It's common sense,

2905
02:22:07,781 --> 02:22:09,050
right?
I mean it's food,

2906
02:22:09,290 --> 02:22:10,030
but the,
you've,

2907
02:22:10,070 --> 02:22:15,070
you essentially restructured the 
ecosystem of this child's body and,

2908
02:22:15,130 --> 02:22:18,470
and brought them back to homeostasis.
You brought them back to some sort of,

2909
02:22:19,130 --> 02:22:24,130
some normal functioning.
Some and this poor kid was living with a

2910
02:22:25,261 --> 02:22:26,250
diet that

2911
02:22:26,250 --> 02:22:29,850
a giant percentage of our country is,
Is consuming.

2912
02:22:30,210 --> 02:22:35,210
A lot of kids are eating sugar cereals 
in the morning and peanut butter and 

2913
02:22:35,210 --> 02:22:39,561
jelly sandwiches and just white bread 
and sugar is lunch packs with the 

2914
02:22:41,601 --> 02:22:42,780
lunchable.
Although,

2915
02:22:44,450 --> 02:22:49,450
yeah,
it's even worse in kids because there's 

2916
02:22:49,450 --> 02:22:50,400
this idea that big food has been very 
successful.

2917
02:22:50,401 --> 02:22:53,730
It perpetuating that.
Kids need special kids foods.

2918
02:22:53,940 --> 02:22:55,680
You know,
they can't just eat what we're eating as

2919
02:22:55,681 --> 02:22:57,900
adults.
We have to prepare kids meals.

2920
02:22:57,901 --> 02:22:59,910
You go to a restaurant and there's the 
kid's menu,

2921
02:23:00,340 --> 02:23:05,340
go to a great restaurant that has meat 
and vegetables and all this stuff on 

2922
02:23:05,340 --> 02:23:05,730
what is the kid's menu have on it?
Chicken fingers,

2923
02:23:05,940 --> 02:23:08,160
cheese,
pasta with nothing on it.

2924
02:23:08,161 --> 02:23:10,430
Just total crap bullshit.
And the idea,

2925
02:23:10,440 --> 02:23:12,300
you know,
when we go out with my daughter,

2926
02:23:12,360 --> 02:23:14,820
they always bring us the kid's menu and 
my daughter's like,

2927
02:23:14,850 --> 02:23:15,870
no,
I don't need to see that.

2928
02:23:15,870 --> 02:23:18,510
I'm ordering off this menu.
And it's like,

2929
02:23:18,540 --> 02:23:23,540
yeah,
we don't need breakfast cereal or pop 

2930
02:23:23,540 --> 02:23:23,540
tarts who need this craft kits just need
to eat.

2931
02:23:23,540 --> 02:23:28,250
It's even more important for kids to eat
well than it is for us because their 

2932
02:23:28,250 --> 02:23:29,910
brain is still developing.
Their body's still developing.

2933
02:23:30,390 --> 02:23:35,390
So yeah,
I mean someday we'll go to the doctor 

2934
02:23:35,390 --> 02:23:35,390
and you have a chronic,
you know,

2935
02:23:35,390 --> 02:23:39,380
something like this.
The first questions are going to be 

2936
02:23:39,380 --> 02:23:39,380
around,
what are you eating?

2937
02:23:39,380 --> 02:23:40,350
How are you living?
Oh wait,

2938
02:23:40,351 --> 02:23:42,630
let's do some tests to find out how your
gut is.

2939
02:23:42,690 --> 02:23:45,180
Let's do some tests to see if you're 
nutrient deficient.

2940
02:23:45,181 --> 02:23:50,181
Let's.
Let's actually look at the causes 

2941
02:23:50,181 --> 02:23:52,011
instead of just assuming that every 
chronic disease is a deficiency of a 

2942
02:23:52,011 --> 02:23:53,350
medication.
Yeah.

2943
02:23:53,940 --> 02:23:56,490
That's basically how it's a problem.
You have high cholesterol,

2944
02:23:56,491 --> 02:24:01,491
you have a stat and deficiency,
so we better correct that by giving you 

2945
02:24:01,491 --> 02:24:01,491
this.

2946
02:24:01,491 --> 02:24:02,130
You have high blood pressure,
you have a diarrhetic deficiency.

2947
02:24:02,131 --> 02:24:03,510
We're going to give you that.
You have depression,

2948
02:24:03,511 --> 02:24:06,420
you have an antidepressant deficiency,
so we're going to give you that drug.

2949
02:24:07,830 --> 02:24:10,200
Basically how it's looked at,
that is how it's looked at.

2950
02:24:10,230 --> 02:24:14,040
It's crazy that what you're saying is 
eat food,

2951
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:16,560
eat real food,
eat food.

2952
02:24:16,980 --> 02:24:17,930
I mean,
I think if people,

2953
02:24:18,100 --> 02:24:23,100
if we ate real food,
like probably that could shave off like 

2954
02:24:23,100 --> 02:24:27,770
a couple trillion dollars from the 
health care and how much more effective 

2955
02:24:27,770 --> 02:24:30,540
would we be at whatever we're doing?
How much healthier would people be?

2956
02:24:30,541 --> 02:24:32,410
How much happier would people be?
yeah.

2957
02:24:32,450 --> 02:24:37,450
It's not just about health in that 
narrow sense of the lIke the absence of 

2958
02:24:37,450 --> 02:24:41,301
symptoms or the body.
we're talking about your ability to 

2959
02:24:41,301 --> 02:24:42,330
perform at work,
your ability to relate to your kids,

2960
02:24:42,420 --> 02:24:43,920
to your partner,
you know,

2961
02:24:43,950 --> 02:24:48,950
wonder how much of the antidepressant,
like the people that are prescribed are 

2962
02:24:48,950 --> 02:24:51,420
people that are experiencing depression,
has to do with their diet.

2963
02:24:52,620 --> 02:24:54,690
I would say quite a high percentage.
Again,

2964
02:24:54,691 --> 02:24:59,691
I don't want to be.
I think there are situational factors 

2965
02:24:59,691 --> 02:24:59,691
that cause depression.
I mean,

2966
02:24:59,691 --> 02:25:04,660
you know,
for someone who is poor and lives in an 

2967
02:25:04,660 --> 02:25:05,850
economically and socially depressed area
and is fighting,

2968
02:25:05,940 --> 02:25:08,520
you know,
systemic oppression,

2969
02:25:08,610 --> 02:25:11,110
there's good reason to be depressed 
situation.

2970
02:25:11,130 --> 02:25:16,130
So nevertheless a,
given what we understand now about this 

2971
02:25:16,130 --> 02:25:20,631
inflammatory model of depression,
it's also true that that is the very 

2972
02:25:21,031 --> 02:25:22,980
least going to exacerbate it and make 
it,

2973
02:25:23,440 --> 02:25:28,440
but in some cases may be the primary 
driver of depression and I can't tell 

2974
02:25:28,440 --> 02:25:31,180
you how many patients I've had who've 
had depression that they thought was.

2975
02:25:31,240 --> 02:25:34,960
IT was something wrong with them.
There's something broken about them.

2976
02:25:35,370 --> 02:25:36,610
you know,
they just,

2977
02:25:36,640 --> 02:25:39,430
they're not cut out for this world.
They don't fit in here.

2978
02:25:39,431 --> 02:25:41,410
That sort of thing.
And then we go in,

2979
02:25:41,440 --> 02:25:42,430
we see,
oh,

2980
02:25:42,490 --> 02:25:47,490
you've got a severe,
be 12 or fully deficiency that affects 

2981
02:25:47,490 --> 02:25:47,490
your neurotransmitter levels.

2982
02:25:47,490 --> 02:25:49,060
Oh,
you've got a disrupted gut microbiome.

2983
02:25:49,061 --> 02:25:50,040
Oh you're,
you've got,

2984
02:25:50,500 --> 02:25:52,600
you know,
a blood sugar abnormalities.

2985
02:25:52,601 --> 02:25:53,620
Oh,
you're hypo thyroid.

2986
02:25:53,621 --> 02:25:56,830
We know 20 or 30 percent of patients 
with depression have hypo thyroid.

2987
02:25:56,831 --> 02:25:58,810
So just correcting that could,
could correct it.

2988
02:25:59,200 --> 02:26:04,200
Can we address all Those things?
All of a sudden that person's no longer 

2989
02:26:04,200 --> 02:26:04,720
depressed.
And I've had people say things like,

2990
02:26:05,200 --> 02:26:10,200
oh my god,
for the last 20 years I thought 

2991
02:26:10,200 --> 02:26:10,200
something was wrong with me.
I thought I was broken.

2992
02:26:10,200 --> 02:26:14,521
I thought like I really.
It was me and something was really 

2993
02:26:14,521 --> 02:26:15,730
wrong.
It's a crazy word too.

2994
02:26:15,731 --> 02:26:20,731
The problem with depression is that it's
a diagnosis and that if you just said 

2995
02:26:20,731 --> 02:26:21,910
feel bad,
feel bad,

2996
02:26:21,940 --> 02:26:23,530
would not be like,
oh,

2997
02:26:23,531 --> 02:26:25,640
he's been diagnosed with feel bad,
you know.

2998
02:26:25,660 --> 02:26:28,690
But that's essential with depression is 
it's so blanket.

2999
02:26:28,750 --> 02:26:31,600
It can cover a host of different 
neurological issues,

3000
02:26:31,601 --> 02:26:36,601
physiological issues or behavioral 
issues that are there because of your 

3001
02:26:36,601 --> 02:26:37,540
environment and your life experiences.

3002
02:26:37,630 --> 02:26:40,390
Absolutely.
And that was not an unintentional thing,

3003
02:26:40,391 --> 02:26:43,330
joe,
that was a drug companies creating it as

3004
02:26:43,331 --> 02:26:48,331
a disease to that because diseases 
require medications to be fixed in our 

3005
02:26:48,640 --> 02:26:51,070
culture and this happens across the 
board and it's not,

3006
02:26:51,470 --> 02:26:52,300
you know,
you know,

3007
02:26:52,301 --> 02:26:54,670
the story of viagara and how that was 
developed.

3008
02:26:54,900 --> 02:26:57,670
It was some sort of a blood pressure 
medication.

3009
02:26:57,671 --> 02:26:58,540
Correct.
Right.

3010
02:26:58,660 --> 02:27:00,510
And uh,
hey,

3011
02:27:00,710 --> 02:27:01,430
jack,
jackpot.

3012
02:27:02,050 --> 02:27:03,730
Yeah.
So they found like,

3013
02:27:03,731 --> 02:27:05,920
okay,
this isn't working very well for what we

3014
02:27:05,921 --> 02:27:07,060
designed it for,
but,

3015
02:27:07,180 --> 02:27:10,810
but it's got some pretty interesting 
effects and so,

3016
02:27:10,960 --> 02:27:15,960
but they knew it wasn't enough to just 
then go out there and start selling it 

3017
02:27:15,960 --> 02:27:15,960
for two.
Got to say,

3018
02:27:15,960 --> 02:27:18,340
hey,
here's a drug that will help you know,

3019
02:27:18,400 --> 02:27:20,220
make you perform better,
right.

3020
02:27:20,260 --> 02:27:21,760
Bedroom.
That wasn't enough.

3021
02:27:22,240 --> 02:27:27,240
What they had to do is create a disease 
that it could be prescribed for because 

3022
02:27:27,341 --> 02:27:27,700
that's.

3023
02:27:27,880 --> 02:27:28,800
And then,
and,

3024
02:27:28,880 --> 02:27:30,590
and you know how they did that,
they hired a,

3025
02:27:30,700 --> 02:27:35,700
an advertising agency and the ad agency 
came up with the term erectile 

3026
02:27:35,700 --> 02:27:37,270
dysfunction.
No way.

3027
02:27:37,271 --> 02:27:38,980
And created this.
No way.

3028
02:27:38,981 --> 02:27:43,981
Absolutely.
It's publicly available information 

3029
02:27:43,981 --> 02:27:46,480
agency named a disease.
this is not the only case where this has

3030
02:27:46,481 --> 02:27:50,140
happened,
so they create this disease category and

3031
02:27:50,141 --> 02:27:55,141
then they get it out into the world and 
they advertise it to people and to 

3032
02:27:55,141 --> 02:27:58,240
doctors and so all of a sudden people 
are going in with a magazine or like,

3033
02:27:59,170 --> 02:28:02,440
this is me,
I have erectile dysfunction,

3034
02:28:02,860 --> 02:28:07,860
and I know now there's a drug called 
viagara that I need because I have 

3035
02:28:07,860 --> 02:28:09,520
erectile dysfunction and the doctor has 
seen the.

3036
02:28:09,580 --> 02:28:12,430
They have their own brochure.
They pull out their brochure and it says

3037
02:28:12,431 --> 02:28:14,500
erectile dysfunction.
Here are the signs and symptoms.

3038
02:28:14,501 --> 02:28:15,070
Okay,
check,

3039
02:28:15,071 --> 02:28:15,520
check,
check,

3040
02:28:15,521 --> 02:28:16,090
check.
Yes.

3041
02:28:16,091 --> 02:28:18,730
This patient's got erectile ed.
So here's a drug.

3042
02:28:19,630 --> 02:28:22,310
Is it legal for an advertising

3043
02:28:22,310 --> 02:28:25,490
agency to name a disorder?
well,

3044
02:28:25,550 --> 02:28:30,550
I'll tell you that it's illegal in every
single country in the world except for 

3045
02:28:30,550 --> 02:28:33,530
New Zealand and the United States to 
advertise drugs to to consumers.

3046
02:28:33,970 --> 02:28:36,640
Please New Zealand.
Be the first change.

3047
02:28:36,800 --> 02:28:41,800
Please turn around,
make us look terrible at first because 

3048
02:28:41,800 --> 02:28:45,420
this is the result.
Conscious is the result of allowing 

3049
02:28:45,420 --> 02:28:48,320
drugs to be advertised is that you get 
advertising agencies creating conditions

3050
02:28:48,350 --> 02:28:51,560
that then require drugs to be treated.
That is fucking amazing.

3051
02:28:51,710 --> 02:28:54,800
What else has been named by advertising 
agencies?

3052
02:28:55,070 --> 02:28:56,630
Off the top of my head,
I don't know,

3053
02:28:56,631 --> 02:28:58,550
but I will.
Next time I'm on this show,

3054
02:28:58,551 --> 02:29:01,160
I'll definitely have a list for you.
God damn.

3055
02:29:01,190 --> 02:29:04,340
I can't believe that that's legal.
it's legal.

3056
02:29:04,580 --> 02:29:05,600
And you know,
I,

3057
02:29:05,610 --> 02:29:07,880
there's a,
another book I read a while back,

3058
02:29:08,210 --> 02:29:13,210
um,
and the quote in the book was really 

3059
02:29:13,210 --> 02:29:13,520
revealing.
It was by the ceo of merck,

3060
02:29:13,521 --> 02:29:15,980
which is one of the biggest 
pharmaceutical companies in the world.

3061
02:29:16,580 --> 02:29:17,780
And again,
I'm going To paraphrase,

3062
02:29:17,781 --> 02:29:22,670
I don't remember the exact words,
but the gist of it was the real money in

3063
02:29:22,671 --> 02:29:24,710
drugs is in selling them to healthy 
people.

3064
02:29:25,940 --> 02:29:28,280
So he hit,
he had realized that,

3065
02:29:28,370 --> 02:29:33,370
you know,
we basically saturated the market of 

3066
02:29:33,370 --> 02:29:33,410
medications that can be used to treat 
sick people.

3067
02:29:33,890 --> 02:29:38,890
So the only way we can continue to grow 
and expand is to come up with ways to 

3068
02:29:38,890 --> 02:29:42,791
sell drugs to healthy people.
When did they first started prescribing 

3069
02:29:42,791 --> 02:29:43,090
ended up presence?
Uh,

3070
02:29:43,120 --> 02:29:48,120
well the,
the ssri is I think go back to the 

3071
02:29:48,120 --> 02:29:48,120
eighties,
late eighties,

3072
02:29:48,120 --> 02:29:52,991
early nineties,
but they had other kinds of 

3073
02:29:52,991 --> 02:29:55,301
antidepressants before that called try 
cyclic antidepressants and other types 

3074
02:29:55,301 --> 02:29:55,880
of medications.
So they've been around for awhile,

3075
02:29:56,630 --> 02:30:00,170
but I mean,
my point is like this creation of ed,

3076
02:30:00,440 --> 02:30:05,440
erectile dysfunction as a disease was a 
way of kind of selling drugs to healthy 

3077
02:30:05,991 --> 02:30:07,680
people because they,
they,

3078
02:30:07,690 --> 02:30:12,690
they basically shifted them from being 
healthy people that otherwise wouldn't 

3079
02:30:12,690 --> 02:30:15,140
see themselves as someone who needed a 
drug to people who are not who,

3080
02:30:15,430 --> 02:30:16,760
who now have a condition.

3081
02:30:17,210 --> 02:30:18,920
Yeah.
From what I understand,

3082
02:30:18,921 --> 02:30:23,921
pro vigil,
that was the initial creation of 

3083
02:30:23,921 --> 02:30:27,041
provigil.
They were trying to come up with a 

3084
02:30:27,041 --> 02:30:27,041
performance enhancing drug for,
for um,

3085
02:30:27,041 --> 02:30:30,500
cognitive function and they couldn't 
just sell it as such,

3086
02:30:30,501 --> 02:30:33,110
so they had to come up with some sort of
a reason why people need it.

3087
02:30:33,290 --> 02:30:35,210
So they went with narcolepsy.
Right.

3088
02:30:36,100 --> 02:30:37,250
And then you,
I mean,

3089
02:30:37,251 --> 02:30:40,280
you have people who have been arguing 
that stat and should be put in the water

3090
02:30:40,281 --> 02:30:41,500
supply.
Why?

3091
02:30:41,680 --> 02:30:44,060
Yeah.
There literally blew the fuck.

3092
02:30:44,061 --> 02:30:49,061
Says that as a doctor in the uk,
that guy's a monster who lit not cause 

3093
02:30:49,061 --> 02:30:53,380
eating a salad right now.
Fucking monster put it in the water 

3094
02:30:53,691 --> 02:30:54,900
supply.
Qmap is up.

3095
02:30:55,300 --> 02:30:57,350
That's poison.
He's seriously.

3096
02:30:57,560 --> 02:31:00,080
I advocated for that and it wasn't a 
joke.

3097
02:31:00,081 --> 02:31:05,081
It wasn't an exaggeration.
This is a few years back.

3098
02:31:06,981 --> 02:31:07,670
I can't.
I can't.

3099
02:31:07,760 --> 02:31:12,560
I have a blog article about it because 
his argument was these,

3100
02:31:12,561 --> 02:31:17,561
you know,
these drugs are so effective for 

3101
02:31:17,561 --> 02:31:19,631
reducing the risk of heart disease that 
we should just be giving them to 

3102
02:31:19,631 --> 02:31:20,220
everybody despite whether they

3103
02:31:20,340 --> 02:31:25,340
want to take them or not because it 
doesn't that don't they seriously 

3104
02:31:25,340 --> 02:31:26,280
disrupt performance.
Physical performance.

3105
02:31:26,570 --> 02:31:31,570
The bigger question is whether statens 
actually extend lifespan in people 

3106
02:31:31,570 --> 02:31:36,160
without preexisting heart disease and a 
lot of the research suggests that not 

3107
02:31:36,290 --> 02:31:40,150
that the answer to that question is no 
or very in a,

3108
02:31:40,151 --> 02:31:45,151
in an almost non insignificant way and 
then you have to balance that with the 

3109
02:31:45,151 --> 02:31:46,890
potential side effects.
Like the increased risk of diabetes,

3110
02:31:46,891 --> 02:31:51,891
particularly in women with and now we 
have 100 million people with diabetes 

3111
02:31:51,891 --> 02:31:53,650
and then the muscle fatigue and myopathy
and that,

3112
02:31:53,660 --> 02:31:56,490
that sort of thing.
But uh,

3113
02:31:56,491 --> 02:31:58,350
yeah,
I mean I think this is,

3114
02:31:58,580 --> 02:32:03,580
I mean we go off on this when we are 
talking about misaligned incentives and 

3115
02:32:03,580 --> 02:32:05,160
all of these things we've been talking 
about are just examples of how what's in

3116
02:32:05,161 --> 02:32:10,161
the best interests of a drug company de 
is not necessarily in the best interest 

3117
02:32:10,161 --> 02:32:12,320
of us as patients or as for dr.

3118
02:32:12,440 --> 02:32:14,820
When he goes back to what you were 
saying about teeth,

3119
02:32:14,910 --> 02:32:17,970
tooth decay and fluoride in the water,
right?

3120
02:32:18,030 --> 02:32:21,060
Like how much tooth decay is really 
because of our diet.

3121
02:32:21,120 --> 02:32:25,110
And it's not because of fluoride is not 
because Florida is not good for you.

3122
02:32:25,410 --> 02:32:30,410
Well you look especially in large 
quantities and you can get away with it 

3123
02:32:30,410 --> 02:32:30,410
in some of the quantities.
It's in our water supply.

3124
02:32:30,410 --> 02:32:32,880
But from what I understand,
it's not really.

3125
02:32:32,910 --> 02:32:33,990
We don't need it.
So,

3126
02:32:33,991 --> 02:32:38,991
I know this might sound controversial,
but do we think that our 100 gatherer 

3127
02:32:40,141 --> 02:32:45,141
ancestors were brushing their teeth 
twice a day and flossing twice a day 

3128
02:32:45,141 --> 02:32:45,720
now?
They probably had horrible breath.

3129
02:32:46,110 --> 02:32:47,670
Well,
here'S the thing,

3130
02:32:47,810 --> 02:32:52,810
um,
there is an oral microbiome just like 

3131
02:32:52,810 --> 02:32:55,851
there is a microbiome in the gut and 
it's what's likely and,

3132
02:32:55,941 --> 02:32:59,130
and they've archeologists have know that
when they,

3133
02:32:59,131 --> 02:33:04,131
you know,
when they uncover remains from the 

3134
02:33:04,131 --> 02:33:04,131
traditional,
you know,

3135
02:33:04,131 --> 02:33:05,430
our ancestors,
our paleolithic ancestors,

3136
02:33:05,431 --> 02:33:10,431
they have great healthy jaws and teeth 
and not egyptians.

3137
02:33:11,350 --> 02:33:12,180
You know,
about that.

3138
02:33:12,181 --> 02:33:13,770
Well,
that was civilization already.

3139
02:33:13,771 --> 02:33:15,600
Yeah.
Grinding food,

3140
02:33:15,630 --> 02:33:20,630
talking about further back,
further back in our history prior to 

3141
02:33:20,630 --> 02:33:22,140
agriculture right now,
none of that.

3142
02:33:22,141 --> 02:33:25,530
And so what that suggests is that,
you know,

3143
02:33:25,710 --> 02:33:30,710
look,
I brushed my teeth and floss and not 

3144
02:33:30,710 --> 02:33:31,290
suggesting that people shouldn't now and
that there hasn't been some improvement,

3145
02:33:31,291 --> 02:33:32,580
but that,
you know,

3146
02:33:32,581 --> 02:33:37,581
the fact that weston price went around 
to all these traditional cultures and 

3147
02:33:37,581 --> 02:33:40,500
found that they had beautiful healthy 
teeth and wide dental arches.

3148
02:33:40,501 --> 02:33:43,710
They weren't brushing their teeth twice 
a day and flossing twice a day,

3149
02:33:44,130 --> 02:33:49,130
but they had root underlying foundation 
of health and a healthy microbiome,

3150
02:33:49,441 --> 02:33:54,441
not only in their gut but in oral 
microbiome that lead to healthy teeth.

3151
02:33:54,570 --> 02:33:58,380
Even without that kind of dental hygiene
and dental care.

3152
02:33:58,830 --> 02:34:00,660
And uh,
you know,

3153
02:34:00,890 --> 02:34:04,590
there are now oral probiotics,
dental probiotics,

3154
02:34:04,920 --> 02:34:09,000
which are chewable tablets that you can 
just,

3155
02:34:09,020 --> 02:34:14,020
you know,
you pop one in your mouth after you 

3156
02:34:14,020 --> 02:34:14,020
brush your teeth,
you chew.

3157
02:34:14,020 --> 02:34:16,290
And I've had patients who had been 
having recurring cavities,

3158
02:34:16,320 --> 02:34:18,230
dental issues,
period per

3159
02:34:18,520 --> 02:34:23,520
periodontal periodontal issues that just
by chewing one of these dental 

3160
02:34:24,011 --> 02:34:29,011
probiotics twice a day,
I've had like a complete reversal on 

3161
02:34:29,011 --> 02:34:29,011
their dental health where,
you know,

3162
02:34:29,011 --> 02:34:31,990
they go from having like a cavity every 
time they go to the dentist to having no

3163
02:34:31,991 --> 02:34:32,830
cavities at all

3164
02:34:32,910 --> 02:34:37,910
because that was,
that's one of those woo subjects where 

3165
02:34:37,910 --> 02:34:37,910
people go,
oh,

3166
02:34:37,910 --> 02:34:38,680
you fucking crystal hippie.
You know,

3167
02:34:38,681 --> 02:34:40,430
when you start talking about fluoride in
the water.

3168
02:34:40,640 --> 02:34:42,130
But do we really.
I mean,

3169
02:34:42,140 --> 02:34:47,140
we definitely need to somehow or another
clean the water of bacteria and treat 

3170
02:34:47,961 --> 02:34:50,540
the water so that it doesn't have 
pollutants in it,

3171
02:34:50,570 --> 02:34:52,910
but that can be done with filtration 
systems.

3172
02:34:52,911 --> 02:34:54,200
You know,
people in the wild,

3173
02:34:54,590 --> 02:34:56,660
not in the wild,
meAning like the toumani,

3174
02:34:56,661 --> 02:35:00,260
but people that live in camps for months
at a time,

3175
02:35:00,261 --> 02:35:02,600
like friends of mine,
they go on these back country trips.

3176
02:35:03,020 --> 02:35:06,090
They use water filters to use.
They'll take a walk,

3177
02:35:06,290 --> 02:35:11,290
they'll take like a wallow that like an 
elk have been stomping around and muddy 

3178
02:35:11,721 --> 02:35:16,721
water and they'll put this water through
this filtration system and make it so 

3179
02:35:16,721 --> 02:35:20,171
you can drink it and there's stary pens.
They have these pens that you could spin

3180
02:35:21,531 --> 02:35:26,531
the pan around the water for a 
predetermined period of time and it 

3181
02:35:26,531 --> 02:35:26,531
kills everything.
That's bacteria.

3182
02:35:26,750 --> 02:35:31,750
All the bacteria in the water.
There's a bunch of different filtration 

3183
02:35:31,750 --> 02:35:34,781
systems,
pumps that they use on creeks to keep 

3184
02:35:34,781 --> 02:35:36,230
beaver fever.
What's that stuff called?

3185
02:35:36,440 --> 02:35:38,180
Giardia.
Giardia from beaver.

3186
02:35:38,181 --> 02:35:43,181
Shit in the water.
So this all can be done without 

3187
02:35:43,181 --> 02:35:43,181
chemicals.
that was my point.

3188
02:35:43,181 --> 02:35:47,080
Yeah,
so the chemicals that we have in the 

3189
02:35:47,080 --> 02:35:47,450
water there,
they might be terrible for you.

3190
02:35:47,630 --> 02:35:51,590
They're not necessary and especially in 
terms of flUoride,

3191
02:35:51,591 --> 02:35:52,970
it might be completely misguided.

3192
02:35:53,740 --> 02:35:57,220
Have you read,
I forget the book on this big thick book

3193
02:35:57,221 --> 02:35:59,620
on fluoride.
Bryson,

3194
02:35:59,621 --> 02:36:01,120
I think this is the last name of the 
author.

3195
02:36:01,420 --> 02:36:02,560
It's a yellow cover.
no,

3196
02:36:02,561 --> 02:36:06,490
I haven't read it.
I think he mentioned something about how

3197
02:36:06,540 --> 02:36:08,850
in this this comes up in other contexts 
too,

3198
02:36:08,950 --> 02:36:10,090
um,
where,

3199
02:36:10,300 --> 02:36:15,300
uh,
companies that have something that's 

3200
02:36:15,300 --> 02:36:16,660
toxic that they would otherwise have to 
pay for to dispose of.

3201
02:36:16,710 --> 02:36:21,710
I have figured out ways to actually sell
that stuff to the food industry or to 

3202
02:36:21,850 --> 02:36:25,090
another industry that,
that then puts it in some products.

3203
02:36:25,091 --> 02:36:28,150
So industrial seed oils like soybean 
oil,

3204
02:36:28,151 --> 02:36:29,830
cottonseed oil,
those kinds of things.

3205
02:36:29,831 --> 02:36:32,050
Originally were,
were not considered foods.

3206
02:36:32,110 --> 02:36:37,110
They were waste products from ag 
agriculture from text growing those 

3207
02:36:37,110 --> 02:36:38,460
crops.
And then the,

3208
02:36:38,480 --> 02:36:43,480
the brilliance of those that have those 
companies at that time was figuring out 

3209
02:36:43,480 --> 02:36:48,391
a way to turn those things that would 
have otherwise been seen as waste into 

3210
02:36:48,391 --> 02:36:50,020
like a food product that they could then
sell.

3211
02:36:50,020 --> 02:36:54,370
And make money off of really those,
those,

3212
02:36:54,400 --> 02:36:57,100
those are amongst the worst because you 
know,

3213
02:36:57,250 --> 02:36:59,380
those are ubiquitous in the american 
diet,

3214
02:36:59,381 --> 02:37:01,990
like if you pick up any package food,
you're going to see,

3215
02:37:01,991 --> 02:37:02,980
you know,
soybean oil,

3216
02:37:02,981 --> 02:37:04,100
corn oil,
corn oil,

3217
02:37:04,150 --> 02:37:05,410
cottonseed oil,
et cetera.

3218
02:37:05,411 --> 02:37:09,430
There's all these highly processed and 
refined omega six vegetable oils.

3219
02:37:09,500 --> 02:37:14,500
And those vegetable oils are very 
difficult for your body to process well 

3220
02:37:14,500 --> 02:37:14,650
there.
First of all,

3221
02:37:14,651 --> 02:37:16,790
they're almost completely devoid of 
nutrients.

3222
02:37:16,791 --> 02:37:17,330
They have,
you know,

3223
02:37:17,420 --> 02:37:22,420
some of them have vitamin e,
but they have almost no other nutrients 

3224
02:37:22,420 --> 02:37:22,420
at all.
Um,

3225
02:37:22,420 --> 02:37:26,860
and historically humans had consumed a 
balance of omega six and omega three 

3226
02:37:27,950 --> 02:37:30,130
oils that was somewhere between,
you know,

3227
02:37:30,170 --> 02:37:34,160
one to one ratio or maybe a four to one 
in favor of omega six.

3228
02:37:34,250 --> 02:37:35,370
But,
uh,

3229
02:37:35,510 --> 02:37:39,230
the amount of omega six oils that we 
consume today is much higher,

3230
02:37:39,260 --> 02:37:44,260
you know,
sometimes like a 20 to one ratio of 

3231
02:37:44,260 --> 02:37:44,260
omega six to omega three.

3232
02:37:44,260 --> 02:37:48,670
And this is a controversial topic.
There was just a research study 

3233
02:37:48,670 --> 02:37:51,611
published that was a,
seemed to suggest that these oils 

3234
02:37:51,611 --> 02:37:54,140
actually may not be as harmful as as we 
thought they were,

3235
02:37:54,200 --> 02:37:57,260
but I haven't had a chance to read the 
full text of the study yet.

3236
02:37:57,261 --> 02:37:59,690
And you have to look at the overall 
weight of the evidence,

3237
02:37:59,691 --> 02:38:04,691
you know,
if you've got 40 studies showing that 

3238
02:38:04,691 --> 02:38:05,840
there are harmful and then one that 
shows that they're not well.

3239
02:38:06,050 --> 02:38:11,050
Okay,
but you got to consider that in the 

3240
02:38:11,050 --> 02:38:11,050
whole context.
Yeah.

3241
02:38:11,050 --> 02:38:15,370
Yeah.
And you got to find out who funded that 

3242
02:38:15,370 --> 02:38:16,700
study and there are a lot of questions 
to ask and whether even the studies said

3243
02:38:16,701 --> 02:38:18,230
what,
what people say it said,

3244
02:38:18,231 --> 02:38:20,390
which is often not the case when you 
look into it.

3245
02:38:20,480 --> 02:38:25,480
That fluoride one's really freaking me 
out now that we're talking about it 

3246
02:38:25,480 --> 02:38:25,690
because I wonder like,
how do you,

3247
02:38:25,760 --> 02:38:28,100
how would you ever stop that?
What's the.

3248
02:38:28,670 --> 02:38:33,670
Hasn't there been connections or 
correlations between fluoride and low 

3249
02:38:33,670 --> 02:38:33,670
iq?

3250
02:38:35,090 --> 02:38:36,590
That sounds familiar,
but again,

3251
02:38:36,591 --> 02:38:38,690
it's not topic I've looked into in 
detail.

3252
02:38:38,691 --> 02:38:41,240
So I don't want to say something that's 
not correct,

3253
02:38:41,300 --> 02:38:43,730
but um,
that's the difference in you and me.

3254
02:38:47,830 --> 02:38:52,830
I think I heard fluoride exposure in 
utero linked to your iq in bed study 

3255
02:38:53,021 --> 02:38:55,390
says,
can you go scroll up a little bit there,

3256
02:38:55,450 --> 02:38:56,660
jamie?
Let me.

3257
02:38:56,670 --> 02:38:57,330
They'll.
Yeah.

3258
02:38:57,490 --> 02:39:02,490
Increased levels of prenatal fluoride 
exposure may be associated with lower 

3259
02:39:02,490 --> 02:39:05,290
cognitive function in children.
New study says published tuesday and the

3260
02:39:05,291 --> 02:39:10,291
journal of environmental health 
perspectives evaluated nearly 300 sets 

3261
02:39:10,291 --> 02:39:14,581
of mothers and children in Mexico and 
tested children twice for cognitive 

3262
02:39:14,581 --> 02:39:18,571
development over the course of 12 years.
Florida is not added to public water 

3263
02:39:18,571 --> 02:39:22,711
supplies in Mexico,
but people are exposed to it through 

3264
02:39:22,711 --> 02:39:24,100
naturally occurring fluoride in water 
and fluoridated salt and supplements.

3265
02:39:24,400 --> 02:39:25,030
Wow.

3266
02:39:25,630 --> 02:39:26,210
yeah.
And the,

3267
02:39:26,240 --> 02:39:29,080
I mean this highlight something else 
that we haven't talked about much at all

3268
02:39:29,081 --> 02:39:31,470
in terms of aspect of the modern 
environment.

3269
02:39:31,500 --> 02:39:35,050
It's problematic,
which is toxins being one of them,

3270
02:39:35,051 --> 02:39:37,600
but also things like mercury,
bisphenol a,

3271
02:39:37,601 --> 02:39:40,720
bpa which is in the plastic water 
bottles,

3272
02:39:40,930 --> 02:39:43,150
seats,
and what's this?

3273
02:39:43,300 --> 02:39:44,970
Thousands of us locales.
We're lit.

3274
02:39:45,060 --> 02:39:47,290
We're lead poisoning is worse than.
yeah.

3275
02:39:47,520 --> 02:39:51,820
Yeah.
Did you see that new study on India?

3276
02:39:52,980 --> 02:39:55,780
I think it was new delhi,
I forget what,

3277
02:39:55,781 --> 02:39:58,150
but air pollution in India

3278
02:39:58,430 --> 02:40:01,490
at an all time high and they show these 
photographs of this city and

3279
02:40:01,670 --> 02:40:04,160
it is insane.
You just can't see anything.

3280
02:40:04,161 --> 02:40:07,430
I can't see anything.
You can't see a building 100 yards ahead

3281
02:40:07,431 --> 02:40:07,930
of you.
Yeah.

3282
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:13,000
So I mean air pollution has been linked 
to obesity and cardiovascular disease 

3283
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:13,040
and stuff.
You wouldn't even think,

3284
02:40:13,050 --> 02:40:14,100
not just respiratory,

3285
02:40:14,400 --> 02:40:19,400
you know,
things like systemic inflammatory 

3286
02:40:19,400 --> 02:40:21,890
conditions.
And the problem with toxins is our 

3287
02:40:21,890 --> 02:40:25,860
initial understanding of toxic toxicity 
was only like acute toxicity.

3288
02:40:25,861 --> 02:40:30,861
Like what happens if you get so much 
mercury in your body so quickly that it 

3289
02:40:30,861 --> 02:40:34,581
causes like an acute problem and we 
assume that um,

3290
02:40:35,160 --> 02:40:35,640
you know,
if,

3291
02:40:35,700 --> 02:40:38,520
if you don't see acute toxicity then 
there's no problem.

3292
02:40:38,521 --> 02:40:43,521
Like There's nothing in between acute 
toxicity and just normal that we know 

3293
02:40:43,521 --> 02:40:46,320
now that like there was a really 
interesting study a couple years back.

3294
02:40:46,321 --> 02:40:51,321
I wrote about this on my blog.
I think the title was something like 

3295
02:40:51,321 --> 02:40:52,050
mercury,
a fish consumption and kids.

3296
02:40:52,750 --> 02:40:55,750
Look at this video.
The video came out today,

3297
02:40:55,751 --> 02:40:57,700
this is a really bad,
uh,

3298
02:40:57,730 --> 02:41:02,730
air pollution caused car accident pile 
up in new delhi that these people are 

3299
02:41:02,730 --> 02:41:06,991
trying to get people out of the car and 
just a couple of seconds it's just like 

3300
02:41:06,991 --> 02:41:09,040
a snow storm here in America and other 
cars and it comes slamming into them.

3301
02:41:09,350 --> 02:41:14,350
Oh,
they're going to tell them to hurry up 

3302
02:41:14,350 --> 02:41:14,350
and get the fuck out of there before 
another one comes in.

3303
02:41:14,350 --> 02:41:14,530
It happens like three or four times in a
row right here.

3304
02:41:15,520 --> 02:41:16,390
Oh my god.

3305
02:41:17,480 --> 02:41:22,480
So these.
So these people are standing there and 

3306
02:41:22,480 --> 02:41:23,360
see,
oh my god,

3307
02:41:23,840 --> 02:41:24,770
mrs.
On a freeway.

3308
02:41:25,070 --> 02:41:27,530
Oh my gosh.
Oh my god.

3309
02:41:27,580 --> 02:41:30,260
Now they gotta get the fuck out because 
another one's coming.

3310
02:41:31,780 --> 02:41:33,950
It's insane.
Oh my god.

3311
02:41:34,850 --> 02:41:39,850
This is all just air pollution there.
Oh my god.

3312
02:41:40,910 --> 02:41:42,310
This is incredible.
This is like,

3313
02:41:42,500 --> 02:41:45,770
they're in a fog on a mountain road and 
were on the highway.

3314
02:41:46,730 --> 02:41:49,970
this is what is the name of this video?
So you can watch on twitter.

3315
02:41:49,971 --> 02:41:54,971
I define on twitter litter going around 
the dassault right before the show 

3316
02:41:54,971 --> 02:41:54,971
starts.
That's why I was like,

3317
02:41:55,220 --> 02:41:57,980
oh my god.
New delhi car accident,

3318
02:41:58,430 --> 02:41:59,450
uh,
air pollution.

3319
02:41:59,460 --> 02:42:01,400
Oh my god,
this is insane.

3320
02:42:01,460 --> 02:42:02,870
And they're telling these people get out
of the car.

3321
02:42:03,210 --> 02:42:08,210
what do you do?
Because if you go up to try to warn 

3322
02:42:08,210 --> 02:42:09,090
people it's they can't see you there 
either.

3323
02:42:09,180 --> 02:42:14,180
Yeah.
And then what if someone takes a turn 

3324
02:42:14,180 --> 02:42:14,180
and it hits those people to the side?
Oh god,

3325
02:42:14,180 --> 02:42:15,240
this is horrific.
That's about where it ends right here.

3326
02:42:15,270 --> 02:42:16,170
Oh my god.

3327
02:42:17,620 --> 02:42:19,030
Yeah.
So I mean,

3328
02:42:19,120 --> 02:42:23,170
these are like the mercury thing,
you know,

3329
02:42:23,171 --> 02:42:24,910
the idea for a long time was,
oh,

3330
02:42:25,150 --> 02:42:27,280
if your blood levels below 10 parts per 
million,

3331
02:42:27,281 --> 02:42:28,600
you're fine.
There's no evidence,

3332
02:42:28,640 --> 02:42:29,250
you know,
there's no,

3333
02:42:29,290 --> 02:42:34,290
there's no issue.
So this new study came out and they 

3334
02:42:34,290 --> 02:42:35,530
looked at kids and they looked at 
cortisol levels,

3335
02:42:35,560 --> 02:42:39,820
which and in and inflammatory 
inflammatory markers and they found that

3336
02:42:39,821 --> 02:42:44,821
kids that,
that had mercury levels that were even 

3337
02:42:44,821 --> 02:42:45,430
as,
as low as a one,

3338
02:42:45,670 --> 02:42:50,670
so you know,
almost 10 times lower than the level of 

3339
02:42:50,670 --> 02:42:54,061
concern had higher levels of cortisol 
and higher levels of inflammatory 

3340
02:42:54,061 --> 02:42:57,260
markers and they and they.
So that totally turned things on the,

3341
02:42:57,261 --> 02:42:58,030
on,
on their head.

3342
02:42:58,031 --> 02:43:00,160
It was like all of a sudden,
you know,

3343
02:43:00,580 --> 02:43:05,580
lower levels of the talks of these 
toxins than we thought were problematic 

3344
02:43:05,580 --> 02:43:08,080
are actually problematic and they,
when they dove in and look deeper,

3345
02:43:08,081 --> 02:43:10,270
they found a,
you know,

3346
02:43:10,271 --> 02:43:14,170
some of the kids who were affected had 
certain genetic polymorphisms,

3347
02:43:14,171 --> 02:43:19,171
like there was something that made them 
more susceptible or maybe they had 

3348
02:43:19,171 --> 02:43:22,621
nutrient deficiencies that made them 
less able to detoxify the mercury as 

3349
02:43:22,631 --> 02:43:24,130
they normally should be able to.

3350
02:43:24,790 --> 02:43:28,240
And you know,
what further complicates it is that,

3351
02:43:28,830 --> 02:43:33,830
uh,
the symptoms that you see with high 

3352
02:43:33,830 --> 02:43:34,090
levels of toxin can actually be 
different at low levels.

3353
02:43:34,420 --> 02:43:39,420
So let's say researchers design a study 
to see the toxic effects of mercury 

3354
02:43:39,420 --> 02:43:43,651
when,
when the exposure is severe and they're 

3355
02:43:43,651 --> 02:43:47,281
looking for certain studies and then 
they start lowering the dose of mercury 

3356
02:43:47,281 --> 02:43:51,300
to see when those effects go away,
they will completely miss the effects 

3357
02:43:52,001 --> 02:43:57,001
that are caused by the low doses of 
mercury because they're are different 

3358
02:43:57,001 --> 02:43:57,160
than the effects that they were studying
at the higher doses.

3359
02:43:57,910 --> 02:44:02,910
So this caused a problem for years where
it was assumed that the low doses were 

3360
02:44:02,910 --> 02:44:07,051
harmless because they weren't observing 
the same effects they saw at the high 

3361
02:44:07,051 --> 02:44:09,790
doses and now they know this and so 
they've redesigned studies to look,

3362
02:44:09,850 --> 02:44:12,220
just cast a wider net and see what's 
happening.

3363
02:44:12,220 --> 02:44:17,220
And sure enough at those lower levels of
toxins they're seeing all kinds of 

3364
02:44:17,220 --> 02:44:19,330
effects that are actually in some cases,
opposite of the effect that you see with

3365
02:44:19,331 --> 02:44:23,740
the high dose of the toxin.
Have you adjusted like where you live or

3366
02:44:23,741 --> 02:44:25,780
anything because of all this?
Uh,

3367
02:44:25,781 --> 02:44:26,830
well I,
you know,

3368
02:44:26,831 --> 02:44:29,290
when we're,
we just bought a house a couple of years

3369
02:44:29,290 --> 02:44:31,000
ago and we just um,
you know,

3370
02:44:31,001 --> 02:44:35,080
we had a choice of where to live.
We wanted to live in berkeley.

3371
02:44:35,081 --> 02:44:38,000
That's where my offices.
And so we ended up living up on,

3372
02:44:38,230 --> 02:44:42,040
on top of the hill and that was somewhat
intentional for me.

3373
02:44:42,041 --> 02:44:47,041
It's right near tilden park,
which is a outdoor regional park space 

3374
02:44:47,041 --> 02:44:48,300
with a lot of green area and stuff.
And,

3375
02:44:48,820 --> 02:44:51,180
and there are parts of berkeley that,
you know,

3376
02:44:51,190 --> 02:44:53,140
where the air quality is really,
really bad.

3377
02:44:53,141 --> 02:44:55,870
Like surprising if you don't,
if you don't know that area,

3378
02:44:55,871 --> 02:44:58,570
if you go online to some of these air 
quality ratings sites,

3379
02:44:58,571 --> 02:45:01,600
you can see that parts of berkeley or 
like c minus or d,

3380
02:45:02,070 --> 02:45:07,070
um,
because there's so much industry there 

3381
02:45:07,070 --> 02:45:08,230
and the chevron plan and stuff,
but this is where it gets really,

3382
02:45:08,530 --> 02:45:10,990
you know,
the inequalities is brutal because guess

3383
02:45:10,991 --> 02:45:15,991
who ends up often living in the areas 
that are most toxic are the people who 

3384
02:45:15,991 --> 02:45:20,910
are economically disadvantaged and 
they're the least influential when it 

3385
02:45:20,910 --> 02:45:24,310
comes to any kind of political power to,
to change,

3386
02:45:24,340 --> 02:45:25,930
make changes in those areas.

3387
02:45:25,930 --> 02:45:28,170
So it's unfair.
It's,

3388
02:45:28,171 --> 02:45:33,171
it's,
and they're disproportionately affected 

3389
02:45:33,171 --> 02:45:33,580
by that because they,
nobody's watching out for them.

3390
02:45:34,120 --> 02:45:34,920
Yeah.
Well there's,

3391
02:45:34,921 --> 02:45:35,410
there's a lot of it,
a lot of

3392
02:45:35,410 --> 02:45:37,750
factors we could talk about,
but I think,

3393
02:45:37,751 --> 02:45:38,900
uh,
uh,

3394
02:45:39,220 --> 02:45:44,220
it's just,
it's so important that there's people 

3395
02:45:44,220 --> 02:45:44,220
like you out there that are highlighting
these things,

3396
02:45:44,220 --> 02:45:46,570
are writing books about these things and
talking about these things on podcast.

3397
02:45:46,571 --> 02:45:47,770
So thank you so much,
man.

3398
02:45:47,950 --> 02:45:49,660
Thank you for your book and thank you 
for that.

3399
02:45:49,750 --> 02:45:51,190
Pleasure.
Last time you were here,

3400
02:45:51,191 --> 02:45:54,010

so tell people one more time the name of

3401
02:45:54,011 --> 02:45:55,540
the book where to get it.
