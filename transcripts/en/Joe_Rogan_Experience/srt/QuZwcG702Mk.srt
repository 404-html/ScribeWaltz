1
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:10,330
Experience.

2
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,350
Louis is here from unbox therapy,

3
00:00:24,351 --> 00:00:26,870
sweating our beautiful new
equipment that doesn't work.

4
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,060
Especially our new fucking
super awesome HD set up.

5
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,650
We were supposed to be live in HD by now,

6
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,740
but someone fucked us.

7
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:42,130
They sold us this fucking Sony HD box
that's supposed to work great with

8
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,370
Ustream.

9
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,640
Doesn't fucking work at all with Ustream.

10
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,060
Not only is it not work with you steam,

11
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,220
it's never been proven
to work with Ustream.

12
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:49,831
Use Dreams.

13
00:00:49,831 --> 00:00:54,831
Never got one from them to
test it lies and propaganda.

14
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,090
At least.

15
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,350
At least it's pretty looking though.

16
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,760
It looks dope as fuck.

17
00:00:58,761 --> 00:01:02,840
So we'll probably wind up going with a
tri caster cause this fucking sack of

18
00:01:02,841 --> 00:01:05,030
shit isn't working correctly.

19
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,980
And we're watching,

20
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:10,823
um,

21
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:11,460
that we,

22
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,230
we talked about zero before the podcast
started that has anything to do with

23
00:01:15,231 --> 00:01:15,740
tech.

24
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,810
Everything was about sexual allegations,

25
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,490
sexual assault allegations,

26
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,040
whether or not someone should be rioting,

27
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,520
whether or not these fucking idiots that
are closing down the one on one freeway

28
00:01:25,521 --> 00:01:29,000
in La to protest something
that happened in another state.

29
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,600
It's crazy times.

30
00:01:31,601 --> 00:01:33,560
The yellow is that about
all these crazy white,

31
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,430
it's all white people that
are protesting like in,

32
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:36,650
do you,

33
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:39,380
have you seen New York City
in New York City as well?

34
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:39,771
Oh yeah.

35
00:01:39,771 --> 00:01:42,290
They won't show it on the news
because it's like everyone's like,

36
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:43,340
it's all white people.

37
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,930
It's all these like wow.

38
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:45,770
Emo,

39
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:46,491
white people,

40
00:01:46,491 --> 00:01:49,280
social justice warriors demanding justice.

41
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:50,660
I Dunno.

42
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,493
It's rampant.

43
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,363
Everybody's,

44
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,330
everybody's trying to latch on it to
express themselves through this high

45
00:01:56,331 --> 00:01:57,590
profile situation.

46
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:57,981
Well,

47
00:01:57,981 --> 00:02:02,981
I think that there's no doubt there can
be no doubt that there's a real issue

48
00:02:03,621 --> 00:02:04,580
with police brutality.

49
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:05,660
There can be no doubt.

50
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,400
There's many instances,

51
00:02:07,401 --> 00:02:08,720
and this is not the best one.

52
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:09,200
You know,

53
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,200
Jamie was talking about it before the
podcast that the 12 year old boy who was

54
00:02:14,331 --> 00:02:16,820
shot in Cleveland with a fake gun,

55
00:02:16,821 --> 00:02:17,720
a toy gun,

56
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,160
like seconds after the cops arrive.

57
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,970
That is way scarier to me.

58
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,270
That kid that was shot in a
Walmart who had a toy gun,

59
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,130
that is way scarier to me.

60
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:28,800
You know?

61
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,740
Then even asking questions,

62
00:02:30,741 --> 00:02:31,341
talking,

63
00:02:31,341 --> 00:02:32,480
trying to find out what's going on,

64
00:02:32,481 --> 00:02:33,320
they're just shooting.

65
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:33,981
Yeah.

66
00:02:33,981 --> 00:02:34,310
It's funny.

67
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:39,310
It's a funny thing about which news
stories prevail and become the mainstream

68
00:02:40,371 --> 00:02:41,510
ones they need to be.

69
00:02:41,511 --> 00:02:46,370
This is sort of perfect and appealing
package that people want to share and talk

70
00:02:46,371 --> 00:02:49,070
about and sort of that
drives conversation.

71
00:02:49,071 --> 00:02:49,380
They the,

72
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,510
the really like obviously
terrible ones that nobody has,

73
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:54,140
you know,

74
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,940
like it's hard to have an opinion about
that other than that's terrible when

75
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,160
when it comes to like a
kid shot with a toy gun

76
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,533
versus the other one.

77
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,690
The other situation in a Michael Brown.

78
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,001
Yeah,

79
00:03:05,001 --> 00:03:09,160
the Michael Brown situation where
for some reason they're appear,

80
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:09,510
you know,

81
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:09,760
there,

82
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,061
there's,

83
00:03:10,061 --> 00:03:12,700
there's these defined sides
on that and that thing.

84
00:03:12,701 --> 00:03:14,950
There's very little gray
area for discussion.

85
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,390
It's like pick your team.

86
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,670
We were talking about
this before the show,

87
00:03:17,671 --> 00:03:19,360
but I was watching on Twitter,

88
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:24,690
a white rapper and a black guy arguing
and the black guy was on the side of the

89
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:29,290
cop that shot the kid,

90
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:29,910
the,

91
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,581
and you know,

92
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:31,590
it wasn't an asshole,

93
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,291
wasn't a Republican.

94
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:32,740
He was saying,

95
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:32,951
look,

96
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:37,951
the reality is this guy had robbed a store
just before then had been involved in

97
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,760
a bunch of criminal type behaviors.

98
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,760
And there's witnesses saying
that he charged the cop,

99
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,860
like you don't know what happened.

100
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:48,920
And the,

101
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,910
the white rapper was arguing
with him and he was saying,

102
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:57,240
you are blind to the facts in
your desire to be down and,

103
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,530
you know,

104
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,890
which had to hurt the white rapper.

105
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,161
Right.

106
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:00,401
You know,

107
00:04:00,401 --> 00:04:02,740
black I accuses you of fucking posing,

108
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:03,311
but there's,

109
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:04,100
I mean,

110
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:04,610
that's,

111
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,370
but that's what's happening
in the street right now,

112
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:06,731
isn't it?

113
00:04:06,731 --> 00:04:06,941
I mean,

114
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:07,571
it's the same thing.

115
00:04:07,571 --> 00:04:08,950
It's that it's,

116
00:04:08,951 --> 00:04:09,280
uh,

117
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,900
it's appealing for people to latch onto
a cause in order to help try to identify

118
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:14,550
themselves.

119
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,190
Yeah.

120
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,380
You know,

121
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,420
to get something out of it,

122
00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:18,400
to get some kind of very
good way of defining it.

123
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:18,581
Yeah.

124
00:04:18,581 --> 00:04:20,140
To get some kind of a,

125
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:21,410
I dunno,

126
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:22,360
like they like this,

127
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,500
this kind of a wind can be a success for
them that they can express themselves

128
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:27,334
through,

129
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,240
uh,

130
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,230
these kinds of issues.

131
00:04:29,231 --> 00:04:30,640
But obviously it's not about,

132
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,920
it's not just about a cop shooting a guy.

133
00:04:32,921 --> 00:04:33,640
Right.

134
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,470
It's like in this particular case,

135
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,820
it appears to me that it's part of a
much bigger issue in specifically that

136
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:40,654
area.

137
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:41,170
Uh,

138
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:41,441
and,

139
00:04:41,441 --> 00:04:41,810
and,

140
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,630
and probably the way of life.

141
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,110
They're like,

142
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,130
is it really,

143
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,870
you need to be a certain kind of
person to just jump on a riot train,

144
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,460
right?

145
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:50,760
Like,

146
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,190
oh,

147
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:51,670
wicked,

148
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:52,503
perfect,

149
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,100
let's burn down more shit.

150
00:04:54,101 --> 00:04:54,371
Right?

151
00:04:54,371 --> 00:04:55,020
Yeah.

152
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,570
And I mean,

153
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,340
sometimes it will be,

154
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,610
it's not necessarily just race.

155
00:05:00,611 --> 00:05:02,500
Sometimes it will be a
certain set of circumstances,

156
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:06,520
like a sports team loses and people
go crazy and start smashing cars and

157
00:05:06,521 --> 00:05:06,941
whatever,

158
00:05:06,941 --> 00:05:07,650
and it,

159
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,550
it's somehow attracts
other people to that,

160
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,140
to that,

161
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:10,320
uh,

162
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:10,811
agenda.

163
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:11,644
I remember,

164
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:11,891
uh,

165
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:12,970
in Toronto during,

166
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,750
I think it was the g 20 summit when
it was like the first time ever,

167
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:19,450
people had like smashed when I
was living downtown at the time.

168
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,913
And I had a,

169
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:24,610
I had my first kid will and he was little.

170
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,720
And I remember sitting at home inside
and knowing that people were out there

171
00:05:28,721 --> 00:05:29,860
smashing windows going like,

172
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,980
how in God's name are
these people justifying it?

173
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:33,281
How,

174
00:05:33,281 --> 00:05:38,170
how do they believe for a moment that
smashing his Starbucks is what's going to

175
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,010
change anything.

176
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,520
It's such a weird way to
try and get what you want.

177
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:42,871
Is it,

178
00:05:42,871 --> 00:05:43,704
is it any,

179
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,040
it's not even a Po.

180
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,180
I Dunno.

181
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,330
It seems to me like the equivalent
of kicking and screaming as an adult.

182
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:49,601
Oh,

183
00:05:49,601 --> 00:05:49,830
it's,

184
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,800
it's even worse.

185
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,030
It's so idiotic.

186
00:05:52,031 --> 00:05:56,230
There was a Twitter post today that I
read where this guy was standing in front

187
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,070
of a BMW in

188
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:58,851
Oakland,

189
00:05:58,851 --> 00:05:59,930
California,

190
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:04,880
which by the way is nowhere fucking near
Ferguson and the windows were smashed

191
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,590
and it said,

192
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,660
fuck corporations,

193
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,493
corporations.

194
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,570
Let me tell you something.

195
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:12,830
You dumb cunt.

196
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:17,450
You wrote that on a phone that
was made by a fucking corporation.

197
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:22,460
You piece of Shit fucking dunce and you
broadcast the damn picture via another

198
00:06:22,941 --> 00:06:27,170
corporation that allowed you to even have
the voice to reach the people that you

199
00:06:27,171 --> 00:06:28,250
ended up reaching with it.

200
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,460
And what has BMW done
besides make awesome cars?

201
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,760
What have they done this so terrible
besides making fantastically engineered

202
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:40,910
automobiles that you couldn't
possibly come up with yourself?

203
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:41,390
Yeah,

204
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:41,810
I don't,

205
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,190
I don't know specifically,

206
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:47,510
but I think it is very strange that
people pick and choose which corporations

207
00:06:47,511 --> 00:06:49,430
are there for them and
which ones are against them.

208
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:54,820
Because ultimately this entire economic
ecosystem is what allows everyone to

209
00:06:55,251 --> 00:06:58,410
survive and what allows anyone
to have any kind of wellbeing.

210
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,330
It's not perfect.

211
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,740
Everybody knows that.

212
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:04,430
But when you burned down and
Mcdonald's in your neighborhood,

213
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:08,480
you're taking away jobs from the
people that actually need them.

214
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,201
You know what I mean?

215
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:09,770
Like,

216
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,030
or the Walmart or whatever,

217
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:13,880
whatever it was at the destruction
that's happening over there.

218
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,890
It's like by,

219
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,910
by force,

220
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,500
you want to throw a Tantrum,

221
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:22,970
but at the same time the consequence
is bigger than you personally.

222
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,223
It's a,

223
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,311
there are,

224
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:28,670
I'm sure plenty of upstanding citizens
who just wanted to go back to work.

225
00:07:28,671 --> 00:07:33,110
And this corporation that
you're angry with is actually,

226
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,980
uh,

227
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:38,420
something that people rely on in
the case of this BMW dealership.

228
00:07:38,421 --> 00:07:38,870
I mean,

229
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:42,770
you're talking about such
an unrelated institution.

230
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,131
Yes.

231
00:07:43,131 --> 00:07:45,440
So unrelated Starbucks.

232
00:07:45,441 --> 00:07:48,080
There's people that were guarding
Starbucks and we're freaking out.

233
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:49,220
Fuck Starbucks.

234
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:49,581
You know,

235
00:07:49,581 --> 00:07:50,720
what about the people?

236
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,620
What about the people?

237
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:53,300
People pay for that stuff.

238
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,980
You know that Starbucks is a franchise,

239
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,390
like someone owns it.

240
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,040
They had an air earned money,

241
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:58,970
save it,

242
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,470
get a bank loan,

243
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,120
go out of their way,

244
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,780
hire employees,

245
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,790
put together a business model.

246
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,350
I mean Jesus fucking Christ,

247
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:09,260
this childlike view of the world,

248
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,910
and this is not exonerating police,

249
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:14,590
this is not,

250
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:19,590
and I feel for the police because I think
their job is almost impossible to be a

251
00:08:20,661 --> 00:08:24,410
cop and a crime ridden
area is almost impossible.

252
00:08:24,411 --> 00:08:29,411
There's almost nothing you can do to
stem the tide unless you could go back in

253
00:08:29,451 --> 00:08:32,270
time and somehow or another,

254
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:36,110
not even the parents of the children
who grew up to be criminals,

255
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:39,620
but the parents of the parents that the
children that grubs were criminals and

256
00:08:39,621 --> 00:08:40,910
somehow reach them,

257
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:46,060
somehow educate them or provide them
with some sort of counseling or some,

258
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:53,210
some factor that's going to change
the way they view the world and view

259
00:08:53,211 --> 00:08:56,040
community and view each
other and give them

260
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,873
opportunity.

261
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:01,940
Give them some sort of a way to
not be involved in a life of crime,

262
00:09:03,031 --> 00:09:08,031
not be involved in these horrible cyclical
repeating relationships that seem to

263
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,020
occur in these terrible areas.

264
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,760
So many factors and,

265
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,040
and in many cases,

266
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:20,730
the areas themselves
reinforce the behavior,

267
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:21,270
uh,

268
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,081
through various means.

269
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:24,920
Like I used to watch the first
48 have you ever seen that show?

270
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:30,420
And you get to see how like immediately
after a crime takes place what the cops

271
00:09:30,421 --> 00:09:31,320
are working with,

272
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,250
uh,

273
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,540
as far as the,

274
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:33,750
uh,

275
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,381
the evidence,

276
00:09:34,381 --> 00:09:35,214
but also,

277
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:35,641
uh,

278
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:39,450
the witnesses and trying to get anybody
to say anything about what happened,

279
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,760
but kind of like a super core,

280
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,840
fundamental level.

281
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,560
If you don't want to tell the police that,

282
00:09:46,561 --> 00:09:47,071
you know,

283
00:09:47,071 --> 00:09:48,210
who killed somebody,

284
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,810
is that really any different
than participating?

285
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,010
Like then being a part of it,

286
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:58,530
it's so weird to me that that's considered
to be an acceptable thing amongst

287
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,280
that community right there.

288
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,400
The no snitching thing
and no snitching thing.

289
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,520
It's like,

290
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,353
hmm.

291
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,660
That to me just sounds like you're afraid.

292
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:12,260
That to me just sounds like the actual
power within that group doesn't lie

293
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,533
within,

294
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,110
uh,

295
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,120
the police or authority or whoever,

296
00:10:18,121 --> 00:10:19,320
but it lies somewhere else.

297
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,780
But you're somehow justifying
it to yourself by saying,

298
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:21,991
oh,

299
00:10:21,991 --> 00:10:24,840
I really am participating
because I chose not to snitch.

300
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:25,161
Well,

301
00:10:25,161 --> 00:10:26,810
if you live in that community though,

302
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,920
and you did snitch,

303
00:10:27,921 --> 00:10:29,660
the consequences would be dire.

304
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,021
I mean,

305
00:10:30,021 --> 00:10:33,950
it's not something that's like an easy
thing to stand up for if you're living in

306
00:10:33,951 --> 00:10:34,784
a crime ridden.

307
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,953
Sure.

308
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,420
But then you also shouldn't
expect anything to change.

309
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:39,900
Boy,

310
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,240
that's,

311
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,320
it's weird to put the ownness on the,

312
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:42,860
the,

313
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:46,060
the people that are poor and
they're living in these areas.

314
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,983
I see.

315
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:47,680
I don't,

316
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:47,900
I,

317
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,680
it's not,

318
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,060
it's not completely that way.

319
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:51,380
Obviously there are things that could,

320
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,280
could happen surrounding that
world that could help it out,

321
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,270
but ultimately to get
yourself up out of there,

322
00:10:59,300 --> 00:10:59,820
it has,

323
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,770
doesn't it have to be,

324
00:11:00,771 --> 00:11:00,921
I mean,

325
00:11:00,921 --> 00:11:04,700
who can really walk into that community
who's not a part of it and change and

326
00:11:04,701 --> 00:11:05,534
change something.

327
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,560
It's not like,

328
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,700
it's not like you're wanted there,

329
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:07,911
you know?

330
00:11:07,911 --> 00:11:11,690
It's not like when the police go in there,

331
00:11:11,691 --> 00:11:16,370
they're treated in a certain way
because maybe the life they lead is so

332
00:11:16,371 --> 00:11:18,560
different than that of
the individuals in that,

333
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,660
in that lifestyle themselves,

334
00:11:20,661 --> 00:11:21,450
you know,

335
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,750
well also that US versus them
mentality gets some printed.

336
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,810
It gets cemented in,

337
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,450
in terms of sports teams.

338
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:32,070
So imagine how crazy it gets when you're
dealing with crime ridden neighborhoods

339
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:33,330
and police.

340
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,240
It's so hard to break free of.

341
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,570
I worked as a security guard for a very
short period of time when I was a kid

342
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,370
and um,

343
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,080
it was a place called great woods.

344
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:43,981
Uh,

345
00:11:43,981 --> 00:11:46,590
it's like a concert
place in Massachusetts.

346
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,860
And one of the things that I remember
really clearly is realizing that we had

347
00:11:51,931 --> 00:11:55,180
all developed this us versus
them mentality at the,

348
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,470
there was these crazy drunk concert
goers who would cause trouble and do all

349
00:11:59,471 --> 00:12:00,370
kinds of crazy shit.

350
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:04,480
And then there was us and we had
developed as very clear us versus them

351
00:12:04,481 --> 00:12:06,340
mentality that I saw people,

352
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:11,710
I saw people act on this against
people that weren't a problem,

353
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:12,310
you know,

354
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,720
and I remember watching it,

355
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,081
you know,

356
00:12:14,081 --> 00:12:16,210
kind of step back from it,

357
00:12:16,211 --> 00:12:18,640
but a part of it as well because
I'm wearing a security outfit.

358
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:19,521
I'm going,

359
00:12:19,521 --> 00:12:19,680
okay,

360
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,010
we're doing like cop shit.

361
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,540
This is like what cops do.

362
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:22,930
Yeah.

363
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:23,800
And then I was thinking like,

364
00:12:23,801 --> 00:12:24,100
man,

365
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,140
I wonder if that's just like what happens.

366
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,170
And you know that Stanford study
that they did where they took,

367
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,940
uh,

368
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,210
they,

369
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:30,640
they,

370
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:35,320
they did like a prison study where they
put people in jail and they made one

371
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:39,100
group become security guards
and one group become prisoners.

372
00:12:39,101 --> 00:12:40,600
I believe it was Stanford wasn't Stanford.

373
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:42,700
Um,

374
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,111
but they,

375
00:12:43,111 --> 00:12:45,070
they had to call it off.

376
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,880
Like they had to cut it short
because the people that were,

377
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:53,910
the guards had been so shitty to the
fucking people that were the prisoners.

378
00:12:53,921 --> 00:12:54,401
They were like,

379
00:12:54,401 --> 00:12:54,491
well,

380
00:12:54,491 --> 00:12:57,130
this is like inherent human
behavior or something like that.

381
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:02,290
It's almost like there's a pattern that
people slide into that unless they're

382
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,720
really consciously aware of not doing it.

383
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:05,570
Yeah.

384
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:07,150
The Stanford prison experiment.

385
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,020
Wow.

386
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:08,351
Yeah.

387
00:13:08,351 --> 00:13:13,351
And it was a really eye opening to a
lot of people that is power is a very

388
00:13:14,831 --> 00:13:15,730
corrupting thing.

389
00:13:15,731 --> 00:13:16,001
Right.

390
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:17,860
Especially that kind of ultimate power.

391
00:13:17,861 --> 00:13:20,530
Like someone's in jail or you have a gun,

392
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:23,230
you can shoot them and you're allowed to.

393
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:24,881
Yeah.

394
00:13:24,881 --> 00:13:25,720
It's a,

395
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,141
it's a,

396
00:13:26,141 --> 00:13:30,370
it's an unfortunate thing that that's
the only way to govern ourselves that

397
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,010
we're forced to to do
so at the end of a gun,

398
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:33,670
like,

399
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:33,941
yeah.

400
00:13:33,941 --> 00:13:34,500
Right.

401
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,610
You hope that that,

402
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,310
that doesn't have,

403
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,140
have to have to happen frequently,

404
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,490
but ultimately that's part of what's
holding this whole damn thing together.

405
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,343
You know,

406
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,210
I drive down the highway
to get here and he's like,

407
00:13:46,211 --> 00:13:47,044
Jesus,

408
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,270
everybody is in their lane.

409
00:13:49,271 --> 00:13:53,650
All of these different mechanisms at play
to keep order to keep things happening

410
00:13:53,651 --> 00:13:55,630
and as smooth sort of way.

411
00:13:55,631 --> 00:13:56,081
And yeah,

412
00:13:56,081 --> 00:13:57,670
there's crazy shit going on elsewhere,

413
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:02,671
but we've also done one hell of a job
of having the vast majority of people

414
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:03,580
comply.

415
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,060
Yes.

416
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,110
Based on the system.

417
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:08,490
That's something that people overlook
when they think about chaos and mom

418
00:14:08,491 --> 00:14:09,324
society,

419
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:14,170
like God is so safe and organized in
comparison to the number of people.

420
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,073
Yes.

421
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,930
I was in Mexico City reasonably
right for the UFC first time.

422
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:20,470
Yeah.

423
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:20,860
Wow.

424
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,770
And Mexico City is first of all,

425
00:14:23,771 --> 00:14:24,520
everybody thinks like,

426
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,031
oh my God,

427
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,250
you don't get kidnapped on the God.

428
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,070
He didn't get shot.

429
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:27,551
First of all,

430
00:14:27,551 --> 00:14:28,870
they are the nicest people.

431
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,210
Mexicans in Mexico City are so friendly,

432
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,170
they're so nice.

433
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:37,380
But their version of order and our
version of order are very different there.

434
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:38,110
You know what,

435
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:38,711
stop lights,

436
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,210
optional gridlock.

437
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,500
You know how we have grid lock?

438
00:14:41,501 --> 00:14:44,560
Occasionally someone fucks up and they
get stuck in an intersection when the

439
00:14:44,561 --> 00:14:46,120
light changes and everybody beeps at them.

440
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:49,120
In Mexico there is only gridlock,

441
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,560
like there's no getting out of it.

442
00:14:51,561 --> 00:14:52,430
The lights change

443
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,590
and it's just bumper to
bumper in both directions.

444
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:59,890
And I saw people that were trying to
merge and they would just pull in,

445
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:03,380
they would just pull in front of
everybody and you're talking about six,

446
00:15:03,381 --> 00:15:07,240
seven lanes and these people
just pull into the lane and,

447
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:10,170
and people would just sort of stop
and some people wouldn't stop them.

448
00:15:10,171 --> 00:15:11,390
They didn't have to pull forward.

449
00:15:11,391 --> 00:15:13,500
And it was fucking crazy and it,

450
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,331
and I'm laughing,

451
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:16,460
I'm talking to the guy that
was driving and I was like,

452
00:15:16,461 --> 00:15:17,294
is this normal?

453
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,360
And he's like,

454
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:18,590
ah,

455
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,031
these none,

456
00:15:19,031 --> 00:15:19,221
no.

457
00:15:19,221 --> 00:15:20,100
This way in America,

458
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:21,650
no.

459
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:22,191
In America,

460
00:15:22,191 --> 00:15:23,030
when it's a red light,

461
00:15:23,031 --> 00:15:24,360
people actually stop.

462
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:25,881
It's amazing.

463
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:28,250
It is amazing how well
trained we actually are.

464
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,430
I mean a light comes up
and everyone complies.

465
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:32,181
The odd,

466
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:32,540
it's a,

467
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:37,010
it's a very minor outlier that actually
disobeys that even though it's a fairly

468
00:15:37,011 --> 00:15:40,100
simple thing and most of the time
no one's probably going to die.

469
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:40,880
But we,

470
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,713
it's just,

471
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,830
it seems like when you're
relatively well taken care of,

472
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,290
it's so much easier to
just fucking comply.

473
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,010
Yes.

474
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:49,430
And when you,

475
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:50,250
when everything's okay,

476
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,540
when your belly is full and you
know your children are safe,

477
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,140
the minute that you take away
the necessities all it's like,

478
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:57,860
yeah,

479
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,693
let's go.

480
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,470
There's a thin veneer.

481
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,333
Yes.

482
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:06,670
Oh they days and you get like these
crazy people like Zombie apocalypse type

483
00:16:06,741 --> 00:16:07,101
people.

484
00:16:07,101 --> 00:16:08,420
Like it's all gonna crumble.

485
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,190
But truthfully speaking,

486
00:16:10,191 --> 00:16:11,270
how much would it take?

487
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:11,841
You know,

488
00:16:11,841 --> 00:16:15,530
I mean it's not like you need a complete
collapse of the infrastructure to get

489
00:16:15,531 --> 00:16:16,251
people panicking.

490
00:16:16,251 --> 00:16:18,710
I remember that big
blackout on the East Coast,

491
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:19,140
uh,

492
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:22,580
a few years back where it knocked gas
stations out and knocked most people's

493
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:24,700
houses out and you know,

494
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:29,120
people were running their air conditioners
too much and that the panic was real

495
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:30,890
there.

496
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:31,723
People were like,

497
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,560
people had to talk to each other,

498
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,030
a one to one and be like,

499
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:35,990
you know which piece,

500
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,700
which pizza place still has food?

501
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,040
Which ovens are running off propane?

502
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:43,400
Like it was dipping quick
and I was like a week,

503
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:48,380
my friend Tommy was in Connecticut
when that big snow storm hit and he was

504
00:16:48,381 --> 00:16:51,860
telling me how they had a drive
hours just to use a cell phone.

505
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:55,040
It'll drive like two hours
to find a cell phone service.

506
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,270
You had to find food like we went,

507
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,520
he was saying that we went to,

508
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:58,810
he,

509
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:02,270
you know he and his girl had went to
Dunkin donuts for food and there was a

510
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:05,880
giant line outside of Dunkin donuts
cause it was the only place to that end.

511
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,420
Exactly.

512
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,790
Putting your body exactly.

513
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,750
Any calories.

514
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:09,530
That's what happened at,

515
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:12,710
that's exactly what happened in my
area when it originally happened is

516
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,610
essentially you had like one pizza place
feeding the entire community until the,

517
00:17:16,611 --> 00:17:17,600
until they ran out.

518
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:18,950
And,

519
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:22,880
but it really exposes the
fact that we have such,

520
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,850
this kind of gets into
the world of technology,

521
00:17:25,851 --> 00:17:30,851
but like basic skills like sort
of just being a human skills,

522
00:17:31,101 --> 00:17:32,920
survival skills week.

523
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:33,590
Yeah.

524
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,423
In general,

525
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,060
in general.

526
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,350
Oh across society.

527
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:40,370
If we were forced to rely on our
own beans to deal with like a B,

528
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,260
c Jesus,

529
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:42,920
take,

530
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,660
take away the cell phone on its own.

531
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:45,321
I mean,

532
00:17:45,321 --> 00:17:45,730
I'm not,

533
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:46,970
I'm uh,

534
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,860
we were talking about doing a video
like 24 hours without technology.

535
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:52,560
Like maybe we'll get a map and
we'll have a set of challenges.

536
00:17:52,561 --> 00:17:52,711
Like,

537
00:17:52,711 --> 00:17:55,380
try not to use your phone,

538
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,670
but having,

539
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:57,210
being,

540
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:57,391
you know,

541
00:17:57,391 --> 00:17:59,060
thinking about that as
I was on my way out.

542
00:17:59,090 --> 00:17:59,290
I mean,

543
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:00,450
I'm on Google maps,

544
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,800
I'm analyzing traffic.

545
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,080
I'm rerouting based on accidents.

546
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:04,950
Right.

547
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,600
It's like take that away.

548
00:18:06,601 --> 00:18:10,080
And how much more ineffective am
I at participating in all of that?

549
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:10,491
Yeah.

550
00:18:10,491 --> 00:18:13,230
I have a friend who doesn't
use the navigation systems.

551
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,240
He still uses maps.

552
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,650
Wow.

553
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:17,520
I looked in his car like,

554
00:18:17,521 --> 00:18:17,590
what?

555
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,690
Where's your navigation system?

556
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,940
And he goes out the old paper,

557
00:18:20,941 --> 00:18:21,300
Matt,

558
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,530
when he's an author too.

559
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:22,711
I mean,

560
00:18:22,711 --> 00:18:22,831
he's,

561
00:18:22,831 --> 00:18:23,100
um,

562
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,960
he's a wealthy guy and he goes,

563
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:25,620
I just don't,

564
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,520
I don't want to deal with it.

565
00:18:26,521 --> 00:18:26,720
I go,

566
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,470
we want to do with what
the things are awesome.

567
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:29,221
Like,

568
00:18:29,221 --> 00:18:30,630
what the fuck are you talking about?

569
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:31,120
Like you,

570
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,820
you don't want to be a part of the new
information that's coming your way.

571
00:18:35,821 --> 00:18:37,710
That tells you how to be more convenient,

572
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:38,760
more,

573
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,593
more efficient.

574
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,480
You can get around this accident.

575
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,830
Don't you want to know it's there?

576
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,151
Like why would you,

577
00:18:45,151 --> 00:18:49,340
so what do you think that's about wanting
to be like living in the fucking past,

578
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,300
this longing for nostalgia.

579
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:54,840
Like you know he wants to fucking fall
smoke signals to find the village.

580
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,640
I don't understand it.

581
00:18:56,641 --> 00:19:00,120
It's funny that anybody who's
nostalgic like that or avoiding change,

582
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,920
they only want to go back so far.

583
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,013
They don't want,

584
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,960
they don't want to go the caveman style.

585
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,290
It's like it's just a,

586
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,560
everyone picks a point in their life.

587
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:15,060
Even now I have friends who have
picked that point like they're done.

588
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,970
This is as far as they're
going with technology and like,

589
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:18,391
you know,

590
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:21,790
you're showing them a smartwatch
or whatever it might be in,

591
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,251
or even even,

592
00:19:23,251 --> 00:19:26,070
not that like it could be a piece
of software or social media,

593
00:19:26,071 --> 00:19:27,870
like they're on team Facebook,

594
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,700
but Twitter's too much or something.

595
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:33,570
It's funny how at some point people
flip the switch and they're like,

596
00:19:33,571 --> 00:19:35,340
this is as far as I'm
going with this damn thing.

597
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,090
Yeah.

598
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:36,421
Yeah.

599
00:19:36,421 --> 00:19:38,520
There's that weird thing that people do.

600
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:38,790
Uh,

601
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,001
you know,

602
00:19:39,001 --> 00:19:41,370
you have kids and I have kids who
I've talked to many people at,

603
00:19:41,371 --> 00:19:41,581
man,

604
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:43,680
I wouldn't want to bring
kids up today in this world.

605
00:19:43,681 --> 00:19:44,250
I'm like,

606
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,180
what are you talking about?

607
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,100
People brought up kids when they were
woolly mammoths when they're fucking saber

608
00:19:50,101 --> 00:19:52,440
tooth tigers and like one,

609
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,290
one in a hundred infants survive.

610
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,341
What are you talking about?

611
00:19:56,341 --> 00:19:58,230
This is like the best
time to have a kid ever.

612
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:58,711
You know,

613
00:19:58,711 --> 00:20:00,540
they have amazing doctors.

614
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,410
Yeah,

615
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:01,700
you were.

616
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:06,360
You really have very little to worry about
and the kid has so many advantages of

617
00:20:06,361 --> 00:20:08,250
themselves from a learning perspective.

618
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,750
I am amazed.

619
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,390
I have a five and a three year old at how,

620
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,380
you know,

621
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,940
the unfiltered,

622
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:18,360
maybe unfiltered is a bad word because
I don't want them going everywhere that

623
00:20:18,361 --> 00:20:19,590
they want to go online maybe.

624
00:20:19,591 --> 00:20:20,040
Right,

625
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,311
right.

626
00:20:20,311 --> 00:20:21,060
Yet.

627
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:25,410
But the idea that they're in control of
the information that they participate

628
00:20:25,411 --> 00:20:25,570
in,

629
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:26,910
it's like a huge deal to me,

630
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,530
that they're not just flipping on the
TV and sitting through whatever is

631
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:32,820
programmed for them.

632
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,380
Instead they have the freedom to select
whatever it is that's interesting to

633
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:37,621
them.

634
00:20:37,621 --> 00:20:39,180
And I know that in my life,

635
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:42,720
when I started to really
identify the things that I liked,

636
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:46,950
it was when I really started to progress
in what I was capable of personally.

637
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,130
That's the essence of

638
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:48,761
education,

639
00:20:48,761 --> 00:20:53,761
at least the best kind when you have a
basic kind of draw to a particular topic

640
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:58,060
and then you get there
and then you retain it.

641
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:58,811
That's,

642
00:20:58,811 --> 00:21:01,030
I mean that's really the whole package.

643
00:21:01,031 --> 00:21:02,200
And uh,

644
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:02,621
I don't know,

645
00:21:02,621 --> 00:21:02,951
you know,

646
00:21:02,951 --> 00:21:05,500
if we talked about education
the last time I was on here,

647
00:21:05,501 --> 00:21:06,370
but I mean,

648
00:21:06,371 --> 00:21:10,030
I remember growing up and not giving
a shit about a particular topic.

649
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,580
And then all of a sudden when
the Internet was amazing,

650
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:17,380
I find myself hours deep into a
particular article or I'm on Wikipedia.

651
00:21:17,381 --> 00:21:17,561
It's like,

652
00:21:17,561 --> 00:21:18,510
what am I doing right?

653
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,480
What am I doing?

654
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,700
The old me would have
thought that I was an idiot.

655
00:21:21,701 --> 00:21:22,480
You know,

656
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:22,691
like,

657
00:21:22,691 --> 00:21:22,991
dude,

658
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:24,250
get out and do something cool.

659
00:21:24,251 --> 00:21:25,084
Why are you,

660
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:29,110
but it's amazing how the context shifts
the entire conversation when you're

661
00:21:29,111 --> 00:21:30,250
doing it for yourself.

662
00:21:30,251 --> 00:21:31,870
When you're driving your own car,

663
00:21:31,871 --> 00:21:32,231
ship,

664
00:21:32,231 --> 00:21:33,064
whatever.

665
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:36,610
All of a sudden things become enticing
and interesting that when there was like

666
00:21:36,611 --> 00:21:38,170
a dictator pointing down saying,

667
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:39,400
this is the curriculum,

668
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:41,260
it just wasn't the same way.

669
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,920
It's also the enthusiasm of whoever's
telling you about the subject too.

670
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:46,880
Right.

671
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,630
There's some people that
can talk to you about like,

672
00:21:49,631 --> 00:21:50,590
I knew the grass.

673
00:21:50,591 --> 00:21:55,480
Tyson is my favorite example because
he's so passionate about space and about

674
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,850
astrophysics and when he's
talking about these things,

675
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,740
it becomes fascinating.

676
00:21:59,790 --> 00:21:59,980
Yeah.

677
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:04,360
Whereas you can watch a lecture that's
given by someone who's just has no

678
00:22:04,361 --> 00:22:05,470
interest in the subject,

679
00:22:05,471 --> 00:22:07,330
or excuse me,

680
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:09,550
no interest in teaching this subject.

681
00:22:09,551 --> 00:22:10,090
They're just,

682
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,470
they're just relaying information.

683
00:22:11,471 --> 00:22:14,200
They're just getting through it and they
think that all they have to do is plow

684
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:16,330
through it without any charisma,

685
00:22:16,331 --> 00:22:16,901
without any,

686
00:22:16,901 --> 00:22:17,411
that's what I was going to,

687
00:22:17,411 --> 00:22:18,910
I was going to use the exact same word,

688
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:23,940
is I think charisma is not something
that's abundant amongst people.

689
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:27,280
It's a very special thing that some have,

690
00:22:27,281 --> 00:22:28,114
some don't.

691
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,070
And it's like,

692
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,200
it's not a prerequisite
for becoming a teacher.

693
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:33,011
It's not like,

694
00:22:33,011 --> 00:22:33,640
wait,

695
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,080
let's evaluate their charisma.

696
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:35,440
Right.

697
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:35,860
No,

698
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,201
it's,

699
00:22:36,201 --> 00:22:36,480
it's,

700
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,170
it's a,

701
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:37,420
uh,

702
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:41,050
an institutional kind of
approach to how do you pump out,

703
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:41,501
you know,

704
00:22:41,501 --> 00:22:44,450
how do you factory farm teachers,

705
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,300
right.

706
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:45,790
And,

707
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:49,060
and so it's unfortunately
not a very difficult thing.

708
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:49,710
Well,

709
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:49,860
I don't,

710
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,800
I don't want to go that far.

711
00:22:50,801 --> 00:22:51,080
I mean,

712
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:51,171
it,

713
00:22:51,171 --> 00:22:53,110
it does take work to become a teacher,

714
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,400
but it's not like,

715
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,290
it's not like you're,

716
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,710
you're prequalifying them to be
entertaining or do you do a good job of,

717
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:03,310
of the things that lock a
person's eyeballs onto you.

718
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,030
And so there's the,

719
00:23:05,031 --> 00:23:10,031
the ratio of teachers that are charismatic
versus ones that ended up there is,

720
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,490
I don't know that you're ever
going to be able to fix that.

721
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:13,330
No,

722
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:13,841
I don't know.

723
00:23:13,841 --> 00:23:14,740
I don't know if you are either.

724
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:18,460
It's like trying to find charismatic
people to explain any subject to you.

725
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:20,080
Charismatic people that,

726
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:20,470
you know,

727
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:24,280
our managers have an office
arithmetic people that you know,

728
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,760
talk to you at a hospital about
what happened to your kid.

729
00:23:27,761 --> 00:23:28,181
You know what I mean?

730
00:23:28,181 --> 00:23:30,780
It's just like the charisma or none that,

731
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,140
I didn't even know that's the word.

732
00:23:32,141 --> 00:23:33,940
But genuine enthusiasm,

733
00:23:33,941 --> 00:23:34,774
passion,

734
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,550
passion is so contagious.

735
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:39,760
When something happens in the world,

736
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,150
uh,

737
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:40,660
and you,

738
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,010
you,

739
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:41,843
you can,

740
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,060
you can have two options.

741
00:23:43,061 --> 00:23:46,130
One is just the facts
laid out to you in a very

742
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:46,731
bland,

743
00:23:46,731 --> 00:23:47,570
monotone way.

744
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:51,680
And the other one is someone who's
extremely passionate about the subject.

745
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:54,130
Two talks about it with
like great emotion and,

746
00:23:54,131 --> 00:23:54,361
and,

747
00:23:54,361 --> 00:23:54,601
and,

748
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:54,841
and,

749
00:23:54,841 --> 00:23:55,520
and,

750
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,910
and understands the significance of the
information and how you are going to

751
00:23:58,911 --> 00:24:02,510
react to it and has this understanding
of the interpersonal reaction or

752
00:24:02,511 --> 00:24:05,030
relationship that's so huge to,

753
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,130
to taking in the information,

754
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,083
to absorbing it.

755
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:12,020
I think that the enemy of that
is the idea of curriculum.

756
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:14,630
The idea that there is a,

757
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:19,830
a very direct and concrete way of learning
something like you have this list of

758
00:24:21,471 --> 00:24:22,191
things at,

759
00:24:22,191 --> 00:24:23,420
by the end of this course,

760
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:25,760
this person's going to know
this and that and that,

761
00:24:25,761 --> 00:24:26,900
and they're going to be tested on it.

762
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,153
If I was at,

763
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:28,830
uh,

764
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:31,850
a teacher or a charismatic
person or whatever,

765
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:32,750
it's like,

766
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,320
I don't,

767
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,390
I don't want to just be your puppet,

768
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:39,500
your robot up there following the
set of guidelines that you set forth.

769
00:24:39,501 --> 00:24:43,100
They have very little freedom in what
they can bring into that conversation

770
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:48,370
against what's been approved by whatever
body is responsible for producing that,

771
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:49,760
that information.

772
00:24:49,761 --> 00:24:50,211
And you know,

773
00:24:50,211 --> 00:24:54,110
and oftentimes it's like the same guy
who's standing up there as the guy who's,

774
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,580
who's selling you the textbook.

775
00:24:55,581 --> 00:24:56,690
And there's like this weird,

776
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:02,110
this weird kind of thing baked into
it where it's not where it's about do.

777
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,760
It's like the path of least resistance.

778
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:06,770
It's about not ruffling any feathers.

779
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:11,800
It's about just getting from a to B to c
without really having a strong point of

780
00:25:12,351 --> 00:25:13,140
view.

781
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,980
But isn't it also about like you have
to have the basic building blocks.

782
00:25:16,981 --> 00:25:17,460
Yes.

783
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:22,230
And then from there you have to or you
should find something that you're truly

784
00:25:22,231 --> 00:25:23,860
interested in and then pick a career.

785
00:25:23,861 --> 00:25:24,694
But at what point,

786
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:29,810
at what point do you think that an
individual has the basic building block?

787
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:30,823
Right?

788
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:31,943
Where does it happen?

789
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,730
Because my opinion it
happens far too late.

790
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:39,080
I don't think we were encouraged at a
young age to really hyper focus on the

791
00:25:39,081 --> 00:25:40,190
things that are interesting to us.

792
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:40,921
Yeah,

793
00:25:40,921 --> 00:25:43,800
I think you've got a good point there
because I think that kids that do find

794
00:25:43,801 --> 00:25:45,540
something that they really enjoy early,

795
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:48,510
they have an an awesome headstart in like,

796
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:52,050
like they have hope as to like
what they would like to do,

797
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:52,530
I guess.

798
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:53,011
You know what I mean?

799
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:57,630
Like if you talked to someone who is
really involved in pick a field computer

800
00:25:57,631 --> 00:25:58,081
programming,

801
00:25:58,081 --> 00:26:01,680
they want to be a game developer and
they're 14 years old and they already

802
00:26:01,681 --> 00:26:03,120
started coding and they're
doing something like,

803
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,400
well this kid is on a path.

804
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:06,570
Whereas you know,

805
00:26:06,571 --> 00:26:10,050
some people are 20 and they're ne'er do
wells and they're just fucking laying

806
00:26:10,051 --> 00:26:12,720
around eating chips and then
trying to find their path.

807
00:26:12,721 --> 00:26:14,730
And I just got to find something
I'm really interested in.

808
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:15,743
Meanwhile,

809
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:20,720
as 14 year old brother is reading coding
magazines and already like reading,

810
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:21,450
you know,

811
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:25,140
reading about John Carmack and how you
started off in software and you know,

812
00:26:25,141 --> 00:26:25,710
he's like,

813
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,640
he's on a path,

814
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:27,120
you know,

815
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,590
and getting on a path can give you so
much energy and momentum and it makes it

816
00:26:31,591 --> 00:26:32,410
so exciting.

817
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:32,620
And

818
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:35,140
an argument would be that would be that,

819
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,500
well maybe that's not really where
their head was going to be at.

820
00:26:38,501 --> 00:26:40,960
Maybe you closed some door and that's,

821
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:41,950
that's like the fear,

822
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:42,611
right?

823
00:26:42,611 --> 00:26:43,071
That's what the,

824
00:26:43,071 --> 00:26:44,010
that's what like parents are

825
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,510
thinking and the kids themselves,

826
00:26:45,511 --> 00:26:49,380
that they need to have this vast array
of subject matter that they're proficient

827
00:26:49,381 --> 00:26:53,310
in because God forbid they end up wanting
to do something they're not prepared

828
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:54,144
for.

829
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:54,900
But that's like,

830
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,240
that's like a weird way of
looking at it in my opinion.

831
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:58,530
I think some people,

832
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:02,970
I think everybody at some point in their
lives has a particular skill that's

833
00:27:02,971 --> 00:27:03,930
worth exploring,

834
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,430
but oftentimes he doesn't
fit into the window of,

835
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,620
of what will be acceptable at that time.

836
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,040
Right.

837
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:15,060
And also your parents sometimes discourage
you from that if it seems like it's a

838
00:27:15,061 --> 00:27:17,850
tricky subject or it's
difficult to succeed in it.

839
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,210
Like my parents were not into
me being a comedian at hall.

840
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:21,960
Right.

841
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,201
You know,

842
00:27:22,201 --> 00:27:23,670
when I told my mom was
going to be a comedian,

843
00:27:23,671 --> 00:27:24,001
she was like,

844
00:27:24,001 --> 00:27:24,770
you're not even funny.

845
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:25,171
And I was like,

846
00:27:25,171 --> 00:27:26,004
Oh shit.

847
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:27,390
Oh mom,

848
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:28,801
fucking brutal.

849
00:27:28,801 --> 00:27:29,820
You want to know something though?

850
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:32,730
Think about the alternative
of your mom saying,

851
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:33,871
oh perfect,

852
00:27:33,871 --> 00:27:35,640
you're the funniest guy I've ever heard.

853
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:36,001
Like,

854
00:27:36,001 --> 00:27:38,970
I know guys like that too where their
moms or their biggest fans and it hasn't

855
00:27:38,971 --> 00:27:39,480
done very,

856
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,830
they're very much about them.

857
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,791
That's a good point.

858
00:27:41,791 --> 00:27:44,490
Like sometimes it's better if
they present you with a challenge.

859
00:27:44,491 --> 00:27:45,480
Like I'll show you,

860
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:48,541
you know,

861
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:49,374
like you,

862
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:54,710
if you get too much encouragement or
a distorted version of your actual

863
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:55,923
skillset,

864
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:57,030
that can be bad too.

865
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,080
Jamie,

866
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,100
something's going on in my throat,

867
00:27:59,101 --> 00:27:59,251
man.

868
00:27:59,251 --> 00:28:00,090
Come on and make some tea.

869
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:00,600
We have tea,

870
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,433
tea back there

871
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,910
fighting off something but not like
a cold or something in my throat.

872
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:10,970
Like I feel physically good but I'm going
a lot and I know that shit is annoying

873
00:28:11,071 --> 00:28:12,960
as fuck to you folks out there.

874
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,200
I think we were a reading
before we got going.

875
00:28:16,201 --> 00:28:20,610
Is that dude from CBC that was
facing sexual assault charges.

876
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,690
How do you say his name?

877
00:28:21,691 --> 00:28:22,800
John Gomez.

878
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:27,801
Meshy that is a weird subject
and a hard subject for me.

879
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,430
I have three daughters.

880
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,530
And when I read about dudes beaten up,

881
00:28:31,531 --> 00:28:33,750
women especially,

882
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,613
um,

883
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:38,610
this guy who's like this
really left wing progressive,

884
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:43,020
sweet voice guy who would do interviews
and talk to people like this,

885
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:47,910
pretty much the idea that that guy
was beating women up and you know,

886
00:28:47,911 --> 00:28:49,680
and doing it under the guise,

887
00:28:49,681 --> 00:28:49,950
I mean,

888
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:52,290
who the fuck knows what the reality is?

889
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:56,280
But the allegations are that he
was doing it under the guise of,

890
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,093
um,

891
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:02,580
fantasy or sexual fun.

892
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:02,851
I mean,

893
00:29:02,851 --> 00:29:03,684
what would you call it?

894
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,733
Bondage.

895
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,693
Yeah,

896
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:06,840
that's what it is.

897
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:11,870
And it's funny because I remember
when that craziness was going on,

898
00:29:11,941 --> 00:29:13,350
when 50 shades of grey came out,

899
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:17,130
it's like everybody on the subway
train had a copy and I didn't,

900
00:29:17,131 --> 00:29:17,881
obviously I didn't,

901
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,530
but it blew up.

902
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,240
And I remember thinking like,

903
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:26,390
this is the first time that bondage s
and m has really permeated pop culture,

904
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,220
like in a big way.

905
00:29:29,221 --> 00:29:30,750
And the movie is coming out soon too.

906
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:35,640
And I know that he went so far as to
reference 50 shades of grey in his

907
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:36,474
argument.

908
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:41,070
Meaning that in some way he
felt that that enabled him,

909
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:42,423
uh,

910
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,353
some leeway.

911
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,020
Yeah.

912
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:44,720
Right.

913
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:44,960
It's,

914
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,161
that's,

915
00:29:45,161 --> 00:29:45,490
that's,

916
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:45,870
that's,

917
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:48,610
that was a really weird
thing to me is like the,

918
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:53,940
the acceptability of that way of doing
things like between what somebody wants

919
00:29:53,981 --> 00:29:54,940
to do and doesn't want to do.

920
00:29:54,941 --> 00:29:55,151
I mean,

921
00:29:55,151 --> 00:29:56,860
when you're engaging
with somebody sexually,

922
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:57,910
how do you,

923
00:29:58,930 --> 00:29:59,950
if all of a sudden,

924
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:04,900
culturally you have this huge book
that x number of women reads or read,

925
00:30:04,901 --> 00:30:05,650
sorry,

926
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:08,560
how much more likely are
they to put up with that?

927
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,423
Even if it's not,

928
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:10,480
you know what I'm saying?

929
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,370
What I'm trying to get at?

930
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:11,661
Yeah.

931
00:30:11,661 --> 00:30:16,430
I D is that book about beating
them up a 50 shades of grey?

932
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:16,920
I Dunno.

933
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,090
I,

934
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:17,490
I don't,

935
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:22,490
I think it's just mostly just rough
sex and bondage tying up a whipping,

936
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:24,663
that kind of shit.

937
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:26,643
But I think he did.

938
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:31,030
I think it exposed a world of
sexual fantasy that wasn't,

939
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:31,691
I mean,

940
00:30:31,691 --> 00:30:33,130
that shit was so mainstream.

941
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:34,403
Yeah.

942
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:34,960
You know,

943
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,930
I think for the average
soccer mom or whatever,

944
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:39,080
it wasn't in,

945
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:40,180
in their lexicon,

946
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,360
pre 50 shades of gray.

947
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:43,461
Now I'm not,

948
00:30:43,461 --> 00:30:45,020
I'm not blaming the book or whatever.

949
00:30:45,021 --> 00:30:45,340
I mean,

950
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,540
people are going to do
what they're gonna do.

951
00:30:46,541 --> 00:30:49,630
And this guy was obviously behaving
that way long before based on the

952
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,510
accusations long before
that book even came out.

953
00:30:52,511 --> 00:30:53,290
But,

954
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:54,123
uh,

955
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,480
it seems to me that he,

956
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:56,980
his point is that,

957
00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:00,430
or at least his defense is
that this was simply rough sex.

958
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:00,960
Right?

959
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,793
Right.

960
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:05,470
And that was working for him for a
bit because the initial accusations,

961
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,300
as far as I know,

962
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,370
were sexual partners.

963
00:31:09,371 --> 00:31:10,480
He had had girlfriends,

964
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:10,810
right.

965
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:14,350
But then these other accusations started
coming out about girls who wouldn't

966
00:31:14,351 --> 00:31:14,981
participate,

967
00:31:14,981 --> 00:31:15,550
who are just getting,

968
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:18,250
showing up and getting beat
up and being asked to leave.

969
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,350
And there was no sexual element at all.

970
00:31:20,351 --> 00:31:21,330
So it,

971
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:21,720
you know,

972
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,280
it appears that the guy has some kind of,

973
00:31:24,281 --> 00:31:25,114
uh,

974
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,133
issue.

975
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:27,323
Uh,

976
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:29,650
I don't know why it's so disturbing to me,

977
00:31:29,651 --> 00:31:31,000
but what,

978
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:36,420
what gets me is these guys that
are like these really sweet like,

979
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:37,900
like,

980
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,550
like soft-spoken,

981
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,091
like you know,

982
00:31:40,091 --> 00:31:40,281
you,

983
00:31:40,281 --> 00:31:40,430
you,

984
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:41,890
you just picture him cuddling.

985
00:31:41,891 --> 00:31:43,210
You couldn't even picture him fucking,

986
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:44,403
you know what I mean?

987
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:48,580
Like I couldn't picture that guy with
stuffing a girl in the corner of a couch

988
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,110
fucking hammering away.

989
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:53,200
I wouldn't think of him being doing
anything going down in that way.

990
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:53,771
In that way.

991
00:31:53,771 --> 00:31:58,120
You almost see them as more of a
Predator like the printer because psycho

992
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,610
fucking Ted Bundy type sociopath.

993
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:05,820
Well there's something about someone
who is like really like projects,

994
00:32:06,521 --> 00:32:09,730
an image and the image is like
the like the Cosby situation.

995
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,680
Perfect example projects.

996
00:32:11,681 --> 00:32:13,120
This image of this wholesome,

997
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:18,300
super squeaky clean family man who doesn't
swear admonishes of the comedians for

998
00:32:18,551 --> 00:32:20,590
swearing using bad words,

999
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:23,020
talking about sex gets really angry.

1000
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:23,920
Them calls them up.

1001
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:29,040
The famous Eddie Murphy bit where Bill
Cosby calls him up and tells him to stop

1002
00:32:30,041 --> 00:32:34,200
swearing and then he calls up Richard
Pryor and Richard Pryor tells him did,

1003
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:35,020
did people laugh?

1004
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:35,890
Did you get paid?

1005
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,680
Tell bill to have a coke and
a smile and shut the fuck up.

1006
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:39,810
Classic.

1007
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:40,220
Right.

1008
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:40,670
Well you do.

1009
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,650
And when the guy and Richard
Pryor who's just fucking,

1010
00:32:42,651 --> 00:32:43,640
everything's on the table,

1011
00:32:43,641 --> 00:32:43,910
man,

1012
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:45,510
everything's on the table and scold.

1013
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:46,130
Yeah.

1014
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,790
Light himself on fire.

1015
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,110
Comfortable to know
where you stand with it.

1016
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:50,780
Yeah,

1017
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,890
that's my dog.

1018
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:52,271
Yeah,

1019
00:32:52,271 --> 00:32:52,531
yeah,

1020
00:32:52,531 --> 00:32:52,760
yeah,

1021
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,780
yeah man.

1022
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,550
If you're willing to go that far on that,

1023
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,620
then you're probably not hiding anything.

1024
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,990
There's nothing scarier
than somebody hiding shit.

1025
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,460
Exactly when you think about it.

1026
00:33:01,461 --> 00:33:06,461
But the interesting thing about the Cosby
situation is that it's the accusations

1027
00:33:06,801 --> 00:33:07,670
or date rape,

1028
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:09,411
which to me is,

1029
00:33:09,411 --> 00:33:09,780
well I don't,

1030
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,760
wouldn't even say date rape.

1031
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:12,530
I would say rape and I would say,

1032
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,130
well the war,

1033
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:14,170
the worst kind of race,

1034
00:33:14,171 --> 00:33:14,421
sorry,

1035
00:33:14,421 --> 00:33:15,980
I was referring just to the drug.

1036
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:16,340
Right?

1037
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:19,230
Like it wasn't date rape
in the sense that like uh,

1038
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:19,500
he,

1039
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:19,790
you know,

1040
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:20,720
he was on a date or whatever.

1041
00:33:20,721 --> 00:33:25,220
Like he held him down like he
did the difference in that.

1042
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,760
I'm not saying it's any different in,

1043
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:30,590
it's not any more excusable
or anything like that.

1044
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,140
I know.

1045
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:31,461
All,

1046
00:33:31,461 --> 00:33:32,660
I'm all I'm saying is that,

1047
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,793
uh,

1048
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,350
trying to prosecute that,

1049
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:37,903
oh,

1050
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,270
your,

1051
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,620
your point is the,

1052
00:33:39,621 --> 00:33:40,250
what's the woman,

1053
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,210
what's the story?

1054
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:42,250
What's the,

1055
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:42,730
the,

1056
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:43,580
the accusation.

1057
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:44,443
I was,

1058
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,920
I was completely cognizant.

1059
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:47,660
I woke up in somebody else's clothes,

1060
00:33:47,661 --> 00:33:48,440
like I read her,

1061
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,130
her account,

1062
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:50,000
the original,

1063
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:50,811
uh,

1064
00:33:50,811 --> 00:33:55,430
accuser who nobody was listening to at
least for the first few years after the

1065
00:33:55,431 --> 00:33:56,264
accusation.

1066
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:56,900
Uh,

1067
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,040
I woke up in his apartment,

1068
00:33:58,041 --> 00:34:01,610
don't know how I got there
and I was wearing his clothing
and I was throwing up.

1069
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,020
That's the accusation,

1070
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:03,470
right?

1071
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:03,920
Right.

1072
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,071
Well,

1073
00:34:04,071 --> 00:34:05,090
what a woman has to do,

1074
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:05,600
well,

1075
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,280
I shouldn't say I shouldn't
put it on the woman,

1076
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:11,390
but the only way to prove is
to immediately get a drug test,

1077
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,860
uh,

1078
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:13,760
call the cops.

1079
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:14,960
And you know,

1080
00:34:14,961 --> 00:34:15,231
I mean,

1081
00:34:15,231 --> 00:34:19,010
but a lot of women in those scenarios
are fucking terrified and scared.

1082
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:22,400
And not only that you're dealing
with like way back into the 60s.

1083
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:23,780
And there was,

1084
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,170
you know,

1085
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:27,510
like what kind of drug tests
were even available back then?

1086
00:34:27,511 --> 00:34:27,690
We,

1087
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,180
what could they test for?

1088
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,431
How could they please?

1089
00:34:30,431 --> 00:34:33,450
So the drug itself and that
happening to people was so new.

1090
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,293
Right.

1091
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,560
I don't even know that somebody would,

1092
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:40,550
we would realize the steps
necessary and maybe he had the gun.

1093
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,050
But imagine you're that.

1094
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:42,801
What was,

1095
00:34:42,801 --> 00:34:44,600
she was like 18 at the time.

1096
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,160
You're her and you're,

1097
00:34:46,161 --> 00:34:50,480
you want to make an accusation against
bill fucking Cosby and nobody wants to

1098
00:34:50,481 --> 00:34:51,530
listen to nobody.

1099
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:51,891
I mean,

1100
00:34:51,891 --> 00:34:54,110
he's a giant superstar.

1101
00:34:54,111 --> 00:34:54,590
I mean,

1102
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:59,590
he was a superstar in the 60s I believe
his first TV show us in 65 I think I

1103
00:35:00,591 --> 00:35:01,424
spy.

1104
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,091
I mean,

1105
00:35:02,091 --> 00:35:04,700
he was an Emmy award winner
a lot before I was born.

1106
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:05,240
Crazy.

1107
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,073
You know,

1108
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,310
and that,

1109
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,620
the thing that kills
me though is that like,

1110
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,230
like this Ghomeshi guy,

1111
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:15,170
he was this like sweet guy.

1112
00:35:15,171 --> 00:35:15,691
Like you,

1113
00:35:15,691 --> 00:35:15,951
you,

1114
00:35:15,951 --> 00:35:17,300
you saw him as this,

1115
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,810
you know the father figure on
the Huxtables and he had this,

1116
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:25,370
you can never imagine that guy dropping
Queloz into a chick's drank and just,

1117
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:31,210
it's so fucked up and it's almost more
fucked up than if the allegations are

1118
00:35:32,721 --> 00:35:33,470
like,

1119
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:35,300
let's pick a guy like old dirty bastard.

1120
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,613
You know what I mean?

1121
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:37,620
Rest,

1122
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,040
rest in

1123
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,520
peace.

1124
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,470
But if old dirty bastard
did something awful,

1125
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:40,831
you would go,

1126
00:35:40,831 --> 00:35:41,191
well let's,

1127
00:35:41,191 --> 00:35:41,431
you know,

1128
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:45,330
like I was shocked because you know
where you stand with old dirty.

1129
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:45,870
Yeah,

1130
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:46,170
right,

1131
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:46,410
right.

1132
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,300
You meet old dirty or
like I already get it man.

1133
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:48,961
You know,

1134
00:35:48,961 --> 00:35:50,850
and not to say that he was a rapist,

1135
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:52,711
but yeah,

1136
00:35:52,711 --> 00:35:53,131
it's,

1137
00:35:53,131 --> 00:35:54,720
there is something creepy about,

1138
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:55,170
uh,

1139
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,820
you know the whole Ted Bundy character,

1140
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,580
how old dirty bastard is probably
less likely to do that too,

1141
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,110
which is more fucked up.

1142
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:01,590
Right.

1143
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:03,680
He was probably a guy who just like,

1144
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,090
because women knew what you mean.

1145
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,060
Look at his gold grill.

1146
00:36:06,061 --> 00:36:10,950
You knew what the fuck because the
creepiest people are the best actors.

1147
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:11,810
Right,

1148
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:12,030
right.

1149
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:15,270
The creepiest people or the guy who
talked to you on the radio like this and

1150
00:36:15,271 --> 00:36:18,210
then get you alone and you fucking
cotton punch in the face like,

1151
00:36:18,211 --> 00:36:19,044
whoa.

1152
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,610
You imagine and up.

1153
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:24,570
Especially if you're a woman and you're
into those like emo dudes and you see

1154
00:36:24,571 --> 00:36:25,081
him and you're like,

1155
00:36:25,081 --> 00:36:25,231
oh,

1156
00:36:25,231 --> 00:36:26,070
this guy is sweet,

1157
00:36:26,071 --> 00:36:28,920
he's going to cuddle and I'll be able to
get really close to him before we have

1158
00:36:28,921 --> 00:36:29,510
sex.

1159
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:30,840
Know he's punching you in the head,

1160
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:34,230
stuff in your head under a pillow
and tried to suffocate you itself.

1161
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:38,460
It must be such a mind fuck to be
in that scenario after the fact.

1162
00:36:38,461 --> 00:36:38,641
You know,

1163
00:36:38,641 --> 00:36:40,260
to find yourself there and be like,

1164
00:36:40,261 --> 00:36:40,980
wow,

1165
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,300
that was not expected.

1166
00:36:42,301 --> 00:36:43,500
STANDUP citizen,

1167
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:45,150
we're assuming he did this by the way.

1168
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,400
I mean we don't to be careful.

1169
00:36:47,401 --> 00:36:49,080
He's tried to sue the CBC,

1170
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:50,380
but he did.

1171
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,061
He dropped,

1172
00:36:51,061 --> 00:36:51,720
dropped it.

1173
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:51,931
Well,

1174
00:36:51,931 --> 00:36:52,920
if you drop it,

1175
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:56,070
I mean if you're suing and you're in the
middle of the stuff he's charged now.

1176
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,650
He's charged now as of
a couple of days ago.

1177
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:00,390
So yeah,

1178
00:37:00,391 --> 00:37:01,140
I mean he's not,

1179
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,490
he's not convicted yet,

1180
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:06,960
but there are a number of accusations
on the table and that's gonna that can't

1181
00:37:06,961 --> 00:37:07,794
bode well for him.

1182
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:08,890
Yeah.

1183
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:09,270
Oh,

1184
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:12,600
who the fuck knows what actually
happened in that particular case?

1185
00:37:12,601 --> 00:37:17,601
But what just drives me up the wall is
that someone's capable of doing that.

1186
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:18,863
It's,

1187
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,291
it's,

1188
00:37:19,291 --> 00:37:21,630
it goes back and is sort
of a very loose way.

1189
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:24,180
It goes back to what we're
talking about with Ferguson.

1190
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:27,300
It's like our real issue when
it comes to any kind of a crime,

1191
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:29,040
any kind of a horrible scenario,

1192
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:33,960
is what turns a person into the
type of person that can do that.

1193
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,290
What turns what turns a
person into the type of kid.

1194
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,870
But whatever Michael Brown did,

1195
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:41,280
we know he robbed a store.

1196
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:44,430
We know there's a photo of him
grabbing some guy by the neck.

1197
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,870
He's a giant guy.

1198
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,190
We know that.

1199
00:37:47,191 --> 00:37:47,731
He did that.

1200
00:37:47,731 --> 00:37:47,800
Oh,

1201
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,330
so what could you have done that
when you were 18 I couldn't have,

1202
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,710
I wasn't a violent person.

1203
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,860
I was violent and it's right
in the sense of us fighting.

1204
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,600
But you had an outlet.

1205
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:58,261
But yeah,

1206
00:37:58,261 --> 00:37:59,070
my outlet,

1207
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,060
I mean I was never,

1208
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,013
I never,

1209
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:01,620
I hadn't,

1210
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:05,610
I haven't even gotten into a
scuffle since I was in high school.

1211
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,770
Like I've had z maybe
one time I'm fear factor,

1212
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,990
but the one time I fear factor.

1213
00:38:09,991 --> 00:38:10,860
I didn't even hurt the guy.

1214
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:11,850
I just grabbed him.

1215
00:38:11,851 --> 00:38:12,870
I didn't do anything to him.

1216
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:13,500
I just,

1217
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,000
I thought he was gonna
hit me the question.

1218
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:15,420
Yeah.

1219
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:19,520
The question is what
makes a person like that?

1220
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,780
How much of it is nature nurture,

1221
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:24,930
so almost it's huge
chunk of it is nurture,

1222
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:25,260
right?

1223
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,093
Huge chunk,

1224
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,720
but nature and nurture are
combined because of epic,

1225
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,710
epic genetics and there's
learned behavior there.

1226
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,270
There's,

1227
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:35,130
there's tendencies that a child,

1228
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:38,560
if they're in the womb of a mother who
was under extreme stress and duress,

1229
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,510
a woman who's,

1230
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:41,980
it lives in a horrible neighborhood
of deals with violence in the home.

1231
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:44,740
A woman who's being beaten
while she's pregnant,

1232
00:38:44,741 --> 00:38:48,420
that child will have a higher
propensity for violence like this is,

1233
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:52,330
there's all these studies that have
proven this are being done to prove this

1234
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:53,500
you,

1235
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,550
everyone's on equal.

1236
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:58,900
If your parents are super sweet and in
love with each other and super supportive

1237
00:38:58,901 --> 00:39:02,830
and you grew up and you're in the womb
of that mom and then there's this kid

1238
00:39:02,831 --> 00:39:07,510
who's mom is getting beat up by the dad
who is a junkie who comes home every

1239
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:11,770
three days and it's just chaos
and violence and fear and crying.

1240
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:12,420
You're a D,

1241
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,410
you're growing up a different person.

1242
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:18,130
So if you're in that circumstance and
you're part of a greater group of people

1243
00:39:18,131 --> 00:39:20,740
who have also had that
same experience coming up,

1244
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,300
are you really,

1245
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:27,360
do you really have the
capacity to understand how
your actions are affecting the

1246
00:39:29,771 --> 00:39:30,610
entire picture?

1247
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,900
That's a great question.

1248
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,280
That's the real question,

1249
00:39:33,281 --> 00:39:33,730
right?

1250
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:34,600
That's the real question.

1251
00:39:34,601 --> 00:39:39,601
The real question is isn't whether or
not that cop shot that guy in in a just

1252
00:39:39,971 --> 00:39:40,301
way.

1253
00:39:40,301 --> 00:39:42,100
The real question is how?

1254
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:45,640
How do we stop a kid
like that from being kid?

1255
00:39:45,641 --> 00:39:49,150
Like how do we stop an
angry young man from,

1256
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,950
from developing into a criminal?

1257
00:39:50,951 --> 00:39:52,270
How do you intervene?

1258
00:39:52,271 --> 00:39:53,620
Is it possible to intervene?

1259
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:56,110
Is it possible to
intervene with counseling?

1260
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:01,260
Is it possible to intervene with education
or is there some sort of a medical

1261
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:03,850
pharmaceutical alternative
that's on the horizon?

1262
00:40:03,851 --> 00:40:04,001
I mean,

1263
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:06,190
who the fuck knows what,

1264
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:06,700
what,

1265
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:09,400
what turns someone into what's,

1266
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:09,560
well,

1267
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,120
you know,

1268
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:10,990
fill in the blank.

1269
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:13,900
There's a million instances
all across the country,

1270
00:40:13,901 --> 00:40:16,870
every day of people committing
violent crimes and it's,

1271
00:40:16,871 --> 00:40:17,091
and it,

1272
00:40:17,091 --> 00:40:17,350
and,

1273
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:18,910
and to be fair,

1274
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,070
it's not just this,

1275
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,750
this part of the populous.

1276
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:24,700
It's not just somebody who came up,

1277
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:25,540
uh,

1278
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,500
without very much,

1279
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:26,860
well,

1280
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,680
that's why this Ghomeshi
guys kind of fuss.

1281
00:40:28,681 --> 00:40:28,991
I mean,

1282
00:40:28,991 --> 00:40:31,630
or I remember the kid in Santa Barbara,

1283
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:32,680
the rich kid,

1284
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,670
yes.

1285
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:36,850
Who had had it out for women or whatever.

1286
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:37,570
I read,

1287
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:40,030
read some stuff for regarding
him when that happened.

1288
00:40:40,031 --> 00:40:41,560
So yeah,

1289
00:40:41,561 --> 00:40:42,940
it can happen anywhere,

1290
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,000
but it's obvious that violence among
particular communities is vastly more,

1291
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:50,853
uh,

1292
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:51,621
consistent.

1293
00:40:51,621 --> 00:40:51,711
Yeah.

1294
00:40:51,711 --> 00:40:52,770
Impoverished communities.

1295
00:40:52,771 --> 00:40:53,740
It's just more stress,

1296
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:54,581
more stress,

1297
00:40:54,581 --> 00:40:55,361
more violence,

1298
00:40:55,361 --> 00:40:56,380
more poverty.

1299
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:01,440
Did you hear this hope that they found
that Mcdonald's is spending significantly

1300
00:41:02,831 --> 00:41:06,250
more money advertising important
neighborhoods recently?

1301
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:06,641
Yeah,

1302
00:41:06,641 --> 00:41:07,451
they did a study.

1303
00:41:07,451 --> 00:41:08,284
They're like,

1304
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,480
I don't even remember
what the percentage was.

1305
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:13,060
I hate quoting things that
I don't have the data on.

1306
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:14,710
Maybe Jamie can look it up.

1307
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:15,131
Yeah,

1308
00:41:15,131 --> 00:41:15,580
Jamie could.

1309
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,060
Um,

1310
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,440
but yeah,

1311
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:20,140
that maybe runs even deeper than this.

1312
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:20,830
Right?

1313
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:21,310
As you,

1314
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:22,143
I mean,

1315
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:23,860
you know the like how does,

1316
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:25,810
how does nutrition play into it?

1317
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:26,531
Right.

1318
00:41:26,531 --> 00:41:27,460
And that's a good point.

1319
00:41:27,461 --> 00:41:27,881
You know what I mean?

1320
00:41:27,881 --> 00:41:31,000
Sugar is a big part of
the Diet of poor people.

1321
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:35,630
I mean not just sugar but
sugar in refined form,

1322
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,670
whether whether it's candy or soda,

1323
00:41:37,671 --> 00:41:40,940
but also in terms of like
breads and carbohydrates.

1324
00:41:40,941 --> 00:41:43,370
It's all like an alcohol
upon those things.

1325
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:44,330
Meat Processing,

1326
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:45,040
the sugar.

1327
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:45,551
If you,

1328
00:41:45,551 --> 00:41:46,384
uh,

1329
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:51,540
if you're a poor family and you
can go to Mcdonald's and get a,

1330
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:52,181
you know,

1331
00:41:52,181 --> 00:41:56,930
a bunch of meals for five bucks
a piece and it's weird how,

1332
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,450
how many things are stacked against you.

1333
00:41:58,451 --> 00:42:00,380
It's just weird like that the fund,

1334
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:05,200
the building blocks of human life
like vegetables or whatever are,

1335
00:42:05,201 --> 00:42:05,470
are,

1336
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:06,940
are not accessible to you.

1337
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,290
At least not,

1338
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:11,560
not in the same way as those
other ready made meals.

1339
00:42:11,561 --> 00:42:12,394
Like,

1340
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,330
cause you've got to cook them.

1341
00:42:13,331 --> 00:42:14,110
You got to,

1342
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:16,960
the investment isn't just the
amount of money that it costs.

1343
00:42:16,961 --> 00:42:21,961
Cause I've seen those responses like well
you know they could buy vegetables and

1344
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,381
this and that,

1345
00:42:23,381 --> 00:42:28,381
but when you're working two jobs and
you're a single parent and whatever else

1346
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:33,930
that the energy invested in actually
turning that vege those vegetables into

1347
00:42:34,091 --> 00:42:35,500
something your kids actually want.

1348
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:37,120
Is this it right here?

1349
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:37,270
Yeah.

1350
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:41,050
This is the disturbing ways that fast
food chains disproportionately target

1351
00:42:41,051 --> 00:42:41,884
black kids,

1352
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:43,120
specifically McDonald's.

1353
00:42:43,121 --> 00:42:46,630
But it's a lot of Papa John's
Popeye's and Mcdonald's in there.

1354
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:46,991
Sorry,

1355
00:42:46,991 --> 00:42:48,100
I may have accused him.

1356
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:50,370
Well they,

1357
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,800
they go where they can
make the most money.

1358
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:56,130
I mean it's like a magnet
attracts metal filings.

1359
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:57,570
Well how do you feel about that?

1360
00:42:58,250 --> 00:42:59,083
Is this,

1361
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,060
is this acceptable?

1362
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:01,320
Well,

1363
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,310
sorry to put you on the spot.

1364
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,173
Here's the thing.

1365
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:05,490
In an ideal society,

1366
00:43:05,491 --> 00:43:08,760
like if you Louis would like a big Mac,

1367
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,020
you should be able to buy a big Mac.

1368
00:43:10,021 --> 00:43:10,651
I completely agree.

1369
00:43:10,651 --> 00:43:10,861
No,

1370
00:43:10,861 --> 00:43:12,180
that a big Mac is shit.

1371
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:13,070
You know,

1372
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:14,130
it's not good for you.

1373
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,910
But if you have to choose between going
down the street to whole foods and

1374
00:43:17,911 --> 00:43:20,240
getting a nice salad that's super healthy,

1375
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:22,740
nutrient dense or a big Mac,

1376
00:43:22,741 --> 00:43:25,110
and you choose as an
adult to go get a big Mac,

1377
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,153
that's one thing.

1378
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:27,343
But the,

1379
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:31,710
there's a big difference between
that and children and you know,

1380
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:31,821
and,

1381
00:43:31,821 --> 00:43:32,060
and,

1382
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:35,310
and people that aren't educated
or people that are poor,

1383
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:39,480
I don't think that Mcdonald's or
burger king has a responsibility.

1384
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:42,230
Should they be able to
advertise to miners?

1385
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:43,100
Two miners,

1386
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:43,301
she's,

1387
00:43:43,301 --> 00:43:45,210
this show will do whatever they
want as long as it's legal.

1388
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:45,631
I mean,

1389
00:43:45,631 --> 00:43:45,840
look,

1390
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,210
if you want to serve
your kid a cheeseburger,

1391
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,380
it should that be illegal.

1392
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:50,250
If your kid,

1393
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:50,541
okay,

1394
00:43:50,541 --> 00:43:51,390
your five year old says,

1395
00:43:51,391 --> 00:43:51,631
Daddy,

1396
00:43:51,631 --> 00:43:52,520
I want a cheeseburger.

1397
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:52,860
Like,

1398
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:53,350
all right,

1399
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:55,800
well let's go in there
and get a cheeseburger.

1400
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:57,480
Is that it?

1401
00:43:57,481 --> 00:43:58,380
Should that be okay?

1402
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,640
And if that's okay.

1403
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:00,330
Why?

1404
00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:00,601
I mean,

1405
00:44:00,601 --> 00:44:02,480
if it's okay to go to an ice cream store,

1406
00:44:02,481 --> 00:44:05,220
if it's okay to go to Baskin Robbins
and get your kid in ice cream Sundae,

1407
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:07,590
which pretty much everybody
does every now and again.

1408
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:08,620
But here's the,

1409
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:11,110
here's what I'm getting at is that the,

1410
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:15,220
the developing mind is very susceptible,

1411
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:20,670
at least traditionally has
been susceptible to this to
advertising's ability to,

1412
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,420
to bypass the,

1413
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:22,810
the,

1414
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:23,140
the,

1415
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:26,110
the defense mechanisms
that an adult brain has.

1416
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:26,410
Right?

1417
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:27,820
I know you want to sell me something,

1418
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:28,180
right?

1419
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:29,950
I know that big Mac
looks fucking delicious.

1420
00:44:29,951 --> 00:44:30,820
I'm going to come by it.

1421
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:31,150
Right,

1422
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:31,271
right,

1423
00:44:31,271 --> 00:44:31,890
right.

1424
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:32,070
But

1425
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,800
maybe the like longterm embedding them,

1426
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:39,360
embedding themselves in the psyche of
people at a young enough age is somehow

1427
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:43,800
affecting their decision making
far later into their lives.

1428
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,290
That is not just a simple discussion of,

1429
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:47,130
you know,

1430
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:48,620
an advertisement tomorrow and,

1431
00:44:48,621 --> 00:44:50,610
and free choice tomorrow.

1432
00:44:50,611 --> 00:44:53,400
Like how free are we actually
when it comes to thinking,

1433
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:54,340
right?

1434
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:54,780
Yeah.

1435
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:55,613
Well

1436
00:44:57,630 --> 00:44:58,290
it's very,

1437
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:03,090
it's a very complicated and
complex situation because
what is okay for one group

1438
00:45:03,091 --> 00:45:04,200
is not okay for another,

1439
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:09,360
what is okay for adults discerning
adults who are educated and aware.

1440
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,210
If you want to go get a snickers bar,

1441
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,140
you should be able to.

1442
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:14,220
But if,

1443
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:19,220
if that is all that's available in your
community and you are young and starving

1444
00:45:19,501 --> 00:45:20,790
and you don't have much money,

1445
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:24,720
then that's a real issue because like
this kid needs nutrition and they're not

1446
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:27,390
getting it from a
snickers bar or a big Mac.

1447
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:28,750
And it would be interesting to,

1448
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:29,160
to,

1449
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:33,660
to attempt to investigate the consequences
of that from a mental perspective.

1450
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:39,330
Like is it possible to have a fully
developed mind living off snickers is not

1451
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:40,620
and I don't think so.

1452
00:45:40,621 --> 00:45:43,770
Even if it's whether or
not it's fully developed,

1453
00:45:43,771 --> 00:45:45,000
it's not going to be optimized.

1454
00:45:45,001 --> 00:45:45,211
No,

1455
00:45:45,211 --> 00:45:45,830
that's for sure.

1456
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:46,290
No,

1457
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:47,490
and the effects of that at at,

1458
00:45:47,491 --> 00:45:48,121
at a young age,

1459
00:45:48,121 --> 00:45:48,954
so it's,

1460
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:50,430
it's not,

1461
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:53,700
it's not like it's an old thing
from a human history perspective,

1462
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,920
like the food that would
have been available,

1463
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:59,580
it may have been available more to
the rich people than the poor people.

1464
00:45:59,581 --> 00:46:01,710
But you're talking about
roughly the same stuff,

1465
00:46:01,711 --> 00:46:02,370
right?

1466
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:06,030
It comes out of the ground or are you
or you kill a cow and whatever you got

1467
00:46:06,031 --> 00:46:06,864
what you got.

1468
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:07,500
No.

1469
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:07,681
Well,

1470
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:11,850
I think what we really need
with communities really
need is community gardens

1471
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:13,380
and you know,

1472
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:18,380
it would also foster a massive sense of
community if you had community gardens

1473
00:46:18,391 --> 00:46:21,210
where like say if you live on a block,

1474
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,220
all you would need is one lot.

1475
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:23,881
Okay.

1476
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:24,091
You know,

1477
00:46:24,091 --> 00:46:26,040
you have a hundred homes on a block,

1478
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:29,160
one of them one lot with v feed.

1479
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:30,750
Literally a hundred homes.

1480
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:32,730
You would just have to grow it correctly,

1481
00:46:32,731 --> 00:46:32,941
you know,

1482
00:46:32,941 --> 00:46:36,030
stagger the food and
have everyone do shifts.

1483
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:39,870
If you have a hundred
families doing shifts in this,

1484
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,111
you know,

1485
00:46:40,111 --> 00:46:42,030
one half acre a lot,

1486
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:46,350
I mean a half acre is a lot of
land as far as like growing food.

1487
00:46:46,351 --> 00:46:48,780
If you have access to water
and seeds and all these,

1488
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:49,650
the,

1489
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:50,040
you know,

1490
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,620
the proper soil to for growing food,

1491
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:55,440
you could do an amazing
thing with an area.

1492
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,513
When I was a kid,

1493
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:58,500
my parents were involved in,

1494
00:46:58,501 --> 00:46:58,710
um,

1495
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:00,300
my stepdad was going to school,

1496
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:03,630
he was a computer programmer and he went
back to school to become an architect.

1497
00:47:03,631 --> 00:47:06,810
And when he changed careers,

1498
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:07,530
he,

1499
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:08,490
when he was going to school,

1500
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:13,230
he was involved at one point in time
with some project at his university where

1501
00:47:13,231 --> 00:47:13,831
they were,

1502
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:14,430
um,

1503
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:18,870
they had like a communal garden sort of
a thing and everyone had to do like a

1504
00:47:18,871 --> 00:47:19,704
shift.

1505
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:22,620
And I remember this very clearly because
I went with him one day and I got

1506
00:47:22,621 --> 00:47:23,760
attacked by a goat.

1507
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:25,680
Fucking conti.

1508
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:29,560
Goats jumped after me and they
had livestock at Guardian.

1509
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:29,721
Yeah,

1510
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:29,870
yeah,

1511
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:30,400
yeah,

1512
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:30,521
yeah.

1513
00:47:30,521 --> 00:47:30,911
They were,

1514
00:47:30,911 --> 00:47:33,210
they were milking goats and uh,

1515
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,151
it was a part of,

1516
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:34,984
I don't,

1517
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:38,530
I was about maybe eight at the time,

1518
00:47:38,531 --> 00:47:39,364
maybe seven or eight.

1519
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:44,500
So I do not remember the exact extent
of their duties are what everything but

1520
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,150
what everything was for.

1521
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:48,850
But I remember there was all
sorts of different vegetables.

1522
00:47:48,851 --> 00:47:50,860
They were growing and then
they had some livestock,

1523
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:51,733
I think they were using.

1524
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:54,010
Goat's milk is particularly nutritious.

1525
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:54,580
Yeah.

1526
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,230
Very easy to digest as well.

1527
00:47:56,231 --> 00:47:58,120
And it's an issue with babies.

1528
00:47:58,121 --> 00:48:00,160
A lot of babies have a real
hard time with cow milk.

1529
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:01,023
My daughter did.

1530
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:02,920
It should a really hard
time drinking cow milk.

1531
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:06,070
But goat's milk is super easy
to digest for whatever reason.

1532
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,740
I don't know nutritionally
bubs or whatever.

1533
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:10,300
But that idea,

1534
00:48:10,301 --> 00:48:12,550
that concept of a communal garden,

1535
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:16,750
I mean first of all it could bring the
community together and amazing way,

1536
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:20,920
you know where everybody's sort of working
towards some sort of a universal goal

1537
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:21,821
and two,

1538
00:48:21,821 --> 00:48:26,821
it could provide people with food that
either don't need money to pay for if

1539
00:48:27,281 --> 00:48:28,114
they can just,

1540
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:28,720
you know,

1541
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,630
if everybody has a shift that
they have to do like hey,

1542
00:48:31,631 --> 00:48:35,140
it's your shift to lay down
manure or your shift to pick up,

1543
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:35,590
you know,

1544
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:37,180
the crops and document them.

1545
00:48:37,181 --> 00:48:38,014
And if you have like,

1546
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:38,441
you know,

1547
00:48:38,441 --> 00:48:41,860
a log book that everybody
has to sign in and you know,

1548
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,020
today we picked 18 squash,

1549
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:45,100
we put them here,

1550
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:45,430
you know,

1551
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:46,270
let everybody know,

1552
00:48:46,271 --> 00:48:47,470
send the word out.

1553
00:48:47,471 --> 00:48:49,630
Squash is available to families,

1554
00:48:49,631 --> 00:48:50,690
come and get some squash.

1555
00:48:50,691 --> 00:48:50,861
You know,

1556
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:52,300
the Kale is grown to the point.

1557
00:48:52,301 --> 00:48:57,301
We could pick it that that's all possible
and not like economically prohibitive.

1558
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,850
And it would probably save a
lot of people a lot of money.

1559
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,930
I think that makes a lot of sense.

1560
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:05,010
Most definitely.

1561
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:08,290
But I think for me it's like you won,

1562
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:11,250
you wonder how much time plays into it,

1563
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:11,760
right?

1564
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,760
Because when you like what comes with
money and wellbeing and growing up in a

1565
00:49:18,061 --> 00:49:20,910
good community and whatever is his time,

1566
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:21,863
free time,

1567
00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:23,160
free time,

1568
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,980
which is what allows not only uh,

1569
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:27,570
you know,

1570
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:28,740
things like that to exist,

1571
00:49:28,741 --> 00:49:30,300
but also the ideas,

1572
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:30,871
you know,

1573
00:49:30,871 --> 00:49:31,491
like the,

1574
00:49:31,491 --> 00:49:31,841
the,

1575
00:49:31,841 --> 00:49:32,050
the,

1576
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:35,070
the free format of
communication and ideas.

1577
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:39,720
When you subtract time from
people when they are getting paid,

1578
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:40,620
uh,

1579
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:41,220
you know,

1580
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:45,270
a fraction of whatever they get paid
per person is getting paid per hour or

1581
00:49:45,271 --> 00:49:45,631
whatever.

1582
00:49:45,631 --> 00:49:47,490
It's there or you know,

1583
00:49:47,491 --> 00:49:49,280
red lining there,

1584
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:50,010
their cape,

1585
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:50,880
their capacity,

1586
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:52,100
the,

1587
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:54,060
the age old work smarter,

1588
00:49:54,061 --> 00:49:55,500
not harder type scenario.

1589
00:49:55,501 --> 00:49:57,540
But it's like if,

1590
00:49:57,541 --> 00:49:58,374
uh,

1591
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:00,210
if time is not abundant,

1592
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:05,510
it's hard to imagine that people would
find a w what could find a way to

1593
00:50:05,521 --> 00:50:06,570
participate in something like [inaudible]

1594
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:10,150
is a guy named Ron Finley who's got
a Ted talk on this very subject,

1595
00:50:10,151 --> 00:50:10,720
right?

1596
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,790
He calls himself a guerrilla gardener.

1597
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:13,773
Wow.

1598
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:14,621
Yeah.

1599
00:50:14,621 --> 00:50:18,820
He's got a Ted talk about guerrilla
gardening and south central La and it's

1600
00:50:18,821 --> 00:50:19,750
really interesting.

1601
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:20,681
Yeah.

1602
00:50:20,681 --> 00:50:21,760
And he has,

1603
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:22,653
um,

1604
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:23,380
these,

1605
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:26,650
these gardens that he
set up and like medians,

1606
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:28,190
like growing food

1607
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:30,500
in all these places that
where nothing was growing,

1608
00:50:30,501 --> 00:50:35,480
but like weeds before only gets young
kids involved in growing this food.

1609
00:50:35,481 --> 00:50:36,314
And he's talking,

1610
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:36,750
you know,

1611
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:37,371
this ted talk,

1612
00:50:37,371 --> 00:50:39,830
it's really interesting because he's,

1613
00:50:39,831 --> 00:50:44,420
he's talking about how little it costs
and how healthy it is and how good it is

1614
00:50:44,421 --> 00:50:45,110
for you.

1615
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:45,540
Yeah.

1616
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:45,791
You know,

1617
00:50:45,791 --> 00:50:46,040
it's,

1618
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,720
it's a really to get him on here,

1619
00:50:47,721 --> 00:50:48,020
man.

1620
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:48,630
I got him.

1621
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:49,463
He's um,

1622
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:49,921
yeah,

1623
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:51,530
I mean he sounds like a bad if he has a,

1624
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:51,951
yeah.

1625
00:50:51,951 --> 00:50:53,040
I wonder if he has a Twitter foe.

1626
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:54,320
I'm sure he was at Twitter.

1627
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:58,790
It's funny though that if this stuff
is really as accessible as it seems,

1628
00:50:58,791 --> 00:51:01,400
it is like ground Sun rain,

1629
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:02,503
right.

1630
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:06,620
Why the hell does it cost
what it costs at whole foods?

1631
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:07,580
What's that about?

1632
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:09,110
Yeah.

1633
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:10,010
What is that about?

1634
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:10,371
I mean,

1635
00:51:10,371 --> 00:51:10,451
I,

1636
00:51:10,451 --> 00:51:15,451
when I got here and I was at the whole
foods in Venice and Jesus Christ,

1637
00:51:15,831 --> 00:51:17,030
that place is buzzing.

1638
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:18,080
It's a scene,

1639
00:51:18,081 --> 00:51:18,914
man.

1640
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:19,883
It's,

1641
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:20,720
it's like,

1642
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:21,560
it's like you're,

1643
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:21,860
you're,

1644
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:25,760
you're in some wacky
nutritional nightclub.

1645
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:31,730
They kind of like a little wine bar and
if people are sitting there talking,

1646
00:51:31,731 --> 00:51:33,560
sipping on expensive wines,

1647
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:34,581
you know,

1648
00:51:34,581 --> 00:51:38,690
buying the most expensive
products you possibly can.

1649
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:39,330
It's very,

1650
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:40,970
it's like a rite of passage.

1651
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,810
It's like nutrition is a rite of passage
as a place even more expensive called

1652
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,160
Erewhon who were been an Erewhon.

1653
00:51:46,161 --> 00:51:46,480
No,

1654
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,313
that's a new one

1655
00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:49,970
to the next level.

1656
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:50,930
Do they have a dress code?

1657
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:51,351
No,

1658
00:51:51,351 --> 00:51:54,580
but whole foods is better though because
whole foods has like a real butcher

1659
00:51:54,581 --> 00:51:54,921
shop.

1660
00:51:54,921 --> 00:51:55,551
Like whole foods.

1661
00:51:55,551 --> 00:51:57,710
You can get like a fat rice and steak.

1662
00:51:57,711 --> 00:51:58,010
Yeah,

1663
00:51:58,010 --> 00:51:58,581
I saw that.

1664
00:51:58,581 --> 00:51:59,930
Like good meat that,

1665
00:51:59,931 --> 00:52:02,150
I mean they even had smoked brisket.

1666
00:52:02,151 --> 00:52:05,380
Like they're smoking it right
there in the supermarket cheese.

1667
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:09,290
There's a whole food in boulder
that is like a God damn restaurant.

1668
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:10,650
I mean they have all sorts of,

1669
00:52:10,651 --> 00:52:11,750
or they have a pizza oven?

1670
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:12,160
Yeah,

1671
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:12,670
I have.

1672
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:13,700
They make sandwiches.

1673
00:52:13,701 --> 00:52:14,780
They have all sorts of stuff.

1674
00:52:14,781 --> 00:52:16,550
The one in Venice had
the wood pizza oven too.

1675
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:17,150
I tried it.

1676
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:18,380
It was bad ass pizza.

1677
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:20,540
Like I'm not taking
anything away from them.

1678
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,880
Better food for more people is awesome.

1679
00:52:22,881 --> 00:52:23,714
Expensive though.

1680
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:24,441
That's what I'm saying.

1681
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:25,101
So it's hard,

1682
00:52:25,101 --> 00:52:26,300
but price wise it's like,

1683
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:28,700
and I'm not trying to uh,

1684
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:29,960
be prejudice or anything,

1685
00:52:29,961 --> 00:52:31,850
but that is a type of
person that's in there.

1686
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:33,380
You know what I mean?

1687
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:34,130
I love how you said that.

1688
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:35,060
I'm not trying to be prejudice.

1689
00:52:35,530 --> 00:52:36,080
Um,

1690
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,990
I it is prejudice Twitter page called yes,

1691
00:52:38,991 --> 00:52:39,740
you're racist.

1692
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:39,861
Oh,

1693
00:52:39,861 --> 00:52:40,280
okay.

1694
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:40,880
And uh,

1695
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:45,800
I was tweeting it the other day because
it was a during the day of the riots,

1696
00:52:45,801 --> 00:52:47,180
it was a great time to go to,

1697
00:52:47,181 --> 00:52:47,481
yes,

1698
00:52:47,481 --> 00:52:48,314
you're racist.

1699
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:51,590
And they would find like
racist tweets and put them up.

1700
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:56,180
And the guy who runs the page was
saying that that was the worst day ever.

1701
00:52:56,210 --> 00:53:00,470
Worst than Trayvon Martin or
worse than any other that day.

1702
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:01,531
Well,

1703
00:53:01,531 --> 00:53:02,450
there was so much,

1704
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:04,880
so much racist bullshit being tweeted.

1705
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:05,780
Wow.

1706
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:06,131
I mean,

1707
00:53:06,131 --> 00:53:06,964
I believe it.

1708
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:08,780
I've been in the youtube comments before.

1709
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:09,620
It's,

1710
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,640
it seems like there'll be a way to,

1711
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:13,550
to mitigate a lot of the issues.

1712
00:53:13,551 --> 00:53:14,121
And this also,

1713
00:53:14,121 --> 00:53:14,310
it's,

1714
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:14,560
it's,

1715
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:18,530
it's also difficult to get
people to fucking eat that shit.

1716
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:20,480
Like they want eat cheeseburgers.

1717
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:20,810
Right.

1718
00:53:20,810 --> 00:53:21,021
You know,

1719
00:53:21,021 --> 00:53:22,420
it's not as simple as a,

1720
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:23,420
do you want some more coffee man?

1721
00:53:23,421 --> 00:53:24,260
Who wants to make small clubs?

1722
00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:24,990
I would love some more.

1723
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:26,430
This is fantastic coffee.

1724
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:27,080
I'm just,

1725
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:27,241
it's,

1726
00:53:27,241 --> 00:53:28,320
it's starting to sink in.

1727
00:53:28,321 --> 00:53:29,820
I'm getting fired up now.

1728
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:30,900
We got plumbing,

1729
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:31,733
caveman coffee.

1730
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:32,983
Right.

1731
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:33,710
Perfect.

1732
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:34,350
Um,

1733
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:34,820
it's,

1734
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:39,240
it's hard to get people to choose
a salad over a fucking ice cream,

1735
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:42,150
but I feel like it is prevailing.

1736
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:43,320
[inaudible] I mean,

1737
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:45,120
I don't know about when
you were a kid or whatever,

1738
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:47,370
but nobody was saying
Mcdonald's is bad for you.

1739
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:47,880
Right.

1740
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,710
Nobody was saying
cigarettes are bad for you.

1741
00:53:49,711 --> 00:53:50,940
At some point in time,

1742
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:51,600
you know,

1743
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:52,440
at some point in time,

1744
00:53:52,441 --> 00:53:54,570
doctors were prescribing things.

1745
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:58,950
Did you ever see that j Edgar
Hoover film know Capria Oh no,

1746
00:53:58,951 --> 00:53:59,610
I never saw it.

1747
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:00,390
It's a good movie.

1748
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:05,310
And one of the things in the movie was
Leonardo Dicaprio or j Edgar Hoover's mom

1749
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:08,310
telling Leonardo Dicaprio that he should,

1750
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:08,851
you know,

1751
00:54:08,851 --> 00:54:12,780
smoke the cigarettes that the doctor
prescribed to make him heartier,

1752
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:13,351
you know,

1753
00:54:13,351 --> 00:54:14,820
to make him more really

1754
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,500
prescribing cigarettes to
make you like refer stronger.

1755
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:20,483
No.

1756
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:21,231
Yay.

1757
00:54:21,231 --> 00:54:21,511
Yes.

1758
00:54:21,511 --> 00:54:24,180
Doctors prescribed cigarettes.

1759
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:24,840
Yeah.

1760
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:24,991
Well,

1761
00:54:24,991 --> 00:54:25,201
you know,

1762
00:54:25,201 --> 00:54:26,034
before the,

1763
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:31,160
before the vibrator
doctors would give yes.

1764
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,190
Hysteria,

1765
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:32,371
right?

1766
00:54:32,371 --> 00:54:32,700
Yes,

1767
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:32,971
yes.

1768
00:54:32,971 --> 00:54:37,971
Hysterical hysteria being
connected to hysterectomy the,

1769
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:39,700
and you had to define me.

1770
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:41,320
That's signed a way to
log it into the book.

1771
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:42,540
That's medical book.

1772
00:54:42,541 --> 00:54:42,691
Yeah.

1773
00:54:42,691 --> 00:54:45,990
It's like the connection hysteria
and hysterectomy like that.

1774
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:48,570
That's where the word comes from wildly.

1775
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:49,770
And these women,

1776
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:53,190
I mean I'm doing a butcher
job of the definition of it,

1777
00:54:53,191 --> 00:54:56,410
but these women would go to the
doctor and the doctor would,

1778
00:54:56,411 --> 00:54:57,244
uh,

1779
00:54:57,270 --> 00:54:58,210
just finger blast though.

1780
00:54:58,620 --> 00:54:59,770
That's the doctor would tell,

1781
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:00,870
you know,

1782
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:04,200
I mean with a cigarette in his mouth and
then the origins of the word hysteria.

1783
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:04,561
Yeah,

1784
00:55:04,561 --> 00:55:04,890
right.

1785
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:05,830
Probably right.

1786
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:08,101
Yeah.

1787
00:55:08,101 --> 00:55:08,610
It's,

1788
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:08,940
it's,

1789
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:13,350
it's wild how much things can
change in a short period of time.

1790
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:14,160
Yeah.

1791
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:14,850
And it's an,

1792
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:16,530
it's an accelerating thing as well.

1793
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:17,370
Uh,

1794
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:18,350
but I think we're,

1795
00:55:18,430 --> 00:55:18,630
you know,

1796
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:20,640
we'll look back on this time and say,

1797
00:55:20,641 --> 00:55:25,020
I can't believe we did that the same way
we're looking back on 40 years ago or

1798
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:26,070
30 years ago and saying,

1799
00:55:26,071 --> 00:55:26,430
I can't,

1800
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:27,600
I can't believe we did that.

1801
00:55:27,601 --> 00:55:28,434
So,

1802
00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:28,830
uh,

1803
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:31,170
there's definitely a movement
into the direction of,

1804
00:55:31,171 --> 00:55:31,830
uh,

1805
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:36,270
getting back to the food thing into a
direction of a more fulfilling diet.

1806
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:36,840
Yeah.

1807
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:37,561
Hysteria.

1808
00:55:37,561 --> 00:55:42,270
The describes unmanageable
emotional excess.

1809
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:46,590
The fear that can be centered on a body
part or most commonly on an imagined

1810
00:55:46,591 --> 00:55:48,720
problem with that body part.

1811
00:55:48,721 --> 00:55:50,640
Disease is a common complaint.

1812
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:51,420
Uh,

1813
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:55,500
see also body dysmorphic disorder
and heal what I was reading or,

1814
00:55:55,501 --> 00:55:55,621
no,

1815
00:55:55,621 --> 00:55:55,891
sorry,

1816
00:55:55,891 --> 00:55:57,270
listening to a podcast,

1817
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:58,051
uh,

1818
00:55:58,051 --> 00:55:59,940
I think it was radio lab or I dunno,

1819
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:01,110
something like that.

1820
00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:06,110
And they were talking about using a
woman using a pms as a defense in a court

1821
00:56:07,021 --> 00:56:07,854
case.

1822
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:08,670
Oh yeah.

1823
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:09,031
For,

1824
00:56:09,031 --> 00:56:09,864
uh,

1825
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,880
for punching or hitting
her kid or something,

1826
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:12,783
something like that.

1827
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,100
And,

1828
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:17,850
and how the implications of
that on the legal system,

1829
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:18,743
whether or not,

1830
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,113
uh,

1831
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:24,160
whether or not you're psychologically
there when you're experiencing that

1832
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,830
hormonal imbalance that comes
with that time of the month.

1833
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:27,491
Yeah.

1834
00:56:27,491 --> 00:56:30,580
Well people have used sugar
as defense for murder.

1835
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,200
Like yeah.

1836
00:56:32,201 --> 00:56:36,570
Some guy use Twinkies eating Kate
to make Twinkies and went crazy.

1837
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:38,050
I believe that was in northern California.

1838
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:38,651
Yeah,

1839
00:56:38,651 --> 00:56:39,730
female hysteria.

1840
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:40,810
That's the the thing.

1841
00:56:40,811 --> 00:56:45,400
I was looking for a once common
medical diagnosis exclusively in women,

1842
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:49,240
which today no longer recognized by
medical authorities as a medical disorder.

1843
00:56:49,241 --> 00:56:54,241
It's diagnosis and treatment where routine
for many hundreds of years in western

1844
00:56:54,401 --> 00:56:56,140
Europe and one of the
things they would do,

1845
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:59,290
they would blast water on a woman's pussy.

1846
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:00,670
There's,

1847
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:01,690
there's a photo,

1848
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:04,070
if you go to the Wikipedia for the,

1849
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:07,450
look at that cannon fire hose,

1850
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:12,700
there's blast and note how her
legs are together and down.

1851
00:57:12,701 --> 00:57:15,910
Meanwhile she'd be like grabbing the
back of her knees yet outta here.

1852
00:57:15,911 --> 00:57:16,930
It would just be flooding.

1853
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:20,380
Look at that wedding chair that doesn't
look like it's ready for that kind of

1854
00:57:20,381 --> 00:57:21,040
force.

1855
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:25,060
I know it should be like some sort of a
captain's chair like a captain Kirk had

1856
00:57:25,061 --> 00:57:28,030
in the enterprise that's going
to tip over and they will like.

1857
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:33,040
You see how the doctors keeping his
distance ways he's firing that from a fair

1858
00:57:33,041 --> 00:57:33,501
distance.

1859
00:57:33,501 --> 00:57:38,050
The physician in 1859 claimed at a
quarter of all women suffer from hysteria.

1860
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:43,470
One physician cataloged 75
pages of possible symptoms
of hysteria and called the

1861
00:57:44,141 --> 00:57:45,550
list incomplete.

1862
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:48,700
Almost any Aleman could fit the diagnosis.

1863
00:57:48,850 --> 00:57:53,110
Physicians thought that the stresses
associated with modern life cause civilize

1864
00:57:53,111 --> 00:57:58,111
women to be both more susceptible to
nervous disorders and to FAU to develop

1865
00:57:58,870 --> 00:58:00,850
faulty reproductive tracks.

1866
00:58:01,330 --> 00:58:04,230
What they just fucking gas back then.

1867
00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:09,670
It's really amazing when you go back
just you know a couple hundred years and

1868
00:58:09,671 --> 00:58:14,620
you look at like the connections
they had to disorders and diseases.

1869
00:58:14,621 --> 00:58:17,020
They just guessed they were so off.

1870
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:17,710
Yeah,

1871
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:19,660
they didn't know what the
fuck they were talking about.

1872
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:21,191
It's false.

1873
00:58:21,191 --> 00:58:22,024
It's not true.

1874
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:23,770
Oh is that Snopes?

1875
00:58:25,270 --> 00:58:28,990
But didn't some guy actually use
something like sugar as a defense?

1876
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:29,890
Sugar as a defense.

1877
00:58:29,891 --> 00:58:32,980
I'm sure some hot shot
lawyer has attempted to use.

1878
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:34,901
What does he say?

1879
00:58:34,901 --> 00:58:35,441
Anything to say?

1880
00:58:35,441 --> 00:58:36,310
It never happened.

1881
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:37,350
Uh,

1882
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:38,670
recently resigned.

1883
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:39,683
Uh,

1884
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:43,450
tweak your defenses over common.

1885
00:58:43,451 --> 00:58:44,640
They recognized term.

1886
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:49,500
It says he got off with
voluntary manslaughter.

1887
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:54,150
Defense argued the refined sugar and
is junk food made them depressed it

1888
00:58:54,151 --> 00:58:56,700
mentally incapable of premeditated murder.

1889
00:58:57,070 --> 00:58:57,161
Well,

1890
00:58:57,161 --> 00:58:57,311
no,

1891
00:58:57,311 --> 00:58:57,521
this,

1892
00:58:57,521 --> 00:58:57,821
listen,

1893
00:58:57,821 --> 00:59:02,440
this was an actual defense and he tried
to use his defense was that he suffered

1894
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:05,230
diminished capacity as
a result of depression.

1895
00:59:05,490 --> 00:59:09,520
His change in die from healthy food to
Twinkies and other sugary food was said

1896
00:59:09,521 --> 00:59:10,990
to be a symptom of depression.

1897
00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:13,990
So contrary to popular belief,

1898
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:17,890
his attorneys did not argue that
Twinkies were the cause of the actions,

1899
00:59:17,891 --> 00:59:22,070
but at the consumption was symptomatic
of an underlying depression.

1900
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:23,570
So it was like confusing.

1901
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:24,800
So like he's deep,

1902
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:25,581
he's depressed.

1903
00:59:25,581 --> 00:59:25,791
Look,

1904
00:59:25,791 --> 00:59:26,650
heats all these 20,

1905
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:27,830
you must be depressed,

1906
00:59:27,831 --> 00:59:28,341
depressed,

1907
00:59:28,341 --> 00:59:29,530
and that's why he killed somebody.

1908
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:33,510
It wasn't that the Twinkies were
causing him to kill some money.

1909
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:34,401
The Twinkies,

1910
00:59:34,401 --> 00:59:36,020
we're just a consequence
of his depression.

1911
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:36,441
Twinkies.

1912
00:59:36,441 --> 00:59:39,320
Apparently we were never mentioned
the courtroom during the trial,

1913
00:59:39,430 --> 00:59:43,100
nor the defense ever claim that white
was on a sugar rush and committed the

1914
00:59:43,101 --> 00:59:44,180
murders as a result,

1915
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:45,330
however one report,

1916
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:47,960
his use of the term twinkie
defense caught on and stuck.

1917
00:59:48,170 --> 00:59:50,150
That's people in a nutshell and that's me.

1918
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:51,140
I'm perpetrating it.

1919
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:55,070
Fucking keeping the
ignorant chain rolling.

1920
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:56,990
It's funny how stuff like that works,

1921
00:59:56,991 --> 00:59:57,230
you know?

1922
00:59:57,230 --> 01:00:01,040
I mean essentially a lot of
that is going on in Ferguson.

1923
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:03,920
Like someone gets an idea and
then like my hands are up,

1924
01:00:03,921 --> 01:00:04,521
don't shoot.

1925
01:00:04,521 --> 01:00:06,530
Like they're pretending that
this kid said my hands are up.

1926
01:00:06,531 --> 01:00:07,180
Don't shoot.

1927
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:08,690
It's like people keep saying hands up,

1928
01:00:08,691 --> 01:00:09,291
don't shoot,

1929
01:00:09,291 --> 01:00:09,831
hands up,

1930
01:00:09,831 --> 01:00:10,664
don't shoot.

1931
01:00:10,970 --> 01:00:12,260
And then it's a better story.

1932
01:00:12,261 --> 01:00:15,520
Witnesses that made testimony,

1933
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:20,620
the indictment there were saying that
he rushed the cop and then he said,

1934
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:22,430
you know you too much
of a pussy to shoot me.

1935
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,800
Who the fuck knows what really happened?

1936
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:25,620
It's just,

1937
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:26,990
that's not the sexy story.

1938
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:27,830
Exactly.

1939
01:00:27,830 --> 01:00:30,110
Cops need to wear fucking cameras,

1940
01:00:30,350 --> 01:00:30,890
you know?

1941
01:00:30,890 --> 01:00:33,470
And a couple cops have argued
with me about this online.

1942
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:34,071
Really?

1943
01:00:34,071 --> 01:00:34,311
Yeah,

1944
01:00:34,311 --> 01:00:34,531
yeah,

1945
01:00:34,531 --> 01:00:34,880
yeah.

1946
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,530
Saying that they don't think they should.

1947
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:36,741
Yeah.

1948
01:00:36,741 --> 01:00:37,461
They were saying like,

1949
01:00:37,461 --> 01:00:37,701
you know,

1950
01:00:37,701 --> 01:00:40,550
do you have much more to
go with calls but fuck off.

1951
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:42,800
How much is it go pro fuck off.

1952
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:44,230
You can get one for 150 bucks.

1953
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:45,380
Jesus Christ,

1954
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:50,210
you got fucking so much money is
being a four K GoPro right now.

1955
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:53,750
So much money's being
invested in the war on drugs.

1956
01:00:53,751 --> 01:00:55,910
So much money's being
invested in Afghanistan.

1957
01:00:55,911 --> 01:00:58,190
I rack and just feeling
the fucking blanks.

1958
01:00:58,490 --> 01:00:59,720
Corn subsidies,

1959
01:00:59,721 --> 01:01:00,554
I mean Jesus Christ,

1960
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:02,500
the amount of money that's being,

1961
01:01:02,501 --> 01:01:03,620
do you ever watch king corn?

1962
01:01:03,710 --> 01:01:06,470
The amount of money that's being invested
in making sure that Mcdonald's still

1963
01:01:06,471 --> 01:01:07,550
has fucking corn syrup.

1964
01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:10,100
There's a lot of money going around folks.

1965
01:01:10,110 --> 01:01:13,670
And the idea that someone
who carries a fucking gun,

1966
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:16,790
that it's not a good idea
to put a camera on them.

1967
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:17,510
Right?

1968
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:18,460
For all sorts of reasons.

1969
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:18,740
Look,

1970
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:21,530
if that kid was saying on camera,

1971
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:25,070
you're too much of a pussy to shoot me
and Juan and towards that cop and the cop

1972
01:01:25,071 --> 01:01:25,904
shot him,

1973
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:27,043
we're good.

1974
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:27,800
We're done.

1975
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:28,640
This whole thing is done.

1976
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:32,030
So right now we're dealing with a lot
of speculation and we have a bunch of

1977
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:36,160
people that are walking down the
street and mass closing down freeways.

1978
01:01:36,161 --> 01:01:37,010
Say yelling out,

1979
01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:37,910
hands up,

1980
01:01:37,911 --> 01:01:38,661
don't shoot.

1981
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:39,780
What's the cost of that now?

1982
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,450
How the fuck do we even know that?

1983
01:01:41,451 --> 01:01:42,320
That was sad,

1984
01:01:42,470 --> 01:01:43,580
like what are you doing?

1985
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:47,750
And like that black guy that are on
Twitter was saying to the white rapper,

1986
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:51,410
you are blind to the facts
in your attempt to be down.

1987
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:53,630
And there's a lot of that going on.

1988
01:01:53,631 --> 01:01:55,010
There's a lot of track people.

1989
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:56,300
They want the narrative,

1990
01:01:56,330 --> 01:01:57,560
they want the narrative,

1991
01:01:57,890 --> 01:02:01,100
they want it to fit in with
their idea of you know,

1992
01:02:01,101 --> 01:02:01,520
what,

1993
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:05,870
what is just or what is exciting
or what's really going on.

1994
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:09,260
The other thing about the camera too is
it's not just about what would have been

1995
01:02:09,261 --> 01:02:09,980
captured,

1996
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:11,750
it's about what might not have happened.

1997
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:11,961
Well,

1998
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:15,740
there's a I p I tweeted a story or a
tweeted a study rather about California

1999
01:02:15,890 --> 01:02:20,700
that said that when they made cops
where cameras that numbers of complaints

2000
01:02:20,701 --> 01:02:21,534
against cops,

2001
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:23,660
the numbers of violent incidents and,

2002
01:02:23,690 --> 01:02:24,210
and,

2003
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:27,150
and abuse dropped dramatically.

2004
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:29,070
When people are accountable,

2005
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:31,570
they don't fuck up on both sides.

2006
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:32,850
Both sides on both sides.

2007
01:02:32,851 --> 01:02:33,420
If you are,

2008
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:37,260
if you're somebody who's committing
a crime or not or whatever,

2009
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:39,570
you understand the
consequences of that camera.

2010
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:39,930
Yes.

2011
01:02:39,930 --> 01:02:41,580
That what you're about to say and do.

2012
01:02:41,610 --> 01:02:45,150
There's a record of it and the cop
knows he can't get away with anything.

2013
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:45,721
Both parties.

2014
01:02:45,721 --> 01:02:48,300
Now you know what they should do if
they find a cop tampered would fucking

2015
01:02:48,301 --> 01:02:48,601
camera,

2016
01:02:48,601 --> 01:02:53,601
they should put him in jail for 20 years
and find a cod or erased footage or

2017
01:02:53,911 --> 01:02:54,601
that purposely,

2018
01:02:54,601 --> 01:02:56,940
if they can prove that a cop
purposely fuck with a camera,

2019
01:02:57,150 --> 01:02:59,150
there should be a high consequence.

2020
01:02:59,160 --> 01:02:59,993
Know what though?

2021
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:02,400
There's a way around
that you could have it,

2022
01:03:02,490 --> 01:03:02,730
uh,

2023
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:04,770
uploading streaming in real time.

2024
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:05,250
Yeah.

2025
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:05,610
You know,

2026
01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:05,880
like,

2027
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:06,480
have you heard it?

2028
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,700
Do you have one of those drop
cams or have you heard of them?

2029
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:09,511
You got to have heard of them.

2030
01:03:09,511 --> 01:03:10,050
Yeah.

2031
01:03:10,050 --> 01:03:12,130
So like set them up in five minutes.

2032
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:13,380
They're like this big,

2033
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:15,600
they connect to the wifi
network and then boom,

2034
01:03:15,601 --> 01:03:15,870
you're,

2035
01:03:15,870 --> 01:03:18,480
you're streaming probably would be if
you were in a place that was remote,

2036
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:18,961
you know,

2037
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:20,970
if you were in the Maine
Woods or something like that,

2038
01:03:20,971 --> 01:03:23,430
if you know ry fucking
game warden or something,

2039
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:26,130
abusive cops could get away
with it if there was no signal,

2040
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:27,350
but right.

2041
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:31,170
I mean if you had some sort of
a fail safe mechanism where the,

2042
01:03:31,171 --> 01:03:33,750
the data is being backed
up by a Bluetooth,

2043
01:03:33,990 --> 01:03:34,261
you know,

2044
01:03:34,261 --> 01:03:36,120
to the hard drive of the patrol car,

2045
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:36,810
you know,

2046
01:03:36,810 --> 01:03:40,440
or some sort of a signal that reaches
the hard drive of the patrol car and it

2047
01:03:40,441 --> 01:03:41,400
can't be tampered with.

2048
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:41,660
Right.

2049
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:44,100
That doesn't seem to me to be
outside of the realm of possibility.

2050
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:46,080
That would be great for everybody.

2051
01:03:46,081 --> 01:03:49,140
Great for the cops and
fantastic for civilians.

2052
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:49,681
I mean,

2053
01:03:49,681 --> 01:03:49,880
I,

2054
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:54,880
I guarantee you that alone would cut
back on police abuse dramatically.

2055
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:55,980
Would you per,

2056
01:03:55,980 --> 01:04:00,980
so you get pulled over for speeding,

2057
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:02,453
right.

2058
01:04:02,670 --> 01:04:04,380
You want the cop coming
up in recording that?

2059
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:05,160
Yes.

2060
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:05,580
Really?

2061
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:06,120
Sure.

2062
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:06,953
Okay.

2063
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:07,710
Why not?

2064
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:08,543
I don't know.

2065
01:04:08,610 --> 01:04:09,180
Some,

2066
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:10,260
there is some kind,

2067
01:04:10,290 --> 01:04:11,123
there is a,

2068
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:12,383
uh,

2069
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:16,050
a feeling that being recording
recorded as a negative thing,

2070
01:04:16,051 --> 01:04:16,884
like the whole,

2071
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:17,491
you know,

2072
01:04:17,491 --> 01:04:18,480
NSA type thing.

2073
01:04:18,481 --> 01:04:21,390
But maybe it's different because
you know you're being recorded.

2074
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:22,021
Yeah.

2075
01:04:22,021 --> 01:04:22,351
You know,

2076
01:04:22,351 --> 01:04:26,130
you're being recorded and you being
recorded because you violated a law.

2077
01:04:26,310 --> 01:04:26,581
Okay.

2078
01:04:26,581 --> 01:04:28,590
Let's say you didn't go well then you say,

2079
01:04:28,591 --> 01:04:29,730
I didn't violate the law,

2080
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:29,881
right?

2081
01:04:29,881 --> 01:04:31,350
Whatever you say it on camera.

2082
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:31,680
Right.

2083
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:33,660
So some people would have a
hard time asserting themselves,

2084
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:36,630
which would be an issue cause socially
some people a bit more awkward.

2085
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:37,980
That can be an issue.

2086
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:43,520
But I think that if someone comes up to
you and talks to you about a crime and

2087
01:04:44,431 --> 01:04:45,720
you know you're being recorded,

2088
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:48,420
I mean it's gotta be a
lot of transparency there.

2089
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:53,820
Like if you were speeding and they have
the evidence and they have all the data,

2090
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:57,840
I mean that's all the only thing that
would be a problem as people wouldn't be

2091
01:04:57,841 --> 01:05:02,841
able to get off for being cute or having
a crying story or a girl with big tits.

2092
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:04,381
Yeah.

2093
01:05:04,381 --> 01:05:09,381
Well and what percentage of traffic
infractions you do actually end up getting

2094
01:05:10,381 --> 01:05:11,640
convicted for the whole,

2095
01:05:11,730 --> 01:05:12,421
the whole thing.

2096
01:05:12,421 --> 01:05:14,220
Like there's no leniency there.

2097
01:05:14,550 --> 01:05:17,980
And the amount of blow jobs at
college receive would dramatically,

2098
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:19,030
that's the real reason,

2099
01:05:19,130 --> 01:05:19,963
right?

2100
01:05:20,110 --> 01:05:20,801
I know a cop,

2101
01:05:20,801 --> 01:05:22,030
well I don't know a cop rather,

2102
01:05:22,031 --> 01:05:24,910
I know a girl who got pulled
over by a cop and the cop said,

2103
01:05:24,911 --> 01:05:25,081
look,

2104
01:05:25,081 --> 01:05:26,950
it might be some other way
we can take care of this.

2105
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:27,731
And she was like,

2106
01:05:27,731 --> 01:05:29,370
what the fuck are you talking about?

2107
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:30,490
The cop went back to his car,

2108
01:05:30,491 --> 01:05:32,460
wrote her a ticket and
fucking centered on her way.

2109
01:05:33,150 --> 01:05:33,491
You know,

2110
01:05:33,491 --> 01:05:36,850
like he was been going on for
as long as it's been cops.

2111
01:05:36,851 --> 01:05:38,980
I'm sure he's floating it out there.

2112
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:40,391
Oh look,

2113
01:05:40,391 --> 01:05:41,530
my zippers on done.

2114
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:42,041
Oh,

2115
01:05:42,041 --> 01:05:43,060
your mouth is right there.

2116
01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:44,770
Yeah,

2117
01:05:44,770 --> 01:05:45,850
I mean it's been done.

2118
01:05:46,030 --> 01:05:47,050
It's not like the first,

2119
01:05:47,051 --> 01:05:47,201
I mean,

2120
01:05:47,201 --> 01:05:49,210
how many times it has a girl offered.

2121
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:49,901
He's probably,

2122
01:05:49,901 --> 01:05:51,280
a lot of girls are offered that.

2123
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:52,653
I don't know.

2124
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:53,553
I'm sure.

2125
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:53,860
You know.

2126
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:54,970
The thing is though,

2127
01:05:55,330 --> 01:05:56,740
human beings cameras.

2128
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:00,730
Why I was watching this
thing the other night,

2129
01:06:00,850 --> 01:06:01,683
um,

2130
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:04,180
and maybe you've heard of
it called surveillance man.

2131
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:05,030
No,

2132
01:06:05,030 --> 01:06:05,863
you heard of this.

2133
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:08,660
He recently got all these
shit pulled off youtube.

2134
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:09,790
Uh,

2135
01:06:09,790 --> 01:06:13,930
but this guy goes around
and just records people.

2136
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:16,330
Regular people walks up to you,

2137
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:18,430
records you and puts it online and,

2138
01:06:18,550 --> 01:06:19,241
and whatever.

2139
01:06:19,241 --> 01:06:21,130
He edits it together
and puts it on Youtube.

2140
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:22,390
Well that's Kinda fucked up.

2141
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:23,830
Take this very fucked up.

2142
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:25,040
That's it's,

2143
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:26,050
it's very fucked up.

2144
01:06:26,051 --> 01:06:26,884
Is he a creep?

2145
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:28,411
I wouldn't know who.

2146
01:06:28,411 --> 01:06:29,340
We know who the guy is.

2147
01:06:29,590 --> 01:06:30,400
No idea.

2148
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,200
So he doesn't put himself on that ever.

2149
01:06:32,290 --> 01:06:33,090
Fuck that guy.

2150
01:06:33,090 --> 01:06:34,790
So he walks up to people and gets,

2151
01:06:35,330 --> 01:06:35,800
uh,

2152
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:37,270
various responses.

2153
01:06:37,271 --> 01:06:37,931
Some people,

2154
01:06:37,931 --> 01:06:39,010
like he walks up to chew,

2155
01:06:39,510 --> 01:06:40,900
all this stuff got pulled off youtube,

2156
01:06:40,901 --> 01:06:42,640
but it's on live leak now.

2157
01:06:42,910 --> 01:06:45,130
He walks up to two Mormons,

2158
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:49,450
the ones that go door to door
and they're super polite.

2159
01:06:49,510 --> 01:06:49,871
They're like,

2160
01:06:49,871 --> 01:06:50,620
whoa.

2161
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:50,920
They're like,

2162
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:51,131
oh,

2163
01:06:51,131 --> 01:06:51,741
you're recording.

2164
01:06:51,741 --> 01:06:52,271
And it's whatever.

2165
01:06:52,271 --> 01:06:54,790
Like they have a nice
conversation and they walk off.

2166
01:06:55,090 --> 01:06:55,930
But then other people,

2167
01:06:55,931 --> 01:06:56,980
they're trying to knock them out.

2168
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:58,600
But I think it's so,

2169
01:06:58,630 --> 01:07:03,630
it's so interesting how the camera in
and of itself almost has this social view

2170
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:06,190
of,

2171
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:07,030
of like,

2172
01:07:07,031 --> 01:07:08,320
like a weapon in a way.

2173
01:07:08,610 --> 01:07:13,610
It's like you're pointing that thing at
me because you're attempting to take,

2174
01:07:13,811 --> 01:07:16,750
the person's not doing anything
wrong by pointing the thing.

2175
01:07:16,751 --> 01:07:16,871
No,

2176
01:07:16,871 --> 01:07:17,080
no,

2177
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:17,201
no.

2178
01:07:17,201 --> 01:07:19,180
I mean the person that's getting recorded,

2179
01:07:19,330 --> 01:07:20,800
you're not doing anything wrong.

2180
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:23,560
Why does it make us feel so uncomfortable?

2181
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:27,160
You're opening up a door for a bunch of
other people to enter into your life.

2182
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:29,350
If you take a guy like
I take a camera on you.

2183
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:29,800
Yeah,

2184
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:30,491
I don't know you,

2185
01:07:30,491 --> 01:07:31,180
I find you,

2186
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:32,290
I take a camera and you know,

2187
01:07:32,291 --> 01:07:35,170
and I put it on a youtube channel that
has a million subscribers like yours.

2188
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:36,170
Does he,

2189
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:39,340
let's say the person doesn't know
that when they're being recorded.

2190
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:40,250
Okay.

2191
01:07:40,250 --> 01:07:40,510
Dot.

2192
01:07:40,510 --> 01:07:40,691
Right?

2193
01:07:40,691 --> 01:07:41,860
Like if you're out in the street,

2194
01:07:42,310 --> 01:07:45,100
probably doesn't count for you because
somebody might know who you are and what

2195
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:45,731
in that case.

2196
01:07:45,731 --> 01:07:49,480
But if you're a regular everyday person
and someone walks up to you with their

2197
01:07:49,510 --> 01:07:52,060
smartphone and they're just
a few feet away from you,

2198
01:07:52,061 --> 01:07:55,300
recording you that like
that's what he's doing.

2199
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:57,760
He's not announcing that
it's going to be on youtube,

2200
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,100
but people's reactions are intense.

2201
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:00,740
Yeah.

2202
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:02,140
Shouldn't be into his phone.

2203
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:03,730
It's still is fun.

2204
01:08:03,730 --> 01:08:04,563
Kick him in the Dick.

2205
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:05,371
Fuck that.

2206
01:08:05,371 --> 01:08:06,250
But maybe he wins.

2207
01:08:06,710 --> 01:08:07,810
He wins that way.

2208
01:08:07,870 --> 01:08:08,980
He wins the how's he win?

2209
01:08:09,010 --> 01:08:09,910
Cause I stole his phone.

2210
01:08:09,970 --> 01:08:10,181
No,

2211
01:08:10,181 --> 01:08:11,014
because that's a way,

2212
01:08:11,330 --> 01:08:13,480
because that's a way better
clip if you don't get it,

2213
01:08:13,870 --> 01:08:15,260
if you don't get that phone,

2214
01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:15,531
oh,

2215
01:08:15,531 --> 01:08:16,364
I'll get his phone.

2216
01:08:17,850 --> 01:08:18,860
Let me get his phone.

2217
01:08:18,890 --> 01:08:19,161
Well,

2218
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:19,790
whatever you may,

2219
01:08:19,790 --> 01:08:23,870
you may be more gifted than others who
fail in his clips to get it from him.

2220
01:08:24,190 --> 01:08:25,940
Is he like a sprinter while he's,

2221
01:08:25,941 --> 01:08:26,171
he,

2222
01:08:26,171 --> 01:08:27,080
he starts to get what he,

2223
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:28,610
he moves away at the right time.

2224
01:08:28,611 --> 01:08:29,391
This guy's crazy.

2225
01:08:29,391 --> 01:08:31,190
He interrupts like,

2226
01:08:31,191 --> 01:08:31,990
uh,

2227
01:08:31,990 --> 01:08:32,400
he,

2228
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:32,990
he,

2229
01:08:32,990 --> 01:08:36,470
there are cases where he walks behind the
cash register at Mcdonald's and starts

2230
01:08:36,471 --> 01:08:40,280
recording people that are like
making burgers and they're just like,

2231
01:08:40,281 --> 01:08:41,114
what the fuck?

2232
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:44,330
Or in certain cases it's
like he know he walks,

2233
01:08:44,810 --> 01:08:47,380
he walks into like a um,

2234
01:08:47,780 --> 01:08:50,630
a card game that's going on private
card game and he's recording it.

2235
01:08:50,631 --> 01:08:52,400
Like he takes risks to,

2236
01:08:52,430 --> 01:08:53,360
to get that footage.

2237
01:08:53,361 --> 01:08:55,280
But I agree with you,

2238
01:08:55,281 --> 01:08:56,180
fuck that guy.

2239
01:08:56,480 --> 01:09:01,480
But at the same time I think it sort of
unveils something about humanity and how

2240
01:09:01,910 --> 01:09:04,790
we're not completely ready
for a fully recorded future.

2241
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,020
We're not completely ready,

2242
01:09:06,021 --> 01:09:07,670
but I feel like it's kind of inevitable.

2243
01:09:07,730 --> 01:09:10,670
I think there's almost
nothing to stop it from.

2244
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:12,530
I mean if you look at
where things are going,

2245
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:16,880
you look at what was our access to
information just a hundred years ago.

2246
01:09:17,150 --> 01:09:17,630
What is,

2247
01:09:17,630 --> 01:09:20,510
what is our access to information going
to be like a hundred years from now,

2248
01:09:20,570 --> 01:09:22,620
fully streaming everything
fully streaming.

2249
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:23,630
Now I'm,

2250
01:09:23,631 --> 01:09:28,631
I'm a big believer in that we're going
to be sharing our lives that our lives

2251
01:09:28,650 --> 01:09:29,360
going to be like,

2252
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:29,541
like,

2253
01:09:29,541 --> 01:09:29,721
you know,

2254
01:09:29,721 --> 01:09:32,630
I can go to your Facebook and look at
your pictures and I think there's going to

2255
01:09:32,631 --> 01:09:35,900
be a time where you're going to be able
to read my fucking thoughts because my

2256
01:09:35,901 --> 01:09:40,880
thoughts are going to be recorded on a
hard drive and HD or my instead of my

2257
01:09:40,881 --> 01:09:41,181
thoughts,

2258
01:09:41,181 --> 01:09:41,960
whether my life,

2259
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:42,793
what I see,

2260
01:09:43,010 --> 01:09:43,311
you know,

2261
01:09:43,311 --> 01:09:44,750
the experiences that I have.

2262
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:49,130
And then from there it's probably going
to be even more complex and complicated.

2263
01:09:49,130 --> 01:09:53,750
There's going to be some
sort of a mechanism for a
re-introducing emotions into

2264
01:09:53,751 --> 01:09:54,830
an outside observer.

2265
01:09:54,950 --> 01:09:58,250
Like I could find out whether or not
you cried when you went to the movies.

2266
01:09:58,370 --> 01:10:00,110
I'll watch a movie
through your perspective.

2267
01:10:00,111 --> 01:10:00,261
I mean,

2268
01:10:00,261 --> 01:10:02,300
that might be a channel that you go to.

2269
01:10:02,301 --> 01:10:03,660
Let's watch movies with Louis.

2270
01:10:03,661 --> 01:10:04,000
Yes.

2271
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:04,280
You know,

2272
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:04,521
and like,

2273
01:10:04,521 --> 01:10:04,941
Oh my God,

2274
01:10:04,941 --> 01:10:06,920
Avatar 16 just made me cry.

2275
01:10:07,310 --> 01:10:07,681
And I'm like,

2276
01:10:07,681 --> 01:10:07,851
oh,

2277
01:10:07,851 --> 01:10:09,190
he's crying like you were,

2278
01:10:09,370 --> 01:10:09,530
you know,

2279
01:10:09,530 --> 01:10:11,180
like you see it through your eyes.

2280
01:10:11,590 --> 01:10:14,510
I could like see what you like
to masturbate too and how,

2281
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:14,880
what,

2282
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:15,860
what excites you.

2283
01:10:15,890 --> 01:10:18,590
But that's all it totally inevitable.

2284
01:10:18,830 --> 01:10:21,500
But if you asked anybody to
flip that switch tomorrow,

2285
01:10:22,150 --> 01:10:24,260
it's like you're not going
to be on the front lines.

2286
01:10:24,710 --> 01:10:26,030
I don't know about all.

2287
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:26,271
Oh,

2288
01:10:26,271 --> 01:10:27,104
you would,

2289
01:10:27,350 --> 01:10:29,600
you're ready to broadcast 24 seven.

2290
01:10:29,650 --> 01:10:30,380
I don't,

2291
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:31,310
not me,

2292
01:10:31,370 --> 01:10:33,830
but I think a lot of
people would jump right?

2293
01:10:33,830 --> 01:10:34,520
The phone.

2294
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:36,740
You have people on Youtube
who almost do that.

2295
01:10:36,741 --> 01:10:38,570
They upload a Vlog every day.

2296
01:10:38,630 --> 01:10:39,463
Let's say.

2297
01:10:39,530 --> 01:10:41,420
I like how you said that Vlog Vlog.

2298
01:10:41,450 --> 01:10:42,560
I usually call it v log.

2299
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:42,900
Oh,

2300
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:43,310
okay.

2301
01:10:43,310 --> 01:10:44,000
Vlog.

2302
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:44,181
Well,

2303
01:10:44,181 --> 01:10:45,920
because it was pulled from blog.

2304
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:46,813
Right.

2305
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:48,080
But uh,

2306
01:10:48,530 --> 01:10:48,890
and I,

2307
01:10:48,890 --> 01:10:50,660
I sit there and I look
at that and I'm like,

2308
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:51,350
damn,

2309
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:54,200
I am so happy that that's not me.

2310
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,090
That's not what I have to do.

2311
01:10:56,180 --> 01:10:56,331
Well,

2312
01:10:56,331 --> 01:10:56,660
you,

2313
01:10:56,660 --> 01:10:58,250
you're a content based guy.

2314
01:10:58,251 --> 01:10:58,540
You're,

2315
01:10:58,540 --> 01:11:03,540
you're doing videos at unbox therapy
based on your review of particular items,

2316
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:05,470
objects,

2317
01:11:05,470 --> 01:11:06,303
things.

2318
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:06,621
Yeah.

2319
01:11:06,621 --> 01:11:08,030
So people are tuning in,

2320
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:09,080
not,

2321
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:11,000
I mean partially for a
glimpse into my life,

2322
01:11:11,001 --> 01:11:11,834
but not,

2323
01:11:12,110 --> 01:11:17,110
I'm not expected to create content
out of my experiences 24 seven right.

2324
01:11:17,610 --> 01:11:21,390
Whereas like I feel like a bloggers
in this and this kind of space,

2325
01:11:21,391 --> 01:11:22,141
not everybody,

2326
01:11:22,141 --> 01:11:25,080
but some where they're trying to turn,

2327
01:11:25,490 --> 01:11:27,300
I'm going to be not
even consciously trying,

2328
01:11:27,301 --> 01:11:29,640
but once you broadcast everything you do,

2329
01:11:29,641 --> 01:11:31,320
how can it not become a performance?

2330
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:33,300
How can it not be what you mean?

2331
01:11:33,301 --> 01:11:33,810
Yeah.

2332
01:11:33,810 --> 01:11:37,440
Well that was hunters Thompson a argument
when they were filming him way back

2333
01:11:37,441 --> 01:11:38,274
when he was doing

2334
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:41,820
one of his early documentaries
and they did on him.

2335
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:42,960
He was saying that you're,

2336
01:11:42,961 --> 01:11:43,231
you know,

2337
01:11:43,231 --> 01:11:44,340
you're not going to really get it.

2338
01:11:44,341 --> 01:11:49,341
Like that camera that you're putting on
me changes the interaction 100% exactly.

2339
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:51,780
And that's what I was trying
to get at with the whole,

2340
01:11:51,810 --> 01:11:56,580
the whole thing before about
the cop carrying the camera
or the surveillance guy

2341
01:11:56,610 --> 01:11:58,350
or whatever is like,

2342
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:00,930
are you you when a camera's on?

2343
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:01,980
Yeah.

2344
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:05,910
Well eventually you are potentially
your you when the camera's on,

2345
01:12:05,911 --> 01:12:06,630
what does that mean?

2346
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:09,000
I'm you now hear me now?

2347
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:10,073
No,

2348
01:12:10,180 --> 01:12:11,880
I'm mean now.

2349
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:13,590
You mean now when the camera's on?

2350
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:14,130
Are you?

2351
01:12:14,130 --> 01:12:14,963
Yes,

2352
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:17,010
like this camera on me as deep man.

2353
01:12:17,430 --> 01:12:18,060
But I do,

2354
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:19,590
I do this so often.

2355
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:20,740
I know in a podcast,

2356
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:22,920
like if you and I were
having this conversation,

2357
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:25,590
the only difference would be I wouldn't
be feeling these fucking things on my

2358
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:26,400
ears.

2359
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:26,890
Yeah.

2360
01:12:26,890 --> 01:12:27,723
I mean it may be,

2361
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:28,560
but here's a bigger,

2362
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:29,670
quite personal information.

2363
01:12:29,671 --> 01:12:30,750
Here's a bigger question.

2364
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:32,760
Are you the same?

2365
01:12:32,761 --> 01:12:33,750
Me Too.

2366
01:12:33,751 --> 01:12:38,751
Everybody not to people that I don't
know if they might have like ulterior

2367
01:12:39,511 --> 01:12:42,330
motives or they might be
creepers or there might be weird,

2368
01:12:42,331 --> 01:12:44,600
like there's people about certain things.

2369
01:12:44,710 --> 01:12:48,210
Sometimes you're sitting in that
chair and I'm sure I don't remember.

2370
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:49,650
One doesn't come to mind,

2371
01:12:49,651 --> 01:12:51,510
but the guy across from you,

2372
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:53,093
you're not.

2373
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:54,113
You know what I mean?

2374
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:56,040
There's not a connection.

2375
01:12:56,041 --> 01:12:57,330
Like it could be a,

2376
01:12:58,140 --> 01:12:58,973
I don't know if you,

2377
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:00,510
maybe not if you disagree with that,

2378
01:13:00,511 --> 01:13:05,511
but you must have had conflict before
in this environment changed the you that

2379
01:13:05,551 --> 01:13:06,930
you were most certainly me.

2380
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:08,220
But you also would have,

2381
01:13:08,221 --> 01:13:10,770
I mean any conflict outside
of this environment.

2382
01:13:11,070 --> 01:13:14,010
If you had conflict with someone and you
want to trademark it would change who

2383
01:13:14,011 --> 01:13:15,570
you were and how you interacted with them.

2384
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:17,010
You would be more guarded.

2385
01:13:17,011 --> 01:13:17,341
You'd be like,

2386
01:13:17,341 --> 01:13:17,461
Oh,

2387
01:13:17,461 --> 01:13:18,210
this guy's a creep.

2388
01:13:18,210 --> 01:13:19,043
Yeah.

2389
01:13:19,110 --> 01:13:19,650
Yeah.

2390
01:13:19,650 --> 01:13:20,740
See The you the,

2391
01:13:21,650 --> 01:13:23,130
this is like deep shit.

2392
01:13:23,131 --> 01:13:23,910
But like,

2393
01:13:23,910 --> 01:13:24,691
but no,

2394
01:13:24,691 --> 01:13:25,524
but seriously,

2395
01:13:25,950 --> 01:13:29,130
I don't know that you can be the
same person around everybody.

2396
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:30,360
Yeah.

2397
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:32,100
I think I know we all,

2398
01:13:32,101 --> 01:13:34,920
I think we all do some kind of editing.

2399
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:35,790
Right?

2400
01:13:35,790 --> 01:13:37,260
Well and not only that,

2401
01:13:37,261 --> 01:13:37,441
I mean,

2402
01:13:37,441 --> 01:13:40,380
isn't that kind of what
being a human being is?

2403
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:41,280
We are,

2404
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:46,280
part of what we are is we are who we
become when we're around other people.

2405
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:46,680
Yes.

2406
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:48,660
One of the reasons why we like
being around certain people,

2407
01:13:48,670 --> 01:13:49,890
they make us better.

2408
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:50,640
Yes.

2409
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:51,151
Interesting.

2410
01:13:51,151 --> 01:13:52,290
And it made me agree with that.

2411
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:57,440
They make you more fun or they make you
more kind or they make us where we're

2412
01:13:57,530 --> 01:13:59,580
not totally autonomous,

2413
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:00,593
we're just not.

2414
01:14:00,660 --> 01:14:00,960
No,

2415
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:01,320
not,

2416
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:03,840
we're not completely individuals.

2417
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:07,800
We are individuals interacting with under
individuals and those ingredients of

2418
01:14:07,801 --> 01:14:09,300
these other individuals provide,

2419
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:10,650
they change who we are.

2420
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:12,860
That's it's important not to
hang around with negative p.

2421
01:14:12,870 --> 01:14:13,540
Yes,

2422
01:14:13,540 --> 01:14:15,400
I had a friend who's a nice guy,

2423
01:14:15,401 --> 01:14:17,560
but fucking dude was like,

2424
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:18,190
he,

2425
01:14:18,190 --> 01:14:22,330
he always was involved
in drama and bullshit.

2426
01:14:22,331 --> 01:14:23,500
And when I was around him,

2427
01:14:23,890 --> 01:14:26,620
like I remember thinking
like this fucking guy,

2428
01:14:26,621 --> 01:14:29,080
like everything in his
life is always a mess.

2429
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:31,960
And when I'm around him I become a mess.

2430
01:14:32,250 --> 01:14:32,981
Like when I'm around him,

2431
01:14:32,981 --> 01:14:35,200
I'm arguing with him and
when I'm not around him,

2432
01:14:35,470 --> 01:14:38,230
everything is calm and his life remain.

2433
01:14:38,231 --> 01:14:38,581
Koi.

2434
01:14:38,581 --> 01:14:41,500
I stopped hanging around with them
really slick way back in the day,

2435
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:44,440
but I stopped hanging around with him
and his life just became more and more

2436
01:14:44,441 --> 01:14:45,340
chaotic in mind.

2437
01:14:45,340 --> 01:14:46,960
Became peaceful because of it,

2438
01:14:46,961 --> 01:14:49,450
because I eliminated this one,

2439
01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:52,960
like super problematic dude from my life.

2440
01:14:52,961 --> 01:14:56,470
But I have other people that I hang
around with them and it's always fun.

2441
01:14:56,710 --> 01:14:56,981
Yeah.

2442
01:14:56,981 --> 01:14:57,281
You know,

2443
01:14:57,281 --> 01:14:57,941
I hang around with them.

2444
01:14:57,941 --> 01:15:00,100
It's always laughs and joking.

2445
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:03,310
It's always a good time and you
feel better when you're around them.

2446
01:15:03,311 --> 01:15:04,660
You become a better person.

2447
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:06,430
I think we collectively,

2448
01:15:06,580 --> 01:15:08,290
at least sometimes for me,

2449
01:15:08,291 --> 01:15:12,190
like we underestimate the
importance of this stimulus.

2450
01:15:12,620 --> 01:15:13,453
Yeah.

2451
01:15:14,090 --> 01:15:15,520
The people that are around us,

2452
01:15:15,521 --> 01:15:17,140
the things that we
surround ourselves with.

2453
01:15:17,141 --> 01:15:19,690
Like Facebook recently did
something controversial.

2454
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:20,710
Um,

2455
01:15:20,710 --> 01:15:21,491
I don't know how recently,

2456
01:15:21,491 --> 01:15:26,491
but they started auto playing videos
as you scroll through and you know that

2457
01:15:26,831 --> 01:15:27,070
the,

2458
01:15:27,070 --> 01:15:29,320
some of the shit that's out
there you don't want to see.

2459
01:15:29,370 --> 01:15:29,560
Yeah.

2460
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:30,010
Right.

2461
01:15:30,010 --> 01:15:30,670
Yeah,

2462
01:15:30,670 --> 01:15:31,001
I know.

2463
01:15:31,001 --> 01:15:31,990
I definitely don't,

2464
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:33,550
I don't play sucks in general.

2465
01:15:33,580 --> 01:15:34,450
It sucks in general.

2466
01:15:34,450 --> 01:15:37,510
But I guess what I'm getting at more
with this one is it's like the Internet

2467
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:41,800
opens up this door to
see as much as you want,

2468
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:42,693
right.

2469
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:43,840
And to,

2470
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:46,180
to use your eyeballs.

2471
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:51,910
You get in a metaphorical sense as
like the vein to insert the drug.

2472
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:55,540
And so I don't,

2473
01:15:55,870 --> 01:16:00,870
I don't know that we are collectively
aware of the fucking heavy duty

2474
01:16:01,301 --> 01:16:02,290
consequences of that,

2475
01:16:03,370 --> 01:16:04,330
that the web,

2476
01:16:05,410 --> 01:16:07,270
the web giving us everything is,

2477
01:16:07,870 --> 01:16:09,340
that's the best thing about the web.

2478
01:16:09,341 --> 01:16:14,341
But it's also the worst thing about
the web in that you're changed forever.

2479
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:16,750
You watch a guy's head get chopped off,

2480
01:16:16,751 --> 01:16:17,584
you're different.

2481
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:18,970
It's true.

2482
01:16:18,970 --> 01:16:19,371
It's true.

2483
01:16:19,371 --> 01:16:19,720
There's no,

2484
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:20,590
there's no going back.

2485
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:21,611
You've seen it.

2486
01:16:21,611 --> 01:16:22,540
You know what that looks like.

2487
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:23,711
I mean,

2488
01:16:23,711 --> 01:16:26,590
up until I was in my twenties I didn't
know what it looked like when the guy got

2489
01:16:26,591 --> 01:16:28,330
his head sought off by a buck knife.

2490
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:29,260
You know it's right.

2491
01:16:29,430 --> 01:16:30,640
Then you see it and you go,

2492
01:16:30,641 --> 01:16:32,080
oh Jesus Christ.

2493
01:16:32,081 --> 01:16:35,680
And I remember I can still to this day
remember I think the first time I ever

2494
01:16:35,681 --> 01:16:37,210
saw like faces of death,

2495
01:16:37,540 --> 01:16:40,840
same and to this day I was
way too young to see that.

2496
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:41,291
Yeah,

2497
01:16:41,291 --> 01:16:45,040
I would just remember like the
weird like tightening of your body.

2498
01:16:45,041 --> 01:16:45,820
Like the,

2499
01:16:45,820 --> 01:16:47,410
the intent me ask you this.

2500
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:49,240
Do you wish that you hadn't seen it?

2501
01:16:49,660 --> 01:16:50,290
No.

2502
01:16:50,290 --> 01:16:50,471
No.

2503
01:16:50,471 --> 01:16:51,304
I'm fine now.

2504
01:16:51,610 --> 01:16:51,971
Well,

2505
01:16:51,971 --> 01:16:53,320
I mean I've seen them now.

2506
01:16:53,540 --> 01:16:55,240
It doesn't make me a worse person.

2507
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:57,280
Just it is what it is.

2508
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:58,750
I know what it is now.

2509
01:16:58,930 --> 01:16:59,320
No,

2510
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:01,210
it's like you don't go out of
your way to watch more of it.

2511
01:17:01,211 --> 01:17:01,690
No,

2512
01:17:01,690 --> 01:17:02,350
I do not.

2513
01:17:02,350 --> 01:17:03,420
I avoid it.

2514
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:09,500
These recent ones with these journalists
that would be headed by the isis guys.

2515
01:17:09,590 --> 01:17:10,470
I.

2516
01:17:10,470 --> 01:17:10,470
I.

2517
01:17:10,470 --> 01:17:12,890
W I avoided all of them because you need,

2518
01:17:12,950 --> 01:17:16,160
the objective of those guys
is to attract your eyeballs.

2519
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:18,200
I don't need to experience that.

2520
01:17:18,230 --> 01:17:19,220
I know what it looks like.

2521
01:17:19,221 --> 01:17:20,120
I know what's going on.

2522
01:17:20,150 --> 01:17:20,910
I don't need to express,

2523
01:17:20,910 --> 01:17:23,540
but I do know I did watch one cause
I couldn't believe it was on fucking

2524
01:17:23,541 --> 01:17:24,374
youtube.

2525
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:26,150
Somebody sent me a link to it on Twitter,

2526
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:27,410
something about isis and I was like,

2527
01:17:27,411 --> 01:17:27,920
what?

2528
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:29,510
So I clicked on it thinking,

2529
01:17:29,511 --> 01:17:30,380
this is a youtube link.

2530
01:17:30,381 --> 01:17:31,880
This is not going to be anything serious.

2531
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:35,420
It was a full on execution.

2532
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:37,550
Them cutting their heads off.

2533
01:17:37,730 --> 01:17:42,080
Both Youtube and Twitter are having
difficulty keeping it down because of the

2534
01:17:42,110 --> 01:17:44,810
speed at which it's being
replicated in re uploaded.

2535
01:17:45,470 --> 01:17:49,940
These guys from a social media perspective
are fairly educated that you hear the

2536
01:17:49,941 --> 01:17:50,481
guy's voice,

2537
01:17:50,481 --> 01:17:51,680
he's got an English accent.

2538
01:17:52,310 --> 01:17:55,370
It's like these are not
who we think they are.

2539
01:17:55,530 --> 01:17:56,270
Right?

2540
01:17:56,270 --> 01:17:56,571
Right.

2541
01:17:56,571 --> 01:18:00,650
We think of them as being an uneducated
savages are unaware who were living in

2542
01:18:00,651 --> 01:18:01,430
caves.

2543
01:18:01,430 --> 01:18:02,181
That's when that,

2544
01:18:02,181 --> 01:18:04,160
and that was the narrative for so long.

2545
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:04,820
Yeah,

2546
01:18:04,820 --> 01:18:05,900
that that's what that was about.

2547
01:18:05,901 --> 01:18:10,160
But it's interesting how people subtract
themselves from the overall equation

2548
01:18:10,370 --> 01:18:10,820
like,

2549
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:13,160
and by that I mean that by watching it,

2550
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:16,910
you're a perpetuating it sort of,

2551
01:18:16,911 --> 01:18:17,300
yeah.

2552
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:18,020
Being away.

2553
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:18,291
Yeah,

2554
01:18:18,291 --> 01:18:22,130
because the entire objective from an Roi,

2555
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:24,260
this sounds gross to say it this way,

2556
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:26,360
but from an Roi perspective,

2557
01:18:26,390 --> 01:18:27,223
Roi,

2558
01:18:27,290 --> 01:18:31,850
return on investment from a
return on investment perspective,

2559
01:18:32,090 --> 01:18:37,090
Isis has mad legs via one dude.

2560
01:18:37,550 --> 01:18:38,400
What's the cost?

2561
01:18:38,401 --> 01:18:39,260
The one dude,

2562
01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:40,423
right.

2563
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:45,460
That's the scary part is that the Internet
has allowed for the proliferation of

2564
01:18:46,521 --> 01:18:47,510
a piece of content,

2565
01:18:47,511 --> 01:18:48,380
an idea,

2566
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:53,270
something that all of us collectively
recognize as negative but can't keep our

2567
01:18:53,271 --> 01:18:54,410
fucking eyes off.

2568
01:18:54,890 --> 01:18:59,270
Whether it was something that someone
tweeted [inaudible] who's a part of Isis.

2569
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:04,660
We was talking about how everybody gets
crazy when one person's body part gets

2570
01:19:04,761 --> 01:19:05,594
removed.

2571
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:08,840
But meanwhile a hundred
people get blown to bits.

2572
01:19:08,870 --> 01:19:09,050
Yeah.

2573
01:19:09,050 --> 01:19:09,831
By a robot.

2574
01:19:09,831 --> 01:19:10,270
There you go.

2575
01:19:10,270 --> 01:19:11,090
No one says a word.

2576
01:19:11,090 --> 01:19:11,923
There you go.

2577
01:19:12,590 --> 01:19:13,580
It's hard to argue with that.

2578
01:19:13,940 --> 01:19:14,181
I mean,

2579
01:19:14,181 --> 01:19:15,410
I'm not supporting isis,

2580
01:19:15,411 --> 01:19:16,850
but it's hard to argue with that logic.

2581
01:19:16,851 --> 01:19:19,460
Like we have some weird
ways of looking at loss.

2582
01:19:19,850 --> 01:19:21,320
Somebody tweeted me the other day,

2583
01:19:21,770 --> 01:19:22,250
um,

2584
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:27,250
that there was an objective to kill 40
people and they wound up killing 1,417

2585
01:19:28,341 --> 01:19:31,580
people in their attempt
to kill these 40 people.

2586
01:19:31,910 --> 01:19:35,060
Like that's a lot of fucking
murder for no reason.

2587
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:38,330
I mean that those other
people that collateral damage,

2588
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:40,430
those people have families,

2589
01:19:40,431 --> 01:19:41,930
those people have lives.

2590
01:19:41,931 --> 01:19:43,370
Those people had friends,

2591
01:19:43,371 --> 01:19:44,930
those people had lovers.

2592
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:46,610
All on these were gone.

2593
01:19:46,630 --> 01:19:50,450
So long as those people on TV speak a
different language and wear a different

2594
01:19:50,451 --> 01:19:52,010
outfit and look different than us.

2595
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:54,570
Buya Bulia choose.

2596
01:19:54,930 --> 01:19:55,763
Let's do it.

2597
01:19:56,790 --> 01:19:57,280
Yeah.

2598
01:19:57,280 --> 01:20:00,230
And the all that is affecting
us all that's changing us.

2599
01:20:00,230 --> 01:20:02,480
Just like having negative
people in our life.

2600
01:20:02,780 --> 01:20:04,760
Just like communicating
with shitty people.

2601
01:20:04,761 --> 01:20:06,290
Just like being in a bad neighborhood,

2602
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:08,430
all that is your reality.

2603
01:20:08,431 --> 01:20:12,690
You are a combination of your reality
and your take on that reality.

2604
01:20:13,170 --> 01:20:18,170
This membrane here like is not nearly as
strong from a structural perspective as

2605
01:20:19,711 --> 01:20:20,880
we like to believe it is.

2606
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:21,811
Yeah,

2607
01:20:21,811 --> 01:20:22,381
no shit.

2608
01:20:22,381 --> 01:20:23,214
Right.

2609
01:20:23,370 --> 01:20:25,260
That's what I was saying with the,

2610
01:20:25,261 --> 01:20:26,710
with the fast food thing in,

2611
01:20:26,870 --> 01:20:27,630
in uh,

2612
01:20:27,630 --> 01:20:30,330
targeting black people in black
neighborhoods and kids and this and that.

2613
01:20:30,331 --> 01:20:31,950
It's like the informational world.

2614
01:20:31,951 --> 01:20:35,670
We just don't view it like
torpedoes or heroin or whatever,

2615
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:38,700
but the consequences are very similar.

2616
01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:40,530
Like when you let shit in,

2617
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:41,281
it changes you.

2618
01:20:41,281 --> 01:20:42,780
Like we both just said emotionally,

2619
01:20:42,781 --> 01:20:46,110
how is it you can watch this thing
that you know already happened,

2620
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:47,010
right?

2621
01:20:47,010 --> 01:20:49,650
Like how I can't change
what happened there.

2622
01:20:49,950 --> 01:20:50,250
Right.

2623
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:52,140
When when a guy gets his head chopped off,

2624
01:20:52,330 --> 01:20:54,930
there's literally nothing
that I can do about it.

2625
01:20:55,470 --> 01:20:57,660
So it might as well be
fiction at this point.

2626
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:00,090
It might as well be
Hollywood at this point,

2627
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:01,133
but it's not,

2628
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:04,920
I watch it and I know the difference
and I can't steer clear of it.

2629
01:21:04,921 --> 01:21:06,360
I can't escape that high.

2630
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:07,710
Yeah.

2631
01:21:07,710 --> 01:21:09,330
You can't escape that input.

2632
01:21:10,130 --> 01:21:10,380
I mean,

2633
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:13,620
we are essentially a product of our input.

2634
01:21:14,470 --> 01:21:15,090
Yes.

2635
01:21:15,090 --> 01:21:16,560
Our interactions,

2636
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:18,900
our input and how we,

2637
01:21:19,230 --> 01:21:20,430
how we process all of it.

2638
01:21:20,610 --> 01:21:20,970
That's,

2639
01:21:20,970 --> 01:21:21,571
that's what we are,

2640
01:21:21,571 --> 01:21:22,440
that's what makes a person,

2641
01:21:22,441 --> 01:21:23,130
a person.

2642
01:21:23,130 --> 01:21:27,840
That's why people that have lived color
for lives are so interesting is because

2643
01:21:27,841 --> 01:21:28,950
they have so much input.

2644
01:21:28,951 --> 01:21:30,840
There's so much variety in their input.

2645
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:31,913
Right?

2646
01:21:33,030 --> 01:21:33,863
Yeah.

2647
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:39,020
And when we all become connected and
some sort of a weird hive mind way.

2648
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:41,393
Yeah.

2649
01:21:41,610 --> 01:21:42,443
Is it,

2650
01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:45,720
is everybody more fucked up than we think?

2651
01:21:46,290 --> 01:21:49,200
There's a lot more fucked
up shit than we think.

2652
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:50,250
Yeah.

2653
01:21:50,250 --> 01:21:53,550
I think we based a lot of our
ideas of reality on media.

2654
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:54,030
Yup.

2655
01:21:54,030 --> 01:21:54,530
On,

2656
01:21:54,530 --> 01:21:55,231
when I say media,

2657
01:21:55,231 --> 01:21:57,870
I mean like fictional
depictions of pain songs.

2658
01:21:57,880 --> 01:21:58,650
Coldplay songs.

2659
01:21:58,650 --> 01:21:59,483
Yeah.

2660
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:02,970
And there's a lot of women to think
dudes are like the guy who Coldplay song

2661
01:22:04,860 --> 01:22:05,430
don't,

2662
01:22:05,430 --> 01:22:06,120
please don't.

2663
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:11,120
I have a whole like tangent on Rom coms
about how like what's a Romcom romantic

2664
01:22:12,931 --> 01:22:13,764
comedy,

2665
01:22:14,780 --> 01:22:19,780
how no self respecting dude
should ever take his girlfriend,

2666
01:22:21,331 --> 01:22:22,980
wife to any of those movies.

2667
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:23,970
Those move,

2668
01:22:23,970 --> 01:22:25,860
that's fucking terrorism right there.

2669
01:22:25,890 --> 01:22:26,760
Give me an example,

2670
01:22:27,420 --> 01:22:28,530
Jennifer Aniston movies

2671
01:22:31,050 --> 01:22:32,160
when she was like a cop,

2672
01:22:32,220 --> 01:22:32,820
that shit,

2673
01:22:32,820 --> 01:22:36,330
every fucking time it's selling one thing.

2674
01:22:36,450 --> 01:22:39,910
The grass being greener always Amy,

2675
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:40,920
you're the fucking,

2676
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:42,510
you're the current lawn.

2677
01:22:42,690 --> 01:22:43,523
You know what I mean?

2678
01:22:44,820 --> 01:22:47,550
You're in a current fucking
line and you're taking your,

2679
01:22:47,551 --> 01:22:48,660
you're taking like,

2680
01:22:48,661 --> 01:22:50,280
it's crazy to think that,

2681
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:51,271
oh,

2682
01:22:51,271 --> 01:22:53,490
we're just going to enjoy it and we're
going to laugh and whatever this and

2683
01:22:53,491 --> 01:22:53,610
that.

2684
01:22:53,610 --> 01:22:54,960
There is no Romcom.

2685
01:22:54,990 --> 01:22:55,680
There is no,

2686
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:56,070
no,

2687
01:22:56,070 --> 01:22:59,100
none of that structure
without the triangle.

2688
01:22:59,130 --> 01:23:04,130
The Love Triangle and the love triangle
opens the door to the third party.

2689
01:23:05,830 --> 01:23:06,041
See,

2690
01:23:06,041 --> 01:23:07,780
we don't work that way dudes.

2691
01:23:08,170 --> 01:23:09,010
For the most part,

2692
01:23:09,310 --> 01:23:12,310
we're like stimulated by
other shit as you know.

2693
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:14,530
But on that side of the fence,

2694
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:16,540
it's all imagination.

2695
01:23:16,810 --> 01:23:18,100
It's all like,

2696
01:23:18,330 --> 01:23:18,940
yeah,

2697
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:23,470
the fucking pool boy or the
the delivery man or whoever.

2698
01:23:23,890 --> 01:23:26,770
Someone's always going to treat
you better or whatever it is.

2699
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:28,270
And as you know,

2700
01:23:28,271 --> 01:23:29,011
anytime you're in a,

2701
01:23:29,011 --> 01:23:29,300
in a,

2702
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:30,190
in a relationship,

2703
01:23:30,191 --> 01:23:31,510
you learn really quickly that,

2704
01:23:32,260 --> 01:23:33,880
I think we talked about
this last time about,

2705
01:23:33,881 --> 01:23:34,061
you know,

2706
01:23:34,061 --> 01:23:34,161
the,

2707
01:23:34,161 --> 01:23:38,640
the honeymoon phase and how things change
and that's just part of growing and,

2708
01:23:38,740 --> 01:23:39,281
and whatever.

2709
01:23:39,281 --> 01:23:41,260
But in those movies it's never about that.

2710
01:23:41,261 --> 01:23:42,094
It's never about,

2711
01:23:42,310 --> 01:23:42,881
oh look,

2712
01:23:42,881 --> 01:23:45,760
they've been together forever
and they still fucking doing it.

2713
01:23:46,150 --> 01:23:46,660
Right.

2714
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:49,030
It's always some prettier
dude has to come along.

2715
01:23:49,170 --> 01:23:53,650
[inaudible] you're a fucking idiot if
you're taking your wife to that shit.

2716
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:54,310
Okay.

2717
01:23:54,310 --> 01:23:57,370
What should you take her
to I planet of the Apes,

2718
01:23:57,450 --> 01:24:02,380
Dystopia fucking version of reality
where gorillas become sentient and they

2719
01:24:02,381 --> 01:24:05,850
start getting machine guns and shooting
white people may mean that what we need.

2720
01:24:05,851 --> 01:24:06,160
No,

2721
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:07,120
maybe not that.

2722
01:24:07,180 --> 01:24:07,870
I don't know.

2723
01:24:07,870 --> 01:24:08,540
I don't know either.

2724
01:24:08,540 --> 01:24:09,940
I don't know how to solve that shit,

2725
01:24:09,941 --> 01:24:12,370
but all I gotta say
he's don't participate,

2726
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:14,440
but what have you enjoyed them?

2727
01:24:14,470 --> 01:24:14,681
No,

2728
01:24:14,681 --> 01:24:15,514
you don't.

2729
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:16,120
No.

2730
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:16,391
No.

2731
01:24:16,391 --> 01:24:17,290
It's not a chance.

2732
01:24:17,410 --> 01:24:18,640
It's fucking impossible.

2733
01:24:18,641 --> 01:24:19,660
Ryan Gosling movies,

2734
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:20,553
no way.

2735
01:24:22,540 --> 01:24:23,410
Drive maybe,

2736
01:24:23,590 --> 01:24:26,290
which I haven't seen and
tells him 21 jump street one.

2737
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:27,153
Who's the Guy Tatum?

2738
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:27,880
That guy,

2739
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:28,780
that handsome bastard.

2740
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:29,590
What about him?

2741
01:24:29,590 --> 01:24:30,760
Fuck 'em all man woe.

2742
01:24:32,260 --> 01:24:33,520
I take it back chatting.

2743
01:24:33,650 --> 01:24:34,483
I didn't mean it.

2744
01:24:34,810 --> 01:24:35,950
You gotta do what you gotta do.

2745
01:24:36,310 --> 01:24:37,090
And if you know,

2746
01:24:37,090 --> 01:24:37,901
if I look like that,

2747
01:24:37,901 --> 01:24:39,490
I'd probably do the same goddamn thing.

2748
01:24:39,491 --> 01:24:40,211
But truthfully,

2749
01:24:40,211 --> 01:24:40,711
like it's,

2750
01:24:40,711 --> 01:24:40,991
it's,

2751
01:24:40,991 --> 01:24:41,680
it's,

2752
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:46,680
it's weird how much we turn our lives
into the stories that we want them to be.

2753
01:24:47,740 --> 01:24:47,951
Well,

2754
01:24:47,951 --> 01:24:50,770
we've definitely pretend
we definitely pretend.

2755
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:51,620
And the,

2756
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:51,841
the,

2757
01:24:51,841 --> 01:24:52,171
the,

2758
01:24:52,171 --> 01:24:56,380
the other issue is that when that's
a part of the input of reality,

2759
01:24:56,381 --> 01:24:59,110
your drawer you're dealing
with like faulty data,

2760
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:01,750
you're dealing with
like fictional accounts,

2761
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:02,800
rive reality,

2762
01:25:02,801 --> 01:25:03,850
the fucking glitch.

2763
01:25:03,940 --> 01:25:05,680
A bunch of writers sat down.

2764
01:25:05,681 --> 01:25:06,431
They were in a room,

2765
01:25:06,431 --> 01:25:08,230
they worked for weeks lines.

2766
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:11,140
That would sound absolutely
ridiculous in the real world.

2767
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:13,180
Music plays when the guy delivers some,

2768
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,950
his head is 60 feet tall.

2769
01:25:15,130 --> 01:25:16,930
He's on a giant fucking screen.

2770
01:25:17,170 --> 01:25:17,981
The perfect words,

2771
01:25:17,981 --> 01:25:19,990
his features are perfectly symmetrical.

2772
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:21,400
Everything is wonderful.

2773
01:25:21,460 --> 01:25:22,330
So Dreamy.

2774
01:25:22,380 --> 01:25:22,580
Yeah,

2775
01:25:22,580 --> 01:25:23,413
I mean look,

2776
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:25,690
think about like what
they can do in movies.

2777
01:25:25,691 --> 01:25:26,524
Now Look,

2778
01:25:26,890 --> 01:25:30,400
how about the movie 300 those guys
didn't even really look like that.

2779
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:31,331
Like,

2780
01:25:31,331 --> 01:25:32,890
I remember when I saw that dude,

2781
01:25:32,891 --> 01:25:33,431
Gerard,

2782
01:25:33,431 --> 01:25:34,510
whatever the fuck his name is,

2783
01:25:34,660 --> 01:25:35,320
Butler.

2784
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:35,531
Yeah.

2785
01:25:35,531 --> 01:25:36,281
In real life.

2786
01:25:36,281 --> 01:25:36,750
And I was like,

2787
01:25:36,750 --> 01:25:36,820
oh,

2788
01:25:36,820 --> 01:25:41,820
look at this fucking flabby because
I couldn't handle that movie.

2789
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:42,460
Really?

2790
01:25:42,460 --> 01:25:42,860
No.

2791
01:25:42,860 --> 01:25:43,600
Why is that?

2792
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:47,140
It was too far beyond the realm
of what I was willing to accept.

2793
01:25:48,220 --> 01:25:50,230
I feel the same way about
a lot of Zombie Shit.

2794
01:25:51,530 --> 01:25:52,930
You know,

2795
01:25:53,290 --> 01:25:54,123
I was watching,

2796
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:56,500
I was like sorta off the
walking dead for a while.

2797
01:25:56,501 --> 01:25:58,660
I watched the first season and then,

2798
01:25:58,690 --> 01:25:59,170
you know,

2799
01:25:59,170 --> 01:25:59,560
I dunno,

2800
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:02,830
it got old for me because of
the zombies stopped being as,

2801
01:26:03,350 --> 01:26:04,100
as they were early

2802
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:04,510
on.

2803
01:26:04,510 --> 01:26:04,900
Right.

2804
01:26:04,900 --> 01:26:06,470
If they're all slow and shit now.

2805
01:26:06,590 --> 01:26:07,130
Yeah.

2806
01:26:07,130 --> 01:26:07,461
You know,

2807
01:26:07,461 --> 01:26:07,851
and it's like,

2808
01:26:07,851 --> 01:26:08,391
well fuck,

2809
01:26:08,391 --> 01:26:09,224
I don't know.

2810
01:26:09,290 --> 01:26:10,430
I want the zone.

2811
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:11,570
I want a dangerous zone.

2812
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:12,830
You want a 28 days later,

2813
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:14,600
Zombie love 28 days later.

2814
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:17,990
If I need to be afraid of something
like second nature for them,

2815
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:18,560
you know,

2816
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:18,731
to,

2817
01:26:18,731 --> 01:26:19,730
to kill them now.

2818
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:20,713
But anyway,

2819
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:22,340
I'm watching that shit and it's like,

2820
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:22,650
oh,

2821
01:26:22,650 --> 01:26:24,380
the girls look fucking awesome.

2822
01:26:24,650 --> 01:26:25,470
They got makeup,

2823
01:26:25,470 --> 01:26:26,120
they got makeup.

2824
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:26,321
They're,

2825
01:26:26,321 --> 01:26:26,590
they're,

2826
01:26:26,590 --> 01:26:27,380
they're prepped up.

2827
01:26:27,380 --> 01:26:29,990
I want to see the Real Zombie movie.

2828
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:31,520
People look like shit.

2829
01:26:32,090 --> 01:26:32,780
Well fuck it.

2830
01:26:32,780 --> 01:26:36,290
All of Hollywood needs to
tone down the appearance.

2831
01:26:36,530 --> 01:26:41,530
I that my suspension of disbelief in my
enjoyment of all of Hollywood is being

2832
01:26:41,601 --> 01:26:45,200
hindered by the fact that they can't
put normal looking people in stuff.

2833
01:26:45,350 --> 01:26:48,890
I was watching the Jurassic
Park trailer this morning.

2834
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:49,753
Looks Wild.

2835
01:26:49,790 --> 01:26:50,690
It looks wild,

2836
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:54,140
but at the same time I'm
thinking shit's hitting the fan,

2837
01:26:54,141 --> 01:26:56,930
this and that and the
fucking eyeliners perfect.

2838
01:26:58,040 --> 01:26:58,610
The bugs you.

2839
01:26:58,610 --> 01:27:00,150
It bugs the shit out of me.

2840
01:27:01,250 --> 01:27:06,250
How can anyone get excited about that
as a film maker like you at all costs?

2841
01:27:06,381 --> 01:27:09,650
Want this person to suspend disbelief
and pretend they were there for a minute?

2842
01:27:09,890 --> 01:27:10,051
Well,

2843
01:27:10,051 --> 01:27:11,900
beautiful women sell movies.

2844
01:27:11,930 --> 01:27:13,130
God beautiful people.

2845
01:27:13,131 --> 01:27:13,964
So movies,

2846
01:27:15,030 --> 01:27:16,280
I don't agree with that.

2847
01:27:16,460 --> 01:27:17,660
You come in the walking dead.

2848
01:27:17,661 --> 01:27:19,460
No one grows a fucking beard.

2849
01:27:19,490 --> 01:27:20,323
Hell yeah.

2850
01:27:20,330 --> 01:27:21,163
You know?

2851
01:27:21,170 --> 01:27:21,480
Hell,

2852
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:22,161
you grew a beard,

2853
01:27:22,161 --> 01:27:22,640
Rick.

2854
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:23,130
That's it.

2855
01:27:23,130 --> 01:27:25,220
He's the only one everybody
else has shaved out loud.

2856
01:27:25,430 --> 01:27:27,080
It doesn't make for a good billboard.

2857
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:28,393
Does that what else?

2858
01:27:28,670 --> 01:27:29,300
No one's growing.

2859
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:31,850
No one's like hairs growing
all fucked up and scraggly.

2860
01:27:31,851 --> 01:27:33,860
Their hair stays the
same length for years.

2861
01:27:33,890 --> 01:27:35,030
Same thing as the makeup.

2862
01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:37,730
They make certain concessions
to be more glossy.

2863
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:37,971
Well,

2864
01:27:37,971 --> 01:27:39,890
if you paying attention
to this recent season,

2865
01:27:39,891 --> 01:27:43,180
there's a woman in the recent season
that always has fucking lipstick on and

2866
01:27:43,181 --> 01:27:44,014
there you perfectly,

2867
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:47,600
perfectly like clean and press suit.

2868
01:27:48,110 --> 01:27:49,430
This is fucking ridiculous.

2869
01:27:49,431 --> 01:27:52,790
What self respecting person can
accept that in their content?

2870
01:27:52,850 --> 01:27:53,683
Come on.

2871
01:27:54,110 --> 01:27:56,870
If you watch movies from
back in the day before,

2872
01:27:56,871 --> 01:27:58,070
shit got all glossy.

2873
01:27:58,670 --> 01:28:00,950
You had people that looked
like regular people,

2874
01:28:00,951 --> 01:28:02,600
they'd be cast leading role.

2875
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:03,860
Teeth weren't perfect.

2876
01:28:04,070 --> 01:28:04,461
Like who?

2877
01:28:04,461 --> 01:28:05,150
Give me an example.

2878
01:28:05,150 --> 01:28:08,420
I don't know if you watch old Scorsese
movies like mean streets and shit like

2879
01:28:08,421 --> 01:28:09,180
that.

2880
01:28:09,180 --> 01:28:11,180
People had big noses,

2881
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:11,750
you know,

2882
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:12,071
I mean,

2883
01:28:12,071 --> 01:28:13,550
you don't even need a specific exam,

2884
01:28:13,551 --> 01:28:15,530
watch anything from 30 years ago.

2885
01:28:15,770 --> 01:28:16,790
And it's like wow.

2886
01:28:16,910 --> 01:28:17,743
Either,

2887
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:21,920
but that fucks with people's perception
of what now actually is and what they

2888
01:28:21,921 --> 01:28:24,170
need to do to participate
in that whole thing.

2889
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:25,333
Uh,

2890
01:28:25,370 --> 01:28:26,450
from an appearance standpoint,

2891
01:28:26,451 --> 01:28:27,380
it's like a,

2892
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:30,650
when you put so much emphasis
on the superficial stuff,

2893
01:28:30,830 --> 01:28:33,710
everything else like gene Hackman,

2894
01:28:34,510 --> 01:28:34,970
right?

2895
01:28:34,970 --> 01:28:35,241
Yeah.

2896
01:28:35,241 --> 01:28:36,200
That's a bad motherfucker.

2897
01:28:36,230 --> 01:28:37,380
That motherfucker right there.

2898
01:28:37,490 --> 01:28:38,030
There you go.

2899
01:28:38,030 --> 01:28:39,130
There's many examples of it,

2900
01:28:39,131 --> 01:28:39,320
George.

2901
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:40,070
See Scott.

2902
01:28:40,070 --> 01:28:40,800
There you go.

2903
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:43,340
You know who came to mind when
I originally thought of an ugly,

2904
01:28:43,430 --> 01:28:44,330
like right now,

2905
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:48,080
trying to think of a straight up ugly
and no offense to this individual,

2906
01:28:48,410 --> 01:28:53,410
but a straight up ugly leading
man Gerard Depardieu right.

2907
01:28:53,780 --> 01:28:56,450
But that's kind of like have
French thing and gone though.

2908
01:28:56,451 --> 01:28:57,284
He's gone.

2909
01:28:57,440 --> 01:28:58,273
He disappeared,

2910
01:28:59,420 --> 01:29:03,150
he vanished and he left a France.

2911
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:04,680
He doesn't even live in France anymore.

2912
01:29:04,980 --> 01:29:06,980
Gerardi Pardot because of this country.

2913
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:09,113
Didn't want to pay.

2914
01:29:10,350 --> 01:29:11,670
He drinks like six bottles of wine.

2915
01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:14,520
It's a stick of butter every time
the lights you see he's winning.

2916
01:29:14,610 --> 01:29:15,151
That's fine.

2917
01:29:15,151 --> 01:29:15,984
I'm cool with that.

2918
01:29:16,410 --> 01:29:17,550
But as far as like that,

2919
01:29:17,580 --> 01:29:18,413
that uh,

2920
01:29:18,450 --> 01:29:21,710
penetrated my force
field for content wise,

2921
01:29:21,711 --> 01:29:22,140
uh,

2922
01:29:22,140 --> 01:29:26,850
when Steve Buscemi got the leading
role on a boardwalk empire,

2923
01:29:26,970 --> 01:29:27,803
right.

2924
01:29:27,810 --> 01:29:28,643
I was like,

2925
01:29:29,390 --> 01:29:30,600
see you guys famous though.

2926
01:29:30,750 --> 01:29:31,950
If you break through,

2927
01:29:32,070 --> 01:29:33,330
if you find a way through it,

2928
01:29:33,331 --> 01:29:33,991
that's what I need.

2929
01:29:33,991 --> 01:29:34,711
That's what I'm saying,

2930
01:29:34,711 --> 01:29:36,660
but try and find another
dude from an like,

2931
01:29:36,661 --> 01:29:37,740
he looks like a creepy dude.

2932
01:29:37,741 --> 01:29:38,340
Right.

2933
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:38,850
He gives he,

2934
01:29:38,850 --> 01:29:41,790
and I'm sure he knows this because he
gets cast in those roles all the time,

2935
01:29:41,791 --> 01:29:43,530
so I'm not breaking any news here,

2936
01:29:44,010 --> 01:29:49,010
but for him to have the ability to sort
of be the face of an entire piece of

2937
01:29:51,450 --> 01:29:51,810
like,

2938
01:29:51,810 --> 01:29:52,230
uh,

2939
01:29:52,230 --> 01:29:55,920
the people are better looking on
even the Zombie Shit right now.

2940
01:29:55,921 --> 01:29:56,754
The walking dead.

2941
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:58,560
Even then he was in the gangster.

2942
01:29:58,570 --> 01:30:00,150
They could have cast
somebody better looking,

2943
01:30:00,151 --> 01:30:00,984
but they chose him.

2944
01:30:01,110 --> 01:30:03,180
He looks like a real guy
that I would encounter.

2945
01:30:03,570 --> 01:30:04,020
Yeah.

2946
01:30:04,020 --> 01:30:07,360
There are a lot of beautiful people
and then fucking walking dead show.

2947
01:30:07,361 --> 01:30:08,194
That's what I'm saying.

2948
01:30:08,470 --> 01:30:10,710
The the pretty girl that
has the Asian boyfriend,

2949
01:30:11,190 --> 01:30:11,760
she just,

2950
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:13,170
she never gets scraggly looking.

2951
01:30:13,190 --> 01:30:13,531
She was,

2952
01:30:13,531 --> 01:30:16,160
looks well fed her outfits like eyesight,

2953
01:30:16,180 --> 01:30:16,680
this outfit.

2954
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:17,700
You've got to remember I came,

2955
01:30:17,790 --> 01:30:18,810
I was watching the first season.

2956
01:30:18,811 --> 01:30:20,880
Now I'm just starting again right now.

2957
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:22,260
I'm looking at her outfits.

2958
01:30:22,261 --> 01:30:22,950
I mean,

2959
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:26,070
it looks like that could
be in a magazine right now.

2960
01:30:26,071 --> 01:30:26,251
You know,

2961
01:30:26,251 --> 01:30:27,270
that's sort of like dirty,

2962
01:30:27,271 --> 01:30:28,600
like look like a,

2963
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:29,610
she went hiking.

2964
01:30:29,610 --> 01:30:30,280
Yeah,

2965
01:30:30,280 --> 01:30:30,661
yeah,

2966
01:30:30,661 --> 01:30:31,201
exactly.

2967
01:30:31,201 --> 01:30:33,870
Like the sock goes above
the boot just a little bit.

2968
01:30:34,110 --> 01:30:34,301
You know,

2969
01:30:34,301 --> 01:30:34,561
it's like,

2970
01:30:34,561 --> 01:30:35,730
it's way too thought out.

2971
01:30:35,731 --> 01:30:37,740
I want to see fucking mayhem.

2972
01:30:37,950 --> 01:30:38,191
Well,

2973
01:30:38,191 --> 01:30:41,610
that's the thing about 28 days later
as opposed to like a television show,

2974
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:44,970
28 days later was fucking dark.

2975
01:30:45,510 --> 01:30:46,470
And the monsters,

2976
01:30:46,471 --> 01:30:47,304
the zombies,

2977
01:30:47,340 --> 01:30:49,050
they were so much more terrifying.

2978
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:50,040
100%.

2979
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:52,110
It was a much more realistic scenario,

2980
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:53,011
much closer.

2981
01:30:53,011 --> 01:30:54,950
And I was having this
Zombie discussion with,

2982
01:30:54,951 --> 01:30:55,380
uh,

2983
01:30:55,380 --> 01:30:59,790
with some people that I was watching
with and we were trying to think about

2984
01:31:00,090 --> 01:31:01,020
realistic,

2985
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:03,480
Realistic Zombie movies
and we couldn't even,

2986
01:31:03,630 --> 01:31:05,250
besides 28 days later,

2987
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:08,340
and it doesn't even make sense to say
realistic because there are no zombies.

2988
01:31:08,550 --> 01:31:09,150
But I mean,

2989
01:31:09,150 --> 01:31:11,790
closer to our interpretation
of what that might look like.

2990
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:12,030
Well,

2991
01:31:12,030 --> 01:31:14,910
if we considered the different
diseases that exist in nature,

2992
01:31:14,930 --> 01:31:17,520
the does the different
parasites to takeover bodies,

2993
01:31:17,850 --> 01:31:18,421
the different,

2994
01:31:18,421 --> 01:31:23,370
I mean there are some incredible parasite
host relationships in nature that are

2995
01:31:23,371 --> 01:31:24,210
absolutely real.

2996
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:24,690
Yeah.

2997
01:31:24,690 --> 01:31:25,081
You know,

2998
01:31:25,081 --> 01:31:25,914
uh,

2999
01:31:26,430 --> 01:31:29,180
back to another podcast I
was listening to about this,

3000
01:31:29,310 --> 01:31:34,270
the patient zero for for aids
and well yeah that was radio lab.

3001
01:31:34,330 --> 01:31:34,840
Yeah.

3002
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:39,840
I listen to that well and it made
the leap from like a perfect storm.

3003
01:31:40,410 --> 01:31:40,630
Well,

3004
01:31:40,630 --> 01:31:43,800
the crazy thing is that it
happened in the early 19 hundreds,

3005
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:44,220
right?

3006
01:31:44,220 --> 01:31:44,671
It happened.

3007
01:31:44,671 --> 01:31:47,190
They use the cut a hunter scenario,

3008
01:31:47,330 --> 01:31:52,330
so at the hunter killed a chimp and the
chimp had killed two different forms of

3009
01:31:53,671 --> 01:31:58,440
monkey in each one of those monkeys
had a different amine deficiency virus.

3010
01:31:58,441 --> 01:31:58,841
That's right.

3011
01:31:58,841 --> 01:32:00,580
And viruses combined

3012
01:32:00,580 --> 01:32:02,260
and made the jump to a person.

3013
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:02,740
Yup.

3014
01:32:02,740 --> 01:32:07,510
They were basically required the both
of them to be able to replicate in a

3015
01:32:07,511 --> 01:32:08,620
fashion that was,

3016
01:32:08,710 --> 01:32:11,470
that they were capable because the
immune system is actually fairly

3017
01:32:11,471 --> 01:32:15,730
sophisticated in both apes
and us that we'll find,

3018
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:18,190
find these kinds of
issues and wipe them out.

3019
01:32:18,550 --> 01:32:23,050
But this combination of the two of them
had all the necessary information to

3020
01:32:23,051 --> 01:32:24,610
build this super virus.

3021
01:32:25,750 --> 01:32:26,050
But,

3022
01:32:26,050 --> 01:32:26,560
uh,

3023
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:27,010
I,

3024
01:32:27,010 --> 01:32:27,940
when I was listening to that,

3025
01:32:27,941 --> 01:32:28,151
I was like,

3026
01:32:28,151 --> 01:32:28,984
man,

3027
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:31,060
any first of all,

3028
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:33,790
why the fuck are people
killing and eating apes?

3029
01:32:33,791 --> 01:32:34,780
That's a bad move.

3030
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:35,800
They've always been doing that.

3031
01:32:35,830 --> 01:32:37,180
I know it's happened forever.

3032
01:32:37,230 --> 01:32:37,450
No,

3033
01:32:37,450 --> 01:32:39,130
but you say it's a bad mood,

3034
01:32:39,131 --> 01:32:40,030
but when you're starving,

3035
01:32:40,210 --> 01:32:40,870
wow,

3036
01:32:40,870 --> 01:32:42,070
they'll kill and eat anything.

3037
01:32:42,550 --> 01:32:43,383
Right.

3038
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:48,490
I Dunno if you're GE so that genetically
similar consuming that tissue

3039
01:32:50,070 --> 01:32:50,710
that's like,

3040
01:32:50,710 --> 01:32:51,950
they think it's problematic.

3041
01:32:51,950 --> 01:32:52,071
Yeah,

3042
01:32:52,071 --> 01:32:52,391
sure.

3043
01:32:52,391 --> 01:32:52,871
But I mean,

3044
01:32:52,871 --> 01:32:54,220
you know that chimps,

3045
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:55,840
regular consume monkeys,

3046
01:32:55,890 --> 01:32:57,160
it's a huge part of their diet.

3047
01:32:57,190 --> 01:32:58,023
They do.

3048
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:00,310
Well that's fucking crazy.

3049
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:01,391
It's so crazy.

3050
01:33:01,391 --> 01:33:02,710
They prefer the organs.

3051
01:33:02,860 --> 01:33:04,570
So they eat the organs first,

3052
01:33:04,571 --> 01:33:05,710
which means they're eating the monkey,

3053
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:06,450
the alive,

3054
01:33:06,450 --> 01:33:06,730
right?

3055
01:33:06,730 --> 01:33:09,640
Like they grab the monkeys and
they eat them organs first.

3056
01:33:09,850 --> 01:33:14,850
There's a crazy fucking video of
these chimps and they set up this very

3057
01:33:15,131 --> 01:33:19,210
sophisticated hunting strategy where
they have chimps that are like running

3058
01:33:19,211 --> 01:33:23,460
forward that are like pushing these
monkeys towards these other champions.

3059
01:33:24,220 --> 01:33:25,750
And then they come in from the sides too.

3060
01:33:25,751 --> 01:33:29,170
And the capture and the trees and
they have this chimp grabbing,

3061
01:33:29,171 --> 01:33:34,150
this monkey is called [inaudible] monkey
and the monkey screw marine and the

3062
01:33:34,151 --> 01:33:34,961
chimp is eating.

3063
01:33:34,961 --> 01:33:36,130
I'm from the hips first,

3064
01:33:36,131 --> 01:33:40,270
just chill alive and the monkey just
screaming and the look in his face,

3065
01:33:40,271 --> 01:33:42,910
it's so human like and so is the chimp.

3066
01:33:43,350 --> 01:33:45,190
It's really hard to watch.

3067
01:33:45,191 --> 01:33:48,850
But that's the harsh
reality of of the jungle.

3068
01:33:49,330 --> 01:33:49,721
You know?

3069
01:33:49,721 --> 01:33:50,500
There's just,

3070
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:53,740
and people live there too and
they've always been shooting monkeys.

3071
01:33:53,770 --> 01:33:53,910
Yeah,

3072
01:33:53,910 --> 01:33:54,743
he's a new,

3073
01:33:55,450 --> 01:33:56,010
listen,

3074
01:33:56,010 --> 01:33:56,660
that radio lab,

3075
01:33:56,660 --> 01:34:01,480
I know that there's a new virus that
made a jump from a gorilla to a person,

3076
01:34:01,481 --> 01:34:04,540
a guy who shot and killed
a gorilla and has this,

3077
01:34:04,541 --> 01:34:07,330
there's a new like patient
zero that they were discussing.

3078
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:09,010
Like if you wanted to find a patient zero.

3079
01:34:09,011 --> 01:34:13,180
There's a guy that's infected with an
immune deficiency virus that came directly

3080
01:34:13,181 --> 01:34:13,980
from a gorilla.

3081
01:34:13,980 --> 01:34:14,813
Hmm.

3082
01:34:15,160 --> 01:34:16,780
What does that tell us about us though?

3083
01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:18,280
I not us.

3084
01:34:18,281 --> 01:34:18,760
It's them.

3085
01:34:18,760 --> 01:34:19,061
I know,

3086
01:34:19,061 --> 01:34:20,710
but it really freaked me out when I first,

3087
01:34:21,070 --> 01:34:22,540
when I first saw or heard about that.

3088
01:34:22,900 --> 01:34:25,520
I remember vividly when I,

3089
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:30,040
when I first found out about chimps
killing other chimps are killing other a

3090
01:34:30,070 --> 01:34:31,240
monkey monkeys.

3091
01:34:31,241 --> 01:34:33,970
Things that were really
similar to them to,

3092
01:34:34,060 --> 01:34:34,990
to eat for food,

3093
01:34:34,991 --> 01:34:35,824
whatever,

3094
01:34:36,130 --> 01:34:41,130
like that animal developed
as a carnivore or a omnivore.

3095
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:43,353
Right?

3096
01:34:43,450 --> 01:34:43,840
Chimps.

3097
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:44,560
Yeah.

3098
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:45,393
Like what,

3099
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:46,810
what,

3100
01:34:46,810 --> 01:34:47,643
what is it,

3101
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:48,280
what,

3102
01:34:48,280 --> 01:34:48,731
where,

3103
01:34:48,731 --> 01:34:51,910
where along the lines did they
start eating other animals?

3104
01:34:52,150 --> 01:34:53,500
Just vegetate forever.

3105
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:53,801
Yeah.

3106
01:34:53,801 --> 01:34:57,010
I mean probably with chimps probably
from the moment they became,

3107
01:34:57,380 --> 01:34:57,950
I mean,

3108
01:34:57,950 --> 01:34:58,160
the

3109
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:00,740
idea of being that animals,

3110
01:35:01,220 --> 01:35:06,170
I think the current theory is there
was climate change and that um,

3111
01:35:06,260 --> 01:35:11,260
some form of primates experimented
with different food sources.

3112
01:35:11,631 --> 01:35:13,760
That's why some primates
are still primary,

3113
01:35:13,850 --> 01:35:15,560
primarily vegetarians,

3114
01:35:16,250 --> 01:35:19,370
but the more intelligent ones were
the ones that started experimentally.

3115
01:35:20,020 --> 01:35:20,330
Yeah.

3116
01:35:20,330 --> 01:35:22,220
Because they had to to for two reasons.

3117
01:35:22,221 --> 01:35:22,440
It's,

3118
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:27,440
it's also one of the theories that is
bandied about when they tried to figure

3119
01:35:27,651 --> 01:35:31,040
out why human brains develop so quickly.

3120
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:35,150
Like the human brain size doubled
over a period of 2 million years,

3121
01:35:35,210 --> 01:35:38,480
which is apparently like the greatest
mystery in the entire fossil record

3122
01:35:38,481 --> 01:35:39,770
according to some biologist.

3123
01:35:40,340 --> 01:35:44,290
And one of the things they attributed to
might be the switch and diet or from a

3124
01:35:44,300 --> 01:35:45,133
strictly prep,

3125
01:35:45,260 --> 01:35:47,330
not just protein but resources.

3126
01:35:47,540 --> 01:35:50,540
Because in changing from a
strictly plant based diet,

3127
01:35:50,570 --> 01:35:54,290
your digestive system had to work less
hard because it wasn't processing as much

3128
01:35:54,291 --> 01:35:56,870
cellulose and there was more,

3129
01:35:56,900 --> 01:36:01,900
more resources available to think
about how to get these monkeys in,

3130
01:36:02,050 --> 01:36:05,630
eat them or how to get these bugs or how
to find these rodents or whatever the

3131
01:36:05,631 --> 01:36:06,800
fuck they were eating and killing.

3132
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:11,330
And then also the more intelligent
animals were more effective.

3133
01:36:11,450 --> 01:36:13,970
So the more the animals
that were more clever,

3134
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,000
they'd figured out how to use tools
if figured out hunting strategies.

3135
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:19,520
Those are the ones that were
more effective in eating meat.

3136
01:36:19,521 --> 01:36:22,400
And it was sort of a combination
like a perfect storm,

3137
01:36:22,700 --> 01:36:27,260
like having less resources to deal with
processing the cellulose and the plant

3138
01:36:27,261 --> 01:36:27,801
fiber.

3139
01:36:27,801 --> 01:36:29,110
And so you're the,

3140
01:36:29,111 --> 01:36:33,680
the internal organs actually changed
and altered over the period of time.

3141
01:36:33,890 --> 01:36:38,780
And in having less resources
necessary to digest this plant matter,

3142
01:36:39,290 --> 01:36:40,070
the uh,

3143
01:36:40,070 --> 01:36:42,440
animal had more resources
to grow its brain.

3144
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:43,070
Wow.

3145
01:36:43,070 --> 01:36:43,310
Yeah,

3146
01:36:43,310 --> 01:36:45,010
I saw a lot of weird shit that's,

3147
01:36:45,390 --> 01:36:47,420
it has to take place for many,

3148
01:36:47,421 --> 01:36:50,780
many years to develop development
and so on and so forth.

3149
01:36:50,781 --> 01:36:52,100
But yeah,

3150
01:36:52,101 --> 01:36:52,490
I just,

3151
01:36:52,490 --> 01:36:56,660
I don't know for me when to see them
in that kind of environment to see how

3152
01:36:56,661 --> 01:37:00,980
savage they could become and to know
that that's our closest relative.

3153
01:37:00,980 --> 01:37:01,820
Like when everybody ever,

3154
01:37:01,821 --> 01:37:06,821
anybody talks about us sort
of transcending our apelike
past and becoming far

3155
01:37:07,851 --> 01:37:10,280
more intelligent and not fucking
killing each other anymore.

3156
01:37:10,710 --> 01:37:11,240
You,

3157
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:11,450
you,

3158
01:37:11,450 --> 01:37:13,960
if you look to your closest
relative relative their violence,

3159
01:37:13,970 --> 01:37:14,390
hell,

3160
01:37:14,390 --> 01:37:14,841
that's true.

3161
01:37:14,841 --> 01:37:17,210
But isn't there like a spectrum
when you think about like,

3162
01:37:17,211 --> 01:37:17,451
okay,

3163
01:37:17,451 --> 01:37:22,250
there's the people that live in the jungle
that eat bushmeat bushmeat being the,

3164
01:37:22,310 --> 01:37:22,521
you know,

3165
01:37:22,521 --> 01:37:23,354
they'll eat anything,

3166
01:37:23,570 --> 01:37:24,680
they'll eat chimps.

3167
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:27,860
Gorillas is those people that
are eating that bushmeat.

3168
01:37:28,730 --> 01:37:33,590
But then there's also people here in
America that are primarily vegetarian and

3169
01:37:33,591 --> 01:37:35,450
they're concerned with their impact,

3170
01:37:35,451 --> 01:37:36,560
their carbon footprint,

3171
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:39,670
and they're concerned
with animal cruelty that,

3172
01:37:39,680 --> 01:37:39,861
you know,

3173
01:37:39,861 --> 01:37:41,210
they use only if they have,

3174
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:42,140
if they do eat meat,

3175
01:37:42,170 --> 01:37:46,040
it's organically sourced the free
range chickens for their eggs.

3176
01:37:46,090 --> 01:37:47,510
It's like a more,

3177
01:37:47,780 --> 01:37:52,780
more of a movement towards kindness then
for sure than the monkeys and chimps

3178
01:37:54,770 --> 01:37:57,060
that are living that
hard scrabbled jungle.

3179
01:37:57,120 --> 01:37:57,271
Oh,

3180
01:37:57,271 --> 01:37:59,040
there's no doubt that
were gentler than that.

3181
01:37:59,041 --> 01:38:02,460
And we're moving more towards
it being gentle in general.

3182
01:38:02,550 --> 01:38:03,420
So I mean that's,

3183
01:38:03,450 --> 01:38:04,290
that's the spectrum,

3184
01:38:04,291 --> 01:38:04,560
right?

3185
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:05,430
Isn't that the spectrum?

3186
01:38:05,431 --> 01:38:07,140
The people that are in the jungle still,

3187
01:38:07,260 --> 01:38:08,730
they're the ones that are
still eating the monkeys.

3188
01:38:08,810 --> 01:38:09,180
Right.

3189
01:38:09,180 --> 01:38:12,060
Very few people go on hunting
trips to go get monkeys,

3190
01:38:12,090 --> 01:38:12,810
but that's but dope.

3191
01:38:12,810 --> 01:38:14,430
But that shit's been a source of,

3192
01:38:14,990 --> 01:38:15,780
uh,

3193
01:38:15,780 --> 01:38:18,330
some of the world's most intense diseases.

3194
01:38:18,570 --> 01:38:19,200
Sure.

3195
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:19,680
AIDS,

3196
01:38:19,680 --> 01:38:20,280
Ebola,

3197
01:38:20,280 --> 01:38:21,000
whatever,

3198
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:21,620
whatever it is.

3199
01:38:21,620 --> 01:38:22,650
Also prions,

3200
01:38:22,651 --> 01:38:23,430
they carry,

3201
01:38:23,430 --> 01:38:24,720
if you eat chimp brains,

3202
01:38:24,721 --> 01:38:28,620
they carry very similar prions to the
prions that like you get from like mad cow

3203
01:38:28,621 --> 01:38:29,100
disease.

3204
01:38:29,100 --> 01:38:29,850
Yeah.

3205
01:38:29,850 --> 01:38:30,683
So it's like,

3206
01:38:31,260 --> 01:38:32,093
I dunno,

3207
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,170
aids where does it,

3208
01:38:34,830 --> 01:38:36,480
they were able to find patient zero,

3209
01:38:36,481 --> 01:38:38,910
but like where does it actually come from?

3210
01:38:39,510 --> 01:38:40,200
You know what I mean?

3211
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:45,180
Almost like nature's way of making the
most savage amongst us evolve because it

3212
01:38:45,181 --> 01:38:46,500
kills them off force.

3213
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:47,520
Forced evolution.

3214
01:38:47,521 --> 01:38:48,720
You think about what AIDS is.

3215
01:38:48,721 --> 01:38:48,901
I mean,

3216
01:38:48,901 --> 01:38:51,740
people would say you aids
is God punishing the Queens,

3217
01:38:51,741 --> 01:38:52,350
right?

3218
01:38:52,350 --> 01:38:52,710
Well,

3219
01:38:52,710 --> 01:38:54,360
maybe not,

3220
01:38:54,361 --> 01:38:59,361
but maybe it's nature's way of punishing
people that eat similar animals to what

3221
01:39:00,211 --> 01:39:00,780
they are.

3222
01:39:00,780 --> 01:39:01,290
Yeah.

3223
01:39:01,290 --> 01:39:05,220
And eating intelligent animals that are
closely related to you in some strange

3224
01:39:05,221 --> 01:39:07,650
way is how you develop those diseases.

3225
01:39:07,651 --> 01:39:12,651
And one of the big ones is mad cow
disease comes from people forcing fucking

3226
01:39:13,741 --> 01:39:14,790
cows to eat them.

3227
01:39:14,791 --> 01:39:15,650
How brains,

3228
01:39:16,020 --> 01:39:18,510
humans in New Guinea especially,

3229
01:39:18,530 --> 01:39:18,990
uh,

3230
01:39:18,990 --> 01:39:19,440
uh,

3231
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:23,190
cannibals in New Guinea have been
observed having the exact same symptoms.

3232
01:39:23,191 --> 01:39:26,850
It's called Jacob's Creutzfeldt disease
and it comes from being a fucking

3233
01:39:26,851 --> 01:39:27,350
cannibal.

3234
01:39:27,350 --> 01:39:27,570
Yeah.

3235
01:39:27,570 --> 01:39:30,780
It's like nature's trying to get rid
of the people so fucking stupid that

3236
01:39:30,781 --> 01:39:32,790
they're eating people so crazy,

3237
01:39:32,850 --> 01:39:36,990
so crazy that genetically speaking that
those alterations can take place through

3238
01:39:37,080 --> 01:39:38,190
particular activity.

3239
01:39:38,270 --> 01:39:38,700
Yeah.

3240
01:39:38,700 --> 01:39:39,230
You know,

3241
01:39:39,230 --> 01:39:40,740
it's almost like it's set up,

3242
01:39:40,770 --> 01:39:42,870
it's like nature set up
for you to figure it out.

3243
01:39:43,650 --> 01:39:44,670
If you look at today,

3244
01:39:44,700 --> 01:39:47,010
don't eat each other
in in this day and age,

3245
01:39:47,011 --> 01:39:51,000
what what we're dealing with in the
age of information and the amount of

3246
01:39:51,300 --> 01:39:55,140
resource that we have today is the highest
level of information that's ever been

3247
01:39:55,141 --> 01:39:56,190
available to human beings.

3248
01:39:56,191 --> 01:39:56,671
As far as we,

3249
01:39:56,671 --> 01:39:57,120
yes,

3250
01:39:57,120 --> 01:40:02,120
100% access to information that's ever
been available and in this day and age,

3251
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:06,300
people are generally
moving towards a kinder,

3252
01:40:06,301 --> 01:40:08,340
gentler way of living life.

3253
01:40:08,370 --> 01:40:08,790
Yes.

3254
01:40:08,790 --> 01:40:09,390
You know,

3255
01:40:09,390 --> 01:40:13,440
I'm a hunter and I take a lot of
shit from some people that have these

3256
01:40:13,441 --> 01:40:16,230
idealistic views of animals online,

3257
01:40:16,350 --> 01:40:17,790
but I understand where
they're coming from.

3258
01:40:18,090 --> 01:40:18,570
My,

3259
01:40:18,570 --> 01:40:21,630
my take on it is if
you understood animals,

3260
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:26,400
you would understand that the death
by a hunter is probably the cleanest,

3261
01:40:26,460 --> 01:40:27,240
easiest,

3262
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:31,350
safe as death in any of these animals
could go through and these animals are

3263
01:40:31,351 --> 01:40:32,250
going to die no matter what.

3264
01:40:32,280 --> 01:40:37,200
You would also understand that the amount
of protein that you can get from one

3265
01:40:37,201 --> 01:40:42,201
deer or elk or one moose like that one
animal dies and you could feed a family

3266
01:40:42,601 --> 01:40:43,650
for a year.

3267
01:40:43,740 --> 01:40:44,340
I mean,

3268
01:40:44,340 --> 01:40:45,240
you shoot a moose,

3269
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:47,640
you could feed a family
for a fucking year.

3270
01:40:47,930 --> 01:40:48,780
That's real.

3271
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:50,430
I just shot a 900 pound Moose.

3272
01:40:50,820 --> 01:40:53,070
I have 400 pounds of meat coming.

3273
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:55,670
That's 401 pounds at work.

3274
01:40:55,750 --> 01:40:56,770
I was wanting to ask you that.

3275
01:40:56,771 --> 01:40:57,970
So you shoot the Moose,

3276
01:40:58,570 --> 01:40:59,350
there's the meat,

3277
01:40:59,350 --> 01:41:00,183
like how does it,

3278
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:04,750
you can't obviously hop on an
airplane when I'm having it shipped,

3279
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:05,390
I'm having,

3280
01:41:05,390 --> 01:41:06,223
it's very expensive.

3281
01:41:06,520 --> 01:41:08,160
It must be frozen the whole way.

3282
01:41:08,500 --> 01:41:09,310
It has to be frozen.

3283
01:41:09,310 --> 01:41:10,250
So it's an,

3284
01:41:10,620 --> 01:41:12,730
and it's very difficult times.

3285
01:41:12,731 --> 01:41:14,900
People just take some of it
back and they lead to the,

3286
01:41:15,140 --> 01:41:15,973
to the guide.

3287
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:16,721
Like I have a friend,

3288
01:41:16,721 --> 01:41:20,380
my friend John is a guide up
in Alberta and he eats meat,

3289
01:41:20,410 --> 01:41:22,390
Moose meat all year round
because people give it to him,

3290
01:41:22,391 --> 01:41:23,620
but he also gives it to his neighbors.

3291
01:41:23,620 --> 01:41:24,190
He gives them,

3292
01:41:24,190 --> 01:41:25,870
they never buy meat from the store.

3293
01:41:25,871 --> 01:41:29,560
They eat everything that
they shoot or their clients.

3294
01:41:29,561 --> 01:41:29,950
Shoot.

3295
01:41:29,950 --> 01:41:30,701
He's an outfitter.

3296
01:41:30,701 --> 01:41:33,300
So he takes people to these
hunting environments and you know,

3297
01:41:33,310 --> 01:41:37,030
they have massive amounts of meat that
come from these animals and the animals

3298
01:41:37,031 --> 01:41:38,230
die like that.

3299
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:38,980
You know,

3300
01:41:38,980 --> 01:41:40,210
you shoot an animal with a gun,

3301
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:40,811
boom.

3302
01:41:40,811 --> 01:41:41,351
They follow up.

3303
01:41:41,351 --> 01:41:42,760
They didn't even know people are there.

3304
01:41:42,990 --> 01:41:43,823
Then all of a sudden they're dead.

3305
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:45,310
What does it take to take a moose down?

3306
01:41:46,120 --> 01:41:46,953
Big Rifle?

3307
01:41:46,970 --> 01:41:47,620
Yeah.

3308
01:41:47,620 --> 01:41:48,970
Seven millimeter Remington,

3309
01:41:48,971 --> 01:41:49,760
ultra mag.

3310
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:50,480
Boom.

3311
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:51,313
Where do you hit him?

3312
01:41:51,820 --> 01:41:54,760
The lungs is the best double lung
because you want to eat the heart.

3313
01:41:55,240 --> 01:41:56,800
You don't want to waste any of the organs.

3314
01:41:56,830 --> 01:41:57,730
The hearts are delicious.

3315
01:41:57,731 --> 01:41:58,564
Yeah.

3316
01:41:58,660 --> 01:41:59,290
Wow.

3317
01:41:59,290 --> 01:41:59,711
You want to eat?

3318
01:41:59,711 --> 01:42:00,544
I'll show you photos.

3319
01:42:00,790 --> 01:42:01,780
You want to eat the heart.

3320
01:42:01,900 --> 01:42:02,830
The heart is delicious.

3321
01:42:02,831 --> 01:42:04,420
Delivers Trisha's to very nutritious.

3322
01:42:04,420 --> 01:42:06,150
She don't want to ruin any
of the internal organs.

3323
01:42:06,151 --> 01:42:07,330
Some people don't eat Oregon's.

3324
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:07,991
I like him.

3325
01:42:07,991 --> 01:42:09,820
I think they're really good
for you and they taste good,

3326
01:42:09,850 --> 01:42:10,970
especially if you prepare them right.

3327
01:42:10,971 --> 01:42:13,870
You always watch on those nature shows
where like the lions will go for the

3328
01:42:13,871 --> 01:42:14,750
Oregon's first.

3329
01:42:14,780 --> 01:42:15,613
You're very nutritious.

3330
01:42:15,820 --> 01:42:16,331
The liver,

3331
01:42:16,331 --> 01:42:18,640
especially the liver
dictates what wolf is.

3332
01:42:18,641 --> 01:42:19,510
The alpha male.

3333
01:42:19,750 --> 01:42:21,880
The alpha male gets to
eat the liver first.

3334
01:42:22,150 --> 01:42:22,571
Really?

3335
01:42:22,571 --> 01:42:23,050
Yeah.

3336
01:42:23,050 --> 01:42:23,231
Yeah.

3337
01:42:23,231 --> 01:42:23,501
When?

3338
01:42:23,501 --> 01:42:28,210
When wolves take out an animal is there
was a guy who lived with wolves and he

3339
01:42:28,211 --> 01:42:33,040
had this a weird fucking set up in this
nature preserve where he was pretending

3340
01:42:33,041 --> 01:42:34,030
to be the Alpha male.

3341
01:42:34,031 --> 01:42:38,320
And one of the ways he showed dominance
is he would have a kill that they would

3342
01:42:38,321 --> 01:42:42,310
place and he would put a liver inside of
it and he would pull the liver out and

3343
01:42:42,311 --> 01:42:44,980
eat it in front of these wolves
and he would let them eat.

3344
01:42:45,670 --> 01:42:47,200
That was how he established himself.

3345
01:42:47,230 --> 01:42:49,060
And that's some gangster shit right there.

3346
01:42:49,420 --> 01:42:54,420
Very gangster and very crazy because
this guy wound up having to leave because

3347
01:42:54,551 --> 01:42:59,350
he had to go and leave the preserve to
help this local farmer who was getting

3348
01:42:59,351 --> 01:42:59,740
his,

3349
01:42:59,740 --> 01:43:00,310
his,

3350
01:43:00,310 --> 01:43:02,020
his animals are getting killed by wolves.

3351
01:43:02,110 --> 01:43:03,310
So he had a scare them off.

3352
01:43:03,460 --> 01:43:07,150
So they set up all these speakers and
put these wolf sounds and what they

3353
01:43:07,151 --> 01:43:10,300
basically tried to do was
pretend that a larger,

3354
01:43:10,301 --> 01:43:10,931
much larger,

3355
01:43:10,931 --> 01:43:12,700
much scarier pack had moved in.

3356
01:43:12,900 --> 01:43:17,590
And so they push these other wolves off
and he was gone for like a couple of

3357
01:43:17,590 --> 01:43:17,591
months,

3358
01:43:17,591 --> 01:43:18,190
I believe.

3359
01:43:18,190 --> 01:43:19,360
Well when he came back,

3360
01:43:19,361 --> 01:43:21,460
the wolves no longer
accepted him as the Alpha,

3361
01:43:21,580 --> 01:43:25,360
so he had to beg for his position in
the pack and the wolves were snarling,

3362
01:43:25,361 --> 01:43:26,920
Adam and the new alpha
was going to kill him,

3363
01:43:28,240 --> 01:43:33,190
and so this guy was in dire danger and
he was whimpering and cowering and he had

3364
01:43:33,191 --> 01:43:38,191
to completely bow down and submit to
this animal that was previously allowing

3365
01:43:38,351 --> 01:43:39,940
him to be the Alpha crazy.

3366
01:43:39,970 --> 01:43:40,380
But this,

3367
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:42,340
this wolf in the absence of the Alpha,

3368
01:43:42,341 --> 01:43:43,420
this wolf had taken over.

3369
01:43:44,470 --> 01:43:45,670
That's that hierarchy,

3370
01:43:45,671 --> 01:43:50,671
that social hierarchy that exists
within a pack that's got to be,

3371
01:43:50,980 --> 01:43:52,010
that's is that exclusive

3372
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:52,461
to wolves.

3373
01:43:52,461 --> 01:43:53,294
First of all,

3374
01:43:53,390 --> 01:43:58,390
know exists in chimps exams as laws
exists a lot of Alpha male and credit.

3375
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:00,140
Predatory animals,

3376
01:44:00,170 --> 01:44:01,130
not even just predatory.

3377
01:44:01,131 --> 01:44:01,281
I mean,

3378
01:44:01,281 --> 01:44:02,600
gorillas aren't predatory at all.

3379
01:44:02,601 --> 01:44:03,000
Gorillas,

3380
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:03,820
Vegetarians,

3381
01:44:03,820 --> 01:44:04,200
right?

3382
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:05,960
Having a female fight each other.

3383
01:44:06,050 --> 01:44:06,201
Yeah.

3384
01:44:06,201 --> 01:44:07,580
When you look at a gorilla's teeth,

3385
01:44:07,581 --> 01:44:08,840
those are for defense.

3386
01:44:08,900 --> 01:44:09,291
Those are,

3387
01:44:09,291 --> 01:44:10,160
those are for fighting,

3388
01:44:10,180 --> 01:44:10,451
right?

3389
01:44:10,451 --> 01:44:12,230
They don't eat anything but vegetables.

3390
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:15,620
How do they become the biggest crazy,

3391
01:44:15,650 --> 01:44:18,410
what was that AP we're talking
about on on some other pod condo.

3392
01:44:18,411 --> 01:44:19,430
Ape Bondo.

3393
01:44:19,431 --> 01:44:19,790
A,

3394
01:44:19,790 --> 01:44:21,430
the Bili or Bondo ape.

3395
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:22,010
It's a,

3396
01:44:22,010 --> 01:44:24,710
it's an enormous chimpanzee
but not as big as the gorilla.

3397
01:44:24,770 --> 01:44:25,130
No,

3398
01:44:25,130 --> 01:44:26,330
not quite interesting,

3399
01:44:26,390 --> 01:44:29,270
but really big nests on
the ground like a gorilla.

3400
01:44:29,271 --> 01:44:31,130
But there's very few photos,

3401
01:44:31,131 --> 01:44:31,930
very few,

3402
01:44:31,930 --> 01:44:32,763
uh,

3403
01:44:32,930 --> 01:44:34,160
like videos of them.

3404
01:44:34,340 --> 01:44:36,000
They have skulls though.

3405
01:44:36,001 --> 01:44:38,690
They know it's a complete subspecies
of that chimpanzee that actually has a

3406
01:44:38,691 --> 01:44:40,100
crest on its forehead.

3407
01:44:40,310 --> 01:44:41,390
Like a gorilla does.

3408
01:44:41,590 --> 01:44:42,560
Like a gorilla has like,

3409
01:44:42,561 --> 01:44:42,711
you know,

3410
01:44:42,711 --> 01:44:46,640
like almost like a Mohawk crest down
the center of his head and the enormous

3411
01:44:46,641 --> 01:44:47,720
biting muscles.

3412
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:48,580
Hmm.

3413
01:44:48,580 --> 01:44:48,791
Yeah.

3414
01:44:48,791 --> 01:44:49,371
That's interesting.

3415
01:44:49,371 --> 01:44:54,350
When like you have the long term
development of specific traits as an

3416
01:44:54,351 --> 01:44:55,340
identifier.

3417
01:44:55,410 --> 01:45:00,410
Like your body is reacting to the social
environment in a physical way if give

3418
01:45:00,411 --> 01:45:01,280
it given enough time.

3419
01:45:01,310 --> 01:45:02,150
What kind of makes sense?

3420
01:45:02,151 --> 01:45:04,460
If you think about the variety of humans?

3421
01:45:04,461 --> 01:45:05,300
I mean they're finding,

3422
01:45:05,390 --> 01:45:08,000
they're always finding
new species of humans.

3423
01:45:08,001 --> 01:45:12,590
Like they found this new human that lived
in Russia is recently as 40,000 years

3424
01:45:12,591 --> 01:45:13,070
ago.

3425
01:45:13,070 --> 01:45:14,660
Complete subspecies.

3426
01:45:14,990 --> 01:45:15,201
Like,

3427
01:45:15,201 --> 01:45:15,411
you know,

3428
01:45:15,411 --> 01:45:16,250
there's Neanderthal,

3429
01:45:16,251 --> 01:45:18,540
there's homosapien and there's that.

3430
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:19,550
The hobbit person,

3431
01:45:19,551 --> 01:45:20,960
they found the Flores.

3432
01:45:21,110 --> 01:45:23,750
That fucking thing was
alive 12,000 years ago.

3433
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:25,430
Wild 12,000 years ago,

3434
01:45:25,431 --> 01:45:27,500
there was a three foot tall monkey person.

3435
01:45:28,330 --> 01:45:29,330
Look at the variety,

3436
01:45:29,331 --> 01:45:31,040
just if people that exist right now,

3437
01:45:31,420 --> 01:45:36,420
just that you remember on a previous
podcast you were talking about,

3438
01:45:36,580 --> 01:45:37,250
uh,

3439
01:45:37,250 --> 01:45:38,360
that MMA fighter,

3440
01:45:38,361 --> 01:45:41,150
the transgender MMA fighter.

3441
01:45:41,180 --> 01:45:46,180
And then you also said like
African American females
have the same bone density

3442
01:45:46,970 --> 01:45:48,560
as an untrained males,

3443
01:45:48,590 --> 01:45:50,090
like a it Ma men who don't,

3444
01:45:50,210 --> 01:45:51,200
if you lift weights,

3445
01:45:51,410 --> 01:45:53,690
man who lift weights about
a higher bone density,

3446
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:54,500
alright,

3447
01:45:54,500 --> 01:45:56,240
then men who don't live weights,

3448
01:45:56,270 --> 01:45:56,600
right?

3449
01:45:56,600 --> 01:46:01,600
African American females have a very
similar bone density to white males who

3450
01:46:02,691 --> 01:46:03,524
don't lift weights.

3451
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:04,640
That's crazy.

3452
01:46:04,640 --> 01:46:05,250
Crazy.

3453
01:46:05,250 --> 01:46:10,250
And so then you would assume that African
American males have even bonded us

3454
01:46:11,661 --> 01:46:13,640
even thick and even higher bone density.

3455
01:46:13,641 --> 01:46:14,280
Yeah.

3456
01:46:14,280 --> 01:46:15,113
Yeah.

3457
01:46:16,250 --> 01:46:17,090
Bringing up the,

3458
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:18,710
bringing up the question of like,

3459
01:46:19,190 --> 01:46:21,890
because there's the argument in that
particular case was that she has a

3460
01:46:21,891 --> 01:46:22,820
strategic advantage,

3461
01:46:22,821 --> 01:46:23,240
right?

3462
01:46:23,240 --> 01:46:24,620
We're not just our physical city.

3463
01:46:24,621 --> 01:46:26,280
There's mechanical advantage shores,

3464
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:27,590
the hip size of the hand,

3465
01:46:28,100 --> 01:46:29,030
size of the jaw.

3466
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:31,520
The ability to absorb
punishments different varies.

3467
01:46:31,820 --> 01:46:35,000
But the also the argument
can be made across the board.

3468
01:46:35,001 --> 01:46:38,870
I mean there are some men that are way
more feminine and if they transitioned to

3469
01:46:38,871 --> 01:46:39,920
a transgender woman,

3470
01:46:39,921 --> 01:46:44,150
they would be way closer
to a biological woman.

3471
01:46:44,151 --> 01:46:48,170
Then if say like Mark Hunt
transition to being a female,

3472
01:46:48,350 --> 01:46:49,183
I mean that's a tough,

3473
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:49,891
you know,

3474
01:46:49,891 --> 01:46:50,160
take

3475
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:53,370
Brock Lesnar and turn them into a
transgender person like you gotta fucking

3476
01:46:53,371 --> 01:46:54,204
tough sell.

3477
01:46:54,840 --> 01:46:59,840
It's a very problematic when whenever
you're dealing with changing nature and

3478
01:47:00,991 --> 01:47:02,250
trying to balance things out.

3479
01:47:02,280 --> 01:47:02,670
Yes.

3480
01:47:02,670 --> 01:47:05,220
That's the argument against
testosterone replacement therapy.

3481
01:47:05,610 --> 01:47:10,610
Testosterone replacement therapy was
erroneous Lee aloud and then they realize

3482
01:47:10,681 --> 01:47:10,801
like,

3483
01:47:10,801 --> 01:47:10,981
well,

3484
01:47:10,981 --> 01:47:11,850
what the fuck are we doing?

3485
01:47:11,851 --> 01:47:12,750
We're allowing guys,

3486
01:47:12,751 --> 01:47:13,980
essentially it takes steroids.

3487
01:47:14,280 --> 01:47:17,520
The idea being that
some people were unfair,

3488
01:47:17,550 --> 01:47:20,690
it was an unfair disadvantage because
they didn't have as much testosterone so

3489
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:21,780
you allow them to take it.

3490
01:47:21,930 --> 01:47:25,440
But then guys were taking like
fucking alien levels of testosterone.

3491
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:25,981
I mean,

3492
01:47:25,981 --> 01:47:26,301
they,

3493
01:47:26,301 --> 01:47:31,301
they had one guy test at the average
person has between 300 and 600 like for a

3494
01:47:31,861 --> 01:47:33,510
really young healthy man,

3495
01:47:34,140 --> 01:47:35,790
milligrams to Nanogram,

3496
01:47:35,791 --> 01:47:36,624
whatever the fuck does,

3497
01:47:36,690 --> 01:47:37,340
but whatever the,

3498
01:47:37,340 --> 01:47:37,520
the,

3499
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:37,770
the,

3500
01:47:37,770 --> 01:47:38,790
the measurement is,

3501
01:47:38,970 --> 01:47:42,510
but this guy had 1,475 they,

3502
01:47:42,540 --> 01:47:42,751
you know,

3503
01:47:42,751 --> 01:47:44,460
and he was on the testosterone
place and you're like,

3504
01:47:44,490 --> 01:47:45,323
okay,

3505
01:47:45,480 --> 01:47:46,350
you fuck,

3506
01:47:46,590 --> 01:47:46,801
you know,

3507
01:47:46,801 --> 01:47:49,220
like ruin it for everybody
just ruined it for every,

3508
01:47:49,230 --> 01:47:49,981
you're juicing,

3509
01:47:49,981 --> 01:47:51,150
you're taking steroids.

3510
01:47:51,360 --> 01:47:53,130
And that's,

3511
01:47:53,460 --> 01:47:54,293
you know,

3512
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:56,910
it's like some people have
naturally high levels.

3513
01:47:56,960 --> 01:47:57,740
Yeah.

3514
01:47:57,740 --> 01:48:02,580
But there's also some people that have
naturally low levels and the argument is

3515
01:48:03,240 --> 01:48:07,050
some people are more athletically
inclined and there's some people that are

3516
01:48:07,051 --> 01:48:07,740
just,

3517
01:48:07,740 --> 01:48:09,300
they're just whatever they do,

3518
01:48:09,301 --> 01:48:11,430
they're going to have this
ectomorphic like Pudgy,

3519
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:11,940
buttery.

3520
01:48:11,940 --> 01:48:13,890
So for a long period of time,

3521
01:48:14,310 --> 01:48:17,790
presumably fighters were
fighting with testosterone.

3522
01:48:17,791 --> 01:48:18,624
No problem.

3523
01:48:19,060 --> 01:48:19,230
We'll,

3524
01:48:19,230 --> 01:48:20,460
they wasn't even,

3525
01:48:20,461 --> 01:48:21,990
it wasn't a thing that was restricted.

3526
01:48:21,991 --> 01:48:22,201
Right.

3527
01:48:22,201 --> 01:48:23,034
And adding it,

3528
01:48:23,220 --> 01:48:24,430
it was always restrict.

3529
01:48:24,431 --> 01:48:24,620
Totally.

3530
01:48:24,620 --> 01:48:25,081
It was,

3531
01:48:25,081 --> 01:48:25,500
yes.

3532
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:26,040
Always.

3533
01:48:26,040 --> 01:48:26,490
Yes.

3534
01:48:26,490 --> 01:48:29,070
Well before they were being tested.

3535
01:48:29,550 --> 01:48:30,080
This is,

3536
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:32,070
this is primarily speculations,

3537
01:48:32,071 --> 01:48:37,071
but based on a lot of evidence from
fighters from first account firsthand

3538
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:38,700
accounts of guys who actually did this,

3539
01:48:39,180 --> 01:48:43,110
a giant percentage of MMA fighters
in the early days were on steroids.

3540
01:48:43,260 --> 01:48:44,460
A giant percentage,

3541
01:48:44,490 --> 01:48:45,660
like a huge percentage.

3542
01:48:45,870 --> 01:48:47,550
90 something crazy.

3543
01:48:47,580 --> 01:48:47,730
Yeah.

3544
01:48:47,730 --> 01:48:47,941
Okay.

3545
01:48:47,941 --> 01:48:49,290
Let's say even if it's 60,

3546
01:48:49,291 --> 01:48:50,000
that's crazy.

3547
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:50,833
You know?

3548
01:48:50,970 --> 01:48:51,450
Um,

3549
01:48:51,450 --> 01:48:56,450
and then they started doing urine tests
and urine tests are essentially an

3550
01:48:57,241 --> 01:48:58,140
intelligence test.

3551
01:48:59,130 --> 01:49:01,380
All you have to do is cycle off.

3552
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:04,020
By the time you weigh in on,

3553
01:49:04,021 --> 01:49:04,500
you know,

3554
01:49:04,500 --> 01:49:08,970
fight day and or after your fight
and as long as you've cycled off,

3555
01:49:08,971 --> 01:49:11,880
you have all the benefits of taking
testosterone or whatever the fuck you're

3556
01:49:11,881 --> 01:49:14,190
taking and none of it
shows up in the urine test.

3557
01:49:14,580 --> 01:49:15,413
Then,

3558
01:49:15,470 --> 01:49:15,810
um,

3559
01:49:15,810 --> 01:49:18,390
people get caught even during
urine tests and they're like,

3560
01:49:18,420 --> 01:49:18,591
oh,

3561
01:49:18,591 --> 01:49:18,811
okay,

3562
01:49:18,811 --> 01:49:20,190
well you fucking dummies.

3563
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:23,190
You have made us want to
look deeper into this thing.

3564
01:49:23,730 --> 01:49:28,170
And then they started doing random
tests on people and then they started

3565
01:49:28,171 --> 01:49:29,040
catching a lot of people.

3566
01:49:29,041 --> 01:49:29,431
And then they said,

3567
01:49:29,431 --> 01:49:29,880
okay,

3568
01:49:29,880 --> 01:49:34,080
well we need to do is do really
heavy duty comprehensive blood test.

3569
01:49:34,081 --> 01:49:36,960
And that's what the UFC has
started doing fairly recently.

3570
01:49:37,140 --> 01:49:38,790
The problem is they're really expensive.

3571
01:49:38,820 --> 01:49:41,010
They're doing that to comply with what?

3572
01:49:41,430 --> 01:49:42,121
Not with anything.

3573
01:49:42,121 --> 01:49:43,320
No one's asking them to do it.

3574
01:49:43,321 --> 01:49:46,020
They're doing it because they want to
clean up the sport because the sport is a

3575
01:49:46,021 --> 01:49:47,680
huge image issue.

3576
01:49:47,681 --> 01:49:49,930
And also from a safety perspective,

3577
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:51,430
a person who is on testosterone,

3578
01:49:51,431 --> 01:49:56,431
say if you and another guy who were of
the same age or the same body type your

3579
01:49:56,741 --> 01:49:58,480
same weight and you decide to fight,

3580
01:49:58,481 --> 01:49:59,070
but you're,

3581
01:49:59,070 --> 01:50:02,830
your opponent is taking all sorts
of performance enhancing drugs,

3582
01:50:03,190 --> 01:50:06,850
it's conceivably possible and very
likely that he'll be able to hit you more

3583
01:50:06,851 --> 01:50:07,930
than you'll be able to hit him.

3584
01:50:08,080 --> 01:50:09,130
He'll have more endurance,

3585
01:50:09,131 --> 01:50:10,660
he'll be able to do more damage to you.

3586
01:50:11,230 --> 01:50:12,460
Not always.

3587
01:50:12,490 --> 01:50:14,740
There's a lot of people that have
been on steroids that have lost.

3588
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:17,350
So even though they had
an unfair advantage,

3589
01:50:17,530 --> 01:50:19,570
they didn't have the skill
level of their opponents.

3590
01:50:19,630 --> 01:50:20,560
So they've lost.

3591
01:50:20,770 --> 01:50:24,460
So here's a question for you
then in in that scenario,

3592
01:50:25,030 --> 01:50:27,250
what if both are on testosterone?

3593
01:50:27,550 --> 01:50:27,731
Yeah.

3594
01:50:27,731 --> 01:50:31,570
But then you're requiring people
essentially to compete at a fair level,

3595
01:50:31,571 --> 01:50:34,720
you're acquiring them to take something
that's going to fuck up their endocrine

3596
01:50:34,721 --> 01:50:35,554
system.

3597
01:50:35,560 --> 01:50:36,940
Because if you take testosterone,

3598
01:50:36,941 --> 01:50:37,720
you don't need it.

3599
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:40,030
If you're a person and like you know your,

3600
01:50:40,150 --> 01:50:41,890
your ball gets shot off in the war,

3601
01:50:42,190 --> 01:50:42,461
you know,

3602
01:50:42,461 --> 01:50:43,690
and you know you're not producing it.

3603
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:45,190
I mean that was pretty specific.

3604
01:50:45,490 --> 01:50:46,323
I don't know why I said that.

3605
01:50:47,170 --> 01:50:47,441
Okay.

3606
01:50:47,441 --> 01:50:48,160
You know,

3607
01:50:48,160 --> 01:50:50,110
for whatever reason and you,

3608
01:50:50,111 --> 01:50:50,944
um,

3609
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:53,800
you are allowed to take a hormone,

3610
01:50:53,801 --> 01:50:54,634
that's one thing.

3611
01:50:54,670 --> 01:50:59,500
But if you're a person like you who's
young and healthy and you just choose to

3612
01:50:59,501 --> 01:51:03,040
do it to give yourself an advantage and
then you force your opponent to do it,

3613
01:51:03,041 --> 01:51:03,874
to give him an advice,

3614
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:04,151
you know,

3615
01:51:04,151 --> 01:51:06,190
he has to do it in order
to keep up with you.

3616
01:51:06,730 --> 01:51:11,730
The issue is his body doesn't
need like extra testosterone.

3617
01:51:11,921 --> 01:51:13,150
He's adding it to it.

3618
01:51:13,151 --> 01:51:14,440
So your body is confused.

3619
01:51:14,680 --> 01:51:16,530
Even though it's a performance
enhancing substance,

3620
01:51:16,540 --> 01:51:18,760
your body is confused as to
why the levels are so high.

3621
01:51:18,910 --> 01:51:22,510
So your body stops producing
natural endogenous testosterone.

3622
01:51:22,810 --> 01:51:23,830
That becomes a problem.

3623
01:51:23,950 --> 01:51:27,460
And that's how they got around these
tests for the longest time because they

3624
01:51:27,461 --> 01:51:29,830
said my client needs testosterone.

3625
01:51:29,831 --> 01:51:34,060
Why look at his blood tests and the
blood tests showed a very low level of

3626
01:51:34,061 --> 01:51:37,630
testosterone would they didn't show is
the reason why it was low is cause he was

3627
01:51:37,631 --> 01:51:42,410
taking extra testosterone and it forces
endocrine system to freak out and be

3628
01:51:42,420 --> 01:51:45,100
consistent with the guy
who's getting 1,475 is I go,

3629
01:51:45,101 --> 01:51:46,920
we don't need to make
fucking testosterone.

3630
01:51:47,110 --> 01:51:47,943
We got plenty.

3631
01:51:48,280 --> 01:51:48,491
Yeah.

3632
01:51:48,491 --> 01:51:50,650
But see the argument being,

3633
01:51:51,160 --> 01:51:55,000
obviously I've heard it
mostly applied to baseball.

3634
01:51:55,480 --> 01:51:57,430
It if it seems like
baseball was the big issue,

3635
01:51:57,431 --> 01:51:59,130
they had guys in the courtroom room,

3636
01:51:59,240 --> 01:52:00,160
whatever it was.

3637
01:52:00,820 --> 01:52:02,680
And then there was this
counter argument which,

3638
01:52:02,681 --> 01:52:03,251
which was like,

3639
01:52:03,251 --> 01:52:05,020
well don't you want to see home runs?

3640
01:52:05,170 --> 01:52:05,381
See,

3641
01:52:05,381 --> 01:52:06,730
but that's different in MMA.

3642
01:52:07,330 --> 01:52:12,220
MMA is you're dealing with a sport that's
primary objective is to damage your

3643
01:52:12,221 --> 01:52:12,640
opponent.

3644
01:52:12,640 --> 01:52:13,180
Right.

3645
01:52:13,180 --> 01:52:18,070
And if you can give someone that lets
them damaged their opponent better,

3646
01:52:18,071 --> 01:52:19,180
more efficiently,

3647
01:52:19,400 --> 01:52:22,060
you're essentially allowing
them to create a crime.

3648
01:52:22,061 --> 01:52:22,571
I mean this,

3649
01:52:22,571 --> 01:52:25,180
that's been the argument
by people who are clean.

3650
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:27,430
No athletes who don't take it like you're,

3651
01:52:27,431 --> 01:52:28,050
you're,

3652
01:52:28,050 --> 01:52:29,230
it's like assault.

3653
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:33,220
Like what you're doing is like you're
hitting them more than you should be able

3654
01:52:33,221 --> 01:52:33,461
to.

3655
01:52:33,461 --> 01:52:35,440
You were cheating and cheating.

3656
01:52:35,441 --> 01:52:39,160
You're causing damage to your opponent
and you should be perhaps responsible for

3657
01:52:39,161 --> 01:52:41,230
that damage that you
caused to your opponent.

3658
01:52:41,260 --> 01:52:41,860
Wow.

3659
01:52:41,860 --> 01:52:42,700
Do you agree with that?

3660
01:52:42,910 --> 01:52:43,150
Yeah,

3661
01:52:43,150 --> 01:52:43,360
it's,

3662
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:44,440
it's a very good argument.

3663
01:52:44,480 --> 01:52:45,110
So I mean,

3664
01:52:45,110 --> 01:52:46,070
a logical argument,

3665
01:52:46,071 --> 01:52:48,140
it's like many things in life.

3666
01:52:48,170 --> 01:52:49,610
Like the transgender argument,

3667
01:52:49,611 --> 01:52:50,840
it's not a gray,

3668
01:52:50,870 --> 01:52:52,190
it's not a black and white issue.

3669
01:52:52,210 --> 01:52:52,810
Yeah.

3670
01:52:52,810 --> 01:52:53,151
You know,

3671
01:52:53,151 --> 01:52:55,370
I've always said that I'm in
favor of men fighting women.

3672
01:52:55,371 --> 01:52:56,330
If the woman wants a fight,

3673
01:52:56,331 --> 01:52:56,930
a man,

3674
01:52:56,930 --> 01:52:57,650
I'm going to fit.

3675
01:52:57,650 --> 01:52:59,480
If I'm in favor of people riding bowls,

3676
01:52:59,870 --> 01:53:01,190
I'm in favor of people.

3677
01:53:01,191 --> 01:53:01,371
You know,

3678
01:53:01,371 --> 01:53:02,390
you want to wrestle a bear.

3679
01:53:02,410 --> 01:53:02,810
OOPS,

3680
01:53:02,810 --> 01:53:03,680
I'm not stopping you.

3681
01:53:03,980 --> 01:53:08,840
If you're a grown adult with a functional
mind and you understand the risks and

3682
01:53:08,841 --> 01:53:10,520
that you want to do whatever
the fuck you want to do,

3683
01:53:11,900 --> 01:53:12,740
you want to do it,

3684
01:53:13,070 --> 01:53:13,940
you go right ahead.

3685
01:53:13,970 --> 01:53:15,230
I don't have any problem with it,

3686
01:53:15,410 --> 01:53:16,850
but there's a,

3687
01:53:17,060 --> 01:53:17,361
you know,

3688
01:53:17,361 --> 01:53:18,560
you're at a disadvantage.

3689
01:53:18,860 --> 01:53:20,240
If a woman wants to fight a man,

3690
01:53:20,330 --> 01:53:21,290
there's no doubt about it.

3691
01:53:21,291 --> 01:53:22,510
She's at a physical disadvantage.

3692
01:53:22,550 --> 01:53:24,380
Doesn't mean that a
woman can't beat a man.

3693
01:53:24,530 --> 01:53:25,580
It is possible.

3694
01:53:25,610 --> 01:53:29,360
There's most certainly possible that a
woman who's highly skilled could beat a

3695
01:53:29,361 --> 01:53:30,770
man that's the same size as her,

3696
01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:33,620
but it's also possible she
get knocked the fuck out.

3697
01:53:33,800 --> 01:53:34,011
You know?

3698
01:53:34,011 --> 01:53:35,030
That's possible too.

3699
01:53:35,270 --> 01:53:36,500
And there was a woman named Lucy,

3700
01:53:36,501 --> 01:53:38,660
a Riker who's a famous MMA fighter,

3701
01:53:38,690 --> 01:53:39,860
or do you watch it to rather?

3702
01:53:39,950 --> 01:53:40,783
What'd you watch it?

3703
01:53:41,540 --> 01:53:42,560
I've watched everything,

3704
01:53:42,561 --> 01:53:42,980
Dude.

3705
01:53:42,980 --> 01:53:44,270
I can't say I wouldn't really,

3706
01:53:44,290 --> 01:53:46,580
I watch everything you would watch.

3707
01:53:46,610 --> 01:53:49,520
Let's say Rhonda Rousey fight a man.

3708
01:53:49,550 --> 01:53:50,030
Yes,

3709
01:53:50,030 --> 01:53:53,780
I would most certainly want killed and
actual dude from the same weight class.

3710
01:53:54,020 --> 01:53:55,330
I don't think she would fare well.

3711
01:53:55,700 --> 01:53:58,550
But if she wanted to do it and
it was going to be on television,

3712
01:53:58,580 --> 01:53:59,570
I'll probably watch it.

3713
01:53:59,900 --> 01:54:00,733
I'm going to be honest.

3714
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:01,250
Wow.

3715
01:54:01,250 --> 01:54:01,461
Yeah.

3716
01:54:01,461 --> 01:54:01,950
I mean it's,

3717
01:54:01,950 --> 01:54:02,661
what am I going to do?

3718
01:54:02,661 --> 01:54:03,600
I'm not watching it.

3719
01:54:04,040 --> 01:54:04,681
I don't know.

3720
01:54:04,681 --> 01:54:05,890
I'm just saying courage it.

3721
01:54:05,900 --> 01:54:07,130
And she called me up and said,

3722
01:54:07,131 --> 01:54:07,341
hey,

3723
01:54:07,341 --> 01:54:07,971
what should I do?

3724
01:54:07,971 --> 01:54:08,271
I'd say,

3725
01:54:08,271 --> 01:54:08,900
don't do it.

3726
01:54:08,900 --> 01:54:12,140
I agree with you that it would be a tough,

3727
01:54:12,320 --> 01:54:13,550
a tough one for her.

3728
01:54:13,550 --> 01:54:14,240
Right.

3729
01:54:14,240 --> 01:54:15,230
So because of that,

3730
01:54:15,260 --> 01:54:18,410
I feel like I can already predict the
outcome and I wouldn't want to see that.

3731
01:54:19,160 --> 01:54:19,790
Maybe,

3732
01:54:19,790 --> 01:54:21,470
maybe she arm bars a fuck that dude.

3733
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:21,980
Right.

3734
01:54:21,980 --> 01:54:22,791
That's possible too.

3735
01:54:22,791 --> 01:54:23,060
Right.

3736
01:54:23,060 --> 01:54:23,781
But it's a dangerous,

3737
01:54:23,781 --> 01:54:26,840
maybe we'll think about the
early UFC like Royce Gracie,

3738
01:54:26,841 --> 01:54:28,250
fuck chemo for instance.

3739
01:54:28,490 --> 01:54:30,680
Kimo was far stronger,

3740
01:54:30,681 --> 01:54:31,730
far larger,

3741
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,160
far more powerful.

3742
01:54:34,161 --> 01:54:36,200
And his ability to deliver
strikes and hoist was,

3743
01:54:36,380 --> 01:54:37,250
but I always got him,

3744
01:54:37,580 --> 01:54:39,020
he's fucking had a war.

3745
01:54:39,200 --> 01:54:39,741
He duked it out.

3746
01:54:39,741 --> 01:54:42,080
But his greater skill level prevailed.

3747
01:54:42,081 --> 01:54:44,540
And that was the essence of what the UFC,

3748
01:54:44,541 --> 01:54:45,920
what made the UFC so special.

3749
01:54:46,100 --> 01:54:47,810
It was completely unfair.

3750
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:49,370
He had one,

3751
01:54:49,370 --> 01:54:49,641
you know,

3752
01:54:49,641 --> 01:54:53,450
quote unquote professional fighters to
the word professional is a very loose

3753
01:54:53,451 --> 01:54:53,841
term,

3754
01:54:53,841 --> 01:54:54,680
something technique.

3755
01:54:55,010 --> 01:54:59,330
I mean chemo most certainly eventually
became a legit professional fighter,

3756
01:54:59,480 --> 01:55:00,231
no doubt about it.

3757
01:55:00,231 --> 01:55:01,190
But back in the day,

3758
01:55:01,370 --> 01:55:03,800
he was a martial artist who
is competing in the UFC.

3759
01:55:04,250 --> 01:55:09,250
He was like 200 fucking 60 pounds and
hoists was one 75 I mean Kimo was jacked.

3760
01:55:10,970 --> 01:55:12,200
I need just chat.

3761
01:55:13,250 --> 01:55:16,190
He came in carrying a fucking
giant wooden cross on his back.

3762
01:55:16,191 --> 01:55:17,840
I mean the whole thing was craziness.

3763
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:20,750
So without a doubt he had
physical advantages over hoists,

3764
01:55:21,170 --> 01:55:23,840
but hoists his skill level
allowed him to prevail.

3765
01:55:23,930 --> 01:55:24,410
Right.

3766
01:55:24,410 --> 01:55:26,000
So if that's legal,

3767
01:55:26,030 --> 01:55:30,140
why wouldn't it be legal for Rhonda to
fight a man who has her same weight?

3768
01:55:30,590 --> 01:55:30,771
Well,

3769
01:55:30,771 --> 01:55:33,860
I guess I guess there's a
difference between legal.

3770
01:55:33,950 --> 01:55:36,650
Obviously I don't think
it should be illegal,

3771
01:55:36,980 --> 01:55:41,960
but I guess I've just part personally
I feel like I could fairly fairly

3772
01:55:41,961 --> 01:55:42,860
accurately predict the,

3773
01:55:43,230 --> 01:55:44,370
and then not want to see that outcome.

3774
01:55:44,510 --> 01:55:46,500
It all depends on skill level.

3775
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:46,951
So like,

3776
01:55:46,951 --> 01:55:47,760
let's take,

3777
01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:48,451
let's take a,

3778
01:55:48,451 --> 01:55:48,961
for instance,

3779
01:55:48,961 --> 01:55:53,961
let's take a middle of the road MMA
fighter fights at 155 pounds and make him

3780
01:55:55,171 --> 01:55:56,730
fight Cain Velasquez.

3781
01:55:56,880 --> 01:55:59,100
He's going to get fucking steamrolled.

3782
01:55:59,370 --> 01:56:04,370
But let's take Hixon Gracie when he was
in his prime and make him fight a guy

3783
01:56:06,211 --> 01:56:08,160
who's the same size as cane,

3784
01:56:08,280 --> 01:56:09,720
but does know what the fuck he's doing.

3785
01:56:09,870 --> 01:56:10,820
He did that before it,

3786
01:56:10,821 --> 01:56:12,210
when Hickson was like 19.

3787
01:56:12,211 --> 01:56:13,410
He fought this Guy Zulu,

3788
01:56:13,620 --> 01:56:18,620
who's just enormous fucking super muscular
dude that Hixon fought in Brazil and

3789
01:56:18,991 --> 01:56:20,340
Hixon beat his ass twice.

3790
01:56:20,490 --> 01:56:21,810
He got his back and strangle them.

3791
01:56:21,811 --> 01:56:22,320
Right.

3792
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:23,580
He weathered the storm,

3793
01:56:24,120 --> 01:56:26,970
had this fucking giant guy smashing
them and jumping all over him,

3794
01:56:26,971 --> 01:56:29,250
but he eventually used a
skill level to defeat them.

3795
01:56:29,430 --> 01:56:32,130
So it's skill level is relative.

3796
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:34,500
It's a huge issue in the contest.

3797
01:56:34,540 --> 01:56:34,690
Yeah,

3798
01:56:34,690 --> 01:56:34,861
yeah,

3799
01:56:34,861 --> 01:56:35,130
yeah.

3800
01:56:35,130 --> 01:56:36,930
Physical got to have the combination.

3801
01:56:36,931 --> 01:56:37,140
Right.

3802
01:56:37,140 --> 01:56:37,710
For sure.

3803
01:56:37,710 --> 01:56:38,370
Right.

3804
01:56:38,370 --> 01:56:39,203
I guess I just,

3805
01:56:39,330 --> 01:56:39,620
it's,

3806
01:56:39,620 --> 01:56:41,130
it's interesting because they put,

3807
01:56:41,470 --> 01:56:42,750
I was looking at the,

3808
01:56:42,870 --> 01:56:43,410
uh,

3809
01:56:43,410 --> 01:56:46,680
what does it pound for pound thing and
they put Ronda Rousey on the pound on the

3810
01:56:46,681 --> 01:56:47,700
pound for pound thing.

3811
01:56:47,910 --> 01:56:48,691
What does she fight at?

3812
01:56:48,691 --> 01:56:50,190
One 35 yes.

3813
01:56:50,250 --> 01:56:50,790
Yeah.

3814
01:56:50,790 --> 01:56:51,623
And so,

3815
01:56:52,140 --> 01:56:52,531
you know,

3816
01:56:52,531 --> 01:56:53,191
I don't know that sad.

3817
01:56:53,191 --> 01:56:54,270
I guess that's what stood out to me.

3818
01:56:54,271 --> 01:56:55,104
Like it doesn't even,

3819
01:56:55,290 --> 01:56:55,561
I don't know.

3820
01:56:55,561 --> 01:56:56,640
To me it didn't make sense.

3821
01:56:56,790 --> 01:56:58,560
Well women's MMA,

3822
01:56:58,561 --> 01:56:59,394
she's number one.

3823
01:56:59,520 --> 01:56:59,880
Oh,

3824
01:56:59,880 --> 01:57:00,600
I know.

3825
01:57:00,600 --> 01:57:02,100
Hands Down for sure.

3826
01:57:02,160 --> 01:57:03,570
But she was in the list with the dude.

3827
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:04,110
Yeah.

3828
01:57:04,110 --> 01:57:04,381
Let's see.

3829
01:57:04,381 --> 01:57:05,430
That's tricky.

3830
01:57:06,030 --> 01:57:06,721
It's tricky.

3831
01:57:06,721 --> 01:57:08,100
I mean it's very subjective.

3832
01:57:08,101 --> 01:57:10,800
The pound for pound list is
very subjective in my opinion.

3833
01:57:10,801 --> 01:57:12,780
Is Mighty Mouse Johnson's the best?

3834
01:57:13,110 --> 01:57:17,640
He fights at one 25 when I look at
like technically what he's able to do.

3835
01:57:17,830 --> 01:57:18,020
Right.

3836
01:57:18,020 --> 01:57:18,221
I don't,

3837
01:57:18,221 --> 01:57:21,030
I don't think there's anybody like
him in MMA does everything perfect.

3838
01:57:21,300 --> 01:57:26,160
But a lot of people don't think of him
as number one because he fights it 125

3839
01:57:26,161 --> 01:57:26,910
pounds.

3840
01:57:26,910 --> 01:57:29,790
He's a small guy and you know,

3841
01:57:29,791 --> 01:57:32,760
they look at like John
Jones who's also elite.

3842
01:57:32,790 --> 01:57:33,810
I mean so good.

3843
01:57:33,960 --> 01:57:37,290
But he's two oh five so you think of John
Jones being the number one guy because

3844
01:57:37,291 --> 01:57:38,670
he's knocking guys out.

3845
01:57:38,980 --> 01:57:39,870
Just submitting guys.

3846
01:57:39,871 --> 01:57:42,330
But Demetrius is doing things perfectly.

3847
01:57:42,340 --> 01:57:44,280
Like if you've scaled up Demetrius,

3848
01:57:44,610 --> 01:57:45,443
oh my God,

3849
01:57:45,660 --> 01:57:46,650
if you make Demetrius,

3850
01:57:46,651 --> 01:57:49,170
if he can move the way he
moves and he'd be 250 pounds.

3851
01:57:49,320 --> 01:57:49,580
Yeah,

3852
01:57:49,580 --> 01:57:52,200
it'd be the greatest fighter
the world has ever known.

3853
01:57:52,201 --> 01:57:52,560
Right.

3854
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:54,300
But some of it's relevant relative too,

3855
01:57:54,301 --> 01:57:54,870
right?

3856
01:57:54,870 --> 01:57:55,380
Because he,

3857
01:57:55,380 --> 01:57:56,890
is he facing the same competition?

3858
01:57:56,920 --> 01:57:57,060
No,

3859
01:57:57,060 --> 01:57:57,660
he's not.

3860
01:57:57,660 --> 01:58:00,030
And he's also not facing the
same amount of dangerous.

3861
01:58:00,031 --> 01:58:02,610
The amount of people that get knocked
out in the flyweight division is

3862
01:58:02,611 --> 01:58:05,030
relatively small in
comparison to the night now,

3863
01:58:05,160 --> 01:58:07,980
number of people that get knocked out in
the heavyweight division holding onto a

3864
01:58:07,981 --> 01:58:09,060
few extra brain cells,

3865
01:58:09,320 --> 01:58:11,910
there's a point of diminishing returns
and it comes to the ability to deliver

3866
01:58:11,911 --> 01:58:12,660
power.

3867
01:58:12,660 --> 01:58:17,040
When you think about like what a 250
pound man can deliver and how much 250

3868
01:58:17,041 --> 01:58:18,090
pound man can take.

3869
01:58:18,120 --> 01:58:18,630
Yes.

3870
01:58:18,630 --> 01:58:23,630
As opposed to what 125 pound man can
deliver and what 125 pound man can take.

3871
01:58:24,060 --> 01:58:26,610
It's like at the heavyweight man,

3872
01:58:26,611 --> 01:58:28,080
when guys land big shots,

3873
01:58:28,081 --> 01:58:29,400
even the best guys go down.

3874
01:58:29,430 --> 01:58:30,263
Even Cain,

3875
01:58:30,300 --> 01:58:33,720
Cain got clipped by one punch by junior
dos Santos and his legs went out and he

3876
01:58:33,721 --> 01:58:34,390
went unconscious.

3877
01:58:34,390 --> 01:58:34,800
Yeah,

3878
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:35,633
at least briefly.

3879
01:58:36,030 --> 01:58:38,370
That's just the reality
of heavyweight fights.

3880
01:58:38,371 --> 01:58:40,230
It's one of the reasons why
heavyweights are so exciting.

3881
01:58:40,510 --> 01:58:44,290
That's cause they can end a fight with
one punch and that can happen at two oh

3882
01:58:44,291 --> 01:58:49,190
five and that can happen in one 78 it's
even happened at one 25 I mean to meet

3883
01:58:49,191 --> 01:58:50,410
Trish Johnson knocked out.

3884
01:58:50,411 --> 01:58:53,200
Joseph Benevidez is one
of the best in the world,

3885
01:58:53,201 --> 01:58:53,591
period.

3886
01:58:53,591 --> 01:58:53,981
In any way.

3887
01:58:53,981 --> 01:58:55,030
Class with one punch.

3888
01:58:55,210 --> 01:58:56,890
He just caught him perfect
and knocked him out.

3889
01:58:57,550 --> 01:58:58,300
The whole,

3890
01:58:58,300 --> 01:59:01,270
the whole knockout thing
like it seems like there's,

3891
01:59:01,990 --> 01:59:04,810
it seems like UFC has changed a lot.

3892
01:59:05,440 --> 01:59:06,220
Right?

3893
01:59:06,220 --> 01:59:06,880
In what way?

3894
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:07,481
Well I don't know.

3895
01:59:07,481 --> 01:59:09,730
I feel like I watched
a card the other night.

3896
01:59:09,970 --> 01:59:14,970
I think it was the most finishes in the
history of cards cause I was Sydney.

3897
01:59:15,910 --> 01:59:16,361
Australia.

3898
01:59:16,361 --> 01:59:17,194
Yeah.

3899
01:59:17,260 --> 01:59:18,010
That happens.

3900
01:59:18,010 --> 01:59:18,870
That happens some sometimes.

3901
01:59:19,240 --> 01:59:19,600
I don't know.

3902
01:59:19,600 --> 01:59:20,051
I don't have,

3903
01:59:20,051 --> 01:59:20,884
the statistics are,

3904
01:59:20,920 --> 01:59:23,350
are more finishes happening
in general right now?

3905
01:59:23,870 --> 01:59:24,121
Well,

3906
01:59:24,121 --> 01:59:24,331
they're,

3907
01:59:24,331 --> 01:59:25,870
they're rewarded for finishing,

3908
01:59:25,920 --> 01:59:29,230
so people are encouraged to get
performance of the night bonuses.

3909
01:59:29,460 --> 01:59:31,120
Very financially beneficial to them.

3910
01:59:31,240 --> 01:59:34,120
But you'll also have a card where
every fight goes a decision.

3911
01:59:34,580 --> 01:59:34,841
You know,

3912
01:59:34,841 --> 01:59:37,210
you also have a card where
every fight goes to submission,

3913
01:59:37,211 --> 01:59:39,220
which is much rare but can happen.

3914
01:59:39,250 --> 01:59:39,880
Yeah,

3915
01:59:39,880 --> 01:59:41,710
I guess it's just hidden boilies yeah,

3916
01:59:41,740 --> 01:59:42,760
I guess it's just like,

3917
01:59:42,820 --> 01:59:46,900
it almost feels like a guy's career is
tied into his ability to knock out maybe

3918
01:59:46,901 --> 01:59:49,450
more so than being well rounded fighter.

3919
01:59:49,480 --> 01:59:50,313
Well,

3920
01:59:50,850 --> 01:59:52,720
like guys who are exciting get,

3921
01:59:52,721 --> 01:59:57,100
we'll get more fights than
guys who may be more skilled.

3922
01:59:58,600 --> 01:59:59,770
I don't know about all that.

3923
01:59:59,771 --> 02:00:00,820
I mean it kind of,

3924
02:00:00,821 --> 02:00:03,070
but ultimately the cream rises to the top,

3925
02:00:03,130 --> 02:00:04,930
the best guy to hold the full package.

3926
02:00:05,260 --> 02:00:05,981
The best guys.

3927
02:00:05,981 --> 02:00:06,570
When,

3928
02:00:06,570 --> 02:00:06,790
I mean,

3929
02:00:06,790 --> 02:00:07,330
yeah,

3930
02:00:07,330 --> 02:00:11,140
like say like say a guy like Rory
Mcdonald who was on the podcast yesterday.

3931
02:00:11,320 --> 02:00:11,501
Oh,

3932
02:00:11,501 --> 02:00:12,010
role.

3933
02:00:12,010 --> 02:00:14,370
Roy is not a guy who
had chases a knockout,

3934
02:00:14,380 --> 02:00:15,790
but he's knocked a bunch of guys out.

3935
02:00:16,060 --> 02:00:19,870
But he's just super skilled and
technical and he's undeniable.

3936
02:00:19,990 --> 02:00:20,201
I mean,

3937
02:00:20,201 --> 02:00:23,710
he's one of the top contenders
and eventually he's going
to get a shot at the,

3938
02:00:23,910 --> 02:00:28,750
but I heard him on an MMA podcast and
even he said that his most recent knockout

3939
02:00:28,751 --> 02:00:31,090
was what he needed to
cement the title shot.

3940
02:00:31,210 --> 02:00:32,320
What was a big win too?

3941
02:00:32,321 --> 02:00:36,040
He fought Terex Hafeni who's a former
Strikeforce welterweight champion and

3942
02:00:36,041 --> 02:00:36,874
destroyed him.

3943
02:00:37,200 --> 02:00:38,020
Beat his ass.

3944
02:00:38,020 --> 02:00:39,880
So it was a definitive,

3945
02:00:39,910 --> 02:00:40,730
exciting Vic.

3946
02:00:40,730 --> 02:00:41,563
That's what I mean.

3947
02:00:41,750 --> 02:00:42,790
That's what I mean is it's a,

3948
02:00:42,791 --> 02:00:43,810
it's a better story.

3949
02:00:44,140 --> 02:00:45,070
Travels farther.

3950
02:00:45,130 --> 02:00:45,970
What sells,

3951
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:46,241
you know,

3952
02:00:46,241 --> 02:00:46,821
it's a lot of it.

3953
02:00:46,821 --> 02:00:47,654
And what sells.

3954
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:49,660
Like there's so many
guys in that division,

3955
02:00:49,810 --> 02:00:51,010
Matt Brown,

3956
02:00:51,040 --> 02:00:52,270
Robbie Lawler,

3957
02:00:52,300 --> 02:00:53,051
Hector Lombard,

3958
02:00:53,051 --> 02:00:54,400
and these guys are fucking ferocious,

3959
02:00:54,640 --> 02:00:57,340
has so many ferocious
guys in that division.

3960
02:00:57,370 --> 02:00:57,521
It's,

3961
02:00:57,521 --> 02:00:58,480
you got to sell yourself.

3962
02:00:58,510 --> 02:01:01,390
So you would say you climb the ladder
faster if you're knocking guys out.

3963
02:01:01,960 --> 02:01:02,321
Well,

3964
02:01:02,321 --> 02:01:03,400
if you're exciting,

3965
02:01:03,430 --> 02:01:05,020
but you could be submissions.

3966
02:01:05,021 --> 02:01:05,201
You know,

3967
02:01:05,201 --> 02:01:07,960
Damien Maia climbed the ladder
fast by submitting people.

3968
02:01:08,130 --> 02:01:08,471
It's,

3969
02:01:08,471 --> 02:01:13,471
it really depends entirely on what the
routed and it also like who you beat.

3970
02:01:14,140 --> 02:01:14,381
You know,

3971
02:01:14,381 --> 02:01:17,830
if she'd go in there and you
beat a guy who's not that good,

3972
02:01:17,831 --> 02:01:18,700
but you knock them out,

3973
02:01:18,701 --> 02:01:21,400
that's not as impressive as if you go in
there and you knock out Anderson Silva.

3974
02:01:22,110 --> 02:01:24,850
It's just that Mcgregor deserves the hype.

3975
02:01:25,780 --> 02:01:27,220
Everybody deserves what they get.

3976
02:01:27,760 --> 02:01:28,540
So yes,

3977
02:01:28,540 --> 02:01:29,800
everybody deserves what they get.

3978
02:01:29,830 --> 02:01:31,510
Whether or not he's the best in the world,

3979
02:01:31,750 --> 02:01:32,740
that's to be determined,

3980
02:01:32,741 --> 02:01:34,210
but he gets people excited.

3981
02:01:34,330 --> 02:01:36,580
That's a big part of
what the sport is about.

3982
02:01:36,760 --> 02:01:39,100
When we were talking earlier
about charisma and teachers,

3983
02:01:39,410 --> 02:01:44,120
like teachers having the ability to
be excited about the subject matter,

3984
02:01:44,121 --> 02:01:47,120
and it makes people drawn
to them well in MMA,

3985
02:01:47,540 --> 02:01:50,870
the ability to get people excited
about watching you fight is,

3986
02:01:51,230 --> 02:01:52,730
it's an aspect of fighting.

3987
02:01:52,760 --> 02:01:53,000
It's,

3988
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:53,210
it's,

3989
02:01:53,210 --> 02:01:53,640
it's a,

3990
02:01:53,640 --> 02:01:57,230
it's a variable and you know
to say that Connor doesn't get,

3991
02:01:57,350 --> 02:01:58,670
why do you let them talk then?

3992
02:01:58,671 --> 02:02:00,320
How about we never left fighters talk,

3993
02:02:00,740 --> 02:02:01,011
you know,

3994
02:02:01,011 --> 02:02:02,600
how about we never do
post fight interviews.

3995
02:02:02,630 --> 02:02:07,010
You're obviously a part of the integrated
package of you want to follow a guy,

3996
02:02:07,011 --> 02:02:08,270
you want to know who he is.

3997
02:02:08,390 --> 02:02:11,090
And then there's some guys like
John Jones is a perfect example.

3998
02:02:11,360 --> 02:02:13,970
Jon Jones a spectacularly talented,

3999
02:02:14,120 --> 02:02:16,790
but people don't like him for some reason.

4000
02:02:16,791 --> 02:02:19,790
And I've speculated that some of it
might be racism because he's this young

4001
02:02:19,791 --> 02:02:20,690
cocky black guy.

4002
02:02:20,930 --> 02:02:22,970
But there's a lot of people that
disagree with me and they say no.

4003
02:02:22,971 --> 02:02:24,050
Like they think he's fake.

4004
02:02:24,260 --> 02:02:26,480
They think his personality
sucks or they think that,

4005
02:02:26,690 --> 02:02:26,901
you know,

4006
02:02:26,901 --> 02:02:28,250
he does too many stupid shit,

4007
02:02:28,420 --> 02:02:31,700
stupid things that are contrary to this
Christian image that he's trying to

4008
02:02:31,701 --> 02:02:32,480
sell.

4009
02:02:32,480 --> 02:02:33,620
And there's a lot of variables.

4010
02:02:33,621 --> 02:02:37,370
But the reality is Conor McGregor puts
more asses in seats than the number one

4011
02:02:37,371 --> 02:02:38,660
pound for pound fighter in the world.

4012
02:02:38,661 --> 02:02:39,710
And that's fucking crazy.

4013
02:02:39,711 --> 02:02:40,070
Yup.

4014
02:02:40,070 --> 02:02:41,870
John Jones is being fucking everybody,

4015
02:02:41,871 --> 02:02:42,320
man.

4016
02:02:42,320 --> 02:02:43,520
He beat Ryan Bader.

4017
02:02:43,521 --> 02:02:45,230
He put on my treated,

4018
02:02:45,530 --> 02:02:45,910
the automic,

4019
02:02:45,910 --> 02:02:46,743
cheated asleep.

4020
02:02:46,820 --> 02:02:51,470
He beat a gust of sin and the fucking
unbelievable war of attrition.

4021
02:02:51,590 --> 02:02:51,771
He,

4022
02:02:51,771 --> 02:02:51,951
I mean,

4023
02:02:51,951 --> 02:02:52,850
he's beating everybody.

4024
02:02:52,851 --> 02:02:53,541
They put in front of me,

4025
02:02:53,541 --> 02:02:54,680
submitted Vito Belfort.

4026
02:02:54,860 --> 02:02:56,090
You can go on and on and on.

4027
02:02:56,091 --> 02:02:58,670
His list of accomplishments
have been spectacular.

4028
02:02:58,940 --> 02:03:00,210
Conor knocked out Dustin Pour,

4029
02:03:00,211 --> 02:03:00,590
Yay,

4030
02:03:00,590 --> 02:03:01,423
that's his best fight.

4031
02:03:01,810 --> 02:03:02,380
You know,

4032
02:03:02,380 --> 02:03:05,540
knock on Diego Brandao could fighters,

4033
02:03:05,720 --> 02:03:06,500
but they're not,

4034
02:03:06,500 --> 02:03:07,370
there's not Josie,

4035
02:03:07,380 --> 02:03:08,600
although he's not destroying Josie,

4036
02:03:08,601 --> 02:03:09,590
although in the first round.

4037
02:03:09,920 --> 02:03:11,270
So it's like what?

4038
02:03:11,271 --> 02:03:16,220
What is it about here that if it moves
too far in that direction that it becomes

4039
02:03:16,520 --> 02:03:18,590
more of a show in less of a contest?

4040
02:03:18,610 --> 02:03:18,980
No,

4041
02:03:18,980 --> 02:03:20,840
because there's always a
guy like Cain Velasquez.

4042
02:03:20,841 --> 02:03:22,370
Cain Velasquez doesn't talk much.

4043
02:03:22,490 --> 02:03:23,630
Beats everybody's ass.

4044
02:03:24,050 --> 02:03:24,530
Right?

4045
02:03:24,530 --> 02:03:26,570
That's how you beat your rate at a time.

4046
02:03:26,590 --> 02:03:26,860
Yeah.

4047
02:03:26,860 --> 02:03:28,340
If Conor Mcgregor,

4048
02:03:28,520 --> 02:03:28,941
you know,

4049
02:03:28,941 --> 02:03:30,170
wasn't skilled,

4050
02:03:30,240 --> 02:03:31,580
he wouldn't be getting as much hype.

4051
02:03:31,820 --> 02:03:36,650
Part of what is hyped about him is that
he's the perfect combination of things.

4052
02:03:37,040 --> 02:03:41,660
He's an intelligent trash talker who's
also highly skilled and his results have

4053
02:03:41,661 --> 02:03:42,880
been pretty God damn oppressive.

4054
02:03:43,280 --> 02:03:46,940
Whereas Cain Cain is huge
just because he's awesome.

4055
02:03:47,240 --> 02:03:47,661
I mean,

4056
02:03:47,661 --> 02:03:48,494
do you even,

4057
02:03:48,580 --> 02:03:48,831
I mean,

4058
02:03:48,831 --> 02:03:53,390
no one can even recall one thing that
he said that's been like captivating,

4059
02:03:53,930 --> 02:03:58,820
but when he beats your ass for five
rounds is fucking unbelievable storm of

4060
02:03:58,821 --> 02:03:59,301
punches.

4061
02:03:59,301 --> 02:04:03,170
And kicks and knees and take downs
in this never ending gas tank.

4062
02:04:03,470 --> 02:04:04,950
That's what makes Kayne special.

4063
02:04:04,951 --> 02:04:07,760
What makes him special is his
fucking skill level period.

4064
02:04:08,030 --> 02:04:08,680
End of this cut.

4065
02:04:08,680 --> 02:04:09,530
Same with Mark Hunt.

4066
02:04:09,770 --> 02:04:13,430
No one's getting all fired up about
hunts personality and interviews.

4067
02:04:13,431 --> 02:04:15,530
You know me feels awkward on camera,

4068
02:04:15,830 --> 02:04:16,341
but man,

4069
02:04:16,341 --> 02:04:18,690
when he fucking launches a
left hook and shatters dudes,

4070
02:04:18,710 --> 02:04:20,210
jaws and sends him flying,

4071
02:04:20,360 --> 02:04:22,340
that's what people get
excited about works too.

4072
02:04:22,580 --> 02:04:23,211
I guess it's just,

4073
02:04:23,211 --> 02:04:28,211
I guess it's just interesting that how
the whole social social media structure

4074
02:04:30,260 --> 02:04:35,260
has in every facet increased is the
importance of how of your public behavior.

4075
02:04:37,110 --> 02:04:41,820
Once like once upon a time athletes that
was just not even something they had to

4076
02:04:41,821 --> 02:04:42,570
consider.

4077
02:04:42,570 --> 02:04:43,000
Right.

4078
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:43,500
You know,

4079
02:04:43,500 --> 02:04:46,380
and now you're not just
training at the gym,

4080
02:04:46,381 --> 02:04:51,381
you're training with the PR person who's
trying to help you get the most out of

4081
02:04:52,171 --> 02:04:53,004
every tweet.

4082
02:04:53,220 --> 02:04:58,220
What's also the difference between a
person like who the person actually is and

4083
02:05:00,961 --> 02:05:02,010
their public persona,

4084
02:05:02,011 --> 02:05:02,400
right?

4085
02:05:02,400 --> 02:05:03,233
That's eroded,

4086
02:05:03,510 --> 02:05:03,840
right?

4087
02:05:03,840 --> 02:05:05,490
You get to know who they really are.

4088
02:05:05,491 --> 02:05:05,641
Like,

4089
02:05:05,641 --> 02:05:06,150
if you've,

4090
02:05:06,150 --> 02:05:10,890
if someone makes some like
really offensive or really
ignorant tweets and they

4091
02:05:10,891 --> 02:05:11,461
put all like it,

4092
02:05:11,461 --> 02:05:11,941
you go,

4093
02:05:11,941 --> 02:05:14,160
oh well that guy has these thoughts.

4094
02:05:14,390 --> 02:05:14,650
You know,

4095
02:05:14,650 --> 02:05:17,550
like the guy from orange is the new black,

4096
02:05:17,640 --> 02:05:18,361
what is his name?

4097
02:05:18,361 --> 02:05:19,220
Jason Silva.

4098
02:05:19,221 --> 02:05:19,920
Is that his name?

4099
02:05:19,920 --> 02:05:20,490
The guy from,

4100
02:05:20,490 --> 02:05:21,360
Oh Silverman.

4101
02:05:21,390 --> 02:05:21,870
Silverman.

4102
02:05:21,870 --> 02:05:22,440
Yeah.

4103
02:05:22,440 --> 02:05:27,000
Like I read this article saying that he
was ruining the show for them because

4104
02:05:27,001 --> 02:05:28,500
his tweets are so stupid.

4105
02:05:29,430 --> 02:05:30,250
And uh,

4106
02:05:30,250 --> 02:05:32,370
I was reading as to love that headline.

4107
02:05:32,880 --> 02:05:33,960
They are really dumb.

4108
02:05:33,961 --> 02:05:34,794
His tweets are don't.

4109
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:35,640
Wow.

4110
02:05:35,880 --> 02:05:36,301
They really,

4111
02:05:36,301 --> 02:05:37,230
they are really dumb.

4112
02:05:37,231 --> 02:05:38,040
His tweets.

4113
02:05:38,040 --> 02:05:38,960
But it's family.

4114
02:05:38,961 --> 02:05:39,601
In what way?

4115
02:05:39,601 --> 02:05:41,580
Like she says stupid shit.

4116
02:05:41,850 --> 02:05:42,820
It's like wow,

4117
02:05:42,821 --> 02:05:43,561
you can pull them up.

4118
02:05:43,561 --> 02:05:44,394
But no,

4119
02:05:45,340 --> 02:05:48,060
I just think the offending
people very bright.

4120
02:05:48,140 --> 02:05:48,710
Wow.

4121
02:05:48,710 --> 02:05:49,130
They're,

4122
02:05:49,130 --> 02:05:49,980
they're goofy.

4123
02:05:50,110 --> 02:05:50,460
Alright.

4124
02:05:50,460 --> 02:05:51,720
Ignorant kind of tweets.

4125
02:05:51,750 --> 02:05:52,200
Okay.

4126
02:05:52,200 --> 02:05:52,951
I mean maybe he's not,

4127
02:05:52,951 --> 02:05:54,520
maybe it's just not put
a lot of effort into it.

4128
02:05:55,160 --> 02:05:55,350
You know,

4129
02:05:55,350 --> 02:05:59,160
sometimes people tweet shit and they just
write it down and expect it to be like

4130
02:05:59,161 --> 02:06:00,060
scrutinized.

4131
02:06:00,240 --> 02:06:01,770
And there's that possibility too,

4132
02:06:02,100 --> 02:06:02,311
you know?

4133
02:06:02,311 --> 02:06:07,311
Or maybe he's not aware of how goofy
142 they ask him to stop tweeting.

4134
02:06:07,620 --> 02:06:08,310
I don't know.

4135
02:06:08,310 --> 02:06:08,700
Oh,

4136
02:06:08,700 --> 02:06:12,600
I know there was a guy in ESPN that
actually there was a store that I tweeted

4137
02:06:12,601 --> 02:06:17,400
the other day that he got suspended off
Twitter because he was arguing about

4138
02:06:17,430 --> 02:06:18,450
evolution,

4139
02:06:19,140 --> 02:06:23,640
arguing for evolution with
some other baseball player.

4140
02:06:23,640 --> 02:06:27,300
And Espn denied that that was
the reason why he got removed.

4141
02:06:27,301 --> 02:06:30,420
But what at little fuck
else could it have been?

4142
02:06:30,540 --> 02:06:33,480
He was arguing with his former
athlete who was like nuts.

4143
02:06:33,540 --> 02:06:34,321
No believes the earth.

4144
02:06:34,321 --> 02:06:35,220
10,000 years old,

4145
02:06:35,221 --> 02:06:36,120
one of those motherfuckers.

4146
02:06:36,210 --> 02:06:36,990
Right.

4147
02:06:36,990 --> 02:06:39,630
And he got suspended.

4148
02:06:39,840 --> 02:06:44,840
Like the fact that ESPN can suspend
you from Twitter and ESPN says it has

4149
02:06:45,151 --> 02:06:46,530
nothing to do with that.

4150
02:06:46,650 --> 02:06:50,340
When you tell us what the fuck it out
do it because none of the shit that he

4151
02:06:50,341 --> 02:06:51,510
said is offensive.

4152
02:06:51,650 --> 02:06:51,990
Right.

4153
02:06:51,990 --> 02:06:54,390
He was talking with no swears,

4154
02:06:54,480 --> 02:06:55,500
no insults.

4155
02:06:55,530 --> 02:06:59,310
Talking about science and how important
science was talking about transitionary

4156
02:06:59,311 --> 02:06:59,881
fossils,

4157
02:06:59,881 --> 02:07:01,440
talking about the reality of evolution.

4158
02:07:01,441 --> 02:07:02,274
This is the evidence.

4159
02:07:02,640 --> 02:07:04,530
And they suspended him from Twitter.

4160
02:07:04,620 --> 02:07:08,370
So what else would cause them
to suspend him from Twitter?

4161
02:07:08,520 --> 02:07:13,080
What the fuck could you do outside of
tweeting that would cause you to be

4162
02:07:13,081 --> 02:07:14,250
suspended from Twitter?

4163
02:07:14,610 --> 02:07:18,240
And how the fuck does ESPN
suspended guy from Twitter,

4164
02:07:18,570 --> 02:07:19,290
not,

4165
02:07:19,290 --> 02:07:20,130
not uh,

4166
02:07:20,280 --> 02:07:21,720
a part of their marketing plan?

4167
02:07:21,900 --> 02:07:22,170
Well,

4168
02:07:22,170 --> 02:07:22,470
you know,

4169
02:07:22,470 --> 02:07:24,060
they're saying that they own you,

4170
02:07:24,450 --> 02:07:25,650
they own your thoughts,

4171
02:07:25,740 --> 02:07:27,360
they own your ability to express yourself.

4172
02:07:27,380 --> 02:07:28,130
Yes.

4173
02:07:28,130 --> 02:07:28,950
Do you,

4174
02:07:28,950 --> 02:07:32,310
there is a connection between the
sports fan in religion though.

4175
02:07:33,690 --> 02:07:38,070
How many thank God's coming out after a
fighter wins or someone wins the super

4176
02:07:38,071 --> 02:07:39,020
bowl or maybe,

4177
02:07:39,110 --> 02:07:43,240
but this guy was pretty clear about who's
wasn't saying that there was no god.

4178
02:07:43,510 --> 02:07:45,190
Oh he wasn't saying he was,

4179
02:07:45,310 --> 02:07:46,720
it wasn't anti religion,

4180
02:07:47,170 --> 02:07:49,330
Bollywood pro sign those,

4181
02:07:49,331 --> 02:07:52,750
those that disagree with the concept
of evolution or whoever it was he was

4182
02:07:52,751 --> 02:07:53,320
arguing with,

4183
02:07:53,320 --> 02:07:57,910
that's still a large percentage of the
public if that's really what they're

4184
02:07:57,911 --> 02:07:58,380
going for.

4185
02:07:58,380 --> 02:07:59,800
It obviously,

4186
02:07:59,950 --> 02:08:01,120
I mean obviously you're not,

4187
02:08:01,380 --> 02:08:02,250
yeah you are,

4188
02:08:02,260 --> 02:08:04,660
but shabby God damn at Espn,

4189
02:08:04,980 --> 02:08:05,260
right?

4190
02:08:05,260 --> 02:08:06,280
He's just fucking Christ.

4191
02:08:06,460 --> 02:08:09,850
I mean that's just like how many times
does it have to be explained over and

4192
02:08:09,851 --> 02:08:10,331
over and over?

4193
02:08:10,331 --> 02:08:12,040
How many biologists have to come on board?

4194
02:08:12,041 --> 02:08:15,170
How many times does evolution
have to be explained?

4195
02:08:15,171 --> 02:08:16,840
I don't know that they need to believe it.

4196
02:08:17,200 --> 02:08:20,260
I think that they're just more worried
about satisfying the audience and

4197
02:08:20,261 --> 02:08:21,094
audience.

4198
02:08:21,160 --> 02:08:24,640
A segment of the audience that they
might have walked out fuck ever.

4199
02:08:24,820 --> 02:08:29,820
It's just so depressing that a sports
network could actually have issue with a

4200
02:08:30,101 --> 02:08:31,600
guy who's talking about,

4201
02:08:32,290 --> 02:08:34,090
I agree with you and beyond that,

4202
02:08:34,120 --> 02:08:35,170
it's his Twitter account.

4203
02:08:35,200 --> 02:08:35,670
Exactly.

4204
02:08:35,670 --> 02:08:36,010
Yeah,

4205
02:08:36,010 --> 02:08:36,700
but it's not,

4206
02:08:36,700 --> 02:08:37,110
oh,

4207
02:08:37,110 --> 02:08:37,943
you if you,

4208
02:08:37,960 --> 02:08:38,800
I mean it is,

4209
02:08:39,550 --> 02:08:42,130
but if you work for ESPN
is not your Twitter,

4210
02:08:42,190 --> 02:08:43,120
you're their bitch.

4211
02:08:43,480 --> 02:08:44,313
You're their bitch.

4212
02:08:45,150 --> 02:08:45,760
And that's,

4213
02:08:45,760 --> 02:08:49,480
that's a common thing they tweet for
people that are on television shows.

4214
02:08:49,660 --> 02:08:50,650
When I was doing a show,

4215
02:08:50,651 --> 02:08:51,730
they asked me,

4216
02:08:51,790 --> 02:08:53,500
they wanted to take over my social media.

4217
02:08:53,560 --> 02:08:54,410
They'll fuck adding.

4218
02:08:54,411 --> 02:08:55,121
Yes they did.

4219
02:08:55,121 --> 02:08:56,470
And I told him to go fuck themselves.

4220
02:08:56,471 --> 02:08:56,611
Like,

4221
02:08:56,611 --> 02:08:58,990
are you out of your fucking
mind even asks you that.

4222
02:08:59,470 --> 02:09:00,420
I won't say no.

4223
02:09:00,421 --> 02:09:00,560
No,

4224
02:09:00,560 --> 02:09:01,181
not a name,

4225
02:09:01,181 --> 02:09:03,640
but like a company that I was working for,

4226
02:09:03,641 --> 02:09:06,090
a network that I was working
for that wanted to take over my,

4227
02:09:06,130 --> 02:09:07,420
they wanted a tweet for me and I said,

4228
02:09:07,421 --> 02:09:08,254
you can go fuck.

4229
02:09:08,410 --> 02:09:10,180
You can't tweet for me if you,

4230
02:09:10,450 --> 02:09:14,530
if you read a tweet is the only time the
tweets not from me is when it's an auto

4231
02:09:14,531 --> 02:09:15,140
upload,

4232
02:09:15,140 --> 02:09:17,560
a youtube video where
it says just uploaded,

4233
02:09:17,561 --> 02:09:17,741
blah,

4234
02:09:17,741 --> 02:09:17,891
blah,

4235
02:09:17,891 --> 02:09:18,041
blah,

4236
02:09:18,041 --> 02:09:18,191
blah,

4237
02:09:18,191 --> 02:09:18,550
blah.

4238
02:09:18,550 --> 02:09:20,770
That's not coming from my
fingers on the keyboard,

4239
02:09:20,771 --> 02:09:24,220
but it's coming directly from someone
who works for me who's only tweeting

4240
02:09:24,221 --> 02:09:27,390
something through a automatic top blue.

4241
02:09:27,450 --> 02:09:29,350
There's a little checkbox that says,

4242
02:09:29,410 --> 02:09:29,771
yes,

4243
02:09:29,771 --> 02:09:30,460
tweak this.

4244
02:09:30,460 --> 02:09:30,581
Yeah,

4245
02:09:30,581 --> 02:09:31,300
exactly.

4246
02:09:31,300 --> 02:09:32,081
And just to let everyone,

4247
02:09:32,081 --> 02:09:33,220
the other videos are getting uploaded.

4248
02:09:33,250 --> 02:09:34,240
It's not opinions,

4249
02:09:34,440 --> 02:09:35,530
it's not facts.

4250
02:09:35,531 --> 02:09:38,560
It's not interesting articles or
stories that I find fascinating.

4251
02:09:39,460 --> 02:09:40,390
It exposes though,

4252
02:09:40,391 --> 02:09:45,391
it exposes the whole a deficiency
of that traditional medium,

4253
02:09:47,470 --> 02:09:49,120
how they can just sort of dangle it.

4254
02:09:49,560 --> 02:09:50,111
You know what I mean?

4255
02:09:50,111 --> 02:09:52,360
How compliance is such a huge part of it.

4256
02:09:52,810 --> 02:09:55,030
Will you know what
happened with Joan Rivers,

4257
02:09:55,031 --> 02:09:55,864
right?

4258
02:09:56,440 --> 02:09:57,273
Oh Shit.

4259
02:09:57,280 --> 02:09:59,530
The endorsement after she was dead.

4260
02:09:59,531 --> 02:10:00,091
Yes,

4261
02:10:00,091 --> 02:10:01,480
it was an iPhone endorsement.

4262
02:10:01,520 --> 02:10:02,210
That's crazy.

4263
02:10:02,210 --> 02:10:05,350
Like what the fuck is daddy at all about?

4264
02:10:05,351 --> 02:10:05,831
Very,

4265
02:10:05,831 --> 02:10:06,664
very creepy.

4266
02:10:06,820 --> 02:10:07,690
Disgusting.

4267
02:10:07,691 --> 02:10:08,590
I saw that come up.

4268
02:10:11,350 --> 02:10:13,410
So that's one of those things are bad.

4269
02:10:13,480 --> 02:10:14,680
You don't realize,

4270
02:10:14,681 --> 02:10:16,030
you don't realize bad look,

4271
02:10:16,350 --> 02:10:17,500
choose or that I,

4272
02:10:17,560 --> 02:10:17,831
you know,

4273
02:10:17,831 --> 02:10:21,100
there's a thing called UFC fight
pass that allows you to watch fights.

4274
02:10:21,130 --> 02:10:21,760
I love it too.

4275
02:10:21,760 --> 02:10:22,840
And I was using it.

4276
02:10:22,870 --> 02:10:23,171
I'm like,

4277
02:10:23,171 --> 02:10:23,381
man,

4278
02:10:23,381 --> 02:10:24,570
five past fucking awesome.

4279
02:10:24,620 --> 02:10:25,420
I love this thing.

4280
02:10:25,420 --> 02:10:26,530
And I tweeted it because it was,

4281
02:10:26,531 --> 02:10:29,020
and people will use shill how
much they pay you for that.

4282
02:10:29,021 --> 02:10:29,950
Like zero,

4283
02:10:30,550 --> 02:10:31,060
zero.

4284
02:10:31,060 --> 02:10:31,570
Right.

4285
02:10:31,570 --> 02:10:32,560
You can't like anything.

4286
02:10:32,780 --> 02:10:32,940
Well,

4287
02:10:32,940 --> 02:10:34,550
I can't look anything as UFC related.

4288
02:10:34,551 --> 02:10:34,710
Yeah,

4289
02:10:34,710 --> 02:10:35,150
sure.

4290
02:10:35,150 --> 02:10:35,983
Yes.

4291
02:10:36,020 --> 02:10:36,650
Which is,

4292
02:10:36,650 --> 02:10:37,760
which is weird.

4293
02:10:37,910 --> 02:10:38,650
What's good?

4294
02:10:38,650 --> 02:10:39,351
This looks good.

4295
02:10:39,351 --> 02:10:39,591
Yeah,

4296
02:10:39,591 --> 02:10:39,691
yeah,

4297
02:10:39,691 --> 02:10:39,831
yeah.

4298
02:10:39,831 --> 02:10:42,860
Because people are
there checking up there.

4299
02:10:42,861 --> 02:10:43,400
They're there,

4300
02:10:43,400 --> 02:10:44,690
they're questioning things.

4301
02:10:44,720 --> 02:10:46,880
They're not just accepting
things for face value.

4302
02:10:46,881 --> 02:10:51,170
They're assuming that some fuckery is
around and even though they're wrong in

4303
02:10:51,171 --> 02:10:52,280
some circumstances,

4304
02:10:52,281 --> 02:10:54,440
I liked the fact that
there's some fantasy.

4305
02:10:54,610 --> 02:10:56,000
It's a bad investment for you.

4306
02:10:56,270 --> 02:10:57,290
For me personally,

4307
02:10:57,291 --> 02:10:58,124
yes.

4308
02:10:58,430 --> 02:10:58,611
No,

4309
02:10:58,611 --> 02:10:59,061
not really.

4310
02:10:59,061 --> 02:10:59,990
Cause I can talk about it.

4311
02:11:00,110 --> 02:11:00,380
No.

4312
02:11:00,380 --> 02:11:00,711
Oh No,

4313
02:11:00,711 --> 02:11:00,771
no,

4314
02:11:00,771 --> 02:11:01,040
no.

4315
02:11:01,040 --> 02:11:01,873
I'm not,

4316
02:11:02,030 --> 02:11:03,590
it's a bad investment for you.

4317
02:11:05,270 --> 02:11:05,670
What did I,

4318
02:11:05,670 --> 02:11:07,100
what did I mean to say by that?

4319
02:11:07,580 --> 02:11:09,290
Like you can,

4320
02:11:09,500 --> 02:11:12,080
you can go out there and talk
about something that you like.

4321
02:11:12,130 --> 02:11:12,430
Right.

4322
02:11:12,430 --> 02:11:16,610
But the second that somebody can point
out that maybe you were influenced in

4323
02:11:16,611 --> 02:11:17,840
some way than they have,

4324
02:11:17,870 --> 02:11:18,770
they have a case,

4325
02:11:18,860 --> 02:11:19,693
right?

4326
02:11:20,130 --> 02:11:20,331
And,

4327
02:11:20,331 --> 02:11:22,190
but if you allow,

4328
02:11:22,220 --> 02:11:23,660
if you allow that to happen,

4329
02:11:23,990 --> 02:11:24,321
right?

4330
02:11:24,321 --> 02:11:25,760
If you allow them to respond,

4331
02:11:25,761 --> 02:11:27,050
like do you respond back to them?

4332
02:11:27,530 --> 02:11:28,250
No.

4333
02:11:28,250 --> 02:11:28,610
No,

4334
02:11:28,610 --> 02:11:29,630
but on here maybe.

4335
02:11:29,700 --> 02:11:29,911
Yeah.

4336
02:11:29,911 --> 02:11:30,031
I mean,

4337
02:11:30,031 --> 02:11:30,271
I mean,

4338
02:11:30,271 --> 02:11:32,040
I'm saying it right now on Twitter.

4339
02:11:32,340 --> 02:11:33,870
If I did that all day,

4340
02:11:33,900 --> 02:11:37,320
that's the people that I'd be responding
to and that would make people gravitate

4341
02:11:37,321 --> 02:11:39,990
towards criticizing me so
that I would respond to them.

4342
02:11:40,830 --> 02:11:41,071
I mean,

4343
02:11:41,071 --> 02:11:42,240
that's the trolling trap,

4344
02:11:42,241 --> 02:11:42,451
right?

4345
02:11:42,451 --> 02:11:42,601
Yeah.

4346
02:11:42,601 --> 02:11:43,560
They criticize you.

4347
02:11:43,561 --> 02:11:45,900
So they get you to try to
react to them and they go,

4348
02:11:45,901 --> 02:11:46,290
hi,

4349
02:11:46,290 --> 02:11:46,951
you reacted.

4350
02:11:46,951 --> 02:11:47,784
I won.

4351
02:11:47,820 --> 02:11:48,061
I mean,

4352
02:11:48,061 --> 02:11:48,890
that's what it is.

4353
02:11:48,890 --> 02:11:49,530
A game.

4354
02:11:49,530 --> 02:11:49,711
Well,

4355
02:11:49,711 --> 02:11:50,460
it's,

4356
02:11:50,460 --> 02:11:53,400
and there's legitimate
criticism that's interesting.

4357
02:11:53,430 --> 02:11:55,790
You know that like you gotta
take into consideration.

4358
02:11:55,830 --> 02:11:59,460
There's people that have a perspective
that maybe even if you don't agree with,

4359
02:11:59,610 --> 02:12:03,270
you could see their point of view and
maybe adjust with what you are projecting

4360
02:12:03,390 --> 02:12:07,080
so that you're more clear with your
original intention where your or your,

4361
02:12:07,081 --> 02:12:08,190
your actual intention.

4362
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:10,140
There's people that get things wrong.

4363
02:12:10,530 --> 02:12:10,801
They,

4364
02:12:10,801 --> 02:12:11,101
you know,

4365
02:12:11,101 --> 02:12:12,390
and that's how small a fucking,

4366
02:12:12,960 --> 02:12:14,400
especially when it comes to Twitter,

4367
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,420
it's 140 characters and it's,

4368
02:12:17,470 --> 02:12:18,510
it's typing,

4369
02:12:18,540 --> 02:12:19,920
you're missing inflection.

4370
02:12:19,970 --> 02:12:21,330
He's a social cues.

4371
02:12:21,720 --> 02:12:21,900
Yeah.

4372
02:12:21,900 --> 02:12:24,360
There's so much that's missing context.

4373
02:12:24,480 --> 02:12:25,740
There's so much that's missing.

4374
02:12:25,870 --> 02:12:26,700
It's such an,

4375
02:12:26,700 --> 02:12:29,160
that's one of the issues
that I have with blogs.

4376
02:12:29,340 --> 02:12:32,610
Like you can write a bunch of
really harsh shit in a blog,

4377
02:12:32,850 --> 02:12:35,130
but while you're typing things out,

4378
02:12:35,280 --> 02:12:39,270
like a conversation is a real
way to communicate things.

4379
02:12:39,450 --> 02:12:41,610
And when you're typing things you can,

4380
02:12:41,790 --> 02:12:42,331
you know,

4381
02:12:42,331 --> 02:12:42,691
you're,

4382
02:12:42,691 --> 02:12:45,870
you're missing all sorts of social
cues and contexts you're missing.

4383
02:12:45,871 --> 02:12:47,790
Who is that person that's writing that?

4384
02:12:47,910 --> 02:12:51,180
I want to see your fucking stupid face
when you're writing this or when you're

4385
02:12:51,181 --> 02:12:52,014
saying this.

4386
02:12:52,110 --> 02:12:55,050
I want to see someone challenge you on
it and see what your response to the

4387
02:12:55,051 --> 02:12:55,884
challenges.

4388
02:12:55,980 --> 02:13:00,210
So I know who you are as a human and I
know whether or not to take your ideas

4389
02:13:00,211 --> 02:13:01,170
into consideration.

4390
02:13:01,200 --> 02:13:06,200
So then what's the consequence of people
communicating less this way and more

4391
02:13:06,600 --> 02:13:07,590
through their thumbs?

4392
02:13:08,070 --> 02:13:09,720
A lot of confusion for sure.

4393
02:13:09,840 --> 02:13:10,590
There's there's,

4394
02:13:10,590 --> 02:13:15,210
and also the ability for individuals to
draw the conclusions that reinforce what

4395
02:13:15,211 --> 02:13:16,050
they already think.

4396
02:13:16,350 --> 02:13:17,183
Yes.

4397
02:13:17,970 --> 02:13:18,870
Which is a problem.

4398
02:13:19,140 --> 02:13:22,590
It's definitely a problem and it allows
people to have careers that are social

4399
02:13:22,591 --> 02:13:23,424
retards,

4400
02:13:23,790 --> 02:13:28,790
allows them to express themselves in this
really distorted way and basing it on

4401
02:13:29,580 --> 02:13:34,230
their preconceived notions what this
person is and this is the result I would

4402
02:13:34,231 --> 02:13:34,921
like to draw.

4403
02:13:34,921 --> 02:13:35,910
So I will write a,

4404
02:13:35,911 --> 02:13:36,360
you know,

4405
02:13:36,360 --> 02:13:39,030
fucking thousand words on this.

4406
02:13:39,090 --> 02:13:39,923
Yes.

4407
02:13:40,110 --> 02:13:45,110
The Internet has allowed for individuals
to hide in a way that they were never

4408
02:13:45,841 --> 02:13:46,800
capable of before.

4409
02:13:46,801 --> 02:13:51,801
You just get around a group of like
minded individuals and jerk each other off

4410
02:13:52,291 --> 02:13:54,300
all day long and your gold.

4411
02:13:54,360 --> 02:13:54,930
Yes.

4412
02:13:54,930 --> 02:13:58,800
While there's a really interesting article
that I was reading about this guy who

4413
02:13:58,801 --> 02:14:03,210
was a part of this like skeptic community
and he disagreed with these other

4414
02:14:03,211 --> 02:14:06,510
people in the skeptic community and
this woman who's in this community had

4415
02:14:06,511 --> 02:14:10,710
written some blog criticizing him and
he said that he was going to be at this

4416
02:14:10,711 --> 02:14:13,470
certain conference who would love to
discuss it with her and she wrote,

4417
02:14:13,471 --> 02:14:15,260
do not approach me at this conference.

4418
02:14:15,260 --> 02:14:16,050
You're not say.

4419
02:14:16,050 --> 02:14:16,621
And he was like,

4420
02:14:16,621 --> 02:14:21,621
well you wrote 14 different
blogs mentioning me and I
can't even say hi to you.

4421
02:14:22,200 --> 02:14:23,670
And then another man said,

4422
02:14:23,671 --> 02:14:27,480
I am also going to be this conference
and if you come near me and talk to me,

4423
02:14:27,481 --> 02:14:31,110
I will have the conference
organizers are inherited called.

4424
02:14:31,170 --> 02:14:32,090
But it's like you're a vote,

4425
02:14:32,130 --> 02:14:35,790
you're a social retard
and you're admitting your
social retard because you're

4426
02:14:35,791 --> 02:14:37,410
willing to communicate about this person.

4427
02:14:37,411 --> 02:14:38,244
You willing to,

4428
02:14:38,290 --> 02:14:38,520
you know,

4429
02:14:38,520 --> 02:14:40,800
call them out or you know,

4430
02:14:40,801 --> 02:14:44,490
a fucking publicly shame them or whatever
you trying to do with your written

4431
02:14:44,491 --> 02:14:45,180
words.

4432
02:14:45,180 --> 02:14:50,010
But it's as far as like
actually communicating like
human beings were naturally

4433
02:14:50,011 --> 02:14:51,720
doing before the Internet.

4434
02:14:51,930 --> 02:14:53,010
You don't want any part of that,

4435
02:14:53,250 --> 02:14:53,461
right?

4436
02:14:53,461 --> 02:14:54,750
Like you want to be
able to criticize them,

4437
02:14:54,751 --> 02:14:55,320
but knock community,

4438
02:14:55,320 --> 02:14:59,520
you want to have more control over the
discourse than you should be allowed.

4439
02:14:59,550 --> 02:15:01,050
But you also want to define reality.

4440
02:15:01,470 --> 02:15:02,850
You don't want reality to find,

4441
02:15:02,851 --> 02:15:04,350
you don't want that person to
be in front of you and going,

4442
02:15:04,380 --> 02:15:05,213
I never said that.

4443
02:15:05,250 --> 02:15:05,461
Like,

4444
02:15:05,461 --> 02:15:06,271
that's not what I mean.

4445
02:15:06,271 --> 02:15:06,541
You know,

4446
02:15:06,541 --> 02:15:07,374
that's not what I mean.

4447
02:15:07,440 --> 02:15:11,010
What you're doing is reinforcing your
own narrative by distorting reality,

4448
02:15:12,900 --> 02:15:13,860
social anxiety,

4449
02:15:13,960 --> 02:15:14,370
uh,

4450
02:15:14,370 --> 02:15:17,700
high school all over again and I mean
that's what they're trying to avoid.

4451
02:15:17,701 --> 02:15:21,060
They're trying to avoid confrontation
by creating confrontation in,

4452
02:15:21,061 --> 02:15:23,850
in a literal way and in
a way where you know,

4453
02:15:23,851 --> 02:15:24,180
in,

4454
02:15:24,180 --> 02:15:24,421
in,

4455
02:15:24,421 --> 02:15:27,330
in a written word way and insulated way.

4456
02:15:27,390 --> 02:15:28,840
That's why then they put it on a blog.

4457
02:15:28,920 --> 02:15:29,753
Just the choir.

4458
02:15:29,820 --> 02:15:30,870
Anybody who disagrees.

4459
02:15:30,871 --> 02:15:31,704
Banham.

4460
02:15:31,860 --> 02:15:33,630
Anybody disagrees in the comment section,

4461
02:15:33,631 --> 02:15:37,200
Ban them and create this fucking
echo chamber and it's so unhealthy.

4462
02:15:37,201 --> 02:15:38,034
And that's,

4463
02:15:38,190 --> 02:15:38,401
I mean,

4464
02:15:38,401 --> 02:15:40,740
that's a lot of
progressive thinking today.

4465
02:15:40,820 --> 02:15:42,450
They'll call it progressive,

4466
02:15:42,780 --> 02:15:46,050
but it's like so closed off to
any alternative points of view,

4467
02:15:46,630 --> 02:15:47,190
you know,

4468
02:15:47,190 --> 02:15:47,730
I mean,

4469
02:15:47,730 --> 02:15:48,660
progressive,

4470
02:15:48,900 --> 02:15:50,460
conservative conservatism,

4471
02:15:50,461 --> 02:15:50,700
right?

4472
02:15:50,700 --> 02:15:51,061
It's like,

4473
02:15:51,061 --> 02:15:52,920
it's like a religion in a lot of ways.

4474
02:15:53,580 --> 02:15:54,510
In a lot of ways.

4475
02:15:54,511 --> 02:15:56,280
It's restrictive,

4476
02:15:56,610 --> 02:16:00,150
alternative and also very unkind.

4477
02:16:00,330 --> 02:16:00,571
You know,

4478
02:16:00,571 --> 02:16:03,330
one of the things about like
a lot of progressive culture,

4479
02:16:03,331 --> 02:16:05,400
today's is call out mentality.

4480
02:16:05,670 --> 02:16:06,260
And this,

4481
02:16:06,260 --> 02:16:06,700
you know,

4482
02:16:06,700 --> 02:16:08,610
there's no ability to,

4483
02:16:08,650 --> 02:16:09,060
uh,

4484
02:16:09,060 --> 02:16:09,893
shame.

4485
02:16:10,020 --> 02:16:11,190
I got something coming up,

4486
02:16:11,210 --> 02:16:11,750
uh,

4487
02:16:11,750 --> 02:16:12,210
uh,

4488
02:16:12,210 --> 02:16:13,980
video that I'm doing for charity,

4489
02:16:14,460 --> 02:16:14,970
uh,

4490
02:16:14,970 --> 02:16:16,110
this holiday season.

4491
02:16:16,111 --> 02:16:17,280
It's for UNICEF.

4492
02:16:17,281 --> 02:16:18,600
I don't know if I'm
allowed to talk about it,

4493
02:16:18,601 --> 02:16:18,991
but whatever.

4494
02:16:18,991 --> 02:16:19,620
I already,

4495
02:16:19,620 --> 02:16:21,250
I already did a,

4496
02:16:21,390 --> 02:16:22,800
and they approach me and they're like,

4497
02:16:22,801 --> 02:16:23,550
listen,

4498
02:16:23,550 --> 02:16:23,881
you know,

4499
02:16:23,881 --> 02:16:27,090
this time of year you're going to be
showing off all the latest and greatest

4500
02:16:27,091 --> 02:16:28,710
cool stuff people to buy.

4501
02:16:29,220 --> 02:16:29,650
Uh,

4502
02:16:29,650 --> 02:16:30,040
would you

4503
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:33,550
be willing to unbox our survival box?

4504
02:16:34,360 --> 02:16:35,560
They have a survival box,

4505
02:16:35,561 --> 02:16:40,561
which is like fundamental things that can
help people survive in shitty parts of

4506
02:16:40,631 --> 02:16:41,470
the world anyway,

4507
02:16:42,160 --> 02:16:43,120
and immediately asked her,

4508
02:16:43,121 --> 02:16:44,440
I said Yes to do it.

4509
02:16:45,040 --> 02:16:45,640
I thought,

4510
02:16:45,640 --> 02:16:46,390
oh fuck,

4511
02:16:46,390 --> 02:16:48,310
as UNICEF fucked anybody over.

4512
02:16:49,400 --> 02:16:51,760
Like what did I just open myself up to?

4513
02:16:52,240 --> 02:16:55,510
Because there's this concern
that like through association,

4514
02:16:55,511 --> 02:16:57,250
even if my intentions were the best,

4515
02:16:57,790 --> 02:16:59,650
that to the right person,

4516
02:16:59,651 --> 02:17:03,040
I may have just added just the right
amount of fuel for them to build an

4517
02:17:03,041 --> 02:17:04,630
identity around my decision.

4518
02:17:05,050 --> 02:17:05,890
That's so true,

4519
02:17:05,891 --> 02:17:06,191
right?

4520
02:17:06,191 --> 02:17:10,030
You have to be really careful when you
attach yourself to anyone in sanction.

4521
02:17:10,060 --> 02:17:10,601
Very,

4522
02:17:10,601 --> 02:17:11,411
very careful.

4523
02:17:11,411 --> 02:17:16,411
Then now I'm reading the Wikipedia in
UNICEF and it turns out that they collect,

4524
02:17:17,540 --> 02:17:18,130
uh,

4525
02:17:18,130 --> 02:17:19,210
in terms of revenue,

4526
02:17:19,211 --> 02:17:20,044
like,

4527
02:17:20,200 --> 02:17:21,520
like billions,

4528
02:17:21,521 --> 02:17:22,720
like they're huge.

4529
02:17:23,140 --> 02:17:25,390
But on the positive side,

4530
02:17:26,470 --> 02:17:31,240
a way to evaluate a charity is to see
how much money actually makes it to the

4531
02:17:31,270 --> 02:17:35,110
people that you're supposed to be helping
as opposed to like the administration,

4532
02:17:35,111 --> 02:17:38,590
like the salaries of the
people that work there.

4533
02:17:38,600 --> 02:17:41,350
And 92% gets out to people.

4534
02:17:41,410 --> 02:17:42,071
That's incredible.

4535
02:17:42,071 --> 02:17:42,910
Which is pretty good.

4536
02:17:42,940 --> 02:17:43,930
So it's incredible.

4537
02:17:43,931 --> 02:17:44,141
I mean,

4538
02:17:44,141 --> 02:17:45,640
that's probably the best I've ever heard.

4539
02:17:45,940 --> 02:17:46,460
Is it?

4540
02:17:46,460 --> 02:17:46,611
Yeah.

4541
02:17:46,611 --> 02:17:47,990
I don't think I've ever recall.

4542
02:17:48,050 --> 02:17:50,330
I don't recall anybody getting that much.

4543
02:17:50,500 --> 02:17:50,770
I've,

4544
02:17:50,770 --> 02:17:55,770
I've heard of horrible scenario where
zero or like 80% and 80% goes to

4545
02:17:56,271 --> 02:17:59,090
administrative costs and that's a common,

4546
02:17:59,091 --> 02:17:59,924
that's fairly common.

4547
02:18:00,260 --> 02:18:00,771
And they'll say,

4548
02:18:00,771 --> 02:18:00,951
well,

4549
02:18:00,951 --> 02:18:01,790
there's no other way,

4550
02:18:01,820 --> 02:18:02,590
you know,

4551
02:18:02,590 --> 02:18:02,950
you know,

4552
02:18:02,950 --> 02:18:03,890
there's no other way around it.

4553
02:18:03,891 --> 02:18:04,101
There's,

4554
02:18:04,101 --> 02:18:07,790
there's some pretty big
obscenity charities out there.

4555
02:18:07,910 --> 02:18:08,181
Yeah.

4556
02:18:08,181 --> 02:18:12,860
If you Google the percentage of
money that actually goes to charity,

4557
02:18:13,160 --> 02:18:16,810
there's some pretty harrowing numbers
when we've talked about on the podcast

4558
02:18:16,830 --> 02:18:19,370
have already listed all the railings.

4559
02:18:19,390 --> 02:18:20,030
Yeah.

4560
02:18:20,030 --> 02:18:21,620
Some of them are just disgusting.

4561
02:18:21,640 --> 02:18:25,340
This is a lot of fake fucking
charities and people get involved.

4562
02:18:25,341 --> 02:18:25,641
And I'm like,

4563
02:18:25,641 --> 02:18:26,361
do you remember when,

4564
02:18:26,361 --> 02:18:29,540
why clef John was running for
fucking president of Haiti?

4565
02:18:29,630 --> 02:18:30,170
No.

4566
02:18:30,170 --> 02:18:30,600
Yeah,

4567
02:18:30,600 --> 02:18:31,041
this is like,

4568
02:18:31,041 --> 02:18:36,041
that's like one of the big criticisms
was that how much of the money was going

4569
02:18:36,980 --> 02:18:38,750
like that he was trying
to generate for his,

4570
02:18:38,760 --> 02:18:39,410
um,

4571
02:18:39,410 --> 02:18:40,430
campaigns trying well,

4572
02:18:40,431 --> 02:18:41,280
he was trying to,

4573
02:18:41,281 --> 02:18:41,690
uh,

4574
02:18:41,690 --> 02:18:44,390
benefit Haiti after Haiti to
get hit by that big earthquake.

4575
02:18:45,080 --> 02:18:48,620
And there they found out that like a
very small percentage of the money was

4576
02:18:48,621 --> 02:18:50,870
actually going to elite illegal.

4577
02:18:51,020 --> 02:18:51,831
I don't know man.

4578
02:18:51,831 --> 02:18:54,830
I don't think there's actually
like a league goal number.

4579
02:18:55,020 --> 02:18:58,170
So you can start a charity
for a particular cause.

4580
02:18:58,171 --> 02:19:03,171
Have no interest in servicing that cause
keep all the money for yourself and

4581
02:19:03,571 --> 02:19:04,470
call it salary.

4582
02:19:04,950 --> 02:19:05,783
Yeah,

4583
02:19:05,910 --> 02:19:06,743
yeah,

4584
02:19:06,780 --> 02:19:07,613
yeah.

4585
02:19:07,940 --> 02:19:09,450
Like that's a huge fucking problem,

4586
02:19:09,451 --> 02:19:09,900
right?

4587
02:19:09,900 --> 02:19:10,231
Yes,

4588
02:19:10,231 --> 02:19:10,950
it should be,

4589
02:19:10,950 --> 02:19:13,770
but I think you can get
away with some shit man.

4590
02:19:14,010 --> 02:19:14,610
Apparently.

4591
02:19:14,610 --> 02:19:14,850
Yeah.

4592
02:19:14,850 --> 02:19:15,570
That seems to be,

4593
02:19:15,570 --> 02:19:16,650
that seems to be the case.

4594
02:19:16,740 --> 02:19:17,070
Yeah.

4595
02:19:17,070 --> 02:19:21,870
Quake gains little why club can
be found at hip hop artists.

4596
02:19:21,890 --> 02:19:22,210
Uh,

4597
02:19:22,210 --> 02:19:24,900
when was this quake in Haiti?

4598
02:19:25,200 --> 02:19:30,080
Little can be found of a hip hop
artist charity and there's um,

4599
02:19:31,100 --> 02:19:35,240
he was claiming that he and
dirty crucifixion after the
earthquake when he faced

4600
02:19:35,241 --> 02:19:38,720
questions about his charities financial
record and the ability to handle what

4601
02:19:38,721 --> 02:19:42,980
eventually amounted to
$16 million in donations.

4602
02:19:43,850 --> 02:19:45,050
That's so dark,

4603
02:19:45,051 --> 02:19:45,760
man.

4604
02:19:45,760 --> 02:19:46,593
Hmm.

4605
02:19:46,820 --> 02:19:47,480
Yeah.

4606
02:19:47,480 --> 02:19:49,870
I don't know like how
much actually went where,

4607
02:19:49,880 --> 02:19:50,511
what obviously,

4608
02:19:50,511 --> 02:19:51,111
I don't know.

4609
02:19:51,111 --> 02:19:56,111
He could be swindled by some dude that
he was attached to who ended up misusing

4610
02:19:56,421 --> 02:19:57,051
the funds.

4611
02:19:57,051 --> 02:19:57,411
And yeah,

4612
02:19:57,411 --> 02:19:58,101
it's possible.

4613
02:19:58,101 --> 02:20:01,700
But somebody in that chain of
command is a dark human being.

4614
02:20:01,940 --> 02:20:02,511
This is what it says.

4615
02:20:02,511 --> 02:20:06,740
The forensic audit audit examined
$3 million of the charities,

4616
02:20:06,800 --> 02:20:07,580
uh,

4617
02:20:07,580 --> 02:20:12,580
2005 to 2009 expenses and found (250)
600-0580 in illegitimate benefits to Mr

4618
02:20:15,471 --> 02:20:17,720
John and other,

4619
02:20:17,721 --> 02:20:22,721
a Yaley board and staff members as well
as improper or potentially improper

4620
02:20:22,941 --> 02:20:23,840
transactions.

4621
02:20:24,140 --> 02:20:29,140
These included $24,000 from Mr. Jones
show first services and $30,000 for a

4622
02:20:30,081 --> 02:20:34,790
private jet that transported Lindsay
Lohan from New Jersey to a benefit in

4623
02:20:34,791 --> 02:20:37,820
Chicago that raised only 66,000.

4624
02:20:38,960 --> 02:20:43,960
So 50% of the money that the benefit
raised went to Lindsay Lohan's jet.

4625
02:20:47,540 --> 02:20:48,373
Yeah,

4626
02:20:48,500 --> 02:20:48,830
I dunno.

4627
02:20:48,830 --> 02:20:52,940
The audit considered it appropriate
though for the charity to pay Mr John

4628
02:20:53,600 --> 02:20:58,600
$100,000 to perform at a fundraiser in
Monaco because that was his market rate.

4629
02:21:00,440 --> 02:21:03,740
So he did a fundraiser and during
the fundraiser that he organized,

4630
02:21:03,741 --> 02:21:08,741
he got $100,000 he had himself paid
$100,000 for a fucking fundraiser.

4631
02:21:11,540 --> 02:21:11,781
Well,

4632
02:21:11,781 --> 02:21:14,270
I'd like to be clear about
this upcoming units at video.

4633
02:21:14,271 --> 02:21:17,420
They did offer me money
to do it and I said,

4634
02:21:17,421 --> 02:21:18,254
hell no.

4635
02:21:18,410 --> 02:21:19,243
How about that?

4636
02:21:19,880 --> 02:21:23,000
It also found acceptable Yaley I guess.

4637
02:21:23,090 --> 02:21:28,090
What is the name of the benefit to spend
$125,114 on travel and other matters

4638
02:21:29,061 --> 02:21:34,061
related to a 60 minutes report on why
clefs mission to help the people of Haiti

4639
02:21:34,310 --> 02:21:35,750
and his personal success story.

4640
02:21:36,710 --> 02:21:38,390
So what's the fallout for this?

4641
02:21:38,780 --> 02:21:40,040
People think he's a piece of shit.

4642
02:21:40,280 --> 02:21:40,821
He's probably,

4643
02:21:40,821 --> 02:21:41,031
yeah,

4644
02:21:41,031 --> 02:21:42,110
I didn't even know about it.

4645
02:21:42,140 --> 02:21:42,973
Yeah.

4646
02:21:43,640 --> 02:21:44,473
Yeah.

4647
02:21:44,660 --> 02:21:45,740
I don't know.

4648
02:21:45,890 --> 02:21:46,730
I don't know man.

4649
02:21:47,390 --> 02:21:48,470
It's like if,

4650
02:21:48,490 --> 02:21:52,970
if he generates all this money and
more money goes to the charity,

4651
02:21:52,971 --> 02:21:56,210
then would have gone to the
charity without him doing it.

4652
02:21:56,570 --> 02:21:57,680
Is that a benefit?

4653
02:21:57,800 --> 02:21:59,750
Is that an inappropriate thing?

4654
02:22:00,260 --> 02:22:01,093
It's,

4655
02:22:02,690 --> 02:22:03,523
I don't know.

4656
02:22:03,650 --> 02:22:05,030
Think him getting paid a hundred grand,

4657
02:22:05,031 --> 02:22:06,390
do a fucking show when he's doing a chair.

4658
02:22:06,410 --> 02:22:06,591
I mean,

4659
02:22:06,591 --> 02:22:07,430
I've done fundraisers.

4660
02:22:07,431 --> 02:22:07,671
You know what?

4661
02:22:07,671 --> 02:22:08,990
I get paid zero.

4662
02:22:09,200 --> 02:22:10,840
I thought for 10 the whole idea,

4663
02:22:10,880 --> 02:22:11,930
every time I've done a fundraiser,

4664
02:22:11,931 --> 02:22:12,910
I've gotten paid zero months.

4665
02:22:12,911 --> 02:22:13,640
Yes,

4666
02:22:13,640 --> 02:22:15,360
he got a hundred grand doing a fundraiser.

4667
02:22:15,390 --> 02:22:17,390
That alone is fucking bullshit.

4668
02:22:18,100 --> 02:22:18,620
Yeah,

4669
02:22:18,620 --> 02:22:19,400
that's bullshit.

4670
02:22:19,400 --> 02:22:22,490
But that plays up the whole thing we were
talking about earlier about how people

4671
02:22:22,491 --> 02:22:26,070
want to attach themselves to something
and because that it's easy to prey on

4672
02:22:26,071 --> 02:22:26,970
those individuals.

4673
02:22:27,060 --> 02:22:27,990
I'm doing a charity,

4674
02:22:28,080 --> 02:22:28,861
I helped the poor.

4675
02:22:28,861 --> 02:22:30,510
Don't you want a piece of that?

4676
02:22:30,820 --> 02:22:31,653
Doesn't your,

4677
02:22:31,660 --> 02:22:34,440
that doesn't your psyche require that,

4678
02:22:34,530 --> 02:22:37,140
that great feeling that
comes through donation?

4679
02:22:37,980 --> 02:22:38,813
Definitely.

4680
02:22:38,940 --> 02:22:39,540
Definitely.

4681
02:22:39,540 --> 02:22:41,670
But the problem is with things like this,

4682
02:22:41,671 --> 02:22:44,550
I think people are fools if they don't
know that that's going to get out.

4683
02:22:45,240 --> 02:22:45,511
Oh,

4684
02:22:45,511 --> 02:22:49,440
you mean in his case you have to be a
fool to not know that someone's going to

4685
02:22:49,441 --> 02:22:53,820
find out you spent 30 grand on a fucking
private jet and fly Lindsay Lohan to do

4686
02:22:53,821 --> 02:22:54,654
a benefit.

4687
02:22:54,900 --> 02:22:55,880
Like how,

4688
02:22:55,980 --> 02:22:56,640
what?

4689
02:22:56,640 --> 02:22:57,220
What?

4690
02:22:57,220 --> 02:22:58,053
Lindsay Lohan.

4691
02:22:58,550 --> 02:22:59,383
Oh,

4692
02:22:59,430 --> 02:23:00,263
I'm confused.

4693
02:23:00,560 --> 02:23:02,550
You know you're not flying
Nelson Mandela somewhere.

4694
02:23:02,551 --> 02:23:02,851
All right.

4695
02:23:02,851 --> 02:23:03,241
Like what?

4696
02:23:03,241 --> 02:23:05,130
What kind of an impact is Lindsay Lohan,

4697
02:23:05,190 --> 02:23:08,730
a young pretty actress girl going to
have on your fucking charity for Haiti?

4698
02:23:08,880 --> 02:23:09,420
Right.

4699
02:23:09,420 --> 02:23:11,850
You're telling me that that money
wouldn't have been better spent on Haiti

4700
02:23:11,851 --> 02:23:12,421
itself?

4701
02:23:12,421 --> 02:23:13,620
Like that seems crazy.

4702
02:23:13,830 --> 02:23:14,340
Yeah.

4703
02:23:14,340 --> 02:23:14,431
I,

4704
02:23:14,431 --> 02:23:17,310
this is one of the benefits of the
distribution of information and things

4705
02:23:17,311 --> 02:23:20,980
opening up is like once upon a time if
some charities asking you for money and

4706
02:23:20,990 --> 02:23:21,270
you have,

4707
02:23:21,270 --> 02:23:22,020
you literally,

4708
02:23:22,020 --> 02:23:25,740
there's no way to even look for that
information or to to figure out where that

4709
02:23:25,741 --> 02:23:26,310
money's going.

4710
02:23:26,310 --> 02:23:27,000
So it's going to be,

4711
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:32,000
it's obviously harder now to to hide
those operations because in his case,

4712
02:23:32,320 --> 02:23:32,610
yeah.

4713
02:23:32,610 --> 02:23:36,640
Could you imagine what it would have
been like just decades ago just to,

4714
02:23:36,670 --> 02:23:38,700
to audit an organization.

4715
02:23:38,701 --> 02:23:39,800
It's a charitable organization.

4716
02:23:39,930 --> 02:23:43,650
How many charitable or
charitable organizations over
the years it had been total

4717
02:23:43,651 --> 02:23:47,070
frauds just bilking money
from people cashed too.

4718
02:23:47,250 --> 02:23:49,110
Is there a standard number?

4719
02:23:49,111 --> 02:23:53,880
I mean do you have to have
a certain percentage that
is like I dedicated towards

4720
02:23:53,881 --> 02:23:55,410
the charity mean to me personally,

4721
02:23:55,411 --> 02:23:57,240
just from like a logic perspective.

4722
02:23:57,241 --> 02:23:57,750
If it,

4723
02:23:57,750 --> 02:23:59,490
it would seem it would have to be half.

4724
02:23:59,670 --> 02:24:00,503
No.

4725
02:24:00,570 --> 02:24:01,050
Am I,

4726
02:24:01,050 --> 02:24:01,980
am I crazy?

4727
02:24:02,550 --> 02:24:03,780
Does that seem reasonable?

4728
02:24:05,010 --> 02:24:05,431
Yeah.

4729
02:24:05,431 --> 02:24:06,450
Well even that,

4730
02:24:06,480 --> 02:24:06,701
I mean,

4731
02:24:06,701 --> 02:24:07,620
the think a UNICEF,

4732
02:24:07,621 --> 02:24:10,910
UNICEF is fucking Brockton with 98%.

4733
02:24:10,960 --> 02:24:12,240
90 to 90%.

4734
02:24:12,360 --> 02:24:13,260
That's amazing.

4735
02:24:13,261 --> 02:24:18,180
Crazy thing is though I still did the
math on it and they're so huge that that

4736
02:24:18,181 --> 02:24:20,550
remaining 8% is still a big number.

4737
02:24:21,120 --> 02:24:21,781
The worst.

4738
02:24:21,781 --> 02:24:21,901
Uh,

4739
02:24:21,901 --> 02:24:25,830
there's a thing on
America's worst charities.

4740
02:24:25,831 --> 02:24:27,600
America's 50 worst charities.

4741
02:24:27,601 --> 02:24:32,250
Raykin nearly 1 billion for corporate
fundraising is very fitting this time of

4742
02:24:32,250 --> 02:24:32,820
year because these,

4743
02:24:32,820 --> 02:24:33,810
these vultures,

4744
02:24:33,870 --> 02:24:34,651
these vampires,

4745
02:24:34,651 --> 02:24:35,640
they're out right now.

4746
02:24:36,340 --> 02:24:37,650
This is when they're coming after you.

4747
02:24:37,980 --> 02:24:38,970
Above the law.

4748
02:24:38,971 --> 02:24:40,470
America's worst charities.

4749
02:24:40,550 --> 02:24:42,170
This kid's wish network,

4750
02:24:42,580 --> 02:24:43,310
uh,

4751
02:24:43,310 --> 02:24:44,540
millions of dollars.

4752
02:24:44,541 --> 02:24:47,780
They only give a set of 3 cents
on the dollar to helping kids.

4753
02:24:47,890 --> 02:24:50,390
That's the children's wish foundation.

4754
02:24:50,450 --> 02:24:51,260
Which network?

4755
02:24:51,260 --> 02:24:51,531
Oh,

4756
02:24:51,531 --> 02:24:51,831
okay.

4757
02:24:51,831 --> 02:24:54,680
They're like a rip off of the 2010.

4758
02:24:54,681 --> 02:24:57,440
They hired the crisis management woman.

4759
02:24:57,441 --> 02:24:58,310
I'm not going to give her name,

4760
02:24:58,311 --> 02:24:59,900
but that did the BP spill

4761
02:25:00,950 --> 02:25:03,540
for disgusting.

4762
02:25:04,140 --> 02:25:04,973
It's just,

4763
02:25:05,330 --> 02:25:05,820
you know,

4764
02:25:05,820 --> 02:25:09,780
there's so many vultures out there and
then so many people that they want to

4765
02:25:09,781 --> 02:25:12,600
make a lot of money being
involved in charities,

4766
02:25:12,750 --> 02:25:13,160
they're like,

4767
02:25:13,160 --> 02:25:13,320
ah,

4768
02:25:13,320 --> 02:25:13,770
you know,

4769
02:25:13,770 --> 02:25:15,330
I'm a CEO of a charity.

4770
02:25:15,331 --> 02:25:18,180
I should be making what a
CEO of a corporation we make.

4771
02:25:18,990 --> 02:25:19,950
Well that's like,

4772
02:25:20,160 --> 02:25:21,450
that's counterintuitive.

4773
02:25:21,451 --> 02:25:21,691
That's,

4774
02:25:21,691 --> 02:25:25,330
that goes against what everybody
thinks of when they think of charities.

4775
02:25:25,650 --> 02:25:27,790
I think of you doing it for charity,

4776
02:25:27,791 --> 02:25:28,630
like you're doing it.

4777
02:25:28,930 --> 02:25:31,690
This is like you're doing it to help.

4778
02:25:31,930 --> 02:25:33,550
How do you feel about charity in general?

4779
02:25:34,060 --> 02:25:35,950
So it's a great thing if it's real,

4780
02:25:36,430 --> 02:25:37,241
it's a great thing.

4781
02:25:37,241 --> 02:25:37,840
If it's a real,

4782
02:25:37,840 --> 02:25:41,650
I mean much of it could be a
problem to write too much charity.

4783
02:25:41,651 --> 02:25:42,484
In what way?

4784
02:25:43,120 --> 02:25:43,301
Well,

4785
02:25:43,301 --> 02:25:43,721
I don't know.

4786
02:25:43,721 --> 02:25:48,721
Everyone always talks about like aid going
to Africa and then war lords and shit

4787
02:25:49,450 --> 02:25:54,450
taking control of it and it only helping
them maintain their grip of on of power

4788
02:25:56,411 --> 02:25:57,550
and yeah,

4789
02:25:57,551 --> 02:25:59,110
that's kind of a different conversation.

4790
02:25:59,200 --> 02:26:00,190
I know it's not,

4791
02:26:00,191 --> 02:26:01,024
yeah,

4792
02:26:01,050 --> 02:26:03,100
like real charity is like Red Cross.

4793
02:26:03,101 --> 02:26:06,150
Like would people need
blankets and there's just some
sort of a disaster in that

4794
02:26:06,151 --> 02:26:06,461
come in.

4795
02:26:06,461 --> 02:26:07,730
They get food and they set up a,

4796
02:26:08,140 --> 02:26:08,501
you know,

4797
02:26:08,501 --> 02:26:11,860
a food kitchen for folks that
you mean like check charity here?

4798
02:26:11,940 --> 02:26:12,350
Yeah.

4799
02:26:12,350 --> 02:26:14,650
Local charity charity that you can audit.

4800
02:26:15,340 --> 02:26:16,173
Mm,

4801
02:26:16,180 --> 02:26:17,110
I see what you're saying.

4802
02:26:17,260 --> 02:26:20,920
Charity where you know it's going to be
like if you watch like a soup kitchen

4803
02:26:20,921 --> 02:26:21,251
line,

4804
02:26:21,251 --> 02:26:21,791
like okay,

4805
02:26:21,791 --> 02:26:22,481
that's real.

4806
02:26:22,481 --> 02:26:23,380
Like there's these people.

4807
02:26:24,220 --> 02:26:24,520
Yeah,

4808
02:26:24,520 --> 02:26:24,651
yeah,

4809
02:26:24,651 --> 02:26:24,821
yeah.

4810
02:26:24,821 --> 02:26:26,080
I want to contribute to that.

4811
02:26:26,650 --> 02:26:28,450
If you're sending money to,

4812
02:26:28,500 --> 02:26:28,900
you know,

4813
02:26:28,900 --> 02:26:32,710
fill in the blank some country
sending money to the Congo.

4814
02:26:32,950 --> 02:26:33,750
Well yeah,

4815
02:26:33,750 --> 02:26:37,360
the UNICEF one is to help people
there in Africa and that's the,

4816
02:26:37,420 --> 02:26:38,590
that's the weird part of it.

4817
02:26:39,100 --> 02:26:39,431
Okay.

4818
02:26:39,431 --> 02:26:41,890
So it's 92% is going to those people,

4819
02:26:41,891 --> 02:26:44,350
but how much of it actually goes?

4820
02:26:44,430 --> 02:26:45,263
Exactly.

4821
02:26:47,440 --> 02:26:48,273
People suck.

4822
02:26:49,030 --> 02:26:49,510
And that's,

4823
02:26:49,510 --> 02:26:53,240
I think that's the conclusion that we
could probably draw somewhere on the east.

4824
02:26:53,680 --> 02:26:56,440
Like whether it's from
Ferguson or this fucking CV,

4825
02:26:56,500 --> 02:26:59,650
CBC guy that's beating
chicks up or bill Cosby,

4826
02:26:59,651 --> 02:27:01,210
Julian people and raping them.

4827
02:27:01,240 --> 02:27:04,000
We have focused on a lot of negativity.

4828
02:27:04,001 --> 02:27:04,870
This podcast,

4829
02:27:05,470 --> 02:27:06,460
I feel like we could,

4830
02:27:06,490 --> 02:27:07,570
we could have done better.

4831
02:27:08,410 --> 02:27:09,610
Where's the optimism?

4832
02:27:09,730 --> 02:27:10,563
It's too late.

4833
02:27:11,170 --> 02:27:15,250
There's also the thing that
when you're aware of negativity,

4834
02:27:15,251 --> 02:27:15,821
it kind of,

4835
02:27:15,821 --> 02:27:17,110
when you expose it,

4836
02:27:17,140 --> 02:27:20,890
it makes it much more difficult for
that negativity prosper in the future.

4837
02:27:20,920 --> 02:27:22,300
I suppose you're correct about that.

4838
02:27:22,301 --> 02:27:22,900
Right,

4839
02:27:22,900 --> 02:27:26,410
so maybe in that case our
negativity was actually positivity.

4840
02:27:26,440 --> 02:27:27,860
I would like to look at it that way.

4841
02:27:28,090 --> 02:27:29,260
Seems convenient.

4842
02:27:30,430 --> 02:27:32,410
I would like to say that we did some good,

4843
02:27:32,890 --> 02:27:33,723
we had some,

4844
02:27:33,800 --> 02:27:34,870
some discussions.

4845
02:27:34,871 --> 02:27:37,420
We highlighted some gray areas.

4846
02:27:37,630 --> 02:27:38,463
It's true.

4847
02:27:38,770 --> 02:27:39,820
They need to be highlighted.

4848
02:27:40,030 --> 02:27:40,420
Yeah.

4849
02:27:40,420 --> 02:27:40,571
Yeah.

4850
02:27:40,571 --> 02:27:41,410
You need to be aware.

4851
02:27:41,590 --> 02:27:42,370
Well,

4852
02:27:42,370 --> 02:27:45,640
it's also what we're doing
is by doing a podcast,

4853
02:27:45,641 --> 02:27:50,641
by talking about stuff and by examining
these ideas as open a mind so we can,

4854
02:27:51,520 --> 02:27:51,970
you're,

4855
02:27:51,970 --> 02:27:55,270
you're exchanging information and that
information gets people to think about

4856
02:27:55,271 --> 02:27:59,800
these things and changes the perceptions
and the future of what these things

4857
02:27:59,801 --> 02:28:00,520
are.

4858
02:28:00,520 --> 02:28:00,761
You know,

4859
02:28:00,761 --> 02:28:05,470
like we didn't know that there was a
radio guy that likes beating the fuck out

4860
02:28:05,471 --> 02:28:06,070
of checks.

4861
02:28:06,070 --> 02:28:09,100
We didn't know until
that information got out.

4862
02:28:09,250 --> 02:28:14,230
That guy was a big time radio guy
in Canada for a long time until the

4863
02:28:14,231 --> 02:28:18,790
information got out that he was beating
people up or be on women up showing that

4864
02:28:18,840 --> 02:28:19,690
in that case he could,

4865
02:28:19,720 --> 02:28:19,990
you know,

4866
02:28:19,990 --> 02:28:22,130
the argument is that that

4867
02:28:22,130 --> 02:28:23,300
information getting us,

4868
02:28:23,330 --> 02:28:23,450
uh,

4869
02:28:23,450 --> 02:28:23,680
getting,

4870
02:28:23,680 --> 02:28:28,340
getting out and then us talking about it
is going to get to people who may have

4871
02:28:28,760 --> 02:28:30,290
sure being like him.

4872
02:28:30,600 --> 02:28:30,850
Right.

4873
02:28:30,850 --> 02:28:33,500
And maybe they would deter
them from doing the same thing,

4874
02:28:33,530 --> 02:28:34,220
I dunno.

4875
02:28:34,220 --> 02:28:34,431
Right.

4876
02:28:34,431 --> 02:28:34,880
And there's,

4877
02:28:34,880 --> 02:28:35,360
there's,

4878
02:28:35,360 --> 02:28:37,790
there's a certain amount
of positivity and justice.

4879
02:28:37,820 --> 02:28:38,480
Yes.

4880
02:28:38,480 --> 02:28:38,721
You know,

4881
02:28:38,721 --> 02:28:41,750
when someone's doing what
bill Cosby allegedly did,

4882
02:28:41,810 --> 02:28:42,650
drugging women,

4883
02:28:42,710 --> 02:28:44,210
what do you think will
happen with Bill Cosby?

4884
02:28:44,540 --> 02:28:45,530
That's a good question.

4885
02:28:45,531 --> 02:28:46,040
With this,

4886
02:28:46,040 --> 02:28:46,790
this guy,

4887
02:28:46,790 --> 02:28:47,690
this John,

4888
02:28:47,691 --> 02:28:48,650
whatever the fuck his name is,

4889
02:28:48,651 --> 02:28:49,550
Kashi going,

4890
02:28:49,551 --> 02:28:50,720
getting arrested,

4891
02:28:50,900 --> 02:28:51,550
going to jail.

4892
02:28:51,550 --> 02:28:52,040
Yeah.

4893
02:28:52,040 --> 02:28:56,780
I find it hard to believe that someone's
not gonna file charges against bill

4894
02:28:56,781 --> 02:28:57,410
Cosby.

4895
02:28:57,410 --> 02:28:58,070
Yup.

4896
02:28:58,070 --> 02:28:59,360
And it's just gathering steam.

4897
02:28:59,361 --> 02:28:59,810
Right?

4898
02:28:59,810 --> 02:28:59,961
Well,

4899
02:28:59,961 --> 02:29:02,270
it's just a matter of how
much evidence they have.

4900
02:29:02,280 --> 02:29:04,910
How much ice or the
issue right now is the,

4901
02:29:05,550 --> 02:29:07,190
there is a restriction.

4902
02:29:07,430 --> 02:29:07,971
What is it?

4903
02:29:07,971 --> 02:29:09,170
The Statute of limitation?

4904
02:29:09,170 --> 02:29:09,770
Yeah.

4905
02:29:09,770 --> 02:29:09,951
Oh,

4906
02:29:09,951 --> 02:29:14,270
the age that the crime was
more than 25 years ago,

4907
02:29:14,330 --> 02:29:14,631
right?

4908
02:29:14,631 --> 02:29:15,464
Am I right about that?

4909
02:29:15,800 --> 02:29:17,660
25 I don't know what the number is.

4910
02:29:17,750 --> 02:29:18,261
That's tricky.

4911
02:29:18,261 --> 02:29:19,940
When you're dealing with
a guy that's that old too,

4912
02:29:19,941 --> 02:29:21,500
like he probably doesn't fuck anymore.

4913
02:29:21,580 --> 02:29:22,413
You see?

4914
02:29:22,950 --> 02:29:23,783
Right.

4915
02:29:23,840 --> 02:29:25,090
I mean it has to take the agro,

4916
02:29:25,110 --> 02:29:25,700
rape,

4917
02:29:25,700 --> 02:29:26,181
whatever.

4918
02:29:26,181 --> 02:29:27,530
He'd go way out of his way to rape me.

4919
02:29:27,910 --> 02:29:29,150
You mean he's got the,

4920
02:29:29,360 --> 02:29:30,270
he's got the ingredient.

4921
02:29:30,320 --> 02:29:31,020
He's got the ingrained,

4922
02:29:31,020 --> 02:29:33,020
he's taking the right vitamins probably.

4923
02:29:33,530 --> 02:29:36,050
Did you see the Associated Press thing?

4924
02:29:36,180 --> 02:29:37,030
Yes.

4925
02:29:37,680 --> 02:29:40,550
That little clip there was that evil.

4926
02:29:40,610 --> 02:29:40,971
Ooh,

4927
02:29:40,971 --> 02:29:41,804
scary.

4928
02:29:41,990 --> 02:29:43,300
The way he responded to it,

4929
02:29:43,301 --> 02:29:43,760
it was like,

4930
02:29:43,760 --> 02:29:48,760
we don't discuss these things and
I was relying on your integrity.

4931
02:29:49,190 --> 02:29:49,960
Is that evil?

4932
02:29:49,960 --> 02:29:50,793
Pure evil.

4933
02:29:52,670 --> 02:29:53,870
There's a lot going on there,

4934
02:29:53,871 --> 02:29:54,081
man.

4935
02:29:54,081 --> 02:29:54,501
First of all,

4936
02:29:54,501 --> 02:29:57,140
it's this elite royalty attitude.

4937
02:29:57,320 --> 02:29:57,741
First of all,

4938
02:29:57,741 --> 02:29:59,000
he gave them the royal.

4939
02:29:59,300 --> 02:30:02,000
We do not respond like that's amazing,

4940
02:30:02,010 --> 02:30:02,843
right?

4941
02:30:03,110 --> 02:30:04,130
I'm talking to you,

4942
02:30:04,131 --> 02:30:04,551
man.

4943
02:30:04,551 --> 02:30:04,910
That's it.

4944
02:30:04,910 --> 02:30:05,960
That's a sociopath.

4945
02:30:06,290 --> 02:30:10,400
We means we means that he
views himself as a character,

4946
02:30:10,401 --> 02:30:11,234
right?

4947
02:30:11,300 --> 02:30:12,140
Isn't that what that means?

4948
02:30:12,141 --> 02:30:12,530
What does it mean?

4949
02:30:12,530 --> 02:30:14,090
We means there's more than one of him.

4950
02:30:14,150 --> 02:30:14,361
Yeah.

4951
02:30:14,361 --> 02:30:15,260
What does that mean?

4952
02:30:15,890 --> 02:30:19,640
We the organization known as Bill
Cosby artist known as bill Cosby.

4953
02:30:19,641 --> 02:30:19,880
Yes.

4954
02:30:19,880 --> 02:30:21,110
Representative of the artist,

4955
02:30:21,260 --> 02:30:22,730
the real version and the persona.

4956
02:30:22,731 --> 02:30:23,331
He's in weeding.

4957
02:30:23,331 --> 02:30:24,200
There's two versions.

4958
02:30:24,260 --> 02:30:25,640
I have a team behind me.

4959
02:30:25,641 --> 02:30:29,270
We do not yet respond and
he kept saying integrity.

4960
02:30:29,271 --> 02:30:29,931
In this weird world,

4961
02:30:29,931 --> 02:30:34,931
I'll rely on your integrity and I
relied on your integrity to not really,

4962
02:30:35,450 --> 02:30:37,580
data always kills me.

4963
02:30:38,450 --> 02:30:42,590
What I always think about whenever I
see any shit like that is how would I

4964
02:30:42,591 --> 02:30:45,110
respond had I not done it right.

4965
02:30:45,410 --> 02:30:46,070
Exactly.

4966
02:30:46,070 --> 02:30:47,150
And I always think I'd say,

4967
02:30:47,330 --> 02:30:47,621
listen,

4968
02:30:47,621 --> 02:30:48,910
get the fuck off my case.

4969
02:30:49,890 --> 02:30:52,130
Half speed didn't do it these days.

4970
02:30:52,220 --> 02:30:54,680
I feel like I'd be on
that stand or whatever.

4971
02:30:54,700 --> 02:30:55,240
Yes.

4972
02:30:55,240 --> 02:30:59,210
And I would not stop saying
that this was not me.

4973
02:30:59,240 --> 02:30:59,721
Exactly,

4974
02:30:59,721 --> 02:31:01,130
but yet you never see that.

4975
02:31:01,160 --> 02:31:01,993
Exactly.

4976
02:31:02,090 --> 02:31:04,790
Why the fuck do you never
see that they're guilty?

4977
02:31:04,791 --> 02:31:05,624
Probably.

4978
02:31:05,750 --> 02:31:06,880
I mean if you have to speculate,

4979
02:31:06,990 --> 02:31:07,400
honestly,

4980
02:31:07,400 --> 02:31:08,233
I'm just guessing.

4981
02:31:08,540 --> 02:31:10,040
But if I had to guess when,

4982
02:31:10,280 --> 02:31:10,610
look,

4983
02:31:10,610 --> 02:31:11,900
if someone came to you and said,

4984
02:31:11,901 --> 02:31:12,350
Louis,

4985
02:31:12,350 --> 02:31:16,370
I know that what you were doing is you
were a duck taping duties and fucking

4986
02:31:16,371 --> 02:31:16,940
their mouth.

4987
02:31:16,940 --> 02:31:17,271
What?

4988
02:31:17,271 --> 02:31:18,104
After you drug them,

4989
02:31:18,110 --> 02:31:18,531
you'd be like,

4990
02:31:18,531 --> 02:31:18,881
no,

4991
02:31:18,881 --> 02:31:19,714
I wife,

4992
02:31:20,760 --> 02:31:22,590
I didn't rape anybody in the mouth.

4993
02:31:23,850 --> 02:31:24,820
You can't just can't.

4994
02:31:24,890 --> 02:31:26,400
You can't fake that Reno.

4995
02:31:26,630 --> 02:31:27,140
No,

4996
02:31:27,140 --> 02:31:27,973
no.

4997
02:31:28,300 --> 02:31:32,650
The minute it starts to be labored
and it starts to be contrived,

4998
02:31:33,010 --> 02:31:35,620
you have to immediately say
what's the need for the show.

4999
02:31:35,820 --> 02:31:36,391
Exactly.

5000
02:31:36,391 --> 02:31:37,230
And there's also,

5001
02:31:37,320 --> 02:31:42,000
there's such a large number
of people that he harmed.

5002
02:31:42,660 --> 02:31:43,171
It's not like,

5003
02:31:43,171 --> 02:31:45,390
which one Cosby really?

5004
02:31:45,540 --> 02:31:45,751
Yeah,

5005
02:31:45,751 --> 02:31:47,100
there's like 17 women now.

5006
02:31:47,600 --> 02:31:49,410
17 oh yeah.

5007
02:31:49,440 --> 02:31:50,273
Oh Wow.

5008
02:31:50,310 --> 02:31:51,630
I not caught up on him.

5009
02:31:51,631 --> 02:31:53,010
17 yeah.

5010
02:31:53,130 --> 02:31:53,580
Yeah.

5011
02:31:53,580 --> 02:31:54,450
There's a lot.

5012
02:31:54,520 --> 02:31:55,010
Wow.

5013
02:31:55,010 --> 02:31:55,780
There's a lot of,

5014
02:31:55,780 --> 02:31:57,390
and more apparently are coming forth.

5015
02:31:57,760 --> 02:31:58,080
We'll do,

5016
02:31:58,080 --> 02:32:01,260
you know what they're saying is
he was doing this for decades.

5017
02:32:01,440 --> 02:32:01,950
Yeah.

5018
02:32:01,950 --> 02:32:02,820
He had a system.

5019
02:32:04,230 --> 02:32:06,150
I have three fucking donors to,

5020
02:32:06,330 --> 02:32:08,220
and even if I didn't have a mom,

5021
02:32:08,250 --> 02:32:08,461
you know,

5022
02:32:08,461 --> 02:32:09,480
you've had no daughters.

5023
02:32:09,481 --> 02:32:10,650
I love a lot of women.

5024
02:32:10,680 --> 02:32:11,071
You know,

5025
02:32:11,071 --> 02:32:13,290
I love a lot of humans
that happened in a female.

5026
02:32:13,440 --> 02:32:17,100
The idea that someone can do that and
that one of the people that I care about

5027
02:32:17,101 --> 02:32:19,020
and love could somehow or another,

5028
02:32:19,021 --> 02:32:19,890
how would you react?

5029
02:32:21,540 --> 02:32:22,410
I don't want to say,

5030
02:32:22,680 --> 02:32:23,513
you know,

5031
02:32:23,700 --> 02:32:25,560
it would be finding out where he was,

5032
02:32:25,590 --> 02:32:27,660
if I knew where he was physically,

5033
02:32:27,990 --> 02:32:29,250
if I knew where he was physically.

5034
02:32:29,251 --> 02:32:30,420
And he did that to one of my daughters.

5035
02:32:30,421 --> 02:32:30,930
Yes.

5036
02:32:30,930 --> 02:32:32,340
I probably be doing some jail time.

5037
02:32:32,640 --> 02:32:36,330
He would be in some sort of a
full body cast at a young age.

5038
02:32:36,360 --> 02:32:38,700
I saw the movie a time to kill.

5039
02:32:38,940 --> 02:32:39,770
I don't know if you've seen it.

5040
02:32:39,770 --> 02:32:40,190
Which,

5041
02:32:40,190 --> 02:32:41,670
who's in the Matthew mcconaughey?

5042
02:32:41,671 --> 02:32:43,790
It's before he started doing romcoms.

5043
02:32:43,800 --> 02:32:43,900
Yeah.

5044
02:32:43,900 --> 02:32:45,130
And sold his soul to the devil.

5045
02:32:46,230 --> 02:32:47,380
He was in the aids movie.

5046
02:32:47,440 --> 02:32:48,273
Um,

5047
02:32:48,280 --> 02:32:48,560
yeah.

5048
02:32:48,560 --> 02:32:48,801
He's,

5049
02:32:48,801 --> 02:32:49,511
he know now.

5050
02:32:49,511 --> 02:32:50,410
He's a bad ass.

5051
02:32:50,440 --> 02:32:51,890
He was mad Mike or Magic Mike.

5052
02:32:52,360 --> 02:32:52,511
Oh,

5053
02:32:52,511 --> 02:32:54,220
you're going back to
take a Channing Tatum.

5054
02:32:54,221 --> 02:32:54,760
No,

5055
02:32:54,760 --> 02:32:56,850
wasn't he in it to Macada
he was in there toe.

5056
02:32:56,860 --> 02:32:57,870
Maybe magic white.

5057
02:32:58,000 --> 02:32:59,890
I don't expose myself
to that kind of thing.

5058
02:33:00,570 --> 02:33:01,170
But then he,

5059
02:33:01,170 --> 02:33:02,140
but he recently did.

5060
02:33:02,141 --> 02:33:03,040
True detective,

5061
02:33:03,130 --> 02:33:04,300
which did you watch?

5062
02:33:04,301 --> 02:33:05,134
True detectives.

5063
02:33:05,140 --> 02:33:05,620
Right.

5064
02:33:05,620 --> 02:33:06,170
Wow,

5065
02:33:06,170 --> 02:33:06,821
that's fucking great.

5066
02:33:06,821 --> 02:33:07,571
That's the next level.

5067
02:33:07,571 --> 02:33:08,380
But anyway,

5068
02:33:08,380 --> 02:33:09,430
I saw a time to kill it.

5069
02:33:09,431 --> 02:33:12,580
A young enough age that you had
a drastic impact on my life,

5070
02:33:12,581 --> 02:33:14,100
which the premise of that movie,

5071
02:33:14,750 --> 02:33:15,500
Samuel Jackson,

5072
02:33:15,500 --> 02:33:16,333
do you remember this?

5073
02:33:16,430 --> 02:33:17,263
Yeah.

5074
02:33:17,580 --> 02:33:18,413
You remember the premise?

5075
02:33:18,770 --> 02:33:19,280
Barely.

5076
02:33:19,280 --> 02:33:19,581
Oh,

5077
02:33:19,581 --> 02:33:19,911
okay.

5078
02:33:19,911 --> 02:33:20,960
So early on,

5079
02:33:20,990 --> 02:33:21,590
um,

5080
02:33:21,590 --> 02:33:21,860
uh,

5081
02:33:21,860 --> 02:33:22,541
early nineties,

5082
02:33:22,541 --> 02:33:25,100
or black girl gets raped
by a bunch of hillbillies.

5083
02:33:26,290 --> 02:33:27,140
Did they kill her?

5084
02:33:27,860 --> 02:33:28,693
Yes.

5085
02:33:28,850 --> 02:33:29,683
Or they might,

5086
02:33:30,410 --> 02:33:31,080
they killed her.

5087
02:33:31,080 --> 02:33:32,870
They damaged irreparably.

5088
02:33:32,871 --> 02:33:35,390
She would never have kids
were raped her that badly.

5089
02:33:35,750 --> 02:33:37,670
And as you might've been
eight or nine in the movie,

5090
02:33:37,671 --> 02:33:38,630
I can't remember.

5091
02:33:39,500 --> 02:33:39,951
And,

5092
02:33:39,951 --> 02:33:40,784
uh,

5093
02:33:41,120 --> 02:33:41,471
and the,

5094
02:33:41,471 --> 02:33:42,304
the father,

5095
02:33:42,770 --> 02:33:43,510
uh,

5096
02:33:43,510 --> 02:33:43,730
uh,

5097
02:33:43,730 --> 02:33:44,563
murders,

5098
02:33:45,020 --> 02:33:47,360
murders of the dudes who
did it and he kills him.

5099
02:33:47,450 --> 02:33:48,110
Right.

5100
02:33:48,110 --> 02:33:48,943
And,

5101
02:33:49,060 --> 02:33:49,590
uh,

5102
02:33:49,590 --> 02:33:50,421
mcconaughey's character.

5103
02:33:50,421 --> 02:33:54,830
The lawyer is arguing that that was just,

5104
02:33:54,950 --> 02:33:55,640
Yup.

5105
02:33:55,640 --> 02:33:56,060
Yeah.

5106
02:33:56,060 --> 02:33:56,360
Well,

5107
02:33:56,360 --> 02:33:57,320
remember that guy that,

5108
02:33:57,321 --> 02:33:58,040
um,

5109
02:33:58,040 --> 02:34:01,820
there was a martial arts instructor
that molested his kid and the guy got

5110
02:34:01,821 --> 02:34:03,650
arrested and they were taking the guy,

5111
02:34:03,651 --> 02:34:05,030
the cops were taking the guy,

5112
02:34:05,360 --> 02:34:05,831
um,

5113
02:34:05,831 --> 02:34:07,310
through an airport or something like that,

5114
02:34:07,311 --> 02:34:08,270
and the guy jumped out.

5115
02:34:08,280 --> 02:34:09,170
You shot him in the head?

5116
02:34:09,200 --> 02:34:09,561
Yes.

5117
02:34:09,561 --> 02:34:10,071
And got off.

5118
02:34:10,071 --> 02:34:10,610
Got Off.

5119
02:34:10,610 --> 02:34:11,443
Yes.

5120
02:34:11,510 --> 02:34:13,350
I do recall that there's,

5121
02:34:13,490 --> 02:34:14,420
you know what man?

5122
02:34:14,421 --> 02:34:17,890
I mean there's certain shit that can't do

5123
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:20,020
what any part of you though,

5124
02:34:20,080 --> 02:34:20,913
worry.

5125
02:34:22,540 --> 02:34:24,040
This is a very difficult question.

5126
02:34:24,400 --> 02:34:27,820
Would any part of you worry that the
story you were getting from your daughter

5127
02:34:27,821 --> 02:34:31,570
would be untrue if 17 other
people said the same story?

5128
02:34:31,630 --> 02:34:32,440
Time to die.

5129
02:34:32,440 --> 02:34:34,120
It's time to break Cosby's arms.

5130
02:34:35,680 --> 02:34:36,220
Both of them.

5131
02:34:36,220 --> 02:34:36,751
Wow.

5132
02:34:36,751 --> 02:34:37,600
And he places,

5133
02:34:37,750 --> 02:34:38,140
well,

5134
02:34:38,140 --> 02:34:39,310
there's 17 people.

5135
02:34:39,580 --> 02:34:40,720
I think if I,

5136
02:34:40,750 --> 02:34:41,740
if that was my daughter,

5137
02:34:41,741 --> 02:34:44,110
I would be so consumed with anger.

5138
02:34:44,140 --> 02:34:45,940
I don't know if I'd be
able to contain myself,

5139
02:34:46,390 --> 02:34:50,740
I would have to actively keep from being
anywhere near him because if I fucked

5140
02:34:50,741 --> 02:34:51,574
up,

5141
02:34:51,820 --> 02:34:55,930
and I mean there's something about
victimizing people that's horrific.

5142
02:34:55,960 --> 02:34:59,820
I know something about victimizing a
woman that's particularly horrific and,

5143
02:34:59,821 --> 02:35:03,580
and victimize a woman by drugging her
and then doing what you want to do with

5144
02:35:03,581 --> 02:35:04,061
her body,

5145
02:35:04,061 --> 02:35:05,530
like taking away their humanity.

5146
02:35:05,531 --> 02:35:06,364
They become like,

5147
02:35:06,580 --> 02:35:09,580
they become something that you use
like a fucking human fleshlight.

5148
02:35:09,850 --> 02:35:11,350
If they're out cold,

5149
02:35:11,351 --> 02:35:12,850
you draw them and then you,

5150
02:35:13,090 --> 02:35:13,990
you fucked them.

5151
02:35:13,991 --> 02:35:14,740
And like who?

5152
02:35:14,740 --> 02:35:15,573
I mean,

5153
02:35:15,850 --> 02:35:17,530
the real question is right.

5154
02:35:17,650 --> 02:35:22,650
Like the only thing worse you could do
is beat them up or worse you could do is

5155
02:35:24,821 --> 02:35:26,980
like physically hurt them.

5156
02:35:27,040 --> 02:35:28,960
Irreparably does the only thing worse,

5157
02:35:29,140 --> 02:35:33,250
like when you take away someone's
ability to decide what they do with their

5158
02:35:33,251 --> 02:35:33,671
body,

5159
02:35:33,671 --> 02:35:36,100
take away like a part of
what makes him a human being.

5160
02:35:37,590 --> 02:35:38,110
It's nuts.

5161
02:35:38,110 --> 02:35:40,240
Drugging them Cosby.

5162
02:35:40,630 --> 02:35:41,560
If that's real.

5163
02:35:41,561 --> 02:35:41,771
I mean,

5164
02:35:41,771 --> 02:35:42,610
obviously we're saying,

5165
02:35:42,640 --> 02:35:43,600
yea,

5166
02:35:43,780 --> 02:35:44,140
I agree,

5167
02:35:44,140 --> 02:35:44,560
but,

5168
02:35:44,560 --> 02:35:46,390
but you said yourself,

5169
02:35:46,720 --> 02:35:48,520
it's when it gets to 17,

5170
02:35:50,140 --> 02:35:51,220
he's not up for discussion.

5171
02:35:51,250 --> 02:35:51,421
Yeah.

5172
02:35:51,421 --> 02:35:51,761
And we,

5173
02:35:51,761 --> 02:35:52,081
you know what,

5174
02:35:52,081 --> 02:35:55,480
you're not talking about a
guy who cheated on his taxes.

5175
02:35:55,960 --> 02:35:57,660
You're not talking about a guy who,

5176
02:35:57,680 --> 02:35:58,470
uh,

5177
02:35:58,470 --> 02:35:58,690
I mean,

5178
02:35:58,690 --> 02:36:00,790
even awful things like drunk driving,

5179
02:36:00,791 --> 02:36:01,560
he said,

5180
02:36:01,560 --> 02:36:01,870
you know,

5181
02:36:01,870 --> 02:36:03,550
like a repeat drunk driver.

5182
02:36:03,590 --> 02:36:04,030
Yeah.

5183
02:36:04,030 --> 02:36:04,930
Fuck man.

5184
02:36:04,931 --> 02:36:05,081
You know,

5185
02:36:05,081 --> 02:36:05,861
it's horrible.

5186
02:36:05,861 --> 02:36:10,861
But there's something
particularly horrible about
a big powerful man who drugs

5187
02:36:12,371 --> 02:36:13,204
women.

5188
02:36:13,930 --> 02:36:14,950
It's terrifying.

5189
02:36:15,490 --> 02:36:17,860
And it's also confusing to
people because they're like,

5190
02:36:18,160 --> 02:36:18,401
God,

5191
02:36:18,401 --> 02:36:19,480
he's so famous.

5192
02:36:19,481 --> 02:36:20,380
He didn't even have what's,

5193
02:36:20,381 --> 02:36:21,191
what's the deal here?

5194
02:36:21,191 --> 02:36:21,601
What's he,

5195
02:36:21,601 --> 02:36:21,790
you know,

5196
02:36:21,790 --> 02:36:23,080
why does he wouldn't,

5197
02:36:23,081 --> 02:36:26,590
he could have done it the right
way and had incredible success.

5198
02:36:27,130 --> 02:36:27,630
Right.

5199
02:36:27,630 --> 02:36:28,540
Use the man.

5200
02:36:28,660 --> 02:36:29,351
Well it's also,

5201
02:36:29,351 --> 02:36:34,060
I think it fits that narrative that
like what is rape would it really is,

5202
02:36:34,061 --> 02:36:35,680
is not sex power.

5203
02:36:35,770 --> 02:36:36,640
Yeah.

5204
02:36:36,910 --> 02:36:37,300
Power.

5205
02:36:37,300 --> 02:36:37,990
And that's,

5206
02:36:37,990 --> 02:36:40,480
that also goes along
with that whole we shit,

5207
02:36:41,110 --> 02:36:41,770
you know?

5208
02:36:41,770 --> 02:36:42,400
Yup.

5209
02:36:42,400 --> 02:36:43,960
I mean the we shit is,

5210
02:36:43,961 --> 02:36:48,961
we do not respond to in you window I
would assume that you had to integrity and

5211
02:36:51,071 --> 02:36:53,500
I was relying upon your integrity.

5212
02:36:54,480 --> 02:36:55,210
Like what?

5213
02:36:55,210 --> 02:36:56,043
Integrity.

5214
02:36:56,590 --> 02:36:57,610
It's creepy man.

5215
02:36:57,700 --> 02:37:01,180
And the guy who's interviewing them is
like really intimidated and there's like

5216
02:37:01,181 --> 02:37:02,380
this weird moment.

5217
02:37:02,500 --> 02:37:03,190
Yep.

5218
02:37:03,190 --> 02:37:04,300
Why is that?

5219
02:37:05,260 --> 02:37:07,000
Because he's not famous and you know,

5220
02:37:07,001 --> 02:37:09,460
it's bill Cosby and your
round them and you're not,

5221
02:37:09,461 --> 02:37:12,310
maybe maybe it doesn't have a lot
of experience and to lose your job,

5222
02:37:12,690 --> 02:37:13,523
maybe.

5223
02:37:14,750 --> 02:37:15,230
No,

5224
02:37:15,230 --> 02:37:16,250
probably what,

5225
02:37:16,880 --> 02:37:19,610
what the concept of what the fallout
would be for asking that question.

5226
02:37:19,640 --> 02:37:19,821
Well,

5227
02:37:19,821 --> 02:37:22,700
what would you do in that situation if
you were the guy who was interviewing

5228
02:37:22,701 --> 02:37:22,850
him?

5229
02:37:22,850 --> 02:37:23,601
What'd you push it?

5230
02:37:23,601 --> 02:37:25,310
Which my me or like who are you?

5231
02:37:25,311 --> 02:37:27,830
You're you right now and you have some,

5232
02:37:27,831 --> 02:37:31,100
for some reason they give you a camera
and they let you interview bill Cosby.

5233
02:37:31,220 --> 02:37:32,390
Holy Fuck.

5234
02:37:32,410 --> 02:37:34,220
And he wants to talk about as NBC Sitcoms,

5235
02:37:34,250 --> 02:37:37,940
anytime somebody you get the feeling
that somebody is deceiving you,

5236
02:37:39,350 --> 02:37:40,183
uh,

5237
02:37:40,520 --> 02:37:40,940
you,

5238
02:37:40,940 --> 02:37:42,080
I mean me personally,

5239
02:37:42,081 --> 02:37:44,690
I can't help but not give into that.

5240
02:37:45,110 --> 02:37:46,850
I can't help it not give into it.

5241
02:37:46,851 --> 02:37:48,350
You mean to the deception?

5242
02:37:48,380 --> 02:37:49,010
Yeah.

5243
02:37:49,010 --> 02:37:49,640
Like I watch,

5244
02:37:49,640 --> 02:37:51,980
like I talked earlier about
watching help not give into it,

5245
02:37:52,340 --> 02:37:54,650
giving given to it in the
sense that challenge it.

5246
02:37:54,710 --> 02:37:55,010
Okay.

5247
02:37:55,010 --> 02:37:55,190
Yeah.

5248
02:37:55,190 --> 02:37:55,780
Yeah.

5249
02:37:55,780 --> 02:37:56,080
Uh,

5250
02:37:56,080 --> 02:37:56,811
I've talked earlier,

5251
02:37:56,811 --> 02:37:58,100
but watching the first 48,

5252
02:37:58,101 --> 02:37:59,900
like my favorite part
is the interrogation.

5253
02:38:00,920 --> 02:38:01,610
It's like,

5254
02:38:01,610 --> 02:38:02,150
it's creepy.

5255
02:38:02,150 --> 02:38:02,890
It's the,

5256
02:38:02,890 --> 02:38:03,280
the,

5257
02:38:03,280 --> 02:38:03,620
the,

5258
02:38:03,620 --> 02:38:05,090
the glimpse into the,

5259
02:38:05,360 --> 02:38:09,600
into the mind for a moment
of how the mind prepares to,

5260
02:38:09,770 --> 02:38:11,750
to defend itself from anything.

5261
02:38:11,900 --> 02:38:16,900
The mind prepares due to self
preservation to say shit and do shit.

5262
02:38:18,440 --> 02:38:20,270
That makes no sense.

5263
02:38:20,570 --> 02:38:25,160
That mean they're tripping over the
excuses in an attempt to save their own

5264
02:38:25,161 --> 02:38:25,994
asses,

5265
02:38:26,060 --> 02:38:28,040
saying things that they
don't even believe.

5266
02:38:28,041 --> 02:38:28,161
Well,

5267
02:38:28,161 --> 02:38:30,980
that's why it's got to be particularly
frustrating if you're innocent.

5268
02:38:30,981 --> 02:38:31,910
And a cop is like,

5269
02:38:31,911 --> 02:38:32,151
look,

5270
02:38:32,151 --> 02:38:32,950
I know you killed her.

5271
02:38:32,950 --> 02:38:33,900
You killed your wife.

5272
02:38:33,960 --> 02:38:34,271
Right?

5273
02:38:34,271 --> 02:38:35,540
What the fuck man,

5274
02:38:35,570 --> 02:38:36,140
that's right.

5275
02:38:36,140 --> 02:38:37,670
Imagine being in that situation.

5276
02:38:37,730 --> 02:38:41,930
The same thing happens like we said
earlier about what would your response be.

5277
02:38:41,931 --> 02:38:43,130
It happens in those rooms,

5278
02:38:43,131 --> 02:38:48,131
in those interrogation rooms where you
get an immediate vibe as a viewer and I'm

5279
02:38:50,241 --> 02:38:55,241
sure that the cops being experienced
are the exact same way that a true date,

5280
02:38:56,860 --> 02:39:01,860
a true creepy fucking skilled murderer
is obviously the worst because of how how

5281
02:39:04,671 --> 02:39:06,320
great of an actor they are,

5282
02:39:06,321 --> 02:39:07,040
how great,

5283
02:39:07,040 --> 02:39:12,040
how great of a job they can do at exposing
all the flaws in how you interpret

5284
02:39:12,741 --> 02:39:13,574
them,

5285
02:39:13,760 --> 02:39:18,630
how they can preemptively figure out
what your questions are going to be in

5286
02:39:18,631 --> 02:39:23,631
already have the answers and someone
who is really planned out deception.

5287
02:39:23,840 --> 02:39:24,261
That's right.

5288
02:39:24,261 --> 02:39:24,561
Deep,

5289
02:39:24,561 --> 02:39:28,490
deep and advance and is used to doing
on a regular basis that there is no

5290
02:39:28,491 --> 02:39:29,324
antidote for that.

5291
02:39:30,170 --> 02:39:34,400
The only antidote for that
is them eventually wanting
to get caught so that they

5292
02:39:34,401 --> 02:39:36,290
could say a smee.

5293
02:39:36,590 --> 02:39:37,610
It's always been me.

5294
02:39:37,640 --> 02:39:41,650
So then they can be on the front fucking
page as the only point at which it

5295
02:39:41,720 --> 02:39:42,553
comes out because,

5296
02:39:43,640 --> 02:39:47,060
but then you also realize watching
that show that those guys,

5297
02:39:47,090 --> 02:39:48,980
those guys are the shit
that dreams are made of.

5298
02:39:48,981 --> 02:39:51,320
Like there's one every fuck,

5299
02:39:51,321 --> 02:39:52,430
I dunno how long,

5300
02:39:52,431 --> 02:39:52,881
true,

5301
02:39:52,881 --> 02:39:53,810
pure evil.

5302
02:39:54,200 --> 02:39:57,620
But the vast majority of them
are not skilled in that arena.

5303
02:39:58,160 --> 02:39:59,240
The vast majority of them are like,

5304
02:39:59,241 --> 02:39:59,661
fuck,

5305
02:39:59,661 --> 02:40:00,800
I don't know how this happened.

5306
02:40:01,370 --> 02:40:02,203
You know,

5307
02:40:02,340 --> 02:40:02,521
they,

5308
02:40:02,521 --> 02:40:02,671
and,

5309
02:40:02,671 --> 02:40:04,490
and they'll try the defense,

5310
02:40:04,840 --> 02:40:06,470
their defense in that state.

5311
02:40:06,800 --> 02:40:08,480
But it's stumbly and it's,

5312
02:40:08,720 --> 02:40:12,020
and it's so obvious that
they're just attempting to,

5313
02:40:12,610 --> 02:40:12,830
you know,

5314
02:40:12,830 --> 02:40:13,640
to spin,

5315
02:40:13,640 --> 02:40:14,070
spin

5316
02:40:14,070 --> 02:40:17,850
a web and then so the cops can figure
out which path they need to take,

5317
02:40:17,910 --> 02:40:18,350
uh,

5318
02:40:18,350 --> 02:40:19,080
to,

5319
02:40:19,080 --> 02:40:19,980
but it's very,

5320
02:40:19,981 --> 02:40:21,480
very weird watching it because I,

5321
02:40:21,750 --> 02:40:22,201
at times,

5322
02:40:22,201 --> 02:40:23,940
I feel like a sociopath watching it.

5323
02:40:25,130 --> 02:40:26,940
Brett Dunkin calls it murder porn.

5324
02:40:27,360 --> 02:40:28,530
I completely agree.

5325
02:40:28,980 --> 02:40:31,920
I completely agree with him
because I watched it and I go,

5326
02:40:32,010 --> 02:40:32,843
uh,

5327
02:40:33,300 --> 02:40:33,630
you know,

5328
02:40:33,630 --> 02:40:35,160
I know all the right answers.

5329
02:40:35,161 --> 02:40:36,240
I'm skilled enough now.

5330
02:40:36,660 --> 02:40:37,351
That's weird,

5331
02:40:37,351 --> 02:40:37,580
right?

5332
02:40:37,580 --> 02:40:40,860
You can educate yourself
watching first 48 that's right.

5333
02:40:42,720 --> 02:40:43,553
Do you think?

5334
02:40:43,590 --> 02:40:44,490
Here's a real question.

5335
02:40:44,520 --> 02:40:44,970
Yeah.

5336
02:40:44,970 --> 02:40:49,970
Do you think that as we get access to
more information about each other and

5337
02:40:53,160 --> 02:40:54,570
access to each other's thoughts,

5338
02:40:54,571 --> 02:40:56,320
like literally the,

5339
02:40:56,321 --> 02:40:56,561
the,

5340
02:40:56,561 --> 02:40:57,271
the calm,

5341
02:40:57,271 --> 02:41:02,271
the point in time where 10 years from now
and we can record our memories and our

5342
02:41:02,641 --> 02:41:05,370
thoughts on some sort of a hard
drive and have it be exchange,

5343
02:41:05,400 --> 02:41:06,870
whether it's 10 or 50 or a hundred,

5344
02:41:07,020 --> 02:41:07,800
whatever it is,

5345
02:41:07,800 --> 02:41:10,350
will we get to a point
where we eliminate evil?

5346
02:41:10,590 --> 02:41:11,640
Is that possible?

5347
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:17,000
Is it possible to get to a point
where we eliminate things like murder,

5348
02:41:17,730 --> 02:41:18,563
rape,

5349
02:41:18,780 --> 02:41:20,370
crimes against people?

5350
02:41:20,400 --> 02:41:25,400
Why would an openness a
effect that consequences
either is 100% consequences to

5351
02:41:27,061 --> 02:41:27,810
your action?

5352
02:41:27,810 --> 02:41:30,470
The only time you come
still completely in,

5353
02:41:30,490 --> 02:41:32,400
in incomplete surveillance.

5354
02:41:32,490 --> 02:41:33,290
Yeah.

5355
02:41:33,290 --> 02:41:35,790
There's no opportunity to do
it without getting caught.

5356
02:41:36,120 --> 02:41:36,953
Yeah.

5357
02:41:38,430 --> 02:41:39,263
Uh,

5358
02:41:41,580 --> 02:41:42,750
what do you think about pedophiles

5359
02:41:44,780 --> 02:41:46,260
out a vinyl scare the shit out of me,

5360
02:41:46,261 --> 02:41:47,430
obviously because I have kids,

5361
02:41:47,431 --> 02:41:49,220
but buckets because I'm,

5362
02:41:49,320 --> 02:41:50,880
because I watched that,

5363
02:41:50,940 --> 02:41:51,360
uh,

5364
02:41:51,360 --> 02:41:53,040
Louis thorough thing he did on pedophiles.

5365
02:41:55,110 --> 02:41:56,070
They don't have a choice.

5366
02:41:56,610 --> 02:41:57,240
Some of them,

5367
02:41:57,240 --> 02:41:58,800
some of them don't know.

5368
02:41:59,040 --> 02:41:59,641
I think,

5369
02:41:59,641 --> 02:42:00,150
uh,

5370
02:42:00,150 --> 02:42:01,890
do you know a disproportionate
amount of lefthanded

5371
02:42:03,570 --> 02:42:04,403
Jesus,

5372
02:42:04,740 --> 02:42:06,930
disproportionate amount of
pedophiles are lefthanded.

5373
02:42:07,620 --> 02:42:08,101
There's a,

5374
02:42:08,101 --> 02:42:12,720
there was an article in New York Times
that was arguing for pedophilia being a

5375
02:42:12,721 --> 02:42:16,010
mental disorder that can be isolated and,

5376
02:42:16,011 --> 02:42:16,440
and,

5377
02:42:16,440 --> 02:42:18,180
and viewed that you can,

5378
02:42:18,210 --> 02:42:20,730
you can actually figure
out what went wrong,

5379
02:42:20,731 --> 02:42:23,250
what genes went wrong with what,

5380
02:42:23,251 --> 02:42:23,580
you know,

5381
02:42:23,580 --> 02:42:24,600
what genes,

5382
02:42:24,750 --> 02:42:27,870
the final scene in that movie,

5383
02:42:28,690 --> 02:42:29,190
uh,

5384
02:42:29,190 --> 02:42:29,911
maybe not the final,

5385
02:42:29,911 --> 02:42:31,590
but near the end in his documentary.

5386
02:42:31,591 --> 02:42:36,591
So he called a movie is the guy that
he's been going around with the uh,

5387
02:42:37,110 --> 02:42:38,280
he basically his guide,

5388
02:42:38,281 --> 02:42:42,240
the guy who's running the facility
for the dudes who are responsible for

5389
02:42:42,241 --> 02:42:44,850
pedophilia and whatever
other sexual offenses.

5390
02:42:46,110 --> 02:42:49,470
And he finally gets around to asking
him the question because he has a little

5391
02:42:49,471 --> 02:42:52,350
bit of an idea of the history
of how he ended up in all this.

5392
02:42:53,340 --> 02:42:58,340
And his reason for molesting
or raping his two boys

5393
02:43:02,190 --> 02:43:06,290
was that his wife wasn't putting out Whoa,

5394
02:43:06,370 --> 02:43:07,950
fuck Christ.

5395
02:43:08,040 --> 02:43:10,890
His wife wasn't putting out and the,

5396
02:43:11,230 --> 02:43:11,980
that he was going to

5397
02:43:11,980 --> 02:43:13,000
get back at her.

5398
02:43:13,120 --> 02:43:13,953
Oh God.

5399
02:43:15,430 --> 02:43:19,240
Was to take it out on their two kids.

5400
02:43:23,500 --> 02:43:24,333
Oh,

5401
02:43:24,390 --> 02:43:28,330
I've heard of people doing that in
terms of killing their kids to Yup.

5402
02:43:28,350 --> 02:43:29,460
To get back at their wife.

5403
02:43:29,500 --> 02:43:30,450
They've killed their kids.

5404
02:43:30,660 --> 02:43:31,493
Yup.

5405
02:43:33,270 --> 02:43:33,481
Yeah.

5406
02:43:33,481 --> 02:43:34,680
There's some fucked up humans,

5407
02:43:34,681 --> 02:43:35,370
man.

5408
02:43:35,370 --> 02:43:35,880
You know,

5409
02:43:35,880 --> 02:43:36,300
but

5410
02:43:36,300 --> 02:43:36,961
particular case,

5411
02:43:36,961 --> 02:43:41,961
the creepiest part about all of it was
that the guy seemed way too normal.

5412
02:43:42,930 --> 02:43:44,700
He seemed throughout the entire,

5413
02:43:44,701 --> 02:43:44,970
uh,

5414
02:43:44,970 --> 02:43:45,930
documentary.

5415
02:43:46,800 --> 02:43:49,800
He was like the most
relatable one of all of them.

5416
02:43:50,460 --> 02:43:51,293
You know,

5417
02:43:51,390 --> 02:43:51,900
he was,

5418
02:43:51,900 --> 02:43:53,040
he essentially was,

5419
02:43:53,070 --> 02:43:53,903
was driving,

5420
02:43:53,910 --> 02:43:54,780
driving him around.

5421
02:43:54,781 --> 02:43:55,690
He was the one explaining,

5422
02:43:55,710 --> 02:43:57,390
he's almost the narrator
of the entire thing,

5423
02:43:57,391 --> 02:43:59,040
with the exception of Louie himself.

5424
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:00,930
And uh,

5425
02:44:02,250 --> 02:44:03,900
it's almost like the dude,

5426
02:44:03,901 --> 02:44:04,620
uh,

5427
02:44:04,620 --> 02:44:05,041
you know,

5428
02:44:05,041 --> 02:44:07,790
you have your traditional
mindset of like what,

5429
02:44:07,791 --> 02:44:08,850
what a pedophile is.

5430
02:44:08,851 --> 02:44:09,211
Like.

5431
02:44:09,211 --> 02:44:11,430
Maybe they were molested themselves or

5432
02:44:13,110 --> 02:44:14,430
they can't help it or whatever.

5433
02:44:14,431 --> 02:44:15,300
But in this guy's case,

5434
02:44:15,301 --> 02:44:17,910
it just seemed like a fucking psycho.

5435
02:44:18,360 --> 02:44:18,750
Well,

5436
02:44:18,750 --> 02:44:20,680
I think when we think about what,

5437
02:44:21,250 --> 02:44:22,300
what entails,

5438
02:44:22,330 --> 02:44:22,801
like what,

5439
02:44:22,801 --> 02:44:25,660
what ingredients are involved
and creating a human being,

5440
02:44:26,560 --> 02:44:29,560
there's so many variables,

5441
02:44:29,590 --> 02:44:31,300
so many situations that come up.

5442
02:44:31,301 --> 02:44:36,301
So much information that gets passed
from birth to whatever crime is committed

5443
02:44:39,820 --> 02:44:41,740
from birth to shooting up a school.

5444
02:44:42,160 --> 02:44:44,870
There is so much going on,

5445
02:44:44,890 --> 02:44:49,450
there's so much data and it's so
difficult to discern like what is it that

5446
02:44:49,451 --> 02:44:52,990
causes someone to become a murderer
and what is it that becomes,

5447
02:44:53,260 --> 02:44:56,740
that causes someone to choose a life of
crime or to become a rapist or to do,

5448
02:44:56,890 --> 02:44:58,210
to do anything that harms what,

5449
02:44:58,240 --> 02:44:58,630
what,

5450
02:44:58,630 --> 02:45:03,430
where does it go and how can that
be prevented and just becoming you.

5451
02:45:03,460 --> 02:45:03,821
Okay.

5452
02:45:03,821 --> 02:45:04,810
Becoming a nice guy,

5453
02:45:04,811 --> 02:45:05,980
becoming who you are.

5454
02:45:06,010 --> 02:45:10,510
Like think about all the fucking variables
that are involved and becoming you

5455
02:45:10,511 --> 02:45:12,040
and what could have gone wrong.

5456
02:45:12,160 --> 02:45:14,140
All sorts of things along the way.

5457
02:45:14,320 --> 02:45:16,390
What drugs could you
have been introduced to?

5458
02:45:16,391 --> 02:45:18,160
How many times could you have
been dropped in your head?

5459
02:45:18,280 --> 02:45:20,380
What things could've gone wrong that have,

5460
02:45:20,770 --> 02:45:21,571
but how do this,

5461
02:45:21,571 --> 02:45:21,700
hey,

5462
02:45:21,700 --> 02:45:22,533
can you completely off?

5463
02:45:22,600 --> 02:45:27,600
How did this Guy Soak in just and
state and how did he fake it so long?

5464
02:45:29,470 --> 02:45:30,303
Is he facing

5465
02:45:30,450 --> 02:45:31,350
or is he broken?

5466
02:45:31,380 --> 02:45:31,681
Does he,

5467
02:45:31,681 --> 02:45:33,600
is he lacking empathy?

5468
02:45:33,630 --> 02:45:35,670
Is he missing some sort of a social,

5469
02:45:35,910 --> 02:45:37,290
he was broken the whole time.

5470
02:45:37,291 --> 02:45:39,450
He had people fooled for years.

5471
02:45:39,720 --> 02:45:44,490
He had enough time to
be normal enough to not,

5472
02:45:44,940 --> 02:45:45,380
uh,

5473
02:45:45,380 --> 02:45:47,640
exercise those thoughts he was having,

5474
02:45:47,641 --> 02:45:50,430
I guess if we want to make the
argument that he was always like that,

5475
02:45:51,060 --> 02:45:52,380
but in his particular case,

5476
02:45:52,470 --> 02:45:55,890
the thing that affected me
more than any of that was that,

5477
02:45:55,920 --> 02:45:56,760
oh fuck.

5478
02:45:56,940 --> 02:45:58,740
I feel like this guy just snapped.

5479
02:46:00,120 --> 02:46:04,140
I feel like this guy wasn't broken.

5480
02:46:04,420 --> 02:46:05,181
Not Possible though.

5481
02:46:05,181 --> 02:46:05,901
Think about you.

5482
02:46:05,901 --> 02:46:06,131
What,

5483
02:46:06,131 --> 02:46:09,440
what could your wife possibly do to
get you to fuck your kids police?

5484
02:46:09,500 --> 02:46:10,333
You know what I'm saying?

5485
02:46:10,670 --> 02:46:11,570
It's not possible.

5486
02:46:11,720 --> 02:46:13,730
I something wrong along the way.

5487
02:46:13,731 --> 02:46:18,731
Maybe it's some sort of a inability
to recognize his own actions and non

5488
02:46:19,821 --> 02:46:22,070
introspective quality to his life.

5489
02:46:22,190 --> 02:46:24,680
A block that he put up early on in life.

5490
02:46:24,710 --> 02:46:25,300
Yes.

5491
02:46:25,300 --> 02:46:25,550
There's,

5492
02:46:25,550 --> 02:46:25,880
you're,

5493
02:46:25,880 --> 02:46:29,840
you're completely correct in the sense
that there's probably more to it,

5494
02:46:29,841 --> 02:46:32,930
but I think the scariest
thing to the regular person is

5495
02:46:34,520 --> 02:46:35,570
he's too regular.

5496
02:46:35,870 --> 02:46:36,650
Yeah.

5497
02:46:36,650 --> 02:46:37,251
That's theory.

5498
02:46:37,251 --> 02:46:38,330
I don't even know the guy.

5499
02:46:38,331 --> 02:46:39,560
And you're describing them to me.

5500
02:46:39,740 --> 02:46:40,790
I didn't watch the whole document.

5501
02:46:40,791 --> 02:46:42,110
I went on a Louie thorough,

5502
02:46:42,440 --> 02:46:43,130
um,

5503
02:46:43,130 --> 02:46:44,000
marathon,

5504
02:46:44,030 --> 02:46:47,540
which is on my just very easy to
do because he's fucking awesome.

5505
02:46:47,630 --> 02:46:48,530
He's really awesome.

5506
02:46:48,650 --> 02:46:50,450
He's a really interesting
guy to talk to you too.

5507
02:46:50,780 --> 02:46:55,550
So I watched the Fred Phelps won and
I watched the African hunting one.

5508
02:46:55,550 --> 02:46:57,260
I watched the whole series of them,

5509
02:46:57,320 --> 02:46:59,030
so I didn't watch the whole one.

5510
02:46:59,031 --> 02:47:00,230
So I don't know that dude.

5511
02:47:00,310 --> 02:47:01,143
I can't,

5512
02:47:01,340 --> 02:47:03,440
I don't know if I would
even recommend to watch it,

5513
02:47:03,500 --> 02:47:04,610
but just because of that.

5514
02:47:04,611 --> 02:47:05,210
It's really,

5515
02:47:05,210 --> 02:47:05,600
it's,

5516
02:47:05,600 --> 02:47:06,980
it's intense man.

5517
02:47:07,330 --> 02:47:07,580
Yeah.

5518
02:47:07,580 --> 02:47:07,881
I mean,

5519
02:47:07,881 --> 02:47:10,340
what goes into creating a you,

5520
02:47:10,460 --> 02:47:10,761
I mean,

5521
02:47:10,761 --> 02:47:12,530
what I mean when I say you,

5522
02:47:12,531 --> 02:47:16,400
I mean everybody who's listening think
about all the things I think all the time

5523
02:47:16,401 --> 02:47:18,770
about what made me me,

5524
02:47:19,220 --> 02:47:19,760
you know,

5525
02:47:19,760 --> 02:47:20,071
the,

5526
02:47:20,071 --> 02:47:21,650
the idea of determinism,

5527
02:47:21,651 --> 02:47:22,580
the idea of the,

5528
02:47:22,581 --> 02:47:23,600
all the variables,

5529
02:47:23,601 --> 02:47:24,560
your genetics,

5530
02:47:24,561 --> 02:47:25,730
your environment,

5531
02:47:25,760 --> 02:47:26,593
your,

5532
02:47:26,640 --> 02:47:27,950
the input,

5533
02:47:28,020 --> 02:47:29,360
your life experiences,

5534
02:47:29,361 --> 02:47:30,051
your successes,

5535
02:47:30,051 --> 02:47:30,621
your failures,

5536
02:47:30,621 --> 02:47:31,190
your locks,

5537
02:47:31,190 --> 02:47:32,960
you're zigging when you should've zagged.

5538
02:47:32,961 --> 02:47:36,290
You're hitting the brakes and a
meteor lands in front of your car.

5539
02:47:36,530 --> 02:47:36,801
I mean,

5540
02:47:36,801 --> 02:47:40,340
there's so many fucking things
that happen in your life.

5541
02:47:40,550 --> 02:47:45,550
And one thing that goes awful
early can send you down a bad road,

5542
02:47:46,041 --> 02:47:49,640
which could send you to another awful
thing which could send you down a bad

5543
02:47:49,641 --> 02:47:50,474
road.

5544
02:47:50,540 --> 02:47:51,770
It's like a,

5545
02:47:52,370 --> 02:47:53,300
it's like you know,

5546
02:47:53,510 --> 02:47:55,790
many dimensions playing
out in front of you,

5547
02:47:55,791 --> 02:47:56,481
like the,

5548
02:47:56,481 --> 02:47:57,440
the potential,

5549
02:47:57,920 --> 02:48:01,700
the potential outcome of every single
event and the effect of that an impact.

5550
02:48:01,701 --> 02:48:05,270
And it makes you really
question everything.

5551
02:48:05,300 --> 02:48:06,590
Our existence as a whole,

5552
02:48:06,630 --> 02:48:08,000
that the possibilities of that,

5553
02:48:08,030 --> 02:48:08,810
you know,

5554
02:48:08,810 --> 02:48:10,190
what also makes you wonder,

5555
02:48:10,220 --> 02:48:14,000
is it possible to ever completely
socially engineered the human race?

5556
02:48:14,210 --> 02:48:19,210
Is it possible that we could get our shit
together 100% and have no evil and no

5557
02:48:19,311 --> 02:48:20,720
crime and no rape,

5558
02:48:20,721 --> 02:48:22,100
no murder and all done.

5559
02:48:22,101 --> 02:48:22,640
We're done.

5560
02:48:22,640 --> 02:48:23,150
We're good.

5561
02:48:23,150 --> 02:48:24,320
We're all utopia now we're,

5562
02:48:24,321 --> 02:48:27,770
I'll just come by ya and hugging each
other and smiling to our neighbors because

5563
02:48:27,771 --> 02:48:29,120
the whole world's our neighborhood now.

5564
02:48:29,180 --> 02:48:32,570
I think we are so addicted to conflict
that will find a way to fuck it up.

5565
02:48:32,690 --> 02:48:33,523
But are we,

5566
02:48:33,560 --> 02:48:34,910
are we always going to be,

5567
02:48:34,911 --> 02:48:35,780
this is the question.

5568
02:48:36,170 --> 02:48:38,690
Are we the same thing today?

5569
02:48:38,691 --> 02:48:42,200
That will be will be a million years from
now or are we just like those monkeys

5570
02:48:42,201 --> 02:48:44,990
that came down out of the trees instead
of experimenting with new food sources

5571
02:48:44,991 --> 02:48:48,980
and started eating meat and we'll
find other people to do it for us.

5572
02:48:49,010 --> 02:48:52,100
We'll find other things to do it for
us a million years from now do isn't

5573
02:48:52,101 --> 02:48:53,810
impossible that we can evolve past this.

5574
02:48:53,840 --> 02:48:55,430
Like we have evolved,

5575
02:48:55,460 --> 02:48:56,570
at least in this room.

5576
02:48:56,590 --> 02:48:56,930
Yeah.

5577
02:48:56,930 --> 02:48:59,740
We have gotten to a point
where I'm not worried about I,

5578
02:48:59,760 --> 02:49:01,190
we could all go to sleep
together in this room.

5579
02:49:01,191 --> 02:49:02,120
I'm not worried about it either.

5580
02:49:02,121 --> 02:49:03,710
If you guys hit me in
the head with a rock,

5581
02:49:04,160 --> 02:49:04,993
you know what I mean?

5582
02:49:05,120 --> 02:49:07,650
But if we were living in the Congo,

5583
02:49:07,710 --> 02:49:08,070
that

5584
02:49:08,070 --> 02:49:08,821
could be an issue.

5585
02:49:08,821 --> 02:49:10,970
If we were living in the
Congo a million years ago,

5586
02:49:11,040 --> 02:49:11,873
that could be an issue.

5587
02:49:11,910 --> 02:49:12,930
I suppose for me,

5588
02:49:13,020 --> 02:49:18,020
what I fear more than the
people around me is the,

5589
02:49:18,300 --> 02:49:22,200
and their decisions is the
proliferation of negativity in general.

5590
02:49:22,260 --> 02:49:22,860
Ryan,

5591
02:49:22,860 --> 02:49:26,280
why the fuck does this terrible
shit spread like wildfire?

5592
02:49:26,480 --> 02:49:27,810
Why is the news the news?

5593
02:49:28,660 --> 02:49:29,150
We all,

5594
02:49:29,150 --> 02:49:30,480
we all still want it.

5595
02:49:30,570 --> 02:49:32,970
We just don't want to
participate in a physical way,

5596
02:49:33,270 --> 02:49:34,950
but don't you think like this,

5597
02:49:34,951 --> 02:49:36,760
this riot things going on,

5598
02:49:36,780 --> 02:49:39,490
this closing of highways
all across the country.

5599
02:49:39,900 --> 02:49:44,280
The good in that of course is that
there are so many people that regardless

5600
02:49:44,281 --> 02:49:46,050
whether or not the
narrative fix the facts,

5601
02:49:46,830 --> 02:49:51,830
what they want to do is they want to
stand up for inequality and even if it's

5602
02:49:52,381 --> 02:49:54,510
not actually inequality
they want to stand up for,

5603
02:49:54,511 --> 02:49:57,990
and it most certainly is in some way
because this guy who no matter what,

5604
02:49:57,991 --> 02:50:00,120
whether what Arbill
things he actually did do,

5605
02:50:00,270 --> 02:50:01,530
he didn't grow up in your neighborhood.

5606
02:50:01,620 --> 02:50:02,730
He didn't grow up in my neighborhood.

5607
02:50:03,300 --> 02:50:05,400
I got a fucking pretty sweet life.

5608
02:50:05,570 --> 02:50:09,650
I had skated through the difficulties
that I had only made me a better person.

5609
02:50:09,680 --> 02:50:14,680
Here I am in 2014 with no fucking
criminal record and it never hurt anybody.

5610
02:50:15,151 --> 02:50:15,780
Everything's fine.

5611
02:50:15,780 --> 02:50:16,110
Cool.

5612
02:50:16,110 --> 02:50:16,471
You know what I mean?

5613
02:50:16,471 --> 02:50:17,400
This guy for you,

5614
02:50:17,670 --> 02:50:18,503
thank you very much.

5615
02:50:18,510 --> 02:50:19,470
This guy didn't,

5616
02:50:19,790 --> 02:50:20,340
he didn't,

5617
02:50:20,340 --> 02:50:23,370
his scenario was vastly
different than yours in mind.

5618
02:50:23,460 --> 02:50:28,460
So whatever played out that allowed
him to get in front of that cop,

5619
02:50:29,100 --> 02:50:32,940
I think what people are standing up
for is not just police brutality.

5620
02:50:33,120 --> 02:50:36,860
They're standing up for this recognition
that there is inequality in the world

5621
02:50:37,210 --> 02:50:38,010
to be addressed.

5622
02:50:38,010 --> 02:50:38,700
Of course,

5623
02:50:38,700 --> 02:50:40,590
that's one of the poorest
areas in the country.

5624
02:50:41,170 --> 02:50:41,880
Yeah,

5625
02:50:41,880 --> 02:50:42,660
it's fucked.

5626
02:50:42,660 --> 02:50:42,871
Yeah.

5627
02:50:42,871 --> 02:50:47,430
I was looking at like crime statistics
the other day and like adjusted for

5628
02:50:47,431 --> 02:50:52,380
population that is a fucking war zone
way there without this police shooting.

5629
02:50:52,380 --> 02:50:53,213
You know what I mean?

5630
02:50:53,580 --> 02:50:58,580
It's ultra poor and I know that the reason
people are attaching themselves to it

5631
02:50:58,921 --> 02:51:03,921
is inequality and it's unfortunate I
guess that it takes this particular set of

5632
02:51:04,501 --> 02:51:08,460
circumstances to have that conversation.

5633
02:51:08,880 --> 02:51:10,020
But uh,

5634
02:51:10,620 --> 02:51:15,620
ultimately you can't really have a healthy
society when there's the nat level,

5635
02:51:16,410 --> 02:51:20,550
that disproportion between
people who have stuff in people.

5636
02:51:20,610 --> 02:51:24,450
But you also can't have a society
that's 300 fucking 50 million people in

5637
02:51:24,451 --> 02:51:24,960
general.

5638
02:51:24,960 --> 02:51:25,201
I mean,

5639
02:51:25,201 --> 02:51:25,451
how,

5640
02:51:25,451 --> 02:51:27,870
how are you going to
organize 350 million people?

5641
02:51:28,140 --> 02:51:28,710
It's,

5642
02:51:28,710 --> 02:51:30,140
it's amazing that it works at all.

5643
02:51:30,270 --> 02:51:31,103
To be honest.

5644
02:51:31,830 --> 02:51:33,330
A poor community.

5645
02:51:33,750 --> 02:51:35,970
Anywhere where the crime is low.

5646
02:51:37,350 --> 02:51:38,310
It's a great question.

5647
02:51:39,300 --> 02:51:39,751
I think,

5648
02:51:39,751 --> 02:51:43,740
I don't know how much of it is about being
poor in general and how much of it is

5649
02:51:43,741 --> 02:51:44,580
subjective.

5650
02:51:44,880 --> 02:51:49,500
Like if being poor in America means being
poor relative to the richest people on

5651
02:51:49,501 --> 02:51:50,130
the planet,

5652
02:51:50,130 --> 02:51:50,550
right.

5653
02:51:50,550 --> 02:51:53,490
That's a different ball game and
being poor in India I have no,

5654
02:51:53,491 --> 02:51:55,560
maybe not because now there's
rich people there too,

5655
02:51:55,561 --> 02:51:58,790
but being poor in an environment
where everyone's poor,

5656
02:51:58,800 --> 02:51:59,633
you really pour,

5657
02:51:59,760 --> 02:52:02,250
do you know what the 1% of the world is?

5658
02:52:02,251 --> 02:52:06,450
You know what the number is that
you have to make to be in the,

5659
02:52:06,550 --> 02:52:07,241
in the global one,

5660
02:52:07,241 --> 02:52:08,074
top 1%.

5661
02:52:08,230 --> 02:52:09,850
It's way lower than people think,

5662
02:52:09,870 --> 02:52:10,150
right?

5663
02:52:10,150 --> 02:52:10,391
Yeah.

5664
02:52:10,391 --> 02:52:11,224
What would you think it would be?

5665
02:52:11,890 --> 02:52:14,140
I feel like I'm cheating because
you may have mentioned it before.

5666
02:52:14,170 --> 02:52:14,411
Okay,

5667
02:52:14,411 --> 02:52:14,950
go ahead.

5668
02:52:14,950 --> 02:52:19,730
Was it something like
40,000 or 35 34 35 yeah.

5669
02:52:20,050 --> 02:52:25,050
Anything more than $34,000 and you are
in the top 1% of the world privilege.

5670
02:52:27,520 --> 02:52:28,353
Enormous,

5671
02:52:28,450 --> 02:52:30,280
enormous privilege in this country.

5672
02:52:30,400 --> 02:52:30,610
You know,

5673
02:52:30,610 --> 02:52:31,480
enormous privilege.

5674
02:52:32,040 --> 02:52:32,770
That's an,

5675
02:52:32,770 --> 02:52:33,670
that seems like,

5676
02:52:33,700 --> 02:52:33,971
like,

5677
02:52:33,971 --> 02:52:34,390
Whoa,

5678
02:52:34,390 --> 02:52:34,990
like that.

5679
02:52:34,990 --> 02:52:35,950
Strengthen the borders,

5680
02:52:36,040 --> 02:52:36,873
increase the military.

5681
02:52:37,120 --> 02:52:38,800
It's impossible to overcome that number.

5682
02:52:38,800 --> 02:52:40,190
Like I hear where they were dealing with,

5683
02:52:40,480 --> 02:52:41,710
I thought we're going to fix the world,

5684
02:52:41,711 --> 02:52:42,190
but,

5685
02:52:42,190 --> 02:52:42,640
uh,

5686
02:52:42,640 --> 02:52:43,061
listen,

5687
02:52:43,061 --> 02:52:43,781
I'm 47,

5688
02:52:43,781 --> 02:52:45,310
I'll see a whole lot of time to do this.

5689
02:52:45,311 --> 02:52:48,550
So let's just fucking live in a
gated community and get a gun that's,

5690
02:52:48,850 --> 02:52:49,151
you know,

5691
02:52:49,151 --> 02:52:49,780
that's you d,

5692
02:52:49,780 --> 02:52:51,940
How do you psychologically deal with that?

5693
02:52:52,750 --> 02:52:53,583
Um,

5694
02:52:54,610 --> 02:52:55,810
the idea of privilege.

5695
02:52:56,410 --> 02:52:57,243
What can you do?

5696
02:52:57,430 --> 02:52:58,060
What can you do?

5697
02:52:58,060 --> 02:52:58,301
I mean,

5698
02:52:58,301 --> 02:52:58,990
it's real.

5699
02:52:58,990 --> 02:53:00,220
It's real as it gets.

5700
02:53:00,250 --> 02:53:00,491
It's,

5701
02:53:00,491 --> 02:53:01,540
there's no doubt about it.

5702
02:53:01,570 --> 02:53:03,130
There's some or feeling guilty about it.

5703
02:53:03,560 --> 02:53:05,440
Can't feel guilty about where you are.

5704
02:53:05,650 --> 02:53:06,130
I mean,

5705
02:53:06,130 --> 02:53:09,910
I would feel guilty if I
victimize somebody can't
feel guilty about being born

5706
02:53:09,911 --> 02:53:10,744
lucky.

5707
02:53:10,820 --> 02:53:11,250
Wow.

5708
02:53:11,250 --> 02:53:12,130
If you can,

5709
02:53:12,280 --> 02:53:12,551
I mean,

5710
02:53:12,551 --> 02:53:14,230
can you feel guilty
about being born lucky?

5711
02:53:14,231 --> 02:53:14,620
I don't.

5712
02:53:14,620 --> 02:53:16,790
I feel bad for people
who aren't born like,

5713
02:53:16,791 --> 02:53:17,170
right.

5714
02:53:17,170 --> 02:53:17,981
I see what you're saying.

5715
02:53:17,981 --> 02:53:18,910
It's a little different.

5716
02:53:18,910 --> 02:53:19,743
But look,

5717
02:53:20,320 --> 02:53:21,070
Bill Cosby,

5718
02:53:21,070 --> 02:53:22,480
if he did it should feel guilty.

5719
02:53:22,580 --> 02:53:22,900
Yes.

5720
02:53:22,900 --> 02:53:23,291
What I'm saying.

5721
02:53:23,291 --> 02:53:26,620
You shouldn't feel guilty that you are,

5722
02:53:26,880 --> 02:53:27,400
you know,

5723
02:53:27,400 --> 02:53:28,810
not a woman that's being raped.

5724
02:53:29,400 --> 02:53:29,810
Shit.

5725
02:53:29,810 --> 02:53:30,640
Do you know what I'm saying?

5726
02:53:30,640 --> 02:53:31,060
Yeah.

5727
02:53:31,060 --> 02:53:31,281
I don't,

5728
02:53:31,281 --> 02:53:31,451
I'm,

5729
02:53:31,451 --> 02:53:32,860
guilt might not be the right word,

5730
02:53:32,861 --> 02:53:34,390
but uh,

5731
02:53:34,870 --> 02:53:36,460
there are days where I feel lucky.

5732
02:53:36,660 --> 02:53:37,340
Right.

5733
02:53:37,340 --> 02:53:37,601
You know,

5734
02:53:37,601 --> 02:53:38,440
if you're lucky every day.

5735
02:53:38,441 --> 02:53:38,621
Yeah.

5736
02:53:38,621 --> 02:53:39,454
So what's the,

5737
02:53:39,610 --> 02:53:40,443
what's the,

5738
02:53:41,020 --> 02:53:42,250
what's the other end of that?

5739
02:53:42,580 --> 02:53:42,950
You know,

5740
02:53:42,950 --> 02:53:43,360
I,

5741
02:53:43,360 --> 02:53:44,680
maybe guilt is not the right word,

5742
02:53:44,681 --> 02:53:47,290
but there are people who wake up
everyday and feel shitty Bryant.

5743
02:53:48,010 --> 02:53:50,080
And so I guess I don't feel guilty,

5744
02:53:50,081 --> 02:53:54,460
but I don't feel great that knowing that
the vast majority of the planet isn't,

5745
02:53:55,360 --> 02:53:55,901
but then again,

5746
02:53:55,901 --> 02:53:57,310
what the fuck is happiness really?

5747
02:53:57,760 --> 02:53:58,220
Well,

5748
02:53:58,220 --> 02:54:00,940
then the other thing is how
much money is it relative?

5749
02:54:00,941 --> 02:54:03,790
Like how much money does the vast
majority of the planet need to live their

5750
02:54:03,791 --> 02:54:04,624
lifestyle?

5751
02:54:05,680 --> 02:54:07,060
When you're talking about poverty,

5752
02:54:07,090 --> 02:54:08,740
are they well fed and happy?

5753
02:54:08,741 --> 02:54:09,574
Because,

5754
02:54:10,540 --> 02:54:10,751
yeah,

5755
02:54:10,751 --> 02:54:12,670
I know it's one of the
things about Mexico,

5756
02:54:12,730 --> 02:54:14,770
like they were happy.

5757
02:54:15,130 --> 02:54:17,920
It was like one of the happiest
countries on the planet apparent wow.

5758
02:54:18,360 --> 02:54:21,940
It with all the drug lords and
all the consequences of that.

5759
02:54:21,970 --> 02:54:23,740
That's what most people don't get happy.

5760
02:54:23,770 --> 02:54:25,690
Those people are really unhappy.

5761
02:54:25,691 --> 02:54:27,220
The people that have to
deal with the drug lords,

5762
02:54:27,250 --> 02:54:27,641
it's always,

5763
02:54:27,641 --> 02:54:29,800
it seems to always be a
question of contrast really.

5764
02:54:29,830 --> 02:54:30,663
It's like,

5765
02:54:31,180 --> 02:54:31,960
uh,

5766
02:54:31,960 --> 02:54:32,650
I always come up,

5767
02:54:32,650 --> 02:54:33,720
I come out here to La and,

5768
02:54:33,721 --> 02:54:34,200
and,

5769
02:54:34,200 --> 02:54:37,600
and I'm amazed at how every
single day is exactly the same.

5770
02:54:37,601 --> 02:54:38,950
Like from a weather perspective.

5771
02:54:38,980 --> 02:54:39,580
Oh yeah.

5772
02:54:39,580 --> 02:54:43,540
Like I left the apocalypse back
home to come here and it's like,

5773
02:54:43,541 --> 02:54:44,680
it could be July,

5774
02:54:45,800 --> 02:54:47,990
in November and this new July.

5775
02:54:48,030 --> 02:54:48,191
Yeah.

5776
02:54:48,191 --> 02:54:49,150
There's no time.

5777
02:54:49,270 --> 02:54:52,510
The only thing I will say is it
gets dark incredibly quickly.

5778
02:54:52,630 --> 02:54:53,890
Especially being by the beach.

5779
02:54:53,891 --> 02:54:56,950
It's like in 20 minutes because we're
trying to shoot videos and stuff.

5780
02:54:57,000 --> 02:54:57,221
Like,

5781
02:54:57,221 --> 02:54:57,641
Whoa,

5782
02:54:57,641 --> 02:54:58,660
where did the Sun Go?

5783
02:54:58,990 --> 02:54:59,823
But um,

5784
02:54:59,920 --> 02:55:02,310
that's because of the stupid
daylight savings nonsense,

5785
02:55:02,350 --> 02:55:03,220
whatever it is.

5786
02:55:03,440 --> 02:55:04,190
But by,

5787
02:55:04,190 --> 02:55:04,911
by regardless,

5788
02:55:04,911 --> 02:55:05,211
it's like,

5789
02:55:05,211 --> 02:55:06,530
it's always a question of contrast.

5790
02:55:06,531 --> 02:55:10,790
It's like the good is
better relative to the bad.

5791
02:55:11,060 --> 02:55:11,490
Right,

5792
02:55:11,490 --> 02:55:12,020
right.

5793
02:55:12,020 --> 02:55:13,460
It's a,

5794
02:55:13,790 --> 02:55:14,501
you,

5795
02:55:14,501 --> 02:55:16,040
you need the bad to have the good,

5796
02:55:16,041 --> 02:55:16,510
you need to,

5797
02:55:16,510 --> 02:55:17,690
sad to have to happy.

5798
02:55:18,140 --> 02:55:20,120
That's the idea of being a human being.

5799
02:55:20,130 --> 02:55:20,810
Yeah.

5800
02:55:20,810 --> 02:55:22,190
The question is,

5801
02:55:22,250 --> 02:55:27,250
will we ever evolve and grow to the
point where that is not necessary.

5802
02:55:28,220 --> 02:55:32,540
And would the universal blind
in that aided by technology,

5803
02:55:32,570 --> 02:55:35,120
would that be the facilitator
of that new mindset?

5804
02:55:35,121 --> 02:55:36,680
So in that scenario,

5805
02:55:36,681 --> 02:55:37,640
is there a motion?

5806
02:55:37,910 --> 02:55:38,780
That's a good question.

5807
02:55:38,840 --> 02:55:39,530
There can't be,

5808
02:55:39,530 --> 02:55:40,363
that might not be,

5809
02:55:40,410 --> 02:55:41,243
it might not be sex.

5810
02:55:41,510 --> 02:55:44,390
I've always said that about
robots or about a rather aliens.

5811
02:55:44,570 --> 02:55:46,100
When you look at aliens or do they have,

5812
02:55:46,101 --> 02:55:46,911
they have no muscle.

5813
02:55:46,911 --> 02:55:47,960
They have no sex organs.

5814
02:55:47,961 --> 02:55:48,441
Big heads,

5815
02:55:48,441 --> 02:55:49,274
no rounds.

5816
02:55:49,340 --> 02:55:53,630
Like maybe it mean maybe they've found
a replacement that's better than sex.

5817
02:55:53,631 --> 02:55:54,230
Yeah.

5818
02:55:54,230 --> 02:55:57,140
The real alien is just the
brain hooked up to something.

5819
02:55:57,141 --> 02:55:57,974
Right.

5820
02:55:58,070 --> 02:55:58,730
It's not even,

5821
02:55:58,730 --> 02:56:00,290
there's no physicality at all.

5822
02:56:00,560 --> 02:56:00,890
Right.

5823
02:56:00,890 --> 02:56:02,150
Well maybe that's what it is.

5824
02:56:02,151 --> 02:56:05,840
Maybe it's just some sort of artificial
intelligence that it gets downloaded

5825
02:56:05,841 --> 02:56:09,110
into a body and the only thing that's
necessary is it the body has fingers that

5826
02:56:09,111 --> 02:56:11,030
can articulate and move in a certain way.

5827
02:56:11,270 --> 02:56:11,930
Yeah.

5828
02:56:11,930 --> 02:56:13,040
Matrix type shit.

5829
02:56:13,370 --> 02:56:17,630
I saw an article making the rounds on
my Twitter about how people are getting,

5830
02:56:17,631 --> 02:56:18,464
um,

5831
02:56:18,770 --> 02:56:21,230
neck problems from their smartphones.

5832
02:56:21,320 --> 02:56:21,831
Oh yeah.

5833
02:56:21,831 --> 02:56:22,640
Looking down,

5834
02:56:22,640 --> 02:56:24,320
looking down and the uh,

5835
02:56:24,470 --> 02:56:26,810
how posture and the weight of the head,

5836
02:56:27,410 --> 02:56:32,150
the amount that the cervical spine has
to hold up beyond what it was designed to

5837
02:56:32,151 --> 02:56:36,590
do and the like drastic number
of consequences because of that.

5838
02:56:36,710 --> 02:56:37,543
Oh yeah.

5839
02:56:37,580 --> 02:56:38,413
Uh,

5840
02:56:38,690 --> 02:56:43,430
and it really makes you wonder like the
sedentary lifestyle that everybody works

5841
02:56:43,431 --> 02:56:44,264
on a computer.

5842
02:56:44,330 --> 02:56:47,680
Like who the fuck what profession
doesn't require a computer?

5843
02:56:47,690 --> 02:56:49,400
Smart phone number,

5844
02:56:49,401 --> 02:56:50,234
Jack.

5845
02:56:50,550 --> 02:56:51,081
All right,

5846
02:56:51,081 --> 02:56:51,860
so lumberjack,

5847
02:56:51,860 --> 02:56:52,693
you're safe.

5848
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:54,170
But the vast majority,

5849
02:56:54,171 --> 02:56:59,171
especially in the expanding sectors are
required to interface in a weird way

5850
02:57:00,951 --> 02:57:04,160
with a monitor and in
a posture that is not,

5851
02:57:04,790 --> 02:57:05,810
is not a,

5852
02:57:05,840 --> 02:57:07,270
our bodies weren't designed for.

5853
02:57:07,280 --> 02:57:08,990
So that's why we started
using these chairs.

5854
02:57:09,140 --> 02:57:09,690
Ash,

5855
02:57:09,690 --> 02:57:10,431
road depot,

5856
02:57:10,431 --> 02:57:10,820
cherish.

5857
02:57:10,820 --> 02:57:13,770
I still feel like didn't fix me at all
because I've been doing this the last

5858
02:57:13,800 --> 02:57:15,740
time that is better than the slump.

5859
02:57:15,920 --> 02:57:18,170
Like you're leaning forward
and supporting yourself.

5860
02:57:18,171 --> 02:57:22,130
Like your elbows on the table is bad in
other thing they do is they have these

5861
02:57:22,131 --> 02:57:27,131
chair or these tables rather that you
stand and they stand with standing desks.

5862
02:57:27,141 --> 02:57:27,520
I have,

5863
02:57:27,520 --> 02:57:28,010
I have one.

5864
02:57:28,010 --> 02:57:28,820
A motorized one.

5865
02:57:28,820 --> 02:57:28,911
Yeah.

5866
02:57:28,911 --> 02:57:29,744
We just got one,

5867
02:57:30,120 --> 02:57:32,600
Ergo depot.com they send us these chairs,

5868
02:57:32,601 --> 02:57:32,930
right?

5869
02:57:32,930 --> 02:57:33,930
They sent us the desk.

5870
02:57:34,130 --> 02:57:35,780
They might be the same
guys who sent me the desk.

5871
02:57:35,781 --> 02:57:36,770
I'm not 100% sure.

5872
02:57:38,120 --> 02:57:39,740
Is it a Jarvis Jarvis task?

5873
02:57:40,470 --> 02:57:41,181
No,

5874
02:57:41,181 --> 02:57:42,680
I don't think mine is called a vert desk.

5875
02:57:42,710 --> 02:57:43,880
Do these chairs and the shit.

5876
02:57:44,320 --> 02:57:46,550
I was using this other
one that's Sally chair,

5877
02:57:46,551 --> 02:57:48,620
but it hurt my balls and really?

5878
02:57:48,621 --> 02:57:48,990
Yeah it was,

5879
02:57:48,990 --> 02:57:50,660
it's like it's split down the middle.

5880
02:57:50,661 --> 02:57:52,100
I think my ball was still hurt from that.

5881
02:57:53,220 --> 02:57:54,053
It's not good,

5882
02:57:54,140 --> 02:57:55,370
but this one's much better.

5883
02:57:55,400 --> 02:58:00,400
But even with all the equipment and
stuff for us to like adjust our into

5884
02:58:01,471 --> 02:58:02,010
working,

5885
02:58:02,010 --> 02:58:03,650
still not natural and,

5886
02:58:03,670 --> 02:58:06,630
and it seems to be continuing
to progress in that direction.

5887
02:58:07,050 --> 02:58:08,010
So you have to wonder.

5888
02:58:08,250 --> 02:58:08,640
It could,

5889
02:58:08,640 --> 02:58:08,700
it,

5890
02:58:08,700 --> 02:58:10,290
could there be a physical,

5891
02:58:10,830 --> 02:58:11,490
uh,

5892
02:58:11,490 --> 02:58:13,080
what's the opposite of evolution?

5893
02:58:13,890 --> 02:58:18,890
Devolving devolving could be physical
devolvement and then if you extrapolate

5894
02:58:19,111 --> 02:58:20,550
that and push it way out,

5895
02:58:20,910 --> 02:58:22,430
then it all all of a sudden becomes the,

5896
02:58:22,500 --> 02:58:22,981
the,

5897
02:58:22,981 --> 02:58:23,191
the,

5898
02:58:23,191 --> 02:58:23,970
the body is a,

5899
02:58:23,970 --> 02:58:24,810
is a problem.

5900
02:58:24,811 --> 02:58:26,310
Like the body is just in the way,

5901
02:58:26,370 --> 02:58:28,620
or this could be an
immediate intermediate step.

5902
02:58:28,670 --> 02:58:29,040
Yeah.

5903
02:58:29,040 --> 02:58:32,280
In some new technology that doesn't
require you to be at a desk or look at a

5904
02:58:32,281 --> 02:58:32,750
phone.

5905
02:58:32,750 --> 02:58:32,900
Oh,

5906
02:58:32,900 --> 02:58:33,721
I have some sort of,

5907
02:58:33,721 --> 02:58:37,670
so we can protect the physique
or whether you're your frame now,

5908
02:58:37,680 --> 02:58:38,161
just your,

5909
02:58:38,161 --> 02:58:38,490
your own,

5910
02:58:38,490 --> 02:58:39,420
your body itself.

5911
02:58:39,620 --> 02:58:39,990
Yeah.

5912
02:58:39,990 --> 02:58:41,580
Sitting is the new smoking,

5913
02:58:42,410 --> 02:58:43,350
is that what they say?

5914
02:58:43,351 --> 02:58:43,950
You haven't heard that?

5915
02:58:43,950 --> 02:58:44,370
No.

5916
02:58:44,370 --> 02:58:44,581
Yeah,

5917
02:58:44,581 --> 02:58:45,414
that's what they say.

5918
02:58:45,460 --> 02:58:46,293
I can hear.

5919
02:58:46,380 --> 02:58:47,760
I can imagine them saying that.

5920
02:58:47,790 --> 02:58:48,540
Did we're out of time.

5921
02:58:48,540 --> 02:58:49,200
Oh really?

5922
02:58:49,200 --> 02:58:50,130
We did three hours.

5923
02:58:50,190 --> 02:58:52,300
Just rock goodbye every time.

5924
02:58:52,760 --> 02:58:53,400
Every time.

5925
02:58:53,400 --> 02:58:54,000
Dude.

5926
02:58:54,000 --> 02:58:54,630
Like that.

5927
02:58:54,630 --> 02:58:55,170
Awesome.

5928
02:58:55,170 --> 02:58:56,790
Unbox therapy on Twitter,

5929
02:58:57,030 --> 02:58:58,800
unbox therapy on youtube.

5930
02:58:58,801 --> 02:58:59,161

5931
02:58:59,161 --> 02:58:59,700
you're the shit.

5932
02:58:59,700 --> 02:59:00,533
Thank you my friend.

5933
02:59:00,750 --> 02:59:02,670
Always good to talk to you and sit down.

5934
02:59:03,390 --> 02:59:04,320
Get a new perspective.

5935
02:59:04,650 --> 02:59:05,311
Unbox therapy.

5936
02:59:05,311 --> 02:59:06,144
You fucks.

5937
02:59:06,150 --> 02:59:06,983
Go follow him.

5938
02:59:07,050 --> 02:59:08,970
Enjoy your life and a don't rape anybody.

5939
02:59:09,390 --> 02:59:09,930
See you soon.

5940
02:59:09,930 --> 02:59:10,250
Bye.

5941
02:59:10,250 --> 02:59:11,083
Later.

5942
02:59:26,220 --> 02:59:26,430
Negative.
