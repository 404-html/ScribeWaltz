1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,990
Lakes. Winter. All right. We're
live. All right. Yeah. Nice
to meet you, man. You too.

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:08,640
Um, I knew of you as an actor, uh,
and I knew of your work as a director,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,880
but, uh, I didn't know that
you were into serious shit,

4
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:15,300
like this deep web documentary.
This is really fascinating.

5
00:00:15,301 --> 00:00:17,190
I was watching it just
before you got here,

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,510
so it's all fresh and crackling in
my mind. Cool. And um, first of all,

7
00:00:21,511 --> 00:00:22,440
how'd you get involved in this?

8
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,660
Uh, well it's a couple of
things. One is, first of all,

9
00:00:25,661 --> 00:00:29,500
it's great to be on the show and that
big fan for a long time, but uh, uh,

10
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:34,840
I uh, got online pretty heavily
in the sort of late eighties,

11
00:00:34,841 --> 00:00:38,440
early nineties, and in what was
known as the bbs use net era.

12
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,880
And in those days you,
uh,

13
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,770
I was really interested in sort
of burgeoning online communities,

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,150
people who were the sort of the growth of,
of Internet based communities.

15
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,710
And in those days you could get on and
you would sort of create sort of clubs or

16
00:00:53,711 --> 00:00:57,520
groups or rooms as they were called
with all kinds of likeminded people.

17
00:00:57,521 --> 00:01:00,810
And then you started finding all
kinds of stuff that was going on. Uh,

18
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,880
and it wasn't by any means just
illegal stuff. It was just,

19
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:08,410
it was sort of rarefied,
specialized, whatever. Politics,

20
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,350
activism,
people who are interested in drugs,

21
00:01:11,351 --> 00:01:13,140
people who are interested in sort of,
you know,

22
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,070
pushing boundaries and
all these different ways.

23
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:18,280
And at that point I discovered encryption,
uh,

24
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,250
people who are using the Internet
for anonymity and privacy.

25
00:01:21,251 --> 00:01:23,300
Some of them were like,
parts of, you know,

26
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,590
self help groups are like rape counseling,
any number of things.

27
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:30,730
It was also people who were selling drugs.
So I first encountered the drug,

28
00:01:30,731 --> 00:01:33,730
the online drug markets,
and probably 90 91.

29
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:37,600
And that's when I first
discovered encrypted emails
or to this whole notion of

30
00:01:37,601 --> 00:01:42,280
like people who really were building
encryption technologies for a number of

31
00:01:42,281 --> 00:01:44,260
reasons.
And so I found that interesting.

32
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:48,010
And I spent some years
working on the Napster story.

33
00:01:48,011 --> 00:01:52,390
I made a doc about the rise and fall
of Napster called downloaded. Uh,

34
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,740
and I met Fannick,

35
00:01:53,741 --> 00:01:58,390
Shawn fanning and Sean Parker back in
2000 when Nafta was being decimated,

36
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,730
shot at by all sides. And, uh,

37
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,140
I set out about telling their story that
took me a while to get done and made.

38
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:10,590
But I'd met a lot of people in the
technology sector working on that movie,

39
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:15,730
both and kind of the public
face of technology and the
sort of privacy anonymity

40
00:02:15,731 --> 00:02:20,380
side, the sort of hackers,
activists, crypto cryptographers. So

41
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,790
it was one of the things that I've
found interesting about the documentary

42
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:25,350
initially is that it wasn't,

43
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:30,380
it's Silk Road wasn't necessarily for
folks who don't know it's Silkroad is silk

44
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,440
road is this website that was taken down
by the government because people were

45
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,610
exchanging,

46
00:02:38,611 --> 00:02:42,420
buying and selling illegal drugs from
it and amongst other things that are

47
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,880
illegal. Um, but it,

48
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:47,700
it was more of a community
it seems than anything.

49
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,790
I've had a message board on my website
since 1998 and it's got millions of posts

50
00:02:54,031 --> 00:02:57,630
and it's, it's, it's just this
weird community of likeminded,

51
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,230
odd human beings and a lot of really
fascinating, intelligent human beings.

52
00:03:02,231 --> 00:03:06,160
And I've had some really great
exchanges and interactions with them.

53
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:11,161
And what I really got from what they were
saying in the documentary was like the

54
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:16,390
community that they had created was in
many ways like better than any community,

55
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:18,130
any of them knew in real life.

56
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,710
So it was much more than just
drugs are being sold there.

57
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:26,470
We have to shut it down.
Was like if drugs were being sold there,

58
00:03:26,471 --> 00:03:28,630
it was a small part of what
that thing was all about.

59
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,210
Yeah.
I think that's,

60
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,360
I think that's true and I think that
that's a very hard thing for people to

61
00:03:33,361 --> 00:03:35,490
understand. You know? And if you're not,

62
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,240
like you're saying or you
got online at that point, um,

63
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,890
and you started to see in those days,

64
00:03:40,891 --> 00:03:44,430
like in the late nineties that the
communities are beginning to grow on the

65
00:03:44,431 --> 00:03:46,140
Internet.
And they were really interesting.

66
00:03:46,141 --> 00:03:47,910
And like I remember we're talking
to Shawn fanning about this,

67
00:03:47,911 --> 00:03:51,450
that his biggest regret about the downfall
of Napster was not that the service

68
00:03:51,451 --> 00:03:54,510
got taken online, but that the
community got scattered. You know,

69
00:03:54,511 --> 00:03:55,530
because it was this,

70
00:03:55,531 --> 00:03:59,760
when I discovered Napster and 99 what
blew my mind about it wasn't about,

71
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,020
I mean music was interesting,

72
00:04:01,021 --> 00:04:02,970
but it wasn't about the music
was about the community.

73
00:04:02,971 --> 00:04:06,630
It was like meeting all these people
we were communicating in real time.

74
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,050
What had changed before then
was really kind of cumbersome.

75
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,750
The message boards you're talking
about in the late nineties,

76
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,920
now I'm like in real time with some guy
in Russia, China, Germany, whatever.

77
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,110
And they're in my hard drive.
I'm in their hard drive.

78
00:04:19,111 --> 00:04:21,120
It just got kicked to
this whole other level.

79
00:04:21,121 --> 00:04:23,700
And then you're talking about 100
million people on the internet at once.

80
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,270
A lot of people didn't look at Napster
as a community and they still don't.

81
00:04:27,271 --> 00:04:30,990
They just can't get past the piracy
issue in their minds. Uh, were demeaning.

82
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,580
Nafta wasn't, uh, wasn't created for file
sharing, was created to build community.

83
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:36,690
The Silk Road.

84
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:41,280
In this case you have a manifesto cause
you had like all these people who built

85
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,350
and created the thing who were
writing all these manifestos.

86
00:04:43,351 --> 00:04:48,351
So it was very evident that the Silk Road
was created for this political kind of

87
00:04:48,571 --> 00:04:51,180
movement, this communal movement,
that that was its agenda.

88
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,890
The Napster thing is
interesting because Napster,

89
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,860
although it was a file sharing program,

90
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:03,040
the community that was attached
to it, what the idea was, I, I,

91
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,990
I think about all of
this file sharing stuff.

92
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,820
My feeling on it and my feeling from
being connected to the Internet was like,

93
00:05:10,821 --> 00:05:14,840
we're entering this
entirely new era of art,

94
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:18,680
of digital stuff,
digital creations where it's,

95
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:22,480
this is going to be slippery. You're
not going to be able to just like he,

96
00:05:22,481 --> 00:05:25,580
you know, this guy stole a
thousand cds and copied them.

97
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:30,620
We found his CD copier and we know, you
know, that this guy's making illegal,

98
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:35,540
you know, uh, uh, what were
those a bootleg cds. I mean,

99
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:39,560
we used to have those in New York City.
Sure. Yeah. All the VHS tapes, you know,

100
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,080
of movies that had just come out and
this was a different thing. Yeah.

101
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,970
This is like the actual digital
and that everybody was like, oh,

102
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:49,640
what do you do about that?
Like, oh, there's a, a program.

103
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:54,140
And you could just download these things
and anybody can upload them and then

104
00:05:54,141 --> 00:05:55,770
download them.
And then how are you gonna stop?

105
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,520
Yeah, it's, and it's
true that it's slippery.

106
00:05:58,521 --> 00:06:01,370
And that's why I like telling these
stories is it isn't black and white people

107
00:06:01,371 --> 00:06:04,250
had, their brains can't really
handle it. Sometimes they just,

108
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,170
they want to go to one side of the,

109
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,660
of the issue in the way they see
it in their mind or the other.

110
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:10,820
And they don't have,
for whatever reason,

111
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,950
the capacity to stay in
the gray in the middle.

112
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:15,880
And the stories are always about what's
going on in the gray because it's silk

113
00:06:15,881 --> 00:06:19,490
road is the same thing. You know,
you can say, this is really bad.

114
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:20,390
This is drugs online.

115
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:23,090
This is flouting the law and all
this stuff that you got one side,

116
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,180
the predominant side or were there,
you've got the other side.

117
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,750
The radical alternative to
that would be to say, yeah,

118
00:06:29,751 --> 00:06:34,490
but the drug war is a complete failure.
It's been four decades of destructive. Um,

119
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,220
you know,

120
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:39,230
it's mostly about putting nonviolent
minority offenders in prison by the

121
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:43,040
millions and it's killing people and
it's not helping people who need help in

122
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:47,690
the drug world. It's making the drug
issues criminal and not about health.

123
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,460
Um,

124
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:51,470
and you've got those people over there
who are saying this is all good and you

125
00:06:51,471 --> 00:06:55,400
got all this room in the
middle, the slippery reality,
which is just as you said,

126
00:06:55,401 --> 00:06:57,380
I agree with that perspective.

127
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,220
This is a really big moment
in human history, right?

128
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:03,290
It's too big for most of us
to wrap our heads around.

129
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:05,510
These are huge changes that are afoot,
you know,

130
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:09,530
but what Napster represented
wasn't a couple of kids who
wanted to create piracy.

131
00:07:09,531 --> 00:07:13,610
Whether you can accept that reality or
not, it's true. You may not like it.

132
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:17,270
You may feel like the end result of
what they did caused x, Y, and z.

133
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,930
But the reality is, is there
their minds, their, their visions,

134
00:07:21,931 --> 00:07:23,660
their goals were way beyond that.

135
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,050
And we're still not in the
future that those guys saw.

136
00:07:27,051 --> 00:07:31,310
We're still kind of back in the back
and let's look at what we're seeing with

137
00:07:31,311 --> 00:07:32,390
title and other service.

138
00:07:32,391 --> 00:07:37,390
People are still trying to wrench the
world back to where it was before Napster

139
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:40,790
or they're still trying to sort of undo
the changes that have happened because

140
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:41,780
it's scary,
right?

141
00:07:41,781 --> 00:07:46,130
But we probably will end up in a world
in the next 10 2030 years has drug laws

142
00:07:46,131 --> 00:07:50,000
become more relaxed in the mandatory
minimums, start getting lowered.

143
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:54,320
Where we do see on let legitimate online
drug services are going to become,

144
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,590
they're not going to go
away. They're going to stick
around. Just like, you know,

145
00:07:57,591 --> 00:07:58,820
file sharing.
You didn't go anywhere.

146
00:07:58,821 --> 00:08:03,110
And my guess is that it probably will
be somewhat the norm down the road and

147
00:08:03,111 --> 00:08:04,370
we'll look back at this time and go,
wow,

148
00:08:04,371 --> 00:08:09,371
this thing we thought was so hardcore
actually was a very messy sort of movement

149
00:08:10,431 --> 00:08:14,330
towards where we needed to get to or
towards the future will towards freedom.

150
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:14,991
You know?
I mean,

151
00:08:14,991 --> 00:08:17,780
I'm one of the ones that thinks
that there should be no drug laws.

152
00:08:17,781 --> 00:08:21,350
I think as long as alcohol's legal and
as long as he can get a prescription for

153
00:08:21,351 --> 00:08:22,130
Oxycontin,

154
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:26,630
it's completely ridiculous to lock people
up for mushrooms or the lock people up

155
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:31,430
for pot or what it name your drug
pot being the most innocuous,

156
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:34,420
evolve them and changing
daily as far as the,

157
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,880
the way it's the way it's
treated by law enforcement.

158
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:42,560
But I think the digital world, um,
that you're, you're dealing with WIC,

159
00:08:42,561 --> 00:08:44,900
with Napster or with,
uh,

160
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,220
with the Silk Road is this
world of connectivity.

161
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:53,030
And that's the big change.
It's not just the,

162
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,100
the things that are being exchanged,
it's the,

163
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,400
it's the way that people
can talk to people. The,

164
00:08:58,401 --> 00:09:02,940
the information can go so quickly now
and these communities can form and they

165
00:09:02,941 --> 00:09:05,670
can say, yeah, I've, I've always
thought these laws are bullshit.

166
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:10,670
Like the explain to me why alcohol is
legal and marijuana's not explained to me

167
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,040
why it's stealing to take a record that
you paid for and share it with a bunch

168
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:21,240
of people. It's, I had Paul Stanley on the
podcast from kiss and he's a great guy.

169
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,800
I really enjoyed talking to him,

170
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:28,020
but he's got this sort of really
archaic idea of stealing that,

171
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:31,470
you know, you didn't pay for it.
It's stealing, but it's your,

172
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:36,330
your copies still there. Yeah. You
know, like it's, it's a different thing.

173
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,360
It's not like someone stole your car,
right. Like, and they try to make that,

174
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,690
that sort of comparison. Yes. You
know, if someone stole your car,

175
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:46,200
they stole your car, right. That's, that
was your car. And now they have a bull.

176
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:49,500
If they just copied my car, why do I
give a shit? Yeah, exactly. You know?

177
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,150
You know what I mean?
If you just press a button,

178
00:09:51,151 --> 00:09:53,490
if you see someone driving down the
street and say, I love that car,

179
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,140
let me just press a button and my three
d computer or my three d printer makes

180
00:09:58,141 --> 00:10:03,090
it an exact duplicate of that car. Does
that somehow or another diminish my car?

181
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,820
I don't. It's scary territory.
Right. I mean, people,

182
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:09,210
people don't understand the technology.
They don't agree with the movements.

183
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,500
You know? I think that people
look at technology. I had
a long talk with a, a very,

184
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,330
very important reporter from
a major publication that
Dolan and name and I spent

185
00:10:18,331 --> 00:10:21,840
a really long time trying to explain to
her how the deep web worked and why it

186
00:10:21,841 --> 00:10:23,610
was like no different than
the door on your bathroom.

187
00:10:23,611 --> 00:10:27,000
Like just because there an area of the
Internet that's private and anonymous

188
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,390
doesn't mean it's bad. Just like you're
not bad because you go to the bathroom,

189
00:10:30,391 --> 00:10:32,550
you close the door, and now when
you close the door to your bathroom,

190
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:36,540
you may open the lid and go to
the bathroom or you may shoot up.

191
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,220
I don't know what you're doing in there.
Right.

192
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,590
But that doesn't give me a right
to take the door off your bathroom.

193
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,680
You know what I mean? It's just
about anonymity. We as human beings,

194
00:10:43,681 --> 00:10:47,640
we deserve privacy in an anonymity.
It's a basic human right. However,

195
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:51,690
most people go deep web bad. They just
go right there. It's just, it's bad.

196
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:55,860
It's filled with creeps is filled with
child with pedophiles and drug dealers

197
00:10:55,861 --> 00:10:58,730
and it's all bad and we should
shut it down and would Napster.

198
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,280
We saw the same thing where to this day
people are still like, oh, I'm really,

199
00:11:02,281 --> 00:11:05,220
really feel guilty that I downloaded
that album. It's like I don't,

200
00:11:05,221 --> 00:11:07,160
it was one of the greatest
moments of my life that,

201
00:11:07,161 --> 00:11:11,910
that the walls of culture for this brief
moment just completely came down and

202
00:11:11,911 --> 00:11:14,010
it's like I didn't become
a thief. I've, you know,

203
00:11:14,011 --> 00:11:18,240
I buy lots of music and you know,
I've continued to make a lot of purchases,

204
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,460
but it was an incredible time.

205
00:11:20,461 --> 00:11:24,000
You were getting music you could never
hear anywhere else stuff that wasn't

206
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,330
recorded.
You know,

207
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:28,140
I was turning people on to stuff
because it was so democratized.

208
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:31,760
I was like going back like I had to
like stop liking Bob Dylan like along,

209
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:34,470
I just was like, thought Dylan was
kind of overrated or something.

210
00:11:34,471 --> 00:11:38,940
And then because of Napster I just could
listen to anything so easily that my

211
00:11:38,941 --> 00:11:42,810
own judgment kind of dissipated and I
found myself reconnecting to stuff that I

212
00:11:42,811 --> 00:11:47,130
hadn't really appreciated. So the
point is, is no, it wasn't bad,

213
00:11:47,131 --> 00:11:51,840
but it did certainly ramp
ahead of existing laws and
businesses that are still

214
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:53,800
trying to catch up.
And the is,

215
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,760
we need new business models that work
with these new technologies that doesn't

216
00:11:57,761 --> 00:11:59,620
make those technologies bad.
Well,

217
00:11:59,621 --> 00:12:03,760
everybody got addicted to selling that
music at exorbitant rates. I mean,

218
00:12:03,761 --> 00:12:05,310
that's really what happened,
especially the,

219
00:12:05,311 --> 00:12:09,550
the record companies and the record
companies are notoriously shitty with the

220
00:12:09,551 --> 00:12:12,580
artists. I mean the, the
contracts and when you read them,

221
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:16,390
you ever read the Courtney love
breakdown? Yeah. Yeah. It's amazing. Yeah.

222
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,810
And if you read that, you
go, fuck man. Or what's the,

223
00:12:19,811 --> 00:12:24,770
Jared Leto won that, the documentary that
he did, in fact, what's it called? The,

224
00:12:24,771 --> 00:12:27,490
the documentary's called artifact.
Yeah. It's about his band.

225
00:12:27,491 --> 00:12:30,310
And their battles is great.
It's a, it's a crazy,

226
00:12:30,311 --> 00:12:34,810
creepy fucking business that is losing
its legs and they're scrambling along the

227
00:12:34,811 --> 00:12:35,644
way.

228
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:40,710
And I think that that's one of the big
pushes pushes the big push backs because

229
00:12:40,931 --> 00:12:45,070
of the commerce aspect of it. Right. But
as far as the information aspect of it,

230
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:49,330
what you brought up about the bathroom
is a really good point because how come

231
00:12:49,331 --> 00:12:53,140
you can have a private club?
Like you could have a club where you,

232
00:12:53,141 --> 00:12:55,600
you and your friends go to play poker,
whatever.

233
00:12:55,601 --> 00:12:59,140
You rent out an office somewhere
and it's yours. You lock the door,

234
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:03,040
you bring in booze, you have fun, you
play the music, you like to listen to.

235
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,230
When you guys have a good time.
Does everyone,

236
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:08,440
there's the cops I think going
to fucking just scan the door.

237
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:11,590
Are they going to put a bug inside the
room to make sure you're not doing any

238
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,010
habit? You close called your cell
phone. I know, but isn't that amazing?

239
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:18,010
Like that's the same thing.
I mean a physical room,

240
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,200
a physical room that you have,

241
00:13:20,201 --> 00:13:24,190
that's a club house that's been going
around since the beginning of time. Yeah.

242
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:28,180
No one has a problem with that. That's a
normal part of human beings. But uh, uh,

243
00:13:28,181 --> 00:13:31,840
private digital room where your
physical body isn't even there,

244
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:36,310
that becomes problematic.
Yeah. And scarier than that,
I think it is that, you know,

245
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,990
now there is such a,

246
00:13:37,991 --> 00:13:41,230
such a direct link between the physical
space in the digital space, meaning,

247
00:13:41,231 --> 00:13:41,471
you know,

248
00:13:41,471 --> 00:13:45,910
there's the Supreme Court recently passed
a law that doesn't allow officers to

249
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:50,470
uh, go into your cell phone without a
warrant on a search of basic search and

250
00:13:50,471 --> 00:13:52,660
seizure. Right? So your cell phone,

251
00:13:52,661 --> 00:13:55,320
thinking about what that connects to
that connects to your bank account and

252
00:13:55,321 --> 00:13:58,720
connects to your medical records,
it connects to photographs of your wife,

253
00:13:58,721 --> 00:14:01,960
your kids, whatever. I mean,
that's not your digital life,

254
00:14:01,961 --> 00:14:06,220
that's just your life period. So of
course you do. Of course there has to be,

255
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:09,430
you know, technology's in place
to keep you protected and private.

256
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,680
And look what happened to those actresses,
you know,

257
00:14:11,681 --> 00:14:14,500
that were exploited through the
four Chan fattening where their,

258
00:14:14,501 --> 00:14:19,360
their photographs were taken off of the
iCloud and sold on four Chan. And it was,

259
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,390
you know, extremely intimate
pictures and people say to me,

260
00:14:22,391 --> 00:14:25,360
this one journalist I was talking to,
it was trying to wrap her head around.

261
00:14:25,361 --> 00:14:28,120
It said, well what if I get hackers?
Like, this is what you don't understand,

262
00:14:28,121 --> 00:14:31,360
you've already been hacked.
All your information is out there.

263
00:14:31,361 --> 00:14:35,080
It's just a question of whether someone
decides to exploit it or not. You know,

264
00:14:35,081 --> 00:14:38,350
your social security number, your
medical records, your life is out there.

265
00:14:38,351 --> 00:14:42,760
So we need to be able to be protected
and right now there's this battle to

266
00:14:42,761 --> 00:14:46,510
remove protections and what we need to
be doing is actually implementing more

267
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,090
protections.
It,

268
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,550
it seems like to me that when
the world becomes digital

269
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,480
and then digital
information, the, the, the,

270
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,910
those ones and Zeros become accessible.

271
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:03,890
We're going to get to a point in time
where privacy seems ridiculous. Yeah.

272
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,701
And that's it.

273
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:09,320
It sounds so crazy because 20
years ago it was a hard photograph.

274
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:09,771
You know,

275
00:15:09,771 --> 00:15:13,280
someone had to come over your house to
look at your photo album and now your

276
00:15:13,281 --> 00:15:15,590
photo album isn't even in your phone.

277
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:20,860
It's on the cloud and upload to it and
it's going to get weirder from there with

278
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,630
the new technology that we don't even,

279
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:27,080
we can't even predict the
20 year from now technology,

280
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,930
but it's going to get more and more
bizarre to the point where we're going to

281
00:15:29,931 --> 00:15:30,620
have,

282
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:35,620
we're going to have to have
a real restructuring of
what we expect in terms of

283
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,170
privacy, personal
sovereignty, what, you know,

284
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:43,520
what do you expect from
your fellow citizens? Yeah,

285
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,470
because we're going to,
I mean it's almost going to be like,

286
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,670
you're going to have to trust me to
not look at your shit. Right, exactly.

287
00:15:49,671 --> 00:15:52,880
Cause you're, your shit is out there.
Yeah. You know, so what we look at them,

288
00:15:52,881 --> 00:15:56,600
what we done, it's like it's, and we need,
there are ways to have a bathroom door,

289
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,100
but we need to be able to have them.

290
00:15:58,101 --> 00:16:01,310
We need to be able to have encryption
that's baked into our email,

291
00:16:01,311 --> 00:16:06,260
that's baked into our browsers. There
has to be, basically we need to go dark.

292
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:07,130
You know the,

293
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:10,550
what the dark net does is it provides
technologies that allow you to have

294
00:16:10,551 --> 00:16:11,690
privacy and anonymity.

295
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,900
A lot of people are trying to break
those walls down and say they're bad.

296
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:18,920
The truth is we actually need
more of that. We need that
to be pervasive. We need,

297
00:16:18,921 --> 00:16:23,300
we need your browser to
automatically anonymize so it
can't be so easily tracked.

298
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,550
And we're not just talking about the
government, we're talking about hackers,

299
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:28,700
we're talking about people who will
steal your stuff and sell it or use it

300
00:16:28,701 --> 00:16:31,880
against you in some way. So it,
again, it isn't some, you know,

301
00:16:31,881 --> 00:16:35,150
giant anti government thing.
It's a basic right to privacy issue.

302
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,410
And that privacy again is
probably temporary. I mean we're,

303
00:16:39,411 --> 00:16:42,680
when we're looking at 50 years from now,
it's probably going to be hilarious.

304
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:47,080
Yeah. You look back on the idea that
someone couldn't read your email. Yeah.

305
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,940
And you know what? We're already
the, the sad truth is where there,

306
00:16:49,941 --> 00:16:54,590
that's not the technology you're talking
about is here right now. I mean your,

307
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:59,190
your information is transparent to
anyone with half a an ability to,

308
00:16:59,191 --> 00:17:02,690
to handle technologies.
Your laptop, your phone,

309
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:06,950
all of that stuff is accessible to anybody
who's halfway interested in using it.

310
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:11,540
And that was one of the really disturbing
things that was revealed during the

311
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:16,541
whole Edward Snowden incident was that
the government is not just able to tap

312
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:20,720
into your stuff and checking
on you. Hey, this Alex Guy,

313
00:17:20,721 --> 00:17:21,980
he seems a little shifty.

314
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,800
How do you think he might be involved
in some nefarious activities?

315
00:17:24,801 --> 00:17:26,150
Let's look into him.
No,

316
00:17:26,151 --> 00:17:30,890
let's just download everyone's fucking
phone numbers and everyone's emails and

317
00:17:30,891 --> 00:17:35,210
everyone's voice mails and constantly
monitor everything all the time.

318
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:35,991
And by the way,

319
00:17:35,991 --> 00:17:40,991
let's build a huge facility in Utah that
consists of hundreds of trillions of

320
00:17:41,511 --> 00:17:46,040
terabytes of storage and
just store everything. Fuck
it. We'll just store it off.

321
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:49,620
And if Alex starts talking, Shit would
just say, oh yeah, Alex, check this.

322
00:17:49,621 --> 00:17:51,360
And we'd go look at all
these big black dicks.

323
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:54,150
You've been looking at sun and we just
didn't go to you. How did you, Hey,

324
00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:55,430
I'm a fucking talking to me.

325
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,430
And they go and they download all
your stuff and they present it to you.

326
00:17:59,431 --> 00:18:01,200
And they say, look, you
know, you have a choice.

327
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:05,070
Either we can make this public or
we can, you know, fill in the blank,

328
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,450
whatever they would like to get from you.
Yeah.

329
00:18:07,451 --> 00:18:10,680
And what's scary is that what we
recently discovered the last week or so,

330
00:18:10,681 --> 00:18:14,480
there was the revelations that,
you know, it's always been a,

331
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,850
the excuse has always been, you
know, terrorism, the Patriot Act,

332
00:18:17,851 --> 00:18:20,850
it's always been since nine
11 we have to do this because,

333
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:24,330
and what was revealed as they've been
doing this long before nine 11 and it was

334
00:18:24,331 --> 00:18:26,860
mostly because of the drug war.
So it's,

335
00:18:26,861 --> 00:18:30,720
it's kind of commonly known that a lot
of the surveillance implementations that

336
00:18:30,721 --> 00:18:35,160
occurred occurred because of the
drug war. Yeah. Isn't that adorable?

337
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:41,360
The drug war is the thing and it's this
whole drug war is such a joke because

338
00:18:42,301 --> 00:18:46,050
there's not a war on drugs.
It's a lie. It's a flat out lie.

339
00:18:46,051 --> 00:18:49,320
There's no war on drugs.
There never will be a war on drugs.

340
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,990
There will always be drugs.
There's not a war.

341
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:55,770
There's a war on some drugs
and it's not even a war.

342
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,050
It's a mad money grab.

343
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:01,050
It's a mad money grab
from privatized prisons.

344
00:19:01,051 --> 00:19:04,230
It's a mad money grab
from the guard unions,

345
00:19:04,231 --> 00:19:06,870
the prison guard unions
from law enforcement,

346
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,620
from all these people that
profit off drugs being legal.

347
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,120
It has zero to do with public safety.
Zero to do with public health.

348
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:19,990
It's a lie. Yeah. I mean the film goes
into that in detail. So, uh, I mean I,

349
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,640
I totally agree with that
and it, it isn't, you know,

350
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:25,380
to say that we don't need things to be,
you know, we don't need law enforcement,

351
00:19:25,381 --> 00:19:27,870
we don't need certain types of regulation.
But the question is why,

352
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,940
why do we need them and what
purpose are they serving?

353
00:19:29,941 --> 00:19:31,830
And making sure that they
serve an accurate purpose.

354
00:19:31,831 --> 00:19:34,200
But when they're primarily
being used to felonies,

355
00:19:34,201 --> 00:19:36,720
minorities in fill prisons for profit,

356
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:40,770
then you've got something that probably
needs to be changed without a doubt.

357
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:44,820
I mean, and there's, there's
also some talk recently,

358
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,700
and I know some states
have recently passed this.

359
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,820
We're asset forfeiture laws
are being rescinded. Like,

360
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:54,480
you can no longer just steal people
shit because you pulled them over,

361
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,920
they pull you over and say,

362
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,570
what if you were going to buy a car
somewhere and they pull you over and you

363
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,820
Alex, what are you doing with
$5,000 cash? And you're like, oh,

364
00:20:02,821 --> 00:20:06,450
I was going to go buy a car. Can you
prove that we're going to take that?

365
00:20:06,451 --> 00:20:08,910
You're gonna have to prove that in court.
They could take that.

366
00:20:08,911 --> 00:20:12,360
And they were taking it and they
were using it to fund parties.

367
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,840
They bought a fucking Margarita machine,
which is so ironic.

368
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:21,200
They were so serving drugs with money
that they took from people who they

369
00:20:21,691 --> 00:20:25,620
suspected of selling drugs. Yeah.
They just were selling this.

370
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,530
They were just dealing with the
sanction drugs. If they're party,

371
00:20:28,531 --> 00:20:32,520
the sanction Margarita's yeah, it's
human nature. Disgusting. I know,

372
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:36,120
but it's just if you give people law,

373
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,480
like if you write things
down on paper, like you, uh,

374
00:20:39,481 --> 00:20:43,710
you law enforcement officer because of
this thing that's written down his paper,

375
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:47,890
you have the right to take this fellow
human being and put them in a cage

376
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,450
because they've decided to alter their
consciousness in a way that we don't deem

377
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:56,650
to be worthy. Right? Yeah. It's
a hell of a thing. It's retarded,

378
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,830
you know, it does. You
said it allows, you know,

379
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:02,820
people to be arrested for all
kinds of reasons and that's,

380
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:05,860
that's not helpful even to people
who need help who are on drugs.

381
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:11,040
And the parallel with the record
industry is that they're addicted to that

382
00:21:11,321 --> 00:21:15,010
money. They are addicted to
taking that money from people.

383
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:18,250
They're addicted to the private
prisons are addicted to it.

384
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,390
The law enforcement officers are addicted.
There's a real issue with,

385
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:25,810
with drugs in this country in that if
marijuana was made legal, just marijuana,

386
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:30,670
some ungodly number of drug arrests
would no longer be necessary.

387
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,950
And that would make thousands of law
enforcement officers all over the country

388
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:39,730
out of a job. Yeah. And they don't
want that. Nobody wants, I mean, look,

389
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,380
there's a way to do it where they would
be put into a better position in society,

390
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,980
but it wouldn't be locking people
up for a plant. Right? Yup.

391
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,430
And they're addicted to it. They're
addicted to it, and it's a mad scramble.

392
00:21:51,431 --> 00:21:54,760
I mean, it's not the same situation as
what's going on with the record industry.

393
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:59,080
The record industry makes far less
sense to me than the movie industry.

394
00:21:59,081 --> 00:22:01,540
The movie industry makes sense. If you
want to make a movie like the Hobbit,

395
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,360
fuck that taught, that costs
a lot of money. You know?

396
00:22:04,361 --> 00:22:08,350
And if you want to download that God damn
thing for free and you're not going to

397
00:22:08,351 --> 00:22:10,840
go see it in the movie now and they're
not going to get your money right.

398
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:14,170
That to me seems a little bit unfair just
because you're dealing with something

399
00:22:14,171 --> 00:22:17,410
that requires some
exorbitant amount of money.

400
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:20,170
And once you see it at
home on your television,

401
00:22:20,171 --> 00:22:22,180
if you can download it
and play it on your TV,

402
00:22:22,181 --> 00:22:24,430
there's really no reason
to go to the movies. Right.

403
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:29,500
But if you download Paul Stanley Solo
album, you might want to go see him live.

404
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:30,341
Yeah, the, you know,

405
00:22:30,341 --> 00:22:34,420
the hobbits not going to do a live
show in woodland hills anytime soon.

406
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,850
Maybe they'll bring back like
the ice capades still, you know,

407
00:22:36,851 --> 00:22:38,860
like we get that stuff gone again.

408
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:42,100
But I mean it's true except for I
still maintain, like you said earlier,

409
00:22:42,101 --> 00:22:46,990
that pleasant or unpleasant. We're in
a transitional period and the consumer,

410
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:52,270
you can't brand the consumer as being
sort of morally repellent or thieves

411
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:56,590
because they are using a technology that
gives them what they want the way they

412
00:22:56,591 --> 00:22:59,380
want it. It isn't just, it isn't
to them. It isn't about money.

413
00:22:59,381 --> 00:23:03,100
I've always maintained that.
It's like this is really
easy. It's super convenient.

414
00:23:03,101 --> 00:23:07,090
This is, why would I bend myself around
to go like, wait for your window.

415
00:23:07,091 --> 00:23:10,000
Like a hobbit is going to come
out when you know I live here.

416
00:23:10,001 --> 00:23:10,631
I'm not going to get that.

417
00:23:10,631 --> 00:23:12,970
Like all my friends have seen it over
there and I can't see it here. It's like,

418
00:23:12,971 --> 00:23:17,020
no, I'm going to circumvent that because
I want it now. It's like the windowing,

419
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,760
the way in which consumers want.

420
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,580
Their entertainment is changing
because of the way technology works,

421
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,620
no matter what that does
to your business model.

422
00:23:23,621 --> 00:23:27,130
You have to change your business model to
fit what the consumer wants. You can't,

423
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:30,760
you can't just keep branding and pirates
and just staying in the old way of

424
00:23:30,761 --> 00:23:34,300
doing things. Cause if that ship
has sailed, I'm a huge fan of games,

425
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:37,900
game of Thrones, and I haven't seen the
new, the first episode of the new season,

426
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:41,530
but somebody sent me a fucking tweet.
I don't know if you know,

427
00:23:41,531 --> 00:23:45,830
but the first five episodes have
been leaked on mother fuckers.

428
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:50,240
How dare you. Yeah, and but that's
not going to hurt game of Thrones.

429
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:54,200
I'm not going to not have HBO.
Maybe somebody won't,

430
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,280
you know there's going to be shrinkage
because of the change in technologies.

431
00:23:58,281 --> 00:24:00,950
I mean just like, just like the
car replaced the horse and buggy,

432
00:24:00,951 --> 00:24:04,010
just like refrigeration
killed, you know, ice delivery.

433
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,170
It's like the other is it's,

434
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:09,470
it's not to be pollyannish and say
this is all great for everybody.

435
00:24:09,471 --> 00:24:11,840
It's just to be realistic
and say the ship has sailed,

436
00:24:11,841 --> 00:24:14,690
technology is changing the
world and all these ways.

437
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,990
One of them happens to be the
way we listen to music. You know?

438
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:20,870
It's like that's just the
fact of the way we live.

439
00:24:20,871 --> 00:24:25,480
We can't look at our society and blame
them all for being pirates. These, this,

440
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:26,740
this world is evolving.

441
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,510
We have to move with that world
and it is going to be painful.

442
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:33,380
There are going to be casualties, but we
will come out. Okay on the other side.

443
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,910
That's how it's always been that way.

444
00:24:34,911 --> 00:24:38,460
I mean he imagine how pissed
off the blacksmith swore
when cars came along. Yeah.

445
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:42,560
Like dude, my fucking shit. I'm making
horse shoes. That's my shit. Yeah.

446
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:46,630
Nobody wants horse shoes anymore.
But that's a part of the evolution of,

447
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,830
of culture.
Do you know how they fought cars?

448
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,110
The way they fought cars was the same way.

449
00:24:51,111 --> 00:24:55,820
They're fighting the deep web
and the records and the Napster,

450
00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:00,560
they said that cars are bad because you
can't see what's in the trunk and you

451
00:25:00,561 --> 00:25:04,340
can be used to move contraband across
state lines when they tried to use that as

452
00:25:04,341 --> 00:25:08,690
a way to prevent the automobile from
becoming more popularized. So it's,

453
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,720
it's always the same argument that you're
going to do something very bad with

454
00:25:11,721 --> 00:25:12,740
that you can't have it.

455
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:16,880
And of course that was probably going
on during prohibition. Of course,

456
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:21,500
the invention of the car, it was within
a decade or two of that. So yeah,

457
00:25:21,501 --> 00:25:22,820
that's the hope.
I mean they were,

458
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:25,280
they were trying to keep people
from drinking booze. They,

459
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:28,920
I mean they were trying to say,
look, no drugs, no nothing. Yeah.

460
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,460
What a fucked up time.
That must have been.

461
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:35,560
People who want some is so God damn angry.
Yeah. Look what came out of it. Yeah.

462
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:39,500
Fucking Al Capone organized crime to same
shit we're seeing in Mexico right now.

463
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:42,350
The cartels,
all of it comes about.

464
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:46,730
It's like at what point in time to these
dummies not look at history and go,

465
00:25:46,731 --> 00:25:49,460
look, this is going to happen.
History's going to repeat itself.

466
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,400
When you create a vacuum,
it will be filled. Yeah.

467
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:56,810
When you have a desire that people
have undeniable desire to alter their

468
00:25:56,811 --> 00:26:00,050
consciousness and you have a
method that everyone's aware of,

469
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:02,240
but then you deny them
access to that method,

470
00:26:02,241 --> 00:26:04,730
someone's going to provide it for
sure. If they're gonna step in. Yeah,

471
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:09,470
the money's big now. It's just you
look at it on paper, where's the Blas?

472
00:26:09,471 --> 00:26:13,640
Where's the benefit? Like what?
What is the loss to society?

473
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:17,840
Organized crime. That's the
loss. That's the number one.

474
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:23,050
All the murders and the craziness and
the chaos that comes from not from

475
00:26:23,211 --> 00:26:28,190
businesses that you can regulate and
understand and look at their profits and

476
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:31,700
see what their practices are and decide
whether or not you want to boycott this

477
00:26:31,701 --> 00:26:35,150
company as opposed to that company
which behaves more ethically.

478
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:39,970
This company is organic in this company
is self sustaining and look at it. No,

479
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:40,940
it's you're,
you're,

480
00:26:40,941 --> 00:26:45,870
you're making it illegal and you're
creating a organized crime ring.

481
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,170
It's like instantly you're going to
create that and destroying economies.

482
00:26:49,171 --> 00:26:52,830
And I mean, the reverberations
are huge all over the world. Yeah.

483
00:26:52,831 --> 00:26:57,390
And the reverberations I think of just
denying people freedom. There's, there's,

484
00:26:57,391 --> 00:26:58,224
uh, it's, uh,

485
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:03,770
a very deteriorating effect on human
beings when another human being denies a

486
00:27:04,921 --> 00:27:09,600
person of any inalienable right.
You're, you're right to sleep.

487
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:11,760
They'll keep waking you up in
the middle of the night. You get,

488
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,350
you're going to get fucking furious.

489
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,410
They say you can't drink more than a glass
of water a day. Who the fuck are you?

490
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:16,961
There's this,

491
00:27:16,961 --> 00:27:20,920
this thing that people have when someone
tries to keep them from doing something

492
00:27:20,921 --> 00:27:22,290
that doesn't make any sense.
Totally.

493
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:27,060
And talking private on a website
is one of those things. Yeah.

494
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:31,560
And if they're exchanging drugs
and you know, they're selling,

495
00:27:31,561 --> 00:27:33,180
buying and selling drugs,
like wow,

496
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:37,980
that's a minor consequence of freedom.
Yeah.

497
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:39,330
And it's also revolutionary.

498
00:27:39,331 --> 00:27:42,540
It also means that people are trying
to find new ways to do something that

499
00:27:42,541 --> 00:27:46,260
there's going to be easier for them
or more, uh, done in a more healthy,

500
00:27:46,261 --> 00:27:48,330
functional way than the
current way that exists.

501
00:27:48,331 --> 00:27:51,000
And that's what I think is blowing
people's minds because that maybe this

502
00:27:51,001 --> 00:27:53,850
actually is reducing crime and
violence in the street trade.

503
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:56,310
Maybe it is causing a
problem for the cartels.

504
00:27:56,311 --> 00:27:59,640
Maybe it is making it easier for someone
who has a habit to be in a community

505
00:27:59,641 --> 00:28:03,680
that may be able to help them as opposed
to throw them in jail. I mean it's, it's,

506
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,790
there's, it's, and again, it's
not to say these are all good.

507
00:28:05,791 --> 00:28:09,420
It's not to me a black and white issue,
but there was just a lot of gray here.

508
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,810
There's always going to be,
then there's,

509
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:16,260
that's just a part of being a human
being. You know, you give people freedom,

510
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:21,360
they're going to do things that you
might not necessarily agree with. Yeah.

511
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:26,010
I mean, how many people agree with
people tattooing their face? You know,

512
00:28:26,011 --> 00:28:30,150
a lot of people think that's a terrible
choice, but if you make it illegal,

513
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:31,170
you'll probably,

514
00:28:31,171 --> 00:28:33,810
the number of people tattooing their face
would probably go through the roof for

515
00:28:33,811 --> 00:28:38,160
sure. This is no way to stop people
from doing what they want to do.

516
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:41,040
And when you try,
it makes them,

517
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,780
it's just a thing about human beings.
When you want us to not do something,

518
00:28:45,781 --> 00:28:46,860
we ordinarily want to do it.

519
00:28:46,861 --> 00:28:51,270
That's why Catholic school girls were
always so ridiculously promiscuous. Right.

520
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:55,160
Why? Because they're always told like
don't, don't go anywhere near boys. No,

521
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:59,530
I can wait to get here. Like I have
a friend who went to Catholic school,

522
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:01,350
she was just talking about it yesterday.
She was like,

523
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:05,430
everybody in my class was boy crazy
cause there was no boys and they were the

524
00:29:05,431 --> 00:29:06,690
forbidden fruit.
Right.

525
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:10,050
It's like everything their parents
were trying to protect them from.

526
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:14,190
They were just ramping it up. Yeah,
totally. Yeah. There's your motivator.

527
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:17,020
So this was created,
um,

528
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,770
originally the software that was used to,

529
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:23,250
to power the deep rip,

530
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:28,330
the deep web and Silk Road was all
initially used or created for good.

531
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,850
Yeah. And it's still largely
used for good. Again,

532
00:29:32,851 --> 00:29:35,730
you have to think about it like a,
like a city. It's an environment. Like,

533
00:29:35,731 --> 00:29:39,180
if you look at it under a terrarium,
it's just this place now and any city,

534
00:29:39,181 --> 00:29:42,010
you're going to have all kinds
of good stuff going on and you're

535
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,560
going to have bad stuff going on and
you're gonna have everything in between is

536
00:29:44,561 --> 00:29:46,870
literally just a place it gets demonized,

537
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,480
but as no different than
any other environment.

538
00:29:49,481 --> 00:29:53,860
It's just a privacy oriented environment.
It was created by the navy. Torah was,

539
00:29:53,861 --> 00:29:56,270
anyway,
that's one way into the tor.

540
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:01,120
Tor is a browser that anonymizes
meaning, uh, you don't,

541
00:30:01,121 --> 00:30:03,880
no one can track your,
um, your IP address.

542
00:30:03,881 --> 00:30:06,040
No one can see what sites you're visiting.

543
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,950
I use tor like you to
use Amazon for instance,

544
00:30:08,951 --> 00:30:12,220
because it's really easy to get
hacked online using a regular browser.

545
00:30:12,221 --> 00:30:15,850
I don't want my credit card number
being plugged into a regular browser.

546
00:30:15,851 --> 00:30:20,340
So I use tour. If I'm a banking online,
I use tour cause it anonymizes. Um,

547
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,710
it runs through a network that doesn't
allow people to track what you're

548
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,570
inputting into it doesn't
know where you are.

549
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,720
And this is Tori program or a browser,
or is it browser,

550
00:30:28,721 --> 00:30:29,680
but then it goes further than,

551
00:30:29,681 --> 00:30:33,220
that tour also has a component
called tor hidden services,

552
00:30:33,221 --> 00:30:37,360
and that is actually a kind of a separate
internet that operates within the dark

553
00:30:37,361 --> 00:30:42,190
net. And the TOR hidden services don't
end with Dotcom. The end would dot.

554
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:45,600
Dot. Onion tours. Tours stands
for the onion router. It was,

555
00:30:45,601 --> 00:30:49,810
and it was created by the navy primarily
to be used for agents to communicate

556
00:30:49,811 --> 00:30:53,470
with each other anonymously. It's, I mean,
the NSA uses it, law enforcement uses it.

557
00:30:53,471 --> 00:30:56,440
So it's always been used
largely for good to this day,

558
00:30:56,650 --> 00:31:01,220
it's still used by a lot of government
agencies to this day. So it's t o r, yeah.

559
00:31:01,221 --> 00:31:04,740
Yeah. Well, it'd be whatever it is. It'll
be like a string of numbers dot onion, uh,

560
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,990
to get to pull tore down. You just go to,
I think it's toward out org or whatever.

561
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:12,550
You can get that from the Clearnet. The
surface one. Is that restricted? No,

562
00:31:12,551 --> 00:31:14,020
it's totally illegal. I mean, it's, again,

563
00:31:14,021 --> 00:31:17,650
it's used a lot of people who use tor
journalists use it, dissidence, use it.

564
00:31:17,651 --> 00:31:21,250
They're like, you know, rape counseling
organizations that use it. Like, okay,

565
00:31:21,251 --> 00:31:22,960
we're going to do,
we're going to talk online,

566
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:26,230
let's all pull down tour and then
we can get on our forum, you know,

567
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:30,310
in the tor hidden services and you can
feel comfortable talking about being

568
00:31:30,311 --> 00:31:34,240
raped or whatever happens. It's, it's
an anonymized corner of the Internet.

569
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:38,530
And how does it work? Well, I don't want
to bore your, your audience but, but the,

570
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:43,600
it's,
it involves pretty intense math and um,

571
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:45,350
a lot of this stuff grew out of the,

572
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:49,600
the sort of early creators of the
Internet that we're using cryptography and

573
00:31:49,601 --> 00:31:53,590
ways of a bouncing, uh, or rerouting,

574
00:31:53,591 --> 00:31:57,520
it's very similar to a peer to peer
technology where your signal or your input

575
00:31:57,521 --> 00:31:59,620
gets rerouted and bounced
around a bunch of others.

576
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:04,620
So it gets scrambled and then it will
find itself on some other end having gone

577
00:32:05,681 --> 00:32:09,790
through a bunch of other, uh, routers.
Right? So that's how the, the,

578
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:12,660
the sort of surface browser area works.
The,

579
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:15,810
the hidden service is
actually operating within a,

580
00:32:15,811 --> 00:32:17,410
an area of the Internet
called the deep web.

581
00:32:17,411 --> 00:32:21,100
And the deep web is just like
everything online that is an index.

582
00:32:21,101 --> 00:32:22,980
It's basically like looking
under the hood of your car.

583
00:32:22,981 --> 00:32:24,910
It's just all the junk online,

584
00:32:24,911 --> 00:32:29,260
like banks communicating crap to
each other. It's just mostly just,

585
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:30,910
just a code,
right?

586
00:32:30,911 --> 00:32:34,240
That doesn't need to be indexed by Google
cause it's a bunch of code and people

587
00:32:34,241 --> 00:32:38,740
figured out how to get down into that
area and create an actual environment.

588
00:32:38,741 --> 00:32:41,130
So they have have built,
um,

589
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:45,350
space within the deep web that you
can use. You can access through Tor.

590
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:48,380
So it's unindexed so you can't find it by,
by using Google.

591
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:53,000
It never shows up in the surface
web. Whoa. It's pretty interesting.

592
00:32:53,001 --> 00:32:55,160
And it's been there forever.
It's just been growing over time.

593
00:32:55,161 --> 00:32:58,880
And then tor was developed over
the last 15 years or so. Um,

594
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:02,480
but there are other ways to get into
that area as well that are growing.

595
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:05,810
So the problem with that would be,
of course, if someone say like,

596
00:33:05,811 --> 00:33:09,800
if someone was harassing, say an ex
girlfriend or something like that,

597
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:13,460
sending someone threatening messages,
you couldn't track it. Yeah.

598
00:33:13,461 --> 00:33:17,030
But you couldn't if you could because if
I'm sending my ex girlfriend it hidden

599
00:33:17,031 --> 00:33:17,600
messages,

600
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,630
I'd have to be sending them to her on
the surface web or she wouldn't see them.

601
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:21,550
Uh,
you know,

602
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:24,320
I mean unless she's hanging out in the
deep web with me in case what's what she

603
00:33:24,321 --> 00:33:28,400
doing down there and I mean but if like
if I send an email to her through my

604
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:30,620
tour browser to her email address,

605
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:33,980
you're going to f you can track me through
her email address cause she's in the

606
00:33:33,981 --> 00:33:37,180
clear. But that's why it always has to
be an alternative then because honestly,

607
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,050
because if it was like chrome,

608
00:33:39,051 --> 00:33:43,130
if chrome had these type of capabilities
right then someone could harass someone

609
00:33:43,131 --> 00:33:45,410
on Facebook or something like that
and you wouldn't be able to track it.

610
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,151
We are going to get to,

611
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:50,720
this is where it gets into an interesting
gray area because it's a little of

612
00:33:50,721 --> 00:33:52,610
both. There we, we are
going to be building,

613
00:33:52,611 --> 00:33:56,120
there are going to be browser technologies
that do randomize your location.

614
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:00,950
There's already VPN, sort of virtual
networks that, that mask your IP address.

615
00:34:00,951 --> 00:34:04,580
You can use those every day. A
lot of people do. Um, and again,

616
00:34:04,581 --> 00:34:07,130
they're not doing that so they
can hide for doing contraband.

617
00:34:07,131 --> 00:34:10,490
They're doing that to prevent
being hacked most of the time. Um,

618
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,510
and that already will,

619
00:34:11,511 --> 00:34:14,510
will sort of preclude people from
knowing exactly what computer you sent

620
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:18,410
something from. But you know, in
general it's pretty easy to trace.

621
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:22,940
The digital world is a trackable world
and at that, at the end of the day,

622
00:34:22,941 --> 00:34:24,590
usually contract somebody,

623
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:28,880
unless they're in a completely alternative
space talking to someone else who has

624
00:34:28,881 --> 00:34:32,420
willingly joined that alternate space,
then all bets are kind of off.

625
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:37,690
So if you were a member of one of
these communities and you joined up,

626
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:39,350
someone could harass you then.

627
00:34:39,351 --> 00:34:43,520
And there's really not a lot you could
be saying user x, y double d slash zero,

628
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,750
you're a piece of shit.
If they found out who you were though,

629
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:52,320
well then your randomized number.
Yeah, you, you create a user name and,

630
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:55,460
and no one's gonna know who you are in
that space and there's nothing connecting

631
00:34:55,461 --> 00:34:59,070
you to the surface.
But if you reveal who you are in that,

632
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:02,090
then you'd have to get a new randomized
number. Yeah. Which you'd take it.

633
00:35:02,091 --> 00:35:06,370
It's like a username. It would take, you
all have three seconds to do that. That's,

634
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:07,850
yeah,
that would be smart.

635
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:11,750
It's interesting that because we're kind
of making the argument that you need

636
00:35:11,751 --> 00:35:15,170
some transparency online that you,

637
00:35:15,171 --> 00:35:18,800
you kind of have to be
traceable to a certain extent.

638
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:22,160
And that's what we're making the
argument. Yeah. Yes and no though.

639
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:24,810
I still maintained Steve
Wasniak, you know, the, the,

640
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:28,400
the great apple computer genius a set
and I think he was talking about file

641
00:35:28,401 --> 00:35:30,410
sharing. Um, you know,

642
00:35:30,411 --> 00:35:34,640
we're all like on this highway and the
highway has all of these lanes on it and

643
00:35:34,641 --> 00:35:36,470
we're all moving along and just
like kind of regular highway,

644
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:40,410
most of us during the day aren't like
shooting each other and driving each other

645
00:35:40,411 --> 00:35:42,900
off the road.
The highway tends to function day in,

646
00:35:42,901 --> 00:35:46,380
day out with millions of people on it.
Just fine. Even with the road rage,

647
00:35:46,381 --> 00:35:47,214
it's fine.

648
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:52,380
There may be one or two bad apples that
do something that's really crazy or

649
00:35:52,381 --> 00:35:55,660
dangerous. But you don't shut
the entire highway down. Right.

650
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,520
You figured out ways to police that and
we're in the same boat like just like

651
00:35:59,521 --> 00:36:00,060
with Napster.

652
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:03,600
People are trying to use old world
ways of policing this new terrain.

653
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,680
It isn't to say that we should have know
that it should be completely private in,

654
00:36:07,681 --> 00:36:10,230
there should be no transparency as to say,
hey guys,

655
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,750
those are massive human
revolution going on right now.

656
00:36:12,751 --> 00:36:15,540
Or an evolution or a cultural change,
whatever you want to call it.

657
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,750
This move from the industrial age
to the technological or digital age.

658
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:23,520
It's not going to be, it's going to be
a bumpy ride. There's no easy answer,

659
00:36:23,521 --> 00:36:28,020
but we need to come up with new laws
that affect how we convene in the space.

660
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:31,260
Not just say, nobody can get on this
highway. That's never, like you said,

661
00:36:31,261 --> 00:36:33,180
that's never going to happen.
It's never going to happen,

662
00:36:33,181 --> 00:36:36,570
and the g force that's
involved in this change,

663
00:36:36,571 --> 00:36:41,400
the change is so powerful and so rapid.
You're going to have some screw ups,

664
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:46,530
no way around it. It's going so fast
and we're going to stumble. We have to,

665
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,530
there's no way it's going to be smooth
and we're going to go backwards.

666
00:36:49,531 --> 00:36:50,970
We're going to make
mistakes. I mean, you know,

667
00:36:50,971 --> 00:36:53,790
I don't fault my kids when they were
like listening to music on Youtube.

668
00:36:53,791 --> 00:36:56,820
I mean we're kind of past the days of
my kids don't like use bittorrent for,

669
00:36:56,821 --> 00:37:00,330
for um, for um, you know, file sharing.

670
00:37:00,331 --> 00:37:03,870
But you don't think they do well.
Yeah, actually that's, yeah,

671
00:37:03,871 --> 00:37:06,480
it's completely nonsensical. My,
my older team does all the time.

672
00:37:06,481 --> 00:37:09,590
I keep talking to them about it, but
uh, yeah, he's a massive folder on us,

673
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:15,630
but it's mostly, yeah, I'm going, I'm not
going to shame shame him on the podcast,

674
00:37:15,631 --> 00:37:20,160
but uh, uh, but the reality of it is he,
he loves by music and he loves, you know,

675
00:37:20,161 --> 00:37:23,550
being part of the process
with bands like they've,

676
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:27,510
like there almost was a middle generation
that just went hog wild on just file

677
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:31,350
sharing all their music.
But most people like being part of the,

678
00:37:31,351 --> 00:37:33,030
that's why we have currency.

679
00:37:33,031 --> 00:37:35,790
That's why we have money and we
exchange cause it's like a human need.

680
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,750
So I think that a lot of this stuff will
iron itself out over time. I hate to,

681
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,910
but it will. I mean a lot
of people will be like, Oh,

682
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:44,560
here's how we monetize
the music. Oh, here's how,

683
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:48,330
how I can actually pay to help support
the bands I like and I'm still use the

684
00:37:48,331 --> 00:37:50,100
technology I like and we'll be okay.

685
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:52,080
I think time is actually
going to fix a lot of this,

686
00:37:52,081 --> 00:37:56,760
but we're definitely in a crazy
wild west right now. Yeah, I agree.

687
00:37:56,761 --> 00:37:57,594
I just think,

688
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:02,040
think that the disparity of income is
probably never going to be the same again

689
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:06,600
unless it comes from you don't spend
$20 on a CD with one good song on it

690
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:10,770
everywhere. What a drag.
That's true. Right.

691
00:38:10,771 --> 00:38:14,610
There was always the thing.
Do you remember going to
was at virgin that would,

692
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:16,170
they would have those listening booths.

693
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,310
There was the first time you would ever
get a chance to listen to the show to

694
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:19,860
shut that,

695
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:22,590
shut that sucker down and then probably
did more for killing the record.

696
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:26,610
Was it Brittany Spears? Whether
what? Wait, what? Oh Man. Yeah.

697
00:38:26,611 --> 00:38:29,910
Like you would listen to the hit and
then you listen to the Osa. Very,

698
00:38:29,911 --> 00:38:34,660
I'm not buying this fucking
thing. Yeah, yeah. That, that
was a big scam, right? Like,

699
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:39,790
look, I'm a huge rolling stones fan. Huge
Rolling Stones Fan. But let's be honest,

700
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:42,910
a good percentage of their
songs suck a fat deck.

701
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:45,970
If you go back and do some
girls. Yeah. Just some girls.

702
00:38:45,971 --> 00:38:48,600
Pretty much every track is gold,
but it's the sound girl.

703
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,420
There's some great fucking songs, but
there's also some songs that you just go,

704
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,510
oh yeah. Right. What
did you guys get high?

705
00:38:55,511 --> 00:38:59,440
And just slap this together when you're
on coke. Like does this, yeah, probably.

706
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:02,770
But they can't do that
anymore. Yeah. You can't now.

707
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:07,850
And then you're seeing like bands or
being forced into this position where you

708
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:12,640
are, you're represented by
your entire piece of work.

709
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:17,970
It's not just like a hit that you send
out that's sort of a bait to get you to

710
00:39:18,941 --> 00:39:23,340
buy the CD that's been sort of loosely
slapped together with shitty songs.

711
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:26,100
Totally. I mean, it's a cultural
thing. You can also look at the, uh,

712
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:31,030
the golden age of music being mega
profitable as a cultural moment.

713
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:35,620
You know, it was very brief, even in the
annals of, of the record industry itself,

714
00:39:35,621 --> 00:39:39,310
most for most of the history of
recorded music, it was about singles.

715
00:39:39,311 --> 00:39:43,690
It wasn't about albums, it was the
artists only made their money by touring.

716
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,170
You know, it was a very short period
of time historically actually,

717
00:39:47,171 --> 00:39:50,790
where you had this like 20
million sellers, 40 million.

718
00:39:50,791 --> 00:39:54,130
So these units being moved to these
enormous numbers that was never going to

719
00:39:54,131 --> 00:39:58,450
last. And it wasn't necessarily even
an organic thing anyway. And again,

720
00:39:58,451 --> 00:39:59,740
it's not to condone what happened,

721
00:39:59,741 --> 00:40:03,250
it's just to say that sometimes we lose
perspective and think it was always like

722
00:40:03,251 --> 00:40:07,230
this until those, those damn meddling
kids on their computers came along. Yeah.

723
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:07,991
That's interesting.

724
00:40:07,991 --> 00:40:12,250
You're not sure because like
file sharing really is like this,

725
00:40:12,251 --> 00:40:16,870
like blip, but record sales
are the real blip. Yeah.

726
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:21,460
I mean out of the thousands of years of
people creating music and musical art,

727
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:26,420
yeah. Look at this tiny brief window
where people were selling these things and

728
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:26,740
anything,

729
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:29,410
that amount of money we're talking
about probably no more than 25 years.

730
00:40:29,411 --> 00:40:32,590
I mean it's a really small window even
within the record industry's history.

731
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:35,170
That's fascinating when you
think about it that way.

732
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:37,660
Oh Donnie Einer and download it
talks about that quite a bit.

733
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:40,030
A really clear eye view of it
cause he really came up through,

734
00:40:40,031 --> 00:40:43,120
he was like the youngest president
of Columbia. Really Amazing Guy.

735
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:47,650
Just had a very interesting perspective
on, on the bubble as it were. The side,

736
00:40:47,651 --> 00:40:49,690
the other side of it.
What is the,

737
00:40:49,691 --> 00:40:53,400
what's the view of the music or
the movie business? Have the,

738
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:57,910
has the movie business taken a big hit
from file sharing? Um, I mean it, it,

739
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:01,930
I think the game of Thrones thing is, is
really been the question. Um, you know,

740
00:41:01,931 --> 00:41:05,290
there was a lot of uproar about the
amount of piracy that was going on in the

741
00:41:05,291 --> 00:41:07,480
amount of file sharing that was
going on around the game of Thrones.

742
00:41:07,481 --> 00:41:12,310
And then at a certain point HPO sort of
changed, shifted position from saying,

743
00:41:12,311 --> 00:41:14,470
this is really terrible and you're
all criminals to wait a minute.

744
00:41:14,471 --> 00:41:16,270
You guys all really love what we have.

745
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:18,970
This is becoming the
most popular show on TV.

746
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,370
Let's figure out how to get it to you.
You know?

747
00:41:21,371 --> 00:41:24,520
And they started coming up with
alternatives like HBO go. To me,

748
00:41:24,521 --> 00:41:27,370
that's really the right way to
look at it. And I know it's, again,

749
00:41:27,371 --> 00:41:30,970
I'm not being Glib. It's not fun
to lose lots of money when you're,

750
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:34,130
when you're putting so much money
and time into doing these works.

751
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:36,920
But it's being realistic that
people all over the world,

752
00:41:36,921 --> 00:41:40,010
they want their content at the same time.
They wanted a certain way.

753
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,010
It isn't gonna Change. So I think
people have to change with the times.

754
00:41:43,011 --> 00:41:44,180
And some are,
and some aren't.

755
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:48,900
Hbo Ceo doesn't care that you
are sharing your HBO go pass.

756
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,490
And that took a, that took some time.
I mean, he had the opposite viewpoint.

757
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:56,480
Look at that, that quote, we're in the
business of creating addicts. Yeah. Wow.

758
00:41:56,510 --> 00:42:00,920
Good for you. You smart
bastard. Yeah. Richard Plepler.

759
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:06,290
Richard Go, go Richard.
You Go, boy. Yeah. Yeah,

760
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:09,440
that's a, don't say it. Try saying
his name 10 times in a row. Quickly.

761
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,850
Smart fellow.
Yeah,

762
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:15,440
and that's smart because like there's 350
goddamn million people in this country.

763
00:42:15,441 --> 00:42:18,890
If you can get 350 million people
to watch your show, that's amazing.

764
00:42:18,891 --> 00:42:21,230
And then just global, like game
of Thrones is all over the world,

765
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,880
so you're going to get a lot.

766
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:27,750
But that's a show that
requires an exorbitant amount
of money to create. Yeah,

767
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:32,060
the special effects are crazy and
huge and the production is enormous.

768
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:33,120
The reality of it is,

769
00:42:33,121 --> 00:42:36,500
is it's always been on the
onus of business to figure
out how to make a profit.

770
00:42:36,501 --> 00:42:39,410
And that's what drives them crazy because
right now they're in a period where

771
00:42:39,411 --> 00:42:42,890
the consumers have taken back the power
and they're scratching their heads going,

772
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:44,780
oh shit.
Now what do we do?

773
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:48,050
We've got to figure out how to create a
system where we can get maximum profit.

774
00:42:48,051 --> 00:42:49,940
Again, they've, they've
taken a knock back,

775
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:54,470
but on what I don't respond too well
is when they retaliate against their

776
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:57,920
consumers and go,
it's your fault that we got knocked back.

777
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,800
You guys are criminals
and we're going to eat.

778
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:03,560
This is bad and we have to educate you
that you need to give us profit again. No,

779
00:43:03,561 --> 00:43:06,370
I mean we have to educate
you that this is wrong.

780
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,160
I mean their motive is purely profit
based, so I get that it's a drag,

781
00:43:10,161 --> 00:43:13,730
but it's up to you to figure out a way to
make a profit out of what you're doing.

782
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,760
They also don't have a stranglehold on
the promotional aspect to anymore because

783
00:43:19,641 --> 00:43:20,340
of the Internet,

784
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:24,080
because of Youtube and Twitter and
Facebook and people sharing links.

785
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:27,980
A band king become really
popular really quickly.

786
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:32,690
Like someone could pass something along
and then it becomes a viral hit on

787
00:43:32,691 --> 00:43:36,980
youtube and you go, wow. It's things
like that. Fucking Gangnam style. Right.

788
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:40,930
That's a perfect example. The greatest
song ever written that song? Not yet.

789
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,870
That did not get popular because it was
on the radio or because it was good.

790
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,020
Some people in dry though.

791
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:53,150
That's how you have many minds of people
in my fucking six year old and my four

792
00:43:53,151 --> 00:43:57,380
year old go crazy on the teletubbies is
has some kind of weird primordial sort

793
00:43:57,381 --> 00:44:01,760
of trigger switch. You
know, it's a silly video.

794
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:04,550
It's silly and it's videos.
What works if you were a little kid,

795
00:44:04,551 --> 00:44:07,190
would love to show it. Yeah,
for sure. But the perfect,

796
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:10,520
it's a perfect example in that like
did that didn't require any promotional

797
00:44:10,521 --> 00:44:14,600
vehicle other than people enjoying it
and sharing it with other people and then

798
00:44:14,601 --> 00:44:18,260
it spread like wildfire. Totally.
And it used to be, look at that.

799
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:22,690
Oh my God, look at that number.
Yeah, that's 8 million. Yeah, no,

800
00:44:22,691 --> 00:44:27,080
that's 2 billion. Oh, here we go along
number. I was looking at subscribers.

801
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:29,690
His subscribers are almost 8 million,

802
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:34,530
but his number of use is 2 billion.
That's a billion.

803
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:39,470
Yeah. What the fuck? That's
crazy. See, and that's all. Yeah,

804
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:43,620
just viral. That's community. That's
community that used to require,

805
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:46,910
you used to have to have a radio station.
Yeah.

806
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:50,520
He used to have and used to have to be
in bed with that radio station record

807
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:54,180
company would put a gun to your head
physically and make you play a single to

808
00:44:54,181 --> 00:44:58,140
give it that kind of juice and
yeah and they had these deals,

809
00:44:58,141 --> 00:45:03,060
these under the table deals with record
companies where they would not pay play

810
00:45:03,061 --> 00:45:06,960
certain people because they were black
ball and that was a real issue in your

811
00:45:06,961 --> 00:45:11,220
hands. Yeah. Payola yeah and just
the, they, they were in control.

812
00:45:11,221 --> 00:45:15,720
They had the power and the
record companies being these
huge organizations with

813
00:45:15,721 --> 00:45:17,700
a massive amount of money behind them.

814
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:22,940
They were able to sort of create stars
and there was a lot of artificial stars

815
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:25,620
that they created this by mouth.

816
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:29,670
Fucking everybody with this music
just forcing it into your ears.

817
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:32,180
They can't do that anymore.
No that's the,

818
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:35,070
that that ship has definitely sailed and
they're going to have to come up with

819
00:45:35,071 --> 00:45:38,070
alternative ways to, to get back
to some degree of where they were.

820
00:45:38,071 --> 00:45:40,110
And it may take time that I
actually believe they'll get there.

821
00:45:40,111 --> 00:45:43,140
Cause people are very, very clever at
figuring out how to make money. Well,

822
00:45:43,141 --> 00:45:46,380
I think they will try,
but I do not believe they will.

823
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,660
I think that music will always be big.
Yeah.

824
00:45:48,661 --> 00:45:51,480
But I think the era of record
companies having to kind of influence,

825
00:45:51,481 --> 00:45:53,670
they used to having the
face of it be the same.

826
00:45:53,671 --> 00:45:56,370
I agree it's going to be something else.
We just don't know what that is yet.

827
00:45:56,690 --> 00:45:59,910
Yeah,
because music the way it is now,

828
00:45:59,911 --> 00:46:04,230
one of the weird things about music now
is there's no longer deejays anymore.

829
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:07,830
You know what I mean? When I was
a kid there was like, you know,

830
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,620
there was all these radio d,
do you remember that show?

831
00:46:10,621 --> 00:46:15,120
Wk Irp and Cincinnati and a lot of
that show was about these personality.

832
00:46:15,121 --> 00:46:18,510
I grew up with those people.
All the popular djs. Yeah.

833
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:23,010
Like when I was a kid who was Charles
Laquidara and Boston, the big mattress.

834
00:46:23,011 --> 00:46:26,370
Dave Sherman in New York. Yeah.
There's all these morning DJ guys.

835
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,300
Of course the big one was always Howard
stern morning, but he was, you know,

836
00:46:30,301 --> 00:46:33,810
he went from music originally and
then just went to straight talk.

837
00:46:33,811 --> 00:46:37,080
Probably the first guy ever to
do that on FM the way he did it.

838
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:42,000
But those guys don't even exist anymore.
They don't those morning Dj guys,

839
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:46,620
they have a tiny window where
they're allowed to talk and you know,

840
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:49,170
there's not that many of them
anymore and they're dying.

841
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:54,010
They're just disappearing and they're
being replaced by these weird programs.

842
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:57,840
Stations. Yeah, no, it's true. The
radio is really changing dramatically.

843
00:46:57,841 --> 00:47:00,570
I mean I think, you know, kind of what
you're driving at is like curation,

844
00:47:00,571 --> 00:47:03,510
this whole idea that that that people
would cure rate and you could go to a

845
00:47:03,511 --> 00:47:06,180
place in here, something that
is evolving much more quickly.

846
00:47:06,181 --> 00:47:10,170
Like I think that's been the next phase
of digital music is now we're finding

847
00:47:10,171 --> 00:47:13,860
more curation on online, whether it's
through Spotify or other services.

848
00:47:13,861 --> 00:47:17,670
Pitchfork, you know, where you can go,
oh, I want to get certain kinds of music.

849
00:47:17,671 --> 00:47:18,570
I'm going to go here.

850
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:22,590
And what's cool about the internet is
that you can pull like the best rock

851
00:47:22,591 --> 00:47:25,890
critics together or the best whatever
kind of music you like and you can

852
00:47:25,891 --> 00:47:30,010
aggregate that are sort of compile it
through Spotify or some service and just

853
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:34,660
check out what they want. You know, you
can choose who your DJ is in a way. Right.

854
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:36,910
And that's what a Dj used to be like.

855
00:47:36,911 --> 00:47:39,790
A Dj was kind of an
artist in a way for sure.

856
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:43,300
Because a DJ would turn you on to some
stuff that you'd never heard before. Yeah.

857
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:46,840
They would, they would have the ability
to play with, they wanted to play. Yeah.

858
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:49,880
Yeah. The notion of
gatekeepers has changed a lot.

859
00:47:49,881 --> 00:47:53,410
And on most of the gatekeepers that
existed are no longer gatekeepers. Well,

860
00:47:53,411 --> 00:47:56,650
the word sort of concentrating
on one aspect of this issue,

861
00:47:56,651 --> 00:48:01,370
which is sort of a file sharing
and the digital reality of,

862
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:05,350
of songs and things along those lines.
But this,

863
00:48:05,351 --> 00:48:10,351
the Silk Road story was a lot
more about drugs and infiltration.

864
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:14,200
Yeah. And there was a lot going
on. Yeah. Yeah. There was a,

865
00:48:14,201 --> 00:48:16,010
it was actually a political movement.
I mean the,

866
00:48:16,011 --> 00:48:20,020
the Silk Road was whether you agree with
it or not and the movie is not about

867
00:48:20,021 --> 00:48:23,200
taking a side as much as trying to show
what it actually was as opposed to what

868
00:48:23,201 --> 00:48:26,380
we heard about in the media.
Um, it was a political movement.

869
00:48:26,381 --> 00:48:28,210
I mean it was a community that was,

870
00:48:28,211 --> 00:48:33,100
that was put together with certain
political ideals and they weren't all the

871
00:48:33,101 --> 00:48:35,470
same. That's the, the, some
of them were libertarian,

872
00:48:35,471 --> 00:48:38,890
some of them were hardcore leftwing
people, more socialist oriented,

873
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,090
some of them were in the middle.

874
00:48:40,091 --> 00:48:45,091
But what unify them was this desire to
have individual freedom and privacy and

875
00:48:45,641 --> 00:48:46,271
anonymity.

876
00:48:46,271 --> 00:48:49,780
And there was a lot of people in that
community and a lot of people were there

877
00:48:49,781 --> 00:48:51,610
for the community.
And that's a very,

878
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:55,390
I think a very threatening thing as well
as being an interesting moment in time.

879
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:57,490
And a lot of people were
there for the community,

880
00:48:57,491 --> 00:49:01,000
but there was some weird shit
that went down at first of all,

881
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:04,150
some people at infiltrated this
community, right? Like law enforcement.

882
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,670
I mean of course law enforcement
was there from day one.

883
00:49:06,671 --> 00:49:08,590
I mean they want the law enforcement.
I mean,

884
00:49:08,591 --> 00:49:11,860
of course if you see that there's a
market online that's selling heroin,

885
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:12,401
you know,

886
00:49:12,401 --> 00:49:16,870
via the postal service and you're in any
number of three letter law enforcement

887
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:20,110
agencies, you're going to be showing up
at that. How'd they find out about it?

888
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:22,720
Well, I mean in order to sell
drugs you have to advertise.

889
00:49:22,721 --> 00:49:25,330
So it sort of went out on the
wire enough to enough people.

890
00:49:25,331 --> 00:49:29,080
So if like if I'm afraid in Ohio and
I know to buy my drugs on online,

891
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:32,560
some cop somewhere is going to know.
And once one cop knows,

892
00:49:32,561 --> 00:49:35,050
they all know and it
was on, you know, to do,

893
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:39,160
to credit the FBI and the DEA, they
knew what was going on, you know,

894
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:40,150
pretty early on.

895
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:44,440
And they installed undercover operatives
with fictitious user accounts.

896
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,710
It just turned out some of
them were dirty. Um, you know,

897
00:49:47,711 --> 00:49:51,910
that's what came out a couple of weeks
ago was that two of the lead agents on

898
00:49:51,911 --> 00:49:53,350
the Silk Road case out of Baltimore,

899
00:49:53,351 --> 00:49:57,940
Dea agents and secret service where were
extorting tons of money off the Silk

900
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:00,400
Road and putting it into
personal accounts and you know,

901
00:50:00,401 --> 00:50:03,850
creating murder for hire
entrapment schemes. I mean it was,

902
00:50:03,851 --> 00:50:08,440
they were kind of off the rails. But of
course when you're dealing with, you know,

903
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:10,900
alternative communities
that are that radical,

904
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:12,820
of course they are going to
be bad things that happen.

905
00:50:12,821 --> 00:50:16,240
And of course there's going to
be things that are, you know, uh,

906
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:19,230
not on the up and up.
And this cop thing happened after that.

907
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:23,710
You got done finishing? Well, it
was revealed. I actually knew some,

908
00:50:23,711 --> 00:50:24,820
something about it,
but I was,

909
00:50:24,821 --> 00:50:27,350
it was like I was kind of gag
ordered and that it wasn't,

910
00:50:27,351 --> 00:50:30,290
it was a grand jury indictment,
um, investigation going on.

911
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:32,420
So we weren't allowed to
talk about it. The, uh,

912
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:35,420
Russell Burk's defense attorney wasn't
allowed to bring it up in the trial.

913
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,450
I knew that something was going
on involving rogue agents.

914
00:50:38,451 --> 00:50:39,770
I didn't know exactly what it was,

915
00:50:39,771 --> 00:50:43,970
but I kind of put two and two together
that that's what it was. But um, you know,

916
00:50:43,971 --> 00:50:46,310
it came out, uh, after
the trial. I mean I have,

917
00:50:46,311 --> 00:50:49,760
I've now gone back and addressed it
slightly in the movie, but you know,

918
00:50:49,761 --> 00:50:53,270
it only has so much relevance because
the film again isn't, you know,

919
00:50:53,271 --> 00:50:56,660
saying that the guys who built the Silk
Road or heroes and that these guys are

920
00:50:56,661 --> 00:50:57,261
just bad.

921
00:50:57,261 --> 00:51:00,890
The point is that you have all kinds
of people mixed up and things like this

922
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:01,760
good and bad.

923
00:51:01,761 --> 00:51:04,820
There are plenty of good law enforcement
agents just like there were a rogue

924
00:51:04,821 --> 00:51:05,121
ones.

925
00:51:05,121 --> 00:51:08,090
There are plenty of good people on the
Silk Road just like there were bad ones

926
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:11,700
and there was probably the, the ones
who went bad, they were probably like,

927
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:14,990
there's nobody that can figure
out what I'm doing here.

928
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:18,140
This is all craziness
under this web thing.

929
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:20,570
I think that you can get
a false sense of security,

930
00:51:20,571 --> 00:51:23,120
that if you're using an anonymous browser,

931
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:24,740
if you're using a fictitious user name,

932
00:51:24,741 --> 00:51:28,160
if you're using a cryptocurrency like
bitcoin that doesn't have your name

933
00:51:28,161 --> 00:51:28,851
attached to it,

934
00:51:28,851 --> 00:51:32,300
you can have this false sense of
security that you're untouchable,

935
00:51:32,301 --> 00:51:34,670
which you know, as I
said earlier, you know,

936
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,690
everything that happens in the digital
world tends to be very traceable.

937
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:42,980
On some level it's,
it's hard to be truly anonymous online.

938
00:51:42,981 --> 00:51:44,600
You have to go through,
you can do it,

939
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:48,810
but you have to go through an enormous
lengths to remain truly anonymous on the,

940
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:52,220
you know, one little slip
and you're done. And you can,

941
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:56,330
the thing about the Internet is one
friend of mine within the Silk Road, um,

942
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:57,111
said to me,
he's like,

943
00:51:57,111 --> 00:52:00,950
the Internet never forgets so you
could make a slip five years ago.

944
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,610
But if I'm a federal agent and I'm like
winding met way through your fictitious

945
00:52:04,611 --> 00:52:08,080
user history and I get
to that one slip your,

946
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,940
if that door has been opened once
and the light shone on your face,

947
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:14,630
that's all they need is once. And whether
that's law enforcement or a hacker,

948
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:17,570
anybody, if there's a vulnerability
they're going to get in.

949
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:20,960
So these guys who were
the bad undercover agents,

950
00:52:20,961 --> 00:52:23,960
they had diverted hundreds of
thousands of dollars in Bitcoin,

951
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:28,040
really over a million, over $1
million and they got caught. Yeah.

952
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:29,870
How'd they get caught?
They um,

953
00:52:29,871 --> 00:52:32,580
well it's not totally known
because to be fair it was an under,

954
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:36,200
it was a sting operation from
within the DEA and other agencies.

955
00:52:36,201 --> 00:52:38,750
So they're not completely telling
everyone how they got caught,

956
00:52:38,751 --> 00:52:43,220
but they were known as Mike's got a new
boat. There was, there was some of that.

957
00:52:43,221 --> 00:52:46,610
There was like people paying off their
mortgages when they're only making 150

958
00:52:46,611 --> 00:52:50,060
before taxes. There were, there were
some dumb mistakes that got made.

959
00:52:50,061 --> 00:52:52,580
There were accounts set up
with a lot of money in them.

960
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:57,680
There were too many user fictitious user
names, you know that eventually again,

961
00:52:57,681 --> 00:53:02,090
one tiny slip of one email account that
you use to connect yourself to one. It's,

962
00:53:02,091 --> 00:53:04,970
it's, that's the thing about the digital
world as you can. It's like a flow chart.

963
00:53:04,971 --> 00:53:06,530
You can just sit and look at it and go,
oh,

964
00:53:06,531 --> 00:53:08,690
it went from here to here
to here and then that's it.

965
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:13,110
So those guys got busted.
Um,

966
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:18,050
were they involved in any of
the cases that were Oh yeah.

967
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:23,330
And is that being looked at now as like
potential corruption that maybe the

968
00:53:23,331 --> 00:53:27,930
cases are tainted? Indictments might
be thrown out totally. Oh, that's big.

969
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,230
Yeah.
Now the,

970
00:53:30,231 --> 00:53:33,950
there was also some murder for hire
stuff if you were talking about, yeah,

971
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,860
it was it real murder for hire or what?
We don't know. See, here's the thing is,

972
00:53:37,861 --> 00:53:42,600
is that one of the agents that was
arrested was the, was the undercover,

973
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:46,350
um, who was sort of at the heart of
that first murder for hire. Stang.

974
00:53:46,351 --> 00:53:49,290
So he basically actually framed
somebody else in the Silk Road,

975
00:53:49,291 --> 00:53:52,360
said that person stole money when
actually he was the one who is,

976
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:54,900
who took the money and said we should do,
you know,

977
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:59,400
instigated doing something to that person
who was just one of the vendors on the

978
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:02,280
Silk Road. And that turns out to not only
be a cop, which we've known all along,

979
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:04,350
but a dirty cop,
a cop who was,

980
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:08,490
who was stealing money and blackmailing
people within the Silk Road. So the,

981
00:54:08,491 --> 00:54:11,220
the murder for hire, there were no
bodies that were, there were no,

982
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,860
there had been no murders,
there were no bodies that were ever found.

983
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:17,490
A No one appears to have
been hurt, um, on any level.

984
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:22,260
And what we still don't totally know is
what their antibody and who that was, um,

985
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:26,040
actually originally instigated
those murders for hire, the,

986
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:28,400
just to bring you up to speed quickly.
The,

987
00:54:28,401 --> 00:54:32,130
the prosecution claimed they had a lot
of hard evidence against Ross all break.

988
00:54:32,131 --> 00:54:33,300
They said they have his laptop,

989
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:37,590
they said on that laptop they found a
journal that he wrote that in which a key

990
00:54:37,591 --> 00:54:40,980
clearly laid out what he did on
the Silk Road the whole time.

991
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:43,860
They believe it attributes him
to the dread pirate Roberts,

992
00:54:43,861 --> 00:54:47,190
who they showed a dread
pirate Roberts records saying,

993
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:49,200
I want to take a hit out on this person.

994
00:54:49,201 --> 00:54:53,490
I'm going to send you the x amount
of bitcoin. Um, so they're saying,

995
00:54:53,610 --> 00:54:57,300
here's Ross's journal. It's on his laptop.
It's talking about murders for hire.

996
00:54:57,690 --> 00:54:59,700
But the other thing you have
to keep in mind is two things.

997
00:54:59,701 --> 00:55:03,330
One is he wasn't charged with murder.
That was not an indictment.

998
00:55:03,331 --> 00:55:06,690
That was even part of his case.
They didn't charge him for murder.

999
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:07,920
They just talked about it.

1000
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:10,140
They didn't have to prove it because
he wasn't being charged with it.

1001
00:55:10,141 --> 00:55:14,610
He's only being trudged primarily the
drug kingpin conspiracy and hacking

1002
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:19,140
charges, which carry a
potentially life in prison. Now,

1003
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:20,940
the drug conspiracy charges,

1004
00:55:20,941 --> 00:55:25,050
was it directly related to him
distributing drugs? No, it was,

1005
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:27,810
it was him being at the
center of the website.

1006
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:31,410
So that gets into transfer of intent,
internet issues as well. But no, he was,

1007
00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:35,430
he was being charged with creating
a service that allowed the,

1008
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:37,410
the selling of,
of you know,

1009
00:55:37,411 --> 00:55:41,400
millions of dollars worth of drugs to
millions of people. That seems so shifty.

1010
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,280
It's like as far as charging someone
for that, because in that case,

1011
00:55:44,281 --> 00:55:48,360
can't you charge Twitter? Can't you
charge Facebook? I, I mean, I don't know.

1012
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:51,960
I don't have any personal information of
people selling drugs through Facebook,

1013
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:56,490
but I gotta imagine someone has sent a
Facebook message to someone saying, Hey,

1014
00:55:56,491 --> 00:55:59,760
you want to buy some coke? Well,
yeah, I think the argument is this,

1015
00:55:59,761 --> 00:56:04,560
this site was specifically created
for selling illegal drugs. The,

1016
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:09,510
the, the, uh, defendant, well,
that's the claim, right? You know,

1017
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:14,280
um, the defense's argument is
twofold. They say a, um, you know,

1018
00:56:14,281 --> 00:56:17,520
this person, uh, the dread pirate
Roberts wasn't even selling drugs.

1019
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:21,690
They were just, you know, the creator
of this politically oriented freedom,

1020
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:24,940
you know, dark website and people will
be, do whatever they wanted to on it.

1021
00:56:24,941 --> 00:56:26,460
And he was anti-drug Warren.

1022
00:56:26,810 --> 00:56:30,190
You mean you can't deny that there was
a big drug component to the Silk Road by

1023
00:56:30,191 --> 00:56:32,170
its very nature, it was
a big, this sort of,

1024
00:56:32,171 --> 00:56:36,400
the motivation of the Silk Road via the
dread pirate Roberts writing was about

1025
00:56:36,401 --> 00:56:39,070
removing harm and crying from the drug,
drug trade and,

1026
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:41,920
and helping to bring
the drug war to an end.

1027
00:56:42,310 --> 00:56:45,670
But they also claimed that the journal
and all that stuff in the bit coin found

1028
00:56:45,671 --> 00:56:48,280
on Ross is a computer,
aren't his.

1029
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:53,580
They claim that he was hacked and that
the whole silk road was filled with all

1030
00:56:53,711 --> 00:56:58,240
kinds of people like these murky DEA
agents that we're using other people's

1031
00:56:58,241 --> 00:57:03,240
usernames and accounts, which they
were, that the Internet world is so, um,

1032
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:04,563
uh,

1033
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:08,950
hard to pin down once you get behind
fictitious usernames that they're saying

1034
00:57:08,951 --> 00:57:10,600
that none of this stuff was actually his,

1035
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:13,180
and that's what they're
taking into an appeal.

1036
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:15,790
Like they feel so strongly about that
they're moving forward with appeal.

1037
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:19,840
Prosecution said that's nonsense. This
stuff was all on his, on his laptop.

1038
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:21,640
And in the current trial that just ended,

1039
00:57:21,641 --> 00:57:25,900
the jury sided with the prosecution
and Ross was found guilty on all seven

1040
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:27,520
counts.
He's being sentenced in a few weeks,

1041
00:57:27,521 --> 00:57:31,840
but they are moving to an appeal and
maybe we'll find out more and maybe that

1042
00:57:31,841 --> 00:57:34,720
will turn out to be the truth.
We, we don't know what it was.

1043
00:57:34,721 --> 00:57:38,470
He found guilty before it was revealed
that there was these dirty yes.

1044
00:57:39,930 --> 00:57:40,960
Yeah, they, and they did.

1045
00:57:40,961 --> 00:57:44,110
And they knew that this case existed
and they didn't allow like the, the,

1046
00:57:44,111 --> 00:57:45,350
the lawyer Ross,

1047
00:57:45,351 --> 00:57:48,360
his defense was trying to postpone the
trial a couple of months so that the

1048
00:57:48,370 --> 00:57:49,990
grand jury investigation,

1049
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:53,620
the criminal charges that you knew
were going to drop the complaint. Um,

1050
00:57:53,621 --> 00:57:56,920
but they were not allowed to postpone the
trial and that seems like a slam dunk.

1051
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:00,430
If you can prove that these cops are
using other people's usernames and they

1052
00:58:00,431 --> 00:58:04,540
were hacking into people's accounts
and that, that seems like right there.

1053
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:08,070
Like you, you can't prove anybody
that's a trial. I would certainly,

1054
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,710
I'd like to see that trial.
Like my perspective on it is,

1055
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:13,750
is I'm fine with whatever
the truth turns out to be.

1056
00:58:13,751 --> 00:58:18,160
I would just love to see both sides have
their day and I was at that trial and

1057
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:21,580
the defense did not have a day.
That's always how it is though, man.

1058
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:25,420
Mean the idea that you get a fair trial
is such a fucking joke because there's

1059
00:58:25,421 --> 00:58:27,370
so much railroading going on.
Yeah.

1060
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:31,410
Especially when there's an agenda like
this to prosecute someone in a, in a,

1061
00:58:31,670 --> 00:58:35,800
an important case, a landmark case. They
think is going to establish a precedent.

1062
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:40,740
They will fuck you. Yeah.
That's kind of how it is. Yeah.

1063
00:58:40,830 --> 00:58:43,240
And they will fuck you.
And that's what they did to this guy.

1064
00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:47,560
Now this dread pirate Roberts character.
What's his name? Dread Pirate Roberts. Oh,

1065
00:58:47,570 --> 00:58:51,990
I mean the guy that was accused of being
diff because they think Russell Brook

1066
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:55,510
and he's denying that he was dread
pirate Roberts. Yeah. He's saying,

1067
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:56,770
here's what we know about him.

1068
00:58:56,860 --> 00:59:00,490
We know that he had these like hardcore
libertarian values. He wasn't a hacker.

1069
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:04,580
He was not a computer guy. Didn't
know anything about coding at all. Um,

1070
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:06,910
he was a physics major,
you know, he was a,

1071
00:59:06,990 --> 00:59:10,240
he'd put himself through two
universities on full scholarship.

1072
00:59:10,241 --> 00:59:14,500
You had a master's degree in mechanical
engineering from Penn State. Very Bright.

1073
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,880
Um, we know that he had hardcore
libertarian politics. We know that much.

1074
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:21,010
He admitted to creating the Silk Road,

1075
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:24,560
said he did it to create it like an
economic simulation where he would combine

1076
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:27,890
tour and Bitcoin to allow
a marketplace to exist.

1077
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:30,890
It would be free for everybody to use.
However they wanted to use it.

1078
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:35,060
He claims he say he built it with the
help of a lot of other people was he

1079
00:59:35,061 --> 00:59:37,580
doesn't really know how to
code and he just let it run.

1080
00:59:37,581 --> 00:59:41,060
And he took off and he was done and he
moved on. And that's what his family,

1081
00:59:41,061 --> 00:59:43,160
his mom and dad back him on that.
And that's what the,

1082
00:59:43,161 --> 00:59:47,180
his family claims they given being around
him because they're very tight knit

1083
00:59:47,181 --> 00:59:49,550
family. All this time they
were like, this was not,

1084
00:59:49,551 --> 00:59:51,050
someone was on his laptop all the time.

1085
00:59:51,051 --> 00:59:52,800
I don't know how he could
have been running a, you know,

1086
00:59:53,450 --> 00:59:58,280
a almost a billion dollar drug
empire. He wasn't, you know, that guy.

1087
00:59:58,281 --> 01:00:01,760
He wasn't, the guy just sat on his
monitors keyboard all the time. Um,

1088
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:05,450
so he claimed he's not dread
pirate Roberts prosecution
claims that he was and,

1089
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:08,450
and uh, and that was what
that first trial was about.

1090
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,730
What is their proof that he was of,

1091
01:00:10,731 --> 01:00:14,000
they did find a journal on his laptop
and the journal on his laptop is like,

1092
01:00:14,001 --> 01:00:16,490
you know, today I'm setting up a
dread pirate Roberts account today.

1093
01:00:16,491 --> 01:00:17,510
I'm going to do this today.

1094
01:00:17,511 --> 01:00:22,160
Fuck does that fuck writes a journal
on their laptop of all the shit they're

1095
01:00:22,161 --> 01:00:25,460
going to do today, I will take over the
world. Just kind of how it was that,

1096
01:00:25,470 --> 01:00:30,290
that seems so silly. Yeah. I mean
it's, it's, you know, it again,

1097
01:00:30,291 --> 01:00:32,810
I would love to see, like I went
to the trial thinking, okay,

1098
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:34,370
now we're going to see what happened.
Right.

1099
01:00:34,371 --> 01:00:38,180
And I would love to see the defense
really have time to sort of talk through

1100
01:00:38,181 --> 01:00:40,970
their end and have expert witnesses
and get into the nitty gritty of it.

1101
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:44,300
Because I mean, I would side with where
the, wherever the truth lies, but,

1102
01:00:44,301 --> 01:00:47,210
but to be in the courtroom and to
hear all that and just think, okay,

1103
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:50,630
if this is true, this is like
the most naive, you know,

1104
01:00:50,631 --> 01:00:53,510
criminal mastermind in the history of,

1105
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:56,540
could you imagine to be breaking
bad would've lasted like,

1106
01:00:56,541 --> 01:00:59,990
wouldn't have lasted half a season if
they had Walter White, like, you know,

1107
01:00:59,991 --> 01:01:03,960
so today I'll plant a bomb and the
courthouse today I'm going to blow up that

1108
01:01:03,961 --> 01:01:07,130
bomb. Yeah. And if you're reading this,
don't tell anyone from law enforcement,

1109
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:07,941
you know.
Yeah.

1110
01:01:07,941 --> 01:01:12,080
It's not like he knows a lot
about computers and those
computer could be hacked

1111
01:01:12,081 --> 01:01:14,600
into or anything. Yeah. That's so stupid.

1112
01:01:15,230 --> 01:01:17,210
They didn't plant that on his laptop.

1113
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:20,480
When you're dealing with all this other
shit that these cops planted information

1114
01:01:20,481 --> 01:01:25,250
and the fake hit man for hire shit.
Yeah, it's, it's really murky. I mean,

1115
01:01:25,251 --> 01:01:28,520
to be honest with you, the film goes
to certain degree into that stuff. I'm,

1116
01:01:28,521 --> 01:01:31,150
I'm very interested in looking at
all the issues at the movies raised,

1117
01:01:31,151 --> 01:01:34,820
but I have to be careful of how far
I go into that material. You know,

1118
01:01:34,850 --> 01:01:37,970
there's almost a whole other movie
and there really is, right? Yeah.

1119
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:38,780
There's a whole under,
well,

1120
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:43,580
I think there's a movie in
and guys getting rare or
people getting railroaded in

1121
01:01:43,581 --> 01:01:46,430
trials too. You know,
what makes it look like?

1122
01:01:46,431 --> 01:01:51,431
I have a friend who went
to jail for growing medical
marijuana that was legal in

1123
01:01:52,521 --> 01:01:56,960
California and when he went to jail
because the federal government tried them,

1124
01:01:56,961 --> 01:02:00,110
the federal government doesn't
even recognize medical marijuana,

1125
01:02:00,111 --> 01:02:04,870
so they refuse to even allow him say
the term medical marijuana. Right.

1126
01:02:04,970 --> 01:02:09,970
They also refuse to allow into court
the fact that it was passed into law in

1127
01:02:10,911 --> 01:02:14,780
California. You could not bring that
up at all because it was irrelevant.

1128
01:02:14,781 --> 01:02:18,050
This is a state issue.
We're talking about a federal issue.

1129
01:02:18,051 --> 01:02:22,080
It's totally irrelevant. Yeah. So this
guy went to jail for drug trafficking,

1130
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:26,970
right when he was a legal medical provider
by the law of the state of California.

1131
01:02:26,971 --> 01:02:27,750
Yeah.
Yeah.

1132
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:30,420
And that's like those are the people
that are going to get caught up in the

1133
01:02:30,421 --> 01:02:33,030
wheels of, of this transition, you know,

1134
01:02:33,031 --> 01:02:36,750
because in 10 years that's going to be
unheard of. Yeah. It's, it's so tragic.

1135
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,340
And then it's creepy.

1136
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,940
It's creepy that they can do that and
they can keep you from to communicating

1137
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:46,170
all the facts of the case.
It's you. You're not granted
the right to a fair trial.

1138
01:02:46,171 --> 01:02:47,910
You re granted the right to a fair,

1139
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,270
fair trial by the standard
of the people who are trying.

1140
01:02:51,271 --> 01:02:56,100
You want very desperately to convict you.
Correct. Yeah, yeah. That's fair enough.

1141
01:02:56,101 --> 01:02:57,750
Fuckface yeah, exactly. Yeah.

1142
01:02:57,980 --> 01:03:00,810
As I give this very little narrow path
that you're allowed to go down and you

1143
01:03:00,811 --> 01:03:03,930
can't stray on either side of that path
and that path basically leads to your

1144
01:03:03,931 --> 01:03:04,764
jail cell.

1145
01:03:04,770 --> 01:03:08,970
So they can't prove that this
guy actually sold any drugs.

1146
01:03:09,150 --> 01:03:13,080
But because he created this forum
that allowed other people to do it,

1147
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,650
like they're not saying that he was
involved in any of these tracks,

1148
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:19,860
transactions? No. And there they
can send it to him for fucking,

1149
01:03:19,890 --> 01:03:22,590
he's up for life I
think as minimum is the,

1150
01:03:22,591 --> 01:03:26,280
is 30 20 to 30 years minimum without
parole. And how long has he been in jail?

1151
01:03:26,310 --> 01:03:29,370
Waiting? A year and a half.
Oh, solitary confinement.

1152
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:34,920
Oh my God. Yeah. And is any,

1153
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:38,330
is there any hope? Um, you
know, I hope that they get an,

1154
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:42,060
I really just hope to see the other
side talk. You know what I mean?

1155
01:03:42,061 --> 01:03:44,850
That's the part that was very chilling
and frustrating when I was in the

1156
01:03:44,851 --> 01:03:47,400
courtroom was just like,
it just ended like it was just Bam.

1157
01:03:47,401 --> 01:03:50,850
Prosecution said their piece defense was
about two. They got blocked. It was over.

1158
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:54,450
They got blocked. Yeah. You can watch
the film, but basically they were,

1159
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:57,690
they were just like you just talked about
with your friend. They were unable to,

1160
01:03:58,140 --> 01:04:01,410
they were unable to call expert witnesses
to talk about the complexities of

1161
01:04:01,411 --> 01:04:06,411
Bitcoin and how bitcoin wallets work
and how you can hack into these.

1162
01:04:06,421 --> 01:04:10,980
It was all, it was very much
only one side. And look,

1163
01:04:10,981 --> 01:04:13,860
let's say at the end of the day, it turned
out that that side is right. We just,

1164
01:04:13,861 --> 01:04:17,250
I just don't know, like we
don't know because we never
heard the other side talk.

1165
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:21,840
So I would very much like to see the
defense have its day and if you come all

1166
01:04:21,841 --> 01:04:25,560
the way around. And the other problem
that I have is that, you know,

1167
01:04:25,561 --> 01:04:29,730
the media for the most part just sort
of swallows the party line. Like,

1168
01:04:29,731 --> 01:04:32,580
we're going to, we're going
to see silkroad movies and
they're all going to be,

1169
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:36,060
they're going to totally just take the
prosecutorial position and they're going

1170
01:04:36,061 --> 01:04:37,140
to be,
you know,

1171
01:04:37,141 --> 01:04:41,870
news reports and movies and TV shows
and they're all going to be this roguish

1172
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:46,860
hacker kid who tried to kill people
on the Internet. And, uh, again,

1173
01:04:46,861 --> 01:04:47,671
I maintain,

1174
01:04:47,671 --> 01:04:51,900
I know a fair amount about this case that
we don't totally know what happened in

1175
01:04:51,901 --> 01:04:55,680
the movie. He'll probably be sweaty and
doing math. He'll be Robert Pattinson,

1176
01:04:55,681 --> 01:04:59,520
you know, shave for a
while and yeah. Megan,

1177
01:04:59,521 --> 01:05:03,300
all such a terrible evil
choices. Yeah. Execute. Enter.

1178
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:05,940
It wasn't that like a thing?
Like he,

1179
01:05:05,950 --> 01:05:09,000
they were saying like
at one point they were,

1180
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:12,210
they wanted to beat this guy up because
he was going to talk and then they

1181
01:05:12,211 --> 01:05:14,310
decided to say execute him instead.

1182
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:18,550
And so they faked the murder and they
showed a photo of the body. Well,

1183
01:05:18,551 --> 01:05:19,510
who did all that?

1184
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:23,320
The person who did that was the undercover
agent who turns out to be corrupt.

1185
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:24,430
Oh my God.

1186
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:27,610
And he's the one who stole the money
that they were trying to sup allegedly

1187
01:05:27,611 --> 01:05:29,320
execute this person for stealing.

1188
01:05:29,350 --> 01:05:34,300
This guy had stolen money out
of fucking tangled web. It is.

1189
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:35,470
Oh my God.

1190
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:40,680
So this guy sets up a fake murder
for hire then does a fake murder,

1191
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,840
has a fake body Yup.

1192
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:49,140
All to punish this fake person
for stealing money that he stole.

1193
01:05:49,390 --> 01:05:53,350
Yes. And you need to go further. That
person that was supposedly killed,

1194
01:05:53,351 --> 01:05:55,360
who was one of the
vendors on the Silk Road,

1195
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:59,320
was then arrested as being part
of the sting operation for this,

1196
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:03,520
for this drug deal that was put together
by the crooked undercover cop who took

1197
01:06:03,521 --> 01:06:05,220
all the money and is now,
I mean,

1198
01:06:05,230 --> 01:06:09,880
his life is over and he's had to
return over and become a witness.

1199
01:06:10,210 --> 01:06:14,140
He's still has indictments pending.
They could throw him in jail at any point.

1200
01:06:14,410 --> 01:06:18,100
I mean it's, it did nothing. You know,
he was part of the Silk Road, but he,

1201
01:06:18,130 --> 01:06:23,130
this entire operation for which he was
arrested was all constructed by a corrupt

1202
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:24,183
Da.

1203
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:31,800
I guess in order to be an undercover
deh and you got to have some ability to

1204
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:37,120
work in secrecy. Yeah. But when people
start working in secrecy, they can't,

1205
01:06:37,121 --> 01:06:39,160
a little slimy. They can go rogue. Yeah.

1206
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:40,810
So you've got to keep
an eye on those people.

1207
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:45,930
I wonder if they could put a percentage
on what percentage of the transactions

1208
01:06:46,541 --> 01:06:51,541
exchanges of the conversations on Silk
Road were about illegal activities and

1209
01:06:51,881 --> 01:06:55,030
what we're not, well, I've
actually seen some pie charts, um,

1210
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:58,500
just cause I have access to some
of the metrics on this stuff. Um,

1211
01:06:59,350 --> 01:07:02,360
that show like how much was hard
drug. Like originally, you know,

1212
01:07:02,361 --> 01:07:04,640
the Silk Road had a very strict
ethics code. There was like,

1213
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:06,820
there was no child pornography,
a lot of them silk road,

1214
01:07:06,821 --> 01:07:10,520
there were no counterfeit, there's no kind
of money, a lot of them silk road. Um,

1215
01:07:10,580 --> 01:07:14,500
it, when silkroad started, it was mostly
softer drugs. It was mostly mushrooms,

1216
01:07:14,501 --> 01:07:18,430
marijuana, things like that. It grew
harder as the silk road went along,

1217
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:23,640
but also grew harder as
more law enforcement became
involved in the undercover

1218
01:07:23,711 --> 01:07:24,760
operations is Silk Road.

1219
01:07:24,761 --> 01:07:28,750
And there was a certain amount
of a complicity between the,

1220
01:07:28,751 --> 01:07:33,190
sort of the increasing law enforcement
presence on Silk Road and the severity of

1221
01:07:33,191 --> 01:07:37,230
the drugs and the, and that
kind of activity. So, I mean,
and that's just, I mean,

1222
01:07:37,231 --> 01:07:39,850
and to be fair to law enforcement,
that's often how they work anyway, right?

1223
01:07:39,851 --> 01:07:41,860
I mean,
if they're going to infiltrate a cartel,

1224
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:44,380
they're going to start moving big
amounts of heroin or whatever. I mean,

1225
01:07:44,381 --> 01:07:46,120
that's how they get in.
So it's not,

1226
01:07:46,510 --> 01:07:50,890
but it has to be looked at in terms of
the corruption of the Silk Road itself.

1227
01:07:51,310 --> 01:07:54,370
Um, it didn't start with
those kinds of intentions.

1228
01:07:55,870 --> 01:08:00,340
What a twisted web, what a
twisted web. And unfortunately,

1229
01:08:00,370 --> 01:08:04,330
if people don't watch your documentary,
what are they going to get?

1230
01:08:04,331 --> 01:08:07,690
The mainstream news narrative,
the dark web is bad.

1231
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:12,430
As bad as this guy.
Pirate Roberts is a drug dealer.

1232
01:08:12,790 --> 01:08:15,230
Murder for hire. That's
it. Back to you, Bob.

1233
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:19,640
That's what you're going to get shady
stuff. Yeah. Anyway, here in Pasadena,

1234
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:22,400
there was a Mickey mouse parade
today. Yeah. I mean, as I said,

1235
01:08:22,401 --> 01:08:26,330
I spent several hours when I was at south
by talking to a reporter from a major

1236
01:08:26,331 --> 01:08:30,050
newspaper who wanted to know what this
thing was and I talked to her for hours

1237
01:08:30,051 --> 01:08:31,970
and explain it in detail. And then
when she wrote her thing, it was like,

1238
01:08:31,971 --> 01:08:34,310
this thing is filled with criminals and
it's horrible and these people are bad

1239
01:08:34,311 --> 01:08:38,870
chick out around. Man, I can not
going to say what publication.

1240
01:08:38,871 --> 01:08:41,280
I can't say. What does it rhyme with? Uh,

1241
01:08:41,590 --> 01:08:44,750
dimes crimes in New York Times.

1242
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:49,850
So a cup to New York to find that
article. Jamie signed it. You know,

1243
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:54,440
it's, it's, that's bullshit. Nice. Why you
so nice? He want, I would be the first.

1244
01:08:54,890 --> 01:08:58,850
That's a problem. A personal life. That's
a problem. I pretended to be a reporter.

1245
01:08:58,910 --> 01:08:59,780
It's what we face.

1246
01:08:59,781 --> 01:09:03,380
I think that we face an inherent lack
of understanding and a fear and a

1247
01:09:03,381 --> 01:09:05,900
reactionary fear around these,
around technologies.

1248
01:09:05,901 --> 01:09:08,600
I think a lot of the story that's
being told about new technologies is

1249
01:09:08,601 --> 01:09:10,640
automatically criminalizing
or demonizing it.

1250
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:13,160
And then when you tell stories
that sort of sit in the middle,

1251
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:16,550
you're accused of being sort of
pollyannish and saying, oh, it's all good.

1252
01:09:16,551 --> 01:09:19,550
It's like, no, we're not saying that.
We're saying this is what's going on.

1253
01:09:19,551 --> 01:09:23,480
Whether you like it or not. Let's at
least examine it for what it is. Well,

1254
01:09:23,481 --> 01:09:27,200
how could anybody who watches your
documentary or at least listens to this

1255
01:09:27,201 --> 01:09:28,700
conversation on this podcast?

1256
01:09:29,330 --> 01:09:32,570
Not think that there's a bunch of twisted
shit going on with these undercover

1257
01:09:32,571 --> 01:09:36,800
agents that were obviously doing things
in implicating people and things that

1258
01:09:36,801 --> 01:09:41,180
they had no involvement in stealing
drugs or stealing money and blaming it on

1259
01:09:41,181 --> 01:09:44,870
others pretending to have a,
or how could someone not see all the gray?

1260
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:45,870
Because they don't want,
I don't,

1261
01:09:45,910 --> 01:09:48,600
I don't think they want gray lady
doesn't want to see that gray.

1262
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:53,900
That's outrageous. I don't think
they, you know, they don't want to,

1263
01:09:53,901 --> 01:09:54,950
but why don't they want to?

1264
01:09:54,951 --> 01:09:58,160
Cause they fucking suck as journalists
and they should be removed.

1265
01:09:58,210 --> 01:10:02,730
Replaced with independent
bloggers. Yeah. For real man. You,

1266
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:04,850
you know, until you get a, uh,

1267
01:10:04,851 --> 01:10:08,480
Glenn Greenwald type character
who doesn't have a stake in any,

1268
01:10:08,481 --> 01:10:12,920
John wants to tell the whole
fucking story. What do you
get? And even, you know, he,

1269
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:17,960
who knows, man, fuck yeah. This is,
this is God damn confusing to me.

1270
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:21,200
Yeah. And it's like in a way of, you
have to like, in order to understand it,

1271
01:10:21,201 --> 01:10:24,380
you got to really educate yourself.
There's a lot of moving parts.

1272
01:10:24,530 --> 01:10:26,000
There really are.
I mean if you really,

1273
01:10:26,001 --> 01:10:28,790
and in most people like it's much easier
just to demonize something and say, oh,

1274
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:32,870
it's bad and isn't this a situation
where the Silk Road is essentially the

1275
01:10:32,871 --> 01:10:37,250
Napster of the deep 100% and
there's going to be so already are.

1276
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:38,800
Yeah, so I mean the, the,

1277
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:43,160
the toothpaste is well out of the two
of these proliferating now there's just

1278
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:47,410
hundreds of these drug markets and
there we will just say the names and the

1279
01:10:47,411 --> 01:10:50,360
highs are so say yeah, and they're
using decentralized technologies,

1280
01:10:50,361 --> 01:10:52,790
which means there's no, just like
exactly what happened with Napster.

1281
01:10:52,850 --> 01:10:56,030
Napster was a central database, so it
was easy to, to target and shutdown.

1282
01:10:56,330 --> 01:10:58,910
Then you had a bunch of copycats like
cassava and all these other ones that were

1283
01:10:58,911 --> 01:11:01,040
also central database and
they were easy to shut down.

1284
01:11:01,310 --> 01:11:04,580
Then bit torrent came along and it was
decentralized and what that means is

1285
01:11:04,730 --> 01:11:06,530
there is no central server. The, the,

1286
01:11:06,531 --> 01:11:10,910
the system operates
through the way it's coded.

1287
01:11:10,940 --> 01:11:14,220
It works through every single user
that's online. There's nobody to target.

1288
01:11:14,430 --> 01:11:17,010
That's the reason bit torrent
never went away. Right?

1289
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:19,640
And that's what's happening in the drug
markets now as you started with these

1290
01:11:19,641 --> 01:11:24,230
central server markets, they get
clobbered that you find the server you,

1291
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:26,100
you see as the server game over.

1292
01:11:26,101 --> 01:11:29,640
And they've done it over and over
again for these copycat drug markets.

1293
01:11:29,641 --> 01:11:32,340
But now decentralized markets
are beginning to proliferate.

1294
01:11:32,490 --> 01:11:36,330
You can't shut those down. It's very,
very difficult. And there's going to be,

1295
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:39,780
there were already hundreds and
hundreds of them all over the world.

1296
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:40,920
They are going to be thousands.

1297
01:11:40,921 --> 01:11:44,100
It's just gonna grow and grow and
grow because the technology works.

1298
01:11:44,101 --> 01:11:46,230
And because as you said,
there's a demand.

1299
01:11:46,830 --> 01:11:51,240
So the real issue is going to be the
delivery of these illegal substances.

1300
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:55,470
Like you're having a hard address.
These things get delivered to them,

1301
01:11:55,471 --> 01:11:57,270
but they come through, they
come through, you know,

1302
01:11:57,271 --> 01:12:00,660
camouflage Fedex and ups packages and
these people know what they're doing and

1303
01:12:00,661 --> 01:12:02,580
they know how to game the postal
[inaudible] system. I mean,

1304
01:12:02,581 --> 01:12:05,280
I've talked to a bunch of dealers who
are using these online services and

1305
01:12:05,281 --> 01:12:07,470
they're very,
very good at working the postal system.

1306
01:12:07,710 --> 01:12:12,710
So like when you hear about
kids getting popped for having,

1307
01:12:12,781 --> 01:12:16,560
you know,
500 movies on their hard drive there,

1308
01:12:16,561 --> 01:12:19,560
they're distributing through
bittorrent and they get caught.

1309
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:25,670
This is mostly because they were one
of the ones who were uploading them,

1310
01:12:26,450 --> 01:12:28,380
right? Yeah, they got tracked.
I mean you're, if you're,

1311
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:31,320
if or if you're like a really dumb 13
year old and you're just pulling this

1312
01:12:31,321 --> 01:12:35,640
stuff down on your browser and you know
they find your Internet service provider

1313
01:12:35,641 --> 01:12:38,400
and they find your IP address and
they connect that to person who's,

1314
01:12:38,670 --> 01:12:43,530
who's broadband is sucking down and
ridiculous amounts of media every day,

1315
01:12:43,710 --> 01:12:47,190
then they can find you that way too.
There's ways of tracking you that way now,

1316
01:12:47,191 --> 01:12:48,630
but if you're buying
drugs on the internet,

1317
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:52,680
on an anonymous browser and the dark
net with bitcoin and you've kept your

1318
01:12:52,681 --> 01:12:55,740
anonymity tight working,
it's very,

1319
01:12:55,741 --> 01:12:59,250
very difficult to find you unless they
literally pop you because you're the guy

1320
01:12:59,251 --> 01:13:02,490
who sent you stuff. The packaging
wasn't well camouflage. And they go, oh,

1321
01:13:02,491 --> 01:13:04,620
look at this,
let's find out where that's going.

1322
01:13:04,621 --> 01:13:07,860
And they trace it back to its
address and they pop you. Otherwise,

1323
01:13:07,861 --> 01:13:10,080
it's very hard to check sending a,

1324
01:13:10,090 --> 01:13:14,580
you're not showing a signal like that
technology they have now where they drive

1325
01:13:14,581 --> 01:13:17,480
by people's homes and they,
um,

1326
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:22,710
they use a scanner and they
can tell whether or not
you're using massive amounts

1327
01:13:22,711 --> 01:13:24,650
of electricity. Right.
And they believe you're,

1328
01:13:24,670 --> 01:13:27,720
this is a grow house in the building or
the inside a plane over your house and

1329
01:13:27,721 --> 01:13:31,190
check for infrared. They'd been doing that
from hot farmers for, for decades. Yeah.

1330
01:13:31,410 --> 01:13:35,970
They broke into this guy's house
who was a retired NSA agent.

1331
01:13:36,450 --> 01:13:36,691
Uh,

1332
01:13:36,691 --> 01:13:41,070
him and his wife were growing tomatoes
in their basement and they fucking locked

1333
01:13:41,071 --> 01:13:45,990
him up, boots to the neck,
the whole deal. Right. And
they're like, oh, whoops. Sorry.

1334
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:50,730
You know, and this guy got a taste of what
he's a part of. Right. Like, look, hey,

1335
01:13:50,731 --> 01:13:52,320
look at this. Yeah. Well that's,

1336
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,660
that's the problem is you said
before when they're, you know,

1337
01:13:54,690 --> 01:13:57,480
my argument when people say,
well, if you have nothing to hide,

1338
01:13:57,481 --> 01:14:01,800
you have nothing to fear. The problem
is a lot of mistakes get made. A, B,

1339
01:14:01,890 --> 01:14:05,190
of course I should have privacy whether
I have something to hide or not.

1340
01:14:05,191 --> 01:14:06,720
It's none of your business what I'm doing,

1341
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:10,650
unless to a certain degree I'm creating
a crime on a level that that should be

1342
01:14:10,651 --> 01:14:12,700
enforced.
But there's so many laws,

1343
01:14:13,090 --> 01:14:16,240
there are thousands and thousands
of laws and they get very,

1344
01:14:16,570 --> 01:14:20,230
very tangled and it's very easy to,
to pop somebody for almost anything.

1345
01:14:20,650 --> 01:14:23,170
And that's where this gets
tricky when people are,

1346
01:14:23,590 --> 01:14:28,590
are infiltrating your private life with
the ability to either mistakenly or

1347
01:14:29,561 --> 01:14:32,170
through a law that you may feel like
what happened to your friend with the

1348
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:36,910
marijuana issue or what happened to the
guy who just got shot in the Carolinas

1349
01:14:36,911 --> 01:14:37,780
who had a broken tail light,

1350
01:14:37,781 --> 01:14:41,080
which isn't even against the law and
isn't really even a reason to legally stop

1351
01:14:41,081 --> 01:14:44,320
somebody. And he didn't have a prior
and he didn't have a warrant. You know,

1352
01:14:44,321 --> 01:14:45,370
that's the world we live in,

1353
01:14:45,371 --> 01:14:47,950
where these mistakes can happen
and where things can go very,

1354
01:14:47,951 --> 01:14:50,920
very wrong for people and you have to
have some protections against that.

1355
01:14:51,970 --> 01:14:55,370
What I was getting at was of this signal
doesn't exist like a signal where you

1356
01:14:55,371 --> 01:14:58,680
like passing by someone's house and you
see all this electricity being used,

1357
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:02,770
all this heat being generated.
Okay, this is a grow house. Well,

1358
01:15:02,771 --> 01:15:06,130
if you're involved in one of these many,

1359
01:15:06,131 --> 01:15:10,960
now hundreds of different
services, there's no signal.
No, there's no downloads.

1360
01:15:10,961 --> 01:15:13,870
Like if you're a guy who's
downloading massive amounts of media,

1361
01:15:14,050 --> 01:15:15,740
they look at your,
your uh,

1362
01:15:15,850 --> 01:15:18,270
the amount of data that's going
through your computer everyday.

1363
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:21,940
Look at this mother fucker right now.
He's got a terabyte, an hour. Yeah.

1364
01:15:21,970 --> 01:15:23,770
Banging into his house.
What's happening?

1365
01:15:23,830 --> 01:15:26,900
That's why law enforcement has
been trying to break tour. Um,

1366
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:29,530
and what's been going on is that,
is that tor has,

1367
01:15:29,531 --> 01:15:33,340
there's a conflict there because tourists
is still created and maintained by a

1368
01:15:33,341 --> 01:15:37,900
lot of government agencies and or
utilized let's say by a lot of government

1369
01:15:37,901 --> 01:15:40,120
agencies who need toward and you
were to communicate with each other.

1370
01:15:40,121 --> 01:15:43,900
I mean Anna say a lot of different
agencies need to communicate privately,

1371
01:15:44,110 --> 01:15:46,420
but then on the same floor of
the law enforcement building,

1372
01:15:46,421 --> 01:15:50,770
you may have some guy in office a WHO's
working to help make tore stronger four

1373
01:15:50,771 --> 01:15:51,371
doors down.

1374
01:15:51,371 --> 01:15:54,730
You've got somebody in the same building
on the same floor trying to break tour.

1375
01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:57,880
So you have this huge conflict of interest
going on where they don't even really

1376
01:15:57,881 --> 01:15:58,661
know what to do with it.

1377
01:15:58,661 --> 01:16:01,570
And the people who want to break tour
when it break it for the reason you just

1378
01:16:01,571 --> 01:16:04,600
said, how else do we identify,
how do we find these people?

1379
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:07,330
Even if tor is mostly being
used for good purposes,

1380
01:16:07,331 --> 01:16:11,710
unless we demonize the whole thing. And
that's when I get my, my hackles up.

1381
01:16:11,711 --> 01:16:13,630
When people just say
this whole world is bad,

1382
01:16:14,050 --> 01:16:17,080
they're just saying that because it's
just easier just to throw a kind of a

1383
01:16:17,081 --> 01:16:18,730
blanket over this entire world and go,

1384
01:16:18,731 --> 01:16:20,890
well now we know where all
the bad people are there.

1385
01:16:20,891 --> 01:16:22,300
Everybody who are using tour,

1386
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:24,760
which is like saying anybody
who's got a bathroom door is bad.

1387
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:30,000
It's so irresponsible to demonize the
entire Silk Road like that and demonize

1388
01:16:32,121 --> 01:16:35,460
the entire movement without looking
at the nuances. We're looking at the,

1389
01:16:35,490 --> 01:16:40,450
the unbelievable complexity involved
in freedom and digital freedom and

1390
01:16:40,451 --> 01:16:42,010
exchanging information online.

1391
01:16:42,250 --> 01:16:46,930
And even the complexities involved
in the drug war. I mean the, the,

1392
01:16:46,931 --> 01:16:51,931
the idea that just because it's a law
that you shouldn't examine that law very

1393
01:16:52,061 --> 01:16:56,410
closely and using your own personal
morals and ethics, apply them to that law.

1394
01:16:56,410 --> 01:16:58,840
And tell me whether or not
this law has just, yeah,

1395
01:16:59,010 --> 01:17:02,710
cause I guarantee you most intelligent
people will not agree with it.

1396
01:17:02,711 --> 01:17:06,650
Even Republicans completely. Yeah. It's a
nonpartisan issue. It really is. It isn't.

1397
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:08,980
People go, oh they're just crazy
libertarian. And I'm like, no they're not.

1398
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:12,000
They really aren't. It's all stripes.
I mean it's every different po,

1399
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:15,530
every kind of political configuration
as is involved in this movement on some

1400
01:17:15,531 --> 01:17:19,490
level or another cause who doesn't
want privacy? This, this documentary?

1401
01:17:19,491 --> 01:17:21,920
Where can people see it and
when can people see it? Um,

1402
01:17:21,950 --> 01:17:23,950
while we're touring festivals
right now all over it,

1403
01:17:23,951 --> 01:17:27,470
we just did south by and we're doing
festivals. So if you go to a deep web,

1404
01:17:27,471 --> 01:17:30,320
the movie.com, you can see which
festivals we're coming up on.

1405
01:17:30,321 --> 01:17:34,460
But the movies is going to be on epix.
Uh, the epics network on premium cable,

1406
01:17:34,790 --> 01:17:39,410
regular cable, right. So regular cable.
So it will be on epics on May 31st.

1407
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:44,090
Um, you can see it there and then it will
be out all over after that. And Netflix,

1408
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:48,640
Amazon, iTunes everywhere. And
we'll at Gen Norton who is, uh,

1409
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:52,460
our buddy, we'll be here on Wednesday
also has a special coming out on epic,

1410
01:17:52,461 --> 01:17:57,460
so fucking go epics, epics is
awesome. Um, was there anything, this,

1411
01:17:57,470 --> 01:18:02,470
it seems like to put a such an intense
and complex issue into a 90 minute piece,

1412
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:07,370
it seems like it'd be really hard to edit.
Yeah.

1413
01:18:07,371 --> 01:18:10,250
It was really challenging and download.
It was challenging too.

1414
01:18:10,251 --> 01:18:12,380
You have to really pick your battles,
you know,

1415
01:18:12,381 --> 01:18:15,230
and also you have to decide what is
it most important for the audience to

1416
01:18:15,231 --> 01:18:17,030
understand.
That's the way I come at them.

1417
01:18:17,031 --> 01:18:20,090
It's like their very core
issues that matter here.

1418
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:21,920
You don't need to understand
how bitcoin works.

1419
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:24,770
You don't need to understand
how tor works, what it needs.
You need to understand.

1420
01:18:25,220 --> 01:18:28,580
Thankfully the these issues to me are
not about technology. There are about,

1421
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:30,500
they're about human nature and community.

1422
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:34,070
So I always stressed the sort of
human side. What is the motivation?

1423
01:18:34,071 --> 01:18:37,280
Why did they start this thing? Who
are they? What are their ideals?

1424
01:18:37,281 --> 01:18:41,030
What kind of community do they want
to create and that you can convey to

1425
01:18:41,031 --> 01:18:42,110
somebody in 90 minutes.

1426
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:45,930
Did you have a chance to talk to this
dude that's in solitary and did you have,

1427
01:18:45,940 --> 01:18:50,690
what's his name again? Russell brick.
I have exclusive access to that family.

1428
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:53,780
The Mom, the dad, their defense
attorney. I had access to Ross,

1429
01:18:53,781 --> 01:18:56,720
but he's behind bars and a federal trial.

1430
01:18:56,721 --> 01:18:58,850
He couldn't be interviewed
by me or 60 minutes.

1431
01:18:59,210 --> 01:19:02,060
I was doing interviews with him via his,
his parents.

1432
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:05,300
So they would give him questions, like
he's very aware of the film. He would,

1433
01:19:05,301 --> 01:19:09,230
they would give him questions, uh,
and then he would answer them for me,

1434
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:14,240
um, in written form and, uh,
you know, and in some cases,

1435
01:19:14,270 --> 01:19:18,080
you know, that that was
it. Um, but, uh, uh,

1436
01:19:18,081 --> 01:19:20,770
so I was able to communicate with him
that way and sort of get, you know,

1437
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:23,120
the information that I needed to,
but what,

1438
01:19:23,121 --> 01:19:28,040
what is the rationale for not allowing him
to talk? I mean, he's, he's, uh, you know,

1439
01:19:28,110 --> 01:19:32,750
it was a big federal case and they,
they, they kept them under lock and key,

1440
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:35,720
but isn't that insane? It is pretty,
it's cool. It was chilling. Yeah.

1441
01:19:35,721 --> 01:19:37,820
I was expecting to go talk
to him, like, you know,

1442
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:40,490
at a table and vis visitation
or something that, none of that,

1443
01:19:40,830 --> 01:19:44,510
but then that's really disturbing to
me because you're not talking about a

1444
01:19:44,511 --> 01:19:49,340
murderer. Yeah. You're not talking about
a guy who was even contemplating martyr.

1445
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:51,680
He not talking about a guy
who stole a ton of money.

1446
01:19:51,810 --> 01:19:55,850
You're not talking about a guy wrecked
the government who was planning an Archi

1447
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:59,660
wanted to blow up the federal courthouse.
You're not talking about that. No.

1448
01:19:59,661 --> 01:20:00,880
But the way that,
you know,

1449
01:20:00,890 --> 01:20:04,670
the way the prosecution looks at him
to be fair is as all those things they

1450
01:20:04,671 --> 01:20:08,790
believe that they believe that Ross
intended tab people kill whether those

1451
01:20:08,791 --> 01:20:09,900
murders happened or not.

1452
01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:14,560
They believe that he made a lot of money
off of the Silk Road via bitcoin. Um,

1453
01:20:14,580 --> 01:20:15,660
they believe that,
you know,

1454
01:20:15,661 --> 01:20:20,570
this sort of antigovernment libertarian
ethos that they believe he espoused to

1455
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:24,720
was very anarchistic and dangerous.
So, you know, they did view him as a,

1456
01:20:24,721 --> 01:20:25,710
as a major threat.

1457
01:20:25,830 --> 01:20:29,830
That's a slippery slope to say that an
anti government libertarian ethos is

1458
01:20:29,910 --> 01:20:31,110
dangerous because why?

1459
01:20:31,290 --> 01:20:33,570
There's a lot of fucking people you're
going to have to lock up with that.

1460
01:20:33,630 --> 01:20:34,120
I know.

1461
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:37,200
How about Rand Paul and this
mother fuckers running for
president and that's his

1462
01:20:37,230 --> 01:20:40,430
main platform. I know. Good
luck with all that. You know,

1463
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:42,360
the guy running for government office,

1464
01:20:42,361 --> 01:20:47,190
the top government office has a dad who's
pretty goddamn libertarian for being a

1465
01:20:47,210 --> 01:20:51,330
Rep Republican. Yeah, yeah. No, it's true.
And, and I, you know, I maintained that,

1466
01:20:51,331 --> 01:20:53,630
that whatever the truth ends up being,
um,

1467
01:20:53,631 --> 01:20:57,750
and I really do hope we categorically get
to the bottom of that at some point in

1468
01:20:57,751 --> 01:21:00,330
a way, you know, and not to write
him off at all, but in a way,

1469
01:21:00,331 --> 01:21:03,690
regardless of Russell Ulbricht
I think that, you know, the,

1470
01:21:03,691 --> 01:21:07,650
the idea of these anonymous
marketplaces on the Internet with,

1471
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:10,770
with these communities,
that is the greatest threat.

1472
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:14,120
I think that's what poses
the greatest threat. Well,

1473
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:16,140
I think the Internet itself is,

1474
01:21:16,141 --> 01:21:19,230
is the greatest threat to the
system that we have in place.

1475
01:21:19,230 --> 01:21:23,760
And it's the biggest exposer of the shell
game of the two party system as well.

1476
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:28,440
Yeah. It's not, it's not viable.
And because it's not viable,

1477
01:21:28,441 --> 01:21:32,310
the data just keeps getting examined
and examined exam by so many people and

1478
01:21:32,311 --> 01:21:35,520
they keep coming to the same conclusion.
This is a fucking shell game. Yeah.

1479
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:39,180
Give the same corporations that are
there supporting the same people.

1480
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:40,200
They get into office,

1481
01:21:40,201 --> 01:21:42,930
they never do what they said they were
going to do and they do a bunch of shit

1482
01:21:42,931 --> 01:21:44,530
that you would never want them to do.
Yeah.

1483
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:46,590
So it's the same thing
over and over again.

1484
01:21:46,591 --> 01:21:49,230
And I think that ultimately
that's going to be their demise.

1485
01:21:49,231 --> 01:21:53,130
Their demise is going to be their
unwillingness to accept the new digital

1486
01:21:53,131 --> 01:21:55,830
reality. Yeah. That they're
exposed. Everything is exposed.

1487
01:21:55,831 --> 01:21:58,500
It means we're exposed to, but it
doesn't mean every that the upside is,

1488
01:21:58,501 --> 01:22:01,710
everything is, well we're not doing
anything. You're making documentaries.

1489
01:22:01,711 --> 01:22:03,470
I'm telling jokes,
but this,

1490
01:22:03,580 --> 01:22:08,580
this guy is losing a giant chunk of his
life and he's in been in jail for a year

1491
01:22:08,670 --> 01:22:11,210
and a half now. Yeah. Well he may
lose his and he may get life mean.

1492
01:22:11,211 --> 01:22:15,090
We'll know in mid May. I mean he may get
life fucking Christ and if he gets live,

1493
01:22:15,091 --> 01:22:18,960
no one can talk to him.
No. Like Chelsea Manning,

1494
01:22:18,961 --> 01:22:23,370
the artist formerly known as Bradley
Manning now has a Twitter. Yeah,

1495
01:22:23,430 --> 01:22:25,710
but how does she do that?
Yeah, it was actually what,

1496
01:22:25,711 --> 01:22:28,620
cause I started following her a couple
of days ago. I'm not until you can't,

1497
01:22:28,650 --> 01:22:32,930
there are certain people who do get like
Barrett Brown, um, had access to email.

1498
01:22:32,990 --> 01:22:35,790
He had it recently revoked so they will
claim why did he get it revoked? Oh,

1499
01:22:35,791 --> 01:22:38,970
they claimed that he was talking
to a journalist and it's all,

1500
01:22:39,060 --> 01:22:41,760
they shouldn't have revoked
it and my opinion, but um,

1501
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:45,630
he hasn't been treated fairly from the
beginning, but that's another documentary.

1502
01:22:45,710 --> 01:22:50,130
Right. Um, but uh, uh,
it's in Ross's case,

1503
01:22:50,190 --> 01:22:54,390
um, it's very difficult to
interview people under that, uh,

1504
01:22:54,420 --> 01:22:56,280
who were sort of convicted
of those kinds of chargers.

1505
01:22:56,281 --> 01:23:00,520
They often get sent to pretty
Max oriented facilities. Um,

1506
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:02,970
but I'm still working on it. I'm still
hoping to get an interview with him.

1507
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:06,130
It's basically a civilized form.
A Siberian

1508
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:10,120
gulags. Yeah. I mean it's like you just
locking you away and throw in the key.

1509
01:23:10,121 --> 01:23:14,470
They just not throwing away the key and
they're locking you away and you can't

1510
01:23:14,471 --> 01:23:17,410
talk to anybody. You're,
you're in solitary confinement,

1511
01:23:17,411 --> 01:23:20,530
which makes people go fucking
crazy. Certainly does. Yeah. I mean,

1512
01:23:20,531 --> 01:23:23,230
that's what they did with
Chelsea manning as well. Naked,

1513
01:23:23,231 --> 01:23:28,110
no clothes locked in solitary for years.
Tell me that won't make you nuts.

1514
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:29,190
It will,
it,

1515
01:23:29,190 --> 01:23:33,760
it removes so much of what you
are as a human being completely.

1516
01:23:33,850 --> 01:23:38,850
All your personal freedom is gone
and this is legal and this is morally

1517
01:23:40,991 --> 01:23:45,610
acceptable. And this is, this is a
part of the law. I mean that's insane.

1518
01:23:45,910 --> 01:23:50,800
That's fucking insane that they can
do that to this guy. So when is his,

1519
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:54,580
when did they get to see whether or
not there'll be able to appeal? Well,

1520
01:23:54,590 --> 01:23:57,070
appeals often can take about a year,
um,

1521
01:23:57,071 --> 01:23:59,290
the process of sort of dealing
with the apple at court.

1522
01:23:59,290 --> 01:24:02,860
So he's going to get sent I believe.
And again, you know, they may change,

1523
01:24:02,861 --> 01:24:07,120
but currently it's going to be sentenced
on May 15th. Um, and that's pretty cool.

1524
01:24:07,180 --> 01:24:07,991
It's around the corner.

1525
01:24:07,991 --> 01:24:12,400
And then an appeal would occur sometime
hopefully this year or at some point

1526
01:24:12,401 --> 01:24:14,790
early next year. Well,
that'll least, um, the,

1527
01:24:14,850 --> 01:24:19,720
we'll give some publicity to the
premiere of your documentary,

1528
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:21,790
which is May 31st May 31st.

1529
01:24:21,870 --> 01:24:25,620
So that'll be a couple of weeks out so
that I'm sure the buzz will still be

1530
01:24:25,930 --> 01:24:30,130
bound by. That really disturbs
me, man. I mean it really,

1531
01:24:30,131 --> 01:24:34,150
it gets me creeped out. It, it
disturbs me in a very personal level.

1532
01:24:34,151 --> 01:24:39,151
Just the idea that you could take some
young person and do that to them and not

1533
01:24:39,611 --> 01:24:44,440
let him speak. That's the key. Was
he ever able to speak on his behalf?

1534
01:24:44,470 --> 01:24:46,910
Did he get a statement or
anything? No, you have to,

1535
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:50,060
if you have to be very careful about
testifying to, you know, it's a,

1536
01:24:50,061 --> 01:24:53,590
it's a very tricky position to
put yourself in. So, um, you know,

1537
01:24:53,591 --> 01:24:56,110
it'd be interesting to see what
happens with the appeal process.

1538
01:24:57,460 --> 01:25:01,900
Are they hopeful? They have
to be? What else can, what
else can you be but hopeful.

1539
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:05,110
But legal analysts, when they look
at it from an objective standpoint,

1540
01:25:05,111 --> 01:25:07,590
people that don't have a vested
interest in success or fail,

1541
01:25:07,610 --> 01:25:11,770
they say that it's a very, they have a
very steep hill to climb to get anywhere.

1542
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:14,870
Fuck yeah.
There's,

1543
01:25:15,070 --> 01:25:18,160
how much did this bug you when
you were doing this? I mean this,

1544
01:25:18,220 --> 01:25:22,410
it got pretty depressing. I mean, there
was a point I stayed pretty neutral. Um,

1545
01:25:22,411 --> 01:25:26,560
and again, as I say, I don't know the
whole truth, I just am very eager to,

1546
01:25:26,710 --> 01:25:31,150
to either find out or to
not make proclamations about
things that I don't think

1547
01:25:31,151 --> 01:25:35,590
I've been proven, which doesn't seem
to be stopping anybody else. But, um,

1548
01:25:36,190 --> 01:25:38,530
there was a point when I was
sitting in the federal trial and,

1549
01:25:38,531 --> 01:25:42,430
and just watching them get blocked and
blocked and blocked and in everyone in

1550
01:25:42,431 --> 01:25:46,270
that room just wanted to hear at
least something from the other side.

1551
01:25:46,300 --> 01:25:49,510
And you know, at the point at which
I suddenly realized that was it,

1552
01:25:49,511 --> 01:25:54,450
the trial was over. It was very,
I mean, I, I said to, to Ross,

1553
01:25:54,451 --> 01:25:58,300
his mom, you know, later that day I
was like, I don't know how, I mean,

1554
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:01,090
I've always wondered how you've
survived the last year, but like,

1555
01:26:01,270 --> 01:26:04,010
I barely made it through
this week and it's

1556
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:04,970
not my son in jail.

1557
01:26:04,971 --> 01:26:08,450
And even if he's guilty of everything and
just on a pure emotional level just to

1558
01:26:08,451 --> 01:26:13,240
watch, you know, the machinery and
the way that it works. And, and, uh,

1559
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:16,500
it was just very, it's very, very sad.
I mean, the whole, the whole case is, I,

1560
01:26:16,501 --> 01:26:20,120
I find extremely sad.
Whatever the truth turns out to be,

1561
01:26:20,121 --> 01:26:23,720
just on a basic human level,
it was a pretty emotional experience.

1562
01:26:23,810 --> 01:26:28,810
And is there any movement whatsoever to
try to reform this kind of railroading

1563
01:26:30,230 --> 01:26:33,200
of people? I mean, to be honest with you,
a few things are going on as you know,

1564
01:26:33,201 --> 01:26:36,530
that it's mostly state level, mandatory
minimums are starting to get reduced.

1565
01:26:36,531 --> 01:26:37,550
I mean,
the world,

1566
01:26:37,620 --> 01:26:42,620
the world is moving slowly
towards w beyond this prohibition.

1567
01:26:43,220 --> 01:26:43,521
Right.

1568
01:26:43,521 --> 01:26:46,790
And I think that we're getting there and
I think that the Internet has actually

1569
01:26:46,791 --> 01:26:50,780
been really helpful in sort of creating
grassroots movement that then attack

1570
01:26:50,781 --> 01:26:53,570
things that are, you know, a Byzantine,

1571
01:26:53,571 --> 01:26:56,840
like the gay marriage laws or the
marijuana laws or these things that are

1572
01:26:56,841 --> 01:26:59,090
beginning to shift in our culture.

1573
01:26:59,090 --> 01:27:02,910
And I think that the net is
absolutely a power there. Um,

1574
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:07,910
but there's a very big battle,
you know, against that tide.

1575
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:11,480
Um, and that's largely at
the federal level. And, um,

1576
01:27:11,481 --> 01:27:15,520
and so I think we have a long way
to go before we're having, um,

1577
01:27:16,010 --> 01:27:19,520
conversations that are sane and balanced
and nuanced about any of those stuff,

1578
01:27:19,521 --> 01:27:20,690
which very black and white,

1579
01:27:20,691 --> 01:27:24,050
you go out into the world and you say
things about this world that aren't

1580
01:27:24,170 --> 01:27:27,440
completely party line and you're just
branded as being a tin foil hat wearing

1581
01:27:27,441 --> 01:27:31,620
crackpot. And is that how you've been
branded? No, I mean not. I think, well a,

1582
01:27:31,621 --> 01:27:32,840
the movie hasn't come out yet,
but you know,

1583
01:27:32,870 --> 01:27:35,810
I sort of comically caught
some heat on downloaded as,

1584
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:39,350
I don't think I talked enough about piracy
for some people's liking on download.

1585
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:42,290
Yeah. That was the Napster movie that I
made. And I think that people, you know,

1586
01:27:42,380 --> 01:27:46,970
they expected to have a much more
about like how bad it was to pull down

1587
01:27:46,971 --> 01:27:50,570
Metallica. And I was just with not
that interested in that stuff. Um,

1588
01:27:51,260 --> 01:27:54,720
and I think that that if you don't
follow the sort of, you know,

1589
01:27:54,860 --> 01:27:59,510
standard narrative, um, you take some
heat. I don't care. I like you said,

1590
01:27:59,511 --> 01:28:02,000
I'm the guy who makes documentaries.
I have, I'm not going to jail.

1591
01:28:02,001 --> 01:28:04,400
I'm not selling anything on the
unit. You know what I mean? I'm, I'm,

1592
01:28:04,940 --> 01:28:06,950
I'm objectively removed from that world.

1593
01:28:06,951 --> 01:28:11,210
But of course you take heat because
people get really pissed off at the idea

1594
01:28:11,570 --> 01:28:16,070
that you're not just saying, you
know, hiding bad piracy, bad drugs,

1595
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:19,130
bad, you know, it says you have
to just take that party line.

1596
01:28:19,131 --> 01:28:21,950
Like that reporter I talked to
and it's just, it's disappointing.

1597
01:28:21,951 --> 01:28:25,190
But that's the prevailing narrative and
it's not just the narrative from the

1598
01:28:25,191 --> 01:28:27,860
right. You get that from the
left, you get it from the center.

1599
01:28:27,861 --> 01:28:31,040
Everyone just sort of marches in line.
Yeah.

1600
01:28:31,041 --> 01:28:35,510
They've watched dragnet when they were
kids and this idea that is good and evil

1601
01:28:35,511 --> 01:28:38,390
and good guys and bad guys
just catch the bad guys.

1602
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:40,880
This is a freedom issue and in my opinion,

1603
01:28:40,970 --> 01:28:43,400
if you look at the worst
thing that happened,

1604
01:28:43,700 --> 01:28:47,960
people distributed drugs to each
other that wanted those drugs.

1605
01:28:48,230 --> 01:28:50,630
That's the worst thing that happened.
Obviously if they're,

1606
01:28:50,870 --> 01:28:55,850
the murders were faked and
it's quite possible, in fact,

1607
01:28:55,851 --> 01:28:59,420
likely that no one ever wanted
anybody murdered in the first place.

1608
01:28:59,421 --> 01:29:02,430
This guy just was setting the whole thing
to cover up the fact that he stole all

1609
01:29:02,431 --> 01:29:04,800
this money. It's like, where's the crime?

1610
01:29:04,801 --> 01:29:07,800
Where's the crime that you're protecting
the world from that you've got this

1611
01:29:07,801 --> 01:29:11,910
fucking guy locked up in jail and is a
part of the reason why they're able to

1612
01:29:11,911 --> 01:29:16,020
keep him in solitary? The murder for hire.
Yeah. He's having to be clear. He was,

1613
01:29:16,021 --> 01:29:18,660
he's no longer in solitary.
He wasn't set when they first caught him,

1614
01:29:18,690 --> 01:29:21,840
and it's not uncommon, it's called
the shoe he was put into the shoe,

1615
01:29:21,870 --> 01:29:25,930
which is a solitary confinement.
It's a nasty sort of environment to be,

1616
01:29:25,931 --> 01:29:27,570
and he was in solitary for six weeks.

1617
01:29:27,571 --> 01:29:30,650
He has not been in solitary for the
bulk of his confinement. Oh, I was kids,

1618
01:29:30,660 --> 01:29:32,160
not like Chelsea manning in that way.

1619
01:29:32,161 --> 01:29:36,480
He's been in a holding a prison
in Brooklyn for over a year.

1620
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:37,553
He did,
uh,

1621
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:41,250
some solitary and stay in Oakland and
then he did some solitary in New York.

1622
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:45,400
He's been primarily part of the regular
prison system and in the regular prison

1623
01:29:45,420 --> 01:29:49,680
prison system. What type of security
does or they have because it's intense.

1624
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:53,770
It's intense, but z locked up with
murderers or is he? Yeah, he's in,

1625
01:29:53,790 --> 01:29:57,690
he's in the general these in the general
population far he's done. I mean,

1626
01:29:57,691 --> 01:30:00,060
you know, again, you know, not
to exonerate him, but he's,

1627
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:02,220
he's been a pretty interesting inmate.

1628
01:30:02,221 --> 01:30:05,780
He's been teaching like physics
and Yoga and presenting,

1629
01:30:05,781 --> 01:30:09,330
but teaching math and helping the guys
with the GDS like you know, again,

1630
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:13,650
this is just who he is. He, he may have
done horrible other things that we,

1631
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:16,910
you know, we'll learn about
more detail at some point, but,

1632
01:30:17,180 --> 01:30:20,430
but what we know about what
he has exactly. He seems
like a pretty, God damn cool.

1633
01:30:20,431 --> 01:30:24,660
He's an interesting guy. Yeah. That's just
drives me nuts man. How do you, when you,

1634
01:30:24,750 --> 01:30:25,770
when you were done with this,

1635
01:30:25,771 --> 01:30:30,090
when you did the final edit and you
a step back and you, you, you know,

1636
01:30:30,330 --> 01:30:34,470
you're done. Now it's just about
talking it about it, promoting it.

1637
01:30:34,471 --> 01:30:38,940
And what does this leave you feeling when
you make a documentary about something

1638
01:30:38,941 --> 01:30:41,690
like this? You go through
withdrawal. You know, I'm,

1639
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:44,400
I'm actually through it now cause
I've been done for a minute, but, um,

1640
01:30:44,401 --> 01:30:47,640
you go through a little withdrawal
because it's, it, I was, I was living,

1641
01:30:47,641 --> 01:30:51,470
eating and sleeping this world for
almost two years and, and as you know,

1642
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:54,600
I was dealing with a lot of people on
all sides, on the law enforcement side,

1643
01:30:54,601 --> 01:30:58,320
on the cyber side, the whole,
his family, the whole thing.

1644
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:02,430
You got to go through withdrawal.
But pardon me? And I said this,

1645
01:31:02,431 --> 01:31:05,970
I was very blunt with Lynn, his mom, um,
and I like being able to talk about it.

1646
01:31:05,971 --> 01:31:08,760
So that's kind of the easy part cause
that's kind of the why you do it part.

1647
01:31:08,761 --> 01:31:13,080
Right. Um, but I said to
Lynn, I was like, you know, I,

1648
01:31:13,860 --> 01:31:17,070
I really am glad I'm done. You
know, it's like I get to gut,

1649
01:31:17,071 --> 01:31:18,690
you don't get to go home.
You know,

1650
01:31:19,020 --> 01:31:23,780
I got a family and kids and like I get
to go home and I'm done and it's a very,

1651
01:31:24,030 --> 01:31:25,080
I really,
you know,

1652
01:31:25,081 --> 01:31:28,170
you'd go outside and you smell the air
and you get in your car and you go about

1653
01:31:28,171 --> 01:31:32,250
your day and you take your kids to school.
And I think, you know, I just, I don't,

1654
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:33,570
I am done with that world.

1655
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:38,160
Well that's this really scary part about
the threat of keeping in line is that

1656
01:31:38,161 --> 01:31:39,870
they can remove that from you.

1657
01:31:40,230 --> 01:31:43,980
They can take that right away from you
to just drive. Right now he can go,

1658
01:31:44,550 --> 01:31:47,640
go get a burrito. I want to drive down
the street to the Mexican restaurant.

1659
01:31:47,641 --> 01:31:51,630
I want to, you know, do this. I want to
go to big bear and just take a day off.

1660
01:31:51,660 --> 01:31:55,050
You can't do that. None of that. None
of those are options anymore. Yeah.

1661
01:31:55,051 --> 01:31:58,500
And even if you're, even if you're
the family or whoever, you know,

1662
01:31:58,530 --> 01:32:00,130
your life is shattered too.
I mean,

1663
01:32:00,131 --> 01:32:04,240
Lynn doesn't get to go home and have
a regular life anymore now on her son.

1664
01:32:04,241 --> 01:32:06,900
Her baby is always going to
be in a cage somewhere. Yeah.

1665
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:12,040
Was there any sympathy from people that
you talk to even off the record in law

1666
01:32:12,041 --> 01:32:14,710
enforcement that, yeah. Oh,
sure. Yeah, absolutely. Um,

1667
01:32:14,711 --> 01:32:18,070
I mean a lot of the law enforcement people
that I spoke to and some of whom are

1668
01:32:18,071 --> 01:32:21,380
in the movie, we're really the same
thing I went through with Nafta,

1669
01:32:21,420 --> 01:32:24,370
with the labels. It's like Tim, like
again, to me it's not black and white.

1670
01:32:24,371 --> 01:32:25,810
It's not good guys and bad guys.

1671
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:29,080
Most of the label guys you had talked
to were really clear eyed and smart and

1672
01:32:29,081 --> 01:32:31,360
had a really good view of like,
here's where we screwed up.

1673
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:33,590
Here's where we taking too much money.
Here's where this happened,

1674
01:32:33,820 --> 01:32:37,210
here's what the technology fucked us,
whatever it was on law enforcement.

1675
01:32:37,211 --> 01:32:40,240
Most of the law enforcement guys I talked
to don't agree with this notion that

1676
01:32:40,241 --> 01:32:42,670
there should be no encryption. They're
like, of course. It's like, yes,

1677
01:32:42,671 --> 01:32:46,450
it's going to make our job harder. But
yes, you have a right to privacy. No,

1678
01:32:46,451 --> 01:32:48,810
we should not have warrantless
search and seizure. That makes,

1679
01:32:48,811 --> 01:32:51,850
that makes no sense. And
you know the, so there is,

1680
01:32:51,851 --> 01:32:53,560
there's a lot of people
caught up in the grades.

1681
01:32:53,561 --> 01:32:55,450
There was another guy I
spoke to in the movie,

1682
01:32:55,930 --> 01:32:59,560
a named Neil Franklin who is the
director of an organization called law

1683
01:32:59,561 --> 01:33:01,000
enforcement against prohibition.

1684
01:33:01,300 --> 01:33:04,930
And Neil was a homicide major on the
streets of Baltimore for 20 years and saw

1685
01:33:04,931 --> 01:33:09,100
everything there was to see about the
drug wars ravages and now his life,

1686
01:33:09,220 --> 01:33:14,200
his work is about getting rid of
the drug war from the officer side,

1687
01:33:14,201 --> 01:33:16,630
from the Dea, FBI, Dea side.

1688
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:20,350
So I just feel like in the future it's
going to be looked back the same way

1689
01:33:20,351 --> 01:33:21,400
prohibition was,

1690
01:33:21,430 --> 01:33:25,000
it's just going to be looked back at
like some ridiculous part of our history

1691
01:33:25,001 --> 01:33:28,660
that we should have been intelligent
enough to realize it was a foolhardy

1692
01:33:28,661 --> 01:33:33,010
pursuit. And Yeah, we've abandoned that.
Yeah, no, there's fucking bars everywhere.

1693
01:33:33,011 --> 01:33:35,080
I mean you just drive down the street.
Everywhere you go,

1694
01:33:35,081 --> 01:33:38,280
you can buy booze and those, those
bars have parking lots. Yeah.

1695
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:42,370
And a boot pay taxes go to them
so it supports the economy.

1696
01:33:42,790 --> 01:33:44,640
The whole thing is bizarre.
It's is,

1697
01:33:44,641 --> 01:33:49,420
it's such a weird thing when you look at
our culture and you look at these just

1698
01:33:49,450 --> 01:33:54,450
glaring flaws and how we operate and the
justice system in this respect is one

1699
01:33:56,321 --> 01:34:00,580
of those glaring flaws. When you tell
me about that trial, it makes me sick.

1700
01:34:00,581 --> 01:34:04,540
Like I physically feel sick. Yeah. It
was sick making. It really was. He just,

1701
01:34:04,541 --> 01:34:05,440
it was kind of dizzying.

1702
01:34:05,441 --> 01:34:08,710
You just thought really it was like being
in a Kafka novel. You're like, really?

1703
01:34:08,860 --> 01:34:11,620
That's it? That's it. We
go home. It makes no sense.

1704
01:34:11,621 --> 01:34:14,800
It almost makes sense when you hear
about that judge and penalty Pennsylvania

1705
01:34:14,801 --> 01:34:19,480
that was sensing those kids for profit.
Like you kind of get it now. Yeah. I go,

1706
01:34:19,481 --> 01:34:23,110
well, if you guys are just used to doing
this and that becomes just another step

1707
01:34:23,111 --> 01:34:27,850
removed from the normal
operating procedure. Like, Hey,
what's the big deal? Yeah,

1708
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:31,780
I need a pool. You know,
ah, what's the big deal?

1709
01:34:31,781 --> 01:34:34,650
I'd like to go on vacation and
fuck some kid's life up. Yeah.

1710
01:34:34,870 --> 01:34:38,060
And there's also the general
aspect of like, we need, you know,

1711
01:34:38,170 --> 01:34:40,810
to punish the drug war. We need
to do it in a big way. We need to,

1712
01:34:40,930 --> 01:34:43,000
we need to do it in a public way.
You know,

1713
01:34:43,001 --> 01:34:45,750
we need to do it with maximum
punishment where the, you know,

1714
01:34:45,790 --> 01:34:47,710
extreme prejudice as it were.
So there's that.

1715
01:34:47,860 --> 01:34:50,020
You watched that machinery
just at work too.

1716
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:52,750
They get to go back in front
of the teak DV cameras and go,

1717
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:56,980
we have another big drug war trophy
and this dread pirate Roberts.

1718
01:34:57,550 --> 01:35:00,140
He started,
whether it's this Guy Ross or not,

1719
01:35:00,290 --> 01:35:05,290
he started talking because there's another
competing sort of deep web service.

1720
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:11,090
Yeah. Well the, at back at the time
there was, um, there was another,

1721
01:35:11,091 --> 01:35:13,590
there was one called Atlantis
that had shown up that was used.

1722
01:35:13,610 --> 01:35:17,300
Now there's tons of them, but this was
in the early days. And you know, the,

1723
01:35:17,301 --> 01:35:19,670
the journalist from wire where
the journalist from wired,

1724
01:35:19,671 --> 01:35:21,800
Andy Greenberg who sort of
the main kind of, you know,

1725
01:35:21,801 --> 01:35:25,100
he's our every man in the film who
takes us through this world. Um,

1726
01:35:25,101 --> 01:35:27,980
he was the only the first person to
interview really the only person to

1727
01:35:27,981 --> 01:35:29,090
interview dread pirate Roberts.

1728
01:35:29,091 --> 01:35:31,190
And that's how he got the
interview was just by saying, look,

1729
01:35:31,191 --> 01:35:32,600
I'll cover these other guys.

1730
01:35:32,930 --> 01:35:36,020
And Dread Pirate Roberts knew that the
silkroad needed more exposure in order to

1731
01:35:36,021 --> 01:35:40,720
get more customers. So he talked.
Wow. And so no one from Atlanta was,

1732
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:43,790
Eric got popped. Atlanta has got
complete, like Atlanta disappeared.

1733
01:35:43,810 --> 01:35:46,310
Atlanta Scott popped
in evaporated ages ago.

1734
01:35:46,340 --> 01:35:49,380
So the government came in and full
training, we don't know, just to just,

1735
01:35:49,410 --> 01:35:53,150
it just disappeared. Like a lot of what
happens with a lot of these services is,

1736
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:56,330
is they'll just take all of the,
they'll extort people, they'll,

1737
01:35:56,331 --> 01:35:59,330
they'll collect all their money and then
they'll, they'll just hightail it. Oh,

1738
01:35:59,331 --> 01:36:03,920
so the guys who own the
service can be shady. Yeah. Oh,
completely think, yeah, that,

1739
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:06,620
that happens, that it just happened
with one called evolution recently.

1740
01:36:06,620 --> 01:36:09,230
And it happened with another one called
sheet market and it happens from time to

1741
01:36:09,231 --> 01:36:11,930
time. I'm confused where,
how are they getting money?

1742
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:16,070
It's what you do is you set up an
account and get bitcoin when you can use

1743
01:36:16,100 --> 01:36:19,610
bitcoin, you know overstock.com takes
Bitcoin, you can use bitcoin like paypal.

1744
01:36:19,611 --> 01:36:22,610
Sure. Um, and you set up an account,

1745
01:36:22,611 --> 01:36:26,330
then you go to that site through tour,
through some other way into the dark net.

1746
01:36:26,630 --> 01:36:30,080
You set up a username and an account
just like you do with Ebay, right?

1747
01:36:30,081 --> 01:36:34,220
And now you have a bitcoin account and
you've got your account on this site just

1748
01:36:34,221 --> 01:36:35,054
like you've Ebay.

1749
01:36:35,210 --> 01:36:38,660
So it's just like using paypal to
pay to pay for your Ebay purchases.

1750
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:43,840
You're using bitcoin to pay for your
online services and they have access

1751
01:36:44,571 --> 01:36:47,110
somehow or another to your bitcoin.
Because bitcoin is,

1752
01:36:47,111 --> 01:36:50,060
is anonymous in the sense that
you can set up a bitcoin address,

1753
01:36:50,061 --> 01:36:54,170
but all they're getting is the code
for your bitcoin. And it gives removed.

1754
01:36:54,171 --> 01:36:57,350
Like there's ways to remove it from you
even further. It was called tumbling,

1755
01:36:57,710 --> 01:37:01,280
but basically you,
you pay using this bitcoin code,

1756
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:03,890
they get that transaction,

1757
01:37:04,340 --> 01:37:07,820
they send you the drugs via an
oftentimes now it works. There's,

1758
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:09,410
they don't even know who you are,

1759
01:37:09,411 --> 01:37:13,580
like it's done through a third party
to separate you from the course site.

1760
01:37:13,581 --> 01:37:15,500
So there's ways of keeping it,
you know,

1761
01:37:15,501 --> 01:37:17,480
they basically was like an
escrow account or sending,

1762
01:37:17,481 --> 01:37:20,300
there's ways of of key creating
barriers between you and them.

1763
01:37:20,630 --> 01:37:21,920
So somehow or another,

1764
01:37:21,921 --> 01:37:26,210
the people that own this site are able
to access the people who have membership

1765
01:37:26,211 --> 01:37:30,830
on the site, their bitcoin wallet.
Exactly. So they just steal from them? No,

1766
01:37:30,831 --> 01:37:32,840
it doesn't work that way. They don't
have access to their bitcoin wallet.

1767
01:37:32,870 --> 01:37:35,120
What they're doing is,
let's say we're buying,

1768
01:37:35,121 --> 01:37:36,890
let's say we're buying
lots of stuff on your site.

1769
01:37:36,980 --> 01:37:39,080
All of these different people
are buying stuff on your site.

1770
01:37:39,081 --> 01:37:43,310
You're the middleman, right? Because
you're connecting buyer to seller. Right.

1771
01:37:43,790 --> 01:37:45,440
You give me money for me,

1772
01:37:45,441 --> 01:37:47,750
just like Amazon that I'm
supposed to give to the seller.

1773
01:37:47,990 --> 01:37:50,450
I wait until that money collects,
collects, collects, collects,

1774
01:37:50,510 --> 01:37:54,830
and then I just close up shop. I just cut
both of you guys off. Buyer and seller.

1775
01:37:54,831 --> 01:37:57,330
Bye. I've got all the cash that's
sitting here in the middle.

1776
01:37:57,331 --> 01:38:00,720
So you're the third party middle man
that's supposed to hand it over. Exam one,

1777
01:38:00,721 --> 01:38:03,730
handed it over, you just grab
it and run first I shut down.

1778
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:08,240
They shut the whole thing down. And so
is there a delay in transactional runs?

1779
01:38:08,250 --> 01:38:12,370
Exactly. Yeah. Cause you're taking a fee.
So there's, there's that whole space.

1780
01:38:12,371 --> 01:38:16,380
So people are creating decentralized
systems now that are not about that,

1781
01:38:16,410 --> 01:38:19,740
but don't even have fee based
structures where that won't be possible.

1782
01:38:19,890 --> 01:38:21,750
We're basically all I've done,

1783
01:38:21,751 --> 01:38:24,150
it's more like bit torn is all
I've done is created the service.

1784
01:38:24,151 --> 01:38:27,720
I put it out in the world, it's
decentralized. There is no middleman,

1785
01:38:27,930 --> 01:38:31,560
the bitcoins or travels from one
area through directly to that buyer.

1786
01:38:31,770 --> 01:38:34,050
There was nobody in the middle
that can take the money and run.

1787
01:38:34,290 --> 01:38:36,410
And that's the direction
it's currently going in.

1788
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:39,840
So these people that did it like
for Atlantis or these other organs,

1789
01:38:40,060 --> 01:38:42,810
do they ever get caught or does everybody
have to shut up because they were

1790
01:38:42,811 --> 01:38:45,540
talking about illegal drugs. But they get,
most of them don't get caught. I mean,

1791
01:38:45,541 --> 01:38:47,730
the interesting thing is there's
a lot of, you know, full blown,

1792
01:38:47,790 --> 01:38:49,980
unsurprisingly full on
cyber criminals out there.

1793
01:38:49,981 --> 01:38:52,860
Like these DEA agents that got caught.
They were actually,

1794
01:38:52,861 --> 01:38:57,090
or this singular DEA agent singular
see secret service guy. You know,

1795
01:38:57,091 --> 01:38:58,290
they were very sophisticated.

1796
01:38:58,290 --> 01:39:01,260
They were more sophisticated than some
of the guys who created these sites.

1797
01:39:01,261 --> 01:39:03,750
They knew how to use bitcoin.
They were creating,

1798
01:39:03,780 --> 01:39:05,970
they were actually
creating bitcoin exchanges.

1799
01:39:05,971 --> 01:39:10,860
They were very technologically together.
So you have people like that, um,

1800
01:39:11,220 --> 01:39:12,570
on the cyber side as well,

1801
01:39:12,571 --> 01:39:15,660
who were like hackers and really know
how to manipulate these technologies.

1802
01:39:15,661 --> 01:39:19,020
They've been in the game a long time.
And they'll create fictitious users.

1803
01:39:19,021 --> 01:39:22,290
They'll create markets, they'll buy their
time. Then they'll steal people's money.

1804
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:24,930
It's the wild west.
Wow.

1805
01:39:25,020 --> 01:39:30,020
So now the way they're doing it is
how decentralized and centralized.

1806
01:39:30,270 --> 01:39:33,600
Yeah. So what that is, is he's basically,
there is no central point of control.

1807
01:39:33,601 --> 01:39:34,760
There's no central servers.

1808
01:39:34,761 --> 01:39:39,150
So there is no guy in the middle who's
whole means there's no profit either.

1809
01:39:39,151 --> 01:39:42,360
There's no one taking a fee.
It's really a gala Terrian.

1810
01:39:42,361 --> 01:39:46,020
There's one technology that's on
the rise now called open bazaar.

1811
01:39:46,020 --> 01:39:48,510
And this is not,
was not created for drug use.

1812
01:39:48,511 --> 01:39:52,440
There may be drugs and end up getting cell
in a bizarre, bizarre, bizarre, bizarre,

1813
01:39:52,720 --> 01:39:57,510
bizarre. And Open bazaar is you can
buy shoes that you could buy whatever,

1814
01:39:57,720 --> 01:40:00,360
but it's decentralized.
There's no central point of control.

1815
01:40:00,870 --> 01:40:03,210
So it's not a profit
based entity in that way.

1816
01:40:03,211 --> 01:40:06,300
Eventually if they wanted to create like
some kind of like what bit torrent is

1817
01:40:06,301 --> 01:40:10,260
trying to do. Yeah. If they wanted to
create some kind of advertising model or,

1818
01:40:10,270 --> 01:40:13,890
or legitimize himself and other ways,
there's ways to eventually create profit.

1819
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:18,300
So, and they're also saying that not
only are people using this for drugs,

1820
01:40:18,301 --> 01:40:22,260
but they're also using this for illegal
firearms and the distribution of illegal

1821
01:40:22,261 --> 01:40:24,290
firearm. That's really uncommon. The,

1822
01:40:24,510 --> 01:40:27,840
it's really hard to sell drugs
on the dark on the dark net.

1823
01:40:27,841 --> 01:40:30,530
People have tried ones. Y'All
guns, I'm sorry. Um, it's,

1824
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:34,200
it's very difficult given the way.
There's a number of issues,

1825
01:40:34,201 --> 01:40:36,180
but given the difficulty of moving,

1826
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:41,340
moving drugs or guns around through the
postal system is extremely difficult.

1827
01:40:41,700 --> 01:40:44,250
The one thing that did happen,
I'm on the Internet,

1828
01:40:44,251 --> 01:40:47,310
is what Cody Wilson was doing and
he created the three d printed gun,

1829
01:40:47,580 --> 01:40:50,070
which you may have heard
of Cody's in my movie. And,

1830
01:40:50,100 --> 01:40:54,130
and Cody again is coming
from a purely perspective.

1831
01:40:54,131 --> 01:40:55,810
He is just trying to say,
look,

1832
01:40:56,500 --> 01:41:00,160
technology is allowing people
to do whatever they want,
screw your laws. Right.

1833
01:41:00,190 --> 01:41:04,150
So that's the way that, that some
of that stuff has happened online,

1834
01:41:04,151 --> 01:41:08,530
but the way Cody's technologies work
is you're able to create one piece of a

1835
01:41:08,531 --> 01:41:13,030
weapon that you could sort of build
the rest of the weapon around. Um,

1836
01:41:13,031 --> 01:41:17,830
so that's been a big thorn in
people's sides as well. Yeah.

1837
01:41:17,831 --> 01:41:20,320
He, what he's done is
very interesting. Um,

1838
01:41:20,321 --> 01:41:23,620
because his plans or the,

1839
01:41:23,650 --> 01:41:26,200
whatever it is for the three d gun,

1840
01:41:26,230 --> 01:41:30,700
you could download hundreds of thousands
of people have downloaded this and

1841
01:41:30,701 --> 01:41:34,210
traded it back and forth. Yeah.
And if you have a three d printer,

1842
01:41:34,450 --> 01:41:37,390
all you have to do is
enter that information in.

1843
01:41:37,450 --> 01:41:41,480
And it can build you this
gun. Yeah. I mean you need a
Miller. You need like some,

1844
01:41:41,490 --> 01:41:42,000
he's the,

1845
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:45,670
the next wave of his technology was
actually selling the milling machine that

1846
01:41:45,671 --> 01:41:50,620
would allow it to be metal.
Um, so it's, it's definitely,

1847
01:41:50,650 --> 01:41:52,490
he's a very provocative guy.
Well,

1848
01:41:52,491 --> 01:41:57,370
it seems like that's kind of where we're
going as human beings with technology

1849
01:41:57,371 --> 01:42:01,330
in this is not stores where you
have to go and pick something up,

1850
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:05,920
but you just print it. You just make
it. Yeah. That seems to happen. Yeah.

1851
01:42:06,220 --> 01:42:09,100
Even with food. Yeah. You can
three d print food. Whoa. Yeah.

1852
01:42:09,101 --> 01:42:11,980
You're getting ingredients and
you can literally make food,

1853
01:42:12,580 --> 01:42:14,440
like what kind of food?
All kinds of stuff.

1854
01:42:14,441 --> 01:42:16,690
And it just going to get more
advanced all the time. I mean,

1855
01:42:16,691 --> 01:42:19,780
there's organic elements to this.
It's not just like plastic stuff.

1856
01:42:20,110 --> 01:42:23,140
So it's so strange. Yeah. I remember
when I was talking to Shawn Fanning,

1857
01:42:23,180 --> 01:42:25,750
the guy who created an APP store, and I
was talking to Sean about 10 years ago,

1858
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:29,410
this is a 10 years ago. I was like,
okay, what's the next big thing?

1859
01:42:29,411 --> 01:42:31,360
It was like three d printing.
He goes,

1860
01:42:31,361 --> 01:42:35,200
people have no idea how much that's going
to change our culture once it really

1861
01:42:35,201 --> 01:42:39,280
gets going. It seems like it is. It seems
like you, when you buy a new iPhone,

1862
01:42:39,281 --> 01:42:42,430
you're gonna, you're gonna download
the directions for the iPhone.

1863
01:42:42,440 --> 01:42:44,580
They don't even have to do that. Yeah.
You just stick the code and your,

1864
01:42:44,650 --> 01:42:49,230
it'll just make it, you know,
Jesus Christ. It seems like the,

1865
01:42:49,231 --> 01:42:52,930
the real issue will be raw materials then
at that. I think the world is really,

1866
01:42:52,931 --> 01:42:54,580
I mean that's the thing
I maintain is that,

1867
01:42:54,581 --> 01:42:57,550
that's why I get so frustrated by how
slow we're dragging our feet with these

1868
01:42:57,551 --> 01:43:00,700
changes. It's like you said it
earlier, the real changes are coming.

1869
01:43:00,701 --> 01:43:04,630
Like the things that are really going
to shift into high gear over the next 10

1870
01:43:04,631 --> 01:43:08,740
2030 years with driverless cars and
more advanced bio technology. I mean,

1871
01:43:08,741 --> 01:43:12,150
things are really going to change.
They're so weird because we're,

1872
01:43:12,210 --> 01:43:13,510
we're in the middle of it.

1873
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:18,370
I think it's so difficult to gain a really
objective perspective while you were

1874
01:43:18,371 --> 01:43:19,350
in the middle of it.
Yeah,

1875
01:43:19,420 --> 01:43:22,690
because everyone's used to just looking
at their phone and checking their text

1876
01:43:22,691 --> 01:43:27,250
messages, but since 30 years
ago, that wasn't even a dream.

1877
01:43:27,251 --> 01:43:31,930
Now completely, their computer in your
hand was unheard of. It's all weird. Yeah.

1878
01:43:32,050 --> 01:43:33,910
It's all weird and it's shifting,

1879
01:43:34,090 --> 01:43:38,410
but what it is to be a person is going
to be very different. It is. Yeah, it is.

1880
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:41,380
I just wonder how they're going
to look back on things like this,

1881
01:43:41,381 --> 01:43:43,960
like this silk road thing
or Napster. Well, you've,

1882
01:43:43,961 --> 01:43:48,340
you've really kind of captured with both
of these documentaries with downloaded

1883
01:43:48,341 --> 01:43:49,960
in with his deep web documentary,

1884
01:43:49,961 --> 01:43:54,740
you really kind of captured two
very pivotal blips culturally.

1885
01:43:55,010 --> 01:43:58,250
Yeah, that's been my interest is
like where's the gray? Where are the,

1886
01:43:58,251 --> 01:44:01,550
where are the uneasy where you know,
what's not the low hanging fruit,

1887
01:44:01,610 --> 01:44:03,530
like that's what's been interest.
That's what I've been,

1888
01:44:03,560 --> 01:44:07,460
that's been my agenda in and going
after these stories is like what are,

1889
01:44:07,490 --> 01:44:10,850
what doesn't have easy answers?
Has it been really frustrating though?

1890
01:44:10,851 --> 01:44:14,750
Like especially like this New York Times
person that you don't want to name,

1891
01:44:15,140 --> 01:44:18,230
we'll find her or him,
whoever they are.

1892
01:44:18,860 --> 01:44:20,900
You said it was her too late.

1893
01:44:22,130 --> 01:44:27,050
I just think that it's,
if I was me I would be going crazy.

1894
01:44:27,051 --> 01:44:29,270
I mean it would just keep me up at night.
I would be like,

1895
01:44:29,660 --> 01:44:34,660
how is it that someone could
not understand that this
is so complex that this

1896
01:44:35,751 --> 01:44:40,040
is, this is not just one
issue of a law being broken.

1897
01:44:40,370 --> 01:44:45,370
This is not one issue of an underground
marketplace of nefarious people doing

1898
01:44:45,831 --> 01:44:47,090
dastardly deeds.

1899
01:44:47,330 --> 01:44:52,220
This is an aspect of
human cultural evolution.

1900
01:44:52,430 --> 01:44:56,900
Yeah, it is. It's a little frustrating,
but I, you know, I also, like I said,

1901
01:44:56,901 --> 01:44:58,310
a lot of the people that I interview

1902
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:04,010
are more sensible than sometimes what
the prevailing narrative is. You know,

1903
01:45:04,190 --> 01:45:06,920
you do encounter people that are
just really have their, their,

1904
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:10,910
their heads planted in the sand that
just don't want to think about things

1905
01:45:10,911 --> 01:45:12,290
differently than the
way they perceive them.

1906
01:45:12,290 --> 01:45:15,770
I actually encountered that a lot with
the Napster story or people who are just

1907
01:45:15,830 --> 01:45:18,800
adamantly, no, it was only about stealing.

1908
01:45:18,801 --> 01:45:21,620
No is not about something other
than piracy and they just could not,

1909
01:45:21,830 --> 01:45:25,600
could not see it. And I think that
we're still there with the Napster,

1910
01:45:25,601 --> 01:45:28,220
which I think people still just cannot
get their heads around what actually

1911
01:45:28,221 --> 01:45:31,310
happened. But you know,
I still think it's,

1912
01:45:31,311 --> 01:45:34,820
there's value in just telling the stories
and shining a light on them and trying

1913
01:45:34,821 --> 01:45:37,060
to provide some nuance.
And you know,

1914
01:45:37,070 --> 01:45:39,740
when I tour around with the festivals
and we have these great Q and A's and

1915
01:45:39,741 --> 01:45:43,000
people are really, they either know more
about it than I do or they know less,

1916
01:45:43,001 --> 01:45:45,680
or there's somewhere in the
middle and conversation start.

1917
01:45:46,070 --> 01:45:49,310
And I think that's really, that's
helpful on some level. Well,

1918
01:45:49,311 --> 01:45:51,350
it's a generational issue as well.
I mean,

1919
01:45:51,351 --> 01:45:54,230
if you're talking to people that are in
their 50s they're going to be less than

1920
01:45:54,231 --> 01:45:56,210
two and then people in their
forties who are less than two,

1921
01:45:56,330 --> 01:45:58,310
unless they're like really
actively pursuing it,

1922
01:45:58,640 --> 01:46:02,090
but the kids in our twenties
they're almost all in tuned to,

1923
01:46:02,100 --> 01:46:05,330
at least the ones that are smart
aren't obsessed with Justin Bieber.

1924
01:46:05,980 --> 01:46:08,680
They're tuned in to what's going on here.
Yeah.

1925
01:46:08,810 --> 01:46:13,810
They literally are a part of a generation
that will go down as being the first

1926
01:46:14,481 --> 01:46:17,780
generation that grew up entirely
with the Internet. Yeah.

1927
01:46:17,781 --> 01:46:19,820
And these are people who are
utilizing these technologies.

1928
01:46:19,821 --> 01:46:23,000
It's such a fundamental level that they
don't think that that's the whole thing

1929
01:46:23,001 --> 01:46:24,070
with the Napster thing and I,

1930
01:46:24,110 --> 01:46:26,510
and it certainly works in the
Silk Road case to some degree,

1931
01:46:26,870 --> 01:46:29,300
is these people did not view
themselves as criminals. That was the,

1932
01:46:29,330 --> 01:46:31,280
that was the pushback.
And it happened to me.

1933
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:34,690
I was using Napster and suddenly we were
all being branded as pirates and I kind

1934
01:46:34,691 --> 01:46:37,730
of was like, wait a minute, I know
I'm not a pirate. So I was like,

1935
01:46:37,731 --> 01:46:40,130
I know I'm not a criminal.
Legally you were right. Exactly.

1936
01:46:40,131 --> 01:46:43,640
But I'm being branded as one and I did
not respond well to that. I thought, Whoa,

1937
01:46:43,641 --> 01:46:46,520
well, you know like don't,
don't leap to calling me that.

1938
01:46:46,521 --> 01:46:50,820
And then your branding an entire
generation, like your new consumers,

1939
01:46:50,850 --> 01:46:52,230
you're branding them as criminals.

1940
01:46:52,231 --> 01:46:55,530
Like how is that going to help you
or your cause in the end? Well,

1941
01:46:55,531 --> 01:46:58,500
that was the Lars Earl rich thing
where it was everybody. I mean,

1942
01:46:58,501 --> 01:47:01,980
it really was really because he was
a really wealthy guy and the head of,

1943
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:03,120
he stuck his neck out.
I mean,

1944
01:47:03,121 --> 01:47:06,780
the thing about Lars and actually have
sympathy for Lars, I feel like with Lars,

1945
01:47:07,530 --> 01:47:12,480
what happened with large as he was
like, you know, he had his song, um,

1946
01:47:12,510 --> 01:47:15,960
you know, put out on Napster before
they'd finished it. It was, I disappear.

1947
01:47:16,230 --> 01:47:19,110
And then it was, it got put on k rock.
So he's like an artist and he's like,

1948
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:23,970
Oh God, this version with the crappy
drum track is on fucking k rock. Oh Man.

1949
01:47:23,971 --> 01:47:25,620
His head exploded. Right. And that's,

1950
01:47:25,830 --> 01:47:29,970
that was his reaction was like the
pure artists, like holy shit reaction,

1951
01:47:29,971 --> 01:47:32,580
which I as an artist, I get
that. And then he was like,

1952
01:47:32,581 --> 01:47:34,410
we got to lead a charge
against these guys.

1953
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:39,090
And he ran out and he looked back
and nobody else was at his back.

1954
01:47:39,420 --> 01:47:41,610
Nobody like all the other
artists were like, yeah,

1955
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:46,530
none of them had the balls to give
him some credit to come out and say,

1956
01:47:46,531 --> 01:47:48,930
wait a minute, we need to have
better discussions about this.

1957
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:52,680
So they totally stuck his ass out
in the forefront and then they ran.

1958
01:47:53,010 --> 01:47:56,360
Well the fans felt like you greedy.
Fuck right.

1959
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:59,760
Like you're a multimillionaire and you're
complaining that you're going to lose

1960
01:47:59,761 --> 01:48:04,680
some money off of this. Right. And they
just felt betrayed. Yeah, I think they,

1961
01:48:04,920 --> 01:48:08,430
I think they did and I felt for him to
the degree that as an artist I felt like

1962
01:48:08,431 --> 01:48:12,120
his reaction, whatever you want to say
about the politics of it, his initial gut,

1963
01:48:12,121 --> 01:48:14,850
oh my God, reaction is would have
been my, you know what I mean?

1964
01:48:14,851 --> 01:48:17,510
When you make something and it's in
rough cut form or it's not, you know,

1965
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:20,690
the idea that like that's out there. Like
someone stuck in a movie theater. Okay.

1966
01:48:20,700 --> 01:48:23,820
Rock and make sure that's like you lose
sleep on that kind of stuff at night.

1967
01:48:23,850 --> 01:48:25,890
Yeah.
Comics have this with Youtube,

1968
01:48:25,891 --> 01:48:30,060
with bits like you're working on a new
bit and someone shows up at a comedy club

1969
01:48:30,300 --> 01:48:34,620
and records you when you're on stage and
then releases it on youtube and then it

1970
01:48:34,621 --> 01:48:37,800
gets downloaded by 100,000 people.
Like that bit's sucks. It's not,

1971
01:48:37,950 --> 01:48:41,790
that bit's a baby. You know, you
can't, it's not done yet. Yeah. When I,

1972
01:48:41,850 --> 01:48:45,660
when I'm done, I'll put it on a fucking
DVD. I'll put it on a comedy special.

1973
01:48:45,710 --> 01:48:48,960
Right. And the, the truth though
is as I think you've been saying,

1974
01:48:48,961 --> 01:48:51,450
is that it isn't to brand them.
It's like you have,

1975
01:48:51,750 --> 01:48:54,180
it's incumbent upon us to
change the way we do business.

1976
01:48:54,450 --> 01:48:57,840
Like we can't say you can't, we can't
just wag our finger at them and say,

1977
01:48:57,841 --> 01:49:00,030
you stop doing that. Of course
they're going to do it. Right.

1978
01:49:00,120 --> 01:49:02,430
It's this amazing new technology
that that's, you know,

1979
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:06,870
communal and fast and democratized and
they're not going to stop doing it.

1980
01:49:06,871 --> 01:49:09,360
We have to change. Yeah. It's,

1981
01:49:09,750 --> 01:49:14,750
it's going to be very weird when
it hits whatever the next stage is,

1982
01:49:16,020 --> 01:49:17,630
whatever the next stage
is. Cause I'm, I'm,

1983
01:49:17,631 --> 01:49:21,540
I'm imagining with very little
technological expertise of course.

1984
01:49:21,570 --> 01:49:25,290
Well how about zero? Half of none.
I've just, I'm a user. Come on.

1985
01:49:25,291 --> 01:49:27,550
You had a website in [inaudible]
98 with a message board. That's,

1986
01:49:27,580 --> 01:49:31,030
that's way farther along than most people.
I hired somebody, I don't even know.

1987
01:49:31,150 --> 01:49:35,580
Still you had the cheese? Yeah.
You had the foresight to do it.

1988
01:49:35,610 --> 01:49:40,390
That's still different. Well maybe.
Okay. But my point being you,

1989
01:49:40,470 --> 01:49:44,100
if you try to imagine what
the next stage is going to be,

1990
01:49:44,101 --> 01:49:47,980
I would imagine that it would be
something virtual and I'm, I'm

1991
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:52,420
imagining that what we're looking at
now when you're looking at a website,

1992
01:49:52,421 --> 01:49:55,390
even when you're looking at message
boards and you're looking at Twitter,

1993
01:49:55,391 --> 01:49:58,240
Facebook,
social media is akin to those,

1994
01:49:58,930 --> 01:50:03,930
those boards that existed back in the
day before there was any like real,

1995
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:09,460
like there was a wet, yeah, we're
talking about 93 yeah. Before the,

1996
01:50:09,700 --> 01:50:10,660
what would those things called?

1997
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:14,380
Like beat bulletin boards that
you use net and the bbs era. Yeah.

1998
01:50:14,381 --> 01:50:15,370
You'd have to log on.

1999
01:50:15,371 --> 01:50:18,700
It would take you an hour and he'd go
there and check to see if anybody left

2000
01:50:18,701 --> 01:50:21,580
anything there and then you'd
have to screw off for a while.

2001
01:50:21,581 --> 01:50:25,510
And those are looked at as a joke
now when you can get, you know,

2002
01:50:25,810 --> 01:50:30,370
New York Times will give you a instant
messages on your phone and let you know

2003
01:50:30,371 --> 01:50:32,770
when there's alerts when
anything's happening. Yeah.

2004
01:50:32,830 --> 01:50:36,110
You check Twitter anytime anything's
going down. Like anytime someone dies or,

2005
01:50:36,111 --> 01:50:39,280
and I find out about it on Twitter
before I ever see it on the news.

2006
01:50:39,281 --> 01:50:44,050
It seems like it's almost instantaneous,
but even more so than that,

2007
01:50:44,051 --> 01:50:48,520
things like youtube, youtube is very
two dimensional. We look at it, it's,

2008
01:50:48,521 --> 01:50:52,270
it's awesome. You could watch
stuff on it, you know, or you know,

2009
01:50:52,390 --> 01:50:54,940
a even HBO go.

2010
01:50:55,390 --> 01:50:59,440
Any of these things where you're seeing
things online, it's very two dimensional.

2011
01:50:59,770 --> 01:51:02,390
I think virtual is going
to be the next step.

2012
01:51:02,710 --> 01:51:07,710
Oculus rift type technology and the
way that's progressing right now is,

2013
01:51:08,750 --> 01:51:13,690
is kind of frightening. It's really
getting unbelievably realistic. It is.

2014
01:51:13,691 --> 01:51:17,590
Yeah. Yeah. It's getting super advanced
and the fluidity, the ability to use it,

2015
01:51:17,591 --> 01:51:20,380
like how that stuff can get
projected and how that's going to,

2016
01:51:20,381 --> 01:51:23,890
I mean things are gonna change across
the board in a lot of ways and like

2017
01:51:23,891 --> 01:51:27,210
driverless cars, certain things that
are going to cause huge changes are,

2018
01:51:27,290 --> 01:51:29,860
are literally around the corner.
I mean that's, we're just only,

2019
01:51:29,861 --> 01:51:34,280
we're years away from driverless cars,
not like decades away from driverless car.

2020
01:51:34,660 --> 01:51:38,720
It's a very exciting time,
but it's also a very woo Jesus don't know,

2021
01:51:38,721 --> 01:51:41,110
challenging time. I mean that's
the reason I make these stories.

2022
01:51:41,111 --> 01:51:43,360
It's not because I think, oh,
this is so awesome. You know?

2023
01:51:43,361 --> 01:51:46,930
I just want to like pick up my camera and
shoot all this awesome stuff. You know?

2024
01:51:46,931 --> 01:51:48,910
It is challenging.
It's challenging morally,

2025
01:51:48,911 --> 01:51:51,550
ethically it's challenging on
all of these levels. It is.

2026
01:51:51,940 --> 01:51:55,120
That's part of why I think we need to
be having conversations about this stuff

2027
01:51:55,121 --> 01:51:59,110
that they were more sane.
Yeah. I couldn't agree more.

2028
01:51:59,290 --> 01:52:04,150
I also think that as as a a giant
super organism, the human race,

2029
01:52:04,540 --> 01:52:08,860
which w w what we really are really
think about it were some sort of a giant

2030
01:52:08,861 --> 01:52:09,940
super organism.

2031
01:52:10,110 --> 01:52:14,680
The organism that works together to
create these things and fund these things

2032
01:52:14,681 --> 01:52:18,970
and push things forward.
We were kind of just moving along,

2033
01:52:19,720 --> 01:52:22,750
not considering the implications
of what we're doing,

2034
01:52:22,751 --> 01:52:26,500
but just continuing along the same path.
Like if you can't,

2035
01:52:26,530 --> 01:52:30,850
if you step back and say, you know what
is virtual reality is just too fucked up,

2036
01:52:30,851 --> 01:52:33,130
we should really stop and
consider it. Well, guess what?

2037
01:52:33,131 --> 01:52:36,400
Sony's going to come along and they're
going to just take the fucking rug out

2038
01:52:36,401 --> 01:52:38,920
from under you and they're going to
have a better thing that you're making

2039
01:52:38,921 --> 01:52:41,620
Spiderman reboots forever
on your virtual reality.

2040
01:52:42,580 --> 01:52:44,980
You'll never be able to
stop them. Well, porn,

2041
01:52:45,020 --> 01:52:48,140
which is at the forefront of all
technology, that that pushes,

2042
01:52:48,290 --> 01:52:52,730
that pushed html five or flash and
paypal everything. Yeah, yeah. Well,

2043
01:52:53,030 --> 01:52:56,690
what they're going to do with that
virtual reality stuff is going to be very,

2044
01:52:56,691 --> 01:52:59,980
very, very bizarre right now. And
you're going to have what you've seen,

2045
01:52:59,981 --> 01:53:02,260
you have a problem with people being
addicted to porn now. I mean, yeah.

2046
01:53:02,330 --> 01:53:05,000
No one was addicted to
literature porn. Right. You know,

2047
01:53:05,001 --> 01:53:10,001
back when they look at my
vera type on my stereo graph,

2048
01:53:10,730 --> 01:53:14,060
when they had those books that
people are write by hand. Yeah.

2049
01:53:14,150 --> 01:53:17,570
Nobody was addicted to beating
off to those things. I mean, God,

2050
01:53:17,571 --> 01:53:21,820
how many of them even were
there. Yeah. And then the
printing press came along. Oh,

2051
01:53:21,830 --> 01:53:25,400
maybe things a little bit
more interesting. Yeah. And
then magazines came along.

2052
01:53:25,401 --> 01:53:29,210
Whoa. Girly magazines that used to
have to get stuck under your bed. Yeah.

2053
01:53:29,211 --> 01:53:32,630
He used to hide them and shit and
squirrel them away. Like nuts. I know.

2054
01:53:32,660 --> 01:53:35,150
And then it became VHS tapes.
Whoa.

2055
01:53:35,151 --> 01:53:39,410
And then DVDs Wa and then
online. Oh. And then it became,

2056
01:53:39,411 --> 01:53:42,860
you could get it on your phone
when I phones came along. Yeah.

2057
01:53:42,980 --> 01:53:46,490
The screen's got bigger. It was very nice
of them. Yeah. It's going to get very,

2058
01:53:46,491 --> 01:53:47,480
very strange.
Yeah.

2059
01:53:47,870 --> 01:53:51,560
There's going to come some sort of a
neural interface inside of our lifetime

2060
01:53:51,561 --> 01:53:56,300
where you're going to be able to enter
into worlds that have been created that

2061
01:53:56,301 --> 01:53:59,360
seem indistinguishable from the world
that we're currently in. Right? Yeah.

2062
01:53:59,361 --> 01:54:01,520
There's no doubt. There's no
doubt that, I mean that's I,

2063
01:54:01,560 --> 01:54:04,610
that's within our lifetime
and when that does happen,

2064
01:54:05,210 --> 01:54:08,990
they look back on things like the Silk
Road was controversies can seem so

2065
01:54:08,991 --> 01:54:11,540
preposterous. So primitive. Yeah.
I mean I think that the idea,

2066
01:54:11,541 --> 01:54:13,640
I think online drug markets
are going to be ubiquitous.

2067
01:54:13,641 --> 01:54:17,600
They and they may very likely be the
thing that takes major cartels down in the

2068
01:54:17,601 --> 01:54:19,010
long run.
Well,

2069
01:54:19,070 --> 01:54:23,780
I was listening to this radio lab
podcast where they were talking about the

2070
01:54:23,781 --> 01:54:24,890
placebo effect.

2071
01:54:25,220 --> 01:54:28,760
I think that might be the name of
the podcast for anyone is interested.

2072
01:54:28,760 --> 01:54:32,690
I think it's just called placebo.
But they were talking about the,

2073
01:54:32,691 --> 01:54:36,350
the various times where placebo
effect has worked and has not worked.

2074
01:54:36,351 --> 01:54:40,040
And one of the things that they said that
was so incredible is that like you're

2075
01:54:40,470 --> 01:54:42,740
the reason why drugs work,

2076
01:54:43,370 --> 01:54:48,370
that every drug that works on the human
mind works because there is a receptor,

2077
01:54:50,180 --> 01:54:53,000
there's a biological
receptor in the brain,

2078
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:57,080
so essentially the brain
produces all of these effects,

2079
01:54:57,320 --> 01:55:01,640
just not reliably. Opioid
effects, opiate effects,

2080
01:55:02,060 --> 01:55:04,700
cannabis affects all
these different drugs.

2081
01:55:04,910 --> 01:55:08,850
We know the brain produces various
chemicals, dopamine, Serotonin,

2082
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:12,620
psychedelic chemicals.
Your brain produces all of these things.

2083
01:55:12,890 --> 01:55:17,000
If they can figure out how to
do with no drugs, something,

2084
01:55:17,030 --> 01:55:18,790
some virtual things,
something,

2085
01:55:18,810 --> 01:55:23,810
some chip that just stimulates those
aspects of your brain and produces those

2086
01:55:23,841 --> 01:55:28,400
feelings of euphoria, love, hate, loss,

2087
01:55:28,550 --> 01:55:32,480
sadness,
and does so inside of a virtual world.

2088
01:55:32,690 --> 01:55:37,690
I mean they're going to take you on a
real live drug ride and no drugs would be

2089
01:55:38,481 --> 01:55:40,070
involved.
You mean then?

2090
01:55:40,100 --> 01:55:43,530
Then what do you do with your drug war
when all the drugs are produced by the

2091
01:55:43,531 --> 01:55:48,390
mind, you're going to stop people from
producing and dodginess chemicals that the

2092
01:55:48,391 --> 01:55:51,270
brain naturally produces me.
You're already doing that with movies.

2093
01:55:51,570 --> 01:55:54,980
What do you think the adrenaline effect
you get from a crazy thriller is, right?

2094
01:55:55,040 --> 01:55:59,100
Why are people into horror movies? It's
not because they have no effect on you.

2095
01:55:59,220 --> 01:56:02,610
They're producing drugs. When you
watched Jason, he's coming up behind,

2096
01:56:02,611 --> 01:56:07,110
somebody got the fucking
machete. Oh, you're scared.
You're scared of those movies.

2097
01:56:07,260 --> 01:56:09,990
That's a drug.
They're giving you drugs.

2098
01:56:10,380 --> 01:56:14,780
It's just they're making you
produce it with your own mind. Yeah.

2099
01:56:14,820 --> 01:56:17,400
It's going to happen in a
very bizarre way. It is.

2100
01:56:17,401 --> 01:56:20,070
I think that is going to have an
impact. And I think that, you know,

2101
01:56:20,160 --> 01:56:23,430
the other issue that I think is
important is just like, you know,

2102
01:56:23,431 --> 01:56:25,170
for those people that do need help there,

2103
01:56:25,171 --> 01:56:28,470
that needs to be decriminalized
to a degree where they
can actually get the help

2104
01:56:28,471 --> 01:56:31,650
in a way that isn't stigmatized or they're
not just felonies ISED immediately.

2105
01:56:31,651 --> 01:56:36,300
So that's an issue as well at any
needs to get addressed. Oh, 100%.

2106
01:56:36,301 --> 01:56:39,450
And also the reason why people
get addicted in the first place.

2107
01:56:39,451 --> 01:56:44,280
Just the trauma that people experience
as young children that causes these

2108
01:56:44,281 --> 01:56:48,570
receptors to open up these
causes, these drug addiction, um,

2109
01:56:49,080 --> 01:56:51,180
processes to take place.

2110
01:56:51,630 --> 01:56:56,630
And you talk to people that have counseled
folks that have massive drug problems

2111
01:56:56,971 --> 01:56:58,590
and then understand where,

2112
01:56:58,620 --> 01:57:03,090
how these genes get addressed
and it's all very, very complex.

2113
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:05,820
And who gets addicted and
who doesn't get addicted.

2114
01:57:06,090 --> 01:57:10,050
A lot of that has to do with your
response to childhood trauma.

2115
01:57:10,500 --> 01:57:14,010
That's hard for people to relate to.
That's hard for people to understand.

2116
01:57:14,011 --> 01:57:17,370
Genetics and the genetic disease component
and like there's no way to have a

2117
01:57:17,371 --> 01:57:20,850
really thorough conversation about
this stuff if it's just criminalized.

2118
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:23,550
You can't just drag net it.
Yeah. Lock 'em up. Yeah.

2119
01:57:24,510 --> 01:57:26,580
Black on Deno you can't do that.

2120
01:57:26,581 --> 01:57:31,230
It's just like we have this simplistic
view of the world and that view is being

2121
01:57:31,231 --> 01:57:35,190
challenged constantly by fax.
Yeah. Constantly by data.

2122
01:57:35,430 --> 01:57:39,060
And there's some people that, like you
said, want to bury their head in the sand.

2123
01:57:39,090 --> 01:57:40,110
They don't want to look at it.

2124
01:57:40,620 --> 01:57:43,350
They don't want to because it
doesn't fit the narrative. Yeah.

2125
01:57:43,351 --> 01:57:45,390
And that's getting harder and
harder to do in any corner.

2126
01:57:45,391 --> 01:57:48,690
Even like geopolitics of the world
was at our doorstep every day now.

2127
01:57:48,691 --> 01:57:51,540
And whether you like it or not,
is that right there in front of you?

2128
01:57:51,540 --> 01:57:56,400
So it also seems like people are doing
that because it's easier to live that way

2129
01:57:56,670 --> 01:58:00,480
because you can't know
everything about everything.

2130
01:58:00,660 --> 01:58:03,540
There's too much going on right now.
I totally agree with that,

2131
01:58:03,541 --> 01:58:05,980
that people are just like, look, I've
got to take this course cause what?

2132
01:58:06,020 --> 01:58:07,230
What are you asking me to do?

2133
01:58:07,231 --> 01:58:09,990
You're asking me to veer off and
really do I really want to know about

2134
01:58:09,991 --> 01:58:13,200
cryptography? Do I really want to know
about how this stuff works? You know,

2135
01:58:13,201 --> 01:58:14,490
it's like you don't have to,

2136
01:58:14,491 --> 01:58:18,080
provided you're not taking a counter
narrative that's causing harm somewhere

2137
01:58:18,300 --> 01:58:21,510
down the line. Yeah. You don't
have to, you really don't have.

2138
01:58:21,511 --> 01:58:24,180
But the counter narrative is really
assure the people that are burying their

2139
01:58:24,181 --> 01:58:28,350
head in the sand and trying to
shove your face in as well. Exactly.

2140
01:58:28,410 --> 01:58:31,800
That's really what it is, right? Yeah.
Yeah. That's the problem. Well, Alex,

2141
01:58:31,801 --> 01:58:32,980
thank you very much.
Thanks.

2142
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:36,060
Barely really appreciated this
conversation and I really appreciate your

2143
01:58:36,061 --> 01:58:40,890
documentary. Deep Web. It's on Epix on
May 31st will it eventually be available?

2144
01:58:41,060 --> 01:58:44,590
Itunes, Amazon, Netflix, everything like
that after it, after it's on Netflix,

2145
01:58:44,650 --> 01:58:47,470
on epics for a little while to
be available everywhere. And uh,

2146
01:58:47,471 --> 01:58:50,530
Alex is available on Twitter.
You can follow him.

2147
01:58:50,531 --> 01:58:55,330
It's a l x winter on Twitter.
And is there anything else you want?

2148
01:58:55,690 --> 01:58:59,950
That's it, man. Yeah, it's deep web,
the movie and I'm a.com but you know,

2149
01:58:59,951 --> 01:59:01,030
you can sign up for a newsletter.

2150
01:59:01,031 --> 01:59:04,540
I sort of send out information and Cole
ancillary stuff, but thank you so much,

2151
01:59:04,541 --> 01:59:07,140
man. Thanks for making this too.
Really, really appreciate. Thank you.

2152
01:59:07,150 --> 01:59:09,490
Appreciate the conversation.
Yeah. All right, my friends.

2153
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:12,910
We'll be back on Wednesday with
Abby Martin and Jim Norton.

2154
01:59:12,940 --> 01:59:15,700
Until then go fuck yourself.
Okay. Bye. Bye. Big Kiss.

2155
01:59:28,150 --> 01:59:28,230
Okay.
