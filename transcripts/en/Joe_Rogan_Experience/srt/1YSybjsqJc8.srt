1
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:04,920
Five,
four,

2
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:06,120
three,
two,

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,013
one.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,920
And we're live with Justin Brown.
Justin,

5
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:12,600
first of all,
I'm very upset that gave you such a

6
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:14,730
small badge.
What's up with that?

7
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:15,960
Yeah.
And it's nice and tiny.

8
00:00:15,961 --> 00:00:18,690
They're not law enforcement.
So seems like you should have like,

9
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:21,110
like you've,
there's some badge there.

10
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,590
The summit forcement,
right?

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Sure.
It looks like it doesn't it?

12
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:25,920
But yeah.
No law enforcement on my end.

13
00:00:25,921 --> 00:00:27,690
And just the biologist.
Well,

14
00:00:27,691 --> 00:00:28,480
listen man,
I've,

15
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,120
I read about your work in um,
uh,

16
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,270
an online article.
I don't remember where it was,

17
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,160
but about coyotes in the urban area all
around Los Angeles and I've been

18
00:00:38,161 --> 00:00:41,910
fascinated by this since I moved to La.
The first time I saw a coyote was in

19
00:00:41,911 --> 00:00:46,090
1994 when I first moved here.
I was in Burbank and uh,

20
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:47,970
I had an apartment and you know,
one of those,

21
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,810
um,
those uh,

22
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,460
pre furnished Oakwood's gardens
apartment on all of the street,

23
00:00:53,461 --> 00:00:55,530
you know,
where that is not the top of my head,

24
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,340
but it's where people always,
when they transitioned to La,

25
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,080
they get one of these pre furnished
apartments.

26
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,920
He.
Anyway,

27
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,640
yeah.
I'm driving up olive and I saw these

28
00:01:05,641 --> 00:01:09,060
coyotes and is the first time I'd ever
seen a coyote and I was like,

29
00:01:09,061 --> 00:01:11,580
this is crazy,
like this is in Burbank,

30
00:01:11,581 --> 00:01:15,960
this is in a residential area,
and they were just hanging out and I

31
00:01:15,961 --> 00:01:18,990
pulled over and I stopped and I rolled
down the window and I,

32
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:20,610
oh,
staring at them and they're staring at

33
00:01:20,611 --> 00:01:25,611
me and they didn't give a shit about me.
They were so calm and they didn't run

34
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,760
and I just remember thinking this is so
strange.

35
00:01:28,761 --> 00:01:32,850
He's like wild dogs that live like right
amongst us.

36
00:01:32,851 --> 00:01:35,580
And then from then on I've had some
encounters.

37
00:01:35,581 --> 00:01:37,980
I had a coyote steal a chicken for my
yard.

38
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:42,090
I watched him hop the fence with the
chicken in his mouth if quite a few

39
00:01:42,091 --> 00:01:43,460
encounters with coyotes,
but I'm,

40
00:01:43,461 --> 00:01:45,210
I'm absolutely fascinated by them.

41
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,710
I mean,
they've been amazing.

42
00:01:46,711 --> 00:01:49,020
I've been working with them now for
almost 15 years,

43
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,250
actually a little bit more than that
now.

44
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,530
And I've seen him do some amazing
things.

45
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:53,940
I mean,
they're able to live in some of the most

46
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,650
urban environments we can imagine.
I mean,

47
00:01:55,651 --> 00:01:58,290
I'm tracking them right next to,
I don't know if you know where the West

48
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,110
Lake neighborhood is in downtown la,
but if a coyote running that

49
00:02:01,111 --> 00:02:03,180
neighborhood,
which when I first drove through there,

50
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:06,060
so I worked in Chicago for a long time.
We were tracking coyotes and some

51
00:02:06,061 --> 00:02:07,530
incredibly urban areas.
They're like,

52
00:02:07,531 --> 00:02:10,320
right along the lake shore drive in
Chicago and,

53
00:02:10,321 --> 00:02:13,320
but in Chicago there's some green spots
where when you get down in La,

54
00:02:13,321 --> 00:02:16,530
there's not a lot of open spots,
vacant lots and stuff.

55
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,230
Um,
but I tracked this coyote for about nine

56
00:02:19,231 --> 00:02:21,720
months down there in that area and she
was just amazing.

57
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,810
Like she was running the streets.
She kinda hang out in these little

58
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,150
vacant lots.
And what was even more amazing is that

59
00:02:27,151 --> 00:02:29,760
no one was really complaining about her.
We actually talked to people and some of

60
00:02:29,761 --> 00:02:33,680
the houses and stuff they were actually
fascinated to see on versus being like

61
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,610
they're in my backyard where they do it.
Well.

62
00:02:35,611 --> 00:02:37,830
People have always had a weird
relationship with coyotes.

63
00:02:37,831 --> 00:02:38,550
I had,
um,

64
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:42,480
Dan Flores on the podcast last month
who's the author of Coyote America.

65
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,320
And uh,
he's a,

66
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,130
uh,
wildlife historian and it has just some

67
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:51,510
amazing insight until like the
relationship to cody's had way back with

68
00:02:51,511 --> 00:02:52,710
the native Americans,
you know,

69
00:02:52,711 --> 00:02:54,990
they thought they were gods and a lot of
ways.

70
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,600
Yeah.
I actually listen to your podcast with

71
00:02:57,601 --> 00:02:58,434
Dan.
That was great.

72
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,600
Dan's some pretty interesting facts just
in his book in general,

73
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:03,370
things I didn't actually know about
before.

74
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,730
It's kind of Nice to have a historian
tie in some of the facts I could get

75
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:08,620
lost,
ask lots of questions about where the

76
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:10,600
coyotes came from,
how they're moving around.

77
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,360
Um,
and so it's nice to have something like

78
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:15,100
Dan's book to kind of reference people
to.

79
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:19,400
I think most people in the downtown La
probably welcomed something like caio

80
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,790
because it's kind of cool,
you know,

81
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,340
and have this thing I can't get around
as long as you don't have a dog or a cat

82
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:25,750
that it's snatches.
Yeah.

83
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:27,700
And that's definitely the case.
A lot of people think it's cool,

84
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:29,380
but they do cause problems.
Um,

85
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:32,920
I'm actually dealing with one in Silver
Lake neighborhood that keeps going up to

86
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:36,520
people walking their dogs and trying to.
It's got a den in somebody's backyard is

87
00:03:36,521 --> 00:03:40,990
actually deneen under their deck.
So the decks open and she put our seven

88
00:03:40,991 --> 00:03:42,280
pups underneath this den.

89
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,290
Yeah.
So it's pretty crazy.

90
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,390
Um,
but she would basically,

91
00:03:46,391 --> 00:03:49,420
but he gets closed with a dog.
She comes out and tries to run them off.

92
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,820
And this is pretty common during pupping
season.

93
00:03:51,821 --> 00:03:55,150
This is the time when most people have
issues with coyotes because they're

94
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,820
trying to protect their dens.
I mean we're all obviously protective of

95
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:01,360
our offspring,
so they think that the dog is going to

96
00:04:01,361 --> 00:04:03,010
find the pups and kill them or
something.

97
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,200
Uh,
I mean we don't really know why they're

98
00:04:05,201 --> 00:04:06,850
doing it.
We assume that's probably the case.

99
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:09,340
They come up and they,
most of the attacks have been where they

100
00:04:09,341 --> 00:04:11,470
just come up behind the dog and start
trying to like nip it.

101
00:04:11,471 --> 00:04:14,140
It's back and the dog,
the people move on,

102
00:04:14,141 --> 00:04:15,830
people freak out.
Um,

103
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,760
as far as I know,
there hasn't been anywhere that I would

104
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:20,230
actually like draw blood on the dog,
so it's almost more like,

105
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:21,250
it's like get the hell Outta here.

106
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,750
Right.
So they're just scaring them.

107
00:04:22,751 --> 00:04:25,630
They're not trying.
They're not actually being predators.

108
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,250
That's what it seems like for the most
part.

109
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:29,110
I mean they definitely do kill a little
dogs.

110
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,720
Many occasionally end up fighting with
big dogs as well,

111
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:33,790
but that's rare.
Wow.

112
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,680
So these,
what are they eating?

113
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,960
Like especially the one in downtown?
Yeah.

114
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:39,370
So that's,
that's interesting.

115
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,170
Um,
we've actually been doing this study

116
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:42,580
using,
working with a bunch of citizen

117
00:04:42,581 --> 00:04:44,770
scientists and I don't know if that's
the story you read or not,

118
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,130
but we're basically having people
collect coyote scat from around downtown

119
00:04:48,131 --> 00:04:51,520
La and they were actually breaking.
The coyotes got up to look what's in it

120
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,590
and we're seeing a huge variety of
things.

121
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:55,480
I mean,
lots of fruits and stuff.

122
00:04:55,481 --> 00:04:57,220
They were actually big time into
vegetation,

123
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,500
vegetation type stuff,
a lot of fruits and an urban

124
00:04:59,501 --> 00:05:01,990
environment.
Obviously we got peaches and plums and

125
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,780
all kinds of crazy fruity and stuff that
they take advantage of,

126
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,360
but they're also eating rats and
squirrels,

127
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,370
cats,
um,

128
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,050
insects.

129
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:16,050
We see things like earwigs and those big
old potato bugs we'll see eating almost

130
00:05:16,631 --> 00:05:19,690
anything you can think of.
They're taking advantage of human trash.

131
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:20,670
Well,
I,

132
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:24,550
I've had him in my yard for a long time
and one of the things that surprised me

133
00:05:24,551 --> 00:05:26,920
is how much coyote scad that I find with
berries in it,

134
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,170
like I didn't know that there were
omnivores.

135
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,620
They really are omnivores then.
It's not like a,

136
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,490
like a dog or a cat.
I mean they pretty much everything.

137
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,170
Yeah.
I mean coyotes can take advantage and

138
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,580
that's why they're able to live amongst
us.

139
00:05:39,581 --> 00:05:41,050
I mean,
because even when there's not a lot of

140
00:05:41,051 --> 00:05:42,150
prey available,
they did,

141
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,810
they,
they're able to take advantage of these

142
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:45,790
different fruiting trees.
Yeah.

143
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,440
You know,
I was talking with a friend about it and

144
00:05:47,441 --> 00:05:51,190
he was saying that he hates them and he
wants to kill them all and all this

145
00:05:51,191 --> 00:05:51,400
stuff.

146
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,240
And I was saying,
but yeah,

147
00:05:52,241 --> 00:05:54,880
but ever noticed that you don't see any
rats,

148
00:05:55,630 --> 00:06:00,050
like we hardly have any rats,
like it's so rare that you see a rat or

149
00:06:00,051 --> 00:06:03,350
a mouse in my area.
And I think a big part of that is

150
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:05,990
because you hear coyotes all the time
and I think they're eating them all.

151
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,490
I mean they definitely take advantage of
it.

152
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,890
Maybe there's other predators to.
I'm not sure where you live exactly.

153
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,030
The owls and hawks and stuff,
cats and all those different things.

154
00:06:14,031 --> 00:06:15,800
Definitely have of those praise.
Well,

155
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,731
but yeah,
coyotes,

156
00:06:16,731 --> 00:06:20,680
I mean they're amazing.
They are really are fascinating animals.

157
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:23,450
So this,
this one that got to downtown La,

158
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,820
do you know,
like when it arrived,

159
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,140
I don't know when it arrived.
So I,

160
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,790
I kind of drove through there looking to
see where I might be able to call her a

161
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:35,210
few animals so we could kind of see
what's going on and how these animals

162
00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:37,790
are persisting down there and actually
do that.

163
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,040
Uh,
how do I see of where they're possessed

164
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,211
them?
Oh,

165
00:06:41,211 --> 00:06:42,021
how do I call her?
Um,

166
00:06:42,021 --> 00:06:45,920
so first we have to capture them.
So we'll put out traps will capture them

167
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:49,430
and then once I get them in a trap,
I'll go out with a poll,

168
00:06:49,431 --> 00:06:52,190
I'll pin them to the ground and then
I'll hold him down.

169
00:06:52,191 --> 00:06:53,080
Jesus,
I'll,

170
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:56,600
I'll put a muzzle on them and hold their
feet together and then we'll throw a

171
00:06:56,601 --> 00:06:59,720
collar on him.
We'll take blood to look for disease.

172
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,640
You don't triangles,
we don't tranquilize them.

173
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,200
Wow,
that's crazy.

174
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,940
Yeah.
They actually go very docile.

175
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:06,890
They're a lot like a dog.
Once you kind of show them that you're

176
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:09,800
the dominant thing,
they kind of just lay over and you start

177
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:11,720
to be careful.
Obviously they can turn and bite you if

178
00:07:11,721 --> 00:07:14,810
you don't muzzle them.
But usually once you get them down that

179
00:07:14,811 --> 00:07:16,760
first time they usually just lay there
until you're done.

180
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,760
No kidding.
And it usually takes me somewhere 35,

181
00:07:19,761 --> 00:07:23,090
40 minutes to do the whole thing and
they just lay there.

182
00:07:23,091 --> 00:07:25,400
They're not fighting me anything to deal
with that.

183
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,590
Uh,
I'm sure I do.

184
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,590
I want to see that.
That's kind of a trip.

185
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,320
I would think that there'd be like a
wild cat.

186
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:37,790
Like I've had a feral cat before and I
had her when she was a kitten or he

187
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,840
rather when he was a kitten and he was
like a spazz,

188
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,330
like you couldn't even hold onto him.
He would freak out and climb the

189
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:48,320
curtains and Hisson sputter at you.
And now it's like a little domestic cat

190
00:07:48,321 --> 00:07:50,210
that was born outside.
Oh yeah.

191
00:07:50,211 --> 00:07:52,250
We do drug.
Any of our cats we catch.

192
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:54,950
So we catch a bobcat's.
It's another study that we're doing a

193
00:07:54,951 --> 00:07:56,000
lot of.
Uh,

194
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:59,270
we've actually had a bobcat project
going on since 1996.

195
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,880
And so we've been calling those guys for
a long time.

196
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,740
They're not docile.
They're not docile.

197
00:08:03,741 --> 00:08:05,930
We don't trust them.
Raccoons are another species.

198
00:08:05,931 --> 00:08:08,090
You don't handle those guys on drugs.
Oh yeah.

199
00:08:08,091 --> 00:08:10,730
I would imagine they'll make you pay the
price and that crazy.

200
00:08:10,731 --> 00:08:13,280
Like people don't realize it.
Raccoons are predators.

201
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,231
Yeah.
Well they're,

202
00:08:14,231 --> 00:08:15,860
they're,
they're definitely omnivores.

203
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,440
Like just like the coyotes are.
They actually had a lot of fruit and

204
00:08:18,441 --> 00:08:19,960
stuff they take,
I mean,

205
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,300
part of them living in an urban
environment is they're just taking

206
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,830
massive advantage of our garbage.
Right.

207
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,210
I couldn't just,
I mean we've,

208
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:30,140
I've seen amazing photos of like 13,
14 raccoons in one garbage can all

209
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,890
feasting down.
I have chickens in my backyard and this

210
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:38,060
one raccoon was by my chicken coop the
other day and I flashed a light on him

211
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,010
and he walked towards the light.

212
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,500
I was like,
look at this cocky bitch.

213
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,260
He just started walking at me and I got
nervous.

214
00:08:45,261 --> 00:08:46,760
I was like,
I don't have a weapon on me or nothing.

215
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:48,020
I thought a flashlight.
He'd be like,

216
00:08:48,021 --> 00:08:48,890
well,
let me get outta here.

217
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,290
He's just looking right at the
flashlight,

218
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:52,870
walking towards me,
you know,

219
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,890
trying to get to the chicken coop.
But you'd be amazed how many people feed

220
00:08:55,891 --> 00:08:58,860
them because they're so dang cute.
Right?

221
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,480
Big Old mask on when people are like,
oh,

222
00:09:00,481 --> 00:09:02,430
they're starving out there.
They can't find their own food,

223
00:09:02,431 --> 00:09:05,160
and so they feel like they need feet on.
And same thing with coyotes to.

224
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:07,830
It's people feel like these animals
can't fend for themselves,

225
00:09:07,831 --> 00:09:11,610
which is ridiculous because they're not
able to make it there because we're

226
00:09:11,611 --> 00:09:13,710
feeding them.
They're making it because there's

227
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:15,480
resources for them to take advantage of.
Yeah,

228
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,450
I would imagine they probably play.

229
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,330
I mean,
like I said,

230
00:09:18,331 --> 00:09:22,270
I think in my neighborhood they do play
an important part of keeping the rodent

231
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:26,100
population down,
but in downtown there's got to be a ton

232
00:09:26,101 --> 00:09:28,290
of rodents as well.
I mean downtown for people that don't

233
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:32,820
know is like the only area in all of La
that really looks like a city.

234
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,321
Yeah,
definitely.

235
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:35,550
I mean I,
like I said,

236
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:37,200
I drove through there.
I mean after track and coyotes in

237
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,420
Chicago,
I didn't think they'd be in some areas

238
00:09:39,421 --> 00:09:41,370
they are in la.
There seemed to be.

239
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:45,900
Everywhere I look I get photos of
coyotes on our cameras or get people

240
00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:48,480
reporting them to us.
And this one that's in downtown,

241
00:09:48,481 --> 00:09:50,700
it's just a single caio by herself?
No,

242
00:09:50,701 --> 00:09:55,170
actually she's got a whole pack so I
call her and then within a couple she

243
00:09:55,171 --> 00:09:56,670
was actually lactating when I caught
her,

244
00:09:56,671 --> 00:10:01,671
so I know she had pups and then we ended
up seeing her with five pops probably a

245
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:08,070
week later and there was actually a,
a ambulance that drove by and she just

246
00:10:08,071 --> 00:10:10,890
started howling and all the pups are out
there yipping and this is all like in

247
00:10:10,891 --> 00:10:12,810
this little vacant lot between two
houses.

248
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,710
Wow.
So they just find these areas where

249
00:10:16,711 --> 00:10:18,030
people aren't.
Yeah.

250
00:10:18,031 --> 00:10:20,370
And so before we call it on,
the one thing I always heard is oh,

251
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:22,950
the coyotes are coming in from griffith
park or they're coming in from Elysian

252
00:10:22,951 --> 00:10:26,460
park and coming into our communities and
they're just here for a night or two

253
00:10:26,461 --> 00:10:29,270
night causing problems and leaving.
Well that's not what we're seeing.

254
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,200
Definitely.
Once we do these colors on these animals

255
00:10:31,201 --> 00:10:32,310
were like,
no,

256
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:35,430
they've got pretty small home ranges.
They're kind of living just in the urban

257
00:10:35,431 --> 00:10:37,680
environment.
They're not going back and forth while

258
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:42,180
living with us.
So do you feel like it's a good thing or

259
00:10:42,181 --> 00:10:44,670
a bad thing to have them around or just
a thing?

260
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:48,060
I think it's just the thing.
I mean it depends on your perspective.

261
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,910
Um,
I think it's bad when people think we

262
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:53,190
need to feed them,
need to do these things,

263
00:10:53,191 --> 00:10:55,830
like to encourage them and make them
more comfortable with us.

264
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:58,320
That's not a good thing because that's
when bites and that kind of stuff

265
00:10:58,321 --> 00:11:01,620
happen.
But when it comes to the coyotes and

266
00:11:01,621 --> 00:11:02,940
stuff,
living in these urban environments,

267
00:11:02,941 --> 00:11:05,520
it's really all about us.
It's more about managing people,

268
00:11:05,521 --> 00:11:07,980
getting people to quit feeding them or
quit.

269
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,990
I mean,
one thing I encourage people to do scare

270
00:11:09,991 --> 00:11:14,460
the stupid coyote off like because
there's lots of people that have little

271
00:11:14,461 --> 00:11:17,940
issues that occur with the coyotes.
They're cats get taken or the coyote

272
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:20,490
start just sitting there watching them.
I had somebody complained recently

273
00:11:20,491 --> 00:11:22,950
because the that was sitting behind
their yard looking at their wife in the

274
00:11:22,951 --> 00:11:24,900
Jacuzzi.
Oh Jesus Christ.

275
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:26,380
So it's a pervert.
Yeah,

276
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,130
exactly.
So it's like,

277
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,640
come on like,
oh,

278
00:11:29,641 --> 00:11:31,000
he has to do,
if he really doesn't want it there,

279
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:35,290
go back there and turn the thing off and
tell you that a coyote is staring at

280
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:35,910
their wife.

281
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:36,770
Yeah,
you'd be amazed.

282
00:11:36,771 --> 00:11:39,210
The calls we get about coyotes,
people just.

283
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,800
People are still not comfortable with
them being there even though they've

284
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,190
been there for a long time.
It's just people cannot get comfortable.

285
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:48,540
The idea of there being a,
a medium sized Predator in these urban

286
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,270
environments,
they're like the perfect size to almost

287
00:11:51,271 --> 00:11:53,100
get away with it too.
You know,

288
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,490
they,
it's not like a wolf.

289
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,590
Like if a wolf was around,
everybody be freaking out.

290
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:00,700
Like it's too big,
but it is like know 40 pounds,

291
00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:02,040
something like that.
And that's that.

292
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,120
That's a big coyote.
What's a small one?

293
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:07,360
A.
So our average is around 25 to 27

294
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:08,171
pounds.
Wow.

295
00:12:08,171 --> 00:12:09,720
Okay.
So you're really small.

296
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,200
They are.
And that's why I'm always like when

297
00:12:11,201 --> 00:12:12,330
people are so scared of,
I'm like,

298
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:15,580
it's really not that big of an animal.
I mean there's a lot of small dogs are

299
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:16,414
bigger than that.

300
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,280
They're smart though,
man.

301
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:20,080
They're really clever.
One of them.

302
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:23,860
He or she essentially what you would say
honey,

303
00:12:23,861 --> 00:12:27,490
Dick,
my dog and tricked my dog into a.

304
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:28,600
do you know what,
um,

305
00:12:28,601 --> 00:12:31,840
what it's like when a chicken molts they
actually have chickens as well.

306
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,550
Okay,
cool.

307
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,251
Yeah.
So,

308
00:12:33,251 --> 00:12:34,960
uh,
my chicken was molting so I had a

309
00:12:34,961 --> 00:12:38,770
separate her from the rest of the
chicken so she wasn't in a nesting box

310
00:12:38,771 --> 00:12:43,480
and I put her in a cage by herself.
If you let them sit in a cage for a few

311
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,430
days,
they figure out that they don't really

312
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,830
have an egg and then they go back to
their normal behavior.

313
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,060
So,
um,

314
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:52,840
this coyote was too small to knock over
the cage,

315
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:58,140
but my massive is big enough to do it.
So she literally tricked my massive into

316
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:02,380
coming out with her towards where the
chickens are.

317
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,330
He knocks over the cage.

318
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,540
She steals the chicken and hops over the
fence.

319
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,980
Wild.
You see all this happen.

320
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:14,310
I caught him with another chicken in his
mouth and uh,

321
00:13:14,351 --> 00:13:15,910
I was like,
you motherfucker.

322
00:13:15,911 --> 00:13:18,760
And then I see the coyote jumped over
the fence with the chicken,

323
00:13:18,761 --> 00:13:21,160
like he was with the coyote right next
to it.

324
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,430
He thought it was his friend,
like he was treating the kyle like,

325
00:13:24,431 --> 00:13:26,140
this is my friend.
She's cool.

326
00:13:26,141 --> 00:13:31,060
We hang out together and she tricked him
into knocking over this small pen

327
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,170
because he's like 140 pounds.
He just smashed that thing and broke it

328
00:13:35,171 --> 00:13:39,340
open and she grabbed the chicken thanks
pro oil and hopped over the fence.

329
00:13:39,341 --> 00:13:40,930
And I watched her.
I was sitting there,

330
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:45,220
I was playing like monopoly or something
with my wife and my kids are sitting in

331
00:13:45,221 --> 00:13:48,940
the living room and I see the coyote
running across the backyard with the

332
00:13:48,941 --> 00:13:52,660
chicken in its mouth and hopped over
this five foot fence.

333
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,740
Like it didn't even exist just just
right over the top of it.

334
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,210
I was like,
wow,

335
00:13:58,211 --> 00:14:00,700
that's crazy.
They're girly smart.

336
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,840
I mean heck,
living downtown,

337
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,690
they've got to be like crossing roads.
It's amazing.

338
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,610
Like I watched them walk up to these
busy roads,

339
00:14:06,611 --> 00:14:09,280
they stop about 10 feet shy,
kind of sit there listening.

340
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,280
Then they'll peek around the corner and
look both ways and then they'll run

341
00:14:12,281 --> 00:14:13,380
across.
Well,

342
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,580
I've heard that they understand traffic
lights.

343
00:14:15,581 --> 00:14:17,470
Now.
There was an article I read yesterday

344
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:21,700
about coyotes and traffic lights.
If there's real evidence that coyotes

345
00:14:21,701 --> 00:14:25,810
understand when that beep beep,
you know that sound that they use for a

346
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,410
blind people that coyotes understand
that that means the cars aren't allowed

347
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:31,200
to go and that's when they walk.
Oh,

348
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,650
I haven't seen that one.
That's interesting.

349
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,630
It doesn't surprise me.
I mean there.

350
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:37,570
It's incredible watching them move
around this urban environment and just

351
00:14:37,571 --> 00:14:39,490
dealing with us and dealing with
traffic.

352
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,370
Like they get around.
I mean they'll come out in the street

353
00:14:42,371 --> 00:14:45,100
all suddenly somebody will peak out in
the street to go into the car and

354
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:49,150
they'll cut between the cars and go down
the sidewalk like they figured out our

355
00:14:49,151 --> 00:14:51,130
movements and how to avoid us pretty
quick.

356
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,380
How many do you think there are in the
greater la area?

357
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,660
Oh,
I get asked that question a lot and it's

358
00:14:56,661 --> 00:15:00,710
a hard one to answer because we don't
know because they are pack animals so

359
00:15:00,711 --> 00:15:04,190
you could end up with easily.
It could be just two animals in an area

360
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:09,191
or it could be two adults with seven
young or it could even be five,

361
00:15:09,651 --> 00:15:10,311
six,
seven,

362
00:15:10,311 --> 00:15:13,610
10 adults together with with a pack of
young as well,

363
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,670
because a lot of times the young from
the year before may not disperse.

364
00:15:16,671 --> 00:15:19,970
If there's enough food available,
they'll keep hanging in there until they

365
00:15:19,971 --> 00:15:23,390
are able to find their own territory,
so whenever someone would give an

366
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,880
estimation,
it's really just a rough guess.

367
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:28,280
It's a very rough guest.
A lot of times what they'll do is

368
00:15:28,281 --> 00:15:29,570
they'll just try to be like,
okay,

369
00:15:29,571 --> 00:15:32,660
this is how big of an area caio uses and
then be like,

370
00:15:32,661 --> 00:15:35,630
okay,
there's this much area in La and throw a

371
00:15:35,631 --> 00:15:38,330
number out there,
but there's a lot of variables that come

372
00:15:38,331 --> 00:15:41,480
in and it has the.
Do you feel like the numbers increased

373
00:15:41,481 --> 00:15:45,380
over the past few years or?
Definitely not over the last few years.

374
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:48,890
It's possible over the long run because
I know there are some reports of places

375
00:15:48,891 --> 00:15:50,750
that there weren't coyotes,
like the Baldwin hills,

376
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:53,600
there was some work done where they
identify it,

377
00:15:53,601 --> 00:15:56,150
all the different animals there and
coyotes worn in their list.

378
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,810
So they use trail cams,
like what did they use to identify the

379
00:15:59,811 --> 00:16:02,990
animals back then I think they were
doing a lot of tracks surveys and just

380
00:16:02,991 --> 00:16:04,950
going out there into the field and
looking for them.

381
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:07,310
A track service.
Meaning like looking at the ground.

382
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,510
Exactly.
Yeah.

383
00:16:08,511 --> 00:16:10,940
And with coyotes they leave enough scat,
different places.

384
00:16:10,941 --> 00:16:13,520
Like if they were looking hard for them
they would've found them.

385
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,710
How can you tell the difference between
cat and dogs?

386
00:16:15,711 --> 00:16:17,720
Cat,
I'm usually,

387
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:21,230
so dogs get is almost always just dog
food.

388
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,700
Um,
and it doesn't.

389
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:27,760
These coyote scats ended up getting more
spiraled inside and so there'll be

390
00:16:28,101 --> 00:16:31,040
really tapered on.
The ends were dogs get can be tapered,

391
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,870
but it's usually just drastically
different.

392
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,560
Huh?
Why is it tapered?

393
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,200
A,
it's partially just the way their

394
00:16:36,201 --> 00:16:39,020
digestive system works and they're
getting all this hair in there because

395
00:16:39,021 --> 00:16:41,870
they're eating these animals.
And so it gets more and more spiraled as

396
00:16:41,871 --> 00:16:44,360
it comes out and we can tell them apart
from like bobcat,

397
00:16:44,361 --> 00:16:46,670
because bobcats kind of get this,
they're more almost,

398
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:50,120
I don't want to call it a pellet,
but they're smaller segmented and

399
00:16:50,121 --> 00:16:53,960
they're kind of just one side's concave,
one side's convicts of each pellet and

400
00:16:53,961 --> 00:16:56,630
so you can tell them apart,
that's actually can be more difficult

401
00:16:56,631 --> 00:16:57,920
for some people than the dog.

402
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,250
And the coyote.
I found some mountain lions,

403
00:17:00,251 --> 00:17:02,780
shit wants to Santa Monica,
not in Santa Monica,

404
00:17:02,781 --> 00:17:04,280
excuse me,
Santa Barbara.

405
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,920
And it was very disturbing because it
was a rope,

406
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:10,310
like a fat rope of hairy shit.
And I was like,

407
00:17:10,311 --> 00:17:14,120
what is this from?
And I sent it to a friend of mine who is

408
00:17:14,121 --> 00:17:16,760
a,
he's very knowledgeable about animals.

409
00:17:16,761 --> 00:17:18,320
He's like,
it's almost definitely a mountain lion.

410
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,700
It's like,
Whoa,

411
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,240
somebody's got got here.
No,

412
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,990
it was,
it was pretty thick rope,

413
00:17:23,991 --> 00:17:26,470
like a human sys log with,
with,

414
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,710
uh,
all this hair in it.

415
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,380
We actually have alliance study going in
our mountains too.

416
00:17:30,381 --> 00:17:31,940
We've been calling them outlines for a
long time.

417
00:17:31,941 --> 00:17:33,220
Sure.
You've probably heard of [inaudible] in

418
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,730
Griffith Park.
I have.

419
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,730
That's actually an animal that one of my
colleagues collared.

420
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,030
Oh yeah,
that's the famous photo of the Hollywood

421
00:17:41,031 --> 00:17:42,050
hills.
Exactly.

422
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,260
That is an amazing photo of that
enormous cat.

423
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,280
Would that collar on?
Yeah,

424
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,980
that was Steve Winters with National
Geographic.

425
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:49,980
Got that photo.
I mean,

426
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:52,380
it's pretty impressive.
He worked hard between him and my

427
00:17:52,381 --> 00:17:54,510
colleague Jeff.
They did a lot of work to get that

428
00:17:54,511 --> 00:17:55,590
photo.
And Jamie says,

429
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,690
go and pull that photo up when you take
a look at it.

430
00:17:57,691 --> 00:18:00,510
Now that is,
that is an iconic photograph,

431
00:18:00,511 --> 00:18:01,920
man.
You know what?

432
00:18:01,921 --> 00:18:04,320
I think we should have that photo in the
new studio.

433
00:18:04,321 --> 00:18:06,650
We should get a print of that.
Can we buy a print of that?

434
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,180
You know,
we're in Silica bioprinted that um,

435
00:18:09,181 --> 00:18:10,740
I believe you can get it from Steve
Winters.

436
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:11,911
Let's see.
Jamie,

437
00:18:11,911 --> 00:18:15,660
make a note of whoever's gentlemen is
and if he sells that because dad is

438
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,850
like,
that seems so crazy.

439
00:18:17,851 --> 00:18:21,720
It doesn't even look like a real photo
because the Hollywood sign is so perfect

440
00:18:21,721 --> 00:18:25,430
in the background and the cat is fucking
huge.

441
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,970
You know what's amazing about the
Hollywood sign?

442
00:18:26,971 --> 00:18:30,390
There's no lights on the Hollywood sign.
He got that photo because he was able to

443
00:18:30,391 --> 00:18:33,510
do enough camera work that he made the
Hollywood sign Claire Out.

444
00:18:33,511 --> 00:18:36,110
That's just from lights from the city.
Really.

445
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,620
If you look at the Hollywood sign at
night,

446
00:18:37,621 --> 00:18:40,110
it's not lit up like that.
Wow.

447
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,080
Look at the forearm on them thing.
Yeah,

448
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,520
I mean that's like a thigh.
Yeah.

449
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,960
So it's a huge cat.
Yup.

450
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,340
How big do you think that is?
A big male.

451
00:18:50,341 --> 00:18:54,390
I think the last time.
So we've captured him three or four

452
00:18:54,391 --> 00:18:59,391
times now and I think the last time he
was about 101 20.

453
00:19:00,451 --> 00:19:01,261
One 30,
I believe.

454
00:19:01,261 --> 00:19:03,390
I'm not positive of that,
but it's somewhere in that area.

455
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,100
Oh yeah.
He's a good size cat.

456
00:19:05,101 --> 00:19:06,180
I mean,
what's amazing?

457
00:19:06,181 --> 00:19:09,510
He's running in Griffith Park.
He'd never leaves the Griffith Park

458
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:13,050
General area because he's blocked by
freeways and yet there hasn't been any

459
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:15,690
conflicts with him and people besides
the time he got underneath that guy's

460
00:19:15,691 --> 00:19:18,070
house living of him.

461
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:21,120
But Jesus Christ.
That's so weird.

462
00:19:21,121 --> 00:19:23,770
So joggers,
no one gets interrupted by him.

463
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:27,300
Interrupt is a funny word.
Jack is a better word.

464
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:30,210
He doesn't.
It doesn't mess with people at all.

465
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,980
No.
We get sightings everywhere where people

466
00:19:31,981 --> 00:19:32,791
report it.
But yeah,

467
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,950
we haven't had anything,
any conflicts with them,

468
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,620
which has been amazing.
I mean he's four.

469
00:19:37,621 --> 00:19:40,350
He's got the smallest home range of any
mountain lion,

470
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:43,020
male mountain lion that we've know of.
Like.

471
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:45,540
So what is like a square mile?
Is he just the park?

472
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:47,100
He's just the park.
I mean he goes,

473
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:50,280
he's been up by like universal studios
right in there once or twice.

474
00:19:50,281 --> 00:19:52,290
Like in some green strip through there,
but for the most part,

475
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,090
yeah,
he's just hanging out in the park and

476
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,840
dwp property next to the park.
How big is the park?

477
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,260
I wish I could call that number off the
top of my head.

478
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,580
Just roughly.
If you had to guess who?

479
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,590
Yeah,
I'm not good with that.

480
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:08,370
Yeah,
like 4,300 acres or something like that.

481
00:20:08,371 --> 00:20:10,800
Okay.
See the biggest in America or maybe the

482
00:20:10,801 --> 00:20:12,060
world?
Urban Park.

483
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,640
It's a pretty big park.
It is.

484
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,250
But when you compare that to mountain
lions,

485
00:20:17,251 --> 00:20:20,100
that our main mountains,
we usually think to mountain lions can

486
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,400
live in the Santa Monica mountains,
which is about 150,000 acres.

487
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:28,890
So his range is pretty small,
4,300 compared to about 75,000 acres.

488
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,520
That's incredible.
And he's mostly eating deer heat,

489
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:36,240
some coyotes and raccoons.
But it's almost most of the,

490
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,220
most of all of our mountain lions,
all their diets,

491
00:20:38,221 --> 00:20:39,270
dear.
Well,

492
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:41,850
that's one of the reasons why there's so
few deer in California.

493
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:46,590
I hear that when we don't,
we don't know if that's truly what's

494
00:20:46,591 --> 00:20:49,360
going a mountain lions,
they do kind of self regulate.

495
00:20:49,361 --> 00:20:53,620
So the big males usually killed the
smaller mills and so they do kind of

496
00:20:53,621 --> 00:20:55,330
control their own populations of some
level.

497
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:56,560
Oh,
that's interesting.

498
00:20:56,561 --> 00:20:58,630
So the competition,
they kill competent.

499
00:20:58,631 --> 00:21:00,460
Did Not.
They're not cannibals though.

500
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:02,980
Uh,
I don't believe they eat them.

501
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,710
They usually just kill them.
That's interesting.

502
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:09,610
So do they kill them to bring the
females to Asteris or they'd do them

503
00:21:09,611 --> 00:21:11,980
just because their competition?
We believe it's just because it's

504
00:21:11,981 --> 00:21:14,410
competition because they're usually
killing those yearling.

505
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,960
Okay.
Males killing them once they were

506
00:21:16,961 --> 00:21:18,220
independent.
Exactly.

507
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,271
So,
um,

508
00:21:19,271 --> 00:21:21,220
and they also,
we have had them kill a female lion as

509
00:21:21,221 --> 00:21:23,110
well.
So really it's not that simple.

510
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,343
Hmm.
Yeah.

511
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,230
That's interesting.
And is this in the park?

512
00:21:26,231 --> 00:21:27,550
You found this?
Yeah.

513
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:30,010
Wow.
So you find a dead mountain line in the

514
00:21:30,011 --> 00:21:31,630
park.
I mean they have radio collars on them,

515
00:21:31,631 --> 00:21:36,270
so we kind of know what's going on now.
Is there any concern,

516
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,430
like does anybody make the argument that
they shouldn't be there?

517
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,810
Does anybody ever say,
hey,

518
00:21:40,811 --> 00:21:42,070
you know,
this is where I live.

519
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:45,070
I don't want this cat here.
Why do you guys let this thing is a

520
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,130
giant Predator wandering around our
neighborhood?

521
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,200
Yeah,
I mean we definitely hear that but we

522
00:21:50,201 --> 00:21:52,990
also get the other side as well,
a lot where they want to protect every

523
00:21:52,991 --> 00:21:54,580
lion.
I mean,

524
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,770
same thing with coyotes.
People don't want the coyotes.

525
00:21:56,771 --> 00:21:59,410
They're coyotes.
Even more tricky because we've tried to

526
00:21:59,411 --> 00:22:03,790
kill coyotes for a long time to try to
get them out of areas and we have not

527
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:04,840
been successful.
I mean,

528
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:08,320
places like Chicago with coyotes,
I mean they'll go through and do

529
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,600
removals,
like a lot of the landowners will do

530
00:22:10,601 --> 00:22:13,360
removals and the coyotes has come back
pretty quickly.

531
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:14,411
Interesting.
Though.

532
00:22:14,411 --> 00:22:17,290
It's really not that effective.
Let me start trying to remove these

533
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:17,710
animals.
Yeah.

534
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,970
Especially coyotes.
Right?

535
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:21,230
They're so crafty.
Um,

536
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,670
I've read a really disturbing article
about mountain lions where they were

537
00:22:24,671 --> 00:22:29,200
talking about the number of mountain
lions that are killed every year by.

538
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:34,250
I'm a professional mountain lion hunters
that the government hires because

539
00:22:35,141 --> 00:22:38,890
they're preying on cats and dogs and
that they said that 50 percent of these

540
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:41,380
animals,
this was around the San Francisco area,

541
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,880
that 50 percent of their diet was
domestic animals.

542
00:22:45,881 --> 00:22:47,950
Like domestic cats and dogs.
Yeah.

543
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:50,920
I'm not familiar with that one,
but we definitely haven't seen that with

544
00:22:50,921 --> 00:22:53,420
ours.
So this one is just got a good supply of

545
00:22:53,421 --> 00:22:56,230
deer and that's just what it's eating on
a regular basis.

546
00:22:56,231 --> 00:22:57,280
That's what it seems like.
I mean,

547
00:22:57,281 --> 00:22:59,440
even Griffith Park,
that's what they're focused on.

548
00:22:59,441 --> 00:22:59,891
I mean,
like I said,

549
00:22:59,891 --> 00:23:02,200
they also killed the coyotes and
raccoons and stuff as well.

550
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,690
But sure,
that the other thing that was really

551
00:23:04,691 --> 00:23:07,400
disturbing about that article,
because it was the,

552
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:10,810
the author was trying to make a
connection between missing children,

553
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,880
you know,
they were talking about,

554
00:23:12,881 --> 00:23:14,620
uh,
several cases over the years where

555
00:23:14,621 --> 00:23:16,540
children were missing and never found
again.

556
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:19,090
And these are the same areas where these
mountain lions roaming and they were

557
00:23:19,091 --> 00:23:20,980
wondering whether or not that had been
the case.

558
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:23,410
That makes you go,
whoa.

559
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:24,201
Yeah,
I mean,

560
00:23:24,201 --> 00:23:27,870
I think it's probably more likely human
caused then wildlife caused.

561
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,120
I mean,
maybe we're,

562
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,730
we're way creepier than these animals
are.

563
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:34,360
That's true.
But do you remember about two years ago,

564
00:23:34,361 --> 00:23:36,760
uh,
there was a case in Cupertino right near

565
00:23:36,761 --> 00:23:39,700
the apple campus where a mountain lion
attack to kid.

566
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:40,811
And,
uh,

567
00:23:40,811 --> 00:23:43,030
the father had a fight the mountain lion
off.

568
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,890
I mean,
these stories definitely pop up every

569
00:23:44,891 --> 00:23:46,850
once in a while.
But we also have lots of places where

570
00:23:46,851 --> 00:23:48,940
there's lions and there's no issues,
right?

571
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,810
Our mountains,
we haven't had a light,

572
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,970
a human lion issue.
I mean,

573
00:23:52,971 --> 00:23:54,860
we've had livestock taken,
but that's about it.

574
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:58,010
And we're talking our park.
That gets huge amount of visitors.

575
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:01,430
Griffin lion will griffith,
but also the whole Santa Monica

576
00:24:01,431 --> 00:24:04,130
mountains,
so we're part of the Santa Monica

577
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:06,470
Mountains National Recreation area and
we've got at any given time we could

578
00:24:06,471 --> 00:24:09,350
have 12 to 15 lions in there.
Wow.

579
00:24:09,351 --> 00:24:14,351
Really?
And we've never had a human lion issue

580
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:17,960
besides the livestock.
What is the big issue when they do

581
00:24:17,961 --> 00:24:20,660
attack people?
Because it's always like someone either

582
00:24:20,661 --> 00:24:24,530
running or on a bike,
is it they think that the person is

583
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:26,630
trying to get away?
Is it like a cat thing,

584
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:27,530
like a regular kid,
you know,

585
00:24:27,531 --> 00:24:30,920
like if you roll a ball of yarn in front
of a cat that just jumped on it.

586
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,810
Yeah.
I don't think we really have a full

587
00:24:32,811 --> 00:24:34,640
understanding,
but it probably has something to do with

588
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:39,641
the prey drive because I've read a few,
a mountain lion attacks on people that

589
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:43,020
had to do with mountain bikes and I was.

590
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:45,740
I was thinking like why would they want
to attack someone on a bike?

591
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:48,000
It seems like a bike would be scary.
Yeah.

592
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:49,590
I mean,
they're an ambush Predator and they're

593
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:52,850
big animals so they're not used to
having anything bigger than them take

594
00:24:52,851 --> 00:24:56,210
them on so they're not.
They're not fearful of most things.

595
00:24:56,211 --> 00:24:57,800
I mean a lot of times when people see
the lions,

596
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:01,430
they don't run and so people freak out,
but that's actually not that uncommon

597
00:25:01,431 --> 00:25:04,100
for them just to kind of sit there and
look at you and judge the situation,

598
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:06,200
try to figure out what they can do with
you.

599
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:09,830
They should eat you hope that's not what
they're thinking,

600
00:25:09,831 --> 00:25:13,550
but most likely not.
Most likely not like what are the

601
00:25:13,551 --> 00:25:16,900
numbers of attacks on people?
Do you know if you had a.

602
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,580
you'd have to talk to my colleague.
I'm definitely not the lion guy in our

603
00:25:19,581 --> 00:25:20,090
office.

604
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:23,090
Some much more focused on.
Do you remember the last time you heard

605
00:25:23,091 --> 00:25:27,350
of a lion attack on people?
I'm now and I've taught my head.

606
00:25:27,351 --> 00:25:30,080
I mean it might've been at apple thing
or there was.

607
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,220
There was attack in Orange County quite
a while back,

608
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,860
but that's really it.
It's not that common.

609
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,530
There's a magic number of lions that are
here.

610
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:43,310
This is a mountain lion in San Juan
Capistrano that's been attacking this

611
00:25:43,311 --> 00:25:45,110
farm.
A buddy of mine,

612
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,540
Ian Mccall,
who's a UFC fighter,

613
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,460
has a friend who owns this farm and this
mountain lion has been hitting this farm

614
00:25:52,461 --> 00:25:57,350
every now and again and the other day it
killed 37 ducks in a goat,

615
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:01,400
just goes on a rampage and doesn't even
eat them.

616
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:05,390
Just fucks them up and leaves and so
what we usually see with them is,

617
00:26:05,391 --> 00:26:07,760
I mean because they almost always eat
what they kill.

618
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,710
It's just when they kill something in a
farm,

619
00:26:09,711 --> 00:26:12,590
they usually end up being uncomfortable
afterwards because we come in,

620
00:26:12,591 --> 00:26:14,810
we see the situation,
things change and so they don't come

621
00:26:14,811 --> 00:26:17,270
back because they'll feed on a deer for
a week or more.

622
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:18,531
So it's,
it's.

623
00:26:18,531 --> 00:26:20,480
I think it's more of a factor when they
leave those things.

624
00:26:20,481 --> 00:26:21,770
It's more that they just all of a sudden
like,

625
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,240
oh crap,
what I do,

626
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:25,760
I gotta get Outta here.
Why they killed 37.

627
00:26:25,761 --> 00:26:28,490
Then it just prey drive.
I mean they can't help themselves.

628
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,860
They get in.
There's times when they get in pins with

629
00:26:30,861 --> 00:26:34,130
bigger animals to things like llamas and
stuff where they'll end up killing

630
00:26:34,131 --> 00:26:37,570
multiple animals just because they get
into this pan and all.

631
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:40,640
Suddenly they're jumping around making
all these noises and so then the animals

632
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:43,860
get excited.
I made it just like dog dogs are getting

633
00:26:43,861 --> 00:26:44,460
after chickens.

634
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:47,340
All the sudden the dog goes in and kills
the whole flock of chickens.

635
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,930
Right.
Same type of deal.

636
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:51,130
They just can't help themselves.
Yeah.

637
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,490
There's that one that's in the Santa
Monica Mountains.

638
00:26:53,491 --> 00:26:54,720
What is it?
P 52.

639
00:26:54,721 --> 00:26:56,660
Is that the name of it?
P 45,

640
00:26:56,661 --> 00:26:58,110
45.
I'm guessing if that's what you're

641
00:26:58,111 --> 00:27:00,660
talking about.
The one that killed a bunch of llamas

642
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:04,560
and the woman got a depredation permit
to kill the mountain lion.

643
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:07,170
Then people freaked out and started
sending her death threats.

644
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:08,760
Yeah,
got a little out of control.

645
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:12,420
It's like it was really creepy listening
to this woman's position because she

646
00:27:12,421 --> 00:27:14,420
didn't know what to do because she's,
you know,

647
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:18,210
she lives there.
She's got this farm and this big old cat

648
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,430
is,
keeps coming in and fucking up like 10

649
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,770
llamas in a,
in a setting.

650
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:25,200
Yeah.
So us and National Wildlife Federation

651
00:27:25,201 --> 00:27:28,200
actually started working with her to try
to help pin or animals that better

652
00:27:28,201 --> 00:27:30,990
because a lot of it just comes to making
sure your animals a secure at night.

653
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:33,060
Is that what it is?
Like you have to figure out a way to

654
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:36,500
close the areas of the mountain lion
can't get into exactly what did she

655
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,710
take?
Anything that complicated.

656
00:27:37,711 --> 00:27:41,370
We actually held a workshop for people
in the local vicinity and we'll be

657
00:27:41,371 --> 00:27:44,900
holding more to teach livestock owners
how to secure their animals so that

658
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,680
stuff doesn't happen.
Is there a way they can,

659
00:27:46,681 --> 00:27:50,790
um,
do something that like a emits a sound

660
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,450
or something that scares them off.
So there are some devices out there that

661
00:27:54,451 --> 00:27:57,210
are being tested and being used in some
vicinities,

662
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,330
but nothing's 100 percent.
The problem with a lot of devices,

663
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,520
you've got livestock moving around so
they're going to be triggering the

664
00:28:02,521 --> 00:28:05,100
devices all night.
So it,

665
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:06,990
it's,
it's kind of a tough situation.

666
00:28:06,991 --> 00:28:10,260
The best thing is to try to pin the
animals up so you have to put something

667
00:28:10,261 --> 00:28:11,010
with a roof on it.

668
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:12,810
So the mountain lion can't get in it
over the top.

669
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:16,170
Exactly.
So when you're talking about an animal

670
00:28:16,171 --> 00:28:17,320
like that,
like when they,

671
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,090
sometimes they capture them and then
they move them to a new area.

672
00:28:21,091 --> 00:28:22,740
Right?
Um,

673
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:26,670
that is very rare to happen.
Is it really?

674
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:28,230
Yeah,
like when we kept our animals,

675
00:28:28,231 --> 00:28:31,770
we don't move anybody just let them go
right back to where they are and we call

676
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,000
our own.
We take blood,

677
00:28:33,001 --> 00:28:35,580
we do what we need to do to them and
then we just let them go right there.

678
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,240
So it was the idea like mess with them
as little as possible.

679
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:39,930
Exactly.
Yeah.

680
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:41,790
We didn't have to capture them,
we wouldn't capture them.

681
00:28:41,791 --> 00:28:43,740
We would just throw it.
There was a way to get a color on the

682
00:28:43,741 --> 00:28:46,680
animal without touching it.
We would do that like maybe a dark that

683
00:28:46,681 --> 00:28:48,840
shoots a gps unit in him or something.

684
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,550
Yeah,
whatever the technology is,

685
00:28:50,551 --> 00:28:53,070
if it ever comes up that way,
most wildlife people would prefer

686
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,590
because the least we have to do it on.
The more we're going to understand their

687
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,820
behaviors.
Yeah.

688
00:28:56,821 --> 00:28:58,560
I would imagine this cat and Griffith
Park.

689
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,720
You said it's been captured three times.
Yeah,

690
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,850
that's kind of crazy.
This can be for.

691
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:03,571
I can't remember.
I'm not.

692
00:29:03,571 --> 00:29:05,100
Like I said,
I'm not the guy that does all the lion

693
00:29:05,101 --> 00:29:06,150
work,
so I just help out.

694
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:08,730
The cat must be like Jesus Christ.
So they got me again,

695
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:13,560
like it's probably like I'm so tired of
wearing the stupid jewelry they keep

696
00:29:13,561 --> 00:29:14,520
putting on me.
Yeah.

697
00:29:14,521 --> 00:29:14,941
Why?
Don't know.

698
00:29:14,941 --> 00:29:16,700
You might've saw the pictures to where
he got.

699
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,960
He was really sick with mange.
Oh yeah,

700
00:29:18,961 --> 00:29:19,950
that's right.
Yeah.

701
00:29:19,951 --> 00:29:23,970
And so they got a medication and so we
caught him and we have a topical

702
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:25,980
medication that we can give animals.

703
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,300
We do it,
the bobcats and stuff.

704
00:29:27,301 --> 00:29:32,301
So what we found with this mange disease
is that it's caused by a rodenticides.

705
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:36,870
So all these rat poisons we put out
there basically ends up getting into the

706
00:29:36,871 --> 00:29:38,880
mountain lions and bobcats.
And the coyotes,

707
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:42,820
there seems to be some sort of
correlation between those poisons and

708
00:29:42,821 --> 00:29:44,500
why these animals get sick.
Oh,

709
00:29:44,501 --> 00:29:46,480
is that him right there with mange?
Yep.

710
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,423
That's.
Yeah,

711
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,990
that's fascinating.
That is a real issue with people

712
00:29:49,991 --> 00:29:51,390
poisoning,
um,

713
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:53,910
these animals so that it also affects
owls.

714
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:58,950
Apparently that rat poison is causing a
drop in the owl population because our

715
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:02,020
are getting ahold of these rats are sick
from the,

716
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,011
the.
Oh,

717
00:30:03,011 --> 00:30:03,970
that's interesting.
Oh,

718
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:04,691
it's amazing.
I mean,

719
00:30:04,691 --> 00:30:06,470
to think of a mountain lion getting rat
poison.

720
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,140
It's not like they're out there hunting
rats,

721
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,090
but it's because they're killing the
coyotes,

722
00:30:10,091 --> 00:30:12,250
the thinner that are eating the rats
that are sick.

723
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,900
Oh yeah.
It's happening.

724
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,700
So we're a mountain lion would need a
rat.

725
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:18,160
I mean they might,
but for them to eat enough rats,

726
00:30:18,161 --> 00:30:19,620
they're not just sitting there focusing
around.

727
00:30:19,621 --> 00:30:22,870
So it's really a great source for that.
So they're,

728
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:26,050
they're definitely focusing more on the
coyotes and the bigger prey.

729
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,440
I can't believe there's that many
mountain lions in the Santa Monica

730
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,340
Mountains.
That's crazy.

731
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:33,910
Yeah.
And these are colored mountain lions,

732
00:30:33,911 --> 00:30:35,230
correct?
Not all of them.

733
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:38,410
There's definitely some out there that
are uncolored we can only get what we

734
00:30:38,411 --> 00:30:39,650
can capture.
So.

735
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,560
And so like when you make an estimate of
like,

736
00:30:41,561 --> 00:30:42,371
what'd you say?
15.

737
00:30:42,371 --> 00:30:45,040
Is that what you said?
That we think that's our upper size

738
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:46,510
limit.
How many of them are collared?

739
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:50,410
Um,
I think right now we're at around eight

740
00:30:50,411 --> 00:30:51,520
or nine.
Yeah.

741
00:30:51,521 --> 00:30:52,960
I wish,
I wish jeff was in here.

742
00:30:52,961 --> 00:30:54,970
He can answer these questions a lot
better than me because like I said,

743
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,380
I'll get jeff in here next time.

744
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:57,310
Yeah.
So it's,

745
00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:02,290
it's so fascinating because California
is such a unique area in that we are

746
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,970
very urban,
you know,

747
00:31:03,971 --> 00:31:08,971
but we're real spread out and we've got
the Santa Monica mountains right there,

748
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,430
like in Topanga right there.
I mean to pay.

749
00:31:12,431 --> 00:31:15,120
I have a buddy lives in Topanga.
You go in his backyard,

750
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:17,050
you would swear to God you were in
Colorado or something.

751
00:31:17,051 --> 00:31:17,640
I mean,
it just,

752
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,270
it,
it seems like the wilderness,

753
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:21,010
you know,
the mountains are amazing.

754
00:31:21,011 --> 00:31:23,290
I mean it's 155,000 acres.
Oh,

755
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:26,020
Jamie's got a map he pulled up of all
the mountain lions.

756
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,220
Wow.
We'll get them all.

757
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:30,580
Jesus,
so obviously the Santa Monica mountains

758
00:31:30,581 --> 00:31:31,850
are just.
They're south of the one.

759
00:31:31,851 --> 00:31:35,110
Oh one basically.
So the park is basically from the

760
00:31:35,111 --> 00:31:39,250
Hollywood hills out the point Magoo and
then incorporates most of Malibu and

761
00:31:39,251 --> 00:31:41,440
then it goes a little bit up into the
hills,

762
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:44,450
but the mountains themselves are mostly
south of [inaudible].

763
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:49,360
This is such a unique place to live that
were so sort of surrounded by nature and

764
00:31:49,361 --> 00:31:52,840
a lot of ways and there's so many
different places like you could go to

765
00:31:52,841 --> 00:31:56,740
big bear and an hour and a half and
you're in the woods.

766
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,810
I mean you are literally in the
wilderness.

767
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:00,680
That's a great thing about La.
Yeah.

768
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:03,580
I like living here and it's pretty cool.
It's pretty cool.

769
00:32:03,581 --> 00:32:08,581
But people are super uncomfortable with
the fact that this wildlife sort of

770
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:13,900
interfaces with our urban environment
and that's where guys like you come in,

771
00:32:13,901 --> 00:32:14,591
right?
Yeah.

772
00:32:14,591 --> 00:32:16,480
I mean we're.
We're hoping to help reduce some of

773
00:32:16,481 --> 00:32:18,970
these conflicts and a lot of it comes to
what we do.

774
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:21,250
It's not so much with animals.
I mean with coyotes,

775
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:25,000
a huge amount of the issues are because
somebody next door to use feeding them

776
00:32:25,001 --> 00:32:26,160
and so the coyotes hanging around.

777
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,720
It's really common like the people leave
out food.

778
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,130
Yeah.
Sometimes it's intentional.

779
00:32:30,131 --> 00:32:32,530
Sometimes it's not like feeding your dog
outside.

780
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,560
It's never a good idea.
Having fruit trees in your backyard that

781
00:32:35,561 --> 00:32:38,440
are just dropping fruit constantly and
no one's picking it up or cleaning it

782
00:32:38,441 --> 00:32:40,490
up.
That's attract and so it's all bringing

783
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:41,690
in coyotes,
raccoons,

784
00:32:41,691 --> 00:32:42,800
possums,
skunks,

785
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,140
all these animals are coming in and take
advantage of that stuff.

786
00:32:45,141 --> 00:32:49,460
So do you think they eat olives?
Have we seen all lives?

787
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,560
Probably would take advantage of him
here and there,

788
00:32:51,561 --> 00:32:54,250
but I don't think it's like a super big
food source forum.

789
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:57,080
I haven't seen any spots.
So we've been doing this diet study for

790
00:32:57,081 --> 00:32:59,300
a little while now.
And Olives or not one that pops up

791
00:32:59,301 --> 00:33:01,890
regularly because my dogs eat them.
That's why I'm asking.

792
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:05,120
My Dog's catch them when they fall out
of trees and it's the same yard.

793
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:07,040
Obviously we're the coyotes had been
visiting.

794
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:08,720
Yeah,
I mean I wouldn't rule it out,

795
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:10,580
but definitely if you have anything like
figs,

796
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:13,280
we find tons of figs and the scat.
Yeah,

797
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,820
so they really liked figs.
They do and figs fruit twice a year.

798
00:33:16,821 --> 00:33:21,260
A lot of the varieties of figs and so
they're there a lot so the coyotes just

799
00:33:21,261 --> 00:33:22,800
kind of learned to key in on him.
Oh,

800
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,230
okay.
And probably a lot of calories.

801
00:33:24,231 --> 00:33:25,790
There are two former.
Exactly.

802
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:28,430
What are those little tiny red berries
that they like to eat?

803
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:30,620
A pirate Kantha maybe.
Is that what it is?

804
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:32,300
I think so.
That's not even edible.

805
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:33,134
The humans,
right?

806
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,460
Not.
I don't think so,

807
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:35,960
but Kyle is Canadian.
Yeah.

808
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,640
I mean whether it's edible to us or
whether we would want to eat a different

809
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,700
question,
I guess.

810
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,730
Yeah,
there's a lot grind in.

811
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,390
Exactly.
They're eating a lot of things that we

812
00:33:44,391 --> 00:33:45,224
would not touch.

813
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,460
Yeah,
no kidding.

814
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,220
I mean they,
they go pick stuff up off the road and

815
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:51,950
nasty little it looks like just putting
on the road.

816
00:33:51,951 --> 00:33:53,960
I've seen them grab stuff.
Yeah,

817
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:55,280
I seen coyotes.
They're just,

818
00:33:55,281 --> 00:33:56,061
they're crazy.
I mean,

819
00:33:56,061 --> 00:33:58,850
there's a lot of these talk about
Katie's going after cats and all that

820
00:33:58,851 --> 00:34:00,800
and there's no question that eat cats.
I've seen them.

821
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:04,940
One of our collared animals was actually
eating a cat in to have his pack mates

822
00:34:04,941 --> 00:34:07,130
were sitting there just eating this cat
in somebody's front yard,

823
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,860
which I'd never seen.
I knew they.

824
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,640
Adam.
Have you seen that video of the coyote

825
00:34:11,641 --> 00:34:14,000
eaten the cat that someone captured in
Los Angeles?

826
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:15,493
Uh,
I don't think so.

827
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:19,280
It's a great video because this,
these people from their car or film in

828
00:34:19,281 --> 00:34:23,630
this coyote that's right there on the
street in busy la and it just staring at

829
00:34:23,631 --> 00:34:25,120
people chewing on this cat that.

830
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,560
Yeah,
that's like Jesus Christ.

831
00:34:27,561 --> 00:34:30,080
We played it for Dan Flores and Dan has
the opinion,

832
00:34:30,081 --> 00:34:35,030
he's of the opinion that a lot of these
cats that are getting killed by these

833
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:37,640
coyotes,
like here's some coyotes just wandering

834
00:34:37,641 --> 00:34:38,480
across the street.
I mean,

835
00:34:38,481 --> 00:34:42,320
this is really crazy because this is as
urban as it gets.

836
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:45,320
I mean,
busy street and this kyle is just

837
00:34:45,321 --> 00:34:49,220
hanging out and so these people followed
this coyote all around the street.

838
00:34:49,221 --> 00:34:50,950
Does it look like that as a collar?
What did I say?

839
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,390
No,
no color,

840
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:57,050
but it,
Dan thinks that the coyotes are eating

841
00:34:57,051 --> 00:34:59,420
the cats because they're competitive
predators.

842
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:03,530
Um,
so that has definitely been seen with

843
00:35:03,531 --> 00:35:08,120
things like fog of areas.
So just chilling,

844
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:09,890
eating the cat right in front of
everybody.

845
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,400
I mean,
that's crazy that they actually see it.

846
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:14,930
I'm guessing they didn't see it actually
catch the.

847
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,370
No,
because the cat is stiff.

848
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:18,440
Stiff.
That cat is that cat.

849
00:35:18,441 --> 00:35:19,910
It looks like it's been dead for quite a
while,

850
00:35:19,911 --> 00:35:23,960
but he's just chewing on that cat in
front of everybody that coyote actually

851
00:35:23,961 --> 00:35:26,690
you see how it's face looks kind of bald
headed may actually have.

852
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,850
And you think that could be from rat
poison?

853
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:30,200
Uh,
with the coyotes.

854
00:35:30,201 --> 00:35:31,880
It's a little more complicated than
that.

855
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:34,490
Um,
we think it's a different type of Maine

856
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,100
they get.
So we don't think that's directly tied

857
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,490
rat poisons.
It could be still,

858
00:35:38,491 --> 00:35:40,680
but where does,
it's kind of uncertain with those guys.

859
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,450
And some of it is because of bugs as
well.

860
00:35:42,451 --> 00:35:45,270
Right?
So Maine is actually caused by a mite.

861
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,370
Yeah.
And it just irritates their skin and

862
00:35:47,371 --> 00:35:48,870
they end up scratching their own for
off.

863
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:49,913
Oh,
that's it.

864
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,120
Yeah.
Really?

865
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,850
Yeah.
I thought it just felt like it.

866
00:35:52,851 --> 00:35:53,700
That one cat.
So like,

867
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:56,670
oh,
that's my friend a dude.

868
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,730
That cat is so crazy.
He's just sitting there watching this

869
00:35:59,731 --> 00:36:00,790
coyote.
Yeah.

870
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,180
So what a dumb cat.
Well,

871
00:36:03,181 --> 00:36:06,780
I saw a cat in the middle of a street.
A coyote was walking down the street.

872
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:09,630
I thought it was a bag of garbage.
I was about 100 yards away and I was

873
00:36:09,631 --> 00:36:10,860
sitting here watching this video,
go to it.

874
00:36:10,861 --> 00:36:11,380
I was like,
oh,

875
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,790
was going to get into this garbage?
Next thing I know there's coyotes

876
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:16,380
circles at three times.
Walks off also.

877
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:18,720
Anything jumps up and walks away.
I was like,

878
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,340
whoa.
Did I just see that?

879
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,330
Wow,
I cannot believe it because even like,

880
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:25,140
I know it's complicated,
but I was like,

881
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:27,750
that was a pretty easy prey.
They could have just grabbed it.

882
00:36:27,751 --> 00:36:30,990
So coyote is much faster than cast.
Is that what it is?

883
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:31,861
Well,
and that's an area.

884
00:36:31,861 --> 00:36:34,650
Didn't have to be faster.
The cat was just laying there like it

885
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:38,580
could have grabbed it at any point and I
wonder why the cat felt calm enough to

886
00:36:38,581 --> 00:36:39,150
do that.

887
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:39,731
Yeah.
I don't know.

888
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:41,730
And why they didn't go after it.
I have no idea.

889
00:36:41,731 --> 00:36:44,010
I think it's just,
it's just not that simple that they go

890
00:36:44,011 --> 00:36:45,790
after every single cat.
Yeah.

891
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:47,310
Well they obviously don't.
Right?

892
00:36:47,311 --> 00:36:49,330
Yeah.
Now you.

893
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:52,320
So you say that it is fairly common that
people feed them.

894
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,180
It is.
I've just,

895
00:36:54,181 --> 00:36:56,220
with tracking these animals,
I've been to a bunch of places where

896
00:36:56,221 --> 00:36:59,310
people feel like they need to put dog
food or cat food out on the street just

897
00:36:59,311 --> 00:37:02,070
for the coyotes are the skunks or
raccoons or whatever.

898
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:04,740
They're feeding something intentionally
out there and then the coyotes are

899
00:37:04,741 --> 00:37:06,840
taking advantage.
And do you talk to these people?

900
00:37:06,841 --> 00:37:09,870
Do you have to have.
So I will occasionally.

901
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,440
Usually I just tell animal services
about it and they'll talk to them or if

902
00:37:13,441 --> 00:37:15,780
it's somebody I'm like already having
some sort of communication with,

903
00:37:15,781 --> 00:37:16,860
I'll definitely be like,
eh,

904
00:37:16,861 --> 00:37:18,150
you don't really need to feed these
guys.

905
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:20,640
They're doing fine on their own.
Yeah.

906
00:37:20,641 --> 00:37:22,410
All you're doing is encouraging them to
come here.

907
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:25,740
Do they get that?
Do deal with some nutty animal people

908
00:37:25,741 --> 00:37:27,060
that don't get that?
Yeah,

909
00:37:27,061 --> 00:37:28,950
we definitely deal with some people that
don't understand.

910
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:33,480
They feel like these animals are going
to starve to death or die of dehydration

911
00:37:33,481 --> 00:37:35,070
if they don't put that bowl of water out
there.

912
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:37,250
So crazy.
So yeah.

913
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:41,850
Dan Flores had a woman who came to him
and was doing a documentary on saving

914
00:37:41,851 --> 00:37:45,960
the coyote and he was like,
I don't think you understand,

915
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:50,360
like they're doing great.
They've expanded their range incredibly.

916
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,840
Like they're living in every big city
around.

917
00:37:52,841 --> 00:37:54,690
I mean from New York,
Chicago,

918
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:57,330
Toronto,
and that's all saying.

919
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,860
Yeah,
it's crazy.

920
00:37:58,861 --> 00:37:59,850
They're everywhere.
Yeah.

921
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:04,450
They literally are in every state in
every city in the entire country except

922
00:38:04,451 --> 00:38:07,590
for Hawaii.
Except why puts what that is so bizarre

923
00:38:07,591 --> 00:38:10,040
that the think that are in Queens during
they've,

924
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:12,960
they've found them in the bronx was
amazing.

925
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,960
They've expanded their range over a
fairly short time span to.

926
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:17,460
I mean,
it's really just since Europeans had

927
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:20,310
been here that they've been able to kind
of expand out and do that and that's

928
00:38:20,311 --> 00:38:22,410
through all this time.
It was trying to kill him and all that

929
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,400
and so I get a lot of people that want
to remove coyotes from urban

930
00:38:26,401 --> 00:38:27,211
environments.
I'm like,

931
00:38:27,211 --> 00:38:29,040
well,
we've been trying to do that for a long

932
00:38:29,041 --> 00:38:31,950
time and it's not working.
What is the solution then?

933
00:38:31,951 --> 00:38:35,320
The solution is just to sort of mitigate
their impact on us.

934
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:37,240
I think we need to change what we do.
Yeah,

935
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:39,820
I mean it's about not making sure we
don't have food out there.

936
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:42,550
I mean if the more food they have,
it's been shown.

937
00:38:42,551 --> 00:38:47,140
Coyotes can increase their litter sizes
and so they produce more coyotes and so

938
00:38:47,141 --> 00:38:50,680
it's really about trying to reduce the
amount of food that we are responsible

939
00:38:50,681 --> 00:38:53,390
for.
That's also what I read in Dan Flores is

940
00:38:53,391 --> 00:38:58,300
book that the more we impact the coyotes
as far as like people trying to push

941
00:38:58,301 --> 00:39:03,301
them out and pressure them,
the more they produce extra babies like

942
00:39:03,311 --> 00:39:05,620
it.
Especially if they do that roll call

943
00:39:05,621 --> 00:39:07,600
thing when they scream out in the night
and you hear him,

944
00:39:07,601 --> 00:39:10,030
which is amazing.
That is one of my favorite things about

945
00:39:10,031 --> 00:39:10,864
coyotes,
man,

946
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,890
when I'm out at night and like,
you know,

947
00:39:12,891 --> 00:39:15,390
like you're sitting on the deck,
like having a cup of coffee or something

948
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,233
here.

949
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:18,910
You like,
wow,

950
00:39:18,911 --> 00:39:22,870
this is wild.
Like they are really out here like

951
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,880
grinding.
It makes you feel you're actually out in

952
00:39:24,881 --> 00:39:26,130
the wild a little bit.
Yeah,

953
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,360
a little bit.
Even though like you're sitting on your

954
00:39:28,361 --> 00:39:31,030
deck sound into music.
Exactly.

955
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,020
Tie it to going off.
Yeah.

956
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,710
Drinking a nice cup of coffee or
something.

957
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:36,340
It's just um,
it's just,

958
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:41,430
it's such a unique relationship that we
have with that one Predator where it's

959
00:39:41,711 --> 00:39:43,510
like,
I liked them around,

960
00:39:43,511 --> 00:39:46,900
like I would be really weird if that was
a,

961
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:49,450
you know,
any other kind of like scary Predator,

962
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:52,120
but coyotes are kind of cool to have
around.

963
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:53,410
Yeah.
Yeah.

964
00:39:53,411 --> 00:39:56,800
I mean definitely.
I think the same way a lot of people may

965
00:39:56,801 --> 00:39:59,110
not feel quite the same when they're
getting in their backyard,

966
00:39:59,111 --> 00:40:01,110
but I know.
Yeah,

967
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,100
I get that.
Yeah.

968
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:04,050
I do too,
I mean I'm,

969
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,770
I'm a dog lover,
I've got chickens,

970
00:40:05,771 --> 00:40:08,950
I've got all these things that coyotes
could effect me as well,

971
00:40:08,951 --> 00:40:12,070
but I also realize that there's things I
can do to make sure that they're not

972
00:40:12,071 --> 00:40:15,130
going to get to my chickens are,
they're knocking on my dogs.

973
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,410
Well,
I have a puppy right now and that's my,

974
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,440
my big fear is because I have a golden
retriever puppy and he is like golden

975
00:40:22,601 --> 00:40:24,680
retrievers under if you ever had one.
The early,

976
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:28,780
the most non dog dogs,
like they don't bark at anybody.

977
00:40:28,781 --> 00:40:32,320
They're terrible watchdogs.
They love everybody and they just have

978
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,530
zero killer instinct,
like zero.

979
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:39,640
They're just sweethearts and I'm just
worried that he's going to get jacked.

980
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:41,590
Yeah,
I mean I would definitely keep them

981
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:44,680
secure until it gets up to that 40,
50 pound range right there.

982
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,480
They're generally pretty safe.
Yeah.

983
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,720
So now they do sometimes ambush them
though,

984
00:40:49,721 --> 00:40:51,940
right?
It happens.

985
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:55,060
It's rare.
Usually most of the attacks are smaller

986
00:40:55,061 --> 00:40:55,900
dogs.
However,

987
00:40:55,901 --> 00:40:58,930
there are definitely cases where they've
gone even after something as big as your

988
00:40:58,931 --> 00:41:00,520
master,
if that's crazy.

989
00:41:00,521 --> 00:41:02,620
I mean,
it's pretty rare that happens.

990
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:05,260
Um,
the whole coyote dog things complicated.

991
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,990
I bet you if you googled dogs and
coyotes playing on Youtube,

992
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:12,820
you would find a dozen videos very
quickly because we've actually looked at

993
00:41:12,821 --> 00:41:15,760
some of that and it's just like that,
that relationship's not as simple as

994
00:41:15,761 --> 00:41:18,730
just like they're going to go after the
dogs know they play around together,

995
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,580
but then they'll kill them and eat them.
Just like,

996
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:24,370
what kind of relationship do we have,
man?

997
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:26,980
Yeah.
Well we don't know how often they

998
00:41:26,981 --> 00:41:29,230
actually eat them.
We think sometimes they just kill them

999
00:41:29,231 --> 00:41:31,750
and carry them off because that same
thing they do with foxes.

1000
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:32,561
Really?
Yeah.

1001
00:41:32,561 --> 00:41:34,970
So like gray and red foxes,
the coyotes will kill them,

1002
00:41:34,971 --> 00:41:37,220
but they generally don't eat them.
Which really when you started thinking

1003
00:41:37,221 --> 00:41:38,630
ecologically it makes sense,
right?

1004
00:41:38,631 --> 00:41:41,960
Like they're so related that there's
lots of diseases they could be

1005
00:41:41,961 --> 00:41:44,600
transmitted between them.
So it's kind of a risk.

1006
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,480
Any time you eat something that's very
closely related to you.

1007
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:48,830
Oh,
that's fascinating.

1008
00:41:48,831 --> 00:41:51,860
So essentially the same thing as like a
mad cow disease.

1009
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:54,740
Exactly.
Which has comes from the prions,

1010
00:41:54,741 --> 00:41:58,520
which is we feed cows,
cow material and then they get that.

1011
00:41:58,521 --> 00:41:59,990
What is it called?
Jacob's Krogh.

1012
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,850
Spelled disease.
That's right.

1013
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:04,970
Yeah.
Which is the same disease that they find

1014
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,090
in cannibals in.
Um,

1015
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:12,230
what is it,
what country is it that they find that

1016
00:42:12,231 --> 00:42:16,940
in Indonesia?
I forget where it is,

1017
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:21,350
but it's interesting and it's
essentially the same thing.

1018
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:22,370
Same.
Yeah.

1019
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:24,350
Yeah.
I mean anytime you start and that's just

1020
00:42:24,351 --> 00:42:26,090
one disease.
I mean there's lots of parasites and

1021
00:42:26,091 --> 00:42:30,380
stuff too that if you were,
they transferred between similarly

1022
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:34,430
related species much easier than it does
to say between a cat and a dog.

1023
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,000
Wow.
So I mean there's a lot of spillover and

1024
00:42:38,001 --> 00:42:41,360
zoonotic diseases between wildlife and
domestic animals.

1025
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:44,270
Luckily we have lots of vaccinations for
things that I'm sure you've heard of,

1026
00:42:44,271 --> 00:42:48,060
like Parvo and distemper,
and so there's,

1027
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:50,660
there's vaccinations we can give our
animals to take care of that.

1028
00:42:50,661 --> 00:42:52,610
Obviously these wild animals just have
to deal with it.

1029
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:54,350
You had distemper is very common,
right?

1030
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,460
I had a dog down.
Yeah.

1031
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,720
But in Parvos it's also deadly to
puppies.

1032
00:42:59,721 --> 00:43:01,160
Right?
They get that exactly.

1033
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:04,820
A Parvo is very common in this area.
We actually not just right down the

1034
00:43:04,821 --> 00:43:07,040
street here,
we lost some pups to Parvo.

1035
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:11,330
And is this something that's transmitted
through wildlife as well?

1036
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:16,720
It can be a so we're not exactly sure if
it's only wildlife to domestic,

1037
00:43:17,001 --> 00:43:19,400
it's probably both.
It's probably being moved between the

1038
00:43:19,401 --> 00:43:23,300
different populations.
So I mean luckily if we vaccinate well

1039
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:27,560
we can reduce that spread but people
have to be good about vaccinating their

1040
00:43:27,561 --> 00:43:28,100
animals.

1041
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:33,100
So do you guys have a mandate like when
it comes to studying a coyotes and when

1042
00:43:33,531 --> 00:43:36,980
it comes to dealing with them,
like what is the overall emphasis on,

1043
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:40,820
is it on just understanding their range
where they are or is it,

1044
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:45,140
do you try to do something with them?
So our role is to try to help protect

1045
00:43:45,141 --> 00:43:50,141
wildlife within national park areas.
And so what we try to do is we try to

1046
00:43:50,721 --> 00:43:54,380
get as most understanding we can so we
can help reduce conflicts,

1047
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:56,570
help reduce disease transmissions,
help,

1048
00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:00,710
just basically help the whole ecology of
these animals to make sure there's not

1049
00:44:00,711 --> 00:44:03,820
things coming into our populations that
are,

1050
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:07,130
are going to end up affecting them.
It's interesting because,

1051
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:10,400
you know,
think like when people start cutting

1052
00:44:10,401 --> 00:44:13,310
budgets and they start looking for like
a,

1053
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:15,350
well,
where can we reduce spending?

1054
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,810
Like there might be a few people that
come along and go,

1055
00:44:17,811 --> 00:44:19,010
hey,
why don't we give a shit about these

1056
00:44:19,011 --> 00:44:20,390
coyotes,
you know,

1057
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:21,440
does that,
does that come up?

1058
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:23,810
I mean,
that always comes up anytime budgets or

1059
00:44:23,811 --> 00:44:26,570
dealt with.
But for us,

1060
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:30,230
for an important thing for us is just to
make sure that we do everything we can

1061
00:44:30,231 --> 00:44:32,460
to protect our resources within our
park.

1062
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:35,310
And so we,
we have identified that this is a

1063
00:44:35,311 --> 00:44:39,330
potential risk for our local wildlife.
And so that's why we've started studying

1064
00:44:39,331 --> 00:44:40,950
the things like the mountain lions,
the bobcat's.

1065
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,890
So our park is completely surrounded by
urbanization.

1066
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:46,050
Um,
we have lots of influences.

1067
00:44:46,051 --> 00:44:50,940
I mean our mountains are about 50
percent of it is privately owned and so

1068
00:44:50,941 --> 00:44:52,650
there's a lot of chances for
development,

1069
00:44:52,651 --> 00:44:56,730
so it's important for us to understand
how development is affecting the

1070
00:44:56,731 --> 00:44:59,190
wildlife so we can help try to mitigate
that in the future.

1071
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,300
That's awesome.
Now when you are dealing with these

1072
00:45:03,301 --> 00:45:06,870
animals and you're collecting data and
information,

1073
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:11,670
do you guys share it with people that
maybe a other peers that you have that

1074
00:45:11,671 --> 00:45:15,600
work in much larger areas and do you
find like similar patterns and similar

1075
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:16,590
similar results?

1076
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,680
So we generally share it through
scientific publications is usually how

1077
00:45:19,681 --> 00:45:21,470
stuff is shared between us.
Um,

1078
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,730
that being said,
we definitely talked to other parks like

1079
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,500
it.
I just recently went there to help them

1080
00:45:25,501 --> 00:45:27,270
do some raccoons stuff.
Um,

1081
00:45:27,271 --> 00:45:29,910
and so we will definitely share
information to try to help deal with

1082
00:45:29,911 --> 00:45:34,230
similar issues.
And so I was up there for about three or

1083
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,030
four days and we talked about lots of
things,

1084
00:45:36,031 --> 00:45:39,230
but one things they've had with coyotes
is people feeding them out of the car.

1085
00:45:39,231 --> 00:45:42,480
So like people will drive through,
they'll take food because the coyotes

1086
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,640
hanging off nearby and they'll throw it
out the car to the coyote.

1087
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:48,240
The coyote got so habituated to that it
would just be coming up to every car and

1088
00:45:48,241 --> 00:45:51,030
start jumping up on cars low.
And so they're like,

1089
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:52,770
this is.
They ended up having to remove the

1090
00:45:52,771 --> 00:45:55,590
animal because all these people just
ended up feeding it.

1091
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:58,650
They would go up and scare the thing and
they would,

1092
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:00,810
I think they even tried,
I think they said they tried to paint

1093
00:46:00,811 --> 00:46:01,980
ball at,
um,

1094
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:06,600
but it ended up learning who they were.
Like they learned their cars that

1095
00:46:06,601 --> 00:46:08,520
learned who they were.
So every time they would come up the

1096
00:46:08,521 --> 00:46:10,320
kite,
it would disappear back into the bushes,

1097
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:14,410
even if they tried it in their own cars,
but it would still do it to their own

1098
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:16,120
cars.
The coyote recognize them now.

1099
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,390
Over time it ended up learning to
recognize the people.

1100
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,250
They're too smart.
They are.

1101
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:22,690
Wow.
That's so interesting now.

1102
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:26,010
And I definitely noticed that even with
trapping and stuff and we're trying to

1103
00:46:26,011 --> 00:46:27,840
capture these animals,
I feel like there's times when they

1104
00:46:27,841 --> 00:46:31,020
definitely kind of avoid the area
because some of these animals had been

1105
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:34,500
on the air for years and so we,
we try to capture them as many times as

1106
00:46:34,501 --> 00:46:35,550
we can to keep them on there.

1107
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:38,310
So our callers only generally last
somewhere between a year and three years

1108
00:46:38,311 --> 00:46:39,720
depending on what kind of color we put
on them.

1109
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,360
And so a lot of times we want to keep
them on long term so we actually

1110
00:46:42,361 --> 00:46:44,700
understand the whole life cycle,
what's going on.

1111
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:47,190
Um,
and so we'll go in and try to capture

1112
00:46:47,191 --> 00:46:48,670
them again,
but they're there.

1113
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:50,820
They're smart,
they kind of learned to avoid once I

1114
00:46:50,821 --> 00:46:52,830
start going into an area,
well coordinated.

1115
00:46:52,831 --> 00:46:57,831
Dan is a big part of their cleverness.
And also their adaptability comes from

1116
00:46:57,841 --> 00:47:02,340
them being preyed upon by gray wolves
and their relationship with gray wolves

1117
00:47:02,341 --> 00:47:05,400
and gray wolves had left and then come
back to North America.

1118
00:47:05,401 --> 00:47:07,770
And in the meantime,
coyotes kind of thrived.

1119
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:11,220
And when they came back,
there was a period of thousands of years

1120
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:13,710
of them being preyed upon by these gray
wolves.

1121
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:17,910
So they've adapted all these different
sorts of mechanisms in order to stay

1122
00:47:17,911 --> 00:47:21,180
alive and to avoid predation.

1123
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,850
And one of them being that they expand
their range.

1124
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:27,990
So as we've tried to kill them,
one of the things that Dan was saying is

1125
00:47:27,991 --> 00:47:31,720
that when they do that roll thing,
if someone's missing the female will

1126
00:47:31,721 --> 00:47:35,500
actually have larger litters and then
they'll expand the range.

1127
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:37,890
So when you shoot one you think like,
Whoa,

1128
00:47:37,891 --> 00:47:39,790
we're keeping the coyote population
down.

1129
00:47:39,791 --> 00:47:42,310
No,
you'd probably raised it up by like 10,

1130
00:47:42,311 --> 00:47:45,700
15 percent and expanded the range by a
few miles.

1131
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:47,650
Yeah.
I don't know if it's just based off the

1132
00:47:47,651 --> 00:47:50,380
calling.
I've heard that before and there's some

1133
00:47:50,381 --> 00:47:52,600
dispute about whether that's the full
case or not,

1134
00:47:52,601 --> 00:47:54,370
but definitely because there's lower
numbers,

1135
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:57,610
there's definitely more food resources
available and so it makes sense that

1136
00:47:57,611 --> 00:48:00,070
they would read then reproduce more
because we definitely know if food

1137
00:48:00,071 --> 00:48:02,350
resources go up,
coyotes can increase their numbers.

1138
00:48:02,351 --> 00:48:02,891
So.
Oh,

1139
00:48:02,891 --> 00:48:06,190
that's interesting because he was saying
that it's a direct result of them being

1140
00:48:06,191 --> 00:48:06,990
preyed upon you.

1141
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:09,340
Do you think that's probably in dispute?
Well,

1142
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:12,980
the preyed upon hot or killed or you
know,

1143
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:15,340
removed,
I mean truthfully doesn't matter how the

1144
00:48:15,341 --> 00:48:17,950
animals,
how the population decreases and the

1145
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:22,150
fact is that it's down.
So then pray numbers go up and so then

1146
00:48:22,151 --> 00:48:26,410
there's more prey and so then they
reproduce more because Dan was implying

1147
00:48:26,411 --> 00:48:30,070
there's a direct correlation between,
there's a physiological event that

1148
00:48:30,071 --> 00:48:34,870
happens inside the female that when the
population grows smaller,

1149
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:39,010
their litters grow larger in response to
the population being smaller,

1150
00:48:39,011 --> 00:48:41,770
not necessarily in response to the
increase of food supply.

1151
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:43,720
Um,
as far as I know,

1152
00:48:43,721 --> 00:48:46,480
the only things I've read,
it's usually Dave associated somehow

1153
00:48:46,481 --> 00:48:48,640
with food supply.
So it was probably,

1154
00:48:48,641 --> 00:48:51,370
maybe a combination of those factors are
very well could be.

1155
00:48:51,371 --> 00:48:52,300
I mean,
it's complicated,

1156
00:48:52,301 --> 00:48:55,090
right?
These are crazy with what they can do.

1157
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:59,320
It is absolutely fascinating how
adaptable they are though.

1158
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:02,080
Is there anything like them?
Um,

1159
00:49:02,081 --> 00:49:03,970
I mean when you start thinking of things
like crows,

1160
00:49:03,971 --> 00:49:07,390
they can be pretty adaptable to.
They can live in a wide variety of areas

1161
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,150
that through three d space they moved to
the air.

1162
00:49:10,151 --> 00:49:12,160
That's a different sort of bargain.
Yeah,

1163
00:49:12,161 --> 00:49:13,240
no,
I mean the coyotes,

1164
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,870
they definitely,
there's not any of has pieces the move

1165
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:20,140
around the country,
like they have a very able to live in

1166
00:49:20,141 --> 00:49:21,910
the most urban environments we can
imagine.

1167
00:49:21,911 --> 00:49:24,820
I mean places that people generally
think of maybe raccoon and be able to

1168
00:49:24,821 --> 00:49:27,100
live.
I know in Chicago they've gone into

1169
00:49:27,101 --> 00:49:30,370
areas where they have coyotes living and
they did not have raccoons living in

1170
00:49:30,371 --> 00:49:34,150
those same locations or if there were,
they were recommends were very rare and

1171
00:49:34,151 --> 00:49:35,680
you,
the coyote seen to be able to persist,

1172
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:37,720
which is amazing for an animal that
size.

1173
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:39,730
Um,
it just shows how intelligent they are

1174
00:49:39,731 --> 00:49:42,310
to be able to move around us and be able
to take advantage of us.

1175
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,470
Is it because they've,
they've run faster,

1176
00:49:44,471 --> 00:49:46,570
they're just,
it's probably a combination of things.

1177
00:49:46,571 --> 00:49:47,980
They learn how to deal with roads.
I mean,

1178
00:49:47,981 --> 00:49:49,330
anytime you get these urban
environments,

1179
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:52,240
like one thing I always like to say,
so like the West Lake neighborhood,

1180
00:49:52,241 --> 00:49:55,150
it's one of the most dangerous
neighborhoods for pedestrians.

1181
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:59,080
Yet this coyotes running this
neighborhood all the time and it didn't

1182
00:49:59,081 --> 00:50:01,000
have any signs of ever been struck by a
car.

1183
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:04,330
Do you think the smartest coyote is
smarter than the dumbest person?

1184
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:06,010
Yeah.
Whoa,

1185
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:07,593
that's deep.

1186
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:12,860
Deep.
Yeah.

1187
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,130
I mean they live in places that I don't
know if I could live there.

1188
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:18,490
Wow.
So now what city has,

1189
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:21,790
is there any city in the country that
actually has a legitimate problem with

1190
00:50:21,791 --> 00:50:23,970
coyote?
Depends who you talk to.

1191
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,030
I mean,
La,

1192
00:50:25,031 --> 00:50:28,010
we definitely have our issues.
I mean been bites.

1193
00:50:28,011 --> 00:50:30,410
There's been other situations been
bitten.

1194
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:31,230
Yeah.
Yeah.

1195
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:35,270
Elysian park had some bites.
There's bites down in Orange County or

1196
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:37,780
mine had some bites.
Are they biting homeless people?

1197
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:39,260
Are they biting people?
Take naps.

1198
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,020
What are the.
It's all over the board usually it seems

1199
00:50:42,021 --> 00:50:45,500
to be tied to people been feeding it and
so it's almost coming up and biting like

1200
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:47,510
people on the hands or people on the
leg.

1201
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:49,670
Um,
I don't think any of them know.

1202
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,040
The ones I've heard had been like,
where they're trying to take the person

1203
00:50:52,041 --> 00:50:53,840
down real type thing.

1204
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,570
They've all been more like where they're
coming up and none of them,

1205
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:58,040
none of them have.
Yes.

1206
00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:01,790
Do you heard about the woman who was a
folk singer in Canada that got killed a

1207
00:51:01,791 --> 00:51:03,350
couple of years back by coyotes?
Yeah.

1208
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:05,840
I actually went up there a couple of
years after that.

1209
00:51:05,841 --> 00:51:07,850
They actually got a study going on,
coyotes up there.

1210
00:51:07,851 --> 00:51:10,820
They radio collared a bunch and I went
up there and helped him capture the

1211
00:51:10,821 --> 00:51:12,800
first couple of animals to kind of see
what's going on.

1212
00:51:12,801 --> 00:51:14,630
And that's just a crazy scenario up
there.

1213
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,400
It's way different than what we see down
here.

1214
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:18,280
The coyotes first or there,
eastern coyotes,

1215
00:51:18,281 --> 00:51:21,230
so they're a little bit bigger,
but they're also,

1216
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:23,930
they kind of,
there's very few food sources up there.

1217
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:27,050
They're dealing with snowshoe hares,
which their cycles kind of fluctuate up

1218
00:51:27,051 --> 00:51:29,210
and down.
And so sometimes there could be tons of

1219
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:30,740
food and other times there can be almost
none,

1220
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:34,070
but they've learned that they can take
advantage of Moose during the winter and

1221
00:51:34,071 --> 00:51:36,650
they're actually killing Moose in the
snow,

1222
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:40,220
which you think of this little 40 inch
pound animal.

1223
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:42,740
Take it on this huge Moose.
But they're seeing it.

1224
00:51:42,741 --> 00:51:46,460
They do these snow surveys and they're
finding these dead moose that were very

1225
00:51:46,461 --> 00:51:48,440
clearly killed by coyotes.
Wow.

1226
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:50,440
So a full grown moose.
Yeah.

1227
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,290
That's insane.
Yeah.

1228
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:55,190
A full grown moose is like more than a
thousand pounds.

1229
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,000
Yeah.
Yeah.

1230
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:56,420
No,
it's,

1231
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:57,350
it's amazing.
I mean,

1232
00:51:57,351 --> 00:52:00,620
obviously these moose in the winter,
the snow gets deep right there.

1233
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:03,650
They're definitely.
They can get stuck in things.

1234
00:52:03,651 --> 00:52:06,290
And that type of scenario.
How do they know that it's coyotes have

1235
00:52:06,291 --> 00:52:08,630
killed him in a wolves.
There's no wolves there.

1236
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,930
Wow.
That's crazy.

1237
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:14,510
Yeah.
I did not know that a coyote could kill

1238
00:52:14,511 --> 00:52:17,030
a fucking moose will.
And they had them radio collared.

1239
00:52:17,031 --> 00:52:19,880
So they were able to see the coyotes at
the carcasses and stuff too.

1240
00:52:20,090 --> 00:52:22,370
Wow.
So when they have the radio collar,

1241
00:52:22,371 --> 00:52:25,610
how much information are they getting?
Do they get like a full,

1242
00:52:25,611 --> 00:52:28,370
like if you could see a map,
would you see like the trail,

1243
00:52:28,371 --> 00:52:29,330
like everywhere they go?

1244
00:52:29,590 --> 00:52:30,740
Um,
it depends.

1245
00:52:30,741 --> 00:52:33,260
So the colors have different settings,
so their gps units,

1246
00:52:33,261 --> 00:52:37,940
so there's always a trade off between
battery life and the number of locations

1247
00:52:37,941 --> 00:52:39,950
you can get.
So you could,

1248
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:43,550
if you only cared about a two week span,
you could have that GPS unit take a

1249
00:52:43,551 --> 00:52:47,930
location every 30 seconds and you can
map it out.

1250
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:51,200
But generally we're interested in a
broader timeframe.

1251
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:53,210
So a lot of times we're getting.
So like the Lions,

1252
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:55,940
a lot of times it's about eight
locations a day and that's a pretty good

1253
00:52:55,941 --> 00:53:00,941
size color on the coyotes.
I usually do somewhere around six and

1254
00:53:01,101 --> 00:53:04,370
then I'll do these little bouts where
I'll do 20 minute locations a day and so

1255
00:53:04,371 --> 00:53:07,670
then I'll get more intensity to,
and then I can map out like where they

1256
00:53:07,671 --> 00:53:10,790
come up to roads or where they do
different things where they're feeding.

1257
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:12,051
Um,
so yeah,

1258
00:53:12,051 --> 00:53:14,630
you can get some pretty detailed data on
how they're moving.

1259
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:19,040
So what kind of a battery source are you
using on these colors that you can get

1260
00:53:19,041 --> 00:53:21,380
such a long,
like how long does it like if you

1261
00:53:21,381 --> 00:53:23,570
stretch it out the longest,
how long can they last?

1262
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:27,240
So there's different sides of the
collars and so like the lion callers

1263
00:53:27,241 --> 00:53:30,090
are,
they can be two d cell batteries in them

1264
00:53:30,091 --> 00:53:32,780
which are just Lithium d cell batteries.
Um,

1265
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,760
and those go about two years with a two
D cell battery.

1266
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:36,860
Wow.
Um,

1267
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:41,340
you can put them on tiny little things.
I mean people have done not what gp s

1268
00:53:41,341 --> 00:53:41,941
yet,
I don't believe,

1269
00:53:41,941 --> 00:53:44,100
but they've even done like little bugs
where they've put the.

1270
00:53:44,330 --> 00:53:46,980
So the colors have to different things.
They have a gps and they have a vhf

1271
00:53:46,981 --> 00:53:48,810
function.
The vhf allows us to actually go out and

1272
00:53:48,811 --> 00:53:49,500
track the animals.

1273
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,900
So when you see the biologists out there
with those antanas,

1274
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,120
so you literally know where they are.
They are.

1275
00:53:54,121 --> 00:53:55,470
Yeah.
So that's how like all of these

1276
00:53:55,471 --> 00:53:57,660
observations I've talked about,
that's how I see them.

1277
00:53:57,661 --> 00:54:00,390
It's because they have that little
beacon that goes off in a color and so I

1278
00:54:00,391 --> 00:54:04,020
can track them with that antenna and see
where they are and get pretty close to

1279
00:54:04,021 --> 00:54:04,980
them and see them,
what they're doing.

1280
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:06,200
That's incredible.
So the,

1281
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:08,070
the,
they literally the last two years with

1282
00:54:08,071 --> 00:54:09,460
two D cell batteries.
Yep.

1283
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:13,870
And then when the two years are up that
you don't know where he is exactly the

1284
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,750
well,
what's amazing about the lions is that

1285
00:54:15,751 --> 00:54:18,300
we can recapture them.
We have really good success rate getting

1286
00:54:18,301 --> 00:54:20,280
those guys back.
And so jeff's been amazing.

1287
00:54:20,281 --> 00:54:23,010
I mean he's been able to get these
animals time after time after time.

1288
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:25,890
And that's why like a p 22 has been
captured so many times because we have

1289
00:54:25,891 --> 00:54:28,930
to replace the collar.
So it's usually about every two years we

1290
00:54:28,931 --> 00:54:30,970
had to replace the collar.
So it.

1291
00:54:30,971 --> 00:54:33,870
So how are they tracking that cat?
Um,

1292
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:37,140
I mean there,
we've done multiple things.

1293
00:54:37,141 --> 00:54:40,590
We've gotten lucky one time and he was
actually down in a hole and me and jeff

1294
00:54:40,591 --> 00:54:43,800
were actually there and we darted the
thing and it just fell asleep in the

1295
00:54:43,801 --> 00:54:45,510
hole,
which was pretty sweet.

1296
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:48,360
So you saw in a whole like a hole in the
ground.

1297
00:54:48,361 --> 00:54:51,930
It was kind of a,
a drainage channel was kind of eroded

1298
00:54:51,931 --> 00:54:55,170
away and he was kind of down in this and
there's a bunch of brush covering it and

1299
00:54:55,171 --> 00:54:59,640
so he felt pretty comfortable I guess
and he just stayed there and so we were

1300
00:54:59,641 --> 00:55:03,660
hiking into don't know if we were
looking for a kill or if we were just

1301
00:55:03,661 --> 00:55:04,200
checking on him.

1302
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,910
I can't remember what we were doing but
whatever.

1303
00:55:05,911 --> 00:55:08,940
We saw him and so we're like,
well let's try to Darden.

1304
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:12,810
And so I stood there and waited for jeff
to go get the stuff and jeff was able to

1305
00:55:12,811 --> 00:55:16,280
darden when he came back and the cat
just laid there like we put a dart in

1306
00:55:16,281 --> 00:55:17,190
him.
He growled out us.

1307
00:55:17,191 --> 00:55:20,670
He laid back down and fell asleep and we
were able to process them.

1308
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:22,520
How crazy is that when a cat growls at
you?

1309
00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:24,720
Uh,
it was actually pretty freaking cool

1310
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,810
guys.
It's pretty amazing being that close to

1311
00:55:28,811 --> 00:55:31,270
such a big animal.
Just how far away were you?

1312
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:34,210
Probably from me to your wall.
Oh No,

1313
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:36,730
really?
Oh my gosh.

1314
00:55:36,731 --> 00:55:38,350
It's so pretty.
Oh my God.

1315
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:43,240
Do you have a backup gun or a Taser or.
We carry person America Shield.

1316
00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:47,350
Get them out there in the captain
America Shield.

1317
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:48,183
Come on.
Gotcha.

1318
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:51,430
I would think that would actually be a
good move for a cap.

1319
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:55,110
Right?
Like a big Ole like gladiator shield.

1320
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:59,500
I'd probably be confused.
They'd tried to Jack you run into the

1321
00:55:59,501 --> 00:56:00,700
shield.
Where is he?

1322
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:01,631
Nice.
Yeah.

1323
00:56:01,631 --> 00:56:03,220
I don't think I want to carry that
through the brush though.

1324
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,730
Good point.
No,

1325
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:07,480
we,
we do carry bear spray.

1326
00:56:07,810 --> 00:56:09,610
Does that work?
I mean we haven't had to use it.

1327
00:56:09,611 --> 00:56:12,310
So retail,
you just use it once and tell me.

1328
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,060
Because I was thinking like I run
through the hills.

1329
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,120
I was thinking,
you know,

1330
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:18,880
I do.
This is an area where I run where it's

1331
00:56:18,881 --> 00:56:21,350
really desolate.
There's no one out there and I know this

1332
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,980
bobcat's there,
um,

1333
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:27,670
but I also now know that there's a mount
line there because a buddy of mine saw a

1334
00:56:27,671 --> 00:56:32,671
mountain lion there and it had a collar
and then he heard about a mountain lion

1335
00:56:33,011 --> 00:56:38,011
that got killed on the five freeway and
he checked a website.

1336
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,810
Is there a website that shows you that
track,

1337
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,670
like,
were where the animal has been?

1338
00:56:43,050 --> 00:56:45,400
Um,
there are that we can see.

1339
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:48,400
We don't share that with other people,
but I wonder how he found out he,

1340
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:51,210
he knows a lot of people.
Maybe he asked somebody but,

1341
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:55,120
but found out that it was the,
the was the mountain lion that he saw in

1342
00:56:55,121 --> 00:56:57,250
his neighborhood and he lives pretty
close to the five.

1343
00:56:57,370 --> 00:56:58,570
Okay.
And so,

1344
00:56:58,571 --> 00:56:59,231
uh,
he was,

1345
00:56:59,231 --> 00:57:00,340
uh,
explaining that,

1346
00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:01,420
you know,
like he saw it.

1347
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:01,930
Yeah.
I mean,

1348
00:57:01,930 --> 00:57:03,760
we don't have any cats that are up there
near the five.

1349
00:57:03,761 --> 00:57:07,000
So probably he could have probably just
looked at that map that you guys put up

1350
00:57:07,001 --> 00:57:08,620
there.
Even it could have easily been one of

1351
00:57:08,621 --> 00:57:12,400
those because there's just not many up
in that area that we have collared,

1352
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,050
but they do occasionally get hit by
cars.

1353
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:14,681
Right?
Yeah.

1354
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:16,450
That's actually one of our biggest
causes.

1355
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:18,640
Mortality these days is them getting hit
by cars.

1356
00:57:18,641 --> 00:57:20,920
So we,
we work a lot with Caltrans to try to

1357
00:57:20,921 --> 00:57:24,880
improve permeability of the roadways for
wildlife and protect them from being hit

1358
00:57:24,881 --> 00:57:27,400
by cars.
I know there was a ramp that was being

1359
00:57:27,401 --> 00:57:30,820
proposed that they were going to put a
ramp over the highway.

1360
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:31,211
Right.
Oh,

1361
00:57:31,211 --> 00:57:35,020
here it is.
Caltrans proposes wildlife overpass on

1362
00:57:35,021 --> 00:57:36,340
the freeway.
Now where were they?

1363
00:57:36,350 --> 00:57:39,160
Kind of try to put that.
So this is supposed to be near Liberty

1364
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:39,760
Canyon.
This is,

1365
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,410
where's Liberty Kenyon?
Um,

1366
00:57:41,411 --> 00:57:45,910
it's just a little bit west of here near
a Gora Oh,

1367
00:57:45,911 --> 00:57:46,790
okay.
Um,

1368
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:48,460
yeah,
so this,

1369
00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:50,860
this overpass,
it will be big from outlines,

1370
00:57:50,861 --> 00:57:53,110
but also lots of other wildlife in our
mountains.

1371
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:58,450
So we have seen that the 101 freeway is
a major barrier to gene flow.

1372
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:00,130
And so things like,
even coyotes,

1373
00:58:00,131 --> 00:58:02,470
even though they are able to live in
this super urban environment,

1374
00:58:02,590 --> 00:58:03,490
not one,
oh one.

1375
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:06,520
And the development along one-on-one is
serving as a barrier that they're not

1376
00:58:06,521 --> 00:58:10,420
getting across regularly enough to keep
the population genetics up.

1377
00:58:10,421 --> 00:58:14,110
So genetic diversity south of the
freeway is a lot lower than genetic

1378
00:58:14,111 --> 00:58:15,590
diversity north to the freeway.
Right.

1379
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:18,250
Right.
Now for Bobcats,

1380
00:58:18,251 --> 00:58:22,220
mountain lions and coyotes.
I have a friend who works at the tone

1381
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:23,890
ranch.
Do you know where that is?

1382
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:24,920
Yeah.
I have a buddy that works there too.

1383
00:58:24,921 --> 00:58:26,680
Oh yeah.
I was actually just there this weekend

1384
00:58:26,890 --> 00:58:30,730
and they were explaining to me that they
had a camera trap on one of the

1385
00:58:30,731 --> 00:58:34,150
waterholes and they saw 16 different
mountain lions.

1386
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,660
Wow.
They've got 16 photos of 16 different

1387
00:58:37,661 --> 00:58:39,370
cats that are on there.
A huge ranch,

1388
00:58:39,371 --> 00:58:41,740
270,000 acres.
It's enormous ranch.

1389
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:42,760
Yeah.
Yeah.

1390
00:58:42,761 --> 00:58:43,360
I,
um,

1391
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:45,970
I don't know how they could identify
each individual lion.

1392
00:58:45,971 --> 00:58:48,460
That's my first question is how to do
individual.

1393
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:50,120
Um,
but yeah,

1394
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:52,000
the mountain lions,
they can be quite a few of them.

1395
00:58:52,001 --> 00:58:53,200
I mean,
a lot of times with mountain lions will

1396
00:58:53,201 --> 00:58:55,180
come back obviously with,
especially with something like a water

1397
00:58:55,181 --> 00:58:56,740
source there.
Um,

1398
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,870
so I would,
I would question whether it was

1399
00:58:58,871 --> 00:59:00,220
different or not,
but yeah,

1400
00:59:00,221 --> 00:59:01,500
I mean it's a place like the hone.
I mean,

1401
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:02,201
it's amazing,
right?

1402
00:59:02,201 --> 00:59:07,201
There's lots of different prey animals.
They're from elk to deer to a special

1403
00:59:08,021 --> 00:59:08,920
place.
It is,

1404
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:11,920
it's really crazy.
Just mean everything.

1405
00:59:11,950 --> 00:59:13,660
The wildlife,
the flowers,

1406
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,150
the pigs,
like it's just a crazy,

1407
00:59:16,151 --> 00:59:17,530
crazy place.
It is.

1408
00:59:17,531 --> 00:59:18,780
So many pigs there.
It's,

1409
00:59:18,810 --> 00:59:23,270
it's a nutty farm,
nutty ranch and it's so large.

1410
00:59:23,271 --> 00:59:25,820
It's just amazing.
Like my buddy's like cowboy up there and

1411
00:59:25,821 --> 00:59:28,170
so he took me for a tour to kind of see
the ranch and it's,

1412
00:59:28,171 --> 00:59:29,070
it's amazing.
Yeah.

1413
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:31,940
Well it's the biggest ranch in
California,

1414
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:33,770
270,000 acres.

1415
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:36,230
It's almost hard to wrap your head
around how big it is,

1416
00:59:36,231 --> 00:59:38,810
but when you're there and you go,
how far does it go?

1417
00:59:38,811 --> 00:59:40,670
And then you go see that third mountain
range.

1418
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:41,570
We go to that.
You're like,

1419
00:59:41,571 --> 00:59:42,404
what?
Yeah,

1420
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,560
over to the desert over.
Yeah,

1421
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:47,900
it's everywhere.
And then the water for Los Angeles goes

1422
00:59:47,901 --> 00:59:50,450
through it.
If you see that gigantic water pipe that

1423
00:59:50,451 --> 00:59:51,440
goes through the,
uh,

1424
00:59:51,510 --> 00:59:52,740
your iphone ranch.
Yeah.

1425
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:53,541
Yeah.
And you go,

1426
00:59:53,541 --> 00:59:55,220
what?
That's where all the water goes.

1427
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:57,440
It goes through this thing.
It's just,

1428
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,420
it's just crazy.
That's amazing.

1429
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:00,830
Yeah.
Well,

1430
01:00:00,831 --> 01:00:04,520
it's weird that we have a place that's
an hour and a half outside of La that

1431
01:00:04,521 --> 01:00:06,860
has elk.
I know this like,

1432
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:08,700
we're so lucky.
Like it's,

1433
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:11,600
it's just such a unique spot a lot of
ways.

1434
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:12,231
Yeah.
It's amazing.

1435
01:00:12,231 --> 01:00:13,940
I mean,
used to be tons of elk here,

1436
01:00:13,941 --> 01:00:15,360
right?
Like all the Tuli elk,

1437
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:19,940
they used to cover the whole area at the
stories of Tulio pick out in the San

1438
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:19,940
Joaquin Valley.

1439
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:23,150
They're just amazing numbers of elk.
So yeah,

1440
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:25,570
we'll also.
Grizzly bears and grizzlies.

1441
01:00:25,571 --> 01:00:26,404
Yeah,
that's,

1442
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:28,190
there's a,
uh,

1443
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:33,191
there's a town up near to home that's
named after the last guy that got killed

1444
01:00:33,261 --> 01:00:36,680
by a grizzly bear in California before
they wiped them out.

1445
01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:39,110
God,
I'm trying to remember.

1446
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:43,020
I'm trying to remember the town's name,
dammit.

1447
01:00:43,910 --> 01:00:45,320
But the,
uh,

1448
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:49,670
it's been confirmed that he was killed.
They actually exude his body and found

1449
01:00:49,671 --> 01:00:53,680
it broken up into pieces and one of his
legs was chewed off like,

1450
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:55,840
wow,
like you really did get jacked by a

1451
01:00:55,841 --> 01:00:58,850
grizzly bear.
Apparently we had enormous coastal bears

1452
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:02,000
and that's why they wiped them out.
It was just like when the settlers came

1453
01:01:02,001 --> 01:01:02,481
here,
they were like,

1454
01:01:02,481 --> 01:01:03,620
okay,
fuck this.

1455
01:01:03,850 --> 01:01:06,440
We've got to kill these goddamn things
because they were like,

1456
01:01:06,470 --> 01:01:09,350
you know,
Kodiak sized enormous bears,

1457
01:01:09,490 --> 01:01:12,380
but obviously they did a good job since
we don't have a single grizzly left in

1458
01:01:12,381 --> 01:01:12,980
California.

1459
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:14,060
Yeah.
That's one animal.

1460
01:01:14,061 --> 01:01:14,960
Lubeck.
Thank you.

1461
01:01:14,970 --> 01:01:16,460
Jamie Beck.
That's,

1462
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:20,450
that's one animal where people are not
clamoring for reintroduction.

1463
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:21,381
Yeah.
You know,

1464
01:01:21,381 --> 01:01:23,690
like let's truthfully,
there's no area left for them,

1465
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:26,390
like the area that grizzlies occurred.
We've developed,

1466
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:30,050
turned in agriculture and urbanization.
So bringing grizzlies back.

1467
01:01:30,051 --> 01:01:31,310
I mean,
you hear it every once in a while

1468
01:01:31,311 --> 01:01:32,500
somebody say that,
but I'm like,

1469
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:38,380
they're too big and they need too much
food and too much of that food is living

1470
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:42,070
animals and that would be a problem.
Well,

1471
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:43,460
even if that's.
I mean,

1472
01:01:43,550 --> 01:01:45,020
even all that,
if there is no habitat,

1473
01:01:45,021 --> 01:01:46,700
where did you put on?
Like they're not sure they're not going

1474
01:01:46,701 --> 01:01:48,890
to live up in the high mountains.
That's what we have.

1475
01:01:48,891 --> 01:01:51,510
Say That's what we have protected is the
Sierras and those types of things.

1476
01:01:51,511 --> 01:01:54,830
That's not grizzly habitat.
So when we do have quite a bit of black

1477
01:01:54,831 --> 01:01:55,550
bears,
right?

1478
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:57,080
We do,
but they can live up in the mountain.

1479
01:01:57,470 --> 01:01:59,570
They do much better in that scenario.
Yeah.

1480
01:01:59,571 --> 01:02:04,070
It's really fascinating to me how the
whole thing is sort of like a,

1481
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:09,470
a balanced system and they all sort of
keep each other in check.

1482
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:11,600
You know,
California is a good example of that

1483
01:02:11,601 --> 01:02:16,130
because it's one of the few states that
has a large healthy mountain lion

1484
01:02:16,131 --> 01:02:18,560
population,
but they don't allow hunting of mountain

1485
01:02:18,561 --> 01:02:21,810
lions.
So because of that you have less dear

1486
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:23,820
but.
And people will complain about that

1487
01:02:23,821 --> 01:02:25,680
hunters,
but also because of that you have less

1488
01:02:25,681 --> 01:02:27,100
car accidents with deer.
Yeah.

1489
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:29,910
Like if you live in like A.
I have a buddy lives in Iowa.

1490
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:33,510
You have to drive slow because the
fucking deer just jumping out in front

1491
01:02:33,511 --> 01:02:35,880
of the road every 50 to 100 yards.
I mean,

1492
01:02:35,881 --> 01:02:38,160
it's crazy how many,
especially during the Rut when they're

1493
01:02:38,161 --> 01:02:39,690
breeding and they get silly.

1494
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:44,040
See just dead deer every couple miles.
He had dead deer on the side of the

1495
01:02:44,041 --> 01:02:44,780
road.
Yeah,

1496
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:47,280
I mean we're a lot different obviously
than the midwest like you're talking

1497
01:02:47,281 --> 01:02:49,290
about too.
We got a lot less vegetation or a lot

1498
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:51,900
more lawless rains.
We have a lot less of that good quality

1499
01:02:51,901 --> 01:02:54,330
vegetation for the deer.
So our deer numbers are also going to be

1500
01:02:54,331 --> 01:02:58,740
in check partially just because we don't
have the highest quality habitat for

1501
01:02:58,741 --> 01:03:01,230
deer and most of our areas is what,
what are they?

1502
01:03:01,231 --> 01:03:02,640
Just eating grass and stuff,
right?

1503
01:03:02,641 --> 01:03:03,780
Like what are they either date?
A lot of.

1504
01:03:03,781 --> 01:03:05,590
Browse,
a lot of brush sage,

1505
01:03:05,591 --> 01:03:06,120
right?
These,

1506
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:08,220
a lot of sage.
They can definitely eat sage.

1507
01:03:08,490 --> 01:03:12,020
There's a lot of like deer brush and
just lots of variety of types of broaden

1508
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:14,340
and you walk through there.
There's tons of different varieties that

1509
01:03:14,341 --> 01:03:15,040
they eat.

1510
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:17,130
Um,
we actually have a couple of deer radio

1511
01:03:17,131 --> 01:03:18,900
collared right now that we're following
and they're,

1512
01:03:18,901 --> 01:03:21,930
they're always browsing on something
when I see them usually something

1513
01:03:21,931 --> 01:03:23,880
taller.
And how do you capture them?

1514
01:03:24,410 --> 01:03:26,520
We dart them.
So you do,

1515
01:03:26,910 --> 01:03:28,590
do you set,
do you trap them?

1516
01:03:28,591 --> 01:03:30,510
And then Darden,
like we freed artem.

1517
01:03:30,870 --> 01:03:31,950
Okay.
So how do you do that?

1518
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:34,920
Um,
you basically just try to find where

1519
01:03:34,921 --> 01:03:37,930
they're at and he's basically hunting
basically hunting with a rifle.

1520
01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:41,670
So it's a lot like archery basically.
I mean we're ringing just to be like

1521
01:03:41,671 --> 01:03:42,540
really short,
right?

1522
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:44,940
Yeah.
So somebody really good with the dart

1523
01:03:44,941 --> 01:03:47,490
rifle and probably get up to 70 meters
or so.

1524
01:03:47,550 --> 01:03:49,640
Oh really?
I'm not that person.

1525
01:03:49,690 --> 01:03:52,710
I'm about 30 meters with mine.
How many deer have you darted?

1526
01:03:52,770 --> 01:03:54,450
I've only started to here.
Um,

1527
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:56,820
but we're hoping that we still have four
more we need to do.

1528
01:03:57,180 --> 01:03:59,540
So is it an air rifle?
Uh,

1529
01:03:59,550 --> 01:04:01,890
so there's two different types.
There's one that's basically powered off

1530
01:04:01,891 --> 01:04:05,340
of a 22 shell.
Then there's another one that's powered

1531
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:06,810
off CEO to.
Hmm.

1532
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:10,860
And so do you practice with this thing?
How do you get good at it?

1533
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:11,651
Yeah,
you practiced.

1534
01:04:11,651 --> 01:04:12,630
I mean it's,
it's like a rifle.

1535
01:04:12,631 --> 01:04:14,370
You got a scope and all that so you can
kind of,

1536
01:04:14,371 --> 01:04:17,400
you get it all it in,
but the ballistics must be terrible.

1537
01:04:17,430 --> 01:04:20,130
Oh they're bad.
And it's even more complicated because

1538
01:04:20,131 --> 01:04:23,190
you want it to arch really lightly.
You want to hit the end of the soft as

1539
01:04:23,191 --> 01:04:26,130
possible because if you hit them hard,
they're going to run and the drug,

1540
01:04:26,131 --> 01:04:27,900
it's not like the drug takes them down
immediately.

1541
01:04:27,901 --> 01:04:30,330
We usually have about 10 minutes for the
animal to go down and.

1542
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:31,800
Oh Jesus,
you'll never find them.

1543
01:04:31,801 --> 01:04:32,634
Exactly.

1544
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:36,570
So it's really about like arching that
shot in there really softly hit them as

1545
01:04:36,571 --> 01:04:39,210
soft as possible and then lot of times
they don't go very far.

1546
01:04:39,690 --> 01:04:42,810
Wow.
So like what's the feet per second of

1547
01:04:42,811 --> 01:04:43,850
the dark?
Oh,

1548
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:44,880
I don't know.
We haven't,

1549
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:48,420
we don't have the chronology or you
don't have a radar thing that you shoot

1550
01:04:48,421 --> 01:04:50,010
it through and we don't want to borrow
mine.

1551
01:04:50,130 --> 01:04:51,170
Sure.
Yeah.

1552
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:53,190
I want to know.
Yeah,

1553
01:04:53,191 --> 01:04:54,660
because I think that's interesting.
Like what?

1554
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:59,040
Like [inaudible] you must have like the
the drop must be huge.

1555
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:02,820
It is like how do you cite in a scope
for something for people to know what

1556
01:05:02,821 --> 01:05:04,800
we're talking about.
Like if you shoot a rifle,

1557
01:05:04,830 --> 01:05:07,620
rifle,
a bullet goes very fast so you could

1558
01:05:07,621 --> 01:05:11,580
shoot out into a 100 yards and it
essentially is going to go exactly where

1559
01:05:11,581 --> 01:05:14,490
you're aiming at.
But then when you go to 200 yards it

1560
01:05:14,491 --> 01:05:17,590
gets a little tricky and you have to
adjust your scope because it'll a little

1561
01:05:17,591 --> 01:05:17,830
bit.

1562
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:20,200
You get to 300 yards,
it'll drop a little bit more.

1563
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:23,410
Four hundred yards in oud is where it
gets really weird.

1564
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:27,070
Like you're dealing with wind drift,
you're dealing with drop.

1565
01:05:27,610 --> 01:05:32,610
So I would imagine that a dart is not
going very fast so it probably drops

1566
01:05:32,921 --> 01:05:34,930
quite a bit.
It does and it's heavy.

1567
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:37,430
They're fairly long there.
I don't know how many grains is it?

1568
01:05:37,450 --> 01:05:40,210
Half inches.
I don't know how many grains they are.

1569
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:43,220
They don't come those measurements and
I've never weighed once.

1570
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:46,810
I'm not positive,
but obviously because they are going so

1571
01:05:46,811 --> 01:05:48,850
slow,
they're dealing with wind drift at.

1572
01:05:48,940 --> 01:05:50,440
Yeah,
five meters,

1573
01:05:50,441 --> 01:05:53,200
then you can start doing it.
So if you're not aerodynamic either.

1574
01:05:53,201 --> 01:05:55,540
Right?
It's not horrible.

1575
01:05:55,541 --> 01:05:58,750
I mean it's basically looks like a
syringe with a needle on the end and we

1576
01:05:58,751 --> 01:06:00,460
have some feathers on the end.
Oh,

1577
01:06:00,461 --> 01:06:04,310
so you have like flushings to make sure
I wouldn't call it fletcher genes.

1578
01:06:04,310 --> 01:06:05,290
It's,
that's what it looks like.

1579
01:06:05,291 --> 01:06:06,011
Yeah,
exactly.

1580
01:06:06,011 --> 01:06:10,290
Like that.
Twenty ml air for 10 point.

1581
01:06:10,291 --> 01:06:11,560
Oh,
ml dart was at me.

1582
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:16,030
So that's a,
you can put 20 milliliters of air for

1583
01:06:16,031 --> 01:06:17,950
the tin.
That dark.

1584
01:06:17,951 --> 01:06:20,410
That's holds 10 milliliters of drug.
Oh,

1585
01:06:20,411 --> 01:06:22,900
I see.
So that's not the exact drug we use.

1586
01:06:22,901 --> 01:06:24,750
We use one called a,
I believe it's a nude art.

1587
01:06:25,350 --> 01:06:26,850
It's a little different.
It actually has a.

1588
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:29,440
So ours,
at least the ones we use for the deer,

1589
01:06:29,441 --> 01:06:32,680
we use these types as well.
But for the deer we use ones that have a

1590
01:06:32,681 --> 01:06:35,330
little charge and um,
so when it hits it discharges basically

1591
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:40,210
by like a shell would gunpowder in there
that trigger triggers off Jesus Christ.

1592
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:43,900
Wow.
So you have to sneak up on these deer

1593
01:06:43,901 --> 01:06:45,790
and then do this.
Yeah.

1594
01:06:45,791 --> 01:06:47,310
So what I was going to tell you what
kind of,

1595
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:49,990
how we adjust for that distance,
because that's the last question you

1596
01:06:49,991 --> 01:06:50,440
were asking.

1597
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:53,140
So the nice thing about our rifles
versus a regular rifle.

1598
01:06:53,141 --> 01:06:56,830
So you get one chill and that's what you
go with us because it's air powered,

1599
01:06:56,831 --> 01:07:01,210
we can adjust our pressure.
So to account for that distance,

1600
01:07:01,211 --> 01:07:06,211
we know at 20 yards we do two bars of
pressure at 30 yards we do three bars of

1601
01:07:06,941 --> 01:07:08,740
pressure,
that type of thing.

1602
01:07:08,741 --> 01:07:10,030
Wow.
So we have a little bit more

1603
01:07:10,031 --> 01:07:13,270
adjustability than typical rifle would.
So you walking around with a range

1604
01:07:13,271 --> 01:07:17,290
finder and then you're,
you're changing it on your rifle as you

1605
01:07:17,291 --> 01:07:18,850
go along?
Yeah.

1606
01:07:18,851 --> 01:07:22,060
As we make our decision we.
Because we don't like we don't walk with

1607
01:07:22,061 --> 01:07:23,050
it charged.
We,

1608
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:26,470
I mean our darts in there ready to go,
but we don't fire.

1609
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:30,240
I mean we don't have our,
our pressure up until we know what deer

1610
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:34,210
we're taking in the distance.
And Are you aiming for center mass?

1611
01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:35,590
Hip.
Hip?

1612
01:07:35,950 --> 01:07:37,120
Huh?
Why hip?

1613
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:38,500
Because that's where the biggest muscle
is.

1614
01:07:38,830 --> 01:07:39,580
Oh,
I see.

1615
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:40,810
Okay.
So the DA,

1616
01:07:40,830 --> 01:07:45,830
the drugs enact intramuscularly,
so if you accidentally hit the ribs,

1617
01:07:47,921 --> 01:07:50,320
it's not good.
It's not great.

1618
01:07:50,321 --> 01:07:52,900
No,
it's still will probably put them to

1619
01:07:52,901 --> 01:07:56,290
sleep.
The needles aren't long enough that it

1620
01:07:56,291 --> 01:07:58,800
should do much damage.
So I'm gonna hit a vital right.

1621
01:07:58,870 --> 01:08:01,390
I mean you can never say never,
but yeah,

1622
01:08:01,391 --> 01:08:02,590
it shouldn't,
but it's not going to kill him.

1623
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:04,670
It shouldn't know.
Um,

1624
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:07,840
and that we practice a lot to make sure
we hit where we want to hit.

1625
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:10,450
How do you practice?
Do you have a rubber deer that you shoot

1626
01:08:10,451 --> 01:08:13,090
at a.
We have archery targets that we shoot

1627
01:08:13,091 --> 01:08:13,540
at.
Yeah.

1628
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:15,710
Wow,
that's interesting.

1629
01:08:15,770 --> 01:08:19,700
And do you use a regular rifle scope or
do you have like a scope specifically

1630
01:08:19,701 --> 01:08:21,980
designed for darts now?
It's a regular rifle scope.

1631
01:08:22,610 --> 01:08:24,590
No kidding.
Wow.

1632
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:27,170
So how often do you practice in?
Um,

1633
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:29,480
before we do it,
I practice quite a few times.

1634
01:08:29,481 --> 01:08:33,020
I go out like I don't practice daily
like you do with the archery,

1635
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:36,530
but I practice pretty regularly when I,
right before I was starting,

1636
01:08:36,531 --> 01:08:39,320
these last two were kind of taking a
break right now because they're falling

1637
01:08:39,830 --> 01:08:41,900
and so we don't want to dart them while
there.

1638
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:46,130
Of course I'm dragging and dropping
fonds we weren't until fonts a little

1639
01:08:46,131 --> 01:08:47,720
bigger.
That's interesting.

1640
01:08:47,780 --> 01:08:50,360
Have you ever missed one?
Um,

1641
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,270
I haven't taken that many shots.
Did I miss any of my shots?

1642
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:54,980
How many of you darted?
Just the two.

1643
01:08:55,430 --> 01:08:56,263
Just to.
Yeah.

1644
01:08:56,540 --> 01:08:58,730
And we,
this is our first time doing dear stuff.

1645
01:08:58,731 --> 01:09:02,240
So fish and game came out and helped us
with these guys and which was great.

1646
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:04,670
And you have to dart to Moore's that
would just said for more.

1647
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:05,593
For more.
Yep.

1648
01:09:05,690 --> 01:09:08,420
And why six?
Is that just like you just want a good

1649
01:09:08,421 --> 01:09:12,170
study number that.
So we're looking at roadways and trying

1650
01:09:12,171 --> 01:09:15,440
to identify crossing points for what I
mean we're not just doing dear,

1651
01:09:15,441 --> 01:09:18,740
we're doing other species as well,
but we're trying to identify where we

1652
01:09:18,741 --> 01:09:20,000
can make improvements,
things like that.

1653
01:09:20,001 --> 01:09:25,001
Wildlife overpass in other areas.
So that's why we're doing that and so

1654
01:09:25,101 --> 01:09:27,920
we're just trying to get a sample size
that we can kind of work with and the

1655
01:09:27,921 --> 01:09:30,980
colors aren't cheap so it's,
it's about resources and what we have

1656
01:09:30,981 --> 01:09:34,970
that we can use towards the project and
what and what are you trying to gather?

1657
01:09:34,990 --> 01:09:35,570
Like what,
what,

1658
01:09:35,570 --> 01:09:38,600
what data?
So it's all movement based data.

1659
01:09:38,601 --> 01:09:40,700
So they,
these are gps collars,

1660
01:09:40,701 --> 01:09:44,730
they transmit us,
can be anywhere from I think the color

1661
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:48,410
60 points a day down to I think my
lowest eight points a day.

1662
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:51,860
And so it'll tell me,
it'll give me an idea of where the deer

1663
01:09:51,861 --> 01:09:55,190
are approaching the roadways and how
they're moving relative to the roadway

1664
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:58,820
so we can help come up with mitigation
to improve their ability to get across.

1665
01:09:59,150 --> 01:09:59,691
Oh,
okay.

1666
01:09:59,691 --> 01:10:03,560
So it's all about their migration and
where they're moving around and keeping

1667
01:10:03,561 --> 01:10:05,240
them away from danger.
Yeah.

1668
01:10:05,241 --> 01:10:06,620
I mean I wouldn't quite call it
migration,

1669
01:10:06,621 --> 01:10:08,780
but close enough.
That's the idea is just to help them

1670
01:10:08,781 --> 01:10:09,620
build,
to get across.

1671
01:10:09,950 --> 01:10:12,050
Now,
are they Columbia blacktail?

1672
01:10:12,470 --> 01:10:14,560
These are not.
These are mule deer in our mouth.

1673
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:15,660
Mule deer.
No.

1674
01:10:15,830 --> 01:10:19,700
Kenny.
And are they like a pure mule deer?

1675
01:10:19,970 --> 01:10:21,830
I believe so,
yeah.

1676
01:10:21,831 --> 01:10:23,480
The black start a little bit north of
us.

1677
01:10:23,481 --> 01:10:25,370
I don't remember exactly where the cut
off line is.

1678
01:10:25,371 --> 01:10:29,120
But so like right around here,
like in the hills and like encino and

1679
01:10:29,121 --> 01:10:29,690
stuff like that.

1680
01:10:29,690 --> 01:10:31,130
Those are mule deer.
Mule deer.

1681
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:32,570
Wow.
That's interesting.

1682
01:10:32,571 --> 01:10:33,261
Yeah.
Yeah.

1683
01:10:33,261 --> 01:10:36,860
I always thought that too because I,
I've deer hunted for years and I've

1684
01:10:36,861 --> 01:10:38,040
always thought blocked hill.
But no,

1685
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:39,920
once I got here and started working with
them I was like,

1686
01:10:39,950 --> 01:10:40,940
oh,
these are on mule deer.

1687
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:42,800
No,
how did they make the differentiation,

1688
01:10:42,801 --> 01:10:45,840
how they understand that there's some
just physical characteristic differences

1689
01:10:45,841 --> 01:10:50,090
and I think there's been some genetic
work done as well because traditionally

1690
01:10:50,091 --> 01:10:53,330
when you think of mule deal,
you think of a large deer with a big

1691
01:10:53,331 --> 01:10:56,120
rack.
Like mule deer have enormous racks.

1692
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,550
Like that deer right there.
That's a mule deer.

1693
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:00,650
Yep.
Like if you saw one of those around

1694
01:11:00,651 --> 01:11:01,221
here,
you'd be like,

1695
01:11:01,221 --> 01:11:04,730
Holy Shit.
Like you never see a deer that big

1696
01:11:04,731 --> 01:11:05,990
around here.
No.

1697
01:11:05,991 --> 01:11:07,310
I mean there's some decent deer in these
mountains.

1698
01:11:07,311 --> 01:11:08,190
But yeah,
it's.

1699
01:11:08,270 --> 01:11:08,961
I mean,
but mule,

1700
01:11:08,961 --> 01:11:11,810
not all mule deer,
that big course where there's mule deer

1701
01:11:11,811 --> 01:11:13,070
that are still quite small.

1702
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:15,260
That's just what we're dealing with here
is the smaller end.

1703
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:17,400
Do you think it's because of the
predators,

1704
01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:19,710
like they never really get a chance to
get that big because there's the

1705
01:11:19,711 --> 01:11:22,620
populations are pretty small or is it a
genetic issue?

1706
01:11:22,710 --> 01:11:26,250
We think it's a genetic issue.
I mean there,

1707
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:29,880
this population's been kind of isolated
for a long time from others,

1708
01:11:29,881 --> 01:11:33,000
but California generally is not thought
of to have monster box even though

1709
01:11:33,001 --> 01:11:34,860
there's plenty of mule deer in this
state,

1710
01:11:35,370 --> 01:11:40,350
so it's more just the factor of what's
here and so north of us is where the

1711
01:11:40,351 --> 01:11:42,540
blacktail are and were like,
where did that,

1712
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:44,490
what does that range begin?
I wish I could.

1713
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:47,430
I'm not sure off the top of my head.
The inner breeding,

1714
01:11:47,431 --> 01:11:48,870
correct.
I'm sure there is.

1715
01:11:48,910 --> 01:11:50,280
Yeah.
And they're viable.

1716
01:11:50,350 --> 01:11:52,380
Are they hybrids?
I would assume they're viable,

1717
01:11:52,381 --> 01:11:53,670
but I am not positive.

1718
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:54,810
Hmm.
Yeah,

1719
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:56,550
I'm not.
I'm definitely not fully up on all the

1720
01:11:56,551 --> 01:11:59,460
deer literature.
So what other animals are you guys

1721
01:11:59,461 --> 01:12:00,790
concerned with?
Like their,

1722
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:03,420
their,
their safety and populations.

1723
01:12:03,690 --> 01:12:05,730
So I mean we're worried about the whole
community.

1724
01:12:05,731 --> 01:12:08,670
I mean we do things with frogs.
Salamanders,

1725
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:11,670
we do surveys for snakes.
Um,

1726
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:14,040
we actually have a red legged frog
reintroduction.

1727
01:12:14,570 --> 01:12:15,880
Reintroduction.
Yeah.

1728
01:12:15,990 --> 01:12:19,020
So there's people complaining.
Not enough red legged frogs.

1729
01:12:19,050 --> 01:12:22,350
Well there used to be here and we had a,
well we don't really know why they

1730
01:12:22,351 --> 01:12:26,520
disappeared but they disappeared 30
years ago or so and they were left in

1731
01:12:26,521 --> 01:12:30,510
one little pool in one place.
And so we're just trying to help them

1732
01:12:30,511 --> 01:12:31,540
get reestablished,
do it.

1733
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:36,560
Don't let Donald Trump find out about
this cut funding frog what we need that

1734
01:12:37,051 --> 01:12:38,800
money to go to bankers.
Yeah.

1735
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:43,170
I mean it's just seems fascinating to me
that we do have these programs to like

1736
01:12:43,171 --> 01:12:44,670
help out like a frog.

1737
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:47,340
Yeah.
I mean it's all better but man hours,

1738
01:12:47,341 --> 01:12:48,530
right?
A,

1739
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:50,610
it takes some but it's not huge amounts.
May.

1740
01:12:50,620 --> 01:12:53,880
It's one person going out and doing
these projects and it's not like that's

1741
01:12:53,881 --> 01:12:55,650
their only job.
They have lots of different things they

1742
01:12:55,651 --> 01:12:57,870
did right.
So it's just one small part of their

1743
01:12:57,871 --> 01:12:59,490
job.
So they just bring like a bucket of

1744
01:12:59,491 --> 01:13:03,930
frogs and thrown into the bushes.
It's not quite that simple.

1745
01:13:03,990 --> 01:13:06,270
They have to move egg masses basically
is what they do.

1746
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:09,270
What they do when they move the egg
masses.

1747
01:13:09,271 --> 01:13:11,270
Do they move the mom as well and,
or the,

1748
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:14,040
the,
the frogs just develop independently and

1749
01:13:14,050 --> 01:13:15,010
the new area.
Yeah,

1750
01:13:15,011 --> 01:13:16,890
they develop independently.
They would even do that in their own

1751
01:13:16,891 --> 01:13:19,020
area.
The mom doesn't care for their frogs or

1752
01:13:19,021 --> 01:13:23,730
any of that to bitches bitches.
So when they do that,

1753
01:13:23,731 --> 01:13:24,570
when they,
um,

1754
01:13:24,571 --> 01:13:27,150
when you drop off these egg masses in
this place,

1755
01:13:27,730 --> 01:13:31,290
so this frog will be born or hatch in
this area rather.

1756
01:13:31,530 --> 01:13:33,210
And they just assume this is where they
live?

1757
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:34,950
Yup.
Oh that's interesting.

1758
01:13:34,951 --> 01:13:37,560
So if you took a fully developed frog
and put it there,

1759
01:13:37,561 --> 01:13:40,560
probably wouldn't know what to do with
the area because it would be a new area

1760
01:13:40,561 --> 01:13:41,161
for it.
It'd be like,

1761
01:13:41,161 --> 01:13:42,570
why am I here?
Yeah.

1762
01:13:42,571 --> 01:13:45,990
This isn't my project either.
So I'm not 100 percent on it,

1763
01:13:45,991 --> 01:13:49,500
but from my understanding is that they
will try to move back towards their

1764
01:13:49,501 --> 01:13:51,840
native range and then they don't end up
making it,

1765
01:13:51,841 --> 01:13:56,430
so it's better to do the tadpoles or the
eggs and then they'll hopefully stay

1766
01:13:56,431 --> 01:13:57,600
there.
That's cool.

1767
01:13:57,660 --> 01:14:00,660
So what is the benefit of having these
red legged frogs around?

1768
01:14:00,661 --> 01:14:04,030
They're just a part of the ecosystem.
We think it's a good idea to exactly it.

1769
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:05,760
Just trying to protect the overall
ecosystem.

1770
01:14:05,761 --> 01:14:09,240
We don't really understand.
I mean we like to think we understand

1771
01:14:09,241 --> 01:14:11,420
all this ecology and all that,
but they're,

1772
01:14:11,430 --> 01:14:12,370
it's,
it's complicated,

1773
01:14:12,371 --> 01:14:12,520
right?

1774
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:14,320
We don't know the interaction between
all of these species.

1775
01:14:14,321 --> 01:14:17,500
So a lot of it's just trying to make
sure that our full suite of species is

1776
01:14:17,501 --> 01:14:20,860
there.
So our ecosystems healthy as possible.

1777
01:14:21,130 --> 01:14:25,510
So when you reintroduce the red frog,
will there then be subsequent studies

1778
01:14:25,511 --> 01:14:28,870
about the impact of the reintroduction
of the Red Frog red legged frog?

1779
01:14:28,871 --> 01:14:31,570
And it's hard to know at this point.
I mean it's all based off funding,

1780
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:36,070
like there's potential there,
but right now we don't really know.

1781
01:14:36,290 --> 01:14:36,971
Sorry,
let me,

1782
01:14:36,971 --> 01:14:38,710
uh,
propose this to you.

1783
01:14:38,890 --> 01:14:42,070
What if you had an unlimited budget?
What if I made Justin Brown king of the

1784
01:14:42,071 --> 01:14:43,930
world and I said,
listen dude,

1785
01:14:43,931 --> 01:14:46,640
you can do whatever the fuck you want
with the all this money and what,

1786
01:14:46,641 --> 01:14:48,640
what would you do if you make any
promises here?

1787
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:49,800
No,
I wish I could.

1788
01:14:49,870 --> 01:14:51,400
I wish I could.
Obviously I don't have that kind of

1789
01:14:51,401 --> 01:14:53,320
power,
but of course if I did though,

1790
01:14:53,321 --> 01:14:54,430
if I said,
listen man,

1791
01:14:54,431 --> 01:14:57,490
I'm going to give you an unlimited
budget to take care of this wildlife as

1792
01:14:57,491 --> 01:14:59,800
you would see fit,
what would you like to have done?

1793
01:14:59,980 --> 01:15:01,180
Well,
one of the first things would be that

1794
01:15:01,181 --> 01:15:03,700
wildlife overpass you see for our
released.

1795
01:15:03,701 --> 01:15:07,570
If you're talking about doing things for
what's good for the local ecology here,

1796
01:15:07,630 --> 01:15:10,540
that would be probably the highest thing
on my priority list because that is

1797
01:15:10,541 --> 01:15:12,820
something that's not just affecting one
species.

1798
01:15:12,821 --> 01:15:15,400
It's affecting everything that's within
our mountain range,

1799
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:19,870
which is fairly large hundred 50,000
acres that there's just completely being

1800
01:15:19,871 --> 01:15:23,680
disconnected from other wildlife.
So to me that that's our number one

1801
01:15:23,681 --> 01:15:24,850
thing.
The other thing is,

1802
01:15:24,851 --> 01:15:27,910
so we have lots of issues with these
poisons there.

1803
01:15:28,030 --> 01:15:31,720
I would try to find alternatives to
these poisons that are being spread

1804
01:15:31,721 --> 01:15:34,330
throughout the environment because
that's a major issue for our wildlife.

1805
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:37,090
Yeah.
That is a giant issue when you see the

1806
01:15:37,091 --> 01:15:40,460
main on that cat and he's.
I think that that all comes somehow or

1807
01:15:40,461 --> 01:15:43,150
another from rat poison,
like whatever that happened to rat

1808
01:15:43,151 --> 01:15:43,780
traps.

1809
01:15:43,780 --> 01:15:46,270
Like I will just use a trap and people
don't like to see blood.

1810
01:15:46,570 --> 01:15:49,150
Is that what it is?
That's my best assumption because

1811
01:15:49,151 --> 01:15:50,890
people,
you try to recommend traps and they just

1812
01:15:50,891 --> 01:15:53,080
won't do it,
but there's such a trickle down though

1813
01:15:53,081 --> 01:15:55,030
when you're using those toxins,
you know,

1814
01:15:55,380 --> 01:15:57,310
it sets.
That's frightening to me because that

1815
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:59,440
gets to people in some way,
shape or form.

1816
01:15:59,530 --> 01:16:00,363
Yeah,
definitely.

1817
01:16:00,530 --> 01:16:01,170
Yeah,
that's,

1818
01:16:01,170 --> 01:16:03,850
that's my worry as well.
It also leaks into the ground.

1819
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:06,330
Like there's,
there's all sorts of weird effects that

1820
01:16:06,331 --> 01:16:08,140
you can get from poisons.
Yeah,

1821
01:16:08,141 --> 01:16:10,960
and we don't even understand the facts.
We put tons of toxicants out there that

1822
01:16:10,961 --> 01:16:15,961
we have no idea the actual longterm
effects or how it's gonna change things.

1823
01:16:16,031 --> 01:16:17,150
I mean,
like these rat poisons,

1824
01:16:17,151 --> 01:16:18,940
there was a long time,
they said it wouldn't move up the food

1825
01:16:18,941 --> 01:16:20,860
chain,
but we are quite clearly seeing it move

1826
01:16:20,861 --> 01:16:23,800
up the food chain to have a mountain
lion die of rat poison.

1827
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:25,870
It's crazy too.
They dive in.

1828
01:16:25,930 --> 01:16:28,210
Yeah.
We've had three mountain lions dive rat

1829
01:16:28,211 --> 01:16:29,230
poison.
Wow.

1830
01:16:29,290 --> 01:16:31,870
And you believe it's from coyotes.
That's what we think.

1831
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:33,220
Yeah.
So one of them,

1832
01:16:33,221 --> 01:16:36,880
they went back to a few kills that it
made right before it died.

1833
01:16:37,090 --> 01:16:39,100
And they found that it killed a couple
coyotes.

1834
01:16:39,350 --> 01:16:40,570
Uh,
wow.

1835
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:41,560
Wow.
No,

1836
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:43,770
it doesn't kill the coyotes.
Uh,

1837
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:45,400
who knows?
The coyotes could have been really sick

1838
01:16:45,401 --> 01:16:47,260
at that point.
And maybe that's how the mountain lion

1839
01:16:47,261 --> 01:16:48,670
got it anyway.
Exactly.

1840
01:16:48,671 --> 01:16:51,490
So because with these poisons,
a lot of times these animals don't die

1841
01:16:51,491 --> 01:16:54,310
for four to 10 days.
Oh God.

1842
01:16:54,311 --> 01:16:56,350
So they're walking in circles.
I don't know if you've ever seen like

1843
01:16:56,351 --> 01:16:58,510
wrath walking circles that are running
into buildings,

1844
01:16:58,570 --> 01:17:01,180
like I've seen it a couple times about
walking around and that's generally what

1845
01:17:01,181 --> 01:17:02,050
they're dying.
They're dying,

1846
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:04,840
they're dying of dehydration basically
because they're just bleeding out

1847
01:17:04,841 --> 01:17:05,674
internally.

1848
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:08,870
Yeah.
So that was actually in Dan Flores,

1849
01:17:08,871 --> 01:17:13,460
his book is that they had developed
certain types of coyote poisons that

1850
01:17:13,461 --> 01:17:17,780
were slow acting so that they could
trick these coyotes into eating this

1851
01:17:17,781 --> 01:17:21,380
stuff and the other coyotes wouldn't
know where the caio got sick from

1852
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:25,310
because it took so long for them to die.
It wasn't like strychnine where you eat

1853
01:17:25,311 --> 01:17:27,790
it.
You watched the other one die and that

1854
01:17:27,890 --> 01:17:31,460
that's also what rats do.
Did you ever see that documentary on

1855
01:17:31,461 --> 01:17:32,510
Netflix?
I heard you mentioned it,

1856
01:17:32,511 --> 01:17:34,660
but I still haven't seen it yet.
You got to watch it.

1857
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:37,100
It's amazing.
It freaked me out.

1858
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:40,790
It's nuts.
Like when when they show the amount of

1859
01:17:40,791 --> 01:17:45,080
rats that are in New York City and they
show all the people dealing with them

1860
01:17:45,081 --> 01:17:47,330
and they show them in the sewer system
and everything,

1861
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:52,360
it's mind boggling and then they talk
about how the rats will literally send a

1862
01:17:53,391 --> 01:17:57,920
young dumb rat over to the poison and
they want that rat eat the poison and

1863
01:17:57,921 --> 01:17:59,030
died and they're like,
fuck this,

1864
01:17:59,031 --> 01:17:59,480
we're out here.

1865
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:02,330
And they all take off.
Like they've got a whole system for

1866
01:18:02,331 --> 01:18:03,740
dealing with poisons.
Yeah.

1867
01:18:03,741 --> 01:18:04,910
Well,
because they did the same thing with rat

1868
01:18:04,911 --> 01:18:06,220
poison.
It's my understanding they,

1869
01:18:06,221 --> 01:18:09,920
they kind of come through different,
more for the poisoned to try to make

1870
01:18:09,921 --> 01:18:11,850
them last a little longer.
So the [inaudible],

1871
01:18:11,851 --> 01:18:14,900
the rats will do the same thing.
The coyotes do not to eat it.

1872
01:18:14,901 --> 01:18:16,790
So that didn't surprise me.
They saw that documentary.

1873
01:18:16,791 --> 01:18:19,820
I'll have to watch that.
There's no way to mitigate the problem

1874
01:18:19,821 --> 01:18:20,360
now.
I mean,

1875
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:22,820
the rat population is so large in New
York City.

1876
01:18:22,821 --> 01:18:26,060
They think there's many rats as there
are people or more.

1877
01:18:26,310 --> 01:18:27,290
Yeah,
I believe it.

1878
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:30,650
I mean,
I've been in little intersections down

1879
01:18:30,651 --> 01:18:34,100
in la at night and just rats,
it looks like the ground is moving at

1880
01:18:34,101 --> 01:18:36,650
times and these crazy locations,
like most of the places you go,

1881
01:18:36,651 --> 01:18:38,750
you don't see that many rats,
but then all of a sudden you'll hit this

1882
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:42,530
called a honey hole for frats and
they'll just be like,

1883
01:18:42,740 --> 01:18:45,050
whoa,
look at what the hell's going on here.

1884
01:18:45,140 --> 01:18:47,030
I was in New York City way back in the
day.

1885
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:49,820
It was so long ago.
There was payphones and uh,

1886
01:18:49,940 --> 01:18:52,250
I uh,
had to make phone call and I was getting

1887
01:18:52,251 --> 01:18:56,390
gas so I pulled up this gas station,
put the pump in,

1888
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:01,310
filling up my car and I go over to this
payphone to make a call and as I mean in

1889
01:19:01,311 --> 01:19:05,030
the time it took me to walk from the
pump to the payphone,

1890
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:09,320
I'm watching rats jumped onto the wheels
of my car,

1891
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:13,790
like they're jumping on the wheel and
crawling up and down to like,

1892
01:19:13,791 --> 01:19:16,400
I don't know if they're looking for food
or they're looking to get into the

1893
01:19:16,401 --> 01:19:20,300
engine for warmth or whatever,
but apparently people have a real issue

1894
01:19:20,301 --> 01:19:25,301
with rats getting inside the hood of
their car and like nesting there,

1895
01:19:25,871 --> 01:19:30,140
like climb in there for the heat and
they stay warm inside the hood of your

1896
01:19:30,141 --> 01:19:30,890
car.

1897
01:19:30,890 --> 01:19:31,770
Good Lord.
Yeah.

1898
01:19:31,790 --> 01:19:35,450
I mean they're so adaptable,
but they instantaneously did it.

1899
01:19:35,451 --> 01:19:36,560
I mean,
I pulled the car up,

1900
01:19:36,740 --> 01:19:38,330
put the pump in,
walked,

1901
01:19:38,390 --> 01:19:40,100
turned around like,
what the fuck?

1902
01:19:40,350 --> 01:19:42,560
I'm not talking about like one rat.
I'm talking five,

1903
01:19:42,561 --> 01:19:44,630
six,
seven rats just hopping up.

1904
01:19:44,631 --> 01:19:46,670
And another one would hop up and one
would hop down.

1905
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:49,070
It was terrifying because I was trying
to figure out,

1906
01:19:49,071 --> 01:19:50,620
okay,
am I going to be driving,

1907
01:19:50,630 --> 01:19:53,240
there's going to be a rat on the floor
and then I'm going to hit the gas

1908
01:19:53,241 --> 01:19:55,220
instead of the.
So I'm going to freak out like a little

1909
01:19:55,221 --> 01:19:56,510
girl.
Yeah.

1910
01:19:56,511 --> 01:19:57,530
It was terrifying.
Yeah,

1911
01:19:57,531 --> 01:20:00,290
that would be creepy.
But there's just so adaptable.

1912
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:01,270
I mean,
and it's,

1913
01:20:01,350 --> 01:20:04,370
it's another,
essentially we don't like to think of

1914
01:20:04,371 --> 01:20:08,400
them as a wild animal,
but a rat is a wild that lives in this

1915
01:20:08,401 --> 01:20:12,120
weird symbiotic relationship with people
in urban environments.

1916
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:13,550
I mean,
it's amazing there.

1917
01:20:13,740 --> 01:20:16,230
That is the one species.
It's probably more adapted to us than

1918
01:20:16,231 --> 01:20:20,400
the coyotes are obviously because they
are able to live in almost everywhere

1919
01:20:20,401 --> 01:20:21,510
that we live.
Yeah.

1920
01:20:21,630 --> 01:20:22,740
And they're,
I mean,

1921
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:25,140
they serve a purpose in some sort of a
weird way.

1922
01:20:25,141 --> 01:20:26,580
I mean,
and if they were removed,

1923
01:20:26,850 --> 01:20:29,480
I wonder what the impact would be.
Yeah.

1924
01:20:29,490 --> 01:20:31,380
I mean,
I'm sure we'd probably have more nesting

1925
01:20:31,381 --> 01:20:34,500
birds and some of that kind of stuff
because we know that rats definitely

1926
01:20:34,501 --> 01:20:36,680
impact bird species.
Um,

1927
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:38,460
and who knows,
there may not be,

1928
01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:39,930
if there were,
wasn't rats,

1929
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:42,900
whether coyotes or some of these other
small predators would be around the

1930
01:20:42,901 --> 01:20:45,490
urban areas because they're obviously
another prey source know.

1931
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:48,030
But trying to get rid of rats is a whole
nother ballgame.

1932
01:20:48,090 --> 01:20:49,220
Good luck.
Yeah.

1933
01:20:49,330 --> 01:20:50,380
Yeah.
That's,

1934
01:20:50,450 --> 01:20:51,780
that's the one that's probably harder in
coyotes,

1935
01:20:51,781 --> 01:20:53,160
theaters and nuke that city.

1936
01:20:53,350 --> 01:20:57,140
You'd have to get everybody to agree and
then they'd probably move back in within

1937
01:20:57,180 --> 01:20:58,230
a couple of years.
Yeah.

1938
01:20:58,580 --> 01:20:59,310
Yeah.
It's just,

1939
01:20:59,310 --> 01:21:04,230
you're not going to do it.
So this proposed bridge across the 101,

1940
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:06,330
what is,
is there a roadblocks as it a funding

1941
01:21:06,331 --> 01:21:09,150
issue?
Is there anybody that is against it?

1942
01:21:09,630 --> 01:21:12,120
As far as we know,
there's not anybody really against that.

1943
01:21:12,121 --> 01:21:14,580
There might be a few people in the
nearby community that's worried about

1944
01:21:14,581 --> 01:21:16,200
more mountain lions come in or
something,

1945
01:21:16,201 --> 01:21:20,880
but we don't think that's a realistic
thing because that holding capacity from

1946
01:21:20,881 --> 01:21:24,180
as far as we understand.
So we don't think that's going to be a

1947
01:21:24,181 --> 01:21:25,350
major issue.
Um,

1948
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:27,900
but it's really about funding.
We're trying to.

1949
01:21:27,930 --> 01:21:31,320
National Wildlife Federation is leading
the charge to try to raise,

1950
01:21:31,350 --> 01:21:34,470
I think the cost is over $50,000,000 to
do this.

1951
01:21:34,471 --> 01:21:34,970
Yeah.
So it's,

1952
01:21:34,970 --> 01:21:36,950
it's a big price tag.
Um,

1953
01:21:36,990 --> 01:21:38,490
the bridge is going to be quite wide.

1954
01:21:38,550 --> 01:21:43,080
It's going to be natural covered and
it's going to ask to go over the road

1955
01:21:43,081 --> 01:21:45,600
and the one on one both.
And so.

1956
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:47,580
Oh,
it's going to be a big bridge.

1957
01:21:48,150 --> 01:21:51,490
So I hope wide.
Is that who I wish I could call that off

1958
01:21:51,491 --> 01:21:52,630
the top of my head.
I.

1959
01:21:53,410 --> 01:21:53,971
Yeah,
sorry.

1960
01:21:53,971 --> 01:21:55,550
You'd have to look it up.
I think it's probably on that thing he

1961
01:21:55,551 --> 01:21:58,470
had up earlier.
So you probably deal with a few hundred

1962
01:21:58,470 --> 01:21:59,340
yards or something.
Yeah,

1963
01:21:59,341 --> 01:22:01,470
I mean it's almost as wide as it is
long.

1964
01:22:01,860 --> 01:22:02,700
Oh Wow.
Yeah.

1965
01:22:02,701 --> 01:22:04,680
So it's going to be big.
It's gonna also how it's going to be

1966
01:22:04,681 --> 01:22:09,240
used for hiking during the day as well.
So it's not just for wildlife so people

1967
01:22:09,241 --> 01:22:10,860
can go across it.
Exactly.

1968
01:22:10,861 --> 01:22:15,861
Because currently there's no easy way to
go from the Santa Monica is in the south

1969
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,240
to the cme Hilton,
the north,

1970
01:22:18,241 --> 01:22:19,800
which are all public property.

1971
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:22,500
So there's no way to get across there so
people can hide,

1972
01:22:22,501 --> 01:22:26,850
they have to go down on the Liberty
Canyon road and cut across there,

1973
01:22:26,851 --> 01:22:30,150
which is kind of sucky.
So how does one raise money for

1974
01:22:30,151 --> 01:22:33,240
something like this?
Do they try to have like a go fund me or

1975
01:22:33,241 --> 01:22:36,870
do they just rely on the state budget?
No,

1976
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:40,260
it's all they're doing fundraising,
trying to get people to kick in.

1977
01:22:40,261 --> 01:22:44,670
I believe the Annenberg has already
offered to donate a million dollars

1978
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,890
matching,
so they've got to raise another million

1979
01:22:46,891 --> 01:22:51,150
to get that amount.
It's all for the most part,

1980
01:22:51,151 --> 01:22:54,930
I believe it's all from either
conservation agencies or from private

1981
01:22:54,931 --> 01:22:56,610
donations.
So if you were king of the world,

1982
01:22:56,611 --> 01:22:59,160
that would be the first thing that you
would work on.

1983
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:03,120
As far as wildlife in California,
I'm definitely for our region,

1984
01:23:03,121 --> 01:23:04,380
yes.
What about other issues?

1985
01:23:04,670 --> 01:23:06,850
Other issues?
I mean habitat protections just

1986
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,170
obviously incredibly important.

1987
01:23:08,170 --> 01:23:12,850
If we want to keep all of our species,
so protecting more land is is always a

1988
01:23:12,851 --> 01:23:15,130
valuable thing to make sure that,
or at least to make sure what

1989
01:23:15,131 --> 01:23:17,350
development we do is done in a proper
way.

1990
01:23:17,770 --> 01:23:21,040
Now when you say protect more land,
would that be like buying up available

1991
01:23:21,041 --> 01:23:24,640
private land when it comes for sale and
then turning it into public land?

1992
01:23:24,930 --> 01:23:27,460
Um,
to some level I would consider that.

1993
01:23:27,461 --> 01:23:29,320
I don't know if that would be my
ultimate goal.

1994
01:23:29,321 --> 01:23:33,430
To me it's more important to lock it up
so it's natural versus public versus

1995
01:23:33,431 --> 01:23:34,151
private.
Oh.

1996
01:23:34,151 --> 01:23:38,140
So like to stop a development stop,
major developments from coming in and

1997
01:23:38,141 --> 01:23:41,470
putting things right in places that are
going to be major blockages to wildlife

1998
01:23:41,471 --> 01:23:43,660
movement.
Boulder's kind of interesting in that

1999
01:23:43,661 --> 01:23:47,530
way where they buy up all the available
property and then turn into open space.

2000
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:50,140
So you can't develop on it ever.
Yeah.

2001
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:52,170
They're really smart with that because
they,

2002
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:56,020
I think boulder is an amazing place and
that they've really recognized that they

2003
01:23:56,021 --> 01:24:01,021
have this incredible sort of beautiful
little community that's surrounded by

2004
01:24:01,631 --> 01:24:04,570
this inescapable beauty of the
mountains,

2005
01:24:04,571 --> 01:24:07,240
the rockies.
You don't get much more beautiful place

2006
01:24:07,241 --> 01:24:08,950
in around boulders.
Makes Sense.

2007
01:24:08,951 --> 01:24:10,630
I mean,
if you want to keep your communities the

2008
01:24:10,631 --> 01:24:12,310
way they are,
you kind of have to protect some of the

2009
01:24:12,311 --> 01:24:13,061
land.
Yeah.

2010
01:24:13,061 --> 01:24:14,850
They're not into anybody developing
there.

2011
01:24:14,860 --> 01:24:15,693
They're like,
no,

2012
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:17,110
no,
let's not do that.

2013
01:24:17,380 --> 01:24:21,490
It's a really wise of them,
but it's amazing that they've a managed

2014
01:24:21,491 --> 01:24:24,550
rather to go so long without being co
opted by.

2015
01:24:24,551 --> 01:24:25,420
Money,
you know?

2016
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:28,030
Yeah.
I mean that's kind of the name of the

2017
01:24:28,031 --> 01:24:28,660
game.
I mean,

2018
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:31,900
obviously we need developments because
our populations keep growing.

2019
01:24:31,901 --> 01:24:35,980
So to me it's not always realistic to
say we need to protect every piece of

2020
01:24:35,981 --> 01:24:36,160
land.

2021
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:40,180
We can protect what development we do.
We need to do it smart and make sure

2022
01:24:40,181 --> 01:24:42,520
that things are protected in the proper
places.

2023
01:24:43,060 --> 01:24:46,660
Is there any other wildlife issues in
and around this area that,

2024
01:24:46,661 --> 01:24:48,460
uh,
are being addressed right now?

2025
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:50,290
Um,
I mean that's,

2026
01:24:51,180 --> 01:24:54,730
that those are the two biggest things
going on that we're,

2027
01:24:54,731 --> 01:24:55,211
we're,
we're,

2028
01:24:55,211 --> 01:24:57,160
we're actively trying to deal with.
Um,

2029
01:24:58,420 --> 01:24:59,650
yeah,
I can't think of too many.

2030
01:24:59,651 --> 01:25:01,960
I mean there's always the little
nuisance issues that everybody's trying

2031
01:25:01,961 --> 01:25:05,710
to deal with where a coyote is in
somebodies yard or going after dogs or

2032
01:25:05,711 --> 01:25:08,500
whatever that we try to deal with.
But those are the two major ones would

2033
01:25:08,501 --> 01:25:10,230
be connectivity,
um,

2034
01:25:10,270 --> 01:25:13,270
habitat loss.
And then just poisons.

2035
01:25:13,550 --> 01:25:16,030
And are there a lot of raccoons in this
area?

2036
01:25:16,860 --> 01:25:19,120
Um,
a lot.

2037
01:25:19,690 --> 01:25:21,400
I would.
It depends what you're comparing.

2038
01:25:21,401 --> 01:25:22,720
Healthy population.
Yeah.

2039
01:25:22,721 --> 01:25:24,760
There's a decent number of raccoons if
you're comparing it to somewhere like

2040
01:25:24,761 --> 01:25:25,510
Chicago.

2041
01:25:25,510 --> 01:25:26,790
No,
we don't have goggles.

2042
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:31,580
Larger population records.
They're just much more adept there.

2043
01:25:31,590 --> 01:25:34,420
They're just the way the landscape is a
lot more mature trees,

2044
01:25:34,421 --> 01:25:36,160
mature forest,
which is what raccoons,

2045
01:25:36,161 --> 01:25:38,080
like a lot more water.
Um,

2046
01:25:38,081 --> 01:25:41,020
which are all things that attract
raccoons where we're a lot drier.

2047
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:44,770
Raccoons can occur within like our
mountains,

2048
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:48,760
but they do seem to be more focused near
roadways and some of that stuff taken

2049
01:25:48,761 --> 01:25:51,070
advantage of whatever resources are
there.

2050
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:52,570
Well,
a big garbage hunters too,

2051
01:25:52,571 --> 01:25:54,010
right?
They definitely take advantage of

2052
01:25:54,011 --> 01:25:56,080
garbage.
They'll also eat lots of fruits and

2053
01:25:56,081 --> 01:25:57,730
stuff.
So some of the scats you see in your

2054
01:25:57,731 --> 01:26:00,580
yard that you think are coyotes.
They could be raccoon as well.

2055
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:02,440
Um,
they eat a lot of berries and stuff.

2056
01:26:02,530 --> 01:26:04,580
So yeah,
I found some skunk poop.

2057
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:05,631
Real friend.
Yeah.

2058
01:26:05,631 --> 01:26:08,180
My friend who recognized the a mountain
lion poop.

2059
01:26:08,181 --> 01:26:10,190
I sent him some stuff and I said,
what is this?

2060
01:26:10,220 --> 01:26:13,460
He said that skunk poop skunks are
amazing.

2061
01:26:13,461 --> 01:26:15,980
Like I,
before I started tracking these coyotes

2062
01:26:15,981 --> 01:26:18,350
and downtown La,
I would have never thought skunks could

2063
01:26:18,351 --> 01:26:20,570
be down in that area.
There's actually a decent number of

2064
01:26:20,571 --> 01:26:22,130
skunks like in that West Lake
neighborhood.

2065
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:24,860
I could not believe how many skunks that
I smelled.

2066
01:26:24,861 --> 01:26:27,140
Skunk and Hollywood last night I was
driving through.

2067
01:26:27,141 --> 01:26:29,000
It could have been strong weed,
but I don't think it was.

2068
01:26:29,150 --> 01:26:32,630
I'm pretty sure it was an actual.
Scott was leaving the comedy store and

2069
01:26:32,631 --> 01:26:36,470
it just stunk of skunk and I was like,
how weird that these animals have

2070
01:26:36,471 --> 01:26:40,280
figured out a way to live right here in
like right near sunset.

2071
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:40,911
Yeah,
I know.

2072
01:26:40,911 --> 01:26:43,790
And they're little short legs.
Not Super Mobile,

2073
01:26:43,791 --> 01:26:46,910
but yet these stripes gunk seemed to
have figured it out.

2074
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:47,490
Yeah,
they,

2075
01:26:47,490 --> 01:26:49,210
they,
they were going after my chickens to the

2076
01:26:49,220 --> 01:26:50,300
little creeps.
Really?

2077
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:51,200
Yeah.
Yeah.

2078
01:26:51,220 --> 01:26:53,210
Dare there.
Apparently they like to eat chickens.

2079
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:54,740
That's interesting.
Yeah.

2080
01:26:54,741 --> 01:26:57,020
One night I actually had a.
We were sitting in the house,

2081
01:26:57,021 --> 01:26:59,210
me and my wife just hanging out and all
of a sudden I hear my chickens going

2082
01:26:59,211 --> 01:27:02,140
crazy out there and I'm like,
we both got up and took off running and

2083
01:27:02,141 --> 01:27:04,550
we have a lot of feral cats around our
house and I was like,

2084
01:27:04,580 --> 01:27:05,840
oh,
this thing cats are in there.

2085
01:27:05,990 --> 01:27:08,300
We go looking around.
Our chickens are flying all over the

2086
01:27:08,301 --> 01:27:11,000
yard because we hadn't gotten out and
closed the door yet because my chickens

2087
01:27:11,001 --> 01:27:13,310
can kind of free range my yard and we're
looking around.

2088
01:27:13,311 --> 01:27:15,680
We don't see anything else and I open up
the coop door and there's a big old

2089
01:27:15,681 --> 01:27:17,180
paths.
I'm just sitting there grinning at me

2090
01:27:19,460 --> 01:27:21,110
so I didn't get anything.
It didn't affect,

2091
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:23,720
didn't grab one of my chickens even
though one of my chickens was just

2092
01:27:23,721 --> 01:27:25,520
sitting there like looking at it in
squawking.

2093
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:28,550
It's like you should be doing trying.
He was trying,

2094
01:27:28,551 --> 01:27:31,160
but he just didn't.
They're not very fast.

2095
01:27:31,190 --> 01:27:32,000
They're not.
Yeah,

2096
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:35,870
they're with possums.
You like for me there another species.

2097
01:27:35,871 --> 01:27:39,050
You don't need a drug to handle agent.
Just you can just grab them up by the

2098
01:27:39,051 --> 01:27:39,860
tail.
Usually in.

2099
01:27:39,860 --> 01:27:41,240
Oh really?
Hold on to them.

2100
01:27:41,241 --> 01:27:41,730
Yeah.
No,

2101
01:27:41,730 --> 01:27:43,310
you can just run up to them and grab
them.

2102
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:45,200
People do.
There's definitely.

2103
01:27:45,201 --> 01:27:48,860
There was a guy doing his masters work
on possums and he would drive around

2104
01:27:48,861 --> 01:27:52,250
town and when he saw what he had jumped
out of his car,

2105
01:27:52,251 --> 01:27:53,540
he'd be out hanging out with his
friends.

2106
01:27:53,541 --> 01:27:56,270
You'd see a possum jump out and grab it
and cram it in his trunk.

2107
01:27:56,330 --> 01:27:58,800
Oh,
Jesus Christ throat.

2108
01:27:58,810 --> 01:27:59,840
It is trump.
Yeah.

2109
01:27:59,950 --> 01:28:03,610
That's dedication right there.
What did he do with it once you got it

2110
01:28:03,611 --> 01:28:04,800
in his trunk?
He was colored.

2111
01:28:04,910 --> 01:28:08,270
He's doing kind of like what we do here.
Trying to identify their movements and

2112
01:28:08,490 --> 01:28:10,160
what's going on with them.
What did they find out?

2113
01:28:10,161 --> 01:28:11,360
Anything unusual?
I don't know.

2114
01:28:11,361 --> 01:28:13,070
I've never saw his talk.
I wasn't like.

2115
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:16,280
I ran into him at a conference one time
and we got chatting about what he did

2116
01:28:16,281 --> 01:28:17,750
and I was like,
that's pretty hilarious.

2117
01:28:18,050 --> 01:28:20,660
It is really weird how many animals we
live around.

2118
01:28:20,780 --> 01:28:22,160
I mean,
it's really weird.

2119
01:28:22,190 --> 01:28:25,820
There's so many different and such a
wide variety,

2120
01:28:25,940 --> 01:28:27,950
especially when it comes to birds.
You know?

2121
01:28:27,951 --> 01:28:30,630
One thing that I see a lot of is,
well,

2122
01:28:30,700 --> 01:28:32,990
there's a lot of hawks in my
neighborhood and we did this thing in

2123
01:28:32,991 --> 01:28:37,670
our backyard where we had a a wrought
iron fence and we changed part of it and

2124
01:28:37,671 --> 01:28:42,650
put a glass fence and these hawks hadn't
figured it out and they would swoop down

2125
01:28:42,651 --> 01:28:44,570
and slammed into the fence headfirst.

2126
01:28:44,630 --> 01:28:47,880
We got quite a few of these poor hawks.
Yeah,

2127
01:28:47,910 --> 01:28:48,980
I can imagine.
Yeah,

2128
01:28:49,220 --> 01:28:54,220
but it's just amazing how many you find
out there and how many predators and

2129
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:56,630
there's the occasional golden eagle in
this area too,

2130
01:28:56,631 --> 01:28:58,760
right?
We get reports of them coming through

2131
01:28:58,761 --> 01:28:59,900
every once in a while.
Yeah.

2132
01:29:00,110 --> 01:29:03,180
It's not rare by any means are super
common by any means,

2133
01:29:03,181 --> 01:29:05,460
but they come through now and when you
say,

2134
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:08,400
how would one know whether or not you're
looking at a Golden Eagle?

2135
01:29:08,401 --> 01:29:10,290
It's just because it's really big.
It's really big.

2136
01:29:10,291 --> 01:29:12,540
There's some other little
characteristics that I'm not as good

2137
01:29:12,541 --> 01:29:14,400
with,
but they're significantly larger than

2138
01:29:14,401 --> 01:29:16,530
like the red tills,
which would be the one you'd be most

2139
01:29:16,531 --> 01:29:18,720
likely to confuse it with?
Yeah,

2140
01:29:18,930 --> 01:29:23,730
just the wide variety of different
raptors and these.

2141
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:24,411
Yeah,
it's,

2142
01:29:24,411 --> 01:29:26,630
it's amazing.
I mean red shouldered hawks once smile

2143
01:29:26,660 --> 01:29:28,980
will be traveling for bobcat and we'll
catch a red shouldered hawk on our

2144
01:29:28,981 --> 01:29:29,814
traps.

2145
01:29:29,980 --> 01:29:30,781
It's like,
oh,

2146
01:29:30,781 --> 01:29:32,850
this is so cool.
We've even caught a great horned owl

2147
01:29:32,851 --> 01:29:36,450
once and so it's pretty neat seeing some
of these animals up close.

2148
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:38,670
Yeah,
I'm worried that the owls in my

2149
01:29:38,671 --> 01:29:42,420
neighborhood had been poisoned because I
used to have quite a few of them and

2150
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:46,440
used to hear them all the time.
It used to hear them hooting all the

2151
01:29:46,441 --> 01:29:49,800
time and one time I went out on my back
porch and there was one sitting on the

2152
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:53,940
fence and it was huge.
I mean I don't know how big it really

2153
01:29:53,941 --> 01:29:55,800
was because I'm sure it was kind of
freaked out by it,

2154
01:29:55,830 --> 01:29:57,210
but I,
I was shocked.

2155
01:29:57,360 --> 01:30:00,660
It was at least two feet tall and it was
just sitting on his back.

2156
01:30:00,710 --> 01:30:02,160
I mean,
at least that tall.

2157
01:30:02,180 --> 01:30:03,630
I mean,
no exaggeration,

2158
01:30:03,631 --> 01:30:05,690
but it looked like it was like four feet
tall.

2159
01:30:05,691 --> 01:30:06,870
It looked,
it looked.

2160
01:30:06,870 --> 01:30:10,280
I couldn't believe how big it looked.
Great personalities are huge.

2161
01:30:10,530 --> 01:30:11,280
Huge.
Yeah.

2162
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:15,870
I think they can carry away foxes to
study in Bakersfield that they've

2163
01:30:15,871 --> 01:30:19,050
documented and house coming down,
grabbing the kit boxes and carrying them

2164
01:30:19,051 --> 01:30:21,900
up to their nest sites.
I had a video on instagram.

2165
01:30:21,990 --> 01:30:25,020
It's still up there that I got online of
this.

2166
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:29,310
A owl swooping down and jacking a hawk
and it's next.

2167
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:30,630
No.
Have you ever seen that?

2168
01:30:30,660 --> 01:30:32,460
I haven't,
but I've heard about it.

2169
01:30:32,461 --> 01:30:37,461
My one of my coworkers actually as a
falconer and he when he released or what

2170
01:30:37,621 --> 01:30:40,290
did he do?
One of his Hawk's got away from him and

2171
01:30:40,291 --> 01:30:42,600
he said the tree was as being swarmed by
grade horns.

2172
01:30:42,601 --> 01:30:44,250
He stayed there all night trying to keep
the.

2173
01:30:44,910 --> 01:30:47,520
Trying to help his hawk stay alive.
No kidding.

2174
01:30:47,550 --> 01:30:50,190
Now he's crazy.
Owls eat hawks.

2175
01:30:50,191 --> 01:30:52,050
Yeah.
I didn't know that until he was telling

2176
01:30:52,051 --> 01:30:52,470
me that.

2177
01:30:52,470 --> 01:30:53,430
I'm like,
that's crazy.

2178
01:30:53,431 --> 01:30:54,670
I mean,
great horns are huge though.

2179
01:30:54,710 --> 01:30:56,920
Check out this video because it's really
nuts.

2180
01:30:58,240 --> 01:30:59,840
Do you know how long I was?
Legs,

2181
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:04,200
legs.
Never seen that before that.

2182
01:31:04,290 --> 01:31:06,780
That's crazy.
Hard to find something even close to it,

2183
01:31:06,781 --> 01:31:08,760
but wow.
Yeah,

2184
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:10,620
they're amazing.
I got a,

2185
01:31:10,621 --> 01:31:12,750
I worked at cal State Bakersfield in
there.

2186
01:31:12,751 --> 01:31:14,860
They had a raptor rehab thing and I got
the handle.

2187
01:31:14,861 --> 01:31:16,920
Great horned owls.
When those guys flap their wings,

2188
01:31:16,921 --> 01:31:18,420
it's like,
whoa.

2189
01:31:18,870 --> 01:31:21,630
It was pretty crazy.
I comparable to the the Golden Eagle,

2190
01:31:21,631 --> 01:31:23,490
the Golden Eagles.
Definitely more powerful,

2191
01:31:23,491 --> 01:31:27,440
but the goal of the long or the great
horned owls were pretty amazing.

2192
01:31:27,780 --> 01:31:31,680
Our perception of them is so interesting
because they're a serious predator,

2193
01:31:31,860 --> 01:31:34,830
but most people don't think of an owl as
a predator.

2194
01:31:34,831 --> 01:31:39,831
They just think of them as some wise
forest creature that gives advice on

2195
01:31:40,230 --> 01:31:42,810
fire.
They're obviously not a threat to you or

2196
01:31:42,811 --> 01:31:45,000
me,
but obviously your cat,

2197
01:31:45,060 --> 01:31:46,780
they could potentially grow 100 percent.

2198
01:31:46,790 --> 01:31:48,760
Right,
and who knows?

2199
01:31:48,761 --> 01:31:50,850
Those people get smaller and smaller.
Dog.

2200
01:31:50,851 --> 01:31:53,160
Watch this because you see the eyes and
the distance.

2201
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:55,710
See the eyes.
Check this out.

2202
01:31:56,610 --> 01:31:59,950
I love this video being,
wow,

2203
01:32:00,790 --> 01:32:02,530
the other arc doesn't even know what
happened.

2204
01:32:02,860 --> 01:32:03,693
He's like,
what's up?

2205
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:05,680
What's going on?
What's was that when a man.

2206
01:32:05,860 --> 01:32:07,870
Is that a juvenile?
I do not know.

2207
01:32:08,290 --> 01:32:09,820
I don't know.
They look a little fuzzy.

2208
01:32:10,030 --> 01:32:11,560
Yeah,
they do a little bit right.

2209
01:32:11,810 --> 01:32:14,720
Especially the one in the back,
the one that gets jacked act.

2210
01:32:14,770 --> 01:32:16,780
Wow.
But the way it gets jacked,

2211
01:32:16,781 --> 01:32:17,411
it's like,
boy,

2212
01:32:17,411 --> 01:32:19,420
that thing's dead before it leaves the
nest.

2213
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:22,990
Those claws and towns are so gigantic.
They are.

2214
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:25,000
They're amazing.
That's kind of why we want them around.

2215
01:32:25,010 --> 01:32:28,870
Right.
Rabbits and rats and everything else and

2216
01:32:28,890 --> 01:32:30,510
also because they're cool.
Yeah.

2217
01:32:30,580 --> 01:32:32,290
Yeah.
I mean now I think that's a big thing

2218
01:32:32,291 --> 01:32:36,730
about coyotes too and I,
I wish some of these short sided folks

2219
01:32:37,060 --> 01:32:39,790
that don't want them around because
they're worried that they're going to

2220
01:32:39,791 --> 01:32:41,740
get their dog and all this different
stuff.

2221
01:32:41,740 --> 01:32:42,670
Like,
man,

2222
01:32:42,671 --> 01:32:45,850
we're really lucky that we can see these
things.

2223
01:32:45,851 --> 01:32:47,830
I mean,
nature is cool.

2224
01:32:47,831 --> 01:32:49,460
It's cool to see.
Yeah,

2225
01:32:49,550 --> 01:32:51,640
well that's amazing now being in
downtown La,

2226
01:32:51,641 --> 01:32:52,960
but a lot of these people that live down
there,

2227
01:32:52,961 --> 01:32:55,090
they don't ever get to see wildlife
right now.

2228
01:32:55,091 --> 01:32:57,310
All of A.
suddenly there's this medium sized

2229
01:32:57,340 --> 01:32:59,530
carnivore running around their
neighborhoods that they get to see and

2230
01:32:59,531 --> 01:33:00,500
some people.
I mean,

2231
01:33:00,970 --> 01:33:03,150
it's funny,
I talked to one person that's like

2232
01:33:03,670 --> 01:33:05,830
scared to death of this thing and the
next person's like,

2233
01:33:05,831 --> 01:33:07,570
it's the coolest thing they've ever seen
in their life.

2234
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:09,610
Right.
And it's always that balancing act.

2235
01:33:09,611 --> 01:33:10,510
I mean I,
to me,

2236
01:33:10,511 --> 01:33:12,220
I've always been pretty fascinated with
them.

2237
01:33:12,490 --> 01:33:14,980
Yeah,
I identify more with the people think

2238
01:33:14,981 --> 01:33:15,880
it's cool.
It's just,

2239
01:33:15,881 --> 01:33:18,100
it's really like we,
we're talking about,

2240
01:33:18,101 --> 01:33:22,540
we're really lucky we live in a very
unique area in that we have this big

2241
01:33:22,541 --> 01:33:25,510
city,
huge city and then just outside of it we

2242
01:33:25,511 --> 01:33:29,890
have all this wildlife,
like real legit wildlife you can get

2243
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:34,220
from downtown La to 100 percent
wilderness in an hour.

2244
01:33:34,980 --> 01:33:36,220
That's crazy.
They were less,

2245
01:33:36,221 --> 01:33:37,360
I mean,
yeah,

2246
01:33:37,361 --> 01:33:40,360
you can get into Santa Monica.
It's pretty quickly from those spots in

2247
01:33:40,361 --> 01:33:42,700
La and it's,
you get in there and it's pretty

2248
01:33:42,701 --> 01:33:43,990
amazing.
Well listen man,

2249
01:33:43,991 --> 01:33:47,770
I really appreciate you coming on here
and sharing all your information and

2250
01:33:47,830 --> 01:33:50,350
educating us on this stuff.
It's super cool and thanks for

2251
01:33:50,351 --> 01:33:51,730
everything you do.
And,

2252
01:33:51,731 --> 01:33:52,210
uh,
it's just,

2253
01:33:52,210 --> 01:33:55,480
it's really interesting that you get to
share all this stuff that you're

2254
01:33:55,481 --> 01:33:57,370
learning about these things.
They appreciate it,

2255
01:33:57,371 --> 01:33:59,500
man.
Thanks for having folks.

2256
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:03,400
We'll be back tomorrow with my pal out.
Magical.

2257
01:34:03,430 --> 01:34:03,940
See that.
