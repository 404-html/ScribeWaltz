1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:01,500
Did you,
did you,

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,670
did you do

3
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:07,970
Shane Moss,
ladies and gentlemen from our studio in

4
00:00:07,971 --> 00:00:09,170
beautiful eight,
one eight.

5
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,330
Thanks for having me.
Thanks for coming buddy.

6
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,310
Yeah,
I was saying before the show you have

7
00:00:13,311 --> 00:00:15,740
the Duncan trussell seal of approval.
Yeah,

8
00:00:15,741 --> 00:00:17,560
thanks Duncan.
Yeah.

9
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:18,560
Yeah.
I just had my,

10
00:00:18,561 --> 00:00:20,870
uh,
my second time on his show recently.

11
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,830
Oh yeah.
Awesome dude.

12
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,740
He's,
he's one of the rarest people I've ever

13
00:00:24,741 --> 00:00:27,360
met in my life.
I don't know anyone like that now.

14
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:31,640
There's a few guys that I know that is
just a stone cold,

15
00:00:31,641 --> 00:00:34,760
original.
Duncan's one of those.

16
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:35,670
Yeah,
he's hilarious.

17
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,620
Awesome.
Did He,

18
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,210
did he give you the full virtual reality
experience?

19
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,150
I did.
That stuff's amazing.

20
00:00:41,151 --> 00:00:44,150
I can't let any.
He told me that the porn is really crazy

21
00:00:44,151 --> 00:00:45,950
in it too,
but he didn't show me any of the point.

22
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,280
Gave me close to the porn.
He gave me the headset like judy got.

23
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:50,301
No,
no.

24
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:52,220
I got right up to the wall.
I'm like,

25
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,520
I'm not going.
I'm not going into the matrix.

26
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:56,870
Yeah,
I hit.

27
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:01,670
I hit like a wall in his room,
like shooting or dodging a thing or

28
00:01:01,671 --> 00:01:04,670
whatever it is.
It is exceptionally realistic.

29
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:08,230
It's incredible.
Did you do the archery game where they.

30
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,070
The little guys?
Yeah.

31
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,920
Yeah.
There's another art tree one that I

32
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:15,090
played to.
That was A.

33
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,160
Yeah.
That's awesome.

34
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:20,560
There's one that you had to an archery
game where you had to dodge like and

35
00:01:20,561 --> 00:01:23,530
you're like moving like the Matrix to
dodge away from there.

36
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,030
It was like a.
It was like a good workout.

37
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,720
Can see the arrows.
Yeah,

38
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:28,300
yeah,
yeah,

39
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:28,881
yeah.
No,

40
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:32,060
I would imagine it is a good workout
because I did his boxing one and that's

41
00:01:32,061 --> 00:01:34,490
a good workout.
You look boxing against this guy,

42
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,340
this video guy and I showed it to some
fighters and I was like,

43
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,690
I really think that this could be an
amazing training tool if they could

44
00:01:41,691 --> 00:01:46,691
figure out how to make the headset so
that maybe for the cord was in the back.

45
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,700
If it didn't interfere as long as you
didn't do anything where you had to spin

46
00:01:49,701 --> 00:01:51,800
around,
it would probably be effective,

47
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:55,610
but it can.
They can map your body movements like

48
00:01:55,611 --> 00:01:56,990
they had that Jamie,
you'd notice that,

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,480
um,
wasn't there an xbox one,

50
00:01:59,481 --> 00:02:03,110
we're just sort of takes a picture of
your body as you're standing there,

51
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:07,980
connect had this fixed before the show
and you got to connect.

52
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:11,040
Can,
it can read your like heat body heat.

53
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,450
It can pick up,
sort.

54
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,770
Not like,
it's not reading your skeleton,

55
00:02:13,771 --> 00:02:17,460
but it can pick up your limbs and stuff
so it picks up the length of your lens

56
00:02:17,461 --> 00:02:18,540
as well,
where they're moving.

57
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:19,450
Like if you do the,
uh,

58
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,960
insanity or something like that,
that will work out.

59
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,840
It can tell how high you're lifting your
knees up and if you're not bringing them

60
00:02:24,841 --> 00:02:27,030
up to the right level,
it'll tell you like bring them up

61
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:28,220
higher,
lift your legs higher level.

62
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,380
Wow.
High enough.

63
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,950
Like give you points based on how you're
doing and whatnot.

64
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,550
Obviously this is rudimentary in
comparison to what it's going to be in a

65
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,330
few years.
So yeah.

66
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,700
And with police training and stuff like
that,

67
00:02:40,701 --> 00:02:43,400
especially once,
I don't know exactly how they do it,

68
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:47,240
but once it's like kind of wireless.
So you don't have the cord attached to

69
00:02:47,241 --> 00:02:52,160
you and then maybe you could have like
larger facilities than just a small room

70
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,130
eventually.
And,

71
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,023
and,
uh,

72
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,510
doing that,
didn't you say that we're already doing

73
00:02:56,511 --> 00:02:57,770
that.
They're doing warehouses,

74
00:02:57,771 --> 00:03:00,040
they're setting up warehouses for VR VR

75
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,450
sets and they're going to have feedback
in the warehouses like,

76
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,830
like fans that blow a wind on you and is
going to be like movement and some parts

77
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:11,310
of the ground.
Some shit.

78
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,331
Yeah.
I've,

79
00:03:12,331 --> 00:03:13,480
I played,
um,

80
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:18,190
I played one of the ones was a paintball
one with other people that were online

81
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,610
and um,
I mean I guess we've had kind of,

82
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,440
people have been playing other people
online,

83
00:03:23,441 --> 00:03:25,300
but when you're doing it in virtual
reality,

84
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:27,940
it's just a totally different thing.
Well,

85
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:31,480
I can only imagine.
I saw there was one that they had these

86
00:03:31,481 --> 00:03:34,690
people on an omnidirectional treadmill.
Have you seen those?

87
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,160
No.
You sit,

88
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:40,570
I can get the idea that you're in a
circular containment and you have like a

89
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:44,170
harness on your waist so you don't ever
walk forward and touch the bars.

90
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:46,000
Right?
So you're kind of strapped in place.

91
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:51,180
And then your feet dictate which way.
This surface that you're on spins,

92
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,530
it's like a,
it's a treadmill,

93
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,440
but it's not a treadmill like it's
always going.

94
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,120
So you have to keep up with it.
It's a treadmill that you propel,

95
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,430
which I've seen before.
Some people actually liked those.

96
00:04:00,431 --> 00:04:04,530
They put them on like a serious incline
and they do crazy sprints on these.

97
00:04:04,531 --> 00:04:07,750
A self propelling,
self moving treadmills.

98
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,620
So this guy had this.
Oh here.

99
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,570
Is that it?
Yeah,

100
00:04:10,571 --> 00:04:12,700
there it is.
There's the omnidirectional treadmill.

101
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,890
So they got to see how he's hooked up to
this harness.

102
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:19,180
So he's in the center of it and it seems
to spin on bearings or something.

103
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,860
And so he's moving like literally moving
through this,

104
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:29,490
this virtual world.
You could have just enormous landscapes

105
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,070
that play out.
That's amazing.

106
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,070
Yeah thing.
Yeah,

107
00:04:36,071 --> 00:04:37,600
people are going to get lost in there.

108
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,840
You're also going to get really fucking
tired because I'll tell you what,

109
00:04:40,841 --> 00:04:45,841
like playing that archery game,
my arms were so tired just from holding

110
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,660
like it's like a static thing with your
left arm and particularly you're holding

111
00:04:49,661 --> 00:04:52,960
your arm in one position and then your
right arm that you're drawn the

112
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,630
bowstring back.
You're holding that in one position,

113
00:04:55,631 --> 00:04:58,090
like constantly game is like 20 minutes
long.

114
00:04:58,091 --> 00:05:01,180
Did he do the paint brush stuff?
I did not.

115
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:03,010
I only did two things.
I did the boxing one.

116
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,810
Well I did three.
I did the boxing one.

117
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,070
I did the archery one than I did the one
where you just stand there and the whale

118
00:05:09,071 --> 00:05:14,071
comes up to you saying,
well the paint stuff I think is going to

119
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:17,470
be.
I think that is one that's kind of like

120
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,710
almost there already as far as how good
it is.

121
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,390
You know that the archery one,
it's like,

122
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,660
oh these little like two dimensional
kind of things that are,

123
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,500
you know,
it's not,

124
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,500
it's not like amazing graphics.
I think that was amazing though,

125
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,810
but.
But it will be a lot better in the

126
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:33,210
future,
but the paint one is,

127
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:38,250
is just this virtual paint.
When you paint like you use a spray can

128
00:05:38,441 --> 00:05:41,340
hear,
like you put sparks in this area and

129
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:44,740
then you can like walk through it,
you can make a circle around yourself

130
00:05:44,741 --> 00:05:48,250
and then walk through it and shrink it
and enlarge it and you can see all these

131
00:05:48,251 --> 00:05:52,600
people that have like painted entire
ships like spaceships that you can then

132
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:57,601
go inside and walk around and see all
the different areas they've made and

133
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,010
you can add your own graffiti to it and
stuff like that.

134
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,570
I think that's going to be like to have
someone like Alex grey or something like

135
00:06:05,571 --> 00:06:06,470
that.
Get in there,

136
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:07,820
you know?
Yeah.

137
00:06:07,821 --> 00:06:09,970
I saw a,
I saw a demonstration of that.

138
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,760
Or they're doing it in three dimensional
deal.

139
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,580
It's going,
this guy made something like you're

140
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:18,581
describing as for little different rooms
that he has within the little.

141
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:22,580
Uh,
the virtual world is a big room.

142
00:06:22,581 --> 00:06:24,560
You have,
you made for little ones than the.

143
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:28,130
And these are all little paint things
that you could make using the program.

144
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:32,360
And what a program is he on this call?
It's on vive.

145
00:06:32,361 --> 00:06:34,250
It's called tilt brush.
Does the actual program.

146
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,770
Did you know the guy who invented
oculus?

147
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,520
There's only like 24.
Yeah.

148
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,650
Did you hear about the stuff going on
with them this weekend?

149
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,770
He's a trump supporter and his
girlfriend's a Gamer.

150
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:49,790
Gator paid like billion dollar million
dollar girlfriend.

151
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:50,893
Hold on.
What'd he say?

152
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,620
He paid for a fund that funded those
memes.

153
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:58,220
Like the trump memes.
There's a meme.

154
00:06:58,221 --> 00:06:59,054
Funny.
Yeah,

155
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,860
I'll look it up while we're talking.
We're talking about.

156
00:07:00,861 --> 00:07:03,440
Yeah,
that's hilarious.

157
00:07:03,441 --> 00:07:05,660
There's a strange world that we're in
here.

158
00:07:05,661 --> 00:07:07,430
Thinks his name,
something like Palmer Luckey.

159
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,660
Does that sound right?
Oh,

160
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,760
okay.
How weird.

161
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:15,910
I'm a meme fund that seems so counter
like it was more effective than the

162
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:23,820
commercials they put on TV.
Probably everyone on facebook and

163
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:29,090
especially because facebook's kind of
like a lot of older people are on there

164
00:07:29,091 --> 00:07:34,091
now and they're real suckers for those.
Like I like America share this.

165
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,560
If you're brave enough
to share it.

166
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,990
There's a lot of that going around.
It's like those old letters that like

167
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:50,210
when I was a kid,
the chain letters had come and if you

168
00:07:50,211 --> 00:07:53,780
didn't send it to like seven people,
you'd have bad luck or you know,

169
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:54,580
whatever it is.

170
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,770
And now people are falling for that with
like trump memes.

171
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,220
Are you aware of shit posting?
No.

172
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,270
Okay.
Jamie.

173
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:07,420
Jamie alerted me to this new thing.
Jamie's already interests catchy name.

174
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,640
I'm old.
So I need Jamie to keep me in touch with

175
00:08:10,641 --> 00:08:12,220
the young folk.
Um,

176
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:16,260
but there's a thing called shit posting
and which shit posting is a,

177
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,980
correct me if I'm wrong,
but it's part of the alt right.

178
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,730
Correct.
Is that how it's not necessarily they do

179
00:08:22,731 --> 00:08:23,850
it,
but I don't think it has to end.

180
00:08:23,851 --> 00:08:24,830
It's not,
it's not,

181
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,840
doesn't have an affiliation.
So the,

182
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:31,841
but the idea is you just posting a bunch
of ridiculous shit like just to do it

183
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,870
right.
And you maybe your intelligence level,

184
00:08:35,871 --> 00:08:40,280
maybe several steps above the stuff
you're posting and you're kind of half

185
00:08:40,281 --> 00:08:44,470
trolling and being shitty at the same
time before the idea to form a trolling,

186
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:45,830
trolling,
taking the new.

187
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,720
It's a new turn.
The but by the same,

188
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,810
by the same shit posting like you know,
it's shit.

189
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,540
Is that the idea behind it?
The value of what you're posting is

190
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:54,374
shit.
Right?

191
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,630
The description,
right.

192
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,250
That

193
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,930
you're aware of it when you're doing it
right.

194
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,170
That's why it's like trolling yet and so
the idea is just to rile people up who

195
00:09:02,171 --> 00:09:03,810
were like Hillary supporters or
something.

196
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:09,480
Huh?
This is the most bizarre political event

197
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:12,210
I can ever remember in my life is too
much.

198
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,570
I don't handle it well.
I try to not watch the news and stuff

199
00:09:16,571 --> 00:09:18,220
and it's still just so pervasive.
You have

200
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,300
to watch it.
I know.

201
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,420
It's like a sports that you have to
follow.

202
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,880
It's like a sporting event you have to
follow.

203
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,080
There was a video that a bunch of
celebrities put out that is so god damn

204
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:33,081
confusing because it's celebrities
telling you to go out and vote and

205
00:09:33,511 --> 00:09:37,980
they're showing all this stuff that
makes both of them look fucking

206
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:39,960
terrible.
It's such a confusing video because

207
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:44,961
there's all this stuff about Bengazi,
all this stuff about like the Hillary

208
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,460
Clinton scandals,
the various scandals is playing on in

209
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:52,461
the background while I'm ironman fuck's
named Robert Downey jr talks and then a

210
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:58,530
bunch of other celebrities talk and some
of them are like really ridiculous,

211
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:01,590
like some of them were starting to cry
when they're talking.

212
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,450
This is so important.

213
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:08,570
Being a part of that decision,
I might think it's not important.

214
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,450
I think you are not important,
but that's not true and the only one,

215
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,570
but there's another version of this that
has.

216
00:10:14,571 --> 00:10:16,790
Okay.
Maybe maybe this is different.

217
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,900
I think I've been hoodwinked.
I think this is probably the real one

218
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,220
because it says save the day and the
channel saved the day and the other one

219
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:28,730
is someone.
Someone made it and took their speeches

220
00:10:28,731 --> 00:10:32,060
with some of their imagery,
but then put a bunch of stuff in the

221
00:10:32,061 --> 00:10:36,710
background showing like how fucked up
the Benghazi situation is.

222
00:10:36,711 --> 00:10:40,820
How fucked up Donald Trump's past is,
how many people are suing trump

223
00:10:40,821 --> 00:10:45,821
university and then it all.
So it makes this thing about saving the

224
00:10:45,951 --> 00:10:49,870
day.
I guess most of what saved the day is is

225
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,930
like anti-trump,
but when you see the video that whoever

226
00:10:53,931 --> 00:10:57,440
has created this put together online,
it shows a lot of fucked up hillary

227
00:10:57,441 --> 00:11:00,110
stuff too.
It's really lets you know like,

228
00:11:00,111 --> 00:11:01,580
hey,
you ain't saving shit stupid.

229
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:07,590
We're the other.
It's changing this culture and memes and

230
00:11:07,821 --> 00:11:08,530
everything else.
It's,

231
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:13,070
it's completely changing what the role
of politicians is,

232
00:11:13,071 --> 00:11:16,160
what the,
what the president actually does.

233
00:11:16,161 --> 00:11:19,940
Whereas it used to be like you'd need a
representative to ride on horseback or

234
00:11:19,941 --> 00:11:23,150
whatever and and now it's.
We don't really need any of that

235
00:11:23,151 --> 00:11:24,500
anymore.
And so now it's just,

236
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:28,370
these are just people that are going
around giving pep talks because by

237
00:11:28,371 --> 00:11:31,880
necessity they have to raise a certain
amount of money so they have to go to

238
00:11:31,881 --> 00:11:34,670
each town and say,
America,

239
00:11:34,671 --> 00:11:37,940
I liked America the most.
The other guy doesn't like America the

240
00:11:37,941 --> 00:11:41,330
best and I support the troops the most.
The other person doesn't and they're

241
00:11:41,331 --> 00:11:44,270
just giving the same talk and every.
They're not actually.

242
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:47,600
I don't know how much,
how they could have any time to actually

243
00:11:47,601 --> 00:11:49,790
be doing the job.
You know,

244
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:53,230
they're just going around marketing and
it's kind of by necessity and how about

245
00:11:53,231 --> 00:11:54,064
when they have,

246
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:57,190
when they're marketing and they have
another job already,

247
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,920
like they're already a senator or
something like that and they don't,

248
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,860
they don't give up the job,
they just start campaigning.

249
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,950
Like when the camp,
when the president was campaigning for

250
00:12:05,951 --> 00:12:10,060
reelection,
like a good percentage of him working

251
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:13,270
with him,
doing his job was him campaigning to do

252
00:12:13,271 --> 00:12:18,160
it again.
That's what the fuck that's.

253
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,050
And it's getting earlier and earlier
too.

254
00:12:20,051 --> 00:12:21,880
So we'll,
we'll be done what we've been hearing

255
00:12:21,881 --> 00:12:26,560
about this for like two years now and
then after the election we'll maybe get

256
00:12:26,561 --> 00:12:30,430
like maybe a year break before they'll
start in on what the,

257
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:34,720
what the next election cycle is going to
be and everyone thinking this is very

258
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:38,410
important and very exciting and it's
time to change things.

259
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,380
Very important.
I don't have a solution,

260
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:46,500
but I do have a question like,
wouldn't it be better for everybody if

261
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,440
you couldn't advertise better for
everybody if you also couldn't pay

262
00:12:53,201 --> 00:12:57,760
people to put promos up or posters up,
if that was completely off the table.

263
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,320
Like maybe you could say,
listen,

264
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:00,154
okay,
here's the deal.

265
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:03,220
People can support your campaign.
You know,

266
00:13:03,221 --> 00:13:05,230
they can,
they can get behind you,

267
00:13:05,231 --> 00:13:07,750
they can endorse you,
but no ads.

268
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,471
Yeah.
Yeah.

269
00:13:08,471 --> 00:13:12,250
Like we need a cultural spam filter.
Yeah.

270
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:17,400
Because now even if these people
genuinely say it's just this person who

271
00:13:17,741 --> 00:13:21,790
genuinely wants to make a difference as
super smart that they know just how to

272
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,980
do the job,
they won't be able to write.

273
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,840
They have to.
They have to go out.

274
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,730
Yeah.
Obama's very bright dude.

275
00:13:27,731 --> 00:13:30,460
Seems like a hard working guy,
but he's still,

276
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,560
you know,
he's just out there giving pep talks and

277
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:33,960
having to,
you know,

278
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:38,080
raise funds and I think it's ridiculous
to try to pretend that one person is

279
00:13:38,081 --> 00:13:40,450
even capable of running the United
States government.

280
00:13:40,451 --> 00:13:44,800
Something so monstrously huge
encompassing the irs,

281
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,240
the CIA,
the NSA,

282
00:13:46,241 --> 00:13:51,241
the FBI fucking garage down the line
with every union and all the different

283
00:13:51,371 --> 00:13:54,360
special interest groups that he has to
know.

284
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,200
They,
they all contribute to his campaign.

285
00:13:56,201 --> 00:13:58,570
He has to help them out.
There's just so many different people as

286
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:01,000
to me from other countries.
There's so many different foreign

287
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:03,970
interests he has to address.
There's so many different deals that are

288
00:14:03,971 --> 00:14:06,310
on the table.
How the fuck could he.

289
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:11,460
It's like having 100 jobs and why not?
Rather than going to each small town and

290
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:14,440
giving the same speech.
I mean we have the Internet,

291
00:14:14,441 --> 00:14:18,370
we have TV.
Why not just get together and have like

292
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:23,200
a podcast or like once a week where you
just talk about what you're doing and

293
00:14:23,201 --> 00:14:26,270
what your plans are and you're shooting,
you're getting together with certain W,

294
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:31,860
whatever experts you're working with and
giving a summary on what's actually

295
00:14:32,021 --> 00:14:37,021
happening and how things work so people
are involved and understand and can give

296
00:14:37,151 --> 00:14:42,151
feedback on it rather than 100 percent.
I mean that's because right now there's

297
00:14:43,061 --> 00:14:44,490
just no substance and even.

298
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,350
I used to think that debate,
the debates were like,

299
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:48,371
oh,
okay.

300
00:14:48,371 --> 00:14:52,250
Finally there they're going to be
something.

301
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,170
You know,
they're a of substance,

302
00:14:54,171 --> 00:14:56,750
but it's just you have one person on one
side,

303
00:14:56,751 --> 00:15:01,130
one on the other in and they're just
digging their trenches and they're not

304
00:15:01,131 --> 00:15:04,310
open to the other person's idea.
They're not having a conversation like,

305
00:15:04,311 --> 00:15:09,311
I wish I wish someone would just make
these two children just sit down and

306
00:15:09,351 --> 00:15:14,250
have a fucking conversation over over
tea or something like that.

307
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,620
Because all they're trying to do is
when,

308
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,360
yeah,
that's really what they're trying to do.

309
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,850
Trying to employ the best strategy for
success.

310
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,060
They're going to figure out a way to get
in that fucking White House.

311
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,240
Yeah.
It's just so stressful.

312
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:28,610
It's so strange and it goes along the
same lines to me is there's some certain

313
00:15:28,611 --> 00:15:31,820
things that have been around for a long
time that I'm like,

314
00:15:31,821 --> 00:15:33,950
how did they ever let this get in?

315
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,340
Like if you are operating for the
greater good of the people,

316
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:40,640
not for the most amount of money that
you're going to receive for making these

317
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:43,280
decisions,
but if you're operating for the greater

318
00:15:43,281 --> 00:15:46,430
good of the people,
why would you let pharmaceutical drug

319
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:50,420
companies make advertisements?
Why would you let politicians make

320
00:15:50,421 --> 00:15:53,840
advertisements?
Why would you let all the cigarette

321
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:56,540
industry?
How the fuck is that still around?

322
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,340
Yeah.
How?

323
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,320
Hi,
how are you still allowing that and then

324
00:16:00,321 --> 00:16:02,060
you're saying that marijuana should be
illegal.

325
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:05,960
I mean there's so many of these ancient
things that are so ridiculous that had

326
00:16:05,961 --> 00:16:07,160
been around forever.
Well,

327
00:16:07,161 --> 00:16:09,780
and then things like the dea,
which just a.

328
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,020
What was that three weeks ago when they
decided what?

329
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:15,650
They weren't going to reschedule it even
though everything's going that direction

330
00:16:15,651 --> 00:16:19,730
clearly and everything.
There's nothing pointing the other

331
00:16:19,731 --> 00:16:20,531
direction,
right?

332
00:16:20,531 --> 00:16:21,140
There's no.

333
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,010
There's not like,
well,

334
00:16:22,011 --> 00:16:26,420
we have some conflicting studies and it
looks like marijuana could possibly do

335
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,240
some sort of memory damage or this or
that.

336
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,113
No,
there's none of that.

337
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,440
Yeah.
It's just,

338
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,270
it's,
it's kind of like.

339
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,320
I remember the gay marriage debate.
It's like 10 years ago it was just like,

340
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,780
I don't care if you're the most
homophobic,

341
00:16:38,781 --> 00:16:41,120
you have your religious beliefs or
whatever it is,

342
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:44,930
but.
But the inability to see that this is

343
00:16:44,931 --> 00:16:47,720
happening,
that this is where it's going and you're

344
00:16:47,721 --> 00:16:52,721
just wasting a lot of time on a losing
battle is kind of troubling that people

345
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:57,530
aren't able to look at society and be
able to make better predictions.

346
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,930
Well,
they got caught up in a lot of it is

347
00:16:59,931 --> 00:17:03,410
religious.
A giant percentage of it is the beliefs

348
00:17:03,411 --> 00:17:07,190
that people have about key people that
are based on whatever religion they grew

349
00:17:07,191 --> 00:17:08,024
up with.

350
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,000
It's the only reason why you would care
nipple.

351
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,770
We're agnostic.
I guarantee you if you like,

352
00:17:12,771 --> 00:17:17,771
did some sort of a survey and checked
atheist versus pick whatever religious

353
00:17:17,961 --> 00:17:21,770
designation and saw which ones were
against gay marriage,

354
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:24,120
it would be almost all of them.
The religious ones.

355
00:17:24,121 --> 00:17:27,650
So there's no like there's no secular
argument against it.

356
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:29,360
The only argument against that is,
look,

357
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:32,090
you fucking people got it.
Light Gay folk style.

358
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,770
Don't get married,
don't do it.

359
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:37,930
Like you can't get pregnant.
They can't rope you in illegally.

360
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,460
Entangled to some other dude that you
might get tired of blowing.

361
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,373
Okay.
Yeah,

362
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,490
just,
just,

363
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,280
just don't buy into it.
It's kind of like A.

364
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,450
I feel that way about some of the,
um,

365
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:53,010
when,
when they celebrate like Jessica Jones

366
00:17:53,011 --> 00:17:56,940
or something like that where a sec.
Finally there's like a strong female

367
00:17:56,941 --> 00:17:59,400
leader and it's like,
it was Jessica Jones.

368
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:03,570
It's a TV show on Netflix,
like one of those comic book TV show.

369
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:07,730
It's just the idea of how dare you think
we should know that fee.

370
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,410
Been some new store.
They're like up epo or whatever it was.

371
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:16,140
John's capital.
Siri fucked up and he didn't know what

372
00:18:16,141 --> 00:18:18,930
it was.
But the idea of have like a strong

373
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:23,130
female lead being being a shitty like
action movie,

374
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:27,540
but like women can make shitty mindless
shooter movies too.

375
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:28,890
Like what?
Why is it,

376
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,090
why is that a positive thing?
Rather rather than having like a female

377
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:35,160
be president in a movie or you know,
some,

378
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:39,060
some substantial already had that.
Angela Bassett was president in one

379
00:18:39,061 --> 00:18:43,110
movie one time and.
But the big one was of course a Gorney

380
00:18:43,111 --> 00:18:47,190
weaver in fucking alien.
She's the best bad ass chick ever.

381
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,790
Who's more bad ass.
She didn't have any fucking superpowers.

382
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:56,210
Just a woman who survived on a spaceship
with a fucking creature that nobody had

383
00:18:56,281 --> 00:18:59,280
ever seen before.
That movie was the shit.

384
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,460
And nobody,
nobody disliked that movie because a

385
00:19:02,461 --> 00:19:03,960
woman was the lead.
See,

386
00:19:03,961 --> 00:19:06,540
that's where all this ghostbusters shit
falls apart.

387
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,890
You know,
people are crying,

388
00:19:07,891 --> 00:19:10,320
sexism and all the sudden,
no,

389
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:13,320
it wasn't good.
It just wasn't good.

390
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:14,700
You know,
there's a lot of.

391
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:18,090
I haven't seen it.
What was that movie that everyone loves

392
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:19,590
the wedding movie.
The wedding planner.

393
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,600
No bridesmaids,
bridesmaids.

394
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,600
Everybody loves that fucking movie.
Like universally,

395
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,160
I've never heard anybody who saw that
movie.

396
00:19:26,161 --> 00:19:28,500
I didn't think it was funny.
I've only watched like an hour,

397
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:32,100
but I was laughing my ass off.
It's fucking funny and it's just funny.

398
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,770
It's funny with it.
It's like when Sarah Silverman goes up,

399
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:38,310
she's not funny for a chick.
Fucking funny.

400
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,000
Yeah,
yeah,

401
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,890
exactly.
It's like that's when,

402
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:45,950
when it's just that it's undeniable
alien is an undeniable movie and it

403
00:19:46,471 --> 00:19:48,970
doesn't matter if like you would if it
was brewed.

404
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:53,460
It's perfect.
It's perfect as it is.

405
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:58,050
So like the idea that we need a female
leader so badly that we're willing to

406
00:19:58,051 --> 00:20:00,360
take this one that's embroiled in
controversy.

407
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,070
She's in,
she faints,

408
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,690
she's fainting.
If we bring it up,

409
00:20:03,691 --> 00:20:06,360
we're a sexist.
You're not supposed to fall asleep when

410
00:20:06,361 --> 00:20:09,080
you're just walking around.
This is a,

411
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:14,540
I mostly just don't like the idea of
anytime there's like another Clinton or

412
00:20:15,031 --> 00:20:17,940
another Bush just because like someone
else,

413
00:20:17,941 --> 00:20:21,060
their father made it or her husband or
whatever else made it.

414
00:20:21,061 --> 00:20:23,530
So now they also get to,
you know,

415
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:24,480
and people are like,
oh,

416
00:20:24,481 --> 00:20:27,180
I remember that name change.
I mean,

417
00:20:27,181 --> 00:20:28,730
that's why we keep doing spiderman
movies.

418
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,210
There's another spiderman reboot.
We're going to reboot the whole.

419
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,671
I mean,
that's what we do.

420
00:20:32,671 --> 00:20:35,290
We like to reboot things.
How many King Kong?

421
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,530
So they made it's fucking crazy,
you know,

422
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,990
a gang of the hawks.

423
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,720
There's three different guys.
Have been the hook in modern days.

424
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,100
Eric Bana,
right?

425
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,080
Um,
uh,

426
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:45,600
the,
the,

427
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,590
the Ed Norton.
And then the last one was microflow.

428
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,230
Mark Rufallo who was also in this
campaign.

429
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,680
He's very politically active.
That microflow guy.

430
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,750
But yeah,
we're having a Clinton reboot,

431
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:00,600
right?
I mean,

432
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,830
how many,
how many times can they do a Batman

433
00:21:02,831 --> 00:21:03,540
movie?
There are many.

434
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,410
You guys have been Batman.
Christian Bale,

435
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,730
right?
Ben Affleck,

436
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,640
Michael Heaton,
George Clooney.

437
00:21:09,641 --> 00:21:11,140
More Batman's in anyone,
right?

438
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,660
That's the most reboots.
Or has it been superman?

439
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:18,780
Superman had a TV show plus w why?
Why bother after Christopher Nolan?

440
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:21,280
I mean he knocked it out of the park
with A.

441
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,130
Which one was that?
That was the last three with Batman

442
00:21:24,131 --> 00:21:26,860
begins.
And I'm dark night.

443
00:21:26,861 --> 00:21:29,300
And um,
he's,

444
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:32,860
he's the guy he makes.
He made inception and interstellar and

445
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:37,540
Fermento and whatever.
Christian Bale's to just a motherfucker.

446
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:40,060
That guy's great and every time he's
great in everything.

447
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,480
You know,
you watching you,

448
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,910
you've,
I'm sure you've seen.

449
00:21:42,911 --> 00:21:45,220
I'm a serial killer.
What is it?

450
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,610
American psycho.
Psycho.

451
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,190
Yeah.
Oh my God.

452
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,940
And I really,
that's a disturbing book,

453
00:21:51,941 --> 00:21:54,730
man.
It's somehow or another way more fucked

454
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:57,100
up in book form because it's way more
graphic.

455
00:21:57,101 --> 00:21:58,030
Did you read it?
No.

456
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,010
Bret Easton.
Ellis.

457
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,270
I don't read fiction actually.
I've been meaning to.

458
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,141
Oh really?
Yeah.

459
00:22:02,141 --> 00:22:04,030
I don't know why.
It just doesn't attach to me.

460
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,760
That's really common.
There's a lot of people that don't

461
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:07,893
really.
Yes.

462
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,350
Natasha zero and uh,
and Moshe,

463
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,213
Moshe,
Kasher.

464
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:15,450
They call a like game of thrones.
They call it make them ups.

465
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,980
They don't like fiction things because
he could just make up anything.

466
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,880
Oh,
now the dragon comes at Eatsa.

467
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:27,100
I love it on TV and I don't know,
I think that if I read more fiction I

468
00:22:27,101 --> 00:22:28,180
would have a.

469
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:31,420
I think it would help my vocabulary and,
and um,

470
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:35,080
I'd be a better communicator possibly,
but I just don't attach to it.

471
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,393
Yeah,
I like it.

472
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:39,760
I like,
I like a preposterous science fictiony

473
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,710
type stuff.
I think that would be my way in like

474
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:46,000
stuff that dealing with physics and
future and technology stuff.

475
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:49,270
I like horror ones too.
I was always a huge Stephen King fan

476
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,240
just because it's just such a escape,
you know,

477
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:56,080
like to read about something that's just
fun but crazy,

478
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,900
you know,
he just get lost in someone else's

479
00:22:58,901 --> 00:23:01,450
ideas,
someone else's creativity and the only

480
00:23:01,451 --> 00:23:06,070
way they really get to express it fully
is to just make up an entire world,

481
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,780
you know?
Whereas like if someone.

482
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,940
I mean,
you obviously your creative when you

483
00:23:09,941 --> 00:23:12,280
write a book about anything,
you could write a book about nature.

484
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:15,540
He could be a wildlife biologist that
writes an amazing book about nature and

485
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:18,850
you can be creative in your telling of
these stories and make it exciting.

486
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:23,850
But this is kind of a difference to me
when I'm listening to a song or I'm

487
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:29,040
watching a movie or reading a book,
I always try to think this is someone's

488
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:32,050
creativity.
Like this is coming out of a person's

489
00:23:32,051 --> 00:23:35,050
brain.
Invented this whole idea.

490
00:23:35,051 --> 00:23:36,480
That's the premise.
Yeah.

491
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,110
That's fascinating.
To me,

492
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:43,380
you don't have a mind for that for well,
like people who are into like creating

493
00:23:43,931 --> 00:23:48,931
movies especially think that's a very
specific mindset of like looking at all

494
00:23:49,521 --> 00:23:50,960
these different things and go,
oh yeah,

495
00:23:50,961 --> 00:23:54,800
I've got to piece these together and I
have to have an arc and you have to have

496
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:56,750
a hero and I have to have with this and
I have to have a.

497
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:58,070
okay,
how do I,

498
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,900
how do I mix this up?
How do I make it good?

499
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:04,730
I know that's like when I watch,
when I watch like Christopher Nolan or,

500
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:07,370
or Quintin Tarantino or something like
that,

501
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,780
like the story is so good.

502
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:11,270
I'll,
I'll like get teary eyed just at the

503
00:24:11,271 --> 00:24:12,890
story structure,
you know,

504
00:24:12,891 --> 00:24:15,020
and,
and it'll end up being like,

505
00:24:15,021 --> 00:24:18,740
that was perfect.
That's exactly how it needed to end and

506
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:22,820
I'm blown away by that and jealous
because I can't imagine myself ever

507
00:24:22,821 --> 00:24:24,390
thinking of anything like that.
Yeah,

508
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,880
no,
there's some movies that you just walk

509
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,400
out of there you like,
I'm going to do better at whatever I do

510
00:24:28,401 --> 00:24:29,990
today.
I saw that movie.

511
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,910
Yeah.
You only used to tell me all the time

512
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:35,300
that all the time it was Paul Mooney,
Paul Mooney used to always say that when

513
00:24:35,301 --> 00:24:37,340
he wanted to write,
he would go get entertained.

514
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,080
It goes,
go see a show,

515
00:24:39,081 --> 00:24:40,940
go see a live show,
go to the movies,

516
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,170
he goes,
go be entertained,

517
00:24:42,171 --> 00:24:43,820
and then you'll write better.
Yeah,

518
00:24:43,821 --> 00:24:44,461
I mean,
I,

519
00:24:44,461 --> 00:24:46,040
I thought that with,
when I,

520
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:50,420
when I kind of got into doing more
science stuff with my work rather than

521
00:24:50,421 --> 00:24:52,290
just straight stand up,
um,

522
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:54,080
I,
I realized that,

523
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,670
well,
if you want to be interesting,

524
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:59,990
like read interesting things,
be interested in interesting things,

525
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:01,940
you know,
just it just fills that.

526
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,770
Well,
I want to talk to you about that,

527
00:25:03,771 --> 00:25:04,970
but before I talked to him,
the problem,

528
00:25:04,971 --> 00:25:06,520
want to forget about this,
you,

529
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:07,300
you,
um,

530
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:12,300
we were talking about what I think we
say Kratom I think we call Kratom and

531
00:25:12,891 --> 00:25:15,770
um,
this is something that is in the news

532
00:25:15,771 --> 00:25:20,030
right now because it's helped a lot of
people overcome opioid addiction.

533
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:23,300
Yeah.
And they're about to make it schedule

534
00:25:23,301 --> 00:25:28,280
one meaning that it has no medical use
whatsoever.

535
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:28,710
No,
no.

536
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:29,511
Right,
right.

537
00:25:29,511 --> 00:25:30,880
Highly addictive,
you know,

538
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,680
medical use.
We're going to take it right now.

539
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,960
Right now it's legal to do.
Boy,

540
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,700
they're going to get you record
retroactive.

541
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:42,350
No statue of limitations on the illegal
drug.

542
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:45,530
That takes like an hour to kick in.
And so,

543
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:48,130
and this is a very mild dose.
It is 12,

544
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:51,470
23,
1:23 and started asking weird questions.

545
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,430
I'm already on some.
Oh,

546
00:25:53,431 --> 00:25:56,030
you already on some before taking this
shit all day long?

547
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,153
Uh,
no.

548
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,840
I pick it in the bar.
Do podcasts.

549
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,833
Well,
um,

550
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:06,410
I still have some pain management issues
from an injury and the injury because

551
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:07,670
it's crazy.
It's crazy story.

552
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,680
Uh,
so I was,

553
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:12,140
this is a couple of years ago,
I,

554
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:16,520
I was in the best shape of my life and I
was rock climbing like three,

555
00:26:16,521 --> 00:26:19,640
four times a week and doing crossfit and
all this.

556
00:26:19,641 --> 00:26:20,880
And I was like,
I,

557
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,080
I've always been lanky like this my
whole life and I actually had muscles

558
00:26:24,081 --> 00:26:27,320
for the first time in my life and just
like felt like superman and,

559
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:30,890
and I was supposed to be.
Rock climbing is on my birthday.

560
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,310
And um,
and there's some fires in Sedona where

561
00:26:34,311 --> 00:26:36,250
the rock climbing is supposed to be and
so,

562
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:40,580
so we went for a hike instead just to
see a little bit of Sedona as my first

563
00:26:40,581 --> 00:26:44,280
time there.
And I was out with my friend Mikey

564
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,200
and he,
so he,

565
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:50,520
he was like this,
he was like three,

566
00:26:50,521 --> 00:26:53,250
400 pounds,
I think he was like 400 pounds.

567
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,470
I'm like,
his whole life,

568
00:26:55,471 --> 00:27:00,471
he's been a hugely obese.
And then he went on this diet that he

569
00:27:00,961 --> 00:27:05,961
just drank coffee with butter in it for
like 40 days.

570
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,230
That's it.
That's all he ate himself out.

571
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,580
And then he,
uh,

572
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:14,310
how much did you lose in 40 days?
Like a thousand pounds,

573
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,090
200 pounds.
He lost like all of his weight.

574
00:27:18,091 --> 00:27:22,110
And then he was like a normal person.
That sounds crazy.

575
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:25,980
Sign us 200 pounds in 40 days.
I don't know if it was that much.

576
00:27:25,981 --> 00:27:27,770
It was significant.
It was like,

577
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:32,780
well over a hundred pounds
and he and then he.

578
00:27:33,871 --> 00:27:37,890
So then he started doing like Jujitsu,
sort of like becoming active for the

579
00:27:37,891 --> 00:27:41,310
first time in his life and was like all
excited about this.

580
00:27:41,311 --> 00:27:42,720
And so he was like,
oh,

581
00:27:42,721 --> 00:27:45,180
I have this,
there's this one shortcut that I want to

582
00:27:45,181 --> 00:27:47,180
take my,
my wife will never let me,

583
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,040
so let's,
let's go ahead and do that now.

584
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,710
And I liked that.
It let me take a shortcut because it was

585
00:27:52,711 --> 00:27:57,090
too high of a jump and then I,
and we got to this and um,

586
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:59,220
and I looked and I was like,
yeah,

587
00:27:59,221 --> 00:28:01,350
that's too high.
And he was like,

588
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,720
so because he's been so huge his whole
life,

589
00:28:03,721 --> 00:28:07,720
he has no idea of how high you can jump
from like this.

590
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:12,650
He's never been able to show before.
And,

591
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:15,180
and I know because I'm an adrenaline
junkie,

592
00:28:15,181 --> 00:28:18,120
I love heights.
I've been climbing trees and jumping off

593
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:20,970
shit my whole life.
And um,

594
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:23,310
and I was like,
this is too high.

595
00:28:23,311 --> 00:28:23,931
And he's like,
oh,

596
00:28:23,931 --> 00:28:26,260
I think if we like climb down a little
it be okay.

597
00:28:26,261 --> 00:28:27,210
And I'm like,
I don't know.

598
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:31,860
And I was wearing barefoot running shoes
at the time and then he was determined

599
00:28:31,861 --> 00:28:35,670
he was going to do it in high psych,
so it was jumping from a cliff onto

600
00:28:35,671 --> 00:28:36,504
another cliff.

601
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:41,900
And so if you couldn't roll and if you
landed it wrong and you rolled off,

602
00:28:43,231 --> 00:28:46,700
it was like death on hundreds of feet.
And um,

603
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:49,200
and uh,
and so now I'm like,

604
00:28:49,201 --> 00:28:54,201
I'm gonna Watch this guy roll off this
cliff because he's new to like physical

605
00:28:54,481 --> 00:28:56,430
activity.
It doesn't know what the fuck he's

606
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,590
doing.
And he's about to jump off this thing.

607
00:28:58,591 --> 00:29:02,400
That's the lie on the other side.
He's been carrying around an extra 100

608
00:29:02,401 --> 00:29:05,340
plus pounds on his legs his whole life.
His legs are probably strong as hell.

609
00:29:05,341 --> 00:29:05,971
Yeah.
Yeah,

610
00:29:05,971 --> 00:29:07,740
I imagine.
And uh,

611
00:29:07,741 --> 00:29:11,490
it was weird because he had like weird
skin hanging off everywhere.

612
00:29:11,491 --> 00:29:15,030
It's tough from a,
like stretch marks and stuff.

613
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,350
But he,
um,

614
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:19,230
so he was,
he was determined and I was like,

615
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,970
I was looking at it and I was like,
you know what,

616
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,920
I think that I could make it.

617
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,410
Oh.
And then I can,

618
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:28,560
I can like at least be there so he make
sure he doesn't roll off this fucking

619
00:29:28,561 --> 00:29:29,970
cliff up front of me.
God.

620
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,670
And um,
uh,

621
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:32,491
yeah,
I mean,

622
00:29:32,491 --> 00:29:34,020
you know,
some of those things you feel like a

623
00:29:34,021 --> 00:29:36,990
fool in hindsight.
And I was like,

624
00:29:36,991 --> 00:29:37,590
you know,
I've,

625
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:41,010
I've jumped off stuff higher than this.
It's just that I'm wearing bad shoes.

626
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:43,510
I can't roll.
I'm going to have to take with my feet.

627
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,100
And I even told them,
I was like,

628
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:49,750
I'm going to be risking breaking a heel
because I broke a heel once before when

629
00:29:49,751 --> 00:29:51,760
I was a teenager.
I love jumping off shit.

630
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:54,190
Um,
and so,

631
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,950
but it wasn't like the end of the world.
I was like,

632
00:29:56,951 --> 00:29:57,580
you know,
if that,

633
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,980
if I break a hail,
it won't,

634
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:03,820
I'll still be able to get around.
It's just like a couple month thing.

635
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:04,720
And I,
in my mind,

636
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:06,700
this is the worst of what's going to
happen.

637
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,360
And so I went for it and I,
and I jumped and I landed.

638
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,380
And um,
and then,

639
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,420
and I,
as soon as I landed,

640
00:30:16,421 --> 00:30:19,330
I heard both of my heels break.
Um,

641
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:22,810
it just the sound shot through my body
and I heard it,

642
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,770
it sounded like a branch,
like snapping underwater and,

643
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,860
and I,
I was,

644
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:32,990
I think I was in shock or something
because I just kind of turned and looked

645
00:30:32,991 --> 00:30:35,950
down on my side.
I just broke both my heels and I started

646
00:30:35,951 --> 00:30:38,080
just like that.
And so he thought I was like joking.

647
00:30:38,081 --> 00:30:39,430
So he was just about to do.
I'm like,

648
00:30:39,431 --> 00:30:39,701
no,
no,

649
00:30:39,701 --> 00:30:41,590
no,
I really broke both my heels.

650
00:30:41,591 --> 00:30:44,530
You're going to have to go around and
try to help me down.

651
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,650
And I started making my way down.

652
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:49,720
It took them like a half hour,
45 minutes to get to me and I had to

653
00:30:49,721 --> 00:30:52,630
kind of,
do you remember when you were in school

654
00:30:52,631 --> 00:30:56,030
and gym class to be able to do that crab
block thing where like your bellies

655
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,970
facing the air?
Um,

656
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:02,860
so I had my left foot just was,
was already like five times that size

657
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:06,700
within like 30 seconds.
And so I couldn't use that at all.

658
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,350
And then my,
my right foot,

659
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,660
it's just a,
I couldn't even tell if it was totally

660
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:12,940
broken or bruised,
real bad buys,

661
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:17,700
able to use my toes thankfully.
And so I had to Kinda like a w,

662
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:22,890
one foot crab walk down and then he got
around to me and was like a couple of

663
00:31:24,541 --> 00:31:28,180
people were trying to help me for a
little bit too steep for anyone to help

664
00:31:28,181 --> 00:31:30,160
me.
So I just kinda had to make it down on

665
00:31:30,161 --> 00:31:35,161
my own once we at level ground,
which took like three hours of just like

666
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,320
it was,
it was an exceptionally annoying.

667
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:40,070
Uh,
it was,

668
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,260
I mean,
it was painful.

669
00:31:41,261 --> 00:31:44,890
I scoot down for a little bit and then
I'd have to take a break for a few

670
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:48,220
minutes and just like,
and just like roll around in the fetal

671
00:31:48,221 --> 00:31:51,130
position in pain.
And um,

672
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:56,470
and then um,
and he was like,

673
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,770
he was like,
so this was his dumb idea.

674
00:31:59,771 --> 00:32:03,550
And on the way down he's just like
standing there like next to me waiting

675
00:32:03,551 --> 00:32:06,310
for me,
like trying to lighten the mood by

676
00:32:06,311 --> 00:32:08,230
telling me jokes and stuff.
I'm like,

677
00:32:08,231 --> 00:32:11,710
dude,
this is not the time for jokes.

678
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:14,830
I am fucking pissed right now.
And um,

679
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:16,300
as I can,
it's fine,

680
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:19,240
it's going to be fine.
I just fucking need to focus and get

681
00:32:19,241 --> 00:32:22,930
through this and got down,
went to the hospital.

682
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,460
I still,
I mean it hurt real bad and we had to go

683
00:32:27,461 --> 00:32:31,900
to a second hospital because the one was
too full in and then,

684
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,480
I mean,
I thought it was bad,

685
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:39,290
but I thought I was like,
this is more than just a little break.

686
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,360
This is,
this is a pretty big break.

687
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,220
And another doctor came in and he's
like,

688
00:32:43,221 --> 00:32:46,040
this is,
this is really serious and uh,

689
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:48,770
and your,
your heels and like 20 pieces.

690
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:51,980
Oh Jesus,
give extra so I could freak out.

691
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,120
Yeah.
It's um,

692
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:54,840
it's actually the,
the uh,

693
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,940
I,
I made an album about it called my big

694
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:02,960
break and that's Paul.
That's the cover art as the x ray of,

695
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:06,770
of my heel.
So say x Ray postsurgery.

696
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,390
It's got all the screws and plates in
it.

697
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,410
Yeah.
Yeah.

698
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:10,550
Um,
I don't know.

699
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:12,740
I imagine I have the originals around
somewhere.

700
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:17,090
Um,
and I'm maybe somewhere way back in my

701
00:33:17,091 --> 00:33:20,000
facebook,
you could see some of the scars and

702
00:33:20,001 --> 00:33:21,650
stuff like that.
It's real grill,

703
00:33:21,651 --> 00:33:23,450
so I'm not sure if you'd be able to find
it or not.

704
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,400
Um,
but,

705
00:33:25,401 --> 00:33:25,971
uh,
so,

706
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:30,971
so they put these metal plates in and
kind of screwed in the pieces of the

707
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,290
bigger pieces of bone that were still
there,

708
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,530
like where they wanted them to be
eventually because it's,

709
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:38,690
you can't just put the bone,
it's like if you,

710
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,810
if you snap like a candy bar and try to
put it together,

711
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,940
there's all these crumbs and stuff like
that missing.

712
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:47,330
And so they just kind of put it in place
where it was supposed to be.

713
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,530
And,
and,

714
00:33:48,531 --> 00:33:50,150
um,
and they were like,

715
00:33:50,151 --> 00:33:53,060
well,
hopefully it just kinda grows back and

716
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:54,830
comes together.
Right.

717
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:56,870
And um,
and it did,

718
00:33:57,010 --> 00:34:00,860
it really the real issue was.
So they,

719
00:34:00,861 --> 00:34:03,680
um,
the way they did the surgery,

720
00:34:03,681 --> 00:34:05,510
they told me ahead of time,
ladies and gentlemen,

721
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,650
it's a first,
you see that,

722
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,810
what am I looking at right here?
Yeah,

723
00:34:08,811 --> 00:34:11,930
what is it that's the from where they
went in with the surgery.

724
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,790
So,
um,

725
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,030
they,
they,

726
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:17,960
they said they didn't want to do the
surgery at first because they're like,

727
00:34:17,961 --> 00:34:21,050
this is really complicated surgery,
but if we don't do it,

728
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,840
don't think you're ever going to walk
right again.

729
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:26,630
And um,
why did they not want to do they weren't

730
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:27,980
qualified to do it?
Is that the idea?

731
00:34:27,981 --> 00:34:30,680
No,
this guy was like this guy,

732
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,940
I got referrals and this guy was like as
good of theirs.

733
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,310
Theirs go further back than that.
There's some real disgusting stuff.

734
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,770
Um,
so um,

735
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:45,320
they just,
just the area that it's in and so

736
00:34:45,321 --> 00:34:46,700
there's,
this is,

737
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:49,490
it's like a 90 degree angle that they
have to cut in,

738
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,700
in the corner of,
uh,

739
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:51,860
oh,
there we go.

740
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:54,140
That doesn't look good.
That.

741
00:34:54,141 --> 00:34:57,990
And that was like,
that was like months and months later

742
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:00,440
too.
That was post surgery.

743
00:35:00,441 --> 00:35:03,610
This is like four months after the fact
that it looks like what it looked like.

744
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,480
Tissue.
Yeah,

745
00:35:05,481 --> 00:35:08,560
a lot of scar tissue and stuff.
So see where it's open there in that

746
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:09,680
corner.
Ripped open.

747
00:35:09,681 --> 00:35:12,170
They're like,
I hope this corner doesn't rip open

748
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:15,830
because this sometimes happens with this
surgery and if it does,

749
00:35:15,831 --> 00:35:17,870
you're going to be really susceptible to
infection.

750
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:23,030
And so I had,
I couldn't when I was at the time I

751
00:35:23,031 --> 00:35:26,760
lived in Malibu and my place had like 50
steps and there's no way I could like

752
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:29,690
get up with groceries and everything
with two broken feet.

753
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:32,300
I could get around on crutches a little
bit.

754
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:35,240
But uh,
I ended up having to spend like three

755
00:35:35,241 --> 00:35:39,420
months in my parents basement because I
couldn't care for myself or anything.

756
00:35:39,421 --> 00:35:44,421
So like on top of having to cancel three
months of work and not have,

757
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:48,660
you know,
we don't have a safety net and having no

758
00:35:48,661 --> 00:35:51,660
income and you know,
it was,

759
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:54,320
it was actually like,
I'm very grateful for my parents and

760
00:35:54,321 --> 00:35:55,050
everything,
but it's,

761
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:57,150
you know,
it's just embarrassing and you're like,

762
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,130
oh,
I had to move him at my parents

763
00:35:59,131 --> 00:36:01,070
basement.
I'm sure they understand them.

764
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,360
It's not like you just,
you know,

765
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:07,530
we were a loser and wake up on time,
lost your apartment,

766
00:36:07,531 --> 00:36:09,960
you know,
this is just fuck man.

767
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,900
The worst part to come to start walking
again.

768
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:18,230
So after three months I got back on the
road and um,

769
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:23,010
and there was still this,
this little kind of wound that it opened

770
00:36:23,011 --> 00:36:25,740
up,
wasn't healing and then I started,

771
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,610
it was just taking the,
they told me it was going to take like

772
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:34,640
at least six months to like start
walking and it ended up taking much

773
00:36:35,791 --> 00:36:38,790
longer than that because so about four
or five months in,

774
00:36:38,791 --> 00:36:41,130
I got on the road and then,
um,

775
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:45,540
and then a,
a doctor thought that maybe I was

776
00:36:45,541 --> 00:36:48,180
getting a,
like just a topical infection and gave

777
00:36:48,181 --> 00:36:52,500
me some stuff that wasn't good enough
for the infection.

778
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,370
And then,
um,

779
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,060
I started.
So about four or five months later I

780
00:36:57,061 --> 00:37:01,200
started having fevers and then I went
into the hospital and then they're like,

781
00:37:01,201 --> 00:37:03,390
you have a bone infection.
And I was like,

782
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,710
Ugh,
God.

783
00:37:04,711 --> 00:37:07,580
Because they are like,
this is really serious because that's

784
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:10,770
when you can lose your foot and stuff.
If they can't stop the infection,

785
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:14,310
they just have to cut it off.
Jesus came back,

786
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,500
canceled every,
all my work again.

787
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:21,330
Came back to La.
They did a surgery and um,

788
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:26,040
and I was really thankful that I'd
happened to sign up for the health care.

789
00:37:26,041 --> 00:37:28,000
This was right when the universal
healthcare,

790
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:30,300
it just came out.
Otherwise I'd be bankrupt from it,

791
00:37:30,301 --> 00:37:34,110
but it was still certainly it was not
perfect at all.

792
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,700
Uh,
they wouldn't let me do stuff out of

793
00:37:35,701 --> 00:37:38,370
state.
I had to get myself back to California.

794
00:37:38,371 --> 00:37:39,000
And.

795
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,830
And what do you mean by stuff out of
state?

796
00:37:40,831 --> 00:37:44,280
You mean surgical procedure?
Surgery and hospital checkups I had to

797
00:37:44,281 --> 00:37:46,770
pay,
like do them in California because of

798
00:37:46,771 --> 00:37:47,790
your insurance?
Yeah.

799
00:37:47,791 --> 00:37:51,680
And so when I was in Wisconsin I had to
pay out of pocket for that and,

800
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,660
and it's like kind of not supposed to be
that way either,

801
00:37:54,661 --> 00:37:57,210
but there was the,
I mean I would,

802
00:37:57,270 --> 00:38:00,150
I would call and try to in the insurance
company will be like,

803
00:38:00,151 --> 00:38:01,620
you need this one form.
Okay,

804
00:38:01,621 --> 00:38:03,900
I call this company and they'd be like,
yeah,

805
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:07,080
only doctors can get that form.
And so I'd tell my doctor and he'd be

806
00:38:07,081 --> 00:38:07,561
like,
no,

807
00:38:07,561 --> 00:38:09,060
you can get that.
You have to go here.

808
00:38:09,061 --> 00:38:12,570
And then it was like around and around,
sometimes I'd have to like pretend I was

809
00:38:12,571 --> 00:38:15,960
a doctor and then I was on the phone
with people just to get this fucking

810
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:17,040
form that I need.

811
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,560
And so I paid out of pocket.
So I was like,

812
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:22,350
you know,
getting medical bills were piling up.

813
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,430
And so the second surgery,
what they did was they just cut out,

814
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,410
they took out the hardware,
that's what,

815
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:32,760
that's what got infected.
And then they kind of were where the

816
00:38:32,761 --> 00:38:34,800
holes were from the screws.
They,

817
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,700
they kind of drill those out a little
bit and then they just cut off it cut as

818
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:43,990
big of a hole as they possibly could in
my foot to suck out as much of the

819
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:47,680
infection as possible.
And so I thought I was going to be in a

820
00:38:47,681 --> 00:38:50,260
hospital for and I still hadn't walked
at this point.

821
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:51,670
And then I thought I was going to be
there,

822
00:38:51,671 --> 00:38:55,420
like you'll be in a hospital for like a
week and a half or so,

823
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,220
two weeks.
And I was like,

824
00:38:57,221 --> 00:38:58,060
okay,
fine.

825
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:58,950
I like,
I'm in.

826
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,970
I finally,
someone's going to be like,

827
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,100
taking care of me,
we're just going to get this done,

828
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:03,610
right.

829
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:06,280
I have my computer,
I was in good spirits and,

830
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:08,560
and getting a lot of work done and
stuff.

831
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,770
And um,
and then like two days later they were

832
00:39:11,771 --> 00:39:14,350
like,
your insurance is saying that they think

833
00:39:14,351 --> 00:39:18,670
you're better and you need to go home
and now we need to show you how to care

834
00:39:18,671 --> 00:39:22,210
for yourself.
So I had to train me on how to.

835
00:39:22,211 --> 00:39:26,020
I had to give Myself Ivy antibiotics
three times a day.

836
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:27,843
Yeah,
they had,

837
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:29,630
they,
they put ivy,

838
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:34,270
they put lines in my arm and I had to
like make sure that their sanitary all

839
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:36,250
the time.
And I'd have to get a minute.

840
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,520
Hold on a second.
That's a complex medical procedure.

841
00:39:39,521 --> 00:39:41,950
Giving yourself an ivy dude.
I had to google it.

842
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,400
I like fucking Google.
What's the name of your insurance

843
00:39:45,401 --> 00:39:47,020
company?
Um,

844
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,680
I don't know,
do I have the.

845
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:53,020
That's insane.
Um,

846
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,093
the fact I'm trying.

847
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:58,300
So that's the other thing is I have like
two different insurance companies.

848
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:02,010
So this is like health net and then
there's like this lakeside medical,

849
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:06,970
which one will never know which one is
like the I call one and they'd be like,

850
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:07,804
no,
that's your,

851
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:09,430
your other company.
I called the other one.

852
00:40:09,431 --> 00:40:10,264
No,
that's kind of,

853
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:14,890
it was just a year of dealing with this.
So because of the fact that this was so

854
00:40:14,891 --> 00:40:16,450
expensive,
they just decided to say,

855
00:40:16,451 --> 00:40:19,120
fuck this guy,
let's make him do all the medical stuff

856
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,140
himself.
Yeah.

857
00:40:20,141 --> 00:40:21,970
They were like,
have you ever heard of that before?

858
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,770
They were like,
well he's a young guy.

859
00:40:23,771 --> 00:40:26,680
He seems like he's in good spirits and
healthy.

860
00:40:26,681 --> 00:40:29,620
Seems like a bright guy.
Like he could take care of himself.

861
00:40:29,621 --> 00:40:32,700
I think it was the logic behind it.
And so let's,

862
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,900
let's get them out of here because it's
is expensive.

863
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,910
What's that?
Could you fight it?

864
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:38,320
I tried.
I was like,

865
00:40:38,321 --> 00:40:39,154
what?
Your,

866
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:41,950
I can't do this on my own.
Then when they showed me what I had to

867
00:40:41,951 --> 00:40:45,400
do,
it was so once I get the ibs hooked up

868
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:48,520
and I'd have to figure out how to like
get bubbles out of the lines and stuff

869
00:40:48,521 --> 00:40:49,810
like that.
Like I was googling,

870
00:40:49,811 --> 00:40:53,540
how do you get bubbles out of the lines
and that's literally what I say.

871
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:57,280
Then I had to,
the first time they showed me what I had

872
00:40:57,281 --> 00:40:58,280
to do.
I,

873
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:00,010
I couldn't believe it.
They're like,

874
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,510
no,
watch this because you're going to have

875
00:41:01,511 --> 00:41:04,990
to do this yourself.
And then so this huge hole in my foot

876
00:41:04,991 --> 00:41:08,380
was packed full of gauze and they
started pulling out this gauze.

877
00:41:08,381 --> 00:41:10,510
I didn't know how big the hole was at
first,

878
00:41:10,511 --> 00:41:15,130
but then it was like one of those magic
scarves on calming.

879
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:17,380
Yeah.
And then they're like,

880
00:41:17,381 --> 00:41:20,290
so you're gonna need to take this out
and then look in here.

881
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:23,370
Look in your whole.
You're going to need to clean it out and

882
00:41:23,371 --> 00:41:25,700
like clean off your bone and stuff.
Oh,

883
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:28,240
everyday you could see your bone it.
Oh yeah.

884
00:41:28,241 --> 00:41:33,241
I had to like scrub it off and then.
And then I had to pack it full of Shit

885
00:41:34,521 --> 00:41:39,521
again and all of this with like wearing
gloves and a mask and everything like

886
00:41:39,891 --> 00:41:40,724
that.
And,

887
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:44,000
and then I,
and then I'd have to like put a rubber

888
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,340
thing on to,
to take a shower.

889
00:41:46,341 --> 00:41:49,940
I had to do this three times a day and
then I couldn't sleep either because I

890
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:53,900
needed the IB antibiotics had to be
every eight hours and it took two hours

891
00:41:53,901 --> 00:41:57,140
to do them.
And so I could never get like a full

892
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:59,180
eight hour rest.

893
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:02,380
So I was like mad it up.
Uh,

894
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,840
took two hours for the IB fluids to go
in and kick in.

895
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:06,651
Yeah,
yeah,

896
00:42:06,651 --> 00:42:07,540
yeah.
So you have to do.

897
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:10,370
Oh,
so I'd hang up these bags and stuff.

898
00:42:10,371 --> 00:42:14,510
I'd hook up the ivs,
then I'd spend 20 minutes with my foot

899
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:17,990
and then,
and then after,

900
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:20,420
after like a few weeks of that,
see,

901
00:42:20,421 --> 00:42:22,340
they would always be like,
okay,

902
00:42:22,341 --> 00:42:25,820
we can get you another home visit or
something like that.

903
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:30,590
It would be like a week after I actually
needed it because then I got,

904
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:35,240
I got this vacuum Suction Cup thing that
they put on my feet and um,

905
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,520
and they,
uh,

906
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:41,720
and it just kind of sucks all the
infection stuff out and,

907
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:43,330
and uh,
uh,

908
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,730
gets,
gets rid of it,

909
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:48,950
closes up and creates like blood flow
into that area.

910
00:42:48,951 --> 00:42:52,130
So it generates the things that actually
work amazingly well.

911
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,220
But,
but so then I had this device and like a

912
00:42:55,221 --> 00:42:59,720
vacuum and I started performing again.
I'd have to like take this vacuum off

913
00:42:59,721 --> 00:43:04,721
myself and like close up my fucking foot
hole and then go on stage and perform

914
00:43:05,001 --> 00:43:07,970
and then get off and put this back on,
back on.

915
00:43:07,971 --> 00:43:09,050
And,
and,

916
00:43:09,051 --> 00:43:09,940
uh,
uh,

917
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:15,020
I remember it because I had before I,
before I,

918
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:18,530
um,
I went through a big breakup,

919
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:22,190
um,
before I broke my feet and when I,

920
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:24,770
and I had been in like 12 years of
relationships.

921
00:43:24,771 --> 00:43:27,830
And so I was like,
I'm not dating for a year.

922
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:31,280
I'm not going to have sex.
I'm not going to think about women for a

923
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,810
year.
I'm just going to get my head straight

924
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:37,490
and I did that and it was great and got
tons of work done and then then when I

925
00:43:37,491 --> 00:43:39,840
started getting back into things,
broke feet,

926
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:43,580
it was a no,
I had already I broke my feet during

927
00:43:43,581 --> 00:43:44,320
this time,
which,

928
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:47,990
which helped when like can you just
don't have a sex drive with both of your

929
00:43:47,991 --> 00:43:50,930
feet are broken and um,
and then,

930
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,710
but when I started getting back into it
and like I remember I brought a girl

931
00:43:54,711 --> 00:43:58,700
back back to my hotel when I still had
this fucking vacuum,

932
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,060
uh,
on my foot and I was just like,

933
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:06,290
it was fucking awkward and I hadn't had
sex in like a year or two.

934
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:08,450
So I'm like trying to figure out how to
have sex again.

935
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:11,630
I got a fucking vacuum attached to my
foot hole.

936
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,320
Was your health like,
I mean,

937
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,420
what kind of like energy levels did you
have?

938
00:44:15,421 --> 00:44:16,940
It would seem like if you're going
through,

939
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:20,090
your body's trying to repair itself for
such a long period of time it has to

940
00:44:20,091 --> 00:44:20,960
wear on you,
right?

941
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,820
Yeah.
I mean,

942
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:25,970
it was,
it was more just the depression of it

943
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:27,650
all in,
in the stress was,

944
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:30,740
was harder than I was getting plenty of
sleep and stuff,

945
00:44:30,741 --> 00:44:32,550
but was,
it was a depressing time,

946
00:44:32,551 --> 00:44:37,551
but ultimately it was kind of,
it was kind of good in a way in building

947
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:39,870
and some,
a little bit.

948
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:41,150
I mean,
I mean,

949
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,740
I got a good elvanto um,
I,

950
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:47,280
so,
I mean when I started in Boston and I

951
00:44:47,281 --> 00:44:49,620
started doing comedy,
I was fearless.

952
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:53,970
I would do like a ballsiest stuff,
always trying new material and I just

953
00:44:53,971 --> 00:44:58,170
did not give a shit and I got a lot of
attention for it and I caught some

954
00:44:58,171 --> 00:45:02,820
breaks early on and once I started
making money and doing the road it was

955
00:45:02,821 --> 00:45:05,910
like,
then you're worried about like getting

956
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:10,110
negative comment cards and all this shit
and that's like my livelihood.

957
00:45:10,111 --> 00:45:12,660
And it was,
it was just watering down what I was

958
00:45:12,661 --> 00:45:15,480
doing and I wasn't fearless on stage
anymore.

959
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:16,920
Um,
it.

960
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:20,700
And,
and so after breaking my feet and having

961
00:45:20,701 --> 00:45:22,890
three months of my parents' house,
it kind of was just like,

962
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:26,580
I don't give a fuck anymore.
I'm just doing exactly what I want to do

963
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:28,620
and it was,
it was,

964
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,640
uh,
it really created a change in,

965
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:33,240
in my career.
I thought that album and like the new

966
00:45:33,241 --> 00:45:36,120
act that I'm doing now or the best that
I've ever been.

967
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:38,880
How long ago was the incident and the
accident?

968
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:41,520
And how long did it take you to recover?
Um,

969
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:43,620
so it was,
it was two years ago,

970
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:45,420
um,
in May.

971
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:50,690
And then I about one year in I started
using a cane and then that's when I,

972
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,260
that was really hard when I started
using a cane because I was like,

973
00:45:58,261 --> 00:46:00,030
yes,
the light at the end of the tunnel.

974
00:46:00,031 --> 00:46:01,350
And then I realized,
oh,

975
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:06,440
every other step that I take for the
rest of my life I think is going to hurt

976
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:08,820
just every other step.
And so it's like always.

977
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:11,830
That's why,
that's why I take kratom before podcasts

978
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:15,090
because there's always a part of my
brain that can't stop talk.

979
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:18,300
I can't stop thinking about my stupid
fucking foot.

980
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,000
Is it hurting you right now?
Um,

981
00:46:21,001 --> 00:46:22,290
no.
Right now it feels fine,

982
00:46:22,291 --> 00:46:24,280
but when you would walk here,
um,

983
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,640
well the Kratom helps,
but if I,

984
00:46:26,641 --> 00:46:31,641
if I'm not on that most days it's just
like having a pretty sore foot and then

985
00:46:32,281 --> 00:46:36,240
some days,
like probably now it's coming along

986
00:46:36,241 --> 00:46:39,150
better than I thought it would actually
about three days out of a month.

987
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:41,760
I have like this streak and I don't know
what causes it.

988
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:43,500
I don't know if it's inactivity,
the weather,

989
00:46:43,501 --> 00:46:46,110
whatever.
I have a streak of like three days where

990
00:46:46,111 --> 00:46:48,930
I can just be where I should be using a
cane again,

991
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,780
where if you saw me it'd be like,
what's wrong with that guy?

992
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,310
Years later?
Yeah,

993
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,920
yeah,
yeah.

994
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:57,300
Oh,
about a year and a half after I started

995
00:46:57,301 --> 00:47:00,900
using a cane.
So I was on a cane for about six months

996
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,500
and then I started going without the
cane and just using it sometimes.

997
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:06,330
And uh,
yeah.

998
00:47:06,331 --> 00:47:10,910
So it's been quite an ordeal.
Are you doing any exercising?

999
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:13,560
Actually,
I'm as crazy as this might sound.

1000
00:47:13,850 --> 00:47:16,700
I got back into rock climbing.
Um,

1001
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:19,230
I know,
I know how that sounds.

1002
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:23,130
Hear me out.
I only do indoor stuff.

1003
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:26,430
So here's what I can't do,
I can't run or jump,

1004
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:28,710
I can't do any quick activities and I
couldn't,

1005
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,570
I couldn't do like squats or anything
like that on it.

1006
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:35,350
Um,
but what I can do is slow,

1007
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:39,100
deliberate movement that will help with
flexibility.

1008
00:47:39,101 --> 00:47:44,101
Right now it's mostly flexibility and
mobility issues and nerve damage issues

1009
00:47:44,741 --> 00:47:46,270
like the bones.
Totally fine.

1010
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:47,470
Can you,
um,

1011
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:51,010
stand on your tippy toes?
Can you stand on the balls of your feet?

1012
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:55,870
I can a little bit on my bad foot.
I can't do like a,

1013
00:47:55,930 --> 00:47:59,520
I can't do a calf raise like a one
legged calf raise on you.

1014
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:05,220
Could you bend down with your heels up?
Could you go all the way down?

1015
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:08,570
Like could you stay on the balls of your
feet and then

1016
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,690
Oh,
down in the squat position with your

1017
00:48:10,691 --> 00:48:13,990
heels off the ground.
I'm a little bit

1018
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:16,510
what I was thinking of.
There's a thing called the Hindu squat

1019
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:20,140
and what a Hindu squad is.
It's a bodyweight squat and I'm a big

1020
00:48:20,141 --> 00:48:21,400
proponent of it.
I love them.

1021
00:48:21,401 --> 00:48:26,050
I do them all the time and I do them in
sets of like 150,

1022
00:48:26,051 --> 00:48:28,510
160.
Sometimes when I'm in really good shape,

1023
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:33,520
I do 200 at a time and then I do.
This is my main leg workouts.

1024
00:48:33,521 --> 00:48:36,460
I do those and then I do kettle bell
squats afterwards,

1025
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:39,640
but the thing about the Hindu squats is
it's all body weight.

1026
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:42,010
You don't use any weight.
Sometimes I put a weight vest on,

1027
00:48:42,011 --> 00:48:43,810
but most of the time I don't do any
weight,

1028
00:48:43,811 --> 00:48:45,400
but if you look at that diagram up
there,

1029
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:50,350
you see when you go down your heels come
off the ground,

1030
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:55,560
your hands go behind your heels and then
as you go up your hands stay parallel to

1031
00:48:55,931 --> 00:48:58,120
the floor in front of you.
So you go.

1032
00:48:58,121 --> 00:49:00,470
As you go up,
you push off with the balls of your feet

1033
00:49:00,471 --> 00:49:02,690
and not with your heel.
So as opposed to a regular,

1034
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:05,140
a regular squat.
Rather if you had weight behind your

1035
00:49:05,141 --> 00:49:08,560
back with a bar,
that weight would be on your heel.

1036
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:11,320
You would actually concentrate on
keeping it on your heel,

1037
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,410
concentrated on keeping your.
You know,

1038
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:16,210
when I do squats with weight,
I look up,

1039
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,980
look straight up,
so I make sure that my spines and

1040
00:49:18,981 --> 00:49:20,680
alignment,
but there's a lot of weight on your heel

1041
00:49:20,681 --> 00:49:21,130
there.

1042
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:21,760
Yeah.
Yeah.

1043
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,260
With the squats.
No,

1044
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:27,460
actually that doesn't the weight on the
heel that like the heels totally fine.

1045
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:28,690
Um,
it's,

1046
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:33,610
it's more of a mobility issue and,
and like all the tendons and stuff like

1047
00:49:33,611 --> 00:49:36,700
that that they went through during the
surgery and all the nerve damage from

1048
00:49:36,701 --> 00:49:39,490
it.
So like actually going up on my toes is,

1049
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:43,720
is one of the harder parts maybe be a
good thing to break everything up in

1050
00:49:43,721 --> 00:49:44,950
there?
Yeah,

1051
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:47,710
it does.
When I do like a really intense hike,

1052
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:50,110
um,
my foot feels better.

1053
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:51,340
Oh Man.
Yeah.

1054
00:49:51,341 --> 00:49:53,230
Yeah.
Well you should definitely do these then

1055
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:57,580
I guarantee you they would help.
I want to get on the fucking Joe Rogan

1056
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,200
program it.
Tell it,

1057
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:00,250
tell me,
uh,

1058
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:02,380
give me a rundown.
Everything I needed to do.

1059
00:50:02,381 --> 00:50:05,740
I want to start a.
I was in the best shape of my life and

1060
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:08,500
in this whole thing it made me fall out
of all of it.

1061
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,390
And I would love to get back there again

1062
00:50:10,490 --> 00:50:13,770
to you if it's just a mobility issue,
if you don't have actual pain,

1063
00:50:13,771 --> 00:50:15,600
your heel,
I bet you can get back to it because I

1064
00:50:15,601 --> 00:50:17,760
know a lot of guys have plates all over
their body.

1065
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:21,870
They have all sorts of different things
holding their bones together and they

1066
00:50:21,871 --> 00:50:22,440
get back.

1067
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,490
Yeah.
And I do.

1068
00:50:23,491 --> 00:50:27,380
I need to like break up the scar tissue
and all that kind of stuff to see woman

1069
00:50:27,381 --> 00:50:28,160
here.
Okay.

1070
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:31,340
She's doing it wrong because you're
actually supposed to go on the balls of

1071
00:50:31,341 --> 00:50:36,341
your feet and you're supposed to drop
your ass all the way down to the back of

1072
00:50:36,651 --> 00:50:40,940
your calves.
People doing youtube things that to do

1073
00:50:40,941 --> 00:50:43,370
it right.
It was a guy named Matt fury is kind of

1074
00:50:43,371 --> 00:50:44,990
an odd duck.
But uh,

1075
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:47,870
he's a big proponent of them.
He's got a bunch of videos of him doing

1076
00:50:47,871 --> 00:50:49,820
it online.
Here you go.

1077
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,320
That's how you do it.
See how this guy,

1078
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:55,860
as he goes down his heels come off the
ground and they touches the ground in a

1079
00:50:55,861 --> 00:50:58,160
circular motion.
And then he brings his arms parallel in

1080
00:50:58,161 --> 00:50:59,750
front of him.
These are great.

1081
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:02,150
I think I could do that there.
Super easy.

1082
00:51:02,210 --> 00:51:06,330
For the first 10,
20 gets a little harder than than 30.

1083
00:51:06,331 --> 00:51:07,910
He gets a little harder than 40.
It's a little harder.

1084
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:10,340
And then he started hitting like 90 and
you go,

1085
00:51:10,341 --> 00:51:12,740
okay,
I got 60 more of these motherfuckers to

1086
00:51:12,741 --> 00:51:13,790
go.
And then you know,

1087
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:16,340
your,
your legs get super fatigued.

1088
00:51:16,341 --> 00:51:19,070
But that's like what I like to do for
legs.

1089
00:51:19,071 --> 00:51:22,940
I start off with Kettlebell swings just
to sort of get everything loosened up.

1090
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:26,270
I do it light for a couple sets than I
do heavy ones.

1091
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:30,440
And then from there everything's all
warmed up and loosened up.

1092
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:33,740
Then I get into those Hindu squats and I
just do because I feel like that's

1093
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:39,040
something that's always hard to do.
Like I went hiking in Nevada with a

1094
00:51:40,191 --> 00:51:42,350
couple friends of mine that were very
fit.

1095
00:51:42,351 --> 00:51:45,710
My friend Dan Dodi who was.
We were doing a TV show up there and

1096
00:51:45,711 --> 00:51:48,680
he's the.
He was the camera man and he was much

1097
00:51:48,681 --> 00:51:52,610
better than me at doing these things.
And it was realizing when I was doing

1098
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:53,570
like,
God damn it,

1099
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,510
this is a very specific thing,
like if you do it all the time,

1100
00:51:56,810 --> 00:52:00,620
if you like a camera cameraman,
especially have the get in some really

1101
00:52:00,621 --> 00:52:03,890
incredible shape and they do these
outdoor shows because they're constantly

1102
00:52:03,891 --> 00:52:06,350
carrying this camera and walking around.

1103
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:09,680
So like if you were doing a show on
hiking and you had a guy following you,

1104
00:52:09,681 --> 00:52:13,790
this guy has to follow you.
All of a sudden he's carrying a big ass

1105
00:52:13,791 --> 00:52:14,624
fucking camera

1106
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:19,470
as he's sitting there shooting what's
supposed to be you doing some impressive

1107
00:52:19,471 --> 00:52:21,360
thing.
Exactly.

1108
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:25,090
He's the real athlete.
But uh,

1109
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:26,070
just the ability to

1110
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:29,280
pick your body up and down for long
periods of time.

1111
00:52:29,281 --> 00:52:30,210
Just hiking.
You know,

1112
00:52:30,211 --> 00:52:34,290
like you could lift weights and you can
do a lot of stuff that you feel like,

1113
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:35,280
oh,
I'm in pretty good shape,

1114
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:39,750
but it's the monotonous grind.
Have hours and hours of going up hills.

1115
00:52:39,751 --> 00:52:40,501
You Go,
Whoa,

1116
00:52:40,501 --> 00:52:41,490
this is something different.

1117
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:43,920
Well,
it also with hiking it,

1118
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:45,600
your,
your foot goes in all these

1119
00:52:45,601 --> 00:52:49,520
unpredictable angles and that that is
what's helping the most.

1120
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:52,170
Like I,
I do stretches and stuff like that,

1121
00:52:52,171 --> 00:52:55,830
but I feel like the stretches,
I'm not mixing it up and was like,

1122
00:52:55,831 --> 00:52:59,100
I do a yoga has been helping when I got
back into rock climbing,

1123
00:52:59,101 --> 00:53:01,380
my gym had a yoga class so I was able to
do that.

1124
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:04,470
I can't balance on one foot a little
bit.

1125
00:53:04,471 --> 00:53:07,730
Not very well.
Does it get shaky or like my,

1126
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:11,160
my also,
I mean fortunately it was my dominant

1127
00:53:11,161 --> 00:53:14,370
leg that got hurt.
So I think it will keep on recovering

1128
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,100
well because there was a little more
strength to start with,

1129
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:20,010
but my calf is pretty atrophied and
everything,

1130
00:53:20,011 --> 00:53:22,830
so it's just also have to get a lot of
strength back.

1131
00:53:22,831 --> 00:53:25,650
Which was um,
I've also of been,

1132
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:29,580
when I fill out a exercising,
I've been a little lazy about it too.

1133
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:31,860
Isn't that interesting how easy that is
to do,

1134
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,470
like even for me,
like I've been exercising my whole life,

1135
00:53:34,471 --> 00:53:38,130
but if I take a few days off,
I know I have to get back to it.

1136
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:40,980
But part of me is like,
come on man,

1137
00:53:40,981 --> 00:53:44,610
fuck this.
I've never been an exercise guy,

1138
00:53:44,611 --> 00:53:49,050
but I was probably working out like
doing something about three hours a day,

1139
00:53:49,051 --> 00:53:54,051
like rock climbing or swimming,
jogging or crossfit or doing some boxing

1140
00:53:55,141 --> 00:53:56,100
stuff.
Yeah,

1141
00:53:56,101 --> 00:53:59,190
it was like,
I was just like on a kick because I also

1142
00:53:59,191 --> 00:54:00,720
had,
I had quit drinking,

1143
00:54:00,721 --> 00:54:02,910
which I drank again now.
But uh,

1144
00:54:02,911 --> 00:54:05,760
I quit drinking and smoking cigarettes
and so I was,

1145
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,560
he smoke cigarettes now.
Um,

1146
00:54:07,561 --> 00:54:11,280
I'm vaping now.
I started after I started drinking

1147
00:54:11,281 --> 00:54:14,880
again,
cigarettes followed shortly after and

1148
00:54:14,881 --> 00:54:17,310
then I saw I've been smoking cigarettes
for about a year,

1149
00:54:17,311 --> 00:54:19,440
which I fucking can't stand cigarettes.

1150
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:23,550
And so I've been vaping and I'm hoping
in like three months I'll be able to go

1151
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:28,551
from vaping to chew.
I don't think I want to do the dip.

1152
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:31,380
I tried dip recently.
It gives you a quite a buzz.

1153
00:54:31,381 --> 00:54:33,240
Yeah,
it's interesting stuff actually

1154
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,340
accidentally swallowed it.
Um,

1155
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:38,310
but here's a,
one of the most interesting things that

1156
00:54:38,311 --> 00:54:41,970
I learned from the injury was,
was how,

1157
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:47,330
how your physical health or wellbeing
alters your perception of the world.

1158
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,330
Like I,
um,

1159
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:52,820
have you ever heard of the study?
They,

1160
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:55,230
they,
they do like the hot and Cold Cup study

1161
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:57,990
where they have someone come in to fill
out a survey,

1162
00:54:58,010 --> 00:54:59,910
you know,
that's what they tell them and then a

1163
00:54:59,911 --> 00:55:03,560
person gets in an elevator and they,
uh,

1164
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:04,403
and there's,
uh,

1165
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:06,720
there's someone in there like
confederate,

1166
00:55:06,721 --> 00:55:09,390
an actor is in there that's like,
here I,

1167
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:11,550
my hands are full,
could you hold this cup for me?

1168
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:14,010
And it's either like a hot cup of coffee
or whatever,

1169
00:55:14,011 --> 00:55:17,190
or cold drink and the person says,
sure takes the drink,

1170
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:19,500
goes up the elevator,
gets off,

1171
00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:21,750
gives it back to them,
you know,

1172
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:25,020
says Bob goes in and takes the survey
and then afterwards,

1173
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:27,930
and this is what it's actually about.
Afterwards they go,

1174
00:55:27,931 --> 00:55:32,220
did you meet anyone in the way in?
And I actually,

1175
00:55:32,221 --> 00:55:34,620
someone I met someone in the elevator
and then they'll,

1176
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:35,640
they'll be like,
so,

1177
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,350
uh,
can you,

1178
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:39,660
can you describe that person?
And if they had,

1179
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:41,730
if they had the hot drink,
they'll,

1180
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:44,040
uh,
they were more,

1181
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:46,620
um,
they would more often describe them as

1182
00:55:46,621 --> 00:55:49,710
being like warm or friendly.
And if they had the cold drink,

1183
00:55:49,711 --> 00:55:52,530
they would,
they would describe them as like cold or

1184
00:55:52,531 --> 00:55:54,300
distant.
And,

1185
00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:55,950
and the idea is,
is that,

1186
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:57,180
that,
um,

1187
00:55:57,510 --> 00:56:02,100
that the way our,
our brains evolved kind of these,

1188
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:05,910
these higher ideas of,
of what like being distant as a

1189
00:56:05,911 --> 00:56:10,710
personality trait or whatever means he
has to be built over this preexisting

1190
00:56:10,711 --> 00:56:14,640
kind of a five senses kind of software.

1191
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:17,040
And um,
and so,

1192
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:21,030
so there's all these metaphors for,
so you call someone like bright or you

1193
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,980
say we're having a deep conversation or
shallow.

1194
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,910
So a lot of these ways in which we
describe life is,

1195
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:32,290
is kind of used through these physical
metaphors.

1196
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:35,080
And I remember when I,
when I broke my feet,

1197
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:40,300
I remember thinking the whole fucking
world is broken.

1198
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:44,710
Like I remember thinking like eyes on
eyes going down this mountain for like

1199
00:56:44,711 --> 00:56:46,360
three,
three hours.

1200
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:50,680
And I wasn't just worried about my feet.
I also like in the fucking political

1201
00:56:50,681 --> 00:56:54,820
system is like everything just seemed
broken like the whole world.

1202
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:59,320
And then I also remember after I got the
second surgery,

1203
00:56:59,321 --> 00:57:01,900
after the bone infection and stuff and
having to change all this,

1204
00:57:01,901 --> 00:57:06,901
I remember feeling like,
like something like this nagging feeling

1205
00:57:08,711 --> 00:57:12,730
that I couldn't get over as like some
things like missing from my life.

1206
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:17,710
There's just this deep like hole
somewhere in my soul in my feet.

1207
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,480
And then one day I realized I'm like,
oh,

1208
00:57:19,481 --> 00:57:23,680
there's a fucking hole in my foot.
There's an actual hole in my foot.

1209
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:25,620
That's what's missing.
And,

1210
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:28,360
and just how much that,
that your,

1211
00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:33,430
your physical senses can alter what your
perception of the world is for sure.

1212
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:36,100
How you feel physically.
Yeah.

1213
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:38,930
Changes how you interact with other
people.

1214
00:57:38,931 --> 00:57:41,440
It changes how people perceive you.
Attend changes,

1215
00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:44,960
the kind of conversations you have
because maybe you'll have more

1216
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:49,940
enthusiasm or energy or friendliness or
whatever it is that when you engage

1217
00:57:49,941 --> 00:57:50,360
with.

1218
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:52,120
Yeah.
Then you can have two broken feet and

1219
00:57:52,121 --> 00:57:53,530
they can give you morphine.
You going to be like,

1220
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:55,180
oh,
life's fine.

1221
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:59,110
That it's going to be great.
How do you go from morphine to this

1222
00:57:59,111 --> 00:58:00,400
Kratom stuff?
Oh,

1223
00:58:00,401 --> 00:58:02,830
this kratom stuff.
I just discovered like three weeks ago,

1224
00:58:02,831 --> 00:58:05,560
I haven't,
I haven't taken painkillers in like a,

1225
00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:08,290
and this isn't a,
I don't know,

1226
00:58:08,291 --> 00:58:11,320
I think the research is out on it.
I'm not saying people should do Kratom.

1227
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:13,140
It's working for me.
Um,

1228
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:16,090
do you ever try a cannabis edible?
Cannabis?

1229
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,530
Yeah,
I like edibles.

1230
00:58:17,531 --> 00:58:20,350
I don't,
I'm not a big weed smoker.

1231
00:58:20,351 --> 00:58:23,350
I probably smoke like twice a week maybe
at the most.

1232
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:25,060
That's hilarious.
Only in California.

1233
00:58:25,061 --> 00:58:27,280
Can you say that?
A big weed smoker.

1234
00:58:27,281 --> 00:58:29,680
I take days off.
I have like,

1235
00:58:29,681 --> 00:58:30,520
I've probably,
yeah,

1236
00:58:30,521 --> 00:58:33,700
probably once or twice a week.
I have like a hit of weed,

1237
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:38,470
but I'm out of bolts help a bit and uh,
the CBDS,

1238
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:41,830
I don't know if I can't tell if the CBDS
are helping or not.

1239
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:44,170
Um,
it seems like they do a little bit,

1240
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:46,570
but I'm still experimenting with some of
that stuff.

1241
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,370
The kratom I just,
I was just in,

1242
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,980
um,
I was in Wilmington,

1243
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,720
North Carolina,
uh,

1244
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:55,930
doing this dead crow club and I had,
I was,

1245
00:58:56,200 --> 00:59:01,180
when I'm doing lots of standup and on my
feet in one place is when it seems to

1246
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:06,130
have a lot of trouble and um,
and I was just like bitching about it

1247
00:59:06,131 --> 00:59:08,410
because I was just having,
it was one of those three days where I

1248
00:59:08,411 --> 00:59:11,080
was just having a rough few days with it
and they're like,

1249
00:59:11,081 --> 00:59:12,730
you should go to the Kratom bar.
I was like,

1250
00:59:12,731 --> 00:59:16,390
what's that freedom bar?
These bars that they have,

1251
00:59:16,391 --> 00:59:20,500
like Kava and Kratom and stuff.
And so I went pretty skeptical,

1252
00:59:20,501 --> 00:59:22,370
especially when something's legal.
I'm like,

1253
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:24,200
okay,
that's not going to do anything.

1254
00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:27,030
Um,
and I,

1255
00:59:27,031 --> 00:59:29,930
I had some.
And right away it was a,

1256
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:32,050
uh,
it,

1257
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:34,370
like within an hour I was like,
oh,

1258
00:59:34,371 --> 00:59:37,940
my foot feels perfect right now.
And I walked just like a normal person

1259
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,730
when I'm on the stuff,
I'm a little skeptical,

1260
00:59:40,731 --> 00:59:42,910
I imagine.
I imagine there's some addictive.

1261
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:43,710
Uh,
I,

1262
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:47,060
I had a scientist sent me a paper about
it and I guess there are some side

1263
00:59:47,061 --> 00:59:48,380
effects.
I haven't read them all yet,

1264
00:59:48,381 --> 00:59:51,500
but it's just not near what,
like any other pain killer,

1265
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:54,680
why are they making it a schedule one?
Is there a real issue that people could

1266
00:59:54,681 --> 00:59:57,620
die from it or what's the ld 50 with
his,

1267
00:59:57,621 --> 01:00:01,130
which is if people don't know lethal
dose at 50 percent,

1268
01:00:01,131 --> 01:00:04,610
meaning that if you give 100 rats a
certain amount,

1269
01:00:04,611 --> 01:00:07,460
50 percent of them are going to die at a
certain.

1270
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:09,410
Yeah,
I have no idea.

1271
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,330
Um,
I,

1272
01:00:10,470 --> 01:00:12,880
I haven't done enough research into it.
Um,

1273
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:15,230
and,
and I imagine it's not that well

1274
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:17,450
studied,
which I understand why,

1275
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:20,120
you know,
the FDA or whatever,

1276
01:00:20,121 --> 01:00:22,730
can't just have companies making,
you know,

1277
01:00:22,731 --> 01:00:24,500
who knows what they're putting in a
bottle.

1278
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:25,610
Right.
I get that.

1279
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,080
Um,
but,

1280
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:31,580
but I mean if you look at what people
are saying about Kratom people that

1281
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:36,830
people that are trying to manage their
pain and nothing else works or

1282
01:00:36,831 --> 01:00:39,710
everything else is really addictive or
makes the movie or whatever.

1283
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:43,130
This stuff is like,
I feel like very energetic,

1284
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:48,220
energetic and enthusiastic and just
sharper than normal when I do it helped

1285
01:00:48,681 --> 01:00:50,910
people get off of opiates.
Um,

1286
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,630
because it's,
it's a partial opiate.

1287
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:55,710
Um,
yeah.

1288
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:59,210
Yeah.
I don't know exactly what that means.

1289
01:00:59,211 --> 01:01:01,250
Stuff all the time.
How come you not like reading things on

1290
01:01:01,251 --> 01:01:02,280
it?
I'm

1291
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,270
a smart guy.
Yeah,

1292
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:08,240
probably taken it like 15 times now.
That's it.

1293
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:09,380
Yeah.
Something like that.

1294
01:01:09,381 --> 01:01:10,214
Okay.
Um,

1295
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:12,760
and twice in front of me.
Yeah.

1296
01:01:13,290 --> 01:01:18,290
Well I call that once.
That will count that as one eye.

1297
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:22,160
It's going to be illegal next month.
So I'm like,

1298
01:01:22,190 --> 01:01:24,530
I'm going to try this stuff and see how
it feels.

1299
01:01:24,970 --> 01:01:27,670
What's the justification?
Is there any justification for the,

1300
01:01:27,671 --> 01:01:30,610
a scheduled one classification.
Is it something that people need to

1301
01:01:30,611 --> 01:01:31,440
worry about?

1302
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,660
I mean if you look at how,
how the uh,

1303
01:01:33,661 --> 01:01:37,520
the Da just just didn't reschedule
marrow,

1304
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:39,420
which has.
Think about it.

1305
01:01:39,421 --> 01:01:42,030
If you're them,
if you reschedule marijuana,

1306
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:44,430
it's basically like you're saying,
hey,

1307
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:47,610
hey,
should we just get rid of our own jobs?

1308
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:48,653
You know,
should,

1309
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:52,830
should we just,
should we just make a law that gets rid

1310
01:01:52,831 --> 01:01:55,170
of our jobs and that's a way of looking
at it.

1311
01:01:55,190 --> 01:01:58,430
That's a cynical way of looking at it.
The people who aren't aware of the

1312
01:01:58,550 --> 01:02:02,000
reality of all the facts and statistics,
they will look at you and go,

1313
01:02:02,001 --> 01:02:03,500
well,
that's ridiculous hippie bullshit.

1314
01:02:03,501 --> 01:02:04,220
But no,
nope.

1315
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:05,340
It's not know that that

1316
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:07,700
is going on.
And the was no way out.

1317
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,710
There's no other way around it.
Yeah.

1318
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,150
I mean the,
the,

1319
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:12,690
the maps,
um,

1320
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:16,100
organization which is actually
sponsoring my tour that I'm doing,

1321
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:19,320
they have,
when I've had them on maps,

1322
01:02:19,321 --> 01:02:22,230
the Multidisciplinary Association of
Psychedelic Studies.

1323
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:23,890
Um,
and they're,

1324
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:28,200
they're the ones doing the MTMA trials
and stuff for ptsd and whatnot.

1325
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:32,010
And they say they actually like working
with the FDA.

1326
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:36,840
The FDA is not the problem at all.
It's the diy.

1327
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:38,640
A bunch of cops.
Yeah.

1328
01:02:38,641 --> 01:02:39,110
Yeah.

1329
01:02:39,110 --> 01:02:40,070
Bunch of.
Listen,

1330
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:43,520
one of the big issues with medical
marijuana or legalizing marijuana is

1331
01:02:43,521 --> 01:02:45,710
prison guard unions,
which is kind of hilarious.

1332
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:48,200
Yeah.
It's like they are literally trying to

1333
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:51,110
keep things illegal so they keep their
jobs.

1334
01:02:51,111 --> 01:02:52,510
So they have more hours.
Exactly.

1335
01:02:52,610 --> 01:02:53,870
It's crazy.
It's again,

1336
01:02:53,871 --> 01:02:55,310
one of those things.
It shouldn't be legal,

1337
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:57,050
just like advertising drugs.
It's one of those.

1338
01:02:57,130 --> 01:02:59,770
Well one was when Nixon scheduled it in
the first place,

1339
01:02:59,771 --> 01:03:04,771
he hired a team of scientists and all of
these different different politicians

1340
01:03:05,021 --> 01:03:08,680
and different,
different experts in different fields to

1341
01:03:09,430 --> 01:03:14,110
advise him and then they advised him to
not schedule it,

1342
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:17,230
to have it be legal and focus on
treatment for things.

1343
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:18,670
And he was like,
nope,

1344
01:03:18,671 --> 01:03:20,860
we're doing.
We've got to get rid of these hippies.

1345
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:22,800
Well that's what it did.
It really.

1346
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:24,930
And this was something that came out
over the last year,

1347
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,940
I don't know,
it was a freedom of information act or

1348
01:03:26,941 --> 01:03:28,800
whatever it was,
but they released some papers that

1349
01:03:28,801 --> 01:03:33,420
showed that what the drug war was truly
all about was the civil rights movement

1350
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:35,520
in the hippies,
the antiwar movement and the civil

1351
01:03:35,521 --> 01:03:39,780
rights movement and that they were
trying to attack the leaders of the

1352
01:03:39,781 --> 01:03:42,600
civil rights movement and the leaders of
the antiwar movement.

1353
01:03:42,601 --> 01:03:46,530
And one thing they all had in common was
marijuana and LSD.

1354
01:03:47,610 --> 01:03:48,690
Mushrooms.
I'm sure too because.

1355
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:52,710
So that's when the sweeping psychedelics
act of 1970 was passed.

1356
01:03:52,711 --> 01:03:56,910
It was all passed under the guise of
attacking the political forces that were

1357
01:03:56,911 --> 01:04:00,570
trying to take Nixon out of office.
Nixon was such a piece of shit.

1358
01:04:00,990 --> 01:04:02,340
No,
such a horrible,

1359
01:04:02,341 --> 01:04:04,590
horrible piece of shit when you're
really.

1360
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:09,090
When you go back and see what that guy
did and who he was and what he stood

1361
01:04:09,091 --> 01:04:09,790
for.
It's

1362
01:04:09,790 --> 01:04:12,020
wow.
When you're like getting impeached,

1363
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:14,530
I have to resign.
Wouldn't you like go back and look at

1364
01:04:14,531 --> 01:04:16,780
the things that he did and be like,
you know what?

1365
01:04:16,810 --> 01:04:21,040
Maybe we do a Redo on that whole
presidency and whatever he did,

1366
01:04:21,041 --> 01:04:21,900
just that.
We,

1367
01:04:21,970 --> 01:04:24,310
we reexamined that.
Yeah.

1368
01:04:24,311 --> 01:04:25,240
All the different things

1369
01:04:25,330 --> 01:04:26,270
was involved in.
Yeah.

1370
01:04:26,271 --> 01:04:27,920
They should have gone over every one of
his.

1371
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:29,990
Everything that he passed with a fine
tooth comb,

1372
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:32,510
but you got a crooked office.
I'm not a crook.

1373
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:35,330
He was a real cook.
Will scary guy.

1374
01:04:36,070 --> 01:04:36,903
I have,
um,

1375
01:04:36,910 --> 01:04:41,570
I might take on,
on why all of that happened was because

1376
01:04:41,571 --> 01:04:44,360
of psychedelics.
Psychedelics have this testable effect

1377
01:04:44,361 --> 01:04:45,190
on,
on,

1378
01:04:45,190 --> 01:04:46,023
um,
uh,

1379
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:49,880
a person's openness.
So if I'm like,

1380
01:04:49,881 --> 01:04:54,020
there's big five personality indicator
that's not perfect by any means,

1381
01:04:54,410 --> 01:04:55,750
but uh,
it's,

1382
01:04:55,790 --> 01:04:59,720
it's used quite a bit in psychology.
So you have conscientiousness,

1383
01:04:59,721 --> 01:05:04,450
like I'm low in conscientiousness,
I'm a very disorganized person and I'm a

1384
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:07,490
kind of messy.
I'm a agreeableness,

1385
01:05:07,491 --> 01:05:09,950
I'm a little low in agreeableness,
like I liked to argue with people and

1386
01:05:09,951 --> 01:05:12,050
stuff.
And then there is stability or sometimes

1387
01:05:12,051 --> 01:05:14,900
called neuroticism.
I'm in the middle there and then there's

1388
01:05:14,901 --> 01:05:16,850
extroversion also in the middle.
And then there's.

1389
01:05:17,710 --> 01:05:22,150
So if you're very high in openness,
that means like you not only are you not

1390
01:05:22,151 --> 01:05:25,060
averse to novelty or you can't get
enough of it,

1391
01:05:25,061 --> 01:05:27,520
you love new restaurants,
traveling,

1392
01:05:27,521 --> 01:05:29,230
meeting New People,
having,

1393
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:30,540
having,
uh,

1394
01:05:30,541 --> 01:05:32,590
you know,
going on adventures and,

1395
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:37,920
and if your in the side effect is you're
the kind of person that maybe ends up

1396
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:41,170
not having respect for authority and
ends up like getting in trouble with the

1397
01:05:41,171 --> 01:05:45,250
law or you're a little overly
spontaneous or a little too adventurous

1398
01:05:45,251 --> 01:05:46,810
and you break your feet or whatever it
might be.

1399
01:05:46,990 --> 01:05:50,020
Are you a Tarot card reader?
Yeah,

1400
01:05:50,021 --> 01:05:53,260
I know it sounds a lot like Taro cards
and really some of these things

1401
01:05:53,261 --> 01:05:56,140
shouldn't be taken much more seriously
than Tarot cards,

1402
01:05:56,141 --> 01:05:58,260
but no,
I do a nice job of you.

1403
01:05:58,270 --> 01:06:00,610
So you asked,
you asked people questions like,

1404
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:03,640
um,
do you consider yourself a clean person?

1405
01:06:03,641 --> 01:06:05,410
Like strongly agree,
strongly disagree,

1406
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:08,290
where wherever in between,
and so you're filling out questions like

1407
01:06:08,291 --> 01:06:11,320
that and that's how it's kind of
determining and it's self evaluation,

1408
01:06:11,321 --> 01:06:13,300
which there's problems there or there's
this,

1409
01:06:13,330 --> 01:06:15,740
uh,
there's a website called apply apple

1410
01:06:15,741 --> 01:06:18,610
sauce.
You'd go to it in and plug it in and it

1411
01:06:18,611 --> 01:06:21,880
goes through everything you've liked on
facebook and kind of determines your

1412
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:26,710
personal traits based on that.
So if you're really low on openness,

1413
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:29,450
you're like the kind of person that's
always been in their hometown,

1414
01:06:29,470 --> 01:06:31,330
kind of why go anywhere else?

1415
01:06:31,330 --> 01:06:34,030
This is great to traveling and scary to
you.

1416
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:36,010
Your country is the best.
You haven't been to other countries,

1417
01:06:36,011 --> 01:06:39,330
but you know that your country is the
best and you're whatever church you're

1418
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:41,140
brought up in is absolutely the right
one.

1419
01:06:41,150 --> 01:06:42,700
The other one's kind of sound
ridiculous.

1420
01:06:42,701 --> 01:06:45,910
And,
and outsiders are very scary and one

1421
01:06:45,911 --> 01:06:46,840
thing that,
um,

1422
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:51,550
that psychedelics have been pretty well
studied to do now is that a single dose

1423
01:06:51,551 --> 01:06:53,770
of psychedelics will for a good amount
of time,

1424
01:06:54,090 --> 01:06:56,710
it often a year sometimes for the rest
of your life,

1425
01:06:56,980 --> 01:07:00,490
you'll be more open,
you'll rate higher in openness for the

1426
01:07:00,491 --> 01:07:03,430
rest of your life.
So people were doing more psychedelics

1427
01:07:03,431 --> 01:07:08,431
at this time and they were in.
So if you're low country or if you're

1428
01:07:08,681 --> 01:07:10,320
low in openness,
you're like,

1429
01:07:10,630 --> 01:07:13,630
you're often a pillar of the community
because you love laws.

1430
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:16,300
Laws are your favorite.
You have this nice little playbook that

1431
01:07:16,301 --> 01:07:20,020
you can live life by and you wish there
were stricter so more people would

1432
01:07:20,021 --> 01:07:21,940
follow them.
So if you're a law maker,

1433
01:07:21,941 --> 01:07:25,000
these are your favorite people.
And then if these people were,

1434
01:07:25,030 --> 01:07:26,710
you know,
young and in college and like,

1435
01:07:26,711 --> 01:07:27,431
Oh,
what the heck,

1436
01:07:27,431 --> 01:07:30,370
everyone else is doing that.
And then all of a sudden becoming more

1437
01:07:30,371 --> 01:07:34,540
open and starting to question authority.
I think it did play a little bit of a

1438
01:07:34,541 --> 01:07:36,020
factor in,
in

1439
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:39,680
I'm a little bit of the civil rights
movement.

1440
01:07:39,740 --> 01:07:43,340
So you think this was a conscious
decision by the powers that be to try to

1441
01:07:43,341 --> 01:07:46,760
limit psychedelics because they were
worried specifically about people

1442
01:07:46,761 --> 01:07:47,840
becoming more open?

1443
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:48,733
No,
I think.

1444
01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:51,380
I don't think that they understood that
what was happening.

1445
01:07:51,710 --> 01:07:53,720
I think that psychedelics had this
effect.

1446
01:07:53,721 --> 01:07:55,370
I don't,
I don't think the government knows a

1447
01:07:55,371 --> 01:07:56,350
lot,
you know,

1448
01:07:56,351 --> 01:07:56,570
I

1449
01:07:56,570 --> 01:07:58,680
do either.
But they did do those other.

1450
01:07:58,710 --> 01:08:00,890
There's quite a few,
a lot of tests that went on with,

1451
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:03,470
especially with Lsd,
with the military.

1452
01:08:03,471 --> 01:08:05,300
And then of course there was the
Harvard,

1453
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:09,920
the very famous Harvard Lsd Studies,
which there's a good argument created

1454
01:08:09,921 --> 01:08:12,020
Ted Kaczynski.
I'm sure you're aware of that,

1455
01:08:12,021 --> 01:08:12,980
right?
You know,

1456
01:08:12,981 --> 01:08:13,520
the,
uh,

1457
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:16,840
the was the German documentary,
believe it's called the net and it was

1458
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:21,470
all highlighted how Ted Kaczynski the
unibomber was a part of these lsd

1459
01:08:21,471 --> 01:08:25,130
studies at Harvard.
They fucking fried that dude's brain.

1460
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:27,350
He went to Berkeley.
He was probably crazy already,

1461
01:08:27,530 --> 01:08:29,540
but he went to Berkeley,
became a professor,

1462
01:08:29,610 --> 01:08:33,490
hoarded off all his money,
just saved enough money to implement his

1463
01:08:33,491 --> 01:08:36,920
plan and then bought that little cabin
in the woods and started killing people

1464
01:08:36,921 --> 01:08:40,100
who were involved in technology because
he was convinced because it was lsd

1465
01:08:40,101 --> 01:08:43,400
trips that and really he's right,

1466
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:47,080
exceptionally bright guy.
Is that that?

1467
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:49,690
That's.
That was what was kind of peculiar and

1468
01:08:49,691 --> 01:08:51,880
very scary about him like he was.
He was a genius.

1469
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:53,340
Well,
that's how they found him out.

1470
01:08:53,450 --> 01:08:58,450
His brother recognized his crazy
rumbling scribe from the manifesto.

1471
01:08:59,220 --> 01:09:03,240
Brother met recognize the manifesto and
probably is thinking it might be his

1472
01:09:03,241 --> 01:09:06,210
brother anyway,
because when his brother came back from

1473
01:09:06,330 --> 01:09:09,060
the lsd trips,
apparently he was absolutely convinced

1474
01:09:09,090 --> 01:09:11,850
that technology was going to be the end
of mankind,

1475
01:09:11,851 --> 01:09:15,600
that we had to stop it in its tracks,
that it was just a Trojan horse and that

1476
01:09:15,601 --> 01:09:17,040
people were creating all this
technology,

1477
01:09:17,041 --> 01:09:19,020
but he was.
He was extrapolating who's seeing the

1478
01:09:19,021 --> 01:09:21,120
future and seeing everything and he's
right.

1479
01:09:21,330 --> 01:09:21,901
He's right.
I mean,

1480
01:09:21,901 --> 01:09:25,410
this is one of the things we're talking
about today as ai becomes more and more

1481
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:26,550
of a reality.
You know,

1482
01:09:26,670 --> 01:09:28,920
even Elon Musk,
that famous speech,

1483
01:09:28,921 --> 01:09:33,060
he said that we're summoning the demon.
Like this is essentially what Ted

1484
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:35,640
Kaczynski saw.
He's just in his crazy fucking head.

1485
01:09:35,641 --> 01:09:38,540
He said,
the way to fix this is to kill the algae

1486
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:42,890
mean he's not idea poor execution.
Well,

1487
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:44,490
not even a good idea,
just a,

1488
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:46,500
an,
an odd reality.

1489
01:09:46,870 --> 01:09:48,600
The possibilities of the future.

1490
01:09:50,010 --> 01:09:51,300
Well,
so to clarify,

1491
01:09:51,301 --> 01:09:55,020
just so just so I'm not coming off like
I think it's a conspiracy.

1492
01:09:55,021 --> 01:09:56,730
I don't think the government knew any of
this stuff.

1493
01:09:56,731 --> 01:09:58,470
I don't think anyone knew a lot of these
effects.

1494
01:09:58,471 --> 01:10:00,900
I think.
I think like a lot of these cultural

1495
01:10:00,901 --> 01:10:02,130
memes are lost.
That happened.

1496
01:10:02,131 --> 01:10:05,900
It's just kind of something,
something that just kind of happened at

1497
01:10:05,901 --> 01:10:10,901
an idea that was stumbled upon that just
kind of ended up working in the interest

1498
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:13,490
of the lawmakers.
So.

1499
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:18,640
So I think people happened to start
taking more psychedelics because they're

1500
01:10:19,580 --> 01:10:22,110
popularized for therapy use and whatnot.
So.

1501
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:25,170
So it just happened to be that people
started doing second Alex and it

1502
01:10:25,171 --> 01:10:28,830
happened to be during the civil rights
movement time and when people did take

1503
01:10:28,831 --> 01:10:31,080
psychedelics,
they happen and people didn't know this

1504
01:10:31,081 --> 01:10:33,390
at the time,
happened to be opening themselves up and

1505
01:10:33,391 --> 01:10:36,330
questioning authority more because
that's what they happened to make you

1506
01:10:36,331 --> 01:10:39,540
do.
And then all of a sudden there's a lot

1507
01:10:39,541 --> 01:10:42,270
more troublemakers out there for the
government.

1508
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:43,950
And then the associate those two
together.

1509
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:46,610
That's one of the things that I find
interesting.

1510
01:10:47,090 --> 01:10:52,090
I think it was timothy leary said this,
but apparently Terence Mckenna asked

1511
01:10:52,611 --> 01:10:54,650
Timothy leary and he denied that he ever
said it.

1512
01:10:54,770 --> 01:10:57,380
So no one knows who said it,
but it was one of those guys during that

1513
01:10:57,381 --> 01:11:01,680
time said that LSD has been known to
create a,

1514
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:03,680
to cause people to go,
oh,

1515
01:11:03,890 --> 01:11:07,070
lsd has been known to cause people who
don't take it to go crazy.

1516
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:13,040
Like that's a fun way more elegant than
that.

1517
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:13,890
But,
um,

1518
01:11:13,890 --> 01:11:14,130
that

1519
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:14,940
was,
uh,

1520
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:17,700
that's really the way it is.
Like I know so many people that don't

1521
01:11:17,701 --> 01:11:19,980
smoke pot and when they hear I smoked
pot all the time,

1522
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:22,500
they're like,
what's you smoke pot all the time?

1523
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,930
Like how do you get things done?
Like potheads are lazy.

1524
01:11:24,931 --> 01:11:26,910
I'm like,
you're saying that you on smoke pot?

1525
01:11:26,911 --> 01:11:28,260
Like how can you say that?
Yeah,

1526
01:11:28,261 --> 01:11:30,420
I think it ended.
It affects everyone differently.

1527
01:11:30,421 --> 01:11:35,421
I know people that function at very high
levels and pretty much only do when

1528
01:11:35,551 --> 01:11:36,540
they're.
When they're on,

1529
01:11:36,541 --> 01:11:37,950
we'd like if,
if they,

1530
01:11:38,010 --> 01:11:40,780
if they stopped taking pot,
they become like,

1531
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:44,190
become like dumbed down.
Like it helps them.

1532
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:46,230
I don't know if it's a dependency or
whatnot but,

1533
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:49,350
but some people like motivates them and
they can clean the house.

1534
01:11:49,351 --> 01:11:53,010
They can take care of shit and it
doesn't have that effect on me.

1535
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:54,570
It makes me a little paranoid.

1536
01:11:54,570 --> 01:11:55,540
It makes me,
it,

1537
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:58,140
it dulls me down a little bit.
I feel like hm.

1538
01:11:58,830 --> 01:12:00,270
But edibles,
I like edibles,

1539
01:12:00,271 --> 01:12:03,270
don't have that effect.
We'll do different strains have an

1540
01:12:03,271 --> 01:12:05,310
effect on any differently or.
I mean,

1541
01:12:05,311 --> 01:12:08,220
I feel like I've tried a bunch of
different strains and I can't find

1542
01:12:08,221 --> 01:12:12,840
anything that I like to at the end of
the night have a hit of weed if I'm like

1543
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:15,990
by myself and watch a movie or something
like that,

1544
01:12:15,991 --> 01:12:19,620
or if I'm just hanging out with a friend
watching a movie in a social situation,

1545
01:12:20,030 --> 01:12:22,950
like I wouldn't want us.
The reason why I wouldn't want to smoke

1546
01:12:22,951 --> 01:12:26,940
weed like before doing this podcast is
because I would worry that I would get

1547
01:12:26,941 --> 01:12:31,170
in my head too much and,
and be over analyzing things.

1548
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:32,690
Well also,
you're,

1549
01:12:33,090 --> 01:12:36,180
when you're doing something like this,
it's being broadcast.

1550
01:12:36,181 --> 01:12:38,580
Like if you and I were just hanging out
together.

1551
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:41,770
Ridiculous Shit.
Yeah.

1552
01:12:42,370 --> 01:12:45,210
That's one of the things that we've done
on this podcast a million times.

1553
01:12:45,211 --> 01:12:47,370
Just just do it.
And then,

1554
01:12:47,371 --> 01:12:49,650
you know,
people say ridiculous Shit and say,

1555
01:12:49,651 --> 01:12:50,484
Oh my God.
So.

1556
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:52,320
And then people realized,
oh,

1557
01:12:52,710 --> 01:12:54,330
everybody gets retarded when they smoke
pot.

1558
01:12:54,331 --> 01:12:56,630
It's not just me.
Yeah.

1559
01:12:56,970 --> 01:12:58,800
But I think that there's,
um,

1560
01:12:59,010 --> 01:13:03,000
there's some people like you that say
that the different strains don't affect

1561
01:13:03,001 --> 01:13:05,330
them any differently.
And I don't know that they don't,

1562
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:08,280
I just can't figure out what it is,
what it is for me,

1563
01:13:08,281 --> 01:13:12,510
there's a real big difference,
particularly with like the cushions,

1564
01:13:12,870 --> 01:13:15,570
like any,
any like serious indicas,

1565
01:13:15,790 --> 01:13:18,210
like Degas have almost like a narcotic
effect.

1566
01:13:18,211 --> 01:13:19,440
I mean,
like I enjoy it,

1567
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:22,110
I enjoy it,
but it's not what I would smoke before I

1568
01:13:22,111 --> 01:13:24,630
would go on stage,
see when I now I.

1569
01:13:25,050 --> 01:13:27,630
So here's the other problem,
I guess with my,

1570
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:29,460
uh,
the way that I smoke,

1571
01:13:29,470 --> 01:13:33,930
when I first started my first got my
medical marijuana card went in to this

1572
01:13:34,110 --> 01:13:34,710
amazing.

1573
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:37,080
The first time you walk into a
dispensary is like,

1574
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:39,960
Oh my God,
the future.

1575
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:42,210
Um,
and I,

1576
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:43,200
you know,
went crazy.

1577
01:13:43,201 --> 01:13:47,370
I spent like 700 bucks.
Give me like money is no object.

1578
01:13:47,430 --> 01:13:49,800
Got Me,
I want the finest of every kind of

1579
01:13:49,801 --> 01:13:54,780
everything that you had have.
And then I realized that what happens

1580
01:13:54,781 --> 01:13:59,010
when you smoke the best of the best is
it for me.

1581
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:01,380
I have one hit and then I can't,
I can't,

1582
01:14:01,381 --> 01:14:03,000
I'm in a coma,
one hit,

1583
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:07,510
one hit and I am out or I'm like crazy
paranoid or a it.

1584
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:12,250
But so now what I do is I just get.
Usually if I'm going to get we'd rather

1585
01:14:12,251 --> 01:14:13,810
than edibles,
I just get,

1586
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:18,570
just get stuff out of the shake jar.
It's like five bucks a gram or whatever

1587
01:14:18,571 --> 01:14:20,650
the new shits on.
What is it?

1588
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:22,900
Edible breast spray.
Is that what?

1589
01:14:22,990 --> 01:14:25,290
Is it like a cbd or is it Nan?
Nan?

1590
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:28,390
No,
this would change your fucking life.

1591
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:29,463
This,
uh,

1592
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:32,870
has.
It's a thousand milligrams a dope.

1593
01:14:33,210 --> 01:14:36,280
I don't know how it works,
but you're only supposed to take six

1594
01:14:36,281 --> 01:14:39,160
pumps and you get a thousand milligrams
or something.

1595
01:14:39,161 --> 01:14:41,260
I don't know.
The whole thing is a thousand and it's

1596
01:14:41,261 --> 01:14:42,150
about,
that's not right.

1597
01:14:42,190 --> 01:14:43,990
Business agreements per spray.
This one.

1598
01:14:43,991 --> 01:14:46,270
This one 75.
Oh one.

1599
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:47,141
Yeah,
there's different.

1600
01:14:47,141 --> 01:14:49,360
Smaller three,
75 milligram.

1601
01:14:49,530 --> 01:14:52,930
The whole bottle is that much.
But milligrams of spray.

1602
01:14:53,230 --> 01:14:53,770
Yeah.
Yeah.

1603
01:14:53,770 --> 01:14:54,610
Can I try it?
Yup.

1604
01:14:54,910 --> 01:14:58,510
That's probably under my tongue.
And then I think there's some that are

1605
01:14:58,511 --> 01:15:00,580
more potent.
This one's the most potent.

1606
01:15:00,910 --> 01:15:02,560
Anyway,
this one that's the most potent.

1607
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:05,280
This is the thousand.
This was like a thousand milligrams

1608
01:15:05,290 --> 01:15:07,210
brown and you're not supposed to eat the
whole thing at one time.

1609
01:15:07,211 --> 01:15:08,830
You supposed to take like a nibble.
Well,

1610
01:15:08,831 --> 01:15:12,250
he makes it 1,502,
which is really problematic.

1611
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:16,280
What I like about edibles is,
is how it's measured in.

1612
01:15:16,330 --> 01:15:19,840
There seems to be like a little
difference in between brands and stuff,

1613
01:15:19,841 --> 01:15:24,841
but I know five milligrams now thing 10
milligrams just kind of feel a little

1614
01:15:25,031 --> 01:15:26,560
good.
Fifteen milligrams.

1615
01:15:26,561 --> 01:15:31,561
I'm starting to get high 20 now I'm high
25 now I'm really high and I don't do

1616
01:15:31,811 --> 01:15:36,220
more than that.
I took 10 sprays and then did a podcast

1617
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:39,910
and I was shitting my pants.
I think it might have been 12.

1618
01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:43,570
I might've done 12,
12 sprays and I did a podcast where the

1619
01:15:43,571 --> 01:15:46,150
whole time was doing the podcast as I
was skiing downhill.

1620
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:49,290
Just hoping I didn't have to change like
an opening.

1621
01:15:49,310 --> 01:15:51,670
I didn't have to turn or avoided another
skier.

1622
01:15:51,910 --> 01:15:52,930
I was like,
oh Jesus.

1623
01:15:53,260 --> 01:15:54,430
Oh Jesus.
Stay up.

1624
01:15:54,670 --> 01:15:57,220
Just stay up.
Yeah,

1625
01:15:57,221 --> 01:15:58,380
I uh,
I,

1626
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:01,600
I,
I've been high on stage probably 20

1627
01:16:01,601 --> 01:16:04,840
times in my,
I've been doing comedy for like 12 years

1628
01:16:04,841 --> 01:16:09,841
or something like that and I probably
had 10 of those times where I felt like

1629
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:15,310
I was giggling and having fun and it
helped the show and then I had 10 of

1630
01:16:15,311 --> 01:16:18,760
those times where I was just like,
I couldn't think straight,

1631
01:16:18,761 --> 01:16:22,480
I couldn't remember anything and it's
just not worth the risk for me.

1632
01:16:22,570 --> 01:16:23,440
It's total crap.
Shoot.

1633
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:24,340
Yeah.
I,

1634
01:16:24,341 --> 01:16:28,660
one time I,
I said the setup of one joke with the

1635
01:16:28,661 --> 01:16:33,661
punch line of another joke and at the
time like it was just a really hot

1636
01:16:33,850 --> 01:16:38,500
audience and I was doing really well and
at the time they laughed and I was like,

1637
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:40,480
I realized why I was like,
wait a second,

1638
01:16:41,110 --> 01:16:44,860
what are you guys laughing at?
And then I went back and I told both

1639
01:16:44,890 --> 01:16:47,460
jokes and explained what I screwed up.
So I like,

1640
01:16:47,461 --> 01:16:50,860
so I don't know what the fuck you guys
were laughing because what I said made

1641
01:16:50,861 --> 01:16:53,410
no sense.
Maybe it was just my inflection was

1642
01:16:53,411 --> 01:16:55,210
funny or something like that.
Wow,

1643
01:16:55,211 --> 01:16:56,230
that's funny.
Yeah.

1644
01:16:56,410 --> 01:16:58,200
Maybe they didn't want to seem stupid.
Yeah.

1645
01:16:58,201 --> 01:16:59,560
Yeah.
It's like one of those Dennis Miller

1646
01:16:59,561 --> 01:17:02,650
things laugh at as reference.
Oh yes.

1647
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,600
You know,
it was a heartbreaker for me.

1648
01:17:04,601 --> 01:17:06,580
Somebody told me he doesn't really know
what he's talking about,

1649
01:17:06,581 --> 01:17:11,030
that he just comes up with these really
obscure because they work well in a joke

1650
01:17:11,031 --> 01:17:13,010
for him.
Mcdonald told me that,

1651
01:17:13,150 --> 01:17:14,660
hey,
he doesn't even know those things.

1652
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:15,863
I'm like,
what?

1653
01:17:16,310 --> 01:17:18,080
Come on.
Yeah,

1654
01:17:18,230 --> 01:17:20,630
there is.
I just had a podcast talking with a guy,

1655
01:17:20,631 --> 01:17:24,620
like one of the reasons why we laugh at
things is because is because you're,

1656
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:28,220
you're conveying that you have that same
knowledge.

1657
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:29,480
You know,
that you get it,

1658
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:31,820
that you understand the context for it
or whatever.

1659
01:17:31,821 --> 01:17:36,821
It's like advertising that you also know
this or you want to be in with the cool

1660
01:17:37,850 --> 01:17:40,070
crowd.
Crowd knows the joke.

1661
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:41,450
Ah,
that's hilarious.

1662
01:17:41,451 --> 01:17:42,031
Yeah.
Yeah.

1663
01:17:42,031 --> 01:17:43,060
Is it hilarious,
Shane?

1664
01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:47,790
Because I want you to like me.
I know

1665
01:17:49,450 --> 01:17:51,290
it's weird that a lot of the,
some,

1666
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:54,290
and I have plenty of movie references
and stuff now,

1667
01:17:54,291 --> 01:17:56,300
but it's,
it seems like a lot of the,

1668
01:17:56,930 --> 01:17:57,560
the,
uh,

1669
01:17:57,560 --> 01:18:01,490
quote unquote like smart comedy these
days is just like movie references.

1670
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:02,031
It's like,
well,

1671
01:18:02,031 --> 01:18:06,080
why is that you watch a lot of TV,
like I don't get why that's smart that,

1672
01:18:06,081 --> 01:18:09,550
you know,
of this obscure show that like you just

1673
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:10,930
watch tv,
you want,

1674
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:12,800
you're going to alt rooms or something
is that,

1675
01:18:12,801 --> 01:18:14,870
is that happens in all rooms.
That's kind of.

1676
01:18:15,410 --> 01:18:17,750
But I mean I like art rooms as well,
but,

1677
01:18:17,751 --> 01:18:19,070
um,
but I,

1678
01:18:19,150 --> 01:18:23,540
I see that sometimes where I'm like,
that's just a movie that no one knows

1679
01:18:23,541 --> 01:18:26,780
about that you watched.
Like I don't get why that's smart.

1680
01:18:26,810 --> 01:18:29,580
That's not,
it's not like addictive.

1681
01:18:29,590 --> 01:18:31,400
Um,
intelligence is just like,

1682
01:18:31,430 --> 01:18:32,840
OOO,
other people don't know that.

1683
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:34,460
So it seems like it's smart,
right?

1684
01:18:34,461 --> 01:18:36,350
You're clever because you remembered
something,

1685
01:18:36,470 --> 01:18:37,880
right.
That's pointless.

1686
01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:42,890
That was a complete waste of time.
So back to this Kratom stuff,

1687
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:44,510
would you buy it?
Um,

1688
01:18:44,511 --> 01:18:48,110
you can get it on a head shop or you can
get it online for about another week.

1689
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:51,690
That is so crazy.
And so then once it becomes schedule

1690
01:18:51,691 --> 01:18:53,960
one,
then it's like pot or heroin.

1691
01:18:53,961 --> 01:18:55,430
Like if you get caught with it,
you're going to jail.

1692
01:18:55,730 --> 01:18:56,570
Yeah,
I don't.

1693
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:01,610
I mean the schedules don't necessarily
affect what the penalties are.

1694
01:19:01,611 --> 01:19:05,300
Like you'll get in more trouble for a
scheduled to cocaine then you will a

1695
01:19:05,310 --> 01:19:07,760
schedule one marijuana.
Um,

1696
01:19:07,820 --> 01:19:10,540
but so I don't know what the actual
penalties will be for,

1697
01:19:10,570 --> 01:19:12,260
but yeah,
I think it will be a scheduled one.

1698
01:19:12,261 --> 01:19:14,750
So they didn't have to establish
penalties but to the established

1699
01:19:14,751 --> 01:19:16,370
penalties based on science.
I mean,

1700
01:19:16,371 --> 01:19:19,190
did they have any logic behind what
they're saying or they just know.

1701
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:19,631
I mean,
I,

1702
01:19:19,631 --> 01:19:23,000
I don't think they,
I don't think they establish and any

1703
01:19:23,001 --> 01:19:26,330
penalties based on science.
I don't think our prison system,

1704
01:19:26,570 --> 01:19:29,780
I think if the scientists were running
the prison system,

1705
01:19:29,870 --> 01:19:32,630
they would get scrap it and start all
over.

1706
01:19:32,631 --> 01:19:34,850
It'd be about reforming and
rehabilitation,

1707
01:19:34,851 --> 01:19:37,880
which is what it's supposed to be about.
And uh,

1708
01:19:37,881 --> 01:19:38,990
yeah,
I don't think.

1709
01:19:39,590 --> 01:19:44,590
I don't think we're doing great science
with our prison system in any way he

1710
01:19:44,691 --> 01:19:47,510
had.
The whole thing is just one person

1711
01:19:47,511 --> 01:19:51,680
telling another person what they can and
cannot put in their body where you can't

1712
01:19:51,681 --> 01:19:53,480
demonstrate that it's hurting anybody
else,

1713
01:19:53,481 --> 01:19:55,550
but that person,
to me that's like,

1714
01:19:55,551 --> 01:19:56,540
okay,
if that's the case,

1715
01:19:56,570 --> 01:19:59,720
well why is it okay to rock climb?
It was rock climbing is obviously

1716
01:19:59,721 --> 01:20:01,670
dangerous.
Why is it okay to Bungee jump?

1717
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:04,200
Why is it okay to jump out of airplanes?
Yeah,

1718
01:20:04,230 --> 01:20:07,170
that stuff's all legal,
but you can't take this kratom stuff and

1719
01:20:07,171 --> 01:20:08,004
you can.

1720
01:20:08,110 --> 01:20:09,540
I mean,
you can,

1721
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:12,060
uh,
where is it that they,

1722
01:20:12,150 --> 01:20:17,150
that they use those bullet ants and like
put them on their hands and like you can

1723
01:20:17,881 --> 01:20:22,881
trip doing that from the pain.
The pain is so intense that they trip

1724
01:20:23,161 --> 01:20:25,020
like they do with this during
ceremonies.

1725
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:30,050
You can run a marathon and get into a
transcendental state because your body's

1726
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:34,530
going through such torture that it goes
into this different part of your brain

1727
01:20:34,531 --> 01:20:37,080
that pushes you through it.
And um,

1728
01:20:37,350 --> 01:20:39,780
I mean you can hallucinate from lack of
sleep.

1729
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:40,840
Um,
I,

1730
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:43,620
I,
for for like six months in my life,

1731
01:20:43,621 --> 01:20:46,890
I was trying to do the thing where every
two hours you sleep for like 20 minutes

1732
01:20:46,891 --> 01:20:49,860
or whatever for how long,
like six months.

1733
01:20:50,630 --> 01:20:53,250
Yeah.
I like trying like crazy weird different

1734
01:20:53,251 --> 01:20:56,760
things and um,
I go on all these weird different kicks.

1735
01:20:56,780 --> 01:20:58,260
Um,
it was a nightmare.

1736
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:01,800
I started hallucinating after awhile.
So explain every two hours you sleep for

1737
01:21:01,801 --> 01:21:04,710
20 minutes.
I would set the alarm for like 20

1738
01:21:04,711 --> 01:21:09,070
minutes and yeah,
you know,

1739
01:21:09,380 --> 01:21:12,420
so I was,
it was before as a comedian and it was,

1740
01:21:12,421 --> 01:21:15,270
I was trying to,
I was trying to,

1741
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:19,200
I was working third shift in a factory
and then at the same time I was going to

1742
01:21:19,201 --> 01:21:21,660
school,
like just tech school for like a backup

1743
01:21:21,661 --> 01:21:22,980
plan.
I wanted to be a comedian,

1744
01:21:22,981 --> 01:21:25,640
but I also like very scared and didn't
know how to start and,

1745
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:30,720
and um,
and so I was taking like 16 or 18

1746
01:21:30,721 --> 01:21:33,150
credits or something like that.
And um,

1747
01:21:33,270 --> 01:21:36,090
and then,
and I also had a social life,

1748
01:21:36,091 --> 01:21:38,880
so I was every two hours I just had a
time to take a nap.

1749
01:21:39,150 --> 01:21:41,340
And the crazy thing was,
is all ran together.

1750
01:21:41,341 --> 01:21:44,430
So if I,
if I was in there for a lecture,

1751
01:21:44,431 --> 01:21:46,320
um,
Monday and then,

1752
01:21:46,610 --> 01:21:48,780
and then on Friday there was a test on
it.

1753
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:51,360
It was as if I just heard it,
it was like,

1754
01:21:51,361 --> 01:21:52,920
it was all one day,
it was like,

1755
01:21:52,921 --> 01:21:56,490
can't we just talked about this
really weird.

1756
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:59,580
And then I tried taking supplements and
stuff like that too,

1757
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:04,581
like do energy boosting things and um,
and then one day,

1758
01:22:05,910 --> 01:22:10,500
one day my eye,
I got anal leakage from like all these

1759
01:22:10,770 --> 01:22:15,090
supplements I was taking and then I
decided to stop doing that.

1760
01:22:15,091 --> 01:22:18,630
It was just like,
it was like a Tan,

1761
01:22:18,990 --> 01:22:23,100
a oily
oil.

1762
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,030
And I was like,
you know what,

1763
01:22:25,090 --> 01:22:27,910
this isn't worth it.
And I and I dropped out of school,

1764
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:33,090
Jesus Christ and started sleeping
regularly and a weird life.

1765
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:34,980
So if you went out like at 9:00 at
night,

1766
01:22:34,981 --> 01:22:37,860
you and your friends went out,
would you go somewhere at 11 and take a

1767
01:22:37,861 --> 01:22:38,950
nap?
Oh yeah,

1768
01:22:39,690 --> 01:22:41,490
yeah.
I couldn't go out that often.

1769
01:22:41,491 --> 01:22:44,800
But then most of the most ridiculous
things I've ever heard,

1770
01:22:45,110 --> 01:22:49,830
which she takes 20 minutes,
two hours later,

1771
01:22:49,831 --> 01:22:50,700
hey,
you guys want to eat?

1772
01:22:50,701 --> 01:22:54,330
And I got to take a nap.
I'll meet you guys there.

1773
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:57,060
The thing was,
if you didn't like follow the schedule

1774
01:22:57,090 --> 01:22:59,880
really strictly is when,
when you'd get fucked.

1775
01:22:59,881 --> 01:23:03,060
So if I did end up having some drinks or
something like that and hanging out with

1776
01:23:03,061 --> 01:23:06,100
friends and not doing that nap or if I
was at work in

1777
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:08,060
like,
I wouldn't get my break when I suppose

1778
01:23:08,061 --> 01:23:09,430
to,
um,

1779
01:23:09,670 --> 01:23:11,230
it would,
it would really fucked me up.

1780
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:13,870
And I started hallucinating when I was
driving.

1781
01:23:13,871 --> 01:23:16,730
I fell asleep behind the wheel once and,
and uh,

1782
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:19,720
like almost crashed my car,
went into a ditch and was able to drive

1783
01:23:19,721 --> 01:23:21,120
out of it.
And so I,

1784
01:23:21,140 --> 01:23:23,050
I've put an end to that experiment.
But yeah,

1785
01:23:23,051 --> 01:23:25,540
last week I couldn't believe I did it
for as long as I did.

1786
01:23:25,570 --> 01:23:27,130
Looking back on it,
it's like,

1787
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:29,410
it didn't seem that crazy to me at the
time.

1788
01:23:29,411 --> 01:23:30,130
I don't know why.

1789
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:35,130
What is that?
What is a 12 hours at 20 minutes?

1790
01:23:35,171 --> 01:23:37,210
Because it's half,
it's double right every,

1791
01:23:37,211 --> 01:23:40,180
every two hours.
So 12 hours at 20 minutes.

1792
01:23:40,510 --> 01:23:42,430
So you were,
you're essentially sleeping in.

1793
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:44,610
So yeah,
like four hours a day I guess,

1794
01:23:46,190 --> 01:23:50,210
but by doing it in these long stretches
where two hours and 20 minutes,

1795
01:23:50,211 --> 01:23:53,000
two hours and 20 minutes.
You never really get into like heavy rem

1796
01:23:53,001 --> 01:23:53,834
sleep or.

1797
01:23:53,850 --> 01:23:55,050
No,
I don't think so.

1798
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:56,030
I mean I,
I would,

1799
01:23:56,030 --> 01:23:58,770
I would start to,
I would like wake up in a little bit of

1800
01:23:58,771 --> 01:24:00,720
a dream state.
Yeah.

1801
01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:02,280
It was weird.
Weird.

1802
01:24:02,281 --> 01:24:04,020
Don't recommend it.
Did it for six months.

1803
01:24:04,021 --> 01:24:05,660
Yeah.
That's amazing that you have that kind

1804
01:24:05,661 --> 01:24:10,320
of like sticktuitiveness
when I get focused on something like.

1805
01:24:10,321 --> 01:24:11,400
Yeah.
Um,

1806
01:24:11,490 --> 01:24:12,960
but yeah,
I mean the point is,

1807
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,770
is there's a million ways to trip.
You can't stop people from tripping.

1808
01:24:16,830 --> 01:24:18,810
Have you done the holotropic breathing
thing?

1809
01:24:18,980 --> 01:24:20,010
Um,
no,

1810
01:24:20,011 --> 01:24:22,110
but I just started hearing about this
recently.

1811
01:24:22,111 --> 01:24:23,050
Can you explain it to me?

1812
01:24:23,290 --> 01:24:25,180
Done it.
I've had a friend and my friend rob has

1813
01:24:25,181 --> 01:24:27,320
done it several times.
There's a,

1814
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:30,040
there's people who really know how to do
it correctly.

1815
01:24:30,041 --> 01:24:33,730
There's a couple of different states.
Wolfen or what's that guy's name?

1816
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:34,120
No,
no.

1817
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:38,350
Wim Hoff Hoff.
Similar Wim Hof has some pretty some

1818
01:24:38,351 --> 01:24:40,360
psychedelic aspects to his breathing
technique.

1819
01:24:40,361 --> 01:24:42,280
I think too.
It definitely puts you in a state of

1820
01:24:42,281 --> 01:24:44,680
mind,
but the holotropic breathing thing,

1821
01:24:44,681 --> 01:24:47,740
somehow or another,
it forces your body into a psychedelic

1822
01:24:47,741 --> 01:24:49,450
state.
I've had actually a couple people that

1823
01:24:49,451 --> 01:24:51,040
have done it.
It takes awhile,

1824
01:24:51,250 --> 01:24:54,450
but through the specific style of
breathing cv find it Jamie.

1825
01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:56,410
So we could tell people what the fuck
we're talking about.

1826
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:58,750
I haven't done it obviously,
but um,

1827
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:02,500
I know of several people who do
Kundalini Yoga,

1828
01:25:02,830 --> 01:25:07,720
who have also done dmt and they say that
through coon Daleney practice.

1829
01:25:07,721 --> 01:25:10,000
When you get deep into it on a regular
basis,

1830
01:25:10,001 --> 01:25:14,590
when you do it daily,
you can achieve dmt like states on the

1831
01:25:14,591 --> 01:25:15,400
natch.

1832
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:18,610
Well,
I went since doing dmt.

1833
01:25:18,611 --> 01:25:23,611
Now if I much mushrooms I can meditate
myself into a dmt state for like five to

1834
01:25:24,401 --> 01:25:26,900
10 minutes while you're on mushrooms.
Um,

1835
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:28,630
I,
I did mushrooms in a float tank

1836
01:25:28,660 --> 01:25:30,930
recently.
I the.

1837
01:25:31,690 --> 01:25:34,690
And that was,
I don't know if it's because of how much

1838
01:25:34,691 --> 01:25:37,840
dmt I do or whatever,
but that was like a dmt trip to me.

1839
01:25:37,930 --> 01:25:40,840
Yeah,
it was like a little more controlled and

1840
01:25:40,841 --> 01:25:42,970
I could pop out of it anytime that I
wanted to.

1841
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:47,260
But that was like for four.
I mean it would take me like five

1842
01:25:47,261 --> 01:25:49,740
minutes to get into it.
Um,

1843
01:25:50,110 --> 01:25:55,110
and then within five minutes,
I mean I had music playing inside of my

1844
01:25:55,721 --> 01:25:59,950
head and like these crazy,
like dmt stories happening in different

1845
01:25:59,951 --> 01:26:04,720
worlds that I was seeing and like
palaces and unlike other areas with like

1846
01:26:04,730 --> 01:26:07,040
scary,
weird clowns and stuff like that.

1847
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:10,010
I was,
I mean I was the best trip of my life

1848
01:26:10,011 --> 01:26:14,630
and it was like full on hallucinations
because I did float tanks a couple times

1849
01:26:14,631 --> 01:26:16,820
just sober and I never really saw
anything.

1850
01:26:16,850 --> 01:26:19,760
I didn't like hallucinate or anything.
It was just kinda like meditation on

1851
01:26:19,761 --> 01:26:20,800
steroids.
I felt like

1852
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:22,690
that definitely like meditation on
steroids,

1853
01:26:22,691 --> 01:26:26,460
but flow tanks or something where the
more comfortable you get with the more

1854
01:26:26,630 --> 01:26:28,900
experience,
the easier you slip into it.

1855
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:32,470
So the quicker you slip into it into
like when I go into it,

1856
01:26:32,471 --> 01:26:36,460
I've done it so many times now because
it's in my house that I lay down and my

1857
01:26:36,461 --> 01:26:37,630
body goes up.
Here we go again.

1858
01:26:37,690 --> 01:26:40,750
Good to good times.
Just relaxed like I've done it.

1859
01:26:40,751 --> 01:26:43,540
Like it's not like when we go to,
can't believe I'm floating like those

1860
01:26:43,541 --> 01:26:47,320
states of mind that you get to when
you're in that I don't.

1861
01:26:47,350 --> 01:26:49,840
I can't believe I'm floating thing.
It takes you a while to relax.

1862
01:26:50,230 --> 01:26:52,240
Floating around.
You're bumping against the wall.

1863
01:26:52,241 --> 01:26:56,470
You're trying to center yourself.
I think that state though combined with

1864
01:26:56,471 --> 01:26:58,960
the mushrooms,
this has gotta be an accelerant.

1865
01:26:59,140 --> 01:27:03,360
Yeah.
So you've done that mushrooms and ended

1866
01:27:03,370 --> 01:27:05,140
up bringing on hallucinations for you as
well.

1867
01:27:05,540 --> 01:27:09,140
The strongest hallucinations honestly is
from too much edibles.

1868
01:27:09,770 --> 01:27:13,170
I've had too much edibles where I went
into the tank where I just got to when

1869
01:27:13,180 --> 01:27:18,180
we're going to die and you get in there
and I just have had full blown.

1870
01:27:18,860 --> 01:27:23,860
I had this one insane intense experience
where I felt like I was in a jungle,

1871
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:29,600
like I was in a jungle and I was walking
through the jungle with these people and

1872
01:27:29,930 --> 01:27:34,930
they were all speaking the language and
I understood the language and in my mind

1873
01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:38,390
I was thinking in their language and
then I realized it.

1874
01:27:38,391 --> 01:27:39,290
I went,
oh my God,

1875
01:27:39,291 --> 01:27:41,420
I'm thinking of this other lane,
and then I'm out of it.

1876
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:45,110
It went away,
but for the brief few moments where it

1877
01:27:45,111 --> 01:27:48,230
happened,
I mean I could remember feeling that the

1878
01:27:48,590 --> 01:27:53,590
dew on the ground and feeling the leaves
under my feet and walking through the

1879
01:27:54,081 --> 01:27:55,310
jungle with these people.

1880
01:27:56,150 --> 01:28:00,230
There's a lot of folks that believe that
the reason why we have instincts,

1881
01:28:00,260 --> 01:28:02,870
the reason why you know,
like an animal comes out of its mother's

1882
01:28:03,470 --> 01:28:07,060
body immediately goes to the breast and
instinctively start sucking at.

1883
01:28:07,070 --> 01:28:12,070
There's certain data that's just encoded
in our body and when it comes from is

1884
01:28:12,230 --> 01:28:16,670
the experiences of all the different
beings that existed before us,

1885
01:28:16,671 --> 01:28:20,930
that bread and eventually became us.
That this is just massive database of

1886
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:23,900
experiences.
All your ancestors and they're all sort

1887
01:28:23,901 --> 01:28:27,650
of collected together.
So the idea is that occasionally you can

1888
01:28:27,710 --> 01:28:32,450
tap into some distant memory that's a
locked in like,

1889
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:33,560
oh,
look what I found.

1890
01:28:33,590 --> 01:28:35,720
It's our high school yearbook.
This is crazy.

1891
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:40,850
And you open up what's essentially your
Dnas high school yearbook from some

1892
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:45,650
fucking Subsaharan experience when you
were half a monkey person.

1893
01:28:45,870 --> 01:28:48,780
Yeah.
Lakers are stored in DNA or something

1894
01:28:48,781 --> 01:28:49,614
like that.
Uh,

1895
01:28:49,660 --> 01:28:52,050
so that's,
I mean my,

1896
01:28:52,250 --> 01:28:54,740
my scientific mind would just say that,
you know,

1897
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:59,760
it genes that are set up to have this
inclination to uh,

1898
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:03,770
suck on your tits ended up being,
um,

1899
01:29:04,100 --> 01:29:06,120
passed on easier and,
and uh,

1900
01:29:06,250 --> 01:29:07,890
and whatnot.
But I have,

1901
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:09,940
I've had full on.
I,

1902
01:29:10,390 --> 01:29:14,400
I remember specifically,
I had a mushroom trip like 10 years ago

1903
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:18,510
where I must have taken a ton.
What happened was I was blackout drunk,

1904
01:29:18,650 --> 01:29:21,000
I took mushrooms,
I don't remember any of it.

1905
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:25,200
And then I must've passed out and I just
woke up a trip.

1906
01:29:25,330 --> 01:29:27,420
I didn't know.
It took me like a couple minutes to

1907
01:29:27,421 --> 01:29:28,830
realize what was going on.
I was like,

1908
01:29:28,831 --> 01:29:30,360
am I dreaming?
Did I go crazy?

1909
01:29:30,361 --> 01:29:31,170
What happened,
I was like,

1910
01:29:31,170 --> 01:29:33,240
Oh,
I had mushrooms in the fridge.

1911
01:29:33,241 --> 01:29:34,620
I bet I gobbled those things.

1912
01:29:35,010 --> 01:29:40,010
And then I closed my eyes and I saw,
I saw like inside my brain was kind of

1913
01:29:40,621 --> 01:29:42,450
like a,
um,

1914
01:29:43,110 --> 01:29:46,230
the opening scene of fight club with
like electricity shooting around

1915
01:29:46,231 --> 01:29:47,011
different neurons,
blah,

1916
01:29:47,011 --> 01:29:49,500
blah blah.
And then it zoomed in and then I saw

1917
01:29:49,501 --> 01:29:52,830
like an individual neuron and then it
zoomed in and then I saw like a strip of

1918
01:29:52,831 --> 01:29:57,831
DNA and then it zoomed in and then I saw
like this little section of Dna and then

1919
01:29:57,911 --> 01:30:02,280
I,
and then it just exploded and I saw all

1920
01:30:02,281 --> 01:30:05,340
of life,
like going all the way back to.

1921
01:30:05,550 --> 01:30:07,410
So,
so I saw like all these different

1922
01:30:07,411 --> 01:30:11,520
battles and stuff and I'm like my
ancestors.

1923
01:30:11,521 --> 01:30:15,420
And then it went all the way back to
like being monkeys and all that and went

1924
01:30:15,421 --> 01:30:18,840
back to like this first little plant,
see the,

1925
01:30:18,841 --> 01:30:23,841
like springing spring sprouting and uh,
and then it was over.

1926
01:30:24,331 --> 01:30:26,070
And that's not.
I mean,

1927
01:30:26,130 --> 01:30:29,010
it wasn't,
it wasn't an accurate representation of

1928
01:30:29,011 --> 01:30:32,280
the history of evolution,
but it's still insane that my brain was

1929
01:30:32,281 --> 01:30:34,080
able to do that.
Pardon me?

1930
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:35,380
Creativity though,
I mean,

1931
01:30:35,381 --> 01:30:38,560
isn't that you're bringing on mushrooms,
absorbing information that you already

1932
01:30:38,561 --> 01:30:41,470
know,
sort of manipulating it and

1933
01:30:41,710 --> 01:30:43,720
I think so.
I think it will be hard to have a

1934
01:30:43,721 --> 01:30:44,590
mechanism where

1935
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:47,210
memories are stored and the problem with
that,

1936
01:30:47,300 --> 01:30:50,660
there's been studies done that show that
they exist and here's what they did.

1937
01:30:50,661 --> 01:30:55,661
They took these rats or mice and they
put a citrus spray in the air and then

1938
01:30:56,541 --> 01:30:59,150
they electrocuted their feet,
so every time they sprayed the citrus

1939
01:30:59,151 --> 01:31:01,240
smell,
they gave them a charge on their feet

1940
01:31:01,241 --> 01:31:05,480
and they're hurt them.
Their children who never experienced any

1941
01:31:05,481 --> 01:31:09,380
of this,
their DNA from these mice created these

1942
01:31:09,381 --> 01:31:10,910
children.
The children,

1943
01:31:10,940 --> 01:31:14,570
they would spray the citrus spray in the
air and they would automatically have

1944
01:31:14,571 --> 01:31:17,210
this terror response.
Like they would freak out.

1945
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:20,330
They have accelerated panic level,
measurable.

1946
01:31:20,660 --> 01:31:23,420
So they realized,
and they weren't pregnant when they did

1947
01:31:23,421 --> 01:31:24,480
this or anything,
Huh?

1948
01:31:24,530 --> 01:31:25,400
Nope.
Nope.

1949
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:27,590
They.
They had a significant amount of time

1950
01:31:27,650 --> 01:31:31,550
between the actual experiences and uh,
when they're pregnant and you know,

1951
01:31:31,910 --> 01:31:33,260
rats and mice and shit,
they're,

1952
01:31:33,261 --> 01:31:37,820
they're not pregnant for very long.
Like I think a rat is pregnant for like

1953
01:31:37,821 --> 01:31:41,210
16 days or something like that.
And then they give birth,

1954
01:31:41,250 --> 01:31:42,980
something crazy like that.
I think that's what I am.

1955
01:31:42,981 --> 01:31:44,090
A hamster.
Maybe I'm,

1956
01:31:44,150 --> 01:31:47,660
maybe I'm confusing hamster,
but a hamster is pregnant for like 16

1957
01:31:47,661 --> 01:31:50,630
days and shit's out a letter and then 16
days later get pregnant again.

1958
01:31:51,260 --> 01:31:54,920
They could just,
so 21 days for a wrap.

1959
01:31:55,070 --> 01:31:55,903
Okay.
So,

1960
01:31:55,910 --> 01:31:57,230
um,
so it's real quick.

1961
01:31:57,320 --> 01:31:59,920
So they did these studies,
they,

1962
01:32:00,150 --> 01:32:03,910
they torture these little nieces,
zap their feet with that citrus spray in

1963
01:32:03,911 --> 01:32:07,900
the air and then there's a clear
indication that that memory of that

1964
01:32:07,901 --> 01:32:11,230
smell being attached to danger was
transmitted to their children.

1965
01:32:12,940 --> 01:32:13,950
That's incredible.
Yeah.

1966
01:32:14,650 --> 01:32:16,870
So this is why I think,
well,

1967
01:32:17,110 --> 01:32:18,700
it only makes sense.
I mean,

1968
01:32:18,701 --> 01:32:22,030
I don't know why people would be
incredulous about it because how else do

1969
01:32:22,031 --> 01:32:23,200
we get all these instincts?
I mean,

1970
01:32:23,201 --> 01:32:27,160
why would we assume that memories are
not somehow or another stored in the

1971
01:32:27,161 --> 01:32:30,540
very genetic meet like well members and
more bright?

1972
01:32:30,541 --> 01:32:32,620
It's in my hard drive.
I take it out.

1973
01:32:32,621 --> 01:32:35,590
I move it around.
Know your memory somehow or another is

1974
01:32:35,591 --> 01:32:38,410
in your consciousness.
We don't exactly know where.

1975
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:40,810
We know when areas of the brain get
injured.

1976
01:32:40,811 --> 01:32:44,080
It affects memory.
We know that it could very well be that

1977
01:32:44,110 --> 01:32:46,510
the areas of the brain are involved in
processing memory,

1978
01:32:46,660 --> 01:32:48,430
not necessarily storing memory.

1979
01:32:48,670 --> 01:32:50,870
We don't know really.
Whoa.

1980
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:55,030
Realistically that there's only one a,
like there's certain things like dmt is

1981
01:32:55,031 --> 01:32:58,120
produced not just in the brain but it's
also produced in the liver and in the

1982
01:32:58,121 --> 01:32:59,650
lungs.
They know this for a fact,

1983
01:32:59,890 --> 01:33:04,890
so it's one of those things where maybe
other things are stored in other parts

1984
01:33:06,221 --> 01:33:09,850
of the body.
We just assume that the very body itself

1985
01:33:09,970 --> 01:33:13,240
doesn't have some sort of memory,
but you know when you talk to people

1986
01:33:13,241 --> 01:33:16,420
that have limbs that have been removed,
they have phantom itches and things

1987
01:33:16,421 --> 01:33:19,930
along those lines.
That's one explanation for that

1988
01:33:19,931 --> 01:33:22,380
phenomenon is that you have a memory.
Your,

1989
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:25,090
your actual tissue has a memory of that
limb.

1990
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:27,500
Hmm.
I,

1991
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:29,860
um,
well there's also a body map in,

1992
01:33:29,940 --> 01:33:32,770
in the brain and um,
yeah,

1993
01:33:32,771 --> 01:33:34,270
maybe that's why she's a good example.
Yeah.

1994
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:36,220
But the mice examples,
probably the best one.

1995
01:33:36,430 --> 01:33:39,040
Well,
it does make me think of how,

1996
01:33:39,130 --> 01:33:42,280
um,
how information from our environment

1997
01:33:42,460 --> 01:33:43,820
can,
um,

1998
01:33:43,990 --> 01:33:48,040
can affect the fetal environment.
Like females,

1999
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:54,240
females in lower income places or are in
lower parts of the social kind of

2000
01:33:55,650 --> 01:34:00,550
hierarchy in humans will tend to have.
And there's all these different species

2001
01:34:00,551 --> 01:34:03,580
that have where the species can kind of
pick,

2002
01:34:03,940 --> 01:34:06,280
depending on the environment,
whether it's going to be a male or

2003
01:34:06,281 --> 01:34:11,281
female.
So lower status females tend to have a

2004
01:34:11,351 --> 01:34:16,150
daughter is more in like the kings that
are higher status tend to have more sons

2005
01:34:16,151 --> 01:34:18,250
because sons,
sons,

2006
01:34:18,251 --> 01:34:22,360
if they're doing very well,
have the opportunity to make a bunch and

2007
01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:24,400
spread their genes on quite a bit more.

2008
01:34:24,610 --> 01:34:26,200
Um,
but a female,

2009
01:34:26,201 --> 01:34:29,470
even if it's like a lower status female
or low income or whatever,

2010
01:34:29,471 --> 01:34:31,840
female can always have at least a couple
of children.

2011
01:34:31,841 --> 01:34:35,170
Whereas a lot of men get kind of our
evolutionary dead ends,

2012
01:34:35,230 --> 01:34:35,950
you know,
if,

2013
01:34:35,950 --> 01:34:39,520
if a dudes brought up poor,
he's going to have a harder time finding

2014
01:34:39,610 --> 01:34:41,380
a mate basically.
So.

2015
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:45,820
So it does seem like there's some
environmental influence that is somehow

2016
01:34:45,821 --> 01:34:50,821
recognized in the brain that has been
kind of selecting a little bit better

2017
01:34:51,131 --> 01:34:53,650
than chance whether you're going to have
like a male or female.

2018
01:34:53,651 --> 01:34:58,010
So there might be other mechanisms in
there like that can affect.

2019
01:34:58,430 --> 01:34:59,241
I just.
Yeah,

2020
01:34:59,241 --> 01:35:02,180
I can't conceptualize how,
how it would work,

2021
01:35:02,181 --> 01:35:03,140
but that's interesting.
I have,

2022
01:35:03,230 --> 01:35:06,770
I've read other studies like that and I
don't know enough about them,

2023
01:35:06,780 --> 01:35:07,613
haven't read it,

2024
01:35:08,030 --> 01:35:09,750
conceptualize why,
uh,

2025
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:12,770
there would be a strong connection
between that smell,

2026
01:35:12,771 --> 01:35:14,480
which was always followed by an
electrocution.

2027
01:35:14,481 --> 01:35:16,760
That it's somehow to be stored in the
DNA of the animal,

2028
01:35:16,910 --> 01:35:18,500
which would be a smart thing to pass on
to them

2029
01:35:18,570 --> 01:35:19,381
children.
Oh,

2030
01:35:19,381 --> 01:35:20,290
would be.
Yeah,

2031
01:35:20,291 --> 01:35:21,124
yeah,
yeah.

2032
01:35:21,390 --> 01:35:26,390
Rupert sheldrake had an example about
this where he was talking about children

2033
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:31,860
in inner cities.
They're not afraid of car accidents or

2034
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:36,360
murder or a bank.
Robbers are real real threats that

2035
01:35:36,361 --> 01:35:39,300
worried about monsters even though they
don't ever see monsters.

2036
01:35:39,301 --> 01:35:43,410
They're worried about monsters in the
closet and he correlated it to an

2037
01:35:43,411 --> 01:35:48,411
ancient fear of cats like Jaguars and
leopards and lions and things that

2038
01:35:48,961 --> 01:35:53,580
killed people forever and that at night
these things with big teeth that hide in

2039
01:35:53,581 --> 01:35:58,581
the dark and we to get you the monsters,
but you know there's a video of this guy

2040
01:35:59,821 --> 01:36:04,500
where a lion or a tiger rather charges
them full clip,

2041
01:36:04,501 --> 01:36:09,000
charges them and it is as terrifying as
any harm movie you'll ever seen in your

2042
01:36:09,001 --> 01:36:12,000
life.
The thing veers off about 30 or 40 yards

2043
01:36:12,001 --> 01:36:14,010
away from him and decided not to run at
him,

2044
01:36:14,340 --> 01:36:19,010
but it's running at him.
Full clip with this insane speed that I

2045
01:36:19,020 --> 01:36:21,360
kind of knew the Tigers could run that
fast,

2046
01:36:21,660 --> 01:36:23,790
but until you see it,
you go,

2047
01:36:23,910 --> 01:36:26,340
oh my God,
they're so fast.

2048
01:36:26,410 --> 01:36:31,410
It's just this furious snarl and just
unbelievable pace as it moves towards

2049
01:36:33,841 --> 01:36:36,240
him and it's monster.
You know,

2050
01:36:36,241 --> 01:36:38,970
and if you saw that,
if that killed one of your friends and

2051
01:36:38,971 --> 01:36:42,570
you have children that would be passed
onto their kids,

2052
01:36:42,571 --> 01:36:44,520
they're like,
be scared of monsters.

2053
01:36:44,940 --> 01:36:45,860
Yeah.
Um,

2054
01:36:45,990 --> 01:36:49,320
I,
well sometimes some people take Iowasca

2055
01:36:49,321 --> 01:36:54,270
they report seeing like snakes or worms
as well.

2056
01:36:54,570 --> 01:36:55,920
Um,
jaguars too.

2057
01:36:55,980 --> 01:36:59,430
But um,
but I think that there's a physiological

2058
01:36:59,431 --> 01:37:03,540
reaction where your body's being
thinking that has been poisoned,

2059
01:37:03,541 --> 01:37:05,910
which it kind of has been in a little
bit of a way.

2060
01:37:06,300 --> 01:37:09,630
And I think that maybe in the
nonconscious there's,

2061
01:37:10,020 --> 01:37:15,020
there's this a projection of,
because I'm in your ancestral past,

2062
01:37:17,041 --> 01:37:19,860
if you're a poisoned,
it was probably because of a snake or

2063
01:37:19,861 --> 01:37:22,170
some parasite or bacteria or something
like that.

2064
01:37:22,171 --> 01:37:25,920
So maybe maybe that because that is,
like you said,

2065
01:37:25,921 --> 01:37:28,440
maybe stored in the DNA or in the memory
somehow.

2066
01:37:28,441 --> 01:37:32,880
Even if you've never ran into a snake,
perhaps you would hallucinate one.

2067
01:37:32,881 --> 01:37:36,060
If your body thinks that you're,
you've been poisoned being like what

2068
01:37:36,061 --> 01:37:40,350
happened here and kind of running
through a simulation of what must have

2069
01:37:40,351 --> 01:37:42,450
happened.
That certainly could be possible.

2070
01:37:42,451 --> 01:37:43,560
I mean,
there's a lot of variables.

2071
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:45,820
I don't think it's a,
there's Zinnia

2072
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:50,030
clear way at this time to figure out
what the hell's going on or you know,

2073
01:37:50,050 --> 01:37:52,240
like people that interpret dreams,
you know,

2074
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:54,500
oh,
well that means is you don't know what

2075
01:37:54,501 --> 01:37:55,010
the fuck.

2076
01:37:55,010 --> 01:37:55,650
Right,
right.

2077
01:37:55,650 --> 01:37:59,460
I had a dream that I was running from
Godzilla on a skateboard with my cousin

2078
01:37:59,461 --> 01:38:01,180
who I haven't seen in 20 years.
You think that's.

2079
01:38:01,470 --> 01:38:02,790
You can interpret that.
No,

2080
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:03,900
that's,
you know.

2081
01:38:03,900 --> 01:38:04,200
Oh,
well,

2082
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:06,000
you're.
You're troubled by your past.

2083
01:38:06,220 --> 01:38:10,110
You and your cousin have this tension
and the last time you saw them,

2084
01:38:10,111 --> 01:38:13,950
you,
you saw lizard and maybe or maybe the

2085
01:38:13,951 --> 01:38:15,960
human imagination.
It's just bizarre.

2086
01:38:16,010 --> 01:38:17,370
Yeah.
It's very,

2087
01:38:17,371 --> 01:38:20,400
very,
very strange and incredibly powerful.

2088
01:38:20,401 --> 01:38:24,670
I mean the idea that we can dream and I
can have a dream where,

2089
01:38:25,100 --> 01:38:29,460
where I'm making up all of these people
or people that I know in doing perfect

2090
01:38:29,461 --> 01:38:34,461
impressions of them in maybe different
languages that you don't normally know

2091
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:38,340
and you do it all without even realizing
you're doing it.

2092
01:38:38,341 --> 01:38:41,700
You think it's happening to you.
You don't even realize you're making up

2093
01:38:41,701 --> 01:38:46,690
the story line and writing the script
and putting together the actors and we

2094
01:38:46,691 --> 01:38:50,040
are doing it in your sleep,
like you wake up well rested.

2095
01:38:50,070 --> 01:38:52,410
If you sit and like read a book,
you'll get tired,

2096
01:38:53,110 --> 01:38:55,500
you'll get,
you'll get fatigued using your brain

2097
01:38:55,501 --> 01:38:57,930
like that,
but your brain can do all of that in

2098
01:38:57,931 --> 01:39:01,200
your sleep and you wake up,
well rested like it took.

2099
01:39:01,230 --> 01:39:03,360
It took no energy at all for the brain
to do that.

2100
01:39:03,510 --> 01:39:04,950
Well,
it's got to be drugs,

2101
01:39:04,951 --> 01:39:07,320
right?
I mean it's gotTa have something to do

2102
01:39:07,321 --> 01:39:09,690
with dmt.
They don't know for sure,

2103
01:39:09,691 --> 01:39:12,390
but they do believe that one year in
heavy rem sleep,

2104
01:39:12,391 --> 01:39:16,050
your brain is producing all this dmt.
Now that they know now the con would

2105
01:39:16,051 --> 01:39:19,920
research foundation has done those
studies on rats where they've proven

2106
01:39:19,921 --> 01:39:23,820
that live rats are producing
dimethyltryptamine and the pineal gland.

2107
01:39:23,850 --> 01:39:25,830
They know that this is actually the
source of it.

2108
01:39:25,890 --> 01:39:28,020
Right?
It was like the first time before it was

2109
01:39:28,021 --> 01:39:32,100
all just anecdotal evidence.
Now that they know that it's totally

2110
01:39:32,101 --> 01:39:35,850
possible that wants testing measures get
better and they can figure out how to

2111
01:39:35,851 --> 01:39:40,170
detect things at a more accurate rate,
they are eventually going to do studies

2112
01:39:40,171 --> 01:39:42,870
on people that are asleep and they're
going to be able to measure your dmt

2113
01:39:42,871 --> 01:39:46,440
levels and where it's coming from and
when it spikes and if they can somehow

2114
01:39:46,441 --> 01:39:47,340
or another,
you know,

2115
01:39:47,370 --> 01:39:52,370
they're starting to be able to do things
now where they can show you images and

2116
01:39:52,861 --> 01:39:56,250
you can receive those images in your
visual cortex.

2117
01:39:57,100 --> 01:40:00,840
Yeah.
That I have to think that eventually

2118
01:40:01,140 --> 01:40:06,140
they're going to be able to interpret
whatever kind of dreamed data is going

2119
01:40:07,381 --> 01:40:10,230
on in your head,
at least in some sort of crude form.

2120
01:40:10,231 --> 01:40:14,520
Dvr your dreams kind of eventually get
better and if we live a thousand years

2121
01:40:14,521 --> 01:40:15,360
from now,
I mean,

2122
01:40:15,361 --> 01:40:17,100
who knows what he's shown me here,
Jamie.

2123
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:18,290
I was looking something up

2124
01:40:18,300 --> 01:40:21,450
that I remember someone came in here and
talking to us about this is called

2125
01:40:21,451 --> 01:40:24,390
dreams fear.
It's an APP that people were supposed to

2126
01:40:24,391 --> 01:40:27,750
download and type in what?
Like the dreams they just had an APP is

2127
01:40:27,900 --> 01:40:29,400
getting what it's called,
like big data.

2128
01:40:29,430 --> 01:40:33,450
It's getting all the information on what
metrics people are dreaming about

2129
01:40:33,451 --> 01:40:34,270
colors.

2130
01:40:34,270 --> 01:40:36,130
Oh yeah.
And they showed you the people around

2131
01:40:36,131 --> 01:40:36,964
you who are dreaming.

2132
01:40:37,160 --> 01:40:38,900
Yeah.
And this is like 2 million people have

2133
01:40:38,901 --> 01:40:41,510
downloaded this and you can find out
what other people are dreaming about.

2134
01:40:41,530 --> 01:40:45,650
Kind of like based on a map.
And I think the person that was in here

2135
01:40:45,651 --> 01:40:47,540
that was talking about,
I said that they're finding out people

2136
01:40:47,541 --> 01:40:50,720
are dreaming about the same things at
the same time as all over the world or

2137
01:40:51,080 --> 01:40:52,520
something like that.
I don't know who said that.

2138
01:40:52,580 --> 01:40:54,070
I don't because he said

2139
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:55,650
it wasn't official data.
It was,

2140
01:40:56,530 --> 01:40:58,120
I don't,
I can't remember exactly.

2141
01:40:59,050 --> 01:41:01,480
Imagine if it's everybody dreaming about
having sexual.

2142
01:41:01,510 --> 01:41:03,670
Hillary realized like,
Whoa,

2143
01:41:03,671 --> 01:41:05,860
it's an epidemic.
And we realized she put it out there

2144
01:41:06,030 --> 01:41:08,260
from chem trails.
She spray it in the sky.

2145
01:41:08,610 --> 01:41:12,800
It's interesting that they have the um,
uh,

2146
01:41:12,980 --> 01:41:15,800
people,
people that can't talk or whatever.

2147
01:41:16,040 --> 01:41:21,040
I'm all like Stephen Hawking.
Basically you can show.

2148
01:41:21,890 --> 01:41:24,530
You can now show them.
You can give them Mris.

2149
01:41:24,620 --> 01:41:28,580
Show them pictures of,
of certain words,

2150
01:41:28,620 --> 01:41:29,960
um,
that are useful,

2151
01:41:29,961 --> 01:41:34,961
like bathroom or whatever it might be.
And then it can determine what part of

2152
01:41:35,271 --> 01:41:40,271
the brain is lighting up when they are
thinking of a bathroom and then on the

2153
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:44,780
and then you can hook them up and you
can just concentrate on the word

2154
01:41:44,781 --> 01:41:48,740
bathroom and then it will know that
they're saying bathroom.

2155
01:41:48,950 --> 01:41:50,360
And um,
and so,

2156
01:41:50,510 --> 01:41:54,710
so this is Stephen hawkings just like
hates using new technology and shit.

2157
01:41:54,711 --> 01:41:56,630
So I'm,
that's why the.

2158
01:41:56,631 --> 01:41:57,500
Yeah,
he hates it.

2159
01:41:57,610 --> 01:41:59,960
Hates Tech.
That's why his voice is still like the

2160
01:41:59,961 --> 01:42:02,960
fucking shittier than my gps.
He likes old computers.

2161
01:42:03,020 --> 01:42:05,650
Yeah.
He just doesn't like learning the new

2162
01:42:05,660 --> 01:42:08,990
technology stuff.
That's like what gets them around and

2163
01:42:08,991 --> 01:42:10,400
talks for him and everything.
He's like,

2164
01:42:10,401 --> 01:42:12,050
ah,
who needs that new shit?

2165
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:13,490
Wow.
Um,

2166
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:14,473
but,
uh,

2167
01:42:14,750 --> 01:42:17,180
but yeah,
so once we can map the brain and figure

2168
01:42:17,181 --> 01:42:19,010
out.
But I mean,

2169
01:42:19,070 --> 01:42:21,500
yeah,
that's the dream to Dvr,

2170
01:42:21,501 --> 01:42:26,501
like dreams or do a dmt trip or
something like that and then slow it

2171
01:42:26,991 --> 01:42:31,040
down because it's a dmt trip.
There's just a billion things happening

2172
01:42:31,041 --> 01:42:33,020
all at once and it's impossible to
articulate.

2173
01:42:33,050 --> 01:42:35,120
I don't think you're ever going to be
able to slow it down because I think we

2174
01:42:35,121 --> 01:42:38,750
look at it in terms of what we would see
in normal reality,

2175
01:42:38,780 --> 01:42:41,030
like if you had a scene that you could
say,

2176
01:42:41,031 --> 01:42:46,031
when you know a you were 15,
you hit a home run and a little league

2177
01:42:46,250 --> 01:42:48,520
game and you remember it so clearly
because he was the.

2178
01:42:48,530 --> 01:42:49,850
You were the hero.
You came back.

2179
01:42:49,851 --> 01:42:53,480
Everybody carried you on your shoulders.
If you could go back and replay that

2180
01:42:53,481 --> 01:42:55,430
over and over again,
if you had a recording of it in your

2181
01:42:55,431 --> 01:42:58,240
mind and you can go back and see in real
time and replay it,

2182
01:42:58,280 --> 01:43:00,650
it would all make sense.
You'd see the grass moving in the

2183
01:43:00,651 --> 01:43:03,560
breeze.
You would see the clouds floating gently

2184
01:43:03,561 --> 01:43:05,820
overhead.
You'd see the players in the field.

2185
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:08,120
You see people talking,
laughing in the stands.

2186
01:43:08,360 --> 01:43:13,360
It would all make sense because it's all
references and things that exist in this

2187
01:43:14,090 --> 01:43:17,510
dimension and this plane.
The problem with DMT is if you took even

2188
01:43:17,511 --> 01:43:21,200
one,
100th of the images that you're seeing,

2189
01:43:21,201 --> 01:43:25,640
just a little corner of it and just
looked at it and tried to examine what

2190
01:43:25,641 --> 01:43:28,730
the fuck it is.
It's constantly changing geometric

2191
01:43:28,731 --> 01:43:30,970
pattern.
It's somehow and intelligent don't like

2192
01:43:30,980 --> 01:43:34,580
to.
So to zoom in and it has some things

2193
01:43:34,581 --> 01:43:38,380
have an effect on it.
Like have you ever done dmt to a egos?

2194
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:40,820
Those,
a South American songs that they can

2195
01:43:40,821 --> 01:43:41,480
play?

2196
01:43:41,480 --> 01:43:42,620
Um,
no,

2197
01:43:42,621 --> 01:43:43,320
I,
I do.

2198
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:45,320
Um,
although I did,

2199
01:43:45,350 --> 01:43:48,390
I think he was,
the Shaman was doing them on my couple

2200
01:43:48,391 --> 01:43:52,310
of Iowasca ceremony singing,

2201
01:43:52,540 --> 01:43:56,260
but I asked her didn't really take for
me it was a bit of a disappointment or

2202
01:43:56,270 --> 01:43:58,030
did you go to a bad place?
No,

2203
01:43:58,040 --> 01:44:00,710
I just didn't have enough.
I'm strong enough.

2204
01:44:00,740 --> 01:44:03,770
Yeah.
I told them my mom and I was like,

2205
01:44:03,771 --> 01:44:05,210
I do lots of DMT.
I'm ready.

2206
01:44:05,211 --> 01:44:07,070
I just want to like,
fucking get there,

2207
01:44:07,071 --> 01:44:09,440
let's go for it.
And then it wasn't enough.

2208
01:44:09,441 --> 01:44:11,030
It was,
it was like a good mushroom trip.

2209
01:44:11,510 --> 01:44:13,040
Um,
and it was good,

2210
01:44:13,041 --> 01:44:14,040
but it wasn't.
Yeah,

2211
01:44:14,070 --> 01:44:17,030
it was enjoyable other than like sitting
in a room,

2212
01:44:17,031 --> 01:44:19,180
listen to other people,
throw up guy,

2213
01:44:19,630 --> 01:44:22,910
I just don't have the stomach for that
and it was also like,

2214
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:24,820
I don't know,
it was

2215
01:44:26,570 --> 01:44:29,510
my bullshit detector was just kind of
going off a lot.

2216
01:44:29,511 --> 01:44:34,190
There's just a lot of people dressed in
white move things.

2217
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:37,280
I was just like,
yeah,

2218
01:44:37,281 --> 01:44:39,640
there's a girl had a magic wand and I
thought

2219
01:44:41,510 --> 01:44:44,720
she was so hot to eyes like to sell hot.

2220
01:44:44,760 --> 01:44:47,480
No one's ever called your bullshit.
No,

2221
01:44:47,481 --> 01:44:47,991
no,
no.

2222
01:44:47,991 --> 01:44:49,590
The personnel would be banging it right
now.

2223
01:44:49,620 --> 01:44:53,060
Would wouldn't be on the spot.
Like a dude.

2224
01:44:53,061 --> 01:44:57,440
It never be able to fucking carrier out
a magic wand without some lady being

2225
01:44:57,441 --> 01:44:58,550
like,
what's up with that?

2226
01:44:58,580 --> 01:45:01,100
You're could Kanye West have a line of
magic ones?

2227
01:45:01,101 --> 01:45:01,831
Yeah,
yeah,

2228
01:45:01,831 --> 01:45:02,250
yeah.
He's,

2229
01:45:02,250 --> 01:45:05,390
he's easy to
pull it off.

2230
01:45:05,420 --> 01:45:08,020
Drake do it.
It was the whole.

2231
01:45:08,070 --> 01:45:10,370
I was trying to be as open minded as
possible,

2232
01:45:10,371 --> 01:45:15,371
but it was also like the Shaman going
around and like blowing smoke on the

2233
01:45:15,531 --> 01:45:17,750
crown of my head was like a bit much for
me.

2234
01:45:17,751 --> 01:45:18,351
I was like,
all right,

2235
01:45:18,351 --> 01:45:19,880
this guy's gone blown my hair now.

2236
01:45:23,410 --> 01:45:25,910
If you were super high,
you'd be connecting with.

2237
01:45:26,040 --> 01:45:27,130
I know the smoke

2238
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:31,410
and then I didn't like that you had to
like go and kneel in front of them to do

2239
01:45:31,411 --> 01:45:32,410
the thing.
I was just like,

2240
01:45:32,430 --> 01:45:33,810
so churchy.
Wait,

2241
01:45:33,900 --> 01:45:34,740
wait,
wait.

2242
01:45:35,010 --> 01:45:36,660
Yeah.
Kneel in front of him.

2243
01:45:36,690 --> 01:45:37,250
Yeah.
Yeah.

2244
01:45:37,250 --> 01:45:40,460
To like go and like sit down and from a
neil too.

2245
01:45:40,461 --> 01:45:43,560
Or is he stands up and he's sitting like
pouring the,

2246
01:45:43,890 --> 01:45:46,830
his dick was out actually come to think
of it.

2247
01:45:48,810 --> 01:45:50,130
But um,
yeah,

2248
01:45:50,131 --> 01:45:53,310
I mean if I,
if I was doing Iowasca or if I was

2249
01:45:53,311 --> 01:45:57,090
giving someone Iowasca I wouldn't be
bowing to them for being brave enough to

2250
01:45:57,091 --> 01:45:58,320
try it.
We're that.

2251
01:45:58,321 --> 01:46:01,710
He made you neil and yeah,
for me the wrong way.

2252
01:46:01,770 --> 01:46:03,390
It should.
I don't think I've heard that before,

2253
01:46:03,391 --> 01:46:07,170
but I have heard of like skeezy ceremony
guys.

2254
01:46:07,171 --> 01:46:10,800
This guy wasn't skeezy at all.
He was super cool and really bright and

2255
01:46:10,801 --> 01:46:13,050
everything.
I just thought I thought some of it was

2256
01:46:13,051 --> 01:46:14,580
a little silly.
Sorry I interrupted you.

2257
01:46:14,610 --> 01:46:15,210
No,
it's okay.

2258
01:46:15,210 --> 01:46:16,043
No,
it's,

2259
01:46:16,110 --> 01:46:18,400
there's a lot of that to these things.
It's

2260
01:46:18,710 --> 01:46:23,710
what you're experiencing is so beyond
the reality that we all know that all

2261
01:46:24,021 --> 01:46:27,000
the other silly shit almost seems okay.
Yeah.

2262
01:46:27,090 --> 01:46:29,090
Know mother,
Gaia,

2263
01:46:29,150 --> 01:46:34,150
we open ourselves to please take me down
the path of wisdom and enlightened and I

2264
01:46:34,671 --> 01:46:38,720
opened myself to you.
I come here with acknowledgement of my

2265
01:46:38,750 --> 01:46:40,400
past troubles and,
and,

2266
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:43,330
and you know,
this shit like,

2267
01:46:43,331 --> 01:46:44,690
look man,
you know what,

2268
01:46:44,750 --> 01:46:46,400
here's I actually

2269
01:46:46,640 --> 01:46:48,050
no,
they say to set an intention and

2270
01:46:48,051 --> 01:46:49,680
everything.
I set an intention.

2271
01:46:49,681 --> 01:46:54,250
I was like I want to understand why I
have some self esteem issues and why I

2272
01:46:54,300 --> 01:46:57,760
don't have more confidence and,
and I,

2273
01:46:57,850 --> 01:46:59,370
you know,
I was like I'm going to play along.

2274
01:46:59,371 --> 01:47:02,520
I'm going to be as open minded as
possible and I will say during the

2275
01:47:02,521 --> 01:47:07,470
Iowaska trip I was the most confident
I've ever felt in my entire life.

2276
01:47:07,471 --> 01:47:09,900
Like it was just a feeling like I could
do anything.

2277
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:12,000
Unfortunately.
It was all geared toward like,

2278
01:47:12,120 --> 01:47:16,050
well this is a bunch of bullshit.
Like I was pretty confident that it was.

2279
01:47:16,350 --> 01:47:18,480
I was like,
can I just go outside and like trip by

2280
01:47:18,481 --> 01:47:22,410
myself because I feel great.
I'm just in a room of people like puking

2281
01:47:22,411 --> 01:47:24,480
and farting everywhere and like I just
can't.

2282
01:47:24,750 --> 01:47:29,750
It's not for me this thing and Boeing
magic wands and um,

2283
01:47:29,910 --> 01:47:31,500
and I also,
I have,

2284
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:33,580
I have a couple things.

2285
01:47:33,580 --> 01:47:36,870
I think some people are misrepresenting
what's happening.

2286
01:47:36,900 --> 01:47:40,300
I think that I think that when you're,
um,

2287
01:47:40,380 --> 01:47:43,460
as,
as someone who's almost died like

2288
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:47,040
probably 20 times in my life,
I've had like a near death experience

2289
01:47:47,041 --> 01:47:51,570
and like breaking my feet kind of
triggered the same sort of response and

2290
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:56,040
your life flashes before your eyes and
goes kind of back in time a little bit.

2291
01:47:56,250 --> 01:47:59,400
Really that's underselling what the
brain does because it also projects all

2292
01:47:59,420 --> 01:48:02,610
these options going forward of like,
do I call an ambulance right now?

2293
01:48:02,611 --> 01:48:03,444
Do I cut it?
Yeah.

2294
01:48:03,930 --> 01:48:06,300
Am I going to be able to make it?
What's my life going to be like?

2295
01:48:06,310 --> 01:48:08,010
No.
And then,

2296
01:48:08,430 --> 01:48:11,190
um,
so I think that one,

2297
01:48:11,191 --> 01:48:13,950
when your life flashes before your eyes,
it's not like some,

2298
01:48:14,370 --> 01:48:17,160
hey,
let's just have a quick fond in this

2299
01:48:17,170 --> 01:48:20,190
stall.
Jic Run through what our life was and

2300
01:48:20,191 --> 01:48:21,360
visit some old memories.

2301
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:24,930
This is your brain going like,
do we have anything for this situation?

2302
01:48:24,931 --> 01:48:28,260
Do we have,
have we seen a TV show that will get us

2303
01:48:28,261 --> 01:48:31,440
out of this,
do we do we remember first aid class and

2304
01:48:31,441 --> 01:48:34,830
it's going back and back and back and
I'm wondering if it's going back far

2305
01:48:34,831 --> 01:48:38,580
enough to what the fetal environment was
like.

2306
01:48:38,581 --> 01:48:42,180
I wonder if we do have memories
somewhere stored in it and because the

2307
01:48:42,181 --> 01:48:46,320
fetal environment could have easily been
all of these weird structures in cities

2308
01:48:46,321 --> 01:48:48,300
and fractal like,
like it,

2309
01:48:48,530 --> 01:48:52,020
it doesn't seem that odd to me that
that's what the environment before you

2310
01:48:52,021 --> 01:48:55,480
came out of the womb could look like.
And if it's taking you back,

2311
01:48:56,060 --> 01:48:57,690
do you mean before you came out of the
womb?

2312
01:48:57,691 --> 01:49:01,290
You mean like what you were experiencing
while you're in your mother's womb?

2313
01:49:01,291 --> 01:49:04,170
Yeah.
With your eyes closed and the little

2314
01:49:04,171 --> 01:49:06,480
bits of consciousness,
do you think the first little bits of

2315
01:49:06,481 --> 01:49:07,680
conscious might be tripping?

2316
01:49:08,280 --> 01:49:09,031
Yeah.
Like,

2317
01:49:09,031 --> 01:49:11,970
uh,
like these kind of fractal structures.

2318
01:49:11,971 --> 01:49:15,000
I think fractals are,
I mean fractals,

2319
01:49:15,001 --> 01:49:19,380
you're able to put a finite it,
you're able to fit infinity into a

2320
01:49:19,381 --> 01:49:21,780
finite space somehow.
It's the weird.

2321
01:49:22,270 --> 01:49:26,100
I'm a counterintuitive thing about
fractals,

2322
01:49:26,101 --> 01:49:30,150
but if you were,
if you made packets of information that

2323
01:49:30,151 --> 01:49:33,090
were fracked alike,
that would be a great way to transport

2324
01:49:33,330 --> 01:49:36,540
information or like transport ideas I
think.

2325
01:49:36,541 --> 01:49:41,010
And so I think that could be the very
origins of consciousness and then when

2326
01:49:41,011 --> 01:49:44,430
we came out we were seeing this,
but it was all like a blob you didn't

2327
01:49:44,431 --> 01:49:47,070
see like walls or pictures or like you
didn't,

2328
01:49:47,580 --> 01:49:48,040
so it

2329
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:52,690
was just a blob of information coming at
you that you later had to be taught or

2330
01:49:52,691 --> 01:49:54,550
decipher and,
and,

2331
01:49:54,610 --> 01:49:57,480
but I think the origins of it could have
been like um,

2332
01:49:57,640 --> 01:50:00,250
these,
like I've seen a lot of holographic

2333
01:50:00,251 --> 01:50:03,790
cities and that kind of looked like
computer chips a little bit and that

2334
01:50:03,791 --> 01:50:07,210
sort of thing.
And it wouldn't surprise me if that's

2335
01:50:07,211 --> 01:50:10,600
what the first little like say you get
this machine where you can record

2336
01:50:10,601 --> 01:50:14,410
dreams.
If we can record then what's happening

2337
01:50:14,740 --> 01:50:17,590
when you're a fetus?
It wouldn't surprise me if it was

2338
01:50:17,591 --> 01:50:21,550
something like this and I think that I
think that um,

2339
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:26,760
Iowaska and DMT have a way of triggering
a near death experience,

2340
01:50:27,190 --> 01:50:29,230
whether you're consciously aware of it
or not.

2341
01:50:29,231 --> 01:50:31,000
And it's like,
what the fuck is happening right now?

2342
01:50:31,240 --> 01:50:33,080
Just like when,
you know,

2343
01:50:33,140 --> 01:50:37,870
why do you think it triggers near death
experiences or it tricks your brain into

2344
01:50:37,871 --> 01:50:39,220
thinking maybe you're dying.

2345
01:50:40,310 --> 01:50:44,040
I've never had that experience on dmt.
Never had the experience where if it

2346
01:50:44,060 --> 01:50:49,060
made me feel like maybe I was dying,
it had made me feel like maybe I went

2347
01:50:49,101 --> 01:50:51,040
somewhere where I wasn't supposed to be.
Yeah.

2348
01:50:51,110 --> 01:50:52,820
Like all my God,
you fucked up now.

2349
01:50:52,821 --> 01:50:54,950
You went to a place where you're not
even supposed to see this yet.

2350
01:50:55,310 --> 01:51:00,080
I haven't necessarily felt it that much
myself either other than I felt like I,

2351
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:02,720
you know,
I've forgotten that I'm a human that

2352
01:51:02,780 --> 01:51:04,790
smoke dmt.
I'm just like a different thing

2353
01:51:04,791 --> 01:51:05,710
entirely.
But I

2354
01:51:06,010 --> 01:51:08,120
just a little bit though,
for people that are like these fucking

2355
01:51:08,121 --> 01:51:09,290
hippies,
what are the yapping about?

2356
01:51:09,820 --> 01:51:13,520
The brain does produce endogenous
psychedelic chemicals.

2357
01:51:13,580 --> 01:51:18,380
It produces five methoxy DMT,
produces and dimethyltryptamine to super

2358
01:51:18,381 --> 01:51:21,710
potent psychedelic drugs the brain
produces and we don't understand why

2359
01:51:22,010 --> 01:51:24,980
it's entirely possible that if the adult
human brain produces it,

2360
01:51:24,981 --> 01:51:26,660
that a baby's brain producers at as
well,

2361
01:51:27,020 --> 01:51:31,730
so if it's in that womb state,
which is in a lot of ways sort of like a

2362
01:51:31,731 --> 01:51:35,360
sensory deprivation tank,
but with of course the feeling and the

2363
01:51:35,361 --> 01:51:38,670
cortisol effect of the mother and the
oxytocin and all the,

2364
01:51:39,110 --> 01:51:43,160
all the different hormones and
responding directly to the stress of the

2365
01:51:43,161 --> 01:51:45,680
mother.
There's a lot going on with the body

2366
01:51:45,830 --> 01:51:49,700
inside the body,
but we should assume that those brains

2367
01:51:49,701 --> 01:51:53,060
are experiencing what we know to be
possible in the human mind,

2368
01:51:53,090 --> 01:51:54,440
which is psychedelic chemicals.

2369
01:51:54,510 --> 01:51:58,680
And I've seen,
I've seen actual dreams on DMT trips

2370
01:51:58,740 --> 01:52:02,100
like a regular dream like you're used to
having,

2371
01:52:02,101 --> 01:52:05,340
which is unusual because that's nothing
what the normal dmt world.

2372
01:52:05,400 --> 01:52:06,360
See me look while you're talking

2373
01:52:06,490 --> 01:52:08,070
dmt or while you're dreaming.
Because I've,

2374
01:52:08,090 --> 01:52:11,070
I've had dreams where you go into the
DMT world.

2375
01:52:11,830 --> 01:52:13,820
I've experienced both.
Um,

2376
01:52:13,850 --> 01:52:18,010
but I've had,
I've smoked dmt and then I'd see like a,

2377
01:52:18,320 --> 01:52:23,320
a guy like walking down a hall holding a
box and then I'd look at them and he'd

2378
01:52:23,801 --> 01:52:26,080
look at me and be like,
oh,

2379
01:52:26,270 --> 01:52:28,800
and then start like twitching,
like,

2380
01:52:28,860 --> 01:52:31,010
like there was a glitch in the metrics
and he's like,

2381
01:52:31,050 --> 01:52:32,090
oh,
oh,

2382
01:52:32,180 --> 01:52:33,860
oh,
like making fun of me.

2383
01:52:34,410 --> 01:52:37,100
And then,
and then he just reached back and

2384
01:52:37,101 --> 01:52:41,330
grabbed the wall and pull it and it
would be like this veil that.

2385
01:52:41,331 --> 01:52:45,110
Then it became the whole world and
started like the DMT space.

2386
01:52:45,500 --> 01:52:46,333
You're more familiar.

2387
01:52:46,390 --> 01:52:49,180
Have you could sell that in a virtual
reality environment.

2388
01:52:49,181 --> 01:52:51,130
Like here's the game.
You wake up,

2389
01:52:51,131 --> 01:52:52,540
you're in a classroom,
you will,

2390
01:52:52,541 --> 01:52:53,650
you like,
you lift your head up.

2391
01:52:53,651 --> 01:52:53,891
Like,
oh,

2392
01:52:53,891 --> 01:52:56,110
I must have fallen asleep in class.
And everybody left me here.

2393
01:52:56,490 --> 01:52:58,930
You go out in the hallway and there's a
guy walking down the hallway and he's

2394
01:52:58,931 --> 01:53:00,760
carrying a box of books and you,
excuse me,

2395
01:53:00,970 --> 01:53:02,500
excuse me.
And you go up to him and he grab his

2396
01:53:02,501 --> 01:53:03,760
shoulder and he turns and looks at me
and goes,

2397
01:53:04,510 --> 01:53:06,790
oh,
that would be.

2398
01:53:07,850 --> 01:53:09,340
Yeah,
that's inevitable though.

2399
01:53:09,400 --> 01:53:12,250
They're going to be able to figure out a
way to create a virtual.

2400
01:53:12,330 --> 01:53:15,130
It's one of the acts of the things that
actually Mckenna believed that they were

2401
01:53:15,131 --> 01:53:18,640
going to be able to figure out how to
create a virtual dmt world,

2402
01:53:18,910 --> 01:53:22,570
which would give people the dmt
experience without actually taking dmt

2403
01:53:22,780 --> 01:53:25,960
is that your brain was somehow or
another synchronize with this virtual

2404
01:53:25,961 --> 01:53:29,020
world and you would have a full blown
dmt trip with.

2405
01:53:29,290 --> 01:53:31,300
And this is.
He thought this up.

2406
01:53:31,600 --> 01:53:34,010
I'm sure he was tripping,
but he thought this up,

2407
01:53:34,130 --> 01:53:36,670
like I believe the nineties or maybe
the.

2408
01:53:36,671 --> 01:53:39,790
He might might've even been the eighties
and he was talking about this is when

2409
01:53:39,820 --> 01:53:44,350
virtual reality was still like people
had predicted it's,

2410
01:53:44,770 --> 01:53:47,170
you know,
that virtual reality was going to blow

2411
01:53:47,171 --> 01:53:50,620
up and going to be huge.
But it took a long time until recently

2412
01:53:50,621 --> 01:53:52,720
where the technology caught up to the
concept.

2413
01:53:52,830 --> 01:53:53,530
Yeah.
Yeah.

2414
01:53:53,530 --> 01:53:56,050
Like they finally are starting to get
that hoverboard.

2415
01:53:57,170 --> 01:53:59,150
The Lexus one.
Is that the one you mean?

2416
01:53:59,470 --> 01:54:00,290
The one with the

2417
01:54:00,290 --> 01:54:03,070
error?
The same guy that made the pack,

2418
01:54:03,071 --> 01:54:06,520
that goes in water and then shoots the
air he made.

2419
01:54:06,730 --> 01:54:11,730
He made a board that you stand on that
uses fans and he hovers like 30,

2420
01:54:13,550 --> 01:54:16,570
40 feet above the ground.
Have you seen that video?

2421
01:54:16,600 --> 01:54:17,750
No.
Yeah,

2422
01:54:17,760 --> 01:54:18,480
yeah.

2423
01:54:18,480 --> 01:54:23,340
Talking about the Orioles Hoverboard,
which uses magnets somehow it's got like

2424
01:54:23,341 --> 01:54:27,240
some super cooled magnets with liquid
nitrogen or something like that I

2425
01:54:27,241 --> 01:54:30,480
believe.
And the Lexus one is really cool because

2426
01:54:31,280 --> 01:54:35,340
it's sort of a proof of concept.
And what they're doing right now is

2427
01:54:35,341 --> 01:54:38,980
they're using it and the guy stands on
it like a skateboard and he,

2428
01:54:39,060 --> 01:54:42,660
he sort of slides around on things and
it's only a couple inches off the

2429
01:54:42,661 --> 01:54:44,460
ground,
but it's clearly floating like you're

2430
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:46,590
here now.
This is another one.

2431
01:54:46,620 --> 01:54:49,080
This is the other one.
This is another one called Arco Board.

2432
01:54:49,350 --> 01:54:50,820
Oh,
so this one's all fans.

2433
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:53,850
This isn't the one that I was,
it might not be real.

2434
01:54:53,851 --> 01:54:56,430
This looks fake as fuck.
This looks like a sitcom actor.

2435
01:54:56,790 --> 01:54:59,340
Um,
well it was that real.

2436
01:54:59,590 --> 01:55:01,880
So,
um,

2437
01:55:03,370 --> 01:55:06,550
I could run fast and that I'm not
impressed on find the lexis one.

2438
01:55:06,580 --> 01:55:07,870
Whoa,
that is pretty dope though.

2439
01:55:08,790 --> 01:55:09,660
So is this real?

2440
01:55:11,320 --> 01:55:13,700
I don't believe that guy.
Oh Wow.

2441
01:55:13,720 --> 01:55:15,380
A bunch of fans.
Okay.

2442
01:55:16,090 --> 01:55:19,780
So if you.
If you just put flyboard air test one,

2443
01:55:19,990 --> 01:55:22,190
try to go to the lexus thing first.
I want to.

2444
01:55:22,270 --> 01:55:24,430
I want to show you this lexus thinks,
and I haven't seen this,

2445
01:55:25,210 --> 01:55:28,030
this is Alexis ones on magnets and
stuff.

2446
01:55:28,060 --> 01:55:30,640
Yeah,
it's super cooled magnets with some sort

2447
01:55:30,641 --> 01:55:32,380
of liquid nitrogen.
Look at that.

2448
01:55:32,381 --> 01:55:34,900
See how it's so all that air that's
coming out of the bottom.

2449
01:55:35,140 --> 01:55:39,430
That's the liquid nitrogen.
So I think lexus is assuming that this

2450
01:55:39,431 --> 01:55:44,310
technology sort of like back to the
futures shit that this technology

2451
01:55:44,310 --> 01:55:46,500
is eventually.
How are we going to get around with cars

2452
01:55:47,010 --> 01:55:48,720
and one of the interesting things about
that,

2453
01:55:48,721 --> 01:55:50,670
if they really do figure out how to do
this,

2454
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:55,350
if we get around in cars that are not
connected to the ground with wheels,

2455
01:55:55,410 --> 01:55:58,680
even though there will be momentum as we
collide with each other,

2456
01:55:58,681 --> 01:56:00,930
if we fuck up,
it won't have nearly the same kind of

2457
01:56:00,931 --> 01:56:04,680
impact because you won't have the
friction of the row that makes the

2458
01:56:04,681 --> 01:56:07,230
vehicle absorb the energy of the other
vehicle.

2459
01:56:07,820 --> 01:56:09,990
It'll absorb it a little bit and then
bounce you back.

2460
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:11,160
Yeah.
No.

2461
01:56:11,160 --> 01:56:14,840
Well with having.
Eventually our power lines will be super

2462
01:56:14,841 --> 01:56:18,150
conductors to.
So they're cooled down enough so you're

2463
01:56:18,151 --> 01:56:21,930
not losing all that.
You're losing something like a quarter

2464
01:56:21,931 --> 01:56:25,230
of the energy is just lost in the wires
and transit.

2465
01:56:25,370 --> 01:56:26,203
Right.
Um,

2466
01:56:26,850 --> 01:56:29,400
so I had to find the flyboard.

2467
01:56:29,410 --> 01:56:32,160
Yeah,
I'm flyboard air test.

2468
01:56:32,161 --> 01:56:34,860
Holy Shit.
This guy's flying.

2469
01:56:35,070 --> 01:56:35,701
Yeah.
Okay.

2470
01:56:35,701 --> 01:56:37,710
This is way cooler than that other piece
of shit

2471
01:56:39,290 --> 01:56:41,400
quit.
This is nuts.

2472
01:56:41,430 --> 01:56:44,850
How long can this guy stay on this thing
for like five or 10 minutes or something

2473
01:56:44,851 --> 01:56:48,510
like that in Wa.
Watch him stick this landing to it's,

2474
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:51,160
it's incredible how much control he has
over it.

2475
01:56:51,300 --> 01:56:52,770
This is amazing.
Now,

2476
01:56:52,771 --> 01:56:54,540
is this available for public
consumption?

2477
01:56:54,600 --> 01:56:56,100
Um,
I think this is.

2478
01:56:56,450 --> 01:56:59,010
I think it will be a representative of
this company.

2479
01:56:59,680 --> 01:57:03,690
Employee.
I hope to be at will happily represent

2480
01:57:03,720 --> 01:57:05,760
the hover board company.
I want to.

2481
01:57:05,761 --> 01:57:09,060
I want to be associated with them.
Look at the crazy wind is coming from it

2482
01:57:09,061 --> 01:57:11,940
and that other frame you could see like
when there's a dark background,

2483
01:57:11,941 --> 01:57:14,910
you could see the force of the air below
it back up a little bit.

2484
01:57:14,911 --> 01:57:16,710
Jamie.
She could see the force of the air below

2485
01:57:16,711 --> 01:57:17,544
that thing.

2486
01:57:18,450 --> 01:57:19,440
See if you can.
Yeah,

2487
01:57:19,441 --> 01:57:21,570
look at that.
See that force like backup a little bit

2488
01:57:21,571 --> 01:57:23,730
so he could see it like,
look as he's flying,

2489
01:57:24,030 --> 01:57:26,850
how much air that thing must be pumping.
Look at that.

2490
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:31,000
That's crazy.
And it's fucking up the water underneath

2491
01:57:31,001 --> 01:57:33,180
him as he's swimming around or is flying
around.

2492
01:57:33,200 --> 01:57:35,430
Whether that's incredible,
man.

2493
01:57:35,550 --> 01:57:37,920
Oh yeah.
I've watched the landing here.

2494
01:57:38,700 --> 01:57:43,110
Look at how accurate this is.
Wow.

2495
01:57:43,510 --> 01:57:46,950
That's like a five by five space that he
just landed dead center.

2496
01:57:47,160 --> 01:57:49,680
And he landed right next to two guys
that were so confident.

2497
01:57:49,681 --> 01:57:54,120
They just stood there while he's flying
around on what it looks like.

2498
01:57:54,190 --> 01:57:56,280
It's like a,
like a box.

2499
01:57:56,450 --> 01:57:58,410
Yeah.
It doesn't even look like a skateboard.

2500
01:57:58,411 --> 01:58:01,620
It looks like a circular,
like a small trampoline.

2501
01:58:01,680 --> 01:58:03,410
It's so small.
You know,

2502
01:58:04,020 --> 01:58:06,780
I'm fucking amazing.
Mission one coming soon.

2503
01:58:06,840 --> 01:58:08,510
Flyboard.
Um,

2504
01:58:08,730 --> 01:58:10,110
what is the data on this video?

2505
01:58:10,110 --> 01:58:12,750
Jamie is like a year ago,
maybe

2506
01:58:14,430 --> 01:58:15,840
April of this year.
Oh,

2507
01:58:16,260 --> 01:58:18,720
it's just a matter of time before
someone has one of those in.

2508
01:58:18,721 --> 01:58:19,860
They're flying right in front of your
window,

2509
01:58:19,861 --> 01:58:22,980
jerking off on your house.
One hundred percent going to happen,

2510
01:58:23,820 --> 01:58:25,560
right?
Someone's going to be the first guy.

2511
01:58:25,590 --> 01:58:27,620
They're like,
they're shooting down drones.

2512
01:58:27,630 --> 01:58:30,870
Someone's going to shoot one of those
that's going to go to Britney Spears

2513
01:58:30,870 --> 01:58:33,120
House and walk off on her roof and
they're going to get arrested.

2514
01:58:33,480 --> 01:58:37,170
And it'll be like the new thing,
like planking was a thing for awhile.

2515
01:58:38,340 --> 01:58:42,220
Jerking off Hubbard.
Eric's famous people's be a new thing.

2516
01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:44,830
Yeah.
We're going to not be able to control

2517
01:58:44,831 --> 01:58:46,420
the skies.
It's sorta like the ocean.

2518
01:58:46,490 --> 01:58:50,200
I think the ocean is fascinating for
friends who have friends that have

2519
01:58:50,560 --> 01:58:51,460
boats,
you know,

2520
01:58:51,461 --> 01:58:55,060
the guys liked to go fishing and I've
never had a boat,

2521
01:58:55,240 --> 01:58:57,530
but one of the things that I've always
thought was incredible.

2522
01:58:57,531 --> 01:59:00,820
It was like if you live like Siri,
Marina del Rey or something like that

2523
01:59:00,821 --> 01:59:02,830
and you have a boat and you hop out and
your boat,

2524
01:59:02,860 --> 01:59:04,960
you go out into another world,
you're,

2525
01:59:05,290 --> 01:59:09,370
you're a fucking space traveler on a
boat and you're roaming around this

2526
01:59:09,371 --> 01:59:14,371
enormous swath of ocean and you're free
to go left and right and up and down,

2527
01:59:15,100 --> 01:59:17,410
and there's no roads and there's no
restrictions.

2528
01:59:17,620 --> 01:59:18,453
You can do whatever you want.

2529
01:59:18,640 --> 01:59:20,690
So I,
I can't believe like people are so I,

2530
01:59:20,691 --> 01:59:23,230
I mean I think space travel is exciting
and everything,

2531
01:59:23,231 --> 01:59:26,050
but everyone's like,
what if we found aliens?

2532
01:59:26,051 --> 01:59:29,980
There's like there's aliens,
they're in the ocean and it's cheap to

2533
01:59:29,981 --> 01:59:32,800
get to them.
Just go to every time we go down deeper,

2534
01:59:32,860 --> 01:59:36,670
we've discovered all these new worlds
down there and they're constantly

2535
01:59:36,720 --> 01:59:40,110
finding crazy new life forms.
I wonder if like what would the number

2536
01:59:40,111 --> 01:59:43,740
or the percentage of documented life
forms in the ocean are because they're

2537
01:59:43,741 --> 01:59:48,540
always finding new freaky variations.
Did you ever see that m squared that

2538
01:59:48,541 --> 01:59:51,020
they found that has crab legs?
No.

2539
01:59:51,270 --> 01:59:52,550
Yeah,
it's crazy man.

2540
01:59:52,551 --> 01:59:56,190
It's a giant squid that they found in
Mexico and it was a camera that was

2541
01:59:56,191 --> 02:00:01,191
attached to one of those oil rigs,
so they were essentially just checking

2542
02:00:01,741 --> 02:00:04,620
the oil rig and there was this thing
that was floating right next to the

2543
02:00:04,700 --> 02:00:09,700
which is really freaky looking alien
squid that has like crab legs,

2544
02:00:12,240 --> 02:00:15,480
like really bizarre,
like obvious bends to the legs.

2545
02:00:15,481 --> 02:00:16,230
Like,
check this out,

2546
02:00:16,230 --> 02:00:18,840
look at this,
look at that fucking thing man.

2547
02:00:19,940 --> 02:00:24,000
Like look how long it's tentacles are.
It's enormous.

2548
02:00:24,001 --> 02:00:27,000
This is 2007.
Was the name of this video?

2549
02:00:27,001 --> 02:00:27,960
Jamie,
so people could

2550
02:00:29,980 --> 02:00:34,120
alien like squid filmed in oil drilling
site is this one I picked,

2551
02:00:34,121 --> 02:00:38,620
but that's exactly what I would call it.
Video courtesy of the Shell oil company

2552
02:00:38,650 --> 02:00:41,710
Shell doing a good job at finding aliens
in the ocean.

2553
02:00:42,070 --> 02:00:44,140
There's like that blue planet or
something.

2554
02:00:44,160 --> 02:00:46,720
One of those BBC documentaries like
planet earth,

2555
02:00:46,721 --> 02:00:50,850
but just ocean stuff and you watch it
and it's like you could show people and

2556
02:00:50,851 --> 02:00:55,570
they and they would think that you're
watching like Cgi made up thing like

2557
02:00:55,571 --> 02:00:57,610
about aliens.
Like have you ever seen anything like

2558
02:00:57,611 --> 02:00:59,180
this before?
Um,

2559
02:00:59,210 --> 02:01:00,970
that back it up.
So you can see that,

2560
02:01:00,971 --> 02:01:03,430
that image again with articulating bent
arms,

2561
02:01:03,431 --> 02:01:05,230
like,
what the fuck is that man?

2562
02:01:05,530 --> 02:01:06,790
Just look at that.
If you,

2563
02:01:07,030 --> 02:01:09,820
if you saw that thing floating in space,
right?

2564
02:01:09,821 --> 02:01:11,980
If they were already.
Well,

2565
02:01:12,040 --> 02:01:14,770
if they were on their way to the moon
and they saw that thing floating in

2566
02:01:14,771 --> 02:01:15,320
space,

2567
02:01:15,320 --> 02:01:16,220
go,
whoa.

2568
02:01:17,250 --> 02:01:20,180
Exactly.
There's an alien in space that's

2569
02:01:20,181 --> 02:01:22,490
watching over the planet.
Found that too.

2570
02:01:22,491 --> 02:01:24,950
They're very intelligent.
They can solve puzzles.

2571
02:01:25,460 --> 02:01:27,080
We would,
we would think that is the most

2572
02:01:27,081 --> 02:01:29,510
incredible discovery ever.
But we see this thing in the ocean like,

2573
02:01:29,540 --> 02:01:30,470
oh,
it's just here.

2574
02:01:30,660 --> 02:01:34,100
Yeah.
It depends on where you put things,

2575
02:01:34,101 --> 02:01:36,410
right.
Like if you put anything is more

2576
02:01:36,411 --> 02:01:39,080
interesting as you put it in space.
There was an orange,

2577
02:01:39,290 --> 02:01:41,450
we found an orange on the moon.
Oh my God.

2578
02:01:41,530 --> 02:01:44,740
And there's like that.
Like I was talking about how your brain

2579
02:01:44,770 --> 02:01:48,880
perceives things as metaphors,
everything that's like getting high is

2580
02:01:48,881 --> 02:01:53,710
good or you're feeling like up or rather
than down as bad,

2581
02:01:53,711 --> 02:01:56,890
you know,
and held under the Earth and heavens up

2582
02:01:56,891 --> 02:01:58,630
in the clouds and stuff.
There's something,

2583
02:01:58,870 --> 02:02:03,760
I don't know if it's just this natural
like are inherent fight against gravity

2584
02:02:04,090 --> 02:02:09,090
that makes us think like that's what you
want to pain to lift off to be up there.

2585
02:02:10,290 --> 02:02:13,270
You know?
Hell is definitely because of volcanoes.

2586
02:02:13,650 --> 02:02:15,520
I mean,
it only makes sense.

2587
02:02:15,580 --> 02:02:16,413
Well,
yeah,

2588
02:02:16,760 --> 02:02:17,340
it makes sense.

2589
02:02:17,340 --> 02:02:18,990
I mean,
have you ever been near a volcano

2590
02:02:18,991 --> 02:02:20,040
before?
Um,

2591
02:02:20,041 --> 02:02:22,560
no.
The Big island has awesome tours.

2592
02:02:22,590 --> 02:02:25,860
You could hop in a helicopter,
you fly over the big island of Hawaii

2593
02:02:26,070 --> 02:02:30,240
and you could actually watch the island
grow because the island grows something

2594
02:02:30,241 --> 02:02:31,740
like a foot a day or something like
that.

2595
02:02:31,920 --> 02:02:35,040
Like you can literally see the lava come
out of the,

2596
02:02:35,190 --> 02:02:39,000
out of the chutes and go into the ocean
and create new land.

2597
02:02:39,160 --> 02:02:41,490
And that's awesome.
Fucking awesome.

2598
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:45,000
And you're flying over this helicopter,
the helicopter rather.

2599
02:02:45,060 --> 02:02:49,320
You're flying over this volcano and you
look down into lava,

2600
02:02:49,530 --> 02:02:54,530
you see the very center of the earth
oozing out of it's out of this weird

2601
02:02:54,991 --> 02:02:57,870
surface which has created the entire
Hawaiian island chain by the way,

2602
02:02:57,930 --> 02:03:00,480
the entire Hawaiian island chain.
It's just volcanoes.

2603
02:03:00,690 --> 02:03:02,880
That's all it is.
Volcanoes in the middle of the ocean

2604
02:03:03,120 --> 02:03:06,900
that erupted millions of years ago and
poke their way through the top and

2605
02:03:06,901 --> 02:03:08,730
there's constantly growing and changing

2606
02:03:09,610 --> 02:03:14,050
reality is far more interesting than
what humans were able to make up in

2607
02:03:14,051 --> 02:03:16,600
their wildest fantasies of trying to
explain it.

2608
02:03:16,620 --> 02:03:17,850
What was happening?
Well,

2609
02:03:17,851 --> 02:03:21,570
once we get a grip on reality or we get
a good account of reality,

2610
02:03:21,571 --> 02:03:23,880
then you can get pretty creative with
your imagination.

2611
02:03:24,170 --> 02:03:25,080
But the.
Yeah,

2612
02:03:25,081 --> 02:03:30,000
the this,
the actual reality of space is insane.

2613
02:03:30,180 --> 02:03:34,470
The idea that there's hundreds of
billions of galaxies out there and that

2614
02:03:34,500 --> 02:03:38,790
each one of them has an infinite
possibilities about what kind of planets

2615
02:03:38,791 --> 02:03:40,980
around there,
how far they are from their stars.

2616
02:03:41,190 --> 02:03:45,330
How many stars are in the solar system,
what else is out there in terms of life?

2617
02:03:45,630 --> 02:03:48,330
What are the possibilities of things
surviving out there?

2618
02:03:48,331 --> 02:03:51,780
They think it's possible that some
living things could maybe even survive

2619
02:03:51,781 --> 02:03:53,940
in space,
detached from a planet,

2620
02:03:54,270 --> 02:03:55,240
right?
Yeah.

2621
02:03:55,280 --> 02:03:57,330
I mean,
even the reality of evolution,

2622
02:03:57,331 --> 02:03:58,164
like,
right?

2623
02:03:59,040 --> 02:04:01,830
I mean when you,
when you get far enough into it and you

2624
02:04:01,831 --> 02:04:05,790
look at all these different examples,
it's the reality of evolution is

2625
02:04:06,060 --> 02:04:10,080
actually crazier than like there was a
god and he had a son named Jesus.

2626
02:04:10,280 --> 02:04:12,990
It is,
it's also more accurate.

2627
02:04:13,260 --> 02:04:15,140
Um,
but I,

2628
02:04:15,270 --> 02:04:18,780
I remember I used to be like,
how could anyone believe it?

2629
02:04:18,890 --> 02:04:21,810
I was very angry.
I raised a strictly Catholic,

2630
02:04:21,811 --> 02:04:24,000
so I had some bitterness about all of
that.

2631
02:04:24,420 --> 02:04:27,090
And um,
but then once I started learning more

2632
02:04:27,091 --> 02:04:29,850
about evolution and it's just like,
oh,

2633
02:04:29,851 --> 02:04:32,340
this is,
I didn't know half of this stuff.

2634
02:04:32,610 --> 02:04:34,810
It's no wonder these people,
you know,

2635
02:04:35,460 --> 02:04:37,530
no one's been given the opportunity,
learn it,

2636
02:04:37,680 --> 02:04:39,660
you know,
and when you're brought up in a small

2637
02:04:39,661 --> 02:04:41,910
town and that's just your upbringing,
never.

2638
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:43,990
Yeah,
I mean,

2639
02:04:44,590 --> 02:04:47,560
man,
just stop and think about the big bang.

2640
02:04:48,310 --> 02:04:49,870
If you want a mind,
fuck yourself.

2641
02:04:50,200 --> 02:04:53,260
Think about the idea that these
scientists are proposing that the

2642
02:04:53,261 --> 02:04:55,330
universe itself,
everything that you say,

2643
02:04:55,331 --> 02:04:59,080
it was smaller than the head of a pin
and had infinite mass and somehow or

2644
02:04:59,081 --> 02:05:01,690
another exploded and created everything.
We've seen the stars today.

2645
02:05:03,270 --> 02:05:07,720
What are you sure
that's under debate?

2646
02:05:07,780 --> 02:05:08,980
I mean,
there's other proposals.

2647
02:05:09,010 --> 02:05:11,210
There's other scientific,
uh,

2648
02:05:11,230 --> 02:05:14,140
ideas that have been bandied about,
parallel universes,

2649
02:05:14,350 --> 02:05:16,540
brains,
membranes colliding,

2650
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:17,330
you know,
the,

2651
02:05:17,330 --> 02:05:20,470
there's different universities in
dimensions or like just slightly

2652
02:05:20,471 --> 02:05:25,360
separated from each other and they
collide the endless process of expansion

2653
02:05:25,361 --> 02:05:28,810
and contraction and that that's what
happens at the entire universe.

2654
02:05:28,811 --> 02:05:33,190
Expands infinitely and then pulls back
into an infinitely small spot and then

2655
02:05:33,191 --> 02:05:33,611
like,
you know,

2656
02:05:33,611 --> 02:05:36,910
every x amount of billion years just
repeats the cycle.

2657
02:05:37,250 --> 02:05:37,851
Yeah.
No,

2658
02:05:37,851 --> 02:05:39,080
I mean,
I think that our,

2659
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:43,130
I think that our brains are endlessly
fascinating to just that.

2660
02:05:43,190 --> 02:05:45,890
I mean humans like to give themselves a
lot of credit,

2661
02:05:46,310 --> 02:05:50,180
but I think that we have like,
like kind of like the movie inside out.

2662
02:05:50,181 --> 02:05:55,181
I think we have vast universes inside of
our head that seem all expensive.

2663
02:05:55,281 --> 02:05:56,370
And uh,
because I,

2664
02:05:56,490 --> 02:06:01,490
I think that dreams and hallucinating
are coming from within sight,

2665
02:06:02,720 --> 02:06:05,000
from inside the mind.
I don't believe that you're connecting

2666
02:06:05,001 --> 02:06:06,800
with different dimensions and stuff like
that,

2667
02:06:06,801 --> 02:06:09,080
but it certainly looks like it,
which means you have,

2668
02:06:09,230 --> 02:06:10,820
if I'm right,
a which,

2669
02:06:10,821 --> 02:06:13,820
who knows,
then it means that you have this whole

2670
02:06:13,821 --> 02:06:18,080
like multiverse set up just for running
all these different tests just for like

2671
02:06:18,170 --> 02:06:23,030
walking around and making decisions.
There's entire universes inside of your

2672
02:06:23,031 --> 02:06:24,230
head,
which

2673
02:06:24,230 --> 02:06:26,150
is totally possible,
but I don't,

2674
02:06:26,151 --> 02:06:28,400
I don't have a position.
I don't have a position on whether or

2675
02:06:28,401 --> 02:06:30,560
not it's in my mind or whether or not
it's real.

2676
02:06:31,130 --> 02:06:33,800
And I think it's entirely possible that
we need,

2677
02:06:33,860 --> 02:06:38,000
need to consider the possibility that
everything that's in your mind,

2678
02:06:38,001 --> 02:06:40,550
everything that's imaginary is actually
real.

2679
02:06:40,790 --> 02:06:44,750
Meaning that the imagination is
responsible for every single thing any

2680
02:06:44,770 --> 02:06:47,030
human has ever done.
Every car that's ever been built,

2681
02:06:47,031 --> 02:06:50,600
every podcasts ever been made.
Every television has ever been designed.

2682
02:06:50,810 --> 02:06:52,730
All of that has come out of the
imagination.

2683
02:06:52,980 --> 02:06:57,290
The imagination is as strange force
inside of human,

2684
02:06:57,291 --> 02:07:00,260
you know,
quote unquote consciousness that living,

2685
02:07:00,261 --> 02:07:04,640
physical or not living but solid
physical things come from like

2686
02:07:04,641 --> 02:07:07,040
literally.
It's the seed of these solid physical

2687
02:07:07,041 --> 02:07:09,050
things.
So when we say that,

2688
02:07:09,430 --> 02:07:13,040
you know,
were imagining or hallucinating that

2689
02:07:13,041 --> 02:07:17,800
we're experiencing some divine entity to
comes to us from another dimension and

2690
02:07:17,801 --> 02:07:19,970
explains the universe,
the nature of reality.

2691
02:07:20,510 --> 02:07:24,020
It's entirely possible that that is a
hallucination.

2692
02:07:24,021 --> 02:07:26,240
Meaning that physical thing,
you can't kidnap it.

2693
02:07:26,241 --> 02:07:30,230
You can't throw a net on it and bring it
back from you know the wormhole and Plop

2694
02:07:30,231 --> 02:07:31,730
it down in front of the police
department.

2695
02:07:31,731 --> 02:07:32,181
Say,
look,

2696
02:07:32,181 --> 02:07:35,830
I found it a proof of another dimension.
I brought something right?

2697
02:07:35,960 --> 02:07:36,160
But

2698
02:07:36,160 --> 02:07:39,060
if you went to visit with God,
say if,

2699
02:07:39,061 --> 02:07:39,894
if,
if,

2700
02:07:39,940 --> 02:07:44,200
if someone proves that there is a heaven
and that God is real and you can have a

2701
02:07:44,201 --> 02:07:47,340
brief visit with God and you go to God
and you,

2702
02:07:47,341 --> 02:07:50,890
you talked to him and in 15 minutes
explains the nature of the universe and

2703
02:07:50,891 --> 02:07:53,680
love and the concept of positive energy
and all these different things.

2704
02:07:53,950 --> 02:07:56,800
Please take this back with you.
Please take this back with you and do

2705
02:07:56,801 --> 02:07:58,270
what you can to make the world a better
place.

2706
02:07:58,990 --> 02:08:02,440
Well,
if you have a trip or if you actually go

2707
02:08:02,441 --> 02:08:06,670
to meet God and or if you have a trip
where you imagine you meet God,

2708
02:08:06,671 --> 02:08:09,020
the experience is exactly the same.
Like we,

2709
02:08:09,160 --> 02:08:12,280
I don't think we know what's real and
what's not real.

2710
02:08:12,281 --> 02:08:14,980
I think we're super cocky and were real
nervous.

2711
02:08:14,981 --> 02:08:17,950
Like one of the reasons why we get
paranoid when we smoked pot is because

2712
02:08:18,010 --> 02:08:21,640
we start becoming aware of variables
that we might have suppressed or chosen

2713
02:08:21,641 --> 02:08:24,730
to ignore and then they,
we're confronted with them and all of

2714
02:08:24,731 --> 02:08:28,480
our insecurities and like a cascade tied
away sort of a situation where you can

2715
02:08:28,481 --> 02:08:30,700
handle all the data that you've been
putting aside like,

2716
02:08:30,701 --> 02:08:31,534
oh fuck

2717
02:08:31,570 --> 02:08:33,370
yeah,
I smoke weed and I'm like,

2718
02:08:33,460 --> 02:08:35,410
oh my fucking to do list.

2719
02:08:35,590 --> 02:08:37,600
I think about bills that didn't pay when
I was 18.

2720
02:08:38,050 --> 02:08:39,970
Like what do I do?
I'm going to do you.

2721
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:45,000
There's weird things that happened to
the mind and I don't know how much of

2722
02:08:45,880 --> 02:08:49,780
what we call the imagination,
how we try to think of it as like,

2723
02:08:49,810 --> 02:08:51,340
oh,
it's just imagining things,

2724
02:08:51,820 --> 02:08:52,780
man.
I don't know.

2725
02:08:52,870 --> 02:08:53,703
I don't,
I don't.

2726
02:08:53,750 --> 02:08:56,710
I,
I think it's entirely possible that were

2727
02:08:56,711 --> 02:09:01,120
really hung up on this word real.
Like what's real and what's not real.

2728
02:09:01,121 --> 02:09:03,870
I think we're real hung up on that.
Real real.

2729
02:09:04,010 --> 02:09:06,580
Our Day to day lives is dependent on
imagination.

2730
02:09:06,600 --> 02:09:09,860
We've all imagined democracy are these
laws came.

2731
02:09:09,890 --> 02:09:14,450
We're a human invention that came from
imagination that we imagine is real.

2732
02:09:14,480 --> 02:09:17,360
Even even every corporation isn't an
actual thing.

2733
02:09:17,361 --> 02:09:20,390
It's an idea that we just imagined and
we take it for granted.

2734
02:09:20,391 --> 02:09:25,391
You don't have to go like,
you don't have to go like do I believe

2735
02:09:26,211 --> 02:09:30,350
in seven slash 11 or like you take it
for granted that seven slash 11 is just

2736
02:09:30,351 --> 02:09:32,270
an idea.
It's a,

2737
02:09:32,330 --> 02:09:33,620
it's,
it's a,

2738
02:09:33,980 --> 02:09:38,390
a judge could close down seven slash 11
with one of his ideas at any moment and

2739
02:09:38,391 --> 02:09:41,390
then it would no longer exist,
but the buildings are still there,

2740
02:09:41,990 --> 02:09:44,300
but you know,
7:11 is not the building.

2741
02:09:44,540 --> 02:09:46,610
It's not the employees,
it's,

2742
02:09:46,970 --> 02:09:50,990
it's just an idea,
an idea implemented in the physical form

2743
02:09:50,991 --> 02:09:52,220
that you can experience,
right?

2744
02:09:52,280 --> 02:09:52,650
You can go ahead

2745
02:09:52,650 --> 02:09:53,850
touch it,
you can walk in the door,

2746
02:09:53,851 --> 02:09:58,140
you could smell it,
but I just don't know if that makes it

2747
02:09:58,141 --> 02:10:01,680
real and then everything that happens to
you in your dream is not real.

2748
02:10:01,980 --> 02:10:03,300
I don't know.
I don't know.

2749
02:10:03,320 --> 02:10:06,030
I don't know what,
what really is in terms of like,

2750
02:10:06,031 --> 02:10:07,470
well,
if you want to be successful in this

2751
02:10:07,471 --> 02:10:09,420
world,
if you want to be successful in this

2752
02:10:09,421 --> 02:10:11,610
material world,
you have to consider the fact that laws

2753
02:10:11,611 --> 02:10:13,650
are real.
You can't drive a thousand miles an hour

2754
02:10:13,651 --> 02:10:16,230
in a 20 mile zone.
You can't punch babies.

2755
02:10:16,350 --> 02:10:20,160
There's a lot of real consequences for
real actions because this world has

2756
02:10:20,161 --> 02:10:21,020
rules.
Right?

2757
02:10:21,021 --> 02:10:25,080
Right.
But it doesn't mean that the trips that

2758
02:10:25,081 --> 02:10:28,650
you have,
these intense transcendent psychedelic

2759
02:10:28,651 --> 02:10:32,010
experiences are hallucinations.
It doesn't mean that they're not real.

2760
02:10:32,430 --> 02:10:36,860
It means we be entirely hung up on
containing our consciousness and our

2761
02:10:36,861 --> 02:10:41,861
thinking and our awareness to what we
can touch and bang on and pick up and

2762
02:10:42,801 --> 02:10:43,810
measure and the look.

2763
02:10:43,820 --> 02:10:48,080
I put it on a scale.
I know it's real and these physical laws

2764
02:10:48,081 --> 02:10:51,140
that we've applied to this reality,
what we call reality,

2765
02:10:51,620 --> 02:10:56,240
don't necessarily know if that.
I think it's entirely possible to me

2766
02:10:56,390 --> 02:11:00,800
that that might be a limiting factor on
how we perceive the universe around us

2767
02:11:00,980 --> 02:11:05,210
and that it's leftover from having to
worry about predators and hunting and

2768
02:11:05,211 --> 02:11:07,010
gathering.
And we're moving,

2769
02:11:07,100 --> 02:11:09,960
I believe slowly away from that.
No,

2770
02:11:10,140 --> 02:11:15,140
not even slowly and I think our ability
to alter reality through virtual reality

2771
02:11:16,100 --> 02:11:20,300
and even through our understanding and
application of psychedelic drugs,

2772
02:11:20,480 --> 02:11:25,480
there's like a psychedelic technology as
well as virtual technology and all of

2773
02:11:26,031 --> 02:11:31,031
these things are giving us this,
this ability to change the concept of

2774
02:11:31,101 --> 02:11:31,920
real,

2775
02:11:31,920 --> 02:11:35,070
like the realm of possibilities as we
can imagine that.

2776
02:11:36,120 --> 02:11:38,760
Because even to say that punching babies
is a bad thing,

2777
02:11:38,780 --> 02:11:39,470
I mean,
who,

2778
02:11:39,470 --> 02:11:44,470
who I'm fucking single guy and your baby
punch,

2779
02:11:44,810 --> 02:11:47,310
I um,
but here,

2780
02:11:47,320 --> 02:11:50,760
here's where I'm,
I try to be very,

2781
02:11:50,761 --> 02:11:55,761
very skeptical of my trips because I've
seen God in different universes and like

2782
02:11:56,041 --> 02:11:59,130
the whole bit and it seems like as real,
as anything I've ever experienced did

2783
02:11:59,880 --> 02:12:02,940
my,
my problem with my memory and perception

2784
02:12:02,941 --> 02:12:05,940
of it is,
is that it's just such a short amount of

2785
02:12:05,941 --> 02:12:09,420
time and it's so different and so
exciting that I think the brain,

2786
02:12:09,840 --> 02:12:12,360
I think that the brain just
automatically,

2787
02:12:12,361 --> 02:12:14,550
I think that's very salient in the
brain,

2788
02:12:14,551 --> 02:12:18,630
really attaches to this,
these new and novel new information

2789
02:12:18,631 --> 02:12:21,960
that's very exciting and it's a little
scary to your brain.

2790
02:12:21,961 --> 02:12:25,710
Remembers his scary things a lot.
Tricker is a bit of a stress response.

2791
02:12:26,250 --> 02:12:29,340
And I think that I,
I like to say that imagine instead there

2792
02:12:29,341 --> 02:12:31,570
was someone who was,
who was born on,

2793
02:12:31,880 --> 02:12:33,480
on a,
uh,

2794
02:12:33,620 --> 02:12:35,970
it was like they just have the brain
chemistry,

2795
02:12:35,971 --> 02:12:40,971
like the brains on Lsd all the time.
And then one day things are rainbow

2796
02:12:41,011 --> 02:12:41,701
colored,
whatever.

2797
02:12:41,701 --> 02:12:44,340
And that's fine,
and then one day when I get around just

2798
02:12:44,341 --> 02:12:47,190
fine and then one day when they're 30,
someone gives them a pill that brings

2799
02:12:47,191 --> 02:12:51,660
them to our reality.
It would seem just as mind blowing and

2800
02:12:51,661 --> 02:12:56,280
just as true like I get it now there's
these things called jobs and like these

2801
02:12:56,281 --> 02:13:00,090
entry level positions and like these
hierarchies and you can,

2802
02:13:00,200 --> 02:13:05,040
if you show up on time each day you can
establish yourself in this hierarchy,

2803
02:13:05,041 --> 02:13:05,970
you know,
and then you,

2804
02:13:06,690 --> 02:13:09,510
if you went in on different days,
it would seem like a different world.

2805
02:13:09,511 --> 02:13:12,900
Like I thought I had it all figured out,
but then I was like this person that was

2806
02:13:12,901 --> 02:13:16,170
in a cube typing away.
And then you think you have that figured

2807
02:13:16,171 --> 02:13:18,810
out and then you hit a casual Friday and
you're like,

2808
02:13:18,811 --> 02:13:20,940
it was weird.
I thought they all had uniforms and then

2809
02:13:20,941 --> 02:13:22,650
they all looked different.
You know,

2810
02:13:22,680 --> 02:13:24,870
like this is this.
To me,

2811
02:13:24,900 --> 02:13:29,900
this perception is just as much the trip
as any psychedelic will will ever get

2812
02:13:30,541 --> 02:13:31,351
you on.
It's that,

2813
02:13:31,351 --> 02:13:32,040
that's such a

2814
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:33,440
short amount of time.
In reality,

2815
02:13:33,450 --> 02:13:36,090
it's very bizarre and we're.
We're accustomed to it.

2816
02:13:36,150 --> 02:13:37,930
Yeah.
We're just used to this.

2817
02:13:39,020 --> 02:13:44,020
It's entirely possible that your reality
is different than his reality,

2818
02:13:45,390 --> 02:13:47,280
than my reality.
Then another person's reality.

2819
02:13:47,281 --> 02:13:50,820
Then what you were talking about before
being how the way you view the world and

2820
02:13:50,821 --> 02:13:54,040
how the world seems to you is more
fucked up when you're hurt you,

2821
02:13:54,100 --> 02:13:55,410
when you were,
when you were injured.

2822
02:13:55,500 --> 02:13:59,100
Yup.
It might entirely be possible that when

2823
02:13:59,101 --> 02:14:01,920
you make good decisions,
when you decide to take care of your

2824
02:14:01,921 --> 02:14:03,450
body,
when you started to eat healthy,

2825
02:14:03,451 --> 02:14:08,451
when you side to meditate or do yoga or
practice mindfulness or set out an

2826
02:14:08,941 --> 02:14:12,600
intention for your day and say,
you know today I'm not going to complain

2827
02:14:12,601 --> 02:14:13,470
about anything.
You know,

2828
02:14:13,471 --> 02:14:15,150
I'm going to show up on time.
I'm not going to complain.

2829
02:14:15,151 --> 02:14:17,100
I'm being nice person and I'm going to
try to.

2830
02:14:17,730 --> 02:14:19,470
When I went to a negative thought comes
into my main,

2831
02:14:19,620 --> 02:14:21,490
my brain,
it's going to be a mandate.

2832
02:14:21,491 --> 02:14:24,360
I'm going to do my best to push that out
and replace it with a positive thought.

2833
02:14:24,810 --> 02:14:29,810
When someone chooses to exercise like
that sort of a protocol chooses to go

2834
02:14:32,401 --> 02:14:35,240
forth with like a like a list of things
that they're going to,

2835
02:14:35,460 --> 02:14:37,830
this is how I'm going to treat life as
I'm going to think about life and I'm

2836
02:14:37,831 --> 02:14:40,160
going to be fluid while I'm doing it,
but I'm not gonna.

2837
02:14:40,180 --> 02:14:43,830
Allow all these things that I know to be
detrimental aspects of life.

2838
02:14:43,920 --> 02:14:45,750
I'm not gonna.
Allow those in if I can help it.

2839
02:14:46,320 --> 02:14:48,180
Just doing that changes the world.
Right?

2840
02:14:48,240 --> 02:14:52,130
I mean she literally changes your world
and I think it's.

2841
02:14:52,260 --> 02:14:55,590
It's entirely possible that what you're
talking about when you're saying that

2842
02:14:55,620 --> 02:14:58,410
when you're enthusiastic and you're
embracing the psychedelic experience,

2843
02:14:58,411 --> 02:15:01,890
that it's possible that your brain
creates all this new stuff,

2844
02:15:01,891 --> 02:15:03,450
but that might be the point.

2845
02:15:03,900 --> 02:15:07,830
That might be the point of all of it.
When you have these psychedelic trips

2846
02:15:07,831 --> 02:15:12,360
and your brain on the psychedelic trips
interacts with those songs and the

2847
02:15:12,361 --> 02:15:13,700
music,
the ECO rose,

2848
02:15:13,701 --> 02:15:15,420
what?
I know you didn't have like the best

2849
02:15:15,421 --> 02:15:19,200
experience of it because you're the DMT,
which wasn't as strong in the IOWASCA,

2850
02:15:19,620 --> 02:15:24,620
but I've had experiences with the songs
where you see the experience moving to

2851
02:15:25,291 --> 02:15:25,921
the song,
well,

2852
02:15:25,921 --> 02:15:30,390
if a song can alter the way,
and I know there's something special

2853
02:15:30,391 --> 02:15:34,530
about sounds and music,
there's some special connection between

2854
02:15:34,800 --> 02:15:39,800
creative and creative sounds that people
have put together and concocted and put

2855
02:15:40,321 --> 02:15:42,360
together in some sort of a a beautiful
song.

2856
02:15:42,540 --> 02:15:45,000
There's A.
There's a response that the body has to

2857
02:15:45,001 --> 02:15:47,250
those like you know,
like if you're on a treadmill and a

2858
02:15:47,251 --> 02:15:49,350
great song comes on,
you feel like he could run faster.

2859
02:15:50,340 --> 02:15:53,750
Music contains some sort of inspiration.

2860
02:15:54,450 --> 02:15:54,841
Well,
there's A.

2861
02:15:54,841 --> 02:15:55,860
There's an effect,
right?

2862
02:15:56,130 --> 02:15:59,370
But that effect also has an effect on
the psychedelic world when you're

2863
02:15:59,371 --> 02:16:01,360
tripping.
Those songs have an effect.

2864
02:16:01,500 --> 02:16:04,860
Yeah.
My thought is that your mind and your

2865
02:16:04,861 --> 02:16:09,861
attitude might not just have an effect
on experiences when you're running into

2866
02:16:10,561 --> 02:16:12,630
people.
It might have an effect on the

2867
02:16:12,631 --> 02:16:16,200
psychedelic dreams might have an effect
on your future and it might not just be

2868
02:16:16,201 --> 02:16:19,560
hippy bullshit.
The thinking positive and choosing to

2869
02:16:19,561 --> 02:16:23,490
act and go forth in a positive way is
just a,

2870
02:16:24,120 --> 02:16:29,120
just like a good Karma Sorta Hippie,
nonsensical way of trying control

2871
02:16:30,130 --> 02:16:32,890
the uncontrollable,
which is this random world we live in

2872
02:16:33,230 --> 02:16:36,910
might not be true.
We just might think that because it's

2873
02:16:36,911 --> 02:16:40,630
comforting.
It might want to think that there's less

2874
02:16:40,631 --> 02:16:42,220
control than there actually is.

2875
02:16:43,150 --> 02:16:45,080
Um,
I think that.

2876
02:16:45,760 --> 02:16:47,000
Oh,
that's a lot.

2877
02:16:47,240 --> 02:16:48,510
Um,
I,

2878
02:16:48,710 --> 02:16:52,430
so one way in the way in which,
um,

2879
02:16:52,730 --> 02:16:55,340
so I,
I sometimes at home I'll have a,

2880
02:16:55,580 --> 02:16:58,620
I'll have like an animal planet,
like planet earth or whatever on,

2881
02:16:58,700 --> 02:17:03,700
on mute and then I'll be playing music
and I'll have people over and people

2882
02:17:04,311 --> 02:17:06,860
think that it's because I'm playing the
music through the TV.

2883
02:17:06,861 --> 02:17:09,050
People think that they're like,
what is this program?

2884
02:17:09,051 --> 02:17:09,950
What's this?
I'm like,

2885
02:17:09,951 --> 02:17:12,920
oh,
it's just that it's just on mute with

2886
02:17:12,921 --> 02:17:16,580
music playing over it.
But if I don't tell people that they'll

2887
02:17:16,590 --> 02:17:20,300
be watching it and if it's like a happy
go lucky song,

2888
02:17:20,630 --> 02:17:21,830
they're like,
oh man,

2889
02:17:21,831 --> 02:17:23,000
these animals.
Sure.

2890
02:17:23,001 --> 02:17:23,781
Got It.
Good.

2891
02:17:23,781 --> 02:17:27,590
Don't they look at how.
Look at how relaxing that looks just

2892
02:17:27,591 --> 02:17:30,530
laid out in the sun.
And then if it's like a real intense

2893
02:17:30,531 --> 02:17:31,460
dark song,
they're like,

2894
02:17:31,490 --> 02:17:33,860
oh my God,
are they ever going to make it?

2895
02:17:33,861 --> 02:17:36,080
Like,
it completely changes their perception

2896
02:17:36,081 --> 02:17:38,210
of it.
This is why we have soundtracks and

2897
02:17:38,211 --> 02:17:40,270
everything else.
And um,

2898
02:17:40,370 --> 02:17:44,690
I actually,
I actually think that music altering the

2899
02:17:44,720 --> 02:17:49,720
psychedelic state or world or perception
or whatever you want to say,

2900
02:17:49,850 --> 02:17:53,780
um,
is like I listen to this band spawn goal

2901
02:17:53,790 --> 02:17:55,790
that makes music specifically for an
emt.

2902
02:17:56,240 --> 02:17:57,060
I think that that's

2903
02:17:57,060 --> 02:18:02,060
is one of my rants really spangle song
that has this long rant where me and Jim

2904
02:18:03,090 --> 02:18:03,810
Breuer,
we're,

2905
02:18:03,810 --> 02:18:08,810
we're so barbecued on a pot lollipops
and this was like the early two

2906
02:18:10,231 --> 02:18:14,060
thousands,
some guy called in and um,

2907
02:18:14,370 --> 02:18:14,970
he,
uh,

2908
02:18:14,970 --> 02:18:17,730
asked us a question about something
about dmt.

2909
02:18:17,731 --> 02:18:22,731
And I went on this crazy rant about dmt
state and they put it into a song.

2910
02:18:23,590 --> 02:18:24,540
But that's,
uh,

2911
02:18:24,940 --> 02:18:27,060
I,
I wouldn't want to hear that while I'm

2912
02:18:27,061 --> 02:18:28,890
tripping.
I don't like when there's words in their

2913
02:18:28,891 --> 02:18:31,500
songs.
I try to only listen to music one's way

2914
02:18:31,501 --> 02:18:32,334
to aggro

2915
02:18:33,200 --> 02:18:36,140
Tuesday astic.
But I was just hanging out with my

2916
02:18:36,141 --> 02:18:39,650
friend and we were just so high.
We're barely should be talking to

2917
02:18:39,651 --> 02:18:41,330
people,
definitely not answering phone calls.

2918
02:18:41,650 --> 02:18:46,540
See to me that the fact that a different
song and I'll see like a different story

2919
02:18:46,541 --> 02:18:49,690
and it's pretty predictable.
Like I'll play the song again and I know

2920
02:18:49,691 --> 02:18:51,970
I'm going to see like this purple woman
dancing around or whatever.

2921
02:18:52,420 --> 02:18:56,470
Um,
and the fact that that influences that

2922
02:18:56,980 --> 02:19:00,640
perception,
that world that you're in is more of an

2923
02:19:00,641 --> 02:19:05,641
indicator to me that it's coming from
within your head and not like

2924
02:19:07,510 --> 02:19:10,480
transporting you to a different
dimension or making you perceive a

2925
02:19:10,481 --> 02:19:13,720
different dimension because why?
Why would it influence that dimension?

2926
02:19:13,721 --> 02:19:16,330
A better example,
I smoked dmt wants that.

2927
02:19:16,331 --> 02:19:17,760
I had my,
uh,

2928
02:19:17,770 --> 02:19:22,770
my dog jumped on my lap while I was on a
dmt trip and then it came into my dmt

2929
02:19:24,431 --> 02:19:27,230
trip,
like all colorful and in codes and

2930
02:19:27,231 --> 02:19:29,270
stuff.
And then I saw like,

2931
02:19:29,650 --> 02:19:34,400
like kind of a bit of a dream state of,
of where I would.

2932
02:19:34,790 --> 02:19:39,290
I saw myself setting my dog down.
But I was like sitting in a different

2933
02:19:39,291 --> 02:19:41,510
spot.
I was at the kitchen table and it's

2934
02:19:41,511 --> 02:19:45,470
where my dog would normally jump on my
lap and where I'd normally be like no,

2935
02:19:45,471 --> 02:19:48,440
and sit down.
And so it was like accessing that part

2936
02:19:48,441 --> 02:19:52,280
of the brain that has the memory,
like this is when we put the dog down

2937
02:19:52,520 --> 02:19:54,890
and then I,
I lifted it off of me and I think

2938
02:19:54,891 --> 02:19:57,680
there's all these.
I see lots of things like that,

2939
02:19:57,681 --> 02:19:58,910
like these,
uh,

2940
02:19:59,420 --> 02:20:04,420
like these exemplars,
like these kind of prototype objects

2941
02:20:05,930 --> 02:20:08,600
that your brain is using to retrieve.
Like if you,

2942
02:20:08,870 --> 02:20:12,890
if you're gonna throw a Frisbee,
I think that you're accessing like this,

2943
02:20:13,400 --> 02:20:17,750
this ideal frisbee throw in your mind.
You could probably close your eyes and

2944
02:20:17,751 --> 02:20:19,550
picture it right now.
And,

2945
02:20:19,700 --> 02:20:23,240
and I think that that's in there like
these prototypes that we,

2946
02:20:23,360 --> 02:20:27,290
that our brain draws off of because I've
seen that on a dmt trip,

2947
02:20:27,320 --> 02:20:31,760
like a silhouette of like a perfect
frisbee throw and then the guy's like

2948
02:20:32,620 --> 02:20:35,090
100 times doing like the same movement
or whatever.

2949
02:20:35,600 --> 02:20:40,600
And just things like that make me think
that it's just some neural process and

2950
02:20:42,490 --> 02:20:47,490
how the brain,
how the brain interprets reality at

2951
02:20:47,811 --> 02:20:50,300
different levels.
You might be right or

2952
02:20:50,680 --> 02:20:53,350
they might not be mutually exclusive,
they might intertwine.

2953
02:20:53,710 --> 02:20:56,920
It's entirely possible that everything
is connected and that when you are

2954
02:20:56,921 --> 02:21:00,220
imagining things in the DMT realm,
you're imagining things in another

2955
02:21:00,221 --> 02:21:03,940
dimension and they're happening in that
dimension because your imagination can

2956
02:21:03,941 --> 02:21:08,941
create things in that bizarre,
detached from your body world that you

2957
02:21:09,971 --> 02:21:12,040
experienced under intense psychedelic
states.

2958
02:21:12,041 --> 02:21:14,260
It might not be mutually exclusive,
it might not be,

2959
02:21:14,261 --> 02:21:15,940
oh,
this is all my imagination.

2960
02:21:16,540 --> 02:21:18,300
That might be true.
You like,

2961
02:21:18,310 --> 02:21:22,240
you might be creating this,
but that also might be real in that

2962
02:21:22,241 --> 02:21:25,330
dimension,
in that state as far as real goals,

2963
02:21:25,570 --> 02:21:27,670
you know,
this 15 minute lifetime.

2964
02:21:28,020 --> 02:21:30,640
And that's what you have.
You have a 15 minute dmt lifetime.

2965
02:21:30,641 --> 02:21:31,620
You're there for 15 minutes.

2966
02:21:31,910 --> 02:21:34,130
I have a most at the time,
you got to go deeper.

2967
02:21:34,131 --> 02:21:39,131
So I
usually use a,

2968
02:21:39,171 --> 02:21:41,810
um,
a vape pen and vape pen.

2969
02:21:41,870 --> 02:21:43,310
Yeah,
I have a,

2970
02:21:43,740 --> 02:21:45,680
um,
why do you use one of those?

2971
02:21:46,190 --> 02:21:49,060
Because it's a lot smoother.
And um,

2972
02:21:49,190 --> 02:21:52,670
and you can just draw bigger hits and
it's fast.

2973
02:21:52,840 --> 02:21:55,400
Do you use like a,
it's like an oil vaporizer.

2974
02:21:55,401 --> 02:22:00,401
It has like a little cup in it and you
put the dmt in this little cup and.

2975
02:22:01,100 --> 02:22:02,840
Okay.
So you're not talking about like a,

2976
02:22:02,870 --> 02:22:06,080
like a blue cigarette pen talking about
like a fat one,

2977
02:22:06,081 --> 02:22:07,730
like,
like you would use for your vaping?

2978
02:22:08,060 --> 02:22:08,840
Yeah.
Yeah.

2979
02:22:08,840 --> 02:22:10,130
Okay.
So there's not really a pen,

2980
02:22:10,131 --> 02:22:12,230
right?
Like a more of a vape pipe?

2981
02:22:12,450 --> 02:22:13,750
Um,
yeah,

2982
02:22:13,770 --> 02:22:15,660
just that thing.
It's uh,

2983
02:22:16,590 --> 02:22:18,980
it's pretty um,
put in,

2984
02:22:19,020 --> 02:22:21,770
put it in cheap pen and you're doing
like a g pen.

2985
02:22:21,890 --> 02:22:22,520
I know what it is.

2986
02:22:22,520 --> 02:22:23,130
Yeah.
Yeah.

2987
02:22:23,130 --> 02:22:25,100
So one of those,
um,

2988
02:22:25,920 --> 02:22:28,080
I've,
I've tried so many different methods of

2989
02:22:28,081 --> 02:22:30,990
smoking and that's just I think the most
potent way.

2990
02:22:31,590 --> 02:22:36,590
And so I had an intense one about a week
or two ago and I had um,

2991
02:22:38,190 --> 02:22:41,160
I had about six big reps,
but I was already in there.

2992
02:22:41,640 --> 02:22:45,390
And then I had two more big ones.
It was a,

2993
02:22:45,391 --> 02:22:48,390
it was a bit much.
It's going to be a little while before I

2994
02:22:48,391 --> 02:22:50,180
can go back in there.
Yeah,

2995
02:22:50,181 --> 02:22:54,060
I'm going to have to process for awhile.
I went for years after one or I do want

2996
02:22:54,061 --> 02:22:54,650
to go back.
Yeah,

2997
02:22:54,650 --> 02:22:55,320
yeah.
I wonder.

2998
02:22:55,320 --> 02:22:56,340
I went months recently.

2999
02:22:57,180 --> 02:23:00,390
It was so.
It was so heavy that I.

3000
02:23:00,390 --> 02:23:01,330
Reality was a,
I,

3001
02:23:01,340 --> 02:23:03,030
I,
the way I describe it as very slippery

3002
02:23:03,031 --> 02:23:05,760
for like two weeks or everything seemed
fake.

3003
02:23:06,050 --> 02:23:09,120
Like every car driving cars.
I was constantly worried about cars

3004
02:23:09,121 --> 02:23:11,780
flying over from other lanes and
smashing into my windshield,

3005
02:23:11,781 --> 02:23:16,781
like all this weird paranoid thoughts.
Whereas when I logically and objectively

3006
02:23:18,090 --> 02:23:23,090
feel feel like it's possible that it was
the ego trying to regain control by like

3007
02:23:25,260 --> 02:23:30,260
activating distress and like physical
worry sort of intentions,

3008
02:23:31,260 --> 02:23:35,640
like worry about strangers,
worried about random crime or accidents

3009
02:23:35,641 --> 02:23:36,720
and things along those lines.
You know,

3010
02:23:36,721 --> 02:23:38,160
that it was like my brain was like,
hey,

3011
02:23:38,161 --> 02:23:39,630
the world's a hard fucking place.
You know?

3012
02:23:39,631 --> 02:23:43,590
It's like the conservative right wing
aspect of the mind sort of kicks in

3013
02:23:43,860 --> 02:23:44,590
tenfold.

3014
02:23:44,590 --> 02:23:45,560
Yeah,
yeah.

3015
02:23:45,561 --> 02:23:47,000
I,
I've experienced that.

3016
02:23:47,090 --> 02:23:47,923
I've been,
I've,

3017
02:23:48,170 --> 02:23:51,050
I've experienced where I'm walking down
the street and then I have to be like,

3018
02:23:51,110 --> 02:23:52,910
wait,
is this real?

3019
02:23:52,970 --> 02:23:55,670
Or was that real?
Because it seemed really real,

3020
02:23:55,700 --> 02:23:59,000
but here's my.
My take on it is that DMT is,

3021
02:23:59,090 --> 02:24:02,720
is to perfect,
like everything's too perfect in there

3022
02:24:02,721 --> 02:24:06,680
and symmetrical like it take,
it would take say this where this world

3023
02:24:06,681 --> 02:24:10,340
that we know is a simulation,
it would take far more computational

3024
02:24:10,341 --> 02:24:14,840
power to put all these little flaws in
to put like a spill on the coffee table

3025
02:24:14,841 --> 02:24:18,470
or whatever.
It was a 11 billion years since the big

3026
02:24:18,471 --> 02:24:23,471
bang and 4 billion years of evolution
all to get this fucking little spill on

3027
02:24:23,721 --> 02:24:27,290
a coffee table.
Whereas DMT is like these.

3028
02:24:27,890 --> 02:24:31,250
You can,
you can make good dmt representations

3029
02:24:31,251 --> 02:24:35,180
just using some fractal programs and
Alex gray paintings.

3030
02:24:35,300 --> 02:24:38,630
Yeah,
and that's with like we're doing this

3031
02:24:38,631 --> 02:24:41,930
with computers that we built in where
monkeys,

3032
02:24:42,400 --> 02:24:42,760
right.

3033
02:24:42,760 --> 02:24:44,500
Again,
isn't it just what we're used to.

3034
02:24:44,650 --> 02:24:47,410
We're used to this imperfect world,
so we think the imperfect world is

3035
02:24:47,411 --> 02:24:48,310
normal.
You know,

3036
02:24:48,311 --> 02:24:51,550
maybe this is the oddity.
Maybe the oddity of coffee spills is

3037
02:24:51,551 --> 02:24:54,730
what's really strange and that dmt
represents,

3038
02:24:54,731 --> 02:24:57,340
is the energy that creates the world
itself.

3039
02:24:57,370 --> 02:25:01,750
Unharnessed sort of unbridled,
not an unattached to culture,

3040
02:25:01,751 --> 02:25:03,340
language,
physical bodies.

3041
02:25:03,900 --> 02:25:06,790
Any anything that we come to accept as
being a normal thing,

3042
02:25:07,180 --> 02:25:11,080
I think there's a perfect world
simulated within our mind that we're

3043
02:25:11,081 --> 02:25:11,914
trying to act

3044
02:25:12,040 --> 02:25:14,880
hold on bae,
but why make that distinction is the

3045
02:25:15,010 --> 02:25:17,470
question and not that there's anything
wrong with what you're doing versus what

3046
02:25:17,471 --> 02:25:21,040
I'm doing,
but why make a choice that it's in your

3047
02:25:21,041 --> 02:25:24,790
mind versus where a lot of people like
to say,

3048
02:25:24,791 --> 02:25:25,630
who the fuck knows?

3049
02:25:25,710 --> 02:25:26,460
Yeah,
yeah.

3050
02:25:26,460 --> 02:25:28,560
No,
I say who the fuck knows as well.

3051
02:25:28,890 --> 02:25:31,620
I'm just trying to be objective,
scientific,

3052
02:25:31,621 --> 02:25:32,790
objective,
scientific,

3053
02:25:32,791 --> 02:25:35,190
skeptical of my own perceptions because
when I'm in there,

3054
02:25:35,940 --> 02:25:36,990
I'll come out.
I'll be like,

3055
02:25:37,080 --> 02:25:38,490
I just saw God,
no doubt about it.

3056
02:25:39,250 --> 02:25:41,380
Do you feel like,
and this is one of the reasons why I'm

3057
02:25:41,381 --> 02:25:43,420
getting to this line of questioning,
is actually a point to it.

3058
02:25:43,510 --> 02:25:45,520
Do you feel like.
Because I know that you do a lot of

3059
02:25:45,521 --> 02:25:48,430
stuff with science and your part of your
presentation,

3060
02:25:48,431 --> 02:25:52,480
your comedy show involve science and
when you're under the scrutiny,

3061
02:25:52,540 --> 02:25:55,720
and this is a very good thing of,
of other scientists and other people

3062
02:25:55,721 --> 02:25:58,640
that are going to judge what you're
saying and making sure that you're,

3063
02:25:58,670 --> 02:25:59,081
you know,
you're,

3064
02:25:59,081 --> 02:26:02,560
you're correct about your facts.
Do you find that you tend to be more

3065
02:26:02,561 --> 02:26:07,561
skeptical or tend to lean towards
outcomes razor more acceptable answers,

3066
02:26:10,180 --> 02:26:15,070
more scientifically plausible or at
least a more scientifically acceptable

3067
02:26:15,071 --> 02:26:16,960
in like academic circles?

3068
02:26:17,060 --> 02:26:18,350
Absolutely.
Um,

3069
02:26:18,351 --> 02:26:21,890
I think that one,
my brain just likes working that way

3070
02:26:21,891 --> 02:26:23,540
anyway.
Um,

3071
02:26:23,710 --> 02:26:28,100
I was always like a big fan of math and
a very good at it and I kind of liked

3072
02:26:28,190 --> 02:26:31,220
numbers because you could make sense of
the world.

3073
02:26:31,221 --> 02:26:32,260
And,
and um,

3074
02:26:32,870 --> 02:26:36,200
and I would say that I,
I was actually scared to the psychedelic

3075
02:26:36,201 --> 02:26:39,170
show that I do now.
I was planning on doing it like five

3076
02:26:39,171 --> 02:26:40,490
years from now or so.
It was just,

3077
02:26:40,491 --> 02:26:42,680
I've been sitting on it for like a
couple of years really.

3078
02:26:42,980 --> 02:26:44,750
And um,
I was like,

3079
02:26:44,751 --> 02:26:47,060
well,
once I'm like a bigger name or

3080
02:26:47,061 --> 02:26:49,040
something,
then maybe I'll have the power to go out

3081
02:26:49,041 --> 02:26:52,850
and do this because I have my podcast,
I interviewed scientists each week and I

3082
02:26:52,851 --> 02:26:54,260
need to reach out to these people.
I'm like,

3083
02:26:54,290 --> 02:26:55,910
oh,
I don't want them thinking I'm like some

3084
02:26:55,911 --> 02:26:58,640
burnout or some lunatic or something
like that.

3085
02:26:58,940 --> 02:27:01,370
So absolutely that.
Absolutely,

3086
02:27:01,640 --> 02:27:03,590
um,
factors in,

3087
02:27:03,591 --> 02:27:08,591
in my perception of things as does.
I mean also,

3088
02:27:08,660 --> 02:27:11,000
none of,
none of my memories of any of this stuff

3089
02:27:11,001 --> 02:27:13,790
are reliable.
You don't be interesting with your,

3090
02:27:14,210 --> 02:27:16,640
uh,
with the idea you're talking about

3091
02:27:16,641 --> 02:27:18,650
before,
if you scan someone's brain and then you

3092
02:27:18,651 --> 02:27:21,320
saw,
you watched the replay of them hitting a

3093
02:27:21,321 --> 02:27:25,250
home run or something.
Well that memory wouldn't necessarily be

3094
02:27:25,251 --> 02:27:26,300
accurate.
In fact,

3095
02:27:26,301 --> 02:27:27,920
there's a good chance that it wouldn't
be.

3096
02:27:27,950 --> 02:27:29,210
Yeah.
And so you could,

3097
02:27:29,300 --> 02:27:34,300
you could see different people's,
how people's memory looks as opposed to

3098
02:27:35,570 --> 02:27:40,130
what was actually captured on,
on CC TV or whatever it might be,

3099
02:27:40,160 --> 02:27:41,030
you know,
as a,

3100
02:27:41,031 --> 02:27:41,500
your exam.

3101
02:27:41,500 --> 02:27:42,610
Well,
the hot and cold thing,

3102
02:27:42,611 --> 02:27:45,580
but how all the different factors that
sort of are involved.

3103
02:27:45,581 --> 02:27:47,170
And how you feel about things.

3104
02:27:47,330 --> 02:27:48,220
Yeah.
And,

3105
02:27:48,340 --> 02:27:51,710
and just everyone also were very ego
driven.

3106
02:27:51,711 --> 02:27:56,600
We tend to think that we tend to think
that we're smarter and more attractive

3107
02:27:56,601 --> 02:28:00,020
and more skilled driver or whatever.
All the above,

3108
02:28:01,170 --> 02:28:02,270
you know,
that uh,

3109
02:28:02,330 --> 02:28:05,840
do you know the study where they took
the faces and they morph to them.

3110
02:28:05,870 --> 02:28:10,160
I'm like 10 degrees,
five times in each way to make them more

3111
02:28:10,161 --> 02:28:12,950
or less attractive.
So you take your face and then you make

3112
02:28:12,951 --> 02:28:15,830
it 10 percent more symmetrical,
20 percent more symmetrical,

3113
02:28:15,860 --> 02:28:19,640
so on to like 50 percent and then you
make it less symmetrical.

3114
02:28:19,641 --> 02:28:23,060
And so you get a job,
a real faced by that and not in the ugly

3115
02:28:23,061 --> 02:28:25,520
one.
And then you mix up all of those faces

3116
02:28:25,910 --> 02:28:29,080
and you have a.
and you flash,

3117
02:28:29,360 --> 02:28:32,180
um,
all of the pictures I'll all mixed up to

3118
02:28:32,181 --> 02:28:34,760
a person and give them a second to pick
it or whatever.

3119
02:28:34,761 --> 02:28:39,020
And people,
pr people predictively a,

3120
02:28:39,680 --> 02:28:43,310
we'll pick the one that's 10 to 20
percent more attractive.

3121
02:28:43,580 --> 02:28:46,520
So it's,
you think of yourself as like 10 to 20

3122
02:28:46,521 --> 02:28:49,640
percent,
like around 50 percent smarter,

3123
02:28:49,641 --> 02:28:50,900
more attractive,
more skilled.

3124
02:28:50,901 --> 02:28:53,780
At driving whatever it might be,
because that gives you the confidence

3125
02:28:53,781 --> 02:28:56,960
which is often beneficial in life,
but it's not,

3126
02:28:57,170 --> 02:29:01,730
you're not thinking 30 percent more
because now you're delusional if some

3127
02:29:01,731 --> 02:29:03,590
people do though some.
Oh yeah,

3128
02:29:03,591 --> 02:29:06,680
there's tip that scale and,
and there's people with low self esteem

3129
02:29:06,681 --> 02:29:07,670
that don't,
you know,

3130
02:29:08,120 --> 02:29:08,953
there's a lot of factors.

3131
02:29:08,960 --> 02:29:09,793
Various.
Yeah,

3132
02:29:09,840 --> 02:29:13,320
there are.
And also one person's perception of you

3133
02:29:13,380 --> 02:29:17,190
like objective perception might be very
different like you and I might observe

3134
02:29:17,191 --> 02:29:20,320
someone and you might come away with a
take like,

3135
02:29:20,340 --> 02:29:21,930
oh this guy is this and that.
And I'd be like,

3136
02:29:21,960 --> 02:29:23,610
hmm,
I thought he was this or that.

3137
02:29:23,730 --> 02:29:25,560
And then we would discuss it and then I
figured out,

3138
02:29:25,561 --> 02:29:29,010
well he reminded you of this asshole
used to know and he reminded me and my

3139
02:29:29,011 --> 02:29:31,500
best friend from high school and just
weird

3140
02:29:33,300 --> 02:29:34,350
things.
And again,

3141
02:29:34,380 --> 02:29:37,500
things we bring into how we approach
anything.

3142
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,830
Your brain to save.
I mean you can't,

3143
02:29:41,190 --> 02:29:45,480
you just can't sit and analyze every
little aspect every.

3144
02:29:45,660 --> 02:29:50,010
I could sit in this table and like
really see every single little grain of

3145
02:29:50,011 --> 02:29:52,710
it if I wanted to,
but at some point the brain has to be

3146
02:29:52,711 --> 02:29:53,431
like,
who cares?

3147
02:29:53,431 --> 02:29:55,410
That's not valuable information.

3148
02:29:55,410 --> 02:29:57,780
Yeah,
you have to eat unless you're going to

3149
02:29:57,790 --> 02:29:59,880
sleep too.
A lot of conclusions.

3150
02:29:59,881 --> 02:30:01,800
We stereotype.
We simplify,

3151
02:30:01,830 --> 02:30:05,130
overly simplify everything and that's
one of the reasons why we chastise

3152
02:30:05,131 --> 02:30:09,120
people for racism because we know how
easily the inclination to judge people

3153
02:30:09,121 --> 02:30:14,121
specifically on what they look like and
how unfair it is and how reminding

3154
02:30:14,251 --> 02:30:16,350
ourselves over and over again and that's
not cool.

3155
02:30:16,490 --> 02:30:20,160
It gives the whole culture more of a
relaxed feeling.

3156
02:30:20,520 --> 02:30:23,460
You know?
Humans are so strange,

3157
02:30:23,461 --> 02:30:24,240
man.
We're so.

3158
02:30:24,240 --> 02:30:26,310
It's so cool to be a person.
You know?

3159
02:30:26,311 --> 02:30:28,590
It's so.
It's so bizarre when you think about all

3160
02:30:28,591 --> 02:30:32,640
the variables and the possibilities of
human behavior and how different

3161
02:30:32,641 --> 02:30:35,970
cultures except certain things,
and we look different and we live in

3162
02:30:35,971 --> 02:30:40,560
different climates and we're such an odd
fucking creature that's just completely

3163
02:30:40,561 --> 02:30:41,850
overwhelming.
This globe.

3164
02:30:42,020 --> 02:30:45,350
Yeah.
It's existence is a bizarre thing that I

3165
02:30:45,360 --> 02:30:47,780
just,
I can't get my head around existence.

3166
02:30:47,781 --> 02:30:49,790
I always,
I never really liked it that much.

3167
02:30:49,850 --> 02:30:51,090
But existence.
Yeah.

3168
02:30:51,770 --> 02:30:55,200
Broke your heels or after.
Before when I was a kid.

3169
02:30:55,260 --> 02:30:57,480
When you were all crossfitted up.
He didn't like existence.

3170
02:30:57,880 --> 02:30:58,411
No,
I did.

3171
02:30:58,411 --> 02:31:01,160
Then
A.

3172
02:31:01,160 --> 02:31:01,760
Yeah,
you're right.

3173
02:31:01,760 --> 02:31:04,470
Then you were healthy and vibrant.
Yeah.

3174
02:31:04,530 --> 02:31:05,230
Energy.

3175
02:31:05,230 --> 02:31:06,290
Yeah.
Um,

3176
02:31:06,310 --> 02:31:11,050
I mean when I was like a young angsty,
like [inaudible] young man,

3177
02:31:11,110 --> 02:31:15,250
I'm very bitter about the world,
about a lot of very depressed.

3178
02:31:15,790 --> 02:31:16,480
Uh,
yeah.

3179
02:31:16,480 --> 02:31:18,760
I mean when I'd be,
when I started comedy,

3180
02:31:18,761 --> 02:31:21,870
when I've,
I mean I used to drink like a lunatic,

3181
02:31:21,871 --> 02:31:24,450
now I drink more like a normal person,
but um,

3182
02:31:24,900 --> 02:31:29,900
I would when I was my most hung over,
which I'd only get like four hangover as

3183
02:31:30,241 --> 02:31:31,420
a year.
Um,

3184
02:31:31,620 --> 02:31:34,350
but when I was as sick as I've ever
been,

3185
02:31:34,410 --> 02:31:38,550
that's when I get my best writing done.
It was like some self defense mechanism

3186
02:31:38,551 --> 02:31:41,160
where something like that.
My brain doesn't operate like that

3187
02:31:41,161 --> 02:31:41,994
anymore.
But,

3188
02:31:42,060 --> 02:31:44,010
well,
I think when you're in periods of

3189
02:31:44,150 --> 02:31:49,150
extreme emotion or energy or just a
transitionary mode in your life,

3190
02:31:49,581 --> 02:31:52,880
whether it's a,
a breakup or the end of a job,

3191
02:31:52,881 --> 02:31:56,090
or moving to a new place,
it's sort of kicks in this,

3192
02:31:56,900 --> 02:32:01,670
this effect is the newness,
the novelty of that experience sort of

3193
02:32:01,671 --> 02:32:04,640
kicks in this effect where you want to
express yourself.

3194
02:32:04,641 --> 02:32:06,850
You want to sort of reestablish,
you know,

3195
02:32:06,851 --> 02:32:08,510
your,
your point of view on things,

3196
02:32:08,511 --> 02:32:11,120
your perspective on things.
A lot of great stuff comes from that.

3197
02:32:11,121 --> 02:32:11,954
You know,
a lot of,

3198
02:32:12,240 --> 02:32:14,170
a lot of great music especially,
right?

3199
02:32:14,200 --> 02:32:16,790
I mean,
teen angst and anger is like,

3200
02:32:16,830 --> 02:32:19,220
wow,
where's the nirvana without angst,

3201
02:32:20,320 --> 02:32:21,050
right?
I mean,

3202
02:32:21,050 --> 02:32:24,200
one of the greatest bands of all time,
he raped me,

3203
02:32:24,201 --> 02:32:25,190
my friend.
Really?

3204
02:32:25,191 --> 02:32:26,060
Uh,
you know,

3205
02:32:26,090 --> 02:32:29,390
I mean,
that is just pure response to just the,

3206
02:32:29,480 --> 02:32:30,021
the,
the,

3207
02:32:30,021 --> 02:32:31,930
the frustrations of the world,

3208
02:32:32,020 --> 02:32:34,840
preaching to the choir.
And Nirvana was my first love dude

3209
02:32:35,600 --> 02:32:38,540
to this day.
Remember Buddy mind playing it for me.

3210
02:32:39,170 --> 02:32:40,250
And uh,
we,

3211
02:32:40,251 --> 02:32:42,860
it was a cassette tape and it was,
we're in Newton,

3212
02:32:42,861 --> 02:32:44,660
Massachusetts.
It wasn't even my friend who's my

3213
02:32:44,661 --> 02:32:46,130
friend,
Jimmy's friend were over his house.

3214
02:32:46,131 --> 02:32:47,120
He was like,
you got to hear this.

3215
02:32:47,180 --> 02:32:48,980
It's called Nirvana.
And we play.

3216
02:32:48,981 --> 02:32:50,540
And we were both like,
what the fuck?

3217
02:32:51,380 --> 02:32:54,260
This guy's went deep.
It was smells like teen spirit,

3218
02:32:54,261 --> 02:32:54,800
you know,

3219
02:32:54,800 --> 02:32:57,640
I hadn't really listened to any music.
Um,

3220
02:32:57,650 --> 02:33:01,550
at the time that I discovered Nirvana,
I discovered Nirvana through weird Al

3221
02:33:01,610 --> 02:33:04,250
did a parody of smells like teen spirit
that I liked.

3222
02:33:04,251 --> 02:33:07,250
And then I was like,
that music sounds pretty cool.

3223
02:33:07,251 --> 02:33:10,170
And then I found the real version and
that was like the first time I found

3224
02:33:10,171 --> 02:33:12,470
that I enjoyed music.
That wasn't a joke.

3225
02:33:12,770 --> 02:33:15,950
My friend Eddie was in a band back in
those days and he was like,

3226
02:33:16,070 --> 02:33:18,320
he was in a metal,
it was like a metal band.

3227
02:33:18,710 --> 02:33:20,810
And um,
he was like,

3228
02:33:20,870 --> 02:33:22,010
that song,
like,

3229
02:33:22,011 --> 02:33:26,570
that band completely killed metal.
They completely killed hair bands like

3230
02:33:26,600 --> 02:33:31,580
poison and those kinds of bands,
they just died because they seem so

3231
02:33:31,581 --> 02:33:32,414
silly,

3232
02:33:33,510 --> 02:33:34,343
you know,
like,

3233
02:33:34,920 --> 02:33:39,920
you know,
it just seemed like a,

3234
02:33:41,820 --> 02:33:42,620
you,
you,

3235
02:33:42,620 --> 02:33:43,630
it's,
you know,

3236
02:33:43,770 --> 02:33:47,490
it's like you had water in your ear and
you got the water out of your ear and

3237
02:33:47,870 --> 02:33:49,790
you could hear and you can,
hey man,

3238
02:33:49,800 --> 02:33:51,830
what's your stuff at Europe with cotton
mouth?

3239
02:33:52,380 --> 02:33:53,980
Do not wear makeup,
but no,

3240
02:33:53,990 --> 02:33:56,400
putting on hairspray.
I'm not teasing my hair up.

3241
02:33:57,480 --> 02:34:01,680
This is something about the,
the real rawness of that music.

3242
02:34:02,170 --> 02:34:03,750
I mean even guns n roses,
man.

3243
02:34:03,930 --> 02:34:05,820
Remember when Axel rose used to tease
his hair?

3244
02:34:06,060 --> 02:34:08,910
He says Harris all sprayed up and fucked
up like a,

3245
02:34:08,940 --> 02:34:11,820
like an eighties girl from Dallas.
That.

3246
02:34:12,120 --> 02:34:14,070
Yeah,
when Nirvana came along and it was like

3247
02:34:14,071 --> 02:34:15,480
losing them.
No more hairspray,

3248
02:34:15,481 --> 02:34:17,890
bro.
Let's just not working,

3249
02:34:17,891 --> 02:34:18,724
man.

3250
02:34:18,850 --> 02:34:19,683
Yeah,
I mean,

3251
02:34:20,190 --> 02:34:22,360
yeah,
there's so much great comedy that came

3252
02:34:22,361 --> 02:34:24,240
out of anger and go to.
Yeah,

3253
02:34:24,290 --> 02:34:25,123
there is areas

3254
02:34:25,260 --> 02:34:30,030
is teased up here.
If you go to the welcome to the jungle,

3255
02:34:30,180 --> 02:34:33,720
welcome to the jungle.
A video is the best example of it.

3256
02:34:34,620 --> 02:34:35,700
It's crazy,
man,

3257
02:34:35,701 --> 02:34:39,900
that the different shifts in culture and
what's acceptable and then just becomes

3258
02:34:39,901 --> 02:34:42,390
completely ridiculous.
Look at that,

3259
02:34:44,840 --> 02:34:46,370
get all that hair.
It's great

3260
02:34:46,390 --> 02:34:49,030
busy,
but that was what people did back then.

3261
02:34:49,690 --> 02:34:51,700
That was like a big,
a big look.

3262
02:34:52,570 --> 02:34:53,920
I'm ever.
He had so many tattoos.

3263
02:34:53,921 --> 02:34:54,760
I was like,
Oh my God,

3264
02:34:54,761 --> 02:34:56,560
that guy's ruined his body with all
those tattoos,

3265
02:34:56,561 --> 02:34:59,080
but I remember thinking that when I was
a kid,

3266
02:35:00,760 --> 02:35:02,570
still aI.
still haven't.

3267
02:35:02,630 --> 02:35:07,630
I'm a natural like midwestern aversion
to tattoos that like I think tattoos are

3268
02:35:09,930 --> 02:35:12,750
like I'm starting to grow and
appreciation for them,

3269
02:35:12,751 --> 02:35:17,400
but it's taken me work to,
to get there and I don't have any

3270
02:35:17,401 --> 02:35:19,400
myself.
It's embracing in the

3271
02:35:19,520 --> 02:35:22,700
finite
aspect of life.

3272
02:35:22,760 --> 02:35:25,940
This is not going to last like this idea
that you're going to ruin your body

3273
02:35:25,941 --> 02:35:27,410
forever.
Your body's not going to be around

3274
02:35:27,411 --> 02:35:28,440
forever.
You know,

3275
02:35:28,460 --> 02:35:30,060
like what's it gonna look like when
you're 80?

3276
02:35:30,070 --> 02:35:32,770
Do you think anybody wants to see your
back when you're 80?

3277
02:35:33,280 --> 02:35:36,380
It doesn't matter if this unit looks
like shit,

3278
02:35:37,020 --> 02:35:40,100
crazy wrinkly back and back,
and then when that time comes,

3279
02:35:40,101 --> 02:35:41,960
you're just going to be concentrating on
staying alive.

3280
02:35:42,300 --> 02:35:46,410
I liked the idea of having like little
snapshots from your life.

3281
02:35:46,470 --> 02:35:49,830
Even if even if say or tattoo has
nothing to do with anything,

3282
02:35:49,980 --> 02:35:54,120
the cool design,
you'll still remember that period of

3283
02:35:54,121 --> 02:35:57,750
your life a little bit more.
I think looking at that tattoo,

3284
02:35:57,751 --> 02:36:00,480
you'll remember when you got it and
where you were at that state.

3285
02:36:00,630 --> 02:36:01,880
That's what Anthony Bourdain has.

3286
02:36:01,950 --> 02:36:04,270
It was a gang of tattoos all from
different trips,

3287
02:36:04,450 --> 02:36:06,600
you know,
like get some different trips and so it

3288
02:36:06,610 --> 02:36:08,290
reminds them of that.
I got this in Bali,

3289
02:36:08,291 --> 02:36:09,850
this was from Hawaii.
This is.

3290
02:36:10,210 --> 02:36:13,630
And having something like that,
it's to him,

3291
02:36:13,631 --> 02:36:17,500
it's like these anchors for these
incredible experiences that he's at

3292
02:36:17,510 --> 02:36:20,680
because who the fuck has traveled more
over the world and that guy,

3293
02:36:20,681 --> 02:36:22,660
right?
I think you'd look good in a Japanese

3294
02:36:22,661 --> 02:36:23,494
body suit.
Dude.

3295
02:36:23,540 --> 02:36:26,830
What do you think?
What's the Japanese body suit go crazy

3296
02:36:26,831 --> 02:36:31,320
Yakuza style that go from the neck down.
They have everything all the way your

3297
02:36:31,330 --> 02:36:32,800
butt,
all the way down to your feet.

3298
02:36:33,400 --> 02:36:35,360
I'm not picturing what you're.
This guy.

3299
02:36:35,361 --> 02:36:38,290
I've never seen like a Yakuza Japanese
tattoo bodysuit.

3300
02:36:38,420 --> 02:36:40,540
Never seen.
This guy's crazy.

3301
02:36:40,870 --> 02:36:41,640
They do the whole.

3302
02:36:41,640 --> 02:36:43,070
Oh yeah,
that's you.

3303
02:36:44,170 --> 02:36:44,761
Yeah,
man.

3304
02:36:44,761 --> 02:36:46,140
I'm telling you.
You're missing out.

3305
02:36:46,840 --> 02:36:49,090
Is your future.
How do I not cold enough?

3306
02:36:49,140 --> 02:36:50,340
Thirty six.
Not too late.

3307
02:36:50,450 --> 02:36:51,900
Start now.
Start now.

3308
02:36:51,901 --> 02:36:53,320
You'd be done intentionally.
Skipped work.

3309
02:36:53,500 --> 02:36:54,980
You're 40 sexually.
Like this dude.

3310
02:36:55,010 --> 02:36:56,580
Who?
What's a good luck?

3311
02:36:56,970 --> 02:36:58,350
That's scary to me.
Yeah,

3312
02:36:58,390 --> 02:37:01,410
I do.
I do really like those three d tattoos.

3313
02:37:02,680 --> 02:37:03,840
Yeah,
like really good ones.

3314
02:37:03,841 --> 02:37:04,920
So yeah.
Yeah,

3315
02:37:04,921 --> 02:37:09,610
if you'd just like Google Three d tattoo
images with like the girls weird,

3316
02:37:09,611 --> 02:37:13,130
like creepy leg that looks hollow.
I'm like that.

3317
02:37:13,240 --> 02:37:14,430
That leg.
They're like,

3318
02:37:14,431 --> 02:37:16,040
I think that cool as fuck.
Oh yeah.

3319
02:37:16,040 --> 02:37:17,770
That's amazing.
That's one of the best fencer.

3320
02:37:18,620 --> 02:37:19,670
That's incredible.
Really.

3321
02:37:20,120 --> 02:37:21,980
It's bizarre.
It's so bizarre.

3322
02:37:22,050 --> 02:37:23,940
It's like a wood carving.
If you haven't seen it.

3323
02:37:23,941 --> 02:37:27,050
It looks like a.
she's like a thin piece of wood.

3324
02:37:27,051 --> 02:37:29,000
We've carved out recess,
isn't it?

3325
02:37:29,350 --> 02:37:34,030
I think if I was going to get something
at either be something like that or I

3326
02:37:34,031 --> 02:37:37,440
don't know that I'll ever have a memory
that I'll get a tattoo of a star.

3327
02:37:37,610 --> 02:37:39,650
Jamie will get that brick star in the
middle of the top.

3328
02:37:39,710 --> 02:37:40,970
Yeah.
Whoa.

3329
02:37:41,300 --> 02:37:43,610
Holy Shit.
That's incredible.

3330
02:37:44,330 --> 02:37:46,160
Like,
look what he's done to like the outer

3331
02:37:46,161 --> 02:37:48,650
skin where it looks like rip parchment.
Yeah.

3332
02:37:48,760 --> 02:37:50,030
It is all of his,
uh,

3333
02:37:50,480 --> 02:37:54,010
his ideas.
We had a great fucking tattoos tattoo.

3334
02:37:55,390 --> 02:37:56,900
Yeah.
It's a,

3335
02:37:56,950 --> 02:37:58,700
you know,
you've got to find a good artist too.

3336
02:37:58,880 --> 02:38:01,400
You got to have someone you trust to
draw on,

3337
02:38:01,401 --> 02:38:04,220
you know the guy's foot.
Fucking freak me out,

3338
02:38:04,221 --> 02:38:05,750
man.
Maybe you should get that shit

3339
02:38:06,720 --> 02:38:11,720
one binder to not jump so much of.
Yeah.

3340
02:38:12,320 --> 02:38:14,970
I still love heights to this day.
Really?

3341
02:38:15,060 --> 02:38:17,090
Yeah.
I won't jump off shit anymore because I

3342
02:38:17,091 --> 02:38:19,680
would feel silly if I hurt myself again,
but I can't get enough.

3343
02:38:20,210 --> 02:38:22,850
Did you see that?
I put a video up on instagram a couple

3344
02:38:22,851 --> 02:38:24,050
of days ago that someone sent me.

3345
02:38:24,730 --> 02:38:27,370
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

3346
02:38:27,390 --> 02:38:29,800
It was Kingston just posted of him up in
Hollywood.

3347
02:38:30,360 --> 02:38:32,460
He's the one that I put it.
It's pretty freaky,

3348
02:38:32,461 --> 02:38:37,461
but this other one is freaky because
it's like their most of it is looking

3349
02:38:37,561 --> 02:38:41,910
down and jumping down to their feet on
these little ledges like,

3350
02:38:41,911 --> 02:38:42,780
look at this,
watch this,

3351
02:38:42,840 --> 02:38:44,790
prepare to shit your pants.
Watch this,

3352
02:38:45,150 --> 02:38:45,983
watch this guy.

3353
02:38:46,950 --> 02:38:50,280
It drops down hanging over the edge.
I'm freaking out.

3354
02:38:50,281 --> 02:38:53,190
Just watching them.
See that's the kind of stuff that I

3355
02:38:53,191 --> 02:38:54,890
like.
I'm waiting.

3356
02:38:55,080 --> 02:38:59,460
I'm waiting to back.
I want to do that.

3357
02:38:59,700 --> 02:39:00,230
Oh,
let's see.

3358
02:39:00,230 --> 02:39:02,260
Did my hands are sweating right now?
I'm like,

3359
02:39:02,261 --> 02:39:02,921
dude,
just okay.

3360
02:39:02,921 --> 02:39:03,671
We did it.
We did it.

3361
02:39:03,671 --> 02:39:05,350
Let's get outta here.
Climbed back up.

3362
02:39:06,700 --> 02:39:10,030
I've done weird shit like that.
So even though you busted your.

3363
02:39:10,830 --> 02:39:12,830
Oh Jesus Christ.
Yeah,

3364
02:39:13,080 --> 02:39:15,170
that's,
that's,

3365
02:39:15,470 --> 02:39:18,480
that's something that I could see myself
doing.

3366
02:39:18,840 --> 02:39:21,450
Dammit.
I can't watch this.

3367
02:39:22,320 --> 02:39:23,790
You could see yourself doing that.
Really?

3368
02:39:23,970 --> 02:39:25,270
Yeah.
Jumping.

3369
02:39:25,450 --> 02:39:29,490
I don't know.
I just have always had like I've always

3370
02:39:29,520 --> 02:39:31,680
been a bit of an adrenaline junkie.
I just tend to.

3371
02:39:31,970 --> 02:39:35,730
I like pushing it a little too far.
It gets me in trouble sometimes.

3372
02:39:35,970 --> 02:39:38,370
Well,
I guess he did that one time many times

3373
02:39:38,371 --> 02:39:39,460
in my life.
Yeah.

3374
02:39:39,870 --> 02:39:43,710
What other times I've been in,
I've had to go to jail and stuff like

3375
02:39:43,711 --> 02:39:45,810
that.
Just for my.

3376
02:39:46,070 --> 02:39:50,760
I've had a,
just drinking mostly like way,

3377
02:39:50,761 --> 02:39:52,950
way,
way back before I was a comedian or

3378
02:39:52,951 --> 02:39:55,920
anything.
I had a couple of drunk driving tickets

3379
02:39:55,980 --> 02:40:00,250
and I've run from cops like 100 times in
my life because he wants.

3380
02:40:00,310 --> 02:40:01,270
Yeah,
no,

3381
02:40:01,271 --> 02:40:01,621
no,
no,

3382
02:40:01,621 --> 02:40:03,960
like on feet,
on a car twice.

3383
02:40:03,990 --> 02:40:07,890
Actually twice.
The first time I got away.

3384
02:40:07,891 --> 02:40:09,840
The second time I didn't.
Jesus Christ.

3385
02:40:09,841 --> 02:40:11,280
Dude.
Criminal.

3386
02:40:11,370 --> 02:40:12,203
Yeah.
Yeah.

3387
02:40:14,960 --> 02:40:19,380
I just had like this very sheltered,
wholesome upbringing that like fucked

3388
02:40:19,381 --> 02:40:24,381
with my head because it just wasn't like
I just knew it wasn't reality and I just

3389
02:40:24,540 --> 02:40:27,600
try to do everything that I could to
like rebel against it.

3390
02:40:27,740 --> 02:40:29,280
It's kind of car.
Were you drive when you were running

3391
02:40:29,281 --> 02:40:30,500
away from the cops?
Um,

3392
02:40:30,720 --> 02:40:34,860
I was driving a 95 Honda civic stick
shift.

3393
02:40:34,861 --> 02:40:39,570
All that happened was the opposite.
We raised the guy that I know.

3394
02:40:40,530 --> 02:40:45,530
So,
so the cop was driving past me and then

3395
02:40:45,720 --> 02:40:50,110
he saw me and then he had to turn around
and uh,

3396
02:40:50,111 --> 02:40:52,530
I think guys like speeding or something
like that and then,

3397
02:40:52,620 --> 02:40:55,740
but he had to go past me and turned
around and it was like in my

3398
02:40:55,741 --> 02:40:59,280
neighborhood and I knew exactly.
I just took a couple turns quick and hid

3399
02:40:59,281 --> 02:41:02,820
behind a building,
turned my lights off and I saw like I

3400
02:41:02,821 --> 02:41:03,980
saw them through these windows.

3401
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,020
It was real intense.
Pull up to the stop sign.

3402
02:41:06,030 --> 02:41:09,900
I saw him looking for me back and forth
through this road and then I saw him

3403
02:41:09,901 --> 02:41:13,950
take off in the other direction and then
I just fucking flipped around and I got

3404
02:41:13,951 --> 02:41:15,200
the hell out of there.
What was the,

3405
02:41:15,510 --> 02:41:19,040
what was he looking for you for?
I think I was just speeding and banks.

3406
02:41:19,640 --> 02:41:21,300
Yeah,
I think I met.

3407
02:41:21,301 --> 02:41:24,900
Who knows if I was like swerving or
whatever else or you just saw a kid that

3408
02:41:24,901 --> 02:41:25,550
was,
you know,

3409
02:41:25,550 --> 02:41:27,570
I was like 16,
17 at the time.

3410
02:41:27,571 --> 02:41:31,660
Saw a kid that was out at like one in
the morning or whatever and might've

3411
02:41:31,680 --> 02:41:32,850
done something.
I don't know,

3412
02:41:33,150 --> 02:41:35,780
the second time when I got caught,
um,

3413
02:41:37,500 --> 02:41:39,000
this is so fucking stupid.

3414
02:41:42,800 --> 02:41:47,800
I was driving and I was like flying.
I don't know what my reasoning was

3415
02:41:48,361 --> 02:41:49,470
exactly.
Like I said,

3416
02:41:49,471 --> 02:41:52,530
I was an adrenaline junkie but I was
like flying through stop signs and

3417
02:41:52,531 --> 02:41:54,780
stuff.
I was going 70 miles an hour in a 20

3418
02:41:54,781 --> 02:41:59,490
mile an hour zone and like three or four
in the morning I was trying to get back

3419
02:41:59,491 --> 02:42:01,620
to my friend's house before they went to
bed.

3420
02:42:01,621 --> 02:42:05,850
So I go to have a place to crash.
That was like my weird logic behind it.

3421
02:42:06,240 --> 02:42:11,240
And also it was fun for me to be be
trunk and driving this past and I blew

3422
02:42:12,481 --> 02:42:17,481
through stop signs and then I saw and
then I saw this car with its lights on

3423
02:42:18,140 --> 02:42:18,901
and I'm like,
fuck,

3424
02:42:18,901 --> 02:42:21,440
that's a cop.
But I just kept on driving anyway.

3425
02:42:21,450 --> 02:42:23,670
And I that fast.
And I kept on,

3426
02:42:23,671 --> 02:42:27,750
like swerving around corners and he was
catching up to me like pretty easily.

3427
02:42:28,170 --> 02:42:32,040
And um,
and then when he put his lights on I

3428
02:42:32,041 --> 02:42:34,530
pulled over and then he came up and I
was like,

3429
02:42:34,860 --> 02:42:37,890
oh,
thank God I thought you were this person

3430
02:42:37,891 --> 02:42:39,750
that was chasing me.
They had this,

3431
02:42:39,900 --> 02:42:44,470
this dodge neon that was like similar
kind of a made up like headlights that

3432
02:42:44,480 --> 02:42:46,620
would look similar.
Instastory yeah.

3433
02:42:46,650 --> 02:42:48,660
And,
and there's like a couple people,

3434
02:42:48,900 --> 02:42:51,540
a couple of cops showed up and I was,
because they called me in when,

3435
02:42:51,541 --> 02:42:52,440
uh,
when they're like,

3436
02:42:52,441 --> 02:42:53,760
this is,
this is chase.

3437
02:42:53,761 --> 02:42:55,140
But as soon as the guy put his lights
on,

3438
02:42:55,141 --> 02:42:58,860
I pulled right over and um,
and he,

3439
02:43:00,030 --> 02:43:03,540
uh,
I don't know if I was fucking fooling

3440
02:43:03,541 --> 02:43:06,140
these two dudes or what,
but it's like,

3441
02:43:06,210 --> 02:43:11,210
I think they're kind of let me go.
And then this woman cop showed up that

3442
02:43:11,531 --> 02:43:15,100
knew me because I have like $1,100
drinking tickets and shit.

3443
02:43:15,680 --> 02:43:17,260
She's like,
because that Shane Moss,

3444
02:43:17,350 --> 02:43:18,940
he's like,
he's up to something,

3445
02:43:19,090 --> 02:43:22,810
give them breath a lot.
And she comes over and I was wearing a

3446
02:43:22,811 --> 02:43:25,300
winter coat and she's like,
what's in your pockets?

3447
02:43:25,330 --> 02:43:30,330
And I looked down and there was,
I had two beer cans pocket,

3448
02:43:30,940 --> 02:43:35,350
but like going to bed more obvious I ah,
fuck.

3449
02:43:35,351 --> 02:43:38,500
And I took him out and then that was it.
That was my,

3450
02:43:38,800 --> 02:43:39,850
that was my second.
Dewey.

3451
02:43:40,240 --> 02:43:42,460
Yeah.
That never got another one good for,

3452
02:43:42,461 --> 02:43:43,720
you know.
Yeah,

3453
02:43:43,721 --> 02:43:48,040
that's a good time to end.
I was a 20 years old and I was,

3454
02:43:48,041 --> 02:43:50,820
I had a bit of arrested development.
I was a bit,

3455
02:43:51,160 --> 02:43:53,580
as a bit immature a bit.
Uh,

3456
02:43:53,760 --> 02:43:57,040
I was extremely rebellious,
a bit of an adrenaline junkie.

3457
02:43:57,150 --> 02:43:59,500
And where can people see your show?
Because we've got to wrap this up.

3458
02:43:59,520 --> 02:44:00,010
Yeah.
Yeah.

3459
02:44:00,010 --> 02:44:05,000
I have a 65 city tour with my show about
psychedelics.

3460
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:08,110
It's called a good trip.
So if you live in the United States,

3461

3466
