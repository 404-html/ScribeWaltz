1
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:06,523
He,

2
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,860
before we even get started,
I got to give a shout out to this dude,

3
00:00:11,861 --> 00:00:12,910
Aaron,
where is it?

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:13,540
Where's the,
uh,

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,280
not that,
but he gave us that.

6
00:00:15,281 --> 00:00:16,540
But the other thing,
the white snake,

7
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,630
oh,
there it is.

8
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,720
I told the story a long time ago about a
car accident and I got into when I had

9
00:00:22,721 --> 00:00:23,890
a,
I had an older girlfriend.

10
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:26,530
He's telling me what to do,
which is pretty hot though,

11
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:27,610
Stephanie,
how are you?

12
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,380
Um,
and she,

13
00:00:29,381 --> 00:00:32,490
uh,
she made me throw away this whitesnake

14
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,430
cassette after the car accident.
I had a little box of cassettes in my

15
00:00:36,431 --> 00:00:39,790
car and she said,
throw that out and that's fucking listen

16
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:40,870
to her.
All right.

17
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,330
So if you're in that state,
if you're in that situation right now,

18
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,750
will your interrelationship and the
person you're with tells you what to do

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,280
and you go,
fuck man,

20
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:50,260
I'm that bitch.
Why was that bitch wants to,

21
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,660
and I was bummed out,
man,

22
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,620
that I fucking threw out this whitesnake
cd wells cassette cassette,

23
00:00:56,621 --> 00:00:58,870
rather they would,
I didn't even have a CD player then

24
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,070
that.
When did they,

25
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:01,690
when did cds come out?
Officially

26
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,320
90,
80.

27
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,520
I feel like we've done 88

28
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:07,810
trying to figure this out before.
We just don't,

29
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,300
it's just not worthy enough.
Somewhere in the 80 [inaudible]

30
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,040
yeah,
early or late eighties,

31
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:14,260
I would say.
Cause I got my first one in,

32
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,730
I remember for my birthday when I was
like 16 or something like that.

33
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,660
17.
So this had to be

34
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:20,740
b,
a d eight.

35
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:24,220
Cause I know that after I broke up with
her,

36
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,070
I started fighting again.
I took like a break,

37
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:31,930
we broke up and then I have three more
fights after a date of her.

38
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:33,423
So,
uh,

39
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:36,430
like kickboxing fights.
So I remember the year,

40
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,310
uh,
so I'd had to be Ada,

41
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,740
which is 88 or 89.
But fucking,

42
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,920
I loved this cassette.
So that was,

43
00:01:44,921 --> 00:01:48,170
that was like a real moment of for me.
You know,

44
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,710
there's moments when you haven't
relationships where you'd go,

45
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,720
fuck,
I can't be this guy.

46
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,240
I can't,
I can't just let someone tell me what to

47
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:56,920
do.
And someone tried to change me.

48
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:01,030
Like she was a very smart girl and she
was older than me.

49
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,300
Like she was 25 and I was 21.
And I remember,

50
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,460
you know,
she was just smarter than me.

51
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,220
It lists,
it's certainly at the time more worldly

52
00:02:09,221 --> 00:02:12,520
than me and uh,
I just fucking listen to her.

53
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,320
It's not good man.

54
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,930
Don't you hate when you see your friends
in those situations though?

55
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,380
Like you see the friends that are,
that always fight every week and they're

56
00:02:20,381 --> 00:02:21,640
always breaking up in there.

57
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,570
Yeah,
it's awful.

58
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:28,250
In her defense,
I was a fucking idiot in her defense,

59
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,110
so I,
she was trying to shape me up,

60
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,550
you know,
it was an interesting like,

61
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,740
you know what I knew I couldn't hang out
with her anymore,

62
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:38,270
was um,
there was an incident at a comedy club

63
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,550
that I've told before.
I don't want to repeat it again because

64
00:02:40,551 --> 00:02:43,040
the person that I talked about,
like [inaudible] talked about it in the

65
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:45,540
Jamie Kilstein podcast,
the person I was talking about is

66
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,810
completely delusional and their
perception of these events,

67
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,820
I don't want to even rehash who the
original person was that I'd gotten this

68
00:02:52,821 --> 00:02:55,820
dispute with,
but I wound up walking off the stage

69
00:02:55,821 --> 00:02:59,950
because I was disgusted by how this
professional comedian was censoring

70
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:03,330
people at an open mic night.
And um,

71
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,770
Stephanie,
who's,

72
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,060
by the way,
awesome.

73
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,640
Never anything but awesome.
She was very cool person.

74
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,790
So I've never hated her or anything,
but she,

75
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,320
you know,
she pulled me aside and she like Kinda

76
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,160
like lectured me.
She's like,

77
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:19,450
look,
if you want to do this,

78
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,520
if you want to do this,
then you have to really do it.

79
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:24,820
You can't walk off stage like that.
That's completely unprofessional.

80
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,470
And I'm like,
I'm not a professional.

81
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,330
I'm like,
I'm an amateur.

82
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:28,961
Like,
yeah,

83
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:30,610
it's unprofessional.
I'm trying to learn how to do it.

84
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:34,870
And then I realized like that's not how
you talk to people that are in your

85
00:03:34,871 --> 00:03:37,600
life,
that if you don't like what they're

86
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:38,770
doing,
like you have,

87
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,420
there's,
there's gotta be a better way of

88
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:44,470
approaching it than that.
Her way of approaching it was from like

89
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:47,740
a mother perspective,
I can authoritative perspective,

90
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,390
you know,
it was weird.

91
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,430
It was a weird relationship in that
respect.

92
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,770
And when you see those relationships,
the problem is

93
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,620
not,
I don't want to generalize,

94
00:03:56,621 --> 00:04:01,120
but oftentimes in relationships,
the dynamic that the relationship begins

95
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:04,180
with is the dynamic the relationship
sticks with.

96
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,690
And if you get stuck in a relationship
where one person is telling you what to

97
00:04:07,691 --> 00:04:11,170
do,
it very rarely goes back the other way.

98
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,490
And then you tell them what to do and
then they listened.

99
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:18,430
It never does.
It's like you develop like a chief and

100
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:21,600
the rest of the Indians,
you know there's a captain and then

101
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,470
there's the sailors and it's just the
way it is.

102
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,030
Man.
I don't know why,

103
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,860
but with her,
like early on she assumed the role of

104
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:33,610
the one who is like dictating what was
okay and not okay,

105
00:04:33,611 --> 00:04:36,220
what kind of music I should like,
how I should dress.

106
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,290
It's real weird man.
But again,

107
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:42,550
she wasn't a bad person.
She was a 25 year old girl dating a 21

108
00:04:42,551 --> 00:04:46,000
year old guy who was crazy.
And you know,

109
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:47,260
when girls are 25,
they're like,

110
00:04:47,261 --> 00:04:47,951
okay,
what am I doing?

111
00:04:47,951 --> 00:04:49,960
Am I going to marry this guy?
I'm going to have kids with this fucking

112
00:04:49,961 --> 00:04:50,790
idiot.

113
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,630
I got to shape them up.
I've got to get them to stop listening

114
00:04:52,631 --> 00:04:54,990
to white snake.
I mean,

115
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,250
I think I do that every almost every
relationship though.

116
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,690
Like oh yeah,
she uh,

117
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,630
you know,
and then coincidentally you often dig,

118
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,140
always great girls younger than you.
Yeah,

119
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,410
yeah,
definitely.

120
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,620
Always and never fixable.
Like as hard as I tried.

121
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,430
Not that fix of all

122
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,210
21 to 25 is,
um,

123
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,490
it doesn't seem that old,
like for a guide.

124
00:05:16,491 --> 00:05:18,620
What girl?
And again,

125
00:05:18,621 --> 00:05:22,100
I don't like to generalize,
but I definitely think that girls mature

126
00:05:22,101 --> 00:05:24,320
quicker than guys.
100% oh yeah.

127
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:25,740
I think that's common knowledge,
right?

128
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,220
Well,
I've been trying to figure out why.

129
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,930
I've been trying to figure out what it
is.

130
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,190
Parents,
man.

131
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,510
No,
I think it's ego.

132
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:36,770
I think it's ego.
I think men have spent so much time

133
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,520
coddling the male ego worried about
this.

134
00:05:40,521 --> 00:05:41,600
Fuck,
go fuck kicked.

135
00:05:41,601 --> 00:05:42,720
This guy's us.
You know?

136
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:46,250
Fuck that guy up.
Like posturing and presenting themselves

137
00:05:46,251 --> 00:05:49,670
like especially when they're really
young as something better than they

138
00:05:49,671 --> 00:05:52,550
actually are.
It's like a big part of being a young

139
00:05:52,551 --> 00:05:57,551
man until you realize somewhere around
your thirties I guess that nobody buys

140
00:05:59,631 --> 00:06:01,460
that.
Like nobody buys that.

141
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,990
Like when you're posturing and you're
pretending to be someone other than you

142
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,770
are,
you think you're giving yourself some

143
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:10,430
sort of weird comfort or trying to,
but it's like sucking your thumb.

144
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,160
It's not really effective.
It's not really doing anything.

145
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,260
Women don't have that.
They don't have the,

146
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:18,170
I'll kick your ass.
They don't have the this guy.

147
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,240
What does guy think he's going to fuck
my wife?

148
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,920
It was his gun.
I think he's going to take my job was

149
00:06:22,921 --> 00:06:25,670
this guy thinks he's going to fucking
move in next to me and put up a fucking

150
00:06:25,671 --> 00:06:26,650
fence in front of mark.
Fuck,

151
00:06:26,651 --> 00:06:30,260
that's my fucking,
but when men get this weird thing,

152
00:06:30,261 --> 00:06:34,580
man,
they get this weird male thing and women

153
00:06:34,581 --> 00:06:36,020
don't get that thing.
They get different.

154
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,640
They get pitched things,
they get,

155
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:39,260
they get a,
they get their own thing.

156
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,590
You know they get the bitch at each
other but it's not,

157
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:46,370
this is not nearly as like physical for
the most part,

158
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,920
you know,
it's much more likely that two man are

159
00:06:48,921 --> 00:06:49,970
going to throw bones.

160
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:53,090
Then two girls like when two girls
fight,

161
00:06:53,091 --> 00:06:56,360
it's like Holy Shit.
They went for it.

162
00:06:56,361 --> 00:06:59,810
They like physically trying to claw each
other's eyes out and usually at least

163
00:06:59,811 --> 00:07:02,690
one of them is out of their fucking
minds.

164
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,450
If you get two girls,
obviously not talking about martial arts

165
00:07:05,451 --> 00:07:08,570
competition,
but if you get two girls involved in a

166
00:07:08,571 --> 00:07:10,370
street fight,
at least one of them is out of their

167
00:07:10,371 --> 00:07:15,371
fucking mind.
He said the best like to sane dudes

168
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:20,120
under the right conditions with alcohol
involved could beat the shit out of each

169
00:07:20,121 --> 00:07:21,650
other.
It's very possible,

170
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,170
very possible,
especially with alcohol involved,

171
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:29,740
but two girls pulling hair and club,
I would venture the vast majority of

172
00:07:30,171 --> 00:07:35,171
women out there have never been in a
fistfight because vast majority,

173
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,060
80% yeah,
I think that's a good number.

174
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,720
I think 80% of kid number,
it's probably not right.

175
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,470
So they,
I think they're,

176
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,211
they're,
you know,

177
00:07:44,211 --> 00:07:49,211
they have different,
different things going on and I think

178
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,210
even if they want to be respected and
they want to be appreciated,

179
00:07:53,211 --> 00:07:55,550
it's not the same as like the male
thing,

180
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:59,390
the male wanting to be respected,
especially our young men.

181
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:04,780
It's very difficult to get over just the
natural monkey instincts that boys have.

182
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:10,760
Just those natural monkey instincts.
There's so God damn distracting.

183
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,460
That I think is maybe this is just the
theory,

184
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:18,500
not even biologically why women be sure
in general faster than men.

185
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:22,160
It might just be this,
the lack of the struggle with that male

186
00:08:22,161 --> 00:08:22,994
ego.

187
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,060
Yeah.
Brian and I talked to him about it.

188
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,410
Yeah.
Is it?

189
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:33,520
Do you ever have male instincts to like
buy a girl's neck when you're having sex

190
00:08:33,521 --> 00:08:34,970
with her like that,
that kind of,

191
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,630
that seems like you'd be somebody that
would be like a neck bite or you'd be

192
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,610
really into it and just go,

193
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,630
do you not want you beaten off?
Thinking about how I fun so I will stop

194
00:08:42,631 --> 00:08:46,700
this conversation right here.
It's,

195
00:08:46,701 --> 00:08:47,281
you know what,
it's,

196
00:08:47,281 --> 00:08:48,840
it's different with different girls,
right?

197
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,610
Isn't it?
With different girls you dated.

198
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,180
Some girls like to get choked.
They just do.

199
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,640
I hate all that.
When a girl tells me to slap him or

200
00:08:56,641 --> 00:08:57,880
choke him,
that's the word.

201
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,400
I can't do it.
I'm not going to beat you up and going

202
00:09:00,401 --> 00:09:03,900
to have to get that from somebody else.
You're going to have to call her Ari.

203
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,420
Do you think the daddy thing,
there's something there.

204
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,430
When girls are like,
fuck me harder daddy,

205
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:10,590
when is the whole daddy thing?
Do you think there's something to it?

206
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,050
It's a dirty,
yeah,

207
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,980
it's dirty.
They don't mean their dad.

208
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:17,490
They mean you.
They want you to be their daddy in that

209
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:19,170
moment.
Not even like a father,

210
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,470
but like,
like the data that's given the Dick,

211
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,840
you know,
they don't even think it's like a

212
00:09:24,841 --> 00:09:28,020
different word.
It's a different use of the word Daddy,

213
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,090
you know?
It doesn't mean the same thing.

214
00:09:30,091 --> 00:09:32,130
It's like when you call someone captain,
sub captain,

215
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,080
you don't really think that guy has a
boat.

216
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:35,840
But what if they follow me?
Yeah,

217
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,530
I told her.
But the thing you say,

218
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:41,400
there's one girl says it as a kid though
and she doesn't talk like a kid in any

219
00:09:41,401 --> 00:09:43,530
other times except when she's having sex
and he's like,

220
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:48,000
Hey,
she request is into like tolerable.

221
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,090
Yeah.
Well she dating you.

222
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,740
Yeah.
Some dark shit happened.

223
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,530
Yeah,
but see I go deeper in it.

224
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,321
I was like,
yeah,

225
00:09:56,321 --> 00:10:01,321
you're like daddy for school wise while
you're fucking her.

226
00:10:01,481 --> 00:10:03,180
Yeah.
Just to see you leave for school.

227
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,320
I mean like I'm going to try to go down
that path.

228
00:10:07,321 --> 00:10:09,300
If she brings it up,
I'll see if she plays along.

229
00:10:09,301 --> 00:10:10,530
If she plays along,
it's like fun.

230
00:10:10,531 --> 00:10:13,860
It's like trying to learn more about
this person that I'm fucking,

231
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:16,810
you know what's even more disturbing
saying are you leaving for school?

232
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,300
Cause that means it's morning sex.

233
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:21,240
Like the dad doesn't even have the
excuse of being drunk

234
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:27,570
coffee and fucks his daughter.
That is God.

235
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,080
Yeah.
Just not your homework.

236
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,620
Yeah.
You need to find better people,

237
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,870
but you know,
you gotta work on yourself.

238
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:34,980
Right.
I know.

239
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,200
Get your own shit in order and you'll
attract people.

240
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:40,940
I don't make a noise.
I just don't breathe.

241
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:45,210
I slobber in their hair and I
don't do anything.

242
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,940
Do you still take those pills?
I,

243
00:10:47,941 --> 00:10:49,670
you know,
I stopped at when I started sharing

244
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,950
playing boner pills,
uh,

245
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,170
gas station,
boner pills,

246
00:10:52,171 --> 00:10:54,000
gas station,
boner pills specifically.

247
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:58,530
Brian has like some gas stations picked
out in the valley that he travels to

248
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:02,550
have Chinese drugs in them that make
your dick a totem pole.

249
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,670
Yeah,
they,

250
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:04,980
they,
they're very sketchy.

251
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,290
Uh,
you can go to fda.gov and see all the

252
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,180
ingredients and all the ones that
they've tested and,

253
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,330
but I stopped doing it when I start
tripping.

254
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,880
Like I,
I actually saw visuals,

255
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:17,520
I think I've talked about it on this,
but recently they've had new packaging

256
00:11:17,521 --> 00:11:19,320
where they're like,
holograms and like they're,

257
00:11:19,321 --> 00:11:22,510
they're awesome packaging.
Like it's a horse running or,

258
00:11:22,511 --> 00:11:23,344
or,
uh,

259
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,650
like black stallion.
A good one.

260
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,470
Here's a question.
How much do you think it would cost us

261
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:33,240
to randomly test the gas station pills
that you take and then read the results

262
00:11:33,241 --> 00:11:36,840
on the air?
It probably have some right now that

263
00:11:36,841 --> 00:11:39,150
you've saved.
Just packaging in my car.

264
00:11:39,151 --> 00:11:42,540
I say about 30 different ones in my car.
But you have the packages.

265
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,470
Okay.
Set aside one package of each one that

266
00:11:46,471 --> 00:11:49,410
you really enjoy blacks down here right
now.

267
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,530
I want to set these aside and I want to
see how much it costs.

268
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:55,360
I'll go through the u s uh,
the UFC labs,

269
00:11:55,361 --> 00:11:57,910
whatever they use.
I think they use their Nevada state

270
00:11:57,911 --> 00:12:00,190
athletic commission I think uses quest
diagnostics,

271
00:12:00,191 --> 00:12:03,760
but they test blood,
they test blood and urine.

272
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,850
We can't do that,
but we'll find out a place where we

273
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,190
could send it to a lab to get the
contents.

274
00:12:09,191 --> 00:12:11,680
Analog Sda has done well on,
it's done it.

275
00:12:11,681 --> 00:12:13,870
So I'll just use,
I'll use whatever guys on it's done.

276
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,280
But FDA has done it for these ones that
you're taking,

277
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,210
do you think they're the consistent,
like they're not the same every week.

278
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,190
They change.
You could tell they change their

279
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:24,310
ingredients sometimes.
Like I had one burst open my mouth the

280
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,730
other day and it tastes like tea,
but I've had it before where I burst

281
00:12:27,731 --> 00:12:31,690
open my mouth and it tasted like pills
like inside of a pill,

282
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,180
like a chemical neurol.
Um,

283
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,580
they're all powder inside.
Some of them are powdered.

284
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:38,890
There's the one that I had the other day
was like a t,

285
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:41,570
like almost like weed inside.
But are any of them uh,

286
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,420
gels,
like,

287
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,410
uh,
they're all seem to be like a powder

288
00:12:44,411 --> 00:12:46,780
inside and,
but like these new ones,

289
00:12:46,781 --> 00:12:50,440
like the latest one black stallion where
it has like a Hologram of a horse

290
00:12:50,441 --> 00:12:51,310
running,
uh,

291
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,490
that one legit four days a boner solid.

292
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And like,
I was like really studying it the other

293
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,421
day.
Cause it's,

294
00:12:58,421 --> 00:13:01,720
it's,
it's just like every single pocket of

295
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,700
Shit on your Dick.
It's just full.

296
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:05,440
It's swollen.
Like it's,

297
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,810
it's hard though.
It feels uncomfortable.

298
00:13:07,811 --> 00:13:09,220
Like it doesn't feel like you're normal
dick,

299
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:10,510
where it's like,
oh this is comfortable.

300
00:13:10,511 --> 00:13:13,870
Super high dose of Viagra.
I don't think it's my anger anymore.

301
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,030
I think it used to be,
I don't think this is by,

302
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,970
I think this is like some kind of
reaction cause it's like my dick is

303
00:13:18,971 --> 00:13:23,380
swollen up.
Like it's got got bit by a snake.

304
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,030
Oh it's powerful though,
man.

305
00:13:26,031 --> 00:13:28,870
I like girls can tell immediate like,
like holy shit,

306
00:13:28,871 --> 00:13:31,070
that's that you're killing me here.
So,

307
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:35,320
but when you're taking this stuff,
does it go down or do you have to like

308
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:40,330
deal with a hard dick for hours?
It's just on call but it's ready to

309
00:13:40,331 --> 00:13:40,850
rock.

310
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:45,850
But when you wake up cars,
but when you wake up in the morning it's

311
00:13:46,031 --> 00:13:48,460
like,
it's a lot of times it's like p plus

312
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:50,530
that.
It's like if you fuck a girl in the

313
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:54,100
morning with a p boner mixed with that
at the same time she's dead.

314
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:56,380
Oh poor girl.
Yeah.

315
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:00,070
Poor Lady.
What am I talking about?

316
00:14:00,071 --> 00:14:01,510
This?
It's hilarious.

317
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,710
It's so weird that I do it though.
And it's only like if like if I'm with a

318
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:06,670
new girl,
I'd be like,

319
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:08,440
you know what?
I'm going to really impress her tonight

320
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:13,530
with this big snake venom.
Dick and roses is burnout.

321
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:16,570
Just that you don't want to set too to
higher standard.

322
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,590
What's embarrassing knows I collect them
and,

323
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,570
and it's,
it looks like a crazy person.

324
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:25,150
If you go in my car right now and if I
pulled out all the ones I had in my car,

325
00:14:25,151 --> 00:14:26,560
it looks like a crazy,
crazy.

326
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:28,840
People will say,
if you didn't know me think I'm crazy.

327
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,900
Isn't that funny?
That's a funny thing people do.

328
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,360
You would think I was crazy if you've
paid attention to everything I do and

329
00:14:37,361 --> 00:14:42,361
everything I said,
but if we could test him within a

330
00:14:42,761 --> 00:14:46,000
reasonable financial range,
we should totally for cost a couple of

331
00:14:46,001 --> 00:14:48,070
grand or something.
FDA though it really has gone through a

332
00:14:48,071 --> 00:14:49,160
lot of it.
Most of it though,

333
00:14:49,161 --> 00:14:51,980
it's been steroids.
Like a lot of them have had small

334
00:14:51,981 --> 00:14:54,620
amounts of steroids in it.
And I was wondering when you were saying

335
00:14:54,621 --> 00:14:56,840
that you hallucinated yeah,
it was a bath salts.

336
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,660
It dude.
I had to do a set,

337
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,160
I was in um,
in uh,

338
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,970
tempe Improv or no standup live in
Arizona.

339
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,910
I was,
I took some before then and I was with

340
00:15:07,911 --> 00:15:10,160
Tony Hinchcliffe and I was telling Tony
was like,

341
00:15:10,161 --> 00:15:11,540
man,
I don't know if I can go on stage.

342
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:15,710
Like I am seeing trails right now.
I had to go on stage like tripping and I

343
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,640
talked about it on stage.

344
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,460
Like I'm sorry if I'm crazy right now.
Like you guys are all like,

345
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,730
like swirls and stuff.
Like,

346
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,510
but that's how bad it was.
Like I can't see shit.

347
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:27,230
So that's when I kind of stopped my fun
hobby.

348
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,750
Damn Dude,
that's so dangerous.

349
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:34,160
He just rolling the dice that these
people in this gas station laboratory

350
00:15:34,161 --> 00:15:35,550
are not going to kill you.
Yeah.

351
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,790
And what's crazy,
a couple of them are like,

352
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:41,800
I tried to find more information about
the companies that make it good luck.

353
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,780
They don't access shadow governments in
the Philippines.

354
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,550
Yeah.
Well this is my question.

355
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:51,080
Like they did have an ingredients.
Like is it say like you look at the

356
00:15:51,081 --> 00:15:52,460
package,
it says what's in there?

357
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,230
No.
Well it does.

358
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:56,390
It does,
but you can tell it's not what it is.

359
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,270
It's say on the package.
Should have rented my car real quick and

360
00:15:59,271 --> 00:16:00,080
get it.
A couple of kids.

361
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,900
I've got to go get one.
We're going to talk shit about you while

362
00:16:02,901 --> 00:16:03,734
you're gone.

363
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,820
He's so ridiculous.
Do you know anybody else that takes

364
00:16:08,821 --> 00:16:10,680
those things?
The only thing I've ever,

365
00:16:10,681 --> 00:16:12,570
I've taken something,
not I boner pill,

366
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:15,260
but I remember taking a bumblebee or
black,

367
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,180
something like that,
but like I can stick a caffeine pill.

368
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:18,690
Oh,
okay.

369
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,160
I can go on stage or if me and my
friends,

370
00:16:20,161 --> 00:16:22,560
we would take him like Jack ourselves up
before a concert and feel like we're

371
00:16:22,561 --> 00:16:23,910
going to have a heart attack.
Yeah.

372
00:16:23,911 --> 00:16:24,470
Like,
um,

373
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:26,910
it was probably like rip fuel,
like that kind of stuff.

374
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:29,100
The Federer or something like that.
It was bad for us too.

375
00:16:29,101 --> 00:16:32,280
We knew those were horrible for you.
But see those things,

376
00:16:32,281 --> 00:16:35,320
at least other people were taking them.
Who the fuck do you know?

377
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:39,300
Pioneer gas station,
boner pills and I'm going to do top,

378
00:16:39,301 --> 00:16:43,080
they're like David Crockett.
He's setting a standard and he is

379
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:50,400
just such a ridiculous thing to want to
put in your body when the alternative

380
00:16:50,401 --> 00:16:51,270
exists.

381
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:54,000
Like you could go to an actual doctor
and say,

382
00:16:54,001 --> 00:16:56,850
I have a hard time getting an erection.
He'll prescribe you viagara.

383
00:16:56,851 --> 00:17:00,120
We all know that doesn't kill you.
Maybe this is the weed of boner pills.

384
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,490
It's easy to get.
You can get it anywhere.

385
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,560
That's true.
It definitely is that you don't have to

386
00:17:04,561 --> 00:17:05,470
go to a doctor.
Yeah,

387
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:06,551
that's what I mean by that.
Well,

388
00:17:06,551 --> 00:17:08,550
it used to not have to go to doctors for
stuff.

389
00:17:08,551 --> 00:17:11,790
You used to be able to get things
through Canadian pharmacies.

390
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,160
Canadian pharmacies would just send new
drugs.

391
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:16,380
It was like the big loophole.
How do people get,

392
00:17:16,381 --> 00:17:19,200
you can get like that nuvigil stuff.
You can get free samples online or

393
00:17:19,201 --> 00:17:20,760
something I've seen.
I don't know how you get up.

394
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:21,960
Yeah.
I don't know.

395
00:17:21,961 --> 00:17:25,140
New vigils.
A little different or maybe one version

396
00:17:25,141 --> 00:17:26,910
of it.
Provigil or Nuvigil.

397
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,290
I know for sure.

398
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:33,290
I've read guys st posting on message
boards saying that they bought that

399
00:17:33,301 --> 00:17:35,460
stuff somewhere online.
I think it was the underground.

400
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,410
Yeah,
you can buy it from this like weird

401
00:17:37,411 --> 00:17:40,050
India set us the new one.
Rhino too.

402
00:17:40,051 --> 00:17:41,940
This is the one with the Hologram.
You're not gonna be able to probably

403
00:17:41,941 --> 00:17:44,260
pick that up.
It's rhino 11 cause it's supposed to be

404
00:17:44,261 --> 00:17:47,750
11 days at lasts 11 vulner real.
Yeah.

405
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,980
No it's not.
It comes in is we look at this capsule.

406
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:51,750
It comes in.
This is just for the pill.

407
00:17:51,751 --> 00:17:54,690
It's like this weird matrix capsule.
Oh Dude.

408
00:17:54,691 --> 00:17:57,570
How bad are these?
Meanwhile look at this.

409
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:02,780
It says this is hilarious.
It says platinum 6,000 like as if

410
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:08,331
there's some like measuring going on
like what's zero platinum?

411
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:11,640
4,000 yeah.
Come on.

412
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,800
Why are you pretending you have any
idea?

413
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:17,340
Is people making these just thrown some
shit in a bowl and mix it up while

414
00:18:17,341 --> 00:18:18,174
they're drunk?

415
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,430
They're not.
They don't know what the fuck's in

416
00:18:20,431 --> 00:18:23,520
there.
Platinum 6,000 fuck.

417
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:26,820
These are two companies too,
but that both use rhinos.

418
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:32,550
Why wouldn't you use Ryan when his
doctor Rhino and when is rhino 11?

419
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,310
Well,
Rhino is what those Asian people,

420
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,830
um,
believe that rhino horns give you a rank

421
00:18:38,831 --> 00:18:40,470
reaction.
That's why they've killed so many

422
00:18:40,471 --> 00:18:43,260
rhinos.
The reason why rhino horns or we're so

423
00:18:43,261 --> 00:18:45,090
much,
and have you ever seen a Rhino Horn?

424
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,250
It doesn't even make any sense.
They're just gross.

425
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:51,420
It's like hair.
It's a giant hard like piece of

426
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:54,990
fingernail or hair.
Whereas like if you look at elephant

427
00:18:54,991 --> 00:18:55,681
tusks,
you go,

428
00:18:55,681 --> 00:18:57,450
well I kind of get it.
That's beautiful.

429
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,650
Those are,
those are amazing.

430
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:01,590
Rhino horns don't look cool.
They're gross looking at hill.

431
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:02,700
Yeah,
look at that.

432
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,910
And so they take those things and then
make some Chinese medicine.

433
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,320
That doesn't even work.

434
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,520
It doesn't even work.
I mean that doesn't make your dick hard.

435
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,220
It's,
we have viagara and they're still

436
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:17,130
killing rhinos.
So this actually has ingredients on it.

437
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,040
Like Chinese daughter seed,
asparagus.

438
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,440
There's a spare gas in here.
Asparagus.

439
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,960
Why would they put asparagus?
They want your penis smell different so

440
00:19:24,961 --> 00:19:26,640
that you really feel like something's
happening.

441
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,150
That's true.
Or they just put asparagus to make it

442
00:19:30,151 --> 00:19:30,481
go,
oh,

443
00:19:30,481 --> 00:19:33,240
it's healthy.
It's got asparagus 10 and it has none of

444
00:19:33,241 --> 00:19:35,220
that.
Maybe both arguments were brought up at

445
00:19:35,221 --> 00:19:38,070
the meeting while they were cooking up.
Fuck it.

446
00:19:38,071 --> 00:19:42,450
Best Bathtub Meth,
the Rhino 12 let's add some Kale.

447
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,100
The problem is,
man,

448
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,580
I don't want any fucking gangsters
coming out of us and trying to kill us

449
00:19:47,581 --> 00:19:50,340
because we out what their products are.
You know,

450
00:19:50,341 --> 00:19:54,720
because these products are not being
made by above board now folks,

451
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:57,720
most likely now,
and they constantly are changing their

452
00:19:57,721 --> 00:19:58,020
names.

453
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,790
Like if you go through my collection of
these,

454
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,750
these,
these,

455
00:20:00,751 --> 00:20:03,390
I don't know why I keep these,
but they're all different names.

456
00:20:03,391 --> 00:20:05,100
There's not one.
That's what they have to.

457
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,910
Aubrey was telling us what happens.
This is what rb says I want.

458
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,510
I'm probably butchering it,
but Aubrey said that these people make

459
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:14,400
this stuff.
They put in Viagara,

460
00:20:14,401 --> 00:20:17,010
which they buy from some Chinese
manufacturer.

461
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,810
They take that stuff.
What does,

462
00:20:18,811 --> 00:20:21,750
what does it Modafinil,
is that what it's called?

463
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:22,920
Yeah.
Okay.

464
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:28,040
So they buy that stuff in bulk and then
they sell it for much more than it would

465
00:20:28,051 --> 00:20:30,690
be if they sold it.
And like if you sell a prescription for

466
00:20:30,691 --> 00:20:32,310
like a hundred pills be x amount of
dollars,

467
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:37,080
but if you can stuff it into two gas
station bullshit pills and sell each one

468
00:20:37,081 --> 00:20:39,270
for 10 bucks,
like how much is a rhino to costs?

469
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:43,470
Well these new ones with the holograms
are like $14 but they last,

470
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,180
they do,
they don't last 11 days where they

471
00:20:45,181 --> 00:20:48,010
definitely last a week.
But if that was dessert are only two

472
00:20:48,011 --> 00:20:51,160
pills,
if that was a bottle of Viagra,

473
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:56,170
I mean $14 it wouldn't be two pills for
$14 it's where they probably make like

474
00:20:56,171 --> 00:21:00,010
100% more and Viagra is bitch compared
to that.

475
00:21:00,011 --> 00:21:00,581
This,
you know,

476
00:21:00,581 --> 00:21:03,580
like this will beat the shit out of
Viagara cause this has like something

477
00:21:03,581 --> 00:21:06,160
that makes it,
like Viagra is cool but it lasts a

478
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:06,881
couple hours.
It doesn't really do,

479
00:21:06,881 --> 00:21:09,250
it just makes you have a boner kind of.
But this is like,

480
00:21:09,251 --> 00:21:11,740
no,
you got bit by a snake boner for for

481
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,090
awhile.
Yeah,

482
00:21:13,091 --> 00:21:14,940
I don't.
I would like to try it,

483
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:17,850
but it's not worth it and when it gets
you one of the best ones to do it,

484
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:21,820
I found that review of some of the
dangers that took rhinos seven Oh,

485
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:22,773
this one right here.

486
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,320
This is all that like breakdown of all
the different ingredients and whatnot of

487
00:21:26,321 --> 00:21:27,154
it.
Oh,

488
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:31,110
put that shit up.
The main ingredient is called slide sill

489
00:21:31,111 --> 00:21:34,750
that stilled naf believed in Nashville,
which is the active ingredient in

490
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:35,950
Viagra.
Oh,

491
00:21:35,951 --> 00:21:36,950
okay.
Sold the Nafa,

492
00:21:36,951 --> 00:21:38,730
all that stuff.
I would look at it.

493
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:39,401
It says right to,
yeah.

494
00:21:39,401 --> 00:21:43,240
Why did I think it was modafinil?
Madame isn't modafinil or Nuvigil.

495
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:44,563
Okay.
That's it.

496
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:47,650
If you go up a little,
this is a serious side effects like

497
00:21:47,651 --> 00:21:49,300
headache,
nausea and blurred vision.

498
00:21:49,301 --> 00:21:53,590
I had that blurred vision part and
that's what made me stop these side

499
00:21:53,591 --> 00:21:57,070
effects that generally appear when using
prescription ed medication.

500
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:01,360
It's funny too because yet the label
specifically makes the claim no

501
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,370
headache.
That's one of the primary complaints

502
00:22:03,371 --> 00:22:06,420
about the supplement stuff that was in
it.

503
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,380
Okay.
I think her issues really make a lot of

504
00:22:08,381 --> 00:22:08,680
sense.

505
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,600
I guess that's what it says was in it.
Yeah.

506
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,300
Well what about what he found was in it.
Okay,

507
00:22:13,301 --> 00:22:14,590
well we'll,
we just read what it says.

508
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:16,390
Go Gee extract.
Dang.

509
00:22:16,391 --> 00:22:18,760
Sen extract,
cinnamon bark,

510
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:19,181
blah,
blah,

511
00:22:19,181 --> 00:22:20,320
blah.
Licorice.

512
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,440
Bunch of Bullshit Jensen.
Okay,

513
00:22:23,441 --> 00:22:25,690
so what's actually in it?
That's really yet.

514
00:22:25,691 --> 00:22:26,530
I mean then he,
I don't know,

515
00:22:26,531 --> 00:22:28,290
he didn't test it himself.
Oh,

516
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,720
it goes up and then did research on all
those things and then did told you how

517
00:22:31,721 --> 00:22:32,890
it worked for him.
Oh,

518
00:22:32,891 --> 00:22:37,660
so did he say it worked?
Is Rhino seven work just said it's fast

519
00:22:37,661 --> 00:22:39,450
acting.
You don't have to write back items

520
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,540
today.
Okay,

521
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,780
well there are things that,
okay.

522
00:22:43,781 --> 00:22:48,010
One thing I can say is I was rock hard.
He says in all caps for like three days

523
00:22:48,011 --> 00:22:50,350
on this stuff,
which is almost kind of annoying.

524
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:54,190
It depends on imagine having a hard on
when you have to do day to day tasks,

525
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:57,220
tucking your boner into your pants and
hoping it doesn't just pop out

526
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,113
unexpectedly.

527
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,530
Yeah.
Wow.

528
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:02,290
So these things really are,
but I see,

529
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,320
I thought you were going to send me
something where the guy actually tested

530
00:23:05,321 --> 00:23:08,080
it to find out what the ingredients are.
That's what I'm interested in.

531
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:10,570
If you're gonna have fda.gov if you
could probably look up at like a couple

532
00:23:10,571 --> 00:23:13,880
of these different ones.
I don't trust the government and their

533
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:17,110
line was Bob Chem trails.
The fucking line was about Dick Pills

534
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:20,350
definitely makes you a lot hornier like,
like horny.

535
00:23:20,351 --> 00:23:24,970
I seek out massages.
I seek out like I like,

536
00:23:24,971 --> 00:23:28,620
I literally like am a hundred percent
more hornier than when I'm on these

537
00:23:28,621 --> 00:23:31,900
though.
Like almost bad almost back after you

538
00:23:31,901 --> 00:23:33,700
take them like the next day.
Do you feel like shit?

539
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,500
No.
You feel worn out now.

540
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,330
There's no,
none of that kind of affects.

541
00:23:37,331 --> 00:23:39,310
Like I don't get that spokesperson for
boner pills.

542
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,410
Oh,
I have a stake in these companies had an

543
00:23:41,411 --> 00:23:45,100
addiction to them and I spinned out of
control with why don't they fucking

544
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,310
sponsor your podcast?

545
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,930
I don't want anything to do with them
anyway.

546
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,900
Can eat sponsors.
This should,

547
00:23:50,901 --> 00:23:53,750
this should be your first sponsor.
I think on it needs to figure out what's

548
00:23:53,751 --> 00:23:56,990
in these things and make their own.
I think anovos no,

549
00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:00,590
probably not a good idea.
We know we don't want to be involved in

550
00:24:00,591 --> 00:24:03,620
any shady shit.
Doctor,

551
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,520
doctor,
Brian's boner pills.

552
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:10,580
It's side on it company.
You could say I'm not really a doctor,

553
00:24:10,581 --> 00:24:14,330
but I play one on the Internet.
It was fucking stethoscope on.

554
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:15,560
This is Dr. Ryan.
No,

555
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:20,570
I just about don't just hold onto a dead
Rhino's horn and actual we'll,

556
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,670
you know,
we can get that special effects guy,

557
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,360
that guy that did the American Werewolf
to make a rhino horn with blood at the

558
00:24:26,361 --> 00:24:28,920
bottom of it.
Like you had just chopped it off like

559
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:29,820
that.
Oh like that?

560
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:31,310
Yeah.
And on the other side make it like a

561
00:24:31,311 --> 00:24:33,230
helmet.
Like it looks like a Dick on the horn.

562
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:34,760
That'd be so offensive.
People would cry.

563
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,450
They killed a fucking

564
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,580
no,
just for their show.

565
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:44,720
Rhinos are beautiful man.
It is kind of fucked up that they get

566
00:24:44,721 --> 00:24:47,870
killed for that one specific reason for
those horns.

567
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:52,100
So weird.
So it's just so weird.

568
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,690
But you know what?
That Rhino,

569
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,790
even though it looks sad that he got his
horns chopped off,

570
00:24:55,791 --> 00:24:58,400
he's probably like,
did my face is a lot lighter now.

571
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,990
This is way better.
I don't even know.

572
00:24:59,991 --> 00:25:00,640
He's an idiot.
Yeah.

573
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,810
Look at him.
It was stupid stupid eyelashes.

574
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:03,703
He doesn't know shit.

575
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,950
But did they chop his horn off to save
him?

576
00:25:05,951 --> 00:25:08,410
Is that what they did here?
Because I know they're doing some weird

577
00:25:08,411 --> 00:25:11,620
stuff to save.
What does it say?

578
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,870
So it just made foot boundary.
Oh,

579
00:25:13,871 --> 00:25:16,060
farmed game.
Armed Gang.

580
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,880
Oh,
an armed gang reportedly broke into the

581
00:25:18,881 --> 00:25:20,230
game preserve.
Oh,

582
00:25:20,231 --> 00:25:25,231
and then cut the fucking horns off.
Stole seven rhino horns from a safe.

583
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,400
Oh,
so the photo doesn't represent,

584
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,420
does that photoshop maybe looks real
either way.

585
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:35,380
Um,
they're doing this to elephants.

586
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:39,430
They're painting their tusks pink.
They're dying.

587
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:40,930
The breast cases.
Yes.

588
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:44,080
For Awareness.
For Awareness.

589
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:49,570
Talk for a second.
Like I write something down.

590
00:25:49,571 --> 00:25:51,340
I've been forgetting and I just
remembered.

591
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,660
Oh my God.
Hold on one second.

592
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:57,330
The rhinos on these boner pills all have
their horns though.

593
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:00,690
So that's good.
There's weird that,

594
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:04,440
uh,
aunts and rhinoceroses both supposedly

595
00:26:04,441 --> 00:26:06,750
can make boners.
What?

596
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,340
Yeah,
like ants.

597
00:26:08,341 --> 00:26:11,700
Like if you grind up these African ants,
they can also make boners.

598
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,550
But Rhinoceros Horn doesn't work.
Maybe it does.

599
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:18,060
Maybe it does act.
There's so many rhinos,

600
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:18,450
oh,
hello.

601
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:19,270
Over these

602
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:22,300
side of that Chinese medicine stuff that
just doesn't do anything.

603
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,000
Some of it's got to work though.
I mean,

604
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:28,140
they were hitting mess back then when
they couldn't do testing that you had a

605
00:26:28,141 --> 00:26:29,890
real,
you had a hope that you find a guy that

606
00:26:29,891 --> 00:26:33,220
was completely legit.
A guy who really knew how to make magic

607
00:26:33,221 --> 00:26:35,830
potions.
So essentially what it was when they

608
00:26:35,831 --> 00:26:37,570
didn't have any data,
no internet,

609
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,360
no encyclopedias,
no fucking medical books to call upon

610
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,490
those,
those fucking people there.

611
00:26:42,491 --> 00:26:43,740
There's a lot of guessing going on.

612
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:48,320
Not Real.
It's not real sack of online thing that

613
00:26:48,321 --> 00:26:49,840
kind of went viral.
Oh.

614
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:53,180
But there's still some sort of
conservation effort going on,

615
00:26:53,181 --> 00:26:55,790
but the pink tusk painting isn't a real
thing.

616
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:59,140
Okay,
so was it a photoshop thing or was it a

617
00:26:59,141 --> 00:26:59,974
hoax?

618
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:03,300
Both.
The reports online regarding elephant

619
00:27:03,301 --> 00:27:06,210
Tusk being painted pink and an effort to
do value the ivory poachers.

620
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:06,831
Well,
this man,

621
00:27:06,831 --> 00:27:08,750
people would still take it.
They'd go,

622
00:27:08,751 --> 00:27:10,190
dude is a pink one,
is one.

623
00:27:10,191 --> 00:27:13,800
They tried to save site.
It's,

624
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:15,620
it is kind of fucked up,
man.

625
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,560
It's just,
it's just such a weird,

626
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:24,620
it's a weird thing that people would do
to chop off a part of an animal's face

627
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,940
to try to get their dick hard.
This is,

628
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,290
you know,
it'd be one thing if there wasn't an

629
00:27:30,291 --> 00:27:32,150
alternative.
Don't you think?

630
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:34,130
If it was really awesome,
you would have heard about it though.

631
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,051
I don't know,
man.

632
00:27:36,051 --> 00:27:38,120
I think I've,
I think it might be.

633
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,750
There might be something to it.
Okay.

634
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,170
Why don't you Google?
Can Rhino Horns really give you an

635
00:27:45,171 --> 00:27:47,330
erection?
I just put Rhino Boehner and see what he

636
00:27:47,331 --> 00:27:50,240
won't do it because it's his laptop.
I'm not getting on a list.

637
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,160
Not going to do this to me.

638
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,570
That can Rhino Horn other Stephen's show
you what?

639
00:27:54,571 --> 00:27:56,160
That says,
Ken Rhino Horn.

640
00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:00,840
Your cancer grow back regrow or what can
they be used for?

641
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,860
Well,
how about why you?

642
00:28:02,861 --> 00:28:05,290
Why you doing that?
Erectile dysfunction.

643
00:28:05,291 --> 00:28:06,460
That's what I'm looking for.
A band.

644
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,830
If it helped you with erectile
dysfunction and cancer,

645
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:13,540
why Agra and species protection?
Oh my God.

646
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,480
What was that saying?
It was speculative.

647
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,110
Yeah,
it's too small.

648
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,290
What does all speculation so far,
but the anti impotence,

649
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:21,400
drug,
Viagra,

650
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:22,361
blah,
blah,

651
00:28:22,361 --> 00:28:22,751
blah,
blah,

652
00:28:22,751 --> 00:28:25,060
blah.
This bigger penis is too,

653
00:28:25,061 --> 00:28:25,894
I guess.
Huh?

654
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,520
Tiger Penis.
That's good.

655
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,300
Viagra,
cialis or powdered raggle.

656
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:32,320
Rhino Horn.
Which one is the most effective?

657
00:28:32,321 --> 00:28:34,570
Click on that one.
Above top secret.

658
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,360
Definitely going to be legit.
If it's on above top secret,

659
00:28:37,361 --> 00:28:39,580
especially if it's an a forum.
Black helicopters.

660
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,450
Is it possible in this day and age,
21st century.

661
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:46,240
There's still men out there that
honestly believe that powdered Horn of

662
00:28:46,241 --> 00:28:48,580
an animal that has been butchered,
sometimes the arm,

663
00:28:48,581 --> 00:28:49,414
blah,
blah,

664
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,000
um,
it has had its horn removed by a

665
00:28:52,001 --> 00:28:53,770
chainsaw can still be effective.

666
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:58,450
Cure for rectal dysfunction.
Are we really still this backward?

667
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:03,160
Shouldn't the medical companies that are
the marketing meds that are marketing

668
00:29:03,161 --> 00:29:05,530
meds,
which are supposed to be temporary

669
00:29:05,531 --> 00:29:07,780
curious for this problem,
be targeting the men?

670
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,570
Mainly Oriental,
Asian racist.

671
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,840
Wow.
I'm sure who are directly responsible

672
00:29:13,841 --> 00:29:16,480
for the death of so many rhino or I
know,

673
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:20,050
isn't it the way to say it or rhinos,
but it sounds better.

674
00:29:20,051 --> 00:29:24,400
Like you're a sophisticated,
like dear so many Rhino Octopi.

675
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,880
I'm a fan of OCTOPI.
Uh,

676
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,760
I thought that most Far Eastern
countries were actually quite

677
00:29:30,761 --> 00:29:33,310
progressive,
but they themselves are proving that

678
00:29:33,311 --> 00:29:35,770
they are not exclamation point.
First of all,

679
00:29:35,771 --> 00:29:40,420
fuck phase.
There's a billion people in China alone,

680
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:44,680
one yen.
There's not that many people chopping

681
00:29:44,681 --> 00:29:47,740
off rhino horns.
If you compare them to the idiots that

682
00:29:47,741 --> 00:29:50,920
we have here in America,
just by capita.

683
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:54,430
You know the,
a number of people that are scarfing of

684
00:29:54,431 --> 00:29:57,820
Rhino Horn in Asia versus the number of
people here,

685
00:29:57,821 --> 00:30:02,140
they're chewing on bath salts is
probably way more bass.

686
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,390
All people here than Rhino Horn people.
They're like,

687
00:30:04,391 --> 00:30:07,000
that's a totally racist thing to say,
sir.

688
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:12,180
For someone who is so concerned with the
health and welfare of these Rhina Sy,

689
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,860
this guy's an idiot.
Yeah,

690
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,330
well,
he's a guy on a forum.

691
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:20,470
It's easy to be an idiot on a forum.
It's easily been in India on a podcast

692
00:30:20,471 --> 00:30:22,480
too.
It's easy to be an idiot,

693
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:25,330
you know?
But I just,

694
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,930
I don't understand why.
Like there's,

695
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,420
there seems to be like an easy cure for
that.

696
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,610
Like if you just got them some of that
gas station,

697
00:30:33,611 --> 00:30:35,530
boner pills,
they wouldn't want to have anything to

698
00:30:35,531 --> 00:30:38,200
do with a rhino horn.
The Rhino Horn is worth thousands of

699
00:30:38,201 --> 00:30:38,500
fucking,
yeah,

700
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,470
no.
Unless there is a little bit of Rhino

701
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:45,530
Horn in all these imagined calling us.
They even made a Hologram on this one.

702
00:30:45,531 --> 00:30:45,760
Yeah,

703
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,860
no shit.
Imagine if that's what it is.

704
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:49,300
Yeah.
We kind of find out,

705
00:30:49,301 --> 00:30:51,160
man.
I bet we would be the pioneer.

706
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:55,180
I'd be be the first person to actually
do a scientific test on these pills,

707
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,750
including the people that made them.
I bet they never tested shit.

708
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,460
They don't know what the fuck's in
there.

709
00:31:00,461 --> 00:31:02,050
Probably,
you know,

710
00:31:02,051 --> 00:31:04,750
when we had some of the earlier versions
of Alpha brain,

711
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:09,850
we would run these random tests on them
and we'd find out that like there would

712
00:31:09,851 --> 00:31:14,320
be like b12 in air or something like
that or creating or it wasn't creating,

713
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:17,950
it was a beat 12 I would have to ask
Aubrey,

714
00:31:17,951 --> 00:31:22,420
I'm talking about my ass,
but the bottom line was the mixers that

715
00:31:22,421 --> 00:31:24,430
they used for our stuff,
when,

716
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:27,490
when they combine all of our stuff,
they didn't clean it out,

717
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:30,070
so they had whatever was in there
before.

718
00:31:30,071 --> 00:31:32,320
Even though those just trace a trace
amount,

719
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,550
they don't give a fuck.
They just don't

720
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:39,820
shake that bag.
Talk Fart,

721
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:41,860
get on the radio,
maybe spit in there.

722
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,753
People are assholes.

723
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,670
Yeah.
It's probably done in a tent also.

724
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,540
You know,
like it's it,

725
00:31:45,541 --> 00:31:48,150
it makes pride now the lab,
it's probably a tent somewhere.

726
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,490
Where do you think they make boner pills
if you had a Pomona?

727
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:51,743
Yeah,
this is definitely,

728
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:55,050
this is fan.
Nice material.

729
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,280
And I'll take this.
Some dudes,

730
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:58,560
they have a trailer right outside the
freeway,

731
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,340
like under an underpass.
They're cooking it right in plain sight.

732
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:05,040
Right.
I just want to know the guys that sell

733
00:32:05,041 --> 00:32:08,700
these that come in to the gas stations.
Like what those guys like the salesman

734
00:32:08,701 --> 00:32:09,920
that boner pills,
no,

735
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,810
number 11 and the sunglasses on all the
time.

736
00:32:12,811 --> 00:32:16,710
You don't get to see their eyes sketchy
la looking left and looking right.

737
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:23,550
Apparently there's a big NPR piece on
this.

738
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:25,800
The other NBR people are in the getting
hard ons.

739
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:29,400
Nice.
I'm just looking down the whole article

740
00:32:29,401 --> 00:32:31,740
right now,
but it says contrary to the popular myth

741
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:35,070
and the West Rhino Horn was never
traditionally viewed as an aphrodisiac.

742
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,980
I'm finding some stuff.
They use it for all sorts of things like

743
00:32:37,981 --> 00:32:40,430
as a gift that some people think it's a
hangover

744
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:45,430
cure is valued more than gold.
Uh,

745
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,960
something like $1,400 an ounce.

746
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:51,110
Paris and gold.
Is that what you're talking about?

747
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,720
Yeah,
more than gold.

748
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,070
Yeah.

749
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:54,540
Yeah.
I'll show you.

750
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:59,170
There
is appetite for Rhino Horn drives

751
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:02,420
poaching in Africa.
This is from 2013.

752
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,430
Um,
they killed 668 rhinos in 2012.

753
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,190
I go on and talk about what they're
using to kill them and whatnot.

754
00:33:10,191 --> 00:33:11,630
And then it says how much it's worth.

755
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:16,940
Look at this smuggler.
The guy give his name sits behind Rhino

756
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:17,551
Horn.
See?

757
00:33:17,551 --> 00:33:19,560
Oh,
they were seized at the airport?

758
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,160
Yeah.

759
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:20,993
Wow.

760
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:25,750
Yeah.
There's a 60 pounds 60 pounds got caught

761
00:33:25,751 --> 00:33:29,440
being smuggled in Ho Chi Minh City.
That was worth over like one point $5

762
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:29,520
million.

763
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,500
Holy Shit.
Yeah.

764
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:34,980
They use it for a lot of things.
Apparently.

765
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:39,540
That is a crazy number.
I had no idea that six pounds worth 1

766
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,373
million bucks.

767
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,120
Okay.

768
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,760
Surveys,
30 different ailments including

769
00:33:43,761 --> 00:33:46,790
hangovers like a fad.
It became popular,

770
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:48,230
but blah,
blah ass thing to do.

771
00:33:48,231 --> 00:33:49,790
It's gift.
It's a great gift to your boss or

772
00:33:49,791 --> 00:33:51,250
government official.
A guy.

773
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,590
It's a great gift for your boss or a
government official.

774
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:57,850
That's how boy,
Fan and bull,

775
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,480
how do you say that name?
Fan.

776
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:04,190
T.
H.

777
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:04,190
A.
N.

778
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:04,190
H.
A.

779
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:09,190
Retired Tom Dawn as we think we retired
official who used to approve

780
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,450
construction projects in the Vietnamese
government.

781
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:16,630
Got his stash of Rhino Horn.
He began taking Rhino Horn to recover

782
00:34:16,701 --> 00:34:21,701
from drinking binges with contractors.
Every time I drank alcohol,

783
00:34:21,801 --> 00:34:23,810
I'd go home and grind the horn and
drink.

784
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:24,650
It says,
boy,

785
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:28,130
a 65 year old grandfather of two an hour
later,

786
00:34:28,131 --> 00:34:32,350
I'd throw up and feel sober again.
Hmm hmm.

787
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:35,630
That chick lake city has breakfast
table.

788
00:34:35,631 --> 00:34:40,631
He unwraps piece of newspaper to reveal
small grade block of Rhino Horn.

789
00:34:40,971 --> 00:34:44,360
He received as a gift.
Whoa boy.

790
00:34:44,361 --> 00:34:49,361
Paul pours water into a specially made
bowl with a rough bottom and grinds the

791
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:54,821
block of Horn into a milky white liquid.
The grinding creates an odor that smells

792
00:34:56,841 --> 00:34:59,900
like burned hair.
It's because Rhino Horn contains

793
00:34:59,901 --> 00:35:01,610
Keratin,
the main component,

794
00:35:01,611 --> 00:35:06,320
fingernails and hair.
He says that the value of Rhino Horn

795
00:35:06,321 --> 00:35:11,321
grew as the value of Rhino Horn grew.
It became a kind of currency.

796
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,620
Oh,
it's fucked.

797
00:35:12,621 --> 00:35:15,500
It's a part of their culture that's
fucked.

798
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,020
That's fucked it.
They're like trading in,

799
00:35:18,021 --> 00:35:21,590
giving it to officials and bosses,
and they'll could I have her yo.

800
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,240
Very illegal.
Right?

801
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:26,370
Why don't we just like liquor that way?
Sometimes people use it.

802
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,420
How about Cuban cigars too?
Yeah.

803
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:28,931
Yeah.
Well,

804
00:35:28,931 --> 00:35:33,810
Cuban cigars were the thing because
Cuban cigars up until really recently,

805
00:35:33,811 --> 00:35:37,290
were illegal.
We could smoke one right now and it was

806
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,790
one.
Which three of them.

807
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:42,180
Exactly.
Yeah.

808
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:46,200
Who brought these in?
A real Cubans

809
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,573
there.
Three of them.

810
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:51,320
Cohibas hits man.
Goddammit.

811
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:54,480
Who brought him to us?
I'll remember.

812
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:58,440
No,
it was or someone within the last month

813
00:35:58,441 --> 00:36:00,180
I feel like.
Was it Chris Ryan?

814
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:04,140
No,
Chris Ryan's on the new Nikki glaser

815
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:05,370
show.
Uh,

816
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:07,380
powerful.
Pretty funny on that.

817
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:11,160
That's a Chris Mcguire is the evp of
that show.

818
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:13,530
Such a good show.
Powerful Chris Mcguire.

819
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:16,800
We're here smoking a Cuban cigars.
You're allowed to smoke them now.

820
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,330
You don't what they say about Cuba,
man,

821
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,160
they say,
you got to get to Cuba now.

822
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:24,690
They'll like get there now because it's
going to turn into fucking applebee's.

823
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,890
It's going to be like,
oh,

824
00:36:25,891 --> 00:36:28,640
giant.
Six months from now it'll be Marriott

825
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:33,340
bite the end off here.
I've read something about how like we

826
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,490
are already these dried out.
They're gonna.

827
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,670
They're going to be shitty.
I heard that were like taking all their

828
00:36:38,671 --> 00:36:41,160
beverages,
like the Americans are already like

829
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:43,080
taking it.
Like other waters broke apart.

830
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,660
It broke apart.
It's dry.

831
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,870
We didn't put them in the human door.
I thought they were in these,

832
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:52,530
there's different kinds of these tubes
and some of these tubes are sealed.

833
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,600
These ones are just kind of screwed
down.

834
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:57,690
Let's say the Gar.

835
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,263
Okay.

836
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:08,600
People hear that silence.
That's a sound to me being a man smoking

837
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,010
a cigar.
Cuban by the way,

838
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,720
probably fake.
Just chewing on it.

839
00:37:11,721 --> 00:37:13,120
It's not,
I don't chew on Dude,

840
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:18,450
we can get you sick.
I chewed tobacco when I was a kid cause

841
00:37:23,061 --> 00:37:26,870
I read Tom Sawyer and huckleberry Finn,
which is now centered.

842
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,053
Okay.

843
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,720
Shoot you like on the side of your
mouth.

844
00:37:30,721 --> 00:37:32,890
Yeah.
It's a real chew like you buy a brick of

845
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:36,650
it
will be and men here,

846
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:40,830
men one turn that um,
air conditioning thing on behind you

847
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:44,370
and we'll uh,
get some,

848
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:49,760
some hot flow up in this bitch
stuff.

849
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:53,340
Um,
but we were talking,

850
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:56,160
oh yeah.
So it was a a like a brick that looked

851
00:37:56,161 --> 00:37:58,920
like maybe like a pack of gum or
something like that and you pull it

852
00:37:58,921 --> 00:38:03,750
apart and then you bite into the brick
and pull off chunks of tobacco and chew

853
00:38:03,751 --> 00:38:05,220
on it.
And I almost threw up once.

854
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:07,230
Maybe I did throw up,
but I was like,

855
00:38:07,231 --> 00:38:08,160
all right,
this is stupid.

856
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:10,710
But I got into it because of Tom Sawyer
and huckleberry Finn.

857
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:14,370
Yeah.
I never got into smoking cigars because

858
00:38:14,371 --> 00:38:16,740
I wanted in a hail it so much.
Yeah,

859
00:38:16,741 --> 00:38:18,600
but you get high as fuck off these
things.

860
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:23,610
Tobacco has some sort of psychoactive
properties to it for sure.

861
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:29,240
And I think that they use it in a lot of
IOWASCA rituals with a,

862
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:33,600
they light tobacco smoke and they blow
it in your face while you're tripping.

863
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,910
And both Aubrey and Amber Lyon when they
did it,

864
00:38:36,911 --> 00:38:39,790
we're talking about that.
It's definitely got some,

865
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:43,540
like I've smoked cigars before and got
some really good ideas where I was like,

866
00:38:43,541 --> 00:38:44,800
well,
my brain is flying.

867
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:50,350
You'd probably really like cigarettes.
I just can't wait until,

868
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:53,490
except for the whole being healthy.
Yeah,

869
00:38:53,491 --> 00:38:54,820
it probably would.
Yeah.

870
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:55,811
You know,
Eddie Bravo,

871
00:38:55,811 --> 00:38:57,160
we'll smoke a cigarette every now and
then.

872
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:58,483
I remember that thing.

873
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,510
I found that thing a couple of weeks ago
that didn't want to bring up because I

874
00:39:01,511 --> 00:39:04,030
wasn't sure if it was real,
but it said that cigarettes are like

875
00:39:04,031 --> 00:39:06,340
proven.
There was some study that was proven to

876
00:39:06,341 --> 00:39:09,070
give some sort of benefit for
creativity.

877
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:12,190
Yeah.
There was the negative of the inhaling

878
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:15,910
almost didn't even outweigh the benefit
you got from creativity.

879
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,190
Well health wise,
yeah,

880
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,100
the risk.
Yeah.

881
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:21,460
They were saying that it's like a
nootropic that it actually stimulates

882
00:39:21,461 --> 00:39:24,100
brain function.
But if that's the case then you just

883
00:39:24,101 --> 00:39:26,290
talking about the nicotine.
So,

884
00:39:26,291 --> 00:39:28,630
um,
I've done before shows,

885
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:31,510
I've sucked on those blue cigarettes.
But first of all,

886
00:39:31,511 --> 00:39:35,050
because I want to be Stephen Dorff
secretly and second of all,

887
00:39:35,051 --> 00:39:37,030
because they do give you like a little
pep,

888
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:39,970
like a cup of coffee type pep,
you know?

889
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:40,953
Yeah.
Is that is,

890
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:42,370
but that's not as strong as its
cigarette

891
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:44,600
right now.
That shit's bullshit compared to a

892
00:39:44,601 --> 00:39:46,970
cigarette like I've tried.
That's why I've tried doing like the

893
00:39:46,971 --> 00:39:49,210
vape life and all that bullshit.
But it's just a,

894
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:51,200
it's not the same.
There's just something to,

895
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,860
I should smoke a cigarette before I go
onstage.

896
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:56,120
Yeah.
Let's see if it was just one time.

897
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,993
See what it's like.

898
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:00,180
You should also have it with your
morning coffee after you eat after sex.

899
00:40:00,181 --> 00:40:03,570
You should have it with a drink while
you're driving.

900
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:07,190
The problem is
people get addicted,

901
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,780
you know,
I don't want,

902
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,210
I'm not going to do it.
Like I'm not going to get addicted to

903
00:40:11,211 --> 00:40:11,771
cigarettes.
I,

904
00:40:11,771 --> 00:40:12,604
I'll never let,
yeah,

905
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:15,140
the habit of doing it every time you had
a show and yeah,

906
00:40:15,141 --> 00:40:17,930
that could be a problem.
Even if you only smoked two cigarettes a

907
00:40:17,931 --> 00:40:20,500
weekend over the course of your life.
That's got,

908
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:21,610
that's a lot of cigarettes.
Yeah.

909
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,450
But you're old enough to do it now.
Well,

910
00:40:23,451 --> 00:40:25,700
Eddie does.
That's the only reason why I would think

911
00:40:25,701 --> 00:40:28,190
there'd be a way to do it is because
Eddie,

912
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,530
Eddie just,
we'll smoke a cigarette every now and

913
00:40:30,531 --> 00:40:33,530
again.
Like he might smoke once a month or

914
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:36,050
every two months or something like that.
And I'm like,

915
00:40:36,051 --> 00:40:37,880
wow,
and what does [inaudible] look at every

916
00:40:37,881 --> 00:40:39,320
now and then?
Every now and then we'll have one.

917
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:41,180
Like,
that's interesting.

918
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,120
Diaz used to do that for a while too,
but he doesn't do it anymore.

919
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,160
He,
I think he still does the blu cigarette

920
00:40:46,161 --> 00:40:48,530
though.
We're talking about Joey not native to

921
00:40:48,531 --> 00:40:51,700
make our nick by the way,
but um,

922
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:55,790
dses to even after he quit,
he would go outside and take a cigarette

923
00:40:55,791 --> 00:40:57,710
from you smoke one like right before a
show.

924
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,920
There's definitely some benefit in a
nicotine.

925
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:02,900
Definitely.
I just would,

926
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,440
I would wonder,
maybe I should just smoke a cigar before

927
00:41:06,441 --> 00:41:08,870
I go on stage.
Like what gives you more of a rush?

928
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:13,110
I'd say cigarettes probably better
because you're inhaling it or you're

929
00:41:13,111 --> 00:41:15,420
supposed to inhale it and it's faster.
You're not sticking up.

930
00:41:15,421 --> 00:41:17,550
The place here that's a problem with is
tanking up the place.

931
00:41:17,551 --> 00:41:19,080
First of all,
how dare I know.

932
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:19,781
I know.
I,

933
00:41:19,781 --> 00:41:21,200
I'm one of the guys that,
that,

934
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:23,820
that when they smell this,
they get immediately angry.

935
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:24,540
They're like,
okay,

936
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:27,090
who's the guy that's just fucking ruined
everybody's Day?

937
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,250
This is what we're going to do.
We're going to go,

938
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:29,380
well,

939
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:31,420
old timey men,
not,

940
00:41:31,421 --> 00:41:34,610
not like men.
The sixties and seventies were going to

941
00:41:34,611 --> 00:41:37,490
go old timey like thirties and twenties
we're going to start smoking pipes.

942
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,360
Ooh,
no man,

943
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:41,840
man.
The only reason why I didn't want to

944
00:41:41,841 --> 00:41:43,610
watch that show is because I read headed
grow,

945
00:41:43,611 --> 00:41:45,530
the buzzing me redheaded girl was just
so hot.

946
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,400
Water wash them.
I like a girl's just not afraid to put

947
00:41:49,401 --> 00:41:52,940
some pounds on tobacco.
You roll cigarettes with does that have

948
00:41:52,941 --> 00:41:54,010
a lot of nicotine?
And I was just like,

949
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:56,300
oh yeah,
a spliff like if you made it half joint,

950
00:41:56,301 --> 00:41:57,350
half those,
fuck you up,

951
00:41:57,351 --> 00:41:59,630
man.
I'd never really do spliffs.

952
00:41:59,631 --> 00:42:02,570
I'm not a spliff guy,
but when I was hanging out with Charlie

953
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:04,700
Murphy,
I did so Charlie Murphy would roll all

954
00:42:04,701 --> 00:42:07,070
of them.
So you'd be taking in the weed with the

955
00:42:07,071 --> 00:42:12,071
nicotine together.
I got higher than probably any other

956
00:42:12,201 --> 00:42:13,700
time before in my life.

957
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:17,150
Doing shows with Charlie.
Charlie Murphy is one of the coolest

958
00:42:17,151 --> 00:42:19,520
fucking guys in the world.
He really is.

959
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:23,330
I love that guy.
He's just such a good dude.

960
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:28,780
Such a solid guy and he smokes the shit
out of those blunts.

961
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:33,160
I hate what routes do that a lot of is
like the,

962
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:35,060
the blunts.
Usually it's,

963
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:38,450
I don't know why it's,
it's to me it's like a white guy smoking

964
00:42:38,451 --> 00:42:39,110
a menthol.
Got,

965
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:40,400
Oh,
you're one of those blunt girls.

966
00:42:40,401 --> 00:42:42,200
Great.
Well you dating girls that like the fuck

967
00:42:42,201 --> 00:42:43,034
part guys.
Yeah,

968
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:45,380
totally normal.
Super Common.

969
00:42:45,381 --> 00:42:48,320
I that's more of an age.
Did they say y'all a lot and get mad and

970
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,850
throw their hands around like gang
signs.

971
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:57,320
Like I could never be a cigar smoker in
my house because then you could tell

972
00:42:57,321 --> 00:42:59,600
this with just fucking get on every
smells awesome.

973
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:01,010
You like the smell.
I love it.

974
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,950
Don't know what you're talking about,
but I don't love it as much as pipes.

975
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,950
And that's what I was thinking of.
Was it a Bertrand Russell,

976
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:10,940
I think who was a,
a a a famous inveterate pipe smoker.

977
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:13,100
Tobacco addict.
Brilliant man.

978
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:15,500
And back in the day,
um,

979
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:19,040
he wouldn't fly unless he could smoke on
the plane.

980
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:20,780
He wouldn't fly.
He said.

981
00:43:20,781 --> 00:43:21,500
Yeah,
there is.

982
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,333
Yeah,
that's him.

983
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:26,000
He's got a story about a on tobacco.
Once you find,

984
00:43:26,001 --> 00:43:27,500
find the youtube clip.
Okay.

985
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:31,610
Bertrand Russell on tobacco.
Fascinating guy,

986
00:43:31,611 --> 00:43:35,990
because that guy lived in the dark ages
of information as far as the modern

987
00:43:35,991 --> 00:43:40,130
world and the world of photography and
the ability to document things.

988
00:43:40,131 --> 00:43:45,131
So to get a guy like this on a youtube
video shotos I see is like big tobacco.

989
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:48,673
What year was this?

990
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:52,120
You Bet.
Go patient by all day long.

991
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:55,260
The shipyard,
I need you most gp hasn't that shortens

992
00:43:55,261 --> 00:43:58,800
your life?
Will they do to see your night fish took

993
00:43:58,801 --> 00:44:02,420
to it?
I took two jumps 70 years ago.

994
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,070
Show that it doesn't seem to hit a vt
Greeky fake Shopha

995
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:09,740
pick.
Do you know Ryan?

996
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,200
What indication?
He saved my day

997
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:20,320
an airplane and did it getting
[inaudible].

998
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:25,410
I should get me a sheet and shocking,
but should I cannot smoke Geisha Day and

999
00:44:25,411 --> 00:44:27,550
sure enough,
that was your neck.

1000
00:44:27,551 --> 00:44:32,551
She didn't do bad accident and all the
people in the back pain would drown

1001
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:38,460
people in into smoking pot and jumped
into the Norwegian showed where we

1002
00:44:38,461 --> 00:44:41,790
landed.
Edward saved to the,

1003
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:43,110
I owe my life to smoking.

1004
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:44,850
Did you have,
did he drown?

1005
00:44:44,851 --> 00:44:49,050
All the people
playing crash,

1006
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:54,380
crazy sacrifice that story.
He's a plane crash bro.

1007
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:58,030
That's crazy.
So all the people that you see,

1008
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:01,800
there's a real ashtray that somewhere
this seems like one of those stories

1009
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,350
that everyone was like,
oh is that true?

1010
00:45:04,351 --> 00:45:07,410
But there was no internet back then so
we all just believed this guy.

1011
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:09,300
I think there probably wouldn't have
been a plane accident,

1012
00:45:09,301 --> 00:45:11,400
you know?
And he probably made this shit up and

1013
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:13,740
just cause he's old,
he's got a British accent or whatever,

1014
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:17,280
like of liars got together and you know
the had like liar conventions.

1015
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:19,440
Like the years that the internet came
out,

1016
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:20,310
they'd be like,
boys,

1017
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:22,680
we've got some problems.
We got some problems on the horizon.

1018
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:24,360
We've got to figure out where to live
better.

1019
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,880
This is how you got to cover your
tracks.

1020
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:30,660
Like liars.
They used to be super common to be

1021
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:33,750
completely full of Shit,
particularly about your martial arts

1022
00:45:33,751 --> 00:45:36,850
background.
There was a lot of really crazy people

1023
00:45:36,851 --> 00:45:41,130
when I was a kid that will like claim in
martial arts master and they would walk

1024
00:45:41,131 --> 00:45:44,730
around with like Chinese Kung Fu outfits
on and shit and slippers.

1025
00:45:44,731 --> 00:45:48,060
They're walk around with those Ninja
shoes where they had the toe that was

1026
00:45:48,061 --> 00:45:49,830
split.
You ever seen those shoes?

1027
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,600
I've seen dudes walk around with Kung Fu
outfits and did represent two completely

1028
00:45:54,601 --> 00:45:57,720
different countries.
The Kung Fu outfit is from Japan.

1029
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:00,150
The Ninjas slippers or from Japan?
They,

1030
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:03,210
the Kung Fu output is from China rather
than Ninja outfit is from Japan.

1031
00:46:03,211 --> 00:46:07,800
These motherfuckers would mix and match
the different styles of train killer.

1032
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:13,090
That guy isn't a good example though.
Like how back then you'd be like,

1033
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:16,900
so every single person died in the
nonsmoking like every single one,

1034
00:46:16,901 --> 00:46:19,180
every like there was a line where it
said no smoking.

1035
00:46:19,181 --> 00:46:20,590
All those people died.
Well,

1036
00:46:20,591 --> 00:46:22,320
the front of the plane,
we'll all see you

1037
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:26,590
think of when you're watching a guy like
Bertrand Russell.

1038
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:28,180
How what?
When did,

1039
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:32,980
when was that film did say if he was
talking about how it saved his life,

1040
00:46:32,981 --> 00:46:37,060
that had to be before they made that
shitty ass old grainy movie,

1041
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:41,440
which was in black and white.
So it was probably a long fucking time

1042
00:46:41,441 --> 00:46:45,880
ago when planes were made out of fucking
gum wrappers is when he died.

1043
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:47,410
That's when that interview was.
Okay,

1044
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:52,390
so if it's in 59 then the plane was
probably from the forties or fifties I

1045
00:46:52,391 --> 00:46:53,650
mean,
who knows when that happened,

1046
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,350
but yeah,
that ain't

1047
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:57,400
good.
That's just mad denial and wanting an

1048
00:46:57,401 --> 00:46:58,820
excuse for smoking.
Yeah.

1049
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:00,180
Yeah.
I say my live,

1050
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:04,970
I smokes a pipe.
Dope pipe is definitely a different

1051
00:47:04,971 --> 00:47:06,830
animal.
Like my grandfather used to smoke and he

1052
00:47:06,831 --> 00:47:08,840
used to have those big,
back in the day they used to have,

1053
00:47:08,841 --> 00:47:11,480
there's big lighters that would sit on
your desk and it was just like,

1054
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:15,620
oh yeah,
huge cloth wrap around the bottom of it.

1055
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:16,910
Yeah,
I remember those.

1056
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,440
This is the incident he was in.
Oh,

1057
00:47:19,441 --> 00:47:21,210
it was real.
In bursts.

1058
00:47:21,211 --> 00:47:24,660
Disaster it a crash for flying boat of
what?

1059
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,230
A what?
A flying boat house.

1060
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:31,360
Why didn't you mentioned that Birch
flying bus survivors.

1061
00:47:31,361 --> 00:47:34,170
We're all in the smoking compartment at
the back of the cabin.

1062
00:47:34,171 --> 00:47:35,200
It's true.
Damn.

1063
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:37,330
Among the survivors.
Will the philosopher,

1064
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:40,300
Bertrand Russell,
wikipedia citation needed look a fee we

1065
00:47:40,301 --> 00:47:41,560
could puffy da's.
Awesome.

1066
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,080
Although it does say I'm five,
nine and brian cows,

1067
00:47:44,081 --> 00:47:46,750
my brother,
I don't know why.

1068
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:48,940
Maybe he added that Brian?
No,

1069
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,070
I think as in my,
um,

1070
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:52,690
one of the things,
oh,

1071
00:47:52,691 --> 00:47:53,690
a shiny yet.
Nope,

1072
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:54,790
not shiny.
Happy Jihad.

1073
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:58,270
I'm going to be dead someday.
The sketch that Brian Count and I did in

1074
00:47:58,271 --> 00:48:00,850
my parents' basement where we're banging
each other,

1075
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:02,260
we're working out,
we're getting pumped.

1076
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,440
I think what,
how that whole thing started is because

1077
00:48:05,441 --> 00:48:09,430
you used to say he's your brother from
another mother and some idiot was like,

1078
00:48:09,431 --> 00:48:10,360
oh,
they're brothers.

1079
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:13,480
Well maybe it's just for fun.
And people did any,

1080
00:48:13,481 --> 00:48:15,850
looks like my brother,
he totally looks like he'd be my

1081
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:17,440
brother.
Like we just grew in different

1082
00:48:17,441 --> 00:48:19,770
directions.
He went north and south and I went east

1083
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:24,680
and West
can be stretched his face out and he

1084
00:48:24,681 --> 00:48:25,920
stretched his shoulders out.
It's,

1085
00:48:25,921 --> 00:48:29,200
it's very similar in a lot of ways,
but he's um,

1086
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,990
might as well be my brother.
But uh,

1087
00:48:31,991 --> 00:48:33,830
yeah,
wikipedia is wrong about a lot of shit.

1088
00:48:33,831 --> 00:48:35,860
It says I have crones disease to at
least it used to,

1089
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:38,980
which I don't word that even start for
him.

1090
00:48:38,981 --> 00:48:40,180
That's funny.
I'm going to be in funny,

1091
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:42,730
so I'm being silly.
I didn't want to change any of it.

1092
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:47,200
I think it's funny.
I like what the Internet does for the

1093
00:48:47,201 --> 00:48:49,870
most part.
I think a little bit of disinformation

1094
00:48:49,871 --> 00:48:50,980
makes a little p.
People go,

1095
00:48:50,981 --> 00:48:51,310
what?

1096
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:52,360
Wait,
are you serious?

1097
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:55,630
I like that.
Like even when those stupid stories come

1098
00:48:55,631 --> 00:48:56,860
out,
like I killed them out in line with a

1099
00:48:56,861 --> 00:48:59,230
belt.
My own sister called me up,

1100
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:01,270
my own fucking sisters.
Like,

1101
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:02,061
was that true?
I go,

1102
00:49:02,061 --> 00:49:04,330
what are you talking about?
You can't kill a mountain line with a

1103
00:49:04,331 --> 00:49:05,950
bell like you don't.
You don't think I'd call you?

1104
00:49:05,951 --> 00:49:07,390
If I did,
I'd be like,

1105
00:49:07,391 --> 00:49:10,420
strap yourself in sister.
Cause your brother's a fucking

1106
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,590
killed him.
Outline with a pal.

1107
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:17,410
Oh my God.
What a fucking mount mine with a belt.

1108
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:20,440
I'm about to go do a news story.
I'll call you back with it.

1109
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:24,010
It'd be strutting around in my underwear
with scars all over my body.

1110
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:28,240
I'd have all the gauze like with the
blood oozing through all the stitches,

1111
00:49:28,241 --> 00:49:32,290
which I would be fucking covered with.
Cause even if you survive a mountain

1112
00:49:32,291 --> 00:49:34,630
lion attack,
you need to fire then unscathed.

1113
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:39,660
If you go to guy's code on Instagram,
guys code on Instagram is an excellent,

1114
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:43,690
a little instagram page that has a lot
of pictures of girls butts.

1115
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:46,240
Oh um,
but the great butts,

1116
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:48,400
like you look at their assets and go,
good Lord,

1117
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:50,980
why is it so appealing to look at?
You know,

1118
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:53,020
even if someone knows he's never going
to get near that girl,

1119
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:55,990
Ma much less be able to squeeze it from
behind.

1120
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,960
Did you want to?
And so it's worth looking at like it

1121
00:49:58,961 --> 00:50:01,180
gives you that little ooh.
So they're providing you with a little

1122
00:50:01,181 --> 00:50:03,370
pleasure when they show you their acids
and those pictures,

1123
00:50:03,371 --> 00:50:05,350
those,
those wonderful gals of the instagram.

1124
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:10,270
But I'm guys code had this picture of
this guy who was like in the 18 hundreds

1125
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:14,980
killed a leopard with his bare hands.
He got attacked by a leopard in Africa

1126
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,640
and it wasn't a giant one,
but it was big enough to fuck you up

1127
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:19,240
man.

1128
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:23,020
And he was all wrapped up and stitches,
but the thing was dead next to him and

1129
00:50:23,021 --> 00:50:24,220
his arms in a slang.
I mean,

1130
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:27,680
he's fucked up.
And when you got fucked up back then you

1131
00:50:27,681 --> 00:50:30,210
got fucked up for keeps like they didn't
fix it.

1132
00:50:30,211 --> 00:50:34,280
There was no stem cells.
They didn't have acl surgery.

1133
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:38,390
I mean I would literally be crippled.
Both of my knees would be completely

1134
00:50:38,391 --> 00:50:40,400
shot cause I had,
there's the guy,

1135
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:42,710
what's his name?
Carl Eight Glee,

1136
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:45,050
a k e.
L.

1137
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:45,051
E.
Y.

1138
00:50:45,051 --> 00:50:48,890
And they have them down there as bad ass
of the week and it's got a leopard.

1139
00:50:48,891 --> 00:50:50,510
That shit.
How much you think that weighs?

1140
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:52,420
I don't know,
but it's like 60 pounds.

1141
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:55,340
Get enough to seem like it could be a
little bit dangerous,

1142
00:50:55,341 --> 00:50:57,080
but it also,
it looks like you could kind of kill

1143
00:50:57,081 --> 00:50:58,160
that.
It just would suck.

1144
00:50:58,161 --> 00:51:00,490
Like I have to pray to his poor cats
snack Mahmood.

1145
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:02,660
That thing would kill you.
Yeah.

1146
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:04,700
Fuck yeah.
Are you kidding me?

1147
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:06,950
Just think of,
I think he'd probably kill me.

1148
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:09,800
I mean,
I think that guy probably got real

1149
00:51:09,801 --> 00:51:12,590
lucky.
The cat was probably sick,

1150
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:15,200
which is why I was trying to attack and
kill a person the first place.

1151
00:51:15,201 --> 00:51:16,850
I mean that that does happen.
They get sick,

1152
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,140
they get old,
they,

1153
00:51:18,141 --> 00:51:20,360
uh,
sometimes their teeth get worn out and

1154
00:51:20,361 --> 00:51:24,050
they can't kill something big anymore.
So that's one of the problems with

1155
00:51:24,051 --> 00:51:25,540
certain animals.
When they,

1156
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:28,010
their predators,
they start picking on people because

1157
00:51:28,011 --> 00:51:31,660
they can't get animals anymore and
people are so goddamn slow.

1158
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:36,320
So what'd he say?
I felt no pain,

1159
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:39,560
but I certainly never thought for a
moment that I would come out alive.

1160
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:43,820
I was rather calm as a matter of fact,
except for a tremendous and wildly

1161
00:51:43,821 --> 00:51:47,390
pleasant thrill.
I felt knowing that I was battling for

1162
00:51:47,391 --> 00:51:49,970
my life.
What a fucking man.

1163
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:53,720
What a man.
That's why he survived.

1164
00:51:53,721 --> 00:51:54,680
What year was this?

1165
00:51:56,230 --> 00:52:01,230
What does it say it say?
It doesn't say what a fucking

1166
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:06,070
1864 64 and an eight.
Oh,

1167
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,390
he fought an elephant to,
he got pinned by an elephant.

1168
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:09,360
Okay.
It might be a dick.

1169
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:11,600
Yeah,
it's probably got slammed on the animal

1170
00:52:11,601 --> 00:52:15,220
side.
The fucking crocodile hunter overs day.

1171
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:19,580
Just threatening animals.
Or you might,

1172
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:21,650
you know,
if you're in Africa for a long enough

1173
00:52:21,651 --> 00:52:23,120
time,
you probably get jacked.

1174
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:25,760
So he was born in 1865.
So how old do you think it wasn't?

1175
00:52:25,761 --> 00:52:27,860
That picture would probably 30 right?
Yeah.

1176
00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:28,641
Scroll up,
Jamie.

1177
00:52:28,641 --> 00:52:29,474
Let me get a look at them

1178
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:33,130
all the way up.
There you go.

1179
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:35,180
They're,
it's like Kyle Kinane.

1180
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,073
Yeah,

1181
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:43,800
that's a hard drinking.
35 that's the pens that lap that Lebron

1182
00:52:43,801 --> 00:52:45,630
would fuck you up with.
Fuck me up.

1183
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:47,190
If we had it in the studio,
you know,

1184
00:52:47,191 --> 00:52:48,150
terrified.
We'd be,

1185
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:48,991
oh,
it'd be terrified.

1186
00:52:48,991 --> 00:52:52,080
But then once you grab it,
you seem like you could just like fall

1187
00:52:52,081 --> 00:52:54,960
on its head out of your mind.
You're out of your mind.

1188
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:57,460
If you ever held on to a cat,
the ones that get away,

1189
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:58,610
you have,
you have cats deck.

1190
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:00,690
You ever wash your cat?
Yeah.

1191
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:01,560
Yeah.
I know.

1192
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:04,500
They tried to kick and fucking twist and
they get mad at you.

1193
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:07,050
Pure muscle.
You know I have two of the sweetest cats

1194
00:53:07,051 --> 00:53:08,760
in the world until you try to give them
a bath,

1195
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:11,310
those little fuckers want to go to war
with you.

1196
00:53:11,370 --> 00:53:12,450
I'm like,
settle down.

1197
00:53:12,451 --> 00:53:13,770
We're just getting wet.
Right?

1198
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:18,800
Settle down.
Wash yourself,

1199
00:53:19,201 --> 00:53:20,550
bitch.
You got a dirty ass.

1200
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:24,270
Especially when they're fluffy.
Fluffy cats come out of the litter box

1201
00:53:24,271 --> 00:53:27,410
where the eco hanging off their asshole.
This is,

1202
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:30,180
they can't clean it.
It's not supposed to exist in nature.

1203
00:53:30,181 --> 00:53:33,690
He never supposed to have an asshole
with all these feathers all around it.

1204
00:53:33,691 --> 00:53:35,880
They can catch shit.
What do you got there,

1205
00:53:35,881 --> 00:53:36,714
Jamie for us?

1206
00:53:36,770 --> 00:53:39,350
See his,
the Ackley or hour,

1207
00:53:39,351 --> 00:53:43,410
he say his last name,
Hall of African Mammals in the American

1208
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:44,790
Museum of Natural History in Manhattan
is upper west side.

1209
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:46,210
So what was he,
was he,

1210
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:50,460
he was like some sort of conservation as
hunter back in the time of like

1211
00:53:50,461 --> 00:53:52,500
Roosevelt,
I'm looking through this article.

1212
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:54,930
There's another guy,
it seems like he was head to head with

1213
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:57,840
sort of like a Tesla Edison thing.
There's guy named award.

1214
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:01,650
So they were going around searching and
hunting for animals and finding new

1215
00:54:01,651 --> 00:54:04,140
species of things and different in the
Congo.

1216
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:04,360
Oh

1217
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,190
Wow.
Sorts of different places like that.

1218
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:09,850
I was watching this program on Buffalo,
um,

1219
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:14,530
last night and uh,
they were talking about how the buffalo

1220
00:54:14,531 --> 00:54:16,420
were decimated and how,
um,

1221
00:54:16,510 --> 00:54:21,510
they were shipping these truckloads or a
trains train carriage is filled with

1222
00:54:21,731 --> 00:54:26,410
buffalo meat back to the east coast.
Buffalo meat became high in demand and

1223
00:54:26,411 --> 00:54:30,580
then buffalo hides were high in demand
and they were showing in this,

1224
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:35,640
this thing that I was watching stacks of
skins just stacks of skins and of

1225
00:54:38,081 --> 00:54:39,790
skulls.
And you just look at her like,

1226
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:42,070
what the F,
how did you do this?

1227
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:44,950
How did you guys not think that this was
a terrible idea?

1228
00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:47,530
Look at that.
We get those stacks of skulls.

1229
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:51,430
This is stacks that go all the way up to
the top of that railroad cart.

1230
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,800
I mean,
that's fucking bananas.

1231
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:56,830
Stacks of skins.
Look at these skins.

1232
00:54:57,220 --> 00:55:01,390
I mean,
they would just wiping out hundreds of

1233
00:55:01,390 --> 00:55:03,940
thousands of them.
Like how many did they wipe out a year?

1234
00:55:03,941 --> 00:55:08,941
Because you got to assume like that
stuff is probably recently come off the

1235
00:55:08,981 --> 00:55:12,460
animal that says it's 40,000 buffalo
hides right there.

1236
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:16,210
Oh my God,
it's so crazy what they did.

1237
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:19,090
They're going to get this guy on the
podcast.

1238
00:55:19,091 --> 00:55:22,180
His name's Dan Flores and I found out
about them from Steve Rinella and he has

1239
00:55:22,181 --> 00:55:24,700
a very interesting hypothesis or,
well,

1240
00:55:24,701 --> 00:55:26,710
he's a scientist so,
um,

1241
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:29,440
he has an a and a historian I believe as
well.

1242
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:32,620
So he has maybe not a scientist either
way.

1243
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:37,900
His take on what happened with the
buffalo is essentially my butcher,

1244
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:41,650
this,
but that when the first Europeans came

1245
00:55:41,651 --> 00:55:45,550
to North America,
they didn't find evidence of Buffalo.

1246
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:48,040
They talked about everything else.
He talked about bear,

1247
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,500
they talked about deer,
they talked about elk,

1248
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:52,930
they talked about all these different
animals that we know exist here,

1249
00:55:52,931 --> 00:55:55,870
but they didn't really talk about
buffalo and the,

1250
00:55:55,871 --> 00:56:00,871
he believes that with the sheer numbers
of buffalo that that existed a hundred

1251
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:01,570
years later.

1252
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:04,960
It seems highly improbable that they
wouldn't talk about him.

1253
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:10,260
And his take is that what happened was
when Europeans started showing up in

1254
00:56:10,301 --> 00:56:13,090
America,
they brought with them a lot of diseases

1255
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:17,740
and those diseases that they gave these
people these like first of all,

1256
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:21,490
like there's a,
there's a common myth apparently that

1257
00:56:21,491 --> 00:56:26,491
they gave them syphilis in the form of
scabs in blankets and they put scabs and

1258
00:56:26,561 --> 00:56:28,150
blankets and game to the native
Americans.

1259
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,860
As far as I know that's not true.
Not only that,

1260
00:56:32,861 --> 00:56:37,861
they didn't know about bacteria then.
They didn't know what that you know that

1261
00:56:38,111 --> 00:56:39,730
you would,
that's how it was spread.

1262
00:56:39,731 --> 00:56:42,370
They didn't know that you would give
someone a scab and that the actual

1263
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:45,250
tissue from the scab would cause the
disease.

1264
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:49,690
The knowledge of like how diseases were
spread was not that sophisticated back

1265
00:56:49,691 --> 00:56:51,220
then as far as what I read.

1266
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:55,420
But what he's saying is that when the
Europeans came here and they introduced

1267
00:56:55,421 --> 00:56:59,410
these new diseases that they had,
that the natives didn't have any immune

1268
00:56:59,411 --> 00:57:03,130
systems for,
it fucking devastated the population and

1269
00:57:03,131 --> 00:57:06,850
he said that that is responsible for as
many deaths as anything else to the

1270
00:57:06,851 --> 00:57:10,720
native Americans that lived here.
They just got fucking completely wiped

1271
00:57:10,721 --> 00:57:14,200
out by European diseases.
When that happened,

1272
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:18,630
the native Americans were responsible
for keeping the buffalo populations and

1273
00:57:18,631 --> 00:57:21,760
check and had been doing so pretty
efficiently.

1274
00:57:21,761 --> 00:57:26,260
Ever since that the horse was brought to
North America because before the

1275
00:57:26,261 --> 00:57:29,230
Europeans came here,
native Americans didn't have horses.

1276
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:32,380
They were on horses.
So the horses that,

1277
00:57:32,381 --> 00:57:33,910
you know,
we depict the wild west,

1278
00:57:33,911 --> 00:57:36,610
that native Americans rider on the horse
and how they've always been,

1279
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:37,690
no,
no.

1280
00:57:37,691 --> 00:57:39,850
They were always like,
you know,

1281
00:57:39,851 --> 00:57:43,540
like really nomadic people that live in
Brazil or something like that in the

1282
00:57:43,541 --> 00:57:45,760
rain forest or Ecuador or something like
that.

1283
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:49,630
They weren't on horses.
So they got the horses from the North

1284
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:51,670
Americans,
but they also got the diseases and while

1285
00:57:51,671 --> 00:57:54,460
they hand the horses,
they were on the way to,

1286
00:57:54,461 --> 00:57:58,450
in his words,
extra painting the buffalo from their

1287
00:57:58,451 --> 00:58:01,240
domain,
which means it local extinction.

1288
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:04,660
So they were already doing such an
efficient job of killing the buffalo

1289
00:58:04,661 --> 00:58:08,740
from horses because they'd run up on
horses and just fucking Arrow the shit

1290
00:58:08,741 --> 00:58:11,530
out of these buffalo.
And they were ruthlessly effective cause

1291
00:58:11,531 --> 00:58:13,990
they were on a horse.
So they could get that horse right up at

1292
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:17,560
the buffalo because of Buffalo's full
clip is about 40 miles an hour.

1293
00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:19,750
But a horse can run about 50,
60,

1294
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:22,480
you know,
and especially like a really strong

1295
00:58:22,481 --> 00:58:25,870
wars.
So these guys would just run up on these

1296
00:58:25,871 --> 00:58:28,660
fucking herds of buffalo and blast them
with arrows and kill them.

1297
00:58:28,661 --> 00:58:31,810
And then they got guns and once they got
guns,

1298
00:58:31,811 --> 00:58:34,480
good googly Mowgli between horses and
rifles.

1299
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,310
I mean they were fucking these buffalo
up.

1300
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:41,080
So what happened was they got almost
wiped out and the buffalo came back

1301
00:58:41,081 --> 00:58:44,380
strong.
So when they saw these millions of

1302
00:58:44,381 --> 00:58:46,930
buffalo out on these,
these prairies,

1303
00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:51,910
that was an over abundance,
that was a rare cycle in time that

1304
00:58:51,911 --> 00:58:54,280
corresponded with the death of the
native Americans.

1305
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:55,690
And this is his,
um,

1306
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:59,800
his paper that he wrote,
Buffalo Ecology,

1307
00:58:59,801 --> 00:59:03,520
I think something something Buffalo
ecologies name is Dan Flores.

1308
00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:05,980
See if we could find it.
I think it's one of those university

1309
00:59:05,981 --> 00:59:08,740
papers though,
that you probably have to have a some

1310
00:59:08,741 --> 00:59:12,220
sort of a membership and it's like one
of those things that that kid got in

1311
00:59:12,221 --> 00:59:16,330
trouble for releasing for free or that
kid that wound up killing himself.

1312
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:19,240
Yeah,
pdf or you can get others a pdf,

1313
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:22,790
what does it say?
Bison and bison diplomacy.

1314
00:59:22,791 --> 00:59:27,200
That's it.
The southern plains from 1800 to 1850

1315
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:30,080
really,
really interesting stuff because you

1316
00:59:30,081 --> 00:59:32,210
know,
we're finding out more and more about

1317
00:59:32,211 --> 00:59:35,690
the history of this country obviously
because we still have Columbus Day.

1318
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:39,260
I mean the fact that we still have a day
named after guy who didn't even get

1319
00:59:39,261 --> 00:59:41,480
here.
You know he landed in the West indies,

1320
00:59:41,481 --> 00:59:43,370
right?
Isn't that where he landed in The

1321
00:59:43,370 --> 00:59:45,350
Bahamas or some shit?
Whether things do you think are on the

1322
00:59:45,351 --> 00:59:47,300
way out and Columbus Day is definitely
on the way.

1323
00:59:47,301 --> 00:59:49,400
It should have been out a long time.
He's a murderer.

1324
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:52,190
What else?
Columbus as a mass murderer.

1325
00:59:52,310 --> 00:59:57,230
If you go to collage to the,
there was a missionary or someone that

1326
00:59:57,231 --> 01:00:01,700
was there at the time of Columbus that
detailed the horrors of what they did to

1327
01:00:01,701 --> 01:00:03,440
the native American people that they
found,

1328
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,510
which to try to get these people to give
them gold.

1329
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:10,760
I mean the fucking whores.
They would cut off body parts and send

1330
01:00:10,761 --> 01:00:12,800
these people out.
They would cut their arms off if they

1331
01:00:12,801 --> 01:00:15,310
didn't bring back a certain amount of
weight and gold,

1332
01:00:15,311 --> 01:00:17,690
they would smash babies on the rocks.

1333
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:20,180
They would take their children from them
and smash them in the rocks.

1334
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:25,380
We were talking about boat boats filled
with serial killers and we have,

1335
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:31,330
we have a holiday or kids get off school
for a guy who ran a boat of serial

1336
01:00:31,431 --> 01:00:36,431
killers that came across the ocean and
just laid waste to everybody in front of

1337
01:00:36,711 --> 01:00:38,450
them.
I'm from a city that's named after him,

1338
01:00:38,451 --> 01:00:41,450
Columbus.
We even have his boat,

1339
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:43,550
like a recreation of his boat in
Columbus,

1340
01:00:43,551 --> 01:00:44,870
Ohio.
Fucking crazy,

1341
01:00:44,871 --> 01:00:45,681
man.
Where's that?

1342
01:00:45,681 --> 01:00:48,180
A lighter brother.
He's got it said,

1343
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,420
you know,
sparked that backups.

1344
01:00:50,450 --> 01:00:52,460
Yeah,
I'm high as fuck office.

1345
01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:54,890
The wheat,
the wheat helps.

1346
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:57,020
But um,
uh,

1347
01:00:57,021 --> 01:01:00,200
I dunno how we got on this bisons I was
watching the buffalo blah,

1348
01:01:00,201 --> 01:01:02,300
blah blah.
We're talking about Dick's and it just

1349
01:01:02,301 --> 01:01:05,900
went from Rhinos to oh yeah.
That dude,

1350
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:08,310
um,
that I posted yesterday was at cjw

1351
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:09,800
underscore photography.

1352
01:01:09,830 --> 01:01:13,850
That guy's a instagram page.
He got ahold of me and he's making that

1353
01:01:13,851 --> 01:01:17,840
wolf the wolf with the snow.
He's going to put down a steel plate and

1354
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:19,370
send it to us.
We're going to put it up here.

1355
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:22,160
Oh,
so most metal prints of bad ass.

1356
01:01:22,190 --> 01:01:24,200
Yeah.
And that was like one of the most dope

1357
01:01:24,201 --> 01:01:26,370
nature photographs ever.
Have you seen it Brian?

1358
01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:27,870
Pull it up.
It's a,

1359
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:30,230
on my instagram page is the one that was
specific.

1360
01:01:30,231 --> 01:01:34,940
It's got this wolf and his face is
covered in snow and he's looking at you,

1361
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:38,180
not the one that we showed John Dudley,
my friend John who on here yesterday.

1362
01:01:38,181 --> 01:01:41,120
Dude.
He fought a pack of wolves off.

1363
01:01:41,121 --> 01:01:43,100
It was trying to take his elk.
Whoa.

1364
01:01:43,310 --> 01:01:44,330
Yeah.
Whoa.

1365
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:46,910
Barefoot.
Like what do you do to two guides to

1366
01:01:46,911 --> 01:01:50,510
barefoot only as asshole.
That's it's how do we find them?

1367
01:01:50,570 --> 01:01:53,930
How has his feet,
he was in Alberta,

1368
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:58,340
he shot an elk in these wolves,
started circling and they ran in and

1369
01:01:58,341 --> 01:02:01,730
they were trying to scare him off the
elk and he shot one and then the other

1370
01:02:01,731 --> 01:02:05,630
wolves showed up and he started howling
and circling them that fucking picture.

1371
01:02:05,631 --> 01:02:09,200
It's how dope is that picture.
God Damn.

1372
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,570
I want to,
he's going to come to the shows,

1373
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:15,080
one of the shows at the fillmore in San
Francisco and a,

1374
01:02:15,081 --> 01:02:18,440
I want to talk to them and find out how
he took this and where was he got to be

1375
01:02:18,441 --> 01:02:20,130
created.
It's got to take lots of hours

1376
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:23,070
of sitting and waiting and camping and
being really cold.

1377
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:25,650
Yeah.
And to get this perfect shot.

1378
01:02:26,010 --> 01:02:27,660
God,
what a cool animal.

1379
01:02:27,790 --> 01:02:28,180
Hmm.

1380
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:30,340
I bet he's got some crazy stories of
getting them,

1381
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:32,500
uh,
and just being surrounded by wolves and

1382
01:02:32,501 --> 01:02:34,210
whatnot because he's got a lot of cool
pictures.

1383
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:35,230
Yeah.
You gotta be,

1384
01:02:35,290 --> 01:02:38,380
you gotta put yourself in a weird spot
to be a bold motherfucker to get that

1385
01:02:38,381 --> 01:02:39,490
photo.
I mean,

1386
01:02:39,491 --> 01:02:41,470
cause you can only be so far away,
right?

1387
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:42,230
Yeah.
Yeah.

1388
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:43,280
Your lenses can only take you.
So

1389
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:46,110
like how,
how close would you be able to like

1390
01:02:46,111 --> 01:02:46,930
that's so

1391
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:49,030
it could be cried so it could be a
little bit off,

1392
01:02:49,031 --> 01:02:52,410
but it's such a really close picture.
I bet he had a really good like 400 to

1393
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:53,650
600 Lens,
so,

1394
01:02:53,710 --> 01:02:57,600
oh my God.
Maybe 50 to 100 yards at the Oregon Zoo.

1395
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:58,760
A hundred yards.
Yeah,

1396
01:02:59,830 --> 01:03:01,180
I doubt it.
But like 50 yards.

1397
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:02,440
Yeah.
It's hard.

1398
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:04,120
I would imagine he'd be close to the
ground.

1399
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:07,240
I'm just going to be crazy.
It depends what camera you use to.

1400
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:09,420
Um,
if you go to see it,

1401
01:03:09,430 --> 01:03:10,263
go to his,
um,

1402
01:03:10,270 --> 01:03:13,120
his instagram,
there's a picture of that wolf with

1403
01:03:13,121 --> 01:03:15,730
another wolf there.
That's sweet.

1404
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,140
Yeah.
He's got a pawnshop hopcat.

1405
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:17,921
Dope Shit.
Yeah,

1406
01:03:17,921 --> 01:03:20,470
that's a bobcat.
I think we're links one of those.

1407
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:22,260
Sweet,
well those mountain lions,

1408
01:03:22,261 --> 01:03:24,340
it's got to look at that one.
Licking his lips is a gene Simmons

1409
01:03:24,341 --> 01:03:29,341
mountain mine make it up.
What do you think about Gene Simmons and

1410
01:03:29,561 --> 01:03:34,270
that whole controversy about what
controversial am calling out Nwa saying

1411
01:03:34,271 --> 01:03:38,050
they shouldn't be allowed in the rock
and roll hall of fame because he said

1412
01:03:38,051 --> 01:03:40,390
that rock and roll.
Um,

1413
01:03:40,510 --> 01:03:42,850
well kiss wasn't in the rock and roll
hall of fame forever.

1414
01:03:43,150 --> 01:03:44,440
So if I was him,
I'd be like,

1415
01:03:44,441 --> 01:03:48,130
fuck the rock and roll hall of fame.
Fame is more of like a pop pop music,

1416
01:03:48,131 --> 01:03:49,890
popular Music Hall of fame.
There's a goal.

1417
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:51,490
That shit down the pharmacy.
That wolf.

1418
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:54,070
Yeah.
Um,

1419
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:55,810
the beastie boys are kind of rock
though.

1420
01:03:55,811 --> 01:03:57,370
If you listen to Paul's Boutique,
that's the end.

1421
01:03:58,050 --> 01:03:59,500
That's it.
We'll scroll up then.

1422
01:03:59,890 --> 01:04:03,550
Paul's Boutique Dude is,
is a rock and roll album or an,

1423
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:04,773
I mean,
I don't know what,

1424
01:04:04,990 --> 01:04:06,000
how is that it?
Oh No,

1425
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:07,480
maybe he's got another page.
No,

1426
01:04:07,481 --> 01:04:08,320
man.
That's it.

1427
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:10,100
Okay.

1428
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:10,731
Are you sure?
Yeah.

1429
01:04:10,731 --> 01:04:12,480
He's got 353 posts.
Yeah.

1430
01:04:12,490 --> 01:04:15,210
That's not at Jamie refreshing.
It doesn't say no.

1431
01:04:15,211 --> 01:04:16,730
It's just not refreshing.
Just refresh it.

1432
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:18,553
Oh,
there it goes.

1433
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:20,451
Oh,
looking at raccoon.

1434
01:04:20,451 --> 01:04:21,840
That's great.
Erections are not,

1435
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:23,360
yeah,
he's got great photos.

1436
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:24,141
Oh,
amazing.

1437
01:04:24,141 --> 01:04:25,040
Man.
No,

1438
01:04:25,041 --> 01:04:26,390
that's not at Jamie.
There's,

1439
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:29,420
there's one scroll down to the exact
same pose that wolf,

1440
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:31,600
but he's with another wolf.
Why?

1441
01:04:31,790 --> 01:04:32,623
Oh,
there it goes.

1442
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:34,510
It's weird how it loads.
Right.

1443
01:04:34,790 --> 01:04:36,380
And then it's not loading up though.

1444
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:38,680
God Damn instagram.
You know what it is?

1445
01:04:38,681 --> 01:04:41,710
They went up to 62nd videos and their
shit's getting hammered.

1446
01:04:41,830 --> 01:04:43,400
Yeah.
Hammer time.

1447
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:46,150
Um,
there's another thing that I posted.

1448
01:04:46,151 --> 01:04:49,180
There it is right there.
There's another thing that I posted that

1449
01:04:49,181 --> 01:04:51,970
is the exact same wolf,
but with another wolf next to him.

1450
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,850
That might even be more bad ass.
Jesus fucking Christ.

1451
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,110
Yeah.
That's way better.

1452
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:58,450
Oh my God.
It's like the wolf's telling him like,

1453
01:04:58,451 --> 01:05:00,250
let's go kill that photography.
Hey Dude,

1454
01:05:00,251 --> 01:05:01,540
if you're,
if you're listening,

1455
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:02,710
uh,
scratch that.

1456
01:05:02,711 --> 01:05:06,250
Make me one of these,
make me the double wolf.

1457
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:08,170
Fuck.
That's amazing.

1458
01:05:08,650 --> 01:05:09,461
God.
Damn,

1459
01:05:09,461 --> 01:05:12,160
that's crazy.
Holy Shit.

1460
01:05:12,161 --> 01:05:15,670
What a picture that guy deserves like an
award for that picture.

1461
01:05:15,970 --> 01:05:18,340
Like that might be,
I'm going to say it is.

1462
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:21,670
That's the coolest wildlife photograph
I've ever seen.

1463
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:23,500
Wow.
That's cool.

1464
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:27,820
Because yeah,
it was undeniably cool that the photo

1465
01:05:27,821 --> 01:05:29,410
looks so rare with,
I mean,

1466
01:05:29,411 --> 01:05:32,170
how do you get a wolf with all that snow
all over his face like that.

1467
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:33,940
What are the odds you're gonna capture
that.

1468
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:36,550
And then another one,
the same size right next to him.

1469
01:05:36,551 --> 01:05:38,950
Maybe his wife.
The wife won't pay the Wolfson.

1470
01:05:38,951 --> 01:05:40,360
I left as a wife.
Who is the wife?

1471
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:41,260
The wife's on there.
Right?

1472
01:05:41,261 --> 01:05:42,510
Cause it looks like he's,
she's a bitch.

1473
01:05:42,530 --> 01:05:43,420
She's bitching at him.
Yeah.

1474
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:45,490
You don't mind the fact that he only
killed five elk.

1475
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:47,910
You sell fucking lazy when you were
younger.

1476
01:05:47,911 --> 01:05:50,830
When you first met me,
you did sound much to impress me

1477
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:55,050
because a guy's a,
an animal to get out there.

1478
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:57,400
Chris,
you're a fucking animal.

1479
01:05:58,330 --> 01:05:59,163
Uh,
just uh,

1480
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:02,350
I mean that's a Timberwolf.
Yeah,

1481
01:06:02,351 --> 01:06:03,770
man.
I think that's a yellowstone.

1482
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:05,590
She's this,
that those are in yellow.

1483
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:07,750
They have a lot of them in yellowstone.
It's crazy.

1484
01:06:08,350 --> 01:06:09,183
There's,
um,

1485
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:12,940
there's a cool video that I posted or a
photo I posted today from a national

1486
01:06:12,941 --> 01:06:13,510
geographic.

1487
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:16,840
The National Geographic instagram page
is another one I'm fucking completely

1488
01:06:16,841 --> 01:06:20,920
addicted to every other day.
They have some just whoa photo where you

1489
01:06:20,921 --> 01:06:24,430
look and you go,
fuck God dammit,

1490
01:06:24,790 --> 01:06:28,510
and today was a,
these two bears there were duking it out

1491
01:06:28,511 --> 01:06:32,080
in yellowstone.
Look at the size of these fucking

1492
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:35,920
beasts.
Look at a clause on him,

1493
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:40,540
the closet or on that one's back as
their fight is two giant ass fucking

1494
01:06:40,541 --> 01:06:45,541
grizzlies are going at it and one of
them has wolverine style razor blades

1495
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:49,840
coming out of his front arm.
Fuck man.

1496
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,290
Another John Dudley story.
John who was here yesterday,

1497
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:58,620
he saw a bear kill a moose.
He was there when a grizzly swatted a

1498
01:06:59,801 --> 01:07:02,720
moose in the back and broke it's back.
Wow.

1499
01:07:02,770 --> 01:07:06,550
He said the bear was chasing the Mousse.
It got the,

1500
01:07:06,551 --> 01:07:11,170
they got into conflict.
The bear got on top of him and swatted

1501
01:07:11,171 --> 01:07:12,460
is back and broke it.

1502
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:15,640
He said he broke his back with one
swipe.

1503
01:07:16,030 --> 01:07:18,610
Wow.
He also talked about this cabin that

1504
01:07:18,611 --> 01:07:21,610
they had in the woods where this bare
broken in the cabin,

1505
01:07:21,611 --> 01:07:25,750
pulled the wall apart,
pulled the doorframe and the door off

1506
01:07:25,751 --> 01:07:28,390
the wall with these nine inch spike
nails all around it.

1507
01:07:28,510 --> 01:07:31,270
Then there was a stove inside that
smelled like food.

1508
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:36,600
He crushed the stove to the ground like
you would stomp on a soda can just to

1509
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:40,180
ooze out whatever,
like fat and grease was inside the

1510
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:42,700
stove.
Fuck bears man.

1511
01:07:43,180 --> 01:07:46,410
Fuck that.
So crazy that we want more of those are

1512
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:48,820
like,
we need to save those when you need them

1513
01:07:48,821 --> 01:07:50,680
everywhere and the wolves to were like,
oh,

1514
01:07:50,681 --> 01:07:51,730
and they're,
they're so awesome.

1515
01:07:51,731 --> 01:07:54,790
Keeping that things a killing machine
looking right through your eyes.

1516
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:57,550
It's cool that they exist though,
you know?

1517
01:07:57,551 --> 01:08:00,820
I mean it would be kind of cool of
dinosaurs were still rare here too.

1518
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,580
If there was like a real Jurassic
island,

1519
01:08:03,850 --> 01:08:04,860
you know,
suck.

1520
01:08:05,130 --> 01:08:07,390
Come on man.
Long as you didn't have to go there.

1521
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:09,760
If it was like an island like New
Zealand.

1522
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:11,200
Yeah,
yeah.

1523
01:08:11,490 --> 01:08:12,910
The Middle Past Hawaii,
Guam.

1524
01:08:13,270 --> 01:08:14,860
Yeah.
Well New Zealand is huge.

1525
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:17,240
Probably not New Zealand.
We would want to do that to those two.

1526
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:18,770
Yeah,
they can get too big.

1527
01:08:19,490 --> 01:08:20,580
Well,
they don't have a New Zealand.

1528
01:08:20,581 --> 01:08:25,581
It was like crazy wildlife situation
because New Zealand is a fairly recent

1529
01:08:25,731 --> 01:08:29,870
continent or island as far as I know,
as far as like the volcano volcanic

1530
01:08:29,871 --> 01:08:32,630
activity of the earth.
And it wasn't a lot of land masses

1531
01:08:32,631 --> 01:08:36,950
connecting it to other places.
So they have some indigenous wildlife,

1532
01:08:36,951 --> 01:08:41,240
like a bunch of weird animals and shit,
but they also have a lot of stuff that

1533
01:08:41,241 --> 01:08:45,350
is non native that was brought in.
Like all these a hunting animals.

1534
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:48,110
These,
these really rich dudes a long time ago,

1535
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:53,270
basically turn New Zealand into a
hunting preserve and they just let these

1536
01:08:53,271 --> 01:08:56,170
stags loose.
These European dear,

1537
01:08:56,430 --> 01:08:59,390
um,
these red deer and stags tags is like,

1538
01:08:59,391 --> 01:09:02,570
uh,
a European form of elk and a,

1539
01:09:02,571 --> 01:09:04,970
they let all these things loose all
throughout New Zealand,

1540
01:09:04,971 --> 01:09:08,090
but they don't have any mountain lions.
They don't want any bobcat's.

1541
01:09:08,091 --> 01:09:09,980
They don't have wolves,
enough coyotes that,

1542
01:09:09,981 --> 01:09:13,550
of anything that kills these things.
So they have to send people out there to

1543
01:09:13,551 --> 01:09:15,230
kill him.
Like people just killing them

1544
01:09:15,231 --> 01:09:17,570
constantly.
And when some of the populations of some

1545
01:09:17,571 --> 01:09:20,690
of the animals get too high,
they have to fly over him and fucking

1546
01:09:20,691 --> 01:09:21,920
gun him down from the sky.

1547
01:09:22,190 --> 01:09:24,110
They're having this problem right now
with Cat Island,

1548
01:09:24,170 --> 01:09:27,470
which is that island of cats,
Alpha Japan and there are the,

1549
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:30,110
and they're in breeding like crazy.
It's scary.

1550
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:33,410
All these cats like thousands and
thousands of cats just live on this

1551
01:09:33,411 --> 01:09:35,480
island must smell like shit by the way,
I suppose.

1552
01:09:35,490 --> 01:09:36,600
Smells like ammonia pissed,

1553
01:09:37,580 --> 01:09:39,590
you know.
Did you see what's going on with

1554
01:09:39,591 --> 01:09:44,330
Fukushima?
Fukushima has a problem with radioactive

1555
01:09:44,331 --> 01:09:46,670
wild boars.
Nice.

1556
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:51,110
There's like hundreds of radioactive
wild boars that have taken over that

1557
01:09:51,111 --> 01:09:53,300
area because you know,
the people aren't really there anymore

1558
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:56,510
and they're running rampant and they
have a problem with them.

1559
01:09:56,511 --> 01:09:59,780
They don't know what to do.
They have radioactive wild pigs.

1560
01:10:00,590 --> 01:10:02,900
Look at this fucking thing.
Thousands of,

1561
01:10:02,901 --> 01:10:03,770
oh,
I said hundreds.

1562
01:10:03,771 --> 01:10:07,730
Thousands of radioactive boars are
overrunning farmland in Fukushima.

1563
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:10,970
But look at the photos of them.
They have some photos of these fucking

1564
01:10:10,971 --> 01:10:13,040
bores.
Um,

1565
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:14,660
maybe different article.
Yeah.

1566
01:10:14,690 --> 01:10:16,430
Here's a good one.
That might be stock footage though.

1567
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:18,710
Yeah.
Wild boar stock seat on the fucking

1568
01:10:18,711 --> 01:10:19,880
Internet wizard.
Dude.

1569
01:10:20,270 --> 01:10:23,030
I know it's probably all the photos are
probably stock,

1570
01:10:23,270 --> 01:10:27,770
but there was one video of this guy who
had like a radioactive suit on like he

1571
01:10:27,771 --> 01:10:31,460
was some sort of a scientist and these
bores were chasing him.

1572
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:33,620
Yeah,
they all look stock,

1573
01:10:34,010 --> 01:10:35,280
but whatever.
Neha,

1574
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:37,070
who the fuck's going to go there and
take those pictures?

1575
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:42,650
What is this other radioactive dudes?
Those the a,

1576
01:10:42,651 --> 01:10:46,700
the board themselves,
they have a real problem.

1577
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:50,060
Those things start turning into like
some comic book,

1578
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:54,920
Superhero type character powers.
I mean they could things of radioactive,

1579
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:59,720
like what if they start morphing?
What if it becomes super smart because

1580
01:10:59,721 --> 01:11:02,780
we already know that boards are smart.
Like pigs are supposed to be smarter

1581
01:11:02,781 --> 01:11:03,614
than dogs,
right?

1582
01:11:03,890 --> 01:11:06,200
Oh there they are.
This is the real ones.

1583
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:11,420
Shit running down the street.
Lots of them slamming into the fucking

1584
01:11:12,051 --> 01:11:14,190
fence trying to get out of this cage and
they caught him in.

1585
01:11:15,590 --> 01:11:16,670
Good luck.
Good luck.

1586
01:11:16,671 --> 01:11:17,780
Japan,
they have,

1587
01:11:17,781 --> 01:11:20,390
by the way,
that that thing is still leaking

1588
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:24,950
thousands of gallons of radioactive shit
into the water every day

1589
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:27,340
isn't California.
And we still have that gas leak up and

1590
01:11:27,341 --> 01:11:29,890
send me valley or wherever that is.
Did they?

1591
01:11:29,990 --> 01:11:31,160
Yeah,
she'll that a long time ago,

1592
01:11:31,660 --> 01:11:35,030
but that was bad.
They said it was like every car in the

1593
01:11:35,031 --> 01:11:36,800
United States,
the emissions from every car in the

1594
01:11:36,801 --> 01:11:38,840
United States in one day.
Wow.

1595
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:42,170
I might have made that number up.
FYI.

1596
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:44,630
FYI.
Powerful desk squad cop.

1597
01:11:44,631 --> 01:11:48,860
I liked this one man that I'm drinking
out of available right now at death

1598
01:11:48,861 --> 01:11:50,060
squad.
Dot TV.

1599
01:11:50,061 --> 01:11:51,320
Brian Red band creations.

1600
01:11:51,430 --> 01:11:53,920
Yeah.
That's fun stuff.

1601
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:55,000
You,
uh,

1602
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,520
you,
you remember when we used to talk about

1603
01:11:57,521 --> 01:11:59,500
that radioactive up there and,
and uh,

1604
01:11:59,501 --> 01:12:02,640
the thing I,
it's funny because I know somebody or I

1605
01:12:02,650 --> 01:12:05,320
met these triplets the other day that,
that grew up there.

1606
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:08,560
What do you think the odds are that
they're triplets because they grew up

1607
01:12:08,561 --> 01:12:11,530
near that radioactive?
What makes triplets?

1608
01:12:11,650 --> 01:12:16,360
It's a real good question.
I think horse the horse,

1609
01:12:16,550 --> 01:12:20,780
you just have to love Dick so much that
you take in so much calm that there's

1610
01:12:20,810 --> 01:12:23,960
this calm just rushes and no one egg
wins.

1611
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:27,320
Yeah.
Maybe a a dude who's just got a lot of

1612
01:12:27,321 --> 01:12:29,450
calm.
Maybe that's what makes me super

1613
01:12:29,451 --> 01:12:30,000
aggressive.

1614
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,950
[inaudible] people that have triplets my
age.

1615
01:12:31,951 --> 01:12:35,580
But I think nowadays it's probably more
for like maybe they might be using

1616
01:12:35,581 --> 01:12:37,980
fertility thing or two,
what you take like an accident they had

1617
01:12:37,981 --> 01:12:38,814
three and the only one is right.

1618
01:12:39,090 --> 01:12:41,370
That definitely happens.
That happens with the older ladies.

1619
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:45,720
That's like John and kate plus eight.
Remember that chicken like seven fucking

1620
01:12:45,721 --> 01:12:48,780
babies inside of her and when they know
eight inside of her and then two

1621
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:52,770
additionally they had to first and
decided they wanted more and so they

1622
01:12:52,771 --> 01:12:55,560
fill themselves up with babies.
And uh,

1623
01:12:55,570 --> 01:12:58,920
I remember that show.
Boy that was an interesting show because

1624
01:12:58,921 --> 01:13:03,921
that was a show that kind of showed how
much pressure of the average person gets

1625
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:09,810
under when you're under the microscope.
Like people that behave like totally

1626
01:13:09,811 --> 01:13:11,880
normal,
they think their behavior is totally

1627
01:13:11,881 --> 01:13:13,050
normal,
but then all of sudden they're under the

1628
01:13:13,051 --> 01:13:17,700
microscope and the whole world sees that
and then they get criticized and freaked

1629
01:13:17,701 --> 01:13:20,760
on and then next thing you know,
they can't handle it anymore and they

1630
01:13:20,761 --> 01:13:22,620
break up.
And then John,

1631
01:13:22,621 --> 01:13:24,780
you know,
was forced to get like regular jobs and

1632
01:13:24,781 --> 01:13:26,880
catch them dating women and it was,
you know,

1633
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:28,980
they would let hound the guy.
I remember that.

1634
01:13:29,010 --> 01:13:30,090
Yeah.
It was really ugly.

1635
01:13:30,570 --> 01:13:31,410
As real ugly.

1636
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:32,430
Okay.

1637
01:13:32,430 --> 01:13:34,530
And you know,
they're poor fucking kids,

1638
01:13:34,531 --> 01:13:35,364
man.
Yeah.

1639
01:13:35,610 --> 01:13:36,690
Almost.
Yes.

1640
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:39,000
Just weird.
So I guess they had six.

1641
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:40,440
Yeah.

1642
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:41,190
And then they,
uh,

1643
01:13:41,190 --> 01:13:43,770
they had two previous than they had six
babies inside of her.

1644
01:13:44,070 --> 01:13:45,930
And that's all those fertility drugs for
sure.

1645
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:49,170
That's a weird man.
It's weird,

1646
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:51,690
you know,
because it's also weird because I'm

1647
01:13:51,770 --> 01:13:53,490
pretty sure they were strictly
religious,

1648
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:55,710
weren't thing.
That's why I feel like that's when it

1649
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:56,640
happens.
Yeah.

1650
01:13:56,850 --> 01:14:01,770
Well not really because see like God
says be fruitful and multiply,

1651
01:14:01,771 --> 01:14:05,220
but he doesn't say anything about taking
fertility drugs in order to make that

1652
01:14:05,221 --> 01:14:06,720
happen.
You know?

1653
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:10,050
And if it's God's plan,
is it all God's plan when a scientist

1654
01:14:10,051 --> 01:14:11,590
steps in?
Is it God's plan?

1655
01:14:11,591 --> 01:14:14,230
Because a scientist is here that God
make the scientist,

1656
01:14:14,470 --> 01:14:16,210
you know,
where do you draw the line as far as

1657
01:14:16,211 --> 01:14:18,130
like what God wants because if that's
true,

1658
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:20,170
um,
someone invented abortion.

1659
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:23,620
Was it God's plan to make abortion?
It was God's plan for everything

1660
01:14:23,910 --> 01:14:26,970
and a multiple families for I'm from,
cause if like Catholic family raised

1661
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:29,430
over 10 kids,
I know at least three families that have

1662
01:14:29,431 --> 01:14:30,330
10 12 kids.

1663
01:14:30,670 --> 01:14:32,850
Again,
horse horse.

1664
01:14:33,210 --> 01:14:36,600
Was it fertility pills or of no,
it's just like they almost had one every

1665
01:14:36,601 --> 01:14:40,130
year.
They just like to fuck constant job this

1666
01:14:40,131 --> 01:14:42,420
time.
Fuck you went to all boys.

1667
01:14:42,421 --> 01:14:44,550
One's all girls.
The kid.

1668
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:45,770
10 of them.
Yeah.

1669
01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:48,300
Like 10 girls yet all blonde girls.
Yeah.

1670
01:14:48,301 --> 01:14:49,200
That's great.
Wow.

1671
01:14:49,890 --> 01:14:53,580
Lot of fucking going on 10 kids.
You know when you die,

1672
01:14:53,581 --> 01:14:56,670
how you like shoot yourself in the all
the pis and everything comes out if you

1673
01:14:56,671 --> 01:14:57,690
have any in you.
Right.

1674
01:14:58,020 --> 01:14:59,880
Well,
I mean surely there's something that you

1675
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:01,830
have an anal sex with.
A girl likes to do meth.

1676
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:04,350
Eddie Bravo.
He said that's the way to go because

1677
01:15:04,351 --> 01:15:05,150
they don't eat.

1678
01:15:05,150 --> 01:15:06,350
Ah,

1679
01:15:06,630 --> 01:15:08,480
Brian is a light bulb went off about the
math.

1680
01:15:10,290 --> 01:15:12,300
They don't eat and their apartments are
squeaky clean.

1681
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:16,290
All they do is clean their apartments.
I was just thinking of how realistic

1682
01:15:16,291 --> 01:15:17,880
would it be,
you know that Jesus on the cross,

1683
01:15:17,881 --> 01:15:20,600
if it was realistic,
if it was just shit and piss everywhere

1684
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:24,480
on the bottom of the cross and it cause
even though they probably definitely be

1685
01:15:24,481 --> 01:15:27,180
some,
I would imagine if they fed them before

1686
01:15:27,181 --> 01:15:30,480
they strung him up there.
It's interesting too because they always

1687
01:15:30,481 --> 01:15:33,510
show the crucifixion marks through the
hands,

1688
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:36,840
but apparently that's not capable of
supporting your body.

1689
01:15:36,841 --> 01:15:38,210
They go through the wrist.
Yeah.

1690
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:40,560
Yeah.
That makes sense.

1691
01:15:40,561 --> 01:15:43,620
Cause that's how you hang a deer.
You go through the,

1692
01:15:43,621 --> 01:15:46,510
the ligament behind the knee and you put
like a stick through it and you get to

1693
01:15:46,511 --> 01:15:46,960
hang up.

1694
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:48,910
No suffocation.
The way I would have hung his body.

1695
01:15:48,911 --> 01:15:52,570
He would have suffocated in a couple of
hours instead of days because the way

1696
01:15:52,571 --> 01:15:53,291
the honey,
yeah,

1697
01:15:53,291 --> 01:15:55,710
the way your body would have hung the
weight on your diaphragm or something

1698
01:15:55,711 --> 01:15:58,120
like that.
I was too much in Catholic religion

1699
01:15:58,150 --> 01:15:59,890
class to have all this stuff explained
it.

1700
01:16:00,130 --> 01:16:02,280
Now I've learned extra stuff.
No,

1701
01:16:02,870 --> 01:16:03,890
what uh,
you know,

1702
01:16:03,891 --> 01:16:07,370
there was a story that Danieli Bolelli
uh,

1703
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:10,400
of history on fire.
He's got an awesome podcast history on

1704
01:16:10,401 --> 01:16:14,300
fire and the opening podcast.
He has a pilot like episode zero zero

1705
01:16:14,301 --> 01:16:16,670
and then he says episode one in episode
one,

1706
01:16:16,671 --> 01:16:21,671
he tells a story that he told on this
podcast about this.

1707
01:16:21,950 --> 01:16:26,950
Uh,
I believe it was the Romans had hung up

1708
01:16:28,370 --> 01:16:31,310
some insane,
like a hundred miles of bodies,

1709
01:16:31,430 --> 01:16:33,230
something crazy like that.
Like what was the,

1710
01:16:33,231 --> 01:16:36,620
the actual number I remember your till
is saying that right now it was like the

1711
01:16:36,621 --> 01:16:37,500
hymn sing.
Yeah.

1712
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:41,900
It's a whole pathway or the whole road
to wherever it was a hundred miles or

1713
01:16:41,901 --> 01:16:46,040
whatever the fuck it was was just like
every x amount of meters.

1714
01:16:46,370 --> 01:16:51,370
They had a body that was crucified all,
all along the road.

1715
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:54,260
The like that was how people used to
roll back then.

1716
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,300
They used to scare the shit out of
people.

1717
01:16:56,450 --> 01:16:59,870
There was no like hiding the photos of
the caskets.

1718
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:00,620
No,
they,

1719
01:17:00,620 --> 01:17:04,130
they hung people on sticks,
stuffed them into the ground.

1720
01:17:04,310 --> 01:17:06,920
Spartacus road,
6,000 spartacus,

1721
01:17:07,010 --> 01:17:09,710
6,000.
I think it's the same thing.

1722
01:17:10,670 --> 01:17:14,660
They crucified 6,000 people.
Jesus Christ.

1723
01:17:15,110 --> 01:17:17,900
People were Baroud back then.
I mean,

1724
01:17:17,901 --> 01:17:20,440
I guess they're brutal today.
Um,

1725
01:17:20,540 --> 01:17:25,190
there was an article that I tweeted
earlier today are retweeted that.

1726
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:26,033
Um,

1727
01:17:26,670 --> 01:17:27,080
okay.

1728
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:28,750
What's her name?
Jen briny.

1729
01:17:28,751 --> 01:17:31,220
How do you Sara last name?
Um,

1730
01:17:31,970 --> 01:17:34,150
she's the one who has that a political
podcast.

1731
01:17:34,151 --> 01:17:35,900
It's supposed to be good.
What is her name?

1732
01:17:38,470 --> 01:17:39,221
But anyway,
the,

1733
01:17:39,221 --> 01:17:41,080
the articles about a guy,
he,

1734
01:17:41,081 --> 01:17:43,960
she retweeted something from,
I think it was from the Guardian where a

1735
01:17:43,961 --> 01:17:48,961
guy wrote what it feels like to be a on
the drone kill list and that he made his

1736
01:17:50,171 --> 01:17:54,100
way into Europe specifically because he
was worried that they were going to kill

1737
01:17:54,101 --> 01:17:56,950
him with a drone.
And then he used to hide and sleep under

1738
01:17:56,951 --> 01:17:59,210
trees so that his family,
Eric,

1739
01:17:59,350 --> 01:18:01,120
Jen Briny,
how you spelled?

1740
01:18:01,150 --> 01:18:02,350
B.
R.

1741
01:18:02,350 --> 01:18:02,350
I.
N.

1742
01:18:02,350 --> 01:18:02,920
E.
Y.

1743
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:05,380
Um,
that this guy would,

1744
01:18:05,410 --> 01:18:08,980
would sleep under trees.
It was in the independent sleep under

1745
01:18:08,981 --> 01:18:13,450
trees to protect his family because no
one wanted to be near him because he was

1746
01:18:13,451 --> 01:18:16,480
on the fucking kill list for drones.
Wow.

1747
01:18:17,070 --> 01:18:20,130
You see that journey with a chainsaw?
That's scary.

1748
01:18:20,730 --> 01:18:25,200
They made a drone that has a chain store
attached to it and it's like doom.

1749
01:18:26,230 --> 01:18:28,480
Did you see the [inaudible] video?
I actually haven't seen it,

1750
01:18:28,481 --> 01:18:31,770
but I saw the billboard on sunset.
It's a movie or is it a video game?

1751
01:18:31,810 --> 01:18:32,840
There's a video,
but the,

1752
01:18:32,860 --> 01:18:35,260
the video,
the video looks insane,

1753
01:18:35,261 --> 01:18:37,540
but the,
the doom billboard makes me want to play

1754
01:18:37,541 --> 01:18:38,374
doom.

1755
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:41,250
What is it?
Supply chain supplying chain saw drone.

1756
01:18:41,251 --> 01:18:44,160
They attach a chain saw to the bottom of
a drone,

1757
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:47,660
turn it on and destroy it.
I think this is the video where they'd

1758
01:18:47,661 --> 01:18:51,900
destroy a snowmen with.
But how scary is that?

1759
01:18:52,620 --> 01:18:55,170
It's a matter of time before we have to
go to war with drones,

1760
01:18:56,340 --> 01:18:57,330
right?
Yeah.

1761
01:18:58,680 --> 01:18:59,970
Oh my God,
this is letters.

1762
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:04,290
There's flying over and Jack and snow
man in the head cutting off,

1763
01:19:04,340 --> 01:19:05,173
icicles

1764
01:19:07,430 --> 01:19:08,760
released.
It's really popular.

1765
01:19:08,761 --> 01:19:11,430
That's doing some cool things.
It's like a Dji Phantom,

1766
01:19:11,431 --> 01:19:13,680
something France.
Him for it can follow you.

1767
01:19:13,740 --> 01:19:15,840
You just like tap it,
tap the screen and it'll follow you

1768
01:19:15,841 --> 01:19:17,260
around.
[inaudible] do you,

1769
01:19:17,450 --> 01:19:18,840
do you have to register drones?
Yeah.

1770
01:19:18,870 --> 01:19:19,703
Yeah.
Jeff.

1771
01:19:19,740 --> 01:19:21,540
And now,
now you do all of them?

1772
01:19:21,541 --> 01:19:22,800
Yeah.
Is it like this year I believe.

1773
01:19:22,830 --> 01:19:24,090
Oh Wow.
That's good.

1774
01:19:25,050 --> 01:19:26,910
All of those programs,
they have things built into them.

1775
01:19:26,911 --> 01:19:29,370
They won't,
they won't even let you fly into like

1776
01:19:29,430 --> 01:19:30,930
non fly zones.
Things cut,

1777
01:19:30,931 --> 01:19:31,190
cutting

1778
01:19:31,190 --> 01:19:36,020
limbs off trees and then there you have
another drone flying around taking video

1779
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:37,190
of it,
which is hilarious.

1780
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:39,680
What a weird world we're living in
today,

1781
01:19:39,681 --> 01:19:41,420
man.
I've thought about getting one just to

1782
01:19:41,421 --> 01:19:43,250
try it.
Do you told us you don't have one?

1783
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:44,870
It seems right up your alley.
Yeah.

1784
01:19:45,350 --> 01:19:47,090
Pull up the drone.
I'm not the drone.

1785
01:19:47,091 --> 01:19:48,960
The doom footage show Bryan.
It doom.

1786
01:19:48,980 --> 01:19:52,850
Go full screen please and don't,
don't play a shit until it's ready.

1787
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:53,713
Multiplier one,
right?

1788
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:54,471
Yeah.
Dude.

1789
01:19:54,471 --> 01:19:55,304
Wait.
Do you see this?

1790
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:57,370
The multiplayer looks so bad ass.
Yeah.

1791
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:01,940
It's like quake three on crack.
I shouldn't say that on steroids from

1792
01:20:01,941 --> 01:20:03,440
Hell.
No.

1793
01:20:03,770 --> 01:20:07,100
Those hacks hangs from Cra on crack from
how watch this.

1794
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:10,360
Look at this.
Look at the graphics.

1795
01:20:10,361 --> 01:20:11,194
First of all,

1796
01:20:19,790 --> 01:20:21,320
how wild is this?
Look,

1797
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:23,570
this looks,
reminds me totally click right.

1798
01:20:23,630 --> 01:20:25,430
Totally.
Well it's in software.

1799
01:20:25,431 --> 01:20:26,890
It's the same guys.
All right.

1800
01:20:27,020 --> 01:20:29,060
Oh this looks so fun.
All right.

1801
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:32,720
Should we brian,
should we get a land party in here?

1802
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:33,770
Fuck yeah,
we should.

1803
01:20:34,070 --> 01:20:35,210
We should such it should be,
yeah.

1804
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:36,200
Wow.
Okay.

1805
01:20:36,470 --> 01:20:38,870
What is the company that,
oh my God,

1806
01:20:39,050 --> 01:20:40,760
what is the company that we should,
uh,

1807
01:20:40,790 --> 01:20:44,390
by our pcs from a couple of them.
We get them Falcon or alien.

1808
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:46,880
We should get alien ware cause alienware
used to sponsor us.

1809
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:49,550
Yeah.
So just out of loyalty and respect,

1810
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:53,390
we should get alienware.
So we'll should contact alienware and

1811
01:20:53,391 --> 01:20:56,810
let them know we're going to set up a
fucking land party up or you're going

1812
01:20:56,870 --> 01:20:58,080
deep on this.
I can tell.

1813
01:20:58,200 --> 01:20:59,960
We'll have some fun.
But I want to do though,

1814
01:20:59,961 --> 01:21:04,220
Brian is you and me do this and we'll go
on twitch.

1815
01:21:04,250 --> 01:21:05,083
Yeah.
Oh yeah,

1816
01:21:05,630 --> 01:21:10,320
yeah.
We just gotta be really pc sockets

1817
01:21:10,890 --> 01:21:12,770
that's shitting happening.
What are you talking about?

1818
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:16,700
Take off your shirt as a guy on twitch
or you'll get banned.

1819
01:21:16,850 --> 01:21:19,160
Everybody that's on twitch who keep
their fucking shirt on.

1820
01:21:19,161 --> 01:21:22,190
How about that?
Except Demetrius Mighty Mouse Johnson

1821
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:26,270
and I think John Dodson's on twitch to
[inaudible] James.

1822
01:21:26,271 --> 01:21:27,590
Now all those guys could take their
shirt off.

1823
01:21:27,591 --> 01:21:29,480
Everybody else.
Keep your fucking disgusting man.

1824
01:21:29,481 --> 01:21:33,480
Boobs away from my Chris Screen.
I've never seen this.

1825
01:21:34,310 --> 01:21:38,870
I have two pounds.
Well,

1826
01:21:38,871 --> 01:21:40,250
you're lying to.
Don't lie to me.

1827
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:44,870
So alienware if you're listening and
hook us up or Falcon northwest,

1828
01:21:44,871 --> 01:21:46,760
do you want to bring us over?
Yeah,

1829
01:21:46,820 --> 01:21:47,940
I like alienware man.
I,

1830
01:21:48,010 --> 01:21:51,440
I had that old laptop that they gave us
back in the day and I will turn it on

1831
01:21:51,441 --> 01:21:54,050
the other day.
I'm pretty sure they both sponsored

1832
01:21:54,051 --> 01:21:55,610
fighters,
I'm pretty sure.

1833
01:21:55,710 --> 01:21:56,450
Did they?

1834
01:21:56,450 --> 01:21:56,810
Sure.
Yeah.

1835
01:21:56,810 --> 01:21:57,720
Yeah.
So are you,

1836
01:21:57,820 --> 01:22:01,400
I'm touting down with all but loyalty to
alienware for two reasons.

1837
01:22:01,401 --> 01:22:03,410
One,
because we used to use them.

1838
01:22:03,470 --> 01:22:04,750
I used to run the podcast,
uh,

1839
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:06,290
my,
my version of it and you know,

1840
01:22:06,291 --> 01:22:10,700
when I used to research stuff that was
all from the alienware back then.

1841
01:22:10,790 --> 01:22:13,220
That was cool.
I liked it was big ass fucking screen.

1842
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:14,880
Who did I give that to?
Okay.

1843
01:22:15,390 --> 01:22:17,030
Uh,
you remember I remembered you telling me

1844
01:22:17,031 --> 01:22:19,040
you gave it to somebody.
Somebody who plays games.

1845
01:22:19,490 --> 01:22:20,690
Don't care trainer,
didn't you?

1846
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:21,970
You have to.
Justin was the,

1847
01:22:21,970 --> 01:22:24,530
Justin probably was justin.
I think you sold it.

1848
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:26,630
They make bad ass laptop.
So I like,

1849
01:22:26,631 --> 01:22:29,450
I like how the ones that we had,
you could change all the colors of the

1850
01:22:29,451 --> 01:22:31,100
keywords.
So like half of it's purple,

1851
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:32,660
half of it's blue.
Yeah Dude,

1852
01:22:32,661 --> 01:22:35,030
I'm infatuated with the Lenovo
thinkpads.

1853
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:40,360
I read this review of a Lenovo thinkpad.
It has 15 hours of battery life that's

1854
01:22:40,521 --> 01:22:44,240
supposed to have them the most tactile
feeling keyboard.

1855
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:47,400
Like this guy was,
di did a review of it and he said that

1856
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:50,150
the keyboard itself I saved at home.
Second,

1857
01:22:50,420 --> 01:22:55,340
he said that the keyboard itself was so
good that it actually upped his words

1858
01:22:55,341 --> 01:22:57,620
per minute faster than his,
uh,

1859
01:22:57,680 --> 01:22:59,420
his average wedge,
which I was like,

1860
01:22:59,421 --> 01:23:01,190
what?
How is that even possible?

1861
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:04,040
Yeah,
but it seems like bullshit.

1862
01:23:04,190 --> 01:23:08,620
Who does that?
What we say that Lenovo thinkpad t 50

1863
01:23:08,621 --> 01:23:11,290
review and it's on Laptop magazine.

1864
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:15,580
I would do it except for the having to
deal with windows.

1865
01:23:15,650 --> 01:23:17,140
I'm just,
I'm top mag.com.

1866
01:23:17,290 --> 01:23:18,880
Yeah,
but I mean have you tried the newest

1867
01:23:18,881 --> 01:23:21,250
windows?
Like what is like windows,

1868
01:23:21,370 --> 01:23:24,280
what do we all know when those 10 for
real.

1869
01:23:24,310 --> 01:23:25,930
That's hilarious.
Um,

1870
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:29,030
but it's supposed to keyboards supposed
to be amazing and the battery life's

1871
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:30,880
supposed to be crazy.
I'm just bored.

1872
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:35,170
I just want to try something else.
I know that apple and also you can take

1873
01:23:35,171 --> 01:23:37,570
the battery out.
You'd have a separate battery.

1874
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:38,920
You remember when you could do that?
Yeah,

1875
01:23:38,921 --> 01:23:41,770
something like that.
I like the fact that you keep a fucking

1876
01:23:41,771 --> 01:23:44,280
full battery with you on that came up
that there,

1877
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:48,340
that's their kind of pitch.
I think it's lg or slide in slide out

1878
01:23:48,341 --> 01:23:49,600
battery.
And it comes with the next one.

1879
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:52,630
Well,
my galaxy until the recent one,

1880
01:23:52,631 --> 01:23:56,200
my Samsung Galaxy had that and it was
waterproof and you can take the battery

1881
01:23:56,201 --> 01:23:56,530
out.

1882
01:23:56,530 --> 01:24:00,820
It was still waterproof,
goddammit keys to be able to carry an

1883
01:24:00,821 --> 01:24:03,640
extra battery it in your laptop bag and
your,

1884
01:24:03,670 --> 01:24:05,620
your laptop was running out of battery.
Close it,

1885
01:24:05,621 --> 01:24:07,360
pop that bitch out,
pop the new end.

1886
01:24:07,361 --> 01:24:10,120
You're back in action.
Fully loaded.

1887
01:24:10,270 --> 01:24:11,980
But now you have those like portable
charger,

1888
01:24:11,981 --> 01:24:14,770
battery chargers and things like that.
So it's kind of unnecessary.

1889
01:24:14,771 --> 01:24:17,080
What's really interesting is as good,
oh yeah,

1890
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:19,420
I have one that can charge up your a
iphone,

1891
01:24:19,421 --> 01:24:21,430
I think two or three times.
Your iphone.

1892
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:23,230
Well,
what about your laptop?

1893
01:24:23,260 --> 01:24:24,950
Laptop,
that mean they have big battery pack.

1894
01:24:24,951 --> 01:24:26,800
So you've had one before.
But I had,

1895
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:30,190
when I went hunting,
I brought one with me that I didn't even

1896
01:24:30,191 --> 01:24:32,230
want abusing cause it was so tired at
the end I was like,

1897
01:24:32,231 --> 01:24:35,290
I am going to document this like William
Shakespeare.

1898
01:24:35,291 --> 01:24:37,540
I'm going to be like hemingway out there
in the field.

1899
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:38,980
Fuck that.
The end of the day,

1900
01:24:38,981 --> 01:24:41,710
you've walked 14 miles up mountains.
You're exhausted.

1901
01:24:41,711 --> 01:24:44,530
You don't want to do shit.
You take a shit in the woods,

1902
01:24:44,770 --> 01:24:47,980
dig a hole,
go back to your tent,

1903
01:24:48,070 --> 01:24:49,080
pass out.
But um,

1904
01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:51,930
I carried it around.
It was probably like at least 10 pounds.

1905
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:54,820
It was huge,
but it worked.

1906
01:24:55,750 --> 01:24:58,000
Worked when you need it.
IPAD,

1907
01:24:58,090 --> 01:24:59,200
I'm sure.
No,

1908
01:24:59,201 --> 01:25:00,060
fuck I pads.
Yeah,

1909
01:25:00,250 --> 01:25:01,480
I like a button,
man.

1910
01:25:01,481 --> 01:25:03,190
I'm a,
I'm a tactile person.

1911
01:25:03,220 --> 01:25:05,450
I like to feel buttons.
Like even I,

1912
01:25:05,470 --> 01:25:07,450
it took me a long time to get used to
the iphone,

1913
01:25:07,451 --> 01:25:10,510
but the iphone is benefits of touching
the screen.

1914
01:25:11,020 --> 01:25:12,910
You know,
having the full screen real estate for

1915
01:25:12,911 --> 01:25:15,610
videos and photographs and email.
It's so worth it.

1916
01:25:15,730 --> 01:25:18,840
It's so worth it because I know that
blackberry came out with a new one with

1917
01:25:18,841 --> 01:25:22,480
a giant ass screen and then the,
the thing slides out the bottom and then

1918
01:25:22,481 --> 01:25:24,920
you have a keyboard,
not pioneer.

1919
01:25:25,390 --> 01:25:29,080
No enough is enough.
You could just get the ipad pro with a

1920
01:25:29,110 --> 01:25:30,300
keyboard,
like a real keyboard.

1921
01:25:30,330 --> 01:25:32,890
My snap.
You can't save files.

1922
01:25:32,970 --> 01:25:33,791
I can,
no,

1923
01:25:33,791 --> 01:25:35,770
you can't.
You can't like put like Microsoft word

1924
01:25:35,771 --> 01:25:38,370
files in a folder on your desktop.
Yeah,

1925
01:25:38,380 --> 01:25:40,450
they have Microsoft word now on your
desktop,

1926
01:25:40,460 --> 01:25:42,970
but you can put it in the cloud
equivalent thing.

1927
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:47,340
You can nowadays it close to you.
What do you mean close to that?

1928
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:50,440
Oh,
does it go in the cloud or is it uh,

1929
01:25:50,860 --> 01:25:53,650
uh,
it probably is saved on your ipad but I

1930
01:25:53,651 --> 01:25:57,050
bet you could use like the docs app for
Google or something like that.

1931
01:25:57,590 --> 01:25:59,440
Yeah.
Pages for that's on that and you can

1932
01:25:59,441 --> 01:26:01,690
save it on something.
So offline use,

1933
01:26:01,691 --> 01:26:06,691
it's cached and the new force speaker
system on the ipad pro is bad ass.

1934
01:26:07,340 --> 01:26:09,890
There's four different speakers and it
detects if you're holding it.

1935
01:26:09,890 --> 01:26:11,870
So like it,
if you're holding it on the left side it

1936
01:26:11,871 --> 01:26:14,520
will make a,
the bottom left louder,

1937
01:26:14,521 --> 01:26:15,740
you know to,
you know,

1938
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:17,800
it knows where your hands are.
Tom Or whatever.

1939
01:26:17,820 --> 01:26:20,570
Use that though is in a hotel room.
In a hotel room.

1940
01:26:20,571 --> 01:26:22,370
I have one of those little bluetooth
speakers.

1941
01:26:22,430 --> 01:26:24,470
Those tubes.
It is so good.

1942
01:26:24,471 --> 01:26:25,640
Bad.
It sounds so good.

1943
01:26:25,641 --> 01:26:29,000
I bring that fucker with me to green
rooms now because I sometimes you're in

1944
01:26:29,001 --> 01:26:31,910
a green room and you'll listen to some
CNC music factory and shit.

1945
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:33,110
Dat,
Dat,

1946
01:26:33,170 --> 01:26:33,801
Dat,
Dat,

1947
01:26:33,801 --> 01:26:34,850
dat,
Dat,

1948
01:26:34,851 --> 01:26:35,684
dat.
Come on.

1949
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:37,430
I don't,
this is not what I want to hear.

1950
01:26:37,431 --> 01:26:39,410
When I get ready for a show,
I want to hear my shit.

1951
01:26:39,780 --> 01:26:42,530
It's like put on some cool music.
It's great man.

1952
01:26:42,531 --> 01:26:44,690
It's great having one was little things
because it's so small.

1953
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:46,670
Why did they have,
has anyone ever asked you or have you

1954
01:26:46,671 --> 01:26:48,050
ever thought of like,
uh,

1955
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:50,900
having your own playlist before you go
on?

1956
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:55,900
I guess for the theater when people,
I don't want to infringe on the creative

1957
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:59,330
rights of the guy.
Who's the sound guy in that situation

1958
01:26:59,331 --> 01:27:01,130
you just said,
right now you've got someone picking a C

1959
01:27:01,131 --> 01:27:03,320
and c music factory to warm up your
crowd like that.

1960
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:05,720
I'm totally making that part up but it
can happen.

1961
01:27:06,050 --> 01:27:08,000
But no,
there've been some bad fucking music.

1962
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:12,860
There've been some bad music way.
Where the fuck did you get CNC music

1963
01:27:12,861 --> 01:27:17,660
factors and that's a randomly allocating
something really shitty from a long time

1964
01:27:17,660 --> 01:27:19,520
ago.
That's hilarious.

1965
01:27:19,521 --> 01:27:20,750
I haven't thought about that.
I want to go,

1966
01:27:23,050 --> 01:27:25,400
I mean you could have like a nice little
like just even like if you just put it

1967
01:27:25,401 --> 01:27:28,910
in your warmup or your workout playlist
and just have those like rock songs with

1968
01:27:28,911 --> 01:27:31,220
a couple of a hip hop songs.
Like that'd be good to play for 30

1969
01:27:31,221 --> 01:27:36,221
minutes while someone's warming up
instead of a anything random love shack

1970
01:27:36,231 --> 01:27:37,140
or be 50 Tuesdays.

1971
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:40,310
Yeah,
they do that a lot but sometimes they

1972
01:27:40,311 --> 01:27:42,560
get good songs.
Like there was a place where at the

1973
01:27:42,561 --> 01:27:46,490
other day in um,
Santa Barbara,

1974
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:49,610
we did the Arlington Theater,
which was fucking awesome.

1975
01:27:49,910 --> 01:27:54,080
Hinchcliffe Diaz and I did this theater
in Santa Barbara is great fuck and I

1976
01:27:54,090 --> 01:27:57,560
loves it above.
That's my spot,

1977
01:27:57,561 --> 01:27:59,600
dude.
That is the spot and I want to talk

1978
01:27:59,601 --> 01:28:02,060
about it anymore.
I don't want to talk anymore.

1979
01:28:02,090 --> 01:28:05,330
I don't want anybody to know about it.
So it's such a nice city and how much

1980
01:28:05,331 --> 01:28:06,740
land you could get out there.
Also,

1981
01:28:06,830 --> 01:28:10,010
if you bring up just winning a little
gross from cattle.

1982
01:28:10,430 --> 01:28:11,800
Whoo.
Um,

1983
01:28:11,950 --> 01:28:13,790
but anyway,
my point being they had a,

1984
01:28:13,791 --> 01:28:16,670
they were playing some music.
I saved it on my shoulders,

1985
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:18,350
lamb,
and it was,

1986
01:28:18,351 --> 01:28:20,030
uh,
it was some sort of,

1987
01:28:20,031 --> 01:28:21,950
um,
Spanish music,

1988
01:28:21,980 --> 01:28:24,620
like some Spanish rock that I'd never
heard of before and they're singing it

1989
01:28:24,621 --> 01:28:25,940
in Spanish.
I was like,

1990
01:28:25,941 --> 01:28:27,410
God damn,
this is awesome.

1991
01:28:27,770 --> 01:28:29,210
Like whatever it is.
I love it.

1992
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:32,270
I don't remember what it was.
One direction.

1993
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:35,270
No,
no.

1994
01:28:36,380 --> 01:28:40,580
Spark up my cute it.
Would you say Jamie was given another

1995
01:28:40,581 --> 01:28:43,640
shitty band?
It's called middle.

1996
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:49,360
It says dj snake featuring bipolar
sunshine.

1997
01:28:51,710 --> 01:28:53,480
What's that even mean?
I don't know man.

1998
01:28:54,770 --> 01:28:56,480
I Dunno,
but uh,

1999
01:28:56,900 --> 01:28:58,270
see if you could find that.
I got it.

2000
01:28:59,060 --> 01:29:01,030
Listen to this.
We'll fuck us up.

2001
01:29:01,220 --> 01:29:03,690
That's fine.
It'll fuck us up on youtube.

2002
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,860
50 million views on youtube.
Oh,

2003
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:11,400
bipolar sunshine,
a snippet of it.

2004
01:29:11,430 --> 01:29:13,020
I can get it for the audio.
Okay.

2005
01:29:13,220 --> 01:29:14,970
For us,
for the audio listening.

2006
01:29:15,850 --> 01:29:17,730
Youtube people won't hear this part.
Okay.

2007
01:29:18,110 --> 01:29:21,990
Youtube people
should I sing along?

2008
01:29:21,991 --> 01:29:24,810
So it's like there's this,
is this definitely the one that I,

2009
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:29,310
this is not sound like it.
How do you know what you've seen now

2010
01:29:29,311 --> 01:29:32,550
that ain't that Jamie,
oh,

2011
01:29:32,551 --> 01:29:33,450
this is it.
I'm sorry.

2012
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:35,010
I'm sorry.
Try this.

2013
01:29:35,610 --> 01:29:38,730
Uh,
it is a l e,

2014
01:29:38,731 --> 01:29:43,710
g r e two zero zero three.
Yeah.

2015
01:29:43,711 --> 01:29:45,720
Alegria and then it's like a little
space.

2016
01:29:45,721 --> 01:29:50,721
Two zero zero three truby trio.
This is what it was.

2017
01:29:51,460 --> 01:29:52,350
Um,
that would,

2018
01:29:52,351 --> 01:29:53,810
that one was that I just,
um,

2019
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:55,530
said was one that,
um,

2020
01:29:55,890 --> 01:29:59,040
was it showed up at the front of Shizam
and I mistakenly thought it was the last

2021
01:29:59,041 --> 01:30:01,500
one that I shazammed is that a verb?

2022
01:30:02,070 --> 01:30:06,990
Shizam she's doing this now.
I fucking love Shizam that's such a

2023
01:30:06,991 --> 01:30:08,070
great application.
You know,

2024
01:30:08,071 --> 01:30:10,230
you don't even have to use it anymore.
You could just use Siri.

2025
01:30:10,231 --> 01:30:12,150
She doesn't know I'm done.
I'm like that bitch.

2026
01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:13,013
Yeah.
What?

2027
01:30:13,740 --> 01:30:14,573
Yeah,
this is it.

2028
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:17,490
This definitely it.
Does this have any hits online?

2029
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:22,680
So the youtube people hear this or no,
you don't even hear anything?

2030
01:30:22,681 --> 01:30:26,490
Youtube people for you,
like what is happening over there?

2031
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:30,690
You're going to have to go to it.
It sounds like jumps not good,

2032
01:30:30,691 --> 01:30:32,310
dude.
It gets going,

2033
01:30:33,390 --> 01:30:36,450
but it's what I like about Spanish.
Music is a,

2034
01:30:36,990 --> 01:30:38,370
I don't know what the fuck they're
saying.

2035
01:30:38,610 --> 01:30:40,980
So it's cool.
Like I get the emotions and I get the

2036
01:30:40,981 --> 01:30:44,400
Vibe,
but it's rusted,

2037
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:46,620
rusted root.
That sounds like your Dick.

2038
01:30:46,621 --> 01:30:48,810
Now after you bang a chick was on the
period.

2039
01:30:52,020 --> 01:30:53,460
Oh God,
no.

2040
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:57,540
I have so big
an 18 inch root.

2041
01:30:57,541 --> 01:30:59,310
Keep this going.
If the youtube people don't hear it,

2042
01:30:59,580 --> 01:31:01,350
do you think it will get us pulled off
itunes?

2043
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:02,220
That won't happen,
right?

2044
01:31:04,100 --> 01:31:05,240
Yeah.
Um,

2045
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:09,930
but Joey Diaz,
his cousin has a ban from Cuba.

2046
01:31:09,931 --> 01:31:10,764
It's awesome.
That is.

2047
01:31:10,890 --> 01:31:13,560
They're fucking amazing.
And they're on my playlist here.

2048
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:14,890
Oh really?
Yeah.

2049
01:31:14,900 --> 01:31:17,370
With Alfonso X.
X.

2050
01:31:17,371 --> 01:31:20,250
Alfonso X.
It's x a.

2051
01:31:20,251 --> 01:31:22,770
L.
P.

2052
01:31:22,770 --> 01:31:22,770
H.
O.

2053
01:31:22,770 --> 01:31:22,770
N.
S.

2054
01:31:22,770 --> 01:31:24,270
O.
There are fucking bat.

2055
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:25,290
What is that?
That's the thing.

2056
01:31:25,291 --> 01:31:27,720
That was the route that was poured out
of a dude's ass.

2057
01:31:27,721 --> 01:31:28,810
Come on son.
Yeah,

2058
01:31:28,890 --> 01:31:32,760
he used it for sexual play.
Come on

2059
01:31:34,270 --> 01:31:37,050
from the anal cavity.
Oh my God.

2060
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:40,190
Well,
it takes about 35 years of ass fucking

2061
01:31:40,191 --> 01:31:44,610
to take so much dick in your acid wides
it up to take that route.

2062
01:31:44,730 --> 01:31:48,000
We're looking at a route that is about
the size of Jamie's whole leg.

2063
01:31:49,020 --> 01:31:50,080
Right.
If you had to guess.

2064
01:31:50,090 --> 01:31:52,690
Yeah your arm.
No,

2065
01:31:52,710 --> 01:31:56,760
go back to that.
Let me say that photo that looks like

2066
01:31:56,970 --> 01:32:00,580
more like a leg dude.
It's like a baby,

2067
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:03,010
you know that's like,
that's like tate Fletcher's forearm.

2068
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:08,130
It's like a big giant man's forearm.
That's like my Dick on the opponent

2069
01:32:08,131 --> 01:32:10,490
pill.
Right there isn't the same color too

2070
01:32:10,870 --> 01:32:12,610
ready to explode like an Oscar Meyer
Wiener.

2071
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:18,720
Did I tell you I use Suntan lotion on my
dick and I actually made my Dick Black

2072
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:22,120
Brown and mean tanner self.
Tanner Tanner.

2073
01:32:22,121 --> 01:32:24,280
Cause I did have any lotion and I was
like,

2074
01:32:24,281 --> 01:32:26,020
who's tanneries was like an ex
girlfriends.

2075
01:32:26,021 --> 01:32:28,810
I'm like well this is lotion.
And so you turned your Dick to block,

2076
01:32:28,811 --> 01:32:30,760
turned it to like a orange,
just brownish.

2077
01:32:30,810 --> 01:32:34,300
And it was so weird cause it,
it actually changed the color of my

2078
01:32:34,301 --> 01:32:34,991
Dick.
Wow.

2079
01:32:34,991 --> 01:32:38,500
So between that and the boner pills,
what kind of birth defects you think

2080
01:32:38,501 --> 01:32:41,290
your children would have adopting an
Asian girl.

2081
01:32:41,350 --> 01:32:43,690
And I'm like,
you're going to go with y'all and style.

2082
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:44,553
Yeah,
I mean,

2083
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:45,401
look,
don't do it.

2084
01:32:45,401 --> 01:32:49,340
Raise her to be awesome girlfriend or
was Russian and took this shot.

2085
01:32:49,820 --> 01:32:51,610
I was listening to this woody Allen
thing the other day.

2086
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:54,610
It's woody Allen on comedy.
It's really interesting because it's

2087
01:32:54,611 --> 01:32:55,970
woody allen.
Uh,

2088
01:32:56,140 --> 01:32:56,973
there was,
uh,

2089
01:32:57,070 --> 01:32:59,840
two things that I bought.
One of them is woody Allen doing stand

2090
01:32:59,841 --> 01:33:02,290
up in like the 1960s.
It's good.

2091
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:04,330
He's good.
He was a very good stand up man.

2092
01:33:04,570 --> 01:33:06,100
He was a good comic.
Why shaking your head?

2093
01:33:06,220 --> 01:33:06,920
I just hit,
he,

2094
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:08,500
he,
he's a whiner to me.

2095
01:33:08,700 --> 01:33:11,440
It wasn't that windy back then.
It wasn't that one you back then.

2096
01:33:11,441 --> 01:33:12,040
It was,
um,

2097
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:13,930
it was a different style.
I mean it was,

2098
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:15,340
it was different.
He was a different guy.

2099
01:33:15,341 --> 01:33:19,360
He was a young guy and he was known more
of as a comic.

2100
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:21,040
And then there's also,
uh,

2101
01:33:21,190 --> 01:33:26,190
an interview where it's just woody allen
talking about the process of creating

2102
01:33:26,471 --> 01:33:29,640
comedy and what he did.
And that's kind of after he hits stuff.

2103
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:30,401
Yeah,
that's it right there.

2104
01:33:30,401 --> 01:33:33,860
Those are the two of them.
Woody Allen on comedy and then Woody

2105
01:33:33,860 --> 01:33:36,580
Allen standup comic.
Those are the two that I was listening

2106
01:33:36,581 --> 01:33:38,410
to back to back.
It just,

2107
01:33:39,070 --> 01:33:40,630
you know,
I'm not,

2108
01:33:40,690 --> 01:33:43,240
certainly not sympathetic to like what
he's done.

2109
01:33:43,270 --> 01:33:45,040
I mean,
he's such a fucking Weirdo and what he's

2110
01:33:45,041 --> 01:33:46,960
done,
just this,

2111
01:33:46,961 --> 01:33:50,230
the fact that that girl was his daughter
and I guess it's so creepy to me write

2112
01:33:50,470 --> 01:33:55,470
to everybody,
but looking past that and just trying

2113
01:33:55,631 --> 01:33:56,350
to,
uh,

2114
01:33:56,350 --> 01:33:58,700
examine him as a human being.
What a,

2115
01:33:58,701 --> 01:34:01,060
a,
a complex and weird human being he is.

2116
01:34:01,061 --> 01:34:02,470
He's,
he's pretty fascinating.

2117
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:04,840
And I don't think he's victimizing
anybody else,

2118
01:34:04,841 --> 01:34:05,800
at least as far as I know.

2119
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:08,080
So I don't,
I don't have any judgment.

2120
01:34:08,110 --> 01:34:08,980
I'll just,
whatever.

2121
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:10,510
He's not in jail,
so no one's,

2122
01:34:10,570 --> 01:34:12,750
no one's going after him.
So whatever.

2123
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:13,301
I'm,
so,

2124
01:34:13,301 --> 01:34:16,150
I'm,
I'm just watching his life.

2125
01:34:16,151 --> 01:34:19,360
I'm just looking at his life and he's
such a fascinating character,

2126
01:34:19,361 --> 01:34:20,650
man.
You know,

2127
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:24,040
he is a jazz musician and for awhile he
did,

2128
01:34:24,041 --> 01:34:28,750
he did a documentary before everything
got real ugly right where he was going

2129
01:34:28,751 --> 01:34:31,180
around.
Was it before everything got real ugly

2130
01:34:31,181 --> 01:34:35,710
or was it in the middle of it all?
But he went around playing jazz

2131
01:34:35,711 --> 01:34:37,870
concerts.
Like that was always like sort of like

2132
01:34:37,871 --> 01:34:40,300
a,
a dream that he had.

2133
01:34:40,330 --> 01:34:43,660
So he went around and doing a bunch of
jazz concerts and um,

2134
01:34:44,140 --> 01:34:46,270
he writes all of his scripts.
Yeah,

2135
01:34:46,271 --> 01:34:48,400
there it is.
Wild Man Blues.

2136
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:53,560
1997 wonder who named it.
Maybe it was ironic,

2137
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:57,920
ironic calling him the wild wild man
blues or is building a wild man.

2138
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:01,440
I wonder when was,
if some of it's,

2139
01:35:01,450 --> 01:35:02,930
that's 97.
When did,

2140
01:35:02,931 --> 01:35:04,870
um,
all this controversy take place?

2141
01:35:04,890 --> 01:35:06,050
I think before this,
right?

2142
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:07,970
Well,
I don't think so because that's 20 years

2143
01:35:07,971 --> 01:35:10,460
ago.
So 20 years ago that that girl was like

2144
01:35:10,461 --> 01:35:12,560
10.
You know what I'm saying?

2145
01:35:13,010 --> 01:35:15,320
It's just weird how we still celebrate
woody Allen,

2146
01:35:15,321 --> 01:35:18,920
but yet fucking Cosby,
forget about it.

2147
01:35:20,510 --> 01:35:22,640
We celebrate woody Allen macaws.
We forget about it.

2148
01:35:22,641 --> 01:35:25,640
Well,
woody Allen seems to have fallen in love

2149
01:35:25,641 --> 01:35:28,100
with a girl that he adopted,
which is this crazy.

2150
01:35:28,220 --> 01:35:33,220
It was in 1992 when it started as just a
quote filling 23 she responded to

2151
01:35:34,041 --> 01:35:37,250
someone paternal.
Woody Allen reveals secret to his 23

2152
01:35:37,251 --> 01:35:40,010
year relationship with Mia Farrow's
adopted daughter,

2153
01:35:40,011 --> 01:35:41,960
which at first he thought it was just a
fling.

2154
01:35:42,440 --> 01:35:45,230
What do y'all and went to [inaudible]
rare details about his relationship with

2155
01:35:45,231 --> 01:35:47,390
Sunni.
They got together while he was dating

2156
01:35:47,391 --> 01:35:52,391
her adopted mother Mia Farrow.
Now married Sunni 44 and Alan 79 had

2157
01:35:52,701 --> 01:35:54,890
been together for 23 years.
Whoa.

2158
01:35:54,950 --> 01:35:57,770
I see what she looks like.
So she was 21 when they started getting

2159
01:35:57,771 --> 01:36:00,200
it on.
Alan said,

2160
01:36:00,230 --> 01:36:01,880
well,
he's 80 there,

2161
01:36:01,881 --> 01:36:02,990
dude.
I mean,

2162
01:36:02,991 --> 01:36:07,910
she is.
She's half his age and she's 44 she

2163
01:36:07,911 --> 01:36:09,320
likes that Daddy Dick.
I mean,

2164
01:36:09,321 --> 01:36:11,540
what the fuck man?
Yeah,

2165
01:36:11,541 --> 01:36:15,260
she's 44 and he's 79 that is crazy.
She's almost half his age.

2166
01:36:16,660 --> 01:36:19,060
Wow.
They'd been together for 23 years.

2167
01:36:19,570 --> 01:36:20,403
Oh,
I'm sorry.

2168
01:36:20,850 --> 01:36:22,450
Go back.
Go down.

2169
01:36:23,140 --> 01:36:23,973
No,
go down.

2170
01:36:24,670 --> 01:36:25,840
No,
no where it was.

2171
01:36:25,950 --> 01:36:26,783
Yeah.
Thanks.

2172
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:30,070
Um,
Alan says it worked because he was

2173
01:36:30,071 --> 01:36:32,710
paternal,
which helped her flourish.

2174
01:36:33,010 --> 01:36:36,160
And these are in quotes,
paternal and flourish or in quotes.

2175
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:41,170
He also reveals that he thought it would
be just a flame when they started lang.

2176
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:43,510
That mean he just flame raped her or
something.

2177
01:36:43,830 --> 01:36:45,790
Oh,
he just got away with fucking his

2178
01:36:45,791 --> 01:36:50,791
daughter is when it was weird man.
So where he looks so odd and that photo

2179
01:36:50,951 --> 01:36:52,390
too.
And that's 92.

2180
01:36:52,630 --> 01:36:53,291
How,
wait,

2181
01:36:53,291 --> 01:36:56,770
how old was she when they adopted her?
Like 17 cause then I can get into that.

2182
01:36:57,310 --> 01:36:58,930
Was this article from 90 to Jamie?

2183
01:37:01,790 --> 01:37:02,230
Nope.

2184
01:37:02,230 --> 01:37:04,080
Oh,
published 2015 oh,

2185
01:37:04,081 --> 01:37:08,420
why just say 92 now?
The fling started in 1992 oh,

2186
01:37:08,510 --> 01:37:09,950
okay.
That makes sense.

2187
01:37:09,951 --> 01:37:11,750
Cause how the fuck was she?
Yeah.

2188
01:37:11,751 --> 01:37:15,350
Okay.
Then I'm retarded because in 1992 that

2189
01:37:15,351 --> 01:37:16,580
makes sense.
Wow.

2190
01:37:16,581 --> 01:37:17,990
That's so weird though,
Dude.

2191
01:37:18,590 --> 01:37:21,860
So he talks about it now and they've
been married forever.

2192
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:26,720
See that's what's fucked up about it.
What's fucked up about it is it worked.

2193
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:31,040
They've been together for 23 years.
They have children.

2194
01:37:31,041 --> 01:37:33,200
Look at that photo of him,
let's scroll down and look at their

2195
01:37:33,201 --> 01:37:34,250
photo.
They're smiling there,

2196
01:37:34,251 --> 01:37:35,380
arm in arm,
they leave,

2197
01:37:35,410 --> 01:37:37,580
they're happy together.
It's fucked up,

2198
01:37:37,581 --> 01:37:39,830
but it works.
So I get a certain point in time.

2199
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:41,360
I mean,
it's not,

2200
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:44,030
they're not genetically related,
which is always the big concern.

2201
01:37:44,031 --> 01:37:46,280
Right.
The big concern was that your genes

2202
01:37:46,281 --> 01:37:49,040
would be,
if you had sex with someone who's your

2203
01:37:49,041 --> 01:37:52,100
actual daughter,
your genes be all fucked up and you'd

2204
01:37:52,101 --> 01:37:52,790
uh,
oh,

2205
01:37:52,790 --> 01:37:54,690
she's kissing him on the cheek.
She seems to love them.

2206
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:57,300
Shovel head.
But you know what I'm saying?

2207
01:37:57,600 --> 01:37:58,261
I mean,
it's like,

2208
01:37:58,261 --> 01:38:01,770
uh,
we have these ideas of what's,

2209
01:38:01,771 --> 01:38:03,860
uh,
what's okay and not okay and it's

2210
01:38:03,870 --> 01:38:07,020
certainly seems fucked up.
But if she was 21 when it happened,

2211
01:38:07,230 --> 01:38:09,210
she was a grown woman and she decided,
you know what,

2212
01:38:10,110 --> 01:38:13,020
I want to fuck my dad,
my sort of dad,

2213
01:38:14,310 --> 01:38:16,770
the guy who lives across the lives
across the city,

2214
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:17,290
they live in like

2215
01:38:17,290 --> 01:38:19,480
opposite sides of the parking or so in
this picture,

2216
01:38:19,510 --> 01:38:19,961
I mean,
yeah,

2217
01:38:19,961 --> 01:38:22,690
I could see what he was doing.
He was probably fucking her though at

2218
01:38:22,691 --> 01:38:24,940
this age.
That's what the problem is as it's

2219
01:38:24,950 --> 01:38:26,410
parental,
you know,

2220
01:38:26,470 --> 01:38:29,500
he should not be,
he might have like raised her to want

2221
01:38:29,501 --> 01:38:31,120
that Dick.
Ooh.

2222
01:38:31,570 --> 01:38:36,520
I mean if,
if you can adopt a girl at 17 maybe find

2223
01:38:36,521 --> 01:38:37,900
like,
I mean that's not bad.

2224
01:38:37,901 --> 01:38:39,970
Right.
Cause it's like if you were like a

2225
01:38:39,971 --> 01:38:41,890
parent to a kid for like six months.

2226
01:38:42,410 --> 01:38:44,090
Yeah,
I'm well I'm sure that's been done.

2227
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:47,320
Wasn't it like a Ted nugent?
I just,

2228
01:38:47,350 --> 01:38:49,310
it wasn't,
it jokingly hinted out for a long time

2229
01:38:49,311 --> 01:38:51,020
before they actually came out and said
like,

2230
01:38:51,050 --> 01:38:51,890
oh,
I don't know actually,

2231
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,720
I don't know.
But Ted nugent did that.

2232
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:59,320
Ted nugent adopted a girl.
So like Google that there was like some

2233
01:38:59,451 --> 01:39:00,560
crazy controversy

2234
01:39:02,270 --> 01:39:04,800
cause I mean that might not be a bad
deal checking out some of these like

2235
01:39:04,830 --> 01:39:07,710
orphanage websites and just finding the
17 year old ones.

2236
01:39:08,690 --> 01:39:09,630
Yeah.
It's fun to it.

2237
01:39:10,490 --> 01:39:11,120
See if,
uh,

2238
01:39:11,120 --> 01:39:12,450
but good.
Just Google that,

2239
01:39:12,870 --> 01:39:13,411
you know,
he,

2240
01:39:13,411 --> 01:39:18,411
well he wrote songs about like having
sex with young young ladies that were

2241
01:39:18,721 --> 01:39:21,090
very young under age.
Ted nugent pick,

2242
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:22,610
Ooh,
yeah.

2243
01:39:24,030 --> 01:39:25,860
Legal Guardian.
He became her legal guardian.

2244
01:39:25,861 --> 01:39:27,030
That's what it is.
He didn't adopt her.

2245
01:39:27,780 --> 01:39:30,780
She was 17 that's exactly head of his
time.

2246
01:39:30,870 --> 01:39:32,400
But back then.
Okay.

2247
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:34,680
What year was this when this happened?
All right,

2248
01:39:34,710 --> 01:39:36,630
get rid of these photos.
Gross me out.

2249
01:39:37,620 --> 01:39:38,880
Um,
what year was that?

2250
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:44,000
[inaudible] 78 78
how much different with things back then

2251
01:39:44,190 --> 01:39:47,400
do you take that into consideration?
You have to almost all the time.

2252
01:39:47,401 --> 01:39:52,290
It's hard to consider the con.
That's like the context of what's going

2253
01:39:52,291 --> 01:39:52,710
on.
Right.

2254
01:39:52,710 --> 01:39:54,840
What was the context in the culture at
the time?

2255
01:39:55,170 --> 01:39:57,330
Because we were talking about that with
the socrates.

2256
01:39:57,900 --> 01:39:59,420
Socrates was,
you know,

2257
01:39:59,490 --> 01:40:02,970
they were all pederasts,
they all liked to bang young boys.

2258
01:40:03,060 --> 01:40:05,040
It was real common back then.
And,

2259
01:40:05,041 --> 01:40:09,480
but yet no one,
no one has a little asterisk next to

2260
01:40:09,481 --> 01:40:11,610
everything soccer.
He said you don't say,

2261
01:40:11,730 --> 01:40:14,310
but remember he used to bang little
boys,

2262
01:40:14,730 --> 01:40:17,040
you know,
but if that was today you would,

2263
01:40:17,790 --> 01:40:20,850
so as far as like woody Allen did,
it's creepy,

2264
01:40:21,630 --> 01:40:22,710
but is it bad?

2265
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:27,720
It just depends when it started and if
it started when she was 12 or something

2266
01:40:27,721 --> 01:40:29,910
like that,
then he could have like totally fucking,

2267
01:40:30,090 --> 01:40:31,920
yeah.
Brainwashed her to the point where now

2268
01:40:31,921 --> 01:40:33,690
she just thinks she has to be with him

2269
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:36,530
and there was a mia frowns.
Other daughter was saying that he did

2270
01:40:36,531 --> 01:40:40,160
something to her too.
But Woody Allen was saying that.

2271
01:40:40,250 --> 01:40:41,690
What do be US magazine?
I like,

2272
01:40:42,590 --> 01:40:44,570
I'm going to stop right here and talking
about it all day.

2273
01:40:44,790 --> 01:40:47,210
Yeah.
Jamie's Colby Bryant's new sneakers road

2274
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:50,210
last day.
Shut your mouth.

2275
01:40:50,390 --> 01:40:53,770
How do you even know that 20,000 bucks
to go to that game if you want to go.

2276
01:40:53,950 --> 01:40:55,840
What?
He would pay that much money for a

2277
01:40:55,841 --> 01:40:57,460
baseball game.
It's basketball.

2278
01:41:00,330 --> 01:41:02,400
Yeah.
Who would man crazy

2279
01:41:03,320 --> 01:41:05,480
kids from?
They're American but they flew,

2280
01:41:05,481 --> 01:41:09,410
they like left Italy to follow them
around all year and it's been a bunch of

2281
01:41:09,411 --> 01:41:10,610
money.
They haven't said how much in debt

2282
01:41:10,611 --> 01:41:12,500
there,
but they've gone to like 30 plus games

2283
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:13,490
all over the country.

2284
01:41:14,090 --> 01:41:15,170
Um,
that's not crazy

2285
01:41:15,230 --> 01:41:16,340
fans.
Yes.

2286
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:17,780
A lot of,
a lot of them are Asian though.

2287
01:41:17,781 --> 01:41:19,850
He did a really good job marketing
himself in Asia.

2288
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:21,380
Did he,
how did he do that?

2289
01:41:21,860 --> 01:41:23,540
Nike.
They took him over there every year in

2290
01:41:23,541 --> 01:41:25,370
the off season.
He would go play and do like a

2291
01:41:25,380 --> 01:41:29,510
exhibitions and whatnot and they were
doing it to get the Asian market into

2292
01:41:29,511 --> 01:41:31,950
the MBA and it worked.
The devil,

2293
01:41:32,780 --> 01:41:36,090
they make a lot of money off the Asian
market way more than I would sit and

2294
01:41:36,100 --> 01:41:38,000
make the United States.
Obviously there's more people there,

2295
01:41:38,030 --> 01:41:42,230
but they love basketball there.
Stephon Marbury left the United States,

2296
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:44,750
went and made a lot of money there.
He's going to retire as like one of the

2297
01:41:44,751 --> 01:41:47,900
most famous hall of famers and Chinese
basket.

2298
01:41:47,930 --> 01:41:49,670
Well,
what happened to Lynn Sanity?

2299
01:41:50,090 --> 01:41:52,520
Obviously I'm on the outside.
I don't hear about that dude anymore.

2300
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:54,470
He's in Charlotte right now.
That's why I'm,

2301
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:55,940
but what's happening?
Is he doing well?

2302
01:41:55,970 --> 01:41:57,020
He's okay.
He's just an average,

2303
01:41:57,021 --> 01:42:00,110
really good point guard.
What the fuck happened during that one

2304
01:42:00,111 --> 01:42:02,270
time where he's just New York and what
was he doing?

2305
01:42:02,271 --> 01:42:03,740
He's just kept hitting three pointers or
something.

2306
01:42:03,741 --> 01:42:04,580
I'm really good street.
Yeah.

2307
01:42:04,590 --> 01:42:08,210
Give like 10 games where he played
extremely well and they needed some

2308
01:42:08,211 --> 01:42:11,520
hyped of weight and he was playing into
the hike and it worked out

2309
01:42:11,750 --> 01:42:14,060
and now it's over.
It's not that it's over,

2310
01:42:14,061 --> 01:42:15,410
it's just there's other things to talk
about.

2311
01:42:15,460 --> 01:42:17,480
Yeah.
But how come like me on the outside,

2312
01:42:17,930 --> 01:42:21,620
I find out about athletes when they're
in trouble or they do something crazy.

2313
01:42:21,950 --> 01:42:23,510
They have to do something like really
good.

2314
01:42:24,050 --> 01:42:25,730
Like that's the only time I,
and I remember thinking,

2315
01:42:25,731 --> 01:42:27,410
well this guy,
I remember thinking,

2316
01:42:27,411 --> 01:42:30,560
well look in there finally.
You know the Asian people have some

2317
01:42:30,561 --> 01:42:33,710
super fucking bad ass basketball player
other than the giant guy.

2318
01:42:33,740 --> 01:42:36,140
This is what he was doing.
He was like doing the crazy hairstyles

2319
01:42:36,570 --> 01:42:38,960
like dragon ball z out his hair this
year.

2320
01:42:39,080 --> 01:42:40,020
Crazy spiky hair.
Right.

2321
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:40,711
But like,
like I said,

2322
01:42:40,711 --> 01:42:42,540
he's playing in Charlotte,
which is a smaller market.

2323
01:42:42,541 --> 01:42:43,980
So there's lot of people talking about
it.

2324
01:42:44,340 --> 01:42:46,860
When he was playing in La,
which you did a couple of years ago

2325
01:42:47,160 --> 01:42:49,560
after the whole thing happened,
which was a part of getting the Asian

2326
01:42:49,561 --> 01:42:53,010
market into play in the NBA and like the
Lakers and there's a lot of Asian people

2327
01:42:53,011 --> 01:42:55,800
in la that they could get money off of.
So he was in New York,

2328
01:42:55,801 --> 01:42:57,390
he went to La,
played in Houston for a little while,

2329
01:42:57,391 --> 01:42:59,280
but now he's stuck in Charlotte,
which is why you don't hear about them.

2330
01:43:00,060 --> 01:43:03,080
Okay.
Well also he hasn't been set in the

2331
01:43:03,081 --> 01:43:03,800
world on fire.
Right.

2332
01:43:03,800 --> 01:43:05,570
And they're not,
they're not one of the top teams,

2333
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:07,340
but they play against the top teams.
Right?

2334
01:43:07,430 --> 01:43:10,100
Yeah.
So if he was like super awesome,

2335
01:43:10,190 --> 01:43:11,210
you would hear about it.
Right.

2336
01:43:11,211 --> 01:43:13,730
And you still do it.
If you tuned into sports center and see

2337
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:16,220
the top 10 or something like that,
you would hear about his name here and

2338
01:43:16,221 --> 01:43:17,054
there.
Right.

2339
01:43:17,110 --> 01:43:21,140
He's just kind of like four k four k.
What does that mean?

2340
01:43:22,610 --> 01:43:24,350
He's okay.
And that was that fun.

2341
01:43:24,550 --> 01:43:26,890
And that was a hinchcliffe I okay.
Wow.

2342
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:30,830
Why foe soup?
That's Vietnamese.

2343
01:43:30,831 --> 01:43:32,540
He's not Vietnamese.
He was racist.

2344
01:43:32,541 --> 01:43:34,310
And not only that,
I don't think it's pho.

2345
01:43:34,311 --> 01:43:35,850
I think it's really,
you say Fafa.

2346
01:43:36,220 --> 01:43:38,750
Yeah.
Which hey listen,

2347
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:42,830
spell it different.
And why do you think you can get away

2348
01:43:42,831 --> 01:43:47,060
with using our words different?
You know you were over here using all

2349
01:43:47,061 --> 01:43:48,260
language.
Huh?

2350
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:50,660
What'd you get your own fucking way to
say an r?

2351
01:43:50,900 --> 01:43:51,890
So wait,
if it's,

2352
01:43:51,950 --> 01:43:52,220
it's

2353
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:53,230
far.
Yeah.

2354
01:43:53,300 --> 01:43:58,300
So then why do so many of the pho
restaurants always use it as it's like

2355
01:43:58,341 --> 01:44:00,890
pho.
Like cause I know that we're stupid and

2356
01:44:01,120 --> 01:44:03,200
we don't bother researching what the
actual word.

2357
01:44:03,350 --> 01:44:05,510
It's like how many people called the
hoists?

2358
01:44:05,511 --> 01:44:09,530
Gracie Royce Gracie?
Because they were unaware that you have

2359
01:44:09,531 --> 01:44:12,350
to pronounce the r like an h when he's
speaking Portuguese.

2360
01:44:12,380 --> 01:44:15,650
Yeah.
I like how joey has always hundred

2361
01:44:15,650 --> 01:44:20,650
percent says Gyros and I hasta no gyro.
I've been having these fucking gyros

2362
01:44:20,991 --> 01:44:21,824
lately.
Dog.

2363
01:44:22,190 --> 01:44:24,650
Yeah.
Joey Diaz do whatever he wants.

2364
01:44:25,070 --> 01:44:26,600
I liked when he screws up people the
names,

2365
01:44:27,530 --> 01:44:30,520
it's half the fun half the fun.
Where the fuck's dom?

2366
01:44:30,521 --> 01:44:32,930
Irrera plus beer.
I'm was going to text me.

2367
01:44:35,210 --> 01:44:36,830
I was trying to ask you yesterday,
Joe,

2368
01:44:36,831 --> 01:44:38,780
about this facebook camera.
What you thought about it.

2369
01:44:39,350 --> 01:44:43,610
Whoa.
It's 17 cameras put together in one to

2370
01:44:43,611 --> 01:44:45,170
make,
it's called the facebook camera.

2371
01:44:45,171 --> 01:44:45,951
They announced it.
They don't,

2372
01:44:45,951 --> 01:44:47,390
they're not selling it or anything like
that.

2373
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:50,150
It's going to cost 30,000 bucks to put
it all together,

2374
01:44:50,630 --> 01:44:53,630
but supposedly it's going to make
seamless three 60 video.

2375
01:44:54,020 --> 01:44:54,990
Holy Shit.
Uh,

2376
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:56,390
so people can watch it.
The guy that,

2377
01:44:56,830 --> 01:44:58,690
how long before that flies around?

2378
01:44:59,060 --> 01:45:00,440
Yeah.
So if you could put it on a drone,

2379
01:45:00,441 --> 01:45:01,020
that'd be pretty,
yeah

2380
01:45:01,020 --> 01:45:02,670
dude,
that looks like a Ufo.

2381
01:45:03,090 --> 01:45:07,710
I mean this thing that you showing me
right now looks exactly like a classic

2382
01:45:07,711 --> 01:45:10,220
Ufo,
doesn't it?

2383
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:14,880
Like if they could figure out how to,
a way to make that like put some sort of

2384
01:45:14,881 --> 01:45:19,580
a inside fan makes that thing hover and
move around.

2385
01:45:20,150 --> 01:45:20,510
Okay.

2386
01:45:20,510 --> 01:45:22,110
They'll,
they'll looks like a Ufo.

2387
01:45:22,540 --> 01:45:24,660
They,
they sell one that's like that one that

2388
01:45:24,661 --> 01:45:26,670
they sell.
Kind of like at best buy or Amazon

2389
01:45:26,671 --> 01:45:28,410
though.
Like it's the same idea where it just

2390
01:45:28,411 --> 01:45:31,710
records it,
like write it records like a three 60

2391
01:45:31,711 --> 01:45:32,940
thing.
But you can't really do anything with

2392
01:45:32,941 --> 01:45:35,010
the video other than the vr.

2393
01:45:35,050 --> 01:45:36,940
Yeah.
There's a lot of trouble right now going

2394
01:45:36,941 --> 01:45:38,650
into a lot.
When we brought this up the other day,

2395
01:45:38,651 --> 01:45:39,670
a lot of people were asking us,
hey,

2396
01:45:39,671 --> 01:45:41,050
you guys should do it.
It'd be totally awesome,

2397
01:45:41,051 --> 01:45:44,110
which it would be cool for us,
but there's a lot of hurdles to get to.

2398
01:45:44,150 --> 01:45:45,410
Well,
you had a real good point too.

2399
01:45:45,411 --> 01:45:46,880
We said,
remember when people are going,

2400
01:45:46,881 --> 01:45:48,740
how come everything,
is it on three D tv?

2401
01:45:49,010 --> 01:45:52,040
What about three d TV while you're doing
your show on three d tv now try to find

2402
01:45:52,041 --> 01:45:53,600
a three D tv.
Nobody has one.

2403
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:56,550
The Three d broadcasting was still
probably only did twice.

2404
01:45:56,670 --> 01:45:57,660
It's not ready.
Yeah,

2405
01:45:57,810 --> 01:46:00,960
none of that stuff's ready.
But I think it's going to be like oculus

2406
01:46:00,961 --> 01:46:03,270
rift.
Like it wasn't ready until it's ready.

2407
01:46:03,570 --> 01:46:05,100
You know,
like for the longest time when we were

2408
01:46:05,101 --> 01:46:07,530
kids,
virtual reality was a thing like there

2409
01:46:07,531 --> 01:46:09,720
was even a movie.
Where was it?

2410
01:46:09,721 --> 01:46:11,240
Lawnmower man.
Oh Man.

2411
01:46:11,250 --> 01:46:13,250
Yeah.
I mean it was based on like we thought,

2412
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:15,480
oh my God,
any day now we're going to be in virtual

2413
01:46:15,481 --> 01:46:18,090
reality.
And it never took place because the

2414
01:46:18,091 --> 01:46:20,910
computing power and the graphics and
everything just wasn't ready.

2415
01:46:21,120 --> 01:46:24,840
But now that it is ready,
like that invidia demonstration that

2416
01:46:24,841 --> 01:46:28,360
they did with all the crazy shit that
you can do with a,

2417
01:46:28,810 --> 01:46:32,070
um,
with virtual reality and those a oculus

2418
01:46:32,071 --> 01:46:35,610
rift goggles.
What is that dude from of iron man that

2419
01:46:35,611 --> 01:46:38,820
his lawnmower man really?
Was it that cheesy looking?

2420
01:46:38,821 --> 01:46:39,640
Yeah.
Yeah.

2421
01:46:39,640 --> 01:46:42,750
No,
it used the same animators from beyond

2422
01:46:42,751 --> 01:46:43,320
the mind's eye.

2423
01:46:43,320 --> 01:46:46,410
If you ever watched that,
that guy that was in lawnmower man,

2424
01:46:46,440 --> 01:46:49,140
the guy on the right,
that dude was in a bunch of movies.

2425
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:53,460
He was one of those movie stars and I
don't remember his name.

2426
01:46:53,860 --> 01:46:54,960
Yeah,
I don't know who he is,

2427
01:46:54,961 --> 01:46:59,100
but that guy was in some big ass movies.
He was always like the creepy guy.

2428
01:47:00,570 --> 01:47:03,450
He's one of those dudes like the dude,
where's my car guy?

2429
01:47:03,970 --> 01:47:07,080
I like after he's not doing that,
those movies anymore,

2430
01:47:07,110 --> 01:47:08,310
it becomes like,
hey,

2431
01:47:08,311 --> 01:47:09,960
or American pie.
The American Pie.

2432
01:47:10,180 --> 01:47:11,280
Yeah.
What's l?

2433
01:47:11,310 --> 01:47:12,480
Jeff Leahy.
Well,

2434
01:47:12,510 --> 01:47:15,360
he's actually pretty famous.
I remember his name.

2435
01:47:15,390 --> 01:47:16,710
It's just me.
I forgot his name.

2436
01:47:16,711 --> 01:47:19,710
That guy has been in everything though.
Talking about stiffler.

2437
01:47:20,120 --> 01:47:20,910
Yeah.
Stiffer.

2438
01:47:20,910 --> 01:47:22,170
Yeah.
What happened and stuff.

2439
01:47:22,171 --> 01:47:24,450
Like I just saw the video on him
yesterday and why he hasn't been

2440
01:47:24,451 --> 01:47:27,120
marketed.
He just had a couple quote unquote bad

2441
01:47:27,121 --> 01:47:29,010
roles,
if you will over the movies failed where

2442
01:47:29,011 --> 01:47:31,470
he was like a leading man,
but he's been in all the ice age movies.

2443
01:47:31,471 --> 01:47:32,670
He's still doing pretty well for
himself,

2444
01:47:32,671 --> 01:47:34,080
I'm sure.
Oh,

2445
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:36,610
nice feel good moment,
Jamie.

2446
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:38,040
Beautiful.
All right.

2447
01:47:38,041 --> 01:47:40,560
Dom Arrera is going to be here next.
We're going to pause this bitch for a

2448
01:47:40,561 --> 01:47:43,290

Arrera uh,

2449
01:47:43,291 --> 01:47:47,130

brought in.

2450
01:47:47,131 --> 01:47:48,240
How long are they for sale for

2451
01:47:48,340 --> 01:47:50,350

They've just got a new shipment in,

Go check that shit out.
Desk squad died.

2461
01:48:17,741 --> 01:48:19,930
TV.
Brian is red ban on twitter.

2462
01:48:20,140 --> 01:48:23,920
Young Jamie for some reason has not
taken the young Jamie twitter name.

2463
01:48:24,040 --> 01:48:26,250
I have it.
It's just I decided not to use it there.

2464
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:29,710
Nonsense seems silly.
It is your name.

2465
01:48:29,890 --> 01:48:31,210
You are young.
Jamie.

2466
01:48:31,420 --> 01:48:33,160
Someday you're going to be bag.
Bertrand Russell,

2467
01:48:33,161 --> 01:48:37,330
they called me young Jamie,
and for the first 50 years I resisted.

2468
01:48:37,331 --> 01:48:40,600
The mom gets stuck with the young for my
whole life and it will be you are young,

2469
01:48:40,601 --> 01:48:42,400
Jamie.
That's who you are,

2470
01:48:42,401 --> 01:48:42,911
bro.
Take it.

2471
01:48:42,911 --> 01:48:43,541
I'll take,
okay.

2472
01:48:43,541 --> 01:48:45,340
It's a good name.
You're a handsome fella.

2473
01:48:46,040 --> 01:48:46,841
All right,
fuckers.

2474
01:48:46,841 --> 01:48:49,270
We'll be back in a little bit with the
Great Dom Irrera

2475
01:48:56,360 --> 01:48:57,030
okay.

2476
01:48:57,030 --> 01:48:57,863
Hmm.

2477
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:01,440
Okay.
