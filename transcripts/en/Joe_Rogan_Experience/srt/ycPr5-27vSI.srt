1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,720
Ah Ha ha.
Four,

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,250
three,
two,

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,140
one.
Boom.

4
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,060
Thank you.
Thanks for doing this man.

5
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:09,960
Really appreciate it.
Hey,

6
00:00:09,961 --> 00:00:11,100
welcome.
It's very good to meet you.

7
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,200
Nice to meet you too.
And thanks for not letting this place on

8
00:00:13,201 --> 00:00:14,250
fire.
You're welcome.

9
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,010
Later.
How does one,

10
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,680
I'm just in the middle of doing all the 
things you do,

11
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:25,010
create cars or rockets,
all this stuff you're doing constantly 

12
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,870
innovating,
decided to just make a flame thrower.

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,240
Where do you have time for that?
Well,

14
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:36,270
the famous Edwin,
we didn't put a lot of time into the 

15
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:36,270
flame thrower,
the,

16
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,030
this was an off the cuff thing and um,
so have sort of like sort of a sort of a

17
00:00:42,341 --> 00:00:47,341
hobby company called the boring company 
which started out as a joke and we 

18
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,930
decided to make a real um,
and,

19
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:56,110
and dig a tunnel under la and then dig.
Then people,

20
00:00:56,111 --> 00:01:01,111
other people asked us to dig tunnels and
so we said yes in a few cases and then 

21
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:07,930
we have a merchandise section that only 
has one piece of merchandise at a time.

22
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,330
And we started off with a cap and there 
was only one thing on,

23
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:16,270
it was just boring company.com/cap
or hat.

24
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,810
That's it.
And then we sold the hats,

25
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,690
limited limited edition,
it just said the boring company.

26
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:28,830
And then I'm big kind of space,
both the movie and in spaceballs yogurt 

27
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:37,230
goes through the merchandising section 
and they have a flame thrower in the 

28
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:42,481
merchandising section of spaceballs.
And like the kids love that one.

29
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,730
That's the line of when he pulls up the 
claim for.

30
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,460
It's like we should do a flame thrower.
So we.

31
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,720
Does anybody tell,
you know,

32
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,730
does anybody go elan,
um,

33
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,970
maybe for yourself,
but selling a flame thrower,

34
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:05,080
the liabilities,
all the people you're selling this 

35
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,841
device to what kind of unhinged people 
are going to be buying a flame thrower 

36
00:02:07,841 --> 00:02:10,130
in the first place to really want to 
connect ourselves to all these potential

37
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:12,860
arsonists yeah.
It's a terrible idea.

38
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,370
Terrible by one.
I said,

39
00:02:16,371 --> 00:02:20,210
don't buy this flame thrower to buy it.
Don't buy it.

40
00:02:20,211 --> 00:02:22,730
That's what I said a bit.
Still people bought it.

41
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,640
Yeah.
There's nothing I can do to stop them.

42
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,170
You build them.
I said,

43
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,030
don't buy it.
It's a bad idea.

44
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,610
How many did you make your w?
It's dangerous.

45
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,560
It's got,
it's wrong.

46
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,220
Don't buy it.
People bought it.

47
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,260
I just couldn't stop them.
How many did you make?

48
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:45,190
$20,000
and they're all gone in three,

49
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,230
I think four days.
It sold out in four days.

50
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,250
Are you going to do another run?

51
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,730
No,
now let's it.

52
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,060
Yes.
Oh,

53
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,200
I said,
well do 20 that we did $50,000.

54
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,340
40,000
hats.

55
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,680
I'm at.
And,

56
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:07,740
and um,
that was a million dollars and he's 

57
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:07,740
like,
okay,

58
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,941
well we'll sell something for 10 million
and that was 20,000

59
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:17,251
flame throwers at $500 each.
They went fast.

60
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:23,940
Yeah.
How do you have the time to do that 

61
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:23,940
though?
I mean,

62
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,181
I understand that it's not a big deal in
terms of all the other things that you 

63
00:03:27,181 --> 00:03:27,181
do,
but how do you have time to do anything?

64
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:32,190
I just,
I don't understand your time management 

65
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:32,190
skills.
I mean,

66
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,810
I didn't spend much time on this flame 
thrower.

67
00:03:34,811 --> 00:03:36,400
I mean,
to be totally frank,

68
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:39,370
it's actually just a roofing torch with 
an air rifle cover.

69
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:46,020
It's not a real flame thrower,
which is why it says not a flame 

70
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:46,690
thrower.
That's why we were very clear.

71
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,750
This is not actually a flame thrower 
and,

72
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:53,850
and,
and it also were told that various 

73
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:54,720
countries were,
were banned shipping of it would,

74
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,230
they would,
they would band flame throwers.

75
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:00,820
So we've got to solve this problem for 
the customs agencies.

76
00:04:00,821 --> 00:04:04,260
We labeled it not a flame thrower.
That work.

77
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,670
Is it effective?
I don't know.

78
00:04:06,671 --> 00:04:07,340
I think so,
yes.

79
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,200
So far,
yes.

80
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:13,530
Now,
but you just said you cannot serve a 

81
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,601
flame thrower,
but you do so many different things and 

82
00:04:15,601 --> 00:04:16,570
forget about the flame thrower.
Like how do you do all that other shit?

83
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:17,080
I'm like,
how do you,

84
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:21,100
how do you,
how does one decide to fix la traffic by

85
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:23,980
drilling holes in the ground and who do 
you even approach with that?

86
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,470
Like when you have this idea,
who do you talk to about that?

87
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:32,370
I mean,
I'm not saying it's going to be 

88
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:32,370
successful or so,
you know,

89
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:32,380
I know it's just like asserting that 
it's going to be successful,

90
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,800
but so far I've lived in La for 16 years
and the traffic has always been terrible

91
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,110
and so I don't see any other ideas for 
improving the traffic.

92
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:52,260
Um,
so in desperation where you're going to 

93
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,280
dig a tunnel and maybe that tunnel will 
be successful and maybe it won't.

94
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,910
I'm,
I'm listening.

95
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:06,260
Yeah.
I'm not trying to convince you it's 

96
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:06,260
going to work.
And are the people that you or anyone.

97
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,300
But you were starting this though.
This is actually a project you're 

98
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:11,300
starting to implement,
right?

99
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:11,850
Yeah.
No,

100
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:16,000
we've dug about a mile.
It's quite long.

101
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:18,040
Take.
Takes a long time to Wolcott yeah.

102
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,320
Now when you do in this,
what,

103
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,360
what is the ultimate plan?
The ultimate plan is to have these in 

104
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,330
major cities in anywhere.
There's mass congestion and just try it 

105
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:27,330
out in la first.
Yeah,

106
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:31,000
it's,
it's in La because I mostly live in la.

107
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,820
That's the reason as a terrible place to
dig tunnels.

108
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,400
This is one of the worst places.
Dig Tunnels,

109
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:40,360
because the does mostly because of the 
paperwork you will think.

110
00:05:40,361 --> 00:05:45,361
It's like,
what about seismic is actually both 

111
00:05:45,361 --> 00:05:46,180
tunnels are very safe in earthquakes.
Why's that?

112
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:52,330
Earthquakes.
Earthquakes are essentially of surface 

113
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:52,840
phenomenon.
It's like waves on the ocean.

114
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,660
So if,
if,

115
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,940
if,
if there's a storm,

116
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,040
you want to be on the,
on in a submarine.

117
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,160
So being in a tunnel,
it's like being in a submarine.

118
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:06,670
Now the way the towels construct is,
it's constructed out of these 

119
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:07,790
interlocking segments,
kind of like a snake.

120
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:13,250
Um,
it's sort of like a snake exoskeleton 

121
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:17,650
with a double seals.
And so even when the ground moves,

122
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:23,380
the it's able to,
the tunnel actually is able to shift 

123
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:26,740
along with the ground like an 
underground snake and it doesn't crack 

124
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,750
or break or,
or,

125
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,300
and,
and,

126
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:32,630
and it's extremely unlikely that both 
seals would be broken and it's,

127
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:37,690
it's,
it's a capable of taking five 

128
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:38,390
atmospheres of pressure.
It's waterproof.

129
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:42,290
Methane proof will gas proof of any kind
and,

130
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:47,380
uh,
meets old California seismic 

131
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:47,380
requirements.
So when you have this idea,

132
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:47,870
who do you bring this to?

133
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,340
I'm not sure what you mean by that.
Well when you,

134
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,720
you're,
you're implementing it,

135
00:06:53,721 --> 00:06:58,721
so you're digging holes in the ground 
like you have to bring it to someone 

136
00:06:58,721 --> 00:06:58,721
that lets you do it.

137
00:06:58,721 --> 00:06:58,721
Yeah.
So,

138
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,810
um,
there were,

139
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,300
there were some engineers from space x,
um,

140
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:10,590
who were,
who thought it would be cool to do this 

141
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,610
and the guy runs it like day to day.
Steve Davis,

142
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,850
he's long,
longtime space x engineer.

143
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,780
He's great.
Um,

144
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:23,440
so steve was like,
I like to help make this happen.

145
00:07:23,441 --> 00:07:24,100
He was like,
cool.

146
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:28,930
And so we started off with digging a 
hole in the ground.

147
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,380
It's got like a permit for a pit,
a pit,

148
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,360
and just dug a big pit.

149
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:37,100
Do you have to tell them what the pits 
for or you just say,

150
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,240
hey,
we just want to dig a hole.

151
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,820
Nice.
Fill out this form.

152
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,480
That's it.
Yeah,

153
00:07:43,481 --> 00:07:44,740
it was a in our parking lot.

154
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:50,190
And,
but do you have to give them some sort 

155
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:50,470
of a blueprint for your ultimate idea?
And do they have to approve it?

156
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,340
Like how does that work

157
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:56,620
now?
We just started off with a pit big pit 

158
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:56,810
and I'm like,
you don't,

159
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:57,970
there's not really,
you know,

160
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:02,090
they don't really care about the 
existential nature of a pit.

161
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,340
You just say like,
I don't want a pit,

162
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,280
right?
Yeah.

163
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:09,640
And a hole in the ground.
So then we got the permit for the pit 

164
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:15,280
and we dug the pit and we dug it in like
three days,

165
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,290
two,
three days actually to 48 hours,

166
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,930
something like that.
Um,

167
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:22,330
cause uh,
Eric are steady,

168
00:08:22,331 --> 00:08:27,331
was coming by for the hype to,
was going to attend the hyperloop 

169
00:08:27,331 --> 00:08:27,500
competition,
which like a student competition we have

170
00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:31,040
for a who can make the fastest pod in 
the hyperloop.

171
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,320
And uh,
he was coming.

172
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,840
This was get the files are going to be 
on Sunday afternoon.

173
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:37,560
And so,
uh,

174
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,230
Eric was coming by on Sunday afternoon.
He's like,

175
00:08:39,231 --> 00:08:40,850
you know,
we should take this pit.

176
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,560
And then like,
sure.

177
00:08:41,561 --> 00:08:42,920
Eric.
Uh,

178
00:08:42,921 --> 00:08:47,060
so we was like Friday morning and then 
yeah.

179
00:08:47,061 --> 00:08:50,090
So it was about a little over 40 hours.
Forty hours later we dug the pit.

180
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:54,380
There's like when 24 slash seven or 24 
or 48 straight hours,

181
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:59,590
something like and dug this big pit and,
and,

182
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:03,000
and we're like showed eric the pit.
It's like obviously it's just a pit,

183
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:11,130
but hey,
it's holding the ground is better than 

184
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,351
no hole in the ground.
And what do you tell them about this 

185
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:13,351
pit?
I mean just said this is the starting of

186
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:13,690
this idea.
Yes,

187
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:18,740
we're going to build tunnels under la to
help funnel traffic better and their 

188
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:18,940
girls and they just go,
okay.

189
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,810
That we've joked around about this in 
the podcast before too,

190
00:09:22,811 --> 00:09:26,020
like what are the person can go to the 
people that run the city and go,

191
00:09:26,021 --> 00:09:31,021
hey,
we're going to dig some holes on the 

192
00:09:31,021 --> 00:09:31,021
ground and puts him tunnels in there.
And they go,

193
00:09:31,021 --> 00:09:31,021
oh yeah,
okay.

194
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:36,260
Now I know where the hole in the ground,
but it's people dig holes in the ground 

195
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:36,260
all the time.
But.

196
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:36,530
But my,
my question is like,

197
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:40,240
I know how much time you must be 
spending on your Tesla factory.

198
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:45,420
I know how much time you must be 
spending on space x and yet you still 

199
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,141
have time to dig holes under the ground 
in La and come up with these ideas and 

200
00:09:49,141 --> 00:09:49,210
then implement them.
Like,

201
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,350
I've got a million ideas.
I'm sure you just.

202
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:51,870
No shortage.

203
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:53,700
Yeah,

204
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,510
I just don't know how you manage your 
time.

205
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:56,920
I don't understand it.
It doesn't seem.

206
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,200
It doesn't even seem humanly possible.

207
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,550
You know,
I,

208
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,140
I do.
Basically.

209
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:06,410
I think people like don't totally 
understand what I do with my time.

210
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:10,250
They think like I'm a business guy or 
something like that.

211
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:13,010
I'm like,
my wikipedia page says,

212
00:10:13,011 --> 00:10:14,990
business magnate.
What would you call yourself?

213
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:16,880
A business magnet.

214
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,630
Please change my wikipedia page to 
magnet.

215
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,070
They'll change right now.
He's probably already changed.

216
00:10:23,071 --> 00:10:28,071
It's locked.
So somebody has to be able to unlock it 

217
00:10:28,071 --> 00:10:28,071
and change it to magnus.

218
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,930
Um,
no.

219
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:35,060
I,
I do engineering and manufacturing and 

220
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:39,341
that kind of thing.
That's like 80 percent or more of my 

221
00:10:39,341 --> 00:10:39,341
time

222
00:10:39,341 --> 00:10:42,570
ideas.
And then the implementation of those 

223
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:42,570
ideas.

224
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:42,570
Yes.
That was like hardcore engineering,

225
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:45,090
like designing things,
right?

226
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,970
Structural,
mechanical,

227
00:10:48,971 --> 00:10:50,590
electrical,
software,

228
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:54,820
a user interface,
engineering,

229
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:55,810
aerospace,
engineering.

230
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,170
But you must understand there's not a 
whole lot of human beings like you.

231
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,140
You know that right?
To your an audit teams?

232
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,730
Yes.
To chimps.

233
00:11:03,731 --> 00:11:05,800
Like me,
we're all chimps.

234
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:06,640
Yeah,
we are.

235
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,230
We're wanting to watch one notch above a
chimp.

236
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:13,380
Some of us are a little more confused.
When I watched you doing all these 

237
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,141
things and I'm like,
how is this motherfucker have all this 

238
00:11:16,141 --> 00:11:17,440
time and all this energy and all these 
ideas,

239
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,090
and then people just let them do these 
things

240
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,380
because I'm an alien.

241
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,560
That's what I've speculated.
Yes.

242
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,060
I'm on record saying this in the past.
I wonder.

243
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,980
It's true.
I mean if there was one,

244
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,040
I was like,
if there was like maybe an intelligent 

245
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,260
being that we created some ai creature 
that's a superior to people,

246
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:42,500
maybe they just hang around with us for 
a little while like you've been doing 

247
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,750
and then fix a bunch of shit.
Maybe that's the way my tufts on 

248
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,320
retainer or something like that.
You might.

249
00:11:46,321 --> 00:11:47,530
Do you think you do?
Probably.

250
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,740
Do you wonder like you around normal 
people,

251
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:50,370
you're like,
hmm.

252
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,960
Think what's up with these boring dumb 
mother fuckers ever?

253
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:01,350
Not Bad for a human,
but I think it will not be able to hold 

254
00:12:03,371 --> 00:12:04,390
a candle to ai.

255
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:09,790
Hm.
You scare the shit out of me when you 

256
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:09,790
talk about Ai between you and Sam 
Harris.

257
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:14,300
Sure.
Consider it until at a podcast with Sam 

258
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:14,300
wants.
That's great.

259
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,490
He made me Shit my pants.
Talking about Ai,

260
00:12:16,491 --> 00:12:21,491
I realized like,
oh well this is a genie that wants out 

261
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:21,491
of the bottle.
You never get it back in.

262
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,030
That's true.
There was a video that you tweeted about

263
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,480
one of those Boston dynamic robots,
like in the future it will be moving so 

264
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,670
fast you can't see it without a strobe 
light.

265
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:41,130
You could probably do that right now and
no one's really paying attention too 

266
00:12:41,271 --> 00:12:46,271
much.
Other than people like you or people 

267
00:12:46,271 --> 00:12:46,271
that are really obsessed with 
technology.

268
00:12:46,271 --> 00:12:48,550
All these things are happening and these
robots or did you see the one where it.

269
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,920
Peta put out a statement that you 
shouldn't kick robots.

270
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:57,680
It's probably not wise for retribution 
that their memory is pretty good.

271
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,270
I bet.
It's really good.

272
00:12:59,271 --> 00:13:00,680
It's really good.
I bet it is.

273
00:13:00,681 --> 00:13:02,150
Yes,
and getting better every day.

274
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,370
It's really.
Are you honestly,

275
00:13:04,371 --> 00:13:07,760
legitimately concerned about this?
Are you the AI,

276
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:12,050
one of your main worries in regards to 
the future?

277
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,410
Yes,
it,

278
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:22,890
it's less of a worry than it used to be 
a mostly due to taking more of a 

279
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,120
fatalistic attitude.

280
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:30,490
Hm.
So you used to have more hope and you 

281
00:13:30,621 --> 00:13:35,621
gave up some of it and now you don't 
worry as much about ai you like this is 

282
00:13:35,621 --> 00:13:35,870
just what it is.

283
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:39,100
Yeah,

284
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,930
pretty much,
yes.

285
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,450
But no,
it's not necessarily bad.

286
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:52,130
It's just,
it's definitely going to be outside of 

287
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:52,500
human control.
Not necessarily bad,

288
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,180
right?
Yeah,

289
00:13:53,181 --> 00:13:54,600
it's not,
it's not necessarily bad,

290
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:57,660
it's just,
it's just outside of human control.

291
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,720
Now the thing that's going to be tricky 
here is that it's going to be very 

292
00:14:03,511 --> 00:14:07,710
tempting to use ai as a weapon.
That's going to be very tempting in fact

293
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,430
will be used as a weapon.
Um,

294
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,910
so the,
the,

295
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,040
the,
the onramp to serious ai,

296
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:23,520
the danger is going to be more humans 
using it against each other.

297
00:14:23,521 --> 00:14:27,300
I think most likely that'll be the 
danger.

298
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:28,470
Yeah.

299
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:33,580
How far do you think we are from 
something that can make its own mind up,

300
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:38,610
whether or not something's ethically or 
morally correct or they're not at wants 

301
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:39,370
to do something or whether or not he 
wants to improve itself,

302
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:43,690
whether or not it wants to protect 
itself from people or from other Ai.

303
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:46,690
How far away we suffer from something 
that's really truly sent you in?

304
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:56,180
Well,
I mean you could argue that any group of

305
00:14:56,210 --> 00:15:01,210
people like like a company is 
essentially a cybernetic collective of 

306
00:15:03,171 --> 00:15:06,470
people and machines.
That's what a company is

307
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:14,350
and then there are different.
There's different levels of complexity 

308
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:19,880
in the way these companies are formed 
and then there are sort of.

309
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:25,910
There's this like a collective ai in,
in the google sort of search,

310
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:31,540
Google search,
you know the where we're all sort of 

311
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,200
plugged in as like,
like nodes on the network,

312
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:39,040
like leaves on a big tree or in rural 
rural feeding this network with our 

313
00:15:40,911 --> 00:15:45,911
questions and answers all collectively 
programming the ai and the the and 

314
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,920
Google plus the older humans that 
connect to it are one giant cybernetic 

315
00:15:54,351 --> 00:15:59,351
collective.
This is also true of facebook and 

316
00:15:59,351 --> 00:16:00,980
twitter and instagram and all these 
sorts of networks.

317
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,220
The dryness.
I haven't had a collectives.

318
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,190
Humans and electronics all interfacing 
and constantly.

319
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,360
Constantly connected.

320
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,970
Yes,
constantly.

321
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:20,290
One of the things that I have been 
thinking about a lot over the last few 

322
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:23,650
years is that one of the things that 
drives a lot of people crazy is how how 

323
00:16:23,661 --> 00:16:28,661
many people are obsessed with 
materialism and getting the latest 

324
00:16:28,661 --> 00:16:29,750
greatest thing and I wonder how much of 
that is.

325
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:35,780
Well,
a lot of it is most certainly fueling 

326
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,601
technology and innovation.
It almost seems like it's built into us 

327
00:16:37,601 --> 00:16:41,790
to like what we like and what we want,
that we're fueling this thing that's 

328
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:45,701
constantly around us all the time and it
doesn't seem possible that people are 

329
00:16:45,701 --> 00:16:48,911
going to pump the brakes.
It doesn't seem possible at this stage 

330
00:16:48,911 --> 00:16:49,700
where we're constantly adding new cell 
phone,

331
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:52,530
the latest Tesla update the newest 
macbook pro,

332
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:57,540
but everything has to be newer and 
better and that's going to lead to some 

333
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,070
incredible point and it seems like it's 
built into us.

334
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,240
It almost seems like it's an instinct 
that we were working towards this,

335
00:17:08,241 --> 00:17:12,560
that we'd like it our job,
just like the ants build the ant hill.

336
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,750
Our job is to somehow or another fuel 
this.

337
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:23,010
Yes,
I made those comments some some years 

338
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:27,690
ago,
but it feels like we are the biological 

339
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:30,631
bootloader for ai.
Effectively we are building it and then 

340
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:37,080
we're building progressively greater 
intelligence and the percentage of 

341
00:17:38,831 --> 00:17:43,831
intelligence that is not human is 
increasing and eventually we will 

342
00:17:44,621 --> 00:17:47,170
represent a very small percentage of 
intelligence.

343
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:55,440
But the,
the AI isn't formed strangely by the 

344
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,731
human limbic system.
It is in large part our ed writ large.

345
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,270
How so?
Well,

346
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:08,290
you mentioned all those things,
the sort of primal drives.

347
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:14,580
Um,
that's all old things that we like and 

348
00:18:16,091 --> 00:18:21,091
hate and fear.
They're all there on the internet,

349
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:24,460
their projection of our limbic system.

350
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:33,250
That's true.
Hey,

351
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,270
no,
it makes sense.

352
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:38,880
Then the thinking of it as a.
let me think of thinking of corporations

353
00:18:38,881 --> 00:18:43,881
and just thinking of just human beings 
communicating online through these 

354
00:18:43,881 --> 00:18:43,881
social media networks as some sort of an
organism.

355
00:18:43,881 --> 00:18:45,910
That's a,
it's a Cyborg.

356
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:51,710
It's a combination.
It's a combination of electronics and 

357
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:51,710
biology.
Yeah.

358
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:54,820
This is in some,
in some measure,

359
00:18:55,090 --> 00:19:00,090
the success of these online systems is 
that is sort of a function of,

360
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:08,160
of how much limbic resonance they're 
able to achieve with people.

361
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:12,400
The more limbic resonance,
the more engagement.

362
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:13,940
MMM.

363
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:20,160
Whereas like one of the reasons why 
probably instagram is more enticing than

364
00:19:20,161 --> 00:19:22,350
twitter.
Limbic resonance.

365
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,810
Yeah.
You get more images,

366
00:19:24,811 --> 00:19:26,090
more video.
Yes.

367
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,230
Tweaking your system more.
Yes.

368
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,680
Do you worry about or wonder in fact of 
what the next step is?

369
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:37,750
Me.
A lot of people didn't see twitter 

370
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:37,750
coming that,
you know,

371
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,250
communicating with 140 characters or 280
now would be a thing that people would 

372
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:44,460
be interested in.
Like it's going to excel.

373
00:19:44,461 --> 00:19:46,500
It's gonna become more connected to us,
right?

374
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:54,260
Yes.
Things are getting more and more 

375
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:54,260
connected there at this point,
constrained by bandwidth.

376
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:59,160
Our input output is low,
particularly output after got worse with

377
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:01,860
thumbs and where you sort of input with 
10,

378
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:06,950
10 fingers now if thumbs,
but images are just are also other way 

379
00:20:08,161 --> 00:20:13,161
of communicating at high bandwidth.
Take pictures and you send pictures 

380
00:20:13,161 --> 00:20:15,060
people sends.
That's,

381
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:18,290
that communicates far more information 
than you can communicate with them.

382
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:23,500
So what happened with you where you 
decided or you took on a more fatalistic

383
00:20:23,501 --> 00:20:24,730
attitude,
like what?

384
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:28,150
Was there any specific thing or was it 
just the inevitability of our future?

385
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,720
I tried to convince people to slow down,
slow down ai to regulate ai.

386
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:49,900
This was few I tried for years.

387
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,720
See Nobody listened to in a movie.
Robots.

388
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,140
Good fucking take over and you're 
freaking me out.

389
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,000
Nobody listened.
Nobody listens.

390
00:20:58,001 --> 00:21:00,910
No one are people more inclined to 
listen today.

391
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:05,940
It seems like an issue that's brought up
more often over the last few years than 

392
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,880
it was maybe five,
10 years ago.

393
00:21:06,881 --> 00:21:08,290
It seemed like science fiction,

394
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:13,430
maybe they will.
So far they haven't.

395
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,200
I think people don't like the.
Normally.

396
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,110
The way the regulations work,
it was very slow,

397
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:26,920
very slow indeed.
So usually it'll be something.

398
00:21:28,551 --> 00:21:33,470
Some of your technology will cause 
damage or death.

399
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,930
There will be an outcry.
They will be an investigation.

400
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:44,100
You guys will pass.
There will be some sort of insights 

401
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:48,490
committee.
They will be rulemaking than there will 

402
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:48,920
be oversight.
Eventually regulations.

403
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:53,450
This all takes many years.
This is the normal course of things.

404
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,540
If you look at say what a motive 
regulations,

405
00:21:56,541 --> 00:22:01,541
how long did it take for seat belts to 
be implemented to be required?

406
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:04,430
Know the auto industry,
fought seat belts,

407
00:22:04,431 --> 00:22:09,431
I think for more than a decade,
successfully fought any regulations on 

408
00:22:10,251 --> 00:22:15,251
seat belts,
even though the numbers were extremely 

409
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,060
obvious.
If you had a seatbelt on,

410
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:22,770
you will be far less likely to die.
It will be certainly entered was 

411
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:26,650
unequivocal and the industry fought this
for years successfully.

412
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:33,140
Eventually after many,
many people died.

413
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:40,180
Regulators insisted on seatbelts.
This is a.

414
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:46,940
This timeframe is not relevant to ai.
You can't take 10 years from the point 

415
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,970
at which is dangerous,
so late

416
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:56,550
and you feel like this is decades away 
or years away from being too late.

417
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,730
If you have this fatalistic attitude and
you feel like it's going,

418
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:06,900
we're in a,
almost like a doomsday countdown.

419
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,420
It's not necessarily a doomsday 
countdown.

420
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:11,700
It's,
it's a out of control.

421
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:12,220
Countdown

422
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:13,220
control.
Yeah.

423
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:17,660
People call it the singularity and uh,
that's,

424
00:23:17,661 --> 00:23:18,680
that's probably a good way to think 
about it.

425
00:23:18,681 --> 00:23:19,470
Just,
it's a singular.

426
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:23,660
It's hard to predict like a black hole,
what happens past the event horizon?

427
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,780
Right?
Sort of once it's implemented,

428
00:23:25,781 --> 00:23:28,210
it's very different because it wants to 
get out of the bottle,

429
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:31,720
what's going to happen and it will be 
able to improve itself.

430
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,470
Pro.
Yes.

431
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,480
That's where it gets spooky,
right?

432
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:38,870
The idea that it can do thousands of 
years of innovation.

433
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,370
We're very,
very quickly.

434
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,100
Yeah.
And then we'll be just ridiculous.

435
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:49,430
Ridiculous.
We will be like this ridiculous 

436
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:51,770
biological shitting pissing thing trying
to stop the gods now stop.

437
00:23:51,771 --> 00:23:56,771
We like,
we like living with a finite lifespan 

438
00:23:56,771 --> 00:23:56,771
and watching,
you know,

439
00:23:56,771 --> 00:23:56,990
Norman Rockwell paintings.

440
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,710
It could be terrible and it could be 
great.

441
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,020
It's not clear.
Right.

442
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,320
But one thing is for sure we will not 
control it.

443
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:12,940
Do you think that it's likely that we 
will merge somehow or another with this 

444
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:18,580
sort of technology and it will augment 
what we are now or do you think it will 

445
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,070
replace us?

446
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:28,930
Well,
that's the scenario that the merge 

447
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:31,361
scenario with ai is the one that seems 
like probably the best.

448
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,340
Like us.
Yes.

449
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,340
Like if you,
if you can't beat it,

450
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:39,680
join it.
That's.

451
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:41,940
Yeah,
you know,

452
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:47,430
um,
so from a longterm existential 

453
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:53,720
standpoint,
that's like the purpose of neuro link is

454
00:24:53,721 --> 00:24:58,721
to create a high bandwidth interface to 
the brain such that we can be somebody 

455
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:06,110
with ai because we have a bandwidth 
problem that you just can't communicate 

456
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:10,781
through.
Your fingers is too slow and whereas 

457
00:25:10,781 --> 00:25:11,000
neural link at right now,

458
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:18,310
I think we'll have something interesting
to announce in a few months that's at 

459
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,430
least an order of magnitude better than 
anything else.

460
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:23,060
Probably I think better than anyone 
thinks is possible.

461
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,830
How much can you talk about that right 
now?

462
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,620
I don't want to jump the gun on that.
Um,

463
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:30,920
but what's like the ultimate,
what's,

464
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:36,100
what's the idea behind it?
Like what are you trying to accomplish 

465
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,591
with it?
Like what would you like best case 

466
00:25:38,591 --> 00:25:40,631
scenario?
I think best case scenario we 

467
00:25:40,631 --> 00:25:45,400
effectively merge with ai where we ais 
serves as a tertiary cognition layer 

468
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:53,120
where we've got the limbic system.
I'm kind of the primitive brain.

469
00:25:53,121 --> 00:25:55,490
Essentially.
You've got the Cortex,

470
00:25:55,580 --> 00:26:00,140
so you're currently in a symbiotic 
relationship with your cortex and limbic

471
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:05,141
system are in a symbiotic relationship 
and generally people like their cortex 

472
00:26:05,141 --> 00:26:07,550
and they liked the limbic system.
I haven't met anyone who wants to delete

473
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,320
their limbic system or delete their 
cortex.

474
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:14,800
Everybody seems to have like both and 
the cortex is mostly in service to the 

475
00:26:15,621 --> 00:26:19,090
limbic system.
People may think that that,

476
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,040
that they're,
that they're thinking part of themselves

477
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:27,041
isn't charged,
but it's mostly their limbic system 

478
00:26:27,041 --> 00:26:28,310
that's in charge and the cortex is 
trying to make the limbic system happy.

479
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:31,610
That's what most of that computing power
is,

480
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:35,810
aren't towards how can I make the limbic
system happy?

481
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,050
That's what I'm trying to do.
Now.

482
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:43,770
If we do have a third layer,
which is the ai extension yourself,

483
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:47,010
that is also some biotic,
um,

484
00:26:47,011 --> 00:26:52,011
and there's enough bandwidth between the
cortex and the ai extension of yourself 

485
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:56,880
such that the ai doesn't defacto 
separate,

486
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:03,110
then that could be a good outcome.
That could be quite a positive outcome 

487
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:05,100
for the future.
So instead of replacing us,

488
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,680
it will radically change our 
capabilities.

489
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,540
Yes,
it will.

490
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:14,630
It will enable anyone who wants to have 
super human cognition.

491
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:24,850
Anyone who wants this is not a matter of
earning power because you're earning 

492
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:25,580
power would be vastly greater after you 
do it.

493
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:30,670
So it's just like anyone who wants to 
can just do it in theory.

494
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,680
That's the theory.
And,

495
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:39,630
and if that's the case then and let's 
say billions of people do it,

496
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
then the outcome for humanity will be 
the sum of,

497
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:53,590
of human will,
some of billions of people's desire for 

498
00:27:54,051 --> 00:27:59,051
the future and that,
that Koreans have people with enhanced 

499
00:27:59,051 --> 00:28:00,790
cognitive ability radically enhance.
Yes.

500
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:05,540
And which would be at how much different
than people today.

501
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:10,570
Like if you,
if you had to explain it to a person who

502
00:28:10,881 --> 00:28:12,300
didn't really know or understand what 
you were saying,

503
00:28:12,301 --> 00:28:16,070
like how much different are you talking 
about when you say radically improved?

504
00:28:16,071 --> 00:28:16,760
Like what do you mean?

505
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:23,910
You mean mine read or difficult?
It will be difficult to really 

506
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:24,350
appreciate the difference.
Um,

507
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:31,360
it was kind like how much smarter are 
you with a phone or computer than 

508
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:31,360
without?
It's,

509
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,950
you're vastly smarter.
Actually,

510
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:36,040
no,
you can answer any question.

511
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:40,060
If you're connected to the Internet,
you can ask her any question pretty much

512
00:28:40,061 --> 00:28:41,950
instantly,
any calculation,

513
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:42,990
uh,
the,

514
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:45,370
that your phone's memory is essentially 
perfect.

515
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:50,810
Uh,
you can remember flawlessly or put your 

516
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:50,810
phone,
can remember videos,

517
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:55,150
pictures and everything perfectly.
That's the,

518
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:58,150
that your phone is already an extension 
of you.

519
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:03,600
You're already a Cyborg.
You don't even what most people don't 

520
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,451
realize they are already a Cyborg.
If that phone is an extension of 

521
00:29:06,461 --> 00:29:10,670
yourself,
it's just that the data rate,

522
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:16,170
the rate at which was communication rate
between you and the cybernetic extension

523
00:29:16,271 --> 00:29:19,780
of yourself that is your phone and 
computer is slow.

524
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:24,810
It's very slow and that that has like a 
tiny straw of,

525
00:29:27,501 --> 00:29:32,501
of,
of information flow between your 

526
00:29:32,501 --> 00:29:35,431
biological self and your digital self.
And we need to make that tiny stroll 

527
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:41,860
like a giant river,
huge high bandwidth interface,

528
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,810
interface,
problem,

529
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,250
data rate problem,
solve the data rate problem.

530
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:54,500
And I think,
I think we can hang onto human machine 

531
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:59,401
symbiosis through the longterm.
And then people may decide that they 

532
00:30:00,851 --> 00:30:02,770
want to retain their biological self.
We're not,

533
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:07,090
I think they'll probably choose to 
retain their biological self

534
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:12,860
versus some sort of Ray Kurzweil 
scenario where they download themselves 

535
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:12,860
into a computer.

536
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:15,140
You will be essentially snapshot it into
a computer at any time.

537
00:30:15,141 --> 00:30:18,560
If your biological self dies,
you could just probably just upload into

538
00:30:18,561 --> 00:30:21,440
a new unit that's really

539
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:25,050
pass that whiskey.
We're getting crazy over here.

540
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,440
Kind of ridiculous.
Down the rabbit hole.

541
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,370
Grab that software.
Can you tell me that this is too freaky?

542
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:35,340
See if I've been thinking about this for
a long time.

543
00:30:35,341 --> 00:30:40,341
By the way,
I believe if I was talking to one more 

544
00:30:40,341 --> 00:30:40,341
cheers by the way.
Cherished.

545
00:30:40,341 --> 00:30:40,341
Okay.
This is a great whiskey.

546
00:30:40,341 --> 00:30:43,710
Thank you.
Know where this came from.

547
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,690
Who brought this to us?
Trying to remember it.

548
00:30:45,691 --> 00:30:47,820
Somebody gave it to us old camp,
whoever it was.

549
00:30:47,821 --> 00:30:48,720
Thanks.
Good.

550
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,410
Yeah,
it is good.

551
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:52,860
Um,
this is just inevitable.

552
00:30:52,861 --> 00:30:54,120
Again,
going back to your,

553
00:30:54,121 --> 00:30:56,870
when you decided to have this fatalistic
view points,

554
00:30:56,871 --> 00:30:58,710
so you weren't,
you tried to warn people.

555
00:30:58,711 --> 00:31:00,810
You talked about this pretty 
extensively.

556
00:31:00,811 --> 00:31:03,660
I've read several interviews where he 
talked about this and then you just sort

557
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:04,290
of just said,
okay,

558
00:31:04,291 --> 00:31:07,440
just is,
let's just end you in a way.

559
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:12,500
You're by communicating the potential.
I mean for sure you're getting the 

560
00:31:13,261 --> 00:31:14,610
warning out to some people.

561
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:17,890
Yeah.
Yeah.

562
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:22,900
I mean I was really going on the warning
quite,

563
00:31:22,901 --> 00:31:27,901
quite a lot.
I was wondering everyone I could you 

564
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:32,620
ever met with Obama and just put one 
reason look at?

565
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,080
Yes.
And what did he say?

566
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:38,290
So what about Hillary?
Worry about her first.

567
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:42,340
She didn't know he listened.
He certainly listened.

568
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,280
Um,
I met with Congress.

569
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:50,940
I met with.
I was at a meeting of old 50 governors 

570
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:57,030
and talked about just a ai danger and I 
talk to everyone I could.

571
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:03,970
No one seemed to realize where this was 
going.

572
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:10,380
Is it that or do they just assume that 
someone smarter than them is already 

573
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:10,950
taken care of it?
Because when,

574
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:12,460
when people hear about something like 
Ai,

575
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:15,130
it's almost abstract.
It's almost,

576
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:20,430
it's almost like it's so.
It's so hard to wrap your head around 

577
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:20,430
it.
By the time it already happens,

578
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:20,500
it will be too late.

579
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:27,280
Yeah.
I think they didn't quite understand it 

580
00:32:27,331 --> 00:32:32,331
or didn't think it was near term or not 
sure what to do about it.

581
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,340
I said like,
you know,

582
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:39,350
an obvious thing to do is to just 
establish a committee governance

583
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,650
committee to gain insight,
you know,

584
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,050
before,
before you oversight,

585
00:32:45,051 --> 00:32:50,051
before you do make regulations they 
should like try to understand what's 

586
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,700
going on and then if you have an insight
committee

587
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:54,370
then the,

588
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:57,210
once they learn what's going on and get 
up to speed,

589
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:02,670
then they can make maybe some roles for 
proposed some rules and,

590
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:07,500
and that would be probably a safer way 
to go about things it seems.

591
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:12,560
I mean I know that it's probably 
something that the government supposed 

592
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,090
to handle,
but it seems like I wouldn't want the.

593
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,030
I don't want the government to handle 
this.

594
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,010
Who Do you want to have one you to 
handle?

595
00:33:17,011 --> 00:33:18,000
Oh Geez.
Yeah.

596
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:21,300
I feel like you're the one who could 
ring the bell better because if,

597
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,460
if Mike pence starts talking about Ai,
I'm like,

598
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:25,740
shut up bitch.
You don't know anything about Ai.

599
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:26,760
Come up,
man.

600
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:28,700
He hasn't.
Nobody's talking about anything,

601
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,110
but I don't have the power to regulate 
other companies.

602
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,230
What am I supposed to?
Maybe companies could agree.

603
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,220
Maybe good.
There could be some sort of a way.

604
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:41,230
I mean there's.
We have agreements where you're not 

605
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:41,230
supposed to dump toxic waste into the 
ocean.

606
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:42,900
You're not supposed to do certain 
things.

607
00:33:42,901 --> 00:33:46,920
It could be terribly damaging even 
though there'll be profitable.

608
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:52,550
Maybe this is one of those things.
Maybe we should realize that you can't 

609
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:55,011
hit the switch on something that's going
to be able to think for itself and make 

610
00:33:55,011 --> 00:33:58,011
up its own mind as to whether or not it 
wants to survive or not and whether or 

611
00:33:58,011 --> 00:33:58,011
not it thinks you were a threat

612
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,260
and whether or not it thinks you're 
useless.

613
00:34:00,261 --> 00:34:05,261
Like why do I keep this dumb,
finite life form alive?

614
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:07,220
Why?
Why keep this thing around?

615
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:09,910
It's just stupid.
It's just keeps polluting everything she

616
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:10,850
ever wear.
Co's,

617
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,340
lighting everything on fire and shooting
each other.

618
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,990
Why would I keep this stupid thing 
alive?

619
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:17,510
Because sometimes it makes good music.
You know?

620
00:34:17,511 --> 00:34:22,511
Sometimes it makes great movies.
Sometimes it makes beautiful art and 

621
00:34:22,511 --> 00:34:25,541
sometimes you know,
sometimes it's cool to hang out with my 

622
00:34:25,541 --> 00:34:26,210
reasons.
For us,

623
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,760
those are great reasons,
but for anything objective,

624
00:34:28,761 --> 00:34:29,720
standing outside like,
oh,

625
00:34:29,721 --> 00:34:34,721
this is definitely a flawed system.
This is like if you went to the jungle 

626
00:34:34,721 --> 00:34:36,050
and you watch these chimps engage in 
warfare and beat each other with sticks,

627
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,350
they're fucking really fucking mean.
The real.

628
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,590
So that movie chimpanzee.
Yeah,

629
00:34:39,591 --> 00:34:40,640
that was gonna be like some.
There's anything.

630
00:34:40,641 --> 00:34:41,840
I was like,
holy cow,

631
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,680
what movie was that?

632
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,120
It looks really cool.
Chimpanzee,

633
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,470
who is it?
A documentary?

634
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,430
Yeah.
Yeah.

635
00:34:46,431 --> 00:34:48,050
It's kind of like a documentary.
I was like,

636
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:50,690
damn,
these chimps are mean.

637
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:53,020
They're mean,
they're cruel.

638
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:55,730
They're calculated.
Yeah.

639
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:58,280
Yeah.
They sneak up on each other and like,

640
00:34:58,281 --> 00:35:01,070
I didn't realize chimps did calculator.
Cruelty.

641
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:05,300
Yeah.
It's pretty left that meeting.

642
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,010
Kind of like game over.
This is dark,

643
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:07,670
right?
Well,

644
00:35:07,671 --> 00:35:11,330
we know better because we've advanced,
but if we hadn't,

645
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,500
we'd be like,
man,

646
00:35:12,501 --> 00:35:15,110
I don't want to fucking live in a house.
I like the champ ways,

647
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,910
bro.
Chimp ways to go.

648
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:21,170
This is it man.
Chimp life right now,

649
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:25,850
but we in a way to the AI might be like 
those chimps,

650
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:31,120
like these stupid Fox launching missiles
out of drones and shooting each other 

651
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,570
underwater.
Like we're crazy.

652
00:35:32,571 --> 00:35:37,571
We got torpedoes,
submarines and fucking airplanes that 

653
00:35:37,571 --> 00:35:42,141
drop nuclear bombs indiscriminately on 
cities were assholes too.

654
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,580
Yeah.
They might go,

655
00:35:44,581 --> 00:35:46,740
why are they doing this?
It might like,

656
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:51,770
look at our politics,
look at what we do in terms of our food 

657
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:56,451
system,
what kind of food we forced down each 

658
00:35:56,451 --> 00:35:56,760
other's throats,
and they might go this.

659
00:35:56,761 --> 00:35:58,830
These people are crazy.
Didn't even look out for themselves.

660
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,680
I don't know.
How much do we think about chimps?

661
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,150
Not much.
Very little.

662
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:08,450
It's like these chimps are at war.
They look like groups of chimps just 

663
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:14,340
attack each other and they kill each 
other and they torture each other.

664
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:16,350
That's pretty bad.
Um,

665
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:21,410
they hunt monkeys there,
but like,

666
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:25,070
this is probably the most.
But you know,

667
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:30,120
I mean,
when's the last time we talked about 

668
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,280
chimps but me all the time.
If you do talk to the podcast episode,

669
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,020
people are laughing right now.
Yeah,

670
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:38,400
constantly.
I'm obsessed.

671
00:36:38,401 --> 00:36:43,401
I saw that David attenborough 
documentary on Champs when they were 

672
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:44,550
eating those calibus monkeys and ripping
them apart that many,

673
00:36:44,551 --> 00:36:46,860
many years ago,
and it just changed how I go,

674
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,260
Oh,
this is why people are so crazy.

675
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,090
We came from that thing.
Yeah,

676
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,030
exactly.
Yeah.

677
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:55,380
Yeah.
I got a better philosophy.

678
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:56,460
Yeah.
They like swingers.

679
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,080
Yeah,
they really are.

680
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:02,730
They're they.
They seem to be way more even than us.

681
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:07,760
Way More civilized.
They just seemed to resolve everything 

682
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,621
with sex.
The only rules they have as the mom 

683
00:37:12,621 --> 00:37:12,621
won't bang the Sun.
That's it.

684
00:37:12,621 --> 00:37:12,621
Okay.
That's it.

685
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:13,850
Mom.
I'll bring your sons.

686
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:17,760
They're good women.
Good women in the community.

687
00:37:17,761 --> 00:37:19,570
Everybody else is banging it out.
Yeah.

688
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,140
I haven't seen the Lenovo movie.

689
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:26,010
Well,
they're disturbing just at a zoo.

690
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:28,680
Benobos at the zoo.
They just constantly going constantly.

691
00:37:28,681 --> 00:37:32,120
Fucking boring stuff.
Yeah,

692
00:37:32,121 --> 00:37:33,060
and they don't care.
Gay,

693
00:37:33,061 --> 00:37:33,900
straight,
whatever.

694
00:37:33,901 --> 00:37:38,901
Let's just fuck.
I haven't seen was at a zoo s probably 

695
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:42,440
like the PGA section.
Yeah,

696
00:37:42,441 --> 00:37:43,980
I don't think they have them at many 
zoos.

697
00:37:43,981 --> 00:37:46,850
We've looked at it before.
It was probably pretty awkward.

698
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:51,950
I think that's the thing that they like 
to keep regular chimps at zoos because 

699
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:54,870
Benomo was just always jacking off and 
what's that they have in San Diego has 

700
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,700
got some really interesting,
probably separate them.

701
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,550
How many other in a cage?
It's going to be pretty intense.

702
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,530
We'll go.
Yeah,

703
00:38:04,531 --> 00:38:06,120
we're were a weird thing,
you know,

704
00:38:06,121 --> 00:38:08,520
and I've often wondered if whether or 
not we're,

705
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:13,670
you know,
our ultimate goal is to give birth to 

706
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,450
some new thing and that that's why we're
so obsessed with technology because it's

707
00:38:15,451 --> 00:38:20,451
not like this technology is really.
I mean it's certainly enhancing our 

708
00:38:20,451 --> 00:38:23,601
lives to in a certain way,
but I mean ultimately is it making 

709
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:27,780
people happier right now?
Most technology I would say no.

710
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:32,990
In fact,
you and I were talking about social 

711
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:34,851
media before this,
about just not having instagram on your 

712
00:38:34,851 --> 00:38:35,130
phone and not dealing with you feel 
better.

713
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:36,100
Yes.

714
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:41,100
I think that one of the issues with 
social media that's been pointed out by 

715
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,790
many people is that,
um,

716
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:47,460
I think maybe particularly instagram,
um,

717
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:52,600
people look like they have a much better
life than they really do.

718
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,510
Right?
So by design.

719
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,330
Yeah.
People are posting pictures of when they

720
00:38:57,331 --> 00:39:02,331
were really happy there are modifying 
those pictures to be better looking if 

721
00:39:02,741 --> 00:39:04,000
they're not modifying the pictures 
there,

722
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:06,340
at least selecting the pictures for the 
best lighting,

723
00:39:06,341 --> 00:39:11,341
the best angle.
So people basically seem I'll,

724
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,740
they're way better looking than they 
basically really are.

725
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:20,560
And they're way happier seeming than 
they really are.

726
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:23,500
So if you look at everyone on Instagram,
you might think,

727
00:39:23,501 --> 00:39:25,450
man,
they're always happy,

728
00:39:25,451 --> 00:39:30,130
beautiful people and I'm not that good 
login and I am not happy,

729
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,260
so I must suck,
you know.

730
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:37,470
And that's gonna make people sad.
So when in fact those people you think 

731
00:39:39,071 --> 00:39:41,620
are super happy,
actually not that happy.

732
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,350
Some of them are really depressed.
They're very sad.

733
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:50,170
So my happiest people actually some of 
the saddest people in reality.

734
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:53,310
Um,
and,

735
00:39:53,311 --> 00:39:55,100
and,
and nobody looks good all the time.

736
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,590
It doesn't matter who you are.
No,

737
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:02,610
it's not even something you should want.
Why do you want to look great all the 

738
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:02,610
time.
Yeah,

739
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:03,580
exactly.
So,

740
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,490
uh,
so I think,

741
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:08,740
I think things like that can make people
quite sad when you just,

742
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:10,300
just by comparison because you,
you just sort of,

743
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:15,310
you people,
people generally think of themselves 

744
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:15,910
relative to others.
It's,

745
00:40:15,911 --> 00:40:16,240
it's,
uh,

746
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,980
we're constantly re,
we baselining our expectations.

747
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,550
Um,
and you can see the,

748
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:29,640
if you watch some show like naked and 
afraid or if you're just going to try 

749
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,360
living in the woods by yourself for 
awhile in,

750
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:36,470
you,
like the learn that civilization was 

751
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:38,620
quite great.
It has a lot of people want to come back

752
00:40:38,621 --> 00:40:40,750
to civilization pretty fast on naked and
afraid.

753
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:45,870
Wasn't that a thoreau quote?
The comparison is the thief of joy of 

754
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:48,070
happiness is reality minus expectations.

755
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:56,080
That's great too.
But the comparison is the thief of joy 

756
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:56,080
really holds true to peep.
Is it they don't.

757
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,310
Roosevelt Roosevelt Fascinating,
um,

758
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:01,340
in,
when you think about instagram,

759
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:06,370
because would essentially instagram is 
with a lot of people is you're giving 

760
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:09,131
them the opportunity to be their own pr 
agent and they always go towards the 

761
00:41:09,171 --> 00:41:10,760
glamorous,
you know,

762
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:14,060
and whenever anybody does show Hashtag 
no filter,

763
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:16,160
they have,
they really do do that.

764
00:41:16,161 --> 00:41:16,430
Like,
oh,

765
00:41:16,431 --> 00:41:17,360
you're so brave.
Look,

766
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:21,560
you don't make up now they look good.
Anyway.

767
00:41:21,561 --> 00:41:22,700
You look great.
What are you doing?

768
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,610
Oh my God.
You don't have makeup on and still a hot

769
00:41:24,611 --> 00:41:25,670
as fuck.
You know what you're doing.

770
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:28,010
I know what you're doing to.
They're there.

771
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:31,490
They're letting you know and then the 
feed off that comment section.

772
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:34,640
Woo.
Just a little bit sitting there like,

773
00:41:34,641 --> 00:41:36,740
look,
it's a fresh stream of love,

774
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:41,800
like you getting right up to the sources
that comes out of the earth and just 

775
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:41,800
suck in that water.

776
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,010
Emojis,
emojis.

777
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:44,650
Yeah.
A lot of allergies.

778
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:48,530
My what?
My concern is not so much what instagram

779
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:53,560
is,
is that I didn't think that people had 

780
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,640
the need for this or the expectation for
some sort of technology that allows them

781
00:41:55,641 --> 00:42:00,641
to constantly get love and adulation 
from strangers and comments and this 

782
00:42:00,641 --> 00:42:03,650
ability to project this sort of 
distorted version of who you really are,

783
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:07,100
but I worry about where it goes.
Like what's the next one?

784
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:08,730
What's the next one?
Like,

785
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,940
where is it?
Is it going to be augmented in some sort

786
00:42:10,941 --> 00:42:15,941
of a weird augmented or virtual sort of 
instagram type situation where you're 

787
00:42:15,941 --> 00:42:17,900
not going to want to live in this real 
world,

788
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:23,050
you're going to want to interface with 
this sort of world that you've created 

789
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:25,010
through your social media page and some 
next level thing.

790
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:28,730
Go live in the simulation?
Yeah,

791
00:42:28,731 --> 00:42:32,000
maybe in the simulation ready player one
type shit that's real.

792
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,990
That seems.
We have that htc vive here and I've only

793
00:42:35,991 --> 00:42:38,420
done it a couple times quite honestly 
because it kind of freaks me out.

794
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,550
My kids fucking love it,
man.

795
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:44,520
They love it.
They love playing these Weirdo Games and

796
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,680
walking around with that headset on.
But part of me watching them do it goes,

797
00:42:48,681 --> 00:42:51,530
wow,
I wonder if this is like the precursor,

798
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:53,900
just sort of like if you look at that 
phone,

799
00:42:53,901 --> 00:42:58,901
that Gordon Gekko hat on the beach and 
compare that to like a galaxy note nine.

800
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:01,760
Like how the fuck did that become that?
Right?

801
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,260
And I wonder when I see this htc vive 
and my,

802
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:09,580
what is that thing gonna be 10 years 
from now when we're making fun of what 

803
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:09,950
it is now,
what is it?

804
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:10,520
How?
I mean,

805
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:13,580
how ingrained and how,
how,

806
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:18,230
how connected and interconnected is this
technology going to be in our life?

807
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:26,360
It will be at some point 
indistinguishable from reality

808
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,590
where we'll lose this or lose this.
Like you and I just looked at each other

809
00:43:30,591 --> 00:43:32,330
through our eyes.
I see you where you see me,

810
00:43:32,331 --> 00:43:33,740
I think.
I hope you think so.

811
00:43:33,741 --> 00:43:35,270
I think you probably have read it.
Regularize.

812
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,540
This could be some simulation.
It could.

813
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:39,830
Do you entertain that?

814
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:48,120
Well,
the argument for the simulation I think 

815
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:51,271
is quite strong because if you assume 
any improvements at all over time,

816
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:55,690
any improvement,
one percent point one percent.

817
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:58,180
Just extend the timeframe.
Make it a thousand years,

818
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:01,000
a million years.
The Universe is 13 point 8 billion years

819
00:44:01,001 --> 00:44:04,820
old.
What civilization,

820
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:07,250
if you counted,
if you're very generous,

821
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:11,060
civilization is maybe seven or 8,000
years old.

822
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:14,300
If you counted from the first writing.
This is nothing.

823
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:19,730
This is nothing.
So if you assume any rate of improvement

824
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:26,530
at all,
then games will be indistinguishable 

825
00:44:27,021 --> 00:44:32,021
from reality or civilization

826
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,050
will end one of those two things will 
occur.

827
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:39,560
We are most likely in a simulation

828
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:42,800
or we're on our way,
right?

829
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:46,460
Well,
we could most certainly be on the road.

830
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:48,050
We could be on the road,
did that,

831
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:53,470
right?
It doesn't mean that it has to face 

832
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:53,470
reality.
It could be in base reality.

833
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:57,550
We could be here now on our way to the 
road or on her way to the destination 

834
00:44:59,031 --> 00:45:04,031
where this can never happen again,
where we are completely ingrained in 

835
00:45:04,031 --> 00:45:08,891
some sort of an artificial technology or
some sort of a symbiotic relationship 

836
00:45:08,891 --> 00:45:11,390
with the internet or the next level of 
sharing information.

837
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:13,820
But right now we're not there yet.
That's possible too,

838
00:45:13,821 --> 00:45:18,821
right?
It's possible that a simulation is one 

839
00:45:18,821 --> 00:45:21,911
day going to be inevitable,
that we're going to have something 

840
00:45:21,911 --> 00:45:21,911
that's indistinguishable from regular 
reality,

841
00:45:21,911 --> 00:45:23,060
but maybe we're not there yet.
That's also possible.

842
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:26,770
We're not quite there yet.
That this is real.

843
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:32,520
When I touched that feels very real.
Maybe that's why everybody's like 

844
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:35,181
getting to like mason jars and shit.
Mason's suede shoes people wear to like 

845
00:45:35,181 --> 00:45:37,260
craft restaurants and they wouldn't want
raw wood.

846
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:39,730
Everyone says everyone else.
See Metal people.

847
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:44,350
It seems like people are like longing 
toward some weird log cabin type.

848
00:45:44,351 --> 00:45:45,850
Nostalgia reality.
Yeah.

849
00:45:45,851 --> 00:45:49,960
Like holding on like clinging to her,
dragging their nails through the mud.

850
00:45:49,961 --> 00:45:53,380
Like don't take me a yes,
but then.

851
00:45:53,381 --> 00:45:56,440
But then people will go get a mason jar 
with the Weinstein or handle

852
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,270
that's dark.

853
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:02,300
Makes me lose faith in humanity.
Wind Stamina,

854
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:03,350
handle.
They have those.

855
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:06,470
Oh that's dirty.
People are just assholes.

856
00:46:06,471 --> 00:46:08,290
That's like,
people make pet rocks rough.

857
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,100
Right?
There's some people are just assholes.

858
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:11,230
They take advantage of our,
our,

859
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,620
our generous nature.
It was made with the Weinstein made with

860
00:46:15,621 --> 00:46:17,960
handle.
They made it that way.

861
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:21,780
So the,
onto the mace.

862
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:26,840
Ah,
you thought that would be fine if there 

863
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,130
was like glued it on or something,
but it was made that way.

864
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:29,300
White trash chic.
Oh,

865
00:46:29,301 --> 00:46:30,670
this is disgusting.
This.

866
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:32,010
Here it is right there.
Yup.

867
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,110
This is terrible.

868
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:40,160
Yeah.
That's like fake breasts that are 

869
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,040
designed to be hard.
Like fake breasts from the sixties.

870
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,580
It's like if you really long for the 
ones with ripples,

871
00:46:47,581 --> 00:46:48,330
here we go.

872
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:50,960
Yeah.
That's almost what that is.

873
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:53,030
Yeah.
What are you going to do,

874
00:46:53,031 --> 00:46:54,270
man?
It's not nothing.

875
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:58,220
It's not need to stop certain terrible 
ideas from propagating.

876
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,820
Yeah.
Um,

877
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:03,590
anyway,
I,

878
00:47:03,591 --> 00:47:06,120
I don't want to sound like,
like thanks for too dark because I think

879
00:47:06,121 --> 00:47:07,520
like,
you kind of have to

880
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:13,670
be optimistic about the future.
There's no point in being pessimistic.

881
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:16,480
It's just too negative.
Does this,

882
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,230
it doesn't help,
you know,

883
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:20,810
I think you want to be.
I mean,

884
00:47:20,811 --> 00:47:23,840
my theory is like you'd rather be 
optimistic.

885
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:27,380
I think I'd rather be optimistic and 
wrong than pessimistic and.

886
00:47:27,381 --> 00:47:28,930
Right.
Right.

887
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:31,000
Police around that side.
Right.

888
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:32,010
Yeah.
Because if,

889
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:34,390
if you're pessimistic is going to be as 
miserable.

890
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:36,920
Yeah.
Yeah.

891
00:47:36,921 --> 00:47:38,440
And nobody wants to be around you 
anyway.

892
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:39,520
If it's the end of the world,
you know,

893
00:47:39,521 --> 00:47:40,690
like I told you,
Bro.

894
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:43,240
Yeah.
The world's ending.

895
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:46,280
Yeah.
It is what it is.

896
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,460
Enjoy the journey.
Right?

897
00:47:48,461 --> 00:47:50,860
If you really want to get morose,
I mean,

898
00:47:50,861 --> 00:47:55,390
it is what it is for all of us anyway.
We were all going to go unless something

899
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:56,350
changes.
Yeah,

900
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,350
I mean ultimately,
you know,

901
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:01,540
even if we just sort of existed as 
humans forever,

902
00:48:01,541 --> 00:48:06,541
we'd be with still eventually,
that'd be like the heat death of the 

903
00:48:06,541 --> 00:48:06,541
universe,
right?

904
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:09,700
Israelian years from now,
right now if we get it past the sun,

905
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,180
if we figured out a way past the son 
running out of juice,

906
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:16,270
eventually it's going to end.
It's just a question of when.

907
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:20,620
Right?
So it really is all about the journey or

908
00:48:20,621 --> 00:48:25,621
transcendence from whatever we are now 
into something that doesn't worry about 

909
00:48:25,621 --> 00:48:25,621
death.

910
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:32,210
The universe as we know it will 
dissipate into a fine mist of cold.

911
00:48:35,011 --> 00:48:40,011
Nothing this eventually,
and then someone's going to bottle it 

912
00:48:40,011 --> 00:48:42,501
and put a fragrance to it,
sell it to French people in another 

913
00:48:42,501 --> 00:48:43,590
dimension.
So it's a very long time.

914
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,000
So I think it's really just about how 
can we make it last longer.

915
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:51,870
Are you a proponent of the multiuniverse
theory?

916
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:55,470
Do you believe that there are many,
many universes and that even if this one

917
00:48:55,471 --> 00:49:00,471
fades out,
that there's other ones that are 

918
00:49:00,471 --> 00:49:00,471
starting fresh right now and there's an 
infinite number of them,

919
00:49:00,471 --> 00:49:03,810
they're just constantly in this never 
ending cycle of birth and death.

920
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,880
I think most likely,
this is just about probability.

921
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:14,480
There are many,
many simulations,

922
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:19,390
these simulations or we might as well 
call them reality or you could call them

923
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:24,400
the multiverse.
These simulations you believe are 

924
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,010
created like someone has managed running
on a substrate,

925
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:29,690
so that substrate is probably boring,
boring.

926
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:32,900
How so?
Well,

927
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:36,710
when we create a simulation like a game 
or a movie,

928
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,440
it's a distillation of what's 
interesting about life.

929
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:41,460
You know,
like it,

930
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:46,630
it takes,
it can take a year to shoot an action 

931
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:48,800
movie and then that's all distilled down
into two or three hours.

932
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:52,850
So let me tell you,
if you see an action movie being filmed,

933
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,140
frigging boring,
super boring takes.

934
00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:00,620
There's lots of takes those.
Everything's in a green screen,

935
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:03,530
looks pretty goofy,
doesn't look cool,

936
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:07,700
but once you add the CGI and have great 
editing,

937
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:13,390
it's amazing.
So I think most likely if we're a 

938
00:50:15,861 --> 00:50:20,861
simulation,
it's really boring outside the 

939
00:50:20,861 --> 00:50:23,711
simulation because why would you make 
simulation that's boring because it 

940
00:50:23,791 --> 00:50:28,030
makes simulation way more interesting in
the base reality that is if this right

941
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:33,030
now is a simulation and ultimately 
inevitably we're,

942
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:35,480
if as long as we don't die or get hit by
a meteor,

943
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:40,720
we're going to create some sort of 
simulation if we continue on the same 

944
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:41,210
technological path we're on,
we're on right now,

945
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:45,380
but we might not be there yet.
So it might not be a simulation here,

946
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:49,850
but it most likely is you feel other 
places,

947
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:56,460
this notion of place or where is a 
flawed,

948
00:50:57,490 --> 00:51:00,300
flawed perception like that if you have 
this sort of,

949
00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:06,950
but a vive,
which that's made by valve and steam and

950
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:11,910
it's really valve that made it.
HDC did the hardware,

951
00:51:11,911 --> 00:51:14,500
but it's really evolved thing.
Um,

952
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:19,230
makers of Halflife yes,
a great company.

953
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:19,980
Great Company.

954
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,320
Hmm.
Uh,

955
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:27,060
when you're in that,
in that,

956
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:32,370
in that virtual reality,
which is only going to get better,

957
00:51:33,870 --> 00:51:36,810
where are you?
Where are you really?

958
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:38,520
Right?
You aren't anywhere.

959
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,960
Well,
whereas in the computer,

960
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:45,390
what you know,
what defines where you are exactly 

961
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:45,600
right.
It's your perception is your perceptions

962
00:51:45,601 --> 00:51:47,850
or is it a scale that we have under your
butt.

963
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,440
You right here,
I've measured you.

964
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,120
You're the same weight as you were when 
you left.

965
00:51:52,830 --> 00:51:57,830
Meanwhile you're experienced.
Do you think you're where you are right 

966
00:51:57,830 --> 00:51:57,830
now?
You might not be.

967
00:51:57,830 --> 00:52:01,910
I'll spark up a joint.
If you keep talking to your manager's 

968
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:01,910
gonna,
come in here.

969
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:02,370
We might have to lock the door right 
now.

970
00:52:02,371 --> 00:52:04,470
You think you're in a studio in la?
That's what I heard.

971
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:06,030
You might be in a computer.
Oh,

972
00:52:06,031 --> 00:52:06,530
medicine.
Man,

973
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,960
I think about this all the time.
Yeah,

974
00:52:09,961 --> 00:52:13,890
I mean it's unquestionable that one day 
that'll be the case.

975
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,520
As long as we keep going,
as long as nothing interrupts us,

976
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:22,550
and if we start from scratch and you 
know we're single celled organisms all 

977
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:26,160
over again and then millions and 
millions of years later would become the

978
00:52:26,161 --> 00:52:31,161
next thing that is us with creativity 
and the ability to change the 

979
00:52:31,161 --> 00:52:32,070
environment.
It's going to keep monkeying with things

980
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:36,030
until it figures out a way to change 
reality to change,

981
00:52:36,031 --> 00:52:41,031
I mean almost like punch a hole through 
what is this thing into what,

982
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:46,940
what it wants it to be and create new 
things and then those new things will 

983
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:51,171
intersect with other people's new things
and then it will be this ultimate 

984
00:52:51,171 --> 00:52:54,081
pathway of infinite ideas and expression
all through technology.

985
00:52:56,050 --> 00:52:56,380
Yeah.

986
00:52:57,230 --> 00:53:02,230
And then we're wondering,
we're going to wonder like why are we 

987
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:02,230
here?
What are we doing?

988
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:07,500
Let's find out why.
I mean,

989
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:12,520
I think we should take the actions,
the set of actions that are most likely 

990
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:14,630
to make the future better.
Yes.

991
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:15,640
Right.
Yeah.

992
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:16,700
Right,
right.

993
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:20,040
And then reevaluate those actions to 
make sure that they're there.

994
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,690
That it's true.
Well,

995
00:53:21,691 --> 00:53:23,570
I think there's a movement to that.
I mean,

996
00:53:23,571 --> 00:53:28,571
in terms of like a social movement,
I think some of it's misguided and some 

997
00:53:28,571 --> 00:53:32,001
of it's exaggerated and there's a Lotta,
a lot of people that are fighting for 

998
00:53:32,001 --> 00:53:36,021
their side out there,
but it seems like the general trend of 

999
00:53:36,021 --> 00:53:40,541
like a social awareness seems to be much
more heightened now than it's ever been 

1000
00:53:41,221 --> 00:53:46,221
in any other time in history because of 
our ability to express ourselves 

1001
00:53:46,221 --> 00:53:49,980
instantaneously to each other through 
facebook or twitter or what have you,

1002
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:55,580
and that the trend is to abandon 
preconceived notions,

1003
00:53:56,730 --> 00:53:59,670
abandoned prejudice,
abandoned discrimination,

1004
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:03,870
and promote kindness and happiness as 
much as possible.

1005
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:05,370
Looking at this knife.
Somebody gave it to me.

1006
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:07,500
Sorry.
What the fuck did you do?

1007
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:13,070
My friend Dani.
I brought this with him and it just 

1008
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:13,070
stayed here.
I have a real Samurai sword.

1009
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:13,830
Fun To play with that.
I know you're into weapons.

1010
00:54:13,831 --> 00:54:16,950
That's from the 15 hundreds.
Samurais or at the end of the table.

1011
00:54:16,951 --> 00:54:17,580
Yeah.
That's cool.

1012
00:54:17,581 --> 00:54:17,970
I'll grab it.

1013
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:18,830
Hold on.

1014
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Yeah,
that's a Legit Samurai sword from an 

1015
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,960
actual Samurai from the 15 hundreds.
If you pull out that blade,

1016
00:54:34,961 --> 00:54:39,961
that bleed was made the old way.
Where a master craftsman folded that 

1017
00:54:40,691 --> 00:54:45,691
metal and hammered it down over and over
again over a long period of time and 

1018
00:54:45,691 --> 00:54:50,341
honed that blade into what it is now.
What's crazy is that more than 500 years

1019
00:54:50,711 --> 00:54:52,810
later,
that thing is still pristine.

1020
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:59,210
I mean,
whoever took care of that and pass it 

1021
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:00,170
down to the next person who took care of
it and you know,

1022
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:03,150
til it got to the podcast room,
it's pretty fucking crazy.

1023
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:05,730
Yeah.
One day someone's going to be looking at

1024
00:55:05,731 --> 00:55:10,410
a tesla like that [inaudible].
He's fucking back doors.

1025
00:55:10,411 --> 00:55:15,411
They pop up sideways like a Lamborghini.
You should see what tesla can do.

1026
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:21,030
Uh,
you didn't.

1027
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:22,980
You should.
I'll show you after driven one.

1028
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:24,120
I love them.
Yeah.

1029
00:55:24,121 --> 00:55:29,121
But most people don't know what it can 
do in terms of like ludicrous mode in 

1030
00:55:29,121 --> 00:55:33,501
terms of like driving super fast and 
irresponsibly on public roads is that 

1031
00:55:33,501 --> 00:55:33,930
were saying why do you call it can do 
that.

1032
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:36,360
Yeah.
What can it do that,

1033
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:42,100
that I need to know about having the 
model x can do this like ballet thing to

1034
00:55:42,101 --> 00:55:44,320
the Trans Siberian orchestra.
It's pretty cool.

1035
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:49,350
We're at dances if legitimately like 
moves you out to that.

1036
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:55,660
Why would you program that seemed like 
fun.

1037
00:55:56,650 --> 00:55:58,840
That's what I get about you.
That's what's weird.

1038
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:04,050
Like when you showed up here,
you were all smiles and you pull out a 

1039
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:06,871
fucking blow torch and not a blow torch,
but I'm like looking at the flame 

1040
00:56:06,871 --> 00:56:06,871
thrower,
not a flame thrower,

1041
00:56:06,871 --> 00:56:11,750
Mike.
It's definitely not like you're having 

1042
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:14,371
fun.
Like this is a like this thing when you 

1043
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:16,210
know your program,
a car to do a ballet,

1044
00:56:16,211 --> 00:56:17,740
dance,
fun.

1045
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:23,290
How do you have the time to do that?
I don't understand why you're digging 

1046
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:24,170
holes under the earth.
Incentive rockets into space and and

1047
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:29,370
power in people in Australia.
Like how the fuck do you have time to 

1048
00:56:29,370 --> 00:56:32,200
make the car dance ballet?
Well,

1049
00:56:32,310 --> 00:56:37,310
I mean,
in that case there were some engineers 

1050
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:38,410
at Tesla that said,
you know what?

1051
00:56:38,411 --> 00:56:41,470
If we make this car dance and play 
music,

1052
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:43,780
I was like,
that sounds great.

1053
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:48,640
Let's do it.
Let's try to get it done in time.

1054
00:56:48,641 --> 00:56:49,730
For Christmas.
We did.

1055
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:55,350
Is there a concern about someone just 
losing their mind and making do that in 

1056
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:55,900
the highway?
Now it wouldn't do that.

1057
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,730
What if it's in bumper to bumper 
traffic?

1058
00:56:58,060 --> 00:56:58,870
Nope.
No,

1059
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,400
won't do it.
Nope.

1060
00:57:00,401 --> 00:57:02,800
It's actually you have to just an Easter
egg.

1061
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:04,360
Oh,
it's an Easter egg.

1062
00:57:04,810 --> 00:57:07,080
That's why people don't know about it.
You put it here.

1063
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,430
We'll have the car.
It can do lots of things.

1064
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:11,710
Lots of things.
Once reddit gets a hold of it,

1065
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:13,180
everyone's,
Oh,

1066
00:57:13,181 --> 00:57:16,750
you just have to everyone.
If you search for it on the Internet,

1067
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:21,780
you will find out.
But people don't know that they should 

1068
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:21,780
even search for it.
Oh,

1069
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:23,050
well they do now.
Yes.

1070
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:26,170
Yes.
There's so many things about the model x

1071
00:57:26,171 --> 00:57:30,460
and the model s and the model three that
people don't know about.

1072
00:57:30,461 --> 00:57:35,461
We should probably do a video or 
something it and explain it because I 

1073
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:38,410
have close friends of mine and I say,
do you know the call can do this?

1074
00:57:38,411 --> 00:57:39,370
And they're like,
nope.

1075
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:46,710
Do you want to do a video though?
Do you like the fact that some people 

1076
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:46,750
don't know?
No,

1077
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:49,000
I think it's probably not.
We should tell people.

1078
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:50,020
Yeah,
probably.

1079
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:51,370
Yes.
That would help your product.

1080
00:57:52,050 --> 00:57:57,050
I mean,
it's not like you don't sell enough of 

1081
00:57:57,050 --> 00:57:57,050
them,
you sell almost too many of them.

1082
00:57:57,050 --> 00:57:58,630
Right.
The,

1083
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:05,680
I mean I think at Tesla is the most fun 
thing you could possibly buy ever.

1084
00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:11,180
That's what it's meant to be.
Well,

1085
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,340
our goal is to make.
It's,

1086
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:19,870
it's not exactly a car.
It's actually a thing to maximize 

1087
00:58:19,870 --> 00:58:22,790
enjoyment.
Make maximum fun.

1088
00:58:23,690 --> 00:58:27,950
Okay.
Electronic like big screen,

1089
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:31,220
laptop,
ridiculous speed handling,

1090
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:33,620
all that stuff.
Yeah.

1091
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:38,860
Do you have.
And you're going to put video games in 

1092
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:38,860
it?
You are?

1093
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:38,860
Yeah.
Is this wise?

1094
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:44,320
Well,
what you won't be able to drive while 

1095
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:44,320
you're playing the video game,
but we're like,

1096
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,080
for example,
we just,

1097
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:50,380
we're just putting the,
the Atari emulator rom memory later in 

1098
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:53,261
it,
so we'll play missile command and Lunar 

1099
00:58:53,261 --> 00:58:53,420
Lander and a bunch of other things.
Oh yeah,

1100
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:54,890
that sounds cool.
It's pretty fun.

1101
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:56,270
I like that.
Yeah.

1102
00:58:56,300 --> 00:59:01,300
And we improved the interface of missile
command because it's too hard with the 

1103
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:03,551
old track bull.
So this is the touchscreen version of 

1104
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:04,700
missile command.
So you have a chance.

1105
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:09,440
Do you have an old car?
Don't you?

1106
00:59:09,441 --> 00:59:11,960
Don't you have like an old Jaguar?
Yeah.

1107
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:12,780
That.
That's.

1108
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:16,850
That's a 61 series.
Warranty type Jagger.

1109
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:18,650
I love cars.
It's great.

1110
00:59:18,770 --> 00:59:19,940
Yeah.
I love old cars.

1111
00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:23,330
Yeah.
The only two,

1112
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:25,580
only two.
Your gasoline cars I have about that.

1113
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:26,390
And,

1114
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:27,680
and

1115
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:33,230
old Ford,
like a Ford model t that a friend of 

1116
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:35,070
mine gave me my only to gasoline cars is
the Ford model t all stock.

1117
00:59:35,090 --> 00:59:37,610
Well there's your car.
Ooh,

1118
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,750
look ahead with the convertible.
That is a gorgeous.

1119
00:59:40,751 --> 00:59:43,530
Our God.
That's a good looking car.

1120
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:45,750
Yes.
Is that yours?

1121
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:48,240
That is.
It's not mine.

1122
00:59:48,241 --> 00:59:53,241
It's extremely close to mine that I 
don't have a front license plate or 

1123
00:59:53,241 --> 00:59:53,241
mine.
Oh,

1124
00:59:53,241 --> 00:59:54,750
that's a beautiful car.
They knew that.

1125
00:59:54,770 --> 00:59:56,040
That's mine.
Looks like that.

1126
00:59:56,310 --> 00:59:57,390
God.
They nailed that.

1127
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:00,090
That's what mine looks like.
Very good.

1128
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:02,020
Is Money.
There's certain iconic shapes.

1129
01:00:02,770 --> 01:00:03,130
Yes.

1130
01:00:04,010 --> 01:00:06,380
And there's,
there's something about those cars too.

1131
01:00:06,381 --> 01:00:09,920
They're not as capable,
not nearly as capable as like a tesla,

1132
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:15,250
but there's something really satisfying 
about the mechanical aspect of feeling 

1133
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:18,770
the steering and the grinding of the 
gears and the shifting.

1134
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:23,320
There's something about those that's 
extremely satisfying even though they're

1135
01:00:23,321 --> 01:00:26,380
not that competent.
Like I have a 19,

1136
01:00:26,381 --> 01:00:31,381
93 porsche nine slash six four.
It's like a lightweight.

1137
01:00:31,570 --> 01:00:34,060
It's not as rs America.
It's not very fast.

1138
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:36,310
It's not like in comparison to a tesla 
or anything like that,

1139
01:00:36,730 --> 01:00:40,870
but the thing about it is like it's 
mechanical feel of everything.

1140
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:46,300
It's.
It gives you this weird thrill,

1141
01:00:46,301 --> 01:00:50,560
like you're on this clinky ride and this
all this feedback.

1142
01:00:51,390 --> 01:00:53,060
There's something to that.
Yeah,

1143
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:53,920
absolutely.
I mean,

1144
01:00:55,030 --> 01:01:00,030
yeah,
one type is like basically no 

1145
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:01,270
electronics.
It's just you like that,

1146
01:01:01,271 --> 01:01:04,020
but you also like electronics.
Yes.

1147
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:09,220
Like your teslas soup.
It's like the far end of electronics.

1148
01:01:09,550 --> 01:01:11,170
Yes.
Drives itself.

1149
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:14,740
It's driving itself better every day.
Yeah.

1150
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:20,300
It's like we're about to release the 
software that will enable you to just 

1151
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:22,120
turn it on and it'll drive from highway 
on,

1152
01:01:22,121 --> 01:01:27,121
ramp to a highway,
exit through lane changes to overtake 

1153
01:01:27,121 --> 01:01:27,670
other cars to go from one interchange 
the next.

1154
01:01:27,671 --> 01:01:30,160
If you get on,
say the four or five,

1155
01:01:30,670 --> 01:01:35,670
get off,
get off 300 miles later and go through 

1156
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:38,881
several highway interchanges and to 
overtake other cars and hook into the 

1157
01:01:38,881 --> 01:01:40,860
NAV system.
And then um,

1158
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,240
and you just meditating.

1159
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:43,270
Oh

1160
01:01:44,310 --> 01:01:49,310
yeah.
Because just traveling very kind of 

1161
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:51,790
eerie kind of eerie.
What did you think when you saw that 

1162
01:01:51,790 --> 01:01:51,870
video?
That dude fallen asleep behind the wheel

1163
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:55,140
and I'm sure you've seen it.
The one in San Francisco is like,

1164
01:01:55,141 --> 01:02:00,141
right outside of San Jose,
out cold like this and the car 

1165
01:02:00,141 --> 01:02:02,400
interpreter bumper traffic moving along.
Or have you seen it right?

1166
01:02:02,990 --> 01:02:03,510
Yeah,
yeah,

1167
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:08,511
we changed the software.
That's I think an old video which has 

1168
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:10,830
software where if,
if you don't touch the wheel,

1169
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:15,570
it will gradually slow down and put the 
emergency lights on and wake you up.

1170
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:16,860
Oh,
that's hilarious.

1171
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:20,460
That's hilarious.
Can you choose what voice wakes you up?

1172
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:22,650
Well,
it sort of more of a.

1173
01:02:23,230 --> 01:02:26,910
it's sort of honks honking.
This should be like wake up fuck face.

1174
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:29,040
Well,
bringing your fellow humans.

1175
01:02:29,110 --> 01:02:34,110
We could,
we could gently wake you up with a 

1176
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:34,110
sultry voice.
Oh,

1177
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:34,110
that would be good.

1178
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:34,800
Like a,
something with a southern accent.

1179
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,430
Hey,
why can't wake up sunshine?

1180
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:38,730
Hey Sweetie.
Thank you.

1181
01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:40,580
Exactly.
Why don't you wake like,

1182
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:43,620
pick.
You could pick your right like you want.

1183
01:02:43,850 --> 01:02:45,840
Yeah.
I choose the Australian girl for Siri.

1184
01:02:45,910 --> 01:02:46,920
Yeah.
Take her voice.

1185
01:02:46,921 --> 01:02:49,820
Do you want it to seductive?
Favorite Australian?

1186
01:02:49,930 --> 01:02:54,930
What?
Flavor of do what you want it to be 

1187
01:02:54,930 --> 01:02:54,930
angry.
It could be anything.

1188
01:02:54,930 --> 01:02:54,930
You want those Australian prison lady 
genes.

1189
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:56,340
Now when you,
um,

1190
01:02:56,370 --> 01:03:01,370
when you program something like that in,
is this in response to a concern or is 

1191
01:03:01,370 --> 01:03:03,060
it your own?
If you look at it and go,

1192
01:03:03,061 --> 01:03:04,280
Hey,
I'm.

1193
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:05,850
They shouldn't just be able to fall 
asleep.

1194
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:07,320
Wake him up.

1195
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:09,630
Yeah.
Yeah.

1196
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:11,710
We like know,
we're like,

1197
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:12,510
well,
you know,

1198
01:03:12,511 --> 01:03:17,511
people falling asleep.
We were about to do something about 

1199
01:03:17,511 --> 01:03:17,511
that.
Right?

1200
01:03:17,511 --> 01:03:19,020
But when you first released it,
you didn't consider it,

1201
01:03:19,021 --> 01:03:19,890
right?
You just like,

1202
01:03:19,891 --> 01:03:24,540
well no one's going to just sleep.
People fall asleep in cars all the time.

1203
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:26,100
Let's crash.
Yeah.

1204
01:03:26,101 --> 01:03:27,960
At least our car doesn't crash.
That's better.

1205
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:31,650
It's better not to crash.
Imagine if that God falling asleep in a,

1206
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:34,560
in a gasoline car.
They do all the time for sure.

1207
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:36,120
Yeah.
And it crashed and somebody.

1208
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:38,160
Yeah.
And in fact,

1209
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:42,570
the thing that really got me to,
it's like,

1210
01:03:42,571 --> 01:03:47,571
man,
we better get on autopilot going get it 

1211
01:03:47,571 --> 01:03:49,521
out.
There was a guy who was in an early 

1212
01:03:49,521 --> 01:03:52,731
Tesla driving down the highway and he 
fell asleep and he ran over a cyclist 

1213
01:03:52,731 --> 01:03:55,830
and killed them and cycles like,
man,

1214
01:03:55,831 --> 01:03:59,140
if we had the autopilot wouldn't run out
of the one.

1215
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:04,210
He might have fallen asleep,
but at least he wouldn't run over that 

1216
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:04,210
cyclist.

1217
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:09,550
So how did you implement it?
Like did you just use cameras in 

1218
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:10,790
programmed with the,
the,

1219
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:15,110
the system so that if it sees images it 
slows down.

1220
01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:20,690
And how much time do you give as the 
person who's in control of it allowed to

1221
01:04:20,691 --> 01:04:22,940
program how fast it goes?
Yes.

1222
01:04:23,830 --> 01:04:28,830
Yeah.
You can program it to be more or less 

1223
01:04:28,830 --> 01:04:29,420
like more conservative or more 
aggressive driver.

1224
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:31,910
Um,
and uh,

1225
01:04:31,911 --> 01:04:34,360
you can say what speed you want it to,
what,

1226
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:35,600
what speed is.
Okay.

1227
01:04:35,690 --> 01:04:37,730
I know you have ludicrous mode.
Do you have douchebag mode?

1228
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:45,960
Well,
it was just cuts people off well for 

1229
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:49,350
four lane changes.
That's tricky because if you're in like 

1230
01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:49,780
La,
like in last year,

1231
01:04:49,781 --> 01:04:50,870
pretty aggressive,
right?

1232
01:04:50,930 --> 01:04:52,580
It's pretty.
It's hard to change lanes sometimes.

1233
01:04:52,670 --> 01:04:56,900
It's hard to be sot nom.
It's hard to be numb day on here in La.

1234
01:04:57,180 --> 01:05:02,180
You get,
if you want to hit that Santa Monica 

1235
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:02,360
Boulevard off ramp.
I mean you got to be a little pushy.

1236
01:05:02,450 --> 01:05:03,680
You got to be a little pushy.
Yeah.

1237
01:05:03,681 --> 01:05:05,990
Especially if you're angry,
a little angry.

1238
01:05:05,991 --> 01:05:08,420
They don't want you in this speed up 
sometimes.

1239
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:13,760
You know.
I think people like overall a pretty 

1240
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:14,240
nice when the highway even in la,
but sometimes they're not.

1241
01:05:14,450 --> 01:05:18,050
Do you think the neurological health 
that probably everybody would

1242
01:05:18,050 --> 01:05:21,640
be locked in together as hive?
Mind tunnels will help it.

1243
01:05:21,670 --> 01:05:24,010
We're going to have traffic that'll help
a lot.

1244
01:05:24,260 --> 01:05:25,900
Yeah.
How many of those can you put in there?

1245
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:29,960
That's a nice thing about tunnels as you
can go through Edi.

1246
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:32,710
So many levels.
Right?

1247
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:35,230
So until you hit hell.
Yeah,

1248
01:05:35,590 --> 01:05:37,750
but you could go.
You could have 100 levels of tunnel.

1249
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:39,670
Their bombs.
Jesus Christ.

1250
01:05:39,671 --> 01:05:42,400
I don't want to be a 99 man.
It'd be the 99th,

1251
01:05:42,430 --> 01:05:45,430
negative 99 floors.
Cool.

1252
01:05:45,990 --> 01:05:49,860
This is one of the fundamental things 
people don't appreciate about tunnels is

1253
01:05:49,861 --> 01:05:52,440
that there's not like roads.
The fundamental issue with roads is that

1254
01:05:52,441 --> 01:05:57,441
you have a tutee transport system and a 
three d living in workspace environment.

1255
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:01,160
So you've got all these tall buildings 
or,

1256
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:06,380
or concentrated work environments and,
and then then you want to go into this 

1257
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:12,080
like tootie transport system,
which usually in a pretty low density 

1258
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:14,660
because cars are spaced out pretty far.
Um,

1259
01:06:14,820 --> 01:06:19,820
and,
and so that obviously is not going to 

1260
01:06:19,820 --> 01:06:19,820
work.
You're going to have traffic guaranteed.

1261
01:06:19,820 --> 01:06:21,990
But if you can go three D on your 
transport system,

1262
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:27,770
then you can solve all traffic and you 
can either go 3d up with a flying car or

1263
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:33,610
can go through ed down with tunnels and 
you can have as many tunnel levels as 

1264
01:06:33,610 --> 01:06:36,900
you want and you can arbitrarily relieve
any amount of traffic.

1265
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:40,770
You can go further down with tunnels.
Then you can go up with buildings.

1266
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:42,990
You're 10,000
feet down if you want.

1267
01:06:45,270 --> 01:06:48,150
I wouldn't recommend it,
but what was that movie with?

1268
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:50,370
What's his face?
The Bradley Cooper.

1269
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,830
Not Bradley Cooper.
A Christian.

1270
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:55,380
Now what the fuck is his name?
Who Was Batman?

1271
01:06:56,250 --> 01:06:57,500
Christian Bale.
Where he.

1272
01:06:57,930 --> 01:07:02,930
They fought dragons.
Him and Matthew Mcconaughey went down 

1273
01:07:02,930 --> 01:07:03,570
deep into the earth.
How high?

1274
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,730
How deep can you go up man,
but yeah,

1275
01:07:05,731 --> 01:07:07,770
it was.
It was meant for dragons.

1276
01:07:08,570 --> 01:07:10,050
Batman,
but Christian Bale Reign.

1277
01:07:10,070 --> 01:07:11,910
A fire ring of fire.
Never saw that.

1278
01:07:12,910 --> 01:07:15,870
No,
but good.

1279
01:07:16,410 --> 01:07:18,720
I wouldn't recommend saying super far 
down.

1280
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:21,300
Right?
Molten.

1281
01:07:21,450 --> 01:07:22,230
We're.
Yeah.

1282
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:25,140
Earth is a giant bowl of lava

1283
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:30,100
with a thin crust on the top,
which we think of as like the surface,

1284
01:07:30,210 --> 01:07:34,570
this thin crust and it's mostly just a 
big ball of lava

1285
01:07:36,770 --> 01:07:39,410
that's earth,
but 10,000

1286
01:07:39,411 --> 01:07:40,190
feet.
It's not a big deal.

1287
01:07:40,490 --> 01:07:45,490
Have you given any consideration 
whatsoever to the flat Earth Movement 

1288
01:07:45,490 --> 01:07:48,860
thought?
I think that's a troll situation.

1289
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:49,970
Oh,
it's not.

1290
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:51,620
No,
it's not.

1291
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:55,040
You would like to think because you're a
super genius,

1292
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:58,580
but I as a normal,
normal person,

1293
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:02,270
I know there's people way dumber than me
and they really,

1294
01:08:02,390 --> 01:08:07,390
really believe.
They watch youtube videos which go on 

1295
01:08:07,390 --> 01:08:11,051
uninterrupted and spew out a bunch of 
fucking fake vacs very eloquently and 

1296
01:08:11,051 --> 01:08:14,680
articulately and they really believe 
these people.

1297
01:08:14,681 --> 01:08:16,010
Really.
I mean,

1298
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:16,820
if it works for them,

1299
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:17,990
sure,

1300
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:21,730
fine,
fine.

1301
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:26,880
Weird that right.
That in this age where you know it was 

1302
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,660
ludicrous mode and your car goes one 
point nine seconds.

1303
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:32,230
Zero to 62 point two,
two point two.

1304
01:08:32,260 --> 01:08:34,330
Which one's one point nine?
The poster.

1305
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:36,910
The next generation roadster.
Certain standard edition.

1306
01:08:36,911 --> 01:08:38,410
Yeah.
I'm on top of this shit.

1307
01:08:39,170 --> 01:08:42,820
That's the standard edition.
So throughout the performance package,

1308
01:08:42,970 --> 01:08:47,970
what performance package?
What the fuck do you need me to put 

1309
01:08:47,970 --> 01:08:50,230
rocket thrusters on it?
For Real?

1310
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:54,310
What are they going to burn?
I think high ultra high pressure.

1311
01:08:54,970 --> 01:08:56,470
Compressed air.
Well,

1312
01:08:56,650 --> 01:09:00,340
just cold gas thrusters new.
Do you have to have air tanks?

1313
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:02,000
Are they sucking the air out?
Okay?

1314
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:03,550
Yeah,
just electric pump.

1315
01:09:03,810 --> 01:09:05,530
Whoa.
Pump it up like 10,000

1316
01:09:05,531 --> 01:09:07,180
PSI.
And how fast are we talking?

1317
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:10,590
Zero to 60.
How fast you want to go to go?

1318
01:09:10,610 --> 01:09:15,610
Could make it fly.
I want to go back in time to make it 

1319
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:15,610
fly.

1320
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:15,610
You make it fly?
Sure.

1321
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:20,820
Do you anticipate that as being me,
you were talking about the tunnels and 

1322
01:09:20,820 --> 01:09:23,521
then flying cars,
do you really think that's going to be 

1323
01:09:23,521 --> 01:09:25,231
real too noisy and this too much air 
flow so that the fundamental issue with 

1324
01:09:25,231 --> 01:09:29,821
flying cars,
I mean I forget what one of those like 

1325
01:09:29,821 --> 01:09:30,580
toy drones,
I think of how much,

1326
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,960
how loud those are and how much air 
that.

1327
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:39,270
How much air they blow.
Now imagine if that's like a thousand 

1328
01:09:39,270 --> 01:09:42,091
times heavier.
This is not going to be make your 

1329
01:09:42,091 --> 01:09:45,391
neighbors happy.
Your neighbors are not going to be 

1330
01:09:45,391 --> 01:09:48,241
happy.
If you land a flying car in your 

1331
01:09:48,241 --> 01:09:49,900
backyard,
it will be very helicopter or on your 

1332
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:50,110
roof.
They're just really going to be like,

1333
01:09:50,140 --> 01:09:54,310
what the hell that it was annoying.
You can't even look.

1334
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,970
If you want a flying car,
just put some wheels on a helicopter.

1335
01:09:58,540 --> 01:10:03,540
Is there a way around that?
Like what if they figure out some sort 

1336
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:06,331
of magnetic technology,
like all those Bob Lazard type 

1337
01:10:06,331 --> 01:10:09,960
characters were thinking that was a part
of the UFO technology they were doing at

1338
01:10:09,970 --> 01:10:11,430
area 51.
Remember,

1339
01:10:11,450 --> 01:10:14,500
didn't they have some,
some thoughts about magnetics?

1340
01:10:14,650 --> 01:10:16,150
Nope,
no bullshit.

1341
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:17,370
Yes.
Really?

1342
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:22,460
Yeah.
It was a fundamental momentum exchange 

1343
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:22,460
with the air,
so you must.

1344
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:26,720
You must accelerate your business like 
this.

1345
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:29,320
There's a certain.
You have a mess and you have gravity,

1346
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:34,350
gravitational acceleration and mass mass
times your mass times gravity must equal

1347
01:10:37,511 --> 01:10:42,511
the massive air flow times the 
acceleration of that f flow to have a 

1348
01:10:42,511 --> 01:10:44,140
neutral force,
so it's impossible to go around and then

1349
01:10:44,141 --> 01:10:49,141
you won't move.
If FMG is greater than you will go down 

1350
01:10:49,390 --> 01:10:51,400
and if mas greater than mg you will go 
up.

1351
01:10:52,350 --> 01:10:54,580
That's how it works.
There's just no way around that.

1352
01:10:54,670 --> 01:10:59,670
There is definitely no way around it.
There's no way to create some sort of a 

1353
01:10:59,670 --> 01:11:02,881
magnetic something or another that 
allows you to technically yes,

1354
01:11:03,590 --> 01:11:08,590
you you could have a strong enough 
magnet,

1355
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:16,540
but that magnet would be strong,
that you would create a lot of trouble.

1356
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:20,910
We just suck cars up in your car.
Just pickup.

1357
01:11:21,530 --> 01:11:26,530
I mean,
you'd have to repel off of either a 

1358
01:11:26,530 --> 01:11:31,250
material on the ground or in a really 
nasty situation off of Earth's 

1359
01:11:33,781 --> 01:11:37,680
gravitational field and somehow make 
that incredibly light,

1360
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:40,890
but that magnet would cause so much 
destruction.

1361
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:46,010
You'd be better off with a helicopter.
So if there was some sort of magnet 

1362
01:11:46,771 --> 01:11:49,980
road,
like you have two magnets and they repel

1363
01:11:49,981 --> 01:11:54,981
each other.
If you had some sort of a magnet road 

1364
01:11:54,981 --> 01:11:55,350
that was below you and you could travel 
on that magnet road,

1365
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:56,730
that would work.

1366
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:02,040
Yes.
Yes.

1367
01:12:02,041 --> 01:12:04,520
You could have a magnet road,
a magnet road because that too.

1368
01:12:04,521 --> 01:12:05,520
Ridiculous.
No,

1369
01:12:05,521 --> 01:12:07,830
it's ridiculous to.
Right.

1370
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:12,890
I would not recommend it.
There's a lot of things I don't 

1371
01:12:12,890 --> 01:12:14,130
recommend or not recommend that not 
good.

1372
01:12:14,490 --> 01:12:16,430
Not Wise.
I think no roads.

1373
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:18,420
No,
no that.

1374
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:20,940
No,
definitely not.

1375
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:22,430
Definitely not.
I was good.

1376
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:27,440
I would cause a lot of trouble.
So you've put some time and 

1377
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:27,440
consideration into this other than,
you know,

1378
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:31,440
instead of like my foolishly rendered 
thoughts.

1379
01:12:31,710 --> 01:12:33,420
So you think that tunnels of the way to 
do it?

1380
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:34,800
Oh,
it'll work for sure.

1381
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:36,030
That'll work.
Yes.

1382
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:39,610
And your,
these,

1383
01:12:39,990 --> 01:12:41,550
these tunnels that you're building right
now,

1384
01:12:41,551 --> 01:12:46,551
these are basically just like test 
versions of this ultimate idea that you 

1385
01:12:46,551 --> 01:12:47,370
have,
you know,

1386
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:49,270
it's just a hole in the ground,
right?

1387
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:54,240
We played videos of it where you're 
going to drop that hole in the ground,

1388
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:56,880
there's a sled on it and the sled goes 
very fast.

1389
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,620
Like 100 miles an hour plus.
Yeah,

1390
01:12:58,621 --> 01:13:00,360
you can go real fast,
fast as you want.

1391
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:06,710
And then if you want to go long 
distances you can just grow the air out 

1392
01:13:06,710 --> 01:13:06,720
of the tunnel,
make sure it's real straight.

1393
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:09,790
Draw the air of the tunnel.
Yeah.

1394
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:11,850
So vacuum tunnel,
um,

1395
01:13:12,110 --> 01:13:15,280
because the.
And then depending on how fast you wanna

1396
01:13:15,290 --> 01:13:20,290
go,
you can either use wheels or you could 

1397
01:13:20,290 --> 01:13:21,720
use air bearings depending upon the 
ambient pressure in the tunnel.

1398
01:13:21,721 --> 01:13:25,560
Or You could a maglev it if you want to 
go super fast.

1399
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:29,610
So magnet road,
yes,

1400
01:13:30,090 --> 01:13:32,260
but underground magnet roads,
underground magnet,

1401
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:37,300
otherwise you're going to really create 
a lot of trouble with because those 

1402
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:37,980
metal things.
So magnet rose the way to go.

1403
01:13:37,981 --> 01:13:41,130
Just underground.
Do you want to go really fast?

1404
01:13:41,770 --> 01:13:43,800
Underground?
You would be in a,

1405
01:13:43,810 --> 01:13:47,910
you would be maglev in a vacuum tunnel,
mag in a vacuum tunnel,

1406
01:13:47,970 --> 01:13:50,040
magnetic levitation in a backroom,
tunnel entrance.

1407
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:56,200
Fun with rocket launchers.
Now I would not recommend putting any 

1408
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:57,570
exhaust gas in the tunnel.
Oh,

1409
01:13:57,750 --> 01:14:02,750
okay.
I see what you're saying because then 

1410
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:02,750
you have to pump it on,
right?

1411
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:05,691
You have to pump it out and you probably
have a limited amount of air in the 

1412
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:05,691
first place.
Like how much can you breathe?

1413
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:09,970
Do you have to pump oxygen into these 
cubicles of the pressurized pod and be 

1414
01:14:09,970 --> 01:14:11,040
like,
like a little tiny underground.

1415
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:11,980
Basically

1416
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:15,330
like an airplane because you have a or 
an airplane.

1417
01:14:15,331 --> 01:14:17,170
It's not getting new Aaron.
It is.

1418
01:14:17,410 --> 01:14:18,190
It is,
yes.

1419
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:20,100
We have like a little hole.
Yeah,

1420
01:14:20,110 --> 01:14:21,220
they have a pump.
Really?

1421
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:22,540
Yeah.
It gets it from the outside.

1422
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:23,410
Yes.
Wow.

1423
01:14:23,411 --> 01:14:26,690
I didn't know that was like,
it's the airplanes have it.

1424
01:14:26,790 --> 01:14:29,470
Have it easy because essentially you 
can.

1425
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:32,620
They're pretty leaky but Jesus.
Yeah,

1426
01:14:32,621 --> 01:14:37,621
but so long as they.
As long as the air pump is working at a 

1427
01:14:38,081 --> 01:14:39,550
decent speed,
they have backup pumps.

1428
01:14:40,010 --> 01:14:43,500
Still have like three pumps to four 
pumps or something and uh,

1429
01:14:43,590 --> 01:14:45,340
and then that,
then there's like,

1430
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:50,380
there's,
it exhausts through the outflow valve 

1431
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:55,800
and,
and through whatever seals are not 

1432
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:58,741
feeling quite right.
Usually the door doesn't feel quite 

1433
01:14:58,741 --> 01:15:01,291
right on a plane.
This was a bit of leakage around the 

1434
01:15:01,291 --> 01:15:01,840
door and uh,
but the,

1435
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:06,460
the pumps a exceed the flow rate and 
then that sets the pressure in the,

1436
01:15:06,461 --> 01:15:07,180
in the cabin.

1437
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:10,720
Now,
have you ever looked at and gone,

1438
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:15,750
I can fix this,
but I just don't have time as you make 

1439
01:15:15,750 --> 01:15:18,490
them a design for a plane,
you do a better design.

1440
01:15:19,210 --> 01:15:22,380
I mean probably I think it is.
Well,

1441
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:27,400
have you talked to about this and I've 
talked to friends,

1442
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:29,750
friends,
friends and family,

1443
01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:30,760
friends,
girlfriends,

1444
01:15:30,761 --> 01:15:35,590
and you can tell me what do you got?
What's going on?

1445
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:38,710
Well,
I mean the exciting thing to do would be

1446
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:42,220
some sort of electric vertical takeoff 
and landing supersonic,

1447
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:47,820
jet up,
some kind of vertical takeoff and 

1448
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:49,351
landing mean no need for runway.
Just shoot up straight in the air and 

1449
01:15:49,351 --> 01:15:49,351
then,

1450
01:15:49,351 --> 01:15:49,600
Ooh,

1451
01:15:50,590 --> 01:15:55,590
how'd you do that?
When they do that and some military 

1452
01:15:55,590 --> 01:15:56,110
aircrafts,
correct?

1453
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,550
Yes.
The trick is that you have,

1454
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:02,690
you have to transition to level flight 
and then you the the,

1455
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:08,020
the thing that you'd use for vertical 
Tafe will take over and landing is not 

1456
01:16:08,890 --> 01:16:10,810
suitable for high speed flight,

1457
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:17,460
so you have two different systems where 
thought about this quite a lot.

1458
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:24,460
The interesting thing about an electric 
plane is that you want to go as high as 

1459
01:16:24,460 --> 01:16:25,810
possible,
but you need a certain energy density in

1460
01:16:25,811 --> 01:16:30,220
the battery pack because you have to 
overcome gravitational potential energy.

1461
01:16:30,221 --> 01:16:35,221
Once you've overcome gravitational 
potential energy and you're at at at at 

1462
01:16:35,221 --> 01:16:38,431
a high altitude,
the energy use in cruise is very low and

1463
01:16:38,651 --> 01:16:41,050
then you could recapture a large part of
your,

1464
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:43,330
the gravitational potential energy on 
the way down.

1465
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:47,320
So you really don't need any kind of 
reserve fuel,

1466
01:16:47,321 --> 01:16:49,120
if you will,
because you have the,

1467
01:16:49,350 --> 01:16:52,060
the energy of height,
gravitational potential energy.

1468
01:16:52,930 --> 01:16:55,000
This is a lot of energy.
So.

1469
01:16:56,150 --> 01:17:01,050
So once you can get high the high you 
like the way to think about a plane,

1470
01:17:01,051 --> 01:17:06,051
it is.
It's a force balance to the force 

1471
01:17:06,051 --> 01:17:08,410
balance.
So a plane that is not accelerating,

1472
01:17:09,030 --> 01:17:09,530
um,
is,

1473
01:17:09,610 --> 01:17:13,460
is a neutral force balance at the force 
of gravity.

1474
01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:18,730
If the lift force with the wings,
then you've got the force of the one of 

1475
01:17:19,071 --> 01:17:24,071
the thrusting device,
so the propeller or turbine or whatever 

1476
01:17:24,071 --> 01:17:28,721
it is,
and you've got the resistance force of 

1477
01:17:28,721 --> 01:17:29,060
the air.
Now the higher you go,

1478
01:17:29,330 --> 01:17:31,310
the lower the error assistance.
Yes,

1479
01:17:32,030 --> 01:17:37,030
air density drops exponentially,
but drag increases with the square and 

1480
01:17:37,221 --> 01:17:39,860
exponential beats of square.
The higher you go,

1481
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,990
the faster you will go for the same 
amount of energy

1482
01:17:43,810 --> 01:17:48,810
and at a certain altitude you can go 
supersonic with less energy per mile,

1483
01:17:49,511 --> 01:17:54,190
quite a lot less energy per mile.
Then an aircraft at 35,000

1484
01:17:54,191 --> 01:17:59,191
feet because it's just a force balance.
I'm just doing it for this conversation.

1485
01:18:04,390 --> 01:18:04,990
It makes sense.

1486
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:06,470
No,
I'm sure it does.

1487
01:18:07,010 --> 01:18:11,390
Now,
when you think about this new idea of,

1488
01:18:11,391 --> 01:18:12,580
of,
of designing it,

1489
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:13,320
when,
when,

1490
01:18:13,450 --> 01:18:16,040
when you have this idea about improving 
planes,

1491
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:22,020
are you going to bring this to somebody 
or you just chuck a lot on my plate,

1492
01:18:22,290 --> 01:18:23,370
right?
This what I'm saying?

1493
01:18:24,870 --> 01:18:27,210
I don't know.
I don't know how you do what you do now,

1494
01:18:27,211 --> 01:18:31,170
but if you keep coming up with these,
but it's got to be hard to pawn this off

1495
01:18:31,171 --> 01:18:32,110
on someone else,
either a,

1496
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:33,540
hey,
go do a job.

1497
01:18:33,590 --> 01:18:38,590
A good job with this vertical takeoff 
and landing system that I want to 

1498
01:18:38,611 --> 01:18:40,170
implement into regular planes.

1499
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:44,570
They're playing electric airplane isn't 
necessarily right now.

1500
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:49,220
Electric cars are important and we need 
to source energy is important.

1501
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:51,350
Stationary storage of energy is 
important.

1502
01:18:51,380 --> 01:18:53,960
These things are much more important 
than creating electric supersonic,

1503
01:18:53,961 --> 01:18:56,420
fetal.
Also,

1504
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:02,150
the planes naturally you really want 
that gravitational energy density for an

1505
01:19:02,151 --> 01:19:03,080
aircraft.
Um,

1506
01:19:03,081 --> 01:19:08,081
and this is improving over time.
So it's important that we accelerate the

1507
01:19:08,461 --> 01:19:12,980
transition to sustainable energy.
That's why electric cars and matters,

1508
01:19:12,981 --> 01:19:14,720
whether electric cars happen sooner or 
later,

1509
01:19:16,060 --> 01:19:16,400
you know,
we're,

1510
01:19:16,401 --> 01:19:21,401
we're really playing the crazy game here
with the atmosphere or the oceans were 

1511
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:28,310
taking vast amounts of carbon from deep 
ground and putting this,

1512
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:33,270
putting this neat and the atmosphere was
crazy.

1513
01:19:33,890 --> 01:19:37,360
We should not do this.
It's very dangerous.

1514
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:42,090
So we should,
we should,

1515
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:44,610
we should accelerate the transition to 
sustainable energy.

1516
01:19:47,310 --> 01:19:52,310
I mean this,
the bizarre thing is that obviously 

1517
01:19:52,310 --> 01:19:53,170
we're going to run out of oil in long 
term.

1518
01:19:53,970 --> 01:19:54,420
You know,
we're going to.

1519
01:19:54,450 --> 01:19:57,090
There's only so much oil we can.
We can mine it burn.

1520
01:19:58,730 --> 01:20:01,500
It's total logical.
We must have to sustainable energy,

1521
01:20:01,501 --> 01:20:06,501
transport and energy infrastructure in 
the longterm so we know that's the end 

1522
01:20:06,501 --> 01:20:06,501
point.
We know that.

1523
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:12,080
So why I run this crazy experiment where
we take trillions of tons of carbon from

1524
01:20:12,121 --> 01:20:15,000
underground and put it in the atmosphere
and oceans.

1525
01:20:15,030 --> 01:20:20,030
This isn't insane experiment.
It's the dumbest experiment in human 

1526
01:20:20,030 --> 01:20:22,270
history.
Why are we doing this?

1527
01:20:22,470 --> 01:20:23,140
It's crazy.

1528
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:30,560
Do you think this is a product of 
momentum that we started off doing this 

1529
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:33,981
when it was just a few engines,
a few hundred million gallons of fuel 

1530
01:20:33,991 --> 01:20:38,991
over the whole world,
not that big of a deal and then slowly 

1531
01:20:38,991 --> 01:20:41,940
but surely over a century it got out of 
control and now it it.

1532
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:47,120
It's not just our fuel,
but it's also the fossil fuels are 

1533
01:20:48,871 --> 01:20:51,180
involved in so many different 
electronics,

1534
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:56,480
so many different items that people buy.
It's just this constant desire for 

1535
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:58,560
fossil fuels,
constant need for oil,

1536
01:21:00,410 --> 01:21:04,190
without consideration of the 
sustainability thing is like oil,

1537
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:05,300
oil,
coal,

1538
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:08,180
gas will the easy money.
It's easy money.

1539
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:12,750
So have you heard about clean coal?
The president's been tweeting about.

1540
01:21:12,770 --> 01:21:15,050
It's got to be real clean coal.
All caps.

1541
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:18,680
Did you see he used all caps,
clean coal.

1542
01:21:18,860 --> 01:21:20,840
Um,
well,

1543
01:21:23,590 --> 01:21:28,590
you know,
it's very difficult to put that CEO to 

1544
01:21:28,590 --> 01:21:28,700
back in the ground.
It doesn't like being in solid form.

1545
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:31,580
Have you thought about energy like that?
Like some sort of a filter,

1546
01:21:31,850 --> 01:21:35,390
giant building sized filter socks,
carbon out of the atmosphere.

1547
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:37,700
Is that possible?
No.

1548
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:39,110
No,
he doesn't talk possible.

1549
01:21:39,350 --> 01:21:39,980
Nope.
Nope.

1550
01:21:39,981 --> 01:21:40,610
No,
nope.

1551
01:21:40,611 --> 01:21:42,790
Definitely not fucked.
No,

1552
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,570
we're not fucked.

1553
01:21:48,620 --> 01:21:50,570
I mean,
this is a quite a complex question,

1554
01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:53,330
right?
You know,

1555
01:21:53,331 --> 01:21:58,331
we're really just,
when the more carbon we take out of the 

1556
01:21:58,331 --> 01:22:02,411
ground and add to the atmosphere and a 
lot of it gets permeated into the 

1557
01:22:02,411 --> 01:22:04,280
oceans,
the more dangerous it is.

1558
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:08,360
Like I don't think right now.
I think we're okay right now.

1559
01:22:08,990 --> 01:22:13,990
We can probably even add some more,
but the momentum towards sustainable 

1560
01:22:14,301 --> 01:22:19,301
energy is too slow like that.
There's a vast base of industry,

1561
01:22:21,620 --> 01:22:26,620
vast transportation system like this,
this two and a half billion cars and 

1562
01:22:26,620 --> 01:22:28,640
trucks in the world,
so and,

1563
01:22:28,650 --> 01:22:29,300
and,
and the,

1564
01:22:29,330 --> 01:22:32,930
the new car and truck production.
If it was 100 percent electric,

1565
01:22:33,530 --> 01:22:38,210
that's only about $100 million per year.
So it would take,

1566
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:43,300
if you could snap your fingers and 
instantly turn all old cars and trucks,

1567
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:50,200
electric,
it would still take 25 years to change 

1568
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:50,200
the transport based to electric.

1569
01:22:52,470 --> 01:22:56,120
Makes sense because how long does it 
truck car truck last before it goes into

1570
01:22:56,121 --> 01:22:59,060
the junkyard and gets crushed about 20 
to 25 years.

1571
01:23:00,050 --> 01:23:01,910
Is there a way to accelerate that 
process,

1572
01:23:01,911 --> 01:23:06,911
like some sort of subsidies or some 
encouragement from the government 

1573
01:23:06,911 --> 01:23:09,100
financially?
Well,

1574
01:23:09,230 --> 01:23:14,230
the thing that is going on right now is 
that there is an inherit subsidy in any 

1575
01:23:14,350 --> 01:23:16,600
oil burning device.
Any,

1576
01:23:16,630 --> 01:23:21,630
any power plant or car is fundamentally 
a consuming the carbon capacity of the 

1577
01:23:25,030 --> 01:23:28,600
oceans and atmosphere or just say 
atmosphere for short.

1578
01:23:28,770 --> 01:23:30,520
Um,
so like you can say like,

1579
01:23:30,550 --> 01:23:35,550
okay,
there's a certain probability of 

1580
01:23:35,550 --> 01:23:39,121
something bad happening past a certain 
carbon concentration in the atmosphere,

1581
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:46,080
and so there's some uncertain number 
where if we put too much carbon in the 

1582
01:23:46,631 --> 01:23:48,490
atmosphere,
things overheat,

1583
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:53,410
a oceans warm up,
ice caps melt,

1584
01:23:54,730 --> 01:23:59,130
ocean real estate becomes a lot less 
valuable underwater.

1585
01:24:01,070 --> 01:24:03,220
And,
but it's not clear what that number is,

1586
01:24:03,221 --> 01:24:05,120
but it's definitely a scientists with 
all.

1587
01:24:05,310 --> 01:24:10,310
It's really quite the scientists.
The scientific consensus is 

1588
01:24:10,310 --> 01:24:13,900
overwhelming.
I'm overwhelming.

1589
01:24:13,970 --> 01:24:17,020
I mean,
I don't know any serious scientists,

1590
01:24:17,021 --> 01:24:20,840
actually zero,
literally zero who don't think that,

1591
01:24:22,220 --> 01:24:22,850
you know,
that.

1592
01:24:22,910 --> 01:24:27,670
But we have quite a serious climate risk
that we're facing.

1593
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:33,300
And so that's fundamentally a subsidy 
occurring with every fossil fuel burning

1594
01:24:37,061 --> 01:24:42,061
thing,
power plants per aircraft car.

1595
01:24:42,550 --> 01:24:44,710
Frankly,
even rockets rockets use,

1596
01:24:44,711 --> 01:24:45,550
uh,
you know,

1597
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:46,990
they burn,
they burn fuel,

1598
01:24:48,190 --> 01:24:48,940
but there's just,
you know,

1599
01:24:48,941 --> 01:24:53,941
with rockets,
there's just no other way to get to 

1600
01:24:53,941 --> 01:24:54,610
orbit unfortunately.
So it's the only way.

1601
01:24:55,300 --> 01:25:00,300
But with cars there's definitely a 
better way with electric cars and to 

1602
01:25:00,670 --> 01:25:05,670
generate the energy,
do so with multiple tax because we've 

1603
01:25:05,670 --> 01:25:08,881
got a giant.
Then when you clear reactor in the sky 

1604
01:25:08,881 --> 01:25:11,221
called the sun,
it's great sort of shows I've everyday 

1605
01:25:11,221 --> 01:25:14,650
very reliable.
So if you can generate energy from solar

1606
01:25:14,651 --> 01:25:18,010
panels stored with batteries,
you can have energy 24 hours a day,

1607
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:22,540
um,
and then you can,

1608
01:25:23,170 --> 01:25:28,170
you know,
consented to the polls ordinate near to 

1609
01:25:28,170 --> 01:25:28,170
the north,
uh,

1610
01:25:28,170 --> 01:25:30,930
with know high voltage lines.
Also,

1611
01:25:30,950 --> 01:25:31,570
the north,
northern,

1612
01:25:31,571 --> 01:25:36,040
northern parts of the world tend to have
a lot of hydropower as well.

1613
01:25:37,230 --> 01:25:38,340
Um,
but anyway,

1614
01:25:38,350 --> 01:25:43,350
that all fossil fuel power things have 
an inherent subsidy which is their 

1615
01:25:43,350 --> 01:25:46,690
consumption of the carbon capacity of 
the atmosphere and oceans.

1616
01:25:48,790 --> 01:25:51,460
So people tend to think of like,
why?

1617
01:25:51,610 --> 01:25:54,100
Why should electric vehicles have a 
subsidy?

1618
01:25:54,101 --> 01:25:59,101
But they're not taking into account.
That's all fossil fuel book burning 

1619
01:25:59,530 --> 01:26:03,650
vehicles fundamentally are subsidized by
cost,

1620
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:09,010
the environmental cost to earth,
but nobody's paying for it.

1621
01:26:09,630 --> 01:26:14,630
We are going to pay for it.
Obviously in the future we will pay for 

1622
01:26:14,630 --> 01:26:15,740
it.
It's just not paid for now.

1623
01:26:16,850 --> 01:26:21,850
Now,
what is the bottleneck in regards to 

1624
01:26:21,850 --> 01:26:22,310
electric cars and trucks and things like
that?

1625
01:26:22,311 --> 01:26:23,660
Is it battery capacity?

1626
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:27,260
Yeah,
I've got a scale up production.

1627
01:26:27,950 --> 01:26:32,950
Got To make the car compelling,
make it better than gasoline or diesel 

1628
01:26:33,771 --> 01:26:38,771
cars.
Make it more efficient in terms of like 

1629
01:26:38,771 --> 01:26:38,771
the distance it can travel.
Yeah.

1630
01:26:38,771 --> 01:26:39,230
You got to be able to go far,
far enough,

1631
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:41,240
recharge fast.
And you're roadster,

1632
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:43,880
you're,
you're anticipating 600 miles.

1633
01:26:43,881 --> 01:26:46,330
Is that correct?
Yeah.

1634
01:26:46,830 --> 01:26:47,240
Yeah,
we,

1635
01:26:47,550 --> 01:26:49,910
what is it,
600 mile right now,

1636
01:26:49,911 --> 01:26:52,810
like if you driven one 600 miles now?
No,

1637
01:26:52,820 --> 01:26:54,830
we can totally make one right now that 
will do 600 miles.

1638
01:26:54,831 --> 01:26:59,360
But the thing is too expensive,
so it's like the cars but it's more so.

1639
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:05,270
Well just have a 200 kilowatt hour 
battery pack and you can go 600 miles.

1640
01:27:06,140 --> 01:27:11,140
What do you have now?
Three hundred and 30 mile range,

1641
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:14,120
but that's what does that in terms of 
kilowatts?

1642
01:27:15,410 --> 01:27:20,270
Well that would be for a model s a 100 
kilowatt hour pack.

1643
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:23,270
We'll do about 330 miles,
maybe 3:35,

1644
01:27:23,510 --> 01:27:26,590
but some people have hyper mild at to 
500 miles.

1645
01:27:26,620 --> 01:27:31,620
Hyper mild.
It would go on 45 miles an hour or 

1646
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:31,620
something.
Yeah,

1647
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:36,131
like 30 miles an hour.
So it was like on level ground with a 

1648
01:27:36,131 --> 01:27:39,680
pump the tires up really well and go on 
a smooth surface and then you can go for

1649
01:27:39,681 --> 01:27:44,681
a long time.
But like definitely comfortably do 300 

1650
01:27:44,681 --> 01:27:46,910
miles easier.
This is fine for most people.

1651
01:27:47,810 --> 01:27:51,170
Usually 200 or 250 miles is fine.
Three hundred miles is.

1652
01:27:51,980 --> 01:27:56,980
You don't even think about it really.
Is there any possibility that you could 

1653
01:27:56,980 --> 01:27:59,000
use solar power solar powered one day?
Especially in Los Angeles.

1654
01:27:59,270 --> 01:28:04,270
I mean as you said about that giant 
nuclear reactor a million times bigger 

1655
01:28:04,270 --> 01:28:04,270
than earth.
Just floating in the sky.

1656
01:28:04,270 --> 01:28:07,610
Is it possible that one day you'll be 
able to just power all these cars?

1657
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:11,960
Just on solar power.
I mean we don't ever have cloudy days if

1658
01:28:11,961 --> 01:28:13,360
we do this,
three of them.

1659
01:28:14,990 --> 01:28:17,420
Well the surface area of a car is

1660
01:28:19,290 --> 01:28:22,920
without making the car like really 
blocky or having some.

1661
01:28:22,921 --> 01:28:24,570
Like a g wagon?
Yeah.

1662
01:28:24,571 --> 01:28:25,230
Like,
and,

1663
01:28:25,340 --> 01:28:28,020
and just like having to look a lot of 
surface area where like maybe like solar

1664
01:28:28,021 --> 01:28:30,460
panels fold out or something like your 
class.

1665
01:28:31,470 --> 01:28:33,660
That's what we needed.
The type.

1666
01:28:33,810 --> 01:28:38,810
Yeah,
that the e a Jaguar e type with a giant 

1667
01:28:38,810 --> 01:28:39,840
long hood.
That could be a giant solar panel.

1668
01:28:40,380 --> 01:28:45,380
What the beginning of the Tesla did want
to have this like unfolding solar panel 

1669
01:28:45,380 --> 01:28:49,131
thing.
They'd press a button and it will just 

1670
01:28:49,131 --> 01:28:49,131
unfold these solar panels.
I'm like,

1671
01:28:49,131 --> 01:28:50,280
charge,
recharge your car in the parking lot.

1672
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:52,860
Ah Yeah,
we could do that,

1673
01:28:52,861 --> 01:28:55,800
but I think it's probably better to just
put that on your roof.

1674
01:28:56,100 --> 01:29:01,100
Right.
And then it's gonna be facing the sun 

1675
01:29:01,100 --> 01:29:01,560
all the time because otherwise you're to
be in shade,

1676
01:29:01,561 --> 01:29:02,400
you know?
It could be in the shade,

1677
01:29:02,401 --> 01:29:03,730
a community garage or something like 
that.

1678
01:29:03,810 --> 01:29:05,760
Yeah.
Didn't the fisker have that on the roof?

1679
01:29:05,790 --> 01:29:09,300
The fisker Karma.
New Generation for,

1680
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:13,680
I believe it was only for the radio.
Is that correct?

1681
01:29:13,740 --> 01:29:18,740
Yeah,
I mean I think it could like reach out 

1682
01:29:18,740 --> 01:29:21,511
like two miles a day or something.
Did you laugh when they started blowing 

1683
01:29:21,511 --> 01:29:21,511
up?
When they get hit with water?

1684
01:29:21,511 --> 01:29:23,880
Do you remember what happened?
They got the what the,

1685
01:29:24,050 --> 01:29:28,920
when they had a dealership,
fisker Karma is we're parked.

1686
01:29:28,980 --> 01:29:30,900
Is that like that with a flood in 
jersey?

1687
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:35,580
When the hurricane came in,
they got overwhelmed with water and they

1688
01:29:35,581 --> 01:29:38,190
all started exploding.
Is fucking great video of it.

1689
01:29:38,220 --> 01:29:40,710
Did you watch the video?
Watch the video,

1690
01:29:40,711 --> 01:29:44,460
but I did see a picture of the actual 
lubed up.

1691
01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:47,880
Watch that video.
Laugh my ass off.

1692
01:29:47,910 --> 01:29:50,670
They all blow up.
They got wet and they blew up.

1693
01:29:50,700 --> 01:29:52,260
That's not good.
Yeah.

1694
01:29:52,261 --> 01:29:53,010
We made out battery.

1695
01:29:53,010 --> 01:29:54,240
Waterproof,
so that doesn't happen.

1696
01:29:54,241 --> 01:29:56,610
Smart move.
Yeah.

1697
01:29:56,611 --> 01:30:01,170
There was a guy in Kazakhstan that I 
think it was Kazakhstan,

1698
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:05,040
that he.
He just bolted through a tunnel under an

1699
01:30:05,041 --> 01:30:10,041
underwater tunnel that could flooded 
tunnel and just turn the wheels to steer

1700
01:30:10,740 --> 01:30:15,740
and pressed the accelerator and it just 
floated through the tunnel and he 

1701
01:30:15,740 --> 01:30:16,770
smiled,
steered around the other cars and you're

1702
01:30:16,771 --> 01:30:17,870
like,
that's amazing.

1703
01:30:17,930 --> 01:30:22,930
On the Internet.
What happens if your car gets a little 

1704
01:30:22,930 --> 01:30:24,030
sideways?
Like if you're driving in snow,

1705
01:30:24,210 --> 01:30:29,210
like what if you're driving.
If you're autopilot is on and you're in 

1706
01:30:29,210 --> 01:30:32,310
Denver and it snows out and your car 
gets a little sideways,

1707
01:30:32,910 --> 01:30:36,540
does it correct itself?
It's got great traction control,

1708
01:30:36,690 --> 01:30:38,310
but doesn't know how to like.
Correct.

1709
01:30:38,470 --> 01:30:39,340
Do you know how like,
Oh yeah,

1710
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:41,520
your ass and kicked out.
You know how to counter steer.

1711
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:42,780
Oh yeah.
No,

1712
01:30:42,781 --> 01:30:43,290
that's really good.

1713
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:44,330
He knows how to do it.
Yeah,

1714
01:30:45,660 --> 01:30:47,490
it's pretty crazy.
That's pretty crazy.

1715
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:50,190
Yeah,
so like if you're going sideways,

1716
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:54,990
he knows how to correct itself.
It generally won't go sideways.

1717
01:30:55,020 --> 01:31:00,020
It won't know why not.
It will correct itself before it goes 

1718
01:31:00,020 --> 01:31:00,020
sideways.
Even in black guys.

1719
01:31:01,350 --> 01:31:06,350
Yeah.
You see this video is we see the car be 

1720
01:31:06,350 --> 01:31:11,130
track alone.
Traction control system is very good.

1721
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:13,340
It makes you feel like superman.
It's great.

1722
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:19,470
You feel like you can make you feel like
there's incredible driver.

1723
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:20,610
I believe it,
yeah.

1724
01:31:20,730 --> 01:31:24,990
Now how do you program what we do our 
testing on like an lake in Sweden.

1725
01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:25,990
Oh really?
Yeah.

1726
01:31:26,310 --> 01:31:28,770
Norway and Canada and a few other 
places.

1727
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:32,070
Porsche does a lot of that too as well.
They do a lot of their.

1728
01:31:32,130 --> 01:31:36,630
They do some of their driver training 
school on these frozen surfaces,

1729
01:31:36,990 --> 01:31:38,580
so you're just,
you.

1730
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:40,740
The car is going sideways with you like 
it or not,

1731
01:31:40,741 --> 01:31:45,741
and you have to learn how to slide into 
corners and how do we test it?

1732
01:31:45,910 --> 01:31:50,910
Will electric cars have really great 
traction control because the reaction 

1733
01:31:50,910 --> 01:31:52,320
time is so fast.
So with a gasoline car,

1734
01:31:52,321 --> 01:31:57,321
you've got a lot of latency.
It takes awhile for the and the engine 

1735
01:31:57,321 --> 01:31:59,500
to react and for you.
But for

1736
01:32:00,820 --> 01:32:03,070
electric motors,
incredibly precise.

1737
01:32:04,330 --> 01:32:05,620
That's why like,
like,

1738
01:32:05,740 --> 01:32:09,280
like if you had like a printer or 
something,

1739
01:32:09,660 --> 01:32:11,260
uh,
you would only,

1740
01:32:11,261 --> 01:32:13,030
you wouldn't have a gasoline engine 
printer.

1741
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:15,110
That would be pretty weird.
Um,

1742
01:32:15,150 --> 01:32:16,900
or,
or like a surgical device.

1743
01:32:17,140 --> 01:32:21,220
It's going to be an electric motor on 
the surgical device,

1744
01:32:21,221 --> 01:32:26,221
on the printer.
Gasoline engines going to be just 

1745
01:32:26,221 --> 01:32:30,421
chugging away.
It's not going to have the reaction 

1746
01:32:30,421 --> 01:32:30,421
time,
but to an electric motor,

1747
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:35,320
it's operating at the second level so it
can turn on track,

1748
01:32:35,350 --> 01:32:40,300
on and off traction within inches of 
getting on the honors.

1749
01:32:40,301 --> 01:32:44,500
Like let's say drive a patch of ice.
It'll turn traction off and then turn it

1750
01:32:44,501 --> 01:32:46,390
on a couple of inches right after the 
ice,

1751
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:52,400
like a little patch of ice.
Because in the frame of the electric 

1752
01:32:52,780 --> 01:32:55,990
motor,
you're moving incredibly slowly.

1753
01:32:56,260 --> 01:32:58,000
You're like a snake.
It's your snail.

1754
01:32:58,690 --> 01:33:02,320
You're just moving so slowly because 
it's,

1755
01:33:02,380 --> 01:33:05,110
it's it,
it can see at a thousand frames a second

1756
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:08,440
and say one Mississippi.

1757
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:11,920
It just thought about if things a 
thousand times.

1758
01:33:12,070 --> 01:33:15,040
So it's realized that your wheels are 
not getting traction.

1759
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:18,250
It understand that there's some slippery
surface that you driving on.

1760
01:33:18,330 --> 01:33:21,040
Yes.
And it makes adjustments in real time.

1761
01:33:21,130 --> 01:33:23,260
Yes.
And milliseconds.

1762
01:33:23,860 --> 01:33:28,860
That was,
that'd be so much safer than a regular 

1763
01:33:28,860 --> 01:33:28,860
car.
Yes.

1764
01:33:28,860 --> 01:33:29,660
It is just that alone for loved ones.
You,

1765
01:33:29,661 --> 01:33:34,661
you,
you'd want them to be driving in your 

1766
01:33:34,661 --> 01:33:34,661
car.
Yes.

1767
01:33:34,661 --> 01:33:37,981
The onboard fuck regular motors that the
s x and three art have the lowest 

1768
01:33:42,131 --> 01:33:45,760
probability of injury of any cars ever 
tested by the US government.

1769
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,100
Well,
this is.

1770
01:33:49,990 --> 01:33:51,370
Yeah,
it's pretty fun.

1771
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:52,360
It's pretty crazy.
Like wheat,

1772
01:33:52,750 --> 01:33:54,250
you know,
people still sue us,

1773
01:33:54,340 --> 01:33:59,340
like they'll have like some accident at 
60 miles an hour where they'd like 

1774
01:33:59,340 --> 01:34:03,570
twisted an ankle and they slip.
They like there'll be dead in another 

1775
01:34:03,570 --> 01:34:04,570
car.
They still sue us.

1776
01:34:04,630 --> 01:34:05,650
But that's to be expected.

1777
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:10,800
It is to be expected.
Do you take that into account with like 

1778
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:14,530
the same sort of fatalistic and you 
know,

1779
01:34:14,531 --> 01:34:16,150
undertones to sort of just go,
uh,

1780
01:34:17,300 --> 01:34:20,260
you gotta just let it go.
This is what people do tell you.

1781
01:34:20,261 --> 01:34:22,630
I've got to,
but it is quite a lot of respect for the

1782
01:34:22,631 --> 01:34:25,750
justice system.
Judges are very smart and they see,

1783
01:34:25,790 --> 01:34:29,500
they,
like I've so far I've found judges to be

1784
01:34:29,501 --> 01:34:33,000
very good at justice because I like,
like what?

1785
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:36,010
Like,
and juries are good too.

1786
01:34:36,430 --> 01:34:38,940
Like they're actually quite good,
you know,

1787
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:41,570
people,
you know,

1788
01:34:41,590 --> 01:34:44,650
you read about like occasional errors 
and the justice system,

1789
01:34:44,651 --> 01:34:46,750
let me tell you,
most of the time the very good,

1790
01:34:47,340 --> 01:34:52,340
um,
and the other guy mentioned that who 

1791
01:34:52,340 --> 01:34:55,620
fell asleep in the car and you,
he wrote over a cyclist and you know,

1792
01:34:56,051 --> 01:34:56,740
and,
and,

1793
01:34:56,760 --> 01:34:57,620
and that was what

1794
01:34:58,070 --> 01:35:01,070
encouraged me to get autopilot out as 
soon as possible.

1795
01:35:01,490 --> 01:35:04,550
That guy sued us.
He sued you for Falling Asleep?

1796
01:35:05,150 --> 01:35:05,590
Yes.
He,

1797
01:35:05,690 --> 01:35:06,330
he,
I,

1798
01:35:06,590 --> 01:35:08,990
I'm not gonna he blamed it on the new 
car smell.

1799
01:35:09,550 --> 01:35:09,780
Okay.

1800
01:35:10,470 --> 01:35:11,580
What?
Yes.

1801
01:35:11,790 --> 01:35:16,020
He blamed him falling asleep on your new
car smell.

1802
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:21,440
There's someone who's annoying.
This is a real thing that happened was 

1803
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:21,840
there's a lawyer that thought that 
through in front of his laptop before he

1804
01:35:21,841 --> 01:35:24,090
wrote that up.
Yes.

1805
01:35:24,150 --> 01:35:26,850
He got a lawyer and he sued us and the 
judge was like,

1806
01:35:27,190 --> 01:35:30,090
you're crazy.
Stop bothering me.

1807
01:35:30,870 --> 01:35:32,010
No,
thank God.

1808
01:35:32,100 --> 01:35:33,390
Yes,
thank God.

1809
01:35:33,510 --> 01:35:38,510
Thank God there's a judge out there with
a brain until you dredges are judges a 

1810
01:35:38,510 --> 01:35:38,700
very good.
Some of them.

1811
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:43,760
What about that?
Just a lot of boys up up the river in 

1812
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:44,460
Pennsylvania who was selling those kids 
out.

1813
01:35:44,620 --> 01:35:49,620
You know about that story?
Judge was selling young boys to 

1814
01:35:49,620 --> 01:35:51,060
presence.
He was like literally.

1815
01:35:51,061 --> 01:35:54,320
Yeah.
Literally under bribes for he was.

1816
01:35:54,590 --> 01:35:59,590
Was this an elected judge or.
I'd have a judge that's like actually a 

1817
01:35:59,590 --> 01:36:04,581
politician elected judge.
This is a very famous story who he's in 

1818
01:36:04,581 --> 01:36:06,150
jail right now I think for the rest of 
his life,

1819
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:11,480
and he put away.
He would take like a young boy would do 

1820
01:36:11,480 --> 01:36:14,190
something like steal something from a 
store and he would put them in detention

1821
01:36:14,191 --> 01:36:16,860
for five years,
something ridiculous,

1822
01:36:16,900 --> 01:36:21,900
egregious,
and they investigated this history and 

1823
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:23,400
they found out that he was literally 
being paid off.

1824
01:36:24,240 --> 01:36:27,210
Was it by private prisons?
Is that what the deal was?

1825
01:36:27,750 --> 01:36:29,760
There was some sort of a.
But anyway,

1826
01:36:29,761 --> 01:36:34,761
this judges two judges who judges kids 
for cash scandal is what called the 

1827
01:36:35,910 --> 01:36:37,260
common pleas judges.

1828
01:36:38,270 --> 01:36:40,760
So I think they are elected.
And who was paying them?

1829
01:36:40,950 --> 01:36:41,750
Oh,
um,

1830
01:36:43,650 --> 01:36:46,760
someone.
It was proven to the point where they're

1831
01:36:46,770 --> 01:36:51,770
in jail now that someone was paying them
to put more asses in the seats in these 

1832
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:58,100
private prisons,
million dollar payment to put them in 

1833
01:36:58,100 --> 01:36:58,860
the youth centers builder.
A million dollar payment.

1834
01:36:58,861 --> 01:37:03,861
Yeah.
I do think it's this private prisons 

1835
01:37:03,861 --> 01:37:03,861
thing is creating a bad incentive.
Dark,

1836
01:37:03,861 --> 01:37:04,290
right?
Yes.

1837
01:37:05,430 --> 01:37:09,870
But that judge is in prison.
Thank God.

1838
01:37:09,900 --> 01:37:14,900
Yes.
But for people who think perhaps the 

1839
01:37:14,900 --> 01:37:15,900
justice system consists entirely of 
judges like that.

1840
01:37:15,901 --> 01:37:18,120
I want to assure you this is not the 
case.

1841
01:37:18,570 --> 01:37:20,700
The vast majority of judges have very 
good.

1842
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:25,760
I agree.
And they care about justice and they 

1843
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:27,921
could have made a lot more money if they
wanted to be a trial lawyer and instead 

1844
01:37:27,921 --> 01:37:31,701
they cared about justice and they made 
less money because they care about 

1845
01:37:31,701 --> 01:37:31,701
justice.
And that's why they're judges.

1846
01:37:31,701 --> 01:37:33,210
I feel that same way about police 
officers.

1847
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:38,480
I feel like there's so many interactions
with so many different people with 

1848
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:41,010
police officers that the very few that 
stand out that are horrific,

1849
01:37:41,250 --> 01:37:45,430
we tend to look at that like this is 
evidence that police are all corrupt and

1850
01:37:45,431 --> 01:37:46,530
not.
I think that's crazy.

1851
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:47,760
No,
most,

1852
01:37:47,761 --> 01:37:48,650
most police are,
are,

1853
01:37:48,710 --> 01:37:49,890
are,
are very honest.

1854
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:51,600
Um,
and uh,

1855
01:37:52,330 --> 01:37:52,700
and,
and,

1856
01:37:52,720 --> 01:37:57,720
and,
and like the military or military 

1857
01:37:57,720 --> 01:37:57,720
personnel

1858
01:37:57,720 --> 01:38:00,980
that I know of very honorable ethical 
people and much more honorable ethical 

1859
01:38:00,980 --> 01:38:01,950
than the average person.
That's my impression.

1860
01:38:02,070 --> 01:38:07,070
That's my impression as well.
But that's not to suggest that we be 

1861
01:38:07,070 --> 01:38:08,130
complacent and assume everyone's honest 
and ethical.

1862
01:38:08,820 --> 01:38:11,150
And obviously if somebody is,
is given ape,

1863
01:38:11,490 --> 01:38:16,350
a trusted place in society such as being
a police officer or a judge and they all

1864
01:38:16,351 --> 01:38:21,351
corrupt,
then we must be extra vigilant against 

1865
01:38:21,351 --> 01:38:21,680
such situations and take action.
Uh,

1866
01:38:21,690 --> 01:38:26,690
but,
but we should not think that this is 

1867
01:38:26,690 --> 01:38:26,690
somehow broadly descriptive of people in
that profession.

1868
01:38:26,910 --> 01:38:29,700
I couldn't agree more.
I think there's also an issue with,

1869
01:38:29,701 --> 01:38:34,701
um,
one of the things that happens with 

1870
01:38:34,701 --> 01:38:34,701
police officers,
prosecutors,

1871
01:38:34,701 --> 01:38:39,081
and,
and anyone that's trying to convict 

1872
01:38:39,081 --> 01:38:41,271
someone or arrest someone is that it 
becomes a game and in games people want 

1873
01:38:41,271 --> 01:38:42,270
to win.
Sometimes people cheat.

1874
01:38:42,390 --> 01:38:45,060
Yes,
yes.

1875
01:38:45,061 --> 01:38:46,460
I mean,
if,

1876
01:38:46,820 --> 01:38:48,150
you know,
if your prosecutor shoot,

1877
01:38:48,151 --> 01:38:51,180
you should not always went to when they 
are times when you should,

1878
01:38:51,181 --> 01:38:51,710
like,
okay,

1879
01:38:52,050 --> 01:38:53,550
I just did not want to win this case.

1880
01:38:53,970 --> 01:38:57,030
Um,
and then just pass on that case.

1881
01:38:57,420 --> 01:38:59,280
Sometimes people want to win too much.
That is true.

1882
01:38:59,480 --> 01:39:01,530
Um,
I think also the,

1883
01:39:02,030 --> 01:39:05,460
they call it becomes tough if you're,
if you're like a district Tony,

1884
01:39:06,970 --> 01:39:11,970
you know,
you tend to sort of see a lot of 

1885
01:39:11,970 --> 01:39:14,160
criminals and then your view of the 
world can get negatively,

1886
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:15,660
you know,
have a negative,

1887
01:39:16,740 --> 01:39:21,740
you know,
you have a negative view of the world 

1888
01:39:21,740 --> 01:39:21,740
because,
you know,

1889
01:39:21,740 --> 01:39:22,800
you're just interacting with a lot of 
criminals.

1890
01:39:23,070 --> 01:39:25,800
But actually most of society is not 
consistent criminals.

1891
01:39:26,210 --> 01:39:28,450
Um,
and we had this conversation with Dennis

1892
01:39:28,451 --> 01:39:31,050
several years ago with Tony.
I was like,

1893
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:32,730
man,
I must sometimes seem pretty,

1894
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:35,640
pretty dark because,
you know,

1895
01:39:36,300 --> 01:39:36,870
man,
there's some,

1896
01:39:37,430 --> 01:39:40,530
some terrible human beings out there.
And he was like,

1897
01:39:40,531 --> 01:39:45,531
Yep.
And he was like dealing with some case 

1898
01:39:45,531 --> 01:39:48,770
which consisted of a couple of old 
ladies that would run people over 

1899
01:39:49,561 --> 01:39:50,940
somehow for insurance money.

1900
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:53,640
It was rough.
I was like,

1901
01:39:53,641 --> 01:39:57,430
wow,
that's pretty rough as like,

1902
01:39:57,480 --> 01:40:00,750
it's like hard to maintain faith in 
humanity if you're a district attorney,

1903
01:40:00,751 --> 01:40:02,370
but,
but you know,

1904
01:40:02,371 --> 01:40:07,050
it's only a few percent of society that 
are actually bad.

1905
01:40:07,051 --> 01:40:12,051
And then if you go to the worst say 
point one percent of society or the 

1906
01:40:12,130 --> 01:40:14,520
worst one in a thousand one in a 
million,

1907
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:20,200
you know,
like how bad is the millionth worst 

1908
01:40:20,200 --> 01:40:20,250
person in the United States?
Pretty damn bad.

1909
01:40:20,910 --> 01:40:23,220
Like damn evil.
Like the,

1910
01:40:24,090 --> 01:40:29,090
the million,
like the millionth of one in a million 

1911
01:40:29,090 --> 01:40:30,840
of evil is so evil.
He will,

1912
01:40:30,841 --> 01:40:35,841
could not even conceive of it.
But there's 330 million people in the 

1913
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:41,240
United States.
So that's 330 people out there 

1914
01:40:41,240 --> 01:40:41,790
somewhere.
But by the same token,

1915
01:40:41,820 --> 01:40:46,820
there's also 330 people are incredible 
angels and unbelievably good human 

1916
01:40:47,341 --> 01:40:48,900
beings.
Yeah,

1917
01:40:49,350 --> 01:40:52,590
on the other side.
But because of our fear of danger,

1918
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:53,830
we tend to.

1919
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:59,280
Our thoughts tend to gravitate towards 
the worst case scenario and we want to 

1920
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:00,760
frame that and that is one of the real 
problems with prejudice.

1921
01:41:01,260 --> 01:41:06,260
We want,
whether it's prejudice towards a 

1922
01:41:06,260 --> 01:41:07,960
different minorities or prejudice 
towards police officers or anything.

1923
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:13,320
So we want to look at the worst case 
scenario and say this is an example of 

1924
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:15,310
what this is all about.
And you see that even with people,

1925
01:41:15,311 --> 01:41:18,940
how they frame genders and some some men
from women like that,

1926
01:41:18,941 --> 01:41:22,060
they get ripped off by a few women and 
they said all women are evil.

1927
01:41:22,150 --> 01:41:24,610
Some women get fucked over by a few men.
All men are shit.

1928
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:28,660
And in this this is very toxic and it's 
also,

1929
01:41:29,140 --> 01:41:34,140
it's a very unbalanced way of viewing 
the world and it's very emotionally 

1930
01:41:34,331 --> 01:41:36,580
based and it's based on your own 
experience,

1931
01:41:36,581 --> 01:41:39,820
your own anecdotal experience.
And it can.

1932
01:41:39,821 --> 01:41:42,370
It can be very influential to the people
around you.

1933
01:41:42,430 --> 01:41:45,010
And it's just.
It's a dangerous way.

1934
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:47,740
It's a dangerous thought process and 
pattern to promote.

1935
01:41:47,900 --> 01:41:50,120
It is.
It is a very dangerous pattern.

1936
01:41:50,300 --> 01:41:55,300
I really think people should give other 
people the benefit of the doubt and 

1937
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,580
assume that they're good until proven 
otherwise,

1938
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:02,420
and I think really most people are 
actually pretty good people.

1939
01:42:03,380 --> 01:42:05,300
Nobody's perfect.
You have to be.

1940
01:42:05,450 --> 01:42:10,450
If you think of vast numbers of us,
they're just interacting with each 

1941
01:42:10,450 --> 01:42:10,450
other,
with each other constantly.

1942
01:42:10,580 --> 01:42:12,620
We have to be better than we think we 
are.

1943
01:42:13,790 --> 01:42:15,650
There's no other way right here.
All these weapons.

1944
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:18,080
But how many times,
like nobody's presumably tried to murder

1945
01:42:18,081 --> 01:42:19,200
you in your industry.
Yes.

1946
01:42:19,210 --> 01:42:23,690
Nobody is like fake flame thrower here.
Not a flame thrower.

1947
01:42:23,990 --> 01:42:26,000
Now we've got a real problem.
I'm going to put it on that side too.

1948
01:42:26,001 --> 01:42:28,190
I'm going to leave it for the guests.
Yeah.

1949
01:42:28,700 --> 01:42:29,390
I'm like,
look man,

1950
01:42:29,391 --> 01:42:31,550
if I say something that fucked up,
it's right there.

1951
01:42:31,850 --> 01:42:36,650
So to liven things up for sure.
Guaranteed to make any party better.

1952
01:42:36,740 --> 01:42:38,130
Yeah.
Well that's.

1953
01:42:38,180 --> 01:42:41,840
I mean that's the armed a civilization 
theory,

1954
01:42:41,870 --> 01:42:46,870
right?
That an armed community is a safe and 

1955
01:42:46,870 --> 01:42:47,300
polite community

1956
01:42:48,460 --> 01:42:50,780
in Texas.
It's kind of true.

1957
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:52,610
Yeah.
I mean,

1958
01:42:53,240 --> 01:42:58,240
people in Texas are super polite and 
everybody don't make somebody angry.

1959
01:43:00,780 --> 01:43:02,080
Don't know what's going to happen.
Yeah.

1960
01:43:02,081 --> 01:43:03,380
It's not a good mood.
Yeah.

1961
01:43:03,470 --> 01:43:05,360
Piss people off when everybody can have 
a gun.

1962
01:43:06,330 --> 01:43:08,990
Just let that guy get in your lane.
Yeah.

1963
01:43:09,860 --> 01:43:11,360
Yeah.
We've got a big,

1964
01:43:11,630 --> 01:43:16,630
a test site in central Texas near Waco.
Beautiful space x,

1965
01:43:16,851 --> 01:43:21,851
uh,
in Mcgregor just about 15 minutes away 

1966
01:43:21,851 --> 01:43:22,040
from Waco.
It's close to where Ted nugent lives.

1967
01:43:22,460 --> 01:43:24,410
It has to Ted nugent.
Okay,

1968
01:43:24,411 --> 01:43:26,120
cool.
Yeah,

1969
01:43:26,790 --> 01:43:28,280
there are,
you know,

1970
01:43:28,281 --> 01:43:33,281
we have lots of fire,
loud explosions and things and people 

1971
01:43:33,281 --> 01:43:33,281
like that.
They're cool with it.

1972
01:43:33,281 --> 01:43:34,790
They don't give a fuck out there.
They're very supportive.

1973
01:43:35,510 --> 01:43:38,090
You can buy fireworks where your kids go
to school.

1974
01:43:38,180 --> 01:43:39,020
Yeah.
It's,

1975
01:43:39,860 --> 01:43:41,120
you know,
it's dangerous.

1976
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:43,160
Yeah.
But it's free.

1977
01:43:43,310 --> 01:43:48,310
It's free.
This is something that's very enticing 

1978
01:43:48,310 --> 01:43:48,380
because of that.
It is dangerous,

1979
01:43:48,710 --> 01:43:50,120
but it's also free,
right?

1980
01:43:50,330 --> 01:43:51,350
Yeah.
Yeah.

1981
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:53,750
I kinda like Texas.
Well,

1982
01:43:53,751 --> 01:43:58,751
I prefer it over places that are more 
restrictive but more liberal because you

1983
01:43:59,871 --> 01:44:03,920
could always be liberal like just 
because things are free and just because

1984
01:44:03,921 --> 01:44:05,330
you have a certain amount of,
you know,

1985
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:08,750
right wing type characters,
it doesn't mean you have to be that way,

1986
01:44:09,080 --> 01:44:14,080
you know,
and honestly there's a lot of those 

1987
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:16,121
people that are pretty fucking open 
minded and let you do whatever you want 

1988
01:44:16,121 --> 01:44:17,780
to do and you don't bother them.
Yeah,

1989
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:23,080
exactly.
That's my hope right now with the way 

1990
01:44:23,080 --> 01:44:27,311
we're able to communicate with each 
other today and how radically different 

1991
01:44:27,311 --> 01:44:28,460
it is than generations past is that we 
all just.

1992
01:44:28,610 --> 01:44:30,870
The dust settles and we all realized 
like,

1993
01:44:31,150 --> 01:44:34,220
like what you were saying,
that most people are good.

1994
01:44:34,340 --> 01:44:36,380
Most people are good.
The vast majority.

1995
01:44:36,440 --> 01:44:41,440
Yes.
I think you should give people the 

1996
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:41,440
benefit of the doubt for sure.
I think you're right.

1997
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:41,440
Yeah.
You know what can help that?

1998
01:44:42,060 --> 01:44:45,130
What mushrooms do.
Anything.

1999
01:44:45,980 --> 01:44:47,600
They're delicious.
Yeah.

2000
01:44:47,601 --> 01:44:49,430
Right there.
Good for you.

2001
01:44:49,450 --> 01:44:53,090
To all of them,
all kinds of.

2002
01:44:55,820 --> 01:45:00,820
What do you see in terms of when you 
think about the future of your 

2003
01:45:00,820 --> 01:45:02,540
companies,
what do you see as like bottlenecks?

2004
01:45:02,590 --> 01:45:04,130
He wants more of this.
Sure.

2005
01:45:04,340 --> 01:45:09,340
Thank you.
What do you see in terms of like 

2006
01:45:09,340 --> 01:45:11,450
bottlenecks of things that are,
that are holding back innovation?

2007
01:45:11,750 --> 01:45:16,750
Is it regulatory commissions and people 
that don't understand the technology 

2008
01:45:16,821 --> 01:45:20,370
that are influencing policy?
Like what?

2009
01:45:20,380 --> 01:45:25,380
What?
What could potentially be holding you 

2010
01:45:25,380 --> 01:45:25,380
guys back?
Right.

2011
01:45:25,380 --> 01:45:25,380
No.

2012
01:45:27,470 --> 01:45:29,370
Is there anything that you would change?
Yeah,

2013
01:45:29,960 --> 01:45:30,740
that's a good question.

2014
01:45:34,990 --> 01:45:35,740
You know,
I wish.

2015
01:45:36,640 --> 01:45:38,590
I wish politicians were better at 
science.

2016
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:41,140
That would help a lot.
That's a problem.

2017
01:45:42,460 --> 01:45:44,680
Yes.
There's no incentive for them to be good

2018
01:45:44,681 --> 01:45:46,270
at science.
There isn't.

2019
01:45:47,290 --> 01:45:48,330
I'm actually,
you know,

2020
01:45:48,331 --> 01:45:49,990
they're,
they're pretty good at science in China,

2021
01:45:50,110 --> 01:45:52,810
I have to say.
Yeah.

2022
01:45:52,811 --> 01:45:57,811
The mayor of Beijing is,
I believe in environmental engineering 

2023
01:45:57,811 --> 01:45:58,510
degree and the deputy mayor as a physics
degree.

2024
01:45:58,660 --> 01:46:03,660
I met them and the mayor say,
Shanghai has really smart and you're up 

2025
01:46:04,470 --> 01:46:09,470
on technology.
What do you think about this government 

2026
01:46:09,470 --> 01:46:11,760
policy of,
of stopping use of walway phones and 

2027
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:12,750
there's something about the,
the,

2028
01:46:12,751 --> 01:46:16,250
the,
the worry about spying is,

2029
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:19,180
I mean,
from what I've understand from real tech

2030
01:46:19,181 --> 01:46:20,770
people,
they think it's horseshit.

2031
01:46:23,250 --> 01:46:25,140
Oh,
I don't know.

2032
01:46:25,400 --> 01:46:28,050
I don't know.
I'm like the government said don't you,

2033
01:46:28,051 --> 01:46:31,450
by Huawei phones.
Is that do,

2034
01:46:31,930 --> 01:46:34,620
are you up on that are all now,
should we just spend in this idea?

2035
01:46:35,240 --> 01:46:37,650
And I think like I guess if you're,
if you're,

2036
01:46:37,651 --> 01:46:40,590
uh,
if you have like top secret stuff,

2037
01:46:40,650 --> 01:46:43,200
um,
then you want to be pretty careful about

2038
01:46:43,201 --> 01:46:45,260
what hardware you use.
Uh,

2039
01:46:45,300 --> 01:46:50,300
but you know,
like most people do not have top secret 

2040
01:46:50,300 --> 01:46:50,610
stuff and like nobody cares what porn 
you watch,

2041
01:46:50,970 --> 01:46:55,380
you know,
it's like nobody actually cares,

2042
01:46:55,650 --> 01:46:57,300
you know?
So if they do,

2043
01:46:57,720 --> 01:47:02,280
that's kind of on them.
Like national spy agencies do not,

2044
01:47:02,910 --> 01:47:07,260
do not give a rat's ass watch porn.
You Watch,

2045
01:47:07,261 --> 01:47:12,261
they do not to care.
So like what secrets does a national spy

2046
01:47:12,901 --> 01:47:14,820
agency have to learn from the average 
citizen?

2047
01:47:14,821 --> 01:47:15,990
Probably nothing.
Well,

2048
01:47:15,991 --> 01:47:18,980
that's the argument against the,
the,

2049
01:47:19,070 --> 01:47:24,070
the narrative in the argument by a lot 
of these tech people is that the real 

2050
01:47:24,070 --> 01:47:28,041
concern is that these companies like 
Huawei are innovating at a radical pace 

2051
01:47:28,041 --> 01:47:30,990
and they're trying to stop them from 
integrating into our culture and letting

2052
01:47:30,991 --> 01:47:31,260
this.

2053
01:47:31,740 --> 01:47:32,400
Right.
Right now,

2054
01:47:32,401 --> 01:47:35,310
they're the number two cell phone 
manufacturer in the world.

2055
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:40,360
Okay.
Samsung's number one hallway is number 

2056
01:47:40,360 --> 01:47:40,360
two apples.
Now,

2057
01:47:40,360 --> 01:47:41,070
number three,
they surpassed apple is number two.

2058
01:47:41,430 --> 01:47:46,430
And the idea is that this is all taking 
place without them having any foothold 

2059
01:47:46,430 --> 01:47:47,520
whatsoever.
In America there are no,

2060
01:47:47,700 --> 01:47:50,430
there's no carriers that have their 
phones.

2061
01:47:50,670 --> 01:47:55,670
You have to buy their phones unlocked 
through some sort of a third party and 

2062
01:47:55,670 --> 01:47:55,700
then put.
Okay.

2063
01:47:56,100 --> 01:48:01,100
So the worry is that these are somehow 
or another controlled by the Chinese 

2064
01:48:02,041 --> 01:48:07,041
government.
The communist Chinese government is 

2065
01:48:07,041 --> 01:48:08,280
going to distribute these phones and I 
don't know if it's the worries,

2066
01:48:08,670 --> 01:48:11,760
economic influence that they'll have too
much power.

2067
01:48:11,761 --> 01:48:13,260
I don't know what it is.
Are you,

2068
01:48:13,410 --> 01:48:15,870
are you paying attention on any of this?
Not really,

2069
01:48:15,871 --> 01:48:20,871
no.
I don't think we worry too much about 

2070
01:48:20,871 --> 01:48:20,871
Huawei phones.
Uh,

2071
01:48:20,871 --> 01:48:21,340
you know,
maybe you know,

2072
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:23,370
our national security agencies shouldn't
have how?

2073
01:48:23,370 --> 01:48:25,860
Well,
maybe that's a question mark,

2074
01:48:27,120 --> 01:48:32,120
but I think for the average citizen,
doesn't matter just like.

2075
01:48:32,581 --> 01:48:37,581
No,
I'm pretty sure the Chinese government 

2076
01:48:37,581 --> 01:48:40,251
does not care about the goings on of the
average American citizen is.

2077
01:48:42,020 --> 01:48:47,020
Is there a time where you think that 
there will be no security will be 

2078
01:48:48,391 --> 01:48:51,830
impossible to hold back information that
whatever bottleneck will,

2079
01:48:51,831 --> 01:48:53,460
will let go.
We're gonna,

2080
01:48:53,850 --> 01:48:58,850
we're gonna give in that whatever 
bottleneck between privacy and ultimate 

2081
01:48:58,850 --> 01:49:03,471
innovation will,
will have to be bridged in order for us 

2082
01:49:03,471 --> 01:49:05,010
to achieve the next level of 
technological proficiency.

2083
01:49:05,011 --> 01:49:07,230
That we're just going to abandon it and 
there'll be no,

2084
01:49:07,320 --> 01:49:09,180
no security,
no privacy.

2085
01:49:09,960 --> 01:49:13,140
Do people want privacy because they seem
to put everything on the Internet?

2086
01:49:13,590 --> 01:49:15,240
Well,
right now they're confused,

2087
01:49:15,241 --> 01:49:17,120
but when you're talking about your neuro
link and this,

2088
01:49:17,121 --> 01:49:22,121
this idea that one day we're going to be
able to share information and we're 

2089
01:49:22,121 --> 01:49:25,731
going to be some sort of a thing that 
symbiotically create a symbiotic and 

2090
01:49:26,040 --> 01:49:31,040
connected.
I think we really need to worry about 

2091
01:49:31,040 --> 01:49:31,040
security and that situation and one.
Sure.

2092
01:49:31,040 --> 01:49:32,640
That's like a security repair amount.
Sure,

2093
01:49:33,060 --> 01:49:36,810
but also we will,
we will be is will be so much different.

2094
01:49:36,811 --> 01:49:39,270
Lark,
our concerns about money,

2095
01:49:39,570 --> 01:49:44,570
about status,
about where all these things will will 

2096
01:49:44,570 --> 01:49:45,360
seemingly go by the wayside if we really
become enlightened,

2097
01:49:45,750 --> 01:49:50,750
if we really become artificially 
enlightened by some sort of an ai 

2098
01:49:50,750 --> 01:49:55,170
interface where we have this symbiotic 
relationship with some new Internet type

2099
01:49:58,030 --> 01:49:59,710
connection to inflammation.

2100
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:03,000
What?
What happens then?

2101
01:50:04,700 --> 01:50:05,120
What?

2102
01:50:06,330 --> 01:50:08,220
What is important?
What is not important?

2103
01:50:08,221 --> 01:50:10,650
Is Privacy important when we're all 
gods?

2104
01:50:13,540 --> 01:50:16,900
I mean I think the things that we think 
are important,

2105
01:50:16,901 --> 01:50:19,980
key private right now we probably will 
not think are important.

2106
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:23,050
Right.
Information,

2107
01:50:23,860 --> 01:50:26,370
right?
What do you,

2108
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:28,130
what do you hide?
Emotions.

2109
01:50:28,170 --> 01:50:29,880
What do we hide?
I mean,

2110
01:50:29,910 --> 01:50:31,020
I think like,
I don't know,

2111
01:50:31,021 --> 01:50:34,200
maybe it's like embarrassing,
so embarrassing stuff,

2112
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:35,610
but

2113
01:50:36,440 --> 01:50:41,440
there's actually like I think people,
there's not that much that's kept 

2114
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:43,640
private.
The people that is actually relevant,

2115
01:50:43,740 --> 01:50:48,740
right?
That's people what other people would 

2116
01:50:48,740 --> 01:50:48,740
actually care about and we think other 
people care about it,

2117
01:50:48,740 --> 01:50:49,300
but they don't really care about her 
sense.

2118
01:50:49,301 --> 01:50:50,290
Certainly governments don't.

2119
01:50:50,730 --> 01:50:51,010
Yeah,

2120
01:50:51,160 --> 01:50:53,680
well some people care about it,
but then it gets weird when you,

2121
01:50:53,710 --> 01:50:56,260
when it gets exposed,
like Jennifer Lawrence when I was naked,

2122
01:50:56,261 --> 01:51:01,261
pictures of her God exposed like I think
in some ways people liked her more than 

2123
01:51:01,261 --> 01:51:01,330
they realize like,
oh,

2124
01:51:01,331 --> 01:51:05,950
she's just a person that just a girl who
likes sacs and it's just alive and has a

2125
01:51:05,951 --> 01:51:09,850
boyfriend and send them messages and now
you get to look into it and you probably

2126
01:51:09,851 --> 01:51:13,720
shouldn't have somebody let it go and 
they put it online and the all right.

2127
01:51:16,740 --> 01:51:17,810
She seems to be done.
Okay.

2128
01:51:18,090 --> 01:51:23,090
Person.
She's just you and me and the same 

2129
01:51:23,090 --> 01:51:25,821
thing.
She just send some weird place where 

2130
01:51:25,821 --> 01:51:27,390
she's on a 35 foot tall screen with 
music playing every time she talks.

2131
01:51:30,130 --> 01:51:30,710
Yeah,
I,

2132
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:32,920
I,
I'm sure she's,

2133
01:51:32,921 --> 01:51:33,800
she's not,
uh,

2134
01:51:34,310 --> 01:51:35,950
not happy about it but she,
she's.

2135
01:51:36,010 --> 01:51:37,960
But she's clearly doing fine.

2136
01:51:38,090 --> 01:51:43,090
But once this interface is fully 
realized where we really do become 

2137
01:51:44,241 --> 01:51:49,241
something far more powerful in terms of 
our cognitive ability,

2138
01:51:49,370 --> 01:51:54,370
our ability to understand irrational 
thoughts and mitigate them and that 

2139
01:51:54,370 --> 01:51:57,260
we're all connected and some sort of an 
insane way.

2140
01:51:57,261 --> 01:51:57,760
What I mean,
how,

2141
01:51:57,761 --> 01:51:58,050
what,
uh,

2142
01:51:58,060 --> 01:52:01,640
what are thoughts on wealth,
our thoughts on social status,

2143
01:52:01,641 --> 01:52:05,480
like how many of those just evaporate 
and our need for privacy.

2144
01:52:06,050 --> 01:52:11,050
Maybe our need for privacy will be the 
ultimate bottleneck that we'll have to 

2145
01:52:11,050 --> 01:52:11,050
subsidize that we'll have to surpass.

2146
01:52:13,930 --> 01:52:14,320
I think

2147
01:52:15,330 --> 01:52:20,330
the things that we think are important.
No will probably not to be important in 

2148
01:52:20,330 --> 01:52:24,321
the future,
but there will be things that are 

2149
01:52:24,321 --> 01:52:25,610
important for things.
I don't know.

2150
01:52:25,620 --> 01:52:28,230
They might be some war of ideas 
potentially.

2151
01:52:29,620 --> 01:52:31,120
I don't think Darwin's going away.

2152
01:52:32,110 --> 01:52:32,470
Right?

2153
01:52:33,380 --> 01:52:38,380
No one's going to be there.
That was on will be there forever.

2154
01:52:39,690 --> 01:52:41,010
Forever.
Yeah.

2155
01:52:41,240 --> 01:52:43,620
It would just be a difference in a 
different arena.

2156
01:52:45,270 --> 01:52:46,030
Different.
The

2157
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:48,470
digital arena,
different arena.

2158
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:54,220
Dawn is not going away.
What keeps you up at night?

2159
01:52:57,740 --> 01:52:59,300
Well,
it's quite hard to run companies.

2160
01:52:59,360 --> 01:53:02,090
Yeah.
Especially car companies.

2161
01:53:02,180 --> 01:53:03,590
How did they.
It's quite challenging.

2162
01:53:03,770 --> 01:53:08,770
The car businesses,
the hardest one of all the things you 

2163
01:53:08,770 --> 01:53:08,770
do.
Yes,

2164
01:53:08,770 --> 01:53:12,790
because it's a consumer oriented 
business as opposed to like space x and 

2165
01:53:12,860 --> 01:53:16,310
not that space x space X.
There's no walk in the park but,

2166
01:53:17,510 --> 01:53:22,510
but a car company,
it's very difficult to keep a company 

2167
01:53:22,510 --> 01:53:22,940
alive.
It's very difficult.

2168
01:53:23,870 --> 01:53:28,870
You know,
there's only two car companies and the 

2169
01:53:28,870 --> 01:53:29,510
history of American car companies that 
haven't gone bankrupt.

2170
01:53:29,511 --> 01:53:32,840
And that's Ford and Tesla.
That's it.

2171
01:53:33,590 --> 01:53:35,750
Yeah.
Ford wrote out that crazy storm.

2172
01:53:35,751 --> 01:53:36,920
Huh?
They're the only ones.

2173
01:53:36,930 --> 01:53:39,080
The skin of their teeth shout out to the
Mustang.

2174
01:53:41,350 --> 01:53:42,440
Yeah.
By the skin of their teeth.

2175
01:53:42,710 --> 01:53:43,600
That is interesting.
Right?

2176
01:53:43,610 --> 01:53:45,590
Same with Tesla.
We barely survived.

2177
01:53:45,830 --> 01:53:49,880
How close did you get to folding?
Very close.

2178
01:53:49,940 --> 01:53:54,920
We a 2008 is not a good time to be a car
company,

2179
01:53:54,921 --> 01:53:58,340
especially a startup company and 
especially in electric car company.

2180
01:53:58,850 --> 01:54:03,850
I was like stupidity squared and this is
when you had those cool roadsters with 

2181
01:54:03,850 --> 01:54:05,510
the t top with the.
I'm a target top.

2182
01:54:06,380 --> 01:54:07,790
Yeah.
We had like a,

2183
01:54:08,710 --> 01:54:12,350
he was a highly modified elise chassis.
The body was all completely different,

2184
01:54:13,140 --> 01:54:16,980
but that was super dumb strategy that we
actually did was dumb.

2185
01:54:18,260 --> 01:54:23,260
It was based on false premises.
One false premise was that we'd be able 

2186
01:54:23,260 --> 01:54:24,440
to,
uh,

2187
01:54:24,500 --> 01:54:29,500
cheaply convert the Lotus Elise and use 
that as a core platform and that we will

2188
01:54:31,851 --> 01:54:36,851
be able to use technology from this 
little company called ace propulsion for

2189
01:54:37,281 --> 01:54:42,281
the electric drive train.
And the battery problem is they 

2190
01:54:43,100 --> 01:54:48,100
propulsion technology to not work in 
production and we ended up using none of

2191
01:54:48,201 --> 01:54:48,920
it in long term.

2192
01:54:49,100 --> 01:54:50,930
None of it.
We have to redesign everything.

2193
01:54:51,860 --> 01:54:55,460
And then the,
once you add a battery pack and electric

2194
01:54:55,461 --> 01:54:57,480
motor to the cart,
got a heavier cut,

2195
01:54:57,500 --> 01:55:00,680
30 percent heavier,
invalidated the entire structure,

2196
01:55:00,681 --> 01:55:02,890
all the crash structure,
everything had to be redone,

2197
01:55:04,460 --> 01:55:09,460
nothing like that.
I think it had less than seven percent 

2198
01:55:09,460 --> 01:55:13,481
of the parts were common with any other 
device including cars or anything else?

2199
01:55:13,631 --> 01:55:17,330
The seven percent yes.
Everything including tires and wheels,

2200
01:55:17,480 --> 01:55:22,480
bolts breaks even every year.
And we'll see the steering wheel was.

2201
01:55:24,470 --> 01:55:27,260
I think the steering wheel was almost 
the same.

2202
01:55:28,550 --> 01:55:31,600
Yes.
The windscreen went Wednesday.

2203
01:55:31,880 --> 01:55:33,260
No,
I think the windscreen is the same.

2204
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:34,070
Yes,
I think.

2205
01:55:34,190 --> 01:55:36,260
I think we were able to keep the last 
seven percent.

2206
01:55:36,261 --> 01:55:38,840
So that's basically every body panel was
different.

2207
01:55:38,870 --> 01:55:43,530
The entire structure was different.
The way we couldn't use the H,

2208
01:55:43,620 --> 01:55:43,980
like the

2209
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:47,160
HVAC system,
the view of the air conditioner was belt

2210
01:55:47,161 --> 01:55:48,540
driven,
air conditioner off.

2211
01:55:49,230 --> 01:55:54,230
So now we needed a something that was 
electrically driven which needed a new 

2212
01:55:54,230 --> 01:55:57,510
AC compressor and all that takes away 
from the battery life as well.

2213
01:55:57,511 --> 01:55:58,260
Right?
Yeah.

2214
01:55:58,290 --> 01:56:02,130
We needed an small,
highly efficient air conditioning system

2215
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:06,220
that fit in a tiny car and was 
electrically powered belt driven.

2216
01:56:06,850 --> 01:56:10,830
It's very difficult.
How much do those weigh those cars?

2217
01:56:11,790 --> 01:56:14,190
The roadster,
I think it was about 2,700

2218
01:56:14,191 --> 01:56:19,191
pounds.
That's still very depending on which 

2219
01:56:19,191 --> 01:56:19,191
version?
Twenty six,

2220
01:56:19,191 --> 01:56:19,191
52,
27,

2221
01:56:19,191 --> 01:56:19,191
50 pounds,
something like that.

2222
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:21,150
And what was the weight distribution?

2223
01:56:23,280 --> 01:56:27,690
It was about 50.
Well they were different versions of the

2224
01:56:27,691 --> 01:56:32,691
car.
So it's about 55 on the rear because 

2225
01:56:32,691 --> 01:56:33,540
we're bias.
Right.

2226
01:56:33,541 --> 01:56:36,300
But not bad considering like a nine 
slash 11,

2227
01:56:36,301 --> 01:56:39,360
which is like one of the most popular 
sports cards of all time heavy.

2228
01:56:39,480 --> 01:56:41,310
We're in bias.
Well,

2229
01:56:41,850 --> 01:56:44,790
I mean yeah,
the nine slash 11.

2230
01:56:45,040 --> 01:56:50,040
Like the joke is like the bench dirt,
despite Newton not being on their side.

2231
01:56:51,140 --> 01:56:52,800
If you have fighting Newton,
it's very difficult.

2232
01:56:53,250 --> 01:56:54,890
Well,
it's like if you've got this,

2233
01:56:55,150 --> 01:56:58,650
the moments of inertia on nine slash 11 
don't make any sense.

2234
01:56:59,010 --> 01:57:00,780
They do.
Once you understand them,

2235
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:06,560
once you understood,
don't want to hang the engine off the 

2236
01:57:06,560 --> 01:57:06,560
ass.
This is not a wise move.

2237
01:57:06,560 --> 01:57:08,460
You don't want to let up on the gas.
When you're in a corner,

2238
01:57:08,740 --> 01:57:10,430
you,
the problem with,

2239
01:57:10,431 --> 01:57:10,680
uh,
with,

2240
01:57:10,681 --> 01:57:11,090
with,
uh,

2241
01:57:11,640 --> 01:57:12,360
with,
with something,

2242
01:57:12,361 --> 01:57:15,720
that's where the engine is mounted over 
the rear axle or off the rear axle,

2243
01:57:15,721 --> 01:57:20,721
towards the rear is that you pull them 
moment of inertia is fundamentally 

2244
01:57:20,721 --> 01:57:20,721
screwed.

2245
01:57:20,721 --> 01:57:21,750
You cannot solve this.
It's unsolvable.

2246
01:57:22,540 --> 01:57:24,240
You're screwed.
Pull them over to know Sherry.

2247
01:57:24,600 --> 01:57:26,880
You're screwed,
right?

2248
01:57:27,240 --> 01:57:27,910
Like,
seriously.

2249
01:57:27,911 --> 01:57:32,911
If you spun the car like a top,
that that's your polar moment of 

2250
01:57:32,911 --> 01:57:33,870
inertia.
You're just,

2251
01:57:35,590 --> 01:57:40,590
I promised,
I wouldn't swear to this show by the 

2252
01:57:40,590 --> 01:57:40,590
way,
really to who it was a friend.

2253
01:57:40,590 --> 01:57:43,020
Tell that friend to go fuck himself.
Who told you not to swear.

2254
01:57:43,720 --> 01:57:48,720
Read a good friend.
You realize you're fucking Elan Musk can

2255
01:57:49,591 --> 01:57:50,520
do whatever you want,
man.

2256
01:57:51,510 --> 01:57:54,840
If you ever get confused,
call me elsewhere and private.

2257
01:57:55,680 --> 01:57:59,130
Swear up a storm.
Just say fricking fun way.

2258
01:57:59,131 --> 01:58:04,131
There's like old house moms that have 
children.

2259
01:58:07,070 --> 01:58:08,760
That's fricking thing.
Yeah.

2260
01:58:09,390 --> 01:58:10,500
But anyway,
like the Porsche,

2261
01:58:10,501 --> 01:58:14,850
it's kind of incredible how well Porsche
handles given that it's the physics,

2262
01:58:15,250 --> 01:58:17,760
the moments of inertia.
So messed up,

2263
01:58:18,560 --> 01:58:20,670
uh,
to actually still make it work well is,

2264
01:58:20,690 --> 01:58:21,690
is incredible.
Well,

2265
01:58:21,691 --> 01:58:26,691
if you know how to turn into the corner 
and once you get used to the feeling of 

2266
01:58:26,691 --> 01:58:26,691
it,
there's actual benefits to it.

2267
01:58:26,910 --> 01:58:27,280
You know,
there,

2268
01:58:27,281 --> 01:58:31,470
there are some benefits.
I enjoy the car I had before.

2269
01:58:31,860 --> 01:58:33,570
Tesla was a nine slash seven.
Oh,

2270
01:58:34,460 --> 01:58:35,190
nine,
nine,

2271
01:58:35,191 --> 01:58:37,900
seven or six or seven.
Yeah.

2272
01:58:38,070 --> 01:58:40,920
Yeah.
I'm great car man.

2273
01:58:41,530 --> 01:58:46,530
Yeah.
I mean particularly with other Porsche 

2274
01:58:46,530 --> 01:58:48,040
stutter when they had the variable veins
a turbo and yet don't have the turbo 

2275
01:58:48,040 --> 01:58:48,040
lag.
That was great.

2276
01:58:48,040 --> 01:58:48,910
Yeah,
that was really great.

2277
01:58:49,060 --> 01:58:51,040
The turbo lag was like,
you know,

2278
01:58:51,120 --> 01:58:53,920
your floor it,
like photo home,

2279
01:58:53,980 --> 01:58:58,150
call your mom the older one,
but an hour later the car accelerates.

2280
01:58:58,780 --> 01:59:02,140
Super dangerous too because in the real 
world starts spinning.

2281
01:59:02,141 --> 01:59:03,040
Yeah.
Yeah.

2282
01:59:03,340 --> 01:59:08,340
There's something fun about it though,
like feeling that rear weight kicking 

2283
01:59:08,340 --> 01:59:08,430
around,
you know,

2284
01:59:08,440 --> 01:59:10,810
and again I could feel to it.
Yeah.

2285
01:59:10,850 --> 01:59:11,560
Yeah,
I agree.

2286
01:59:11,800 --> 01:59:14,350
But that's what I was talking about 
earlier about that

2287
01:59:14,580 --> 01:59:17,060
card that I have 93,
nine slash 11.

2288
01:59:17,061 --> 01:59:19,700
It's just there's not fast.
It's not,

2289
01:59:19,790 --> 01:59:24,790
it's not the best handling car but it's 
more satisfying than any other car I 

2290
01:59:24,790 --> 01:59:28,200
have because it's so mechanical.
It's like everything about it like crack

2291
01:59:28,201 --> 01:59:33,201
holes and bumps and it gives you all 
this feedback and I take it to the 

2292
01:59:33,201 --> 01:59:37,511
comedy store because when I get there I 
feel like my brain is just pop in and 

2293
01:59:37,511 --> 01:59:41,771
it's on fire.
It's like a strategy for me now that I 

2294
01:59:41,771 --> 01:59:45,370
really stopped driving other cars there.
I drive that car there just for the 

2295
01:59:45,370 --> 01:59:47,670
brain juice.
Just for the owner.

2296
01:59:47,870 --> 01:59:48,830
The interaction.

2297
01:59:50,090 --> 01:59:55,090
I mean you should try model s p 100 d 
will blow your mind your skull.

2298
01:59:55,490 --> 01:59:56,380
Okay.
Yeah.

2299
01:59:56,810 --> 01:59:59,200
Tell me what to order.
I'll order one LSP,

2300
01:59:59,290 --> 02:00:00,470
100 d.
okay.

2301
02:00:00,530 --> 02:00:02,540
Jamie,
that's the Tesla car that I drive.

2302
02:00:02,570 --> 02:00:03,320
Okay.
Okay,

2303
02:00:03,321 --> 02:00:05,480
I'll get with the car you drive.
Okay.

2304
02:00:05,780 --> 02:00:07,380
It will blow your mind out of your 
spirit.

2305
02:00:07,490 --> 02:00:11,150
I believe you.
How can I drive 300 miles?

2306
02:00:11,420 --> 02:00:14,420
That's good for la.
Regular days.

2307
02:00:14,520 --> 02:00:16,520
You'll never notice the battery.
Never,

2308
02:00:16,550 --> 02:00:21,550
never.
How hard is it to get like one of them 

2309
02:00:21,550 --> 02:00:22,340
crazy plugs installed in your house?
That difficult?

2310
02:00:22,460 --> 02:00:24,320
Now it's super easy.
It's like,

2311
02:00:24,420 --> 02:00:25,760
yeah,
it's like a dryer plug.

2312
02:00:25,800 --> 02:00:29,150
It's like a dryer outlet.
Didn't you come up with some crazy tiles

2313
02:00:29,151 --> 02:00:31,670
for your roof that are solar paneled?
Yeah,

2314
02:00:31,700 --> 02:00:33,230
yeah,
we're have it on my roof right now.

2315
02:00:33,231 --> 02:00:34,730
Actually,
I'm just trying it out.

2316
02:00:34,760 --> 02:00:36,950
But it's like,
it's the thing is it takes while to like

2317
02:00:36,951 --> 02:00:39,680
test roof stuff because roofs have to 
last a long time.

2318
02:00:39,930 --> 02:00:44,930
So like your watch your roof to last 
like 30 years for a regular groove now.

2319
02:00:45,410 --> 02:00:48,050
So there's two versions.
There's like the solar panels you put on

2320
02:00:48,051 --> 02:00:53,051
a roof.
So like depends on whether your roofs 

2321
02:00:53,051 --> 02:00:54,640
new or old.
So if you're roof new you don't want to 

2322
02:00:54,640 --> 02:00:57,091
replace the roof,
you want to put solar panels on the 

2323
02:00:57,091 --> 02:00:57,091
roof.
Um,

2324
02:00:57,091 --> 02:00:57,091
so that's like retrofit,
you know,

2325
02:00:57,170 --> 02:00:59,240
and they were trying to make the 
retrofit Pendleton Grill Nice.

2326
02:00:59,720 --> 02:01:00,500
Um,
and then,

2327
02:01:00,530 --> 02:01:03,160
but then the new product we're coming 
out with is if you,

2328
02:01:03,161 --> 02:01:08,161
if you have a roof that's either you're 
building a house or you're going to 

2329
02:01:08,161 --> 02:01:08,830
replace your roof anyway,
then you make the site,

2330
02:01:08,840 --> 02:01:13,840
the tiles have solar,
solar cells embedded in the tiles and 

2331
02:01:14,451 --> 02:01:19,451
then it's quite a tricky thing because 
you want to not see the solar cell 

2332
02:01:19,451 --> 02:01:21,730
behind the glass tile.
Uh,

2333
02:01:21,830 --> 02:01:26,210
so you have to really work with the 
glass and,

2334
02:01:26,211 --> 02:01:26,650
and,
and the,

2335
02:01:26,830 --> 02:01:31,830
and the various coatings and layers so 
that you don't see the solar cell behind

2336
02:01:32,481 --> 02:01:34,250
the glass,
otherwise it doesn't look right.

2337
02:01:34,400 --> 02:01:36,350
Right.
So it's really tricky.

2338
02:01:36,470 --> 02:01:38,300
There's this shame and put it up there.
Yeah,

2339
02:01:38,510 --> 02:01:40,150
that looks good.
See,

2340
02:01:40,500 --> 02:01:43,390
like if you look closely,
you can see if you're zooming in,

2341
02:01:43,400 --> 02:01:44,420
right?
You can see the,

2342
02:01:44,940 --> 02:01:49,940
you can see the cell,
but if you zoom out you don't see the 

2343
02:01:49,940 --> 02:01:49,940
sale.
Right.

2344
02:01:49,940 --> 02:01:52,250
Well it looks cool though.
That's hard.

2345
02:01:52,280 --> 02:01:55,130
It's really hard because you have to 
have sunlight go through.

2346
02:01:55,420 --> 02:01:58,310
Right.
But when it gets reflected back out,

2347
02:01:58,790 --> 02:01:59,540
it doesn't,
it,

2348
02:01:59,800 --> 02:02:02,000
it hides the fact that there's a sale 
there.

2349
02:02:02,090 --> 02:02:07,090
Now.
Are those available to the consumer 

2350
02:02:07,090 --> 02:02:07,090
right now?
Well,

2351
02:02:07,090 --> 02:02:08,690
we have a,
I think those on that roof right there.

2352
02:02:08,900 --> 02:02:10,250
Yes.
That's amazing.

2353
02:02:11,210 --> 02:02:12,830
Oh,
that looks good.

2354
02:02:13,340 --> 02:02:14,780
Yeah.
Ooh,

2355
02:02:14,840 --> 02:02:16,180
I liked that one too.
Smart.

2356
02:02:16,670 --> 02:02:21,670
Oh,
so you get that kind of fake Spanish 

2357
02:02:21,670 --> 02:02:21,670
looking thing.
I like French late.

2358
02:02:21,670 --> 02:02:24,560
That's why people in Connecticut smoking
pipes will get that one.

2359
02:02:24,800 --> 02:02:28,040
Yeah.
That's bad ass dude.

2360
02:02:28,220 --> 02:02:31,010
So those will actually work,
I believe you.

2361
02:02:31,160 --> 02:02:31,910
So the,
the,

2362
02:02:31,920 --> 02:02:36,920
the,
the solar panels that are on that house 

2363
02:02:36,920 --> 02:02:39,641
that we just looked at,
is that sufficient to power the entire 

2364
02:02:39,641 --> 02:02:39,641
home?

2365
02:02:40,010 --> 02:02:42,790
It depends on your energy on how.
Yeah.

2366
02:02:42,800 --> 02:02:43,610
Yeah.
So,

2367
02:02:44,480 --> 02:02:47,390
um,
generally yes.

2368
02:02:47,630 --> 02:02:50,540
I would say it's probably for most it's 
going to vary,

2369
02:02:50,541 --> 02:02:55,541
but anywhere from more than you need to 
maybe half,

2370
02:02:57,290 --> 02:03:02,290
like half to one point.
Five of the energy that you need 

2371
02:03:02,290 --> 02:03:06,760
depending on how much roof you have 
relative to living space and how 

2372
02:03:06,760 --> 02:03:08,870
ridiculous you are with the TV.
TV is no problem.

2373
02:03:08,960 --> 02:03:10,320
Air Conditioning,
air conditioning,

2374
02:03:10,930 --> 02:03:14,990
air conditioning is the problem.
If you have an efficient air conditioner

2375
02:03:15,680 --> 02:03:20,680
and you don't,
and depending on how like are you at 

2376
02:03:20,680 --> 02:03:22,710
conditioning rooms when they don't need 
to be air conditioned,

2377
02:03:22,730 --> 02:03:27,730
which is very common because it's a pain
in the neck and it was like programming 

2378
02:03:27,730 --> 02:03:30,451
or BCR.
It's like right now it's just blinking 

2379
02:03:30,451 --> 02:03:33,941
12.
I'll tell people just like to hell with 

2380
02:03:33,941 --> 02:03:35,800
that.
I'm just gonna make it this temperature 

2381
02:03:35,800 --> 02:03:37,301
all day long.
Don't have a smart home where if you're 

2382
02:03:37,301 --> 02:03:37,301
in the room then it stays cool.
Right?

2383
02:03:37,301 --> 02:03:42,220
Yeah.
It should predict when you're going to 

2384
02:03:42,220 --> 02:03:42,860
be home and then cool.
The room,

2385
02:03:43,130 --> 02:03:47,060
the rooms that you're likely to use with
a little bit of intelligence.

2386
02:03:47,061 --> 02:03:49,520
We're not talking about like genius home
here.

2387
02:03:49,521 --> 02:03:52,220
We're just talking like elementary basic
stuff.

2388
02:03:54,230 --> 02:03:59,230
You know,
like if you could hook that into the 

2389
02:03:59,230 --> 02:03:59,230
car,
like knows you're coming home.

2390
02:03:59,230 --> 02:03:59,720
Like there's no point in calling the 
home,

2391
02:03:59,920 --> 02:04:02,570
keeping the,
keeping the home really cool when you're

2392
02:04:02,600 --> 02:04:04,840
not there,
but I can tell that you're coming home.

2393
02:04:04,850 --> 02:04:06,620
What's going to cool it to the right 
temperature,

2394
02:04:06,621 --> 02:04:11,621
right.
We have an editor that works with your 

2395
02:04:11,621 --> 02:04:12,940
solar panels or anything like that.
Yeah,

2396
02:04:13,330 --> 02:04:18,330
yeah,
we do and we need to hook it into the 

2397
02:04:18,330 --> 02:04:18,330
air conditioning to.
I really make the air conditioning work.

2398
02:04:18,330 --> 02:04:20,410
Have you thought about creating an air 
conditioning system?

2399
02:04:21,250 --> 02:04:26,250
I know you have a trick question.
I cannot answer questions about ritual 

2400
02:04:29,360 --> 02:04:31,420
potential.
Let's just let it go.

2401
02:04:31,421 --> 02:04:34,240
We'll move on to the next thing,
but that would be an interesting idea.

2402
02:04:34,910 --> 02:04:37,120
Yeah,
I would say radiant heating,

2403
02:04:37,350 --> 02:04:37,830
all that

2404
02:04:38,580 --> 02:04:40,310
good ideas.
Now when you,

2405
02:04:40,380 --> 02:04:45,380
when you think about the efficiency of 
these homes and you think about 

2406
02:04:45,380 --> 02:04:49,670
implementing solar power and battery 
power and is there anything else that 

2407
02:04:50,131 --> 02:04:52,080
people are missing?
Is there any other.

2408
02:04:52,081 --> 02:04:57,081
Like I just saw a smartwatch that is 
powered by the heat of the human body.

2409
02:04:58,770 --> 02:05:01,950
Some new technology is able to fully 
power that way.

2410
02:05:02,040 --> 02:05:05,220
I don't know if it's fully or if it's 
like this watch right here.

2411
02:05:05,221 --> 02:05:10,221
This is a casio,
it's called a pro tech and it's in like 

2412
02:05:10,221 --> 02:05:14,901
an outdoors watch and solar powered and 
so it has the ability to operate for a 

2413
02:05:14,901 --> 02:05:18,270
certain amount of time on solar.
So if you have it exposed,

2414
02:05:18,360 --> 02:05:21,180
it could function for a certain amount 
of time on solar.

2415
02:05:21,480 --> 02:05:21,840
Yeah.
Well,

2416
02:05:21,900 --> 02:05:23,280
you know,
I'm like,

2417
02:05:23,281 --> 02:05:26,160
there's this health lighting watches 
where it's just got to wait in the watch

2418
02:05:26,161 --> 02:05:31,161
and as you move your wrist,
the weight moves from one side to the 

2419
02:05:31,161 --> 02:05:31,161
other and it winds the watch up.

2420
02:05:31,170 --> 02:05:32,600
That's a pretty cool thing.
Yeah.

2421
02:05:32,750 --> 02:05:35,310
Yeah.
It's amazing that Rolex is that it's all

2422
02:05:35,311 --> 02:05:40,311
done mechanically.
There's no batteries in there and it's 

2423
02:05:40,311 --> 02:05:40,311
no nothing.
Yeah,

2424
02:05:40,311 --> 02:05:43,551
you could do the same thing.
Create a little charger that's based on 

2425
02:05:43,551 --> 02:05:46,880
a risk movement.
It really depends on how much energy or 

2426
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:46,880
what she uses.
You know,

2427
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:50,811
what's fucked up about that though.
We accept a certain amount of like 

2428
02:05:50,811 --> 02:05:52,200
fuckery with those watches.
Like I brought my watch,

2429
02:05:52,210 --> 02:05:57,210
I have a rolex that uh,
my friend Lorenzo gave me and I brought 

2430
02:05:57,210 --> 02:06:00,711
it to the watch store and I said,
this thing's always fast.

2431
02:06:01,890 --> 02:06:06,890
I said,
it's always like after a couple months 

2432
02:06:06,890 --> 02:06:06,890
it's like five minutes fast and they go,
Yep,

2433
02:06:07,630 --> 02:06:08,130
bigly.
Yeah.

2434
02:06:08,350 --> 02:06:09,770
It's just what it does.
Okay,

2435
02:06:09,810 --> 02:06:11,220
well hold on.
I go.

2436
02:06:11,221 --> 02:06:13,860
So you telling me that it just is always
going to be fast.

2437
02:06:13,890 --> 02:06:14,730
They just like,
yeah.

2438
02:06:14,940 --> 02:06:17,250
It's just like every few months you 
gotta reset.

2439
02:06:17,251 --> 02:06:19,080
It seems like they should recalibrate 
that thing.

2440
02:06:19,380 --> 02:06:20,730
They can't.
They tried.

2441
02:06:20,850 --> 02:06:24,540
They see every few months with it's four
months or five months or six months.

2442
02:06:24,720 --> 02:06:26,940
It's going to be a couple minutes fast.
Okay.

2443
02:06:26,941 --> 02:06:31,941
It seems like they should really 
recalibrate that because if it's always 

2444
02:06:31,941 --> 02:06:34,530
fast you can just delete those minutes.
You need to fucking kicked down the door

2445
02:06:34,531 --> 02:06:36,960
at Rolex and go,
you bitches are lazy.

2446
02:06:39,410 --> 02:06:44,410
It's kind of amazing that you can keep 
time mechanically on a wristwatch with 

2447
02:06:44,410 --> 02:06:44,670
these tiny little gears.
It's amazing.

2448
02:06:44,790 --> 02:06:49,790
Yeah,
I mean the whole luxury watch market is 

2449
02:06:49,790 --> 02:06:49,790
fascinating.
I,

2450
02:06:49,790 --> 02:06:50,280
I'm,
I'm,

2451
02:06:50,350 --> 02:06:54,420
I'm not that involved in,
in terms of like I don't buy them.

2452
02:06:54,421 --> 02:06:56,610
I bought them as gifts so I don't buy 
them for myself,

2453
02:06:56,611 --> 02:07:01,611
but when I look at them online,
if there's million dollar watches out 

2454
02:07:01,611 --> 02:07:03,540
there now that are like,
they have like little rotating moons and

2455
02:07:03,541 --> 02:07:06,720
stars and they live like,
look at this thing.

2456
02:07:06,840 --> 02:07:09,980
How much does that one,
Jamie [inaudible] preposterous.

2457
02:07:10,830 --> 02:07:15,830
I like gears.
I just love them and it looked 

2458
02:07:15,830 --> 02:07:18,950
beautiful,
but there's some of these people that 

2459
02:07:18,950 --> 02:07:20,781
are just taking it right in the ass.
They buying these watches for like 

2460
02:07:20,781 --> 02:07:20,781
$750,000.
I'm like,

2461
02:07:20,781 --> 02:07:21,870
Yo,
that's a timex son.

2462
02:07:22,380 --> 02:07:27,380
Nobody knows.
It's not any better than some cassio 

2463
02:07:27,380 --> 02:07:27,390
that you could just buy online.

2464
02:07:27,420 --> 02:07:28,320
Like,
look at that though.

2465
02:07:28,680 --> 02:07:29,610
Well,
here's the thing.

2466
02:07:30,360 --> 02:07:35,360
If you're a person that doesn't,
just want to know the time you want 

2467
02:07:35,830 --> 02:07:39,370
craftsmanship,
you want some artisans touch.

2468
02:07:39,820 --> 02:07:44,820
You want innovation in terms of like a 
person figuring out how gears and cogs 

2469
02:07:46,061 --> 02:07:50,890
all line up perfectly to every time it 
turns over,

2470
02:07:50,891 --> 02:07:54,070
it's basically a second.
I mean that's just.

2471
02:07:54,250 --> 02:07:58,390
There's art to that.
It's not just telling time,

2472
02:07:58,590 --> 02:08:00,040
hey,
I like this watch a lot,

2473
02:08:00,041 --> 02:08:01,960
but if it got hit by a rock,
I wouldn't be sad.

2474
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:07,560
It's just a watch.
It's a mass produced thing that runs on 

2475
02:08:07,560 --> 02:08:09,680
some courts battery,
but those things that's.

2476
02:08:09,700 --> 02:08:10,810
There's art to that.
No,

2477
02:08:10,811 --> 02:08:12,730
I agree.
It's beautiful.

2478
02:08:12,820 --> 02:08:13,740
Yeah.
Yeah.

2479
02:08:13,910 --> 02:08:14,890
Love it.
Yeah.

2480
02:08:15,250 --> 02:08:17,260
There's something.
There's something amazing about it.

2481
02:08:17,500 --> 02:08:22,500
It's a.
because it represents the human 

2482
02:08:22,500 --> 02:08:22,500
creativity.
It's not just.

2483
02:08:22,500 --> 02:08:25,990
It's not just a electronic innovation.
There's something.

2484
02:08:25,991 --> 02:08:29,520
There's a person's work in that.
Yes,

2485
02:08:30,190 --> 02:08:32,980
but you don't have a watch on.
No,

2486
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:34,420
ever.
I used to have a watch.

2487
02:08:34,480 --> 02:08:39,480
What happened?
My phone tells the time point,

2488
02:08:41,110 --> 02:08:42,670
but if you lose your phone,
do you wait?

2489
02:08:42,700 --> 02:08:43,990
Hold on,
let me guess.

2490
02:08:44,470 --> 02:08:48,340
You are a no case guy.
That's correct.

2491
02:08:50,680 --> 02:08:53,640
On the edge.
Grasse Tyson,

2492
02:08:53,650 --> 02:08:55,540
neela grass titus who was in here last 
week.

2493
02:08:55,830 --> 02:08:58,810
I'm marveled at his ability to get 
through life without a case.

2494
02:08:59,560 --> 02:09:01,210
That's right.
You know,

2495
02:09:01,211 --> 02:09:04,660
he takes his phone and he flips it in 
between his fingers like,

2496
02:09:04,690 --> 02:09:05,660
like a,
like a.

2497
02:09:05,770 --> 02:09:10,770
A soldier would do it.
His rifle or his roles that shed in 

2498
02:09:10,770 --> 02:09:10,770
between his fingers.
Okay.

2499
02:09:10,780 --> 02:09:11,920
Marvelous.
Wow.

2500
02:09:12,130 --> 02:09:13,630
He says that's the reason why they do 
it.

2501
02:09:13,780 --> 02:09:18,780
He said,
when you look at someone who has a 

2502
02:09:18,780 --> 02:09:18,780
rifle,
why would they do that?

2503
02:09:18,940 --> 02:09:21,160
Why would they flip it around like that?
Right.

2504
02:09:21,370 --> 02:09:24,640
So that when it goes to drop,
they have it in their hand,

2505
02:09:24,820 --> 02:09:27,970
they catch it quickly.
So that's what he does with his phone.

2506
02:09:28,060 --> 02:09:29,590
He's just flipping his phone around all 
the time.

2507
02:09:30,430 --> 02:09:33,040
I got that in Mexico.
I was hoping it holds joint,

2508
02:09:34,330 --> 02:09:37,020
doesn't do anything.
It seems to open it just as a host,

2509
02:09:37,021 --> 02:09:38,620
a whole storage store,
things in there,

2510
02:09:38,860 --> 02:09:42,220
but like try to put a joint in there and
close it.

2511
02:09:42,310 --> 02:09:47,250
You put like one,
one blunt one,

2512
02:09:48,450 --> 02:09:50,550
but it seems pretentious,
you know,

2513
02:09:51,480 --> 02:09:54,660
that's the idea behind it.
I bought it when I was in Mexico because

2514
02:09:54,661 --> 02:09:59,020
I figured it'd be a good size to hold 
joints or

2515
02:10:03,400 --> 02:10:07,690
so.
Is that a joint or is it a cigar?

2516
02:10:08,040 --> 02:10:10,110
You know,
it's um,

2517
02:10:10,180 --> 02:10:12,790
marijuana inside of a tobacco.
Oh,

2518
02:10:12,800 --> 02:10:15,400
okay.
So it's like plot plot tobacco never had

2519
02:10:15,401 --> 02:10:16,060
that.
Yeah,

2520
02:10:16,061 --> 02:10:17,590
I think I tried one once.
Come on,

2521
02:10:17,591 --> 02:10:21,180
man,
probably can't because stockholders,

2522
02:10:21,190 --> 02:10:23,800
right?
I mean,

2523
02:10:23,801 --> 02:10:24,580
it's legal,
right?

2524
02:10:24,630 --> 02:10:25,930
It's totally legal.
Okay.

2525
02:10:26,740 --> 02:10:31,740
How does it work?
Do People get upset at you if you do 

2526
02:10:31,740 --> 02:10:33,130
certain things?
A backhoe and marijuana in there,

2527
02:10:33,790 --> 02:10:34,060
that's all

2528
02:10:34,070 --> 02:10:34,370
it is.

2529
02:10:38,060 --> 02:10:40,950
Did the combination of tobacco and 
marijuana is wonderful?

2530
02:10:42,090 --> 02:10:45,750
First turned onto it by Charlie Murphy 
and then reignited by Dave Chappelle

2531
02:10:47,180 --> 02:10:49,360
plus whiskey.
Exactly.

2532
02:10:49,400 --> 02:10:51,640
Perfect.
Balances it out.

2533
02:10:53,420 --> 02:10:55,520
Alcohol is a drug that's been 
grandfathered in.

2534
02:10:56,210 --> 02:10:56,820
Well,
it's not just.

2535
02:10:57,180 --> 02:11:00,420
It's a drug that gets a bad rap because 
you could just have a little.

2536
02:11:00,421 --> 02:11:02,790
It's great.
Fine.

2537
02:11:03,060 --> 02:11:08,060
Yeah.
A little sip here and there and just 

2538
02:11:08,060 --> 02:11:10,530
your inhibitions are relaxed and it 
shows your true self and hopefully 

2539
02:11:10,530 --> 02:11:12,540
you're more joyous and friendly and 
happy and everything's good.

2540
02:11:13,910 --> 02:11:16,350
The real worry is that people that can't
handle it,

2541
02:11:16,351 --> 02:11:21,351
like the real worried about people who 
can handle cars that can go zero to 60 

2542
02:11:21,351 --> 02:11:25,791
in one point nine seconds or anything.
Have you ever considered something that 

2543
02:11:26,550 --> 02:11:31,550
like imagine if one day everyone has a 
car that's on the same,

2544
02:11:31,860 --> 02:11:36,860
at least technological standard is one 
of your cars and everyone agrees that 

2545
02:11:37,410 --> 02:11:40,530
the smart thing to do is not just to 
have bumpers,

2546
02:11:40,890 --> 02:11:44,160
but to perhaps have some sort of a 
magnetic repellent device,

2547
02:11:44,370 --> 02:11:49,370
something,
some electro magnetic field around the 

2548
02:11:49,370 --> 02:11:49,590
cars.
As cars come close to each other,

2549
02:11:49,591 --> 02:11:54,591
they automatically radically decelerate 
because of magnets or something.

2550
02:11:56,230 --> 02:12:01,230
Well,
I mean our cars brake automatically 

2551
02:12:01,230 --> 02:12:01,230
break.
Yeah.

2552
02:12:01,230 --> 02:12:01,230
Yeah.
When they see things,

2553
02:12:01,230 --> 02:12:05,580
yes,
but look a physical barrier like a.

2554
02:12:06,010 --> 02:12:07,370
well,
the wheels work pretty well.

2555
02:12:07,630 --> 02:12:12,630
We'll know pretty well decelerated at 
one point,

2556
02:12:12,641 --> 02:12:14,920
one to one point two g's,
that kind of thing.

2557
02:12:15,290 --> 02:12:20,290
Is there a concern that one day all your
cars will be on the road and there 

2558
02:12:20,290 --> 02:12:23,440
they'll still be regular people with 
regular cars 20,

2559
02:12:23,460 --> 02:12:28,460
30 years from now that'll get in the mix
and be the the main problem?

2560
02:12:31,180 --> 02:12:36,180
Yeah.
I think it was sort of like know it was 

2561
02:12:36,180 --> 02:12:38,401
a time of transition where there were 
horses and gasoline cars in the road at 

2562
02:12:38,401 --> 02:12:39,100
the same time.
It's been pretty weird.

2563
02:12:39,710 --> 02:12:41,320
Oh,
that would be the weirdest.

2564
02:12:41,500 --> 02:12:43,540
Yeah.
Horses were tricky.

2565
02:12:43,541 --> 02:12:46,360
You don't want to be back in a Manhattan
had like 300,000

2566
02:12:46,361 --> 02:12:50,740
horses.
You figure like horse lives.

2567
02:12:50,741 --> 02:12:53,050
Fifteen years.
Got 20,000

2568
02:12:53,051 --> 02:12:56,890
horses that Robin Dad every day or every
year I should say every year.

2569
02:12:56,891 --> 02:12:57,730
20,000
horses.

2570
02:12:57,731 --> 02:13:02,731
If this 300,000
horses in 15 year lifespan back in the 

2571
02:13:02,731 --> 02:13:05,740
gangs in New York days.
That movie.

2572
02:13:06,700 --> 02:13:08,530
Yeah.
It's a lot of dead horses now.

2573
02:13:08,560 --> 02:13:11,250
You need a dead horse to move the horse.
Right?

2574
02:13:11,310 --> 02:13:16,310
The probably get pretty freaked out if 
they have to a dead horse because they 

2575
02:13:16,310 --> 02:13:16,940
know what's going on.
Yeah,

2576
02:13:16,941 --> 02:13:20,350
I mean it's pretty weird.
No,

2577
02:13:20,390 --> 02:13:24,550
I would imagine dragon this dead horse 
around and I'm a horse.

2578
02:13:26,580 --> 02:13:27,750
Do you ever stop,
stop

2579
02:13:28,050 --> 02:13:33,050
and think about your role in.
Do you ever stop and think about your 

2580
02:13:33,050 --> 02:13:34,950
role in the culture?
Because me as a person who never met you

2581
02:13:34,951 --> 02:13:36,780
until today,
when I think of you,

2582
02:13:37,200 --> 02:13:39,090
you know,
I've always thought of you as being this

2583
02:13:39,360 --> 02:13:44,360
weirdo super inventor dude who just 
somehow or another keeps coming up with 

2584
02:13:44,360 --> 02:13:48,351
new shit,
but there's not a lot of you out there 

2585
02:13:48,351 --> 02:13:51,100
like everybody else seems to be.
I mean obviously you make a lot of money

2586
02:13:51,101 --> 02:13:52,350
and there's a lot of people that make a 
lot of money.

2587
02:13:52,940 --> 02:13:55,230
Like that clock.
Yeah.

2588
02:13:55,620 --> 02:13:56,410
Pretty Dope.
Right?

2589
02:13:56,460 --> 02:13:57,470
This is a great clock.
Yeah.

2590
02:13:57,480 --> 02:13:58,590
You want one?
I'll get you one.

2591
02:13:58,650 --> 02:13:59,450
Sure.
Okay.

2592
02:14:00,050 --> 02:14:02,070
Done.
I like weird things like this.

2593
02:14:02,100 --> 02:14:03,120
Oh,
this is the coolest.

2594
02:14:03,180 --> 02:14:06,180
Is tgt promotion.
What is his tgt studios?

2595
02:14:06,540 --> 02:14:08,820
Tgt Studios.
Yeah.

2596
02:14:09,900 --> 02:14:11,850
To a gentleman who makes all this by 
hand.

2597
02:14:13,720 --> 02:14:14,520
Yeah.
It's really cool.

2598
02:14:15,120 --> 02:14:18,150
With study is filled with where devices.
Well,

2599
02:14:18,151 --> 02:14:19,890
get ready for another one.
All right.

2600
02:14:20,160 --> 02:14:21,360
I'm sending it your way.
Well,

2601
02:14:21,540 --> 02:14:25,100
you want to Werewolf to hook you up.
All right.

2602
02:14:26,790 --> 02:14:29,040
I'll take one.
One a werewolf and 1:00

2603
02:14:29,041 --> 02:14:29,520
coming up.

2604
02:14:30,590 --> 02:14:32,600
Do you think about your role in the 
culture?

2605
02:14:32,601 --> 02:14:34,760
Because me as a person,
they ever met you until today.

2606
02:14:35,210 --> 02:14:36,980
I've always looked at you and like,
wow,

2607
02:14:36,981 --> 02:14:39,290
like how's this guy just keep inventing 
shit.

2608
02:14:39,560 --> 02:14:41,630
Like how do you,
how do you keep coming up with all these

2609
02:14:41,631 --> 02:14:46,370
new devices and what do you ever 
consider how anew?

2610
02:14:46,400 --> 02:14:51,400
Like I had a dream once that there was a
million tesla's instead of like one 

2611
02:14:51,921 --> 02:14:53,690
tesla,
there was a million.

2612
02:14:53,700 --> 02:14:56,870
Tesla's not Chesley the car,
but Nicola.

2613
02:14:57,470 --> 02:14:58,340
Oh yeah,
sure.

2614
02:14:58,341 --> 02:15:03,341
And that in his day there was a million 
people like him who were radically 

2615
02:15:03,560 --> 02:15:05,540
innovative.
It was a weird dream,

2616
02:15:05,541 --> 02:15:10,541
man.
It was so strange and I've had it more 

2617
02:15:10,541 --> 02:15:11,330
once the results in a very rapid 
technology innovation,

2618
02:15:11,480 --> 02:15:13,790
that's for sure.
It's one of the only dreams in my life.

2619
02:15:13,791 --> 02:15:15,410
I've had more than one time.
Okay.

2620
02:15:15,460 --> 02:15:17,630
Like where I've woken up and it's in the
same dream,

2621
02:15:17,780 --> 02:15:22,350
I'm in the same dream and in this dream 
it's 19 forties,

2622
02:15:22,370 --> 02:15:27,050
19 fifties,
but everyone is severely advanced.

2623
02:15:27,050 --> 02:15:32,050
There's flying blimps with lcd screens 
on the side of them and everything is 

2624
02:15:32,050 --> 02:15:36,131
bizarre and strange and it stuck with me
for whatever it.

2625
02:15:36,440 --> 02:15:39,080
Obviously this is just a stupid dream,
but for whatever reason,

2626
02:15:39,470 --> 02:15:42,890
all these years that stuck with me like 
it takes one man,

2627
02:15:43,220 --> 02:15:48,220
like Nikola Tesla to have more than a 
hundred inventions that were patents.

2628
02:15:49,581 --> 02:15:51,620
Right?
I mean he had some pretty great,

2629
02:15:52,190 --> 02:15:55,850
pretty fucking amazing ideas.
Yes.

2630
02:15:55,970 --> 02:16:00,260
But there was in his day there was very 
few people like him because it's true.

2631
02:16:00,920 --> 02:16:04,790
What if there was a million,
like what exists advance very quickly.

2632
02:16:04,900 --> 02:16:06,620
Right.
But there's not a million.

2633
02:16:06,621 --> 02:16:11,621
Elon Musk's is one motherfucker.
Do you have think about that?

2634
02:16:12,320 --> 02:16:17,320
We just try to not.
Hm.

2635
02:16:24,690 --> 02:16:29,690
I don't think.
I don't think you'd necessarily want to 

2636
02:16:29,690 --> 02:16:29,690
be me.
I.

2637
02:16:29,690 --> 02:16:29,690
Well,

2638
02:16:30,510 --> 02:16:32,890
what's the worst part about it?
If people would like it that much,

2639
02:16:32,920 --> 02:16:35,000
well most people wouldn't,
but they can't be you.

2640
02:16:36,040 --> 02:16:39,460
So that's like,
that's like some superhero type Shit,

2641
02:16:40,420 --> 02:16:45,420
you know?
He wouldn't want to be spiderman rather 

2642
02:16:45,420 --> 02:16:46,270
this sleep tight and Gotham city.
I hope he's out there doing his job.

2643
02:16:48,450 --> 02:16:50,410
It's very hard to turn it off.
Yeah.

2644
02:16:51,160 --> 02:16:53,820
What's the hardest part?
Might sound great to me,

2645
02:16:54,340 --> 02:16:59,340
but what if it doesn't turn off?
Now I showed you the isolation tank and 

2646
02:16:59,340 --> 02:17:03,790
you've never experienced that before.
I think that could help you turn it off 

2647
02:17:03,790 --> 02:17:05,470
a little bit just for the night.
Yeah,

2648
02:17:05,500 --> 02:17:09,250
just give you a little bit of sleep.
A little bit of perspective is magnesium

2649
02:17:09,251 --> 02:17:11,110
that you get from the water as well.
That makes you,

2650
02:17:11,500 --> 02:17:14,140
makes you sleep easier because the water
has epsom salts in it,

2651
02:17:15,010 --> 02:17:19,630
but maybe some sort of strategy for 
sacrificing your,

2652
02:17:19,631 --> 02:17:24,631
a biologic or not sacrificing but 
enhancing your biological recovery time 

2653
02:17:25,210 --> 02:17:30,210
by figuring out a way,
whether it's through meditation or some 

2654
02:17:30,210 --> 02:17:33,040
other ways to shut off that.
That thing at night.

2655
02:17:34,450 --> 02:17:38,620
Like you must have like a constant 
stream of ideas.

2656
02:17:38,621 --> 02:17:39,880
It's running through your head all the 
time.

2657
02:17:42,230 --> 02:17:45,040
Getting text messages from checks.
No.

2658
02:17:45,500 --> 02:17:46,910
Uh,
I,

2659
02:17:47,390 --> 02:17:50,360
I'm getting text messages from friends 
saying,

2660
02:17:50,420 --> 02:17:52,730
what the hell are you doing?
Smoking weed?

2661
02:17:53,450 --> 02:17:54,670
Is that bad for you?
It's legal.

2662
02:17:56,390 --> 02:17:58,160
It's got to be an approved.
It's not,

2663
02:17:58,290 --> 02:17:59,750
you know,
uh,

2664
02:18:00,080 --> 02:18:03,380
I'm not a regular smoker of weed.
How often you smoke it?

2665
02:18:04,370 --> 02:18:05,210
Almost never.

2666
02:18:05,610 --> 02:18:06,040
Mm.

2667
02:18:08,670 --> 02:18:09,470
I mean it's,
it's,

2668
02:18:10,560 --> 02:18:12,630
I don't actually notice any effect.
Well,

2669
02:18:12,660 --> 02:18:14,580
there you go.
There was a time where,

2670
02:18:14,670 --> 02:18:18,990
I think it was ram das or someone gave 
some Buddhist monk bunch acid.

2671
02:18:19,680 --> 02:18:24,680
Okay.
And he ate it and it had no effect on 

2672
02:18:24,680 --> 02:18:26,040
them.
I doubt that I would say that too,

2673
02:18:26,041 --> 02:18:31,041
but I've never meditated to the level 
that some of these people that were 

2674
02:18:31,041 --> 02:18:33,540
there constantly meditating all day,
they don't have any material possessions

2675
02:18:33,930 --> 02:18:38,160
and all of their energy is spent trying 
to achieve a certain mindset.

2676
02:18:38,430 --> 02:18:43,430
I would like to cynically deny that.
I'd like to cynically say contagious 

2677
02:18:43,430 --> 02:18:48,321
fucking think the same way I do.
They just hang out with flip flops on 

2678
02:18:48,321 --> 02:18:51,970
and make weird noises,
but maybe now you know,

2679
02:18:52,860 --> 02:18:57,860
I,
I know a lot of people like reed and 

2680
02:18:57,860 --> 02:19:00,450
that's fine,
but I don't find that it is very good to

2681
02:19:00,451 --> 02:19:02,880
full productivity for you,
but for me,

2682
02:19:03,390 --> 02:19:04,160
yeah,
it's definitely.

2683
02:19:04,260 --> 02:19:05,820
I would imagine that for someone like 
you,

2684
02:19:05,821 --> 02:19:10,020
it's not someone like you,
it,

2685
02:19:10,360 --> 02:19:12,680
it'd be more like a cup coffee.
Right?

2686
02:19:12,690 --> 02:19:14,850
You want your latte?
Yeah.

2687
02:19:14,851 --> 02:19:16,470
That's more like the opposite of a cup 
of coffee,

2688
02:19:16,900 --> 02:19:18,590
a cup of coffee and reverse.
Oh,

2689
02:19:18,620 --> 02:19:19,650
weed is.
No.

2690
02:19:19,651 --> 02:19:22,110
I'm saying you would like more,
more like,

2691
02:19:22,111 --> 02:19:24,090
will it be beneficial to you?
It'd be like coffee.

2692
02:19:24,900 --> 02:19:27,530
I like to get things done.
I like to be useful.

2693
02:19:27,940 --> 02:19:28,370
Um,

2694
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:32,210
that is one of the hardest things to do 
is to be useful.

2695
02:19:32,300 --> 02:19:37,300
When you say you like to get things done
in terms of like what you get to 

2696
02:19:37,300 --> 02:19:38,510
satisfaction when you complete a 
project,

2697
02:19:38,540 --> 02:19:43,540
when something,
something that you invent comes to 

2698
02:19:43,540 --> 02:19:46,121
fruition and you see people enjoying it.
That feeling yes.

2699
02:19:46,280 --> 02:19:50,150
Doing something useful for other people 
that I liked doing.

2700
02:19:51,200 --> 02:19:55,440
That's interesting for other people.
Yes.

2701
02:19:56,220 --> 02:20:01,220
So that.
Do you think that that is maybe the way 

2702
02:20:01,220 --> 02:20:04,851
you recognize that you have this unusual
position in the culture where you can 

2703
02:20:04,851 --> 02:20:09,050
uniquely influence certain things 
because of this?

2704
02:20:09,980 --> 02:20:12,060
I mean you essentially have a gift,
right?

2705
02:20:12,210 --> 02:20:17,210
I mean you would think it was a curse,
but I'm sure it's been fueled by many,

2706
02:20:18,001 --> 02:20:20,280
many years of discipline and,
and learning,

2707
02:20:20,700 --> 02:20:24,030
but you essentially have a gift and that
you have this

2708
02:20:25,550 --> 02:20:30,530
radical sort of creativity engine when 
it comes to innovation and technology.

2709
02:20:30,560 --> 02:20:35,560
It's like you're just,
you're going at a very high rpm all the 

2710
02:20:35,560 --> 02:20:37,920
time.
What does that last and stuff?

2711
02:20:39,500 --> 02:20:42,260
I don't know what would've happened if I
got into a sensory deprivation tank.

2712
02:20:42,350 --> 02:20:47,350
Let's try.
It sounds concerning like running the 

2713
02:20:47,391 --> 02:20:50,650
engine with no resistance.
That.

2714
02:20:50,790 --> 02:20:53,180
Is that what it is though?
Maybe it's not.

2715
02:20:53,290 --> 02:20:56,030
Maybe it's fine.
I don't know how I'll try it.

2716
02:20:56,600 --> 02:21:01,600
I'll try it.
Have you ever experimented with 

2717
02:21:01,600 --> 02:21:03,270
meditation or anything?
Yes.

2718
02:21:03,530 --> 02:21:05,480
What do you do or what have you done 
rather?

2719
02:21:08,780 --> 02:21:13,780
I mean you just sort of sit there and 
required and then repeat some mantra 

2720
02:21:15,570 --> 02:21:19,890
which acts as a focal point.
It's still the mind.

2721
02:21:20,120 --> 02:21:25,120
It just stolen mind,
but I don't find myself drawn to it 

2722
02:21:25,291 --> 02:21:30,291
frequently.
Do you think that perhaps productivity 

2723
02:21:31,770 --> 02:21:36,770
is maybe more attractive to you then 
enlightenment and or even the concept of

2724
02:21:38,551 --> 02:21:40,650
whatever enlightenment means.
Like what are you trying to achieve when

2725
02:21:40,651 --> 02:21:43,130
you're meditating all the time?
What would you.

2726
02:21:43,140 --> 02:21:48,140
It seems like almost like there's a 
frantic ness to your creativity that 

2727
02:21:48,140 --> 02:21:50,430
comes out of this,
this burning furnace,

2728
02:21:50,970 --> 02:21:53,490
and in order for you to like calm that 
thing down,

2729
02:21:53,970 --> 02:21:56,940
he got thrown.
Might have to throw it too much water on

2730
02:21:56,941 --> 02:21:57,090
it.

2731
02:21:59,180 --> 02:22:04,180
It's like a never ending explosion.
Like what is it like I try and explain 

2732
02:22:05,591 --> 02:22:10,591
it to a dumb person like me.
What's going on at her and never under 

2733
02:22:11,201 --> 02:22:13,510
any explosion.
It's just constant ideas.

2734
02:22:13,840 --> 02:22:15,520
Just bouncing around.
Yes.

2735
02:22:15,910 --> 02:22:18,310
Ooh Damn.
Yeah,

2736
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:22,570
so when everybody leaves,
just Elan sitting at home,

2737
02:22:22,571 --> 02:22:27,571
brushing his teeth.
Just of ideas bouncing around your head 

2738
02:22:27,571 --> 02:22:32,010
the whole time.
When did you realize that that's not the

2739
02:22:32,011 --> 02:22:37,011
case with most people?
I think when I was,

2740
02:22:39,480 --> 02:22:41,010
I don't know,
five or six or something,

2741
02:22:41,370 --> 02:22:45,240
I thought I was insane.
Why do you think you're insane?

2742
02:22:45,900 --> 02:22:47,550
Because it was clear that other people 
did not.

2743
02:22:49,190 --> 02:22:54,190
What?
Their mind wasn't exploding with ideas 

2744
02:22:54,190 --> 02:22:54,190
all the time.
They were an expressing it.

2745
02:22:54,190 --> 02:22:58,760
They weren't talking about it all day 
and you realize by the time you were 

2746
02:22:58,760 --> 02:22:58,760
five or six,
like,

2747
02:22:58,760 --> 02:23:01,910
oh,
they're probably not even getting this 

2748
02:23:01,910 --> 02:23:02,730
thing that I'm getting.
No,

2749
02:23:03,510 --> 02:23:06,560
it was just strange.
It was like,

2750
02:23:08,090 --> 02:23:09,680
hmm,
that's strange.

2751
02:23:11,330 --> 02:23:12,830
That was my conclusion.
I asked range,

2752
02:23:13,520 --> 02:23:17,360
but did you feel diminished by it in any
way?

2753
02:23:17,570 --> 02:23:22,570
Like knowing that this is a weird thing 
that you really probably couldn't 

2754
02:23:22,570 --> 02:23:25,960
commiserate with with other people,
they wouldn't understand that you hope 

2755
02:23:25,960 --> 02:23:27,860
they wouldn't find out because they 
might put me away with something.

2756
02:23:27,890 --> 02:23:29,750
You thought that for a second.
Yes.

2757
02:23:30,230 --> 02:23:32,350
When you were little and the other 
people are wearing.

2758
02:23:32,360 --> 02:23:34,370
Or what if they put money away?
Like when you were little,

2759
02:23:34,371 --> 02:23:36,160
you thought this,
wow.

2760
02:23:36,800 --> 02:23:41,800
Like you thought this is so radically 
different than the people that are 

2761
02:23:41,800 --> 02:23:43,160
around me.
If they find out I got the stream coming

2762
02:23:43,161 --> 02:23:44,750
in.
Yeah.

2763
02:23:45,140 --> 02:23:48,760
Wow.
But,

2764
02:23:48,800 --> 02:23:50,910
you know,
I was only like five or six really.

2765
02:23:51,250 --> 02:23:53,390
Like,
do you think this is like.

2766
02:23:53,391 --> 02:23:57,200
I mean there's,
there's outliers biologically.

2767
02:23:58,810 --> 02:24:01,310
You mean there's people that are seven 
foot nine.

2768
02:24:01,311 --> 02:24:06,311
There's people that have giant hands is 
people that have eyes that are 20 slash 

2769
02:24:06,311 --> 02:24:07,370
15 vision.
There's always outliers.

2770
02:24:08,510 --> 02:24:09,090
Um,

2771
02:24:10,680 --> 02:24:13,620
do you feel like you're caught this?
Like you have got some,

2772
02:24:14,270 --> 02:24:19,270
you're like on some weird innovation,
creativity sort of wave.

2773
02:24:21,760 --> 02:24:25,960
That's very unusual.
Like you tapped into.

2774
02:24:26,890 --> 02:24:27,670
I mean,
just think of the,

2775
02:24:27,690 --> 02:24:32,690
the,
the various things you've been able to 

2776
02:24:32,690 --> 02:24:33,100
accomplish in a very short amount of 
time and you're constantly doing this.

2777
02:24:33,490 --> 02:24:35,620
That's a weird.
You're weird person,

2778
02:24:35,740 --> 02:24:36,700
right?
I agree.

2779
02:24:36,880 --> 02:24:41,880
Yeah.
Like what if there's a million Elon 

2780
02:24:41,880 --> 02:24:45,660
Musk's?
Well that would be very weird.

2781
02:24:48,250 --> 02:24:49,270
Woo.
Yeah,

2782
02:24:49,280 --> 02:24:50,370
that'd be pretty weird.
Like,

2783
02:24:50,371 --> 02:24:52,210
are real weird.
Definitely.

2784
02:24:54,710 --> 02:24:56,920
Yeah.
What if they're a million show rockets?

2785
02:24:57,790 --> 02:25:02,790
The probably is probably too many and I 
mean,

2786
02:25:05,471 --> 02:25:08,140
I think that's the case with a lot of 
folks.

2787
02:25:09,480 --> 02:25:10,330
Yeah.
I mean,

2788
02:25:11,170 --> 02:25:12,000
but like,
uh,

2789
02:25:12,090 --> 02:25:14,710
you know,
my goal is like try to useful things,

2790
02:25:16,630 --> 02:25:18,600
try to maximize it.
Probably the is good.

2791
02:25:19,270 --> 02:25:24,270
Um,
make the future exciting when you look 

2792
02:25:24,270 --> 02:25:24,270
forward to,

2793
02:25:24,490 --> 02:25:27,130
you know,
know with,

2794
02:25:27,210 --> 02:25:29,760
uh,
you know,

2795
02:25:29,850 --> 02:25:33,000
with Tesla or like try and make things 
that people love you.

2796
02:25:33,010 --> 02:25:34,730
I was like,
not like kit.

2797
02:25:34,990 --> 02:25:39,990
How are you?
How many things can you buy that you 

2798
02:25:39,990 --> 02:25:40,210
really love,
that really give you joy?

2799
02:25:40,960 --> 02:25:42,550
So rare,
so rare.

2800
02:25:42,610 --> 02:25:47,610
I wish there were more things.
That's what we're trying to make things 

2801
02:25:47,610 --> 02:25:47,920
that somebody loves.

2802
02:25:48,700 --> 02:25:53,700
When you,
when you think about making someone 

2803
02:25:53,700 --> 02:25:53,700
loves,
like,

2804
02:25:53,700 --> 02:25:57,240
do you specifically think about like 
what things would improve people's 

2805
02:25:57,240 --> 02:25:58,000
experience?
Like what,

2806
02:25:58,001 --> 02:26:02,980
what would change the way people 
interface with life that would make them

2807
02:26:03,640 --> 02:26:08,640
more relaxed or more happy?
You really think like when you thinking 

2808
02:26:09,921 --> 02:26:12,170
about things like that,
is that one of your considerations?

2809
02:26:12,171 --> 02:26:17,171
Like what?
What can I do that would help people 

2810
02:26:17,171 --> 02:26:17,171
that maybe they wouldn't be able to 
figure it out?

2811
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:18,760
Yeah.
Like how,

2812
02:26:19,380 --> 02:26:23,310
like what are the set of things that can
be done to make the future better?

2813
02:26:23,820 --> 02:26:26,220
Like you know,
like,

2814
02:26:26,221 --> 02:26:31,221
so I think the future where we are a 
space fairing civilization and out there

2815
02:26:31,561 --> 02:26:34,800
among the stars.
This is very exciting.

2816
02:26:35,190 --> 02:26:39,510
This makes me look forward to a future.
This makes me want that future.

2817
02:26:40,640 --> 02:26:43,170
You know,
the things that need to be,

2818
02:26:43,171 --> 02:26:47,160
things that make you look forward to 
waking up in the morning,

2819
02:26:47,161 --> 02:26:52,161
you wake up in the morning,
you look forward to the day before to 

2820
02:26:52,161 --> 02:26:54,801
the future and a future where we are 
spacefaring civilization and out there 

2821
02:26:55,221 --> 02:26:57,020
among the stars.
I think that's very exciting.

2822
02:26:57,410 --> 02:27:01,520
That is a thing we want.
Whereas if,

2823
02:27:02,090 --> 02:27:04,400
if you knew we would not be a space 
frank civilization,

2824
02:27:04,401 --> 02:27:07,070
but forever confined to Earth,
this would not be a good future.

2825
02:27:07,071 --> 02:27:08,840
That would be very sad.
I think

2826
02:27:09,610 --> 02:27:14,190
it would be the future of the,
the just the finite lifespan,

2827
02:27:14,400 --> 02:27:18,800
the earth itself and the solar system 
itself that even though it's possibly,

2828
02:27:19,010 --> 02:27:19,890
you know what I mean?
How many,

2829
02:27:20,250 --> 02:27:24,150
how long do they feel like the sun and 
the solar system is going to exist?

2830
02:27:24,600 --> 02:27:25,920
How many hundreds of millions of years.

2831
02:27:27,650 --> 02:27:29,750
Well,
it's probably,

2832
02:27:30,320 --> 02:27:32,570
if you're saying the windows,
the sun boil the ocean,

2833
02:27:32,580 --> 02:27:32,990
right?

2834
02:27:35,330 --> 02:27:38,190
For about 500 million years.
So is,

2835
02:27:38,250 --> 02:27:43,080
is it sad that we never leave because in
500 million years that happens?

2836
02:27:43,110 --> 02:27:43,950
Is that what you're saying?

2837
02:27:45,940 --> 02:27:50,940
No,
I just think like if there are two 

2838
02:27:50,940 --> 02:27:53,281
futures and one futurists,
we're out there among the stars and the 

2839
02:27:53,281 --> 02:27:54,340
things we read about and see in science 
fiction movies,

2840
02:27:54,580 --> 02:27:58,550
the good ones are true and we have these
starships and we're,

2841
02:28:00,220 --> 02:28:05,220
we're,
we're going to see what other planets 

2842
02:28:05,220 --> 02:28:07,471
are like and where a multitenant species
and the scope and scale of consciousness

2843
02:28:07,971 --> 02:28:12,971
is expanded across many civilizations.
And many planets and many star systems.

2844
02:28:14,320 --> 02:28:19,320
This is a great future.
This is a wonderful thing to me and 

2845
02:28:20,650 --> 02:28:22,340
that's what we should strive for.

2846
02:28:25,050 --> 02:28:30,050
But that's biological travel.
That's cells traveling physically to 

2847
02:28:30,050 --> 02:28:32,180
another location.
Yes.

2848
02:28:34,570 --> 02:28:36,130
Do you think that's definitely where 
we're going?

2849
02:28:36,700 --> 02:28:37,800
No.
Yeah,

2850
02:28:37,900 --> 02:28:42,900
I don't think so either.
I used to think so and now I'm thinking 

2851
02:28:42,900 --> 02:28:46,471
more likely less than ever.
Like almost every day.

2852
02:28:46,540 --> 02:28:51,540
Less likely.
We can definitely go to the moon and 

2853
02:28:51,540 --> 02:28:51,540
Mars.
Yeah.

2854
02:28:51,540 --> 02:28:53,950
Everything will go to the asteroid belt 
and we can go to the moons of Jupiter.

2855
02:28:55,110 --> 02:28:56,920
Saturn.
You can even get to Pluto.

2856
02:28:57,160 --> 02:29:00,040
That'd be the craziest place ever.
If we colonize Mars and retire,

2857
02:29:00,041 --> 02:29:02,680
formed it and turned it into like a big 
Jamaica.

2858
02:29:05,380 --> 02:29:10,380
Just imagine they're going to be great.
It's.

2859
02:29:10,700 --> 02:29:12,360
There's amazing,
right?

2860
02:29:12,490 --> 02:29:15,830
We turned the whole thing into Cancun.
Well,

2861
02:29:15,940 --> 02:29:18,010
I mean over time it wouldn't be easy,
but yes.

2862
02:29:18,160 --> 02:29:19,870
If you could just want.
You could warm it up.

2863
02:29:19,960 --> 02:29:21,160
Yeah,
you can look it up.

2864
02:29:21,161 --> 02:29:23,470
You could add air.
You get some water there.

2865
02:29:23,620 --> 02:29:28,620
I mean over time,
hundreds of millions of years or 

2866
02:29:28,620 --> 02:29:28,620
whatever it takes.

2867
02:29:28,620 --> 02:29:30,640
We're going to be a multiplanetary vcs.
That would be amazing species.

2868
02:29:30,650 --> 02:29:34,030
That's to be like air conditioning.
Sad.

2869
02:29:34,031 --> 02:29:35,710
I'm pro human.
Me Too.

2870
02:29:36,790 --> 02:29:37,800
Yeah,
me too.

2871
02:29:37,810 --> 02:29:39,460
I love humanity.
I think it's great.

2872
02:29:39,640 --> 02:29:44,640
We're glad as a robot that you love 
humans because we love you too.

2873
02:29:44,951 --> 02:29:46,690
And we don't want you to kill us and eat
us.

2874
02:29:47,200 --> 02:29:49,420
And uh,
I mean strangely,

2875
02:29:49,421 --> 02:29:51,880
I think a lot of people don't like 
humanity and see it as a blight,

2876
02:29:51,910 --> 02:29:54,190
but I do not.
But I think one of those,

2877
02:29:54,490 --> 02:29:56,410
I think part of that it's just they've 
been,

2878
02:29:56,680 --> 02:29:58,000
you know,
they've been struggling.

2879
02:29:58,300 --> 02:30:00,580
When people struggle,
they associate their struggle with other

2880
02:30:00,581 --> 02:30:04,000
people.
They never internalize their problems.

2881
02:30:04,001 --> 02:30:09,001
They looked to other people is holding 
them back and people suck and fuck 

2882
02:30:09,001 --> 02:30:09,001
people and it's just,
you know,

2883
02:30:09,030 --> 02:30:10,750
it's a neverland.
Never ending cycle,

2884
02:30:14,420 --> 02:30:16,520
but not always.
Again,

2885
02:30:16,670 --> 02:30:20,630
most people are really good.
Most people,

2886
02:30:20,750 --> 02:30:23,240
the vast majority.
This may sound Corny,

2887
02:30:23,450 --> 02:30:26,870
it does sound Corny,
but love is the answer is the answer.

2888
02:30:27,070 --> 02:30:28,850
Yep.
Yeah,

2889
02:30:28,940 --> 02:30:33,940
it is.
It sounds quite because we're all 

2890
02:30:33,940 --> 02:30:33,940
scared,
you know,

2891
02:30:33,940 --> 02:30:37,151
we're all scared of trying to love 
people being rejected or someone take 

2892
02:30:37,331 --> 02:30:39,980
advantage of you because you're trying 
to be loving.

2893
02:30:40,110 --> 02:30:45,110
Sure.
But if we all could just relax and love 

2894
02:30:45,110 --> 02:30:45,110
each other,

2895
02:30:46,600 --> 02:30:47,980
wouldn't hurt to have more love in the 
world.

2896
02:30:48,940 --> 02:30:50,360
It definitely wouldn't hurt.
Yeah,

2897
02:30:50,410 --> 02:30:51,440
it'd be great.
Yeah,

2898
02:30:51,550 --> 02:30:52,900
we should do that.
Yeah.

2899
02:30:53,260 --> 02:30:55,810
I agreement really.
How do you fix that?

2900
02:30:55,811 --> 02:30:59,310
You have a love machine,
you know,

2901
02:30:59,440 --> 02:31:04,440
but to probably spend more time with 
your friends and less time on social 

2902
02:31:04,961 --> 02:31:08,860
media now deleting social media from 
your applications,

2903
02:31:08,861 --> 02:31:13,861
from your phones and other that give you
a 10 percent boost to happiness was the 

2904
02:31:14,620 --> 02:31:15,310
percentages.

2905
02:31:18,880 --> 02:31:20,640
I think probably something like that.
Yeah.

2906
02:31:20,660 --> 02:31:23,320
It's about a good 10 percent.
Yeah.

2907
02:31:23,520 --> 02:31:25,860
I mean,
I mean,

2908
02:31:25,861 --> 02:31:30,861
the only thing I've kept as twitter 
because I kind of like need some means 

2909
02:31:30,861 --> 02:31:31,390
of getting a message out,
you know?

2910
02:31:31,620 --> 02:31:32,680
Right.
Um,

2911
02:31:33,900 --> 02:31:38,190
well that's about it.
So far so good.

2912
02:31:38,790 --> 02:31:40,170
Well,
what's interesting with you,

2913
02:31:40,171 --> 02:31:45,171
you,
he actually occasionally engage with 

2914
02:31:45,171 --> 02:31:45,630
people on twitter.
Yeah.

2915
02:31:45,720 --> 02:31:48,240
It's what percentage of that is a good 
idea?

2916
02:31:48,820 --> 02:31:53,820
Ha.
Good to question 10 percent.

2917
02:32:00,510 --> 02:32:02,970
It's mostly,
I think it's unbalanced.

2918
02:32:02,971 --> 02:32:05,760
More good than bad,
but there's definitely some bad.

2919
02:32:06,810 --> 02:32:10,170
So do you ever.
Hopefully the good outweighs the bad.

2920
02:32:10,980 --> 02:32:15,980
Do you ever think about how odd it is,
that weird feeling that you get when 

2921
02:32:15,980 --> 02:32:16,710
someone says something Shitty to you on 
twitter and you read it,

2922
02:32:17,010 --> 02:32:20,430
that weird feeling,
this weird little negative Joel.

2923
02:32:20,940 --> 02:32:24,750
It's like a subjective negative jolt of 
energy they don't really need to absorb,

2924
02:32:24,751 --> 02:32:25,650
but you do anyway.
Like,

2925
02:32:25,651 --> 02:32:30,651
well fuck the score for Kim.
I mean there's a lot of negativity on 

2926
02:32:31,381 --> 02:32:32,250
twitter.
It is,

2927
02:32:32,251 --> 02:32:37,251
but it's a weird.
It's in its form like the way if you 

2928
02:32:37,251 --> 02:32:40,701
ingest it as if you're like you try to 
be like a little scientist as you're 

2929
02:32:40,701 --> 02:32:41,040
ingesting it,
you're like,

2930
02:32:41,041 --> 02:32:42,210
wow,
where does this?

2931
02:32:42,470 --> 02:32:47,470
And I'm even getting upset at some 
strange person saying something mean to 

2932
02:32:47,470 --> 02:32:49,320
me it's not even accurate.

2933
02:32:51,330 --> 02:32:54,240
I mean the vast number of negative 
comments,

2934
02:32:54,660 --> 02:32:58,290
a syllabus for the vast majority who I 
just ignore them.

2935
02:32:58,380 --> 02:32:59,730
The vast majority.
Yeah.

2936
02:33:00,380 --> 02:33:03,180
Every now and again,
get drawn in somewhat good.

2937
02:33:03,650 --> 02:33:05,340
It's not good.
Make mistakes.

2938
02:33:05,610 --> 02:33:06,930
Yes,
you could make mistakes.

2939
02:33:07,090 --> 02:33:09,390
We make some mistakes.
We're all human.

2940
02:33:09,630 --> 02:33:11,340
We can make mistakes.
Yeah,

2941
02:33:12,420 --> 02:33:15,630
it's hard and people love it.
When you say something and you'd take it

2942
02:33:15,631 --> 02:33:16,710
back and they're like,
fuck you.

2943
02:33:16,711 --> 02:33:20,850
We saved it forever.
Fucking screenshot that shit bitch.

2944
02:33:20,851 --> 02:33:24,300
You had that thought you had that 
thought like,

2945
02:33:24,301 --> 02:33:25,530
well,
I deleted it.

2946
02:33:25,650 --> 02:33:29,010
Not good enough.
Who had the thought?

2947
02:33:29,100 --> 02:33:34,100
I'm better than you.
I never had that thought you had that 

2948
02:33:34,100 --> 02:33:34,100
thought.
You piece of shit.

2949
02:33:34,100 --> 02:33:34,100
Look,
I saved it.

2950
02:33:34,200 --> 02:33:36,460
I put it on my blog.
Yeah,

2951
02:33:36,780 --> 02:33:41,780
sure why people think that that anyone 
would think that deleting a tweet that 

2952
02:33:41,780 --> 02:33:43,500
makes them go away.
It was like,

2953
02:33:43,501 --> 02:33:43,920
hello.

2954
02:33:43,970 --> 02:33:45,730
Then the Internet for awhile.
Yeah,

2955
02:33:46,280 --> 02:33:51,280
but it's even like anything is they 
don't forever you to be able to delete 

2956
02:33:51,280 --> 02:33:54,801
it because the problem is if you don't 
delete it and you don't believe it 

2957
02:33:54,801 --> 02:33:55,560
anymore,
it's really hard to say,

2958
02:33:55,561 --> 02:33:56,730
hey,
that thing above,

2959
02:33:56,940 --> 02:34:00,300
I don't really believe that anymore.
I changed the way I view things.

2960
02:34:00,350 --> 02:34:01,260
Yes,
because people go,

2961
02:34:01,270 --> 02:34:03,150
well,
fuck you already have that over there.

2962
02:34:03,151 --> 02:34:08,151
I'm going to just take that.
I'm not going to pay attention to that 

2963
02:34:08,151 --> 02:34:08,151
shit.
You wrote her.

2964
02:34:08,151 --> 02:34:11,160
It's on your permanent record forever.
Tattoo on your permanent record.

2965
02:34:11,640 --> 02:34:12,900
Yeah.
It's like a tattoo.

2966
02:34:13,530 --> 02:34:14,580
You keep it.
Oh yeah.

2967
02:34:14,850 --> 02:34:15,990
Yeah.
Well,

2968
02:34:15,991 --> 02:34:17,560
it's,
it's this thing where there's,

2969
02:34:17,590 --> 02:34:17,990
it's,
it's

2970
02:34:18,250 --> 02:34:20,230
a,
there's a lack of compassion,

2971
02:34:20,231 --> 02:34:24,220
so lack of compassion issue.
People just like intentionally shitty to

2972
02:34:24,221 --> 02:34:27,010
each other all the time online and 
trying to catch me.

2973
02:34:27,260 --> 02:34:32,260
It's more trying to catch people doing 
something that's arrestable like a cop 

2974
02:34:32,260 --> 02:34:33,860
trying to like get,
you know,

2975
02:34:34,070 --> 02:34:39,070
arrests on as his record.
It's like they're trying to catch you 

2976
02:34:39,070 --> 02:34:41,650
with something more than.
They're logically looking at it thinking

2977
02:34:41,651 --> 02:34:45,340
it's a bad thing that you've done or the
idea they don't agree with so much.

2978
02:34:45,341 --> 02:34:46,300
They need to insult you.

2979
02:34:46,820 --> 02:34:48,720
Trying to catch you.
Yeah,

2980
02:34:49,250 --> 02:34:54,250
I mean it's way easier to be mean on 
social media than it is to be mean in 

2981
02:34:54,250 --> 02:34:54,690
person.
Yes.

2982
02:34:54,860 --> 02:34:56,160
Way Easier.
Yeah.

2983
02:34:56,350 --> 02:34:58,080
Yeah.
It's weird.

2984
02:34:58,170 --> 02:35:03,170
It's,
it's not a normal way of humans 

2985
02:35:03,170 --> 02:35:03,170
interacting.
It's cheating.

2986
02:35:03,170 --> 02:35:04,240
You're not supposed to be able to 
interact so easily,

2987
02:35:04,510 --> 02:35:06,660
but people were not looking at.
Yes.

2988
02:35:06,940 --> 02:35:11,940
You would never do that.
You'd never be so mean to somebody 

2989
02:35:11,940 --> 02:35:11,940
looking in their eyes and if you did,
you'd feel like shit.

2990
02:35:11,940 --> 02:35:12,700
Most people.
Yeah.

2991
02:35:12,701 --> 02:35:15,430
Unless you're a sociopath,
you'd feel terrible.

2992
02:35:15,970 --> 02:35:20,050
Yes.
Elon Musk.

2993
02:35:20,610 --> 02:35:22,000
This has been a pleasure.
Yeah,

2994
02:35:22,060 --> 02:35:23,290
likewise.
Really has been.

2995
02:35:23,291 --> 02:35:25,000
It's been an honor.
Thank you for having me.

2996
02:35:25,330 --> 02:35:27,220
Thanks for doing this because,
uh,

2997
02:35:27,310 --> 02:35:30,820
I know you don't do a lot of a long form
stuff like this.

2998
02:35:31,270 --> 02:35:34,120
I hope I didn't weird you out and hope 
you don't get mad that you smoke weed.

2999
02:35:35,790 --> 02:35:37,870
It's legal.
We're in California.

3000
02:35:37,900 --> 02:35:40,630
This is justice legal.
This whiskey we've been drinking.

3001
02:35:41,410 --> 02:35:42,820
Exactly.
This is all good.

3002
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:43,800
Right?
Jaris.

3003
02:35:44,470 --> 02:35:49,470
Thank you.
Is there any message you would like to 

3004
02:35:49,470 --> 02:35:52,231
put out other than love's the answer 
because I think you really nailed it 

3005
02:35:52,231 --> 02:35:52,231
with that.

3006
02:35:53,170 --> 02:35:53,860
No,
I think,

3007
02:35:53,861 --> 02:35:58,861
you know,
I think people should be nicer to each 

3008
02:35:58,861 --> 02:36:00,630
other and give people and give,
give more credit to,

3009
02:36:00,640 --> 02:36:05,640
to others and don't assume that they're 
mean until you know they're actually 

3010
02:36:05,640 --> 02:36:08,740
mean,
you know,

3011
02:36:08,980 --> 02:36:11,830
just,
it's easy to demonize people,

3012
02:36:13,690 --> 02:36:17,230
usually wrong about it.
People a nicer than you think.

3013
02:36:19,930 --> 02:36:22,930
Get people more credit.
I couldn't agree more.

3014
02:36:23,080 --> 02:36:23,730
And,
uh,

3015
02:36:23,840 --> 02:36:28,840
I want to thank you not just for all the
crazy innovations you've come up with 

3016
02:36:28,840 --> 02:36:33,301
and your constant flow of ideas,
but that you choose to spread that idea,

3017
02:36:34,450 --> 02:36:35,490
which is,
it's a,

3018
02:36:35,500 --> 02:36:38,920
it's a very vulnerable,
but it's very honest and I,

3019
02:36:38,921 --> 02:36:41,830
it resonated with me and I believe it.
I believe it's true too.

3020
02:36:42,130 --> 02:36:44,020
So thank you.
Oh,

3021
02:36:44,021 --> 02:36:46,750
you assholes out there.
Be Nice.

3022
02:36:47,020 --> 02:36:48,040
Be Nice,
bitch.

3023
02:36:48,120 --> 02:36:49,510
All right.
Thank you everybody.

3024
02:36:49,511 --> 02:36:50,360
Thanks.
All right,

3025
02:36:50,970 --> 02:36:51,210
ready?
