1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,061
Drive by day,

2
00:00:01,061 --> 00:00:03,730
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:05,590
What he's done it,

4
00:00:05,591 --> 00:00:06,850
Floyd Mayweather retires.

5
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:08,640
He's done the,

6
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,390
the thing that nobody ever does,

7
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:15,570
he went out on top undefeated with
all the money after having fought all

8
00:00:16,151 --> 00:00:16,984
challengers.

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,480
I mean he might've fought pack out late,

10
00:00:19,481 --> 00:00:21,340
but you can't deny that
he fought all challengers.

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,570
Who gives a fuck w I mean
the 50 things seems to be a,

12
00:00:26,571 --> 00:00:28,210
an issue or not an issue.

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,230
40 to 50 now whether or not
he wants to break the record,

14
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:32,690
I mean,

15
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:33,670
well how much of that is,

16
00:00:33,671 --> 00:00:33,921
is,

17
00:00:33,921 --> 00:00:35,740
is the ego that's going to last for,

18
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,880
I mean he's still pretty young,

19
00:00:36,881 --> 00:00:37,300
right?

20
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,133
Yeah.

21
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:38,800
I mean he's,

22
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,930
I think he's 36 if I had to guess,

23
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:42,580
but he's in really good shape.

24
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:45,130
I mean he takes care
of himself really well.

25
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:50,610
He's like notoriously disciplined about
workouts and he'll even go out at night,

26
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:53,111
go to a nightclub,

27
00:00:53,111 --> 00:00:53,944
drink water,

28
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,610
and then work out at two o'clock in the
morning cause he has his own gym and his

29
00:00:57,611 --> 00:00:58,241
own thing.

30
00:00:58,241 --> 00:00:58,810
And you know,

31
00:00:58,810 --> 00:00:59,710
he works hard.

32
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,520
You don't get that good on just talent.

33
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:04,271
You know,

34
00:01:04,271 --> 00:01:08,050
you get that good on talent and
discipline and hard fucking work.

35
00:01:08,051 --> 00:01:10,270
There's just no way around it and smart.

36
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:11,410
You gotta be smart too.

37
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,310
You gotta be sneaky.

38
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:13,420
You've gotta be clever.

39
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,131
Do you see,

40
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:14,460
uh,

41
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,110
who he is training right now for a fight?

42
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:16,701
Yeah.

43
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:17,670
He's a trained soldier.

44
00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:18,504
Boy.

45
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,960
Soulja boy is really going
to fight Chris Brown.

46
00:01:23,961 --> 00:01:24,794
Is that real?

47
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,980
I mean it doesn't seem like it,

48
00:01:26,981 --> 00:01:29,560
but it's been talked
about for a few days now.

49
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,390
Apparently it's going to be on paper view,

50
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:32,800
um,

51
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,760
in fighting over a girl.

52
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:35,410
I don't,

53
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:36,310
I'm going to tell you right now,

54
00:01:36,311 --> 00:01:38,230
Chris Brown's going to
fuck him up probably.

55
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:39,413
Yeah.

56
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,530
That's an angry dude.

57
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:40,861
But see,

58
00:01:40,861 --> 00:01:42,000
that dude is on the left with the red.

59
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,410
That's a real angry dude.

60
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:44,850
The other dude,

61
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,250
I just do not think he is as angry

62
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,530
but ever known was man.

63
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,850
I've never seen either of them in person,

64
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:55,861
any one of them.

65
00:01:55,861 --> 00:02:00,300
Maybe Soulja boy's been hide some sick
boxing skills and just pretending this

66
00:02:00,301 --> 00:02:00,960
whole time.

67
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,793
I doubt it.

68
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:02,141
See,

69
00:02:02,141 --> 00:02:04,750
I feel like Chris Brown is
probably punched a lot more people,

70
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,213
you know,

71
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:07,510
don't you think?

72
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,140
I don't know.

73
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:08,620
All,

74
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:08,951
you know,

75
00:02:08,951 --> 00:02:11,050
wife beating girl beating jokes aside.

76
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,730
He's definitely seems like a dude who
is much more likely to punch people.

77
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:17,600
Um,

78
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,110
maybe,

79
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,160
maybe more likely to,

80
00:02:19,161 --> 00:02:22,580
but I couldn't really see mo neither
either of them getting in like a street

81
00:02:22,581 --> 00:02:23,151
fighter or anything.

82
00:02:23,151 --> 00:02:26,810
They've been pretty famous for most
of their life and pretending to,

83
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:27,980
hmm.

84
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:28,813
Interesting.

85
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,200
Since they're in their teens,

86
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,833
um,

87
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,123
two guys,

88
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,791
shit happens.

89
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:37,250
So I mean they might have thrown
some darn down once or twice.

90
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:37,671
Oh,

91
00:02:37,671 --> 00:02:37,821
Bill,

92
00:02:37,821 --> 00:02:38,660
here's another thing.

93
00:02:38,661 --> 00:02:40,370
Here's another reason
why I say Chris Brown.

94
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,560
Chris Brown's a real fucking dancer.

95
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:43,940
He ever see that guy move?

96
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:44,750
Oh yeah,

97
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:44,931
yeah.

98
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:46,700
He could do some crazy shit.

99
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,010
He's really good in basketball.

100
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:49,430
Really good in basketball.

101
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,060
Listen,

102
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,230
this is going to be a blood bath.

103
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,953
I might be wrong.

104
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,203
What'd you buy it?

105
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,493
Yes.

106
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,161
Yeah,

107
00:02:58,161 --> 00:02:59,060
I'll fucking buy it.

108
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:00,340
You know?

109
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,620
And if a soldier boy fucks him up,

110
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:02,901
I'll,

111
00:03:02,901 --> 00:03:03,734
I'll apologize.

112
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,360
Have A,

113
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,460
I was trying to think about this.

114
00:03:05,461 --> 00:03:06,750
Hasn't there been other things?

115
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,081
I mean,

116
00:03:07,081 --> 00:03:09,540
I know you were supposedly
supposed to fight Wesley snipes,

117
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:12,180
but like wasn't there other
things like this ever happened?

118
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,280
I have a whole celebrity boxing show.

119
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,510
I remember that happened a couple.

120
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,420
Yeah.

121
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:16,760
Yeah.

122
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,620
Danny Bonaduce fought screech.

123
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,100
Um,

124
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,480
he fucked up a couple of people.

125
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,510
I remember when I was younger there
was supposed to be a big event where

126
00:03:24,511 --> 00:03:28,110
Shaquille O'Neal was supposed to go one
on one on paper view with this other big

127
00:03:28,111 --> 00:03:29,490
player named a camouflage one.

128
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,050
You're going to box not box.

129
00:03:31,051 --> 00:03:33,390
They were going to come play basketball
one on one for me in dollars,

130
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,710
but it never ended up happening.

131
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,650
I don't know why and when went away,

132
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,440
but I was just kind of
wondering in my head like,

133
00:03:40,441 --> 00:03:41,410
I feel like this has happened.

134
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,440
I've heard things like this
coming up and have like,

135
00:03:43,441 --> 00:03:44,340
or at least been announced,

136
00:03:44,341 --> 00:03:45,570
but they're just kind of fizzle out.

137
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,621
Who knows,

138
00:03:46,621 --> 00:03:47,190
man.

139
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:50,070
I mean people have done crazy shit.

140
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,050
This just seems like a really,

141
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,200
really nutty one and they're
fighting over a girl.

142
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:57,750
I just,

143
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,190
I haven't seen any
evidence of soldier boy,

144
00:04:00,191 --> 00:04:01,160
his athleticism.

145
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,003
He,

146
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,200
somebody put up a video
of him working out.

147
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,870
There's a compilation of him working out.

148
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:07,530
It's,

149
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,630
but it's hard to tell if
he's just being silly,

150
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,273
you know?

151
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:11,911
I was like,

152
00:04:11,911 --> 00:04:12,744
he's a,

153
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,140
he's like shadow boxing and he's
riding an elliptical machine.

154
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,300
He seems like a really young guy.

155
00:04:18,301 --> 00:04:19,134
How old is he?

156
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,780
Oh man,

157
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,210
this twenties still too.

158
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,760
He's in his twenties yeah.

159
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:30,671
Well,

160
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:31,150
there's,

161
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,820
there's a bunch of this
layer of complication.

162
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:34,683
Yeah.

163
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,120
This dude,

164
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,790
whoever they do that was narrated.

165
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,371
It was like,

166
00:04:39,371 --> 00:04:40,240
oh man.

167
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,343
He goes,

168
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,180
you're working out with your socks on.

169
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,360
This is not the same compilation,

170
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,770
but it was pretty funny.
