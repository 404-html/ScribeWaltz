1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,420
Well we're out there,

2
00:00:03,421 --> 00:00:05,130
ladies and gentleman without a net.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,330
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is
brought to you today by marijuana.

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:13,200
Totally.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:13,980
Let's be honest,

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:14,880
just start from the beginning.

7
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,150
Let's say that we know we,

8
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:21,060
we think a lot of things
on this podcast as well.

9
00:00:21,061 --> 00:00:21,480
You know,

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,380
have our sponsors.

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,000
We thank people like the coconut water
people who are not really a sponsor

12
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,343
where,

13
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:29,820
who's not really a sponsor.

14
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:30,900
But God it,

15
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,490
we need to thank marijuana.

16
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,130
Yeah,

17
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:33,963
we really do.

18
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,180
And fuck naked coconut water.

19
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:37,163
We,

20
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,580
that stuff is terrible.

21
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:39,720
I saw you tweet that.

22
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,430
Oh it's so bad.

23
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:44,390
It's totally different than co two o
two o is delicious and sweet boy people

24
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,720
have had the crappy coconut water.

25
00:00:45,721 --> 00:00:47,250
They always talk shit about coconut water.

26
00:00:47,251 --> 00:00:48,370
Like why do you drink that?

27
00:00:48,371 --> 00:00:50,730
And you're trying to be like
trendy like you have no,

28
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:51,750
I had no idea.

29
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,200
Okay.

30
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,670
I found out from my friend Edwin,

31
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,430
he came into Jiu Jitsu class and we had,

32
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:56,760
uh,

33
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,210
it was,

34
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:57,451
you know,

35
00:00:57,451 --> 00:00:59,730
we do a mostly no gauge Jujitsu,

36
00:00:59,731 --> 00:01:04,470
but every now and then a guys
decide to have like a Brazil night.

37
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,120
So they put like gs on,

38
00:01:06,121 --> 00:01:09,390
I brought coconut water and dude gave
me a coconut water and I was like,

39
00:01:09,391 --> 00:01:10,590
well that was nice and you know,

40
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,650
I was like looking forward to this
fucking watered down elephant load,

41
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:16,471
sort of a taste,

42
00:01:16,471 --> 00:01:16,681
you know,

43
00:01:16,681 --> 00:01:20,940
it's a terrible taste and instead
it was sweet and delicious.

44
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:21,331
I was like,

45
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,250
what the fuck kind of
coconut water is this.

46
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:28,320
That's how I found out about two o like
I kept the can and then went online and

47
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:30,080
ordered it on Amazon and I was,

48
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,290
and as soon as it got there I was like,

49
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,690
well let's see if this stuff is
just like the stuff that he had.

50
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:34,111
By the way,

51
00:01:34,111 --> 00:01:35,490
those cans are hardcore.

52
00:01:35,491 --> 00:01:36,130
I bet that like,

53
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:36,370
like,

54
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,460
like when people go through
trash and I find those,

55
00:01:38,461 --> 00:01:38,731
they're like,

56
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:40,110
oh fucking jackpot.

57
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:40,461
I bet there's,

58
00:01:40,461 --> 00:01:41,770
these are worth like $2 or so.

59
00:01:41,771 --> 00:01:44,790
It would be really good if the end of
the world was coming and you wanted to

60
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:48,000
make some sort of a can raft
seal them all up together.

61
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:48,570
Totally.

62
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:49,403
That would work.

63
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:50,280
Yeah,

64
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,113
that's hardcore.

65
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:51,560
Yeah,

66
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,070
there is so delicious.

67
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,440
If you've never liked coconut water,

68
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,910
you need to try one of two things.

69
00:01:56,911 --> 00:01:57,421
First of all,

70
00:01:57,421 --> 00:01:58,800
fresh coconut water,

71
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:03,390
coconut water that's not pasteurized with
the already drilled and has a sticker

72
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:03,781
over it.

73
00:02:03,781 --> 00:02:05,910
And then just peel the sticker
off and drink right from it.

74
00:02:05,911 --> 00:02:06,300
It's great.

75
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,640
That is the best if you can get that,

76
00:02:08,641 --> 00:02:09,710
that is the best fit.

77
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,000
But C two O is a close fucking second.

78
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,020
And when I'm writing,

79
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:13,980
like especially when I'm,

80
00:02:13,981 --> 00:02:14,061
I'm,

81
00:02:14,061 --> 00:02:15,330
I'm brainstorming in my office,

82
00:02:15,331 --> 00:02:17,280
I got the little refrigerator
right next to my desk.

83
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,320
I'll drink four or five of those bitches.

84
00:02:19,321 --> 00:02:21,330
I got to get up to pee
like every 40 minutes.

85
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:21,630
Right?

86
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,530
But they're so good.

87
00:02:22,531 --> 00:02:23,570
It's like it like it,

88
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,090
it,

89
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:27,510
when you're working out hard and
you drink some coconut water,

90
00:02:27,511 --> 00:02:29,100
it feels like the best thing ever.

91
00:02:29,101 --> 00:02:29,934
It feels,

92
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,340
Gatorade feels pretty
good when you're tired,

93
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:32,821
you know,

94
00:02:32,821 --> 00:02:33,151
and you,

95
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:35,010
you work out and like you need something,

96
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,491
something new,

97
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:38,070
something that's a little
more potent and just water.

98
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,240
Gatorade feels good,

99
00:02:39,241 --> 00:02:41,460
but coconut water feels fucking amazing.

100
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:42,390
It's so delicious.

101
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:46,560
And you feel like you're a healthy savage
out there drinking some tropical fruit

102
00:02:46,561 --> 00:02:47,070
juice,

103
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,480
you know Ha.

104
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,860
It's not even choose it's water.

105
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:50,820
I know.

106
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:51,330
It's delicious.

107
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:51,750
Shit.

108
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,890
Super good for you too.

109
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:53,731
I liked that.

110
00:02:53,731 --> 00:02:55,020
When you have the actual coconut though,

111
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,240
cause then you get to
kind of eat at the inside,

112
00:02:57,241 --> 00:02:58,160
like eat with a spoon.

113
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,600
You know c two o just told me they're
going to send me a new case that has pulp

114
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:02,020
in it.

115
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,630
So you,

116
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,900
it's like we had those
from Amy and Brian's,

117
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:05,734
which I like him.

118
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,270
He's like,

119
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:06,550
yeah,

120
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,091
it's a weird,

121
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:07,811
it's a weird thing.

122
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:11,050
You're drinking something and there's
like little chunky chewy things inside of

123
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:11,470
it,

124
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,101
but I like it.

125
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:12,251
Yeah,

126
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:12,940
it's like a goober.

127
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,773
Yeah,

128
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,890
I know.

129
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:15,250
It's true.

130
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,083
It's coconut.

131
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,010
It's like you're getting
a little chewy coconut.

132
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:19,580
You're getting a little fiber in the,

133
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,231
you know,

134
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:20,711
with the,

135
00:03:20,711 --> 00:03:21,660
with the milk.

136
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:22,300
Yeah.

137
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:22,421
Yeah.

138
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:22,930
I don't know.

139
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:23,261
It's,

140
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:23,920
I like it.

141
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,850
It's a weird thing though.

142
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:25,541
It's an acquired taste.

143
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,220
It's like all of us ever had chia seeds.

144
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,750
The Chia drink,

145
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,350
like the stuff that makes the pet grow,

146
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,010
the you sprinkle on it,

147
00:03:36,011 --> 00:03:36,811
she as well.

148
00:03:36,811 --> 00:03:39,130
Could you imagine if there like
somehow or another that was a drug?

149
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,091
Well,

150
00:03:40,091 --> 00:03:40,331
you know,

151
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:42,250
that is the case with a morning glory.

152
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:42,730
Seeds.

153
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:46,150
Did you know that morning glory
seeds are like Super Psychedelic?

154
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,070
Apparently some of them are.

155
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,000
Apparently they've done something to
some of the morning glory seeds that they

156
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:53,650
sell in certain places.

157
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:56,860
You gotta be careful that they
weren't chemically treated to kill the

158
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,870
psychoactive effect of them apparently.

159
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,170
But if you get like pure
morning glory seeds,

160
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,080
it has a very like LSD type effect to it.

161
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,610
I was pretty fucked up

162
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:08,750
Brian.

163
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,520
I lose you.

164
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:09,761
No,

165
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:11,260
I was just thinking of
how I was going to take,

166
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:14,110
I bring this into a fleshlight
commercial where we're rolling,

167
00:04:14,111 --> 00:04:14,381
dude.

168
00:04:14,381 --> 00:04:16,840
It doesn't matter to take off this
logo off your face so they can see the

169
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:17,630
beautiful gyro.

170
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:17,951
You know,

171
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:20,470
don't even do that like
that and the darkness.

172
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,173
Um,

173
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,930
thanks to fucking make shit up.

174
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,160
Thanks to on it.com.

175
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,780
Let's go with them first.

176
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,170
Oh,

177
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:29,860
the fuck.

178
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,693
Why not?

179
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,590
I guess I could have a
boner during this crazy.

180
00:04:32,591 --> 00:04:34,530
Let's close strong with the flashlight,

181
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,240
right.

182
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:35,620
Uh,

183
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:40,600
we have at [inaudible] dot com that's
o and n I t just in a battle ropes and

184
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:42,970
kettle bells is the newest products.

185
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,073
Um,

186
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:49,000
if you're familiar with
anybody who's ever done like,

187
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:49,660
um,

188
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:49,990
uh,

189
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,640
any sort of mixed martial arts training,

190
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,220
have you ever watched like
the UFC countdown shows?

191
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:54,760
Uh,

192
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,760
two really popular methods of
conditioning our kettle bells and a ropes.

193
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,840
I personally have never used the battle
ropes and I'm looking forward to doing

194
00:05:04,841 --> 00:05:04,931
it.

195
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:07,540
But I'm a big proponent of kettle bells.

196
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:10,090
It's essentially the only way
I lift weights these days.

197
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:11,733
I feel like it,

198
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:12,131
it,

199
00:05:12,131 --> 00:05:12,490
uh,

200
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,410
it gives me like what what it is.

201
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,760
If you've never seen him before,

202
00:05:15,761 --> 00:05:17,980
it looks like a bowling
ball with a handle on it.

203
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:21,100
It's a giant ball of lead and you know,

204
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:24,010
you can get them as light as
10 pounds and you can get him,

205
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,281
you know,

206
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:25,114
heavy up,

207
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,040
know you get 70 pounders in night.

208
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:29,740
Some dudes can throw
around like 120 pounders,

209
00:05:29,741 --> 00:05:30,101
like big,

210
00:05:30,101 --> 00:05:30,401
giant,

211
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:31,234
crazy dudes.

212
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,283
Uh,

213
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:33,760
really unnecessary though.

214
00:05:33,761 --> 00:05:34,960
If you want to get a great workout,

215
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:37,180
you can get a great workout
with a 35 pound kettle bell.

216
00:05:37,181 --> 00:05:38,230
It sounds ridiculous,

217
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,430
but there are some,

218
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,031
by the way,

219
00:05:40,031 --> 00:05:42,670
which are sold out now because we've
been talking about them on the podcast.

220
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:42,941
Yeah,

221
00:05:42,941 --> 00:05:43,720
you can't get that.

222
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,000
Tried buying those videos
that we talked about,

223
00:05:46,001 --> 00:05:49,960
the extreme kettlebell cardio workout
dudes are texting me saying that they're

224
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:50,980
sold out everywhere now,

225
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,480
so I'm glad because a,

226
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,760
it's a really good product
and I make no money from that.

227
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:55,720
I just want to let you know,

228
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,980
just letting people know the fuck is good.

229
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,300
I think I just got shocked.

230
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,170
I think you did too.

231
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,470
I saw you move funny thought.

232
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,300
Maybe it was a spider bite and you're
going to turn into a fucking spider man.

233
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,030
I thought this was some
sort of viral marketing.

234
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,160
Jesus Christ.

235
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,840
Isn't there a news places hot?

236
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,201
It's not hot.

237
00:06:13,201 --> 00:06:13,461
Haunted,

238
00:06:13,461 --> 00:06:13,701
man.

239
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:14,480
We got issues.

240
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,380
Just got shocked.

241
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,160
You're going to be okay,

242
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,993
Sweetie.

243
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:18,610
Anyway,

244
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,030
on a.com go check it out.

245
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:22,400
I took my three Alpha brains
right before the show.

246
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,550
What is Alpha Brain Joe?

247
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,550
It is a cognitive enhancing supplement.

248
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:26,360
What does that mean?

249
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,290
It's called the new tropic.

250
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:27,531
What they,

251
00:06:27,531 --> 00:06:28,850
ours are essentially nutrients.

252
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,210
They're supposed to increase
your brain's ability to produce,

253
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,770
to produce neurotransmitters.

254
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:37,380
Now that coming out of my mouth is just
really a bunch of noise because I'm way

255
00:06:37,381 --> 00:06:39,980
too fucking stupid to understand
the science behind any of that.

256
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:40,791
Thankfully,

257
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:43,640
there've been some really intelligent
people that have sort of deciphered it.

258
00:06:43,641 --> 00:06:47,840
If you go to [inaudible] dot com there
is a link where you can get to see the

259
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:52,220
science behind on it and the
science behind nootropics
and I suggested if you're

260
00:06:52,221 --> 00:06:57,050
interested in any sort of vitamin or
supplement or anything that you get to put

261
00:06:57,051 --> 00:06:57,621
into your body,

262
00:06:57,621 --> 00:06:58,970
you should do a little research on it.

263
00:06:58,971 --> 00:06:59,241
I mean,

264
00:06:59,241 --> 00:07:00,380
people don't like to do that,

265
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,910
but I'd just like to take things,

266
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,080
but there's a,

267
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:08,110
there's a lot of research pro and con
about nootropics and about even vitamins.

268
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:12,590
I am a very strong believer in
health and nutrition and vitamins.

269
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,340
I'm a really strong believer
in eating really good food,

270
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:20,600
but I also believe that you
help your body with nutrients.

271
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,500
I've had personal health issues
that I've helped with vitamins.

272
00:07:24,501 --> 00:07:26,870
I know they have a positive
effect on your body.

273
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:27,590
You know,

274
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:32,590
I think you have to just be careful
about what you take into your body on a

275
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:33,500
regular basis.

276
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:38,530
And if you're interested in any
sort of a nootropic formula,

277
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,430
like whether it's on it,

278
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,031
uh,

279
00:07:41,031 --> 00:07:43,280
Alpha brain or a bill Romanowski stuff,

280
00:07:43,281 --> 00:07:46,580
neuro one that I've talked about before
or any of a number of mixtures that

281
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,200
people put together online.

282
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,760
Um,

283
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,391
just Google it.

284
00:07:50,391 --> 00:07:51,500
Google look into that shit.

285
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,420
If you're interested
in getting Alpha brain,

286
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,360
the first 30 pills when you
buy any of our supplements,

287
00:07:56,361 --> 00:07:59,510
first 30 pills are 100%
money back guarantee.

288
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,373
If you don't like it,

289
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,210
you don't even have to
send back in the product.

290
00:08:02,211 --> 00:08:02,630
You just say,

291
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,650
this isn't for me.

292
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:08,330
That's how confident we are first of all
in the product and how much we really

293
00:08:08,331 --> 00:08:10,400
want to make sure that nobody feels
like they're getting ripped off.

294
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,653
That's just a fact.

295
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,300
And if you buy it and you don't
like it and then we're done,

296
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:14,960
it's okay.

297
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,150
It's like everybody's different.

298
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,100
I could not tell you how
your brain functions.

299
00:08:19,101 --> 00:08:20,690
I could not tell you how your body feels.

300
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:25,610
I know for a fact that there's some
supplements that I enjoy that other people

301
00:08:25,611 --> 00:08:28,480
don't enjoy and some shit
that they used that I don't,

302
00:08:28,481 --> 00:08:30,110
I try it and it doesn't
do anything for me.

303
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:34,520
Everybody's system is slightly
tweaked in one way or the other.

304
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,810
So we want make,

305
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,670
make sure that no one feels ripped off.

306
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,720
But these are really good products and
their products that I have been involved

307
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:45,290
with long before I was in a
business relationship with them.

308
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,860
I've always been a fan
of nootropics and uh,

309
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,920
vitamins period.

310
00:08:48,921 --> 00:08:51,920
Go check it out on a.com oh and an ITU.

311
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:52,701

00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:53,870
Save yourself 10% off.

313
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,510
We are also brought to
you by our first and our,

314
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,150
our longest friend and
this podcast venture,

315
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,283
the fleshlight.

316
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:05,400
I just came already from battle ropes
and I don't even have a covered on for

317
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:06,140
this flashlight.

318
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,980
Well I how did you come from battle ropes?

319
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,890
Cause I was thinking about him.

320
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:13,080
Battle ropes making you come girls with
really big boobs swinging those battle

321
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:14,040
ropes around naked.

322
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:14,311
Oh,

323
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:14,790
thank that.

324
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,341
You would,

325
00:09:15,341 --> 00:09:18,240
we worried about that because those girls
maybe could kill you with their hands

326
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,670
and girl could whip those
battle ropes around.

327
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:21,491
Did you,

328
00:09:21,491 --> 00:09:24,900
do you think light salt
sell toys now for women?

329
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,640
Like really high end vibrators,

330
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:27,780
like big dicks?

331
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:27,991
No,

332
00:09:27,991 --> 00:09:28,120
no.

333
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,271
Like,

334
00:09:28,271 --> 00:09:30,770
like really like really
good vibrators now.

335
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:31,201
Oh really?

336
00:09:31,201 --> 00:09:31,381
Yeah.

337
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:31,860
For Women.

338
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,340
The new,

339
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,173
like a new product.

340
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,170
A high end versions.

341
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:35,030
High End.

342
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,500
Yeah.

343
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,331
Like a Mercedes.

344
00:09:36,331 --> 00:09:36,900
Like what is it?

345
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,040
Well not just like a cheap ass,

346
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:38,883
you know,

347
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,190
crappy rabbit or something like that.

348
00:09:41,191 --> 00:09:42,360
They actually sell it as the,

349
00:09:42,361 --> 00:09:43,710
I'm the best one.

350
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,091
What is the,

351
00:09:45,091 --> 00:09:47,400
I mean is there like a
fleshlight of dildos?

352
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:48,270
Yeah.

353
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:48,960
What is it?

354
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,040
Is it the rabbit or something?

355
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,080
Yeah,

356
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,380
you could die over there
if you die over there.

357
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,620
I want you to know I love you.

358
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,160
I want to just,

359
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,450
I'm so selfish of her care.

360
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,050
If he dies,

361
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,270
I just want you to think
good about me before he died.

362
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,493
I don't know what I'm,

363
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:08,403
um,

364
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,380
maybe we should just wrap up.

365
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,140
I'm scared to touch everything now.

366
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,651
Apparently.

367
00:10:13,651 --> 00:10:14,810
Fleshlight how's Dildos?

368
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,420
Dildos?

369
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:15,661
Well,

370
00:10:15,661 --> 00:10:16,081
Brian,

371
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:17,880
we would know he is the expert.

372
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,570
If there's a guy looking for Dildos,

373
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,341
I would say,

374
00:10:23,341 --> 00:10:24,840
do you think Brian knows
who he's talking about?

375
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:25,320
And I'd be like,

376
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:25,621
Oh yeah,

377
00:10:25,621 --> 00:10:27,750
he knows that's a

378
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,500
part of Brian's charm.

379
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,380
He knows shit about dildos

380
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:42,880
that calm and they have a
thing for female toys and uh,

381
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,310
one of them is,

382
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,173
it looks like,

383
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,013
oh Jesus.

384
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:46,521
Oh,

385
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:46,771
okay.

386
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:47,070
They,

387
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:50,460
I think these are the kinds that the
enjoys or what is that what they're,

388
00:10:50,461 --> 00:10:54,270
see dues would be way happier with
vibrators and dildos and stuff if they

389
00:10:54,271 --> 00:10:55,830
weren't shaped like dicks.

390
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,450
If like the best thing for a
woman's pussy was like something,

391
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,740
you know,

392
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,250
mechanical and boxy looking
and you know what I mean?

393
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,170
Like with a tongue and it
just clamp it on the Clinton.

394
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:08,440
It just,

395
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,340
mom,

396
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,550
if that was like a real sex toy,

397
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,660
we would be cool with that.

398
00:11:12,661 --> 00:11:17,030
I think what trips guys out as
these giant Monster Phalynx,

399
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:17,641
you know,

400
00:11:17,641 --> 00:11:19,380
these giant Phallic symbols,

401
00:11:19,381 --> 00:11:20,700
these giant Dildos,

402
00:11:20,701 --> 00:11:21,870
he's fake dicks.

403
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,360
They said Lilo's now that makes sense.

404
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,600
They don't make them Lilo's
they're really high end vibrators.

405
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,190
Like that's what all the girls
then I they know or like,

406
00:11:29,191 --> 00:11:30,024
is that what you're saying?

407
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:30,580
Flashlights?

408
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,070
Hells yeah,

409
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:34,560
they sell Lilo's which is the best.

410
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:39,330
Those are the ones that you know that
like they the alien ware's of alienware's

411
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,653
of dildos.

412
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,550
Wow.

413
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,383
That's really sweet.

414
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,063
That's cool.

415
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:45,481
Brian,

416
00:11:45,481 --> 00:11:46,314
you are silly bitch.

417
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:47,340
Silly Bitch.

418
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,270
How dare you.

419
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:49,290
Um,

420
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:49,860
anyway,

421
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,000
a fleshlight is,

422
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:51,210
uh,

423
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,220
been a long time sponsor of the podcast.

424
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,010
Uh,

425
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:54,491
it's uh,

426
00:11:54,491 --> 00:11:59,110
embarrassing subject for some folks and
it makes me cringe whenever we have a

427
00:11:59,111 --> 00:12:04,111
serious guests on the podcast and I
have to mention that were sponsored by a

428
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:05,134
rubber pussy,

429
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,820
but it's a good product folks.

430
00:12:06,821 --> 00:12:07,540
All right.

431
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,260
And uh,

432
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:08,561
it just,

433
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,500
it is what it is and everybody
needs to settle the fuck down.

434
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,013
All right.

435
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,193
Hip Music.

436
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:14,951
Use a code name,

437
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:18,400
Rogan and it save yourself 15% off
the number one sex toy for men.

438
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,241
That's right.

439
00:12:19,241 --> 00:12:20,074
Bitches

440
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,860
and just when you thought it was
impossible to do that commercial.

441
00:12:23,861 --> 00:12:24,694
A definitely

442
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,183
experience.

443
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,340
Josh Barnett,

444
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:43,400
Josh Barnett is one of those old school
savages that will actually try to drive

445
00:12:43,401 --> 00:12:45,380
a 1969 Oldsmobile.

446
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,880
He liked drives that shit.

447
00:12:46,881 --> 00:12:47,990
Like it's a regular car.

448
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,740
Like he actually gets on the highway is
like I'm going to go somewhere and my

449
00:12:51,741 --> 00:12:53,480
1969 automobile,

450
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:58,520
so his crazy ass drove all the way from
Orange County on the four oh five which

451
00:12:58,521 --> 00:13:01,340
is stopped dead like a
parking lot 90% of the time.

452
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,533
So he dropped.

453
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,830
That's a big exaggeration.

454
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,310
It's not even 50% of the time,

455
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,480
but when it stopped dead,

456
00:13:08,481 --> 00:13:10,130
it's a mother fucker.

457
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,720
It is a motherfucker.

458
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,030
It's hard to wrap your head around
how long it's gonna take you.

459
00:13:14,031 --> 00:13:14,721
Cause if you look,

460
00:13:14,721 --> 00:13:19,721
there's like is your five or six lanes
on each side and some spots at least five

461
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,480
at least five maybe
six lanes on each side.

462
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:28,220
And when I am talking
about there's no room,

463
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,100
it's just all car for miles.

464
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,140
There's no space in between the cars,

465
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:33,901
all the cards.

466
00:13:33,901 --> 00:13:36,290
So even if they started at the beginning,

467
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,920
they started the front of the line and
that guy moves ahead and the next guy

468
00:13:39,921 --> 00:13:41,810
moves behind him and
they all pick up speed.

469
00:13:41,811 --> 00:13:42,644
The highway speed.

470
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,940
You're there for a fucking hour,

471
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:44,420
right?

472
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,171
Because it's just,

473
00:13:45,171 --> 00:13:47,690
just getting these cars to move is insane.

474
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,600
It gives you this sense of futility.

475
00:13:50,601 --> 00:13:51,020
It's like,

476
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,621
you look at it,

477
00:13:51,621 --> 00:13:51,861
you like,

478
00:13:51,861 --> 00:13:53,310
these numbers are impossible.

479
00:13:53,311 --> 00:13:53,660
Is,

480
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,460
is anybody monitoring these numbers?

481
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,220
What happens when they
get completely untenable?

482
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,170
What happens when they're
just unmanageable?

483
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:03,050
What happens when it's
just so beyond belief?

484
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,250
When there's so many cars,

485
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:05,600
no one can move anywhere.

486
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,140
Do we?

487
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:06,973
What do we do then?

488
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:08,803
We fly.

489
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,100
I'll tell you what we don't do.

490
00:14:10,101 --> 00:14:12,680
We don't drive 1969
Oldsmobiles on the highway.

491
00:14:12,681 --> 00:14:13,610
Like they're real cars.

492
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:14,810
Silly.

493
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,580
Having so much fun with my card.

494
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,180
I haven't owned a car that I've
enjoyed for a very long time.

495
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:20,691
Like,

496
00:14:20,691 --> 00:14:23,080
like I now enjoy like,

497
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,250
like flying around in my car.

498
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:25,581
Yeah.

499
00:14:25,581 --> 00:14:25,881
Well,

500
00:14:25,881 --> 00:14:28,220
when you get used to a nimble
car that can move around.

501
00:14:28,221 --> 00:14:29,300
We were talking about this earlier,

502
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:32,240
like about how old cars are.

503
00:14:32,241 --> 00:14:32,830
Um,

504
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,260
we were,

505
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,990
I was actually talking about it
with the staff that old cars,

506
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,300
like when you see like a 1969,

507
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,790
like a corvette or something like that,

508
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:44,450
that's like a work of art made by
a bunch of people in a factory.

509
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:44,871
You know,

510
00:14:44,871 --> 00:14:48,110
they put that thing together and they
screwed those bolts in place and they made

511
00:14:48,111 --> 00:14:50,720
that thing and it has
like this work of art,

512
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,210
sort of a quality to it
that makes it really cool.

513
00:14:53,211 --> 00:14:55,940
But those things drive like shit.

514
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,370
Those things are ridiculously bad.

515
00:14:58,371 --> 00:14:59,900
They did not balanced right.

516
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:04,670
They go out corners all fucked up like
old muscle cars or the dopiest fucking

517
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:05,810
things to drive ever.

518
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:08,090
The really dangerous for the most part,

519
00:15:08,091 --> 00:15:10,520
unless you've completely
up upgraded their breaks,

520
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:11,361
you're like,

521
00:15:11,361 --> 00:15:12,290
I was talking to bill burr.

522
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:14,900
Bill burr has like a 1950 pickup truck.

523
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,620
It's so cool.

524
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,490
It's so cool.

525
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:16,760
It's,

526
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,410
it's sounds awesome.

527
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,460
It's like he opened the hood that you
could climb in there with the engine and

528
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,380
Polish it with a toothbrush.

529
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:24,920
I mean it's,

530
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,320
it's so big and the whole
thing is just ridiculous.

531
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:27,951
Get it.

532
00:15:27,951 --> 00:15:28,250
And you,

533
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,600
you can actually think like,

534
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:29,751
oh,

535
00:15:29,751 --> 00:15:32,210
I could actually work
on this car if I had to.

536
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:32,830
I,

537
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:33,860
I worked on my car growing,

538
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,890
my dad made me work on cars growing
up and I actually could see like,

539
00:15:36,891 --> 00:15:37,191
all right,

540
00:15:37,191 --> 00:15:38,150
that's the engine.

541
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:38,781
That's the,

542
00:15:38,781 --> 00:15:39,170
you know,

543
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,220
the alternator.

544
00:15:40,221 --> 00:15:41,930
That's the club.

545
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:42,430
Yeah.

546
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:42,670
Dot.

547
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,250
It does.

548
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:47,360
I mean that is the thrill about those
kind of cars is that you can go to,

549
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:48,243
you know,

550
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:53,570
some are like dealership and buy
like old parts for an old corvette.

551
00:15:54,351 --> 00:15:55,184
Like you can order room,

552
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:55,851
you know,

553
00:15:55,851 --> 00:15:56,211
I mean you,

554
00:15:56,211 --> 00:15:56,631
you can,

555
00:15:56,631 --> 00:16:01,070
you can go somewhere like I know year one
they make parts for like all old cars.

556
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,740
They make replacement
fenders and make all these,

557
00:16:03,741 --> 00:16:08,741
they started manufacturing shit because
so many people love taking old cars and

558
00:16:08,961 --> 00:16:09,794
redoing them.

559
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:12,200
And this Josh Barnett
is silly for that shit.

560
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,070
He loves it.

561
00:16:13,071 --> 00:16:13,851
He loves cars.

562
00:16:13,851 --> 00:16:14,750
If you look at his Twitter,

563
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:18,200
it's like all like death
metal and muscle cars.

564
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:21,980
Josh Button had to savage,

565
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,900
he's a legit savage.

566
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:24,441
You look at him,

567
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:27,620
he's like clearly got some crazy
viking gene thing going on.

568
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,520
You know.

569
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,400
He wants to dominate the world that
drives muscle cars and listen to death

570
00:16:31,401 --> 00:16:31,880
metal.

571
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,680
It's going to be a
fucking awesome podcast.

572
00:16:33,681 --> 00:16:34,041
Brian.

573
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:34,670
Excited.

574
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,503
It's epic,

575
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,150
but right now he's stuck in traffic so.

576
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,110
So what's up?

577
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,520
This weekend's going to be fun man.

578
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,300
Yeah,

579
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,420
we're going to have great USC and

580
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:44,761
yeah,

581
00:16:44,761 --> 00:16:49,650
this weekend is a chill son and versus
Anderson Silva to the rematch that that

582
00:16:49,651 --> 00:16:50,010
is,

583
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,240
that's going to be scary.

584
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,670
You should stay an extra day
and do the rehab thing with us.

585
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:53,971
Uh,

586
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:54,241
yeah.

587
00:16:54,241 --> 00:16:57,120
Why don't you talk about what you're
doing because I don't know if I will be

588
00:16:57,121 --> 00:16:57,700
able to,

589
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:57,881
uh,

590
00:16:57,881 --> 00:17:00,950
we're in talks right now
and it might start as like,

591
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:01,980
no,

592
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,710
no,

593
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:03,250
it's fine.

594
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:03,761
It's already,

595
00:17:03,761 --> 00:17:05,740
it's already know we already,

596
00:17:05,741 --> 00:17:07,900
we already announced on that by 90 show.

597
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,870
I didn't mean like completely
teased a little bit.

598
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:11,763
Okay.

599
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:12,663
I will look,

600
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:13,780
I uh,

601
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:14,441
yeah,

602
00:17:14,441 --> 00:17:17,830
we're going every Sunday we're going
to start podcasting live from Rehab,

603
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:20,680
which is at the hard rock hotel.

604
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:23,680
And you should say no ring
penicillin with you to Vegas.

605
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,011
No,

606
00:17:24,011 --> 00:17:24,470
I know.

607
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,090
It should bring,

608
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:25,871
I think it's dangerous.

609
00:17:25,871 --> 00:17:26,970
I think I have to really like,

610
00:17:26,971 --> 00:17:29,170
like I'm going to fly in
and do it and fly out.

611
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,610
I totally,

612
00:17:30,611 --> 00:17:32,920
you're totally getting ready
to start doing cocaine.

613
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,320
I'm just going to go all in.

614
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:36,941
Yeah,

615
00:17:36,941 --> 00:17:37,930
you gotta be careful.

616
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:38,711
It's dangerous,

617
00:17:38,711 --> 00:17:39,000
right?

618
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,320
Yeah.

619
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,660
I was carrying your liver,

620
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,321
but it gets the,

621
00:17:41,321 --> 00:17:42,011
the Djs,

622
00:17:42,011 --> 00:17:43,360
the guy from Jersey shore.

623
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,223
Which one?

624
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,491
No,

625
00:17:45,491 --> 00:17:48,560
the one that always has a
really nice hair that you know,

626
00:17:48,561 --> 00:17:49,400
you don't know what I'm about.

627
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:49,861
Like even here,

628
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:49,980
my

629
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,400
dad's Pauly d is the
hair stick straight up?

630
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,283
Is that his name?

631
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,230
He djs,

632
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:55,591
the whole thing.

633
00:17:55,591 --> 00:17:56,760
I met the situation.

634
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:57,151
Yeah,

635
00:17:57,151 --> 00:17:58,240
we were in the sky rise.

636
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,123
Very nice guy.

637
00:17:59,130 --> 00:17:59,821
Very nice guy.

638
00:17:59,821 --> 00:18:00,590
Give me a big hug.

639
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,423
We really friendly.

640
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,550
Not a bad guy at all.

641
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,750
I think it's funny.

642
00:18:03,751 --> 00:18:03,931
He's,

643
00:18:03,931 --> 00:18:04,764
he's trying to,

644
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:06,750
he's trying to make something out of a,

645
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,531
an opportunity,

646
00:18:07,531 --> 00:18:07,741
you know,

647
00:18:07,741 --> 00:18:08,191
came up,

648
00:18:08,191 --> 00:18:08,830
the kid ran with,

649
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:09,930
he's got a great personality.

650
00:18:09,931 --> 00:18:10,764
People like him,

651
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:11,281
you know,

652
00:18:11,281 --> 00:18:12,330
you can make fun of him all day,

653
00:18:12,331 --> 00:18:13,190
but that good,

654
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,140
the kids are making millions of dollars
were shown his ass and he's just

655
00:18:16,141 --> 00:18:16,974
partying.

656
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,270
It's really kind of cute.

657
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,520
He ain't a bad guy,

658
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:21,210
you know,

659
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,320
he ain't a bad guy at all.

660
00:18:22,321 --> 00:18:22,561
I mean,

661
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:26,340
I see him on the show and look
followed me around when I was 21.

662
00:18:26,341 --> 00:18:26,940
You think I was away?

663
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,730
Bigger Douche bag and
that guy and bad guy.

664
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:30,520

667
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:37,651
Yeah.

668
00:18:37,651 --> 00:18:41,310
He's doing a live podcast
type thing or a predict chaos.

669
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,530
Doug Benson the whole weekend,

670
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,710
they'd better not try to smoke weed
out of Doug Bites show at the palace

671
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:47,730
casinos.

672
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:48,090
Right?

673
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:48,251
Yeah.

674
00:18:48,251 --> 00:18:51,330
You've got to be careful
about that because a lot of
people in Vegas or from old

675
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:52,140
school Vegas,

676
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,410
if you ever fear and
loathing in Las Vegas,

677
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:57,150
classic work of my favorite author,

678
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,013
a Hunter Thompson,

679
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,621
and he,

680
00:18:58,621 --> 00:18:58,980
uh,

681
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,090
had that whole thing about,

682
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:03,600
they were on their way to Barstow
when the drugs began to take hold.

683
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:04,950
I mean it's fucking great.

684
00:19:04,951 --> 00:19:09,810
But that Vegas of like fear and everything
was illegal and if you got caught

685
00:19:09,811 --> 00:19:10,261
with pot,

686
00:19:10,261 --> 00:19:11,520
you would do life in jail.

687
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:11,881
Like,

688
00:19:11,881 --> 00:19:13,410
if they pulled you over for pot,

689
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,930
you could do 20 fucking years
and that's not bullshit.

690
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,060
And it's probably a lot of people who did.

691
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,180
Probably a lot of kids who
got high in California,

692
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:24,660
drove on the way to Vegas and got
arrested and spent years in jail.

693
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,710
I mean it's really scary.

694
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,210
It's scary to stop and think about that.

695
00:19:27,211 --> 00:19:30,210
And the people that are
running a lot of those casinos,

696
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:30,961
those guys had been,

697
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:35,820
well I started out in the dunes and 69
and then I moved over to those fucking

698
00:19:35,821 --> 00:19:36,750
old school guys.

699
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,100
They don't fuck around man.

700
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,820
You can't be thinking that you're going
to light up joints and one of those

701
00:19:41,821 --> 00:19:43,050
local casinos,

702
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:44,090
you know?

703
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:44,923
Yeah.

704
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:45,330
Oh No,

705
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,160
you just don't do it.

706
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,010
I mean that's why you just drink heavily
and make really bad decisions and you

707
00:19:50,011 --> 00:19:51,510
don't remember anything
and it stays there.

708
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,550
And it's the palace station.

709
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:53,881
Yeah.

710
00:19:53,881 --> 00:19:56,740
Power stations know those
are all owned by [inaudible].

711
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:57,330
Oh really?

712
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:57,570
Yeah.

713
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:58,520
Well the same guys.

714
00:19:58,521 --> 00:19:59,011
The same guys,

715
00:19:59,011 --> 00:19:59,850
the FERTITTA brothers.

716
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:00,860
Oh Shit.

717
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,590
I should say the Fertitta
brothers owned zoo fun zoo phones.

718
00:20:04,591 --> 00:20:04,981
UFC.

719
00:20:04,981 --> 00:20:06,210
Cause that's actually how it works.

720
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:06,961
But yeah,

721
00:20:06,961 --> 00:20:07,794
they are.

722
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,430
They've got some cash so I could
get good trouble and I'll be safe.

723
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,530
Don't say that.

724
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,010
No,

725
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,830
you might be the exact opposite.

726
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,180
You might be a liability in my dig a
hole for you out there and the fuck I

727
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,440
listen old school,

728
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,303
keep it together.

729
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:23,981
Keep it together,

730
00:20:23,981 --> 00:20:24,141
right.

731
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:24,570
Call.

732
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:24,871
No,

733
00:20:24,871 --> 00:20:25,990
I just don't think they're,

734
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:26,581
Doug should,

735
00:20:26,581 --> 00:20:27,270
uh,

736
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,740
encourage anybody to spark up.

737
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:29,580
I didn't even think of that.

738
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:29,821
Yeah,

739
00:20:29,821 --> 00:20:30,240
I'm not,

740
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,790
I'm going to have to be in watch this
places we can get away with that.

741
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,200
I'm the most places.

742
00:20:34,201 --> 00:20:34,441
No,

743
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,090
especially with Doug knows that like,

744
00:20:36,091 --> 00:20:37,140
I don't think any of you can't,

745
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,970
you can't smoke a cigarette in a theater.

746
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,800
Okay.

747
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,880
And the same reason why
you can't smoke a joint,

748
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,780
because I don't want you
lighting something on fire.

749
00:20:43,781 --> 00:20:44,221
You're stupid.

750
00:20:44,221 --> 00:20:44,491
Fuck,

751
00:20:44,491 --> 00:20:45,324
I don't trust you.

752
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,340
Who knows who's got like pure in there,

753
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:48,731
you know,

754
00:20:48,731 --> 00:20:49,900
they're fucking,

755
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:54,370
they're soda bottle and they spill it and
then someone drops a lighter on it and

756
00:20:54,371 --> 00:20:55,150
we're fuck.

757
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,550
And it was a blazing fire
inside the comedy club.

758
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:57,971
Oh,

759
00:20:57,971 --> 00:20:59,500
you can guarantee you
that's not going to happen.

760
00:20:59,530 --> 00:20:59,681
No,

761
00:20:59,681 --> 00:21:00,341
you can't.

762
00:21:00,341 --> 00:21:03,670
Anything you shouldn't introduce
fire into a room packed with people,

763
00:21:03,671 --> 00:21:04,270
period.

764
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,590
That's why I don't believe in candles.

765
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,360
So I love these little
things that you've done,

766
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,740
these little pods there.

767
00:21:08,741 --> 00:21:13,090
You got some little little sweet jammies
that Brian has and he's got these

768
00:21:13,091 --> 00:21:14,800
little pods all around the,

769
00:21:14,801 --> 00:21:14,981
uh,

770
00:21:14,981 --> 00:21:16,540
the room where they,

771
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:17,374
uh,

772
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:22,100
they recharge their little batteries in
there and they have different colors and

773
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:23,890
they're almost impossible to turn off,

774
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,630
which really frustrates me.

775
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:27,280
How do you look at them to change color?

776
00:21:27,281 --> 00:21:28,270
I'm just moving them around.

777
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:31,010
There's no rhyme or
reason and the directions,

778
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,600
the directions are purposely insane.

779
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,030
Like they don't have anything
to do with the product at all.

780
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:40,390
And I think they just do it to
fuck with you because you're like,

781
00:21:40,391 --> 00:21:41,590
anyone that buys these,

782
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,150
they're just going to trip out anyway.

783
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,860
We got to think who would buy this?

784
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:45,850
If I was the government,

785
00:21:45,851 --> 00:21:47,020
this is exactly what I would do.

786
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:52,320
I would take the first like gps tracking
devices that we distribute out there

787
00:21:53,081 --> 00:21:55,000
into the world and a target stoners.

788
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,230
So lava lamps,

789
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,590
I would arm those and
these fucking silly lights,

790
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,600
I would only go after the stoners.

791
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,100
They need some lava lamp technology.

792
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:06,820
They need to put like LCD
screens inside the lava.

793
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,530
And then so like when
you're watching a lava lamp,

794
00:22:08,531 --> 00:22:10,720
it's just like warp TVs
or something like that.

795
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,141
You know what I mean?

796
00:22:11,141 --> 00:22:15,240
Like what if it was like the liquid
was like a TV screen at a game.

797
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,290
You could have like that technology.

798
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:18,190
That would be annoying.

799
00:22:18,191 --> 00:22:19,024
That'd be weird.

800
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:20,680
But you can have it tuned in to anything.

801
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:20,861
Well,

802
00:22:20,861 --> 00:22:21,191
you know what?

803
00:22:21,191 --> 00:22:21,791
It'd be cool.

804
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:23,440
It'd be cool for a wall effect.

805
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,570
It would be cool if you
projected it on a wall,

806
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:26,771
you know?

807
00:22:26,771 --> 00:22:27,050
And then,

808
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:27,883
you know,

809
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:28,843
yeah.

810
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:30,940
Most like rave clubs.

811
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,793
Well they fake it.

812
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,660
They really present project
an actual lava lamp.

813
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,910
They project a video of a lava lamp.

814
00:22:36,911 --> 00:22:38,620
Perhaps it's all video,

815
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:38,921
you know,

816
00:22:38,921 --> 00:22:39,280
they don't,

817
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,130
they don't actually project
the lava lamp itself.

818
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,620
What exactly?

819
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,420
Have you ever been to that Rehab though?

820
00:22:46,421 --> 00:22:47,680
Have you been to one of those parties?

821
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:48,670
I don't think so.

822
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,890
Maybe long time ago,

823
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,520
maybe.

824
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:51,881
The,

825
00:22:51,881 --> 00:22:52,240
um,

826
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:52,601
those,

827
00:22:52,601 --> 00:22:53,680
those things are fun man.

828
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:58,020
But you can get Sun burnt and you
get fucking drunk out there and uh,

829
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,920
it got to be careful
they'll fall in and drown.

830
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,873
Yeah.

831
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:01,770
Just look at this though.

832
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:02,220
Like I,

833
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:05,200
you gotta wonder how many people are
paying in that water because it's not,

834
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,030
it's not just one.

835
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:07,900
Look at this shit though.

836
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,520
This is like spring break.

837
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:10,730
It's crazy.

838
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:11,230
It's crazy.

839
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,690
And it's just insane.

840
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,290
And Vegas is on another level.

841
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:16,060
It is on another level of democracy.

842
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:22,020
People are just tightly wound and Vegas
is the one place where it's okay to make

843
00:23:22,871 --> 00:23:23,830
out with your girlfriend,

844
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:25,130
you know,

845
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:28,270
and girls start making out with each
other for the first time and look at that.

846
00:23:28,271 --> 00:23:28,931
See right there.

847
00:23:28,931 --> 00:23:30,670
Right on cue.

848
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,023
Was it a shame?

849
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:36,520
Well just you going to get a little of
that now and then while these girls are

850
00:23:36,521 --> 00:23:39,880
grinding on each other and grinding
and that's a podcasting here,

851
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,110
I don't think that would be good.

852
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,280
I don't think those are our people.

853
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:43,850
These.

854
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:48,500
I think the only way they would work is
if everyone here just branched off and

855
00:23:48,501 --> 00:23:50,360
fucked and got this out of your system.

856
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:54,980
There's no way you can put on a podcast
with so much slinging Dick and pussy all

857
00:23:54,981 --> 00:23:56,440
over the place as you look how,

858
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:57,800
who's gonna give a fuck about anything?

859
00:23:57,801 --> 00:23:58,634
We have to say,

860
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,750
you're going to be thinking about,

861
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,370
I can fuck her.

862
00:24:01,371 --> 00:24:02,660
I think she wants to fuck,

863
00:24:02,661 --> 00:24:03,231
and she's like,

864
00:24:03,231 --> 00:24:04,430
I think he's going to fuck me.

865
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,121
Oh my God.

866
00:24:05,121 --> 00:24:06,290
Should I let him fuck me.

867
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,190
And then you're doing shots together.

868
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,230
The next thing you know it,

869
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:10,730
we're floating the river thing.

870
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:11,240
Yeah,

871
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,230
you got to fuck.

872
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,670
Get that shit out of your system.

873
00:24:13,671 --> 00:24:18,671
Then come down and listen to US assholes
rant because you're not going to be

874
00:24:18,801 --> 00:24:19,634
interested.

875
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,350
Why would you be interested in what?

876
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,520
Anything that we have to say.

877
00:24:22,521 --> 00:24:22,760
Well,

878
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,590
there's so much pussy everywhere.

879
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,371
That's insane.

880
00:24:25,371 --> 00:24:25,850
If this,

881
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,110
this is what Arabs hate us,

882
00:24:27,111 --> 00:24:27,770
Bro.

883
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:28,820
Videos like this.

884
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:31,850
Videos like this get out and they don't
even let chicks where they're fucking

885
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,990
regular dresses.

886
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,520
You have to wear burqas and shit.

887
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:35,510
You know,

888
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,590
Islamic fundamentalists,

889
00:24:36,591 --> 00:24:39,560
they look at this as this is the
downfall of western civilization.

890
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,880
This is Babylon to them.

891
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:41,570
You know,

892
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:43,220
of course it's all ridiculous.

893
00:24:43,221 --> 00:24:43,701
And of course,

894
00:24:43,701 --> 00:24:44,534
you know,

895
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,850
completely hypocritical for the most part.

896
00:24:46,851 --> 00:24:47,241
And the guys,

897
00:24:47,241 --> 00:24:52,130
even the guys that were on the planes
that flew into the twin towers,

898
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,740
those guys were at strip clubs
like a couple of nights before.

899
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,660
But this is,

900
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,900
this is what they point to.

901
00:24:57,901 --> 00:25:01,820
If you want to talk to the
decline of Western civilization,

902
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:05,240
they point to all this undisciplined life.

903
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:08,780
What they don't understand is they live
in a place where you have to be strict

904
00:25:08,781 --> 00:25:09,460
and disciplined.

905
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,420
You live in a fucking shitty desert.

906
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:12,320
You know,

907
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,850
if you live in a terrible,

908
00:25:13,851 --> 00:25:16,220
terrible environment and you know,

909
00:25:16,221 --> 00:25:19,160
and everyone is like really
strict and really harsh and mean,

910
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:20,270
that's because the environment,

911
00:25:20,271 --> 00:25:20,931
you live in socks,

912
00:25:20,931 --> 00:25:21,890
no one can relax.

913
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,100
So the only people that survive are the
people that are like super hardcore.

914
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:26,840
If the road ends,

915
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,150
Vegas would be safer than la though,

916
00:25:29,151 --> 00:25:29,984
right?

917
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:30,860
Because I know,

918
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,380
I know there's no water
or anything really there.

919
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:33,811
Oh sure.

920
00:25:33,811 --> 00:25:34,880
It was lake mead.

921
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:35,750
Oh,

922
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:36,710
there's a big lake there.

923
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,420
I think it's a fake lake though.

924
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,160
I don't know if it's an artificial lake.

925
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,350
I don't think it might have been
built by a dam or something like that.

926
00:25:42,351 --> 00:25:43,100
But it's there.

927
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:43,670
Right,

928
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:46,130
and it's awesome and they
have a striped bass in there.

929
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:47,180
You could go fishing in there.

930
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:48,771
But yeah,

931
00:25:48,771 --> 00:25:51,290
I think Vegas is probably safer than La.

932
00:25:51,291 --> 00:25:53,690
I don't think they would if
they were attacking America,

933
00:25:53,691 --> 00:25:56,270
they want attack our banking system.

934
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,220
If someone was trying to be a terrorist,

935
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,830
they would try to attack
massive population centers.

936
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,360
Vegas for all its craziness,

937
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:04,070
doesn't really have that
many people live in there.

938
00:26:04,071 --> 00:26:05,270
It's fairly small town.

939
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,740
It'd be easy to escape.

940
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:07,420
Well,

941
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,660
just once,

942
00:26:08,661 --> 00:26:09,800
if the shit hits the fan,

943
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,500
the resources are going
to run dry really quick.

944
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,180
You're not going to be
able to bring in any food.

945
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,140
And then it's like,

946
00:26:15,141 --> 00:26:16,640
what are you eating when you eat?

947
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:17,421
There's nothing there.

948
00:26:17,421 --> 00:26:18,231
And it's going to be like,

949
00:26:18,231 --> 00:26:19,100
it really should be,

950
00:26:19,101 --> 00:26:20,380
which is a desert and not,

951
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:22,490
I'm not saying there's anything
wrong with living in the desert,

952
00:26:22,491 --> 00:26:26,150
it's just the only way to live in the
desert today and this and this world is

953
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:28,520
you have to have modern power.

954
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,690
You have to have food,

955
00:26:29,691 --> 00:26:30,830
you have to have supermarkets.

956
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:34,880
You have to be able to get water that
that has to come to you if you live in the

957
00:26:34,881 --> 00:26:36,740
desert because it was just
you live in the desert,

958
00:26:36,741 --> 00:26:37,574
you're kind of fucked.

959
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,050
There's no food out there.

960
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,280
How are you going to grow food?

961
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:40,940
You can't eat,

962
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:41,601
there's no water.

963
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:42,140
You know what I'm saying?

964
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,650
Unless you're bringing in,

965
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,240
you can't really live in the desert.

966
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:50,190
So the only way to live in the desert
is with modern means and when the shit

967
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,024
hits the fan,

968
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,530
if you're living in the desert,

969
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,170
those modern means would be useless and
then you've got to get the fuck out of

970
00:26:55,171 --> 00:26:55,591
the desert.

971
00:26:55,591 --> 00:26:56,424
So probably the most,

972
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:57,900
probably the best places.

973
00:26:57,901 --> 00:26:58,950
Then it would be something like,

974
00:26:59,070 --> 00:26:59,903
you know,

975
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:01,800
yeah,

976
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,520
not bad,

977
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,061
not bad,

978
00:27:03,061 --> 00:27:04,260
but the winter is a problem.

979
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,060
Transportation is a real cunt.

980
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,160
You know you're going to ride
horses back and forth everywhere.

981
00:27:08,161 --> 00:27:10,830
That's the only way to get around and
you don't want to go too far on a fucking

982
00:27:10,831 --> 00:27:11,610
horse.

983
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:12,690
You know you don't want to do that.

984
00:27:12,691 --> 00:27:13,530
You don't want to go too far.

985
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:14,670
If you have to drag shit,

986
00:27:14,671 --> 00:27:16,410
if the horses have to
drag lumber and stuff,

987
00:27:16,411 --> 00:27:17,070
you're going to be,

988
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:19,680
you're going to want to be as
self sustaining as possible,

989
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,740
but we'll have dogs and I
will have it slaves and dogs,

990
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,551
they'll be like that.

991
00:27:23,551 --> 00:27:24,890
Say it doesn't get that snow.

992
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,760
You can count on it to be that snowy.

993
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,013
It's ridiculous.

994
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,880
It doesn't make any sense.

995
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,940
Like reindeers just tons of chick.

996
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:33,450
All those Chihuahuas,

997
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,480
they will all be put to use as horses now.

998
00:27:35,481 --> 00:27:36,150
They would be trained,

999
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:39,270
they trample on each other and we would
hate them if we find out how mean they

1000
00:27:39,271 --> 00:27:42,390
really are the deep biting the ones
underneath them as they're trying to pull

1001
00:27:42,391 --> 00:27:43,224
your sled.

1002
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:46,560
I was watching old looney tunes this
weekend cause this guy named fast.

1003
00:27:46,561 --> 00:27:47,410
Eddie told me that.

1004
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:48,091
He's like,

1005
00:27:48,091 --> 00:27:48,140
Hey,

1006
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:48,571
do you remember,

1007
00:27:48,571 --> 00:27:48,991
wait a minute,

1008
00:27:48,991 --> 00:27:49,381
wait a minute,

1009
00:27:49,381 --> 00:27:49,770
wait a minute.

1010
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:50,071
Wait a minute.

1011
00:27:50,071 --> 00:27:51,390
You know a dude named faceting,

1012
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,070
has he tried to take
his dick in your mouth?

1013
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:53,550
No,

1014
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:53,940
not yet.

1015
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:54,720
No.

1016
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,210
I don't know if that's,

1017
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:57,870
this is the guy makes
you call them fast Eddie.

1018
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,460
Which my name Beth Daddy.

1019
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,440
They call me fast at this one.

1020
00:28:01,441 --> 00:28:03,870
Fast Eddie or right and it's fast.

1021
00:28:03,871 --> 00:28:06,270
Eddie fell sin from the fucking hustler.

1022
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:08,730
It's Paul fucking Newman.

1023
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,953
That's who it was.

1024
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,800
The guy that originally.

1025
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,271
That's fast.

1026
00:28:12,271 --> 00:28:12,511
Eddie.

1027
00:28:12,511 --> 00:28:13,830
You can't call yourself fast setting.

1028
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,520
That's completely,

1029
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,720
he's a guy from the comedy store.

1030
00:28:15,721 --> 00:28:18,480
Do you know who a Hispanic guy?

1031
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:19,170
No,

1032
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,470
but he can't call himself fast.

1033
00:28:20,471 --> 00:28:23,460
That if somebody else wants
to call caused himself.

1034
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,061
First of all,

1035
00:28:24,061 --> 00:28:25,080
you better be able to play pool.

1036
00:28:25,081 --> 00:28:25,530
Bitch.

1037
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:26,520
You want to call yourself fast?

1038
00:28:26,521 --> 00:28:27,360
I don't think he calls himself.

1039
00:28:27,361 --> 00:28:28,194
I think other people can,

1040
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:31,040
but they better stop this one fast.

1041
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,711
Eddie fast.

1042
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:32,544
Eddie fell son.

1043
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,510
What was I talking about?

1044
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,140
Paul Newman.

1045
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:34,681
The Hustler.

1046
00:28:34,681 --> 00:28:35,670
Jackie Gleason.

1047
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,380
Now that's what you're talking about,

1048
00:28:37,381 --> 00:28:37,561
bitch.

1049
00:28:37,561 --> 00:28:37,921
I wonder.

1050
00:28:37,921 --> 00:28:39,210
I think it was 63,

1051
00:28:39,211 --> 00:28:40,350
I don't remember what year it was,

1052
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,060
somewhere in 1960s,

1053
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,051
early sixties.

1054
00:28:43,051 --> 00:28:43,621
But God,

1055
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:44,550
what a movie man.

1056
00:28:44,551 --> 00:28:45,990
What a great fucking movie.

1057
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,790
And if you're a pool player that's like,

1058
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:51,570
you know that movies like
the holy grail of movies.

1059
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,920
This is the holy grail of pool movies
cause it was like a really good dramatic

1060
00:28:55,921 --> 00:28:59,610
film and it captured this guy's
obsession to be the best pool player.

1061
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,290
Although quite honestly,

1062
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:04,560
Paul Newman really does not
have a very believable stroke.

1063
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:07,290
He needed to stay down on
the ball a little bit more.

1064
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:09,960
His fall through it was
a little ham fisted,

1065
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,300
whereas Jackie Gleason had a real stroke.

1066
00:29:12,301 --> 00:29:14,160
Jackie Gleason could
actually run a hundred balls,

1067
00:29:14,161 --> 00:29:14,630
I believe.

1068
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,950
I believe you at least ran 75 balls.

1069
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:17,540
Uh,

1070
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,510
he was a real player.

1071
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:21,540
You could tell by the way he
would a pocket balls like he was.

1072
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:22,853
He was,

1073
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:24,640
he grew up on pool tables here.

1074
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,590
Andy Griffin died today.

1075
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,400
Andy Griffin from the Andy Griffith show.

1076
00:29:27,401 --> 00:29:27,870
Yeah.

1077
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:28,890
Oh that sucks.

1078
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:29,881
It does suck.

1079
00:29:29,881 --> 00:29:30,600
That's like one of those.

1080
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,940
Aw Yeah.

1081
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:32,280
Yeah.

1082
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:32,491
Wouldn't.

1083
00:29:32,491 --> 00:29:34,830
Nobody hated that guy is fucking nice guy.

1084
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:38,910
He's already buried that he'd died
today and he's already buried.

1085
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:39,720
Wow.

1086
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,040
Because he wanted an immediate burial.

1087
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:42,221
Oh,

1088
00:29:42,221 --> 00:29:44,170
he probably didn't want to
be embalmed or something.

1089
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:44,440
Yeah.

1090
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,161
Is that possible?

1091
00:29:45,161 --> 00:29:46,820
Can you say that you're wanting to bond?

1092
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:48,640
Just put a bunch of craziness.

1093
00:29:48,641 --> 00:29:50,710
Is this the universe eats our bodies.

1094
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,071
All right.

1095
00:29:51,071 --> 00:29:51,881
That's just the way it is.

1096
00:29:51,881 --> 00:29:52,541
It's set up.

1097
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,430
There's a bunch of shit inside the soil.

1098
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,200
The soil is not just dirt.

1099
00:29:56,201 --> 00:29:57,130
Soil is alive.

1100
00:29:57,131 --> 00:29:58,120
It's alive with minerals.

1101
00:29:58,121 --> 00:29:59,250
It's alive with organisms.

1102
00:29:59,260 --> 00:29:59,811
Just attention is it?

1103
00:29:59,811 --> 00:30:03,520
The 10 people acts as a bunch of shit
in there that would eat your body and

1104
00:30:03,521 --> 00:30:06,070
that's what it's supposed to
do and you poison that stuff.

1105
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:06,491
You know,

1106
00:30:06,491 --> 00:30:08,800
poisoned your bodies and
then cover them with makeup.

1107
00:30:08,801 --> 00:30:09,151
So what?

1108
00:30:09,151 --> 00:30:10,080
So people can stare.

1109
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,230
Number 10 you're not dead.

1110
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:14,170
Why do you have a dead person
with fucking makeup on?

1111
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:19,320
Lying in a bed with a rosary wrapped
around their frozen frigid hands.

1112
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:20,410
Just bury them.

1113
00:30:20,411 --> 00:30:21,760
This is craziness.

1114
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,400
Staring at a body doesn't
do anybody any good.

1115
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:26,710
What if we totally missed guests?

1116
00:30:26,711 --> 00:30:27,640
Like how old they are,

1117
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:30,340
the planet is and that actually every,

1118
00:30:30,341 --> 00:30:34,120
all the dirt is just tons of tons of dead
people from like billions and billions

1119
00:30:34,121 --> 00:30:34,780
of years.

1120
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:37,140
And like in the middle there just one
person and that's God and he's just

1121
00:30:37,141 --> 00:30:37,661
sitting there like,

1122
00:30:37,661 --> 00:30:38,830
I'm like in the middle of nowhere.

1123
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,490
Well that's,

1124
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:39,791
you know,

1125
00:30:39,791 --> 00:30:41,920
that's kind of funny because
that's what like some,

1126
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:45,380
there's some beaches that
are covered in fish bones.

1127
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,990
Like the sand is actually like fish bones,

1128
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:48,611
like,

1129
00:30:48,611 --> 00:30:49,000
um,

1130
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,800
where they have big die offs.

1131
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:53,030
Like what does that solve the seat?

1132
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:53,350
Yes,

1133
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:53,921
the salt and sea.

1134
00:30:53,921 --> 00:30:54,670
Exactly.

1135
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:55,720
There's areas I haven't,

1136
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,100
you gone personally,

1137
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,280
I don't want to go to that shit.

1138
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,560
We talked about doing a podcast.

1139
00:30:59,561 --> 00:30:59,891
There are whites,

1140
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,080
but we like sobered up.

1141
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:04,360
I've talked to so many
people since then that,

1142
00:31:04,361 --> 00:31:06,040
cause now that I know what
it is that talk about it,

1143
00:31:06,041 --> 00:31:06,191
like,

1144
00:31:06,191 --> 00:31:07,024
oh I went there.

1145
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:07,873
What was it like?

1146
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,430
It's,

1147
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,310
it's stinks.

1148
00:31:09,311 --> 00:31:09,660
It's,

1149
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,990
I don't know if I recommend it.

1150
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:11,591
It's all right.

1151
00:31:11,591 --> 00:31:12,370
It's kind of weird,

1152
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,060
but it's,

1153
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:13,241
I mean,

1154
00:31:13,241 --> 00:31:15,100
it was a pretty miserable
day and I'm like,

1155
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:15,311
oh,

1156
00:31:15,311 --> 00:31:15,750
I don't,

1157
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:16,583
I just sound good.

1158
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:17,220
Well,

1159
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,050
yeah.

1160
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:18,670
Well,

1161
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:19,810
if you don't know what it is,

1162
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:22,600
there's some fucking
amazing documentary on it.

1163
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,733
It was that who?

1164
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,573
Who made that?

1165
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:25,300
What is it?

1166
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:25,960
The trial?

1167
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,793
Something.

1168
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:28,570
Something in pleasures
of the salt and sea.

1169
00:31:28,571 --> 00:31:29,830
Do you remember the
name of the documentary?

1170
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:31,440
Dammit.

1171
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:31,870
I'm going to,

1172
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:33,760
I'm going to have to
look it up because it's,

1173
00:31:33,761 --> 00:31:34,001
it's,

1174
00:31:34,001 --> 00:31:39,001
it's really a fascinating documentary
and it was a all showing how it used to

1175
00:31:39,101 --> 00:31:39,750
be.

1176
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:43,060
It used to be like this amazing
resort town or you're binging it.

1177
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:43,881
No,

1178
00:31:43,881 --> 00:31:46,390
I'm googling it to see that.

1179
00:31:46,391 --> 00:31:46,920
Google,

1180
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,531
that picture,

1181
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:48,251
that Google car,

1182
00:31:48,251 --> 00:31:49,270
the guy in a car accident,

1183
00:31:49,271 --> 00:31:49,920
one of the,

1184
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,260
hey,

1185
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,031
I want to tell you something.

1186
00:31:51,031 --> 00:31:51,180
No,

1187
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:51,431
man,

1188
00:31:51,431 --> 00:31:53,640
when you just before you
change the subject on that,

1189
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,850
that binging thing,

1190
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,340
I tried googling something
and it banged me.

1191
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:58,190
Oh,

1192
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,023
on your laptop.

1193
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:04,910
I wrote Google and I did a Google search
and through some Microsoft fuckery it

1194
00:32:05,561 --> 00:32:07,000
became a bing search.

1195
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,200
It was not,

1196
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,340
I did not do that though.

1197
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:10,960
I did not turn it into a bing search.

1198
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,340
It became a bing search.

1199
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,151
I was like,

1200
00:32:13,151 --> 00:32:13,511
wow.

1201
00:32:13,511 --> 00:32:14,620
I don't think I liked that.

1202
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,940
I think that's Kinda creepy.

1203
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:16,540
Something.

1204
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,610
Even if it's just a,

1205
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:18,041
I mean,

1206
00:32:18,041 --> 00:32:18,310
that's,

1207
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:18,641
that's,

1208
00:32:18,641 --> 00:32:19,510
that's fuckery.

1209
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:19,850
Yeah.

1210
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,160
Microsoft's tricky like that,

1211
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,870
but that's an immediate fuckery.

1212
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:24,340
I've had this thing for two weeks.

1213
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:25,690
That kind of shit creeps me out.

1214
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:26,260
Yeah.

1215
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:26,591
You know,

1216
00:32:26,591 --> 00:32:27,281
let me Google it,

1217
00:32:27,281 --> 00:32:27,580
bitch.

1218
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,230
Why you so scared you'll,

1219
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,201
you'll forget about it though.

1220
00:32:30,201 --> 00:32:32,020
You'll be bringing your son
getting pinged all the time.

1221
00:32:32,021 --> 00:32:33,150
You won't even realize they don't care.

1222
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:34,540
Fuck was I Google searching dude,

1223
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,230
uh,

1224
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:39,620
how to come down from really high.

1225
00:32:39,621 --> 00:32:40,730
We'd quickly,

1226
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:45,980
why aren't you telling me to go
that the documentary on the Oh yeah.

1227
00:32:45,981 --> 00:32:46,910
Salt and say Jesus.

1228
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,833
I see

1229
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,473
Jesus.

1230
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:51,843
Okay.

1231
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:52,640
John.

1232
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,150
I think it's John Waters.

1233
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:56,963
Okay.

1234
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,130
John Waters.

1235
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,033
Oh,

1236
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:02,390
he,

1237
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:05,130
he just loves documentaries about this.

1238
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,620
Hydration's no,

1239
00:33:07,621 --> 00:33:07,801
it's,

1240
00:33:07,801 --> 00:33:08,071
it's,

1241
00:33:08,071 --> 00:33:09,310
it's more of a pl.

1242
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:09,871
That's it.

1243
00:33:09,871 --> 00:33:12,180
Plagues and pleasures of the salt and sea.

1244
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,590
That's the documentary and the,

1245
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,031
it's,

1246
00:33:15,031 --> 00:33:15,540
um,

1247
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,380
it's really,

1248
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,130
uh,

1249
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:18,300
a special documentary.

1250
00:33:18,301 --> 00:33:23,301
It's really interesting because this
area in our lifetime went from being this

1251
00:33:24,601 --> 00:33:29,601
amazing resort were everybody went
to party to being a complete mess.

1252
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,870
Everybody moved out.

1253
00:33:31,871 --> 00:33:33,270
It looks like the apocalypse man.

1254
00:33:33,271 --> 00:33:34,740
The video is insane.

1255
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,600
Like when you look at
what it used to be like,

1256
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,710
everybody was like driving around there,

1257
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:42,960
their motorboats and catching fish and
they were all drinking and partying.

1258
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:46,170
It was like some crazy like resort.

1259
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:50,520
We're like Sonny Bono grew up and he was
a part of this big movement to try to

1260
00:33:50,521 --> 00:33:54,240
bring it back and then you see what it
became and you realize that that can

1261
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:57,630
happen inside our lifetime
from fucking Sonny Bono.

1262
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:59,790
The Sonny and Cher show
was on when I was a kid.

1263
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:03,270
I remember when Sonny Bono died when
he went skiing into a fucking tray.

1264
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,201
I was sad.

1265
00:34:04,201 --> 00:34:05,940
Sonny Bono seemed like a nice guy,

1266
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,290
and from that era,

1267
00:34:07,291 --> 00:34:09,840
from his life till now apocalypse,

1268
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:12,390
the whole thing is just dead fish.

1269
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:16,560
So much dead fish that the sand is bones.

1270
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:17,380
There's a,

1271
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:17,850
there's a,

1272
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:18,280
uh,

1273
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,350
a boney,

1274
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,970
crunchy sand.

1275
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,970
The whole place just stinks of dead death.

1276
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,080
They have massive,

1277
00:34:25,081 --> 00:34:27,870
massive fish die offs were
like a million fish will die.

1278
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:28,350
Yeah.

1279
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:29,183
And they just,

1280
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:31,500
they flood like the inland areas.

1281
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:34,140
So like all the boats of
rotten fish around them.

1282
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:36,030
I wonder if it's like a
bucket of dead pussies,

1283
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:36,451
you know,

1284
00:34:36,451 --> 00:34:37,710
like just like that bad.

1285
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:38,491
Or if it's just like,

1286
00:34:38,491 --> 00:34:38,731
you know,

1287
00:34:38,731 --> 00:34:39,451
like fishy,

1288
00:34:39,451 --> 00:34:40,000
bad,

1289
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,670
you know,

1290
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:43,140
death is probably the most
depressing smell ever.

1291
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:46,110
I don't think you could be happy
smelling a million dead fish.

1292
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:49,590
It's like nature's letting you
know there's a terrible thing here.

1293
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:50,250
This is what,

1294
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:51,540
whatever's going on here.

1295
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,560
This is terrible.

1296
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:57,780
It's led us a million organisms
to shit out and just stop existing

1297
00:34:57,810 --> 00:34:58,830
instantaneously.

1298
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,053
That's not good.

1299
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:00,600
Yeah.

1300
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,433
But it looks,

1301
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,850
it looks like it used to be awesome.

1302
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:03,150
It's,

1303
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,200
it's crazy to watch.

1304
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:07,770
It looks like it used to be this bad ass
place and everybody would go to and you

1305
00:35:07,771 --> 00:35:07,921
know,

1306
00:35:07,921 --> 00:35:12,420
you'd go to get your party on w and in
our lifetime it's become a nightmare.

1307
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,980
And in this documentary though,

1308
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:15,400
some dudes sates,

1309
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:16,950
not some dude say it's all hype.

1310
00:35:16,951 --> 00:35:19,770
And one guy was in the documentary
that actually eats the fish.

1311
00:35:19,771 --> 00:35:21,270
He eats it like Sashimi.

1312
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,320
He doesn't even cook it.

1313
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,670
It just filets it.

1314
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:24,511
And I was like,

1315
00:35:24,511 --> 00:35:25,344
wow.

1316
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:28,800
But maybe as bodies just like
so used to that maybe he's like,

1317
00:35:28,801 --> 00:35:29,461
while he's doing that,

1318
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:31,710
he's got three cigarettes in
his mouth at the same time,

1319
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:34,260
he doesn't give a fuck about
some fucking pollution.

1320
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,130
Right.

1321
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:35,880
You know,

1322
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,940
I mean if you really think about what if
you're a cigarette smoker should be you

1323
00:35:38,941 --> 00:35:40,520
be even concerned about pollution.

1324
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:45,270
There's no way it could be possibly
as bad as shit your self inflicting.

1325
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:45,740
Alright,

1326
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,970
you're voluntarily pumping
that shit in your system.

1327
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,950
Eat some dirty Shashimi
what are you worried about?

1328
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:54,180
I'm thinking I'm done with Sushi
and just don't be getting sick.

1329
00:35:54,181 --> 00:35:57,330
That last time really
scared me out away from it.

1330
00:35:57,331 --> 00:36:00,960
I think you can really fuck your system
up if you get a parasite and they say

1331
00:36:00,961 --> 00:36:02,430
that if you want to be really careful,

1332
00:36:02,431 --> 00:36:04,470
you should only eat salt water Sushi.

1333
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:06,210
You should only eat like tuna.

1334
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:09,330
And you've gotta be careful
with freshwater stuff
cause freshwater stuff can

1335
00:36:09,331 --> 00:36:10,500
contain parasites.

1336
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:11,440
And,

1337
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,273
uh,

1338
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,110
yes,

1339
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:15,480
you really should cook a
lot of freshwater fishes.

1340
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,160
Yeah.

1341
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,030
There's certain fish that have parasites,

1342
00:36:18,031 --> 00:36:18,560
like salmon,

1343
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,440
have parasites.

1344
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:20,041
You have,

1345
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:22,020
you have to be careful and you can get,

1346
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:22,801
you can get sick,

1347
00:36:22,801 --> 00:36:23,260
man.

1348
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:23,700
You can,

1349
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:23,940
you're,

1350
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,390
you know,

1351
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,100
you could fuck up your digestive tract,

1352
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:28,123
you know,

1353
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:28,860
and you can,

1354
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:32,160
it's just not good to have little
fucking parasites inside your body.

1355
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,360
Contouring it up.

1356
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:34,950
You've really got to see Ted Mann.

1357
00:36:34,951 --> 00:36:35,880
That was a really,

1358
00:36:35,881 --> 00:36:37,170
really good fun movie.

1359
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,760
And if you're like family guy,

1360
00:36:38,761 --> 00:36:39,150
it's just,

1361
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:40,230
it feels good.

1362
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:40,710
It,

1363
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:43,290
I like how you used a lot of
the characters in family guy,

1364
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:44,430
but the actor parts,

1365
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:44,731
you know,

1366
00:36:44,731 --> 00:36:45,570
like they're real,

1367
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,060
they're real people or
actors in the movie.

1368
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,830
So everything just feels comfortable.

1369
00:36:49,831 --> 00:36:50,371
It's funny,

1370
00:36:50,371 --> 00:36:53,400
there's a lot of drug use
like mushrooms and weed in it.

1371
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:53,821
You know,

1372
00:36:53,821 --> 00:36:55,260
when I heard that that movie did good,

1373
00:36:55,261 --> 00:36:55,500
I was,

1374
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,340
I felt like,

1375
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:56,510
uh,

1376
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:56,950
like a,

1377
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,660
a good guy one.

1378
00:36:58,670 --> 00:36:59,070
Yeah.

1379
00:36:59,070 --> 00:36:59,670
You know what I mean?

1380
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:00,900
Like Seth Macfarlane is,

1381
00:37:00,901 --> 00:37:01,230
uh,

1382
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,100
I only met him once.

1383
00:37:02,101 --> 00:37:03,660
I did a an episode of,

1384
00:37:03,661 --> 00:37:04,494
uh,

1385
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:07,140
I think that someone was on fear factor
or something like that on a show.

1386
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:10,620
And I did it on a [inaudible] and then
they made fun of me and American Dad too,

1387
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:11,483
so that was kind of cool.

1388
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,220
I want to,

1389
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,820
but I haven't tweaked people tweet to
get them on a podcast or something.

1390
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:19,350
I'm sure he's busy as fuck now that it's
movies gigantic now his movie took off,

1391
00:37:19,351 --> 00:37:19,740
but,

1392
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,720
but he's just a genuinely nice dude.

1393
00:37:21,721 --> 00:37:22,291
Like when I met him,

1394
00:37:22,291 --> 00:37:22,981
he was like genuine.

1395
00:37:22,981 --> 00:37:24,270
Like you can tell when someone's like,

1396
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:25,650
here's a genuine smile,

1397
00:37:25,651 --> 00:37:26,580
like a friendly dude.

1398
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,110
So it's nice when you know,

1399
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,250
you find out he's doing well,

1400
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:33,270
but don't tell fucking Delta of
south park guys hate him now.

1401
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:33,920
I don't know.

1402
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,770
They shit on him.

1403
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,633
I think it's just,

1404
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,290
they're just getting out competitive.

1405
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:38,041
Is that what it is?

1406
00:37:38,041 --> 00:37:38,670
I don't know.

1407
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:39,600
I don't think they hate him.

1408
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:40,680
Yeah,

1409
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,250
I dunno.

1410
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,890
Who knows Matt stone and Trey Parker.

1411
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:44,490
I mean,

1412
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:45,480
especially Trey Parker,

1413
00:37:45,481 --> 00:37:49,890
he's such a fucking genius that it's like
you gotta like let them go nutty every

1414
00:37:49,891 --> 00:37:50,311
now and then.

1415
00:37:50,311 --> 00:37:50,761
On things.

1416
00:37:50,761 --> 00:37:51,420
It's just,

1417
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,800
it comes with the program like you,

1418
00:37:52,801 --> 00:37:53,280
you don't,

1419
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,113
you don't,

1420
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:55,230
you know this,

1421
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,100
he's,

1422
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:59,790
he's out there like
for how many years now?

1423
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:05,060
Putting out the edgiest 70 most bad ass
cartoon in the history of the world.

1424
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:06,450
I mean,

1425
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:06,991
family guys.

1426
00:38:06,991 --> 00:38:08,060
A nice cartoon.

1427
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:08,281
It's a,

1428
00:38:08,281 --> 00:38:10,050
it's a fun show and I do owe you.

1429
00:38:10,051 --> 00:38:10,560
All right.

1430
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,550
Holy Shit.

1431
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,230
That was crazy.

1432
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:13,741
Dude.

1433
00:38:13,741 --> 00:38:14,880
You got a short somewhere.

1434
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,260
We should shut this thing down.

1435
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:17,940
Oh yeah.

1436
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,440
You gotta stop licking the microphone.

1437
00:38:19,441 --> 00:38:19,920
You Fuck,

1438
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,780
I've shorted everything.

1439
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:21,751
It's from you.

1440
00:38:21,751 --> 00:38:22,584
Drool and Bro,

1441
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,553
that's what it is.

1442
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:26,670
You want to kill the podcast and
try to figure out what's going on.

1443
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:28,590
Sparked my face.

1444
00:38:28,591 --> 00:38:29,424
Did you see the spark,

1445
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:30,570
ladies and gentlemen,

1446
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:32,970
this day seems to be cursed.

1447
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:33,990
Uh,

1448
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:37,480
I'm glad that the podcast started at
least a little late because we would have

1449
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,340
been stumbling idiots.

1450
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:42,850
We got ahold of some pot
that is from another planet,

1451
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:44,200
as Joey Diaz would say,

1452
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:47,500
is they shit they gave Kennedy before
they took the top off the convertible.

1453
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:48,740
Wow.

1454
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:49,420
You're right.

1455
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,253
Are you going to die?

1456
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:54,400
It's sparked like light just
to the podcast from over there.

1457
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:55,263
You'll be good.

1458
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:55,690
Yeah,

1459
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:58,540
we have a serious shortage
and throw some water on.

1460
00:38:58,541 --> 00:38:59,374
It will be fine.

1461
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,750
That was a white lightning bolt,

1462
00:39:01,751 --> 00:39:02,560
bolt spark.

1463
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,490
That's God.

1464
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,240
Or Fuck,

1465
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:04,750
you've been,

1466
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:06,700
you've been taught that
God for your whole life.

1467
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:08,750
God is upset.

1468
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,451
God's upset with you,

1469
00:39:10,451 --> 00:39:11,284
Brian.

1470
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,400
All right folks,

1471
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,990
we're going to have to
figure out what this is.

1472
00:39:13,991 --> 00:39:18,730
So Brian doesn't die and we don't want
Josh Barnett to have a flat tire and then

1473
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:19,564
get electrocuted.

1474
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,430
That shit would be ridiculous.

1475
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:24,880
So we're going to figure
out what's going on.

1476
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:25,930
Hopefully,

1477
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,930
and we'll be back in
about 10 to 15 minutes.

1478
00:39:28,931 --> 00:39:31,630
Is that that probably a accurate,

1479
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,700
that was a lightening bolt.

1480
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:35,500
It's got to walk it off auto.

1481
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:36,383
I'm going to walk it off.

1482
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:37,451
10 15 minutes.

1483
00:39:37,451 --> 00:39:38,500
We'll see you guys a little bit.

1484
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:38,831
Thank you.

1485
00:39:38,831 --> 00:39:39,070
Bye.
