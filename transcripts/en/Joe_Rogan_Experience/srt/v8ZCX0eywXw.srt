1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,320
Four,
three,

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:05,700
two,
one.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,850
And we're live.
How are you chuck?

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,830
I am great.
Look at this place.

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,390
Thanks for being here,
man.

6
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:13,530
I appreciate it.
Thank you.

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,810
I've read your books.
I've,

8
00:00:14,811 --> 00:00:15,644
I've watched movies based on your book,
so it's very cool to meet you in real 

9
00:00:18,241 --> 00:00:19,074
life and it's always a disappointment.
It is always so heartbreaking because 

10
00:00:23,551 --> 00:00:25,680
people expect somebody,
uh,

11
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,600
somebody,
so not me.

12
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,870
And I'm constantly breaking their heart 
when they meet me.

13
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,123
Well,
I expect you so you're not breaking my 

14
00:00:34,621 --> 00:00:36,420
heart at all.
I'm very pleased to meet you.

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,433
So I didn't have any Weirdo expectations
or any delusions of who you are and 

16
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:42,831
don't just,
just,

17
00:00:42,831 --> 00:00:44,250
just don't,
don't kill yourself.

18
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:47,080
Okay.
I mean,

19
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:50,190
Anthony Bordain and he kills himself.
Well,

20
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,290
I think there was a lot of other factors
involved there.

21
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:53,540
I'm not,
I don't know.

22
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,630
I see this so many of my peers is like 
that at the moment.

23
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:58,800
I meet them.
Boom,

24
00:00:58,801 --> 00:00:59,970
they're gone.
Um,

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,833
yeah.
I'm,

26
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,280
I'm not gonna do that.
Okay.

27
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,930
So don't worry.
Everything's fine.

28
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,820
Um,
listen,

29
00:01:05,821 --> 00:01:07,050
I want to talk to you about a bunch of 
things.

30
00:01:07,051 --> 00:01:07,970
First of all,
uh,

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,040
I would love to talk to you about your 
writing process because one of the,

32
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,720
one of the things that I've read once 
is,

33
00:01:12,721 --> 00:01:16,290
uh,
I believe you were writing down,

34
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,750
it was on the Cape,
is in Massachusetts.

35
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,423
We ever writing down there,
we have a writing somewhere where you 

36
00:01:22,711 --> 00:01:23,544
made a deal with yourself where you 
wouldn't turn the heat on unless you 

37
00:01:25,861 --> 00:01:27,120
were writing.
Oh my gosh.

38
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:30,320
Do you think I'm a white person?
Don't you feel weird?

39
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,860
The Cape,
the Cape?

40
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,040
He never been to the Cape Cod.
That's like an angel white people that's

41
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:35,970
in England,
New England,

42
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,200
New England.
Yes.

43
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,093
No,
I never read anything like that about 

44
00:01:39,421 --> 00:01:40,260
you.
No,

45
00:01:40,261 --> 00:01:41,094
I'm sorry.

46
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,580
Never been on the Cape.
He never been to Cape Cod.

47
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,330
Never had a person.
She seems wonderful.

48
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:49,960
What's wrong?
A class?

49
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:50,780
No,
no,

50
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,300
no,
no.

51
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,133
It's just something.
Maybe it's something that I attributed 

52
00:01:54,391 --> 00:01:56,190
to for many,
many years,

53
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,263
but it's just an interesting story that 
someone said that they were forcing 

54
00:01:59,341 --> 00:02:01,800
themselves to be disciplined writing and
so they wouldn't,

55
00:02:01,801 --> 00:02:02,910
right.
Unless they have the heat on.

56
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,790
And so they,
they lived in this place,

57
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,230
uh,
over the winter.

58
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,273
God wasn't you,
you were talking about Michael 

59
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,730
Cunningham.
Is that who was yeah,

60
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:13,000
because he uh,
yeah,

61
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,420
I think that's his story about living in
province town.

62
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,040
Might've been fuck this all up,
but terrible way to get going.

63
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,850
I'm the one thing I wanted to talk to 
you though being much lately.

64
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,860
No,
I don't any at all.

65
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,680
I just sleep.
I'm fortunate in that regard.

66
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,750
All right.
You don't take that shit to you?

67
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,430
Of course I do.
Do you?

68
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,660
Yeah,
three times a day.

69
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,580
Uh,
you're fucking with me.

70
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:40,650
We've got it.
We got started off poorly with me once a

71
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:42,420
day.
Do you really take ambien?

72
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,201
Yeah.
You know what,

73
00:02:43,201 --> 00:02:47,100
to tell the truth just before I want to 
do anything I don't want to do.

74
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:51,120
It's like a sh elves in the shoemaker 
thing is I don't want to do my taxes.

75
00:02:51,121 --> 00:02:54,540
So I take ambien and then I wake up and 
my taxes are done.

76
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,703
Ah,
and do you have plausible deniability 

77
00:02:57,661 --> 00:02:59,100
too?
If you can get videotape,

78
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,043
you take an ambien.
People have committed murder on ambien 

79
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,990
and gotten off because they had no 
memory.

80
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,820
That is true.
Yeah,

81
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:07,654
it's a hypnotic,
we actually did a pretty in depth 

82
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:14,760
discussion about that after the Roseanne
Barr thing came out.

83
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,660
My own mom,
uh,

84
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,613
has taken and she stopped taking it,
but one of the reasons why I stopped 

85
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:21,470
taking it because she woke up in the 
middle of the night and uh,

86
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:26,550
she had a white bathroom mat and she 
painted it with lipstick and makeup.

87
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,740
She had no recollection of it 
whatsoever,

88
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:31,870
but she painted it like a two year old 
would.

89
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:32,943
They got ahold of their mom's lipstick 
and she just woke up and what the fuck 

90
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,020
am I doing?
Like what is this?

91
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,460
Hey,
she got off easy.

92
00:03:39,461 --> 00:03:41,800
I've heard worse stories.
100 war stories.

93
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,521
Oh yeah,
no,

94
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:43,354
I,
I,

95
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,223
I have heard about murder.
I've heard about people driving their 

96
00:03:45,761 --> 00:03:47,050
car to someone's house,
killing them,

97
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:49,000
driving home and having no recollection 
of it.

98
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,193
A young woman in London,
climbed at the top of a construction 

99
00:03:52,091 --> 00:03:55,720
crane,
fell asleep on the huge counterweight so

100
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:58,750
far up over London,
wakes up in the morning,

101
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,660
birds around her.
She has no idea where she's at.

102
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,690
She is terrified.
Jesus Christ.

103
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:07,720
Yeah.
You writing about Ambien right now?

104
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,583
I am.

105
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,500
I can tell you locked in ambient and a 
hundred other other things.

106
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:19,501
So if it's fair to say you,
it seems like you're writing like one of

107
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:20,494
the,
you're one of the ways you collect data 

108
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,110
is almost like you're reporting on these
people.

109
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:30,310
Like you're,
you're collecting real life interactions

110
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:34,930
between people in real life 
characteristics and then you incorporate

111
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:37,240
them into fiction.
Exactly.

112
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,400
That's fair to say.
My degree is journalism.

113
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,263
I have no idea how to be with people.
So I need to introduce a topic and see 

114
00:04:45,071 --> 00:04:45,904
if it resonates and then get everybody's
take on these common experiences and 

115
00:04:49,751 --> 00:04:51,550
then pick the very best one.
So in a way,

116
00:04:51,551 --> 00:04:52,384
basically what I'm doing is kind of a,
an ongoing field study that becomes 

117
00:04:56,471 --> 00:04:59,890
whatever my next book is.
When you wrote Fight Club,

118
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,670
you tapped into something that w it was 
really fascinating for me.

119
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,653
Uh,
as someone who's been involved in 

120
00:05:05,411 --> 00:05:06,244
martial arts my whole life and I,
I'm kind of understood the Cathartic 

121
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:11,584
release of violence,
but I never saw it articulated the way 

122
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:20,530
you did and you made it entices 
[inaudible] for a thinking person.

123
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,880
He made it like you would,
you did it,

124
00:05:23,881 --> 00:05:25,690
you,
you sort of opened up these,

125
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:30,070
uh,
these doors of understanding for someone

126
00:05:30,071 --> 00:05:35,071
who may be maybe had frustration or had 
some pent up rage or had some,

127
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,070
some adjuncts that just was not going to
get out any other way.

128
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,120
And then you wrote about it and then 
when you bro,

129
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,200
you reading what you wrote at bank made 
you go,

130
00:05:44,201 --> 00:05:45,640
yeah,
okay.

131
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,050
Oh,
all right.

132
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,093
Now it's like you,
you added an element to it that really 

133
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:55,810
didn't exist before in pop culture.
It was really fascinating for me as a,

134
00:05:55,811 --> 00:05:56,644
as someone who's what,
watching that whole thing unfurl and 

135
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:03,410
watching people get like really 
resonating with people,

136
00:06:03,411 --> 00:06:06,650
watching people really getting excited 
about your work.

137
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:07,461
It's like,
oh,

138
00:06:07,461 --> 00:06:10,640
he hit some nerve that nobody really hit
before.

139
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:12,943
Right.
And it's not a nerve that gets hit very 

140
00:06:14,801 --> 00:06:15,720
much,
you know,

141
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:18,610
and it,
there's so many different aspects to it.

142
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,833
And what is just my classic thing is 
that there are so few social model 

143
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,970
novels or stories for men,
for women.

144
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,480
There are a s you know,
every season there's a new joy,

145
00:06:31,481 --> 00:06:32,314
luck club and knew how to make an 
American quilt a new traveling 

146
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,430
sisterhood of the Yamaha.
Yeah.

147
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,540
Whatever.
Just all these different models in which

148
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,450
women can come together and talk about 
their lives.

149
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:47,410
And if you're a man,
you've got either fight club or you have

150
00:06:47,411 --> 00:06:51,940
the dead poets society.
And that is really it.

151
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,043
So we don't have a lot of narratives 
that depict to men a role or a kind of 

152
00:06:57,341 --> 00:06:58,880
script of,
you know,

153
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,310
uh,
in which to come together and talk about

154
00:07:01,311 --> 00:07:02,144
their,
their shed.

155
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:05,320
And another thing is,
uh,

156
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,930
Jordan Peterson back to Jordan Peterson.

157
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:11,710
He talks about that need for really 
rough play.

158
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:16,250
And he talks about it a lot.
And a lot of my friends did.

159
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:20,020
They brag about how badly they're kids 
hurt them all.

160
00:07:20,021 --> 00:07:21,880
My Gosh,
my daughter came at me the other day.

161
00:07:21,881 --> 00:07:22,714
I had no idea how strong she was.
She pulled my arm out of the socket and 

162
00:07:26,771 --> 00:07:27,604
they're proud.
They're proud that their kid can play 

163
00:07:30,101 --> 00:07:32,140
that rough in his growing up that 
strong.

164
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:36,550
But you know,
we've kind of fallen away from this idea

165
00:07:36,551 --> 00:07:38,440
of consensual,
rough play.

166
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,990
And I think fight club resonated with 
that a lot.

167
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:42,543
And also the idea of Joseph Campbell's 
idea that there needs to be a secondary 

168
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:51,850
father in men's lives that you're born,
if you're lucky with a biological father

169
00:07:51,851 --> 00:07:54,380
that you do not choose.
And that is the,

170
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:55,563
the nurturing,
loving father that you eventually kind 

171
00:07:57,411 --> 00:07:58,570
of have to reject.

172
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:02,770
But in doing so,
you have to choose a new father and that

173
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,633
that father by choice typically is a,
a minister or a teacher or a drill 

174
00:08:08,861 --> 00:08:11,860
sergeant or a coach,
one of those fathers.

175
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,053
And you kind of put yourself in 
apprenticeship to the secondary father 

176
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,433
and you have to sort of consign your 
life to the secondary father and agree 

177
00:08:21,281 --> 00:08:22,870
to learn what they're going to teach 
you,

178
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,633
just like in karate kid.
And that is getting harder and harder 

179
00:08:28,361 --> 00:08:29,194
and harder to find.
So fight club was also depicting a new 

180
00:08:31,781 --> 00:08:34,630
form of the secondary father with all 
these,

181
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:39,220
these kids that were showing up on the 
doorstep of this ramshackle old house.

182
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,833
So there was just so many aspects of 
men's lives that were not being 

183
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,693
addressed when fight club came out and 
it sort of reinvented so many of those 

184
00:08:49,511 --> 00:08:53,260
things that had fallen by the wayside.
That's a huge part of martial arts.

185
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,950
A huge part of martial arts is your 
relationship with the master,

186
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,813
with the coach,
with finding someone who can guide you 

187
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:02,490
through the,
the most dangerous waters,

188
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,060
uh,
of competition that it's,

189
00:09:05,061 --> 00:09:05,894
it's absolutely imperative that bad 
relationships with coaches are 

190
00:09:08,851 --> 00:09:10,970
absolutely disastrous.
And it,

191
00:09:10,971 --> 00:09:11,804
it's,
it's imperative that someone find the 

192
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:13,884
right coach,
find someone who they really can trust 

193
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:20,040
and appreciate and you do develop.
It's a such a common theme.

194
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,690
They talk about this person being like a
son or this person being like a father.

195
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:25,981
You know,
I mean it's,

196
00:09:25,981 --> 00:09:26,814
um,
it's,

197
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:27,683
uh,
I,

198
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,250
I never thought about it that way.
I,

199
00:09:29,251 --> 00:09:31,350
I forgot about that part of Joseph 
Campbell.

200
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,110
But yeah,
that,

201
00:09:33,111 --> 00:09:34,620
that is a huge,
huge issue with,

202
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,660
with young men and young men getting 
into martial arts is something that I've

203
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:42,270
talked about so many times.
I don't discuss it as the need for rough

204
00:09:42,271 --> 00:09:44,490
play.
I say that human reward systems that are

205
00:09:44,491 --> 00:09:46,890
just not being,
did not being met,

206
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,143
and that systems that have been in place
for thousands and thousands of years 

207
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:54,720
that are designed to reward us for 
fighting off the enemy,

208
00:09:54,721 --> 00:09:59,721
running away from danger or developing 
physical skills and having a body that's

209
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:01,434
capable of,
of not just a physical activity but 

210
00:10:05,551 --> 00:10:06,384
violence.

211
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,360
Well and beyond just that,
you know,

212
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,990
it's also the whole idea of 
apprenticeship in a,

213
00:10:12,991 --> 00:10:17,970
whether you're apprenticing yourself to 
a fighting coach or to a metallurgist or

214
00:10:17,971 --> 00:10:21,090
to a welder or to a brick layer or to a 
mason,

215
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,463
you are apprenticing yourself to 
somebody that you're going to do all 

216
00:10:25,141 --> 00:10:28,050
this grunt work for.
But in exchange you're going to,

217
00:10:28,051 --> 00:10:31,050
you're going to learn that kind of 
really master skill at something.

218
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:31,903
Um,
and so it's a way of mastering yourself 

219
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,240
as you mastered this other thing.
So you know,

220
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,970
it,
it's not just always a physical,

221
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,110
you know,
fighting thing.

222
00:10:43,111 --> 00:10:46,740
It doesn't have to be in that form,
just difficult.

223
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,470
Something that's a struggle,
something that's hard to learn.

224
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,790
Right?
Yeah.

225
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:55,280
And that relationship that you have with
that secondary father to the,

226
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,640
it's almost in some ways more intense.
The,

227
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,613
the,
the pride of someone teaching you 

228
00:11:01,321 --> 00:11:02,154
something and then you eventually 
developing those skills and then this 

229
00:11:05,221 --> 00:11:06,054
person who is teaching you this being 
proud of your work is extremely 

230
00:11:09,481 --> 00:11:10,314
satisfactory.

231
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:11,603
Well,
and do you remember officer and a 

232
00:11:12,361 --> 00:11:13,320
gentleman?
Yeah.

233
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:17,210
You know,
Richard Gere really has this drunken dis

234
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:21,870
not their dad and then he has this drill
sergeant who's constantly trying to wash

235
00:11:21,871 --> 00:11:26,310
them out and then finally he reaches it 
at the existential crisis of saying,

236
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,120
you can't throw me out of the service 
because I have no nothing else.

237
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,523
I have nowhere else to go in the world.
My life will amount to nothing unless I 

238
00:11:34,921 --> 00:11:37,500
can master this thing.
And he said,

239
00:11:37,501 --> 00:11:38,334
relatively young man.
But it is that existentialist stick 

240
00:11:40,831 --> 00:11:41,664
moment where you,
you realize that you have to sacrifice 

241
00:11:44,311 --> 00:11:47,790
your youth for something.
You're not going to live forever.

242
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,953
It's a very martin heidegger moment 
where you realize you have to become a 

243
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,280
being,
living towards death.

244
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,113
You're not going to live forever and 
you've got to give your life to 

245
00:11:56,981 --> 00:11:58,570
something.
Now,

246
00:11:58,571 --> 00:11:59,240
when you

247
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,073
approach a novel like that,
when you have a story like that that's 

248
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:02,804
brewing your head,
how do you decide what to pull the 

249
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,180
trigger on?
Like do you just go on instinct?

250
00:12:08,181 --> 00:12:11,270
Did you just have a,
a concept in your head and it just seems

251
00:12:11,271 --> 00:12:13,100
more and more attractive and you just 
say,

252
00:12:13,101 --> 00:12:13,940
okay,
this is it.

253
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:17,123
You know,
one really good test is if you can take 

254
00:12:19,471 --> 00:12:22,500
it to a party and you can tell a very 
small part of it,

255
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:23,663
as much of it as you know at that point.
And people will vie for a chance to 

256
00:12:30,391 --> 00:12:33,990
relate some aspect of their life that is
very much like that,

257
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,050
but an even more extreme example of 
that.

258
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,333
So in a way they're there,
they're flushing out your theme with 

259
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:41,844
parts of their own lives.
And so you find yourself drawing from 

260
00:12:44,011 --> 00:12:48,090
the experience of dozens or hundreds or 
thousands of people,

261
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,820
and at the same time you're Beta testing
it.

262
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,953
You're kind of taking it on the road and
you're seeing that it's an idea that 

263
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:55,374
resonates,
resonates with a huge number of people 

264
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,880
that everyone can relate to it.
Hmm.

265
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,793
That's interesting.
So do you purposely let go to parties 

266
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:04,703
with like a,
a couple bullets in the chamber 

267
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,143
sometimes or sometimes they just go to 
the party and I listened to hear 

268
00:13:12,061 --> 00:13:12,894
somebody tell that,
that personal anecdote that does evoke 

269
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,333
all those other anecdotes because a 
great anecdote doesn't leave people 

270
00:13:21,241 --> 00:13:22,074
speechless.
It leaves some competing to tell a 

271
00:13:24,901 --> 00:13:25,734
better version of the same thing.
And that's when a real writer to starts 

272
00:13:30,181 --> 00:13:30,811
realizing,
okay,

273
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:34,140
there's a pattern and that can be turned
into something really big.

274
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:37,350
That's really interesting.
There's a parallel there,

275
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,580
comedy for sure.
That's if you in good material,

276
00:13:41,581 --> 00:13:42,750
oftentimes,
not always,

277
00:13:42,751 --> 00:13:44,370
but oftentimes you'll see the audience 
going,

278
00:13:44,371 --> 00:13:46,290
Oh my God,
you do that or yeah,

279
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,720
that's fascinating.
Now,

280
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:49,683
um,
nothing I really wanted to talk to you 

281
00:13:50,551 --> 00:13:52,140
about is something that you brought up,
uh,

282
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,790
when you send the notes to Matt,
uh,

283
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:57,290
was um,
censorship and that and,

284
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,890
and,
and self censorship,

285
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,113
which is going on apparently.
And writer groups and groups of people 

286
00:14:04,141 --> 00:14:08,580
that are deciding that certain words 
should be eliminated from vocabulary and

287
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:12,300
from vernacular and that you shouldn't 
discuss certain things anymore.

288
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,433
These things are,
it's harming fiction and harming 

289
00:14:16,561 --> 00:14:19,260
literature.
Do you can't explore the darker ideas,

290
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,290
you know?
Oh,

291
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:25,130
you want to see me crucify myself right 
now?

292
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,180
Yeah.
Okay.

293
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,550
This is kind of the,
uh,

294
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:32,290
career ending moment for,
uh,

295
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:36,910
for several years I was in a writer's 
workshop and uh,

296
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:40,100
the core group of us had been meeting 
since 1990.

297
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,800
So this is a workshop that was almost 30
years old.

298
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:48,820
And gradually people were asking each 
other not to use certain words.

299
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,190
Uh,
first,

300
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:54,170
you know,
nobody really used the n word,

301
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,870
but it was definitely a word you could 
not bring to workshop.

302
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,363
And then in a story,
I use the word faggot and a very good 

303
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:01,994
friend of mine said,
you're not bringing that word into 

304
00:15:04,251 --> 00:15:05,084
workshop.
You're not writing anything with the F 

305
00:15:07,161 --> 00:15:08,860
word.
And,

306
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:13,940
and it just became more and more tightly
structured that way.

307
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:19,690
And so eventually I realized we were 
kind of writing to make each other happy

308
00:15:19,821 --> 00:15:22,430
instead of to kind of confront each 
other.

309
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,373
And uh,
one of the writers in our workshop is a 

310
00:15:26,151 --> 00:15:28,230
writer named Cheryl strayed,
who,

311
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:31,880
who had written a book called wild,
which was a hugely successful book.

312
00:15:31,881 --> 00:15:32,714
It was chosen as an oprah book and it 
will be on bookstore shelves for the 

313
00:15:36,681 --> 00:15:38,540
rest of history.
Sheryl's book,

314
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:41,060
wild.
But while she was writing it,

315
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:42,403
she had written a segment about how as a
child she would be sat on the sofa with 

316
00:15:49,071 --> 00:15:54,071
her grandfather and her grandfather 
taught her how to masturbate him.

317
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:55,603
And so as a child she would masturbate 
her grandfather until he achieved 

318
00:15:59,511 --> 00:16:00,344
orgasm.
And then later she would find these 

319
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,740
featherless featherless birds that had 
fallen out of a nest.

320
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:13,550
And she picked one up and she knew it 
would die.

321
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,490
So she crushed it between her bare 
hands.

322
00:16:16,491 --> 00:16:17,324
This is a very small child.
And she wrote how as that bird died 

323
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:27,320
crushed between her hands,
it its death throes.

324
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,303
It's spasms of death felt exactly like 
her grandfather's penis ejaculating in 

325
00:16:33,231 --> 00:16:34,860
her little hand.
Whoa.

326
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:40,540
That was the best thing she ever wrote.
And her editor,

327
00:16:40,911 --> 00:16:41,744
Rick [inaudible] said,
that is not going in this book because 

328
00:16:45,861 --> 00:16:46,694
we want this book to be a big book.
And if we see you jerking off your 

329
00:16:51,141 --> 00:16:51,974
grandfather and then killing baby birds,
that is not going to make Oprah Winfrey 

330
00:16:57,471 --> 00:17:01,940
happy.
So it was a magnificent piece of writing

331
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:06,470
and a magnificent kind of parallel and 
awareness for a child to have.

332
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,310
And this juxtaposition of sexual abuse 
and death.

333
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,110
It was magnificent.
Oh my God,

334
00:17:12,111 --> 00:17:16,100
it worked on every level.
But the publisher said,

335
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:16,934
this is not going to be in the book.
Did she send it to you or did she show 

336
00:17:19,701 --> 00:17:21,830
it to you?
She brought her to workshop and she read

337
00:17:21,831 --> 00:17:24,090
it.
There was even a newspaper reporter pre,

338
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,890
uh,
present there and we all realized it was

339
00:17:27,891 --> 00:17:29,390
fantastically powerful.

340
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,800
But then she said,
they won't take this.

341
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:37,670
This can't go in.
Wow.

342
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:41,870
Did she do anything with it?
So she published it online or no end.

343
00:17:41,871 --> 00:17:42,704
There was so many parts of that book.
There was so much better than what they 

344
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,870
actually did publish,
really.

345
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:48,763
And so it's that kind of censorship 
where you're trying to reach a reader 

346
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:54,893
standing in line at starbucks and this 
has got to go in that point of purchase 

347
00:17:59,251 --> 00:18:03,630
stand and it's gotta be a face out.
And I understand for a long time,

348
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:07,470
if you wanted to face out yet a barnes 
and noble,

349
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,310
especially on the discover new writers 
face out stack,

350
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:12,563
you can not have the word fuck on the 
first page because they did not want 

351
00:18:16,351 --> 00:18:17,184
people picking up that book and opening 
it and seeing the f word that that just 

352
00:18:21,691 --> 00:18:24,720
did not fit their corporate culture.
And so,

353
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,240
you know,
so much of the censorship is,

354
00:18:27,241 --> 00:18:28,074
is because people really want to reach 
the largest audience without offending 

355
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:36,861
people.
But there's giant problems with that.

356
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,430
Right?
I mean,

357
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:43,043
one of the more fascinating things about
books is that the story plays out in 

358
00:18:46,711 --> 00:18:48,540
your mind.
Exactly.

359
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:49,374
The nature of consumption makes it about
the only medium in which you can go to 

360
00:18:53,431 --> 00:18:55,440
those places.
Yeah.

361
00:18:55,441 --> 00:18:57,510
Literally you,
you couldn't,

362
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,630
there's no way you'd be able to find,

363
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,653
to put that in a book,
Her story about her grandfather and the 

364
00:19:05,851 --> 00:19:08,430
bird.
Maybe you could put the burden,

365
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,880
but the grandfather par,
there's no snow way.

366
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,890
Yeah.
And I,

367
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,733
I,
I feel like I'm telling stories out of 

368
00:19:17,641 --> 00:19:18,474
school,
but it's such a perfect example of that 

369
00:19:20,731 --> 00:19:23,080
kind of self censorship.
Uh,

370
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:26,850
and it's also something so magnificent 
that I feel is should come out.

371
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:29,050
It should sort of be stated.
Uh,

372
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,880
I don't want to steal her thunder.
I wanted to honor the story,

373
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,940
but it's like so many stories that 
people tell me.

374
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,430
Uh,
I'm kind of seen as a safe person,

375
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,010
you know,
kind of a degraded monster maybe,

376
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,960
but as a degraded monster with no self 
esteem whatsoever.

377
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,183
They feel safe telling me these things 
because in a way they probably feel a 

378
00:19:51,121 --> 00:19:53,940
little morally superior to me.
Um,

379
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,670
why do you think people would consider 
you a degraded monster?

380
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:57,863
Because I can read a story like guts 
that is so completely humiliating 

381
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,510
because as I read it,
it's in the first person.

382
00:20:06,511 --> 00:20:10,050
So people more or less assume that it's 
my story,

383
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,650
even though it's stories garnered from 
many different people.

384
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,113
But the fact that I'm presenting it 
means that I'm the person that is this 

385
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:19,463
losing face and afterwards people feel 
like they can risk losing face by 

386
00:20:23,521 --> 00:20:27,360
telling me their story.
That's very much like the gut story.

387
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:31,620
So when someone is writing something 
that's deeply disturbing like that,

388
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:32,250
when you,
when you,

389
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:37,250
when you hit those parts of your mind 
and you come to this pathway d,

390
00:20:37,351 --> 00:20:38,610
do you consider,
do you say,

391
00:20:38,611 --> 00:20:40,980
well no one's ever going to allow this 
to be in a book.

392
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,580
No one's ever,
do you consider those thoughts or do you

393
00:20:44,581 --> 00:20:49,510
just go through with it first and then 
review it?

394
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,480
Or do you not do that at all?
You know,

395
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:57,370
my formative years with a punk,
heres the 70s into the 80s and we always

396
00:20:57,371 --> 00:20:59,020
used to have a saying,
people would say,

397
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:00,363
ah,
don't hit the brake until you hear the 

398
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:05,230
glass break or don't stop until you hear
glass break.

399
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,633
And so I always think the point of 
writing is to coach yourself to that 

400
00:21:11,141 --> 00:21:15,070
point that you would never have gone 
voluntarily.

401
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,413
And also to coach your reader to the 
point where the reader would never have 

402
00:21:19,271 --> 00:21:22,120
gone voluntarily.
And a story like guts,

403
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,613
you know,
it's very funny on the front end and if 

404
00:21:25,331 --> 00:21:27,940
you told people on the front end where 
it was going to go,

405
00:21:27,941 --> 00:21:28,774
they'd never read that story.
But it's very funny and charming and 

406
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:32,524
well paced on the front.
And then once people realize where it's 

407
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:38,380
going to go,
they're already trapped.

408
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,390
And so in a way is,
it's a way to enjoy that though.

409
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,670
Like the way you said they're already 
trapped.

410
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,950
You seem to take some satisfaction in 
that.

411
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,993
But in writing it,
I'm also sort of springing the trap on 

412
00:21:52,751 --> 00:21:57,751
myself starting down a path that I have 
no idea is going to be so humiliating or

413
00:21:58,691 --> 00:21:59,640
so,
uh,

414
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:03,640
emotionally upsetting or so dark.
Because if,

415
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:06,430
if I did,
I would never go down that path.

416
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:12,250
When you write a story like that,
how much of a deep plan out in advance

417
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:17,510
I might plan out up to the end of the 
second act.

418
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:21,560
You know,
at the moment of greatest crisis,

419
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,840
this will happen,
you know,

420
00:22:23,841 --> 00:22:24,674
in fight club,
the moment of greatest crisis is going 

421
00:22:26,841 --> 00:22:27,674
to be when everyone in the support 
groups figures out that this guy is 

422
00:22:30,861 --> 00:22:31,694
lying to them and they're all given the 
choice of either accepting him for his 

423
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,630
transgressions or rejecting him.
Same thing in choke.

424
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,580
There's going to be that moment.
And uh,

425
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,653
when people realize that he has faked 
choking and that he's made them into a 

426
00:22:49,011 --> 00:22:54,011
fake hero and they're going to either 
kill him or accept him.

427
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:00,520
And so I typically know that the second 
act is going to end with a transgression

428
00:23:00,681 --> 00:23:03,320
being revealed.
But beyond that,

429
00:23:03,321 --> 00:23:04,154
I don't want to know because I want the 
story to complete itself with its own 

430
00:23:07,101 --> 00:23:10,310
momentum at that point.
And if it doesn't surprise me beyond the

431
00:23:10,311 --> 00:23:11,144
second act,
then it's not going to surprise the 

432
00:23:12,771 --> 00:23:13,604
reader.

433
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,343
Do you write,
do you have like a storyboard laid out 

434
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:18,403
and do,
do you use like index cards or anything 

435
00:23:20,091 --> 00:23:23,750
to figure out where things are going or 
do you just Kinda know now?

436
00:23:23,751 --> 00:23:24,584
No,
you know,

437
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:28,550
that's part of the glory is that 
whenever I get stuck,

438
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,980
I go to the gym and I say,
okay,

439
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:31,993
I'm working on this scene where this 
happens and this happens and this 

440
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:36,920
happens.
And my friends will say,

441
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:37,813
they'll always be somebody there with a 
really fresh take and life experience 

442
00:23:40,941 --> 00:23:41,960
who can say,
well,

443
00:23:41,961 --> 00:23:42,794
have you thought about this happening?
And it will take the story in a 

444
00:23:45,981 --> 00:23:46,814
direction that is so unexpected because 
it's not from my experience and that 

445
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:52,514
that's the glory.
And they feel like they've contributed 

446
00:23:54,321 --> 00:23:55,490
there.
They're so happy.

447
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:59,210
And uh,
and I'm happy to spend time among people

448
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:02,750
and I'm happy to have the story complete
in a way that I never,

449
00:24:02,751 --> 00:24:04,190
ever could have anticipated.

450
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,100
That's fascinating.
So you do it at the gym.

451
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,313
Yeah,
the gym is really great because you're 

452
00:24:10,011 --> 00:24:13,340
around people and you have these 
recoveries between sets.

453
00:24:13,341 --> 00:24:16,760
So you have a little time to talk.
And at the same time you have,

454
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:20,390
during the exercise itself,
you have time to think.

455
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:21,973
And so it paces the talking versus a 
thinking and it's also kind of highly 

456
00:24:27,321 --> 00:24:28,154
oxygenated and it's physically active.
And your mind is kind of mind is not 

457
00:24:33,351 --> 00:24:36,770
engaged with something else.
Your mind has kind of disengaged like it

458
00:24:36,771 --> 00:24:39,310
is while you're taking a shower.
Yeah.

459
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:42,340
A lot of people like to walk.
They like to read a write,

460
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:43,603
read a little bit of it,
and then walk and bring a recorder or 

461
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:49,400
their phone to record on think.
Probably along the same lines,

462
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:54,610
Charles Dickens walked somewhere between
12 and 20 miles a day as he wrote.

463
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:56,870
Whoa.

464
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:57,430
And the,
uh,

465
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:00,290
the lakeland poets walked constantly.
I mean,

466
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:03,320
walking is a big part of writing 
anything physical,

467
00:25:03,321 --> 00:25:04,041
right?
Like anything,

468
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:05,330
we,
you're forcing your body to move,

469
00:25:05,331 --> 00:25:06,164
forcing the blood to flow and also 
mindless so it allows your mind to 

470
00:25:10,011 --> 00:25:11,780
wander.
Yeah.

471
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:17,720
So I love the fact that you're so open 
with these ideas too,

472
00:25:17,721 --> 00:25:18,554
that you're,
you bring them to people and get their 

473
00:25:20,271 --> 00:25:22,460
take on it and then incorporate their 
take.

474
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,130
Is this something you've always done 
because of the workshopping?

475
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:27,163
Is it because it just is this 
willingness to be open with your ideas 

476
00:25:30,411 --> 00:25:32,880
and express them?
Yeah.

477
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,870
Really in a workshop was the crucial 
thing.

478
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:39,200
Having that social expectation that 
you're going to bring work every week.

479
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:42,920
And it was also kind of a party,
a reward for having brought the work.

480
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,233
And it was also a way of testing the 
work so that you knew whether it was 

481
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,920
working,
you know,

482
00:25:48,921 --> 00:25:52,400
you weren't constantly sort of 
questioning yourself.

483
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:57,900
A workshop just provide so many really 
important ways of uh,

484
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,083
keeping right,
keeping you writing now w e and you've 

485
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,180
done this always.
They've seems like you've done this most

486
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:07,070
of your career.
I have,

487
00:26:07,071 --> 00:26:09,950
and this is not the first workshop I've 
been bumped out of.

488
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,143
The first workshop I was in was a very,
a lot of very nice ladies and I was 

489
00:26:15,621 --> 00:26:18,830
probably 28 and I had written a scene in
which,

490
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,720
uh,
a man,

491
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:24,290
a young man has done up an inflatable 
sex doll.

492
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,840
So it looks exactly like the woman he's 
obsessed with.

493
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:32,240
And during the,
the seduction of this sex doll,

494
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,553
he accidentally snags the back of it 
with a zipper of its dress and he 

495
00:26:36,831 --> 00:26:41,831
realizes during the fornication that it 
is gradually losing air.

496
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,063
So he's got to copulate faster and 
faster to try to achieve orgasm before 

497
00:26:47,341 --> 00:26:48,900
this thing completely goes flat.

498
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:53,850
And at the end of the scene,
he's standing there with this completely

499
00:26:53,851 --> 00:26:57,570
deflated sex doll hanging off of his 
erection like this,

500
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:00,930
the surrender flag.
And of course,

501
00:27:00,931 --> 00:27:05,670
his mother walks into the room.
And after I wrote that scene,

502
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:09,930
the leader of the workshop,
I was in my first workshop,

503
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,620
she took me aside afterwards and she 
said,

504
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:14,463
uh,
the other writers in the workshop no 

505
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:20,010
longer feel safe around you.
She really did.

506
00:27:20,011 --> 00:27:22,110
She,
she said,

507
00:27:22,111 --> 00:27:24,210
you've written something that really 
frightens them,

508
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,333
uh,
and they would like you to politely 

509
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:31,200
leave the workshop and not come back.
Wow.

510
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,380
And so that's when I started with,
uh,

511
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:37,620
Tom Spann bowers workshop in which 
almost anything wet.

512
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,013
Um,
and so this kind of periodic implosion 

513
00:27:42,211 --> 00:27:43,440
of the workshop,
uh,

514
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,720
is kind of part of the process.
Well,

515
00:27:45,721 --> 00:27:48,360
it seems only twice right?
Or more and more times than that.

516
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,130
You know,
it's been twice,

517
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,470
uh,
but in the past it's catastrophic.

518
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,420
Twice catastrophic.
Yeah.

519
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,393
Yeah.
But a few other flat tires along the 

520
00:27:57,271 --> 00:27:58,104
way.
Uh,

521
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:02,880
periodically we've kind of had to 
pretend that we were disbanding in order

522
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:04,950
to get rid of a member who was a,
uh,

523
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,760
just more trouble than they were worth.
How many people are in these workshops?

524
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,860
Boy,
lately it's been last,

525
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:13,470
it was about eight,
but we've been up to like 16,

526
00:28:13,471 --> 00:28:14,880
17.
And now when I teach,

527
00:28:14,881 --> 00:28:16,710
I typically have about 25 people.

528
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:19,950
What does it feel,
I mean,

529
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:24,600
to be in a workshop for that long and 
then have such a,

530
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:29,580
a disagreement and to disband like that 
or to have you forced out,

531
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,500
what does that feel like?
That's got to suck.

532
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:33,181
No,
you know,

533
00:28:33,181 --> 00:28:35,970
I think in a way we all need a kind of a
respite from each other.

534
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:40,710
We all had kind of knew what to expect 
from one another and I think we were all

535
00:28:40,711 --> 00:28:43,620
less,
less of a resource for one another.

536
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,390
Uh,
you know,

537
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,490
there's always a chance we'll come back 
together.

538
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:48,773
So,
uh,

539
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:52,500
so it's not a big tragedy.
So there's a chance that they might,

540
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,830
so did they kick you out or did they 
just disband?

541
00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:00,270
I left the workshop and I understood 
that it disbanded wreck after that.

542
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,793
The seams.
I just don't understand how someone who 

543
00:29:03,901 --> 00:29:08,320
is a creative writer can't understand 
the,

544
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,053
the not just the necessity,
like the need to delve into the darker 

545
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:19,610
possibilities of,
of human reality that this,

546
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,153
those stories she wrote about her 
grandfather in the bird is a perfect 

547
00:29:24,121 --> 00:29:24,954
example of that.

548
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,430
I mean,
although very few people will experience

549
00:29:27,431 --> 00:29:28,264
that in their life,
we all can appreciate that these are 

550
00:29:29,941 --> 00:29:32,370
possible scenarios.
And I think it,

551
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,860
it,
it really comes down to what people,

552
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,073
uh,
what purpose reading and writing serves 

553
00:29:37,741 --> 00:29:40,350
in people's lives.
And most people,

554
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,880
they want reading to be a comforting 
activity.

555
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,073
They want to be able to read a book and 
then fall asleep knowing the detective 

556
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,420
will apprehend the killer by the end of 
the book.

557
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:50,733
That things will end very well in a way 
that you want to be bored or lulled by 

558
00:29:53,561 --> 00:29:54,930
the book.
Uh,

559
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:58,540
not so many people really want to be 
kind of confronted by books,

560
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,380
but some people do.
Right?

561
00:30:01,381 --> 00:30:01,951
I mean,
isn't it,

562
00:30:01,951 --> 00:30:05,190
it's kind of like a pretty much all 
forms of art.

563
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:09,150
Whether it's music or movies,
I mean there's superhero movies and then

564
00:30:09,151 --> 00:30:09,984
there's movies like no country for old 
men or the bad guy gets away at the end 

565
00:30:12,841 --> 00:30:13,674
and you'll,
you leave the movie theater and you're 

566
00:30:14,491 --> 00:30:15,420
like,
what the fuck?

567
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,460
You know?
But those,

568
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:22,050
those are all satisfying in different 
ways to different people.

569
00:30:22,051 --> 00:30:22,884
And isn't that sort of the point of 
creative expression is that you're 

570
00:30:26,851 --> 00:30:30,000
getting surprised,
you're getting taken down a row that is,

571
00:30:30,001 --> 00:30:34,020
here's the world through this person's 
eyes and they create this world.

572
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,790
If you put limitations on that,
you're going to,

573
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:37,903
yeah,
you're going to eliminate some 

574
00:30:38,821 --> 00:30:41,100
disturbing aspects that my bother some 
people.

575
00:30:41,101 --> 00:30:44,620
But you're also gonna eliminate some 
magical moments that might just carry,

576
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:47,790
might literally let,
might change the way you view people.

577
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:53,400
You know,
part of it has to do with the nature of,

578
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:54,540
you know,
movies,

579
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,880
movies are going to always kind of 
attract,

580
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,460
uh,
a more dynamic audience.

581
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:00,323
Movies carry their own authority through
motion and books are going to be a 

582
00:31:04,711 --> 00:31:08,820
slower medium that's harder to consume.
And so maybe books are always going to,

583
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,620
at this point,
be seen of it as kind of a sedative as a

584
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:17,670
kind of thing that lulls you and 
conference you and puts you to sleep.

585
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,140
But by who?

586
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,630
By some people,
right?

587
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,231
I mean,
I mean,

588
00:31:21,231 --> 00:31:23,180
maybe there's a market for those kinds 
of books,

589
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:25,100
but there's also a market for your 
books.

590
00:31:25,101 --> 00:31:25,934
There's,
there's,

591
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,793
there's clearly a market for people that
they want to tap into those more 

592
00:31:30,291 --> 00:31:31,124
disturbing

593
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:36,150
backs of consciousness and reality.
And that market is moving to video games

594
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,760
and that market is moving to edgier 
films.

595
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:43,210
There's just other forms of storytelling
that are serving that market better.

596
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,470
Really?
Oh yeah.

597
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:46,120
Better than books.
Oh yeah.

598
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,140
Yeah.

599
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:47,973
But why is that?
Is that because of the censorship or 

600
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:54,640
it's because artists aren't exploring 
those ideas as much anymore.

601
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:55,843
You know,
and part of it is because books are 

602
00:31:56,871 --> 00:31:57,704
harder to consume.
Books take an enormous amount of a 

603
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:06,580
commitment of time and effort to read a 
book where everything else is 30 minutes

604
00:32:07,491 --> 00:32:10,160
to two hours and to write a book as well
mean,

605
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:15,230
such a solitary discipline to sit alone 
with your computer.

606
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,910
No,
it is not,

607
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,080
not for me.
And I,

608
00:32:18,081 --> 00:32:20,570
I hate that model.
You know,

609
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:22,243
I want to be in the mermaid tavern 
talking about my ideas with my 

610
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:25,723
compatriots and getting their take on 
him and finding out how it resonates 

611
00:32:29,601 --> 00:32:32,300
with everything else in people's lives.
What's The mermaid tavern?

612
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,120
Oh,
is the,

613
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,700
the reference to where,
uh,

614
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:40,250
um,
not coleridge.

615
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,980
All the famous writers of Shakespeare's 
time,

616
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,620
ah,
basically hung out at a,

617
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:47,690
it was like the white horse tavern in 
New York,

618
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,300
but the mermaid tavern was in London 
during that time.

619
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,420
Um,
and uh,

620
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,450
Boswell,
uh,

621
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,513
all the writers hung out there and 
exchange ideas and entertained one 

622
00:32:57,841 --> 00:32:59,550
another.
Hmm.

623
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:04,490
And so I want writing to be my social 
outlet,

624
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,080
but you have to write it by herself.
Right?

625
00:33:09,081 --> 00:33:09,914
I mean when you're,
when you're sitting alone actually 

626
00:33:11,751 --> 00:33:15,590
putting your fingers on the keyboards.
No,

627
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,630
you,
you do that part in airplanes.

628
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:18,920
Really?
Yeah,

629
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:21,770
I've right.
Notebooks and notebooks and notebooks in

630
00:33:21,771 --> 00:33:22,604
public.
And then when I'm trapped in some 

631
00:33:23,961 --> 00:33:26,510
unbearable place,
like an airplane or an airport,

632
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:30,140
then I do that horrible part of 
keyboarding.

633
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,013
Yeah.
So that's the only time you actually 

634
00:33:33,231 --> 00:33:34,064
write,
right?

635
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,180
The keyboarding is not writing.
You remember the Truman Capote,

636
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,950
he quote about uh,
on the road,

637
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:43,130
Jack Kerouac Capote,
he said that's not writing.

638
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:44,023
That's typing and still the part on the 
airplane or in the airport where you 

639
00:33:48,201 --> 00:33:50,480
have the laptop open.
That's not writing.

640
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,170
Really.

641
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:53,810
That's typing.
This is writing.

642
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:57,100
Writing to you is physical pen to paper.
Ah,

643
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,970
sloppy everything.
Yeah.

644
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,740
Why is that?
Why is it different?

645
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,400
Because it's written down in the moment 
that you hear it.

646
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:05,953
And that is not set in new times.
Roman 12 point so that it looks so 

647
00:34:09,861 --> 00:34:10,694
finished.
It looks like a finished book and it's 

648
00:34:11,871 --> 00:34:15,230
much harder to monkey with it.
Once you see it on that screen.

649
00:34:15,231 --> 00:34:16,870
And in word,
uh,

650
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,940
it looks like a book.
It's much harder to edit it,

651
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:23,540
but when it's scrawled on the page in 
front of you,

652
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:26,390
you can draw arrows,
you can scribble it out,

653
00:34:26,391 --> 00:34:28,160
you can,
you can do whatever you want to.

654
00:34:28,161 --> 00:34:30,080
It is,
it's much less precious.

655
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:34,130
Is this something that you voted this,
the approach of Oh taken.

656
00:34:34,131 --> 00:34:34,964
Did you learn this approach or is it 
something that just sort of made sense 

657
00:34:37,761 --> 00:34:38,594
to you?

658
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:42,560
This is how old I am.
It used to be,

659
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,713
I grew up in the age of uh,
typewriters when even typewriters were 

660
00:34:48,021 --> 00:34:51,200
kind of precious because you would have 
to buy ribbons for them.

661
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,423
And those ribbons were really expensive.
And so something had to be written out 

662
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:57,703
completely.
Long hand had to be perfect longhand 

663
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:06,400
before you could risk wasting a 
typewriter ribbon to type it out.

664
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,373
Wow.
So you just developed it this way and 

665
00:35:11,721 --> 00:35:14,210
just stuck with it.
Even the age of computers.

666
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:15,463
Well,
and also because writing is something I 

667
00:35:17,631 --> 00:35:22,220
do in the moment,
somebody says something insightful,

668
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:23,263
something really bright,
something phrased just wrong so that 

669
00:35:26,421 --> 00:35:30,830
it's suddenly really fresh and I want to
be able to write it down in that moment.

670
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:34,250
So that when I do have to go to the 
boring part with a keyboard,

671
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:35,623
I have got so much wonderful fresh stuff
that it makes a keyboarding part fun 

672
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:43,410
because it allows me to sort of archive 
and a cure rate,

673
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:44,543
preserve these fantastically bright 
things that were said by so many 

674
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:50,430
different people.
And you don't,

675
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,293
do you ever record,
do you ever record yourself like record 

676
00:35:54,631 --> 00:35:56,550
ideas then listened to them transcribe 
them?

677
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,593
Oh God,
no,

678
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,493
no.
I hate that.

679
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,573
That was a big hunter s Thompson thing.
He would record a lot of his ideas and 

680
00:36:03,181 --> 00:36:06,870
then transcribe them and write them out.
You know,

681
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,350
I kinda write word for word sentence for
sentence.

682
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,270
And so,
uh,

683
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:16,780
the transcription is just too much of an
effort for me.

684
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,510
Usually when I do interviews for 
magazines,

685
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:20,743
um,
I will record my interview subjects and 

686
00:36:23,111 --> 00:36:25,050
even then,
uh,

687
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:29,770
transcribing the interviews is so it's 
such a misery because people seldom talk

688
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:30,604
in complete sentences and there's so 
many false starts and so many sentences 

689
00:36:34,481 --> 00:36:36,540
that just don't go anywhere.
Right.

690
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,253
So no,
talking into a recorder is just that a 

691
00:36:42,311 --> 00:36:45,070
mess.
And so this notebook,

692
00:36:45,071 --> 00:36:48,910
do you have in front of you this,
this is a notebook for life or is this a

693
00:36:48,911 --> 00:36:51,400
notebook for particular project?
Like how do you,

694
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:55,840
how do you organize it?
This is a notebook where three pages are

695
00:36:55,841 --> 00:37:00,340
devoted to topics that I will talk to 
you about if we're desperate.

696
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:02,763
And uh,
they're a little notes in here about 

697
00:37:04,271 --> 00:37:06,850
contacting my agent for different 
issues.

698
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,680
Also,
it's all universal.

699
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,370
It's like for all sorts of things,
for tasks that you need to do.

700
00:37:12,371 --> 00:37:14,950
And then as well as that parts of books 
you're writing.

701
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,940
And there's all these little notes that 
Jamie just gave me about microphones.

702
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:20,283
Yeah.
You're writing something about someone 

703
00:37:21,221 --> 00:37:23,170
who's into recording equipment.
Yeah.

704
00:37:23,171 --> 00:37:25,660
That's just a small part of it.
But that's what she knows.

705
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:26,723
And now this,
I want to go back to this workshop 

706
00:37:30,191 --> 00:37:32,710
thing.
Like what was it?

707
00:37:32,711 --> 00:37:34,400
Just words,
just the,

708
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:37,210
the use of the word faggot or the n 
word.

709
00:37:37,211 --> 00:37:38,044
It was just words that characters were 
utilizing in your story that was so 

710
00:37:42,371 --> 00:37:43,300
disturbing to them.

711
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:45,083
Yeah,

712
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:46,483
it was words,
but it was also some situations that I 

713
00:37:48,091 --> 00:37:49,160
thought were,
you know,

714
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:52,910
I got that people were very upset by 
people would leave the room where people

715
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:57,000
would leave the room or what would weep,
uh,

716
00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:01,010
would weep in just complete upset.
Does part of you go,

717
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:01,903
yeah,
I got this and you see someone weeping 

718
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:05,840
some shit you wrote?
No,

719
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:07,003
most of the time people would go to the 
bathroom and weep and I would find out 

720
00:38:09,141 --> 00:38:11,680
about it much later.
So I said,

721
00:38:11,681 --> 00:38:13,820
did you get post satisfaction that way?
No.

722
00:38:13,821 --> 00:38:14,654
It just made me feel like a bully and 
that really kind of another thing that 

723
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,753
is a thin line,
especially when I read a story like 

724
00:38:21,771 --> 00:38:22,604
guts,
am I entertaining people or am I 

725
00:38:27,261 --> 00:38:31,640
bullying them?
Am I beating them up and I also bullying

726
00:38:31,641 --> 00:38:33,230
wine that way.
Why do you what?

727
00:38:33,231 --> 00:38:34,064
Describe it that way.
Kind of charming them into a story that 

728
00:38:36,791 --> 00:38:39,190
eventually will make them faint.
Or eventually we'll,

729
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:43,120
we'll make them Rach,
but will upset them very deeply.

730
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,450
Uh,
and I,

731
00:38:45,451 --> 00:38:47,950
I feel a real reluctance about that.

732
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:54,070
Doesn't that sort of have to bridge,
have to be crossed though if you're,

733
00:38:54,071 --> 00:38:54,904
if you're really going to explore every 
single possibility in a creative 

734
00:38:58,121 --> 00:38:58,960
narrative,
if you're,

735
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:03,100
if you're really gonna write a book and 
just let your mind go wild,

736
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,140
that has to be on the table,
doesn't it?

737
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:10,070
It does.
But I don't think it hurts to be aware,

738
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:11,903
uh,
so that you don't lapse into being a 

739
00:39:14,241 --> 00:39:16,810
bully for the sake of being a bully.
You know,

740
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,770
I think anybody who has a really hard 
trainer,

741
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,540
uh,
kind of,

742
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:23,570
you know,
comes up against that and my,

743
00:39:23,571 --> 00:39:26,390
a really good trainer or as part of me,
a sadist,

744
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:29,810
and you have to make sure that you don't
become that sadist,

745
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:32,750
but so you're not a monster.
So there you go.

746
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,580
Yeah.
But I worry about it.

747
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:36,200
Well,
that's why you're not,

748
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:39,500
but it's the

749
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,713
being able to explore those 
possibilities and being able to just 

750
00:39:46,341 --> 00:39:51,320
delve into the deep recesses of your 
mind in the interest of creativity.

751
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:52,783
That seems to be,
if anybody's going to appreciate that 

752
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,640
it's going to be creative writers,

753
00:39:55,780 --> 00:40:00,670
but it's not my mind.
I'm delving into the deep recesses,

754
00:40:00,671 --> 00:40:02,620
if I'm lucky,
if I'm doing it right,

755
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:08,340
your mind of something that they'll like
comedians and they'll say,

756
00:40:09,221 --> 00:40:11,050
oh my gosh,
that happened to you too.

757
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:16,830
And a lot of times there are things that
people have never ever talked about.

758
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:20,650
Uh,
I tell a classic anecdote after I'd read

759
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:21,484
the,
uh,

760
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:26,610
the guts story at an event,
a woman came up and uh,

761
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,940
she was a middle aged woman.
She was about my age and she said,

762
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:35,920
I really loved that you read that story 
about how you,

763
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:37,723
uh,

764
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:42,240
got your anus prolapsed while 
masturbating and swimming pool,

765
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:46,740
which is not my story,
but I'm the one that read it.

766
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:47,903
So that's the one,
I'm the one that they're picturing in 

767
00:40:49,981 --> 00:40:53,340
this horrendous situation.
And she says,

768
00:40:53,341 --> 00:40:56,370
since you can tell that story,
I'm going to tell you a story.

769
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:57,953
And she said,
how when,

770
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:02,450
when she was seven years old,
she was in second grade and she was in a

771
00:41:02,451 --> 00:41:07,050
little organization called the brownies,
which is a precursor to the girl scouts.

772
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:09,120
You,
you wear a brown dress,

773
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:12,180
little brown hat,
you get these little merit badges.

774
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:13,913
And she said,
one day I had a stomachache and my mom 

775
00:41:19,381 --> 00:41:23,100
kept me home from school and we had this
heating pad,

776
00:41:23,101 --> 00:41:23,934
it must've been in the 1960s and this 
heating pad had this vibrating function 

777
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:28,883
and she put me face down on this heating
pad on my stomach and I fell asleep and 

778
00:41:32,851 --> 00:41:33,684
while was asleep,
this vibrating warm heating pad must 

779
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:40,760
have slid down between my legs.
She says,

780
00:41:40,761 --> 00:41:41,594
because I woke up with the most amazing 
feeling I feeling like I had never felt 

781
00:41:47,181 --> 00:41:48,920
before.
Oh my God,

782
00:41:48,921 --> 00:41:52,340
it felt so good.
And so

783
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,100
next time it was my turn to host the 
brownies.

784
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:01,150
I said Brownies because you've got to 
try this heating pad.

785
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:02,823
And she says all the brownies,
they turn the heating pad on the 

786
00:42:06,041 --> 00:42:06,874
vibrating heating pad.
And they wrote it like a pony all 

787
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,630
afternoon.
And she said it was like sex in the city

788
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,464
for seven year old girls.
They could not get enough of this 

789
00:42:16,661 --> 00:42:17,494
heating pad.
And they were all riding this heating 

790
00:42:19,271 --> 00:42:21,970
pad and they had a great time.
And she said,

791
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:23,163
and for the first time in my life I was 
the most popular girl in my class and I 

792
00:42:28,151 --> 00:42:30,910
was the girl that all the girls wanted 
to play with.

793
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,313
And for every Brownie troop meeting it 
was at my house and I was the leader 

794
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:42,400
until the day that my mother came home 
from work early and she caught us with a

795
00:42:42,401 --> 00:42:43,234
heating pad and she sent the other 
brownies home and she whipped the cord 

796
00:42:49,241 --> 00:42:49,870
out of the wall.

797
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:50,703
She just ripped it out of the socket and
she started to beat me with it and she 

798
00:42:55,211 --> 00:42:58,030
beat me with that court and she beat me 
and she said,

799
00:42:58,031 --> 00:43:01,450
you fucking piece of shit.
You dirty whore.

800
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:05,050
What kind of a fucking whore am I 
raising you?

801
00:43:05,051 --> 00:43:07,060
Whore.
And she beat me,

802
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:07,963
she beat me.
And she says this woman who's my age 

803
00:43:11,081 --> 00:43:12,910
now,
she says,

804
00:43:12,911 --> 00:43:16,810
I have not had an orgasm since I was 
seven years old.

805
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,473
And then she goes,
but if you can tell that swimming pool 

806
00:43:22,031 --> 00:43:27,031
story about how you got hurt jacking off
underwater,

807
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:29,223
she says,
I can tell my heating pad story and I 

808
00:43:31,751 --> 00:43:34,030
can tell that story until I can make it 
funny.

809
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:37,810
And then maybe somebody I can go back to
my mom and I can say,

810
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:39,123
do you remember that heating pad we used
to have and it'll be complete whole 

811
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:47,020
shit.
And so cc cc,

812
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:48,123
that's what I'm trying to do.
I'm trying to create the opening for 

813
00:43:52,061 --> 00:43:52,894
people to tell these stories that they,
they never thought that they could tell 

814
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:58,383
because that's the way in which they're 
going to resolve these stories and 

815
00:44:01,451 --> 00:44:03,100
they're going to master these stories.

816
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:05,560
We have these,
um,

817
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:07,623
um,
but de toilette things that have a 

818
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:12,460
little button on the wall,
you press it,

819
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:15,610
it shoots hot water up your ass.
And,

820
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:16,444
uh,
my kids come over and did love these 

821
00:44:19,811 --> 00:44:24,280
toilets.
I have two daughters and my youngest,

822
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:25,203
when she was seven,
she would sit on the toilet and she was 

823
00:44:28,001 --> 00:44:33,001
laughing and giggling and we didn't tell
her there's anything wrong with it.

824
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:37,230
So she was telling us how much she loves
it,

825
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:39,810
how much she loves the hot water when it
shoots onto her.

826
00:44:39,811 --> 00:44:42,210
But she was like,
it feels so good.

827
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:43,343
And there was no shame in it.
And there was this weird moment where 

828
00:44:47,281 --> 00:44:50,040
I'm like,
am I supposed to react to this?

829
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:51,840
Am I supposed to say?
Yeah,

830
00:44:51,841 --> 00:44:55,590
I know I like it too.
Am I supposed to say,

831
00:44:55,591 --> 00:44:57,120
Hey,
don't do that too much.

832
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:01,230
Am I supposed to say don't tell anybody 
you like that you can like it,

833
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:02,610
but don't tell anybody you like it.

834
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,850
Like what am I supposed to do?
And uh,

835
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:07,823
I didn't do anything.
I just let her smile and she walked out 

836
00:45:10,561 --> 00:45:14,370
of the bathroom laughing like it was 
great and it was,

837
00:45:14,371 --> 00:45:15,570
no,
there was no issue.

838
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,060
But it was this moment where I was like,
wow,

839
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:19,943
if I was a religious person or a 
suppressive person or some person with 

840
00:45:23,761 --> 00:45:24,594
some sexual issues,
this could be a real problem for this 

841
00:45:27,331 --> 00:45:30,270
little girl.
Instead I was like,

842
00:45:30,271 --> 00:45:31,920
okay,
let's get out of the bathroom now.

843
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:34,500
I guess you're done.
All righty.

844
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:35,663
And she has no idea that this was even 
like a moment of crisis in my mind or I 

845
00:45:43,651 --> 00:45:44,221
was like,
okay,

846
00:45:44,221 --> 00:45:45,054
how do I handle this?
I'm in the bathroom with my seven year 

847
00:45:46,531 --> 00:45:47,364
old daughter,
just can't water shot up her ass and 

848
00:45:48,601 --> 00:45:49,450
she's enjoying it.

849
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:53,880
So you talk about it on the radio,
is that how you deal with that?

850
00:45:53,881 --> 00:45:54,020
Right.

851
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:56,540
Joy to share.
I enjoy too.

852
00:45:56,541 --> 00:45:58,160
We all do.
We talk about these toilets.

853
00:45:58,161 --> 00:46:00,260
They're amazing.
It's warm water.

854
00:46:00,261 --> 00:46:01,550
Choosing your,
it's great.

855
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:02,533
It feels awesome,
but it's not supposed to feel awesome 

856
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,370
for like a little girl for some reason.
Right?

857
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:13,510
See you tell that story and people will 
have so many versions of that story.

858
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:15,290
For me,
I was in Germany.

859
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:19,520
I went in the bathroom in the airport.
I didn't know what this button was,

860
00:46:19,521 --> 00:46:20,354
so I pressed it.
I looked down just in time to see this 

861
00:46:22,251 --> 00:46:23,084
little plastic arm swing out.
I didn't know what that thing was going 

862
00:46:25,881 --> 00:46:26,714
to do,
so I jumped off the head and this thing 

863
00:46:29,181 --> 00:46:30,014
shot up with such force.
It knocked a ceiling panel out of the 

864
00:46:32,931 --> 00:46:37,910
ceiling and all this hot toilet water 
came sprinkling down on me.

865
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,290
Uh,
and I,

866
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,590
that's the only time I've ever been 
around one of those.

867
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:45,590
While we have one here,
if you want to try it out,

868
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:47,780
I don't know.
It scares me.

869
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:50,360
There's two of them.
It's one in that bathroom,

870
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:53,420
one of that one,
one of that bathroom you could lock.

871
00:46:53,870 --> 00:46:54,660
It's private.

872
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:55,493
And see that's my process is you can 
tell these stories and you kind of 

873
00:46:58,471 --> 00:46:59,304
gathered the stories that people tell 
related to these stories and you choose 

874
00:47:02,461 --> 00:47:05,790
the ones that escalate the fastest,
the escalate the best.

875
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:07,013
And that gives you a gradual sort of,
you've established the precedent and 

876
00:47:11,281 --> 00:47:13,650
then something worse,
escalating,

877
00:47:13,651 --> 00:47:14,700
worse,
escalating,

878
00:47:14,701 --> 00:47:15,534
worse,
escalating to the most atrocious or 

879
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,820
extreme version.
And that's what brings a story to crisis

880
00:47:20,821 --> 00:47:21,654
is

881
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:23,963
I,
I have a hard time believing that 

882
00:47:26,621 --> 00:47:29,020
someone would be angry with that woman 
for her story.

883
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,300
You know,
and it's not,

884
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:34,270
it's hard.
It's about her and her story,

885
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:36,460
her relationship to that story.

886
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:41,180
That one you're going to get away with.
You'll get away with that one.

887
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:46,280
The d jerking off the grandfather one is
in a different place.

888
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:49,580
She's because she's a victim of sexual 
abuse.

889
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:53,840
She's a victim of VI.
It's strange that violence,

890
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:54,733
for some reason,
it's more acceptable than sexual abuse 

891
00:47:58,010 --> 00:48:02,270
and a lot of ways sexual abuse seems to 
be transformative.

892
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:05,050
Like there's something about sexual 
abuse that it,

893
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:09,650
it ruins you introduce a,
an experience,

894
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:14,660
a memory into a person's life that ruins
them.

895
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:18,773
This is the rough segue,
but I find with so many beginning 

896
00:48:21,391 --> 00:48:26,391
writers is that they have absolutely no 
capacity to be with tension or suspense.

897
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:33,330
So they might start to create suspense,
but then they'll resolve it instantly.

898
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:34,583
And so the story never really gets off 
the ground because something has 

899
00:48:37,411 --> 00:48:38,244
happened to them,
whether it's violent or whether it's 

900
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:40,763
sexual abuse,
that that makes them cling to a kind of 

901
00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:48,690
calm serenity and that's all they want 
and that's all they ever want.

902
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:50,183
And then writing in a way seems to be a 
way of coaching them back to a greater 

903
00:48:53,911 --> 00:48:56,690
and greater tolerance with the 
unresolved with,

904
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:57,800
with the,
the tense,

905
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:58,770
with suspense

906
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,433
is some of the best moments in books 
that I've read are moments where you're 

907
00:49:02,641 --> 00:49:04,320
reading and you're like,
oh fuck.

908
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:06,550
Like where's this going?
Like,

909
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:09,720
you know,
you're going to get introduced into some

910
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:11,670
really disturbing scene

911
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:14,423
and you have to be with that.
You have to be with that until it's 

912
00:49:16,261 --> 00:49:18,150
resolved.
And that's good writing.

913
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:20,910
You know,
bad writing is where it comes up.

914
00:49:20,911 --> 00:49:21,744
It's resolved.

915
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:23,163
Now when you're in this workshop and 
they're discussing with you this 

916
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:28,713
possibility of censorship of you sell,
censoring or have them not accepting 

917
00:49:32,801 --> 00:49:34,810
your ideas.
Like how do you,

918
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:38,590
how do you debate that with them?
How do you,

919
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:39,790
how do you talk about that?

920
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:44,040
Boy,
there's really no debate,

921
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:46,020
you know?
Ah,

922
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:49,440
and,
and that was another aspect,

923
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:50,483
aspect of the workshop is that we had 
all known each other for so many years 

924
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:54,623
that,
uh,

925
00:49:55,110 --> 00:49:55,943
mmm,

926
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,233
they're really,
we didn't have the freedom to kind of 

927
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:01,800
teach each other or anything new.

928
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:03,730
Um,
yeah.

929
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:05,143
So there was a staleness there too.
We were all kind of hardened into the 

930
00:50:08,031 --> 00:50:09,290
people we were going to be.

931
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:14,040
I just don't understand their argument.
I just don't understand.

932
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,980
If you're going to really paint a 
monster,

933
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:19,390
you have to have monster's actions.
Yeah.

934
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:22,290
They have to be a real monster.
We know of real monsters.

935
00:50:22,291 --> 00:50:23,124
I mean,
it was just some,

936
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:28,670
some guy just got arrested,
some had sex slaves in his basement.

937
00:50:28,671 --> 00:50:31,520
And you know,
you hear about those people and you go,

938
00:50:31,521 --> 00:50:32,271
yeah,
yeah,

939
00:50:32,271 --> 00:50:33,104
they're out there.
There's probably a hundred of them 

940
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:37,550
scattered across the country right now 
where they have a locked basement and we

941
00:50:37,551 --> 00:50:39,920
don't know about it.
Those are real people.

942
00:50:39,921 --> 00:50:40,754
But if you wrote about one of those 
people using real scenes that were 

943
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:47,660
depicted in the news,
you know,

944
00:50:47,661 --> 00:50:52,130
real eyewitness testimony,
real interviews with these monsters,

945
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:56,613
some people would object to that.
But if you're gonna write about a 

946
00:50:59,411 --> 00:51:00,244
monster,
you have to write them in a monstrous 

947
00:51:03,251 --> 00:51:04,084
way.

948
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:06,961
Oh,
I,

949
00:51:06,961 --> 00:51:09,690
I totally agree.
Um,

950
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:13,833
yeah.

951
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:18,230
What are they trying to achieve?
Like I just don't understand what,

952
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:19,810
okay.

953
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:23,980
They might not enjoy what you're doing.
They might not,

954
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:27,160
might not be something that they want to
take in recreationally,

955
00:51:27,161 --> 00:51:30,400
that they want to read your work in that
in that way.

956
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:32,583
But the fact that they don't appreciate 
what you're doing or the fact that they 

957
00:51:34,601 --> 00:51:35,434
don't want you to do what you're doing 
and they didn't want you to bring it to 

958
00:51:37,331 --> 00:51:40,720
the workshop.
Is this a new thing?

959
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,970
This is,
is there a new trend?

960
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:45,031
You know,
it's,

961
00:51:45,031 --> 00:51:48,360
in a way it's a,
it's an ongoing thing for me because,

962
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:50,700
you know,
I've been kicked out of workshops before

963
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:53,940
for just going a little bit too far.
Uh,

964
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:58,500
and uh,
so in a way it's kind of a,

965
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:02,580
it's maybe my goal.
Maybe my goal is to,

966
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:06,600
you know,
always piss off my Beta audience.

967
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:07,993
Um,
as a way of kind of proving that I've 

968
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:11,770
gone too far.
Um,

969
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:12,850
yeah,

970
00:52:12,850 --> 00:52:14,740
too far though,
it's too far.

971
00:52:14,741 --> 00:52:18,220
When you piss off the Alphas,
well not the Betas,

972
00:52:18,610 --> 00:52:19,310
right?
It's,

973
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:20,143
it's,
you go really far when you piss off 

974
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:23,650
Psychos,
when they're like,

975
00:52:23,651 --> 00:52:24,484
Jesus,
man,

976
00:52:24,490 --> 00:52:25,840
the fuck you doing in my brain,

977
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:29,030
you know?
Oh God,

978
00:52:29,031 --> 00:52:31,760
that's another thing not to talk about.
Just keep calling.

979
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:37,640
Oh my books were banned so many places 
and uh,

980
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:41,380
and sometimes I think that maybe that's 
a good thing because they don't,

981
00:52:41,381 --> 00:52:44,870
aren't reaching the psychos.
My books are abandoned prison systems,

982
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:48,260
Watson,
because they are enormously popular.

983
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:49,573
These prison librarians tell me,
but the books are considered way too 

984
00:52:52,221 --> 00:52:55,040
stimulating.
So wow.

985
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:59,150
People in prison cannot read my books.
Oh Holy Shit.

986
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:01,693
All prisons,
I'm don't know if it's all but it's 

987
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:07,100
Texas and a number of other really big 
states.

988
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:10,970
So I dunno,
that's kind of a badge of honor.

989
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:13,723
Yeah.
But it doesn't equate to the like the 

990
00:53:14,631 --> 00:53:16,820
uh,
the mortality of being banned.

991
00:53:16,821 --> 00:53:21,080
Like a how or a tropic of cancer or 
Salman Rushdie.

992
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:22,430
Yeah,
exactly.

993
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:25,920
Yeah.
Oh God.

994
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:28,050
That fucking struggle,
man.

995
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:33,440
The struggle of wanting to express 
yourself as freely as possible,

996
00:53:34,111 --> 00:53:36,810
but being limited even by your own 
peers.

997
00:53:38,330 --> 00:53:39,290
That is,
um,

998
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:43,010
that's unexpected to someone who's in 
the outside of literature.

999
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:44,150
Someone who just reads it.

1000
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,200
Cause it's not in the comedy world what 
is in the comedy world,

1001
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:50,750
but not amongst good comedians.
Well,

1002
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:52,333
another aspect of that is that so often 
people aren't censoring it because it 

1003
00:53:56,091 --> 00:53:56,924
offends them.
They're censoring it because they're 

1004
00:53:58,521 --> 00:54:01,670
afraid it will offend someone.
They know they're doing it.

1005
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:04,670
They're kind of white knighting on 
behalf of someone else.

1006
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:09,340
David Sedaris told me this story about,
uh,

1007
00:54:09,470 --> 00:54:11,170
telling a joke,
uh,

1008
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:12,043
or something very funny about a girl in 
a wheelchair and how he looked out in 

1009
00:54:15,621 --> 00:54:16,454
the audience and no one was laughing.
They were all looking at a girl in a 

1010
00:54:20,481 --> 00:54:23,750
wheelchair.
And the moment she started to laugh,

1011
00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:27,470
the entire audience started to laugh.
Oh yeah.

1012
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:30,710
And so,
so often people in the workshop,

1013
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,980
they might not personally feel offended 
by the word,

1014
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:37,610
but they're thinking how that word might
hurt people.

1015
00:54:37,611 --> 00:54:39,230
They know.
But yeah,

1016
00:54:39,231 --> 00:54:39,920
that's a fact.

1017
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:40,840
Yeah,
that's a,

1018
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:42,560
that's a giant issue in comedy.
If you,

1019
00:54:42,830 --> 00:54:45,590
if someone's telling you a joke of 
someone's on stage talking about someone

1020
00:54:45,591 --> 00:54:48,080
who's fat and there's a fat person in 
the front row,

1021
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:49,970
that joke will bomb.
Yeah.

1022
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:51,920
It just,
yeah.

1023
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:54,260
But that's because people are good 
people overall.

1024
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:55,123
You know,
they recognize that they don't want to 

1025
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:57,853
cause pain.
Another really odd comic David Sedaris 

1026
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,710
story is that he always told me,
uh,

1027
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:07,430
when you're on the road,
don't read from your current book.

1028
00:55:07,431 --> 00:55:08,264
Always read from the next book pieces.
So we have road testing the stories and 

1029
00:55:11,361 --> 00:55:14,630
finding out which ones work and should 
go into the next book.

1030
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:16,813
And in doing so,
he was telling the story about being in 

1031
00:55:18,471 --> 00:55:19,304
this,
uh,

1032
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:20,860
this forensic,
uh,

1033
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:22,600
uh,
laboratory isn't an,

1034
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:23,443
as an autopsy was taking place and this 
autopsy table was adjacent to dis this 

1035
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:29,324
huge indoor window that separated the 
autopsy suite from this lunch room and 

1036
00:55:34,881 --> 00:55:37,100
in the lunch room where the rest of the,
uh,

1037
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:39,380
the forensic staff and they're all 
eating their lunches.

1038
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:44,390
They all had tuna sandwiches and cans of
coke and barbecue potato chips.

1039
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:50,900
And they were watching through the 
window as is absolutely perfect.

1040
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:56,470
12 year old boy was being autopsied and 
just hours before this kid,

1041
00:55:57,261 --> 00:55:59,900
like two hours before this kid had been 
riding his bicycle,

1042
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:01,213
he'd fallen over,
he'd hit his head on the curb and now 

1043
00:56:04,311 --> 00:56:09,311
two hours later he was dead and dead 
without almost a scratch on him.

1044
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:10,633
Just this perfect naked,
dead 12 year old boy on the autopsy 

1045
00:56:15,021 --> 00:56:17,180
table.
And as he,

1046
00:56:17,590 --> 00:56:19,460
the,
the technicians eating their lunch,

1047
00:56:19,970 --> 00:56:24,100
watching it through a window that they 
watch as the,

1048
00:56:24,101 --> 00:56:25,030
uh,
as the,

1049
00:56:25,370 --> 00:56:26,203
uh,
pathologist in sizes around the top of 

1050
00:56:29,801 --> 00:56:31,870
the kid's face at the top of the 
forehead,

1051
00:56:31,871 --> 00:56:32,704
the hairline,
and then peels a face down like peeling 

1052
00:56:36,011 --> 00:56:36,844
an orange peels the entire face off of 
the skull of this little boy and leaves 

1053
00:56:41,591 --> 00:56:45,940
the face around the neck like a mask,
like a rubber mask.

1054
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:47,223
And this exposes this liver colored dark
red musculature of the child's 

1055
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:52,983
underlying face.
And this one guy watching it with a 

1056
00:56:56,891 --> 00:57:00,190
mouthful of tuna sandwich,
he points this out and he says,

1057
00:57:00,191 --> 00:57:02,020
see that?
That there,

1058
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:05,350
that's the color of red that I want to 
paint our rec room.

1059
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:07,263
Holy Shit.
And once the Darice told that story in 

1060
00:57:10,901 --> 00:57:12,610
front of 600 people,

1061
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:14,230
okay,

1062
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:18,550
it was dead silent.
And you could hear people weeping.

1063
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:20,340
Okay?

1064
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:24,360
People were crying and they were hating 
David Sedaris in that moment.

1065
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,560
And so I had to laugh.
I laughed really loud like a donkey.

1066
00:57:29,430 --> 00:57:30,263
And it was amazing how that hatred in 
that auditorium swung from hating David 

1067
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:36,353
who they did not want to hate to hating 
this jackass over here who was actually 

1068
00:57:40,831 --> 00:57:41,664
laughing.
And so I threw myself on the sword for 

1069
00:57:44,131 --> 00:57:47,190
David and that story never went in any 
book.

1070
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:50,233
Wow.
Did the story Naco in any book just 

1071
00:57:52,401 --> 00:57:55,280
because of the reaction by the audience 
or just an uncomfortable moment?

1072
00:57:55,281 --> 00:57:57,440
He just decided he would speak to him 
about it.

1073
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:58,290
No,
I didn't.

1074
00:57:58,290 --> 00:58:00,800
Not afterwards.
It was just such an awkward,

1075
00:58:00,801 --> 00:58:01,634
painful thing.
I would never kind of throw it back in 

1076
00:58:03,081 --> 00:58:04,530
his face.
Right.

1077
00:58:04,670 --> 00:58:05,503
To my knowledge,
that was the only time the story was 

1078
00:58:07,101 --> 00:58:10,570
told to have those like scattered about 
or there this,

1079
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:14,270
are there scenes what you wrote and he 
just sat and looked at him and went,

1080
00:58:14,271 --> 00:58:15,104
no,
I just got to put that one somewhere 

1081
00:58:16,431 --> 00:58:17,360
else.
Oh,

1082
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:22,400
there's that other side jokes that I 
told where I got hist by 800 people.

1083
00:58:22,850 --> 00:58:23,683
And you know,
as you can live through those moments 

1084
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:28,100
when you realize you can live through a 
lot,

1085
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:34,120
if you can be hated by 1100 people at a 
barnes and noble on Union Square.

1086
00:58:34,730 --> 00:58:37,370
Oh yeah.
You can be hated by your mother.

1087
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:38,293
It's okay.
I know when those people come to see 

1088
00:58:40,461 --> 00:58:41,294
you,
how many of those people are fans of 

1089
00:58:41,691 --> 00:58:44,870
literature and how many of those people 
are specifically fans of your work?

1090
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:46,340
Like there's,
there would be a difference.

1091
00:58:46,341 --> 00:58:47,174
Like the,
the people were fans of your work would 

1092
00:58:48,351 --> 00:58:52,160
at least expect some uncomfortable 
moments.

1093
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:53,473
And for the most part they tend to be 
more or less just fans of my work and 

1094
00:58:57,770 --> 00:59:01,280
still still his,
oh yeah.

1095
00:59:01,281 --> 00:59:02,114
But it's again,
they're hissing on behalf of someone 

1096
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:08,690
than I hissing up for themselves.
You know,

1097
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:11,900
I made this horrible cheap shot and they
always knew a cheap shot.

1098
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:15,080
People always know a cheap shot.
I,

1099
00:59:15,081 --> 00:59:15,914
uh,
I was commenting about how in breakfast 

1100
00:59:17,901 --> 00:59:18,734
at tiffany's,
Truman capote had made this observation 

1101
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:26,410
that Americans don't like true beauty,
true classical natural beauty.

1102
00:59:27,290 --> 00:59:31,040
They want to see a very plain person who
has been so groomed.

1103
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:32,023
So exercise,
so made up so style stylized that she 

1104
00:59:35,601 --> 00:59:40,601
can kind of pass as this,
this amazing,

1105
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:41,833
strange beauty.
That's what Americans want because 

1106
00:59:44,601 --> 00:59:47,840
natural classic beauty is not 
egalitarian.

1107
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:50,150
You're either born with it or you're 
not.

1108
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:54,380
They want to see a plain person who has 
been transformed.

1109
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:57,830
And to make my point at the end of the 
story,

1110
00:59:57,831 --> 00:59:59,780
I made a cheap shot.
I said,

1111
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:00,943
and that's why we have Sarah Jessica 
Parker and I said this in New York and 

1112
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:11,023
in New York,
Sarah Jessica Parker is worshipped like 

1113
01:00:13,161 --> 01:00:13,994
a god and that whole crowd hissed and 
booed and did everything but throw 

1114
01:00:20,511 --> 01:00:23,240
excrement at me.
Wow.

1115
01:00:23,270 --> 01:00:27,080
But then later in line,
half of them came up and whispered.

1116
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:28,610
That was really funny.

1117
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:32,930
Yeah,
that's,

1118
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:35,150
well that's one of the things about dark
comedy clubs.

1119
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:37,040
You want them dark?
No,

1120
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:40,040
you don't want everyone illuminated like
the,

1121
01:00:40,041 --> 01:00:41,860
when the,
the crowd is like the one,

1122
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:45,040
this is one of the real issues with 
doing a comedy special is that uh,

1123
01:00:45,070 --> 01:00:47,900
especially the old way they used to do 
them and they still like to light up the

1124
01:00:47,901 --> 01:00:48,734
audience,
which completely changes the dynamic of 

1125
01:00:50,631 --> 01:00:52,700
the,
the room changes,

1126
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:54,530
what you'll laugh and what you won't 
laugh at.

1127
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:56,760
You know,
in a scene like this,

1128
01:00:56,810 --> 01:00:58,580
Erica,
Sarah Jessica Parker joke,

1129
01:00:58,600 --> 01:00:59,433
it's perfect example.
Like you don't want to be caught dead 

1130
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:04,520
being the one person that throws her 
head back and how's it that

1131
01:01:05,690 --> 01:01:08,580
no cheap shots or just to stay away from
them.

1132
01:01:08,970 --> 01:01:10,410
But that's another,
I'll ask you,

1133
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,030
ask you a question.
You know,

1134
01:01:12,031 --> 01:01:12,864
with so many colleges becoming these 
kind of strident safe places to demand 

1135
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:20,250
their own aesthetic,
what is it like doing comedy?

1136
01:01:21,390 --> 01:01:22,210
Well,

1137
01:01:22,210 --> 01:01:27,210
it hasn't changed that much.
People getting a little got a little bit

1138
01:01:27,341 --> 01:01:28,174
more sensitive because they're aware 
that other people were more sensitive 

1139
01:01:32,830 --> 01:01:35,260
without the audiences that come to 
nightclubs,

1140
01:01:35,261 --> 01:01:39,310
which is primarily where I perform with,
I do a theater.

1141
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:40,240
Those people were there to see

1142
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:41,660
May.
So that's,

1143
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:45,270
they're usually pretty loose,
pretty fun.

1144
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:48,150
But if you're in a nightclub,
they're there to see,

1145
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:49,013
especially the comedy store.
I'm one of the good things about the 

1146
01:01:49,891 --> 01:01:53,550
comedy store is there's literally two 
dozen people on the lineup then,

1147
01:01:53,551 --> 01:01:57,960
not necessarily just here at cu.
They're there to see Anthony Jessel neck

1148
01:01:57,961 --> 01:02:01,080
and Chris delea and all these other 
comedians that are also there as well.

1149
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:05,520
So you get a,
a much broader comedy audience,

1150
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:09,600
but their nightclub audiences,
they have a few drinks in them.

1151
01:02:10,290 --> 01:02:12,510
Maybe they smoked a little pot before 
they got there.

1152
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:17,400
Those people there to have a good time.
Colleges are a nightmare now.

1153
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,610
It's a nightmare because it's 
recreational outrage.

1154
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:21,803
It's,
it's kids who have been under the 

1155
01:02:24,211 --> 01:02:25,044
control of their parents for most of 
their life and haven't had their own 

1156
01:02:27,811 --> 01:02:32,811
sovereignty and identity and now they're
free and they are very quick to uh,

1157
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,700
be outraged.

1158
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:37,530
They,
they want a porn out there.

1159
01:02:37,531 --> 01:02:38,364
Moral superiority.
There wasn't virtue signal and every 

1160
01:02:40,051 --> 01:02:40,884
opportunity they want to shut down 
anything to think is air quotes 

1161
01:02:43,741 --> 01:02:44,574
problematic.
They don't want things to go on a bad 

1162
01:02:46,801 --> 01:02:50,640
when they think for some reason that 
comedy should be uplifting and it should

1163
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:53,340
only punch up.
Like I had this conversation once with a

1164
01:02:53,341 --> 01:02:58,341
professor who wrote a book on a comedy 
and he said all great comedy punches up,

1165
01:02:58,471 --> 01:02:59,790
and I said,
that's bullshit.

1166
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:00,953
I said,
one of the greatest bits of all time is 

1167
01:03:01,951 --> 01:03:02,784
Sam kinisons bit about starving children
in Africa about watching those 

1168
01:03:05,701 --> 01:03:08,880
commercials were starving.
Kids are in Africa and you know,

1169
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:11,370
couldn't you please help?
And he goes in,

1170
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,980
you know kinnisons like he just want to 
grab the guy but hey,

1171
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:15,113
why don't you help them?
You're right fucking there or send 

1172
01:03:17,311 --> 01:03:18,540
someone like me.
He goes,

1173
01:03:18,541 --> 01:03:20,490
send something like me was going to take
these people go,

1174
01:03:20,491 --> 01:03:23,190
hey,
we just drove here 5,000 miles with your

1175
01:03:23,191 --> 01:03:27,360
food and it occurred to us you wouldn't 
be world hunger if you people would live

1176
01:03:27,361 --> 01:03:30,450
her the fucking food as he goes.
Can I hear you say that?

1177
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:33,330
That sand,
we got sand in America too.

1178
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:36,490
We just don't live in it,
asshole and he's done.

1179
01:03:36,570 --> 01:03:37,403
He goes in,
one of the greatest bits of all time is 

1180
01:03:40,081 --> 01:03:40,980
literally about

1181
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:42,313
starving babies in Africa.
It's one of the greatest bits of all 

1182
01:03:45,861 --> 01:03:48,290
time.
And he didn't have anything to say.

1183
01:03:48,410 --> 01:03:49,790
He didn't know where to go with it.
I'm like,

1184
01:03:49,791 --> 01:03:50,624
don't,
don't say comedy is only about punching 

1185
01:03:53,061 --> 01:03:54,440
up.
That's crazy talk.

1186
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:56,870
That's what you're doing is you're f 
there's,

1187
01:03:56,980 --> 01:03:57,813
there's this moral thing that they're 
trying to achieve that literally is 

1188
01:04:03,051 --> 01:04:08,051
completely independent of humor.
It's not what's funny.

1189
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:13,360
It's like there they want to,
they want it to be a multipurpose tool.

1190
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:14,933
Hmm.
They want it to be funny as well as 

1191
01:04:17,061 --> 01:04:17,894
morally uplifting and great for people 
who are discriminated against and 

1192
01:04:22,581 --> 01:04:23,414
amazing for folks who are marginalized 
and uplifting for those who are 

1193
01:04:26,661 --> 01:04:28,910
disenfranchised.
Well that's not what comedy is.

1194
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:30,093
Comedy is funny.
Those things are wonderful and if you 

1195
01:04:33,261 --> 01:04:38,210
want to do a spoken word show or poetry 
or writing or you know,

1196
01:04:38,211 --> 01:04:41,120
a one person play those,
those are great.

1197
01:04:41,630 --> 01:04:44,720
But that's not funny.
Comedy is funny.

1198
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,033
So it's either funny or it's not funny 
and some things are funny that are 

1199
01:04:49,551 --> 01:04:51,560
fucked up.
You know?

1200
01:04:51,561 --> 01:04:52,394
Kennison had a bit about homosexual 
necrophilia acts or paying money to 

1201
01:04:56,181 --> 01:04:59,930
spend a few hours undisturbed with the 
freshest male corpses.

1202
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:01,093
And He,
so he had lied down on his stomach and 

1203
01:05:02,301 --> 01:05:03,350
he goes,
you imagine these people,

1204
01:05:03,351 --> 01:05:04,184
they're on the slabs are like well,
went through life and had a good time 

1205
01:05:07,341 --> 01:05:10,290
and everything and now I guess I'm going
to go and be with Jesus and

1206
01:05:10,470 --> 01:05:12,900
Hey,
what the hell is this?

1207
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:15,810
And he's rocking back and forth.
It feels like some guy's got his dick in

1208
01:05:15,811 --> 01:05:16,644
my ass.
You mean life keeps fucking with they 

1209
01:05:18,431 --> 01:05:21,220
ass even after you're dead.
It never ends.

1210
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:22,540
It never ends.

1211
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:26,890
You would close on it cause it was that 
he couldn't follow it.

1212
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:28,083
Who was such a powerful bit.
It was about a dead guy getting fucked 

1213
01:05:30,101 --> 01:05:30,934
in the ass.
There is no further down that you could 

1214
01:05:33,451 --> 01:05:36,580
punch other than starving babies in 
Africa.

1215
01:05:37,290 --> 01:05:38,800
You know,
and I'm not sure about it,

1216
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:39,634
this is punching down,
but do you remember the s the routine 

1217
01:05:43,211 --> 01:05:44,044
that kind of put Whoopi Goldberg on the 
map a million years ago about being a 

1218
01:05:47,591 --> 01:05:49,720
black surfer chick?
No.

1219
01:05:49,930 --> 01:05:50,651
Oh,
you know,

1220
01:05:50,651 --> 01:05:51,484
she did it on television.
I must've seen it on cable when I was 

1221
01:05:54,041 --> 01:05:58,330
like 19 years old,
but she talks in valley speak.

1222
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:00,520
Nobody's seen this will be person 
before.

1223
01:06:00,730 --> 01:06:02,950
She's brand new.
Nobody's ever seen her on television and

1224
01:06:02,951 --> 01:06:05,290
she's got this funny name and she's 
doing this.

1225
01:06:05,291 --> 01:06:06,124
Val speak about being the only black 
surfer chick on the beach and she loves 

1226
01:06:09,491 --> 01:06:12,280
surfing and she loves this one white 
surfer guy.

1227
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:13,113
And she finally hooks up with them and 
then she realized that she's pregnant 

1228
01:06:16,150 --> 01:06:18,310
and it's all very funny.
The whole front end,

1229
01:06:18,311 --> 01:06:23,311
you're just roaring with laughter and 
then she's pregnant and she doesn't know

1230
01:06:23,411 --> 01:06:28,060
what to do.
So she gets a rusty wire coat hanger and

1231
01:06:28,061 --> 01:06:28,894
she goes into a public bathroom on the 
beach and she gives herself a coat 

1232
01:06:33,401 --> 01:06:34,234
hanger abortion and it spills out there 
on the concrete floor and everything's 

1233
01:06:41,201 --> 01:06:42,034
okay.
And now I'm back on the beach and I'm 

1234
01:06:43,961 --> 01:06:44,794
just doing fine.
And why don't you come on down and see 

1235
01:06:46,931 --> 01:06:48,910
me here on the beach?
It's great down here.

1236
01:06:48,911 --> 01:06:51,500
It's great.
Holy Shit.

1237
01:06:51,510 --> 01:06:56,350
It's a fantastic piece.
And she did it on television and she did

1238
01:06:56,351 --> 01:07:00,850
it on tv and it started so light,
like an IRA,

1239
01:07:00,851 --> 01:07:03,670
11 novel,
and then I went to such a dark,

1240
01:07:03,671 --> 01:07:08,380
horrible place and then it came up with 
just this kind of token.

1241
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:13,330
Everything is okay ending every I'm 
going to be all right,

1242
01:07:13,390 --> 01:07:14,223
don't worry.
This is just something that happened to 

1243
01:07:19,070 --> 01:07:21,490
do that.
It just leaves you shaken.

1244
01:07:22,450 --> 01:07:25,570
And that's the kind of comedy I love.
Yeah,

1245
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:27,033
it goes to the dark or that sentimental 
place and it breaks your heart and then 

1246
01:07:31,721 --> 01:07:36,721
it kind of comes out of it a little bit,
but I were 11 to that so.

1247
01:07:36,791 --> 01:07:39,880
Well,
Nora Ephron in her books,

1248
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:42,450
she was so good at doing that.
Uh,

1249
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:46,330
heartburn.
Heartburn is fantastically funny,

1250
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:49,510
but by the end you're just weeping.
The book is so sad,

1251
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:52,570
but these are moments that if you're 
going to,

1252
01:07:53,810 --> 01:07:56,210
you're going to censor people.
If you're going to self censor,

1253
01:07:56,211 --> 01:07:58,520
if you're going to decide the people 
can't use certain words,

1254
01:07:59,290 --> 01:08:00,123
have you going to decide the certain 
scenarios are just too upsetting for 

1255
01:08:02,151 --> 01:08:03,170
the,
the reader,

1256
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:06,770
the these words are going to,
these moments are going to be harder and

1257
01:08:06,771 --> 01:08:09,610
harder to achieve and these are the 
moments that we're going to talk about.

1258
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:11,450
Like if you and I,
we were in here,

1259
01:08:11,451 --> 01:08:14,120
if we were in a bar somewhere and we're 
having a few drinks,

1260
01:08:14,121 --> 01:08:18,500
talking about great are great moments.
These are the moments we would bring up.

1261
01:08:18,530 --> 01:08:23,530
These are the impactful things that 
saying that Sarah Jessica Parker joke in

1262
01:08:23,691 --> 01:08:26,530
front of those thousand people and 
they're booing and hissing and you were,

1263
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:29,030
you're literally on fire under your skin

1264
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:31,730
and you're beating yourself up 
viciously.

1265
01:08:31,731 --> 01:08:32,750
Like,
why did I say that?

1266
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:35,120
I'm such a jerk.
I didn't need to say that.

1267
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:38,960
That was just cruel and thoughtless and 
yeah,

1268
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:42,830
but if you said that exact same joke and
it killed,

1269
01:08:43,910 --> 01:08:48,110
I'd still kind of beat myself up.
Right.

1270
01:08:48,111 --> 01:08:49,280
You'd be like,
who is awful?

1271
01:08:49,281 --> 01:08:52,580
People that are laughing at this 
unfortunate girl.

1272
01:08:52,790 --> 01:08:56,420
Do you think that the reason why people 
love the transformation thing is because

1273
01:08:56,421 --> 01:09:01,421
it almost like if everyone feels like 
they have a chance instead of like,

1274
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:03,250
that's exactly what it is.
Yeah.

1275
01:09:03,350 --> 01:09:06,110
That you can be,
you don't have to be born with it.

1276
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:08,420
Right.
You have a chance of attaining it.

1277
01:09:09,890 --> 01:09:11,660
Yeah.
Yeah.

1278
01:09:11,661 --> 01:09:12,980
The unfairness.

1279
01:09:13,970 --> 01:09:14,400
Yeah.

1280
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:17,640
The,
that is just the reality of life.

1281
01:09:17,730 --> 01:09:18,563
You know,
one of the things that Jordan talks 

1282
01:09:19,171 --> 01:09:21,570
about all the time is the equality of 
outcome.

1283
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:22,853
That the,
the,

1284
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:26,130
the,
this idea of equality of outcome is,

1285
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:28,620
it's absurd.
It's never going to happen.

1286
01:09:28,621 --> 01:09:30,210
It's not,
it's not what life is.

1287
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:31,133
Life is not about equality of outcome.
It doesn't happen that way because not 

1288
01:09:33,570 --> 01:09:34,403
everyone's willing to put the same 
effort in and not everyone's given the 

1289
01:09:37,351 --> 01:09:37,560
same

1290
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:40,230
tools at birth.
And you know,

1291
01:09:40,231 --> 01:09:41,064
you've gotta be a little careful too,
or you fall into that Jay gatsby trap 

1292
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:45,383
where you get exactly what you wanted 
when you were four or 14 years old and 

1293
01:09:49,981 --> 01:09:50,761
you realize,
oh,

1294
01:09:50,761 --> 01:09:54,780
this is not an adult's dream.
This is a dream of a child.

1295
01:09:55,830 --> 01:09:57,800
It's one of the things that is 
interesting.

1296
01:09:57,801 --> 01:09:57,850
Yeah.

1297
01:09:57,850 --> 01:09:58,683
About your current situation.
And one of the things that I've read 

1298
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:02,793
about your take on it,
I don't know how much you want to go 

1299
01:10:05,051 --> 01:10:06,700
into this,
but you got ripped off.

1300
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:12,020
I got embezzled,
which is a word I can now spell.

1301
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:15,800
Um,
was it someone you trusted?

1302
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:16,730
It was,
it was,

1303
01:10:16,731 --> 01:10:17,564
uh,
the accountant for the agency that 

1304
01:10:19,131 --> 01:10:19,964
represented my work.
And this is a man who had worked with 

1305
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:23,293
for almost 20,
21 years and one of my favorite people 

1306
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:30,350
in my professional life.
Fuck.

1307
01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:31,263
Oh.

1308
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:32,633
And

1309
01:10:33,670 --> 01:10:35,590
what I thought was interesting was your 
take on it.

1310
01:10:35,591 --> 01:10:36,424
I mean,
the whole thing is horrific and 

1311
01:10:37,061 --> 01:10:38,140
everyone's worst nightmare.

1312
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:40,211
Uh,
you know,

1313
01:10:40,211 --> 01:10:41,920
who,
who trust people with their money.

1314
01:10:42,430 --> 01:10:44,520
But what was interesting is you,

1315
01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:48,010
you decided that there's some merit to 
this.

1316
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:49,293
There's some benefit to this,
that this is going to make you hungry 

1317
01:10:51,281 --> 01:10:51,830
again.

1318
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:55,670
This is like you have to work now.
And also that,

1319
01:10:55,671 --> 01:10:56,504
uh,
that I have been really poor in my life 

1320
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:01,820
and it was never my goal to be really 
rich.

1321
01:11:01,850 --> 01:11:04,430
It was never my goal to have money.
It was my goal to be a writer.

1322
01:11:04,910 --> 01:11:09,910
It was my goal to be able to write books
for a living and I can still do that.

1323
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:12,350
You know,
I've been poor.

1324
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:16,410
Poor is not something I'm afraid of.
Uh,

1325
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:19,140
as long as I can write books,
I'll be a happy person.

1326
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:21,090
You had to be rich and to not be 
creative.

1327
01:11:21,091 --> 01:11:25,620
Like as if you know people.
You sure does.

1328
01:11:25,710 --> 01:11:26,543
He go to those parties as rich people 
parties and all they have to talk about 

1329
01:11:29,941 --> 01:11:34,880
is their servants is I hate my maid,
I hate my gardener.

1330
01:11:34,950 --> 01:11:36,760
We Ha we have this new person to do 
that,

1331
01:11:36,761 --> 01:11:37,594
this and they're doing a lousy job and 
all they have to talk about in their 

1332
01:11:40,411 --> 01:11:44,190
lives is their household help.
I hate those parties

1333
01:11:44,390 --> 01:11:47,240
or objects or objects.
Yeah.

1334
01:11:47,270 --> 01:11:48,103
There was a guy that used to live down 
the street from as to call them bling 

1335
01:11:49,431 --> 01:11:52,250
bling because every conversation that I 
would have with them,

1336
01:11:52,310 --> 01:11:54,320
it would eventually be like,
uh,

1337
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:55,520
yeah,
look at this new car.

1338
01:11:55,521 --> 01:11:57,200
God,
where'd you get that watch?

1339
01:11:57,210 --> 01:11:58,340
Or,
you know,

1340
01:11:58,341 --> 01:11:59,174
w w what kind of car you drive it and 
like we didn't know is what did you do 

1341
01:12:01,190 --> 01:12:02,390
to the house?
You got a new sank,

1342
01:12:02,450 --> 01:12:03,470
you know,
it's got a new TV,

1343
01:12:03,471 --> 01:12:04,070
which,
which,

1344
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:06,710
which size did you get?
It was always objects.

1345
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:08,900
It was always things,
you know,

1346
01:12:08,901 --> 01:12:12,700
he was just this strange guy that was 
just working for things.

1347
01:12:14,060 --> 01:12:16,330
Uh,
the same things that everybody else has

1348
01:12:16,430 --> 01:12:19,540
working for.
Just a different combination of things.

1349
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:20,990
But it's a game,
you know,

1350
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:23,270
trying to accumulate points in the game,
you know,

1351
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:25,490
and because these things are difficult 
to achieve,

1352
01:12:25,790 --> 01:12:26,623
then they become attractive and then 
they become the main focus because it's 

1353
01:12:29,901 --> 01:12:32,450
hard to get a Bentley.
You got to save up a lot of money to get

1354
01:12:32,451 --> 01:12:33,620
a Bentley.
You know,

1355
01:12:33,621 --> 01:12:35,420
how much those costs,
which model is that?

1356
01:12:35,690 --> 01:12:37,460
Is that the one with the delay?
We'll look at,

1357
01:12:37,461 --> 01:12:38,294
you got the perforated leather seats,
that's extra expensive and then this 

1358
01:12:41,211 --> 01:12:43,700
becomes the main goal.
Yeah.

1359
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:49,480
But so many people fall into that 
bizarre trial says such a strange common

1360
01:12:49,911 --> 01:12:50,460
trap.

1361
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:51,120
Well,
you know,

1362
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:53,580
but it's the only trap that we kind of 
have.

1363
01:12:53,850 --> 01:12:57,210
You are not really trained to again go 
to that,

1364
01:12:57,750 --> 01:12:59,610
uh,
that place of,

1365
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:01,800
of wanting to,
you know,

1366
01:13:02,190 --> 01:13:06,870
learn something to wanting to create 
something to apprentice yourself,

1367
01:13:07,170 --> 01:13:10,800
to somebody who creates the thing that 
you dream of creating.

1368
01:13:11,010 --> 01:13:11,843
It's much easier to kind of fall into 
the readymade trap of these things are 

1369
01:13:15,361 --> 01:13:19,230
for sale and the people who sell them,
we'll treat you really nice.

1370
01:13:20,030 --> 01:13:20,863
You go into their showroom and they will
treat you so nice and you are always 

1371
01:13:23,551 --> 01:13:24,384
welcomed there and uh,
and you can have a way of kind of 

1372
01:13:27,910 --> 01:13:31,530
signaling that you've accomplished 
something in a very public way.

1373
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:32,670
Yeah.
It's much,

1374
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:33,504
much harder to apprentice yourself and 
to sit down and do those 10,000 million 

1375
01:13:36,961 --> 01:13:38,730
words or to,
you know,

1376
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:39,833
paint those pictures or whatever,
build those brick walls and really 

1377
01:13:43,350 --> 01:13:47,640
develop the pride of a skill.
Yeah.

1378
01:13:47,850 --> 01:13:49,140
I mean the,
the,

1379
01:13:49,710 --> 01:13:50,920
the privates Gillen,

1380
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:52,033
the knowledge that your,
your discipline and your focus allows 

1381
01:13:56,391 --> 01:14:00,170
you to achieve these works at these 
things when they're done.

1382
01:14:00,171 --> 01:14:01,940
I mean,
what does that feeling of satisfaction?

1383
01:14:01,941 --> 01:14:05,450
Like when you touch the back cover of a 
book for the first time and it's over.

1384
01:14:06,070 --> 01:14:07,030
No,
that's nothing.

1385
01:14:07,031 --> 01:14:07,864
That's nothing compared to when you hear
it echoed in the culture and you hear 

1386
01:14:11,501 --> 01:14:16,501
people pick up the word snowflake and 
you hear all these people say,

1387
01:14:16,511 --> 01:14:21,511
the first rule of blank is when you 
realize that you've kind of dictated the

1388
01:14:24,131 --> 01:14:28,390
semantics of the culture for a period 
that feels like power.

1389
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:29,800
That is,
uh,

1390
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:31,053
that's glorious.
When you found out that this guy ripped 

1391
01:14:35,591 --> 01:14:36,424
you off,

1392
01:14:37,650 --> 01:14:40,680
we shocked.
Did you have suspicions before this?

1393
01:14:41,130 --> 01:14:41,970
I had no,
no,

1394
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:42,893
almost a year before.
So you had an idea for a year and then 

1395
01:14:47,311 --> 01:14:49,690
it was confirmed.
It was finally what,

1396
01:14:49,830 --> 01:14:51,720
what happened,
you know,

1397
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:56,790
a year ago I was supposed to start 
receiving some significant payments from

1398
01:14:56,791 --> 01:14:57,624
this year's book and they never came 
through and they still never came 

1399
01:15:00,271 --> 01:15:02,730
through.
And every time I requested them,

1400
01:15:02,970 --> 01:15:04,800
the publisher said that they'd been 
paid.

1401
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:06,293
But the accountant said that there were 
technical difficulties with wiring me 

1402
01:15:09,971 --> 01:15:14,280
the money or he had personal problems in
his life caring for his mother.

1403
01:15:14,730 --> 01:15:17,700
And so there was always some reason why 
the money never came through.

1404
01:15:18,510 --> 01:15:19,630
And finally,
um,

1405
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:21,293
I kind of,
I told my agent I didn't want to do any 

1406
01:15:22,681 --> 01:15:24,990
more deals until we had this money thing
resolved.

1407
01:15:25,710 --> 01:15:27,960
And at that point,
the accountant,

1408
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:29,173
uh,
made a videotaped confession and his 

1409
01:15:31,461 --> 01:15:33,280
sense of pled guilty,
uh,

1410
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:35,850
and I believe his sentencing is it going
to be in November.

1411
01:15:36,450 --> 01:15:39,720
Um,
but according to the district attorney,

1412
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:42,450
they can't seem to find any of the 
money.

1413
01:15:43,050 --> 01:15:47,310
So the money seems to be gone.
Kamasi's still,

1414
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:49,650
you know,
it's kind of up in the air.

1415
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:50,513
It's a,
initially they said it was 3.5 million 

1416
01:15:53,610 --> 01:15:56,310
and now they're saying it could be as 
much as 25 million.

1417
01:15:56,970 --> 01:15:59,910
And this is from not just me,
this is from Mario Puzo,

1418
01:15:59,911 --> 01:16:01,920
his estate.
The man that wrote the Godfather,

1419
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:05,940
this is from a lot of different estates.
The agency handled the estate of,

1420
01:16:06,380 --> 01:16:07,213
of uh,
Lillian Hellman and Jacquelynne Susanne 

1421
01:16:09,870 --> 01:16:11,880
and a lot of very big,
big writers.

1422
01:16:12,090 --> 01:16:13,470
Uh,
Edward Gorey,

1423
01:16:13,471 --> 01:16:16,020
he wrote those creepy,
wonderful cartoon books.

1424
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:18,240
Uh,
a lot of different writers,

1425
01:16:18,241 --> 01:16:19,980
a lot of different estates.
Lost money.

1426
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:21,053
So it was this guy doing this from the 
jump or does this somewhere along the 

1427
01:16:23,521 --> 01:16:27,270
line he lost his mind and nobody really 
knows.

1428
01:16:27,570 --> 01:16:28,890
Yeah.
Wow.

1429
01:16:30,270 --> 01:16:33,210
Jamie,
can you hit that pause button while I go

1430
01:16:33,211 --> 01:16:33,940
out and take a leak?

1431
01:16:33,940 --> 01:16:35,700
Just gone take a leak.
Oh,

1432
01:16:35,701 --> 01:16:37,620
thank God.
[inaudible] don't worry about it man.

1433
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,440
I know it's rough.
Um,

1434
01:16:40,470 --> 01:16:44,010
get used to it though.
What are we anywhere close to?

1435
01:16:44,011 --> 01:16:45,620
Three 30.
We know it's,

1436
01:16:45,690 --> 01:16:47,610
it's two 30 but we can end anytime you'd
like.

1437
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:49,530
No,
three 30th kind of my uh,

1438
01:16:49,770 --> 01:16:50,940
drop dead.
Okay.

1439
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,230
Bye.
I'll be right back.

1440
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:54,490
Okay.
Uh,

1441
01:16:54,510 --> 01:16:56,640
Neil degrasse Tyson's here.
Ladies and gentlemen.

1442
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:58,470
He's waiting.
He got here way early though,

1443
01:16:58,471 --> 01:16:59,304
right?
Yeah.

1444
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:01,340
That was the plan.
He has got some work to do before.

1445
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:02,213
Oh,
okay.

1446
01:17:02,610 --> 01:17:05,040
He's probably in the tank right now.
I hope.

1447
01:17:05,910 --> 01:17:07,050
Student tents,
right?

1448
01:17:07,110 --> 01:17:08,850
Yeah.
Can't believe I fucked up that original.

1449
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:09,471
Yeah.
Sorry.

1450
01:17:09,471 --> 01:17:10,040
I was trying to look

1451
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:12,260
to see if anyone else,
but man,

1452
01:17:12,261 --> 01:17:13,910
I really thought it was attributed to 
him,

1453
01:17:15,350 --> 01:17:16,730
but that's me.
Oh,

1454
01:17:16,970 --> 01:17:19,340
my fucked up brain.
He's intense though.

1455
01:17:20,230 --> 01:17:22,280
Kind of creeps me out with the intensity
a little bit.

1456
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:24,790
What do you think about some of these 
shifts,

1457
01:17:24,791 --> 01:17:26,710
these written like guts?
Yeah.

1458
01:17:26,830 --> 01:17:28,090
You know,
choke.

1459
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:29,810
Yeah.
A couple other ones.

1460
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:31,520
What was the one where,
uh,

1461
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:33,770
someone turn into a Werewolf on an 
airplane?

1462
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:38,520
I think that was from his,
uh,

1463
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:41,790
collection of horror stories.
The one,

1464
01:17:41,791 --> 01:17:46,791
the alien on the cover.
The,

1465
01:17:47,130 --> 01:17:50,250
the process though,
it's like survivor.

1466
01:17:50,490 --> 01:17:55,490
He's so perfectly designed for being a 
writer,

1467
01:17:56,190 --> 01:17:57,390
you know,
like this,

1468
01:17:57,420 --> 01:17:58,253
one of the more fascinating things about
this podcast is getting to pick the 

1469
01:18:00,241 --> 01:18:01,074
brain of someone like him and however,
when would you ever have two plus hours 

1470
01:18:06,991 --> 01:18:11,991
to sit down with a guy like that and 
just find out how he thinks about shit?

1471
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:14,160
Like,
fuck,

1472
01:18:14,230 --> 01:18:15,063
I mean,
who is it?

1473
01:18:15,330 --> 01:18:16,163
You know how he,
he's never going to let you in like 

1474
01:18:18,391 --> 01:18:19,224
that.
This is one of the weirder things about 

1475
01:18:20,941 --> 01:18:24,300
podcasts is that for three hours,
whatever the time is,

1476
01:18:24,570 --> 01:18:26,490
the phones go away.
You're,

1477
01:18:26,550 --> 01:18:27,383
you're wearing headsets,
which I try to encourage people to wear 

1478
01:18:29,281 --> 01:18:30,870
it now because for awhile I was like,
yeah,

1479
01:18:30,871 --> 01:18:31,830
do whatever you want.

1480
01:18:31,830 --> 01:18:34,920
But there's something about the headset 
that locks you in.

1481
01:18:35,490 --> 01:18:39,640
Your voice is exactly the same level of 
sound as my voices.

1482
01:18:39,670 --> 01:18:42,930
Cause there it's all coming through the 
headsets so it's all combined.

1483
01:18:43,650 --> 01:18:46,650
So you're much more aware of talking 
over each other and shit like that.

1484
01:18:46,651 --> 01:18:47,484
But you're also much more aware.
There's nothing else going on that the 

1485
01:18:50,881 --> 01:18:52,860
sound of your voices,
it's,

1486
01:18:52,950 --> 01:18:53,783
it's by isolating,
by putting the headset on and or 

1487
01:18:56,110 --> 01:18:58,440
eliminating the outside noise,
you would never be able to,

1488
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:00,840
you'd never be able to have a 
conversation with a guy like that.

1489
01:19:01,540 --> 01:19:04,440
Like that's gotten this deep into the 
game.

1490
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:07,010
Just the,
that's what I was going to hit.

1491
01:19:07,011 --> 01:19:08,850
The depth,
the depth of everything.

1492
01:19:09,010 --> 01:19:09,843
Yes.
Background in journalism is probably 

1493
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:15,430
where that's coming from.
But his appreciation for darkness too.

1494
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:16,283
Yeah.
Like his appreciation for that story of 

1495
01:19:18,451 --> 01:19:20,070
the little girl jerk and the GRANDPA.

1496
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:21,233
Fuck Dude.
It's a always back gotta stop talking 

1497
01:19:25,081 --> 01:19:27,360
Shit about them.
Feel better.

1498
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:33,000
Some of this podcast makes people p 
tricky on his coffee.

1499
01:19:33,270 --> 01:19:34,103
That's it too.
I've developed a superhuman bladder 

1500
01:19:36,540 --> 01:19:40,020
occasionally though.
I have to get up occasionally.

1501
01:19:40,830 --> 01:19:43,170
Um,
so back to this dude ripping you off,

1502
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:46,140
this guy who is your friend.
Um,

1503
01:19:46,890 --> 01:19:51,750
so they don't know where the fuck the 
money is and now they don't and he's not

1504
01:19:51,751 --> 01:19:53,370
talking,
you know,

1505
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:54,953
uh,
I guess he hasn't really talked about 

1506
01:19:55,981 --> 01:19:56,814
where the money has gone.
At first they thought there was some 

1507
01:19:58,081 --> 01:20:00,930
dummy corporations and they could 
recover the money.

1508
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:02,393
So we were all looking for a big payday,
but now the DA says they cannot the 

1509
01:20:07,261 --> 01:20:08,094
money

1510
01:20:08,610 --> 01:20:10,990
and he doesn't want to talk.
Uh,

1511
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:13,260
or he's saying the money is spent.
I'm not sure.

1512
01:20:13,290 --> 01:20:15,030
Don't you want to torture him?
No,

1513
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,910
I don't.
Don't you want someone to torture him?

1514
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:19,830
No,
but it's so sweet.

1515
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:21,413
It's so sweet because I've had readers,
readers offer the torture him to kill 

1516
01:20:26,611 --> 01:20:29,100
him and they say they'll do it free of 
charge.

1517
01:20:29,101 --> 01:20:31,590
So apparently these are people who kind 
of do it for a living.

1518
01:20:31,890 --> 01:20:33,810
Yeah.
So damn,

1519
01:20:34,950 --> 01:20:37,380
I need to make a list.
Okay.

1520
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:38,253
Like me to get some free killings.
It's going to have to be some people I 

1521
01:20:40,351 --> 01:20:42,870
really don't like,
but you want the money first.

1522
01:20:43,050 --> 01:20:43,883
You don't want to just kill some money,
want to make sure you get that money 

1523
01:20:45,361 --> 01:20:46,194
first.
Otherwise it's sitting in coffee cans 

1524
01:20:47,101 --> 01:20:48,990
buried in the Nevada desert.
You know,

1525
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:51,600
I really,
between you and me,

1526
01:20:51,630 --> 01:20:52,710
I really don't care.

1527
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:53,850
Really.
No.

1528
01:20:54,330 --> 01:20:54,840
You know,
I'm,

1529
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:56,850
I really am.
Seriously not somebody,

1530
01:20:57,090 --> 01:20:59,370
it would've given me a little more 
wiggle room.

1531
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:02,460
I wouldn't be writing so frantically on 
the next book,

1532
01:21:02,970 --> 01:21:06,060
I could maybe take a little time off and
I don't know,

1533
01:21:06,061 --> 01:21:09,060
relax.
But you know,

1534
01:21:09,061 --> 01:21:11,760
this is what I do.
And so what the hell?

1535
01:21:12,150 --> 01:21:13,170
Yeah.
You have your health,

1536
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:17,160
you have a million ideas,
great ideas,

1537
01:21:17,430 --> 01:21:20,670
a great profession that you love.
You're involved in it right now.

1538
01:21:20,671 --> 01:21:22,800
Currently I'm,
we're in the process,

1539
01:21:22,890 --> 01:21:25,710
all these projects and so,
you know,

1540
01:21:25,770 --> 01:21:28,320
I haven't really lost any of the things 
that I really love.

1541
01:21:28,830 --> 01:21:29,850
You know,
my dad is dead,

1542
01:21:29,851 --> 01:21:32,730
my mother's dead.
And I think after your parents are dead,

1543
01:21:33,150 --> 01:21:36,480
there's not a lot that can hurt you that
much except,

1544
01:21:36,530 --> 01:21:38,220
you know,
of course the death of a child.

1545
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,110
And so,
you know,

1546
01:21:40,111 --> 01:21:40,980
you're kind of,
uh,

1547
01:21:41,490 --> 01:21:45,540
uh,
bulletproof after those things.

1548
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:46,913
Well,
the real issue that happens with 

1549
01:21:48,571 --> 01:21:50,430
successful people is they lose their 
hunger,

1550
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:51,570
right?
They lose that.

1551
01:21:51,590 --> 01:21:54,150
It's,
it's a death sentence for comedians.

1552
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:55,253
One of the things that happens with 
comedians is the early specials tend to 

1553
01:21:57,631 --> 01:21:58,464
be really good,
and then the later specials tend to be 

1554
01:22:00,301 --> 01:22:01,134
really bad.
And it's because these people are now 

1555
01:22:04,170 --> 01:22:08,370
super wealthy and coddled and there's no
danger in their life and there's no,

1556
01:22:08,730 --> 01:22:11,790
no real risk or challenges and there's 
no growing or learning.

1557
01:22:12,180 --> 01:22:15,780
Everything is just like performing to 
people that adore you.

1558
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:18,990
Another aspect,
and I talk about this more and more with

1559
01:22:19,530 --> 01:22:20,490
writers,
I know,

1560
01:22:21,150 --> 01:22:23,820
is it when you're starting out,
you've got a lot of downtime,

1561
01:22:23,821 --> 01:22:26,460
a lot of daydreaming,
daydreaming time,

1562
01:22:26,461 --> 01:22:31,461
a lot of slack on structured time,
but the more successful you become,

1563
01:22:32,401 --> 01:22:36,330
the more your time is really scheduled 
and you just don't have those.

1564
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:41,130
I'm really bored times when you tend to 
come up with fantastic ideas,

1565
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:42,593
and so in a way,
being somewhat poor again gives me 

1566
01:22:46,321 --> 01:22:47,154
those,
does really slack times when the ideas 

1567
01:22:49,201 --> 01:22:52,230
occur.
That makes a lot of sense.

1568
01:22:52,950 --> 01:22:53,790
Yeah.
Um,

1569
01:22:54,270 --> 01:22:56,670
again to bring back to Comedians,
Comedians,

1570
01:22:56,671 --> 01:22:57,420
uh,
they'll,

1571
01:22:57,420 --> 01:23:01,050
they get movie careers and it's another 
death sentence for their comedy.

1572
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:03,570
They start doing movies,
they're on sets all day,

1573
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:07,240
they're constantly working and then you 
don't have enough time to concentrate on

1574
01:23:07,241 --> 01:23:08,074
your standup and you have zero fuck 
around time cause you're just doing 

1575
01:23:11,591 --> 01:23:14,320
things all day.
You lose that.

1576
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:18,610
This is weird namedrop be Brad Pitt 
advice.

1577
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:20,073
Brad Pitt told me,
Brad Pitt said that success is actually 

1578
01:23:25,031 --> 01:23:25,864
one of the failure is actually one of 
the best things that can happen because 

1579
01:23:29,201 --> 01:23:32,710
only failure gives you that kind of 
alone isolation,

1580
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:38,400
downtime when you can really reinvent 
yourself in a significant way and create

1581
01:23:38,621 --> 01:23:43,621
something remarkable again,
that ongoing success becomes kind of a,

1582
01:23:45,140 --> 01:23:46,930
uh,
mediocrity.

1583
01:23:47,650 --> 01:23:48,483
You really need to fail to fall out of 
the limelight long enough to produce 

1584
01:23:51,581 --> 01:23:52,930
something really strong again.

1585
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:55,363
Totally makes sense.
One of the best things that can happen 

1586
01:23:57,501 --> 01:24:02,501
to a comedian is bombing when you bomb.
That feeling is so bad.

1587
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:06,320
I was describing as like sucking a 
thousand Dick's in front of your mother.

1588
01:24:07,670 --> 01:24:08,503
But the problem is the differences that 
there's probably someone out there who 

1589
01:24:10,521 --> 01:24:12,680
would enjoy suck a thousand Dick's in 
front of their mother,

1590
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:15,800
but nobody enjoys bombing.
So it's probably worse than that.

1591
01:24:16,070 --> 01:24:16,903
But that feeling,
whatever it is reignites your 

1592
01:24:20,661 --> 01:24:25,661
appreciation for people's attention span
your appreciation for tightening up your

1593
01:24:26,811 --> 01:24:29,240
delivery,
your concepts,

1594
01:24:29,390 --> 01:24:31,220
figuring out a better way to get them 
through.

1595
01:24:31,221 --> 01:24:32,054
You never want to experience that again.
And some of the greatest moments in my 

1596
01:24:35,901 --> 01:24:39,530
own personal journey of standup have 
come from eating shit.

1597
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:42,470
That's where they come from.
You've got each,

1598
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:45,110
I mean it's great to do well,
wonderful feels great.

1599
01:24:45,260 --> 01:24:46,093
But those eating shit ones,
those are the ones that get you to the 

1600
01:24:48,591 --> 01:24:49,010
notebook.

1601
01:24:49,010 --> 01:24:49,843
Again,
those are the ones that reinvigorate 

1602
01:24:51,351 --> 01:24:52,184
you.
Have you spending hours and hours in 

1603
01:24:53,121 --> 01:24:57,520
your hotel room going over sheets of 
paper and checking out idea,

1604
01:24:57,540 --> 01:24:58,373
making sure these concepts connect 
together in some sort of a meaningful 

1605
01:25:00,531 --> 01:25:02,120
way and figuring out what tightened 
things.

1606
01:25:02,330 --> 01:25:03,163
Cut out the fat.
When you're in this situation right now 

1607
01:25:06,050 --> 01:25:08,280
and you're frantically writing now and,
and,

1608
01:25:08,281 --> 01:25:11,810
and you know,
and sort of forced into this,

1609
01:25:11,811 --> 01:25:13,370
uh,
element of creativity,

1610
01:25:13,371 --> 01:25:14,510
this like,
you're,

1611
01:25:14,511 --> 01:25:17,990
you're forced to be hungry again.
I mean,

1612
01:25:18,050 --> 01:25:20,120
I wouldn't wish it on you,
but in a way,

1613
01:25:20,121 --> 01:25:21,530
do you feel like it's kind of a gift?

1614
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:23,300
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

1615
01:25:23,301 --> 01:25:24,134
You in a way,
you have to accept ultimately that 

1616
01:25:25,881 --> 01:25:26,714
everything is a gift because it's always
about what they call cognitive 

1617
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:34,250
reframing,
cognitive reframing,

1618
01:25:34,490 --> 01:25:35,323
whatever happens,
you reframe it in such a way that you 

1619
01:25:38,061 --> 01:25:40,370
recognize the value of it.
Um,

1620
01:25:40,610 --> 01:25:43,460
and so yeah,
regardless of what happens,

1621
01:25:44,210 --> 01:25:46,010
you know,
before my father got murdered,

1622
01:25:46,490 --> 01:25:49,460
he had been asking me for an 
introduction to what Nolan,

1623
01:25:49,461 --> 01:25:54,461
a writer in 1998 and I kept on thinking,
I am not going to introduce my father to

1624
01:25:55,671 --> 01:25:58,910
one a writer because I know he's going 
to hit on her.

1625
01:26:00,850 --> 01:26:01,683
And I wouldn't just going to be 
mortified to have dad hitting on Winona 

1626
01:26:04,311 --> 01:26:05,144
on a rider.
And he'd always talk about how pretty 

1627
01:26:06,501 --> 01:26:09,680
she was.
Any chance I can meet her and,

1628
01:26:09,950 --> 01:26:12,140
and,
and to tell the truth,

1629
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:13,033
when I got the word that my father had 
been murdered by white supremacists to 

1630
01:26:15,690 --> 01:26:17,210
the mountains of Idaho.

1631
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:18,660
Okay.

1632
01:26:18,660 --> 01:26:23,250
One of my first thoughts was I'm off the
hook without Wynona rider thing.

1633
01:26:27,010 --> 01:26:27,260
Okay.

1634
01:26:27,260 --> 01:26:32,260
And that's cognitive reframing.
And you had to do it all the time.

1635
01:26:33,310 --> 01:26:38,310
That's glass half full right there.
How long my father,

1636
01:26:40,420 --> 01:26:42,790
but you know,
nobody,

1637
01:26:43,090 --> 01:26:45,310
none,
none of our relationships are completely

1638
01:26:45,311 --> 01:26:46,700
perfect all the time.
Right.

1639
01:26:47,550 --> 01:26:48,910
It's no way around it.
Yeah.

1640
01:26:48,970 --> 01:26:50,650
Yeah.
Well that's again,

1641
01:26:51,250 --> 01:26:52,083
the great thing about unchained writing 
is that you can express those ideas and 

1642
01:26:58,091 --> 01:26:58,924
that would,
that would be my main concern about any 

1643
01:27:01,391 --> 01:27:02,224
sort of,
uh,

1644
01:27:02,670 --> 01:27:04,860
a workshop or support group or any,
any,

1645
01:27:04,861 --> 01:27:05,694
any,
any sort of group of like minded peers 

1646
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:11,920
that wouldn't understand that and that 
would want you to limit your language.

1647
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:17,260
I just don't,
it just doesn't compute.

1648
01:27:17,860 --> 01:27:20,410
Yeah.
And in the platonic world,

1649
01:27:20,411 --> 01:27:22,510
yeah,
everybody should kind of get it.

1650
01:27:23,260 --> 01:27:26,020
But unless you're ruffling feathers,
even within workshop,

1651
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:28,900
you're not going far enough.
You know,

1652
01:27:29,170 --> 01:27:32,290
I loved riding that line in Fight Club,
uh,

1653
01:27:32,291 --> 01:27:34,870
where tyler and Marla have sex for the 
first time.

1654
01:27:35,110 --> 01:27:38,260
And then the most romantic thing that,
that Marla can say is,

1655
01:27:38,261 --> 01:27:41,260
I want to have your baby.
So what is the inverse?

1656
01:27:41,530 --> 01:27:44,260
So of course Marla turns to him and she 
says,

1657
01:27:44,261 --> 01:27:47,110
I hope I got pregnant because I really 
want to have your abortion.

1658
01:27:48,310 --> 01:27:53,110
And that's the line that the movie 
studio went around and around.

1659
01:27:53,111 --> 01:27:54,550
And even Brad Pitt said,
you know,

1660
01:27:54,551 --> 01:27:59,380
my mom's going to see this movie.
I don't want her to see this line.

1661
01:28:00,490 --> 01:28:04,240
And they shot that scene with so many 
different substitute lines.

1662
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:08,290
And then finally fincher wrote the line 
and Helena Bonham Carter says,

1663
01:28:08,291 --> 01:28:10,690
I haven't been fuck like that since 
grade school.

1664
01:28:11,830 --> 01:28:13,630
And at that point,
20th Century Fox said,

1665
01:28:13,631 --> 01:28:14,464
can we switch it back to the abortion?
And so unless you're always kind of 

1666
01:28:22,981 --> 01:28:27,030
pushing to kind of,
you know,

1667
01:28:27,690 --> 01:28:28,523
until you get some push back,
you don't feel like you're pushing hard 

1668
01:28:30,571 --> 01:28:34,290
enough.
And so push back is not a bad thing.

1669
01:28:34,291 --> 01:28:36,870
It's just kind of a,
it's proof that you're doing your job.

1670
01:28:37,650 --> 01:28:39,080
Does it trend that's happening.
Putting

1671
01:28:39,140 --> 01:28:41,370
down though this,
this,

1672
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:44,230
that,
this pushback is coming far quicker than

1673
01:28:44,231 --> 01:28:47,020
it ever has before,
is that there's a trend now to,

1674
01:28:47,070 --> 01:28:52,070
to limit language and limit creativity 
and just limit the subject matter,

1675
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:56,920
trigger warnings and stop people from,
you know,

1676
01:28:57,340 --> 01:29:00,250
it stopped people from experiencing 
things that might be disturbing.

1677
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:03,173
And I could see both sides of that 
because on one hand we've got a 

1678
01:29:06,031 --> 01:29:06,864
generation that has been exposed to so 
much sensationalistic stuff in order to 

1679
01:29:11,341 --> 01:29:12,174
attain their attention.
They've really been overloaded with the 

1680
01:29:15,121 --> 01:29:18,770
most extreme versions of everything in 
order to get there,

1681
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:19,673
their ticket money or whatever,
they've really been pounded by so much 

1682
01:29:23,341 --> 01:29:24,174
stimuli.
I could see them kind of really pulling 

1683
01:29:26,131 --> 01:29:28,770
back and wanting to be monastic for the 
rest of their lives.

1684
01:29:29,790 --> 01:29:33,110
And on the other hand,
I see them as being a,

1685
01:29:34,940 --> 01:29:35,773
as wanting to sort of counter dominate 
in order to just create room enough in 

1686
01:29:39,951 --> 01:29:43,160
the world for their statement.
You know,

1687
01:29:43,190 --> 01:29:44,023
they're,
they're moving into a world that's 

1688
01:29:44,901 --> 01:29:49,901
already so occupied by attention getters
that if they can shut some down,

1689
01:29:51,140 --> 01:29:53,000
there might be room for their own 
expression.

1690
01:29:53,750 --> 01:29:54,583
So I kinda see benefit on both sides and
in a way to there they're dominating 

1691
01:29:59,751 --> 01:30:03,170
their teachers,
which is good because it's this in a way

1692
01:30:03,171 --> 01:30:04,004
of exploring your own power and,
and figuring out what you can do in the 

1693
01:30:07,491 --> 01:30:11,900
world and that you can have a effect.
You can have agency.

1694
01:30:12,980 --> 01:30:14,840
So I don't think it's a totally bad 
thing.

1695
01:30:15,470 --> 01:30:16,710
That's interesting.
The,

1696
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:17,593
the,
the idea that damn dominating their 

1697
01:30:18,981 --> 01:30:22,130
teachers is in some way good.
Having the,

1698
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:23,293
well,
it certainly gives you confidence and 

1699
01:30:27,390 --> 01:30:31,520
lets you understand that you can affect 
change even if it's meaningless.

1700
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:32,353
Changed you.
Did you pay attention to what happened 

1701
01:30:33,861 --> 01:30:35,220
in Evergreen state?
In,

1702
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:37,340
in Washington?
Yeah.

1703
01:30:37,490 --> 01:30:40,520
Did you see when there's a,
for people don't know the story.

1704
01:30:40,820 --> 01:30:41,653
It's a,
the Bret Weinstein story where the 

1705
01:30:44,270 --> 01:30:47,300
students decided that there was going to
be a day of absence.

1706
01:30:47,660 --> 01:30:51,230
Traditionally it had been where people 
of color stayed home just so that people

1707
01:30:51,231 --> 01:30:55,310
could recognize the important part that 
they play in the culture and society.

1708
01:30:55,580 --> 01:30:56,413
But then they had ramped it up and 
decided white people are going to have 

1709
01:30:58,611 --> 01:31:00,470
to stay home now.
And he was like,

1710
01:31:00,471 --> 01:31:01,304
that's racist.
And the whole thing went crazy and went 

1711
01:31:03,321 --> 01:31:04,154
haywire.
And the,

1712
01:31:04,180 --> 01:31:07,490
the schools basically fallen apart.
Um,

1713
01:31:07,550 --> 01:31:08,383
but there was a scene that was filmed 
where the president of the university 

1714
01:31:13,850 --> 01:31:15,910
was in,
uh,

1715
01:31:16,100 --> 01:31:16,933
the president of college was in this 
auditorium and he was addressing these 

1716
01:31:19,761 --> 01:31:20,594
children and uh,
they told him to stop moving his hands 

1717
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:28,490
because it was threatening.
And so he put his hands down,

1718
01:31:28,491 --> 01:31:30,530
he put them behind his back and they all
started laughing.

1719
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:33,910
And I was like,
wow,

1720
01:31:33,911 --> 01:31:36,010
this dumb fuck like this,
this,

1721
01:31:36,070 --> 01:31:41,070
this guy's running this university.
And he let them tell him not to move his

1722
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:43,450
hands.
Gesturing is you speaking.

1723
01:31:43,451 --> 01:31:44,290
And he's like,
what are the ones,

1724
01:31:44,440 --> 01:31:47,830
one of the most nonthreatening Beta 
people on the planet?

1725
01:31:48,100 --> 01:31:48,933
And this guy is just giving,
just wants to keep his job and try to 

1726
01:31:51,641 --> 01:31:54,850
silence this mob,
this angry horde of,

1727
01:31:55,270 --> 01:31:56,920
you know,
fucking kids.

1728
01:31:56,950 --> 01:32:01,420
They're kids.
But when he and puts his hands down,

1729
01:32:01,540 --> 01:32:04,750
I probably watched it 10 times.
They all start laughing,

1730
01:32:05,220 --> 01:32:06,053
you know,
and just,

1731
01:32:06,090 --> 01:32:11,010
I think it just demonstrates how 
desperately they want a stronger leader.

1732
01:32:11,220 --> 01:32:12,390
Yeah.
They don't want,

1733
01:32:12,510 --> 01:32:13,343
they don't respect their,
didn't want to learn from somebody who 

1734
01:32:17,070 --> 01:32:20,760
is a college professor and has never 
really attained anything in the world.

1735
01:32:20,761 --> 01:32:23,670
They just don't want to become another 
cog in that same kind of,

1736
01:32:24,060 --> 01:32:25,260
you know,
we'll,

1737
01:32:25,770 --> 01:32:26,603
they want to learn from somebody the 
respect and whose attainments the they 

1738
01:32:31,711 --> 01:32:35,030
respect whose achievements they respect 
where that's probably right.

1739
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:36,730
Part of the issue of universities,
right?

1740
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:40,390
Is it these professors are so terrified 
of the reactions of the students,

1741
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:41,433
which is not the place you're supposed 
to be with a mentor student 

1742
01:32:46,901 --> 01:32:49,540
relationship.
It's not supposed to be that way.

1743
01:32:49,990 --> 01:32:52,900
It's not supposed to be.
The mentor desperately needs the student

1744
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:53,953
in.
Now you see that sometimes in private 

1745
01:32:54,821 --> 01:32:58,090
schools with rich kids,
they treat their teachers like shit.

1746
01:32:58,091 --> 01:33:00,730
And the teachers have to bite their 
tongue and cause they,

1747
01:33:00,750 --> 01:33:03,070
they have to.
And now this is not,

1748
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:04,833
it's not,
not,

1749
01:33:04,870 --> 01:33:09,850
it's not the normal dynamic that exists 
with the older wise person and the young

1750
01:33:09,851 --> 01:33:10,684
person who's trying to learn from this 
person that deeply respects not that 

1751
01:33:13,091 --> 01:33:13,924
dynamic at all.
It's this old person who's weak and 

1752
01:33:16,961 --> 01:33:17,794
wants to keep their job and is willing 
to tailor their own thoughts and ideas 

1753
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:27,400
to this irrational mob of social justice
warriors.

1754
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:29,050
And that's what we're seeing on campuses
now.

1755
01:33:29,620 --> 01:33:33,460
You know,
professors calling for censorship and,

1756
01:33:34,180 --> 01:33:35,170
and,
and uh,

1757
01:33:35,230 --> 01:33:38,710
to stop freedom of expression.

1758
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:40,380
You know,
when I was in college,

1759
01:33:40,381 --> 01:33:43,170
my favorite professor,
Roy Halverson,

1760
01:33:43,470 --> 01:33:46,320
he was the John Houseman of the 
journalism school.

1761
01:33:46,630 --> 01:33:50,550
He was this old gray eminence and 
nothing made him happy.

1762
01:33:50,551 --> 01:33:52,710
You could never please this,
this,

1763
01:33:52,711 --> 01:33:55,080
uh,
this John houseman paper chase guy.

1764
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:57,440
Nothing was good enough and,
uh,

1765
01:33:58,260 --> 01:33:59,093
nothing would make him smile.
And I worked my ass off to make him 

1766
01:34:03,001 --> 01:34:03,834
happy.
And I finally got an a in one of his 

1767
01:34:05,281 --> 01:34:06,114
courses,
but he is about the only professor I 

1768
01:34:09,031 --> 01:34:09,864
remember out of my entire four years.
It was this man that just didn't take 

1769
01:34:14,341 --> 01:34:15,330
shit from anybody.

1770
01:34:16,830 --> 01:34:17,663
Yeah.
This the dynamic of the kid being in 

1771
01:34:21,601 --> 01:34:23,880
control.
It's not good for the kid either.

1772
01:34:24,930 --> 01:34:26,850
It's not good for any.
When they get out of school,

1773
01:34:26,851 --> 01:34:27,684
they're going to be baffled and they're 
gonna look for that power in other 

1774
01:34:30,511 --> 01:34:31,344
places,
that power that they enjoyed in the 

1775
01:34:33,001 --> 01:34:35,520
universities.
And you're seeing that spill off.

1776
01:34:36,270 --> 01:34:38,370
You seen that spill out into,
you know,

1777
01:34:38,371 --> 01:34:39,204
social media and different forms of 
activism when people trying to re 

1778
01:34:43,501 --> 01:34:47,520
achieve that power that they had and 
sort of forcing people to their will.

1779
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:48,833
And in a way it's kind of a farm camp 
because a few of those people will 

1780
01:34:52,051 --> 01:34:52,884
achieve that power and they will be able
to kind of leverage that power to 

1781
01:34:55,951 --> 01:34:57,980
something more,
something

1782
01:34:57,980 --> 01:34:59,480
larger.
And those will be the,

1783
01:34:59,490 --> 01:35:00,323
the,
the next generation of leaders that 

1784
01:35:01,281 --> 01:35:02,114
emerge.
So this isn't a way a laboratory where 

1785
01:35:04,940 --> 01:35:05,773
we're leaders are taking form and the 
rest of them we'll just kind of filter 

1786
01:35:09,861 --> 01:35:12,050
down into whatever jobs,
whatever careers.

1787
01:35:12,290 --> 01:35:13,123
But there will always have their kind of
glory days when they say to remember 

1788
01:35:15,201 --> 01:35:17,810
that time we shut down the ROTC 
building.

1789
01:35:18,220 --> 01:35:20,320
Um,
and that will seem like a,

1790
01:35:20,530 --> 01:35:23,060
a big glorious past to them.
But that will be enough.

1791
01:35:25,130 --> 01:35:26,840
What's causing all this,
the exam,

1792
01:35:26,870 --> 01:35:28,550
if you thought about that,
like why,

1793
01:35:28,551 --> 01:35:31,460
why is this ramping up?
Cause it seems like it is.

1794
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:38,513
Hmm.

1795
01:35:39,580 --> 01:35:40,413
You know,
on one level it is a disillusionment 

1796
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:44,433
with the,
uh,

1797
01:35:44,440 --> 01:35:47,930
the goals of the baby boomers.
But so many people have seen their,

1798
01:35:47,940 --> 01:35:48,773
their parents achieve what they thought 
was going to make them happy with the 

1799
01:35:52,541 --> 01:35:53,374
houses and the trips and the,
the careers and the possessions and the 

1800
01:35:56,831 --> 01:36:00,460
wives and the second wives and,
and the step siblings.

1801
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:02,073
And they're seeing their parents get 
everything that they want and still not 

1802
01:36:04,991 --> 01:36:05,824
be happy.
And so you see a generation that's kind 

1803
01:36:08,621 --> 01:36:10,150
of floundering thinking,
you know,

1804
01:36:11,710 --> 01:36:14,080
they don't know what's going to make 
them happy.

1805
01:36:14,140 --> 01:36:15,790
I don't know what's going to make me 
happy.

1806
01:36:16,420 --> 01:36:19,620
And so people were really distrustful of
advertisements.

1807
01:36:19,621 --> 01:36:21,190
It tell them what's gonna make them 
happy.

1808
01:36:21,730 --> 01:36:23,740
And so,
you know,

1809
01:36:23,741 --> 01:36:27,280
I think it's just a big,
a struggle,

1810
01:36:27,340 --> 01:36:30,070
a big everyone in blind in the dark 
right now.

1811
01:36:31,570 --> 01:36:32,470
So just,

1812
01:36:35,450 --> 01:36:38,990
just a reaction to what they see that's 
ineffective.

1813
01:36:39,020 --> 01:36:39,853
What did they see this going wrong?
That they're choosing to embrace a 

1814
01:36:43,791 --> 01:36:45,620
different group of values.
Right?

1815
01:36:46,010 --> 01:36:47,100
Well and,
but they don't,

1816
01:36:47,120 --> 01:36:47,953
not even sure even that new group of 
values kind of dictated to them with a 

1817
01:36:51,831 --> 01:36:55,780
lot of preexisting language.
And so I don't,

1818
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:58,520
I think ultimately that's not going to 
be very fulfilling either.

1819
01:36:58,700 --> 01:36:59,533
It's gotta be something that emerges 
from a kind of lymphoid laboratory like 

1820
01:37:04,251 --> 01:37:05,084
burning man,
these kind of fringe things that are 

1821
01:37:07,971 --> 01:37:09,890
all,
uh,

1822
01:37:10,370 --> 01:37:11,203
as Victor Turner would say.
There are all kinds of experiments in 

1823
01:37:16,430 --> 01:37:18,110
how to be,
uh,

1824
01:37:18,140 --> 01:37:18,973
that's what fight club was.
Just this kind of experiment in how 

1825
01:37:21,860 --> 01:37:24,050
interaction could be structured in a 
different way.

1826
01:37:24,590 --> 01:37:25,423
And these things take place in these 
kind of a playful environments like 

1827
01:37:28,851 --> 01:37:31,540
burning man,
like cacophony society used to,

1828
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:33,060
to do,
uh,

1829
01:37:34,310 --> 01:37:37,490
and they're fun.
And the ones that are the most fun,

1830
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:40,460
we'll,
we'll be the ones that are perpetuated.

1831
01:37:40,820 --> 01:37:45,820
Burning man is fun and that is why 
burning man has existed for 30 years and

1832
01:37:47,030 --> 01:37:50,690
occupy was not fun.
And that's why we had one occupy.

1833
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:54,080
And I know people are going to be pissed
off about that,

1834
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:56,040
but no,
every year burning

1835
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:56,873
man is bigger and it's funner and more 
people go there and every year we don't 

1836
01:38:00,631 --> 01:38:01,464
have another occupy.
Well I don't know if that's a valid 

1837
01:38:04,891 --> 01:38:05,724
comparison cause occupy was infiltrated 
by cops and the FBI and they pretended 

1838
01:38:10,231 --> 01:38:11,064
to be protestors and sat amongst them 
and the whole thing was kind of 

1839
01:38:14,060 --> 01:38:14,893
misguided in the first place.
Whereas what burning man is is a 

1840
01:38:17,461 --> 01:38:20,070
complete removal of these people from 
society.

1841
01:38:20,071 --> 01:38:23,040
I mean they decided to meet and one of 
the most hostile climates in the world.

1842
01:38:23,550 --> 01:38:26,400
And there's something about that,
the recognition that you're out there in

1843
01:38:26,401 --> 01:38:27,234
the desert with a fucking mask over your
face and you're dancing with dirty 

1844
01:38:29,731 --> 01:38:30,564
underwear on and then all these people 
are doing it together and then half of 

1845
01:38:33,421 --> 01:38:38,040
them are fucked out of their mind on 
drugs and you're not against something,

1846
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:40,590
you're not protesting something.
You're there to create,

1847
01:38:40,591 --> 01:38:42,000
celebrate,
celebrate,

1848
01:38:42,030 --> 01:38:43,050
contribute something.

1849
01:38:43,710 --> 01:38:45,180
Uh,
yeah.

1850
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:46,313
In the protests also at occupy,
a lot of them were misinformed and they 

1851
01:38:50,101 --> 01:38:52,830
didn't really understand the process 
they're protesting against.

1852
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:54,990
There's a very funny,
um,

1853
01:38:55,080 --> 01:38:55,913
famous video with Peter Schiff,
who's been on this podcast before as a 

1854
01:38:59,611 --> 01:39:01,440
financial wizard who,
uh,

1855
01:39:02,370 --> 01:39:05,820
was set up shop there with a $5,000 suit
on.

1856
01:39:06,120 --> 01:39:08,430
And he basically said,
I am the 1%,

1857
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:09,840
you know,
ask me questions.

1858
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:11,033
And he interviewed these kids who they 
would tell him what's wrong with the 

1859
01:39:13,951 --> 01:39:15,280
world and the,
the,

1860
01:39:15,870 --> 01:39:16,703
you know,
the imbalance of finances and financial 

1861
01:39:21,571 --> 01:39:22,404
inequity.
And they just didn't understand what 

1862
01:39:24,421 --> 01:39:25,254
they were upset about.
And he would explain to them how 

1863
01:39:27,241 --> 01:39:30,150
capitalism actually works and how he's 
employing all these people.

1864
01:39:30,270 --> 01:39:31,630
And the reason why he makes so much 
money,

1865
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:34,410
cause he employs so many people.
And if he wasn't doing this,

1866
01:39:34,411 --> 01:39:35,460
these people would be out of work.

1867
01:39:35,460 --> 01:39:36,293
You understand that I'm creating 
something and you can create something 

1868
01:39:38,221 --> 01:39:40,410
to,
you can create a business and you can,

1869
01:39:40,411 --> 01:39:41,244
if you work hard and you know,
and he's going over these and you could 

1870
01:39:43,831 --> 01:39:48,600
see that what they're fighting against 
is almost like a concept.

1871
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:49,793
They're fighting against this I idea of 
of this evil tyranny that's controlling 

1872
01:39:54,931 --> 01:39:58,410
their fate where they really don't 
understand it though.

1873
01:39:59,330 --> 01:40:02,330
That's,
that's what occupy was in my opinion.

1874
01:40:02,331 --> 01:40:04,800
It was like they knew something was 
wrong.

1875
01:40:04,980 --> 01:40:08,610
It was almost to me like white blood 
cells surrounding an infection,

1876
01:40:08,940 --> 01:40:09,773
like there's something fucked up here.
Let's just surround this thing and 

1877
01:40:12,541 --> 01:40:15,510
figure it out,
and then the swelling and pus and that's

1878
01:40:15,511 --> 01:40:16,344
really what it was.
It's like there's a real recognition 

1879
01:40:18,541 --> 01:40:21,660
that is a gigantic problem with the 
financial institutions.

1880
01:40:21,990 --> 01:40:22,823
The gigantic problem with the,
the whole reason why the economy 

1881
01:40:25,741 --> 01:40:26,574
collapsed and the bailouts and these 
fucking creeps are getting all these 

1882
01:40:30,181 --> 01:40:31,770
bonuses,
even though the the,

1883
01:40:31,771 --> 01:40:35,880
their companies failed and the tax 
dollars had a rescue them.

1884
01:40:36,450 --> 01:40:37,283
There was a recognition that there was 
something wrong but not a deep 

1885
01:40:39,991 --> 01:40:44,040
understanding of what the system was 
that they were actually protesting.

1886
01:40:44,340 --> 01:40:45,173
There was too much of that burning man 
doesn't have any of that burning man is 

1887
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:54,250
obviously society's fucked.
There's no arguments that it's not even

1888
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:56,230
if it's better than it's ever been 
before,

1889
01:40:56,260 --> 01:40:57,730
which it probably is,
you know,

1890
01:40:57,731 --> 01:40:58,564
if you want to listen to pinker or a lot
of other people that will argue that 

1891
01:41:01,481 --> 01:41:02,314
it's better and it's progressing into 
this better and better path and I think 

1892
01:41:05,341 --> 01:41:09,700
that's probably right.
Ultimately it's still fucked and burning

1893
01:41:09,701 --> 01:41:10,534
man offers this alternative,
like this unique society of free 

1894
01:41:15,611 --> 01:41:19,870
expression and free love and all these 
people having a good time together,

1895
01:41:19,871 --> 01:41:21,820
exploring alternate states of 
consciousness.

1896
01:41:22,330 --> 01:41:25,930
Well Victor Turner who talked about 
these lumoid events,

1897
01:41:26,260 --> 01:41:27,093
it would say things like burning man.
They also provide an outlet for people 

1898
01:41:29,861 --> 01:41:34,730
to self select to leave the culture.
They are,

1899
01:41:34,740 --> 01:41:36,040
they're killed.
You know,

1900
01:41:36,070 --> 01:41:36,903
people who just don't fit in,
they die or they express themselves so 

1901
01:41:40,871 --> 01:41:41,704
much that they can go back to the 
ordinary postal carrier life that they 

1902
01:41:45,521 --> 01:41:46,354
had before.
Because so many cultures have something 

1903
01:41:47,981 --> 01:41:52,981
like a Samba,
a festival where you go crazy for a week

1904
01:41:53,980 --> 01:41:57,370
and then you go back to your normal life
waiting tables.

1905
01:41:57,730 --> 01:42:01,990
So they are in a way an event that kind 
of keeps the status quo in place.

1906
01:42:03,070 --> 01:42:08,070
But they do create these kind of,
if not aesthetic movements,

1907
01:42:08,440 --> 01:42:09,273
they are the dairy,
our laboratory for sort of coming up 

1908
01:42:12,221 --> 01:42:15,190
with some new form of being together,
some new social structure,

1909
01:42:15,220 --> 01:42:18,550
new symbols and uh,
you know,

1910
01:42:18,700 --> 01:42:21,340
new narrative.
Yeah,

1911
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:22,233
it's,
it's a fascinating thing for me because 

1912
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:25,233
I feel it's trickled off into regular 
life and a lot of ways now I know way 

1913
01:42:28,691 --> 01:42:33,070
more people that are microdosing a 
silicide been on a daily basis.

1914
01:42:33,370 --> 01:42:34,203
People were more access,
especially now that marijuana's legal 

1915
01:42:37,750 --> 01:42:38,583
people are way more accepting of people 
getting high of people just choosing to 

1916
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:45,633
sort of look at the world in a different
way and actively seek these different 

1917
01:42:52,061 --> 01:42:54,340
states of consciousness.
It's way more common.

1918
01:42:54,341 --> 01:42:55,174
It's way more discussed and that's kind 
of the way it's supposed to be is that 

1919
01:42:58,151 --> 01:42:58,984
these things start in the experiments 
and the ones that are most successful 

1920
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:04,510
become institutions.

1921
01:43:04,950 --> 01:43:07,780
Uh,
and in the new ones start,

1922
01:43:08,430 --> 01:43:09,263
oh,
but we need know these are the 

1923
01:43:10,601 --> 01:43:12,940
laboratories.
Portland kind of used to be that way.

1924
01:43:12,941 --> 01:43:15,970
Portland was such a laboratory,
incubator city,

1925
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:18,130
but uh,
the cost of living is,

1926
01:43:18,430 --> 01:43:21,160
is killing that very quickly.
It's become really trendy.

1927
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:22,593
It's like,
it's a,

1928
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:25,570
it's a,
it's a hip place to live.

1929
01:43:26,140 --> 01:43:30,230
It's a hip and it's identified with hip,
you know,

1930
01:43:30,250 --> 01:43:32,920
in a way you kind of get your hip card 
just by living there.

1931
01:43:32,921 --> 01:43:36,670
You don't have to do anything anymore.
It's like New York City's to be like,

1932
01:43:36,671 --> 01:43:37,660
you were tough.
Hey,

1933
01:43:37,661 --> 01:43:39,310
I'm from New York,
you know,

1934
01:43:39,311 --> 01:43:40,630
I can handle it.
Yeah.

1935
01:43:40,930 --> 01:43:42,220
Yeah.
I'm hip.

1936
01:43:42,430 --> 01:43:43,330
I'm from Portland.

1937
01:43:46,990 --> 01:43:50,770
Nope.
Is that where you live?

1938
01:43:51,320 --> 01:43:52,910
I live outside of Portland.
I uh,

1939
01:43:53,170 --> 01:43:55,700
I live up in the Columbia Gorge.
It's gorgeous up there,

1940
01:43:55,701 --> 01:43:56,480
man.
Yeah,

1941
01:43:56,480 --> 01:44:00,020
the fucking green.
Do you guys have a neon glowing?

1942
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:02,990
It rains all the time.
Green in Oregon.

1943
01:44:02,991 --> 01:44:05,330
That's just,
we don't experience here for more than a

1944
01:44:05,330 --> 01:44:05,840
month.
A year.

1945
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:07,490
Yeah.
We got forest fires right now.

1946
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:08,360
So,
Oh,

1947
01:44:08,361 --> 01:44:10,040
do you where you are?
Uh,

1948
01:44:10,100 --> 01:44:12,350
not so much this year.
They're not so close,

1949
01:44:12,351 --> 01:44:15,110
but the air is still much worse than it 
is here.

1950
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:17,930
So fucking forest fires are everywhere 
right now.

1951
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:21,110
I've been evacuated a couple of times.
It's pretty terrifying stuff.

1952
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:23,150
Do you like at Georgia?
No,

1953
01:44:23,151 --> 01:44:23,841
I live here.
Oh,

1954
01:44:23,841 --> 01:44:24,674
okay.
Okay.

1955
01:44:24,740 --> 01:44:25,970
Georgia.
Why just say Georgia?

1956
01:44:25,990 --> 01:44:27,830
Somebody told you whisper like no one's 
listening.

1957
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:33,350
Don't tell her.
Why.

1958
01:44:33,351 --> 01:44:36,770
Have a secret friendship with Jim Goad.
Who's one of the few people who makes me

1959
01:44:36,771 --> 01:44:40,010
really laugh even though you know most 
of the secret anymore.

1960
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:43,190
Most of the world that hates Jim Code.
Why do they hate gym goad?

1961
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:44,233
Um,
because he writes these very 

1962
01:44:45,381 --> 01:44:50,381
transgressive in your face pieces.
But when he writes about his brother,

1963
01:44:50,750 --> 01:44:53,980
he kills me is some of the most,
uh,

1964
01:44:54,020 --> 01:44:57,590
touching stuff I've ever read in my life
about his brother's death.

1965
01:44:58,100 --> 01:44:59,480
Um,
so,

1966
01:44:59,740 --> 01:45:02,810
you know,
the whole world I think is so fooled and

1967
01:45:02,811 --> 01:45:04,850
that they think that Jim gold is a bad 
person.

1968
01:45:05,060 --> 01:45:05,893
And they think that maybe I'm a good 
person when it's just exactly the 

1969
01:45:08,901 --> 01:45:13,550
opposite of how are you a bad person?
Oh,

1970
01:45:13,551 --> 01:45:17,690
let's not even go down that road.
I already told on Cheryl strayed killing

1971
01:45:17,691 --> 01:45:18,710
that bird.
Come on.

1972
01:45:18,711 --> 01:45:21,170
Do I got to do more?
That's not being a bad person.

1973
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:23,570
That's a person who is appreciative of a
dark moment.

1974
01:45:24,350 --> 01:45:28,970
That doesn't make you a bad person.
No,

1975
01:45:28,971 --> 01:45:31,310
I'm a bad person.
Are you really?

1976
01:45:33,060 --> 01:45:35,420
Give me an example.
You know,

1977
01:45:35,830 --> 01:45:36,663
and this is awkward,
but this is another one of those 

1978
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:39,740
cognitive

1979
01:45:41,410 --> 01:45:42,243
reframing honesty things,
is I took care of my mother while she 

1980
01:45:46,121 --> 01:45:46,954
was dying of lung cancer,
and even while I was taking care of her 

1981
01:45:51,160 --> 01:45:54,070
and she was lapsing in and out of 
consciousness in her home,

1982
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:55,833
there was a little part of me that felt 
is glee that thought I will never have 

1983
01:46:01,251 --> 01:46:05,330
to worry about mom again.
I will never have to worry about whether

1984
01:46:05,331 --> 01:46:06,164
mom is offended by my work.
I will never have to worry about mom 

1985
01:46:09,681 --> 01:46:11,870
falling down the stairs and breaking her
leg.

1986
01:46:12,590 --> 01:46:16,250
That this enormous concern in my life 
will be resolved.

1987
01:46:17,100 --> 01:46:17,933
Uh,

1988
01:46:18,540 --> 01:46:21,220
and it's going to be at the cost of 
losing someone I love,

1989
01:46:21,780 --> 01:46:23,260
you know,
so much.

1990
01:46:24,580 --> 01:46:29,580
But the benefit is that this huge burden
of responsibility is going to be lifted.

1991
01:46:31,390 --> 01:46:33,970
And so there was this kind of secret 
glee thinking,

1992
01:46:34,390 --> 01:46:35,051
you know,
I'm going to,

1993
01:46:35,051 --> 01:46:38,140
I'm going to have some freedom here that
I never imagined.

1994
01:46:39,290 --> 01:46:40,123
MMM.

1995
01:46:40,690 --> 01:46:41,523
Yeah.
Nora Ephron touches on that in her work 

1996
01:46:43,811 --> 01:46:47,200
when she talks about her mother's death.
And I think it's just a,

1997
01:46:47,260 --> 01:46:49,590
it's an,
it's an honest thing,

1998
01:46:50,190 --> 01:46:52,500
but it's not a thing that makes you look
very good.

1999
01:46:53,610 --> 01:46:55,890
I don't think that makes you a bad 
person.

2000
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:56,753
I think that that makes you a person 
who's honest about thoughts that are 

2001
01:47:00,421 --> 01:47:01,530
very uncomfortable.

2002
01:47:02,780 --> 01:47:03,400
Yeah.

2003
01:47:03,400 --> 01:47:04,233
That,
that is just something that people 

2004
01:47:05,471 --> 01:47:07,690
think,
I think all the time.

2005
01:47:07,720 --> 01:47:08,553
If they're dealing with someone who's 
completely incapacitated and they have 

2006
01:47:10,871 --> 01:47:12,340
to care for them 24,
seven,

2007
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:16,690
but they don't express it,
it's just,

2008
01:47:19,020 --> 01:47:19,853
it's just a reality of the burden of 
someone who's really sick or really 

2009
01:47:25,650 --> 01:47:26,990
dying.
Is it?

2010
01:47:27,060 --> 01:47:29,070
There's,
there's no getting around it.

2011
01:47:29,700 --> 01:47:31,740
I don't think it's about,
that's not a good example.

2012
01:47:32,060 --> 01:47:32,893
I need to,
I need an example of why you are a bad 

2013
01:47:34,201 --> 01:47:35,034
person.
Maybe you just really self critical and 

2014
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:41,590
aware of things that other people could 
take out of context of the,

2015
01:47:41,591 --> 01:47:43,320
the,
the totality of your life.

2016
01:47:43,710 --> 01:47:44,543
And just use it as an example.
Put it in quotes and using it as an 

2017
01:47:47,401 --> 01:47:49,770
example of you being a bad person.

2018
01:47:50,130 --> 01:47:52,920
You know,
another thing is I really,

2019
01:47:52,921 --> 01:47:57,170
really conflicted about the nature of my
creativity.

2020
01:47:57,460 --> 01:47:58,293
Yeah.
This idea that in journalism school 

2021
01:48:00,271 --> 01:48:01,104
they,
they call the theory seduce and betray 

2022
01:48:02,730 --> 01:48:04,680
that when you go into an interview 
situation,

2023
01:48:05,700 --> 01:48:06,533
your goal is to gain the trust of that 
person and to get them to reveal 

2024
01:48:10,651 --> 01:48:11,484
something very intimate that you are 
going to betray by revealing to the 

2025
01:48:15,001 --> 01:48:16,710
public.
So,

2026
01:48:17,810 --> 01:48:18,060
okay,

2027
01:48:18,060 --> 01:48:22,860
you're just basically going in there to,
to charm them and then to hurt them.

2028
01:48:23,880 --> 01:48:24,713
And uh,
and so much of my creative process is 

2029
01:48:27,781 --> 01:48:29,700
that way because,
uh,

2030
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:34,000
for example,
the guts story [inaudible] the,

2031
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:37,470
the story in which the guy puts the 
carrot up his blood,

2032
01:48:38,190 --> 01:48:39,023
that was my best friend at the time in 
like late twenties and he got 

2033
01:48:44,341 --> 01:48:45,174
fantastically drunk.
And he told me that carrot story and I 

2034
01:48:48,391 --> 01:48:52,950
honestly believe he had never told 
anybody the carrot story.

2035
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:54,593
And I,
I kept that story in my mind for you 

2036
01:48:56,441 --> 01:48:57,274
know,
10 15 almost probably 20 years until I 

2037
01:49:00,181 --> 01:49:01,014
found a way to put it with three similar
stories and make a larger piece out of 

2038
01:49:04,171 --> 01:49:07,890
it.
And the first time I read that story,

2039
01:49:08,310 --> 01:49:10,500
I hadn't seen him in maybe a couple of 
years.

2040
01:49:10,530 --> 01:49:11,363
This friend and I look across this big 
auditorium and there he is and I'm 

2041
01:49:16,591 --> 01:49:17,424
telling his carrot story in front of 
hundreds and hundreds of people and the 

2042
01:49:21,871 --> 01:49:23,820
look on his face,
he's just stricken

2043
01:49:26,590 --> 01:49:31,590
and he hasn't talked to me sad.
And this is why even even David,

2044
01:49:34,461 --> 01:49:35,990
did you use his name?
No.

2045
01:49:36,010 --> 01:49:37,910
Then fuck him.
No.

2046
01:49:37,970 --> 01:49:38,803
But what's wrong with that?
Do people still feel betrayed and get 

2047
01:49:41,961 --> 01:49:42,794
over it?
You need to hang out with more 

2048
01:49:43,971 --> 01:49:45,380
comedians.
Infuse a comic.

2049
01:49:45,381 --> 01:49:46,430
You'd be laughing.
Well,

2050
01:49:46,431 --> 01:49:47,980
you know,
David [inaudible]

2051
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:48,843
has told me,
he said his family is very reluctant to 

2052
01:49:51,371 --> 01:49:52,204
share their lives with them anymore 
because he's kind of made them 

2053
01:49:54,970 --> 01:49:55,803
involuntary public figures and they have
to deal with the fallout from these 

2054
01:49:59,341 --> 01:50:00,174
stories about them.
And really only his brother and his 

2055
01:50:02,201 --> 01:50:06,100
sister amy have kind of been able to 
spin this in a good way,

2056
01:50:06,760 --> 01:50:09,340
but it alienates a lot of people.
Oh,

2057
01:50:09,341 --> 01:50:10,210
for sure.
Well,

2058
01:50:10,211 --> 01:50:11,590
especially if you use their actual,
yeah.

2059
01:50:11,620 --> 01:50:15,100
Name or people know the origin of the 
actual story.

2060
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:16,120
Yeah,
yeah.

2061
01:50:17,050 --> 01:50:18,490
But that's,
you're not a bad person,

2062
01:50:18,550 --> 01:50:19,383
sorry.
Sorry to break it to you think you're a 

2063
01:50:21,521 --> 01:50:23,440
bad person.
Those are only examples.

2064
01:50:25,580 --> 01:50:26,413
Yeah.

2065
01:50:27,170 --> 01:50:28,850
You're not convinced.
No,

2066
01:50:28,851 --> 01:50:29,684
no.
I'm just not revealing the worst stuff 

2067
01:50:30,490 --> 01:50:31,323
that of course,

2068
01:50:34,050 --> 01:50:34,883
think that you have to have some sort of
embracing of these dark thoughts to 

2069
01:50:41,131 --> 01:50:43,170
create the way you create.
I mean,

2070
01:50:43,171 --> 01:50:48,171
you're creating these characters that go
down some horrible roads,

2071
01:50:49,440 --> 01:50:51,810
both mentally and in reality,
in,

2072
01:50:51,811 --> 01:50:56,160
in your work and it's amazing stuff.
But to cultivate that,

2073
01:50:56,161 --> 01:50:56,994
don't you think?
You have to be kind of in touch with 

2074
01:50:58,111 --> 01:51:00,960
those thoughts of your own to kind of in
touch with this?

2075
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:04,333
You know,
this thing where you're watching your 

2076
01:51:05,061 --> 01:51:08,300
mom dying you,
you are going to be relieved of a burden

2077
01:51:08,930 --> 01:51:12,830
and you don't want to tell anybody that 
you're kind of looking forward to that a

2078
01:51:12,831 --> 01:51:14,870
little bit.
Even though you love your mom dearly,

2079
01:51:15,590 --> 01:51:15,930
this,
that,

2080
01:51:15,930 --> 01:51:20,930
that's a natural thing that people don't
want to discuss but absolutely exists.

2081
01:51:23,060 --> 01:51:24,560
It's the elephant in the room.

2082
01:51:25,210 --> 01:51:26,520
And,
and that's kind of like,

2083
01:51:26,521 --> 01:51:27,354
yeah,
how comedy works or anything where 

2084
01:51:29,451 --> 01:51:33,260
you're stating this unstated thing.
You're creating this enormous relief.

2085
01:51:33,800 --> 01:51:36,220
Uh,
uh,

2086
01:51:36,260 --> 01:51:40,100
my classic example when I teach,
I asked my students,

2087
01:51:40,101 --> 01:51:40,820
I say,
so,

2088
01:51:40,820 --> 01:51:43,610
so what do you call a black man that 
flies a plane?

2089
01:51:46,240 --> 01:51:47,073
Okay,

2090
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:49,170
a pilot.
You fucking racist.

2091
01:51:51,750 --> 01:51:53,940
You're creating this tension,
right?

2092
01:51:54,140 --> 01:51:54,973
Hey,
don't want you to say what they think 

2093
01:51:56,251 --> 01:51:58,800
you're going to say.
They don't want to hate you.

2094
01:51:59,190 --> 01:52:00,540
They like you,
right?

2095
01:52:00,570 --> 01:52:03,330
And they don't want you to say something
hateful and awful.

2096
01:52:03,420 --> 01:52:05,760
Yeah.
And then you turn it around,

2097
01:52:05,761 --> 01:52:07,920
he put it on them.
Um,

2098
01:52:08,370 --> 01:52:11,130
and so in a way,
you know,

2099
01:52:11,131 --> 01:52:13,950
I always think that's the,
the soul of comedy is to create this,

2100
01:52:14,010 --> 01:52:17,580
this tension that you relieve as quickly
as possible.

2101
01:52:18,090 --> 01:52:22,680
And the relief occurs as laughter.
I was having dinner

2102
01:52:22,820 --> 01:52:24,560
with a,
a good friend of mine,

2103
01:52:24,561 --> 01:52:25,394
his wife and a buddy of mine and my 
friend's friend and his wife and fun 

2104
01:52:32,301 --> 01:52:35,960
time the whole night.
Everybody's laughing and joking and,

2105
01:52:36,580 --> 01:52:37,413
or have a dinner and having a couple of 
drinks and joking around talking about 

2106
01:52:41,571 --> 01:52:45,920
things.
And I forget

2107
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:51,040
what led to him saying this,
but we were talking about,

2108
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:57,050
oh,
just unfortunate scenarios and you know,

2109
01:52:57,051 --> 01:52:57,884
people that just,
their life is not going the way they'd 

2110
01:53:01,011 --> 01:53:03,680
like it to go.
And things going back and out of nowhere

2111
01:53:03,681 --> 01:53:04,940
the guy goes,
well,

2112
01:53:06,540 --> 01:53:07,373
that's like this.

2113
01:53:10,010 --> 01:53:13,490
My daughter has a,
she had a baby with a black man

2114
01:53:15,620 --> 01:53:17,960
and we're,
we're both like looking at him like,

2115
01:53:17,961 --> 01:53:20,950
where's this going?
And then he goes and uh,

2116
01:53:20,990 --> 01:53:21,823
you know,
I just think it's incredibly selfish to 

2117
01:53:23,961 --> 01:53:27,530
bring that kid into the world.
And this kid doesn't have an identity.

2118
01:53:27,531 --> 01:53:31,550
They're not black and the not white and 
they don't,

2119
01:53:31,551 --> 01:53:32,960
they're,
they're not going to have an identity.

2120
01:53:32,961 --> 01:53:34,640
They're not going to have a group to 
belong to.

2121
01:53:34,970 --> 01:53:37,970
And my friends,
jaws dropped.

2122
01:53:38,060 --> 01:53:38,893
My,
I didn't know the guy had spent on that 

2123
01:53:39,920 --> 01:53:40,753
night and my drop and I looked at my 
other friend who was with me who didn't 

2124
01:53:44,151 --> 01:53:46,310
know any of these other people.
And everyone's like,

2125
01:53:46,311 --> 01:53:50,030
what the fuck?
And then a couple of us get up and go to

2126
01:53:50,031 --> 01:53:50,864
the bathroom.
And I turned to my friend Andrew and I 

2127
01:53:52,791 --> 01:53:54,020
said,
let's get the fuck out of here.

2128
01:53:54,260 --> 01:53:56,000
And we just laughed.
And I texted my friend,

2129
01:53:56,001 --> 01:53:57,620
I go,
too much racism had to go.

2130
01:53:57,950 --> 01:54:00,350
And we just left.
And uh,

2131
01:54:00,740 --> 01:54:04,640
but it was so weird.
It's like this guy was holding into this

2132
01:54:04,641 --> 01:54:05,271
and he's like,
you know what?

2133
01:54:05,271 --> 01:54:07,310
I can trust these people.
It's some racist shit.

2134
01:54:07,700 --> 01:54:09,470
I can trust them.
And it didn't work.

2135
01:54:09,650 --> 01:54:10,483
And he knew it didn't work.
He knew it went over the world like a 

2136
01:54:14,661 --> 01:54:16,280
lead balloon.
He knew it.

2137
01:54:16,310 --> 01:54:18,140
He could feel it because everybody was 
like,

2138
01:54:18,141 --> 01:54:19,760
what?
Like,

2139
01:54:19,761 --> 01:54:22,970
wait a minute,
your daughter's in love with a man who's

2140
01:54:22,971 --> 01:54:25,790
black,
they have a child together and you think

2141
01:54:25,791 --> 01:54:28,310
it's incredibly selfish to bring their 
kid in the world.

2142
01:54:28,820 --> 01:54:33,050
Like what the fuck?
I wish I could remember what the fuck we

2143
01:54:33,051 --> 01:54:33,884
were talking about before then.
But what we're talking about before 

2144
01:54:36,741 --> 01:54:37,574
then,
it was like drug addicts or people fuck 

2145
01:54:39,051 --> 01:54:39,884
up or you know,
people were directed to gambling or 

2146
01:54:41,511 --> 01:54:42,344
something and the people whose lives 
were in chaos and then he brings up his 

2147
01:54:46,040 --> 01:54:46,873
daughter having a baby with a,
a guy who was the wrong amount of 

2148
01:54:49,701 --> 01:54:53,420
melanin skin,
whose ancestors came from the wrong part

2149
01:54:53,421 --> 01:54:56,510
of the world for him.
It was weird,

2150
01:54:56,511 --> 01:54:57,350
man.
It was,

2151
01:54:57,351 --> 01:55:00,890
we,
it was weird also to see him recognize.

2152
01:55:02,170 --> 01:55:03,640
I did funny,
you know,

2153
01:55:03,710 --> 01:55:05,510
you throw out a story,
I throw out a story.

2154
01:55:06,190 --> 01:55:07,023
Uh,
I had a hired car from Philadelphia to 

2155
01:55:08,811 --> 01:55:11,390
New York once on tour.
And,

2156
01:55:11,391 --> 01:55:12,224
uh,
as we were going past liberty hall in 

2157
01:55:13,131 --> 01:55:15,170
Philadelphia,
this,

2158
01:55:15,350 --> 01:55:17,870
this great guy over the philly accent 
driving the car,

2159
01:55:18,460 --> 01:55:22,130
he points at Liberty Hall and he says,
that building has stood for,

2160
01:55:22,190 --> 01:55:23,420
you know,
300 years.

2161
01:55:23,600 --> 01:55:28,600
I bet you can't tell me why.
And I just looked.

2162
01:55:28,821 --> 01:55:29,654
And I said,
because the bricks are late in Flemish 

2163
01:55:31,401 --> 01:55:34,880
bond.
I think that's probably it with uh,

2164
01:55:34,920 --> 01:55:35,753
the,
the brick bricks are offset in such a 

2165
01:55:36,741 --> 01:55:39,680
way that they bond in the center.
It's called Flemish bond.

2166
01:55:40,900 --> 01:55:45,570
And the guys so silent,
nobody's ever answered the question.

2167
01:55:46,260 --> 01:55:48,900
And his father was a bricklayer and he 
was so proud.

2168
01:55:49,320 --> 01:55:50,310
And he goes,
you're right.

2169
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:55,400
Nobody's ever said Flemish bond.
That's why it's still stands.

2170
01:55:56,930 --> 01:55:57,763
And we were best friends and just 
talking like crazy all the way into 

2171
01:56:01,861 --> 01:56:03,810
Manhattan.
We get into Manhattan,

2172
01:56:04,680 --> 01:56:06,270
there's two guys walking down the 
street.

2173
01:56:06,810 --> 01:56:09,570
The Guy Goes,
oh Christ,

2174
01:56:09,660 --> 01:56:11,220
I hate coming to New York.
Ah,

2175
01:56:11,221 --> 01:56:12,060
the fags.

2176
01:56:13,780 --> 01:56:14,591
And I said,
well,

2177
01:56:14,591 --> 01:56:15,424
you know,
I'm married to a man and Faggot is 

2178
01:56:18,461 --> 01:56:19,294
pretty much my middle name now.
Poor guy had to do this whole re 

2179
01:56:28,510 --> 01:56:33,510
juggling of everything that the guy who 
knew Flemish bond was also one of them.

2180
01:56:35,800 --> 01:56:39,460
Oh.
And it was one of those wonderful,

2181
01:56:39,461 --> 01:56:44,461
kind of icky but necessary moments.
And I know they're horrible,

2182
01:56:46,991 --> 01:56:49,600
but you know,
things are better afterwards.

2183
01:56:50,310 --> 01:56:53,380
You must have loved that moment though.
You know,

2184
01:56:53,381 --> 01:56:54,214
it was a horrible moment because I felt 
like I was throwing away any kind of 

2185
01:56:57,220 --> 01:57:00,490
chatty conversational relationship I had
with this guy.

2186
01:57:00,970 --> 01:57:02,650
You seem like just the salt of the 
earth.

2187
01:57:02,651 --> 01:57:03,580
Great,
funny guy.

2188
01:57:04,420 --> 01:57:06,640
And it was just kind of going out on a 
limb and saying,

2189
01:57:06,641 --> 01:57:08,290
okay,
you know,

2190
01:57:08,291 --> 01:57:10,400
he's going to hate my guts after this.
Oh,

2191
01:57:12,730 --> 01:57:15,790
when I was a little kid,
we lived in San Francisco from age seven

2192
01:57:15,791 --> 01:57:18,100
to 11,
and then moved to Florida,

2193
01:57:18,190 --> 01:57:20,410
which is the polar opposite of San 
Francisco.

2194
01:57:20,950 --> 01:57:21,783
And,
uh,

2195
01:57:22,990 --> 01:57:23,823
uh,
I,

2196
01:57:24,200 --> 01:57:25,033
I really,
I don't know if I'd ever heard someone 

2197
01:57:27,341 --> 01:57:29,840
use the word faggot before,
but I'd never seen a,

2198
01:57:29,841 --> 01:57:32,260
an adult upset about gay people before 
him.

2199
01:57:32,590 --> 01:57:33,310
And then,
um,

2200
01:57:33,310 --> 01:57:37,580
my friend Candy Candido was his name.
Uh,

2201
01:57:37,750 --> 01:57:39,280
his dad was Cuban,
they were Cuban.

2202
01:57:39,670 --> 01:57:40,503
And,
uh,

2203
01:57:40,720 --> 01:57:43,660
his dad slams a newspaper on the,
on the table.

2204
01:57:43,661 --> 01:57:45,270
I was 11.
And he's like,

2205
01:57:45,310 --> 01:57:47,920
can't believe they're letting these fags
getting married.

2206
01:57:48,640 --> 01:57:52,990
He was just so angry and I remember 
stopping and thinking like,

2207
01:57:52,991 --> 01:57:54,890
here,
here's a man.

2208
01:57:54,940 --> 01:57:57,340
This guy is a man.
He's a grown man.

2209
01:57:57,341 --> 01:57:59,770
Like he's a grownup,
but yet he's,

2210
01:58:00,670 --> 01:58:05,670
he's got this infant idea of what a 
person should be like.

2211
01:58:05,981 --> 01:58:08,140
They got to fall into this category,
that category.

2212
01:58:08,140 --> 01:58:10,420
He's got it locked into his head.
He's a fucking baby,

2213
01:58:10,600 --> 01:58:13,980
but he's a man and he's my friend's Dad.
This guy sucks.

2214
01:58:13,981 --> 01:58:16,930
This guy made it to 35 years old or 
whatever the fuck he was.

2215
01:58:17,800 --> 01:58:18,633
And this is his,
this is his operating system that he's 

2216
01:58:20,951 --> 01:58:21,784
using to navigate its way through life.
I remember it being an important moment 

2217
01:58:26,351 --> 01:58:27,184
for me because I realize like just 
because someone is older doesn't mean 

2218
01:58:31,181 --> 01:58:33,160
they learned anything,
you know,

2219
01:58:33,180 --> 01:58:36,010
and that people are capable of success 
in life.

2220
01:58:36,280 --> 01:58:37,630
You know,
you could become married,

2221
01:58:37,631 --> 01:58:39,130
you can have children,
you get a house,

2222
01:58:39,131 --> 01:58:39,964
you get good job,
you drive a the hold that you got it 

2223
01:58:42,551 --> 01:58:44,120
all.
If you've got a checkbook,

2224
01:58:44,130 --> 01:58:45,220
you got fucking you,
you're,

2225
01:58:45,221 --> 01:58:46,480
you're,
you're operating,

2226
01:58:46,510 --> 01:58:48,430
it's moving,
you're successful,

2227
01:58:48,431 --> 01:58:51,280
it's happening.
And yet you still have these

2228
01:58:51,710 --> 01:58:54,800
stupid ideas.
But I think that the,

2229
01:58:54,801 --> 01:58:55,450
the,
uh,

2230
01:58:55,450 --> 01:58:58,280
there's a benefit to the expression of 
the stupid idea,

2231
01:58:58,580 --> 01:58:59,413
not that they can be challenged,
but that at least when we're aware that 

2232
01:59:03,561 --> 01:59:04,760
it's there.
Yeah.

2233
01:59:04,910 --> 01:59:05,870
And that,
you know,

2234
01:59:06,470 --> 01:59:07,303
we know that this thing is not just kind
of festering and that there's a way of 

2235
01:59:10,221 --> 01:59:11,054
kind of not fixing this person,
but at least we know where they're 

2236
01:59:14,151 --> 01:59:15,380
coming from.
Yeah.

2237
01:59:16,070 --> 01:59:17,540
I know it.
Ah,

2238
01:59:17,570 --> 01:59:21,110
another shooting myself in the career 
foot thing.

2239
01:59:21,320 --> 01:59:23,120
I don't think you've done it once the 
whole show.

2240
01:59:23,810 --> 01:59:24,890
Okay.
Here it goes.

2241
01:59:28,520 --> 01:59:33,520
I read the daily stormer.
Andrew Anglin cracks me up.

2242
01:59:37,520 --> 01:59:38,353
Who is that?
He is the completely transgressive guy 

2243
01:59:43,310 --> 01:59:45,680
who really loves fight club.
Oh,

2244
01:59:46,070 --> 01:59:46,903
writes for the daily stormer.
I think he is the daily stormer and he 

2245
01:59:50,271 --> 01:59:54,080
writes the most atrocious,
insensitive,

2246
01:59:54,440 --> 01:59:57,290
uh,
brutal things,

2247
01:59:58,190 --> 02:00:03,190
but they are there so shocking and so 
transgressive that,

2248
02:00:04,761 --> 02:00:05,594
uh,
that sometimes I laugh just out of the 

2249
02:00:08,001 --> 02:00:09,050
shock,
you know,

2250
02:00:09,340 --> 02:00:11,540
uh,
the old classic joke,

2251
02:00:11,541 --> 02:00:14,780
how do you get a nun pregnant?
You fuck her?

2252
02:00:15,680 --> 02:00:17,720
You know,
there's a shock value there that,

2253
02:00:18,200 --> 02:00:21,740
that just sort of jars me.
It makes me laugh.

2254
02:00:21,741 --> 02:00:22,360
Sometimes

2255
02:00:22,360 --> 02:00:26,020
that joke would work better if you 
hadn't told the black pilot choke first.

2256
02:00:26,290 --> 02:00:27,123
Well,
of course the problem is like people 

2257
02:00:28,331 --> 02:00:28,810
become,
uh,

2258
02:00:28,810 --> 02:00:30,520
you know,
you know what's coming.

2259
02:00:30,680 --> 02:00:32,480
Yeah.
But,

2260
02:00:32,481 --> 02:00:34,970
uh,
but sometimes,

2261
02:00:35,040 --> 02:00:35,420
uh,
you know,

2262
02:00:35,420 --> 02:00:36,253
I,
I want to go into a world where people 

2263
02:00:39,441 --> 02:00:42,920
are not watching their language so 
closely and,

2264
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:47,510
and I see people kind of a vent the 
worst of themselves,

2265
02:00:47,810 --> 02:00:50,600
right.
And I'm not kind of endorsing it,

2266
02:00:51,380 --> 02:00:56,380
but I feel a little less reactive to 
abuse.

2267
02:00:56,710 --> 02:00:57,543
A scientologist has had this exercise 
called bull baiting where they take you 

2268
02:01:01,371 --> 02:01:05,780
into a room and people surround you and 
they call you every horrible thing.

2269
02:01:05,781 --> 02:01:07,580
And then they,
they nit pick horror.

2270
02:01:07,640 --> 02:01:10,730
Every aspect of your appearance or your 
character,

2271
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:14,000
who you are,
and they attack you on every level.

2272
02:01:14,300 --> 02:01:16,850
And they do this for long,
long periods of time,

2273
02:01:16,851 --> 02:01:17,684
and they do this day after day until you
are completely not reactionary to that 

2274
02:01:21,591 --> 02:01:23,660
kind of verbal abuse.
You can,

2275
02:01:24,410 --> 02:01:25,243
you can put it over there,
you can accept the fact that it's 

2276
02:01:27,681 --> 02:01:30,230
somebody else's statements,
somebody else's opinion,

2277
02:01:30,290 --> 02:01:31,123
observation,
that it's not true and you can be with 

2278
02:01:34,101 --> 02:01:35,660
it.
And so in a way,

2279
02:01:35,990 --> 02:01:36,823
when I go into these sites that are so 
patently offensive and in a 

2280
02:01:42,351 --> 02:01:43,640
deliberately,
you know,

2281
02:01:43,641 --> 02:01:44,474
aggressively offensive,
I feel like in a way there are 

2282
02:01:47,391 --> 02:01:49,880
thickening my skin that,
uh,

2283
02:01:50,300 --> 02:01:55,130
I'm not quite a such a delicate little 
reactive thing afterwards.

2284
02:01:55,280 --> 02:01:56,113
Do you worry about someone looking 
through your search results or the far 

2285
02:01:59,241 --> 02:02:00,380
worse things than that?

2286
02:02:06,430 --> 02:02:08,410
Yeah.
You see that in fighting.

2287
02:02:08,820 --> 02:02:13,030
Um,
there's certain people that react really

2288
02:02:13,031 --> 02:02:13,864
poorly to trash talk and there's certain
people that get excited by it and it 

2289
02:02:17,771 --> 02:02:19,450
doesn't bother them at all and they 
embrace it.

2290
02:02:19,810 --> 02:02:20,643
And generally it's people who grew up in
abusive households and horrible 

2291
02:02:23,771 --> 02:02:26,380
environments.
Then when the trash dark starts coming,

2292
02:02:26,381 --> 02:02:27,214
they go,
oh yeah,

2293
02:02:27,330 --> 02:02:27,791
oh yeah,
oh,

2294
02:02:27,791 --> 02:02:28,870
okay,
that what's going to happen?

2295
02:02:28,990 --> 02:02:30,430
Fuck you bitch.
And then the,

2296
02:02:30,431 --> 02:02:35,020
and then you see them get excited by it 
and then you see them like saying,

2297
02:02:35,110 --> 02:02:35,651
oh,
okay,

2298
02:02:35,651 --> 02:02:37,960
now you've given me more motivation to 
fuck you up.

2299
02:02:38,350 --> 02:02:41,530
Whereas some people genuinely need to 
get dwarfed by this.

2300
02:02:41,770 --> 02:02:42,603
You think they get,
they get the pressure of not just being 

2301
02:02:47,141 --> 02:02:48,280
in conflict,
but some person,

2302
02:02:48,281 --> 02:02:49,114
but that person insulting them and 
verbal conflict and demeaning them and 

2303
02:02:53,021 --> 02:02:55,720
mocking them.
It haunts them.

2304
02:02:56,140 --> 02:02:58,960
It haunts them and it ruins them and 
they can't perform.

2305
02:02:59,170 --> 02:03:00,910
They go out and they fight.
They fight terrible.

2306
02:03:01,030 --> 02:03:03,700
It happens to a lot of fighters,
guys who were tough,

2307
02:03:03,701 --> 02:03:05,710
tough guys.
Something about the,

2308
02:03:05,880 --> 02:03:06,713
the verbal conflict and the abuse.
There's an emotional struggle that 

2309
02:03:09,731 --> 02:03:10,564
they're not prepared for.
They prepared 100% for this physical 

2310
02:03:12,911 --> 02:03:13,744
struggle,
but there's a certain aspect of someone 

2311
02:03:16,030 --> 02:03:16,863
literally hating them as a human,
like not thinking of them as a worthy 

2312
02:03:20,711 --> 02:03:23,080
competitor who they respect,
who they're ready to go to,

2313
02:03:23,081 --> 02:03:23,914
battle with.
And we'll shake hands first and 

2314
02:03:25,001 --> 02:03:25,834
afterwards we'll go have a beer together
after we beat the shit out of each 

2315
02:03:27,851 --> 02:03:29,730
other.
Now it's like you're,

2316
02:03:29,731 --> 02:03:31,210
you're a little pussy,
you're a bitch.

2317
02:03:31,211 --> 02:03:33,010
You shine.
It shouldn't even be here.

2318
02:03:33,160 --> 02:03:34,540
You're weak.
You're going to fall apart,

2319
02:03:34,541 --> 02:03:35,860
man.
You know you're going to fall.

2320
02:03:35,861 --> 02:03:38,260
Put your waiting to fall apart.
Just give me a neck.

2321
02:03:38,290 --> 02:03:38,920
Just give me a neck.

2322
02:03:38,920 --> 02:03:40,570
I'll choke you out.
Make it nice and easy.

2323
02:03:40,750 --> 02:03:45,750
And you see guys reacting to that,
these demons inside of them that these,

2324
02:03:45,790 --> 02:03:46,623
these are thoughts that do dance around 
the back of their brain and every day 

2325
02:03:49,781 --> 02:03:51,820
they're throwing water on it.
But every day they come back in,

2326
02:03:51,821 --> 02:03:54,010
the fucking embers are still smoldering 
shit.

2327
02:03:54,160 --> 02:03:54,993
And this guy's just pouring gasoline on 
that shit and it just takes over the 

2328
02:03:57,611 --> 02:03:58,660
consciousness.
You see them,

2329
02:03:58,780 --> 02:04:00,490
they can't sleep good.
You see them,

2330
02:04:00,491 --> 02:04:03,160
they look exhausted.
You see the day of the fight,

2331
02:04:03,161 --> 02:04:04,510
they look nervous.
They look,

2332
02:04:04,690 --> 02:04:07,690
they look really worried.
It'll look really worried.

2333
02:04:07,691 --> 02:04:08,524
This person's right.
That person is planted these seeds of 

2334
02:04:10,781 --> 02:04:11,614
doubt that are these invasive species 
plants that are choking out all the 

2335
02:04:14,591 --> 02:04:16,750
trees.
It's wild to see.

2336
02:04:17,050 --> 02:04:17,883
It's wild to see how the same words can 
have a completely different effect on 

2337
02:04:21,611 --> 02:04:22,444
different people.

2338
02:04:24,330 --> 02:04:25,163
So there you are.
It's a different kind of resistance 

2339
02:04:26,641 --> 02:04:27,270
training.

2340
02:04:27,270 --> 02:04:27,751
Yeah,
no,

2341
02:04:27,751 --> 02:04:28,584
there's definitely something to that.
There's definitely something to be 

2342
02:04:30,781 --> 02:04:33,870
around abusive people to being around.
I mean,

2343
02:04:33,871 --> 02:04:36,230
you get accustomed to stuff.
You get you,

2344
02:04:36,270 --> 02:04:40,920
people are very,
they're very malleable now you can,

2345
02:04:40,950 --> 02:04:43,740
you can get accustom to really shitty 
behavior.

2346
02:04:43,770 --> 02:04:46,170
I mean,
this is not like,

2347
02:04:47,120 --> 02:04:50,010
this is what's got to happen when you're
in war,

2348
02:04:50,460 --> 02:04:53,070
you get accustomed to it,
you get accustomed to violence,

2349
02:04:53,071 --> 02:04:56,460
you get accustomed to all that.
And one of the more difficult things for

2350
02:04:56,461 --> 02:04:59,810
people postwar is coming back into a,
uh,

2351
02:04:59,930 --> 02:05:01,320
a kind,
gentle,

2352
02:05:01,321 --> 02:05:04,270
boring world.
It's almost like they,

2353
02:05:04,940 --> 02:05:05,671
they,
I mean,

2354
02:05:05,671 --> 02:05:06,690
that's hurt locker,
right?

2355
02:05:07,080 --> 02:05:09,150
They,
they'd appreciate the danger.

2356
02:05:09,660 --> 02:05:12,920
They appreciate that.
The thrill of it all is almost more,

2357
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:15,810
more appealing than the absolute lack of
thrill,

2358
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:16,673
the thrill of potential violence and 
death and all the horrors that you'd 

2359
02:05:19,701 --> 02:05:22,680
come into contact with.
It's almost preferable.

2360
02:05:25,270 --> 02:05:25,960
Did you read,
uh,

2361
02:05:25,960 --> 02:05:27,820
Sebastian younger's tribe?
No.

2362
02:05:28,240 --> 02:05:29,200
That's a new one,
right?

2363
02:05:29,440 --> 02:05:30,880
Yeah,
it's great book,

2364
02:05:30,910 --> 02:05:34,160
but it's about that.
It's about the why,

2365
02:05:34,490 --> 02:05:37,960
you know,
being in these intense,

2366
02:05:38,530 --> 02:05:39,363
like really dangerous but crackling with
energy environments produce some of the 

2367
02:05:47,621 --> 02:05:52,621
happiest moments for these people's 
lives and that post post war,

2368
02:05:53,710 --> 02:05:54,543
like they have an incredibly difficult 
job to sort of reintegrating to normal 

2369
02:05:59,530 --> 02:06:01,150
flats is society.
Yeah,

2370
02:06:01,510 --> 02:06:02,680
I could see that.
Totally.

2371
02:06:04,750 --> 02:06:06,220
What time is it?
Three 15.

2372
02:06:06,430 --> 02:06:07,480
Let's wrap this up,
chuck.

2373
02:06:07,640 --> 02:06:08,770
Gotta.
Listen,

2374
02:06:08,771 --> 02:06:10,660

I really appreciate you being here.

2375
02:06:10,661 --> 02:06:12,400
I really appreciate picking your brain 
and,

2376
02:06:12,440 --> 02:06:14,370
uh,
I thank you very much man,

2377
02:06:14,550 --> 02:06:15,383

all your writing and all your work and 

2378
02:06:17,351 --> 02:06:18,250

Well,

2379
02:06:18,251 --> 02:06:19,120
yeah.
All right.

2380
02:06:19,210 --> 02:06:20,500
Hey,
thanks for the plane ticket.

2381
02:06:21,220 --> 02:06:23,080
My pleasure.
Um,

2382
02:06:23,140 --> 02:06:25,060
when can we expect this book when you,
uh,

2383
02:06:25,120 --> 02:06:27,370
when you get in,
this is going to be done.

2384
02:06:28,620 --> 02:06:30,750
This is this book.
This book is just,

2385
02:06:30,751 --> 02:06:31,950
uh,
is,

2386
02:06:31,951 --> 02:06:34,050
uh,
pages and an o book right now.

2387
02:06:34,051 --> 02:06:36,060
This is not for next year.
It's fight club.

2388
02:06:36,061 --> 02:06:40,020
Three next year will probably be a big 
fat writing book from me.

2389
02:06:40,380 --> 02:06:45,300
And this book will won't be until 20,
20.

2390
02:06:45,840 --> 02:06:46,950
Yeah,
two years.

2391
02:06:47,120 --> 02:06:48,540
Alright.
Thank you.

2392
02:06:48,660 --> 02:06:49,560
Thank you.
Appreciate it.

2393
02:06:59,480 --> 02:07:00,313
Okay.
