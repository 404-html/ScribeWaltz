1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:05,520
No abandoned three,
two

2
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:10,640
and we're live.
What's up buddy?

3
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:11,710
Hey,
how are you?

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:15,310
I'm very sorry about that.
A sound of the thing in the background.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,470
Ladies and gentlemen here.
That was wasn't.

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,690
That's annoying.
We'll shut that off.

7
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:21,750
Sure,
go ahead.

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,710
Okay.
Can you shut it off?

9
00:00:22,711 --> 00:00:24,570
Jamie?
Um,

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,900
dad is because there was,
there was smoke in this room and the

11
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:29,350
Godfather has a,
uh,

12
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,030
an issue with the smoke.
How'd you get over your asthma?

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,080
Uh,
around puberty it often subsides,

14
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,870
especially if you're quite athletic,
which I was.

15
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,410
And then it completely went away by
about 13 and only came back by about 25,

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,350
but now I'm not full blown asthmatic.
Only when I get sick,

17
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:49,981
if I,
let's say,

18
00:00:49,981 --> 00:00:52,800
get a cold,
it will migrate to my chest.

19
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,770
Turned into bronchitis.
And what will take you four days to

20
00:00:55,771 --> 00:00:58,170
fight?
Might take me a month of whooping cough.

21
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,040
That's why I'm really careful about not
getting a quote.

22
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:04,050
You know,
you must be a hand washer.

23
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,370
Well,
that's why when I came out of the

24
00:01:05,371 --> 00:01:07,650
bathroom,
my instinct was to tell Jamie as I was

25
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:10,440
shaking his hand,
I washed my hands because I'm always

26
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,690
careful about checking other people's
hands.

27
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,430
I'd like to extend them the same
courtesy.

28
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:15,121
Yeah,
man.

29
00:01:15,121 --> 00:01:18,960
I shake some people's hands and it's
like they just dumped it in the pool.

30
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,280
It's some people like they get so sweaty
and you shake their hand.

31
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:23,911
You Go,
well,

32
00:01:23,911 --> 00:01:26,070
okay,
but what's going on with his hand?

33
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,210
Like what kind of weird bacteria?
I read this article that was saying that

34
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:32,450
water bottles,
when you reuse water bottle,

35
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,750
they've tested them and they say that
there's less bacteria on dog toys.

36
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,150
It's pretty bad.
Well,

37
00:01:39,151 --> 00:01:42,720
that's why by the way,
I've resorted to fist bumping because

38
00:01:42,721 --> 00:01:45,420
I'm cool,
but it just reduces the amount of germ

39
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,300
transfer from one person to the other by
just going like this,

40
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,120
but don't you think that that
compromises your immune system by not

41
00:01:51,121 --> 00:01:52,950
exposing it to a lot of different
things?

42
00:01:52,951 --> 00:01:55,530
There is actually research on this right
from an illusionary medicine.

43
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,920
Kids who grow up in very sterile
environments end up suffering from

44
00:01:58,921 --> 00:02:01,470
greater respiratory ailments,
precisely because their system hasn't

45
00:02:01,471 --> 00:02:02,670
been kicked up.
Yeah,

46
00:02:02,671 --> 00:02:05,520
I believe that.
I rarely get sick and I shake a lot of

47
00:02:05,521 --> 00:02:07,500
hands,
but I know a lot of people that don't

48
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:09,570
and they're kind of sick all the time.
Like I don't want to get sick.

49
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,700
I'm like,
but maybe that's what's going on.

50
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,700
Maybe with French kiss later after the
other exciting.

51
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,440
Don't you threatened me with a good
time.

52
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,610
It's,
um,

53
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,450
I think it's also really important.
I don't know how much you partake of

54
00:02:21,451 --> 00:02:22,110
this,
but uh,

55
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:26,190
to consume probiotics,
do you would eat acidophilus or yogurt

56
00:02:26,191 --> 00:02:29,160
or yogurt?
I do like Kimchi.

57
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,790
I don't do it by design.
I think maybe just those preferences are

58
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:36,390
healthy and so I'm,
I'm happy to hear that they are good

59
00:02:36,391 --> 00:02:39,390
probiotics and for grapplers in
particular,

60
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,910
grapplers are very,
um,

61
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,940
particular about the consumption of
probiotics because we get a lot of

62
00:02:44,941 --> 00:02:49,530
ringworm and I'm also a staph infections
too.

63
00:02:49,531 --> 00:02:51,960
There's a lot of different infections
that people can get from.

64
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,810
Especially ringworm,
know staph infections is really more for

65
00:02:54,811 --> 00:02:56,070
an,
from an open cut.

66
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,650
But uh,
having healthy skin flora is very

67
00:02:58,651 --> 00:03:00,100
important.
Why all

68
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,780
you kids listening don't use
antibiotics.

69
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:03,580
So it's not,
it's not the right way to go.

70
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:08,380
There's a lot of healthy soaps that are
used like tea tree oil and eucalyptus

71
00:03:08,381 --> 00:03:10,420
that are really good for you that are
probiotic.

72
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,910
Right?
Keep the idea of warm and mind because

73
00:03:12,911 --> 00:03:16,810
later I'd like to talk about brain worms
and how it relates to a condition that

74
00:03:16,811 --> 00:03:19,840
is affecting the west.
We can get into it now or you mean like

75
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:22,330
Toxoplasma?
That'll be one.

76
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,760
There's other ones.
There are many others.

77
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,470
Do you want to get into that now?
Sure.

78
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,190
Okay.
So that's the polsky on.

79
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,750
I know know I should write to them
because it was amazing.

80
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,970
He is amazing.
I wrote to him a while ago,

81
00:03:33,971 --> 00:03:35,800
maybe a year and a half or two years
ago,

82
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:38,140
but at the time he to come on my show.
Uh,

83
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:40,780
but he was very busy writing a few
books,

84
00:03:40,781 --> 00:03:42,900
which I'm guessing he's probably done
with now.

85
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,500
Yeah.
Well he was busy then.

86
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:47,410
We had a meet him in La,
in his hotel room,

87
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,450
and we had to film.
We only had an hour.

88
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,330
He literally landed,
got into his hotel room.

89
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:55,120
We went with him as he opened up the
door to his hotel.

90
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:58,540
We sat down with them and it's just a
little table and chair there is

91
00:03:58,541 --> 00:03:59,820
fantastic.
Yeah.

92
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,800
Yeah.
So basically I argued that in the same

93
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:07,630
way that there are all sorts of animals
that once they are infected with this

94
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,090
brain warm and they are different
instantiations of it,

95
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,680
uh,
they,

96
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,420
they,
they become zombified,

97
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:14,110
right?
I mean,

98
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:18,010
just to give you another example,
the spider wasp will sting the spider,

99
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,770
which,
which is much bigger than it rendering

100
00:04:20,771 --> 00:04:23,260
it.
Zombified then carries it into its

101
00:04:23,261 --> 00:04:28,150
burrow,
lays its eggs on the invivo spider,

102
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,570
and then when the eggs hatch,
they eat it in Vivo.

103
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,580
And I argued that the,
the political correctness is akin to the

104
00:04:36,581 --> 00:04:40,810
spider wasps sting because it's
zombifies us into walking quietly

105
00:04:40,811 --> 00:04:43,800
through the abyss of infinite darkness a
while.

106
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:47,200
Horrible things are happening around us,
but why we think that we're doing the

107
00:04:47,201 --> 00:04:48,910
right thing.
While we think that yet we know we're

108
00:04:48,911 --> 00:04:50,740
not,
we're being not racist and good and

109
00:04:50,741 --> 00:04:51,800
progressive,
uh,

110
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,740
but,
but to go back to the brain warm idea,

111
00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:58,741
so I coined the term not to be cute,
but to actually name this collective

112
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:01,660
condition.
I called it ostrich per acidic syndrome.

113
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,310
Yeah.
We've talked about this before.

114
00:05:03,311 --> 00:05:05,020
We talk about.
We know that that's a myth.

115
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:05,711
Well,
yeah,

116
00:05:05,711 --> 00:05:06,544
yeah.
That the Boston.

117
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,250
Because it's become just a metaphor for
her.

118
00:05:09,251 --> 00:05:10,084
Yeah,
absolutely.

119
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:13,380
The Myth being folks that ostriches
don't really stick their head in the

120
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,710
exactly.
Uh,

121
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,420
and,
and it's,

122
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,370
it's really taken on a life of its own.

123
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,650
At this point.
I'm actually thinking of studying this

124
00:05:20,651 --> 00:05:22,840
scientifically,
not just as something that I talk about

125
00:05:22,841 --> 00:05:27,550
in my public engagement.
What is it that causes some people to be

126
00:05:27,551 --> 00:05:32,551
more likely to be arrested enticed by
the types of mindsets that would cause

127
00:05:33,221 --> 00:05:35,410
you to suffer from ostrich parasitic
syndrome.

128
00:05:35,411 --> 00:05:37,930
So a classic example would be,
which I guess we'll we'll get into

129
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:43,810
how much evidence do you need to see
around the world that there might be

130
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:48,370
some religious ideology that is somewhat
problematic and antithetical to secular

131
00:05:48,371 --> 00:05:52,570
liberal modern values.
How much information or what is the type

132
00:05:52,571 --> 00:05:56,110
of information that you would need to
see before you are able to arrive to

133
00:05:56,111 --> 00:05:58,130
such a conclusion.
And so one

134
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:03,130
of the things I'm thinking of doing is
to formally quantify a score of ops,

135
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:05,420
how much somebody suffers from won't be
as,

136
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:09,980
as a type of mindset and what are some
predictors that could help us understand

137
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:13,520
who is more or less likely to be the
afflicted by this mindset?

138
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,950
Well,
there's certain people that just never

139
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:20,720
want to hurt anyone's feelings except
when they think that it is within their

140
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:23,780
rights to attack that person because
that person is somehow or another

141
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:27,380
victimizing someone else and then
there'll be far more egregious than the

142
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:30,380
original offense.
Did you know about that guy that in

143
00:06:30,381 --> 00:06:31,970
Canada that's getting sued?
Well,

144
00:06:31,971 --> 00:06:34,970
he,
the Human Rights Council find him

145
00:06:34,971 --> 00:06:39,100
$12,000 because you walked into the
apartment that he owned with shoes on

146
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,050
because there was a Muslim family living
there.

147
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:45,530
Um,
their lease was up and he was looking to

148
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:49,190
rent the apartment.
They stopped responding to his texts and

149
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:53,360
so he opened up the apartment to show
this,

150
00:06:53,361 --> 00:06:55,700
uh,
this apartment that he owns and because

151
00:06:55,701 --> 00:06:59,360
he walked into a building that he owns
with his shoes on,

152
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:04,630
he has to pay them $12,000 for failing
to accommodate their religious practices

153
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:07,670
while showing their apartment to
perspective tenants.

154
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,710
That's crazy.
Welcome to Canada.

155
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,370
We just had a thing called the motion
and one.

156
00:07:13,371 --> 00:07:13,701
Oh,
three.

157
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:15,170
Are you familiar with this?
Look at this.

158
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:16,580
Look at this statement that,
I'm sorry to interrupt you,

159
00:07:16,581 --> 00:07:21,581
but the human rights tribunal of Ontario
also found that he harassed them and

160
00:07:21,981 --> 00:07:25,250
created a poisoned housing environment.
It's right.

161
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,710
There you go.
Because he refused to remove issues.

162
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,750
Some sensibilities are more equal than
others,

163
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,040
but that is just what,
why is it that people are so.

164
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,890
Especially in,
particularly with Muslims,

165
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:41,480
like you'll notice that there's a lot of
people that are,

166
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,960
they will accuse everyone of
Islamophobia yet they'll shit on

167
00:07:44,961 --> 00:07:45,794
Christians.
Yeah.

168
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,580
It's really common like they don't,
it's not that they believe in religious

169
00:07:49,581 --> 00:07:52,970
freedom,
it's that they have like a pet cause and

170
00:07:52,971 --> 00:07:57,971
the pet causes almost like being a and
to a lot of far right people who are

171
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,520
really terrified of Muslims,
like they're trying to like figure out

172
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,340
how to,
how to balance that out with their own

173
00:08:04,341 --> 00:08:06,350
ridiculous leftwing version of it.

174
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,570
Well,
I think there are two elements to it.

175
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,080
One is that they're just afraid to
criticize because bumps,

176
00:08:12,081 --> 00:08:15,950
because they are greater repercussions
to do so than to criticize seventh day

177
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,260
adventist.
So just from a very basic sort of

178
00:08:18,261 --> 00:08:20,570
survival instinct,
but I think secondly,

179
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,520
which is kind of part of the ostrich
parasitics internal,

180
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:26,120
not speaking of.
There are all sort of erroneous ideas

181
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,310
that people have been infected with.
Uh,

182
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:29,020
you know,
the,

183
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:29,800
the,
the,

184
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,140
the Muslim religion is a religion for
the downtrodden,

185
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:37,280
the Brown people,
the exotic other and so to,

186
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:42,460
to criticize them when they are a
hapless exotic minority is simply racist

187
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:47,060
and sexist and people believe that even
though most of the countries that these

188
00:08:47,061 --> 00:08:48,860
people are coming from,
when they come to the west,

189
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,880
not only are they the majority,
they're almost the exclusive majority

190
00:08:52,881 --> 00:08:55,410
like so,
so they are out of I think 56 countries

191
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:56,190
that constitute

192
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:59,730
the OIC,
the Organization of Islamic cooperation,

193
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,050
something like 29 or 30 countries that
exclusively Islamic.

194
00:09:04,051 --> 00:09:06,690
They are no longer any religious
minorities.

195
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:08,760
It's in the order of 99 point nine
something.

196
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,120
So to argue that people who come from
these countries are,

197
00:09:12,121 --> 00:09:13,830
you know,
religious minorities,

198
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,020
religious minorities when they come to
the west,

199
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,560
but they're all coming from countries
where not nevermind that they're the

200
00:09:19,561 --> 00:09:21,990
majority.
They've never interacted with someone

201
00:09:21,991 --> 00:09:25,440
who did not share their faith.
I don't think people understand that if

202
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:29,460
that happens here,
like you can't turn back from that

203
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,070
without violence.
Right?

204
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:31,904
Like if,
if,

205
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,630
I mean,
I'm not saying that it would happen in

206
00:09:33,631 --> 00:09:37,170
the United States,
but the fact that it can happen anywhere

207
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,540
means it can happen everywhere.
I mean,

208
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:40,730
it really can.
I mean it's,

209
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,080
it's a,
it's a big reach on my part to say that

210
00:09:43,081 --> 00:09:45,300
because there is no evidence whatsoever
that it's going to happen here,

211
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,750
but if you really look at some of the
countries that are suffering under this

212
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:53,400
really oppressive religious ideologies
where women aren't allowed to drive,

213
00:09:53,401 --> 00:09:56,220
where they have to wear a covering all
over their body,

214
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,980
that signifies that they're a part of
this religious sect.

215
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,890
Like if that,
if someone tried to do that today,

216
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,030
like if you had some blonde haired,
blue eyed guy that made all women wear a

217
00:10:06,031 --> 00:10:09,300
certain outfit and they weren't allowed
to drive and they weren't allowed to

218
00:10:09,301 --> 00:10:12,000
have the same rights,
how many people would be standing up for

219
00:10:12,001 --> 00:10:12,960
them?
That's incredible.

220
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,170
Especially if it was a new thing.
It,

221
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,230
there's something about old things like
old ideologies in legitimacy.

222
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,210
So strange.
What is that?

223
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,670
Uh,
while it's exactly what you said,

224
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,590
you take an idea that someone holds.
If he doesn't cloak cloak under the robe

225
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,440
of religion,
you commit them to a psychiatric

226
00:10:31,441 --> 00:10:33,060
institution.
If he says,

227
00:10:33,061 --> 00:10:33,201
no,
no,

228
00:10:33,201 --> 00:10:33,391
no,
no,

229
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:37,560
but this belief as part of my religion,
suddenly you get a free pass.

230
00:10:37,561 --> 00:10:39,900
That's grotesque,
but to speak to your point about,

231
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,930
well that you are stretching about it
happening in the United States.

232
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,310
You're not stretching it at all.

233
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,320
As a matter of fact,
I've argued at,

234
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:47,580
for example,
when the,

235
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:51,750
when trump won,
that if you look at a longterm view of

236
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,980
the issue of Islamic immigration,
if,

237
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,800
if,
if what you focus on is,

238
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,100
uh,
do we have the proper vetting processes

239
00:10:59,101 --> 00:11:01,290
to stop terrorists,
isis terrorists from coming in.

240
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,870
That's a very short term view of the
problem.

241
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:08,550
But if you recognize that societies will
take often,

242
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,310
very,
very long time before they become

243
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,870
islamized.
It's not as though every single country

244
00:11:12,871 --> 00:11:16,590
that today is Islamic became
instantaneously overnight Islamic.

245
00:11:16,591 --> 00:11:19,020
In some cases it wasn't very,
very quick invasion.

246
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:23,070
In other cases it took 500 years before
the demographic reality shifted.

247
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:26,970
And so yes,
if you look at it from the perspective

248
00:11:26,971 --> 00:11:27,810
of 10,
20,

249
00:11:27,811 --> 00:11:29,010
50,
100 years,

250
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,870
the US stands no threat,
but take a longterm view.

251
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,840
I love this quote from I think it was
who said it,

252
00:11:36,841 --> 00:11:41,580
that the United States have all the
clocks and watches we have all the time

253
00:11:41,581 --> 00:11:43,080
in the world.
In other words,

254
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,240
in Shatila.
Eventually God willing,

255
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,540
we will conquer you.
So this is the right way to look at this

256
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,780
issue.
Do you wish to have a society become

257
00:11:51,781 --> 00:11:54,100
more islamized or less?
Let me draw

258
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,330
another analogy.
Uh,

259
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,860
at the end of every day,
you can weigh yourself and one of three

260
00:11:59,861 --> 00:12:03,320
things is going to happen.
You've either lost weight that they get

261
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,740
a weight,
did not change a single ounce or you've

262
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:08,770
put on weight.
So let's analogize this with Islam.

263
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,580
When Islam comes into a place,
either the society gets better,

264
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,130
nothing changes,
or it gets worse.

265
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:20,410
Do we have enough data at this point,
after 1400 years to suggest that we can

266
00:12:20,411 --> 00:12:22,750
try to bet what will happen to a
society?

267
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,450
The answer regrettably is yes.
Again,

268
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,490
I hate to have to preface,
of course,

269
00:12:27,491 --> 00:12:31,360
most Muslims are lovely and peaceful and
wish to simply raise their children,

270
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:35,110
but Islam as an ideology when it comes
into a new society,

271
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,640
is that a good thing?
If yes,

272
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,010
let's alternate Islamic.
If no,

273
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,920
then maybe we should have an honest
conversation about this and honest

274
00:12:41,921 --> 00:12:45,370
conversation is what's really important
because these things get so emotionally

275
00:12:45,371 --> 00:12:50,371
charged like the infamous Ben Affleck,
Sam Harris Debacle on Bill Maher show,

276
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:56,260
but that to me is a perfect example
because Sam speaks in such a measured

277
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,450
tone and he's so educated about it.

278
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,770
He's not making these big gigantic
leaps,

279
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:07,270
but people love to jump on him and call
racism.

280
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,910
He sent me some video that I just
watched the other day.

281
00:13:09,911 --> 00:13:14,590
We were a bunch of people are just
taking complete out of context

282
00:13:14,591 --> 00:13:17,440
statements,
attributing to him as being like,

283
00:13:17,441 --> 00:13:18,700
this is what he believes on.
Things.

284
00:13:18,701 --> 00:13:22,480
When if you listen to the full extent of
the conversation,

285
00:13:22,481 --> 00:13:26,410
he's literally saying like that.
I'm going to say something here that

286
00:13:26,411 --> 00:13:30,490
could be taken out of context,
but what I'm saying is imagine if

287
00:13:30,491 --> 00:13:33,640
someone was saying this right,
how do you respond to that?

288
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:36,330
And they use that as a statement.
I mean there's.

289
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,530
There's so much of that going on.
There's so much,

290
00:13:38,531 --> 00:13:39,750
so dishonest.
Well there's,

291
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,970
there's this weird not me thing that
they're doing.

292
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,720
It's like they,
they're,

293
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,640
I'm not the racist.
He's racist and they get very.

294
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,310
Your racist,
like the Ben Affleck thing,

295
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,220
like he was like,
that is so gross that it's so racist.

296
00:13:54,221 --> 00:13:58,300
Like instead of just discussing this
conversation,

297
00:13:58,301 --> 00:14:02,890
I'm discussing this especially on the
bill Maher show because that shows all

298
00:14:02,891 --> 00:14:04,420
those shows is not to criticize that
show,

299
00:14:04,421 --> 00:14:06,730
but all those shows,
we have a panel of six people.

300
00:14:06,731 --> 00:14:09,520
What you see is a bunch of people
waiting to say something and they have

301
00:14:09,521 --> 00:14:13,750
to jump in and it's almost like they
have to be salacious or they have to be

302
00:14:13,751 --> 00:14:16,210
outrageous just to get heard.
You know,

303
00:14:16,211 --> 00:14:17,450
like everyone.
It's it.

304
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,090
Those kinds of shows promote this sort
of disingenuous communication because

305
00:14:22,091 --> 00:14:24,040
you have to.
You can't be polite like you and I can

306
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,360
be polite.
It's just you and I,

307
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,230
we can talk and we can have these long
form conversations,

308
00:14:29,231 --> 00:14:34,231
but on that show,
you don't have the time to unpack what's

309
00:14:34,511 --> 00:14:39,220
wrong with all ideologies,
all things that tell you how to think.

310
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:43,300
Forget about whether or not you think it
came from Jesus or the Prophet Muhammad

311
00:14:43,301 --> 00:14:47,200
or Joseph Smith.
Anytime there's a doctrine that tells

312
00:14:47,201 --> 00:14:50,570
you how to think because of some
mystical presence,

313
00:14:50,571 --> 00:14:55,571
some God or Deity or prophet who has
gotten the wisdom of the universe and

314
00:14:56,151 --> 00:14:59,420
you met at must not question it,
and women have to wear veils and dress

315
00:14:59,421 --> 00:15:02,510
up like beekeepers and I mean all that
stuff is very,

316
00:15:02,511 --> 00:15:06,830
very problematic because people are
prone for whatever reason.

317
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,800
I mean some.
I guess it's something that goes back to

318
00:15:09,801 --> 00:15:12,680
tribalism and Alpha male chimpanzee
behavior.

319
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,590
We're prone to follow,
prone to follow leaders.

320
00:15:15,591 --> 00:15:17,690
I mean,
it makes it easier and that's one of the

321
00:15:17,691 --> 00:15:19,190
things you're seeing here.
Well,

322
00:15:19,191 --> 00:15:23,780
what's amazing is that it's one thing to
attack Sam because of the game of

323
00:15:23,781 --> 00:15:26,120
identity politics.
He scores really poorly,

324
00:15:26,121 --> 00:15:28,460
right?
He's a southern California and white

325
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:32,750
male who doesn't speak any of the
languages that matter Arabic or so on.

326
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:35,090
And his parents had money.
That's his parents had money.

327
00:15:35,091 --> 00:15:37,520
So I've loved that.
So your parents had money,

328
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:38,720
you her.
Exactly.

329
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:42,590
I only recently found out maybe a year
or a year and a half ago when I met him

330
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:47,030
last,
that his mother is the creator of golden

331
00:15:47,031 --> 00:15:47,864
girls is,
you know.

332
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,823
No,
I didn't even know that.

333
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,260
And I actually,
I,

334
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:54,200
I just looked at one of the golden girls
that was rerunning and uc,

335
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,450
I think it's Susan Harris or something.
But anyways,

336
00:15:56,451 --> 00:15:59,540
uh,
someone like me who comes from the

337
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,750
Middle East who escape that reality,
someone like Ayaan Hirsi Ali and I had

338
00:16:02,751 --> 00:16:04,640
many people on my show.
Uh,

339
00:16:04,641 --> 00:16:07,520
I don't know how much you followed,
but a lot of people who've all escaped

340
00:16:07,521 --> 00:16:10,490
from this world,
either they still considered themselves

341
00:16:10,491 --> 00:16:12,350
Muslim but know not,
you know,

342
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:16,940
Muslim light or ex Muslims.
In many cases they will be attached.

343
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:17,840
So imagine,
you know,

344
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:21,890
so there was some woman who went to
Wellesley college who doesn't know

345
00:16:21,891 --> 00:16:24,500
anything about Islam,
short of whatever she learned in her

346
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:29,000
bullshit progressive course.
She would lecture to us what true Islam

347
00:16:29,001 --> 00:16:30,980
is,
not the people who lived under it,

348
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:34,610
not the people who ran away from it.
She knows better because.

349
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,211
So it's,
it's,

350
00:16:35,211 --> 00:16:36,320
it's really,
it's grotesque.

351
00:16:36,321 --> 00:16:38,150
It's infuriating.
It's stunning.

352
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,810
And it's also confusing because like
when,

353
00:16:40,811 --> 00:16:44,930
when you see them do it,
like anytime someone goes so far

354
00:16:44,931 --> 00:16:47,640
overboard that objective reasoning is
out the window and you're,

355
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,690
you know,
you're so committed to whatever position

356
00:16:50,691 --> 00:16:53,360
that you're in that you can't look at
both sides of it.

357
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:54,080
I mean,
I,

358
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:59,080
I could see why a lot of religious
traditions would be comforting to people

359
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:02,410
remind them of where they came from,
give them pride of their homeland and

360
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,130
give them a personal good feeling.

361
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,890
They're connected to some sort of an
ancient tradition,

362
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,200
right?
As long as it's not oppressing other

363
00:17:09,201 --> 00:17:12,410
human beings.
And there's gotta be some.

364
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,700
I mean I actually cultural patterns of
behavior that people do,

365
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:20,210
like celebrations like Oktoberfest or
something like that.

366
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,620
Those things promote some sort of pride
like I guess a pride in Germany and

367
00:17:24,621 --> 00:17:28,460
their beer making and all that stuff
without oppressing people,

368
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:29,780
you know.
But by the way,

369
00:17:29,781 --> 00:17:34,640
this is a good segue to what you're
talking about is something that is

370
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,290
upsetting me these days increasingly so.
So some people are now trying to draw a

371
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:44,090
distinction between Islam and Islamism.
The reason why I mentioned this is

372
00:17:44,091 --> 00:17:47,810
because Islam has two elements.
There's the spiritual part,

373
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,100
right?
Which is,

374
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,220
you know,
Kinda

375
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,950
like your October fest that prayed this
way,

376
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,260
believe in a god in a monotheistic God
and so on.

377
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,920
But then within Islam is a much larger
component of politics,

378
00:18:02,671 --> 00:18:05,670
political Islam.
So when you say something like,

379
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,391
well,
you know,

380
00:18:06,391 --> 00:18:09,900
we should be attacking Islam.
Islam as if it's something that is

381
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:13,170
outside of Islam,
that's simply false Islam.

382
00:18:13,171 --> 00:18:15,570
Islam is Islam,
right around the one,

383
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,350
the prime minister of Turkey,
and I can quote many other,

384
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:23,820
uh,
Islamic experts said Islam is Islam.

385
00:18:23,821 --> 00:18:25,710
The term moderate Islam,
Islam,

386
00:18:25,711 --> 00:18:27,600
Islam,
and all these other qualifiers are

387
00:18:27,601 --> 00:18:29,340
nonsensical.
Now,

388
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:34,341
the reason why that upsets me is because
it grants people a false sense of

389
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,650
security and hope.
You know Islam is wonderful,

390
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,830
but we need to attack this separate
thing called Islamism.

391
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:43,620
Well from day one,
1400 years ago,

392
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,140
Islam was Islam,
Islam.

393
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,370
Now that doesn't mean that there isn't a
spiritual element.

394
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:51,780
That doesn't mean that most Muslims just
want to practice the spiritual part,

395
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,320
but there is no set of doctrines and as
separate book called radicalized Islam,

396
00:18:57,471 --> 00:19:00,600
Islam,
it all comes from the same texts.

397
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,940
It comes from the Koran,
it comes from the Heidi's,

398
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,310
and it comes from the CEO at the
biography of Muhammad,

399
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:09,390
so,
so this kind of false narrative that

400
00:19:09,391 --> 00:19:12,960
people are promulgating so that they
seem as though they're not frontally

401
00:19:12,961 --> 00:19:16,710
attacking religion while laudable,
while Nice,

402
00:19:16,711 --> 00:19:20,220
I get that reflex,
it's false and so again,

403
00:19:20,221 --> 00:19:22,590
to go back to our point of talking
honestly,

404
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,360
we need to talk.
Honestly,

405
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:28,020
there's only Islam.
Some people choose to practice it fully.

406
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:30,450
Some people choose to ignore the ugly
parts,

407
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,000
but there is no such thing as Islamism.
Islam.

408
00:19:33,001 --> 00:19:37,080
Islam is part of Islam.
Now you're a person that goes out of

409
00:19:37,081 --> 00:19:38,410
your way to say,
no,

410
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:43,110
we're not talking about the kind sweet
Islamic people that just want to raise

411
00:19:43,111 --> 00:19:44,280
their children now.

412
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:49,310
So how do you sort of manage those two
ideas that they're the same?

413
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,530
Like when the term radical Islam gets
thrown around,

414
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:57,090
right?
So radical Islam simply means I really

415
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,430
take my Islam seriously,
right?

416
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,070
It's,
let's draw a silly analogy.

417
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:07,430
If I don't eat pork in my radical Jew or
am I a Jew right now,

418
00:20:07,951 --> 00:20:11,910
I happen to be Jewish.
I simply ignore the kosher edict that

419
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:13,230
says,
don't eat pork.

420
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:14,880
That does.
Why do you do that though?

421
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,960
Because in my case,
I simply identify as Jewish in the sense

422
00:20:18,961 --> 00:20:22,170
that at Judaism is a multi attribute
identity.

423
00:20:22,171 --> 00:20:25,500
It includes a shared history,
shared lineage,

424
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:29,690
a shit kind of erase what some could
argue it's array,

425
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,750
so it's considered in a lot of people's
ideas so I could still in the same way

426
00:20:33,751 --> 00:20:38,580
that you might identify as coming from
Boston and there's a shared history from

427
00:20:38,581 --> 00:20:42,330
all people who grew up around the time
that you grew up in Boston and there was

428
00:20:42,331 --> 00:20:44,880
a sense of affiliation and tribalism.

429
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:49,360
Would that reality being,
as far as I'm concerned and for most

430
00:20:49,361 --> 00:20:50,740
Jews,
is exactly that.

431
00:20:50,741 --> 00:20:54,820
We don't necessarily take the religious
elements very seriously.

432
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,800
Now.
That doesn't mean that we are practicing

433
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:01,890
a light Judaism or non-radical Judaism
where simply ignoring those parts of

434
00:21:02,771 --> 00:21:06,760
Judaism that we choose to ignore,
so there is no such thing as radical

435
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:09,730
Islam.
There are no books called radical Islam.

436
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,990
There is a set of doctrines called Islam
and then I could do what's called

437
00:21:13,991 --> 00:21:16,930
cafeteria Islam,
which is I pick and choose the parts

438
00:21:16,931 --> 00:21:19,000
that I wished to adhere to.
So again,

439
00:21:19,001 --> 00:21:22,990
the discourse as a false narrative.
I understand the reason for it because

440
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:28,050
people find it rather Gauche to attack
frontally it religion at least to attack

441
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,310
Islam.
So they have to.

442
00:21:30,311 --> 00:21:31,770
I call this the,
the,

443
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:35,140
the ISM magic eucharistic rite.
Your ad isn't to something.

444
00:21:35,141 --> 00:21:35,890
It makes it bad.

445
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:40,020
Islam is good.
Islamism is bad for you.

446
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:42,340
Um,
I would like to defend you if there's a

447
00:21:42,341 --> 00:21:44,890
lot of people that are listening right
now or offer up some,

448
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,540
not,
not even defend you,

449
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:51,541
but offer up some information.
Like if you grew up in a place where

450
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:55,420
being Jewish was lethal,
I mean you,

451
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:57,640
your life was threatened.
Started on the,

452
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,630
when the civil war broke out,
prior to that you could live in Lebanon

453
00:22:01,631 --> 00:22:03,280
as a do.
People knew that we were Jewish,

454
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:05,890
but know your place Jew.
That by the way,

455
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:08,610
is something that I explained when,
when discussing on,

456
00:22:08,611 --> 00:22:09,970
I'm not sure if we've discussed this on
the show,

457
00:22:09,971 --> 00:22:13,330
but it might be worth repeating as we
discussed your past in Lebanon.

458
00:22:13,331 --> 00:22:16,120
How you so,
but so do you know what a dummy is?

459
00:22:16,121 --> 00:22:17,940
Have you heard that term?
Yeah,

460
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,780
you explained it,
but please do again just so dim.

461
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:25,860
Me As a third class citizen comes out of
Koranic edicts that basically said that

462
00:22:27,511 --> 00:22:31,390
when when Islam comes into a society,
you basically have three choices.

463
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:34,240
If you're not a Muslim,
you can either convert,

464
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:38,710
you could either get killed or if you
are people of the book,

465
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:42,220
meaning Christians and Jews,
meaning people of the book that you're

466
00:22:42,221 --> 00:22:44,920
also monotheistic here also from
Abrahamic faith.

467
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:49,450
Then you could live as a DM,
me and then me as a protected class,

468
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:53,050
protected and quotes we tolerate you and
in order to tolerate,

469
00:22:53,051 --> 00:22:58,051
you were going to remind you repeatedly
have your subservient position.

470
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:02,290
Now at different points across the last
1400 years.

471
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:07,480
That mechanism was either instituted
very forcefully or more lightly so in

472
00:23:07,481 --> 00:23:10,090
the context of Lebanon,
which is which was a very progressive

473
00:23:10,091 --> 00:23:12,400
and modern country in the Middle Eastern
context.

474
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:17,020
There wasn't somebody knocking on our
door and loving the pay us or else we're

475
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:21,460
going to rape your daughters,
but you didn't wear a big star of David

476
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,400
because that might be construed as
inflammatory.

477
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,650
Just like the example that you started
off the show,

478
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:30,700
you're hurting our sensibilities by
pushing your Judaism on us,

479
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:35,380
right?
So your your status did not always have

480
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:39,610
been threatened in that my head is going
to come off at any minute.

481
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:41,680
Right?
My parents grew up and lived there.

482
00:23:41,681 --> 00:23:45,560
They didn't die,
but once the civil war broke out,

483
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:48,230
then it became lethally dangerous to be
Jewish.

484
00:23:48,231 --> 00:23:52,310
I mean we were going to be executed.
We left so you never know when we're

485
00:23:52,311 --> 00:23:57,311
going to go from tolerating you to
offload the heads and that's been the

486
00:23:57,621 --> 00:24:01,070
history for the past 1400 years and so
again,

487
00:24:01,071 --> 00:24:03,620
when people think,
but Islam is not that bad.

488
00:24:03,621 --> 00:24:08,420
Look and under lucier a Jews and
Christians and Muslims use to walk

489
00:24:08,421 --> 00:24:11,840
around hand in hand and in Spain around
the 15th,

490
00:24:11,841 --> 00:24:14,780
16th century below me,
yes.

491
00:24:14,781 --> 00:24:18,380
People were not being beheaded everyday,
but you knew your place.

492
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:23,600
That's not equality and it's kind of
interesting when you talk about this

493
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:28,660
idea about how people are reluctant to
criticize Islam because they're worried

494
00:24:30,111 --> 00:24:35,111
about the repercussions of this.
It kind of speaks to how rare it is that

495
00:24:36,171 --> 00:24:41,171
people do violate those principles in
those countries because if you do have a

496
00:24:41,181 --> 00:24:46,181
culture that's 99 percent Islamic,
especially if they go by the book,

497
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:50,300
like every step of the way,
like there's not going to be a lot of

498
00:24:50,301 --> 00:24:54,770
people that are stepping on the line for
fear of the horrific repercussions.

499
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:59,660
Now psychologically in this country,
you're seeing that for some strange

500
00:24:59,661 --> 00:25:04,661
reason emerging from the left and
emerging from a lot of like really

501
00:25:04,701 --> 00:25:08,960
progressive colleges and universities
where they want to be almost the first

502
00:25:08,961 --> 00:25:13,961
ones to step up and say,
and don't criticize this one particular

503
00:25:14,601 --> 00:25:16,010
religion,
which is,

504
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:18,950
it's very odd because it's the most
regressive.

505
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:20,840
It's unbelievable.
It's very,

506
00:25:20,841 --> 00:25:25,580
it's a really strange position to be a
progressive who's reinforcing the

507
00:25:25,581 --> 00:25:30,581
ideologies of a regressive culture
that's very ancient.

508
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:34,550
But what's incredible is that they'll
come up with ways to defend this

509
00:25:34,551 --> 00:25:36,380
cognitive inconsistency.
And hence,

510
00:25:36,381 --> 00:25:38,750
that's part of the ostrich parasitic
syndrome that I was mentioning.

511
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:40,610
What,
what are some ways that they defend?

512
00:25:40,611 --> 00:25:42,170
So example.
Uh,

513
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:45,680
and it just gives you a few
manifestations of ostrich logic.

514
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:51,680
My friend Mohammed is a very nice guy
and he drinks and he fornicated and he's

515
00:25:51,681 --> 00:25:55,160
very liberal.
So the idea then becomes that as long as

516
00:25:55,161 --> 00:26:00,161
I can identify a single exemplar of a
Islamic person who does not otherwise,

517
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,790
uh,
adhere to what Islam dictates,

518
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:07,300
then it's not true that Islam is bad.
Now this is,

519
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:11,030
this is a manifestation of a more
general cognitive bias which goes like

520
00:26:11,031 --> 00:26:13,010
this.
If I walk into class and I say,

521
00:26:13,011 --> 00:26:16,550
look,
a homo sapiens are sexually dimorphic,

522
00:26:16,551 --> 00:26:18,950
they are an eight sex differences
between the two sexes.

523
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:22,250
Men are bigger than women.
Someone will put up their hand and say,

524
00:26:22,251 --> 00:26:24,590
but my aunt Linda is taller than my
uncle Joe.

525
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,390
Oh Gee.
Darwin is dead.

526
00:26:26,391 --> 00:26:27,260
Right?
So they,

527
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:32,370
they identify a singular exemplar that
is supposed to falsify a statement that

528
00:26:33,201 --> 00:26:35,570
is only true at the population level.
So here's.

529
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,780
So that's one example why Muhammad is
nice.

530
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:40,490
Therefore Islam is nice.
Here's a second example.

531
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,800
They point to a particular historical
context where Jews lived in Islamic

532
00:26:46,801 --> 00:26:48,690
countries and weren't killed,
Hae but God's side.

533
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:50,700
You lived in Lebanon and you still have
your head.

534
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:55,710
And the torque that I usually give as
well until they were going to cut off my

535
00:26:55,711 --> 00:26:57,090
head.
But secondly,

536
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,280
Jeffrey Dahmer,
if you take,

537
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:03,480
I think he,
he was guilty of 17 murders,

538
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,840
if you take the number of days that he
lived as an adult until he was caught as

539
00:27:09,781 --> 00:27:12,180
a percentage of the days that he killed
somebody.

540
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:14,850
90 nine point whatever percent of the
days.

541
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:18,630
Jeffrey Dahmer is a lovely guy.
So it's unfair for you to say that

542
00:27:18,631 --> 00:27:21,660
Jeffrey Dahmer is a mean guy given that
99 percent of the time,

543
00:27:21,661 --> 00:27:24,780
he's nice.
So what you have to basically do is take

544
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:29,580
each of these ostrich logic arguments
and analogize how the Arctic they are,

545
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:31,530
but it's very exhausting because the
bent,

546
00:27:31,531 --> 00:27:33,150
as you said,
of all these progressives,

547
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:37,230
is to do what ever they can to protect
the ideology.

548
00:27:37,231 --> 00:27:41,760
And so it becomes exhausting to
consistently have to try to fight

549
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:46,620
through all the clutter.
And it's not a thought that it's not

550
00:27:46,621 --> 00:27:50,280
something that is structured with
objective reasoning.

551
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,110
It's something that's structured with
their own particular ideology that does

552
00:27:55,111 --> 00:28:00,111
not want to criticize this one segment
of the human population that they think

553
00:28:00,151 --> 00:28:05,151
is being persecuted and meanwhile,
if you think about throughout currently

554
00:28:05,521 --> 00:28:09,720
in the world,
which ideology persecutes the most

555
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:11,100
number of other people.

556
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,560
So if you talk about bloody borders,
right?

557
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:17,790
Islam has fought with Buddhists,
Islam fights with animists,

558
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:21,030
Islam fights with Jews,
Islam fights with Christians.

559
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,370
Islam fights with the Beth and monks as
right,

560
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:27,390
so in other words,
Islam doesn't necessarily make for very

561
00:28:27,391 --> 00:28:28,800
good neighbors.
Why?

562
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:31,830
Because again,
not withstanding the fact that most

563
00:28:31,831 --> 00:28:36,120
Muslims are lovely and just want to
raise their kids Islam as a supremacist

564
00:28:36,121 --> 00:28:39,720
ideology,
it basically says that the world is

565
00:28:39,721 --> 00:28:42,390
meant to all be united under the flag
of.

566
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,760
Now.
Some people take that seriously.

567
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:47,580
Others don't,
but the doctrines of Islam are very

568
00:28:47,581 --> 00:28:50,640
clear.
We should all submit to Islam.

569
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:55,200
So even if 95 percent of Muslims don't
adhere to that tenant,

570
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:59,040
if only five percent do,
that means we're always going to have

571
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:02,220
friction.
In some cases it'll be like Lebanon.

572
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,500
By the way,
I've predicted that in Europe.

573
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,590
This is on record,
we can probably find that that in Europe

574
00:29:07,591 --> 00:29:08,870
within 15,
20,

575
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,080
25,
50 years,

576
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:13,530
we're going to have Lebanon all over the
place and now it's starting to happen.

577
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:15,780
Right?
At one point we were having daily

578
00:29:15,781 --> 00:29:18,420
attacks all over Europe,
so.

579
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,030
So again,
if you're going to increase Islamic

580
00:29:21,031 --> 00:29:25,050
immigration to the West,
of course most people are nice and just

581
00:29:25,051 --> 00:29:28,230
want to escape through a better world,
but are you willing to take the risks

582
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,070
for what's about to happen?
Are you willing to accept people whose

583
00:29:32,071 --> 00:29:35,970
cultural and religious values are
perfectly antithetical to yours?

584
00:29:35,971 --> 00:29:40,971
So example,
if you do pew surveys from around the

585
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:45,190
Middle East or Islamic countries about
your views on Jews while you'll get

586
00:29:45,191 --> 00:29:49,390
things like 95 to 99 percent Jew hatred.
So if I am,

587
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:51,520
if I am a Canadian Jew,
right,

588
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,760
and I see that 50,000 Syrians are going
to come in,

589
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,350
is it that I'm filled with hatred
towards Syrians or am I simply someone

590
00:29:59,351 --> 00:30:03,760
who calculates statistical regularities
and basically says that out of 50,000

591
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:07,180
people,
if 95 percent have academic Jew hatred

592
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:10,210
as part of their identity,
do I have a right to be concerned about

593
00:30:10,211 --> 00:30:10,570
this?

594
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:12,970
I'm not worried about Haitians.
They're black people.

595
00:30:12,971 --> 00:30:15,340
I'm not racist.
I'm not worried about the Vietnamese.

596
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,980
Right?
I'm worried about the cultural and

597
00:30:17,981 --> 00:30:21,810
religious baggage that you bring in.
What about your views towards cliteracy

598
00:30:21,811 --> 00:30:26,811
as or homosexuality or a religious
minorities or black dogs?

599
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,470
Darwin forbid,
if you're a black dog,

600
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:32,650
your dog,
Muhammad hated dogs,

601
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:35,940
but he particularly hated black dogs.
Uh,

602
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,240
so again,
so what do they do with blocked on the

603
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,710
go,
go online and you'll see some pretty

604
00:30:41,711 --> 00:30:42,570
ugly,
uh,

605
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:43,890
animal cruelty,
uh,

606
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:46,250
they're not very tolerant towards dogs.
Uh,

607
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,300
if you touch a dog before you're heading
to prayer,

608
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,940
this is called [inaudible].
It's in pure,

609
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,280
by the way,
the Kuffar,

610
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:56,630
the non Muslims are also nudges.
They're there.

611
00:30:56,670 --> 00:31:01,480
They're there as impure as urine and
blood and sperm and feces,

612
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:06,780
so should I feel bad that there is an
ideology that considers me an impure

613
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:09,310
quality?

614
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:11,380
Now,
does that mean that all Muslims are like

615
00:31:11,381 --> 00:31:12,310
that?
Of course not.

616
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:16,030
Ninety nine percent of the Muslims I've
met have been lovely and many of them

617
00:31:16,031 --> 00:31:18,700
are my friends,
but we should be able to talk about

618
00:31:18,701 --> 00:31:22,450
what's inside those books and those
books are not radical Islam.

619
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,830
They're Islam.
Well,

620
00:31:23,831 --> 00:31:26,380
let me ask you this.
What's the alternative like say for

621
00:31:26,381 --> 00:31:28,720
Syrian refugees,
I mean any kind,

622
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:33,721
caring person who has concern for our
fellow human beings sees these people

623
00:31:34,031 --> 00:31:36,520
fleeing and sees the horrific conditions
that they're.

624
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:40,870
That they're confronted with their own
country and they really don't have a lot

625
00:31:40,871 --> 00:31:43,270
of options and they're trying to escape
to the west.

626
00:31:43,271 --> 00:31:45,070
What?
What are the options?

627
00:31:45,071 --> 00:31:46,990
What do you do?
There are no clear answers.

628
00:31:46,991 --> 00:31:51,640
I would certainly say you first place
the people who are most at risk in those

629
00:31:51,641 --> 00:31:53,980
societies on the front of the queue.

630
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:57,070
So you bring the Yazidi women,
you'll bring the Christians who are

631
00:31:57,071 --> 00:31:59,740
being persecuted women.
But what about the father?

632
00:31:59,741 --> 00:32:02,410
If the dad is with the wife and the
children,

633
00:32:02,411 --> 00:32:06,120
you can't just have the father stayed
back behind the tent and you let the mom

634
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,910
go to Toronto with the kid.
No,

635
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:08,763
fair enough.
Uh,

636
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:12,760
what I was saying though is that let
people who are non Islamic who are

637
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:16,030
fleeing those areas at the front of the
queue first,

638
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:19,990
but isn't that,
isn't that religious persecution?

639
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,840
I mean,
or at the very least it's prejudice,

640
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:23,830
right?
I mean you're,

641
00:32:23,831 --> 00:32:26,470
you're,
you're singling people out because of

642
00:32:26,471 --> 00:32:28,960
their ideology or because of what
religion they're from,

643
00:32:28,961 --> 00:32:32,920
not because of their past behavior or
any predictors whatsoever about their

644
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,620
future behavior.
But we do have some statistical

645
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:40,250
irregularity about what types of values
those guys are going to come with.

646
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,260
So I'm not suggesting we closed the
door.

647
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,510
Wouldn't that in a way.
I mean,

648
00:32:44,511 --> 00:32:47,690
just to play devil's advocate,
wouldn't that in a way kind of put the

649
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:52,670
Muslims in Toronto who do immigrant,
which would have picked that city who

650
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:56,900
tried to immigrate to Canada in the same
sort of a position that your family was

651
00:32:56,901 --> 00:33:00,980
in in Lebanon where you were hiding the
fact that you would choose.

652
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:05,720
No one has an inalienable right to
immigrate anywhere.

653
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:09,230
Correct.
So if you wish to immigrate to the West

654
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:14,470
than leave every single syllable that
constitutes a belief attitude,

655
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:19,220
position,
value that is contrary to ours at the

656
00:33:19,221 --> 00:33:21,650
door and then welcome in my brother.
But man,

657
00:33:21,651 --> 00:33:25,190
isn't that a crazy thing to say to
someone whose entire life and their

658
00:33:25,191 --> 00:33:30,140
ideology is a big part of their identity
and who they are,

659
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:31,640
like how they view the world.

660
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:35,360
So that's the structure for which they
interface with other human beings.

661
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:39,980
But if those values.
So let's suppose that in a way I agree

662
00:33:39,981 --> 00:33:42,680
with you overall when I talk about the
entire human population,

663
00:33:42,681 --> 00:33:44,270
that it would be wonderful if we did
that,

664
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:48,260
but from individual to individual,
we know about the trials and

665
00:33:48,261 --> 00:33:52,190
tribulations that people go through.
On a day to day life and religious

666
00:33:52,191 --> 00:33:57,191
freedom and a religious ideology in many
cases helps people get through the pains

667
00:33:58,431 --> 00:34:00,890
of life.
It helps them get through the struggles.

668
00:34:00,891 --> 00:34:05,420
I'm not saying that it's rational,
but I am saying that in many ways it's a

669
00:34:05,421 --> 00:34:08,360
scaffolding for their own personal
behavior.

670
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:12,980
Got It.
You would have to then ensure that your

671
00:34:12,981 --> 00:34:17,981
religious practice is exclusively
practice privately.

672
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:22,730
Never should there ever be an intrusion
into the public sphere.

673
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:25,550
No.
Asking for prayer rooms at the

674
00:34:25,551 --> 00:34:28,910
university.
The example that you gave is the slight

675
00:34:28,911 --> 00:34:30,170
creeping she had.

676
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,250
Right?
It's the slow.

677
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:32,323
It's,
uh,

678
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:36,800
so my next book is called tentatively
might change death of the West by a

679
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,251
thousand cuts,
right?

680
00:34:37,251 --> 00:34:39,500
It's the idea that when you take,
again,

681
00:34:39,501 --> 00:34:42,650
the parable of the frog,
when you put it in boiling water and you

682
00:34:42,651 --> 00:34:44,000
do it very slowly,
the frog,

683
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:45,290
if you do it very,
very slowly,

684
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:47,360
if it falls below a just noticeable
difference,

685
00:34:47,361 --> 00:34:51,110
it doesn't notice that the temperature
is rising until it's too late and it

686
00:34:51,111 --> 00:34:51,950
boils to death.
Right?

687
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:55,250
So this idea of just noticeable
difference is something that's very

688
00:34:55,251 --> 00:34:58,880
important in this conversation.
We're not going to get Islam analyzed

689
00:34:58,881 --> 00:35:02,540
overnight,
but Egypt before it became Islamic,

690
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:04,640
used to be non Islamic.
Once upon a time.

691
00:35:04,641 --> 00:35:07,250
Today it's about 10 percent.
The Coptic Christians,

692
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:10,760
Turkey is now 99 percent Islamic.
One day.

693
00:35:10,761 --> 00:35:13,960
It wasn't Iran.
The Great Persian empires were not

694
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:16,190
Islamic today.
It's almost exclusively Islamic.

695
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:19,220
So the United States and Canada are not
going to become,

696
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,720
uh,
Islamic,

697
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:21,441
uh,
you know,

698
00:35:21,441 --> 00:35:24,380
in the next 10 years.
But give it enough time,

699
00:35:24,381 --> 00:35:29,381
have a long enough view of history and I
worry about your grandchildren and mine.

700
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,280
Uh,
and so we,

701
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:34,250
that's how you have an honest
conversation.

702
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,890
And I'm not sure what the answer is.
One possibility which I've with folks on

703
00:35:37,891 --> 00:35:38,010
my

704
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:43,010
show who are trained lawyers,
is that there are provisions in the law,

705
00:35:44,101 --> 00:35:47,280
at least in the United States,
to the Claire and ideology as being

706
00:35:47,281 --> 00:35:48,420
suspicious,
right?

707
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:53,460
So in the same way that you could say
that Nazi-ism is seditious to our values

708
00:35:53,461 --> 00:35:56,700
or communism,
they are elements of Islam.

709
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:01,770
The nonspiritual parts that it doesn't
take Einstein to recognize that they are

710
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,240
perfectly antithetical to every single
value that you and I with the whole deer

711
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:09,030
as Westerners.
So like what?

712
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,700
What would be some of those volumes?
So take for example,

713
00:36:11,701 --> 00:36:12,480
Shetty,
aloe,

714
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,540
right,
which is the Islamic law by which you

715
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:20,541
organize society.
The first premise of Islamic law is that

716
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:25,790
the a crime,
its severity and its punishment depends

717
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:29,850
on the identity of the perpetrator and
the victim.

718
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:33,420
So imagine the idea and the American
constitution that justice is blind.

719
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,850
Well,
that is already violated as the most

720
00:36:35,851 --> 00:36:37,320
fundamental tenets of Sharia law.

721
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,050
If a Muslim kills a Jew,
it's very,

722
00:36:40,051 --> 00:36:43,380
very different crime than if a Jew kills
a Muslim.

723
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,230
You can just go,
go look up reliance of the traveler,

724
00:36:46,231 --> 00:36:49,640
which is the English translation of
shadow law.

725
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:53,670
And you'll see all these things.
So why should we tolerate this kind of

726
00:36:53,671 --> 00:36:54,580
stuff?
Right?

727
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:59,070
Come in my Muslim brothers,
but keep the stuff that you yourself

728
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,860
escaped from out of our country.
We don't want it.

729
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,700
And if you keep it out,
come in and let's grow together and hug

730
00:37:05,701 --> 00:37:08,310
it out.
But why should I be tolerant towards the

731
00:37:08,311 --> 00:37:09,730
intolerable?
I,

732
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:13,390
I agree with you in theory,
but I think the problem is as soon as

733
00:37:13,391 --> 00:37:17,200
you tell someone to not follow certain
aspects of their ideology,

734
00:37:17,201 --> 00:37:20,680
those aspects become even more
attractive and especially if they

735
00:37:20,681 --> 00:37:25,270
consider the west to be decadent and
filled with sin and fornicating and

736
00:37:25,271 --> 00:37:28,240
drinking and all the,
all the things that they think are

737
00:37:28,241 --> 00:37:31,450
disgusting.
And then these people are the ones who

738
00:37:31,451 --> 00:37:35,950
are telling you that you can't follow
the word of God has brought down by the

739
00:37:35,951 --> 00:37:40,840
profit from up on high.
It becomes even more attractive to them.

740
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,930
So what do we do?
So what's your truck's psychedelic

741
00:37:43,931 --> 00:37:46,330
drugs?
Everyone gets on mushrooms and I'm not

742
00:37:46,331 --> 00:37:48,310
kidding.
I really.

743
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:52,960
I really think you need transcendent
experiences to escape from the day to

744
00:37:52,961 --> 00:37:57,760
day vibration of normal life.
How about just the commitment to reason

745
00:37:57,761 --> 00:37:59,800
and science?
It would be wonderful if we could do

746
00:37:59,801 --> 00:38:02,380
that,
but people are so terrified of death and

747
00:38:02,381 --> 00:38:06,580
they're so terrified of the unknown and
they're so terrified of not having

748
00:38:06,581 --> 00:38:10,510
structure.
People love having ideological structure

749
00:38:10,511 --> 00:38:13,210
that they can govern their life by real
clear,

750
00:38:13,211 --> 00:38:14,680
established rules.
Man.

751
00:38:14,681 --> 00:38:17,890
People get mad at me when I wear a fanny
pack and I'm not joking.

752
00:38:17,891 --> 00:38:21,550
One of the reasons why where it is
because people think it's disgusting.

753
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:25,180
Like you think it's disgusting that I
will have a bag around my waist that I

754
00:38:25,181 --> 00:38:26,910
can keep my keys and phone in.
It's,

755
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:29,350
but we have structure.
You know,

756
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:32,350
men aren't supposed to wear sandals.
You know,

757
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:35,140
if you're a man and you're wearing high
heels open toed,

758
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:36,130
you will get

759
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:37,060
ridiculed.
Why?

760
00:38:37,061 --> 00:38:39,130
Because we have a structure and this
structure,

761
00:38:39,131 --> 00:38:39,551
we don't.
I mean,

762
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:42,880
that's a bad example,
but it's not really because it's along

763
00:38:42,881 --> 00:38:47,881
the same lines of thinking that we would
expect you to behave like we do so that

764
00:38:48,431 --> 00:38:50,530
we don't have to worry about your
behavior.

765
00:38:50,531 --> 00:38:53,650
I like gentlemen,
I like a man with a tie and a suit

766
00:38:53,651 --> 00:38:57,610
because I'm pretty sure that guy's not
going to spit at me and stab me and rob

767
00:38:57,611 --> 00:39:00,220
me.
We have these ideas about people that

768
00:39:00,221 --> 00:39:02,860
dress and behave a certain way.
You know,

769
00:39:02,861 --> 00:39:04,930
if someone,
if you're in a business meeting and the

770
00:39:04,931 --> 00:39:07,000
guy starts swearing,
he'll like,

771
00:39:07,001 --> 00:39:08,650
Whoa,
I all bets are off.

772
00:39:08,651 --> 00:39:11,110
This man's not establishing the
gentleman's protocol.

773
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:15,340
He's not following the standard business
oriented,

774
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:18,220
you know,
I would just like to exchange numbers

775
00:39:18,221 --> 00:39:21,850
and funds with you protocol,
and so I don't understand what his

776
00:39:21,851 --> 00:39:22,690
behavior is going to be.

777
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,690
He's unpredictable.
He could be a random street thug with a

778
00:39:25,691 --> 00:39:26,530
hoodie.
You know,

779
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:29,530
that was a thing for awhile.
People were scared of young black men

780
00:39:29,531 --> 00:39:32,830
with hoodies on because a gentleman
would not wear a hoodie on the street.

781
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:34,720
That's a dangerous person.
By the way.

782
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:37,510
Our brains have evolved to think this
way.

783
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,220
Right?
And so this idea,

784
00:39:39,221 --> 00:39:42,500
you were asking me earlier,
give me some examples of ostrich logic.

785
00:39:42,501 --> 00:39:46,660
So this kind of Hashtag not all right
now.

786
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:48,310
That again is idiotic.
Why?

787
00:39:48,311 --> 00:39:51,310
Because when we think about it,
let's not talk about Islam for a second.

788
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:55,510
If you're going down a dark alley and
you see for young men,

789
00:39:55,511 --> 00:39:58,840
forget about hoodies and pants down just
for young men.

790
00:39:58,841 --> 00:40:02,410
So all you have described is the fact
that they're young and they're men.

791
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,800
If you see for young men versus four
elderly women just because of your

792
00:40:08,051 --> 00:40:10,180
statistical regularity that you
calculate,

793
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:14,470
which is more which group is more likely
to end violence on you,

794
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,680
then you might avoid the alley with the
four young men,

795
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:20,080
even though not all young men,
right?

796
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:24,520
Even though the probability that a young
man is going to jump you and gang rape

797
00:40:24,521 --> 00:40:27,040
you and Mug you and stab you as a small
one,

798
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:31,000
but your brain has evolved to calculate
those statistical regularities and to

799
00:40:31,001 --> 00:40:35,500
then be very careful,
be very risk averse and putting yourself

800
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,840
in harm's way.
So again,

801
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:41,170
even though most Muslims are very nice
and very lovely,

802
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:45,670
I think we have enough data right now.
If we look at the last since 2000,

803
00:40:45,671 --> 00:40:47,500
11,
2000,

804
00:40:47,501 --> 00:40:51,460
one nine slash 11,
there's been over 30,000 terror attacks

805
00:40:51,461 --> 00:40:53,140
committed in the name of Islam,
right?

806
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:58,240
I challenge anybody in your comments
section to list me another ideology that

807
00:40:58,241 --> 00:41:01,180
comes remotely close.
If you added up every single other

808
00:41:01,181 --> 00:41:05,020
ideology since 2001,
you wouldn't come up to 100.

809
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:09,820
So what is the statistical numbers that
you need to see before you're able to

810
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:11,080
simply say,
look,

811
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:12,550
let's have an honest conversation.

812
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:15,610
Not withstanding that,
not all Muslims and most are nice.

813
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:17,710
Is there a problem with Islam?
Yes.

814
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:20,140
It's not radical Islam.
It's not Islam Islam.

815
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:25,410
It's not militant violent extremism.
Let's stop with the bullshit euphemisms.

816
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:29,980
There are inherent elements,
contents within Islam that are

817
00:41:29,981 --> 00:41:32,950
problematic.
It's not my job to find a way to get rid

818
00:41:32,951 --> 00:41:34,880
of them,
but if you wish to be part of our

819
00:41:34,881 --> 00:41:37,970
western societies,
then you need to find the way to expunge

820
00:41:37,971 --> 00:41:39,470
that stuff.
If you do it,

821
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:41,480
welcome my brother.
We're all brothers.

822
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:44,630
If you don't,
then I should show preference to people

823
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,800
who share similar cultural values.
To me that's.

824
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:51,920
That's called survival instinct.
Now what about people that would say

825
00:41:51,921 --> 00:41:54,410
that there's inherent problems with the
Jewish religion?

826
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:58,220
There's inherent problems with
subscribing to that ideology that there

827
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:03,080
had been persecuting Islamic people in
Palestine that they've been prosecuting

828
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:07,760
and treating Islamic people as inferior
to Jewish people.

829
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,730
That's not me.
I know you're not necessarily saying it,

830
00:42:10,731 --> 00:42:14,570
but that's all part of ostrich logic.
That's what I call the Crusades.

831
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:16,130
Right.
And it's not me who actually came up

832
00:42:16,131 --> 00:42:17,420
with the.
Right.

833
00:42:17,421 --> 00:42:20,240
So every time we did,
but more like,

834
00:42:20,241 --> 00:42:21,074
it's,
it's a,

835
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,430
it's,
it's a way of saying like,

836
00:42:22,431 --> 00:42:24,860
but bro,
but what about the Crusades,

837
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,010
Amal?
Huh?

838
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:29,690
Where's that from?
I think I first saw it and he'll be

839
00:42:29,691 --> 00:42:34,010
happy that I'm giving a shadow.
I think a guy on youtube who goes by the

840
00:42:34,011 --> 00:42:37,730
name of t and crowds or Kraut and t,
he's a German youtuber.

841
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:38,990
Oh,
I'm sorry.

842
00:42:38,991 --> 00:42:41,750
I meant like,
that's not from a language or anything.

843
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:42,021
Oh No,
no,

844
00:42:42,021 --> 00:42:42,231
no,
no.

845
00:42:42,231 --> 00:42:43,310
It's,
it's like saying,

846
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:44,420
Bro,
let's Duh,

847
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:44,991
Duh.
Exactly.

848
00:42:44,991 --> 00:42:46,010
Okay.
Wait a minute.

849
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:48,190
Exactly.
But the Crusades,

850
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:50,070
as soon as you,
as,

851
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:54,770
as soon as you point to some Islamic
ugly reality than someone points,

852
00:42:54,771 --> 00:42:56,970
but bro,
what about Israel but isn't ended up

853
00:42:56,971 --> 00:42:57,980
valid comparison?

854
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:00,210
I mean really,
but you're kind of claiming and

855
00:43:00,211 --> 00:43:01,290
ideology,
right?

856
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:02,091
Right.
I mean,

857
00:43:02,091 --> 00:43:05,780
but when you're saying you're Jewish and
I support you saying this 100 percent,

858
00:43:05,781 --> 00:43:10,700
especially considering of all people,
you should be in some ways proud of who

859
00:43:10,701 --> 00:43:14,810
you are considering that you come from a
line of oppressed people that escaped a

860
00:43:14,811 --> 00:43:18,950
horrible situation.
A no one is arguing that there is a

861
00:43:18,951 --> 00:43:22,550
monopoly of ugliness that only stems
from Islam.

862
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,220
Jews can engage in ugliness,
Christians,

863
00:43:25,221 --> 00:43:29,720
atheists.
Why subscribed to any ideology then?

864
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:33,200
Because in the case of a,
you're talking about specifically

865
00:43:33,201 --> 00:43:34,100
Israel,
any,

866
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:35,590
any ideology,
any.

867
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:38,660
Not necessarily Israel,
which is a land,

868
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:42,500
but I reject all the religious elements
of Judaism,

869
00:43:42,501 --> 00:43:44,010
so,
so why are you a Jew?

870
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:46,910
Because I am part of A.
People are part of a shared history,

871
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:48,930
so it's like I'm Italian,
your attack kind of thing.

872
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:49,910
You're a time,
right?

873
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,700
I,
I belong to the lineage.

874
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,200
And the same way,
by the way,

875
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:59,210
I recently put up a clip on my channel
where I talked about academic lineage.

876
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:03,990
So in the same way that you could build
a genealogy of your family tree or of a

877
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:06,320
people's,
you could do what's called an academic

878
00:44:06,321 --> 00:44:07,670
genealogy.
So for example,

879
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:12,880
my doctoral supervisor is my academic
father and then I could look to see who

880
00:44:12,951 --> 00:44:16,820
was his academic supervisor and who was
his academic supervisor and do the

881
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,240
martial arts.
Is that right?

882
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:19,580
Yeah,
there's a direct lineage.

883
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:23,900
So I could literally go back to some of
the founders and only three or four

884
00:44:23,901 --> 00:44:25,160
generations,
um,

885
00:44:25,161 --> 00:44:27,530
with some of the pioneers of,
of psychology.

886
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:30,650
And so I belong to that particular
tribe,

887
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:33,000
right?
It comes to academia when it comes to my

888
00:44:33,001 --> 00:44:35,100
ethnicity,
to my religious heritage.

889
00:44:35,101 --> 00:44:36,630
I belong to a group called Jews.

890
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:40,710
Now that doesn't mean that all the Booga
Booga bullshit in Judaism I buy into,

891
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:44,190
I rejected.
So it makes me already somewhat less

892
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:48,420
dangerous.
And that if there are any ugly elements

893
00:44:48,421 --> 00:44:50,280
within Judaism,
they're simply not going to be

894
00:44:50,281 --> 00:44:52,920
instantiated because I'm openly
rejecting all that shit.

895
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,130
Right?
I understand that you as an individual

896
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:58,560
or me as an individual and most Jews in
the west,

897
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:01,650
I think would fit into my category by
the way,

898
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:05,610
later we should talk about four and a
half hour talk I had with a Hasid,

899
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:09,960
a very religious Jew.
Let's do it flying ticket to California

900
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:12,000
on a second.
Now,

901
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:14,430
if most Muslims said,
look,

902
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:18,840
there's tons of historical elements in
Islamic societies that's beautiful.

903
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:21,480
Islamic architecture,
Islamic Science,

904
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,070
Islamic,
Islamic Science,

905
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:25,390
some Islamic philosophy,
uh,

906
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:29,160
one of the first intellectuals and in
modern history,

907
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:32,760
big history,
so so I could be Muslim and that I come

908
00:45:32,761 --> 00:45:36,060
from a shared lineage of people and I
could be very proud of that,

909
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:41,280
but I can also have the moral compass
and the moral fortitude to say,

910
00:45:41,281 --> 00:45:45,480
but there is stuff in my book that is
truly grotesque and no amount of

911
00:45:45,481 --> 00:45:50,481
obfuscation and re interpretive dancing
could alter that ugliness,

912
00:45:50,911 --> 00:45:51,090
right?

913
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:52,590
There's no way to take kill,
kill,

914
00:45:52,591 --> 00:45:53,101
kill,
kill,

915
00:45:53,101 --> 00:45:54,810
kill,
taken a suppressor outbreak,

916
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:58,080
resume killing.
There is no way to take that and

917
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:02,190
reinterpreted using modern sensibilities
to mean at killing with caresses,

918
00:46:02,191 --> 00:46:04,020
right?
Let's not play this reform game,

919
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:09,230
so be proud of your cultural identity if
and if that incorporates an Islamic

920
00:46:10,921 --> 00:46:13,650
identity grade,
but reject all the bullshit.

921
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:17,190
Right?
And so I think that's where Judaism and

922
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:20,370
Christianity at this point is somewhat
different from Islam.

923
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:24,750
For most people who are Islamic,
even if they don't necessarily believe

924
00:46:24,751 --> 00:46:28,230
it,
they'll feel very reticent to openly

925
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:32,520
admitted that they despise a lot of the
ugliness they'll say it's not true.

926
00:46:32,521 --> 00:46:34,530
It doesn't exist.
You didn't understand that.

927
00:46:34,531 --> 00:46:36,960
You misinterpreted that Reza Aslan
Bullshit,

928
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:38,190
right?
No,

929
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:40,230
be honest about it.
Say it exists.

930
00:46:40,231 --> 00:46:42,720
Say you're rejected and let's move
forward,

931
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:46,110
but stop skating.
Well then there's people like Majid

932
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:49,890
Nawaz who has,
he identifies as being a Muslim,

933
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:53,190
but he does reject those things,
but he says that you could reform them

934
00:46:53,191 --> 00:46:56,160
and measured,
and I have had in case some of you

935
00:46:56,161 --> 00:46:57,090
viewers don't know this.

936
00:46:57,330 --> 00:47:01,200
Uh,
I invited at one point two four to chat

937
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,940
and uh,
uh,

938
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:06,460
he refused because I think he refused
and I,

939
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:11,510
I can't put intent into his mind,
but I'm analyzing his rejection to chat

940
00:47:12,391 --> 00:47:15,480
with me.
I think it's because he sees that I'm

941
00:47:15,481 --> 00:47:17,460
going to call them out on a lot of his
narrative.

942
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:20,370
Well,
no one knows why someone rejects.

943
00:47:20,371 --> 00:47:21,990
I'm sure.
Did he openly rejected?

944
00:47:21,991 --> 00:47:23,940
Like he has no room for it in the
future,

945
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:24,760
whoever.
Yeah,

946
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,790
I mean,
at this point I retract that invitation.

947
00:47:26,791 --> 00:47:30,250
So even if you want it to run,
there's an expression in Arabic.

948
00:47:30,251 --> 00:47:34,000
I'm going to use this for a second.
Imagine this is the pen.

949
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:34,930
He's holding a pen.
A.

950
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:37,060
Oh,
I'm holding the people at home

951
00:47:37,061 --> 00:47:40,060
listening.
The vast majority of guys listening.

952
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:41,440
Imagine that.
This spend,

953
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:44,170
we're a cork.
The cork of a wine bottle.

954
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:46,960
There's an expression in Arabic,
which I'll say in Arabic.

955
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,610
Some people have heard,
mentioned before.

956
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:53,940
The expression is this guy to bill's bb.
Discardable is bb is to get drunk simply

957
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:56,250
by smelling the court.
Right?

958
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,690
So I look,
I'm smelling it.

959
00:47:58,691 --> 00:48:01,030
I'm already getting drunk.
That's what measured in there was his,

960
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:01,990
he,
he,

961
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:05,380
he gets people drunk with his,
uh,

962
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:08,890
hopeful reform message.
Sounds so liberal.

963
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:12,910
That sounds so hopeful.
Say the expression of this scheduled

964
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:13,763
bills,
baby.

965
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:18,840
I can't even make that noise in my face,
but that this schedule booths but like,

966
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:21,710
but like Yanni.
Oh,

967
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:22,563
there you go.
Now,

968
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:27,160
do you want me to have the rest of this
conversation in Arabic be fascinating.

969
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,320
I wish I could speak.
It sounds cool.

970
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:31,630
Actually.
What happens with a lot of the guests

971
00:48:31,631 --> 00:48:34,060
that I bring in on my show who are
Arabic,

972
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:39,300
we always start off the star of our show
speaking only in Arabic because for most

973
00:48:39,611 --> 00:48:41,590
westerners it's fetishize.

974
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:42,710
It's so excited.
Like,

975
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:45,540
oh my goodness,
that's so alien to the way you speak

976
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:47,900
English.
The sounds right,

977
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:51,820
but so going back to magic,
I think what maybe his heart is in the

978
00:48:51,821 --> 00:48:52,750
right place.
I don't.

979
00:48:52,751 --> 00:48:57,130
I'm not.
I'm not trying to infer or imply that

980
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:01,210
he's diabolical are duplicitous.
I think he probably truly believes that

981
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:06,840
he's doing something worthwhile.
The problem is that it's not as though

982
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:09,220
until measured.
The West came along.

983
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:13,060
No one had ever thought about this idea
of reforming Islam.

984
00:49:13,061 --> 00:49:15,220
Jesus really?
We never thought of that in the last

985
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:18,160
1400 years,
but the reality is that there are

986
00:49:18,161 --> 00:49:21,850
elements within the doctrines of Islam
that simply don't permit for this

987
00:49:21,851 --> 00:49:24,760
reformation to take place and even if it
could take place,

988
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:29,440
we don't necessarily have the time to
wait another 400 years while we

989
00:49:29,441 --> 00:49:33,850
deliberate how each syllable and each of
the problematic passages should be

990
00:49:33,851 --> 00:49:38,500
reinterpreted while people spot are
being stacked up all over the world and

991
00:49:38,501 --> 00:49:42,880
so therefore I think that there needs to
be a much more direct intervention and

992
00:49:42,881 --> 00:49:45,490
what I mean by direct intervention,
no,

993
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:48,460
there doesn't need to be reformed,
doesn't need to be interpreted.

994
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:51,700
It needs to be expunged.
These types of ideas.

995
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:56,910
If Judaism has certain ideas that are a
belligerent to women's cliteracy,

996
00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:02,550
then I want those ideas and Judaism out.
They don't belong in the public arena of

997
00:50:03,371 --> 00:50:04,630
ideas.
That's it.

998
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,620
Now,
how did Christianity reform and Islam

999
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:10,960
did not?
How did that go about happening?

1000
00:50:10,961 --> 00:50:12,880
Because at one point in time,
Christianity,

1001
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Christianity was a very repressive
religion and the apostasy,

1002
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,000
the idea of it was much more oppressed
than today.

1003
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:25,210
Right now,
like Islam is the only religion that I'm

1004
00:50:25,211 --> 00:50:25,991
aware of.
I mean,

1005
00:50:25,991 --> 00:50:29,150
maybe there's more that I'm just
ignorant to where if you leave the

1006
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:32,060
religion they can kill you.
Absolutely.

1007
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:33,330
I mean,
that's like,

1008
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:36,830
that's what God wants.
God wants you to die because you don't

1009
00:50:36,831 --> 00:50:38,240
believe in them anymore.
What?

1010
00:50:38,241 --> 00:50:41,810
I've always said that Islam is the
perfect meme of plex.

1011
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:43,640
So are you familiar with that term
means?

1012
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:47,480
No.
So a meme is a term that Richard Dawkins

1013
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:50,280
coined in his book in 1976.
Selfish,

1014
00:50:50,290 --> 00:50:51,230
selfish gene.
Thank you.

1015
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:55,160
Uh,
where he was analogizing the idea of a

1016
00:50:55,161 --> 00:50:57,620
gene.
Gene's propagate,

1017
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,700
correct?
Well,

1018
00:50:58,701 --> 00:51:03,560
memes are packets of information that
spread from one brain to another.

1019
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:07,490
And so means also spread.
We are both a biological and a cultural

1020
00:51:07,491 --> 00:51:08,324
animal,
right?

1021
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:10,610
Both are gene spread and our ideas
spread.

1022
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:14,840
So a meme is something that can go.
So if you read my books,

1023
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:18,980
I am infecting your brain with my memes,
with my ideas.

1024
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:21,410
Correct.
A library is a collection of memes.

1025
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:22,700
So.
And Mima.

1026
00:51:22,701 --> 00:51:27,620
Plex is a collection of means that in
this case falls under a religious idea.

1027
00:51:27,621 --> 00:51:28,710
Ideology.
Well,

1028
00:51:28,711 --> 00:51:31,760
Islam is the perfect Mimo plex in what
sense?

1029
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:36,170
And that it's contents are made to
spread.

1030
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,550
For example,
Judaism.

1031
00:51:37,551 --> 00:51:39,740
You mentioned earlier Judaism,
you don't have any Jews there are in the

1032
00:51:39,741 --> 00:51:40,574
world.

1033
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:43,150
John spot 12.
What?

1034
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:43,910
No,
I don't know.

1035
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:46,880
I'm still going to ask you what you want
to just not to put you on the spot.

1036
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:48,770
How many,
how many?

1037
00:51:48,771 --> 00:51:52,670
Seven billion people in the world?
I would guess there would be somewhere

1038
00:51:52,671 --> 00:51:56,180
in the neighborhood of a billion Jews.
A billion.

1039
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:56,811
Uh,
Jamie,

1040
00:51:56,811 --> 00:51:59,030
you want to take $500?
Million maybe.

1041
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:01,520
I'm going to get.
I'm going to take a very conservative

1042
00:52:01,521 --> 00:52:01,950
guests.
I'm gonna.

1043
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:04,940
Change it to 500 million.
I'm so glad that we did this.

1044
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,050
You're going to be shocked how many
there is somewhere between 13 to 15

1045
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:11,090
million Jews.
That is more than that in New York.

1046
00:52:11,091 --> 00:52:13,310
Now you're out of your fucking mind.
I'll just look it up.

1047
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:15,410
Shut the off.
Skype talking crazy.

1048
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:17,090
He's an agent.
Let let,

1049
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:18,530
let.
I'm a Zionist shell.

1050
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:19,940
Let,
let,

1051
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:22,340
let Jamie now do his little google
magic.

1052
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,750
Thirteen to $15.
Million.

1053
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:24,980
$50.
Million.

1054
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:28,280
There's more idiots in America than
there are Jews and that's only an

1055
00:52:28,281 --> 00:52:30,620
Arkansas.
I'm sorry guys.

1056
00:52:30,621 --> 00:52:33,250
I'm just going.
Is that really it?

1057
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,800
Well,
think about how many Nobel Prize winners

1058
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:40,250
are Jews and 25 to 30 percent.
It's incredible,

1059
00:52:40,251 --> 00:52:41,330
right?
And that,

1060
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:42,283
that,
by the way,

1061
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,390
some people will say there is a genetic
element,

1062
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,330
but even if here we go,
what do we got?

1063
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:48,940
Fourteen dollars million.
200,000.

1064
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:53,750
Between 30 and $50 million.
That's perfectly accurate.

1065
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:55,340
What is the enlarged?
What does that mean?

1066
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:58,430
The world most?
The most.

1067
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:00,680
The largest number of possibles.
20 million.

1068
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:03,620
You know that's like given I've never
seen 20 million.

1069
00:53:03,621 --> 00:53:05,420
It's usually the highest I've seen is 16
million.

1070
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:08,270
It says core Jewish and and large
Jewish.

1071
00:53:08,271 --> 00:53:11,870
What does that like dudes will get
converted because their wife makes him.

1072
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:13,740
I don't know,
my uncle did that,

1073
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:15,283
but by,
by,

1074
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:17,360
by strict,
by strictly conversion allows that would

1075
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:20,180
not be allowed and not allowed to
convert for ulterior motives.

1076
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:21,410
What?
Alternative motives?

1077
00:53:21,411 --> 00:53:24,770
He wants to be spiritual.
It's a spiritual awakening.

1078
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:26,280
Well,
went through the whole process.

1079
00:53:26,281 --> 00:53:29,460
He went to Hebrew school.
The whole process has to be for no

1080
00:53:29,461 --> 00:53:32,670
ulterior motive.
It can't be because my wife would not

1081
00:53:32,671 --> 00:53:35,810
marry me otherwise,
but I think he did it because she wanted

1082
00:53:35,811 --> 00:53:38,640
him to do and then he decided to do it
because it was what,

1083
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:39,810
you know.
I mean,

1084
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:41,830
I get it.
But anyway,

1085
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:42,970
let's go back.
So there are,

1086
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:48,140
there are about 13 to 15 million Jews.
There are one point 6 billion Muslims,

1087
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:54,810
one fifth of humanity to every one Jew,
there's 100 Muslim.

1088
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:59,310
Which ideology is more successful based
on propagation,

1089
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:00,540
Islam,
or Judaism.

1090
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:02,730
Right.
Now,

1091
00:54:02,731 --> 00:54:03,720
why is that?
Well,

1092
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:06,610
take for example,
conversion laws for,

1093
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:08,250
as you said about.
Was it your cousin?

1094
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:09,190
No,
my uncle,

1095
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:10,760
my uncle.
Uh,

1096
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:13,080
in the way that he did it,
as you said,

1097
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:16,110
it's a very assiduous process.

1098
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:18,960
It takes a long time before and as a
matter of fact,

1099
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:23,160
the rabbis are supposed to try to
dissuade you from converting to Judaism

1100
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:26,790
because that in a sense tests your
faith,

1101
00:54:26,791 --> 00:54:30,420
your desire to change an Islam.
Do you know what you have to do to

1102
00:54:30,421 --> 00:54:31,320
convert?
What?

1103
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:34,590
I won't say it because if I actually say
it in Arabic,

1104
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:37,860
that converted converted and therefore
if I leave it,

1105
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,350
but basically you just have to say the
Shahada,

1106
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,480
which it's like the.
I testify,

1107
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:46,230
wow.
It's a once one sentence and then that's

1108
00:54:46,231 --> 00:54:47,240
it.
Boom ran.

1109
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,010
If you leave your dead in Judaism,
there isn't that.

1110
00:54:50,670 --> 00:54:52,920
How about laws?
Laws for marriage.

1111
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:57,750
A Muslim man can marry up to four women
including non Muslim women and convert

1112
00:54:57,751 --> 00:55:00,210
them,
but a Muslim woman cannot do the other

1113
00:55:00,211 --> 00:55:04,020
way around,
so the whole structure of Islam is built

1114
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:08,640
on the propagation of the belief system,
so just by that,

1115
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:10,500
which one is going to be more dangerous?

1116
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:14,900
One is a proselytizing religion.
The other one you're not allowed to in

1117
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:18,720
Judaism to proselytize,
you're not supposed to try to convert

1118
00:55:18,721 --> 00:55:23,721
others and Islam is to proselytize.
You have to now in different countries,

1119
00:55:25,711 --> 00:55:28,110
they'll do it in different ways.
In the West where they are in the

1120
00:55:28,111 --> 00:55:31,260
minority,
they'll do it through interfaith

1121
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:34,560
exchanges,
but the interfaith exchanges are always

1122
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:39,240
the Muslim telling the non Muslim how
great our religion is and why you should

1123
00:55:39,241 --> 00:55:39,990
convert.
It's never.

1124
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:41,730
It's never given.
Take a.

1125
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:44,820
So just going back to your early point
about Israel and so on.

1126
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:45,871
Yes,
of course.

1127
00:55:45,871 --> 00:55:50,730
Undoubtedly there are some Israelis that
do very bad things to their non Jewish

1128
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:52,380
brothers.
No question.

1129
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:56,790
But when we're talking about existential
threats to our western ways,

1130
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:00,450
you and I probably don't stay up
worrying about radical Jews.

1131
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:01,960
No,
no,

1132
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:03,120
don't.
Um,

1133
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:08,390
I wonder what it is about people that
makes us so susceptible to ideological

1134
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:14,241
thinking and still,
and whether or not it's ever expungeable

1135
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:16,620
you know,
whether or not it's ever something that

1136
00:56:16,621 --> 00:56:19,050
we can eradicate from the thought
process.

1137
00:56:19,051 --> 00:56:21,810
It just seems inherent to being a
person.

1138
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,830
So much so that I recognize it in
myself.

1139
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:25,900
Like,
here's a perfect example.

1140
00:56:25,901 --> 00:56:29,270
I ran into a guy just a few days ago and
he was,

1141
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:31,960
he said hello to me.
And then he explained to me that he

1142
00:56:31,961 --> 00:56:36,310
trains Jujitsu with the Machados and
immediately we were like brothers

1143
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,230
because that's my lineage,
right?

1144
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:40,540
So it's like,
oh,

1145
00:56:40,541 --> 00:56:42,580
what's up man?
Like immediately.

1146
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,560
And I'm like,
that is so weird.

1147
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:46,120
It's so weird.
You know,

1148
00:56:46,121 --> 00:56:49,360
like I,
I understand like when I talk to someone

1149
00:56:49,361 --> 00:56:51,190
like how long you train?
Twelve years.

1150
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:51,971
Oh,
okay.

1151
00:56:51,971 --> 00:56:54,280
So you understand me and I understand
you.

1152
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:55,090
Uh,
where do you,

1153
00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:58,030
where do you train Machado's Oh,
we come from the same thing.

1154
00:56:58,210 --> 00:56:58,951
Oh,
we're like,

1155
00:56:58,951 --> 00:57:00,760
Bro,
this is a weird thing.

1156
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:02,680
Like I'd give that guy a ride.
I don't even know him.

1157
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:04,300
You know what I mean?
But that's,

1158
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:07,660
that's the case with religion.
That's the case with,

1159
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:11,110
with many things.
It's the case with ethnic ethnicities.

1160
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:16,320
Oftentimes with even with state pride,
like we branch off into groups and we

1161
00:57:17,771 --> 00:57:22,420
have micro groups and macro groups and
it gets real weird when we do this,

1162
00:57:22,421 --> 00:57:23,260
but we all do it.

1163
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:28,580
So to speak exactly about this ever
granular way to compare it to

1164
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:33,000
compartmentalize us versus them.
Let me mention the Hasidic.

1165
00:57:33,570 --> 00:57:34,440
Oh yeah,
please do.

1166
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:39,030
Because the reason I,
the reason that's a good segue is

1167
00:57:39,031 --> 00:57:41,580
because I actually raised it with him on
the plane.

1168
00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:45,930
I used to live in an area in Montreal
called Mall for the Montreal is out

1169
00:57:45,931 --> 00:57:46,711
there.
They'll know where it is,

1170
00:57:46,711 --> 00:57:51,711
where there are a lot of acidic Jews,
so now you would think that within this

1171
00:57:51,721 --> 00:57:56,160
very small group of people called Jews
within an even smaller group of people

1172
00:57:56,161 --> 00:58:00,140
called Hasidic Orthodox Jews,
once you're an Orthodox Jew,

1173
00:58:00,141 --> 00:58:01,740
you're an Orthodox Jew.
No,

1174
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:06,920
on this side of the street are the
Polish Orthodox Jews on this side of the

1175
00:58:07,171 --> 00:58:12,171
street are the Hungarian Orthodox Jews
and I wouldn't be caught dead marrying

1176
00:58:12,901 --> 00:58:15,780
my daughter to those heathen pigs from
the other side of the street.

1177
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:20,520
So in other words,
our ability to create a US versus them

1178
00:58:20,521 --> 00:58:22,280
distinctions,
as you said is,

1179
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:24,060
is infinite.
That's what,

1180
00:58:24,061 --> 00:58:26,460
by the way,
I hate most about religion and not only

1181
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:27,294
Islam,
right?

1182
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:32,580
Certainly every abrahamic religion has a
very clear delineation between us and

1183
00:58:32,581 --> 00:58:33,370
them.
Uh,

1184
00:58:33,370 --> 00:58:36,300
if we are Christians,
we're going to have in the rest of you

1185
00:58:36,301 --> 00:58:39,480
who haven't accepted Jesus are going to
hell if you are Jewish,

1186
00:58:39,570 --> 00:58:41,520
they are the Jews and they are the
goals,

1187
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:43,050
right?
Then the gentiles.

1188
00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:46,740
If you are Muslim,
of course there are US Muslim believers

1189
00:58:46,741 --> 00:58:48,660
and all of you could fought,
right?

1190
00:58:48,930 --> 00:58:53,930
And so it's an inherent part of
Abrahamic faith to play on this very

1191
00:58:54,211 --> 00:58:56,700
innate mechanism of tribalism.
US versus them.

1192
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:00,300
It's grotesque.
And it's also what happened in Iraq when

1193
00:59:00,301 --> 00:59:01,134
we

1194
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:05,490
got rid of Saddam Hussein,
it created a civil war between two rival

1195
00:59:05,491 --> 00:59:08,040
factions of Islam,
Shia and the Sunni,

1196
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:11,910
which most people had no idea that was
even a situation over there.

1197
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:13,180
Exactly.
Exactly.

1198
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:15,730
But should we,
you want to talk?

1199
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:22,130
So I was very interested in asking him
things that I actually thought about

1200
00:59:22,131 --> 00:59:25,100
studying scientifically as part of my
research.

1201
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:26,870
So one of the things that I study as you
know,

1202
00:59:26,871 --> 00:59:27,740
is,
well,

1203
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,410
I apply evolutionary psychology,
all sorts of things.

1204
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:32,630
One of which is mating preferences.
You know,

1205
00:59:32,631 --> 00:59:36,710
are there certain mating preferences
that are universally true irrespective

1206
00:59:36,711 --> 00:59:37,640
of culture.
Right?

1207
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:41,000
And the answer of course is yes.
So whether you go to the Animal Momo

1208
00:59:41,001 --> 00:59:43,700
tribe in Brazil,
a closed society,

1209
00:59:43,701 --> 00:59:46,550
or you go walk around in La,
they are certain things that men will

1210
00:59:46,551 --> 00:59:48,920
look for in women and other things that
women will look for.

1211
00:59:48,921 --> 00:59:52,490
And men that tend to be universal's for
clear evolutionary reasons.

1212
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:57,080
So I was interested at one point in
studying the mating preferences of the

1213
00:59:57,081 --> 00:59:59,300
Hasidic community.
Again,

1214
00:59:59,301 --> 01:00:02,630
the idea being that here you're taking a
community that culturally and

1215
01:00:02,631 --> 01:00:06,560
religiously is very close where the
cultural and religious brainwashing is

1216
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:07,790
very,
very strong.

1217
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:11,420
And in this moment is movement that
you're making with your hands.

1218
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:15,710
Does that represent the sheet with the
hole in it as you're doing this thing?

1219
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:17,690
Keeps doing this thing with your hand?
Must Be.

1220
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:20,530
It must be a subconscious thing.
Yes.

1221
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:23,420
Is that a real.
I don't know if it's real.

1222
01:00:23,421 --> 01:00:25,190
I'm adding her.
Might be the ostrich thing.

1223
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:26,570
It must be.
Maybe it's a,

1224
01:00:26,571 --> 01:00:29,960
it's a find out if we're talking about
explaining what we're talking about,

1225
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:33,560
the idea,
the idea is that when a hasidic couple

1226
01:00:33,561 --> 01:00:36,080
has sex,
they have a sheet between them where

1227
01:00:36,081 --> 01:00:40,100
they make a hole where the genitalia
goes and that's how you get it all.

1228
01:00:40,130 --> 01:00:41,840
That's what I thought.
Why you kept doing that.

1229
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,540
Maybe it was a freudian thing.
Uh,

1230
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:51,040
and so my idea was at one point is to
see if I can get access to the Hasidic

1231
01:00:51,261 --> 01:00:53,390
community,
which will probably not be easy to get

1232
01:00:53,391 --> 01:00:55,880
into the Hasidic community and ask them
about their mating preferences.

1233
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:01,610
And so it was a small idea I had over an
afternoon and then kind of dropped it

1234
01:01:01,611 --> 01:01:04,610
and moved on to other things.
But here I was sitting with a couple of

1235
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:06,530
hesitant couple and I thought,
okay,

1236
01:01:06,531 --> 01:01:09,830
I can't do a scientific study,
but at least I could come up with some

1237
01:01:09,831 --> 01:01:13,040
anecdotes to discuss.
And so I actually asked them things

1238
01:01:13,041 --> 01:01:14,240
like,
uh,

1239
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:15,050
you know,
can you,

1240
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:17,750
can we talk about some meeting
preferences that take place within the

1241
01:01:17,751 --> 01:01:20,030
Hasidic community?
And there were some really incredible

1242
01:01:20,031 --> 01:01:22,070
insights that came out.
So for example,

1243
01:01:22,071 --> 01:01:25,490
the Wa,
the wife said that one of the attributes

1244
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:29,810
that she absolutely was looking for an
it perspective made was that he be

1245
01:01:29,870 --> 01:01:31,400
taller than her.
Okay.

1246
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:35,180
And it turns out that this is the,
this is called assortative mating.

1247
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:38,810
Birds of a feather flock together.
So if you look at naturally occurring

1248
01:01:38,811 --> 01:01:41,900
couples,
it is almost never the case that the

1249
01:01:41,901 --> 01:01:42,950
woman is taller than the man.

1250
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:46,520
There was actually a study done with 720
couples as single couple.

1251
01:01:46,850 --> 01:01:51,200
The woman was taller than the men.
So here's an example of a very basic

1252
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:56,150
physical desire and this case,
I just need the map not not to be tall,

1253
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,950
just taller than me.
Right.

1254
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:02,000
That was replicating in a completely
different context.

1255
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:04,850
And the Hasidic community,
I even asked them about things like,

1256
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:09,260
well,
we'll a hasidic woman ever look at a non

1257
01:02:09,261 --> 01:02:13,370
Hasidic guy that's walking down the
street of bad boy that has tattoos and

1258
01:02:13,371 --> 01:02:18,371
greased back here and you know,
the swimmer's body and desire him or has

1259
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:20,520
the cultural

1260
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:25,520
and religious brainwashing been so great
that her eyes are shut off to these

1261
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:28,560
possibilities?
And she actually said that.

1262
01:02:28,561 --> 01:02:32,670
No,
I mean the bottom line as Eo Wilson

1263
01:02:32,671 --> 01:02:35,340
said,
the jeans hold culture on a leash.

1264
01:02:35,341 --> 01:02:37,860
In other words,
no matter how much cultural and

1265
01:02:37,861 --> 01:02:41,790
religious brainwashing you have,
if you scratch far enough,

1266
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,060
you'll get the same human nature.
And that's what I basically got from my

1267
01:02:45,061 --> 01:02:48,030
conversation with them.
That's a fascinating way of describing

1268
01:02:48,031 --> 01:02:49,650
it.
The genes hold culture,

1269
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:50,720
lead shot,
Mike.

1270
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:52,920
Well that's great.
That's the o Wilson.

1271
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:56,840
That's a perfect way of saying it.
That's a nice.

1272
01:02:56,841 --> 01:02:58,890
Every now and then you hear a phrase and
you're like,

1273
01:02:58,910 --> 01:02:59,620
ah,
yeah,

1274
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:00,160
yeah.
He's,

1275
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:00,993
he's,
you know,

1276
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:05,610
I wish you could get him on your show.
I'm not sure if he's now probably 85.

1277
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:07,230
Do you know who Eo Wilson is?
No,

1278
01:03:07,231 --> 01:03:11,010
I do not.
So eo Wilson is a very famous,

1279
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:13,050
a scientist at Harvard.

1280
01:03:13,050 --> 01:03:14,730
I've heard the name,
I just don't know.

1281
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:16,230
Yeah,
he's amazing.

1282
01:03:16,231 --> 01:03:18,810
He's a by training.
He's an entomologist,

1283
01:03:18,811 --> 01:03:21,930
a insect scientist.
He specifically studies,

1284
01:03:22,350 --> 01:03:25,680
uh,
the social social ants basically.

1285
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:29,670
And so he looks at things like
reciprocal altruism,

1286
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:33,900
kin selection,
all of these mechanisms of altruism in

1287
01:03:33,901 --> 01:03:36,930
the context of b.
here's another quote that he has that I

1288
01:03:36,931 --> 01:03:39,990
love.
Communism slash socialism,

1289
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:42,720
great system,
wrong species.

1290
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:48,030
What he's basically saying is that that
political system of we're all equal

1291
01:03:48,031 --> 01:03:52,170
under communism is a great idea,
but it applies to social ants that

1292
01:03:52,171 --> 01:03:54,070
doesn't apply to humans.
Yeah.

1293
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:57,900
So he's got these wonderful pithy
quotes.

1294
01:03:57,901 --> 01:04:00,840
I wish,
I mean I know that Robert Sapolsky is

1295
01:04:00,841 --> 01:04:02,640
great,
but if Robert Sapolsky is great,

1296
01:04:02,850 --> 01:04:04,880
you need to get Eo Wilson on this
podcast and.

1297
01:04:04,881 --> 01:04:07,740
Well if it's possible I'll look into it.
Where did you say he is?

1298
01:04:07,770 --> 01:04:08,880
He's at Harvard.
Harvard.

1299
01:04:08,881 --> 01:04:10,320
So I'd probably have to come to him.

1300
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,540
Product Daddy travels a lot at this
stage.

1301
01:04:12,541 --> 01:04:14,670
It was probably,
well I'd be willing.

1302
01:04:15,030 --> 01:04:17,160
I'm going to be back there eventually,
I'm sure.

1303
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:20,970
So how often do you go back to Boston?
Well I haven't been in awhile.

1304
01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:23,010
I'm going to try and get there in the
spring.

1305
01:04:23,370 --> 01:04:28,140
I'm thinking about filming my next
Netflix special there was before I

1306
01:04:28,141 --> 01:04:28,921
started.
Right,

1307
01:04:28,921 --> 01:04:30,270
okay.
Trying to figure it out.

1308
01:04:30,271 --> 01:04:31,780
It's either going to be there here.
I think.

1309
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:33,600
Very nice.
Those was my two options.

1310
01:04:33,690 --> 01:04:36,030
Boston or California?
Very nice.

1311
01:04:36,090 --> 01:04:38,460
Seven figure either my current or
former.

1312
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:39,810
Right,
right.

1313
01:04:39,810 --> 01:04:41,280
I don't know.
But um,

1314
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:45,540
so when you talk to this guy for four
plus hours,

1315
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:46,740
um,
and my,

1316
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,310
my wife was pissed by the way.
Why?

1317
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:50,820
Because you didn't talk to her because
she felt ignored.

1318
01:04:50,821 --> 01:04:54,240
She felt like she was getting bored and
she have to take care of the kids while

1319
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:56,610
I was having this one is my fight.

1320
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:00,030
I thought later winter it had been
wonderful if we could have taped it and

1321
01:05:00,031 --> 01:05:02,910
I could have released this conversation
on my show.

1322
01:05:03,030 --> 01:05:05,640
Oh yeah.
Because it was so honest to keep in

1323
01:05:05,641 --> 01:05:08,880
touch with this guy and so we,
we exchange actually asked him

1324
01:05:08,881 --> 01:05:09,380
permission.
I'm,

1325
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:11,100
I didn't mention that.
I mentioned.

1326
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:12,270
I said,
would you mind,

1327
01:05:12,271 --> 01:05:14,480
I'm going on this very popular showed
would you?

1328
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:14,931
He goes,
no,

1329
01:05:14,931 --> 01:05:15,900
no,
go ahead and feel free.

1330
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:20,080
And so it would be cool to get you guys
together and moderate.

1331
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:20,871
Yeah,
that'd be cool.

1332
01:05:20,871 --> 01:05:22,420
That would be cool.
Well,

1333
01:05:22,421 --> 01:05:23,254
now,
um,

1334
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:27,520
it was an amicable conversation and I
really pushed him very politely.

1335
01:05:27,850 --> 01:05:30,040
Um,
so at one point I said to him,

1336
01:05:30,041 --> 01:05:32,530
you know,
what would be the evidence that you

1337
01:05:32,531 --> 01:05:37,531
would need to see to have any
questioning of your faith and his

1338
01:05:39,161 --> 01:05:41,560
answer,
which is a classic argument from the,

1339
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:44,110
I don't know if you know the term God of
the gaps.

1340
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:48,280
Are you familiar with that?
So God of the gaps is basically at one

1341
01:05:48,281 --> 01:05:50,380
point when we didn't know much in
science,

1342
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:53,320
God could be found explaining everything
right?

1343
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:54,880
Why does it happen?
Well,

1344
01:05:54,890 --> 01:05:58,270
God does it right now.
We find out that there is a very clear

1345
01:05:58,271 --> 01:06:02,260
material explanation for for a
lightening.

1346
01:06:02,261 --> 01:06:06,310
So now that's often how God goes and
hide somewhere else and now he

1347
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:11,370
constantly finds the small gaps where
science hasn't yet been able to uncover

1348
01:06:11,771 --> 01:06:14,740
an explanation and he hides there.
That's called the god of the gaps

1349
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:18,590
argument,
and so he used the granddaddy of God,

1350
01:06:18,591 --> 01:06:19,424
of the guy.
He goes,

1351
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:24,310
if you take me back to the Big Bang and
you show me that there was no god at

1352
01:06:24,311 --> 01:06:28,320
that point,
then I'm willing to renounce my faith to

1353
01:06:28,390 --> 01:06:31,660
which I answered.
Even if I were able to do that,

1354
01:06:32,050 --> 01:06:36,460
you would still find a way to finagle
your way into justifying your belief.

1355
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:38,770
In other words,
there is no amount of evidence that I

1356
01:06:38,771 --> 01:06:41,950
could ever provide you that would shake
your foundation.

1357
01:06:41,951 --> 01:06:44,440
So we really got into some heavy stuff.
By the way,

1358
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:48,880
that's one of the differences between,
I think in his case he's an extremist

1359
01:06:48,881 --> 01:06:52,570
Jew in the sense that he is the most
practicing of Jews.

1360
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:54,640
Well,
how come we could have this very,

1361
01:06:54,641 --> 01:06:59,641
very difficult conversation and leave at
the end shaking hands both richer for it

1362
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:02,230
and no one's heads come off.
Well,

1363
01:07:02,231 --> 01:07:03,700
you were also a Jew though.
I mean,

1364
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:04,541
did it help?
I mean,

1365
01:07:04,541 --> 01:07:07,180
what if he had that conversation with a
Muslim?

1366
01:07:07,210 --> 01:07:10,840
Don't you think that maybe maybe there's
more intention but nobody's head would

1367
01:07:10,841 --> 01:07:14,610
be at least the John United Airlines.
Right?

1368
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:18,910
My point is that I think part of Jewish
tradition,

1369
01:07:18,970 --> 01:07:20,050
even when you,
for example,

1370
01:07:20,051 --> 01:07:22,510
go to the yeshiva to study,
say mood,

1371
01:07:22,870 --> 01:07:26,860
is that there is this mechanism of we
constantly argue about everything.

1372
01:07:26,890 --> 01:07:29,050
Nothing is settled.
We have to debate over everything,

1373
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:34,440
so you have to have that openness of
spirit to have your ideas question and I

1374
01:07:35,111 --> 01:07:38,810
think that if already Islam we're open
to that a bit more than maybe it would

1375
01:07:38,811 --> 01:07:41,200
be in a better place.
I've heard some of the most compelling

1376
01:07:41,201 --> 01:07:44,720
arguments against the big bang from
religious people and what?

1377
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:47,260
Give me some of those,
the argument against it is you are not

1378
01:07:47,261 --> 01:07:49,180
willing to believe that there is a
creator,

1379
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:53,770
that there is some sort of a system that
was put in place by a much higher power

1380
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:57,040
beyond what we can describe,
but you're willing to believe that

1381
01:07:57,041 --> 01:07:59,710
everything came out of nothing,
right?

1382
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:03,040
Something smaller than the head of a pin
for some reason that no one's ever

1383
01:08:03,041 --> 01:08:06,370
figured out.
And the only evidence that we have is

1384
01:08:06,371 --> 01:08:10,060
the radio wave echoes of this event,
right?

1385
01:08:10,270 --> 01:08:13,320
So this is A.
I mean,

1386
01:08:13,330 --> 01:08:16,380
I've heard similar arguments.
I mean Thomas is an acquaintance,

1387
01:08:16,790 --> 01:08:19,310
is the guy who always argued,
I think in the twelfth century,

1388
01:08:19,311 --> 01:08:24,080
but the first mover that you could
always go back and say at time zero.

1389
01:08:24,081 --> 01:08:25,670
What started that?
What started the,

1390
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:29,070
uh,
I don't think you could ever really a

1391
01:08:29,660 --> 01:08:31,580
ultimately shake somebody foundations,
right?

1392
01:08:31,581 --> 01:08:34,040
There's no amount of money.
Forget about the idea of shaking

1393
01:08:34,041 --> 01:08:38,870
someone's belief system.
It is odd that we're all willing to

1394
01:08:38,871 --> 01:08:43,871
believe the most insane version of the
creation of the universe ever without a

1395
01:08:45,081 --> 01:08:47,180
doubt,
like every person of science,

1396
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:51,980
people that believe in genes and atoms
and subatomic particles and corks and

1397
01:08:51,981 --> 01:08:55,430
glue ons,
and they believe that at one point in

1398
01:08:55,431 --> 01:08:59,180
time there was something that was
smaller than the head of a pin that

1399
01:08:59,181 --> 01:09:04,181
became the infinite space that we see in
front of us that's constantly expanding

1400
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:06,020
and so infant that.

1401
01:09:06,710 --> 01:09:09,020
One of the things that Lawrence Krauss
really,

1402
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:11,270
really fucked my mind up when he was
here.

1403
01:09:11,690 --> 01:09:14,960
He was explaining to me that when we're
seeing the universe and we're talking

1404
01:09:14,961 --> 01:09:19,700
about 13 point 7 billion years or
whatever it is you're seeing as it was.

1405
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:20,450
Well,
yes,

1406
01:09:20,450 --> 01:09:23,240
not just seeing it as it was,
but he said you're only seeing the

1407
01:09:23,241 --> 01:09:28,241
observable universe because the universe
itself is moving faster than the light

1408
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:34,280
that you see from it.
So it's entirely possible that it goes

1409
01:09:34,281 --> 01:09:37,580
back far further than that.
You just can't see it.

1410
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:41,780
Right.
And you'll listen to Richard Dawkins,

1411
01:09:41,930 --> 01:09:45,890
the guy that we talked about earlier
about selfish gene has a wonderful

1412
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:48,290
concept.
It's called middle world.

1413
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:49,820
Have you heard this before?
No,

1414
01:09:49,821 --> 01:09:53,390
but I read it.
Or jrr Tolkien's middle earth.

1415
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:54,291
Is that.
Oh,

1416
01:09:54,291 --> 01:09:56,690
that's a load of ranks.
Okay.

1417
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:58,190
I'm not,
I'm not too familiar with that stuff,

1418
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:00,820
but he talks about middle world.

1419
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:05,880
The idea being that our brains evolved
to understand phenomena at a level that

1420
01:10:07,730 --> 01:10:09,170
our brain interacts with.
Right.

1421
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:12,800
He caused that middle world so that
which is that the cosmological level

1422
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:17,960
right at the Lawrence Krauss level of
cosmology or at the national level,

1423
01:10:18,650 --> 01:10:20,390
quantum,
quantum physics.

1424
01:10:20,690 --> 01:10:25,690
It's so esoteric that our brains haven't
evolved to understand phenomena at that

1425
01:10:27,141 --> 01:10:28,280
level.
Right.

1426
01:10:28,370 --> 01:10:32,300
So in a sense,
it's counter intuitive for us to even do

1427
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:33,200
that.
I mean,

1428
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:36,260
think about it when you and I are
actually most physicists when they study

1429
01:10:36,261 --> 01:10:39,740
things at those levels,
they will tell you that this stuff is so

1430
01:10:39,770 --> 01:10:40,490
esoteric.
Right?

1431
01:10:40,490 --> 01:10:42,300
Richard Fineman the very famous
physicist,

1432
01:10:42,301 --> 01:10:43,190
but I said,
you know,

1433
01:10:43,191 --> 01:10:44,050
if you,
if you,

1434
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:46,190
if you think you understand quantum
physics,

1435
01:10:46,220 --> 01:10:48,440
you don't understand quantum physics or
something to that effect,

1436
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:53,780
that it is so esoteric and difficult for
human brains to understand things at

1437
01:10:53,781 --> 01:10:57,080
that level,
small or very big so,

1438
01:10:57,290 --> 01:11:00,950
but that not withstanding,
that doesn't mean that scientists

1439
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:06,230
succumb to belief just like religious
people do because scientists have

1440
01:11:06,650 --> 01:11:10,910
epistemic humility,
which basically means what I'm always

1441
01:11:10,911 --> 01:11:14,250
willing to see data if Rogan tomorrow

1442
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:19,230
she comes to me with data showing that
the mechanisms of evolution as an

1443
01:11:19,231 --> 01:11:24,030
unstated starting with Darwin are wrong.
Then I would be a dishonest scientist to

1444
01:11:24,031 --> 01:11:27,120
not revise my beliefs in light of Joe
Rogan's evidence.

1445
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:30,000
So in other words,
scientists are always open.

1446
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:31,820
It's always provisional knowledge.
It's,

1447
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:37,020
it's only the best that we have now.
Whereas in religion it's revealed truth.

1448
01:11:38,070 --> 01:11:41,490
It is true because it is true because
it's in my book because it's true.

1449
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:45,300
So in a sense,
religious people are epistemologically

1450
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:49,140
hottie they're arrogant because nothing
could change their opinions.

1451
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:51,710
Whereas science has changed your
opinions every day.

1452
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:54,540
So in that sense,
I don't think we're both succumbing to

1453
01:11:54,541 --> 01:11:57,500
belief systems now.
I'm not necessarily saying that I'm not,

1454
01:11:57,530 --> 01:12:00,090
and I'm not equating them,
I'm not saying they're equal,

1455
01:12:00,091 --> 01:12:04,050
but it is an odd belief and not
necessarily even belief,

1456
01:12:04,051 --> 01:12:06,200
for lack of a better word,
but it's an odd,

1457
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:11,240
it's an odd concept that because we know
that this exists and because we have

1458
01:12:12,301 --> 01:12:17,301
some sort of residual trace of an
explosion a long time ago,

1459
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:20,490
you can try and it's mind blowing.

1460
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:21,270
I mean,
I,

1461
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:25,020
I probably just as a layperson in
physics,

1462
01:12:25,270 --> 01:12:28,120
uh,
probably one percent of what I see in a

1463
01:12:28,121 --> 01:12:32,250
national geographic on physics I can
even remotely understand,

1464
01:12:32,251 --> 01:12:33,650
right?
Because it just seems so.

1465
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:36,570
And it's not as though I'm not capable
of complex thought,

1466
01:12:36,571 --> 01:12:38,970
but it's just so difficult for human
minds.

1467
01:12:39,370 --> 01:12:40,680
You know,
what does it mean?

1468
01:12:40,681 --> 01:12:42,480
16 dollars,
billion light years away,

1469
01:12:42,481 --> 01:12:43,110
right?
I mean,

1470
01:12:43,110 --> 01:12:45,990
for the light to travel for $16,
billion light years,

1471
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:47,250
that's the envelope.
I mean,

1472
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:49,860
how do you understand these kinds of.
It's too big.

1473
01:12:50,330 --> 01:12:53,710
And then the concept of life and death
is also luck.

1474
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:57,570
Our physical limitations because we know
that we live and die and we know that

1475
01:12:57,571 --> 01:13:01,740
the sun is going to burn out and we know
that life on earth lives and dies and

1476
01:13:01,741 --> 01:13:02,381
things,
so we,

1477
01:13:02,381 --> 01:13:07,381
we impose these physical restrictions on
the very universe itself when in fact it

1478
01:13:07,591 --> 01:13:12,591
might be some constant process of
expanding and contracting.

1479
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:17,220
That's one of the most disturbing ideas
is that the universe is gonna expand

1480
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:21,450
infinitely and then contract infinitely
and then do it all over again.

1481
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:22,950
So that,
I mean,

1482
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:24,870
I don't know if this is even a correct
theory.

1483
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:26,670
I don't know if maybe it's been
disputed,

1484
01:13:26,671 --> 01:13:30,450
but I had read once that there was a
theory that the universe contracts to

1485
01:13:30,451 --> 01:13:35,451
some insanely infinite position and then
retracts down to the head of a pin

1486
01:13:35,461 --> 01:13:36,294
again.
Right.

1487
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:39,960
And then the whole big bang is this
continual process that might take,

1488
01:13:40,150 --> 01:13:42,390
you know,
a hundred trillion years or something

1489
01:13:42,391 --> 01:13:44,100
insane.
I don't know.

1490
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:46,410
I don't know if you understand one
percent.

1491
01:13:46,411 --> 01:13:49,260
I understand zero,
zero,

1492
01:13:49,261 --> 01:13:52,560
zero point one.
I actually had this physicist on my

1493
01:13:52,561 --> 01:13:54,780
show.
He might be a fun guy to have on your

1494
01:13:54,781 --> 01:13:55,770
show.
Uh,

1495
01:13:56,040 --> 01:14:00,340
his name is Lee Smolin a,
he's a guy who produced.

1496
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:05,720
The way that I discovered his work is
that I was looking for every possible

1497
01:14:06,241 --> 01:14:10,890
field that I could think of where
evolutionary theory has been infused

1498
01:14:10,891 --> 01:14:12,070
into field.
Right?

1499
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:13,750
So for example,
in my case,

1500
01:14:13,751 --> 01:14:16,180
I apply evolutionary psychology and
consumer behavior.

1501
01:14:16,210 --> 01:14:19,330
You could study criminal criminality
from an evolutionary perspective.

1502
01:14:19,331 --> 01:14:21,970
You can study medicine.
And so I was trying to come up with a

1503
01:14:21,971 --> 01:14:26,080
table that listed all of the various
scientific disciplines where

1504
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:31,270
evolutionary principles have made
headway and the field at the highest

1505
01:14:31,271 --> 01:14:32,740
level.
Remember we were talking about middle

1506
01:14:32,741 --> 01:14:37,741
world and the cosmos.
He argued that the process of natural

1507
01:14:38,321 --> 01:14:43,321
selection operates at the cosmological
level where this grand set of universes

1508
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:48,790
are being selected.
In other words,

1509
01:14:48,791 --> 01:14:50,440
in the same way that we select genes,
right?

1510
01:14:50,441 --> 01:14:53,470
Some jeans get selected and others die
out.

1511
01:14:53,980 --> 01:14:58,390
That that mechanism,
sort of a cosmological natural selection

1512
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:01,960
at the cosmological level.
And so that's how I first this.

1513
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:04,720
It is so mind blowing.
It is so esoteric.

1514
01:15:04,721 --> 01:15:07,650
It's so difficult to so nonpalpable that
it,

1515
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:10,120
it,
it borders on taking mushrooms or

1516
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:12,340
psychedelics that that's how mind
blowing.

1517
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:14,860
So you should.
Maybe you should check out our chat on

1518
01:15:14,861 --> 01:15:17,080
my show is really cool guy.
You might enjoy them.

1519
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:18,490
Well,
it is fascinating.

1520
01:15:18,491 --> 01:15:23,491
We think of how much the universe,
how many possibilities exist in the

1521
01:15:24,011 --> 01:15:24,830
universe,
right?

1522
01:15:24,830 --> 01:15:26,890
I mean how many different source
systems?

1523
01:15:26,891 --> 01:15:30,430
Just hundreds of billions just in this
galaxy.

1524
01:15:30,790 --> 01:15:34,420
One of hundreds of billions of gallons.
It's almost like for our little tiny

1525
01:15:34,421 --> 01:15:37,090
world,
so when we try to look at it in terms of

1526
01:15:37,091 --> 01:15:39,490
the big picture,
we're not capable.

1527
01:15:39,550 --> 01:15:43,930
We don't have enough processing power.
We don't have enough hard drive space.

1528
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:49,140
We can't take all of these points of
data and bring them into our head and

1529
01:15:49,691 --> 01:15:52,300
consider them,
but it's entirely possible that

1530
01:15:52,301 --> 01:15:55,870
everything you see in the world in terms
of competition,

1531
01:15:56,110 --> 01:15:59,080
everything you see in the human world in
terms of competition,

1532
01:15:59,081 --> 01:16:04,000
natural selection,
and the constant and never ending desire

1533
01:16:04,001 --> 01:16:05,950
for innovation,
for novelty,

1534
01:16:05,951 --> 01:16:06,940
for new things.

1535
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:10,960
We have this constant desire to improve
upon every single thing that we've ever

1536
01:16:10,961 --> 01:16:14,050
done.
No one ever looks at like a car,

1537
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:16,510
I mean,
and says this is the best car ever,

1538
01:16:16,580 --> 01:16:18,400
will not be improved upon.
We're done.

1539
01:16:18,401 --> 01:16:20,120
We don't need to make cars anymore.
Right?

1540
01:16:20,230 --> 01:16:22,720
They always want to come up with
something that has better airbags,

1541
01:16:22,990 --> 01:16:24,430
faster,
zero to 60,

1542
01:16:24,431 --> 01:16:28,090
more protection for the passenger,
automated controls,

1543
01:16:28,091 --> 01:16:31,030
you know you can sit back and sleep
while your car drives you to work.

1544
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:34,180
There's all these things that we just
take for granted,

1545
01:16:34,181 --> 01:16:38,470
but they're always moving in the
direction of improvement and you could

1546
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:42,310
do that with life on earth.
You go back to single celled organisms

1547
01:16:42,490 --> 01:16:45,820
which become multi celled organisms and
we always look at it like,

1548
01:16:45,821 --> 01:16:47,470
oh,
that's just a coincidence and it's

1549
01:16:47,471 --> 01:16:50,200
dinosaurs,
and then it becomes mammos and then it

1550
01:16:50,201 --> 01:16:54,220
becomes humans.
Then it becomes air plane riding,

1551
01:16:54,221 --> 01:16:57,610
cell phone using video,
having.

1552
01:16:57,850 --> 01:17:00,550
You know what I mean?
It just gets more and more complex,

1553
01:17:00,730 --> 01:17:01,271
but we just,
oh,

1554
01:17:01,271 --> 01:17:03,940
that's just coincidence.
Is it?

1555
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:09,360
Or is it moving in this constant state
of improvement until we create an

1556
01:17:09,860 --> 01:17:10,520
artificial

1557
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:15,520
being that can accelerate things far,
far faster than our biological

1558
01:17:16,221 --> 01:17:20,120
limitations are capable of doing it.
So I'm not sure if this is where you

1559
01:17:20,121 --> 01:17:21,350
want to go,
but as you,

1560
01:17:21,351 --> 01:17:24,320
as you were describing this sort of
quest for improvement,

1561
01:17:24,860 --> 01:17:25,980
one of the,
uh,

1562
01:17:26,150 --> 01:17:31,150
one of the threats of that reflects,
or one of the dangers of that reflex is

1563
01:17:31,551 --> 01:17:36,551
precisely how totalitarian ideologies
develop where they argued that our

1564
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:41,920
current state of the world is faulty.
And if only you implement our ideology,

1565
01:17:43,221 --> 01:17:45,590
the shoe,
it could be communism.

1566
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:47,630
It could be,
it could be perfect.

1567
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,450
Then it could be perfect socialism.
Exactly.

1568
01:17:50,451 --> 01:17:52,670
So,
so there is a way by which we could

1569
01:17:52,671 --> 01:17:57,650
reach that utopia if only you adhere to
our ideology.

1570
01:17:57,890 --> 01:18:00,980
So there's a real danger in sort of
succumbing to that.

1571
01:18:00,981 --> 01:18:01,900
And by the way,
that's one of the.

1572
01:18:01,970 --> 01:18:04,970
I'm reading right now,
a book by William Gardner who might come

1573
01:18:04,971 --> 01:18:05,360
on my show.

1574
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:07,100
He's a,
I think a political scientist.

1575
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:11,900
His book is called the great divide
where he actually lays out some of the

1576
01:18:11,990 --> 01:18:16,280
sort of fundamental,
foundational differences between

1577
01:18:16,281 --> 01:18:20,480
Liberals and conservatives in terms of
their world views and how because of the

1578
01:18:20,481 --> 01:18:22,520
starting positions being sold,
different,

1579
01:18:22,550 --> 01:18:25,820
having no overlap between them,
the venn diagrams don't overlap.

1580
01:18:26,150 --> 01:18:29,450
That's why you ended up speaking over
each other without being able to find

1581
01:18:29,451 --> 01:18:32,930
common grounds.
So one of these differences is that an

1582
01:18:32,950 --> 01:18:35,060
I,
I described something similar using

1583
01:18:35,061 --> 01:18:37,100
different terms.
A lot of the quote,

1584
01:18:37,101 --> 01:18:42,101
liberals and progressives view our brain
as being blank slates,

1585
01:18:43,191 --> 01:18:46,730
right?
It's infinitely malleable and so if you

1586
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:51,320
see differences between people,
it can't be because there was a starting

1587
01:18:51,321 --> 01:18:56,321
point difference.
Michael Jordan was not innately likely

1588
01:18:56,601 --> 01:19:00,650
to be better than you in basketball.
There were some environmental conditions

1589
01:19:00,830 --> 01:19:05,300
that lead Michael Jordan to become who
he is and not get sad to be the best nba

1590
01:19:05,301 --> 01:19:06,134
player ever.

1591
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:10,580
And if only we can find the appropriate
social intervention strategies,

1592
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:13,250
then we could all have equality of
outcomes.

1593
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:18,170
And so that is a faulty understanding of
human nature because human nature,

1594
01:19:18,171 --> 01:19:19,370
as you of course,
you know,

1595
01:19:19,610 --> 01:19:23,750
it's really an interaction of our
biology and our environment.

1596
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:28,640
But so much of the welfare state is
based on this idea that no,

1597
01:19:28,641 --> 01:19:33,140
we need more of your tax money so that
we could implement a social engineering

1598
01:19:33,141 --> 01:19:38,141
program so that we could reach that
utopia where we're all equal outcome.

1599
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:40,910
And frankly I think that that's complete
nonsense.

1600
01:19:41,060 --> 01:19:45,680
It is fascinating that people seek
comfort in communism and socialism for

1601
01:19:45,681 --> 01:19:48,710
that very reason.
Like they almost are trying to slow down

1602
01:19:48,711 --> 01:19:50,810
the competition that they can't win.
Right?

1603
01:19:50,811 --> 01:19:51,980
Exactly.
Yeah,

1604
01:19:52,050 --> 01:19:53,780
I see it by the way,
by my university.

1605
01:19:53,781 --> 01:19:58,010
So in Canada there's a very sort of
social welfare states and Quebec,

1606
01:19:58,130 --> 01:20:01,700
the province where I live is sort of
socialist on welfare,

1607
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:02,630
on steroids.

1608
01:20:03,020 --> 01:20:04,930
And so in the context of the
university's,

1609
01:20:05,620 --> 01:20:10,620
every,
all of the metrics of reward are removed

1610
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:12,900
so that we can have equality of
outcomes.

1611
01:20:12,901 --> 01:20:15,000
And the way that you instantiate that is
through,

1612
01:20:15,230 --> 01:20:16,380
uh,
the unions,

1613
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:18,930
right?
So there's a very powerful union that

1614
01:20:18,931 --> 01:20:23,160
ensures that all professors are roughly
treated equally because we're all social

1615
01:20:23,161 --> 01:20:25,590
ads.
There's a queen bee and then the rest of

1616
01:20:25,591 --> 01:20:28,440
us are all equal,
but of course humans are not equal.

1617
01:20:28,441 --> 01:20:30,210
Some are smarter,
some work harder,

1618
01:20:30,330 --> 01:20:32,270
some are more apathetic,
some are honest,

1619
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:36,030
some are cheaters.
And so this idea of constantly having to

1620
01:20:36,031 --> 01:20:41,031
have some external agent managed the
process so that we could all be equal to

1621
01:20:41,461 --> 01:20:44,220
me is grotesque.
And it goes back to I think probably our

1622
01:20:44,221 --> 01:20:46,470
first conversation you and I had when I
was saying that,

1623
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:48,330
you know,
I would love to eventually come through

1624
01:20:48,331 --> 01:20:51,690
southern California because at least in
the United States,

1625
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:56,190
the society has been less progressive
dies by the social welfare idea.

1626
01:20:56,190 --> 01:20:59,700
Of course the Democrats are more so than
the Republicans.

1627
01:20:59,970 --> 01:21:04,970
But as a general rule,
Canada is basically pure social welfare.

1628
01:21:05,221 --> 01:21:08,130
We're all equal.
And of course Justin Trudeau is

1629
01:21:08,131 --> 01:21:10,320
certainly trying to push that idea even
more.

1630
01:21:10,321 --> 01:21:12,780
He's too handsome.
That's that guy's problem he's trying to

1631
01:21:12,781 --> 01:21:15,960
make up for the fact that it's beautiful
and he's trying to be super sweet to

1632
01:21:15,961 --> 01:21:17,460
everybody.
That's what's going on up there.

1633
01:21:17,610 --> 01:21:20,610
Did you hear about the.
I just put up a clip a few days ago

1634
01:21:20,611 --> 01:21:23,580
about the Ahmad.
How their case do you know that is.

1635
01:21:23,810 --> 01:21:26,720
No,
actually a few people tweeted,

1636
01:21:26,730 --> 01:21:28,500
oh,
please talk to Joe Rogan about this.

1637
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:29,810
Uh,
so all my,

1638
01:21:29,830 --> 01:21:30,830
how that is,
uh,

1639
01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:35,940
uh,
a Muslim guy whose family had become

1640
01:21:35,941 --> 01:21:39,420
Canadian citizens,
but the father had taken them away.

1641
01:21:39,421 --> 01:21:41,880
I think the Pakistan at one point until
Afghanistan in another.

1642
01:21:42,490 --> 01:21:44,920
Uh,
and at one point they were living in

1643
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,020
Bali bomb territory.

1644
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:51,020
This is 2002 I think.
And the US military had engaged in some

1645
01:21:52,111 --> 01:21:53,270
firefight,
a,

1646
01:21:53,350 --> 01:21:56,000
at one point they even lived in the
compound of bin Ladin.

1647
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:58,890
So these were really real apple Pie
Canadian folks.

1648
01:21:59,730 --> 01:22:04,730
And all my father who was 15 years old
apparently threw a grenade engaged in a

1649
01:22:05,191 --> 01:22:08,130
firefight,
killed one a US soldier,

1650
01:22:08,430 --> 01:22:13,050
and I think blind that his second one,
he was taken to Guantanamo Bay as a 15

1651
01:22:13,051 --> 01:22:14,910
year old,
spent many years there.

1652
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:20,360
He was a military tribunal.
US Guantanamo tribunals gave him a

1653
01:22:21,631 --> 01:22:25,680
symbolic sentence of 40 years.
But it was symbolic in that I think it

1654
01:22:25,681 --> 01:22:29,190
was only going to be a h here.
They agreed on a plea deal of eight

1655
01:22:29,191 --> 01:22:30,024
years.
Okay.

1656
01:22:30,450 --> 01:22:34,890
Then he was extradited to Canada very
quickly after that he was released

1657
01:22:34,891 --> 01:22:39,330
because you already served quite a few
years in Guantanamo and then he filed a

1658
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:45,080
lawsuit against the Canadian government
for not having protected his Canadian

1659
01:22:46,380 --> 01:22:49,860
charter rights because he was a child
soldier and so on.

1660
01:22:50,190 --> 01:22:55,190
And he just settled on a 10 point
$5,000,000 settlement and an official

1661
01:22:57,090 --> 01:23:00,840
apology by the Canadian government.
Uh,

1662
01:23:00,990 --> 01:23:03,330
and then some,
most people were outraged.

1663
01:23:03,690 --> 01:23:06,430
Most Canadians are outraged.
But then you should see the comments and

1664
01:23:06,431 --> 01:23:08,260
some of my,
on my youtube channel,

1665
01:23:09,180 --> 01:23:11,260
you know,
what kind of pig are you talking to me

1666
01:23:11,261 --> 01:23:15,040
that I would not understand that this
was an innocent child soldier who.

1667
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:17,410
Yeah,
because most of us are usually hanging

1668
01:23:17,411 --> 01:23:20,630
around when we were 15 and the compound
of the law than,

1669
01:23:20,830 --> 01:23:23,740
and lobbing bombs at incoming marines.
You know,

1670
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:25,750
it's a very Canadian apple pie thing to
do.

1671
01:23:26,110 --> 01:23:29,590
So again,
the reflex is not to be outraged at my

1672
01:23:29,591 --> 01:23:33,850
taxpayers are funding this guy now in a
10 point $5,000,000 settlement.

1673
01:23:34,180 --> 01:23:37,340
I'm a pig.
I'm a racist pig for not understanding

1674
01:23:37,341 --> 01:23:40,630
that this was just an innocent child
soldier at the wrong place at the wrong

1675
01:23:40,631 --> 01:23:41,464
time.

1676
01:23:41,530 --> 01:23:43,840
Okay,
let's look at two different things.

1677
01:23:43,841 --> 01:23:45,460
One,
the amount of money they gave him.

1678
01:23:45,461 --> 01:23:47,800
Yeah.
It's kind of crazy that your tax dollars

1679
01:23:47,801 --> 01:23:50,800
go to that,
but let's look at the 15 year old kid,

1680
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:54,400
right?
What do you expect and what could

1681
01:23:54,401 --> 01:23:59,400
possibly be done to dissuade him from
following this path?

1682
01:23:59,540 --> 01:24:02,530
He's living in bin Laden's compound.
You're talking about someone who's

1683
01:24:02,531 --> 01:24:06,310
vulnerable to ideology.
Fifty year old men are vulnerable to

1684
01:24:06,311 --> 01:24:09,160
ideology.
What about a 15 year old child?

1685
01:24:09,610 --> 01:24:14,560
Like I don't know how much blame you can
put on a kid now when it comes to

1686
01:24:14,890 --> 01:24:19,180
throwing a bomb at someone and taking
the life of another human being.

1687
01:24:20,420 --> 01:24:22,420
Well,
there's gotta be a lot of circumstances

1688
01:24:22,421 --> 01:24:24,280
involved in that.
I would like to know what they are

1689
01:24:24,281 --> 01:24:27,850
before I think about any judgment
whatsoever because I don't know.

1690
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:30,700
Were they shooting at him?
Were they shooting at someone he knew

1691
01:24:31,060 --> 01:24:33,730
someone who knew getting murdered by a
US soldier.

1692
01:24:33,910 --> 01:24:38,500
Was he actively engaged in some sort of
military training and considering

1693
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:40,300
becoming,
becoming a militant?

1694
01:24:40,301 --> 01:24:43,240
I don't know.
10 is a baby.

1695
01:24:45,010 --> 01:24:45,950
I mean yes and no.
Right?

1696
01:24:46,010 --> 01:24:49,790
I mean you can.
You can drive a car at 16 and Quebec.

1697
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:52,710
You can start driving drivers.
Yeah.

1698
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:54,920
At 15.
Is that what is my team?

1699
01:24:54,950 --> 01:24:55,460
Yeah,
my,

1700
01:24:55,460 --> 01:24:57,260
my,
my mother and father,

1701
01:24:57,350 --> 01:24:59,210
my mother,
my father was 19.

1702
01:24:59,211 --> 01:25:01,220
My mother was almost 16 when they got
married.

1703
01:25:02,030 --> 01:25:05,660
So you can procreate and have a child
that you don't understand the.

1704
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:08,620
Yeah,
but let's be real about physiologically

1705
01:25:08,621 --> 01:25:11,770
your frontal cortex isn't even formed
until you're 25.

1706
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:15,580
When you're 15 years old,
you're not capable of making like

1707
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:19,750
especially living in a war zone,
you're not capable of making moral and

1708
01:25:19,751 --> 01:25:23,350
ethical judgements above and beyond the
ideology that you're being raised.

1709
01:25:23,830 --> 01:25:24,670
Fair enough.
I mean,

1710
01:25:24,671 --> 01:25:25,121
I,
I,

1711
01:25:25,121 --> 01:25:29,440
I agree that most of us in that
situation may not have been able to

1712
01:25:29,441 --> 01:25:32,680
extricate ourselves from that.
And what I'm going to say next doesn't

1713
01:25:32,681 --> 01:25:37,330
necessarily support the outrage,
but it gives it greater context.

1714
01:25:37,331 --> 01:25:41,530
He does come from a family if you later,
if you check when we get off the air,

1715
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:46,690
the sort of the,
the cues of this family,

1716
01:25:46,930 --> 01:25:51,930
they don't seem as though they are
assimilating very nicely within Canadian

1717
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:53,770
value system.
In other words,

1718
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:59,250
for most Canadians,
the reflex of taking this guy who seems

1719
01:25:59,321 --> 01:26:03,920
to be quite resistant to liberty and
modernity freedoms

1720
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:06,830
and rewarding him with 10 point
$5,000,000,

1721
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:08,360
by the way,
this 10 point five Canadian.

1722
01:26:08,361 --> 01:26:11,870
So it's probably $30 American at this
point.

1723
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:13,900
The doctor thought we.
You guys were real similar.

1724
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:18,260
We were a few years ago.
We were at par and I think now we're at

1725
01:26:18,620 --> 01:26:21,350
one point three.
So we're about 20,

1726
01:26:21,410 --> 01:26:22,760
25,
30 percent less than you.

1727
01:26:22,761 --> 01:26:27,380
So that's how it was when I was a.
When I first used to go up to Montreal,

1728
01:26:27,660 --> 01:26:30,200
like in the nineties at the par or,
or different.

1729
01:26:30,230 --> 01:26:33,410
Different the way it is.
So you're saying now the American dollar

1730
01:26:33,411 --> 01:26:35,750
went far longer up there.
That's right,

1731
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:36,940
yeah.
It's,

1732
01:26:36,940 --> 01:26:39,740
it's heading back towards that now and
not at,

1733
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:42,200
not not to the worst.
The worst I've ever seen.

1734
01:26:42,201 --> 01:26:46,070
It was when we lived in California in
2001 to 2003.

1735
01:26:46,340 --> 01:26:51,340
At one point it was points 64 or 65.
Now it's at about point 75,

1736
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:53,630
so it's not the worst that it's ever
been,

1737
01:26:53,631 --> 01:26:54,770
but we're heading in that direction.

1738
01:26:55,250 --> 01:26:56,870
But since we're talking about kind of
the,

1739
01:26:56,880 --> 01:27:00,560
maybe you'd like to talk about a,
and I know that you've had Jordan

1740
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:03,500
Peterson on.
Did you follow both of our respective,

1741
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:05,310
uh,
uh,

1742
01:27:05,780 --> 01:27:09,920
testimonies in front of the Canadian
Senate regarding Bill 16 and you know,

1743
01:27:09,940 --> 01:27:14,240
I've read a lot of Jordan stuff on that.
I've seen him speak a lot and I've seen,

1744
01:27:14,270 --> 01:27:19,070
I saw that one conversation that he had
on television in Canada with some person

1745
01:27:19,071 --> 01:27:23,630
who is a professor in gender studies who
is ambiguously sexual.

1746
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:26,960
I don't know what they are,
whether it's a guy or a girl or a

1747
01:27:26,961 --> 01:27:29,600
transgender woman to man,
this is what it seemed to be,

1748
01:27:29,601 --> 01:27:30,434
right?
Yes.

1749
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:33,620
And the one who was saying that there's
no that gender,

1750
01:27:34,220 --> 01:27:37,910
there was no biological difference
between men and women.

1751
01:27:37,911 --> 01:27:40,940
Yes.
Which is just fucking horseshit.

1752
01:27:41,180 --> 01:27:43,490
I mean that is just like one plus one is
not too.

1753
01:27:43,490 --> 01:27:47,260
I mean it really is.
There's obviously a broad spectrum of

1754
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:52,960
variation and both sexes and they kind
of coalesce in the middle somewhere with

1755
01:27:53,481 --> 01:27:54,111
some.
Well,

1756
01:27:54,111 --> 01:27:57,710
what's amazing is that I've been
fighting this battle and academia

1757
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:01,430
precisely because of what I do,
which is introduce evolutionary

1758
01:28:01,431 --> 01:28:05,960
psychology and the social sciences.
So these types of conversations,

1759
01:28:05,961 --> 01:28:10,220
these ludicrous conversations I've been
experiencing them for for much of my

1760
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:13,490
scientific career.
What's extraordinary at this point is

1761
01:28:13,491 --> 01:28:17,520
that some of this nonsense is now
becoming law in Canada.

1762
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:20,450
So to kind of give you the background to
what happened.

1763
01:28:20,660 --> 01:28:22,940
So I was invited both speaking by the
Canadian Senate,

1764
01:28:22,941 --> 01:28:26,810
then also to give a talk in front of
parliament on Parliament Hill,

1765
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:31,250
but the Canadian Senate,
the part was built [inaudible],

1766
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:35,780
which is a bill that seeks to
incorporate gender identity and gender

1767
01:28:35,781 --> 01:28:39,380
expression under the rubric of hate
crimes.

1768
01:28:39,381 --> 01:28:40,490
Right?
So in the same way that I can

1769
01:28:40,491 --> 01:28:43,460
discriminate against you for your
religion or your race or your ethnicity,

1770
01:28:43,910 --> 01:28:47,480
I can't discriminate against you because
of your gender identity or gender

1771
01:28:47,481 --> 01:28:49,970
expression,
because then that would be a hate crime.

1772
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:54,830
And so I appeared in front of the
Canadian Senate to simply say that while

1773
01:28:54,831 --> 01:28:58,220
of course everybody's person who should
be respected and we're all equal under

1774
01:28:58,221 --> 01:29:01,430
the law,
the manner by which the bill was a

1775
01:29:01,470 --> 01:29:02,040
table,
the

1776
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:07,040
way it was written,
it was so vague as as it for it to be

1777
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:09,270
dangerous.
And so I gave examples.

1778
01:29:09,750 --> 01:29:12,180
So let me just mentioned a few here for
your viewers.

1779
01:29:12,540 --> 01:29:13,373
So I said,
look,

1780
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:17,460
Harvard University,
their lgbtq office,

1781
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:22,470
came out with a pamphlet that said that
the idea of promulgating,

1782
01:29:22,950 --> 01:29:27,270
and I'm going to quote fixed binaries
and biological essentialism,

1783
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:29,280
close quote,
fixed binaries,

1784
01:29:29,281 --> 01:29:30,750
means male,
female,

1785
01:29:31,590 --> 01:29:32,900
biological,
essentialism,

1786
01:29:32,940 --> 01:29:37,140
is to argue that anything is biological.
So the idea of a gay thing,

1787
01:29:37,170 --> 01:29:41,730
fixed binaries and biological
essentialism is a form of transphobic,

1788
01:29:41,820 --> 01:29:44,910
systemic violence.
This is not violence.

1789
01:29:44,940 --> 01:29:46,680
Violence is,
and it's not metaphorical.

1790
01:29:46,681 --> 01:29:47,930
It's not allegorical.
It's not bad.

1791
01:29:47,931 --> 01:29:52,020
I mean violence in quotes,
it is a form of Transphobia,

1792
01:29:52,050 --> 01:29:55,550
but specifically systemic violence,
transphobia know,

1793
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:59,430
how do they define violence because
there's a very specific definition of

1794
01:29:59,431 --> 01:30:01,890
violence.
While I don't know how they defined it

1795
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:07,230
in the general sense,
I think it's the desire to come up with

1796
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:10,150
ever broadening definitions of violence
so that any,

1797
01:30:10,210 --> 01:30:13,120
any trans question that you commit could
fit under that rubric.

1798
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:15,900
Even microaggression,
microaggression is a form of violence,

1799
01:30:15,990 --> 01:30:16,890
right?
So,

1800
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:18,930
so then I went in front of the Canadian
Senate.

1801
01:30:18,931 --> 01:30:19,430
Not,
I'm not you,

1802
01:30:19,430 --> 01:30:21,030
you could watch this later.
Uh,

1803
01:30:21,170 --> 01:30:22,950
it's on my channel.
I said,

1804
01:30:22,951 --> 01:30:26,940
look,
every single thing that I teach in my

1805
01:30:26,941 --> 01:30:31,941
courses would constitute transphobic
systemic violence based on that sort of

1806
01:30:32,431 --> 01:30:33,264
standard,
right?

1807
01:30:33,310 --> 01:30:35,190
It sound scientific data.
Exactly.

1808
01:30:35,191 --> 01:30:38,820
So if I get up and say,
here is how sexual selection works,

1809
01:30:38,821 --> 01:30:40,350
right?
Sexual selection is the mechanism that

1810
01:30:40,380 --> 01:30:43,860
explains how sex specific traits evolve.
Well,

1811
01:30:43,861 --> 01:30:48,240
sex specific traits evolve.
You recognize that there is male and

1812
01:30:48,241 --> 01:30:50,130
there's female.
Here's why.

1813
01:30:50,131 --> 01:30:54,990
Human males are likely to have been
sexually selected to be more risk

1814
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:56,010
takers.
Right?

1815
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:58,920
Well,
by engaging in that conversation,

1816
01:30:59,220 --> 01:31:04,220
I would be promulgating fixed binaries
and biological essentialism,

1817
01:31:05,370 --> 01:31:08,040
transphobic,
transphobic violence because a

1818
01:31:08,460 --> 01:31:10,230
transgendered student can come up to me
and say,

1819
01:31:10,231 --> 01:31:11,220
look,
professor,

1820
01:31:11,221 --> 01:31:14,220
you've thought your core,
I've listened to your course 13 weeks.

1821
01:31:14,220 --> 01:31:16,280
You talked about evolve mating
preferences on.

1822
01:31:16,530 --> 01:31:18,760
Not once did you talk about the
non-gender,

1823
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:21,600
the non binary,
that gender fluid,

1824
01:31:21,601 --> 01:31:23,430
the other kid,
and so on.

1825
01:31:23,630 --> 01:31:25,440
Uh,
that's marginalized me.

1826
01:31:25,441 --> 01:31:26,950
That's excluded me.
Uh,

1827
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:29,010
you're being biased,
you're being prejudicial.

1828
01:31:29,370 --> 01:31:34,370
So I tried to argue that most of the
liberal senators either laughed and

1829
01:31:35,551 --> 01:31:38,670
scoffed.
One of them accused me of being pro

1830
01:31:38,671 --> 01:31:41,160
genocide.
This is on record and the Canadian

1831
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:42,360
Senate.
So a scientist.

1832
01:31:42,361 --> 01:31:45,120
What's this person's name?
I think Senator Joel,

1833
01:31:45,121 --> 01:31:47,690
but I,
I started pushing the which has now

1834
01:31:47,700 --> 01:31:49,230
become maybe a,
an internet.

1835
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:52,170
You have a conversation with them and we
did it in there.

1836
01:31:52,380 --> 01:31:54,540
So we,
the conversation we had was promoting

1837
01:31:54,541 --> 01:31:55,610
genocide.
Someone said,

1838
01:31:55,620 --> 01:31:57,240
well,
how do you respond to that when someone

1839
01:31:57,241 --> 01:31:58,620
says that?
So that my response,

1840
01:31:58,621 --> 01:32:00,340
which you could,
I'm paraphrasing,

1841
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,031
he says,
well,

1842
01:32:01,031 --> 01:32:06,031
I'm not sure that given the fact that I
escape execution in Lebanon because of

1843
01:32:06,161 --> 01:32:10,380
my Jewish heritage,
that I need to be lectured about a

1844
01:32:10,660 --> 01:32:12,910
genocide,
and that sort of took them back.

1845
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:15,790
Now apparently later and I didn't see
this apparently later,

1846
01:32:15,791 --> 01:32:18,460
he wanted to retract some of these
comments and apologize for them.

1847
01:32:18,461 --> 01:32:21,250
I don't know if you are not.
How did they justify genocide?

1848
01:32:21,251 --> 01:32:23,320
Like what?
That's what happens when you have your

1849
01:32:23,321 --> 01:32:25,570
brain parenthesized by ostrich parasitic
syndrome.

1850
01:32:26,030 --> 01:32:29,080
How does,
how is it okay to study all of these

1851
01:32:29,081 --> 01:32:33,070
behavior patterns in aunts and monkeys
and dogs and what have you,

1852
01:32:33,310 --> 01:32:37,360
but you can't with human beings because
if you do with human being somehow or

1853
01:32:37,361 --> 01:32:41,890
another,
anything that you find about generalized

1854
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:46,920
behavior patterns or specific sexual
preferences that somehow or another

1855
01:32:48,460 --> 01:32:53,460
marginalizes or in some way diminishes
how another person is living their life

1856
01:32:53,891 --> 01:32:57,430
to the point where it becomes violence.
So there's actually a term for what you

1857
01:32:57,431 --> 01:33:00,100
just asked.
It's called the human reticence effect

1858
01:33:00,550 --> 01:33:04,750
and simply put,
a lot of people are perfectly happy to

1859
01:33:04,751 --> 01:33:09,430
use evolutionary arguments to explain
the behavior of the salamander,

1860
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:11,500
the Hyena,
the mosquito,

1861
01:33:11,590 --> 01:33:14,560
the dog,
but if you use the exact same

1862
01:33:14,590 --> 01:33:18,190
evolutionary principle to explain human
phenomena,

1863
01:33:18,430 --> 01:33:20,080
then suddenly it's no go.

1864
01:33:20,350 --> 01:33:21,430
Why is that?
Do you think?

1865
01:33:21,431 --> 01:33:23,350
It's because we're aspiring to something
better.

1866
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:26,350
I think it's because people succumb to
wrongly,

1867
01:33:26,351 --> 01:33:28,960
so to the idea of biological
determinism,

1868
01:33:29,350 --> 01:33:33,400
they think that if you.
If you call up and explaining a

1869
01:33:33,401 --> 01:33:35,500
phenomenon,
a biological principle,

1870
01:33:35,620 --> 01:33:37,630
that means you are doing to your
biology.

1871
01:33:38,010 --> 01:33:41,200
It's a fatalistic thing,
which of course is nonsense because

1872
01:33:41,201 --> 01:33:44,380
there's no such thing as biological
determinism because most of the things

1873
01:33:44,740 --> 01:33:48,790
that are triggered by our biology have
to be triggered by interacting with the

1874
01:33:48,791 --> 01:33:49,624
environment.
Right?

1875
01:33:49,630 --> 01:33:54,610
Genes are turned on or off as a function
of environmental inputs and outputs,

1876
01:33:54,850 --> 01:33:59,590
so the idea of biological determinism is
false worry.

1877
01:34:00,010 --> 01:34:02,440
Much of what we do,
it's called the interaction as

1878
01:34:02,441 --> 01:34:05,380
viewpoint.
Much of who we are as an interaction of

1879
01:34:05,381 --> 01:34:10,381
our genes and our environments,
but for most people there is something

1880
01:34:10,810 --> 01:34:15,810
vulgar about reducing the richness of
the human condition to our biology.

1881
01:34:16,450 --> 01:34:21,010
It just feels wrong.
This explains the behavior of the Hyena,

1882
01:34:21,390 --> 01:34:24,280
but we are above that.
We are cultural animals.

1883
01:34:24,370 --> 01:34:27,970
We are prone to conditioning and
socialization and higher order

1884
01:34:27,971 --> 01:34:30,700
cognition.
So you could even take evolutionary

1885
01:34:30,701 --> 01:34:33,760
biologists.
So these are people who are trained in

1886
01:34:33,761 --> 01:34:37,150
evolutionary biology.
They will commit this error.

1887
01:34:37,250 --> 01:34:38,440
I mean that's breathtaking,
right?

1888
01:34:38,700 --> 01:34:42,490
So the classic example is a guy who is
otherwise an utter buffoon.

1889
01:34:42,790 --> 01:34:46,660
His name is Ed Meyers,
a fifth through eighth academic.

1890
01:34:46,661 --> 01:34:49,060
And I say this because not to denigrate
him,

1891
01:34:49,061 --> 01:34:51,780
but by zed.
That's the letter z

1892
01:34:53,330 --> 01:34:57,500
Canadian.
So pz Myers in his claim to fame is he's

1893
01:34:57,501 --> 01:34:59,150
got a very,
and hats off to him.

1894
01:34:59,151 --> 01:35:01,850
He's got an incredibly popular
scientific,

1895
01:35:01,940 --> 01:35:05,370
a blog called fire wrangler,
which you know,

1896
01:35:05,420 --> 01:35:07,970
gets $100,
million views or something.

1897
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:13,190
So he's done very well for himself,
but he's the guy who is perfectly happy

1898
01:35:13,550 --> 01:35:18,320
to use evolutionary principles to
explain the behavior of the mating

1899
01:35:18,321 --> 01:35:18,710
behavior.

1900
01:35:18,710 --> 01:35:21,590
Of the salamander,
but if I come along as an evolutionary

1901
01:35:21,591 --> 01:35:24,260
psychologist and use the exact same
principle,

1902
01:35:24,261 --> 01:35:28,100
the exact same logical structure to
explain human behavior,

1903
01:35:28,300 --> 01:35:30,260
well,
what's this guy doing with this bullshit

1904
01:35:30,261 --> 01:35:33,530
evolutionary psychology stuff that's not
set that pseudo science right,

1905
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:38,270
and the the reflex he has that is
because to somehow explain it for the

1906
01:35:38,271 --> 01:35:40,220
salamander,
make sense?

1907
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:42,590
It's national geographic,
but humans,

1908
01:35:42,890 --> 01:35:45,710
they don't.
They're not prone to biology and I'll

1909
01:35:45,711 --> 01:35:48,890
just give you two other examples.
Stephen Jay Gould,

1910
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:50,570
Richard Lewington,
who were very,

1911
01:35:50,571 --> 01:35:54,970
very famous.
Harvard evolutionists also despised

1912
01:35:54,980 --> 01:35:58,340
evolutionary psychology,
but for other reasons they were avowed

1913
01:35:58,341 --> 01:36:01,160
Marxists.
They came sort of from the hippie

1914
01:36:01,161 --> 01:36:03,500
generation is of the market.
They're probably about 20 years older

1915
01:36:03,501 --> 01:36:03,831
than me.
Well,

1916
01:36:03,831 --> 01:36:05,780
one of the announced passed away,
Stephen Jay Gould is that,

1917
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:10,820
but they were guys who thought that if
evolutionary psychology is right,

1918
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:14,210
then they're Marxists.
Bullshit ideologies would be wrong.

1919
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:17,900
So they were strong anti evolutionary
psychology folks,

1920
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:21,740
even though all of their training
suggested that they should be for it.

1921
01:36:22,010 --> 01:36:23,480
So they are the guys,
by the way,

1922
01:36:23,481 --> 01:36:25,730
who used to Eo Wilson I mentioned
earlier.

1923
01:36:26,090 --> 01:36:29,930
So eo Wilson.
The social ads guy wrote a book called a

1924
01:36:29,970 --> 01:36:34,970
sociobiology in 1975 where he explained
how evolutionary theory could explain

1925
01:36:35,690 --> 01:36:40,610
behavior across all sorts of animals.
Everybody was happy with the book and

1926
01:36:40,611 --> 01:36:44,420
one of the last chapters,
he applies all these principles to the

1927
01:36:44,421 --> 01:36:48,080
human condition.
He became persona non grata.

1928
01:36:48,110 --> 01:36:51,170
He became a Nazi.
He couldn't go anywhere to give a talk

1929
01:36:51,380 --> 01:36:54,520
without being shouted down.
Not unlike how you're seeing Milo today

1930
01:36:54,530 --> 01:36:55,790
being shouted down.
Well,

1931
01:36:55,820 --> 01:37:00,740
Eo Wilson went through those culture
wars 30 years ago because evolutionary

1932
01:37:00,741 --> 01:37:05,420
psychology was attacking the pet
political ideologies of his colleagues

1933
01:37:05,421 --> 01:37:06,070
at Harvard.

1934
01:37:06,070 --> 01:37:07,840
I don't know if Milo's a valid
comparison.

1935
01:37:07,841 --> 01:37:10,230
I think Jordan Peterson better
comparison.

1936
01:37:10,270 --> 01:37:12,280
Fair enough.
Because Milo is obviously a provocateur,

1937
01:37:12,300 --> 01:37:14,850
1 trillion on purpose.
What do you put tea?

1938
01:37:15,190 --> 01:37:17,200
Instead of pointing the finger at
individuals?

1939
01:37:17,201 --> 01:37:21,070
I wouldn't like to try to figure out.
Obviously we're not going to,

1940
01:37:21,100 --> 01:37:22,600
but let's discuss it.
Sure.

1941
01:37:22,630 --> 01:37:25,120
What?
What is the motivation?

1942
01:37:25,660 --> 01:37:30,660
Why do people resist these ideas of
looking at the data of human interaction

1943
01:37:31,421 --> 01:37:36,421
and genetics and sexual preference?
Why do they resist examining these

1944
01:37:37,781 --> 01:37:41,320
factors?
Like what is it about and what is it

1945
01:37:41,321 --> 01:37:44,830
about people that like that guy that
you're talking about that wants to point

1946
01:37:44,831 --> 01:37:49,831
at you for examining these factors and
call you horrific names and just for

1947
01:37:50,231 --> 01:37:55,231
looking at actual provable data data
that you can mean you could show it,

1948
01:37:55,960 --> 01:37:56,140
you

1949
01:37:56,140 --> 01:37:58,170
could do.
It's reviewed.

1950
01:37:58,171 --> 01:37:59,700
You can what?
What is?

1951
01:37:59,850 --> 01:38:03,120
What's the motivation is it's ultimately
ego driven.

1952
01:38:03,150 --> 01:38:08,150
So in the case of those Harvard folks,
they are committed Marxists,

1953
01:38:08,490 --> 01:38:10,590
right?
If evolutionary psychology is right,

1954
01:38:10,890 --> 01:38:13,380
therefore my pet political ideology is
wrong,

1955
01:38:13,410 --> 01:38:15,660
therefore I have to shoot it.
That's one example.

1956
01:38:15,661 --> 01:38:17,670
Let's,
let's do a.

1957
01:38:17,940 --> 01:38:21,790
suppose I am a overweight woman.
Okay,

1958
01:38:22,650 --> 01:38:25,660
and I don't.
I don't get much action on the mating

1959
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:27,870
market.
One of two things can happen.

1960
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:32,910
I could either believe that there is an
evolved preference that men have for

1961
01:38:32,911 --> 01:38:37,911
certain universal standards of beauty.
Or I could go for the much more a

1962
01:38:39,510 --> 01:38:44,460
comforting message,
which is that these beauty standards are

1963
01:38:44,580 --> 01:38:46,590
arbitrary,
sexist,

1964
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:51,600
patriarchal standards,
and if only men would stop being shallow

1965
01:38:51,601 --> 01:38:55,500
and buying into these Hollywood images
than myself,

1966
01:38:55,650 --> 01:39:00,030
this beautiful 800 pound woman would be
getting all the action in the world.

1967
01:39:00,150 --> 01:39:04,710
So it's nothing wrong with me.
It's that there are outside forces that

1968
01:39:04,711 --> 01:39:07,470
are causing these arbitrary preferences
to arise.

1969
01:39:07,471 --> 01:39:11,360
Right?
Naomi Wolf wrote a book and the early

1970
01:39:11,670 --> 01:39:12,960
nineties,
uh,

1971
01:39:13,260 --> 01:39:18,260
the beauty myth that sold millions of
copies where she argued that there is no

1972
01:39:18,511 --> 01:39:20,400
such thing as universal standards of
beauty.

1973
01:39:20,401 --> 01:39:23,400
It's all a beauty myth.
It's the patriarchy that imposes these

1974
01:39:23,401 --> 01:39:26,520
beauty myths on women to attack their
sense of self.

1975
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:29,070
Well,
if I'm a woman who doesn't score well,

1976
01:39:29,370 --> 01:39:30,540
even if I'm,
if I'm a man,

1977
01:39:30,541 --> 01:39:33,750
for example,
and we know that women prefer men of

1978
01:39:33,751 --> 01:39:35,130
high status,
well,

1979
01:39:35,131 --> 01:39:38,370
I could do one of two things.
I could get out there and shake my butt

1980
01:39:38,610 --> 01:39:42,510
and get the status right Joe Rogan.
Nobody gave him all this stuff that you

1981
01:39:42,511 --> 01:39:44,160
have.
You have to work hard for all your

1982
01:39:44,161 --> 01:39:47,520
success so that you could then hopefully
do well on the mating market,

1983
01:39:47,780 --> 01:39:49,500
uh,
or I could say,

1984
01:39:49,501 --> 01:39:51,510
you know what,
these are all arbitrary standards.

1985
01:39:51,510 --> 01:39:52,890
I mean,
and adjust world.

1986
01:39:53,100 --> 01:39:57,570
My being a lazy,
apathetic Beta male would just be as

1987
01:39:57,571 --> 01:40:01,320
worthy of love.
And so I think ultimately there is an

1988
01:40:01,321 --> 01:40:06,321
element to biological based explanations
that's unhopeful to most people,

1989
01:40:07,740 --> 01:40:11,160
right?
The idea that we could all be anything

1990
01:40:11,190 --> 01:40:15,420
is a lot more hopeful and the idea that
we could all be anything unconstrained

1991
01:40:15,421 --> 01:40:19,710
by biology only exists in the recesses
of ideologues.

1992
01:40:20,100 --> 01:40:22,920
The world is not made up like that.
Beautiful.

1993
01:40:22,921 --> 01:40:25,020
People are more symmetric.
Now.

1994
01:40:25,021 --> 01:40:27,060
That doesn't mean that if you're not
symmetric,

1995
01:40:27,420 --> 01:40:30,210
you're doomed to a life of celibacy.
But no,

1996
01:40:30,211 --> 01:40:35,160
the fact that Brad Pitt Brad Pitt is,
is considered handsome because he

1997
01:40:35,161 --> 01:40:39,450
exhibits certain cues that women all
around the world agree are beautiful.

1998
01:40:39,810 --> 01:40:43,770
So to answer your question,
there is something very non hopeful

1999
01:40:44,070 --> 01:40:48,030
about buying.
The idea that we are biological beings.

2000
01:40:48,031 --> 01:40:52,710
It's a lot more comforting to know we
are infinitely malleable and filthy

2001
01:40:52,711 --> 01:40:54,130
social bubble because

2002
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:57,340
then any of us could be anything given
the right conditions.

2003
01:40:57,430 --> 01:41:01,090
I could be the next lionelle messy
that's hopeful and therefore I'd like to

2004
01:41:01,091 --> 01:41:05,420
subscribe to that.
I think there's absolutely something to

2005
01:41:05,421 --> 01:41:09,100
what you're saying,
but I think there's also this very

2006
01:41:09,101 --> 01:41:13,720
strange and vague possibility that we
are aspiring to a higher standard

2007
01:41:13,721 --> 01:41:18,190
because we recognize that human beings
are evolving and that we're moving into

2008
01:41:18,191 --> 01:41:21,940
some strange place where we're.
We're no longer just creatures of flesh

2009
01:41:22,390 --> 01:41:25,930
and that this need to put people on
this.

2010
01:41:25,931 --> 01:41:30,700
Even playing field is.
This is a part of this aspiration.

2011
01:41:30,900 --> 01:41:34,480
I definitely think there's these
influences and I definitely think there

2012
01:41:34,481 --> 01:41:38,620
are these.
There's a lot of people that look at

2013
01:41:38,890 --> 01:41:41,320
beautiful people and they get upset.
I mean there's a.

2014
01:41:41,321 --> 01:41:45,490
there's a way that they do it where they
feel that they're justified in being

2015
01:41:45,491 --> 01:41:48,790
prejudice.
Like they can see a guy like the rock

2016
01:41:48,820 --> 01:41:51,100
for example,
who's as big,

2017
01:41:51,101 --> 01:41:54,970
handsome man as big burly man and they
think that guy's a fucking idiot.

2018
01:41:55,420 --> 01:41:57,730
Immediately me and while that guy
probably reads a lot,

2019
01:41:57,760 --> 01:41:59,080
he's probably smart as hell,
right,

2020
01:41:59,081 --> 01:42:01,870
and he's obviously very ambitious so he
can control his mind.

2021
01:42:01,900 --> 01:42:03,790
Charismatic,
he's very disciplined.

2022
01:42:04,060 --> 01:42:07,840
He controls his mind far better than a
lot of overweight people that would

2023
01:42:07,841 --> 01:42:12,841
criticize him and call him a fool,
but meanwhile they let their body rot to

2024
01:42:13,181 --> 01:42:16,240
the state of decay,
which is not an intellectual thing to do

2025
01:42:16,241 --> 01:42:20,800
if you're looking at your body and like
a as a finite resource and how do you

2026
01:42:20,801 --> 01:42:22,170
manage that resource?
Well,

2027
01:42:22,171 --> 01:42:23,950
very poorly for eating,
ring dings,

2028
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:27,220
drinking fucking soda and smoking
cigarettes and then talking about the

2029
01:42:27,221 --> 01:42:28,810
rock being an idiot.
Right?

2030
01:42:28,980 --> 01:42:30,640
I mean that's.
These are obviously strom and

2031
01:42:30,641 --> 01:42:35,641
exemptions,
but I wonder if what we're doing with

2032
01:42:36,130 --> 01:42:41,130
what's going on in Canada and this,
this liberal social justice warrior

2033
01:42:42,580 --> 01:42:46,180
approach to everybody being equal and if
they're not,

2034
01:42:46,181 --> 01:42:49,750
let's try to make them equal and if
there's anybody that's superior to try

2035
01:42:49,751 --> 01:42:54,250
to push them down and bring the Brown
people up and I wonder if we're trying

2036
01:42:54,251 --> 01:42:58,000
to achieve some sort of equilibrium,
some sort of balance,

2037
01:42:58,001 --> 01:43:02,350
some sort of,
some sort of state where we're no longer

2038
01:43:02,351 --> 01:43:05,830
just monkeys were no longer just
creatures of,

2039
01:43:05,860 --> 01:43:07,420
you know,
I want to fuck her because she's got big

2040
01:43:07,421 --> 01:43:08,140
tits.

2041
01:43:08,140 --> 01:43:12,880
These are base ideas.
These are base instincts that it's fine

2042
01:43:12,881 --> 01:43:17,470
if we observe them in Benobos,
but we don't want to see them in Harvard

2043
01:43:17,471 --> 01:43:19,540
educated kids.
Right?

2044
01:43:19,541 --> 01:43:22,750
So the male gaze becomes problematic,
right?

2045
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:26,200
A man staring at a woman becomes a
microaggression.

2046
01:43:26,290 --> 01:43:28,210
Meanwhile,
she's wearing almost nothing.

2047
01:43:28,570 --> 01:43:32,110
She's got a short skirt on and painted
toes and you want to look.

2048
01:43:32,380 --> 01:43:34,450
You can't help yourself.
The jeans come firing up.

2049
01:43:34,630 --> 01:43:38,890
You must suppress those because we were
eventually moving past the flesh and you

2050
01:43:38,891 --> 01:43:41,890
are of the new generation.
The new generation that will someday be

2051
01:43:41,891 --> 01:43:46,891
neutered and there'll be some non binary
expression of your humanity that exists

2052
01:43:47,981 --> 01:43:52,370
as an Avatar and some virtual reality
world that you'll be forced to subscribe

2053
01:43:52,370 --> 01:43:54,170
to when you,
when you joined Yale,

2054
01:43:54,590 --> 01:43:56,510
but by the way,
that's when you talk about the male

2055
01:43:56,511 --> 01:43:58,430
gaze.
I'm not sure if we've discussed this on

2056
01:43:58,431 --> 01:44:02,480
this show before,
but it's precisely this type of thinking

2057
01:44:02,481 --> 01:44:07,481
that causes the western feminists to
view the Burka is liberating and the

2058
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:12,420
bikini as a patriarchal oppression.
It's.

2059
01:44:12,450 --> 01:44:13,520
It's exactly that,
right?

2060
01:44:13,850 --> 01:44:17,930
The to the extent that the male gaze as
a form of visual rape,

2061
01:44:18,770 --> 01:44:21,290
right,
and that should be condemned.

2062
01:44:21,291 --> 01:44:25,100
That should be stopped because it is a
type of assault in quotes,

2063
01:44:25,190 --> 01:44:26,660
right?
The Burka.

2064
01:44:26,720 --> 01:44:29,540
By removing that male gaze becomes
liberating.

2065
01:44:29,541 --> 01:44:31,010
Now,
this is not an argument that I'm making

2066
01:44:31,011 --> 01:44:31,730
up.
This is,

2067
01:44:31,730 --> 01:44:34,160
I've heard this argument.
On the other hand,

2068
01:44:34,161 --> 01:44:39,161
when a woman wears the Brazilian a Thong
and you and I look at her and have the

2069
01:44:39,171 --> 01:44:44,171
exact same predictable response that
most men would have because it's an

2070
01:44:44,451 --> 01:44:45,380
evolved response.

2071
01:44:45,620 --> 01:44:46,453
Well,
that's,

2072
01:44:46,870 --> 01:44:50,450
that's bad because we are part of the
Patriarchy and we are succumbing to this

2073
01:44:50,690 --> 01:44:51,650
rape urge,
right?

2074
01:44:51,950 --> 01:44:55,370
So this is so when I talk about ostrich
parasitic syndrome,

2075
01:44:55,580 --> 01:44:59,180
I don't just use it as a metaphor,
it's genuinely the case that people's

2076
01:44:59,181 --> 01:45:04,100
minds are becoming infected with such
garbage that they're incapable to

2077
01:45:04,350 --> 01:45:06,650
rationalize,
to think would reason.

2078
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:08,840
And that's what I ended up doing most of
the time.

2079
01:45:08,841 --> 01:45:10,880
That's what Jordan Peterson ends up
doing most of the time,

2080
01:45:10,881 --> 01:45:14,990
which is we are committed to truth
unencumbered by political correctness.

2081
01:45:14,991 --> 01:45:17,060
Earlier you were saying,
what would be some,

2082
01:45:17,420 --> 01:45:19,730
you know,
how can we get ourselves out of

2083
01:45:20,150 --> 01:45:24,050
succumbing to this tribalism and so on.
I think the only way you could do it,

2084
01:45:24,110 --> 01:45:26,360
and I'm not saying that anybody can
reach that level,

2085
01:45:26,630 --> 01:45:29,930
is to simply be dedicated to the pursuit
of truth.

2086
01:45:30,830 --> 01:45:33,060
When I was on Sam Harris Show,
uh,

2087
01:45:33,410 --> 01:45:34,730
you know,
earlier this year,

2088
01:45:34,940 --> 01:45:36,080
about six,
seven months ago,

2089
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:37,700
he asked me,
is there any,

2090
01:45:38,180 --> 01:45:42,200
a research question that you would not
tackle in your,

2091
01:45:42,660 --> 01:45:45,140
in your,
in your scientific career that is too

2092
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:46,010
taboo?

2093
01:45:46,010 --> 01:45:47,750
And my answer was no.
Right?

2094
01:45:48,110 --> 01:45:53,090
As long as you address the question
honestly and objectively,

2095
01:45:53,750 --> 01:45:55,640
there is nothing that should be off
limits,

2096
01:45:55,641 --> 01:45:56,990
right?
Because then it becomes very easy to

2097
01:45:56,991 --> 01:45:57,291
say,
well,

2098
01:45:57,291 --> 01:45:59,480
sex differences,
we shouldn't study that because then it

2099
01:45:59,481 --> 01:46:02,360
will marginalize one sex or the other
race differences.

2100
01:46:02,361 --> 01:46:04,370
We shouldn't study them for the same
reason.

2101
01:46:04,371 --> 01:46:06,410
So on.
That becomes forbidden knowledge.

2102
01:46:06,470 --> 01:46:10,310
No,
the highest ideal that any honest person

2103
01:46:10,311 --> 01:46:13,670
should pursue is the pursuit of truth
and certainly an intellectual.

2104
01:46:14,120 --> 01:46:16,370
So No,
don't be encumbered by political

2105
01:46:16,371 --> 01:46:18,230
correctness.
Just pursue the truth.

2106
01:46:18,231 --> 01:46:22,190
And I think one of the reasons for that
Jordan Peterson's message and my message

2107
01:46:22,191 --> 01:46:25,940
has resonated now with a lot of people
is because at least they see that we are

2108
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:29,540
ascribing to that ideal to the best of
our abilities.

2109
01:46:29,750 --> 01:46:33,420
What if that truth hurts your feelings?
Fuck you're feeling.

2110
01:46:33,500 --> 01:46:36,620
Oh,
I'm triggered.

2111
01:46:37,540 --> 01:46:42,530
I believe I used the f word was this
podcast.

2112
01:46:42,531 --> 01:46:43,870
I was an effect on people.
Yeah,

2113
01:46:44,360 --> 01:46:45,700
I think it's,
um,

2114
01:46:45,950 --> 01:46:48,470
you know,
it's a bunch of different things going

2115
01:46:48,471 --> 01:46:50,070
on all at once and

2116
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:55,520
there's obviously some tribalism going
on even amongst these social justice

2117
01:46:56,401 --> 01:46:58,860
warriors.
He's a virtue signaling people who are

2118
01:46:58,890 --> 01:47:03,890
trying to get as much credit as much
social justice warrior street credit as

2119
01:47:05,701 --> 01:47:08,370
they can,
like what happened with Bret Weinstein

2120
01:47:08,371 --> 01:47:11,130
up in Evergreen college and when I had
him on,

2121
01:47:11,131 --> 01:47:16,131
I just read some recent thing where
they're doubling down on their hate of

2122
01:47:16,681 --> 01:47:18,740
him and you know,
they,

2123
01:47:19,300 --> 01:47:22,770
they're,
they're accusing him of all of this by

2124
01:47:22,771 --> 01:47:25,920
simply going on the Tucker Carlson show.
Now,

2125
01:47:25,921 --> 01:47:28,590
here's what's fascinating.
Huffington post,

2126
01:47:28,860 --> 01:47:32,850
which is a really left leaning
establishment,

2127
01:47:32,851 --> 01:47:35,640
right?
I mean if any website is left leaning,

2128
01:47:35,641 --> 01:47:37,980
it's Huffington Post.
I mean I think they have some great

2129
01:47:37,981 --> 01:47:39,060
articles.
Don't get me wrong.

2130
01:47:39,061 --> 01:47:41,160
It's not like I'm not critical of all
their stuff,

2131
01:47:41,161 --> 01:47:44,160
but it's very left leaning,
like openly regard.

2132
01:47:44,640 --> 01:47:49,640
They had a piece breaking down how
preposterous these students are and the

2133
01:47:50,761 --> 01:47:55,710
faculty and the president and what they
have done to Bret Weinstein and

2134
01:47:55,711 --> 01:48:00,711
criticized each step of it by showing a
transcription of his conversation on the

2135
01:48:04,290 --> 01:48:07,050
Tucker Carlson show,
which lasted like five minutes I think.

2136
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:10,230
And you know,
they called Tucker Carlson alt right.

2137
01:48:11,190 --> 01:48:12,000
Okay.
I don't know.

2138
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,040
You redefining outright now,
by the way,

2139
01:48:14,041 --> 01:48:15,090
I've been called.
All right.

2140
01:48:15,120 --> 01:48:18,600
Dave Rubin and I are leaders of the
ultra.

2141
01:48:18,660 --> 01:48:20,490
That's amazing.
We're leaders.

2142
01:48:20,491 --> 01:48:23,220
We the actual leaders of the alt right.
I wrote a tweet about this,

2143
01:48:23,221 --> 01:48:26,250
like the fact that they can call Dave
Rubin,

2144
01:48:26,490 --> 01:48:31,490
who is a gay man who's married to a man
who used to be on the young Turks who's

2145
01:48:32,280 --> 01:48:34,260
Jewish,
who is Jewish and I mean I guess I

2146
01:48:34,261 --> 01:48:37,680
called him a progressive,
but it progressive in the idea that he,

2147
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:41,880
he wants progress.
I mean the real broad term of

2148
01:48:41,881 --> 01:48:45,840
progressive progress,
meaning equality for all but honest,

2149
01:48:45,990 --> 01:48:48,990
honest about the approach,
but I would consider him probably more

2150
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:52,200
of a libertarian bent if you wanted to
get like political,

2151
01:48:52,620 --> 01:48:57,480
which I guess I'm sort of in this sort
of progressive slash libertarian left

2152
01:48:57,481 --> 01:49:00,660
leaning thing,
but I also believe in a lot of right

2153
01:49:00,780 --> 01:49:01,770
things as well.

2154
01:49:01,770 --> 01:49:02,603
Like,
you know,

2155
01:49:02,610 --> 01:49:05,130
the.
I think that competition is probably

2156
01:49:05,131 --> 01:49:06,510
ultimately good.
Right?

2157
01:49:06,630 --> 01:49:11,630
And I think that blaming other people
for your lack of success is really easy

2158
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:13,830
and it's something that people do all
the time.

2159
01:49:13,831 --> 01:49:16,170
But when you do that,
if you look at things in that way,

2160
01:49:16,410 --> 01:49:21,410
then you're diminishing the struggles
that downtrodden people and minorities

2161
01:49:22,411 --> 01:49:24,860
and the oppressed and all these
different,

2162
01:49:24,861 --> 01:49:25,694
uh,
you know,

2163
01:49:26,310 --> 01:49:30,420
small groups that have been somehow
another marginalized there.

2164
01:49:30,421 --> 01:49:33,480
You're diminishing their struggle,
which is absolutely not the case.

2165
01:49:33,810 --> 01:49:38,280
But there have been people that have
emerged from those groups and done

2166
01:49:38,281 --> 01:49:40,140
amazing things.
But Oh,

2167
01:49:40,141 --> 01:49:43,650
those are outliers and you can't hold
people up to the standards of those

2168
01:49:43,680 --> 01:49:45,360
outliers.
And you know,

2169
01:49:45,361 --> 01:49:48,310
the real problem is that the is stacked

2170
01:49:48,310 --> 01:49:51,880
in the favor of these white men who
experienced white privilege.

2171
01:49:51,881 --> 01:49:55,120
And what we really need to do is squash
white men.

2172
01:49:56,410 --> 01:49:57,040
By the way,
I have,

2173
01:49:57,040 --> 01:50:00,190
I have a theory about all this stuff.
Well,

2174
01:50:00,230 --> 01:50:03,430
this.
So I called it collective Munchhausen.

2175
01:50:03,640 --> 01:50:04,870
Oh,
you've said this before.

2176
01:50:05,460 --> 01:50:06,700
Please go.
Go again though.

2177
01:50:07,060 --> 01:50:09,120
I'd like this to stand alone.
Thank you.

2178
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:13,990
So remember how earlier I said that the
highest ideal should be the pursuit of

2179
01:50:13,991 --> 01:50:14,680
the truth.
Yeah.

2180
01:50:14,680 --> 01:50:18,250
So the currency that I operate in is
pursuing truth.

2181
01:50:18,280 --> 01:50:21,250
Wherever that leads me a banker cares
about the bottom line.

2182
01:50:21,251 --> 01:50:23,320
How much money,
how many Zeros there are in his bank,

2183
01:50:23,321 --> 01:50:24,460
right?
And my case.

2184
01:50:24,461 --> 01:50:27,910
It's truth.
Now in the social justice warriors

2185
01:50:28,300 --> 01:50:33,300
currency,
it's how much eagle strokes he or she

2186
01:50:33,521 --> 01:50:37,150
gets by proclaiming unique victimhood
status.

2187
01:50:37,180 --> 01:50:38,740
Now,
why do I call this collective

2188
01:50:38,741 --> 01:50:40,630
Munchhausen?
So in 2010,

2189
01:50:40,631 --> 01:50:45,310
I had published a paper in a medical
journal where I was looking at a

2190
01:50:45,311 --> 01:50:49,720
specific form of Munchhausen Syndrome as
a psychiatric condition where someone

2191
01:50:49,960 --> 01:50:53,200
feigns illness to get attention,
to get empathy,

2192
01:50:53,201 --> 01:50:54,034
to get sympathy.

2193
01:50:54,130 --> 01:50:56,860
It's a real psychiatric condition.
I know a lady who's got it.

2194
01:50:57,040 --> 01:50:57,980
Is that right?
Oh yeah.

2195
01:50:58,820 --> 01:50:59,680
Okay.
Uh,

2196
01:50:59,730 --> 01:51:04,730
I later I will write a Munchausen
Syndrome by proxy is a different

2197
01:51:08,440 --> 01:51:13,440
situation where you try to get your ego
stroked by harming someone else and then

2198
01:51:16,691 --> 01:51:18,400
getting the rewards.
So what does that mean?

2199
01:51:18,730 --> 01:51:19,600
You are,
for example,

2200
01:51:19,601 --> 01:51:22,810
at biological mother who,
who has this condition,

2201
01:51:23,050 --> 01:51:26,530
you will harm your child,
your biological child,

2202
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:29,350
so that then you could take him to the
hospital and people say,

2203
01:51:29,351 --> 01:51:30,131
Oh,
poor you,

2204
01:51:30,131 --> 01:51:35,131
you've got a sick alien child and so on.
And then you get your your or orgiastic

2205
01:51:35,321 --> 01:51:39,460
orgasmic strokes by getting that
attention and that empathy,

2206
01:51:39,461 --> 01:51:42,190
right?
Or You could do it if you have a pet or

2207
01:51:42,191 --> 01:51:45,370
sometimes with elderly parents,
but usually it's your biological child.

2208
01:51:45,610 --> 01:51:48,190
So I was writing a paper trying to
explain this from an evolutionary

2209
01:51:48,191 --> 01:51:50,260
perspective,
how this pathology could arise,

2210
01:51:50,590 --> 01:51:54,550
and so that's how the psychiatric
syndrome wasn't in my radar.

2211
01:51:54,820 --> 01:51:59,680
And then as I started seeing all these
social justice warriors navigating the

2212
01:51:59,681 --> 01:52:02,260
world through a game of oppression,
Olympics,

2213
01:52:02,270 --> 01:52:07,270
where the highest goal you can achieve
is to be declared the winner of the

2214
01:52:07,780 --> 01:52:09,730
oppression Olympics game,
right?

2215
01:52:09,731 --> 01:52:12,760
It's not the pursuit of truth.
It's not making the most money.

2216
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:16,450
It's can I be anointed as the guy with
the greatest.

2217
01:52:16,510 --> 01:52:20,500
And I call this collective Munchhausen
because it becomes a form of

2218
01:52:20,920 --> 01:52:22,810
Munchhausen,
but at the collective level.

2219
01:52:22,811 --> 01:52:24,990
Right?
Let me give you another example as

2220
01:52:24,991 --> 01:52:29,380
voting for Donald Trump.
When Donald Trump won the election,

2221
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:33,160
just on my facebook page,
private personal facebook page,

2222
01:52:33,460 --> 01:52:38,460
I would see people outdoing each other
almost as if it were satirical in terms

2223
01:52:39,641 --> 01:52:43,810
of their collective Munchausen.
I am a brown woman who was attending

2224
01:52:43,811 --> 01:52:46,340
this university now that Donald Trump

2225
01:52:46,340 --> 01:52:49,160
has won.
I'm afraid to go to classes.

2226
01:52:49,670 --> 01:52:51,950
I mean,
just think about how outrageous that

2227
01:52:51,951 --> 01:52:54,500
sounds.
I mean you may like or dislike Donald

2228
01:52:54,500 --> 01:52:57,050
Trump.
Do you genuinely believe that your

2229
01:52:57,051 --> 01:53:01,630
ability to take classes and your
bullshit college and main is going to be

2230
01:53:01,631 --> 01:53:04,430
affected?
You're going to experience personal

2231
01:53:04,431 --> 01:53:09,010
safety because Donald Trump is setting
up roadblocks so that he could create

2232
01:53:09,050 --> 01:53:12,470
internment camps for all women of color
so that they get gang raped.

2233
01:53:12,710 --> 01:53:15,920
What is the fear that you have that you
are literally right,

2234
01:53:15,950 --> 01:53:20,120
but they're testifying they're
testifying to and so it becomes this

2235
01:53:20,480 --> 01:53:25,480
collective psychosis where the way that
I win is by demonstrating that I am the

2236
01:53:26,991 --> 01:53:29,510
biggest victim,
and so that's what social justice

2237
01:53:29,511 --> 01:53:32,480
warriors do,
is that they have to win that game.

2238
01:53:32,660 --> 01:53:37,340
And so there is no.
So the Bret Weinstein example is those

2239
01:53:37,341 --> 01:53:41,660
guys seeking to win those Olympics.
How dare you say that?

2240
01:53:41,661 --> 01:53:44,570
You could come on campus.
Don't you know what kinds of victims we

2241
01:53:44,571 --> 01:53:45,650
are and so on.
It's,

2242
01:53:45,670 --> 01:53:48,020
it's a,
it's a complete departure from reason.

2243
01:53:48,021 --> 01:53:49,970
It's grotesque.
It's a psychiatric condition,

2244
01:53:50,640 --> 01:53:52,190
it's,
it's weird

2245
01:53:52,430 --> 01:53:53,750
prevalent.
It is though,

2246
01:53:53,840 --> 01:53:58,840
and how it's almost one of those things
that you as a professor are not really

2247
01:53:58,971 --> 01:54:03,080
allowed to discuss with the people that
are exhibiting that behavior because

2248
01:54:03,081 --> 01:54:05,520
then you're diminishing their fear,
right?

2249
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:09,050
You're diminishing or marginalizing
their,

2250
01:54:09,080 --> 01:54:12,350
their own personal issues that they feel
that they have.

2251
01:54:12,590 --> 01:54:17,590
Except except because I always can pull
out my victimology card which usually

2252
01:54:19,971 --> 01:54:24,860
outranks all of them because they're
screaming while sitting at Wellesley

2253
01:54:24,890 --> 01:54:27,950
paying $60,000 that they are
marginalized.

2254
01:54:28,250 --> 01:54:32,240
Whereas I say I'm not sure if I can be
sympathetic because let me tell you my

2255
01:54:32,241 --> 01:54:33,580
personal history.
Well that's what,

2256
01:54:33,590 --> 01:54:33,730
yeah.

2257
01:54:33,730 --> 01:54:37,680
Did with that guy and I'm in the meeting
when he accused you of genocide.

2258
01:54:37,720 --> 01:54:39,370
He's not.
You've hit them with braces.

2259
01:54:39,400 --> 01:54:41,050
Exactly.
Like suck it stupid.

2260
01:54:41,080 --> 01:54:42,580
Exactly.
And so now

2261
01:54:42,670 --> 01:54:43,503
by the way,
sit.

2262
01:54:43,630 --> 01:54:46,360
The only way I could improve my score as
I have jokingly said,

2263
01:54:46,810 --> 01:54:49,580
is if I self identify as a woman,

2264
01:54:50,270 --> 01:54:52,470
I'm transgendered.
Would you shave though?

2265
01:54:53,010 --> 01:54:56,220
If you self identified as a woman,
why do you have to assume the appearance

2266
01:54:56,221 --> 01:54:57,300
of a woman?
I mean,

2267
01:54:57,301 --> 01:54:59,580
if really appearances don't matter.
Exactly.

2268
01:54:59,610 --> 01:55:01,640
I mean if,
if a woman with a penis.

2269
01:55:01,740 --> 01:55:03,750
Well yeah,
I mean this whole idea that beauty

2270
01:55:03,751 --> 01:55:07,290
standards are bullshit and that are
constructed by the patriarchy.

2271
01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:09,120
Why can't you grow a big old Santa
Claus?

2272
01:55:09,121 --> 01:55:11,040
Beard steel.
Still identify with a woman.

2273
01:55:11,300 --> 01:55:12,260
I'm,
I'm with you.

2274
01:55:12,380 --> 01:55:14,190
Why can't you?
Well,

2275
01:55:14,191 --> 01:55:15,330
let's,
let's set the trend.

2276
01:55:15,390 --> 01:55:18,420
But where do we draw the line though?
Because I have no problem with someone

2277
01:55:18,421 --> 01:55:20,310
identifying as a woman.
If you want to be a woman,

2278
01:55:20,311 --> 01:55:22,410
that's fine.
I don't care.

2279
01:55:22,650 --> 01:55:23,251
But.
Well,

2280
01:55:23,251 --> 01:55:24,960
where.
Where do we draw the line though?

2281
01:55:24,990 --> 01:55:27,510
Where are you allowed?
Where are you?

2282
01:55:27,570 --> 01:55:30,660
How,
how out there can you get before I'm

2283
01:55:30,661 --> 01:55:31,351
allowed to go.
Well,

2284
01:55:31,351 --> 01:55:32,790
that guy might be fucking crazy.

2285
01:55:33,010 --> 01:55:34,900
Have you heard about this new?
There's this new,

2286
01:55:34,901 --> 01:55:39,901
I think called I think cis sexism.
Have you heard this?

2287
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,670
No,
I think I covered it in one of my sad

2288
01:55:42,671 --> 01:55:43,950
truth.
It's

2289
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:47,550
basically the idea that,
so you,

2290
01:55:47,600 --> 01:55:49,630
you,
you're a heterosexual male and CIS

2291
01:55:49,631 --> 01:55:50,830
gendered,
right?

2292
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:53,400
Which is not real.
That's not a real expression,

2293
01:55:53,401 --> 01:55:55,410
but it is real.
But we'll all expressions are created by

2294
01:55:55,411 --> 01:55:56,071
humans,
right?

2295
01:55:56,071 --> 01:55:57,720
So very true.
Some humans,

2296
01:55:57,750 --> 01:56:02,190
except so you and I wish to mate with
women,

2297
01:56:02,430 --> 01:56:04,320
hence we are heterosexual.
Do we?

2298
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:05,910
Okay.
Right now,

2299
01:56:07,080 --> 01:56:12,080
stay with me now at by you restricting
your preference to this old antiquated

2300
01:56:17,730 --> 01:56:20,730
term of women,
meaning that they have vaginas.

2301
01:56:21,060 --> 01:56:23,610
You're actually engaging in a form of
CIS,

2302
01:56:23,640 --> 01:56:28,640
CIS sexism because there are women who
have nine inch penises who should also

2303
01:56:30,421 --> 01:56:34,530
be privy to your attention.
So by you saying,

2304
01:56:34,590 --> 01:56:36,780
yes,
I'm attracted to women,

2305
01:56:37,290 --> 01:56:39,780
but only the women that are cis
gendered,

2306
01:56:39,781 --> 01:56:43,680
that have female genitalia,
that's a form of CIS sexism.

2307
01:56:44,070 --> 01:56:48,510
This idea is not being promulgated.
So you even saying that you have a

2308
01:56:48,511 --> 01:56:53,511
heterosexual orientation towards
biological women as a form of

2309
01:56:53,671 --> 01:56:55,800
Transphobia,
not unlike by the way.

2310
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:58,200
Here's another example of racialism.
Have you heard of this?

2311
01:56:58,201 --> 01:56:59,490
I said yes.
Okay.

2312
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:01,650
I love this idea.
Isn't it fantastic?

2313
01:57:01,800 --> 01:57:05,880
It's wonderful.
So how far can we take this?

2314
01:57:05,881 --> 01:57:07,800
Like how we far?
Okay.

2315
01:57:07,820 --> 01:57:10,740
So you think that you think the fulcrum
is not going to start swinging the other

2316
01:57:10,741 --> 01:57:12,750
way at some point?
For sure it will.

2317
01:57:12,751 --> 01:57:14,400
And it has,
and I think that's one of the reasons

2318
01:57:14,401 --> 01:57:17,400
why Donald Trump got into office,
is people are so upset with political

2319
01:57:17,401 --> 01:57:19,740
correctness,
they went with the exact opposite,

2320
01:57:19,741 --> 01:57:24,741
which is buffoonery outrageous
braggadocious male buffoonery.

2321
01:57:25,990 --> 01:57:27,300
I mean,
that's really what it is.

2322
01:57:27,330 --> 01:57:30,180
I mean,
he's a braggadocious buffoon and in a

2323
01:57:30,181 --> 01:57:33,060
lot of respects,
especially the way he talks about his

2324
01:57:33,061 --> 01:57:37,410
ratings and ones talks about himself in
the third person,

2325
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:39,780
you know,
like he was describing Kanye west and

2326
01:57:39,781 --> 01:57:42,840
Kanye loves trump mean,
could you imagine saying that about

2327
01:57:42,841 --> 01:57:46,170
yourself and describing yourself in
third person,

2328
01:57:46,171 --> 01:57:47,850
but a famous person loving you.

2329
01:57:47,940 --> 01:57:49,400
Right?
It's so bizarre.

2330
01:57:49,610 --> 01:57:53,190
You know,
a lot of people who follow me think that

2331
01:57:53,300 --> 01:57:56,880
I joked that,
that they think that I have these trump

2332
01:57:56,881 --> 01:57:59,970
posters in my room and you know,
he's my big hero,

2333
01:58:00,330 --> 01:58:01,740
which of course he's not.
And by the way,

2334
01:58:01,741 --> 01:58:03,750
I'm Canadian,
so I truly don't have a dog in this

2335
01:58:03,751 --> 01:58:06,240
fight.
The reason why they think that is

2336
01:58:06,241 --> 01:58:10,650
because I offered prior to the election
being done,

2337
01:58:10,770 --> 01:58:15,770
I offered some compelling reasons,
psychological reasons why people might

2338
01:58:16,351 --> 01:58:18,330
vote for Donald Trump.
So most famously,

2339
01:58:18,331 --> 01:58:23,331
perhaps in my chat with Sam Harris,
I explained the psychological mechanisms

2340
01:58:23,851 --> 01:58:27,840
that could lead to otherwise perfectly
reasonable people to vote for trump,

2341
01:58:28,230 --> 01:58:33,230
simply proposing these was complete
unacceptable.

2342
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:38,010
I'm sure you're aware of what's going on
with Scott Adams and Scott Adams is lost

2343
01:58:38,011 --> 01:58:42,070
millions of dollars for simply stating
that he believes that Donald trump

2344
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:46,110
is a very persuasive person and
correctly predicting that that power of

2345
01:58:46,120 --> 01:58:48,340
persuasion would allow him to win the
presidency.

2346
01:58:48,950 --> 01:58:50,860
He doesn't even vote.
Scott Adams says,

2347
01:58:50,861 --> 01:58:52,720
because he talked so much about
politics,

2348
01:58:52,721 --> 01:58:54,250
he does not want to have a dog in the
fight,

2349
01:58:54,251 --> 01:58:57,190
so he doesn't vote.
He told me that on the podcast.

2350
01:58:57,640 --> 01:58:59,410
And so people think that he's a trump
supporter.

2351
01:58:59,411 --> 01:59:01,120
He's like,
I'm absolutely not a trump supporter.

2352
01:59:01,121 --> 01:59:03,070
He goes,
I'm analyzing the human beings.

2353
01:59:03,330 --> 01:59:05,010
Exactly.
And so here's.

2354
01:59:05,160 --> 01:59:07,620
So just to kind of repeat what I told
Sam.

2355
01:59:08,160 --> 01:59:11,820
So they are different decision rules
that one can use when they're making a

2356
01:59:11,821 --> 01:59:13,420
choice between different competing
alternative.

2357
01:59:13,421 --> 01:59:15,150
So for example,
if you're choosing between cars,

2358
01:59:15,870 --> 01:59:17,820
each car is defined by many attributes,
right?

2359
01:59:17,821 --> 01:59:21,030
It's gas efficiency,
it's the power of its engine.

2360
01:59:21,031 --> 01:59:24,910
It's price and so on and so there are
different ways that I could apply a

2361
01:59:24,920 --> 01:59:27,100
decision rule and choosing between car
a,

2362
01:59:27,120 --> 01:59:29,730
car b,
so here's one rule I could look at,

2363
01:59:29,820 --> 01:59:31,680
take all the attributes,
put them together,

2364
01:59:31,950 --> 01:59:34,350
multiply them by the importance weight
of each attribute,

2365
01:59:34,380 --> 01:59:37,830
and pick the best product,
so using that decision rule,

2366
01:59:38,040 --> 01:59:41,070
maybe Hillary Clinton would have won
because maybe if you put all the

2367
01:59:41,071 --> 01:59:44,370
attributes together,
she ends up scoring higher than Donald

2368
01:59:44,370 --> 01:59:46,110
Trump,
but here's another the decision rule.

2369
01:59:46,140 --> 01:59:49,590
It's called the lexical graphic rule.
Lexical graphical rule basically says,

2370
01:59:49,950 --> 01:59:52,560
I simply look at my most important
attribute.

2371
01:59:53,010 --> 01:59:56,820
What's the attribute that I care most
when I'm making the choice within this

2372
01:59:56,940 --> 01:59:59,970
category,
and I simply choose the alternative that

2373
01:59:59,971 --> 02:00:02,280
scores higher on that most important
attribute.

2374
02:00:02,460 --> 02:00:05,100
So for example,
if it were a cars,

2375
02:00:05,370 --> 02:00:07,380
I only care about the power of the
engine,

2376
02:00:07,620 --> 02:00:10,440
so I choose car a because it has a
stronger power engine,

2377
02:00:10,470 --> 02:00:12,840
right?
And the case of Donald Trump versus

2378
02:00:12,841 --> 02:00:16,440
Hillary Clinton.
Suppose that my lexical graphic rule is

2379
02:00:16,830 --> 02:00:19,980
I care only about the position on
immigration.

2380
02:00:20,490 --> 02:00:23,310
That's my decision.
That's the only thing I look at.

2381
02:00:23,880 --> 02:00:25,710
Well,
it's very reasonable for people to think

2382
02:00:25,711 --> 02:00:30,711
that Donald trump had a more
conservative view on immigration than

2383
02:00:31,201 --> 02:00:34,020
Hillary Clinton.
So if I use that decision rule,

2384
02:00:34,080 --> 02:00:36,900
that psychological rule,
I would choose Donald Trump.

2385
02:00:37,140 --> 02:00:40,930
It wouldn't make me a guy who is
sleeping with my sister and I'm a tooth

2386
02:00:41,110 --> 02:00:43,500
tooth toothless sky and Arkansas and a
hick.

2387
02:00:43,770 --> 02:00:47,850
It simply means that I'm using a
particular decision rule that causes me

2388
02:00:47,851 --> 02:00:49,770
to choose Donald Trump over Hillary
Clinton.

2389
02:00:49,950 --> 02:00:51,420
So again,
all I did,

2390
02:00:51,780 --> 02:00:54,090
not unlike what Scott Adams did his own
way,

2391
02:00:54,360 --> 02:00:58,890
his offer,
the different psychological processes by

2392
02:00:58,891 --> 02:01:02,970
which a very reasonable person can end
up choosing Donald trump rather than

2393
02:01:02,971 --> 02:01:05,640
Hillary Clinton.
And it's unbelievable.

2394
02:01:05,641 --> 02:01:07,530
The kind of flack I got.
It was crazy because it's,

2395
02:01:07,531 --> 02:01:07,700
it's

2396
02:01:07,700 --> 02:01:10,110
your absolute area of expertise.
I mean,

2397
02:01:10,130 --> 02:01:12,500
it's what your education is it.
It's what you teach.

2398
02:01:12,501 --> 02:01:15,800
Exactly.
It's so strange that if it doesn't jive

2399
02:01:15,801 --> 02:01:20,120
with people's belief systems,
they get upset at you for teaching

2400
02:01:20,300 --> 02:01:22,220
something that's science.
Right?

2401
02:01:22,400 --> 02:01:23,420
Well,
I call this by the way,

2402
02:01:23,421 --> 02:01:24,260
the,
the.

2403
02:01:24,320 --> 02:01:25,970
I used to love.
You got sad,

2404
02:01:26,180 --> 02:01:29,570
but roof.
So I used to love you got sat,

2405
02:01:29,660 --> 02:01:30,940
but trump,
I hate you,

2406
02:01:30,950 --> 02:01:33,380
but I just love saying that though.
They used to stay,

2407
02:01:33,381 --> 02:01:36,860
love saying that they love to try to
instill a seed of regret.

2408
02:01:36,861 --> 02:01:40,340
Not just criticism but regret because
it's more painful,

2409
02:01:40,490 --> 02:01:42,020
right?
Like to say,

2410
02:01:42,170 --> 02:01:43,880
I just think you're a fool.
It's like,

2411
02:01:43,881 --> 02:01:44,960
all right,
well fuck you.

2412
02:01:44,990 --> 02:01:46,370
You're not my fan.
I'm not into you.

2413
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:51,400
What's the number one source of flack
that you receive from your gigantic fan

2414
02:01:51,521 --> 02:01:53,970
base?
Oh,

2415
02:01:54,320 --> 02:01:58,430
the one issue that triggers the most
animal to you.

2416
02:01:58,880 --> 02:01:59,900
Boy,
I don't know.

2417
02:02:00,020 --> 02:02:02,090
To me like personally,
you know,

2418
02:02:02,120 --> 02:02:03,800
Joel,
I think you're a great guy,

2419
02:02:03,801 --> 02:02:06,500
but my God,
you're such an idiot because of x.

2420
02:02:06,501 --> 02:02:09,310
what's x?
There's so many things we did.

2421
02:02:09,380 --> 02:02:11,600
We did a three hour podcasts just to
name them all.

2422
02:02:11,830 --> 02:02:15,050
I get a lot of facts wrong.
A lot of things I remember incorrectly

2423
02:02:15,080 --> 02:02:17,660
because a lot of these free form
conversations,

2424
02:02:17,661 --> 02:02:20,300
like we're having a.
it's not planned out.

2425
02:02:20,301 --> 02:02:22,310
The subjects aren't planned out in
particular,

2426
02:02:22,311 --> 02:02:26,240
like the divergent paths that we take.
Sometimes we'll go down a path and I'll

2427
02:02:26,241 --> 02:02:29,090
go to that.
What was that story about that thing,

2428
02:02:29,300 --> 02:02:32,530
and I'll get that shit wrong all the
time because there's just,

2429
02:02:32,540 --> 02:02:34,340
I mean,
as good as my memory is and it's pretty

2430
02:02:34,341 --> 02:02:38,000
good,
there's just a certain amount of data

2431
02:02:38,001 --> 02:02:41,840
that you could instantaneously call up
to the.

2432
02:02:41,841 --> 02:02:45,740
I mean if you ask me questions about
certain things that are in my constant

2433
02:02:45,741 --> 02:02:48,560
day to day existence,
like maybe perhaps standup comedy or

2434
02:02:48,561 --> 02:02:49,670
martial arts,
I can,

2435
02:02:50,060 --> 02:02:53,780
I can give you a staggering amount of
information off the top of my head,

2436
02:02:53,990 --> 02:02:56,240
but there's a lot of stuff that,
you know,

2437
02:02:56,470 --> 02:02:58,190
we talk about in these podcasts.

2438
02:02:58,190 --> 02:02:59,570
It's just people say,
well,

2439
02:02:59,571 --> 02:03:00,680
you should have prepared for it.
Well,

2440
02:03:00,681 --> 02:03:02,480
I didn't know we're going to talk about
it because it's no,

2441
02:03:02,650 --> 02:03:05,000
it's one of the things that makes the
conversation so interesting.

2442
02:03:05,240 --> 02:03:08,270
So in that sense I'm giving myself would
get out of jail free pass.

2443
02:03:08,271 --> 02:03:10,860
But um,
I dunno.

2444
02:03:10,970 --> 02:03:12,740
I mean getting things wrong is probably
the big one.

2445
02:03:12,741 --> 02:03:13,790
Okay.
Yeah.

2446
02:03:14,210 --> 02:03:15,860
Talking over people,
being a meathead,

2447
02:03:16,150 --> 02:03:19,850
all those things I'm guilty of.
I think probably the number one thing

2448
02:03:19,851 --> 02:03:24,380
for me over the past few months has been
this trump thing where people simply

2449
02:03:24,381 --> 02:03:27,110
can't understand.
They think I'm his waterboy,

2450
02:03:27,140 --> 02:03:29,390
which of course I'm not,
but I'm simply saying,

2451
02:03:29,391 --> 02:03:30,020
look,
very,

2452
02:03:30,020 --> 02:03:33,350
very reasonable.
People could have converged to a trump

2453
02:03:33,530 --> 02:03:34,670
decision,
a vote,

2454
02:03:34,760 --> 02:03:38,120
but don't you think that's like one of
those 140 character criticisms?

2455
02:03:38,121 --> 02:03:40,160
Like it's really like I've been called a
trump supporter.

2456
02:03:40,161 --> 02:03:43,550
I'm 100 percent not,
but because of the fact that it's a

2457
02:03:43,551 --> 02:03:45,550
cruel thing to say to someone,
yeah,

2458
02:03:45,580 --> 02:03:46,490
still loving trump.

2459
02:03:46,490 --> 02:03:47,570
No,
you fucking idiot.

2460
02:03:47,571 --> 02:03:49,340
Like loving trump.
Right?

2461
02:03:49,341 --> 02:03:52,350
What am I gonna have a seven minute long
bit about him in my act,

2462
02:03:52,360 --> 02:03:54,540
like loving them.
Like what are you talking about it?

2463
02:03:55,340 --> 02:03:58,400
But it doesn't matter because by saying
that they could diminish you.

2464
02:03:58,430 --> 02:03:59,630
Oh,
you're a racist,

2465
02:04:00,020 --> 02:04:00,411
you know?
Oh,

2466
02:04:00,411 --> 02:04:01,740
you're a sexist,
right?

2467
02:04:01,810 --> 02:04:02,171
You know,
Oh,

2468
02:04:02,171 --> 02:04:05,330
you're like the.
One of the craziest ones is someone.

2469
02:04:05,660 --> 02:04:10,660
If someone gets unfairly or unjustly or
inaccurately accused of rape,

2470
02:04:11,510 --> 02:04:15,710
right?
Immediately that person's a rapist and

2471
02:04:15,711 --> 02:04:20,540
they did it and it is incredibly
difficult to exonerate yourself from

2472
02:04:20,541 --> 02:04:22,790
that and people that had been accused of
rape.

2473
02:04:22,820 --> 02:04:26,720
I mean not people like bill cosby.
We get accused of it 50 fucking times or

2474
02:04:26,721 --> 02:04:31,340
something crazy,
but I've known people that were accused

2475
02:04:31,341 --> 02:04:34,280
of rape and it was all a lie and they
were.

2476
02:04:34,281 --> 02:04:38,250
It was done by an ex and it was just
someone who is a scorned lover

2477
02:04:38,250 --> 02:04:43,250
and it was angry and they wanted to cast
the worst possible light on this person

2478
02:04:43,381 --> 02:04:46,560
in order to be.
Give them some tastes of the pain that

2479
02:04:46,561 --> 02:04:49,170
they feel from rejection or from
whatever reason.

2480
02:04:49,530 --> 02:04:53,730
And this is not uncommon.
I mean I don't know what the statistics

2481
02:04:53,731 --> 02:04:58,731
are as far as a false rape accusations
versus actual rape versus people who

2482
02:04:58,741 --> 02:05:02,340
were raped who don't talk about it,
but either one does not invalidate the

2483
02:05:02,341 --> 02:05:05,220
other.
By saying that a lot of women actually

2484
02:05:05,221 --> 02:05:07,770
have been raped,
which neither you nor I would ever argue

2485
02:05:07,771 --> 02:05:08,604
with.
Of course,

2486
02:05:08,670 --> 02:05:13,260
and it's a horrible crime and it's a
terrible fucking thing to do to a person

2487
02:05:13,261 --> 02:05:16,050
to take away their humanity in that way.
That does not.

2488
02:05:16,430 --> 02:05:20,460
That does not somehow or another make it
okay.

2489
02:05:20,700 --> 02:05:23,760
That people have false rape accusations.
No,

2490
02:05:23,790 --> 02:05:27,900
that's a horrific thing to.
I mean we can quantify what's worse or

2491
02:05:27,901 --> 02:05:29,310
what's better,
you know,

2492
02:05:29,311 --> 02:05:33,270
and I think we would all agree that it's
probably worse to be physically raped

2493
02:05:33,271 --> 02:05:36,390
than it is to be accused of rape when
you didn't do it,

2494
02:05:36,840 --> 02:05:38,370
but they're both gross.

2495
02:05:38,490 --> 02:05:41,400
But you have these things that I've
actually written about this.

2496
02:05:41,700 --> 02:05:46,700
Do you think that the punishments for
false accusations of rape are too lax?

2497
02:05:47,640 --> 02:05:49,830
Because I do.
I think that they don't know what they

2498
02:05:49,831 --> 02:05:51,690
are,
but I would say that they should be

2499
02:05:51,691 --> 02:05:53,010
pretty horrific,
right?

2500
02:05:53,340 --> 02:05:57,120
Almost to the.
Almost the same amount of what he would

2501
02:05:57,121 --> 02:05:59,120
have spent in prison.
Yeah,

2502
02:05:59,130 --> 02:06:03,750
I think maybe like 70 percent I think.
I think false rape accusations,

2503
02:06:03,751 --> 02:06:07,440
especially if you like really chase it
down and try to give this person locked

2504
02:06:07,441 --> 02:06:10,680
up.
I mean there's so much wrong with that.

2505
02:06:10,830 --> 02:06:14,640
It might be like 70 percent of rape,
70 percent,

2506
02:06:14,641 --> 02:06:16,440
meaning like 70 percent.
That's bad.

2507
02:06:16,650 --> 02:06:19,920
I shouldn't say a number.
I don't think it's as bad as physically

2508
02:06:19,921 --> 02:06:22,380
raping someone,
but it's in the neighborhood.

2509
02:06:22,381 --> 02:06:25,830
But I mean think of it this way.
Not to get too philosophical everyday

2510
02:06:25,860 --> 02:06:30,860
that a guy spends in prison as a falsely
accused rapist while you,

2511
02:06:31,861 --> 02:06:34,860
the woman who falsely accused him is
sitting in your house.

2512
02:06:35,130 --> 02:06:39,940
I mean you are a quote committing the
crime every day of his life,

2513
02:06:40,120 --> 02:06:42,040
every everyday that you don't step
forward,

2514
02:06:42,060 --> 02:06:43,260
punishing,
punishing,

2515
02:06:43,261 --> 02:06:43,650
right?
Yeah.

2516
02:06:43,650 --> 02:06:46,170
I mean again,
not to diminish that one act of rape,

2517
02:06:46,320 --> 02:06:50,640
but you are raping this guy
metaphorically every if not literally

2518
02:06:50,641 --> 02:06:55,560
because he probably is going to be raped
in prison for having that accusation on

2519
02:06:55,561 --> 02:06:56,394
top of his head.
Right?

2520
02:06:56,760 --> 02:06:59,370
Because that's a targeted person and
positive person,

2521
02:06:59,580 --> 02:07:03,900
so in a sense you're almost as
diabolical as a true rapist because you

2522
02:07:03,901 --> 02:07:08,070
are living with that false information
and everyday you're going to buy your

2523
02:07:08,071 --> 02:07:12,180
tomatoes and groceries.
Unencumbered by the fact that there is a

2524
02:07:12,181 --> 02:07:17,160
guy sitting in prison who was probably
passing some very ugly moments because

2525
02:07:17,161 --> 02:07:19,800
you are unwilling to correct the wrong
that you've done,

2526
02:07:19,801 --> 02:07:22,590
so I think it's a pretty diabolical
person who does that.

2527
02:07:22,620 --> 02:07:24,840
It's a definitely.
It's definitely a diabolical person.

2528
02:07:24,841 --> 02:07:27,930
The problem is whenever you bring up
this diabolical person,

2529
02:07:28,320 --> 02:07:33,150
you automatically get lumped in with
someone who has some sort of an enabler,

2530
02:07:33,151 --> 02:07:36,220
some cis gendered male

2531
02:07:36,220 --> 02:07:39,250
privileged piece of shit.
It doesn't care about actual rape

2532
02:07:39,251 --> 02:07:42,490
victims because you're more concerned
with men who get falsely accused of

2533
02:07:42,491 --> 02:07:44,410
rape.
It's just another thing.

2534
02:07:44,411 --> 02:07:47,410
It's not.
It's not diminishing the actual crime of

2535
02:07:47,411 --> 02:07:49,150
rape,
which is one of the worst things in the

2536
02:07:49,151 --> 02:07:51,400
world next to murder.
It's just a horrific,

2537
02:07:51,401 --> 02:07:56,170
terrifying aspect of human beings that
we're even capable of doing that,

2538
02:07:56,710 --> 02:08:01,710
but it doesn't mean that false rape
accusations aren't also a horrific

2539
02:08:02,141 --> 02:08:06,430
aspect of being a person.
There's just a lot of shitty behavior

2540
02:08:06,431 --> 02:08:09,880
that people exhibit and as soon as we
lock ourselves into these,

2541
02:08:10,570 --> 02:08:14,290
these little groups that will always
blindly support.

2542
02:08:14,410 --> 02:08:17,410
Like I have this bit I've been doing
lately about a bumper sticker.

2543
02:08:17,411 --> 02:08:20,440
I saw a girl's car,
it said girls kick ass.

2544
02:08:20,850 --> 02:08:23,980
Like you imagine if a guy had a bumper
sticker that said boys kick ass.

2545
02:08:24,230 --> 02:08:28,810
It's so you're signing off on $160
million people.

2546
02:08:28,811 --> 02:08:32,320
That's so crazy.
But it's one of those things where we'll

2547
02:08:32,321 --> 02:08:37,321
allow that because we all agree that
women have a harder go of it in this

2548
02:08:38,441 --> 02:08:41,110
country in particular and other
countries far more so.

2549
02:08:41,140 --> 02:08:44,350
Right.
And we could go back to ideology for the

2550
02:08:44,351 --> 02:08:45,730
reasons for that.
What we're talking to

2551
02:08:45,740 --> 02:08:46,970
about earlier,
by the way,

2552
02:08:47,390 --> 02:08:48,710
speaking of rape,
I don't,

2553
02:08:48,810 --> 02:08:50,810
I don't think we've mentioned this.
Everyone on this show,

2554
02:08:50,870 --> 02:08:53,090
a two of my colleagues,
one of whom I know.

2555
02:08:53,091 --> 02:08:53,721
Well,
the other one,

2556
02:08:53,721 --> 02:08:58,721
not so much if at all,
wrote a book around 2000 or 2002,

2557
02:08:59,540 --> 02:09:04,130
offering an adaptive evolutionary
explanation for rape he had.

2558
02:09:04,131 --> 02:09:05,760
There Ya go.
You don't need to hear anything more

2559
02:09:05,761 --> 02:09:06,690
than that.
So.

2560
02:09:07,780 --> 02:09:08,541
Yeah,
exactly.

2561
02:09:08,541 --> 02:09:12,680
So actually I'll tell you their names.
So Randy Thornhill,

2562
02:09:12,681 --> 02:09:14,360
who's a very,
very serious scientists,

2563
02:09:14,570 --> 02:09:16,610
and Craig Palmer,
they wrote a book,

2564
02:09:16,790 --> 02:09:21,050
I think it was in 2000 now.
They weren't of course,

2565
02:09:21,140 --> 02:09:23,570
justifying rape,
condoning it.

2566
02:09:23,810 --> 02:09:24,621
They were saying,
look,

2567
02:09:24,621 --> 02:09:29,570
if you wish to understand rape,
then you better have a good scientific

2568
02:09:29,571 --> 02:09:33,970
basis for why it happens,
and therefore they offered something

2569
02:09:33,990 --> 02:09:35,240
adaptive argument.
Which by the way,

2570
02:09:35,241 --> 02:09:37,040
that's one of the main things that
people will hate.

2571
02:09:37,041 --> 02:09:39,500
Evolution psychology commit as a
fallacy.

2572
02:09:39,770 --> 02:09:41,720
They think that when you explain a
phenomenon,

2573
02:09:41,940 --> 02:09:44,870
you are justifying it.
So if you explain why men and women

2574
02:09:44,871 --> 02:09:48,350
might cheat on one another and
monogamous unions or you're offering a

2575
02:09:48,351 --> 02:09:50,720
scientific justification for cheating,
of course you're not.

2576
02:09:50,990 --> 02:09:54,050
Usually.
My rebuttal is the guy who studies

2577
02:09:54,051 --> 02:09:55,490
cancer,
an oncologist.

2578
02:09:55,670 --> 02:09:57,650
Does that mean he is for pancreatic
cancer?

2579
02:09:57,651 --> 02:09:58,640
He's justifying.
No,

2580
02:09:58,641 --> 02:10:01,250
he's just trying to explain why
pancreatic cancer happens.

2581
02:10:01,251 --> 02:10:01,850
Is that across

2582
02:10:01,850 --> 02:10:02,750
the board though?
I mean,

2583
02:10:02,751 --> 02:10:07,751
what if you try to explain why people
commit violent crimes or explain why

2584
02:10:08,181 --> 02:10:10,580
people steal things from stores?

2585
02:10:11,200 --> 02:10:14,680
That's a great question.
I think there are certain phenomena that

2586
02:10:14,681 --> 02:10:18,250
triggered that response more than others
and it's an open empirical question.

2587
02:10:18,550 --> 02:10:22,000
What's the quality of the phenomenon
that causes you to react that way or

2588
02:10:22,001 --> 02:10:22,460
not?

2589
02:10:22,460 --> 02:10:26,330
Let's say that it's most likely the
stronger person who seems to have the

2590
02:10:26,331 --> 02:10:31,100
privilege victimizing the weaker person.
Perhaps males versus females,

2591
02:10:31,100 --> 02:10:32,360
child abuse.
That's another one.

2592
02:10:32,810 --> 02:10:33,920
So actually feel.
Yeah,

2593
02:10:33,960 --> 02:10:35,300
right.
So the book,

2594
02:10:35,960 --> 02:10:38,390
so the book that got me into
evolutionary psychology,

2595
02:10:38,440 --> 02:10:39,020
I've,
I've,

2596
02:10:39,020 --> 02:10:41,510
I've mentioned this story before and
maybe not on the show.

2597
02:10:42,020 --> 02:10:46,220
It was my first semester as a doctoral
student at Cornell and the professor,

2598
02:10:46,221 --> 02:10:48,830
this was an advanced social psychology
course and the professor assigned the

2599
02:10:48,831 --> 02:10:53,300
book called homicide by two pioneers of
evolutionary psychology,

2600
02:10:53,301 --> 02:10:57,260
husband and wife team,
Margo Wilson and Martin Daly where the

2601
02:10:57,261 --> 02:11:02,261
book is about understanding patterns of
criminality via an evolutionary lens.

2602
02:11:03,050 --> 02:11:08,050
And one of the things in the book that
had struck me as so powerful was looking

2603
02:11:08,781 --> 02:11:13,781
at child abuse in the home and then the
demonstration that there's a very clear

2604
02:11:14,001 --> 02:11:17,460
evolutionary reason why that happens.
So let me ask you that.

2605
02:11:17,480 --> 02:11:19,250
I have.
We discussed this before in this show.

2606
02:11:19,251 --> 02:11:20,840
I don't think so.
I don't recall.

2607
02:11:21,600 --> 02:11:22,910
Can you guess at all?

2608
02:11:22,960 --> 02:11:26,570
Uh,
what is the number one greatest

2609
02:11:26,571 --> 02:11:30,890
predictor of there being a child abuse
in the home?

2610
02:11:30,920 --> 02:11:32,000
So for example,
you might say,

2611
02:11:32,240 --> 02:11:33,200
oh,
it's poverty.

2612
02:11:33,260 --> 02:11:36,860
You might say it's probably parents that
were abused as children.

2613
02:11:37,640 --> 02:11:39,230
No bigger than that.
Bigger than that,

2614
02:11:39,231 --> 02:11:44,231
much bigger.
That one factor is 100 fold greater

2615
02:11:44,361 --> 02:11:45,210
than.
So in other words,

2616
02:11:45,470 --> 02:11:48,860
typically when you say a what's called
an odds,

2617
02:11:48,861 --> 02:11:52,730
likelihood ratio one point two.
So you have a 20 percent greater chance

2618
02:11:52,731 --> 02:11:57,110
of getting cancer if you smoke.
So just having one point,

2619
02:11:57,111 --> 02:11:59,810
two greater odds is considered a big
number here.

2620
02:11:59,811 --> 02:12:03,410
I'm telling you a hundred fold greater.
So it's something that's almost never

2621
02:12:03,411 --> 02:12:07,400
seen in science.
What does having a step parent in the

2622
02:12:07,401 --> 02:12:11,510
home
now think again here,

2623
02:12:11,960 --> 02:12:15,530
another animal.
And to get the people who don't like 100

2624
02:12:15,531 --> 02:12:16,970
times greater.
This is this.

2625
02:12:17,330 --> 02:12:22,190
So actually it's now been called the
Cinderella effect because their Ela,

2626
02:12:22,310 --> 02:12:22,550
right?

2627
02:12:22,550 --> 02:12:24,490
She shows the,
the,

2628
02:12:24,491 --> 02:12:29,491
the evil step mother loves her two
biological daughters but hates the

2629
02:12:30,141 --> 02:12:32,150
stepdaughter Cinderella.
So that's okay.

2630
02:12:32,660 --> 02:12:34,670
Now think about with lions,
right?

2631
02:12:34,980 --> 02:12:39,980
In a lion pride,
you have a one or two dominant males who

2632
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:44,930
who control and protect the pride and
who control sexual access to the

2633
02:12:44,931 --> 02:12:49,460
females.
There's constant testing of these males

2634
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:54,760
by bands of young males who are looking
to take over and for awhile the resident

2635
02:12:55,071 --> 02:12:59,810
males went out and then eventually they
lose when they lose and they're either

2636
02:12:59,811 --> 02:13:04,811
killed or banished from the pride.
What's the first thing that the new

2637
02:13:05,240 --> 02:13:08,060
incoming bosses do?
They kill the boobies.

2638
02:13:08,210 --> 02:13:09,980
Boom.
They kill the babies.

2639
02:13:10,070 --> 02:13:14,550
What happens to the females that the
lionesses one,

2640
02:13:14,600 --> 02:13:16,620
they killed him.
They go into estrus,

2641
02:13:16,780 --> 02:13:20,030
right?
So instead of playing Barry White Music

2642
02:13:20,031 --> 02:13:23,000
and the violin to get them in the mood,
killed their children and they get in

2643
02:13:23,001 --> 02:13:23,451
the mood,
right?

2644
02:13:23,451 --> 02:13:24,590
Nature is brutal,
right?

2645
02:13:24,890 --> 02:13:26,570
Well,
in the context of humans,

2646
02:13:26,900 --> 02:13:31,900
when you have a step parent who is not
biologically linked

2647
02:13:32,280 --> 02:13:35,730
to the child,
it simply increases the likelihood of

2648
02:13:35,731 --> 02:13:39,840
there being abuse right.
Now usually when you explain this,

2649
02:13:40,080 --> 02:13:41,610
what is the first thing that people say,
oh,

2650
02:13:41,611 --> 02:13:44,100
well I grew up with a stepfather and he
didn't do this to me.

2651
02:13:44,101 --> 02:13:46,060
You're an asshole or,
but,

2652
02:13:46,210 --> 02:13:48,660
but what are you saying?
That means it's okay to do it because

2653
02:13:48,661 --> 02:13:52,350
you're explaining it.
So look how they can flate explaining a

2654
02:13:52,351 --> 02:13:54,900
phenomenon with justifying the
phenomenon.

2655
02:13:55,320 --> 02:13:59,040
So I think rape,
child abuse and probably marital

2656
02:13:59,041 --> 02:14:04,041
infidelity are the three evolutionary
phenomena that when you explain using an

2657
02:14:04,831 --> 02:14:06,990
evolutionary lens,
people go completely Wacko.

2658
02:14:07,600 --> 02:14:09,120
Yeah,
that makes a lot of sense.

2659
02:14:09,510 --> 02:14:11,940
I mean,
it's something that it's.

2660
02:14:12,900 --> 02:14:15,460
You almost can't look at it.
It's right.

2661
02:14:15,890 --> 02:14:19,320
Forbidden in Islam village as per my
conversation with Sam Harris,

2662
02:14:19,350 --> 02:14:22,830
avoid that topic because you'll get too
much flack and that's dangerous.

2663
02:14:22,831 --> 02:14:25,440
Nothing should be forbidden.
So these scientists that wrote this

2664
02:14:25,441 --> 02:14:27,420
book,
whether they were examining rape and the

2665
02:14:27,421 --> 02:14:29,850
causes of rape,
what was the repercussions?

2666
02:14:30,030 --> 02:14:32,220
So I,
I was invited.

2667
02:14:32,221 --> 02:14:35,880
So around the Thorn Hill is at the
University of New Mexico and he's still

2668
02:14:35,930 --> 02:14:37,260
there.
Great Guy.

2669
02:14:37,740 --> 02:14:42,360
When when he invited me to his group,
invited me to give a talk at the

2670
02:14:42,361 --> 02:14:44,610
university,
him and I went out for a while and I

2671
02:14:44,611 --> 02:14:47,490
asked him that question.
He said at one point there had to be

2672
02:14:47,491 --> 02:14:52,491
constant police patrols because of all
the death threats and so on that he,

2673
02:14:52,861 --> 02:14:55,580
that he was getting nih.
I suspect that at this point in a

2674
02:14:55,581 --> 02:14:57,210
subsided,
this is 15,

2675
02:14:57,211 --> 02:15:00,240
16 years ago,
but when the book first came out,

2676
02:15:00,420 --> 02:15:02,430
it was dangerous to be around the
thornhill.

2677
02:15:02,490 --> 02:15:04,830
Well,
this is so bizarre where people that you

2678
02:15:04,831 --> 02:15:06,210
would think of the left,
right?

2679
02:15:06,211 --> 02:15:08,790
And as soon as you think of people that
are liberal and progressive,

2680
02:15:08,791 --> 02:15:12,360
you think these are nonviolent folks
that just want peace and happiness and

2681
02:15:12,361 --> 02:15:14,790
love.
But look what happened in Evergreen.

2682
02:15:15,030 --> 02:15:17,130
I mean this is what Bret Weinstein
talked about,

2683
02:15:17,131 --> 02:15:19,020
the threats,
and then all of a sudden you've got

2684
02:15:19,021 --> 02:15:23,280
vigilante patrols with tasers and
baseball bats and these are kids that

2685
02:15:23,281 --> 02:15:26,910
are running around trying to justify
using violence because someone doesn't

2686
02:15:26,911 --> 02:15:30,510
agree with their thoughts.
The whole idea of it was a day of

2687
02:15:30,511 --> 02:15:32,880
absence,
day of inclusion or does it day of

2688
02:15:32,881 --> 02:15:33,714
presence.
Right.

2689
02:15:33,870 --> 02:15:37,940
That was the idea was that white people
should stay home just once.

2690
02:15:37,980 --> 02:15:39,450
He was like,
that's fucking racist,

2691
02:15:39,451 --> 02:15:41,340
like you can't do that.
And He,

2692
02:15:41,730 --> 02:15:45,720
as he self describes as a deeply
progressive person in all my

2693
02:15:45,721 --> 02:15:49,440
conversations with him indicate that in
a huge way.

2694
02:15:49,441 --> 02:15:53,550
I mean he's just a really open minded,
progressive guy who he doesn't,

2695
02:15:53,670 --> 02:15:57,570
but he doesn't want racism against white
people to exist any more than he wants

2696
02:15:57,571 --> 02:15:59,550
it against black people.
But by the way,

2697
02:15:59,551 --> 02:16:01,650
I was.
So he came on my show too.

2698
02:16:01,650 --> 02:16:05,760
We had a great chat and second hiding.
Now interrupted.

2699
02:16:05,780 --> 02:16:06,031
Yeah.
No,

2700
02:16:06,031 --> 02:16:07,420
no problem.
Uh,

2701
02:16:07,770 --> 02:16:10,110
I,
I don't know if full hiding,

2702
02:16:10,111 --> 02:16:14,010
but he certainly not on campus,
but that's what he said.

2703
02:16:14,011 --> 02:16:15,880
He had to move his family.
Yeah.

2704
02:16:15,900 --> 02:16:17,610
Even know where.
But maybe I shouldn't say weird.

2705
02:16:18,120 --> 02:16:19,350
Yeah.
Well,

2706
02:16:19,890 --> 02:16:23,250
if you look at the comments section,
I wonder if the same thing happened when

2707
02:16:23,251 --> 02:16:27,600
he came on your show.
I was amazed at the animus that he was

2708
02:16:27,601 --> 02:16:30,310
being levied at him from people who were
saying,

2709
02:16:30,311 --> 02:16:33,130
Hey,
that guy is part of the problem.

2710
02:16:33,340 --> 02:16:37,840
He's a progressive who created the
monster that is now biting his ass,

2711
02:16:37,990 --> 02:16:41,480
and so let him let,
let let the snake and so on.

2712
02:16:41,510 --> 02:16:42,630
Charitable.
You didn't get.

2713
02:16:42,830 --> 02:16:43,810
No,
I didn't get that,

2714
02:16:43,811 --> 02:16:48,760
but I do understand why fools would
think because he's not real true.

2715
02:16:48,761 --> 02:16:51,910
Progressives like non ideologically
based progressive.

2716
02:16:51,910 --> 02:16:53,280
It's a good thing.
Exactly.

2717
02:16:53,310 --> 02:16:55,690
It's a good thing to note until the
think that,

2718
02:16:55,691 --> 02:16:57,790
hey man,
we should all be the same regardless of

2719
02:16:57,820 --> 02:17:00,910
your dreadlocks or a shaved head or if
you're white or black or.

2720
02:17:01,390 --> 02:17:04,260
It's a weird thing like,
like sexual preference.

2721
02:17:04,310 --> 02:17:08,740
We were talking about this before,
like if a man is only sexually attracted

2722
02:17:08,741 --> 02:17:11,440
to.
If he says I am sexually attractive,

2723
02:17:11,441 --> 02:17:14,650
I prefer white women.
You are a fucking racist.

2724
02:17:14,860 --> 02:17:17,140
But if you say,
I prefer black women.

2725
02:17:17,170 --> 02:17:19,780
Like Ooh,
spice it weird.

2726
02:17:19,810 --> 02:17:21,070
By the way,
this,

2727
02:17:21,100 --> 02:17:22,320
this cuts both ways.
So,

2728
02:17:22,360 --> 02:17:27,360
and I actually commented on this,
if you say I'm attracted to overweight

2729
02:17:27,611 --> 02:17:32,500
women,
you are objectifying and fetishizing are

2730
02:17:32,860 --> 02:17:35,620
corpulent bodies or you know,
that's what they'll say.

2731
02:17:35,970 --> 02:17:38,140
That's what they'll sell the
complainer's I should be happy.

2732
02:17:38,141 --> 02:17:41,830
Somebody likes.
If you say I don't like fat women

2733
02:17:42,250 --> 02:17:43,940
because I'm not,
then of course you're,

2734
02:17:43,960 --> 02:17:44,590
you're so.

2735
02:17:44,590 --> 02:17:45,940
Same thing with,
with black women,

2736
02:17:45,941 --> 02:17:46,720
right?
If you say,

2737
02:17:46,720 --> 02:17:48,610
look,
I just have a preference for black

2738
02:17:48,611 --> 02:17:49,480
women.
Oh yeah.

2739
02:17:49,481 --> 02:17:52,810
It's the old stereotype of the sexual
black woman with a beautiful behind.

2740
02:17:52,990 --> 02:17:54,730
You're objectifying us,
you're racist.

2741
02:17:54,880 --> 02:17:55,990
If you say,
you know,

2742
02:17:55,991 --> 02:17:57,460
I really don't like the,
the,

2743
02:17:57,461 --> 02:17:59,260
the,
the body types of black women.

2744
02:17:59,261 --> 02:18:01,240
I prefer Asian women while you are
racist.

2745
02:18:01,330 --> 02:18:04,630
So all roads lead to you being an
asshole.

2746
02:18:04,720 --> 02:18:05,890
If you like them,
it's bad.

2747
02:18:05,891 --> 02:18:07,030
If you don't like them,
it's bad.

2748
02:18:07,420 --> 02:18:11,560
What if you just say you just enjoy
dating black women because of the way

2749
02:18:11,561 --> 02:18:14,070
the communicate.
Some race,

2750
02:18:14,160 --> 02:18:18,130
someone will probably accusing,
listen at correcting somebody for their

2751
02:18:18,131 --> 02:18:21,460
grammar.
If it's part of their dialect is racist.

2752
02:18:21,461 --> 02:18:23,290
Right?
So Ebonics.

2753
02:18:23,600 --> 02:18:24,433
I actually,
I was,

2754
02:18:24,790 --> 02:18:29,530
I was coming when we were coming here.
I was listening to a song by a see

2755
02:18:29,640 --> 02:18:31,600
Sierra Sierra general.

2756
02:18:31,640 --> 02:18:32,470
That is.
No,

2757
02:18:32,470 --> 02:18:35,290
she's a,
she's a hip hop singer and at one point

2758
02:18:35,291 --> 02:18:37,930
in one of the songs she goes,
there you is.

2759
02:18:38,170 --> 02:18:40,000
There you is.
So I told my wife,

2760
02:18:40,001 --> 02:18:40,781
I said,
you know,

2761
02:18:40,781 --> 02:18:43,900
it really pisses me off when they commit
these grammatical errors.

2762
02:18:43,970 --> 02:18:45,910
Yeah,
but isn't that an art thing?

2763
02:18:45,960 --> 02:18:48,760
I mean like I might say something
grammatically incorrect on stage,

2764
02:18:48,761 --> 02:18:50,770
everything.
It's funnier than saying it correctly.

2765
02:18:50,860 --> 02:18:51,400
Okay,
fine.

2766
02:18:51,400 --> 02:18:55,570
If you're doing it because it is part of
the sort of the contextualized shtick,

2767
02:18:55,660 --> 02:18:58,000
but isn't that what she's kind of doing
a rap song?

2768
02:18:58,210 --> 02:18:59,490
I don't know.
I don't know.

2769
02:18:59,500 --> 02:19:00,410
It's an open question.
I don't know.

2770
02:19:00,420 --> 02:19:02,830
Maybe it just rhymes better.
There you are.

2771
02:19:02,831 --> 02:19:04,820
Don't say there you,
but what if it's.

2772
02:19:04,950 --> 02:19:08,260
She's trying to run what rhymes with his
fizz fizz.

2773
02:19:08,380 --> 02:19:10,890
Yeah.
I don't sit in champagne.

2774
02:19:11,020 --> 02:19:13,320
Get my fears it.
Look over there.

2775
02:19:13,450 --> 02:19:16,210
There you is.
Should have been a rapper,

2776
02:19:16,220 --> 02:19:16,991
dude,
by the way,

2777
02:19:16,991 --> 02:19:18,610
you said.
You said that.

2778
02:19:18,650 --> 02:19:21,310
I'm saying that you were attracted to
black women.

2779
02:19:21,311 --> 02:19:24,340
Might be racist or not.
Did you hear the latest with the new,

2780
02:19:24,341 --> 02:19:27,950
um,
letter that was uncovered from Tupac

2781
02:19:27,950 --> 02:19:30,770
Shakur to a white chicks that.
No,

2782
02:19:30,860 --> 02:19:33,740
no.
That he broke up with her because she

2783
02:19:33,741 --> 02:19:35,990
was a white woman.
He broke up with Madonna.

2784
02:19:36,050 --> 02:19:36,883
Madonna.
Yeah.

2785
02:19:37,820 --> 02:19:40,130
She was annoying.
It was just trying to find an excuse.

2786
02:19:40,310 --> 02:19:42,470
That's a good way like that.
You can't ever change,

2787
02:19:42,670 --> 02:19:44,120
right?
You can't change the fact that you're

2788
02:19:44,121 --> 02:19:45,620
white.
That's a good move.

2789
02:19:45,800 --> 02:19:47,630
But imagine that the other way around.
Right.

2790
02:19:47,631 --> 02:19:48,230
If,
if,

2791
02:19:48,230 --> 02:19:50,570
if,
if she had written him a letter saying,

2792
02:19:50,571 --> 02:19:51,440
hey,
dear Tupac,

2793
02:19:51,441 --> 02:19:52,910
I would have loved to continue this
relationship,

2794
02:19:52,911 --> 02:19:55,880
but given that you're a black guy,
her career would be over.

2795
02:19:56,120 --> 02:19:59,180
But him saying it to her,
he actually said,

2796
02:19:59,181 --> 02:20:00,230
he goes,
he said,

2797
02:20:00,470 --> 02:20:03,020
if you date me,
it appears as though you're an exciting

2798
02:20:03,021 --> 02:20:05,750
cool woman,
but if I continue to date you,

2799
02:20:05,870 --> 02:20:08,210
a lot of the people that made me who I
am would,

2800
02:20:08,450 --> 02:20:10,740
I would lose credit with the credit.

2801
02:20:11,350 --> 02:20:13,430
Taiwan,
she was thrown that posted correctly.

2802
02:20:13,431 --> 02:20:16,130
Probably still would have stuck around.
She's probably annoying.

2803
02:20:18,560 --> 02:20:21,920
She probably talks too much.
She probably talks about herself in the

2804
02:20:21,921 --> 02:20:25,400
third person,
like trump probably likes you.

2805
02:20:25,470 --> 02:20:27,890
Right?
I'm going to admit something now that's

2806
02:20:27,920 --> 02:20:29,750
going to come back to the hotline.
What?

2807
02:20:30,410 --> 02:20:33,080
Nineteen 85.
My cousin and I.

2808
02:20:33,740 --> 02:20:35,360
I shouldn't be saying this.
What did you do?

2809
02:20:35,430 --> 02:20:39,850
Drove to Toronto to see Madonna.
I would have done that.

2810
02:20:39,870 --> 02:20:42,620
Nineteen 85.
She was a fantastic performer.

2811
02:20:42,830 --> 02:20:45,290
She was a huge superstar.
Still kind of is.

2812
02:20:45,440 --> 02:20:47,690
I'm just joking around about being her,
her being annoying.

2813
02:20:47,691 --> 02:20:50,840
It's just a funny thing to say.
I was always big madonna fan when I was

2814
02:20:50,841 --> 02:20:51,674
younger.
I think,

2815
02:20:51,730 --> 02:20:55,280
you know,
is beautiful and interesting and bold

2816
02:20:55,281 --> 02:20:57,380
and mean.
You don't get that without a certain

2817
02:20:57,381 --> 02:20:59,690
amount of ego.
So to mock that ego is like,

2818
02:20:59,691 --> 02:21:00,560
well,
of course,

2819
02:21:00,590 --> 02:21:01,310
you know,
it's like,

2820
02:21:01,310 --> 02:21:03,040
that's who she was.
Yeah,

2821
02:21:03,350 --> 02:21:04,050
true.
You know,

2822
02:21:04,050 --> 02:21:06,290
and then I'm with Tupac is doing this.

2823
02:21:06,430 --> 02:21:10,310
I mean he's kind of like locked into the
identity politics of the 19 nineties.

2824
02:21:10,311 --> 02:21:11,580
I mean,
that's what,

2825
02:21:11,640 --> 02:21:13,220
what,
where he was,

2826
02:21:13,640 --> 02:21:14,473
you know,
is there,

2827
02:21:14,570 --> 02:21:18,140
is there a,
a person that you would love to have on

2828
02:21:18,141 --> 02:21:23,060
your show who is a artist that you
really love?

2829
02:21:24,180 --> 02:21:25,910
Um,
there's a lot of them.

2830
02:21:26,080 --> 02:21:29,290
There's not one.
There's one that's coming on my show.

2831
02:21:29,360 --> 02:21:30,380
I'll tell you who it is,
who,

2832
02:21:30,680 --> 02:21:32,080
uh,
I had announced this.

2833
02:21:32,100 --> 02:21:35,150
I hope that he doesn't somehow back out,
but I'll mention it doesn't matter if he

2834
02:21:35,151 --> 02:21:36,220
doesn't end up coming.
That's okay.

2835
02:21:36,550 --> 02:21:37,310
Have you,
do you know,

2836
02:21:37,310 --> 02:21:39,270
have you heard of Newton the way?
No,

2837
02:21:39,660 --> 02:21:40,770
no.
It's Ricky Martin.

2838
02:21:40,771 --> 02:21:41,604
No,
I'm kidding.

2839
02:21:41,980 --> 02:21:42,700
No,
it's.

2840
02:21:42,700 --> 02:21:44,280
I live in Lavita logo.
Do you know,

2841
02:21:44,350 --> 02:21:46,910
do you know the group stylistics?
No.

2842
02:21:47,380 --> 02:21:51,320
The stylistics,
we're a old soul group that's part of a

2843
02:21:51,440 --> 02:21:53,150
genre called the philly sound.

2844
02:21:53,570 --> 02:21:57,500
So there's a type of black music that
late sixties,

2845
02:21:57,501 --> 02:22:01,730
early seventies that's is very soulful,
sexy soul type of music sites,

2846
02:22:02,120 --> 02:22:04,430
stylistics.
We're probably the epitome of that,

2847
02:22:04,431 --> 02:22:05,251
John.
Now.

2848
02:22:05,251 --> 02:22:08,780
This is a group that I grew up listening
to all the way back in Lebanon when I

2849
02:22:08,781 --> 02:22:13,781
was a kid and I've made contact with the
representatives of the lead singer and

2850
02:22:15,051 --> 02:22:16,690
he said that he will come on my show.
It's like,

2851
02:22:16,700 --> 02:22:17,860
oh,
exciting.

2852
02:22:18,170 --> 02:22:20,300
So all the people that I've had on my
show,

2853
02:22:20,301 --> 02:22:23,300
all of whom had been lovely and
accomplished people I think,

2854
02:22:23,960 --> 02:22:26,700
and I hope I'm not being insulting to
anybody.

2855
02:22:26,701 --> 02:22:29,310
I don't think I'm as excited to be
speaking to anyone which shows,

2856
02:22:29,311 --> 02:22:30,540
by the way,
the power of music,

2857
02:22:30,541 --> 02:22:33,240
right?
As much as I am in speaking to this

2858
02:22:33,241 --> 02:22:34,240
gentleman.
Uh,

2859
02:22:34,610 --> 02:22:37,970
you know,
who in this area go there.

2860
02:22:39,510 --> 02:22:43,290
That's actually not the singer,
a set of bare chest under a suit coat.

2861
02:22:43,380 --> 02:22:47,040
That's the guy that's rustled Thompkins
Jr.

2862
02:22:47,130 --> 02:22:49,200
Wow.
Fro strong.

2863
02:22:49,350 --> 02:22:50,830
He's got What's called the falsetto
voice.

2864
02:22:50,831 --> 02:22:52,560
She goes very,
very high with his voice.

2865
02:22:55,950 --> 02:22:59,130
You are
very good.

2866
02:22:59,131 --> 02:23:01,890
And I've heard that song.
Isn't it Funny how like people used to

2867
02:23:01,891 --> 02:23:06,600
dance and move back then everyone waS
like synchronized and there was like a

2868
02:23:06,601 --> 02:23:09,960
thing they used to do together.
I know that doesn't really happen

2869
02:23:09,961 --> 02:23:11,610
anymore.
I wonder what happened where people

2870
02:23:11,611 --> 02:23:14,970
decided that synchronized singing like
five men together stage.

2871
02:23:14,971 --> 02:23:16,170
It's not cool anymore.
Well,

2872
02:23:16,180 --> 02:23:19,730
you do Have boy bands.
You have backstreet boys or men is men.

2873
02:23:19,750 --> 02:23:21,000
Yeah.
These are men.

2874
02:23:21,150 --> 02:23:24,450
These are.
This is five men moving their arms and

2875
02:23:24,451 --> 02:23:27,540
singing in synchronicity while people
dance slowly,

2876
02:23:27,541 --> 02:23:30,210
which no one does anymore.
No one dances like that anymore.

2877
02:23:30,300 --> 02:23:33,630
Who fucks things like that anymore?
Who fucked dance that dances like that

2878
02:23:33,631 --> 02:23:34,441
anymore?
It's weird,

2879
02:23:34,441 --> 02:23:36,660
right?
I know someone needs to bring back the

2880
02:23:36,670 --> 02:23:39,000
soul,
train it in 2001.

2881
02:23:39,001 --> 02:23:43,230
When we lived in southern California,
I had the crazy idea of calling the

2882
02:23:43,231 --> 02:23:48,231
representatives of the stylistics to see
how much it would cost to hire them for

2883
02:23:48,960 --> 02:23:50,220
private concert.

2884
02:23:50,430 --> 02:23:53,550
Somehow I thought that a professor had
enough of a salary.

2885
02:23:54,300 --> 02:23:57,130
The higher the stylistics for a private
concert.

2886
02:23:57,180 --> 02:23:58,940
How many people apparently,
you know,

2887
02:23:58,980 --> 02:24:00,790
I just had this fantasy that,
you know,

2888
02:24:01,110 --> 02:24:06,110
wouldn't it be amazing to invite people
to apparently a much poorer than I think

2889
02:24:07,171 --> 02:24:07,950
I am?
Yeah.

2890
02:24:07,950 --> 02:24:10,260
I think it's five dudes.
It was actually.

2891
02:24:10,290 --> 02:24:12,180
I can't remember the exact amount,
but it was something in the order.

2892
02:24:12,181 --> 02:24:13,510
this is 15,
16 years ago it was,

2893
02:24:13,600 --> 02:24:15,660
I can't remember.
Maybe half a million dollars.

2894
02:24:16,110 --> 02:24:21,110
The cost of flying them in their fee,
so I went to uc irvine was not paying me

2895
02:24:22,201 --> 02:24:23,850
enough.
I can't remember the exact number,

2896
02:24:23,851 --> 02:24:25,500
but it was much more than I could
afford.

2897
02:24:25,590 --> 02:24:27,060
Wow.
What were you hoping for?

2898
02:24:27,061 --> 02:24:29,840
Like 10 grand,
50 thouSand,

2899
02:24:30,240 --> 02:24:33,040
50,000 you were hoping for?
Yeah,

2900
02:24:33,120 --> 02:24:35,770
that would seem like reasonable.
That's like,

2901
02:24:35,800 --> 02:24:38,100
you know,
I thought I had joe rogan money,

2902
02:24:38,400 --> 02:24:43,390
but I only have mere professor money
that's even 50,000.

2903
02:24:43,390 --> 02:24:45,060
It's like I wouldn't spend that much
money.

2904
02:24:45,660 --> 02:24:47,610
It's christ.
If you could.

2905
02:24:47,910 --> 02:24:49,940
What's your favorite group?
It's probably metallica.

2906
02:24:51,810 --> 02:24:53,380
Metallica.
I love me some metallic,

2907
02:24:53,381 --> 02:24:55,170
especially when I'm working out and
shit.

2908
02:24:55,370 --> 02:24:57,930
I mean you did tell me prior to us
starting how much you love share.

2909
02:24:57,960 --> 02:25:01,920
you didn't say these tramps and thieves.
That's what town.

2910
02:25:02,070 --> 02:25:05,100
So who's your favorite?
I'm not have a favorite.

2911
02:25:06,290 --> 02:25:09,180
give me really don't led zepplin.
Okay.

2912
02:25:09,181 --> 02:25:11,700
Led zepplin you found out they steal
music.

2913
02:25:12,730 --> 02:25:16,080
Stairway to heaven story.
I'd heard that hurts pretty bad,

2914
02:25:16,140 --> 02:25:20,070
but then they get almond brothers.
They got exonerated as they paid off

2915
02:25:20,071 --> 02:25:21,060
some fucking.
Is that true?

2916
02:25:21,210 --> 02:25:23,470
Do you know how much money they would
have to give back?

2917
02:25:23,471 --> 02:25:24,250
How much the record

2918
02:25:24,250 --> 02:25:27,130
companies would have to give back?
But it was established and it was

2919
02:25:27,131 --> 02:25:28,540
stolen.
Like in terms of the.

2920
02:25:28,580 --> 02:25:31,300
You want to play it?
You want to play here?

2921
02:25:31,350 --> 02:25:32,350
Here.
Let's play it.

2922
02:25:32,380 --> 02:25:34,600
So we could just.
Can we do it or would they were they?

2923
02:25:34,601 --> 02:25:37,260
Fuck us.
Youtube fargo's alright.

2924
02:25:37,360 --> 02:25:40,630
So we'll,
we'll do this and it won't be on youtube

2925
02:25:40,660 --> 02:25:42,290
to the people listening right now on
youtube.

2926
02:25:42,291 --> 02:25:45,010
You're not going to hear shit,
but this is what we'll do.

2927
02:25:45,250 --> 02:25:49,960
We will synchronize.
Jamie will tell you what this is and you

2928
02:25:49,961 --> 02:25:52,130
can synchronize it doesn't even work
like that.

2929
02:25:52,131 --> 02:25:54,130
Can you open up to youtube windows?
I'll put up the.

2930
02:25:54,131 --> 02:25:58,330
I can put the video in the corner so you
can see what we're up a 56 second video

2931
02:25:58,331 --> 02:26:01,130
called led up verse spirit stairway to
heaven comparison.

2932
02:26:01,450 --> 02:26:03,490
So we'll have to kind of talk a little
bit of it.

2933
02:26:03,490 --> 02:26:05,440
Otherwise,
the people that are listening to this

2934
02:26:05,500 --> 02:26:07,510
live streaming,
you're going to get this,

2935
02:26:07,730 --> 02:26:09,610
it's just going to be blank,
dead air.

2936
02:26:09,910 --> 02:26:14,910
So this is the originAl song.
This is not the led zeppelIn version.

2937
02:26:15,070 --> 02:26:19,400
This is the song that lead's up.
Been fucking ripped off exactly.

2938
02:26:19,490 --> 02:26:24,490
Like dude is 100 percent.
It's not like 80 percent or 70 percent.

2939
02:26:26,850 --> 02:26:28,870
That's 100 percent.
They stole this.

2940
02:26:29,050 --> 02:26:30,880
This band opened for them.
Oh,

2941
02:26:30,890 --> 02:26:34,000
it's only one of many.
I mean there's a lot of influences that

2942
02:26:34,001 --> 02:26:37,720
they had from old blues songs that they
added to some of their songs,

2943
02:26:37,721 --> 02:26:41,770
which is more forgivable,
almost a kin to what they do today with

2944
02:26:42,130 --> 02:26:43,600
rap music,
with sampling,

2945
02:26:43,960 --> 02:26:45,550
which I don't have any problem with it
all.

2946
02:26:45,551 --> 02:26:48,850
I mean I think it kind of enhances it
and makes you think about the old song.

2947
02:26:49,540 --> 02:26:52,840
But this is agregious.
So what was their position?

2948
02:26:52,841 --> 02:26:55,600
It just happened by fluke that we came
up with the same notes,

2949
02:26:55,690 --> 02:26:59,260
just hired the best lawyers.
They got themselves some jews.

2950
02:27:00,520 --> 02:27:01,910
Is that,
is that nsma?

2951
02:27:01,930 --> 02:27:04,870
That's awesome.
At being lawyers.

2952
02:27:05,020 --> 02:27:07,870
So here,
did you play the okay as both of them.

2953
02:27:10,200 --> 02:27:12,280
Okay.
We'll play the play the second part of

2954
02:27:12,281 --> 02:27:14,330
the first one.
So the first one is stairway to heaven.

2955
02:27:14,950 --> 02:27:17,080
Where does it go?
There's a better version of it.

2956
02:27:17,690 --> 02:27:18,760
Oh,
that's the compare it.

2957
02:27:18,820 --> 02:27:19,870
Okay.
Well let's

2958
02:27:21,590 --> 02:27:23,140
go back to it.
See if you can.

2959
02:27:24,640 --> 02:27:25,451
What?
We'll see.

2960
02:27:25,451 --> 02:27:27,070
Which one is a.
Okay,

2961
02:27:27,071 --> 02:27:28,390
here we go.
This is.

2962
02:27:29,990 --> 02:27:33,920
This is the California bands psychedelic
band spirit.

2963
02:27:34,970 --> 02:27:38,050
This is a taurus.
This is not sound.

2964
02:27:38,051 --> 02:27:39,050
Now.
This is different.

2965
02:27:39,110 --> 02:27:40,220
Is that.
That's not it.

2966
02:27:40,310 --> 02:27:42,680
The taurus is the sound you're listening
to right now.

2967
02:27:42,681 --> 02:27:44,720
Hold on a second.
It changes.

2968
02:27:44,721 --> 02:27:47,750
Hold on a second here.
Okay.

2969
02:27:49,130 --> 02:27:49,963
Here.
This part.

2970
02:27:55,430 --> 02:27:56,180
Yeah.
okay.

2971
02:27:56,180 --> 02:27:59,220
The court.
That's not even a good question.

2972
02:27:59,480 --> 02:28:02,150
There's a better system.
That riff is the part that's in

2973
02:28:02,151 --> 02:28:03,170
question.
That's it.

2974
02:28:03,200 --> 02:28:06,140
Yeah.
Maybe it was one of the other songs.

2975
02:28:06,210 --> 02:28:07,043
Yeah,
there's other songs.

2976
02:28:07,180 --> 02:28:07,910
Okay.
So not,

2977
02:28:07,910 --> 02:28:08,743
not,
not.

2978
02:28:08,960 --> 02:28:12,110
Not withstanding the potential for them
having done some unsavory things.

2979
02:28:12,350 --> 02:28:13,760
They're pretty bad ass.
You couldn't.

2980
02:28:13,970 --> 02:28:18,970
You wouldn't spend $50,000.
You have as your guest of honor,

2981
02:28:18,991 --> 02:28:22,130
the godfather at your house and you say,
ladies and gentlemen,

2982
02:28:22,970 --> 02:28:25,140
ladies and gentlemen,
let's going.

2983
02:28:25,990 --> 02:28:28,700
He's a closet led zeppelin fan.
I get to.

2984
02:28:28,720 --> 02:28:30,570
He's trying to.
do we try to.

2985
02:28:30,630 --> 02:28:32,300
First of all,
you know how much money you'd have to

2986
02:28:32,301 --> 02:28:34,580
pay.
Like you always hear about these guys,

2987
02:28:34,581 --> 02:28:39,290
like I'm in the middle east,
some arabic brianna to go over there and

2988
02:28:39,291 --> 02:28:42,050
perform.
I think a million is like a bargain.

2989
02:28:43,020 --> 02:28:46,460
Yeah.
Like what didn't beyonce go and do some

2990
02:28:46,461 --> 02:28:51,461
crazy concert for new year's and dubai
for somebody for like 5 million bucks or

2991
02:28:51,531 --> 02:28:52,364
something.

2992
02:28:52,430 --> 02:28:54,680
Yeah.
That's pays to be super famous I guess.

2993
02:28:55,010 --> 02:28:58,500
What do you think of Janet Jackson
marrying some oil sha?

2994
02:28:58,610 --> 02:29:01,520
She's full on burka.
Burka,

2995
02:29:01,940 --> 02:29:04,490
yeah.
Well some of those videos need to be

2996
02:29:04,870 --> 02:29:09,020
expunged from our collective memory.
When she pulled the tid out at the

2997
02:29:09,110 --> 02:29:12,260
superbowl,
jay z and kanye paid $6,000,000 to

2998
02:29:12,261 --> 02:29:17,261
perform in dubai,
which is hilarious.

2999
02:29:18,180 --> 02:29:20,450
This.
Is there a place that you would be

3000
02:29:20,451 --> 02:29:25,451
invited for a very large sum of money
that you would refuse because you

3001
02:29:26,030 --> 02:29:30,680
disagree politically or ideologically
would whatever that person was inviting

3002
02:29:30,681 --> 02:29:33,080
you stands for sure.
Yeah,

3003
02:29:33,081 --> 02:29:34,360
for sure.
Certainly they didn't.

3004
02:29:34,510 --> 02:29:37,220
They didn't know they were bought for
some price.

3005
02:29:37,700 --> 02:29:39,740
Well,
it's a little bit different what they do

3006
02:29:39,770 --> 02:29:41,410
because they would go over there and
they,

3007
02:29:41,480 --> 02:29:44,930
I guess they would know like what their
material would be,

3008
02:29:45,260 --> 02:29:47,540
you know,
like if they went over there to perform

3009
02:29:47,541 --> 02:29:52,340
99 problems like jay z's,
his lyrics are out there,

3010
02:29:52,430 --> 02:29:53,181
you know,
they say like,

3011
02:29:53,181 --> 02:29:55,190
hey,
we would like you going to give you 6

3012
02:29:55,190 --> 02:29:55,880
million bucks.

3013
02:29:55,880 --> 02:29:58,520
We want you to sing 99 problems and all
these different songs.

3014
02:29:58,550 --> 02:30:00,470
The lyrics are clearly established.
Right.

3015
02:30:00,800 --> 02:30:03,560
But if someone like me went over there
and did comedy,

3016
02:30:03,950 --> 02:30:04,460
like,
oh,

3017
02:30:04,460 --> 02:30:06,890
who was it?
Was it who?

3018
02:30:06,990 --> 02:30:11,370
One of the guests I had in the past?
Um,

3019
02:30:11,630 --> 02:30:13,820
house parks,
I think it was house parks that went

3020
02:30:13,821 --> 02:30:18,821
over to dubai and he,
he had did a bit and he was told by one

3021
02:30:19,581 --> 02:30:23,630
of the people in the audience that he
was going to be arrested because he

3022
02:30:23,631 --> 02:30:27,530
referred to one of the royal family by
the wrong name.

3023
02:30:27,860 --> 02:30:32,510
Call them sir instead of your highness.
And so they were going to arrest him.

3024
02:30:32,511 --> 02:30:34,670
Wow.
But then some other member of the royal

3025
02:30:34,671 --> 02:30:37,430
family stepped in and stopped it because
they said no,

3026
02:30:37,431 --> 02:30:40,770
he was respectful and he just didn't
understand the traditional protocol,

3027
02:30:40,940 --> 02:30:44,660
but they were ready to lock him up in a
fucking cage because he used the wrong

3028
02:30:44,720 --> 02:30:45,553
term.

3029
02:30:45,650 --> 02:30:47,880
Not even in a disrespectful manner.
Right?

3030
02:30:48,140 --> 02:30:50,120
Yeah.
Just just called him sir.

3031
02:30:50,580 --> 02:30:52,670
You know?
Yeah.

3032
02:30:52,671 --> 02:30:55,160
Like that's not the place that I'm
going.

3033
02:30:55,700 --> 02:30:56,421
I'm,
I'm just,

3034
02:30:56,421 --> 02:30:58,640
I'm not interested in any place.
Look man,

3035
02:30:58,641 --> 02:31:00,700
there's a real problem with Canada right
now and know.

3036
02:31:00,800 --> 02:31:02,480
I know.
You know what happened in vancouver.

3037
02:31:02,481 --> 02:31:04,730
We're a comic.
Was heckled by these lesbians.

3038
02:31:04,731 --> 02:31:06,260
Yes.
And shit all over them.

3039
02:31:06,261 --> 02:31:11,261
And then they sued him and won because
he had done something to violate their

3040
02:31:11,631 --> 02:31:14,060
human rights because they were heckling,
not just him,

3041
02:31:14,061 --> 02:31:17,750
but people before him.
They were disrupting a live performance.

3042
02:31:18,050 --> 02:31:19,160
So do you think

3043
02:31:19,980 --> 02:31:24,980
this trend of famous comics refusing to
perform at universities is only going to

3044
02:31:28,411 --> 02:31:32,190
continue to increase or again,
have we reached the maximum and now

3045
02:31:32,191 --> 02:31:34,650
there's going to be blow back?
Because I know jerry seinfeld doesn't do

3046
02:31:34,651 --> 02:31:36,800
it.
Chris rock doesn't do it right.

3047
02:31:37,060 --> 02:31:40,780
I haven't done it since 2003,
maybe it was the last time I did a show

3048
02:31:41,070 --> 02:31:43,330
it as a cost center set.
Yeah.

3049
02:31:43,660 --> 02:31:45,700
I don't think they have enough life
experience.

3050
02:31:46,180 --> 02:31:47,770
You know,
I like to talk to people that have

3051
02:31:47,771 --> 02:31:48,461
lived.
When I,

3052
02:31:48,461 --> 02:31:52,540
when I talked to people I want to talk
to someone who has had affairs,

3053
02:31:52,780 --> 02:31:55,030
love affairs and uh,
has,

3054
02:31:55,031 --> 02:32:00,031
had jobs and been fired,
has had education and as I want someone

3055
02:32:00,251 --> 02:32:03,370
with life experience,
not there's anything wrong with being 18

3056
02:32:03,790 --> 02:32:05,200
or whatever,
19,

3057
02:32:05,500 --> 02:32:08,980
but I want someone who's got some living
under their belt so they know what the

3058
02:32:08,981 --> 02:32:10,220
fuck I'm talking about.
Right?

3059
02:32:10,330 --> 02:32:12,530
I don't want to have to explain
everything I don't want.

3060
02:32:12,860 --> 02:32:14,860
I did a concert once,
a concert,

3061
02:32:14,870 --> 02:32:17,920
but did a show once in the university
and I was talking about something sexual

3062
02:32:18,070 --> 02:32:20,530
and I saw this bewildered,
looks in the audience.

3063
02:32:20,950 --> 02:32:23,230
How many people are virgins?
I go,

3064
02:32:23,231 --> 02:32:25,420
don't,
don't even raise your hand because I

3065
02:32:25,421 --> 02:32:26,350
don't incriminate you.
I go,

3066
02:32:26,351 --> 02:32:29,290
just blink real fast.
And they started laughing,

3067
02:32:29,291 --> 02:32:31,330
but it got real uncomfortable.
I go,

3068
02:32:31,750 --> 02:32:32,680
would you again?
I go,

3069
02:32:32,681 --> 02:32:34,270
I'm not gonna even look at you.
I go,

3070
02:32:34,271 --> 02:32:37,420
I'm going to look at the sky.
Would you say that I would be out of

3071
02:32:37,421 --> 02:32:40,940
line if I said 10 percent of you were
virgins and the place went?

3072
02:32:40,980 --> 02:32:41,870
They went,
no,

3073
02:32:41,920 --> 02:32:42,840
no,
that's good.

3074
02:32:42,841 --> 02:32:44,860
It's probably about right.
People like yelling.

3075
02:32:44,861 --> 02:32:46,000
I'm like,
that's crazy.

3076
02:32:46,240 --> 02:32:49,780
Ten percent of you are virgins.
That's like if there's 200 people,

3077
02:32:50,160 --> 02:32:52,390
each one of you are fucking virgin is
really.

3078
02:32:52,391 --> 02:32:54,940
That's a lot of people and it's probably
more than that.

3079
02:32:54,970 --> 02:32:57,250
They're probably being modest or not
being honest about it.

3080
02:32:57,490 --> 02:33:00,100
I just,
it's not nothing wrong with being

3081
02:33:00,101 --> 02:33:02,710
college obviously,
but as far as like where I want to

3082
02:33:02,711 --> 02:33:04,090
perform,
I don't have a lot of,

3083
02:33:04,600 --> 02:33:05,920
you know,
if I have a day,

3084
02:33:05,950 --> 02:33:07,300
there's 24 hours in that day.

3085
02:33:07,300 --> 02:33:09,850
I don't have a lot of hours to perform
at night.

3086
02:33:09,910 --> 02:33:12,310
If I'm performing at night,
I get a couple of hours.

3087
02:33:12,340 --> 02:33:13,030
you know,
I'd like,

3088
02:33:13,030 --> 02:33:16,780
I like doing actual comedy,
like doing what I do and then one of the

3089
02:33:16,781 --> 02:33:21,730
things about comedy is it's,
it's different than any other art form

3090
02:33:21,731 --> 02:33:24,370
in that.
Like say if you go to see music,

3091
02:33:24,790 --> 02:33:26,260
like you know what you're going to go
see,

3092
02:33:26,261 --> 02:33:27,630
you don't usually just say,
oh,

3093
02:33:27,640 --> 02:33:28,990
live music.
Like,

3094
02:33:29,060 --> 02:33:31,000
well,
let's hope that it's something I'm

3095
02:33:31,001 --> 02:33:32,230
interested in.
You know,

3096
02:33:32,231 --> 02:33:36,480
we're going to see jay z followed by
Johnny Cash followed by loretta lynn.

3097
02:33:36,490 --> 02:33:37,720
No,
It's not going to be that way.

3098
02:33:37,990 --> 02:33:40,450
You're gonna go to a rock and roll club.
You go to the viper room,

3099
02:33:40,451 --> 02:33:43,450
most likely gonna hear some rock and
roll and he'd go to a country western

3100
02:33:43,451 --> 02:33:43,961
bar.
You know,

3101
02:33:43,961 --> 02:33:44,794
you get to see that.

3102
02:33:45,100 --> 02:33:48,520
I think with standup comedy,
people get upset if you're not doing

3103
02:33:48,521 --> 02:33:52,000
like what appeals to them and their
sensibility.

3104
02:33:52,001 --> 02:33:55,240
So I like to go to nightclubs.
That's where I like,

3105
02:33:55,260 --> 02:33:57,130
I like,
I don't even do corporate gigs.

3106
02:33:57,280 --> 02:33:59,980
I get a lot of offers to do these
corporate gigs and they'll,

3107
02:34:00,100 --> 02:34:02,710
they'll pay you a lot of money.
There'll be to tame the audience.

3108
02:34:02,711 --> 02:34:04,570
They won't know.
It's not a,

3109
02:34:04,720 --> 02:34:07,470
it's not a real comedy show.
It's like you guys are paying.

3110
02:34:07,510 --> 02:34:10,900
It's like your gad sad paying 50 grand
to have these guys singing your

3111
02:34:10,910 --> 02:34:12,490
backyard.
Some weird ego thing,

3112
02:34:12,510 --> 02:34:15,250
right?
I saw my friend dana white,

3113
02:34:15,340 --> 02:34:18,040
who is the.
He's head of the ufc.

3114
02:34:18,220 --> 02:34:23,220
He had a birthday party years back and
stone temple pilots played for that dude

3115
02:34:23,621 --> 02:34:24,850
died of an overdose.
RIght.

3116
02:34:25,270 --> 02:34:27,850
And man,
nobody was fucking paying attention.

3117
02:34:27,910 --> 02:34:31,540
It was weird.
Stone temple pilots mean they kinda got

3118
02:34:31,541 --> 02:34:32,680
everybody to pay attention.

3119
02:34:32,700 --> 02:34:36,850
Got everybody moved towards the stage,
but people a didn't know to expect stone

3120
02:34:36,851 --> 02:34:41,020
temple pilots who was a big surprise and
when I even introduced them,

3121
02:34:41,170 --> 02:34:43,990
when I introduce stone temple pilots,
people didn't even think that it was

3122
02:34:43,991 --> 02:34:46,810
really going to be stone temple pilots.
Like I said,

3123
02:34:46,811 --> 02:34:49,420
happy birthday to dana,
thanked him for everything and then I

3124
02:34:49,421 --> 02:34:51,580
said,
and I'm going to blow your mind right

3125
02:34:51,581 --> 02:34:52,540
now.
Ladies and gentlemen,

3126
02:34:52,720 --> 02:34:55,420
stone temple pilots,
and they came out and it was really

3127
02:34:55,421 --> 02:34:57,910
stone temple pilots.
They went hard.

3128
02:34:58,120 --> 02:34:59,470
They did there.
It was really,

3129
02:34:59,471 --> 02:35:03,100
really impressive stuff because they did
their full on concert,

3130
02:35:03,310 --> 02:35:06,280
like a 100 percent all out.
it was intense.

3131
02:35:06,490 --> 02:35:09,310
It was really amazing,
but it wasn't a lot of people paying

3132
02:35:09,311 --> 02:35:10,780
attention.
And while I was,

3133
02:35:10,840 --> 02:35:12,910
while I was sitting there watching it,
I was like,

3134
02:35:12,911 --> 02:35:13,541
you know what?
Yeah,

3135
02:35:13,541 --> 02:35:15,350
never again.
I'm never doing.

3136
02:35:15,400 --> 02:35:17,410
I mean I'd already decided I wasn't
going to do it.

3137
02:35:17,680 --> 02:35:20,210
I wasn't going to do that anyway,
but I remember

3138
02:35:20,450 --> 02:35:23,670
that you said,
I think in our first chat several years

3139
02:35:23,670 --> 02:35:25,680
ago,
which has resonated and stuck with me,

3140
02:35:25,681 --> 02:35:30,681
you were comparing your career as a
standup comic or in fighting to the

3141
02:35:33,271 --> 02:35:37,200
truth that comes in science,
that you're comparing that to acting,

3142
02:35:37,201 --> 02:35:40,320
which is very ephemera and fuzzy and you
were saying basically,

3143
02:35:40,321 --> 02:35:41,730
look,
when you're a scientist,

3144
02:35:41,731 --> 02:35:44,790
you have to present stuff and it's
either right or wrong and people are

3145
02:35:44,791 --> 02:35:47,760
going to judge you and you analogized it
to comedy.

3146
02:35:47,761 --> 02:35:51,240
You get up in front of a crowd,
you either know you're either funny or

3147
02:35:51,241 --> 02:35:52,980
you're going to bomb.
You get up to fight.

3148
02:35:53,340 --> 02:35:55,740
You either are ready or are you going to
get pummeled.

3149
02:35:56,010 --> 02:35:58,890
And I thought that was a really good
analogy because there's truth and

3150
02:35:58,891 --> 02:35:59,940
honesty in that,
right?

3151
02:35:59,941 --> 02:36:01,860
There is no way to wing it.
As a comic.

3152
02:36:01,861 --> 02:36:04,340
You get up and you better be funny,

3153
02:36:04,510 --> 02:36:04,781
right?
Yeah,

3154
02:36:04,781 --> 02:36:08,080
but it's very subjective,
like one thing to make might make you

3155
02:36:08,081 --> 02:36:10,900
laugh is different.
Someone might think is terrible.

3156
02:36:10,930 --> 02:36:14,620
I mean there's a lot of people that are
fans of certain comedians that other

3157
02:36:14,621 --> 02:36:17,350
people think or how awful it just like
music,

3158
02:36:17,380 --> 02:36:18,400
you know,
there's certain types of.

3159
02:36:18,480 --> 02:36:20,200
It's all subjective.
It's,

3160
02:36:20,210 --> 02:36:25,210
it's like when you consider art,
what's really like fighting even it's

3161
02:36:25,301 --> 02:36:30,301
like who's not necessarily even who's
necessarily better.

3162
02:36:31,180 --> 02:36:34,000
SometImes it's like what happened in the
moment.

3163
02:36:34,210 --> 02:36:38,140
Sometimes dudes collide heads and it
changes the course of a fight and it's

3164
02:36:38,141 --> 02:36:42,370
not because of skill.
It's because in the moment something

3165
02:36:42,371 --> 02:36:45,970
happened chaotic or someone got poked in
the eye and they couldn't see well,

3166
02:36:46,150 --> 02:36:48,820
and then they got knocked out.
Are they the worst fighter?

3167
02:36:49,390 --> 02:36:51,880
Not necessarily.
It's like sometimes there's a.

3168
02:36:51,881 --> 02:36:56,230
There's all sorts of unpredictable
variables that come into place.

3169
02:36:56,300 --> 02:37:01,300
Here's a guy that I recently discovered.
He's an italian comedian Who had an hbo

3170
02:37:02,871 --> 02:37:04,430
special.
I thought,

3171
02:37:04,590 --> 02:37:07,050
sebastian sebastian maniscalco.
He's a buddy of mine.

3172
02:37:07,051 --> 02:37:08,620
He's been on the podcast.
No kidding.

3173
02:37:08,621 --> 02:37:09,420
Hilarious.

3174
02:37:09,420 --> 02:37:10,360
I,
I live it.

3175
02:37:10,440 --> 02:37:12,000
Usually when I watch standup comics,
I mean,

3176
02:37:12,001 --> 02:37:13,830
I'll laugh a bit.
I think this is funny that,

3177
02:37:14,100 --> 02:37:15,980
but that guy in that

3178
02:37:15,980 --> 02:37:17,840
show,
I've probably watched shows on showtime.

3179
02:37:18,020 --> 02:37:18,980
Showtime.
Yeah.

3180
02:37:19,010 --> 02:37:23,510
I literally could not stop laughing
because somehow his humor very much

3181
02:37:23,511 --> 02:37:27,580
resonated with some of our sort of
middle eastern italian.

3182
02:37:27,910 --> 02:37:30,940
Yeah.
And I just get so gravitate towards him

3183
02:37:31,330 --> 02:37:33,800
just this guy's fantastic.
He really is.

3184
02:37:33,801 --> 02:37:35,630
He's a great guy too.
He's,

3185
02:37:35,780 --> 02:37:38,450
he's like,
nobody hates that guy.

3186
02:37:38,610 --> 02:37:41,210
Like that guy is loved in the comedy
community,

3187
02:37:41,450 --> 02:37:42,283
but does he,
is he.

3188
02:37:42,830 --> 02:37:45,830
Has he been known for a long.
He's been doing it for a long time and

3189
02:37:45,831 --> 02:37:49,160
he's an interesting case because when he
first started out he wasn't doing that

3190
02:37:49,161 --> 02:37:49,851
good,
you know,

3191
02:37:49,851 --> 02:37:52,280
he had a really work hard at it to
become who he is,

3192
02:37:52,580 --> 02:37:56,360
but he stuck with it and chipped away at
it and got better and better and better.

3193
02:37:56,361 --> 02:38:00,890
And I didn't see him for a long time
because I had taken mY hiatus from the

3194
02:38:00,891 --> 02:38:05,891
comedy store and um,
I saw him on showtime when I wasn't at

3195
02:38:06,831 --> 02:38:07,820
the comedy store anymore.

3196
02:38:07,820 --> 02:38:10,450
And I thought it was so fucking funny.
I met,

3197
02:38:10,480 --> 02:38:13,340
I remember tweeting at them.
Then I got ahold of him,

3198
02:38:13,350 --> 02:38:13,881
I said,
dude,

3199
02:38:13,881 --> 02:38:15,620
that was amazing.
It's so good.

3200
02:38:15,621 --> 02:38:17,330
And I had heard that he was doing really
well,

3201
02:38:17,480 --> 02:38:22,160
but I hadn't seen him perform and it was
probably like six years,

3202
02:38:22,161 --> 02:38:24,340
five or six years at least.
And um,

3203
02:38:24,560 --> 02:38:27,470
he just had gotten so much better.
That's an eighth right.

3204
02:38:27,471 --> 02:38:30,350
You agree that much of our humor.
I mean,

3205
02:38:30,351 --> 02:38:32,570
it's not something that you could teach
and a workshop.

3206
02:38:32,600 --> 02:38:33,940
Right?
How to be funny one.

3207
02:38:33,941 --> 02:38:34,340
Oh,
one.

3208
02:38:34,340 --> 02:38:35,240
right.
It's just,

3209
02:38:35,241 --> 02:38:37,070
you either have that delivery,
you know,

3210
02:38:37,071 --> 02:38:39,620
how to.
I would say you have an ember.

3211
02:38:39,800 --> 02:38:40,633
okay.
And you,

3212
02:38:40,730 --> 02:38:42,020
if your lungs,
you have an ember,

3213
02:38:42,050 --> 02:38:44,720
you could become really funny.
But I've met a lot of people that sucked

3214
02:38:44,721 --> 02:38:47,750
in the beginning and they just got
really good.

3215
02:38:47,940 --> 02:38:49,670
They because they really worked hard at
it.

3216
02:38:49,700 --> 02:38:52,550
And here's the most important thing,
and this is like,

3217
02:38:52,580 --> 02:38:55,010
it's,
this relates to what we've been talking

3218
02:38:55,011 --> 02:38:58,790
about,
being objective about the actual root

3219
02:38:58,791 --> 02:39:02,510
cause of why people like you or don't
like you try to figure out what,

3220
02:39:03,050 --> 02:39:06,590
what it is about what you're doing that
people don't like and correct it.

3221
02:39:06,740 --> 02:39:07,610
Right.
Get better,

3222
02:39:07,611 --> 02:39:10,490
improve,
and the onlY way to improve is not blame

3223
02:39:10,491 --> 02:39:11,360
the audience.
Oh,

3224
02:39:11,361 --> 02:39:16,160
you're a bunch of sTupid,
but people do do that.

3225
02:39:16,161 --> 02:39:20,630
And the people that do make those
excuses and don't instead look

3226
02:39:20,631 --> 02:39:21,940
internally,
you know,

3227
02:39:21,941 --> 02:39:23,630
like sometimes you can have a bad side
and you got to say,

3228
02:39:23,631 --> 02:39:24,464
well,
you know what man,

3229
02:39:24,980 --> 02:39:27,410
I fucked that up.
I jusT wasn't tuned in.

3230
02:39:27,411 --> 02:39:29,570
I gotta I gotta I gotta readjust.
I got,

3231
02:39:29,660 --> 02:39:31,820
you know,
maybe I was sick that day and there's

3232
02:39:31,821 --> 02:39:34,790
always reasons necessarily,
um,

3233
02:39:34,860 --> 02:39:36,680
not,
not necessarily excuses rather,

3234
02:39:37,100 --> 02:39:40,340
but you got to examine those
uncomfortable moments and some people

3235
02:39:40,341 --> 02:39:44,210
excuse themselves by that by saying that
audience sucked or you know,

3236
02:39:44,211 --> 02:39:47,750
these people are assholes or you know,
these people are stupid.

3237
02:39:47,960 --> 02:39:51,500
There's a bunch of excuses that people
make and it's super critical that you

3238
02:39:51,501 --> 02:39:53,710
don't do that.
You've got to look at data,

3239
02:39:53,720 --> 02:39:58,220
look at the whole thing.
Do you juke in terms of actionable

3240
02:39:58,221 --> 02:40:00,290
feedback?
Do you look for it from other

3241
02:40:00,291 --> 02:40:03,560
professional comics because you trust
their opinions more?

3242
02:40:03,561 --> 02:40:07,820
Or are you looking for the civilians in
the audience to give you that feedback?

3243
02:40:07,821 --> 02:40:09,680
What?
Which one is more actionable from your

3244
02:40:09,681 --> 02:40:13,980
perspective as you're trying to improve
your craft is very problematic to play

3245
02:40:13,981 --> 02:40:16,890
for the comedians because comedians like
weird shit,

3246
02:40:17,160 --> 02:40:20,970
like we might like something completely
obscure that we don't see common,

3247
02:40:21,330 --> 02:40:24,330
you know,
but an audience might not be laughing

3248
02:40:24,331 --> 02:40:29,331
and you might hear one comment in the
back of their own fucking ridiculous and

3249
02:40:29,550 --> 02:40:32,940
the audience doesn't think it's funny
and then there's a trap that the

3250
02:40:32,941 --> 02:40:37,941
comedians will fall into with a start
playing for their peers specifically.

3251
02:40:38,790 --> 02:40:42,420
There's a bunch of guys that have,
I don't want to call anybody out,

3252
02:40:42,421 --> 02:40:45,330
but there's people that have ruined
their career because they essentially

3253
02:40:45,331 --> 02:40:49,860
became the comic place to the back of
the room and the audience didn't think

3254
02:40:49,861 --> 02:40:53,850
they were funny and essentially they're
making fun of people who try to be funny

3255
02:40:54,480 --> 02:40:59,480
and instead exonerating themselves for
many real pressure to be funny because

3256
02:40:59,671 --> 02:41:01,380
hey,
I'm here to make comics laugh.

3257
02:41:01,381 --> 02:41:02,910
I'm a comic's comic.
Right?

3258
02:41:03,330 --> 02:41:05,230
Well,
the real comics are comics comp,

3259
02:41:05,231 --> 02:41:10,050
like dave chappelle's a comic's comic,
but he kills the audience too because

3260
02:41:10,051 --> 02:41:13,230
he's real.
He's got the full package where there's

3261
02:41:13,231 --> 02:41:16,590
a lot of comics that bomb in front of
the audience,

3262
02:41:16,591 --> 02:41:20,540
but you'll have 20 guys in the back of
the room that think it's cool to chuckle

3263
02:41:20,541 --> 02:41:25,541
at obscure references and very bizarre
words that get used in some sort of

3264
02:41:25,681 --> 02:41:27,630
strange weather would be sort of like
that,

3265
02:41:27,631 --> 02:41:27,870
right.

3266
02:41:27,870 --> 02:41:30,750
Because he,
just to follow his references takes you

3267
02:41:30,751 --> 02:41:33,030
like a flow chart of 20 pages long.
Right.

3268
02:41:33,120 --> 02:41:34,640
I talked to norm mcdonald about him
once.

3269
02:41:34,641 --> 02:41:35,281
It was really funny.
It was.

3270
02:41:35,281 --> 02:41:35,851
Yeah.
You know,

3271
02:41:35,851 --> 02:41:37,350
uh,
he's not really that smart.

3272
02:41:37,470 --> 02:41:39,480
Has really know those words.
Like a one.

3273
02:41:39,660 --> 02:41:40,890
Yeah,
that's crazy.

3274
02:41:41,310 --> 02:41:44,040
He just,
he just finds out words that people

3275
02:41:44,041 --> 02:41:47,130
don't know and he uses them and uh,
people laugh even though they don't know

3276
02:41:47,131 --> 02:41:50,340
what he's talking about.
So someone played a joke on him once

3277
02:41:50,640 --> 02:41:55,640
where they use some reference.
They use some refereNce on Dennis Miller

3278
02:41:56,221 --> 02:41:57,210
that they made up.
oh,

3279
02:41:57,211 --> 02:42:00,360
it was dom.
I rera used a reference on Dennis Miller

3280
02:42:00,361 --> 02:42:04,380
that he's fade up and dennis started
laughing at it even though it wasn't

3281
02:42:04,381 --> 02:42:06,780
real because it was like something that
you had to be like,

3282
02:42:06,781 --> 02:42:11,770
cool to know tom to remember that door.
But he was like his,

3283
02:42:11,820 --> 02:42:12,451
like,
he goes,

3284
02:42:12,451 --> 02:42:13,950
I fucked him with his own thing.

3285
02:42:16,020 --> 02:42:18,090
I tricked him with his own trick.
I,

3286
02:42:18,170 --> 02:42:22,830
he just used a reference that isn't real
and he just can't,

3287
02:42:22,850 --> 02:42:25,350
you
know,

3288
02:42:25,380 --> 02:42:27,450
because people don't like to be on the
outside.

3289
02:42:27,451 --> 02:42:29,460
Like people don't like to say what the
fuck does that mean?

3290
02:42:29,820 --> 02:42:31,620
I'm a big fan of saying what does that
mean?

3291
02:42:31,621 --> 02:42:33,300
Yeah.
Because I look,

3292
02:42:33,900 --> 02:42:38,900
I've had 900 plus podcast with 700
people wave fucking smarter than me.

3293
02:42:39,120 --> 02:42:41,510
So like I have to say,
I don't knoW what that means.

3294
02:42:41,540 --> 02:42:44,670
Like you got to be mean.
But there's a weird thing where people

3295
02:42:44,671 --> 02:42:49,410
don't like to,
they equate not having information with

3296
02:42:49,411 --> 02:42:51,630
somehow and they're being less
intelligent,

3297
02:42:51,690 --> 02:42:53,990
which is a really bizarre thing because
like,

3298
02:42:54,300 --> 02:42:57,420
it's okay if you're talking to someone
about something that you couldn't

3299
02:42:57,421 --> 02:42:59,520
possibly have data on,
like a,

3300
02:42:59,580 --> 02:43:01,770
you know,
whatever.

3301
02:43:01,771 --> 02:43:02,970
A video game,
right,

3302
02:43:02,971 --> 02:43:04,560
that you don't play,
like what's it about?

3303
02:43:04,560 --> 02:43:06,180
Like how's it go?
Like that's okay,

3304
02:43:06,181 --> 02:43:08,430
that's fine,
but as soon as it's something about like

3305
02:43:08,460 --> 02:43:11,740
some sort of cultural reference or
perhaps a book that maybe you should

3306
02:43:11,830 --> 02:43:14,200
have initiatives you to admit that you
don't know.

3307
02:43:14,290 --> 02:43:15,880
That's a weird damn.
You know,

3308
02:43:15,881 --> 02:43:18,280
it's a weird thing to be somehow or
another,

3309
02:43:18,290 --> 02:43:20,800
you feel diminished by information or a
lack of it.

3310
02:43:20,801 --> 02:43:25,801
It's so funny that you say this because
in my classes students will oftentimes

3311
02:43:26,230 --> 02:43:29,400
ask me a question and that has me
stumped and I will usually answer it.

3312
02:43:29,410 --> 02:43:31,060
You know what?
I actually don't know the answer.

3313
02:43:31,210 --> 02:43:33,010
Could you send me an email so I could
look it up?

3314
02:43:33,160 --> 02:43:36,730
That's beautiful.
And they are really impressed by that.

3315
02:43:36,731 --> 02:43:39,230
Honesty Was impressive.
Yeah.

3316
02:43:39,320 --> 02:43:40,390
Yeah.
So I hear you.

3317
02:43:40,391 --> 02:43:42,130
Yeah.
It's about the military I guess.

3318
02:43:42,370 --> 02:43:44,710
But on the other hand,
when I know something,

3319
02:43:45,130 --> 02:43:48,100
I come out with the bravado of I know my
shit,

3320
02:43:48,110 --> 02:43:48,943
right?

3321
02:43:49,100 --> 02:43:51,610
So have the,
have the humility to know what you know

3322
02:43:51,611 --> 02:43:53,320
and what you don't know as the old
saying says,

3323
02:43:53,321 --> 02:43:55,010
you know,
well you have um,

3324
02:43:55,550 --> 02:43:56,140
the,
that,

3325
02:43:56,140 --> 02:43:59,830
what you would say bravado.
It's like a pride of hard work.

3326
02:43:59,860 --> 02:44:04,720
I mean you've accumulated a massive
amount of knowledge of from seeking this

3327
02:44:04,721 --> 02:44:07,480
knowledge and studying very hard.
So it's something that you should be

3328
02:44:07,481 --> 02:44:10,600
proud of,
but it's not something that you look at.

3329
02:44:10,601 --> 02:44:13,570
Like when you're proud of it,
you're not diminishing other people that

3330
02:44:13,571 --> 02:44:15,510
don't have that information.
You're just saying like,

3331
02:44:15,610 --> 02:44:17,860
this is what I know to be true and this
is a fact.

3332
02:44:17,861 --> 02:44:20,410
This is undeniable.
But that's a beautiful thing that you

3333
02:44:20,411 --> 02:44:22,720
could also say,
I don't know about something that you

3334
02:44:22,721 --> 02:44:23,650
don't know,
right?

3335
02:44:23,770 --> 02:44:26,350
That will give the people that are
listening,

3336
02:44:26,560 --> 02:44:30,120
that will give them so much more of a
sense of respect for you venture than

3337
02:44:30,490 --> 02:44:34,210
horse shooting around and pretending
that's such a weird thing that people

3338
02:44:34,211 --> 02:44:34,750
do.

3339
02:44:34,750 --> 02:44:36,520
And by the way,
the media,

3340
02:44:36,970 --> 02:44:41,500
oftentimes they want you to weigh in on
things as a scientist,

3341
02:44:41,501 --> 02:44:44,770
which you don't feel that your area of
expertise would allow you to and they

3342
02:44:44,771 --> 02:44:48,160
get frustrated because then they feel as
though you're equivocating.

3343
02:44:48,190 --> 02:44:49,001
But I said,
look,

3344
02:44:49,001 --> 02:44:51,250
I'm sorry,
but I'm not willing to make that

3345
02:44:51,251 --> 02:44:52,960
statement.
Would that level of certainty,

3346
02:44:53,020 --> 02:44:55,600
but they want it because that's what the
headline has to say.

3347
02:44:55,990 --> 02:44:58,330
And then they get frustrated that you're
tippy toeing,

3348
02:44:58,570 --> 02:45:02,410
but I'm just being humble about what is
true and what I don't think I'm

3349
02:45:02,470 --> 02:45:04,310
knowledgeable enough to say it's true.
Yeah.

3350
02:45:04,380 --> 02:45:09,130
I've had people get upset at me about.
I'm talking about a upcoming martial

3351
02:45:09,131 --> 02:45:12,340
arts fights because a,
I don't give predictions.

3352
02:45:12,341 --> 02:45:13,270
I very,
very,

3353
02:45:13,271 --> 02:45:17,100
very rarely give predictions unless
there's some gross mismatch.

3354
02:45:17,101 --> 02:45:20,380
It really shouldn't be happening in the
first place because you really have no

3355
02:45:20,381 --> 02:45:21,450
idea what's going to happen.

3356
02:45:21,470 --> 02:45:24,130
There's a high likelihood that something
might happen.

3357
02:45:24,131 --> 02:45:29,131
If I look at the way one guy moves
versus another guy moves and I go into

3358
02:45:29,531 --> 02:45:34,531
my database of experiences of seeing a
lot of live competition and knowing what

3359
02:45:36,251 --> 02:45:39,130
one person is capable of,
I can make.

3360
02:45:40,090 --> 02:45:43,960
I can make a statement with reasonable
certainty,

3361
02:45:44,230 --> 02:45:46,780
but I don't know if they were injured in
training.

3362
02:45:46,840 --> 02:45:48,490
I don't know if they come into the fight
sick.

3363
02:45:48,670 --> 02:45:50,770
I don't know if they're breaking up with
their girlfriend.

3364
02:45:50,950 --> 02:45:55,060
I don't know if they got staph infection
two weeks before the fight and run ended

3365
02:45:55,061 --> 02:45:57,190
up biotics.
There's so many variables.

3366
02:45:57,340 --> 02:45:59,830
I don't know if they might get
headbutted like we've talked about

3367
02:45:59,831 --> 02:46:03,340
earlier or they might have an injury
like in the middle of the fight,

3368
02:46:03,341 --> 02:46:05,530
like something goes wrong and their knee
blows out.

3369
02:46:05,531 --> 02:46:08,470
There's so many variables.
Has the thing between the boxer and the

3370
02:46:08,471 --> 02:46:09,630
mma guy happened yet?

3371
02:46:10,510 --> 02:46:11,300
See,
thIs is.

3372
02:46:11,300 --> 02:46:13,820
I love when someone.
I know.

3373
02:46:13,821 --> 02:46:15,240
I love that though.
I know I'm not.

3374
02:46:15,241 --> 02:46:17,720
I'm not criticizing you,
but I love when someone is so far

3375
02:46:17,721 --> 02:46:20,330
removed,
but they're still aware of something

3376
02:46:20,331 --> 02:46:22,520
that's like a big cultural event.
No,

3377
02:46:22,521 --> 02:46:25,940
it takes place August 26th.
I think even I,

3378
02:46:25,941 --> 02:46:28,640
I'm an unbelievable novice when it comes
to this stuff.

3379
02:46:28,730 --> 02:46:33,020
I think I could make a prediction here
in front of your huge podcast that the

3380
02:46:33,021 --> 02:46:35,060
mma guys going to get trashed.
Correct.

3381
02:46:35,520 --> 02:46:39,110
Um,
I would imagine that most likely he is

3382
02:46:39,111 --> 02:46:43,790
going to lose a boxing match to the
boxer that has every little.

3383
02:46:43,791 --> 02:46:45,540
What's the point of this fight?
Just for,

3384
02:46:45,760 --> 02:46:49,130
for my name thIng,
if you wanted to see a figure skater

3385
02:46:49,131 --> 02:46:52,440
play hockey against wayne gretzky.
okay.

3386
02:46:52,510 --> 02:46:57,380
So why would the mma guy put himself up
for that potential humiliation,

3387
02:46:57,381 --> 02:47:00,740
money,
dollar dollar bills.

3388
02:47:00,741 --> 02:47:02,210
Y'all been on your show?

3389
02:47:02,270 --> 02:47:03,170
No,
he has not.

3390
02:47:03,171 --> 02:47:05,210
I fucked up.
I should have had them on back before he

3391
02:47:05,211 --> 02:47:07,310
blew up.
He's too big now.

3392
02:47:07,670 --> 02:47:10,140
I refer to him as a conrad last time or
something.

3393
02:47:10,150 --> 02:47:13,280
Right?
Something like that.

3394
02:47:13,760 --> 02:47:15,680
His name's connor.
Connor mcgregor.

3395
02:47:15,800 --> 02:47:16,730
Yeah.
Um,

3396
02:47:16,880 --> 02:47:17,713
I,
uh,

3397
02:47:17,900 --> 02:47:20,780
he's a,
a real meteoric,

3398
02:47:20,860 --> 02:47:24,830
a entity and like the most media or can
all of combat sports.

3399
02:47:24,950 --> 02:47:27,960
He became so famous so quick and for
[inaudible],

3400
02:47:28,030 --> 02:47:30,450
he's a,
he's a real unicorn in a lot of ways.

3401
02:47:30,490 --> 02:47:32,840
Get so many different things going for
him.

3402
02:47:33,260 --> 02:47:35,540
Handsome guy,
brutal knockout artists,

3403
02:47:35,541 --> 02:47:38,780
predicts outcomes and pulls them off
and,

3404
02:47:39,290 --> 02:47:41,600
and uh,
has been incredibly successful in a

3405
02:47:41,601 --> 02:47:42,920
short period of time.
One,

3406
02:47:42,921 --> 02:47:47,600
two world titles in two different weight
classes and is arguably the greatest

3407
02:47:47,601 --> 02:47:50,540
trash talker ever.
He trashed talks better than anybody

3408
02:47:50,600 --> 02:47:54,020
because that right there is actually a
big thing that's going on today,

3409
02:47:54,021 --> 02:47:54,380
right?

3410
02:47:54,380 --> 02:47:56,370
The press conference or actually I'm
reading the thing,

3411
02:47:56,371 --> 02:48:00,770
they're scalping tickets outside of it
for 40 bucks right now to my 40.

3412
02:48:00,800 --> 02:48:01,820
It's a free.
It was free.

3413
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:04,340
Oh,
my nephew is probably all over that

3414
02:48:04,341 --> 02:48:05,090
stuff,
right?

3415
02:48:05,090 --> 02:48:06,210
Probably.
Yeah.

3416
02:48:06,250 --> 02:48:07,720
Yeah.
It's um,

3417
02:48:08,410 --> 02:48:10,790
it's um,
it's the press conference itself will be

3418
02:48:10,791 --> 02:48:15,620
a show because this guy is so good at
getting people riled up and talk and

3419
02:48:15,650 --> 02:48:17,330
shit.
And that's half the fun.

3420
02:48:17,331 --> 02:48:21,470
Like I was too young to appreciate the
mohammed ali days,

3421
02:48:21,500 --> 02:48:25,760
but I would imagine that when muhammad
ali was challenging sonny liston,

3422
02:48:25,761 --> 02:48:29,480
like half of the fun was mohammed ali
talk and shit.

3423
02:48:29,481 --> 02:48:30,770
Like,
this guy's crazy.

3424
02:48:31,060 --> 02:48:36,060
That's exactly the mechanism When I take
on some random person online and I just

3425
02:48:36,441 --> 02:48:39,590
have fun with it.
Sometimes people miss understand this to

3426
02:48:39,591 --> 02:48:41,150
be.
I'm getting pissed.

3427
02:48:41,390 --> 02:48:43,310
I'm just happy.
I'm just doing bantering.

3428
02:48:43,340 --> 02:48:45,800
I'm usually doing this with a smile on
my face,

3429
02:48:46,070 --> 02:48:47,510
but they think of it as though I'm.

3430
02:48:47,590 --> 02:48:49,490
But I'm just trash talking about.
Yeah.

3431
02:48:49,870 --> 02:48:50,930
Yeah.
It's a weird thing,

3432
02:48:50,931 --> 02:48:53,600
man.
It's like engaging with people you don't

3433
02:48:53,601 --> 02:48:55,760
know.
Like sometimes that person's insane and

3434
02:48:55,761 --> 02:49:00,080
then they'll make it a career to go
after god sat all day long.

3435
02:49:00,081 --> 02:49:04,910
It's like
it's interacting with people in text

3436
02:49:04,911 --> 02:49:07,120
form is very problematic.
Right?

3437
02:49:07,190 --> 02:49:09,110
It's just like a lot of issues.
You don't,

3438
02:49:09,111 --> 02:49:11,310
you don't get social cues.
You can adjust.

3439
02:49:11,340 --> 02:49:12,330
You can't,
you know,

3440
02:49:12,331 --> 02:49:16,260
like in our conversation we're kind of
going back and forth and you say

3441
02:49:16,261 --> 02:49:20,520
something and I react to it and we laugh
and we see eaCh other.

3442
02:49:20,790 --> 02:49:23,190
all that's missing.
When you're writing things,

3443
02:49:23,250 --> 02:49:26,040
you know,
especially if someone like writes a blog

3444
02:49:26,041 --> 02:49:27,540
about you.
If somebody listens to what you've said

3445
02:49:27,541 --> 02:49:30,450
on this podcast and they write a blog
about you defining you,

3446
02:49:30,600 --> 02:49:35,490
he Is a man that does this.
His whole career is this and you read

3447
02:49:35,491 --> 02:49:35,580
it.

3448
02:49:35,580 --> 02:49:39,300
Like sam harris was just explaining
something to me that someone did about

3449
02:49:39,301 --> 02:49:41,160
him and uh,
I read it and I was like,

3450
02:49:41,161 --> 02:49:44,310
wow,
this is such a weird way to describe and

3451
02:49:44,311 --> 02:49:47,760
interact with the person that you've
never even met credible to write a one

3452
02:49:47,761 --> 02:49:50,160
sided thing where you don't even know
the guy.

3453
02:49:50,370 --> 02:49:52,170
You don't really know him,
like really know him.

3454
02:49:52,230 --> 02:49:53,150
Like,
you know,

3455
02:49:53,250 --> 02:49:54,780
you've,
you've seen some videos,

3456
02:49:54,900 --> 02:49:59,370
maybe the excuse me to interrupt and
that you would muster such animus

3457
02:49:59,820 --> 02:50:01,710
towards a person that you haven't met.
Right?

3458
02:50:01,711 --> 02:50:02,071
I mean,
I,

3459
02:50:02,071 --> 02:50:03,720
I'm,
I'm fortunate enough to not have too

3460
02:50:03,721 --> 02:50:07,410
many of these haters and trolls,
but there is one or two guys that have

3461
02:50:07,740 --> 02:50:11,730
come to my attention that it seems as
though they spend 90 percent of their

3462
02:50:11,731 --> 02:50:14,970
day doing.
He trashed stuff about me and you think,

3463
02:50:15,140 --> 02:50:20,140
what could it be that I could so trigger
in them that they would construe it as a

3464
02:50:20,821 --> 02:50:24,810
valuable use of their time to take on
someone whom they've never even met.

3465
02:50:25,140 --> 02:50:29,910
But somehow they're pissed at you and
they think it's a worthwhile cause to

3466
02:50:30,270 --> 02:50:31,600
trash talk you all that.
Well,

3467
02:50:31,601 --> 02:50:34,230
that's a weird thing,
like even if they have a valid point,

3468
02:50:34,231 --> 02:50:38,430
there becomes some sort of weird
symbiotic slash parasitic relationship

3469
02:50:38,730 --> 02:50:42,810
with the person that you're criticized,
like you are inexorably connected to

3470
02:50:42,811 --> 02:50:44,280
them.
They are your enemy.

3471
02:50:44,281 --> 02:50:48,900
You think about them all the time and by
virtue that you become part of them or

3472
02:50:48,901 --> 02:50:52,350
they become part of you.
That's the weird thing about thinking,

3473
02:50:52,380 --> 02:50:55,250
right?
like when you're on stage and you are

3474
02:50:55,260 --> 02:50:58,080
giving a lecture,
one of the more amazing things that

3475
02:50:58,081 --> 02:51:01,980
happens when someone is on stage talking
about something is you allow them to

3476
02:51:01,981 --> 02:51:05,520
kind of think for you in the sense that
when you are,

3477
02:51:05,730 --> 02:51:08,610
and that's one of the reasons why it's
so important to be articulate and so

3478
02:51:08,611 --> 02:51:13,611
important to be very aware of what
you're going to say in advance.

3479
02:51:13,950 --> 02:51:17,580
the point where it comes out smoothly
and there's good entertainment value to

3480
02:51:17,581 --> 02:51:20,500
it,
is that it's pleasing to listen to it

3481
02:51:20,501 --> 02:51:24,240
for you.
You're aware of how annoying certain

3482
02:51:24,241 --> 02:51:27,210
speech patterns can be and you avoid
those.

3483
02:51:27,390 --> 02:51:30,020
you're aware of how compelling are the
speech patterns can be new.

3484
02:51:30,021 --> 02:51:33,180
Embrace those and so it makes it
pleasing for the person to listen to so

3485
02:51:33,181 --> 02:51:37,350
they can just sit back and listen to you
talk about evolutionary psychology.

3486
02:51:37,560 --> 02:51:41,100
Whereas when a person sucks at it,
it's like grading.

3487
02:51:41,101 --> 02:51:43,140
It's painful.
It gets in your head.

3488
02:51:43,150 --> 02:51:46,020
You're not connected with them,
you're not allowing them to think about

3489
02:51:46,080 --> 02:51:46,913
for you.
Right.

3490
02:51:47,140 --> 02:51:47,800
There's,
there's,

3491
02:51:47,800 --> 02:51:51,090
that happens with comedy too,
like when someone is really good,

3492
02:51:51,091 --> 02:51:54,540
like you see it like a great comic,
like a louis c care,

3493
02:51:54,541 --> 02:51:56,630
someone like that.
when he's on stage and he's,

3494
02:51:56,800 --> 02:51:57,900
he's really in the groove.

3495
02:51:58,050 --> 02:51:59,850
You're kind of allowing him to think for
you.

3496
02:52:00,120 --> 02:52:04,230
You're like letting him take the reins
of your imagination and your mind and

3497
02:52:04,231 --> 02:52:06,160
your visualization.
But boy,

3498
02:52:06,161 --> 02:52:08,110
it must be a tough job because I always
think,

3499
02:52:08,530 --> 02:52:11,410
what if you just had a fight with your
wife?

3500
02:52:11,500 --> 02:52:16,150
I've had that before piss right?
But in 10 minutes I don't give a shit

3501
02:52:16,151 --> 02:52:18,220
about your fight.
You have to perform.

3502
02:52:18,221 --> 02:52:20,710
Right.
What kind of comedy you have?

3503
02:52:20,711 --> 02:52:23,440
Like if you're sam kennison,
it's probably better because your ankle

3504
02:52:23,441 --> 02:52:24,710
onstage,
you fuck.

3505
02:52:26,200 --> 02:52:28,630
Like he would go onstage probably angry,
pumped.

3506
02:52:28,631 --> 02:52:30,250
I mean,
it really depends on what you're trying

3507
02:52:30,251 --> 02:52:33,780
to do and it also depends on like what
the fight was about whether or not you

3508
02:52:33,781 --> 02:52:38,781
were wrong or she was wrong.
I would be way better off going onstage

3509
02:52:39,310 --> 02:52:42,170
if someone wronged me versus if I'm
wrong.

3510
02:52:42,400 --> 02:52:43,640
Deb,
you have I wrong.

3511
02:52:43,650 --> 02:52:45,850
Someone.
Yeah.

3512
02:52:45,880 --> 02:52:47,620
that's intrusive.
Thoughts in your head.

3513
02:52:47,630 --> 02:52:48,250
Okay.
Yeah.

3514
02:52:48,250 --> 02:52:49,930
Remorse.
Yeah.

3515
02:52:49,931 --> 02:52:52,270
Just in,
in reexamining your own behavior

3516
02:52:52,271 --> 02:52:55,060
patterns and finding fault.
Numb and just fine.

3517
02:52:55,180 --> 02:52:57,310
That's,
that's the last thing I ever want to do

3518
02:52:57,311 --> 02:53:00,280
is treat someone wrong and then go on
stage.

3519
02:53:00,430 --> 02:53:02,600
But if someone treated me like shit and
then went on stage,

3520
02:53:03,070 --> 02:53:06,000
I probably feel exonerated.
You know,

3521
02:53:06,001 --> 02:53:08,800
I'd feel like I'd feel I'd probably be
energized,

3522
02:53:08,950 --> 02:53:10,030
you know?
Interesting.

3523
02:53:10,120 --> 02:53:12,460
Very interesting.
I'm not sure what,

3524
02:53:12,461 --> 02:53:13,900
how much time we have left.
We're done.

3525
02:53:13,901 --> 02:53:15,490
It's too.
We did three hours.

3526
02:53:15,491 --> 02:53:17,650
Is crazy.
Unbelievable.

3527
02:53:17,830 --> 02:53:20,420
Next time we'll talk about,
because you mentioned red.

3528
02:53:20,710 --> 02:53:22,470
I guess it's related to regret.
Yeah.

3529
02:53:22,510 --> 02:53:25,000
We'll talk about the pSychology of
regret.

3530
02:53:25,090 --> 02:53:26,770
Psychology of regret.
Old.

3531
02:53:26,790 --> 02:53:28,230
Smart.
All right.

3532
02:53:28,300 --> 02:53:29,500
Always a pleasure,
my friend.

3533
02:53:29,501 --> 02:53:30,311
Thank you.
Really,

3534
02:53:30,311 --> 02:53:32,530
really enjoyed this conversation.
Thank you so much.

3535
02:53:32,680 --> 02:53:35,140
