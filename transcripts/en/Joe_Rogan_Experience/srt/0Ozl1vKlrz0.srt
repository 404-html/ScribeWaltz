1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,610
We are good.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,090
We are alive.

3
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:03,923
Fuck yeah.

4
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:04,930

00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:06,570

That's my laptop.

10
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:15,373
Been doing this forever.

11
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,640
Never shut that fucking thing off in time.

12
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,420
Is it okay buddy?

13
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,140
Right?

14
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:21,973
It's all right.

15
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:24,530
Especially if you're in Houston.

16
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,083
I can never,

17
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,290
is that what you're promoted?

18
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:30,470
Especially if you in Houston at the
Improv this weekends and like Brian

19
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:31,323
[inaudible],

20
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:32,780
I am the worst.

21
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:33,920
We're going to talk about it.

22
00:00:33,921 --> 00:00:35,390
You're going to help me
with my self promotion.

23
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:36,231
Well,

24
00:00:36,231 --> 00:00:37,190
you're not bad out of it.

25
00:00:37,191 --> 00:00:38,120
You just don't do it.

26
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,290
You just get lazy.

27
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:40,131
I just get,

28
00:00:40,131 --> 00:00:40,551
I just like,

29
00:00:40,551 --> 00:00:41,080
what am I gay?

30
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,730
Everybody come into Houston Improv Friday,

31
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:43,731
Saturday and Sunday.

32
00:00:43,731 --> 00:00:44,780
This Friday,

33
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:44,780
Saturday,

34
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:44,781

00:00:46,731 --> 00:00:47,930
Friday two shows Saturday.

37
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,370
That's absolutely the wrong way to do it.

38
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:49,480
Oh,

39
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:49,770
sorry.

40
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,500
Is it I need you to help me.

41
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:52,431
It doesn't matter.

42
00:00:52,431 --> 00:00:55,220
As long as you just say just a
little bit of the lower register.

43
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,240
I'm going to be very funny.

44
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,200
Old Lady is,

45
00:00:57,201 --> 00:00:59,480
is just trying to get someone
to come see something.

46
00:00:59,481 --> 00:01:00,314
Awesome.

47
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,010
Thank you.

48
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:01,301
And I'm,

49
00:01:01,301 --> 00:01:01,850
I'm very,

50
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:02,860
I'm very proud of my,

51
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:03,340
my,

52
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,400
my current one hour.

53
00:01:04,401 --> 00:01:05,250
It's coming together very.

54
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,910
You killed me when we're
working in Toronto.

55
00:01:07,911 --> 00:01:09,220
Had a great fucking time.

56
00:01:09,221 --> 00:01:10,160
It was really fun.

57
00:01:10,161 --> 00:01:11,570
It's a girl killed me too.

58
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:12,710
He's funny.

59
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:16,160
Well I was saying as the query did my
podcast yesterday and I was saying to him,

60
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:16,761
dude,

61
00:01:16,761 --> 00:01:18,230
you're one of the few people you know,

62
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:18,621
look,

63
00:01:18,621 --> 00:01:19,371
I've been doing it a long time.

64
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:19,851
I did.

65
00:01:19,851 --> 00:01:20,684
We had a great time,

66
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,520
but I got to move around.

67
00:01:22,521 --> 00:01:23,990
I'm pulling rabbits out of a hat,

68
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:24,280
you know,

69
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,310
cigrow can stand still and just
one place and crush a role.

70
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:29,750
Like he just stands there.

71
00:01:29,751 --> 00:01:30,950
Like he's really good.

72
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,110
He's great going really good.

73
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,330
I'm good.

74
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:33,530
I'm in the way of your promotion.

75
00:01:33,531 --> 00:01:33,990
Let's go.

76
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,070
I know it's such a big deal this weekend,

77
00:01:37,071 --> 00:01:38,270
Friday,

78
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:38,270
Saturday,

79
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:38,271
Sunday,

80
00:01:38,271 --> 00:01:42,990
Brian Collins and the kid
Callen clarity will end ends.

81
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:43,910
This is the audience.

82
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,640
Hopefully they're laughing.

83
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,253
They're like,

84
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,740
you're friends with Joe Rogan,

85
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,330
so it was brought to you by stamps.com
if you have a business and you do it from

86
00:01:57,331 --> 00:01:57,721
your home,

87
00:01:57,721 --> 00:02:00,420
stamps.com is an excellent
resource for you.

88
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,500
It allows you to like say if
you're sending things out,

89
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:08,340
like Brian sends those death squad
tee shirts out through death squad.tv.

90
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,780
Those are all his,

91
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,070
his artwork.

92
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:15,090
He makes himself and he sends them all
himself with stamps.com super easy to do.

93
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,540
You weigh out what you're sending a year.

94
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:22,410
You have a a computer scale that they
give you a digital scale they give you

95
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:23,244
with uh,

96
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:23,940
this,

97
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,110
this code j r.

98
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:25,300
E.

99
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:30,300
It's $110 offer that it gives you $55
of free postage and a digital scale and

100
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,950
you can just print the postage stuff
right off of your home computer.

101
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,960
You put it on your package,

102
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,160
the post man comes,

103
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,540
he takes it and you're done.

104
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:40,080
It's crazy.

105
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,410
It's,

106
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,400
it's actual like postal stamp.

107
00:02:42,401 --> 00:02:43,234
I've never done that.

108
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,520
I've got to start doing that.

109
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:44,791
Well,

110
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,920
it's a great thing if you
send things frequently.

111
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,450
It's really amazing.

112
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,580
If you send thing frequency it frequently,

113
00:02:50,581 --> 00:02:53,570
it keeps you from having to do that thing
where you go to the post office knew

114
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,420
Wayne Line,

115
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,313
oh my God,

116
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,960
and there's 10 people like you in front
of you and that lady does not want to

117
00:02:57,961 --> 00:02:58,794
have none of this.

118
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,950
She's not pleasant.

119
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,590
It's just not,

120
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:03,740
I'm just waiting for
politics to become con.

121
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm just waiting for one candidate to
get elected because he was able to do it

122
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:11,710
through social media from his garage and
not have to rely on the power structure

123
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:12,544
of fundraising,

124
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,470
but it's probably going to happen,

125
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:18,190
but I don't know what the fuck that
let's do@stamps.com why Jesus Christ.

126
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:19,120
She just went crazy.

127
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:20,600
It's Fox News on May hats.

128
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,330
Dot Fox News.

129
00:03:22,331 --> 00:03:24,400
The opposite was Rt.

130
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,310
I dunno if our teas the opposite.

131
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:28,091
What's the opposite?

132
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:29,260
It's not CNBC,

133
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,090
right?

134
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,240
I think Fox News is guilty of anybody
as anybody else having an ideology and

135
00:03:34,241 --> 00:03:35,520
being unfair in the way they,

136
00:03:35,521 --> 00:03:35,980
they,

137
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:36,640
they,

138
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,473
you know,

139
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:38,340
couch things.

140
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,140
In my opinion,

141
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,420
use the code word GRE.

142
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,120
It's 110 bucks off stamps.com by the way,

143
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:44,200
the Joe Rogan experience.

144
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:49,740
So if your phone son Joe Rogan experience
podcast does not support nor indoors,

145
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:54,700
the wacky ideas and Mr Kellen promotes
stamps.com does not without a doubt,

146
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:58,420
does not support nor
acknowledge the wacky ideas.

147
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,480
Mr Kellen was talking about some
sort of overthrowing the government.

148
00:04:01,481 --> 00:04:05,800
We don't know what it was there to sell
packages and let you do it through the

149
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:06,580
fucking email.

150
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,450
Join my order.

151
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,210
Use the code word Jerry,

152
00:04:09,211 --> 00:04:11,050
stamps.com excellent,

153
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,070
excellent service.

154
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,540
We're also brought to you by legal zoom.

155
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:14,590
Another excellent service.

156
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,800
I don't know Bryan County have ever been
involved in anything like starting up

157
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:19,790
your own corporation or writing got,

158
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,330
we'll have him just start at one.

159
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,170
Just started one for
the fighter and the kid.

160
00:04:23,171 --> 00:04:25,030
Another podcast I have on Fox,

161
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,670
which Brendan Shop I ever stop.

162
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,460
I don't play around.

163
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,520
I talk UFC and we're crushing it on Fox,

164
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:34,690
the fighter and the kid.

165
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,524
This is insane.

166
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,180
Keeps calling you have too much success.

167
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,470
I had to incorporate because
we're going to make us sick.

168
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,170
Someone's success in your life.

169
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:41,441
Thank you,

170
00:04:41,441 --> 00:04:42,130
dude.

171
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,080
Bought a new car too.

172
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,463
Oh yeah.

173
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,011
Folks.

174
00:04:45,011 --> 00:04:45,570
Wagon facade,

175
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:45,920
TD,

176
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,960
high turbo diesel,

177
00:04:46,961 --> 00:04:47,920
40 miles to the gallon.

178
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:48,880
That's car I've ever had.

179
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:49,750
Very solid.

180
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,650
You make me so sad.

181
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:51,933
Anyway,

182
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,410
legal zoom.com

183
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,040
you can incorporate it form an LLC.

184
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,510
Started getting 99 bucks.

185
00:04:59,210 --> 00:04:59,770
You can.

186
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:00,940
You can make a will.

187
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:05,440
You can protect your family assets with
a will from legal zoom for 69 bucks.

188
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,281
That's crazy,

189
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:06,431
dude.

190
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:06,791
Hold on.

191
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:07,151
You can.

192
00:05:07,151 --> 00:05:08,860
You can start an incorporation.

193
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,500
I paid $1,300 to
incorporate and legal zoom.

194
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:12,190
You can do it for,

195
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:12,920
you can do it at,

196
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,920
it starts at $100 Oh my God.

197
00:05:14,921 --> 00:05:15,754
Yeah.

198
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,680
You can get a will for 69 bucks.

199
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:18,663
It's amazing.

200
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,770
There's a lot of shit that you
would normally have had to do.

201
00:05:20,771 --> 00:05:21,070
I mean,

202
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,890
there's a lot of things that you may
still have to do with the lawyer.

203
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,480
Did they have staff
that can help you then?

204
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,110
They do.

205
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,430
This is one of the beautiful things.

206
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,300
If you,

207
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,790
if you get to a certain point
and you're going through this,

208
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:31,743
which by the way,

209
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,390
Brian used it more than once.

210
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:34,961
Okay,

211
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:36,240
so I read Pan Fry bread.

212
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,950
It's funny how you're like Brian and Ryan.

213
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,793
Here's Dad.

214
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:39,461
Listen,

215
00:05:39,461 --> 00:05:40,930
Brian will tell you he's not,

216
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:41,321
you know,

217
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:41,521
the,

218
00:05:41,521 --> 00:05:41,811
the,

219
00:05:41,811 --> 00:05:44,380
the most studious or
well-read young man on earth.

220
00:05:44,381 --> 00:05:44,650
He's,

221
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:45,250
you know,

222
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:45,990
kind of,

223
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:50,990
he flies that flag and he used it
easily so it's a red band can read.

224
00:05:51,641 --> 00:05:53,500
Ben's not nearly as dumb as people think.

225
00:05:53,501 --> 00:05:54,190
Yes,

226
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,920
I didn't say this is more
of an act on anything.

227
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,130
It's just a silly boy.

228
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,641
He's a funny,

229
00:05:58,641 --> 00:05:59,031
silly boy.

230
00:05:59,031 --> 00:05:59,864
He's sick today.

231
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,240
We're hoping he goes to a fucking doctor.

232
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,340
Hasn't eaten in days.

233
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:04,911
It's good.

234
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:06,050
You might want to do something there.

235
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,221
Yeah,

236
00:06:07,221 --> 00:06:07,521
man.

237
00:06:07,521 --> 00:06:08,360
Too much party.

238
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:09,194
No Bueno,

239
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:09,890
no Bueno,

240
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:10,401
no Bueno.

241
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:11,061
Too much party.

242
00:06:11,061 --> 00:06:12,290
The body wants to break.

243
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:12,441
Oh,

244
00:06:12,441 --> 00:06:13,400
good for you.

245
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,490
Go to legal zoom.com.

246
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:21,470
Use the code Rogan in the referral
box and you can save some cash.

247
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,100
They,

248
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:26,510
they do have the ability to connect you
to an independent attorney if you need

249
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,770
additional guidance to,

250
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,350
if you're going through the process,

251
00:06:29,351 --> 00:06:29,491
you know,

252
00:06:29,491 --> 00:06:29,631
like,

253
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,464
you know what,

254
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,030
I'm a fucking chicken shit.

255
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,740
I feel like I'm doing
something wrong here.

256
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:36,860
I don't want to go to jail or whatever
or have something being valid or

257
00:06:36,861 --> 00:06:37,550
whatever.

258
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,730
And so if you need extra help
in that way or if you need,

259
00:06:40,731 --> 00:06:45,200
just need extra help with whatever the
hell you're incorporating with you can,

260
00:06:45,201 --> 00:06:45,921
you can do that.

261
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:48,830
They'll connect you with an
independent attorney and uh,

262
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,810
the online process couldn't be easier.

263
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,610
They'll take care of you start to finish.

264
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,130
It's,

265
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,910
it's very easy to deal with.

266
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:56,811
And again,

267
00:06:56,811 --> 00:06:58,550
legal zoom is not a law firm.

268
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:02,570
They provide self help services
at your specific direction.

269
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,341
So get it together.

270
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:04,960
Bryan County,

271
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,590
I spent 1300 bucks on that shit.

272
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,170
I'm trying to learn.

273
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,700
I'm trying to be more computer savvy.

274
00:07:09,701 --> 00:07:11,230
I had Alexis Ohanian,

275
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:12,810
I the guy who created Reddit,

276
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,180
if I'd read it on the podcast.

277
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,333
Yeah.

278
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:18,340
Brian Gallant choosing
another bobcat's Brian,

279
00:07:18,341 --> 00:07:19,610
you have a your own podcast.

280
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,250
I can't keep up with no dude.

281
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,530
Have a 10 minute thing too.

282
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:22,780
Yeah,

283
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,261
there is dude,

284
00:07:23,261 --> 00:07:23,471
I don't,

285
00:07:23,471 --> 00:07:24,970
I have three podcasts.

286
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,200
If you guys want to laugh and
learn and be inspired and turn,

287
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:28,840
turn,

288
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,051
go.

289
00:07:29,051 --> 00:07:29,231
When,

290
00:07:29,231 --> 00:07:29,441
when,

291
00:07:29,441 --> 00:07:31,000
when Rogan's not doing his Brian,

292
00:07:31,001 --> 00:07:31,960
the kid Callan's around,

293
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,280
but very good at it.

294
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:34,750
You're,

295
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,020
you could talk for days too.

296
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:36,761
I love doing it,

297
00:07:36,761 --> 00:07:36,971
man.

298
00:07:36,971 --> 00:07:37,601
I love it.

299
00:07:37,601 --> 00:07:37,841
And I,

300
00:07:37,841 --> 00:07:39,880
and I'm getting people
like this guy I like says,

301
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:44,350
oh honey founded reddit and we were
just talking about how I have such an

302
00:07:44,351 --> 00:07:45,161
aversion as you know,

303
00:07:45,161 --> 00:07:45,994
to anything.

304
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,320
Like anything computer.

305
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,790
I'm like writing code.

306
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,530
I start to panic immediately
and he was like sweat too.

307
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:52,660
It's like I could teach you that,

308
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:52,961
you know,

309
00:07:52,961 --> 00:07:55,570
it's not that hard then these blown you.

310
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,493
That's how it works.

311
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,780
How this works,

312
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,101
found founder,

313
00:07:58,101 --> 00:07:59,770
I've read it costs me a
fortune to have them blow me.

314
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,423
Um,

315
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:01,841
I asked,

316
00:08:01,841 --> 00:08:03,160
I asked him what he does with his money.

317
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:03,401
I go,

318
00:08:03,401 --> 00:08:03,611
you know,

319
00:08:03,611 --> 00:08:05,350
you've made a 30 year old guy,

320
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:06,190
so really good guy.

321
00:08:06,191 --> 00:08:06,660
Go,

322
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,331
he made a lot of money.

323
00:08:07,331 --> 00:08:07,760
What are you doing?

324
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,260
He goes,

325
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,540
I upgraded my Redskins tickets.

326
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:10,731
Uh,

327
00:08:10,731 --> 00:08:11,081
I got,

328
00:08:11,081 --> 00:08:12,070
my dad's a huge fan,

329
00:08:12,071 --> 00:08:16,240
so I sit right behind the visitor's
bench and I like to shout at them.

330
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,070
I like to shout and get into their head.

331
00:08:18,071 --> 00:08:19,510
He just didn't salts the other team,

332
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,750
that's the first thing he did with
his money so he could go on and salt.

333
00:08:22,751 --> 00:08:27,010
Anybody who plays the Redskins and he
and his dad sit there and he sits there

334
00:08:27,011 --> 00:08:27,251
and goes,

335
00:08:27,251 --> 00:08:28,780
how many kids do you have?

336
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:29,320
How many?

337
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,970
What's your paternity bill like?

338
00:08:30,971 --> 00:08:31,870
I mean he just kills him.

339
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:32,951
Oh my God.

340
00:08:32,951 --> 00:08:36,370
Like the one dude Cooper who's
wide receivers started reddit.

341
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,030
Yeah.

342
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,650
That he's a really funny guy.

343
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:43,420
And he goes around the country talking
to colleges and basically saying to these

344
00:08:43,421 --> 00:08:43,750
kids,

345
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,583
Hey,

346
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,150
everything that you know,

347
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:49,510
like higher education and the
way you're supposed to do shit,

348
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,910
it's no longer really relevant anymore.

349
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,740
All that matters is what you can do.

350
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:56,040
And there's a whole wide
open out there for you

351
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,300
to think outside the box.

352
00:08:57,301 --> 00:08:58,380
And it's kind of like his mission,

353
00:08:58,381 --> 00:08:59,070
you know?

354
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,020
But he was talking about how he was on,

355
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:04,980
he's this Guy Cooper who was at a Justin
Bieber concert with saying some racial

356
00:09:04,981 --> 00:09:05,281
shit.

357
00:09:05,281 --> 00:09:05,491
You know,

358
00:09:05,491 --> 00:09:08,550
he's a white wide receiver saying
racist stuff about black people.

359
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,970
He gets behind the bench and he's
basically shouting at Cooper going,

360
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:12,840
Cooper,

361
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,070
do you still feel that way?

362
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,790
What's it like to be in the locker room
with all these black people who are

363
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:17,160
around you?

364
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,670
And,

365
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:17,941
and,

366
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:18,210
and,

367
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,550
and his teammates were all
laughing and making fun of them.

368
00:09:20,551 --> 00:09:22,050
They were kind of like
snickering and stuff.

369
00:09:22,051 --> 00:09:23,730
So that's what he does with his money.

370
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:29,410
Brian Cowen will be at the Houston
Improv this weekend and buffalo the next

371
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,243
week.

372
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,820
Brian callen.com and it never ends.

373
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,450
I guess we should play some music
on it.com use the code name.

374
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,910
Rogan save 10% off any
and all supplements.

375
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,330
Do we,

376
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:39,841
do we get new?

377
00:09:39,841 --> 00:09:41,040
Any Eddie kettlebells yet?

378
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:41,981
Do we get you the crime?

379
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:42,780
Will Bells Dude?

380
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,081
No.

381
00:09:43,081 --> 00:09:43,920
And I need some,

382
00:09:43,921 --> 00:09:44,754
I'm going to ask you,

383
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,541
you need the primal,

384
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:48,150
but I've been asking you
since I saw the prototype.

385
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:51,750
We'll contact Aubrey this afternoon after
this podcast is over and we will get

386
00:09:51,751 --> 00:09:54,720
some problem bells headed your
way for those fucking please.

387
00:09:54,721 --> 00:09:56,190
I'm all over them.

388
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:56,970
Wait,

389
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,410
you had one pooed which is how much?

390
00:09:58,411 --> 00:09:58,681
How much?

391
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,270
That way it's 35 pounds.

392
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,720
So then I got the 1.5 pooed
which has probably 50 pounds.

393
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:04,450
Yeah.

394
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:07,470
And then it says under
there it says 36 pounds.

395
00:10:07,471 --> 00:10:09,240
54 pounds and 72 pounds.

396
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:12,960
You're telling me I can get all three
at the low price of a on the house

397
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,391
had to low price.

398
00:10:15,391 --> 00:10:16,650
If I'm friends with Joe Rogan.

399
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:16,951
Yeah,

400
00:10:16,951 --> 00:10:17,784
you can get these.

401
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,150
These are bad ass dude.

402
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:20,363
We had a,

403
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,050
this Guy Steven Shubin Jr.

404
00:10:22,051 --> 00:10:25,540
He's the artist who created
these fucking things.

405
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:26,990
Look at the face on that.

406
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,280
There's no,

407
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:29,430
Jim is complete without,

408
00:10:29,431 --> 00:10:30,264
without those things.

409
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:34,590
Decker will is so bad ass fucking face.

410
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:35,400
Come on.

411
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,061
The guy.

412
00:10:36,061 --> 00:10:37,200
The artist is amazing.

413
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:40,530
He does like special effects for movies
and stuff like that is an artist that is

414
00:10:40,531 --> 00:10:41,910
really hard to do and steel.

415
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:42,840
I mean I think,

416
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,440
yeah.

417
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,100
Oh Dude.

418
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:44,371
Well,

419
00:10:44,371 --> 00:10:47,340
you started off in clay and then
they just make a mold of it.

420
00:10:47,341 --> 00:10:48,060
But the mold,

421
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,990
it came out like beyond our
expectations for the side view.

422
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:52,890
Yeah,

423
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:53,760
it's amazing.

424
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:54,930
It's a real piece of art.

425
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,340
It's not just a uh,

426
00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:00,030
a workout functional
workout equipment too.

427
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,880
It's a real piece of function and workout
equipment because we made sure they

428
00:11:02,881 --> 00:11:03,810
were all balanced.

429
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:08,430
One of the things about kettlebells
is part of the exercising with them is

430
00:11:08,431 --> 00:11:11,010
swinging and catching them and you,

431
00:11:11,011 --> 00:11:13,080
you want a very predictable movement.

432
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,630
Meaning you want them sort of
centered with their weight,

433
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,171
you know,

434
00:11:16,171 --> 00:11:17,970
so that when you swing it and catch it,

435
00:11:17,971 --> 00:11:20,580
there's no imbalance in the in the curve.

436
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,880
And we worked hard to make sure that
these primal kettle bells are completely

437
00:11:26,221 --> 00:11:26,970
balanced.

438
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,350
They're not wacky in any way.

439
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,940
They're really like,

440
00:11:29,941 --> 00:11:32,700
you use them once you
realize where the face is,

441
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,680
it's just like using a regular kettle,

442
00:11:34,681 --> 00:11:35,040
but right.

443
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,630
I mean you just,

444
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:38,880
you just adjust so that the
face doesn't bang in your arm.

445
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:39,813
That's the only,

446
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,510
if they were the most
imbalanced things in the world,

447
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,030
I'd still have them in my chat
up cause they're so awesome.

448
00:11:45,031 --> 00:11:45,960
So I don't really care.

449
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,230
Yeah.

450
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:50,390
They're very bad ass and kettle bells
like you see this is some fucking very

451
00:11:50,391 --> 00:11:52,920
much omad to strong guy
and lifting those things.

452
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:53,754
It's not a weak guy.

453
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:54,603
Yeah.

454
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,140
It's a fun exercise man.

455
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:01,140
And I always tell people like if you're
looking for something that absolutely

456
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,160
can enhance your functional strength,

457
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,180
that's the shit.

458
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,790
While we're going to try
to talk a little bit about,

459
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,660
yeah,

460
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,560
Mark Epstein,

461
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:09,423
we're going to talk about,

462
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:10,870

463
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:11,681
we're going to talk about,

464
00:12:11,681 --> 00:12:12,514
uh,

465
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:13,750
the guy who wrote the sports gene,

466
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,510
what's possible and what's
not possible for white people

467
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,890
was literally what the book was.

468
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,250
Yeah,

469
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,500
that's exactly what we're talking about.

470
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:23,761

491
00:13:17,751 --> 00:13:21,170

and the kid podcasts and fighter and

492
00:13:21,171 --> 00:13:23,030
the kid kids stop.

493
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,053
You don't stop.

494
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,173
I'll tell you why you don't,

495
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,130

so I love his take on fighting and then

496
00:13:28,131 --> 00:13:32,510
mine and he gets so mad at me cause I
just basically do all my research and ask

497
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:33,590
everybody about the fights.

498
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,780
Brendan is a bad motherfucker dude.

499
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,930
That that submission that
he hit mitre owned with.

500
00:13:38,931 --> 00:13:39,681
It was beautiful.

501
00:13:39,681 --> 00:13:40,230
But cars,

502
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:40,820
chokers,

503
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,390
he does.

504
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:41,871
He does.

505
00:13:41,871 --> 00:13:46,730
He did eight pull ups the other day
with 125 pounds hanging from his waist.

506
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,750
A strict pull ups,

507
00:13:47,751 --> 00:13:48,470
not kipping.

508
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,161
I believe it.

509
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,450
He's a serious grappler.

510
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:51,290
That guy can,

511
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,730
he is strong and shit.

512
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:52,881
You know,

513
00:13:52,881 --> 00:13:54,470
he took a lot of heat for that.

514
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:59,470
A Gracie a match that metamorris match
cause he basically just didn't engage for

515
00:13:59,631 --> 00:13:59,990
awhile.

516
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:04,160
But there were many moments in
the fight where they were engaged.

517
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:08,630
There was many moments where that Cyborg
guy had him in his guard and he's a

518
00:14:08,631 --> 00:14:12,530
dangerous mother fucker Cyborg and
Brendan defended every single one of them

519
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,200
sticking his hand in his
throat and just stop in that.

520
00:14:15,201 --> 00:14:16,040
That stopped it.

521
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,060
Everything perfect.

522
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:18,620
But that's a tricky game.

523
00:14:18,621 --> 00:14:19,620
You're playing with that guy.

524
00:14:19,621 --> 00:14:19,940
You're like,

525
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,140
people don't respect that.

526
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:26,030
Like that Cyborg dude is a nasty
motherfucker when it comes to Jujitsu,

527
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:26,661
his Jujitsu,

528
00:14:26,661 --> 00:14:27,321
it's really,

529
00:14:27,321 --> 00:14:27,711
really,

530
00:14:27,711 --> 00:14:28,640
really high level.

531
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,980
If there's anybody who's
earned the nickname Cyborg,

532
00:14:30,981 --> 00:14:32,360
just by the way they look,

533
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,440
it's him.

534
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:33,810
Yeah.

535
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:36,440
He felt immediately bad
about my genetic structure,

536
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:39,740
about my fucking bone structure.

537
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:39,921
Well,

538
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:42,950
this is a few cyborgs where people who
don't know what we're talking about,

539
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,611
this is the upper,

540
00:14:43,611 --> 00:14:44,430
there's a problem.

541
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,250
There's a bunch of cyborgs in Brazil.

542
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:46,710
Okay.

543
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,170
There's Cris Cyborg Santos,

544
00:14:48,171 --> 00:14:50,000
who was one of the best
women fighters in the world.

545
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,650
Really Nasty Moy fighter.

546
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,040
There's

547
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,550
her,

548
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:57,550
her husband was Ciba evangelists to
a Cyborg and then there was this guy,

549
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,850
Roberto I brew,

550
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:01,111
right.

551
00:15:01,111 --> 00:15:01,380
Is that,

552
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,213
I say his last name,

553
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:02,581
I believe.

554
00:15:02,581 --> 00:15:02,800
He said,

555
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,633
Bro,

556
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:04,161
Goddamn,

557
00:15:04,161 --> 00:15:04,994
he's nasty.

558
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,200
He's got a crazy guard.

559
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,870
He goes under guys and
then rips their legs apart.

560
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,940
Like ain't as bad as
a take down her Steve.

561
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,070
He's a tank is a tank of a human.

562
00:15:13,071 --> 00:15:13,450
Yeah,

563
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:14,420
and look,

564
00:15:14,421 --> 00:15:15,470
Brendan didn't,

565
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,930
he did a lot of just
keeping this guy off of him.

566
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:18,920
It did a lot of that.

567
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,600
But there were many moments
where he was in that guy's guard.

568
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,210
He said,

569
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,710
I think it was the eight times at Eight,

570
00:15:24,711 --> 00:15:25,011
seven,

571
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:25,880
seven times went down.

572
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:26,181
Okay.

573
00:15:26,181 --> 00:15:27,014
That's kind of,

574
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,330
that's the fact that
he was able to do that.

575
00:15:29,331 --> 00:15:30,170
It's very impressive.

576
00:15:30,171 --> 00:15:31,070
You're just grappling.

577
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,221
Look,

578
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,031
if they were striking,

579
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,200
Brendan would probably,

580
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,110
there's so many positions you would
get caught in cause you're smashing.

581
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,290
You guys are hitting him with a punch.

582
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,410
Cyber wouldn't get out of the
first round and he would know that.

583
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,240
Well not only that,

584
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:40,410
there,

585
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,280
that whole position changes
entirely like the guard.

586
00:15:43,281 --> 00:15:44,330
Everybody looks at the Guardian,

587
00:15:44,331 --> 00:15:45,970
MMA and the garden MMA,

588
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:49,280
it's one thing because guys aren't
hitting you or guys are hitting you.

589
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,390
Rather when you're in straight Jujitsu,

590
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,710
the guard becomes infinitely
more dangerous because
you're not going to hit that

591
00:15:54,711 --> 00:15:55,520
guy in the bottom.

592
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,730
So he can grab a hold of you.

593
00:15:56,731 --> 00:15:57,291
He can do things,

594
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,690
he can be wide open and still control you.

595
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,250
As soon as you add punches,

596
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,650
it changes 90% of the Jujitsu
cause that's when you,

597
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,670
you're getting you in the face
and now you see a lot of guys,

598
00:16:07,671 --> 00:16:11,320
very few guys now will close their legs
in MMA because you're taking away two of

599
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:11,930
your weapons.

600
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:12,320
You know,

601
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,190
back in the day,

602
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:13,641
you know,

603
00:16:13,641 --> 00:16:13,791
you,

604
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:14,031
you,

605
00:16:14,031 --> 00:16:14,260
you,

606
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,170
you the guys,

607
00:16:15,171 --> 00:16:17,690
a lot of guys will try to stand up
immediately and stuff like that.

608
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:17,871
It's a,

609
00:16:17,871 --> 00:16:18,501
it's a very,

610
00:16:18,501 --> 00:16:21,680
very precarious position to be
and really depends on your style.

611
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:21,980
You know,

612
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,761
there's still glass,

613
00:16:22,761 --> 00:16:23,594
the attack,

614
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:23,871
uh,

615
00:16:23,871 --> 00:16:26,700
off of their back in a full
guard like Vinny Magallanes.

616
00:16:26,701 --> 00:16:27,531
I look what happened.

617
00:16:27,531 --> 00:16:29,630
Look what liquid pedis did.

618
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,160
Yes,

619
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,190
that was a beautiful move,

620
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:31,640
man.

621
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,050
Perfect old school,

622
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,250
Brazilian Jujitsu.

623
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,730
It's still relevant still.

624
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,703
Absolutely.

625
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:37,491
There's openings.

626
00:16:37,491 --> 00:16:38,870
Just like a right hook is relevant.

627
00:16:38,871 --> 00:16:39,280
The idea,

628
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:39,861
it goes away.

629
00:16:39,861 --> 00:16:40,341
It's crazy.

630
00:16:40,341 --> 00:16:40,910
It's crazy.

631
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:41,301
They're all,

632
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:41,840
they're,

633
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,950
all those techniques are there.

634
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,030
When you've got Jake shields,

635
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,864
Damien Maia,

636
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,381
what's your,

637
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:46,170
what's your calling?

638
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,600
I have a point of view.

639
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:48,951
Well,

640
00:16:48,951 --> 00:16:49,940
I'll tell you what man.

641
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:54,190
Damien Maia is a mother
fucker at one 70 thank you.

642
00:16:54,191 --> 00:16:55,310
Look what he did to John Fitch.

643
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,670
What worries me about Jake
going down to one 70 is a,

644
00:16:58,671 --> 00:17:00,770
Jake looks unhealthy when he does it.

645
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:01,911
I mean,

646
00:17:01,911 --> 00:17:03,530
maybe he's got that back in order,

647
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,200
but I've seen him in the
weigh ins where I'm like,

648
00:17:06,201 --> 00:17:06,600
Geez,

649
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,130
he walks a two o or something.

650
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:08,480
I mean,

651
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,160
I'm sure he said he's a big fella.

652
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:10,450
You know,

653
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,780
he's very strong grappler,

654
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,620
but a one 85 he beat some dangerous guys.

655
00:17:15,621 --> 00:17:16,160
Man.

656
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,970
He put,

657
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,170
he put Robbie Lawler,

658
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:19,010
he tapped him.

659
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:22,610
He fought a five round
fight with Dan Henderson.

660
00:17:22,611 --> 00:17:26,670
That was one of the greatest comebacks
in the history of Dan Anderson's Calila

661
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,790
strong from an institution.

662
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:31,370
Dan Henderson tagged
him in that first round.

663
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:35,650
I mean tagged him like there's not a
whole lot of humans that could have

664
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,493
survived that.

665
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,900
He got hit the first round.

666
00:17:38,901 --> 00:17:43,901
Jake Shield showed like the rarest of
rare Chin's because Henderson connected

667
00:17:45,081 --> 00:17:50,081
flush on the Chin and he got out of
that and started taking Henderson down.

668
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:55,110
I think Henderson like went into that
fight with something wrong with them.

669
00:17:55,111 --> 00:17:56,070
Someone told me that he,

670
00:17:56,071 --> 00:17:56,330
uh,

671
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:56,851
he had,

672
00:17:56,851 --> 00:17:57,000
uh,

673
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,870
back issues.

674
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,340
So it could have been,

675
00:17:59,370 --> 00:17:59,611
I mean,

676
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,440
and I'm not trying to
make any excuses for Dan.

677
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,170
I'm sure he wouldn't have made any either.

678
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,470
But a lot of times when you've
seen a guy in a fight like that,

679
00:18:07,471 --> 00:18:08,550
like that's what you're dealing with.

680
00:18:08,551 --> 00:18:11,670
You're dealing with a guy goes in
there and he's got something wrong,

681
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:12,061
you know,

682
00:18:12,061 --> 00:18:12,181
and,

683
00:18:12,181 --> 00:18:15,980
and sometimes they throw strategy out the
window and just go after a guy you got

684
00:18:15,981 --> 00:18:16,741
to your happy place.

685
00:18:16,741 --> 00:18:17,100
You know,

686
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,480
sometimes you know,

687
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:19,830
you've got to play it safe.

688
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,903
You know what,

689
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,760
Damien Maia,

690
00:18:21,761 --> 00:18:22,450
when I drink,

691
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:23,590
when I saw Damien Maia,

692
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,960
what you're talking
about with Jake shields,

693
00:18:25,961 --> 00:18:26,321
when I saw it,

694
00:18:26,321 --> 00:18:27,580
Damien Maia control,

695
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:28,210
uh,

696
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:31,930
John Fitch for that long and get his back
and just basically ride him like that.

697
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:33,483
You know,

698
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,870
I think that Damien Maia is striking
from what I understand is really grown

699
00:18:37,871 --> 00:18:39,790
leaps and bounds and he's,

700
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,181
he's,

701
00:18:40,181 --> 00:18:42,630
he can keep the fight on his feet
and a lot of people say that he's,

702
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:43,750
if he does that with Jake,

703
00:18:43,751 --> 00:18:44,800
he's going to tag Jake up.

704
00:18:44,801 --> 00:18:46,240
But then if he goes to the ground,

705
00:18:46,241 --> 00:18:49,360
there's nothing that suggests that
Jake is going to be able to like,

706
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:50,410
I think his take down rate,

707
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:54,890
Damien Maia as a wrestler is like 90% or
something like he's really effective on

708
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:55,810
takedowns as well.

709
00:18:55,811 --> 00:18:56,644
So it's going to be,

710
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,490
he's a very special grappler,

711
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,050
is a very special grappler.

712
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:00,471
His,

713
00:19:00,471 --> 00:19:05,471
his area of improvement is all been his
striking catching up to the point where

714
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:09,140
he could use his grappling
more effective effectively.

715
00:19:09,141 --> 00:19:12,950
Like the Rick story fight was even more
impressive than the Fitch fight to me.

716
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,190
Cause Rick story is
fucking gorilla strong.

717
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,170
That kid is stupid strong.

718
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,930
And Maya got ahold of
him and never let go.

719
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:22,220
I mean it was crazy.

720
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,360
It was the way he did it.

721
00:19:23,361 --> 00:19:25,880
He just is so relentless
chasing them down,

722
00:19:25,881 --> 00:19:26,870
holding singles,

723
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,681
tripping them all.

724
00:19:27,681 --> 00:19:28,700
He's holding a single,

725
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,810
dragging them to the mat,

726
00:19:29,811 --> 00:19:30,591
drag up to the mat,

727
00:19:30,591 --> 00:19:31,341
dragged them to the mat,

728
00:19:31,341 --> 00:19:32,100
dragged them to that.

729
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,220
Then finally he's got his back.

730
00:19:33,221 --> 00:19:33,530
Yeah.

731
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:35,250
And then once he's got you back Das,

732
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:38,240
when you got your back
and you know what they do,

733
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,260
you know what they're finding.

734
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,370
And this leads this book,

735
00:19:40,371 --> 00:19:40,820
uh,

736
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,740
called the sports gene I'm
obsessed with right now.

737
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:43,851
I'm in a lot of people.

738
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:44,641
He's a sports illustrated,

739
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:44,701
right?

740
00:19:44,701 --> 00:19:46,250
I think Mark Epstein or David Epstein,

741
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,480
I'm a science writer and they,

742
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:48,850
they,

743
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:49,040
well,

744
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,251
why,

745
00:19:49,251 --> 00:19:50,160
why is it that say,

746
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:50,551
you know what,

747
00:19:50,551 --> 00:19:53,890
what they were trying to
figure out why a chess master,

748
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:54,531
uh,

749
00:19:54,531 --> 00:19:55,250
first of all,

750
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,860
what they found is anybody who's
going to be really good at chess,

751
00:19:57,861 --> 00:20:00,500
at grand master or a great athlete,

752
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:03,890
you can almost always tell by
the time they're 12 years old.

753
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,150
And there are a few outliers,

754
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:08,510
but just by the way they behave and
the way they work and stuff like that,

755
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:09,651
and it's not,

756
00:20:09,651 --> 00:20:13,160
the 10,000 hour rule actually is a very
shotty rule because some people can take

757
00:20:13,161 --> 00:20:14,000
four out thousand hours,

758
00:20:14,001 --> 00:20:14,834
other people can take,

759
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,733
you know,

760
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,120
25,000 hours.

761
00:20:17,121 --> 00:20:17,661
It all depends.

762
00:20:17,661 --> 00:20:18,440
But um,

763
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,680
one of the things that they found about
people who master something like great

764
00:20:21,681 --> 00:20:22,041
wrestlers,

765
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:22,701
great judo guys,

766
00:20:22,701 --> 00:20:25,670
great boxers like Floyd Mayweather is,

767
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:30,730
isn't even so much that they are
faster or stronger experience.

768
00:20:30,741 --> 00:20:32,060
You have to have a certain hardware,

769
00:20:32,061 --> 00:20:32,841
what they call a hardware,

770
00:20:32,841 --> 00:20:33,920
like a genetic hardware.

771
00:20:33,921 --> 00:20:34,400
You've got to be,

772
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:34,970
you know,

773
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:38,690
but experience when you
look at Damien Maia,

774
00:20:38,691 --> 00:20:38,931
when he,

775
00:20:38,931 --> 00:20:43,910
when he rolls experience allows the human
mind to be able to chunk information.

776
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,630
You can,

777
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:47,380
he's able to chunk shit
in larger quantity.

778
00:20:47,381 --> 00:20:48,160
So what he's

779
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:53,160
doing is he's reading signals s way
before he's reading signals that you're

780
00:20:53,681 --> 00:20:58,420
giving him even tendencies and
he's able to make assumptions.

781
00:20:58,421 --> 00:20:59,590
Even if he's not aware of it,

782
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,040
he's may able to jump three moves ahead
because he's making an assumption.

783
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:05,140
He's already predicting
what you're going to do.

784
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,460
You're thinking about it,

785
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,600
and he can tell by the way,

786
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:09,730
you're shifting your weight
from years of experience.

787
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:09,971
Oh,

788
00:21:09,971 --> 00:21:14,320
I've been here before and he compensates
much faster than you do and that's the

789
00:21:14,321 --> 00:21:15,950
difference when when,

790
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:16,170
oh,

791
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:16,900
whoa,

792
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,200
whoa,

793
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,130
that's a mind blower.

794
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:18,983
It's a mindblower.

795
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:23,160
When when they have these recognize your
patterns before people make specific,

796
00:21:23,161 --> 00:21:24,220
he's memorized the board.

797
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:28,870
He's memorized every conceivable
position on that chess board.

798
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,040
As a Jujitsu player,

799
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:34,150
that's exactly what great
chess masters are able to do.

800
00:21:34,151 --> 00:21:35,710
They can show a great chess master,

801
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:40,711
obscure games with obscure things for
three seconds and then they can read.

802
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,940
They can tell you what exactly,

803
00:21:42,941 --> 00:21:44,380
what the where everything was.

804
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,890
It's really terrifying when you're
rolling with a guy who's really,

805
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:52,540
really fucking good because one of the
things is you feel the progressions.

806
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:55,300
You feel like you're lucky.

807
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,650
You're trapped in his full guard.

808
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:57,281
Oh Shit.

809
00:21:57,281 --> 00:21:58,300
And I was got my arm.

810
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,081
Oh Shit.

811
00:21:59,081 --> 00:22:00,430
Now he's locked in the shoulder.

812
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:01,241
Oh Shit.

813
00:22:01,241 --> 00:22:02,110
Now it's tighter.

814
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,101
Oh Shit,

815
00:22:03,101 --> 00:22:04,090
now I'm in trouble.

816
00:22:04,091 --> 00:22:05,410
I'm in fucking real trouble.

817
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,570
It's like there's a real progression.

818
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,250
It's not like a wild scramble where
you know someone catches a gay teen.

819
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:12,340
It's a real,

820
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:15,490
you are dictating to an extent
whether you know it or not,

821
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:18,310
what he's going to do next
in the sense that when he,

822
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,480
when he moves,

823
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,540
you have a compensation as you compensate,

824
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:23,590
he's already ahead of you.

825
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:24,370
He's pulling,

826
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:27,550
never understand that if they've never
played chess or if they've never done

827
00:22:27,551 --> 00:22:29,440
Jujitsu angst or whatever,

828
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,790
but the box is,

829
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:35,200
I think there's less dimensions to it
just because the fact that it's just

830
00:22:35,201 --> 00:22:35,980
hands,

831
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:40,780
but then clearly you see a guy like Floyd
Mayweather who can keep boxing against

832
00:22:40,781 --> 00:22:45,160
the best guys in the world and barely
get hit and the reason is exactly what

833
00:22:45,161 --> 00:22:46,870
they were saying is that
phlegm in where she's still,

834
00:22:46,871 --> 00:22:47,351
when you box,

835
00:22:47,351 --> 00:22:48,670
you'd learn all the different patterns,

836
00:22:48,671 --> 00:22:48,880
right?

837
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,970
There are different patterns that you
learned footwork here that what he's able

838
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:54,460
to do is he knows that if he will,

839
00:22:54,461 --> 00:22:55,960
based on this pattern,

840
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,130
he learned how,

841
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:57,931
okay you,

842
00:22:57,931 --> 00:22:59,300
you create this opening,

843
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,000
then you step to the side and you do this.

844
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,880
What he'll do is jump to to pattern three.

845
00:23:03,881 --> 00:23:05,440
He'll literally anticipate,

846
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:09,610
he can see that you're moving over here
and he's so far ahead of you and that's

847
00:23:09,611 --> 00:23:14,470
why it's impossible to touch the guy he's
seeing before you throw the punch what

848
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:18,490
based on your body language and
based on where your eyes are,

849
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,900
he's able to chunk all that
information so quickly that he is,

850
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,250
the minute you think about it,

851
00:23:24,251 --> 00:23:25,390
the second you think,

852
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:25,661
oh,

853
00:23:25,661 --> 00:23:26,440
I'm going to do this.

854
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,190
He's already headed.

855
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:27,371
He goes,

856
00:23:27,371 --> 00:23:27,491
oh,

857
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:29,520
he's going to do this and
now his hands up before.

858
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,270
Well that's sort of
interesting because it's,

859
00:23:31,271 --> 00:23:33,310
it's hard to explain.

860
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:37,780
It's sparring I think to someone who's
never spartan before and to a lot of

861
00:23:37,781 --> 00:23:38,920
folks when you look at it,

862
00:23:38,921 --> 00:23:41,430
it looks like one guy is
trying to hit the God.

863
00:23:41,431 --> 00:23:44,050
The other guy was trying to hit the guy
and they kind of meet in the middle and

864
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,220
figure out who hits who when.

865
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:49,040
There's a lot of weirdness to sparring.

866
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:50,870
There's a rhythm to it is,

867
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,190
it's a very strange thing.

868
00:23:52,191 --> 00:23:55,250
Getting him to think something
and then capitalizing on,

869
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,090
you know,

870
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:57,890
getting used to being hit too.

871
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:58,700
There's that.

872
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,530
You have to be able to keep your,

873
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,221
your,

874
00:24:01,221 --> 00:24:01,580
your,

875
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:05,060
your shit about you while
things are flying at your face.

876
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:05,981
Some people just,

877
00:24:05,981 --> 00:24:07,580
they see things fly at their faces.

878
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:08,683
Well your heart,

879
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,390
your head goes down and
it takes a long time.

880
00:24:11,391 --> 00:24:13,160
I've worked at instinct out of your body,

881
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:13,994
being able to look,

882
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:14,601
eat,

883
00:24:14,601 --> 00:24:16,340
see a punch into your face basically.

884
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:17,210
We'll do it a lot of,

885
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,540
unfortunately a lot of people's instincts
is definitely look for the punch.

886
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:23,060
It's tried to like to have their
heads straight up in the air.

887
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,590
It's like what's going on?

888
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,950
Try and see things more clearly so
they're sticking their neck up and getting

889
00:24:27,951 --> 00:24:28,760
cracked.

890
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,230
That happens in a panic mode.

891
00:24:30,231 --> 00:24:31,910
You see a lot of guys in a panic mode,

892
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,500
like they'll drop their hands down.

893
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,281
I'll never forget.

894
00:24:34,281 --> 00:24:34,880
Um,

895
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,570
there was a fight in front of the comedy
store one night and I don't know who

896
00:24:38,571 --> 00:24:39,291
started what.

897
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:40,970
I have no idea what was going on.

898
00:24:40,971 --> 00:24:44,180
All I just knew it was that these two
guys were in this really heated exchange

899
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:48,290
and one guy was a white guy and
one guy was a black guy and uh,

900
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:53,350
the white guy went into full slap panic
standing square and it just literally

901
00:24:55,491 --> 00:24:56,240
doing this,

902
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,350
it was so crazy.

903
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:58,401
It was so crazy.

904
00:24:58,401 --> 00:24:59,030
He was just,

905
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,470
he had a full meltdown.

906
00:25:00,471 --> 00:25:00,771
First of all,

907
00:25:00,771 --> 00:25:03,770
I couldn't believe that he was about
to have a fist fight with this guy who

908
00:25:03,771 --> 00:25:06,830
clearly look more physically strong,

909
00:25:06,831 --> 00:25:08,000
much larger.

910
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:08,840
Looked like a,

911
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,710
like an athlete,

912
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:10,281
you know?

913
00:25:10,281 --> 00:25:12,770
And so I don't know what happens.

914
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:17,450
I saw the slapping and the freaking
and then a bus drove in front of,

915
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,110
or no,

916
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,790
and I couldn't see anything for like,

917
00:25:19,791 --> 00:25:20,090
you know,

918
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:24,170
15 seconds or whatever it was until
the bus was gone and then boom,

919
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,970
the white guys down flat.

920
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:29,150
So some in between him flailing,

921
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:29,811
he got caught,

922
00:25:29,811 --> 00:25:30,644
he got,

923
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:31,520
he got smashed.

924
00:25:31,521 --> 00:25:35,510
He was completely unconscious on
the concrete in the street at all.

925
00:25:35,511 --> 00:25:36,470
You have to do is get in a ring.

926
00:25:36,471 --> 00:25:38,210
Just chuck playing around
with a guy who can actually,

927
00:25:38,211 --> 00:25:40,070
I always say that people like if you
think you're talking about getting a ring

928
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:42,230
with any cruiserweight
who's even an amateur,

929
00:25:42,231 --> 00:25:43,280
I been boxing a long time.

930
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:47,960
You won't touch him and he'll hit you
once in your whole life will change.

931
00:25:47,961 --> 00:25:48,351
You'll be like,

932
00:25:48,351 --> 00:25:49,310
I don't want to ever do this again,

933
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:50,970
and guys that are really
good with footwork,

934
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:54,800
they always make you feel so stupid
because if you're a person who's never,

935
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,750
you're going to move off balance.

936
00:25:56,751 --> 00:25:59,450
This guy is going to be moving
on and you're going to be like,

937
00:25:59,480 --> 00:25:59,691
oh,

938
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:00,730
you're not even there.

939
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,010
Like,

940
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:01,843
oh Jesus.

941
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:02,601
Like you know,

942
00:26:02,601 --> 00:26:06,140
it's a language that they had an amazing
spirit experiment in this book where

943
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:07,850
Major League baseball players,

944
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:10,220
almost all of them are
off the charts visually.

945
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:12,770
They have 2010 2017 visuals.

946
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:15,140
There's almost no really
great hitters there.

947
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:17,540
I don't think there are any
who have even 2020 vision.

948
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:21,800
They almost all without a doubt have
vision that is off the charts there in the

949
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:22,980
one percentile.

950
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,400
I'm talking about all
major league hitters.

951
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:26,280
Uh,

952
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:26,540
and,

953
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,430
and the book is very
eloquent and about this.

954
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:33,490
And so they took Albert Poo hosts and who
and Alex Rodriguez and some incredible

955
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,513
hitters,

956
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,410
like the best of all
time of their generation.

957
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:37,800
And they had um,

958
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,860
and one of the things they
found is that when a baseball,

959
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,290
it comes at you at 95 miles
an hour from 60 feet away,

960
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,830
you have to guess where it's going.

961
00:26:43,831 --> 00:26:43,980
You're

962
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,640
not going to see it.

963
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,360
The human eye cannot register in time
to actually see and hit the ball.

964
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,890
So what great hitters do is they're able
to actually see the seams on the ball.

965
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:56,730
They're able to see the seams on the
ball and through years and years of how

966
00:26:56,731 --> 00:27:00,480
those scenes are rolling and how
that pitcher throws the ball,

967
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,560
they're able,

968
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,910
if they're very good,

969
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,080
if they're very good,

970
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:09,140
30% of the time they are able to predict
and start swinging basically when he

971
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:11,850
lets go of the ball.

972
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:14,310
So that's where why curve
balls and shit work.

973
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:15,000
Yes,

974
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,610
they can change where the ball's
going to be changed direction.

975
00:27:17,611 --> 00:27:21,430
But also the way you hit a curve
off you're really great is you have,

976
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:24,960
you can see the way these
guys can literally cause
they have such good eyes can

977
00:27:24,961 --> 00:27:28,470
see the pattern of the red strings
coming at you at 95 miles an hour.

978
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:31,980
They can chunk all that information
quickly enough and start swinging low as

979
00:27:31,981 --> 00:27:36,030
opposed to hi and connect to you have
to guess now they take the greatest

980
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:40,980
hitters in major league baseball and
they take out female Olympic softball

981
00:27:40,981 --> 00:27:42,560
pitcher who pitches underhand.

982
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:44,730
Now the distance is about 40 feet,

983
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:45,990
a little bit more than 40 feet.

984
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,150
The ball's coming over at
about 60 miles an hour,

985
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,940
not 95 miles an hour and
she pitches underhand.

986
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:54,810
Now these are the best pitchers and they
hit a much smaller ball at 95 miles an

987
00:27:54,811 --> 00:27:55,620
hour.

988
00:27:55,620 --> 00:28:00,620
She struck out every single picture over
and over and over again because guess

989
00:28:02,401 --> 00:28:02,641
what?

990
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:05,190
There are novices cause you
know why they couldn't guess.

991
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,900
They were looking at
a very different ball.

992
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:10,980
They didn't have the strings and
she was pitching underhand so they,

993
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:13,590
there was no way for
them to predict anything.

994
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:16,680
They were swinging blind and
they were as bad as you and I.

995
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,233
How about that?

996
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,291
That's amazing.

997
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:19,830
Yeah.

998
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,030
So the more you learn,

999
00:28:21,031 --> 00:28:21,721
the more we learn.

1000
00:28:21,721 --> 00:28:24,210
Not only about you have to
have a certain hardware.

1001
00:28:24,211 --> 00:28:26,730
We know as an athlete you
are never going to be,

1002
00:28:26,731 --> 00:28:29,430
you and I are never going to be sprinters.

1003
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:30,301
It ain't happening.

1004
00:28:30,301 --> 00:28:30,841
Sorry.

1005
00:28:30,841 --> 00:28:31,460
Shit.

1006
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,860
You don't come from west Africa.

1007
00:28:33,861 --> 00:28:35,140
It was never very fast runner.

1008
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,260
There were European dude short legs.

1009
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,123
It's not going to happen.

1010
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:39,870
You have much longer legs than me though.

1011
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,591
Not really.

1012
00:28:40,591 --> 00:28:41,880
I got the long torso.

1013
00:28:41,881 --> 00:28:43,170
It's very unfortunate and mess.

1014
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:43,720
I'm a mess.

1015
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,400
This why?

1016
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,330
Why we go to Montana.

1017
00:28:45,331 --> 00:28:48,500
I got seven layers on a can't stay warm
and you're all toasty cause you're but

1018
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,373
like an Inuit.

1019
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,300
I'm built like a fucking tulip.

1020
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,520
Why I just dressed right and cashmere.

1021
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,393
That's true too.

1022
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:59,400
Cause I have Hama a very classic cashmere.

1023
00:28:59,401 --> 00:29:00,220
I was three layers.

1024
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:00,740
I was worried.

1025
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,770
Real hunting gear.

1026
00:29:01,771 --> 00:29:02,940
I was wearing Ryan Callahan.

1027
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:05,980
I brought three expensive
layers of cashmere wool.

1028
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:06,980
It's all about wool,

1029
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:07,680
wolves,

1030
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:07,981
wolves.

1031
00:29:07,981 --> 00:29:08,461
Amazing.

1032
00:29:08,461 --> 00:29:08,650
Yeah.

1033
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:09,241
Was amazing.

1034
00:29:09,241 --> 00:29:10,800
It's amazing that in this day and age,

1035
00:29:10,801 --> 00:29:12,120
like that's the best shit as well.

1036
00:29:12,121 --> 00:29:13,050
Like a wool blend.

1037
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,680
No Shit.

1038
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,610
Even after all these years,

1039
00:29:14,611 --> 00:29:15,390
if it gets wet,

1040
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:16,260
you want to be in wool,

1041
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,310
they say cotton kills,

1042
00:29:17,311 --> 00:29:17,540
right?

1043
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,840
Yes it does.

1044
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:19,260
Yeah.

1045
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:23,520
You can get sweaty in the cotton and it
sticks to you and cools your body down

1046
00:29:23,521 --> 00:29:25,200
to the point where it gets dangerous.

1047
00:29:25,201 --> 00:29:26,190
You can get hypothermia.

1048
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,970
It's just like being wet and it's not
like you're going to take the clothes off,

1049
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,301
you know,

1050
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:32,880
you're f you're outside
frozen so you're fucked.

1051
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:33,510
No thanks.

1052
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:33,840
Yeah.

1053
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,141
Don't,

1054
00:29:34,141 --> 00:29:35,070
don't want to die that way.

1055
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,570
We'll is what's up wools.

1056
00:29:36,571 --> 00:29:37,070
Amazing.

1057
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:37,240
And,

1058
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:37,740
and they've,

1059
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,281
and they also,

1060
00:29:38,281 --> 00:29:38,791
in this book,

1061
00:29:38,791 --> 00:29:41,100
they also talk about the idea
rod in different cultures of how,

1062
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:41,980
like when you're

1063
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,150
closer to the equator,

1064
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,830
you want longer limbs.

1065
00:29:44,831 --> 00:29:45,251
Why?

1066
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:49,810
Because it's a larger area of
space for you to get rid of heat.

1067
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:50,760
So,

1068
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,940
so if you look at,

1069
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,540
um,

1070
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,380
for the most part,

1071
00:29:53,381 --> 00:29:55,730
people from Africa who,

1072
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,520
Kenya for example,

1073
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,250
they have a very different structure.

1074
00:30:00,251 --> 00:30:02,590
Their bodies are structured differently
than I was a born in a much higher

1075
00:30:02,591 --> 00:30:03,041
altitude.

1076
00:30:03,041 --> 00:30:04,870
You're not beating a Kenyan
in a long distance rate.

1077
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:05,350
Grace,

1078
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,280
it ain't happening.

1079
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:09,160
Don't they run down
animals until they die?

1080
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,170
Persistence.

1081
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:11,680
And that certainly was the,

1082
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:12,401
if you read,

1083
00:30:12,401 --> 00:30:12,941
born to run,

1084
00:30:12,941 --> 00:30:14,950
that's certainly what
what our ancestors did.

1085
00:30:14,951 --> 00:30:18,910
And that's why human beings are the best
long distance runners of any animal,

1086
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:19,480
period.

1087
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:19,930
We are,

1088
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:22,120
we can run longer than any animal,

1089
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:22,990
any antelope,

1090
00:30:22,991 --> 00:30:23,621
any horse.

1091
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:25,690
We can run for a day.

1092
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,810
If you train for it and
no animal can do that.

1093
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:29,830
Tell me this,

1094
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,660
why don't cowboys ride people?

1095
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,550
Ah,

1096
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:35,680
I shit you going to ask me a question?

1097
00:30:35,681 --> 00:30:37,840
Ride horses and horses and walk all day.

1098
00:30:37,841 --> 00:30:38,674
I don't get it.

1099
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,820
You and your parables.

1100
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,830
Fucking stupid bullshit.

1101
00:30:41,831 --> 00:30:42,650
Sensei Joe.

1102
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:43,271
Fuck it.

1103
00:30:43,271 --> 00:30:45,250
A person have worn Dorrance in a horse.

1104
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,450
That might be one of the dumbest
things I've ever heard in my life.

1105
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,200
What happens when you have me as a guest?

1106
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,730
I can't buy that in any way.

1107
00:30:51,731 --> 00:30:53,710
Straight through for
people ride bucking horses,

1108
00:30:53,711 --> 00:30:54,190
man.

1109
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:56,470
Not only can a person
ride a horse all day,

1110
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:58,060
but they're on the horse.

1111
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,250
The horse is running
with a person on them.

1112
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,050
Well that's true.

1113
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,870
Saddle if you're a fucking real man,

1114
00:31:04,871 --> 00:31:07,620
if you traveled with rifles
like Clint Eastwood in life,

1115
00:31:07,621 --> 00:31:09,820
we're given and my trench coat,

1116
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,430
I can't buy that sun and less.

1117
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:12,761
No,

1118
00:31:12,761 --> 00:31:13,541
it's actually a fact.

1119
00:31:13,541 --> 00:31:17,050
It's actually a fact that human beings
have the best long distance runners of

1120
00:31:17,051 --> 00:31:17,950
any animal park.

1121
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,370
It'd be better than a horse because
a horse actually cannot run after.

1122
00:31:21,371 --> 00:31:23,260
If you had a horse run for 26 miles,

1123
00:31:23,261 --> 00:31:24,190
you can have a horse walk.

1124
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,220
If you had a horse run for 26
miles or 30 miles or whatever,

1125
00:31:27,221 --> 00:31:28,120
it would start to break down.

1126
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,320
Yes.

1127
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,730
And it will not do that well.

1128
00:31:30,731 --> 00:31:31,840
It would even get a tail.

1129
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:32,950
Even a wild horse.

1130
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,900
They never run long distances ever.

1131
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,520
So they're just running
away from Cheetahs.

1132
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:37,200
Yes,

1133
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,890
they run stop cheetahs.

1134
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,720
Cheetahs like in a wild horse.

1135
00:31:40,721 --> 00:31:42,060
Cause we have a lot of,

1136
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,060
you know why you can
never domesticate a zebra.

1137
00:31:46,061 --> 00:31:47,170
They've tried a thousand times.

1138
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,460
Their dicks are two big nope.

1139
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:49,563
That's good question.

1140
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:49,940
Good.

1141
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,680
Good answer.

1142
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,351
Good answer sir.

1143
00:31:51,351 --> 00:31:52,184
But you're wrong.

1144
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,110
Do you know why?

1145
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:55,210
Why they cannot they?

1146
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,730
Because a zebra will bite you.

1147
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:58,511
That's one thing.

1148
00:31:58,511 --> 00:31:59,321
Horses will bite you.

1149
00:31:59,321 --> 00:31:59,800
Wild horses.

1150
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,081
It bites you.

1151
00:32:00,081 --> 00:32:01,030
It gets what is Ebro do.

1152
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,073
Hold on.

1153
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:02,980
And it won't let go.

1154
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:03,850
Oh God.

1155
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:04,211
Oh yeah.

1156
00:32:04,211 --> 00:32:06,040
No Zebra hold on you
and start twisting it.

1157
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:06,990
So that's it.

1158
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,720
Oh my God.

1159
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,010
So by two clamps onto like a pit bull,

1160
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,590
whether it's super long,

1161
00:32:11,591 --> 00:32:12,281
gigantic,

1162
00:32:12,281 --> 00:32:13,240
powerful jaw.

1163
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:13,570
Yup.

1164
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:15,490
You are never domesticating a cheetah.

1165
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,061
I mean a,

1166
00:32:16,061 --> 00:32:16,750
um,

1167
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:17,020
uh,

1168
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,180
never domesticating a zebra.

1169
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:21,850
You're never riding a zebra and they've
tried even crossbreeding it with other

1170
00:32:21,851 --> 00:32:23,080
animals ain't happening.

1171
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,400
They fucking hate you.

1172
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:28,410
They're nasty striped motherfuckers.

1173
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:28,901
Yeah,

1174
00:32:28,901 --> 00:32:30,490
I would imagine they would be Kentucky.

1175
00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:31,271
They have to be,

1176
00:32:31,271 --> 00:32:35,320
you're out there living with fucking
crocodiles to left you and lines to the

1177
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,130
right.

1178
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:36,911
Sucks.

1179
00:32:36,911 --> 00:32:38,080
Life is a zebra.

1180
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,350
That's gotta be the worst life.

1181
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:42,530
And you can't afford an ACL tear
cause you don't have a year.

1182
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:42,960
That's,

1183
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,671
we can say that.

1184
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:46,850
I was in Colorado recently and
I saw a deer with a broken leg.

1185
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:48,020
It was so sad.

1186
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:49,470
It was a dealer,

1187
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:52,950
a female deer with a mouthwatering.

1188
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,680
When you say that and then keep
going because you got high before.

1189
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,050
I know I just love venison.

1190
00:32:57,051 --> 00:32:57,884
But yeah,

1191
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:01,731
the uh,

1192
00:33:01,731 --> 00:33:05,630
the poor dears bone was actually sticking
out the bottom of its leg and it just

1193
00:33:05,631 --> 00:33:09,570
made me think like instantly
about medical care and about it,

1194
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:10,160
you know,

1195
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,440
being a human and how
much we take for granted,

1196
00:33:12,441 --> 00:33:16,640
the ability to repair ourselves
and the ability that doctors have,

1197
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,030
you know,

1198
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:17,181
the,

1199
00:33:17,181 --> 00:33:22,181
the ability that they have today of fixing
so many ailments with the human body.

1200
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:24,140
When I went to Springfield,

1201
00:33:24,141 --> 00:33:25,340
I went to the Lincoln Museum.

1202
00:33:25,341 --> 00:33:27,050
Lincoln lost three of his children,

1203
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,080
but a tad at for Willie at 11.

1204
00:33:30,081 --> 00:33:32,780
And in his other son at
17 on both to typhus,

1205
00:33:32,781 --> 00:33:33,590
fever.

1206
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,490
And I thought to myself,

1207
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,940
the present United States lost three
of his kids to disease back then.

1208
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,220
That was so commonplace.

1209
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:42,470
And he had one child
left by the time he died.

1210
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:44,870
I believe in and think
about you and I have kids.

1211
00:33:44,871 --> 00:33:46,800
Think about the misery of a four
year old losing a four year old,

1212
00:33:46,801 --> 00:33:47,210
11 year old.

1213
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:48,110
We can't imagine it.

1214
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,700
That was the norm back then.

1215
00:33:49,701 --> 00:33:50,540
Bearing a child,

1216
00:33:50,541 --> 00:33:52,010
why didn't have vaccines,

1217
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,030
didn't have antibiotics,

1218
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,210
didn't have anesthesia,

1219
00:33:54,211 --> 00:33:57,410
it didn't have medical care the way we
do now and didn't even know really what

1220
00:33:57,411 --> 00:33:58,161
pathogens were.

1221
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:01,130
So when dip theory and typhus fever
and things like that rolled through,

1222
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,010
you know,

1223
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:04,070
this is why I get so mad at
the anti vaccine movement.

1224
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,170
Pick up a history book,

1225
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:10,550
pick up a history book and see what
happened before we had that kind of

1226
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:11,300
healthcare.

1227
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:15,170
We owe a great deal to people like you
on a sock and the inventors of things

1228
00:34:15,171 --> 00:34:16,430
like the smallpox vaccine,

1229
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,390
those are horrible.

1230
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:20,450
Not just diseases but also surgery.

1231
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:20,870
What,

1232
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:22,340
what they're able to do today.

1233
00:34:22,341 --> 00:34:27,341
I mean there's the first ever FDA approved
bionic eye is ready for commercial

1234
00:34:28,221 --> 00:34:30,340
launch in the U s yeah.

1235
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:31,310
Pull that up on my,

1236
00:34:31,311 --> 00:34:31,610
uh,

1237
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:32,090
wow.

1238
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:32,923
Pulled it up on my,

1239
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:34,280
it's on my Twitter feed.

1240
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,480
I put it on there this morning.

1241
00:34:35,481 --> 00:34:36,360
It's on Cnet,

1242
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:36,681
dude.

1243
00:34:36,681 --> 00:34:38,210
We are bashing with machines now.

1244
00:34:38,211 --> 00:34:40,180
There's a little commercial
that plays before,

1245
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,870
but it's incredible.

1246
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:42,291
They're,

1247
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:42,800
uh,

1248
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,040
they've been working
on this bionic eye and,

1249
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:46,161
uh,

1250
00:34:46,161 --> 00:34:49,140
the first ever FDA approved bionic,

1251
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:53,000
I will soon be launching commercially
in the United States device device.

1252
00:34:53,001 --> 00:34:56,240
Could help tens of thousands of people
suffer from a rare degenerative eye

1253
00:34:56,241 --> 00:34:57,074
disease.

1254
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,900
So is it an actual
eyeball or something or,

1255
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:00,823
I don't know.

1256
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:01,783
Oh my God.

1257
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,680
But it's allowing people to see,

1258
00:35:03,681 --> 00:35:05,720
I think it's something
you wear like glasses.

1259
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,690
It attaches to the optic
nerve or something.

1260
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:07,971
Whoa.

1261
00:35:07,971 --> 00:35:09,230
This is crazy.

1262
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:09,981
Oh my God.

1263
00:35:09,981 --> 00:35:11,810
This is some Super Cyborg Shit.

1264
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,640
Let me see.

1265
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:13,881
Yeah.

1266
00:35:13,881 --> 00:35:15,310
This guy was a blind guy.

1267
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,760
Now he's moving around.

1268
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:19,000
This is insane.

1269
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:19,791
He,

1270
00:35:19,791 --> 00:35:20,270
uh,

1271
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:22,640
he's got these glasses on and he,

1272
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:23,683
he's uh,

1273
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,460
doing all kinds of different shit.

1274
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,650
This is really kind of naughty.

1275
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,493
Let's hear this.

1276
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:31,040
Tony Dean Lloyd suffers
from retinitis Pigmentosa,

1277
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,840
a degenerative eye disease,

1278
00:35:32,841 --> 00:35:34,640
which destroys photo receptors,

1279
00:35:34,641 --> 00:35:35,300
cells,

1280
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,010
and impedes a person's
ability to detect light.

1281
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,200
I saw nothing I slept.

1282
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:43,500
Maybe I could ascertain
daytime from nighttime.

1283
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:46,830
That was the only thing I
could be say for 17 years.

1284
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:47,551
Now.

1285
00:35:47,551 --> 00:35:51,720
A device at 20 years in the making that
will soon be commercially available in

1286
00:35:51,721 --> 00:35:56,520
the US is helping patients like Lloyd I
perception was sort of like a flash of

1287
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:59,730
light or a star that you
might see in the sky.

1288
00:35:59,790 --> 00:35:59,911
Well,

1289
00:35:59,911 --> 00:36:00,270
no,

1290
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:01,620
I can see boundaries and borders.

1291
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:06,770
The artists to buy second site was FDA
approved earlier this year and patients

1292
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:11,931
are being screened at the 12 major US
hospitals chosen as implant centers and

1293
00:36:12,481 --> 00:36:13,920
you can hear it beeping away.

1294
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:18,330
The device includes a chip with an array
of electrodes that's implanted on the

1295
00:36:18,331 --> 00:36:23,331
retina and glasses with a video camera
that wirelessly transmits images.

1296
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:29,060
It converts that video into a 60 pixel
image that then delivers electronic

1297
00:36:29,851 --> 00:36:34,851
impulses to the 60 little electrodes in
the chip that then stimulate the retina

1298
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:36,030
to generate,

1299
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:36,390
uh,

1300
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:36,991
perception.

1301
00:36:36,991 --> 00:36:39,810
Our message that the brain can
then interpret and understand.

1302
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:40,800
They're just not credible.

1303
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,720
It doesn't restore vision,

1304
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,810
but patients can detect light and dark.

1305
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:50,490
Thus identifying an object location
and movement or walk down the sidewalk.

1306
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:55,500
My bus stop to my office on a daily basis
and I can see where the grass comes up

1307
00:36:56,731 --> 00:36:59,520
til I sidewalk this like concrete color.

1308
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:04,170
The device is not going to enable
them to drive a car or you know,

1309
00:37:04,171 --> 00:37:05,720
read fine print on a newspaper,

1310
00:37:05,721 --> 00:37:08,700
but that it might help them
enjoy a better quality of life.

1311
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:11,610
Some patients report that
they can see the outline,

1312
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,103
but it's a start.

1313
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:13,591
It's a start.

1314
00:37:13,591 --> 00:37:14,100
It's a start.

1315
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:14,933
Yeah.

1316
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:16,201
And a,

1317
00:37:16,201 --> 00:37:16,831
I know they have,

1318
00:37:16,831 --> 00:37:17,220
um,

1319
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,740
they have implants now too for certain,

1320
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:20,400
uh,

1321
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,230
certain things that go
wrong with people's eyes.

1322
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,440
Like someone was talking about their,

1323
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:25,710
their grandmother.

1324
00:37:25,711 --> 00:37:29,670
Was it Kathleen Madigan was talking
about her grandmother driving all of her

1325
00:37:29,671 --> 00:37:31,530
friends around because
she had her eyes fixed.

1326
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,401
Oh yeah,

1327
00:37:32,401 --> 00:37:33,234
you told me about that.

1328
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:33,691
Yeah,

1329
00:37:33,691 --> 00:37:34,524
I remember that.

1330
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,940
I'm not sure if it was Kathleen,

1331
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:36,330
um,

1332
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:37,163
whoever it was,

1333
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:38,280
you know,

1334
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,540
we're getting close to,

1335
00:37:39,541 --> 00:37:40,051
I just can't,

1336
00:37:40,051 --> 00:37:40,890
as I'm reading this book,

1337
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:41,280
this portion,

1338
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:41,551
and I'm like,

1339
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:43,410
when are they going to come up
with gene doping where I can,

1340
00:37:43,411 --> 00:37:46,090
my whole body can be ridiculously fast.

1341
00:37:46,091 --> 00:37:46,440
Twitch.

1342
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,570
I think you're going to be
able to be a zebra one day.

1343
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:49,221
Well,

1344
00:37:49,221 --> 00:37:49,600
that's big.

1345
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,433
It's going to be that crutch.

1346
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:51,420
Craig venter says,

1347
00:37:51,421 --> 00:37:51,720
right?

1348
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,730
You're going to have a
brain inside of zebras body.

1349
00:37:53,731 --> 00:37:54,210
You could,

1350
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:55,470
you could do whatever the fuck you want.

1351
00:37:55,471 --> 00:37:56,101
Check this out.

1352
00:37:56,101 --> 00:37:57,330
This is what I blew my mind about,

1353
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:57,901
about this.

1354
00:37:57,901 --> 00:37:58,220
So,

1355
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,820
so if you take a huge guy like,

1356
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,140
uh,

1357
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,560
I Allister over rain or you know,

1358
00:38:01,561 --> 00:38:02,394
Brendan Shop,

1359
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:05,460
do you know how much more his
skeleton ways than say mine?

1360
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:06,361
Um,

1361
00:38:06,361 --> 00:38:07,590
I'm 170 pound guy,

1362
00:38:07,591 --> 00:38:09,180
but I probably a lot more,

1363
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:10,170
yeah,

1364
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:10,710
of course.

1365
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,840
6.5 pounds more maybe.

1366
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:13,861
Really?

1367
00:38:13,861 --> 00:38:14,251
Yes.

1368
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:15,084
In that crazy.

1369
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:15,481
Yeah,

1370
00:38:15,481 --> 00:38:17,850
because you have to look
at it as a book bookshelf.

1371
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,620
Some people have a wider bookshelf,

1372
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:23,020
but actually the bones
themselves are our six,

1373
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:23,420
you know,

1374
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,600
they're a little bit wider.

1375
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,050
The structure of your skeletons,

1376
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,060
a little bit like inches,

1377
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:27,820
like inches,

1378
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,653
like say three,

1379
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:31,050
three inches in leg bone is a lot.

1380
00:38:31,051 --> 00:38:31,291
Right?

1381
00:38:31,291 --> 00:38:32,760
So now you're 65 or whatever.

1382
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,270
Right.

1383
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,560
But um,

1384
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:35,830
that,

1385
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:36,220
that

1386
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,650
actual scaffolding allows you to put on.

1387
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:38,981
Um,

1388
00:38:38,981 --> 00:38:39,520
I think,

1389
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:39,761
uh,

1390
00:38:39,761 --> 00:38:41,020
I can't remember what the ratio is,

1391
00:38:41,021 --> 00:38:46,021
but like 1.1 pounds of muscle can
support 11 pounds of bone can support 11

1392
00:38:46,511 --> 00:38:47,240
pounds of muscle.

1393
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:47,610
So you,

1394
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:48,550
so just kind of like,

1395
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:48,881
no,

1396
00:38:48,881 --> 00:38:49,900
but this is in the book,

1397
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,000
but I was amazed at that.

1398
00:38:51,001 --> 00:38:51,761
Like a huge guy.

1399
00:38:51,761 --> 00:38:54,550
Only his bone structure is
only 6.5 pounds heavier.

1400
00:38:54,551 --> 00:38:55,031
I wouldn't get,

1401
00:38:55,031 --> 00:38:56,230
he's an NFL Lineman,

1402
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,450
one of us,

1403
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:58,180
like much,

1404
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:58,771
much heavier.

1405
00:38:58,771 --> 00:38:58,960
No,

1406
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,000
the rest is bones and,

1407
00:39:00,001 --> 00:39:01,960
and the rest is muscle and tendon tissue.

1408
00:39:01,961 --> 00:39:02,700
It's quite some money.

1409
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:06,040
Well that's a lot of fucking weight and
muscle and tendon smashing you down with

1410
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:07,060
the extra 60 pounds.

1411
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,133
Yeah,

1412
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:08,561
yeah,

1413
00:39:08,561 --> 00:39:09,010
it is.

1414
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:10,660
It's weird though that
it's only six pounds.

1415
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,680
I was amazed at that.

1416
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:13,180
I'm a wealth of information,

1417
00:39:13,181 --> 00:39:13,781
ladies and gentlemen,

1418
00:39:13,781 --> 00:39:15,640
I would have assumed it
was way more than that.

1419
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,650
I would have assumed it was
like 50 or something crazy.

1420
00:39:17,651 --> 00:39:18,720
You know,

1421
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,290
I'm getting him on my podcast.

1422
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,070
I'm excited.

1423
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:21,221
Well,

1424
00:39:21,221 --> 00:39:25,420
human body weight is a fascinating thing
to me because I watch all these guys

1425
00:39:25,421 --> 00:39:28,660
cut weight for fighting and
it's just really shocking.

1426
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,440
What's,

1427
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,820
what's possible like water,

1428
00:39:30,821 --> 00:39:31,061
right?

1429
00:39:31,061 --> 00:39:32,130
How much water you lose.

1430
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,150
Different guys do it a different way.

1431
00:39:34,151 --> 00:39:34,990
Some guys lose,

1432
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:35,380
uh,

1433
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:38,020
all their body fat first
and then they dehydrate,

1434
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:38,740
you know,

1435
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:42,430
the discipline that it takes to
get to like your optimum weight.

1436
00:39:42,431 --> 00:39:45,790
Like Damien Maia is finally
at one 70 for a long time.

1437
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:49,810
He fought at one 85 and he just
couldn't overpower these guys like that.

1438
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:50,261
You know,

1439
00:39:50,261 --> 00:39:52,930
he's dealing with a lot of guys that
were like really physically strong.

1440
00:39:52,931 --> 00:39:54,970
Like to Anderson Anderson's
very physically strong.

1441
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,130
So even if he could get
ahold of Anderson that fight,

1442
00:39:57,131 --> 00:39:59,650
which he really had a hard to have you
or you've talked to a fighters to talk

1443
00:39:59,651 --> 00:40:00,200
about strong.

1444
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:00,431
He is.

1445
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:02,080
He's very physically strong and beans.

1446
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,053
Yes.

1447
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:03,990
Yes.

1448
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:05,140
Anderson's very physically strong.

1449
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:06,550
You can tell in the,

1450
00:40:06,551 --> 00:40:06,761
uh,

1451
00:40:06,761 --> 00:40:11,420
the rich Franklin fights when Anderson
locks a hold of him with the Thai camp.

1452
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:13,120
It's a nasty Thai clinch.

1453
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,470
I mean it's really good and rich,

1454
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:18,490
rich Franklin is a very strong guy
and rich Franklin up until that fight,

1455
00:40:18,491 --> 00:40:20,400
it never really been dominated in a fight.

1456
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:21,700
He had some good fights,

1457
00:40:21,701 --> 00:40:22,210
some,

1458
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:23,890
some wins and some losses.

1459
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:24,910
He fought well,

1460
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:25,391
you know,

1461
00:40:25,391 --> 00:40:26,680
all throughout his career.

1462
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,170
But that was the first fight where
it looked like he really just,

1463
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,090
he was on another level,

1464
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:33,460
the guy who was fighting just done
a completely different league.

1465
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:36,580
And a big part of that was Anderson
controlling him and the Thai clinch

1466
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:37,900
controlling him and just,

1467
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:39,490
and then with knees,

1468
00:40:39,491 --> 00:40:39,790
his,

1469
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:40,640
his Thai clinch,

1470
00:40:40,641 --> 00:40:41,440
his death.

1471
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:41,950
Yeah.

1472
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:42,970
That's a strong guy.

1473
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,201
Plus he has one,

1474
00:40:44,201 --> 00:40:44,441
you know,

1475
00:40:44,441 --> 00:40:47,590
you don't get to have that kind
of one punch knockout power,

1476
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,161
you know,

1477
00:40:48,161 --> 00:40:50,410
and be able to submit guys
with triangles as well,

1478
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,760
unless you have some physical.

1479
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,260
How tall is Anderson?

1480
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:53,470
Uh,

1481
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:54,011
would you say?

1482
00:40:54,011 --> 00:40:54,431
Really?

1483
00:40:54,431 --> 00:40:54,671
Six.

1484
00:40:54,671 --> 00:40:55,030
Two.

1485
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:55,540
He's 60,

1486
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:55,901
not six.

1487
00:40:55,901 --> 00:40:56,440
Three,

1488
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,850
maybe six to whatever it says.

1489
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:01,120
How much shorter is he than Jon Jones?

1490
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,820
Jon is not just taller.

1491
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,630
John's just much bigger.

1492
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:05,350
You know,

1493
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:06,640
even if it's a two inch thing,

1494
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:07,781
that two inches.

1495
00:41:07,781 --> 00:41:09,190
This is a million miles.

1496
00:41:09,191 --> 00:41:09,760
Yeah.

1497
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,830
John is a big dude with those long arms.

1498
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,670
Yeah.

1499
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,800
John's a master at a distance.

1500
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,070
How about using the opposite?

1501
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:16,350
Like it's,

1502
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:19,330
so if you're a smaller guy and
you're dealing with a guy like John,

1503
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,840
he's gonna fuck you up at a
distance that you can't touch him.

1504
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:24,190
I mean he's the master at that.

1505
00:41:24,191 --> 00:41:25,900
If you watch his fight with Rashad Evans,

1506
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,970
you watch his fight with Quintin Jackson.

1507
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:31,610
He's the master at keeping guys
and the end of his shots like,

1508
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,530
and they come at him.

1509
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:33,320
Nope.

1510
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,071
On the shoulders,

1511
00:41:34,071 --> 00:41:35,000
pushes him off,

1512
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:35,931
kick to the leg,

1513
00:41:35,931 --> 00:41:36,740
pushes him off,

1514
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:37,820
back to my range,

1515
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,751
back to my range,

1516
00:41:38,751 --> 00:41:40,460
back to the range where
only he can hit you.

1517
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:40,731
Right.

1518
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:44,600
So he's like sniping at you and then
when you come out of him he just controls

1519
00:41:44,601 --> 00:41:44,960
you.

1520
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,180
And then on top of that he's
got the great wrestling.

1521
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,760
So it's like if you actually
do clinch up with them,

1522
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:50,630
guess what?

1523
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:52,340
He's ridiculously physically strong,

1524
00:41:52,341 --> 00:41:53,340
very technical,

1525
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,560
and he's a really good fucking wrestler.

1526
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:57,290
He's got some real skills.

1527
00:41:57,410 --> 00:41:58,610
Plus we'll do wild shit.

1528
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,151
You know,

1529
00:41:59,151 --> 00:41:59,290
he,

1530
00:41:59,290 --> 00:41:59,841
he'll like,

1531
00:41:59,841 --> 00:42:00,720
he'll throw dude.

1532
00:42:00,721 --> 00:42:01,880
So launch dudes for the hair.

1533
00:42:01,881 --> 00:42:03,080
Like people forget about that.

1534
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:04,550
He hasn't been doing that,

1535
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:05,180
you know?

1536
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:05,481
I mean,

1537
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:08,000
John was like smashing guys in
the beginning of his career.

1538
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,040
Like if you look the [inaudible] fight,

1539
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:13,370
like the first fight where Gustava
Dante is when he was in the UFC,

1540
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,200
he launched that dude.

1541
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:15,891
I mean,

1542
00:42:15,891 --> 00:42:16,641
launched him.

1543
00:42:16,641 --> 00:42:16,760
Yeah.

1544
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,330
It was like,

1545
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:20,480
it was crazy to why stronger than
people think it's not the right name.

1546
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:21,200
Yeah,

1547
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:21,441
no,

1548
00:42:21,441 --> 00:42:22,520
he's very strong.

1549
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:24,170
He's very strong.

1550
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:24,920
You know?

1551
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,191
Man,

1552
00:42:25,191 --> 00:42:27,080
that last fight was incredible.

1553
00:42:27,081 --> 00:42:28,100
Him and Gustafson,

1554
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,100
I was one of the most amazing fights,

1555
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:33,590
I think the most amazing
fight I've ever seen.

1556
00:42:33,591 --> 00:42:36,260
And that's saying a lot because
you've seen thousand fights.

1557
00:42:36,261 --> 00:42:36,411
Yeah,

1558
00:42:36,411 --> 00:42:37,340
I'm pretty sure it was.

1559
00:42:37,341 --> 00:42:37,730
I mean,

1560
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:38,030
it's,

1561
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:40,430
it's hard to say like
what's the most amazing,

1562
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,840
but it's certainly in right?

1563
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:43,401
Shocking,

1564
00:42:43,401 --> 00:42:43,641
right?

1565
00:42:43,641 --> 00:42:44,330
I mean,

1566
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:45,163
yeah.

1567
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:45,650
Yeah,

1568
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:46,550
it's right up there.

1569
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:47,570
Uh,

1570
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:48,890
I wonder how they're,

1571
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:51,440
how they're going to adjust their
training for this next fight.

1572
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:52,873
You know,

1573
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:53,400
uh,

1574
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,380
that's a good question.

1575
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,220
I know that I,

1576
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:57,440
I'm really looking forward
to the junior dos Santos,

1577
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:58,610
uh,

1578
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:00,990
Cain Velasquez fight because
John Gray goose mouth.

1579
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:01,910
That's who it was.

1580
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:04,120
It wasn't Gustavo Dante is cause
it's Tom looked down to as a,

1581
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,120
as a Jujitsu guy.

1582
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:05,461
My,

1583
00:43:05,461 --> 00:43:06,230
my apologist,

1584
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:07,460
it was Andre Goose Mallee farm.

1585
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:12,500
That was when he first started launching
people through the air spinning elbows.

1586
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:14,180
And it's just a few years ago,

1587
00:43:14,181 --> 00:43:14,481
man,

1588
00:43:14,481 --> 00:43:15,380
which is really weird.

1589
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:19,460
That was the 2008 credit
seems like last missing,

1590
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,271
it seems like three months.

1591
00:43:20,271 --> 00:43:20,870
Amazing.

1592
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:21,681
And I'll tell you what,

1593
00:43:21,681 --> 00:43:22,514
man,

1594
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:24,560
I've seen him in some tough fights.

1595
00:43:24,561 --> 00:43:25,700
I've seen him in some really good fights.

1596
00:43:25,701 --> 00:43:29,630
I've never seen anybody get that
close to him as as Gustafson did.

1597
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:29,901
Well,

1598
00:43:29,901 --> 00:43:32,780
the one thing I was when they lined up
and you and I were right there cage side,

1599
00:43:32,781 --> 00:43:34,010
the one thing I noticed was that he would,

1600
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:34,910
that goes Gustafson.

1601
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:35,763
It's taller.

1602
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,160
John is an inch taller.

1603
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:37,730
I was like,

1604
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:38,790
what are you talking about?

1605
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:40,343
Yeah.

1606
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:41,203
He's a big dude,

1607
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:42,650
dude.

1608
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:44,270
That kind of got a lot better.

1609
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:45,510
He got a little better.

1610
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,660
3.5% of Americans are,

1611
00:43:47,661 --> 00:43:51,300
I think it's that are our six
three are over in that crazy.

1612
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:52,180
There's um,

1613
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:55,340
an inside the UFC thing they're doing
about Gustafson when they showed him

1614
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:59,210
training a up for the fight and
the attitude that this guy has,

1615
00:43:59,211 --> 00:44:00,044
this guy's like,

1616
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:01,640
he's straight viking,

1617
00:44:01,641 --> 00:44:02,560
straight up fucking,

1618
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,960
it's all stoic is straight Vikki DNA.

1619
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:07,340
One of the things that he said,

1620
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,353
he said,

1621
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:09,680
I'm never satisfied.

1622
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:10,041
He goes,

1623
00:44:10,041 --> 00:44:10,721
the life of a,

1624
00:44:10,721 --> 00:44:12,560
an elite athlete is
you're never satisfied.

1625
00:44:12,561 --> 00:44:16,010
You can never be happy with what you did
because then you're going to get fucked

1626
00:44:16,011 --> 00:44:16,430
up.

1627
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:16,761
You know?

1628
00:44:16,761 --> 00:44:17,091
It was like,

1629
00:44:17,091 --> 00:44:19,060
that was his attitude every day,

1630
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:20,540
no matter how dominant he is.

1631
00:44:20,541 --> 00:44:20,721
Like,

1632
00:44:20,721 --> 00:44:21,110
and that,

1633
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:23,630
that was like how he seemed
like after his fight,

1634
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:25,310
like after his fight it was like,

1635
00:44:25,311 --> 00:44:25,551
you know,

1636
00:44:25,551 --> 00:44:25,791
hey,

1637
00:44:25,791 --> 00:44:26,151
you know,

1638
00:44:26,151 --> 00:44:27,110
it was what it was.

1639
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:27,970
And you know,

1640
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:29,150
John's a good fighter and that's it.

1641
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:30,051
That's how me,

1642
00:44:30,051 --> 00:44:31,680
he let it go on moving on.

1643
00:44:31,681 --> 00:44:32,310
But he,

1644
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:35,370
I think he realizes that this is
the part of a trilogy that you know,

1645
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,500
no time to relax.

1646
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:39,300
Well I wish they would
just get right after it.

1647
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:39,730
I mean I,

1648
00:44:39,730 --> 00:44:40,340
I,

1649
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:40,830
I,

1650
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:43,980
I'm torn because I really want
to see Glover versus John.

1651
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:48,180
I think that's a really interesting
fight and Glover is a fucking killer.

1652
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,260
He's a killer.

1653
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:51,450
That guy's dangerous.

1654
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:52,890
Glover is very,

1655
00:44:52,891 --> 00:44:53,281
very,

1656
00:44:53,281 --> 00:44:53,701
very,

1657
00:44:53,701 --> 00:44:55,230
very highly on the wrestling team too.

1658
00:44:55,231 --> 00:44:57,030
He's a wrestler as well
as did you described,

1659
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:02,260
could have easily been a world champion
by now and in any other way class with

1660
00:45:02,431 --> 00:45:03,780
any other set of circumstances.

1661
00:45:03,781 --> 00:45:07,110
If he had been in the UFC earlier and
had a chance to fight against higher

1662
00:45:07,111 --> 00:45:08,610
levels of competition just six,

1663
00:45:08,611 --> 00:45:09,570
seven years ago,

1664
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,740
he could have been a champion.

1665
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,030
That's no bullshit.

1666
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:13,171
That's legit.

1667
00:45:13,171 --> 00:45:15,300
He had a v a big time visa issue.

1668
00:45:15,301 --> 00:45:16,700
But if you look at like the,

1669
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:20,790
the highest level guys who knows who's
going to win when they get in there,

1670
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,980
but you all know who the top guys are.

1671
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,580
And on any given night in a
lot of search circumstances,

1672
00:45:26,581 --> 00:45:28,110
like the hundred 70 pound division,

1673
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,880
George dominates that division,

1674
00:45:29,881 --> 00:45:30,061
right?

1675
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:31,440
Georgia has been beating everybody,

1676
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:36,770
but the reality is he's surrounded by a
bunch of murderers everywhere he turns,

1677
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,810
and at any given day,

1678
00:45:39,811 --> 00:45:41,010
one of those guys could get them.

1679
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:42,750
Carlos condit almost got him.

1680
00:45:42,751 --> 00:45:44,220
He had kicked him and dropped him.

1681
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,510
Matt Serra got him.

1682
00:45:45,511 --> 00:45:47,430
He was the only guy to ever
really get them like that.

1683
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:48,000
Matt,

1684
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,050
Matt Hughes got him,

1685
00:45:49,051 --> 00:45:50,880
caught him in an arm bar
back early in his career.

1686
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:51,210
Yeah.

1687
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:55,950
But when you look at like the
amount of murderers in his division,

1688
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:57,210
it makes you realize how good he is.

1689
00:45:57,530 --> 00:45:57,810
I mean,

1690
00:45:57,810 --> 00:46:00,600
Carlos condit is as good as it gets.

1691
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:01,710
Even better now.

1692
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:03,200
I know it's even better now.

1693
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:05,070
He's even better now.

1694
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:06,630
He got that loss,

1695
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:08,430
made him take it to the next level.

1696
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:08,670
He's,

1697
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:09,090
he's,

1698
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:10,320
he's just phenomenal.

1699
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,210
That's his fucking last fight.

1700
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:12,600
So good.

1701
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,410
Martin Kampmann.

1702
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:14,310
He's a beautiful man.

1703
00:46:14,311 --> 00:46:14,660
I mean,

1704
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:15,170
I was,

1705
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:15,750
I watched,

1706
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:16,860
I watched this fight with Gis.

1707
00:46:16,861 --> 00:46:17,740
I was rooting for DSG.

1708
00:46:17,741 --> 00:46:19,770
I Love des because Nick Diaz is my hero.

1709
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:21,330
I just love his attitude and,

1710
00:46:21,331 --> 00:46:26,331
and every single girl that is watching
Carlos Condit faluting mine is literally

1711
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:29,281
go wide.

1712
00:46:29,281 --> 00:46:29,451
And,

1713
00:46:29,451 --> 00:46:30,010
and I,

1714
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:30,231
I,

1715
00:46:30,231 --> 00:46:30,901
I literally,

1716
00:46:30,901 --> 00:46:32,600
I felt bad about myself
and jealous and I was,

1717
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,080
I could have been
rooting for content more.

1718
00:46:34,081 --> 00:46:35,790
And then I watched them just
keep turning that corner.

1719
00:46:35,791 --> 00:46:36,150
I was like,

1720
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:37,080
you got to give it to this guy.

1721
00:46:37,081 --> 00:46:38,910
He's like a bonafide new Mexican cowboy.

1722
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:39,600
He sure has.

1723
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:40,620
Man Wash Stud.

1724
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:42,270
He's a bad motherfucker.

1725
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:43,081
He's getting better.

1726
00:46:43,081 --> 00:46:43,530
For sure.

1727
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:45,450
Genetically he's got much
longer legs than I do,

1728
00:46:45,451 --> 00:46:45,720
sir.

1729
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:45,811
Oh,

1730
00:46:45,811 --> 00:46:46,644
he's very tall.

1731
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:50,010
He's very tall and he knows
how to use it and he's,

1732
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:50,850
he's,

1733
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:53,940
one of the things that he has it a
lot of people don't talk about is his

1734
00:46:53,941 --> 00:46:54,774
fitness.

1735
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,630
His fitness level is like very elite.

1736
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,880
The pace that he could keep in a fight.

1737
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:01,380
It's one of the things that he,

1738
00:47:01,381 --> 00:47:02,130
you know,

1739
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:04,110
one of the things that
always worked with Nick Diaz,

1740
00:47:04,111 --> 00:47:04,260
his,

1741
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:04,471
his,

1742
00:47:04,471 --> 00:47:06,180
his ability to outpace guys.

1743
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:06,690
So it's,

1744
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:08,580
there's times in a fight and it's,

1745
00:47:08,581 --> 00:47:09,750
if you've never fought before,

1746
00:47:09,751 --> 00:47:11,070
it's hard to imagine.

1747
00:47:11,071 --> 00:47:15,150
But there's times in a fight where one
guy is coasting or were you sort of

1748
00:47:15,151 --> 00:47:20,151
almost agree to coast or where you
know everybody relaxes the aggression a

1749
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:21,061
little bit.

1750
00:47:21,061 --> 00:47:21,960
Like in a tough fight.

1751
00:47:21,961 --> 00:47:23,960
25 minute fight happens and yeah,

1752
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:27,150
because you don't go 100%
you have to pace yourself.

1753
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,980
Well Nick Diaz can go just a little

1754
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,210
bit faster,

1755
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:35,560
a little bit longer and he can
go round after round of dry.

1756
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:37,330
He could do 30 minutes of MMA.

1757
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:38,920
It's called doing triathlons.

1758
00:47:38,921 --> 00:47:39,520
Exactly.

1759
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,100
It's called long training or overtraining.

1760
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:43,300
His masonic overtrading
caught long training.

1761
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:45,640
His endurance is insane.

1762
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:46,900
I mean it's insane.

1763
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:49,780
So he would just get on guys
like a guy like Paul daily.

1764
00:47:49,781 --> 00:47:51,270
Just get on him and stay on it.

1765
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:51,760
Yeah,

1766
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,630
just go after him.

1767
00:47:52,631 --> 00:47:53,464
Talk Shit.

1768
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:54,543
Boxers.

1769
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:57,160
The coaches would have you run
for an hour and a half slowly.

1770
00:47:57,161 --> 00:47:57,641
Not Long.

1771
00:47:57,641 --> 00:47:59,350
They keep your heart rate
up at a certain level.

1772
00:47:59,351 --> 00:48:00,700
It's kind of like triathlon training.

1773
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:02,770
Back in the day as a boxer,

1774
00:48:02,771 --> 00:48:03,431
they would make you,

1775
00:48:03,431 --> 00:48:04,151
if you're running a fighting,

1776
00:48:04,151 --> 00:48:05,110
a 15 round fight,

1777
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:05,973
good luck.

1778
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:09,340
They would make you literally run for
an hour and a half to two hours and it

1779
00:48:09,341 --> 00:48:10,330
wouldn't be long running.

1780
00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:12,880
I wouldn't be hard running
but it would be running.

1781
00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:14,163
And what,

1782
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:18,190
they never really found a substitute
for that particular kind of training for

1783
00:48:18,191 --> 00:48:18,251
it,

1784
00:48:18,251 --> 00:48:22,000
for fighting because it puts
you into a cardiovascular state,

1785
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:22,660
uh,

1786
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:23,920
where where you will,

1787
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:26,860
you will be able to sustain for
set for a long time and man,

1788
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,320
just having been arrested
or six minutes is,

1789
00:48:29,321 --> 00:48:32,350
is an Aeon nine minutes in
college freestyle is a nightmare.

1790
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,190
Um,

1791
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:34,660
I can't imagine 15,

1792
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:35,980
I can't imagine 25 minutes.

1793
00:48:35,981 --> 00:48:37,360
When you're mixing and punching,

1794
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:39,240
it's,

1795
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:40,750
it's truly,

1796
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:41,920
you truly have to be,

1797
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:42,690
you know,

1798
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:42,840
a,

1799
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:43,651
a freak and,

1800
00:48:43,651 --> 00:48:47,710
and even being able to your vo Max
being some people just either have it or

1801
00:48:47,711 --> 00:48:47,981
don't.

1802
00:48:47,981 --> 00:48:52,981
That's another genetic thing where you
can either use oxygen more efficiently

1803
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:55,330
when you're boxing,

1804
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,193
wrestling,

1805
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:56,951
cycling,

1806
00:48:56,951 --> 00:48:57,784
running.

1807
00:48:57,790 --> 00:49:02,350
Some people just convert auction in a
much more efficient manner into their red

1808
00:49:02,351 --> 00:49:03,040
blood cells.

1809
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,630
Then do other people.

1810
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:07,600
So your vo Max can be worked on for sure.

1811
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:07,931
And you can,

1812
00:49:07,931 --> 00:49:09,650
you can increase your cardiovascular risk.

1813
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:11,410
But some people just have a jump on it,

1814
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:12,190
you know,

1815
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:13,830
like depending on what
your genetic makeup,

1816
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:14,771
when you know,

1817
00:49:14,771 --> 00:49:18,190
there's a really funny bill burb bit
were Bill Berwin on Conan O'brien and it

1818
00:49:18,191 --> 00:49:21,760
was talking about Lance
Armstrong loved it.

1819
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:22,841
I loved it.

1820
00:49:22,841 --> 00:49:23,651
Pull that shit up.

1821
00:49:23,651 --> 00:49:24,920
Pull that shit up with play that,

1822
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:27,550
cause it's hilarious because
it's so fucking true.

1823
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:31,090
Bill burr on Kona talking
about Lance Armstrong.

1824
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:32,230
It's genius.

1825
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:34,690
It's not sociopath like yeah,

1826
00:49:34,691 --> 00:49:36,200
well it's his,

1827
00:49:36,201 --> 00:49:38,110
his take on it is so dead on.

1828
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,240
Like they're all on drugs.

1829
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:44,590
Everybody was on drugs like
my friend and your friend,

1830
00:49:44,591 --> 00:49:45,101
you know the guy.

1831
00:49:45,101 --> 00:49:45,431
We won't,

1832
00:49:45,431 --> 00:49:46,300
we don't have to say his name.

1833
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:46,890
Uh,

1834
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:47,230
who was,

1835
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:47,640
uh,

1836
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,570
it was a pro cycler at one point in time.

1837
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:51,850
He knew about this.

1838
00:49:51,851 --> 00:49:54,430
He's always said this
like way back in the day.

1839
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:54,971
He was like,

1840
00:49:54,971 --> 00:49:55,240
look,

1841
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:56,260
they're all on trucks.

1842
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,160
Cause I was on it.

1843
00:49:57,340 --> 00:49:58,390
Everybody in the team was on it.

1844
00:49:58,391 --> 00:49:58,571
He goes,

1845
00:49:58,571 --> 00:50:02,050
you would hear guys get off the bus in
the middle of the night and unrack their

1846
00:50:02,051 --> 00:50:05,050
bike cause they had to go running
because their EPO was making them fucking

1847
00:50:05,051 --> 00:50:05,680
crazy.

1848
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:06,400
God,

1849
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:06,761
yeah,

1850
00:50:06,761 --> 00:50:07,421
whatever it does,

1851
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:10,450
it makes your heartbeat funny and
you start feeling weird and you're,

1852
00:50:10,451 --> 00:50:10,810
you're,

1853
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:12,550
you're basically gumming up your fucking,

1854
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:14,050
you gotta you gotta blow out some,

1855
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:14,830
some blood.

1856
00:50:14,830 --> 00:50:15,160
Yeah,

1857
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:15,993
that's exactly right.

1858
00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:17,580
That's exactly right.

1859
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:17,861
And,

1860
00:50:17,861 --> 00:50:18,280
and my,

1861
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:21,070
my problem with with
Lance Armstrong was that,

1862
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:22,750
not that he even did drugs,

1863
00:50:22,751 --> 00:50:26,550
but that he destroyed other people who
accused him of doing drugs and he got

1864
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:27,590
lawsuits and everything else.

1865
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:28,460
Yeah.

1866
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:29,160
He used,

1867
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,520
he was a bad influence and money to,

1868
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:33,710
to do harm to the bad guy.

1869
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,200
And people who were calling him out on it,

1870
00:50:36,201 --> 00:50:38,420
we're calling them out because
they wanted everyone to be,

1871
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:39,110
you know.

1872
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:40,360
Well there are also some point in time,

1873
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,270
some of them were subpoenaed,

1874
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:42,260
some of them didn't have a choice.

1875
00:50:42,261 --> 00:50:43,094
They were brought up on,

1876
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:43,700
you know,

1877
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:44,061
when you're,

1878
00:50:44,061 --> 00:50:45,230
when the u s government's going,

1879
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:45,530
you know,

1880
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:46,311
you better tell the truth.

1881
00:50:46,311 --> 00:50:46,971
You're going to jail,

1882
00:50:46,971 --> 00:50:47,870
you're going to tell the truth.

1883
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,430
And this is what the,

1884
00:50:49,431 --> 00:50:49,671
you know,

1885
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:53,240
the argument against it or the personal
freedom argument I don't think really

1886
00:50:53,241 --> 00:50:55,940
works in this one because I think you
have to know exactly what's there,

1887
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:58,670
what everyone's doing to find
out if it in fact it's safe.

1888
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:03,140
Because when you're dealing with this
is an extraordinarily dirty sport,

1889
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:05,050
extraordinarily dirty,

1890
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:10,090
like perhaps 90 plus percent of the top
people and 100% of the winners are doing

1891
00:51:10,911 --> 00:51:11,630
something.

1892
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:12,920
They're taking blood out of their body,

1893
00:51:12,921 --> 00:51:14,210
they're putting it back in their body.

1894
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:15,980
That's super common.

1895
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:17,150
They like to do that one.

1896
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:17,441
They,

1897
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:17,750
uh,

1898
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:18,950
they elect to use EPO,

1899
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:20,750
which does the same
thing through a chemical.

1900
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,280
They're all on testosterone.

1901
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:22,881
They're the,

1902
00:51:22,881 --> 00:51:27,740
and it's actually been argued that
it's safer to do the Tour de France.

1903
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:28,430
No.

1904
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:29,263
So I say France.

1905
00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:30,680
It was beautiful.

1906
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:31,390
Right?

1907
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:32,223
We're all done.

1908
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:34,520
That's amazing that you just did that.

1909
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:36,710
I never would have
expected them to do that.

1910
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:37,521
That's awesome.

1911
00:51:37,521 --> 00:51:38,860
The Tour de France would it flows.

1912
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:39,321
Like I said,

1913
00:51:39,321 --> 00:51:40,860
no Chaddam one time and said no,

1914
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:47,390
this one doctor was saying
that it actually might be
safer to do it on the drugs

1915
00:51:47,421 --> 00:51:50,360
then to do it off it because it's such
a strain on your body when you do it

1916
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,400
without the reserves.

1917
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:55,700
So talking about like it's all about
your ability to recover from what you're

1918
00:51:55,701 --> 00:51:58,730
putting out and how much can you put
out and how much can you recover and how

1919
00:51:58,731 --> 00:51:59,780
well do you know your body?

1920
00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:01,070
What a certain point points time.

1921
00:52:01,071 --> 00:52:04,780
These guys were in running a little late
thirties and they were covering like he

1922
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,930
like young pups,

1923
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,280
like 18 year olds.

1924
00:52:07,281 --> 00:52:08,720
You ever see an 18 year old get a scratch?

1925
00:52:08,721 --> 00:52:09,800
It's gone tomorrow.

1926
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:10,761
They just,

1927
00:52:10,761 --> 00:52:11,594
he loved the,

1928
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:12,580
they're like the Wolverine.

1929
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:13,370
Other heal.

1930
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:13,551
Well,

1931
00:52:13,551 --> 00:52:14,660
do you remember how your hard,

1932
00:52:14,661 --> 00:52:19,190
your Dick was always hard when you were
18 like those levels of hormones are

1933
00:52:19,191 --> 00:52:20,390
never reached again.

1934
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:21,141
I never forgot.

1935
00:52:21,141 --> 00:52:21,974
One time I was,

1936
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,090
I was thinking about this girl.

1937
00:52:23,091 --> 00:52:23,840
There's like young lists.

1938
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:24,680
It's like 23.

1939
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:25,641
I was in New York,

1940
00:52:25,641 --> 00:52:29,710
I was on my way to theater
class and I'm walking down like,

1941
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:30,800
like Alexa,

1942
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:32,070
and I'm just thinking about this.

1943
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:32,601
Yeah,

1944
00:52:32,601 --> 00:52:33,170
this girl.

1945
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:36,200
And I start getting a fucking
Chubby as I'm walking.

1946
00:52:36,201 --> 00:52:38,810
I was wearing these pants
and I hear this big,

1947
00:52:38,811 --> 00:52:40,850
very gay black man go,

1948
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:41,750
oh,

1949
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:42,583
he got,

1950
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:50,540
he started and he started
walking along with me,

1951
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:53,030
looking at packages is handicapped,

1952
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:53,920
will look and go on.

1953
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:56,660
And he was just so into me and I was like,

1954
00:52:56,661 --> 00:52:57,171
I gotta get,

1955
00:52:57,171 --> 00:53:00,560
I gotta get this thing down right
now and I got to get out of here.

1956
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:03,860
It was that he followed me for a
block and gay guys would hit on,

1957
00:53:03,861 --> 00:53:05,540
and you just like guys will hit on girls.

1958
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:10,200
He got to know everybody who
thinks that because someone's gay,

1959
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:10,410
you know,

1960
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:10,580
I've,

1961
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:13,160
I've actually been talking about this on
stage that they're automatically going

1962
00:53:13,161 --> 00:53:13,994
to be nice.

1963
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:14,833
You're crazy.

1964
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:16,550
Like that's a person.

1965
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:17,543
God Damn Right.

1966
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,980
Everybody should get their first,

1967
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:19,240
uh,

1968
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:20,073
you know,

1969
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:21,380
blank slate.

1970
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:22,243
I agree with that.

1971
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:22,491
Gay,

1972
00:53:22,491 --> 00:53:22,941
straight,

1973
00:53:22,941 --> 00:53:23,271
black,

1974
00:53:23,271 --> 00:53:23,630
white,

1975
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:24,463
Asian,

1976
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:25,543
whatever,

1977
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:25,931
whatever,

1978
00:53:25,931 --> 00:53:26,340
whatever.

1979
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:27,173
Who Cares?

1980
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:28,860
He's a complicated human beings.

1981
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:30,720
The rest of it gets real freaky.

1982
00:53:30,721 --> 00:53:32,700
Just cause you suck dicks
doesn't mean you're awesome.

1983
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:33,370
Fuck No.

1984
00:53:33,370 --> 00:53:34,203
Nor does it mean you're,

1985
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:37,260
you're ethical that he won't
tackle you with the knees.

1986
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:37,531
Yeah.

1987
00:53:37,531 --> 00:53:39,450
There's a lot of weird
people out there period.

1988
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:45,810
I'm sure there are guys you
know that look at you and go,

1989
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:46,800
you know there are probably,

1990
00:53:46,801 --> 00:53:47,840
there are gay rapists,

1991
00:53:47,841 --> 00:53:49,320
like they are straight rapists.

1992
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:49,791
I mean it,

1993
00:53:49,791 --> 00:53:50,011
it,

1994
00:53:50,011 --> 00:53:54,420
all the whole human spectrum
exists within whatever you are.

1995
00:53:54,430 --> 00:53:55,263
What else?

1996
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:56,940
I mean if there's bad people,

1997
00:53:56,941 --> 00:53:58,800
there's bad people in
every single walk of life.

1998
00:53:59,190 --> 00:53:59,431
It's,

1999
00:53:59,431 --> 00:54:01,860
there's all sorts of possible
combinations of people,

2000
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:02,753
how they turn out,

2001
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:05,490
but you know that those days,

2002
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,190
those hormone days of the 18 like that.

2003
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:10,230
Like I look back on that
sometimes and I'm like,

2004
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:13,500
how was I ever expected to
make decisions for myself?

2005
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:18,270
Back then I was just raised
hormonal mess as was.

2006
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:21,150
Everyone was friends with the greatest,

2007
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:24,420
you have the greatest metaphor
I've ever heard in my life.

2008
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:28,440
One of the greatest bits I've ever
actually in my life seen anywhere.

2009
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:30,730
To me that the eye,

2010
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:34,710
what it's like for a guy to have a hard
on these younger is like you're in the

2011
00:54:34,711 --> 00:54:39,240
back of a boss and somebody
else is driving that bus
and that whole bit you did

2012
00:54:39,241 --> 00:54:40,074
to me,

2013
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,140
top five greatest spits of all time.

2014
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:44,401
I don't have that on there.

2015
00:54:44,401 --> 00:54:45,430
Anything you don't,

2016
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:46,740
oh my God,

2017
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:47,610
you're crazy.

2018
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,290
That's a genius.

2019
00:54:49,291 --> 00:54:52,740
But that's like that's a bit I got
a lazy with and I sort of abandoned.

2020
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:54,410
I would have it and I'd let it go.

2021
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:55,201
I blew my mind.

2022
00:54:55,201 --> 00:54:56,830
That was what I was literally like,

2023
00:54:56,831 --> 00:54:57,690
it was so inspiring.

2024
00:54:57,691 --> 00:54:58,770
I went home and I started writing.

2025
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:00,030
I did it.

2026
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:01,410
It's funny cause that bit was a bit,

2027
00:55:01,411 --> 00:55:04,650
that would work really well or there
was too many dance moves in it.

2028
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:06,060
That's what Tom Segura calls it.

2029
00:55:06,061 --> 00:55:07,140
When you're jazzing up a bit,

2030
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:07,690
whatever,

2031
00:55:07,690 --> 00:55:08,010
Dude,

2032
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:09,030
you got your physical.

2033
00:55:09,031 --> 00:55:09,351
But that,

2034
00:55:09,351 --> 00:55:09,721
that thing,

2035
00:55:09,721 --> 00:55:12,180
I don't care how many dance moves you're
doing that anybody doesn't think that's

2036
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:12,780
genius.

2037
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:13,650
And by the way,

2038
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:16,740
it may just be that it's so good people
that are actually just watching cause I

2039
00:55:16,741 --> 00:55:17,580
wasn't even laughing.

2040
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:22,320
Most of that was watching it so fascinated
with the metaphor and how you were

2041
00:55:22,321 --> 00:55:23,460
doing it that I was just like,

2042
00:55:23,461 --> 00:55:24,820
this is the greatest thing
I've ever seen him on.

2043
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:26,650
So you know,

2044
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:27,680
I'll put it on some,

2045
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:28,980
I'll put it on the next year.

2046
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:31,620
It's too late.

2047
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:32,401
Come on.

2048
00:55:32,401 --> 00:55:33,510
It'll be a baby it to me.

2049
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:34,890
I want to do it on my next special,

2050
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:36,360
which I'm shooting in January.

2051
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,440
I think we're going to shoot it.

2052
00:55:37,590 --> 00:55:38,070
I think.

2053
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:38,761
I don't know yet,

2054
00:55:38,761 --> 00:55:41,700
but I have an offer to do
it down in Orange County.

2055
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:42,720
Oh cool.

2056
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:43,260
Yeah.

2057
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:43,890
But uh,

2058
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:44,131
you know,

2059
00:55:44,131 --> 00:55:44,880
we'll see.

2060
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:45,570
I'm trying to,

2061
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:48,450
I'm trying to do way
more comedy clubs then.

2062
00:55:48,451 --> 00:55:49,201
That's the greatest.

2063
00:55:49,201 --> 00:55:49,830
Yeah,

2064
00:55:49,830 --> 00:55:50,460
I'm been,

2065
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:52,020
the last couple of weeks I've been doing,

2066
00:55:52,021 --> 00:55:53,190
I did a bunch of the Improv's.

2067
00:55:53,191 --> 00:55:55,080
I did Braya Ontario,

2068
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:59,370
I did the comedy Magic Club and doing
all these club dates and I'm having so

2069
00:55:59,371 --> 00:56:00,181
much fun,

2070
00:56:00,181 --> 00:56:00,541
man.

2071
00:56:00,541 --> 00:56:01,374
I'm like,

2072
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:06,680
it's really like the shows or the intimacy
of the room is something I'm really

2073
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:09,210
like in love with.

2074
00:56:09,211 --> 00:56:09,660
Again,

2075
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:11,970
I was in Springfield,

2076
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:12,661
Illinois,

2077
00:56:12,661 --> 00:56:13,050
which is,

2078
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:14,760
I'm sorry to everybody from Springfield.

2079
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:17,460
It's not a place you'd
go for really anything.

2080
00:56:17,461 --> 00:56:18,330
How rude.

2081
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:18,541
No,

2082
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:19,060
it's but,

2083
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:20,760
but the people are great because
they all grew up together.

2084
00:56:20,761 --> 00:56:22,050
They all know each
other since fifth grade,

2085
00:56:22,051 --> 00:56:23,110
so it's a really great community.

2086
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,220
Fucking great

2087
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:24,890
crowds.

2088
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:25,300
Good luck.

2089
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:26,080
Yes.

2090
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:26,630
Yes.

2091
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:30,160
Money around town is banging people
that fucked up the high school and now

2092
00:56:30,161 --> 00:56:31,150
you're married to somebody else,

2093
00:56:31,151 --> 00:56:32,200
but you lived down the street.

2094
00:56:32,201 --> 00:56:33,040
There's one drink,

2095
00:56:33,041 --> 00:56:33,880
walks a log.

2096
00:56:33,881 --> 00:56:34,714
What do you doing?

2097
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:35,951
Well,

2098
00:56:35,951 --> 00:56:36,341
they don't get,

2099
00:56:36,341 --> 00:56:38,890
the problem is they all complain about
the fact that you can't get away with

2100
00:56:38,891 --> 00:56:40,030
anything because everybody knows you,

2101
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:42,100
so you have to be on your
best behavior all the time.

2102
00:56:42,101 --> 00:56:43,180
You can't be anonymous,

2103
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:44,590
which was really interesting.

2104
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:47,230
So it's like a small scale
model of the future Internet.

2105
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:49,990
That's exactly right.

2106
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:51,490
It's like a giant Facebook,

2107
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:53,440
but he's bagging everybody.

2108
00:56:53,441 --> 00:56:54,260
Everybody knows it.

2109
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:55,840
Everybody is watching everything you do.

2110
00:56:56,110 --> 00:56:56,943
But I was thinking,

2111
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:00,010
I love going on the road like that
because you had these intimate experiences

2112
00:57:00,011 --> 00:57:01,960
with a bunch of strangers and,

2113
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,550
and because there's not a lot to do.

2114
00:57:03,551 --> 00:57:05,020
I'm sitting there writing the whole time.

2115
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:07,810
It's interesting too when
you're talking about that,

2116
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:10,960
about this small town and
everybody knowing everybody.

2117
00:57:11,290 --> 00:57:15,340
You know Dr Chris Ryan who've had on
this podcast for the guy who wrote that

2118
00:57:15,341 --> 00:57:16,330
book sex at dawn,

2119
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:20,080
when he talks about like promiscuity,

2120
00:57:20,081 --> 00:57:22,120
like he talks about promiscuity
and primitive cultures,

2121
00:57:22,121 --> 00:57:23,980
which is basically fact,

2122
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:25,083
okay.

2123
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:29,620
What they're basing it on is almost
the same thing as a small town.

2124
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,950
It's everybody knowing everybody
there in these small groups,

2125
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:35,110
everybody knows everybody and
everybody fucks everybody.

2126
00:57:35,111 --> 00:57:35,620
That's right.

2127
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:36,670
And it happens all the time.

2128
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:37,031
He does,

2129
00:57:37,031 --> 00:57:37,271
right?

2130
00:57:37,271 --> 00:57:37,780
It happens.

2131
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:39,550
It happens all the time.

2132
00:57:39,551 --> 00:57:42,160
That's what happens when you get
down to a group of 50 people.

2133
00:57:42,610 --> 00:57:44,410
And they found that even,

2134
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,360
even as crazy as this sounds,

2135
00:57:46,361 --> 00:57:50,530
that small groups of people that are
involved in dangerous situations,

2136
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:53,950
they turned to wife swapping
like fighter pilots.

2137
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:54,610
Wow.

2138
00:57:54,610 --> 00:57:56,140
Fighter pilots on a regular basis.

2139
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:56,681
Wife swap,

2140
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:57,520
cop's wife swap.

2141
00:57:57,521 --> 00:57:58,061
So really?

2142
00:57:58,061 --> 00:57:58,630
Yeah.

2143
00:57:58,630 --> 00:58:02,830
Because they love their
wife and if they're dead,

2144
00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:04,990
they want someone else
to love their wife too.

2145
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:06,100
That makes total sense.

2146
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:09,820
And they want to be there while
like almost while it's happening,

2147
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:11,500
like you introduce someone to your wife.

2148
00:58:11,501 --> 00:58:13,000
She's really special person and like,

2149
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:18,190
like he's like almost like accepted a
new reality and that reality is my lights

2150
00:58:18,191 --> 00:58:19,450
are going to shut out any second now,

2151
00:58:19,690 --> 00:58:19,890
dude,

2152
00:58:19,890 --> 00:58:23,860
I'd way rather have you married my wife
and raising my kids in anybody else.

2153
00:58:23,861 --> 00:58:25,060
I know that feeling.

2154
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:25,953
You know what I'm talking about.

2155
00:58:26,050 --> 00:58:26,883
That's that feeling,

2156
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:28,860
that feeling is that says to me,

2157
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:30,640
you would know that I could trust.

2158
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:32,290
You can trust me and you know,

2159
00:58:32,291 --> 00:58:33,300
or vice versa.

2160
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:34,134
I can trust you.

2161
00:58:34,330 --> 00:58:35,380
That's life man.

2162
00:58:35,410 --> 00:58:37,390
That's what people do when
they get to small groups,

2163
00:58:37,391 --> 00:58:41,050
they bond job and they breed with each
other in order to form love bonds at.

2164
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:44,290
So it's more about love than
it is about being a freak.

2165
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:49,810
And the weird thing about that word
promiscuity is the original origin of the

2166
00:58:49,811 --> 00:58:51,610
word means mixed,

2167
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:52,600
mixed sex,

2168
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:53,411
sex with you,

2169
00:58:53,411 --> 00:58:54,310
sex with her.

2170
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:55,690
They were fucking each other.

2171
00:58:55,691 --> 00:58:56,860
They're having gay sex,

2172
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:58,870
like a lot of people throughout history,

2173
00:58:58,871 --> 00:59:01,480
we're having gay sex then
that's absolutely fact.

2174
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:03,850
And that's one of the
interesting things about luck.

2175
00:59:04,110 --> 00:59:04,520
You know,

2176
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:05,380
and I'm just talking here,

2177
00:59:05,381 --> 00:59:06,820
I'm not advocating gay sacks,

2178
00:59:07,150 --> 00:59:08,770
but what I am saying is damn it,

2179
00:59:09,410 --> 00:59:13,480
it's very strange that
in groups of of men,

2180
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:18,340
when men were warring and when they
were off like fighting and wars and

2181
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:20,980
disappearing together and
through the woods for six months,

2182
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:22,070
they were out

2183
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:24,100
banging each other and killing each other.

2184
00:59:24,101 --> 00:59:24,570
Yeah.

2185
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:26,510
I mean they were just killing each other.

2186
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,430
They were banging each other too.

2187
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:28,881
That was the,

2188
00:59:28,881 --> 00:59:30,380
I was the idea behind the Spartans are,

2189
00:59:30,381 --> 00:59:30,621
you know,

2190
00:59:30,621 --> 00:59:33,020
a lot of cultures that separated
men and women for a long time.

2191
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,130
There's a great deal of,

2192
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:34,341
you know,

2193
00:59:34,341 --> 00:59:35,690
because guys are fucking animals,

2194
00:59:35,691 --> 00:59:35,921
right?

2195
00:59:35,921 --> 00:59:38,550
So as you see some due to
smaller and kind of a feminine,

2196
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:38,930
you're like,

2197
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:40,310
I'm going to fuck that guy today.

2198
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:41,151
You know,

2199
00:59:41,151 --> 00:59:42,380
they didn't just do that.

2200
00:59:42,381 --> 00:59:45,730
They also formed love bonds because they
knew that they were most likely going

2201
00:59:45,731 --> 00:59:46,190
to die.

2202
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:48,620
I think when your reality
gets radically altered,

2203
00:59:48,621 --> 00:59:50,840
like you're in a situation
like a fighter pilot is,

2204
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:51,811
or like a,

2205
00:59:51,811 --> 00:59:54,380
a person who is perhaps going off to war,

2206
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:57,860
you're dealing with a very real
scenario of the end of your life.

2207
00:59:57,890 --> 00:59:58,550
It's really funny.

2208
00:59:58,550 --> 00:59:59,180
My buddies,

2209
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:00,080
one of the CIA,

2210
01:00:00,081 --> 01:00:01,010
paramilitary guys,

2211
01:00:01,011 --> 01:00:03,110
a real bad ass and he works with
all the special forces guys,

2212
01:00:03,111 --> 01:00:03,321
right?

2213
01:00:03,321 --> 01:00:05,000
Like the Delta guys and the seal team,

2214
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:07,160
six guys and the seals and
they were all up in arms.

2215
01:00:07,161 --> 01:00:07,370
He was,

2216
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:08,350
he was in their barracks and one,

2217
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,340
one of these groups to this
state that what they call a,

2218
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:11,181
a Cag,

2219
01:00:11,181 --> 01:00:12,410
a combat action group,

2220
01:00:12,411 --> 01:00:12,621
you know,

2221
01:00:12,621 --> 01:00:13,670
like break everything.

2222
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:15,153
Cag.

2223
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:17,540
And these guys are like a real bad ass,

2224
01:00:17,541 --> 01:00:18,141
like a triple,

2225
01:00:18,141 --> 01:00:18,771
triple nickel,

2226
01:00:18,771 --> 01:00:19,551
18 whatever,

2227
01:00:19,551 --> 01:00:20,210
you know.

2228
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:21,020
And uh,

2229
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:23,870
and they're all like the studs and they
were all like complaining about the

2230
01:00:23,871 --> 01:00:24,321
don't ask,

2231
01:00:24,321 --> 01:00:25,610
don't tell like gays in the military,

2232
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:27,310
father and me.

2233
01:00:27,311 --> 01:00:28,041
Well he looked at him,

2234
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:28,430
he was like,

2235
01:00:28,430 --> 01:00:29,360
you guys,

2236
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:31,940
you guys have Trojan call names.

2237
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:33,830
Just shave your forearms.

2238
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:34,431
You guys are,

2239
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:36,200
we're invest in nothing underneath.

2240
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:36,951
If you could,

2241
01:00:36,951 --> 01:00:38,240
you would frost your hair,

2242
01:00:38,241 --> 01:00:41,210
but there's no frosting
area and by the way,

2243
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:46,370
you guys are literally
spotting each other's hips as
you're doing slow grinding.

2244
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:48,830
Pullups oiling your muscles down.

2245
01:00:49,010 --> 01:00:49,860
This is the gay,

2246
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:52,610
there's not a girl within
fucking five miles.

2247
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:56,180
This is the guy you guys
have your appendant area
cause you're all top secret.

2248
01:00:56,330 --> 01:00:59,360
This is the gayest community
I've ever been a part of.

2249
01:00:59,361 --> 01:01:04,190
It's luck and all like really good
looking young muscular shit dudes who have

2250
01:01:04,191 --> 01:01:09,191
names like sparked Spartacus
and and and Achilles.

2251
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:09,891
Okay.

2252
01:01:09,891 --> 01:01:12,380
Break it down worldwide
in this day and age,

2253
01:01:12,650 --> 01:01:15,770
how much gay sex is going
on and during times of war,

2254
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:18,350
50% about gay sex.

2255
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:22,670
I know that if I was in a foxhole
or a prisoner of war camp with you,

2256
01:01:22,671 --> 01:01:23,990
I would probably,

2257
01:01:24,010 --> 01:01:24,940
I would probably,

2258
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:25,961
I go,

2259
01:01:25,961 --> 01:01:26,211
dude,

2260
01:01:26,211 --> 01:01:27,044
you smell it.

2261
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:28,700
Men Let me clean your back.

2262
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:29,660
I'm going to scrub your back.

2263
01:01:29,661 --> 01:01:31,850
Then you're all dirty on
your back area a few months.

2264
01:01:31,851 --> 01:01:32,684
He just give up.

2265
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:33,150
That's it.

2266
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:34,460
You just like in the woods.

2267
01:01:34,870 --> 01:01:37,760
I just never been attracted
to a dude is the only thing.

2268
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:40,580
Although it would have to be
a radical changing of your,

2269
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:41,000
uh,

2270
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,650
it's like when you start eating squirrels.

2271
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:43,873
Okay.

2272
01:01:44,610 --> 01:01:46,130
I try to stay alive here.

2273
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,360
He to scroll right now.

2274
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:48,320
Just nip his tail off.

2275
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:49,140
Rats.

2276
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:49,251
Well,

2277
01:01:49,251 --> 01:01:52,100
there are some parts of the world
actually they eat squirrels on a regular

2278
01:01:52,101 --> 01:01:52,680
basis.

2279
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:55,270
Squirrels are actually delicious though.

2280
01:01:55,310 --> 01:01:55,641
I mean,

2281
01:01:55,641 --> 01:01:58,790
there are a lot of like
groups that stay pretty,

2282
01:01:58,791 --> 01:01:59,900
I don't think there's a lot of,

2283
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:00,291
you know,

2284
01:02:00,291 --> 01:02:02,150
they say that like if you were in a gang,

2285
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:03,740
you're pretty much not fucking each other.

2286
01:02:03,741 --> 01:02:04,071
Let's do,

2287
01:02:04,071 --> 01:02:04,940
it's aren't fucking around.

2288
01:02:04,970 --> 01:02:05,691
I don't know about that.

2289
01:02:05,691 --> 01:02:06,260
I don't either.

2290
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:07,430
I don't want to say anything either.

2291
01:02:07,431 --> 01:02:07,941
I don't know.

2292
01:02:07,941 --> 01:02:08,120
Yeah,

2293
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:08,953
I don't want to either.

2294
01:02:09,290 --> 01:02:09,890
I don't know.

2295
01:02:09,890 --> 01:02:10,071
I,

2296
01:02:10,071 --> 01:02:10,610
you know,

2297
01:02:10,610 --> 01:02:12,110
I've always just joked around,

2298
01:02:12,111 --> 01:02:13,490
but it's a,

2299
01:02:14,090 --> 01:02:18,500
it's a weird thing that humans is more
flack that they morph and they just

2300
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:18,900
decide,

2301
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:19,141
okay,

2302
01:02:19,141 --> 01:02:19,800
now I'm gay.

2303
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:20,011
Well,

2304
01:02:20,011 --> 01:02:20,491
when men are,

2305
01:02:20,491 --> 01:02:21,660
you haven't noticed men.

2306
01:02:21,661 --> 01:02:22,950
When you get close to a guy,

2307
01:02:22,951 --> 01:02:24,480
if you were on a wrestling
team or you were on,

2308
01:02:24,481 --> 01:02:24,721
you know,

2309
01:02:24,721 --> 01:02:25,231
whatever you are,

2310
01:02:25,231 --> 01:02:27,690
have you watched like
an MMA guys in the back?

2311
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:28,500
You know when,

2312
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:30,400
when they're about to go to fight there,

2313
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:31,890
they're hugging and kissing each other.

2314
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:32,491
You know,

2315
01:02:32,491 --> 01:02:32,620
there,

2316
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:33,271
there's a deep,

2317
01:02:33,271 --> 01:02:35,540
deep bond that's formed with training and,

2318
01:02:35,541 --> 01:02:37,050
and going to war together like that.

2319
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:38,021
And they're,

2320
01:02:38,021 --> 01:02:38,351
they're,

2321
01:02:38,351 --> 01:02:39,360
they're kissing each other,

2322
01:02:39,361 --> 01:02:40,370
they're hugging each other.

2323
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:41,100
No,

2324
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:41,641
it's not.

2325
01:02:41,641 --> 01:02:45,930
But I'm saying that that develops
it very deep kinship bond.

2326
01:02:45,931 --> 01:02:47,580
And if my dick falls in your mouth,

2327
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:49,050
that in my opinion,

2328
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,550
is getting ready for a fight.

2329
01:02:50,590 --> 01:02:52,770
That does not mean well.

2330
01:02:52,771 --> 01:02:55,980
The idea would be that they would
fight harder for their lover.

2331
01:02:56,550 --> 01:02:56,850
You know,

2332
01:02:56,850 --> 01:02:57,840
that would be the idea.

2333
01:02:57,841 --> 01:02:59,280
The idea would be that they would fight.

2334
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:01,200
Look Achilles from homer Kelly,

2335
01:03:01,201 --> 01:03:03,450
the greatest warrior
of mythological times.

2336
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:04,351
His,

2337
01:03:04,351 --> 01:03:05,430
his lover's killed.

2338
01:03:05,431 --> 01:03:06,031
He had a lover.

2339
01:03:06,031 --> 01:03:08,690
He had a male lover and
Alexander the great had.

2340
01:03:08,710 --> 01:03:10,740
Adam has his best friend and lover.

2341
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:13,490
He killed him apparently when
he was drunk in a drunken rage.

2342
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:17,580
But that was his lover that a lot
of the great fighters and warriors

2343
01:03:17,581 --> 01:03:18,630
traditionally were gay.

2344
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:19,080
Yeah.

2345
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:19,710
It's amazing.

2346
01:03:19,710 --> 01:03:20,190
Yeah.

2347
01:03:20,190 --> 01:03:20,670
Why?

2348
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:22,590
Why did I Alexander lose his temper?

2349
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:23,371
He's only,

2350
01:03:23,371 --> 01:03:25,350
he only killed a few
thousand people before then.

2351
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:27,070
We're the de killed that guy fucking,

2352
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:29,460
I ain't know it conquered the world.

2353
01:03:29,490 --> 01:03:29,640
I mean,

2354
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,260
how many people did he
killed with his own hands?

2355
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:32,130
Well,

2356
01:03:32,130 --> 01:03:32,850
does it,

2357
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:34,200
they don't have anything about that,

2358
01:03:34,201 --> 01:03:37,440
but they do know that he was so strong
he could be in a full suit of armor and

2359
01:03:37,441 --> 01:03:38,490
jump up on his horse.

2360
01:03:38,491 --> 01:03:39,510
He was a short guy,

2361
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:41,250
but he was very powerfully built.

2362
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:45,630
What you could jump up onto that he
could literally launch himself on.

2363
01:03:45,631 --> 01:03:48,680
It was worth a lot of legendary
stories about [inaudible] shit.

2364
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:49,680
He was very strong.

2365
01:03:49,681 --> 01:03:53,970
He's very squat and think fuck
they two small polarize type.

2366
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:54,720
Yeah,

2367
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:55,250
that kind of builds.

2368
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:56,083
That's what I believe.

2369
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:57,420
Just short gorilla.

2370
01:03:57,421 --> 01:03:59,760
Like you see his shoulders [inaudible].

2371
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:00,180
Yeah.

2372
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:02,060
You know he's wanting went
down to one 70 for tonight's,

2373
01:04:02,070 --> 01:04:04,110
I don't know how he looked like death.

2374
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:05,910
It looked like death warmed over,

2375
01:04:06,630 --> 01:04:09,540
but looked Fulcan shredded pull,

2376
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:09,900
pull,

2377
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:10,740
pull up an image.

2378
01:04:10,741 --> 01:04:13,110
Paul Horez way in p a.

2379
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:15,750
L.

2380
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:15,750
H.

2381
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:15,750
A.

2382
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:15,750
R.

2383
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:15,750
E.

2384
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:15,750
S.

2385
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:19,650
Paul horror is weighing that you see
him at one 85 he looks like this giant

2386
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:22,800
Heman and now he's still really muscular.

2387
01:04:22,910 --> 01:04:23,910
So my is my weight.

2388
01:04:23,911 --> 01:04:25,140
I'm walking at one 70 right now.

2389
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,300
Imagine that he's shredded,

2390
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:28,583
shredded,

2391
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:30,590
and then he's going to rehydrate.

2392
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:35,600
He'll probably be at least 10
pounds plus heavier tomorrow,

2393
01:04:35,701 --> 01:04:36,534
so he must've,

2394
01:04:37,230 --> 01:04:38,490
you were saying that they,

2395
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:40,050
the way a lot of guys lose weight,

2396
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:43,210
they'll drink a lot of water and then
that's how you lose the water weight.

2397
01:04:43,230 --> 01:04:44,970
There's a lot of shit that has to happen.

2398
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:47,910
You have to get down to a certain
target weight before you can lose the

2399
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:48,750
Waterweight.

2400
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:52,320
Like if you're a like say
if you're a big strong guy.

2401
01:04:52,321 --> 01:04:52,501
Look,

2402
01:04:52,501 --> 01:04:56,430
Paul says there's a lot of extra
muscle going on there and you,

2403
01:04:56,490 --> 01:04:58,780
there's only one way to get
rid of that extra muscle.

2404
01:04:58,910 --> 01:04:59,310
The muscle,

2405
01:04:59,310 --> 01:04:59,880
you have to,

2406
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:00,620
you have to eat,

2407
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:01,470
do it slowly,

2408
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:05,190
or you have to make sure
that when you're eating,

2409
01:05:05,191 --> 01:05:06,960
you're taking in less
calories than you need.

2410
01:05:07,290 --> 01:05:08,820
Or if you take in less
calories that you need,

2411
01:05:08,821 --> 01:05:09,960
you buy starts to eat itself.

2412
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:10,231
Oh,

2413
01:05:10,231 --> 01:05:11,280
so you actually have to do,

2414
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,650
you do have to restrict
your calories that there's,

2415
01:05:13,890 --> 01:05:15,180
there are guys who have to do that.

2416
01:05:15,181 --> 01:05:17,860
It depends on how big you
are and how much you know.

2417
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:18,100
It's

2418
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:18,933
also like,

2419
01:05:19,030 --> 01:05:20,680
how'd you get that big like,

2420
01:05:20,681 --> 01:05:23,050
and are you still doing whatever
you were doing to get that big,

2421
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:23,291
you know,

2422
01:05:23,291 --> 01:05:23,830
like what's,

2423
01:05:23,830 --> 01:05:24,730
what are your hormones?

2424
01:05:24,731 --> 01:05:26,560
Are they being manipulated or the natural?

2425
01:05:26,710 --> 01:05:30,460
There's a lot of variables because the
assumption always is that someone is

2426
01:05:30,461 --> 01:05:31,690
innocent until proven guilty.

2427
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:35,560
So the assumption is always that
you're not doing anything unusual.

2428
01:05:35,561 --> 01:05:40,561
But when you see like a fucking
super strong muscular guy like that,

2429
01:05:41,770 --> 01:05:45,280
you always have to remember that there
have been people that have been caught

2430
01:05:45,281 --> 01:05:46,114
doing drugs.

2431
01:05:46,270 --> 01:05:47,170
There have been many,

2432
01:05:47,171 --> 01:05:47,501
many,

2433
01:05:47,501 --> 01:05:47,801
many,

2434
01:05:47,801 --> 01:05:48,221
many ones.

2435
01:05:48,221 --> 01:05:48,641
And in fact,

2436
01:05:48,641 --> 01:05:49,600
one of them was Paul Harris.

2437
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:52,120
He got caught with the
elevated testosterone levels.

2438
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:53,410
So I don't know who is,

2439
01:05:53,411 --> 01:05:54,290
and I dunno who isn't it?

2440
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:55,300
That's what it looks like now.

2441
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:58,420
God shredded.

2442
01:05:58,510 --> 01:05:58,841
I mean,

2443
01:05:58,841 --> 01:05:59,470
that's,

2444
01:05:59,470 --> 01:06:00,730
but when he got onto this is like,

2445
01:06:00,731 --> 01:06:02,290
he looks okay right there.

2446
01:06:02,310 --> 01:06:02,460
I,

2447
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:04,090
I imagine that's before he had his,

2448
01:06:04,091 --> 01:06:04,420
uh,

2449
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:05,440
his full,

2450
01:06:05,441 --> 01:06:06,274
uh,

2451
01:06:06,670 --> 01:06:07,503
your buddies,

2452
01:06:08,110 --> 01:06:08,610
my friend.

2453
01:06:08,610 --> 01:06:08,911
Your it,

2454
01:06:08,911 --> 01:06:09,431
how tall is he?

2455
01:06:09,431 --> 01:06:09,970
He's,

2456
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:10,800
he's like my,

2457
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,460
I probably maybe even shorter than me.

2458
01:06:12,461 --> 01:06:13,330
He might be a five,

2459
01:06:13,331 --> 01:06:14,164
seven.

2460
01:06:14,610 --> 01:06:15,190
He's,

2461
01:06:15,190 --> 01:06:16,480
he's such a tank man.

2462
01:06:16,481 --> 01:06:19,050
I've never seen a guy
that's that successful.

2463
01:06:19,070 --> 01:06:19,540
It's that,

2464
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:20,620
that well built,

2465
01:06:20,970 --> 01:06:21,261
you know,

2466
01:06:21,261 --> 01:06:23,830
that's not a normal frame for a,

2467
01:06:23,831 --> 01:06:24,250
um,

2468
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:25,270
an MMA fighter.

2469
01:06:25,350 --> 01:06:25,640
No,

2470
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:26,080
that's,

2471
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:26,913
that's a Bot.

2472
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:29,080
That's a body back to his Jujitsu man.

2473
01:06:29,081 --> 01:06:31,450
That guy's Jujitsu is fucking ridiculous.

2474
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:32,410
He's ridiculous.

2475
01:06:32,411 --> 01:06:32,920
Yeah.

2476
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,120
It's videos of him,

2477
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:34,620
Roland,

2478
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:35,430
with guys that,

2479
01:06:35,430 --> 01:06:36,620
even at the high level guys,

2480
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:38,620
that's what it used to
look like at one 85.

2481
01:06:39,130 --> 01:06:39,341
Yeah,

2482
01:06:39,341 --> 01:06:39,641
he's a,

2483
01:06:39,641 --> 01:06:40,360
he's a freak.

2484
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:40,511
Well,

2485
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:45,370
he's got this ability to launch himself
onto a submission that you can't stop.

2486
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:49,960
He gets a hold of your leg and it just
yanks and spins and it's like a crocodile

2487
01:06:49,961 --> 01:06:50,800
got ahold of your leg,

2488
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:51,760
you're fucked.

2489
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:52,990
He just ripped that shit apart.

2490
01:06:52,991 --> 01:06:56,170
It was scary because his
Jujitsu is very high level.

2491
01:06:56,171 --> 01:06:57,310
It's not just that he's super,

2492
01:06:57,311 --> 01:06:58,360
super physically strong.

2493
01:06:58,930 --> 01:06:59,231
He's,

2494
01:06:59,231 --> 01:07:02,320
there's a video of him rolling with
some like pretty high level guys and he

2495
01:07:02,321 --> 01:07:02,711
takes it,

2496
01:07:02,711 --> 01:07:03,850
he takes his guy down,

2497
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:05,710
drop some side control,

2498
01:07:05,711 --> 01:07:06,281
spins,

2499
01:07:06,281 --> 01:07:09,060
gets his back and chokes
him all in like miss it.

2500
01:07:09,070 --> 01:07:09,940
Very high level guy.

2501
01:07:09,941 --> 01:07:11,920
He was rolling with all in 30 seconds.

2502
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:15,870
Man Runs through the you guys thing
of inputting Nam in an arm bar.

2503
01:07:15,970 --> 01:07:16,480
Yes.

2504
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:17,020
Yeah.

2505
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:18,430
I talked to mom about
that and he was like,

2506
01:07:18,431 --> 01:07:20,080
well I was drunk as shit the night before.

2507
01:07:20,081 --> 01:07:20,651
So many Ted.

2508
01:07:20,651 --> 01:07:21,490
He's still a bad ass.

2509
01:07:21,870 --> 01:07:23,020
I'm sure mayhem was,

2510
01:07:23,050 --> 01:07:24,760
but I mean who wouldn't lie about that?

2511
01:07:25,090 --> 01:07:27,180
But [inaudible] is a beast.

2512
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:28,350
He's a beast.

2513
01:07:28,350 --> 01:07:28,990
It's a beast.

2514
01:07:28,990 --> 01:07:31,630
His leg locks are fucking
things of nightmares.

2515
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:31,991
Yeah.

2516
01:07:31,991 --> 01:07:33,550
Nate named Mark Carr when he fought him.

2517
01:07:33,610 --> 01:07:35,740
I was talking to him way before
he fought him and he said,

2518
01:07:35,741 --> 01:07:37,360
the guy's got nasty leg locks,

2519
01:07:37,361 --> 01:07:38,620
and all he did was drill,

2520
01:07:38,621 --> 01:07:39,740
how to get out of those leg locks,

2521
01:07:39,810 --> 01:07:40,150
you know?

2522
01:07:40,150 --> 01:07:40,450
Yeah.

2523
01:07:40,450 --> 01:07:41,051
And He,

2524
01:07:41,051 --> 01:07:45,070
the guy who was pointing to needs
legs as if like Nate had oil on them.

2525
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:48,040
I broke a sweat was smart.

2526
01:07:48,070 --> 01:07:48,581
That's what you do.

2527
01:07:48,581 --> 01:07:49,360
You break a sweat,

2528
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:50,260
you get really sweaty,

2529
01:07:50,261 --> 01:07:52,630
like you don't have to be
oily if you're just sweaty.

2530
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:53,321
That's good enough,

2531
01:07:53,321 --> 01:07:53,920
man.

2532
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,240
So they checked his legs and I'm like,

2533
01:07:55,241 --> 01:07:55,480
nope.

2534
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:58,270
There's one that was a really weird
thing where he pointed and then he got,

2535
01:07:58,271 --> 01:07:59,560
and then they just jumped on him.

2536
01:07:59,561 --> 01:08:01,120
And that's him getting ivend salivary.

2537
01:08:01,121 --> 01:08:02,410
That's his first fight in the UFC.

2538
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:03,880
He took Ivan salivary,

2539
01:08:03,881 --> 01:08:05,050
he's back like a ghost.

2540
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:05,800
You better,

2541
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:06,690
you better start tapping.

2542
01:08:06,730 --> 01:08:08,950
It takes their back and then
he fucking throws that on.

2543
01:08:08,950 --> 01:08:09,783
Bottom line is,

2544
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:10,310
yeah,

2545
01:08:10,310 --> 01:08:11,350
he's nasty man.

2546
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:12,050
Oh yeah.

2547
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:12,460
Yeah.

2548
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:13,870
That's a beautiful submission.

2549
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:15,620
So that's what I'm saying
about Bahar is like,

2550
01:08:15,621 --> 01:08:16,670
he's not just a,

2551
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:18,350
but then he's fighting that dude.

2552
01:08:18,351 --> 01:08:19,220
Mike Pierce,

2553
01:08:19,550 --> 01:08:21,020
you know that's happening today.

2554
01:08:21,270 --> 01:08:23,540
That's today and such on a zeal.

2555
01:08:23,810 --> 01:08:25,920
Mike Pierce is a mother fucker dude that,

2556
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:27,500
that guy's on mother fucker.

2557
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:29,180
He's got a head like a fire hydrant.

2558
01:08:29,181 --> 01:08:29,721
His heads dot.

2559
01:08:29,721 --> 01:08:33,170
Why he punches holes for
people's faces and he's tough.

2560
01:08:33,171 --> 01:08:33,801
He's shit.

2561
01:08:33,801 --> 01:08:36,290
He's a fucking a really strong wrestler.

2562
01:08:36,291 --> 01:08:37,490
Like really high level.

2563
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:39,950
He's a credit attacking wrestler.

2564
01:08:40,090 --> 01:08:40,431
It's very,

2565
01:08:40,431 --> 01:08:44,840
very aggressive wrestler and his game
up against the cage drop like drop and

2566
01:08:44,841 --> 01:08:47,210
punches in on dudes is very high level.

2567
01:08:47,450 --> 01:08:49,550
He can get guys control
them up against cage,

2568
01:08:49,551 --> 01:08:50,690
beat the shit out of them,

2569
01:08:50,691 --> 01:08:52,120
hips up in the air and
just start pounding him.

2570
01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:55,010
He beats the shit out of you and
then takes you down a few times,

2571
01:08:55,011 --> 01:08:56,180
beats the shit out of you some more,

2572
01:08:56,181 --> 01:08:57,680
but he can knock you out with one punch.

2573
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,360
He's got one punch o power.

2574
01:08:59,750 --> 01:09:00,480
He's an animal that,

2575
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:00,770
yeah,

2576
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:03,230
so if Paul [inaudible] it's all like,

2577
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:07,760
there's a lot of questions like how much
did Paul Horez lose and getting down to

2578
01:09:07,761 --> 01:09:10,040
one 70 how much does he
have left in the tank?

2579
01:09:10,430 --> 01:09:12,500
Because if you lose that much weight,

2580
01:09:12,530 --> 01:09:15,920
it's very possible that you did it wrong
or it's very possible that it wasn't

2581
01:09:15,921 --> 01:09:17,870
really an attainable goal
within the time period.

2582
01:09:18,050 --> 01:09:19,070
He tried to attain it in.

2583
01:09:19,250 --> 01:09:22,790
And so unless you get an expert like
a Mike Dolce type guy to go over your

2584
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:25,700
weight cut with you like
body fat measurements,

2585
01:09:25,701 --> 01:09:26,534
water.

2586
01:09:27,370 --> 01:09:29,300
Mike Dolce is a guy who used to fight,

2587
01:09:29,330 --> 01:09:29,650
uh,

2588
01:09:29,650 --> 01:09:34,220
and he was in the ultimate fighter and
then since then he's gone on to be like a

2589
01:09:34,221 --> 01:09:35,660
fitness consultant for fighters.

2590
01:09:35,870 --> 01:09:39,530
But he's very knowledgeable and very
knowledgeable about cutting weight like

2591
01:09:39,531 --> 01:09:39,890
his,

2592
01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:43,490
the guys who he's trained with that have
listened to them and have cut weight

2593
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:48,260
because of his methods of coming in in
vastly better condition than they did

2594
01:09:48,261 --> 01:09:49,280
when they were doing it on their own.

2595
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:50,413
He's just an expert,

2596
01:09:50,430 --> 01:09:54,290
I would knows what he knows where your
body's had knows how to give you the

2597
01:09:54,291 --> 01:09:55,101
right nutrients,

2598
01:09:55,101 --> 01:09:57,740
knows how to give you cut the things
out that are going to make your body

2599
01:09:57,890 --> 01:09:59,690
naturally lose weight.

2600
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:02,420
And what are the guidelines?

2601
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:03,853
Dolce,

2602
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:05,600
Oh,

2603
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:06,730
I've actually think I've met him.

2604
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:06,901
Well,

2605
01:10:06,901 --> 01:10:07,251
what are the,

2606
01:10:07,251 --> 01:10:07,970
what are the,

2607
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:12,970
what are the guidelines for testosterone
replacement therapy or hormone replace?

2608
01:10:13,041 --> 01:10:13,850
Very good question.

2609
01:10:13,850 --> 01:10:15,500
It varies by commissioned.

2610
01:10:15,501 --> 01:10:16,460
It varies by,

2611
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:16,880
um,

2612
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:17,630
by country.

2613
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:17,811
It's a,

2614
01:10:17,811 --> 01:10:21,200
you're going to have a certain number
of nanograms per unit of blood.

2615
01:10:21,730 --> 01:10:22,340
It all,

2616
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:23,120
we'll see.

2617
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:25,640
The problem is this is
there's a bunch of problems,

2618
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:28,970
but the problem is first and
foremost that it's very variable.

2619
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:32,330
B meaning that if you take it,

2620
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:36,050
you are levels between today and tomorrow.

2621
01:10:36,290 --> 01:10:41,290
Where they're going to be at depends
entirely on when you inject it,

2622
01:10:41,311 --> 01:10:42,144
it,

2623
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,330
it depends entirely on,

2624
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:44,751
you know,

2625
01:10:44,751 --> 01:10:47,270
what kind of stuff
you've put in your body,

2626
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:50,100
what kind of testosterone depends on
entirely on whether or not you've,

2627
01:10:50,101 --> 01:10:52,490
you've injected it or whether
you apply it to your skin.

2628
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:54,620
A lot of people just
apply it to their skin.

2629
01:10:54,740 --> 01:10:56,540
So with all those variables,

2630
01:10:56,541 --> 01:10:58,070
there's a lot of room for fuckery.

2631
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:00,550
So what you could do is you could start,

2632
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:02,570
you could start it out with,

2633
01:11:02,571 --> 01:11:03,920
I'll give you a way to cheat.

2634
01:11:04,220 --> 01:11:05,060
Started out.

2635
01:11:05,090 --> 01:11:05,431
We will,

2636
01:11:05,431 --> 01:11:07,220
you take the needle
every week and you know,

2637
01:11:07,221 --> 01:11:09,170
you're only allowed to
get x amount per week,

2638
01:11:09,380 --> 01:11:11,420
but then every time
they're going to test you,

2639
01:11:11,570 --> 01:11:13,800
they're going to give
you a certain of nowness.

2640
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:14,251
You know,

2641
01:11:14,251 --> 01:11:14,521
they,

2642
01:11:14,521 --> 01:11:14,651
they,

2643
01:11:14,651 --> 01:11:15,870
they can't just show up.

2644
01:11:15,930 --> 01:11:20,930
The only people that can just show up
or Veda Veda testing or w a da or w a da

2645
01:11:23,131 --> 01:11:23,881
or v a,

2646
01:11:23,881 --> 01:11:24,121
d,

2647
01:11:24,121 --> 01:11:24,660
a w,

2648
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:26,310
either one of those as two
different organizations.

2649
01:11:26,311 --> 01:11:27,720
And I think both of them do that,

2650
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:30,810
like random thing where they wake you
up at eight o'clock in the morning and

2651
01:11:30,811 --> 01:11:31,320
tests you.

2652
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:31,830
Wow.

2653
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:32,161
Yeah.

2654
01:11:32,161 --> 01:11:35,780
So the problem is if,

2655
01:11:35,860 --> 01:11:37,410
if you're willing to gamble,

2656
01:11:37,650 --> 01:11:41,550
the way you gamble is you shoot what
you're supposed to shoot and then you rub

2657
01:11:41,551 --> 01:11:42,660
cream on top of that.

2658
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:47,820
So you have the level that's
like really a hard to drop,

2659
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,470
which is the injectable level.

2660
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:52,830
The injectable level stays that level
for a very long time apparently.

2661
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:54,380
Like if you take it your,

2662
01:11:54,390 --> 01:11:55,223
your level,

2663
01:11:55,230 --> 01:11:56,460
it'll be in your skin.

2664
01:11:56,490 --> 01:11:59,100
You'd be in your system at a
certain level of testosterone,

2665
01:11:59,330 --> 01:12:01,410
testosterone if for,

2666
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:02,273
it's like a slide.

2667
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:03,930
Yeah.

2668
01:12:03,930 --> 01:12:05,010
For like five or six days.

2669
01:12:05,190 --> 01:12:07,020
The cream only last 24 hours.

2670
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:08,190
Oh,

2671
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:09,270
so you put the cream on,

2672
01:12:09,271 --> 01:12:10,110
your body absorbs it,

2673
01:12:10,111 --> 01:12:10,944
and that's a wrap.

2674
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:12,650
So,

2675
01:12:12,650 --> 01:12:14,400
so in other words you would put,

2676
01:12:14,670 --> 01:12:15,960
if you were injected,

2677
01:12:16,050 --> 01:12:17,610
why would the cream on top of that,

2678
01:12:17,611 --> 01:12:20,280
when that spike your testosterone to
do more hands on whether or not you're

2679
01:12:20,281 --> 01:12:21,150
going to get tested,

2680
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:21,691
if you can,

2681
01:12:21,691 --> 01:12:23,040
if you can get tested that day,

2682
01:12:23,041 --> 01:12:26,520
like say if you wake up in the morning
and you know for a fact there's no one

2683
01:12:26,521 --> 01:12:27,660
who's going to test you today,

2684
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:31,920
you could rub that cream on your body
workout and then probably the next day

2685
01:12:31,950 --> 01:12:32,641
you're back down to,

2686
01:12:32,641 --> 01:12:34,290
even when you show up at the gym,

2687
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,490
they come in and test you.

2688
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:36,473
You're okay.

2689
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:40,920
But meanwhile you have more than the
prescribed amount of testosterone cycling

2690
01:12:40,921 --> 01:12:44,310
through your system and you're
using that extra testosterone,

2691
01:12:44,311 --> 01:12:48,480
that extra human level of testosterone
as a performance enhancer because you're

2692
01:12:48,481 --> 01:12:49,950
recovering in between fights.

2693
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:52,020
Even if when you fight you,

2694
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:55,740
you are fighting and that you get your
pee after the fight at a level that's

2695
01:12:55,741 --> 01:12:56,574
acceptable.

2696
01:12:56,940 --> 01:12:58,710
What was your level throughout the camp?

2697
01:12:58,711 --> 01:12:58,980
Sure.

2698
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:01,140
That's what we need to
know and it's hard to tell.

2699
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:02,071
You can see,

2700
01:13:02,071 --> 01:13:05,850
you know you can have like random ones
is all going to be a such ancient history

2701
01:13:05,851 --> 01:13:10,851
and about 10 10 years anyway because with
gene doping and when they can pinpoint

2702
01:13:11,941 --> 01:13:15,960
and they can kind of like block certain
amount of Myostatin et cetera and things

2703
01:13:15,961 --> 01:13:16,230
in your,

2704
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:19,980
in your jeans and it's safe and it's safe.

2705
01:13:20,550 --> 01:13:24,240
Now the question becomes why is it illegal
like now it's just a question of who

2706
01:13:24,241 --> 01:13:27,720
has the best you can geneticist
who has the best doctor to compete.

2707
01:13:27,721 --> 01:13:30,630
It's really an interesting thing
what it says about competition.

2708
01:13:30,631 --> 01:13:35,631
Now as we learn more and more that that
winners have to have a certain hardware

2709
01:13:35,701 --> 01:13:37,740
and the software is training and stuff,

2710
01:13:37,741 --> 01:13:39,240
but without the hardware first,

2711
01:13:39,241 --> 01:13:39,710
without that,

2712
01:13:39,710 --> 01:13:43,560
the mainframe your fuck Jon
Jones has a Ferrari bod.

2713
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:44,100
Correct.

2714
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:48,090
There's no getting past your stupid
ass Volkswagen diesel that you have.

2715
01:13:48,091 --> 01:13:49,830
There is never going to beat it for right.

2716
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:52,620
It's like this guy in the
less the FarEye breaks down.

2717
01:13:52,650 --> 01:13:53,460
This is true.

2718
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:54,420
That is just like in,

2719
01:13:54,421 --> 01:13:55,160
in the racing,

2720
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:57,330
a guy named Stefan home who is a,

2721
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:58,193
one of the greatest,

2722
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:01,080
greatest high jumper and he's five 11.

2723
01:14:01,110 --> 01:14:01,920
Stefan home.

2724
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:02,100
Yeah.

2725
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:02,791
He's a Swedish guy.

2726
01:14:02,791 --> 01:14:03,241
Five 11.

2727
01:14:03,241 --> 01:14:04,380
He became obsessed with,

2728
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:04,770
um,

2729
01:14:04,770 --> 01:14:06,480
high jumping but only was 11.

2730
01:14:06,690 --> 01:14:07,710
Most of the hydrogens are six,

2731
01:14:07,711 --> 01:14:08,544
seven and stuff.

2732
01:14:08,550 --> 01:14:08,941
Really?

2733
01:14:08,941 --> 01:14:09,480
Yes.

2734
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:11,980
And he trained and train
and train and train and

2735
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:14,450
he became so good and I think he's one,

2736
01:14:14,590 --> 01:14:15,460
I look them up,

2737
01:14:15,461 --> 01:14:18,670
but I think you want to Olympic gold
and several world championships.

2738
01:14:18,910 --> 01:14:22,540
His Achilles tendon on
his jumping foot is,

2739
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:23,710
can withstand,

2740
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:26,260
it would take 1.8 tons to pull it apart.

2741
01:14:26,290 --> 01:14:26,711
Like it's,

2742
01:14:26,711 --> 01:14:28,120
it's literally the hardest.

2743
01:14:28,121 --> 01:14:30,650
It's three times harder
than a regular man's Dick.

2744
01:14:30,790 --> 01:14:31,623
Yes.

2745
01:14:31,930 --> 01:14:32,740
Yes.

2746
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:33,530
You can hang it.

2747
01:14:33,530 --> 01:14:34,300
Telephone.

2748
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:35,140
Just be it.

2749
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:36,003
Yes.

2750
01:14:36,070 --> 01:14:37,770
And so he's trans and he's,

2751
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:38,020
and he,

2752
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:39,640
when he jumps in a,

2753
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:39,881
yeah,

2754
01:14:39,881 --> 01:14:40,270
that's him.

2755
01:14:40,270 --> 01:14:41,140
Now when he jumps,

2756
01:14:41,141 --> 01:14:42,940
his head almost touches,

2757
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:44,320
almost touches his,

2758
01:14:44,321 --> 01:14:44,590
uh,

2759
01:14:44,590 --> 01:14:45,423
his heels.

2760
01:14:45,490 --> 01:14:46,420
That's how flexibly is.

2761
01:14:46,421 --> 01:14:46,630
Right.

2762
01:14:46,630 --> 01:14:47,351
How long has he,

2763
01:14:47,351 --> 01:14:47,730
uh,

2764
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:49,170
w w w and he does this.

2765
01:14:49,171 --> 01:14:50,004
He doesn't see you see,

2766
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:52,000
you see the city do this record.

2767
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:52,510
Uh,

2768
01:14:52,510 --> 01:14:52,860
I don't,

2769
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:53,051
uh,

2770
01:14:53,051 --> 01:14:53,371
I don't know.

2771
01:14:53,371 --> 01:14:54,990
But you see how he touches
his face like that.

2772
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:55,833
He has a ritual.

2773
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:57,520
He puts his shoes on the same way.

2774
01:14:57,550 --> 01:14:57,970
Everything,

2775
01:14:57,970 --> 01:14:58,300
right?

2776
01:14:58,300 --> 01:14:58,570
No,

2777
01:14:58,570 --> 01:14:59,403
it doesn't.

2778
01:14:59,490 --> 01:14:59,820
Yeah.

2779
01:14:59,820 --> 01:15:01,440
And he jumps high jobs.

2780
01:15:01,450 --> 01:15:01,840
Right.

2781
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:02,673
That's insane.

2782
01:15:02,830 --> 01:15:03,341
It's ridiculous.

2783
01:15:03,341 --> 01:15:08,341
Like a Cheetah now that came from years
and years of training and everything

2784
01:15:09,131 --> 01:15:10,320
else should show that again.

2785
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:11,650
And he's jumped more.

2786
01:15:11,651 --> 01:15:14,140
He's jumped more than anybody
in the history of high jumping.

2787
01:15:14,890 --> 01:15:15,940
This is insane.

2788
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:17,730
Look how he flies.

2789
01:15:17,731 --> 01:15:18,190
Yeah.

2790
01:15:18,190 --> 01:15:19,540
And you see how flexible he is.

2791
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:21,520
The thing is tall man,

2792
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:22,600
it's seven foot eight.

2793
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:23,321
Look at that.

2794
01:15:23,321 --> 01:15:24,190
That's incredible.

2795
01:15:24,191 --> 01:15:24,731
Seven feet,

2796
01:15:24,731 --> 01:15:25,710
eight inches or seven,

2797
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:26,321
nine or something.

2798
01:15:26,321 --> 01:15:26,681
He's got,

2799
01:15:26,681 --> 01:15:27,400
you know.

2800
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:28,233
Wow.

2801
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:30,700
So along comes crazy as fuck man.

2802
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:32,530
Imagine dating that guy.

2803
01:15:32,580 --> 01:15:32,920
Yeah.

2804
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:34,630
So along comes this guy from,

2805
01:15:34,631 --> 01:15:36,670
from Barbados or something is Canadian.

2806
01:15:36,810 --> 01:15:37,121
He's a,

2807
01:15:37,121 --> 01:15:39,910
he's this Barbadian guy and he's like six,

2808
01:15:39,911 --> 01:15:40,450
uh,

2809
01:15:40,450 --> 01:15:41,450
like five or whatever.

2810
01:15:41,451 --> 01:15:41,830
And,

2811
01:15:41,830 --> 01:15:43,420
and they were talking and he was saying,

2812
01:15:43,470 --> 01:15:43,870
um,

2813
01:15:43,870 --> 01:15:44,740
he was talking about,

2814
01:15:44,930 --> 01:15:46,960
they was like dunking a basketball,

2815
01:15:46,961 --> 01:15:49,690
like they've just dunking and crazy
ways and he really didn't play much

2816
01:15:49,691 --> 01:15:50,081
basketball,

2817
01:15:50,081 --> 01:15:50,890
but he was just jumping.

2818
01:15:50,890 --> 01:15:54,520
And so he starts talking to this high
jumper who says something to the effect

2819
01:15:54,521 --> 01:15:54,760
of,

2820
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:55,570
you know,

2821
01:15:55,570 --> 01:15:55,871
uh,

2822
01:15:55,871 --> 01:15:56,201
yeah,

2823
01:15:56,201 --> 01:15:57,190
but high jumping is different.

2824
01:15:57,191 --> 01:15:57,371
He goes,

2825
01:15:57,371 --> 01:15:59,920
I bet you I could jump over that thing.

2826
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:00,731
And it was six,

2827
01:16:00,731 --> 01:16:01,421
five or six,

2828
01:16:01,421 --> 01:16:02,254
seven or six.

2829
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:04,630
So be before the day's over,

2830
01:16:04,631 --> 01:16:05,590
after like four jumps,

2831
01:16:05,591 --> 01:16:06,424
he jumps,

2832
01:16:06,460 --> 01:16:08,650
he clears six,

2833
01:16:08,651 --> 01:16:09,070
eight,

2834
01:16:09,070 --> 01:16:09,661
six inch,

2835
01:16:09,661 --> 01:16:10,241
five feet,

2836
01:16:10,241 --> 01:16:11,470
eight inches with no technique.

2837
01:16:11,471 --> 01:16:12,670
Literally jumping over it.

2838
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:13,930
So,

2839
01:16:13,930 --> 01:16:14,351
uh,

2840
01:16:14,351 --> 01:16:14,681
the,

2841
01:16:14,681 --> 01:16:16,810
the cove track coach comes out and goes,

2842
01:16:16,811 --> 01:16:17,680
that's not possible.

2843
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:18,573
Now what are you talking about?

2844
01:16:18,610 --> 01:16:19,030
And he goes,

2845
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:19,540
come.

2846
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:19,990
And he goes,

2847
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:20,291
wait,

2848
01:16:20,291 --> 01:16:21,520
he's got jumping six had never done,

2849
01:16:21,530 --> 01:16:23,620
if that's not possible of
how you dramatize these,

2850
01:16:23,621 --> 01:16:25,380
like it's an ABC school special.

2851
01:16:25,390 --> 01:16:26,480
You put in the dialogue.

2852
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:28,990
Do you have a guy with a
different voice to stop Boston?

2853
01:16:28,991 --> 01:16:29,630
Both your guy,

2854
01:16:29,630 --> 01:16:29,921
you've got to,

2855
01:16:29,921 --> 01:16:31,870
you got to delineate the character's man.

2856
01:16:31,870 --> 01:16:32,530
I see what you're doing.

2857
01:16:32,530 --> 01:16:32,880
He said,

2858
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:34,180
I just not possible rockets.

2859
01:16:34,181 --> 01:16:34,840
No Way.

2860
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:35,680
That's not way.

2861
01:16:36,220 --> 01:16:37,053
And uh,

2862
01:16:37,540 --> 01:16:37,960
he,

2863
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,070
he goes out there and sure enough,

2864
01:16:39,071 --> 01:16:42,550
this guy jumps I think in eight
months of practice and this guy,

2865
01:16:42,551 --> 01:16:43,030
Stephen homes,

2866
01:16:43,030 --> 01:16:45,100
been practicing his whole life
in eight months of practice.

2867
01:16:45,670 --> 01:16:45,881
Uh,

2868
01:16:45,881 --> 01:16:47,860
and he didn't practice much
because he didn't really want to.

2869
01:16:47,861 --> 01:16:48,610
It's like whatever.

2870
01:16:48,610 --> 01:16:48,941
Uh,

2871
01:16:48,941 --> 01:16:50,050
he won the world championships.

2872
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:53,340
He jumped s eight feet already
cleared eight feet or something crazy.

2873
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:54,030
It's eight.

2874
01:16:54,030 --> 01:16:54,400
Yeah.

2875
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:55,150
Something insane.

2876
01:16:55,150 --> 01:16:55,983
Never been done.

2877
01:16:56,140 --> 01:16:56,973
Eight months.

2878
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:57,251
Uh,

2879
01:16:57,251 --> 01:16:58,210
actually plateaued.

2880
01:16:58,211 --> 01:17:00,670
Never got better because he just
didn't really want to train much,

2881
01:17:00,671 --> 01:17:01,504
but his,

2882
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:06,520
but he had an achilles tendon apparently
that was like two times longer than the

2883
01:17:06,611 --> 01:17:10,370
average person just born
with a certain symmetry.

2884
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:11,090
Wow.

2885
01:17:11,090 --> 01:17:11,301
Just,

2886
01:17:11,301 --> 01:17:11,520
you know,

2887
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:12,530
just certain mechanics.

2888
01:17:12,531 --> 01:17:12,980
Yeah.

2889
01:17:12,980 --> 01:17:14,060
And where he was able to jump.

2890
01:17:14,061 --> 01:17:15,650
And so no matter how much you trained,

2891
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:18,170
some people are going
to jump and run faster.

2892
01:17:18,171 --> 01:17:18,680
And you know,

2893
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:20,180
swim panics are gigantic.

2894
01:17:20,450 --> 01:17:21,980
One of the really gigantic,

2895
01:17:21,981 --> 01:17:23,240
once his punching power,

2896
01:17:23,860 --> 01:17:25,070
the mechanics of punching power,

2897
01:17:25,071 --> 01:17:26,690
like the natural born punching power.

2898
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:28,240
There's certain guys that,

2899
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:29,840
or are great,

2900
01:17:29,870 --> 01:17:31,040
great fighters,

2901
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:32,180
but they just,

2902
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:33,531
perfect example,

2903
01:17:33,531 --> 01:17:34,364
Wayne McCullough,

2904
01:17:34,490 --> 01:17:36,530
Wayne McCullough is a great fighter,

2905
01:17:36,830 --> 01:17:40,440
multiple time champion and a
really cool guy on top of that.

2906
01:17:40,441 --> 01:17:41,210
And he's a,

2907
01:17:41,210 --> 01:17:42,320
I met him a million times,

2908
01:17:42,321 --> 01:17:44,120
hang out in Vegas and he's a super,

2909
01:17:44,121 --> 01:17:44,954
super good guy.

2910
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:46,820
Wayne McCullough was a bad motherfucker.

2911
01:17:46,910 --> 01:17:48,140
He's calling the pocket rocket.

2912
01:17:48,590 --> 01:17:49,430
And his,

2913
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:54,520
his number one issue was that he couldn't
like knock guys out with one punch.

2914
01:17:56,010 --> 01:17:56,630
It wasn't,

2915
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:56,841
you know,

2916
01:17:56,841 --> 01:17:57,111
he was,

2917
01:17:57,111 --> 01:17:57,320
uh,

2918
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:57,860
like a,

2919
01:17:57,860 --> 01:17:59,770
a volume combination,

2920
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:00,980
very technical fighter,

2921
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:02,240
but very,

2922
01:18:02,241 --> 01:18:02,631
you know,

2923
01:18:02,631 --> 01:18:04,160
just relentless,

2924
01:18:04,161 --> 01:18:05,660
relentless boxer,

2925
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:06,021
you know,

2926
01:18:06,021 --> 01:18:07,280
just really excellent.

2927
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:11,150
Like if you wanted to learn how
to box could watch one of his,

2928
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:12,180
his bouts of Waco,

2929
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:14,010
Wayne McCullough was,

2930
01:18:14,090 --> 01:18:16,850
is a style that you could emulate
and be like incredibly successful.

2931
01:18:16,851 --> 01:18:19,370
He was a beautiful fighter and,

2932
01:18:19,371 --> 01:18:20,090
um,

2933
01:18:20,090 --> 01:18:20,481
you know,

2934
01:18:20,481 --> 01:18:21,770
that kind of a guy.

2935
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:26,480
There's no way they're going to have
that sort of Tommy Hearns power.

2936
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:31,900
Like Tommy Hearns had this insane whip
power in his right hand that you cannot

2937
01:18:33,411 --> 01:18:35,750
teach a guy and you either
have that or you don't.

2938
01:18:35,751 --> 01:18:37,730
Wayne McCullough was a brilliant,

2939
01:18:37,731 --> 01:18:38,570
brilliant fighter,

2940
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:42,380
but the difference between what he could
do with one punch and with Tommy Hearns

2941
01:18:42,381 --> 01:18:43,214
could do with one punch.

2942
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:46,160
It's like the difference between getting
hit with a pebble and getting hit with

2943
01:18:46,161 --> 01:18:47,600
a fucking nuclear weapon.

2944
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:48,913
I mean,

2945
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:49,670
getting hit.

2946
01:18:49,670 --> 01:18:51,740
A better example is
that Macola right there.

2947
01:18:52,670 --> 01:18:53,430
Is that Macola?

2948
01:18:53,430 --> 01:18:54,010
Yeah,

2949
01:18:54,010 --> 01:18:54,820
though that's waned.

2950
01:18:54,820 --> 01:18:55,910
Dominating this dude.

2951
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:59,570
He was an animal man who's an amazing
fighter that shows show some of this.

2952
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:01,400
We got such shitty resolution.

2953
01:19:02,350 --> 01:19:04,010
What's with the gross music behind that?

2954
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:07,400
Is there a soundtrack to this
thing and way McCall was an animal.

2955
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:09,200
He would just get on top of dudes.

2956
01:19:09,380 --> 01:19:11,030
These fucking Irish fighters.

2957
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:11,330
Oh,

2958
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:12,170
savages.

2959
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:13,430
Barry McGuigan.

2960
01:19:13,431 --> 01:19:15,770
He was a savage to savages.

2961
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:16,791
So tough,

2962
01:19:16,791 --> 01:19:18,770
tough fucking guys moving his head.

2963
01:19:18,771 --> 01:19:19,391
Always stands,

2964
01:19:19,391 --> 01:19:20,224
tends to happen.

2965
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:23,210
There's no breaks for you
that never stops moving.

2966
01:19:23,540 --> 01:19:24,650
No breaks for you son.

2967
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,780
Every round was him
punching you in the face.

2968
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:28,940
He would just wear on motherfuckers.

2969
01:19:28,970 --> 01:19:29,691
Tiny guy too,

2970
01:19:29,691 --> 01:19:30,090
right?

2971
01:19:30,090 --> 01:19:30,651
It wasn't.

2972
01:19:30,651 --> 01:19:31,131
He's not very,

2973
01:19:31,131 --> 01:19:31,520
you know,

2974
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:32,181
it doesn't have a very,

2975
01:19:32,181 --> 01:19:33,014
have a large frame.

2976
01:19:33,170 --> 01:19:34,003
Yeah,

2977
01:19:34,740 --> 01:19:35,211
like those,

2978
01:19:35,211 --> 01:19:35,931
those kind of guys.

2979
01:19:35,931 --> 01:19:36,111
Like,

2980
01:19:36,111 --> 01:19:37,730
he'll hit you a bunch of times,

2981
01:19:37,731 --> 01:19:39,290
but he'll just continue to hit you at,

2982
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:40,161
you know that.

2983
01:19:40,161 --> 01:19:40,371
I mean,

2984
01:19:40,371 --> 01:19:41,630
he could certainly knock me out,

2985
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:41,970
you know,

2986
01:19:41,970 --> 01:19:43,190
if you're punching in the face clean,

2987
01:19:43,460 --> 01:19:44,270
no doubt about that.

2988
01:19:44,270 --> 01:19:46,460
But what I'm saying is the difference
between what he can do and it got like

2989
01:19:46,461 --> 01:19:47,291
Mike Tyson could do it.

2990
01:19:47,291 --> 01:19:47,840
Yeah,

2991
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:51,740
you can't teach that Mike
Tyson could murder people.

2992
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:52,370
You know?

2993
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:57,050
If you go back to when Mike Tyson beat
Michael Spinks and he fucking hit him

2994
01:19:57,051 --> 01:19:58,490
with that hook to the
body and dropped him.

2995
01:19:58,830 --> 01:19:59,331
What happened?

2996
01:19:59,331 --> 01:20:00,170
He didn't know what happened.

2997
01:20:00,171 --> 01:20:03,530
Spanx got up and then he uppercutted him
through the ropes and it was just boom

2998
01:20:03,531 --> 01:20:04,100
son.

2999
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:05,180
I've never seen anybody at like,

3000
01:20:05,330 --> 01:20:06,740
it was ruthless man.

3001
01:20:06,741 --> 01:20:07,574
It was a,

3002
01:20:07,830 --> 01:20:10,200
he could just smash you with one shot.

3003
01:20:10,230 --> 01:20:11,280
Some guys can do that.

3004
01:20:11,370 --> 01:20:12,630
Some guys just can't.

3005
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:13,261
They can't,

3006
01:20:13,261 --> 01:20:14,550
they never will be able to.

3007
01:20:14,670 --> 01:20:18,780
They just do not have the ability
to knock a guy out with one shot.

3008
01:20:18,870 --> 01:20:22,290
And if you speed to his ability
to turn his body like that,

3009
01:20:22,310 --> 01:20:23,550
it's just so ridiculous.

3010
01:20:23,580 --> 01:20:25,530
The fights that I would
have loved to have seen.

3011
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:26,400
If you could get,

3012
01:20:26,401 --> 01:20:29,970
give me a machine that
allow me to watch fights,

3013
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:35,240
who throughout history and see who would
beat who I would take the Prime Mike

3014
01:20:35,670 --> 01:20:37,290
Tyson versus everyone.

3015
01:20:37,470 --> 01:20:38,340
That's what I would take.

3016
01:20:38,341 --> 01:20:40,260
I would take the Tyson package please.

3017
01:20:40,430 --> 01:20:41,760
He'd go back and see Tyson fight.

3018
01:20:41,761 --> 01:20:42,594
Jack Johnson.

3019
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:43,650
I want to see Tyson fight.

3020
01:20:43,651 --> 01:20:45,390
Jack Dempsey on cm Tyson fight.

3021
01:20:45,391 --> 01:20:46,650
Larry Holmes in his frame.

3022
01:20:46,770 --> 01:20:47,161
Frasier.

3023
01:20:47,161 --> 01:20:47,461
I didn't,

3024
01:20:47,461 --> 01:20:48,660
I think homes would have beaten him.

3025
01:20:48,940 --> 01:20:49,681
No,

3026
01:20:49,681 --> 01:20:49,921
no,

3027
01:20:49,921 --> 01:20:50,130
no.

3028
01:20:50,130 --> 01:20:52,600
Got That Jab jab he had.

3029
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:53,730
It was,

3030
01:20:53,730 --> 01:20:56,490
he was still pretty fucking good when
Mike Tyson put them to sleep after two

3031
01:20:56,491 --> 01:20:57,324
rounds.

3032
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:58,890
Larry Holmes is still pretty fucking good.

3033
01:20:58,891 --> 01:21:01,520
Back then Tyson was something
special and Larry Holmes had a,

3034
01:21:01,530 --> 01:21:02,460
it was a great,

3035
01:21:02,461 --> 01:21:02,731
great,

3036
01:21:02,731 --> 01:21:03,550
great boxer.

3037
01:21:03,550 --> 01:21:04,351
It's no doubt about it.

3038
01:21:04,351 --> 01:21:06,000
It was certainly been
much more competitive.

3039
01:21:06,210 --> 01:21:06,721
If you've got the,

3040
01:21:06,721 --> 01:21:08,460
Larry Holmes had fucked up Gerry Cooney,

3041
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:10,560
if you put that Larry
Holmes in with Mike Tyson,

3042
01:21:10,561 --> 01:21:11,700
that's a different Larry Holmes.

3043
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:12,721
By the time they fought,

3044
01:21:12,721 --> 01:21:14,010
Larry was 36 years old.

3045
01:21:14,011 --> 01:21:14,844
He started to,

3046
01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:15,300
you know,

3047
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:16,410
hit a long structure.

3048
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:16,981
Good fighter.

3049
01:21:16,981 --> 01:21:17,211
He,

3050
01:21:17,211 --> 01:21:18,780
he's in the Pantheon of great fighters.

3051
01:21:18,781 --> 01:21:20,040
Larry Holmes without question,

3052
01:21:20,190 --> 01:21:21,450
who his boxing is,

3053
01:21:21,451 --> 01:21:21,950
you know,

3054
01:21:21,950 --> 01:21:22,230
well,

3055
01:21:22,230 --> 01:21:23,510
some of the best heavyweight divisions,

3056
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:24,900
Molly's sparring partner,

3057
01:21:24,901 --> 01:21:25,081
if you,

3058
01:21:25,081 --> 01:21:26,610
if you watch that movie
when we were kings,

3059
01:21:26,910 --> 01:21:28,080
Larry Holmes is his,

3060
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:30,000
is his number one sparring
partner you ever seen?

3061
01:21:30,390 --> 01:21:30,601
Well,

3062
01:21:30,601 --> 01:21:30,811
in,

3063
01:21:30,811 --> 01:21:30,991
in,

3064
01:21:30,991 --> 01:21:31,711
in a lot of ways.

3065
01:21:31,711 --> 01:21:35,280
Larry Holmes in history doesn't get the
respect that he's due because he came

3066
01:21:35,281 --> 01:21:35,971
after Ali.

3067
01:21:35,971 --> 01:21:36,330
Yeah.

3068
01:21:36,330 --> 01:21:39,360
And he was the guy who beat
up Ali when he beat up,

3069
01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:39,751
I'll leave.

3070
01:21:39,751 --> 01:21:41,940
People never forgave him
for that and he didn't.

3071
01:21:41,990 --> 01:21:42,270
Meanwhile,

3072
01:21:42,270 --> 01:21:43,410
he knew all these so well they had been,

3073
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:43,680
they,

3074
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:45,470
they'd been sparring partners and yeah,

3075
01:21:45,590 --> 01:21:46,350
and those,

3076
01:21:46,350 --> 01:21:48,240
those last days of Ali,

3077
01:21:48,450 --> 01:21:52,140
those should be the last days of Ali's
career should be followed by every boxer

3078
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:53,940
very close with a fine tooth comb.

3079
01:21:54,060 --> 01:21:55,980
So this is Larry when he had already,

3080
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:57,481
but you know what?

3081
01:21:57,481 --> 01:21:58,410
Here's another thing.

3082
01:21:58,620 --> 01:21:59,760
Here's the real deal.

3083
01:21:59,790 --> 01:22:03,360
Larry did not face the kind of
opposition that Mike Tyson did.

3084
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:04,313
He just didn't,

3085
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:05,513
he just didn't,

3086
01:22:05,660 --> 01:22:05,911
you know,

3087
01:22:05,911 --> 01:22:10,911
Larry fought a lot of good guys but his
division was particularly weak and when

3088
01:22:10,981 --> 01:22:12,710
Tyson came along it was like pink land,

3089
01:22:12,711 --> 01:22:13,201
Thomas,

3090
01:22:13,201 --> 01:22:14,040
Tony Tubs,

3091
01:22:14,250 --> 01:22:16,120
all these guys that they were just,

3092
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:20,090
they were very good fighters but they
just weren't like this motherfucker.

3093
01:22:20,170 --> 01:22:20,570
Look at how,

3094
01:22:20,570 --> 01:22:21,870
look at how fast Tyson was.

3095
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:25,710
He was scared and his ship
work was amazing to look at
us and he just had to hit

3096
01:22:25,711 --> 01:22:28,740
you once and he was so good at
that bobbing and weaving style.

3097
01:22:28,830 --> 01:22:33,820
He got a lazier as he got further away
from the custom auto training from

3098
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:34,740
testimony I,

3099
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:38,280
they said that was the beginning of the
end for him also left Rooney when he

3100
01:22:38,281 --> 01:22:39,420
rapped left Rooney,

3101
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:40,171
you know,

3102
01:22:40,171 --> 01:22:42,080
those guys had a falling
out and then we'll,

3103
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:46,470
that Pico was down from chat style and
he also got away from someone who's not

3104
01:22:46,471 --> 01:22:47,304
bullshitting him.

3105
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:48,480
And that's what happened.

3106
01:22:48,481 --> 01:22:52,470
And that's where he went from being the
greatest in the world to like slowly but

3107
01:22:52,471 --> 01:22:54,270
surely getting beaten by guys.

3108
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:55,950
And then the buster Douglas fight,

3109
01:22:55,951 --> 01:22:57,210
which is like the perfect storm.

3110
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:59,520
Douglas comes in and Douglass,

3111
01:22:59,550 --> 01:23:04,550
his mother just died and he did not
give a fuck and he wasn't scared at all.

3112
01:23:04,771 --> 01:23:05,740
He lost his mother,

3113
01:23:05,770 --> 01:23:07,790
so she just came in and boxed it.

3114
01:23:08,620 --> 01:23:09,311
Huge man,

3115
01:23:09,311 --> 01:23:10,140
by the way,

3116
01:23:10,140 --> 01:23:12,420
like I was watching him
Jad Tyson and Tyson,

3117
01:23:12,421 --> 01:23:13,780
his head go back like that.

3118
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:18,840
You see Tyson's head
snap back as as busted,

3119
01:23:18,930 --> 01:23:19,560
busted.

3120
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:21,820
It's just throwing those amazing jabs.

3121
01:23:21,821 --> 01:23:26,821
Who Buster Douglas in that like when
he went in that fight put on one of the

3122
01:23:27,101 --> 01:23:28,960
greatest performances in boxing history.

3123
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:29,913
It was brilliant.

3124
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:32,740
It wasn't just brilliant because
he was fighting Mike Tyson.

3125
01:23:32,890 --> 01:23:33,521
It was brilliant,

3126
01:23:33,521 --> 01:23:34,150
period.

3127
01:23:34,150 --> 01:23:35,230
It was a tremendous fight.

3128
01:23:35,231 --> 01:23:37,210
He finally fought up to his potential.

3129
01:23:37,270 --> 01:23:39,070
Buster Douglas was always a talented guy.

3130
01:23:39,071 --> 01:23:40,870
That was a little kind of a little lazy,

3131
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:42,520
but not in this fight and this fight.

3132
01:23:42,521 --> 01:23:44,620
He fought like a fucking king.

3133
01:23:45,010 --> 01:23:50,000
He hooked off the jab better than anybody
I've ever seen heavyweight divisions

3134
01:23:50,050 --> 01:23:52,180
to the way he hooked off the jab though,

3135
01:23:52,181 --> 01:23:52,511
Dude.

3136
01:23:52,511 --> 01:23:54,730
I mean it was like really like Ali ask.

3137
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:55,390
Yeah,

3138
01:23:55,390 --> 01:23:56,650
I mean it was beautiful.

3139
01:23:56,710 --> 01:24:01,710
He was firing the Jab and hooking off
it and the fucking power bomb left hook

3140
01:24:01,811 --> 01:24:02,710
that starts this off.

3141
01:24:02,770 --> 01:24:03,603
Watch this shit.

3142
01:24:03,610 --> 01:24:04,570
Look at this jabbing,

3143
01:24:04,780 --> 01:24:05,650
just tagging them.

3144
01:24:05,651 --> 01:24:06,280
Tagging.

3145
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:08,350
Scanning is fixed that look at that left.

3146
01:24:08,380 --> 01:24:09,850
Oh,

3147
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:14,410
he catches him with that right upper
cut first and then that power left.

3148
01:24:15,070 --> 01:24:20,070
I mean that is a fucking beautiful
combination man and heavyweight boxing.

3149
01:24:21,730 --> 01:24:25,960
There've been very few combinations
that were that gorgeous to watch on the

3150
01:24:25,961 --> 01:24:26,794
watch that again,

3151
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,080
put that lievable.

3152
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:30,790
Just the way he fires in the jabs,

3153
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,580
he's firing jabs in on Tyson's face,

3154
01:24:33,670 --> 01:24:36,140
sets him up for the uppercut lays.

3155
01:24:36,170 --> 01:24:39,220
A trap for him was fires
in these jabs on them,

3156
01:24:39,430 --> 01:24:42,160
lays the trap for them and then
sends the upper cut up the middle.

3157
01:24:42,161 --> 01:24:44,950
What's his top when he
finally fires this off?

3158
01:24:44,951 --> 01:24:45,784
Man,

3159
01:24:46,270 --> 01:24:46,660
that's,

3160
01:24:46,660 --> 01:24:48,450
that's like it's,

3161
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:50,080
it's one of the great performances,

3162
01:24:50,081 --> 01:24:50,440
man.

3163
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:50,621
Look,

3164
01:24:50,621 --> 01:24:50,891
Jab,

3165
01:24:50,891 --> 01:24:51,131
Jab,

3166
01:24:51,131 --> 01:24:51,460
Jab,

3167
01:24:51,460 --> 01:24:51,701
Jab,

3168
01:24:51,701 --> 01:24:52,001
Jab,

3169
01:24:52,001 --> 01:24:52,271
Jab,

3170
01:24:52,271 --> 01:24:52,520
Jab,

3171
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:53,353
boom.

3172
01:24:53,710 --> 01:24:54,161
Oh,

3173
01:24:54,161 --> 01:24:56,650
I mean there's a hook trap for him.

3174
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:57,220
God,

3175
01:24:57,220 --> 01:24:59,140
he set a trap for him with that upper cut.

3176
01:24:59,160 --> 01:24:59,993
Yup.

3177
01:25:00,670 --> 01:25:04,360
That was a beautiful combination
and that's just an example of a guy.

3178
01:25:04,570 --> 01:25:04,811
I mean,

3179
01:25:04,811 --> 01:25:06,910
he might not have been
able to maintain that.

3180
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:10,920
He might not have maintained it after
he made so much money off of it.

3181
01:25:10,930 --> 01:25:12,640
This fight and after the Holyfield fight,

3182
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:14,970
they had lost at the moment and
yet at the moment of greatness,

3183
01:25:15,020 --> 01:25:17,350
I mean he made a tremendous
amount of money and maybe he just,

3184
01:25:17,410 --> 01:25:18,460
after his mom died,

3185
01:25:18,461 --> 01:25:19,570
he didn't want to do it anymore.

3186
01:25:19,570 --> 01:25:23,020
Maybe the Tyson fight was just such
a high water mark that he was done,

3187
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:27,460
but no one can take this away from
buster Douglas that this night.

3188
01:25:27,850 --> 01:25:30,340
It wasn't just that he was
fighting and undertrained Tyson.

3189
01:25:30,570 --> 01:25:33,700
It wasn't just that he was fighting
a guy who underestimated him.

3190
01:25:33,850 --> 01:25:37,120
It was that he came to give zero fucks.

3191
01:25:37,390 --> 01:25:41,200
He came to give zero fucks and show what
he's capable of and he trained like a

3192
01:25:41,201 --> 01:25:42,580
motherfucker for this fight.

3193
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:45,760
He came in in incredible
shape throwing bombs here.

3194
01:25:45,761 --> 01:25:48,610
I think it was in the 10th with
these stop them in the 10th round.

3195
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:51,580
A lot of guys that came in against
Tyson that we're already a beat too.

3196
01:25:51,581 --> 01:25:51,821
I mean,

3197
01:25:51,821 --> 01:25:52,301
a lot of ways.

3198
01:25:52,301 --> 01:25:54,160
They were just so afraid
of his punching power.

3199
01:25:54,460 --> 01:25:57,280
I believe it was the 10th I believe
it was late in the fight and was also,

3200
01:25:57,281 --> 01:25:57,821
by the way,

3201
01:25:57,821 --> 01:25:59,980
after buster Douglas
had been knocked down.

3202
01:26:00,010 --> 01:26:00,131
Yeah,

3203
01:26:00,131 --> 01:26:02,410
it was the 10th I remember
I was so knocked down,

3204
01:26:02,470 --> 01:26:03,980
I think in the eighth of the night.

3205
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:04,670
I didn't know that.

3206
01:26:04,670 --> 01:26:04,791
Yeah,

3207
01:26:04,791 --> 01:26:07,490
you got dropped twice and clipped him
with an upper cut and had him hurt.

3208
01:26:07,940 --> 01:26:08,181
Look,

3209
01:26:08,181 --> 01:26:08,540
man,

3210
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:12,560
that was a fucking master full
performance and it wasn't the right Tyson.

3211
01:26:12,830 --> 01:26:13,041
I mean,

3212
01:26:13,041 --> 01:26:16,160
I would've loved to see that buster
Douglas again said Tyson had fought Marvis

3213
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:16,430
Davis,

3214
01:26:16,430 --> 01:26:17,160
marvelous phrase.

3215
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:19,310
She said that he wasn't training
as much as he should have then,

3216
01:26:19,311 --> 01:26:22,100
and that was when he was starting
to get called the scariest all time.

3217
01:26:22,101 --> 01:26:24,530
Tyson was the Tyson that was
still trying to prove himself.

3218
01:26:24,890 --> 01:26:27,290
If you look for Tyson
versus Marvis Frasier,

3219
01:26:27,530 --> 01:26:28,730
that's the mother fucker.

3220
01:26:28,731 --> 01:26:29,780
That's the man.

3221
01:26:29,990 --> 01:26:30,860
That's the boogeyman.

3222
01:26:30,910 --> 01:26:31,150
Yeah.

3223
01:26:31,150 --> 01:26:32,770
Because you watch Tyson and you've for,

3224
01:26:32,870 --> 01:26:36,620
you see Marvins Frazier across the ring
from him and you see Tyson warming up

3225
01:26:36,621 --> 01:26:36,950
and you're like,

3226
01:26:36,950 --> 01:26:38,570
I'm about to witness an execution.

3227
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:41,090
And you see Joe Frazier
trying to pump it sun up,

3228
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:42,350
tell us on the box,

3229
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:46,850
and that guy walks in there and he can
barely breathe because he knows what's

3230
01:26:46,851 --> 01:26:47,351
going to happen.

3231
01:26:47,351 --> 01:26:47,451
I mean,

3232
01:26:47,451 --> 01:26:48,201
he's so nervous.

3233
01:26:48,201 --> 01:26:50,510
He's in the ring with the peak Tyson,

3234
01:26:50,690 --> 01:26:51,770
the peak ferocity,

3235
01:26:51,771 --> 01:26:55,550
because the peak really wasn't even
after he had become the champion.

3236
01:26:55,820 --> 01:26:57,410
The peak was on its way up.

3237
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:58,273
Aw,

3238
01:26:58,310 --> 01:26:58,760
look at him.

3239
01:26:58,760 --> 01:26:59,593
Look at him.

3240
01:27:00,140 --> 01:27:00,990
They're going to build on him.

3241
01:27:00,991 --> 01:27:02,000
It's ridiculous.

3242
01:27:02,270 --> 01:27:05,450
I want to know how you think he'd do
an MMA against guys like John Jones.

3243
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:07,190
This was before he fought for the title.

3244
01:27:07,191 --> 01:27:07,401
I'm,

3245
01:27:07,401 --> 01:27:07,531
I'm,

3246
01:27:07,531 --> 01:27:08,390
I'm pretty sure,

3247
01:27:08,391 --> 01:27:08,871
let me,

3248
01:27:08,871 --> 01:27:09,080
uh,

3249
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:09,500
let me,

3250
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:10,333
absolutely,

3251
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:14,600
I believe it was when he was on his
way up and everybody was shitting their

3252
01:27:14,601 --> 01:27:17,480
pants because he was on like ABC.

3253
01:27:17,510 --> 01:27:18,590
I think this was,

3254
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:19,461
look at Joe Frazier.

3255
01:27:19,461 --> 01:27:19,820
Look at it.

3256
01:27:19,820 --> 01:27:20,750
If they're like twins,

3257
01:27:21,050 --> 01:27:21,831
they're like twins,

3258
01:27:21,831 --> 01:27:22,071
man.

3259
01:27:22,071 --> 01:27:22,904
He and his dad.

3260
01:27:23,570 --> 01:27:25,220
Joe Frazier was a great fighter.

3261
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:27,200
Look at his dad and his
dad right behind him.

3262
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:27,951
Yeah,

3263
01:27:27,951 --> 01:27:28,671
it looks just like them,

3264
01:27:28,671 --> 01:27:30,950
but Marvis was like more slight in frame.

3265
01:27:31,180 --> 01:27:32,030
It's not that slight.

3266
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:33,440
Well more slight than him.

3267
01:27:33,441 --> 01:27:34,700
Not like compared to you.

3268
01:27:34,701 --> 01:27:35,534
It's true.

3269
01:27:35,630 --> 01:27:36,110
Look at that.

3270
01:27:36,110 --> 01:27:36,711
Look at Tyson.

3271
01:27:36,711 --> 01:27:39,710
Tyson has just built to
administer an ass kicking.

3272
01:27:40,430 --> 01:27:40,970
Look at that.

3273
01:27:40,970 --> 01:27:41,211
Look at,

3274
01:27:41,211 --> 01:27:41,631
he's like,

3275
01:27:41,631 --> 01:27:42,080
he's like,

3276
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,100
it's like a joke.

3277
01:27:43,101 --> 01:27:44,330
He's like a cartoon character.

3278
01:27:44,510 --> 01:27:47,930
He actually fought twice after
that before you won the title.

3279
01:27:48,020 --> 01:27:50,420
So you're dealing with a guy
who was 20 years old here.

3280
01:27:51,110 --> 01:27:51,930
This is a,

3281
01:27:51,930 --> 01:27:52,461
this is up.

3282
01:27:52,461 --> 01:27:53,330
Jumped the boogeyman.

3283
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:56,960
I didn't have the look on
[inaudible] face was Fraser box.

3284
01:27:56,961 --> 01:27:57,794
Not Long.

3285
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:58,040
No.

3286
01:27:58,040 --> 01:27:59,150
I think this was it for him.

3287
01:27:59,151 --> 01:28:02,240
He might've fought one or two
times two wealthy or something.

3288
01:28:02,460 --> 01:28:02,601
Well,

3289
01:28:02,601 --> 01:28:03,950
this is a terrible beating.

3290
01:28:04,190 --> 01:28:06,590
This is my growing up too wealthy.

3291
01:28:06,620 --> 01:28:07,430
Maybe,

3292
01:28:07,430 --> 01:28:07,910
you know,

3293
01:28:07,910 --> 01:28:08,690
whatever.

3294
01:28:08,690 --> 01:28:10,190
There's no way he was
going to be this guy.

3295
01:28:10,550 --> 01:28:12,200
This is a look at this.

3296
01:28:12,201 --> 01:28:14,990
This was two completely different
types of human beings here.

3297
01:28:15,170 --> 01:28:16,003
Look at this fight,

3298
01:28:16,070 --> 01:28:17,540
and this is an assault.

3299
01:28:18,050 --> 01:28:19,430
This is not a boxing match.

3300
01:28:19,431 --> 01:28:22,400
This is a boxing match between the son
of one of the greatest fighters of all

3301
01:28:22,401 --> 01:28:24,300
time and a murder,

3302
01:28:24,301 --> 01:28:24,631
whatever,

3303
01:28:24,631 --> 01:28:25,310
up to a scene.

3304
01:28:25,310 --> 01:28:27,020
Frasier and his private fight him.

3305
01:28:27,050 --> 01:28:27,170
Yeah,

3306
01:28:27,170 --> 01:28:31,070
but could you imagine the horror of being
a guy like Frasier and seeing your son

3307
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:32,270
just get destroyed?

3308
01:28:32,330 --> 01:28:35,600
Look at the movement of Tyson as he
sets himself up for those punches.

3309
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:36,553
That's another thing.

3310
01:28:36,620 --> 01:28:37,191
Take a look at that.

3311
01:28:37,191 --> 01:28:37,670
Again,

3312
01:28:37,670 --> 01:28:41,780
back got up just the last combination
when he cracks him just to watch the feet

3313
01:28:41,781 --> 01:28:43,760
of Tyson as he's throwing these shots,

3314
01:28:43,910 --> 01:28:46,880
he's adjusting constantly as
he's throwing these bombs,

3315
01:28:46,881 --> 01:28:47,420
look at this,

3316
01:28:47,420 --> 01:28:47,750
look at this.

3317
01:28:47,750 --> 01:28:48,260
Boom.

3318
01:28:48,260 --> 01:28:48,890
Watch this.

3319
01:28:48,890 --> 01:28:49,760
Move backwards,

3320
01:28:49,761 --> 01:28:50,181
backwards,

3321
01:28:50,181 --> 01:28:50,601
backwards,

3322
01:28:50,601 --> 01:28:50,961
boom,

3323
01:28:50,961 --> 01:28:51,380
boom.

3324
01:28:51,380 --> 01:28:55,730
Cause he's little subtle movements to
get her stuff into perfect position.

3325
01:28:55,731 --> 01:28:59,390
That was part of the genius at Tyson
that a lot of people don't notice when a

3326
01:28:59,391 --> 01:29:01,250
lot of people watch guys punch,

3327
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:03,070
they assume that he's just
standing there punching the guy.

3328
01:29:03,270 --> 01:29:04,200
No chance,

3329
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:04,471
no.

3330
01:29:04,471 --> 01:29:05,880
He's constantly moving.

3331
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:09,360
He's just always in the absolute
perfect position to punch.

3332
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:11,640
So as he's unloading these combinations,

3333
01:29:11,850 --> 01:29:14,070
he's moving back slightly back in.

3334
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:18,600
There's a genius and a
brilliance to Tyson's destruction
of Marvis Frazier and a

3335
01:29:18,601 --> 01:29:22,710
lot of other people that a lot of other
fighters that people don't respect or

3336
01:29:22,711 --> 01:29:26,670
understand because they don't know how
difficult it is to just just a punch.

3337
01:29:26,671 --> 01:29:30,480
A guy standing in front of you this
many times and the way Tyson is doing it

3338
01:29:30,481 --> 01:29:31,980
with movement is ridiculous.

3339
01:29:31,981 --> 01:29:32,540
Look at this.

3340
01:29:32,540 --> 01:29:33,660
Boom,

3341
01:29:33,661 --> 01:29:33,930
boom.

3342
01:29:33,930 --> 01:29:34,950
Now Watch his feet,

3343
01:29:34,951 --> 01:29:35,430
man.

3344
01:29:35,430 --> 01:29:40,430
Watch he slides back and then perfect
position paying perfect position and then

3345
01:29:40,791 --> 01:29:41,611
he looks at my offices.

3346
01:29:41,611 --> 01:29:42,870
Heads swings again,

3347
01:29:42,930 --> 01:29:43,710
sets them up,

3348
01:29:43,710 --> 01:29:45,240
Bang right hand.

3349
01:29:45,660 --> 01:29:48,570
It's almost the left is measuring
the right being left hand.

3350
01:29:48,571 --> 01:29:50,190
Everything is perfect.

3351
01:29:50,420 --> 01:29:54,840
The the accuracy of both the
hands and the feet is stunning.

3352
01:29:54,841 --> 01:29:57,210
It's a masterful there.

3353
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:57,570
Dot.

3354
01:29:57,570 --> 01:29:57,850
United.

3355
01:29:57,850 --> 01:29:58,770
Just excellent.

3356
01:29:58,771 --> 01:29:59,700
He was very technical.

3357
01:29:59,701 --> 01:30:00,850
He's an excellent technical bug.

3358
01:30:00,860 --> 01:30:01,360
That's what they said,

3359
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:05,220
how hard he worked at at footwork and
there was a perfect execution or he was a

3360
01:30:05,221 --> 01:30:06,021
perfect issue.

3361
01:30:06,021 --> 01:30:07,470
Schnur is perfect.

3362
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:09,240
It looks more muscular there then.

3363
01:30:09,241 --> 01:30:12,390
Then anytime in his career
that's up jumped the boogie man,

3364
01:30:12,391 --> 01:30:13,224
Mike Tyson.

3365
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:15,840
That's when Mike Tyson was the
scariest motherfucker ever,

3366
01:30:15,990 --> 01:30:18,590
ever forget about Sonny Liston.

3367
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:19,860
Forget about Jack Dempsey.

3368
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:21,150
Forget about Jack Johnson.

3369
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:22,133
They were all great,

3370
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:26,400
but that Mike Tyson was the
scariest motherfucker of all time.

3371
01:30:27,690 --> 01:30:28,620
That was the boogeyman.

3372
01:30:29,850 --> 01:30:30,600
I never saw that.

3373
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:31,540
I actually never saw it.

3374
01:30:32,270 --> 01:30:33,420
He almost died.

3375
01:30:34,380 --> 01:30:35,600
He was a destroyer man.

3376
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:38,210
Tomorrow you would you agree
with them at this point?

3377
01:30:38,450 --> 01:30:39,051
Most definitely.

3378
01:30:39,051 --> 01:30:39,680
Anytime.

3379
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:41,230
If my manager and my train and filled out,

3380
01:30:41,231 --> 01:30:44,090
I'm confident and they're willing to put
me in a title and I show I could beat

3381
01:30:44,091 --> 01:30:44,511
the champion.

3382
01:30:44,511 --> 01:30:45,690
I'm sure I could beat him off though.

3383
01:30:45,790 --> 01:30:46,880
Of the three champions,

3384
01:30:46,881 --> 01:30:47,780
who would you like to fight?

3385
01:30:48,290 --> 01:30:50,380
Anybody my trainer put me in
with because I'm coughing now.

3386
01:30:50,390 --> 01:30:51,650
Could be any fight in the world.

3387
01:30:51,710 --> 01:30:53,120
What do you think of the three champions?

3388
01:30:53,180 --> 01:30:55,400
Don't have good fight it because
there have to be a good fight.

3389
01:30:55,401 --> 01:30:57,260
He can't take nothing away
from it to become the champion,

3390
01:30:57,530 --> 01:31:00,970
but I'm confident I'm ready and I'm
ready with my trainer tells me what am I

3391
01:31:00,971 --> 01:31:01,090
going?

3392
01:31:01,090 --> 01:31:01,970
Let's take a look at the green.

3393
01:31:02,260 --> 01:31:02,951
In my opinion,

3394
01:31:02,951 --> 01:31:03,221
this guy,

3395
01:31:03,221 --> 01:31:05,530
that guy does not get all
the respect that he deserves.

3396
01:31:05,531 --> 01:31:07,660
I think he's the greatest
boxer of all time.

3397
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:10,300
I think in that time period,

3398
01:31:10,510 --> 01:31:14,350
I think Mike Tyson is the greatest
boxer of all time because he's not just,

3399
01:31:14,410 --> 01:31:16,600
he's not just a great destroyer.

3400
01:31:16,750 --> 01:31:20,020
If you're watching how he's landing these
combinations and how he can force his

3401
01:31:20,021 --> 01:31:20,950
will on fighters.

3402
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:22,031
In my opinion,

3403
01:31:22,031 --> 01:31:25,930
he's the most devastating boxer
period that's ever existed,

3404
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:26,441
but it just,

3405
01:31:26,441 --> 01:31:28,870
he couldn't continue it for a long time.

3406
01:31:28,890 --> 01:31:29,230
Right.

3407
01:31:29,230 --> 01:31:32,590
You gotta like put it in perspective
of what he was capable of doing just

3408
01:31:32,591 --> 01:31:34,870
because he was only capable
of doing it for a few years.

3409
01:31:34,990 --> 01:31:39,690
It doesn't mean he didn't do it like
people try to judge people all overall on

3410
01:31:39,691 --> 01:31:40,840
their overall career.

3411
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:44,740
I don't because I as a person who's
had some competition in my life,

3412
01:31:44,741 --> 01:31:49,210
I know how difficult it is to maintain
even the mediocre level of performances

3413
01:31:49,211 --> 01:31:52,510
that I achieved and I know that to
be a world champion like Mike Tyson,

3414
01:31:52,570 --> 01:31:54,090
the training alone is sole nominee.

3415
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:56,080
It requires madness wires.

3416
01:31:56,081 --> 01:31:56,381
Matt,

3417
01:31:56,381 --> 01:31:57,280
what do you think of that?

3418
01:31:57,281 --> 01:31:59,830
Tyson with someone like crushes everybody.

3419
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:00,641
What about well,

3420
01:32:00,641 --> 01:32:01,750
right today a um,

3421
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:02,633
what's

3422
01:32:03,970 --> 01:32:04,720
crushes him?

3423
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:05,740
You think so rush,

3424
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:08,950
crush the Mike Tyson of up
up jumped the boogie man.

3425
01:32:08,951 --> 01:32:12,640
Mike Tyson runs through Klitschko
like a wolf through a pack.

3426
01:32:12,641 --> 01:32:13,660
A sheep really?

3427
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:15,160
I think he crushes all of them.

3428
01:32:15,310 --> 01:32:15,950
Even lending flu.

3429
01:32:15,950 --> 01:32:19,120
I just think there was a time period
where he could not be beat Max Lewis as

3430
01:32:19,121 --> 01:32:19,450
well.

3431
01:32:19,450 --> 01:32:20,500
For one I've seen,

3432
01:32:20,530 --> 01:32:24,190
I've never seen anybody go through
people like he went through Frank Bruno,

3433
01:32:24,340 --> 01:32:26,800
like he went through last and
razor Reddick was a giant.

3434
01:32:26,801 --> 01:32:27,970
Never put razor radical away.

3435
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:28,271
No,

3436
01:32:28,271 --> 01:32:30,840
but he knocked them across the
literally knock them across.

3437
01:32:31,270 --> 01:32:32,230
You know who put him away?

3438
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:33,333
Tommy Morrison.

3439
01:32:33,700 --> 01:32:34,390
Toni Morrison,

3440
01:32:34,390 --> 01:32:35,180
Tommy Mars last.

3441
01:32:35,180 --> 01:32:35,860
Hillary Odom.

3442
01:32:35,860 --> 01:32:36,693
He left hooked them.

3443
01:32:36,980 --> 01:32:37,850
Questionable Stockbridge.

3444
01:32:37,860 --> 01:32:38,531
A bit of a question.

3445
01:32:38,531 --> 01:32:38,930
We'll stop it.

3446
01:32:38,930 --> 01:32:39,430
Yeah.

3447
01:32:39,430 --> 01:32:41,740
He unloaded a combination that
I didn't think he could have.

3448
01:32:41,741 --> 01:32:42,850
Let it go on a little bit.

3449
01:32:42,851 --> 01:32:44,970
I think maybe they want to
tell you to win a little bit.

3450
01:32:44,990 --> 01:32:45,700
Little bit.

3451
01:32:45,700 --> 01:32:46,031
Ben,

3452
01:32:46,031 --> 01:32:47,290
he's the guy looked okay.

3453
01:32:47,291 --> 01:32:48,190
He looked okay to me.

3454
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:51,100
I've seen latest stoppages
is all I'm saying.

3455
01:32:51,101 --> 01:32:53,340
So all I'm saying fix could have been in,

3456
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:54,610
I think Mike Tyson,

3457
01:32:54,611 --> 01:32:55,300
if you put them in,

3458
01:32:55,300 --> 01:32:59,410
like if you had a time machine and you
could get all the money from 1926 or

3459
01:32:59,411 --> 01:33:02,590
whatever the Fuck Jack Dempsey was the
champ and put them in with Mike Tyson.

3460
01:33:02,591 --> 01:33:06,460
Just bring bikes like Mike
Tyson would run through him.

3461
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:07,450
I don't know enough about,

3462
01:33:07,451 --> 01:33:07,961
I would never been,

3463
01:33:07,961 --> 01:33:08,381
Kate said,

3464
01:33:08,381 --> 01:33:11,580
I've never seen anybody from with
my eyes hit harder than Mike Tyson.

3465
01:33:11,590 --> 01:33:12,760
It's not just hitting,

3466
01:33:12,820 --> 01:33:16,160
well I think guys probably hit
harder like Earnie shavers.

3467
01:33:17,660 --> 01:33:19,150
Earnie Shavers was a far,

3468
01:33:19,420 --> 01:33:20,470
is built different,

3469
01:33:20,471 --> 01:33:24,100
couldn't move as fast and it wasn't just
the fact that Tyson could hit you so

3470
01:33:24,101 --> 01:33:28,210
hard and we see he was so accurate and
that's what people don't understand.

3471
01:33:28,210 --> 01:33:30,130
There's a brilliance to his movement.

3472
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:31,900
It's not just punching power.

3473
01:33:32,020 --> 01:33:35,740
There's been guys that have ridiculous
punching power or any shavers is one.

3474
01:33:35,950 --> 01:33:36,131
Oh,

3475
01:33:36,131 --> 01:33:38,560
people always bring up
Tommy Hearns is another one.

3476
01:33:38,561 --> 01:33:40,780
Ridiculous punching power
in the heavyweight division.

3477
01:33:40,781 --> 01:33:41,770
There's quite a few guys.

3478
01:33:41,771 --> 01:33:42,431
George Foreman,

3479
01:33:42,431 --> 01:33:43,264
of course.

3480
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:43,691
Great.

3481
01:33:43,691 --> 01:33:45,520
One of the greatest punching
power guys of all time.

3482
01:33:45,790 --> 01:33:47,070
It's not just punching power.

3483
01:33:47,090 --> 01:33:50,650
Tyson says the brilliance
of his movement mechanics,

3484
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:55,060
an accuracy of that combination
that's just spectacular.

3485
01:33:55,061 --> 01:33:56,620
It's amazing to watch.

3486
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:58,330
It's real artwork too.

3487
01:33:58,331 --> 01:34:01,660
For a guy who knows how difficult it
is to land shots like that on a moving

3488
01:34:01,661 --> 01:34:02,350
opponent.

3489
01:34:02,350 --> 01:34:04,240
Having seen so many
different fights in my life,

3490
01:34:04,250 --> 01:34:07,330
I never seen a striker that
could fuck with Prime Mike Tyson.

3491
01:34:07,510 --> 01:34:12,010
I think it was the perfect combination
of emotions and this massive desire to be

3492
01:34:12,011 --> 01:34:15,130
loved and needed and perfect athleticism,

3493
01:34:15,340 --> 01:34:20,340
ridiculous genetics and genetics will
willpower and the perfect trainer in the

3494
01:34:21,491 --> 01:34:22,840
perfect moment of his life,

3495
01:34:22,841 --> 01:34:24,070
like a movie man,

3496
01:34:24,310 --> 01:34:26,860
custom model was a boxing genius.

3497
01:34:26,860 --> 01:34:31,030
A guy would been around the sport his
whole life and he saw this kid and he was

3498
01:34:31,031 --> 01:34:31,241
like,

3499
01:34:31,241 --> 01:34:33,070
Holy Shit,

3500
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:34,930
I'm going to take this kid in.

3501
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:38,110
Like he hasn't had anybody like
that for a long period of time.

3502
01:34:38,290 --> 01:34:39,090
From um,

3503
01:34:39,090 --> 01:34:39,201
the,

3504
01:34:39,201 --> 01:34:39,350
the,

3505
01:34:39,350 --> 01:34:41,590
the dude that about Floyd Patterson,

3506
01:34:41,591 --> 01:34:44,140
he had Floyd Patterson back
in the day and then he had,

3507
01:34:44,141 --> 01:34:44,680
um,

3508
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:44,951
the,

3509
01:34:44,951 --> 01:34:45,070
uh,

3510
01:34:45,070 --> 01:34:46,080
light heavyweight champion.

3511
01:34:46,260 --> 01:34:47,093
I'll leave for a while.

3512
01:34:47,260 --> 01:34:47,560
No,

3513
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:47,750
no,

3514
01:34:47,750 --> 01:34:47,851
no,

3515
01:34:47,851 --> 01:34:47,961
no,

3516
01:34:47,961 --> 01:34:48,131
no,

3517
01:34:48,131 --> 01:34:48,240
no,

3518
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:48,670
no,

3519
01:34:48,670 --> 01:34:48,791
no,

3520
01:34:48,791 --> 01:34:49,061
that's not,

3521
01:34:49,061 --> 01:34:49,241
yeah,

3522
01:34:49,241 --> 01:34:49,621
just done.

3523
01:34:49,621 --> 01:34:51,760
D custom auto had a,

3524
01:34:51,790 --> 01:34:53,200
he had Floyd Patterson that was like his,

3525
01:34:53,201 --> 01:34:55,210
probably his most famous
fighter and he had,

3526
01:34:55,211 --> 01:34:55,660
um,

3527
01:34:55,660 --> 01:34:56,381
Jose Torres,

3528
01:34:56,381 --> 01:34:58,730
the guy went and wrote a tell
all book about Mike Tyson,

3529
01:34:58,731 --> 01:34:59,564
the young like Tyson.

3530
01:34:59,930 --> 01:35:00,650
Um,

3531
01:35:00,650 --> 01:35:02,880
and then he had Tyson and
he knew when he had ties.

3532
01:35:02,930 --> 01:35:03,100
Yeah,

3533
01:35:03,100 --> 01:35:04,760
Teddy Atlas of course two
and a couple of other guys.

3534
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:06,260
And Teddy was working with him back then.

3535
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:09,260
But do you hear the Tyson in
the up jumped the boogie man.

3536
01:35:09,261 --> 01:35:10,070
Mike Tyson,

3537
01:35:10,070 --> 01:35:11,150
when he's talking after,

3538
01:35:11,151 --> 01:35:11,720
he's like,

3539
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:12,110
you know,

3540
01:35:12,110 --> 01:35:12,530
he's,

3541
01:35:12,530 --> 01:35:14,630
he's confident but he's not crazy.

3542
01:35:14,631 --> 01:35:15,770
He's not eat your babies yet.

3543
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:16,310
Right?

3544
01:35:16,310 --> 01:35:16,621
He's not,

3545
01:35:16,621 --> 01:35:17,640
I'm a pet you if I can't be,

3546
01:35:17,641 --> 01:35:17,821
be,

3547
01:35:17,821 --> 01:35:19,220
and can we get starved?

3548
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,500
I each a chilled drink that Mike Tyson,

3549
01:35:23,870 --> 01:35:26,810
that was a different Mike Tyson that
was in Mike Tyson who was already red

3550
01:35:26,811 --> 01:35:27,470
lined.

3551
01:35:27,470 --> 01:35:28,700
He'd already seen too much.

3552
01:35:28,850 --> 01:35:29,930
He'd already been through too much.

3553
01:35:29,931 --> 01:35:31,610
You'd already partied too hard.

3554
01:35:31,790 --> 01:35:32,271
He'd already,

3555
01:35:32,271 --> 01:35:33,830
he'd already lost $300 million.

3556
01:35:33,831 --> 01:35:36,650
So there was already two months
losing that much money by the crazy,

3557
01:35:36,651 --> 01:35:38,240
crazy life around him.

3558
01:35:38,450 --> 01:35:39,061
Million Dollars.

3559
01:35:39,061 --> 01:35:39,340
So what do you,

3560
01:35:39,340 --> 01:35:39,980
how do you lose?

3561
01:35:39,980 --> 01:35:41,840
I think it was like
when you see him there,

3562
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:42,351
in there,

3563
01:35:42,351 --> 01:35:44,300
in that image and then
up jumped the boogie man.

3564
01:35:44,301 --> 01:35:45,410
He's a young man,

3565
01:35:45,530 --> 01:35:50,530
he's living in the Catskills in New York
in an old man's house and he's being

3566
01:35:50,841 --> 01:35:52,240
taken care of like a,

3567
01:35:52,250 --> 01:35:52,940
a plot,

3568
01:35:52,940 --> 01:35:56,830
a prime like at like the best prodigy of,

3569
01:35:56,840 --> 01:35:59,300
of master could ever have
in his last days of life.

3570
01:35:59,450 --> 01:36:01,910
It's like an incredible
story that's out of a movie.

3571
01:36:02,090 --> 01:36:04,820
You have a boxing master who's
not just the boxing master,

3572
01:36:04,821 --> 01:36:08,750
but a master of psychology and
the psychology of combat sports.

3573
01:36:08,990 --> 01:36:13,040
And he has stories to go along with
every one of his lessons and he puts this

3574
01:36:13,041 --> 01:36:16,880
kid in harm's danger in harm's
way over and over again,

3575
01:36:16,881 --> 01:36:21,550
slowly but surely an amateur boxing
competitions while teaching him all these

3576
01:36:21,551 --> 01:36:22,850
psychological principles.

3577
01:36:22,851 --> 01:36:24,860
And this kid can recite them
back and forth with you.

3578
01:36:25,070 --> 01:36:27,650
And as long as he's under the
tutelage of this great master,

3579
01:36:27,830 --> 01:36:29,360
he's almost invincible.

3580
01:36:29,510 --> 01:36:31,550
And then right after his master dies,

3581
01:36:31,670 --> 01:36:33,350
that's when shit starts getting crazy.

3582
01:36:33,351 --> 01:36:34,670
That's when he loses himself.

3583
01:36:34,671 --> 01:36:35,630
And that's when he's not,

3584
01:36:35,750 --> 01:36:39,450
he's not that same guy after years
and years of not being around cussing

3585
01:36:39,451 --> 01:36:39,950
anymore.

3586
01:36:39,950 --> 01:36:42,190
Not having that sort of
relationship or figure,

3587
01:36:42,470 --> 01:36:43,760
not just a father figure,

3588
01:36:43,761 --> 01:36:44,031
but,

3589
01:36:44,031 --> 01:36:44,420
uh,

3590
01:36:44,420 --> 01:36:49,420
the masterful mentor that every young
athlete wishes he came across when he was

3591
01:36:49,761 --> 01:36:50,594
an orphan.

3592
01:36:50,750 --> 01:36:51,051
I mean,

3593
01:36:51,051 --> 01:36:51,440
his,

3594
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:54,200
his story is so incredibly unique,

3595
01:36:54,470 --> 01:36:54,741
you know,

3596
01:36:54,741 --> 01:36:56,430
and I think they did a good job of,

3597
01:36:56,510 --> 01:36:58,550
of touching on certain aspects of it.

3598
01:36:58,551 --> 01:37:00,080
And that movie with Michael Jai White,

3599
01:37:00,081 --> 01:37:00,261
you know,

3600
01:37:00,261 --> 01:37:01,094
Michael John [inaudible],

3601
01:37:01,410 --> 01:37:01,840
I could drive.

3602
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:02,571
Why did a great job,

3603
01:37:02,571 --> 01:37:03,404
he's a bad motherfucker.

3604
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:04,011
And you know,

3605
01:37:04,011 --> 01:37:04,641
you believe in,

3606
01:37:04,641 --> 01:37:06,260
when you look at him that he's a beast.

3607
01:37:06,261 --> 01:37:06,411
You know,

3608
01:37:06,411 --> 01:37:07,040
Michael J.

3609
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:07,400
White,

3610
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:09,320
he's a really talented striker.

3611
01:37:09,380 --> 01:37:09,711
Like if,

3612
01:37:09,711 --> 01:37:09,920
you know,

3613
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:11,480
you've ever seen that guy work out before?

3614
01:37:12,070 --> 01:37:12,980
I've seen the actor.

3615
01:37:13,030 --> 01:37:13,280
Yeah.

3616
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:13,610
Tyson.

3617
01:37:13,610 --> 01:37:14,180
Oh really sad.

3618
01:37:14,180 --> 01:37:15,440
A lot of coke or Christian fights.

3619
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:15,991
Oh really?

3620
01:37:15,991 --> 01:37:16,521
A lot of them.

3621
01:37:16,521 --> 01:37:16,791
Yeah.

3622
01:37:16,791 --> 01:37:17,440
And he's,

3623
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:20,570
he's a legit black belt and
be like several different,

3624
01:37:20,571 --> 01:37:22,670
I think more than one
different martial art.

3625
01:37:22,671 --> 01:37:23,790
He's a legit blackbelt.

3626
01:37:23,850 --> 01:37:24,230
Wow.

3627
01:37:24,230 --> 01:37:24,441
Yeah.

3628
01:37:24,441 --> 01:37:25,274
There's also,

3629
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:28,490
you seem like you've ever watched
those videos where he's done a bunch of

3630
01:37:28,491 --> 01:37:29,241
martial arts movies.

3631
01:37:29,241 --> 01:37:31,460
You see Michael Jai white
throat kicks like that.

3632
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:34,310
Motherfucker's got perfect
technique with everything he does.

3633
01:37:34,550 --> 01:37:37,340
He's like a really high level
black belt and striking.

3634
01:37:37,341 --> 01:37:37,760
Wow,

3635
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:39,650
so his movements when he walked,

3636
01:37:39,651 --> 01:37:40,460
you watched him play tight.

3637
01:37:40,460 --> 01:37:41,330
It wasn't offensive,

3638
01:37:41,570 --> 01:37:44,780
but I don't think they
captured the madness.

3639
01:37:45,110 --> 01:37:48,170
That was his childhood and
how it led to beat him.

3640
01:37:48,171 --> 01:37:48,831
Maybe I'm wrong.

3641
01:37:48,831 --> 01:37:51,810
Maybe if I went back again and I would
say that it just forgot about it because

3642
01:37:51,820 --> 01:37:53,000
I remember the box can,

3643
01:37:53,001 --> 01:37:56,320
I don't think a two hour
movie will can capture what

3644
01:37:56,320 --> 01:38:00,240
what forges someone like a
phenomenon like Mike Tyson.

3645
01:38:00,260 --> 01:38:02,730
The movies never going to
capture the real thing.

3646
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:04,920
Nobody would have thing
that we just watched.

3647
01:38:05,130 --> 01:38:09,330
What's amazing about it is not just the
fact that we were watching a Guy Punch a

3648
01:38:09,331 --> 01:38:10,164
guy and do all this.

3649
01:38:10,260 --> 01:38:11,940
There's the fact that
it actually happened.

3650
01:38:12,150 --> 01:38:17,150
That is a video of reality that took
place that's undeniable and we saw

3651
01:38:17,191 --> 01:38:19,140
something incredibly special happened.

3652
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:23,310
I think what's even just as amazing in
some ways to fish from an American like

3653
01:38:23,330 --> 01:38:24,570
phenomenon,

3654
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:25,470
you know as a,

3655
01:38:25,471 --> 01:38:25,711
as a,

3656
01:38:25,711 --> 01:38:29,670
as a figure of the 20th century is the
fact that he has a one man show that

3657
01:38:29,671 --> 01:38:32,160
sells out all over the world in theaters.

3658
01:38:32,210 --> 01:38:32,520
Dude,

3659
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:35,700
I have a picture with him is like one
of the happiest moments in my life.

3660
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:37,170
Me like first of all,

3661
01:38:37,171 --> 01:38:38,100
if you go to that show,

3662
01:38:38,190 --> 01:38:38,431
no,

3663
01:38:38,431 --> 01:38:41,640
he was at the UFC and the UFC many
times I've got a picture of him.

3664
01:38:41,640 --> 01:38:43,410
I put it on the Instagram and it was like,

3665
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:44,350
I've never been more proud.

3666
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:45,310
He knows who you are

3667
01:38:49,770 --> 01:38:50,910
and that's the same kind of,

3668
01:38:50,930 --> 01:38:53,280
that's the same thing as where Laurence
Fishburne came up to me and he goes,

3669
01:38:53,281 --> 01:38:54,300
I want to meet Joe Rogan man.

3670
01:38:54,340 --> 01:38:54,880
Bring them over.

3671
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:56,280
I was like going to be my buddy.

3672
01:38:56,281 --> 01:38:57,490
I'm sure he'd love to meet you.

3673
01:38:57,570 --> 01:38:58,410
That was so weird,

3674
01:38:58,411 --> 01:38:58,820
man.

3675
01:38:58,820 --> 01:39:01,020
I'm telling you that
because I'm a fan man.

3676
01:39:01,060 --> 01:39:01,441
You were like,

3677
01:39:01,441 --> 01:39:01,591
yeah,

3678
01:39:01,591 --> 01:39:02,424
well I'm a fan of here.

3679
01:39:02,810 --> 01:39:03,980
That's Morpheus.

3680
01:39:04,730 --> 01:39:05,400
Morpheus,

3681
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:06,233
Levy's.

3682
01:39:06,630 --> 01:39:06,871
Yeah.

3683
01:39:06,871 --> 01:39:07,720
That was really cool.

3684
01:39:07,721 --> 01:39:07,891
It was.

3685
01:39:07,891 --> 01:39:08,940
He's a very nice guy.

3686
01:39:08,970 --> 01:39:09,721
He's a great guy,

3687
01:39:09,721 --> 01:39:10,220
man.

3688
01:39:10,220 --> 01:39:12,120
I spent two months with them
coming out in the movie.

3689
01:39:12,660 --> 01:39:15,210
I'm so proud to be in a movie
with Laurence Fishburne,

3690
01:39:15,211 --> 01:39:15,800
man.

3691
01:39:15,800 --> 01:39:16,440
I'm,

3692
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:18,450
I'm always like,

3693
01:39:18,540 --> 01:39:20,700
there's certain guys like that level,

3694
01:39:20,850 --> 01:39:21,900
like you're always like,

3695
01:39:21,901 --> 01:39:22,621
wow,

3696
01:39:22,621 --> 01:39:23,880
I can't even believe I'm talking to you.

3697
01:39:24,060 --> 01:39:25,080
Nick Knowlton pretty well.

3698
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:30,880
Nick naulty is the most down to Earth
motherfucker you will ever meet Nick Nolte

3699
01:39:30,881 --> 01:39:34,040
to I ran into him at
Fry's electronics and uh,

3700
01:39:34,050 --> 01:39:34,291
it's like,

3701
01:39:34,291 --> 01:39:38,070
oh hey Jola when you're buying
a video card for my kid,

3702
01:39:38,250 --> 01:39:38,610
you're not.

3703
01:39:38,610 --> 01:39:39,510
Do you know anything about these things?

3704
01:39:39,511 --> 01:39:42,690
Like had like a list and his glasses,

3705
01:39:45,140 --> 01:39:46,920
his son was really into computers.

3706
01:39:47,570 --> 01:39:52,200
He's hooking to sun up some
stuff for his computer fries.

3707
01:39:52,201 --> 01:39:52,981
If you've never been there,

3708
01:39:52,981 --> 01:39:53,970
it's like fucking key.

3709
01:39:53,971 --> 01:39:54,361
Kevin,

3710
01:39:54,361 --> 01:39:55,080
have you ever been there?

3711
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:58,950
I've been there with you 1516
years ago and I never forgot this.

3712
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:00,210
This is literally 16,

3713
01:40:00,211 --> 01:40:01,044
17 years ago.

3714
01:40:01,110 --> 01:40:04,710
And you were not only were you
on the internet or something,

3715
01:40:04,711 --> 01:40:05,131
but you,

3716
01:40:05,131 --> 01:40:05,760
you,

3717
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:10,760
you literally went to get a more memory
for your computer and you came out with

3718
01:40:11,161 --> 01:40:12,090
a switchboard.

3719
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:12,960
I'll never forget this.

3720
01:40:12,961 --> 01:40:13,680
I was like,

3721
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:14,400
dude,

3722
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:16,140
this guy's a genius.

3723
01:40:16,590 --> 01:40:17,730
He must be a scientist.

3724
01:40:17,731 --> 01:40:19,990
Like I was like more memory for here.

3725
01:40:20,070 --> 01:40:21,870
I didn't even know what the
fuck you were talking about.

3726
01:40:22,050 --> 01:40:25,770
And you bought like a switchboard that
you were going to put into your computer.

3727
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:25,951
Well,

3728
01:40:25,951 --> 01:40:26,940
it's just memory sticks.

3729
01:40:26,941 --> 01:40:27,780
It's not difficult.

3730
01:40:27,790 --> 01:40:28,980
That's strange to me.

3731
01:40:28,981 --> 01:40:31,920
I remember just clip it in
place and it's not hard.

3732
01:40:31,950 --> 01:40:33,640
Memory is one of the
easiest things to ever.

3733
01:40:33,690 --> 01:40:35,220
You were online so far,

3734
01:40:35,250 --> 01:40:37,680
you were on line five years
before I even had an email.

3735
01:40:37,710 --> 01:40:37,981
Well,

3736
01:40:37,981 --> 01:40:39,930
I was online because my
friend Robbie Printz,

3737
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:40,531
Robbie Printz,

3738
01:40:40,531 --> 01:40:44,100
a hilarious comedian from Boston
that I came up with and Robbie was a,

3739
01:40:44,101 --> 01:40:45,330
he sold computers,

3740
01:40:45,810 --> 01:40:46,410
uh,

3741
01:40:46,410 --> 01:40:48,270
before he became a comedian.

3742
01:40:48,450 --> 01:40:50,610
And so when we were starting out together,

3743
01:40:50,611 --> 01:40:53,100
we were both in California
around the same time.

3744
01:40:53,110 --> 01:40:53,980
They were on 94.

3745
01:40:54,430 --> 01:40:54,820
Um,

3746
01:40:54,820 --> 01:40:57,140
he was out here doing some stand up and I,

3747
01:40:57,141 --> 01:40:58,850
I was out here and um,

3748
01:40:58,900 --> 01:41:00,880
he took me to an apple store.

3749
01:41:00,881 --> 01:41:01,031
No,

3750
01:41:01,031 --> 01:41:01,841
it wasn't even an apple store.

3751
01:41:01,841 --> 01:41:05,770
It was comp USA might not have
even been apple stores back then.

3752
01:41:06,010 --> 01:41:08,260
And I don't remember who took
me to buy my first computer.

3753
01:41:08,510 --> 01:41:08,811
Yeah,

3754
01:41:08,811 --> 01:41:09,281
I remember that.

3755
01:41:09,281 --> 01:41:09,491
Yeah,

3756
01:41:09,491 --> 01:41:09,941
totally.

3757
01:41:09,941 --> 01:41:10,211
I was like,

3758
01:41:10,211 --> 01:41:11,470
you don't get online bitch.

3759
01:41:12,490 --> 01:41:12,840
Massive.

3760
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:13,331
We should buy it.

3761
01:41:13,331 --> 01:41:13,550
I was like,

3762
01:41:13,550 --> 01:41:13,770
oh,

3763
01:41:13,770 --> 01:41:14,320
okay.

3764
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:14,920
Yeah,

3765
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:16,090
I can get this,

3766
01:41:16,091 --> 01:41:16,421
get this,

3767
01:41:16,421 --> 01:41:17,170
get this.

3768
01:41:17,170 --> 01:41:18,670
Walked out with like some
crazy amount of money.

3769
01:41:18,671 --> 01:41:18,980
Right.

3770
01:41:18,980 --> 01:41:19,270
You know,

3771
01:41:19,270 --> 01:41:19,720
it was like,

3772
01:41:19,720 --> 01:41:23,120
it's up was a smart move though
and you need to get on it more.

3773
01:41:23,150 --> 01:41:24,620
You're really bad with your,

3774
01:41:24,790 --> 01:41:27,800
we were talking about this like tweets
promoting yourself and tweeting and stuff

3775
01:41:27,950 --> 01:41:29,630
and also you've got a lot to say,

3776
01:41:29,631 --> 01:41:29,960
man.

3777
01:41:29,960 --> 01:41:30,231
You know what?

3778
01:41:30,231 --> 01:41:33,530
I'm glad you're finally doing that in
these podcasts and I think you should

3779
01:41:33,531 --> 01:41:34,364
write two.

3780
01:41:34,370 --> 01:41:34,940
I am writing.

3781
01:41:34,940 --> 01:41:35,780
You should write a blog.

3782
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:36,571
No,

3783
01:41:36,571 --> 01:41:36,851
and I,

3784
01:41:36,851 --> 01:41:37,350
I,

3785
01:41:37,350 --> 01:41:37,591
you know,

3786
01:41:37,591 --> 01:41:38,420
I'm really excited.

3787
01:41:38,420 --> 01:41:39,750
The podcast thanks to you,

3788
01:41:39,751 --> 01:41:42,570
like just having done it and what I
like the difference is what I do is I'll

3789
01:41:42,571 --> 01:41:43,320
take,

3790
01:41:43,320 --> 01:41:45,830
I read a book that I think
is great and I get the,

3791
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:46,110
if the,

3792
01:41:46,110 --> 01:41:48,300
if I think it's somebody
who's got something to say,

3793
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:49,350
um,

3794
01:41:49,350 --> 01:41:53,010
I will put him on the podcast and I had
these conversations with these fucking

3795
01:41:53,011 --> 01:41:55,650
award winning historians
like Charles Mann of just,

3796
01:41:55,651 --> 01:41:56,461
I just did a pockets.

3797
01:41:56,461 --> 01:42:00,150
This guy wrote 1491 1493 sort
of the world before Columbus.

3798
01:42:00,540 --> 01:42:02,100
And the Shit I learned about like,

3799
01:42:02,101 --> 01:42:07,101
just like basically things like why in
the south black they use black labor as

3800
01:42:07,621 --> 01:42:11,430
opposed to white indentured servants was
because they were resistant to malaria.

3801
01:42:11,820 --> 01:42:15,950
They were just able to add a genetic
like resistance or the fact that that uh,

3802
01:42:16,040 --> 01:42:17,760
tomatoes and potatoes,

3803
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:21,180
you know where they come from
South America and Europe,

3804
01:42:21,750 --> 01:42:25,110
Italian food for 500 years
is basically fusion cuisine.

3805
01:42:25,130 --> 01:42:28,470
The Italian didn't grow tomatoes until
they got them from South America.

3806
01:42:29,020 --> 01:42:29,760
Yeah.

3807
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:33,270
Potatoes change the landscape
cause he grow the hunter to,

3808
01:42:33,320 --> 01:42:34,530
when did they get the tomato?

3809
01:42:34,531 --> 01:42:37,740
The Colombian exchange in the 1,402 when,

3810
01:42:37,741 --> 01:42:38,250
when,

3811
01:42:38,250 --> 01:42:38,581
when,

3812
01:42:38,581 --> 01:42:40,150
when Spaniards and,

3813
01:42:40,151 --> 01:42:40,831
and you know,

3814
01:42:40,831 --> 01:42:45,720
and the French and w work coming into
South America and this area and they,

3815
01:42:45,721 --> 01:42:47,910
and they would bring pigs with them
so they could eat him on board.

3816
01:42:47,911 --> 01:42:49,950
The pigs would get off with
escape into the forest.

3817
01:42:49,980 --> 01:42:52,170
They carry a lot of
communicable diseases to humans.

3818
01:42:52,290 --> 01:42:53,011
That's how they think.

3819
01:42:53,011 --> 01:42:54,960
A lot of a lot of these communities,

3820
01:42:55,110 --> 01:42:59,460
these vast communities of Indians and
Charles c man said that there may have

3821
01:42:59,461 --> 01:43:04,461
been up to 50 to 80 million inhabitants
of the United States when white people

3822
01:43:06,031 --> 01:43:06,960
first came here.

3823
01:43:06,961 --> 01:43:07,860
How about that?

3824
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:09,180
That's what most,

3825
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:11,070
this is the kind of
shit I'm talking about.

3826
01:43:11,071 --> 01:43:11,220
So,

3827
01:43:11,220 --> 01:43:11,820
so,

3828
01:43:11,820 --> 01:43:12,031
you know,

3829
01:43:12,031 --> 01:43:15,240
you hear about this stuff and
they were all decimated by,

3830
01:43:15,270 --> 01:43:15,810
by,

3831
01:43:15,810 --> 01:43:16,441
by disease.

3832
01:43:16,441 --> 01:43:19,980
I mean literally it could have been as
easy as when they were coming up the

3833
01:43:19,981 --> 01:43:21,690
Mississippi Delta with their pigs.

3834
01:43:21,870 --> 01:43:25,980
It could have been 60 people brought
diseases that no one had any,

3835
01:43:25,981 --> 01:43:27,870
no one had any fucking,

3836
01:43:27,871 --> 01:43:28,704
you know,

3837
01:43:28,740 --> 01:43:29,700
a resistance to,

3838
01:43:29,730 --> 01:43:30,421
they all died.

3839
01:43:30,421 --> 01:43:31,440
So when they came back,

3840
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:36,480
the entire area was abandoned.

3841
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:39,990
It was just clay pottery and
stone and nothing was there

3842
01:43:40,370 --> 01:43:43,520
crazy because you know we were always
taught that there was nobody here.

3843
01:43:43,550 --> 01:43:43,900
Oh,

3844
01:43:43,900 --> 01:43:45,170
just a few Indians,

3845
01:43:45,220 --> 01:43:49,840
50 to 80 million according to the
latest estimates by historians now and

3846
01:43:49,841 --> 01:43:51,280
archeologists paleontologist.

3847
01:43:51,470 --> 01:43:52,160
So

3848
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:56,030
the numbers are vastly larger
than we thought and that,

3849
01:43:56,150 --> 01:43:58,790
I mean a good percentage of
it was straight genocide.

3850
01:43:59,000 --> 01:43:59,241
Well,

3851
01:43:59,241 --> 01:43:59,720
I mean there was,

3852
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:01,670
there's a lot of genocide
involved as well,

3853
01:44:01,671 --> 01:44:02,131
but my brand,

3854
01:44:02,131 --> 01:44:04,090
that trail of tears and all the,

3855
01:44:04,240 --> 01:44:08,180
I mean even long before that they
still have reservations to this day.

3856
01:44:08,210 --> 01:44:10,100
Long before that though was disease.

3857
01:44:10,130 --> 01:44:13,730
What they think is that disease really
truly decimated 90% of the population.

3858
01:44:13,731 --> 01:44:14,120
But you know what?

3859
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:16,280
I don't think it's even
important to differentiate.

3860
01:44:16,281 --> 01:44:18,890
What we don't actually know
long before was disease.

3861
01:44:18,891 --> 01:44:20,630
But we do know two things took place.

3862
01:44:20,640 --> 01:44:21,351
Hideous histories,

3863
01:44:21,351 --> 01:44:22,790
way too muddy I think to do that.

3864
01:44:23,120 --> 01:44:24,470
But I think we do know two things.

3865
01:44:24,471 --> 01:44:28,040
We know they definitely
got a lot of diseases from
Europeans and they definitely

3866
01:44:28,041 --> 01:44:29,110
were murdered by Europeans.

3867
01:44:29,540 --> 01:44:30,350
We know both.

3868
01:44:30,350 --> 01:44:31,590
So I think when you say,

3869
01:44:31,591 --> 01:44:31,731
well,

3870
01:44:31,731 --> 01:44:32,541
this happened first,

3871
01:44:32,541 --> 01:44:36,200
and that happens second boy that gets
squirrely when you're talking about 1492

3872
01:44:36,440 --> 01:44:37,610
that it gets real squirrely,

3873
01:44:38,390 --> 01:44:39,680
very warlike with each other.

3874
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:40,513
By the way.

3875
01:44:40,590 --> 01:44:40,880
I mean,

3876
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:42,620
they were savages,

3877
01:44:42,950 --> 01:44:44,960
Columbus and those people
were all fucking savage.

3878
01:44:46,580 --> 01:44:47,391
It's so straight.

3879
01:44:47,391 --> 01:44:49,010
Slavery was the order of the day.

3880
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:52,450
One of the great turning points
in history was the abolitionist.

3881
01:44:52,451 --> 01:44:56,450
A worldwide abolition is
moving the worldwide movement
to end slavery was done.

3882
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:59,660
So like nobody thought
these were like fanatical.

3883
01:44:59,661 --> 01:45:01,640
Usually religious people at the most part.

3884
01:45:01,650 --> 01:45:02,451
Slavery,

3885
01:45:02,451 --> 01:45:03,231
if you think about it,

3886
01:45:03,231 --> 01:45:06,470
throughout the history of
human was the order of things.

3887
01:45:06,650 --> 01:45:07,850
It was just the birth.

3888
01:45:07,851 --> 01:45:09,860
You took everyone from Aristotle,

3889
01:45:09,861 --> 01:45:10,400
Socrates,

3890
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:11,510
they all had slaves.

3891
01:45:11,511 --> 01:45:11,930
I mean,

3892
01:45:11,930 --> 01:45:16,930
it went all the way up until the idea
that you could actually change the,

3893
01:45:17,570 --> 01:45:17,841
the,

3894
01:45:17,841 --> 01:45:21,140
the how we look at human
humanity as you're not channeled.

3895
01:45:21,150 --> 01:45:21,530
You don't,

3896
01:45:21,530 --> 01:45:23,120
you shouldn't belong to somebody.

3897
01:45:23,450 --> 01:45:26,960
Wasn't was so not in people's Pantheon.

3898
01:45:27,140 --> 01:45:27,560
You,

3899
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:29,570
when you were conquered by another army,

3900
01:45:29,571 --> 01:45:31,550
you were simply sold into slavery.

3901
01:45:31,820 --> 01:45:31,941
Uh,

3902
01:45:31,941 --> 01:45:33,170
Constantinople,

3903
01:45:33,290 --> 01:45:34,280
which was a society,

3904
01:45:34,340 --> 01:45:37,820
a civilization stand that
stood for a thousand years.

3905
01:45:37,821 --> 01:45:38,570
It was the,

3906
01:45:38,570 --> 01:45:43,570
the heart of Christianity when it
fell in the 14 hundreds feet entire,

3907
01:45:43,850 --> 01:45:45,260
those that weren't put to the sword,

3908
01:45:45,261 --> 01:45:46,100
the rest of them,

3909
01:45:46,101 --> 01:45:47,390
probably 50 to a hundred thousand,

3910
01:45:47,420 --> 01:45:49,250
which is sold into slavery.

3911
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:50,990
And that was the order.

3912
01:45:50,991 --> 01:45:52,070
That's what you did.

3913
01:45:52,190 --> 01:45:52,731
So sorry.

3914
01:45:52,731 --> 01:45:54,920
I know you've got a family and
stuff were taking your kids stop it,

3915
01:45:54,921 --> 01:45:55,460
you know,

3916
01:45:55,460 --> 01:45:56,050
and you just,

3917
01:45:56,050 --> 01:45:57,680
the brutality is beyond what,

3918
01:45:57,740 --> 01:45:57,951
you know,

3919
01:45:57,951 --> 01:45:58,970
people come in and again,

3920
01:45:58,971 --> 01:46:01,940
I think it has to do with
what people are used to,

3921
01:46:02,280 --> 01:46:04,250
that that was what they grew up with.

3922
01:46:04,251 --> 01:46:05,210
That's what they saw.

3923
01:46:05,211 --> 01:46:06,410
That's what they were used to.

3924
01:46:06,620 --> 01:46:09,410
There was when you were talking about
Lincoln's kids dying and that was even

3925
01:46:09,411 --> 01:46:10,220
worse back then.

3926
01:46:10,220 --> 01:46:10,791
Short way,

3927
01:46:10,791 --> 01:46:13,220
we're sure there was a
wellspring of misery.

3928
01:46:13,220 --> 01:46:13,521
You know,

3929
01:46:13,521 --> 01:46:13,841
where,

3930
01:46:13,841 --> 01:46:17,600
where if you had an abscess in your
tooth or rheumatoid arthritis in bitch,

3931
01:46:17,780 --> 01:46:18,410
it's a wrap.

3932
01:46:18,410 --> 01:46:19,160
You Die.

3933
01:46:19,160 --> 01:46:19,341
Yeah.

3934
01:46:19,341 --> 01:46:20,360
You get staph infection,

3935
01:46:20,390 --> 01:46:22,520
take care of and he scratch.

3936
01:46:22,521 --> 01:46:26,090
You get from hammering nails to try to
build the house to keep your children,

3937
01:46:26,110 --> 01:46:27,140
but you might lose your hand.

3938
01:46:27,170 --> 01:46:28,003
That's right.

3939
01:46:28,190 --> 01:46:29,060
Soon as possible.

3940
01:46:29,130 --> 01:46:29,601
And that was it.

3941
01:46:29,601 --> 01:46:29,801
But,

3942
01:46:29,801 --> 01:46:30,321
but what,

3943
01:46:30,321 --> 01:46:34,340
what the other side of it was that kind
of contact with humanity was a great

3944
01:46:34,341 --> 01:46:35,650
deal of trade and,

3945
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:40,680
and so potatoes kept Europeans alive
for it because you grow on the ground,

3946
01:46:40,820 --> 01:46:41,990
they're not as vulnerable as wheat.

3947
01:46:42,020 --> 01:46:43,550
Wheat in the wind will answer.

3948
01:46:43,580 --> 01:46:44,520
You get a hailstorm,

3949
01:46:44,580 --> 01:46:45,620
potato Stan to the ground.

3950
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:48,470
When a marauding army comes
in to take all your shit.

3951
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:48,760
They,

3952
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:49,920
they're not looking at the ground.

3953
01:46:49,950 --> 01:46:50,100
You

3954
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:51,660
got all your food and a sweet potato,

3955
01:46:52,250 --> 01:46:53,170
a and even a potato.

3956
01:46:53,190 --> 01:46:53,941
But you can,

3957
01:46:53,941 --> 01:46:57,660
you can basically with a
sweet potato and with milk,

3958
01:46:58,080 --> 01:46:59,040
with milk products,

3959
01:46:59,070 --> 01:46:59,910
you can live,

3960
01:47:00,120 --> 01:47:01,170
you could thrive.

3961
01:47:01,350 --> 01:47:06,350
So you had entire communities in Europe
who were building and the Europe was

3962
01:47:06,871 --> 01:47:09,270
built essentially all of Europe
was built not just on bread,

3963
01:47:09,271 --> 01:47:10,140
but on potatoes.

3964
01:47:10,141 --> 01:47:13,020
When potatoes came in and tomatoes and,

3965
01:47:13,021 --> 01:47:14,820
and you had milk products like cheese,

3966
01:47:14,970 --> 01:47:15,990
you're basically fine.

3967
01:47:16,020 --> 01:47:16,381
You will,

3968
01:47:16,381 --> 01:47:17,011
you will be fine.

3969
01:47:17,011 --> 01:47:18,120
You'll grow into a big strong boy.

3970
01:47:18,250 --> 01:47:18,491
Well,

3971
01:47:18,491 --> 01:47:23,491
nutrition is such an underrated aspect
of like why people succeed and why they

3972
01:47:24,251 --> 01:47:24,960
failed.

3973
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:26,560
And not just in,

3974
01:47:26,561 --> 01:47:28,120
in terms of like nations,

3975
01:47:28,270 --> 01:47:30,010
but in terms of human beings that,

3976
01:47:30,011 --> 01:47:30,844
you know,

3977
01:47:30,970 --> 01:47:34,380
like the people that take
care of their nutrition and,

3978
01:47:34,381 --> 01:47:35,830
and give their body nutrients,

3979
01:47:36,040 --> 01:47:37,270
their bodies work better,

3980
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:38,650
their brain works better,

3981
01:47:38,890 --> 01:47:40,000
they make more sense.

3982
01:47:40,300 --> 01:47:41,170
It's really that simple.

3983
01:47:41,610 --> 01:47:44,820
One of the turning points in American
history was when we got rid of oak warm,

3984
01:47:44,821 --> 01:47:47,970
there's a scorge of hookworm
in the south after the,

3985
01:47:48,030 --> 01:47:48,863
after the civil.

3986
01:47:49,160 --> 01:47:52,160
Do you know that they're trying to
give people hookworm to cure asthma.

3987
01:47:52,250 --> 01:47:53,290
Really did.

3988
01:47:53,291 --> 01:47:53,570
Yeah.

3989
01:47:53,570 --> 01:47:54,760
Cause it makes you worry me make,

3990
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:56,870
there's something that
happens with hookworm.

3991
01:47:57,270 --> 01:47:59,090
That's a quorum stops asthma.

3992
01:47:59,160 --> 01:48:04,160
And so there was a doctor that was
trying to inject hookworm into a chronic

3993
01:48:06,081 --> 01:48:08,270
asthmatic cause they get into your feet.

3994
01:48:08,300 --> 01:48:12,190
Dr Infects himself with
Hookworm for health experiments.

3995
01:48:12,250 --> 01:48:13,040
Um,

3996
01:48:13,040 --> 01:48:14,660
this guy had,

3997
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:16,130
so he swallowed,

3998
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:17,930
he swallowed,

3999
01:48:18,020 --> 01:48:18,530
um,

4000
01:48:18,530 --> 01:48:20,310
a camera to,

4001
01:48:20,311 --> 01:48:20,501
to,

4002
01:48:20,501 --> 01:48:22,760
to film the action in his stomach.

4003
01:48:22,970 --> 01:48:24,020
He infected himself.

4004
01:48:24,021 --> 01:48:25,220
His name is Dr. James Logan.

4005
01:48:25,340 --> 01:48:29,510
In fact it himself with these
hookworms and then swallowed a pill,

4006
01:48:30,440 --> 01:48:33,740
a little tiny pill camera to
find the action in his gut.

4007
01:48:34,410 --> 01:48:36,590
That's how that guy's bad ass dude.

4008
01:48:36,620 --> 01:48:37,580
That guy's gangster.

4009
01:48:37,581 --> 01:48:38,780
That's a doctor that did that.

4010
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:40,030
Quorums make you anemic.

4011
01:48:40,070 --> 01:48:40,271
They,

4012
01:48:40,271 --> 01:48:40,471
they,

4013
01:48:40,471 --> 01:48:43,300
they rob your body of iron
and you have no energy.

4014
01:48:43,400 --> 01:48:45,200
So say straight dope.

4015
01:48:45,201 --> 01:48:46,640
We'll hook worms.

4016
01:48:46,730 --> 01:48:48,140
Relieved my asthma.

4017
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:48,711
Wow.

4018
01:48:48,711 --> 01:48:49,370
What's it say?

4019
01:48:49,370 --> 01:48:50,203
That's awesome.

4020
01:48:51,150 --> 01:48:51,340
Let me,

4021
01:48:51,340 --> 01:48:54,390
the body don't took Quinten
[inaudible] and his team.

4022
01:48:54,391 --> 01:48:58,440
I've lined up a spatial scanner which
can see through the top layers of Dr.

4023
01:48:58,440 --> 01:49:03,320
Logan skin before placing a water droplet
containing 50 hookworm larvae onto his

4024
01:49:03,321 --> 01:49:04,154
own.

4025
01:49:05,740 --> 01:49:06,870
Cause I have a right to your arm.

4026
01:49:06,950 --> 01:49:07,783
Into my skin,

4027
01:49:07,830 --> 01:49:11,000
like straight away or is it
going to take well thanks.

4028
01:49:11,100 --> 01:49:11,851
We don't really know.

4029
01:49:11,851 --> 01:49:12,960
So let's,

4030
01:49:12,961 --> 01:49:13,390
let's just,

4031
01:49:13,390 --> 01:49:13,810
okay.

4032
01:49:13,810 --> 01:49:16,960
Apparently whether or not this has
nothing to do with whether or not hookworm

4033
01:49:16,961 --> 01:49:17,651
cures asthma.

4034
01:49:17,651 --> 01:49:21,700
Unfortunately just hookworm it's in this
guy's body that they can see what the

4035
01:49:21,701 --> 01:49:22,534
camera,

4036
01:49:22,920 --> 01:49:26,320
they were a real score and
once they created outhouses,

4037
01:49:26,330 --> 01:49:29,010
when people aren't going to the
bathroom and the great outdoors,

4038
01:49:29,340 --> 01:49:30,780
cause everybody walked
around in bare feet,

4039
01:49:31,050 --> 01:49:31,361
it,

4040
01:49:31,361 --> 01:49:35,460
it changed the entire landscape of the
south and changed their entire economy.

4041
01:49:35,461 --> 01:49:39,060
Because you had communities where 90%
of the people who are anemic and had no

4042
01:49:39,061 --> 01:49:40,950
energy to work from hookworm.

4043
01:49:41,060 --> 01:49:41,893
That's incredible.

4044
01:49:41,900 --> 01:49:43,680
That changes your whole
changed everything.

4045
01:49:43,681 --> 01:49:45,390
Everything you human being as a machine,

4046
01:49:45,391 --> 01:49:45,561
you,

4047
01:49:45,561 --> 01:49:45,691
you,

4048
01:49:45,691 --> 01:49:45,990
if you,

4049
01:49:45,990 --> 01:49:48,520
if you're not gonna be able
to take care of the pathogens,

4050
01:49:48,520 --> 01:49:49,510
the diseases and stuff,

4051
01:49:49,511 --> 01:49:50,620
and people don't feel good,

4052
01:49:50,650 --> 01:49:51,880
they're not going to
be able to do anything.

4053
01:49:52,410 --> 01:49:53,920
It's like the importance of sleep.

4054
01:49:53,921 --> 01:49:57,460
I'm having a sleep expert on the podcasts
because sleep is way more important

4055
01:49:57,461 --> 01:49:57,541
than,

4056
01:49:57,541 --> 01:49:58,151
than they thought.

4057
01:49:58,151 --> 01:49:59,590
Way more important too.

4058
01:49:59,650 --> 01:50:00,890
We are all chronically understaffed.

4059
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:02,320
If you're not sleeping and hydrated,

4060
01:50:02,500 --> 01:50:04,410
then everything else falls out
that you can everything else,

4061
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:04,810
you know,

4062
01:50:04,810 --> 01:50:07,300
and I encourage people this
and I can't stop saying it.

4063
01:50:07,301 --> 01:50:09,190
I'll say it again if you can.

4064
01:50:09,191 --> 01:50:11,650
If you have access to an isolation tank,

4065
01:50:11,680 --> 01:50:12,790
please do it.

4066
01:50:13,090 --> 01:50:14,020
Please.

4067
01:50:14,230 --> 01:50:18,490
The relaxation that you get from one hour
of a sensory deprivation tank is like

4068
01:50:18,491 --> 01:50:20,740
sleeping the best eight
hours of your life.

4069
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:24,280
I got to get your body feels so loose
and good when they get out of there.

4070
01:50:24,430 --> 01:50:25,061
It's amazing.

4071
01:50:25,061 --> 01:50:26,920
And you've never had to change
the water because nothing,

4072
01:50:26,921 --> 01:50:28,300
she just changed the water.

4073
01:50:28,370 --> 01:50:29,203
Yeah.

4074
01:50:29,560 --> 01:50:29,801
Yeah.

4075
01:50:29,801 --> 01:50:32,590
It only lasts like a couple of
years and you have to swap it out.

4076
01:50:33,190 --> 01:50:33,431
I mean,

4077
01:50:33,431 --> 01:50:33,880
I've had it,

4078
01:50:33,880 --> 01:50:36,040
I've had it for five years the
most I think I've ever had,

4079
01:50:36,220 --> 01:50:39,130
but crash the guy who runs
the float labs a heel,

4080
01:50:39,131 --> 01:50:39,941
he services that.

4081
01:50:39,941 --> 01:50:41,620
If you have a unit in your house,

4082
01:50:41,621 --> 01:50:43,100
he comes to my house and get services.

4083
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:46,060
The place to go though is near you.

4084
01:50:46,061 --> 01:50:46,301
I mean,

4085
01:50:46,301 --> 01:50:48,910
you can go to float
lab.com it's in Venice.

4086
01:50:48,940 --> 01:50:49,150
Yep.

4087
01:50:49,150 --> 01:50:49,750
Been there.

4088
01:50:49,750 --> 01:50:50,190
I loved it.

4089
01:50:50,190 --> 01:50:52,960
And by the lock and incredible thought
I'd be there like I thought I could only

4090
01:50:52,961 --> 01:50:53,980
stay there for a half hour.

4091
01:50:53,981 --> 01:50:54,281
I'd be like,

4092
01:50:54,281 --> 01:50:55,114
I'd get bored.

4093
01:50:55,490 --> 01:50:56,261
Two hours went by.

4094
01:50:56,261 --> 01:50:57,094
I didn't even know.

4095
01:50:57,610 --> 01:50:58,443
You know,

4096
01:50:58,910 --> 01:51:00,160
you should be doing that all the time,

4097
01:51:00,161 --> 01:51:00,700
dude.

4098
01:51:00,700 --> 01:51:01,630
You should be doing that all the time.

4099
01:51:01,631 --> 01:51:02,260
You should.

4100
01:51:02,260 --> 01:51:03,160
You've got some cash.

4101
01:51:03,340 --> 01:51:04,900
You should get one of those
in your fucking house.

4102
01:51:04,930 --> 01:51:07,180
You really should just one of the
greatest things you could ever have.

4103
01:51:07,210 --> 01:51:07,511
I mean,

4104
01:51:07,511 --> 01:51:12,010
I have access to the most incredible
environment on earth in my house on a

4105
01:51:12,011 --> 01:51:12,820
regular basis.

4106
01:51:12,820 --> 01:51:14,170
It's changed who I am as a human being.

4107
01:51:14,660 --> 01:51:15,040
And when I,

4108
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:16,840
when I get away from it and
I don't do it for a while,

4109
01:51:16,841 --> 01:51:17,980
I start getting squirrelly.

4110
01:51:19,110 --> 01:51:19,861
It's like a need.

4111
01:51:19,861 --> 01:51:20,410
It,

4112
01:51:20,410 --> 01:51:21,820
it's like I need to get back in there.

4113
01:51:22,380 --> 01:51:22,660
It's,

4114
01:51:22,660 --> 01:51:23,710
it's a balancing.

4115
01:51:24,430 --> 01:51:24,911
Where'd you,

4116
01:51:24,911 --> 01:51:25,660
uh,

4117
01:51:25,660 --> 01:51:26,730
like learn about where,

4118
01:51:26,731 --> 01:51:26,940
where did,

4119
01:51:26,940 --> 01:51:29,260
where did you when I saw that movie with,

4120
01:51:29,261 --> 01:51:30,094
um,

4121
01:51:30,480 --> 01:51:32,350
what the fuck is my altered states?

4122
01:51:32,610 --> 01:51:33,520
Kind of.

4123
01:51:33,590 --> 01:51:34,423
Oh yeah.

4124
01:51:35,290 --> 01:51:36,123
That's a,

4125
01:51:36,220 --> 01:51:38,620
that's a come on.

4126
01:51:38,770 --> 01:51:39,603
Um,

4127
01:51:39,970 --> 01:51:40,151
yeah.

4128
01:51:40,151 --> 01:51:40,570
William hurt.

4129
01:51:40,570 --> 01:51:41,020
Is it?

4130
01:51:41,020 --> 01:51:41,853
Yup.

4131
01:51:41,950 --> 01:51:42,341
Yes.

4132
01:51:42,341 --> 01:51:42,970
It's William Hart.

4133
01:51:42,970 --> 01:51:43,151
Yeah.

4134
01:51:43,151 --> 01:51:44,100
He's a bad motherfucker.

4135
01:51:44,140 --> 01:51:44,570
Yup.

4136
01:51:44,570 --> 01:51:46,510
And that's a terrible movie by the way.

4137
01:51:46,570 --> 01:51:47,403
I try watching it now.

4138
01:51:47,410 --> 01:51:47,591
Oh,

4139
01:51:47,591 --> 01:51:49,240
God doesn't hold up at all.

4140
01:51:49,450 --> 01:51:50,440
It's terrifying.

4141
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:51,101
I was like,

4142
01:51:51,101 --> 01:51:52,120
how did I think this was good?

4143
01:51:52,121 --> 01:51:53,320
What was I retarded back then?

4144
01:51:53,470 --> 01:51:53,651
Like,

4145
01:51:53,651 --> 01:51:54,320
it's almost like I'm,

4146
01:51:54,320 --> 01:51:54,480
I'm,

4147
01:51:54,480 --> 01:51:54,671
I'm,

4148
01:51:54,671 --> 01:51:57,910
I'm a emerging from my
own ea idiotic shell.

4149
01:51:58,180 --> 01:51:58,780
Cause I,

4150
01:51:58,780 --> 01:51:59,170
it's,

4151
01:51:59,170 --> 01:52:04,170
there's weird things about these movies
that we just accepted a few years ago.

4152
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:05,620
This is a him,

4153
01:52:05,860 --> 01:52:08,560
it's based on the work of a great man,

4154
01:52:08,561 --> 01:52:09,930
a fascinating man name.

4155
01:52:09,940 --> 01:52:10,773
Um,

4156
01:52:11,110 --> 01:52:11,943
uh,

4157
01:52:12,910 --> 01:52:13,743
just the fuck's his name,

4158
01:52:14,500 --> 01:52:15,160
John Lilly,

4159
01:52:15,160 --> 01:52:15,993
Jesus Christ.

4160
01:52:16,170 --> 01:52:16,650
Um,

4161
01:52:16,650 --> 01:52:17,490
and John Lilly,

4162
01:52:17,491 --> 01:52:17,770
uh,

4163
01:52:17,770 --> 01:52:18,880
wrote the deep self,

4164
01:52:18,881 --> 01:52:20,620
which is a fascinating,

4165
01:52:20,730 --> 01:52:20,920
okay.

4166
01:52:20,920 --> 01:52:21,880
I have took on,

4167
01:52:22,180 --> 01:52:23,950
on floating and uh,

4168
01:52:23,980 --> 01:52:26,500
he also invented the sensory
deprivation tank and Lilly,

4169
01:52:26,570 --> 01:52:26,920
uh,

4170
01:52:26,920 --> 01:52:31,090
did a lot of weird shit like interspecies
communication work with dolphins where

4171
01:52:31,091 --> 01:52:32,180
he'd take acid and,

4172
01:52:32,470 --> 01:52:32,890
and uh,

4173
01:52:32,890 --> 01:52:36,730
put himself in a sensory depth
tank near a were dolphins live.

4174
01:52:37,780 --> 01:52:38,980
He did a lot of freaky shit.

4175
01:52:39,340 --> 01:52:40,320
And um,

4176
01:52:40,720 --> 01:52:41,980
his work was,

4177
01:52:42,070 --> 01:52:42,431
you know,

4178
01:52:42,431 --> 01:52:47,431
he was known to be like one of the most
daring of the psychedelic adventures.

4179
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:50,840
Lilly was thought to
be like a true madman.

4180
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:54,500
Like he would shoot ketamine and
get into the sensory depth tank.

4181
01:52:54,501 --> 01:52:55,640
That was the big thing with them.

4182
01:52:55,980 --> 01:52:58,550
My friend Todd actually has Lily's tank.

4183
01:52:59,060 --> 01:53:00,320
He actually owns Lily's tank.

4184
01:53:00,321 --> 01:53:03,560
Lily gave it to him and the first
time he ever went into a tank,

4185
01:53:03,770 --> 01:53:04,880
lily put him in his tank.

4186
01:53:04,881 --> 01:53:08,240
Lily had two tanks side by side and
they would do ketamine together.

4187
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:09,930
Ketamine is,

4188
01:53:09,930 --> 01:53:11,750
it's a fucking cat tranquilizer.

4189
01:53:12,110 --> 01:53:12,720
It's a,

4190
01:53:12,720 --> 01:53:14,210
it's a psychedelic apparently,

4191
01:53:14,211 --> 01:53:15,500
but a very dangerous one.

4192
01:53:15,501 --> 01:53:16,460
Very hardcore,

4193
01:53:16,490 --> 01:53:17,780
very addictive one,

4194
01:53:17,810 --> 01:53:18,350
by the way.

4195
01:53:18,350 --> 01:53:19,460
Not just psychologically,

4196
01:53:19,461 --> 01:53:20,510
but physically addictive.

4197
01:53:20,511 --> 01:53:21,171
One of the rare,

4198
01:53:21,171 --> 01:53:22,670
physically addictive psychedelics.

4199
01:53:23,030 --> 01:53:23,863
And um,

4200
01:53:23,900 --> 01:53:26,030
apparently Lilly loved it.

4201
01:53:26,510 --> 01:53:29,000
And the way it's described by Mckenna,

4202
01:53:29,030 --> 01:53:30,860
I've never experienced a ketamine,

4203
01:53:30,861 --> 01:53:32,840
but Wade Mckenna describes it,

4204
01:53:32,841 --> 01:53:37,841
is he believes that one of the
things you get in a psychedelic,

4205
01:53:38,391 --> 01:53:39,224
like a mushroom,

4206
01:53:39,260 --> 01:53:43,190
is that you're not just getting a
substance interacting with your brain.

4207
01:53:43,310 --> 01:53:45,680
You're actually getting a
database of experiences.

4208
01:53:45,950 --> 01:53:47,960
And that's one of the reasons
why when you take Iowasca,

4209
01:53:47,961 --> 01:53:51,680
you see Jaguars and black people and
snakes is because that's what they see in

4210
01:53:51,681 --> 01:53:52,510
the forest.

4211
01:53:52,510 --> 01:53:53,121
In the forest.

4212
01:53:53,121 --> 01:53:54,020
They see Jaguars,

4213
01:53:54,021 --> 01:53:55,550
they see black people and they see snakes.

4214
01:53:55,551 --> 01:53:56,780
That's who lives in the forest.

4215
01:53:56,930 --> 01:53:57,860
So when you take it,

4216
01:53:58,010 --> 01:54:01,490
you're literally not just taking this
substance and interact with your brain.

4217
01:54:01,491 --> 01:54:04,220
You're also taking this incredible
database of experiences,

4218
01:54:04,400 --> 01:54:09,020
which is why so many people have
extremely similar accounts of the trip.

4219
01:54:09,021 --> 01:54:14,021
The trip reports are very similar when
it comes to Iowasca and the idea is

4220
01:54:14,570 --> 01:54:15,403
ketamine.

4221
01:54:15,560 --> 01:54:17,900
The idea is that ketamine
is a very recent drug,

4222
01:54:18,050 --> 01:54:20,240
so the amount of trips are very small.

4223
01:54:20,330 --> 01:54:22,160
So when you do the ketamine trip,

4224
01:54:22,190 --> 01:54:27,190
it's not this overwhelming rush of
Mondalez and patterns in geometry and,

4225
01:54:29,070 --> 01:54:32,630
and information and Egypt and
iconography and you don't get that.

4226
01:54:32,630 --> 01:54:33,171
And Ketamine,

4227
01:54:33,171 --> 01:54:34,700
you can't like an empty building,

4228
01:54:35,180 --> 01:54:36,013
like you're in some,

4229
01:54:36,110 --> 01:54:37,100
some strange place,

4230
01:54:37,101 --> 01:54:38,000
but you're the only one.

4231
01:54:38,001 --> 01:54:38,810
They're like,

4232
01:54:38,810 --> 01:54:41,480
you're going through these giant empty
and occasionally someone's watching you.

4233
01:54:41,750 --> 01:54:45,700
Occasionally you'll see like a lurker
who's re looking behind walls and there

4234
01:54:45,740 --> 01:54:46,970
they're paying attention to you,

4235
01:54:46,971 --> 01:54:51,380
but it's like you're in this freaky
psychedelic journey where very few people

4236
01:54:51,381 --> 01:54:52,041
have gone before.

4237
01:54:52,041 --> 01:54:55,370
So you might not even encounter
other experiences or travelers,

4238
01:54:55,610 --> 01:55:00,610
but if you do it together with someone
apparently can go somewhere together.

4239
01:55:00,980 --> 01:55:02,780
And this is what lily used to do.

4240
01:55:02,900 --> 01:55:04,510
Little used to like he,

4241
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:05,600
he asked my friend,

4242
01:55:05,601 --> 01:55:05,931
he goes like,

4243
01:55:05,931 --> 01:55:06,380
do you want to,

4244
01:55:06,380 --> 01:55:07,640
you want to do ketamine with this?

4245
01:55:07,730 --> 01:55:09,200
Cause it was the first
time they'd ever done,

4246
01:55:09,230 --> 01:55:09,740
um,

4247
01:55:09,740 --> 01:55:10,573
isolation tank.

4248
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:11,241
He's like,

4249
01:55:11,241 --> 01:55:11,890
sure.

4250
01:55:11,890 --> 01:55:12,161
You know,

4251
01:55:12,161 --> 01:55:12,340
like,

4252
01:55:12,340 --> 01:55:12,711
he's like,

4253
01:55:12,711 --> 01:55:15,860
I couldn't say no to John Lilly who's
holding a fucking syringe full of

4254
01:55:15,861 --> 01:55:16,310
ketamine.

4255
01:55:16,310 --> 01:55:17,990
He had a prep for him and he's like,

4256
01:55:18,020 --> 01:55:18,531
Bam,

4257
01:55:18,531 --> 01:55:20,390
I would have hit some intramuscularly.

4258
01:55:20,450 --> 01:55:21,283
And then just,

4259
01:55:21,320 --> 01:55:23,960
and then apparently my friend
was like yelling some shit out.

4260
01:55:24,410 --> 01:55:24,950
I don't know,

4261
01:55:24,950 --> 01:55:25,890
Todd McCormick is,

4262
01:55:26,240 --> 01:55:28,160
he's much better at telling
the story than I am.

4263
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:33,400
But he apparently had yelled out and
so lily went to go like rescue him.

4264
01:55:33,560 --> 01:55:36,380
So Lilly banged himself with the ketamine,

4265
01:55:36,620 --> 01:55:38,000
gets in the tank next to him,

4266
01:55:38,270 --> 01:55:43,070
his two tanks Hopsin the second tank and
meets them on whatever fucking channel

4267
01:55:43,080 --> 01:55:43,590
he's on.

4268
01:55:43,590 --> 01:55:44,423
Wow.

4269
01:55:44,580 --> 01:55:44,881
Yeah.

4270
01:55:44,881 --> 01:55:49,710
And he like literally has a physical
memory of Lilly coming and communicating

4271
01:55:49,711 --> 01:55:51,540
with him in this ketamine world.

4272
01:55:51,570 --> 01:55:52,200
Wow.

4273
01:55:52,200 --> 01:55:56,790
That's also been established
of certain tryptamines like um,

4274
01:55:57,090 --> 01:55:57,930
Iowasca.

4275
01:55:58,140 --> 01:55:58,650
Um,

4276
01:55:58,650 --> 01:55:58,980
the,

4277
01:55:58,980 --> 01:56:01,590
one of the elements in Iowasca is this,

4278
01:56:01,680 --> 01:56:02,700
this plant,

4279
01:56:02,730 --> 01:56:04,290
this chemical called harming.

4280
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:06,990
And when they first identified it,

4281
01:56:07,350 --> 01:56:11,180
they were going to call it
telepathy scene because it didn't,

4282
01:56:11,220 --> 01:56:11,730
they,

4283
01:56:11,730 --> 01:56:12,960
when they took it together,

4284
01:56:13,080 --> 01:56:14,550
they encountered this group,

4285
01:56:14,551 --> 01:56:17,580
state of telepathy that
they all recounted.

4286
01:56:17,730 --> 01:56:21,390
They all recounted the same experiences
while they were taking this Iowasca,

4287
01:56:21,391 --> 01:56:25,200
these early p or similar enough in
their description because there are so

4288
01:56:25,201 --> 01:56:26,130
fantastical.

4289
01:56:26,250 --> 01:56:29,460
It was hard to really wrap your
head around exactly what you saw.

4290
01:56:29,730 --> 01:56:33,690
But it was similar enough that they were
convinced that they were having some

4291
01:56:33,691 --> 01:56:35,700
sort of a group psychedelic experience.

4292
01:56:36,090 --> 01:56:40,080
And it supports the idea that
when you take a psychedelic drug,

4293
01:56:40,110 --> 01:56:42,540
it's not simply that you are,

4294
01:56:42,660 --> 01:56:46,620
your brain is interacting with a chemical
because in reality that's all your

4295
01:56:46,621 --> 01:56:47,670
brain does all day.

4296
01:56:47,700 --> 01:56:49,110
It reacts to Stimuli.

4297
01:56:49,111 --> 01:56:50,490
Relapse reacts to love,

4298
01:56:50,491 --> 01:56:51,390
reacts to hate,

4299
01:56:51,510 --> 01:56:52,440
reacts to stress,

4300
01:56:52,441 --> 01:56:53,400
Cortisol levels,

4301
01:56:53,401 --> 01:56:54,120
adrenaline.

4302
01:56:54,120 --> 01:56:58,320
There's a constant soup of chemicals
that are influencing whether or not you

4303
01:56:58,321 --> 01:56:59,760
think one way or another,

4304
01:56:59,761 --> 01:57:01,080
whether or not you get excited,

4305
01:57:01,081 --> 01:57:02,340
whether or not you stay calm.

4306
01:57:02,670 --> 01:57:05,670
So the idea is that this one chemical,

4307
01:57:05,671 --> 01:57:10,671
which is produced by the human brain
and is so closely replicated by DMT,

4308
01:57:11,250 --> 01:57:14,220
by a Iowasca buy mushrooms,

4309
01:57:14,350 --> 01:57:19,260
like mushrooms are really similar in
like their chemical structure to DMT.

4310
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:19,951
So the,

4311
01:57:19,951 --> 01:57:24,220
the fact that mushrooms are really
similar to natural human neurochemistry is

4312
01:57:24,240 --> 01:57:25,320
pretty fucking freaky.

4313
01:57:25,650 --> 01:57:27,480
And the fact that when
you take these things,

4314
01:57:27,570 --> 01:57:28,580
you have these uh,

4315
01:57:28,610 --> 01:57:33,610
these weird interdimensional
hallucinations where
you feel like you'd go

4316
01:57:33,631 --> 01:57:34,170
somewhere.

4317
01:57:34,170 --> 01:57:34,591
I had a,

4318
01:57:34,591 --> 01:57:36,570
I had the weirdest thing
when I took mushrooms.

4319
01:57:36,571 --> 01:57:39,070
I took a three hour shower and I,

4320
01:57:39,071 --> 01:57:41,130
I kept seeing myself from the side.

4321
01:57:41,131 --> 01:57:42,360
Like I kept seeing my profile,

4322
01:57:42,361 --> 01:57:43,230
which was terrible.

4323
01:57:43,231 --> 01:57:43,780
I was like,

4324
01:57:43,780 --> 01:57:46,650
it was a terrible profile has to do is
think about that and it's disastrous

4325
01:57:46,651 --> 01:57:47,131
profile.

4326
01:57:47,131 --> 01:57:47,410
But I have,

4327
01:57:47,410 --> 01:57:47,920
I have,

4328
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:49,050
my chest is going in,

4329
01:57:49,051 --> 01:57:50,070
I got a barrel it out.

4330
01:57:50,100 --> 01:57:52,440
I got a lot of bench to do a,

4331
01:57:52,441 --> 01:57:55,680
and then I kept seeing somebody
in the corner with a whip,

4332
01:57:56,250 --> 01:57:59,610
like who was kind of telling
me to tell the truth.

4333
01:57:59,730 --> 01:58:00,091
You know,

4334
01:58:00,091 --> 01:58:00,990
what wasn't whipping me.

4335
01:58:00,991 --> 01:58:02,090
But [inaudible] is like this.

4336
01:58:02,130 --> 01:58:04,560
I kept feeling this presence of,

4337
01:58:04,561 --> 01:58:05,040
uh,

4338
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:07,440
this person with a whip saying,

4339
01:58:07,470 --> 01:58:07,800
you know,

4340
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:08,600
I think it was my,

4341
01:58:08,600 --> 01:58:08,980
my,

4342
01:58:08,980 --> 01:58:09,170
the,

4343
01:58:09,170 --> 01:58:12,450
the side of me that was
the truth and not lying.

4344
01:58:12,451 --> 01:58:12,631
You know,

4345
01:58:12,631 --> 01:58:14,250
I realize that a lot of my life was a lie.

4346
01:58:14,730 --> 01:58:15,563
Um,

4347
01:58:15,780 --> 01:58:16,470
cause I was young,

4348
01:58:16,470 --> 01:58:17,520
I was young trying to do,

4349
01:58:17,521 --> 01:58:18,540
I was living other people's lives.

4350
01:58:18,541 --> 01:58:18,790
So it was,

4351
01:58:18,790 --> 01:58:19,440
I was doing,

4352
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:21,300
listening to other
people and it was a very,

4353
01:58:21,301 --> 01:58:23,730
very profound trip in a sense.

4354
01:58:23,910 --> 01:58:24,743
And I actually,

4355
01:58:24,840 --> 01:58:25,620
uh,

4356
01:58:25,620 --> 01:58:28,230
af after I got back to normal,

4357
01:58:28,231 --> 01:58:29,550
the next day I had a,

4358
01:58:29,850 --> 01:58:31,830
I kind of did a real
reassessment of my life.

4359
01:58:31,831 --> 01:58:32,371
I have to say,

4360
01:58:32,371 --> 01:58:32,501
I,

4361
01:58:32,501 --> 01:58:33,360
I kind of was like,

4362
01:58:33,361 --> 01:58:34,020
I'm not going to be,

4363
01:58:34,020 --> 01:58:36,810
I'm going to do what I want to do
and listen to my own inner compass.

4364
01:58:36,811 --> 01:58:37,830
And I haven't been doing that.

4365
01:58:37,831 --> 01:58:38,140
Yeah.

4366
01:58:38,140 --> 01:58:39,850
Well you're very different
than when you were,

4367
01:58:39,851 --> 01:58:40,720
when I first met you.

4368
01:58:40,760 --> 01:58:41,890
You very different.

4369
01:58:42,130 --> 01:58:44,020
You're very different in your good.

4370
01:58:44,050 --> 01:58:44,681
Yes.

4371
01:58:44,681 --> 01:58:45,071
Much,

4372
01:58:45,071 --> 01:58:45,401
much,

4373
01:58:45,401 --> 01:58:46,120
much better.

4374
01:58:46,120 --> 01:58:47,320
And not that there's
anything wrong with you.

4375
01:58:47,321 --> 01:58:47,771
Back then,

4376
01:58:47,771 --> 01:58:48,370
you were awesome.

4377
01:58:48,370 --> 01:58:51,520
I'd so if I met you in 1994 today,

4378
01:58:51,521 --> 01:58:53,770
if I met the 1994 cal and I
would still be your best friend.

4379
01:58:54,010 --> 01:58:55,390
It's not that you were no,

4380
01:58:55,391 --> 01:58:57,790
but I know you were way more,

4381
01:58:57,840 --> 01:58:58,673
um,

4382
01:58:58,690 --> 01:59:00,550
under the control of other
people that are directed.

4383
01:59:00,790 --> 01:59:01,180
Yeah,

4384
01:59:01,180 --> 01:59:02,013
it was weird.

4385
01:59:02,200 --> 01:59:02,580
Like,

4386
01:59:02,580 --> 01:59:03,210
and I,

4387
01:59:03,210 --> 01:59:04,043
I've always been

4388
01:59:04,140 --> 01:59:05,830
that I had that luxury.

4389
01:59:05,831 --> 01:59:06,664
You didn't,

4390
01:59:06,740 --> 01:59:07,010
so,

4391
01:59:07,010 --> 01:59:08,470
so the world was a
dangerous place for you.

4392
01:59:08,471 --> 01:59:11,770
I had a lot of fall backs and I think it
allows you the luxury of not having to

4393
01:59:11,771 --> 01:59:12,491
think for yourself.

4394
01:59:12,491 --> 01:59:13,450
I think that one of the,

4395
01:59:13,451 --> 01:59:13,901
one of the,

4396
01:59:13,901 --> 01:59:14,710
um,

4397
01:59:14,710 --> 01:59:16,810
one of the fallbacks of having,

4398
01:59:16,811 --> 01:59:17,021
you know,

4399
01:59:17,021 --> 01:59:19,400
a supportive home structure is,

4400
01:59:19,570 --> 01:59:20,470
which is a good thing,

4401
01:59:20,830 --> 01:59:22,330
but you know,

4402
01:59:22,331 --> 01:59:24,760
when you have to fend for
yourself in a lot of ways.

4403
01:59:25,060 --> 01:59:26,020
And I did to an extent,

4404
01:59:26,021 --> 01:59:26,181
but,

4405
01:59:26,181 --> 01:59:27,014
but you know,

4406
01:59:27,980 --> 01:59:29,230
I always say to young people,

4407
01:59:29,231 --> 01:59:33,670
it's normal when you're young
to be overwhelmed by forces,

4408
01:59:33,671 --> 01:59:34,510
you can't explain.

4409
01:59:34,511 --> 01:59:38,830
It is a lot of mystery in the world and
you will be directed other other ways.

4410
01:59:39,070 --> 01:59:44,070
And your job as you get older is to
find out who you are and what you're

4411
01:59:44,621 --> 01:59:48,100
supposed to do and where you're supposed
to place your energy on your own terms.

4412
01:59:48,340 --> 01:59:50,380
That is the communion
you have with yourself,

4413
01:59:50,410 --> 01:59:51,370
that that is the,

4414
01:59:51,371 --> 01:59:52,300
that is the idea.

4415
01:59:52,301 --> 01:59:53,134
So that,

4416
01:59:53,470 --> 01:59:53,981
you know,

4417
01:59:53,981 --> 01:59:55,240
for me now at this age,

4418
01:59:55,260 --> 01:59:55,590
they do.

4419
01:59:55,590 --> 01:59:56,130
You're not going to,

4420
01:59:56,130 --> 01:59:56,831
you're not going to fool me.

4421
01:59:56,831 --> 01:59:57,461
There's no mystery.

4422
01:59:57,461 --> 01:59:57,941
I know,

4423
01:59:57,941 --> 01:59:59,230
I know to an extent,

4424
01:59:59,231 --> 02:00:00,070
there's a lot to learn,

4425
02:00:00,071 --> 02:00:02,710
but I know who I am.

4426
02:00:02,800 --> 02:00:05,500
I know what I'm supposed
to do and I know why.

4427
02:00:05,800 --> 02:00:07,820
And that's a nice place to come to that.

4428
02:00:07,830 --> 02:00:09,730
It's one of the reasons
I love standup so much,

4429
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:10,300
by the way.

4430
02:00:10,300 --> 02:00:12,400
It's kind of one of the things
that I think is wonderful.

4431
02:00:12,420 --> 02:00:13,660
It's a privilege I feel,

4432
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:17,140
cause I get to express
myself in an original way.

4433
02:00:17,290 --> 02:00:18,370
And that never,

4434
02:00:18,371 --> 02:00:22,240
that challenge never goes
away and it's always changing.

4435
02:00:22,241 --> 02:00:25,390
It's one of the things that you know
is fun like you and I go do the road.

4436
02:00:25,420 --> 02:00:27,040
One of the bonding experience.

4437
02:00:27,041 --> 02:00:30,940
I know you feel the same way as when you
want your friend growing as an artist

4438
02:00:31,090 --> 02:00:35,580
growing in his self expression
and constantly changing
and having to change and,

4439
02:00:35,590 --> 02:00:35,841
and,

4440
02:00:35,841 --> 02:00:39,760
and being relevant to whatever's
going on it with you at the time

4441
02:00:39,960 --> 02:00:44,490
and having the ability to be a generous,

4442
02:00:44,580 --> 02:00:45,480
loving,

4443
02:00:45,690 --> 02:00:47,610
open pals.

4444
02:00:47,820 --> 02:00:52,170
Were you not worried about the other
people getting success competition?

4445
02:00:52,171 --> 02:00:55,980
There's a lot of that in the artistic
communities and whether it's music or

4446
02:00:55,981 --> 02:00:56,850
whether it's comedy,

4447
02:00:56,851 --> 02:01:00,480
there's a lot of that and I think one of
the best things that we've ever done is

4448
02:01:00,481 --> 02:01:03,060
sort of eliminate that from
our entire group of people.

4449
02:01:03,330 --> 02:01:05,400
Like we have an amazing group of people,

4450
02:01:05,401 --> 02:01:09,780
whether it's already or Joey or Dunkin
or red band or all these people that were

4451
02:01:09,781 --> 02:01:13,190
hanging around with that are
up there and they're there.

4452
02:01:13,191 --> 02:01:16,740
They're doing things like we
are all having fun together,

4453
02:01:16,760 --> 02:01:16,960
right?

4454
02:01:16,960 --> 02:01:17,160
Like,

4455
02:01:17,160 --> 02:01:18,330
no one is like,

4456
02:01:18,331 --> 02:01:18,650
you know,

4457
02:01:18,650 --> 02:01:20,220
he brings their own talent to the stage.

4458
02:01:20,221 --> 02:01:22,410
Thompson Thompson girl was brilliant man.

4459
02:01:22,420 --> 02:01:22,651
You know,

4460
02:01:22,651 --> 02:01:22,861
there's,

4461
02:01:22,861 --> 02:01:23,610
there's so many,

4462
02:01:23,610 --> 02:01:27,550
there's so many good guys now and to
have all the Hinchcliffe Tony Hinchcliffe

4463
02:01:27,551 --> 02:01:28,291
so hilarious guy.

4464
02:01:28,291 --> 02:01:29,960
I worked with him Sunday night at uh,

4465
02:01:30,300 --> 02:01:30,811
Ontario.

4466
02:01:30,811 --> 02:01:31,890
He's fucking hilarious.

4467
02:01:32,370 --> 02:01:33,810
He's constantly working to,

4468
02:01:33,811 --> 02:01:38,430
these guys are constantly working with
growing and when you have like a group

4469
02:01:38,431 --> 02:01:39,000
like that,

4470
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:39,160
they,

4471
02:01:39,160 --> 02:01:40,490
like everybody inside

4472
02:01:40,490 --> 02:01:41,570
grows everybody.

4473
02:01:41,960 --> 02:01:43,480
Everybody's at Synnex city.

4474
02:01:43,490 --> 02:01:44,660
It's not like there's a pie.

4475
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:45,890
You have the bigger piece.

4476
02:01:45,891 --> 02:01:46,880
There's no scarcity.

4477
02:01:46,881 --> 02:01:48,310
That's where people I think fallen the,

4478
02:01:48,320 --> 02:01:50,480
into trouble where they think of the,

4479
02:01:50,481 --> 02:01:52,720
of the world as a Pi
and he's got this much,

4480
02:01:52,721 --> 02:01:53,660
that means I don't have as much.

4481
02:01:53,690 --> 02:01:54,460
It's not true at all.

4482
02:01:54,460 --> 02:01:55,610
It's a great point.

4483
02:01:55,790 --> 02:01:56,660
That's a great point.

4484
02:01:56,661 --> 02:01:56,961
And that you're,

4485
02:01:56,961 --> 02:01:59,120
that you're one of the
best at describing that,

4486
02:01:59,150 --> 02:01:59,450
that,

4487
02:01:59,450 --> 02:01:59,780
that,

4488
02:01:59,780 --> 02:02:02,780
that mindset and you've
never had that mindset.

4489
02:02:02,870 --> 02:02:03,970
It's one of the reasons why B,

4490
02:02:03,980 --> 02:02:06,020
we've been good friends
from the moment that we met.

4491
02:02:06,310 --> 02:02:06,650
I just,

4492
02:02:06,650 --> 02:02:07,341
I knew there's,

4493
02:02:07,341 --> 02:02:08,290
you don't have any Duchenne.

4494
02:02:08,320 --> 02:02:08,640
You No,

4495
02:02:08,640 --> 02:02:08,711
no,

4496
02:02:08,711 --> 02:02:08,870
no.

4497
02:02:08,870 --> 02:02:10,730
Because I look at it as an inspiration.

4498
02:02:11,010 --> 02:02:11,960
So if I see a friend of mine,

4499
02:02:11,961 --> 02:02:13,070
it becomes very successful.

4500
02:02:13,460 --> 02:02:13,761
You know,

4501
02:02:13,761 --> 02:02:14,410
when I watch,

4502
02:02:14,410 --> 02:02:15,200
uh,

4503
02:02:15,200 --> 02:02:16,160
what the success you've,

4504
02:02:16,220 --> 02:02:17,480
you've created for yourself.

4505
02:02:17,510 --> 02:02:19,400
To me it's very inspirational.

4506
02:02:19,401 --> 02:02:23,480
I that jealousy doesn't ever play a
role in it and jealousy is in fact is a

4507
02:02:23,481 --> 02:02:24,350
false emotion.

4508
02:02:24,351 --> 02:02:24,890
And you,

4509
02:02:24,890 --> 02:02:25,701
you can have it.

4510
02:02:25,701 --> 02:02:26,331
We all have,

4511
02:02:26,331 --> 02:02:29,990
we all want something that you would get
worried about your own accomplishment.

4512
02:02:29,991 --> 02:02:31,400
When you see somebody being really good,

4513
02:02:31,401 --> 02:02:31,611
you're like,

4514
02:02:31,611 --> 02:02:31,761
oh,

4515
02:02:31,761 --> 02:02:32,600
I'm being lazy.

4516
02:02:32,780 --> 02:02:35,570
But just you got to approach
that energy in a different way,

4517
02:02:35,571 --> 02:02:35,870
right?

4518
02:02:35,870 --> 02:02:37,850
That energy is going
to be there no problem.

4519
02:02:38,510 --> 02:02:39,770
And you could also be,

4520
02:02:39,771 --> 02:02:40,400
it's a good thing.

4521
02:02:40,400 --> 02:02:40,820
Yes,

4522
02:02:40,820 --> 02:02:41,450
it is a good thing.

4523
02:02:41,450 --> 02:02:43,400
You could look at yourself unfavorably,

4524
02:02:43,401 --> 02:02:43,671
you know,

4525
02:02:43,671 --> 02:02:44,480
and that's where the gel is.

4526
02:02:44,480 --> 02:02:45,590
Don't let the energy,

4527
02:02:45,591 --> 02:02:46,820
don't let that energy.

4528
02:02:46,970 --> 02:02:48,650
Don't let that energy say fuck that guy.

4529
02:02:48,651 --> 02:02:49,221
He's just lucky.

4530
02:02:49,221 --> 02:02:50,570
He's just good at playing politics.

4531
02:02:50,630 --> 02:02:51,500
Never helps you.

4532
02:02:51,680 --> 02:02:52,341
And it's a lot.

4533
02:02:52,341 --> 02:02:52,520
Yes,

4534
02:02:52,520 --> 02:02:53,210
it is a lie.

4535
02:02:53,210 --> 02:02:54,470
And even if it isn't a lie,

4536
02:02:54,540 --> 02:02:56,050
who cares what Catherine to do with you?

4537
02:02:56,090 --> 02:02:56,630
Who Cares?

4538
02:02:56,630 --> 02:03:00,560
If you see a guy and that guy hit the
lottery and got on a TV show and you know

4539
02:03:00,561 --> 02:03:02,270
it was like friends or
something like that,

4540
02:03:02,340 --> 02:03:02,811
not friends,

4541
02:03:02,811 --> 02:03:05,810
but you know one of those kind of shows
and then all of a sudden he's doing

4542
02:03:05,910 --> 02:03:08,210
headlining clubs and he really
shouldn't be on stage at all.

4543
02:03:08,360 --> 02:03:09,570
What do you give a fuck cares?

4544
02:03:09,571 --> 02:03:10,131
Who Cares?

4545
02:03:10,131 --> 02:03:10,430
You know?

4546
02:03:10,430 --> 02:03:10,820
You know what?

4547
02:03:10,820 --> 02:03:13,220
You know what happens to me if I
see somebody who's really good?

4548
02:03:13,221 --> 02:03:13,521
First of all,

4549
02:03:13,521 --> 02:03:16,910
I spend my time with people that are
good and I watched my friend kicking ass

4550
02:03:16,911 --> 02:03:17,091
like,

4551
02:03:17,091 --> 02:03:18,500
you are sick or something like that.

4552
02:03:19,010 --> 02:03:20,510
I get so pumped.

4553
02:03:20,720 --> 02:03:21,560
It just says,

4554
02:03:21,740 --> 02:03:22,430
it says to me,

4555
02:03:22,430 --> 02:03:24,260
I feel like I'm in the right company.

4556
02:03:24,261 --> 02:03:27,110
These people are inspiring
me to move forward and keep.

4557
02:03:27,170 --> 02:03:28,790
I want to see what I'm capable of.

4558
02:03:29,630 --> 02:03:34,400
Discovery and invention is what
separates human beings from animals.

4559
02:03:34,940 --> 02:03:35,840
As a creator,

4560
02:03:35,890 --> 02:03:36,620
you know you are.

4561
02:03:36,620 --> 02:03:39,080
The beautiful thing about your act
is that you're creating something.

4562
02:03:39,081 --> 02:03:40,850
What I always said to
you when I first met you,

4563
02:03:40,851 --> 02:03:41,420
I was like,

4564
02:03:41,420 --> 02:03:43,870
why are you not like putting
more emphasis into your standing?

4565
02:03:43,880 --> 02:03:44,630
I'm like,

4566
02:03:44,630 --> 02:03:45,141
first of all,

4567
02:03:45,141 --> 02:03:47,120
you're trying to do what
these guys want you to do.

4568
02:03:47,121 --> 02:03:48,650
You're doing this weird alternative thing.

4569
02:03:48,651 --> 02:03:51,000
We were being like real
like unthreatening on stage.

4570
02:03:51,370 --> 02:03:52,430
You weren't being yourself.

4571
02:03:52,431 --> 02:03:52,761
And I was like,

4572
02:03:52,761 --> 02:03:53,594
this is weird.

4573
02:03:53,630 --> 02:03:58,630
And then you're always
constantly politicking for
your next Gig and your primary

4574
02:03:58,761 --> 02:03:59,031
Gig.

4575
02:03:59,031 --> 02:04:00,890
Like you were looking for the
primary Gig and I was like,

4576
02:04:00,891 --> 02:04:01,400
Jesus Christ,

4577
02:04:01,400 --> 02:04:02,570
your primary gigs right here,

4578
02:04:02,680 --> 02:04:03,800
standing on the acting.

4579
02:04:03,980 --> 02:04:05,780
You didn't do comedy for a long time.

4580
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:06,673
Eight years.

4581
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:08,630
That is so fucking crazy to me.

4582
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:09,650
It's so crazy.

4583
02:04:09,650 --> 02:04:10,770
We were friends during that time.

4584
02:04:10,771 --> 02:04:11,030
No,

4585
02:04:11,030 --> 02:04:11,890
I never did standup.

4586
02:04:11,900 --> 02:04:12,770
I didn't just do it.

4587
02:04:12,800 --> 02:04:13,251
Send them again.

4588
02:04:13,251 --> 02:04:14,450
So it was like 36 or so.

4589
02:04:14,451 --> 02:04:15,860
It's so weird to me,

4590
02:04:15,861 --> 02:04:16,250
man,

4591
02:04:16,250 --> 02:04:17,750
because you were always so funny.

4592
02:04:18,340 --> 02:04:18,651
You know?

4593
02:04:18,651 --> 02:04:19,490
Now what I see,

4594
02:04:19,491 --> 02:04:20,240
you know,

4595
02:04:20,240 --> 02:04:21,110
and then I'm just,

4596
02:04:21,190 --> 02:04:21,310
uh,

4597
02:04:21,310 --> 02:04:23,330
you know about to shoot
my second hour here.

4598
02:04:23,331 --> 02:04:23,631
It's just,

4599
02:04:23,631 --> 02:04:23,811
it's,

4600
02:04:23,811 --> 02:04:24,830
and things start to Gel.

4601
02:04:24,831 --> 02:04:28,730
I can't believe I spent so much time
not doing it and can't imagine my life.

4602
02:04:28,850 --> 02:04:30,050
You need to listen to me more bitch.

4603
02:04:30,110 --> 02:04:30,810
I know.

4604
02:04:30,810 --> 02:04:30,951
I,

4605
02:04:30,951 --> 02:04:31,491
by the way,

4606
02:04:31,491 --> 02:04:32,061
I'll tell you what,

4607
02:04:32,061 --> 02:04:32,990
I'll be in Houston.

4608
02:04:33,200 --> 02:04:35,180
I'll be in Houston Improv then Buffalo,

4609
02:04:35,460 --> 02:04:35,670
uh,

4610
02:04:35,670 --> 02:04:36,620
and then Calgary.

4611
02:04:36,650 --> 02:04:37,560
I'm all over the place.

4612
02:04:37,561 --> 02:04:38,070
Go to Brian

4613
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:39,870
cowen.com and you'll see,

4614
02:04:39,871 --> 02:04:41,010
you'll see my schedule.

4615
02:04:41,100 --> 02:04:42,060
You'll see my schedule.

4616
02:04:42,090 --> 02:04:42,923
You're like,

4617
02:04:43,080 --> 02:04:44,520
you're doing some really funny,

4618
02:04:44,521 --> 02:04:46,050
weird shit on stage right now.

4619
02:04:46,051 --> 02:04:46,710
Mass party.

4620
02:04:46,710 --> 02:04:47,970
You're hitting your stride,

4621
02:04:48,060 --> 02:04:48,210
right?

4622
02:04:48,210 --> 02:04:49,950
If you can tell you've
been doing all these sets,

4623
02:04:50,310 --> 02:04:51,450
that's really what it's all about.

4624
02:04:51,600 --> 02:04:51,740
Yeah.

4625
02:04:51,740 --> 02:04:53,070
That's one of the things about um,

4626
02:04:53,100 --> 02:04:55,290
doing clubs as opposed to doing theaters.

4627
02:04:55,650 --> 02:04:58,470
I'm liking doing five sets in a weekend.

4628
02:04:58,550 --> 02:04:59,383
All right.

4629
02:05:00,090 --> 02:05:02,010
Once you get in comedy shaped though,

4630
02:05:02,011 --> 02:05:03,330
you got to get in comedy shape.

4631
02:05:03,331 --> 02:05:08,331
You've got to get used to doing those
long sets in because it's so crucial.

4632
02:05:08,730 --> 02:05:08,970
Yeah.

4633
02:05:08,970 --> 02:05:10,530
Because you've got to be really like,

4634
02:05:10,531 --> 02:05:12,390
especially with second
shows like second show,

4635
02:05:12,391 --> 02:05:13,224
Saturday night,

4636
02:05:13,350 --> 02:05:16,980
you gotta be real careful on your set
list because you can get lost in what

4637
02:05:16,981 --> 02:05:19,950
you've done and haven't done cause
it shows start merging together.

4638
02:05:19,951 --> 02:05:22,710
They start like they
start becoming one show.

4639
02:05:22,770 --> 02:05:23,640
It's real weird.

4640
02:05:23,670 --> 02:05:24,330
Yup.

4641
02:05:24,330 --> 02:05:27,380
I have got to run to go do the
fighter and the kid podcast.

4642
02:05:27,630 --> 02:05:28,830
I've got to do another podcast.

4643
02:05:28,831 --> 02:05:29,390
And if I don't,

4644
02:05:29,390 --> 02:05:32,280
that's granite shop will take a big
warm hand in my face and I don't want to

4645
02:05:32,281 --> 02:05:32,730
deal with that.

4646
02:05:32,730 --> 02:05:35,070
Don't let them do that because
I have to be there by three 30.

4647
02:05:35,071 --> 02:05:36,450
You'll forgive me quite large hands.

4648
02:05:36,451 --> 02:05:36,780
Yeah.

4649
02:05:36,780 --> 02:05:37,340
Let's end this,

4650
02:05:37,340 --> 02:05:37,710
um,

4651
02:05:37,710 --> 02:05:38,670
Houston Improv.

4652
02:05:38,700 --> 02:05:40,770
Brian Callan is available this weekend.

4653
02:05:40,771 --> 02:05:41,604
You freaks.

4654
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:42,151
So,

4655
02:05:42,151 --> 02:05:42,660
uh,

4656
02:05:42,660 --> 02:05:46,200
let the free party rollout to the Houston
Improv and support and I guarantee

4657
02:05:46,201 --> 02:05:46,321

4658
02:05:46,321 --> 02:05:47,430
you will laugh your dick off.

4659
02:05:47,760 --> 02:05:50,670
I have a told people about you for many,

4660
02:05:50,671 --> 02:05:51,570
many years of course.

4661
02:05:51,571 --> 02:05:52,230
But um,

4662
02:05:52,230 --> 02:05:55,500
lately on Twitter I've been getting a
lot of tweets of people that went to your

4663
02:05:55,501 --> 02:05:57,420
show and had a fucking blast.

4664
02:05:57,421 --> 02:05:57,871
Thanks buddy.

4665
02:05:57,871 --> 02:05:58,201
So,

4666
02:05:58,201 --> 02:05:58,670
uh,

4667
02:05:58,670 --> 02:05:59,021
and we're,

4668
02:05:59,021 --> 02:06:00,210
we're going to schedule some dates.

4669
02:06:00,240 --> 02:06:01,410
We're going to do some yes,

4670
02:06:01,411 --> 02:06:02,131
we are future too.

4671
02:06:02,131 --> 02:06:02,820
Like we just did.

4672
02:06:02,820 --> 02:06:03,410
Yes.

4673
02:06:03,410 --> 02:06:04,243
Ryan and I A,

4674
02:06:04,320 --> 02:06:07,470
we've worked together a couple
times now Vegas and we're so stupid.

4675
02:06:07,471 --> 02:06:07,701
We,

4676
02:06:07,701 --> 02:06:08,850
why did we wait this long?

4677
02:06:08,880 --> 02:06:09,031
Why?

4678
02:06:09,031 --> 02:06:10,590
It's only done total blast.

4679
02:06:10,620 --> 02:06:11,281
Let's go.

4680
02:06:11,281 --> 02:06:13,860
And why did we wait this dark
at like three in the morning?

4681
02:06:13,861 --> 02:06:14,461
It was amazing.
