1
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,290
Yeah,

2
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,130
I'm here with my brother,
Daniella,

3
00:00:19,131 --> 00:00:24,131
but lily,
one of the few men who can pull off a 

4
00:00:24,131 --> 00:00:26,540
union gang Bandana,
like some renegade bike or on an episode

5
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:28,880
of Grey's anatomy.
Look at that fucking thing,

6
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:35,150
but you,
you fucking balance it out with a Frank 

7
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:35,150
Frazetta,
Conan the barbarian tee shirt.

8
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,790
That shirt is the shit.
Where'd you pick that up?

9
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,140
Oh Man.
I was looking all over the place for it.

10
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:46,560
They probably had it for like some of 
the comic book store Milione are sickle 

11
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,311
and I thought that was a dope shirt.
I might have to hide that one for my 

12
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:50,450
wife because she probably tried to throw
it out.

13
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:51,890
Why?
I don't know.

14
00:00:51,891 --> 00:00:54,020
You know women are men.
Come on.

15
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,030
This contains Saturday decent.
That's good in life.

16
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:01,060
Maybe it's time to grow up.
Maybe you shouldn't have a comic book 

17
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:01,190
guy and your shirt.
It's not a fucking comic book.

18
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,750
It's an.
It's a novel.

19
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,600
Robert e Dot Howard wrote a series of 
novels.

20
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,870
It's about Conan the barbarian.
People don't know.

21
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,970
It's like my entire life philosophy is 
based off of our barrier like galaxies 

22
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:18,610
called mentoree.
You can get in trouble for that kind of 

23
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:18,610
philosophy.

24
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,840
Crombs a good God could obviously solid 
because he doesn't give a fuck of here 

25
00:01:25,011 --> 00:01:26,060
to help you.
Nope.

26
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:29,320
Not going to save you.
That's the beauty of the color.

27
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:30,590
It's very real.
You know,

28
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:31,280
it's like,
Hey,

29
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,880
life is tough deal to fuck with it 
because that's the way it's going to be.

30
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,700
Yet there are horrible things that can 
happen.

31
00:01:37,701 --> 00:01:39,950
Yet there's no guarantees about the 
afterlife.

32
00:01:39,951 --> 00:01:40,940
Yeah,
all of that.

33
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:42,860
But in the meantime,
there are women.

34
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,140
There's red wine,
there's enemies to be killed,

35
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,620
or Marty wants probably parasites,
all sorts of weird diseases.

36
00:01:48,621 --> 00:01:52,990
Nobody's ever diagnosed yet that parties
did last year as I feel you're lucky you

37
00:01:52,991 --> 00:01:57,991
live to 30.
It's kind of amazing when they keep 

38
00:01:57,991 --> 00:01:58,900
finding these new species of people,
you know,

39
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,660
there was,
um,

40
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:04,690
they've just,
they had this article yesterday where 

41
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:04,690
they're,
they've examined the teeth,

42
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,310
the teeth of the Hobbit,
people on the island of Flores.

43
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,430
And so now they're like,
you know,

44
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,080
99 point nine percent positive.
It's 100 percent,

45
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,140
not 99 point nine percent positive.
One hundred percent,

46
00:02:15,141 --> 00:02:20,141
but 99 point nine percent positive that 
it's a completely different species of 

47
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:22,970
human being.
They found the teeth of these things and

48
00:02:22,971 --> 00:02:26,480
you've got to think like that's the only
like 14,000

49
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:27,780
years ago,
you know,

50
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,290
and we don't even remember those things.
They're there.

51
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,440
They've sort of become like this weird 
little legend,

52
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:38,650
like how many different versions of 
people were out there and what a hard 

53
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,000
scrabble life it must have been extinct.
Shootings,

54
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,960
the name of the game.
I mean,

55
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:46,961
when you think about it,
like overwhelming majority of pieces 

56
00:02:46,961 --> 00:02:46,961
that I've ever been around.
They've all gone extent.

57
00:02:46,961 --> 00:02:48,200
Yeah.
More than 90 percent,

58
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:48,560
right?
Yep.

59
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,150
So it's uh,
yeah,

60
00:02:50,151 --> 00:02:51,860
it's uh,
that's my point.

61
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,340
Calling on the throats,
you know,

62
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,770
with,
with bear claws,

63
00:02:54,771 --> 00:02:55,610
runs neck.

64
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,270
That's a fucking awesome picture.
Yeah.

65
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,250
That's why I it in my house as a 
pollster,

66
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,360
I might have to be obsessed.
I have a bunch of his old books for 

67
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,711
Zetas,
old books like sketch books and books 

68
00:03:10,711 --> 00:03:10,711
that are collections of his paintings.
And God,

69
00:03:10,711 --> 00:03:14,290
that kind of art that he did was just so
indicative of that time.

70
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:19,291
It was like so 19 seventies fantasy art,
you know those days,

71
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:21,940
man,
you know,

72
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:24,820
but no one has really captured it 
correctly in a movie.

73
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,430
They just have not done it right.
You didn't,

74
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:31,270
you didn't think of.
The first one was fun and it was campy,

75
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,720
but it was more like the comic book.
Then it was like the books.

76
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:40,050
I think Jason Mamoa was the best version
of cone and physically he looked just 

77
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:43,600
the beginning that it was dog shit.
Shameful.

78
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,700
Their movie was dog shit.

79
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,030
That guy is awesome.
I love that.

80
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:50,380
Jason Mamoa.
He's great.

81
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,520
In game of thrones.
He was.

82
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,930
He seemed like the most likely Conan 
might have to get them on the Jews 

83
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,291
though.
I know there's that to get them on some 

84
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:04,771
fucking heavy duty powerlifting program 
where he has to look a little more yoked

85
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,200
because Conan was just supposedly 
ridiculously impressive as a person.

86
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,600
I knew in fact,
when they put power and old as the first

87
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:18,601
one that's kind of high.
That sets the bar pretty high right 

88
00:04:18,601 --> 00:04:18,601
away.
But.

89
00:04:18,601 --> 00:04:23,130
But Arnold was built incorrectly.
He had all these unnecessary like big 

90
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,360
titty muscles,
like you know,

91
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,330
you need a guy who's built more like 
Yoel Romero,

92
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,420
like a,
like a barbarian Yoel Romero.

93
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:36,460
The sword was me just to say that.
But you're here and I want you to feel 

94
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:39,730
embarrassed.
It's okay.

95
00:04:39,731 --> 00:04:41,660
It's okay.
I can accept limits.

96
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,290
It's fine.
So tell me about your book man.

97
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,240
Not Afraid,
uh,

98
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:47,590
on fear,
heartbreak,

99
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:52,020
raising a baby girl and cage fighting.
That's an unusual combination of things.

100
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,430
That's what makes it interesting.
No,

101
00:04:54,431 --> 00:04:56,210
I mean,
to me these was um,

102
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,980
oldest stuff I've written so far.
What's going to have more Fritos,

103
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,010
Alfie,
cutting nature,

104
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,360
DC's a bit more personal.
These is very much um,

105
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:09,450
my life.
It's sort of divided up into three 

106
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,911
parts.
The first part is about dealing with 

107
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:13,120
Fiori martial arts and he's kind of like
my experience.

108
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:16,750
Self stumps with the testing.
The boundaries are getting crashed.

109
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:21,780
Try again to find a way to make a deal 
with the skating feeling of when you 

110
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,120
have somebody coming in at you always 
been training for the last few years and

111
00:05:25,121 --> 00:05:26,470
wants to take your head off and you're 
like,

112
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,240
shit,
this is a little intimidating.

113
00:05:28,241 --> 00:05:30,060
There's all the pressure of people 
watching you.

114
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,330
The idea of getting fees if you fuck up 
and getting fuzzy,

115
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,280
cuddly dominated by another man,
which is never a fun feeling.

116
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,370
That kind of shift and so that's that 
part.

117
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:44,260
But then to me that fire just serves as 
a spring board for the other stuff which

118
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:49,261
is about.
That's good age when you are on the 

119
00:05:49,261 --> 00:05:49,261
match when you're in the cage for that 
stuff.

120
00:05:49,261 --> 00:05:50,240
But what about the rest of life and in 
this case,

121
00:05:50,241 --> 00:05:55,241
you know,
part tool deals with what happened with 

122
00:05:55,241 --> 00:05:55,241
my wife,
you know Betty Quique,

123
00:05:55,241 --> 00:05:57,380
a guy,
all of a southern.

124
00:05:57,381 --> 00:05:58,130
What the fuck is going

125
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:03,130
on in your bodies are falling apart,
diagnosed with brain tumor that within 

126
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,660
six months from the time the first scene
Don came up.

127
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:08,310
So it was really quick,
really harsh.

128
00:06:08,311 --> 00:06:13,010
When will the stuff that you may imagine
with debts and then the power three sort

129
00:06:13,011 --> 00:06:13,790
of,
okay,

130
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:18,791
now what you know,
what do I do with it now and life 

131
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:21,170
afterwards when when my wife died,
my daughter was 19 months old,

132
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:26,171
the old,
this shit was happening as you might 

133
00:06:26,171 --> 00:06:28,391
imagine,
and so it's like in some way that the 

134
00:06:28,391 --> 00:06:31,770
story elements kind of go together is 
like the martial art part was circled 

135
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:35,281
for water mop in terms of learning some 
things that then I would have to apply 

136
00:06:35,281 --> 00:06:39,971
on a much bigger,
more important scale in day to day life 

137
00:06:39,971 --> 00:06:43,630
and then you know,
when shit hits the fan and then 

138
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,380
afterwards would.
That changes my attitude about sayings,

139
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,570
my life overall and,
and you know,

140
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,120
when I was talking with publishers or 
regionality,

141
00:06:50,121 --> 00:06:55,121
they wanted a nice pretty arch or you 
start out as the scared we wimp and then

142
00:06:55,221 --> 00:06:57,780
you discover the secrets and then you'll
come back and Yardi,

143
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,320
fearless guy will go through life 
without fear.

144
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,780
And that's bullshit.
I mean it's.

145
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:05,000
I like to sell it that way.
That would sound cool,

146
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,960
but I'm not in the business of bullshit 
in my saddle for anybody else.

147
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:13,030
So I'm like,
it's not the seven steps to get rid of.

148
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,110
Fear is not that stuff.
It's a,

149
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,260
to me,
my experience self dealing with fear,

150
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,880
he's a fucking constant battle.
You know,

151
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,770
it's like you wake up a,
um,

152
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,180
you woke up one day and maybe you will 
learn to deal with it.

153
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,540
The zero point zero one percent better 
and that's a win and that the next day a

154
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,470
tto again,
and you have to deal with it again.

155
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,070
Like for me in particular,
what afterwards,

156
00:07:37,071 --> 00:07:40,680
what happened is the reality of 
realizing that everything is fleeting.

157
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:45,710
Everything can be taken away from you.
Everything you care about can go in the 

158
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,350
snap of a finger.
That really freaked me out.

159
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:52,070
You know that I use one thing to know it
intellectually is one thing when it hits

160
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,890
home for real.
And so once in a while,

161
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,780
you know,
I left my days when I'm totally fine,

162
00:07:56,781 --> 00:07:58,010
I feel strong,
I feel great,

163
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:02,480
and then all of a sudden will hit me 
when the thought of men,

164
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:05,350
everybody I love will die.
There's,

165
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:08,330
I've limited control of what's going to 
happen in my life.

166
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:12,800
Everything I care about can be taken 
away from me in a second shift.

167
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:17,830
Welcome to your day.
Now deal with the next 24 hours is like 

168
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,340
savvy.
And so dealing with that aspect,

169
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:22,340
finding ways to and you know,
and then I find a way to do it.

170
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,310
And then a month later we'll hit you 
again.

171
00:08:25,311 --> 00:08:28,740
And maybe because you found a way to do 
it before he actually delay.

172
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,950
But don't you think that's everybody?
There's no one.

173
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:36,360
This is a false narrative that someone's
figured out how to get rid of fear.

174
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,820
It doesn't exist.
If you have no fear,

175
00:08:38,821 --> 00:08:43,110
that means that you're not experiencing 
any danger or anything unknown.

176
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,410
And somehow or another you're a mortal.
Yep.

177
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,450
Because if you think about the 
consequences of death,

178
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:53,490
you're going to get nervous.
You're going to get afraid if you're 

179
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:53,790
taking any sort of risks or chances,
you're going to get nervous.

180
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's part of being a person.
Part of it's part of what's fun about 

181
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,390
getting things done in,
in succeeding is knowing all the mental 

182
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,650
roadblocks that are in place to keep you
from being successful big time,

183
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:08,460
and that's the way today.
They affect everybody.

184
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,960
So to me,
this is just,

185
00:09:09,961 --> 00:09:10,260
you know,
these,

186
00:09:10,261 --> 00:09:11,250
these,
my experience,

187
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:16,251
but he's like,
it's not that I have any illusion that 

188
00:09:16,251 --> 00:09:16,251
a,
I'm fighting battles that are unknown to

189
00:09:16,251 --> 00:09:19,110
other people because the reality is that
everybody has shit to deal with.

190
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:23,220
Know every body has horrible things 
happen to them.

191
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:27,150
Every body and you know,
horrible may Vadie for one person to the

192
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:32,151
next.
You may be slightly luckier than the 

193
00:09:32,151 --> 00:09:34,431
next guy,
but the reality is that everybody deal 

194
00:09:34,431 --> 00:09:36,231
with it.
So the question of how do you deal with 

195
00:09:36,231 --> 00:09:38,901
it?
What are the things that I help you get 

196
00:09:38,901 --> 00:09:41,580
the job done and which ones?
That's one of the great things about 

197
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,021
martial arts,
the dealing with the fear and the 

198
00:09:45,021 --> 00:09:47,990
pressure and stress of training.
It helps mitigate some of the pressures 

199
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,710
and stresses of everyday life.
That's.

200
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,820
That's exactly.
That's why,

201
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:54,870
you know,
when I went to some publishers 

202
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:54,870
initially,
they were like,

203
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:54,870
ah,
you know,

204
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:54,870
the,
your wife life.

205
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,640
After we got that part about what the 
fact is,

206
00:09:56,641 --> 00:09:58,140
martial art I've had to do with data.
I'm like,

207
00:09:58,141 --> 00:09:59,620
and it says everything to do with it,
you know,

208
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,450
because those are the same dynamics,
but I get to train them in a safe space,

209
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06,600
know martial art contest and then you 
apply them to the real game.

210
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,600
I'm the big girl scaling.
It's a controlled space and in terms of 

211
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,460
it's going to happen at 8:30
on Tuesday nights.

212
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,220
You get in there,
you know,

213
00:10:14,221 --> 00:10:16,790
it's like you can prepare for you eat 
for you,

214
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,610
make sure you have your meal is digested
in your stomach before you get there.

215
00:10:20,611 --> 00:10:22,470
You have a cup of coffee before you get 
to the gym.

216
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:27,770
You stretch out,
you prepare yourself and then you go 

217
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:27,770
through it.
But,

218
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:27,930
but in doing that it,
it definitely helps.

219
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:28,700
You know,
I've,

220
00:10:28,701 --> 00:10:33,150
I've had so many twitter messages and 
facebook messages and people that I meet

221
00:10:33,151 --> 00:10:38,151
after shows that told me that they 
started Jujitsu after listening to this 

222
00:10:38,151 --> 00:10:40,320
podcast and it changed their life and 
that it helps them so much and deal with

223
00:10:40,321 --> 00:10:44,970
pressure and now in pursuing a health,
a healthy lifestyle.

224
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:49,530
Like even guys like Anthony Bourdain who
was in his fifties,

225
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,960
I believe he was 58 when he started 
Jujitsu,

226
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,040
the eight,
58,

227
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,360
57 or 58.

228
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,420
Um,
he was a lifetime smoker.

229
00:10:57,421 --> 00:11:02,421
Heroin user,
I'm like pretty much like abused 

230
00:11:02,421 --> 00:11:03,270
everything.
Alcohol,

231
00:11:03,271 --> 00:11:07,800
everything now is way more healthy.
He's off.

232
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,910
I talked to them off statens off of high
blood pressure medication,

233
00:11:11,911 --> 00:11:15,420
lost 30 pounds just from training,
eats healthy,

234
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,950
still likes to party it up a little bit.
A little bows on.

235
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,720
But I'm,
the guy looks great.

236
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,960
He looks great and he's obsessed with 
Jujitsu and he loves it and it's sort of

237
00:11:24,961 --> 00:11:26,330
transformed his life.
You know,

238
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,870
his wife is a phenom.
Yeah.

239
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:31,290
So I saw she's a beast.
She trains every day.

240
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,550
I mean,
she's essentially,

241
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,170
I mean she's,
that's her life.

242
00:11:34,171 --> 00:11:36,460
Her life was training.
She loves him and uh,

243
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,110
it just got them,
it got them.

244
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:41,640
She said that she talked him into doing 
it by promising him narcotics,

245
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,880
which is one of the most hilarious 
stories ever.

246
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,740
She said like,
if you,

247
00:11:46,741 --> 00:11:48,690
if you come to train with me,
I'll give you some vicodin.

248
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:54,040
I'm in Nice.
Well he's the one of the few guys

249
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:59,250
that has been like a self professed 
junkie but was not only able to kick it,

250
00:11:59,711 --> 00:12:01,650
but you know,
still get high,

251
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:04,150
still drink and obviously doesn't have a
problem.

252
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,700
It's very healthy.
It doesn't do anything when he's at home

253
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:11,910
and you know,
when he's on the road in filming a show 

254
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:11,910
and the fillings done and he'll,
you know,

255
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,840
have a few drinks or even while filming,
you know.

256
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,720
But uh,
it's not like he's got a problem.

257
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,370
It's definitely is now a problem.
I've hung out with him.

258
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:19,810
He's,
he's,

259
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,040
he's healthy.
Hey,

260
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:26,041
that's as good as it gets.
You've got to fire tea without paying 

261
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:28,381
the price.
But it's amazing because everybody has 

262
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:30,391
this idea where most people that are in 
recovery that you can't do anything 

263
00:12:30,391 --> 00:12:31,450
right.
It was very few people I know that we'll

264
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:36,451
do something like,
I know a few guys who had alcohol 

265
00:12:36,451 --> 00:12:36,451
problems,
we'll smoke a little pot,

266
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,900
but uh,
or,

267
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,610
you know,
do a little mushrooms every now and then

268
00:12:39,611 --> 00:12:40,270
or something like that.

269
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:45,270
But he's one of those guys that he'll,
he'll do everything other than the 

270
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:45,310
heroin.
You know what I mean?

271
00:12:45,311 --> 00:12:50,311
If you can do that,
I think he's everybody's psychology 

272
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:50,311
psychologist.
Different.

273
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,310
Some people,
once they opened the door a tiny bit,

274
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:56,500
right.
Can Tell Dan I need to open it all the 

275
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:56,500
way.
I kind of stopped.

276
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,510
But then if you know your,
that kind of person yet,

277
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,770
then don't open into tiny bits then you 
shouldn't.

278
00:12:59,771 --> 00:13:04,771
But if you are not,
then what the hell is wrong with 

279
00:13:04,771 --> 00:13:06,520
enjoying a little bit if it really does.
I think it depends person to person.

280
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:10,270
Some people can do it that other people 
have to go cold Turkey or they can't.

281
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,410
Yeah,
that's definitely,

282
00:13:11,411 --> 00:13:13,220
that's definitely true.
It's um,

283
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:18,350
it's just cool to see someone do 
something positive always is because it 

284
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:22,471
gives you.
Inspiration is a real fuel for human 

285
00:13:22,471 --> 00:13:22,471
beings.

286
00:13:22,471 --> 00:13:26,430
When you see your friends or someone you
know that you like and they're doing 

287
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,600
something that's really transforming 
them and helping them,

288
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,240
it fires you up to.
Yeah.

289
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:35,270
I'm like the biggest way and every time 
I see you're the cheesiest the 

290
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:35,440
speciation of do I start crying like a 
baby.

291
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:36,920
I'm like,
move it.

292
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's everybody sitting.
Go like that to such pitch.

293
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,230
I don't cry over sad shit that much 
though.

294
00:13:45,231 --> 00:13:46,370
It's weird,
but it's.

295
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,010
My cat died.
I didn't cry.

296
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,990
I knew I've had her for 19 years.
I didn't cry.

297
00:13:49,991 --> 00:13:51,910
I felt bad.
I felt sad,

298
00:13:51,911 --> 00:13:56,911
but I felt like,
well she lived a great life and she was 

299
00:13:56,911 --> 00:13:57,040
a cool cat.
The but um,

300
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:00,790
it's not like if something cool happens,
something cool happens.

301
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:01,780
I'm like,
wow,

302
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,090
you know?
Yeah,

303
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,690
I'll have the same thing,
but it's like,

304
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:08,380
I think it would be like,
come on,

305
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,960
can I afford it?
That's what a bitch.

306
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,940
Where does chrom hang out?
These colleges having another.

307
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,200
He has a different place,
right?

308
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:18,560
I forget where it is.
They mix the toppling Balaji's though.

309
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,530
They played Lewis,
but yeah,

310
00:14:20,531 --> 00:14:22,990
I don't remember what crumb,
where chrome hung out.

311
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:31,550
Civy already human heads.
I was giving me a hard time on twitter 

312
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:34,090
the other day and it just for a Goof,
he was spelling was so atrocious.

313
00:14:34,091 --> 00:14:35,110
I was like,
oh my God,

314
00:14:35,111 --> 00:14:37,720
what does this go into?
Like I love it when people get mad at me

315
00:14:37,721 --> 00:14:39,310
over.
It was like a Ted Cruz posts.

316
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:43,960
He got mad over a.
So I went to his twitter page and uh,

317
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:49,290
I was just reading these posts about him
looking up into the heavens.

318
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,460
Wondering what,
you know,

319
00:14:52,461 --> 00:14:56,300
what God is like living in the clouds.
Like this motherfucker serious.

320
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:57,410
Like,
dude,

321
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:02,470
we could.
You could drive a fucking plane through 

322
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:02,470
the clouds,
asshole.

323
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,110
All right.
There's nothing up there.

324
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:09,010
That shit was back when people didn't 
have planes right now that we have 

325
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:09,380
planes.
You can't say that.

326
00:15:09,381 --> 00:15:10,900
God's right up there,
man in the closet.

327
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,480
No,
no,

328
00:15:11,481 --> 00:15:16,481
no.
Fucking southwest is up there going 

329
00:15:16,481 --> 00:15:16,481
right through the clouds with a jet and 
they give it out.

330
00:15:16,481 --> 00:15:16,880
Free.
Peanuts.

331
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:26,900
Peanuts.
EBC Dog got docking trying to avoid the 

332
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:26,900
planes.
And Tim it,

333
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:31,540
these Ted Cruz motherfuckers are scary.
They got a little victory under their 

334
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,110
belt and Iowa and they're doubling down 
on the Bible readings.

335
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,230
That's scary to me.
Oh,

336
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:38,000
that fucking guy.
Then we'll kind of take party socks,

337
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:43,001
but that I probably come parked has gone
so far off band that is just downright 

338
00:15:43,001 --> 00:15:43,190
nuts.
Well,

339
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,940
did you ever see that guy tweeted a 
quote the other day from Barry Goldwater

340
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,310
were barren,
cold water back in the fifties.

341
00:15:49,311 --> 00:15:54,311
It recognize that there was an issue 
with preachers and ministers in getting 

342
00:15:54,311 --> 00:15:55,880
involved in the Republican Party,
that they would ruin it.

343
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,980
I know.
That's the scary thing is that you'll go

344
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:03,040
back 50 years to the guys work when see 
that are not Kansas back in the day and 

345
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,550
they would be considered moderate 
centrist today.

346
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,460
They'd be like,
oh,

347
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,490
Barry Goldwater.
What the reasonable voice.

348
00:16:07,491 --> 00:16:12,491
He would always.
He was the one that was warning against 

349
00:16:12,491 --> 00:16:12,491
it.
Right?

350
00:16:12,491 --> 00:16:12,491
But no,
exactly.

351
00:16:12,491 --> 00:16:12,491
That's what I mean.
He's like,

352
00:16:12,491 --> 00:16:14,910
he had some positions that were three 
men,

353
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,840
but he will set a bunch of others that 
were very,

354
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,950
very reasonable the way it made sense,
you know,

355
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,240
and today he will be seen as fucking 
liberality.

356
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,030
Yeah,
it's a,

357
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:31,070
this,
these are strange times where it's the 

358
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:31,070
most,
it's kind of strange because this is the

359
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,160
most advanced,
uh,

360
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,940
as far as our ability to access 
information.

361
00:16:34,941 --> 00:16:39,941
It's never been like this before and as 
far as our ability to access studies and

362
00:16:40,461 --> 00:16:44,450
find out the actual real scientific 
facts about certain things.

363
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:49,750
But this is like,
it's more important now to profess a 

364
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,880
love or a belief in God when you're 
running for president,

365
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:55,040
I think,
than ever than ever.

366
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,890
You have to say it.
Like everybody has to say it.

367
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,210
Yeah.
There's never been one sad guy who could

368
00:17:00,211 --> 00:17:02,480
just skirt the question and not discuss 
it.

369
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:07,481
You have to go in and believe what I 
believe or not believe what I believe 

370
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:12,560
because I'm about to give you not want 
to make sure that is like,

371
00:17:12,561 --> 00:17:15,200
I thought I just stay away from the 
political discussions because they are.

372
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,710
There's no point in the weekend about 
zero point one sec when it becomes,

373
00:17:18,711 --> 00:17:19,580
fuck you,
fuck you.

374
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:22,320
And it's just there's not even a.
yeah,

375
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:27,360
there's not even like I get it.
If we had to eat our school and through 

376
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:27,360
oversee,
okay,

377
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,240
that can be fun.
It can be interesting to hell.

378
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,990
We can even let her for some stuff from 
each other,

379
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:35,230
but that's not even that point is just 
pure crazy extremist insults back and 

380
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:39,461
forth and I'm like,
just as my all time favorite election 

381
00:17:39,461 --> 00:17:39,461
all time.
Oh,

382
00:17:39,461 --> 00:17:42,020
it's the stupidest yet.
Is the shittiest choices.

383
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:46,040
The least inspired candidates.
This is the best one for me.

384
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,530
This is the best.
That's the only thing.

385
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,160
He had a whole show going on about

386
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,970
how happy he was that Donald trump was 
in the race for the entertainment factor

387
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:59,300
that does it because he was sick.
He was making a good point because they 

388
00:17:59,300 --> 00:17:59,300
say look,
like in the primaries,

389
00:17:59,300 --> 00:17:59,370
for example,
in the Republican primaries,

390
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:04,380
the game is you have to go zero point.
One millimeter more conservative than 

391
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,320
the next guy when the primaries,
but you don't want to go too far because

392
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:12,321
otherwise you lose the janitor of the 
lecture and you have trampled steps in 

393
00:18:12,321 --> 00:18:13,890
and it goes like 20 yards past everybody
else.

394
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,270
Everybody else is like,
shit,

395
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,100
if I don't follow you,
but lose the primary,

396
00:18:17,101 --> 00:18:19,010
but if I follow him,
I'm done in the general.

397
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,600
So that was having a blast with that.
He was laughing.

398
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,620
Which episode is a.
is a common sense or is either.

399
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:30,000
Why not?
Maybe after the first Republican debate,

400
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:30,830
that's what he was.

401
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,220
God,
I got to go listen to that throat.

402
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:34,310
I mean,
that's.

403
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:35,480
That's the way it is.
Well,

404
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,920
Donald Trump has nothing to lose.
Yeah.

405
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,810
I don't think he really wants to be 
president.

406
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,140
I really don't think he does and I think
that's why he's so outrageous,

407
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:48,530
but I think along the way he's kind of 
fucked himself because this is what 

408
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:51,591
people have been asking for.
People for the longest time have wanted 

409
00:18:51,591 --> 00:18:54,300
someone believe him or don't believe I'm
agree with him or don't agree with him.

410
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:59,301
He's speaking his mind right when he's 
saying he's saying because he doesn't 

411
00:18:59,521 --> 00:19:01,980
give a fuck.
There's no filter whatsoever.

412
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,180
He's talking about Mexicans.
Well,

413
00:19:03,181 --> 00:19:06,100
someone's doing the raping.
Fuck,

414
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,480
this guy's running for president.
It's time for putting a wall up like 

415
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,820
some fucking Berlin Wall up between us 
and Mexico.

416
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:15,990
Like,
Holy Shit,

417
00:19:15,991 --> 00:19:17,850
man,
that seems reasonable.

418
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:22,860
Does it?
It's going to let Railo that over the 

419
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,130
rapists one does.

420
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:24,980
There's no represent.
Well,

421
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:28,320
someone's doing the raping.
Someone's doing the raping here.

422
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:32,460
Jesus Christ.
That was half of the sixth grade.

423
00:19:32,461 --> 00:19:37,461
You can't even.
You can check like maybe a non on site 

424
00:19:37,461 --> 00:19:37,461
or it's hard to keep track of which was 
started.

425
00:19:37,461 --> 00:19:38,960
Odl was bullshit.
Well,

426
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
because they are so similar that it was 
wide where they asked him something 

427
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:47,910
about what does it take to make a,
make America great again.

428
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,830
Adhere had through this whole speech 
where he's clearly not answered.

429
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:55,900
You know,
he said running around just throwaway 

430
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:55,900
toward salad.
That had nothing to do with the question

431
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,120
at that.
He tends with him going like,

432
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,820
oh,
I look at the police turned up.

433
00:19:59,821 --> 00:20:01,750
That's an awesome at it.
Like this.

434
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:07,050
Like I've got to leave with this 
question because I don't want to deal 

435
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:09,321
with it.
They look at the guy with the 

436
00:20:09,321 --> 00:20:09,321
announcement.
Yeah,

437
00:20:09,321 --> 00:20:09,321
well he's a good medium man.

438
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,590
He's very good at.
He's been doing interviews for years and

439
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:16,090
he's also been on that reality show for 
a long time.

440
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:21,091
You got fired from it while running for 
this election because of the 

441
00:20:21,091 --> 00:20:22,860
inflammatory stuff.
He said about Mexicans though.

442
00:20:22,861 --> 00:20:27,861
It's a.
But I agree with you and this is 

443
00:20:27,861 --> 00:20:28,470
entertaining it past the point of being 
to the point that it's entertaining.

444
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:33,500
That's why I would dig a agenda that 
Sean tramping sanders because at that 

445
00:20:34,891 --> 00:20:37,740
point teacher so wild and weird that 
he's enjoyable.

446
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,340
You got,
you know,

447
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:41,990
the professional guys were like,
they measure every single statement,

448
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,300
uh,
you know,

449
00:20:42,301 --> 00:20:44,350
the politically internet.
It's,

450
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,040
it's boring.
You can write or the radio every single,

451
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:47,970
you know already

452
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,900
what's going to happen,
right?

453
00:20:48,901 --> 00:20:49,840
It's with someone.
These guys,

454
00:20:49,841 --> 00:20:52,210
you have no idea what the hell is going 
to come out of their mouth.

455
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:54,160
It's makes it for,
hey,

456
00:20:54,161 --> 00:20:56,590
at least I got to watch something that 
doesn't put me to sleep there.

457
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:02,130
Well,
you want to talking about putting me to 

458
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:02,130
sleep,
Hillary Clinton puts me to sleep because

459
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,090
there's nothing inspiring about what 
she's saying.

460
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:08,320
Nothing inspiring about her presence or 
her speeches,

461
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:11,470
but I think my daughter,
my seven year old daughter said it best.

462
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:16,471
She goes,
I would vote for her because she's a 

463
00:21:16,471 --> 00:21:16,960
girl.
That's a lot of people feel like that.

464
00:21:16,961 --> 00:21:17,680
I know.
I know.

465
00:21:17,681 --> 00:21:18,270
I know.
I know.

466
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,900
Like fuck it.
We had a black man.

467
00:21:19,901 --> 00:21:21,230
Let's have a white girl.
Right.

468
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,370
But it's like maybe you can pick some,
but okay,

469
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:25,480
sure.
You want that.

470
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,120
Pick somebody back there.
Jesus just who's better?

471
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,480
Elizabeth Warren.
Nine.

472
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:30,910
She's not in anymore.
Right?

473
00:21:30,911 --> 00:21:31,960
She,
she dropped out,

474
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:37,320
but when she was running they found out 
that she wasn't really native American 

475
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,541
and she tried to fake that.
You get a scholarship or something for 

476
00:21:40,871 --> 00:21:42,380
that.
I think that's what he was the,

477
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:46,990
the drop down the hall of fake.
That's one thing you can't fake.

478
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,540
You can fake like you're one eighth 
Swedish.

479
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,550
They will give you a hard time about it.
But if you say you one eighth,

480
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:54,360
native American and Torres on.
Oh No,

481
00:21:54,361 --> 00:21:59,361
that's fucking native American is like 
noble and mystical and you have like 

482
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:04,120
magic fucking eagle power.
So you can hear like a wolf that if you 

483
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:08,770
watch all the 19 sixties movies,
they were like Batty Indians will come 

484
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,000
into sculpture and chop your head off.
Why?

485
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,500
Because they already know what the fuck 
knows why.

486
00:22:11,501 --> 00:22:13,660
It's like the dragon in the story,
right?

487
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,430
Pulse 19 sixties is old.
Hug the furry creatures of the forest.

488
00:22:18,431 --> 00:22:20,410
I have a visual and said it's not what 
it was.

489
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,160
It was the guy in the commercial that 
cried when he saw the ground,

490
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,760
the garbage on the ground.
Oh,

491
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:29,820
that's what it was.
And incidentally that guy too was fucked

492
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:35,041
up is that that guy in that commercial 
where the Indians crying because white 

493
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:37,960
men are littering,
but we from the sixties on,

494
00:22:37,961 --> 00:22:42,961
we've sort of associated native 
Americans like spiritual things like 

495
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:46,120
dream catchers and this guy,
that guy is a Guinea.

496
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:51,150
He's from fucking name.
The same island has me looking at me and

497
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:56,410
his canoe is seeing the pick it up.
You fucking driving right past it.

498
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,320
You don't have to just look at it.
Dude,

499
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:00,430
throw it away.
Jesus Christ.

500
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,840
Give a hoot.
Don't pollute,

501
00:23:01,841 --> 00:23:06,841
but give a damn.
Pick that shit up man.

502
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:14,890
And he would,
he would pull up in his stupid fucking 

503
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,600
buffalo skin canoes and cry.
That was new.

504
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,640
But guys,
so Italian,

505
00:23:18,641 --> 00:23:21,790
he could be on the sopranos that made 
them wear a wig and shit.

506
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:26,800
Yep.
People are throwing things out the 

507
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:26,800
window right at his feet and he could 
ice.

508
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,920
Oh,
it could all go to Bonnie fuel.

509
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:35,300
I don't cry too.
Something about keep America beautiful.

510
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,360
Yeah.
Well it definitely shouldn't be like 

511
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:40,360
hanging out by the highway either.
So yeah,

512
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,570
it doesn't tell.
Just standing there was moccasins on and

513
00:23:41,571 --> 00:23:42,770
shit.
Yeah.

514
00:23:42,771 --> 00:23:47,771
But,
but native Americans from like that 

515
00:23:47,771 --> 00:23:50,681
point on where they're associated with 
like a sweat lodge is pod ceremonies and

516
00:23:51,171 --> 00:23:54,350
spiritual things and you know,
we have these ideas.

517
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:59,620
There's a lot of people,
they have these ideas of native 

518
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,291
Americans that they lived off the land 
and they used every last piece of the 

519
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:04,010
animal and they had a spiritual 
connection to their surroundings,

520
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,270
which,
you know,

521
00:24:05,271 --> 00:24:07,700
a lot of is true.
There's a lot of truth in that,

522
00:24:07,701 --> 00:24:09,530
but that's the problem with stereotypes,
right?

523
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,210
You take 17,
that's partially true,

524
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:14,680
and then you blow it up the entirety of 
the experience,

525
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:19,730
so torn with the carrier at that point 
is very far from debbie out of the deal.

526
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,190
Well my friend,
Steven Rinella,

527
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:26,150
the host of the mediator has the best 
stories of native Americans.

528
00:24:26,151 --> 00:24:31,151
He has a deep knowledge of the history 
of native Americans and he's got some 

529
00:24:31,151 --> 00:24:33,320
fantastic stories about the Nez perce.
First of all,

530
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:36,090
they were fucking cannibals.
Alright.

531
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:40,910
That was super common to not only attack
neighboring tribes,

532
00:24:40,911 --> 00:24:43,130
but to eat them,
eat their babies,

533
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,680
eat their family.
Yeah,

534
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,960
eat them rail.
Yeah.

535
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,050
There was a lot of cannibalism going on 
in the old west,

536
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:52,670
especially apparently amongst the Great 
Lakes area in the Great Lakes area.

537
00:24:52,671 --> 00:24:54,710
That's for sure.
Why is that?

538
00:24:54,711 --> 00:24:57,140
Is it just because it's called know 
different people?

539
00:24:57,141 --> 00:24:58,580
You know?
It's kind of like the culture.

540
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:03,650
In fact,
that's why it's hard to generalize with 

541
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:03,650
distinctions among native stuff is so 
much difference.

542
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:04,850
You know,
the guys put on them to Great Lakes have

543
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:07,940
nothing to do with the guys from the 
plains to do with.

544
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,330
So each one is.
But yeah,

545
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,240
good.
A plague stuff is pretty intense.

546
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:15,110
The fire that I liked the most about 
that is on you will,

547
00:25:15,111 --> 00:25:16,850
would go out to get captives,
you know,

548
00:25:16,851 --> 00:25:21,851
you will go on at wateraid,
you'll get copies this and once you see 

549
00:25:21,851 --> 00:25:21,851
you get captured,
you have one of two options.

550
00:25:21,851 --> 00:25:25,040
If they like you,
then they adopt you as a family member.

551
00:25:25,041 --> 00:25:28,160
You replace one of their dead family 
members so you get treated that way.

552
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:31,790
You are love you.
They don't like you so much.

553
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:34,050
Then they torture you through that over 
a four day period.

554
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:36,450
So it's,
yeah,

555
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:40,820
it's blitzing skydeck,
but it's kind of a flip of a coin data,

556
00:25:40,821 --> 00:25:42,920
which I guess are lyrically clean.
Tony was a good thing,

557
00:25:42,921 --> 00:25:44,720
but for everybody else,
not so much.

558
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,720
Yeah.
He told me the story of this one guy got

559
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:47,330
captured.

560
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,340
There was two guys captured.
One Guy,

561
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,580
they killed him,
killed him in front of his friend,

562
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:57,910
and then they told him,
I think they might've aid them in front 

563
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:58,820
of his friend too.
They killed them and then they told him,

564
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:00,320
we're going to take off all your 
clothes.

565
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:03,050
We're going to let you run and if you 
can get away you can live.

566
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:08,560
And so this mother ran like the wind 
jumped in the freezing cold river and 

567
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,690
hidden a beaver dam.
Nope.

568
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,870
He got smart enough to climb up into a 
beaver dam,

569
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:16,871
which by the way is a risk and a fucking
half because what if it climb in there 

570
00:26:16,871 --> 00:26:18,380
and the beavers in there that beavers 
gonna fuck you up.

571
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:23,530
People have died from before.
If beaver bites your artery leader or 

572
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:24,230
shoot,
they shoot the retreat.

573
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,260
That will fuck you up.
And uh,

574
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:31,450
this guy,
he fucking made it and he walked for 

575
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:33,800
days and some ungodly amount of miles 
naked by the way,

576
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:38,801
freezing cold,
lived off of whatever he grabbed and 

577
00:26:38,801 --> 00:26:41,441
stuff in his mouth and eat that.
And I managed to survive some crazy way 

578
00:26:41,441 --> 00:26:43,710
and lived to tell the story.
Some of the.

579
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,100
That's what

580
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,630
I dig like for history on fire,
those kind of stories that are so like,

581
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:52,730
it's like,
come on the screenwriter from game of 

582
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:52,730
thrones,
throne that right,

583
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:52,730
it can be real and then you dig it and 
he's like,

584
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:57,681
no,
there's reality and there's wars and 

585
00:26:57,681 --> 00:26:58,110
it's more intense than anything you 
could imagine the revenant.

586
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,760
Isn't that based on a real story and.
Yeah,

587
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,530
it's um,
yeah,

588
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:04,010
that don't.
Is that guy as bigly entail?

589
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,570
They kind of tailored it a little bit,
you know,

590
00:27:06,571 --> 00:27:10,250
there was no Indian song and there was 
none of that power to.

591
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:15,590
It's always an Indian.
I know there's no sell it to white 

592
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:15,940
people.
You've got to throw an Indian in there.

593
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:21,020
The them like they been into black elk 
hunting and then the Grizzly fucking 

594
00:27:21,991 --> 00:27:26,130
game up or just two guys leaving for dad
and taking off even with this rifle.

595
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,230
That's all true.
But yeah,

596
00:27:28,231 --> 00:27:29,870
they,
they tweak it a little bit.

597
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:34,910
Somebody needs to write a movie about 
that suit Akins lady that lives up in 

598
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:38,361
Alaska because that lady got,
she's the one who's on that show life 

599
00:27:38,361 --> 00:27:39,120
below zero.
I heard about it.

600
00:27:39,121 --> 00:27:44,121
I guess she lives 200 miles plus above 
the arctic circle in this place called 

601
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:45,180
Kavach.
She was one of my guests.

602
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:48,030
She's amazing.
Amazing.

603
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:53,570
I mean,
she is as fucking gangster as a human 

604
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:55,110
being can get by by just being awesome.
Just so cool.

605
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,540
He's a really nice,
intelligent woman,

606
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,380
you know,
she's,

607
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,960
she's just like so powerful.
Anyway,

608
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:06,320
she was up there and she got attacked by
a bear and fucked up real bad.

609
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,640
Broke her hip.
I think.

610
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:11,250
Broke her leg,
fucked her head up.

611
00:28:11,251 --> 00:28:13,410
I think it cracked her skull like 
serious,

612
00:28:13,411 --> 00:28:15,600
serious injuries.
She survived.

613
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:19,050
She crawled back to her,
her dwelling.

614
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:21,570
She doesn't even live in a house because
where she lives,

615
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,210
you're not allowed to put permanent 
residences.

616
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,580
So they're like 10 things that are up 
there.

617
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:28,070
Yeah.
They're made out of cloth.

618
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:33,380
These like weird sort of buildings with 
like wire structures and it's thick 

619
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:36,990
canvas tops and she was there for days 
before someone.

620
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,300
She owns like a refueling station up 
there.

621
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,340
Someone flew in,
they found her,

622
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:45,150
they brought her to medical help and 
patched her up,

623
00:28:45,151 --> 00:28:46,860
fixed her up.
She heals up,

624
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,890
goes back,
shoots that bear and eats it.

625
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:53,580
That's the way he wanted to do it.
That pitches gangster as fuck.

626
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:58,740
Yeah.
You imagine eating a bear just cutting 

627
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,050
into the you motherfucker.
Not So cocky.

628
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,730
That's a bad ass revenge tale.
Let's do it.

629
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,930
Fuck yeah,
man.

630
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,440
To her watching the revenant.
He's like,

631
00:29:07,441 --> 00:29:08,700
yeah,
that's Thursday morning.

632
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:09,980
Whatever.
Come on Pussy.

633
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,960
I mean,
it's amazing.

634
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:17,190
The cloth fan.
Norco for the Arctic.

635
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:19,850
I mean that we Mahal for would be with 
right.

636
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,030
She's a grandma.
A.

637
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:21,780
Yeah,
of course.

638
00:29:21,781 --> 00:29:26,781
He's like pinched the gun kids,
so I've seen the bear's heart.

639
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,820
Jesus Christ.
She's crazy.

640
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,710
Yeah,
but that's what she enjoys.

641
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:36,980
She enjoys living out there in the 
wilderness with the wolves and foxes and

642
00:29:37,141 --> 00:29:39,240
the bears and the Caribou.
She loves it.

643
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,070
She loves going out and shooting or 
meals

644
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:45,730
and bringing them home and cutting it 
does all the butchering.

645
00:29:45,731 --> 00:29:48,760
All the food she gets,
she gets from the land around her.

646
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:52,360
She's just a wild.
It's just like the life she loves.

647
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,420
She found it and,
and she's smart man.

648
00:29:55,421 --> 00:30:00,421
Like she could do a lot of shit.
She's not a in an unresourceful person 

649
00:30:00,421 --> 00:30:03,070
who's trapped up there.
She just really truly enjoys it.

650
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:06,610
That's a choice native person,
which is absolutely fascinating person.

651
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:08,920
She's one of my favorite all time 
guests.

652
00:30:08,921 --> 00:30:11,380
I need to move back to Danielle.
He bought his course.

653
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:16,670
I need to go back and catch that one.
I think I saw he was there and I didn't 

654
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:16,670
catch it too.
I need to listen again,

655
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,670
so he's amazing.
Myself or I missed it.

656
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,170
I would like to go up there and hang out
with her.

657
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:25,850
She sounded awesome.
I would have to go up there in the 

658
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:25,850
winter though.

659
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:25,850
Otherwise it'd be a pussy.
You can't go up there.

660
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:31,260
Hey Kim in July,
but I bet it's cold fucking July to.

661
00:30:32,441 --> 00:30:33,530
Yeah,
exactly too,

662
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,130
but I think.
What is the time of year where you go to

663
00:30:36,131 --> 00:30:39,280
see the Aurora Borealis?
The northern lights?

664
00:30:39,281 --> 00:30:40,240
I haven't been.
I don't know.

665
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:44,350
I think that is a summer thing.
Is that a summer thing or is that an all

666
00:30:44,351 --> 00:30:46,480
year round thing?
No idea.

667
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:51,570
I don't know either,
but that would be worth traveling just 

668
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:51,570
to see.
That's supposed to be insane.

669
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:53,200
Yeah,
that's like the whole sky is filled with

670
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:57,120
green missed either died or you can stay
in La and take them out.

671
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:58,450
Shirt with sudden.
You've got to say,

672
00:30:58,451 --> 00:30:59,580
but it's better,
right?

673
00:30:59,581 --> 00:31:00,400
Yeah,
that's better.

674
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:03,420
You have to know that.
Just.

675
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,530
Do you ever been to Alaska?
No.

676
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,150
Never know.
What's crazy about it,

677
00:31:07,151 --> 00:31:09,520
man?
It's how big it is when you fly over it,

678
00:31:09,521 --> 00:31:11,770
you go like Jesus Christ and you look at
it on a map.

679
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:12,910
You're like,
what the fuck?

680
00:31:12,911 --> 00:31:14,800
That place is?
I think it's the biggest state.

681
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,310
Is it the biggest?
Isn't really.

682
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,810
Yeah,
by far.

683
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:20,860
Jamie says.
Yeah,

684
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:24,190
I think it's like almost too Texas's.
Seriously.

685
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:28,540
They do some really shitty job with man.
Find out how many Texas's fit in Alaska.

686
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:33,541
Oh,
they do a shitty job with math does not 

687
00:31:33,541 --> 00:31:33,541
look like two times.
Texas.

688
00:31:33,541 --> 00:31:36,840
Well,
if you ever seen how big Africa really 

689
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:36,840
is,
like when people talk about Africa,

690
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:38,740
I think people get this idea that 
Africa,

691
00:31:38,741 --> 00:31:41,350
the continent of Africa is similar to 
the continent of North America,

692
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:45,580
but it's not even close.
Look at this sick Jesus Christ twice the

693
00:31:45,581 --> 00:31:46,750
size of Texas.
Yeah,

694
00:31:46,751 --> 00:31:48,220
that is huge.
Damn.

695
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:52,450
Alaska is larger than all but 18 
sovereign countries.

696
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:57,810
Holy Shit.
Look how big it is when you put it in 

697
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:59,050
the middle of America.
Freaky fucking a man.

698
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:04,770
God.
It's huge and it's so lightly populated.

699
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,020
It's amazing.
I fucking love it up there.

700
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:10,330
I got to get back.
When was the last time?

701
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,870
Two years ago,
Ari Shaffir and I did a anchorage.

702
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:16,630
We did a comedy show up there and went 
salmon fishing.

703
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:22,160
Saw some.
I saw my first movie I ever saw some 

704
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:22,160
eagles for the first time.
That was awesome.

705
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:27,010
He goes,
or he told me that they were pretty 

706
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:27,010
intense.
Oh,

707
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:27,010
there's.
So.

708
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:30,310
It's so strange when you look in a wild 
eagle in the eye,

709
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:35,730
you know,
even though it's kind of far away and 

710
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:35,730
they don't let you get that close to 
them,

711
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:38,971
but when you're passing by,
we were on a boat and we're passing by 

712
00:32:38,971 --> 00:32:38,971
these trees and there's an eagle up in 
the tree and you're like,

713
00:32:38,971 --> 00:32:40,680
Whoa,
what the fuck?

714
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,500
I big fucking animals.
That's for sure.

715
00:32:42,501 --> 00:32:44,720
They don't get hunted by people either,
so they're not afraid of people,

716
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,420
but you know,
they're not stupid either,

717
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:53,920
but that places a legitimately wild 
place in that when you get out of your 

718
00:32:54,321 --> 00:32:58,820
car,
you have to run to where you're going.

719
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,920
Are you going to get swarmed by 
mosquitoes that.

720
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,150
Yeah,
that's what I heard about.

721
00:33:02,151 --> 00:33:04,010
That's the part that I didn't like about
Alaska.

722
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,720
I call it sound awesome.
And then I heard about the level of 

723
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:09,770
like,
intensity is mosquito wise.

724
00:33:09,771 --> 00:33:10,650
I was like,
yeah,

725
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:12,530
okay.
That Ari and I were laughing.

726
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,810
We couldn't even believe it.
Like this is ridiculous.

727
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,630
Like I'm not kidding,
like open up the car door.

728
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:22,820
Um,
put your boots on and just the time it 

729
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:25,751
takes to open the door and get your 
boots on the car is filled with 

730
00:33:25,751 --> 00:33:26,720
mosquitoes,
like hundreds of mosquitoes,

731
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,840
like a swarm.
They find you instantly.

732
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,780
What's about to climb out there that 
attracts mosquitoes so much?

733
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:37,810
I think they're just fucking desperado 
because they know they're only gonna be 

734
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:37,880
alive for a month,
you know,

735
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:43,060
that's what I think.
And there's like three humans to buy it 

736
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:43,060
and sanders.
Gotcha.

737
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:43,400
I think,
I mean,

738
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:45,380
do they bite other animals?
Right?

739
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,440
Definitely.
So I just don't think that they have 

740
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,830
much time.
I think they only stay alive for a short

741
00:33:51,831 --> 00:33:53,300
period of time,
so while they're at it,

742
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:55,610
they're addicts,
so they are berserker mosquitoes.

743
00:33:55,611 --> 00:33:58,010
Just going for it then.
Well yeah,

744
00:33:58,011 --> 00:34:00,200
that's a scary fucking place.
Fuel have.

745
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,970
Yeah.
More so than Florida.

746
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,610
You would think like Florida mosquitoes 
would be the most rabid.

747
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,700
That's how you figure tropical place.
Lots of humidity.

748
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,670
All of the Florida people though they're
fat and lazy.

749
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,170
They could get these.
It's like,

750
00:34:14,171 --> 00:34:15,860
ah,
there'd be another tourist.

751
00:34:15,861 --> 00:34:18,050
I couldn't get that one.
I don't have to chase these one.

752
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:21,140
Yeah.
Florida has its own problems though,

753
00:34:21,141 --> 00:34:22,390
man.
Florida is.

754
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:27,460
It's so funny.
They're doing a big python hunt now 

755
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,200
because so many people have released 
pythons in Florida that they,

756
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:34,300
they've bred and overread.
They have like a gigantic python 

757
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:38,861
invasion problem to the point where 
they're offering rewards for people to 

758
00:34:38,861 --> 00:34:40,840
kill Python's.
The headlines that come out of Florida,

759
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:44,150
one of the things that are at constant 
stone source of entertainment,

760
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:45,860
you get things that are like,
again,

761
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,310
these must be the on your right.
It's too fucking crazy.

762
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:49,370
Then you it into like,
no,

763
00:34:49,371 --> 00:34:51,380
that was real.
That really up and yeah,

764
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:56,381
there's a great twitter page called 
Florida man and it's just filled every 

765
00:34:57,290 --> 00:35:02,290
day.
There's some new crazy shit some guy 

766
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:02,290
tried to do while huffing paint.
Fucking dog.

767
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,620
It just,
it's not a real state.

768
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:08,750
What did I read?
What was the last thing?

769
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,930
Oh yeah.
This guy was um,

770
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,880
at all been a house and I think the 
owners get back.

771
00:35:13,881 --> 00:35:16,050
So the guy to call and they were looking
for anyway.

772
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:20,810
Flashlights like it dove in this pond 
right outside alligator.

773
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,750
Exactly.
Yeah.

774
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,300
Team.
Yeah.

775
00:35:23,301 --> 00:35:28,301
I've heard that before.
There was another one recently real 

776
00:35:28,301 --> 00:35:28,340
similar where they were chasing this guy
in a stolen car.

777
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:33,520
The guy gets to a bridge,
jumps off the bridge and immediately 

778
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,870
gets jacked by an alligator,
like literally jumped on an alligator.

779
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:37,800
Good timing.
Good job man.

780
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:42,750
But you got to be fucking crazy to jump 
in the water with those things,

781
00:35:42,751 --> 00:35:43,330
man,
if you've seen.

782
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:47,940
Have you seen an alligator scared be big
ass fucking dinosaurs.

783
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:51,090
They're not as dangerous as Nile 
crocodiles,

784
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,810
which coincidentally have also been 
released in the everglades.

785
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:59,910
Good.
They have a shoot on sight kill on site 

786
00:35:59,910 --> 00:35:59,910
order.
If anybody sees a Nile,

787
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:04,371
crocodile is supposed to kill them 
onsite because they've started to breed 

788
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:05,670
in the everglades.
So you're talking about those 18,

789
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,680
20 foot long,
gigantic African crocodiles that take 

790
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,210
out willdabeast yeah.
Let's say you live in Florida too.

791
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,050
Yeah,
that's a rough state.

792
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,930
It's funny man,
because all the tree huggers,

793
00:36:18,931 --> 00:36:20,550
they're like,
don't kill the pythons.

794
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,840
Not Their fault.
Like,

795
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:26,880
okay,
you know how big pythons kit you crazy 

796
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:26,880
bitch.
They're gonna.

797
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:26,880
Eat your family.
They'll.

798
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,500
They'll eat babies,
they eat people.

799
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:31,950
Fuck man.
Florida.

800
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:35,950
The joys of nature.
I've been watching narcos on Netflix.

801
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:38,670
Thinks about it.
So good.

802
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:44,160
I'm sad because there's only two 
episodes left and I don't know if 

803
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,600
they're doing a second season.
I don't know if they can.

804
00:36:45,601 --> 00:36:48,120
I mean,
I think Pablo Escobar gets caught.

805
00:36:48,121 --> 00:36:50,700
I think that's the end of that,
unless it goes on further.

806
00:36:50,701 --> 00:36:55,701
I don't know though.
I wasn't totally aware of the entire 

807
00:36:55,701 --> 00:36:59,811
story of Escobar.
I just knew that he was a drug dealer 

808
00:36:59,811 --> 00:37:00,420
and I knew,
fuck man,

809
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:02,930
those guys.
Look,

810
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:05,760
it's so well done to the show.
So.

811
00:37:05,761 --> 00:37:06,660
Well done.
Yeah,

812
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:07,860
no,
that's a.

813
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:10,800
that's on my watch list because I ever 
done it.

814
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:15,860
Every single person I talked to told me 
to tell someone that one insane he went 

815
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:20,631
to war.
I mean I don't really want to tell 

816
00:37:20,631 --> 00:37:22,431
anybody anything about it because it's 
fucking shocking and it builds up really

817
00:37:22,441 --> 00:37:27,441
well.
Like it really builds up well from the 

818
00:37:27,441 --> 00:37:30,450
early days of his drug dealer.
Just finding out about drugs to the end.

819
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,420
But that's what's funny about it that 
people got old like,

820
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:38,480
oh the Kadima now the mafia,
that when you look at like mafia 

821
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,530
stories,
they are identical to the history of any

822
00:37:40,531 --> 00:37:41,970
state or if any nation,
you know,

823
00:37:41,971 --> 00:37:43,080
it.
Just the dynamics that are.

824
00:37:43,081 --> 00:37:47,430
Did you know wine is in a suit and tie.
The other one is with the AK 47,

825
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,430
but other than that,
the bezirk seeing.

826
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,820
Sorry,
it's a struggle for power.

827
00:37:50,821 --> 00:37:54,090
It's a game off fuck over your enemies 
sheets.

828
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:57,270
The other one who can get you do what 
you can expand your.

829
00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:02,310
It's the same story over and over.
Whether you're talking about that 

830
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:02,940
extended to great or fabulous go buyer 
is not that different.

831
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,840
Really know the specifics are slightly 
different,

832
00:38:06,841 --> 00:38:09,180
but the big picture is not.
It's a struggle for power.

833
00:38:09,181 --> 00:38:14,181
End of story and it seems like when you 
get to the really high levels of finance

834
00:38:14,941 --> 00:38:19,941
and of volume and the amount of troops 
in the amount of people that you're 

835
00:38:19,941 --> 00:38:23,811
controlling the area control,
that's when the real trostle he's 

836
00:38:23,811 --> 00:38:26,580
kicking like you almost.
It's almost a universal that horrific 

837
00:38:27,331 --> 00:38:32,331
acts get done to intimidate your enemy 
and to make sure that you retain control

838
00:38:33,301 --> 00:38:36,220
over certain certain areas.

839
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,480
Yeah,
it's hard to sing.

840
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:42,481
Where is like in that sense you might.
History's really kind of fucked up and 

841
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:48,400
weird when you.
If you approach it with them through a 

842
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,671
moral lens because you see so many nasty
things take place and in the weird ones 

843
00:38:50,671 --> 00:38:54,871
are the ones who were.
There really is no good solution where 

844
00:38:54,871 --> 00:38:54,871
you don't know what the healthy thing 
would be like.

845
00:38:54,871 --> 00:38:58,600
There's one that I was researching for a
history on fire maybe a year from now or

846
00:38:58,601 --> 00:39:03,601
something.
I was searching distorted from the 19 

847
00:39:03,601 --> 00:39:06,250
eighties in El Salvador.
At that time there was a a right wing 

848
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:10,651
government in El Salvador to the US 
government was supporting and there was 

849
00:39:10,651 --> 00:39:12,100
a leftist gallery are there was in the 
logic of the cold war.

850
00:39:12,101 --> 00:39:14,020
There are only two options here,
either protocol,

851
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:15,450
Muni story,
our pro us.

852
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,750
There's nothing in between.
Right?

853
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,920
So in the process of fighting these 
leftist Galleria,

854
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:24,940
the government of El Salvador is doing 
nasty things right to anybody will 

855
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:28,291
criticize them,
doesn't matter whether they're a 

856
00:39:28,291 --> 00:39:28,291
communist or not.

857
00:39:28,291 --> 00:39:30,860
To get tortured that chop off their 
bodies will leave them in the middle of 

858
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:34,441
the streets.
American Congress at that point because 

859
00:39:34,441 --> 00:39:34,441
like,
oh shit,

860
00:39:34,441 --> 00:39:38,610
you know,
we can really keep sending millions of 

861
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:41,130
dollars to.
These guys were doing horrible human 

862
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:43,291
rights violations,
so they pass this law that in order for 

863
00:39:43,291 --> 00:39:45,340
any more aid to be sent to the governor 
of the sound of other,

864
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:50,640
the president of the United States has 
to sign off on a document stating that 

865
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,540
these guys have made huge improvements 
in their human rights record,

866
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,300
that they are on the right path,
you know it's getting better.

867
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:01,200
Problem is the deadline is coming up 
that a gun is each and to be able to 

868
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,401
send out all these millions of dollars 
to the government of itself rather and 

869
00:40:05,401 --> 00:40:09,350
in that moment,
the Salvadorian army on these offensive 

870
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:12,151
against the gallery and they find some 
villages that just wanted to be left the

871
00:40:12,761 --> 00:40:13,300
fuck alone.

872
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:16,090
They were not pro communist,
but they are not anticommunist theater.

873
00:40:16,091 --> 00:40:18,820
They were like bunch of Evangelical 
Christians,

874
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:22,150
peasants who just wanted to farm their 
fields and be left alone so he.

875
00:40:22,151 --> 00:40:23,710
They will lead.
The communists go through.

876
00:40:23,711 --> 00:40:26,260
They will let the army go through to 
figure if we stay neutral.

877
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:28,360
Everything works out right?
Well,

878
00:40:28,361 --> 00:40:31,540
not in the Cold War and the Cold War.
There is no neutrality are either on one

879
00:40:31,541 --> 00:40:34,390
side or the other,
so Salvadorian army come in,

880
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:38,110
grab every single villagers,
separate the men from the women,

881
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:41,620
kilos demand or April.
The women don't kill them all,

882
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:45,670
kill everybody in that village and New 
York Times.

883
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:49,070
The New York Times did an article on it 
and I'm now.

884
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:50,200
Reagan was like,
Oh shit,

885
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,610
what do I do now?
So he said,

886
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,580
the guy who wrote this article,
it some crazy communist.

887
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:57,610
None of these is through is a smear 
campaign against our allies.

888
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:00,400
The government has made huge 
improvements.

889
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:05,400
I'm sending that millions of dollars of 
course years down the road and saw that 

890
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:09,291
the original story,
it was through that the staff did that 

891
00:41:09,291 --> 00:41:10,720
happen and the but other than bitching 
about Reagan,

892
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:15,721
this is not even an anti Reagan thing is
that it's a messy situation because you 

893
00:41:15,721 --> 00:41:17,030
do support the government of Assad 
rather.

894
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:20,140
You're literally supporting death 
squads.

895
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:23,410
Child rapists mean it doesn't really get
any worse than that.

896
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:29,340
You don't support them.
There's a chance that hillside rather 

897
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:33,500
who turn into a communist state,
in which case he's not exactly like 

898
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,030
communism around the world is a higher 
reputational for human rights.

899
00:41:35,031 --> 00:41:36,260
It's fucking awful.
Right?

900
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:38,630
So he's like,
what do you choice here?

901
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,400
No,
the you choose to support them or do you

902
00:41:40,401 --> 00:41:41,340
choose?
It's like,

903
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:46,720
how do you see what I'm going like?
It's a situation where no matter what 

904
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:46,720
you choose,
you're fucked.

905
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:51,550
You're doing bad things.
But clearly the moment our support in 

906
00:41:52,011 --> 00:41:54,740
death squads that can not be the right 
solution,

907
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:57,710
but at the same time,
what is the right solution?

908
00:41:57,711 --> 00:42:00,250
What is the good thing you should do?
You know,

909
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:02,090
character at the same exact problem.
You know?

910
00:42:02,091 --> 00:42:04,730
Right before Reagan Carter,
some guide,

911
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:06,560
the Archbishop of El Salvador,
this guy,

912
00:42:06,561 --> 00:42:11,561
Oscar Romero sent him a letter saying,
stop fucking sending money to my 

913
00:42:11,561 --> 00:42:13,840
government because they are doing 
horrible things with it cart.

914
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:14,990
I was like,
Eh,

915
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:18,290
I don't want to look at this because 
this is politically traveling for me.

916
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:22,630
So two weeks later that squats,
walking into the main church and outside

917
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,770
of authorities,
guy was celebrating mass.

918
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:26,540
They gunned him down,
killed him,

919
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:29,300
so he's not a Republican or democratic 
thing,

920
00:42:29,301 --> 00:42:31,310
you know,
it's like both sides of the game.

921
00:42:31,311 --> 00:42:36,311
They are did not know how to handle this
in a situation where it's like which 

922
00:42:36,311 --> 00:42:40,840
mass murderers and we support and which 
ones do we oppose because that's the 

923
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:44,381
reality of it was like those are the 
stories or like what the fuck do you do?

924
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,510
What is the right thing to do?
Windows case,

925
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:49,310
there almost is no right thing.
Right,

926
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:54,730
exactly.
When you're dealing with certain parts 

927
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:56,771
of the world that have been embattled,
they've been just in inter tangled in 

928
00:42:58,251 --> 00:43:01,640
these horrible bitter feuds and 
rivalries.

929
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:06,850
Horrible things get done and war and 
when you're dealing with two horrible 

930
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:10,361
groups and you can't really 
differentiate substantially one being 

931
00:43:10,361 --> 00:43:15,281
more moral or ethical that over the 
other one and oftentimes like if you 

932
00:43:15,281 --> 00:43:19,481
were more and more or more ethical,
you wouldn't survive in those terrible 

933
00:43:19,481 --> 00:43:20,690
environments.
Like you have to do horrible things just

934
00:43:20,691 --> 00:43:24,750
in order to stay above water and that's 
what keeps it.

935
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:29,890
The stories keep you on your toes 
because if you condemned wine and not 

936
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:29,890
the other yarn,
paypal credit,

937
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:30,540
if you can.
Then the other,

938
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:33,710
the first year and a booklet,
if we get even to what we are seeing,

939
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:34,850
which is the right thing,
right,

940
00:43:34,851 --> 00:43:35,330
is like,
well,

941
00:43:35,331 --> 00:43:37,670
it's a fucked up situation and you have 
to do terrible things.

942
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:39,680
If you say too easily,
it's like,

943
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:40,490
oh yeah,
well,

944
00:43:40,491 --> 00:43:42,770
so go chop.
The kids had had off no big deal.

945
00:43:42,771 --> 00:43:45,230
So you have to,
you say Baylor,

946
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:50,300
so safe to say the opposite.
It's like it's a weird dynamic there 

947
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:52,310
where there's no real place where you 
feel comfortable.

948
00:43:52,311 --> 00:43:52,940
Like,
ah,

949
00:43:52,941 --> 00:43:55,520
that was the right thing to do.
I can glad we made the right call.

950
00:43:55,521 --> 00:43:57,950
Now I can go through easy and stuff.
Well,

951
00:43:57,951 --> 00:44:00,260
let me ask you this because you're a 
legit historian.

952
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:05,410
Was there ever a time in human history 
where there was like a noble ethical 

953
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,370
government of any sort of,
uh,

954
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:13,450
an empire or country that didn't engage 
in any human rights and did the right 

955
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:18,341
thing?
Like was there a utopian government and 

956
00:44:18,341 --> 00:44:18,341
anytime in history?
No,

957
00:44:18,341 --> 00:44:20,000
I think you've got these different 
degrees of fucking up.

958
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:21,590
Some degrees they're like,
ah,

959
00:44:21,591 --> 00:44:22,550
that's not that bad.

960
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:23,480
Come on.
We can.

961
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:25,070
We can live with that,
but we can live with.

962
00:44:25,071 --> 00:44:30,071
That does not mean it's good.
It's still kind of Shitty is just a lot 

963
00:44:30,071 --> 00:44:31,380
less shitty than the alternatives 
outside of modern times.

964
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:36,440
What's the most Utopian version of a 
government that ever sort of ran?

965
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:41,190
I think what you get is in you do around
into society.

966
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,280
Swear may be like for example,
if you have low population,

967
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:45,840
vancity hunters,
I'm glad that are,

968
00:44:45,841 --> 00:44:50,841
but the keyword being low population 
density because once you have too many 

969
00:44:50,841 --> 00:44:53,901
people,
they compete for hunting grounds and 

970
00:44:53,901 --> 00:44:55,761
they do horrible things to each other,
but if you have a relatively low 

971
00:44:55,761 --> 00:44:56,370
population density,
these guys,

972
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:01,400
there's really no reason to go to war 
with another tribe over wealth because 

973
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:05,521
they are nomadic.
You have to fucking carry it on your 

974
00:45:05,521 --> 00:45:05,521
back.
You don't want.

975
00:45:05,521 --> 00:45:05,521
I don't want your shit.

976
00:45:05,521 --> 00:45:05,970
They have to carry it to them.
That's part of the work,

977
00:45:05,971 --> 00:45:08,720
so you don't do.
You don't fight over weld.

978
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:13,790
You don't fight over religion because 
most of these guys have have kind of 

979
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:15,180
inclusive approach where whatever you do
that works good for you.

980
00:45:15,181 --> 00:45:19,320
There's no competition there,
so you have removed two huge things that

981
00:45:19,321 --> 00:45:21,600
people do nasty things to each other 
over.

982
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:25,500
They're still fighting over.
I'm hunting grounds.

983
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:29,250
They're still fighting over women,
so that will still happen,

984
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:32,010
but so it's not an idea like utopia.
Oh,

985
00:45:32,011 --> 00:45:35,450
those noble hunters and gatherers who 
could do no wrong.

986
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:37,410
No,
they did horrible things to each other.

987
00:45:37,411 --> 00:45:41,560
They just have less reasons to do so.
Then later societies,

988
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,780
so agriculture in cities and 
civilizations,

989
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:47,820
that's when things started getting 
really rough.

990
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:48,420
Well,
I mean,

991
00:45:48,421 --> 00:45:53,421
again,
it's the placenta mine Australian 

992
00:45:53,421 --> 00:45:54,210
glasses because you stay in one place 
and you can accumulate wealth.

993
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,730
Now I don't have to carry every single 
human on my back.

994
00:45:56,731 --> 00:45:59,400
Every few days I can sit in one place in
the coma late.

995
00:45:59,401 --> 00:46:02,070
Well,
you do start seeing the growth of social

996
00:46:02,071 --> 00:46:03,510
class as you do.
Start seeing.

997
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:04,730
I mean,
I'm a hunters and gatherers.

998
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:06,690
You don't have reach hunter and gather 
under poor line.

999
00:46:06,691 --> 00:46:08,250
You know,
everybody's kind of on the same game.

1000
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:13,940
When you become sedentary,
you can accumulate wealth and so you do 

1001
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:15,240
start seeing these game played out in 
the good way.

1002
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:20,480
You know,
people who have the resources to 

1003
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,311
dedicate themselves to staff other than 
working for a living and so on and in a 

1004
00:46:22,311 --> 00:46:27,021
horrible way.
We told the nastiness that take place 

1005
00:46:27,021 --> 00:46:29,511
over the fighting over.
I want your shade is a little terrier 

1006
00:46:29,511 --> 00:46:30,240
family in order to get what I want.
You know,

1007
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:33,000
so it's,
that's why to me,

1008
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:36,420
when you read those and as usual with 
human beings,

1009
00:46:36,421 --> 00:46:39,030
there's always a good and bad kind of 
logic is you have.

1010
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:40,800
The guys were like,
man,

1011
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:41,330
Petey,
Yoga,

1012
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,260
culture sock.
He was a horrible,

1013
00:46:43,261 --> 00:46:46,690
harsh life where it was terrible and 
every and how can I call it?

1014
00:46:46,691 --> 00:46:49,950
You're a devotee body and states are 
wonderful and all that.

1015
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:55,550
There's an element of truth to that and 
there's also an element that's not and 

1016
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:55,550
vice versa.
The Guy,

1017
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:57,420
White Lis hunters and guides that are 
says the best you once ever,

1018
00:46:57,421 --> 00:47:00,660
and they could do no wrong.
It's like up to a point,

1019
00:47:00,661 --> 00:47:02,310
you know,
even both scenarios,

1020
00:47:02,311 --> 00:47:05,780
there are some huge advantages in some 
huge these advantages.

1021
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:07,740
He just that they change which ones they
are.

1022
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:13,520
Yeah,
when you get so much wealth and so much 

1023
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:17,660
prosperity that you start getting 
royalty when you start getting people 

1024
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:21,630
that accumulate massive amounts of 
wealth and then they have this 

1025
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:25,071
incredible ability to control all the 
people around them and everyone's 

1026
00:47:25,071 --> 00:47:28,371
fearful of them because they have 
ultimate power that can have you killed 

1027
00:47:28,371 --> 00:47:30,250
instantly and face no repercussions.
I was reading

1028
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:35,250
this article about this guy who is some 
Middle Eastern print and he was living 

1029
00:47:35,321 --> 00:47:38,180
in Beverly Hills.
Did you hear about this guy and you want

1030
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:42,840
to do sexually assaulting people that 
worked for him and they arrested him and

1031
00:47:42,841 --> 00:47:45,620
then he fled the country that we gotta 
wait,

1032
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:47,410
wait.
He was saying like,

1033
00:47:47,411 --> 00:47:48,670
you know,
you can't do shit to me.

1034
00:47:48,671 --> 00:47:49,580
I'm a prince,
you know,

1035
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:53,800
and he's like saying that to them like 
was 2016 and he's still like,

1036
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:58,830
I'm a prince.
Should I know that wasn't even one like 

1037
00:47:58,830 --> 00:47:58,830
that.
Fuck,

1038
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:00,640
I wish I remembered the details.
I kind of lost them,

1039
00:48:00,641 --> 00:48:02,350
I think.
I don't want to say.

1040
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:04,090
Well,
there was two of them real recently.

1041
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,890
There was one,
maybe you will remember it,

1042
00:48:05,891 --> 00:48:08,290
but the right.
There was one where to justification was

1043
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:13,350
didn't rape her.
I fail on air and I just had been to 

1044
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:13,350
Bri.

1045
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:17,320
Was that dye penetrate those in the UK 
though?

1046
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:20,160
That was in the UK.
The wars.

1047
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:22,480
The fencing to history.
Like if you can come out,

1048
00:48:22,481 --> 00:48:24,130
let out.
Are we going to defend this guy?

1049
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,560
Let's be Goodi thought like she was 
under age.

1050
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:31,580
Yeah.
You'll get laughed out of the room like 

1051
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:31,580
the defense ever and he got acquitted.
See if you can find that.

1052
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:35,410
He fell on her and how did they acquit 
him?

1053
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,110
They,
whoever was on that jury,

1054
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:43,170
I guess it was a jewelry or whatever.
Who the judges follow that guy forever.

1055
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:47,020
I wouldn't say that their bank accounts 
for somewhere.

1056
00:48:47,021 --> 00:48:49,810
You're going to find a hole in the 
ground where the bag of gold.

1057
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,330
Here it is,
British Manitoba Police.

1058
00:48:52,331 --> 00:48:56,830
He may have penetrated teenager after 
falling on top of her cleared of rape.

1059
00:48:57,310 --> 00:49:02,310
Whoa.
Was a British millionaire who told the 

1060
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:02,310
police may have pantry,
teenager,

1061
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:04,000
director fall on top of,
has been cleared of rape,

1062
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:09,450
a try saying that name as Han Abdulaziz 
was accused of forcing him,

1063
00:49:10,751 --> 00:49:10,990
said,
oh,

1064
00:49:10,991 --> 00:49:15,991
she was 18,
18 as she slept on the Sofa in his 

1065
00:49:15,991 --> 00:49:19,771
Lincoln apartment after a night of 
drinking at an exclusive nightclub when 

1066
00:49:20,141 --> 00:49:25,141
he was questioned,
the 46 year old businessman said he had 

1067
00:49:25,141 --> 00:49:27,961
slipped and fallen on top of the girl,
which may have caused his penis to 

1068
00:49:27,961 --> 00:49:27,961
penetrate her.

1069
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:30,280
I'm fragile.
I fell down,

1070
00:49:30,281 --> 00:49:32,410
but nothing ever happened to me and this
girl,

1071
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:36,870
I'm fragile so I can keep my balance.
You know about a pinnacle,

1072
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:41,890
have great aim because somehow he 
managed to find her vagina with the 

1073
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:45,931
jury,
acquitted him of one count of way rape 

1074
00:49:45,931 --> 00:49:48,520
after just 30 minutes of deliberations.
Wow.

1075
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:52,030
That jury is going to be a tank coon.
Big Time.

1076
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:57,150
They're going to be on a fucking yacht,
Paula to to like a Jay z video doo Doo 

1077
00:49:57,150 --> 00:50:00,480
Doo Doo Doo Doo to to.
Well,

1078
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,070
it's also fear to when someone has that 
kind of thing,

1079
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:09,440
you've got to wonder,
is he a billionaire to say bi or men 

1080
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,080
air?
Well Posey have a billion come on son.

1081
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:15,070
I wonder how how he got away with that.
That doesn't even make any sense.

1082
00:50:15,071 --> 00:50:19,270
Unless they just picked a super 
sympathetic pro Muslim.

1083
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,690
I'm assuming he's Muslim with that name 
pro Muslim,

1084
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,490
but even.
I mean it's like,

1085
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:26,110
come on,
how did they do it?

1086
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,100
Well,
I really think what

1087
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:33,100
you laid out is the value option or I'll
have you killed option are really the 

1088
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:35,000
only two logical explanations because 
other than that,

1089
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:37,130
this is not a defense.
This is the most.

1090
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:40,010
Like this is a late night joke.
First of all,

1091
00:50:40,011 --> 00:50:44,750
look at that guy's fat face and telling 
me that guy keeps a raging erection like

1092
00:50:44,751 --> 00:50:48,050
all the time while he's walking around.
That is not healthy at all.

1093
00:50:48,051 --> 00:50:49,970
You're not 15.
You're not like some.

1094
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,820
Some young boy with a throbbing heart on
that.

1095
00:50:52,821 --> 00:50:57,170
He just like literally it runs his life.
That guy's probably lucky.

1096
00:50:57,171 --> 00:51:00,910
Unless he's on Viagra.
He's lucky if he can get it up here.

1097
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:06,640
Look at him,
it's all fat and swollen like I was not 

1098
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:07,130
healthy enough to have a rod is all the 
time.

1099
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:09,050
Fucking raging.
Boner.

1100
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:11,630
Slipped Hodge.
He's got it in there.

1101
00:51:11,631 --> 00:51:14,510
You like his dick is like a like a heat 
seeking missile.

1102
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:19,560
Just fly finds its way into vaginas.
Only have to do is fall near the girl I 

1103
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,210
in there.
Yeah.

1104
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,950
It's not that easy here but.
But what do you.

1105
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:26,120
You have to work at it.
You have to work at it.

1106
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:28,480
Jury acquitted him.
Well,

1107
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:32,630
yeah.
There's no justice in the world.

1108
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:37,160
If I was at girl's dad or if I was that 
girl or her mom or anybody.

1109
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:39,020
The girl herself.
Yeah.

1110
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:40,360
Find that guy.
Yep.

1111
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:45,850
Well what is she saying?
That he was as she was asleep and he 

1112
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:48,611
just stuck his dick in her while she was
out cold by Zip code and she woke up 

1113
00:51:48,611 --> 00:51:52,230
fucker today my phone inside,
you know,

1114
00:51:52,311 --> 00:51:55,040
big.
Did you imagine the odd.

1115
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:56,870
But imagine if that's really what 
happened.

1116
00:51:56,871 --> 00:52:01,460
Like what if he's like walking on 
hardwood floors a is a wearing socks and

1117
00:52:01,461 --> 00:52:03,650
he steps on a piece of paper and just,
whoops,

1118
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:05,050
she's still wearing anything.

1119
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:11,900
He claimed he had gone to see if the 
young woman wanted a tee shirt to sleep 

1120
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:16,361
in or a taxi home.
But he said she pulled him on top of her

1121
00:52:16,431 --> 00:52:19,940
and placed his hand between her legs.
Oh,

1122
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:23,120
his semen and DNA were found inside the 
young woman.

1123
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:28,300
But he said it was possible that he had 
semen on his hands from having sex with 

1124
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:30,910
a 24 year old earlier.
Um,

1125
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:35,300
we more complicated if you got semen on 
his hands.

1126
00:52:35,301 --> 00:52:36,590
How did he get it?
Inside of her?

1127
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,930
I slipped in my penis.
End.

1128
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:42,500
My hands went inside of her vagina is 
huge.

1129
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:47,770
It's got us.
He's a God like that.

1130
00:52:48,471 --> 00:52:53,471
Don't even make any sense.
The she pulled him on top of her and 

1131
00:52:53,471 --> 00:52:55,340
placed his hand between her legs.
Boy,

1132
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:59,370
that's a squirrely fucking story.
Hmm.

1133
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,810
Early our,
the young woman said she had woken up in

1134
00:53:02,811 --> 00:53:07,811
the early hours of the morning with Mr 
Abdulla Aziz on top of her forcing 

1135
00:53:08,241 --> 00:53:09,590
himself inside of her.

1136
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:13,220
He claimed he'd gotten to see if the 
young woman wanted to tee shirt to sleep

1137
00:53:13,221 --> 00:53:15,560
in or a taxi home.
Okay.

1138
00:53:15,561 --> 00:53:16,700
I believe her.
How about that?

1139
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,640
I think it story sucks.
Well,

1140
00:53:19,641 --> 00:53:22,880
this stories definitely socks about like
slipping and falling into that sucks,

1141
00:53:22,881 --> 00:53:27,881
but it sucks even more.
I've gotten to see if she wanted a t 

1142
00:53:27,881 --> 00:53:29,910
shirt to sleep in or a taxi home.
What a wonderful person you are.

1143
00:53:29,911 --> 00:53:34,911
You are amazing.
Did you also donate some money to a 

1144
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:37,821
charity of your choice?
I was up all night trying to help 

1145
00:53:37,821 --> 00:53:39,300
orphans,
but it Horsley you think,

1146
00:53:39,330 --> 00:53:41,400
how stupid do you have to be to make up 
your story?

1147
00:53:41,401 --> 00:53:43,050
Because you can say you can throw it 
into a.

1148
00:53:43,051 --> 00:53:44,650
He said she said kind of thing.
No,

1149
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:45,810
it must consent in Charlotte.
No,

1150
00:53:45,811 --> 00:53:46,590
he wasn't.
You know.

1151
00:53:46,591 --> 00:53:47,950
Then it's harder world,
right?

1152
00:53:47,951 --> 00:53:49,140
There's an article there.

1153
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,230
This is like the most fucking ridiculous
story ever.

1154
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:53,800
How did you even sit down and say,
no,

1155
00:53:53,801 --> 00:53:55,400
no,
I'm not going to go for the sexuality.

1156
00:53:55,430 --> 00:53:59,400
They've got to recap this crazy weird 
estela like he make no sense.

1157
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:04,430
Meanwhile,
he's free right now with his feet up on 

1158
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:04,950
the coffee table,
smoking a Cuban cigar,

1159
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:08,460
laughing.
Probably getting his dick sucked by some

1160
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:14,780
Russian hooker.
That's probably why the first few 

1161
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:17,121
seasons stuff that backs there were so 
popular right before they fuck they 

1162
00:54:17,121 --> 00:54:17,121
thought,
but buddy was still a good show.

1163
00:54:17,121 --> 00:54:19,710
First season was awesome because 
everybody's got their thing right.

1164
00:54:19,711 --> 00:54:24,711
There are so much nasty sheet that has 
been in the ward with no repercussions 

1165
00:54:24,711 --> 00:54:24,840
that everybody's got the fan.
Does he off?

1166
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:26,670
Fuck you.
I'm going to get you.

1167
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,230
Boy,
did they fuck that show up?

1168
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:33,530
They took that.
That show was like a work of art that 

1169
00:54:33,530 --> 00:54:36,530
the writers from murder,
she wrote got a hold of and they just 

1170
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:36,530
started.

1171
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:40,210
Just shitting in the mouth of every 
character became awful.

1172
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,650
It was awful.
I was so bad.

1173
00:54:43,651 --> 00:54:44,730
People kept telling me,
no,

1174
00:54:44,731 --> 00:54:45,870
no,
you got to give it a chance.

1175
00:54:45,871 --> 00:54:47,670
It gets better.
Fuck you.

1176
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:49,890
I don't have that kind of time in my 
life,

1177
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,800
you know,
masochistic effort.

1178
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:55,480
I stuck through it.
All I've seen is on the.

1179
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:58,680
I didn't know,
get that idea and I think,

1180
00:54:58,681 --> 00:54:59,400
you know,
you got,

1181
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:01,380
you've got second team because you got 
the first three,

1182
00:55:01,390 --> 00:55:01,880
four,
five,

1183
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:03,500
whatever many sees on the first few are 
good,

1184
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,860
right?
And did like three,

1185
00:55:04,861 --> 00:55:06,320
four more than that.
Really not.

1186
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:07,620
And,
but you're like,

1187
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:09,440
no,
but maybe they'll get the next one,

1188
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:10,270
right.
Was like,

1189
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:12,030
yeah,
that didn't all that.

1190
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:13,620
Um,
and I,

1191
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:16,620
I,
I really didn't realize what it was when

1192
00:55:16,621 --> 00:55:18,450
it first came out,
but it hadn't really changed.

1193
00:55:18,451 --> 00:55:20,460
Was the first episode of the Sopranos.

1194
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:22,850
It was a comedy.
It was.

1195
00:55:23,310 --> 00:55:23,970
Well,
I mean,

1196
00:55:23,971 --> 00:55:25,120
yeah,
we are way.

1197
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:30,140
But yeah,
there was a lot of comedic element for 

1198
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:31,911
sure.
Like when the woman had the machine gun 

1199
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:34,670
and she ran outside with the AK 47,
the wife like that was so out of 

1200
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:36,300
character,
like who she became later in the show.

1201
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:39,720
Like that episode was like,
it was preposterous.

1202
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:40,800
Gang,
family,

1203
00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:41,910
you know,
mom,

1204
00:55:41,911 --> 00:55:42,960
family.
It was weird.

1205
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:45,180
But even though they have some moments 
in there,

1206
00:55:45,181 --> 00:55:46,890
like I don't remember,
even at the end of season one where they

1207
00:55:46,891 --> 00:55:51,891
are chasing these do through the woods 
to shoot him and the dude is like 

1208
00:55:51,891 --> 00:55:51,891
screaming all of a sudden one and 
definitely he's like,

1209
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:52,800
you got shot that.
He's like,

1210
00:55:52,801 --> 00:55:55,090
no,
fuck poison ivy at his old piece of golf

1211
00:55:55,110 --> 00:56:00,110
about that.
And it's like they throw in these weird 

1212
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:00,110
data bits to make it.
He goes,

1213
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:00,330
it doesn't really well or eat them.
Yeah.

1214
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:05,360
It was definitely really well written 
and it got better as it got darker and 

1215
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:08,970
weirder got better.
That was one of the few shows ever where

1216
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:14,030
they figured out a way for you to feel 
sympathetic about a murderer because 

1217
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:17,280
Tony Soprano wasn't a murderer.
He killed him.

1218
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:18,260
You liked him?
Huh?

1219
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:22,250
Should I even add the height?
Remember having nightmare self shit.

1220
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:23,980
The FBI trying to get me.
I

1221
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,830
have to hide the stuff I was.
Because you relate to the guy.

1222
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:31,940
At least I did feel.
I felt like it's a fucking exited 

1223
00:56:32,550 --> 00:56:34,570
heritage.
Your last name as well.

1224
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:38,200
But it was a dark time for Italian 
American.

1225
00:56:38,201 --> 00:56:43,150
So because everybody wanted to be like,
connected to the mob was really dumb.

1226
00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:44,560
East Coast Guineas,
we're like,

1227
00:56:44,561 --> 00:56:48,290
so celebrate Tori and they were upping 
older Guinness.

1228
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:53,680
That's painful.
They would crank it up to a 10 guy with 

1229
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:56,420
the thing and the goes like,
hey,

1230
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:01,440
blamed the sopranos for Jersey Shore.
I think that was a direct connection 

1231
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:01,960
there.
I think you have a point.

1232
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:04,240
Yeah.
In the real housewives of Jersey,

1233
00:57:04,241 --> 00:57:06,670
which is the most disgusting version of 
real housewives.

1234
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:10,120
Real housewives of Miami.
They should just give them knives.

1235
00:57:10,450 --> 00:57:12,850
They just give those bitches knives and 
let them cut each other.

1236
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:17,200
Was a fucking savages.
But jerseys the grossest.

1237
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:18,140
And then,
uh,

1238
00:57:18,190 --> 00:57:21,700
now that one family,
the woman's in jail and she's doing time

1239
00:57:21,701 --> 00:57:26,701
and then she gets out,
the husband's got to go in because only 

1240
00:57:26,701 --> 00:57:27,160
one can stay out and watch the kids.
So they take turns.

1241
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:32,210
Yeah.
They take turns like a tax evasion 

1242
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:32,210
thing,
right?

1243
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:33,280
High five each other on the way you net 
out is like,

1244
00:57:33,281 --> 00:57:34,180
okay,
you're recording now.

1245
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:36,130
Go.
I'm in favor of people going to jail for

1246
00:57:36,131 --> 00:57:37,210
stealing things.
But man,

1247
00:57:37,211 --> 00:57:42,211
that tax evasion thing is a tricky one.
How about you just fucking pay what you 

1248
00:57:42,211 --> 00:57:42,670
owe?
How come?

1249
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:48,030
How come?
It's the only time when you owe 

1250
00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:48,030
something,
you'd go to jail,

1251
00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:48,040
like fuel credit card money.
You have to pay it,

1252
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:50,290
right?
You know you owe student loan money.

1253
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:52,090
You have to pay it.
You owe taxes,

1254
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:54,780
go to jail,
bitch block you in a cage.

1255
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:55,330
That's nuts.

1256
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:57,710
Gangster.
You know they are the big gangster.

1257
00:57:57,730 --> 00:58:02,730
That's what I mean.
That's exactly what I was saying about 

1258
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:02,950
sort of mafia and government's been 
identity cut the same shit.

1259
00:58:03,090 --> 00:58:08,090
I mean even like the Mafia.
It's funny because a lot of the early 

1260
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:09,010
mafia stuff came up as a form of 
government.

1261
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:10,260
You know,
when like in the south,

1262
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:15,270
they're neat that he went,
God invaded by dishpan yards by the 

1263
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:17,660
French.
So the government was not on the 

1264
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:17,660
people's side.
They were a occupying force,

1265
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,500
trying to squeeze as much wealth out of 
the country as possible.

1266
00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:23,260
So because they couldn't turn to the 
government,

1267
00:58:23,261 --> 00:58:25,090
a lot of the people started turning into
these,

1268
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,700
made up local organization,
which eventually,

1269
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:31,360
because they provide all these services,
but they are also the mafia,

1270
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:36,410
you know,
they do instill deal with teaching 

1271
00:58:36,410 --> 00:58:39,130
staff.
You can see the logic why besides 

1272
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:39,190
academia now that element,
the 90 devolves completely into Jessica.

1273
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:40,990
You mean apply them into nothing goes.
But he's like,

1274
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:42,400
there's no way,
you know,

1275
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:45,850
there's a logic to it and it's immediate
versus state university level,

1276
00:58:45,851 --> 00:58:50,851
you know,
the hierarchy of the way they handle 

1277
00:58:50,851 --> 00:58:50,851
these nice,
you know,

1278
00:58:50,851 --> 00:58:51,610
the whole thing gives me an alert on the
state.

1279
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:56,880
Yeah.
And if you look at the amount of 

1280
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:57,760
atrocities committed per capita,
I mean it's probably pretty similar.

1281
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,160
I mean the mafia does some awful shit 
but.

1282
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:01,610
So government.
Yeah.

1283
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:07,100
So does the military.
So I mean think about the amount of 

1284
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:10,560
innocent people that are accidentally 
killed everyday during military.

1285
00:59:11,630 --> 00:59:16,630
No,
that's why you need to be a war to call 

1286
00:59:16,630 --> 00:59:19,570
and quit or worse or the mafia bosses.
That's why those stories are the same 

1287
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:23,131
thing.
It's about the guy struggling for power 

1288
00:59:23,131 --> 00:59:23,131
against 80.
I mean

1289
00:59:23,131 --> 00:59:23,690
the same thing over and over,
you know,

1290
00:59:23,691 --> 00:59:25,250
it's uh,
yeah.

1291
00:59:25,251 --> 00:59:30,251
The,
the mafia has its ancient system of 

1292
00:59:30,251 --> 00:59:31,100
government and laws and rules and you 
know,

1293
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:36,190
so to the sandinistas the contras.
So does you know the so did you can go 

1294
00:59:37,401 --> 00:59:39,140
down the line.
So to gangas conduit.

1295
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:44,200
So did Alexander the Great.
They all had their own sort of systems 

1296
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:45,200
of government and rules that you had to 
live by.

1297
00:59:45,201 --> 00:59:48,630
And speaking of getting gas gun,
did you check out the show Marco Polo?

1298
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:49,610
Yes.
It's good.

1299
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:50,960
I liked it.
It's a good show.

1300
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:53,390
Yeah.
They didn't finish it and they hate it,

1301
00:59:53,391 --> 00:59:56,290
but equal that I know they did like a 
half hour on the bad ass.

1302
00:59:56,370 --> 00:59:57,720
That waste among.
Yeah.

1303
00:59:57,950 --> 00:59:58,730
Pretty cool.
Right?

1304
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:00,810
Doug?
It's well written.

1305
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:02,300
It's a,
it's good stuff.

1306
01:00:02,301 --> 01:00:04,580
It's a very expensive show apparently.
He said yeah,

1307
01:00:04,581 --> 01:00:09,581
because they're,
the sets are massive and they make it 

1308
01:00:09,581 --> 01:00:11,150
look like the,
the Mongol era,

1309
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:12,690
like 1200.

1310
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:17,700
So they don't kind of sell it for money 
because you know what kind of stuff for 

1311
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:20,951
money to kill me.
My probably my favorite tool for the 

1312
01:00:20,951 --> 01:00:20,951
times.
Have you ever seen that Oma?

1313
01:00:20,951 --> 01:00:22,280
Be One.
Oh No.

1314
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:25,220
That was so good.
It wasn't really an amazing,

1315
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:29,390
brilliant instruction at trait bits 
about it.

1316
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:33,200
I don't know.
It was back when was it 2004 or five,

1317
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:34,880
something like that wasn't that long 
ago.

1318
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:37,220
It was a while back,
but they only did two seasons,

1319
01:00:37,221 --> 01:00:41,150
but they are fucking awesome.
Like I watched every season twice,

1320
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:43,550
so maybe even more.
It was that good.

1321
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,820
The main character,
um,

1322
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:50,330
he's pretty much a variational call and,
and it's so cool.

1323
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:51,950
The,
oddly enough,

1324
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:56,980
the guy who created the show was Jamil 
Lewis was the guy with directed the 

1325
01:00:56,980 --> 01:01:00,521
first call and I was,
the guy was behind a part of the 

1326
01:01:00,521 --> 01:01:00,650
creative directing of the early UFC.

1327
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:02,780
He's the guy who wrote the apocalypse 
now.

1328
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:07,280
He standing so many of the sinks side 
dig and by.

1329
01:01:07,281 --> 01:01:08,840
Yeah,
that's your money if you have never seen

1330
01:01:08,841 --> 01:01:09,560
it,
check it out.

1331
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:14,590
I mean today looks tame by comparison 
cause so much stuff has been done 

1332
01:01:14,590 --> 01:01:16,710
afterwards.
That's just dates a 10 notice before the

1333
01:01:16,711 --> 01:01:21,711
time he was over 18 times with nudity 
and violence and the grittiness of it 

1334
01:01:21,711 --> 01:01:22,520
all.
It's a.

1335
01:01:22,610 --> 01:01:27,610
it's an awesome trauma.
So it sort of opened the door maybe for 

1336
01:01:27,610 --> 01:01:27,610
things like game of thrones,
bake time,

1337
01:01:27,610 --> 01:01:27,990
big,
big.

1338
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:30,170
That's funny how a show like that didn't
catch on,

1339
01:01:30,171 --> 01:01:31,910
but a show like game of thrones does,
you know,

1340
01:01:31,911 --> 01:01:36,911
or soprano's does.
I think what he was is it almost 

1341
01:01:36,911 --> 01:01:38,300
actually doing fairly well but not well 
enough for the budget.

1342
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,330
I think the budget was too inflated 
compared to the results.

1343
01:01:41,331 --> 01:01:42,050
The results are good.

1344
01:01:42,050 --> 01:01:42,980
You know,
people liked it.

1345
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:46,670
The critical reviews or to create an 
audience you know is good,

1346
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:49,600
but you know the Sopranos,
you shoot somebody silos,

1347
01:01:49,601 --> 01:01:52,130
you know the budget is not going to be 
what you have to recreate.

1348
01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:57,140
Ancient Rome when I could and scale.
It's a different kind of game right 

1349
01:01:57,140 --> 01:01:57,140
there.
So Hbo,

1350
01:01:57,140 --> 01:02:00,470
I think he wasn't that old tanking is 
this show is doing well,

1351
01:02:00,471 --> 01:02:05,471
but it cost too much fucking money.
Those shows they didn't have the option 

1352
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:08,720
of selling them on itunes back then.
Did they know exactly what 2004?

1353
01:02:08,721 --> 01:02:11,390
Did they have itunes back then?
They kinda did.

1354
01:02:11,391 --> 01:02:16,391
Right.
I want to say that even dad would have 

1355
01:02:16,391 --> 01:02:18,050
been said much the early stages that 
isn't that crazy fucking 10 years ago.

1356
01:02:18,051 --> 01:02:20,130
I know,
but it's another universe completely.

1357
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:22,650
It might as well be with everything,
with social media,

1358
01:02:22,651 --> 01:02:23,630
with everything.
That's another,

1359
01:02:23,770 --> 01:02:27,000
a whole nother universe.
How many podcasts were around back then?

1360
01:02:29,130 --> 01:02:31,480
Was there like a few people's 30 fucking
with data,

1361
01:02:31,490 --> 01:02:34,110
but nothing got a big scale yet.
It's probably something.

1362
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:38,700
There's probably something.
This podcast has been around since,

1363
01:02:38,701 --> 01:02:41,010
um,
for six years.

1364
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:44,550
So since 2009.
Nine slash nine.

1365
01:02:44,551 --> 01:02:49,551
10 somewhere around then I think.
I think we do and we were doing it in 

1366
01:02:49,551 --> 01:02:50,520
December of 2009,
so right before 2010.

1367
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:54,000
Well,
I'm sure when you started podcasting,

1368
01:02:54,001 --> 01:02:56,610
Ward was a fraction of what it is today.
Yeah,

1369
01:02:56,611 --> 01:02:57,960
it was real small.
So it's,

1370
01:02:58,010 --> 01:02:59,810
um,
Adam Carolla had one.

1371
01:03:00,050 --> 01:03:02,610
Um,
and there was a few other ones.

1372
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:07,020
You know,
Adam Curry had one of the first ones and

1373
01:03:07,021 --> 01:03:09,220
John Devork.
Uh,

1374
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:10,950
but I,
I didn't know about them.

1375
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:16,250
I didn't download them back then.
I got the inspiration to do mine from 

1376
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:20,510
Anthony because Anthony Kumina from opie
and anthony had this set up in his 

1377
01:03:20,510 --> 01:03:21,590
basement where,
uh,

1378
01:03:21,650 --> 01:03:26,650
you know,
he had a lot of money and he had a cool 

1379
01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:26,650
house.

1380
01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:28,800
He live by himself,
so he put up a green screen and set up a

1381
01:03:28,801 --> 01:03:33,801
stage where he had a nice desk and some 
real professional cameras and started 

1382
01:03:34,351 --> 01:03:39,351
doing this thing called live from the 
compound and live from the compound was 

1383
01:03:39,351 --> 01:03:43,461
like his own little fuck around,
have some fun at home show we had like 

1384
01:03:43,461 --> 01:03:44,460
Guinness on tap and he would just drink 
and talk shit.

1385
01:03:44,461 --> 01:03:46,890
And it was really fun to watch and I 
realized it was like,

1386
01:03:46,891 --> 01:03:49,770
wow,
here's a guy that's on serious,

1387
01:03:49,771 --> 01:03:50,640
you know,
he's on the opening.

1388
01:03:50,641 --> 01:03:55,641
Anthony showed it's very popular show on
Sirius and he's decided just for fun to 

1389
01:03:55,651 --> 01:03:58,150
do this thing in his basement that's not
making any money from it.

1390
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:01,290
It's just for fun.
And I thought about it and I said,

1391
01:04:01,291 --> 01:04:03,870
you know what,
I could probably do something like that.

1392
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:08,940
And so we started doing it off of,
I'm just ustream just sitting there with

1393
01:04:08,941 --> 01:04:11,030
a laptop talking shit that's.

1394
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:16,460
So my podcast didn't become a like an 
itunes podcast for like a few months 

1395
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:21,081
after the first one.
We realized once we started collecting 

1396
01:04:21,081 --> 01:04:21,750
and we then took the audio and start 
putting it up on itunes.

1397
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:25,320
But there wasn't that much going on back
then.

1398
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:26,530
And then,
um,

1399
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:28,770
we got it in like right at the right 
time.

1400
01:04:29,370 --> 01:04:34,370
And then like in the next few years,
other comics started starting their own 

1401
01:04:34,591 --> 01:04:36,040
podcast,
you know,

1402
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:37,590
and then everybody,
you know,

1403
01:04:37,591 --> 01:04:40,770
all these different people,
Bill Burr and you know,

1404
01:04:40,771 --> 01:04:43,340
and Dheas and Dunkin and everybody else 
started,

1405
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:45,120
you know,
doing podcasts as well.

1406
01:04:45,121 --> 01:04:49,260
And they all took off.
Well you are single handedly responsible

1407
01:04:49,261 --> 01:04:52,290
for like the [inaudible],
like there are so many podcasts that are

1408
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:54,330
people who came through your show and 
then went,

1409
01:04:54,331 --> 01:04:55,650
Huh,
I should the one,

1410
01:04:55,680 --> 01:05:00,680
you know,
there's like a long list of people with 

1411
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:00,680
a few.
Yeah.

1412
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:02,000
I try to help him to.
I want them to do podcast.

1413
01:05:02,010 --> 01:05:07,010
I just think it's the best form of if,
if you're a comic is the best form of 

1414
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:09,560
expression where you can.
You could just,

1415
01:05:09,690 --> 01:05:12,180
you just talk to people,
get to know the actual.

1416
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:17,210
You like 100 percent with you for three 
hours or it is when you do

1417
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:22,150
yours over the course of 700 and now 
we're like 7:50,

1418
01:05:22,151 --> 01:05:26,710
something 7:55,
755 podcast.

1419
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:31,120
Most of them intoxicated.
Good percentage of them.

1420
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:32,880
I know.
I've seen that lately though.

1421
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:36,340
It hasn't happened as much intoxication,
buddy.

1422
01:05:36,870 --> 01:05:41,870
You,
there's some conversations you can't 

1423
01:05:41,870 --> 01:05:42,140
have toxic.
She will just scatterbrained.

1424
01:05:42,590 --> 01:05:47,590
I didn't want to talk about smurfs are 
fucking the edy's or something in the 

1425
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:50,980
middle of someone talking about the 
economy or bit coin I feel there.

1426
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,420
There's some that lend itself to it and 
some that don't.

1427
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:58,240
It's really completely dependent upon 
the guests.

1428
01:05:58,540 --> 01:06:02,170
What the subject is and I like to mix it
up too.

1429
01:06:02,410 --> 01:06:04,720
You know,
that's the thing about being a marijuana

1430
01:06:04,721 --> 01:06:09,721
enthusiasts unless you're like a Doug 
Benson Kinda guy who everybody just 

1431
01:06:09,721 --> 01:06:12,790
assumes is high 24 slash seven because 
that's kind of a shtick,

1432
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:15,850
you know,
like even the name of his podcast,

1433
01:06:15,851 --> 01:06:17,310
getting doug with high,
like,

1434
01:06:18,270 --> 01:06:18,790
let me get it.

1435
01:06:18,790 --> 01:06:20,230
You can't see,
you can't speak,

1436
01:06:21,130 --> 01:06:23,020
you know what I mean?
I,

1437
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:25,450
you know,
I don't think Pi,

1438
01:06:25,490 --> 01:06:30,490
I think he's like everything else.
It shouldn't be all the time for 

1439
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:30,490
everything.
Yeah.

1440
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:30,610
Everything.
Yeah,

1441
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:35,820
it's a car.
It could be a crutch and it's not a 

1442
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:35,820
crutch,
you know,

1443
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:37,540
it's um,
it's a fun,

1444
01:06:37,870 --> 01:06:42,870
beautiful aspect of nature and a great 
way to perturb your normal states of 

1445
01:06:43,001 --> 01:06:46,630
consciousness and give you some unique 
insight and yeah,

1446
01:06:46,631 --> 01:06:48,670
it's a lot of benefits.
It makes you feel good.

1447
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:52,360
It makes you enjoy wine and make.
It makes me like very friendly,

1448
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:55,280
like pot makes me want to hug people and
they'll tell you,

1449
01:06:55,610 --> 01:07:00,160
you know,
but I just think you should be cool with

1450
01:07:00,161 --> 01:07:02,340
just life.
I'm a big fan,

1451
01:07:02,350 --> 01:07:07,350
so I have to say I'm a huge fan of the 
effect that has on female sexuality the 

1452
01:07:08,051 --> 01:07:10,060
way,
at least in my experience,

1453
01:07:10,061 --> 01:07:12,500
women that respond to weed wouldn't 
call.

1454
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:13,710
The good ones do.
Yeah.

1455
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:18,750
My best ally ever.
It's definitely you feel like a god 

1456
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:18,750
you've touched.
Have multiple.

1457
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:21,910
Oregon's somebody up like that was easy.
That didn't think much.

1458
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,530
Will it?
Makes hugs feel good?

1459
01:07:23,590 --> 01:07:24,550
Yes.
Just hugs.

1460
01:07:24,551 --> 01:07:26,410
Forget about sex.
Just smoke weed and hug.

1461
01:07:26,890 --> 01:07:29,320
It feels amazing.
You know you ever done ecstasy?

1462
01:07:29,770 --> 01:07:30,790
No.
No.

1463
01:07:30,850 --> 01:07:33,310
It's been on my to do list,
but I've had a.

1464
01:07:33,370 --> 01:07:38,370
You could hold hands with dude.
When you're on ecstasy and you feel bad 

1465
01:07:38,370 --> 01:07:38,370
at all,
are you going to do it?

1466
01:07:38,370 --> 01:07:42,621
Can Be rubbing each others hands.
Does it feel bad at all ever fucked one 

1467
01:07:43,421 --> 01:07:44,400
thing that it does.
It's,

1468
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:47,920
it's fucking terrible for your brain.
At least I should qualify that.

1469
01:07:47,921 --> 01:07:52,610
That was when I did it.
I probably did a little too much and uh,

1470
01:07:52,611 --> 01:07:54,580
the next day I just was so fucking 
stupid.

1471
01:07:54,581 --> 01:07:59,581
Now my brain didn't work good.
I've talked to many people who don't 

1472
01:07:59,581 --> 01:08:02,581
have that problem,
but they don't have to do the same sort 

1473
01:08:02,581 --> 01:08:03,280
of things with their brain that I have 
to do.

1474
01:08:03,550 --> 01:08:05,410
So it's,
it depends on what you do,

1475
01:08:05,411 --> 01:08:10,411
like if you go to work and you have a 
normal job and you don't have to do 

1476
01:08:10,411 --> 01:08:10,411
anything important and maybe you know,
great,

1477
01:08:10,690 --> 01:08:15,690
maybe it's fine,
but if you're a person who has to think 

1478
01:08:15,690 --> 01:08:16,220
for a living and you have to do like 
stand up comedy

1479
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:19,630
on stage or you have to write or the 
podcast or something like that.

1480
01:08:19,631 --> 01:08:23,150
Like I couldn't imagine doing ecstasy 
and then doing the UFC the next day.

1481
01:08:23,210 --> 01:08:24,050
Yeah,
that would be a rough.

1482
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:25,310
I,
I wouldn't be able to do it.

1483
01:08:25,370 --> 01:08:27,620
That kind of the whole theory that there
are these,

1484
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:33,400
I don't know what Saturday are,
but that you take after you take 

1485
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:33,400
ecstasy.
HTP,

1486
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:36,410
is that what it takes that allow you not
to have the Dow and thereafter words?

1487
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,080
I've never done it.
Um,

1488
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:39,830
but I would imagine,
you know,

1489
01:08:40,130 --> 01:08:42,320
like I said,
only did actually once in the one I did.

1490
01:08:42,321 --> 01:08:45,200
I just totally did it naturally.
But I do take five htp,

1491
01:08:45,201 --> 01:08:48,670
I take new mood,
which is five htp and l trip to fan.

1492
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:50,220
That stuff definitely works.
Hey.

1493
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:54,620
But I've never done it in conjunction 
with that with acid but,

1494
01:08:54,650 --> 01:08:56,420
or with molly or ecstasy.

1495
01:08:56,480 --> 01:09:00,470
But actually that's how it got invented.
That's how new mood got invented.

1496
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:04,190
Really trying to figure out a way to 
mitigate partying.

1497
01:09:04,930 --> 01:09:09,930
I love,
I mean that's just as it was called roll

1498
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:15,940
off did the other day and she had these 
old perfect scheme for basically every 

1499
01:09:17,171 --> 01:09:20,580
legal prostitution by using a loophole 
that,

1500
01:09:20,581 --> 01:09:21,500
you know,
if there's a cabinet,

1501
01:09:21,501 --> 01:09:23,580
our role in that.
It's part is not the restitution.

1502
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:25,910
That was true.
It was true.

1503
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:29,210
I at even sign a contract,
you could hire someone,

1504
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:31,250
sign a contract to,
uh,

1505
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:31,850
to have,
uh,

1506
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:34,880
a porn film and even just for your own 
benefit,

1507
01:09:35,090 --> 01:09:37,010
you could have it for yourself as long 
as you're filming.

1508
01:09:37,110 --> 01:09:38,450
Right.
That's hilarious.

1509
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:39,980
It's so stupid.
But yeah,

1510
01:09:39,981 --> 01:09:40,660
I love the way.
Oh,

1511
01:09:40,661 --> 01:09:45,661
but it's brain work,
but he's not the only one that stopped 

1512
01:09:45,661 --> 01:09:45,661
that.
I'm sure.

1513
01:09:45,661 --> 01:09:45,661
I'm sure.
But it's still,

1514
01:09:45,661 --> 01:09:47,510
the porn loophole is how,
um,

1515
01:09:47,780 --> 01:09:52,780
like porn stars get away with doing 
quote unquote prostitution like that.

1516
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:57,900
There was a girl that was at the comedy 
store and she was telling guys that you 

1517
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:59,060
could fuck her,
but you have to pay her her rate and you

1518
01:09:59,061 --> 01:10:00,130
have to turn a camera on.
Yep.

1519
01:10:00,950 --> 01:10:02,600
And she's like,
I'm not a hooker.

1520
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:03,350
I'm like,
okay.

1521
01:10:03,570 --> 01:10:05,030
I don't even know what to say.
I gotta go.

1522
01:10:07,090 --> 01:10:08,990
I don't know.
I would have entertained that cover sick

1523
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,230
before ally.
Yeah.

1524
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:11,870
It was getting ugly.
It was getting.

1525
01:10:11,970 --> 01:10:13,440
I think she had this dude with her.
I'm like,

1526
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:14,520
how does he fit?
Yeah,

1527
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:17,020
that pitch.
Well,

1528
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:19,430
he was like,
I didn't know if he was the boyfriend or

1529
01:10:19,431 --> 01:10:20,690
if he's the pimp,
but he was right.

1530
01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:22,040
He didn't.
I mean,

1531
01:10:22,041 --> 01:10:27,041
unless he had a gun,
I don't know how he's going to protect 

1532
01:10:27,041 --> 01:10:27,041
her.
It was very strange.

1533
01:10:27,041 --> 01:10:31,840
But that's the comedy store.
How many stores have vortex of strange 

1534
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:35,740
somehow or another,
it just drags those people to that one 

1535
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:38,240
place that I sat in the rainbow.
You ever go to the rainbow bar and grill

1536
01:10:38,450 --> 01:10:41,600
as the place where they.
When Lemmy died from motorhead,

1537
01:10:41,630 --> 01:10:43,700
they saved a seat for him.
Oh,

1538
01:10:43,950 --> 01:10:46,290
I'll have a seat that's permanently 
reserved and I'm like,

1539
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:48,760
yeah,
it's permanently reserved.

1540
01:10:48,780 --> 01:10:50,210
I like it a place to.
Let me see.

1541
01:10:50,450 --> 01:10:52,370
Yeah,
they have candles there and shit.

1542
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:55,490
Like maybe if one of his band members 
comes there and they're all sold out,

1543
01:10:55,491 --> 01:10:56,900
they'll let them sit there.
Maybe.

1544
01:10:58,270 --> 01:11:03,270
Maybe not.
Maybe you have to be like Lenny's 

1545
01:11:03,270 --> 01:11:03,270
friends if friends and they want to sit 
at a table.

1546
01:11:03,270 --> 01:11:04,730
I think that's,
that should fly.

1547
01:11:05,030 --> 01:11:06,200
That's okay.
You know,

1548
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:10,970
I think I can see a different factual is
going to war over it.

1549
01:11:10,971 --> 01:11:11,570
He's like,
nope,

1550
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,730
this is for Lamean.
Motherfucker can all do it.

1551
01:11:13,910 --> 01:11:15,120
And the other guys being like,
yes,

1552
01:11:15,121 --> 01:11:16,680
this friends.
Come on,

1553
01:11:16,681 --> 01:11:18,390
you can do it.
Yeah.

1554
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:19,660
Yeah.
That's,

1555
01:11:20,010 --> 01:11:22,710
I would religious warfare begins.
That is.

1556
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:25,200
Yeah,
right.

1557
01:11:25,230 --> 01:11:27,600
Like sacred.
Anything sacred,

1558
01:11:27,870 --> 01:11:29,760
sacred grounds,
sacred places.

1559
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:31,840
Sacred.
The word.

1560
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,830
Just this sacred things.
There's good and bad in them.

1561
01:11:34,831 --> 01:11:35,290
There's like,
there's,

1562
01:11:35,330 --> 01:11:37,710
there's definitely merit in sacred 
things,

1563
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:42,600
but you know,
like there's an area in Hawaii where the

1564
01:11:42,601 --> 01:11:47,220
Keck observatory is and they wanted to 
construct a larger,

1565
01:11:47,221 --> 01:11:52,221
bigger telescope and apparently they 
have problems because the native 

1566
01:11:52,221 --> 01:11:53,730
American,
I guess I native American Hawaiian,

1567
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:55,790
they're sort of native Americans,
Hawaiians,

1568
01:11:56,400 --> 01:12:01,400
um,
the people that lived there have some 

1569
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:02,510
sacred ground up there that they don't 
think that you're supposed to build on,

1570
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:03,360
which,
you know,

1571
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:04,080
I get it.

1572
01:12:04,750 --> 01:12:06,090
It's their spot,
you know,

1573
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:08,610
false on some assholes come up there 
with a telescope.

1574
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:10,050
Yep.
I got that.

1575
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:12,240
Have you ever been up there to the Keck 
observatory?

1576
01:12:12,340 --> 01:12:14,870
Not that I want.
You have been to the big island a no.

1577
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:17,460
Be normally to Maui big island is 
awesome.

1578
01:12:17,490 --> 01:12:20,490
It's so strange because it's the biggest
of the islands,

1579
01:12:20,790 --> 01:12:23,580
but it's the least populated of the 
Hawaiian islands duct.

1580
01:12:23,660 --> 01:12:26,850
It's,
and it's also one where it has all these

1581
01:12:26,851 --> 01:12:31,851
different ecosystems on one island,
like if you go like near the Hilo side 

1582
01:12:31,851 --> 01:12:35,380
where Bj Penn's from,
it's all like tropical beautiful God.

1583
01:12:35,381 --> 01:12:38,610
It rains all the time and it's lush and 
green.

1584
01:12:38,611 --> 01:12:42,270
It's magical.
But then you go to like the other side,

1585
01:12:42,450 --> 01:12:47,090
like the Kona side and it's like,
it's totally different.

1586
01:12:47,140 --> 01:12:52,140
It's drier and then there's areas that 
have these giant lava beds and it's up 

1587
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:54,120
to the tape to hold the whole place is 
amazing.

1588
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:55,560
Even seemed the lava beds.
Yeah,

1589
01:12:55,770 --> 01:13:00,770
I've seen.
I've seen some pretty crazy shit on the 

1590
01:13:00,770 --> 01:13:03,291
whole.
I don't know why he's one with this 

1591
01:13:03,291 --> 01:13:03,291
place.
This is kind of a nice steady.

1592
01:13:03,291 --> 01:13:03,291
That is even part of the US because he's
going to be the love,

1593
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:08,040
the fucking pissing people off anything.
But it's a beautiful place.

1594
01:13:08,041 --> 01:13:09,720
I can see how you want to.
Well,

1595
01:13:09,721 --> 01:13:14,721
how about Alaska?
You have to fly through Canada gets 

1596
01:13:14,721 --> 01:13:14,721
elected.
It was bizarre.

1597
01:13:14,721 --> 01:13:15,390
Except frozen Puerto Rico.
Yeah.

1598
01:13:16,820 --> 01:13:20,310
It doesn't make any sense.
That's the APP right there.

1599
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:23,820
The I'm nobody to think you are saying 
about the sake of it.

1600
01:13:23,821 --> 01:13:28,821
And to me it seemed interesting because 
precisely because you hold something 

1601
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:33,321
sacred to me.
You need to be able to have more to 

1602
01:13:33,321 --> 01:13:35,170
laugh to not because you diminish its 
importance.

1603
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:38,880
He dirt to avoid fucking up and throw an
18 to a dogma.

1604
01:13:38,970 --> 01:13:43,970
You know the one theme that keeps things
loose like you speaking of American 

1605
01:13:43,970 --> 01:13:47,811
Indian stuff is bad twat at the.
I remember being like at some Lakota 

1606
01:13:47,811 --> 01:13:47,811
ceremonies wedding,
was he liar.

1607
01:13:47,811 --> 01:13:52,571
He was to see people who have grown app 
with dates so far damaged that he other 

1608
01:13:52,571 --> 01:13:55,471
thing versus like some white guys were 
coming up and then they will find out 

1609
01:13:55,471 --> 01:13:57,260
about.
He supposed to be right as he ladders.

1610
01:13:57,270 --> 01:13:58,980
That was during the break of the 
ceremony.

1611
01:13:58,981 --> 01:14:03,981
They were giving some of the Sunday and 
of giving bikes to settle with the 

1612
01:14:03,981 --> 01:14:06,630
people we're supporting their right and 
these guys were taking the pipe.

1613
01:14:06,690 --> 01:14:11,690
They will smoke it,
they will pass it to other people and 

1614
01:14:11,690 --> 01:14:11,980
they gave it to this white lady was 
clearly

1615
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:13,970
ticket ourselves real seriously.
Right.

1616
01:14:13,971 --> 01:14:17,450
And so she's tried to like the five but 
she can that she feels she failed.

1617
01:14:17,451 --> 01:14:22,130
So she thrived and then taking herself 
superseded he or she takes a deep breath

1618
01:14:22,131 --> 01:14:23,260
and she goes,
oh,

1619
01:14:24,370 --> 01:14:27,370
the spirit's the one metal light this 
pipe today.

1620
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:32,350
And there was a lady next to her was 
trying to not die laughing,

1621
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:34,060
but she was trying to be polite,
right?

1622
01:14:34,061 --> 01:14:35,050
But she was like,
look,

1623
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:40,500
it's a windy day just to be okay for the
whole Lakota lady.

1624
01:14:44,401 --> 01:14:47,830
The spirits of the love that is 
precisely because it's real.

1625
01:14:47,831 --> 01:14:52,831
You can call when sometimes the spirits 
are trying to tell you just to relax a 

1626
01:14:54,311 --> 01:14:56,340
little bit lighter up.
Yeah.

1627
01:14:56,350 --> 01:15:00,880
It's like someone saying to you in the 
master chief in most people who say,

1628
01:15:00,881 --> 01:15:04,930
no master are assholes.
I don't mean that.

1629
01:15:04,931 --> 01:15:07,480
They're mean people around me.
They're assholes like me,

1630
01:15:07,481 --> 01:15:09,870
but you just shut the fuck up bitch.

1631
01:15:10,050 --> 01:15:11,140
You know,
come on man.

1632
01:15:11,141 --> 01:15:16,141
You don't really mean that.
You're just trying to be like super 

1633
01:15:16,141 --> 01:15:16,150
spiritual.
But I swear to God,

1634
01:15:16,151 --> 01:15:21,151
like there's Yoga teachers that can say 
it after a yoga class and you'll say it 

1635
01:15:21,151 --> 01:15:24,811
back and you mean it because you just 
did 90 minutes of hell together and 

1636
01:15:25,421 --> 01:15:26,950
you'll,
you'll say it and mean it.

1637
01:15:27,790 --> 01:15:30,700
But that's a tricky thing that sometime 
that the guy was there,

1638
01:15:30,701 --> 01:15:35,701
yellow deal and the guy was the thought 
Elforni can sound exactly the same 

1639
01:15:35,701 --> 01:15:36,700
except that one is three.
I don't want like,

1640
01:15:36,730 --> 01:15:39,460
to me like a lot of these six about 
spirituality,

1641
01:15:39,461 --> 01:15:43,060
they don't make me throw up or because 
they are so cheesy,

1642
01:15:43,061 --> 01:15:46,750
so made apps or fig.
But then there are the moments where you

1643
01:15:46,751 --> 01:15:47,590
go,
oh shit,

1644
01:15:47,650 --> 01:15:52,650
that was it.
Like the other day Mandy's was three p 

1645
01:15:52,650 --> 01:15:53,980
like this guy I'm from Canada,
emailed me and he's like,

1646
01:15:53,981 --> 01:15:54,730
oh,
we had this,

1647
01:15:54,990 --> 01:15:56,980
it was a Lakota thing,
right?

1648
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,690
American Indian stuff.
And he was like,

1649
01:15:58,691 --> 01:16:00,870
we had a ceremony and uh,
was um,

1650
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,250
we parade also for your daughter and 
blah blah blah.

1651
01:16:03,251 --> 01:16:03,820
And I'm like,
okay,

1652
01:16:03,821 --> 01:16:04,460
thanks.
That's sweet.

1653
01:16:05,050 --> 01:16:05,830
And the guy goes,
oh,

1654
01:16:05,831 --> 01:16:10,831
by the way,
I kind of have the feeling that she may 

1655
01:16:10,831 --> 01:16:13,050
be sensitive to things like the task or 
if by any chance she had a dream of 

1656
01:16:13,050 --> 01:16:13,960
having to do with American Indians.
And I'm like,

1657
01:16:14,530 --> 01:16:19,530
that's fucking weird because she doesn't
remember the dreams nine nights out of 

1658
01:16:19,530 --> 01:16:19,530
10.
And you know,

1659
01:16:19,530 --> 01:16:20,560
Indian,
she never mentioned that one,

1660
01:16:20,561 --> 01:16:25,561
so there's no right.
But I figured out it doesn't matter to 

1661
01:16:25,561 --> 01:16:26,020
us so I try not to ask a leading 
question.

1662
01:16:26,021 --> 01:16:27,010
So I just asked her,
hey,

1663
01:16:27,011 --> 01:16:30,100
did you have any dream last night?
And she goes,

1664
01:16:30,101 --> 01:16:30,970
no,
and I was like,

1665
01:16:31,090 --> 01:16:32,530
you have say bullshit,
whatever.

1666
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:33,190
And then she goes,
no,

1667
01:16:33,191 --> 01:16:33,610
no,
wait,

1668
01:16:33,611 --> 01:16:33,910
wait,
wait.

1669
01:16:34,270 --> 01:16:39,270
I had a dream,
like my grandpa was taking me to this 

1670
01:16:39,270 --> 01:16:40,690
place where they were Indians and they 
taught me to speak Lakota and yeah,

1671
01:16:40,691 --> 01:16:42,170
we had a good time.
And I went like,

1672
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:47,230
and I don't run with it,
you know,

1673
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:47,830
I don't say,
oh,

1674
01:16:47,831 --> 01:16:50,350
it's because of this period,
this I have no fucking idea.

1675
01:16:50,351 --> 01:16:52,780
Right.
I'm just reporting what happens.

1676
01:16:52,810 --> 01:16:54,250
But when you look at it,
you go like,

1677
01:16:54,940 --> 01:16:59,940
Oh shit.
Maybe the universities a lot weirder 

1678
01:16:59,940 --> 01:17:02,791
than we assume sometimes the problem 
with something like that as you can't 

1679
01:17:02,791 --> 01:17:02,860
measure it,
of course you can't.

1680
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:08,220
There's no way.
Whenever anybody has a clairvoyant 

1681
01:17:08,220 --> 01:17:10,160
moment or a moment where they kind of 
have

1682
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:14,900
an instinct that doesn't seem to make 
any sense but turns out to be true.

1683
01:17:14,901 --> 01:17:15,410
And they go,
well,

1684
01:17:15,411 --> 01:17:17,420
what was that?
Was it coincidental?

1685
01:17:17,421 --> 01:17:18,800
Like what was that?
And you know,

1686
01:17:18,801 --> 01:17:23,801
there's like some Sam Harris type people
that are like very straightforward,

1687
01:17:24,170 --> 01:17:26,690
rational thinking.
They'll,

1688
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:31,700
they'll,
they'll sort of boil it down to 

1689
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:34,360
coincidence and I'm not entirely 
convinced I like Sam and I don't mean to

1690
01:17:34,551 --> 01:17:37,060
talk shit about it because I like him 
and I did stuff,

1691
01:17:37,070 --> 01:17:42,070
but I think that's complete bullshit to 
me or a fundamentalist as much as the 

1692
01:17:42,070 --> 01:17:45,930
religious fundamentalists like the going
so badly to explain every single tool 

1693
01:17:46,130 --> 01:17:50,790
whether you're explaining the as in it's
because God the dds or because no,

1694
01:17:50,830 --> 01:17:53,340
it's because he must be a coincidence 
because the probability of these,

1695
01:17:53,350 --> 01:17:56,990
that it's like that can you just doesn't
meet the life is weird and we don't have

1696
01:17:56,991 --> 01:17:59,180
all the explanations and leave it at 
that time.

1697
01:17:59,270 --> 01:18:01,790
He's right most of the time.
No.

1698
01:18:01,791 --> 01:18:04,790
See,
I think there's a lot of people that try

1699
01:18:04,791 --> 01:18:09,791
to make things sound spiritual and 
connect circumstances and say,

1700
01:18:09,951 --> 01:18:11,150
you know,
it's fate and it's,

1701
01:18:11,590 --> 01:18:16,590
you know,
it's a psychic moment when really it's 

1702
01:18:16,590 --> 01:18:16,850
just total coincidence.
There is a lot of that.

1703
01:18:17,420 --> 01:18:20,660
A lot though is not everything,
it's not everything,

1704
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:25,930
but it's hard to differentiate like what
is like you wouldn't you talk to a guy 

1705
01:18:25,930 --> 01:18:30,401
and he says that your daughter had some 
sort of a dream about native Americans 

1706
01:18:30,401 --> 01:18:34,151
financially.
She's sensitive and then you asked her 

1707
01:18:34,151 --> 01:18:34,151
and she said,
Oh yeah,

1708
01:18:34,151 --> 01:18:35,270
I had a dream about native Americans.
Like the fuck.

1709
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:37,100
What are the odds?
Most kids you.

1710
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:38,210
Yeah,
I had a dream.

1711
01:18:38,211 --> 01:18:43,211
I was on the my little pony store.
I had all the money in the world that 

1712
01:18:43,350 --> 01:18:45,690
night.
Like literally what the fuck are y'all?

1713
01:18:45,710 --> 01:18:46,520
It's right.
And he's like,

1714
01:18:46,550 --> 01:18:48,350
what are the odds of the Sheila remember
anything?

1715
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:53,420
What are the odds that you'd have to do 
with the topic that she never mentioned 

1716
01:18:53,420 --> 01:18:53,570
once in our life?
Science,

1717
01:18:53,620 --> 01:18:56,240
you ever have a dream about someone,
then you get an email from them the next

1718
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:57,830
day and you haven't talked to them in 
years ago too.

1719
01:18:57,890 --> 01:19:02,890
I don't.
I don't necessarily believe that the 

1720
01:19:02,890 --> 01:19:03,260
only connections that people have to 
each other a physical,

1721
01:19:03,261 --> 01:19:04,940
like you have to be there and see each 
other.

1722
01:19:04,941 --> 01:19:07,990
They're there very well.
Might be some sort of a,

1723
01:19:07,991 --> 01:19:12,991
a dream state connection or a thought 
connection that we just can't.

1724
01:19:13,490 --> 01:19:16,640
We can't put on a scale that we can't 
like take a ruler and go,

1725
01:19:16,641 --> 01:19:18,590
oh,
this is a seven inches long.

1726
01:19:18,870 --> 01:19:20,390
You can't,
we can't measure it.

1727
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:23,030
I said I've had enough of those 
experiences.

1728
01:19:23,031 --> 01:19:24,770
And again,
not to believe because I don't know what

1729
01:19:24,771 --> 01:19:25,160
I believe.

1730
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:26,360
Right.
I have no fucking idea.

1731
01:19:26,361 --> 01:19:30,050
I don't know how the universe works,
but do we have enough experiences that.

1732
01:19:30,051 --> 01:19:35,051
Let me think.
There's no way to dcs that Queens 

1733
01:19:35,051 --> 01:19:35,060
student's thesis at Queens.
It didn't do.

1734
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:40,360
And Stephanie single time that he just 
leaves me with kind of my mind is open 

1735
01:19:40,641 --> 01:19:42,350
to possibilities.
I don't know what's out there.

1736
01:19:42,351 --> 01:19:45,200
There's stuff that I experienced there.
Stuff that I don't experience.

1737
01:19:45,260 --> 01:19:50,260
I have zero beliefs about the nature of 
reality because my tools are very 

1738
01:19:50,260 --> 01:19:53,831
limited about what I understand.
But that had been enough of those cases 

1739
01:19:53,831 --> 01:19:53,831
where you go,
oh shit,

1740
01:19:53,831 --> 01:19:56,300
that was a coincidence.
I was maybe 18 or something.

1741
01:19:56,301 --> 01:19:56,990
They had,
um,

1742
01:19:57,240 --> 01:20:00,080
went to hiking with my friends,
go off into my own thing,

1743
01:20:01,010 --> 01:20:04,580
and we go back,
which was great because I was alone with

1744
01:20:04,581 --> 01:20:07,920
this two hot women.
The other guy was with going off.

1745
01:20:07,921 --> 01:20:08,040
I'm

1746
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:08,920
like,
fuck you,

1747
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:13,040
plea of disappear somewhere and enjoy a 
day.

1748
01:20:13,070 --> 01:20:15,480
Should have this too hot.
We went for the rest of the day.

1749
01:20:15,481 --> 01:20:19,830
This is as good as it gets.
And like at one point I literally,

1750
01:20:19,831 --> 01:20:22,530
it's like somebody,
like a phone rang where I got up and I'm

1751
01:20:22,531 --> 01:20:23,250
like,
fuck,

1752
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:26,190
there's up at all these duties have been
a problem right now.

1753
01:20:26,250 --> 01:20:29,760
And there's really no reason to think.
He said he'd be back four hours later,

1754
01:20:29,770 --> 01:20:34,770
an hour had gone by.
There's no reason whatsoever to feel 

1755
01:20:34,770 --> 01:20:34,770
that way.
And that's what I tell myself.

1756
01:20:34,770 --> 01:20:35,460
He's like,
that's bullshit.

1757
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:40,580
Why are you making what kind of a 
bullshit excuse not to deal with the 

1758
01:20:40,580 --> 01:20:40,580
women?
That's beautiful.

1759
01:20:40,580 --> 01:20:41,120
You know,
stay.

1760
01:20:41,130 --> 01:20:41,790
Yeah.
What are you?

1761
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,830
And I try,
I try.

1762
01:20:43,831 --> 01:20:45,480
I keep getting in my head that I was 
like,

1763
01:20:45,481 --> 01:20:47,970
no,
there's a fucking big problem in.

1764
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:50,730
You may not be a bad idea to pay 
attention to it,

1765
01:20:50,731 --> 01:20:53,210
and I'm like,
Jesus Christ here ruin my day.

1766
01:20:53,210 --> 01:20:54,870
Even when you're not here.
Fuck you.

1767
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:57,210
I don't like it.
But I'm like,

1768
01:20:57,211 --> 01:20:58,080
okay,
this is bugging me.

1769
01:20:58,081 --> 01:20:59,340
I'm fine.
I'll walk up.

1770
01:20:59,341 --> 01:21:01,710
I'll start going up the mountain and see
what the hell.

1771
01:21:01,711 --> 01:21:05,040
Like none of this makes sense.
Going up the mountain,

1772
01:21:05,041 --> 01:21:08,850
there's 15 different paths that you can 
take to go up to the mountain.

1773
01:21:08,851 --> 01:21:13,851
I don't know which one I can take a stab
and just pick one because I don't know 

1774
01:21:13,851 --> 01:21:17,721
what else to do and I keep going and I'm
a year these voice called limit.

1775
01:21:18,780 --> 01:21:23,700
So I called back and eventually a year 
did my friend's voice calling again.

1776
01:21:23,730 --> 01:21:25,750
I find him,
the dude got dehydrated.

1777
01:21:25,751 --> 01:21:28,650
I'd gone up too fast too.
And it was done right.

1778
01:21:28,651 --> 01:21:30,570
He had no energy left.
He was on the floor.

1779
01:21:30,571 --> 01:21:33,020
Just collapse them.
Pussies.

1780
01:21:33,021 --> 01:21:37,210
You're hanging around with what?
Him and a peak hour?

1781
01:21:37,810 --> 01:21:38,300
No,
no,

1782
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:38,860
no,
it was.

1783
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:40,760
He said he was going to be back at a 
tie,

1784
01:21:40,761 --> 01:21:43,160
but he had been there longer,
but I don't know.

1785
01:21:43,210 --> 01:21:44,460
He said it because I don't like him 
anymore,

1786
01:21:44,461 --> 01:21:47,550
so I'm all good with that.
I liked your trx like,

1787
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:49,950
fuck you.
I have a little problem with that,

1788
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:54,980
but that's the universe universe.
One of them to dietary should've left 

1789
01:21:54,980 --> 01:21:57,530
bang those church.
That's like one of my deepest regrets.

1790
01:21:57,550 --> 01:22:01,470
A skull and use it as a candle holder.
Exactly like that.

1791
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:04,920
But you know it doesn't love it.
You're like,

1792
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:07,390
why did I have that thought?
Why?

1793
01:22:07,391 --> 01:22:09,070
You have to carry them down.
Yeah.

1794
01:22:09,210 --> 01:22:10,280
I carried him down.
Yeah,

1795
01:22:10,290 --> 01:22:15,290
it was a painting done.
Now I just better get up to starting 

1796
01:22:15,290 --> 01:22:15,290
now.
Pissed off.

1797
01:22:15,290 --> 01:22:17,400
No Wiemann.
Save this asshole.

1798
01:22:17,401 --> 01:22:19,800
Or would the girls do this whole back 
there eating each other out?

1799
01:22:20,010 --> 01:22:20,820
Yeah,
they were right.

1800
01:22:20,821 --> 01:22:21,780
When they're done coming.

1801
01:22:22,550 --> 01:22:24,360
They had this attitude which was like,
really?

1802
01:22:24,420 --> 01:22:25,500
You want to go?
Okay,

1803
01:22:25,501 --> 01:22:30,501
your loss at my doing this.
Will you at least a hero when they found

1804
01:22:31,381 --> 01:22:34,830
out that the guy was sure a great.
I was a hero.

1805
01:22:34,890 --> 01:22:38,850
Who Cares for the people listening is 
making the hand job gesture.

1806
01:22:39,310 --> 01:22:43,680
That's just not up at all the.
Yeah.

1807
01:22:43,681 --> 01:22:48,681
I wonder what that is.
Maybe you just didn't have any faith in 

1808
01:22:48,681 --> 01:22:48,681
your friend.
You knew he was kind of an idiot.

1809
01:22:48,681 --> 01:22:48,681
He,
uh,

1810
01:22:48,681 --> 01:22:48,690
I don't know,
man.

1811
01:22:49,050 --> 01:22:49,740
I don't know.
It could be.

1812
01:22:50,090 --> 01:22:53,010
I'm not saying that like the dream thing
from last night,

1813
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:54,600
that was even weirder.
Ds One.

1814
01:22:54,630 --> 01:22:56,490
I can see how it could be something goes
right.

1815
01:22:56,510 --> 01:22:57,870
Or if I was Sam Harris,
I'd say,

1816
01:22:57,900 --> 01:23:01,740
well,
let's just think for a moment.

1817
01:23:01,930 --> 01:23:03,010
The possibilities,
right?

1818
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:04,530
Yeah.
I don't,

1819
01:23:05,190 --> 01:23:06,070
I just,
I don't

1820
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:11,070
think that he's necessarily completely 
averse to the idea of there being some 

1821
01:23:11,070 --> 01:23:13,360
sort of connection.
I think he and like you and I agree,

1822
01:23:13,390 --> 01:23:18,390
most of that stuff is like the lady that
says the spirits don't want me to let 

1823
01:23:18,390 --> 01:23:18,460
the cycle.
Yeah.

1824
01:23:18,490 --> 01:23:20,590
Most of it's bullshit.
I agree completely,

1825
01:23:20,860 --> 01:23:22,150
man.
I'll tell you one thing.

1826
01:23:22,350 --> 01:23:27,350
It changed my perception on,
on just the supernatural and the 

1827
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:32,460
spiritual is looking into it.
When I did that Saifai show and when I 

1828
01:23:32,460 --> 01:23:33,410
did a,
I did a show called Joe Rogan questions,

1829
01:23:33,450 --> 01:23:38,450
not Joe Rogan questions.
Everything I'm a game show in my head 

1830
01:23:38,450 --> 01:23:41,950
and the game showing my head show was a 
hidden camera show or the people had 

1831
01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:45,400
like an earpiece in and we would tell 
them to go do things and we set this one

1832
01:23:45,401 --> 01:23:50,401
up in Hollywood and you know,
they would have a game show like here's 

1833
01:23:50,401 --> 01:23:50,401
your task.

1834
01:23:50,401 --> 01:23:52,120
This is what you have to do.
And one of the things they had to do was

1835
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:56,890
we told them that your reporter for a 
local television station,

1836
01:23:57,460 --> 01:24:01,510
you're doing the news and you're 
reporting on a Ufo sighting.

1837
01:24:01,810 --> 01:24:05,470
You have to find someone and tell them,
listen,

1838
01:24:05,471 --> 01:24:07,960
I had a witness.
They were here for this Ufo story.

1839
01:24:07,961 --> 01:24:09,970
We have the cameras here,
but they took off.

1840
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Well,
are you willing to say that you saw the 

1841
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:15,400
Ufo to wow and fucking everyone said 
yes.

1842
01:24:16,110 --> 01:24:18,250
They just went right?
Not only did they say yes,

1843
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:23,170
they went right into these elaborate 
fake stories on camera and I went,

1844
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:28,200
wow.
It was such an eyeopener for me and I 

1845
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:30,820
was like,
how many of those people that you see in

1846
01:24:30,821 --> 01:24:35,821
those Ufo documentaries?
Like the famous one was the phoenix 

1847
01:24:35,821 --> 01:24:35,821
lights,
use the phoenix.

1848
01:24:36,460 --> 01:24:38,260
The Phoenix lights was a,
uh,

1849
01:24:38,350 --> 01:24:40,900
a series of sightings that happened in 
Phoenix,

1850
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:43,270
I want to say in the early nineties 
maybe.

1851
01:24:43,690 --> 01:24:48,690
And uh,
it was very controversial because the 

1852
01:24:48,690 --> 01:24:48,690
governor,
uh,

1853
01:24:48,690 --> 01:24:53,660
was,
was saying he was going to get to the 

1854
01:24:53,660 --> 01:24:53,660
bottom of this,
this is all like,

1855
01:24:53,660 --> 01:24:57,770
this is a very controversial.
And then he held a press conference and 

1856
01:24:57,770 --> 01:24:58,630
made a mockery out of it by having 
someone,

1857
01:24:58,950 --> 01:25:02,740
a dress up like an alien and say we 
found the culprit and here he is.

1858
01:25:02,741 --> 01:25:04,930
The guy comes out,
he's got an alien costume on.

1859
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:08,080
And the UFL believers were really pissed
off because they were like,

1860
01:25:08,081 --> 01:25:09,580
fuck you.
I saw something.

1861
01:25:09,581 --> 01:25:13,480
There was a triangle shaped object the 
size of a football field.

1862
01:25:13,481 --> 01:25:15,460
It was flying overhead.
It wasn't making any noise.

1863
01:25:15,910 --> 01:25:20,910
Like all these people had these,
all these things that they said that 

1864
01:25:20,910 --> 01:25:23,731
they saw,
but there's almost no evidence is only 

1865
01:25:23,731 --> 01:25:27,001
evidence of these lights that are 
floating in the sky that they think 

1866
01:25:27,001 --> 01:25:29,350
where there's the governor,
Arizona Governor and the fucking alien.

1867
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:34,560
So hilarious.
But what people were saying that they 

1868
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:35,920
saw there was,
there was one,

1869
01:25:36,220 --> 01:25:39,880
there was one explanation that made 
sense and that was they were flares,

1870
01:25:39,881 --> 01:25:44,881
that the government had a let loose with
parachutes and they were drifting down 

1871
01:25:44,881 --> 01:25:49,621
from the sky slowly and they fell behind
the mountain ranges and that's why they 

1872
01:25:49,621 --> 01:25:53,221
disappeared.
Like if you look at the actual video 

1873
01:25:53,221 --> 01:25:55,891
that,
that people did get there just lights 

1874
01:25:55,891 --> 01:25:55,891
that are hovering in the sky.
It doesn't.

1875
01:25:55,891 --> 01:25:59,440
There's no triangle shaped black objects
that are flying around.

1876
01:25:59,441 --> 01:26:02,920
But everybody had all these.
It's soon as soon as you start saying,

1877
01:26:02,930 --> 01:26:07,930
hey,
there's a phoenix lights and people saw 

1878
01:26:07,930 --> 01:26:07,930
you have for me too,
man.

1879
01:26:07,930 --> 01:26:09,080
I saw it.
I was on my porch was strange that night

1880
01:26:09,081 --> 01:26:14,081
was electric.
I felt it in the air and I agree with 

1881
01:26:14,081 --> 01:26:16,880
you if they'd like.
To me 99 percent of the stories are such

1882
01:26:16,881 --> 01:26:18,700
bullshit,
but to ease.

1883
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:20,660
Like sometime there are some that you 
can't explain,

1884
01:26:20,661 --> 01:26:23,590
which doesn't mean it's real.
It doesn't mean we know why your.

1885
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:26,540
Yes it was a euphoria was anything goes 
or he was that.

1886
01:26:26,541 --> 01:26:31,541
Yeah,
there was something that came into 

1887
01:26:31,541 --> 01:26:31,541
somebodies dream.
Who knows,

1888
01:26:31,541 --> 01:26:31,541
right.
I have no idea,

1889
01:26:31,541 --> 01:26:33,200
but why the hell are we trying to 
explain it that way?

1890
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:34,550
Every single time,
you know,

1891
01:26:34,660 --> 01:26:36,520
sometime just saved.
There is no explanation why.

1892
01:26:36,521 --> 01:26:39,380
Who knows why that's a hey,
that's weird to leave it at that.

1893
01:26:39,700 --> 01:26:42,380
You don't have to run with it,
but you don't have to deny it either.

1894
01:26:42,430 --> 01:26:44,180
You know,
you know what's amazing man?

1895
01:26:44,540 --> 01:26:47,210
Go shows.
What's that good?

1896
01:26:47,211 --> 01:26:49,130
Those ghost shows.
Ghost hunter shows.

1897
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:54,160
Oh yeah,
there was fucking years and all those 

1898
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:55,460
episodes and those motherfuckers got 
nothing.

1899
01:26:55,760 --> 01:27:00,760
It's faithful.
Let's see what comes after the 

1900
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:00,760
commercial break.
I.

1901
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:02,390
That was the bass player tape recorder.

1902
01:27:02,390 --> 01:27:03,200
Listened.
Listened to.

1903
01:27:03,230 --> 01:27:07,190
Very clear.
Did you hear that clearly?

1904
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:10,050
Clearly what he was saying.
Yeah,

1905
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:11,090
those are the best.
Yeah.

1906
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:16,100
Well know what the fuck that is.
There's so much shenanigans and fuckery 

1907
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:16,250
going on.
No shows.

1908
01:27:16,370 --> 01:27:18,530
Wasn't there like a fucking murder 
recently?

1909
01:27:18,770 --> 01:27:19,570
Like a,
a,

1910
01:27:19,571 --> 01:27:24,571
a ghost hunter,
like killed his wife and killed himself 

1911
01:27:24,571 --> 01:27:24,650
or something like that.
Yeah,

1912
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:26,240
something like that.
Like a famous one,

1913
01:27:26,241 --> 01:27:27,740
right?
On television or something like that.

1914
01:27:28,430 --> 01:27:29,960
Yeah.
What Dow Jamie and find it,

1915
01:27:30,290 --> 01:27:32,780
but yeah,
that and um,

1916
01:27:32,810 --> 01:27:35,710
those mediums like the long island 
psychic,

1917
01:27:35,790 --> 01:27:39,170
the fuck Outta here.
And I think finding a problem that,

1918
01:27:39,180 --> 01:27:43,430
that word is so many charlatans that is 
not even fun.

1919
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:46,250
Couple appear featured on ghost 
adventures,

1920
01:27:46,310 --> 01:27:48,110
dead and apparent murder.
Suicide.

1921
01:27:48,230 --> 01:27:53,230
Damn.
Who self styled paranormal 

1922
01:27:53,230 --> 01:27:53,720
investigators.
Yeah.

1923
01:27:53,721 --> 01:27:57,890
They don't give a fucking degree for 
that paranormal investigation.

1924
01:27:57,891 --> 01:28:02,891
Mark and Debbie Constantinos says m and 
a third still unidentified man were 

1925
01:28:04,821 --> 01:28:07,850
killed yesterday in sparks,
Nevada.

1926
01:28:07,910 --> 01:28:11,210
That's where it goes down on a domestic 
violence incident.

1927
01:28:11,211 --> 01:28:14,420
Turned deadly.
That constantino's killed themselves.

1928
01:28:16,190 --> 01:28:21,190
What?
Build themselves as electronic script 

1929
01:28:21,190 --> 01:28:24,331
make that larger looked elect as 
electronic voice phenomenon experts and 

1930
01:28:25,221 --> 01:28:28,400
made frequent appearances on reality 
shows about the supernatural,

1931
01:28:28,401 --> 01:28:31,790
most notably occurring on travel 
channel's ghost adventures.

1932
01:28:33,060 --> 01:28:34,430
Oh,
the couple were a strange.

1933
01:28:34,460 --> 01:28:35,060
Oh,
okay.

1934
01:28:35,270 --> 01:28:40,270
She found him with a new dude or she or 
he found her rather with the new dude.

1935
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:42,500
He killed them both and killed 
themselves.

1936
01:28:43,730 --> 01:28:46,400
Debbie Constantinos had been living with
two roommates,

1937
01:28:46,970 --> 01:28:48,080
approximately 8:00
AM.

1938
01:28:48,081 --> 01:28:53,081
Tuesday.
The police were called department after 

1939
01:28:53,081 --> 01:28:53,081
one of her roommates found their male 
roommate dead.

1940
01:28:53,081 --> 01:28:53,510
And Debbie missing.
Yup,

1941
01:28:53,680 --> 01:28:58,680
that's it.
Police eventually discovered that she 

1942
01:28:58,680 --> 01:29:01,361
was being held hostage by Mark 
Constantino and apartment belonged to 

1943
01:29:01,361 --> 01:29:04,571
one of the couples.
Adult children attempts to negotiate 

1944
01:29:04,571 --> 01:29:04,770
failed around 1:30
PM.

1945
01:29:04,771 --> 01:29:09,771
A Swat team breached the apartment door 
and found both people did Jesus Christ 

1946
01:29:09,940 --> 01:29:10,320
heavy.

1947
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,060
Oh,
can I can't compute.

1948
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:14,070
Why can't people just break up?
Yeah,

1949
01:29:14,110 --> 01:29:14,790
see it.
He's like,

1950
01:29:15,210 --> 01:29:17,760
what the fuck?
Like murder suicide.

1951
01:29:17,761 --> 01:29:22,200
When people break up like God damn you 
pussy you fucking pussy.

1952
01:29:22,210 --> 01:29:24,690
You can't handle her.
Finding a new person.

1953
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:27,210
God.
People are so weak in that regard.

1954
01:29:27,211 --> 01:29:32,190
That is one of the weaker aspects of 
humanity is the inability to accept that

1955
01:29:32,191 --> 01:29:33,660
someone doesn't want to fuck you 
anymore.

1956
01:29:35,130 --> 01:29:37,410
She knew Dick let her go.
She's still,

1957
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:40,500
she's still got some life left dinner,
but the thing you are 17,

1958
01:29:40,501 --> 01:29:41,850
you should be over that.
He's like,

1959
01:29:41,851 --> 01:29:45,360
you deal with it the first time.
So brutal.

1960
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:48,540
I don't even dig.
Like when people flip out about access,

1961
01:29:48,541 --> 01:29:51,510
you know he's almost a stereotype.
I everybody thought about their ex.

1962
01:29:51,610 --> 01:29:54,870
No motherfucker.
You borrowed them into your life.

1963
01:29:55,380 --> 01:29:57,780
You are the one who like if you didn't 
see it,

1964
01:29:57,960 --> 01:29:59,580
worry about what's going on with you.

1965
01:29:59,580 --> 01:30:04,580
If they were really that bad,
if they were such horrible human beings 

1966
01:30:04,580 --> 01:30:07,641
and yard,
a wine opener with that mean or maybe 

1967
01:30:07,641 --> 01:30:10,101
they are not a fucking bad and you're 
just blowing it out over a bar from 

1968
01:30:10,101 --> 01:30:12,630
[inaudible] they are meeting and you can
deal with the fact that they are with 

1969
01:30:12,630 --> 01:30:12,630
somebody else.
He's like,

1970
01:30:12,630 --> 01:30:12,630
there's,
there's definitely that.

1971
01:30:12,630 --> 01:30:17,091
Well,
there's definitely some people that got 

1972
01:30:17,091 --> 01:30:18,411
fucked over like divorces were dudes 
have to pay hundreds of thousands of 

1973
01:30:18,411 --> 01:30:23,120
dollars for the rest of their life,
but even that to me is interesting 

1974
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:23,120
because it's like,
no,

1975
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:24,410
it's not easy,
but it's,

1976
01:30:24,450 --> 01:30:29,450
it's the same woman that you built in 
your life and you need to fucking see 

1977
01:30:29,450 --> 01:30:30,780
that she was capable of that.
You know what I mean?

1978
01:30:30,781 --> 01:30:35,781
So yes,
why she's the scum of the earth and you 

1979
01:30:35,781 --> 01:30:37,971
can and should be a piece with her.
I would also reserve a little bit for 

1980
01:30:37,971 --> 01:30:41,841
your own judgment of how you open the 
door to this lady and the problem is 

1981
01:30:41,841 --> 01:30:41,910
that there's a legal option.

1982
01:30:41,940 --> 01:30:44,940
It's not that she's a scum of the earth.
The problem is you are breaking up.

1983
01:30:44,941 --> 01:30:47,550
She does feel pain.
When I'm not saying,

1984
01:30:47,580 --> 01:30:52,580
I'm not saying that you shouldn't feel 
pain when someone wants to fuck someone 

1985
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:52,580
else because you're going to.
It's just,

1986
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:53,520
it's going to happen.
You're going to feel terrible.

1987
01:30:53,521 --> 01:30:55,770
You're going to feel jealousy,
you're going to feel sadness,

1988
01:30:55,771 --> 01:30:57,180
you're going to feel lost.
It's going to happen,

1989
01:30:57,420 --> 01:31:00,480
but what I'm saying is you have to have 
some fucking perspective.

1990
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:03,570
All right?
You are a human being and if you're here

1991
01:31:03,571 --> 01:31:06,210
in America,
you live in the best place on the planet

1992
01:31:06,211 --> 01:31:11,211
in 2016,
which is the best time ever to be alive 

1993
01:31:11,211 --> 01:31:11,520
and you fucking pussy.
You can't.

1994
01:31:11,570 --> 01:31:13,830
You got match.com.
You Got Tinder,

1995
01:31:14,070 --> 01:31:17,610
get to crack and baby start slinging 
Dick.

1996
01:31:17,870 --> 01:31:20,790
You Know You could sling Dick Today like
you could sling vagina.

1997
01:31:20,791 --> 01:31:21,090
You can.

1998
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:22,560
You can do whatever you want to do 
today.

1999
01:31:22,561 --> 01:31:27,561
This is a different world like move on.
You'll find someone that you don't want 

2000
01:31:27,561 --> 01:31:29,360
to not be with or that you do want to be
with it.

2001
01:31:29,361 --> 01:31:33,000
You can get along with work on yourself,
like figure it out,

2002
01:31:33,001 --> 01:31:34,380
man.
Don't go on a murder.

2003
01:31:34,381 --> 01:31:35,970
Suicide rampage.
I know,

2004
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:39,890
but this woman,
like I have a friend who was.

2005
01:31:39,950 --> 01:31:41,880
I've told,
talked about him before he,

2006
01:31:42,150 --> 01:31:44,970
he was divorced and the divorce was 
brutal.

2007
01:31:44,971 --> 01:31:49,971
It took forever.
She went to all the other lawyers in 

2008
01:31:49,971 --> 01:31:51,360
town so that he couldn't go to them 
because she had context.

2009
01:31:51,361 --> 01:31:53,160
Yeah.
She had contacted them first,

2010
01:31:53,170 --> 01:31:55,440
like it's just a brutal,
brutal shit.

2011
01:31:55,890 --> 01:32:00,890
And she tortured him for like two years,
like changing the terms of the divorce 

2012
01:32:01,110 --> 01:32:06,110
re going back.
All the while he's paying for her 

2013
01:32:06,110 --> 01:32:06,110
lawyer.
Hey,

2014
01:32:06,110 --> 01:32:06,110
she's paying for his lawyer.

2015
01:32:06,110 --> 01:32:07,810
He's paying for everything.
She was trying to bleed them out.

2016
01:32:08,050 --> 01:32:11,680
Then she got this ridiculous settlement 
and she got his house,

2017
01:32:11,710 --> 01:32:16,710
massive beautiful fucking house 
overlooking the ocean like the whole 

2018
01:32:16,710 --> 01:32:16,710
deal.
And on top of that,

2019
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:21,960
because they were married for 12 years,
he has to pay her for the rest of her 

2020
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:21,960
life.
So he's paying.

2021
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:26,730
He's paying her hundreds of thousands of
dollars every year for the rest of her 

2022
01:32:26,730 --> 01:32:27,700
life.
And that's not it.

2023
01:32:28,150 --> 01:32:28,780
I mean,
you could say,

2024
01:32:28,781 --> 01:32:29,410
well,
hey,

2025
01:32:29,411 --> 01:32:31,630
he should have known he let that person 
to his life,

2026
01:32:31,631 --> 01:32:34,060
but he used to love her,
but she,

2027
01:32:34,061 --> 01:32:36,580
in that time of loss and pain and 
suffering,

2028
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:40,240
she had a legal option and the lawyer 
came to her and said,

2029
01:32:40,241 --> 01:32:41,290
listen to your,
your,

2030
01:32:41,291 --> 01:32:42,980
um,
you helped him write you.

2031
01:32:42,981 --> 01:32:45,310
You helped to make me wild.
She didn't do shit.

2032
01:32:45,311 --> 01:32:50,311
She walked around fucking beverly hills 
with a little tiny dog though him and 

2033
01:32:50,311 --> 01:32:53,531
got her nails done and got her fucking 
pedicure done and talked a lot of shit 

2034
01:32:53,531 --> 01:32:53,531
about him while he was at work.

2035
01:32:53,890 --> 01:32:56,530
And that guy busted his ass all day 
long.

2036
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:59,290
But because that was his quote unquote 
wife,

2037
01:32:59,470 --> 01:33:02,500
because they scribbled their name on 
some paper and said,

2038
01:33:02,501 --> 01:33:04,480
I do that guys fucked for the rest of 
his life.

2039
01:33:04,510 --> 01:33:05,170
That I.
I mean,

2040
01:33:05,171 --> 01:33:06,580
I see it a point to,
don't get me wrong.

2041
01:33:06,610 --> 01:33:10,270
There are other cases where the axes,
the evil demon from hell,

2042
01:33:10,271 --> 01:33:13,090
I get that,
but a steel wild.

2043
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:16,510
It's their full that is not yours.
Steel Yard Awano didn't see that.

2044
01:33:16,511 --> 01:33:19,300
They were a demo from highland middle 
domain and too old,

2045
01:33:19,301 --> 01:33:22,550
so he is yet a sock now.
What?

2046
01:33:23,090 --> 01:33:28,090
I think they suck.
She's got nothing going on and this is 

2047
01:33:28,090 --> 01:33:28,090
there.
To her.

2048
01:33:28,090 --> 01:33:32,700
It's like,
what is she gonna do she gonna work all 

2049
01:33:32,700 --> 01:33:32,700
day and take some job?
That sucks.

2050
01:33:32,700 --> 01:33:35,560
She's in her late forties,
early fifties now.

2051
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:37,420
She's an older lady.
She's not.

2052
01:33:37,421 --> 01:33:38,620
She doesn't have the best health.

2053
01:33:38,980 --> 01:33:43,000
Like what is she going to do?
She's just going to keep taking hundreds

2054
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,130
of thousands of dollars every year 
because the law says it's okay.

2055
01:33:45,190 --> 01:33:48,400
Well,
I think that there's a lot of like those

2056
01:33:48,401 --> 01:33:51,040
are pretty dramatic extremes.
There's like,

2057
01:33:51,041 --> 01:33:54,520
I'm never going to take a banyan.
I got to go back to work 10 hours a day.

2058
01:33:54,970 --> 01:33:58,960
Says that or says that they never passed
that my point.

2059
01:33:58,961 --> 01:34:00,700
Right.
But the other one is also Yara.

2060
01:34:00,701 --> 01:34:05,701
NASA is not just each day or is an 
option is you choose an option that's 

2061
01:34:05,701 --> 01:34:06,520
designed to bleed.
The other person that I.

2062
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:07,630
When you know it's not right.
Well,

2063
01:34:07,631 --> 01:34:10,240
he makes good money so it's not like 
he's been getting bullied,

2064
01:34:10,390 --> 01:34:15,390
bled dry,
but he has to pay an exorbitant amount 

2065
01:34:15,390 --> 01:34:19,171
of money every year to a person that he 
doesn't fuck anymore and now he has a 

2066
01:34:19,171 --> 01:34:23,191
wife and he has children.
He has a whole new family and still a 

2067
01:34:23,191 --> 01:34:25,060
giant chunk of his income goes to this 
lady that he doesn't have anything to do

2068
01:34:25,061 --> 01:34:27,310
with anymore and it will to the day she 
dies.

2069
01:34:27,460 --> 01:34:30,160
So she lives to be 500 years old because
of modern science.

2070
01:34:30,850 --> 01:34:33,910
Fucking dude is paying her for the next 
400 years.

2071
01:34:33,911 --> 01:34:34,960
Yeah,
but it's.

2072
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:36,310
Yeah,
that makes you think twice about.

2073
01:34:36,350 --> 01:34:41,350
It's incredible.
It's stupid and I'm married and I'm 

2074
01:34:41,350 --> 01:34:41,350
happy.
I'll tell you right now,

2075
01:34:41,350 --> 01:34:43,450
I'm a happily married person.
I love my wife.

2076
01:34:43,451 --> 01:34:46,030
I love having a family.
It's nice for me.

2077
01:34:46,290 --> 01:34:48,160
It works,
but it's stupid.

2078
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:53,060
Like the contract is dumb.
It's a dumb legal contract and it's.

2079
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:58,080
It's an archaic one and I can understand
a child support.

2080
01:34:58,881 --> 01:35:01,070
I can understand all that stuff.
I understand all that,

2081
01:35:01,460 --> 01:35:06,380
but what drives me crazy is this idea 
that in my friend's case,

2082
01:35:07,220 --> 01:35:10,640
somehow or another,
because he lived with her for 12 years,

2083
01:35:10,670 --> 01:35:15,670
by the way,
it was more than 12 years ago that they 

2084
01:35:15,670 --> 01:35:15,670
separate it,
so let's think of that so it,

2085
01:35:15,670 --> 01:35:17,750
but because he lived with her for 12 
years,

2086
01:35:18,290 --> 01:35:22,940
he has somehow or another fucked her to 
the point where she can't work anymore.

2087
01:35:23,690 --> 01:35:26,120
He gave her so much dick during the time
we're together.

2088
01:35:26,121 --> 01:35:31,121
She just discombobulated.
She can't fill out a form if you have a 

2089
01:35:31,121 --> 01:35:31,340
child.
Okay.

2090
01:35:31,490 --> 01:35:34,610
When the child turns 18,
you're no longer legally responsible.

2091
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:36,170
That's an adult.
They're gone.

2092
01:35:36,260 --> 01:35:38,430
If you have child support,
you don't have to pay it after 18.

2093
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:40,590
When they become 18,
that's your.

2094
01:35:40,710 --> 01:35:45,710
You have to get a job kid.
You have to figure out a way to feed 

2095
01:35:45,710 --> 01:35:45,710
yourself.
It's part of the growth of life,

2096
01:35:45,710 --> 01:35:49,570
not when you're a grown woman and when 
you're a grown woman and she was in her 

2097
01:35:49,570 --> 01:35:52,520
forties when they broke up and for 
whatever fucking reason.

2098
01:35:52,550 --> 01:35:57,550
We have these wacky laws that state that
this person doesn't have to work again 

2099
01:35:57,550 --> 01:35:57,550
forever.
No children by the way.

2100
01:35:57,550 --> 01:35:58,550
No children.
That's cool.

2101
01:35:58,760 --> 01:36:00,200
They never had kids together.
What is it?

2102
01:36:00,270 --> 01:36:05,270
These 12.
The magic number is like if it was 11 

2103
01:36:05,270 --> 01:36:05,270
then.

2104
01:36:05,270 --> 01:36:05,270
Oh fuck it.
You don't have to it like,

2105
01:36:05,270 --> 01:36:05,870
I don't know.
I think,

2106
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:11,200
I think it varies,
but I think in California for whatever 

2107
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:11,200
reason,
it was 12.

2108
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:14,660
You know,
I think 10 is a big one,

2109
01:36:14,690 --> 01:36:19,690
like 10 years is the big one.
So it might've been that it was 10 

2110
01:36:19,690 --> 01:36:21,290
because a Ralphie may just got,
just got jacked.

2111
01:36:21,380 --> 01:36:23,140
Apparently his,
uh,

2112
01:36:23,450 --> 01:36:28,450
his woman just divorced him after 10 and
that same number 10 and at 10 the party 

2113
01:36:30,561 --> 01:36:32,910
begins.
So if you are thinking about it,

2114
01:36:33,210 --> 01:36:38,210
now is the time to call it.
It's hard to imagine someone not being 

2115
01:36:38,210 --> 01:36:40,220
in your life,
but yet you have to pay the money.

2116
01:36:40,221 --> 01:36:41,240
Yeah.
That's fucked up.

2117
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:43,400
And they're just no way around it.
But in his case,

2118
01:36:43,401 --> 01:36:48,401
like his wife has children or his ex 
wife now has children from him and so he

2119
01:36:50,001 --> 01:36:52,370
is definitely financial responsible for 
her children,

2120
01:36:52,580 --> 01:36:53,400
his children,
their,

2121
01:36:53,450 --> 01:36:54,050
their,
you know,

2122
01:36:54,330 --> 01:36:59,330
their children and I think he should pay
alimony because she has to take care of 

2123
01:36:59,330 --> 01:37:02,060
those kids and she can't really work.

2124
01:37:02,210 --> 01:37:02,840
Like,
you know,

2125
01:37:02,870 --> 01:37:04,520
she's not like a free person who's 
single,

2126
01:37:04,700 --> 01:37:06,290
but if you're a free person that's 
single,

2127
01:37:07,010 --> 01:37:09,620
I can understand you needing a couple of
years to get on your feet.

2128
01:37:09,650 --> 01:37:14,650
That's fair.
That's what I mean about the grades is 

2129
01:37:14,650 --> 01:37:14,850
like one is one extreme,
one is you get nothing years.

2130
01:37:15,050 --> 01:37:20,050
Fair enough.
I mean if you say if you live with a 

2131
01:37:20,050 --> 01:37:22,841
woman and for 10 years you're married 
and for 10 years she doesn't have to 

2132
01:37:22,841 --> 01:37:26,561
work because you're some fucking diamond
merchant downtown la or something like 

2133
01:37:26,561 --> 01:37:30,521
that.
And you break up with her and then you 

2134
01:37:30,521 --> 01:37:30,521
know,
you got a house,

2135
01:37:30,521 --> 01:37:30,521
bitch,
you're on your own.

2136
01:37:30,521 --> 01:37:32,540
She doesn't have any skills or anything 
like that's fucked up.

2137
01:37:32,630 --> 01:37:33,600
Capital fierce.
These fierce,

2138
01:37:33,610 --> 01:37:38,610
fair.
Something like that is a reasonable 

2139
01:37:38,610 --> 01:37:40,571
compromise.
But there's this weird thing that they 

2140
01:37:40,571 --> 01:37:42,110
do where it's called the quality of 
life.

2141
01:37:42,110 --> 01:37:44,630
You're supposed to maintain the same 
quality of life.

2142
01:37:44,631 --> 01:37:45,770
Like what?
Yeah,

2143
01:37:45,771 --> 01:37:50,771
that's bullshit.
So if you're living with like coby 

2144
01:37:50,771 --> 01:37:50,771
Bryant,
like coby Brian's wife,

2145
01:37:50,771 --> 01:37:55,190
like she's responsible for his children.
So she should certainly get money and.

2146
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:58,080
But how much money man,
how,

2147
01:37:58,140 --> 01:38:00,780
how does she get hundreds of millions of
dollars.

2148
01:38:00,781 --> 01:38:02,760
Like how does that work?
You know,

2149
01:38:02,820 --> 01:38:04,200
forever.
Forever.

2150
01:38:04,250 --> 01:38:06,030
Yeah.
That's nuts to the end of time.

2151
01:38:06,130 --> 01:38:08,730
Till till the day they die.
And if you don't have a Prenup,

2152
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:10,150
get ugly.
So.

2153
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:11,160
Yup.
And he's like,

2154
01:38:11,161 --> 01:38:12,910
no,
it prenup is not real bad.

2155
01:38:12,990 --> 01:38:14,320
Like fuck you.
This is a construct.

2156
01:38:14,340 --> 01:38:16,290
Anyway,
the whole thing is a colon threat with a

2157
01:38:16,310 --> 01:38:19,470
volts the states.
And if you don't have a Prenup,

2158
01:38:19,471 --> 01:38:21,870
believe me,
those conversations get way more intense

2159
01:38:21,871 --> 01:38:26,871
when things get ugly.
When a woman knows there's no prenup 

2160
01:38:26,871 --> 01:38:26,871
involved.
Yeah.

2161
01:38:26,871 --> 01:38:31,380
Yeah.
Like I have a buddy who doesn't have a 

2162
01:38:31,380 --> 01:38:31,380
prenup and him and his wife are fighting
and I go,

2163
01:38:31,380 --> 01:38:31,380
do you have a prenup?

2164
01:38:31,380 --> 01:38:35,990
You know,
how dare you could say we were having a 

2165
01:38:38,521 --> 01:38:39,440
conversation about.
He's like,

2166
01:38:39,450 --> 01:38:44,450
oh,
I couldn't figure out a way to like 

2167
01:38:44,450 --> 01:38:44,450
justify having a prenup.
I go,

2168
01:38:44,450 --> 01:38:48,351
here's a way.
If you were in love and you're married 

2169
01:38:48,351 --> 01:38:48,660
together and you're going to be together
forever,

2170
01:38:48,661 --> 01:38:51,570
the Prenup doesn't mean shit,
but it doesn't mean anything.

2171
01:38:51,900 --> 01:38:53,850
If you really plan on being together 
forever,

2172
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:59,000
but have that person wants to fucking 
abandoned ship than drain you like a 

2173
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:02,610
fucking plug at the bottom of a bathtub 
will will,

2174
01:39:02,620 --> 01:39:03,330
will,
will blow,

2175
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:06,330
will bump.
That's when you need a prenup.

2176
01:39:06,570 --> 01:39:11,570
Because if you're gonna break up,
that's an a prenup comes into play and 

2177
01:39:11,570 --> 01:39:12,000
then you need it and you should have it 
right,

2178
01:39:12,420 --> 01:39:13,650
but if you're going to be together 
forever,

2179
01:39:13,651 --> 01:39:18,651
the Prenup doesn't mean a goddamn thing 
because you're going to be together 

2180
01:39:18,651 --> 01:39:18,651
forever,
so don't worry about it.

2181
01:39:18,651 --> 01:39:20,250
Get a fucking prenup.
Silly Bitch.

2182
01:39:20,430 --> 01:39:25,430
It only.
It only becomes a factor if you get 

2183
01:39:25,430 --> 01:39:28,191
divorced.
That's why any woman that says he wants 

2184
01:39:28,191 --> 01:39:28,191
to have a peanut,
you don't think it's gonna last?

2185
01:39:28,191 --> 01:39:30,000
No,
I think it is going to last,

2186
01:39:30,570 --> 01:39:34,300
but it's.
It doesn't this fucking.

2187
01:39:34,650 --> 01:39:37,710
The logic of not having a prenup is 
insane.

2188
01:39:38,100 --> 01:39:41,610
If we break up,
I want to get financially fucked.

2189
01:39:41,650 --> 01:39:45,820
That's how much I love you so much.
I want to stay together.

2190
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:51,000
I want to stay together with you under 
the threat of being financially ruined 

2191
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,600
because otherwise it's now through love.
No,

2192
01:39:52,601 --> 01:39:54,960
it's fucking chick said to me.
The date was hilarious.

2193
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:55,770
She goes,
well,

2194
01:39:55,830 --> 01:40:00,830
I'll tell you what.
More and more women today are paying 

2195
01:40:00,830 --> 01:40:00,830
alimony.
I go name one.

2196
01:40:00,830 --> 01:40:03,180
It's like silence.
Roseanne Barr,

2197
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:05,430
that's all they say.
Roseanne Barr.

2198
01:40:07,770 --> 01:40:10,110
Tom Arnold.
Tom Arnold.

2199
01:40:10,410 --> 01:40:12,450
Okay.
We got one under our belt.

2200
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:16,980
That's one victory as opposed to a what?
What?

2201
01:40:17,220 --> 01:40:21,090
Hundreds of millions of guys that have 
been fucked over by the system.

2202
01:40:21,730 --> 01:40:22,590
Yeah.
I don't get.

2203
01:40:22,740 --> 01:40:27,740
I actually don't even get the huddle 
idea of marriage and I don't mean like 

2204
01:40:27,740 --> 01:40:27,740
committed relationship.
I got that.

2205
01:40:27,740 --> 01:40:32,361
I got a little that about why the fuck 
do you need to bring into state and low 

2206
01:40:32,361 --> 01:40:35,761
years because it's a business.
That's what I mean is like if it said a 

2207
01:40:35,761 --> 01:40:36,480
nature of shape,
why do you need to all this shit in?

2208
01:40:36,530 --> 01:40:39,180
Well,
it's a business in terms of like there's

2209
01:40:39,181 --> 01:40:41,610
a business of the diamonds,
you know,

2210
01:40:41,790 --> 01:40:46,170
is three months to add too much to ask 
like those fucking diamond merchants.

2211
01:40:46,171 --> 01:40:48,150
Fuck,
I'm bringing them up again on a wire.

2212
01:40:48,380 --> 01:40:49,530
But,
but diamonds,

2213
01:40:49,531 --> 01:40:52,650
the idea that three months salary,
three months,

2214
01:40:53,050 --> 01:40:54,490
that is a fucking

2215
01:40:54,490 --> 01:40:59,490
crazy for guy has to work three months 
out of a whole year for a little rock 

2216
01:41:00,220 --> 01:41:02,460
that goes around your finger just to 
show you.

2217
01:41:02,461 --> 01:41:07,461
You have too much to ask.
That would be a deal breaker right off 

2218
01:41:08,231 --> 01:41:08,950
the bat.
He's like,

2219
01:41:08,951 --> 01:41:11,150
what you first of all fucking month,
what you want the.

2220
01:41:11,480 --> 01:41:13,630
We're all going to cost thousands of 
dollars.

2221
01:41:13,631 --> 01:41:15,580
Fuck off.
I just have nothing in common with you.

2222
01:41:15,581 --> 01:41:20,581
I'm done.
Most people don't have enough money to 

2223
01:41:20,581 --> 01:41:24,331
get by period like there scraped,
but most people are going pretty much 

2224
01:41:24,331 --> 01:41:25,140
checked the channel.
They have like,

2225
01:41:25,170 --> 01:41:30,170
you know,
a little bit of money in the bank case 

2226
01:41:30,170 --> 01:41:32,191
fucking shit goes terribly wrong,
but they don't have three months worth 

2227
01:41:32,191 --> 01:41:35,161
of money in the bank.
So what are you going to do for three 

2228
01:41:35,161 --> 01:41:37,861
months?
I'm going to suffer so that you could 

2229
01:41:37,861 --> 01:41:37,861
have a rock on your finger.

2230
01:41:37,861 --> 01:41:38,470
What am I gonna do?
I'm gonna eat potato chips for lunch and

2231
01:41:38,471 --> 01:41:42,130
fucking starve to death.
Ramen noodles at dinner every night.

2232
01:41:42,230 --> 01:41:44,840
Whoa.
Save 20 books to go through the jaw.

2233
01:41:45,100 --> 01:41:49,570
So it goes into the diamond jor now.
But that to me is the ultimate bullshit.

2234
01:41:49,571 --> 01:41:52,990
He's like,
do people actually fucking like diamonds

2235
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:54,950
is not a status symbol nights come on.
He's like,

2236
01:41:56,350 --> 01:41:59,800
you fucking fake thing that looks 
exactly the same.

2237
01:41:59,801 --> 01:42:01,900
And you,
unless you were a jeweler with them,

2238
01:42:01,940 --> 01:42:04,860
but it's not the same.
But that's what I mean.

2239
01:42:04,870 --> 01:42:09,870
He's like,
it's about it costs a shitload of money 

2240
01:42:09,870 --> 01:42:09,870
is a symbol is not the yellow thing.
It's like,

2241
01:42:09,870 --> 01:42:10,540
what can you do with three months 
salary?

2242
01:42:10,541 --> 01:42:13,090
You can do so much fucking good stuff.
How about we do that?

2243
01:42:13,091 --> 01:42:15,310
So celebrate the wedding or whatever to 
hell,

2244
01:42:15,370 --> 01:42:15,940
blah,
blah,

2245
01:42:15,941 --> 01:42:16,570
blah,
blah,

2246
01:42:16,571 --> 01:42:17,540
blah.
Give me the rock.

2247
01:42:22,790 --> 01:42:25,460
My aunt got fucked over the.
She uh,

2248
01:42:25,480 --> 01:42:26,950
she married this guy.
He was real shady.

2249
01:42:27,220 --> 01:42:28,780
He was always shady,
like from the beginning.

2250
01:42:29,080 --> 01:42:32,260
And she had a nice wedding ring.
Nice fat rock.

2251
01:42:32,380 --> 01:42:34,180
When they got divorced she went and go,
checked out.

2252
01:42:34,181 --> 01:42:36,570
Cubic Zirconia.
Ah,

2253
01:42:36,610 --> 01:42:38,250
that's the way you have to do it.
Yup.

2254
01:42:38,290 --> 01:42:39,970
She fucked him over.
He,

2255
01:42:40,240 --> 01:42:43,060
he got her a fake rock.
That's the way to do it.

2256
01:42:43,100 --> 01:42:44,530
They look so real,
man.

2257
01:42:44,650 --> 01:42:47,820
It's hard to tell.
I guess a diamond merchant can tell like

2258
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:50,630
that,
but not a fucking dynamometor trends.

2259
01:42:50,700 --> 01:42:52,690
So how about we don't deal with that.
We know.

2260
01:42:52,691 --> 01:42:54,670
It's not like having a fake Ferrari.
Yeah.

2261
01:42:54,730 --> 01:42:59,730
You know,
like a fake Ferrari will drive like 

2262
01:42:59,730 --> 01:42:59,730
shit.
Exactly.

2263
01:42:59,730 --> 01:42:59,810
That there's something good.
Yelled,

2264
01:42:59,830 --> 01:43:02,710
yelled the diamonds and there's nothing 
so crazy.

2265
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:05,280
I know a lady who's a billionaire,
uh,

2266
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:07,660
her and her husband,
her husband's is very,

2267
01:43:07,661 --> 01:43:10,240
very wealthy tycoon type character.

2268
01:43:10,240 --> 01:43:12,880
He's kind of hilarious.
He dresses like sergeant pepper's lonely

2269
01:43:12,881 --> 01:43:17,881
hearts club band and it was like those 
little outfits on throws these magical 

2270
01:43:17,881 --> 01:43:19,900
parties in Malibu or just fucking huge,
huge,

2271
01:43:19,901 --> 01:43:21,760
crazy parties would probably cross like 
a million bucks.

2272
01:43:21,780 --> 01:43:26,080
The guy's an animal,
but he got her to this rock that I don't

2273
01:43:26,081 --> 01:43:28,810
know enough about diamonds to say how 
much it cost,

2274
01:43:29,080 --> 01:43:31,880
but it's well over a million dollars.
Well,

2275
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:33,400
it's huge.
I mean it's fucking.

2276
01:43:33,401 --> 01:43:34,660
It's like a watch.
It's a flavor.

2277
01:43:34,661 --> 01:43:36,220
Flave watch.
Hang it.

2278
01:43:36,221 --> 01:43:39,040
It's like our clock on her finger.
It's so big.

2279
01:43:39,820 --> 01:43:42,760
What is this?
Was this a new guy?

2280
01:43:42,761 --> 01:43:45,040
She's with?
This just came out of this weekend.

2281
01:43:45,070 --> 01:43:47,410
Thirty five carat diamond ring that 
makes.

2282
01:43:47,650 --> 01:43:52,650
Who is this dude?
She's with some billionaire from 

2283
01:43:52,650 --> 01:43:52,650
Australia.
Will look at him.

2284
01:43:52,650 --> 01:43:53,700
Let me see what he looks like.
Yeah,

2285
01:43:53,970 --> 01:43:58,970
that looks like you need a 35 to get 50.
40th five.

2286
01:43:59,560 --> 01:44:00,350
Thirty five it says.
Yeah.

2287
01:44:00,370 --> 01:44:01,600
She's still hot.
Yeah.

2288
01:44:01,910 --> 01:44:04,230
How's that ass look big,
right?

2289
01:44:04,820 --> 01:44:06,950
Big Juicy Papao.
Look at that ring.

2290
01:44:07,370 --> 01:44:10,310
She was like much smaller and thinner 
when she was younger.

2291
01:44:10,311 --> 01:44:14,050
Huh?
Not that I liked that.

2292
01:44:14,260 --> 01:44:16,030
That's 35 carrots.
That's what that is.

2293
01:44:16,580 --> 01:44:17,920
I was expecting bigger.
I don't mean.

2294
01:44:17,921 --> 01:44:19,240
I don't know.
I was too.

2295
01:44:19,420 --> 01:44:22,540
I'm telling you that the lady that I 
know her ring is bigger than that.

2296
01:44:23,990 --> 01:44:25,530
Yeah.
That shit makes me like,

2297
01:44:25,550 --> 01:44:27,820
how much does that cost projectile 
vomiting?

2298
01:44:27,830 --> 01:44:29,930
Just looking at this.
Yeah,

2299
01:44:29,931 --> 01:44:33,050
that's probably,
that's probably a million bucks.

2300
01:44:34,430 --> 01:44:38,570
This is a lot like you remember when j 
Lo and Ben Affleck were a character?

2301
01:44:38,780 --> 01:44:43,780
They were.
There were one we ever a great story.

2302
01:44:46,370 --> 01:44:51,370
Great Story.
I know a dude who's a construction guy 

2303
01:44:51,370 --> 01:44:52,750
and uh,
he uh,

2304
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:55,940
was dealing with them at the time and 
uh,

2305
01:44:56,030 --> 01:44:58,310
allegedly the story is,
uh,

2306
01:44:58,320 --> 01:45:02,900
the J lo.
Ben Affleck had like a full 10,

2307
01:45:02,910 --> 01:45:05,240
a basketball court that he had at his 
place.

2308
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:10,220
She wanted to take the basketball court 
apart and put it in her house.

2309
01:45:10,570 --> 01:45:14,150
I guess it's a surprise to surprise him.
And the guy's like,

2310
01:45:14,151 --> 01:45:15,950
what?
No,

2311
01:45:16,040 --> 01:45:16,820
I'm not doing that.

2312
01:45:18,890 --> 01:45:23,270
Pokes you imagine what kind of fucking 
craziness that bitch has in her head.

2313
01:45:23,720 --> 01:45:28,720
She's like,
I'm just going to move his favorite 

2314
01:45:28,720 --> 01:45:30,461
place to my place.
That way when he has his basketball 

2315
01:45:30,461 --> 01:45:30,461
games,
you'll have to have it at my house.

2316
01:45:30,461 --> 01:45:31,550
Like what?
Like she,

2317
01:45:31,570 --> 01:45:33,590
she wanted to move it,
like take it,

2318
01:45:33,740 --> 01:45:34,780
put it,
I want it.

2319
01:45:35,340 --> 01:45:37,340
It's mine.
He's mine.

2320
01:45:37,700 --> 01:45:42,700
A basketball court in my house.
I like the Bursa nation.

2321
01:45:45,140 --> 01:45:50,140
Oh my God.
People do some crazy shit to get into 

2322
01:45:50,140 --> 01:45:50,140
relationships.
I mean,

2323
01:45:50,140 --> 01:45:54,671
he's like poutine APP with people 
request to Jesse because he's like,

2324
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:58,820
fuck that.
I don't need it that bad.

2325
01:46:00,020 --> 01:46:01,220
I don't know man.
I don't get it.

2326
01:46:01,221 --> 01:46:04,160
It's never call friend and his wife 
answers his cell phone.

2327
01:46:04,410 --> 01:46:04,860
It.
No,

2328
01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:08,630
I'm missing out on that experience.
You've got a lot that happened more than

2329
01:46:08,631 --> 01:46:13,631
once and I'd lose all respect for that 
guy unless he's in the middle of 

2330
01:46:13,631 --> 01:46:13,631
fucking,
uh,

2331
01:46:13,631 --> 01:46:17,980
holding up a pan of hot oil that he's 
carrying the stove or something and it's

2332
01:46:18,471 --> 01:46:20,870
an emergency phone call or something.
I mean,

2333
01:46:20,871 --> 01:46:23,240
why the fuck would your wife answer your
cell phone?

2334
01:46:23,510 --> 01:46:25,820
I think that's an accusatory way.
Hello?

2335
01:46:26,100 --> 01:46:29,690
Who is it?
This is Joe's.

2336
01:46:29,691 --> 01:46:30,860
Dave there.
Joe.

2337
01:46:30,861 --> 01:46:32,450
Who?
Joe Rogan.

2338
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:34,850
Hold on.
Hey Dave.

2339
01:46:34,851 --> 01:46:36,710
Why is your fucking wife answering your 
phone?

2340
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:37,430
Like,
um,

2341
01:46:37,431 --> 01:46:39,830
some chick who was calling or a gay 
lover?

2342
01:46:39,831 --> 01:46:43,370
He fucking Weirdo.
Will you keep your phone in your pocket?

2343
01:46:43,371 --> 01:46:45,460
Bitch?
Don't let her have it.

2344
01:46:45,770 --> 01:46:48,960
Not that I think that's like our 
security daylight.

2345
01:46:48,990 --> 01:46:50,420
There is like Ken Score,

2346
01:46:50,430 --> 01:46:52,710
a hot woman,
so if I cannot underscore one,

2347
01:46:52,711 --> 01:46:55,530
I'm just going to hold onto her.
No Metro batshit crazy.

2348
01:46:55,531 --> 01:46:58,710
She Gans I'm going to put up with 
anything because I'm afraid to be alone.

2349
01:46:59,100 --> 01:47:01,170
That I think is speaking of the book 
stuff.

2350
01:47:01,171 --> 01:47:05,160
That's another thing that I noticed 
changing in me.

2351
01:47:06,970 --> 01:47:10,290
It's for the longest time I had these 
exact dynamics that I'm criticizing.

2352
01:47:10,291 --> 01:47:11,790
I had that made me right.
That was like,

2353
01:47:11,791 --> 01:47:16,791
I don't want to be alone.
If I'm a woman I want to stick to her 

2354
01:47:16,791 --> 01:47:17,310
and she does some crazy shit.
That's totally fine.

2355
01:47:17,311 --> 01:47:19,500
It's like that's fear.
That's insecurity.

2356
01:47:19,560 --> 01:47:24,560
That's if I let her go,
I'll never get laid with the hottest 

2357
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:27,201
woman again kind of thing.
And at one point I think is like I had 

2358
01:47:27,201 --> 01:47:28,770
dealt with an app shade that something's
not me where I was just like,

2359
01:47:28,771 --> 01:47:30,240
you know what?
From now on,

2360
01:47:30,241 --> 01:47:32,610
and I don't even mean that in a bad way.
I don't fuck.

2361
01:47:32,611 --> 01:47:37,611
You want to make one compromise in my 
life if I have to be anything gathered 

2362
01:47:37,611 --> 01:47:40,080
and why am 24 slash seven?
I don't want to be with you.

2363
01:47:40,470 --> 01:47:43,050
You may be a nice person.
I'm not criticizing you,

2364
01:47:43,620 --> 01:47:45,300
but I don't want you in my life.
Right?

2365
01:47:45,370 --> 01:47:50,370
But what if you smoke a joint with her 
and she throws that Posi around like 

2366
01:47:50,370 --> 01:47:51,080
fucking John Elway,
just with the,

2367
01:47:51,130 --> 01:47:55,690
the long yards.
Woo God damn walk.

2368
01:47:55,720 --> 01:47:59,590
Like when elway wax that ball,
that helps for those two hours.

2369
01:47:59,680 --> 01:48:01,980
But then there's the rest of your life.
So those two,

2370
01:48:01,990 --> 01:48:04,440
our sort of good eight.
Now let's move on to something,

2371
01:48:04,660 --> 01:48:07,000
but then when you're at work thinking 
about those two hours,

2372
01:48:07,001 --> 01:48:11,410
you know,
loosen up the God damn it.

2373
01:48:11,860 --> 01:48:15,400
You know what I'm saying?
Now I'm going for a layup.

2374
01:48:18,010 --> 01:48:21,190
Flying from the three point line right 
through the net.

2375
01:48:21,191 --> 01:48:22,820
This bitches hot.
Yup.

2376
01:48:23,130 --> 01:48:28,130
Yup.
Then you now if you break up with that 

2377
01:48:28,130 --> 01:48:30,970
phone is just ringing off the hook from 
dudes trying to get ahold of that Voodoo

2378
01:48:30,970 --> 01:48:31,880
Pussy.
Right?

2379
01:48:32,140 --> 01:48:37,140
What are you going to do now?
You're going to be cool and calm and 

2380
01:48:37,140 --> 01:48:39,391
collected.
You got to try because he fucks up the 

2381
01:48:39,391 --> 01:48:40,300
rest of your life or does even if he was
every single day,

2382
01:48:40,301 --> 01:48:44,080
that is the most magical sex in the ward
for the two hours that you spend.

2383
01:48:44,200 --> 01:48:49,150
There are 22 more hours.
Just sleep a lot that it's all okay.

2384
01:48:49,170 --> 01:48:51,740
Right?
Then you can put up with a thought.

2385
01:48:51,741 --> 01:48:53,570
It's solo artist.
I know this dude who to,

2386
01:48:53,630 --> 01:48:55,770
who was a mobster and talked about going
to jail,

2387
01:48:55,820 --> 01:49:00,820
going to jail was no big deal.
The key was you got to sleep your time 

2388
01:49:00,820 --> 01:49:00,820
away.
We'd sleep like 18 hours a day.

2389
01:49:00,820 --> 01:49:01,990
That works.
And I was like,

2390
01:49:01,991 --> 01:49:03,010
really?
Like,

2391
01:49:03,011 --> 01:49:04,630
yeah,
that's you gotta do just sleep with time

2392
01:49:04,631 --> 01:49:09,631
away.
A lot of people are up to doing pushups 

2393
01:49:09,631 --> 01:49:09,631
now me,
I sleep my time away.

2394
01:49:09,631 --> 01:49:09,631
By the time,
you know,

2395
01:49:09,631 --> 01:49:10,840
two years is gone,
nothing.

2396
01:49:10,841 --> 01:49:12,040
I slept,
I got arrested.

2397
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:15,710
Okay.
Eighteen hours a day.

2398
01:49:15,711 --> 01:49:17,420
Jesus,
he's an asshole.

2399
01:49:18,270 --> 01:49:19,420
What are you going to do?
Yeah.

2400
01:49:20,030 --> 01:49:20,930
But um,
yeah,

2401
01:49:20,931 --> 01:49:23,930
there's some,
some girls are just so hot and then it's

2402
01:49:24,060 --> 01:49:26,480
also like there's something else that's 
going on.

2403
01:49:26,790 --> 01:49:31,790
Love is real and emotions are real and 
appreciating someone is real and there's

2404
01:49:33,891 --> 01:49:38,891
definitely that,
but there's also some biological tricks 

2405
01:49:38,891 --> 01:49:40,040
that go on when you connect with someone
and you have sex with them.

2406
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:45,400
There's like some weird sort of 
possessive tricks where your DNA doesn't

2407
01:49:47,170 --> 01:49:48,130
want them to be with

2408
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:52,450
anyone else because your DNA wants to 
procreate with them and that's where you

2409
01:49:52,451 --> 01:49:57,451
have to protect this.
This one person who you're shooting 

2410
01:49:57,451 --> 01:49:57,940
loads into who you're going to have 
babies with.

2411
01:49:57,941 --> 01:49:58,960
Where'd you go?
What are you talking to?

2412
01:49:58,961 --> 01:50:00,910
That guy I saw the way that guy hugged 
you,

2413
01:50:01,140 --> 01:50:03,730
like all this craziness that comes about
you,

2414
01:50:03,740 --> 01:50:04,320
you,
you,

2415
01:50:04,360 --> 01:50:07,360
that person becomes you.
They become your property,

2416
01:50:07,361 --> 01:50:10,030
but you can't control them.
And then if they're freaky,

2417
01:50:10,031 --> 01:50:12,940
if they're crazy freaky bitches,
you got to go this crazy freaky bitches.

2418
01:50:12,941 --> 01:50:17,941
Probably crazy with other dudes too.
And then she's probably been crazy 

2419
01:50:17,941 --> 01:50:20,970
freaky bitch with other dudes before me.
So now I have to think that those dudes 

2420
01:50:20,970 --> 01:50:25,060
know that she's slinging that fucking 
superstitious stitious pussy out there.

2421
01:50:26,270 --> 01:50:30,600
What I think anybody ever in the history
of mankind use of still arts together.

2422
01:50:30,610 --> 01:50:31,790
That's,
that's first,

2423
01:50:32,410 --> 01:50:34,370
she's got some fucking Voodoo Posey.

2424
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:38,260
She's got some supernatural pussy.
There's people that can do things better

2425
01:50:38,310 --> 01:50:40,200
and includes fucking,
you know,

2426
01:50:40,201 --> 01:50:45,201
like everybody.
I have you dated a girl who was really 

2427
01:50:45,201 --> 01:50:45,201
hot but just terrible.
Terrible in bed.

2428
01:50:45,310 --> 01:50:46,840
No,
I miss out on that experience.

2429
01:50:47,020 --> 01:50:48,850
I went on a couple of them,
but I had one of them.

2430
01:50:48,940 --> 01:50:50,910
I was like,
I gotta stop with your Skus.

2431
01:50:50,911 --> 01:50:52,950
Stopped doing really bad.
Yeah,

2432
01:50:52,951 --> 01:50:57,951
she's just a for all sorts of reasons.
I guess like maybe it wasn't her fault.

2433
01:50:59,081 --> 01:51:03,460
Maybe she was just like insecure or 
uncomfortable or unaware or,

2434
01:51:03,461 --> 01:51:08,461
you know,
it turned out later on that I found the 

2435
01:51:08,461 --> 01:51:08,640
shed like a coke problem that I,
I wasn't aware of that would,

2436
01:51:09,100 --> 01:51:14,100
that I've never done it.
But apparently that just blocks you off 

2437
01:51:14,100 --> 01:51:14,890
from like emotional.
What of it is that,

2438
01:51:14,891 --> 01:51:17,560
what made it bad side?
We just,

2439
01:51:17,561 --> 01:51:18,460
it wasn't good.

2440
01:51:18,970 --> 01:51:23,970
You know,
it's like the girl that I dated before 

2441
01:51:23,970 --> 01:51:23,970
her was a freak,
so I was like,

2442
01:51:23,970 --> 01:51:25,900
oh my God are lowering sucks.
It's not fun.

2443
01:51:25,901 --> 01:51:26,560
Yeah.
Yeah.

2444
01:51:26,860 --> 01:51:28,890
It's like when,
when someone's just,

2445
01:51:28,960 --> 01:51:30,940
when they're all in,
you know,

2446
01:51:30,941 --> 01:51:35,941
and then the next girl is not all in you
like kind flying someone was all in my 

2447
01:51:35,941 --> 01:51:40,120
head a gamble for the next one.
I'm not here to pay play penny slots.

2448
01:51:40,420 --> 01:51:43,150
I'm here to push a fucking mortgage into
the center of the table and go,

2449
01:51:44,230 --> 01:51:46,570
what are we doing there?
That's where the excitement is,

2450
01:51:46,571 --> 01:51:51,571
right?
What do you make of Australia and 

2451
01:51:51,571 --> 01:51:53,851
ability to instead turn off.
The second thing you are talking about 

2452
01:51:53,851 --> 01:51:54,320
sort of that DNA like your mind and you 
know,

2453
01:51:54,330 --> 01:51:55,920
the possessiveness,
the jealousy,

2454
01:51:55,960 --> 01:51:57,320
all of that.
The whole uh,

2455
01:51:57,340 --> 01:51:58,630
Chris Ryan ability.
What do you mean?

2456
01:51:58,660 --> 01:51:59,120
Well,
you know,

2457
01:51:59,170 --> 01:52:01,530
he sold it to theory about just fucking 
monogamy.

2458
01:52:01,570 --> 01:52:06,010
It's all about happy monkeys having sex 
with each other and just let it be.

2459
01:52:06,370 --> 01:52:11,370
Well,
I think that's something that you can 

2460
01:52:11,370 --> 01:52:11,370
learn.
Yeah,

2461
01:52:11,370 --> 01:52:14,350
I think it's really when you boil down 
to what it really is,

2462
01:52:14,410 --> 01:52:17,610
when you boil it down to,
you know,

2463
01:52:17,620 --> 01:52:20,500
if you can be objective about if it's at
all possible,

2464
01:52:21,030 --> 01:52:23,740
it's a pleasure.
Like why is,

2465
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:27,340
why should you be the only person that 
can give that person pleasure?

2466
01:52:27,370 --> 01:52:30,340
Why should that person be the only place
where you get pleasure?

2467
01:52:30,610 --> 01:52:35,610
Are we slaves to these ancient emotions 
and ancient connections that we have to 

2468
01:52:36,911 --> 01:52:39,790
other human beings that were really 
based on scarcity?

2469
01:52:40,120 --> 01:52:42,010
I think whenever things are based on 
scarcity,

2470
01:52:42,280 --> 01:52:44,080
you know the idea that you'll be alone 
if you don't want.

2471
01:52:44,081 --> 01:52:44,970
I've heard she,
I'll be with them.

2472
01:52:45,660 --> 01:52:50,660
It's like famine thinking.
If that means if I don't eat this meal 

2473
01:52:50,660 --> 01:52:50,660
hills,
we do more meals.

2474
01:52:50,840 --> 01:52:53,030
Does that fam and thinking when it comes
to friends,

2475
01:52:53,031 --> 01:52:55,070
like if you ever have a friend,
like what were you hanging out with them

2476
01:52:55,071 --> 01:52:57,200
for where you fucking even hang out with
me anymore.

2477
01:52:57,560 --> 01:53:00,520
That's the surest way to lose a friend.
Upset.

2478
01:53:00,580 --> 01:53:05,580
What could become like really needy,
where you'd get upset that that friend 

2479
01:53:05,580 --> 01:53:05,630
hangs out with other friends.
That's ridiculous.

2480
01:53:05,810 --> 01:53:08,180
It's crazy.
People like that are ridiculous and I've

2481
01:53:08,181 --> 01:53:10,130
had friends like that before and they 
get it when,

2482
01:53:10,131 --> 01:53:11,390
you know,
only when I was younger.

2483
01:53:11,540 --> 01:53:16,540
When you know,
when you're younger you're sort of 

2484
01:53:16,540 --> 01:53:18,161
figuring out what style of person you 
are and how do you live your life and 

2485
01:53:18,161 --> 01:53:20,450
what's acceptable and what's not 
acceptable and you know,

2486
01:53:20,480 --> 01:53:24,110
the people that are like that,
whether they're aware or not,

2487
01:53:24,111 --> 01:53:29,111
they're just incredibly manipulative.
They might not even be aware of why or 

2488
01:53:29,111 --> 01:53:32,030
what they're doing,
but when it comes to relationships,

2489
01:53:32,031 --> 01:53:35,960
a lot of times people also mirror the 
family that they grew up in.

2490
01:53:36,350 --> 01:53:39,860
Like if you grew up in a really jealous,
really abusive family,

2491
01:53:39,870 --> 01:53:41,360
sure you can,
you can,

2492
01:53:41,450 --> 01:53:43,410
it can mirror itself,
you know,

2493
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:49,000
mirror itself and you or it can be the 
exact opposite where you see how 

2494
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:49,220
retarded your parents were and you're 
like,

2495
01:53:49,221 --> 01:53:50,990
well fuck that.
I'm not going to be like that anymore.

2496
01:53:52,340 --> 01:53:57,340
So I think Chris is obviously a very 
brilliant guy and a Chris Ryan's book.

2497
01:53:58,140 --> 01:53:59,800
It's an excellent book,
which is,

2498
01:54:00,240 --> 01:54:01,790
you know,
really highly respected.

2499
01:54:02,360 --> 01:54:07,040
I think he's got some real good points 
and if you can intellectualize it and be

2500
01:54:07,041 --> 01:54:08,830
objective.
Yeah.

2501
01:54:08,870 --> 01:54:09,710
You know,
if you,

2502
01:54:09,711 --> 01:54:11,960
if you're happy living that life and 
he's happy,

2503
01:54:12,470 --> 01:54:17,470
you know,
and he knows a lot of people that also 

2504
01:54:17,470 --> 01:54:17,470
live like that are happening.
It's nothing wrong with it.

2505
01:54:17,470 --> 01:54:17,470
No,
exactly.

2506
01:54:17,470 --> 01:54:18,110
I mean I,
to me,

2507
01:54:18,450 --> 01:54:19,430
the,
the,

2508
01:54:19,431 --> 01:54:21,230
I recommend he lays out.
Makes perfect sense.

2509
01:54:21,860 --> 01:54:23,690
I think he's right.
He's just a.

2510
01:54:23,900 --> 01:54:26,430
for a lot of people it's hard tool.
Got Overdose.

2511
01:54:27,400 --> 01:54:32,400
They still are possessive and jealous 
and don't have that and they can deal 

2512
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:35,470
with the idea that somebody's date law.
He's supposed to be all me.

2513
01:54:35,480 --> 01:54:36,170
Fuck.
Nice.

2514
01:54:36,171 --> 01:54:38,230
You can't have sex with somebody else.
They flip out.

2515
01:54:38,630 --> 01:54:39,100
But yeah,
with.

2516
01:54:39,110 --> 01:54:41,240
To me when you think about it doesn't 
really make sense.

2517
01:54:41,450 --> 01:54:42,020
Well,
you know,

2518
01:54:42,021 --> 01:54:45,050
what else does it make sense?
Monogamy doesn't make sense,

2519
01:54:45,051 --> 01:54:48,380
but neither does polygamy.
It [inaudible] make sense?

2520
01:54:48,650 --> 01:54:50,060
You should do whatever you want.
Right?

2521
01:54:50,110 --> 01:54:53,060
Like what if you're in monogamy 
monogamy's great.

2522
01:54:53,330 --> 01:54:54,440
That's what I mean.
Exactly.

2523
01:54:54,441 --> 01:54:57,100
If you work for you,
why should ensure way.

2524
01:54:57,320 --> 01:55:02,320
It doesn't work with everyone.
If you find one person and it doesn't 

2525
01:55:02,320 --> 01:55:05,591
work with them,
then that's not the one you should be 

2526
01:55:05,591 --> 01:55:07,811
monogamous with.
But it doesn't mean that you can't be 

2527
01:55:07,811 --> 01:55:09,971
monogamous with somebody else or maybe 
even that same person in another stage 

2528
01:55:09,971 --> 01:55:10,610
of your life.

2529
01:55:10,700 --> 01:55:12,560
You know,
sometimes things change.

2530
01:55:12,650 --> 01:55:14,300
I get a chance.
To me,

2531
01:55:14,780 --> 01:55:18,860
the idea idea is the one that makes the 
most sense and all philosophical.

2532
01:55:19,550 --> 01:55:24,550
But every single dive,
try to throw it out there at the lady I 

2533
01:55:24,550 --> 01:55:25,820
wanted to get into a relationship with 
the discussion.

2534
01:55:25,821 --> 01:55:30,700
Was he variably it makes sense.
Your Pauline's bots can.

2535
01:55:30,990 --> 01:55:31,790
Nope,
sorry.

2536
01:55:31,791 --> 01:55:33,650
It's not going to go.
And then it's a choice,

2537
01:55:33,651 --> 01:55:34,130
right?
He's like,

2538
01:55:34,550 --> 01:55:37,090
do I want it anyway?
Giving these fetal is off.

2539
01:55:37,091 --> 01:55:42,091
He called it sound cooler or not.
And the times when I have gone for 

2540
01:55:42,091 --> 01:55:42,091
eight,
10.

2541
01:55:42,091 --> 01:55:42,440
So he was dead in monogamous 
relationship.

2542
01:55:42,441 --> 01:55:43,740
That's totally with it.
You know,

2543
01:55:43,741 --> 01:55:44,190
it wasn't

2544
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:44,760
like,
oh,

2545
01:55:44,910 --> 01:55:46,800
I spend my days thinking about what are 
missing.

2546
01:55:46,801 --> 01:55:51,801
I was completely happy with it.
So I uncompleted way too dark to me is 

2547
01:55:51,801 --> 01:55:55,770
not a test to be one way or the other is
whatever works at the end of the day,

2548
01:55:55,771 --> 01:56:00,771
but whatever works means.
So having the flexibility to say maybe 

2549
01:56:00,771 --> 01:56:03,830
the traditional monogamous ways,
not the only fucking way to get there 

2550
01:56:03,830 --> 01:56:04,710
are other ways to go about it or just as
good.

2551
01:56:04,920 --> 01:56:09,920
Well,
there certainly are other ways to go 

2552
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:11,751
about it.
I mean there's people that live in the 

2553
01:56:11,751 --> 01:56:11,940
house and it's a man with like three 
women,

2554
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:12,780
right?
You know,

2555
01:56:12,781 --> 01:56:17,730
or a woman with three men and it wasn't 
like a fucking drug dealer moving.

2556
01:56:19,170 --> 01:56:24,170
Wasn't that like an Oliver Stone movie 
where there's a chicken two dudes and 

2557
01:56:24,170 --> 01:56:25,830
they used to have threesomes look so 
stupid.

2558
01:56:25,831 --> 01:56:27,950
So stupid as it looks.
I haven't seen the movie.

2559
01:56:27,960 --> 01:56:29,460
I read the book.
The book was actually awesome.

2560
01:56:29,470 --> 01:56:30,360
Yeah.
The movie,

2561
01:56:30,361 --> 01:56:32,480
I try to watch it.
I quit that.

2562
01:56:33,240 --> 01:56:36,420
It always looks great on paper,
you know,

2563
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:41,480
it's just,
it's very hard for people pull off that 

2564
01:56:41,480 --> 01:56:42,120
open relationship unless they're 
disgusting.

2565
01:56:42,330 --> 01:56:47,330
I'll tell you what you want.
You want to see disgusting people go to 

2566
01:56:47,330 --> 01:56:47,330
a swingers convention.
Oh,

2567
01:56:47,330 --> 01:56:49,210
fucking people are.
He and I were in a,

2568
01:56:49,211 --> 01:56:54,211
I think we're in Nashville and we did a 
whole weekend at this place and we had 

2569
01:56:54,211 --> 01:56:55,350
this guy drives around,
uh,

2570
01:56:55,351 --> 01:56:55,960
you know,
we,

2571
01:56:55,961 --> 01:56:56,400
we,
uh,

2572
01:56:56,440 --> 01:57:01,440
hired a car service and got the same guy
to take us to the airport from the 

2573
01:57:01,440 --> 01:57:05,001
airport and we became friendly with him 
and as he's taken us to the airport at 

2574
01:57:05,001 --> 01:57:09,681
the end of the weekend,
starts opening up about being a swinger 

2575
01:57:10,090 --> 01:57:11,550
out of nowhere.
Man,

2576
01:57:11,660 --> 01:57:13,920
we're fucking driving to the airport.
He goes,

2577
01:57:13,921 --> 01:57:15,690
Hey,
well next time you guys in town,

2578
01:57:15,990 --> 01:57:19,290
I'm be happy to take you to a swinger's 
party.

2579
01:57:19,340 --> 01:57:19,980
We're like,
what?

2580
01:57:20,250 --> 01:57:21,810
Huh?
What are you talking about?

2581
01:57:22,500 --> 01:57:25,890
Dude opens up that uh,
him and his Mrs.

2582
01:57:26,040 --> 01:57:31,040
have this relationship where he can 
decide like whether or not she sleeps 

2583
01:57:31,081 --> 01:57:31,620
with,
uh,

2584
01:57:31,710 --> 01:57:33,180
with other men.
If he can,

2585
01:57:33,181 --> 01:57:35,450
he can give the veto.
Yeah.

2586
01:57:35,850 --> 01:57:37,550
But uh,
diesel out.

2587
01:57:37,620 --> 01:57:38,120
Okay.
Yes.

2588
01:57:38,300 --> 01:57:39,230
That was.
Yeah.

2589
01:57:39,690 --> 01:57:40,380
So I go,
well,

2590
01:57:40,381 --> 01:57:42,620
how do you decide?
He goes on legs,

2591
01:57:42,650 --> 01:57:45,750
someone that just don't know.
I don't want it happening.

2592
01:57:46,050 --> 01:57:46,740
I go like,
what?

2593
01:57:46,741 --> 01:57:51,741
Like some hulking six foot five foot 
ball player with a giant Hog August 

2594
01:57:52,891 --> 01:57:54,720
thick is your calf like,
is that what it is?

2595
01:57:55,140 --> 01:57:56,970
And like he started getting 
uncomfortable and I'm like,

2596
01:57:56,971 --> 01:57:58,470
well how are you?
How can you be uncomfortable man?

2597
01:57:58,471 --> 01:58:00,620
You just open up the doors saying that,
you know,

2598
01:58:00,630 --> 01:58:04,230
like what is it that turns you off about
some Guy Banging your woman?

2599
01:58:04,350 --> 01:58:04,810
Right?
What?

2600
01:58:04,811 --> 01:58:05,970
What's the big deal?

2601
01:58:06,120 --> 01:58:07,230
He could,
he couldn't answer.

2602
01:58:07,260 --> 01:58:12,260
He was starting to that.
We got deep into it with them in the few

2603
01:58:12,780 --> 01:58:14,520
minutes that we had left before we got 
to the airport,

2604
01:58:14,521 --> 01:58:17,290
but we were laughing the entire flight 
home writers,

2605
01:58:17,660 --> 01:58:22,660
guests.
So bar sometime because you get eat the 

2606
01:58:22,660 --> 01:58:22,660
weird that I was with don cutting where,
where are we?

2607
01:58:22,660 --> 01:58:27,370
We call and we got off the plane,
got in this cab and we closed the door.

2608
01:58:27,990 --> 01:58:32,990
The guy started his ball to look right.
It's like there was the cup that I ever 

2609
01:58:32,990 --> 01:58:33,480
started.
Let me tell you about our governor.

2610
01:58:33,640 --> 01:58:38,640
I heard governor socks because he 
started like this 50 minute monologue 

2611
01:58:38,640 --> 01:58:41,130
where he went and taught eddie clearly 
was just eating to get it off his chest.

2612
01:58:41,160 --> 01:58:44,570
What we're looking at each other like 
what the fudge.

2613
01:58:45,240 --> 01:58:49,420
We tell them to shut the fuck up,
but we haven't divided the conversation.

2614
01:58:49,420 --> 01:58:54,420
We are not really participated and he 
just started for a word top to the last 

2615
01:58:54,431 --> 01:58:55,830
cycle.
That's an evolution.

2616
01:58:55,910 --> 01:58:58,090
Like a limo driver in an uber driver 
too.

2617
01:58:58,750 --> 01:59:00,790
Like if you get a limo they kinda like 
they.

2618
01:59:00,820 --> 01:59:03,000
Hello Sir.
Let me open up the car door for you sir.

2619
01:59:03,310 --> 01:59:08,310
It's like there's like,
there's like going to a really nice 

2620
01:59:08,310 --> 01:59:09,040
hotel versus like a shitty motel where 
the,

2621
01:59:09,110 --> 01:59:11,410
the person at the reception is smoking a
cigarette,

2622
01:59:11,820 --> 01:59:14,910
you know,
you get what you pay for that.

2623
01:59:14,911 --> 01:59:16,760
Again,
a bucket.

2624
01:59:16,780 --> 01:59:20,600
He managed to use that material for.
I called him Eddie beat that he was also

2625
01:59:20,860 --> 01:59:22,210
he.
So I was like,

2626
01:59:22,211 --> 01:59:23,060
Hey,
look at that.

2627
01:59:24,050 --> 01:59:26,530
Totally shifted conversation and come 
out with these.

2628
01:59:26,760 --> 01:59:28,050
Awesome.
Well,

2629
01:59:28,060 --> 01:59:33,060
yeah,
if someone's completely retarded or 

2630
01:59:33,060 --> 01:59:33,060
someone's completely out of whack,
you could definitely make a good,

2631
01:59:33,060 --> 01:59:36,130
a good sketch about it.
This guy in Nashville,

2632
01:59:36,131 --> 01:59:37,330
I still think about this guy.

2633
01:59:37,390 --> 01:59:42,390
Every time I go there,
I'm just hoping I get him as a driver 

2634
01:59:42,390 --> 01:59:45,150
just like it's so what?
Give me an update man I haven't seen in 

2635
01:59:45,150 --> 01:59:45,360
a couple of years.
How's it all working out?

2636
01:59:46,040 --> 01:59:47,410
That will be awesome.
Yeah,

2637
01:59:47,411 --> 01:59:49,430
I'm back there in May.
I'm in uh,

2638
01:59:49,570 --> 01:59:51,250
May 19th,
I think,

2639
01:59:51,251 --> 01:59:53,650
or 20th.
I'm in Nashville,

2640
01:59:53,710 --> 01:59:58,710
so I hope I'll find that dude.
I'm really thinking about everybody.

2641
01:59:58,860 --> 01:59:59,890
Everybody.
Nashville,

2642
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:03,140
please ask your cup.
I've heard what they seek about swinging

2643
02:00:03,150 --> 02:00:03,990
gate.
If you'll catch that.

2644
02:00:03,991 --> 02:00:08,991
I guy send him back to Joel to pick him 
up at the airport because they have 

2645
02:00:08,991 --> 02:00:10,450
clubs that go to.
They have specific swinging clubs.

2646
02:00:11,210 --> 02:00:11,710
I'm like,
well,

2647
02:00:11,740 --> 02:00:13,420
how does that work?
So I could everybody just,

2648
02:00:13,421 --> 02:00:14,790
you know,
sits on people's labs.

2649
02:00:14,810 --> 02:00:16,260
You go to people and.
But,

2650
02:00:16,290 --> 02:00:18,550
but they all probably looked like him.
He looked disgusting,

2651
02:00:18,990 --> 02:00:21,580
you know,
he's like a balding dude with a ponytail

2652
02:00:21,581 --> 02:00:26,581
and he was tall,
but he had a gut and like it was just 

2653
02:00:26,581 --> 02:00:27,250
skinny,
but fat six,

2654
02:00:27,320 --> 02:00:28,230
I was also bored.

2655
02:00:28,240 --> 02:00:31,950
You have your playboy.
Does everybody look like they are out of

2656
02:00:32,640 --> 02:00:37,640
that?
That it's awesome to see the reality or 

2657
02:00:37,640 --> 02:00:39,820
like,
oh that totally sucks.

2658
02:00:40,300 --> 02:00:45,300
Yeah.
The reality is most people that want to 

2659
02:00:45,300 --> 02:00:48,091
do that,
they don't have a whole lot of other 

2660
02:00:48,091 --> 02:00:50,020
options,
but there's probably only like one super

2661
02:00:50,021 --> 02:00:53,620
hot slutty girl that goes to those 
things just loves being the Belle of the

2662
02:00:53,621 --> 02:00:58,621
ball because if you go to like a 
swingers thing and you're actually hot 

2663
02:00:58,621 --> 02:01:02,830
or hot girl if everybody wants you.
Do you remember there was a showtime 

2664
02:01:02,830 --> 02:01:06,751
show for awhile about people that were 
involved and like these big swinging 

2665
02:01:07,720 --> 02:01:11,560
sort of relationships now why was.
It was terrible show,

2666
02:01:11,561 --> 02:01:16,561
but it was,
it was really weird because they would 

2667
02:01:16,561 --> 02:01:16,780
show them getting together and making 
out and doing all this stuff together,

2668
02:01:16,781 --> 02:01:21,781
but it was like this obviously like 
really well lit room while they were 

2669
02:01:21,781 --> 02:01:22,120
filming,
you know,

2670
02:01:22,121 --> 02:01:23,440
because there was cameras on me.

2671
02:01:23,440 --> 02:01:24,910
These people were supposed to like,
okay,

2672
02:01:24,911 --> 02:01:26,050
everybody act normal.
Yeah,

2673
02:01:26,051 --> 02:01:31,051
exactly.
It's like the comment off prs was these 

2674
02:01:31,051 --> 02:01:31,051
other reality show or something.
Yeah.

2675
02:01:31,190 --> 02:01:31,750
Huh?
Yeah.

2676
02:01:31,751 --> 02:01:33,380
It was on showtime.
No.

2677
02:01:33,730 --> 02:01:34,780
Yeah,
it was just,

2678
02:01:34,810 --> 02:01:39,810
it was a polyamorous show you found it 
was called polyamory.

2679
02:01:40,640 --> 02:01:41,330
Yeah.
That was it.

2680
02:01:41,560 --> 02:01:46,560
It was gross.
Get out of there with that very 

2681
02:01:47,180 --> 02:01:48,530
monitored family.
Okay.

2682
02:01:48,650 --> 02:01:51,380
It's not modern had been doing that 
forever.

2683
02:01:51,710 --> 02:01:52,520
Okay.
It's just,

2684
02:01:52,580 --> 02:01:57,580
it's odd,
but there's always like one dude who's 

2685
02:01:57,580 --> 02:01:57,580
like,
you know,

2686
02:01:57,580 --> 02:02:00,440
just like this is way people should be,
man.

2687
02:02:00,860 --> 02:02:03,680
They should just relax and just enjoy 
each other's company.

2688
02:02:03,681 --> 02:02:05,720
Man.
To me,

2689
02:02:05,721 --> 02:02:08,260
that's the thing is I fuck shoulder.
There's no shoulder.

2690
02:02:08,960 --> 02:02:10,710
Whatever your rapid weight,
if he works for you,

2691
02:02:10,711 --> 02:02:11,770
it works for you.
Exactly.

2692
02:02:12,120 --> 02:02:12,600
I know.
Star,

2693
02:02:12,770 --> 02:02:14,960
it gives a shit.
Do whatever you want.

2694
02:02:15,380 --> 02:02:19,880
What makes you happy?
That doesn't fuck over everyone else.

2695
02:02:19,940 --> 02:02:21,950
That's for anyone else or the 
environment,

2696
02:02:22,370 --> 02:02:25,670
but people can say that you.
If you want to fucking open relationship

2697
02:02:25,671 --> 02:02:28,130
and fucks over my life.
Danieli,

2698
02:02:28,610 --> 02:02:31,880
do you understand?
I need a man,

2699
02:02:31,881 --> 02:02:35,060
a real man,
a man who doesn't want another woman?

2700
02:02:35,090 --> 02:02:37,250
You should.
It shouldn't be a compromise.

2701
02:02:37,370 --> 02:02:42,370
Should be.
You want to stack of romance novels and 

2702
02:02:42,370 --> 02:02:46,550
lives based on this fucking artificial 
narrative created by fiction writers.

2703
02:02:47,270 --> 02:02:49,400
Fucking fiction.
I hate that shit,

2704
02:02:49,640 --> 02:02:51,560
but what about those 50 shades of Grey 
bitches?

2705
02:02:51,670 --> 02:02:56,670
I don't find those because that's an 
untapped freak vein out there in 

2706
02:02:56,670 --> 02:02:57,050
America.
A big one,

2707
02:02:57,110 --> 02:03:02,110
big one.
A lot of chicks want to get choked and 

2708
02:03:02,110 --> 02:03:02,110
they're just not getting choked.
What is that about,

2709
02:03:02,110 --> 02:03:05,510
man that I don't get?
We don't get it and we never will.

2710
02:03:05,750 --> 02:03:09,440
That's the male female dynamic,
unfettered,

2711
02:03:09,530 --> 02:03:14,480
unrestrained that we don't understand.
Never got understand it.

2712
02:03:14,570 --> 02:03:19,570
Some of that shit is entirely above.
I want you to try the wrap your head 

2713
02:03:19,570 --> 02:03:22,721
around this mental exercise.
Imagine you're a woman who is going to 

2714
02:03:22,970 --> 02:03:27,970
take a condom.
The guy came in and squirt the contents 

2715
02:03:27,970 --> 02:03:31,211
inside your pussy or not.
I can't imagine it.

2716
02:03:32,231 --> 02:03:33,920
No,
but those people were real.

2717
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:35,750
Yeah.
So imagine that.

2718
02:03:35,751 --> 02:03:37,790
A man who doesn't want to have a baby 
with you,

2719
02:03:37,791 --> 02:03:39,350
but you want to have to pay with this 
motherfucker.

2720
02:03:40,220 --> 02:03:45,220
How do I do this?
I'm going to take the condom and stuff 

2721
02:03:45,220 --> 02:03:45,390
in my posting.
Number it down and I'm gonna.

2722
02:03:45,391 --> 02:03:50,391
Get my fingers in there and I'm a 
fucking shove it in there and we'll try 

2723
02:03:50,391 --> 02:03:53,051
to.
I'm sure people have gotten pregnant 

2724
02:03:53,051 --> 02:03:53,051
that way,
right?

2725
02:03:53,051 --> 02:03:53,600
I'm sure you all pregnancy to all 
condoms.

2726
02:03:53,601 --> 02:03:54,950
Come with spermicide.
A lot of them do,

2727
02:03:54,960 --> 02:03:59,960
right?
The little sperm side in the kills them 

2728
02:03:59,960 --> 02:04:00,350
little fuckers.

2729
02:04:00,740 --> 02:04:05,740
Wow.
That's some weird fucking people out 

2730
02:04:05,740 --> 02:04:05,740
there.
Right?

2731
02:04:05,740 --> 02:04:10,030
But that's a human thing.
Like there's people that want to be 

2732
02:04:10,030 --> 02:04:12,050
connected so badly to someone that 
they'll lie about being on the pill.

2733
02:04:13,150 --> 02:04:16,490
Like I've had friends that uh,
they were having sex with a girl and the

2734
02:04:16,491 --> 02:04:17,870
girl's like,
I just don't,

2735
02:04:18,050 --> 02:04:19,670
I'm not on the pill,
but just so you can pull out.

2736
02:04:19,760 --> 02:04:21,320
So they'll google,
you know,

2737
02:04:21,321 --> 02:04:25,190
when you dicks hard,
you have like 10 percent mental capacity

2738
02:04:25,460 --> 02:04:26,810
that you're operating on.
Right.

2739
02:04:27,140 --> 02:04:32,140
And so they tried to pull out and the 
girl wrap their legs around him and 

2740
02:04:32,140 --> 02:04:33,190
wouldn't let him pull out serious.
Yeah.

2741
02:04:34,160 --> 02:04:37,070
Yeah.
More than one guys had that happen.

2742
02:04:37,450 --> 02:04:39,590
I've talked to more than one guy happen.
Yeah,

2743
02:04:40,020 --> 02:04:42,010
I've heard like the,
you know,

2744
02:04:42,030 --> 02:04:44,610
I'm on the pl where it's bullshit and 
they get pregnant.

2745
02:04:46,060 --> 02:04:46,650
No,
I haven't.

2746
02:04:46,651 --> 02:04:48,900
Third is one weird trick.

2747
02:04:48,900 --> 02:04:53,900
Pregnancy is fucking crazy cause it's,
it's terrifying that not only did you 

2748
02:04:53,900 --> 02:04:56,700
fuck up so hard that you got someone 
pregnant,

2749
02:04:56,701 --> 02:04:59,400
you didn't want to get pregnant,
but they tricked you.

2750
02:04:59,490 --> 02:05:01,880
They lied to you.
And this,

2751
02:05:01,900 --> 02:05:04,620
this is the type of person that you now 
have a child with.

2752
02:05:04,830 --> 02:05:07,200
So you have to raise a child with a 
liar,

2753
02:05:07,680 --> 02:05:11,280
a manipulative liar who decided to get 
pregnant.

2754
02:05:11,770 --> 02:05:13,320
Ooh Boy.
Oh yeah.

2755
02:05:13,321 --> 02:05:18,321
There's a couple of nitinol weird.
That's the lady got pregnant team time 

2756
02:05:18,321 --> 02:05:20,550
shortly after telling him,
oh no,

2757
02:05:20,551 --> 02:05:25,551
no chance in hell.
And then of course he dcs under the 

2758
02:05:25,551 --> 02:05:29,421
file.
This is the perfect family that then 

2759
02:05:29,421 --> 02:05:29,910
they tell their kids never have sex 
before marriage,

2760
02:05:29,911 --> 02:05:30,240
Dah,
Dah,

2761
02:05:30,241 --> 02:05:30,890
Dah,
and they were.

2762
02:05:31,170 --> 02:05:34,110
I remember talking with their kid like 
the kid was like 14.

2763
02:05:34,111 --> 02:05:36,160
I was telling me all about,
oh shit,

2764
02:05:36,180 --> 02:05:40,020
but they say no sex before marriage,
ds and dace stocked with.

2765
02:05:40,050 --> 02:05:40,570
And I'm like,
no,

2766
02:05:40,571 --> 02:05:45,571
they didn't.
Technical mind was bugging guys like my 

2767
02:05:45,781 --> 02:05:49,200
mom and dad met in Bible class and my 
mom was pure.

2768
02:05:49,650 --> 02:05:51,150
The guy flipped.
He was like,

2769
02:05:51,151 --> 02:05:51,960
serious.
I'm like,

2770
02:05:51,961 --> 02:05:53,050
yeah,
I don't lie to you.

2771
02:05:53,051 --> 02:05:54,320
It's,
that's where it sets.

2772
02:05:54,340 --> 02:05:55,820
But at he was like,
oh,

2773
02:05:55,830 --> 02:05:57,360
holy shit.
I was like,

2774
02:05:57,361 --> 02:05:58,380
yeah man,
I'm sorry.

2775
02:05:58,440 --> 02:06:01,170
They just fed you a bunch of bullshit,
but at least you've got relaxed.

2776
02:06:01,171 --> 02:06:03,350
The Dep secs now just,
you know,

2777
02:06:04,950 --> 02:06:09,950
just the idea that some of them would be
so many nipples and so self centered 

2778
02:06:09,950 --> 02:06:13,500
that they would decide to have a baby 
with someone against that person's will.

2779
02:06:13,590 --> 02:06:14,850
Now that's,
that's when you know,

2780
02:06:14,851 --> 02:06:16,440
you see it as live problems,
you know,

2781
02:06:16,441 --> 02:06:18,610
that's where we are mentally fucked in 
the head.

2782
02:06:19,610 --> 02:06:23,160
You're not just mentally fucked.
You're now connected to this person.

2783
02:06:23,161 --> 02:06:25,820
You're you,
you like that you've,

2784
02:06:25,910 --> 02:06:28,680
you're not just mentally fucked and 
manipulative and evil,

2785
02:06:28,681 --> 02:06:31,580
but you're connected to a person who had
a baby with you know,

2786
02:06:31,620 --> 02:06:32,950
and it was all because you live.

2787
02:06:34,740 --> 02:06:36,030
It was weird.
It's weird.

2788
02:06:36,330 --> 02:06:41,330
Sex is weird because it's,
it makes people feel good.

2789
02:06:42,570 --> 02:06:44,910
Like if it was just like hugging or just
like,

2790
02:06:44,911 --> 02:06:49,911
you know,
being affectionate and just making out 

2791
02:06:49,911 --> 02:06:49,911
and like,
oh,

2792
02:06:49,911 --> 02:06:53,061
that's all great,
but it makes people like blow jobs don't

2793
02:06:53,131 --> 02:06:55,200
make people,
they're awesome,

2794
02:06:55,770 --> 02:07:00,770
but they do not make people.
Fucking actually makes people like what 

2795
02:07:01,231 --> 02:07:04,470
a bizarre way of reproducing that be 
about it.

2796
02:07:04,740 --> 02:07:07,590
Like you're drawn to someone you can't 
live without them.

2797
02:07:07,591 --> 02:07:12,591
The touches so magical.
Find your person what ridiculous.

2798
02:07:15,660 --> 02:07:20,660
That's when you got to see that the 
universe has been designed by somebody 

2799
02:07:20,660 --> 02:07:23,541
with them.
Lots of sense of your worry if there is 

2800
02:07:23,541 --> 02:07:23,541
any design behind it because he's like 
so much of a shit.

2801
02:07:23,541 --> 02:07:24,250
He's just fun.
It's just like,

2802
02:07:25,130 --> 02:07:26,610
it's funny,
but it all makes sense.

2803
02:07:26,611 --> 02:07:31,611
I mean this the only way to really truly
ensure that people have sex when times 

2804
02:07:32,101 --> 02:07:37,101
are tough and you know the world is 
rough and logically and intellectually 

2805
02:07:37,391 --> 02:07:42,391
you wouldn't have a baby,
but you have a baby and you have to 

2806
02:07:42,391 --> 02:07:44,760
figure out a way to hide it from the 
barbarian hordes because you love it so 

2807
02:07:44,760 --> 02:07:48,421
much and you have these urges and 
meanwhile the reason why the barbarian 

2808
02:07:48,421 --> 02:07:49,360
hordes are showing up in the first place
because they're looking for pussy.

2809
02:07:50,020 --> 02:07:53,180
So little things crazy.
That's the when he studied,

2810
02:07:53,190 --> 02:07:57,220
what does it show?
Some condoms use to contain spermicides,

2811
02:07:57,221 --> 02:08:02,221
but most don't.
It's best to use condoms without 

2812
02:08:02,221 --> 02:08:02,440
spermicide says who?
The person who wants babies.

2813
02:08:02,441 --> 02:08:03,190
You fuck

2814
02:08:03,260 --> 02:08:07,300
it says the most looking at right now.
So spermicide can actually increase.

2815
02:08:07,400 --> 02:08:12,400
Chances of sti is such as HIV chlamydia 
because it can cause the irritation 

2816
02:08:14,001 --> 02:08:17,510
which can lead to the rubbing and blood 
shadow.

2817
02:08:17,590 --> 02:08:18,610
Maybe on your Dick,
Bro.

2818
02:08:19,310 --> 02:08:20,440
Not Mine.
My,

2819
02:08:20,470 --> 02:08:20,890
my,
my,

2820
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:22,600
my Dick Lapses.
Promissory,

2821
02:08:23,740 --> 02:08:24,780
my digs.
Like whatever bro.

2822
02:08:25,510 --> 02:08:27,730
But um,
if you have like Lambskin,

2823
02:08:28,390 --> 02:08:30,940
I think lambskin condoms,
you can get pregnant anyway.

2824
02:08:30,941 --> 02:08:35,941
Like the ges can get through those 
things and I definitely know the 

2825
02:08:35,941 --> 02:08:40,321
diseases can.
I thought there was no pregnancy by yes 

2826
02:08:40,321 --> 02:08:43,591
diseases.
I want to know how when heterosexual 

2827
02:08:43,591 --> 02:08:46,390
people like Charlie Sheen gets HIV.
Come on Charlie,

2828
02:08:46,530 --> 02:08:49,330
you come clean about everything.
What were you doing?

2829
02:08:50,200 --> 02:08:51,580
I want to know what you were doing.
Right?

2830
02:08:51,760 --> 02:08:54,310
We share needles with somebody.
Like what were you doing?

2831
02:08:54,311 --> 02:08:55,810
Did you take it in the booty?
Right?

2832
02:08:56,010 --> 02:08:58,780
What were you doing?
There's no shame in your game,

2833
02:08:58,880 --> 02:08:59,310
right?
Man.

2834
02:08:59,510 --> 02:09:01,420
Come clean.
Come clean.

2835
02:09:02,020 --> 02:09:04,600
The problem is that he charged the case.
I don't think he burst.

2836
02:09:05,120 --> 02:09:06,760
No,
I'm sure I did.

2837
02:09:06,761 --> 02:09:09,010
Sad thing,
but who knows?

2838
02:09:09,400 --> 02:09:13,420
He's so hilarious because when he came 
out and talked about it,

2839
02:09:13,421 --> 02:09:15,730
it wasn't like he wants to set the 
record straight.

2840
02:09:15,910 --> 02:09:17,590
He just doesn't want to pay anybody 
anymore,

2841
02:09:18,040 --> 02:09:23,040
so he decided to just to put up,
put a stop to all the financial bleeding

2842
02:09:23,800 --> 02:09:25,090
that was going on in his life.

2843
02:09:27,910 --> 02:09:30,220
That's a.
that's an interesting tale.

2844
02:09:30,250 --> 02:09:35,250
The Charlie Sheen tale because it went 
from a tale of sort of almost like 

2845
02:09:35,250 --> 02:09:38,330
heroic excess to like a sadness thing.
Yeah.

2846
02:09:38,700 --> 02:09:40,240
Victim ever.
See his teeth?

2847
02:09:40,640 --> 02:09:42,630
No,
like falling out of his head.

2848
02:09:42,810 --> 02:09:44,290
Yeah.
Yeah.

2849
02:09:44,330 --> 02:09:47,530
There's photos or I dunno.
I guess smoking cracks.

2850
02:09:47,531 --> 02:09:48,810
Not good for your teeth.
Yeah,

2851
02:09:48,850 --> 02:09:51,560
I would imagine.
I would guess that Fox and CNN,

2852
02:09:52,270 --> 02:09:57,270
one of his girls that he used to date 
says fucking teeth are all falling out 

2853
02:09:57,270 --> 02:09:58,300
and then if you see him when he smiles 
he smiles like this.

2854
02:09:58,310 --> 02:10:00,390
Like it's Kinda like his,
his lips are cold,

2855
02:10:00,430 --> 02:10:02,140
curled over his teeth.
He like,

2856
02:10:02,410 --> 02:10:03,110
yeah.
It's like,

2857
02:10:03,130 --> 02:10:08,130
it seems fun when you hear about it.
He's doing blow and that's how he rolls 

2858
02:10:08,130 --> 02:10:12,721
and he's having hookers and.
But then at the end of it you realized 

2859
02:10:12,721 --> 02:10:12,721
like,
Oh,

2860
02:10:12,721 --> 02:10:13,630
this guy is probably like completely out
of control.

2861
02:10:14,610 --> 02:10:18,520
You know,
I'm probably a slave to these chemicals,

2862
02:10:18,550 --> 02:10:23,550
but also talented enough that he can 
figure out a way to make absorb it and 

2863
02:10:24,271 --> 02:10:27,970
amounts of money and he has really smart
people behind them because you went from

2864
02:10:27,971 --> 02:10:31,540
that two and a half men show where he 
made exorbitant amounts of money to this

2865
02:10:32,050 --> 02:10:34,250
other show,
which was a terrible show.

2866
02:10:34,280 --> 02:10:35,350
Which one was it?
To?

2867
02:10:35,630 --> 02:10:37,310
Anger management.
Oh yeah.

2868
02:10:37,311 --> 02:10:42,311
Terrible Shell.
But he got an insane deal where they 

2869
02:10:42,311 --> 02:10:43,910
filmed all 100 episodes,
like really quickly.

2870
02:10:43,911 --> 02:10:46,220
And so he made hundreds of millions of 
dollars.

2871
02:10:46,250 --> 02:10:47,990
They were afraid it would end the 
traveling.

2872
02:10:48,140 --> 02:10:48,800
No,
it's um,

2873
02:10:49,280 --> 02:10:50,850
it's a thing where you,
um,

2874
02:10:51,190 --> 02:10:56,190
it's like a guaranteed syndication deal 
where if they did that they would do 

2875
02:10:56,190 --> 02:10:58,940
like a 10 90,
like the way that the show would work.

2876
02:10:59,060 --> 02:11:04,060
Like you would do 13 episodes and then 
you would do the back nine and the back 

2877
02:11:04,060 --> 02:11:05,900
nine would equal 22,
which is a real season.

2878
02:11:06,050 --> 02:11:11,050
So like when we first did news radio,
I think the first season we did like 13 

2879
02:11:11,050 --> 02:11:11,210
episodes.
And then if you get a pickup,

2880
02:11:11,240 --> 02:11:13,670
everybody gets excited.
Oh we got to pick up for the back nine.

2881
02:11:14,090 --> 02:11:18,020
So would they decided to do inside 
instead of that was due a 10 90.

2882
02:11:18,620 --> 02:11:23,120
So you do the first 10 episodes and the 
first 10 episodes go well you get picked

2883
02:11:23,121 --> 02:11:25,040
up for the full hundred.
Yeah.

2884
02:11:25,041 --> 02:11:26,330
So the idea is like,
look,

2885
02:11:26,331 --> 02:11:28,550
we've got a hit on our hands,
let's negotiate accordingly.

2886
02:11:28,610 --> 02:11:30,200
Let's go.
We got Charlie Sheen,

2887
02:11:30,201 --> 02:11:35,201
I don't know if you know,
but Charlie Sheen was a big part of 

2888
02:11:35,201 --> 02:11:37,570
anger or two and a half men made 
billions of dollars for the network and 

2889
02:11:37,570 --> 02:11:38,720
we can do the same thing for you fx and 
so they,

2890
02:11:38,721 --> 02:11:42,140
they bought hook line and sinker into 
this deal and it just fucking went right

2891
02:11:42,141 --> 02:11:46,380
into the shit to her.
No success whatsoever.

2892
02:11:46,381 --> 02:11:48,610
Like it was just that not only talk 
about,

2893
02:11:48,620 --> 02:11:53,620
nobody watched it or what to a good 
question because I imagine watching the 

2894
02:11:53,620 --> 02:11:57,290
beginning watch artist just because it's
like a train wreck about the weapon.

2895
02:11:57,460 --> 02:12:00,290
Well,
it was not a bad show at first.

2896
02:12:00,590 --> 02:12:04,060
It was one of those shows where people 
watched it and it got like those.

2897
02:12:04,400 --> 02:12:06,110
It's hard to do a good Sitcom,
man.

2898
02:12:06,111 --> 02:12:11,111
There's not a lot of good writers.
You have to have really good dedicated 

2899
02:12:11,111 --> 02:12:14,381
writers that are funny and then you have
to have an actor who knows how to pull 

2900
02:12:14,381 --> 02:12:15,290
it off.
You have to have a show runner who's got

2901
02:12:15,291 --> 02:12:16,910
experience and putting those things 
together.

2902
02:12:17,210 --> 02:12:20,330
There's an art form to creating a sitcom
all,

2903
02:12:20,390 --> 02:12:22,040
all itself.
You know,

2904
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:26,750
I was on one for five years and I got to
see it pretty intimately from a bunch of

2905
02:12:26,751 --> 02:12:31,751
different levels,
from like the level of like really 

2906
02:12:31,751 --> 02:12:34,361
talented,
really smart actors who configure out 

2907
02:12:34,361 --> 02:12:38,351
how to manipulate a scene and make it 
funny and the level of really smart and 

2908
02:12:38,351 --> 02:12:42,851
really good writers who really know how 
to craft a scene and then networks with 

2909
02:12:42,861 --> 02:12:47,861
good ideas and networks with shit ideas 
and then you've got to put them all 

2910
02:12:47,861 --> 02:12:50,390
together and good luck and then you have
to back then you had to have a good time

2911
02:12:50,391 --> 02:12:50,900
slot to.

2912
02:12:50,900 --> 02:12:54,010
That was a big part of it because Peter 
had to know that you were on it.

2913
02:12:54,011 --> 02:12:55,670
Gay Now times have changed,
right?

2914
02:12:55,671 --> 02:12:59,270
Nobody cares about it anymore.
It's just not even an issue,

2915
02:12:59,420 --> 02:13:02,300
but that's why Netflix has got it down.
Watch it whenever you want.

2916
02:13:02,330 --> 02:13:04,610
Not only that,
the whole season comes out at once.

2917
02:13:04,660 --> 02:13:07,640
That's of photo.
That's the best way I can watch seeing.

2918
02:13:07,641 --> 02:13:09,140
So one episode,
one week,

2919
02:13:09,150 --> 02:13:10,010
one episode,
the next.

2920
02:13:10,011 --> 02:13:15,011
That to me is bullshit.
I wait for them to be able to just tune 

2921
02:13:15,011 --> 02:13:16,120
spoilers out and if I cashed out for gas
anyway,

2922
02:13:16,140 --> 02:13:21,140
doesn't matter.
Engine just being donate once it comes 

2923
02:13:21,140 --> 02:13:23,090
out with and just watch every single to 
30 days and be done with it.

2924
02:13:23,240 --> 02:13:23,940
I don't know.
I watch,

2925
02:13:23,941 --> 02:13:26,930
um,
I watch walking dead every week.

2926
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:31,800
You're watching it on TV.
I don't watch it.

2927
02:13:31,801 --> 02:13:36,801
Like while it's on tv,
I'll watch it on itunes the next day 

2928
02:13:36,801 --> 02:13:36,801
I'll watch on appletv.

2929
02:13:36,801 --> 02:13:38,880
I wait for them.
Fuck those commercials.

2930
02:13:39,240 --> 02:13:44,240
That's ridiculous.
What do I have to pay five bucks to not 

2931
02:13:44,240 --> 02:13:44,420
have a commercial?
Fuck you.

2932
02:13:44,860 --> 02:13:49,860
That's it.
My time is way more valuable than those 

2933
02:13:49,860 --> 02:13:53,120
15 minute chunks where you just 
interrupt with stupid music and dancing 

2934
02:13:53,120 --> 02:13:55,260
frogs or whatever the fuck is Geico 
then.

2935
02:13:55,280 --> 02:13:56,610
Oh,
I'm selling insurance.

2936
02:13:56,611 --> 02:13:59,130
Fuck.
He's just ruined a Zombie show.

2937
02:13:59,820 --> 02:14:02,970
You've ruined the show is awesome.
It's a good show.

2938
02:14:03,270 --> 02:14:06,960
It gets better one with the La one.
I saw that one.

2939
02:14:07,020 --> 02:14:10,050
The walking dead.
They only did a few episodes,

2940
02:14:10,051 --> 02:14:15,051
but it's well really well directed and 
well shot show and really well acted d.

2941
02:14:15,131 --> 02:14:16,600
only thing I agree with you,
I said,

2942
02:14:16,740 --> 02:14:18,330
awesome.
It's very well done.

2943
02:14:18,390 --> 02:14:21,210
The only thing I didn't dig where the 
characters,

2944
02:14:21,211 --> 02:14:26,211
you know the character stuff,
the main story of the walking dead or 

2945
02:14:26,211 --> 02:14:27,420
something cool characters that you dig,
that you care about them.

2946
02:14:28,230 --> 02:14:33,230
These guys,
you've kind of want them to all get 

2947
02:14:33,230 --> 02:14:35,241
eaten by zombies.
Don't fuck about Daniel for them.

2948
02:14:35,281 --> 02:14:38,850
They are all like,
I want the woman to freak out.

2949
02:14:38,880 --> 02:14:40,370
She doesn't seem to freak out.
Very.

2950
02:14:40,820 --> 02:14:41,390
Yes.
Yeah.

2951
02:14:41,400 --> 02:14:46,400
She's almost to calm.
She should be shitting her pants for 

2952
02:14:46,400 --> 02:14:46,830
eating people all around you,
bitch.

2953
02:14:46,860 --> 02:14:51,860
Your neighbors are monsters.
They haven't turned into a Zombie 

2954
02:14:51,860 --> 02:14:51,860
looking either.
They're like,

2955
02:14:51,860 --> 02:14:56,570
they haven't deteriorated enough yet.
The beginning with the steel looks 

2956
02:14:56,570 --> 02:14:58,440
mostly human.
I'd like it though.

2957
02:14:58,800 --> 02:15:01,350
I think it takes time to develop those 
characters,

2958
02:15:01,351 --> 02:15:03,930
but like as far as the way it's shot and
acted,

2959
02:15:03,931 --> 02:15:07,740
it seems like it's Daniella.
We're almost out of time,

2960
02:15:07,741 --> 02:15:09,240
my friend.
I got to get the fuck out of here.

2961
02:15:09,390 --> 02:15:10,500
Cool.
What else is going on?

2962
02:15:10,501 --> 02:15:15,501
What should I tell?
I tell people about history on fire for 

2963
02:15:15,501 --> 02:15:15,501
sure.
You're amazing podcast.

2964
02:15:15,501 --> 02:15:16,620
Thank you,
my man and you,

2965
02:15:16,621 --> 02:15:21,621
uh,
you opened up first episode with that 

2966
02:15:21,621 --> 02:15:21,621
first episode,
but episode,

2967
02:15:21,621 --> 02:15:25,640
not zero,
but episode one was with one of my 

2968
02:15:25,640 --> 02:15:27,720
favorite stories you've ever told that 
fucked up story about the crucifixions.

2969
02:15:27,780 --> 02:15:32,780
I feel it's a fucking of stories.
The latest one I think was episode five 

2970
02:15:32,780 --> 02:15:34,830
as a story to make it a crucifixion look
like at these Ne Bowlby.

2971
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:37,050
What is it about a,
there's a story.

2972
02:15:37,200 --> 02:15:40,590
It's a complicated long story,
but to go for the essential element,

2973
02:15:40,591 --> 02:15:45,591
there's like these two Persian brothers 
were putting sis who are fighting for 

2974
02:15:45,591 --> 02:15:49,890
days in the CV of the water for power 
and I'm the mom of both of the guys.

2975
02:15:49,891 --> 02:15:51,600
He speaks to and off them and get 
killed.

2976
02:15:51,601 --> 02:15:56,601
And so at one point she's already pissed
off and she wants the guy who actually 

2977
02:15:56,601 --> 02:15:59,721
killed their son to be executed,
but she can't ready to go through a 

2978
02:15:59,721 --> 02:15:59,721
rather song and say execute this 
motherfucker.

2979
02:15:59,721 --> 02:16:02,730
Because he was doing,
he was obeying and so orders.

2980
02:16:02,731 --> 02:16:05,610
Right?
So she find a way for him to fuck up for

2981
02:16:05,611 --> 02:16:08,870
him to say something that will piss off 
or rather than the king.

2982
02:16:09,360 --> 02:16:11,280
And then the way the execute this 
annuity is,

2983
02:16:11,281 --> 02:16:16,281
they put me in a box,
we thought he said he saw her Monday 

2984
02:16:16,281 --> 02:16:17,670
slags sticking out with buddies,
sold baldies property bulks.

2985
02:16:18,060 --> 02:16:23,060
They force feed him horny and other 
weird shit that for the next few days 

2986
02:16:23,640 --> 02:16:25,080
the guy is being forced,
fed,

2987
02:16:25,320 --> 02:16:27,360
started shooting all over inside the 
bulks.

2988
02:16:27,690 --> 02:16:30,130
These tracks matt goats like flies the 
lay

2989
02:16:30,240 --> 02:16:35,240
magazine there and stuff.
And he literally started walking their 

2990
02:16:35,240 --> 02:16:37,500
way inside of him.
So he has maggots hatching inside of him

2991
02:16:37,501 --> 02:16:42,501
and meeting him for the next two weeks 
and they're file happy tails from the 

2992
02:16:42,950 --> 02:16:47,950
award.
The kind of crazy shit that you want to 

2993
02:16:47,950 --> 02:16:47,950
be.
I mean,

2994
02:16:47,950 --> 02:16:48,550
what a crazy mother fuckers sit down and
think,

2995
02:16:49,180 --> 02:16:51,340
I want to kill somebody,
but I don't just want to kill him.

2996
02:16:51,520 --> 02:16:56,520
Let's figure out in a slow torture 
method of killing someone that's pretty 

2997
02:16:58,240 --> 02:16:59,230
fucking weird.

2998
02:17:00,010 --> 02:17:05,010
God damn creative.
You look at what they did during the 

2999
02:17:05,010 --> 02:17:07,701
inquisition,
all the different ways that killed 

3000
02:17:07,701 --> 02:17:07,701
people.
Yup.

3001
02:17:07,701 --> 02:17:07,701
Yup,

3002
02:17:07,701 --> 02:17:12,140
yeah,
the game of thrones one where they put 

3003
02:17:12,140 --> 02:17:14,321
the rat on your stomach,
put up late on a light that's a through 

3004
02:17:14,321 --> 02:17:14,510
star.
That's like inquisition stuff.

3005
02:17:14,511 --> 02:17:19,511
They did that for real,
but actually just so not all of his 

3006
02:17:20,770 --> 02:17:25,770
thrill fireys about crazy stuff that are
actually some pleasant stories here and 

3007
02:17:25,770 --> 02:17:25,770
there,
but yeah,

3008
02:17:25,770 --> 02:17:29,060
of course they weird moments.
Our data as well.

3009
02:17:30,380 --> 02:17:35,380
There's one that you would dig.
I think the episode three was about the 

3010
02:17:35,380 --> 02:17:37,430
iceman to guide that they found in the 
Alps for 5,000

3011
02:17:37,431 --> 02:17:41,300
years ago and he's kind of like this 
murder mystery because we have found out

3012
02:17:41,301 --> 02:17:46,301
that he was shot with an arrow.
We found all these scenes about these 

3013
02:17:46,301 --> 02:17:49,001
life and death or some crazy ass details
that archaeology can give us about this 

3014
02:17:49,001 --> 02:17:51,140
guy's life.
What he was doing there,

3015
02:17:51,150 --> 02:17:56,150
savvy dance that he may have been doing 
acupuncture 2000 years before it was 

3016
02:17:56,150 --> 02:17:58,070
ever done in China that were like crazy 
stuff.

3017
02:17:58,140 --> 02:18:00,740
But what was the evidence of him doing 
acupuncture?

3018
02:18:01,070 --> 02:18:01,820
Needles?
No,

3019
02:18:01,821 --> 02:18:04,070
they found like these tattoos,
but they're not that.

3020
02:18:04,071 --> 02:18:09,071
It was like artistic that they are like 
dots and the lines and they roll along 

3021
02:18:09,071 --> 02:18:14,001
the acupuncture points.
They are all alone points where he was 

3022
02:18:14,001 --> 02:18:16,931
in pain,
so they think that he was kind of some 

3023
02:18:16,931 --> 02:18:19,820
form of acupuncture that you would dig 
in that spot with needles and then you 

3024
02:18:19,820 --> 02:18:23,291
would see late with like possibly like 
the way they do mock trial where they 

3025
02:18:23,291 --> 02:18:26,921
burned herb,
some bright spots and the leaves that's 

3026
02:18:26,921 --> 02:18:26,921
probably out of those attitudes 
originated.

3027
02:18:27,610 --> 02:18:32,610
It's creepy.
It's like that rewrites history in so 

3028
02:18:32,610 --> 02:18:35,831
many ways,
like some crazy European 2000 years 

3029
02:18:35,831 --> 02:18:39,281
before acupuncture was in China,
was doing something very similar to 

3030
02:18:39,281 --> 02:18:39,770
Trudet.
Pretty Weird in itself.

3031
02:18:40,180 --> 02:18:42,530
Never mind the whole murder mystery 
aspect of it.

3032
02:18:42,540 --> 02:18:43,710
Also,
I don't know.

3033
02:18:43,711 --> 02:18:48,711
I dig they stories.
There are so many out there in history 

3034
02:18:48,711 --> 02:18:51,251
that I have a field agent speaking one 
and then researching the hell out of it 

3035
02:18:51,251 --> 02:18:51,251
for a couple of moments.

3036
02:18:51,330 --> 02:18:52,800
There's another new one that we're 
saying,

3037
02:18:52,801 --> 02:18:57,801
reef rewrites history.
They've found a mammoth of a dead body 

3038
02:18:57,801 --> 02:19:00,960
of a mammoth that had a clear evidence 
of human predation,

3039
02:19:00,961 --> 02:19:05,961
like one of the ribs had been shattered,
they think with a spear or something 

3040
02:19:05,961 --> 02:19:07,260
like that,
but the problem was it was 45,000

3041
02:19:07,261 --> 02:19:10,170
years old and Siberia and they didn't 
even know that people were their back.

3042
02:19:10,190 --> 02:19:11,820
Right.
So like they got it.

3043
02:19:11,830 --> 02:19:12,960
Okay.
Well,

3044
02:19:13,410 --> 02:19:16,170
I guess we're a little off here with the
time too.

3045
02:19:16,171 --> 02:19:18,020
It's just,
it just keeps going on and on.

3046
02:19:18,021 --> 02:19:23,021
I don't remember.
I don't remember the exact specific 

3047
02:19:23,021 --> 02:19:23,021
details.
The story.

3048
02:19:23,021 --> 02:19:25,170
That's almost the problem with the over 
abundance of stories in the Internet.

3049
02:19:25,171 --> 02:19:26,730
You almost get too many of them.
I know.

3050
02:19:26,910 --> 02:19:31,910
They're just coming at you all day.
I was starting that to Jamie right 

3051
02:19:31,910 --> 02:19:31,910
before we started.
I was like,

3052
02:19:31,910 --> 02:19:32,360
Jesus Christ,
I love Internet,

3053
02:19:32,361 --> 02:19:35,420
but at the same time I need to get out 
there wasting time because it's just too

3054
02:19:35,421 --> 02:19:35,630
much.

3055
02:19:35,630 --> 02:19:37,370
Too much.
There's good stuff.

3056
02:19:37,550 --> 02:19:42,550
Too much.
You could go down or motherfucking 

3057
02:19:42,550 --> 02:19:42,550
rabbit hole.
I went down a penis,

3058
02:19:42,550 --> 02:19:46,670
a penis operation rabbit hole.
The other day somebody sent me a link.

3059
02:19:46,730 --> 02:19:51,730
Matt stags.
Actually sent me a link to some guy who 

3060
02:19:51,730 --> 02:19:51,730
grew back is for skin when I was like,
all right,

3061
02:19:51,730 --> 02:19:56,680
let's see what he did.
So this guy like put like weights and 

3062
02:19:56,680 --> 02:20:00,581
stretched out.
It's for skin and all this different 

3063
02:20:00,581 --> 02:20:02,711
shit.
And so then from that you know like the 

3064
02:20:02,711 --> 02:20:02,711
suggestions over the right hand side on 
youtube.

3065
02:20:02,900 --> 02:20:05,120
One of them was like this penis 
operation.

3066
02:20:05,121 --> 02:20:05,660
I was like,
oh,

3067
02:20:06,430 --> 02:20:11,430
so then I go to this thing and this guy 
is under and this guy they install a 

3068
02:20:11,430 --> 02:20:16,271
pump and his ball sack and so the doctor
with his rubber gloves covered in blood 

3069
02:20:16,271 --> 02:20:18,410
is squeezing on this guy's balls and 
it's turned.

3070
02:20:18,420 --> 02:20:20,360
These guys don't work.
What?

3071
02:20:21,020 --> 02:20:24,050
Like that's what liberace had.
Apparently he had one of them pumps.

3072
02:20:24,980 --> 02:20:29,980
They put a a like a pump.
You're pumping your dick up with fluid.

3073
02:20:31,041 --> 02:20:34,550
I guess it's like a fluid in there and 
then you hit a button and it releases it

3074
02:20:34,760 --> 02:20:38,920
and your Dick goes flacid again.
Fuck and bizarre.

3075
02:20:39,380 --> 02:20:44,380
The head doesn't get hard though.
The head is like sort of like a floppy 

3076
02:20:44,601 --> 02:20:49,601
head.
It didn't seem like I was disappointed 

3077
02:20:49,601 --> 02:20:51,360
because it kind of defeats the purpose.
I was just.

3078
02:20:51,470 --> 02:20:56,470
It was strange numbers.
All these other penis operations that I 

3079
02:20:56,470 --> 02:20:56,470
just.
I couldn't do it.

3080
02:20:56,470 --> 02:20:56,810
I couldn't do it.
Couldn't get into it.

3081
02:20:57,610 --> 02:20:59,540
That's the third editorial.
Yeah.

3082
02:20:59,541 --> 02:21:01,040
You can go deep.
You can go deep.

3083
02:21:01,310 --> 02:21:02,270
All right.
