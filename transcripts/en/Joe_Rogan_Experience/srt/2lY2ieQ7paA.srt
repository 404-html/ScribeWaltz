1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,570
The joe rogan experience,
but we are in the,

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,910
you know,
but also no know shut up.

3
00:00:05,911 --> 00:00:08,010
Right.
But it's also people on both ends.

4
00:00:08,011 --> 00:00:11,730
Like you choosing to get upset about
some really ridiculous Sheree the tweet

5
00:00:11,731 --> 00:00:13,100
and you go to that person's page and you
go,

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,400
I get it.
Read someone's tweet and I go to that

7
00:00:17,401 --> 00:00:19,390
main page.
I could put,

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,270
I could add up right in one minute.
I get it.

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,480
I get where he was coming from.
I understand why he said that.

10
00:00:24,481 --> 00:00:26,460
He's a musician.
He's daddy's a politician.

11
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,700
He sells this,
he likes to to this today somebody hit

12
00:00:29,701 --> 00:00:31,740
me and I ran.
He was a poor riser fan.

13
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,540
I get it.
You're a fucking book.

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,660
You know what I'm saying?
I've never met a Paul Riser Fan of your

15
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,630
Paul Riser fashion.
Shoot yourself in the fucking mouth

16
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:43,060
right now.
Once somebody said,

17
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,130
if I go to some of these pains and I see
like music and I know the music sucks,

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,353
that's where it ends.

19
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,900
Because of his choice of music sucks.
That's what if I don't see you fucking

20
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:54,510
one of my three on there,
like I'm gonna go on to people's that

21
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:57,900
there's two things I judge people don't
judge people by money or nothing.

22
00:00:57,901 --> 00:01:00,640
I just people that music collection.
But I look at your collection.

23
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,670
You don't have sabbath paranoid if you
don't have the staples Zeplin too.

24
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,370
Those are the stable.
If you don't have a Zeppelin to,

25
00:01:08,371 --> 00:01:10,520
why are we here?
Why Not Smoking Dope for you?

26
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,770
Why are you wasting my fucking time?
I'm over here.

27
00:01:13,771 --> 00:01:16,590
You got like Judy granted.
You know what I'm saying?

28
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,610
That and number two,
when you opened up some of these

29
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,100
refrigerators,
there's certain,

30
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,030
yeah,
it's true.

31
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,560
You'll open that tells me everything.
If you're a fucking milk,

32
00:01:23,561 --> 00:01:26,060
if you're a month,
if I see like low and beer,

33
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,500
your fucking money.
I ain't never come in here.

34
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,290
And I did certain people that um,
they have music laying around just

35
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,150
because it's cool.
I'm tons of them.

36
00:01:33,151 --> 00:01:38,151
That's why the generation of people that
want to say,

37
00:01:38,401 --> 00:01:41,610
and I know this and I don't hate you
cause I'm kind of in the same way that

38
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,650
they don't want to like Floyd's they
prefer to listen to.

39
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,910
Oh that's so commercialize.
Yeah.

40
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,670
Into more receipt.
You know,

41
00:01:50,671 --> 00:01:54,480
they make you feel bad.
The worst being that Tom Waits era,

42
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,740
those motherfuckers are ones I want to
punch him right in the fucking face

43
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,830
because they're the ones you're having a
good time listening to something.

44
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,870
You're Bob and they want to like really
impressed,

45
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:06,180
like some fucking dumped chick with
freckles or something.

46
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,180
Everybody's fucked already gone.
You know what I'm saying?

47
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:11,490
Everybody fucked.
All you need is Tequila and a grammar

48
00:02:11,491 --> 00:02:12,900
blown.
She'll be sucking your dick in the

49
00:02:12,901 --> 00:02:13,734
fucking bathroom.

50
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,200
You want to be cool.
And let's the Tom waits heavy winds of

51
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,260
time.
Wait,

52
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,280
that's good singing.
You want that,

53
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:25,950
you're fucking idiot.
But the only reason that people would

54
00:02:25,951 --> 00:02:30,450
put that shit on is to try to overpower
you with that fucking star wars.

55
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:32,730
What do you call that?
The fucking thing with the mind.

56
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,700
The mind.
That's it.

57
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:36,883
Oh,
he's so,

58
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,410
oh my God,
he likes Tom.

59
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,020
Wait,
listen to this and they're trying to let

60
00:02:40,021 --> 00:02:42,030
me sit you down with a gun next to your
head.

61
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,690
You're telling me that's good.
That's good.

62
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,140
That's the Beatles.
Y'All fucking shoot.

63
00:02:49,141 --> 00:02:52,080
You fucking put a gun to your fucking
hat.

64
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:53,910
All right,
telling me that's good music.

65
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,100
You're fucking 20 years old.
Knock it off.

66
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,380
Like when somebody says,
I like the Dave Matthews band.

67
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,050
I will pistol whip you.

68
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,270
I'm the way up here.
But you would access this to me.

69
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,120
That would do an exodus by bucking Bob
Marley.

70
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:14,890
I almost cracked the fucking car.
A white dude with no shoes on and a

71
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:16,510
black new planner.
It fucking,

72
00:03:16,511 --> 00:03:17,860
it's too,
it's true.

73
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:21,640
Made up uncle Joey stop it.
I think he's got some good songs.

74
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,030
They bath.
It's got a few good.

75
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,390
So you got me emotional.
Thank God I've got together.

76
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,810
Fuck this shit.
I was too quiet over there.

77
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:30,940
I hate all that shit.
Just listen.

78
00:03:30,941 --> 00:03:32,410
You don't like it.
Just move over.

79
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,710
I can't stand fucking time.
And the people like Tom Waits,

80
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:38,710
look at them and go to that page and
it'll tell you the whole thing like

81
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:39,940
that.
That something ain't right.

82
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:43,350
That vegans something there,
you know,

83
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,970
stopped the pill.
Could pilgrims they care for something

84
00:03:45,971 --> 00:03:46,840
that you're like,
really?

85
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,270
I was like,
the Tom Waits is a guy who probably has

86
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:51,430
a son that I would like,
but I don't want to go find it.

87
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,400
Oh,
he's probably like one or two songs.

88
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,630
One Song,
pick a fucking song,

89
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,020
pick a song.
And it sounds like he's taking a shit.

90
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:04,060
It sounds like a dude.
What the fuck is this?

91
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:06,640
More on singing and I know people going,
oh my God,

92
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,110
he's a revolution than I know Paul
Mccartney.

93
00:04:09,111 --> 00:04:10,540
He's a bad motherfucker.
Why?

94
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,180
He's alive.
Everybody else was dead.

95
00:04:13,181 --> 00:04:15,340
Paul Mccartney won this war.
It's true.

96
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,760
George Harrison's dead.
Everybody's dead.

97
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:22,210
Michael Jackson's dead.
Paul Mccartney still,

98
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,270
even his wife,
he killed the fucking,

99
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:27,400
blew the Lipton chick.
What did her parents,

100
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:30,240
old fucking Kodak.
She had debt.

101
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,420
Guma.
He moved to,

102
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,970
he didn't know he drove her to get a
fucking sandwich.

103
00:04:33,971 --> 00:04:35,920
He died in the car.
Remember dog?

104
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,050
Nobody fucking,
then he had the one with the missing

105
00:04:38,051 --> 00:04:41,470
leg.
Courtney lives McCarthy one.

106
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,410
This fucking game.
We beat you out one.

107
00:04:44,411 --> 00:04:49,411
Everybody McCartney outlived everybody.
The only one him out in John Ball.

108
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,060
We Mick Jagger,
which you don't even want to fuck with

109
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,240
all those other guys.
Think Mick Jagger said filter

110
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,160
motherfucker.
Dude,

111
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,960
ain't God.
I hate that motherfucker.

112
00:04:56,961 --> 00:04:59,770
Why did they hit you want to just
wrangle Mick Jagger?

113
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,380
Why Mick Jagger's or different dudes?
You know Mick Jagger comes up.

114
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,410
Mick Jagger.
What was his background?

115
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,330
I don't know.
Like look at his background.

116
00:05:07,331 --> 00:05:09,400
His background is like,
he went to like the best business

117
00:05:09,401 --> 00:05:10,870
school.
Did you know that?

118
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:11,651
Really?
Yeah.

119
00:05:11,651 --> 00:05:13,510
In England.
Like he's like a fucking wizard

120
00:05:13,511 --> 00:05:15,940
economist or something.
This story.

121
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,560
Yeah.
He don't do nothing unless you show up

122
00:05:17,561 --> 00:05:20,770
with a big bag book.
I know in Boulder,

123
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,260
like we talked about this in the podcast
one time in boulder,

124
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,930
you know out unconscious,
the seats behind you.

125
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,560
Shallow what?
Mr Jagger,

126
00:05:29,561 --> 00:05:31,800
nobody sells the tickets behind them.
They won't bump.

127
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,170
I'm Mick Jagger,
so those tickets,

128
00:05:35,171 --> 00:05:37,270
so we don't go onstage heard that new
shit.

129
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,890
It's horrible.
It's not that bad.

130
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,950
That new songs.
Not that really.

131
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,070
It's not that bad.
I don't know.

132
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:46,080
I just think that,
let me see what I can find it.

133
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,180
Let's help them.
Let's promote the rolling stones.

134
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,970
How funny is that?
Yeah.

135
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,660
It will help you out.
Rolling Stones.

136
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,460
I know you need this.
You never read the little podcast.

137
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,770
He's got a book.
He's got a book that somebody wrote

138
00:06:00,771 --> 00:06:03,500
about them and they interview somebody.
Who's the chick that saying,

139
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:07,300
you know your soul vain.
Carly Simon.

140
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:10,590
Carly Simon sat next to,
she was awesome at some movie premiere.

141
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,370
Awesome.
Mick Jagger sat next to him.

142
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:12,950
I was like,
Oh,

143
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,690
you got a joint?
No,

144
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:16,550
you got to [inaudible] got a bump of
coke.

145
00:06:16,551 --> 00:06:19,670
No.
How about a blow job jacket just killed.

146
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,660
How do you know if he really
talk?

147
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,700
This guy married his wife and he married
in the country.

148
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,130
We're fucking,
it wasn't even legal to be married.

149
00:06:28,131 --> 00:06:31,160
This guy one step ahead of the game.
All he gives a fuck.

150
00:06:31,161 --> 00:06:33,620
It's getting his dick suck.
