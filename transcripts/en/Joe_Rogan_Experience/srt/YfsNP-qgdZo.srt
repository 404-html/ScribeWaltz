1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:07,460
Hey everybody that sound in the back is 
not me going to the bathroom.

2
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:09,690
That's just pouring coffee.
Folks.

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,050
Don't get crazy.
This episode of the podcast is brought 

4
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:16,020
to you by a new sponsor.
It's called blue apron and blue apron.

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:16,860
Uh,
I just,

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,520
I'm just try this out.
This week they sent it to me.

7
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:25,521
This is what blue apron is.
It's a way to get all the ingredients 

8
00:00:25,521 --> 00:00:28,740
for healthy meals along with recipes 
shipped to your house.

9
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,690
It's pretty interesting.
Um,

10
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:32,310
I was a bit skeptical at first.
It was like,

11
00:00:32,311 --> 00:00:37,311
what,
what exactly they're going to do and 

12
00:00:37,311 --> 00:00:37,311
then they send you this thing.
It's got this sheet,

13
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,840
it's got photographs of what everything 
looks like,

14
00:00:39,841 --> 00:00:44,841
shows you how to cook everything.
All the meals are between 500 and 700 

15
00:00:44,841 --> 00:00:49,311
calories per serving.
A really interesting way to low 

16
00:00:49,311 --> 00:00:51,840
calories,
low for how delicious they are.

17
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,870
It's all healthy,
excellent food and it's all stuff that 

18
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:01,521
you don't have to go to a store,
you don't have to going where they'll 

19
00:01:01,521 --> 00:01:04,950
ship everything to you.
It's all like in these coolers that have

20
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:09,951
like,
I guess it's freeze dried or something 

21
00:01:09,951 --> 00:01:09,951
like not freeze dried.
What's that stuff called?

22
00:01:09,951 --> 00:01:11,040
Dry Eyes.
Dry Eyes to keep it cold,

23
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,120
but it,
uh,

24
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,330
it sat inside my house for like 10 hours
and it was still nice and cold when I 

25
00:01:17,401 --> 00:01:18,710
opened it up and put it in the 
frigerator.

26
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,660
Um,
they have all kinds of yummy stuff.

27
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,880
They have the step by step instructions 
were said,

28
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,430
which picture with pictures,
totally idiot proof.

29
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:31,610
They work around your schedule and your 
dietary preferences and the cooking 

30
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:34,881
takes about a half an hour.
Shipping is completely free and you can 

31
00:01:34,881 --> 00:01:37,770
make meals like short rib burgers on 
Pretzel Buns,

32
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,370
Kung Pao chicken tacos,
very delicious stuff.

33
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,400
You Cook incredible meals and you can be
blown away by the quality and the 

34
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:46,440
freshness.
Blue Apron,

35
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:51,441
it's fast,
it's fresh and it's affordable to end 

36
00:01:51,441 --> 00:01:53,490
the stress of cooking.

39
00:02:00,171 --> 00:02:05,171

I've never heard anything like this 

40
00:02:05,171 --> 00:02:06,570
before and like I said,
I was kind of like a bit skeptical,

41
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,780
but the meals are delicious.
Last night I had had some,

42
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,990
I forgot the name of the Tacos,
but it was a steak Taco,

43
00:02:15,991 --> 00:02:19,110
but they all the spices they give you 
like onions,

44
00:02:19,111 --> 00:02:24,111
garlic,
all these different things that chop up 

45
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:24,111
was really kinda cool.
Uh,

46

Go there and get your first two meals 
free.

52
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:46,680
We're also brought to you by ting and if
you go to Rogan.ting.com,

53
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,040
you can get in on what is going to be 
the future of cell phone purchasing and 

54
00:02:52,591 --> 00:02:55,930
cell phone use in my opinion with Ting 
does is they,

55
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:00,610
they rent the sprint backbone so it's 
just like having sprint phone except you

56
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:03,310
have no contracts.
You have no early termination fees,

57
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:04,810
no add ons,
no bs,

58
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:08,500
no weird hidden payments that you have 
to do to deal with.

59
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,390
Most of the time when you buy a cell 
phone,

60
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,990
if you buy a cell phone and the cell 
phone says it costs $200,

61
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:19,230
it's not really $200,
most likely it's probably quite a bit 

62
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:22,771
more,
but what they do is they defer that 

63
00:03:22,771 --> 00:03:22,771
money over the course of the term of 
your contract,

64
00:03:22,771 --> 00:03:25,210
so the phone might really cost $600 
bucks.

65
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,970
So for the next three years that you're 
under contract,

66
00:03:27,971 --> 00:03:30,670
you're slowly paying off that phone.
You don't realize that.

67
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:33,280
So when you go to try to cancel your 
contract,

68
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,590
you owe them a bunch of money and it's 
kind of annoying.

69
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,640
It's also annoying the way they have it 
set up at most cell phone companies.

70
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,310
Accepting this is the only one I know of
that does it differently.

71
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:46,090
Ting has it setup where you only pay for
what you use.

72
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:50,350
Like say if you have like 120 minutes a 
month plan,

73
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,180
most of the time you're not going to use
all that.

74
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,580
And what happens when you don't use it?
Nothing.

75
00:03:54,581 --> 00:03:56,950
You don't get any money back.
If you use more,

76
00:03:56,951 --> 00:03:59,170
you pay more,
they get you a fee.

77
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,780
But if you use less,
you do not get paid.

78
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:06,850
You don't get that money back with Ting,
you only pay for what you use.

79
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:12,090
It's an awesome company.
I really love doing business with them 

80
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:12,090
because first of all,
they're completely,

81
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,980
totally ethical there.
They're also very generous.

82
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:18,340
When Tim had its two year anniversary 
for no reason whatsoever,

83
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:23,050
other than the fact that they wanted to,
they decided to cut rates on slash rates

84
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:25,330
on their data,
which really affected heavy users.

85
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:30,331
Especially 98 percent of people would 
save money with Tim and that is because 

86
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:33,820
they do mobile differently.
Go to [inaudible] dot ting.com

87
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
for more details.
They have all the new and greatest 

88
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,330
android phones available,
including the iphone five.

89
00:04:40,331 --> 00:04:43,000
You can get the iphone five for 260 
bucks.

90
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,910
That's ridiculous folks.
It's cheap.

91
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,350
It's easy.
It's awesome.

92
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,200
And they have been a sponsor of the 
podcast for a long time.

93
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:52,930
So if you were in the market for a new 
cell phone,

94
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,350
please give them a try.
They support us and we support them.

95
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:01,530
Rogan.ting.com.
Go there and save 25 bucks off of a new 

96
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,130
cell phone then.
That's it for now.

97
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,280
But let's just get cracking.
We got a lot of interesting stuff to 

98
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:08,280
talk about.
Ladies and gentlemen,

99
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:13,230
we have a very special guest.
Cue The music Camp Jamie and I'll 

100
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:13,230
introduce him to the world,

101
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,510
the Joe Rogan experience

102
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,720
Joe Rogan podcast.
We have.

103
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:30,780
Is it okay to call you the Godfather?
Please do the godfather here.

104
00:05:30,781 --> 00:05:35,781
Ladies and gentlemen,
and this is in reference to a music 

105
00:05:35,781 --> 00:05:38,310
video that you were a part of.
God.

106
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,970
How do I say your last name?
Sat.

107
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:40,960
Just sat.
That's fine.

108
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,110
Cad side.
It's two a's.

109
00:05:43,111 --> 00:05:48,111
It gets tricky when this next phase 
because it's a guttural sound from 

110
00:05:48,111 --> 00:05:48,111
Arabic.
Oh,

111
00:05:48,111 --> 00:05:49,050
how will you say it?
Side side.

112
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,750
But since most westerners couldn't 
pronounce that,

113
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,610
you just do the AA.
Oh,

114
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,190
that's got to be annoying.
That's where this.

115
00:05:56,191 --> 00:05:57,860
We're like,
we gentrify everything.

116
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,370
We push everything down.
And uh,

117
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:05,980
you are,
you are an expert in evolutionary 

118
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:09,581
psychology and in this is where rick,
it's really fascinating evolutionary 

119
00:06:09,581 --> 00:06:12,530
psychology and its effect on 
consumerism,

120
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:18,010
right?
So I basically apply a evolutionary 

121
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:18,500
psychology on this time that are 
consumed with Tori nature.

122
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:22,490
What are the biological forces that can 
pedal us to be the consumers that we are

123
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,970
defined consumption very broadly.
It's not just consuming Coca Cola,

124
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,460
but we consume friendships,
we consume religion,

125
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:32,060
we consume marriages.
So it's a consumption with a capital c.

126
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:35,020
that's fascinating to me because you 
know,

127
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:38,730
we have these general definitions that 
we use in,

128
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:39,830
in,
in culture.

129
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,760
And one of them is consumerism.
Consumerism almost always pertains to 

130
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,870
buying things,
but what you're looking at it.

131
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,760
And as I like that better because it is 
kind of what we do.

132
00:06:51,761 --> 00:06:54,020
We do consume relationships.
Don't want exactly.

133
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,000
I mean we consume cultural products,
right?

134
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:59,900
So why is it that certain songs are so 
appealing to us?

135
00:06:59,901 --> 00:07:00,290
I mean,
what,

136
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:03,500
what are,
what is it about song lyrics that are,

137
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,880
that trigger an emotional pull us why 
our movies appealing?

138
00:07:07,881 --> 00:07:12,881
Well,
you study these sculptural products 

139
00:07:12,881 --> 00:07:14,981
because they say something really about 
the evolution of the human mind that's 

140
00:07:14,981 --> 00:07:18,820
do you study songs that are annoying as 
well because I've always wondered why 

141
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,270
some songs are like super appealing to 
some,

142
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,880
but then just infuriating to other 
people.

143
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,000
So that would probably be a musicologist
who would study the,

144
00:07:26,001 --> 00:07:29,480
the musical structure of songs to know 
what makes them appealing or not.

145
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:33,050
I'm specifically looking at the lyrics.
So for example,

146
00:07:33,051 --> 00:07:38,051
if you look at hip hop videos,
they're wonderful Darwinian laboratory 

147
00:07:38,051 --> 00:07:42,221
because all the political correctness is
cut out and basically your real 

148
00:07:42,221 --> 00:07:43,550
Darwinian being shines through,
right?

149
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,280
So men are going to signal,
Hey,

150
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:48,020
I've got the Missouri Audi,
I've got the Porsche,

151
00:07:48,021 --> 00:07:49,190
get with me.
Uh,

152
00:07:49,191 --> 00:07:50,830
women are going to signal,
you know,

153
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,430
beauty markers.
It's only women,

154
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:57,431
for example,
who denigrate men if they have low 

155
00:07:57,431 --> 00:07:57,431
social status,
right?

156
00:07:57,431 --> 00:07:58,040
It's never going to be a guy saying,
Hey Linda,

157
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:01,430
you,
you don't work hard enough so you're not

158
00:08:01,431 --> 00:08:03,380
ambitious enough.
I'm not going to have sex with you.

159
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,230
But the other way around you see a 
million songs like that,

160
00:08:06,231 --> 00:08:07,220
right?
Yeah,

161
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:08,420
yeah.
All you know,

162
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,090
like she,
she's not a gold digger,

163
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:15,020
but yeah,
that's very interesting.

164
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,690
I'm a musicologist.
Is that a real person?

165
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,520
A real person?
Yes.

166
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:22,360
That's a musicologist would study lyrics
and dope and.

167
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:27,550
Well they would probably study that.
The structure structure of the musical 

168
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:27,550
notes.
Right?

169
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:27,920
So what,
for example,

170
00:08:27,921 --> 00:08:32,921
what is it?
That's what types of notes are innately 

171
00:08:32,921 --> 00:08:32,921
appealing to people.

172
00:08:32,921 --> 00:08:33,440
Uh,
so that,

173
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,920
that's certainly not what I do.
I'm,

174
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:39,620
I'm looking only at song lyrics as one 
of many types of cultural products.

175
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,950
The lyrics would be the thing that would
be annoying to most though.

176
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:48,410
I mean that would be the thing that 
would really try them out as being 

177
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:48,410
annoying.
Like some inane,

178
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:49,460
retarded songs.
They love Taylor swift.

179
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,170
What you said it,
not me.

180
00:08:51,171 --> 00:08:54,700
How dare you,
how dare you suffered?

181
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,440
I know one thing,
if you date Terrell's swift,

182
00:08:58,441 --> 00:09:03,441
you're a fucking idiot because that shit
will write songs about you for the end 

183
00:09:03,441 --> 00:09:04,680
of time.
She's got whole books about John Mayer.

184
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,870
Is that his name?
Aaron Meyer.

185
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:09,110
I always say it wrong.
John Mayer chicks copy books on that.

186
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:12,080
So that's unfair.
Imagine that.

187
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,700
Um,
so your,

188
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:18,810
your thing would be more along the lines
of studying,

189
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:22,260
like why people are,
why they find it appealing,

190
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:27,261
like the rap type song,
why they find it appealing like Taylor 

191
00:09:27,261 --> 00:09:27,261
swift,
the contents of those songs,

192
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:32,130
if you take a,
a ancient Greek poem,

193
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:32,760
right?

194
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,210
We still studied at university today,
3000 years later,

195
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:41,540
precisely because that poem is going to 
speak to certain realities,

196
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,680
sibling rivalry,
status,

197
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:46,240
competition,
parental conflicts with,

198
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:50,460
with their offspring,
a paternal uncertainty.

199
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,120
All of these factors as what makes 
literature interesting.

200
00:09:54,121 --> 00:09:59,121
So we could study those ancient Greek 
poems today and still address updates 

201
00:09:59,121 --> 00:10:03,090
with us precisely because they are 
speaking about some universal truths.

202
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,780
That is amazing,
isn't it?

203
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,800
That stuff from 3,300
plus years ago is still studied on a 

204
00:10:10,051 --> 00:10:15,051
daily basis,
but some books from like 50 years ago 

205
00:10:15,051 --> 00:10:15,051
gone.
Yeah.

206
00:10:15,051 --> 00:10:16,590
That's got to be frustrating as hell.
If you're a writer,

207
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:18,390
if you're an author and you're just 
like,

208
00:10:18,391 --> 00:10:21,630
what?
That guy is so overrated.

209
00:10:21,631 --> 00:10:24,630
I'm so tired of Ealing hearing about,
you know,

210
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,730
aristotle,
aristotle,

211
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,140
go fuck yourself,
bro.

212
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:33,380
That shit was so long ago.
You didn't know anything or they knew a 

213
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:33,380
lot.
They didn't know a lot of.

214
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,340
Certainly knew the mysteries of human 
nature.

215
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:40,640
I'm fascinated by that.
I am absolutely fascinated by what was 

216
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,511
going on thousands and thousands of 
years ago and like what was the mindset 

217
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:49,011
and communication with those people and 
you can kind of pull a little bit of it 

218
00:10:49,011 --> 00:10:49,620
out of the writing,
but man,

219
00:10:49,621 --> 00:10:54,621
if I could go back in time to some.
I mean it would have to be a culture 

220
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:55,980
obviously that speaks English where it 
could understand what they're saying,

221
00:10:55,981 --> 00:10:59,730
but I think that would be incredibly 
fascinating to go back three or 4,000

222
00:10:59,731 --> 00:11:04,731
years ago and communicate with people.
Just try to figure out how they see the 

223
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:04,731
world.
Absolutely.

224
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:09,470
You know,
a lot of people are very stuck on 

225
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:09,470
identifying cultural differences.
Right?

226
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:13,820
So the French eat this type of food,
the Malaysians do this type of dance 

227
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:17,690
and.
But what they miss is that underneath 

228
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,821
all of these important cross cultural 
differences is this bedrock of human 

229
00:11:19,821 --> 00:11:22,620
universals that make us a lot more 
similar than different from one another.

230
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:28,220
And especially in the social sciences 
where people are really focused on just 

231
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,520
identifying differences,
differences,

232
00:11:29,521 --> 00:11:31,890
differences,
but of course there are also things that

233
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:33,720
are so common so that,
for example,

234
00:11:33,721 --> 00:11:36,240
beauty markets,
there are certain beauty markers that if

235
00:11:36,241 --> 00:11:39,240
I went to the Yanomami tribe in the 
Amazon,

236
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,940
they're going to find exactly the same 
things,

237
00:11:41,941 --> 00:11:45,930
attractive and the beautiful girls in 
rap videos as you and I would.

238
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:50,580
And that's because those beauty markers 
are evolutionary markers and so yes,

239
00:11:50,581 --> 00:11:55,581
culture matters.
Nobody denies the fact that the culture 

240
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:58,110
important,
but underneath these cultural 

241
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:58,270
differences is a biological,
biological heritage that makes you and I

242
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,340
are very similar to one another.
What,

243
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:03,790
what changes over time that makes beauty
markers differently?

244
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:08,830
Like I've always been fascinated,
but like if you look at the renaissance 

245
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:08,830
paintings,
the women were very.

246
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:13,020
You wouldn't,
you can't even call them voluptuous 

247
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:13,020
there.

248
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:13,330
They're overweight.
Ruben Ruben asked like they eat a lot of

249
00:12:13,331 --> 00:12:15,820
Ruben's.
What is she even asked me?

250
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:20,880
Well,
it's rubin was a painter who was 

251
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,371
particularly had a pension for drawing 
these voluptuous women who was a fatty 

252
00:12:23,371 --> 00:12:25,290
chaser.
It was a bit of a fatty chase.

253
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:30,291
Ruined that.
I must say this is the first time that 

254
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:30,790
I've held an interview where fatty 
chaser has come up,

255
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:31,750
so thank you.
Well,

256
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:35,000
you need to be involved in more 
podcasting because fatty taste.

257
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,200
It's important to say now that you're 
fat shaming,

258
00:12:38,201 --> 00:12:43,201
that's the newest thing.
Do you follow these ultra super 

259
00:12:43,201 --> 00:12:46,030
sensitive terms and their evolution?
You said we've got up to three hours.

260
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,920
I could talk about this for about 30 
hours.

261
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:52,960
Poly.
I actually went recently to a and we 

262
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:52,960
come back.
We'll come back to the rubin,

263
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,040
so we'll come back to that.
I recently gave a talk at Wellesley 

264
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,830
College,
all women's college women's college data

265
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,590
chicken went there.

266
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,650
Is that right?
Times are rough.

267
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,050
Tough time.
It.

268
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,640
Taylor swift.
No,

269
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:09,850
it was a gal who did not shave her legs 
because it was patriarchal to beautify 

270
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:10,840
yourself there.
Yeah,

271
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,310
she can pull it off.
She was blonde,

272
00:13:12,311 --> 00:13:14,560
but whoa.
Her roommate was a Hobbit,

273
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,820
showed hairy feet old thing,
but hey,

274
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:18,820
you know,
whatever.

275
00:13:18,821 --> 00:13:20,410
It's just cultural norms.
That's it.

276
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:25,440
So anyways,
I give a talk there under this thing 

277
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,760
called the freedom project,
which tries to promote sort of iconic,

278
00:13:27,761 --> 00:13:32,761
classic ideas that kind of break the 
shackles of political correctness and 

279
00:13:32,761 --> 00:13:36,951
uh,
it was just amazing that kind of stuff 

280
00:13:36,951 --> 00:13:39,121
that was happening there.
I mean I'll just give you one or two 

281
00:13:39,121 --> 00:13:39,121
examples.
A,

282
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:44,610
apparently it was a form of oppression 
to assume for a professor to assume that

283
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:51,250
when he meets students he right away 
categorizes them as either being male or

284
00:13:51,251 --> 00:13:52,480
female.
So for example,

285
00:13:52,481 --> 00:13:55,690
if I see you in my class and I say,
Hey sir,

286
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:01,860
while the law,
well that would be a form of oppression 

287
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,531
because I'm assuming based on your outer
markers that you are male rather than 

288
00:14:04,531 --> 00:14:08,881
what I should do is sort of do a quick 
polling of each person in terms of how 

289
00:14:10,571 --> 00:14:11,770
they'd like to be addressed.

290
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,530
So you may be biologically male but you 
are a gender,

291
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,260
whatever,
transgender,

292
00:14:17,261 --> 00:14:18,730
you'd be queer,
it can be queer,

293
00:14:18,731 --> 00:14:20,080
you can be this.
So as you know,

294
00:14:20,081 --> 00:14:23,480
facebook has 50 markers,
the 50,

295
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,610
there's 55,
zero,

296
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,300
zero.
I could only,

297
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,240
I could 10,
right?

298
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,450
Wow.
Fifty 50.

299
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,940
And for folks who don't know,
queer is not a slur.

300
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,320
When I'm saying Queer,
I'm like,

301
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:37,630
Hey,
I'm not saying it like that.

302
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:42,810
Queer is,
they do not want to be interpreted as 

303
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:45,730
male or female.
They want to be just whatever they are.

304
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,760
Right?
And so now you have at universities of 

305
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,180
discussion as to whether you should have
not male and female bathrooms,

306
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,700
but you should have gender neutral 
bathrooms.

307
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,410
Uh,
and so on and so forth.

308
00:14:57,411 --> 00:15:00,730
And so on.
Academia and the world that I reside in,

309
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,440
it's,
it's,

310
00:15:01,441 --> 00:15:03,500
it's there.
Why is it getting so squirrely?

311
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:04,130
What's going on?

312
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,200
Are we too soft?
Do we have to hunt for our own food?

313
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:11,300
Do we have to deal with the winter more?
Do we have to like chop wood to keep 

314
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:15,671
warm?
What is making us concentrate on these 

315
00:15:15,671 --> 00:15:18,401
frivolous matters of like,
it's not just a politically correct 

316
00:15:18,401 --> 00:15:22,331
thing,
it's like it's coddling the most 

317
00:15:22,331 --> 00:15:24,740
ridiculously over-sensitive notions that
human beings have ever constructed.

318
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:29,890
I think we've been parameterized by an 
astonishing farm of political 

319
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:30,700
correctness.
I mean what [inaudible] like,

320
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,020
like a parasite that.
Oh,

321
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:37,220
right.
So in the same way that I like that 

322
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:37,980
word,
that viruses can enter your body,

323
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:43,410
a virus,
he's of the mind can also take over 

324
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:43,410
your,
your.

325
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,980
I mean religion is an example of a Mima 
plex form of.

326
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,170
I mean some people would be upset by 
what I'm saying,

327
00:15:48,171 --> 00:15:51,200
but a form of parasite that kind of 
rewires your thinking.

328
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:56,700
So political correctness is a,
an astonishing form of parasitic 

329
00:15:57,171 --> 00:16:02,171
thinking where everything is viewed 
through the lens of I should not offend 

330
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:07,151
anyone and so common sense and just 
reason goes out the window and the 

331
00:16:07,151 --> 00:16:08,090
pursuit of non offense.

332
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,190
You know what though I have an issue 
with it,

333
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,700
that most people who practice this in 
the extreme form,

334
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,020
they say that they should not offend,
but you know who they offend,

335
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:23,050
they offend anyone who does not agree 
with their notion that you should not 

336
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:26,441
offend.
They will be violent and angry and 

337
00:16:26,441 --> 00:16:29,291
fucking incredibly insulting to people 
who do not agree with their,

338
00:16:29,661 --> 00:16:34,661
their,
their terms of what is a fence and 

339
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:35,440
what's not offensive.
I have been some of the Ma,

340
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:40,540
meanest,
nastiest things had been said to me by 

341
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,271
people who claim to be a in this sort of
ultra sensitive super open minded 

342
00:16:44,751 --> 00:16:49,751
category,
which is quite fascinating to me that 

343
00:16:49,751 --> 00:16:49,880
you're exactly right.
I'll give you a fantastic quote.

344
00:16:49,881 --> 00:16:51,020
I might be paraphrasing.
It's like that.

345
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:56,030
I think it's Thomas Soul A.
I'm an economist who basically was 

346
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:58,370
criticizing so-called diversity,
so.

347
00:16:58,371 --> 00:17:03,371
Right,
so at American universities or in 

348
00:17:03,371 --> 00:17:03,371
western universities,
everybody talks about diversity,

349
00:17:03,371 --> 00:17:07,961
but the only form of diversity that's 
not allowed is intellectual and 

350
00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:07,961
political diversity.

351
00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:08,750
Right?
So,

352
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:13,810
so you want.
We want diversity in terms of skin 

353
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,941
color.
We wanted diversity in terms of sexual 

354
00:17:15,941 --> 00:17:15,941
orientation.
We want diversity in terms of genders.

355
00:17:15,941 --> 00:17:17,630
Right?
So all forms of diversity are welcome,

356
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:23,050
but don't you dare step out of line with
the accepted politically correct 

357
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,590
positions.
Now that's diversity that we don't want.

358
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,210
Yeah.
What is that?

359
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:26,990
What?
I mean,

360
00:17:26,991 --> 00:17:28,970
how do they not see that thought?
Police?

361
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,010
Yeah,
and I face it.

362
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,140
I mean eventually I guess we'll come 
back to my work.

363
00:17:33,141 --> 00:17:35,650
I face it very much in my work because 
I,

364
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:40,660
I,
I rile up all sorts of different people 

365
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:40,660
out of the woods,
the woodwork.

366
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:44,681
So for example,
radical feminists hate my work because 

367
00:17:44,681 --> 00:17:44,930
how dare you say that we are biological 
beings?

368
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,940
How dare you say that there are sex 
differences.

369
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:51,240
A postmodernist will hate my work 
because the truth is all relative.

370
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,100
There's no such thing as scientific 
truth.

371
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,640
It's all relative.
Uh,

372
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:58,410
the religious folks will hate my work 
because if Darwinian theory is correct,

373
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:03,420
it is a then where is God in all this?
So there's this long queue of people who

374
00:18:03,421 --> 00:18:05,270
will come out of the woodworks to 
criticize you.

375
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,930
Not for any valid scientific reasons,
but because they,

376
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,870
it,
it shakes their ideological beliefs.

377
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:15,280
It's fascinating to me the parallels 
between religious nutters and 

378
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,250
politically correct nutters because it's
very similar in a lot of ways that their

379
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:21,990
ideology is just so cemented in their 
consciousness.

380
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,290
More bile.
It's rock solid.

381
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,330
It's not going anywhere.
If you disagree,

382
00:18:27,331 --> 00:18:30,440
you patriarchal piece of shit,
you know,

383
00:18:30,441 --> 00:18:34,260
male fucking suppressor,
you horrible thing.

384
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:37,090
It's,
it's quite fascinating if,

385
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,390
if,
if there aren't,

386
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,140
not,
if they're not differences,

387
00:18:40,141 --> 00:18:45,141
any differences in the sexist,
what do they use these radical 

388
00:18:45,141 --> 00:18:48,411
feminists,
what do they use to define the reason 

389
00:18:48,411 --> 00:18:49,370
why humans have such varying behavior 
between the male and female gender?

390
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,770
Are you ready for this?
Everything.

391
00:18:52,771 --> 00:18:55,920
Short of genitalia is a social 
construction,

392
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,200
right?
So even for example,

393
00:18:58,201 --> 00:19:03,201
the fact that Baba grew up to be a,
a block center for the University of 

394
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:11,270
Oklahoma,
and hence he could bench press 500 

395
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:11,270
pounds.
That's not due to,

396
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:14,990
for example,
any physiological reasons that he is so 

397
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:17,421
strong.
It's because what happened is his 

398
00:19:17,421 --> 00:19:17,421
parents,
uh,

399
00:19:17,421 --> 00:19:20,640
aggressively nurtured rough tumble play.
Whereas for girls,

400
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:26,030
they told them,
listen to them that you should not be 

401
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:28,311
playing so rough and that then either 
gives the green light or the red light 

402
00:19:28,311 --> 00:19:29,910
to express your physicality.
That's insane.

403
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:33,350
That's absolutely insane that that idea 
is insane.

404
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:38,430
That there's not a difference in the 
physiological properties of the bodies 

405
00:19:38,551 --> 00:19:43,551
of men and women.
I mean the biological differences are 

406
00:19:43,551 --> 00:19:43,920
scientific.
While they are there.

407
00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:45,270
There are some feminists and I,
again,

408
00:19:45,271 --> 00:19:50,271
I'm paraphrasing the quote,
they'll say there's no such thing as a 

409
00:19:50,271 --> 00:19:53,691
male or female brain as there is no such
thing as a male or female pancreas or 

410
00:19:53,691 --> 00:19:53,691
liver.

411
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:54,750
Right?
So,

412
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:59,520
so the Oregon that defines your 
personhood is actually gender neutral.

413
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:04,730
Now,
that is astonishing because we are a 

414
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,501
sexually reproducing species,
so one of the foundational tenants on 

415
00:20:06,501 --> 00:20:10,521
which biological understanding happens 
is that we have two types of 

416
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,590
polymorphisms.
If you'd like to type,

417
00:20:13,591 --> 00:20:16,200
we have a male and a female so that we 
could sexually reproduce.

418
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:19,680
So the idea that much of this as social 
reconstruction,

419
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,840
this social construction is just 
laughable.

420
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,510
I think it comes though,
I mean just to be fair to them,

421
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:29,430
I think it originally comes from a 
desire to fight sex,

422
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:34,490
institutionalized sexism,
but what happens is that they mix 

423
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:37,200
equality under the law as being 
indistinguishable beings,

424
00:20:37,201 --> 00:20:42,201
right?
We we could be different beings yet we 

425
00:20:42,201 --> 00:20:44,130
should be equal under the law,
but they argued that if you admit to the

426
00:20:44,131 --> 00:20:48,370
fact that we are different than that 
makes it easier for the status

427
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:49,210
quo,
sexist,

428
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:53,620
patriarchy to maintain it's privileged 
position and so they create this edifice

429
00:20:53,621 --> 00:20:58,621
of the past 50 to 100 years of social 
science research that is completely 

430
00:20:58,721 --> 00:21:03,721
laughable,
but that they hang onto like religious 

431
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:03,721
beliefs.

432
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:07,200
It's so fascinating.
There was a woman that has a video 

433
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,951
online on youtube where she claimed that
there is no difference in the physical 

434
00:21:09,951 --> 00:21:14,181
strength of men and women and it's just 
that men have been encouraged to engage 

435
00:21:14,181 --> 00:21:16,260
in weightlifting and all these different
things that women did the same thing.

436
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:19,230
They'd be just as strong.
That is insane.

437
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:24,740
It's so insane.
Have 10 times more testosterone than 

438
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:24,740
women.
Is that a social construction?

439
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:29,510
Well,
it's also insane because women who are 

440
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:32,271
athletes,
women who are elite world class 

441
00:21:32,271 --> 00:21:35,511
athletes,
if they compare their hand strength to 

442
00:21:35,511 --> 00:21:35,970
men who don't even exercise,
men are stronger.

443
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,000
Just the ability to grab things and grip
things.

444
00:21:39,001 --> 00:21:44,001
Right.
There was an issue where there was a 

445
00:21:44,001 --> 00:21:46,311
woman who is a transgender,
she became a transgender woman and she 

446
00:21:46,311 --> 00:21:50,421
used to be a man.
She was a man for 30 years and then she 

447
00:21:50,421 --> 00:21:50,421
didn't tell anybody,
start fighting women and women's mma and

448
00:21:50,421 --> 00:21:51,120
I was furious.

449
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,120
I went crazy about it and I got so much 
hate from people that were calling me 

450
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,410
transphobic because you're transforming 
and I'm like,

451
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:00,120
that's amazing.
Like you don't understand.

452
00:22:00,121 --> 00:22:03,360
There's a difference in the male frame.
There's a difference in the shape of the

453
00:22:03,361 --> 00:22:04,680
hips,
the dye,

454
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,450
the mechanics of the short,
like everything.

455
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:09,030
The whole body is built different and 
not only that,

456
00:22:09,031 --> 00:22:13,260
the fact that it takes 30 years,
like you're 30 years of being a man with

457
00:22:13,261 --> 00:22:18,261
full testosterone and then it takes like
10 years before your bone density even 

458
00:22:18,261 --> 00:22:22,761
starts decreasing,
but they wanted to make it so it's 

459
00:22:22,761 --> 00:22:25,551
completely indistinguishable and they 
also have support from transgender 

460
00:22:25,551 --> 00:22:30,231
surgeons,
which is quite fascinating and 

461
00:22:30,231 --> 00:22:32,661
completely biased.
These transgender surgeons who want to 

462
00:22:32,661 --> 00:22:36,021
or reassignment doctors and they want to
pretend that their exact equals 

463
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,380
physiologically.
I got.

464
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:43,570
Sorry on that.
So in my first book I talk about John 

465
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:47,500
Money,
who was a very famous psychologist at 

466
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,291
Johns Hopkins,
really around maybe the fifties to 

467
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:53,531
seventies.
He was a big gender theorists who 

468
00:22:53,531 --> 00:22:56,291
basically argued that everything is due 
to socialization so that when surgeons 

469
00:22:56,291 --> 00:23:00,470
would go see him because they had to do 
gender reassignment either,

470
00:23:00,471 --> 00:23:02,600
for example,
let's say at a circumcision,

471
00:23:02,601 --> 00:23:07,601
you in the rare case where you botch the
circumcision and now you have a problem 

472
00:23:07,601 --> 00:23:10,010
in terms of having a functioning penis 
or if you have,

473
00:23:10,011 --> 00:23:11,150
for example,
a condition,

474
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:15,110
a micro penis where you're unlikely to 
be a functioning mail when you grow up,

475
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:18,320
while he would say don't worry about it,
just have the surgery,

476
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:23,500
put a dress on the kid and raised him as
a girl and they'd be absolutely no 

477
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,730
problem.
And of course the reality is that that's

478
00:23:25,731 --> 00:23:29,180
not how biological sex is determined.
And the most famous cases,

479
00:23:29,181 --> 00:23:34,181
David Reimer,
who was one of his patients who after 

480
00:23:34,181 --> 00:23:34,181
having gone through the treatment,
committed suicide.

481
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,390
Yeah,
I remember that case.

482
00:23:35,391 --> 00:23:38,380
So it was a fascinating story.
The,

483
00:23:38,381 --> 00:23:40,060
um,
the reality of,

484
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:45,270
of what you said,
one of the more fascinating aspects of 

485
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:49,111
it is the difference between us all 
being equal as human beings and being 

486
00:23:49,111 --> 00:23:52,040
the same because we are not,
we're not equal,

487
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:55,370
we are very different,
but we all should be equal as far as our

488
00:23:55,371 --> 00:23:56,270
rights.
Right.

489
00:23:56,510 --> 00:24:01,510
You know,
as far as how we're treated by each 

490
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,480
other and the law and what a person can 
get away with.

491
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:03,320
You know,
what,

492
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:06,290
what keeps our society civil and kind.
Yeah.

493
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:11,291
Those,
that we should all have equality 

494
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:11,291
including children and old people and 
everyone.

495
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:12,860
Everyone should have equality in that,
in that aspect.

496
00:24:12,861 --> 00:24:15,950
That's what,
what makes a civilized caring society,

497
00:24:15,951 --> 00:24:20,951
but the idea that there's no differences
as far as the other thing that we are 

498
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,400
equal as far as like physical strength 
or as equal as far as like our wants and

499
00:24:25,401 --> 00:24:26,600
desires and needs.

500
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,960
That's,
that's denying hundreds of years of 

501
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,540
literature of the struggle,
the struggle in all cultures between the

502
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:40,100
male trying to understand the female,
the female trying to understand the male

503
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:45,130
were completely alien to each other.
We exist amongst each other when we 

504
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:46,730
gather information over a long period of
time,

505
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:52,030
but then we say ridiculous things like 
here's one of the things that people 

506
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:52,030
love to say,
happy wife,

507
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:52,900
happy life,
right?

508
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:58,150
Why is that?
Because make her happy and she'll stop 

509
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:58,150
screaming at you.
Don't understand her.

510
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,690
Just make her happy,
do whatever she wants,

511
00:24:59,691 --> 00:25:02,390
and then she'll calm down and you'll be 
good.

512
00:25:02,391 --> 00:25:04,370
But believe me,
you can't just be yourself.

513
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:09,610
You can't just be what you want to be 
and do what you want to do because 

514
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:13,690
that's going to drive her fucking crazy 
because you want to have sex with 100 

515
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:14,060
women who want to drive 50,000
miles an hour.

516
00:25:14,061 --> 00:25:16,130
You want to disappear for weeks at a 
time.

517
00:25:16,131 --> 00:25:16,150
I

518
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:18,450
thought by the Patriarchy you had been 
given the.

519
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,370
I've been brainwashed,
brainwashed by the,

520
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,580
by the way,
speaking of sexual variety,

521
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,310
which is kind of a central issue in 
evolutionary psychology.

522
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:30,660
Uh,
you should see some of the hate mail I 

523
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:30,660
get when I state something has been out.
As you know,

524
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:35,441
men would have evolved a greater pension
for sexual variety for terribly trivial 

525
00:25:35,441 --> 00:25:36,110
reasons.
To explain,

526
00:25:36,111 --> 00:25:38,840
right?
I mean women have a think called greater

527
00:25:38,841 --> 00:25:39,980
parental investment,
right?

528
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:43,730
Women on average have from from there,
when the he start to,

529
00:25:43,731 --> 00:25:46,910
when they have menopause,
400 x 400 x,

530
00:25:46,911 --> 00:25:51,911
so it's a scarce resource.
Men and one ejaculation have 250 

531
00:25:52,221 --> 00:25:57,221
spermatozoa,
so our gametes are very cheap and 

532
00:25:57,221 --> 00:26:01,961
abundant,
and then of course you add the cost of 

533
00:26:01,961 --> 00:26:01,961
gestation,
right?

534
00:26:01,961 --> 00:26:05,000
But the likelihood of having mortality 
when you were giving birth.

535
00:26:05,001 --> 00:26:08,990
So for all these reasons,
women have much greater minimal parental

536
00:26:08,991 --> 00:26:09,800
obligations.

537
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:15,040
Therefore evolutionary theory would 
predict that they would be much more 

538
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,810
judicious when they're making a choice 
because if they make a poor mate choice,

539
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,600
that looms much larger for them.
That on the other hand,

540
00:26:20,601 --> 00:26:25,601
for men,
the costs of making a poor mate choice 

541
00:26:25,601 --> 00:26:28,510
are not as great,
but the benefits of having multiple 

542
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:31,151
meeting opportunities are quite 
beneficial and therefore that's why on 

543
00:26:31,151 --> 00:26:34,340
average you expect men to have a much 
greater pension for sexual variety.

544
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:39,550
Now that's been documented in 17 
trillion different ways and yet you 

545
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,810
still have people that will send you 
hate mail saying,

546
00:26:41,811 --> 00:26:42,410
Mike,
God,

547
00:26:42,411 --> 00:26:44,640
are you a pig?
How could you promulgate

548
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:49,910
this garbage will you?
I think when you're looking at human 

549
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:52,410
beings and you're talking about these,
these variables,

550
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:55,860
you're looking at it as objectively and 
scientifically as possible.

551
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:01,160
When people want that concrete world 
that we've discussed this political 

552
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:04,110
correct concrete world politically 
correct,

553
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:09,320
they have this resistance to looking at 
it in any way other than the way that 

554
00:27:10,021 --> 00:27:15,021
they have.
It's completely non scientific and 

555
00:27:15,021 --> 00:27:15,021
that's why it's religious,
right?

556
00:27:15,021 --> 00:27:19,610
Absolutely,
and that's actually one of the 

557
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:19,610
criticisms that you often get about 
evolutionary psychology.

558
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:21,690
People think that you are trying to 
justify behaviors.

559
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:26,870
For example,
if you explain why people are likely to 

560
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:27,000
cheat and they're on their monogamous 
unions,

561
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:27,900
then they say,
oh,

562
00:27:27,901 --> 00:27:32,901
well you're.
You're offering father to why people 

563
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:32,901
should do it out.
Of course,

564
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:36,180
my rebuttal is I'm.
I'm certainly doing no such thing.

565
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:38,970
Similar to how an oncologist studies 
cancer.

566
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,530
He's not justifying counselor.

567
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:42,610
He's not for cancer.
He's right.

568
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:47,630
He,
he just explains he or she explains 

569
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:48,780
cancer and so I don't have a moral 
position,

570
00:27:48,781 --> 00:27:51,510
right?
I don't come to the table when I'm doing

571
00:27:51,511 --> 00:27:54,030
my scientific research hoping for one 
thing or another.

572
00:27:54,031 --> 00:27:56,160
The data speaks for itself,
but again,

573
00:27:56,161 --> 00:28:01,161
the ideologues will say no,
but if this forbidden knowledge gets 

574
00:28:01,161 --> 00:28:04,050
out,
it makes it easier for people to justify

575
00:28:04,051 --> 00:28:09,051
this behavior or that behavior.
It's absolutely fascinating to me how 

576
00:28:09,051 --> 00:28:13,191
human beings react and act and so this 
subject is quite near and dear to my 

577
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,550
heart.
I love it.

578
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,990
I just,
I'm.

579
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:21,190
I'm fascinated by the cast of it all.
I love watching people flail and scream 

580
00:28:21,511 --> 00:28:24,600
and get angry about whether it's 
religious anger,

581
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,270
like people who are like legitimately 
Christian,

582
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:30,640
like I love the God hates fags people,
the Westboro baptist.

583
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,880
I don't love them.
I love everybody.

584
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,650
In one way I would like everybody to be 
nice,

585
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:39,830
but I love the fact that they exist 
because I'm absolutely fascinated by 

586
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:42,951
their folly.
I'm absolutely fascinated by this idea 

587
00:28:42,951 --> 00:28:45,390
that they have in their head that's so 
concrete that they believe that soldiers

588
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:48,300
are dying because men are being allowed 
to marry other men.

589
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:53,840
It's unbelievably weird,
but compelling to me and in,

590
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,190
in,
in an equal way.

591
00:28:56,370 --> 00:29:01,370
The idea that you saying that there is 
some sort of an invested commitment that

592
00:29:01,831 --> 00:29:06,831
a woman has an a man does not have 
objectively just looking at us as a 

593
00:29:06,831 --> 00:29:10,140
biological reproducing species that you 
had experienced hate because of that.

594
00:29:10,141 --> 00:29:11,910
As a scientist,
as a person,

595
00:29:11,911 --> 00:29:15,120
just analyzing data.
I'm amazed and I'm fascinated.

596
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,490
I'm just drawn into it.
I can't help myself.

597
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:19,410
You want to talk about some religious 
stuff?

598
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:20,520
Sure.
Uh,

599
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,020
well,
uh,

600
00:29:22,021 --> 00:29:24,240
you know,
I was born in Lebanon,

601
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,890
uh,
were Lebanese Jews.

602
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,240
Uh,
although I'm,

603
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,270
I'm a non believing Jewish guy.
How dare you.

604
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:32,400
I know,
I know you believe in some things.

605
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,810
Tell you what I believe it's science and
truth and uh,

606
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:39,570
and so we escaped Lebanon actually 
during the civil war.

607
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:42,460
My parents in 80 were kidnapped

608
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,910
by father,
the very peaceful because,

609
00:29:44,911 --> 00:29:45,760
you know,
it's all peaceful.

610
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:47,860
Uh,
and uh,

611
00:29:47,861 --> 00:29:52,861
and then after that we,
we've never gone back to Lebanon and so 

612
00:29:52,861 --> 00:29:53,110
I,
from a very young age,

613
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,760
I think I already had sort of the innate
pension to question religious belief,

614
00:29:57,761 --> 00:30:02,761
which certainly created fiction within 
my family because you should just 

615
00:30:02,761 --> 00:30:02,860
believe in shut up,
right.

616
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:05,200
But then when I saw the,
the,

617
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:09,160
the hatred that religion in genders 
firsthand,

618
00:30:09,161 --> 00:30:14,161
right?
I mean facing execution as we were 

619
00:30:14,161 --> 00:30:14,560
trying to escape Lebanon and then coming
to the west,

620
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:18,550
I think I became that much more forceful
in my convictions to,

621
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:19,330
to,
to,

622
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:24,470
to try to combat religious dogma and of 
course some of the biggest hate mail 

623
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:29,161
that you get this when you do that.
And I've even had real professional 

624
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:34,320
situations where I've,
I've lost professionally because of my 

625
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:34,320
position is actually here in California.

626
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:37,780
I've had several schools who otherwise 
were very,

627
00:30:37,781 --> 00:30:42,781
very interested in making me very,
very lucrative offers who after maybe 

628
00:30:42,781 --> 00:30:47,011
doing a bit of due diligence on me and 
seeing that I'd written stuff that was 

629
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,520
critical of religion.
Suddenly I became persona non grata.

630
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:50,320
Really?
Really?

631
00:30:50,321 --> 00:30:55,321
That's fascinating.
I wouldn't think that there'll will be 

632
00:30:55,321 --> 00:30:57,001
the case as far as they are.
They're even schools in southern 

633
00:30:57,001 --> 00:31:00,511
California that won't,
and they do this legally because they 

634
00:31:00,511 --> 00:31:02,920
are religiously founded institution.
If you're not the seventh,

635
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:06,900
seventh day adventists,
we can grant you tenure it.

636
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:11,970
There's another school that had a god 
squad whereby you go up in front of the 

637
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:11,970
Gospel.
I mean,

638
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,560
that's literally their term where,
uh,

639
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:18,220
you have to sort of show that you're 
accepting Jesus in your heart.

640
00:31:18,221 --> 00:31:20,740
And I remember when I school,
that's a school college,

641
00:31:20,741 --> 00:31:22,090
very,
very prominent school.

642
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,130
Please.
Then it though.

643
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:28,720
Can you write it rhymes with Layola 
Marymount?

644
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:29,560
No,
it's not,

645
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,920
but it's within that general area.
Uh,

646
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:35,200
there's another school three years ago 
who was going to make me a huge,

647
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:40,290
huge offer in Orange County that didn't 
work out now to the person who wanted me

648
00:31:40,931 --> 00:31:43,450
to appear in front of the God squad.
This was several years ago when I was at

649
00:31:43,451 --> 00:31:44,950
UC Irvine.
I told him,

650
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:48,790
you do realize that I am a atheist.
Lebanese Jew.

651
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,350
Evolution is so it's going to be.
It's going to be a while before I accept

652
00:31:53,351 --> 00:31:58,351
Jesus in my heart and it his answer was,
well,

653
00:31:58,961 --> 00:31:59,710
no,
but don't worry.

654
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:01,180
We'll,
we'll coach you as to,

655
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:03,040
as to what to say.
Oh,

656
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:06,790
so that's a euphemism for lying,
right?

657
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:09,320
How's that fit with the whole real?
So you know,

658
00:32:09,321 --> 00:32:13,840
this is right here in 21st century,
southern California in academia,

659
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:18,920
you know,
you better hold certain religious 

660
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:18,920
beliefs,
otherwise we'll punish you.

661
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:18,920
Jew.
Boy,

662
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:23,250
that's amazing.
And that's some colleges and then or 

663
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,850
some universities and the universities 
to complete opposite.

664
00:32:24,851 --> 00:32:29,851
If you're not an atheist,
I'm sure that you'd take a lot of slash 

665
00:32:29,851 --> 00:32:33,250
true at other universities or in 
academia in general,

666
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:38,330
it is quite a progressive to criticize 
certainly Christianity,

667
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,900
right?
Because you're seen as a progressive guy

668
00:32:41,901 --> 00:32:43,670
who doesn't buy into all this brunch 
aid,

669
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:46,260
superstitions,
but there is one religion that

670
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:49,120
Islam,
she Islamophobia.

671
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,270
Isn't that fascinating?
I love that.

672
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:58,271
This is same ultra progressives that 
would give you a million different ways 

673
00:32:58,271 --> 00:33:03,221
to address someone based on whatever 
gender they identify with or you know,

674
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,590
whatever the fuck else.
Weird ultra super sensitive thing.

675
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:09,830
I find that completely fascinating.
This Islamophobia thing you find,

676
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:14,120
there's several websites that I frequent
just to freak myself out,

677
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,400
and uh,
the,

678
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:18,080
the super sensitive ones on a regular 
basis,

679
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:20,550
we'll go over this Islamophobia.
Well,

680
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:20,810
because

681
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,540
it's,
it's,

682
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:21,820
uh,
it's,

683
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:26,730
it's actually a very astute way to,
to have intellectual warfare.

684
00:33:26,731 --> 00:33:31,731
You're actually saying that people who 
are concerned about particular aspects 

685
00:33:31,731 --> 00:33:34,050
of this ideology are crazy,
right?

686
00:33:34,051 --> 00:33:39,051
They suffer from a phobia,
so you are denigrating them at their 

687
00:33:39,051 --> 00:33:41,370
core.
You must be nuts to actually fear this.

688
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:45,180
And actually the term started as you may
or may not know,

689
00:33:45,181 --> 00:33:50,181
it started with the Muslim Brotherhood,
a very smart strategy where they knew 

690
00:33:50,251 --> 00:33:53,550
that the west is very open to being 
tolerant and so on.

691
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:58,730
And so they kind of piggybacked on that.
And so in academia you just never 

692
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:00,630
criticized that one I got.
Now that's very dangerous because in a,

693
00:34:00,631 --> 00:34:04,710
in a sane world,
all beliefs should be open to criticism.

694
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,460
Absolutely.
And not only that,

695
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:10,630
how about the one that is responsible 
for most of the suicide bombing?

696
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,660
Some of phobic.
I am Islamophobia.

697
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,610
Set it.
I'm Islamophobia,

698
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:17,080
Juha phobic.
I'm Catholic,

699
00:34:17,081 --> 00:34:21,340
a phobic Christian of phobic.
I'm afraid of all of your reason.

700
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:24,130
Fillic you love the reason that I do.
Well,

701
00:34:24,131 --> 00:34:26,350
I,
I was raised a Catholic for a very short

702
00:34:26,351 --> 00:34:28,720
amount of time and uh,
I got very lucky.

703
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:33,640
I had a very tumultuous childhood and 
when I was in first grade my parents put

704
00:34:33,641 --> 00:34:38,641
me in Catholic school and up until then 
I was obviously don't remember much of 

705
00:34:38,921 --> 00:34:43,921
this because it was,
but I was very religious and it was 

706
00:34:43,921 --> 00:34:46,831
because my parents were divorcing and 
there was a lot of violence in the 

707
00:34:46,831 --> 00:34:50,821
household and I have this idea in my 
head that somehow or another God was the

708
00:34:51,341 --> 00:34:52,930
right way and everybody else was wrong.

709
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:56,230
Going to Catholic school cured me of 
that entirely.

710
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,020
The nun that I had,
sister Mary Josephine,

711
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:02,560
I don't remember much about being six 
years old,

712
00:35:02,561 --> 00:35:04,980
but I remember that bitch.
She,

713
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,880
she was very important to me.
She,

714
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:11,940
she really straightened me out because I
realized that she has no connection 

715
00:35:11,981 --> 00:35:16,981
whatsoever to anything holy or majestic.
She represented and she,

716
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:22,480
she showed all of the horrors of 
humanity.

717
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,430
Meanness,
evilness,

718
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:29,280
being nasty to children,
fearmongering and this,

719
00:35:29,281 --> 00:35:32,170
this is ailia killed everything.
All the above.

720
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,730
It was just,
it was nothing,

721
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:38,880
nothing holy about it.
It was pretty obvious pretty quickly 

722
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,740
that it was all bullshit.
So I was cured from one year of Catholic

723
00:35:40,741 --> 00:35:45,741
school.
I told my parents was gonna run away 

724
00:35:45,741 --> 00:35:45,741
from home if they tried to put me in 
second grade.

725
00:35:45,741 --> 00:35:45,741
Wow.
Yeah.

726
00:35:45,741 --> 00:35:45,990
I was like,
I'm done.

727
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,630
Like you don't understand what it's 
like.

728
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:49,020
I went from,
you know,

729
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:51,210
being around my mother was this great 
person,

730
00:35:51,211 --> 00:35:54,210
sweet my grandparents,
or great to all of a sudden,

731
00:35:54,211 --> 00:35:55,380
you know,
I didn't go to kindergarten.

732
00:35:55,381 --> 00:36:00,381
I just went to first grade.
It was my first year in school to being 

733
00:36:00,381 --> 00:36:03,141
round these monsters and this monster 
school that was just filled with 

734
00:36:03,141 --> 00:36:07,340
darkness.
It was like the whole school was just 

735
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:07,340
dark.
All the priests,

736
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,340
the,
I remember their faces,

737
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:11,700
they all had these gin blossoms all over
their faces from drinking,

738
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:17,030
you know,
and the nuns were all overweight and 

739
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:20,150
bitter and angry and they're fucking 
skin was having a bad relationship with 

740
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,810
their face.
It was like hanging off of them.

741
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,610
Everything about them was just 
monstrous.

742
00:36:23,611 --> 00:36:28,611
That evilness.
I'm keeping accounts that have the 

743
00:36:28,611 --> 00:36:28,920
amount of hate mail that's to 
comfortable with come bitches.

744
00:36:28,921 --> 00:36:31,230
Let it come.
I'll just send it right back to you.

745
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,780
I don't get it.
I don't get it.

746
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,000
You know I.
I'm fascinated by it,

747
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:41,030
but I understand that people need that.
They have this desire to believe in 

748
00:36:41,431 --> 00:36:43,230
things.
I understand that,

749
00:36:43,231 --> 00:36:46,110
but I don't understand how you can be a 
rational,

750
00:36:46,111 --> 00:36:51,111
intelligent,
objective person who looks at some shit 

751
00:36:51,111 --> 00:36:51,210
that people wrote thousands of years ago
and say,

752
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,140
no,
this is.

753
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:55,720
This is immobile.
This is exactly it's.

754
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:59,180
You cannot alter it.
This is what it is and this is.

755
00:36:59,181 --> 00:37:01,500
This is written in stone.
This is.

756
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,660
There's no way around this.
This is God's word.

757
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,400
Anybody questions that as a full.

758
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,760
I do,
and in my one of my latest books,

759
00:37:08,761 --> 00:37:13,761
I have a chapter which I think got me in
trouble with one of the southern 

760
00:37:13,761 --> 00:37:15,300
California schools that I was getting 
enough from it because I've given them a

761
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,720
signed copy of that book and then they 
probably got to that chapter.

762
00:37:18,721 --> 00:37:21,750
It's called that chapter's called 
marketing hope by selling lies.

763
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:27,200
And so what I do in that chapter,
as I go through different hope Adler's 

764
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,330
of which religion is the greatest,
but others will be medical quackery,

765
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,800
self help,
gurus and so on.

766
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:35,910
So,
so different agents that peddle hope,

767
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:38,840
and I argue again from an evolutionary 
perspective because they,

768
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:42,320
they're very successful because they 
cater to these very basil,

769
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,400
Darwinian insecurities.
None greater than the very obvious one 

770
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,080
of existential angst,
right?

771
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:51,600
We're the only animal that we're aware 
of that actually is aware that we are on

772
00:37:51,601 --> 00:37:52,560
a death sentence,
right?

773
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,050
I mean,
I know that I've got another thing,

774
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:56,190
luckily maybe 40 years,
right?

775
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:57,960
Well,
if I have high cholesterol,

776
00:37:57,961 --> 00:38:00,050
I go to my physician,
he gives me lipitor,

777
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:01,440
boom,
ldl goes down,

778
00:38:01,441 --> 00:38:02,990
everybody's happy,
but how?

779
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:07,410
What pill do I take to solve this really
looming problem that's at the end of the

780
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:09,120
road called my death?
Well,

781
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:11,940
different religions will give you 
different dances,

782
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,270
but they all certainly promise you some 
form of eternity.

783
00:38:15,271 --> 00:38:16,890
It could be in the form of 
reincarnation,

784
00:38:16,891 --> 00:38:18,120
it could be,
I'll be with Jesus.

785
00:38:18,121 --> 00:38:22,230
It could be a divergence,
but there are all sorts of ways by which

786
00:38:22,231 --> 00:38:27,231
I could secure my attorney and I think 
for most people it's very difficult to 

787
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:34,010
not drink that kool aid.
I think it takes almost a pathological 

788
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,040
and dysfunctional to

789
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,480
say,
I'm not going to buy that.

790
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:42,540
I realize that I've got 80 years and I'm
going to really do the best that I can 

791
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:46,291
drink those 80 years.
I think it's a lot more comforting to 

792
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:46,291
say,
no,

793
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:47,770
this part is going to go on forever.
It certainly more comforting.

794
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,150
It's also there's something about human 
beings where we realized somewhere along

795
00:38:52,151 --> 00:38:57,151
the line that it's.
There's no one alive that has any more 

796
00:38:57,151 --> 00:39:01,981
answers about what lies beyond the great
beyond after death.

797
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,820
What lies beyond the yawning grave.
No one has any answers.

798
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,710
You can't give you what the answer is.
Nothing.

799
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:12,340
Nothing you would hope so are you would 
think that you have that answer,

800
00:39:12,341 --> 00:39:13,930
but have you ever done psychedelic 
drugs?

801
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:19,180
Haven't.
There you go so you don't answer so 

802
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,670
quickly.
When I tell you there are two ways of of

803
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:25,510
seeking to reach and mortality at one of
course is it might seem a bit crass,

804
00:39:25,511 --> 00:39:27,640
but through just the genetic 
propagation,

805
00:39:27,641 --> 00:39:32,641
your,
your children are in a sense your form 

806
00:39:32,641 --> 00:39:32,641
of that.

807
00:39:32,641 --> 00:39:32,730
I don't buy that.
You don't like that one?

808
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:35,410
It's not immortal because the earth 
doesn't last.

809
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:40,650
I mean,
unless someone figures out how to get 

810
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:42,541
off the planet,
we only have what one point 9 billion 

811
00:39:42,541 --> 00:39:42,541
years.
I'm like,

812
00:39:42,541 --> 00:39:46,670
yeah,
I mean we don't have enough time for 

813
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:46,670
anything.
There's no way.

814
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:50,460
There's no in mortality unless there's 
some sort of a fractal nature to the 

815
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:54,391
universe where it's life and death is 
just completely ongoing cycle where the 

816
00:39:54,391 --> 00:39:57,520
deeper you go it starts again and yeah.
I don't know about that.

817
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:00,100
I don't know about that either,
but it is possible.

818
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:06,090
The universe itself is so bizarre and 
unexpected and the more you look into 

819
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:07,540
the universe,
like I remember when I was a kid,

820
00:40:07,541 --> 00:40:12,541
I used to think space.
I used to think of space like a 

821
00:40:12,541 --> 00:40:12,640
neighborhood.
I really did.

822
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:16,630
I,
I remember very succinctly that,

823
00:40:16,631 --> 00:40:21,631
uh,
I would like look at like buck rogers 

824
00:40:21,631 --> 00:40:21,631
and all these different space,
like,

825
00:40:21,631 --> 00:40:25,130
oh,
they're going to go over to this town 

826
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:25,130
and they're going to come back and this 
is our neighborhood.

827
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:25,930
They're going to go to that neighborhood
and come back.

828
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:31,350
And then as I got older and I started 
studying astronomy and I started 

829
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:35,760
studying the.
And as I got older also the knowledge 

830
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,810
that they had about the amount of stars 
changed and they started talking about 

831
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:43,960
how there's more stars in our galaxy 
than there are grains of sand on all the

832
00:40:43,961 --> 00:40:45,320
beaches and all,
you know,

833
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:48,670
all the beaches on earth.
And then I remember just thinking like,

834
00:40:48,671 --> 00:40:53,671
well,
this is a motherfucker of a 

835
00:40:53,671 --> 00:40:54,931
neighborhood.
Like this is starting to get really 

836
00:40:54,931 --> 00:40:54,931
strange.
All right?

837
00:40:54,931 --> 00:40:57,040
And then as you get older,
still you realize that they,

838
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,920
there's no way they know how big it all 
is.

839
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:03,880
They have a general sense of 14 plus 
billion light years.

840
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:07,090
But then there's the fractal nature of 
black holes.

841
00:41:07,091 --> 00:41:12,091
The possibility that inside every galaxy
is a black hole that contains an 

842
00:41:12,091 --> 00:41:16,141
entirely new universe.
And this is something that's being 

843
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:16,141
thrown about by,
not by freaks,

844
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:18,580
but by like real serious,
legitimate scientists.

845
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,000
So that alone is so bizarre.
The idea that you live and die seems 

846
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,350
very trivial.
They come back again or reincarnation 

847
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:28,530
mean why not?
If a,

848
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:30,590
if a supernova can exist,
no,

849
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:33,890
why is it so crazy that a person lives 
for and just

850
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:36,080
continues to reincarnate?
Well,

851
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:38,150
and in light of all that vast vastness 
that you said,

852
00:41:38,151 --> 00:41:40,640
isn't it incredible that all of the 
monotheistic,

853
00:41:40,641 --> 00:41:45,641
Abrahamic religions would argue that on 
some small speck of sand in some bronze 

854
00:41:46,401 --> 00:41:49,760
age point,
God spoke to some profit and told them,

855
00:41:49,761 --> 00:41:54,761
you really better not eat pig know.
So in this great unit universe,

856
00:41:56,010 --> 00:42:01,010
ca know this cosmos,
it's really important that you don't 

857
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:04,301
wear leather,
leather shoes that young people or 

858
00:42:04,301 --> 00:42:06,671
whatever.
It's just astonishing to me that people 

859
00:42:06,671 --> 00:42:07,160
actually buy this stuff.
Well,

860
00:42:07,161 --> 00:42:09,410
I think that the reason for the pig 
stuff,

861
00:42:09,411 --> 00:42:10,140
and there's,
there's,

862
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:11,000
there's,
I've,

863
00:42:11,001 --> 00:42:13,700
I've talked about this recently with my 
friend already who,

864
00:42:13,701 --> 00:42:18,701
uh,
was raised very religious Judaism and 

865
00:42:18,701 --> 00:42:20,500
then as he got older just decided to 
abandon it all.

866
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:22,580
Now he's at dirty comedian,
hilarious,

867
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:27,940
but um,
we were talking about that the pork 

868
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:27,940
thing was probably due to diseases.

869
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:30,870
I talk about that in my analysis,
so I,

870
00:42:30,871 --> 00:42:33,770
I don't,
I don't do the analysis for a pork,

871
00:42:33,771 --> 00:42:38,570
I do it for shellfish and so if you look
at shelf red tide and things along those

872
00:42:38,571 --> 00:42:41,960
lines so you can't tell which one is 
infected,

873
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:44,810
you can't look at the water and,
and,

874
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:49,430
and predict which one would likely have 
the bacteria.

875
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:54,820
And so all you know is that once in a 
while somebody would eat it and drop 

876
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:58,971
that.
Since you don't have any ability during 

877
00:42:58,971 --> 00:43:02,261
the bronze age to refrigerate and so on,
well you don't have any access to the 

878
00:43:02,261 --> 00:43:07,091
germ theory.
Certainly they didn't know anything 

879
00:43:07,091 --> 00:43:08,951
about that.
Well then it must be some mild 

880
00:43:08,951 --> 00:43:10,841
addiction.
And so you're exactly right that there 

881
00:43:10,841 --> 00:43:10,841
are very,
very clear,

882
00:43:10,841 --> 00:43:12,830
obvious biological explanations for most
of these food taboos.

883
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:18,190
Yeah.
It's just ridiculous that in 2014 Peter 

884
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:18,190
People don't realize the origins of 
these.

885
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:23,140
Like yes,
it was a great idea 2000 years ago 

886
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:25,751
before we understood thermometers that 
you you have to cook your meat to 150 

887
00:43:25,751 --> 00:43:28,070
degrees that kills the bacteria and then
it's perfectly,

888
00:43:28,071 --> 00:43:32,150
totally healthy,
but if you try to eat pork the same way,

889
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:37,151
you will try to eat venison,
you're going to get really sick and 

890
00:43:37,151 --> 00:43:37,160
that's why religions like,
hey look,

891
00:43:37,161 --> 00:43:39,740
if we want to keep our people alive,
we've got to tell them not to eat.

892
00:43:39,741 --> 00:43:42,980
This particular animal is an animal that
eats a lot of stupid shit.

893
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:45,250
Exactly.
Yeah,

894
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:50,650
so religion has been the biggest blow 
back of your work or actually probably 

895
00:43:53,241 --> 00:43:58,241
the ones that are,
that were the most acerbic and their 

896
00:43:58,241 --> 00:44:00,740
criticisms have been other social 
scientists even more.

897
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:05,800
Yeah,
because the social sciences have very 

898
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:09,281
much developed over the past hundred 
years with a complete rejection of 

899
00:44:09,281 --> 00:44:10,340
biology.
How is that a science then?

900
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:14,020
They called social sciences.
You rejected biology,

901
00:44:14,021 --> 00:44:16,880
which is measurable and Social Sciences 
sort of.

902
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:21,910
Well,
what they argue is that what makes us 

903
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:24,641
human is that we transcend our biology,
so don't use the evolutionary mechanisms

904
00:44:24,951 --> 00:44:29,951
that explain the behavior of the Zebra 
and the dog and the mosquito to explain 

905
00:44:29,951 --> 00:44:31,980
our behaviors.
What makes us it human is

906
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:35,130
precisely that we're able to transcend 
these biological imperatives.

907
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:36,510
And so,
uh,

908
00:44:36,511 --> 00:44:38,930
the field of anthropology,
not anthropology,

909
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,640
which is a subset of anthropology that 
recognizes biology,

910
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:44,430
but for example,
cultural anthropology is all about going

911
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:48,900
to all of these exotic cultures and 
demonstrating how each culture is unique

912
00:44:48,901 --> 00:44:53,901
and different.
And hence there are no such thing as 

913
00:44:53,901 --> 00:44:55,941
human universals.
A social psychology is pretty much 

914
00:44:55,941 --> 00:44:56,310
operated without any understanding of 
biology.

915
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:01,640
So what I did in my work as I came along
and I founded this field which I coined 

916
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:06,411
evolutionary consumption,
where I apply evolutionary theory in 

917
00:45:06,411 --> 00:45:07,290
biology to study consumer behavior,
but more generally my,

918
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:11,390
my real goal is to what I call maybe 
it's a grand goal to Darwin eyes,

919
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,460
the business school.
The idea is that you can study anything.

920
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:19,461
You can't study invest investment 
psychology or personnel psychology or 

921
00:45:19,461 --> 00:45:22,890
organizational behavior or consumer 
behavior without recognizing that all of

922
00:45:22,891 --> 00:45:25,380
these players are biological beings,
right?

923
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:30,650
The decision that you make if your blood
sugar is low and you're hungry is very 

924
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:31,890
different than decision you make if 
you're satiated,

925
00:45:31,891 --> 00:45:32,220
right?
I mean,

926
00:45:32,221 --> 00:45:34,260
that's a trivial example,
but a very obvious one.

927
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:39,710
So the idea that economists have spent 
100 years developing all these fanciful 

928
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:44,540
mathematical models without ever 
recognizing that there are these 

929
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:48,711
biological forces that compel us to be 
the decision makers that we are is 

930
00:45:48,711 --> 00:45:53,420
astounding to me.
So the greatest blow back has been from 

931
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:56,271
social scientists who typically have 
been very reticent to accept what this 

932
00:45:57,481 --> 00:46:00,180
biology boys saying about consumer 
behavior and so on.

933
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,580
Fascinating.
Not the good news.

934
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:07,990
Can I kind of go on please?
I always use a quote by a guy called the

935
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:14,480
JBS Haldane,
who was a very evolutionary geneticist 

936
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:14,520
who was very quotable,
very had all these great clips.

937
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:19,910
So he said that there are four stages 
that scientists go through before they 

938
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:22,020
accept the theory.
And I'll start paraphrasing.

939
00:46:22,021 --> 00:46:24,030
So Stage one,
this is bullshit.

940
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,510
This is garbage stage two,
well this might be true,

941
00:46:27,511 --> 00:46:30,400
but it's rather perverse stage three.
Well,

942
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:31,680
this,
this is true,

943
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:35,460
but largely unimportant and stage four 
or I always set so

944
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:39,110
the reason why that quote

945
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:41,700
captures,
I mean if I ever did an autobiography of

946
00:46:41,701 --> 00:46:42,760
my scientific career,
I.

947
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:48,080
That quote is basically my book because 
I've seen people go through these four 

948
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:51,810
stages in their responses to my work.
At first I couldn't get an invitation to

949
00:46:51,811 --> 00:46:55,750
go to to get 20 minutes at a,
at a conference to speak because what?

950
00:46:55,751 --> 00:47:00,751
What does biology you have to do with 
anything and now of course sciences and 

951
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:04,640
author corrective process.
The evidence is coming in my way and I 

952
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:04,640
don't mean to gloat about it.
Yeah.

953
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:10,930
Now they're all coming fast and furious.
You're the man and I remember 10 years 

954
00:47:11,681 --> 00:47:14,410
ago I've still kept your email where you
said I was a bullshitter.

955
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:15,940
No,
that wasn't me.

956
00:47:15,941 --> 00:47:18,810
That must have been my research 
assistant who hacked my email.

957
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:25,420
How Dane is a great guy to quote.
He had a fantastic quote that I love.

958
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:30,450
Not only is the universe queer than we 
suppose it's queer than we can it that 

959
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:30,450
you

960
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:31,000
know what,
you're my.

961
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:33,670
You're my new coolest guy to to actually
know who,

962
00:47:33,671 --> 00:47:35,820
how Dane is your event.
Well,

963
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:38,210
it's a special quote.
That's just an amazing.

964
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,370
I'm the Beatles.
I don't know the exact.

965
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:41,290
Do you know this one?
No,

966
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:44,200
I think there are something like,
I hope I'm not getting it wrong,

967
00:47:44,201 --> 00:47:49,201
but maybe 300,000
species of beetles and so in his quote,

968
00:47:49,421 --> 00:47:50,250
he basically says,
you know,

969
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:55,380
if God exists,
he must have a particular penchant for 

970
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:59,431
beetles for having spent so much effort 
and coming up with all of these 

971
00:47:59,431 --> 00:48:00,940
different species variations.
Yeah,

972
00:48:00,941 --> 00:48:01,690
no kidding.
Right.

973
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:06,870
What,
what is it frustrating being a man who 

974
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:10,591
is an intellectual who is trying to go 
over the variables and try to figure it 

975
00:48:13,571 --> 00:48:18,571
all out and piece it together.
Is it frustrating to you to see these 

976
00:48:18,571 --> 00:48:22,860
obvious biases and this is obvious,
muddy thinking that enters into this,

977
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,210
this sort of debate.

978
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:29,800
It is on two levels,
on sort of the intrinsic level.

979
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:32,110
I'm a dog,
a pursuer of the truth,

980
00:48:32,111 --> 00:48:37,111
and so I almost get offended by these 
positions and so in that sense it's 

981
00:48:37,111 --> 00:48:37,590
frustrating,
but there's also an extra,

982
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:40,870
like a real sort of tangible way that 
it's frustrating.

983
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:46,110
A lot of these gatekeepers are the ones 
who decide whether I get a position in 

984
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:49,360
southern California not.
And so if I play within the paradigm,

985
00:48:49,361 --> 00:48:51,820
if I do the research that is expected of
me,

986
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:56,980
that doesn't sort of bust any existing 
theories that I'm good,

987
00:48:57,070 --> 00:49:00,640
but if I'm this guy from the outside 
who's trying to biologies the field,

988
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:01,200
well,
who,

989
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:03,730
who does this guy think he is?
So in that sense,

990
00:49:03,731 --> 00:49:06,430
I think it's also frustrating and I,
my wife always tells me,

991
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:07,330
well,
don't worry.

992
00:49:07,331 --> 00:49:09,060
I mean if you can keep this,
sorry,

993
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:14,080
it's,
it makes a big difference how you can 

994
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:14,080
move it around.

995
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:14,080
Sorry,
I don't mean to interrupt.

996
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,760
So your wife tells you something.
My wife tells me,

997
00:49:15,761 --> 00:49:16,660
you know,
I mean,

998
00:49:16,661 --> 00:49:17,790
don't worry,
you know,

999
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:19,810
you'll get all your vindication.
I said,

1000
00:49:19,811 --> 00:49:24,811
well,
I don't want to get vindicated when I'm 

1001
00:49:24,811 --> 00:49:24,811
dead.
The postmortems I want.

1002
00:49:24,850 --> 00:49:26,260
I want the rewards now.
And not,

1003
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:31,320
not in a narcissistic way,
but because there are also perks to 

1004
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,890
people finding out that hopefully you 
are correct.

1005
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:38,280
Now the reality is that more and more 
people are coming around and so if I 

1006
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,930
look at the level of hostility that I 
faced 10 years ago versus today,

1007
00:49:40,931 --> 00:49:45,931
it's night and day.
What was the first major backlash that 

1008
00:49:45,931 --> 00:49:50,611
you experienced?
What social scientists not being A.

1009
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:53,620
I mean having my papers desk rejected by
editors.

1010
00:49:53,621 --> 00:49:55,330
So that's great.
Are you familiar with that?

1011
00:49:55,410 --> 00:50:00,410
To explain it for people.
So that means basically when you send 

1012
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:03,511
your paper to a scientific journal,
usually the editor will look at your 

1013
00:50:03,511 --> 00:50:03,520
paper and say,
okay,

1014
00:50:03,521 --> 00:50:08,521
well here are three reviewers that I 
think would be appropriate for this 

1015
00:50:08,521 --> 00:50:08,521
paper.

1016
00:50:08,521 --> 00:50:13,500
And then he sends it off and then the 
process starts and it goes back and 

1017
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:16,381
forth for probably several,
several years when he desk rejects says 

1018
00:50:16,381 --> 00:50:20,410
he's basically saying that this paper is
not worthy of even going out for review.

1019
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:22,080
And so,
you know,

1020
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:27,160
I would send all of these papers to 
these top journals and the editor would 

1021
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:27,380
write back to me.
Sorry,

1022
00:50:27,381 --> 00:50:29,210
I'm not even sending it through the 
review process,

1023
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:31,940
what do you remember what one of the 
original ones was?

1024
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:34,770
Was the subject of A.
Well,

1025
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:39,790
the probably the first one was one where
I was introducing the theoretical 

1026
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:44,111
framework of how to apply evolutionary 
psychology and understanding marketing 

1027
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:48,790
and usually the the,
the argument that I would receive it,

1028
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:53,850
which which is breathtakingly inane and 
it's stupidity as well.

1029
00:50:55,101 --> 00:50:58,280
Evolutionary theory is just a bunch of 
just so storytelling,

1030
00:50:58,630 --> 00:51:03,630
right?
You just come up with these fanciful 

1031
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:05,910
post hoc stories since obviously you're 
not conducting an experiment in a lab to

1032
00:51:06,681 --> 00:51:11,681
demonstrate the evolution and of course 
that that is so laughable because if 

1033
00:51:11,681 --> 00:51:13,970
that were true,
how is it that astrophysicists study the

1034
00:51:13,971 --> 00:51:17,210
origins of the universe that's 14 
billion years ago,

1035
00:51:17,211 --> 00:51:17,510
right?

1036
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:21,410
They certainly don't conduct an 
experiment in the lab and to build their

1037
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,300
own stars all stars.
Right,

1038
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,650
so but,
but again,

1039
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:29,420
if you're very parodic magically bound 
to manipulating something in the lab,

1040
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:34,720
then somehow evolutionary theory seems 
epistemologically in terms of the 

1041
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,530
philosophy of science.
It seems as though it's.

1042
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:38,990
You're just waving your hand and telling
stories.

1043
00:51:38,991 --> 00:51:43,991
Post hoc stories.
Now the reality is that that's exactly 

1044
00:51:43,991 --> 00:51:44,630
the opposite of what we do.
If anything,

1045
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:49,660
there is no intellectual idea that has 
received as much empirical support as 

1046
00:51:51,111 --> 00:51:53,810
evolution.
I mean it is as clear as gravity.

1047
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:59,380
Yet people somehow can't get around to 
understanding how you could explain 

1048
00:52:00,231 --> 00:52:03,680
something that happened hundreds of 
thousands if not millions of years ago.

1049
00:52:03,681 --> 00:52:06,110
And so the original rejections were 
always,

1050
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:07,010
oh,
but come on,

1051
00:52:07,011 --> 00:52:09,350
we don't take thing on faith here.
We need,

1052
00:52:09,351 --> 00:52:12,380
we need concrete evidence.
So that's how it all started.

1053
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:14,690
So that was the first blow back.

1054
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:19,690
Did you.
When did you hesitate when you first 

1055
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:19,690
experienced this?
Did you go,

1056
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:20,770
man,
I'm going down a dark road and.

1057
00:52:20,771 --> 00:52:21,700
No,
because I.

1058
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:26,840
and that's a great question because I 
think I was fortunate enough to have the

1059
00:52:27,351 --> 00:52:29,960
personality for this endeavor.
In other words,

1060
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:33,650
it's not just that you had to have the 
brains to do what I was doing.

1061
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:39,100
If I would suck my thumb going into a 
fetal position and start crying every 

1062
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:40,520
time somebody rejected me,
rejected my work,

1063
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:42,950
then I wouldn't.
But because I was a fighter,

1064
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:47,840
because I was a high testosterone guy,
then that only compelled me to come back

1065
00:52:47,841 --> 00:52:49,550
and say I'm going to prove these guys 
wrong,

1066
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:54,850
but at the delayed the process,
because I was kept out of many of the 

1067
00:52:54,850 --> 00:52:56,630
leading consumer behavior and marketing 
journals for.

1068
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:01,720
So I kind of went around them.
I published books that became best 

1069
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:05,181
sellers.
I published in medicine and Economics 

1070
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:07,841
and psychology and only recently have I 
tried to come back to the to the folks 

1071
00:53:07,841 --> 00:53:11,000
that I'm most trying to convince and 
those are the consumer psychologist now.

1072
00:53:11,001 --> 00:53:16,001
Luckily I'm their friend,
but for years I was really sort of at 

1073
00:53:16,001 --> 00:53:17,700
the periphery.
It's fascinating as well that the.

1074
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:22,720
The attitudes about the subjects have 
evolved and changed within science and 

1075
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:24,860
within modern academia.
It's,

1076
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:25,670
it's,
it's

1077
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:31,010
really interesting to see this sort of 
evolution of these ideas and the 

1078
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:33,090
acceptance of ideas that didn't exist 
before.

1079
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:38,330
But along with the new craziness,
the new fat acceptance and you know,

1080
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:43,431
all this other nonsense,
this new politically correct terms in 

1081
00:53:43,431 --> 00:53:46,740
this parasitic thinking that you saw 
described so well,

1082
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:51,210
this is the new threat to,
to unbiased,

1083
00:53:51,211 --> 00:53:56,211
objective thinking.
Absolutely is desired and offend no one 

1084
00:53:56,211 --> 00:53:56,550
ever.
Absolutely.

1085
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,900
And,
and you know,

1086
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:01,260
the reality is that now there's a thing 
called,

1087
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:03,990
have you heard of trigger warnings?
Love it.

1088
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:07,020
I love them my whole life to trigger 
warning.

1089
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:11,070
That's exactly what I said.
I'm going to put in my course outline.

1090
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:14,970
Warning life is a trigger warning.
That's it.

1091
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:15,810
So,
I mean,

1092
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:18,000
imagine that it.
As a matter of fact,

1093
00:54:18,001 --> 00:54:18,450
I,
I,

1094
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,640
in my Wellesley talk that I mentioned 
earlier,

1095
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:25,850
I put up a list of,
suggests the suggested topics that these

1096
00:54:27,331 --> 00:54:30,330
trigger warning folks were saying 
required trigger warnings.

1097
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,160
I mean,
it was literally everything.

1098
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,100
That discussion of pregnancy,
of sex,

1099
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:37,380
of disease,
of war,

1100
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,170
of criminality,
of mating,

1101
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:43,640
all of these things could potentially,
uh,

1102
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:48,890
cause some distress to somebody and 
should therefore come with a trigger 

1103
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:52,941
warning.
Now for somebody who escaped Lebanon 

1104
00:54:52,941 --> 00:54:56,670
under immediate threat of execution,
I look at that and say,

1105
00:54:57,061 --> 00:54:57,940
we're,
we're,

1106
00:54:57,941 --> 00:55:02,941
uh,
this is a decadent society in that if 

1107
00:55:02,941 --> 00:55:05,870
that's the things that worry people,
they should really go spend a day in the

1108
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:11,220
neighborhoods where I grew up and then 
maybe they'd have a different 

1109
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:12,210
perspective as to what they should be 
picketing against.

1110
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:16,080
I agree entirely in my term is,
I mean my,

1111
00:55:16,110 --> 00:55:21,110
not my term,
my thought is that people are just so 

1112
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:23,670
used to this soft life of everything 
being really easy to achieve,

1113
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:27,840
that they have never developed this 
understanding of the,

1114
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:32,870
first of all,
how fortunate we are to be living this 

1115
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:34,950
in this time and age to experience this 
easy life that we live in,

1116
00:55:34,951 --> 00:55:37,050
but that we're really lucky.

1117
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:42,470
We're really lucky and to focus on a 
bunch of nonsense and to get carried 

1118
00:55:43,921 --> 00:55:48,921
away thinking about all these ultra 
supersensitive notions and to dwell on 

1119
00:55:50,581 --> 00:55:55,581
them as if in some way you're going to 
make the world a better place by doing 

1120
00:55:55,581 --> 00:55:56,070
now.
Like it's nonsense.

1121
00:55:56,071 --> 00:55:58,590
It's preposterous because it's their 
posers.

1122
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:01,110
Right?
And so a way to demonstrate that.

1123
00:56:01,111 --> 00:56:05,120
I care,
but in doing it with very little cost,

1124
00:56:05,121 --> 00:56:10,121
to me,
it takes a lot more guts to stand up 

1125
00:56:10,121 --> 00:56:12,630
against Islam than to stand up against 
some hick evolution,

1126
00:56:12,631 --> 00:56:15,510
denying senator who's Republican.
So for example,

1127
00:56:15,511 --> 00:56:20,511
if I look at my facebook friends,
if I put up a post that is critical of 

1128
00:56:22,081 --> 00:56:25,390
the senator who was a Redneck,
a Republican,

1129
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:30,100
I'll get from my academic colleagues 80 
likes and at some inane,

1130
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:35,150
silly thing,
but if I put some horrifying reality 

1131
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:37,720
about 200,000
Syrians being butchered,

1132
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:43,060
they are so loud in their silence 
because that's scary.

1133
00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:44,620
Right?
And so the,

1134
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:46,960
for example,
the western feminists are very,

1135
00:56:46,961 --> 00:56:51,961
very quick to chastise David Letterman 
if he makes a sexist joke or whatever it

1136
00:56:52,541 --> 00:56:55,270
was to his intern that shows great 
courage,

1137
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:59,290
but so to speak against genital 
mutilation in the Islamic world or other

1138
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:03,190
parts of the world or all kinds of other
injustices that women face.

1139
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,140
Well,
we should be quiet about that.

1140
00:57:05,141 --> 00:57:07,840
I mean,
look at the Ion Hirsi Ali issue.

1141
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:08,920
I don't know.
Are you familiar with that?

1142
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:09,440
No.
No.

1143
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:12,040
Do you know who I am?
Hirsi Ali is in Hirsi.

1144
00:57:12,041 --> 00:57:17,041
Ali is a woman who was born into Islam 
who escaped an arranged marriage,

1145
00:57:17,201 --> 00:57:19,420
move to,
to Netherlands,

1146
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:25,020
became a Dutch parliamentarian,
and then was part of a documentary that 

1147
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:26,460
was offensive to,
to,

1148
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:31,680
uh,
some Muslims and then she had to have 

1149
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:31,680
then protection for the rest of her 
life,

1150
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:36,210
now has moved to the United States and 
has spent pretty much her entire career 

1151
00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:37,870
fighting for the rights of women,
not just Muslim women,

1152
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:41,200
women in general,
but of course many Muslim women in those

1153
00:57:41,201 --> 00:57:42,880
areas are,
are mistreated.

1154
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:46,000
So Brandeis University,
the sites to bestow her,

1155
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:47,500
this is very recently,
a couple of months ago,

1156
00:57:47,501 --> 00:57:49,570
but still bestow her a,
I think,

1157
00:57:49,571 --> 00:57:54,571
uh,
maybe honorary doctorate or speech 

1158
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:57,481
convocation to speak at the convocation.
And then all of the professors rallied 

1159
00:57:58,630 --> 00:58:03,630
against this woman who is speaking on 
behalf of half the population called 

1160
00:58:04,661 --> 00:58:05,740
women.
Right?

1161
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:09,910
And they said this is a hate monger and 
Islamophobic,

1162
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:10,300
blah,
blah,

1163
00:58:10,301 --> 00:58:12,550
blah.
And so they rescinded her invitation.

1164
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,380
Oh,
and there you go.

1165
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:16,680
So,
you know,

1166
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:21,710
I mean,
we're pretty much lost as a society if 

1167
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:25,270
we can't identify who the heroes are and
who is on the right side of each issue,

1168
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:26,530
right?
Not just that,

1169
00:58:26,531 --> 00:58:28,750
but the educators are the ones that are 
having this issue.

1170
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:33,780
The educators are the ones that are 
having a hard time recognizing who's on 

1171
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:36,781
the right side of things that I think 
there's one very important thing that 

1172
00:58:36,781 --> 00:58:37,160
you,
uh,

1173
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:40,060
you brought up and it's the social 
aspect,

1174
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:45,270
the social gratification,
that's social reward aspect of 

1175
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:49,951
supporting things that we all agree upon
that these Hicks senators are bad,

1176
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:55,300
that you know,
and then the scariness of Islam,

1177
00:58:55,520 --> 00:59:00,520
the,
the scariness of criticizing the Muslim 

1178
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:00,520
world.

1179
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,380
And then this,
this concept of Islamophobia that's sort

1180
00:59:02,381 --> 00:59:07,381
of gotten to people's minds,
but that thing that people do where they

1181
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:10,660
seek out what I call socially 
Progressive Brownie points.

1182
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:14,560
Exactly like men who declare themselves 
openly feminists,

1183
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:16,600
male feminists like,
look,

1184
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:21,690
I'm a humanist.
I believe that we are all just brothers 

1185
00:59:22,131 --> 00:59:23,810
and sisters on this planet.
All of us,

1186
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:26,180
including people and other cultures and 
countries.

1187
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:29,690
And I'm not a nationalist.
I think it's all nonsense.

1188
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:34,691
I really do.
I mean I would love it if we could all 

1189
00:59:34,691 --> 00:59:36,880
understand each other.
I think it would make a lot more sense 

1190
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:37,850
if we spoke one language so I could 
understand people in China,

1191
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:43,120
but I don't feel about them any 
differently than I feel about a guy 

1192
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,330
lives down the street.
I try very hard to work on that.

1193
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:49,540
So when I get this,
this thing where people start 

1194
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:53,800
identifying with one gender and one 
gender specifically and there's another 

1195
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:58,451
thing that men are doing where they're 
not only proclaiming themselves as a 

1196
00:59:58,451 --> 01:00:01,550
male feminist,
but they're also saying that if they are

1197
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:06,640
unjustly accused of something that they 
would happily be unjustly accused of 

1198
01:00:07,671 --> 01:00:11,780
something if it could somehow another 
prevent women from being persecuted.

1199
01:00:11,830 --> 01:00:15,710
What martyrs in that amazing.
They're so cool and strong like that,

1200
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:21,010
but I think it's.
I don't know if you know the term 

1201
01:00:21,010 --> 01:00:21,170
identity politics is that I've heard the
term,

1202
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:26,440
so basically you have sort of this 
balkanization of different identity 

1203
01:00:26,931 --> 01:00:31,220
groups and there is what's called a 
poker identity game.

1204
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:36,340
You know which,
which identity group has larger 

1205
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:39,641
victimology and greater grievances and 
the top group that you really can't 

1206
01:00:39,861 --> 01:00:42,500
touch our,
our people of the Muslim faith.

1207
01:00:42,530 --> 01:00:46,950
What about Islamic transgender male 
feminist that that's.

1208
01:00:46,990 --> 01:00:51,990
That's the royal flush.
That's you're holding the royal flush 

1209
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:52,020
right there.
You're a fucking.

1210
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:57,700
Yeah,
you can't be beat and you've got five 

1211
01:00:57,700 --> 01:00:59,951
jokers at my university and my 
university right now in Montreal.

1212
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:05,531
At one point I sat precisely because 
people had a sense of some of the 

1213
01:01:05,531 --> 01:01:08,621
positions I held.
They asked me to come in and sit on a 

1214
01:01:08,621 --> 01:01:08,690
religious accommodation committee.

1215
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:14,950
We're a secular university in a secular 
society officially as the official law.

1216
01:01:15,350 --> 01:01:20,350
So what does it mean to say that we're 
going to now enact a religious 

1217
01:01:20,350 --> 01:01:24,611
accommodation policy?
I mean that's like saying I am a virgin 

1218
01:01:24,611 --> 01:01:27,491
but I'm pregnant.
I mean it's really the term can't make 

1219
01:01:27,491 --> 01:01:27,491
sense how.
Right.

1220
01:01:27,491 --> 01:01:32,020
So my position was I am equally non 
pliant to anybody's religious beliefs.

1221
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:37,030
If Jews come to my class and say,
we want to do young people,

1222
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:37,430
blah,
blah,

1223
01:01:37,431 --> 01:01:42,431
blah,
well I'm Jewish and I'm still going to 

1224
01:01:42,431 --> 01:01:44,951
come to the lecture,
but now if Moslems come and say we want 

1225
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:47,780
to take Hash for three weeks at Mecca so
we won't be showing up to your class for

1226
01:01:47,781 --> 01:01:48,950
three weeks.
Well,

1227
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:52,340
I'm equally unreceptive that idea.
Well,

1228
01:01:52,490 --> 01:01:57,490
it seemed like most people were pretty 
happy with my general position as long 

1229
01:01:57,490 --> 01:01:58,430
as it didn't apply to this one 
particular group.

1230
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:00,530
Now that suicidal,
right?

1231
01:02:00,531 --> 01:02:05,531
That can't be because that's already 
institutionalizing the fact that people 

1232
01:02:05,531 --> 01:02:06,980
are not all equal.
Right?

1233
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:11,540
Some people deserve more accommodations 
than others.

1234
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:12,710
That's dangerous.
Right?

1235
01:02:13,070 --> 01:02:16,670
That's so in the US.
Freedom of religion also includes,

1236
01:02:16,671 --> 01:02:17,780
as you know.
I mean it's a cliche.

1237
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:20,130
Freedom from religion,
be religious,

1238
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:25,190
just don't put it in my face,
but I think in our desperate desire to 

1239
01:02:25,190 --> 01:02:26,760
constantly accommodate people would 
going down the wrong path,

1240
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,370
but not just constantly accommodate 
people,

1241
01:02:29,371 --> 01:02:33,060
but accommodate people that are 
perceived to have been persecuted,

1242
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:38,090
only not accommodate.
People that have a contrary point of 

1243
01:02:38,090 --> 01:02:42,051
view,
not debate them or look at them all 

1244
01:02:42,051 --> 01:02:42,630
objectively true and consider all the 
various possibilities.

1245
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:47,780
Have we been incorrect in our thinking?
Is this a possible like the woman that 

1246
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:48,060
you were talking about that from 
Brandeis.

1247
01:02:48,061 --> 01:02:48,480
I mean,
that's,

1248
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:53,740
that's unbelievably shocking for someone
who have gone through something so 

1249
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:56,040
horrifying to be escaping running for 
their life,

1250
01:02:56,070 --> 01:03:00,310
really escaping to America and then to 
be called an Islamophobia.

1251
01:03:00,330 --> 01:03:02,100
That's right.
And as you said,

1252
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:05,880
who is spearheading that?
The professors and by the way,

1253
01:03:05,881 --> 01:03:07,980
Brandeis University,
as you may know,

1254
01:03:08,130 --> 01:03:13,130
was founded by a liberal a lot by 
brandeis who was trying to kind of found

1255
01:03:14,911 --> 01:03:19,911
an institution that would be open to all
that would be pluralistic precisely 

1256
01:03:19,911 --> 01:03:23,240
because of some of the antisemitism that
Jewish students would have faced at some

1257
01:03:23,241 --> 01:03:28,241
of the sort of northeastern schools.
And so the school is founded on these 

1258
01:03:28,241 --> 01:03:32,451
principles.
And then at the first opportunity you 

1259
01:03:32,451 --> 01:03:34,761
violate everything that you stand for.
Is there any movement to try to change 

1260
01:03:34,761 --> 01:03:35,850
this?
Is there any discussion to try to,

1261
01:03:36,530 --> 01:03:40,720
uh,
this sort of real issue with academia as

1262
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:43,260
well?
If I can be a modest,

1263
01:03:43,261 --> 01:03:46,010
I think it's guys like me who are 
trying,

1264
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:51,110
who are really in the wilderness who try
to come out of the woodworks and have 

1265
01:03:51,110 --> 01:03:54,090
the courage and the big festivals to try
to do that,

1266
01:03:54,091 --> 01:03:56,790
but I think most people have heard 
instinct,

1267
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:59,070
but even if you say that you have the 
testicles to do this,

1268
01:03:59,071 --> 01:03:59,670
how dare you.

1269
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:03,180
You can't do this with ovaries.
Is that what you're saying?

1270
01:04:04,670 --> 01:04:07,390
I apologize for having said that.
I have testicle now.

1271
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:09,690
It's this.
It's an expression of courage.

1272
01:04:09,691 --> 01:04:12,570
Women have balls too.
I know a lot of checks with balls if you

1273
01:04:12,571 --> 01:04:14,880
look at it that way,
but it's unfortunate that a woman has to

1274
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:15,900
hear that and go,
oh well,

1275
01:04:15,901 --> 01:04:18,260
great.
It's associated with male gender have.

1276
01:04:18,390 --> 01:04:20,970
Well that's true,
but if a guy is a great guy,

1277
01:04:20,971 --> 01:04:22,020
oh,
that guy's the tits.

1278
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:25,050
I mean that is something that people say
to like my friend Steve,

1279
01:04:25,051 --> 01:04:30,051
he says every everything is good.
He calls titties titties movie man.

1280
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:35,400
Like I used to be a competitive soccer 
player and the kind of trash talking 

1281
01:04:37,951 --> 01:04:42,951
that would happen as,
as you would know your athlete is 

1282
01:04:42,951 --> 01:04:45,460
astounding.
The things that would be sad for example

1283
01:04:45,461 --> 01:04:49,560
of calling you some homophobic slur name
go to move,

1284
01:04:49,561 --> 01:04:49,830
right?

1285
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:51,120
Or,
or calling you.

1286
01:04:51,121 --> 01:04:56,121
I mean,
I remember at one point I played in the 

1287
01:04:56,121 --> 01:04:56,850
league called the Black Lake where you 
would only to not to non black guys.

1288
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:58,920
I was one of them and so they,
you know,

1289
01:04:58,930 --> 01:05:00,870
I would if somebody with tackling and 
say,

1290
01:05:00,871 --> 01:05:02,220
you know,
stop whining,

1291
01:05:02,221 --> 01:05:05,940
get up white bitch right now in today's 
now.

1292
01:05:05,970 --> 01:05:10,970
Usually the way I fought that as I say,
I'm not going to get by this guy next 

1293
01:05:11,491 --> 01:05:13,230
time around and I'm going to score a 
goal.

1294
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:15,900
I didn't kind of curl into a fetal 
position.

1295
01:05:15,901 --> 01:05:17,980
Start crying.
Well today they are.

1296
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:21,610
I mean facetiously that are commissar 
standing around the field,

1297
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:24,040
making sure that nobody,
others,

1298
01:05:24,041 --> 01:05:29,041
any of these slur words because then you
could be taken to hate speech code 

1299
01:05:29,041 --> 01:05:31,900
tribunal mean in Canada.
We have hate speech laws.

1300
01:05:32,210 --> 01:05:33,100
They.
How could that be?

1301
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:33,670
Now,
of course,

1302
01:05:33,671 --> 01:05:38,671
I'm not suggesting that we should all be
insulting one another and of course we 

1303
01:05:38,671 --> 01:05:38,980
should all be kind and gentle to each 
other,

1304
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:42,460
but the idea that if you tell me a white
bitch,

1305
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:47,520
I could actually impose upon you to go 
to a hate speech tribunals is 

1306
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:48,100
astounding.

1307
01:05:48,130 --> 01:05:48,410
I mean,
what?

1308
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:53,610
What's freedom of speech?
Freedom of speech is the right to also 

1309
01:05:53,610 --> 01:05:53,610
be an asshole.
Correct.

1310
01:05:53,610 --> 01:05:58,400
And,
but unfortunately now everything is 

1311
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:01,111
sanitized.
Everything is just freedom of speech is 

1312
01:06:01,111 --> 01:06:01,180
the right to be an asshole.
But on,

1313
01:06:01,230 --> 01:06:03,550
in other terms,
freedom of speech,

1314
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:08,580
on the other hand,
in response to your being an asshole is 

1315
01:06:08,580 --> 01:06:11,941
the right to ostracize you like the 
right to get you out of social groups 

1316
01:06:11,941 --> 01:06:13,270
and that's how you recognize asphalts 
exactly,

1317
01:06:13,271 --> 01:06:18,271
but when you sanitize the world and 
remove half the language and put trigger

1318
01:06:18,701 --> 01:06:20,380
warnings out for everything that 
everybody says,

1319
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:23,650
it's very difficult to get to the heart 
of what someone's trying to communicate,

1320
01:06:23,651 --> 01:06:25,990
right?
When we're making mouth noises,

1321
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:30,640
trying to express our thoughts.
And we're limited in such an amazing way

1322
01:06:30,641 --> 01:06:32,770
by so many different forms of 
expression.

1323
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:33,510
Well,
a,

1324
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:38,590
here's a great example that's happening 
all over the West and certainly in 

1325
01:06:38,590 --> 01:06:42,151
Canada and the US try to give a lecture 
or invite somebody either that has a pro

1326
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:48,540
Israel position or an anti Islam 
position and go to UC Irvine and see 

1327
01:06:49,241 --> 01:06:49,780
what happens.

1328
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:51,000
Uh,
the,

1329
01:06:51,001 --> 01:06:53,590
the,
the former ambassador of Israel tried to

1330
01:06:53,591 --> 01:06:57,490
come and give a lecture and I mean,
it wasn't an incendiary thing.

1331
01:06:57,491 --> 01:07:02,491
He wasn't going to be saying some 
horribly controversial things and yet 

1332
01:07:02,491 --> 01:07:05,170
they tried to shut them down.
Benjamin Netanyahu,

1333
01:07:05,171 --> 01:07:10,030
the current prime minister of Israel was
shut down at my university.

1334
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:13,030
Wow.
At Concordia University in Montreal,

1335
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:18,300
the Prime Minister of a democratic 
elected government are only supposed to 

1336
01:07:19,450 --> 01:07:24,450
true ally in the Middle East was unable 
to speak because there was great a 

1337
01:07:25,090 --> 01:07:29,380
threat of danger.
Now that's a v astonishingly dangerous,

1338
01:07:29,381 --> 01:07:29,740
right?
I mean,

1339
01:07:29,741 --> 01:07:30,100
if,
if,

1340
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:34,450
if that guy can't speak,
probably you and I are not going to have

1341
01:07:34,451 --> 01:07:37,000
much of a voice.
There was a university in Toronto,

1342
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:42,360
I forget which one,
but there was a speech by a guy who was 

1343
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:44,810
considered to be a men's rights advocate
with the,

1344
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:48,130
the,
the insult as they call them Mras and he

1345
01:07:48,131 --> 01:07:53,131
had written a book and he was giving the
speech and these feminists were 

1346
01:07:53,131 --> 01:07:54,100
protesting and York University was at 
York.

1347
01:07:54,130 --> 01:07:58,260
I think it was your and violent 
opposition and what he had,

1348
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:01,390
what they had said that he said and what
he actually said.

1349
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:06,510
It was so completely diametrically op.
I mean was so incorrect that it was 

1350
01:08:06,941 --> 01:08:08,920
almost like they'd never read what he 
had said.

1351
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:12,730
They had just decided that this was a 
target because he was a.

1352
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:17,820
He was an example.
He was a figurehead of the patriarchy 

1353
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:20,590
and so they.
These people were showing up for these 

1354
01:08:20,590 --> 01:08:20,590
lectures like,
look,

1355
01:08:20,590 --> 01:08:20,590
I,
I,

1356
01:08:20,590 --> 01:08:22,670
like I said,
I read websites that I don't agree with.

1357
01:08:22,671 --> 01:08:27,290
I watch a republican debates.
I watch.

1358
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:33,040
I watched these bizarre Republican Fox 
News talk shows where they have these 

1359
01:08:33,561 --> 01:08:35,870
insane views of the world.
I don't agree with them.

1360
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:40,990
I watch it because I'm fascinated.
I watch it because I want to know what 

1361
01:08:40,990 --> 01:08:41,050
this knucklehead thinks about,
you know,

1362
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:42,440
God and climate change.

1363
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:44,540
God has a great sense of humor.
You know,

1364
01:08:44,541 --> 01:08:45,890
look the world,
have we.

1365
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:47,840
We played a video the other day of a 
woman who's.

1366
01:08:47,930 --> 01:08:50,180
She's running for Congress.
It's crazy bitch.

1367
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:51,180
She,
she was.

1368
01:08:51,310 --> 01:08:56,310
She said,
I can prove there's no global warming 

1369
01:08:56,310 --> 01:08:56,330
with a simple tool,
a thermometer,

1370
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:59,360
and she pulls it out like I'm fascinated
by that lady.

1371
01:08:59,361 --> 01:09:01,070
I will watch that lady talk.
It doesn't mean I'm.

1372
01:09:01,110 --> 01:09:03,080
I agreed with her.
So these,

1373
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:05,360
these feminists is radical feminists as 
it were.

1374
01:09:05,530 --> 01:09:06,860
Whatever your radical.
Anyway,

1375
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:10,460
anything we usually an idiot,
but these radical feminists,

1376
01:09:10,461 --> 01:09:12,890
we're keeping people from attending 
this.

1377
01:09:13,010 --> 01:09:15,760
Not just the people that were speaking,
you know,

1378
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:18,140
they weren't protesting the people that 
were speaking,

1379
01:09:18,290 --> 01:09:21,120
they were screaming and yelling at the 
people they're trying to go into,

1380
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:23,750
listen to this person talk,
agree or disagree.

1381
01:09:23,751 --> 01:09:28,751
The idea that you are trying to oppose 
or trying to stop you are in opposition 

1382
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:32,720
of a person listening to a contrary 
point of view.

1383
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,130
That's amazing.
Well,

1384
01:09:34,131 --> 01:09:36,140
I already dangerous,
very dangerous.

1385
01:09:36,141 --> 01:09:39,110
I wrote an article on my psychology 
today blog,

1386
01:09:39,111 --> 01:09:44,111
uh,
maybe about two years ago where this 

1387
01:09:44,111 --> 01:09:45,910
wasn't my study.
I was just simply summarizing somebody 

1388
01:09:45,910 --> 01:09:46,610
else's work,
what he had basically done,

1389
01:09:46,611 --> 01:09:48,020
or I think there were several 
researchers,

1390
01:09:48,021 --> 01:09:53,021
they had looked at the political 
leanings of professors at American 

1391
01:09:53,691 --> 01:09:55,590
universities,
uh,

1392
01:09:55,610 --> 01:10:00,610
whether they're Democrat or Republican 
and they actually then broke it down by 

1393
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:02,270
departments.
So for example,

1394
01:10:02,271 --> 01:10:07,271
what would be the Democrat versus 
Republican ratio in sociology versus in 

1395
01:10:07,271 --> 01:10:11,620
physics?
What they found is that I think if I'm 

1396
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:14,771
going on memory,
I think that the ratio is about five to 

1397
01:10:14,771 --> 01:10:17,531
one Democrat to Republican and in some 
departments,

1398
01:10:17,930 --> 01:10:19,640
most notably,
for example,

1399
01:10:19,641 --> 01:10:21,920
in the humanities and sociology and so 
on,

1400
01:10:21,980 --> 01:10:24,670
it was 44 to one.
Now I,

1401
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:27,290
I,
I didn't present this as this is good or

1402
01:10:27,291 --> 01:10:32,291
this is bad,
but I certainly was trying to make the 

1403
01:10:32,291 --> 01:10:33,590
point that on some issues that's not a 
good idea.

1404
01:10:33,650 --> 01:10:36,170
For example,
what should be fiscal policy,

1405
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:37,530
um,
you know,

1406
01:10:37,550 --> 01:10:39,590
what should be our position regarding 
immigration.

1407
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:40,590
Uh,
uh,

1408
01:10:40,610 --> 01:10:42,440
what,
what is the position regarding the death

1409
01:10:42,441 --> 01:10:47,441
penalty?
These are not clear sort of 

1410
01:10:47,441 --> 01:10:47,441
scientifically,
you know?

1411
01:10:47,441 --> 01:10:47,441
Right.
I mean,

1412
01:10:47,441 --> 01:10:50,980
it depends.
And to have a sanitized campus,

1413
01:10:51,290 --> 01:10:54,350
we're only one group of people really 
dominate.

1414
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:56,690
I thought was dangerous.
You should've seen the blowback.

1415
01:10:56,691 --> 01:10:58,570
I got there.
Now,

1416
01:10:58,970 --> 01:11:03,350
the only thing that protects me in such 
situations is that being Canadian,

1417
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:08,680
I could say these things without 
appearing as though I have a dog in the 

1418
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:08,680
fight.
Hey,

1419
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:10,910
I'm not Democrat,
I'm Republican Canadian,

1420
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:16,180
so I must be unbiased and in a sense 
they'll give me a bit of a get out of 

1421
01:11:16,180 --> 01:11:18,810
jail card because I.
It doesn't appear as though I'm fighting

1422
01:11:18,811 --> 01:11:23,811
for one or the other,
but still the blow back was astonishing 

1423
01:11:23,811 --> 01:11:25,320
because how dare I point to this as 
though it were a bad thing.

1424
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:30,320
I mean,
everybody knows that every Democrat is 

1425
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:31,560
perfect on everything and every 
Republican is an idiot,

1426
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:33,690
you know,
toothless evolution,

1427
01:11:33,691 --> 01:11:38,691
denying buffoon.
And that strikes me as astonishing from 

1428
01:11:38,691 --> 01:11:39,960
otherwise intelligent people.
The world is more nuanced,

1429
01:11:39,961 --> 01:11:44,961
right?
There are many issues on which I agree 

1430
01:11:44,961 --> 01:11:47,061
with Democrats as a Canadian.
They are a few issues on which I 

1431
01:11:47,061 --> 01:11:47,610
actually agree more with Republicans.
Uh,

1432
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:49,830
and so I kind of pick and choose my 
battles,

1433
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:54,450
but that's not how it is in academia,
but in their defense though,

1434
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:59,640
the points that are taken by the 
Republicans so often are there really,

1435
01:12:01,410 --> 01:12:04,740
if you had to choose,
like one side that's paying attention to

1436
01:12:04,741 --> 01:12:07,510
science and one side that's paying 
attention to religion,

1437
01:12:07,511 --> 01:12:10,050
it's pretty clear except well listen,
and I'm going to have solutionist.

1438
01:12:10,051 --> 01:12:12,360
So obviously when it's going to come on 
that issue,

1439
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:15,180
I'm going to be a lot more with the 
Democrats then all the.

1440
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:17,880
But for example,
my position,

1441
01:12:17,881 --> 01:12:19,590
you may disagree.
I hope you don't kick me out of here.

1442
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:23,040
I will never take you out of your very 
kind of the death penalty.

1443
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:28,760
I think that if you are having raped and
killed 10 children and we've got the DNA

1444
01:12:28,830 --> 01:12:31,170
of,
of you on the potential,

1445
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:33,930
it's incontrovertible that you are 
guilty.

1446
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:39,340
Uh,
I don't see it as a terrible moral issue

1447
01:12:39,870 --> 01:12:43,200
that we could potentially discuss the 
possibility of executing you.

1448
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:45,150
As a matter of fact,
I think that in some cases,

1449
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:49,380
the amount of rights that we give to 
otherwise horrifying monsters,

1450
01:12:49,381 --> 01:12:52,290
that itself is barbaric.
So on that dimension,

1451
01:12:52,350 --> 01:12:56,370
I'm likely to be much more quote 
Republican and I am as well.

1452
01:12:56,430 --> 01:13:01,430
I agree with you 100 percent.
So know nuance thinking is as a mark of 

1453
01:13:01,430 --> 01:13:03,030
somebody who kind of has a sense of what
the world looks like.

1454
01:13:03,330 --> 01:13:08,330
And I think that that's also a mark of 
someone who doesn't have a dog in the 

1455
01:13:08,330 --> 01:13:08,820
fight.
As I said before.

1456
01:13:09,030 --> 01:13:14,030
I think when you look at the world,
there's a lot of variables that must be 

1457
01:13:14,030 --> 01:13:18,291
taken into consideration as soon as you 
deny those variables because you have a 

1458
01:13:18,291 --> 01:13:20,340
specific stance.
It's a predetermined pattern of thinking

1459
01:13:20,341 --> 01:13:24,300
that you've aligned yourself with.
I'm on the left and as a Democrat,

1460
01:13:24,530 --> 01:13:29,530
like I was having a conversation with 
someone the other day and they were 

1461
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:31,581
talking to you about upcoming elections 
and they said if we lose the house,

1462
01:13:31,711 --> 01:13:34,110
if we lose,
like he's a fucking comedian.

1463
01:13:34,740 --> 01:13:39,740
He's a comedian that I'm talking to and 
he's talking about the Democrats and 

1464
01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:40,080
he's on team.
And I'm like,

1465
01:13:40,081 --> 01:13:43,310
wow,
I'm 100 percent for the death penalty in

1466
01:13:43,311 --> 01:13:46,050
terms in like a Ted Bundy type 
character.

1467
01:13:46,051 --> 01:13:48,570
Some monster.
But my problem with it,

1468
01:13:48,571 --> 01:13:53,571
my number one problem with it is that I 
don't believe that the system is a good 

1469
01:13:54,151 --> 01:13:54,930
system.
I don't.

1470
01:13:54,990 --> 01:13:59,990
I don't believe it's an infallible.
I think there's a lot of issues when it 

1471
01:13:59,990 --> 01:14:03,510
comes to people who are prosecutors who 
deny evidence,

1472
01:14:03,511 --> 01:14:05,170
withhold evidence.
They,

1473
01:14:05,180 --> 01:14:10,180
they,
they know that they're wrong and they 

1474
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:10,180
still arrest people.
They still prosecute people.

1475
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:12,490
This has been so many instances of that.
I can't trust

1476
01:14:12,670 --> 01:14:14,230
their judgment.
I can't trust.

1477
01:14:14,410 --> 01:14:19,410
There was a video the other day of a man
who's a police officer pulling some 

1478
01:14:19,410 --> 01:14:23,611
woman she was trying to resist.
He threw it to the ground and he's 

1479
01:14:23,611 --> 01:14:23,700
beating her,
punching her in the face in,

1480
01:14:23,701 --> 01:14:28,701
in Los Angeles,
and as long as that is a part of our 

1481
01:14:28,701 --> 01:14:28,870
legal system that this,
this guy.

1482
01:14:29,050 --> 01:14:30,700
I mean she wasn't fighting back.
He wasn't.

1483
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:33,430
He wasn't fighting for his life.
She was resisting.

1484
01:14:33,431 --> 01:14:35,320
I don't know what the circumstances 
were,

1485
01:14:35,321 --> 01:14:40,321
but whatever I know is,
if that is the only way you can handle 

1486
01:14:40,321 --> 01:14:40,321
that woman,
you shouldn't be a police officer.

1487
01:14:40,321 --> 01:14:42,400
And as ridiculous,
as long as that exists,

1488
01:14:42,610 --> 01:14:47,610
that's part of our legal system.
That's just a human flaw that exists on 

1489
01:14:47,610 --> 01:14:51,931
all levels that will exist as far as a 
police officer who's on the street that 

1490
01:14:51,931 --> 01:14:54,040
will exist as far as a prosecutor,
as a judge,

1491
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:59,440
a person running a prison.
There's going to be human flaws and the 

1492
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:03,451
entire system.
And that's the only reason why I 

1493
01:15:03,451 --> 01:15:04,060
hesitate as far as.
But in that sense,

1494
01:15:04,061 --> 01:15:09,061
yeah,
I'm way more Republican than I am 

1495
01:15:09,061 --> 01:15:09,061
Democrat.

1496
01:15:09,061 --> 01:15:11,250
I,
I tell you a story about a sort of 

1497
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:11,250
police misconduct,
uh,

1498
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:16,160
many years ago I had met a guy who would
serve as a public defender in the La 

1499
01:15:18,971 --> 01:15:21,500
county system.
And as we were chatting,

1500
01:15:21,501 --> 01:15:26,501
you know,
I was very interested in all of this 

1501
01:15:26,501 --> 01:15:26,501
stuff that he had to say.
He said to me,

1502
01:15:26,501 --> 01:15:29,630
one advice I could give you is don't 
ever do anything in California that will

1503
01:15:29,631 --> 01:15:32,170
have you end up in La County jail.
And I said,

1504
01:15:32,171 --> 01:15:32,860
Oh,
why's that?

1505
01:15:33,370 --> 01:15:35,380
I said,
give me an example of why would somebody

1506
01:15:35,381 --> 01:15:36,040
like me.
He goes,

1507
01:15:36,041 --> 01:15:40,510
let's suppose you were a recidivist 
drink and drive kind of guy,

1508
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:43,720
and the cops are pissed off at you.
They'll take you to the jail,

1509
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:48,750
they'll throw you with all the 
gangbangers and they'll simply scream 

1510
01:15:48,750 --> 01:15:50,170
out fresh fish out of water.
That's exactly the term that he used,

1511
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:54,910
which basically is the code word for 
have that in boys and we won't,

1512
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:57,990
we won't hurt here.
His screams and,

1513
01:15:58,180 --> 01:15:59,270
and I remember this,
this,

1514
01:15:59,350 --> 01:16:04,350
this isn't in the late eighties.
And subsequently I actually met the son 

1515
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:10,440
of the sky coincidentally and later 
found out that that was his father by 

1516
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:10,990
quincy.
He was an academic also.

1517
01:16:11,470 --> 01:16:12,230
But anyway,
so that's,

1518
01:16:12,231 --> 01:16:14,380
that's an example of misconduct where,
you know,

1519
01:16:14,381 --> 01:16:17,950
if you piss off these gaps,
they could do all sorts of things to you

1520
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:20,920
that can have some profound consequences
on your body.

1521
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:22,330
Yeah.
I just want to state for the record,

1522
01:16:22,331 --> 01:16:27,310
I'm a big supporter of law enforcement.
Always have been one bad cop is not cops

1523
01:16:27,311 --> 01:16:29,440
make bad,
make all cops are bad.

1524
01:16:30,940 --> 01:16:32,230
Humans were flawed,
you know,

1525
01:16:32,231 --> 01:16:35,380
not every,
not every doctor is a good person.

1526
01:16:35,410 --> 01:16:37,540
I mean,
I have a friend who used to work when he

1527
01:16:37,541 --> 01:16:42,541
was younger,
he worked at a resort and he said he 

1528
01:16:42,541 --> 01:16:46,291
would overhear these doctors very 
specifically remembered overhearing 

1529
01:16:46,291 --> 01:16:49,801
these doctors bragging about talking 
this guy into a surgery and about how 

1530
01:16:49,801 --> 01:16:50,510
he's going to buy a car now,
you know,

1531
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:50,890
like,
uh,

1532
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:53,500
that's a,
that's a new whatever it was,

1533
01:16:53,670 --> 01:16:54,490
porsche,
whatever.

1534
01:16:54,491 --> 01:16:55,400
For me,
you know,

1535
01:16:55,660 --> 01:17:00,660
this.
And he was bragging about talking to 

1536
01:17:00,660 --> 01:17:00,660
this kind of surgery.
Incredible.

1537
01:17:00,660 --> 01:17:00,660
Yeah,
I mean,

1538
01:17:00,660 --> 01:17:02,620
that's real.
That does happen.

1539
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:05,950
You know,
there there's bad people in all walks of

1540
01:17:05,951 --> 01:17:10,951
life and I think that that is my number,
my only really resistance to something 

1541
01:17:11,841 --> 01:17:16,841
like the death penalty.
But when you look at the recidivism 

1542
01:17:16,841 --> 01:17:17,390
rates for child rapists,
it's just through the roof.

1543
01:17:17,391 --> 01:17:18,200
It's crazy.

1544
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:22,550
I don't know if you've seen the stat I,
and I can't cite who came up with it,

1545
01:17:22,551 --> 01:17:25,850
but uh,
apparently when you catch a pedophile,

1546
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:30,880
he's on average committed 100 
transgressions prior to you catching him

1547
01:17:31,311 --> 01:17:32,780
for the first time.
Right.

1548
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:37,610
So,
so why does this guy benefit from all of

1549
01:17:37,611 --> 01:17:39,010
our legals?
I mean it,

1550
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:39,590
you know,
it.

1551
01:17:39,650 --> 01:17:44,650
If you've done this stuff so many times,
why do we have to be humane?

1552
01:17:45,170 --> 01:17:48,890
I would actually argue it's inhumane to 
be so human to this guy,

1553
01:17:49,220 --> 01:17:52,310
and I wrote an article on on psychology 
today where I was talking about,

1554
01:17:52,610 --> 01:17:57,290
I don't know if you remember the case 
with the two guys in Connecticut who did

1555
01:17:57,291 --> 01:18:02,291
a home invasion and they raped the girls
and the mother and set the house on 

1556
01:18:03,171 --> 01:18:04,520
fire,
beat the father,

1557
01:18:04,521 --> 01:18:09,521
but he survived and so on and so it was 
coming up to their death penalty and so 

1558
01:18:09,521 --> 01:18:11,670
I sort of as a tribute to that case,
I wrote a,

1559
01:18:12,030 --> 01:18:17,030
an article on my psychology today blog,
which I think I titled is the Death 

1560
01:18:17,030 --> 01:18:18,650
Penalty Barbaric and I was arguing that 
in for these kinds of guys.

1561
01:18:18,651 --> 01:18:19,250
No,
it's not.

1562
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:24,760
While you should have seen my 
progressive enlightened cafe sipping 

1563
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:28,220
academic colleagues scoff at my barber 
isn't right.

1564
01:18:28,730 --> 01:18:32,330
What kind of Hick must it be to actually
even hold those sentences?

1565
01:18:32,350 --> 01:18:33,430
Well,
I got news for you,

1566
01:18:33,431 --> 01:18:34,450
man.
If it comes between,

1567
01:18:34,451 --> 01:18:39,451
put me in jail for the rest of my life 
and some cage where I have to be 

1568
01:18:39,451 --> 01:18:40,920
constantly in fear of men raping me and 
stabbing me with tooth parses,

1569
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:46,380
sharp knives.
I'll take death exactly that way and I 

1570
01:18:46,380 --> 01:18:46,380
think we should all,
if there's no,

1571
01:18:46,380 --> 01:18:48,700
no possible,
reasonable hope for parole.

1572
01:18:48,850 --> 01:18:52,150
The idea of keeping someone to jail and 
a jail to rot for the rest of their life

1573
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:54,100
is probably more subtle.
More cruel.

1574
01:18:54,101 --> 01:18:54,790
Exactly.
Yeah.

1575
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,330
It's just bizarre.
The idea that that's,

1576
01:18:57,350 --> 01:19:02,200
that's somehow or another humane is so 
crazy and a lot of them,

1577
01:19:02,201 --> 01:19:04,060
by the way,
solitary confinement,

1578
01:19:04,210 --> 01:19:07,210
which is probably one of the worst 
things that you could do to a person,

1579
01:19:07,370 --> 01:19:10,580
especially a social,
a social analyst person.

1580
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:15,750
People were weird.
We need to be connected so much and one 

1581
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:19,321
of the worst punishments you could do it
just leave us alone while we're in 

1582
01:19:19,321 --> 01:19:20,260
prison,
surrounded by murderers,

1583
01:19:20,261 --> 01:19:21,460
rapists,
thieves,

1584
01:19:21,461 --> 01:19:23,260
thugs,
drug dealers.

1585
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:26,050
The worst thing they can do is put you 
by yourself.

1586
01:19:26,230 --> 01:19:28,540
That's exactly right.
Amazed that there's a guy,

1587
01:19:28,541 --> 01:19:30,250
I don't remember his name,
a Harvard,

1588
01:19:30,270 --> 01:19:33,070
a professor who had studied,
uh,

1589
01:19:33,290 --> 01:19:35,570
you know,
what makes people healthy for,

1590
01:19:35,590 --> 01:19:38,740
for something like 60 years.
And I think the bottom line,

1591
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:43,510
if I'm paraphrasing him,
is that people need social relationships

1592
01:19:43,660 --> 01:19:46,660
to be healthy.
That's sort of the number one thing that

1593
01:19:46,870 --> 01:19:49,720
maintains your health,
psychological and physiological

1594
01:19:50,170 --> 01:19:52,340
and happy social relationships to 
exactly.

1595
01:19:52,350 --> 01:19:52,830
I mean,
I,

1596
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:57,860
everyone that I know that has these 
horrible relationships with either 

1597
01:19:57,860 --> 01:20:01,780
boyfriends and girlfriends or with their
parents or with their job or the like,

1598
01:20:01,830 --> 01:20:04,620
they seem to like carry those on like 
all the time.

1599
01:20:04,621 --> 01:20:06,930
It's like becomes almost a part of the 
norm of.

1600
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:08,070
But

1601
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:13,070
the people that I know that have healthy
relationships with their boyfriends and 

1602
01:20:13,070 --> 01:20:16,851
girlfriends or wives and husbands,
healthy relationships with their 

1603
01:20:16,851 --> 01:20:19,551
children,
healthy relationships with their 

1604
01:20:19,551 --> 01:20:19,551
friends,
those are the happiest people I know,

1605
01:20:19,551 --> 01:20:19,551
right?
Like you can't,

1606
01:20:19,551 --> 01:20:24,171
you could foster that and you can 
somehow or another j generate this sort 

1607
01:20:24,171 --> 01:20:27,300
of beautiful environment around the 
closest people to you.

1608
01:20:27,470 --> 01:20:29,490
You'll have a much better life.
It's just that simple.

1609
01:20:29,670 --> 01:20:34,670
And by the way,
evolutionary psychologists study all of 

1610
01:20:34,670 --> 01:20:34,670
these kinds of things,
uh,

1611
01:20:34,670 --> 01:20:38,360
you know,
why is it that we would jump into a 

1612
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:38,360
river to save two brothers or better 
yet,

1613
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:40,170
why would we jump into a river to save a
stranger?

1614
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:41,240
And,
and it,

1615
01:20:41,350 --> 01:20:46,350
it,
it boils down to the fact that it's tit 

1616
01:20:46,350 --> 01:20:46,350
for tat,
right?

1617
01:20:46,350 --> 01:20:47,880
It's what's called reciprocal altruism 
a.

1618
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:50,040
are you familiar with this?
So,

1619
01:20:50,390 --> 01:20:52,300
so someone will do that for you someday.

1620
01:20:52,460 --> 01:20:53,360
Exactly.
Yeah.

1621
01:20:53,530 --> 01:20:56,400
And so the idea that,
you know,

1622
01:20:56,460 --> 01:21:01,460
as you said that it's a real punishment 
that put people in confinement is borne 

1623
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:06,560
out by evolutionary theory.
My friend Rammi jumped into a river to 

1624
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:06,560
save a woman.
She,

1625
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,740
uh,
she was in a canoe canoe,

1626
01:21:07,741 --> 01:21:09,420
flipped over,
husband drowned.

1627
01:21:09,421 --> 01:21:13,590
The husband's body floated face first 
passed him and the woman was screaming,

1628
01:21:13,591 --> 01:21:18,591
help me,
and he saw he saw her in the river and 

1629
01:21:18,591 --> 01:21:22,041
he just dove in and he's lucky.
He's in incredible shape and he's an 

1630
01:21:22,041 --> 01:21:23,490
outdoorsman and he's there.
He's a very good athlete,

1631
01:21:23,491 --> 01:21:25,530
very good sweater.
He's got real good endurance.

1632
01:21:25,531 --> 01:21:29,850
So he got to death's door,
like literally on death's door,

1633
01:21:29,910 --> 01:21:31,190
thought it was over,
thought it,

1634
01:21:31,230 --> 01:21:36,230
he's not going to make it out of here,
like he just sacrificed his life trying 

1635
01:21:36,230 --> 01:21:37,950
to save this woman and then rescued,
or they figured out a way to shore.

1636
01:21:37,950 --> 01:21:41,280
But when he describes the feeling and 
the experience,

1637
01:21:41,750 --> 01:21:45,180
it was almost beyond his control.
It was like he saw this woman.

1638
01:21:45,370 --> 01:21:47,310
It was only him.
There was no one else there.

1639
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:51,300
He had to do it and just jumped in.
While there's this thing,

1640
01:21:51,690 --> 01:21:54,570
speaking of guys who are in the business
of doing heroic acts,

1641
01:21:54,571 --> 01:21:57,030
there's a,
you've heard of the fireman fantasy.

1642
01:21:57,031 --> 01:22:02,031
I mean that the fact that women find 
guys bought firemen to be very 

1643
01:22:02,031 --> 01:22:06,771
attractive and it actually turns out 
that there was a study that was done 

1644
01:22:06,771 --> 01:22:10,400
that actually shows us to be the case.
And I have discussed this in one of my 

1645
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:13,011
articles on psychology today.
If you have a guy approach women either 

1646
01:22:13,011 --> 01:22:14,160
wearing a fireman,
sooth or not,

1647
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:19,680
uh,
his chances of getting her phone number 

1648
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:21,150
increases quite substantially.
Really if he is wearing a fireman.

1649
01:22:21,151 --> 01:22:22,470
So how do they know this?

1650
01:22:22,650 --> 01:22:27,650
Did they do a study guide?
Where do they have the same guy?

1651
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:31,380
Not where the firemen with the same 
approach and the same.

1652
01:22:31,410 --> 01:22:32,780
Same word,
same scripts,

1653
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:34,410
same everything.
One version.

1654
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:36,910
It's called the field experiment.
In one version you,

1655
01:22:36,940 --> 01:22:40,310
you approach women at a cafe wearing the
stuff and another version you don't.

1656
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:44,040
The Guy who actually did that research 
is a French psychologist.

1657
01:22:44,041 --> 01:22:49,041
His name is Nicola Guy and I've actually
covered a few of his studies on my 

1658
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:54,680
website,
my most read article ever over maybe 

1659
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:55,710
three,
400,000

1660
01:22:55,711 --> 01:23:00,711
readers as is one of his studies where I
was sympathetic because we're going to 

1661
01:23:00,751 --> 01:23:03,060
talk about the blowback issue now here 
again,

1662
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:06,040
it was a study where he looked at the 
likelihood

1663
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:11,070
of women being picked up as hitchhikers 
as a function of their breast size.

1664
01:23:12,430 --> 01:23:17,430
So he actually had the same woman and 
they artificially manipulated her breast

1665
01:23:18,191 --> 01:23:21,220
size and on different days she would 
stand there.

1666
01:23:21,221 --> 01:23:26,221
And and of course it turned out that men
were much more likely to pick up the 

1667
01:23:26,221 --> 01:23:28,120
woman if she had the same woman that she
had bigger breast side.

1668
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:31,300
So I just summarize that study,
put it up,

1669
01:23:31,390 --> 01:23:33,190
and then I remember I had gone on 
vacation,

1670
01:23:33,850 --> 01:23:36,700
came back from vacation father that I 
had to completely gone viral,

1671
01:23:37,030 --> 01:23:41,410
but I had a million hate mail,
not just from readers,

1672
01:23:41,710 --> 01:23:46,710
but from fellow psychologists that they 
bloggers who were arguing that I was 

1673
01:23:47,140 --> 01:23:52,140
peddling pornography because I had a 
picture as the teaser image for that 

1674
01:23:52,140 --> 01:23:56,071
article.
I had a photo of a woman sitting in a 

1675
01:23:56,071 --> 01:23:56,071
passenger seat,
would big wood,

1676
01:23:56,071 --> 01:23:56,830
large breasts.
Well,

1677
01:23:56,831 --> 01:24:01,831
it seemed appropriate for the topic 
given that that's what the topic of the 

1678
01:24:01,831 --> 01:24:05,011
study was.
But by putting that image I was 

1679
01:24:05,011 --> 01:24:06,820
objectifying women.
I was treating them as sex objects.

1680
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:12,000
And so even though I had nothing to do 
with the study and I was simply 

1681
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,791
summarizing somebody else's work,
I was a horrifying pornographic 

1682
01:24:15,010 --> 01:24:15,370
pedaling.

1683
01:24:15,470 --> 01:24:19,070
Isn't it funny that just a photograph of
a woman with large breasts is considered

1684
01:24:19,071 --> 01:24:19,790
pornographic

1685
01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:20,480
right?
Now,

1686
01:24:20,481 --> 01:24:25,481
listen to this.
So then I've also written articles on 

1687
01:24:25,481 --> 01:24:26,690
psychology today where I talk about all 
kinds of issues dealing with penis size.

1688
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:32,000
You know,
so do women want a guy with a bigger 

1689
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:32,000
penis?
Are they more likely to have orgasms?

1690
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:32,280
She's got a bigger penis.
Uh,

1691
01:24:32,780 --> 01:24:35,310
if you're in a gay relationship,
man,

1692
01:24:35,340 --> 01:24:40,340
man,
are you likely to be top or bottom as a 

1693
01:24:40,340 --> 01:24:42,770
function of your penis size?
That study has been done by science,

1694
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:47,930
and so for those articles I put sexy 
images of men.

1695
01:24:48,470 --> 01:24:52,730
So then I wrote to each of those people 
who had written the hate man.

1696
01:24:52,731 --> 01:24:53,570
I said,
well,

1697
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:57,650
in all fairness,
you now have to write an equally hateful

1698
01:24:57,651 --> 01:25:01,370
thing because I'm also sexually 
exploiting men's bodies.

1699
01:25:01,610 --> 01:25:03,500
Of course they went away and never came 
back.

1700
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:05,560
Yeah,
well,

1701
01:25:05,561 --> 01:25:10,150
the idea being that women are more 
oppressed than men are not equal,

1702
01:25:10,151 --> 01:25:13,360
but it is equal.
It's very tricky,

1703
01:25:13,361 --> 01:25:18,361
but the idea that a woman with big 
breasts sitting there and I passed her 

1704
01:25:18,361 --> 01:25:21,271
seat of a car,
could somehow or another be 

1705
01:25:21,271 --> 01:25:21,271
pornographic.
It was ridiculous.

1706
01:25:21,271 --> 01:25:21,271
Yeah.
Women have big breasts,

1707
01:25:21,271 --> 01:25:23,320
so some of them they exists.
I'm in a big penises.

1708
01:25:23,590 --> 01:25:25,150
It all.
It's all real stuff.

1709
01:25:25,390 --> 01:25:28,840
Some people have two eyes and noses.
Interestingly,

1710
01:25:28,841 --> 01:25:29,320
some of the

1711
01:25:29,550 --> 01:25:31,970
college,
these are psychologists were saying,

1712
01:25:32,270 --> 01:25:34,790
why do you write about these issues of 
sexuality?

1713
01:25:34,791 --> 01:25:36,740
What does that have to do with 
psychology?

1714
01:25:36,860 --> 01:25:41,860
Why are you so,
so that psychologists could actually 

1715
01:25:41,860 --> 01:25:45,971
argue that issues dealing with sexuality
were outside the purview of psychology.

1716
01:25:46,910 --> 01:25:47,150
That's.

1717
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:48,870
Well,
it's stupid.

1718
01:25:48,990 --> 01:25:53,990
It's really,
it's scary stupid because it's denying 

1719
01:25:53,990 --> 01:25:55,950
reality in order to fit with your 
ideology.

1720
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:58,830
This ideology of politically correct 
thinking.

1721
01:25:58,831 --> 01:26:01,170
And I don't like the term politically 
correct.

1722
01:26:01,530 --> 01:26:04,610
I don't like it because it's been sort 
of overrun

1723
01:26:04,610 --> 01:26:07,580
and overused and it's kind of like,
it's a beaten term,

1724
01:26:07,610 --> 01:26:08,360
right?
You know,

1725
01:26:08,361 --> 01:26:11,990
but it's the appropriate one just to 
convey the idea.

1726
01:26:12,030 --> 01:26:14,470
Right.
But it's just,

1727
01:26:14,510 --> 01:26:17,570
it's so prevalent,
it's so prevalent and that the fact that

1728
01:26:17,571 --> 01:26:20,960
it's so prevalent amongst academics is 
really disturbing to me.

1729
01:26:21,170 --> 01:26:22,370
Yeah.
I'm with you,

1730
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:23,690
you know,
have you had,

1731
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:26,670
have you had many other academics on the
show quite a bit.

1732
01:26:27,380 --> 01:26:32,380
What's,
how are they like in terms of their 

1733
01:26:32,380 --> 01:26:32,380
general positions?
Um,

1734
01:26:32,380 --> 01:26:32,380
well,
many,

1735
01:26:32,380 --> 01:26:34,460
many of them share your points of view.
Oh really?

1736
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:39,720
Luckily.
Now is it just that you happen to 

1737
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:42,790
gravitate towards guys that you would 
think that already would sort of not be 

1738
01:26:42,790 --> 01:26:43,490
these little wimpy guys or,
or.

1739
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:48,800
I mean,
how come it turns out that they're all 

1740
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:48,800
sharing because we're certainly in the 
minority in academia,

1741
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,270
so those are the only ones I'm 
interested in.

1742
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:51,660
I guess.
I mean,

1743
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:56,680
I'm actually quite fascinating talk.
I would love to talk to some male 

1744
01:26:56,680 --> 01:26:59,870
feminist who shares these Islamic phobic
hating ideas,

1745
01:26:59,871 --> 01:27:02,960
like hating Islamophobia,
and I'll send you,

1746
01:27:02,961 --> 01:27:06,200
I'll send you some names.
What the problem is,

1747
01:27:06,201 --> 01:27:11,201
you know,
it would get ugly somewhere along the 

1748
01:27:11,201 --> 01:27:11,201
line,
right?

1749
01:27:11,201 --> 01:27:13,810
You know,
I'm sure one of us would resort to 

1750
01:27:13,810 --> 01:27:13,810
insults not.
I wouldn't be.

1751
01:27:13,940 --> 01:27:17,690
I wouldn't put.
I am utterly fascinated by ideology,

1752
01:27:18,470 --> 01:27:21,020
ideologies that I support or do not 
support,

1753
01:27:21,290 --> 01:27:22,070
you know,
all of them.

1754
01:27:22,071 --> 01:27:22,910
I mean,
I mean,

1755
01:27:22,911 --> 01:27:23,240
I,
I,

1756
01:27:23,241 --> 01:27:27,140
I'm fascinated by the Dalai Lama.
I'm fascinated by how many people take a

1757
01:27:27,141 --> 01:27:29,120
guy who only wears orange robe.
Seriously.

1758
01:27:29,690 --> 01:27:34,690
Come on.
Do you really think God gives a fuck 

1759
01:27:34,690 --> 01:27:34,690
what clothes you wear?
Is He,

1760
01:27:34,690 --> 01:27:37,220
is he staying warm in that or is he.
He's no different than that fucking Phil

1761
01:27:37,220 --> 01:27:38,560
Robertson Guy.
That's from duck dynasty.

1762
01:27:38,580 --> 01:27:43,580
Always worse.
Cammo was wearing a God damn outfit and 

1763
01:27:43,580 --> 01:27:43,580
buy that outfit.
You recognize that he,

1764
01:27:43,580 --> 01:27:48,341
oh,
he's a man of peace and of enlightened 

1765
01:27:48,341 --> 01:27:48,341
thinking.
No,

1766
01:27:48,341 --> 01:27:49,550
he's a silly man who wears orange,
doesn't have sex.

1767
01:27:49,670 --> 01:27:51,470
Okay.
And why does he not have sex?

1768
01:27:51,471 --> 01:27:53,450
Because he has an ideology,
right?

1769
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:57,200
This ideology tells him that he's a holy
man from birth.

1770
01:27:57,580 --> 01:28:02,580
And if you don't think that's fucking 
ridiculous because he's friends with 

1771
01:28:02,580 --> 01:28:02,580
Sharon stone.
You and I have nothing to talk about.

1772
01:28:02,890 --> 01:28:03,310
Oh,
he's,

1773
01:28:03,420 --> 01:28:05,590
he's buddies with Richard Gere.
He must be holy.

1774
01:28:05,870 --> 01:28:07,320
You get the fuck Outta here,
man.

1775
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:12,400
You know,
it's funny you talk about these 

1776
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:13,991
Hollywood types.
I wrote an article which one of those 

1777
01:28:13,991 --> 01:28:17,291
really popular ones on psychology today 
when I was talking about the narcissism 

1778
01:28:17,291 --> 01:28:19,980
and grandiosity of celebrities were,
uh,

1779
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:21,000
they,
they,

1780
01:28:21,230 --> 01:28:24,950
uh,
what's her madonna because of her cabala

1781
01:28:24,951 --> 01:28:26,180
juice,
uh,

1782
01:28:26,210 --> 01:28:27,570
says that,
uh,

1783
01:28:27,590 --> 01:28:32,590
the radiation problem and some lake in 
Ukraine could be resolved by putting 

1784
01:28:32,590 --> 01:28:34,020
some cabala juice on it.
And she's really,

1785
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:36,500
she's really astounding.
Come on,

1786
01:28:36,510 --> 01:28:40,180
wait a minute.
Kabbalah Kabbalah.

1787
01:28:40,190 --> 01:28:41,560
Holy Water.
I don't know anyone.

1788
01:28:41,620 --> 01:28:44,390
I don't want to help her in any way by 
bringing this up.

1789
01:28:44,430 --> 01:28:44,730
And,
you know,

1790
01:28:45,090 --> 01:28:48,020
when Paul had some other thing about 
beauty,

1791
01:28:48,290 --> 01:28:49,450
uh,
the,

1792
01:28:49,470 --> 01:28:50,210
the,
um,

1793
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:51,070
the,
the,

1794
01:28:51,220 --> 01:28:52,600
the autism girl,
everything.

1795
01:28:53,210 --> 01:28:53,900
Oh,
Jenny McCarthy,

1796
01:28:53,901 --> 01:28:57,090
Jenny McCarthy,
the autism was,

1797
01:28:57,500 --> 01:29:02,010
was shocked that the NIH,
the Institute of Health was

1798
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:06,420
not taking her scientific research 
seriously demonstrating that that's what

1799
01:29:06,910 --> 01:29:09,590
she has.
Scientists know she does research.

1800
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:14,720
She,
I think she must've played once at some 

1801
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:14,720
point.
No,

1802
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:14,970
but seriously,
what I argue there is that,

1803
01:29:15,710 --> 01:29:16,780
uh,
you know,

1804
01:29:16,860 --> 01:29:21,860
if you're,
if you're walking all day with yes men 

1805
01:29:21,860 --> 01:29:26,600
catering to each of your whims,
you actually live in a world where you 

1806
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:27,570
truly start thinking that you're data.
I mean,

1807
01:29:27,571 --> 01:29:32,571
you really did save the world.
I'm Tom Cruise and I saved the world in 

1808
01:29:32,571 --> 01:29:32,571
mission impossible,
whatever,

1809
01:29:32,571 --> 01:29:37,010
and therefore it is perfectly reasonable
that I have something profound to say 

1810
01:29:37,010 --> 01:29:41,661
about everything right there for Tom 
Cruise says that there is no such thing 

1811
01:29:41,661 --> 01:29:44,010
as psych,
psychiatric instant illnesses.

1812
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:49,160
You just have to do exercise and 
vitamins and that we don't take that 

1813
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:52,911
seriously is really an affront to him.
And so I had written an article where I 

1814
01:29:52,911 --> 01:29:57,111
was saying that it's,
it's really astounding the type of 

1815
01:29:57,111 --> 01:29:58,830
narcissism that these folks and I argued
that it is part,

1816
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:03,860
it comes from a form of guilt that deep 
in the recesses of their bedrooms,

1817
01:30:04,741 --> 01:30:08,250
when they turn off the lights,
many of them actually know that they are

1818
01:30:08,251 --> 01:30:12,360
frauds that are not really deserving of 
all of the perks that they've received.

1819
01:30:12,660 --> 01:30:17,660
And so one of the ways that maybe I 
could fix that is by demonstrating that 

1820
01:30:17,660 --> 01:30:20,370
I am much more than a mere actor.
I'm really helping in Darfur.

1821
01:30:20,371 --> 01:30:25,371
I'm really helping solve the radiation 
problem in the Ukraine and so on and so 

1822
01:30:25,371 --> 01:30:28,020
forth.
Because then I seem as though maybe I am

1823
01:30:28,021 --> 01:30:31,020
more worthy of all the accolades that 
are being bestowed upon me.

1824
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:33,500
That's a very fascinating way of looking
at it.

1825
01:30:33,530 --> 01:30:35,440
I think you probably are onto something 
there.

1826
01:30:35,650 --> 01:30:40,120
I think the knowledge and the 
understanding that they're frauds,

1827
01:30:40,900 --> 01:30:45,900
the deep seated knowledge,
whether they avoid it and deny it or 

1828
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:49,441
not.
I there's a lot of people that are 

1829
01:30:49,441 --> 01:30:52,051
horrible people that are involved in 
charitable organizations and one of the 

1830
01:30:52,051 --> 01:30:54,970
reasons being is to church sort of show 
that they are good people.

1831
01:30:55,420 --> 01:31:00,420
There's a guy who's a pretty blatant 
plagiarist who's involved in some pretty

1832
01:31:01,990 --> 01:31:04,060
interesting charities for good 
charities,

1833
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:09,120
very good charities,
but I had a conversation with someone 

1834
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:09,340
about it and they were talking about,
hey,

1835
01:31:09,341 --> 01:31:14,341
you know what?
He does so much good for this 

1836
01:31:14,341 --> 01:31:14,341
organization.
I don't.

1837
01:31:14,341 --> 01:31:14,341
I don't care.
I go,

1838
01:31:14,341 --> 01:31:16,000
do you understand that?
That's probably why he does that.

1839
01:31:16,220 --> 01:31:19,990
Like the guy's a complete sociopath.
He's fucked over his friends.

1840
01:31:19,991 --> 01:31:23,530
You stolen their work and pass it off as
his own.

1841
01:31:23,700 --> 01:31:27,100
Yet he supports firefighters.
Do you not understand that that's what's

1842
01:31:27,101 --> 01:31:27,970
going on there?
I mean,

1843
01:31:27,971 --> 01:31:32,971
he's pretty obvious.
If you listen to him talk for any long 

1844
01:31:32,971 --> 01:31:32,971
period of time,
there's something wrong.

1845
01:31:32,971 --> 01:31:37,950
There's like some some connections 
inside the mind that are not being made 

1846
01:31:37,950 --> 01:31:40,240
and he's had a strategy and a strategy 
to avoid criticism is to show charitable

1847
01:31:40,241 --> 01:31:41,830
work.
Like Lance Armstrong,

1848
01:31:41,980 --> 01:31:44,230
whenever he was confronted about his 
drug use,

1849
01:31:44,231 --> 01:31:46,360
would always talk about how much he's 
doing for cancer,

1850
01:31:46,630 --> 01:31:48,820
for cancer research.
That was this whole thing,

1851
01:31:48,940 --> 01:31:52,690
despite the fact that he'd sued people 
that had claimed that they,

1852
01:31:52,930 --> 01:31:55,810
their lives had been affected by his 
drug use,

1853
01:31:56,050 --> 01:32:00,190
that they,
the people that they love had been

1854
01:32:00,460 --> 01:32:02,530
drug tested and that they,
you know,

1855
01:32:02,531 --> 01:32:07,531
they lost their whole entire career and 
that they were aligned with Lance 

1856
01:32:07,531 --> 01:32:08,230
Armstrong did drugs with Lance 
Armstrong,

1857
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:10,690
Lance Armstrong would sue these people,
you know,

1858
01:32:10,691 --> 01:32:15,691
you're in La.
And then finally came out and told the 

1859
01:32:15,691 --> 01:32:17,581
truth and you know,
passed off as organization to other 

1860
01:32:17,581 --> 01:32:20,761
people.
Now he's a fucking broken man and 

1861
01:32:20,761 --> 01:32:20,770
rightly so because he's a God damn 
sociopath.

1862
01:32:21,130 --> 01:32:26,130
But that this instance or this 
insistence rather of being a part of a 

1863
01:32:26,130 --> 01:32:27,790
charitable organization and being the 
figurehead,

1864
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:30,350
not just silently like I don't,
I,

1865
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:34,960
I'm a big fan of not talking about 
charities that I contribute to.

1866
01:32:34,961 --> 01:32:37,570
I don't like to.
Because I think there's something sneaky

1867
01:32:37,810 --> 01:32:39,480
about.
It's almost like it,

1868
01:32:40,390 --> 01:32:42,190
like if you give a thousand dollars to a
charity,

1869
01:32:42,191 --> 01:32:43,660
but then you let everybody know,
hey,

1870
01:32:43,661 --> 01:32:45,460
I just get a thousand dollars to a 
charity.

1871
01:32:45,490 --> 01:32:46,780
I talk about that in my books.

1872
01:32:46,940 --> 01:32:48,880
Yeah.
So there's something there.

1873
01:32:49,090 --> 01:32:51,340
You know what my money.
This is an old philosophy,

1874
01:32:51,370 --> 01:32:53,180
Jewish philosopher from the twelfth 
century.

1875
01:32:53,181 --> 01:32:58,181
He's very,
very important guy in Jewish moral 

1876
01:32:58,181 --> 01:33:00,781
philosophy at.
He talked about eight levels of said 

1877
01:33:00,781 --> 01:33:03,000
that cuts is charity giving.
Uh,

1878
01:33:03,220 --> 01:33:08,220
in terms of the purity of the act,
the most pure form of Tzedakah is where 

1879
01:33:08,501 --> 01:33:13,501
the altruist and the recipient of the 
altruism don't know of one another 

1880
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:18,720
because,
and he said this a thousand years ago 

1881
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:18,890
where he had no evolutionary attorney,
but I then I then package it as,

1882
01:33:18,910 --> 01:33:23,910
as an evolutionary argument because 
there's great social signaling rewards 

1883
01:33:23,910 --> 01:33:27,340
that come from you writing the Joe Rogan
cancer ward,

1884
01:33:27,380 --> 01:33:28,720
right?
Right.

1885
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:34,500
If you are in,
why do the upper uppers don't drive 

1886
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:37,330
maseratis because everybody in their 
circle can also buy a Maserati.

1887
01:33:37,420 --> 01:33:42,420
So they actually drive pretty oftentime,
pretty cheapest cars because that's not 

1888
01:33:42,420 --> 01:33:47,161
going to be a very honest signal of my 
true value because everybody in my 

1889
01:33:47,161 --> 01:33:48,890
social group can imitate it,
but if I can give $100,

1890
01:33:48,891 --> 01:33:52,350
million dollars to the soul and so 
cancer or buy a $100,

1891
01:33:52,351 --> 01:33:54,420
million dollar painting that a two year 
old could,

1892
01:33:54,460 --> 01:33:55,720
could have otherwise painted.

1893
01:33:56,020 --> 01:33:57,880
Boy,
that's an honest signal of my quality.

1894
01:33:57,881 --> 01:34:02,881
Right.
And so I actually talk about this exact 

1895
01:34:02,881 --> 01:34:04,690
idea of,
of not advertising your generosity.

1896
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:06,700
Yeah.
I call it happiness bombs.

1897
01:34:06,701 --> 01:34:11,701
When I leave a big tip at a restaurant,
I get out of there before the waiter 

1898
01:34:11,701 --> 01:34:12,310
could see what the Ta is nice.
I like to do that.

1899
01:34:12,370 --> 01:34:14,950
I like to leave big tips and then run 
the fuck out of there.

1900
01:34:14,951 --> 01:34:19,951
I don't want to see that person.
I say thank you to them on the way out 

1901
01:34:19,951 --> 01:34:19,951
the door,
but I don't want to see the tip and then

1902
01:34:19,951 --> 01:34:22,340
thank me back because it almost like,
you know,

1903
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:23,560
it takes away from it.
It's like,

1904
01:34:23,860 --> 01:34:28,860
like I said,
if someone donates a thousand dollars 

1905
01:34:28,860 --> 01:34:28,860
but then tells the world they do a 
$1,000,

1906
01:34:28,860 --> 01:34:29,830
I think you owe another thousand 
dollars,

1907
01:34:30,270 --> 01:34:32,230
you'll,
you'll always silent thousand.

1908
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:33,680
Do you know the,
you know,

1909
01:34:33,770 --> 01:34:35,350
you must know the show curb your 
enthusiasm.

1910
01:34:35,350 --> 01:34:37,790
Yes.
So there's an episode on Tuesday,

1911
01:34:37,830 --> 01:34:42,830
Asm,
where Larry David is at some function 

1912
01:34:42,830 --> 01:34:46,690
with Ted Danson.
They both gave anonymous donations,

1913
01:34:46,870 --> 01:34:49,930
but everybody keeps walking up to that 
dance and telling you,

1914
01:34:49,980 --> 01:34:51,790
oh,
congratulations on this donation.

1915
01:34:51,791 --> 01:34:53,800
That was so generous of you.
So Larry,

1916
01:34:53,801 --> 01:34:55,840
David go.
David goes crazy because he goes,

1917
01:34:55,990 --> 01:34:56,890
that's bullshit,
man.

1918
01:34:56,891 --> 01:34:59,150
You're from this whole thing.
It's not anonymous.

1919
01:34:59,151 --> 01:35:01,430
Nobody knows that.
It's exactly what we were talking about.

1920
01:35:01,431 --> 01:35:06,431
Right?
So that whole episode was a great 

1921
01:35:06,431 --> 01:35:07,910
episode because whoever wrote it 
actually understands our human nature.

1922
01:35:08,210 --> 01:35:09,650
Yeah.
It's a fascinating,

1923
01:35:09,651 --> 01:35:12,070
fascinating aspect of human beings.
This,

1924
01:35:12,071 --> 01:35:14,770
this need to be considered altruistic.
Yes.

1925
01:35:14,780 --> 01:35:19,780
Need to be considered benevolent.
You know the to to advertise it instead 

1926
01:35:19,780 --> 01:35:24,431
of just being,
you know that you can't exist in the 

1927
01:35:24,431 --> 01:35:27,140
silence of the personal satisfaction of 
contributing and giving,

1928
01:35:27,141 --> 01:35:31,100
giving out love and generosity that you 
have to be rewarded for it.

1929
01:35:31,130 --> 01:35:36,130
Well,
I have a section in my first book which 

1930
01:35:36,130 --> 01:35:36,130
I titled Philanthropy as a costly 
signal,

1931
01:35:36,710 --> 01:35:41,710
constantly signaling and biology.
So the Peacock's tail is a constantly 

1932
01:35:41,710 --> 01:35:45,491
signal because it actually serves as a 
really honest signal of my worth for me 

1933
01:35:45,861 --> 01:35:48,980
to carry this burden,
tail and avoid predators.

1934
01:35:49,250 --> 01:35:54,250
Then you really should take me seriously
all you female hands because here I am 

1935
01:35:54,250 --> 01:35:57,761
here and I've survived.
So that's called an honest signal or a 

1936
01:35:57,761 --> 01:35:57,761
costly sigma.
Well,

1937
01:35:57,761 --> 01:36:00,650
philanthropy I argue in many cases is 
that us on a signal?

1938
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:02,270
Precisely for the reasons that we're 
talking about.

1939
01:36:02,271 --> 01:36:07,271
So I am fascinated by peacocks.
I'm fascinated by black guys who go to 

1940
01:36:07,271 --> 01:36:09,980
clubs with $100,000
worth of jewelry on them.

1941
01:36:10,460 --> 01:36:11,050
You know,
I,

1942
01:36:11,060 --> 01:36:12,530
I,
it's amazing that,

1943
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:14,870
that aspect of,
especially the rap community.

1944
01:36:14,871 --> 01:36:15,200
Well,
you know,

1945
01:36:15,201 --> 01:36:15,610
the,
the,

1946
01:36:15,620 --> 01:36:17,700
the throwing the money and all the 
videos.

1947
01:36:17,770 --> 01:36:20,600
I'm making sure I got an article on 
that,

1948
01:36:20,601 --> 01:36:23,090
man.
Did you ever think that you would have a

1949
01:36:23,091 --> 01:36:27,140
scientist on your show talking about the
evolutionary roots of making it rain?

1950
01:36:27,310 --> 01:36:29,600
Oh No.
I'm so happy to be talking to you now.

1951
01:36:29,610 --> 01:36:31,640
I was happy to talk to you already,
but now more so,

1952
01:36:31,910 --> 01:36:32,860
um,
what is,

1953
01:36:33,230 --> 01:36:34,930
what is that like the,
the,

1954
01:36:34,931 --> 01:36:36,800
the,
the diamonds and the gold chains.

1955
01:36:36,801 --> 01:36:41,801
And then why is it specifically 
connected to the African American 

1956
01:36:41,801 --> 01:36:43,450
community as opposed to you?
I mean,

1957
01:36:43,700 --> 01:36:46,840
the Italian American community was 
always gold chains a little bit,

1958
01:36:46,850 --> 01:36:51,850
but not as much diamonds and mean black 
people took it to a totally new level.

1959
01:36:52,220 --> 01:36:53,090
Right?
I,

1960
01:36:53,110 --> 01:36:58,110
I can't speak to why one culture,
the sides to use one particular form of 

1961
01:36:58,110 --> 01:37:00,710
status.
If you're the mass tribe in Africa,

1962
01:37:00,980 --> 01:37:03,320
it might be the number of cattle heads 
that you have.

1963
01:37:03,350 --> 01:37:04,870
That is the peacocking,
right?

1964
01:37:05,270 --> 01:37:10,270
So what we do know is that different 
cultures will use different forms of 

1965
01:37:10,270 --> 01:37:14,501
peacocking,
but in all cultures it is going to be 

1966
01:37:14,501 --> 01:37:15,110
the males in that culture who engage in 
the act.

1967
01:37:15,170 --> 01:37:20,170
That's the universal,
the peacock in the African American 

1968
01:37:20,170 --> 01:37:23,471
community is most fascinating because a 
lot of these rappers come from these 

1969
01:37:23,471 --> 01:37:25,730
very poor neighborhoods,
so they're dealing with a lot of poverty

1970
01:37:25,731 --> 01:37:29,990
and crime and as they're growing up,
and then as they get older,

1971
01:37:30,170 --> 01:37:35,170
their identities,
once they become connected to success 

1972
01:37:35,170 --> 01:37:38,060
are also connected to firearms and and 
diamonds.

1973
01:37:38,660 --> 01:37:43,660
Specifically diamonds.
They're all day blinged out everything 

1974
01:37:43,660 --> 01:37:43,660
out teeth.
Yeah.

1975
01:37:44,030 --> 01:37:46,760
How crazy is that?
You're walking around with 100,000

1976
01:37:46,761 --> 01:37:50,090
dollars with a dental appliances.
I mean probably more.

1977
01:37:50,091 --> 01:37:51,910
I don't understand diamonds,
so I don't.

1978
01:37:51,911 --> 01:37:54,320
I don't own any diamonds,
so when I say 100,000

1979
01:37:54,321 --> 01:37:55,010
dollars,
I don't.

1980
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:57,990
I might be way off.
There was a company called,

1981
01:37:58,710 --> 01:37:59,730
I don't remember the name of the 
company,

1982
01:37:59,731 --> 01:38:02,580
but the project was called American 
brand stand.

1983
01:38:02,940 --> 01:38:07,680
A play on American bandstand.
Dick Clark,

1984
01:38:07,681 --> 01:38:10,260
they collect a.
So what they did is they did they,

1985
01:38:10,300 --> 01:38:15,300
they looked,
they did a content analysis of brand 

1986
01:38:15,300 --> 01:38:18,951
mentions in billboard top 100 to see how
often brands are mentioned.

1987
01:38:20,710 --> 01:38:22,170
Hey girl,
I've got the Maserati.

1988
01:38:22,470 --> 01:38:24,750
And what they found,
not surprisingly,

1989
01:38:24,990 --> 01:38:28,050
is that it's almost exclusively in hip 
hop videos.

1990
01:38:28,270 --> 01:38:31,890
It's almost exclusively male rappers who
do this behavior.

1991
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:33,750
And it wasn't diamonds,
actually,

1992
01:38:33,751 --> 01:38:35,670
what the number one product was,
cars.

1993
01:38:36,420 --> 01:38:41,420
So cars were overwhelmingly the most 
often cited form of peacocking in rap 

1994
01:38:43,891 --> 01:38:44,910
video,
in rap songs.

1995
01:38:45,030 --> 01:38:46,130
I was at a,
uh,

1996
01:38:46,140 --> 01:38:48,240
an event,
a kickboxing event in Los Angeles.

1997
01:38:48,270 --> 01:38:49,770
All my friends,
Eddie and tate,

1998
01:38:49,771 --> 01:38:50,340
and we,
uh,

1999
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:51,660
we,
we showed up.

2000
01:38:51,661 --> 01:38:55,020
This guy pulled up in this bright orange
Lamborghini,

2001
01:38:55,021 --> 01:38:58,890
this crazy car with a gold wing doors 
that pop up.

2002
01:38:59,370 --> 01:39:00,630
And uh,
I,

2003
01:39:01,010 --> 01:39:03,060
we were talking and I'm a fan of cars.

2004
01:39:03,060 --> 01:39:05,910
I love cars,
but I do not like lamborghinis.

2005
01:39:05,911 --> 01:39:09,030
I think they're foolish.
I think the doors are foolish.

2006
01:39:09,031 --> 01:39:14,031
I mean they break all the time.
I have a friend who reviews cars and he 

2007
01:39:14,031 --> 01:39:18,380
reviewed this Lamborghini aventador and 
he said it broke down after like two 

2008
01:39:18,380 --> 01:39:18,420
days ahead of,
for two days.

2009
01:39:18,421 --> 01:39:23,421
And the transmission exploded.
And I was laughing about it and I was 

2010
01:39:23,421 --> 01:39:23,421
like,
what the fuck?

2011
01:39:23,421 --> 01:39:25,350
Like why would you spend a half a 
million dollars on that car?

2012
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:28,590
Like there's some brilliant pieces of.
I'm a big fan of cars.

2013
01:39:28,591 --> 01:39:32,910
I'm a big fan of engineering in general.
I love well engineered watches.

2014
01:39:32,911 --> 01:39:36,750
I love a well engineered table.
I love lapped fastened.

2015
01:39:37,020 --> 01:39:42,020
I'm fascinated by human innovation.
So when I see certain cars I am 

2016
01:39:42,020 --> 01:39:43,380
fascinated by them,
but when I see that one,

2017
01:39:43,381 --> 01:39:46,080
I just think that's just so goofy and my
friends were like,

2018
01:39:46,150 --> 01:39:48,520
Bro,
that car gets you posted.

2019
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:50,080
And I was like,
really?

2020
01:39:50,081 --> 01:39:52,590
He doesn't really like come on man is a 
girl.

2021
01:39:52,650 --> 01:39:55,080
What a girl bank.
So we had this debate with a girl,

2022
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:57,540
have sex with you.
She saw you in that car.

2023
01:39:57,570 --> 01:40:02,570
Let me answer that.
As opposed to please do as opposed to 

2024
01:40:02,570 --> 01:40:02,700
let's say a corvette and like,
Nah man,

2025
01:40:02,701 --> 01:40:05,220
anybody can get a corvette.
The corvette is like,

2026
01:40:05,221 --> 01:40:06,270
my friend goes,
man,

2027
01:40:06,390 --> 01:40:08,460
a girl will hop in your car just to see 
where you live.

2028
01:40:08,461 --> 01:40:10,620
If you have that car,
they just want to see what your house.

2029
01:40:10,730 --> 01:40:12,210
You've got a $500,000
car.

2030
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:14,560
What the fuck does that do to the house?
Look like south?

2031
01:40:14,590 --> 01:40:17,820
Tell you three scientific studies,
one of which is mine,

2032
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:20,790
and then a personal story of my brother 
who lives in southern California.

2033
01:40:21,220 --> 01:40:21,960
Uh,
so Nico,

2034
01:40:21,970 --> 01:40:24,270
I get down to the guy who did the breast
and French guy,

2035
01:40:24,271 --> 01:40:29,271
a French guy that did a study,
a very much similar in spirit where 

2036
01:40:29,271 --> 01:40:31,080
instead of manipulating the firemen 
sooth,

2037
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:36,320
he had the same guy approach different 
women as a function of an manipulated 

2038
01:40:36,361 --> 01:40:38,940
which car he was driving.
I can't remember the exact details,

2039
01:40:38,941 --> 01:40:43,941
but something like a three time increase
and the likelihood of a woman giving you

2040
01:40:43,981 --> 01:40:48,981
her phone number if you are driving high
status car versus a little status car 

2041
01:40:48,981 --> 01:40:50,550
that's exactly three times three times 
greater.

2042
01:40:50,710 --> 01:40:52,560
Wow.
And the same guy by the way,

2043
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:53,860
that another study

2044
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:56,520
where he.
Yah,

2045
01:40:56,590 --> 01:41:01,590
he was either he made the guy who was 
approaching the woman was either with a 

2046
01:41:01,590 --> 01:41:05,610
baby or not,
and another version with a dog or not 

2047
01:41:05,610 --> 01:41:09,900
having a dog increases digits uptake,
invention and have interacting with the 

2048
01:41:11,351 --> 01:41:16,351
baby also increases.
So I joke that you should be driving a 

2049
01:41:16,351 --> 01:41:21,030
Lamborghini while having a dog next to 
you and it baby while wearing a 

2050
01:41:21,030 --> 01:41:24,730
fireman's suit.
You're going to get all the ladies in 

2051
01:41:24,730 --> 01:41:29,140
Orange County and in Newport beach,
so that's one and another study,

2052
01:41:29,141 --> 01:41:32,290
and then I'm going to come to my study 
in the second and another study,

2053
01:41:32,291 --> 01:41:35,410
not by this guy.
They took the same men,

2054
01:41:35,740 --> 01:41:38,860
put them either in a Bentley or in a 
whatever,

2055
01:41:38,861 --> 01:41:43,861
Ford Fiesta and did the same thing with 
the same with a wound and then it those 

2056
01:41:43,861 --> 01:41:48,810
opposite sex rating so the women would 
rate the two guys and the same guy when 

2057
01:41:49,331 --> 01:41:54,331
he is in the Bentley,
was viewed as astonishingly more 

2058
01:41:54,331 --> 01:41:55,810
handsome.
Which of course objectives can be.

2059
01:41:55,811 --> 01:41:58,750
I mean you have your physiology.
If your physical traits don't change,

2060
01:41:59,050 --> 01:42:01,870
but there was a glow effect from the car
that he's driving.

2061
01:42:02,140 --> 01:42:03,470
He's handsome,
he's,

2062
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:06,670
he's a Brad Pitt and this car.
He's a loser in this other car,

2063
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:10,030
but the same manipulation on women.
Men didn't care.

2064
01:42:10,060 --> 01:42:15,060
In other words,
their evaluations of how attractive the 

2065
01:42:15,060 --> 01:42:17,551
woman was.
That not depend on which car she was 

2066
01:42:17,551 --> 01:42:17,551
seated in,
so

2067
01:42:17,551 --> 01:42:20,610
I would think that with men and with 
women that the women,

2068
01:42:20,611 --> 01:42:24,930
it would be more intimidating to the men
if the women drove a Bentley all because

2069
01:42:25,210 --> 01:42:29,460
they have status perhaps.
Well especially if you have a Toyota,

2070
01:42:29,461 --> 01:42:31,320
some crappy,
nice car,

2071
01:42:31,321 --> 01:42:32,070
Toyota,
you know,

2072
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:35,130
not a bad car but just not a high status
car.

2073
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:37,290
But if you pulled up in a,
you know,

2074
01:42:37,860 --> 01:42:38,700
whatever,
you know,

2075
01:42:38,730 --> 01:42:39,540
name it,
Chevy,

2076
01:42:39,541 --> 01:42:41,910
cobalt or something like that and the,
you know,

2077
01:42:41,911 --> 01:42:43,260
the girl you're going to go on a date 
with,

2078
01:42:43,261 --> 01:42:45,030
pulls up in a Lamborghini like,
ah,

2079
01:42:45,031 --> 01:42:46,160
what the fuck.
Right.

2080
01:42:46,410 --> 01:42:49,040
I would think that for some men they 
find that someone,

2081
01:42:49,170 --> 01:42:53,080
men find women that are very successful,
intimidating here.

2082
01:42:53,150 --> 01:42:58,150
They were just,
they were just asking them how good 

2083
01:42:58,150 --> 01:42:58,500
looking do you think they are?
So specific to physical attraction.

2084
01:42:58,530 --> 01:42:59,120
Okay.
Yeah.

2085
01:42:59,220 --> 01:43:00,030
So the.
Yeah,

2086
01:43:00,031 --> 01:43:02,400
I would say the physical attraction 
wouldn't change,

2087
01:43:02,401 --> 01:43:07,401
but I would say that the desire to 
approach that person or the willingness 

2088
01:43:07,401 --> 01:43:07,401
to approach that person.
I'm with you.

2089
01:43:07,401 --> 01:43:07,770
Yeah.
I think,

2090
01:43:07,771 --> 01:43:08,360
uh,
women with,

2091
01:43:08,430 --> 01:43:11,250
with like a really expensive car would 
be intimidating.

2092
01:43:11,750 --> 01:43:14,510
Third Study and then the personal story 
from my brother,

2093
01:43:14,820 --> 01:43:19,820
uh,
I did a study a few years ago where I 

2094
01:43:19,820 --> 01:43:22,001
brought.
This was a former graduate student of 

2095
01:43:22,001 --> 01:43:24,461
mine.
We brought people into the lab and then 

2096
01:43:24,461 --> 01:43:27,170
we rented a porsche.
This wasn't imagined.

2097
01:43:27,200 --> 01:43:30,170
You're driving a porsche.
We actually rented a Porsche and as I,

2098
01:43:30,410 --> 01:43:33,530
as I tell one of my ted talks,
try to get a,

2099
01:43:33,531 --> 01:43:37,340
a granting agency to release money to do
research where you're going,

2100
01:43:37,610 --> 01:43:42,610
where you're saying we're saying I'm 
going to rent a porsche for the weekend 

2101
01:43:42,610 --> 01:43:42,610
as part of my research.
So,

2102
01:43:42,610 --> 01:43:44,210
uh,
we rented a Porsche and then we had some

2103
01:43:44,211 --> 01:43:49,211
other beaten up car and we had the same 
men drive both cars either in downtown 

2104
01:43:50,541 --> 01:43:55,541
Montreal on a Friday evening where 
everybody could see you driving the car 

2105
01:43:55,541 --> 01:43:56,480
or on a semi desert highway where nobody
could see you.

2106
01:43:56,770 --> 01:43:58,700
And at the end of each of the driving 
conditions,

2107
01:43:58,970 --> 01:44:03,970
we collected salivary assets to then 
measure their fluctuating levels of 

2108
01:44:05,061 --> 01:44:05,840
testosterone.

2109
01:44:06,230 --> 01:44:09,170
And the idea being that when you put 
them in the Porsche,

2110
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:11,930
it's going to explode and that's exactly
what we found.

2111
01:44:12,690 --> 01:44:15,110
And now one of the reviewers had 
written,

2112
01:44:15,410 --> 01:44:16,350
he said,
what?

2113
01:44:16,370 --> 01:44:18,830
How do you know that that's just not 
because they're driving fast.

2114
01:44:18,860 --> 01:44:21,170
And so that's causing a rise in 
testosterone.

2115
01:44:21,470 --> 01:44:26,470
And the way we could control for that is
an downtown Montreal on a Friday 

2116
01:44:26,470 --> 01:44:28,520
evening.
It's bumper to bumper traffic.

2117
01:44:28,550 --> 01:44:29,060
It's,
I mean it's,

2118
01:44:29,070 --> 01:44:30,950
it's,
it's like being in a parking lot,

2119
01:44:31,160 --> 01:44:33,950
so it's certainly not because you were 
driving fast.

2120
01:44:34,160 --> 01:44:37,760
It's because everybody could see that I 
am sitting in a porsche.

2121
01:44:37,940 --> 01:44:42,940
So you're endocrinological system 
exploded simply because of this imbuing 

2122
01:44:42,940 --> 01:44:47,740
of social status to you.
And we know this from other animals 

2123
01:44:47,740 --> 01:44:47,740
where if you and I fight,
if we're two males,

2124
01:44:47,740 --> 01:44:48,620
we fight.
If you win,

2125
01:44:48,621 --> 01:44:51,560
your testosterone goes up.
If I lose my testosterone goes down.

2126
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:54,680
And so here we were applying this exact 
idea to the consumer setting.

2127
01:44:55,010 --> 01:45:00,010
So the person that was in the fast car 
that was on all deserted stretch of 

2128
01:45:00,501 --> 01:45:03,160
highway just going fast.
Their testosterone didn't rise.

2129
01:45:03,190 --> 01:45:03,740
No,
it did.

2130
01:45:03,790 --> 01:45:04,770
It did.
We actually

2131
01:45:04,850 --> 01:45:09,500
predicted that it would rise in both 
those conditions,

2132
01:45:09,770 --> 01:45:14,770
but it would rise more when there's a 
public audience to see you doing it.

2133
01:45:15,260 --> 01:45:20,260
That makes sense.
What we found is that irrespective of 

2134
01:45:20,260 --> 01:45:21,650
the environment,
you put a young male and a Porsche,

2135
01:45:21,830 --> 01:45:24,740
has endocrinological system explodes at 
the.

2136
01:45:24,790 --> 01:45:29,790
So the environment didn't matter.
Just the fact that you are interviewing 

2137
01:45:29,790 --> 01:45:30,330
me with this immediate social status,
uh,

2138
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:32,540
resulted in the same increase in 
testosterone.

2139
01:45:32,550 --> 01:45:37,550
Well,
there isn't it also an engine thing too 

2140
01:45:37,550 --> 01:45:39,951
with young men.
I know that they've done studies where 

2141
01:45:39,951 --> 01:45:41,610
they had young men rev engines just like
a v eight,

2142
01:45:41,750 --> 01:45:46,750
a powerful va.
Just the sound of that increases 

2143
01:45:46,750 --> 01:45:47,340
testosterone,
increases testosterone.

2144
01:45:47,370 --> 01:45:48,590
I think.
I know that study.

2145
01:45:48,670 --> 01:45:50,550
You ain't gonna need to send me that.
Yeah,

2146
01:45:50,810 --> 01:45:52,540
I will as soon as I find it.
Um,

2147
01:45:52,650 --> 01:45:53,730
but the,
the,

2148
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:58,760
the test that you give them,
how much of a variable or how much of a 

2149
01:45:58,760 --> 01:46:02,511
variance was there between not driving 
that car and driving that car 

2150
01:46:02,700 --> 01:46:07,700
statistically significant.
So it was certainly strong enough to 

2151
01:46:07,700 --> 01:46:09,180
pick up a big difference from the toyota
to the other car.

2152
01:46:09,480 --> 01:46:11,100
Do you remember the percentage?
I don't know.

2153
01:46:11,160 --> 01:46:13,770
I could send you the paper would be big 
for athletes.

2154
01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:18,800
Just drive around in a fast car.
It'd be good for your recovery because 

2155
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:19,540
testosterone with it.

2156
01:46:20,350 --> 01:46:25,350
Great.
With my wife and I tell her that since 

2157
01:46:25,350 --> 01:46:26,870
men as they enter middle age,
their testosterone goes down.

2158
01:46:27,170 --> 01:46:30,320
If I now have to buy a luxury car that's
just medically mandated,

2159
01:46:30,940 --> 01:46:35,450
well is that what's going on when men 
have this midlife crisis,

2160
01:46:35,690 --> 01:46:40,690
like that's always the joke with women 
that they see a guy in a ferrari and 

2161
01:46:40,821 --> 01:46:42,740
he's like 50 years old.
Sorry about your penis,

2162
01:46:44,540 --> 01:46:46,610
but is that.
Well I did.

2163
01:46:46,670 --> 01:46:49,860
I have a study that's not yet published.
Speaking the car.

2164
01:46:49,861 --> 01:46:50,010
You

2165
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:52,770
drive in some morphological features,
you're going to like this one.

2166
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:56,640
So this is not published yet.
With one of my former doctoral students,

2167
01:46:56,970 --> 01:47:01,970
we actually have.
We created online dating profiles of a 

2168
01:47:01,970 --> 01:47:05,961
man where everything's the same except 
that in one version his prized favorite 

2169
01:47:06,811 --> 01:47:11,811
position is a fancy red porsche or some 
shitty key or whatever it is.

2170
01:47:12,510 --> 01:47:17,510
And then we asked men and women who were
looking at this profile to evaluate the 

2171
01:47:17,731 --> 01:47:21,270
guy's height.
Watch what happened.

2172
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:26,840
Men,
when they evaluate the guy with the 

2173
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:29,811
porsche denigrate has height,
shorter women increases height.

2174
01:47:30,720 --> 01:47:33,390
This is exactly what you would expect 
from an evolutionary perspective,

2175
01:47:33,391 --> 01:47:33,910
right?
Sure.

2176
01:47:33,990 --> 01:47:37,020
Right status as a threatening queue for 
men.

2177
01:47:37,290 --> 01:47:40,170
Therefore it serves as an intrasexual 
rivalry queue.

2178
01:47:40,290 --> 01:47:42,870
So if you are in a fancy car or joe must
be some short,

2179
01:47:42,871 --> 01:47:44,970
wimpy guy,
women on the other hand,

2180
01:47:44,971 --> 01:47:47,030
we'll look at joe the exact same joe.

2181
01:47:47,060 --> 01:47:49,080
He your heIght didn't magically change 
and say,

2182
01:47:49,081 --> 01:47:50,340
wow,
joe was a tall guy.

2183
01:47:50,810 --> 01:47:53,790
Very fascinating.
You should study haters.

2184
01:47:54,080 --> 01:47:59,080
It's.
You should study like haters of 

2185
01:47:59,080 --> 01:48:01,131
celebrities,
like someone who becomes like a justin 

2186
01:48:01,131 --> 01:48:01,240
bieber type character,
especially someone who's a,

2187
01:48:01,260 --> 01:48:06,260
a famous person who women just go like 
if justin bieber goes anywhere in 

2188
01:48:06,260 --> 01:48:09,471
public,
women will literally scream and pass 

2189
01:48:09,471 --> 01:48:09,471
out.
LIke almost elvis.

2190
01:48:09,471 --> 01:48:13,320
Like in some ways he's just study like 
what the reaction is to men.

2191
01:48:13,321 --> 01:48:15,150
I wonder if there's a latest study that 
that is.

2192
01:48:15,180 --> 01:48:17,880
That's fascinating to me.
StudYing haters.

2193
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:19,560
That's a good one.
So let me tell you about my,

2194
01:48:19,620 --> 01:48:20,880
are we still okay on time?
Yeah,

2195
01:48:20,881 --> 01:48:22,140
that's great.
We have an hour.

2196
01:48:22,230 --> 01:48:23,500
Oh great.
Uh,

2197
01:48:23,730 --> 01:48:27,090
so I have a brother who was living in 
California for 30 years at,

2198
01:48:27,210 --> 01:48:32,210
who,
by the way I think I'd sent you this 

2199
01:48:32,210 --> 01:48:32,210
email,
was a fighter,

2200
01:48:32,210 --> 01:48:35,811
was a judo olympian,
judo fighter who played in the 19 plate 

2201
01:48:35,811 --> 01:48:37,230
who competed in the 1976 olympics.

2202
01:48:37,590 --> 01:48:39,120
So,
and he used to always say,

2203
01:48:39,121 --> 01:48:41,160
by the way,
before it was ever an entity,

2204
01:48:41,220 --> 01:48:46,220
I would always ask them if you were in a
fight at a bar against some boxer or 

2205
01:48:48,181 --> 01:48:52,620
some karate guy who would win,
which was kind of what started the whole

2206
01:48:52,621 --> 01:48:55,170
mna thing.
And he used to alwaYs tell me,

2207
01:48:55,710 --> 01:49:00,710
oh,
I will destroy them because they might 

2208
01:49:00,710 --> 01:49:01,290
get one hit on me,
but once I get them,

2209
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:03,950
then once we go down on the ground 
there,

2210
01:49:04,060 --> 01:49:05,240
they're done.
Uh,

2211
01:49:05,430 --> 01:49:06,280
so anyways,
uh,

2212
01:49:06,300 --> 01:49:07,000
so he,
he,

2213
01:49:07,030 --> 01:49:12,030
he made a lot,
a lot of money in the software industry 

2214
01:49:12,030 --> 01:49:13,380
in southern California.
And so he used,

2215
01:49:13,410 --> 01:49:16,110
he was the classic kind of peacocking 
guy.

2216
01:49:16,111 --> 01:49:19,480
He owned three ferrari's and aston 
martIn lagoon,

2217
01:49:19,490 --> 01:49:24,490
the so on and so we would.
He would play this game to,

2218
01:49:25,100 --> 01:49:26,310
to,
to my chagrin,

2219
01:49:26,340 --> 01:49:27,300
he liked to play this game.

2220
01:49:27,300 --> 01:49:32,300
We'd go to a nightclub.
This is before I was married in case my 

2221
01:49:32,300 --> 01:49:35,190
wife was listening,
but this was before we were married.

2222
01:49:36,450 --> 01:49:40,410
We would walk into a bar,
these fancy schmancy clubs,

2223
01:49:40,770 --> 01:49:45,770
and he'd say,
take your time and look around and find 

2224
01:49:45,770 --> 01:49:48,040
the most stunning unattainable in this 
space.

2225
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:51,160
Not take yoUr time.
So I'd go around,

2226
01:49:51,161 --> 01:49:56,161
look around.
I picked the girl who's not only the 

2227
01:49:56,161 --> 01:49:58,831
most beautiful,
but the one who is clearly accompanied 

2228
01:49:58,831 --> 01:50:02,281
by a guy who looks like a brute and they
seem to be very intensely in love.

2229
01:50:03,220 --> 01:50:08,220
So now it's.
I've really raised the bar of him not 

2230
01:50:08,220 --> 01:50:08,220
being able to get her.
Now.

2231
01:50:08,220 --> 01:50:08,220
My brother is about five,
four,

2232
01:50:08,220 --> 01:50:09,080
three.
So you know,

2233
01:50:09,120 --> 01:50:14,120
he's not taught so on.
But boise carrying the big testicles of 

2234
01:50:14,120 --> 01:50:15,750
owning almost ferrari's.
And so he said,

2235
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:16,450
okay,
that's the goal.

2236
01:50:16,451 --> 01:50:16,860
you,
you,

2237
01:50:16,910 --> 01:50:18,220
you,
you want me to approach?

2238
01:50:18,310 --> 01:50:23,310
Okay.
So the she had to wait like a shark and 

2239
01:50:23,310 --> 01:50:24,550
then the girl and the guy would go to 
the bathroom.

2240
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:28,870
He approached the girl he'd,
he'd come up to about here on her.

2241
01:50:28,900 --> 01:50:30,520
I mean,
it was just incredible to watch.

2242
01:50:31,180 --> 01:50:33,550
He'd come back to me and say,
she'll call me tomorrow.

2243
01:50:33,960 --> 01:50:35,830
I said,
absolutely zero chance.

2244
01:50:35,831 --> 01:50:36,940
David's,
it's not going to happen.

2245
01:50:37,030 --> 01:50:38,860
Next morning he'd say,
come over here.

2246
01:50:39,200 --> 01:50:44,200
It.
At the time we had the answering 

2247
01:50:44,200 --> 01:50:44,200
machines.
This is like maybe early nineties.

2248
01:50:44,590 --> 01:50:45,940
Hi david.
It's candy.

2249
01:50:45,941 --> 01:50:46,660
I was,
we met.

2250
01:50:46,680 --> 01:50:49,930
Yes.
Well what got him candy?

2251
01:50:50,170 --> 01:50:51,250
It was the fact that.

2252
01:50:51,560 --> 01:50:53,370
What would you say to them?
I don't know.

2253
01:50:53,490 --> 01:50:55,520
I have three ferrari's.
Come with me.

2254
01:50:55,590 --> 01:50:59,190
I like the you arabic accent.
I know you have a man,

2255
01:50:59,191 --> 01:51:00,840
but he is stupid.
Is big,

2256
01:51:00,841 --> 01:51:04,040
but he does not have cars.
But look,

2257
01:51:04,050 --> 01:51:07,590
the reality is that whenever we went 
anywhere in one of those cars,

2258
01:51:07,650 --> 01:51:11,130
I just noticed anecdotally that the 
women would be all over the place.

2259
01:51:11,160 --> 01:51:16,160
Is that changing with time when people 
become more aware of how kind of 

2260
01:51:16,160 --> 01:51:19,600
peacocky and it becomes more of a 
cultural sort of a caricature too?

2261
01:51:20,720 --> 01:51:20,930
right.

2262
01:51:21,290 --> 01:51:26,290
I think what happens is that the,
the product that we use for the 

2263
01:51:26,290 --> 01:51:27,560
peacocking might change.
So for example,

2264
01:51:27,561 --> 01:51:31,910
maybe in the cafe sipping a parties in 
hollywood.

2265
01:51:31,940 --> 01:51:34,360
It might be that I drive a prius.
You.

2266
01:51:34,370 --> 01:51:36,590
I was so happy you just said that.
Right?

2267
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:38,580
So that now makes me the,
the,

2268
01:51:38,590 --> 01:51:43,590
the top dog.
This is actually a paid for by a 

2269
01:51:43,590 --> 01:51:43,590
colleague of mine,
I think it's called

2270
01:51:43,590 --> 01:51:48,420
green to be seen,
which is basically a form of conspicuous

2271
01:51:49,241 --> 01:51:54,241
consumption based on being green rather 
than being in the big hummer or 

2272
01:51:54,241 --> 01:51:58,501
whatever.
So the bottom line is that the signal 

2273
01:51:58,501 --> 01:52:01,171
itself will change,
but the need to signal as a form of a 

2274
01:52:01,171 --> 01:52:03,880
mating strategy is always they're more 
progressive brownie points.

2275
01:52:04,510 --> 01:52:08,050
I keep track of the amount of prius's 
that I catch throwing cigarettes out the

2276
01:52:08,051 --> 01:52:09,220
window.
I'm up to eight,

2277
01:52:09,950 --> 01:52:14,950
eight creases in my life.
I have observed throwing cigarettes out 

2278
01:52:14,950 --> 01:52:18,631
the window.
I get fucking furious because I know 

2279
01:52:18,631 --> 01:52:18,820
those fucks.
I know what they're doing right?

2280
01:52:18,940 --> 01:52:20,680
They dry.
A lot of them drive those things,

2281
01:52:20,681 --> 01:52:23,020
not for the consumption,
not for gas,

2282
01:52:23,230 --> 01:52:26,800
low keeping gas prices down there doing 
it because they want to appear green.

2283
01:52:26,860 --> 01:52:27,370
Exactly.

2284
01:52:29,240 --> 01:52:34,240
There's actually studies that look at 
how much are you willing to pay extra 

2285
01:52:35,170 --> 01:52:40,170
for a green product and oftentimes what 
people say attitudinally and then what 

2286
01:52:41,051 --> 01:52:44,920
they do if it affects their dollar,
there's a big and continually so you see

2287
01:52:44,921 --> 01:52:46,250
the ocracy of people.

2288
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:46,970
Right.
Again,

2289
01:52:46,971 --> 01:52:47,960
as the posing,
right?

2290
01:52:48,430 --> 01:52:50,270
I mean I want to appear as though I'm 
enlightened,

2291
01:52:50,300 --> 01:52:52,370
progressive.
I care about mother earth and so.

2292
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:55,850
Well most certainly.
I mean I'm a hunter and I've experienced

2293
01:52:55,851 --> 01:53:00,851
this weird thing where people who were 
leather and eat meat get angry at you 

2294
01:53:00,981 --> 01:53:05,981
for hunting and one of the reasons why 
they're angry at you for hunting is 

2295
01:53:05,981 --> 01:53:08,450
somehow or another what you're doing is 
animal cruelty that you don't have to do

2296
01:53:08,451 --> 01:53:09,980
it.
Why not go to a supermarket?

2297
01:53:09,981 --> 01:53:13,250
This was like incredibly narrow minded 
way of thinking and I'm like,

2298
01:53:13,251 --> 01:53:16,280
you have a leather couch.
Do you understand that?

2299
01:53:16,281 --> 01:53:20,780
The animal that you set it on every day 
suffered,

2300
01:53:20,810 --> 01:53:23,740
unimaginable,
cruel to the animal that I shot,

2301
01:53:23,750 --> 01:53:26,750
didn't even know I was there until I put
an arrow through.

2302
01:53:26,751 --> 01:53:31,751
It's hard.
Do you ever feel any gumption at doing 

2303
01:53:31,751 --> 01:53:31,910
it or no?

2304
01:53:32,180 --> 01:53:33,280
Yeah.
No.

2305
01:53:33,281 --> 01:53:35,870
That definitely.
It's not an easy thing to do.

2306
01:53:35,970 --> 01:53:37,250
It's not I,
I eat meat.

2307
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:38,900
I liked me.
I've always eaten meat.

2308
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:43,960
Um,
I've worked out a lot and I find that 

2309
01:53:43,960 --> 01:53:43,960
I've,
I've,

2310
01:53:43,960 --> 01:53:43,960
I've tried being a vegetarian once when 
I was competing,

2311
01:53:43,960 --> 01:53:48,740
um,
back when I was fighting and I didn't 

2312
01:53:48,740 --> 01:53:49,520
perform as wild and have as much energy 
and it feels good and granted,

2313
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:54,760
in all fairness,
my knowledge of nutrition was far less 

2314
01:53:54,760 --> 01:53:58,631
than than it is now.
And I didn't have the beSt diet in the 

2315
01:53:58,631 --> 01:53:58,700
world was also very young.
But,

2316
01:53:58,950 --> 01:54:00,180
um,
I,

2317
01:54:00,500 --> 01:54:05,500
you know,
animals like humans live a finite life 

2318
01:54:05,500 --> 01:54:06,830
and I think that they eat each other.
They're the world that they live in is.

2319
01:54:06,831 --> 01:54:10,610
I'm an unbelievably cruel.
And if it wasn't for getting killed by a

2320
01:54:10,611 --> 01:54:15,611
hunter,
it's not like they're going to live 

2321
01:54:15,611 --> 01:54:15,611
forever and become magic.

2322
01:54:15,611 --> 01:54:15,611
Okay.
They,

2323
01:54:15,611 --> 01:54:19,430
they get killed by coyotes and mountain 
lions and I like going into that world 

2324
01:54:19,430 --> 01:54:22,370
and acquiring meet.
My goal is at the end of 2014.

2325
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:25,370
All the meat I eat at home to only be 
from my hunting.

2326
01:54:25,371 --> 01:54:26,270
Okay.
Yeah.

2327
01:54:26,271 --> 01:54:29,210
Because I feel like that's the most 
ethical way to do this.

2328
01:54:29,270 --> 01:54:32,780
I go to different places like I've been,
uh,

2329
01:54:32,840 --> 01:54:36,290
I've only been hunting for times.
I shot two deer.

2330
01:54:36,620 --> 01:54:41,620
I shot a pig and a wild pig and a shot a
bayer recently,

2331
01:54:41,990 --> 01:54:44,840
only animals that I eat,
only animals that I want to eat.

2332
01:54:45,140 --> 01:54:50,140
And my freezer is filled with bear meat,
venison and yeah,

2333
01:54:50,391 --> 01:54:51,400
I mean,
that's what I,

2334
01:54:51,410 --> 01:54:53,090
that's what I try to eat.
I try to eat that.

2335
01:54:53,180 --> 01:54:54,470
First of all,
it's super healthy,

2336
01:54:54,830 --> 01:54:55,370
you know,
the,

2337
01:54:55,371 --> 01:54:56,150
uh,
the animal,

2338
01:54:56,260 --> 01:54:59,210
you know,
hasn't been shot up with antibiotics and

2339
01:54:59,211 --> 01:55:01,310
hormones.
It's just a natural animal.

2340
01:55:01,400 --> 01:55:05,720
And again,
it's living its life in a wild way until

2341
01:55:05,870 --> 01:55:08,980
I dip into the food chain and remove it.
But it's not,

2342
01:55:09,320 --> 01:55:12,560
it doesn't,
it feels good to accomplish it.

2343
01:55:12,640 --> 01:55:16,670
Like the first time I did it,
it was much more somber than it is now.

2344
01:55:16,671 --> 01:55:18,220
Now it seems like,
um,

2345
01:55:18,280 --> 01:55:22,430
uh,
have sort of accepted what it is and I'm

2346
01:55:22,431 --> 01:55:24,650
a much happier after it's over.
I don't,

2347
01:55:24,651 --> 01:55:27,020
I don't have this sort of somber 
feeling.

2348
01:55:27,170 --> 01:55:30,290
the firsT time it was happiness,
but also like,

2349
01:55:30,320 --> 01:55:31,060
wow,
it just,

2350
01:55:31,250 --> 01:55:33,320
I just took an animal's life.
Big animal,

2351
01:55:33,321 --> 01:55:35,840
180 pound deer.
Like this is a lot of,

2352
01:55:36,230 --> 01:55:39,290
there's a lot involved in this.
This is real.

2353
01:55:39,410 --> 01:55:40,790
But what about,
what's your position?

2354
01:55:40,970 --> 01:55:43,100
We're talking about conspicuous 
consumption and signaling.

2355
01:55:43,350 --> 01:55:45,250
How about trophy hunting?
I don't like that at all.

2356
01:55:45,330 --> 01:55:50,330
I have a real problem with that.
Not only Do I have a real problem with 

2357
01:55:50,330 --> 01:55:52,701
trophy hunting,
I have a real problem with what they're 

2358
01:55:52,701 --> 01:55:52,701
doing in africa.

2359
01:55:52,701 --> 01:55:57,620
These days is a high fence hunting,
but it's very strange.

2360
01:55:57,841 --> 01:56:00,780
And here's the contradiction.
Here's where it gets weird.

2361
01:56:00,781 --> 01:56:02,760
I had louis theroux.
Do you know who he is?

2362
01:56:02,761 --> 01:56:06,430
The documentary and from england,
I'm not sure.

2363
01:56:06,640 --> 01:56:11,640
Great guy.
And really fascinating and beautiful 

2364
01:56:11,640 --> 01:56:14,400
documentary and he's just a really 
wonderful documentaries.

2365
01:56:14,760 --> 01:56:19,760
And he had this one where he went to 
this african hunting camp for several 

2366
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:24,470
weeks and stayed there and tried to 
really understand what it was all about 

2367
01:56:24,470 --> 01:56:24,960
and interviewed all these people and a 
lot of them were just despicable.

2368
01:56:25,200 --> 01:56:27,330
They're just these real hickey people.
Like,

2369
01:56:27,331 --> 01:56:28,180
yeah,
I'm just gonna.

2370
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:29,040
Get her.
I'm gonna.

2371
01:56:29,041 --> 01:56:31,050
Try to get the big five,
I'm going to get a ride home.

2372
01:56:31,051 --> 01:56:36,051
We get an elephant and all they want to 
do is spend money and bring home tusks 

2373
01:56:36,051 --> 01:56:39,621
and horns and all this different shit.
It's pretty gross because it's just 

2374
01:56:39,621 --> 01:56:43,370
they're killing to acquire trophies and 
what they're doing is they're killing 

2375
01:56:43,370 --> 01:56:44,580
inside these high fences where these 
animals,

2376
01:56:44,581 --> 01:56:47,820
it's not like you're out there,
you're going to.

2377
01:56:47,970 --> 01:56:52,970
And it's not to say that I'm opposed to 
high fence hunting because I think if 

2378
01:56:52,970 --> 01:56:55,890
you're hunting a deer or an animal that 
you're just going to eat,

2379
01:56:56,490 --> 01:57:01,490
it's essentially a like not that much 
different than going to a lake that's 

2380
01:57:01,490 --> 01:57:04,110
been stocked.
If you're going to a lake and they stock

2381
01:57:04,111 --> 01:57:06,590
the lake with trout to ensure that 
there's fish to fish,

2382
01:57:06,780 --> 01:57:09,600
those fish are not going to get out of 
that lake and flied in Nebraska.

2383
01:57:09,670 --> 01:57:10,710
Right.
That's where they live.

2384
01:57:10,860 --> 01:57:13,430
They're stuck there and I don't think 
there's any difference between that,

2385
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:15,930
like these high fence hunting operations
in Texas,

2386
01:57:15,931 --> 01:57:17,250
which I don't have any problem with it 
all.

2387
01:57:17,251 --> 01:57:21,630
They have like these thousand acres in.
One of them I know of is 14,000

2388
01:57:21,631 --> 01:57:25,050
acres and they keep deer on it.
And why do they have the fences up?

2389
01:57:25,080 --> 01:57:27,100
Well to keep poachers out to keep to.

2390
01:57:27,150 --> 01:57:31,290
And they also,
they make a lIving off of guiding people

2391
01:57:31,291 --> 01:57:34,350
to hunt these animals.
And for them it's like the ethical,

2392
01:57:34,780 --> 01:57:37,890
uh,
acquiring of have your own meat and it's

2393
01:57:37,891 --> 01:57:39,330
venison.
It's very delicious.

2394
01:57:39,660 --> 01:57:41,310
Tastes good.
It's good for you.

2395
01:57:41,311 --> 01:57:43,410
It's very healthy meat.
I don't have a problem with that.

2396
01:57:43,890 --> 01:57:48,890
With the african thing is so confusing 
because there was a woman recently that 

2397
01:57:48,890 --> 01:57:52,230
was on the news this past week.
She was 19 years old.

2398
01:57:52,410 --> 01:57:57,410
She went to africa and took all these 
photos with her than with a lion that 

2399
01:57:57,410 --> 01:57:58,080
she killed.
I might have shared that on myself,

2400
01:57:58,110 --> 01:57:58,930
but that wasn't a week.
Who?

2401
01:57:58,931 --> 01:58:01,820
I did one you did recently,
but it was a different one.

2402
01:58:02,930 --> 01:58:06,330
I've followed all your stuff for awhile.
Um,

2403
01:58:06,331 --> 01:58:07,020
but,
um,

2404
01:58:07,080 --> 01:58:12,080
you had you,
you said it's disgusting and she was 

2405
01:58:12,080 --> 01:58:12,350
holding the mouth.
Yeah,

2406
01:58:12,390 --> 01:58:14,970
that's dark.
There's something dark about that man.

2407
01:58:14,970 --> 01:58:16,650
I mean,
if you're not going to eat that animal.

2408
01:58:16,720 --> 01:58:20,100
I mean I don't.
I have a friend is going lion hunting in

2409
01:58:20,101 --> 01:58:22,800
the wild.
He's a bowhunters named cameron hanes.

2410
01:58:22,920 --> 01:58:25,200
He's going to eat a lion though.
He's going to go over there.

2411
01:58:25,201 --> 01:58:26,370
He's going to hunt it in,
in,

2412
01:58:26,450 --> 01:58:27,810
in the.
Not in the high fence.

2413
01:58:27,990 --> 01:58:30,350
He's going to Zimbabwe and the actual 
jungle.

2414
01:58:30,351 --> 01:58:32,160
He's got a hunt,
a lion and he's going to eat it.

2415
01:58:32,220 --> 01:58:33,750
You know,
he's fucking crazy to,

2416
01:58:33,820 --> 01:58:34,330
to,
to,

2417
01:58:34,480 --> 01:58:39,480
to,
to collect salivary assets from these 

2418
01:58:39,480 --> 01:58:39,480
types of guys.
Pre,

2419
01:58:39,480 --> 01:58:40,440
pre,
no post killed.

2420
01:58:40,500 --> 01:58:41,530
But he's got.
Oh,

2421
01:58:41,531 --> 01:58:44,260
testosterone before and after.
Right.

2422
01:58:44,290 --> 01:58:46,650
But I guarantee you that it jumps up 
when he,

2423
01:58:46,710 --> 01:58:48,010
uh,
she would say he,

2424
01:58:48,011 --> 01:58:49,940
he's the one who took me bear hunting.
wow.

2425
01:58:50,050 --> 01:58:50,900
Yeah.
He's a,

2426
01:58:51,030 --> 01:58:54,190
he's probably one of the most famous bow
hunters in America today,

2427
01:58:54,191 --> 01:58:55,630
probably in the world actually.

2428
01:58:55,660 --> 01:58:59,050
He's a legit bowhunter.
He makes his living doing that.

2429
01:58:59,051 --> 01:59:04,051
And he's a very famous because of the 
very ethical though he does not shoot 

2430
01:59:04,051 --> 01:59:05,080
anything.
He does not eat everything he shoots.

2431
01:59:05,081 --> 01:59:07,180
He eats.
And I think that's where,

2432
01:59:07,181 --> 01:59:09,270
um,
that's where I have an issue with this,

2433
01:59:09,300 --> 01:59:10,660
this,
this africa thing.

2434
01:59:10,870 --> 01:59:13,540
But where it gets weird is that those 
animals,

2435
01:59:13,541 --> 01:59:15,580
many of them were on the verge of 
extinction,

2436
01:59:15,760 --> 01:59:17,950
but now they are,
they're in very high numbers.

2437
01:59:18,160 --> 01:59:20,730
The reason being is that they're in 
these events operation.

2438
01:59:20,750 --> 01:59:25,750
So it's such a catch 22.
On one hand they were on the verge of 

2439
01:59:25,750 --> 01:59:28,420
extinction and another hand.
Now they have these high populations and

2440
01:59:28,421 --> 01:59:32,290
they're super healthy,
but they only exist as a commodity to be

2441
01:59:32,291 --> 01:59:33,940
hunted down.
I mean,

2442
01:59:33,970 --> 01:59:38,970
in the way they're doing it was like,
it was a waterhole and there's like 100 

2443
01:59:38,970 --> 01:59:40,390
animals in front of waterhole.
And these people Just sit there and they

2444
01:59:40,400 --> 01:59:42,980
just shoot one.
They'll look what I did on my hun.

2445
01:59:43,240 --> 01:59:44,350
Like,
is that even a hunt?

2446
01:59:44,680 --> 01:59:46,090
You're in a park.
I mean,

2447
01:59:46,091 --> 01:59:49,120
you're in a fenced in for like someone's
yard.

2448
01:59:49,160 --> 01:59:50,140
You're not tracking.

2449
01:59:52,180 --> 01:59:56,080
You're not only not tracking those 
animals,

2450
01:59:56,320 --> 02:00:00,550
they're never going to leave and go 100 
miles away to a different place.

2451
02:00:00,551 --> 02:00:01,090
And then,
you know,

2452
02:00:01,120 --> 02:00:04,610
go across the river to mule deer.
They,

2453
02:00:04,611 --> 02:00:06,640
they discovered that mule deer in 
America.

2454
02:00:06,641 --> 02:00:10,300
This is a really recent discovery.
They had no idea how far they migrate,

2455
02:00:10,301 --> 02:00:13,900
but they migrate as much as 150 miles in
a year.

2456
02:00:14,140 --> 02:00:19,140
One hundred and 50 miles is a lot of 
walking man for a deer that's like here 

2457
02:00:19,140 --> 02:00:21,700
to fucking san diego for a deer,
you know?

2458
02:00:21,701 --> 02:00:24,880
And they're just starting to understand 
their migratory patterns.

2459
02:00:25,270 --> 02:00:27,190
And that's.
But that's a wIld animal.

2460
02:00:27,220 --> 02:00:30,010
Now if you,
that's what I consider a fair chase,

2461
02:00:30,030 --> 02:00:31,210
right?
You go out hunting,

2462
02:00:31,211 --> 02:00:34,270
you find a mule deer that's walking 150 
miles,

2463
02:00:34,271 --> 02:00:36,130
you figured out where they're going to 
be and you know,

2464
02:00:36,131 --> 02:00:40,240
and then stalk them and get into a good 
position and shoot them and eat them.

2465
02:00:40,510 --> 02:00:45,510
So about as fair and ethical way as you 
can acquire your own meat if you're 

2466
02:00:45,510 --> 02:00:48,340
going all the way to africa and you're 
not even going to eat that animal.

2467
02:00:48,490 --> 02:00:53,490
And he just kinda like stuff it and 
stick it on your wall to let everybody 

2468
02:00:53,490 --> 02:00:55,120
know how billy bad ass you are.
That's weird man.

2469
02:00:55,210 --> 02:01:00,210
That's weird aspect of human beings that
we would even consider that to be a form

2470
02:01:00,281 --> 02:01:01,750
of recreation,
you know,

2471
02:01:02,020 --> 02:01:02,950
and people go,
well,

2472
02:01:02,951 --> 02:01:04,870
hey,
it's totally legal and well hey,

2473
02:01:04,871 --> 02:01:05,890
there's nothing,
you know,

2474
02:01:05,891 --> 02:01:06,230
the,
the,

2475
02:01:06,240 --> 02:01:10,600
the money goes to conservation and I 
guess it does in a way.

2476
02:01:10,660 --> 02:01:15,660
I guess it does.
It does go to keep these animals alive 

2477
02:01:15,660 --> 02:01:15,660
so they can keep killing them.
It's weird.

2478
02:01:15,790 --> 02:01:18,700
It's very weird.
So you have also a paleo Guy.

2479
02:01:19,300 --> 02:01:20,080
Well,
you know what,

2480
02:01:20,081 --> 02:01:24,490
that whole paleo thing,
I don't like that term paleo because the

2481
02:01:24,491 --> 02:01:29,380
term is been debunked by science and you
talked about like what people did or did

2482
02:01:29,381 --> 02:01:29,980
not eat.

2483
02:01:31,540 --> 02:01:34,570
I think that natural foods are more 
easily digestible.

2484
02:01:34,571 --> 02:01:37,270
I try to stay aWay from bread as much as
possible.

2485
02:01:37,490 --> 02:01:42,490
Although I do.
I have started eating more sprouted 

2486
02:01:42,490 --> 02:01:42,620
bread recently,
like a csi type bread.

2487
02:01:42,890 --> 02:01:44,990
I feel like my body digest that more 
easily.

2488
02:01:44,991 --> 02:01:49,991
I think it's a little healthier.
I keep away from white flour and pastas 

2489
02:01:49,991 --> 02:01:54,281
and things along those lines and I try 
to avoid processed foods as much as 

2490
02:01:54,281 --> 02:01:57,260
possible and sugar as much as possible.
So in that sense,

2491
02:01:57,261 --> 02:01:58,520
yeah,
I eat a lot of vegetables.

2492
02:01:58,521 --> 02:02:00,290
I eat a lot of protein,
animal protein,

2493
02:02:00,291 --> 02:02:04,250
fish and things along those lines,
but I just think I'm just real.

2494
02:02:04,550 --> 02:02:07,850
I noticed because I work out so much and
because I,

2495
02:02:08,130 --> 02:02:12,830
I do athletics where you sort of measure
your progress,

2496
02:02:13,100 --> 02:02:18,100
whether it's my workout routines like 
strength and conditioning routines or 

2497
02:02:18,100 --> 02:02:21,370
martial arts.
I kind of see what I'm on and when I'm 

2498
02:02:21,370 --> 02:02:24,071
off and I can anecdotally or directly 
correlate that between my to my diet and

2499
02:02:24,861 --> 02:02:29,861
I find that when I take supplements and 
I make sure that I have plenty of 

2500
02:02:29,861 --> 02:02:30,830
vitamins and plenty of green leafy 
vegetables,

2501
02:02:30,831 --> 02:02:32,390
that's one of the most important ones I 
think,

2502
02:02:32,630 --> 02:02:33,860
and healthy proteins.

2503
02:02:34,100 --> 02:02:39,100
So in that sense I,
I eat along the lines that allow those 

2504
02:02:39,100 --> 02:02:39,100
paleo guys eat

2505
02:02:39,100 --> 02:02:39,100
great.
You know,

2506
02:02:39,100 --> 02:02:39,220
I,
I,

2507
02:02:39,280 --> 02:02:41,790
when I used to be a very competitive 
soccer player,

2508
02:02:41,791 --> 02:02:45,270
I was grossly underweight my whole life.
I mean one slash 25,

2509
02:02:45,480 --> 02:02:50,480
30 pounds,
four percent body fat just from running 

2510
02:02:50,480 --> 02:02:50,480
all the time,
reading all the time,

2511
02:02:50,480 --> 02:02:52,050
training.
I even found some marathons.

2512
02:02:52,560 --> 02:02:57,560
The day that I stopped training was this
sort of pernicious and insidious weight 

2513
02:02:58,291 --> 02:03:00,420
gain.
It wasn't sort of,

2514
02:03:00,421 --> 02:03:05,421
you saw me one one year,
I was 125 in the next year I was one 

2515
02:03:05,421 --> 02:03:05,421
eight.
It was always four,

2516
02:03:05,421 --> 02:03:06,480
five,
eight pounds a year.

2517
02:03:06,660 --> 02:03:07,710
And then one day,
eIght,

2518
02:03:07,711 --> 02:03:09,960
nine years later,
I get on this kid and I'm tipping to 100

2519
02:03:10,500 --> 02:03:13,140
and the most,
I got up to fIfty two,

2520
02:03:13,141 --> 02:03:16,020
I'm five foot six,
2:58.

2521
02:03:16,060 --> 02:03:17,760
Whoa,
you're heavyweight.

2522
02:03:18,210 --> 02:03:21,000
Exactly.
And now I've lost about 25,

2523
02:03:21,001 --> 02:03:21,960
30 pounds,
but still,

2524
02:03:21,961 --> 02:03:23,700
even now,
I mean I'm over 200 pounds.

2525
02:03:24,030 --> 02:03:27,600
And one of the things that I've,
that I've been doing is,

2526
02:03:27,680 --> 02:03:28,950
uh,
eating,

2527
02:03:28,980 --> 02:03:33,980
as you said,
a lot of vegetables and a lot of 

2528
02:03:33,980 --> 02:03:33,980
protein,
staying away from all the starchy stuff.

2529
02:03:34,020 --> 02:03:37,410
And I'm using my fitness pal.com.
Do you know this thing,

2530
02:03:37,411 --> 02:03:42,411
this calorie counting program?
It's part of this whole quantify 

2531
02:03:42,411 --> 02:03:44,480
yourself.
So basically my,

2532
02:03:44,850 --> 02:03:46,470
I have to give credit to my wife.
She,

2533
02:03:46,530 --> 02:03:51,530
she literally counts every single 
calorie that goes into my body after 

2534
02:03:51,530 --> 02:03:54,210
basically 1400 calories in a day,
uh,

2535
02:03:54,420 --> 02:03:59,420
including exercise and so on.
And so as long as I hit 1400 calories 

2536
02:03:59,420 --> 02:04:01,770
net that day and I've lost so far,
25 pounds and maybe three months.

2537
02:04:01,950 --> 02:04:03,070
So that's amazing.
Yeah.

2538
02:04:03,370 --> 02:04:05,080
Great.
Number 25 pounds in three years.

2539
02:04:05,230 --> 02:04:06,400
Yeah,
I mean,

2540
02:04:06,401 --> 02:04:08,230
now it's not totally fast too.
That's good.

2541
02:04:08,231 --> 02:04:08,890
Yeah.
Yeah.

2542
02:04:08,990 --> 02:04:13,990
I've now it's getting a bit rough.
I can't seem to break the next sort of 

2543
02:04:13,990 --> 02:04:14,350
hump.
What do you do for exercise?

2544
02:04:14,890 --> 02:04:15,610
So I,
I'm,

2545
02:04:15,620 --> 02:04:17,380
I'm a cardio guy,
so maybe,

2546
02:04:17,381 --> 02:04:18,070
I don't know.
Maybe you'll,

2547
02:04:18,100 --> 02:04:19,810
you'll,
you'll guide me in better ways.

2548
02:04:20,080 --> 02:04:25,080
So I just do tons of cardio so it could 
be I run on the treadmill or I do 

2549
02:04:25,080 --> 02:04:29,311
stationary bike or I do elliptical.
I usually try to average between 45 

2550
02:04:29,311 --> 02:04:29,680
minutes to an hour of cardio.

2551
02:04:29,820 --> 02:04:30,360
Right?
No,

2552
02:04:30,390 --> 02:04:31,740
no doubt about it.
And you know,

2553
02:04:31,741 --> 02:04:36,741
there's nothing better than having a 
good gas tank and having a healthy 

2554
02:04:36,741 --> 02:04:37,380
heart.
But I'm one of the things that burns the

2555
02:04:37,381 --> 02:04:40,860
most is muscle and the more muscle that 
you can put on your body,

2556
02:04:40,861 --> 02:04:44,040
the stronger you can make yourself.
It's kind of strange,

2557
02:04:44,041 --> 02:04:45,300
but you get leaner.
Yeah.

2558
02:04:45,310 --> 02:04:46,750
Your metabolism goes up.
So yeah.

2559
02:04:46,780 --> 02:04:48,390
Yeah.
And I just find,

2560
02:04:48,391 --> 02:04:52,590
I just feel better when I'm stronger,
my body works better.

2561
02:04:52,591 --> 02:04:55,770
I liked the way it feels better and I 
think that I can eat more.

2562
02:04:56,160 --> 02:04:56,700
You know,
I,

2563
02:04:56,710 --> 02:04:58,530
I'm a pig,
I like eating,

2564
02:04:58,560 --> 02:05:01,200
but I'm pretty lean for someone who eats
as much as i eat.

2565
02:05:01,480 --> 02:05:03,540
I have you ever seen me eat?
People freak out,

2566
02:05:03,541 --> 02:05:05,330
like,
especially like after comedy shows,

2567
02:05:05,331 --> 02:05:09,510
I'll do like two shows in a night and 
I'll have two entrees and a salad and an

2568
02:05:09,511 --> 02:05:13,200
appetizer to the point where waitresses 
think I'm joking and I'm like,

2569
02:05:13,201 --> 02:05:14,280
nope,
I'm serious.

2570
02:05:14,280 --> 02:05:15,890
I'm going to eat all that too.
Wow.

2571
02:05:16,200 --> 02:05:18,030
I eat a lot of food.
But um,

2572
02:05:18,090 --> 02:05:23,090
and I love it.
So the way I make sure that I stay lean 

2573
02:05:23,090 --> 02:05:24,030
is I do a lot of exercise and a lot of 
weightlifting.

2574
02:05:24,340 --> 02:05:26,460
I think that weightlifting by weight 
lifting,

2575
02:05:26,461 --> 02:05:31,461
I'm not doing a lot of the traditional 
stuff like bench pressing and most of 

2576
02:05:31,461 --> 02:05:33,010
the stuff I do is full body exercises,
kettlebells,

2577
02:05:33,030 --> 02:05:35,490
things along those lines.
But when I do that,

2578
02:05:35,491 --> 02:05:39,630
all that intense strain that's not 
available through cardio cardio,

2579
02:05:39,780 --> 02:05:42,540
you could do sprinting and you can 
really get your heart rate up and really

2580
02:05:42,541 --> 02:05:47,541
get exhausted.
You certainly burn off a lot of 

2581
02:05:47,541 --> 02:05:48,310
calories,
but that intense strain up fucking,

2582
02:05:49,260 --> 02:05:54,260
that's what makes bone density.
That's what makes your tendons and the 

2583
02:05:54,260 --> 02:05:55,460
attendance stronger,
muscle density strong,

2584
02:05:55,740 --> 02:05:58,290
more thick,
and I think that also helps your calorie

2585
02:05:58,291 --> 02:05:59,180
consumption.
That's cool.

2586
02:05:59,600 --> 02:06:01,220
Speaking of comedians,
I just,

2587
02:06:01,520 --> 02:06:06,520
because very organic what's going on.
I just hired a postdoc who's claim to 

2588
02:06:06,681 --> 02:06:11,180
fame so far until he gets into my 
research program was he was studying the

2589
02:06:11,181 --> 02:06:14,340
evolutionary roots of humor.
Oh,

2590
02:06:14,360 --> 02:06:19,360
that's interesting.
And so what he basically looked at is 

2591
02:06:19,360 --> 02:06:22,040
umer as a sexually select that trait as 
a proxy for intelligence.

2592
02:06:22,370 --> 02:06:27,370
And so with his former doctoral 
supervisor who's a well known evolution 

2593
02:06:27,370 --> 02:06:32,281
psychologists,
they would go into comedy clubs and a 

2594
02:06:32,510 --> 02:06:37,400
rate people's impressions of how funny 
the comedian is,

2595
02:06:37,580 --> 02:06:42,580
and then we administer iq test to them 
and it turns out that funnier people are

2596
02:06:44,751 --> 02:06:47,810
actually smarter people.
And so when women say,

2597
02:06:48,800 --> 02:06:50,000
you know,
I'd love,

2598
02:06:50,120 --> 02:06:50,780
you know,
they always say,

2599
02:06:50,781 --> 02:06:53,450
I want a guy with a sense of humor.
I want a guy who makes me laugh.

2600
02:06:53,690 --> 02:06:58,690
Whether effectively saying as a,
as a proxy measure is I want the guy 

2601
02:06:58,690 --> 02:07:00,170
who's intelligence because intelligence 
is a heritable trait.

2602
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:03,560
Interesting.
But I bet that's wrong.

2603
02:07:04,340 --> 02:07:06,610
Here's why that's wrong.
I know my,

2604
02:07:06,780 --> 02:07:10,040
my favorite comedian of all time is my 
friend joey diaz,

2605
02:07:10,190 --> 02:07:12,920
I think he's the funniest guy that's 
ever lived and uh,

2606
02:07:12,990 --> 02:07:16,850
he is a very smart guy as far as like 
street smarts,

2607
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:22,000
wisdom and he knows a lot about life.
If you gave him a fucking iq test 

2608
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:23,690
though,
he might barely beat a chimp.

2609
02:07:23,990 --> 02:07:28,990
Right?
So I think what you're basically saying 

2610
02:07:28,990 --> 02:07:29,450
is that iq might not be the way to 
measure intelligence,

2611
02:07:29,850 --> 02:07:34,850
but what,
but you are admitting that he is 

2612
02:07:34,850 --> 02:07:34,910
probably very intelligent and he's most 
certainly very.

2613
02:07:35,380 --> 02:07:35,990
So then that's

2614
02:07:36,110 --> 02:07:37,760
supporting the general theory.
Oh,

2615
02:07:37,780 --> 02:07:42,780
it's the general theories on.
I just think that iq intelligence 

2616
02:07:42,780 --> 02:07:42,780
doesn't matter.
your social intelligence.

2617
02:07:43,120 --> 02:07:48,120
He's very socially intelligent.
Like he spots like he's a predator in 

2618
02:07:48,120 --> 02:07:52,141
some ways.
Like he spots like the weakness the 

2619
02:07:52,141 --> 02:07:52,460
person has and is with this motherFucker
with his goofy.

2620
02:07:52,690 --> 02:07:55,900
He'll find out the one thing about you,
oh yeah,

2621
02:07:55,901 --> 02:07:57,220
that's not what you're thinking.
You know,

2622
02:07:57,221 --> 02:07:59,380
he'll,
he'll find the one thing that,

2623
02:07:59,381 --> 02:08:01,240
you know,
you're trying to pretend you're not,

2624
02:08:01,241 --> 02:08:06,241
but you truly are.
And it'll like illuminated like glowing 

2625
02:08:06,241 --> 02:08:08,080
thing here.
This guy is actually a,

2626
02:08:08,081 --> 02:08:10,470
this is actually have that.
He's lying about this.

2627
02:08:10,990 --> 02:08:15,990
Most certainly know there's a study that
was done with ceos and the number one 

2628
02:08:15,990 --> 02:08:20,671
thing that they all had in common other 
than on average being taller than the 

2629
02:08:20,671 --> 02:08:22,330
norm ceos and taller than the noise 
there.

2630
02:08:22,430 --> 02:08:25,260
I fascinated there I think six foot two 
or some.

2631
02:08:25,340 --> 02:08:27,760
Some of them,
I can't remember exactly the number a is

2632
02:08:27,761 --> 02:08:30,610
that they had very high social 
intelligence.

2633
02:08:30,790 --> 02:08:31,770
Yeah,
it makes sense.

2634
02:08:31,771 --> 02:08:32,480
It makes sense,
right?

2635
02:08:32,530 --> 02:08:36,570
If you're an operating officer,
you're trying to keep everybody in line.

2636
02:08:36,580 --> 02:08:39,220
There's a lot of social intelligence 
required to do that,

2637
02:08:39,221 --> 02:08:43,410
to manage a giant group of people and 
keep everybody happy and you know,

2638
02:08:43,411 --> 02:08:46,900
in foster morale and yeah,
there's a lot involved in that.

2639
02:08:47,170 --> 02:08:49,330
Here'S an interesting one.
A number.

2640
02:08:49,331 --> 02:08:51,030
Earlier we were talking about,
uh,

2641
02:08:51,220 --> 02:08:56,220
you know,
how these hollywood types are lying to 

2642
02:08:56,220 --> 02:08:56,560
themselves and the privacy of their 
bedrooms.

2643
02:08:56,790 --> 02:08:58,120
How we brought that back up.
Again,

2644
02:08:58,121 --> 02:09:00,790
there's more to talk about that.
you're gonna like this one.

2645
02:09:01,210 --> 02:09:06,210
So I've often wondered whether they 
believe the hype that they say.

2646
02:09:06,251 --> 02:09:09,190
In other words,
when somebody is posing in this way,

2647
02:09:09,250 --> 02:09:14,250
do you,
do they truly kind of internalized this 

2648
02:09:14,250 --> 02:09:14,250
or not?

2649
02:09:14,250 --> 02:09:18,750
There's a fantastic evolutionary theory 
that looks at the evolutionary roots of 

2650
02:09:18,750 --> 02:09:23,101
self deception and other words.
Why is it that we are so good at self 

2651
02:09:23,101 --> 02:09:26,500
deceiving ourselves?
This is by a guy named by name of robert

2652
02:09:26,501 --> 02:09:28,170
trevors,
phenomenological biologist,

2653
02:09:28,690 --> 02:09:33,690
and he proposed the theory that I think 
is brilliant in its simplicity and then 

2654
02:09:33,690 --> 02:09:35,470
what I usually do is to demonstrate the 
phenomenon.

2655
02:09:35,471 --> 02:09:40,471
I go to a television shoW like seinfeld 
to find a manifestation of that 

2656
02:09:40,781 --> 02:09:42,130
phenomenon,
which I'll talk about In a sec.

2657
02:09:42,880 --> 02:09:47,880
So he says that one of the biggest 
dangers that we face as humans is to 

2658
02:09:48,641 --> 02:09:51,730
navigate all of these social threats in 
our environment.

2659
02:09:51,731 --> 02:09:56,731
Right?
So I'm trying to manipulate you while 

2660
02:09:56,731 --> 02:09:58,090
you're trying to read me to see my 
manipulative intent.

2661
02:09:58,091 --> 02:10:00,430
That's called machIavellian intelligence
or social intelligence.

2662
02:10:01,120 --> 02:10:06,120
So one of the ways that I could fool you
without you picking up that I am fooling

2663
02:10:06,581 --> 02:10:11,581
you is if any visual cue in my,
in my face that would signal that I am 

2664
02:10:13,361 --> 02:10:16,090
lying,
I would shut it off the way you,

2665
02:10:16,120 --> 02:10:21,120
because then you can't read that.
And the way you do that is by deceiving 

2666
02:10:21,120 --> 02:10:21,970
yourself.
In other words,

2667
02:10:22,510 --> 02:10:24,390
if you understand what I'm saying,
yes,

2668
02:10:24,870 --> 02:10:27,010
I want to lie to you.
I want to deceive you.

2669
02:10:27,011 --> 02:10:32,011
I want to make you do a.
But you're going to be looking at me to 

2670
02:10:32,011 --> 02:10:34,130
see whether there is any visual

2671
02:10:34,130 --> 02:10:39,130
signals that shows that I'm lying.
If I could suppress those by first lying

2672
02:10:39,291 --> 02:10:41,840
to myself,
then you can't pick up that online.

2673
02:10:42,330 --> 02:10:47,330
So then,
so there's a show on seinfeld and I 

2674
02:10:47,330 --> 02:10:49,371
said,
how can I demonstrate this to make a 

2675
02:10:49,371 --> 02:10:51,511
sort of more sexy in my book?
So there's a short on seinfeld where 

2676
02:10:51,511 --> 02:10:53,960
george castanza,
who was kind of the licit,

2677
02:10:53,961 --> 02:10:55,940
this devious guy,
uh,

2678
02:10:55,960 --> 02:11:00,960
is,
is trying to teach jerry how to be a 

2679
02:11:00,960 --> 02:11:04,541
better liar.
And one day as he's about to leave his 

2680
02:11:04,541 --> 02:11:04,541
apartment,
he looks at him.

2681
02:11:04,541 --> 02:11:05,090
He Says,
remember jerry,

2682
02:11:05,240 --> 02:11:08,090
it's not a lie if you believe it,
and I said,

2683
02:11:08,091 --> 02:11:10,760
that's it.
That's exactly the evolutionary roots of

2684
02:11:10,761 --> 02:11:11,840
self deception.
Right?

2685
02:11:12,290 --> 02:11:14,420
So you the evolutionary theories 
everywhere,

2686
02:11:14,421 --> 02:11:15,710
man.
It explains everything.

2687
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:16,550
I certainly do.

2688
02:11:16,550 --> 02:11:21,550
I think you're correct in that.
I think there's definitely something 

2689
02:11:21,550 --> 02:11:22,270
there,
but I can also offer some unique insight

2690
02:11:22,300 --> 02:11:25,150
as to the celebrity thing,
what it what it is,

2691
02:11:25,151 --> 02:11:28,750
because I've been a part of it and I've 
also experienced it myself.

2692
02:11:28,810 --> 02:11:32,680
I've experienced mY own self deception 
on my own ego swelling,

2693
02:11:32,681 --> 02:11:37,681
like in an unnatural way.
It's because of the environment that 

2694
02:11:37,681 --> 02:11:38,740
you're constantly enter the data that 
you're getting,

2695
02:11:38,741 --> 02:11:40,780
the data that you're getting.
If you're a star.

2696
02:11:41,020 --> 02:11:43,930
I've seen now I'm a nice person,
but I,

2697
02:11:43,931 --> 02:11:48,931
I've seen people get shows and become 
these fucking ruthless dictators like 

2698
02:11:50,351 --> 02:11:54,910
people that have sitcoms or shows that 
revolved entirely around them.

2699
02:11:55,150 --> 02:11:57,040
I got like a,
not seinfeld,

2700
02:11:57,050 --> 02:12:02,050
he's supposedly a very nice guy,
but like there's this famous story of 

2701
02:12:02,050 --> 02:12:05,731
brett butler's from that show,
grace under fire about what a useless 

2702
02:12:05,731 --> 02:12:06,340
monster she became when she was on the 
show.

2703
02:12:06,610 --> 02:12:09,070
Granted substance abuse was in there as 
well,

2704
02:12:09,700 --> 02:12:11,620
which I think may also,
you know,

2705
02:12:11,770 --> 02:12:16,770
not just because of the fact that she'd 
probably have addictive tendencies to 

2706
02:12:16,770 --> 02:12:20,881
begin with.
A lot of comedians tend to be impulsive 

2707
02:12:20,881 --> 02:12:21,430
and a lot of them had tend to have 
addiction issues as well.

2708
02:12:21,431 --> 02:12:26,431
I'm sure that played into it as well,
but also the pressure of being the one 

2709
02:12:26,431 --> 02:12:31,360
to pressure of being this one person 
where when brett butler shows up on the 

2710
02:12:31,360 --> 02:12:31,960
set,
everyone has a coffee for.

2711
02:12:32,140 --> 02:12:33,640
There's a script,
we get anything.

2712
02:12:33,641 --> 02:12:35,770
Bret,
they're all treading lightly,

2713
02:12:35,771 --> 02:12:38,080
you know,
they're all like worried constantly that

2714
02:12:38,081 --> 02:12:40,600
she's going to be upset at them.
So their data,

2715
02:12:40,690 --> 02:12:45,460
the data that a person like a brett 
butler or some star has is that they are

2716
02:12:45,461 --> 02:12:48,280
special.
That's all the data they're getting.

2717
02:12:48,670 --> 02:12:51,280
The data,
the data that someone who has,

2718
02:12:51,310 --> 02:12:53,080
you know,
someone who's not attractive,

2719
02:12:53,350 --> 02:12:54,970
they're,
they're the only data,

2720
02:12:55,030 --> 02:12:59,770
like a lot of data that comes from a 
person who is not physically attracted.

2721
02:12:59,770 --> 02:13:00,280
It'S like,
well,

2722
02:13:00,700 --> 02:13:03,880
I found out that I can get people to 
like me if I make them laugh,

2723
02:13:04,090 --> 02:13:09,090
so I'm going to develop a good sense of 
humor because my nose isn't getting any 

2724
02:13:09,090 --> 02:13:09,430
smaller.
My ears aren't getting any little or I'm

2725
02:13:09,431 --> 02:13:12,160
not getting any taller.
I'm fucking not losing any weight,

2726
02:13:12,161 --> 02:13:14,260
so let me just do.
Let me just become funny.

2727
02:13:14,261 --> 02:13:19,261
And then you know,
you see a lot of funny guys that are my 

2728
02:13:19,261 --> 02:13:19,261
friends that are not good looking at 
all,

2729
02:13:19,261 --> 02:13:21,640
but have beautiful girlfriends.
Like what does that from?

2730
02:13:21,850 --> 02:13:23,620
Well,
they figured out the one thing that they

2731
02:13:23,621 --> 02:13:25,480
do have that they can find that 
attractive,

2732
02:13:25,780 --> 02:13:29,500
that data that these actors and these 
people that get,

2733
02:13:29,590 --> 02:13:32,100
that are famous,
they're getting

2734
02:13:32,100 --> 02:13:35,040
love and they're getting love from 
people that don't know them.

2735
02:13:35,370 --> 02:13:40,370
They only know their work.
They only know this thing that they've 

2736
02:13:40,370 --> 02:13:43,851
pretended to be in a movie where there 
were a superhero or in this thing where 

2737
02:13:43,851 --> 02:13:45,240
they were a doctor and that show where 
they were.

2738
02:13:45,420 --> 02:13:50,420
You know,
they always had the right answer and 

2739
02:13:50,420 --> 02:13:52,281
they were on top of things.
How many people that we've seen in 

2740
02:13:52,281 --> 02:13:52,281
movies that we thought were like really 
smart,

2741
02:13:52,281 --> 02:13:54,210
intelligent people?
Then you see them in an interview.

2742
02:13:54,211 --> 02:13:54,660
You go,
oh,

2743
02:13:54,840 --> 02:13:57,060
he's a fucking idiot.
He's an idiot.

2744
02:13:57,061 --> 02:14:02,061
He's playing a role right there.
Their data that they get is completely 

2745
02:14:02,061 --> 02:14:03,690
unnatural.
That environment Where you,

2746
02:14:04,260 --> 02:14:09,260
for whatever reason,
they decide that you're going to be the 

2747
02:14:09,260 --> 02:14:12,231
guy they put you in this thing.
They project you on a screen that's 60 

2748
02:14:12,231 --> 02:14:13,140
feet wide.
Every time you talk,

2749
02:14:13,380 --> 02:14:18,380
the words that come out of your mouth 
were carefully constructed by a team of 

2750
02:14:18,380 --> 02:14:20,730
writers and they labored over those 
words for weeks and weeks.

2751
02:14:20,940 --> 02:14:25,110
There's music playing.
I mean it's amazing exhaust,

2752
02:14:25,170 --> 02:14:28,020
so that environment is so completely 
unnatural.

2753
02:14:28,021 --> 02:14:31,020
The data that they get because of that 
is so unnatural.

2754
02:14:31,021 --> 02:14:35,040
When brad pitt shows up at a some awards
party or something like that and he goes

2755
02:14:35,041 --> 02:14:38,880
down the red carpet and people fucking 
go bananas and scream,

2756
02:14:39,120 --> 02:14:44,120
he handles it remarkably well for 
someone who's in that scenario because 

2757
02:14:44,120 --> 02:14:49,041
that is a completely unnatural scenario 
and must be insanely difficult to 

2758
02:14:49,041 --> 02:14:51,720
maintain objectivity and that's in that 
situation.

2759
02:14:51,900 --> 02:14:56,900
So that has to be taken into account.
Just the data that those people get is 

2760
02:14:56,900 --> 02:15:00,591
so different from the data that a guy 
who is working at a camera shop gets a 

2761
02:15:00,991 --> 02:15:05,070
guy that was a normal person and normal 
life that the data that they get is when

2762
02:15:05,071 --> 02:15:10,071
they interact with people,
people judge them based on their 

2763
02:15:10,071 --> 02:15:10,071
appearance,
how they talk,

2764
02:15:10,140 --> 02:15:11,220
what their background is.

2765
02:15:11,220 --> 02:15:13,350
They start communicating,
they gather up data.

2766
02:15:13,650 --> 02:15:18,060
When you see tom cruise or brad pitt,
like you automatically like them.

2767
02:15:18,330 --> 02:15:23,330
You automatically have all this attached
to them and that's a totally unnatural 

2768
02:15:23,330 --> 02:15:25,920
world to live in.
There is actually some studies that have

2769
02:15:25,921 --> 02:15:30,921
looked at Why is it that people love 
celebrities so much and the argument is 

2770
02:15:32,580 --> 02:15:36,000
that it's because it's tricking our 
ancestral brain,

2771
02:15:36,030 --> 02:15:38,610
right?
You're coming into my television,

2772
02:15:38,710 --> 02:15:43,380
a screen every day on news radio.
I actually,

2773
02:15:43,470 --> 02:15:47,870
you now become part of my what's called,
want dunbar numbers on it for $1,500.

2774
02:15:48,180 --> 02:15:50,280
Very nice.
So you know joe rogan.

2775
02:15:50,310 --> 02:15:55,310
I know this guy.
I mean I remember when my kid was 

2776
02:15:55,310 --> 02:15:55,310
blogged,
joe rogan,

2777
02:15:55,310 --> 02:15:55,310
joe,
joe.

2778
02:15:55,310 --> 02:15:57,690
I know joe rogan.
And so I think what ends up happening is

2779
02:15:57,691 --> 02:16:01,080
that since we obviously didn't evolve in
an environment where to televisions,

2780
02:16:01,470 --> 02:16:04,650
but I now feel so intimately connected 
to you,

2781
02:16:04,740 --> 02:16:06,330
that barrier is removed.

2782
02:16:06,390 --> 02:16:11,390
Yeah.
It gets even weirder when you do 

2783
02:16:11,390 --> 02:16:12,921
something like this podcast because it's
even more intimate because we're in 

2784
02:16:12,921 --> 02:16:14,730
people's ears were an earbuds.
I'm inside your head.

2785
02:16:14,760 --> 02:16:16,980
I'm talking to you right now.
Maybe you're on a treadmill,

2786
02:16:16,981 --> 02:16:19,980
maybe you're on a plane,
maybe you're sitting on the subway by my

2787
02:16:19,981 --> 02:16:23,190
books.
It's books,

2788
02:16:23,720 --> 02:16:26,130
a member,
those subliminal things that,

2789
02:16:26,131 --> 02:16:28,080
those work,
those things like buy popcorn.

2790
02:16:28,110 --> 02:16:30,780
Remember those things.
flash in the movie,

2791
02:16:30,800 --> 02:16:34,130
not famous sort of popcorn and coke.
Apparently the,

2792
02:16:34,230 --> 02:16:35,500
the,
I don't know the exact story,

2793
02:16:35,501 --> 02:16:40,330
but I think apparently the company that 
commissioned that study,

2794
02:16:40,690 --> 02:16:43,090
uh,
maybe did some massaging with.

2795
02:16:44,310 --> 02:16:47,830
I had a group of undergraduate students 
do a similar project.

2796
02:16:47,831 --> 02:16:51,190
And one of my courses,
what they found is that if you put,

2797
02:16:51,191 --> 02:16:56,191
let's say by crush or buy a big mac,
it's not specifically the desire to buy 

2798
02:16:56,681 --> 02:16:58,270
that product that increased.

2799
02:16:58,420 --> 02:17:02,150
But rather your hunger and your thirst 
increased somewhat.

2800
02:17:02,170 --> 02:17:04,360
I mean it didn't increase your 
likelihood of saying,

2801
02:17:04,361 --> 02:17:05,710
yes,
I'd like to buy a big mac,

2802
02:17:05,920 --> 02:17:08,230
but when they were asked post the 
subliminal thing,

2803
02:17:08,350 --> 02:17:13,350
are you hungry than the subliminal cue 
would affect their hunger and their 

2804
02:17:13,350 --> 02:17:17,670
thirst but not to the specific product.
So the evidence is equivocal,

2805
02:17:18,070 --> 02:17:23,070
so there's a little something in there 
like if you see somebody eating a piece 

2806
02:17:23,070 --> 02:17:24,510
of cake on tv and it looks awesome,
you do that or like that.

2807
02:17:24,900 --> 02:17:25,930
And that's real.
Yeah,

2808
02:17:25,990 --> 02:17:30,990
exactly.
So that is kind of a subliminal message 

2809
02:17:30,990 --> 02:17:30,990
or is that not to limit because it's 
conscious.

2810
02:17:30,990 --> 02:17:34,780
It's has to be below my conscious 
awareness for it to be subliminal.

2811
02:17:35,020 --> 02:17:36,910
Do you remember those things?
They used to sell.

2812
02:17:36,911 --> 02:17:41,911
I don't think they have them anymore,
but they used to be cds or audio tapes 

2813
02:17:41,911 --> 02:17:45,040
and you would hear like the sound of the
ocean or something like that.

2814
02:17:45,220 --> 02:17:50,220
But then behind the smoking a message 
for succession and smoking so well I 

2815
02:17:50,861 --> 02:17:53,190
don't know if those work because I don't
think they are on the market anymore.

2816
02:17:53,191 --> 02:17:55,660
I know.
I think the market has spoken.

2817
02:17:57,010 --> 02:17:57,720
Yeah,
they were.

2818
02:17:57,750 --> 02:18:00,250
They were quite popular for awhile.
You hear like.

2819
02:18:01,100 --> 02:18:01,590
Yeah,
yeah,

2820
02:18:01,600 --> 02:18:02,300
yeah,
yeah.

2821
02:18:03,100 --> 02:18:06,130
Somewhere in there apparently was like,
lose weight.

2822
02:18:06,160 --> 02:18:07,450
Stop eating cheetos.
Correct.

2823
02:18:07,480 --> 02:18:09,820
Why isn't that?
Doesn't scientology have a similar thing

2824
02:18:09,821 --> 02:18:11,900
with getting the clear state or 
something?

2825
02:18:13,690 --> 02:18:16,330
I had a neighbor,
it was poor bastard.

2826
02:18:16,331 --> 02:18:21,331
There was a piece of property that he 
wanted to buy and I found out he was a 

2827
02:18:21,331 --> 02:18:24,810
scientologist because this conversation 
he wanted to buy this piece of property 

2828
02:18:24,810 --> 02:18:24,810
and I said,
yeah,

2829
02:18:24,810 --> 02:18:25,900
this is right.
It was right next to his house.

2830
02:18:25,901 --> 02:18:28,460
I said,
would you build on it?

2831
02:18:28,461 --> 02:18:29,050
And he was like,
well,

2832
02:18:29,051 --> 02:18:29,660
you know,
I don't,

2833
02:18:29,770 --> 02:18:32,530
I can't even buy it right now because my
wife was about to go clear,

2834
02:18:33,090 --> 02:18:34,360
like,
what does that mean?

2835
02:18:34,630 --> 02:18:35,710
You know,
I didn't know what it meant.

2836
02:18:35,920 --> 02:18:36,640
And he goes,
well,

2837
02:18:36,641 --> 02:18:37,840
you know,
were scientologists.

2838
02:18:37,841 --> 02:18:39,130
So and then so,
you know,

2839
02:18:39,280 --> 02:18:44,280
I tried to be as objective as possible 
and that kind of sorta started asking 

2840
02:18:44,771 --> 02:18:45,940
them like,
what does that mean?

2841
02:18:46,300 --> 02:18:51,300
He was telling me that she will no 
longer be influenced by any outside 

2842
02:18:51,300 --> 02:18:53,200
stimuli,
any outside influence,

2843
02:18:53,201 --> 02:18:58,201
any outside suggestions and that she 
will be able to go through this world 

2844
02:18:58,201 --> 02:19:02,260
without being affected by negative 
anything and anybody yelling at her,

2845
02:19:02,320 --> 02:19:04,810
anybody insulting or they will no longer
get in there,

2846
02:19:05,170 --> 02:19:07,910
but it costs $50,000.
That that's,

2847
02:19:08,040 --> 02:19:09,720
that's the ringer.
And then remember,

2848
02:19:09,760 --> 02:19:10,900
I was going like,
what is this?

2849
02:19:10,930 --> 02:19:12,820
What happens?
And he was explaining that,

2850
02:19:12,821 --> 02:19:14,770
that she goes through the ceremony and 
like,

2851
02:19:14,771 --> 02:19:17,290
that costs 50 grand.
Why does it cost us 50 grand?

2852
02:19:17,640 --> 02:19:18,970
So I don't know.
It's just,

2853
02:19:18,990 --> 02:19:19,630
uh,
you know,

2854
02:19:19,840 --> 02:19:23,290
it's worth it.
Fucking poor bastard.

2855
02:19:23,890 --> 02:19:27,070
Now why is it that so many people since 
you're in that industry,

2856
02:19:27,410 --> 02:19:28,010
is it that it

2857
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:32,570
is particularly accepted within the 
hollywood crowd crowd question.

2858
02:19:32,780 --> 02:19:36,230
I've only met a few.
I've only met a few legit scientologists

2859
02:19:36,231 --> 02:19:40,070
and one thing that they radiate.
It's this weird sort of positive energy,

2860
02:19:40,430 --> 02:19:45,430
this alien,
artificial positive energy that's very 

2861
02:19:45,430 --> 02:19:45,430
difficult to put your finger on.
Like,

2862
02:19:45,430 --> 02:19:47,270
hey,
nice to meet you man.

2863
02:19:47,271 --> 02:19:52,271
That's amazing.
So you deal in evolutionary psychology 

2864
02:19:52,271 --> 02:19:55,400
as it applies to marketing.
Amazing stuff.

2865
02:19:55,401 --> 02:19:56,960
I'm like it a lot.
Like there's something.

2866
02:19:57,290 --> 02:20:02,290
It's not like a genuine enthusiasm.
It's this weird extra level that's not,

2867
02:20:02,691 --> 02:20:06,380
but it's almost like you want to follow.
I want to see how long you can keep this

2868
02:20:06,381 --> 02:20:08,300
up.
I want to follow you all day.

2869
02:20:08,450 --> 02:20:10,850
I want to know when the crash is coming.
You know,

2870
02:20:10,851 --> 02:20:12,830
I'm pretty sure that if I followed you 
around,

2871
02:20:12,831 --> 02:20:17,831
I'm just guessing,
but based on our two hour and a half 

2872
02:20:17,831 --> 02:20:17,831
conversation that if I followed you 
around,

2873
02:20:17,831 --> 02:20:18,650
you're pretty much like this all the 
time.

2874
02:20:18,660 --> 02:20:23,660
It was you,
but when you're talking to a 

2875
02:20:23,660 --> 02:20:25,841
scientologist,
you fucking know that this is going to 

2876
02:20:25,841 --> 02:20:25,841
end.
You can't keep this up man.

2877
02:20:25,850 --> 02:20:28,030
It's like if a guy's putting on a fake 
english accent,

2878
02:20:28,040 --> 02:20:30,440
I'm talking all day like this is an 
important time.

2879
02:20:30,640 --> 02:20:33,410
We got to know that I can't do this 
forever.

2880
02:20:34,220 --> 02:20:36,470
No,
and this is something that they're doing

2881
02:20:36,471 --> 02:20:38,840
when they've got this amazing stuff.
I love it.

2882
02:20:39,110 --> 02:20:40,460
Love what you do in like,
like,

2883
02:20:40,461 --> 02:20:41,820
man,
you're going to hit the rocks brown.

2884
02:20:41,860 --> 02:20:43,760
you're going to crash.
Something's gonna go wrong.

2885
02:20:44,330 --> 02:20:47,690
But they are there centers that they 
have in la,

2886
02:20:47,691 --> 02:20:51,260
one of the most interesting ones is they
have this anti psychiatry,

2887
02:20:51,590 --> 02:20:56,590
anti psychiatry center,
psychiatry kills and they have this big 

2888
02:20:56,590 --> 02:20:59,090
billboard where the guy's got like shock
electric shock therapy,

2889
02:20:59,091 --> 02:21:01,400
shit on his head,
screaming in agony.

2890
02:21:01,760 --> 02:21:06,760
And what you don't realize when you go 
to that is that it's a scientology 

2891
02:21:06,760 --> 02:21:06,760
front.

2892
02:21:06,760 --> 02:21:08,090
I mean,
he'd go in there and they,

2893
02:21:08,091 --> 02:21:08,750
they,
you know,

2894
02:21:08,751 --> 02:21:11,280
they get you hooked on dianetics.
Wow.

2895
02:21:12,040 --> 02:21:16,310
The story of this guy is quite amazing.
He's amazing,

2896
02:21:16,670 --> 02:21:17,990
amazingly bad,
too.

2897
02:21:17,991 --> 02:21:22,991
Amazingly bad writer.
And the fact that he openly spoke about 

2898
02:21:22,991 --> 02:21:27,251
creating your own religion,
that if you want to have real power and 

2899
02:21:27,251 --> 02:21:27,251
real money,
you need to make your own religion.

2900
02:21:27,251 --> 02:21:31,760
And then made his own religion and the 
books are fucking atrocious.

2901
02:21:32,060 --> 02:21:34,010
His movie,
battlefield earth.

2902
02:21:34,011 --> 02:21:35,480
Have you ever seen the john travolta 
movie?

2903
02:21:35,500 --> 02:21:36,380
No.
Oh my god.

2904
02:21:36,381 --> 02:21:41,381
We were talking about it last week.
My friend elizA slessinger and I were 

2905
02:21:41,381 --> 02:21:44,651
laughing about it.
It's a insanely bad movie with john 

2906
02:21:44,651 --> 02:21:49,511
travolta,
who's in more of a monster giant alien 

2907
02:21:49,511 --> 02:21:50,620
guy and it's him.
And um,

2908
02:21:50,900 --> 02:21:53,600
what's the fucking dudes name with the 
lazy eye?

2909
02:21:53,601 --> 02:21:57,050
The black guy,
a forest whitaker,

2910
02:21:57,180 --> 02:21:58,650
forest forest whitaker's in it too.

2911
02:21:59,880 --> 02:22:01,970
I don't think he's the scientologists,
but he's,

2912
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:07,000
he's an alien the in this movie because 
you'd be amazed at how many 

2913
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,911
scientologists there are high level 
people and you start like looking like 

2914
02:22:10,070 --> 02:22:15,070
weird ones.
Like back the singer back is this 

2915
02:22:15,070 --> 02:22:18,460
juliette lewis is like,
as you go down the list of people that 

2916
02:22:18,460 --> 02:22:20,270
are actual scientologists is.
It's pretty extensive.

2917
02:22:20,540 --> 02:22:25,340
I think what it provides them is a 
scaffolding for,

2918
02:22:25,800 --> 02:22:30,240
I think hollywood and the idea of being 
and most notably actors,

2919
02:22:30,330 --> 02:22:33,840
because acting itself is one of the most
unstable professions.

2920
02:22:34,230 --> 02:22:35,740
You have to be chosen.
Could you.

2921
02:22:35,741 --> 02:22:40,741
I mean,
what you do is based entirely on the 

2922
02:22:40,741 --> 02:22:42,270
merits of your work.
What you do is based on entirely on your

2923
02:22:42,271 --> 02:22:44,730
education,
your qualifications,

2924
02:22:44,760 --> 02:22:45,030
the,
your,

2925
02:22:45,130 --> 02:22:50,130
your,
and the data that you've provided and 

2926
02:22:50,130 --> 02:22:50,130
the writing that you've done based on 
that data.

2927
02:22:50,130 --> 02:22:51,450
It's all really rock solid stuff.

2928
02:22:51,780 --> 02:22:56,780
So I'll right in front of you,
despite the fact that the ideologues 

2929
02:22:56,780 --> 02:22:59,400
attack you and the fucking politically 
correct knuckleheads will go after you.

2930
02:22:59,850 --> 02:23:01,440
What you're doing is,
you know,

2931
02:23:01,441 --> 02:23:02,940
it's all based on the merits of your 
work.

2932
02:23:02,970 --> 02:23:07,970
What an actor is doing is trying so 
desperately to get other people to 

2933
02:23:08,251 --> 02:23:11,380
accept them and choose them.
And it's very weird.

2934
02:23:12,280 --> 02:23:14,490
It's fleeting.
It's not just fleeting,

2935
02:23:14,520 --> 02:23:17,100
it's so.
It's so weird that they don't have their

2936
02:23:17,101 --> 02:23:22,101
own.
It's very rare that you talk to actors 

2937
02:23:22,101 --> 02:23:22,101
and they have their own opinions,
right?

2938
02:23:22,101 --> 02:23:25,340
It's like what they have is this sort of
conglomeration of opinions that they've 

2939
02:23:25,340 --> 02:23:28,860
sort of subscribe to because they 
believe that this is going to ingratiate

2940
02:23:28,861 --> 02:23:30,900
them with the overlords of hollywood.
Right?

2941
02:23:31,230 --> 02:23:33,270
So everyone has got damn politically 
correct.

2942
02:23:33,271 --> 02:23:36,390
Everyone's driving a fucking prius,
everyone's voting democrat.

2943
02:23:36,650 --> 02:23:41,650
You know,
everyone is wearing pink ribbons when 

2944
02:23:41,650 --> 02:23:41,650
it's the appropriate time because it's 
breast cancer awareness.

2945
02:23:41,760 --> 02:23:43,790
Hashtag bring our girls home.

2946
02:23:45,930 --> 02:23:47,190
Hashtag yes.
All Women.

2947
02:23:47,191 --> 02:23:49,740
You better fucking have that shit.
You better have a good quote about it.

2948
02:23:49,980 --> 02:23:53,040
Hashtag hashtag go fuck yourself.
So they all,

2949
02:23:53,460 --> 02:23:58,460
they all get up.
They become a part of this sort of 

2950
02:23:58,460 --> 02:24:01,520
really unstable and to be,
to be fame fair to someone who wants to 

2951
02:24:02,041 --> 02:24:05,880
be an actor in the first place,
oftentimes you're incredibly unstable at

2952
02:24:05,881 --> 02:24:06,460
first,
uh,

2953
02:24:06,990 --> 02:24:09,330
the original you before you get to 
hollywood,

2954
02:24:09,331 --> 02:24:10,530
like,
why do you want to be an actor?

2955
02:24:10,531 --> 02:24:13,710
Because you want to be super special,
not just regular special.

2956
02:24:13,711 --> 02:24:15,840
You want to be,
you want to be the guy.

2957
02:24:15,910 --> 02:24:20,910
I actually wanted to ask you about this 
because my theory is that very few 

2958
02:24:20,910 --> 02:24:24,240
actors want to be actors because of the 
love of the craft.

2959
02:24:24,300 --> 02:24:24,690
I Mean,
yes,

2960
02:24:24,691 --> 02:24:28,140
there's opera opportunity and robert 
deniro who really do this because,

2961
02:24:28,141 --> 02:24:28,770
you know,
they're just,

2962
02:24:28,771 --> 02:24:33,771
they're real artists,
but most people are really looking for 

2963
02:24:33,771 --> 02:24:33,771
the extrinsic brooks.

2964
02:24:33,771 --> 02:24:38,030
Right.
It's really cool for me to walk around 

2965
02:24:38,030 --> 02:24:38,030
and people throwing themselves off 
balconies when I,

2966
02:24:38,030 --> 02:24:38,760
when I make an appearance,
right?

2967
02:24:38,840 --> 02:24:39,760
Yeah.
To make tons of money.

2968
02:24:39,930 --> 02:24:42,120
So would,
would you agree that that's true?

2969
02:24:42,121 --> 02:24:43,950
I mean,
is that it's a sickness.

2970
02:24:43,951 --> 02:24:44,400
It's,
you know,

2971
02:24:44,401 --> 02:24:44,750
the,
the,

2972
02:24:44,751 --> 02:24:47,740
there's a lot of people they see like a 
guy like uh,

2973
02:24:48,090 --> 02:24:51,300
go back to brad pitt for instance,
they see the love that brad pitt gets.

2974
02:24:51,301 --> 02:24:56,301
They want to be like him and what's the 
best way to be like him to do what he 

2975
02:24:56,301 --> 02:24:56,340
does.
And so what does he do?

2976
02:24:56,530 --> 02:24:57,720
He acts.
How hard is that?

2977
02:24:57,721 --> 02:24:59,310
It's just Pretending I'm going to get an
acting,

2978
02:24:59,590 --> 02:25:00,930
you know,
they just want,

2979
02:25:01,110 --> 02:25:03,720
they have a hole in their soul.
They need to fill up with other people's

2980
02:25:03,721 --> 02:25:07,380
attention and almost all of them that 
are like really extremely successful had

2981
02:25:07,381 --> 02:25:09,180
some fucking wacky childhood.

2982
02:25:09,420 --> 02:25:11,760
For me personally,
I had a very bad childhood.

2983
02:25:11,830 --> 02:25:13,270
It was not good,
you know,

2984
02:25:13,290 --> 02:25:16,110
and because of that bad child,
it wasn't the worst.

2985
02:25:16,111 --> 02:25:17,760
I have friends that have way worse 
childhoods,

2986
02:25:17,761 --> 02:25:22,761
but it was enough to create a deficit 
that I had this burning desire to fill 

2987
02:25:22,990 --> 02:25:24,910
in,
to show that I wasn't a loser.

2988
02:25:25,110 --> 02:25:25,450
Right.
You know,

2989
02:25:25,510 --> 02:25:27,130
there wasn't,
there wasn't this,

2990
02:25:27,500 --> 02:25:32,500
this child who is ignored and treated 
like shit that I wasn't that,

2991
02:25:33,190 --> 02:25:34,700
that I'll show you,
you know,

2992
02:25:34,701 --> 02:25:39,430
and that I'll show you is what sort of 
getting fame by becoming or being graded

2993
02:25:39,431 --> 02:25:44,431
athletics.
I mean that's what initially led me to 

2994
02:25:44,431 --> 02:25:44,431
fighting.
That's what initially led me to comedy.

2995
02:25:44,440 --> 02:25:49,440
It wasn't as much I'll get fame is I'll 
show you like I'm going to get great at 

2996
02:25:49,440 --> 02:25:54,361
something.
And then somewhere along the line I 

2997
02:25:54,361 --> 02:25:54,361
started acting.
It was.

2998
02:25:54,361 --> 02:25:54,361
But that was completely by accident.

2999
02:25:54,630 --> 02:25:55,360
They,
I never,

3000
02:25:55,780 --> 02:26:00,780
yeah,
never taken any acting classes or 

3001
02:26:00,780 --> 02:26:01,000
anything like that.
I just got a development deal because of

3002
02:26:01,001 --> 02:26:06,001
standup comedy and I took a handful of 
private one-on-one acting classes with a

3003
02:26:06,941 --> 02:26:08,530
crazy person.
Oh,

3004
02:26:08,531 --> 02:26:12,520
This crazy lady who was constantly 
trying to get me to.

3005
02:26:12,700 --> 02:26:17,500
If I did get a show to cast her as my 
mother working her way in.

3006
02:26:17,560 --> 02:26:18,790
Oh,
so gross.

3007
02:26:19,380 --> 02:26:23,350
She conversations that I had with this 
lady was so brutal and it sort of like,

3008
02:26:23,440 --> 02:26:27,130
it was one of the first interactions 
that I had ever had with someone who has

3009
02:26:27,430 --> 02:26:32,430
deep,
deep in the acting world and the 

3010
02:26:32,430 --> 02:26:34,231
business and I got to be around some of 
these people that were also taking her 

3011
02:26:34,231 --> 02:26:34,231
classes.
I'm like,

3012
02:26:34,231 --> 02:26:38,480
you people are fucking grills.
There's something gross about the just 

3013
02:26:38,480 --> 02:26:41,120
the disingenuous behavior.
Yeah,

3014
02:26:41,350 --> 02:26:42,160
but I,
again,

3015
02:26:42,161 --> 02:26:47,161
as we said,
I think it all boils down to like what 

3016
02:26:47,161 --> 02:26:47,161
is that world?

3017
02:26:47,161 --> 02:26:51,120
So are many of your personal friends in 
the industry or are they more in 

3018
02:26:51,120 --> 02:26:52,480
fighting or.
Most of them are comedians.

3019
02:26:52,510 --> 02:26:57,510
I'm mostly.
My good friends are stand up comics 

3020
02:26:57,510 --> 02:26:58,000
because standup comics is like.
And the other ones are martial artists.

3021
02:26:58,060 --> 02:27:03,060
Those,
those two worlds are there as solid as 

3022
02:27:03,060 --> 02:27:03,060
he can get.
Like if you're not funny,

3023
02:27:03,060 --> 02:27:04,900
no one laughs.
If you don't know how to fight,

3024
02:27:04,901 --> 02:27:06,530
you're going to get your ass kicked,
if you.

3025
02:27:06,740 --> 02:27:08,530
You know what I mean?
Even if you don't know,

3026
02:27:08,620 --> 02:27:10,510
if you don't know jujitsu,
someone's going to strangle you.

3027
02:27:10,820 --> 02:27:11,530
If you,
you know,

3028
02:27:11,560 --> 02:27:16,560
these were all rock solid world.
There's no no getting around them where 

3029
02:27:16,560 --> 02:27:20,101
things get weird and airy.
Fairy is when you're pretending to be a 

3030
02:27:20,101 --> 02:27:20,200
superhero,
you know,

3031
02:27:20,201 --> 02:27:22,590
or you're pretending to be a.
Just think it's a.

3032
02:27:22,660 --> 02:27:27,660
It's an unnatural position to be in and 
for human beings as you were saying,

3033
02:27:28,390 --> 02:27:32,900
we have this evolutionary trait where we
look at successful behavior.

3034
02:27:32,900 --> 02:27:34,030
We want to emulate it.
Well,

3035
02:27:34,031 --> 02:27:35,860
if you find the guy who's the head of 
the tribe,

3036
02:27:36,130 --> 02:27:41,130
who's got the scars and the wisdom,
that's the guy that you want to pay 

3037
02:27:41,130 --> 02:27:44,881
attention to because you can learn from 
other people's mistakes and he shows 

3038
02:27:44,881 --> 02:27:45,610
wisdom.
You can emulate his behavior and you can

3039
02:27:45,611 --> 02:27:47,020
become successful.
Well,

3040
02:27:47,080 --> 02:27:52,060
when someone is on tv and slash or in a 
movie theater in their heads for 60 feet

3041
02:27:52,120 --> 02:27:54,610
tall and they're.
Everything they're saying is perfect,

3042
02:27:54,910 --> 02:27:56,650
you want to be them.
You know,

3043
02:27:56,651 --> 02:28:01,651
you want to follow them.
you want to worship them because they 

3044
02:28:01,651 --> 02:28:02,890
seem to be exhibiting this evolutionary 
thing.

3045
02:28:02,891 --> 02:28:07,891
And also think that the media itself,
whether it's music or whether it's 

3046
02:28:07,891 --> 02:28:09,330
movies and television,
there,

3047
02:28:09,790 --> 02:28:14,790
there's an inescapable quality to being 
on film that is unavoidable and some 

3048
02:28:16,631 --> 02:28:21,010
very strange way and that your body's 
not designed to absorb.

3049
02:28:21,770 --> 02:28:24,080
Your body is not designed to absorb 
movies.

3050
02:28:24,081 --> 02:28:29,081
Your body's absorbed,
designed to absorb the wisdom of the 

3051
02:28:29,081 --> 02:28:29,270
natural world.
Like the wisdom of,

3052
02:28:29,450 --> 02:28:34,450
you know,
that guy got bitten by a is to have the 

3053
02:28:34,450 --> 02:28:34,450
tall grass.
You know,

3054
02:28:34,450 --> 02:28:34,450
it's real fucking simple.
You know,

3055
02:28:34,450 --> 02:28:34,450
like,
oh,

3056
02:28:34,450 --> 02:28:36,530
he went in the river and he drowned or 
don't go in the river.

3057
02:28:36,740 --> 02:28:41,740
You know,
all these lessons we learned from the 

3058
02:28:41,740 --> 02:28:43,811
natural world.
All these things that we see that exist 

3059
02:28:43,811 --> 02:28:44,630
in the material world that's in front of
us.

3060
02:28:44,840 --> 02:28:49,840
But when this world is all of a sudden 
been changed and now you're looking at 

3061
02:28:49,840 --> 02:28:54,041
dragons and you're looking at the 
spaceships and fucking lightning bolts 

3062
02:28:54,041 --> 02:28:56,420
and all these things that are taking 
place on a screen that aren't real,

3063
02:28:56,630 --> 02:28:59,240
the whole thing gets very squirrely in 
our minds.

3064
02:28:59,270 --> 02:29:03,380
We don't know what to do with it.
So do you ever get blow backs?

3065
02:29:03,380 --> 02:29:04,820
As we were talking about blowback about 
being,

3066
02:29:05,200 --> 02:29:10,200
you get blowback from people in the 
industry for speaking so critically of 

3067
02:29:10,200 --> 02:29:11,510
the hollywood types.
They're scared,

3068
02:29:11,630 --> 02:29:16,630
especially actors,
terrified to have an opinion on 

3069
02:29:16,630 --> 02:29:19,121
anything.
They opinion on someone shitting on 

3070
02:29:19,121 --> 02:29:19,440
actors because the problem is then it 
would be exposed.

3071
02:29:19,450 --> 02:29:20,510
People would start examining,
well,

3072
02:29:20,511 --> 02:29:25,511
let's examine your behalf.
Let's examine what actors really what's 

3073
02:29:25,511 --> 02:29:28,330
examined.
Some of the things you said know they 

3074
02:29:28,330 --> 02:29:28,330
probably get mad.
Fuck him,

3075
02:29:28,330 --> 02:29:28,330
but I'm not going to say it.
You know,

3076
02:29:28,330 --> 02:29:30,350
you won't get access on this show.
I've had actors on the show.

3077
02:29:30,351 --> 02:29:32,450
There's not all actors.
It's like saying.

3078
02:29:32,510 --> 02:29:35,330
I mean all of a lot of comedians are 
fucked up,

3079
02:29:35,331 --> 02:29:38,420
but it's not all comedians.
A lot of fighters are fucked up,

3080
02:29:38,630 --> 02:29:43,630
but not all of them.
I mean there's a lot of actors that are 

3081
02:29:43,630 --> 02:29:45,641
really nice and I've done some,
like I've done movies with people like 

3082
02:29:45,641 --> 02:29:47,120
rosario dawson who's beautiful and 
famous.

3083
02:29:47,120 --> 02:29:50,420
She's about as nice and normal as you're
ever going to be around.

3084
02:29:50,690 --> 02:29:53,120
She's so cool.
Like when you're around her,

3085
02:29:53,280 --> 02:29:56,180
you would never believe in a million 
years that she's famous.

3086
02:29:56,330 --> 02:29:59,480
She seems completely unaffected by 
whatever mechanism.

3087
02:29:59,481 --> 02:30:02,660
I don't know how she got to fake modest.
She's totally normal,

3088
02:30:02,830 --> 02:30:07,830
which I wish I had a video of her 
playing with my daughter when my 

3089
02:30:07,830 --> 02:30:08,240
daughter was two.
It was hilarious.

3090
02:30:08,540 --> 02:30:11,510
She was grabbing her and like stuffing 
her whole hand or mouth.

3091
02:30:11,520 --> 02:30:14,270
My daughter would scream laughing and 
she kept doing it again.

3092
02:30:14,660 --> 02:30:16,340
It was so funny.
She's really funny.

3093
02:30:16,341 --> 02:30:19,460
My daughter was crying at the monster 
outside of the werewolf.

3094
02:30:19,660 --> 02:30:21,830
Sorry man.
I should've worn you.

3095
02:30:22,460 --> 02:30:25,110
I didn't know you got to bring kids some
motherfucker.

3096
02:30:25,240 --> 02:30:28,520
I know there's a lot of nice people that
are actors,

3097
02:30:28,550 --> 02:30:31,340
like there's a lot of nice people.
I'm sure they do all sorts of things.

3098
02:30:31,340 --> 02:30:34,130
I know a lot of dudes that are in 
special forces that are nice as hell.

3099
02:30:34,340 --> 02:30:35,690
Right.
And they've killed folks.

3100
02:30:35,840 --> 02:30:38,000
You know?
It'S like there's a lot of nice people.

3101
02:30:38,180 --> 02:30:41,180
I got a last year when we came to 
California.

3102
02:30:41,330 --> 02:30:46,330
We come here every year to vacation.
I don't know if you knew it was the 

3103
02:30:46,330 --> 02:30:46,330
wrong time.
Why don't you come to winteR?

3104
02:30:46,470 --> 02:30:48,890
You live in montreal?
We.

3105
02:30:49,370 --> 02:30:54,370
I was at uc irvine for a couple years 
and then headed back to montreal and 

3106
02:30:54,370 --> 02:30:56,180
I've been trying to get back to 
California that winter is a motherfucker

3107
02:30:56,181 --> 02:30:56,920
up there.
What?

3108
02:30:57,180 --> 02:30:58,370
You had been to montreal.
Oh yeah,

3109
02:30:58,371 --> 02:30:59,630
many times.
Yeah.

3110
02:30:59,690 --> 02:31:01,370
Well shaw sent piano I guess.
Yeah,

3111
02:31:01,371 --> 02:31:06,371
well I grew up in boston and I used to 
do comedy at the montreal comedy 

3112
02:31:06,371 --> 02:31:06,371
festival every year.
Oh,

3113
02:31:06,371 --> 02:31:07,070
there you go.
Yeah.

3114
02:31:07,071 --> 02:31:09,950
Which is happening soon.
I guess every summer I used to go.

3115
02:31:09,951 --> 02:31:12,410
I started going up there and I think 92,
so.

3116
02:31:12,411 --> 02:31:17,411
Oh cool.
So you were saying about the special 

3117
02:31:17,411 --> 02:31:17,411
forces.
So we,

3118
02:31:17,411 --> 02:31:19,911
you know,
we always hang out at one of the 

3119
02:31:19,911 --> 02:31:19,911
beaches.
We meet people,

3120
02:31:19,911 --> 02:31:19,911
we chat,
you know,

3121
02:31:19,911 --> 02:31:20,160
we were very friendly and so met a guy 
who's,

3122
02:31:20,280 --> 02:31:25,280
he's become now a very good friend,
a fbi special agent whose job it is to 

3123
02:31:26,460 --> 02:31:31,460
tailgate all of these muslim extremists 
around uc irvine area won't tailgate 

3124
02:31:33,511 --> 02:31:34,260
them.
Well,

3125
02:31:34,261 --> 02:31:36,600
yeah.
I'm not going to be upset that I said,

3126
02:31:36,710 --> 02:31:39,190
well I have no worries.
Uh,

3127
02:31:39,360 --> 02:31:40,170
so yeah.
So,

3128
02:31:40,171 --> 02:31:41,010
uh,
so he's,

3129
02:31:41,070 --> 02:31:46,070
he's,
he's told me some unbelievable stories 

3130
02:31:46,070 --> 02:31:46,070
of,
and he,

3131
02:31:46,070 --> 02:31:46,070
he too,
I mean,

3132
02:31:46,070 --> 02:31:50,661
he was an fbi agent who has been under a
lot of pressure to do the politically 

3133
02:31:50,661 --> 02:31:54,921
correct thing,
right as you probably know that you're 

3134
02:31:54,921 --> 02:31:56,450
not supposed to say islamic extremists 
or islam or this or that.

3135
02:31:56,790 --> 02:31:59,670
And so when he hears me in some of my 
discourse,

3136
02:31:59,671 --> 02:32:04,671
he finds it quite liberating because 
here's a guy who was sort of whose job 

3137
02:32:04,671 --> 02:32:08,931
it is to protect us from some of these 
dangers who faces some of the 

3138
02:32:08,931 --> 02:32:10,930
politically correct shackles that we've 
been talking about.

3139
02:32:11,010 --> 02:32:13,110
We're all To our mutual friend sam 
harris.

3140
02:32:13,111 --> 02:32:18,111
Yes.
Has had an incredible amount of blow 

3141
02:32:18,111 --> 02:32:20,841
back in his honest and objective 
assessment of muslim extreme extremists 

3142
02:32:20,841 --> 02:32:25,401
credible.
The muslim extremists that he's 

3143
02:32:25,401 --> 02:32:27,950
documented that he is put on his blog.
Like he had this thing where he was 

3144
02:32:28,711 --> 02:32:30,100
saying like,
um,

3145
02:32:30,160 --> 02:32:30,760
there's,
there's a,

3146
02:32:30,770 --> 02:32:33,960
there's a video of this guy who's 
speaking.

3147
02:32:34,280 --> 02:32:35,730
Um,
I forget what country he's in,

3148
02:32:35,731 --> 02:32:40,410
but he's speaking in english to this 
group of islamic people.

3149
02:32:40,560 --> 02:32:45,560
And he's talking about the differences 
between what people think of them as 

3150
02:32:45,560 --> 02:32:48,320
radical islam and what is just islam.
Right?

3151
02:32:48,420 --> 02:32:49,890
And he starts talking about,
he goes,

3152
02:32:49,891 --> 02:32:53,880
how many of you believe in the works of 
the koran,

3153
02:32:53,940 --> 02:32:57,150
in the word of the koran,
and in how many of you follow it?

3154
02:32:57,151 --> 02:33:01,410
And they all raised their hand.
How many of you believe that the word of

3155
02:33:01,411 --> 02:33:06,411
god is the best way to deal with 
homosexuals and that whatever the koran 

3156
02:33:07,381 --> 02:33:12,381
says,
whether they it says they should be 

3157
02:33:12,381 --> 02:33:12,381
stoned to death,
that this is the word of god and this is

3158
02:33:12,381 --> 02:33:12,381
the.

3159
02:33:12,381 --> 02:33:17,250
And they don't raise their hand.
And like he goes into this thing about 

3160
02:33:17,250 --> 02:33:19,290
how many of you think that women should 
be silent and then they should.

3161
02:33:19,340 --> 02:33:22,320
You should listen to their man because 
this is what god has said.

3162
02:33:22,321 --> 02:33:23,640
And they all raised their hand and he's 
like,

3163
02:33:23,641 --> 02:33:24,270
see,
this is,

3164
02:33:24,480 --> 02:33:27,240
this is not radical islam.
This is just islam.

3165
02:33:27,241 --> 02:33:29,040
So all these people that say,
oh,

3166
02:33:29,100 --> 02:33:30,720
is so radical,
the radical islam.

3167
02:33:30,960 --> 02:33:35,640
And like he doesn't even realize that 
he's demonstrating radical islam.

3168
02:33:35,690 --> 02:33:40,690
Exactly.
He's demonstrating sam harris got so 

3169
02:33:40,690 --> 02:33:41,160
much fucking hate just for putting this 
video up.

3170
02:33:41,570 --> 02:33:42,630
I saw all these people.
Oh,

3171
02:33:42,631 --> 02:33:44,300
I see what you're doing.
Shielding your,

3172
02:33:44,301 --> 02:33:48,380
his islamophobic with one person and 
it's your islamophobia.

3173
02:33:48,381 --> 02:33:48,430
Yeah.

3174
02:33:48,630 --> 02:33:50,510
What's astonishing is that you know,
he,

3175
02:33:50,550 --> 02:33:52,730
he is a true liberal.
Yes.

3176
02:33:52,790 --> 02:33:56,390
And yet he is painted to be some hate 
monger.

3177
02:33:56,750 --> 02:34:01,750
Well,
he also gets painted that way because 

3178
02:34:01,750 --> 02:34:02,690
it's perceived that he supports war 
because he wants to,

3179
02:34:03,100 --> 02:34:06,410
to suppress this aspect of,
of humanity.

3180
02:34:06,411 --> 02:34:07,360
And why is it?
Well,

3181
02:34:07,361 --> 02:34:09,780
it's because it's not over here yet.
If it was over here,

3182
02:34:09,810 --> 02:34:13,460
it was invading and you were getting 
suicide bombs on a daily basis,

3183
02:34:13,461 --> 02:34:14,810
you would have a real issue with it too.

3184
02:34:14,950 --> 02:34:16,900
I'll tell you a great story.
Uh,

3185
02:34:17,200 --> 02:34:21,040
those lines.
A woman approached me who was used to be

3186
02:34:21,041 --> 02:34:22,840
a friend.
Now she no longer is a friend.

3187
02:34:23,480 --> 02:34:25,810
You'll know by the end of the story why 
she said,

3188
02:34:25,850 --> 02:34:27,280
you know,
you know a lot about this issue.

3189
02:34:27,281 --> 02:34:28,630
God,
you grew up in the region.

3190
02:34:28,890 --> 02:34:33,890
Uh,
what is the position on islam regarding 

3191
02:34:33,890 --> 02:34:33,890
jews?
Okay.

3192
02:34:33,890 --> 02:34:38,130
Well,
I mean we escaped Lebanon because we 

3193
02:34:38,130 --> 02:34:38,130
were going to be executed.
Okay,

3194
02:34:38,130 --> 02:34:39,130
bye.
It wasn't by the amish.

3195
02:34:39,180 --> 02:34:40,360
Okay.
Uh,

3196
02:34:40,361 --> 02:34:41,170
so I said,
you know what,

3197
02:34:41,200 --> 02:34:43,120
rather than kind of go into a whole 
treaties,

3198
02:34:43,121 --> 02:34:47,080
here's what I'm going to do.
I'm going to share with you a montage of

3199
02:34:47,130 --> 02:34:50,290
a moms from around the world.
So this is not the culture specific.

3200
02:34:50,291 --> 02:34:52,500
There's the indonesian and malaysian,
Kuwait,

3201
02:34:52,501 --> 02:34:55,540
the yemeni.
So these are at their sermons.

3202
02:34:55,541 --> 02:35:00,541
This is at the mosque where they are 
preaching what should be done to the 

3203
02:35:00,541 --> 02:35:00,541
jews.

3204
02:35:00,550 --> 02:35:02,660
And one of the particular,
uh,

3205
02:35:03,030 --> 02:35:08,030
iSlam's was showing images of the nazis 
bulldozing a skeleton's into the ditches

3206
02:35:09,820 --> 02:35:11,680
and he was lamenting to god,
why?

3207
02:35:11,681 --> 02:35:16,681
God,
why didn't you give us the pleasure of 

3208
02:35:16,681 --> 02:35:17,860
exterminating those jewish routes?
Why do you hate us so much?

3209
02:35:17,861 --> 02:35:20,470
Jewish rats have some version of that.
Right?

3210
02:35:20,620 --> 02:35:23,170
So maybe it was even by that standard 
was diabolical.

3211
02:35:23,171 --> 02:35:28,171
So I share with her the link and I make,
I made absolutely no interpretation is 

3212
02:35:28,171 --> 02:35:28,570
right.
I wasn't saying it's good,

3213
02:35:28,571 --> 02:35:30,250
it's bad.
I just shared the link.

3214
02:35:30,910 --> 02:35:35,910
Now she's a jewish woman whose 
grandparents I can't remember on which 

3215
02:35:35,910 --> 02:35:39,661
side had had suffered in the holocaust.
She her response back to me,

3216
02:35:40,030 --> 02:35:42,670
well,
in you sharing this video,

3217
02:35:42,760 --> 02:35:47,760
you're exhibiting the same extremism so 
so when your moral compass is so broken 

3218
02:35:50,410 --> 02:35:55,410
that the guy who shares a video in 
response to a question that you asked me

3219
02:35:57,010 --> 02:36:02,010
is no different than the people who are 
generating the content in the video.

3220
02:36:02,980 --> 02:36:07,980
We're doomed.
We need a better term for political 

3221
02:36:07,980 --> 02:36:07,980
correctness

3222
02:36:07,980 --> 02:36:09,430
because that's even more extreme than 
political correctness.

3223
02:36:09,431 --> 02:36:13,270
This denial of reality based on your own
ideology and that's what it is.

3224
02:36:13,271 --> 02:36:18,271
It's just this crazy sickness that in 
people who consider themselves 

3225
02:36:18,271 --> 02:36:19,420
intelligent,
intellectual,

3226
02:36:19,421 --> 02:36:20,740
progressive,
open minded,

3227
02:36:21,010 --> 02:36:23,150
these are the people that exhibit this 
ridiculous train

3228
02:36:23,200 --> 02:36:28,200
because I think they just have this 
instinct that to criticize an other is 

3229
02:36:28,200 --> 02:36:33,120
gauche is wrong,
especially when that other is their 

3230
02:36:33,151 --> 02:36:34,130
religious views,
but

3231
02:36:34,130 --> 02:36:39,130
is that true because they have no 
problem criticizing the heck public and 

3232
02:36:39,130 --> 02:36:40,920
senator who believes in creationism and 
wants to teach it in school.

3233
02:36:40,921 --> 02:36:43,610
They're fucking hate to the end of time 
about that fool.

3234
02:36:43,730 --> 02:36:46,520
That's true,
but if it's some in mom who thinks that,

3235
02:36:46,580 --> 02:36:51,580
you know,
women should cover themselves up like 

3236
02:36:51,580 --> 02:36:51,590
they look like jabba the hut or what was
the boba fett,

3237
02:36:51,920 --> 02:36:54,230
whichever one,
whatever it is,

3238
02:36:54,260 --> 02:36:56,720
please direct your hate mail to joe 
rogan.

3239
02:36:56,740 --> 02:36:58,400
Come coming,
bringing on benches.

3240
02:36:58,870 --> 02:37:02,430
It's silliness.
It's my silliness is not.

3241
02:37:03,240 --> 02:37:08,240
I almost have more disdain for the 
people that are progressive that have an

3242
02:37:08,781 --> 02:37:13,781
issue with someone criticizing this.
Then I do the people that were 

3243
02:37:13,781 --> 02:37:17,201
brainwashed and ingrained with religion 
because these,

3244
02:37:17,380 --> 02:37:21,860
the people that are supposedly 
intellectuals are supposedly responsible

3245
02:37:21,861 --> 02:37:23,870
for guiding the thought of the young 
people,

3246
02:37:23,871 --> 02:37:28,871
the people that are supposed to be the 
folks that are the ones that are the 

3247
02:37:29,181 --> 02:37:34,181
curators of these ideas,
the ones that are the ones who are 

3248
02:37:34,181 --> 02:37:37,601
teaching children in school.
There's these are the wise ones who are 

3249
02:37:37,601 --> 02:37:41,021
professionally intelligent.
You're supposed to be professionally 

3250
02:37:41,021 --> 02:37:44,381
objective professionally wise and you 
have this ridiculous notion because of 

3251
02:37:45,020 --> 02:37:49,010
the environment that we live in,
where this politically correct,

3252
02:37:49,070 --> 02:37:53,210
whatever you wanna call it,
ideology has has gotten so infected.

3253
02:37:53,211 --> 02:37:57,670
It's such a bizarre computer virus of 
the mind blow the king of these,

3254
02:37:57,700 --> 02:37:58,370
these guys.
Yeah.

3255
02:37:58,420 --> 02:38:01,870
Although it has nothing to do with islam
as a noam chomsky.

3256
02:38:02,500 --> 02:38:04,140
I don't know if you know much about.
Sure.

3257
02:38:04,320 --> 02:38:04,870
Yeah.
I mean,

3258
02:38:04,900 --> 02:38:09,900
I,
I jokingly play a game called the six 

3259
02:38:09,900 --> 02:38:12,571
degrees of separation of noam chomsky.
So I give you a calamity and in six 

3260
02:38:12,571 --> 02:38:17,280
causal links,
you have to link it back to why the us 

3261
02:38:17,280 --> 02:38:17,280
is evil.
So,

3262
02:38:17,290 --> 02:38:17,840
you know,
an,

3263
02:38:17,910 --> 02:38:22,910
a,
an amazonian frog died in six causal 

3264
02:38:22,910 --> 02:38:26,521
links or less.
You have to tell me why it is the fault 

3265
02:38:26,521 --> 02:38:29,521
of the us military industrial complex as
to why that frog that because he used 

3266
02:38:29,521 --> 02:38:31,480
the whole world through very,
very,

3267
02:38:31,820 --> 02:38:32,740
uh,
you know,

3268
02:38:32,810 --> 02:38:35,200
a myopic lens,
right?

3269
02:38:35,460 --> 02:38:38,370
A hamas is nice.
Uh,

3270
02:38:38,440 --> 02:38:41,830
Israel is a evil apartheid,
racist state,

3271
02:38:41,831 --> 02:38:45,580
and you think this is a jewish guy who 
was spewing this from his,

3272
02:38:45,850 --> 02:38:49,750
uh,
safety of his confines in mit office.

3273
02:38:50,170 --> 02:38:55,170
Now I grew up in that world.
I promise you they're not going to take 

3274
02:38:55,170 --> 02:38:55,350
too kindly to you,
uh,

3275
02:38:55,420 --> 02:38:57,160
when the lights are off.
And so it's just,

3276
02:38:57,310 --> 02:38:59,070
it really is amazing to kind of 
understand,

3277
02:38:59,260 --> 02:39:02,170
understand the schizophrenia position or
for example,

3278
02:39:02,171 --> 02:39:04,080
queers for palestine is another one,
right?

3279
02:39:04,660 --> 02:39:05,710
Palestine.
Yeah,

3280
02:39:06,160 --> 02:39:08,710
that's,
that's a huge movement.

3281
02:39:08,711 --> 02:39:11,410
I need a t shirt.
Queers for palestine t show.

3282
02:39:11,411 --> 02:39:16,411
It's fine if they have a cafe press.
Which area in the middle east can you be

3283
02:39:17,470 --> 02:39:20,380
opened and assume your sexual 
orientation?

3284
02:39:20,590 --> 02:39:21,780
It's an Israel.
Yes.

3285
02:39:21,890 --> 02:39:26,890
Yet what's going to happen to you in 
some of those other areas is not going 

3286
02:39:26,890 --> 02:39:31,381
to be very pretty,
and yet these people are able to 

3287
02:39:31,381 --> 02:39:31,381
completely disassociate from that 
reality.

3288
02:39:31,381 --> 02:39:33,040
It's like uncle tom's.
Right,

3289
02:39:33,110 --> 02:39:35,050
right.
It's kind of along those lines,

3290
02:39:35,890 --> 02:39:36,460
I suppose

3291
02:39:36,740 --> 02:39:38,000
a way that.
Yeah,

3292
02:39:38,001 --> 02:39:41,720
the,
the idea that for whatever reason,

3293
02:39:41,910 --> 02:39:45,980
this one religion is the one that you're
not supposed to criticize.

3294
02:39:46,280 --> 02:39:51,280
I don't understand how that happened.
I wonder if it's connected in some way 

3295
02:39:51,280 --> 02:39:53,270
to the suppression of the people that 
live in these places.

3296
02:39:53,271 --> 02:39:56,870
Where are natural resources is being 
stolen by the war machine,

3297
02:39:57,170 --> 02:39:59,000
which is undeniable,
undeniable.

3298
02:39:59,001 --> 02:40:02,510
What's going on in Iraq or Afghanistan?
How much of it,

3299
02:40:02,511 --> 02:40:04,610
how much of the hustle has to do with 
the natural resources,

3300
02:40:04,611 --> 02:40:09,611
whether they be the poppy fields,
whether it be the minerals in 

3301
02:40:09,611 --> 02:40:09,611
Afghanistan,
whether it's the oil in Iraq,

3302
02:40:09,611 --> 02:40:14,440
the undeniable that these people are 
being sure for sure they're are subject 

3303
02:40:14,440 --> 02:40:16,770
to the war machine that's coming in to 
steal the resources.

3304
02:40:16,790 --> 02:40:17,500
Right,
and that,

3305
02:40:17,510 --> 02:40:22,510
that that's,
that's something that people are aware 

3306
02:40:22,510 --> 02:40:26,091
of and you see these images of these 
people and these islamic countries that 

3307
02:40:26,091 --> 02:40:30,561
are dying,
they're getting bombed on and and also 

3308
02:40:30,561 --> 02:40:33,561
the dea humanism that they're subjected 
to by a lot of people that are trying to

3309
02:40:33,721 --> 02:40:35,880
justify this,
these wars,

3310
02:40:36,210 --> 02:40:41,210
that,
that is the only thing that makes sense 

3311
02:40:41,210 --> 02:40:41,210
to me.
And also the fact that this has happened

3312
02:40:41,210 --> 02:40:46,131
over the course of since 2001.
This is when this anti islamophobia 

3313
02:40:47,580 --> 02:40:51,270
notion has been really,
really pushed harder and harder.

3314
02:40:51,620 --> 02:40:53,480
Well,
I think it's also because that's the way

3315
02:40:53,481 --> 02:40:58,481
that I demonstrate how tolerant and 
progressive I am by showing that I am 

3316
02:40:58,481 --> 02:41:02,330
not going to lump everybody with those 
crazy nine slash 11 people.

3317
02:41:02,630 --> 02:41:07,630
And so again,
it's part of that progressive posing a 

3318
02:41:07,630 --> 02:41:11,050
no ideology,
no belief system is free from mockery 

3319
02:41:11,660 --> 02:41:15,560
from criticism.
And the quicker we find that out and the

3320
02:41:15,561 --> 02:41:18,320
quicker we fixed this problem,
the better we'll be off.

3321
02:41:18,440 --> 02:41:22,320
Do you think that that's possible?
I mean this is the internet in this is.

3322
02:41:22,330 --> 02:41:27,330
This is where it gets really weird.
His internet is supposedly where the 

3323
02:41:27,330 --> 02:41:28,670
ideas come out.
You know what I mean?

3324
02:41:28,880 --> 02:41:30,650
This is the,
the age of information.

3325
02:41:30,651 --> 02:41:33,350
This is where it's all on the table.
So you're saying is it,

3326
02:41:33,470 --> 02:41:38,470
is it is going to be possible to 
suppress criticisms of islam for much 

3327
02:41:38,470 --> 02:41:38,990
longer?
Yeah.

3328
02:41:39,090 --> 02:41:41,710
Is it going to be possible to keep up 
this ridiculous facade?

3329
02:41:41,760 --> 02:41:42,540
Well,
I think,

3330
02:41:42,720 --> 02:41:47,720
I think one of the ways that you 
suppress it is by creating an ethos of 

3331
02:41:47,911 --> 02:41:49,740
self censorship.
So,

3332
02:41:50,790 --> 02:41:55,790
so if I open up my laptop and I can 
write on my psychology today,

3333
02:41:56,971 --> 02:41:58,410
blog,
the 3 million people,

3334
02:41:58,500 --> 02:42:00,990
I have a real clear choice to make that 
day.

3335
02:42:01,290 --> 02:42:06,060
Am I going to write something that can 
bring heat to my young children?

3336
02:42:06,450 --> 02:42:08,700
And then I have to decide whether I'm 
willing to do that or not.

3337
02:42:08,970 --> 02:42:13,970
Now the fact that I've already engaged 
in that calculus in that calculation 

3338
02:42:13,970 --> 02:42:17,940
suggests that we are the canaries 
singing in the coal mine.

3339
02:42:18,270 --> 02:42:23,270
And so I think we have to be in an 
environment where we don't engage in 

3340
02:42:23,270 --> 02:42:23,280
this type of self censorship.
So,

3341
02:42:23,700 --> 02:42:27,240
so I think we're definitely down the 
wrong road.

3342
02:42:27,330 --> 02:42:29,310
I think many academics,
uh,

3343
02:42:29,550 --> 02:42:33,630
privately will speak about these issues 
very openly with me,

3344
02:42:33,840 --> 02:42:38,840
but we'll never even so far as go as to 
like something on facebook less they 

3345
02:42:38,840 --> 02:42:39,060
will be.

3346
02:42:39,110 --> 02:42:43,190
I found out so crazy.
You got to worry about your standing.

3347
02:42:43,191 --> 02:42:46,820
You gotta worry about your public 
standing gotta worry about your Job.

3348
02:42:46,821 --> 02:42:51,821
You gotta work.
That's more people to be self 

3349
02:42:51,821 --> 02:42:51,821
sufficient.
You know,

3350
02:42:51,821 --> 02:42:52,700
less to tHink about in that regard.
But when you're an educator,

3351
02:42:52,701 --> 02:42:54,770
how can you be?
in one sense,

3352
02:42:54,771 --> 02:42:56,780
you have tenure.
That kind of helps a lot.

3353
02:42:57,080 --> 02:43:02,080
But tenure creates a lot of hubris.
There's a lot of guys who have tenure 

3354
02:43:02,080 --> 02:43:05,621
that also become untouchable and they 
force feed their students their ideas.

3355
02:43:05,841 --> 02:43:06,300
Apologies.

3356
02:43:06,320 --> 02:43:07,020
Yeah,
absolutely.

3357
02:43:07,050 --> 02:43:10,230
And actually I wrote an article on my 
psychology today blog,

3358
02:43:10,231 --> 02:43:12,340
what I was talking about,
the necessity for tenure,

3359
02:43:12,400 --> 02:43:15,310
but also its potential for misuse,
right?

3360
02:43:15,670 --> 02:43:19,150
Because you do get an incredible amount 
of deadwood with tenure.

3361
02:43:19,660 --> 02:43:24,340
Right.
Do you foresee a time where universities

3362
02:43:24,341 --> 02:43:29,341
won't be the main source of education 
that was somehow or another to be taken 

3363
02:43:29,341 --> 02:43:29,830
care of online?
That's a good question.

3364
02:43:29,831 --> 02:43:31,450
I mean,
right now there's a development of.

3365
02:43:31,451 --> 02:43:33,670
Have you heard of moocs are.
No.

3366
02:43:33,970 --> 02:43:38,970
Moocs are.
I know joey diaz calls moocs or fucking 

3367
02:43:38,970 --> 02:43:38,970
move over here.
Oh,

3368
02:43:38,970 --> 02:43:38,970
he had dumb.
Okay.

3369
02:43:39,120 --> 02:43:41,140
The ball.
Hey,

3370
02:43:41,141 --> 02:43:46,141
right here.
A mooka know a moocs are a massive 

3371
02:43:46,511 --> 02:43:47,870
online.
I can't remember the rest of the day.

3372
02:43:48,430 --> 02:43:53,430
These are courses that are often times 
offered under the auspices of a 

3373
02:43:53,430 --> 02:43:57,031
university,
but they're free courses where people 

3374
02:43:57,031 --> 02:43:59,080
can massively registered.
You have a teaching a course,

3375
02:43:59,260 --> 02:44:00,670
100,000
people.

3376
02:44:00,880 --> 02:44:03,190
Mit does that.
Mit does that as a whole lot.

3377
02:44:03,270 --> 02:44:08,270
Actually.
I tried to to hook up with these guys 

3378
02:44:08,270 --> 02:44:09,730
called coursera that organizes a portal 
for this,

3379
02:44:09,731 --> 02:44:14,731
but they don't have a contract with 
concordia and it has to be between a 

3380
02:44:14,731 --> 02:44:16,840
university and the organization for it 
to fly.

3381
02:44:17,230 --> 02:44:22,230
Uh,
so I do see a potential eventually for 

3382
02:44:22,230 --> 02:44:23,110
sort of a more democratization of 
knowledge,

3383
02:44:23,590 --> 02:44:26,680
but I don't suspect that we're going to 
lose the university anytime soon.

3384
02:44:26,800 --> 02:44:29,050
This is the social aspect of it.
That's so interesting.

3385
02:44:29,051 --> 02:44:34,051
You know,
people go away and the party and they 

3386
02:44:34,051 --> 02:44:34,051
have fun.
They find themselves in Canada though.

3387
02:44:34,051 --> 02:44:34,710
Yeah,
it's interesting.

3388
02:44:34,740 --> 02:44:37,090
[inaudible] I've studied both in the us 
and in Canada.

3389
02:44:37,140 --> 02:44:42,140
A yes part of my study.
And so this greek system going away to 

3390
02:44:42,140 --> 02:44:44,290
college,
not being close to your parents,

3391
02:44:44,480 --> 02:44:45,190
uh,
uh,

3392
02:44:45,191 --> 02:44:47,710
the drinking games,
that's very much,

3393
02:44:47,830 --> 02:44:52,270
much more so of an american right of 
passage then it is a canadian.

3394
02:44:52,271 --> 02:44:57,271
Most canadian students end up going to 
the school that is physically closest to

3395
02:44:57,401 --> 02:44:58,810
them.
That's interesting.

3396
02:44:58,811 --> 02:45:01,770
Is that because it's so paid for by the 
government.

3397
02:45:01,771 --> 02:45:02,740
So you've got.
You got it.

3398
02:45:02,741 --> 02:45:05,800
So in Canada you don't have 
historically.

3399
02:45:05,800 --> 02:45:08,260
I mean now some programs are getting a 
bit more privatized,

3400
02:45:08,261 --> 02:45:10,600
but historically everything is big 
brother,

3401
02:45:11,050 --> 02:45:15,180
so there isn't this huge hierarchy of 
universities,

3402
02:45:15,310 --> 02:45:20,310
the harvard and then whatever and all 
schools are public and so yes,

3403
02:45:20,650 --> 02:45:24,490
mcgill university is more famous than 
some other kenyan university,

3404
02:45:24,491 --> 02:45:29,491
but on average all canadian schools are 
quite good and you have about 40 

3405
02:45:29,491 --> 02:45:32,470
universities and so there's really no 
point in choosing between them and going

3406
02:45:32,471 --> 02:45:37,471
across the country.
In the us you have 3000 colleges and 

3407
02:45:37,471 --> 02:45:41,941
universities.
There's wildly varying on everything in 

3408
02:45:41,941 --> 02:45:42,310
terms of price,
in terms of quality.

3409
02:45:42,490 --> 02:45:46,390
And so I think that's what makes it a 
bit more exciting to choose and pick.

3410
02:45:46,391 --> 02:45:48,160
But then Canada,
they're all good.

3411
02:45:48,220 --> 02:45:53,220
That's interesting.
And in the United States they also have 

3412
02:45:53,220 --> 02:45:55,580
universities that cater specifically to 
religious ideas too.

3413
02:45:56,260 --> 02:45:57,480
Like the,
what was the one that,

3414
02:45:57,481 --> 02:45:58,080
that,
uh,

3415
02:45:58,150 --> 02:46:03,150
someone got in trouble for during one of
the elections for taking support from 

3416
02:46:03,150 --> 02:46:05,530
and that they wouldn't allow interracial
couples.

3417
02:46:05,860 --> 02:46:07,180
Remember that?
Brigham young.

3418
02:46:07,530 --> 02:46:10,100
Was it bringing me up?
It might've been bringing me on.

3419
02:46:10,160 --> 02:46:11,480
I don't,
I don't remember which one it was,

3420
02:46:11,481 --> 02:46:15,320
but if some southern university,
and I forget who they were supporting,

3421
02:46:15,321 --> 02:46:20,321
but it became a big problem with them 
that they had had become aligned with 

3422
02:46:20,751 --> 02:46:25,100
this university that didn't,
didn't allow interracial couples like,

3423
02:46:25,160 --> 02:46:25,820
whoa,
like,

3424
02:46:25,940 --> 02:46:27,790
you know,
at what time the,

3425
02:46:27,810 --> 02:46:30,320
the real problem with that.
Obviously it's racist,

3426
02:46:30,321 --> 02:46:35,321
but also the varying scales of race.
Like is it only pure blood,

3427
02:46:36,790 --> 02:46:38,390
you know,
what are you a fucking vampire?

3428
02:46:38,391 --> 02:46:43,391
Like,
like what if someone is like one slash 

3429
02:46:43,391 --> 02:46:43,910
16th native american is that,
you know,

3430
02:46:43,911 --> 02:46:47,360
is he interracial dating a blonde woman 
from Norway.

3431
02:46:47,780 --> 02:46:51,060
You know,
what if the woman is like one eighth,

3432
02:46:51,140 --> 02:46:53,690
chinese,
one corridor,

3433
02:46:53,691 --> 02:46:56,870
like when do we draw the line and she's 
half chinese.

3434
02:46:57,240 --> 02:46:59,960
Like what the fuck?
What if she lies about it and said she's

3435
02:46:59,961 --> 02:47:04,961
eskimo.
To think that if only I converted the 

3436
02:47:04,961 --> 02:47:08,531
seventh day adventist,
I could be living in southern 

3437
02:47:08,531 --> 02:47:08,531
California.

3438
02:47:08,531 --> 02:47:08,531
Man,
dude,

3439
02:47:08,531 --> 02:47:10,310
you could've been rocking it and teach 
bullshit and teach them bullshit in line

3440
02:47:10,311 --> 02:47:11,660
about jesus.
It would have been awesome.

3441
02:47:11,690 --> 02:47:14,480
Maybe I still might accept them hand.
Yeah,

3442
02:47:14,481 --> 02:47:19,481
you've been tanning.
You can tend to montreal to for about 

3443
02:47:19,481 --> 02:47:19,481
three weeks.
Montreal,

3444
02:47:19,481 --> 02:47:20,540
you probably know this joke.
We have four seasons,

3445
02:47:21,110 --> 02:47:21,890
winter,
winter,

3446
02:47:21,891 --> 02:47:24,410
winter and july.
It's true.

3447
02:47:24,770 --> 02:47:29,770
Well,
july is pretty awesome though and 

3448
02:47:29,770 --> 02:47:31,360
everybody's very festive.
One of the things that I love about any 

3449
02:47:31,360 --> 02:47:34,530
place like Canada or a lot of parts of 
Canada is that they really appreciate 

3450
02:47:35,960 --> 02:47:38,630
the summertime because of the fact that 
water so brutal.

3451
02:47:38,660 --> 02:47:40,130
We oVercame it.
That's exactly right.

3452
02:47:40,430 --> 02:47:45,430
It's the festival sort of city of the 
world because we're completely cocooned 

3453
02:47:45,471 --> 02:47:50,300
from say end of november till say mid 
april and so we make up for it.

3454
02:47:50,660 --> 02:47:53,990
I think it also develops character too.
I've talked about los angeles and that a

3455
02:47:53,991 --> 02:47:56,130
lot of people that are born and raised 
in los angeles,

3456
02:47:56,131 --> 02:47:59,300
so like spoiled rich kids that you know 
also won the lottery.

3457
02:47:59,840 --> 02:48:01,570
TheY don't realize how easy they've got 
it.

3458
02:48:01,571 --> 02:48:06,571
Like the worst the weather gets here,
you have to hit a button and turn the 

3459
02:48:06,571 --> 02:48:09,140
aca is the most brutal thing you have to
do is use your finger to press a button.

3460
02:48:09,170 --> 02:48:10,550
Well,
I remember when we lived here,

3461
02:48:10,551 --> 02:48:15,551
when I was at uc irvine one time we were
driving on the highway and there was a 

3462
02:48:15,551 --> 02:48:19,210
warning weather advisory because there 
was going to be 10 minutes of rain and 

3463
02:48:20,121 --> 02:48:25,121
when it rains the the roads dependently 
become a bit more slippery because of 

3464
02:48:25,161 --> 02:48:26,870
the oil stat.
I don't know exactly what it was.

3465
02:48:27,180 --> 02:48:27,830
I.
So I'm thinking,

3466
02:48:27,831 --> 02:48:32,831
you know,
we drive in minus 30 degrees in small 

3467
02:48:32,831 --> 02:48:35,741
stars.
TheY have warning advisories when it 

3468
02:48:35,741 --> 02:48:36,530
rains for 10 minutes through.
You guys have character.

3469
02:48:36,560 --> 02:48:38,150
We have none.
We're done.

3470
02:48:38,840 --> 02:48:41,360
I'll give up my character to move to 
southern California.

3471
02:48:41,450 --> 02:48:43,280
Well,
you've lived a bunch of years up there.

3472
02:48:43,281 --> 02:48:45,410
You realize that the winners are not 
worth it.

3473
02:48:45,440 --> 02:48:46,760
They get,
they are brutal.

3474
02:48:46,820 --> 02:48:49,010
They,
especially if you have to go anywhere.

3475
02:48:49,040 --> 02:48:52,050
If you could work out of your house all 
winter long and you had a good supply of

3476
02:48:52,051 --> 02:48:55,730
wood and water and food ready for you 
and a bear once in a while to shoot.

3477
02:48:56,420 --> 02:48:58,610
There you go.
Then you can stay warm and full.

3478
02:48:59,180 --> 02:49:01,880
But California,
there's pros and cons.

3479
02:49:01,910 --> 02:49:04,340
The con is obviously that everybody 
knows about it.

3480
02:49:04,360 --> 02:49:06,890
And so you've been here,
you've been here since 94.

3481
02:49:06,990 --> 02:49:07,440
Oh,
okay.

3482
02:49:07,441 --> 02:49:08,540
So you've been here for 20 years.
Yeah,

3483
02:49:08,550 --> 02:49:13,550
it's a.
But I grew up in boston and also 

3484
02:49:13,550 --> 02:49:15,540
delivered newspapers,
so I drove every day,

3485
02:49:15,600 --> 02:49:16,920
300,
65 days a year.

3486
02:49:16,980 --> 02:49:18,510
So snowstorms,
everything.

3487
02:49:18,960 --> 02:49:20,880
One thing is good.
I know how to drive in snow.

3488
02:49:20,910 --> 02:49:21,990
I know to drive real good.

3489
02:49:22,020 --> 02:49:27,020
Right?
Like when the asset and my car kicks 

3490
02:49:27,020 --> 02:49:27,020
out,
I don't sweat it at all.

3491
02:49:27,020 --> 02:49:28,590
Countersteer,
it's like instinctive,

3492
02:49:29,190 --> 02:49:34,190
but you know,
it's more pleasurable to live here if 

3493
02:49:34,190 --> 02:49:34,190
you don't have the.
I mean,

3494
02:49:34,190 --> 02:49:36,240
could you break out into the bostonian 
accent if you want it to?

3495
02:49:36,330 --> 02:49:37,410
Yeah,
I kinda,

3496
02:49:37,470 --> 02:49:40,200
you know what?
I fought once in the bay state games,

3497
02:49:40,440 --> 02:49:45,440
which was this big olympic festivals 
when taekwondo was going into the 

3498
02:49:45,440 --> 02:49:47,910
olympics and I won it.
So I got interviewed on television.

3499
02:49:47,911 --> 02:49:49,440
I heard myself on tv.
I was like,

3500
02:49:49,470 --> 02:49:52,230
oh my god,
I sound like a fucking idiot.

3501
02:49:52,590 --> 02:49:54,480
It was,
my accent was so strong.

3502
02:49:54,481 --> 02:49:55,350
Yeah.
We've been working,

3503
02:49:55,351 --> 02:49:57,500
had training for this.
I'm like,

3504
02:49:57,570 --> 02:49:59,400
oh,
I didn't realize.

3505
02:49:59,460 --> 02:50:04,010
I didn't realize how gross it sounded.
So I abandoned bandler heart too.

3506
02:50:04,340 --> 02:50:09,340
I just abandoned it.
I mean it comes out every now and then 

3507
02:50:09,340 --> 02:50:09,340
if I have a couple drinks in me here,
a little bit of it.

3508
02:50:09,340 --> 02:50:13,670
Right.
But it's a weird accent because I've a 

3509
02:50:13,670 --> 02:50:13,990
little bit of new Jersey to New Jersey.
um,

3510
02:50:14,190 --> 02:50:15,810
man,
we're just about out of time.

3511
02:50:15,840 --> 02:50:17,940
Is there anything else you wanted to 
talk aBout before?

3512
02:50:17,941 --> 02:50:21,180
I just wanted to thank you.
I can't believe all the three hours.

3513
02:50:21,181 --> 02:50:24,260
three hours was like three minutes.
I know you're best ever.

3514
02:50:24,360 --> 02:50:25,650
Ah,
that's ridiculous.

3515
02:50:25,651 --> 02:50:28,140
You're the best guest ever.
It was pretty easy to do.

3516
02:50:28,340 --> 02:50:29,550
Look,
we could do this 100 times,

3517
02:50:29,580 --> 02:50:34,580
man.
Let me know when you're back in town 

3518
02:50:34,580 --> 02:50:34,580
again.
We'll do this again for sure.

3519
02:50:34,580 --> 02:50:35,280
On your books,
what could people buy?

3520
02:50:35,281 --> 02:50:37,320
Where can they buy it?
What do you suggest?

3521
02:50:37,321 --> 02:50:40,510
So I'll probably,
if they want the sort of trade book,

3522
02:50:40,610 --> 02:50:44,500
the book that's written for the masses,
the consuming instinct to millions,

3523
02:50:44,670 --> 02:50:46,740
what?
Juicy burgers for robberies,

3524
02:50:46,770 --> 02:50:51,770
pornography,
and gift giving reveal about human 

3525
02:50:51,770 --> 02:50:52,950
nature so that they could get on amazon 
and they'll be listing of my other books

3526
02:50:52,951 --> 02:50:53,220
there.

3527
02:50:53,250 --> 02:50:55,410
They can check out my psychology today,
blog,

3528
02:50:55,470 --> 02:50:56,570
homo,
consumer focus,

3529
02:50:57,030 --> 02:50:58,620
where I write about everything.
Religion,

3530
02:50:58,621 --> 02:51:03,621
politics.
When you say you better say something 

3531
02:51:03,621 --> 02:51:05,661
else real quick,
homo sapiens kind of homo consumerist 

3532
02:51:09,220 --> 02:51:10,290
gotta.
Be real careful.

3533
02:51:10,440 --> 02:51:11,870
So.
Okay,

3534
02:51:12,230 --> 02:51:13,500
well listen,
thank you very much.

3535
02:51:13,501 --> 02:51:15,240

3538
02:51:20,241 --> 02:51:21,310
We really appreciate it.

Do you have any on books on tape?

3543
02:51:38,190 --> 02:51:40,600
Is it on there?
Not do that.

3544
02:51:40,920 --> 02:51:43,560
You need to audio tape your books,
man.

3545
02:51:44,100 --> 02:51:47,280
Read your books and with that sexy radio
voice.
