00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,720
Hello Freak pitches and,

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,690
and again there's comics are there.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,910
I mean there's this comics out there
that are annoying and there's actors out

4
00:00:08,911 --> 00:00:09,744
there that are great.

5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:10,830
You're going to have both.

6
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,000
But I just missed that sort
of type of sensibility.

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,020
Like the,

8
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:16,853
the comics,

9
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:17,490
when you,

10
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,480
when you hang out with comics,

11
00:00:18,481 --> 00:00:19,560
you're always goofing off.

12
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:20,640
You're always having fun.

13
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:21,691
There's always like,

14
00:00:21,691 --> 00:00:22,860
everyone's laughing at shit.

15
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,830
No one's no one is letting
anybody get away with anything.

16
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,320
Any fucking where you're like,

17
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:27,990
you know,

18
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,370
I remember who the fuck was it where
somebody showed up with a hat on?

19
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,400
I think it was Brian Cowen showed,

20
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,180
oh that's what it was.

21
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,530
Brian Keller friend Jimmy Burke,

22
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:41,160
Brian Count showed up with a hat on
like some sort of like a fedora and he's

23
00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:41,371
like,

24
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:44,040
get that fucking stupid
thing off your head.

25
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:45,600
Like what are you doing?

26
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,370
Like what did you think you were doing?

27
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,361
And Brian's like,

28
00:00:48,361 --> 00:00:49,410
thank God he did that.

29
00:00:49,411 --> 00:00:51,870
Because what if I started
wearing that day we were,

30
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,243
we went to shell.

31
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:53,611
She,

32
00:00:53,611 --> 00:00:56,850
that's the whole fucking day about
New York and tough crowd in all.

33
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,940
And initially we were
there way before this.

34
00:00:59,941 --> 00:01:04,550
But you know the whole comedy
sheller and the fucking Schmidt Kiss,

35
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:05,280
I don't know,

36
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,360
maybe six months ago,

37
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:06,961
eight months ago,

38
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:09,540
Russell Peters walks in and
in Russell's a pretty big act.

39
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,840
It's a big fucking new jack.

40
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,850
He comes in with his entourage and he's
wearing a double breasted fucking pea

41
00:01:18,471 --> 00:01:19,200
coat,

42
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,520
but it's waist high.

43
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,090
And the second we saw it,

44
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,193
Keith,

45
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,880
we couldn't stop fucking smash and him.

46
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,110
Right.

47
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:31,943
And Russell,

48
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:32,461
Bonnie,

49
00:01:32,461 --> 00:01:33,061
Bonnie said,

50
00:01:33,061 --> 00:01:35,400
you look like the little
boy on boardwalk empire,

51
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,270
which fuck it.

52
00:01:39,271 --> 00:01:40,650
I fell out of my seat.

53
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,510
Right Keith.

54
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,310
I mean we're fighting now.

55
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,493
He's fucking,

56
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,450
his crew couldn't laugh
cause they could get fired.

57
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,243
They were like,

58
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,750
but we fucking,

59
00:01:54,751 --> 00:01:58,200
it just cause she at the court
and the table to sell on the back.

60
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,610
It's fucking sharks,

61
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,510
you know,

62
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,210
even back,

63
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:01,980
you know.

64
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,720
So next time he came in,

65
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:05,220
he's a little more fucking ready.

66
00:02:05,221 --> 00:02:05,590
You know,

67
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,170
Russell's like he started slamming,

68
00:02:07,171 --> 00:02:07,790
you know,

69
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,300
cause that's how he's
not that type of comic.

70
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:09,720
And,

71
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,410
and I used,

72
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,630
I fight with money all the time
because while everybody's not late,

73
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,840
well fuck it then don't come to that table
because that's what's going to happen

74
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,340
if you come to that table.

75
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:17,941
I've come to,

76
00:02:17,941 --> 00:02:21,180
I came to that table and I
had a little pimple on my lip.

77
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,340
Fucking Kevin Hart,

78
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,620
fucking poetry's Keith,

79
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:25,831
not,

80
00:02:25,831 --> 00:02:28,520
they all study on for
us has her being taught,

81
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:32,340
you're yelling at singing
it in the fucking dark.

82
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,620
Everybody was just a little bump,

83
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:35,780
you know,

84
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,220
so,

85
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,053
but,

86
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,750
but we would sit up there all night.

87
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,890
It would be me,

88
00:02:40,891 --> 00:02:41,401
Norton,

89
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:42,870
mainly Keith and Patrice.

90
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:43,700
Just Smith.

91
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,580
Billie burr.

92
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,250
Fucking Billy comes into the cellar,

93
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:48,893
right?

94
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:49,291
And she says,

95
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:50,430
I'm going to the world series.

96
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:53,370
It's when the mets were playing
the Yankees in the world share.

97
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:54,204
He says much.

98
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:54,961
He goes,

99
00:02:54,961 --> 00:02:55,650
I'm going to the game.

100
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:55,861
We go,

101
00:02:55,861 --> 00:02:56,291
how the fuck?

102
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:57,150
How did you get tickets?

103
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:57,961
He goes,

104
00:02:57,961 --> 00:02:58,081
well,

105
00:02:58,081 --> 00:03:02,980
these dudes hired me to do a show on
their bus on the way in our giving and

106
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:04,060
right when he said that,

107
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,590
everybody's eyes lit up.

108
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,603
We're,

109
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,553
we,

110
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,023
we,

111
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,320
we did certainly dish.

112
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,730
You guys were a good crowd

113
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:19,120
and off the bus we beat him to
sweat was pouring down Billy's head.

114
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:19,954
He didn't do it.

115
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,280
He gave to giggle away.

116
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:22,541
He wouldn't,

117
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:26,710
he didn't do it again because
we beat up down so hard.

118
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,840
So I mean it just fucking animals.

119
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:32,681
Eddie,

120
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:37,681
if came in there and he started
talking to me and being arrogant,

121
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:39,400
he's gone.

122
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,233
Uh,

123
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,940
how much did you make or
what do you do with this?

124
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,370
And I go,

125
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:44,530
well,

126
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:44,861
I don't know.

127
00:03:44,861 --> 00:03:45,251
I made it.

128
00:03:45,251 --> 00:03:45,491
He goes,

129
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:47,200
why me and Patrice?

130
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:48,410
Like he was Patrice said,

131
00:03:48,411 --> 00:03:49,244
tell him he goes,

132
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:49,671
first of all,

133
00:03:49,671 --> 00:03:50,504
he called him Eddie,

134
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,003
right?

135
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,123
Patrice,

136
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,203
Patrice.

137
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,080
You do colleges p you Versiti
or something or you stink.

138
00:04:01,301 --> 00:04:02,080
I don't know what he,

139
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,680
but he beat up Eddie.

140
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,370
If verbally for 40 no one else jumped in.

141
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,170
It was such a beating.

142
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,380
It was such a busy day.

143
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,441
I was driving home.

144
00:04:11,441 --> 00:04:12,021
I had a call,

145
00:04:12,021 --> 00:04:12,850
nor did I go.

146
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:17,850
I can't stop laughing so that
you don't get that in La Nicus.

147
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:18,701
You're like,

148
00:04:18,701 --> 00:04:19,930
in a year you go to New York,

149
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,280

in when the wrong fucking hat or just

150
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,840
your fucking shirt is too
tight or any imperfection.

151
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,231
Yeah,

152
00:04:29,231 --> 00:04:30,430
they correct.

153
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,770
They're coming out of La and they're like,

154
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:32,980

155
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,813
so what do you got?

156
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:34,900
What's going on?

157
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,860
Go Fuck Yourself.

158
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,460
Yeah.

159
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,540
Not Tell you what's not going
on that fucking hair too.

160
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,180
That's,

161
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:40,780
that's the,

162
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,950
that's not going on.

163
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,903
Okay.

164
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,160
You look like a Roman nickel.

165
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,053
Go Fuck Yourself.

166
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,650
But you can't do that here.

167
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:48,490
Well,

168
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:49,480
you can't have the store.

169
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:50,783
Yeah.

170
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:51,831
They even have that,

171
00:04:51,831 --> 00:04:52,061
that,

172
00:04:52,061 --> 00:04:55,040
that comic battle every
Tuesday night at midnight.

173
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:55,851
That's so packed.

174
00:04:55,851 --> 00:04:56,181
You can't,

175
00:04:56,181 --> 00:04:56,661
you can't even,

176
00:04:56,661 --> 00:04:59,300
people are hanging from
stairways just to hear it.

177
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,500
It's so packed.

178
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:02,450
And that's just two comics
battling each other.

179
00:05:02,451 --> 00:05:02,680
Yeah.

180
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,220
Gotcha.

181
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,620
Stores real renaissance.

182
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,060
Yeah.

183
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:06,880
To come back.

184
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,330
Yeah.

185
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:10,270
That cosmic battle was every
night at the shelter at a table.

186
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,110
It's true.

187
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:11,830
And it was,

188
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,110
but it kept you on your fucking toes.

189
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,830
Don't Kevin Hall and Kevin was
moving from New York to La.

190
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,860
We had a little thing
at Boston comedy club.

191
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:21,670
Right.

192
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,120
And he's on,

193
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,510
he goes on stage to like say goodbye me,

194
00:05:25,511 --> 00:05:26,560
Patricia and Keith.

195
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:29,470
It was like 20 phone books
in the back for summary.

196
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,040
We were thrown foam books.

197
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:31,590
Adam,

198
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:34,240
as he's saying goodbye and all
your soul solar's phone books,

199
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:35,380
he did cross the room.

200
00:05:35,381 --> 00:05:36,640
That fucking dumb Kevin Hart.

201
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,653
Okay.

202
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,760
Who's making 20 fucking million a movie,

203
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,140
little fucking news.

204
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,500
So it just makes you,

205
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:45,880
it makes you a better,

206
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,820
stronger standard fucking
standup because you hang it,

207
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:53,200
you're hanging with strong fucking standup
and you also recognize the holes in

208
00:05:53,201 --> 00:05:54,034
your game

209
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,400
exposed.

210
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:56,990
You know?

211
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,460
Not everybody can do that.

212
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:58,700
No.

213
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,180
You know,

214
00:05:59,180 --> 00:05:59,861
and and I,

215
00:05:59,861 --> 00:06:02,600
and I would fight with
fucking Bonnie called me now.

216
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:03,200
Me.

217
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:03,710
Hello.

218
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,900
Are you seriously taking a phone
call while we're in the middle?

219
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:06,231
There we go.

220
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:06,960
I'm talking about,

221
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,150
I'm on a gives podcast.

222
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,343
Hi Bonnie.

223
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,260
Oh,

224
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:11,971
I can hear that.

225
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:12,501
You just said,

226
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:13,800
why are you answering your phone?

227
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,980
I thought you said shut that off.

228
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,130
Why would you think it's
an emergency with her?

229
00:06:19,131 --> 00:06:20,600
Because she's driving home.

230
00:06:20,601 --> 00:06:21,620
It's got damn podcast.

231
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:22,170
Shut that down.

232
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,003
Sorry.

233
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,590
Are you very clingy,

234
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,130
rich?

235
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,120

00:06:26,121 --> 00:06:26,620

238
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,160
let me explain something to you.

239
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,180
You don't ever,

240
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:29,511

241
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:31,130
you've been doing this 10 years.

242
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,160
You luckily have a surprise show tonight.

243
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,173
Okay.

244
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:35,361
No,

245
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:36,350
it's just surprises.

246
00:06:36,351 --> 00:06:38,030
You have a show that's a surprise.

247
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:38,940
Uh,

248
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,100
I know I'm not calling me.

249
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,193
She,

250
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:41,871
I'm only kind,

251
00:06:41,871 --> 00:06:43,850
I don't mean to disrespect
you and in your home.

252
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:44,883
Uh,

253
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,950
has there ever been anything that people
have said to you that had stung enough

254
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:50,160
where you overthink it?

255
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:50,540
Like,

256
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,090
like when you're doing these battles
and you're getting riffed on like,

257
00:06:53,091 --> 00:06:55,040
like I remember like a long time
ago people were saying like,

258
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,510
your ears smelled and like,

259
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,171
does that get to you?

260
00:06:57,171 --> 00:06:57,291
Like,

261
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:57,561
oh shit,

262
00:06:57,561 --> 00:06:58,394
my ears smell.

263
00:06:58,410 --> 00:06:59,130
No,

264
00:06:59,130 --> 00:06:59,870
no,

265
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:00,051
no.

266
00:07:00,051 --> 00:07:00,861
The only time I had,

267
00:07:00,861 --> 00:07:00,950
yeah,

268
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:01,670
I had a,

269
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:02,900
I had an all out.

270
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,430
It got pretty ugly with uh,

271
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:06,390
uh,

272
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,000
bigly on ONA.

273
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,630
He came,

274
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,940
he was doing the virus tour one show.

275
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,080
Yeah.

276
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,301
And it,

277
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,610
and we squashed this,

278
00:07:16,611 --> 00:07:17,540
but it's on you.

279
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:18,861
We squash it.

280
00:07:18,861 --> 00:07:20,690
But he didn't have the best set that deal.

281
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:23,750
And I was hosting those shows
and that don't want any slice me.

282
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,090
So he went on and he goes,

283
00:07:26,091 --> 00:07:27,050
what do you want me to be like,

284
00:07:27,051 --> 00:07:28,400
philosophy and work the crowd.

285
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,450
So he started going out to the
crowd and it didn't go well.

286
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,840
So it's not all his fault too.

287
00:07:35,841 --> 00:07:37,430
They put them up towards
the end of the show,

288
00:07:37,431 --> 00:07:37,731
you know,

289
00:07:37,731 --> 00:07:39,680
the show is going for fucking hours,

290
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:40,610
you know,

291
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:41,870
it wasn't all,

292
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,231
you know,

293
00:07:42,231 --> 00:07:43,580
he should have had a better spot,

294
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,953
you know?

295
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:45,830
Yeah.

296
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,461
So I mean,

297
00:07:46,461 --> 00:07:48,080
they're not fucking a fucking animals.

298
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,130
They're mutants.

299
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,353
Okay.

300
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,000
Dare fucking their
basement dweller mutants.

301
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:53,893
Okay.

302
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,823
Uh,

303
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,900
so he,

304
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:01,930
but then he came into ona and he and
I had been doing this show for fucking

305
00:08:02,421 --> 00:08:04,340
years and he started
making fun of how I talk.

306
00:08:04,341 --> 00:08:07,580
He made some joke and he was being
really arrogant and this and that.

307
00:08:07,581 --> 00:08:08,414
And I go,

308
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:08,970
uh,

309
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:09,360
you know,

310
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,191
I started booing and I'm,

311
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:10,371
I go,

312
00:08:10,371 --> 00:08:11,780
let me make you feel on blue.

313
00:08:11,781 --> 00:08:15,680
And then it just got worse and
worse and it got really ugly.

314
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:20,930
But he was so passive aggressive about
his fucking swarmy type of fucking humor,

315
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,161
but don't come.

316
00:08:22,161 --> 00:08:23,730
That's like what I just fucking trash,

317
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,700
which I shouldn't have because
he says you're a fucking deal.

318
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,463
This is your deal.

319
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:28,401
You know,

320
00:08:28,401 --> 00:08:29,234
I'm only kidding,

321
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:29,721
you know,

322
00:08:29,721 --> 00:08:30,350
a little bit.

323
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,030
And so,

324
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,160
and uh,

325
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,090
but no,

326
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:35,780
there's nothing that,

327
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,613
you know,

328
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,480
we come from the radio.

329
00:08:38,481 --> 00:08:39,380
I do when I do,

330
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,890
they're all fucking Alamos.

331
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,141
I know.

332
00:08:41,141 --> 00:08:41,480
And a,

333
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,620
everything's a fucking,

334
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,920
you say something wrong
or do this or you're done.

335
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,113
You know,

336
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,200
I heard the first day
back when he sat and,

337
00:08:49,201 --> 00:08:49,480
uh,

338
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,090
Anthony Shared Christie,

339
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:53,930
he says,

340
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:54,520
it's fuck him.

341
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,390
I never really liked him.

342
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,243
Anyway,

343
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,750
I go,

344
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,160
let's get this audition started.

345
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,210
Anthony's chairs in fucking long island.

346
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,453
Okay.

347
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,583
Like,

348
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:05,941
you know,

349
00:09:05,941 --> 00:09:06,541
showed no,

350
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,310
just sometimes fun.

351
00:09:08,311 --> 00:09:09,240
That's what people don't understand.

352
00:09:09,241 --> 00:09:09,790
Like it's,

353
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,610
it's great to be in that company.

354
00:09:11,611 --> 00:09:12,450
It's good times.

355
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,230
People are so sensitive
about goofing on each other.

356
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,040
Yeah.

357
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,650
People are so sensitive
about people cracking jokes.

358
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,710
But if someone cracks a joke
about something that you're doing,

359
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:23,611
most likely,

360
00:09:23,611 --> 00:09:25,140
the reason why these
things is that you know,

361
00:09:25,141 --> 00:09:26,970
they're right and you don't want to,

362
00:09:26,971 --> 00:09:28,980
you don't want to admit that
you're doing something goofy.

363
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:30,660
So you get all butthurt well,

364
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:31,740
the only thing that gets me,

365
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:32,850
sometimes it's dope.

366
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,650
When I slur or someone,

367
00:09:34,651 --> 00:09:34,981
you know,

368
00:09:34,981 --> 00:09:39,690
may like people on Twitter
think they're my friends.

369
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,460
I think there should,

370
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:41,890
they try.

371
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:42,330
They,

372
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:42,750
you know,

373
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,560
they're not,

374
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,280
you're not Norton.

375
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,150
You're not Bobby.

376
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,021
You're not Billy.

377
00:09:46,021 --> 00:09:47,070
You're not calling.

378
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,020
They're insulting user.

379
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:48,854
They think of,

380
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,340
and I go look,

381
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:51,301
you know,

382
00:09:51,301 --> 00:09:51,510
there's,

383
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,170
I think there's a,

384
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,003
uh,

385
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,940
a Twitter handle blocked by Veloce.

386
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:55,963
Uh,

387
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:02,040
I black these cocksuckers
all the time because they,

388
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:02,874
you know,

389
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,520
they're trying to get you to talk
about and which you are even good.

390
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:08,160
[inaudible] names blacked my boss.

391
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:09,820
Uh,

392
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,653
so

393
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:13,951
that's true.

394
00:10:13,951 --> 00:10:14,784
But they got you.

395
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:16,810
They got me fit.

396
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,530
So yeah,

397
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:18,390
there's not much,

398
00:10:18,391 --> 00:10:18,810
I mean,

399
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:19,380
cause I'm a,

400
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,071
I'm a creep.

401
00:10:20,071 --> 00:10:20,770
I fucking,

402
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:21,470
this is differences.

403
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:21,931
You're funny.

404
00:10:21,931 --> 00:10:22,171
You know,

405
00:10:22,171 --> 00:10:24,660
and some people do it and they don't
know that they're not being funny.

406
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,170
They just,

407
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:25,681
some people that,

408
00:10:25,681 --> 00:10:25,801
oh,

409
00:10:25,801 --> 00:10:28,320
you can't take a joke when they're
just being there just being shitty.

410
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,700
It just being like a rude person.

411
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,010
Well it's not a joke and be funny,

412
00:10:32,011 --> 00:10:32,401
you know,

413
00:10:32,401 --> 00:10:33,234
it's just,

414
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,051
I don't know.

415
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:34,381
I mean,

416
00:10:34,381 --> 00:10:36,180
cause you can't take a joke rich.

417
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:39,710
I married one in a meanest
female comics on the planet.

418
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,100
She just fucking mean.

419
00:10:41,101 --> 00:10:42,930
That's why we,

420
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,381
you know,

421
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:44,760
we fight nonstop,

422
00:10:44,761 --> 00:10:49,761
but we come together when we find a
victim that we both want to attack.

423
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:54,690
When you're somebody that we both
can go after at the same time next,

424
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,910
where our love really
comes out for each other.

425
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,463
That's where you,

426
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,060
you know,

427
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,790
because like when our manager will
call and say something stupid,

428
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:05,460
we'll just start fucking
attacking them together.

429
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,631
Even when he hangs up,

430
00:11:06,631 --> 00:11:08,430
we just keep it attacking
it until we're done.

431
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:09,420
And,

432
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:09,781
and,

433
00:11:09,781 --> 00:11:10,260
and,

434
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,610
and nearshore love,

435
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,390
you know.
