1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:05,940
The joe rogan experience it.
I mean obviously it seemed way worse

2
00:00:06,041 --> 00:00:10,420
over on your side,
but I was more worried when they made us

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,130
leave because the further up you got in
the bleachers and once you got out into

4
00:00:15,131 --> 00:00:17,290
the concession area and in the
bathrooms,

5
00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:20,500
that's where stuff was going down.
Like just people from the crowd.

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,620
Um,
you know guys with Irish flags all

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,670
obviously we're getting trashed,
talked to them and there was a big brawl

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,970
right next to me on the other side from
where they were sitting.

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,100
Right.
There was one just to our right.

10
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,470
I was looking left,
believe it was the guy that jumped in

11
00:00:35,471 --> 00:00:37,750
and the registered on Khabib's team when
they were trying to leave,

12
00:00:37,751 --> 00:00:40,090
when they're getting them out,
people in the crowd were like,

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,880
ah,
they start throwing shit at them first.

14
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,740
That's how the,
that's where the first shit was getting

15
00:00:44,741 --> 00:00:47,650
thrown down and letting people know that
it was them.

16
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,350
We,
we all saw it was like,

17
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:51,970
that's the guy,
that's the guy right there right now.

18
00:00:51,971 --> 00:00:53,230
It's like,
I don't know.

19
00:00:53,231 --> 00:00:54,610
And he went and tried to do something
and I was

20
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:57,620
doing,
but you know,

21
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,870
there's a price to be paid for all this
shit.

22
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:03,330
Like all the,
all the drama and the trash talking.

23
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,360
That makes it so fun.
It also,

24
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,610
you know,
it has the potential for blowing up in

25
00:01:07,611 --> 00:01:10,790
your face ultimately.
You like a couple people got punched,

26
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,210
but it was in an event where a bunch of
people got punched.

27
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:16,280
You know what I mean?
It's like way more than that.

28
00:01:16,281 --> 00:01:17,450
It was awesome.
Yeah.

29
00:01:17,451 --> 00:01:19,300
But you know what I'm saying?
It's like we,

30
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,580
we've made it seem,
it seemed like it was way worse than it

31
00:01:22,581 --> 00:01:27,581
really was because in any other
situation it would be way worse than it

32
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:28,340
really was.

33
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,910
Like if it was a rock concert and some
dudes just from,

34
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:32,720
you know,
let,

35
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,390
you know,
one band was the opening band and then

36
00:01:35,391 --> 00:01:38,810
there was another band that was in a
brawl with them and they were,

37
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:43,580
they were the main event and then the
fans of one band through down with the

38
00:01:43,581 --> 00:01:45,110
fans,
the other band of beat the shit out of

39
00:01:45,111 --> 00:01:46,220
each other.
That would,

40
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:50,810
for whatever reason,
be way worse than when it's at a fight.

41
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,940
Cause if it's at a fight,
it's just fighters.

42
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,980
Oh,
I saw this in St Cloud.

43
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:59,870
This was going on,
this insane clown posse guy tried to

44
00:01:59,871 --> 00:02:01,820
drop kick Fred Durst,
he,

45
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:03,440
Fred,
there's wasn't even looking at them

46
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:06,680
running headstart and misses and look at
it.

47
00:02:06,681 --> 00:02:09,800
It turns around like what?
And he just kept going.

48
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:14,950
I haven't seen they drag that dude off.
I mean that is maybe the worst public

49
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,800
dropkick in the history of the world.

50
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:23,930
I think they meant he dropped when he
tried to kick even after that.

51
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:24,960
Um,
you know,

52
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,020
were,
we were working very hard for this fight

53
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:27,890
in the limit,
you know,

54
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,990
somewhat limited period of time.
Um,

55
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,170
so we did,
didn't taper off quite the way we

56
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:35,200
normally do,
but roughly two weeks if you wanted to

57
00:02:35,201 --> 00:02:37,870
do a rematch and if the UFC did grant
agreement,

58
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:43,010
this is obviously dependent upon how the
Nevada state athletic commission handles

59
00:02:43,491 --> 00:02:46,550
the legal ramifications of him jumping
out of the cage,

60
00:02:46,551 --> 00:02:49,640
attacking Dylan Dannis a subsequent
brawl.

61
00:02:49,641 --> 00:02:52,310
The chaos that ensued.
Visas.

62
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,460
You mean you're,
you're dealing with a lot of legal shit

63
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,800
in his fight that that could hold things
up?

64
00:02:57,801 --> 00:03:00,130
I mean,
they held both is correct.

65
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,380
Uh,
well he held a Habib's kind of got his,

66
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:03,041
yeah.
Okay.

67
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:08,041
Kind of got his purse paid so he gets
his first and Qbb.

68
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,240
Who the fuck knows what's going to
happen with him,

69
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,103
you know,
and uh,

70
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,011
yeah.
I,

71
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:14,260
I hope they're,
they're lenient on them and I'm not just

72
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,790
so we can get a rematch.
I mean,

73
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,820
I love watching him fight for his diet
and I can,

74
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,660
I can stretch myself to understand his
reaction.

75
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,110
I can stretch myself.
I can't stretch myself to understand the

76
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,800
other guys' reactions on what they did
leave.

77
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,860
He jumped over the cage and he jumps on.
It's,

78
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,990
it's not the end of the hall.
The guy that jumped in there was wearing

79
00:03:34,991 --> 00:03:37,210
red who punched on her.
Yeah.

80
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,250
I'm not sure.
I think that's a boxing and coach,

81
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:40,960
but I'm,
I'm guessing he's a fighter.

82
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:42,610
He fights with the UFC,
uh,

83
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,340
into red was done not an old,
he wasn't older.

84
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,110
He actually worked with them.
Oh,

85
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,400
okay.
You work?

86
00:03:48,401 --> 00:03:49,600
There you go.
Who is he?

87
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,730
I don't know his name.
Islamorada son.

88
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,380
Yeah.
It was either his Llama.

89
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,960
Yeah.
I don't think it was either one of those

90
00:03:58,961 --> 00:04:01,120
guys like I know is laughing guy.
He was,

91
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,910
you know,
he hit done and a guy in a suit that

92
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,850
heritage is Russian manager.
He hit dylan either way.

93
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,860
Um,
but actually indicates when your mind

94
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,640
went in and,
and hit him from behind then.

95
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,580
Yeah.
You know,

96
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,320
I kinda,
I can't understand that.

97
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,151
Like I said,
for,

98
00:04:15,151 --> 00:04:16,040
for,
for Habib,

99
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,530
I didn't think it was,
you know,

100
00:04:17,531 --> 00:04:19,150
it was,
it's just,

101
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:22,370
it's such a foolish thing to do because
this thing to do,

102
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,320
I know that Dylan was talking shit and
he was angry,

103
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:29,550
but like she didn't say anything because
I heard a few people saying that.

104
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,820
No,
I was standing beside dylan.

105
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,950
I didn't see what he did,
but I could hear.

106
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,900
So he didn't say anything now.
And I watched the back.

107
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:36,280
I seen,
he kind of beckoned them on.

108
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,383
Yeah.
You know,

109
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:40,650
just stupid end the fight stuff.
But it,

110
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,740
I didn't think it justified that level
of response.

111
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:44,350
And maybe there was something else in
the lead up,

112
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:46,930
you know,
dealing as a bit of a troll online.

113
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,033
So,
uh,

114
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,380
there was probably a bit of a buildup of
voter stuff,

115
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,510
but um,
yeah,

116
00:04:52,511 --> 00:04:53,111
like I said,
it,

117
00:04:53,111 --> 00:04:55,410
it wasn't that big a deal to me.
What had beaded.

118
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,680
Yeah.
Just really wasn't,

119
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:01,420
there's something I like love about a
man so deeply out of touch.

120
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,500
I mean that's the thing is like,
yeah,

121
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:05,530
look it up.
Fucking thumbs fucking up.

122
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:11,850
Me and my wife's just as Sarah Palin,
I love this fucking city by the,

123
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,800
the sexual chemistry between them is
palpable.

124
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,750
Probably Real,
super rich.

125
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,890
You were talking about at the beginning
of like,

126
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,720
like cults and I'm like,
I'm thinking about,

127
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,230
I'm thinking about,
I'm thinking about Tom Cruise and

128
00:05:26,231 --> 00:05:29,350
scientology.
There's a man using every ounce of what

129
00:05:29,351 --> 00:05:34,120
scientology is offering to make himself
the best available man that he's capable

130
00:05:34,121 --> 00:05:34,954
of being.
Yeah.

131
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,070
Then you've got Travolta,
you know what I mean?

132
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:43,930
Like you've got two versions of like,
like Amanda is becoming slightly out of

133
00:05:43,931 --> 00:05:46,150
touch with what he,
you know,

134
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,860
Eh,
no,

135
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,120
look at my fucking wig bank.
It's a good way.

136
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,770
How amazing our wigs these days.
He's got great legs.

137
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,680
I mean,
that's a fucking incredible wig.

138
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,310
Wig thinning.

139
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:01,220
Just a little bit upfront.
You would think that's his hair.

140
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,110
He's living the dream.
It's incredible.

141
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,240
He's living in the goddamn dream.
Uh,

142
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:07,160
you okay with time?
We can wrap this up or whatever.

143
00:06:07,161 --> 00:06:08,530
Yeah.
I'm 33 30 yeah,

144
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,660
we're,
what does that appear on the Oj thing?

145
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,800
Oh yeah,
that was,

146
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:14,900
I saw him.
That's amazing.

147
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:17,690
That little,
that Little Chin is that his,

148
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,810
he wore a little chimp.
He got like a little Chin Yamaka there.

149
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,480
It's unbelievable.
I remember seeing him at an award

150
00:06:23,481 --> 00:06:28,130
ceremony that and then that when he had
that Little Chin thing and I was like,

151
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:33,050
did he put that on after the thing?
I met him when his wife was on fear

152
00:06:33,051 --> 00:06:34,730
factor.
Really?

153
00:06:34,731 --> 00:06:35,990
Yeah.
Kelly Preston was on fear.

154
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,830
She was on fear factor.
Yeah.

155
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,460
Celebrity fear factor.
David Hasselhoff.

156
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,720
Kelly.
Wow.

157
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:42,980
Preston.
How were they?

158
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,860
She was really nice.
She was super friendly,

159
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,260
but I felt like I felt like they
recruited people.

160
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,580
Yes.
Yeah.

161
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:57,560
I mean they were there.
Scientology was sort of a stigmatized,

162
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,420
it was,
there was a lot of people that were

163
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:01,280
joining it.
What is going on there?

164
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:06,540
What we see is a black cap on that hair
is so crazy fake looking.

165
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,080
That's like that magnetic man that you
could like move.

166
00:07:09,081 --> 00:07:14,060
The magnets are on the Korean hair.
Like who's fucking hair looks like that?

167
00:07:14,061 --> 00:07:15,440
That's crazy,
man.

168
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:16,400
That's,
I mean,

169
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,020
the color,
everything is wrong.

170
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,010
That's madness.
Like when someone says Stephen Hawking's

171
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,610
identified as a British,
he identifies a dead or dying when he

172
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,444
was alive.
Yeah.

173
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,830
Brilliant.
British physicist slash heterosexual

174
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:34,820
atheist,
a heterosexual identify who by the way

175
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:35,683
was,
um,

176
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,551
uh,
rebuttal.

177
00:07:36,551 --> 00:07:39,260
The freak riddled with infidelity.
I've never met a guy,

178
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,980
so not capable of,
of cheating and found a way to cheat on

179
00:07:42,981 --> 00:07:43,431
his wife.
Well,

180
00:07:43,431 --> 00:07:44,630
apparently you can still get it up.

181
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,840
Oh,
well apparently even though his body

182
00:07:47,841 --> 00:07:50,390
didn't move,
could feel things.

183
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,480
That was his son.
He is the scientist he used to go to was

184
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,180
Eric Weinstein told me about this.
I was like,

185
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:56,691
what?
He's like,

186
00:07:56,691 --> 00:07:57,524
yeah,
he's a freak.

187
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,460
And I was like,
wait,

188
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,510
what?
And he's like,

189
00:07:59,511 --> 00:08:01,520
yeah,
he used to go to strip clubs and there's

190
00:08:01,521 --> 00:08:04,400
like videos of him like rolling into a
strip club in the wheelchair.

191
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,620
Like he would go.
That was his thing.

192
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,720
Where'd you get littered with
infidelity?

193
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:10,790
What'd you hear?
That he cheated on his wife all the

194
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,780
time.
We w we in that fucking movie.

195
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,740
The whole reason that he,
well,

196
00:08:15,741 --> 00:08:18,320
I mean the whole reason that he left his
wife was because he fell in love with

197
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:20,160
somebody else.
But wasn't it like a nurse there was

198
00:08:20,161 --> 00:08:23,470
taking down what the truth was that he
was my boss and the nurses,

199
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:28,160
if you google,
if you Google Stephen Hawking,

200
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,680
he was affiliate of,
he was always fucking around.

201
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:31,893
Oh.
You know,

202
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,950
come on man.
He was always fucking around.

203
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,030
Um,
yeah.

204
00:08:36,031 --> 00:08:38,020
That's once he got to love the good
pubs.

205
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,700
Yeah.
Once he got to take the good gosh.

206
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,900
Yeah.
Mad that cosmology cash.

207
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,230
Yeah.
You know what also,

208
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:48,920
he's probably like my cock and a play by
the rules.

209
00:08:48,921 --> 00:08:51,760
The world dealt me the shittiest God,
please.

210
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,380
I'm a super genius and you know what?
I fucking agree.

211
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,840
Do whatever the fuck you want to do and
you want to leave me,

212
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,350
you should leave me.
Why would you only fuck me?

213
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,390
Yeah,
I'm,

214
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,470
I'm,
I'm barely here.

215
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:07,530
I'm a machine now.
I use this finger to talk.

216
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,550
No,
it fell apart.

217
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,730
It was his eyes and his fucking in his
mouth.

218
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:12,960
At some point you can even use his
hands.

219
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:14,100
It was just nice,
right?

220
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,160
Yeah.
Wasn't it as ideal?

221
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,010
I kind of a thing where he could kind of
click.

222
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,000
He would do.
He would,

223
00:09:18,001 --> 00:09:21,060
he would look at something too.
He had a thing where it was taken away.

224
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:25,060
Then I dug.
He would look at Shit and it was maybe I

225
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,860
want to see your ass hole.
Can you sit on my face?

226
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:30,870
Face face.
Don't kill me though.

227
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:34,170
I'm going to figure out the universe.
I don't,

228
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:38,910
don't smother me with your pussy.
I need to figure out how stars work.

229
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:43,911
Is there are black holes real or is it
just a brown star?

230
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,470
Please.
I don't want to drown in your pussy.

231
00:09:46,471 --> 00:09:50,850
I'm still on the subject of dark matter.
I'm trying to figure out the universe

232
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:52,440
before.
I know in my pants,

233
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,490
that's what the,
that's one of the strippers that he got

234
00:09:54,491 --> 00:09:59,491
hooked up with was called dark matter.
I'm trying to think around dark matter,

235
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,700
dark matter.
I could see her with a big Ole fur coat.

236
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,450
Hell yeah.
He's going to say for a big Ole for

237
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,170
Bush.
Yes.

238
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,550
Take a message with a,
with a,

239
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:12,570
a pencil because her nails are too long.
Long that dark matter.

240
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,700
That's what it was.
But that was one that got brought up as

241
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:17,990
well.

242
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,230
That was also in the middle of a huge
conversation about,

243
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:25,790
you know,
Ben Gazi and the Iran deal.

244
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:29,630
Those are the two things or two of the
three things that I like to do on

245
00:10:29,631 --> 00:10:31,490
twitter,
although I'm no longer on there.

246
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,310
You got off.
Yeah.

247
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,110
Bad for you.
Yeah.

248
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,380
I was glad to see Kanye West got off
too.

249
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,550
Did he?
Yeah.

250
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:42,220
Delete all his accounts last week.
And I was glad too.

251
00:10:42,221 --> 00:10:46,180
Cause you're just like,
once you're a target it's just too

252
00:10:46,181 --> 00:10:47,650
painful.
Yeah.

253
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,740
Well definitely shouldn't be reading
that shit.

254
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:51,820
No,
I don't read it.

255
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,050
Yeah.
But,

256
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:54,211
um,
well,

257
00:10:54,211 --> 00:10:56,140
when you become a target,
how do you know if you don't read it?

258
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:00,020
Well,
I know what I'd lived through when first

259
00:11:00,021 --> 00:11:03,290
happened and that's been like four or so
months ago,

260
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:07,970
so I just know how I've reacted in my
locker or real life since that happened

261
00:11:07,971 --> 00:11:08,540
to me.

262
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:12,560
How long did it take for things die off
to die off?

263
00:11:12,561 --> 00:11:14,900
What do you mean slow down?
Where they weren't just coming after you

264
00:11:14,901 --> 00:11:17,870
constantly,
like I told you that news crews,

265
00:11:17,871 --> 00:11:20,780
when they found out that you were going
to come on the podcast the first time

266
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,600
they were trying to show up at my house,
they were trying to show up at the

267
00:11:23,601 --> 00:11:25,250
studio.
They were trying to find me at the

268
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:26,520
comedy store.
Yeah.

269
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,970
I mean they were just trying to hunt
down.

270
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,710
Yeah.
Anything about you?

271
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:35,060
I know I was sneaking segues from my
boyfriend because we were at my mom's

272
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:36,500
house when I did it.
You know,

273
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:42,030
w we were at home in Salt Lake City.
When I tweeted at 2:11 AM I just woke up

274
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,710
and I had this thought in my head,
oh my God,

275
00:11:45,711 --> 00:11:50,711
this can make so much sense.
And then I tweeted it and I went right

276
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:53,240
back to sleep.
And when I woke up at seven,

277
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,820
the shit had hit the fan,
you know?

278
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,350
Yeah.
But I was like,

279
00:11:56,351 --> 00:11:59,260
I'm going to expound on this later.
That was one of those kinds of things.

280
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:02,170
You just want to get it down.
And I,

281
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,750
you know,
always slept with my computer and tweet

282
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:05,950
when I wake up.
Like,

283
00:12:05,951 --> 00:12:07,330
you know,
when you're old you have to go to the

284
00:12:07,331 --> 00:12:09,250
bathroom a lot.
So I always tweet and fall back to

285
00:12:09,251 --> 00:12:10,900
sleep.
C and I,

286
00:12:10,901 --> 00:12:13,120
and then on the Ambien tweets,
my daughter,

287
00:12:13,121 --> 00:12:15,300
I used to always,
when I took my Ambien,

288
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:17,440
I called my daughter and she or she
called me,

289
00:12:17,441 --> 00:12:18,330
she goes,
mom,

290
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,410
you,
you're starting to do the Ambien tweets.

291
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,330
Get off,
get off the twitter,

292
00:12:22,331 --> 00:12:23,470
you know?
But,

293
00:12:23,471 --> 00:12:24,280
uh,
I,

294
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,590
so I just called my daughter.
Then every night when I,

295
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:29,950
when I was doing the Ambien and I'd go,
you know what,

296
00:12:29,951 --> 00:12:32,500
here comes a big fish.
She recorded it.

297
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,470
Here comes a big fish right through my
window.

298
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:38,170
Oh,
he's getting stuck in the mirror

299
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:41,650
and she,
that's where she goes,

300
00:12:41,651 --> 00:12:46,120
mom turned it all off and go to sleep.
I have to have my family telling me that

301
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,820
because neither standing guard by your
bed.

302
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:49,541
Yeah.
