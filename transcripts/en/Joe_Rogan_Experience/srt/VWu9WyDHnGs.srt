1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,500
Her low freak bitches.
A lot of times it's just giving people

2
00:00:04,501 --> 00:00:06,030
information right then and there and
saying,

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,810
you know,
getting people riled up and excited and

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,030
giving them the support to do it.
So,

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,810
um,
we're going to do about a 40 city tour

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,990
of solutions grassroots in New York
state in February and March.

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,300
So we'll do like three or four towns a
day.

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,231
Um,
and I'll,

9
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:25,770
I'll be doing that with Zephyr teachout
who was incredibly popular,

10
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,430
um,
candidate for governor who won 35% of

11
00:00:29,431 --> 00:00:31,290
the vote against Andrew Cuomo and his
last election.

12
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,320
Um,
and a number of musical guests.

13
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,570
I think we're going to be doing that in
February and March.

14
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,840
We'd love to do the solutions grassroots
tour in California.

15
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,300
Um,
I'd love to do it in other states.

16
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:45,210
So you can go to solutions,
grassroots.com you can sign up there.

17
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:45,701
You can,
there,

18
00:00:45,701 --> 00:00:49,230
there are links that directly you can
buy solar.

19
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,670
Uh,
you can buy wind power,

20
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:53,040
you can do all of that at a consumer
level.

21
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,290
But more importantly,
what we're trying to do with solutions

22
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:57,710
grassroots is getting grassroots,
um,

23
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,040
energy movement towards getting
ourselves off fossil fuels.

24
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:05,430
Because you know this,
even though like you can map this out at

25
00:01:05,431 --> 00:01:10,320
Stanford and you have these great,
amazing celebrities all talking about

26
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:13,200
renewable energy,
the people have to get it done.

27
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,840
We have to get it done.
We have to say,

28
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:18,450
you know what?
I don't want to buy oil and gas and coal

29
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,810
to heat my home to power my home
anymore.

30
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,510
I don't want to do that anymore.
I want to get off of it.

31
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,490
You know?
Um,

32
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,840
some of the resources are very
expensive,

33
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:30,840
like buying an electric car that's out
of the range for a lot of people.

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,960
But getting solar on your roof actually
is economic.

35
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,890
It makes sense.
Getting a buying locally sourced wind

36
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:40,940
power is possible in a lot of states.
It's not in California,

37
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,350
I don't think,
but it is in New York state.

38
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,230
There's a company called ethical
electric that we have a link

39
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:49,650
to@ourwebsitesolutionsgrassroots.com.
Or you can just basically say,

40
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,390
you know what?
I'm going to buy wind power instead of

41
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:54,240
buying electricity from coal or oil or
gas.

42
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,250
And um,
you know,

43
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,570
you've done a huge amount right there.
But the biggest thing that we've done in

44
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:03,300
terms of all this stuff,
New York,

45
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:08,690
by stopping fracking kept the equivalent
of 57 million cars off the road just by

46
00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:15,441
keeping that stuff in the ground there.
And I think the equivalent of taking 72

47
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,610
coal fire power plants offline for a
year,

48
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,420
the movement is actually going to help
solve these things.

49
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,180
Um,
so it's,

50
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,710
it's like how do you get people
together?

51
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:27,300
Well,
we just get together,

52
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,620
have a film screening.

53
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,360
There are a lot of great films on this
stuff.

54
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:34,380
We have a tour,
we have a talk and you start organizing

55
00:02:34,381 --> 00:02:35,580
locally,
I assume happened.

56
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,160
I just bought a new book that I highly
recommend about dolphins.

57
00:02:38,161 --> 00:02:40,800
It's called wet goddess,
but it's available on Amazon.

58
00:02:40,801 --> 00:02:44,730
It's about a relationship basically like
a person in a 50 shades of grey for

59
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:45,564
dolphins.
Yeah,

60
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,300
it really is.
Did you actually read it now?

61
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:50,130
I'm ready.
I just got it just delivered today.

62
00:02:50,131 --> 00:02:51,140
But it's,
it's a,

63
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,400
it's a goddess.
That's so funny,

64
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,790
but it's a,
yeah,

65
00:02:56,791 --> 00:03:00,040
I bought two of them.
You can never have

66
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,720
too many.
I like the cover.

67
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:03,970
It's just like,
it's kind of like a scrapbook with

68
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:05,720
adults.
Why did you buy two?

69
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,100
Why did you buy too?
I just feel like it's not going to be a

70
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:09,940
for,
I don't know.

71
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,310
It's not going to be around for long.
You're holding onto it.

72
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,120
You're going to be a hoarder from
dolphin porn.

73
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:16,721
Well,
look at this.

74
00:03:16,721 --> 00:03:19,330
I mean like they're used,
they're going for $61

75
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:21,911
yeah.
See,

76
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:23,020
I think there's a big mark.
Well look,

77
00:03:23,021 --> 00:03:26,230
this one's 900 wives.
Fuck.

78
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,210
How is that?
Is that probably not all paperback?

79
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,210
That's gotta be the hard copy.
That's to actually get the dolphin to

80
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,350
fuck you.
It's a code code underground.

81
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,840
[inaudible] about,
look at the spout on that Dolphin.

82
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,870
You just buy the book and inside the
book it's just directions to this place

83
00:03:40,871 --> 00:03:42,730
in San Diego.
That's one of the weird things about

84
00:03:42,731 --> 00:03:42,950
people

85
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,320
when it comes to stuff like,
like a dolphin porn or something like

86
00:03:45,321 --> 00:03:45,981
that.
You would think,

87
00:03:45,981 --> 00:03:47,960
well,
who the fuck would be into that?

88
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:50,480
And then you put it online and it
attracts a whole community.

89
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,020
And the next thing you know is a message
board all filled with people that are

90
00:03:54,021 --> 00:03:58,820
talking about their dolphin porn and the
Dolphin love and their kinship of you.

91
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:01,040
If you've heard about that.
Some people,

92
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:04,550
they don't want to be judged by being
akin to certain animals.

93
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:08,480
They feel like their Fox kin,
like they feel connected to a Fox.

94
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,790
I,
I don't,

95
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:11,990
I,
I can't,

96
00:04:11,991 --> 00:04:14,660
uh,
I can sort of understand to a certain

97
00:04:14,661 --> 00:04:16,910
degree.
I did this movie a few years ago and I

98
00:04:16,911 --> 00:04:20,750
had to ride an elephant in it and when I
was standing there with the elephant,

99
00:04:20,751 --> 00:04:24,830
the way the elephant was looking at me
and I was looking at her,

100
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,960
I really felt like,
I was like,

101
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,980
I really love you elephants.
Like I genuinely felt like,

102
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,120
I think I have a crush on this elephant.
Not in a sexual way.

103
00:04:35,121 --> 00:04:36,950
More like,
I just want to hug you and love you.

104
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,860
Yeah.
Trainers have to fall in love with their

105
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,510
animals a lot too.
I don't understand.

106
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,411
Beat them.
I'm like,

107
00:04:41,411 --> 00:04:43,990
stop fucking hitting him.
But that spiked fucking stick.

108
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:44,750
Yeah.

109
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,210
Yeah.
There are people that believe that they

110
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,750
are akin like,
like they're somehow or another,

111
00:04:50,751 --> 00:04:53,090
they should have been this animal
instead of a person.

112
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,070
You know?
Some people think that they were born

113
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:56,780
male,
but they really should have been a

114
00:04:56,781 --> 00:04:57,351
woman.
Yeah.

115
00:04:57,351 --> 00:04:59,600
Some people think that they were born a
person,

116
00:04:59,601 --> 00:05:01,010
but they should have been an elephant.

117
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,070
Yeah.
That's,

118
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,330
that's a,
that's a little mental.

119
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:07,640
Is it though for you to judge?
I'm just saying people don't,

120
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,840
people don't understand does it?
There's a whole tumbler blog about it.

121
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:13,723
Good Lord.

122
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,170
Do they try to manifest physically into
these things?

123
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,450
Uh,
well some of those folks that are

124
00:05:22,451 --> 00:05:24,220
fluffy's are furries.

125
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:32,050
Gabriel,
and he's flapping.

126
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,910
Yeah.
Some of those people,

127
00:05:33,911 --> 00:05:35,900
I'm sure that's what they're doing
there.

128
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,260
They're wishing that they actually were
some weird animal.

129
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,660
Yeah.
I think that's escapism.

130
00:05:40,661 --> 00:05:43,350
What do you think?
I think a lot of what people do is

131
00:05:43,351 --> 00:05:47,380
escape is I'm including being into shit
that everybody just accepts.

132
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,320
Like being in a dungeons and dragons,
that's escapism.

133
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,900
Being into cosplay.
That's escapism.

134
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,300
Like at what point do we decide it's
fucked up?

135
00:05:55,301 --> 00:05:58,940
Like it's okay if you want to dress up
and reenact the civil war,

136
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,150
why is it fucked up?
If you want to pretend you're a fox,

137
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,970
like you're not a soldier from 1800
you'd Douchebag,

138
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,400
okay?
You're an asshole who wishes the south

139
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:10,160
one and you're putting on some ancient
stuff and using a musket,

140
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,960
right?
That's what you're doing.

141
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,430
W you know,
why isn't it?

142
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:18,230
Why is that okay for you to pretend you
were born Arrow with no internet for you

143
00:06:18,231 --> 00:06:20,480
to pretend that you were born in the
time where there's no cars?

144
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,610
That's okay,
but it's not okay to pretend you're a

145
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:24,020
fox.
Hey,

146
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,800
see what I'm saying?
It's not okay to be a Fox show live and

147
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:30,530
let live,
live and let die.

148
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,920
It yourself to see dad,
Dad,

149
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,200
Dad,
Dad,

150
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:35,840
Dad,
dad.
