1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,530
Hello Freak bitches,
a lot of times it's just giving people

2
00:00:04,531 --> 00:00:05,990
information right then and there and
saying,

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,780
you know,
getting people riled up and excited and

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,000
giving them the support to do it.
So,

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,810
um,
we're going to do about a 40 city tour

6
00:00:15,811 --> 00:00:18,990
of solutions grassroots in New York
state in February and March,

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,300
so we'll do like three or four towns a
day.

8
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:22,301
Um,
and I'll,

9
00:00:22,301 --> 00:00:27,301
I'll be doing that with Zephyr teachout
who was incredibly popular candidate for

10
00:00:27,601 --> 00:00:30,960
governor who won 35 percent of the vote
against Andrew Cuomo and his last

11
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:32,190
election.
Um,

12
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,820
and the number of musical guests,
I think we're going to be doing that in

13
00:00:35,821 --> 00:00:38,550
February and March.
We'd love to do the solutions grassroots

14
00:00:38,551 --> 00:00:40,730
tour in California.
Um,

15
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:43,440
love to do it in other states.
So you can go to solutions

16
00:00:43,441 --> 00:00:45,240
grassroots.com.
You can sign up there.

17
00:00:45,241 --> 00:00:48,420
You go there.
There are links that directly you can

18
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:49,240
buy solar.

19
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,700
Uh,
you can buy wind power,

20
00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:53,040
you can do all of that at a consumer
level.

21
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,290
But more importantly,
what we're trying to do with solutions

22
00:00:55,291 --> 00:01:00,291
grassroots is get grassroots energy
movement towards getting ourselves off

23
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:03,150
fossil fuels.
Because you know this,

24
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,040
even though like you can map this out at
Stanford and you have these great,

25
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,190
amazing celebrities all talking about
renewable energy,

26
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,090
the people have to get it done.
We have to get it done.

27
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,200
We have to say,
you know what,

28
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:21,201
I don't want to buy oil and gas and coal
to heat my home to power my home

29
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,370
anymore.
I don't want to do that anymore.

30
00:01:23,371 --> 00:01:24,900
I want to get off of it.
You know?

31
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,240
Um,
some of the resources are very

32
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:29,520
expensive,
like buying an electric car that's out

33
00:01:29,521 --> 00:01:33,000
of the range for a lot of people.
But getting solar on your roof actually

34
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:33,960
is economic.

35
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,890
It makes sense.
Getting a buying locally sourced wind

36
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:41,010
power is possible in a lot of states.
It's not in California,

37
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,930
I don't think,
but it is in New York.

38
00:01:42,931 --> 00:01:46,890
Stated there's a company called ethical
electric that we have a link to at our

39
00:01:46,891 --> 00:01:48,450
website solutions.
Grassroots.com.

40
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,010
Or you can just basically say,
you know what,

41
00:01:50,011 --> 00:01:53,760
I'm going to buy wind power instead of
buying electricity from coal or oil or

42
00:01:53,761 --> 00:01:55,430
gas.
And um,

43
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,230
you know,
you've done a huge amount right there.

44
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,710
But the biggest thing that we've done in
terms of all this stuff,

45
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,170
New York,
by stopping fracking kept the equivalent

46
00:02:07,171 --> 00:02:11,940
of $57 million cars off the road just by
keeping that stuff in the ground there.

47
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,480
And I think the equivalent of taking 72
coal fire power plants offline for a

48
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,400
year,
the movement is actually going to help

49
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:21,860
solve these things.
Um,

50
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,710
so it's like,
how do you get people together?

51
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,330
Well,
we just get together.

52
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,060
We have a film screening.
There are a lot of great films on this

53
00:02:30,061 --> 00:02:31,440
stuff.
We have a tour,

54
00:02:31,441 --> 00:02:34,800
we have a talk and you start organizing
locally.

55
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,990
I it happen.
I just bought a new book that I highly

56
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:39,390
recommend about dolphins called wet
goddess,

57
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,780
but it's available on Amazon.
It's about a relationship because the

58
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:46,270
only person in 50 shades of grey for
dolphins really?

59
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,840
Did you actually read it now?
I haven't read it yet.

60
00:02:48,841 --> 00:02:51,440
I just got delivered today.
But it's here.

61
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,420
It's like God,
it's so funny.

62
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,740
But it's A.
Yeah,

63
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,040
I bought two of them.
You can never have

64
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,720
too many,
but I like the cover.

65
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:03,970
It's just like,
it's kind of like a scrapbook with

66
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:05,750
adults.
Why did you buy two?

67
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,110
Why did you bite too?
I just feel like it's not going to be A.

68
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,910
I don't know.
It's not going to be around for.

69
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,580
You're holding onto it.
You're going to be a hoarder for dolphin

70
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,321
porn.
What?

71
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:19,330
Look at this.
I mean like they used are going for $61.

72
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:21,910
Yeah.
See,

73
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,060
I think there's a big mark.
Oh look,

74
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:28,060
this one,
how has that is probably not the paper

75
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:29,290
bag.
That's got to be the hard copy.

76
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:34,710
That's to actually get the dolphin to
fuck you code the code underground about

77
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:39,220
look at the spout on that Dolphin.
You just buy the book and inside the

78
00:03:39,221 --> 00:03:41,620
book it's just directions to this place
in San Diego.

79
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,200
That's one of the weird things about
people when it comes to stuff like like

80
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:44,720
a dolphin

81
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,980
porn or something like that.
You would think,

82
00:03:45,981 --> 00:03:49,340
well who the fuck would be into that?
And then you put it online and it

83
00:03:49,341 --> 00:03:51,730
attracts a whole community.
Next thing you know,

84
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,680
there's a message board all filled with
people that are talking about their

85
00:03:54,681 --> 00:03:58,460
dolphin porn and the dolphin love and
their kinship.

86
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,040
Have you heard about that?
Some people,

87
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:04,550
they don't want to be judged by being
akin to certain animals.

88
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,650
They feel like they're fox can,
like,

89
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,480
they feel connected to a Fox.

90
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,790
I,
I don't,

91
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,990
I,
I can't,

92
00:04:11,991 --> 00:04:14,660
uh,
I can sort of understand to a certain

93
00:04:14,661 --> 00:04:16,910
degree.
I did this movie a few years ago and I

94
00:04:16,911 --> 00:04:20,750
had to write an elephant in it and when
I was standing there with the elephant,

95
00:04:20,751 --> 00:04:24,830
the way the elephant was looking at me
and I was looking at her,

96
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,050
I really felt like I was like,
I really love you.

97
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:32,480
It,
I genuinely felt like I think I have a

98
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:35,090
crush on this elephant.
Not in a sexual way.

99
00:04:35,091 --> 00:04:36,950
More like,
I just want to hug you and love you.

100
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,870
Yeah.
Trainers have to fall in love with their

101
00:04:38,871 --> 00:04:41,000
animals a lot,
so I don't understand when they beat

102
00:04:41,001 --> 00:04:42,430
them,
I'm like stuck fucking hitting him with

103
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,970
that spiked fucking stick.

104
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,911
Yeah.
Yeah.

105
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:48,980
There are people that believe that they
are akin like,

106
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,320
like they're somehow or another,
they should have been this animal

107
00:04:52,321 --> 00:04:53,490
instead of a person.
You know,

108
00:04:53,491 --> 00:04:56,070
some people think that they were born
male,

109
00:04:56,071 --> 00:04:57,060
but they really should have been a
woman.

110
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,580
Some people think that they were born a
person,

111
00:04:59,581 --> 00:05:02,070
but they should have been an elephant of
the shit that's,

112
00:05:02,071 --> 00:05:03,390
that's a,
that's a little mental.

113
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:08,870
Is it though for you to judge people?
Don't people don't understand there's a,

114
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,620
there's a whole tumbler blog about it.
Good Lord.

115
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:15,970
Do they

116
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:19,180
try to manifest physically into these
things?

117
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,070
Uh,
well,

118
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:24,220
some of those folks that are fluffy's
are furries.

119
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:30,180
Gabriel,
he's.

120
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,120
And he's flapping.
Yeah.

121
00:05:33,121 --> 00:05:35,610
Some of those people.
I'm sure that's what they're doing.

122
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,250
They're wishing that they actually were
some weird animal.

123
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,680
Yeah,
I think that's escapism.

124
00:05:40,681 --> 00:05:43,380
What do you think?
I think a lot of what people do as

125
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,560
escapism,
including being into shit that everybody

126
00:05:46,561 --> 00:05:49,410
just accepts,
like being in a dungeons and dragons,

127
00:05:49,411 --> 00:05:51,900
that's escapism.
Being into cars play.

128
00:05:51,901 --> 00:05:54,720
That's escapism.
Like at what point do we decide it's

129
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:57,650
fucked up?
Like it's okay if you want to up and

130
00:05:57,651 --> 00:06:00,740
reenact the civil war.
Why is it fucked up?

131
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:04,160
If you want to pretend you're fox,
like you're not a soldier from 1800,

132
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,690
you douchebag.
Okay?

133
00:06:05,691 --> 00:06:09,050
You're an asshole who wishes the south
one and you're putting on some ancient

134
00:06:09,051 --> 00:06:10,790
stuff and using a musket,
right?

135
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,450
That's what you're doing.
Well,

136
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:15,440
why isn't it?
Why is that okay for you to pretend you

137
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:19,460
were born Arrow with no internet for you
to pretend that you were born in the

138
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:21,170
time where there's no cars.
That's okay,

139
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,090
but it's not okay to pretend you're a
fox.

140
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:28,690
Hey Sam saying it's not okay to be a fox
to live and let live love live and let

141
00:06:30,151 --> 00:06:31,690
die it yourself.
Oh,

142
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,220
did you see on the
data dot?

143
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:35,930
No.
No.
