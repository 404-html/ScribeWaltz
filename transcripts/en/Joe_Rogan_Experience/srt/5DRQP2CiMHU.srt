25
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:54,041

47
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:22,990
I enjoyed it though.

48
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:23,260

49
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,400
it's an enjoyable film.

50
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:26,080

It's a big Hollywood movie
with Brad Pitt and it's PG 13.

53
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:32,890
This is a certain amount of
fuckery afoot unavoidable.

00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:33,930
Anyway.

55
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:34,480

sexy android phones or their service.

69
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,320
If you've never used or heard of Ting,

70
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,230
I'm assuming you haven't
used him otherwise.

71
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,180
I'm just wasting my fucking time here.

72
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,470
Maybe you have,

73
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,920
and maybe you've heard this
podcast a million times.

74
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:13,690
It's also possible there's no other
way to do this commercial folks.

75
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,553
So I got to plow through.

76
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:15,683
Um,

77
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,560
with ting is a,

78
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:23,010
a cell phone company that uses the
sprint backbone so it's all very high end

79
00:02:23,441 --> 00:02:25,030
service and uh,

80
00:02:25,031 --> 00:02:27,130
they tried to do it in a,

81
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,630
like a very reasonable way.

82
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,040
If you want to cancel,

83
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,030
you can cancel at anytime.

84
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,350
You don't have any contracts.

85
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,620
You also get credit on unused service.

86
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:38,340
If you don't use a certain amount of your,

87
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:39,011
your service,

88
00:02:39,011 --> 00:02:41,260
they'll drop you down to the next level,

89
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,430
which is really beautiful.

90
00:02:42,431 --> 00:02:43,030
If you lose,

91
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,060
use less than you thought you would take,

92
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:49,210
drops you down to the next level and
they credit the difference on your next

93
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:49,840
bill.

94
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,320
It's awesome.

95
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:50,861
Love Tank,

96
00:02:50,861 --> 00:02:51,160
man.

97
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:51,720
I used them,

98
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,040
uh,

99
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,150
two days ago at this place that I had my,

100
00:02:55,151 --> 00:02:55,410
uh,

101
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,890
eight t iPhone and I couldn't get service
there and he like good data service.

102
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,030
I tried my iPad,

103
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:02,140
which is Verizon could,

104
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:02,810
same thing,

105
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:03,221
pull it out.

106
00:03:03,221 --> 00:03:05,920
My Ting device was used
streaming on their network,

107
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:06,250
uh,

108
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,020
from the comedy store and it was just,

109
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:08,450
yeah,

110
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:11,440
it was doing [inaudible]
has always had sprint.

111
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:12,190
That's right.

112
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:12,341
Yeah.

113
00:03:12,341 --> 00:03:14,290
I guess Brent works in places of Verizon.

114
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:15,140
Doesn't versus me.

115
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,100
No one's perfect at this point in time.

116
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:22,060
But what they're trying to do at
Ting is just give you an option,

117
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:26,110
an option that's easier to swallow and
a it's cool company and we enjoy doing

118
00:03:26,111 --> 00:03:29,890
business with them and go to [inaudible]
dot [inaudible] dot com so he shows how

119
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,270
some money you dirty bitch.

120
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,540
We're also boss.

121
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,141
Finally,

122
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:35,801
this is the last one,

123
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:39,340
I swear to God and on it
but on it's just a given.

124
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,593
I'll try to make it funny.

125
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,010
Uh,

126
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,990
legal zoom.com is our last sponsor,

127
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,240
a legal zoom.com is a
website that essentially the,

128
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:53,270
they lay the framework for legal issues
that you would normally have to go to a

129
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,760
lawyer for and pay a lot of money.

130
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:58,750
Um,

131
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:03,750
and what legal zoom wants to emphasize
very clearly is there not a law firm.

132
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:09,570
They provide self help services at your
specific direction and they can also

133
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:14,110
connect you with an independent attorney
if you need additional guidance.

134
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,360
What they are therefore is to make it
much easier to do things like incorporate

135
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:22,420
or form an LLC.

136
00:04:22,421 --> 00:04:24,670
You can do it@legalzoom.com for just six.

137
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:27,280
We're just $99 sex on him.

138
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:28,210
Nora came sex.

139
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,680
It's cause it's evil legal,

140
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:30,281
legal stuffs,

141
00:04:30,281 --> 00:04:30,730
eval.

142
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:31,341
I was thinking six,

143
00:04:31,341 --> 00:04:31,511
six,

144
00:04:31,511 --> 00:04:31,751
six.

145
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:32,584
It's really nice.

146
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:33,640
Um,

147
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,320
they can also help you
out with trademarks,

148
00:04:35,321 --> 00:04:36,101
copyrights,

149
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:36,791
patents.

150
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:37,780
If you've got a great idea.

151
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:38,710
You want to protect.

152
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:39,610
If you're with family,

153
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:40,391
you can make a well.

154
00:04:40,391 --> 00:04:40,710
Yeah.

155
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:41,160
You know what?

156
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:41,651
That's crazy.

157
00:04:41,651 --> 00:04:42,484
None of us have wheels.

158
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:42,771
I was,

159
00:04:42,771 --> 00:04:44,320
I was talking to my friends
the other day about that.

160
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:44,501
It's like,

161
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:44,741
do you have a,

162
00:04:44,741 --> 00:04:45,040
well,

163
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,400
no.

164
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,060
What happens?

165
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:46,361
Well,

166
00:04:46,361 --> 00:04:47,250
if you live in California,

167
00:04:47,251 --> 00:04:48,220
her parents live in California.

168
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:49,480
California gets all your shit.

169
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,880
Unless your parents breaking in
your house and steal everything.

170
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:52,781
Really?

171
00:04:52,781 --> 00:04:53,110
Yeah.

172
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:53,870
I think it's the foreign,

173
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:54,760
he gets all your shit.

174
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,380
I might be 100%

175
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,190
no,

176
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,370
but I guess there is a thing
if you don't have a will,

177
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,263
it doesn't automate.

178
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,310
You think it just automatically
goes to your family.

179
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,170
But that's not always the case.

180
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:05,500
Know what?

181
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,000
I assume there would be a pain in the ass.

182
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,000
The side.

183
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,221
Right.

184
00:05:08,221 --> 00:05:09,550
Especially if you're living with someone,

185
00:05:09,551 --> 00:05:11,140
like if you're living with a
girl or something like that,

186
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,350
that girl has a key to your house and
she knows you're dead and just comes over

187
00:05:14,351 --> 00:05:15,184
and takes your shit.

188
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:15,881
That's how I know a little,

189
00:05:15,881 --> 00:05:16,061
a little.

190
00:05:16,061 --> 00:05:16,830
She cares about you.

191
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,420
No doubt.

192
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,510
I told me that was mine with you.

193
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,340
Don't say who would be like seven girls.

194
00:05:21,341 --> 00:05:22,780
All budding heads trying
to get in the door.

195
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:25,180
It has the area and I dare you there.

196
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,470
You just,

197
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:27,370
there was a humble brag.

198
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:27,831
No,

199
00:05:27,831 --> 00:05:28,210
no.

200
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:28,580
Anyways,

201
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,150
we will zoom legal,

202
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,270
zoom.com.

203
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,220
It's a not a law firm.

204
00:05:33,221 --> 00:05:34,050
Remember,

205
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:34,530
it's a,

206
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,520
they're just trying to help you out.

207
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,390
Um,

208
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:40,660
and I know there's like some
code and I'm supposed to use,

209
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,210
but of course it's not on this copy.

210
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,810
I think it's just the code name is Rogan.

211
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,330
But let me just make sure you
get all these guys together.

212
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,000
Just make it Rogan for everything.

213
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,200
I know it would be nice,

214
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,050
but it's not that way.

215
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,010
Bet You lose a lot of

216
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:58,641
people that are just like,

217
00:05:58,641 --> 00:05:58,971
fuck it.

218
00:05:58,971 --> 00:05:59,870
I don't know it.

219
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,850
I'm just whatever.

220
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:02,600
Yeah.

221
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,440
Probably right?

222
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:03,801
Yeah.

223
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:04,431
It's a code name.

224
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:05,000
Rogan.

225
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,330
Oh,

226
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:05,541
sorry.

227
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:06,410
I was writing from my face.

228
00:06:06,411 --> 00:06:06,761
Not only that,

229
00:06:06,761 --> 00:06:07,594
it's highlighted,

230
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:08,290

232
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,390

233
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:14,630
Rogan in the referral box and
checkout for more savings.

234
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,550
That's legal zoom.com.

235
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,960
You always have to say
it like that at the end,

236
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,100
cause that makes you more professional.

237
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:19,941
If you just go,

238
00:06:19,941 --> 00:06:20,241
okay,

239
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:22,280
that fucking commercial's over next.

240
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:23,960
Like a theatrical ending.

241
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,550
I'm surprised you don't have
to do of those like quick,

242
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:29,510
fast talking things like Tom Segura
on their podcast and I have something,

243
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:30,920
has something similar at the end.

244
00:06:30,921 --> 00:06:31,970
They have to do one of those nine,

245
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:35,180
the representative they
really like and it's like,

246
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,400
they really amazing.

247
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,640
It's weird.

248
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,370
We're,

249
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:40,760
well,

250
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,100
someone's going to tell us what
to actually say on the podcast.

251
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:45,680
I'm cool with almost anything
that's a reasonable ad.

252
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,070
Right?

253
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,903
It makes sense.

254
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,110
If it's something I would use number,

255
00:06:48,111 --> 00:06:48,944
totally use this.

256
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,500
I've used this as long
as it makes sense to me,

257
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:52,610
but uh,

258
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:53,060
that's,

259
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,080
that doesn't make sense.

260
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:58,170
I'm not reading off any
following Connecticut.

261
00:06:58,410 --> 00:06:59,020
All right.

262
00:06:59,020 --> 00:06:59,260
Dot.

263
00:06:59,260 --> 00:06:59,540
Coms.

264
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,290
The last sponsor,

265
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:00,531
O,

266
00:07:00,531 --> 00:07:00,831
n,

267
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:01,100
n.

268
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:01,700
I.

269
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:01,701
T.

270
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:02,570
If you've never been,

271
00:07:02,571 --> 00:07:03,650
go check it out.

272
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,270
Get yourself some fitness equipment.

273
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,240
We've got a lot of new shit.

274
00:07:06,241 --> 00:07:10,070
And if you haven't been into the
website before in to the website,

275
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,720
I don't think you go into a website.

276
00:07:11,721 --> 00:07:14,690
If you go onto a website
and why is it on and not in?

277
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,010
I mean you're not really on it.

278
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,113
What are you doing?

279
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,950
What are you doing when
you go onto a website,

280
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,120
you're going on,

281
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,023
are you going in it?

282
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,540
You're actually entering into it to it,

283
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,240
and then what do you do
to go in or do go on it.

284
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,590
So I'm on the website.

285
00:07:27,591 --> 00:07:28,250
You're on the website,

286
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:28,341
right?

287
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:29,174
But why is it on?

288
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,080
Because you're like,

289
00:07:30,081 --> 00:07:30,621
you're on it.

290
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:32,360
You're facing molecule in though,

291
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:33,710
were in the website.

292
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,450
You're clicking different pages.

293
00:07:35,451 --> 00:07:35,761
You're like,

294
00:07:35,761 --> 00:07:36,590
you know a book.

295
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:36,771
Oh,

296
00:07:36,771 --> 00:07:38,150
I'm 50 pages into my book.

297
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,680
Or you're in most websites,

298
00:07:39,681 --> 00:07:40,670
like your pictures and stuff.

299
00:07:40,671 --> 00:07:42,770
So I think that's more
confusing to most people.

300
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:43,701
Me,

301
00:07:43,701 --> 00:07:44,750
I'm in most weapons.

302
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:46,850
Most people go to a website,

303
00:07:46,851 --> 00:07:47,684
they're not in it.

304
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,370
Well then what do you mean like on it

305
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,350
to do retarded?

306
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:53,451
I'm talking to you.

307
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:54,284
I'm being serious.

308
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,360
I'm never going to stop
saying retarded either.

309
00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:00,020
Fuck you tried to take
weight training now.

310
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:00,980
How dare you?

311
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,000
That's so hard.

312
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,410
I'm taking retard back.

313
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:04,543
Just some,

314
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,740
I'm putting more words
back into the vernacular.

315
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,120
You know what I'm talking about?

316
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:09,360
I'm not talking about diseases,

317
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,030
dummy.

318
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,200
There's the retarded
tranny somewhere going,

319
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:13,730
oh,

320
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:16,640
I can't believe you did
the voice on the.com.

321
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:17,180
Uh,

322
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,220
the new prime bells are in a,

323
00:08:19,221 --> 00:08:20,440
if you haven't seen them there,

324
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,170
this,

325
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:26,170
we hired this awesome sculptor to draw
these angry chimpanzee faces for a kettle

326
00:08:26,471 --> 00:08:27,200
bells,

327
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:27,620
uh,

328
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,870
gives you a little bit of extra
motivation when you're working out.

329
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,950
I like to picture that chimp clamping
down on my scrotum with his teeth.

330
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,530
That gets me through the
last four or five Reps.

331
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:37,250
Uh,

332
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,840
if you've never used kettlebells before,

333
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,030
what they are is in my opinion,

334
00:08:41,031 --> 00:08:44,450
one of the very best strength and
conditioning exercise equipment,

335
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,970
pieces of exercise equipment
that you can buy there,

336
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,970
a Russian invention and it's like
a cannon ball with a handle on it.

337
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,750
And he's swinging him around and
you use your entire body in these,

338
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,020
uh,

339
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:54,853
these movements.

340
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:59,280
And I find that that's what really
applies to not just physical,

341
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,290
um,

342
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,050
uh,

343
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:01,883
sports.

344
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,140
But if just if physical movement,

345
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,153
physical movement,

346
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,050
like I'm picking things up,

347
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:08,880
the ability to move
stuff around your house,

348
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:09,000
you,

349
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,350
you,

350
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,760
you gain a balance sort of strength.

351
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,470
Whereas a lot of people,

352
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,270
one of the problems with people who,

353
00:09:15,271 --> 00:09:15,690
uh,

354
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:19,350
don't use a professional trainer or
don't exactly know what you're doing.

355
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,600
You can develop imbalances,

356
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,050
uh,

357
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,390
with your body because maybe
you use your arms too much.

358
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:26,970
You don't use your legs enough
or vice verse and it can be,

359
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,013
it can be a mess.

360
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,070
Um,

361
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,590
one of the best things you can
do if you're going to think,

362
00:09:31,591 --> 00:09:35,490
if you're thinking about kettle bells
or any kind of exercise thing is to hire

363
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,350
someone who's really good,

364
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,240
who can show you what to do.

365
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,550
You can learn a lot of stuff from youtube,

366
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,900
but you really should have someone sort
of correcting subtle things in the way

367
00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:46,734
you're moving,

368
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,480
just to make sure that you have good form.

369
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,700
Use a lightweight to begin with,

370
00:09:50,701 --> 00:09:54,810
try to try to be very reasonable about
what you're trying to do and then build,

371
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,111
right.

372
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:56,670
You're right it down and build.

373
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,260
And when you do do that,

374
00:09:58,261 --> 00:10:01,800
you will get an immense
set sense of satisfaction.

375
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,280
The sense of satisfaction that you get
from pushing your body and getting your

376
00:10:05,281 --> 00:10:07,170
body into a good state
of physical fitness.

377
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:08,700
It's not just a vanity thing,

378
00:10:08,701 --> 00:10:10,110
it's really good for your health.

379
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:11,580
And uh,

380
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,503
you know,

381
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,160
I talk about it all the time,

382
00:10:14,161 --> 00:10:17,760
but it's very hard for people to stop
eating donuts and get off the couch.

383
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:23,040
It's very difficult to choose to have a
salad instead of a shitty cheeseburger.

384
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,413
It's hard.

385
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,470
It's hard to get your shit together.

386
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:28,680
But if you can get your shit
together even just a little bit,

387
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,693
you'll feel better.

388
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,450
That's a fact.

389
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,070
I lost eight pounds in two weeks.

390
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,953
Have you really?

391
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:34,650
And that's after quitting smoking,

392
00:10:34,651 --> 00:10:37,500
which is like usually a gain
weight with a few you sexy bitch.

393
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,300
Brian Ryko looking at health,

394
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:39,960
he's a,

395
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,640
he's cutting back on his coughing.

396
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,630
He's doing all kinds of shit.

397
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,191
Next thing you know it,

398
00:10:43,191 --> 00:10:44,280
but taking t plus,

399
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,743
I need some of that.

400
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:46,410
Get some,

401
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:46,950
we got some,

402
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:47,783
I'll give you some,

403
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,840
I'll bring you some,

404
00:10:48,841 --> 00:10:49,674
a next podcast.

405
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,513
Cool.

406
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:51,061
All right.

407
00:10:51,061 --> 00:10:51,630
That's the end.

408
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:51,950
Uh,

409
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,190
use the coordinate Brogan.

410
00:10:53,191 --> 00:10:53,911
That's r o,

411
00:10:53,911 --> 00:10:58,260
g a n and you will save 10%
off any and all supplements.

412
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:58,591
All right,

413
00:10:58,591 --> 00:10:59,190
my friends,

414
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:03,360
Rick Doblin is here and we are going
to get to the bottom of some shit.

415
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,220
Please cue the music

416
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,960
experience podcast by night.

417
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,050
He made it.

418
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:19,883
I did.

419
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,210
Rick Joplin,

420
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:24,930
who is the head of maps or if you uh,

421
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,790
have never heard whether the,

422
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,370
it's called an acronym where
it's maps or is it yeah,

423
00:11:29,371 --> 00:11:29,641
it is.

424
00:11:29,641 --> 00:11:30,030
Cause it's,

425
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,730
you say it right when you don't say it.

426
00:11:31,731 --> 00:11:32,700
It's an abbreviation.

427
00:11:32,701 --> 00:11:35,640
Is that what it is or which we
tried to figure that out once.

428
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:36,690
Um,

429
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,660
but it stands for the
multicultural as far it is,

430
00:11:39,661 --> 00:11:40,441
what Google is for it.

431
00:11:40,441 --> 00:11:41,850
But somehow or another,

432
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:42,840
I'm not quite,

433
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,280
I don't totally have it together.

434
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,790
Multidisciplinary Association
for Psychedelic Studies.

435
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:48,271
Uh,

436
00:11:48,271 --> 00:11:49,380
you founded this.

437
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:49,800
Yeah.

438
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,270
And I was surprised to discover it.

439
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,160
It has the most syllables
of any organization in

440
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,410
the nonprofit world for drug reform

441
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,303
really?

442
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:57,940
Well,

443
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,190
it's a very interesting title,

444
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,640
Multidisciplinary Association
for Psychedelic Studies.

445
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:04,900
That's what I love about it.

446
00:12:04,901 --> 00:12:07,480
It's like you're coming at it from
a whole bunch of different angles.

447
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,310
So as he just doctors,

448
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:11,200
it's not just chemists,

449
00:12:11,201 --> 00:12:13,180
it's a whole bunch of human beings.

450
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:13,711
Yeah.

451
00:12:13,711 --> 00:12:17,820
And I had learned from a previous
nonprofit that when you want to create a

452
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:18,481
nonprofit,

453
00:12:18,481 --> 00:12:21,780
it's good to try to make
it as broad as possible.

454
00:12:21,781 --> 00:12:25,140
The purpose as you see different
strategic ways to do things.

455
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:28,200
So I made it multidisciplinary,

456
00:12:28,201 --> 00:12:32,250
which means we could look at psychedelics
from virtually any perspective,

457
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:32,960
um,

458
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:37,050
association to mean that it's
publicly supported a nonprofit.

459
00:12:37,051 --> 00:12:38,250
And I had images of,

460
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:38,700
you know,

461
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,630
tens of thousands of people banding
together to support research in different

462
00:12:42,631 --> 00:12:43,464
areas.

463
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,400
Um,

464
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,550
psychedelic was a big choice,

465
00:12:47,551 --> 00:12:47,911
actually,

466
00:12:47,911 --> 00:12:49,170
whether we should use the word,

467
00:12:49,171 --> 00:12:50,700
whether we should use a different word,

468
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,780
whether we should use a euphemism.

469
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:00,060
And so I felt like I wanted in this kind
of second coming of psychedelics into

470
00:13:00,061 --> 00:13:05,010
the culture 40 years after the crackdown
that I wanted there to be a certain

471
00:13:05,011 --> 00:13:05,910
transparency.

472
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:10,140
And so I wanted to use the
word psychedelics so people
knew what I was doing and

473
00:13:10,141 --> 00:13:14,910
I was hoping that we can change the
cultural connotations from what it was in

474
00:13:14,911 --> 00:13:16,590
the 60s of psychedelics,

475
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:16,980
uh,

476
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,730
rebellion,

477
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:18,690
dropping out,

478
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:19,680
uh,

479
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,011
you know,

480
00:13:20,011 --> 00:13:23,550
finding your own sort of
private utopia somewhere,

481
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,481
certain kind of,

482
00:13:24,481 --> 00:13:25,314
um,

483
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,810
not integrated into the culture.

484
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,100
And now that's,

485
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:34,101
I think the arc of the story
is psychedelics came at a
time when culture wasn't

486
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:37,260
really ready and brought all
sorts of things to the surface.

487
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,940
And over the last 40 years,

488
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:42,180
our culture has gotten
ready with hospice centers,

489
00:13:42,181 --> 00:13:43,230
with birthing centers,

490
00:13:43,231 --> 00:13:44,190
with Yoga,

491
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:44,851
meditation,

492
00:13:44,851 --> 00:13:46,500
all the things with flotation tanks,

493
00:13:46,501 --> 00:13:50,010
all the things that were too
hard to integrate at the time,

494
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,610
death and birth and
just raw emotions that,

495
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:58,260
and also this globalization and
growing sense of global spirituality.

496
00:13:58,261 --> 00:14:02,970
Now our culture is ready and I think we
can over the next 10 20 years integrates

497
00:14:02,971 --> 00:14:05,640
psychedelics without the
connotation of rebellion.

498
00:14:05,641 --> 00:14:07,500
But to enhance what
we're all doing together.

499
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,561
That's interesting.

500
00:14:08,561 --> 00:14:12,250
I like the use of the word psycho dogs
cause you're owning it and that is what

501
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:13,390
it's about and you know,

502
00:14:13,391 --> 00:14:13,991
and it's,

503
00:14:13,991 --> 00:14:17,650
it's shouldn't be something that people
are afraid of or afraid of adding to

504
00:14:17,651 --> 00:14:22,120
something because it'll somehow or
another make it silly or make it,

505
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,650
oh psychedelics.

506
00:14:23,651 --> 00:14:23,891
You know,

507
00:14:23,891 --> 00:14:26,710
people want to dismiss it
and they can much easier.

508
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:28,020
Owning it is,

509
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,420
is I think is very important.

510
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,360
And there's no other
word that's even better.

511
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:31,781
No.

512
00:14:31,781 --> 00:14:33,670
Hallucinogen was used by the government.

513
00:14:33,671 --> 00:14:34,960
It's like you're fake.

514
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:35,250
Yes.

515
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,700
I don't like that feeling either.

516
00:14:36,701 --> 00:14:40,180
Hallucinogen always makes me feel like
I'm seeing something that's not there.

517
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:40,691
Yeah,

518
00:14:40,691 --> 00:14:41,491
that's the idea.

519
00:14:41,491 --> 00:14:41,611
Yeah.

520
00:14:41,611 --> 00:14:45,400
It's not real and don't know
anything about psychedelics.

521
00:14:45,401 --> 00:14:50,200
They imagined like literally like
imagining someone in the room with you and

522
00:14:50,201 --> 00:14:50,860
that guy,

523
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,010
it doesn't really exist.

524
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:56,390
The word before that in
the 50s was even worse.

525
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,290
It was psycho.

526
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:58,124
My medic.

527
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:58,820
Ooh.

528
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,980
Which means it mimic psychosis.

529
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:02,811
Well it doesn't.

530
00:15:02,811 --> 00:15:04,580
Some people should be careful.

531
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,343
It does.

532
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,690
It does bring in all parts of ourselves.

533
00:15:08,691 --> 00:15:12,080
I think we all have those kind of parts
where they're not really integrated and

534
00:15:12,081 --> 00:15:17,081
it seems extreme and you let the emotions
carry you so that the safe place we

535
00:15:17,901 --> 00:15:19,580
have to be careful I think is true.

536
00:15:19,581 --> 00:15:20,870
But the bad trip,

537
00:15:20,871 --> 00:15:21,950
the difficult challenge,

538
00:15:21,951 --> 00:15:22,671
the death rebirth,

539
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:25,550
it's in all of us as are
these psychotic states.

540
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:25,631
I,

541
00:15:25,631 --> 00:15:30,631
I actually had what I felt was probably
the most psychotic or diluted state of

542
00:15:30,711 --> 00:15:33,950
my whole life was doing
LSD and a flotation tank.

543
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,023
Wow.

544
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:36,800
I can imagine.

545
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,410
So self examine story.

546
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,253
Anyway.

547
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,213
Yeah.

548
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,690
I'm not an LSD person.

549
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:46,040
I never have tried it because I've never
trusted anybody in the right way to get

550
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:46,430
it.

551
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:51,430
But I've done a lot of time in the tank
on especially on high doses of edibles,

552
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:52,363
edible weed,

553
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:55,520
that insanely uncomfortable
feeling that you get.

554
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:56,240
Will you get,

555
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,370
you could examine story about
shit you did in high school.

556
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,870
Like really in depth.

557
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:00,670
Yeah.

558
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:01,220
In high school.

559
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,053
Good for yeah.

560
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:04,700
And the tank does that on its own.

561
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,950
So the tank with that together,

562
00:16:06,951 --> 00:16:07,121
it's,

563
00:16:07,121 --> 00:16:07,640
it's,

564
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,420
whew.

565
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:08,661
Yeah.

566
00:16:08,661 --> 00:16:11,300
Well imagine acid in the tank
would be a similar experience.

567
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:11,990
Yeah.

568
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:15,650
Well I grew up reading
John Lilly in the 1971,

569
00:16:15,651 --> 00:16:16,484
actually,

570
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,860
but it was before that was programming
and Meta programming and the human bio

571
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:22,694
computer.

572
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,700
And that was so technical and complicated.

573
00:16:25,701 --> 00:16:28,850
I had to spend like a whole day on each
page or something that just like cam at

574
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:29,930
figure this stuff out.

575
00:16:29,931 --> 00:16:33,380
It was so early computer discussion,

576
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,990
discussion and language about and
how the brain in that parades,

577
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:36,350
yeah.

578
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,270
He was a real pioneer.

579
00:16:38,271 --> 00:16:39,680
Like a real pioneer.

580
00:16:39,681 --> 00:16:41,120
I mean that dude was out there.

581
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:41,421
Yeah.

582
00:16:41,421 --> 00:16:45,050
But he went too far out and he
wasn't grounded in his last,

583
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:45,800
uh,

584
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,431
30 years.

585
00:16:46,431 --> 00:16:47,870
We're kind of a sad tragedy,

586
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,380
I would say.

587
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,340
Wasted potential.

588
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,030
Um,

589
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,530
it was that because of ketamine,

590
00:16:51,531 --> 00:16:53,840
cause he got involved
heavily with Ketamine,

591
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,720
which has some pretty disastrous results.

592
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,090
Yeah.

593
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:00,920
Ketamine is the most addictive of
all the psychedelics and I physically

594
00:17:00,921 --> 00:17:01,754
addictive,

595
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,530
not so much physically,

596
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:04,491
which,

597
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:05,630
but more this,

598
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:10,190
a reliable escape that and
this delusion of superiority.

599
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,660
So was their withdrawal.

600
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:17,410
I'm not in that same way as heroin or
it's not like physically it's just a

601
00:17:17,991 --> 00:17:22,020
psychological addiction more so
there's a shift in the attitude and,

602
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:26,870
but what I think was the problem
with John Lilly more than before,

603
00:17:26,871 --> 00:17:31,790
the ketamine was a certain kind of
brilliance that was unbalanced and he was

604
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:36,320
kind of arrogant and I don't think he
was patient and he was way ahead of his

605
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:37,154
culture,

606
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:37,581
you know,

607
00:17:37,581 --> 00:17:38,414
way ahead.

608
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,840
And yet when he saw the crackdown calm,

609
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:42,950
I think he,

610
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:47,950
he sort of took this superior position
and just felt like he's not going to work

611
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:49,034
on a

612
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,750
political struggle or even a scientific
struggle to get these tools back.

613
00:17:54,751 --> 00:17:56,910
He kind of withdrew.

614
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,240
And even from boy he just had this um,

615
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,660
somewhat self destructive aspect too.

616
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,040
I read a lot about him and I
met him and I actually ended up,

617
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:13,550
I'm trying to do Mtma therapy with him
when it felt like he was really going

618
00:18:14,611 --> 00:18:18,750
downhill from the ketamine
and from cocaine and wow.

619
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,150
Yeah,

620
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:22,440
that's intense is the
word is kind of my hero.

621
00:18:22,441 --> 00:18:24,870
One of he and Stan Grof,

622
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,610
and I would contrast them that Stan
is doing fantastically as traveling.

623
00:18:29,611 --> 00:18:34,380
The world is totally together and a major
inspiration who is able to integrate

624
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:35,214
into his life.

625
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,420
Whereas John Lilly was,

626
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:40,410
you could say arguably as
brilliant but went off the track.

627
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:41,200
Yeah,

628
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:41,610
it's,

629
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:42,720
it is possible.

630
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:46,440
That's one of the real
issues with anything that
completely alters the way your

631
00:18:46,441 --> 00:18:49,400
mind works is that you could
get into that too much.

632
00:18:49,401 --> 00:18:53,020
She can get into that more than
reality and lose your grip of this one.

633
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:53,501
Well,

634
00:18:53,501 --> 00:18:54,520
it is reality.

635
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,530
It's just a different view of reality.

636
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,653
Um,

637
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:01,390
and I think that the grounding part and
what we emphasize in our psychedelic

638
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:06,391
therapy is that it's the integration
work more than the experience itself that

639
00:19:07,241 --> 00:19:08,740
produces longterm benefits.

640
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:11,230
So then you can have
these unusual experiences,

641
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:16,231
but what do you bring back from them
and how do you integrate that into your

642
00:19:16,241 --> 00:19:20,020
daily practices so that it's anchored
so that you can try to get there without

643
00:19:20,021 --> 00:19:20,854
the drug.

644
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:24,790
It's like this evolution process
where you learn something.

645
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,171
And I've found,

646
00:19:26,171 --> 00:19:27,100
at least for me,

647
00:19:27,101 --> 00:19:30,340
the psychedelics are something that
I can work with through a lifetime,

648
00:19:30,341 --> 00:19:32,410
through a lifespan that I've learned.

649
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,480
Some people say when you get the message,

650
00:19:34,481 --> 00:19:35,380
hang up the phone.

651
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:39,880
And I felt that there's been different
messages at different stages of my life

652
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,580
and that I'm more able,

653
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,440
although it's still really hard,

654
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:44,740
you know,

655
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,760
to hear those things,

656
00:19:45,761 --> 00:19:49,030
those the self critical stuff like
what he did in high school or what,

657
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:49,750
you know,

658
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:54,640
how you try to hear the message
underneath the criticism.

659
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,930
And um,

660
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:58,930
I learned that a lot during
an Ibogaine experience.

661
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:03,880
So I've seen that these experiences
can have these lasting changes,

662
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,350
but that they don't always,

663
00:20:05,351 --> 00:20:06,280
and they don't have to.

664
00:20:06,281 --> 00:20:09,760
And particularly when you had these
experiences that are unbalanced,

665
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:13,690
the drug starts wearing off and
you haven't come to a new balance.

666
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,310
And during those periods,

667
00:20:15,311 --> 00:20:20,311
the best solution at least is to
continue therapy and do another session.

668
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:24,910
And that's where people often back off
and they kind of free something in place

669
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,860
that's at such a deep level.

670
00:20:26,861 --> 00:20:29,980
It's hard to get to that deep
level to move it forward.

671
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,170
Yeah,

672
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,000
it's um,

673
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,280
it's,

674
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,540
it's a very personal thing,

675
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:34,020
isn't it?

676
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,000
Like where you start from to,

677
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:36,271
you know,

678
00:20:36,271 --> 00:20:39,120
for some folks it's like they've already,

679
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,490
they already have issues
with reality itself.

680
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,860
They have issues with being grounded,

681
00:20:43,861 --> 00:20:45,420
with being calm.

682
00:20:45,421 --> 00:20:48,610
And I mean it's some
people you could just,

683
00:20:48,611 --> 00:20:49,001
you know,

684
00:20:49,001 --> 00:20:53,650
you could just get them high or they
could have some sort of psychedelic

685
00:20:53,651 --> 00:20:58,150
experience and they would be able to
assimilate it into their life and they

686
00:20:58,151 --> 00:20:59,860
would benefit from it almost immediately.

687
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:01,840
Whereas other folks almost needed to be.

688
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:06,670
I think education is one of the big
ones that were really lacking in this

689
00:21:06,671 --> 00:21:07,930
country when it comes to these things.

690
00:21:07,931 --> 00:21:10,010
And the word Shaman is such a,

691
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:13,870
such a loaded word
because it's like healer,

692
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:14,231
you know,

693
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,340
when someone says their healer,

694
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:15,950
all of a sudden you,

695
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:16,411
oh,

696
00:21:16,411 --> 00:21:17,350
okay,

697
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:17,981
you know,

698
00:21:17,981 --> 00:21:18,181
what,

699
00:21:18,181 --> 00:21:20,260
what other dumb shit or
you're going to say next,

700
00:21:20,261 --> 00:21:20,710
you know,

701
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:24,580
are hollow therapeutic approaches based
on the idea that there's an inner healer

702
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:28,570
and it's the support that we provide
to help people heal themselves.

703
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:33,220
So there's a power dynamic
often in shamanism where
sometimes the shaman is even

704
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:36,010
the only one that does the
drug and then heels you.

705
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,180
Hmm.

706
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:42,180
It's not teaching you how to heal yourself
so that we have this idea that like

707
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:44,740
the body heals itself.

708
00:21:44,741 --> 00:21:49,420
If you get a cut that the psyche has
these self healing mechanisms and brings

709
00:21:49,421 --> 00:21:54,421
things kind of to the surface so that
it's not so much reality and psychedelic

710
00:21:54,671 --> 00:21:55,061
state.

711
00:21:55,061 --> 00:21:57,310
It's almost like reality and more reality.

712
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,480
And we know that from a Fmri brain
scan studies that were recently done in

713
00:22:03,911 --> 00:22:05,440
England with Psilocybin,

714
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:09,580
that what it does in the
brain is different than what
we had been thinking and

715
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,580
we had been thinking that
it makes the brain speed up,

716
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:13,540
that that you know,

717
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,310
some things work even faster that,

718
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,050
that your perceptions are going.

719
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:21,250
And actually what it does is it
makes parts of the brain slow down,

720
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:26,850
but it's the filtering parts of the
brain so that we have enormous volume of

721
00:22:27,611 --> 00:22:30,280
perceptions coming to us at any one time.

722
00:22:30,281 --> 00:22:33,790
And that's kind of what you can see in
the tank to that when you start quieting

723
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:34,630
everything down,

724
00:22:34,631 --> 00:22:35,464
you can really,

725
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:36,251
you know,

726
00:22:36,251 --> 00:22:37,150
think in different ways.

727
00:22:37,151 --> 00:22:41,860
But we have this enormous amount of
information and we only narrow and look at

728
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:44,990
some of it what we need
to do either for survival,

729
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:50,040
for we focus and the controlling the
filtering parts of the brain are what

730
00:22:50,681 --> 00:22:55,360
psilocybin slows down so
that they work less well.

731
00:22:55,361 --> 00:22:58,300
So you get more of a flood
of what's already there.

732
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:59,730
What is the mechanism,

733
00:22:59,731 --> 00:23:01,160
the filtering parts of the brand.

734
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,590
When you say the filter
in parts of the brand,

735
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:02,861
what,

736
00:23:02,861 --> 00:23:03,694
what are those?

737
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,113
Um,

738
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,140
they're generally linkedin,

739
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:09,720
what's called the default network,

740
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,460
the default mode network.

741
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,110
There's um,

742
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:18,570
and here becomes kind of a practical
side of the work that I do,

743
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:23,630
which is basically trying to develop
a psychedelic drugs into prescription

744
00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:25,410
medicines and marijuana.

745
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,630
So from the FDAS point of view,

746
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:28,500
um,

747
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,570
you have to show something
safe and efficacious,

748
00:23:30,571 --> 00:23:32,700
but you don't have to
explain how it works.

749
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,780
So therefore,

750
00:23:33,781 --> 00:23:35,130
I haven't really focused on that.

751
00:23:35,131 --> 00:23:35,281
So,

752
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:38,280
I don't know the answer
to your question because,

753
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,030
um,

754
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:44,030
it's neuroscience and I don't need
neuroscience to know the exact quadrants,

755
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:45,411
the brain.

756
00:23:45,411 --> 00:23:46,010
So I've kind

757
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:46,843
of got,

758
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:47,923
um,

759
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,960
people I work with and other people I
rely on another scientist to do that part.

760
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:55,910
It helps if you have an
explanatory mechanism,

761
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,280
but at the same time it's not necessary.

762
00:23:58,281 --> 00:24:02,090
So what I've done is tried to be
strategic and tried to focus on the stuff

763
00:24:02,091 --> 00:24:04,370
that's essential to move
the culture forward,

764
00:24:04,371 --> 00:24:08,330
to create legal context for psychedelics
to show that they can be used

765
00:24:08,331 --> 00:24:08,900
responsibly.

766
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,790
Why is asking more for my own edification?

767
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:11,820
I wish I could answer you.

768
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:12,931
I always,

769
00:24:12,931 --> 00:24:13,280
one of the,

770
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:17,870
I think I read that very study
about quieting areas of mine.

771
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:20,340
I thought it was really
fascinating and um,

772
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,310
I attributed it to uh,

773
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:24,590
the,

774
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:27,860
the idea being that we
are filled with noise.

775
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:28,401
You know,

776
00:24:28,401 --> 00:24:30,410
that our mind is filled with noise.

777
00:24:30,411 --> 00:24:33,380
Our mind is filled with concentrating
on a bunch of shit that's not really

778
00:24:33,381 --> 00:24:38,381
important and that that gets shut off
and then you can sort of tune in to

779
00:24:38,391 --> 00:24:41,140
whatever the fuck it is
that you took and uh,

780
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,660
whatever it is that you took
that's doing something and yeah,

781
00:24:44,661 --> 00:24:45,770
I don't see it so much.

782
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:47,930
That stuff is not important,

783
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,000
but it's not as important.

784
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:50,511
I mean,

785
00:24:50,511 --> 00:24:53,210
you need to do certain things
to get through the day,

786
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,520
so you need to have a narrower focus.

787
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:56,410
Maybe not important.

788
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,830
Wasn't even what I should've said.

789
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,410
It's just,

790
00:24:58,410 --> 00:24:59,660
it's not that it's unimportant,

791
00:24:59,661 --> 00:25:02,750
it's just sometimes there are things in
your life that aren't that important,

792
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,530
but they take primary focus,

793
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:06,110
they take center stage,

794
00:25:06,111 --> 00:25:06,381
you know,

795
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:07,720
whether it's an argument that we,

796
00:25:07,721 --> 00:25:10,910
you got with a friend over almost nothing.

797
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,860
Something that can be addressed,

798
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,281
you know,

799
00:25:13,281 --> 00:25:14,870
really easily and quickly probably.

800
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,100
But whatever it is,

801
00:25:16,101 --> 00:25:17,030
it's bothering you.

802
00:25:17,031 --> 00:25:21,050
Should I say something because I really
feel like I'm being slighted and no fuck

803
00:25:21,051 --> 00:25:23,570
with you all day until you actually
have the conversation with the person.

804
00:25:23,571 --> 00:25:24,980
And it can be a million other things.

805
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:27,260
Could it be financial
issues that you have?

806
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,990
Could be something's wrong with your
house and you have to pay to get it fixed.

807
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:33,830
And all these things just constantly
chip away at your ability to focus on the

808
00:25:33,831 --> 00:25:35,810
now and to enjoy,

809
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,380
uh,

810
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,690
just to enjoy the
experience of life itself.

811
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,260
Yeah.

812
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:43,820
I've never really felt comfortable kind
of meditating to try to let all those

813
00:25:43,821 --> 00:25:48,290
things go because I get into this state
where I have this idea of something

814
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:48,830
should I do,

815
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:49,401
I should do.

816
00:25:49,401 --> 00:25:51,770
And I think those things that you
mentioned are really important.

817
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,240
How you relate to your friends.

818
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:54,020
Those are words,

819
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,640
those are the most
important things of life.

820
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:56,960
Not that at least important,

821
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:59,120
but I've always felt like when I'm,

822
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,740
if I were to be meditating,

823
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:03,590
this idea will come up and I'm
supposed to just let it go.

824
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,341
And I thought,

825
00:26:04,341 --> 00:26:05,330
why don't I just do it?

826
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,780
I'm more outer focused in,

827
00:26:08,781 --> 00:26:09,614
for me,

828
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,573
the,

829
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,390
uh,

830
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:14,660
jogging and being stoned
are like meditation.

831
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,081
Oh,

832
00:26:15,081 --> 00:26:16,490
it's definitely the meditation.

833
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,270
Yeah.

834
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:17,451
Yeah.

835
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:19,850
Jogging stone is a trip.

836
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,590
It's very different than,

837
00:26:21,591 --> 00:26:22,850
than just exercising.

838
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,793
Yeah.

839
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:24,420
Fight.

840
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:24,820
I have,

841
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:28,430
but I think that this idea of creating
a space like in the tank or like a

842
00:26:28,431 --> 00:26:31,910
therapeutic setting where you're not
paying attention to all those daily things

843
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:34,130
where you can sink deeper to,

844
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,493
um,

845
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,210
other questions of life that
that is really important.

846
00:26:38,211 --> 00:26:40,790
You have to kind of consciously
create a space for that.

847
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:41,683
Yeah.

848
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,090
The,

849
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:44,550
the things that always up in trips,

850
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,120
um,

851
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,450
for me that they're,

852
00:26:46,451 --> 00:26:46,591
the,

853
00:26:46,591 --> 00:26:50,610
the uncomfortable things are always
things that I really should be working on

854
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:51,300
anyway.

855
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,470
It's always like,

856
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:56,310
maybe I've hit an imbalance and I focus
too much on this and not enough on that

857
00:26:56,311 --> 00:26:56,441
or,

858
00:26:56,441 --> 00:26:57,420
or whatever it is.

859
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,200
Those,

860
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,300
those moments where it hits you,

861
00:27:00,301 --> 00:27:01,860
it's like you should've known that anyway.

862
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,230
And if you,

863
00:27:03,231 --> 00:27:03,781
if you knew,

864
00:27:03,781 --> 00:27:05,880
if you were living in a harmonious way,

865
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:06,990
we wouldn't have to tell you this.

866
00:27:06,991 --> 00:27:07,291
All right,

867
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:08,160
so get it over with.

868
00:27:08,161 --> 00:27:08,994
Figure that out.

869
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,050
And every trip that I've had that,

870
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:11,460
that,

871
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,450
where that's happened,

872
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,670
they've only been a few of
them that are really liberal,

873
00:27:14,671 --> 00:27:15,990
like super uncomfortable,

874
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:16,980
just really bad.

875
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:17,971
But those always,

876
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:19,320
I benefited from those,

877
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,371
every one of them.

878
00:27:20,371 --> 00:27:20,521
Now?

879
00:27:20,521 --> 00:27:21,540
What do you mean by bad?

880
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,890
I don't mean bad.

881
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:23,310
Uh,

882
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,090
I mean,

883
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:24,600
um,

884
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,780
uncomfortable like
especially with the eating,

885
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:28,710
eating marijuana,

886
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,360
the eating marijuana thing.

887
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,140
Yeah.

888
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:35,940
A lot of folks do not give that the proper
respect and that's why they freak out

889
00:27:35,941 --> 00:27:36,774
and call the cops.

890
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,340
If I'm sure you heard the great video of
the police officers who stole marijuana

891
00:27:41,341 --> 00:27:46,200
from someone they pulled over and then
made pot brownies and then got so high

892
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:48,210
they panicked and called the police.

893
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:49,590
They call the ambulance,

894
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,180
call the ambulance.

895
00:27:51,181 --> 00:27:52,190
He was saying right there.

896
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:53,550
Have you heard that before,

897
00:27:53,551 --> 00:27:54,000
Brian?

898
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,121
Yeah,

899
00:27:54,121 --> 00:27:54,954
we played it on here.

900
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,030
That's right.

901
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:56,730
He played it.

902
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:57,151
Oh sure.

903
00:27:57,151 --> 00:27:58,530
Play it just for the goof.

904
00:27:58,531 --> 00:27:59,760
Cause it's fucking ridiculous.

905
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,050
These poor people,

906
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:02,190
but they didn't know these,

907
00:28:02,191 --> 00:28:06,300
these dirty cops is that marijuana
and when it's processed by your liver,

908
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:07,021
when you eat it,

909
00:28:07,021 --> 00:28:11,490
it's produces something called 11 hydroxy
metabolite and incredibly psychoactive

910
00:28:11,491 --> 00:28:11,851
material.

911
00:28:11,851 --> 00:28:14,430
It's not like the THC high at all.

912
00:28:14,431 --> 00:28:16,890
It's a totally different
experience in much stronger.

913
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,620
And that's why a lot of people
think that like the aide cookie,

914
00:28:19,621 --> 00:28:20,970
that it was laced like,

915
00:28:20,971 --> 00:28:21,361
oh my God.

916
00:28:21,361 --> 00:28:22,740
So when he lays this was something,

917
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,010
I know you're taking a
totally different drug.

918
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:26,711
Yeah.

919
00:28:26,711 --> 00:28:30,100
We do harm reduction
at festivals to try to,

920
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:30,850
uh,

921
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,470
imagine a post prohibition world.

922
00:28:32,471 --> 00:28:34,270
So at burning man,

923
00:28:34,271 --> 00:28:35,104
boom,

924
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,750
other festivals where we provide,

925
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,170
um,

926
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:41,380
an organized teams of therapists and
others that work with people that have

927
00:28:41,381 --> 00:28:45,100
difficult trips and people at the most
people come sometimes is for eating too

928
00:28:45,101 --> 00:28:45,850
much marijuana.

929
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:46,151
Yeah.

930
00:28:46,151 --> 00:28:48,180
People don't realize how this,

931
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:52,510
this easily can be as strong
as any psychedelic g tech
and that's not bullshit.

932
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,800
And listen to these poor folks

933
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,330
calling nine one one call.

934
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:56,111
You will hear,

935
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:58,210
tell him where the
information had been removed.

936
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,213
Boy,

937
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:00,893
Michael.

938
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:03,363
Yeah.

939
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,040
Can you please send rescue?

940
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:11,460
I think I'm having an
overdose and so is my wife.

941
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,160
Okay.

942
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:12,993
You and your wife?

943
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,083
Yeah.

944
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,660
Overdose of what?

945
00:29:15,661 --> 00:29:16,494
Marijuana.

946
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,060
I don't know if they had something in it.

947
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,070
Oh,

948
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:19,903
okay.

949
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
The police and rescue.

950
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:21,301
Okay.

951
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,170
How old are you?

952
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,220
I'm 28.

953
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,330
29 years old.

954
00:29:24,331 --> 00:29:25,890
And my wife is,

955
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:26,840
uh,

956
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,390
25th.

957
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,950
Please calm 20 sec.

958
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,310
Yes,

959
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:29,850
please.

960
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:30,091
Hey,

961
00:29:30,091 --> 00:29:31,320
I think paint also.

962
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,740
What have you guys been
drinking tonight too?

963
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:34,561
No,

964
00:29:34,561 --> 00:29:35,394
that's it.

965
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:37,740
Is there any weapons in your house?

966
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,520
No.

967
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,330
Please come.

968
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:40,163
Okay.

969
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,750
Are you guys like you guys have fever?

970
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:44,781
No,

971
00:29:44,781 --> 00:29:45,610
I'm just,

972
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:46,600
I think we're dying.

973
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:47,640
Oh,

974
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,210
how much did you guys have?

975
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:49,710
A,

976
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:50,290
I dunno.

977
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:52,450
We made brownies and I take what dad?

978
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:53,463
I really do.

979
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:54,021
Okay.

980
00:29:54,021 --> 00:29:54,280
At.

981
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:54,431
Well,

982
00:29:54,431 --> 00:29:55,900
how much should you put your mounties?

983
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:56,961
I don't know.

984
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:57,200
I,

985
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,460
I hit him back.

986
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:01,150
Um,

987
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:03,260
my wife and I did too,

988
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,110
but come here.

989
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:04,943
Okay.

990
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:06,890
She's on,

991
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,170
she's on the living room ground,

992
00:30:08,171 --> 00:30:08,291
right?

993
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:09,124
Yeah.

994
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,070
Barely breathing.

995
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,310
I think so.

996
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:15,323
Okay.

997
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,033
Pardon?

998
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:18,660
Did I?

999
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:18,931
Yeah,

1000
00:30:18,931 --> 00:30:19,411
I could feel it.

1001
00:30:19,411 --> 00:30:20,760
She's laying right down in front of me.

1002
00:30:20,761 --> 00:30:21,900
Time is going by really,

1003
00:30:21,901 --> 00:30:22,261
really,

1004
00:30:22,261 --> 00:30:22,591
really,

1005
00:30:22,591 --> 00:30:23,424
really slow.

1006
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:30,100
Pardon?

1007
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:30,320
Yeah.

1008
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,153
How much did you buy

1009
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:32,960
this?

1010
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,940
Please send rescue.

1011
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:39,440
It's probably like a quarter ounce total.

1012
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,031
Yeah,

1013
00:30:44,031 --> 00:30:44,864
we did.

1014
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:49,003
Okay.

1015
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:53,990
Why is that funny?

1016
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:54,471
I'll tell you why.

1017
00:30:54,471 --> 00:30:55,970
It's funny cause he can't die from it.

1018
00:30:56,810 --> 00:31:00,560
The only way pots going to kill you is
if you take 25 pounds and he dropped it

1019
00:31:00,561 --> 00:31:03,020
off of a CIA drug plain
and it lands in your head.

1020
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,310
That's how pots going to kill you.

1021
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,870
You could probably get a heart attack.

1022
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:10,850
A good movie could kill
you if that's the case.

1023
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,610
You Pussy.

1024
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:12,180
Yeah.

1025
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:17,180
The other question is why did they
think they would die and it's not just

1026
00:31:17,361 --> 00:31:22,100
because their heart was racing or things
like that that the judgment day it's,

1027
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:26,750
well it's like these feel during parts
of the brain that the pie when you eat it

1028
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:27,231
like that,

1029
00:31:27,231 --> 00:31:28,460
it's kind of very powerful.

1030
00:31:28,461 --> 00:31:31,700
It is like tripping code and
so your sense of who you are.

1031
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:32,900
He was pretty logical.

1032
00:31:32,901 --> 00:31:34,700
He was pretty good at
answering the questions.

1033
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,290
He had some problems.

1034
00:31:36,291 --> 00:31:37,124
So some of that,

1035
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:42,730
but I think people confuse ego
death with physical death and ego,

1036
00:31:42,861 --> 00:31:46,880
death of letting go of who your narrow
sense of who you are and opening up into

1037
00:31:46,881 --> 00:31:47,900
something very scary.

1038
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:52,220
And so people have defenses
and they converted into,

1039
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,880
I think I'm dying because
it feels like that you,

1040
00:31:55,881 --> 00:31:57,440
that you is dying in a way.

1041
00:31:57,770 --> 00:31:58,401
That's interesting.

1042
00:31:58,401 --> 00:31:58,701
But I mean,

1043
00:31:58,701 --> 00:32:02,600
don't you think also he's just fucking
panicking and thinking that he overdosed

1044
00:32:02,601 --> 00:32:04,760
on a drug and just shitting his pants?

1045
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,620
I can maybe not even an ego death.

1046
00:32:06,621 --> 00:32:10,790
Just absolute fear of the fact that you
don't know what the hell was in there

1047
00:32:10,791 --> 00:32:10,931
and you,

1048
00:32:10,931 --> 00:32:11,120
well,

1049
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,200
he knows he made it.

1050
00:32:12,201 --> 00:32:12,741
It was pot.

1051
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:13,580
He knew what it was.

1052
00:32:13,581 --> 00:32:16,290
He just got taken by
surprise how strong it was.

1053
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,560
But he said he doesn't know
if there's anything in it.

1054
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,190
Well,

1055
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:20,360
it's what you said right before,

1056
00:32:20,361 --> 00:32:23,030
as people start thinking it was
laced with something that it's not.

1057
00:32:23,031 --> 00:32:23,481
So,

1058
00:32:23,481 --> 00:32:23,841
I mean,

1059
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:25,310
I think the guy thought he was dying.

1060
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,193
Well,

1061
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:29,500
I thought I was dying on
weed before I caught it.

1062
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,230
Really physically if that you're dying.

1063
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:32,480
Yeah,

1064
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,970
it'd be because I had
something in my life,

1065
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,040
I always thought it had
something wrong with my heart,

1066
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:37,431
you know,

1067
00:32:37,431 --> 00:32:37,890
so I had,

1068
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:38,390
uh,

1069
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,100
like as a kid would pass out

1070
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,140
and black out and just
like fall to the ground.

1071
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,630
I had to take the stress test
as like an eight year old kid.

1072
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:44,840
Like,

1073
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,051
you know,

1074
00:32:45,051 --> 00:32:45,830
taking,

1075
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,240
running on the treadmill and stuff.

1076
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:47,840
No,

1077
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,190
they could never find out what happened,

1078
00:32:49,191 --> 00:32:49,431
you know,

1079
00:32:49,431 --> 00:32:51,680
then it would happen again
like four years later.

1080
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:52,730
So like growing up,

1081
00:32:52,731 --> 00:32:53,930
I always had this thing like,

1082
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:54,231
all right,

1083
00:32:54,231 --> 00:32:55,670
I have a bad Boone heart type shit.

1084
00:32:55,671 --> 00:32:56,071
Like it's,

1085
00:32:56,071 --> 00:32:59,480
it's like it's a broken heart or there's
something with a valve that they just

1086
00:32:59,481 --> 00:33:00,380
haven't detected.

1087
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,390
And so when I smoked too much weed,

1088
00:33:02,391 --> 00:33:04,520
I immediately thought I
felt my heart and I'm like,

1089
00:33:04,521 --> 00:33:04,791
all right,

1090
00:33:04,791 --> 00:33:06,260
my heart is fucked up.

1091
00:33:06,261 --> 00:33:07,550
So I,

1092
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:09,170
it wasn't that the weed was killing me,

1093
00:33:09,171 --> 00:33:12,770
but it might be doing something to what
I already thought I had a problem with

1094
00:33:12,771 --> 00:33:13,491
my heart already,

1095
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:13,731
you know,

1096
00:33:13,731 --> 00:33:14,564
type thing.

1097
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,590
In other words,

1098
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,510
you were panicking like a little bitch.

1099
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:17,881
Yeah.

1100
00:33:17,881 --> 00:33:19,040
When you thought you were going to die.

1101
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:20,560
When you hear,

1102
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,500
when you feel your heart double beat,

1103
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,730
you know when it just like bup up,

1104
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:24,931
up,

1105
00:33:24,931 --> 00:33:25,061
up,

1106
00:33:25,061 --> 00:33:25,340
up,

1107
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:25,570
pump,

1108
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,690
you know that starts doing shit like that.

1109
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,540
You certainly mind fuck yourself.

1110
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,010
Yeah.

1111
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:30,843
You know,

1112
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,060
I didn't know you had that thing though.

1113
00:33:32,061 --> 00:33:33,680
I didn't know that you blacked out.

1114
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:36,260
I blacked out five times in my life.

1115
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,040
Wow.

1116
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:37,340
You know,

1117
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,240
and they've tried everything.

1118
00:33:38,241 --> 00:33:39,920
They've done tons of tests.

1119
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:40,610
You know,

1120
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:43,910
it's only been like the
last maybe five years.

1121
00:33:43,911 --> 00:33:45,650
I just don't give a
shit about that anymore.

1122
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:45,930
You know?

1123
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:49,430
I don't know what happens and I don't
ever get panic attacks anymore anxiety

1124
00:33:49,431 --> 00:33:49,791
anymore.

1125
00:33:49,791 --> 00:33:50,870
It just went away.

1126
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:52,490
I mean I've been using a lot Molly lately,

1127
00:33:52,491 --> 00:33:53,324
so maybe that's why

1128
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:55,240
you,

1129
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,530
you probably look good
evidence for my therapy.

1130
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,960
I believe in that a million
times over storms or anything,

1131
00:34:02,961 --> 00:34:06,650
especially when you're with a loved one
and there's definitely something minute.

1132
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,240
I don't think over,

1133
00:34:08,241 --> 00:34:10,010
I don't think it's a
competition or a race.

1134
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:12,410
I think they all have
their own little impact.

1135
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:15,140
We're talking about psychedelic medicine,

1136
00:34:15,141 --> 00:34:16,250
psychedelic spirituality,

1137
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:19,720
and it's the whole range of drugs at
different times at different places.

1138
00:34:19,721 --> 00:34:20,110
But yeah,

1139
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:20,943
we did it.

1140
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,440
The other thing about
psychedelics is it can,

1141
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:27,670
there's a lot of states that can be
achieved naturally and I think in the

1142
00:34:27,671 --> 00:34:31,480
pursuit of a psychedelics as a discipline,

1143
00:34:31,481 --> 00:34:31,811
as,

1144
00:34:31,811 --> 00:34:34,600
as something just to
truly legitimately study.

1145
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,470
I think one of the things that they're
going to open up is what yoga does to the

1146
00:34:38,471 --> 00:34:39,304
body.

1147
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:40,240
Yeah.

1148
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,380
Yoga does something,

1149
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,590
they're intense.

1150
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:45,120
Come on Brian Class,

1151
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:47,030
stop it.

1152
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:47,580
Get it,

1153
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:47,890
get.

1154
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:48,521
If you,

1155
00:34:48,521 --> 00:34:51,790
if you take a really strong yoga
class and you get through it,

1156
00:34:51,791 --> 00:34:52,660
you feel like your high

1157
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:53,490
yeah.

1158
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:54,000
Yeah.

1159
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,833
And I,

1160
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,640
I am aware of friends,

1161
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:59,150
longterm yoga practitioners,

1162
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:04,160
long term meditators who have found
that it's not either or that you can,

1163
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,900
when you're practiced in these ways too,

1164
00:35:06,901 --> 00:35:08,730
that you can have a
psychedelic experience.

1165
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:11,070
You can go to a deeper
place and then you can work,

1166
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:14,310
you have a better sense of where you
want to be and you can work sometimes for

1167
00:35:14,311 --> 00:35:16,830
years to grounded and integrated.

1168
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:17,940
And it's,

1169
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,890
it's this flow back and forth.

1170
00:35:19,891 --> 00:35:24,750
So I think the overreliance
on psychedelics can prove
to be harmful because

1171
00:35:24,751 --> 00:35:27,870
you're not doing the
integration or with John Lilly,

1172
00:35:27,871 --> 00:35:28,920
you're escaping,

1173
00:35:28,921 --> 00:35:32,700
but the idea that you'll
stay somehow or other,

1174
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:33,660
you know,

1175
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,460
pure and do things all on your own,

1176
00:35:35,461 --> 00:35:36,570
there's a certain kind of,

1177
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:37,860
um,

1178
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:40,710
slowness or egotism about that.

1179
00:35:40,711 --> 00:35:40,851
It's,

1180
00:35:40,851 --> 00:35:41,684
it's not,

1181
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:42,190
uh,

1182
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:46,020
inappropriate to admit sometimes
that we need physical catalysts.

1183
00:35:46,021 --> 00:35:46,770
We need help.

1184
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:47,700
We need tools.

1185
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:49,530
Sometimes our defenses are so strong.

1186
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,010
No,

1187
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:51,780
I don't think it's an either or situation.

1188
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:54,050
I don't think there's anything we,

1189
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:54,961
for whatever reason,

1190
00:35:54,961 --> 00:35:57,930
we have this idea in our head that
taking something to get somewhere as a

1191
00:35:57,931 --> 00:35:58,764
weakness.

1192
00:35:58,890 --> 00:35:59,131
You know,

1193
00:35:59,131 --> 00:36:00,670
there's a lot of people that believe that,

1194
00:36:00,671 --> 00:36:03,750
that taking a drug to
achieve a state like,

1195
00:36:03,751 --> 00:36:04,051
oh,

1196
00:36:04,051 --> 00:36:05,310
you can't deal with reality.

1197
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,290
You're weak,

1198
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:06,670
you know?

1199
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:06,840
Yup.

1200
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,673
There is that.

1201
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,330
But then you switch it to cars.

1202
00:36:09,331 --> 00:36:13,440
Like you'd take a car to get psych
suck a plane and a car to get here.

1203
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:14,780
Yeah.

1204
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:14,931
No,

1205
00:36:14,931 --> 00:36:16,280
you could definitely look at it that way.

1206
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:18,140
I just think the,

1207
00:36:18,141 --> 00:36:21,710
the idea is very strange
when we know that,

1208
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:22,550
look,

1209
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:22,860
our,

1210
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:23,330
our,

1211
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:28,330
our bodies are these weird biological
machines that were constantly feeding

1212
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,720
different things too.

1213
00:36:29,721 --> 00:36:32,510
We're constantly giving a
different kinds of nutrients.

1214
00:36:32,511 --> 00:36:34,850
We experiment with the diets,

1215
00:36:34,851 --> 00:36:37,880
we experiment in our carbohydrate
balance and our protein,

1216
00:36:37,881 --> 00:36:39,380
but we experiment with all
these different things.

1217
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,720
But when it comes to taking a plant,

1218
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,620
especially something like mushrooms sets,

1219
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:48,800
we've documented many thousands of years
of use and to decide all of a sudden

1220
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,040
that this is a weakness and that this is,

1221
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:52,581
you know,

1222
00:36:52,581 --> 00:36:57,581
just unnecessary in society as if
our society is perfect in every way.

1223
00:36:57,651 --> 00:36:58,550
And you know,

1224
00:36:58,830 --> 00:36:59,121
yeah,

1225
00:36:59,121 --> 00:37:01,400
no need for self examination here at all.

1226
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:01,691
Yeah,

1227
00:37:01,691 --> 00:37:06,280
well we're actually an anomaly as far
as society goes cause most of them have,

1228
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:07,300
uh,

1229
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,430
the use of drugs,

1230
00:37:09,431 --> 00:37:14,020
the use of altered states in
some kind of sanctioned manner.

1231
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:18,550
It's repressed and prohibited
throughout our lifetimes.

1232
00:37:18,551 --> 00:37:22,510
We kind of have a sense that maybe that's
the way it's been large parts of human

1233
00:37:22,511 --> 00:37:22,841
history,

1234
00:37:22,841 --> 00:37:24,040
but it's not been that way.

1235
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:29,350
They're encased in a religious rituals
or different kind of cultural context.

1236
00:37:29,351 --> 00:37:31,750
But they're not prohibited
and they're respected.

1237
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,870
And I think that's where
we've lost touch with that.

1238
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:39,900
And there's so much coming from people
finding it on their own through various

1239
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:43,240
methods that the culture is changing.

1240
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,020
I think it's definitely changing.

1241
00:37:45,021 --> 00:37:50,021
And I think what's really crazy is
that the people who are suppressing

1242
00:37:51,831 --> 00:37:52,551
psychedelics,

1243
00:37:52,551 --> 00:37:55,880
that people who seek to suppressant are
the ones need them more than anybody.

1244
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:56,801
Well exactly.

1245
00:37:56,801 --> 00:37:58,630
So our study right now that we're doing,

1246
00:37:58,631 --> 00:38:02,020
and again the with Mtma for
posttraumatic stress disorder,

1247
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:03,250
I owe it to the point to Brian,

1248
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,540
you're the poster boy kid revelations,

1249
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,360
just the first one for tonight.

1250
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:11,320
Um,

1251
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:16,320
so we're working with veterans and then
we've also expanded it now to work with

1252
00:38:18,101 --> 00:38:20,710
firefighters and also
with police officers.

1253
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:25,870
And I had pretty much given up hope about
getting a police officer actually to

1254
00:38:25,871 --> 00:38:26,710
volunteer.

1255
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:31,510
So we've had 15 people out of 24
the 15th is going through screening.

1256
00:38:31,511 --> 00:38:36,511
The first 11 we're 11 of them were vets
and were firefighters and now we have

1257
00:38:37,871 --> 00:38:40,660
the first police officer that
is going through screening.

1258
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:46,050
So the people that are repressing it in
some ways they do need it the most and

1259
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:49,420
how to help them relax about it,

1260
00:38:49,421 --> 00:38:52,810
at least to let others
or to explore themselves.

1261
00:38:52,811 --> 00:38:56,230
But at the same time I've been trying
to get my father and mother to smoke pot

1262
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:59,950
since I was 20 years old and
they've never once done it,

1263
00:38:59,951 --> 00:39:01,720
but they're totally
supportive of what I do.

1264
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,160
They think it's a tremendous,

1265
00:39:03,161 --> 00:39:04,180
but they will not.

1266
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,490
There was one time when my mother had um,

1267
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:07,790
uh,

1268
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:08,500
uh,

1269
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,160
some pain.

1270
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,520
She had fallen down in,

1271
00:39:10,521 --> 00:39:11,051
in her leg,

1272
00:39:11,051 --> 00:39:15,340
was really in pain and she said she would
try marijuana for pain and I got home

1273
00:39:15,341 --> 00:39:19,720
like a week later because
she's in a different city
and she said then she wasn't

1274
00:39:19,721 --> 00:39:20,800
in enough pain anymore.

1275
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,100
Oh Wow.

1276
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:24,770
I was too slow for a mom.

1277
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:25,921
Well,

1278
00:39:25,921 --> 00:39:26,270
you know,

1279
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:30,930
there's a lot of folks that are a
prisoner to that propaganda that was just

1280
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:33,380
really shot home from the 30s on.

1281
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:33,781
It's,

1282
00:39:33,781 --> 00:39:34,040
yeah,

1283
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:39,040
it's a pretty incredible feat when you
stop and think about the effectiveness of

1284
00:39:39,531 --> 00:39:44,531
marijuana and not just for people like
as far as like a a drug and not just for

1285
00:39:45,771 --> 00:39:46,970
its psychoactive properties,

1286
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:48,950
but just the plant hemp itself.

1287
00:39:48,951 --> 00:39:52,520
Just all the amazing benefits
it has for as far as nutrition,

1288
00:39:52,521 --> 00:39:53,720
construction methods,

1289
00:39:53,721 --> 00:39:55,700
making paper and clothes and
all these different things.

1290
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:59,780
The fact that somehow none of that kept
that from the public and kept it under

1291
00:39:59,781 --> 00:40:03,410
wraps and kept the from really
from the average person's database.

1292
00:40:03,411 --> 00:40:03,880
Most people,

1293
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:07,310
if you ask him about
marijuana being illegal,

1294
00:40:07,311 --> 00:40:08,090
what about hemp?

1295
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:08,421
Oh,

1296
00:40:08,421 --> 00:40:09,650
it's isn't the same thing.

1297
00:40:09,651 --> 00:40:10,484
Like what does that mean?

1298
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,820
People don't even know
what the fuck can't,

1299
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:12,743
is

1300
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:13,171
the,

1301
00:40:13,171 --> 00:40:18,060
what they should know is that the largest
hemp importing country in the world is

1302
00:40:18,061 --> 00:40:23,061
the United States and the largest hemp x
sporting country in the world is China.

1303
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:25,320
So why is that?

1304
00:40:25,321 --> 00:40:27,210
Why we've kept it narrow legal.

1305
00:40:27,211 --> 00:40:28,130
We're inputting it,

1306
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:29,580
but relating other people grow it.

1307
00:40:29,581 --> 00:40:30,414
It's incredible.

1308
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:31,100
But that's,

1309
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,820
that's all the largest producer of,

1310
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:33,780
of,

1311
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:36,170
of pharmaceutical drugs is United States.

1312
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:36,980
That's why,

1313
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,380
and that's really what it boils down to.

1314
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:42,710
The pharmaceutical drugs without a doubt
don't want marijuana to become legal.

1315
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,610
And one of the doorways from
marijuana to become legal is him.

1316
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:46,161
His people.

1317
00:40:46,161 --> 00:40:51,161
Figuring out how incredibly effective
hemp is for so many things that we use

1318
00:40:51,681 --> 00:40:54,470
other stuff for besides the
psychoactive properties.

1319
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,890
Just it's a makes it
fantastic protein powder.

1320
00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:58,590
My,

1321
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,680
the company that I'm involved with on it,

1322
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,510
my friend Aubrey and I,

1323
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:03,050
we,

1324
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:05,900
when we was first you met
Aubrey up in San Francisco,

1325
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:08,470
when we first started
talking about a Hamp,

1326
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:08,840
we,

1327
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,261
we thought,

1328
00:41:09,261 --> 00:41:12,650
well maybe we could get a farm
in this country and you know,

1329
00:41:12,651 --> 00:41:17,000
grow this hemp hemp seed and then use
it for the protein powder completely.

1330
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,880
Non-Psychoactive when we found
out you can't even do that.

1331
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,680
Like even though hemp is legal,

1332
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:22,880
I didn't know that.

1333
00:41:22,881 --> 00:41:25,070
They literally can't be
grown in the United States.

1334
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,780
We buy it all from Canada.

1335
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:27,560
Yeah.

1336
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,393
One of the,

1337
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:29,283
um,

1338
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:31,970
people on maps as board of
directors is David Bronner.

1339
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:33,800
And so from Bronner soaps,

1340
00:41:33,801 --> 00:41:38,240
his grandfather started and he's been
very active in that hemp hemp oil soap.

1341
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:43,540
They use hemp oil and writing like a
crazy person documentary on Netflix about

1342
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:43,930
him.

1343
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:44,310
Yeah.

1344
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:44,810
Oh really?

1345
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:45,643
What's it called?

1346
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,180
I think it's called Doctor Bronner's.

1347
00:41:47,181 --> 00:41:48,050
Magic soap.

1348
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:48,950
I have a friend,

1349
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:49,970
so I'll use 80 bravo.

1350
00:41:49,971 --> 00:41:50,850
That's all he uses forever.

1351
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:51,350
Well,

1352
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:54,320
David and his brother Mike
have built this business from,

1353
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:56,630
their father was kind of obsessed.

1354
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,940
They are their grandfather
and they knew that.

1355
00:41:58,941 --> 00:42:03,230
So they took this business over when it
was really fragmented and like a million

1356
00:42:03,231 --> 00:42:05,900
or two a year in sales and they've
built it up to over 50 million,

1357
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:06,980
50 million.

1358
00:42:06,981 --> 00:42:11,150
And they in sales not just hope at
other products and they don't advertise,

1359
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:12,440
they don't advertise.

1360
00:42:12,441 --> 00:42:15,370
What they do is they
do now Bronner's soap,

1361
00:42:15,371 --> 00:42:15,740
kill it,

1362
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:16,520
go get it.

1363
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:16,880
Well,

1364
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,750
here's your local.

1365
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:20,990
What they do is a social
justice illegally activism.

1366
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:21,853
They do,

1367
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:22,550
um,

1368
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:24,770
they focus on fair trade and other things.

1369
00:42:24,771 --> 00:42:29,771
But what David did about four months ago
or five months ago is he constructed a

1370
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:30,680
cage,

1371
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,730
a metal cage,

1372
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:37,150
and he had someone drop it off with him
inside it in front of the White House

1373
00:42:38,811 --> 00:42:39,890
right across the street.

1374
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:42,410
And he was processing hemp plants.

1375
00:42:42,411 --> 00:42:44,600
He had gotten real hemp seeds.

1376
00:42:44,601 --> 00:42:49,280
He had grown it in the United States
and he was processing it into hemp oil.

1377
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:51,710
And he did this as a protest.

1378
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:56,150
And the cage was to prevent the police
to slow them down while they tried to

1379
00:42:56,151 --> 00:42:57,260
stop them from doing it.

1380
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:00,740
And he actually got convicted
and it had to do public service.

1381
00:43:00,741 --> 00:43:02,840
But what he was trying
to show is that hemp,

1382
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:04,310
which can be a food,

1383
00:43:04,311 --> 00:43:08,870
which can be any number of different
things and can be grown in the United

1384
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:09,170
States,

1385
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:09,890
was a crime.

1386
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:10,340
That,

1387
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:14,870
and just making it into hemp oil to put
on his bread was enough to put him in

1388
00:43:14,871 --> 00:43:15,830
jail and to give them,

1389
00:43:15,831 --> 00:43:16,664
uh,

1390
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:17,240
uh,

1391
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,073
penalties.

1392
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,830
It doesn't make any sense and it's
insane that it continues to go on.

1393
00:43:21,831 --> 00:43:26,831
It's one of those weird aspects of our
society where you look at it and you go,

1394
00:43:27,321 --> 00:43:27,591
well,

1395
00:43:27,591 --> 00:43:28,820
there's gotta be a reason.

1396
00:43:28,821 --> 00:43:29,001
Let's,

1397
00:43:29,001 --> 00:43:30,260
so let's search for a reason.

1398
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:33,170
And you look for a reason and
it literally doesn't exist.

1399
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:37,820
I think there are real strong reasons
that go really deep that make us easy to

1400
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:38,450
miss them.

1401
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:42,650
But I think they're the natural fear
that each of us has for when our social

1402
00:43:42,651 --> 00:43:44,090
controls are relaxed,

1403
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:47,570
that will become a
whatever we will become.

1404
00:43:47,571 --> 00:43:49,370
It's what you talked
about even in the tent,

1405
00:43:49,371 --> 00:43:51,560
when the t the flotation tank,

1406
00:43:51,561 --> 00:43:52,550
when things come up,

1407
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:53,361
you know,

1408
00:43:53,361 --> 00:43:57,020
it's just people are scared
of the compromises that
they've had to make to live

1409
00:43:57,021 --> 00:44:01,250
in society and have their basic urges
and what happens when they're not in

1410
00:44:01,251 --> 00:44:02,084
control.

1411
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:03,770
And that's what these drugs represent.

1412
00:44:03,771 --> 00:44:08,771
And the 60s also represented not only
these people that let themselves get out

1413
00:44:08,841 --> 00:44:09,321
of control,

1414
00:44:09,321 --> 00:44:12,680
then they want to leave and drop out
and then they want to change things.

1415
00:44:12,681 --> 00:44:12,871
And it,

1416
00:44:12,871 --> 00:44:15,170
it was a difficult,

1417
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:17,030
people are scared of their own.

1418
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:20,460
I feel it in myself that
I'm scared sometimes of,

1419
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:21,913
uh,

1420
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:22,670
you know,

1421
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:24,680
my deep desires or you know,

1422
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:25,623
oh,

1423
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:27,800
that you just created a meme,

1424
00:44:27,801 --> 00:44:28,634
sir,

1425
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:28,970
too.

1426
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:29,803
Right?

1427
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:32,190
I feel like I'm scared of my deep desire.

1428
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:36,240
I didn't need to see here's some
1970s music playing over that.

1429
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:37,243
Yeah.

1430
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:38,750
So I think that's a big part.

1431
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:39,351
Speaking of that,

1432
00:44:39,351 --> 00:44:40,760
Jim Kelly died today,

1433
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:41,210
man.

1434
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:42,500
The great karate master,

1435
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,070
Jan,

1436
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:44,270
Jamie clued me on that.

1437
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,960
A dude from enter the
dragon breast of pieced.

1438
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:48,883
Mr. Kelly.

1439
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,090
Sorry.

1440
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:50,370
Yes,

1441
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:50,600
no,

1442
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:51,250
no.

1443
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:53,780
That's important to think
about how short our time is.

1444
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:54,411
It is,

1445
00:44:54,411 --> 00:44:54,920
right.

1446
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:55,753
It really is.

1447
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,110
That's why we got to get all these anti,

1448
00:44:57,111 --> 00:45:02,111
we'd people high or at least
help them see more human rights,

1449
00:45:02,541 --> 00:45:03,201
more freedom.

1450
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:04,790
Why should they tell us what to do?

1451
00:45:04,791 --> 00:45:09,290
And I think the other part of it is that
the drug laws have been used for social

1452
00:45:09,291 --> 00:45:14,291
repression against minorities and
either Mexicans or blacks or you know,

1453
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:19,970
hippies and that letting loose
of that avenue of control.

1454
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:21,290
There's in the power system.

1455
00:45:21,291 --> 00:45:24,230
And I think what we're needing
to do to integrate these things,

1456
00:45:24,231 --> 00:45:25,490
to legalize marijuana,

1457
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:26,840
to legalize gay marriage,

1458
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:29,770
these kinds of things where people see
it's not going to tear apart the fabrics

1459
00:45:29,771 --> 00:45:30,604
of society,

1460
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:34,640
that people can make contributions and
that people can also learn to deal with

1461
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:37,940
their deep desire so that
they're not so scared of him.

1462
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:38,411
Yeah.

1463
00:45:38,411 --> 00:45:41,950
We've made some massive headway
as a culture because of that.

1464
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:42,610
Um,

1465
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:42,851
the,

1466
00:45:42,851 --> 00:45:43,990
the gay marriage thing,

1467
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:47,740
the fact that I'm Idaho
got it before California,

1468
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:48,850
that that hurt,

1469
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:50,463
that really hurt.

1470
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:51,161
There was like,

1471
00:45:51,161 --> 00:45:52,460
how's how dumb you fucks.

1472
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:53,731
And the,

1473
00:45:53,731 --> 00:45:53,991
the,

1474
00:45:53,991 --> 00:45:54,280
the,

1475
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:59,280
the name of the bill that eliminated the
ability for gay people to get married,

1476
00:45:59,531 --> 00:46:00,180
the marriage,

1477
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:01,130
but it was it fencing,

1478
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:02,560
defensive marriage act.

1479
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:03,670
Oh God.

1480
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:07,600
How about if you really
want to defend marriage?

1481
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:08,201
I'll be stopped.

1482
00:46:08,201 --> 00:46:09,370
People from getting divorced.

1483
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:10,790
See how that works out.

1484
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:12,580
You really want to defend marriage.

1485
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:14,060
Tell people they have to say together.

1486
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:16,390
That should be a t shirt
right there for real.

1487
00:46:16,391 --> 00:46:17,620
You want to defend marriage.

1488
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:19,120
Marriage is ridiculous.

1489
00:46:19,121 --> 00:46:20,740
This is coming from a
person who's married.

1490
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:22,660
It's a stupid idea.

1491
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:27,160
It's a legal contract that you signed
with another human being and then you're

1492
00:46:27,161 --> 00:46:30,730
going to bring in a bunch of other people
if it doesn't work out and they get to

1493
00:46:30,731 --> 00:46:33,550
dictate where your
money and property goes,

1494
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:34,413
so why don't you do it?

1495
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,313
Because I love her.

1496
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:38,410
She's an awesome person and it makes
her feel better and I don't give a shit.

1497
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:40,870
We have children together
and I'm not going anywhere.

1498
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:43,510
So I actually love being married to her.

1499
00:46:43,511 --> 00:46:45,030
I love her as a human being.

1500
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,330
She's a great person,

1501
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:50,620
but the whole involving the
legal system part of it,

1502
00:46:50,621 --> 00:46:51,790
it's so dumb.

1503
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:54,280
It's just so ridiculously dumb.

1504
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,050
It doesn't make any sense to me.

1505
00:46:56,290 --> 00:46:56,950
And I,

1506
00:46:56,950 --> 00:47:01,950
I understand completely the need for
child support and for some folks needed to

1507
00:47:02,921 --> 00:47:07,060
be written in stone what they have
to pay and things along those lines.

1508
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:07,961
But you know,

1509
00:47:07,961 --> 00:47:09,460
I'm not that person and I,

1510
00:47:09,461 --> 00:47:09,970
I don't,

1511
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:13,090
I don't think that I need to be regulated,

1512
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:13,781
you know,

1513
00:47:13,781 --> 00:47:15,370
if I've done nothing wrong,

1514
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:20,520
I don't think I need to be signed up to
some system to prove that a relationship

1515
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:22,360
that I'm in is valuable to me.

1516
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:22,961
It just,

1517
00:47:22,961 --> 00:47:24,190
it seems stupid.

1518
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:25,750
It's almost seems like it's,

1519
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:26,560
if you,

1520
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,760
if you trust someone,

1521
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:28,061
it's like,

1522
00:47:28,061 --> 00:47:28,930
I do trust you.

1523
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:30,670
I'm going to need that shit on paper.

1524
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:31,780
It's like,

1525
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:32,411
I wonder,

1526
00:47:32,411 --> 00:47:35,350
since we're assertive male
and more positions of power,

1527
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:38,470
maybe marriage often is
to more protect the woman.

1528
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:39,611
Oh,

1529
00:47:39,611 --> 00:47:40,091
maybe.

1530
00:47:40,091 --> 00:47:40,451
I mean,

1531
00:47:40,451 --> 00:47:40,720
I,

1532
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,290
I certainly think that
there's something to that,

1533
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:45,160
you know,

1534
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,110
a woman wants to feel more secure.

1535
00:47:47,111 --> 00:47:48,190
I've heard women say that.

1536
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:49,240
I've heard women,

1537
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:49,690
um,

1538
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:50,171
complete,

1539
00:47:50,171 --> 00:47:52,300
like being completely outside of them,

1540
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:55,960
eavesdropping in on a conversation
and a women were talking about,

1541
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:56,440
you know,

1542
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:00,400
I felt like much more secure
in the marriage once or in
the relationship once we

1543
00:48:00,401 --> 00:48:00,950
were married.

1544
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:01,930
It doesn't make any sense,

1545
00:48:01,931 --> 00:48:03,340
but we were together for 10 years,

1546
00:48:03,341 --> 00:48:07,060
but once we got married that I felt
like it was real and then I could relax.

1547
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:07,850
I had that part of my,

1548
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:08,140
you know,

1549
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:09,850
but that's their own social hangup,

1550
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:10,510
you know?

1551
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:11,710
I think it's just some,

1552
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:14,830
did Sandra Bullock movie shit any
different after you got married?

1553
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:15,790
Absolutely not.

1554
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:16,630
I felt like a,

1555
00:48:16,631 --> 00:48:17,620
I did something that,

1556
00:48:17,621 --> 00:48:18,610
I always thought it was ridiculous.

1557
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:20,020
Well,

1558
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:20,321
you know,

1559
00:48:20,321 --> 00:48:21,520
it's like you,

1560
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:24,030
the idea behind it of,

1561
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:27,730
of committing to a person and
then giving your all to a person,

1562
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:28,990
that's all beautiful.

1563
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:29,460
The,

1564
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:29,591
the,

1565
00:48:29,591 --> 00:48:34,591
the real problem with anything where it's
two people is who knows what those two

1566
00:48:36,341 --> 00:48:38,290
people are going to be
like five years from now,

1567
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:40,420
who knows what they're gonna
be like 10 years from now.

1568
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:43,030
And I've seen it and it's ugly.

1569
00:48:43,031 --> 00:48:48,031
I've seen people that got along great
and then the one person took a left,

1570
00:48:48,161 --> 00:48:51,340
the other person took a right and they're
stuck in the same house together and

1571
00:48:51,341 --> 00:48:52,510
they don't like each other anymore.

1572
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:54,640
And it gets really gross.

1573
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:55,960
And then when they have to separate,

1574
00:48:55,961 --> 00:48:58,660
I've seen what happens when they use
the legal system against each other.

1575
00:48:59,140 --> 00:48:59,411
I mean,

1576
00:48:59,411 --> 00:49:02,920
I wrote a whole bit about it because
I saw my friend who had to pay for his

1577
00:49:02,921 --> 00:49:03,790
wife's lawyer.

1578
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:05,290
He was,

1579
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:08,560
they were going to war and he had
to pay for the enemy's general.

1580
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:09,100
Right.

1581
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:10,570
I think it's ridiculous.

1582
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:14,170
I think the idea that if you,

1583
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:14,741
uh,

1584
00:49:14,741 --> 00:49:15,160
you know,

1585
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,420
if you're taking care of the woman,

1586
00:49:16,421 --> 00:49:17,920
you should pay some form of alimony.

1587
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:18,461
Yeah,

1588
00:49:18,461 --> 00:49:19,840
definitely the child support.

1589
00:49:19,841 --> 00:49:20,171
Yes,

1590
00:49:20,171 --> 00:49:21,004
definitely.

1591
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:22,140
You know,

1592
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:24,640
you split property that you
got when you were together.

1593
00:49:24,641 --> 00:49:25,480
I'm for that,

1594
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:26,343
I'm for all that,

1595
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:27,183
I'm for all that,

1596
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:32,310
what I'm not for is this gross system
where the lawyers play off of each other

1597
00:49:33,491 --> 00:49:37,240
and try to stretch things out because
that's how they make the most money where

1598
00:49:37,241 --> 00:49:40,960
they asked for outrageous amounts so
that you come back with like a little bit

1599
00:49:40,961 --> 00:49:43,720
less and it becomes this mad hustle.

1600
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:45,160
And like I said,

1601
00:49:45,161 --> 00:49:48,580
I am in no way saying that I'm not,

1602
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,140
I'm not pro relationship,

1603
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:54,910
but I've watched someone's life
fall apart because of a bad divorce.

1604
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:56,440
Whereas if they just broke up,

1605
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:57,940
it would be cool.

1606
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,900
But she dragged him through the mud
legally for like a year and a half,

1607
00:50:01,901 --> 00:50:02,561
two years,

1608
00:50:02,561 --> 00:50:04,720
emptied his bank account
and it was horrific,

1609
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:06,370
like targeted him.

1610
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:08,170
And that can happen you,

1611
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,970
when you're legally attached to someone,

1612
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:11,020
it just,

1613
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:12,370
whereas you could be like,

1614
00:50:12,371 --> 00:50:12,701
okay,

1615
00:50:12,701 --> 00:50:13,361
we're broken up.

1616
00:50:13,361 --> 00:50:13,870
Right.

1617
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:14,470
Well,

1618
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:15,640
I don't want to be with you anymore.

1619
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:17,170
You don't want to be with me anymore.

1620
00:50:17,171 --> 00:50:18,610
So we'll just go our separate ways.

1621
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:19,570
No.

1622
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:21,310
Well or if you had the lord,

1623
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:24,280
that's what was even squirrelier.

1624
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:26,300
There's not even any kids involved.

1625
00:50:26,330 --> 00:50:27,710
So why do you have to pay for this person

1626
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:30,440
when you described that
somebody takes left,

1627
00:50:30,441 --> 00:50:31,430
the other person takes the right.

1628
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:31,731
Yeah.

1629
00:50:31,731 --> 00:50:35,840
I think that when we started tying to
think about Mtma for couples therapy,

1630
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:40,460
cause that's one of the main people
reason people use it is for relationships.

1631
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:42,730
And there's um,

1632
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:45,170
but not all relationships
should stay together.

1633
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:47,510
So trying to do a study,

1634
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:48,670
a scientific study of,

1635
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:50,060
of MDA with couples.

1636
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:53,990
If you decide that your success
is how many of them stay married,

1637
00:50:53,991 --> 00:50:57,170
that's not necessarily
the smartest thing to do.

1638
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:00,530
So what we felt was that it would be,

1639
00:51:00,531 --> 00:51:04,940
if they make a mutual decision and
whatever that decision happens to be,

1640
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:05,893
if it can be,

1641
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:06,800
they stayed together,

1642
00:51:06,801 --> 00:51:07,431
they split up.

1643
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:09,530
If there's some kind
of mutuality about it.

1644
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:13,190
If the MTMA helps them to listen to each
other and to communicate and they can

1645
00:51:13,191 --> 00:51:14,210
make a mutual decision,

1646
00:51:14,211 --> 00:51:15,680
that would be considered a success.

1647
00:51:15,681 --> 00:51:20,681
But we haven't gone forward with that
research because politically having a

1648
00:51:21,261 --> 00:51:26,261
difficult relationship is not a disease
and we need to work in a disease context

1649
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:31,190
so that we can get prescription approval
to have legal access in a medical

1650
00:51:31,191 --> 00:51:31,860
context.

1651
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:32,510
So you,

1652
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:33,390
that's a real issue.

1653
00:51:33,391 --> 00:51:35,760
You know that was the
issue with Modafinil.

1654
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:36,660
Do you know what that is?

1655
00:51:36,661 --> 00:51:37,494
The,

1656
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:40,730
that's one of my whole vigil use agile.

1657
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:42,000
I'm using that right now.

1658
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:43,673
I am.

1659
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:44,731
I am.

1660
00:51:44,731 --> 00:51:45,720
I might as well.

1661
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:46,950
That's that shit that I've given you.

1662
00:51:46,951 --> 00:51:48,630
This stuff keeps you awake.

1663
00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:49,950
Yes.

1664
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:50,760
Well,

1665
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:51,593
Tim Ferris,

1666
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:53,310
who I respect very highly,

1667
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:54,770
I had a very interesting point about it.

1668
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:55,051
He said,

1669
00:51:55,051 --> 00:51:58,320
I don't believe there's any biological
free lunch and that's why he doesn't,

1670
00:51:58,321 --> 00:52:00,090
he didn't even put it in the four hour,

1671
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,030
whatever for our body because he was
worried that people would just start

1672
00:52:03,031 --> 00:52:04,110
chewing them like candy.

1673
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:04,950
Well,

1674
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:07,680
I happened to know somebody
that uses it for narcolepsy.

1675
00:52:07,681 --> 00:52:09,750
He uses a twice a day for about,

1676
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:10,170
uh,

1677
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:10,640
you know,

1678
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,220
that's what I'm here to say.

1679
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:15,590
The reason why it's
prescribed for narcolepsy has,

1680
00:52:15,591 --> 00:52:19,460
because they initially created it for
performance enhancing purposes and then

1681
00:52:19,461 --> 00:52:20,200
the government's like,

1682
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:20,451
um,

1683
00:52:20,451 --> 00:52:22,910
you can't just like say I
want my brain to work better.

1684
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:27,920
Like you have to have a disease so they
go narcolepsy and that's how it got

1685
00:52:27,921 --> 00:52:28,430
approved.

1686
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:29,090
Right.

1687
00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:29,510
Right.

1688
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:30,410
But it was probably,

1689
00:52:30,411 --> 00:52:31,340
it works for narcolepsy.

1690
00:52:31,370 --> 00:52:31,581
Okay.

1691
00:52:31,581 --> 00:52:32,560
And I got to use it.

1692
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:35,000
People falling asleep all the time.

1693
00:52:35,001 --> 00:52:36,770
They're conking out with this stuff.

1694
00:52:36,771 --> 00:52:37,790
Does it keep you awake?

1695
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:38,111
Yeah,

1696
00:52:38,111 --> 00:52:38,740
but it doesn't,

1697
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:40,330
it's pretty transparent.

1698
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,160
It doesn't add a lot of other things.

1699
00:52:42,161 --> 00:52:43,390
So it's very weird.

1700
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:46,090
The military is actually shifting towards,

1701
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:46,631
towards it,

1702
00:52:46,631 --> 00:52:49,270
away from speed and amphetamines.

1703
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:49,620
Oh,

1704
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:50,430
that's smart.

1705
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:51,090
Yeah.

1706
00:52:51,090 --> 00:52:55,710
Speed fucks you up and makes you do shitty
things and the next you make terrible

1707
00:52:55,711 --> 00:52:56,370
decisions.

1708
00:52:56,370 --> 00:52:57,930
Poor decision making capabilities.

1709
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:00,240
And that's worse than
alcohol and a lot of ways.

1710
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:00,720
Yeah.

1711
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:03,810
And it's a Modafinil is also for jet lag,

1712
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:05,130
for shift work.

1713
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:06,290
And,

1714
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:06,510
uh,

1715
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:06,691
you know,

1716
00:53:06,691 --> 00:53:10,020
the only reason I took it tonight is
because I was caught in the gay pride

1717
00:53:10,021 --> 00:53:13,310
parade for Francisco
couldn't get out of town.

1718
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:13,841
They got you.

1719
00:53:13,841 --> 00:53:15,300
And so I just wanted to,

1720
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:16,683
um,

1721
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:19,260
how easy is it to get
prescribed something like that?

1722
00:53:19,261 --> 00:53:20,280
Because as an example,

1723
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:20,850
I,

1724
00:53:20,850 --> 00:53:22,590
I had just got off cigarettes.

1725
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:23,490
I wake up,

1726
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:23,881
you know,

1727
00:53:23,881 --> 00:53:25,110
I could barely get out of bed.

1728
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:26,040
Whole Day is

1729
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,240
just like I can,

1730
00:53:27,241 --> 00:53:28,230
I just lay back down.

1731
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:30,200
I take one fourth of a,

1732
00:53:30,201 --> 00:53:32,670
an Adderall and 20 minutes
later I'm just like,

1733
00:53:32,671 --> 00:53:33,570
how much work can I do?

1734
00:53:33,571 --> 00:53:33,841
And I can,

1735
00:53:33,841 --> 00:53:34,160
oh my gosh,

1736
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:34,870
my brain's like,

1737
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:35,640
that's a lie.

1738
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:36,473
And it's working.

1739
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:36,930
That's,

1740
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:39,360
but that's a completely
different sort of experience.

1741
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:40,250
But for something like,

1742
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:41,460
like that,

1743
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:42,010
it's,

1744
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:45,000
it's also given to people
that have like weird shifts,

1745
00:53:45,001 --> 00:53:45,301
you know,

1746
00:53:45,301 --> 00:53:45,781
jobs,

1747
00:53:45,781 --> 00:53:46,950
entertainers and stuff.

1748
00:53:46,951 --> 00:53:47,240
You know,

1749
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,660
a lot of times I'm talking too much.

1750
00:53:48,661 --> 00:53:49,560
I can get your prescription.

1751
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:50,330
Oh,

1752
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:51,163
okay.

1753
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:52,960
You go to a doctor tell you,

1754
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:53,561
don't worry.

1755
00:53:53,561 --> 00:53:54,101
I got a doctor.

1756
00:53:54,101 --> 00:53:54,420
Okay.

1757
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:55,253
Jesus.

1758
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:55,580
No,

1759
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:58,060
my main person I guess.

1760
00:53:58,061 --> 00:53:58,341
Is it,

1761
00:53:58,341 --> 00:53:59,860
is it something that's hard to know?

1762
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:00,790
I know people who've done it.

1763
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:01,240
Good.

1764
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:01,691
A doctor.

1765
00:54:01,691 --> 00:54:02,530
I'm not feeling so good.

1766
00:54:02,531 --> 00:54:03,041
I'm sleepy.

1767
00:54:03,041 --> 00:54:03,330
I think

1768
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:04,620
this is something called new vigil.

1769
00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:05,940
I think maybe that'll help me.

1770
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:06,271
Boom,

1771
00:54:06,271 --> 00:54:06,571
Bang,

1772
00:54:06,571 --> 00:54:06,850
boom.

1773
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:07,030
Shut.

1774
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:07,291
Bam.

1775
00:54:07,291 --> 00:54:08,310
You're out the door with description.

1776
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:09,690
We're trying to give out prescriptions,

1777
00:54:09,691 --> 00:54:10,200
man.

1778
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,440
Doctors are trying to
give you prescriptions.

1779
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:13,560
Do you know that?

1780
00:54:13,561 --> 00:54:14,940
You want to hear something fucking crazy.

1781
00:54:15,410 --> 00:54:17,250
There was something in Montana the,

1782
00:54:17,251 --> 00:54:22,020
they recently released where Montana
has x amount of people living in it.

1783
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:25,710
One fourth of them around oxycontin's

1784
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:27,841
no,

1785
00:54:27,841 --> 00:54:28,800
fucking crazy.

1786
00:54:28,801 --> 00:54:29,430
That is,

1787
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:32,910
I need to verify that because
someone told me that today.

1788
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:33,860
Uh,

1789
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:35,090
oxycontin's

1790
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:40,030
I guess I just never tried to go
get prescription medicine ever.

1791
00:54:40,090 --> 00:54:40,923
Well

1792
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:45,160
I think there's a time when,

1793
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:45,940
uh,

1794
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:46,773
if it's,

1795
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:47,613
um,

1796
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,930
possibly helpful that
it can be okay to do it.

1797
00:54:49,931 --> 00:54:53,020
I think I prefer trying to do
things on my own without it.

1798
00:54:53,021 --> 00:54:54,310
And then only if it's,

1799
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:55,510
um,

1800
00:54:55,510 --> 00:54:59,200
beyond my capabilities or
something that I think enhances it.

1801
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:00,130
So I think the,

1802
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:01,450
uh,

1803
00:55:01,450 --> 00:55:03,580
the idea of a jet lag shift,

1804
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:06,610
you doctors do want you to have a,

1805
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:07,693
um,

1806
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,180
relationship to what it was approved for.

1807
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:14,680
But around 40% of the prescriptions
in America are called off label.

1808
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:18,310
We're doctors prescribe it for things
that it's not been approved for.

1809
00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:18,910
Oh.

1810
00:55:18,910 --> 00:55:20,530
And that cannot be stopped.

1811
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,000
That's not bad.

1812
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:24,550
What's some of the things that
this drug is used off label,

1813
00:55:24,551 --> 00:55:25,270
I guess?

1814
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:25,571
Well,

1815
00:55:25,571 --> 00:55:26,760
I think it's a

1816
00:55:27,850 --> 00:55:28,541
off label.

1817
00:55:28,541 --> 00:55:31,840
People are just taking it for
performance enhancing substance reasons.

1818
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:32,711
That's why they're doing it.

1819
00:55:32,711 --> 00:55:35,230
That's the big reason that I always here.

1820
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,040
And the big diseases narcotic.

1821
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:38,631
Yeah.

1822
00:55:38,631 --> 00:55:39,940
And the concern is that,

1823
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:40,400
um,

1824
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:40,671
you know,

1825
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:42,620
if people have performance
enhancing drugs,

1826
00:55:42,621 --> 00:55:47,120
but they're willing to hurt themselves
in order to do it because there's no free

1827
00:55:47,121 --> 00:55:47,954
lunch.

1828
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,440
But with modafinil there,

1829
00:55:49,490 --> 00:55:54,490
there are ranges of use of certain drugs
where it doesn't seem like there are

1830
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:56,320
harmful constant.

1831
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:56,580
Well,

1832
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:58,680
it Montana,

1833
00:55:58,681 --> 00:55:59,670
a gazette,

1834
00:55:59,671 --> 00:56:02,610
the billings gazette is
the one that printed this.

1835
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:02,820
It's,

1836
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:07,230
it is one out of four
that's unfucking believable.

1837
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:10,260
Montana has just under
a million residents.

1838
00:56:10,261 --> 00:56:13,020
One out of four have an
oxycontin prescription.

1839
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:14,580
It's incredible.

1840
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:16,193
Huh?

1841
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:17,291
Is that pain?

1842
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:18,310
I wonder how they,

1843
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:19,810
listen.

1844
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:20,920
I have,

1845
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:26,280
I've gone in for operations and they
gave me a all kinds of shit that I didn't

1846
00:56:26,501 --> 00:56:26,861
tank,

1847
00:56:26,861 --> 00:56:27,511
but they'll,

1848
00:56:27,511 --> 00:56:30,550
they'll give you whatever
you need for pain.

1849
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:35,580
Even did you tell him it's nothing I went
into to get a deviated septum and uh,

1850
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:36,890
they,

1851
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:38,800
it's kind of uncomfortable thing,

1852
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:42,370
stuff your nose and they crack
it and break it and widen it.

1853
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:46,060
I had a really fucked up
septum and it was kind of,

1854
00:56:46,061 --> 00:56:46,571
I literally,

1855
00:56:46,571 --> 00:56:49,330
my nose was useless for most of my
life until I had this operation.

1856
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:53,140
But my doctor gave me like two
different kinds of pain killers and I,

1857
00:56:53,141 --> 00:56:53,890
and I was like,

1858
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:54,790
this doesn't even hurt though.

1859
00:56:54,791 --> 00:56:55,091
He's like,

1860
00:56:55,091 --> 00:56:56,470
well it's going to probably tonight,

1861
00:56:56,471 --> 00:56:58,480
tonight you're probably going
to be in significant pain.

1862
00:56:58,990 --> 00:56:59,823
Never came.

1863
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:00,160
It was like,

1864
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:00,971
it was weird.

1865
00:57:00,971 --> 00:57:01,721
I had this stuffed,

1866
00:57:01,721 --> 00:57:02,800
stuffed up my nose,

1867
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:04,000
but there was no pain.

1868
00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:05,260
But meanwhile,

1869
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:09,880
if you're a person is easily addictive
and you take one of those and you go,

1870
00:57:09,881 --> 00:57:10,371
God damn it,

1871
00:57:10,371 --> 00:57:10,991
I can't sleep.

1872
00:57:10,991 --> 00:57:12,340
And then you take two more of those.

1873
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:13,301
And the next thing I know,

1874
00:57:13,301 --> 00:57:15,520
you're going to another doctor
and telling me you're in pain.

1875
00:57:15,521 --> 00:57:18,220
You get a second prescription
and you're off to the races.

1876
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:18,551
Yeah.

1877
00:57:18,551 --> 00:57:20,480
We had one of the veterans and our,

1878
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:21,220
uh,

1879
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:22,300
PTSD study,

1880
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:23,523
um,

1881
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:24,731
took one dose,

1882
00:57:24,731 --> 00:57:29,530
dropped out of the study and under the
influence of this medium dose of Mtma,

1883
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:30,370
um,

1884
00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:33,100
he started feeling that
he was taking pain meds,

1885
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:34,630
not just for the pain,

1886
00:57:34,631 --> 00:57:37,540
but he was kind of getting addicted,

1887
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:40,330
depended on them and he didn't
want to do that anymore.

1888
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:41,630
We're war wounds,

1889
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:42,191
things like that.

1890
00:57:42,191 --> 00:57:47,110
And so he decided that he didn't need
the pain meds anymore and he also felt

1891
00:57:47,111 --> 00:57:52,111
like he had come to terms with the issues
that had caused him to be suffering

1892
00:57:52,661 --> 00:57:54,040
from post traumatic stress disorder,

1893
00:57:54,041 --> 00:57:58,630
that he accepted these things and that
he could go forward without a PTSD.

1894
00:57:58,631 --> 00:58:00,160
And so he dropped out of the study,

1895
00:58:00,161 --> 00:58:00,671
but we said,

1896
00:58:00,671 --> 00:58:02,380
we want to ask you at two months,

1897
00:58:02,381 --> 00:58:03,340
in 12 months,

1898
00:58:03,341 --> 00:58:04,150
our followups,

1899
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:04,983
how you're doing.

1900
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:07,450
And his PTSD was still gone after a year.

1901
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:08,550
That's amazing.

1902
00:58:08,551 --> 00:58:09,840
The PTSD,

1903
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:10,200
um,

1904
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:10,940
use,

1905
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:11,310
uh,

1906
00:58:11,310 --> 00:58:13,920
the use of Mtma for PTSD is a,

1907
00:58:13,921 --> 00:58:17,430
one of the ones that was
discussed recently by this,

1908
00:58:17,431 --> 00:58:21,900
a soldier who wrote this very eloquent
letter and then committed suicide when he

1909
00:58:21,901 --> 00:58:26,290
was talking about the Dea [inaudible]
letter on the airplane here.

1910
00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:26,820
Yeah,

1911
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:27,511
I assumed that it was,

1912
00:58:27,511 --> 00:58:28,440
when he was talking about,

1913
00:58:28,670 --> 00:58:29,300
it's a big,

1914
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:30,290
big issue with,

1915
00:58:30,291 --> 00:58:30,510
uh,

1916
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:31,200
with veterans.

1917
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,300
I assumed he was talking about marijuana,

1918
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:34,650
what can I do as well?

1919
00:58:34,651 --> 00:58:37,170
But I thought it was Mtma probably both,

1920
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:40,860
but the MDM main one has been discussed
a lot by friends that I have that have

1921
00:58:40,861 --> 00:58:41,700
been in the military.

1922
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:44,880
They know it helps and
they want to know about it.

1923
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:45,250
You know,

1924
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:50,250
I heard it's the one where you hear a lot
of people going through very traumatic

1925
00:58:50,611 --> 00:58:52,590
things and then they get over it.

1926
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:53,310
They're okay,

1927
00:58:53,310 --> 00:58:55,590
they understand it and
accept it and that's it.

1928
00:58:55,770 --> 00:58:56,310
Yeah,

1929
00:58:56,310 --> 00:58:57,091
they've heard about it.

1930
00:58:57,091 --> 00:58:57,511
Anyway,

1931
00:58:57,511 --> 00:59:01,710
we had a meeting in the Pentagon where
we are trying to get formal cooperation

1932
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:06,570
and they expressed that their biggest
fear was that if they were to cooperate on

1933
00:59:06,571 --> 00:59:07,590
an MDA study,

1934
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,340
that the word would get
out Moreso than before.

1935
00:59:11,370 --> 00:59:13,740
And that a lot of people
who were in the military,

1936
00:59:13,770 --> 00:59:17,130
who only a small number of them
will get into clinical studies,

1937
00:59:17,131 --> 00:59:22,131
that they would go out on their own and
get stuff that was impure or not in s or

1938
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:27,590
pure but not in a safe place and that
there that would cause more harm.

1939
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:29,390
And they said that
shouldn't stop the research,

1940
00:59:29,391 --> 00:59:33,650
but that that was the concern and
what we're thinking of saying it,

1941
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:37,550
what would we did say is that the word
is getting out and we've had articles in

1942
00:59:37,551 --> 00:59:42,410
Stars and Stripes and the Marine Corps
times and military.com about the results

1943
00:59:42,411 --> 00:59:43,200
of our study.

1944
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,640
I think they owed to the soldiers.

1945
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:49,050
And I think that if they wanted to start
a Kickstarter to have MTMA clinics pop

1946
00:59:49,051 --> 00:59:50,280
up with a legitimate stuff,

1947
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:53,010
government approved and tested
all throughout the country,

1948
00:59:53,070 --> 00:59:53,340
it would,

1949
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:54,440
it could be user funded.

1950
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:56,560
We are going to do that
with the Indiegogo.

1951
00:59:56,561 --> 01:00:01,561
Kickstarter doesn't take medical shows
but Indeigogo does and we are going to

1952
01:00:01,781 --> 01:00:05,560
try to do it to crowdsource a
support for the study with veterans,

1953
01:00:05,561 --> 01:00:07,210
firefighters and police officers.

1954
01:00:07,211 --> 01:00:07,840
Great idea.

1955
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:11,260
The thing about the psychedelics so
that people understand what we're really

1956
01:00:11,261 --> 01:00:14,530
talking about with the psychedelic
Madison is it's only used a few times.

1957
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:18,610
It's not like the drugs that we were
talking about that people get prescribed

1958
01:00:18,611 --> 01:00:20,680
every day or several times a day.

1959
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:26,140
It's only part of a psychotherapeutic
process with more non drug psychotherapy

1960
01:00:26,141 --> 01:00:29,380
sessions and what they
can integrate from it.

1961
01:00:29,381 --> 01:00:32,830
So our three and a half
month program for Ptsd,

1962
01:00:33,090 --> 01:00:33,670
uh,

1963
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:36,040
treatment includes only
three days of Mtma.

1964
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:41,370
I think people need to understand that
all these things are tools that have been

1965
01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:42,204
denied us.

1966
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:43,160
And uh,

1967
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:44,010
that deal,

1968
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:47,070
I used to joke about it that
like marijuana is like a hammer.

1969
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:47,761
You know,

1970
01:00:47,761 --> 01:00:48,330
you could,

1971
01:00:48,330 --> 01:00:51,030
you could hammer nails with it or you
could just hit yourself with a dick if

1972
01:00:51,031 --> 01:00:51,960
you're fucking crazy,

1973
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:52,321
right?

1974
01:00:52,321 --> 01:00:54,840
Like just cause you have a tool doesn't
mean you're going to use it properly.

1975
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:57,910
And when you smoke too much
pot and freak out and when you,

1976
01:00:57,911 --> 01:00:58,330
you know,

1977
01:00:58,330 --> 01:01:00,030
take acid and jump off a roof.

1978
01:01:00,210 --> 01:01:02,060
Yes you've done it improperly,

1979
01:01:02,070 --> 01:01:07,050
but you're dealing with this incredibly
complex thing that is really not being

1980
01:01:07,051 --> 01:01:08,760
explained to the general public.

1981
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:14,420
The dabbling in psychedelics is all sort
of done with anecdotal evidence passed

1982
01:01:14,761 --> 01:01:17,870
on by friends or books that
you've read or all the,

1983
01:01:17,871 --> 01:01:18,271
all these,

1984
01:01:18,271 --> 01:01:20,940
you know and it's
unnecessary at this point.

1985
01:01:20,941 --> 01:01:22,140
We have enough information.

1986
01:01:22,141 --> 01:01:22,801
There's enough data.

1987
01:01:22,801 --> 01:01:24,990
There's enough online@maps.org

1988
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:25,610
yeah,

1989
01:01:25,610 --> 01:01:26,600
add mass that are we,

1990
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:28,750
we are doing drug development in the open.

1991
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:29,990
We publish our protocols,

1992
01:01:29,991 --> 01:01:31,820
we publish our data,

1993
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:35,030
we publish all of our timelines of ours,

1994
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,650
relationships with regulatory.

1995
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:39,050
We publish our review of the literature.

1996
01:01:39,051 --> 01:01:44,051
We have a treatment manual that describes
what the therapy component is that

1997
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:45,920
they are with our adherence criteria.

1998
01:01:45,921 --> 01:01:50,870
We're trying to make the all of it
publicly available and at the same time

1999
01:01:50,871 --> 01:01:54,140
that's the pressure that's coming on
the pharmaceutical companies actually to

2000
01:01:54,141 --> 01:01:55,310
release more of their data.

2001
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:59,330
But the important thing is that the
DEA is not stopping MTMA research.

2002
01:01:59,331 --> 01:02:00,770
The FDA is not stopping.

2003
01:02:00,771 --> 01:02:05,450
We are able to do psychedelic research
in the United States and most countries

2004
01:02:05,451 --> 01:02:06,980
of the world where we want to.

2005
01:02:06,981 --> 01:02:08,450
We have studies right now in Israel,

2006
01:02:08,451 --> 01:02:09,051
Switzerland,

2007
01:02:09,051 --> 01:02:09,884
Canada,

2008
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:11,240
and we've done,

2009
01:02:11,241 --> 01:02:14,690
I began research in
Mexico and New Zealand,

2010
01:02:14,691 --> 01:02:16,340
I wasco research in Canada,

2011
01:02:16,610 --> 01:02:21,610
so that the only thing that's really
politically blocked right now is marijuana

2012
01:02:21,781 --> 01:02:22,614
research.

2013
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:24,420
It's hilarious.

2014
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:25,770
It's shocking,

2015
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:27,370
but it's true.

2016
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:30,300
You're getting all this
research done and this is,

2017
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:31,440
this is very new,

2018
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:33,060
like two decades ago,

2019
01:02:33,061 --> 01:02:34,140
this was not possible.

2020
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:35,370
It was impossible.

2021
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:36,990
And when did it start being possible?

2022
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:37,171
Well,

2023
01:02:37,171 --> 01:02:38,760
actually what happened was,

2024
01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:42,510
and I did my dissertation at the
Harvard Kennedy School of Government,

2025
01:02:42,511 --> 01:02:44,040
I got my master's and phd there,

2026
01:02:44,041 --> 01:02:47,100
and the part of my dissertation
was on how this happened.

2027
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:51,210
Who at the FDA change things
and was it other places as well?

2028
01:02:51,211 --> 01:02:52,590
Was it a social consensus?

2029
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:56,970
And it turns out that in the
late 1980s there was a lot of,

2030
01:02:57,390 --> 01:02:59,670
particularly Reagan had
been before pro business.

2031
01:02:59,671 --> 01:03:03,780
There was a lot of concern that the
FDA was too slow evaluating drugs,

2032
01:03:03,781 --> 01:03:07,110
that they were mostly trying to block
risks and they didn't care that much about

2033
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:08,580
treating illness.

2034
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:13,470
And so the FDA set up this group
called the pilot drug evaluation staff,

2035
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:18,900
which was that they would pilot drug
evaluation methods to try to speed up the

2036
01:03:18,901 --> 01:03:20,580
drug review process.

2037
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:24,000
And this group needed drugs
to actually work with.

2038
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:27,570
And so they looked around the other
pro parts of the FDA and they kind of

2039
01:03:27,571 --> 01:03:31,260
cobbled together different kinds of drugs
and they looked at the people that had

2040
01:03:31,261 --> 01:03:33,960
control over scheduled
drugs and marijuana,

2041
01:03:33,961 --> 01:03:34,890
all the psychedelics,

2042
01:03:35,370 --> 01:03:39,420
and they had been suppressing
things for decades and they said,

2043
01:03:39,421 --> 01:03:39,631
sure,

2044
01:03:39,631 --> 01:03:40,464
we'll give this up.

2045
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:42,780
And so this new branch came,

2046
01:03:42,781 --> 01:03:43,614
they didn't,

2047
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:46,950
but they also were more
science over politics.

2048
01:03:47,010 --> 01:03:52,010
So starting in 1990 the first study was
approved with Dmt by Rick Strassman.

2049
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:58,440
And we had tried for five studies before
for years before with the Mtma all

2050
01:03:58,441 --> 01:03:59,011
rejected.

2051
01:03:59,011 --> 01:04:00,930
But once this new team got into place,

2052
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:01,830
uh,

2053
01:04:01,830 --> 01:04:06,030
then they had to review our study
Mtma for cancer patients with anxiety.

2054
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:11,210
And there was a 1992 advisory committee
meeting to determine whether the FDA

2055
01:04:12,270 --> 01:04:15,840
would go forward with psychedelic research
and they did it bureaucratically in a

2056
01:04:15,841 --> 01:04:16,674
brilliant way.

2057
01:04:16,830 --> 01:04:18,090
They had the DEA there,

2058
01:04:18,091 --> 01:04:19,620
they had the uh,

2059
01:04:19,621 --> 01:04:21,480
office of National Drug Control Policy.

2060
01:04:21,481 --> 01:04:23,250
They had the national
institute on Drug Abuse.

2061
01:04:23,251 --> 01:04:28,251
They had representatives from all of
these branches and they proposed an idea

2062
01:04:28,771 --> 01:04:32,670
and their idea was that the regulations
that they put on the major drugs for the

2063
01:04:32,671 --> 01:04:37,671
pharmaceutical industries that the risks
of the medical use of psychedelics and

2064
01:04:37,921 --> 01:04:38,580
marijuana,

2065
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:39,600
we're no different.

2066
01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:44,070
And so they would treat these drugs as
if they were drugs being developed by the

2067
01:04:44,071 --> 01:04:45,150
pharmaceutical industry.

2068
01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:47,130
And the same procedures would be fine.

2069
01:04:47,131 --> 01:04:48,270
And the Dea,

2070
01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:49,020
Nita,

2071
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:49,441
the drugs,

2072
01:04:49,441 --> 01:04:49,981
ours office,

2073
01:04:49,981 --> 01:04:50,461
they all thought,

2074
01:04:50,461 --> 01:04:52,140
man you put it in there,

2075
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:52,830
they'll,

2076
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:56,940
it'll never get out again because who can
act like the pharmaceutical companies.

2077
01:04:57,510 --> 01:05:01,380
And so they all signed off and FDA
got this policy in 1992 and then they

2078
01:05:01,381 --> 01:05:03,180
approved our first study with Mtma,

2079
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,220
which was a safety study.

2080
01:05:05,850 --> 01:05:10,650
And then they started approving studies
with psilocybin and then expanding our

2081
01:05:10,651 --> 01:05:12,900
MD may studies into patient populations.

2082
01:05:12,990 --> 01:05:17,990
So there's a 20 year history now and a
lot of track record and data and now we

2083
01:05:19,001 --> 01:05:20,740
have data on the benefits side,

2084
01:05:20,741 --> 01:05:25,240
not just on the risk side so that we
can talk about balancing before people

2085
01:05:25,241 --> 01:05:26,650
could say there are no benefits,

2086
01:05:26,651 --> 01:05:27,670
there's these risks,

2087
01:05:27,671 --> 01:05:29,830
therefore nothing's permitted.

2088
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:34,180
So the dynamics have completely
changed and we've demonstrated so far,

2089
01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:38,800
over 800 people have taken Mtma and
clinical research all over the world.

2090
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:40,840
And you know,

2091
01:05:40,841 --> 01:05:41,674
nobody's gone.

2092
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:46,960
Nobody's had a serious adverse
event that left them harmful.

2093
01:05:46,961 --> 01:05:49,900
Nobody has become addicts
as far as we know to Mtma.

2094
01:05:49,901 --> 01:05:50,980
Nobody went crazy.

2095
01:05:51,370 --> 01:05:53,860
So we've demonstrated
there are safe places.

2096
01:05:53,861 --> 01:05:58,861
Our study with LSD and Switzerland for
people who are dying was 12 people and 11

2097
01:05:59,441 --> 01:06:01,300
of them had never done LSD before.

2098
01:06:01,630 --> 01:06:02,620
So it's not,

2099
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:07,680
we're trying to show that it can be
brought to people who are not from this

2100
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:08,591
culture,

2101
01:06:08,591 --> 01:06:09,550
not used to this,

2102
01:06:09,551 --> 01:06:14,050
but it can be helpful to
them in a controlled setting
with supportive therapists

2103
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:16,750
and with a lot of integration
and preparation work.

2104
01:06:17,170 --> 01:06:21,220
And people were aware of a other
studies like the Johns Hopkins study on

2105
01:06:21,221 --> 01:06:24,220
Psilocybin now that's gotten
a lot of steam because,

2106
01:06:24,221 --> 01:06:24,790
uh,

2107
01:06:24,790 --> 01:06:29,070
these people many years later experienced
great personality benefits that stuck

2108
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:29,730
with them.

2109
01:06:29,730 --> 01:06:30,001
Yeah.

2110
01:06:30,001 --> 01:06:30,660
That was,

2111
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:31,493
um,

2112
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:36,500
the study of psilocybin and people who
were spiritually inclined to see if they

2113
01:06:36,631 --> 01:06:41,100
could have a spiritual experience that
actually there was the classic study that

2114
01:06:41,101 --> 01:06:46,101
that's modeled on was called the Good
Friday experiment and it was done in 1962

2115
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:49,710
and it was one of the best things
that Timothy leary ever dead.

2116
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:52,730
And I ended up doing
a 25 year followup to,

2117
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:53,880
at tracking these people down.

2118
01:06:53,881 --> 01:06:55,890
But basically in 1962,

2119
01:06:56,280 --> 01:07:01,280
lots of people thought that psychedelics
had some genuine spiritual potential.

2120
01:07:01,950 --> 01:07:06,950
And Martin Luther King was getting a
phd at Boston University and his mentor

2121
01:07:07,441 --> 01:07:09,240
there was Reverend Howard Thurman.

2122
01:07:09,270 --> 01:07:12,000
This dynamic black minister
who's just fantastic,

2123
01:07:12,330 --> 01:07:16,140
and he agreed to have Timothy
leary and Ram Das and others,

2124
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:21,030
20 people and 10 guides come into
their church on Good Friday and do an

2125
01:07:21,031 --> 01:07:21,930
experiment.

2126
01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:25,950
And these were all students from Andover
Newton theological seminary and half of

2127
01:07:25,951 --> 01:07:26,220
them,

2128
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:27,180
they all got pills,

2129
01:07:27,570 --> 01:07:28,860
half were psilocybin,

2130
01:07:29,190 --> 01:07:30,120
30 milligrams,

2131
01:07:30,121 --> 01:07:31,110
which is pretty strong.

2132
01:07:31,110 --> 01:07:33,150
And the other half was nicotinic acid,

2133
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:36,180
which gives you this hot
flush and it acts quicker.

2134
01:07:36,181 --> 01:07:38,100
So that was going to
be there double blind.

2135
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:43,640
And then they went through the Good Friday
service and Walter Pankey who did the

2136
01:07:43,951 --> 01:07:44,311
study,

2137
01:07:44,311 --> 01:07:46,770
was a doctor or a minister
and getting a phd at Harvard.

2138
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:50,940
And he had spent a year going through the
world's mystical literature to develop

2139
01:07:50,941 --> 01:07:53,730
a questionnaire for what
the mystical experience was.

2140
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:58,650
And he extracted all specific mentions of,

2141
01:07:59,050 --> 01:07:59,460
you know,

2142
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:02,670
Jesus or Moses or it's
just more of this abstract,

2143
01:08:02,671 --> 01:08:06,870
what is a mystical experience and
administered this questionnaire.

2144
01:08:06,871 --> 01:08:11,871
And nine out of the 20 people had either
a partial or a full mystical experience

2145
01:08:12,931 --> 01:08:15,150
and eight out of those
nine had the psilocybin.

2146
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:19,610
And so the conclusion was that for
people who are religiously inclined in a

2147
01:08:19,611 --> 01:08:20,660
religious setting,

2148
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:23,540
you can have a psychedelic drugs.

2149
01:08:23,570 --> 01:08:27,680
Psilocybin does precipitate what seems
to be a genuine mystical experience,

2150
01:08:27,681 --> 01:08:28,880
not a hallucination,

2151
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:31,130
but in the mystical literature,

2152
01:08:31,131 --> 01:08:34,760
the real test is called the fruits
test is what does it you bring back,

2153
01:08:34,761 --> 01:08:36,710
what are the fruits of this experience?

2154
01:08:37,370 --> 01:08:38,870
And that only comes with time.

2155
01:08:39,290 --> 01:08:43,310
And Mulder Pankey who did the study died
from a scuba diving diving accident in

2156
01:08:43,311 --> 01:08:46,040
1971 and so he would have done this,

2157
01:08:46,041 --> 01:08:49,760
but in the middle eighties when I
was getting my undergraduate degree,

2158
01:08:49,761 --> 01:08:54,290
I decided to track these people down
for my senior thesis at New College of

2159
01:08:54,291 --> 01:08:54,800
Florida,

2160
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,510
which is this experimental school.

2161
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:58,880
And my father was really helpful.

2162
01:08:58,881 --> 01:08:59,511
My mother was too.

2163
01:08:59,511 --> 01:09:04,250
I identified 19 out of the 20 and
was able to interview 16 of them.

2164
01:09:04,610 --> 01:09:07,460
And what I found was that the
people who had the placebo,

2165
01:09:07,730 --> 01:09:10,370
most of them didn't
remember it that vividly,

2166
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:15,020
but the people who had the silicide bun
had very vivid memories of parts of it.

2167
01:09:15,410 --> 01:09:19,520
And at the same time they said that
they considered it to be a genuine

2168
01:09:19,521 --> 01:09:23,480
experience that had non drug mystical
experiences since they preferred the

2169
01:09:23,481 --> 01:09:26,990
non-drug mystical experiences cause
they were more uniformly positive.

2170
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:32,720
They lost their fear of death and they
felt more focused on the here and now and

2171
01:09:32,721 --> 01:09:36,230
on social justice cause they had this
unit of experience that helped them

2172
01:09:36,231 --> 01:09:38,660
identify with the planet,

2173
01:09:38,661 --> 01:09:39,321
with the people,

2174
01:09:39,321 --> 01:09:42,980
with not so much that all
the divisions that divide us,

2175
01:09:42,981 --> 01:09:44,330
they saw deeper unity.

2176
01:09:44,331 --> 01:09:48,470
And so they were more social
justice minded and activists.

2177
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:52,220
And I think that's a little bit of
a key to the 60s as psychedelics go.

2178
01:09:52,221 --> 01:09:53,054
Right.

2179
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:58,240
They inspire people to try to make
a better world and we can do that.

2180
01:09:58,581 --> 01:10:00,110
Not In an oppositional way,

2181
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:02,720
but we can do it with in
the heart of the culture.

2182
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:04,340
And that's the challenge that we face.

2183
01:10:04,430 --> 01:10:08,060
It's really interesting that you said
that what they had was a real religious

2184
01:10:08,061 --> 01:10:10,730
experience or real mystical experience.

2185
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:11,540
Um,

2186
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:14,840
one of the things has been on my mind,

2187
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:15,230
uh,

2188
01:10:15,230 --> 01:10:18,230
over the last few months when it comes
to psychedelic parents is that when

2189
01:10:18,231 --> 01:10:19,100
people want to tell you,

2190
01:10:19,310 --> 01:10:19,551
oh,

2191
01:10:19,551 --> 01:10:20,180
you're just,

2192
01:10:20,180 --> 01:10:21,490
something is going on,

2193
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:22,700
your imagination,

2194
01:10:22,701 --> 01:10:23,241
you create,

2195
01:10:23,241 --> 01:10:27,590
your visual Cortex is getting stimulated
by this drug and it's creating a bunch

2196
01:10:27,591 --> 01:10:28,430
of hallucinations.

2197
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:30,410
It could be that,

2198
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:32,900
but it also could be something else.

2199
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:38,230
It could be you are experiencing
some divine state of consciousness.

2200
01:10:38,571 --> 01:10:43,571
You are in contact with some other
form of intelligence and either it's a

2201
01:10:44,781 --> 01:10:47,960
hallucination or it's this
other real experience.

2202
01:10:47,961 --> 01:10:52,010
But either way you have
the exact same experience.

2203
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:55,910
Whether you really went to a place
and talked to super spiritual,

2204
01:10:55,911 --> 01:10:57,200
highly intelligent beings,

2205
01:10:57,260 --> 01:10:59,210
or you imagined you did,

2206
01:10:59,390 --> 01:11:02,300
you're still having the
exact same experience.

2207
01:11:02,510 --> 01:11:04,400
And it's incredibly vivid.

2208
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:05,000
Yeah.

2209
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,540
That's the one of the weirdest aspects
about any sort of psychedelic experiences

2210
01:11:08,541 --> 01:11:11,840
that they're almost more
real than reality itself.

2211
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:15,870
And I think because that it's even more
important that we keep our critical

2212
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:20,871
faculties in a way because we are
always a filter and our culture,

2213
01:11:21,001 --> 01:11:21,720
how are,

2214
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:25,380
so I don't think we're ever seeing
absolute reality or the truth.

2215
01:11:25,381 --> 01:11:28,320
And I think that's where you get
in danger where people think,

2216
01:11:28,321 --> 01:11:28,800
I,

2217
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:29,041
you know,

2218
01:11:29,041 --> 01:11:29,851
God spoke to me,

2219
01:11:29,851 --> 01:11:34,851
God said this or I know this for sure
because there is our filter that we're

2220
01:11:35,401 --> 01:11:36,151
seeing it through.

2221
01:11:36,151 --> 01:11:39,420
But you try to see as much as you can.

2222
01:11:39,421 --> 01:11:42,070
But I think we have to be aware that,

2223
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:42,690
uh,

2224
01:11:42,690 --> 01:11:45,750
and be cautious and see
how it works in life.

2225
01:11:45,751 --> 01:11:49,770
So under LSD therapy and Mtma therapy
would tell people don't make decisions

2226
01:11:49,771 --> 01:11:52,170
while you're doing the therapy,

2227
01:11:52,171 --> 01:11:52,411
you know,

2228
01:11:52,411 --> 01:11:55,460
wait for a couple of
weeks after or you know,

2229
01:11:55,470 --> 01:11:58,020
at least under the
influence is for exploring,

2230
01:11:58,021 --> 01:11:59,430
not for deciding.

2231
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:00,330
Hmm.

2232
01:12:00,330 --> 01:12:01,140
That's interesting.

2233
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:03,090
Although some things do get changed

2234
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:04,300
cause sometimes though you have,

2235
01:12:04,301 --> 01:12:04,541
yeah,

2236
01:12:04,541 --> 01:12:08,050
you have like a really
obvious reaction where,

2237
01:12:08,051 --> 01:12:08,531
you know,

2238
01:12:08,531 --> 01:12:09,730
you're very aware that,

2239
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:10,870
okay this is,

2240
01:12:10,871 --> 01:12:13,390
this is what needs to be done
and I need to do this right away.

2241
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:14,210
Yeah.

2242
01:12:14,210 --> 01:12:15,030
But it does happen.

2243
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:15,310
Yeah.

2244
01:12:15,310 --> 01:12:20,310
And I think one of the more vivid
examples for me was when I was sitting for

2245
01:12:20,381 --> 01:12:22,120
someone who is doing Mtma,

2246
01:12:22,121 --> 01:12:22,990
he was a physician.

2247
01:12:23,470 --> 01:12:25,870
And during the experience,

2248
01:12:25,871 --> 01:12:27,430
his arm became paralyzed,

2249
01:12:28,060 --> 01:12:32,980
completely paralyzed and stop working.

2250
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:34,060
And we were like,

2251
01:12:34,090 --> 01:12:36,430
it's not permanent and it's,

2252
01:12:36,431 --> 01:12:37,570
it's psychosomatic.

2253
01:12:37,571 --> 01:12:38,830
You don't really need to,

2254
01:12:39,070 --> 01:12:39,281
you know,

2255
01:12:39,281 --> 01:12:40,630
we don't need to take you to the hospital.

2256
01:12:40,631 --> 01:12:42,940
And he was a doctor and
his arm was paralyzed.

2257
01:12:42,941 --> 01:12:47,020
And over time he told this story
that lasted a couple of hours.

2258
01:12:47,021 --> 01:12:52,021
But the story was that he as was with his
mother and his siblings at the bedside

2259
01:12:53,231 --> 01:12:55,810
of their father who was dying
and all of this life support.

2260
01:12:55,811 --> 01:12:59,680
And they had this discussion about
whether they should pull the plug or not.

2261
01:13:00,190 --> 01:13:00,670
Um,

2262
01:13:00,670 --> 01:13:03,520
and because he was the doctor
and they decided that they would,

2263
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,280
and so he actually pulled the plug in.

2264
01:13:06,350 --> 01:13:11,070
The complicating thing was that he hated
his father and he wasn't really sure it

2265
01:13:11,071 --> 01:13:15,880
was this his anger at his dad or was
this what his mother really wanted.

2266
01:13:16,150 --> 01:13:21,150
So as he explored this emotionally complex
issue and realized he really didn't

2267
01:13:23,141 --> 01:13:23,681
kill his dad,

2268
01:13:23,681 --> 01:13:26,140
he did what his mother and
his siblings were saying.

2269
01:13:26,141 --> 01:13:26,974
It was humane.

2270
01:13:27,190 --> 01:13:29,020
The feelings started
coming back to his arm.

2271
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:29,651
Wow.

2272
01:13:29,651 --> 01:13:31,390
So that was the arm that pulled the plug?

2273
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:32,350
Yeah.

2274
01:13:32,350 --> 01:13:34,510
Is there a real plug that actually
I thought was can be done,

2275
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:37,680
but you know there depends on it.

2276
01:13:37,690 --> 01:13:38,380
I don't know.

2277
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:39,200
Good,

2278
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:41,590
good for her because like pulling
the plug is the expression.

2279
01:13:41,591 --> 01:13:45,610
But what a fucking stupid if life support
systems were really like you just go

2280
01:13:45,611 --> 01:13:46,910
back there and unplug it.

2281
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:48,830
That's how they shot him on.

2282
01:13:48,831 --> 01:13:49,480
Well we never,

2283
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:52,450
we don't want to kill people
so we don't have an off button.

2284
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:54,670
So you have to just pull the plug.

2285
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:58,880
Like really silly
expression is true today.

2286
01:13:59,050 --> 01:14:02,740
You said something that I thought was
really interesting too where you said that

2287
01:14:02,770 --> 01:14:05,230
in the 1960s you don't think
people were ready for it.

2288
01:14:05,910 --> 01:14:07,350
I think a lot of people were,

2289
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:09,600
I think that the culture wasn't,

2290
01:14:09,930 --> 01:14:12,130
and I think even if you read the

2291
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:13,550
electrical aid acid test,

2292
01:14:14,230 --> 01:14:18,730
you know there there's ways in which
people are damaged and left behind and

2293
01:14:18,790 --> 01:14:21,400
that's something where I felt
they weren't quite ready for that.

2294
01:14:21,401 --> 01:14:22,091
Isn't that the case?

2295
01:14:22,091 --> 01:14:22,690
Always.

2296
01:14:22,690 --> 01:14:24,130
Just with life in general,

2297
01:14:24,131 --> 01:14:26,410
there's always going to be people
that are damaged and left behind.

2298
01:14:26,411 --> 01:14:29,950
Well I think one of the beautiful things
about the marines and the military is

2299
01:14:29,951 --> 01:14:31,420
that they don't leave anybody behind.

2300
01:14:31,630 --> 01:14:35,950
And I think that the site that we should
adopt that should be the psychedelic

2301
01:14:35,951 --> 01:14:37,330
marines in a way,

2302
01:14:37,570 --> 01:14:38,470
don't leave anybody behind.

2303
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:40,300
That's really good advice.

2304
01:14:40,301 --> 01:14:44,920
Except there's some really annoying
people out there and if you get hooked up

2305
01:14:44,921 --> 01:14:46,270
with them and you know,

2306
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:47,380
for whatever reason,

2307
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:49,660
they can't carry their
own weight psychically,

2308
01:14:49,661 --> 01:14:50,471
psychologically,

2309
01:14:50,471 --> 01:14:51,304
emotionally,

2310
01:14:51,340 --> 01:14:52,570
they're really fucking meeting.

2311
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:53,860
If certain point Tom,

2312
01:14:53,861 --> 01:14:54,850
you need to cut,

2313
01:14:55,460 --> 01:14:56,890
need to cut ties,

2314
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:58,660
can't fix the whole world.

2315
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:00,550
I think that's really can't,

2316
01:15:00,551 --> 01:15:00,881
you know,

2317
01:15:00,881 --> 01:15:05,380
you can't and you to tell people
that they can is crazy talk right?

2318
01:15:05,381 --> 01:15:05,551
You,

2319
01:15:05,551 --> 01:15:07,960
there's some people that
are just broken animals,

2320
01:15:08,260 --> 01:15:09,220
you can't fix them.

2321
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:10,210
Um,

2322
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:12,460
unfortunately they are
not you and it's not me,

2323
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:14,390
but we both know people who say,

2324
01:15:14,410 --> 01:15:15,243
you know what,

2325
01:15:15,250 --> 01:15:17,350
if you had like if there was a show,

2326
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:19,600
like a one of those fixed me up shows,

2327
01:15:19,601 --> 01:15:22,750
you know they have those like home
improvement shows or weight loss shows.

2328
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:26,680
If you had a guy who was just a
complete fucking mess and they said,

2329
01:15:26,681 --> 01:15:27,760
just Rick Doblin,

2330
01:15:27,761 --> 01:15:29,140
this is your assignment for this show,

2331
01:15:29,141 --> 01:15:32,490
you're going to take this guy and
elevate his consciousness and,

2332
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:36,160
and just make them a much better person
because he could do it with a complete

2333
01:15:36,161 --> 01:15:36,790
idiot.

2334
01:15:36,790 --> 01:15:41,050
Well I think the beauty of it is that
people have to do part of it themselves

2335
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:42,273
and if they're,

2336
01:15:42,370 --> 01:15:45,820
and they own it and that's where they
become empowered and if they want to fix

2337
01:15:45,821 --> 01:15:50,350
them without them taking the courage
and maybe there's ways you can help them

2338
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:55,680
through drugs or through therapeutic
alliance to have that path in mind.

2339
01:15:57,730 --> 01:15:58,060
Right?

2340
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:01,330
They have to be willing to take
certain kinds of steps forward.

2341
01:16:01,331 --> 01:16:04,990
And so that I think that is the
beauty that we can't heal everybody,

2342
01:16:05,050 --> 01:16:06,400
that they have to heal themselves.

2343
01:16:06,430 --> 01:16:11,430
I think there's also a big danger as a
human being in almost embracing the fact

2344
01:16:12,821 --> 01:16:16,570
that you're not going to improve because
it takes away all the pressure of

2345
01:16:16,571 --> 01:16:19,870
trying to improve all
the self examination.

2346
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:21,310
As soon as you just say,

2347
01:16:21,311 --> 01:16:22,390
I don't give a fuck,

2348
01:16:22,610 --> 01:16:23,020
you know,

2349
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:24,370
I don't give a fuck.

2350
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:25,840
Do you really not give a fuck?

2351
01:16:25,841 --> 01:16:26,830
Or do you,

2352
01:16:27,130 --> 01:16:31,780
is that you're psychic shield to keep
you from examining all the holes in your

2353
01:16:31,781 --> 01:16:32,091
life,

2354
01:16:32,091 --> 01:16:32,530
the game?

2355
01:16:32,530 --> 01:16:34,360
Cause that's more likely the case.

2356
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:37,280
Well we talked about the uh,

2357
01:16:37,390 --> 01:16:39,220
army veteran that committed suicide,

2358
01:16:39,250 --> 01:16:40,300
who wrote that letter.

2359
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:45,360
And one part of that letter was that he
had felt like he would never get better.

2360
01:16:45,510 --> 01:16:46,120
Yeah.

2361
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:49,750
And I just kept thinking if he
could have had an Mtma experience,

2362
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:53,740
would he still have been able to find,

2363
01:16:53,780 --> 01:16:54,613
uh,

2364
01:16:54,980 --> 01:16:57,850
some hope and a reason to live or
would he still have committed suicide?

2365
01:16:57,940 --> 01:16:59,050
And those are the questions.

2366
01:16:59,080 --> 01:16:59,381
There's,

2367
01:16:59,381 --> 01:16:59,701
he,

2368
01:16:59,701 --> 01:17:02,530
he talked about 22 veterans
a day are committing suicide.

2369
01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:04,630
He was dealing with physical pain as well.

2370
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:05,730
I think there was a,

2371
01:17:05,731 --> 01:17:08,530
a bunch of different things and
that's where he was upset at.

2372
01:17:08,531 --> 01:17:09,980
The Dea I think also

2373
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:10,420
add,

2374
01:17:10,420 --> 01:17:10,700
uh,

2375
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:12,830
pain meds and how they
regulated pain meds.

2376
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:17,270
So I think the MTMA actually
in combination with morphine,

2377
01:17:17,271 --> 01:17:18,830
it's been used in dying people,

2378
01:17:19,150 --> 01:17:19,790
um,

2379
01:17:19,790 --> 01:17:21,530
enhances the pain control.

2380
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:26,210
So MTMA has pain relieving qualities
and when you combine it with morphine,

2381
01:17:26,211 --> 01:17:27,044
when people are,

2382
01:17:27,470 --> 01:17:28,040
you know,

2383
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:29,060
in hospice settings,

2384
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:29,894
things like that,

2385
01:17:30,140 --> 01:17:34,640
that you have better pain control and
you don't need as much morphine and you

2386
01:17:34,641 --> 01:17:38,840
start waking people up so that they're
not tranquilized out and you open their

2387
01:17:38,841 --> 01:17:41,240
hearts so that people
can have these beautiful,

2388
01:17:41,270 --> 01:17:41,721
beautiful,

2389
01:17:41,721 --> 01:17:43,760
pretty much pain free experiences.

2390
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:46,070
There's a woman that wrote a book,

2391
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:46,221
uh,

2392
01:17:46,221 --> 01:17:50,540
honor thy daughter about her daughter who
died in the early thirties from cancer

2393
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:54,200
and how she had gone through a series of
psychedelic therapy sessions as she was

2394
01:17:54,201 --> 01:17:55,034
dying with,

2395
01:17:55,110 --> 01:17:55,590
um,

2396
01:17:55,590 --> 01:17:56,930
Mtma and mushrooms,

2397
01:17:57,020 --> 01:17:57,441
Lsd,

2398
01:17:57,441 --> 01:17:58,460
MD may combination,

2399
01:17:58,490 --> 01:18:03,490
but that it really enriched her daughter's
life and she felt she needed to write

2400
01:18:04,371 --> 01:18:04,890
a book about,

2401
01:18:04,890 --> 01:18:06,230
it's to let people know.

2402
01:18:06,231 --> 01:18:08,540
So I think that the use of these drugs,

2403
01:18:08,541 --> 01:18:09,680
when people are in pain,

2404
01:18:09,950 --> 01:18:12,080
it's not just mental pain.

2405
01:18:12,110 --> 01:18:16,280
There's a whole link between mental
pain and physical pain and Mtma actually

2406
01:18:16,281 --> 01:18:18,350
does help in this kind of,

2407
01:18:18,590 --> 01:18:20,480
I see psychedelic medicine,

2408
01:18:20,481 --> 01:18:23,690
psychedelic hospice will be pretty common,

2409
01:18:23,691 --> 01:18:25,340
I think 2030 years from now.

2410
01:18:25,490 --> 01:18:27,280
And we'll look back and think that,

2411
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:28,011
you know,

2412
01:18:28,011 --> 01:18:29,480
it made sense 50 years ago.

2413
01:18:29,670 --> 01:18:29,920
Oh,

2414
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:30,820
it absolutely does.

2415
01:18:30,821 --> 01:18:31,031
I mean,

2416
01:18:31,031 --> 01:18:35,560
I think that's one of the best uses
for them to give people like a,

2417
01:18:35,561 --> 01:18:38,360
I remember Larry Hagman who died a,

2418
01:18:38,430 --> 01:18:40,610
was on CNN and uh,

2419
01:18:40,690 --> 01:18:41,501
died recently.

2420
01:18:41,501 --> 01:18:42,334
Great Guy.

2421
01:18:42,430 --> 01:18:43,130
Uh,

2422
01:18:43,130 --> 01:18:44,110
I never got to meet him,

2423
01:18:44,111 --> 01:18:45,640
but I really loved his interviews.

2424
01:18:45,641 --> 01:18:49,390
He was so candid and
just warm and friendly.

2425
01:18:49,750 --> 01:18:51,760
And he was talking about
the importance of a,

2426
01:18:51,761 --> 01:18:52,720
an acid trip to the,

2427
01:18:52,721 --> 01:18:55,540
had that where it took
away his fear of dying.

2428
01:18:55,570 --> 01:18:55,701
Yeah,

2429
01:18:55,701 --> 01:18:56,381
it was a joy.

2430
01:18:56,381 --> 01:18:57,460
Paccar and CNN.

2431
01:18:57,490 --> 01:18:58,630
That was fantastic.

2432
01:18:58,870 --> 01:19:00,250
It was fantastic interview.

2433
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:03,880
It really was because he wasn't
saying it like he was a Kook.

2434
01:19:03,881 --> 01:19:04,714
He was just,

2435
01:19:05,210 --> 01:19:08,200
is explaining what it
did and why I did that.

2436
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:09,460
And you believe them,

2437
01:19:09,490 --> 01:19:09,821
you know,

2438
01:19:09,821 --> 01:19:10,930
you really did believe him.

2439
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:11,341
Yeah.

2440
01:19:11,341 --> 01:19:16,140
I spent years trying to meet him because
I knew that he had done LSD therapy in

2441
01:19:16,141 --> 01:19:16,771
the 60s.

2442
01:19:16,771 --> 01:19:18,540
And he wrote about it
in his autobiography.

2443
01:19:18,541 --> 01:19:20,730
And My mother in law actually
sent me this message saying,

2444
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:22,950
Larry Hagman has done LSD.

2445
01:19:22,951 --> 01:19:27,180
So then I started trying to find them
and eventually I did meet him and we got

2446
01:19:27,181 --> 01:19:31,380
to be friends and he was a
donor to maps and he wrote this,

2447
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:32,310
um,

2448
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:33,143
he helped us in a lot,

2449
01:19:33,180 --> 01:19:34,140
a lot of different ways,

2450
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:38,880
and he was so human that he would be
from Jr and known all over the world.

2451
01:19:38,881 --> 01:19:39,900
But when you were with him,

2452
01:19:39,930 --> 01:19:41,850
he just was present,

2453
01:19:41,851 --> 01:19:42,391
present,

2454
01:19:42,391 --> 01:19:42,581
and,

2455
01:19:42,581 --> 01:19:43,414
and he wasn't,

2456
01:19:43,650 --> 01:19:43,921
you know,

2457
01:19:43,921 --> 01:19:44,731
ego inflated.

2458
01:19:44,731 --> 01:19:46,620
And he was just a really nice person.

2459
01:19:46,621 --> 01:19:47,440
And,

2460
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:48,273
um,

2461
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:48,990
I felt that,

2462
01:19:48,990 --> 01:19:53,990
that he had this idealism and
this joy from his whole life,

2463
01:19:55,051 --> 01:19:58,890
but he also really valued
his psychedelic experiences,

2464
01:19:58,891 --> 01:20:00,480
his experiences with Mtma,

2465
01:20:00,481 --> 01:20:01,950
it's experiences with marijuana.

2466
01:20:01,951 --> 01:20:06,840
And it was kind of ironic that someone
who was so valued by the culture,

2467
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:07,800
um,

2468
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:09,180
couldn't be open about that,

2469
01:20:09,450 --> 01:20:10,600
that he had to keep that hidden.

2470
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:10,961
Well,

2471
01:20:10,961 --> 01:20:12,520
he did for a long time until,

2472
01:20:12,830 --> 01:20:13,820
until he wrote that book.

2473
01:20:13,860 --> 01:20:14,410
Yeah.

2474
01:20:14,410 --> 01:20:14,651
Yeah.

2475
01:20:14,651 --> 01:20:16,270
The Joy Bihar experience.

2476
01:20:16,271 --> 01:20:18,250
But I think also it's like the,

2477
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:18,820
um,

2478
01:20:18,820 --> 01:20:21,130
the atmosphere for an actor.

2479
01:20:21,490 --> 01:20:23,440
Actors get picked for things.

2480
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:25,420
And if you're very controversial,

2481
01:20:25,421 --> 01:20:25,720
I mean,

2482
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:27,040
for every Charlie Sheen,

2483
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:30,020
and of course we're dealing
with 2013 were Charlie.

2484
01:20:30,050 --> 01:20:31,150
She can get away with being,

2485
01:20:31,151 --> 01:20:31,691
it's crazy.

2486
01:20:31,691 --> 01:20:35,590
Coke snorting whoremonger and
like he just wears it and owns it.

2487
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:40,840
For that to be a thing 20
years ago for an actor,

2488
01:20:40,841 --> 01:20:42,400
it could be a career killer.

2489
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:42,820
Yeah.

2490
01:20:42,820 --> 01:20:44,770
And when he was doing Dallas,

2491
01:20:44,771 --> 01:20:45,071
I mean,

2492
01:20:45,071 --> 01:20:45,221
the,

2493
01:20:45,221 --> 01:20:48,670
the consciousness of
the public's opinion on,

2494
01:20:48,730 --> 01:20:52,510
on psychedelics was very much
different than it is today.

2495
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:52,881
Yeah.

2496
01:20:52,881 --> 01:20:53,121
Well,

2497
01:20:53,121 --> 01:20:53,811
he was,

2498
01:20:53,811 --> 01:20:54,530
um,

2499
01:20:54,530 --> 01:20:59,530
in Dallas when Mtma first became a party
drug and it was used at the stark club

2500
01:21:01,610 --> 01:21:04,730
of which there's a documentary
that sort of the explosion of MDA,

2501
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:08,150
the transformation from
MDA as a secret quiet,

2502
01:21:08,690 --> 01:21:09,440
um,

2503
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:14,440
therapeutic drug used underground isn't
quite right cause it was still legal,

2504
01:21:15,380 --> 01:21:19,220
but it was used in a quiet way for fear
that if it became known it would become

2505
01:21:19,221 --> 01:21:19,700
illegal.

2506
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:24,230
And then in Dallas it started being used
and distributed by different people in

2507
01:21:24,231 --> 01:21:27,080
nightclub settings and go
to Dallas was the place,

2508
01:21:27,081 --> 01:21:27,320
right?

2509
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:31,400
Dallas was the place and
there's a documentary about
the star club and there's

2510
01:21:31,401 --> 01:21:32,870
interviews with Larry Hagman in there.

2511
01:21:33,350 --> 01:21:37,270
And what he's talking about is this
a discussion he had with one of the,

2512
01:21:37,271 --> 01:21:37,670
um,

2513
01:21:37,670 --> 01:21:42,350
police officers in Dallas and they were
saying that Larry had caused them to

2514
01:21:42,351 --> 01:21:43,760
lose lots and lots of money.

2515
01:21:44,450 --> 01:21:44,961
And he's like,

2516
01:21:44,961 --> 01:21:45,111
well,

2517
01:21:45,111 --> 01:21:47,240
what do you mean I cause you
to lose lots and lots of money?

2518
01:21:47,241 --> 01:21:47,481
He said,

2519
01:21:47,481 --> 01:21:48,050
well,

2520
01:21:48,050 --> 01:21:49,730
after MD may became illegal,

2521
01:21:49,731 --> 01:21:54,140
we were going to bust the star club
and we had this whole tactical team and

2522
01:21:54,141 --> 01:21:55,040
everything was set to go.

2523
01:21:55,041 --> 01:21:56,840
And then you and some friends came in.

2524
01:21:57,690 --> 01:21:58,221
It's a party.

2525
01:21:58,221 --> 01:22:03,221
They're not necessarily to take MTMA and
so we didn't want to bust Larry Hagman

2526
01:22:03,681 --> 01:22:04,550
from Dallas.

2527
01:22:04,580 --> 01:22:05,470
That's a land.

2528
01:22:05,471 --> 01:22:08,600
So we had to call off the bus and
then come back and do it another time.

2529
01:22:08,930 --> 01:22:09,763
One more time.

2530
01:22:09,890 --> 01:22:13,730
More and more rather evidence at times
have changed because today there'd be

2531
01:22:13,731 --> 01:22:15,410
psyched to bus Larry Hagman,

2532
01:22:15,690 --> 01:22:15,981
you know,

2533
01:22:15,981 --> 01:22:17,570
if was like some dude like that,

2534
01:22:17,571 --> 01:22:19,260
like don't make it Larry Hagman making,

2535
01:22:19,510 --> 01:22:21,560
I know some other female star,

2536
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:23,800
he didn't necessarily have anything
that they could bust him on,

2537
01:22:23,801 --> 01:22:24,970
but he was so nice.

2538
01:22:24,971 --> 01:22:27,520
He led us to auction
off a dinner with him,

2539
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:28,721
uh,

2540
01:22:28,721 --> 01:22:31,000
as a donation to maps and this couple,

2541
01:22:31,001 --> 01:22:31,834
and also Andy,

2542
01:22:32,110 --> 01:22:33,250
Andy Weil did that too.

2543
01:22:33,251 --> 01:22:34,120
So we had a dinner,

2544
01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:34,780
but that,

2545
01:22:34,780 --> 01:22:37,520
the deal they made is I
had to come a long Ah,

2546
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:38,111
and I was like,

2547
01:22:38,111 --> 01:22:39,730
that would be great to do that.

2548
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:41,110
Why would a great dinner.

2549
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:42,110
Yeah.

2550
01:22:42,110 --> 01:22:43,060
Who'd you guys eat dinner with?

2551
01:22:43,390 --> 01:22:44,223
This group,

2552
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:46,000
this family from Canada.

2553
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:47,590
And they,

2554
01:22:47,650 --> 01:22:49,330
they were just ordinary people,

2555
01:22:49,331 --> 01:22:50,770
but they had one of them.

2556
01:22:50,771 --> 01:22:53,380
The woman had struggled
with cancer had they were,

2557
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:54,793
um,

2558
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:59,870
just love Dallas and loved
I dream of Jeannie and hold.

2559
01:22:59,871 --> 01:23:00,311
That's right.

2560
01:23:00,311 --> 01:23:01,540
He was on I dream of Jeannie.

2561
01:23:01,930 --> 01:23:02,260
Yeah.

2562
01:23:02,260 --> 01:23:04,390
And we had such a nice time at the dinner.

2563
01:23:04,391 --> 01:23:05,224
They also,

2564
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:06,580
the dinner with Andy Weil,

2565
01:23:06,970 --> 01:23:07,421
who was he?

2566
01:23:07,421 --> 01:23:08,760
The boss on I Janie,

2567
01:23:08,761 --> 01:23:09,220
Janie.

2568
01:23:09,220 --> 01:23:10,570
And now he was the astronauts.

2569
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:10,921
That's true.

2570
01:23:10,921 --> 01:23:11,470
It's the other guy.

2571
01:23:11,470 --> 01:23:12,490
He was the main character.

2572
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:14,560
Very in love with Barbara Eden.

2573
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:15,580
That's right.

2574
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:16,533
Yeah.

2575
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:18,910
I always get them confused with bewitched.

2576
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:19,661
I get,

2577
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:22,360
I dream of Jeannie and
bewitched confused there.

2578
01:23:22,361 --> 01:23:23,170
There he is.

2579
01:23:23,170 --> 01:23:24,003
Wow.

2580
01:23:24,210 --> 01:23:24,430
B,

2581
01:23:24,430 --> 01:23:27,100
which was the one where
they had a different dude,

2582
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:30,520
like they killed off the
dude and brought in the same,

2583
01:23:30,521 --> 01:23:30,860
yes.

2584
01:23:30,860 --> 01:23:31,211
Yes.

2585
01:23:31,211 --> 01:23:32,260
That was same name,

2586
01:23:32,261 --> 01:23:33,100
different guy.

2587
01:23:33,130 --> 01:23:35,650
I think now that Larry is the gun,

2588
01:23:35,651 --> 01:23:36,580
I can share that.

2589
01:23:36,581 --> 01:23:37,414
Um,

2590
01:23:37,780 --> 01:23:42,040
he had a bond that was made like
the bottle that she lived in.

2591
01:23:42,370 --> 01:23:43,203
Oh,

2592
01:23:45,620 --> 01:23:46,910
that'd be worth a long weekend.

2593
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:51,730
And we got to smoke pot together in
this genie genie bottle and he said that

2594
01:23:51,731 --> 01:23:55,060
somebody had talked to him about marketing
it and making lots of them and he

2595
01:23:55,061 --> 01:23:55,301
said,

2596
01:23:55,301 --> 01:23:55,541
no,

2597
01:23:55,541 --> 01:23:56,950
he didn't want to have that done.

2598
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:57,993
Yeah,

2599
01:23:58,090 --> 01:23:58,871
that's too bad.

2600
01:23:58,871 --> 01:23:59,651
We're going to make it now.

2601
01:23:59,651 --> 01:24:01,030
But sorry.

2602
01:24:01,390 --> 01:24:02,770
But then the family,

2603
01:24:02,771 --> 01:24:04,910
he was so nice with this family and just,

2604
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:07,270
and also with me just treat us as like,

2605
01:24:07,780 --> 01:24:08,560
you know,

2606
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:09,341
part of his family.

2607
01:24:09,341 --> 01:24:13,660
We had dinners kitchen that when it
came time for the dinner with Andy,

2608
01:24:13,661 --> 01:24:18,661
while that the family invited Larry and
he came with a friend of his to help

2609
01:24:22,331 --> 01:24:26,740
them travel and we ended up just
a few months before he died,

2610
01:24:26,830 --> 01:24:27,280
um,

2611
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:31,660
going up and see planes and stuff onto
this island where Andy Weil lives and

2612
01:24:31,661 --> 01:24:34,480
having this really wonderful experience.

2613
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:35,433
That's awesome.

2614
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:36,190
Yeah.

2615
01:24:36,190 --> 01:24:36,551
Yeah.

2616
01:24:36,551 --> 01:24:40,690
I think guys like him that
do those sorts of interviews,

2617
01:24:41,030 --> 01:24:42,280
that's a really,

2618
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:47,460
really important thing because
the public's perception
of people who do LSD is

2619
01:24:48,130 --> 01:24:50,850
almost entirely limited
to fuck ups and you know,

2620
01:24:50,910 --> 01:24:53,140
and crazy people and wild people.

2621
01:24:53,180 --> 01:24:55,120
Or they used to do acid.

2622
01:24:55,420 --> 01:24:55,661
Oh,

2623
01:24:55,661 --> 01:24:56,950
this guy used to do acid,

2624
01:24:56,951 --> 01:24:59,890
he did acid back off his rocker.

2625
01:25:00,190 --> 01:25:01,870
You never hear about it.

2626
01:25:01,871 --> 01:25:05,290
Positive drug experience like
that from a very respected person.

2627
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:05,951
Right.

2628
01:25:05,951 --> 01:25:09,970
And that's what we need is the coming
out of loads of people like that who are

2629
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:11,570
retiring baby boomers.

2630
01:25:11,571 --> 01:25:13,240
So I think time is on our side.

2631
01:25:13,241 --> 01:25:17,050
There's all these people who are more
fearless because they're not worried about

2632
01:25:17,051 --> 01:25:19,240
what they tell their kids or they're
not worried about their jobs.

2633
01:25:19,241 --> 01:25:22,360
They've made a reputation and
they can talk like Steve Jobs.

2634
01:25:22,420 --> 01:25:24,730
I had a wonderful opportunity,

2635
01:25:24,850 --> 01:25:28,630
I tried for years and finally managed to
have a half hour conversation with him

2636
01:25:28,631 --> 01:25:30,160
about our LSD study.

2637
01:25:30,190 --> 01:25:32,740
Did he give you like a half
an hour on an iPhone and go,

2638
01:25:32,741 --> 01:25:34,290
ready press star.

2639
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:35,140
Is it facetime?

2640
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:36,700
Cause Start 29,

2641
01:25:36,701 --> 01:25:39,370
28 before I had an iPhone.

2642
01:25:39,820 --> 01:25:40,510
And uh,

2643
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:41,800
you didn't have an
iPhone when you met him.

2644
01:25:41,801 --> 01:25:42,431
How dare you.

2645
01:25:42,431 --> 01:25:43,091
And I didn't meet him.

2646
01:25:43,091 --> 01:25:44,350
It was just on the fun.

2647
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:45,273
And um,

2648
01:25:45,730 --> 01:25:47,350
at the end of it he said,

2649
01:25:47,410 --> 01:25:47,681
you know,

2650
01:25:47,681 --> 01:25:48,880
send me a proposal.

2651
01:25:48,940 --> 01:25:49,773
But um,

2652
01:25:49,870 --> 01:25:51,220
I didn't never heard back.

2653
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:53,470
He wasn't known for being philanthropic,

2654
01:25:53,471 --> 01:25:56,110
but I had gotten a letter
from Albert Hoffman to him,

2655
01:25:56,690 --> 01:25:57,370
um,

2656
01:25:57,370 --> 01:25:57,881
on his,

2657
01:25:57,881 --> 01:25:58,714
um,

2658
01:25:59,590 --> 01:26:01,210
after it 102nd birthday.

2659
01:26:01,350 --> 01:26:01,780
Wow.

2660
01:26:01,780 --> 01:26:02,021
And,

2661
01:26:02,021 --> 01:26:02,440
um,

2662
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:04,040
I'll say acid lives to be one or

2663
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:04,873
two.

2664
01:26:05,950 --> 01:26:07,790
And he was married for over 70 years.

2665
01:26:07,820 --> 01:26:08,780
The same person.

2666
01:26:09,450 --> 01:26:09,890
Um,

2667
01:26:09,890 --> 01:26:10,400
he led,

2668
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:10,641
I mean,

2669
01:26:10,641 --> 01:26:15,350
Albert Hoffman to pivot just for a
second was such a perfect example.

2670
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:19,490
We're so fortunate that he's the
one that invented LSD because he was

2671
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:20,661
everything.

2672
01:26:20,661 --> 01:26:22,550
What I'm trying to talk about
in terms of integrating,

2673
01:26:22,551 --> 01:26:25,790
he was a big successful chemist
for a major pharmaceutical company.

2674
01:26:26,150 --> 01:26:26,781
Sandoz.

2675
01:26:26,781 --> 01:26:27,561
He made drugs.

2676
01:26:27,561 --> 01:26:29,000
It's sold hundreds of millions of dollars.

2677
01:26:29,001 --> 01:26:30,890
He lived in more or less
than the same place.

2678
01:26:30,891 --> 01:26:33,200
He had a wife for over 70 years.

2679
01:26:33,201 --> 01:26:34,070
He had children,

2680
01:26:34,071 --> 01:26:34,880
very normal,

2681
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:38,150
very normal guy with
his wife up pink dragon.

2682
01:26:39,990 --> 01:26:40,823
Um,

2683
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:41,541
we,

2684
01:26:41,541 --> 01:26:45,320
I was fortunately able to be with the
Albert when they tried to MDA for the

2685
01:26:45,321 --> 01:26:46,154
first time.

2686
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:47,920
How old was in the drive?

2687
01:26:47,930 --> 01:26:49,130
It's they soon as 80s

2688
01:26:51,290 --> 01:26:52,550
or late seventies.

2689
01:26:52,610 --> 01:26:53,390
Um,

2690
01:26:53,390 --> 01:26:55,340
and so what he said was,

2691
01:26:55,370 --> 01:26:56,203
um,

2692
01:26:56,720 --> 01:26:57,110
ah,

2693
01:26:57,110 --> 01:27:02,030
finally something I can do with my wife
because she had had kind of a scary

2694
01:27:02,031 --> 01:27:03,890
experience with Lsd.

2695
01:27:04,290 --> 01:27:05,150
A lot of people have,

2696
01:27:05,151 --> 01:27:05,860
man.

2697
01:27:05,860 --> 01:27:06,290
Yeah.

2698
01:27:06,290 --> 01:27:08,390
Have you done any tests
with like candy flipping,

2699
01:27:08,391 --> 01:27:09,224
like mixing,

2700
01:27:09,380 --> 01:27:10,490
you know,

2701
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:11,540
acid?

2702
01:27:11,540 --> 01:27:11,980
Well,

2703
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:16,980
I believe that that actually has
incredible therapeutic potential.

2704
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:17,450
Um,

2705
01:27:17,450 --> 01:27:22,450
however we've not actually tested it
because in the scientific world you want

2706
01:27:22,581 --> 01:27:25,040
just one variable if possible.

2707
01:27:25,070 --> 01:27:27,530
And so to combine LSD and Mtma,

2708
01:27:27,650 --> 01:27:31,490
which drug are we trying to make a
medicine and are always going to combine

2709
01:27:31,491 --> 01:27:31,731
them,

2710
01:27:31,731 --> 01:27:32,750
but I honestly,

2711
01:27:32,770 --> 01:27:33,890
it becomes legal.

2712
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:37,160
That would be I think maybe even before,

2713
01:27:37,220 --> 01:27:37,521
well,

2714
01:27:37,521 --> 01:27:38,420
that's the question.

2715
01:27:38,450 --> 01:27:38,870
You know,

2716
01:27:38,870 --> 01:27:43,870
it maybe it's 10 years before these
drugs can become medicalized legal in a

2717
01:27:43,911 --> 01:27:44,430
medical way.

2718
01:27:44,430 --> 01:27:45,620
I think that that long,

2719
01:27:46,170 --> 01:27:46,481
um,

2720
01:27:46,481 --> 01:27:46,960
I,

2721
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:48,170
you really think it could be sooner.

2722
01:27:48,620 --> 01:27:50,420
I think that's possible
now more than ever.

2723
01:27:51,380 --> 01:27:55,250
There's a certain track of data that
you have to produce a certain set of

2724
01:27:55,251 --> 01:27:58,400
requirements that were
on the track of doing.

2725
01:27:58,401 --> 01:28:01,040
But it looks to me like
it's eight to 10 years,

2726
01:28:01,070 --> 01:28:02,060
even if it was certainly,

2727
01:28:02,061 --> 01:28:02,894
no.

2728
01:28:03,140 --> 01:28:03,530
Well,

2729
01:28:03,530 --> 01:28:05,120
I've always been wrong.

2730
01:28:05,121 --> 01:28:06,200
I've always been wrong.

2731
01:28:06,201 --> 01:28:08,960
And I've always underestimated
how long it takes you more.

2732
01:28:08,961 --> 01:28:09,794
We were talking about earlier

2733
01:28:09,810 --> 01:28:10,560
gay rights.

2734
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:11,490
I think they equate,

2735
01:28:12,130 --> 01:28:14,430
cause when I was a kid,

2736
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:16,200
I remember I was living in San Francisco,

2737
01:28:16,510 --> 01:28:16,830
uh,

2738
01:28:16,830 --> 01:28:18,600
from seven til 11.

2739
01:28:18,601 --> 01:28:19,111
And uh,

2740
01:28:19,111 --> 01:28:21,600
it was around a lot of gay people and uh,

2741
01:28:21,630 --> 01:28:24,420
it was completely normal because
that was just what I was around.

2742
01:28:24,630 --> 01:28:26,610
And then when I moved to Florida,

2743
01:28:26,611 --> 01:28:27,510
when I was 11,

2744
01:28:27,780 --> 01:28:30,960
my friend candy is
Candido is or Cuban kid,

2745
01:28:31,260 --> 01:28:34,700
his dad was really pissed
off with the newspaper,

2746
01:28:34,710 --> 01:28:36,630
slams it down and he was,

2747
01:28:36,690 --> 01:28:37,710
he was mad that,

2748
01:28:37,711 --> 01:28:38,050
uh,

2749
01:28:38,050 --> 01:28:38,321
the,

2750
01:28:38,321 --> 01:28:39,870
the fags wanted to get married.

2751
01:28:39,930 --> 01:28:40,830
That's what he kept saying,

2752
01:28:41,210 --> 01:28:41,941
I believe this shit,

2753
01:28:41,941 --> 01:28:43,050
these fags want to get married.

2754
01:28:43,350 --> 01:28:44,640
And then I remember I was like 11.

2755
01:28:44,641 --> 01:28:45,001
I was like,

2756
01:28:45,001 --> 01:28:45,301
what?

2757
01:28:45,301 --> 01:28:46,170
Why do you care?

2758
01:28:46,190 --> 01:28:46,920
Like,

2759
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:47,101
well,

2760
01:28:47,101 --> 01:28:48,120
you're a grown man.

2761
01:28:48,121 --> 01:28:48,721
Like this is what,

2762
01:28:48,721 --> 01:28:50,180
how stupid some grown manner.

2763
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:50,881
And I was like,

2764
01:28:50,881 --> 01:28:52,350
that's a weird argument.

2765
01:28:52,351 --> 01:28:53,670
Like that's a strange thing.

2766
01:28:53,940 --> 01:28:55,380
So that was,

2767
01:28:55,540 --> 01:28:56,190
you know,

2768
01:28:56,190 --> 01:28:57,240
a long ass time ago.

2769
01:28:57,241 --> 01:28:58,230
I'm 45 years old now,

2770
01:28:58,231 --> 01:29:00,870
so I was 34 years ago and um,

2771
01:29:01,380 --> 01:29:01,621
the,

2772
01:29:01,621 --> 01:29:02,520
I know it's not,

2773
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:04,170
yeah,

2774
01:29:04,170 --> 01:29:04,750
it is.

2775
01:29:04,750 --> 01:29:05,400
Okay.

2776
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:10,230
But it's the idea that
that back then it was,

2777
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:12,720
it was really something
that people fought against.

2778
01:29:12,930 --> 01:29:14,030
It was really a,

2779
01:29:14,050 --> 01:29:16,290
a subject of you could,

2780
01:29:16,291 --> 01:29:20,250
you could be public about it and
not feel like an ignorant asshole.

2781
01:29:20,430 --> 01:29:24,300
Whereas today if you say that you're
against gay people being married,

2782
01:29:24,301 --> 01:29:25,830
like you're nothing but a fool,

2783
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:26,220
right?

2784
01:29:26,220 --> 01:29:27,330
You're nothing but a full,

2785
01:29:27,450 --> 01:29:27,910
if you,

2786
01:29:27,910 --> 01:29:28,181
you,

2787
01:29:28,181 --> 01:29:32,370
you honestly think it's either you're
crazy with religion and you honestly

2788
01:29:32,371 --> 01:29:33,780
thanked that somehow or another,

2789
01:29:33,781 --> 01:29:37,170
it's possible to cure person of being gay.

2790
01:29:37,171 --> 01:29:39,480
And if they believe in
the scripture that's,

2791
01:29:39,481 --> 01:29:40,070
you know,

2792
01:29:40,070 --> 01:29:41,850
that I can't even talk to you.

2793
01:29:42,390 --> 01:29:42,900
That's,

2794
01:29:42,900 --> 01:29:43,950
that's a different animal.

2795
01:29:44,010 --> 01:29:47,910
But if you're a rational person and you
accept the fact that people were born

2796
01:29:47,911 --> 01:29:49,590
gang and you,

2797
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:51,900
you have an issue with
them marrying their lover,

2798
01:29:51,930 --> 01:29:53,100
like you're a crazy person.

2799
01:29:53,390 --> 01:29:53,690
Yeah.

2800
01:29:53,690 --> 01:29:56,780
I think though that
people who are irrational,

2801
01:29:56,781 --> 01:29:57,161
they're there.

2802
01:29:57,161 --> 01:29:58,250
That's the question.

2803
01:29:58,251 --> 01:30:00,810
How do we rationalize the ration?

2804
01:30:00,830 --> 01:30:04,790
I think there's a way that they're
fearful of something that blocks their

2805
01:30:04,791 --> 01:30:08,300
rational thinking and if you
can somehow or other help them.

2806
01:30:08,301 --> 01:30:11,960
And I think a lot of people who are so
anti gay are scared of their own gay

2807
01:30:11,961 --> 01:30:12,381
feelings.

2808
01:30:12,381 --> 01:30:13,280
It's kind of a cliche,

2809
01:30:13,281 --> 01:30:15,410
but I think that's often the case.

2810
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:20,440
But I think what drove me early on into
an interest in psychedelics is that I

2811
01:30:21,801 --> 01:30:26,801
was so terrified of World War II and
the Holocaust and how people can be so

2812
01:30:27,561 --> 01:30:32,561
blind or be willing to be so driven
by irrational factors that I thought,

2813
01:30:32,961 --> 01:30:37,460
what can we do to try to
help get to heal that?

2814
01:30:37,730 --> 01:30:39,530
Because some people,

2815
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:39,911
you know,

2816
01:30:39,911 --> 01:30:40,090
they,

2817
01:30:40,090 --> 01:30:43,190
they can be quite powerful and they can,

2818
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:44,090
um,

2819
01:30:44,090 --> 01:30:45,730
how do you respond?

2820
01:30:45,790 --> 01:30:46,251
And that,

2821
01:30:46,251 --> 01:30:47,660
that was the dilemma for me.

2822
01:30:47,661 --> 01:30:48,890
And I finally felt that,

2823
01:30:49,290 --> 01:30:49,880
um,

2824
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:51,530
growing up with the Vietnam war,

2825
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:55,280
that that was something that now I was
being called to fight and I decided to

2826
01:30:55,281 --> 01:30:56,660
become a draft resistor.

2827
01:30:57,290 --> 01:31:02,290
But I saw the nuclear standoff between
the U S in Russia and it just seemed like

2828
01:31:03,410 --> 01:31:06,890
the irrational was so powerful.

2829
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:08,660
The demonization of the other.

2830
01:31:08,661 --> 01:31:11,510
And the making of the
enemy that there was,

2831
01:31:12,710 --> 01:31:14,030
I couldn't figure out how to uh,

2832
01:31:14,060 --> 01:31:16,490
contribute to breaking through that cycle.

2833
01:31:16,491 --> 01:31:17,930
And it finally felt like this,

2834
01:31:18,350 --> 01:31:19,183
um,

2835
01:31:20,750 --> 01:31:24,650
deep spiritual experience of connection
and letting people's fears come up where

2836
01:31:24,651 --> 01:31:25,910
they could look at them more.

2837
01:31:25,940 --> 01:31:30,940
That that would be for an individual make
us more grounded and less likely to be

2838
01:31:31,401 --> 01:31:33,320
manipulated are irrational factors.

2839
01:31:33,321 --> 01:31:36,320
And if millions of people
could have that experience,

2840
01:31:36,321 --> 01:31:37,850
which did happen during the 60s,

2841
01:31:37,851 --> 01:31:39,110
but if we can expand it,

2842
01:31:39,530 --> 01:31:44,530
that maybe there is a basis to go through
the crises that we're facing over the

2843
01:31:44,690 --> 01:31:48,290
next couple of decades as a species and
as globalization and people are bumping

2844
01:31:48,291 --> 01:31:53,291
up against each other that it felt like
somehow or other the irrational is based

2845
01:31:54,291 --> 01:31:58,460
a lot on fear and how can we help
people to counter that with love,

2846
01:31:58,461 --> 01:32:02,020
with hope or with looking
with self acceptance.

2847
01:32:02,020 --> 01:32:06,640
And I think that's where the MTMA is so
useful that the fear of self criticism

2848
01:32:06,641 --> 01:32:11,641
or the fear that Mtma helps people to
accept who they are and the LSD and the

2849
01:32:12,671 --> 01:32:13,451
silicide bend,

2850
01:32:13,451 --> 01:32:14,320
the Iowasca,

2851
01:32:14,321 --> 01:32:15,100
the masculine,

2852
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:15,933
the Payoti,

2853
01:32:16,210 --> 01:32:16,631
those,

2854
01:32:16,631 --> 01:32:17,464
the drugs,

2855
01:32:17,860 --> 01:32:20,380
they are challenging in a different way.

2856
01:32:20,410 --> 01:32:25,410
And that they do this dissolving of the
control mechanisms and dissolving of the

2857
01:32:26,471 --> 01:32:27,250
ego and,

2858
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:31,660
and hopefully people can let go and
blend and be strengthened from that.

2859
01:32:32,200 --> 01:32:36,280
And that's the support that we need to
provide to help that to be happening.

2860
01:32:36,281 --> 01:32:37,114
And I think,

2861
01:32:37,270 --> 01:32:37,990
you know,

2862
01:32:37,990 --> 01:32:41,440
just the way that this religious
fundamentalism against gay marriage,

2863
01:32:41,470 --> 01:32:41,830
I mean,

2864
01:32:41,830 --> 01:32:45,670
right now we have a crisis of
fundamentalism around the world.

2865
01:32:45,780 --> 01:32:47,230
There's a crisis of ideology.

2866
01:32:47,290 --> 01:32:47,740
Yeah.

2867
01:32:47,740 --> 01:32:48,050
So,

2868
01:32:48,050 --> 01:32:52,750
and it's also a crisis of power because
once someone gets into a position where

2869
01:32:52,751 --> 01:32:54,310
they can espouse their ideology,

2870
01:32:54,311 --> 01:32:55,091
you listen to them,

2871
01:32:55,091 --> 01:32:55,930
that is power.

2872
01:32:56,230 --> 01:32:58,330
And then they use that power to get money,

2873
01:32:58,331 --> 01:32:58,931
to manipulate,

2874
01:32:58,931 --> 01:32:59,651
to get sex,

2875
01:32:59,651 --> 01:33:01,960
to do whatever the fuck
they want and not pay taxes.

2876
01:33:02,260 --> 01:33:03,580
There's a lot of craziness.

2877
01:33:03,581 --> 01:33:05,290
It's almost like in and
not pay taxes thing.

2878
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:07,300
It's almost like they're in cahoots.

2879
01:33:07,330 --> 01:33:08,740
It's like the government has decided,

2880
01:33:08,741 --> 01:33:08,951
look,

2881
01:33:08,951 --> 01:33:12,340
it'd probably be beneficial if you
guys did a good job and you know,

2882
01:33:12,341 --> 01:33:15,640
cult it up the shit out of some people
and get them all whacked out on your

2883
01:33:15,641 --> 01:33:20,050
ideas to the point where they're
complete fundamentalists on your idea.

2884
01:33:20,051 --> 01:33:22,030
So how about you not paid taxes?

2885
01:33:22,430 --> 01:33:22,751
You know,

2886
01:33:22,751 --> 01:33:24,130
how about we help you along there,

2887
01:33:24,160 --> 01:33:24,401
you know,

2888
01:33:24,401 --> 01:33:25,840
make it even more profitable,

2889
01:33:25,841 --> 01:33:28,960
more susceptible to corruption?

2890
01:33:29,830 --> 01:33:30,101
Well,

2891
01:33:30,101 --> 01:33:31,240
I think that there,

2892
01:33:31,241 --> 01:33:32,310
there is that,

2893
01:33:32,311 --> 01:33:33,144
um,

2894
01:33:33,850 --> 01:33:36,640
way in which the government
can be influenced by groups.

2895
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:37,180
Sure.

2896
01:33:37,180 --> 01:33:41,500
And I think that's something also
that we have to be wary of some mess,

2897
01:33:41,740 --> 01:33:45,160
but at the same time we have
to work through groups and
work through government.

2898
01:33:45,161 --> 01:33:45,994
So I think this,

2899
01:33:46,250 --> 01:33:46,840
um,

2900
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:49,330
one of the first things we learned
at the Kennedy School is there is no,

2901
01:33:49,331 --> 01:33:50,160
the government,

2902
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:50,970
it's like your body,

2903
01:33:50,970 --> 01:33:51,341
there is no,

2904
01:33:51,341 --> 01:33:51,821
your body,

2905
01:33:51,821 --> 01:33:53,260
there's all these different organ systems.

2906
01:33:53,261 --> 01:33:54,790
They all work in different ways.

2907
01:33:54,791 --> 01:33:57,460
So we find out about that when
the government goes after itself.

2908
01:33:57,880 --> 01:33:58,700
Like when,

2909
01:33:58,700 --> 01:34:00,640
when this general Patraeus thing happened,

2910
01:34:00,641 --> 01:34:04,270
we found out the CIA and the FBI
don't necessarily see eye to eye.

2911
01:34:04,420 --> 01:34:05,060
Right.

2912
01:34:05,060 --> 01:34:05,450
You know?

2913
01:34:05,450 --> 01:34:05,770
Right.

2914
01:34:05,770 --> 01:34:07,480
And that's where our strategy is built at.

2915
01:34:07,481 --> 01:34:12,340
The FDA is putting science over politics
while the other forces are trying to

2916
01:34:13,090 --> 01:34:14,590
either slow down or black research.

2917
01:34:14,590 --> 01:34:19,000
And where it comes with marijuana is
that there's a government monopoly on the

2918
01:34:19,001 --> 01:34:22,480
supply of marijuana that can
be used in federal research.

2919
01:34:22,481 --> 01:34:25,540
So even though there is no
monopoly on the supply marijuana,

2920
01:34:26,230 --> 01:34:31,230
the only kind that's been grown under
DEA license is controlled by the national

2921
01:34:31,361 --> 01:34:32,320
institute on Drug Abuse.

2922
01:34:32,350 --> 01:34:33,220
And it's hilarious.

2923
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:37,720
You want to get to do research to
make marijuana into a medicine.

2924
01:34:37,721 --> 01:34:39,490
The FDA will give you permission.

2925
01:34:39,491 --> 01:34:43,740
We have a permission to do a study
with marijuana in 50 veterans for post

2926
01:34:43,741 --> 01:34:44,980
traumatic stress disorder.

2927
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:50,500
And our distinction is that the marijuana
is more about treating symptoms and

2928
01:34:50,501 --> 01:34:53,170
the Mtma is more about curing is getting.

2929
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:57,050
And then you only need Mtma a few times
with the marijuana people sort of need

2930
01:34:57,110 --> 01:34:57,620
every day.

2931
01:34:57,620 --> 01:34:58,250
Yeah.

2932
01:34:58,250 --> 01:35:03,170
But we have FDA approval and Nada and
the Public Health Service rejected the

2933
01:35:03,171 --> 01:35:05,840
protocol and refused to
provide the marijuana for us.

2934
01:35:05,841 --> 01:35:10,841
And they only can review protocols for
marijuana because they've got sitting on

2935
01:35:11,001 --> 01:35:14,090
this monopoly and we were 12
years lawsuit and we won and won.

2936
01:35:14,091 --> 01:35:18,020
And then we lost in the first circuit
court of appeals to break the monopoly.

2937
01:35:18,290 --> 01:35:23,120
But that's the core reason why we're
not able to make progress with marijuana

2938
01:35:23,121 --> 01:35:25,880
research and we are able to
make progress with psychedelics.

2939
01:35:25,881 --> 01:35:27,410
And are they afraid of with marijuana?

2940
01:35:27,710 --> 01:35:30,650
I think they're afraid of the
whole drug war collapsing,

2941
01:35:30,770 --> 01:35:35,450
that the marijuana is
incredibly demonized.

2942
01:35:35,451 --> 01:35:37,430
It's widely used most.

2943
01:35:37,460 --> 01:35:40,730
There's a lot of people that
know that it's not so dangerous.

2944
01:35:40,731 --> 01:35:41,690
And I think it's the,

2945
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:42,860
it's a symbol,

2946
01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:45,320
it's a symbol of cultural rebellion.

2947
01:35:45,380 --> 01:35:49,400
And that's where it was embedded
in certain people's minds.

2948
01:35:49,401 --> 01:35:53,600
And even though it was made illegal
in 37 with the marijuana tax act,

2949
01:35:53,630 --> 01:35:56,570
then it was illegal shortly
after prohibition ended.

2950
01:35:57,140 --> 01:36:01,430
And it was illegal during the depression
and mostly it was Mexicans and blacks

2951
01:36:01,431 --> 01:36:02,264
that smoked pot.

2952
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:06,230
And so it was a way to repress people
who are competing for low wage jobs.

2953
01:36:06,590 --> 01:36:08,630
It was a way to block the hemp industry,

2954
01:36:09,140 --> 01:36:10,190
various things like that.

2955
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:10,910
But,

2956
01:36:10,910 --> 01:36:15,910
but it largely was a minor thread in
American history until the 60s and white

2957
01:36:16,341 --> 01:36:17,360
suburban people started,

2958
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:21,950
kids started smoking pot and you had this
massive explosion of pot and then pot

2959
01:36:21,951 --> 01:36:25,130
and LSD got associated
with cultural rebellion.

2960
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:28,310
And now all these years later,

2961
01:36:28,790 --> 01:36:29,061
you know,

2962
01:36:29,061 --> 01:36:32,870
there are many people that smoke pot
that are at least out about that.

2963
01:36:32,871 --> 01:36:34,360
And it made a lot of contributions.

2964
01:36:34,361 --> 01:36:38,270
So I think it's more now about
fear of parents for their kids.

2965
01:36:38,870 --> 01:36:39,703
It's shifted.

2966
01:36:39,830 --> 01:36:44,830
But that's what's driving what's left
of the drug war is parents wanting to

2967
01:36:44,841 --> 01:36:49,370
protect their kids and also all these
vested interests that have the prison

2968
01:36:49,371 --> 01:36:50,690
unions and things like that.

2969
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:52,033
The,

2970
01:36:52,100 --> 01:36:55,850
but I think that dynamic we're
trying to is shifting also.

2971
01:36:55,910 --> 01:37:00,910
And so there's a way in which those of
us who were interested in enhancing our

2972
01:37:01,131 --> 01:37:02,600
lives with these drugs in positive,

2973
01:37:02,601 --> 01:37:04,850
responsible ways need to do so.

2974
01:37:04,860 --> 01:37:06,050
Need to speak about it,

2975
01:37:06,070 --> 01:37:09,140
where possible and need
to demonstrate that.

2976
01:37:09,141 --> 01:37:10,790
It's not about tearing down the society,

2977
01:37:10,850 --> 01:37:11,630
it's strengthened.

2978
01:37:11,630 --> 01:37:16,040
It's all of us coming together to face
these incredible challenges and we need

2979
01:37:16,041 --> 01:37:19,550
all the inspiration and we need all the
creativity and we need all the energy

2980
01:37:19,551 --> 01:37:20,360
that we can.

2981
01:37:20,360 --> 01:37:23,370
So unfortunately for some people they
really can't speak out about it because

2982
01:37:23,371 --> 01:37:25,020
they get drug tested at work.

2983
01:37:25,290 --> 01:37:26,190
That's a big issue.

2984
01:37:26,191 --> 01:37:26,840
I mean the,

2985
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:27,061
the,

2986
01:37:27,061 --> 01:37:27,200
the,

2987
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:27,381
the,

2988
01:37:27,381 --> 01:37:27,570
the,

2989
01:37:27,570 --> 01:37:30,840
the idea that something that stays
in your body as long as marijuana,

2990
01:37:30,841 --> 01:37:31,651
it gets tested.

2991
01:37:31,651 --> 01:37:33,120
When the psychoactive,

2992
01:37:33,380 --> 01:37:33,621
the,

2993
01:37:33,621 --> 01:37:33,961
the,

2994
01:37:33,961 --> 01:37:34,201
the,

2995
01:37:34,201 --> 01:37:38,220
the time in which your body brings it
back to baselines lines less than 24

2996
01:37:38,221 --> 01:37:38,611
hours,

2997
01:37:38,611 --> 01:37:39,250
right?

2998
01:37:39,250 --> 01:37:40,310
I mean is your,

2999
01:37:40,340 --> 01:37:40,790
your,

3000
01:37:40,790 --> 01:37:42,690
you basically just have
traced metabolites.

3001
01:37:42,691 --> 01:37:44,430
It stays in your system
for a long ass time,

3002
01:37:44,670 --> 01:37:45,870
but they're not psychoactive.

3003
01:37:46,260 --> 01:37:47,100
So you're at work,

3004
01:37:47,101 --> 01:37:47,431
you get it.

3005
01:37:47,431 --> 01:37:48,450
You spoke to join on Friday,

3006
01:37:48,451 --> 01:37:49,201
you're at work on Monday.

3007
01:37:49,201 --> 01:37:50,370
Then like you take a piss test,

3008
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:52,080
you piss positive.

3009
01:37:52,230 --> 01:37:55,530
They're penalizing you for
something you're doing when
you're not at work really

3010
01:37:55,531 --> 01:37:56,010
is not going to

3011
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:56,790
affect work.

3012
01:37:56,790 --> 01:37:59,670
You can also be arrested for
driving under the influence.

3013
01:37:59,940 --> 01:38:00,181
Yeah.

3014
01:38:00,181 --> 01:38:03,030
From metabolites that you
took from pot a week ago.

3015
01:38:03,060 --> 01:38:03,630
Right.

3016
01:38:03,630 --> 01:38:04,860
It's nonsense.

3017
01:38:04,890 --> 01:38:05,880
It's so crazy.

3018
01:38:05,881 --> 01:38:07,080
The idea that that,

3019
01:38:07,530 --> 01:38:08,041
first of all,

3020
01:38:08,041 --> 01:38:08,930
the idea that they treat,

3021
01:38:08,970 --> 01:38:12,990
they have some arbitrary level that
they test you for and they say,

3022
01:38:12,991 --> 01:38:13,621
well this is,

3023
01:38:13,621 --> 01:38:16,710
you can't operate a marijuana vehicle
vehicle on marijuana if you have this

3024
01:38:16,711 --> 01:38:17,544
function or system.

3025
01:38:17,730 --> 01:38:18,570
It's been proven.

3026
01:38:18,780 --> 01:38:20,310
What tests have you done?

3027
01:38:20,490 --> 01:38:20,721
Well,

3028
01:38:20,721 --> 01:38:22,800
where's the science
behind the national level?

3029
01:38:22,801 --> 01:38:24,360
When you look at the science,

3030
01:38:24,690 --> 01:38:26,070
the experience,

3031
01:38:26,071 --> 01:38:31,071
marijuana smokers are not debilitated by
in their driving and there's been a lot

3032
01:38:31,201 --> 01:38:33,000
of driving tests that had been done.

3033
01:38:33,390 --> 01:38:38,130
And what they show is that when you are
drinking alcohol and driving that you

3034
01:38:39,330 --> 01:38:40,081
are impaired,

3035
01:38:40,081 --> 01:38:42,240
but you don't think you're impaired.

3036
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:48,080
And so you were more reckless that under
a marijuana people know that sometimes

3037
01:38:48,541 --> 01:38:49,470
their instincts,

3038
01:38:49,471 --> 01:38:50,940
their reaction time might be slow.

3039
01:38:50,940 --> 01:38:53,280
So you take compensating action.

3040
01:38:53,281 --> 01:38:56,040
So people are more careful when
they're driving and more aware.

3041
01:38:56,041 --> 01:38:57,690
So in driving,

3042
01:38:58,020 --> 01:38:59,010
not in simulators,

3043
01:38:59,011 --> 01:39:03,210
but when they're out in driving roads
and cars that and in simulators to that

3044
01:39:03,420 --> 01:39:04,680
marijuana is very

3045
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:10,500
minimally affecting driving
and you become paranoid.

3046
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:12,490
So you'd drive a little slower and,

3047
01:39:12,580 --> 01:39:14,370
and you react a little slower to,

3048
01:39:14,710 --> 01:39:17,070
and really you think you
react slower physically?

3049
01:39:17,850 --> 01:39:18,121
No,

3050
01:39:18,121 --> 01:39:19,130
I mean by that that,

3051
01:39:19,140 --> 01:39:19,321
no,

3052
01:39:19,321 --> 01:39:22,500
cause I've a lot look at all these
basketball players that you know,

3053
01:39:23,010 --> 01:39:23,800
tied into it.

3054
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:24,301
It's just,

3055
01:39:24,301 --> 01:39:24,481
yeah,

3056
01:39:24,481 --> 01:39:26,340
you didn't know about that Jujitsu.

3057
01:39:26,430 --> 01:39:27,270
I didn't.

3058
01:39:27,330 --> 01:39:28,740
Huge in the Jiu Jitsu community.

3059
01:39:28,860 --> 01:39:30,240
Massive snowboarding.

3060
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:34,530
A massive amount of people
smoke pot and then go train the,

3061
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:35,200
the,

3062
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:35,931
it's so much.

3063
01:39:35,931 --> 01:39:38,700
So they have t shirts rolling all stoned,

3064
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:40,230
rolling stone.

3065
01:39:40,260 --> 01:39:41,370
They have all these different,

3066
01:39:41,371 --> 01:39:41,970
uh,

3067
01:39:41,970 --> 01:39:44,290
I mean it's so common
in the janitor world.

3068
01:39:44,430 --> 01:39:44,710
Yeah.

3069
01:39:44,710 --> 01:39:48,440
I play racquetball and so I
can have combined marijuana,

3070
01:39:48,450 --> 01:39:51,060
racquetball and train myself
to be really quick reacting.

3071
01:39:51,080 --> 01:39:51,750
Yeah.

3072
01:39:51,750 --> 01:39:55,530
And sometimes I play my best games
when I'm stoned and sometimes I don't

3073
01:39:57,510 --> 01:39:59,000
give a fuck and it balls,

3074
01:39:59,020 --> 01:40:02,910
but I can never tell ahead of
time whether it be better or not.

3075
01:40:02,940 --> 01:40:04,050
But that's funny.

3076
01:40:04,260 --> 01:40:06,210
But I think with driving that,

3077
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:07,110
um,

3078
01:40:07,110 --> 01:40:10,590
what I meant by reaction time is that
you don't take precipitous action.

3079
01:40:10,591 --> 01:40:11,950
So the classic thing is that you're,

3080
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:12,631
I'm going somewhere,

3081
01:40:12,631 --> 01:40:13,700
I'm thinking about something I,

3082
01:40:13,910 --> 01:40:15,870
I don't turn where I wanted to turn,

3083
01:40:16,220 --> 01:40:18,400
but then I just like calm way,

3084
01:40:18,401 --> 01:40:19,201
find my way back.

3085
01:40:19,201 --> 01:40:20,250
I don't like jerked the wheel.

3086
01:40:20,600 --> 01:40:23,010
I do want to clarify though,

3087
01:40:23,011 --> 01:40:23,970
that that's you,

3088
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:24,391
you're in a,

3089
01:40:24,391 --> 01:40:27,000
you're an intelligent guy and
you have your shit together.

3090
01:40:27,030 --> 01:40:27,231
Right.

3091
01:40:27,231 --> 01:40:27,600
That's true.

3092
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:29,190
I think for most folks it's,

3093
01:40:30,210 --> 01:40:30,571
you know,

3094
01:40:30,571 --> 01:40:31,740
I don't like driving Tai.

3095
01:40:32,070 --> 01:40:32,490
I don't,

3096
01:40:32,490 --> 01:40:33,690
I'd rather be sober.

3097
01:40:34,230 --> 01:40:35,100
I'd rather be sober.

3098
01:40:35,820 --> 01:40:36,740
I don't like it.

3099
01:40:36,741 --> 01:40:38,730
There's a lot of things that I
don't like to do when I'm high.

3100
01:40:39,190 --> 01:40:40,023
I don't mind it,

3101
01:40:40,250 --> 01:40:43,020
but I want to get pulled over and I'm
high and I got to talk my way out of,

3102
01:40:43,050 --> 01:40:43,291
you know,

3103
01:40:43,291 --> 01:40:45,600
some cop being upset at me for being high,

3104
01:40:45,601 --> 01:40:47,100
like two of them telling
me how to drive fine.

3105
01:40:47,101 --> 01:40:47,934
I'm good.

3106
01:40:47,940 --> 01:40:51,000
I don't want to be involved
in that situation and I don't,

3107
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:51,900
I think I'm,

3108
01:40:51,900 --> 01:40:53,860
I would be kind of a hypocrite if,

3109
01:40:53,861 --> 01:40:54,694
uh,

3110
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:57,420
if I said that and like,

3111
01:40:57,460 --> 01:40:58,010
or if I,

3112
01:40:58,010 --> 01:41:00,400
if I had a problem with some
people getting high and driving,

3113
01:41:00,550 --> 01:41:02,130
but I know some people were impaired.

3114
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:02,990
There's,

3115
01:41:02,990 --> 01:41:03,823
there's,

3116
01:41:04,140 --> 01:41:06,280
there's certain people that
freak out and they get high.

3117
01:41:06,281 --> 01:41:07,510
Even driving when you were impaired.

3118
01:41:07,550 --> 01:41:08,240
Yeah.

3119
01:41:08,240 --> 01:41:09,220
When you freaking out.

3120
01:41:09,310 --> 01:41:11,170
I think even if it's only psychologically,

3121
01:41:11,350 --> 01:41:13,120
even if your reflexes are still there,

3122
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:14,290
you're still impaired,

3123
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:14,960
you know,

3124
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:15,793
your

3125
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:18,640
don't drive like that.

3126
01:41:18,700 --> 01:41:22,480
Please stop sobriety driving.

3127
01:41:22,481 --> 01:41:23,314
I think go hand.

3128
01:41:23,710 --> 01:41:27,610
I did have you talked about being high
and having to talk to a police officer.

3129
01:41:28,090 --> 01:41:28,480
Um,

3130
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:32,530
I was actually going to visit John
Lilly and a chemist friend of mine had

3131
01:41:32,531 --> 01:41:37,531
separated the isomers of ketamine and
I was going to bring that to John who

3132
01:41:37,541 --> 01:41:38,890
hadn't tried the different isomers yet.

3133
01:41:39,350 --> 01:41:39,760
Um,

3134
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:42,370
this is in Florida and
it was way long time ago.

3135
01:41:42,910 --> 01:41:43,743
And uh,

3136
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:44,620
I was,

3137
01:41:44,620 --> 01:41:45,010
um,

3138
01:41:45,010 --> 01:41:46,720
I had a Porsche nine 14,

3139
01:41:46,721 --> 01:41:47,381
which is small,

3140
01:41:47,381 --> 01:41:47,801
cheap car,

3141
01:41:47,801 --> 01:41:48,880
but just says the open top.

3142
01:41:48,900 --> 01:41:51,160
And so I was going from Sarasota,

3143
01:41:51,161 --> 01:41:52,060
Florida to Miami,

3144
01:41:52,540 --> 01:41:56,290
and it was just such a beautiful night
and the moon was out and I was stone.

3145
01:41:56,300 --> 01:41:56,771
And I thought,

3146
01:41:56,771 --> 01:41:56,951
okay,

3147
01:41:56,951 --> 01:41:57,784
I'm going to speed.

3148
01:41:58,180 --> 01:41:59,110
It's just beautiful.

3149
01:41:59,111 --> 01:41:59,950
I'm going to get a ticket,

3150
01:41:59,951 --> 01:42:00,784
but it's okay.

3151
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:01,451
And I thought,

3152
01:42:01,451 --> 01:42:01,691
okay,

3153
01:42:01,691 --> 01:42:03,370
as long as I'm just
going to get this ticket.

3154
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:03,581
Well,

3155
01:42:03,581 --> 01:42:08,410
why don't I just think about what I
could tell the police officer when the

3156
01:42:08,411 --> 01:42:09,640
inevitable happens.

3157
01:42:09,700 --> 01:42:12,950
So you're thinking about this as you're
planning for your ticket as and fire for

3158
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:13,331
it tickets.

3159
01:42:13,331 --> 01:42:13,521
What,

3160
01:42:13,521 --> 01:42:18,520
what can I tell him about that would
somehow or other the bok and I thought the

3161
01:42:18,521 --> 01:42:20,620
first thing is don't
deny that I'm speeding.

3162
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:21,310
You know,

3163
01:42:21,310 --> 01:42:21,730
don't,

3164
01:42:21,730 --> 01:42:23,300
don't contradict an I think,

3165
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:25,750
but the main thing I thought
is what do we have in common?

3166
01:42:26,350 --> 01:42:27,040
You know,

3167
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:30,880
and the only thing I could think of
is we're two guys out in the road.

3168
01:42:30,881 --> 01:42:35,260
I don't fry lonely guys on a
Friday night out in the roads.

3169
01:42:35,261 --> 01:42:37,210
And so none of blow this
car to get out and took it.

3170
01:42:37,211 --> 01:42:39,890
And I'm very,

3171
01:42:40,040 --> 01:42:41,310
you know,

3172
01:42:41,350 --> 01:42:45,650
the story was that I was on my way
to see my girlfriend and I was,

3173
01:42:46,110 --> 01:42:46,943
and that was late.

3174
01:42:47,050 --> 01:42:47,560
Okay.

3175
01:42:47,560 --> 01:42:48,370
And officer,

3176
01:42:48,370 --> 01:42:51,280
I am speeding and I'm sorry,

3177
01:42:51,370 --> 01:42:52,420
but that's what I was doing.

3178
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:54,730
And so it happened.

3179
01:42:54,910 --> 01:42:56,230
I got pulled over,

3180
01:42:56,750 --> 01:42:59,260
I told the story and the guy was like,

3181
01:42:59,680 --> 01:43:00,220
you know,

3182
01:43:00,220 --> 01:43:01,240
I'm going to let you go.

3183
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:04,300
Just tell her that it's from me,

3184
01:43:04,301 --> 01:43:05,290
that you owe this for me.

3185
01:43:06,060 --> 01:43:06,190
Well,

3186
01:43:06,190 --> 01:43:09,040
that's a nice car and get
lucky and get a nice cop.

3187
01:43:09,130 --> 01:43:09,710
Yeah.

3188
01:43:09,710 --> 01:43:10,660
I don't have a many time.

3189
01:43:10,690 --> 01:43:12,130
And then with John Lilly,

3190
01:43:12,490 --> 01:43:13,323
um,

3191
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:15,590
you know,

3192
01:43:15,590 --> 01:43:18,610
one of the isomers is more
active than the other.

3193
01:43:18,850 --> 01:43:20,920
And so that was interesting,

3194
01:43:20,921 --> 01:43:25,921
but I also did get the sense that he was
too much into the ketamine and too much

3195
01:43:26,501 --> 01:43:27,790
into this other state.

3196
01:43:28,300 --> 01:43:29,020
And it,

3197
01:43:29,020 --> 01:43:34,020
I started trying to think about how
possibly we could help him because he was

3198
01:43:34,151 --> 01:43:36,820
such a major contributor
in a hero of mine.

3199
01:43:36,821 --> 01:43:41,140
And one of the people that was a dolphin
trainer that worked with him with some

3200
01:43:41,141 --> 01:43:41,820
of his dolphins,

3201
01:43:41,820 --> 01:43:42,910
had this sense,

3202
01:43:42,950 --> 01:43:43,270
uh,

3203
01:43:43,270 --> 01:43:44,980
Roberta Goodman had this sense that,

3204
01:43:45,320 --> 01:43:46,153
uh,

3205
01:43:46,360 --> 01:43:48,040
he was also going down hill.

3206
01:43:48,070 --> 01:43:49,020
And so we are,

3207
01:43:49,120 --> 01:43:51,980
are arranged to get together

3208
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:53,570
with them to do MD may therapy.

3209
01:43:53,900 --> 01:43:58,760
And during that he kind of
became very much into his body,

3210
01:43:58,940 --> 01:44:01,520
but he had abscesses from
where he was shooting himself.

3211
01:44:02,390 --> 01:44:03,740
He was in terrible shape.

3212
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:05,450
So he was shooting ketamine.

3213
01:44:05,510 --> 01:44:05,871
Oh yeah,

3214
01:44:05,871 --> 01:44:06,560
yeah,

3215
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:06,800
yeah.

3216
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:07,431
In our Moscow.

3217
01:44:07,431 --> 01:44:07,671
Really?

3218
01:44:07,671 --> 01:44:09,690
Or did you do IB would do it ivy.

3219
01:44:09,830 --> 01:44:11,000
Sometimes he would do it.

3220
01:44:11,001 --> 01:44:11,960
[inaudible] he would get,

3221
01:44:12,260 --> 01:44:17,260
he just was so trying to be out of body
and another place that he wasn't taking

3222
01:44:17,751 --> 01:44:18,590
care of himself.

3223
01:44:18,670 --> 01:44:19,160
Wow.

3224
01:44:19,160 --> 01:44:19,640
And he was,

3225
01:44:19,640 --> 01:44:20,130
and,

3226
01:44:20,130 --> 01:44:22,050
and it was painful to them.

3227
01:44:22,051 --> 01:44:22,190
And,

3228
01:44:22,190 --> 01:44:26,930
and so he kind of bounced into this
awareness of what he was doing.

3229
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:29,140
So he had infections and infections.

3230
01:44:29,150 --> 01:44:29,450
Yeah.

3231
01:44:29,450 --> 01:44:30,220
He was her.

3232
01:44:30,220 --> 01:44:31,053
Wow.

3233
01:44:31,100 --> 01:44:31,521
And He,

3234
01:44:31,521 --> 01:44:32,354
um,

3235
01:44:32,810 --> 01:44:34,670
he didn't want to stay
there and deal with it.

3236
01:44:34,671 --> 01:44:36,120
And so what we,

3237
01:44:36,220 --> 01:44:37,790
we couldn't help him,

3238
01:44:37,960 --> 01:44:38,793
you know,

3239
01:44:38,930 --> 01:44:40,600
because he didn't want it,

3240
01:44:40,601 --> 01:44:41,880
didn't want to deal with it.

3241
01:44:42,190 --> 01:44:45,320
Also is probably dealing with the
reality of what the king body,

3242
01:44:45,620 --> 01:44:47,570
and he was an older man
and he probably figured,

3243
01:44:47,571 --> 01:44:48,051
you know what,

3244
01:44:48,051 --> 01:44:48,321
this,

3245
01:44:48,321 --> 01:44:49,550
these states of mind,

3246
01:44:49,551 --> 01:44:50,660
I like this better.

3247
01:44:51,070 --> 01:44:51,350
You know,

3248
01:44:51,350 --> 01:44:53,420
I'll just ride this bitch
until the wheels fall off.

3249
01:44:53,450 --> 01:44:53,691
I mean,

3250
01:44:53,691 --> 01:44:57,050
there's a lot of people that
take that approach as well.

3251
01:44:57,180 --> 01:44:57,650
Yeah.

3252
01:44:57,650 --> 01:45:00,830
And I'll end up to a guy who spent
so much time in altered states of

3253
01:45:00,831 --> 01:45:01,664
consciousness.

3254
01:45:02,240 --> 01:45:05,330
I don't think it's unreasonable
to like prefer that.

3255
01:45:07,300 --> 01:45:08,150
I think it is.

3256
01:45:08,151 --> 01:45:13,151
I think it is because I think when
you get this deeper sense about how

3257
01:45:15,620 --> 01:45:19,910
life is so precious that that you
can have these other states of mind,

3258
01:45:19,940 --> 01:45:24,020
but that it should be
inculcating compassion,

3259
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:27,350
a sense that you have to contribute
to make it a better world.

3260
01:45:27,590 --> 01:45:32,060
That this kind of self destructive
isn't ultimately a few times,

3261
01:45:32,061 --> 01:45:32,290
I mean,

3262
01:45:32,290 --> 01:45:32,870
there isn't,

3263
01:45:32,870 --> 01:45:33,381
we live,

3264
01:45:33,381 --> 01:45:33,920
we die.

3265
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:34,540
I mean,

3266
01:45:34,540 --> 01:45:34,950
um,

3267
01:45:34,950 --> 01:45:38,810
that this guy is feeling is Bobby
giving out on him and he says,

3268
01:45:38,811 --> 01:45:39,171
you know what?

3269
01:45:39,171 --> 01:45:42,860
I'm just gonna Shoot Ketamine
until the boat hits the rocks.

3270
01:45:43,250 --> 01:45:43,610
Well,

3271
01:45:43,610 --> 01:45:46,100
I think giving makes people happy.

3272
01:45:46,250 --> 01:45:47,900
A lot of times people are depressed,

3273
01:45:47,901 --> 01:45:48,141
you know,

3274
01:45:48,141 --> 01:45:50,270
if they serve or help others.

3275
01:45:50,330 --> 01:45:51,260
I even thought about that,

3276
01:45:51,261 --> 01:45:52,100
about the vet that,

3277
01:45:52,550 --> 01:45:52,851
you know,

3278
01:45:52,851 --> 01:45:54,050
if there was some way,

3279
01:45:54,740 --> 01:45:54,921
you know,

3280
01:45:54,921 --> 01:45:58,100
he felt that he was a harm to his family
and that he was doing them good by

3281
01:45:58,101 --> 01:45:59,000
killing himself.

3282
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:04,600
And I think if only there would've been
some soup kitchen or something that he

3283
01:46:04,641 --> 01:46:06,530
could have felt that he was contributing,

3284
01:46:06,830 --> 01:46:08,030
maybe that would have,

3285
01:46:08,350 --> 01:46:10,270
and we kind of addressed that.

3286
01:46:10,280 --> 01:46:14,120
Didn't even know he was talking about the
all the widows and created and that he

3287
01:46:14,121 --> 01:46:16,550
didn't feel like he had
the the right to exist.

3288
01:46:16,580 --> 01:46:16,880
Right.

3289
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:19,850
But that's psychological
material to work through.

3290
01:46:19,970 --> 01:46:22,170
That's not necessary.

3291
01:46:22,310 --> 01:46:26,240
And I think even that's
a hard thing to say.

3292
01:46:26,241 --> 01:46:29,750
But you're saying it from coming from
someone who was an MDM experiences.

3293
01:46:29,990 --> 01:46:31,520
And I think unless somebody has,

3294
01:46:31,530 --> 01:46:32,363
they really would,

3295
01:46:32,460 --> 01:46:35,030
would listen to this
like a straight person.

3296
01:46:35,450 --> 01:46:36,530
Not not mean knocked day,

3297
01:46:36,531 --> 01:46:39,110
but I mean a square car
has never done any drugs.

3298
01:46:39,111 --> 01:46:39,750
And Paul,

3299
01:46:39,750 --> 01:46:44,450
I've really not been into drugs and
I've took some percocets in college.

3300
01:46:44,900 --> 01:46:46,310
If that person heard that,

3301
01:46:46,311 --> 01:46:46,581
there we go.

3302
01:46:46,581 --> 01:46:47,960
What is this guy talking about?

3303
01:46:47,961 --> 01:46:49,980
Like if the guy had post traumatic stress

3304
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:52,620
disorder from murdering
people and you know,

3305
01:46:52,621 --> 01:46:56,490
committing war crimes and he's openly
spoke about it in this letter and then

3306
01:46:57,390 --> 01:47:00,450
you're telling them he's going to
take ecstasy and he's going to,

3307
01:47:00,870 --> 01:47:02,400
he's going to be able
to work through that.

3308
01:47:02,430 --> 01:47:03,560
Like what of,

3309
01:47:03,570 --> 01:47:04,830
what the fuck are you talking about?

3310
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:05,301
Yeah,

3311
01:47:05,301 --> 01:47:06,410
that's a really good point.

3312
01:47:06,780 --> 01:47:07,161
In fact,

3313
01:47:07,161 --> 01:47:08,450
people have accused us of like,

3314
01:47:08,451 --> 01:47:10,820
you're going to try to help
people just forget what they did.

3315
01:47:10,821 --> 01:47:14,930
And you can make mindless soldiers who
will commit war crimes and then they get

3316
01:47:14,931 --> 01:47:16,700
a drug and they feel
better and they go back.

3317
01:47:16,701 --> 01:47:18,650
And so I think that's a really good point,

3318
01:47:18,651 --> 01:47:18,990
your race,

3319
01:47:18,990 --> 01:47:23,180
because it's not that
people say that was good,

3320
01:47:23,181 --> 01:47:25,490
that I can accept that that was good.

3321
01:47:25,491 --> 01:47:28,610
They don't reframe what they
did into something good,

3322
01:47:28,970 --> 01:47:31,130
but they realize that they,

3323
01:47:31,940 --> 01:47:32,810
it's done.

3324
01:47:32,990 --> 01:47:34,370
If they accept it,

3325
01:47:34,670 --> 01:47:39,670
it can give them the chance in the
rest of their life to make up for it.

3326
01:47:40,550 --> 01:47:41,990
Not that you can in any way,

3327
01:47:41,991 --> 01:47:45,260
but it gives you a way to go
forward in a positive way.

3328
01:47:45,680 --> 01:47:49,640
And I think that if we
do this in a marine's,

3329
01:47:49,641 --> 01:47:50,474
let's say,

3330
01:47:50,600 --> 01:47:55,600
my guess is that it will make them more
sensitive about those kind of occasions

3331
01:47:57,950 --> 01:48:02,030
where they might be reckless with their
machine gun or something that it might

3332
01:48:02,031 --> 01:48:03,920
make them more careful.

3333
01:48:04,040 --> 01:48:04,460
Um,

3334
01:48:04,460 --> 01:48:05,241
I don't know.

3335
01:48:05,241 --> 01:48:07,220
These are like unknown questions and it's,

3336
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:08,210
it's really important.

3337
01:48:08,211 --> 01:48:13,211
But the process of dealing with post
traumatic stress disorder is to more live

3338
01:48:13,701 --> 01:48:14,534
in the present,

3339
01:48:14,780 --> 01:48:17,540
to let the past inform you,

3340
01:48:17,541 --> 01:48:18,980
not to deny it and,

3341
01:48:19,010 --> 01:48:23,420
but not to be so oppressed by it
and to accept what you've done.

3342
01:48:23,421 --> 01:48:27,230
And I think once you accept that there
is that evil and all of us that we have

3343
01:48:27,231 --> 01:48:28,880
to like those,

3344
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:29,361
you know,

3345
01:48:29,361 --> 01:48:33,920
that we all have the capacity under
certain circumstances to that,

3346
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:35,300
that you can accept that.

3347
01:48:35,690 --> 01:48:36,380
And,

3348
01:48:36,380 --> 01:48:37,213
uh,

3349
01:48:37,310 --> 01:48:42,310
what we hope is that people then can move
forward and recognize that they still

3350
01:48:42,531 --> 01:48:46,010
have some life and every day they can
make choices and everyday they can try to

3351
01:48:46,040 --> 01:48:48,530
be helpful to somebody or we're not.

3352
01:48:48,650 --> 01:48:50,870
And I think that's what
we're talking about,

3353
01:48:50,871 --> 01:48:51,321
the healing.

3354
01:48:51,321 --> 01:48:55,160
It doesn't make them look back
and say that was okay what I did.

3355
01:48:56,300 --> 01:49:00,560
I think we are in a
very strange period of,

3356
01:49:00,561 --> 01:49:00,831
of,

3357
01:49:00,831 --> 01:49:03,530
of human history where we,

3358
01:49:03,630 --> 01:49:05,930
we know that we have all these issues.

3359
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:09,140
We know we have massive
government corruption.

3360
01:49:09,141 --> 01:49:11,180
We know we have massive
financial corruption.

3361
01:49:11,420 --> 01:49:15,770
We know we have the great majority of
people who don't agree with war acts that

3362
01:49:15,771 --> 01:49:16,401
are going on,

3363
01:49:16,401 --> 01:49:18,410
whether it's drone
attacks or what have you.

3364
01:49:18,920 --> 01:49:20,300
And we wonder like,

3365
01:49:20,301 --> 01:49:22,610
why is our society so far behind?

3366
01:49:22,611 --> 01:49:27,611
Why have we achieved so such great
technological and military heights,

3367
01:49:29,570 --> 01:49:32,210
but yet socially were so fucked up.

3368
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:36,170
And we have all the tools to fix that.

3369
01:49:36,350 --> 01:49:38,000
And that's what's really insane.

3370
01:49:38,001 --> 01:49:43,001
It's like individuals have found with
their own unique situations that through

3371
01:49:43,341 --> 01:49:48,250
yoga or through Mtma or
through meditation or even some

3372
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:50,080
through religious chanting.

3373
01:49:50,081 --> 01:49:50,271
And,

3374
01:49:50,271 --> 01:49:50,521
and,

3375
01:49:50,521 --> 01:49:51,000
and,

3376
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:51,241
and,

3377
01:49:51,241 --> 01:49:56,241
and learning how control of your
breath can change states of mine.

3378
01:49:56,500 --> 01:49:59,110
People have gone that through jogging.

3379
01:49:59,140 --> 01:50:01,390
You were talking about
smoking pot and getting high.

3380
01:50:01,540 --> 01:50:05,320
I know a lot of people who think things
through when they're jogging and let

3381
01:50:05,321 --> 01:50:07,060
things go when they're jogging too.

3382
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:09,520
I think there's many,

3383
01:50:09,521 --> 01:50:09,971
many,

3384
01:50:09,971 --> 01:50:14,971
many pieces that we can use
to try to fix this problem.

3385
01:50:15,790 --> 01:50:16,623
And they all,

3386
01:50:16,690 --> 01:50:17,890
they're all documented.

3387
01:50:18,110 --> 01:50:20,260
Like we're not living in
the dark ages anymore.

3388
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:20,710
Right.

3389
01:50:20,710 --> 01:50:23,950
And I think this is one of the
first generations it's been around.

3390
01:50:23,951 --> 01:50:25,930
It's experienced that
that has that many tools.

3391
01:50:25,931 --> 01:50:29,950
And I think you're right on when you
talked about how we're overdeveloped

3392
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:34,000
intellectually and underdeveloped
emotionally and spiritually.

3393
01:50:34,120 --> 01:50:35,920
It's not even that were underdeveloped.

3394
01:50:36,070 --> 01:50:38,170
It's just were not developed at all.

3395
01:50:38,620 --> 01:50:39,161
You know what I mean?

3396
01:50:39,161 --> 01:50:43,930
It's like most people were acting on
momentum or imitating their atmosphere.

3397
01:50:44,470 --> 01:50:44,740
Yeah.

3398
01:50:44,740 --> 01:50:44,921
Well,

3399
01:50:44,921 --> 01:50:45,910
were developed some,

3400
01:50:45,911 --> 01:50:49,840
we think the primates are pure instincts.

3401
01:50:49,860 --> 01:50:50,470
Yeah.

3402
01:50:50,470 --> 01:50:50,801
I mean,

3403
01:50:50,801 --> 01:50:53,980
as a science society it's pretty crazy.

3404
01:50:53,981 --> 01:50:54,221
I mean,

3405
01:50:54,221 --> 01:50:54,910
groups are,

3406
01:50:54,910 --> 01:50:55,241
you know,

3407
01:50:55,241 --> 01:50:55,481
that,

3408
01:50:55,481 --> 01:50:56,380
that's what I thought about,

3409
01:50:57,130 --> 01:50:57,490
you know,

3410
01:50:57,490 --> 01:50:58,091
Hitler's Jeremy,

3411
01:50:58,091 --> 01:50:58,241
that,

3412
01:50:58,241 --> 01:50:59,800
that you've got a culture that's insane.

3413
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:00,461
We're not,

3414
01:51:00,461 --> 01:51:02,260
we're rights North Korea right now.

3415
01:51:02,590 --> 01:51:04,540
They're all programmed and yeah.

3416
01:51:04,541 --> 01:51:08,380
So that there's a way in which
if you look at our technology,

3417
01:51:08,381 --> 01:51:09,790
which is miraculous,

3418
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:11,793
but we,

3419
01:51:11,800 --> 01:51:15,460
and we have capacities now to alter
the planet with global warming,

3420
01:51:15,730 --> 01:51:20,730
but we don't have the emotional and
spiritual development to cope with the

3421
01:51:22,451 --> 01:51:23,650
technological changes.

3422
01:51:23,651 --> 01:51:26,050
And in a way that's
been really productive,

3423
01:51:26,051 --> 01:51:30,340
this kind of separating out the
intellect from religion and morals,

3424
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:30,610
you know,

3425
01:51:30,610 --> 01:51:34,890
because religion and morals sort of
squashed the intellect and didn't want a

3426
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:37,630
Copernicus and Galileo and
just a whole history of things.

3427
01:51:38,040 --> 01:51:42,480
But is that really religious or is that
just the people claiming to be religious

3428
01:51:42,550 --> 01:51:43,600
human beings?

3429
01:51:43,650 --> 01:51:44,080
Yeah.

3430
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:44,381
Right.

3431
01:51:44,381 --> 01:51:48,520
It's just the ideologies behind these
ideas that didn't want to relinquish

3432
01:51:48,521 --> 01:51:48,940
power.

3433
01:51:48,940 --> 01:51:49,121
Yeah.

3434
01:51:49,121 --> 01:51:54,121
Because Albert Einstein talked about
how a true science and true religion are

3435
01:51:55,091 --> 01:51:56,320
not in opposition,

3436
01:51:57,120 --> 01:51:59,140
and that the scientist is also,

3437
01:51:59,160 --> 01:51:59,680
you know,

3438
01:51:59,680 --> 01:52:02,380
in a state of wonder and
spiritual appreciation.

3439
01:52:02,650 --> 01:52:02,861
Yeah.

3440
01:52:02,861 --> 01:52:06,730
Because people that think that religion
is ridiculous or that God is ridiculous,

3441
01:52:06,731 --> 01:52:08,460
or the concept of a
higher powers with Dojo,

3442
01:52:08,470 --> 01:52:08,740
us,

3443
01:52:08,740 --> 01:52:10,090
you know what else is ridiculous?

3444
01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:11,860
The whole universe itself,

3445
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:14,050
the fact that there's a
floating ball quarter,

3446
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:16,210
the size of the earth called the moon,

3447
01:52:16,330 --> 01:52:18,820
just floating in space above us.

3448
01:52:19,450 --> 01:52:19,870
How?

3449
01:52:19,870 --> 01:52:21,190
How heavy is that stupid thing?

3450
01:52:21,370 --> 01:52:22,810
It's just floating above us.

3451
01:52:22,840 --> 01:52:23,021
Oh,

3452
01:52:23,021 --> 01:52:23,854
and without it,

3453
01:52:24,100 --> 01:52:29,050
our world would not exist because our
temperature would not be regulated enough

3454
01:52:29,051 --> 01:52:31,420
that we could live in cold
climates and hot climates.

3455
01:52:31,421 --> 01:52:33,490
It wouldn't be predictable enough.

3456
01:52:33,590 --> 01:52:34,423
We'd be fucked.

3457
01:52:34,690 --> 01:52:34,961
I mean,

3458
01:52:34,961 --> 01:52:35,320
that's,

3459
01:52:35,320 --> 01:52:36,011
that's crazy.

3460
01:52:36,011 --> 01:52:39,960
That's way crazier than some guy
who built everything through,

3461
01:52:39,970 --> 01:52:40,600
you know,

3462
01:52:40,600 --> 01:52:41,590
big bang.

3463
01:52:41,620 --> 01:52:44,590
That's crazier than anything that
religions ever come up with ever.

3464
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:46,280
That the whole universe was smaller

3465
01:52:46,280 --> 01:52:50,780
than the head of a pin and then exploded
13 point whatever billion years ago and

3466
01:52:50,781 --> 01:52:52,940
created the skies above
and everything you said.

3467
01:52:53,150 --> 01:52:53,331
Yeah.

3468
01:52:53,331 --> 01:52:53,841
Well you said,

3469
01:52:53,841 --> 01:52:54,441
is it futile?

3470
01:52:54,441 --> 01:52:55,430
You live and you die.

3471
01:52:55,460 --> 01:53:00,460
And I think that those moments of
wonder or appreciation for just how

3472
01:53:00,741 --> 01:53:01,521
miraculous,

3473
01:53:01,521 --> 01:53:05,090
mysterious and comprehensible
or those moments of love,

3474
01:53:05,120 --> 01:53:08,750
that there's a way in which
they make life worth it.

3475
01:53:08,960 --> 01:53:09,560
I agree.

3476
01:53:09,560 --> 01:53:11,310
And I think that there can be a,

3477
01:53:11,430 --> 01:53:11,820
I wanna,

3478
01:53:11,820 --> 01:53:13,370
I don't wanna use the word religion,

3479
01:53:13,371 --> 01:53:15,740
but their kin and then I'm like ideology.

3480
01:53:15,741 --> 01:53:20,741
But there could be a way of living
the life with wonder and with sharing

3481
01:53:22,281 --> 01:53:27,281
knowledge and with just looking into
what we have learned rock solid about the

3482
01:53:30,531 --> 01:53:34,340
very universe we live in and
respecting that and worshiping that.

3483
01:53:34,390 --> 01:53:35,420
I mean in a way,

3484
01:53:35,421 --> 01:53:36,020
you know,

3485
01:53:36,020 --> 01:53:40,040
not like I'm not talking about
like a deity but about like,

3486
01:53:40,070 --> 01:53:41,540
like a great wonder,

3487
01:53:41,541 --> 01:53:44,960
like the great wonder that it really
is and there's a benefit to that.

3488
01:53:45,080 --> 01:53:45,380
Yeah.

3489
01:53:45,380 --> 01:53:50,330
And taking that into the pain I think is
being able to take the loving energies

3490
01:53:50,331 --> 01:53:54,400
into the places that need
healing and that that's where,

3491
01:53:54,600 --> 01:53:59,600
so just having a spiritual meditating
on top of a mountain top and trying to,

3492
01:53:59,800 --> 01:54:00,110
you know,

3493
01:54:00,110 --> 01:54:01,640
get off the wheel of suffering and stuff.

3494
01:54:01,641 --> 01:54:05,150
That seems like a very
egotistical way actually.

3495
01:54:05,480 --> 01:54:10,480
And having the sense that while we
though some of us are privileged in all

3496
01:54:10,791 --> 01:54:15,380
different ways to really be healthy and
be wonderful with that and in wonder

3497
01:54:15,381 --> 01:54:19,160
without being so threatened that there's
a lot of people that aren't and that we

3498
01:54:19,161 --> 01:54:19,994
have to

3499
01:54:21,380 --> 01:54:22,880
not only feel those moments,

3500
01:54:22,881 --> 01:54:26,930
but then try to somehow as Martin Luther
King talked about the arc of history,

3501
01:54:26,931 --> 01:54:31,460
make some contribution of some
way that helps it for others too.

3502
01:54:31,560 --> 01:54:32,850
You know what was also ironic,

3503
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:35,580
one of the weird things
that's going on with society,

3504
01:54:35,630 --> 01:54:36,000
uh,

3505
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:40,290
is that as our technological
capabilities increase,

3506
01:54:40,590 --> 01:54:44,880
we also fill our skies with light
pollution and we can't see the stars.

3507
01:54:45,300 --> 01:54:50,300
And one of the best psychedelic
experiences I ever had
outside of doing a drug

3508
01:54:50,550 --> 01:54:54,540
was I went to the Keck observatory
and y on the big island.

3509
01:54:54,930 --> 01:54:58,200
And we drove through the
clouds and as we were driving,

3510
01:54:58,230 --> 01:55:01,620
like you wonder if it's going to be a
cloudy day eggs and you won't be able to

3511
01:55:01,621 --> 01:55:03,390
see anything because it takes
a while to get up there.

3512
01:55:03,750 --> 01:55:04,171
And I was like,

3513
01:55:04,171 --> 01:55:04,501
Damn,

3514
01:55:04,501 --> 01:55:05,520
looks like it's cloudy.

3515
01:55:05,730 --> 01:55:09,240
But then we drove through
the clouds and you realize,

3516
01:55:09,270 --> 01:55:09,421
oh,

3517
01:55:09,421 --> 01:55:13,230
this thing is so high up there that you
actually drive past where the clouds

3518
01:55:13,231 --> 01:55:13,411
are.

3519
01:55:13,411 --> 01:55:14,250
This is nuts.

3520
01:55:14,700 --> 01:55:19,700
And we went up to the observatory and
the view is just insane because the big

3521
01:55:22,021 --> 01:55:24,030
island is set up for the observatory,

3522
01:55:24,031 --> 01:55:28,020
so all the lights that they use for
streetlights or a very special type of

3523
01:55:28,021 --> 01:55:30,600
diffused lighting that doesn't
give light pollution off.

3524
01:55:30,930 --> 01:55:35,930
So you have this incredible view of the
stars where you see the whole Milky Way,

3525
01:55:36,991 --> 01:55:37,950
like a movie,

3526
01:55:37,951 --> 01:55:38,400
like,

3527
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:41,640
like those pictures of space
and somehow or another,

3528
01:55:41,641 --> 01:55:44,640
it's just above us and
you're looking at it,

3529
01:55:44,670 --> 01:55:45,270
it's,

3530
01:55:45,270 --> 01:55:48,070
it's so unbelievably humbling and,

3531
01:55:48,071 --> 01:55:48,810
and,

3532
01:55:48,810 --> 01:55:49,710
and magical.

3533
01:55:49,711 --> 01:55:50,041
I was like,

3534
01:55:50,041 --> 01:55:54,630
I was staring into the impossible and I
remember being upset that I couldn't see

3535
01:55:54,631 --> 01:55:57,480
this every night that's
up there all the time.

3536
01:55:57,500 --> 01:55:57,691
And,

3537
01:55:57,691 --> 01:56:01,380
and not seeing that and just
making it this blank screen.

3538
01:56:01,740 --> 01:56:04,350
By doing that you sort of like lose,

3539
01:56:04,890 --> 01:56:07,260
you'll lose the feel for
what's really going on.

3540
01:56:07,290 --> 01:56:07,561
Yeah,

3541
01:56:07,561 --> 01:56:08,880
we're out of touch with that a lot.

3542
01:56:08,881 --> 01:56:12,160
I had this bonding moment
with in some ways my opposite.

3543
01:56:12,161 --> 01:56:16,260
And my family and I were on a vacation
in Israel and we decided to go across the

3544
01:56:16,261 --> 01:56:20,280
Sinai desert by car to go
see a Cairo and the pyramids.

3545
01:56:20,640 --> 01:56:25,200
And we had to work with an
Egyptian company and they
had people had armed guards

3546
01:56:25,201 --> 01:56:26,730
cause it's kind of dangerous now.

3547
01:56:27,270 --> 01:56:30,660
And so as we were driving
through the Sinai desert,

3548
01:56:31,110 --> 01:56:31,860
um,

3549
01:56:31,860 --> 01:56:34,590
and it was so dark and
the sky was magnificent,

3550
01:56:34,650 --> 01:56:39,630
we asked if we could just stop the car
and just sort of walk a bit from the

3551
01:56:39,631 --> 01:56:39,841
road.

3552
01:56:39,841 --> 01:56:40,470
There was hardly any,

3553
01:56:40,470 --> 01:56:42,330
virtually no other traffic on the road.

3554
01:56:42,390 --> 01:56:42,811
The only thing,

3555
01:56:42,811 --> 01:56:46,110
we're military checkpoints every
once in a while and we just went out.

3556
01:56:46,111 --> 01:56:47,370
And so these,

3557
01:56:47,420 --> 01:56:48,000
um,

3558
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,020
it was Ramadan too.

3559
01:56:49,560 --> 01:56:54,560
And so these Muslims who
were with guns to protect us,

3560
01:56:55,380 --> 01:56:55,860
uh,

3561
01:56:55,860 --> 01:56:56,551
who are Jewish,

3562
01:56:56,551 --> 01:56:59,760
we just stood under the stars in the
middle of the desert with no light

3563
01:56:59,761 --> 01:57:04,230
pollution and just had this
shared moment of kind of odd.

3564
01:57:04,260 --> 01:57:05,250
The Majesty.

3565
01:57:05,740 --> 01:57:06,330
Yeah.

3566
01:57:06,330 --> 01:57:07,163
The,

3567
01:57:07,330 --> 01:57:07,910
the,

3568
01:57:07,910 --> 01:57:12,310
the view of the actual view
that we're supposed to see,

3569
01:57:12,520 --> 01:57:16,500
I think is really what inspired
people throughout history to,

3570
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:19,150
to create the idea of
gods and to create this,

3571
01:57:19,530 --> 01:57:19,921
I mean the,

3572
01:57:19,921 --> 01:57:20,160
the,

3573
01:57:20,160 --> 01:57:23,560
the insane view that you get of that,

3574
01:57:23,680 --> 01:57:27,250
that just the images of those
magical lights in the sky,

3575
01:57:28,150 --> 01:57:29,860
millions and billions of them.

3576
01:57:29,861 --> 01:57:31,340
Just to see that it's,

3577
01:57:31,600 --> 01:57:34,770
it's so humbling and to not see that it's,

3578
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:36,280
it's so dead.

3579
01:57:36,281 --> 01:57:37,300
It's sold numb.

3580
01:57:37,770 --> 01:57:40,690
Like we don't have an appreciation
for the fact that we're in space.

3581
01:57:40,840 --> 01:57:41,980
You watch a documentary,

3582
01:57:41,981 --> 01:57:43,240
it seems kind of abstract,

3583
01:57:43,540 --> 01:57:45,900
but when you're on top of
the observatory and you,

3584
01:57:45,901 --> 01:57:49,300
you look out and you have that
incredible view of the stars,

3585
01:57:49,750 --> 01:57:50,140
you go,

3586
01:57:50,140 --> 01:57:51,340
oh my God.

3587
01:57:51,580 --> 01:57:53,800
Like we are really in space right now.

3588
01:57:53,801 --> 01:57:58,801
We are on a big organic spaceship and
we're moving thousand miles an hour in a

3589
01:57:59,651 --> 01:58:00,484
circle.

3590
01:58:00,490 --> 01:58:01,323
Yeah.

3591
01:58:01,390 --> 01:58:02,223
It's nuts.

3592
01:58:02,500 --> 01:58:02,830
It's,

3593
01:58:02,830 --> 01:58:04,120
it's weird to see.

3594
01:58:04,150 --> 01:58:04,310
Right.

3595
01:58:04,310 --> 01:58:04,861
And what,

3596
01:58:04,861 --> 01:58:07,890
what it's done to Stuart brand
talked about a lot about the,

3597
01:58:07,970 --> 01:58:11,190
with the whole or is cloud the
picture of the earth from space?

3598
01:58:11,191 --> 01:58:11,600
Yeah.

3599
01:58:11,600 --> 01:58:15,380
We're the first generation or
two that's ever had that image.

3600
01:58:15,590 --> 01:58:18,250
And those astronauts that
go up in the space station,

3601
01:58:18,260 --> 01:58:19,093
a spatial,

3602
01:58:19,130 --> 01:58:21,530
they all talk about the experience.

3603
01:58:21,590 --> 01:58:23,120
It's being very transcendent.

3604
01:58:23,480 --> 01:58:24,290
You know,

3605
01:58:24,290 --> 01:58:28,910
when you take that view of the
earth from above and you look down,

3606
01:58:28,911 --> 01:58:33,911
you see just the nature of the whole
reality of a planet in the solar system,

3607
01:58:35,991 --> 01:58:37,070
in a galaxy,

3608
01:58:37,071 --> 01:58:37,910
in a universe.

3609
01:58:37,911 --> 01:58:38,570
And it's,

3610
01:58:38,570 --> 01:58:40,250
it all just sort of falls into place.

3611
01:58:40,251 --> 01:58:40,610
You're like,

3612
01:58:40,610 --> 01:58:41,800
oh my God.

3613
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:45,580
But when you're down here and you're
stuck in traffic and the skies dark,

3614
01:58:45,910 --> 01:58:46,960
you don't even think about it,

3615
01:58:46,961 --> 01:58:47,590
but you're,

3616
01:58:47,590 --> 01:58:50,350
you're on this majestic
ride through the heavens.

3617
01:58:50,351 --> 01:58:52,540
Instead you're overwhelmed with a Moan,

3618
01:58:52,600 --> 01:58:55,150
mundane bullshit of this
person in front of you,

3619
01:58:55,151 --> 01:58:56,530
not reacting to the green light.

3620
01:58:56,830 --> 01:58:57,663
Come on.

3621
01:58:58,490 --> 01:59:00,260
And if you can somehow do both,

3622
01:59:00,290 --> 01:59:01,010
it's not that.

3623
01:59:01,010 --> 01:59:01,230
Yeah.

3624
01:59:01,230 --> 01:59:03,320
And that's where I think
lily lily got wrong.

3625
01:59:03,380 --> 01:59:03,631
You know,

3626
01:59:03,631 --> 01:59:05,930
you've got the spiritual part
was the more important part.

3627
01:59:05,931 --> 01:59:07,160
And it's the balance.

3628
01:59:07,640 --> 01:59:07,790
I,

3629
01:59:07,790 --> 01:59:08,421
my daughter,

3630
01:59:08,421 --> 01:59:12,590
Ellie is in eighth grade and
she had to do a project with,

3631
01:59:12,591 --> 01:59:13,100
uh,

3632
01:59:13,100 --> 01:59:16,100
for national history day and
with a couple of her girlfriends,

3633
01:59:16,101 --> 01:59:17,720
they did a project on Apollo 11,

3634
01:59:17,721 --> 01:59:18,554
which was,

3635
01:59:18,650 --> 01:59:19,520
and it turned out that,

3636
01:59:19,730 --> 01:59:20,210
um,

3637
01:59:20,210 --> 01:59:21,410
the girl that she did it with,

3638
01:59:22,040 --> 01:59:23,720
Michael Collins was her grandfather.

3639
01:59:23,721 --> 01:59:25,510
He was the one that was on the,

3640
01:59:25,930 --> 01:59:27,530
when Armstrong put his foot on the,

3641
01:59:28,190 --> 01:59:31,790
and I'm buzz Aldridge that he was
the one that stayed in the capsule.

3642
01:59:31,791 --> 01:59:35,630
And so they actually got to interview
him as part of this and he did talk about

3643
01:59:35,930 --> 01:59:40,910
for him what was so amazing both being
up there in space and seeing the earth,

3644
01:59:40,911 --> 01:59:45,110
but also when he got back and they
went around the world and people were

3645
01:59:45,620 --> 01:59:46,910
cheering and talking about things,

3646
01:59:46,940 --> 01:59:50,360
he said that he thought
that people would say,

3647
01:59:50,690 --> 01:59:51,140
you know,

3648
01:59:51,140 --> 01:59:52,730
look what you Americans did.

3649
01:59:53,240 --> 01:59:54,710
And wherever we went,

3650
01:59:54,711 --> 01:59:55,101
people said,

3651
01:59:55,101 --> 01:59:56,000
look what we did.

3652
01:59:56,900 --> 02:00:01,700
Like it was the human race that we went
to the moon and people wanted to be part

3653
02:00:01,701 --> 02:00:02,534
of that.

3654
02:00:02,780 --> 02:00:03,680
And he,

3655
02:00:03,681 --> 02:00:05,750
because it was such a
space race with Russia,

3656
02:00:05,751 --> 02:00:06,080
he started,

3657
02:00:06,080 --> 02:00:06,651
we did it.

3658
02:00:06,651 --> 02:00:07,484
But he saw,

3659
02:00:07,610 --> 02:00:07,870
you know,

3660
02:00:07,870 --> 02:00:08,870
we're Americans did it,

3661
02:00:08,871 --> 02:00:12,290
but he saw around the world that
people said we all collectively did it

3662
02:00:12,900 --> 02:00:13,130
well,

3663
02:00:13,130 --> 02:00:16,230
the idea of we all collectively
are in this thing together,

3664
02:00:16,231 --> 02:00:18,060
that we are a global community.

3665
02:00:18,290 --> 02:00:22,680
And that's really one of the
last saving hopes of humanity.

3666
02:00:22,890 --> 02:00:26,010
And I think the Internet has sort of
reinforced that idea in a way that never

3667
02:00:26,011 --> 02:00:26,844
existed.

3668
02:00:26,940 --> 02:00:28,020
I think nationalism,

3669
02:00:28,021 --> 02:00:31,020
the idea of nationalism seems
so much more preposterous now,

3670
02:00:31,320 --> 02:00:33,160
especially nationalism and a war sense.

3671
02:00:33,610 --> 02:00:34,443
Nationalism,

3672
02:00:34,500 --> 02:00:36,440
it's nothing wrong with being
proud of the town you live in.

3673
02:00:36,470 --> 02:00:36,630
No,

3674
02:00:36,630 --> 02:00:39,420
nothing brought warm
with a cheering for the,

3675
02:00:39,421 --> 02:00:40,050
you know,

3676
02:00:40,050 --> 02:00:41,490
your home basketball team.

3677
02:00:41,491 --> 02:00:42,870
There's nothing wrong with any of that.

3678
02:00:43,140 --> 02:00:46,050
But what's wrong is when
it translates into war.

3679
02:00:46,051 --> 02:00:51,051
And I think that this is the first
culture that has really sort of openly

3680
02:00:52,111 --> 02:00:54,750
embraced a global society.

3681
02:00:54,990 --> 02:00:55,590
You know,

3682
02:00:55,590 --> 02:00:57,120
I think kids today,

3683
02:00:57,150 --> 02:01:02,150
they're far less likely to
buy the bullshit when it
comes to us against them or

3684
02:01:02,821 --> 02:01:04,110
any ideas about,

3685
02:01:04,380 --> 02:01:04,651
you know,

3686
02:01:04,651 --> 02:01:06,930
what's really going on with
geopolitical struggles.

3687
02:01:07,100 --> 02:01:07,933
Yeah.

3688
02:01:08,180 --> 02:01:10,050
We know the kids in Iran,

3689
02:01:10,170 --> 02:01:11,003
like they're just,

3690
02:01:11,160 --> 02:01:13,500
they're kids to try and get out of the,

3691
02:01:13,710 --> 02:01:15,570
under the thumb of an
oppressive government.

3692
02:01:15,660 --> 02:01:17,190
What my son Eden,

3693
02:01:17,191 --> 02:01:18,750
who is just going to college,

3694
02:01:18,751 --> 02:01:21,840
he was playing a halo
and you can play multip,

3695
02:01:22,240 --> 02:01:22,681
you know,

3696
02:01:22,681 --> 02:01:24,960
and he was playing with
somebody in a Saudi Arabia.

3697
02:01:26,090 --> 02:01:27,560
It's so great.

3698
02:01:27,670 --> 02:01:28,800
It's fantastic.

3699
02:01:28,801 --> 02:01:33,290
And I think what we see a lot
is the rise of fundamentalism.

3700
02:01:33,320 --> 02:01:33,630
You know,

3701
02:01:33,630 --> 02:01:35,250
the Orthodox Jews are nuts.

3702
02:01:35,251 --> 02:01:36,084
The,

3703
02:01:36,150 --> 02:01:38,220
some of the Orthodox
Christians and Muslims,

3704
02:01:38,250 --> 02:01:39,083
all these,

3705
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:42,740
I think because of the
forces of globalization,

3706
02:01:42,741 --> 02:01:45,950
because it's harder to
sustain that we're the one,

3707
02:01:45,951 --> 02:01:46,191
right?

3708
02:01:46,191 --> 02:01:46,730
Religion,

3709
02:01:46,730 --> 02:01:47,001
they're,

3710
02:01:47,001 --> 02:01:50,660
they're kind of having to circle their
wagons and they become a bit more

3711
02:01:50,661 --> 02:01:51,494
extreme.

3712
02:01:51,860 --> 02:01:54,470
And so it might look on the surface
that things are getting worse.

3713
02:01:54,471 --> 02:01:59,210
But I think that's this defensive
mechanism where they can barely hold it

3714
02:01:59,211 --> 02:02:00,010
together.

3715
02:02:00,010 --> 02:02:04,310
And I think it won't end up with
homogenous one world religion,

3716
02:02:04,311 --> 02:02:05,061
one government.

3717
02:02:05,061 --> 02:02:07,430
We'll appreciate those
small things about the,

3718
02:02:07,940 --> 02:02:08,121
you know,

3719
02:02:08,121 --> 02:02:09,020
the local town,

3720
02:02:09,110 --> 02:02:10,160
where are you are,

3721
02:02:10,161 --> 02:02:15,161
you can appreciate the differences
even more when you feel part of the

3722
02:02:15,411 --> 02:02:16,131
commonality.

3723
02:02:16,131 --> 02:02:18,980
You don't have to be scared of the
differences cause there's something deeper

3724
02:02:18,981 --> 02:02:19,814
that connects it.

3725
02:02:20,080 --> 02:02:24,430
I think there's also a problem that
people have in the human beings.

3726
02:02:24,431 --> 02:02:29,431
We share chimpanzee Alpha male DNA
and we are always looking for leaders.

3727
02:02:30,880 --> 02:02:31,660
And Yeah,

3728
02:02:31,660 --> 02:02:33,850
the other problem is once
someone becomes a leader,

3729
02:02:34,070 --> 02:02:34,280
uh,

3730
02:02:34,280 --> 02:02:36,460
we see there was with
politicians and dictators,

3731
02:02:36,461 --> 02:02:41,461
we saw it with the people that that came
in after Mubarak in Egypt tried to pass

3732
02:02:42,551 --> 02:02:46,540
all these crazy fucking laws that
essentially made them dictators.

3733
02:02:46,720 --> 02:02:48,220
And then the people were like,

3734
02:02:48,221 --> 02:02:49,690
what are you talking about?

3735
02:02:49,691 --> 02:02:50,350
Like this is,

3736
02:02:50,350 --> 02:02:52,510
this is what we just shed blood for.

3737
02:02:52,870 --> 02:02:57,870
Like in you assholes are trying to make
yourself immune to prosecution for all

3738
02:02:57,911 --> 02:02:59,680
these different things
that you could be doing.

3739
02:02:59,681 --> 02:03:00,550
Like fuck you.

3740
02:03:00,580 --> 02:03:00,941
No,

3741
02:03:00,941 --> 02:03:01,840
you can't do that.

3742
02:03:02,320 --> 02:03:05,410
And I think seeing that
for the first time,

3743
02:03:05,800 --> 02:03:06,633
you know,

3744
02:03:06,640 --> 02:03:07,630
globally,

3745
02:03:07,920 --> 02:03:11,530
even though right now it may be very
frustrating for us and it is frustrating

3746
02:03:11,531 --> 02:03:14,410
for us because we don't think
change is coming quickly.

3747
02:03:14,410 --> 02:03:18,100
Enough change that the corresponds
with what we know about the world.

3748
02:03:18,250 --> 02:03:19,540
I think it is.

3749
02:03:19,600 --> 02:03:21,070
If you look at it historically,

3750
02:03:21,100 --> 02:03:23,080
if they look back to this time,

3751
02:03:23,320 --> 02:03:26,620
I think this will be a time of
great turmoil and great change.

3752
02:03:26,920 --> 02:03:29,260
It's just that we measure
history and he's 20,

3753
02:03:29,261 --> 02:03:30,580
30 year bursts.

3754
02:03:31,090 --> 02:03:31,421
You know,

3755
02:03:31,421 --> 02:03:35,080
and I think the 20 year bursts that
we're in right now is just bananas.

3756
02:03:35,800 --> 02:03:36,160
Well,

3757
02:03:36,160 --> 02:03:39,010
I think as I get older and
as I watch my kids grow,

3758
02:03:39,011 --> 02:03:40,060
that for me,

3759
02:03:40,630 --> 02:03:43,360
10 or 20 years is no
longer such a long time.

3760
02:03:43,570 --> 02:03:43,871
Right?

3761
02:03:43,871 --> 02:03:44,310
It's not.

3762
02:03:44,310 --> 02:03:45,580
And I think as you get older,

3763
02:03:45,581 --> 02:03:47,020
time speeds up to,

3764
02:03:47,320 --> 02:03:50,800
and so it's like those cops
that were there so you can,

3765
02:03:50,950 --> 02:03:51,783
so you can,

3766
02:03:52,610 --> 02:03:53,980
but we're not quite so scared.

3767
02:03:53,981 --> 02:03:54,814
Parts are late.

3768
02:03:55,030 --> 02:03:56,750
And the um,

3769
02:03:57,040 --> 02:03:57,600
the side

3770
02:03:57,600 --> 02:03:58,321
of having a 20,

3771
02:03:58,321 --> 02:04:02,760
30 year plan or even to recognize as all
the spiritual traditions talked about

3772
02:04:02,761 --> 02:04:03,230
is that,

3773
02:04:03,230 --> 02:04:03,510
uh,

3774
02:04:03,510 --> 02:04:07,350
these great things are not accomplishable
in one generation or buy one in one

3775
02:04:07,351 --> 02:04:07,921
lifetime.

3776
02:04:07,921 --> 02:04:11,190
So that we just start the
process are we not start it,

3777
02:04:11,191 --> 02:04:15,090
but we continue and then we try to
pass it on to the next generation.

3778
02:04:15,091 --> 02:04:16,740
But I think that there is this,

3779
02:04:17,490 --> 02:04:17,730
you know,

3780
02:04:17,730 --> 02:04:22,730
intensification and crisis and
in that I think eventually the,

3781
02:04:23,160 --> 02:04:23,993
um,

3782
02:04:24,680 --> 02:04:25,040
the,

3783
02:04:25,040 --> 02:04:26,100
the fundamentalists,

3784
02:04:26,130 --> 02:04:28,920
we'll need to find more
genuine spirituality,

3785
02:04:29,010 --> 02:04:34,010
not in this rigidity and hopefully
they'll be able to coexist.

3786
02:04:35,420 --> 02:04:37,760
There was these demonstrations
of millions of in Egypt,

3787
02:04:37,761 --> 02:04:38,090
the,

3788
02:04:38,090 --> 02:04:38,490
you know,

3789
02:04:38,490 --> 02:04:40,080
against the Muslim broaden brotherhood.

3790
02:04:40,081 --> 02:04:44,010
This is the first government in Israel
that doesn't have the religious orthodox

3791
02:04:44,011 --> 02:04:45,600
as part of the governing body,

3792
02:04:46,140 --> 02:04:47,550
which is a really healthy thing.

3793
02:04:48,110 --> 02:04:48,360
This,

3794
02:04:48,360 --> 02:04:48,981
what does it who,

3795
02:04:48,981 --> 02:04:53,600
who made that quote history is a race
between education and catastrophe.

3796
02:04:54,440 --> 02:04:54,920
Who's that?

3797
02:04:54,920 --> 02:04:56,450
Who is responsible for that quote?

3798
02:04:56,451 --> 02:04:56,870
You know,

3799
02:04:56,870 --> 02:04:57,660
I don't know.

3800
02:04:57,660 --> 02:04:58,493
That's,

3801
02:04:59,060 --> 02:04:59,893
yeah.

3802
02:05:00,190 --> 02:05:01,490
I don't remember who it was.

3803
02:05:01,580 --> 02:05:02,450
Whoever it was.

3804
02:05:02,451 --> 02:05:04,250
They were bad motherfucker,

3805
02:05:04,550 --> 02:05:05,383
whoever it was.

3806
02:05:05,930 --> 02:05:07,000
But that's a,

3807
02:05:07,020 --> 02:05:08,780
that's really what seems to be going on.

3808
02:05:09,580 --> 02:05:10,330
Was it hg wells?

3809
02:05:10,330 --> 02:05:10,680
Yeah,

3810
02:05:10,680 --> 02:05:11,320
that was good.

3811
02:05:11,320 --> 02:05:12,980
That there really does seem to be,

3812
02:05:12,981 --> 02:05:13,761
well of course it's a,

3813
02:05:13,761 --> 02:05:14,460
she was,

3814
02:05:14,460 --> 02:05:15,293
the guy was awesome.

3815
02:05:15,950 --> 02:05:16,490
Um,

3816
02:05:16,490 --> 02:05:18,680
I think that that does
seem to be what's going on.

3817
02:05:18,681 --> 02:05:23,210
It seems to be also that sometimes
it almost feels like people need an

3818
02:05:23,211 --> 02:05:25,970
antagonist in order to
perform at their very best.

3819
02:05:26,300 --> 02:05:30,620
It's almost like we need a rival to
inspire us to reach great heights.

3820
02:05:31,270 --> 02:05:32,103
Yeah.

3821
02:05:32,140 --> 02:05:33,850
And it depends on how you see them.

3822
02:05:33,880 --> 02:05:36,520
If they're deeper down your ally,

3823
02:05:36,550 --> 02:05:37,420
so that like,

3824
02:05:37,480 --> 02:05:38,980
let's say in sports teams,

3825
02:05:39,460 --> 02:05:39,761
you know,

3826
02:05:39,761 --> 02:05:43,990
you want your opponents to be as good as
possible because that will call out the

3827
02:05:43,991 --> 02:05:44,591
best in you.

3828
02:05:44,591 --> 02:05:49,591
So at some level you want the worthy
opponent that you don't have to totally

3829
02:05:50,021 --> 02:05:50,854
destroy.

3830
02:05:51,190 --> 02:05:53,860
You just are sort of
coal valving together.

3831
02:05:53,890 --> 02:05:56,740
So I think we do need to
test ourselves against,

3832
02:05:57,250 --> 02:05:59,470
against others and against our ourselves,

3833
02:05:59,471 --> 02:06:04,390
but we don't need to see the other
side as the enemy to be destroyed.

3834
02:06:04,630 --> 02:06:06,010
And I think,

3835
02:06:06,011 --> 02:06:06,844
uh,

3836
02:06:06,880 --> 02:06:08,140
I used to play this game,

3837
02:06:08,470 --> 02:06:09,303
um,

3838
02:06:09,430 --> 02:06:13,000
grew up in Chicago in Winnetka and Lake
Michigan and some friends and I would go

3839
02:06:13,001 --> 02:06:16,840
in there and we'd play the greatest
catch game and each of us guys,

3840
02:06:16,841 --> 02:06:18,430
we'd throw a football to somebody else.

3841
02:06:18,431 --> 02:06:19,630
It was like half in the water.

3842
02:06:19,631 --> 02:06:19,981
And our,

3843
02:06:19,981 --> 02:06:24,070
our goal as the thrower was to get it
just barely where they could reach it,

3844
02:06:24,670 --> 02:06:28,180
where they had to make the spectacular
dive and show off to everybody how great

3845
02:06:28,181 --> 02:06:30,790
they were and then they
would have to do it back.

3846
02:06:30,791 --> 02:06:32,590
And so we are sort of helping.

3847
02:06:32,620 --> 02:06:32,960
We are,

3848
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:34,060
we are like allies,

3849
02:06:34,061 --> 02:06:35,470
but we were pressing each other to,

3850
02:06:35,480 --> 02:06:37,240
to do spectacular things.

3851
02:06:37,700 --> 02:06:38,930
That's really interesting.

3852
02:06:39,290 --> 02:06:41,720
Well that's one of the principles of a,

3853
02:06:41,721 --> 02:06:46,520
of Jujitsu and a martial arts is that
you really only as good as your training

3854
02:06:46,521 --> 02:06:47,090
partners.

3855
02:06:47,090 --> 02:06:47,790
Yeah.

3856
02:06:47,790 --> 02:06:49,280
Have you trained with really good people,

3857
02:06:49,281 --> 02:06:51,400
you become really good and that's you.

3858
02:06:51,401 --> 02:06:55,400
You elevate to the level of the
competition in the training room.

3859
02:06:55,760 --> 02:07:00,760
It's also the same a lot with a standup
comedians were inspired by other really

3860
02:07:00,891 --> 02:07:02,000
funny standup comedians.

3861
02:07:02,001 --> 02:07:05,920
And when you find a particular group
of group of talented people in a,

3862
02:07:05,921 --> 02:07:07,310
in a town or an area,

3863
02:07:07,490 --> 02:07:11,800
oftentimes they'll develop a lot of
very talented people around them who we

3864
02:07:11,801 --> 02:07:15,890
imitate the fact that you know that
there's a high level of the art form and

3865
02:07:15,891 --> 02:07:16,490
that area.

3866
02:07:16,490 --> 02:07:17,211
So like Austin,

3867
02:07:17,211 --> 02:07:18,440
Texas is a good example.

3868
02:07:18,441 --> 02:07:21,710
It's like there's always a lot of really
good guys there and because there's

3869
02:07:21,711 --> 02:07:23,180
always a lot of really good guys there,

3870
02:07:23,181 --> 02:07:24,500
there's always a lot of really good guys.

3871
02:07:24,501 --> 02:07:26,390
There is a New York city's and other one,

3872
02:07:26,420 --> 02:07:31,420
but obviously this much more money
involved in places like New York or La and

3873
02:07:31,761 --> 02:07:32,594
being good.

3874
02:07:32,870 --> 02:07:34,970
So that becomes sort of a factor as,

3875
02:07:35,230 --> 02:07:36,280
but are you from

3876
02:07:36,280 --> 02:07:36,550
us?

3877
02:07:36,550 --> 02:07:37,630
Did you spend time in Austin?

3878
02:07:37,680 --> 02:07:37,951
No,

3879
02:07:37,951 --> 02:07:40,800
I just have a lot of friends there
and I've done a lot of stand up there,

3880
02:07:40,980 --> 02:07:43,500
but I just know the local
scenes or he's really strong.

3881
02:07:43,560 --> 02:07:46,200
So there's a few places in
the country as a comedian,

3882
02:07:46,201 --> 02:07:46,790
the scene,

3883
02:07:46,790 --> 02:07:48,270
the local scenes are very strong.

3884
02:07:48,510 --> 02:07:49,330
Denver,

3885
02:07:49,330 --> 02:07:51,330
they always have a really
strong local scene.

3886
02:07:51,480 --> 02:07:54,510
And that's another one that's pure because
it's not really attached to Hollywood

3887
02:07:54,511 --> 02:07:56,910
and any way it's just pure standup comedy.

3888
02:07:57,120 --> 02:07:59,760
And then there's San Francisco,

3889
02:08:00,050 --> 02:08:00,660
um,

3890
02:08:00,660 --> 02:08:01,620
Boston,

3891
02:08:01,860 --> 02:08:02,371
La,

3892
02:08:02,371 --> 02:08:03,330
New York,

3893
02:08:03,690 --> 02:08:06,570
little bit of Phoenix a little bit,

3894
02:08:06,571 --> 02:08:06,811
but it's,

3895
02:08:06,811 --> 02:08:08,370
it's a very limited thing.

3896
02:08:08,640 --> 02:08:13,640
And you can sometimes one or two
great comedians will be in one area.

3897
02:08:14,400 --> 02:08:15,300
And then boom,

3898
02:08:15,330 --> 02:08:16,170
it'll blossom.

3899
02:08:16,440 --> 02:08:16,861
Like,

3900
02:08:16,861 --> 02:08:17,694
um,

3901
02:08:17,820 --> 02:08:21,060
Houston was Sam Kinison and Bill Hicks.

3902
02:08:21,270 --> 02:08:25,800
They were all at this Houston comedy
annex and because of them in this one

3903
02:08:25,801 --> 02:08:26,640
particular area,

3904
02:08:26,670 --> 02:08:27,720
it started to take off.

3905
02:08:27,840 --> 02:08:28,051
Yeah.

3906
02:08:28,051 --> 02:08:29,820
That's sort of the idea of silicon valley.

3907
02:08:29,930 --> 02:08:30,470
Yeah,

3908
02:08:30,470 --> 02:08:30,891
sure.

3909
02:08:30,891 --> 02:08:34,370
Get a bunch of brilliant people and you
get inspired by other brilliant people.

3910
02:08:34,371 --> 02:08:35,480
They share ideas.

3911
02:08:35,481 --> 02:08:35,861
They,

3912
02:08:35,861 --> 02:08:36,081
they,

3913
02:08:36,081 --> 02:08:36,411
you know,

3914
02:08:36,411 --> 02:08:37,400
they pump each other up.

3915
02:08:37,760 --> 02:08:42,760
And the idea that there's plenty for
everybody and that working together can be

3916
02:08:43,581 --> 02:08:45,530
much more satisfying and you're,

3917
02:08:45,531 --> 02:08:49,580
you're much happier if your friends
are doing well as much as you are.

3918
02:08:49,890 --> 02:08:50,723
Yeah.

3919
02:08:50,970 --> 02:08:51,300
Yeah.

3920
02:08:51,300 --> 02:08:52,133
In fact,

3921
02:08:52,560 --> 02:08:53,311
one of our,

3922
02:08:53,311 --> 02:08:53,760
um,

3923
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:53,890
uh,

3924
02:08:53,890 --> 02:08:54,750
Shawna haylight when,

3925
02:08:54,751 --> 02:08:59,751
if our board of directors who recently
died was a brilliant computer guy and he

3926
02:09:01,051 --> 02:09:02,190
kept trying to say that,

3927
02:09:02,220 --> 02:09:07,220
that we should try to think from
abundance rather than from constant need.

3928
02:09:07,801 --> 02:09:08,140
And Yeah.

3929
02:09:08,140 --> 02:09:08,591
Well that's a,

3930
02:09:08,591 --> 02:09:09,101
that's a,

3931
02:09:09,101 --> 02:09:09,490
just a,

3932
02:09:09,490 --> 02:09:11,170
a general principle of life.

3933
02:09:11,171 --> 02:09:16,120
Famine mentalities are terrible way of
approaching life and that's the way a lot

3934
02:09:16,121 --> 02:09:17,080
of people approach life.

3935
02:09:17,081 --> 02:09:20,620
They approach life as if there's a finite
amount of resources and they have to

3936
02:09:20,621 --> 02:09:21,454
get theirs.

3937
02:09:21,640 --> 02:09:24,160
And that's what leads to
people cheating on their taxes.

3938
02:09:24,161 --> 02:09:26,080
That's a reason people lying,

3939
02:09:26,110 --> 02:09:30,160
trying to steal money and stealing money
from their employers and shit along

3940
02:09:30,161 --> 02:09:30,940
those lines.

3941
02:09:30,940 --> 02:09:31,890
They're coming from,

3942
02:09:31,970 --> 02:09:32,570
from a,

3943
02:09:32,570 --> 02:09:34,300
a standpoint of famine.

3944
02:09:34,330 --> 02:09:36,640
Like there's stockpiling
nuts for the winter,

3945
02:09:36,910 --> 02:09:37,241
right?

3946
02:09:37,241 --> 02:09:40,390
They're not as comfortable about their
ability to generate new resources.

3947
02:09:41,230 --> 02:09:41,741
And that's,

3948
02:09:41,741 --> 02:09:43,300
that's a terrible mentality.

3949
02:09:43,540 --> 02:09:46,090
And that is a mentality and that,

3950
02:09:46,091 --> 02:09:47,050
that sort of,

3951
02:09:47,051 --> 02:09:51,550
those sort of philosophies and those
ideas can be reinforced or they can,

3952
02:09:51,580 --> 02:09:53,590
the opposite can be reinforced.

3953
02:09:53,700 --> 02:09:54,450
Uh,

3954
02:09:54,450 --> 02:09:54,610
uh,

3955
02:09:54,610 --> 02:09:58,960
generous bountiful mentality
can be enforced as well.

3956
02:09:58,990 --> 02:09:59,141
Yeah.

3957
02:09:59,141 --> 02:09:59,200
Yeah.

3958
02:09:59,200 --> 02:09:59,861
Well for us,

3959
02:09:59,861 --> 02:10:00,071
I mean,

3960
02:10:00,071 --> 02:10:03,790
it's going to be 15 to $20 million
to make Mtma into a medicine.

3961
02:10:03,820 --> 02:10:07,870
And the same for Psilocybin or LSD
and we don't have all that money.

3962
02:10:07,900 --> 02:10:08,733
It's crazy.

3963
02:10:09,070 --> 02:10:11,170
But it caused pharmaceutical
companies way,

3964
02:10:11,171 --> 02:10:11,980
way more than that.

3965
02:10:11,980 --> 02:10:16,720
It should cost the amount that it
costs to get one guy high on Mtma.

3966
02:10:17,320 --> 02:10:18,370
He should do it and go,

3967
02:10:18,371 --> 02:10:18,640
oh,

3968
02:10:18,640 --> 02:10:20,170
listen to me and make it legal for us.

3969
02:10:20,440 --> 02:10:21,310
Just stop.

3970
02:10:21,670 --> 02:10:22,630
Stop the bullshit.

3971
02:10:22,990 --> 02:10:23,450
Yeah.

3972
02:10:23,450 --> 02:10:27,040
But we've had to have that attitude
that the resources are out there.

3973
02:10:27,100 --> 02:10:30,820
And once we can demonstrate that
we can use them wisely as we grow,

3974
02:10:30,850 --> 02:10:32,050
the resources will grow.

3975
02:10:32,051 --> 02:10:32,884
And so far,

3976
02:10:33,140 --> 02:10:33,321
you know,

3977
02:10:33,321 --> 02:10:36,530
we're in our 27th year and
that's what's what's happening.

3978
02:10:36,710 --> 02:10:40,730
How happy are you now that you're seeing
all this like really tangible progress,

3979
02:10:41,180 --> 02:10:42,260
real tangible progress,

3980
02:10:42,770 --> 02:10:43,670
very happy.

3981
02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:45,080
But I'm also,

3982
02:10:45,520 --> 02:10:45,950
uh,

3983
02:10:45,950 --> 02:10:50,360
because I woke up to all this in
1971 and 72 right after the backlash.

3984
02:10:50,890 --> 02:10:51,500
Um,

3985
02:10:51,500 --> 02:10:52,970
I'm concerned a lot.

3986
02:10:52,971 --> 02:10:56,290
I'm trying to be very sensitive
about another backlash today.

3987
02:10:56,900 --> 02:10:57,980
I think it's possible.

3988
02:10:58,070 --> 02:10:59,690
I don't think it's impossible.

3989
02:10:59,691 --> 02:11:01,400
I don't think it's likely right now.

3990
02:11:02,090 --> 02:11:02,661
It just seems,

3991
02:11:02,661 --> 02:11:04,190
it seems like the information,

3992
02:11:04,191 --> 02:11:05,390
it's just too prevalent.

3993
02:11:05,630 --> 02:11:05,871
Well,

3994
02:11:05,871 --> 02:11:08,870
but how would you explain the fact that
we can't even do marijuana research?

3995
02:11:08,970 --> 02:11:11,190
Maybe there's a massive repression.

3996
02:11:11,191 --> 02:11:13,220
And so if all those
people should be in jail,

3997
02:11:13,610 --> 02:11:15,410
that's really what should happen.

3998
02:11:15,411 --> 02:11:18,350
Someone should realize what's going
on and start locking people up.

3999
02:11:18,530 --> 02:11:18,800
And I go,

4000
02:11:18,800 --> 02:11:21,740
let's play your game because
what you're doing is ridiculous.

4001
02:11:21,741 --> 02:11:25,130
You're ruining people's lives for
something that really should not be your

4002
02:11:25,131 --> 02:11:25,551
choice.

4003
02:11:25,551 --> 02:11:29,000
It should not be another person's
choice whether or not they masturbate.

4004
02:11:29,180 --> 02:11:31,790
And it should not be another person's
choice whether or not they smoke pot.

4005
02:11:31,820 --> 02:11:34,370
And it's really along the same lines.

4006
02:11:34,640 --> 02:11:34,971
Yeah,

4007
02:11:34,971 --> 02:11:37,400
well I'm not so sympathetic
with putting them in jail,

4008
02:11:37,401 --> 02:11:40,100
but I would like to take
the source of their power,

4009
02:11:40,250 --> 02:11:45,250
which is people's fear that they've
generated and others and try to get more.

4010
02:11:45,770 --> 02:11:48,290
That's why I'm so glad to
be talking with you in this,

4011
02:11:48,740 --> 02:11:49,460
you know,

4012
02:11:49,460 --> 02:11:51,740
podcasts to people to
try to educate them to,

4013
02:11:51,741 --> 02:11:55,790
to realize that there is a way where
we can work together and make things

4014
02:11:55,791 --> 02:11:56,180
better.

4015
02:11:56,180 --> 02:11:56,691
I agree.

4016
02:11:56,691 --> 02:12:01,250
But I think the people that have done
things that have put people in jail for

4017
02:12:01,251 --> 02:12:02,750
things along those lines for,

4018
02:12:02,900 --> 02:12:07,030
for selling pot or for growing
pot or from owning pot there,

4019
02:12:07,050 --> 02:12:08,030
they're criminals.

4020
02:12:08,240 --> 02:12:09,920
Those are societal criminals.

4021
02:12:09,950 --> 02:12:10,221
Well,

4022
02:12:10,221 --> 02:12:14,120
I'd say that they have a bridge to other
people's human rights without a doubt.

4023
02:12:14,121 --> 02:12:17,270
And they have done so with
full cultural support.

4024
02:12:17,300 --> 02:12:22,300
And I think the way to move forward is
not to be so punitive for those that did

4025
02:12:22,341 --> 02:12:22,431
it.

4026
02:12:22,431 --> 02:12:23,360
Although for some,

4027
02:12:23,361 --> 02:12:24,194
I mean,

4028
02:12:24,260 --> 02:12:24,740
uh,

4029
02:12:24,740 --> 02:12:25,091
but,

4030
02:12:25,091 --> 02:12:29,660
but to talk about evolution and to
talk about how a different approach is

4031
02:12:29,661 --> 02:12:30,321
necessary.

4032
02:12:30,321 --> 02:12:31,101
And you know,

4033
02:12:31,101 --> 02:12:32,870
whenever I'm in Alaska,

4034
02:12:32,871 --> 02:12:36,350
when there was a medical
marijuana legalization bill
one of the first years ago,

4035
02:12:36,351 --> 02:12:41,351
there was this whole idea of reparations
to pay people that were in jail and the

4036
02:12:42,051 --> 02:12:43,730
polling that was done by the politic,

4037
02:12:43,760 --> 02:12:45,800
by the people trying to
pass this initiative.

4038
02:12:46,310 --> 02:12:46,730
Um,

4039
02:12:46,730 --> 02:12:48,320
it showed that that
was a really weak part.

4040
02:12:48,321 --> 02:12:52,510
So where you try to impose these penalties
on people for past behavior that at

4041
02:12:52,520 --> 02:12:54,740
time was sort of socially sanctioned.

4042
02:12:55,380 --> 02:12:57,090
What I meant by that was the,

4043
02:12:57,091 --> 02:13:02,091
the people that are actively working
like privatized prison unions and things

4044
02:13:02,271 --> 02:13:03,104
along those lines,

4045
02:13:03,110 --> 02:13:08,030
working to keep these drugs illegal
so that they profit and that's creepy.

4046
02:13:08,210 --> 02:13:08,670
There's,

4047
02:13:08,670 --> 02:13:08,900
yeah,

4048
02:13:08,900 --> 02:13:13,010
there's some real reprehensible
shit that's going on.

4049
02:13:13,040 --> 02:13:18,040
It's not as simple as they're acting
within culturally defined rules and

4050
02:13:18,231 --> 02:13:19,064
regulations.

4051
02:13:19,210 --> 02:13:23,170
There's some behind the scenes shady
shit that's based on deception.

4052
02:13:23,200 --> 02:13:25,820
Well that the stuff like
that is should be illegal,

4053
02:13:26,200 --> 02:13:26,510
you know?

4054
02:13:26,510 --> 02:13:31,510
But I think that the corporate
capitalistic approach
that we have does permit

4055
02:13:31,861 --> 02:13:32,040
that

4056
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:32,670
kind of stuff.

4057
02:13:32,670 --> 02:13:36,660
And it permits lobbying
congress and it permits this,

4058
02:13:36,720 --> 02:13:40,140
this process where people try to get their
own interests advanced sometimes over

4059
02:13:40,141 --> 02:13:41,070
the interests of others.

4060
02:13:41,480 --> 02:13:42,930
And isn't it fascinating that,

4061
02:13:43,860 --> 02:13:45,540
I don't know if you feel like this,

4062
02:13:45,541 --> 02:13:50,541
but that the thing that would fix the
woes that society has more than anything

4063
02:13:52,231 --> 02:13:55,560
is a thing that these people were
trying to keep from becoming legal.

4064
02:13:55,720 --> 02:13:55,881
I,

4065
02:13:55,881 --> 02:13:57,360
that might be the big race.

4066
02:13:57,390 --> 02:14:02,340
The big race might be recognizing that
there are some fantastic tools to change

4067
02:14:02,341 --> 02:14:03,870
the consciousness of this culture.

4068
02:14:04,260 --> 02:14:04,770
Right.

4069
02:14:04,770 --> 02:14:08,910
And I think that idea of thinking about
them as tools is really the crucial

4070
02:14:08,940 --> 02:14:12,450
distinction because they're not
good or bad in and of themselves.

4071
02:14:12,780 --> 02:14:13,920
It's how they're used.

4072
02:14:13,921 --> 02:14:15,810
And our whole drug policy is,

4073
02:14:15,811 --> 02:14:16,261
there's good,

4074
02:14:16,261 --> 02:14:17,094
bad,

4075
02:14:17,100 --> 02:14:18,360
good drugs and bad drugs,

4076
02:14:18,361 --> 02:14:22,200
bad drugs are illegal and good
drugs and get a burger king.

4077
02:14:22,580 --> 02:14:22,980
Yeah.

4078
02:14:22,980 --> 02:14:24,660
Or from the pharmaceutical company.

4079
02:14:24,690 --> 02:14:29,690
But it's all about good and bad
when it's actually how you use it.

4080
02:14:29,971 --> 02:14:34,971
And even the drug that was demonized the
most in a way in the 50s in the 60s was

4081
02:14:34,981 --> 02:14:35,640
thalidomide.

4082
02:14:35,640 --> 02:14:40,110
The drug that was the medical drug
that caused birth defects in babies.

4083
02:14:40,440 --> 02:14:44,640
And the FDA stopped that in the u s
but it was prevalent throughout Europe.

4084
02:14:45,120 --> 02:14:50,120
And now thalidomide has become a Madison
and the same kind of shrinking of blood

4085
02:14:50,221 --> 02:14:51,031
vessels and things.

4086
02:14:51,031 --> 02:14:54,870
It's used in leprosy and it's
used in cancer treatment.

4087
02:14:55,200 --> 02:14:59,370
So a drug that was among
the most demonized of all
has now been approved by the

4088
02:14:59,371 --> 02:15:02,550
FDA with certain kinds of
safety procedures to make
sure pregnant women don't

4089
02:15:02,551 --> 02:15:03,384
get it.

4090
02:15:03,570 --> 02:15:08,130
But it's the idea that these are tools
and we have the ability to approach these

4091
02:15:08,131 --> 02:15:13,131
tools in an intelligent way and a
respectful way or in a reckless way.

4092
02:15:13,200 --> 02:15:18,200
And what we want to do is try to change
these value judgments and prohibition,

4093
02:15:20,490 --> 02:15:23,370
support people's human rights to
explore their own consciousness.

4094
02:15:23,930 --> 02:15:24,490
Uh,

4095
02:15:24,490 --> 02:15:28,560
they have freedom of thought and to
find a way to integrate into a society

4096
02:15:28,561 --> 02:15:29,760
that's moving forward.

4097
02:15:29,820 --> 02:15:31,200
How do you do that?

4098
02:15:31,230 --> 02:15:34,050
By getting through the corruption because
that's the only thing that's holding

4099
02:15:34,051 --> 02:15:34,620
it back.

4100
02:15:34,620 --> 02:15:38,490
Really the only thing holding it back
is corruption at this point with the

4101
02:15:38,491 --> 02:15:40,980
amount of data that's been
accumulated on medical marijuana.

4102
02:15:41,010 --> 02:15:41,790
Well,

4103
02:15:41,790 --> 02:15:42,250
okay.

4104
02:15:42,250 --> 02:15:43,083
It,

4105
02:15:43,380 --> 02:15:45,690
the amount of data
that's been accumulated,

4106
02:15:45,691 --> 02:15:45,781
the,

4107
02:15:45,781 --> 02:15:47,610
the government has been effective.

4108
02:15:47,970 --> 02:15:48,340
The,

4109
02:15:48,340 --> 02:15:52,500
the DEA parts of the government Niva in
preventing what's called the phase three

4110
02:15:52,501 --> 02:15:53,334
studies,

4111
02:15:53,430 --> 02:15:56,880
the large scale definitive studies
that by law congress has created,

4112
02:15:56,881 --> 02:15:59,190
FDA must have to prove
safety and efficacy.

4113
02:15:59,191 --> 02:16:04,191
So at this moment there is not enough
data of the kind that the FDA uses for any

4114
02:16:04,471 --> 02:16:05,100
other drug.

4115
02:16:05,100 --> 02:16:09,270
And if we accept the idea that the
FDA should regulate marijuana and

4116
02:16:09,271 --> 02:16:09,841
psychedelics,

4117
02:16:09,841 --> 02:16:11,100
like they do any other drug,

4118
02:16:11,640 --> 02:16:15,750
then we have to acknowledge that there's
not enough research for the FDA to

4119
02:16:15,751 --> 02:16:16,410
approve it.

4120
02:16:16,410 --> 02:16:20,850
It's people twist it and say the FDA
has rejected marijuana as a medicine,

4121
02:16:20,851 --> 02:16:21,684
which they have not.

4122
02:16:22,080 --> 02:16:25,960
We just don't have enough research that
way and they won't allow you to do phase

4123
02:16:25,961 --> 02:16:26,794
through research.

4124
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:28,980
And so that's why the states,

4125
02:16:29,080 --> 02:16:34,080
I think have enough evidence to make
it legal and patients and doctors have

4126
02:16:34,781 --> 02:16:36,760
enough evidence to decide to try it.

4127
02:16:36,850 --> 02:16:41,350
It's just that in our system that
we've created to try to make it so that

4128
02:16:41,620 --> 02:16:44,020
through science we don't
just see what we want to see,

4129
02:16:44,021 --> 02:16:46,870
but we kind of have a
closer view of what's there.

4130
02:16:47,200 --> 02:16:51,580
There are these procedures that still
need to be undertaken for marijuana and

4131
02:16:51,581 --> 02:16:52,690
also from an May.

4132
02:16:52,691 --> 02:16:56,220
So that's why I say we're probably
10 years away from making Mtma into a

4133
02:16:56,221 --> 02:16:58,180
medicine and I think we'd be five,

4134
02:16:58,181 --> 02:17:02,170
six years away from making marijuana
into an FDA approved medicine if the

4135
02:17:02,171 --> 02:17:03,790
repression would be lifted right today.

4136
02:17:04,240 --> 02:17:04,361
Now,

4137
02:17:04,361 --> 02:17:05,260
what are the,

4138
02:17:05,370 --> 02:17:09,970
what is the difference between the stage
that the FDA FDA requires and the data

4139
02:17:09,971 --> 02:17:11,140
that has been accumulated?

4140
02:17:11,500 --> 02:17:12,490
Well for,

4141
02:17:12,730 --> 02:17:14,440
there's the preclinical stage,

4142
02:17:14,590 --> 02:17:17,740
so what that means is preclinical
clinical means humans.

4143
02:17:17,770 --> 02:17:22,600
So there's a whole series of animal
studies looking at toxicity that are

4144
02:17:22,601 --> 02:17:26,200
required by the FDA before you
can get a drug into humans.

4145
02:17:27,220 --> 02:17:28,240
Once you've done that,

4146
02:17:28,270 --> 02:17:29,740
then there's phase one,

4147
02:17:29,741 --> 02:17:30,101
two,

4148
02:17:30,101 --> 02:17:35,101
three and four and phase one is working
with people who are not patients who are

4149
02:17:36,700 --> 02:17:41,170
healthy volunteers to try to categorize
what the drug does and what it does at

4150
02:17:41,171 --> 02:17:42,010
different doses.

4151
02:17:42,460 --> 02:17:46,180
And for certain drugs that are
especially toxic like cancer drugs,

4152
02:17:46,720 --> 02:17:48,880
they have like phase one,

4153
02:17:48,881 --> 02:17:53,881
a phase two where it's a combination where
the drug is so dangerous that it only

4154
02:17:54,311 --> 02:17:55,960
can be used in patients.

4155
02:17:56,290 --> 02:17:58,630
And so you do these dose finding studies,

4156
02:17:58,660 --> 02:18:01,840
looking at the side
effects and it in general,

4157
02:18:01,841 --> 02:18:02,830
that's what phase one is.

4158
02:18:02,830 --> 02:18:07,420
Phase two is where you start working
with patients and you start seeing what

4159
02:18:07,421 --> 02:18:08,050
does it do?

4160
02:18:08,050 --> 02:18:09,130
What is it good for?

4161
02:18:09,160 --> 02:18:10,720
How good is it?

4162
02:18:10,721 --> 02:18:11,740
What are your measures?

4163
02:18:11,741 --> 02:18:13,510
How well did your measures work?

4164
02:18:13,780 --> 02:18:16,930
How do you do the double blind to make
sure you're not seeing what you want to

4165
02:18:16,931 --> 02:18:17,440
see?

4166
02:18:17,440 --> 02:18:20,200
What is your scientific
methodology for the studies?

4167
02:18:20,660 --> 02:18:20,950
Um,

4168
02:18:20,950 --> 02:18:22,120
what is your treatment approach?

4169
02:18:22,121 --> 02:18:23,290
What dose are you using?

4170
02:18:23,710 --> 02:18:24,031
The,

4171
02:18:24,031 --> 02:18:25,150
that's for phase two.

4172
02:18:25,151 --> 02:18:27,310
And that can take years
and years and years.

4173
02:18:27,311 --> 02:18:29,050
I mean we've been phase to,

4174
02:18:29,580 --> 02:18:29,860
uh,

4175
02:18:29,860 --> 02:18:31,270
for Mtma for,

4176
02:18:31,290 --> 02:18:32,123
uh,

4177
02:18:32,470 --> 02:18:34,660
about nine years so far.

4178
02:18:35,050 --> 02:18:35,883
Wow.

4179
02:18:36,070 --> 02:18:36,341
Yeah.

4180
02:18:36,341 --> 02:18:40,030
Starting in 2004 is when
we got the first permit.

4181
02:18:40,060 --> 02:18:45,060
We actually had permission in 2000 from
2000 and 2001 in Spain for Mtma for

4182
02:18:45,730 --> 02:18:46,180
PTSD.

4183
02:18:46,180 --> 02:18:50,650
And we had some media attention that was
very positive on the radio and the main

4184
02:18:51,010 --> 02:18:55,510
TV and newspapers and radio and it
motivated the anti-drug authority,

4185
02:18:55,511 --> 02:18:57,490
the forces of oppression
to shut the study down.

4186
02:18:57,490 --> 02:19:01,150
And we weren't powerful enough
to overcome it in Spain.

4187
02:19:01,151 --> 02:19:05,190
And that's where it was first
started though with a study that,

4188
02:19:05,290 --> 02:19:08,890
that we were working with
women survivors of rape with.

4189
02:19:09,320 --> 02:19:09,581
Okay.

4190
02:19:09,581 --> 02:19:10,720
But then you've got phase two.

4191
02:19:10,721 --> 02:19:15,100
So then once you have figured out
your designs and the magnitude and the

4192
02:19:15,101 --> 02:19:16,240
variance of the effect,

4193
02:19:16,241 --> 02:19:19,720
how strong is it and how common is it?

4194
02:19:19,750 --> 02:19:23,350
Is there a large number of people that
don't respond at all or do most people

4195
02:19:23,351 --> 02:19:26,560
respond then you can size
your phase three studies?

4196
02:19:26,740 --> 02:19:27,950
So with marijuana,

4197
02:19:28,310 --> 02:19:33,310
we have enormous amount of information
up to the phase two level and the FDA

4198
02:19:34,521 --> 02:19:39,521
will have more information about marijuana
Mtma LSD than about any other drug

4199
02:19:40,371 --> 02:19:42,680
that they've ever approved
in their entire history.

4200
02:19:43,400 --> 02:19:45,440
And the reason is because they,

4201
02:19:45,650 --> 02:19:48,560
the research is usually done with
hundreds or thousands of people.

4202
02:19:49,040 --> 02:19:50,990
10,000 is about as high as you go.

4203
02:19:51,140 --> 02:19:55,460
But we've had LSD used by tens of millions
of people and marijuana by hundreds

4204
02:19:55,460 --> 02:19:56,240
of millions of people.

4205
02:19:56,240 --> 02:19:57,380
And we know the one,

4206
02:19:57,860 --> 02:20:02,480
one in a million side effects or the one
in 5 million side effect that we only

4207
02:20:02,481 --> 02:20:05,240
discover from pharmaceutical
drugs once they're approved.

4208
02:20:05,600 --> 02:20:09,230
So it would not take a long time.

4209
02:20:09,260 --> 02:20:11,540
We already know that we
would work with marijuana,

4210
02:20:11,541 --> 02:20:13,610
with a nausea control for cancer,

4211
02:20:13,611 --> 02:20:14,480
chemotherapy,

4212
02:20:14,510 --> 02:20:15,770
marijuana for pain,

4213
02:20:16,310 --> 02:20:20,210
particularly for people on opiates
because we've already shown in phase two

4214
02:20:20,211 --> 02:20:24,590
studies funded by the state of California
that when you combine marijuana with,

4215
02:20:25,040 --> 02:20:25,221
uh,

4216
02:20:25,221 --> 02:20:25,791
opiates,

4217
02:20:25,791 --> 02:20:28,850
that people get better pain control and
they don't need as much of the opiates

4218
02:20:29,480 --> 02:20:32,290
and because of Oxycontin
and all these big concerns.

4219
02:20:32,291 --> 02:20:37,291
So we know the areas that we would study
with marijuana and we know the safety

4220
02:20:37,791 --> 02:20:38,624
profile.

4221
02:20:38,630 --> 02:20:43,630
So we mainly need to just do studies
and 200 5,500 people to look at the

4222
02:20:44,751 --> 02:20:46,880
particular patient groups
that we want to approve.

4223
02:20:46,881 --> 02:20:51,830
We have to get high quality standardized
medical grade marijuana to do it in.

4224
02:20:52,310 --> 02:20:52,610
Um,

4225
02:20:52,610 --> 02:20:56,150
and so maybe we're five years away if
the political barriers were removed right

4226
02:20:56,151 --> 02:20:56,361
today,

4227
02:20:56,361 --> 02:20:57,230
which they're not.

4228
02:20:57,290 --> 02:20:58,160
What happens

4229
02:20:58,800 --> 02:21:03,800
to someone that takes LSD and goes crazy
because I've had many people tell me

4230
02:21:05,791 --> 02:21:06,271
stories.

4231
02:21:06,271 --> 02:21:11,271
I know the Syd Barrett story from
a pink Floyd is a famous one.

4232
02:21:11,730 --> 02:21:12,840
I don't know if it's true,

4233
02:21:13,230 --> 02:21:17,160
but that was the word was that he had
taken too much acid and lost his mind.

4234
02:21:17,650 --> 02:21:19,180
I think it's possible,

4235
02:21:19,990 --> 02:21:23,170
but it depends on the supporters context.

4236
02:21:23,350 --> 02:21:27,210
And before you ask them about
the candy flipping about MDA,

4237
02:21:27,220 --> 02:21:28,053
Lsd,

4238
02:21:28,300 --> 02:21:33,300
so in in the future when people are
having this very difficult LSD experience,

4239
02:21:36,070 --> 02:21:37,900
maybe they go to the
emergency room or something.

4240
02:21:38,290 --> 02:21:42,820
Adding Mtma takes it from this
terrifying sense of dying.

4241
02:21:42,821 --> 02:21:46,510
You go destruction and grounds it
so that people can work through it.

4242
02:21:46,690 --> 02:21:51,690
So I think that LSD has that potential
to destabilize people but in a supportive

4243
02:21:52,751 --> 02:21:57,751
environment that can be helpful
and handled in support it.

4244
02:21:58,271 --> 02:21:59,230
So that's fascinating.

4245
02:21:59,670 --> 02:22:03,510
The candy flipping aspect over the
adding end VMA might mitigate some of the

4246
02:22:03,511 --> 02:22:06,650
negative effects of the stress
that you could get from the,

4247
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:07,833
the acid experience.

4248
02:22:07,890 --> 02:22:08,250
Oh yeah.

4249
02:22:08,250 --> 02:22:09,083
Completely.

4250
02:22:10,050 --> 02:22:10,620
Yeah.

4251
02:22:10,620 --> 02:22:11,460
And then you can,

4252
02:22:11,700 --> 02:22:13,020
so you know,

4253
02:22:13,140 --> 02:22:14,320
one possible,

4254
02:22:14,321 --> 02:22:15,154
um,

4255
02:22:15,510 --> 02:22:20,310
thing we would like to study one day
would be to take people who are dying and

4256
02:22:20,430 --> 02:22:22,230
start them like we did in Switzerland.

4257
02:22:22,231 --> 02:22:26,730
Start them with LSD and
four later administer MTMA.

4258
02:22:26,790 --> 02:22:29,400
So that way LSD peaks in
around three and a half hours,

4259
02:22:29,401 --> 02:22:29,581
three,

4260
02:22:29,581 --> 02:22:30,361
three and a half hours.

4261
02:22:30,361 --> 02:22:35,361
So they go through the whole challenging
Lsd of letting go of opening up and

4262
02:22:36,700 --> 02:22:37,110
it's,

4263
02:22:37,110 --> 02:22:37,860
it's,

4264
02:22:37,860 --> 02:22:38,160
you know,

4265
02:22:38,160 --> 02:22:39,420
hopefully they can make it through that.

4266
02:22:39,720 --> 02:22:44,340
And then at the four hours you give Mtma
and then everything softens and they

4267
02:22:44,341 --> 02:22:45,810
can take it in more.

4268
02:22:45,811 --> 02:22:48,150
And then they integrate
as they're coming down.

4269
02:22:48,780 --> 02:22:49,180
Oh,

4270
02:22:49,180 --> 02:22:52,170
so you ride one wave run to the next year,

4271
02:22:52,200 --> 02:22:53,400
or if they're flipping out,

4272
02:22:53,401 --> 02:22:55,890
if it's too painful or
too difficult for them,

4273
02:22:55,891 --> 02:23:00,891
maybe at the one at the two hours you
could administer it Mtma there and you

4274
02:23:01,171 --> 02:23:03,090
don't even have to minister
full dose of MD May.

4275
02:23:03,091 --> 02:23:06,600
It'd be like a half dose of Md Mace
softens it somewhat because they have a

4276
02:23:06,601 --> 02:23:07,620
synergistic effect.

4277
02:23:07,710 --> 02:23:07,951
Yeah,

4278
02:23:07,951 --> 02:23:08,610
they do.

4279
02:23:08,610 --> 02:23:09,443
They do.

4280
02:23:09,750 --> 02:23:11,220
They go the two of them together.

4281
02:23:11,221 --> 02:23:12,240
What's the difference between,

4282
02:23:12,390 --> 02:23:13,170
well,

4283
02:23:13,170 --> 02:23:14,190
it's more like,

4284
02:23:14,191 --> 02:23:15,024
um,

4285
02:23:15,490 --> 02:23:16,060
there,

4286
02:23:16,060 --> 02:23:18,120
there's an expansion aspect to it,

4287
02:23:18,121 --> 02:23:20,640
but there's a grounding aspect as well.

4288
02:23:21,180 --> 02:23:23,610
So you think that's a really
good combination then?

4289
02:23:23,640 --> 02:23:24,380
That's how I,

4290
02:23:24,380 --> 02:23:25,410
I think it is.

4291
02:23:25,411 --> 02:23:26,100
Yeah.

4292
02:23:26,100 --> 02:23:26,880
On the other hand,

4293
02:23:26,880 --> 02:23:27,391
for,

4294
02:23:27,391 --> 02:23:28,224
um,

4295
02:23:29,300 --> 02:23:29,731
you know,

4296
02:23:29,731 --> 02:23:31,530
sometimes for spiritual purposes,

4297
02:23:31,531 --> 02:23:32,300
let's say,

4298
02:23:32,300 --> 02:23:32,760
uh,

4299
02:23:32,760 --> 02:23:35,030
where people are looking
for this ego dissolution,

4300
02:23:35,490 --> 02:23:36,323
um,

4301
02:23:36,510 --> 02:23:36,781
you know,

4302
02:23:36,781 --> 02:23:37,680
you start with Lsd,

4303
02:23:37,681 --> 02:23:39,090
you start with Psilocybin,

4304
02:23:39,380 --> 02:23:40,213
you know,

4305
02:23:40,650 --> 02:23:42,690
sometimes the experiences last day,

4306
02:23:42,691 --> 02:23:43,050
10,

4307
02:23:43,050 --> 02:23:44,220
10 hours or more.

4308
02:23:44,221 --> 02:23:46,140
Sometimes if you don't fully,

4309
02:23:46,530 --> 02:23:48,990
if you open up to the
energy flowing through you,

4310
02:23:49,320 --> 02:23:52,530
then the psychedelic experience tends
to take a shorter amount of time.

4311
02:23:52,800 --> 02:23:55,080
And if you end into this resistance,

4312
02:23:55,440 --> 02:23:58,170
because for whatever reasons
it's really difficult.

4313
02:23:58,440 --> 02:24:03,360
It prolongs the experience and once
you enter into those kinds of places,

4314
02:24:03,361 --> 02:24:05,070
if you were to add Mtma,

4315
02:24:05,640 --> 02:24:08,580
then people can integrate
it more helpfully.

4316
02:24:09,260 --> 02:24:10,190
Have you done any studies,

4317
02:24:10,191 --> 02:24:13,340
like with the differences between like
hippie flipping and candy flipping using

4318
02:24:13,341 --> 02:24:14,510
mushrooms instead of,

4319
02:24:14,570 --> 02:24:15,140
uh,

4320
02:24:15,140 --> 02:24:16,900
is there any difference to that or,

4321
02:24:16,950 --> 02:24:17,610
well again,

4322
02:24:17,610 --> 02:24:19,080
we haven't done any studies,

4323
02:24:19,081 --> 02:24:19,260
right?

4324
02:24:19,260 --> 02:24:24,000
This can't be because combining
drugs but more or less it's,

4325
02:24:24,001 --> 02:24:24,631
it's similar.

4326
02:24:24,631 --> 02:24:27,690
MTMA blends with ketamine,

4327
02:24:27,750 --> 02:24:31,410
even MTMA grounds people
with ketamine ground shame.

4328
02:24:31,920 --> 02:24:32,541
Why not about it?

4329
02:24:32,541 --> 02:24:32,800
What did it,

4330
02:24:32,800 --> 02:24:34,950
it's probably going to turn
out to be like a jack and coke.

4331
02:24:35,310 --> 02:24:35,911
Well people were like,

4332
02:24:35,911 --> 02:24:36,780
why didn't you guys do this?

4333
02:24:36,781 --> 02:24:39,000
From the beginning it was my
favorite thing in college.

4334
02:24:39,870 --> 02:24:41,070
It was so hard to find.

4335
02:24:41,071 --> 02:24:42,290
But when you did you,

4336
02:24:42,291 --> 02:24:43,910
you bought a lot and you just saved,

4337
02:24:43,920 --> 02:24:44,753
you sat on this.

4338
02:24:45,090 --> 02:24:46,060
How did you do it?

4339
02:24:46,080 --> 02:24:47,340
Did in terms of the timing,

4340
02:24:47,341 --> 02:24:48,720
cause I I'm talking about where,

4341
02:24:49,020 --> 02:24:49,853
you know,

4342
02:24:50,220 --> 02:24:55,220
did you take them both at the same time
or actually a designed together where it

4343
02:24:55,471 --> 02:24:55,921
was like,

4344
02:24:55,921 --> 02:24:59,250
it was like a candy where it
had both of the chemicals in it.

4345
02:24:59,530 --> 02:25:00,960
That's the only way I've ever done it.

4346
02:25:00,961 --> 02:25:05,250
Now I've done it since then but done it
separately with mushrooms and then just

4347
02:25:05,251 --> 02:25:06,030
taking,

4348
02:25:06,030 --> 02:25:06,540
you know,

4349
02:25:06,540 --> 02:25:06,960
uh,

4350
02:25:06,960 --> 02:25:08,310
yeah I think it was,

4351
02:25:08,370 --> 02:25:10,260
I took it when I was peaking.

4352
02:25:10,261 --> 02:25:12,540
I would dose myself with the Mali,

4353
02:25:12,570 --> 02:25:16,710
which would then take whatever an hour
or so 45 minutes later you'd start

4354
02:25:16,711 --> 02:25:17,544
feeling it.

4355
02:25:17,700 --> 02:25:18,510
But yeah,

4356
02:25:18,510 --> 02:25:18,961
it's great.

4357
02:25:18,961 --> 02:25:19,980
I love those two together.

4358
02:25:21,010 --> 02:25:21,661
If you need any,

4359
02:25:21,661 --> 02:25:24,220
if there's a way to sign
up to any of your things,

4360
02:25:24,220 --> 02:25:24,611
let me know.

4361
02:25:24,611 --> 02:25:28,240
I was robbed by gunpoint so I got the
post traumatic stress if you need that.

4362
02:25:28,560 --> 02:25:30,070
Well we need people to be,

4363
02:25:30,730 --> 02:25:34,200
it's not as easy as getting a prescription
for marijuana to get a nurse study

4364
02:25:34,201 --> 02:25:34,660
sheet.

4365
02:25:34,660 --> 02:25:35,920
We have independent raters.

4366
02:25:35,930 --> 02:25:39,930
She would have to have treatment resistant
means you have to have had PTSD and

4367
02:25:40,260 --> 02:25:41,093
diagnosis.

4368
02:25:42,040 --> 02:25:45,500
Very minor compared to
like a soldier PTSD too.

4369
02:25:45,750 --> 02:25:48,670
They're dealing with
real debilitating issues.

4370
02:25:48,671 --> 02:25:49,960
You just got freaked out one night.

4371
02:25:50,070 --> 02:25:52,480
Well I got a gun in my chest and I
thought I was going to die and it was,

4372
02:25:53,170 --> 02:25:56,370
I scared of black people for six months
and it still comes back to me once in a

4373
02:25:56,371 --> 02:25:57,330
while when it's dark out.

4374
02:25:57,390 --> 02:25:57,810
Right,

4375
02:25:57,810 --> 02:25:58,410
right.

4376
02:25:58,410 --> 02:26:03,410
Well people can sign up online to
donate to maps because we're funded by

4377
02:26:04,210 --> 02:26:05,070
individuals.

4378
02:26:05,071 --> 02:26:07,800
The pharmaceutical companies aren't
interested because these drugs are off

4379
02:26:07,801 --> 02:26:09,420
patent and they're only
offered a few times.

4380
02:26:09,421 --> 02:26:11,550
So far we've not been able
to get a government grant,

4381
02:26:11,580 --> 02:26:14,460
although we are working with the
national instead of mental health.

4382
02:26:14,461 --> 02:26:15,294
And we are,

4383
02:26:15,600 --> 02:26:15,960
uh,

4384
02:26:15,960 --> 02:26:20,130
Senator Rockefeller from West Virginia
recently sent a letter to the assistant

4385
02:26:20,131 --> 02:26:21,810
secretary of defense for health affairs,

4386
02:26:22,350 --> 02:26:23,183
um,

4387
02:26:23,400 --> 02:26:24,211
saying that,

4388
02:26:24,211 --> 02:26:24,361
uh,

4389
02:26:24,361 --> 02:26:26,580
MDA PTSD research should be looked into.

4390
02:26:26,820 --> 02:26:27,061
So,

4391
02:26:27,061 --> 02:26:30,900
but we have yet to obtain any kind of
federal funding or pharmaceutical funding

4392
02:26:30,901 --> 02:26:33,510
or major pharmaceutical
or major foundations.

4393
02:26:33,540 --> 02:26:37,770
So we're more individuals and family
foundations trying to bring this,

4394
02:26:38,210 --> 02:26:38,940
um,

4395
02:26:38,940 --> 02:26:39,960
research forward.

4396
02:26:40,120 --> 02:26:40,331
Well,

4397
02:26:40,331 --> 02:26:42,010
I think what you're doing
is awesome cause you,

4398
02:26:42,020 --> 02:26:42,211
you,

4399
02:26:42,211 --> 02:26:44,110
you guys are bringing legitimacy to this.

4400
02:26:44,111 --> 02:26:48,760
It would never be done by guys like
Brian or myself and a or any of the other

4401
02:26:48,761 --> 02:26:51,310
people that are out there
enjoying the fruits of your labor.

4402
02:26:51,311 --> 02:26:55,700
And the fact that these doors have
been broken down now on or open,

4403
02:26:55,701 --> 02:26:56,410
I should say,

4404
02:26:56,410 --> 02:27:00,940
and work is being done and evidence is
being put forth that really can't be

4405
02:27:00,941 --> 02:27:01,900
refuted anymore.

4406
02:27:01,901 --> 02:27:04,260
It's slowly but slowly
starting to accumulate.

4407
02:27:04,640 --> 02:27:05,030
Yeah.

4408
02:27:05,030 --> 02:27:07,160
I would say that this can't be refuted.

4409
02:27:07,161 --> 02:27:10,700
We're right now we're at this stage
where we have to replicate our results

4410
02:27:11,180 --> 02:27:12,650
because that's the key part of science.

4411
02:27:12,651 --> 02:27:12,801
You,

4412
02:27:12,801 --> 02:27:13,940
you may have done it once,

4413
02:27:13,941 --> 02:27:16,760
but can you do it again
and again and again?

4414
02:27:16,761 --> 02:27:20,390
And that's where we have still to prove.

4415
02:27:20,480 --> 02:27:24,140
So we haven't completely
proven our case yet.

4416
02:27:24,580 --> 02:27:25,100
Uh,

4417
02:27:25,100 --> 02:27:25,933
but it's,

4418
02:27:26,230 --> 02:27:26,690
you know,

4419
02:27:26,690 --> 02:27:27,081
moving,

4420
02:27:27,081 --> 02:27:28,130
we hope in that direction.

4421
02:27:28,590 --> 02:27:28,730
Oh,

4422
02:27:28,730 --> 02:27:29,600
that's awesome man.

4423
02:27:29,630 --> 02:27:30,740
And I think,

4424
02:27:30,741 --> 02:27:31,190
uh,

4425
02:27:31,190 --> 02:27:33,410
I think there's really
exciting things coming up.

4426
02:27:33,800 --> 02:27:34,633
I really do.

4427
02:27:34,700 --> 02:27:37,340
I feel like our culture
is starting to shift.

4428
02:27:37,640 --> 02:27:38,361
And a,

4429
02:27:38,361 --> 02:27:43,070
I think it's stuff like what
you're doing is a big part of that.

4430
02:27:43,190 --> 02:27:44,210
Getting that information,

4431
02:27:44,390 --> 02:27:45,820
having that on the Internet land,

4432
02:27:45,850 --> 02:27:47,090
allowing people to share links,

4433
02:27:47,120 --> 02:27:48,350
allowing people to go to,

4434
02:27:48,620 --> 02:27:52,100
whether it's maps.org or any
of the different website.

4435
02:27:52,110 --> 02:27:54,470
erowid.org era was a great website.

4436
02:27:55,070 --> 02:27:55,580
Their fiscal

4437
02:27:55,580 --> 02:27:56,151
sponsor,

4438
02:27:56,151 --> 02:27:57,440
we went to college together.

4439
02:27:58,790 --> 02:28:01,760
We try to help other
organizations in that way.

4440
02:28:02,170 --> 02:28:02,451
Um,

4441
02:28:02,451 --> 02:28:07,451
I think this idea of getting
honest information out for
people to make their own

4442
02:28:07,941 --> 02:28:08,810
decisions.

4443
02:28:08,940 --> 02:28:09,260
Yeah,

4444
02:28:09,260 --> 02:28:10,640
that's what we're about.

4445
02:28:10,970 --> 02:28:11,870
It's a matter of time,

4446
02:28:11,960 --> 02:28:12,320
right?

4447
02:28:12,320 --> 02:28:13,030
Hopefully.

4448
02:28:13,030 --> 02:28:13,250
Yeah.

4449
02:28:13,250 --> 02:28:14,420
Well my dad is hilarious.

4450
02:28:14,421 --> 02:28:19,421
My Dad is 86 and three quarters and
he sent me an email today and it said,

4451
02:28:19,900 --> 02:28:20,270
uh,

4452
02:28:20,270 --> 02:28:23,810
here's a link to an
about a marijuana reform.

4453
02:28:23,840 --> 02:28:24,350
And he said,

4454
02:28:24,350 --> 02:28:24,501
oh,

4455
02:28:24,501 --> 02:28:26,090
it's going to be legal in my lifetime.

4456
02:28:27,140 --> 02:28:27,960
Wow.

4457
02:28:27,960 --> 02:28:28,740
I was like,

4458
02:28:28,740 --> 02:28:29,001
Dad.

4459
02:28:29,001 --> 02:28:29,301
I said,

4460
02:28:29,301 --> 02:28:30,140
I hope you're right.

4461
02:28:30,141 --> 02:28:30,530
You know,

4462
02:28:30,530 --> 02:28:32,300
even if you have to live another 20 years,

4463
02:28:32,530 --> 02:28:35,210
I would have never thought in
2013 it was still being illegal.

4464
02:28:35,640 --> 02:28:36,351
And when I was a kid,

4465
02:28:36,351 --> 02:28:36,620
I would,

4466
02:28:36,620 --> 02:28:38,070
I thought it was a matter of time.

4467
02:28:38,120 --> 02:28:38,490
Well,

4468
02:28:38,490 --> 02:28:40,580
I was on the board of normal for awhile,

4469
02:28:40,850 --> 02:28:45,850
quite awhile and I was with people who
started normal in 1970 and 71 and thought

4470
02:28:46,161 --> 02:28:47,480
it would be legal in a few years.

4471
02:28:47,540 --> 02:28:49,340
So that sort of temper is my,

4472
02:28:49,690 --> 02:28:50,360
uh,

4473
02:28:50,360 --> 02:28:52,460
sense of time to be with people who,

4474
02:28:53,210 --> 02:28:53,750
uh,

4475
02:28:53,750 --> 02:28:54,021
you know,

4476
02:28:54,021 --> 02:28:57,080
over 40 years ago thought it was only
going to be a few years away that

4477
02:28:57,081 --> 02:28:58,070
marijuana would be legal.

4478
02:28:58,080 --> 02:29:01,430
Unfortunately they're still working
to try to help bring that about.

4479
02:29:01,550 --> 02:29:05,630
Do you lose enthusiasm sometimes when
you see that it's still illegal after all

4480
02:29:05,650 --> 02:29:05,960
this?

4481
02:29:05,960 --> 02:29:06,231
No,

4482
02:29:06,231 --> 02:29:07,370
it's the um,

4483
02:29:07,830 --> 02:29:08,663
it's about,

4484
02:29:08,720 --> 02:29:09,620
it's a worthy,

4485
02:29:09,670 --> 02:29:10,820
like on a worthy opponent.

4486
02:29:10,850 --> 02:29:12,110
It's a worthy goal.

4487
02:29:12,260 --> 02:29:15,020
And so I think we just
do what we want to do.

4488
02:29:15,021 --> 02:29:20,021
There's times when I felt like I was so
blocked that I needed to do something

4489
02:29:21,110 --> 02:29:22,790
where I could actually see change.

4490
02:29:22,820 --> 02:29:25,640
And so I stopped work for
a week and painted my house

4491
02:29:27,180 --> 02:29:28,430
and that was great.

4492
02:29:28,820 --> 02:29:30,430
That's real.

4493
02:29:30,600 --> 02:29:35,030
Must must get some feel like you're
spinning your wheels sometimes.

4494
02:29:35,060 --> 02:29:40,060
Well for years and we just spent four
years with a Health Canada to trying to

4495
02:29:40,431 --> 02:29:44,660
get an import export permit to
bring in eight grams of MDA.

4496
02:29:44,660 --> 02:29:49,660
And this is after Health Canada had
approved the protocol and our IRB had

4497
02:29:49,791 --> 02:29:51,320
approved of protocol and the,

4498
02:29:51,710 --> 02:29:52,490
uh,

4499
02:29:52,490 --> 02:29:56,540
four years it took and they went through
all these ridiculous things about the

4500
02:29:56,541 --> 02:29:58,820
pharmacy had to have bulletproof glass,

4501
02:29:59,180 --> 02:30:00,890
it had to have all these alarm systems,

4502
02:30:00,970 --> 02:30:04,550
class people are going to come in
and steal your eight grams of acid.

4503
02:30:05,220 --> 02:30:06,470
That was eight grams.

4504
02:30:06,471 --> 02:30:06,651
Yeah.

4505
02:30:06,651 --> 02:30:11,090
That would be in a safe and the safe had
to be disguised in a wooden cabinet and

4506
02:30:11,091 --> 02:30:15,410
the safe had to be bolted to them before
they went harder than the u s it was

4507
02:30:15,411 --> 02:30:16,244
ridiculous.

4508
02:30:16,310 --> 02:30:17,720
But we eventually,

4509
02:30:17,880 --> 02:30:18,713
you know,

4510
02:30:18,770 --> 02:30:19,430
prevailed.

4511
02:30:19,430 --> 02:30:21,770
We just took every ridiculous
thing and we did it.

4512
02:30:21,890 --> 02:30:22,280
I mean,

4513
02:30:22,280 --> 02:30:23,780
my policy is surrender.

4514
02:30:24,100 --> 02:30:24,620
You know,

4515
02:30:24,620 --> 02:30:28,400
when there's certain kinds of irrational
things coming from people who are more

4516
02:30:28,401 --> 02:30:28,910
powerful,

4517
02:30:28,910 --> 02:30:29,743
try to give it to them.

4518
02:30:30,230 --> 02:30:34,460
Well that's probably why you're in the
position that you're in your facilitator

4519
02:30:34,461 --> 02:30:34,850
of this.

4520
02:30:34,850 --> 02:30:37,190
I'm willing to dialogue venture forth.

4521
02:30:37,470 --> 02:30:38,303
Yeah.

4522
02:30:38,420 --> 02:30:38,750
Yeah.

4523
02:30:38,750 --> 02:30:41,960
And there are parts that are exciting,

4524
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,440
that are connections that you know,

4525
02:30:44,540 --> 02:30:45,590
are just coming together.

4526
02:30:45,800 --> 02:30:47,840
Like even for the national
incident mental health there,

4527
02:30:47,850 --> 02:30:48,740
there was a,

4528
02:30:48,741 --> 02:30:49,574
um,

4529
02:30:49,940 --> 02:30:50,450
uh,

4530
02:30:50,450 --> 02:30:52,040
in the late 1980s,

4531
02:30:52,041 --> 02:30:54,740
the fellow who's the current head of the
nationalist of mental health was doing

4532
02:30:54,741 --> 02:30:57,260
Mtma neurotoxicity research in animals.

4533
02:30:57,261 --> 02:31:00,350
And I visited him and he was,

4534
02:31:00,400 --> 02:31:00,890
um,

4535
02:31:00,890 --> 02:31:01,310
you know,

4536
02:31:01,310 --> 02:31:05,280
this sort of hidden away in the
countryside animal research lab to,

4537
02:31:05,380 --> 02:31:05,660
you know,

4538
02:31:05,660 --> 02:31:07,970
not attract all these
animal rights protesters.

4539
02:31:07,971 --> 02:31:10,550
And we had to go through all his
guards and Barb wire and stuff.

4540
02:31:11,210 --> 02:31:16,070
But he seemed like he was
sincerely interested in the
question and wasn't trying

4541
02:31:16,071 --> 02:31:19,130
to twist the results to
justify the drug war.

4542
02:31:19,590 --> 02:31:21,690
And we developed a respect.

4543
02:31:21,910 --> 02:31:23,130
I certainly respected him.

4544
02:31:23,820 --> 02:31:25,740
And about two years ago,

4545
02:31:25,770 --> 02:31:26,551
year and a half ago,

4546
02:31:26,551 --> 02:31:29,310
I wrote him an email and
I hadn't talked to him.

4547
02:31:29,390 --> 02:31:31,860
And since that point he's now become
the head of the national incident mental

4548
02:31:31,861 --> 02:31:32,694
health.

4549
02:31:32,730 --> 02:31:33,600
And I just said,

4550
02:31:33,630 --> 02:31:37,860
is now a good time to apply
for a grant for MD May,

4551
02:31:37,861 --> 02:31:40,800
PTSD research or is it so politically hot?

4552
02:31:40,801 --> 02:31:41,880
It's just not worth it.

4553
02:31:42,300 --> 02:31:42,931
And he said,

4554
02:31:42,931 --> 02:31:43,800
now is the time.

4555
02:31:43,890 --> 02:31:48,890
And he appointed someone else inside the
Nmh who is an expert at PTSD to help us

4556
02:31:49,351 --> 02:31:54,210
prepare applications that are
more likely to be accepted.

4557
02:31:54,240 --> 02:31:58,920
But what he did say is that the actual
decisions are made by peer reviewers,

4558
02:31:59,040 --> 02:32:01,740
the way they've set up for
government money to be distributed,

4559
02:32:01,741 --> 02:32:03,510
that they bring in the scientist.

4560
02:32:03,511 --> 02:32:08,430
And he said the system of peer review
as well known not to be sympathetic with

4561
02:32:08,431 --> 02:32:09,264
innovation.

4562
02:32:10,020 --> 02:32:12,270
So even though we have all the support,

4563
02:32:12,271 --> 02:32:13,680
it's still may not work.

4564
02:32:13,800 --> 02:32:17,310
It's hard to get systems to
accept innovation and change.

4565
02:32:17,340 --> 02:32:21,450
What can people at home that are
listening to this podcast or watching it,

4566
02:32:21,480 --> 02:32:22,720
what can they do to,

4567
02:32:22,790 --> 02:32:27,300
to help you to help keep
this momentum going?

4568
02:32:27,670 --> 02:32:28,503
Well,

4569
02:32:28,560 --> 02:32:29,041
first off,

4570
02:32:29,041 --> 02:32:30,060
become a member.

4571
02:32:30,170 --> 02:32:30,810
Um,

4572
02:32:30,810 --> 02:32:33,090
sign up for a monthly membership.

4573
02:32:33,240 --> 02:32:33,960
Um,

4574
02:32:33,960 --> 02:32:37,170
we just had the incredible conference.

4575
02:32:37,420 --> 02:32:42,330
We're a psychedelic science 2013 largest
psychedelic conference that we've ever

4576
02:32:42,331 --> 02:32:44,760
had in the u s over 1900 people.

4577
02:32:44,761 --> 02:32:46,050
There's a whole,

4578
02:32:46,051 --> 02:32:48,210
I WASC attract the biggest Iowasca,

4579
02:32:48,240 --> 02:32:48,750
uh,

4580
02:32:48,750 --> 02:32:50,820
conference ever and clinical research.

4581
02:32:50,821 --> 02:32:51,780
And um,

4582
02:32:51,830 --> 02:32:54,270
I was approached by a more Amara,

4583
02:32:54,480 --> 02:32:59,480
this group that helps groups crowdsource
a transcription and translation of

4584
02:33:00,091 --> 02:33:05,091
these talks and videos are
not searchable on Google,

4585
02:33:05,790 --> 02:33:09,000
but when you do a transcript or
if you do transcript of the shows,

4586
02:33:09,001 --> 02:33:12,780
people can then search on the transcripts
in that gets them to the video.

4587
02:33:13,050 --> 02:33:13,861
So people,

4588
02:33:13,861 --> 02:33:14,850
if they're interested,

4589
02:33:15,060 --> 02:33:17,300
and it would be a tremendous
thing for them to learn to,

4590
02:33:17,370 --> 02:33:19,980
to go to the maps website,

4591
02:33:20,450 --> 02:33:25,450
map s.org to our psychedelic science 2013
conference page and you could sign up

4592
02:33:26,011 --> 02:33:29,820
if you wanted to listen
to some of these lectures,

4593
02:33:29,821 --> 02:33:33,690
which are tremendous and transcribe
or translate them if you know other

4594
02:33:33,691 --> 02:33:34,524
languages.

4595
02:33:34,620 --> 02:33:35,310
Awesome.

4596
02:33:35,310 --> 02:33:35,670
Yeah,

4597
02:33:35,670 --> 02:33:37,140
there's other things people could do.

4598
02:33:37,141 --> 02:33:38,100
I just have a Twitter page.

4599
02:33:38,520 --> 02:33:39,331
We have Twitter,

4600
02:33:39,331 --> 02:33:42,090
we have a map maps.

4601
02:33:42,091 --> 02:33:43,220
News apps do is,

4602
02:33:43,230 --> 02:33:43,411
yeah,

4603
02:33:43,411 --> 02:33:46,280
we have a tremendous
social media team already.

4604
02:33:46,310 --> 02:33:50,640
Remember we are going to do a Indiegogo
campaign starting probably in a week or

4605
02:33:50,641 --> 02:33:55,641
so to raise $10,000 for the Zendo
project at burning man are harm reduction

4606
02:33:56,250 --> 02:33:59,580
program so people could tell
other people about that.

4607
02:33:59,970 --> 02:34:00,840
And then we're going to go,

4608
02:34:00,841 --> 02:34:02,400
as we said earlier,

4609
02:34:02,670 --> 02:34:07,670
to a probably a $250,000 request for
the study with veterans with Mtma.

4610
02:34:08,820 --> 02:34:09,450
Um,

4611
02:34:09,450 --> 02:34:11,640
I think people can come
out to their families,

4612
02:34:11,641 --> 02:34:16,260
people can come out to people that they
just talk about and not be so reticent

4613
02:34:16,290 --> 02:34:20,080
if psychedelics been helpful or
even if they've not been helpful,

4614
02:34:20,140 --> 02:34:20,351
you know,

4615
02:34:20,351 --> 02:34:22,210
to talk about how,

4616
02:34:22,450 --> 02:34:23,600
what they learned about,

4617
02:34:23,610 --> 02:34:25,480
about what they think are these tools.

4618
02:34:25,481 --> 02:34:26,620
Maybe they use them poorly,

4619
02:34:26,621 --> 02:34:27,520
maybe they used them well,

4620
02:34:27,521 --> 02:34:30,190
but I think look at the
gay rights movement and

4621
02:34:30,630 --> 02:34:31,463
thinking about this,

4622
02:34:31,470 --> 02:34:35,340
the wrong tool for the wrong job too
because they didn't have education about

4623
02:34:35,341 --> 02:34:35,910
it.

4624
02:34:35,910 --> 02:34:36,360
Yeah.

4625
02:34:36,360 --> 02:34:40,830
And we're finding that
people that sometimes you
psychedelics at festivals for

4626
02:34:41,070 --> 02:34:42,570
what I would say is the wrong reason,

4627
02:34:42,571 --> 02:34:45,270
just to have a fun time
and not the right reason.

4628
02:34:45,510 --> 02:34:48,480
Well you told us it's beautiful,

4629
02:34:48,481 --> 02:34:51,510
but I think you have to be
ready for the difficult stuff.

4630
02:34:52,230 --> 02:34:54,450
And if you're trying to
suppress the difficult stuff,

4631
02:34:54,451 --> 02:34:56,790
that's when people get into trouble.

4632
02:34:56,820 --> 02:34:59,810
You should have more joking around.

4633
02:35:00,200 --> 02:35:02,760
But I think the celebratory
use is really important.

4634
02:35:02,761 --> 02:35:07,761
And that's why for us medicalization is
not the for maps as a five o one c three

4635
02:35:08,790 --> 02:35:10,260
not change to change the laws.

4636
02:35:10,290 --> 02:35:11,730
We're about medicalization.

4637
02:35:11,760 --> 02:35:15,150
But I think as a society
we need spiritual use.

4638
02:35:15,151 --> 02:35:16,200
We need personal growth,

4639
02:35:16,201 --> 02:35:16,831
creativity.

4640
02:35:16,831 --> 02:35:19,770
We need a broader drug policy,

4641
02:35:19,830 --> 02:35:24,690
which would have adults have
the right to use psychedelics.

4642
02:35:24,691 --> 02:35:29,310
I think it would be like the driver's
license model where you would perhaps have

4643
02:35:29,330 --> 02:35:30,560
a certain education,

4644
02:35:30,590 --> 02:35:34,380
you have to pass a test and
maybe even to start out.

4645
02:35:34,380 --> 02:35:35,650
So we avoid backlash.

4646
02:35:35,690 --> 02:35:39,000
There would be psychedelic clinics where
you would go have an experience under

4647
02:35:39,390 --> 02:35:41,310
supervision and if you did it well,

4648
02:35:41,740 --> 02:35:42,210
uh,

4649
02:35:42,210 --> 02:35:44,120
meaning you didn't totally
flip out or you know,

4650
02:35:44,130 --> 02:35:45,720
then you would have the
right to buy it on your own.

4651
02:35:46,020 --> 02:35:48,660
And I think what we
would do with children,

4652
02:35:48,661 --> 02:35:51,480
I think drugs would be illegal for minors,

4653
02:35:51,481 --> 02:35:52,500
legal for adults.

4654
02:35:52,830 --> 02:35:57,830
But 23 states in the United States have
a parental override for alcohol that if

4655
02:35:59,491 --> 02:36:02,070
you want to give your
kid alcohol in 23 states,

4656
02:36:02,071 --> 02:36:02,904
you can do that.

4657
02:36:03,480 --> 02:36:07,020
And I think that that's how we
handle under h is that we leave it,

4658
02:36:07,290 --> 02:36:09,570
not the government prohibited at all,

4659
02:36:09,571 --> 02:36:13,320
but that it's families decide among
themselves how they want to handle it.

4660
02:36:14,220 --> 02:36:15,053
That's awesome.

4661
02:36:15,480 --> 02:36:17,310
One more question then
I'm gonna let you go.

4662
02:36:17,480 --> 02:36:17,940
Uh,

4663
02:36:17,940 --> 02:36:22,440
Terence Mckenna's stoned ape
theory was a fascinating,

4664
02:36:22,441 --> 02:36:27,441
the proposal that human beings evolved
from lower hominids because we got in

4665
02:36:28,351 --> 02:36:32,340
contact with psychedelic
mushrooms and his theory,

4666
02:36:32,341 --> 02:36:33,630
I don't know if it's correct,

4667
02:36:33,660 --> 02:36:35,430
but according to him and his brother,

4668
02:36:35,610 --> 02:36:36,271
his brother,

4669
02:36:36,271 --> 02:36:36,600
um,

4670
02:36:36,600 --> 02:36:39,120
if you just Google search the,

4671
02:36:39,121 --> 02:36:39,600
uh,

4672
02:36:39,600 --> 02:36:41,100
Dennis Mckenna podcast,

4673
02:36:41,101 --> 02:36:42,300
I don't remember which number it is.

4674
02:36:42,570 --> 02:36:44,670
You can find it pretty easily
and it with a quick search.

4675
02:36:44,940 --> 02:36:49,290
But he gave some really
interesting scientific reasons
for why he believes it's,

4676
02:36:49,350 --> 02:36:52,140
it's a very possible that
that's what happened.

4677
02:36:52,350 --> 02:36:55,530
The doubling of the human brain size
over a period of 2 million years.

4678
02:36:55,740 --> 02:36:57,490
All this attributed to sy silicide.

4679
02:36:57,740 --> 02:36:57,920
Well,

4680
02:36:57,920 --> 02:37:01,070
Dennis was one of the speakers at the
conference and so people could actually

4681
02:37:01,400 --> 02:37:03,590
translate and transcribe
his talk if they wanted.

4682
02:37:03,820 --> 02:37:04,060
Awesome.

4683
02:37:04,060 --> 02:37:04,660
Beautiful.

4684
02:37:04,660 --> 02:37:06,450
But I think that the,

4685
02:37:06,590 --> 02:37:06,970
the,

4686
02:37:06,970 --> 02:37:11,970
the deeper question is can the apes
that we are today evolve further with

4687
02:37:13,161 --> 02:37:13,994
mushrooms?

4688
02:37:14,360 --> 02:37:16,100
And I think answer to that is clearly

4689
02:37:16,100 --> 02:37:20,690
yes clear whether the apes of several
million years or a hundred thousand years

4690
02:37:20,690 --> 02:37:21,650
ago it used mushrooms.

4691
02:37:21,890 --> 02:37:26,240
It's certainly plausible and I
hard to say one way or the other.

4692
02:37:26,241 --> 02:37:28,820
I am not in a position to
say I believe it or not.

4693
02:37:28,821 --> 02:37:32,920
I think Terrence said some
things that were pretty um,

4694
02:37:32,930 --> 02:37:34,070
exaggerated.

4695
02:37:34,130 --> 02:37:37,700
Like this whole idea that the end of the
Mayan calendar was going to be the end

4696
02:37:37,701 --> 02:37:38,331
of the world.

4697
02:37:38,331 --> 02:37:41,230
And while I was in a cable,

4698
02:37:41,300 --> 02:37:45,080
well he talked about a massive
constants in a shift and it would all be

4699
02:37:45,081 --> 02:37:47,230
different and like per space,

4700
02:37:47,690 --> 02:37:52,130
he talked about that we were going
to reach a point of technological

4701
02:37:52,131 --> 02:37:52,964
singularity.

4702
02:37:53,150 --> 02:37:57,230
He thought that we were going to reach
a point of infinite novelty and that

4703
02:37:57,260 --> 02:38:02,180
right tracking it with his TimeWave
zero algorithm that he created,

4704
02:38:02,510 --> 02:38:05,840
he created this really sketchy thing
when he was on mushrooms because based on

4705
02:38:05,841 --> 02:38:09,590
the each thing that's supposedly a map
novelty or human innovation that you

4706
02:38:09,591 --> 02:38:10,490
could put it through a graph.

4707
02:38:10,490 --> 02:38:12,290
But I think when you
get really fucking high,

4708
02:38:12,291 --> 02:38:14,150
you could see patterns in almost anything.

4709
02:38:14,360 --> 02:38:14,870
Yes.

4710
02:38:14,870 --> 02:38:15,740
And he had this,

4711
02:38:15,800 --> 02:38:20,800
this eating pattern that he had chased
down for like 20 plus years in created a

4712
02:38:21,081 --> 02:38:23,210
formal mathematical program.

4713
02:38:23,390 --> 02:38:24,230
He had some,

4714
02:38:24,231 --> 02:38:24,620
uh,

4715
02:38:24,620 --> 02:38:29,620
mathematical experts actually engaged him
in dialogue and one's in disagreement,

4716
02:38:30,050 --> 02:38:30,231
right?

4717
02:38:30,231 --> 02:38:30,381
Yeah.

4718
02:38:30,381 --> 02:38:31,160
So I think if,

4719
02:38:31,160 --> 02:38:31,851
if you know,

4720
02:38:31,851 --> 02:38:36,710
Dennis Mckenna just wrote a book brothers
at the screaming abyss and there's a

4721
02:38:37,040 --> 02:38:42,040
good discussion about some of the
criticism and the value of time wave zero.

4722
02:38:42,801 --> 02:38:45,560
So I was actually,

4723
02:38:45,561 --> 02:38:49,520
Terrance was the one that started help
start MTMA research because we were at a

4724
02:38:49,521 --> 02:38:50,570
conference at Esselyn,

4725
02:38:50,600 --> 02:38:55,600
it was in 1983 and it was already clear
because of Dallas and stuff that Mtma

4726
02:38:56,570 --> 02:38:58,190
was being used in public setting.

4727
02:38:58,191 --> 02:38:59,780
And that the crackdown would come.

4728
02:39:00,200 --> 02:39:04,240
And so the underground therapists
and the shoguns chemists,

4729
02:39:04,730 --> 02:39:06,590
so we had this meeting
to figure out what to do.

4730
02:39:07,160 --> 02:39:07,880
Um,

4731
02:39:07,880 --> 02:39:09,650
and Terrence was like,

4732
02:39:10,280 --> 02:39:12,680
forget about Mtma it's from the lab.

4733
02:39:12,681 --> 02:39:13,760
It's gotta be a plant,

4734
02:39:13,850 --> 02:39:14,241
you know,

4735
02:39:14,241 --> 02:39:14,871
mushrooms,

4736
02:39:14,871 --> 02:39:16,010
thousands of years,

4737
02:39:16,011 --> 02:39:16,970
plants are better,

4738
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:17,211
you know,

4739
02:39:17,211 --> 02:39:18,200
we can trust them,

4740
02:39:18,201 --> 02:39:20,600
they're from nature and you know,

4741
02:39:20,601 --> 02:39:23,810
and look at all these risks
of Mtma and all this stuff.

4742
02:39:23,840 --> 02:39:25,370
And I was like,

4743
02:39:25,371 --> 02:39:26,204
well,

4744
02:39:26,900 --> 02:39:28,130
I don't see these risks.

4745
02:39:28,250 --> 02:39:29,083
And so,

4746
02:39:29,350 --> 02:39:29,660
um,

4747
02:39:29,660 --> 02:39:34,660
and I also don't believe that plants are
drugs from plants are inherently better

4748
02:39:35,601 --> 02:39:36,790
tools that,

4749
02:39:36,900 --> 02:39:40,280
that we're part of nature that comes
from the human mind is out there.

4750
02:39:40,310 --> 02:39:41,143
So I said,

4751
02:39:41,180 --> 02:39:43,280
I'll put up $1,000 towards an MDA study.

4752
02:39:43,281 --> 02:39:44,690
We'll see how risky it really is.

4753
02:39:45,290 --> 02:39:46,190
And then Dick Price,

4754
02:39:46,191 --> 02:39:47,900
who founded Eslan like 30 seconds,

4755
02:39:47,960 --> 02:39:48,680
10 seconds later,

4756
02:39:48,680 --> 02:39:48,861
said,

4757
02:39:48,861 --> 02:39:49,790
I'll put up a thousand hours.

4758
02:39:49,850 --> 02:39:54,380
And so it was in response to Terrence
going on about plant medicines being best

4759
02:39:54,381 --> 02:39:59,381
and MD may being super dangerous that we
did this study and kept it quiet until

4760
02:40:00,231 --> 02:40:01,670
the DEA moved to criminalize.

4761
02:40:01,670 --> 02:40:03,050
And then we surfaced with the study.

4762
02:40:03,260 --> 02:40:04,350
That's interesting.

4763
02:40:04,351 --> 02:40:05,184
Well that's great.

4764
02:40:05,420 --> 02:40:06,140
Yeah,

4765
02:40:06,140 --> 02:40:07,070
that's very funny.

4766
02:40:07,370 --> 02:40:10,550
I've always wanted to hear different
people's take on that fear because I

4767
02:40:10,551 --> 02:40:11,870
thought it was a fascinating theory.

4768
02:40:12,200 --> 02:40:15,900
The idea that humans became
us because of psychedelics.

4769
02:40:16,170 --> 02:40:20,220
And the best culprit is mushrooms
because they're like sort of built in.

4770
02:40:20,460 --> 02:40:22,410
You don't have to cook and
you have to do anything weird.

4771
02:40:22,420 --> 02:40:22,890
You don't have to,

4772
02:40:22,890 --> 02:40:23,460
you know,

4773
02:40:23,460 --> 02:40:24,810
extract anything,

4774
02:40:25,140 --> 02:40:27,000
just chew away and boom,

4775
02:40:27,090 --> 02:40:28,020
here comes the boom.

4776
02:40:28,170 --> 02:40:28,441
Well,

4777
02:40:28,441 --> 02:40:33,441
I felt when I had my bar Mitzvah when
I was 13 it did not turn me into a man

4778
02:40:35,790 --> 02:40:36,690
coming of age.

4779
02:40:37,060 --> 02:40:40,740
That's a really unrealistic
expectation to 13 shit.

4780
02:40:40,770 --> 02:40:42,110
I mean I was the oldest of four.

4781
02:40:42,120 --> 02:40:42,841
That's what my parents,

4782
02:40:42,841 --> 02:40:44,230
so that's what I expect.

4783
02:40:44,260 --> 02:40:44,851
That belt went,

4784
02:40:44,851 --> 02:40:47,790
came up with that back when
people only live in to be 30 yeah.

4785
02:40:48,060 --> 02:40:48,960
So when I,

4786
02:40:49,560 --> 02:40:50,610
and I was disappointed,

4787
02:40:50,611 --> 02:40:51,444
I was the same.

4788
02:40:51,500 --> 02:40:52,760
It was really Bauer.

4789
02:40:52,860 --> 02:40:53,310
I was like,

4790
02:40:53,310 --> 02:40:57,520
I remember being in bed for the whole
week and I'm thinking a lot of people must

4791
02:40:57,521 --> 02:41:00,090
have had their bar mitzvahs
that day and God must be slow.

4792
02:41:00,180 --> 02:41:01,860
And he'll come around to me eventually.

4793
02:41:02,070 --> 02:41:02,461
Oh,

4794
02:41:02,461 --> 02:41:03,294
that's hilarious.

4795
02:41:03,350 --> 02:41:03,660
You know,

4796
02:41:03,660 --> 02:41:04,770
and then finally,

4797
02:41:04,771 --> 02:41:05,461
nothing happened.

4798
02:41:05,461 --> 02:41:07,140
And I just was sad about it.

4799
02:41:07,440 --> 02:41:09,510
But when I took LSD for the first time,

4800
02:41:09,990 --> 02:41:14,820
I felt that it touched the parts of my
psyche that I had hoped my bar Mitzvah

4801
02:41:14,821 --> 02:41:15,630
would touch.

4802
02:41:15,630 --> 02:41:16,250
Wow.

4803
02:41:16,250 --> 02:41:18,870
That was d better than Barmitzvahs next

4804
02:41:20,400 --> 02:41:22,680
you got to mean so far the show.

4805
02:41:23,220 --> 02:41:23,850
Well,

4806
02:41:23,850 --> 02:41:24,661
thank you very much,

4807
02:41:24,661 --> 02:41:24,901
Rick.

4808
02:41:24,901 --> 02:41:29,640
This is a really awesome glad we could
pull it off to spite the gay pride parade

4809
02:41:29,641 --> 02:41:30,810
in the Illuminati.

4810
02:41:31,080 --> 02:41:32,310
Trying to hold it back.

4811
02:41:32,820 --> 02:41:33,720
I made it happen.

4812
02:41:33,870 --> 02:41:36,330
Go to maps.org Ladies and gentlemen,

4813
02:41:36,360 --> 02:41:37,200
and uh,

4814
02:41:37,230 --> 02:41:37,741
what is it?

4815
02:41:37,741 --> 02:41:38,580
Maps,

4816
02:41:38,600 --> 02:41:38,940
uh,

4817
02:41:38,940 --> 02:41:40,500
news on Twitter.

4818
02:41:40,501 --> 02:41:41,850
Please follow that as well.

4819
02:41:42,360 --> 02:41:43,440
And Facebook.

4820
02:41:43,441 --> 02:41:45,130
And let's do this again sometime.

4821
02:41:45,150 --> 02:41:45,480
Yeah,

4822
02:41:45,480 --> 02:41:47,910
I figured have done it three
hours if I wasn't so tired.

4823
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:48,301
